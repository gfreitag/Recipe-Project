Title: FAT FREE MOCHA-ALMOND BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 50 Biscotti
1/2 c  Whole unblanched almonds
2 1/2 c  All-purpose white flour
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs
2 lg Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Unsweetened coco powder
2 ts Instant coffee
1 oz Unsweet. chocolate - melted
1/2 ts Pure almond extract
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and
bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Set aside.

Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk
together eggs, egg whites and vanilla, and add to the dry
ingredients. Mix just until smooth. In a small bowl, combine cocoa,
instant coffee and 4 tsp. water. Divide the dough in half. To one
half, add the cocoa mixture and melted chocolate. Mix just until
incorporated. To the other half, stir in almond extract and almonds.

Place half of the almond dough on a well-floured work surface. Pat
into a 4x8 inch rectangle. Top with half of chocolate dough. Roll up
into a log b, then roll back and forth to form a 14 inch log, 1 1/2
inches thick. Repeat with the remaining doughs. Place the logs on a
prepared baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until firm to
the touch. Transfer the logs to a rack to cool. Reduce the oven
temperature to 300 degrees F.

Cut the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch slices. Stand the slices
upright on the baking sheet and bake for 40 more minutes. Let cool
before storing in an air tight container.

* This makes 2 loaves. For easy doubling of this recipe, make 2
recipes, one all almond and one all chocolate.

* Before putting chocolate dough on top of almond dough, brush a
little water between them. Also, an egg white whisked with a little
water brushed on logs before baking gives them a nice look.
