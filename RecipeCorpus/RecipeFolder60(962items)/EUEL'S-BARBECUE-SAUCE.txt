Mix and simmer. Add a dash of Tabasco and/or mustard for hotness till
it tastes right. "Don't put it on the meat while cooking 'cause you
will cause the sugar to caramelize and char. This used to be a secret
but since I'm retired it makes no-never-mind. I makes more money now
after I retired. If I knew I could make this much money as a retiree,
I would have quit working when I was 20." (By "retired" Euel means he
now runs a private catering company and cooks only for those who
wisely seek out his skills.)
