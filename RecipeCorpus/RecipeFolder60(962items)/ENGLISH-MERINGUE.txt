Categories: Cakes, Barry
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Egg Whites
pn Salt
6 oz Caster Sugar
8 oz Strawberries
5 fl Double Cream
Preheat the oven to gas mark 2, 300F, 150C, and line a baking sheet
with greaseproof paper. Beat the egg whites until foamy and thick but
not completely stiff. Add the pinch of salt and continue to whisk,
adding a tablespoon of sugar at a time and whisking until each is
completely beaten in. Add all but onr tablespoon of sugar, by which
time the mixture should be absolutely firm. Fold in the last
tablespoon of sugar - don't whisk it - to give a nice texture to the
meringue. To make individual meringues, spoon one heaped tablespoon
for each meringue onto the baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes
to produce golden coloured meringues. Whip the cream until stiff and
slice the strawberries. When the meringues are ready, let them cool,
then spoon a layer of cream and a layer of strawberries onto the flat
side of a meringue and put the flat side of another meringue on top
