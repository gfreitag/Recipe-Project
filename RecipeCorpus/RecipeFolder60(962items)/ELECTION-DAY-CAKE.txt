2 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water (110 to 115
-degrees)
2 ts Sugar
4 1/2 c  Sifted flour
3/4 c  Butter OR regular margarine
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground mace
2    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Chopped citron
3/4 c  Chopped nuts
Confectioners Sugar Frosting
Sprinkle yeast on warm water; stir to dissolve. Add 2 tsp sugar and
1-1/2 cup flour and beat well by hand, or 2 minutes with electric
mixer at medium speed. Cover and let rise in warm place until bubbly,
about
30    minutes.

Meanwhile, cream butter and 1 c sugar until light and fluffy. Sift
remaining 3 c flour with salt, cinnamon, cloves, mace and nutmeg.

When yeast mixture is bubbly, add eggs to creamed butter and sugar
and beat well. Combine with yeast mixture. Add remaining dry
ingredients (flour, salt and spices), a little at a time, beating
with spoon after each addition. Beat until smooth. Stir in raisins,
citron and nuts. Pour into well greased and floured 10" tube pan.
Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.

Bake in moderate oven (375 degrees) 1 hour. Cool in pan 5 minutes;
turn out on rack to finish cooling. While faintly warm, spread with
Confectioners Sugar Frosting. Makes 12 to 16 servings.

CONFECTIONERS SUGAR FROSTING: To 1 c sifted confectioners sugar, add
enough milk or light cream to make mixture of spreading consistency.
Add 1/2 tsp vanilla and a dash of salt (or flavor with 1/2 tsp lemon
juice and 1/4 tsp grated lemon peel). Stir until smooth. Spread on
cake.
