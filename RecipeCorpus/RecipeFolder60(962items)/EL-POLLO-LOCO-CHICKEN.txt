pieces in single layer without crowding them, until the meat appears
milky white and the juices run clear, no longer pink. Allow to cool
in the broth, uncovered, while you prepare the basting sauce. Arrange
the chicken pieces skin-side up on broiler pan in single layer and
baste with enough of mixture to evenly coat skin side. Turn and baste
other side. Turn again to skin side up and broil 6" from the heat,
brushing with additional sauce every few minutes until skin is really
crispy and golden brown, approximately 5 to 8 minutes for large
pieces. BASTING MIXTURE-Mix juices, oil, turmericc, salt and pepper.
