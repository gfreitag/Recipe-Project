Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Prepared elderberry juice
1/4 c  Lemon juice

Follow package instructions for making cooked and canned jelly.
(Bringing juice and pectin to boil, then adding sugar, boiling hard
one minute, jarring up and processing in a boiling water bath for 5
minutes for half-pint jars.)  Looks like about five 8-oz jars jelly.
