Title: FAITH'S CHEVRE WITH HERBS SPREAD
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
4 oz Plain cream cheese -- room
Temperature
4 oz Chevre (100% goat's milk
Cheese)
Fresh Herbs -- to taste
Herbed chevre is readily available in most markets and cheese shops.
Pix likes to keep things simple and buys the herbed variety. Combine
the cheeses by hand. The cream cheese makes the combination easier to
spread. If you are using your own herbs, rosemary, tarragon, and
summer savory are good choices, alone or in combination. * * * Use
the spread to stuff snow or sugar snap peas, spread on cucumber or
zucchini rounds, sweetmeal biscuits, water biscuits, or slightly
toasted miniature bagels.
