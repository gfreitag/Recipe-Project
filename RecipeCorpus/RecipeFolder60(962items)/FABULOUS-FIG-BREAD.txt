Title: FABULOUS FIG BREAD
Categories: Breads, Low-fat
Yield: 22 Slices
1 c  Dried Figs, ground
1 c  -Boiling water
3/4 c  Pistachios
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
4 tb Margarine or butter

In a medium-sized heat-proof bowl, combine the figs and pistachios,
add boiling water and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 F.
Grease an 8-1/2" by 4-1/2" loaf pan.  In medium sized bowl, combine
the flour, baking soda and salt.  In a large bowl, beat the butter
until fluffy. Gradually beat in the sugar.  Add the egg and vanilla
and beat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightened.  Add the dry
ingredients and beat until just blended. With a spoon, blend in the
fig mixture. Turn into the prepared pan and bake 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or
until the bread just begins to pull away from the sides of the pan,
and the top springs back when lightly touched. Cool in pan on a rack
for 15 minutes, and then turn out and cool completely. Wrap in
plastic and store overnight before serving. Cut into thin slices.
