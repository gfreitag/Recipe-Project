Title: FAKE PANFORTE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
1 lb Assorted dried fruit*
1/4 lb Assorted nuts**
Chopped medium fine
1    Egg
4 tb Oil or margarine,
1/2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Caster sugar
1/4 ts Each nutmeg,cloves
And ginger
1 pn Salt, generous
(You can, of course, use half quantities, but stay with a whole egg).
*(dates, prunes, raisins, apricots etc., but no apples
or bananas), stoned or pitted where applicable **(macadamia,
almonds, pecan, hazel etc., but not peanuts), Mix all the ingredients
thoroughly, add enough water to make a semi-soft dough, and let stand
for at least 4 hrs. By then the dried fruit will have soaked up some
of the water and made the dough rather stiff.

Line big shallow baking form with oiled paper, pour dough and pat it
flat and even with a spatula. Cover with oiled paper, and bake on
medium heat for ca. 45 mins. This seems a long time, but the aim is
to get the finished product as dry as possible without charring. This
way it keeps indefinitely and tastes nearly as good as the original
panforte which is quite hard to find.
