mix well.  Add warm water (125 F. or so) and oil to flour mixture.
Blend at low speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes at medium speed.
By hand, gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a firm
dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover and
allow to rise in a warm place until double, about 45 minutes.  Punch
down dough.

On surface sprinkled with cornmeal, roll dough into 1/4" thickness.
With biscuit or cookie cutter, cut into 3 to 4" circles. Place
muffins on ungreased cookie sheets. Cover and allow to rise at room
temperature until double, about 30 minutes.

Bake on lightly oiled electric griddle or fry pan at 325 F. for about
8 minutes on each side, until deep golden brown.

Yield: About 12 muffins.
