Title: ELAINE'S DOLMAS
Categories: Vegetarian, Mcdougall, Main dish
Yield: 48 Servings
48    Grape leaves (about 1 jar)
1/2 c  Long grain brown rice;cooked
2 c  Onion; finely chopped
2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
2 tb Mint leaves; finely chopped
2 ts Dill weed
1/4 c  Pine nuts
1/4 c  Currants
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 c  Tofu TVP (optional)
Place grape leves briefly in a pan of warm water to separate them,
then drain on paper towels. Combine all other ingredients. Place
grape leaf vein side up, with the stem toward you. Put a mound of
rice mixture in the middle of the leaf (about 1 rounded tsp to 1
rounded tbsp, depending on the size of the leaf). Fold over sides and
roll up leaf. Layer the rolled leaves in a large saucepan (3 quart)
placing them side by side and close together. Press with a heavy heat
proof plate that fits inside the pan. Add enough boiling water to
cover leaves. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

Hints: Dolmas may be served warm or chilled. If warm, try serving
them with lemon sauce. If cold, serve them with garbanzo puree or
eggplant. Tabouli is also a good dish to serve at the same meal.
Dolmas are easy to take to a potluck dinner and they also make a very
special "company meal." Recipe for making tofu TVP follows. The use
of the tofu in this recipe is entirely optional; they are delicious
both ways.
