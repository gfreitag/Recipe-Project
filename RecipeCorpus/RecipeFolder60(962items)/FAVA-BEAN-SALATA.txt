MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
1 pn Paprika
Drain the dried beans and place in large saucepan with cold water to
cover. Bring slowly to a boil, drain and rinse. Rinse out the
saucepan, return the beans to the pan, and add cold water to cover by
3 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and gently simmer
25 to 30 minutes, or until soft. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the
cooking liquid. Remove the fava bean skins with your fingers and
spread the beans between layers of paper towels to dry. Heat 2
tablespoons of the olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Saute the
onion, garlic, carrot, celery, and bay leaf over medium-low heat for
15 to 20 minutes, or until dark golden brown, stirring occasionally
with a wooden spoon. Transfer to a food processor or blender
container and add the bread. With the machine running, add about two
thirds of the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and
process until thick and smooth. Add a few tablespoons of water if the
puree seems too thick, and add salt, pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon
juice to taste. Serve on a platter, sprinkled with the remaining
parsley and olive oil and the paprika. To make the traditional way:
Pound the cooked vegetable-bean mixture and the bread in a large
wooden mortar for 5 minutes. Slowly add about two thirds of the lemon
juice and then 3/4 cup of the olive oil. Pound for 5 minutes longer,
and add salt, pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon juice to taste.
