To make the tart-shell dough: In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in
the water. Add the salt and flour; mix well, using your hands if
necessary. Knead for a minute to form the dough into a ball. Cover
with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 3 hours.

To make the fennel-onion marmalade: In a 3-quart saucepan, combine
the water, onion, fennel, garlic, thyme and honey or syrup. Cook over
medium heat for 25 minutes, or until all the water has cooked away
and the vegetables are tender. Cool to room temperature.

To make the pearl onions: In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the onions,
water, vinegar and honey. Cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, or
until the water has cooked away and the onions are tender. Cool to
room temperature.

To assemble the tart: Roll the dough into a circle about 8 inches in
diameter and place on a baking sheet. Spread the fennel-onion
marmaladeover the dough, to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Top withthe
pearl onions.

Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the shell is
golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and garnish
with the chives. Cut into four wedges; serve warm or at room
temperature.
