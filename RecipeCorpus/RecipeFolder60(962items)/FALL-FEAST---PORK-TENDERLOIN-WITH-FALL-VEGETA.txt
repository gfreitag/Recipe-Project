Categories: Vegetables, Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Red pepper
1    Yellow pepper
3 md Zucchini
3 sm Onions
2 tb Olive oil
2    Pork tenderloins, 10 oz ea
Salt
Pepper
2 ts Fresh rosemary, chopped
1 c  White wine
1 c  Apple juice

Substitute other vegetables if you prefer but cut to the same size
for even cooking.

Cut peppers and zucchini into 1-inch dice. Peel onion and cut into
eight sections through the root.

Preheat oven to 350F 180C. In a skillet, on medium heat, brown pork
tenderloins on all sides. Remove to a baking dish large enough to
hold pork and vegetables. Season with salt, pepper and rosemary.

Add vegetables to skillet and saut until slightly brown and
crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Surround pork with vegetables.

Bake uncovered for 25 minutes, or until pork juices are no longer
pink. Pour wine and pan juices into skillet, add apple juice and
bring to boil. Boil until reduced by half. Stir in red current jelly
and simmer another minute.

Slice pork into thin slices, pour sauce over pork and garnish with
vegetables.
