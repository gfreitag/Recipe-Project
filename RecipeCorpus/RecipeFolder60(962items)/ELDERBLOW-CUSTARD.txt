Title: ELDERBLOW CUSTARD
Categories: Desserts, Flowers, Harned 1994, Wild foods
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Whole clusters of elderblow
2 c  Milk
1/3 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1 tb Semolina or
1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
2    Eggs; beaten
1    Egg white
2 tb Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
Elderberry jelly or
Sprinkle of cinnamon
Strip the flowers off the stems of two clusters of elderblow.  Put the
flowers in a pan with the milk and heat to scalding; hold just below
boiling point for several minutes to extract the flavor from the
elderblow. Strain milk and discard flowers.

Mix the sugar, salt and semolina (or tapioca) together.  Whisk in
beaten eggs and gradually add hot milk.  Return to low heat, or cook
over hot water, stirring constantly, until the custard coats a metal
spoon. Remove from heat instantly and set the pan in another pan
containing cold water to stop the cooking.  Cool slightly, then pour
into 4 dessert dishes. Chill in the refrigerator.

At serving time, make a meringue of the egg white beaten stiff with
the sugar.  Float a spoonful of meringue in the center of each
dessert dish and garnish with a bit of elderberry jelly or a sprinkle
of cinnamon. This dessert has a pleasant, subtle flowery flavor.
