1 1/2 c  Boiling water

Using a small ice-cream scoop, place 2 scoops whipped topping into
each of 10 dessert dishes for "eyeballs." Place a blueberry or raisin
in each scoop for the "pupil." Freeze 30 minutes, or until firm.

Meanwhile, stir boiling water into gelatin in large bowl at least two
minutes until completely dissolved. Mix cold water and ice cubes to
make 2-1/2 cups. Add to gelatin, stirring until slightly thickened.
Remove any remaining ice. Pour about 1/2 cup gelatin around the two
"eyeballs" in each dish, leaving the top of the "eyeballs" exposed.
Refrigerate 1-1/2 hours, or until firm.
