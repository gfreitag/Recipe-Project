Earthy and textured, this is great as a snack or at a party. For a
party, double this to make 1 large or 2 regular loaves.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. In a food processor or mixer bowl, add 2 1/2
cups of the flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Dissolve the yeast in the
warm water. Add the warm milk and yeast mixture. Add the egg. Knead
to make a soft dough, adding flour if needed. Allow 1 minute in a
food processor, using the metal blade or 5-to-10 minutes in a mixer
using a dough hook. Do not over knead. By hand, knead in the fennel
seeds, pine nuts and raisins. Place in an oiled plastic bag or oiled
bowl and turn to coat. Seal or cover and let rise until doubled,
about 1 hour. Punch down. Shape into a round. Let double again. Slash
the top. Brush with egg glaze. Bake 1/2 hour or until the bottom
sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on a rack. This freezes well.
