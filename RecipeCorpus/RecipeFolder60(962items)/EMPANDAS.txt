Title: EMPANDAS
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Cuba, Update
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Flour
2 tb Of sugar
1/2 ts Salt
5 tb Of Crisco
3 ea Eggs (slightly beaten)
Vino Seco
About 6-8 Tablespoons of
-cold water
Sift flour, sugar and salt together in a large bowl. Using a pastry
hook on your mixer or using a fork, cut in the Crisco into the flour
mixture until it is nice and crumbly. Make a deep will in center of
the flour mixture. Add beaten eggs and about 3-4 Tablespoons of Vino
Seco into center of bowl. Slowly mix together adding just enough
water ( a teaspoon at time) until the mixture comes together and
makes a soft dough. It shouldn't be stiff! Using a heavy rolling pin
or a pasta machine roll out the dough very thin. The pasta machine is
much faster. I usually run the dough from setting number 1 through
setting number 6. You're going to be rolling out enough dough to make
a circle about of a CD disk (if this makes sense) for each empanada.
In the center of this circle place your filling. This can be guava
paste (my favorite!), picadillo, or chicken. Once the filling is
placed in the middle of the dough, fold over one side over the other
forming a half-moon turnover. Using a pastry wheel or sharp knife,
trim the edge making sure they are sealed. Using a fork, go around
the edges pressing down with the tines making a nice decorative edge.
Fry in hot Crisco until golden. Empandas
