Title: EMPANADITAS  (PORK TURNOVERS)
Categories: Mexican, Pork
Yield: 8 Servings
8 ts Chilled margarine
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
3 tb Ice water
2 oz Cooked ground pork, crumbled
-(OR finely chopped
Cooked ham)
2 oz Monterey Jack or Cheddar
-cheese, shredded
1 ts Prepared spicy brown mustard
1 ds Crushed red pepper
1    Egg separated
1 tb Skim milk
Paprika Garnish: red bell pepper strips and cilantro leaves

In small bowl, with pastry blender or 2 knives, cut margarine into
flour until mixture resembles corn meal; sprinkle with ice water and,
using fork, mix to form soft dough. Roll dough between 2 sheets of
wax paper to form rectangle about 1/4 inch thick; remove paper and
use 2-inch diameter plain or fluted cookie cutter to cut dough into
rounds. Roll scraps of dough and continue cutting until all dough has
been used (should yield 24 rounds). Combine pork (or ham), cheese,
mustard, and red pepper in small bowl and set aside. Preheat oven to
375.

Beat egg white lightly and brush an equal amount onto each pastry
round. Spoon an equal amount of the meat mixture (about 1/2 rounded
teaspoon) onto center of each round; fold pastry over,
turnover-fashion, to enclose filling.  Press edges of dough together
to seal. Transfer turnovers to nonstick cookie sheet. Add milk to egg
yolk and beat lightly; brush an equal amount of mixture over each
turnover and sprinkle each with a dash of paprika.  Bake until
turnovers are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to warmed
serving tray; garnish with red pepper strips and cilantro. Chili
sauce or salsa can be served as a dipping sauce.

Makes 8 servings of 3 turnovers each.
