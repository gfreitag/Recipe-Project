until dough forms a ball.  Turn dough onto a piece of wax paper and
press it into a ball. Refrigerate until filling is prepared.

PREPARE FILLING:  If using fresh fruit mixture, chop fruit, prepare,
and set aside in bowl.
For Meat filling, add oil to frying pan along with chopped onion and
pressed garlic.  Saut on medium heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring
frequently.
Add crumbled ground beef and cook.  Add all other ingredients and
stir. If needed, add 1 or 2 tablespoons water. Cook together 3
minutes. Remove pan from heat and set aside.

TO FORM EMPA¥ADAS:  Lightly grease cookie sheet.  Work with a small
portion of dough at a time.  Using a floured work surface, roll out
dough to about 1/8" thickness. Cut dough into rounds, about 4" in
diameter.

Put a teaspoon of filling in the center of each dough round. Fold
half the dough over, covering the filling and making a half-moon
shape. Press a fork, dipped in flour, around dough edges to seal.
Brush top with a beaten egg for glaze.

brown.  Serve warm.  To prepare ahead, cool on wire racks, then wrap
airtight and freeze.
