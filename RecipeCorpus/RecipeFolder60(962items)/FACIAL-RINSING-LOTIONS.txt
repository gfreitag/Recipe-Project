** These facial lotions soothe and seem to revitalize oily skin.
Because they are so refreshing, either one is ideal after a sauna or
long session in the sun. If you can't find chamomile blossoms at your
health food store or pharmacy, try substituting fresh lilac,
wisteria, heather, or magnolia blossoms instead.

Boil all in a glass or enamel pan, 15 mins. Strain and retain liquid.
Cool before using. To Use: Wipe over face with fresh cotton ball or
pour into a pump-type plastic or glass container and spritz on face.
Let solution remain on for 30 mins, rinse with cool water, pat dry.
Hint: Apply, lay down for 30 mins with feet elevated past height of
head. EYE PUFFINESS: Teabags, slightly cooled, placed on the eyes
while you rest. Cider Stabilizing Rinse: Combine and gently wipe on
face. Let dry on skin. Big savings. Typed by Sherilyn Schamber
