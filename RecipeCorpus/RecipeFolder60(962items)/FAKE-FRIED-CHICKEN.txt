bread crumbs, or whatever you like. **I put in paprika, oregano,
thyme, some hot pepper flakes. Put enough cereal in the blender to
make 1 cup of crumbs.  You can use  diet bread or pita but cereal
makes a crunchier coating.  Put in your favorite spices and blend or
use FP. Take the skin off the chicken and coat with yougurt. Roll the
pieces in crumbs to coat. Put on a cookie sheet sprayed with Pam.
Bake in a 350 degree oven for about one hour.
