Title: ENSURING SAFE CANNED FOODS (PART 2 OF 2)
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Guide  EQUIPMENT AND METHODS NOT RECOMMENDED

Open-kettle canning and the processing of freshly filled jars in
conventional ovens, microwave ovens, and dishwashers are not
recommended, because these practices do not prevent all risks of
spoilage. Steam canners are not recommended because processing times
for use with current models have not been adequately researched.
Because steam canners do not heat foods in the same manner as
boiling-water canners, their use with boiling-water process times may
result in spoilage. It is not recommended that pressure processes in
excess of 15 PSI be applied when using new pressure canning
equipment. So-called canning powders are useless as preservatives and
do not replace the need for proper heat processing. Jars with wire
bails and glass caps make attractive antiques or storage containers
for dry food ingredients but are not recommended for use in canning.
One-piece zinc porcelain-lined caps are also no longer recommended.
Both glass and zinc caps use flat rubber rings for sealing jars, but
too often fail to seal properly.
