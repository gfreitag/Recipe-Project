Title: FAKE REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUPS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 12 Pieces
1 c  Peanut butter
1/3 c  Powdered sugar
12 oz Hershey's milk-chocolate
--chips
1/4 ts Salt
In a small bowl, mix the peanut butter and powdered sugar until firm.
Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler over hot, not boiling,
water.

You may also melt them in a microwave oven set on HIGH for 2 minutes,
stirring halfway through the heating time. Add the salt. Grease the
muffin-tin cups and spoon some chocolate into each cup, filling
halfway. With a spoon, draw the chocolate up the edges of each cup
until all sides are coated.  Cool in the refrigerator until firm.
Spread about a teaspoon of peanut butter onto the chocolate in each
cup, leaving room for the final chocolate layer.  Pour some chocolate
onto the top of each candy and spread it to the edges. Let sit at
room temperature, or covered in the refrigerator.  Turn out of the
pan when firm. Note: It is best to use a shallow muffin tin or candy
tin for this recipe. If you only have the regular-size muffin tin,
simply fill each tin only halfway with the chocolate and peanut
butter, unless you want to make giant-size mutant peanut butter cups,
then fill those cups all the way! Source: Todd Wilbur's book: Top
