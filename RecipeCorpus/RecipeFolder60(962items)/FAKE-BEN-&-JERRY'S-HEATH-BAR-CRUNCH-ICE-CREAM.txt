Title: FAKE BEN & JERRY'S HEATH BAR CRUNCH ICE CREAM
Categories: Desserts, Ice cream, Fake
Yield: 1 Quart
5    Health candy bars
3    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
3 c  Whipping cream
1 1/2 c  Half & half
3 ts Vanilla extract
Freeze the candy bars.  Beat the eggs by hand until fluffy. Slowly
beat in the sugar.  Add the cream, half & half, and vanilla and mix
well. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze. While the
ice cream is freezing, place the frozen candy bars in a plastic bag
and break them into small pieces with a knife handle. When the ice
cream is done, remove it from the ice cream maker and add the candy
pieces. Mix well with a large spoon and store in the freezer.
VARIATIONS: Try substituting other ingredients for the Health bar
chunks, just as Ben & Jerry have. Try Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,
Oreo cookies, Kit Kat bars, Rollo cups, M& Ms, and chunks of raw
cookie dough.
