Triple Sec, vanilla and nutmeg. Soak bread slices in the batter for

Melt the butter in 1 or 2 large saute pans, or on a griddle. Regulate
the heat so butter doesn't burn. Saute bread slowly in the bitter.
The heat should not be too high, or the bread won't cook through.
Saute on both sides until golden brown.

Serve with fruit preserves or maple syrup, if desired.
