Title: FAILED-FUDGE BROWNIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Pan
2 c  Failed fudge
1    Egg
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Milk
Good use of failed fudge: fudge that is too hard, too soft, too
runny, too sugary, too chewy, etc.

Proportions are as follows: for every 2 cups (roughly 1 pound yield)
of any failed fudge that is not runny, you'll need 1 egg, 1/2 cup
all-purpose flour, and 1/2 cup milk. If fudge is soupy, halve the
milk (to 1/4 cup). If fudge is as thin as bouillon, eliminate the
milk.

Mix egg, milk, and flour together until mixture is smooth, then stir
into fudge mixture. Bake in buttered 8x8-inch pan in preheated 325'F
oven for 40 to 45 minutes. A cake tester inserted around the edge
should come out clean; center will obviously still be soft. Place on
rack to cool.
