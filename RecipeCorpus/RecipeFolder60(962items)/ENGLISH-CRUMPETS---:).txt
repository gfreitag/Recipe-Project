Yield: 15 Approx

10 ml Dried yeast

English crumpets are delicious when spread hot with butter. The butter
soaks into the crumpet and drips down your chin as you bite them:)

Strong white flour is the type bakers use for bread dough. High in
gluten in makes a good risen batter or dough. In England we have
'Crumpet Rings' which are metal, about 3" in diameter. These are
placed into a fry pan and act as moulds while the crumpet cooks.
Crumpets can be anywhere between 2" and 5" in diameter.

Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.  Gently warm the milk to
just hand hot and sprinkle on the dried yeast. Leave to stand for 10
or 15 minutes until frothy. Add the yeast mix to flour and beat to a
smooth batter.  Cover with a damp cloth and leave to stand in a warm
place for 45 minutes, or the batter has doubled in size. Dissolve the
bicarb in 15ml of warm water and beat it into the batter.  Cover
again and leave to stand for a further 20 minutes.  Place a 3 inch
metal pastry cutter into a hot greased fry pan. Pour in about table
spoon of the batter to cover the base thinly. Cook until the top is
set and the bubbles have burst. Remove it from the ring, turn the
crumpet over and cook the other side for 2 or 3 minutes only. It
should just colour slightly. Cool on a wire rack. Eat them now, or
leave to go cold and toast them until brown on both sides. Spread
with lots of good butter and enjoy:) From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)
