False fish has no more to do with fish than Mock Goose with goose,
but it is a wondefully inventive dish that resembles fried fish
steaks.

Method: Boil the rice until cooked - about 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
cook the lentils, garlic and onion together in as little water as
possible. As soon as the rice and lentils are just cooked, drain
them, then stir them together adding the herbs and salt. Press the
mixture into a 2 pint (1.2 litre) pudding basin. Fit a Saucer into
the basin on top of the mixture, weight it down - a couple of tins
will do nicely - and leave it overnight. The following day, remove
the mixture and cut into slices. Coat the slices with egg, then
breadcrumbs and fry until golden. Serve with fresh vegetables and
parsley sauce.
