Title: EVERYDAY GARLIC CHICKEN
Categories: Chicken, Low-fat, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Whole chicken
2 ts Ground ginger
1    Lemon, pricked
24 cl Garlic, peeled
3 c  Chicken broth
1    Freshly ground pepper
Preheat the oven to 350. Wash the chicken and pat it dry inside and
out. Place the lemon in the cavity and place the chicken in a small
roasting pan. Cut one clove of garlic in half and rub over the breast
skin. Bake the chicken for 20 minutes; add 1 1/2 cups broth and bake
for another 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375, add the remaining
broth and garlic and cook for another 30 to 40 minutes, basting every
ten minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and place it on a
platter, breast side down to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the
collected juices into a fat-skimming cup and defat. With a fork, mash
the garlic. Place the garlic and defatted juices back in the roasting
pan. Over medium-high heat, reduce the juices by half, stirring
frequently. Strain if you desire a smoother sauce. Carve the chicken
and pass the sauce at the table.
