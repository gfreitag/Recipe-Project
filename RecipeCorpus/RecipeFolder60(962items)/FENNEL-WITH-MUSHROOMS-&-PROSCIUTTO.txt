Title: FENNEL WITH MUSHROOMS & PROSCIUTTO
Categories: Side, Vegetable
8    heads fennel -- as noted
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/4 c  chicken broth
3/4 c  white wine -- slightly
sweet
(such as Johannisberg
Riesling)
:
:
:
1 lb sliced mushrooms
2 oz prosciutto -- thinly sliced
and minced
:

Sauteed mushrooms and crisp prosciutto pieces peek out from tender
wine-poached fennel bulbs, garnish with fennel fronds. Prep and cook
time: About 1 hour and 20 minutes (1 hour and 30 minutes if prepared
ahead and chilled). You can steam the fennel, make the mushroom
filling, and stuff the bulbs 1 day ahead. *Fennel Note ~ about 6 1/2
pounds total, 8 fennel, each 3 inches wide at base.

1. Trim off fennel stalks and feathery greens. Reserve feathery
greens, mincing enough of them to make 1/4 cup. (If making ahead,
chill 2 tablespoons of the minced greens, as wellas the remaining
feathery sprigs to use to garnish platter when served.) Reserve
fennel stalks for use in soups or stocks. Trim any brown spots from
bulbs; arrange in a single layer in a 5- to 6-quart pan. Pour broth
andwine over them; cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then
simmer until fennel is very tender when pierced, 35 to 45 minutes.
Set aside until cool enough to handle: reserve cooking liquid.

2. While fennel cooks, combine mushrooms, prosciutto, and 2
tablespoons of the minced fennel greens in an 8- to 10-inch nonstick
frying pan. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until mushrooms
exude juice, about 7 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring often, until
liquid evaporates and mushrooms are browned, about 15 minutes; set
aside.

3. With a small knife and a sharp-edged spoon, scoop out inner part of
fennel bulbs so that you have a 1/4-inch-thick shell, keeping shell
intact. (Reserve scooped-out fennel for soups or other uses, if
desired.) Spoon mushroom mixture equally into bulbs. Arrange bulbs in
a baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer. Spoon
reserved cooking liquid over them. (If making ahead, cover and chill
up to 1 day.)

4. Bake stuffed fennel bulbs, covered, in a 375F/190C oven for 15
minutes; uncover and continue baking until hot, about 10 more minutes
(20 minutes if made ahead and chilled). Transfer bulbs to a serving
platter; sprinkle lightly with remaining minced fennel greens, and
garnish platter with fennel sprigs.
