Title: ENGLISH MUFFINS 4
Categories: Breads, Muffins
Yield: 20 Muffins
1 c  Hot water
1/2 c  Scalded milk
2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 pk Yeast
2 tb 85 deg water
4 c  All-purpose flour
3 tb Softened butter
Remove tops and bottoms from Tuna cans and clean thoroughly to make
good muffin rings.

Combine the water, milk, sugar and salt. Dissolve the yeast in the 85
deg water for 10 min. and add. Sift and beat in two cups of flour.
Cover bowl with a damp towel and let the sponge rise for about 1 1/2
hours or until the sponge collapses. Beat the butter in and knead in
the remaining flour. Let the dough rise again until it doubles. Punch
down and 1/2 fill the rings with dough. Let rise until doubled again.
Cook until browned on a med hot well buttered griddle, turning once.
Cool slightly on a rack and serve. They are best fresh and warm.

For whole wheat muffins replace 2 cups of white flour with brown and
use brown sugar not white. Raisins and cinnamon are a nice addition
to the dough. Submitted By WA6AWD@WOLFENET.COM (ALAN BURGSTAHLER) On
