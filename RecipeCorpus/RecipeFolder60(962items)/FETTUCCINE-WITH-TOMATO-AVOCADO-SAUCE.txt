Categories: Pasta, Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Olive oil
1 md Onion; finely chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1    Fresh hot chile pepper
-- seeded and minced
4 md Tomatoes
-- cut into 1/2-inch cubes
3/4 ts Fine sea salt

Heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the onion, garlic, and chile pepper, and cook until softened,
about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper and cook,

warmed serving bowl.

Add the tomato sauce, avocados, extra-virgin olive oil, and lime
juice. Toss to mix well, and serve immediately.
