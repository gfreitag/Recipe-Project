Title: EL TORITO SWEET CORN CAKE
Categories: Salad
1/4 c  butter or margarine
Yield: 12 Servings
2 TB shortening
1/2 c  masa harina
3 TB cold water
10 oz corn kernels

My favorite, and well worth the effort. Masa harina comes in a bag
like flour and can be found with the flour in most supermarkets. It's
the flour to use for corn tortillas. The recipe doubles easily and
turns out well with either of the two methods provided. -- Ann Weeks,
Corona Method two is the moist scoop we usually get at the
restaurant. -- patH Recipe By : El Torito Restaurant, California
