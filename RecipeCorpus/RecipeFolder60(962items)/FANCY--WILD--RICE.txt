Title: FANCY  WILD  RICE
Categories: Kaz
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pk Uncle Ben's long grain &
Wild rice
1    (8 oz.) pkg. fresh mushrooms
Sliced
1    Onion -- chopped
1 c  Pecans -- chopped
1 1/2    Sticks margarine
Prepare rice according to package directions.  Saute mushrooms,
onions and pecans in margarine until onions are transparent and
mushrooms are soft. Mix with wild rice once done. Toss and serve.

I sometimes add sauteed chicken strips or cubes to rice and serve as
a main dish.  This recipe is so simple but wonderful. Friends and
family will rave.
