Title: FALL FEAST - DINNER MENU PREPARATION SCHEDULE
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 1 Schedule
MMMMM-------------------------INFO ONLY------------------------------
Even the quickest dinners need a certain amount of organization! In
this case you'll have to cheat a little, making the meringue [Fall
Feast - Pavlova} a day or two ahead of time.

Keep it in a cool place, but not in the fridge, since refrigeration
makes the meringue sticky.

The remainder of the mean can be prepared in under one hour.

First dice the vegetables for the chowder and get the soup cooking.
Then dice the vegetables for the pork dish, saut the pork and
vegetables and place them in the oven, as directed.

While the meat cooks, prepare the homestyle potatoes.

Finish by garnishing the dessert.

The pork and the potatoes will be ready at the same time, so keep
them warm while you finish the sauce for the pork. The soup and
potatoes reheat well, but the pork is best served as soon as it is
cooked.

Drinks:

A cocktail to start the proceedings: Keglevish [sweetened lemon vodka]
mixed with cranberry juice and topped up with soda, or a glass of
semi-dry Riesling.

First course [soup]: Chardonnay, California Fetzer Sundial, Australian
Koonunga Hill, Sauvignon Blanc, or Belgian lambic beer.

Main Course [Pork]: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir - California Calera Central
Coast, or Burgundy - Latour Pinot Noir, or Beaujolais.

Dessert [Meringue]: Suaternes, Fontanafredda Asti

with coffee: Calvados VSOP - a French apple brandy.
