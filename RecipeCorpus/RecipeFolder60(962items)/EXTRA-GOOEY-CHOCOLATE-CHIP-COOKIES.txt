Title: EXTRA GOOEY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
Categories: Chocolate, Desserts
Yield: 36 Servings
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 c  Butter -- softened
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 cn Brown sugar, packed
2 ts Vanilla
2    Extra large eggs
24 oz Chocolate chips -- (2
Packages)
Preheat oven to 375F.  Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a
bowl, set aside. Cream together butter, granulated sugar, brown
sugar, and vanilla. Do not over beat mixture. Add eggs one at a time,
combining well after each addition.  Gradually stir in flour mixture.
Stir in chocolate chips, in 2 or 3 additions, mixing well. Drop by
rounded tablespoon onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for
approximately 10 minutes, until lightly browned and centers have just
set - they should look almost a bit underdone. Let stand for 10 to 15
minutes to cool before moving to wire racks to finish cooling.

Cookies will be more moist than from standard recipes, and will pull
apart easily when very warm.
