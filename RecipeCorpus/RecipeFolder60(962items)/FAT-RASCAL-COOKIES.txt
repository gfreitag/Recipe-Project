Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Flour
3/8 ts Baking powder
1 tb Sugar, dark brown
4 oz Butter
1/2 c  Currants
1 tb Milk
2 tb -Water
-Sugar for dusting on top
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Sift the flour and the baking powder.
Add a pinch of salt, mix in the brown sugar and rub in the butter.
Add the currants, milk and just enough water to make a soft dough.
Roll out the dough on a well-floured surface to approximately 1/2
inch thickness and using a glass, cut into 2 inch rounds. Dust each
circle with a little sugar and place on a well greased baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the rascals begin to turn golden. cool
on a rack before serving.

Note by A. MacLellan--This is an English recipe and because of the
difference in flour. I found it necessary to increase the amount of
liquid and reduce the heat to 375 degrees. I used quite a bit of
liquid and make a drop cookie. They take very much like the currant
biscuits that you can buy from Marks and Spencer at a high price.
