Sift flour into a bowl, add lard and mix until the mixture makes a
coarse meal. Add egg, egg white and 1/4 cup of cold water. Continue
mixing and adding the water until a firm dough is formed. Knead until
the dough is smooth, then wrap and chill for 15-30 minutes.
In a small skillet, heat butter; add onion and garlic, cook over
medium heat until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add
tomatoes, cardamon, cloves, pepper, and salt. Cook about 8 minutes.
Add palm and cook 5 minutes more, or until liquid has evaporated. Set
filling aside and let cool, or refigerate overnight, well covered.
Make sealer and glaze by mixing egg yolk and cold water together.
Set aside.
Preheat oven to 400 deg F. On a floured board, roll out dough 1/8"
thick and cut 4" squares. Knead scraps and reroll, repeat making
squares until all the dough is used. Put one tablespoon of the
filling into the center of each square, put shrimp on top, moisten
edges of dough with sealer and form a triangle. Press edges together
with a fork to seal.
Place empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush
with remaining glaze and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden.
Transfer to a rack to cool slightly, serve warm.
