Title: ENGLISH MUFFIN PIZZAS
Categories: Digest, Oct., Lacto
Yield: 1 Servings
x  English muffins
x  Fatfree spaghetti sauce
x  Kraft sharp ff cheese
Max's Healthy Roman Fat Free Pizza review prompted me to send along
this little quick lunch/dinner idea.  My (new) husband and I are
often very rushed for dinner and such, and also wanted pizza without
all the fat. So, we decided to try a new twist on an old favorite -
English muffin pizzas! All we did was heat up some fatfree spaghetti
sauce, toast english muffins, and cover with Kraft Free Sharp Cheddar
(not really sharp, just good) cheese and mushrooms and other fatfree
toppings. The sauce is usually enough to melt the cheese, but can
easily be nuked. At 1 gram of fat for an english muffin (2 sides),
you can't beat it! You also fill up really fast...
