flour, and beat until well blended. Let rise in warm place until it
has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Cream butter and sugar until very light.  Drain brandy from
currants.
Place sifted flour, salt, mace, and cinnamon in sifter. Add egg to
creamed mixture and beat until light. Stir in lemon rind and juice.
Add yeast mixture and beat thoroughly.  Add currants, retaining the
brandy for later. Sift in flour, add brandy, beat well. Place in tube
pan or 9x5 loaf pan that has been well greased. Cover with a cloth
and place in warm place away from draft.  Allow to rise until doubled
in bulk. This mixture rises very slowly and may take 4 to 6 hours to
double in bulk.
Bake at 375Ã¸F for about 45 minutes.  Cool in pan briefly. Turn
out on rack, allow to cool further. Then brush with lemon or orange
glaze (recipe to follow).
