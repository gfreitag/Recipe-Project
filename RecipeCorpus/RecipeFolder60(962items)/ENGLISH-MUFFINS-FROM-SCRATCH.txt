Title: ENGLISH MUFFINS FROM SCRATCH
Categories: Breads, Muffins
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Strong white flour
1/2 oz Fresh yeast or 1/2 t. dried
-yeast
1 tb Sugar
1/8 lb Butter, melted
1 tb Salt
8 oz Warm milk and water
(The 8 oz. milk and water refers to 8 fluid ounces, or 250 ml.) Sift
the flour and the salt into a bowl and leave it in a warm place.
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 UK pint (about 1/2 cup--rsc) of
the warm milk and water.  Leave to froth, then mix in the fat.  Stir
all the liquid into the warm flour and beat well until smooth and
elastic. Cover and prove in a warm place for 50 minutes or until
doubled in bulk. Turn onto a well-floured board and knead, working in
a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier to shape.
Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage-shape, and divide into
8 to 10 portions about 1 1/2 to 1-3/4 inches thick. Shape each one
into a round with straight sides. Put onto a greased baking sheet,
cover and put in a warm place to prove for 30-40 minutes or until
spongy to the touch. Leave plenty of room for expansion, and be
careful not to over-prove, as the muffins will lose their shape. Warm
and grease bakestone (or other griddle) lightly. Lift the muffins
carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very moderate heat for
8-10 minutes, until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook the other
side. Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches.  To serve,
insert a knife in the side; then with fingers pull the top and bottom
apart and insert thin slivers of butter.  (or tear in half with forks
and toast.)  If reheating from cold, toast the top and bottom, then
pull apart and butter. Source: Diane Duane, FidoNet Cooking Echo
