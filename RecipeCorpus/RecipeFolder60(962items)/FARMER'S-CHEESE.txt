Title: FARMER'S CHEESE
Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 Servings
5 qt Buttermilk; low-fat
Water
Cheesecloth strainer
Place the five quarts of buttermilk in a non corrosive pan; i.e.
enamel or stainless steel.  Pour water at least half way up the sides
of the containers (use cardboard ones; not glass bottles). Bring to a
boil and let it go for 20 minutes.  Turn of and wait until the water
is tepid. hang the cheesecloth strainer over the sink or over a large
pot. You will need help here. Pour each quart of 'cooked' buttermilk
into the strainer and let it hang at least 12 hours.  What you will
have left in the bag is a very dry cheese...similar to Farmer's
cheese.  Now my Stepmom sometimes adds a bit of sugar to the cheese.
If you put it in the FP and zap it with a some milk you have a creamy
spread; similar to cream cheese. We use this in Blintzas and in place
of ricotta in some recipes.
It would be wonderful if you need Farmer's cheese and can't get it.
