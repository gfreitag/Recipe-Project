Title: ENGLISH MUFFIN SANDWICH
Categories: Appetizers, Sandwiches
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------JUDI M. PHELPS----------------------------
1 c  Black olives; sliced
1 c  Cheddar cheese; shredded
1/2 c  Onion; chopped
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
Cayenne to taste
3    English muffins
Combine above ingredients with exception of muffins.

Split muffins in half and spread generously with mixture. Bake at 350
degrees F for 5-10 minutes until puffy and hot.

Marvelous for lunch with gazpacho and mixed green salad. Serves 6 for
an appetizer 3 for a luncheon dish.

Judi's Notes:  I have substituted 1/4 cup low-fat yogurt for the same
amount of mayonnaise and it has been just as successful as using the
whole amount of mayonnaise (saving some calories and still making a
tasty dish).
