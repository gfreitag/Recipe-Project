2 1/4 c  Water
3/4 c  Apple juice
1 ts Tamari

* To roast chestnuts: Choose fresh, firm, unwrinkled chestnuts with no
signs of mold. On the flat side of each chestnut make 2 cuts with a
small, sharp knife, from one end to the other in the shape of an X.
Place the chestnuts, cut side up, on a low baking sheet with a thin
layer of water on the bottom. Bake the chestnuts for 20-25 minutes at
350F until browned and the cuts peel back naturally from the heat.
Test one chestnut to be sure its "meat" is tender. When tender,
remove from oven, cool only slightly, peel and enjoy or use in
recipes. Some people like to boil the cut chestnuts for easier
peeling. This is okay, though some nutrients and flavour will be lost.

Prepare chestnuts. Peel off the outer shell and the fuzzy skin before
using the inner chestnut meat.

Heat the oil until hot and saute the onion until semi-tender. Add the
celery and saute until both are very tender. Blend the water and apple
juice with the chestnuts and all the remaining ingredients*. Simmer
everything on low to medium heat (do NOT boil!) for about 15-20
minutes or until hot throughout and the flavours mingle. Enjoy this
rich and tantalizing soup with extra chopped or ground nuts as a
garnish.

Keeps 4-6 days refrigerated.

*Two vegetable bouillon cubes may be used instead of the tamari or
miso. Also, 1/2 cup applesauce and 2 1/2 cups water can be used
instead of the juice and 2 1/4 cups water. *Anne's note: I would
assume by reading this, she means blend these ingredients in a
blender and return to the pot.
