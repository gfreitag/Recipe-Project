Title: FAITH'S CHUTNEY CHEESE SPREAD
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
8 oz Plain cream cheese -- room
Temperature
1 c  Chutney
Cream the chutney and cheese together by hand. Do not use a food
processor or blender otherwise you end up with cheese sauce.

Choice of chutney:  Pix uses her own green tomato chutney, which is a
spicy combination of tomatoes, onions, raisins, and walnuts. All and
any varieties of chutney work well. * * * Use the spread to stuff
snow or sugar snap peas, spread on cucumber or zucchini rounds,
sweetmeal biscuits, water biscuits, or slightly toasted miniature
bagels. The chutney spread makes a tasty sandwich when combined with
smoked turkey or Virginia ham or by itself on date and nut or
buckwheat walnut bread.
