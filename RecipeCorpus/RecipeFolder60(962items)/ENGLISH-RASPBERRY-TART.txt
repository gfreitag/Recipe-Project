3/4 c  Raspberry preserves --

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine flour and 2 tablespoons sugar

Sprinkle flour mixture with vinegar and water, 1 tablespoon at a
time, tossing with a fork to mix together lightly. Add enough water
to form a stiff dough. With floured fingers, press dough evenly over
bottom and up sides of 10 inch tart pan with removable bottom. Bake
8-12 minutes or until crust is set and lightly golden brown. Cool
slightly. Reduce oven to 350 degrees F. Spread 1/2 cup preserves
evenly over bottom of crust. In large bowl, mix 1/3 cup sugar and egg
yolks until well blended. Stir in almonds, breadcrumbs, butter and
almond extract. In small bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks
form. Gently fold whites into filling mixture. Pour into tart crust,
spreading to edges of crust to cover preserves. Bake 30-35 minutes or
until filling is puffed and golden brown. Cool 30-40 minutes. Remove
sides of pan. Place on serving plate. Spread 1/4 cup preserves over
top. Serve warm or cool.
