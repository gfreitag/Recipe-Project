Place the chiles on a cookie sheet, and roast in a 350 degree oven
until slightly toasted (when you can smell them, they're done).
Remove from the oven, and slit open. Remove the seeds and veins, then
cover the chiles with boiling water.  Allow to sit for about 30
minutes. remove the chiles from the water (reserve water), and scrape
the pulp from the chiles. Discard the skins (which can give the
mixture a bitter flavor.)

Return the chile pulp to the soaking water and reserve.

Saute the garlic and onion in the lard until very soft but not
browned. Stir in the flour, and the stock. Stir until thickened, then
add the chile pulp mixture. Add the spices, and simmer until
thickened. Place the mixture in a blender, and blend until smooth.
Season to taste with salt. If you want a hotter mixture, add cayenne
to taste.
