Title: FAKE ALMOND ROCA
Categories: Candies, Fake
Yield: 1 Pound
1 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Water
1 ts Light corn syrup
1 c  Fine chop toasted almonds
1 c  Milk-chocolate chips
Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the sugar, water, and corn syrup.
Cook the mixture over med. heat, stirring. When the sugar dissolves
and the mixture begins to boil, raise the heat and bring the mixture
to 290~F degrees on a cooking thermometer. This is called the
soft-crack stage. It will be light brown in color, and syrup will
separate into threads that are not brittle when dribbled into cold
water. Quickly stir in 1/2 cup chopped almonds.  Immediately pour the
mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet. Wait 2 or 3 minutes for the
candy surface to firm, then sprinkle on the chocolate chips. In a few
minutes, when the chips have softened, spread the chocolate evenly
over the surface. Sprinkle the remaining almonds over the melted
chocolate.  When the chocolate hardens, crack the candy into pieces.
Store covered. VARIATIONS: To get a candy more like the Heath bar or
Hersheys Skor, follow the same directions above except omit step 9.
