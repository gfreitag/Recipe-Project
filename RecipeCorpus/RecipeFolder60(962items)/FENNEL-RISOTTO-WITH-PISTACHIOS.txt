1 cup water
1 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Olive oil

1. Heat the broth-water combination over medium-low heat. Keep warm.
2. In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, or large pot, heat the
butter and oil over medium heat until hot. Add the onion, fennel and
red pepper; saute 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute an additional
minute. 3. Stir in the rice and cook, stirring 2 minutes. Slowly
start to add the liquid, about a ladleful at a time.  Cook, covered,
over medium-low heat, 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the
liquid slowly and stir often. Wait until the liquid has been absorbed
each time before adding the next ladleful. Repeat the cooking
process, covered, 10 minutes. 4. Uncover and continue adding the
liquid and stirring often. The risotto should cook about 30 minutes.
The finished risotto should be creamy, with a little chewiness at the
center of the rice. 5. Add the pistachios, pepper and Parmesan to the
finished risotto, stirring until blended.
