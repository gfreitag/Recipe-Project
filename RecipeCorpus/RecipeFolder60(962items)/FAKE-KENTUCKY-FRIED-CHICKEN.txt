Title: FAKE KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Chicken fryer parts
Seasoning Paste:
2 pk Italian Dressing mix**
3 tb Flour
2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Lemon juice (or vinegar)
2 tb Margarine or cooking oil
Coating Mix:
2 c  Milk, club soda or beer
Dry pancake mix
For Frying:
1 1/2 pt Cooking oil
**Note: Use the Good Seasoning brand Italian or Mild Italian Dressing
Mix right from the package.

Begin with about 3 lbs fryer parts. Cut the breast pieces in half.
Fries much quicker when pieces are small.

Combine Seasoning Paste ingredients (dressing mix, flour, salt, lemon
or vinegar, and margarine or oil) . Spread this paste evenly over
chicken pieces. Stack in a bowl; cover and refrigerate at least two
hours or better yet, overnight. About 1 hour before serving, heat
about 1 1/2 pints cooking oil in a heavy saucepan ( 9 inches in
diameter,with the depth of oil of about 3 inches) to a temperature of
425 degrees.

I prefer my Oster Super Cooker, but using an electric deep fryer I
would have the temperature at about 400 degrees. Put about 2 cups
milk or club soda or beer in a deep, narrow bowl & dip each piece
chicken in the liquid, letter the excess drip off. Dust lightly but
evenly in Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour ( or a good brand ).DO NOT
OVERCOAT!!! Dry pieces a few minutes without letting them touch each
other. Fry a few pieces at a time. Place on a cookie sheet without
letting them touch each other and bake at 350F uncovered for 30
minutes. Serves 6-8 persons.

I encourage you to experiment with amount of salad dressing mix
according to your own taste preferences, but much of it washes off in
the milk so 2 packages are at least needed.
