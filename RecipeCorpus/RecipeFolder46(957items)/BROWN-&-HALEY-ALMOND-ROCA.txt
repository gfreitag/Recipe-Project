1 c  -- Â¥
2    Sticks butter
1 c  Granulated sugar
3 tb Water
1 ts Light corn syrup
1 c  Toasted almonds -- chop

1 c  Milk chocolate chips
Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the sugar, water and corn
syrup. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring. When the sugar
dissolves and the mixture begins to boil, raise the heat and bring
the mixture to 290 on a cooking thermometer. It will be light brown
in color and syrup will separate into threads that are not brittle
when dribbled into cold water. Quickly stir in 1/2 cup chopped
almonds. Immediately pour the mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Wait 2-3 minutes for the candy surface to firm,, then sprinkle onthe
chocolate chips. IN a few minutes, when the chips have softened,
spread the chocolate evenly over the surface. Sprinkle the remaining
almonds over the melted chocolated.When the chocolate hardens, crack
the candy into pieces, store covered. NOTE: Heath bar or hersheys.
These two candy bars are very similar, and both are composed of
ingredients similar to those in ALmond roca. One obvious difference
is that thre are no almonds on top of these bars. To make these candy
bars, simply follow the directions for almond roca butomit the nuts.
