Categories: Buckwheat, Information
Yield: 1 Servings  Eating buckwheat may postpone your hunger pangs. According to USDA
study and other research, buckwheat will keep glucose levels in check
better than other carbohydrates.

Buckwheat gives you over 20% more fiber than oatmeal. The total
dietary fiber content of buckwheat is largely soluble fiber. This is
the type of fiber that many nutritionists and medical experts believe
to be significant in helping to lower cholesterol levels when
combined with a low fat diet.

Buckwheat is one of the best plant sources of protein. If you're
eating less meat, this can be especially important. Eggs are the
standard used to size up protein quality. Buckwheat as over 80% of
the protein quality of eggs--with none of the cholesterol or fat.
Plus, buckwheat is rich in lysine, one of the amino acids that is in
short supply in most grains.

Buckwheat is a fruit, not a grain. As such, it's wheat-free and
gluten-free.  This is healthful news for those with celiac disease and
other less severe wheat allergies.
