Title: BUTTERMILK BREAD IN A PRESSURE COOKER
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Egg
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Soda
1 ts Baking powder
1 c  Buttermilk (I don't have the
-recipe at hand, but you can
-make
Quite adequate buttermile
-from dried milk)
1 c  Nut, dates and/or raisins
4 c  Water in pressure cooker
-with rack.
Combine egg and sugar.  Sift flour, soda and baking powder. Add
buttermilk anternately with sifted dry ingredients. Mix well. Add
nuts and stuff. Turn into buttered bowl and cover with wax paper.
Place bowl in cooker on rack with water.  Place cover on cooker.
Steam without pressure weight for 15 minutes, then cook at cook
position for 25 minutes, allow to cool naturally.

Works, and makes quite tasty bread.  I've also got a really good
receipe for making brown bread and boston brown bread in a pressure
cooker.

After a week at sea, we (a crew of four) could polish off a whole
loaf at one sitting, especially if the butter was still firm.
