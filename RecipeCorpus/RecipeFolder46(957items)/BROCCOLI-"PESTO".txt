Title: BROCCOLI "PESTO"
Categories: Pasta, Sauces and, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Broccoli Florets
1/4 c  To 1/2 Cup Olive Oil
1/4 c  Parmesan Cheese
8    Sundried Tomatoes -- * see
Note
1    Handful Unsalted Cashews
1 sm Bulb Garlic
* plus about 2T of Trader Joe Sundried Tomato Seasoning (dried tomato
and spices)

Steam broccoli and allow to cool.  In blender or food processor,
puree cool broccoli, olive oil, garlic, and cashews. Add oil as
necessary. Remove to bowl, and stir in parmesan cheese and chopped
sundried tomato. Serve over hot pasta.  (I served Sundried
Tomato/Basil Tortelloni purchased from Trader Joe)

There it is...eat/try at your own risk.  I thought it was fine, but
proportions may need to be changed to thin it down a bit next time.
And (shudder) an entire bulb of garlic may have been too much, it was
actually hot/spicy from the garlic.
