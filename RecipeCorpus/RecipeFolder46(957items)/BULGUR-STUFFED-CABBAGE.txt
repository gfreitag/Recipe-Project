Title: BULGUR STUFFED CABBAGE
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Head green cabbage
1 c  Finely chopped parsley
2    Onions, chopped
4    Celery stalks, chopped
1/4 ts Italian seasoning
1/2 ts Minced garlic
2    15-oz cans tomato sauce
4 c  Water
2 c  Dry bulgur
1    8-oz can tomato sauce
1/2 c  Water
Remove core from cabbage, place cabbage head in steamer and steam
until all leaves are soft and separate easily. Saute parsley, onions,
celery, seasoning, and garlic in oil substitute until onions are
soft. Add 2 15-oz. cans of tomato sauce, 4 cups water and bulgur.
Cook about 1/2 hr. over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until
bulgur is tender. Remove from heat. To stuff cabbage leaves, place a
spoonful of mixture in center of each leaf. Starting at one side,
roll leaf up and fold ends under. Place in a deep baking pan. Mix the
8 oz can of tomato sauce with 1/2 cup water and pour over stuffed
cabbage leaves so they remain moist during baking. Bake at 375 for
about 30 min. until cabbage is hot.
