Title: BUBBE'S KISHKA
Categories: Side dish, Jewish, Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
-GRAMMIE'S KITCHEN
1    Kishka
4 c  Flour
3/4 lb Suet; ground beef fat
4 ts Salt
2 ts Pepper
2 lg Carrot; grated
2    Onions; grated
2    Celery; grated
Combine fat and flour. Blend well. Add vegetables, salt, and pepper.
Knead well. Stuff kishka loosely, like a turkey, only 3/4 inch thick.
(Flatten it.) Lay stuffed kishka around in a roasting pan. Add cold
salted water to cover. Cover pan and simmer on top of stove about 1
hour. Slice and serve hot.

MY NOTE: My Bubbe used to make this all the time. When she didn't have
kishka, she used the loose skin from the turkey or chicken. We called
it helzel. She stuffed that after she sewed into a tube. It was soooo
good.
