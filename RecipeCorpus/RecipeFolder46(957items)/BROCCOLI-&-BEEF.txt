Title: BROCCOLI & BEEF
Categories: Ethnic:, Chinese
1/2 lb lean beef (preferably flank
steak)
Yield: 4 Servings
:
1 TB soy sauce
1 TB rice wine or sherry
1 TB cornstarch
1    green onion -- cut into 1"
pieces
:
1 ts fresh ginger -- chopped
COOKING SAUCE:
:
1/2 c  chicken broth
2 TB soy sauce
2 TB oyster sauce
1/2 TB rice wine or sherry
2 ts cornstarch
2 ts sugar
few drops sesame oil
pn pepper
VEGETABLES:
:
:
:
2 c  broccoli flowerets
1 c  canned mushrooms (straw or
button) -- drained
:
1    carrot -- sliced

1.  Cut the beef across the grain into thin slices. Marinate in the
soy sauce, rice wine, and cornstarch. Set aside. 2. Cut up the green
onion and ginger. 3. Mix all the ingredients for the cooking sauce.
4. Blanch the broccoli and carrot slices in boiling water with a
pinch of salt until slightly soft, but still crunchy. Drain and set
aside. I usually do this step in the microwave. 5. Heat a wok over
high heat. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons oil.  Fry the green onion and
ginger until fragrant, then add the marinaded beef.  Stir fry quickly
until the meat changes color. 6. Pour in the cooking sauce and heat
until thickened and bubbly. 7. Mix in the vegetables. 8. Serve over
rice. Note: As with all Chinese cooking, it is very important to have
a strong heat

source.  Have your stove on the highest setting, or if possible, cook
in your backyard on a propane gas stove. This takes care of the
problem of odors and smoke in your kitchen also.
