Title: BUBBIE'S DAIRY NOODLE KUGEL
Categories: Ethnic, Pasta
Yield: 10 Servings
16 oz Noodle; cooked package/fine
6    Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar; to taste
1    Margarine; melted
1 c  Sour cream
1 c  Cottage cheese
Salt; to taste
1/2 c  Raisins ; optional golden
Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, drain
well. Add the other ingredients and mix until combined. Put into a 9
x 13 baking dish (greased) and bake at 350 degrees for an hour. Never
fails.

You can serve with fruit (fresh) or put pie filling over it. Try
putting some sour cream on top. Enjoy You can incorperate the egg
yolks and beat the whites for a very light texture. I sometimes add a
bit of lemon juice.

This is a very forgiving recipe. If you leave the sour cream, sugar
and raisins out, you have a wonderful salt kugel to serve with
chicken or beef.
