Title: BROCCOLI & NAVY BEAN STEW
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Buckwheat spaghetti, cooked
1/2 ts Red wine vinegar
x  Brocolli
x  Onions
x  Navy beans (canned)
1/2 ts Rosemary
x  Raw diced tomato
Cook some buckwheat spaghetti, and save the water. Heat some water
with about 1/2 t. of red wine vinegar, and saute some broccoli and
onions (cut up, of course). When near-tender, add some cooked navy
beans (I happened to have a can of Eden brand) and the drained
spaghetti. If there isn't enough liquid, use a little of the
spaghetti water. Also include a little rosemary (1/2 t. approx.) Cook
a little longer. Serve with some raw diced tomato on top.
