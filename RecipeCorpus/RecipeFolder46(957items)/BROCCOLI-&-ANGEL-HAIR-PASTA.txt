Cut broccoli into small pieces. Chop elephant head garlic into small

crisp. While broccoli is cooking, cook angel hair pasta until
slightly firm. Drain. Melt the stick of butter in the pan you cooked
angel hair in. Add angel hair back to pan and toss to coat pasta. Add
broccoli and toss lightly. Pour some olive oil in a small frying pan.
Add chopped garlic and some crushed red pepper. Brown garlic. Garlic
will clump together when done. Pour over pasta and broccoli. Sprinkle
