:

1 ts cumin seeds

"Wash beans and soak overnight in water 2"  above beans. Cook in same
water until done; do not drain. Add tomatoes and simmer for 5
minutes. Saute green peppers in salad oil for 5 minutes. Add onions
and cook until tender, stirring often.  Add garlic and cilantro. Melt
butter in large skillet and saute meat for 15 minutes. Add meat to
onion mixture and stir in chili powder.  Cook 10 minutes.  Add this
to beans and the spices. Simmer covered for one hour; cook uncovered
for 30 minutes. Place beer near chili pot and call me."    Note:
Marvin's original recipe called for 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes, but
that was really, really too hot. Also, I replaced the parsley
originally called for in the recipe with cilantro and added an extra
garlic clove. Lean beef can be substituted for venison. NOTES
: This is my brother-in-law, Marvin's recipe. It was published in
Southern Living!
