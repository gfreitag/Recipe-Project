Fresh rainbow trout - cleaned; head and tail left on. Stuffed with a
mixture of fresh rosemary, thyme, parsley, and sage loosely chopped
and blended with a little butter. Wrap the fish in a long rasher of
bacon. Enclose in foil and bake in a hot oven for around 25-30
minutes. Open top of foil and shape like a boat, paint with a little
butter and serve with boiled potatoes and plain fresh vegetables.
This dish used to be baked in an open fire with the fish encased in
mud.
