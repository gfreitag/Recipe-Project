Turn oven to 350 degrees.  In a large mixer bowl beat butter or
margarine with electric mixer on medium speed till softened (about 30
seconds). Add sugar and beat till mixture is fluffy. Add egg and
vanilla.  Beat well. In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour,
cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  With mixer on
low speed gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating till
well mixed. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place about 2 inches apart
on ungreased cookie sheets.  Press down center of each ball with your
thumb. Drain cherries, reserving juice.  Place a cherry in the center
of each cookie. For frosting, in a small saucepan combine chocolate
and condensed milk. Cook and stir over low heat till chocolate is
melted.  Stir in a 4 teaspoons reserved cherry juice.  Spoon 1
teaspoon frosting over each cherry, spreading to cover cherry.
(Frosting may be thinned with additional cherry juice if necessary).
Bake in the 350 degree oven about 10 minutes or till edges are firm.
With a pancake turner lift cookies onto a cooling rack to cool.
Makes about 48 cookies. Pam says that she doubles the cookie recipe
and uses the frosting as is.
