add the beef to the hot oil. Over high heat, brown the beef until
each piece is a rich, dark brown color.  Spoon the tomato paste over
the browned beef pieces, stirring to incorporate. Continue cooking
until the tomato paste starts to caramelize.  Deglaze the pan with
the burgundy wine.

In a large stock pot, 8 quarts, combine the beef, vegetables, browning
sauce and seasonings.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer,
covered for two hours. Thicken stew with the roux to the desired
consistency.

Adjust salt and pepper to taste.

broth plus 8 beef bouillon cubes  or  b) 2 quarts water, plus 24 beef
bouillon cubes
