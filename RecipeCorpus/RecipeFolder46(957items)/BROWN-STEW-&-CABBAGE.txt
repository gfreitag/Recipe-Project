COMMENTS: The combination of vegetables makes plain stew
extraordinary. Put stew in a Dutch oven with thyme and bayleaf. Bring
to a boil. Add potatoes, reduce heat, cover and cook gently 30
minutes. Add cabbage, salt and pepper, cover and simmer 10 minutes.
Taste stew and adjust seasoning. Stir cornstarch with water until
smooth. Bring stew to boil, push meat and vegetables to one side as
much as possible and gradually stir cornstarch mixture into liquid.
Stir until boiling, slightly thicken and clear. Serve immediately
sprinkled with parsely.
