3    Poblano peppers; fresh

30 oz Rotel tomatoes; diced (3 can
4 1/2 tb New mexico chile powder

Recipe by: Wayne Preston Allen I found the bison at a health food
store - that's a good bet for you, too. The New Mexico chili powder
might be had from one of a number of mail-order resources if you
don't have a local source. The Rotel tomatoes are hot, so you can
substitute reqular tomatoes to cool it a little (but it's gonna be
hot anyway!)

Brown the bison meat. Bison is lean and clumpy, so add a little oil
and break it up as you brown it. Add finely chopped onions and
garlic. When onions are clear, add tomatoes and spices. Add water to
barely cover, and simmer until meat is tender. Add chopped poblanos
for last 20 minutes of simmer, and stir in lime juice before serving.
You're really gonna be surprised!
