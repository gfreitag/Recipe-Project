-JUDI M. PHELPS (G.PHELPS1)
5 lg Tomatoes; peeled, seeded,
-and chopped
1 c  Bermuda onion; chopped
3    Hot peppers such as jalapeno
-seeded and minced*
1/4 c  Orange juice; freshly
-squeezed if possible
1    Lime (juice of)
2 tb Fresh basil; chopped
Salt; optional
2 lb Fresh tuna-about 1-in thick
1/2 c  Olive oil
1    Lemon (juice of)
Ground black pepper
*Use 1-1/2 to 2 peppers if a milder flavor salsa is desired.

SALSA:  Mix together the tomatoes, onions, peppers, orange juice,
lime juice, corander, and salt to taste in a large bowl. Press down
slightly on the mixture to extract some of the tomato juices. Cover
the bowl with plastic wrap, and set aside for at least 1 hour to
allow the flavors a chance to meld.

TUNA:  Preheat the broiler.  Marinate fish in a mixture of about 2/3
oil to 1/3 lemon juice for a few minutes before broiling. Drain the
fish, reserving the marinade. Broil the fish for about 5 minutes on
each side--or until cooked through, basting occasionally with the
reserved marinade. Serve with the salsa and a plate of cornbread.

VARIATION:  Substitue swordfish for tuna and replace basil with
coriander. SOURCE:  The Legal Seafoods Cookbook
