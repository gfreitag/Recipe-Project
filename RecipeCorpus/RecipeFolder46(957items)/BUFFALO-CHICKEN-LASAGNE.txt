This delicious lasagne is especially quick, because you don't need to
cook the lasagne before assembling!

Spray a large skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat
until hot. Add chicken; saute 4 minutes. Drain well. Stir in
spaghetti sauce, water, hot sauce, vinegar and garlic salt.

In a small bowl, combine ricotta cheese and egg substitute. Set aside.
Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Spread 1 cup of the
sauce over the bottom of the pan. Arrange 4 pieces of lasagne (3
lengthwise, 1 widthwise) over the sauce. Cover with 1 1/2 cups of the
sauce. Spread half the ricotta mixture on top. Arrange another 4
pieces of lasagne over ricotta, and top with another 1 1/2 cups of
sauce. Spread remaining ricotta mixture on top. Arrange final 4
pieces of lasagne over ricotta mixture and cover with remaining sauce.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cover lasagne with foil and bake for 1
hour 10 minutes. Uncover lasagne, sprinkle blue cheese on top and
bake an additional 5 minutes uncovered. Cover and let stand 15
minutes before serving.
