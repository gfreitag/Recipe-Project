pepper and onion. Blend together the catsup, mayonnaise and prepared
mustard and the spices (blend them together in a small cup or bowl).
Add the mixture to the cheese mixture and set aside. Set the oven to
broil and split the buns (if not already split) with a sharp knife.
Set the buns on the broiler rack, cut sides up, and broil with the
buns 2 inches from the heat source until golden brown.  Remove the
buns from the oven and spread with butter. Spread about 1/8 of the
cheddar mixture on a buttered side of each bun and return to the
broiler with the tops of the sandwiches 3-inches from the heat source.
Broil until the cheddar is bubbly and serve right from the oven.
