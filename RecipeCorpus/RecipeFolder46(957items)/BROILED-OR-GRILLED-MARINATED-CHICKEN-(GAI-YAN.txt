A street and market food served everywhere in Thailand, this chicken
is traditionally associated with the Northeast. At the train stations
or bus stop, you can get a few skewers and a little bag of sticky
rice for a delicious snack or light lunch. The marinade dates back to
a time before the introduction of chilies by the Portuguese. Black
peppercorns were used in enormous quantities, and they still have an
important role in Thai cooking.

Combine cilantro root, fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, pepper and
garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth and pour
into a shallow, non aluminum dish. Add chicken and turn to coat
evenly with marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at
least 1 hour or up to 8 hours, turning occasionally.

Preheat the broiler or prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Drain the
chicken and reserve the marinade for basting. Broil or grill the
chicken on a lightly oiled rack approximately 3 inches from the heat
for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken and baste with the reserved
marinade. Discard any leftover marinade. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes
longer, or until the outside is browned and the inside is no longer
pink.
