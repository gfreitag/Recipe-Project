Title: BRUSSELS WAFFLES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/8 ts Salt
1    Bottle beer
1/4 c  Oil
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 tb Grated lemon peel
1/2 ts Lemon juice
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
These waffles are a crisp type and are often served for dessert
topped with sweetened whipped cream and strawberries. They became
famous at the Belgian pavilion at the 1962 New York World's Fair.

Mix flour and salt. Add remaining ingredients. Beat just until
smooth. Let batter sit 2 hours at room temperature or refrigerate
overnight. This makes the waffles more tender. Bake in a waffle iron
following manufacturer's directions. Spread the batter thin and bake
until crisp and browned. Serve for dessert or breakfast. Yield
depends on size of waffle iron. For example, one that makes 7-inch
rounds will yield 4 large rounds that separate into 16 sections.
