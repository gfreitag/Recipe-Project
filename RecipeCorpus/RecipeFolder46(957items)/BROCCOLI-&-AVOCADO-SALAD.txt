Categories: Salads

1 lg Ripe avocado
1/2    Lemon
1 ts Dijon style mustard
1/2 ts Finely chopped garlic

Cut the broccoli into florets. If the pieces are large, cut the stems
in half. Rinse and drain them. Reserve the stems for another use. Drop
broccoli into boiling salted water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook
2 minutes. Drain and run the broccoli briefly under cold water to
cool. Drain again and chill. Cut the avocado in half. Peel each half
and remove the pit. Cut each half into 8 lengthwise strips. Squeeze
the lemon half over the strips to prevent discoloration. Arrange the
broccoli and the avocado alternately on each of 4 serving plates.
Blend the mustard, garlic, vinegar, pepper and oil, adding salt if
needed, in a bowl with a wire whisk. Pour over the broccoli and
avocado. Serve immediately.
