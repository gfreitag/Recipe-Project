Title: BROWN RICE INFORMATION
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 3 Cups  Natural Brown Rice ================== Brown rice is the whole grain
which retains a natural coating of bran. This rice bran can be an
important weapon in the fight against cholesterol.  Research has
shown rice bran to be effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels.

Brown rice contains 10% rice bran.  In addition to lowering
cholesterol, the rice bran layer gives the rice a light tan color, a
subtle, nut-like flavor and an interesting chewy texture. Brown rice
provides slightly more fiber, Vitamin E, protein, phosphorus,
riboflavin, and calcium than white rice.  However, most white rice is
enriched and therefore provides more thiamin and iron.

The key to a healthy diet is eating a variety of foods... and avoiding
foods that are high in fat, sugar, and sodium. Consume half your
calories ~- if not more -- from foods that are high in complex
carbohydrates, such as grains (like rice), fruits, and vegetables.
After all, fats are fattening.  One gram of fat has 9 calories but
one gram of carbohydrate has only 4.
