Title: BUTTERMILK CHEESE & BACON BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Buttermilk
2 tb Butter
2    Eggs
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 tb Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
3 c  Bread flour
2 1/2 ts Yeast (1 pkg Red Star)
Add at Mix Bread beep:
2/3 c  Bacon bits (real bacon,
-cooked then chopped, not
-canned or artificial)
2/3 c  Shredded cheese
This recipe is a combination of Donna Gorman's Bacon/Cheese Bread and
her Buttermilk Cheese Bread (cookbook III). I'd made the bacon/cheese
bread and it was good, but it was a rather dense, low loaf. When I
saw the buttermilk cheese bread recipe, I decided to make a few
modifications and combine the two recipes ... the result is a tall,
utterly delicious loaf!

I then tried it closer to her recipe and, instead of adding
bacon/cheese at the mix bread cycle, I added 1 cup of shredded cheese
at the beginning. This loaf almost brushed the top of my Hitachi! It
was HUGE!

I don't know why these rise so well ... I did warm the buttermilk in
the microwave for about 1/2 minute and the baking soda is unusual. I
may try adding a small amount of baking soda to some other recipes
and see what the result is.

Anyway ... this is now one of our favorite breads!  A loaf is baking
right now.
