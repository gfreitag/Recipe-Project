Title: BUTTERFINGER CASHEW CRUNCH ICE CREAM
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 -1/2 quart
2 c  Heavy Whipping Cream
2 c  Milk (I used the 1% stuff
-that was on sale)
2 tb Cold water
3 ea Rennet tablets
1 c  Sugar
4 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Cashew nuts (broken ones are
-fine)
6 ea Trick-or-treat size
-Butterfinger candy bars
3/4 c  French Toast Crunch
-breakfast cereal
Dissolve rennet tablets in water (swirl the bowl until dissolved), set
aside.  Combine cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla in saucepan and heat
stirring constantly to 110 degrees.  Pour into the ice cream freezer
machine, then add the rennet tablet solution and operate the churn
for five or ten seconds to mix well.  Turn off the churn and let that
cool for a while.

Take the butterfinger bars (still in their wrappers) and bludgeon
them with the flat handle of a knife (I used a heavy-handled bread
knife) to crush the contents well.  Open the wrappers and dump/scrape
the crushed contents into your food processor (with metal blade). Add
the cashews and the breakfast cereal, and pulse the food processor
until the dry ingredients are just broken up and well mixed.

By now the custard should be set and cooled off somewhat.  Turn on
the ice cream maker's refrigeration switch and, after a few minutes,
the churn. When the ice cream mixture is just starting to freeze,
pour in the crushed dry ingredients and continue to freeze to the
desired consistency. This will vary depending on your freezer, but
for me it takes about 25-35 minutes.

This is a really scrumptious combination, and could be varied by
changing the flavoring ingredients with other stuff you have around.
