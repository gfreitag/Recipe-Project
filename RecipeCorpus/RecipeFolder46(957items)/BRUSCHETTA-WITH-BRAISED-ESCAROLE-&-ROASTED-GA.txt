Categories: Appetizers, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Whole heads garlic
2 ts Olive oil; plus
1 tb Olive oil
--(preferably extra-virgin)
1 1/2 lb Escarole; trimmed,
-- cut into 1-inch pieces
1 lg Garlic clove; minced
4 sl French bread (4" x 6" each)
-- halved, toasted
1    Lemon; cut into 8 wedges
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cut 1/2 inch off top end (opposite root end)
of each garlic head, exposing top of garlic cloves. Remove any loose
papery outer skin. Place garlic cut side up in small glass baking
dish. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil.  Cover dish with foil and roast
garlic 30 minutes. Turn garlic cut side down. Roast uncovered until
tender, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature.

Separate garlic into individual cloves.  Pinch each clove at root end
to release garlic into small bowl. Mash with fork. Stir in 1 teaspoon
oil. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.
Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Cook escarole in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender,
about 4 minutes.  Drain well.  Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in
heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 minced garlic clove;
saute until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and
pepper.

Spread roasted garlic puree on bread slices.  Using tongs, place
escarole atop garlic.  Serve with lemon wedges.
