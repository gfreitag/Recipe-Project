Title: BROWNES BISTRO BREAD & BUTTER PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
1    Vanilla pod,
***OR***
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 sm Loaf stale French stick
4 tb Softened butter for spread
1/2 c  Raisins (plumped in water)
Finely grated zest of
1 lemon **OR** 1 orange
1/4 c  Sugar
4    Whole eggs
4    Egg yolks
1 oz Dark rum
2 tb Sugar, for sprinkling
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine milk, cream and vanilla.
Slowly bring almost to the boiling point, remove from heat and let
stand 30 minutes. Remove and discard vanilla pod before serving. Cut
the bread into thick (1/2 inch) slices, removing the crusts if
desired. Spread each slice thinly with butter and cut into quarters
(or halves if slices are very small). In a large buttered baking dish
(casserole or souffle), arrange one-third of the buttered bread in a
layer on the bottom. Sprinkle a half each of the raisins, lemon or
orange zest and sugar evenly on top. Arrange another one-third of the
bread on top, sprinkle with remaining raisins, zest and sugar.
Arrange the remaining bread, buttered side up, on top. In a bowl,
lightly beat the eggs and yolks with the milk, cream and rum. Pour
this mixture into a spouted jug, for easier pouring. Pour the egg
mixture down into the side of the baking dish. Avoid getting the top
layer wet or it won't crisp up. (Depending on the volume of the dish,
you may not use all the mixture, or you may need to add a little milk
so the liquid comes up almost to the top layer. Sprinkle sugar on
top. Place the baking dish in a large roasting pan containing a
shallow layer of boiling water. Place in a 350F oven and bake for
about 30 to 40 minutes, until the custard is set and the top is brown
and crusty. Serve hot from the dish accompanied by creme anglaise.
