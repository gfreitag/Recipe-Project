Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
Place the broiler rack in the middle position and preheat the
broiler.
Dip each steak in melted butter, coating both sides. Sprinkle one
side of each steak with 3/4 teaspoon of the seasoning mix and place
seasoned side down on a broiler-proof pan. Season the other side of
each steak with 3/4 teaspoon seasoning mix.  Broil until the tops are
browned but not burned, about 4 minutes.
Serve immediately.
