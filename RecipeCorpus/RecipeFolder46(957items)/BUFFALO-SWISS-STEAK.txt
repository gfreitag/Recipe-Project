Categories: Game

2    Buffalo steak; 1-1/2 to
-2 inches thick
2 oz Seasoned flour
Oil
1/2 pt Water or tomato juice

Less tender steaks or chops may need longer, slower cooking and may be
prepared as Swiss Steaks.

Into each side of the steaks pound as much seasoned flour as possible.
Brown on both sides in the hot fat, then add the tomato juice, or
water (enough to cover the meat). Simmer for 1-1/2 to two hours, or
until the steaks are tender.
