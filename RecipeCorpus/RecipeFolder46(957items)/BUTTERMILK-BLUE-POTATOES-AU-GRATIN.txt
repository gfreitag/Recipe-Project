Arrange half of the potatoes in the bottom of a buttered 2 1/2-quart
shallow casserole dish.  Make the buttermilk-blue cheese sauce as
follows: melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add garlic
and shallots and saute for 1 minute.  Add flour, stir, and cook for 3
minutes more. Pour in milk and buttermilk all at once. Cook, stirring
constantly, until sauce thickens and bubbles.  Remove from heat and
stir in white pepper, mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire, parsley
and half of the blue cheese. Layer all the mushrooms over the
potatoes in the casserole; top with half of the sauce and distribute
the grated jack cheese over the sauce. Layer remaining potatoes over
cheese and spoon remaining sauce on top. Sprinkle with remaining blue
cheese. Bake at 350F for 45 minutes. Sprinkle potato chips over top
and bake an additional 10 minutes. Meanwhile, blanch the broccoli.
Arrange broccoli around outer edges of casserole and garnish with
pimento; bake 5 minutes longer.
