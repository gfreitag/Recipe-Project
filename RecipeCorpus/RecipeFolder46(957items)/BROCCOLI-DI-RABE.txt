Judi's Notes:  This recipe was not tested by me, but I think to
improve the flavor of the dish a little more (and you can experiment
to see which way you prefer) I would heat the olive oil first and
saute the garlic in it for a few seconds, then add the broccoli rabe
and flavor it in the oil for a minute or two to coat.  Add the
seasonings and lemon juice. Then add about 1 cup of water and bring
to boil. Lower heat and continue with the rest of the recipe.  Just
dumping all the ingredients in and boiling will cook the vegetable,
however, I think sauteing it first will make it even more palatable.
It is my opinion that 1 cup of water will be enough, but you can add
the full amount called for if you think it is needed.
