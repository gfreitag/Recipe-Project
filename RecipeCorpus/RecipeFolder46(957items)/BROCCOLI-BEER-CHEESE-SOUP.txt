Bring water and onion to a boil in a large soup pot. Add seasonings
and half of the broccoli.  Bring to a boil again. Add soup base and
lower heat. In a separate saucepan, make a roux. When the roux
thickens, gradually stir into the soup, whipping with a wire whisk to
avoid lumps. Heat milk and cheese to just below boiling point until
the cheese melts, stirring constantly.  Blend into the soup and add
the remaining broccoli. Just before serving, add beer. Mix well.
