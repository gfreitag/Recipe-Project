Title: BUTTERMILK POUND CAKE (EW)
Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 16 Servings
2 cn (16 oz) pear halves in light
-syrup, drained
2 tb Butter
2 tb Vegetable oil, preferably
-canola oil
3 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 3/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Buttermilk
1 tb Pure vanilla extract
1 tb Grated lemon zest
2    Large eggs, separated
2    Large egg whites
In a food processor or blender, puree pears.  Transfer to a
medium-sized saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring almost
constantly, until reduced to 1 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. (Adjust heat as
necessary to maintain a gentle simmer).  Transfer to a large bowl and
let cool completely.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 10-inch tube pan or coat
with nonstick cooking spray.  Dust with flour, shaking out excess.

In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling the
pan, until the butter turns a light, nutty brown, about 60 seconds.
Pour into a small bowl, stir in oil and set aside.

Sift cake flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a
medium-sized bowl and set aside.  Add 1 1/2 cups of the suger,
buttermilk, vanilla, lemon zest, egg yolks and the butter-oil mixture
to the reserved pear puree and whisk until smooth.

In a clean mixing bowl and with clean beaters, beat the 4 egg whites
until soft peaks form.  While continuing to beat, slowly add the
remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff, but not dry, peaks form.

With a rubber spatula, gently fold the dry ingredients into the pear
puree mixture alternately with the beaten whites, making three
additions of the dry ingredients and two additions of the beaten
whites. Turn the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake for 40 to 45
minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out
clean. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to
cool, right side up.
