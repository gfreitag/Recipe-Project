yeast and salt into work bowl. Process on/off 3 or 4 times to blend.

Process until mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Add egg and process
until blended,

until flour is blended in, about 15 seconds. Gradually add just
enough of the remaining flour to make a soft and pliable dough that

minutes in pan.  Invert onto serving platter. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
