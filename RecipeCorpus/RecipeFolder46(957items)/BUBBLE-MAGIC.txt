The is a cute idea for one or several kids.  Using a large bucket as a
Cauldron, fill it with water and add dishwashing detergent.(This is
the magic potion).  Now you tell one child to be the "Wand Wizard".
This child picks up his magic wand (actually a straw) and begins to
blow into the mixture.  Next, you tell the color wizard, to begin
dropping drops of food coloring over top the bubbles. Next, the paper
wizard takes a piece of paper and gently lays it over the bubbles
tapping gently. The magic works! The paper is covered with a color
array of bubble prints. What is nice is that ALL age groups love this
and the results are different everytime you do it.  Kids can take
turns being different wizards each time.
