From "Sukiyaki, the Art of Japanese Cooking and Hospitality", by
Fumiko. Edited and copyrighted by Scotty Guletz. Hawaii and Pacific
Books. No date given.

This is an interesting little book (booklet, really) that must have
come out just after WW II.  It was written by a Japanese lady living
in Hawaii and tends to emphasize how genteel and hospitable the
Japanese culture is++probably a good idea considering the historical
context of the book.

The recipes are all pretty basic but look good and call for real
Japanese ingredients that I'm sure were either scarce or unavailable
on the Mainland at the time. Shoyu is, of course, soy sauce. I can't
believe that "gourmet powder" could be anything but MSG. Though it
doesn't call for "fiddleheads" by name, I can't imagine what else
"fern shoots" could be.
