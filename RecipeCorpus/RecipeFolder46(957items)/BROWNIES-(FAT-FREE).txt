Folks--your guess is as good as mine as to how, exactly, to make
these, as well as the number of servings (I took a stab at it).

Was downloading my packet yesterday, when I heard them talking about
this recipe on the TV and quickly ran for paper & pencil. There were
no real clear directions given (or I missed them) so you're on your
own!

Cook the dates and water in a microwave for 5 minutes. Stir. That's
all I heard.  I also don't know exactly how many servings, but they
clearly said each brownie was only 110 calories and 0.5g fat.
