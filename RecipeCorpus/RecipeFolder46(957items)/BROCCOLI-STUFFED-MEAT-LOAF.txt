Title: BROCCOLI STUFFED MEAT LOAF
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 lb Lean Ground Beef
1    Egg
4 tb Bread Crumbs
4    Green Onions, Minced
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Basil Leaves, Dried
1/8 ts Black Pepper
1 1/2 c  Broccoli Flowerettes
1/2 c  Mild Cheddar Shreds
1 tb Butter, Melted
1 tb Tomato Ketchup
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the beef, egg, 1/2 the bread
crumbs, 3/4 of the minced green onion, 3/4 of the salt, the basil and
the pepper. Set aside. Bring a pot of water to a full boil. Drop in
the broccoli flowerettes. Cook until just tender-crisp (3 to 4
minutes). Drain thoroughly. Mix with the cheese, the remaining bread
crumbs, green onions and salt. Press half of the meat mixture into a
loaf pan (8" x 4"), forming an indentation in the center. Leave a 1"
thick layer on the sides. Fill the indentation with the broccoli
mixture. Top the broccoli with the remaining meat mixture. Seal well
around the edges, completely enclosing the broccoli. Mix the melted
butter and ketchup. Brush the top of the loaf with this mixture. Bake
until the loaf pulls away from the sides of the pan and the meat is
done (about 60 minutes). Serve hot. Cut in slices.
