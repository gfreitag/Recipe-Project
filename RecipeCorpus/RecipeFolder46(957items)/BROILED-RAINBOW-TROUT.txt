Title: BROILED RAINBOW TROUT
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Rainbow trout
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Oil
Lemon wedges
Recipe by: The Fannie Farmer Cookbook Preheat the broiler. Sprinkle
the cavity with salt and pepper. Rub the outside with oil. Place on
an oiled rack 5-inches below the broiler (at the second level) and
broil for 5 minutes on each side. The skin will just be spottily
charred and the flesh moist and tender. Serve with lemon wedges.

Variations:

Broiled Trout with Rosemary:
Place a sprig of rosemary in the cavity of each trout before
cooking.

Broiled Trout with Cream:
Use a shallow pan instead of the broiler rack. After broiling 2-3
minutes on the second side, pour 3/4 cup heavy cream over trout and
broil another 5 minutes, basting a couple of times.  Omit lemon
wedges and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley and 1
tablespoon of fresh tarragon or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled.
