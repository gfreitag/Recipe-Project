Title: BROWN RICE & VEGETABLE SALAD
Categories: Salads, Side dish, Rice, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Onion, finely chopped
1 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
2 oz Olive oil
8 oz Long-grain brown rice
3/4 pt Vegetable stock
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Turmeric
8 oz French beans
4 oz Peas, fresh or frozen
4 oz Corn, fresh or frozen
1 ea Red bell pepper, chopped
4 oz Peanuts -=OR=- cashews
Cook the onion & garlic in the olive oil until soft & golden. Stir in
the rice until coated evenly with the oil. Add the stock, salt &
turmeric. Bring to a boil & simmer for about 40 minutes. The rice
should be tender & all the liquid absorbed.

While the rice is cooking, prepare the vegetables. Cut the beans into
small chunks.  Cook in boiling salted water until tender (I'd prefer
to steam them). Drain well.

Cool the rice & vegetables & mix together with the bell pepper. Stir
in half the nuts & place in a serving bowl. Sprinkle with the
remaining nuts. Serve with an oil & vinegar dressing if liked.
