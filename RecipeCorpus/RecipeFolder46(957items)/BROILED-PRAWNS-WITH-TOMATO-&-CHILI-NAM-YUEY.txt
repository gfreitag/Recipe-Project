Cut off the prawns barbels and feet. Cut open each prawn back. Remove
the black digestive cord. Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a pan. Cook the
prawns over a low flame. When 1 side is cooked, turn the prawns over
to cook the other side. Remove when the prawns are well done. Put the
cooked prawns in water with some minced ginger. Bring to a boil.
Remove and drain. Put the remaining oil in a wok. Stir-fry spring
onion, ginger, and garlic for a few seconds. Add tomato sauce and
Chili Nam Yuey. Mix well. Add wine, salt, soy sauce, sugar, soup
stock and the prawns. Bring to a boil. Lower the flame and simmer
till there's almost no liquid left. Thicken with cornstarch paste and
serve. Note: The boiling step is necessary to remove the oil attached
to the grilled prawns to allow the seasonings to be absorbed. From
