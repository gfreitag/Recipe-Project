Title: BROILED/GRILLED CARIBOU STEAKS
Categories: Game, Caribou, Steak, Jw
Yield: 6 Servings
6    1/2" thick Caribou steaks
Bacon fat or lard
Basting Sauce:
1 1/2 c  Red wine
3 tb Oil
1/8 ts Ground ginger
1 ds Hot pepper sauce
Salt and black pepper
Combine all the basting sauce ingredients and soak the venison slices
in the sauce for at least 24 hours. Pour off and reserve the sauce.
Put the meat on a board and pat it dry, then nick the edges of the
slices and rub them all over with the fat.

Heat the grill to medium-high and grill the steaks until medium-rare.
Baste the meat with the reserved basting sauce while cooking and turn
it once. When done, transfer the slices to a warmed serving platter,
and serve at once, with the remaining sauce in a sauce boat.
