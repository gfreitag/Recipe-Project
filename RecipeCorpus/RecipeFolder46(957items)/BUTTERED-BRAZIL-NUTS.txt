Title: BUTTERED BRAZIL NUTS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2    To 3/4 cup whole Brazil nuts
1/3 c  Water
1 c  Brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Light corn syrup
1 1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1/4 c  Butter, chopped
Preheat oven to 225 F (110 C). On an oiled cookie sheet spread nuts
in a single layer. Warm in the oven for 5-10 minutes while preparing
the toffee mixture.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine water and sugar. Cook over low
heat until sugar is dissolved. Bring liquid to boil, add syrup, cream
of tartar and butter, simmer until butter has melted. Bring to a boil
and boil to soft crack stage, 270 F (140 C) on candy thermometer.

Remove saucepan from heat. Remove nuts from oven. With a spoon,
drizzle a little toffee over each nut. Leave to cool and harden. If
toffee is setting too quickly in the pan, place it in a bowl of hot
water. Store in a cool, dark place.

Makes about 1/2 lb.
