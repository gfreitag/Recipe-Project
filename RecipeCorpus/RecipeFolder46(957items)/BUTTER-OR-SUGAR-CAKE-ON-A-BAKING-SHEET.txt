Categories: Ethnic, German, Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
CAKE DOUGH
3/4 oz (20g) yeast
1 ts Sugar
1/2 pt (285ccm) lukewarm milk
1 1/8 lb (500g) flour
2 1/2 oz 3 1/2 (75-100g) sugar
3    Drops baking essence
Bitter almond flavor
1    Pinch salt
1 3/4 oz (50g) butter, margarine,
Or lard, or 3 tb oil
TOPPING
1 3/4 oz 4 1/2 (50-125g) butter
2 1/2 oz (75g) sugar
1    Packet vanillin sugar
1 3/4 oz (50g) almonds (blanched and
Chopped) or Hazelnuts
(blanched and chopped)
FOR THE CAKE DOUGH:  cream the yeast with 1 tsp of the sugar and 5
tbs of the milk. Sieve 2/3 of the flour into a large mixing bowl,
make a well in the center and pour in the yeast; cover with 1/4 in
(1/2 cm) layer of flour. Distribute the sugar, flavoring, and melted
lukewarm fat on the flour around the well; take care that they do NOT
come in contact with the yeast. As soon as the yeast shows large
cracks, begin to stir all the ingredients together, starting from the
middle, and gradually adding the rest of the milk. Beat the dough
with a strong wooden spoon until it shows bubbles.  Knead in the rest
of the flour; if the dough should be sticky add a little more flour,
but not too much the dough should remain soft. Leave in a warm place
until the dough has doubled in size. Knead thoroughly again and roll
out on a greased baking sheet. Place a folded piece of greaseproof
paper against the dough at the open end of the baking sheet. FOR THE
TOPPING:  Either flake the fat evenly over the cake or melt it and
brush it over.  Mix the sugar with the vanillin sugar and nuts and
sprinkle evenly over the cake. Leave in a warm place until the cake
has doubled in size and then bake. OVEN: preheat for 5 minutes at
very hot, bake at moderately hot. BAKING TIME: about 15 minutes
