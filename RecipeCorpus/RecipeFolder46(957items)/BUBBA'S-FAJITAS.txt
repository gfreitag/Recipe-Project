Those self-appointed guardians of Texas cuisine, Bubba & Billy Joe,
stopped by the other day and saw a request for fajitas so Bubba asked
me to post his version. Serves 4 regular people or two hungry Texans.

Trim fat from steak. Pound lightly to tenderize. Place meat in
non-metallic container. Top with onion rings. Combine remaining
ingredients. Pour over meat and onions. Cover and refrigerate
overnight. (At this point he says to go out and just party, party,
party ~- just forget about these tasty fajitas 'til tomorrow.) Next
day - or whenever you find your way back home, remove the meat and
onions, reserving the marinade. Separate the meat and onions. Place
meat on grill, basting often with the marinade and turning often to
prevent charring. You gotta do this on a grill - it's not the same in
a broiler. Meanwhile, saute the onions in butter with some green and
maybe some yellow peppers sliced into strips. When the meat's done,
slice it into thin strips, cutting across the grain.
Serve with homemade refried beans, Mexican rice, guacamole, picante
sauce or salsa, sour cream, grated cheddar, your sauteed veggies and
of course, warm flour tortillas to hold it all together. Bubba uses
handmade tortillas he gets from a nearby restaurant. They're much
better than store bought. (Hint: I think this recipe is even better
with chicken, but don't tell Bubba I said that, 'cause he thinks real
men eat beef, and only sissies eat chicken!)

Thanks again Bill, Bubba and Billy Joe.
