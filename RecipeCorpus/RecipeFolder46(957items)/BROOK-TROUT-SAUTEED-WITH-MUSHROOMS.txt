Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Whole trout

12 -Fillets with skin
1/4 c  Milk
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/3 c  All-purpose flour
3 tb Vegetable oil
6 tb Unsalted butter
6 lg Mushrooms; thinly sliced
2 tb Fresh lime juice
4 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
Put the trout in a dish, add the milk, and sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Turn them several times to coat well. Set aside.

Spread the flour over a flat dish.  Remove the trout from the milk and
dredge them in the flour.  Shake off any excess flour.

Heat half of the oil in a nonstick frying pan large enough to hold 3
trout in one layer.  Cook them over medium heat for 4 minutes on one
side. Turn them and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until brown. Transfer
the trout to a warm platter and keep them warm. Repeat the process
using the remaining oil and fish.

Meanwhile, melt 1 TB. of the butter in a frying pan over high heat.
Add the mushroom slices and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute
them, stirring and shaking the pan, until the liquid has evaporated
and the mushrooms are nicely browned.

Arrange the mushrooms over the trout and sprinkle with the lime juice.

Melt the remaining butter in a frying pan over high heat, shaking the
pan, until the butter turns hazlenut brown. Pour it over the trout,
sprinkle with the parsley, and serve immediately.
