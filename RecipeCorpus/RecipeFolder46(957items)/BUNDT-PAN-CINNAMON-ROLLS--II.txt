Title: BUNDT PAN CINNAMON ROLLS  II
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 pk Regular Butterscotch pudding
-mix
1    Stick of margarine
3/4 c  Sugar
1 pk Frozen cloverleaf rolls
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
Place frozen rolls in bundt or tube pan that has been oiled, then
sprinkle pudding mix over rolls.  Melt margarine, add sugar, and
cinnamon mix together.  Pour this mixture over rolls in pan.  Add 1
cup nuts if wanted. Let rolls set out over night to rise.  Bake at
325 degrees for 30 to 45 minutes until brown on top.  I think it took
mine about 1 hour to cook. Dump out at once on plate.

This is written for you to have the rolls for breakfast.  Assemble
just before going to bed and let rise over night.
