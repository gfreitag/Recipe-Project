Title: BRUNCH SPUD BOATS
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
3 md Baking potatoes, scrubbed
No-stick cooking spray
2 tb Olive oil
3 oz Chopped lean ham or
-Canadian bacon
1/3 c  Diced zucchini
1/3 c  Diced red bell pepper
3    Green onions, with tops,
-sliced
6    Eggs, beaten
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Salsa for serving
To make potato shells: Prick potatoes with a fork and bake in a
microwave oven on a plate on high (100 percent) 7 to 11 minutes,
rotating after 3 minutes, until tender when pierced with a knife. Or
bake in a conventional oven at 450 degrees 50 to 60 minutes. They
should be soft but firm enough to dice.

Preheat oven to broil. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out
pulp, leaving a  1/2-inch shell. Dice scooped-out potato. Spray both
sides of potato shell with cooking spray. Place right side up on a
baking sheet and broil until edges are browned and top is slightly
crisp but not dry, 3 to 4 minutes. (Shells may be refrigerated
overnight. Refrigerate cooked potato separately. Bring both to room
temperature before filling.)

To make filling: Preheat oven to 500 degrees. In a large skillet,
preferably non-stick, over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil until
hot. Saute potato pulp, turning with a spatula until they begin to
turn golden, about 5 minutes, adding more oil if needed. Stir in ham,
zucchini and red pepper and saute, stirring, until vegetables soften
slightly, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, reduce heat to medium-low, and
cook, stirring lightly, until very loosely set. Stir in green onions.
Fill potato shells and sprinkle tops with cheese, if desired. Place
potatoes on baking sheet and bake 5 minutes, or until eggs are set
and cheese melts. Serve with salsa, if desired.
