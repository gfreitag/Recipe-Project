Title: BROILED~ MARINATED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Chopped scallions
1    Chopped chili pepper
1    Cloves chopped garlic
1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
2 tb Lime juice
1/4 c  Soy sauce (?)
that's about it. Then I just marinated the mushrooms in the fridge,
just like the m**t, (I did it over night), flipping them every so
often) and broiled. I served it with wildrice with onions. (I am a
very big fan of w.rice!)
