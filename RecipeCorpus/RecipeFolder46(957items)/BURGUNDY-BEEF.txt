Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 12 Servings
4 lb Beef round steak, 1 in thick
1/4 c  Shortening or bacon fat
5 lg Onions, sliced
1 lb Mushrooms, sliced
3 tb All-purpose flour
2 ts Marjoram leaves, chopped
Or
1/4 ts Dried marjoram leaves
1 ts Thyme leaves, chopped
Or
1/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 c  Beef broth
2 c  Red Burgundy or red wine
Cut beef into 1-inch cubes.  Heat shortening in 4-quart Dutch oven
until melted.  Cook beef in shortening over medium heat until brown
and liquid has evaporated; remove. Cook and stir onions and mushrooms
in Dutch oven until onions are tender, adding shortening if
necessary. Remove mushrooms and onions; cover and refrigerate. Return
beef to Dutch oven; sprinkle with flour, marjoram, thyme, salt and
pepper. Stir in broth and Burgundy. Heat to boiling; reduce heat.
Cover and simmer about 1 1/4 hours or until beef is tender (Liquid
should just cover beef). If necessary, stir in additional broth and
Burgundy (1 part broth to 2 parts Burgundy). Add mushrooms and
onions.  Heat through, stirring occasionally.  Serve over noodles if
desired.
