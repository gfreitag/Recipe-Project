While that's baking, make the second part of the filling. Whisk all

When the butternut filling is set, sprinkle evenly with pecan pieces.
Gently pour the second filling over the nuts.

Return pie to the oven, and bake at 325 F for 40 to 45 minutes, or
until just set. Cool to room temperature and serve with lightly
sweetened whipped cream.
