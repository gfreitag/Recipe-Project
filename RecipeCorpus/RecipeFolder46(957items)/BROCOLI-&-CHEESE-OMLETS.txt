Title: BROCOLI & CHEESE OMLETS
Categories: Brunch
Yield: 4 Servings
8 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
Pepper to taste
1 1/3 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
2 c  Cooled, cooked broccoli
Florets
4 tb Margarine or olive oil
1. Whisk eggs, water, salt and pepper until blended. Have your
fillings chopped and at room temperature and your serving plates
ready.

2. For each omelet: Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet until it's good
and hot and a drop of water flicked onto the surfaces bounces. Add 1
tablespoon margarine and tilt pan to coat. Add 1/2 cup egg mixture.
Work your way around the pan, drawing egg from edge to center. Repeat
until egg stops flowing but is still moist on top (egg will cook
thoroughly as omelet is filled and folded.

3. Holding skillet handle in your left hand, pointed at your navel,
put 1/4 the cheese and broccoli on the left half of omelet (lefties
reverse). Fold unfilled side over filling. If omelet tears, don't
despair!

4. Holding the skillet handle in the right hand, take a plate with the
other. Invert skillet so omelet falls upside-down onto plate. This way
you'll have a smooth surface on top.
