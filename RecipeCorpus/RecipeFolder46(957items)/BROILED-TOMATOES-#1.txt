Tomatoes
Many Mexican recipes call for tomatoes to be asados (roasted).
Traditionally they are put onto a hot comal and cooked until the skin
is wrinkled and brown and the flesh is soft right through--this takes
about 20 to 25 minutes for an 8 ounce tomato.  However, since this
method is very messy, it is best to line a shallow metal pan with
foil and put the tomatoes in it. Place them under a hot broiler--do
not have the flame too high or the tomato will burn without cooking
through--and turn them from time to time so that they cook through
evenly--the skin will be blistered and charred. A medium tomato will
take about 20 minutes. Blend the tomato, skin, core, and seeds to a
fairly smoothe sauce. The skin and core give both body and flavor to
the sauce. And never mind if the skin ~is- charred; that adds
character, too.  If the skin is very badly blackened and hard in
places, then remove a little of it. This method of cooking tomatoes
makes for a very rich-flavored sauce. FromThe Cuisines of Mexico by
Diana Kennedy, 1972.
