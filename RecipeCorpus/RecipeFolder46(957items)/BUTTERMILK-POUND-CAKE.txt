Categories: Cyberealm, Mom's best, Ww, Cakes, Low-cal
Yield: 1 Cake
1 1/2 c  Sifted flour
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
3/8 ts Salt
1    Egg
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Low-fat buttermilk
1 1/4 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Stick margarine
1 tb Unsalted butter
1 c  Sugar
1. Have all ingredients at room temperature (70F). Adjust oven racks
to divide oven in thirds; preheat oven to 325F. Spray 5 cup loaf pan,
bundt pan or tube pan with nonstick cooking spray. 2. In small bowl,
whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; sift
together and set aside. 3. In small bowl, whisk together egg and egg
whites; set aside. 4. In small bowl, combine buttermilk and vanilla;
set aside. 5. Cut margarine and butter into 1/4" chunks and place in
large bowl of electric mixer; beat at medium speed until softened,
about 1 minute. Add sugar gradually, beating constantly, until
smooth, about 3 minutes. Gradually dribble in beaten eggs, beating at
medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes. On low speed, beat in 1/3 of the
reserved flour mixture, scraping sides of bowl. On medium-high speed,
gradually dribble in 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture, scraping sides of
bowl. On low speed, beat in half of the remaining flour mixture. On
medium-high speed, beat in the rest of the buttermilk mixture,
scarping sides of bowl. On low speed, beat in the remaining flour
mixture until well combined (batter may look curdled). Pour into
prepared pan and bake until cake starts to pull away from the sides
of the pan, the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the
center of the cake comes out clean, 35-40 minutes for bundt or tube
pan, or 65-70 minutes for loaf pan. 6. Cool on rack 10-15 minutes;
invert pan and unmold onto rack to cool completely. Cut into 12
slices.
