Categories: Soups, Vegetables, British
Yield: 4 Servings
120 g  Onion; chopped
Salt, ground pepper
60 g  Butter
1/4 ts Sugar
250 g  Broad beans; shelled weight
60 ml Thick cream
1/2 ts Sage -==- OR
1/2 ts Savory -==- OR
1/2 ts Parsley; chopped
1 l  Water
CroÂ–tons
Sweat the onion with the butter in a saucepan without colouring, until
soft. Add the broad beans, together with the water and bring to the
boil. Add whichever herb you have chosen, chopped fine (I recommend
the use of savory), season with salt, sugar and pepper.

When the beans are cooked, take out a tablespoonful or so, refresh on
cold water, skin and reserve them. Puree the soup, either in a
blender or through a sieve. Reheat to simmering point, stir in the
cream, correct the seasoning and add the reserved beans.

Serve hot with freshly cooked home made croutons.
