Title: BULL FROGS (SLUSH)
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 Gallon
3 cn (12 oz ea) Frozen Limeade
3 l  Bottles 7-Up soft drink(+/-)
12 oz Vodka (+/-)
Green Food Coloring (Opt)
Mix the limeade, 1 liter of the 7-Up and the vodka together, mixing
well. (Vodka and 7-Up may be adjusted to taste, but the overall
mixture should look 'slushy' as opposed to 'watery'.) Add green food
coloring if desired. Pour the loose slush into a container, cover,
and place in freezer (an old 1 gallon plastic ice cream bucket works
wonderfully for this). This mixture can be stored in the freezer for
many months.

To serve, use an ice cream scoop and fill cocktail glass halfway full
with frozen slush.  Fill the glass the rest of the way full with 7-Up
soft drink (from the remaining liter bottles); stir. The result
should be a light green 'slush' drink that tastes quite a bit like a
Margarita. Refreshing on a warm day, and good to just have on hand
for last minute company.
