tomatoes (like restaurant waxed); or you could french fry cut the
tomato by hand. Heat oil in skillet and saute broccoli florets and
nuts for 1 minute, stirring constantly to prevent nuts from burning.

the skillet. Using metal blade of food processor, drop garlic through
the feed tube with motor running and mince. Add garlic and rice to
butter in skillet and saute about 2 minutes until rice is golden;
stir in stock and simmer about 10 minutes unto rice is tender. Add
more stock if needed to cook rice. Remove skillet from heat. While
rice cooks, process the tomatoes into strips with french fry disk.
Drain off excess liquid and add the tomatoes, broccoli, nuts, raisins
and artichoke  hearts to skillet,tossing over medium heat just until
the vegetables are heated through. Season to taste with salt, pepper
and cayenne pepper. Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.

Variation:  Substitute slivered almonds.  Omit the artichokes.
