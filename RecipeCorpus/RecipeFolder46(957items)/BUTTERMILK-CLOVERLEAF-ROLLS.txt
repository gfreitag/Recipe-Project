Title: BUTTERMILK CLOVERLEAF ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Kooknet
Yield: 1 1/2 dozen
1/2 c  Butter
2 c  Buttermilk
2 pk Dry Yeast
1/2 ts Baking Soda
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
5 c  Flour
1    Egg; beaten to mix
Heat the butter and buttermilk until hot. Combine with the yeast and
let stand 2-3 minutes until the yeast has dissolved. Stir in the
baking soda, sugar and salt. Gradually stir in flour until the dough
starts to leave the sides of the bowl. Knead the dough on a floured
work surface, adding more flour if sticky, until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball, put in a buttered
bowl, and turn so that it is buttered all over.

Cover and let rise until double in bulk, about 45 minutes. Butter
three 6 cup muffin tins. Punch the dough down. Divide into 18
portions; ten form each into 3 balls. Put 3 balls into each muffin
cup. Cover and let rise until double in size, about 30 minutes. Heat
the oven to 400Ã¸F. Brush the tops of rolls with egg. Bake until the
rolls are browned, 15-20 minutes.
