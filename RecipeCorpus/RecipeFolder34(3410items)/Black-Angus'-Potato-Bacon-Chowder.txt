Title: Black Angus' Potato Bacon Chowder
Categories: Meats, Soup/stew, Potatoes
Yield: 12 - 15 folks
3    Chicken bouillon cubes;
3 1/2 c  Potatoes; 1/4" diced
1 1/2 qt Half & half -=OR=-
1 1/2 qt Half & half & low-fat milk
-Mixture; **
3    Strips bacon;* cooked then
-diced
1 md -large Onion; quartered
-then sliced 3/4" thick
1 c  Celery; diced
2 tb Margarine;
4 c  Water;
3/8 ts Tabasco Sauce;
1/4 ts White pepper;
* Sometimes I have used ham instead of bacon. ** I use low-fat powder
milk or canned milk or low-fat powder and canned milk mixture.

In a large heavy pot, saute onion and celery in margarine until
tender. Add water, Tabasco sauce, Worcestshire sauce, white pepper,
bouillon cubes and salt.  Stir and bring to a simmer.  Add the
potatoes and cook until potatoes are tender, not mushy.  Add the half
and half, and bring to a simmer.  If a thicker texture* is desired,
puree one cup of the soup in a food processer, then return it to pot.
Add diced bacon. Serve warm.

*I add some instant potatoes instead to the chowder to the desired
thickness.

NOTE: A chowder that is served in one of the more popular restaurant
in San Diego.
