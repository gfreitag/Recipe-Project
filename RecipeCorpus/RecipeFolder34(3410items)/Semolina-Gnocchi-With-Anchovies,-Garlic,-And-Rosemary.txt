1. Start by making the anchovy butter: Combine the garlic, rosemary,
parsley, anchovies, and butter in a food processor and process until
smooth. Season with salt and pepper and refrigerate.

2. Make the gnocchi: Combine the skim milk and 1 tsp salt in a heavy 3
1/2-qt saucepan and bring to a boil. Sprinkle in the semolina or
cornmeal very slowly, whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to very
low and simmer, covered, for 15 mins, stirring often. Remove the pan
from the heat, add the butter and the 1/2 cup Parmesan, season with
salt and pepper, and mix well.

3. Rinse a rectangular baking pan or cookie sheet with cold water.
Spoon the polenta into the pan and sooth evenly with a wet spatula
into a 1/2-inch-thick layer. Chill for 1 hour.

4. Preheat the oven to 350 F.

5. With a 1-inch round cookie cutter, cut the polenta into disks.
Place them, slightly overlapping, in a well-buttered heavy baking
dish. Dot with the anchovy butter, sprinkle with the remaining 3 Tbs
Parmesan, and bake for 30 mins. Serve at once, directly from the
baking dish.

NOTE: If you want to cut down on the fat and calories in this dish,
you can omit the anchovy butter and instead add a large mincing of
herbs right into the gnocchi mixture. Once the mixture is cold, the
gnocchi can be cut and sauteed in just a touch of olive oil or
grilled.
