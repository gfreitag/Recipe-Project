Title: GEORGIA BAR-B-Q HASH
Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats, Poultry
Yield: 12 servings
16 oz Creamed corn
1 c  Cider vinegar
2 tb Pepper, black
1 tb Cayenne, ground
1/2 tb Red pepper flakes
1 tb Salt
2 lb Lean pork roast
2 lb Lean beef roast or chuck
1 lb Chicken, white meat; (opt)
1 lg Onion
28 oz Tomatoes, canned
16 oz White corn
Cut meat into large chunks.  Place in a heavy pot and add water to
barely cover. Simmer more than an hour. When the meat is very tender,
drain and reserve any broth.  Grind the meat with a coarse hand
grinder or chop finely.  (Using a food processor destroys the
texture.) Grind one large onion. Place onion and the meat back into
the pot and add one large can of tomatoes -juice and all. Add corn,
vinegar and seasonings. Simmer a few minutes. Add the reserved broth
to the meat until it reaches the consistency of stew.  Serve it over
white rice or bread with dill pickles on the side as a condiment.
