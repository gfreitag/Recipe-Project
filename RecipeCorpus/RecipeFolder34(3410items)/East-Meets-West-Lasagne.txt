East Meets West Lasagne
=======================
(A nondairy favorite of Bill and Akiko Shurtleff, authors to _The
Book of Tofu_.)

8 oz whole wheat lasagne noodels
2 Tbsp oil for sauteing
1 clove garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped 8 oz mushrooms, sliced (about 10 medium)
2 c chopped celery
1 green pepper, chopped
2 1/2 c tomato sauce (two and a half 8-oz cans)
1 1/4 c tomato paste (two 6-oz cans)
2 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp honey
1 tsp each cumin, basil, and oregano
28 oz firm tofu, mashed
2 Tbsp nutritional yeast, optional

Cook noodles, drain, and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 F. Heat oil
in a skillet and saute garlic for 30 seconds.  Add onion and
mushrooms and saute 3 to 4 minutes. Add celery and green pepper and
saute 3 minutes. Add remaining ingredients except tofu, bring to a
boil, and simmer 3 minutes. Spread a third of this sauce in the
bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  On top of it put half the
noodles, then half the tofu.  (Sprinkly on 1 Tbsp nutritional yeast,
if desired.) Repeat the layers of sauce, noodles, and tofu (and
optional yeast). Top with the remaining tomato sauce.  Bake 25 to 30
minutes.
