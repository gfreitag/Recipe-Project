dry. Chop spinach. Mix ricotta, eggs and nutmeg in large bowl. Stir
in spinach and Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.

Cut off 1/3 of dough. Roll out on lightly floured surface as thinly as
possible. Trim to 18x11-inch rectangle. Spread with 1/3 of spinach
mixture, leaving 1/2-inch border on all sides. Cover filling with 8
prosciutto slices, then 1/3 of mozzarella. Fold 1 inch of each long
side over filling. Brush edges of short ends with water. Starting at
1 short end, roll pasta up jelly roll fashion. Wrap in cheesecloth
and tie with string to hold shape. Repeat with remaining dough and
filling.

Bring 2 inches of water to boil in large roasting pan on top of
stove. Add pasta rolls. Reduce heat, cover and siinmer 35 minutes.
Using 2 spatulas, remove rolls and cool. Gently remove string and
cheesecloth. Wrap tightly and refrigerate overnight.

Vinaigrette.
