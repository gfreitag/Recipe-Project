Yield: 3 dozen
MMMMM----------------------PRALINE TOPPING---------------------------
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Chopped pecans
MMMMM------------------------COOKIE DOUGH-----------------------------
1 c  Firmly packed light brown
-sugar
2 tb Granulated sugar
1 lg Egg
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted
-butter, slightly softened
Make praline topping: On a large baking sheet in a preheated 350'F
oven, toast pecans 9 to 10 minutes, until fragrant but not burned.
Remove from oven and set aside to cool.

In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine sugar with 2 T
water. Bring to boil, stirring frequently to dissolve sugar. Cover
and boil 2 minutes. Uncover and cook 2 to 2 1/2 minutes longer, or
until syrup thickens slightly, bubbles and turns deep amber, but not
dark brown. Immediately add toasted pecans to syrup, stirring to
coat. (Caution: mixture is very hot.) Quickly turn praline mixture
onto a buttered dish and cool completely.

Transfer the praline to a heavy plastic bag. Using a mallet or the
back of a heavy spoon, crack the mixture into tiny pieces. Store in
an airtight container in refrigerator or freeze up to 1 month.

Make cookie dough: In a medium bowl sift together flour, baking
powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.

In another medium bowl beat butter until fluffy. Add sugars, egg and
vanilla and continue to beat until smooth and well blended. Add half
the dry mixture and beat until blended. Stir in remaining dry mixture
until well blended.

Set aside 1/3 C of the praline mixture. Stir the remaining mixture
into cookie dough.

Form dough into 1-inch balls. Dip top of each ball into reserved
praline. Space balls 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheets. Bake in
center of a preheated 375'F oven 10 to 11 minutes, or until cookies
are lightly golden around the edges. Remove from oven and let stand 2
minutes, then transfer cookies to wire racks and cool completely.
Store in an airtight container 1 week, or freeze up to 1 month. Makes
3 dozen 3-inch cookies.
