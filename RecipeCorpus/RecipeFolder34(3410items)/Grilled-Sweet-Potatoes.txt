Title: Grilled Sweet Potatoes
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
-about 1/2 lb
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Shredded coconut
1/4 c  Pineapple juice
1/4 c  Coconut milk
1 lg Sweet potato
Preheat the grill.

Preheat the oven to 350F. Scatter the coconut in a shallow baking pan
and toast in the oven until evenly browned, shaking the pan
occasionally, 5-7 minutes. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the
pineapple juice and coconut milk and stir to mix.

Peel the sweet potato and cut in -inch slices. Lightly brush the
slices with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the
slices over a medium-hot fire and cook just until browned, 1-2
minutes. Using long-handled tongs, turn the slices and continue
cooking until browned and crisp, about 1 minute longer.

Transfer the slices to a platter. Drizzle with the pineapple-coconut
mixture and sprinkle with the toasted coconut. Serve immediately.
