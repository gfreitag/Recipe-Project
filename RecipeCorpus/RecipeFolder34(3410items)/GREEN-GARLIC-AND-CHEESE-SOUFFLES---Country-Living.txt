-only
1/8 ts Salt
1 pn Ground black pepper
1/4 c  Plus 2 T water
1/4 ts White-wine vinegar
1/2 c  Milk
1. In 2-quart saucepan, melt 1/2 tablespoon butter. Add garlic, salt,
pepper, water, and vinegar. Heat to simmering over low heat; cover
and cook 10 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to medium, and cook 4 to
5 more minutes or until all water evaporates. Add milk and heat just
until bubbles form at edge of pan. Transfer mixture to blender and
puree for 1 minute.

2. In 1-quart saucepan, melt remaining 2 T  butter over low heat. Add
flour and thyme and stir until all lumps disappear and mixture is
evenly combined. Stir in garlic puree little by little until mixture
is smooth and thick. Make sure to stir flour along bottom edge of
pan. Transfer mixture to 1-quart bowl. Add Gruyere and 1 T of
Parmesan and mix well. Let mixture cool 10 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, lightly butter four 4-oz ramekins; dust with 1 T
Parmesan in all. Heat oven to 450'F.

4. In clean bowl, beat egg whites until firm but not stiff peaks
form. Stir egg yolks into cool garlic mixture. Fold half of egg
whites into garlic mixture, then fold in other half. (Mixture need
not be uniformly combined.) Work quickly and keep light and fluffy.

5. Divide souffle mixture among prepared ramekins, filling them to
just below top rim. Run your thumb around inside rims of ramekins so
that souffles form a cap. Sprinkle tops with remaining 1/2 tablespoon
Parmesan. Place ramekins on rimmed baking sheet and set on middle
rack of oven. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until souffles are brown on
top and set everywhere but center. Transfer souffles to plates and
serve immediately.
