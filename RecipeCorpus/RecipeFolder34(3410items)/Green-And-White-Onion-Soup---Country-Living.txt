Note: A variety of onions forms the basis of this flavorful soup.  To
create a swirled pattern in the green soup, use the itp of a knife to
draw the white soup through the green soup.

Prepare White-Onion Soup: In 2 quart saucepan, heat butter.  Add
onion and white part of green onions; saute 5 minutes.  Stir in flour
until well mixed.  Add broth and heat to boiling, stirring
constantly, until thickened.  Stir in milk and pepper; set soup aside.

Prepare Green-Onion Soup: In 3-quart saucepan, heat oil.  Add leeks;
saute 5 minutes.  Cover and cook leeks over low heat 15 minutes or
until tender, stirring occasionally.

Sprinkle leeks with flour and stir until well mixed.  Stir in broth
and heat to boiling.  Add green onion tops; cook 1 minute.  Remove
from heat; stir in milk and salt.

In blender, puree White-Onion soup until smooth; return to saucepan
and set aside.  In blender (no need to wash), puree Greeen-Onion Soup
until smooth. Return to saucepan. (Both soups can be made ahead,
covered and refrigerated.)

Just before serving, reheat soups just until hot.  To serve, ladle
green soup into bowls and spoon white soup in the center.  Sprinkle
with chives, if desired.  Serve immediately.
