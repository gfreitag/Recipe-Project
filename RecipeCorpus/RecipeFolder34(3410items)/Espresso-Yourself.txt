Canadians love their jolt of java.  Coffee bars, serving everything
from a regular cuppa to gourmet brews like espresso and cafe au lait,
are cropping up everywhere.  But a lot of oh-so-delicious gourmet
coffee drinks aren't oh-so-low-fat.  Add whole milk, chocolate syrup,
whipped cream or grated milk chocolate, and the calories start adding
up quickly. The trick is to know what to order and how to order it.
We're happy to spill the beans... Made with homogenized milk

CAFE AU LAIT: (12 oz) Equal amounts of hot strong coffee and hot milk
in a large bowl or mug.  6 grams fat, 118 calories. CAFE LATTE: (6
oz) 1/4 espresso coffee to 3/4 foamed milk.  5 grams fat, 86
calories. CAFE MOCHA: (8 oz) Espresso mixed with mocha or chocolate
syrup and steamed milk, then topped with whipped cream and chocolate
sprinkles. 10 grams fat, 217 calories. CAPPUCCINO (6 oz) Espresso and
steamed milk topped with a cloud of foamed milk. 4 grams fat, 77
calories. LATTE MACCHIATO: (6 oz) A glass half filled with hot
frothed milk, into which a demitasse of espresso is dribbled.
Although most people assume that espresso is as strong in caffeine as
it is in flavor and aroma, it generally has less caffeine than
regular drip filtered coffee. If you are counting calories, order you
drinks "skinny" - made with 1% milk. Origin: Homemakers, April '95
