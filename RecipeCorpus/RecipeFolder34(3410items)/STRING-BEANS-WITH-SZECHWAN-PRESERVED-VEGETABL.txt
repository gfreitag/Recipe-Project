Categories: Chinese, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Red wine vinegar
1/4 c  Szechuan preserved
-- vegetable; chopped
1 tb Sesame seed oil
1 ts Salt
1 tb Soy sauce
1 lb String beans
1 tb Sugar
2 c  Oil; for deep-frying
2 tb Chicken stock
1    Slice ginger; chopped
2    Scallions; chopped
1/4 lb Ground pork
1.Wash string beans.  Cut off ends and string.  Cut into 1 1/2 inch
pieces. Dry on paper towel.

2.Heat oil until smoking hot; slide in string beans gently. Deep fry
beans until wrinkled, about 5 min. Turn frequently. Drain. Remove.

3.Reheat 2 Tbsp oil in wok.  Stir fry ginger for 10 seconds. Add
pork. tir fry until color changes.  Add preserved vegetable. Add
beans, salt, soy sauce, sugar, and stock. Stir fry 2 minutes or until
dry. Add last 3 ingredients. Stir fry for 1 minute or until
thoroughly heated.

Serve hot or cold You can find the preserved vegeable in the canned
food section of most Asian groceries. I find that stir frying >> the
string beans in a little bit of oil works as well as deep frying them
in 2 cups of oil.

Here's a recipe from "Madame Wong's Long Life Chinese Cookbook." I
don't know about the long life bit, but the dish is quite good. I
hope it's the one you are looking for. Formatted by Elaine Radis
