1. Prepare Pastry Dough: In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium
speed, beat butter, cream cheese, and granulated sugar until well
mixed. Add egg yolk and beat well. Reduce mixer speed to low.
Gradually beat in 2 1/2 C flour and the baking powder until smooth
dough forms. Beat in enough of remaining 1/2 C flour until dough is
no longer very sticky. Cover and refrigerate pastry dough at least 1
hour.

2. Meanwhile, prepare Filling: In 1-quart saucepan, combine poppy
seeds, milk, granulated sugar, butter, cocoa, and cinnamon. Cook over
medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened-about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat. Stir in chocolate and vanilla until smooth. Set
aside to coot to room temperature.

3. Prepare Egg Glaze: In cup, beat egg and water until well mixed.

4. Heat oven to 350'F. Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil or
parchment paper. On floured surface, roll pastry dough to 1/8-inch
thickness. With fluted pastry wheel or knife, cut dough into 3-inch
squares. Reroll trimmings and cut out more squares.

5. Place about 2 t filling in center of each square. Brush pastry
dough around filling with some glaze. Bring 2 opposite corners of
square over filling in center, overlapping the corners, and press
gently to seal. Place pastries, 1 inch apart, on lined baking sheets
and brush with some glaze. Sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired.

6. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool pastries on wire rack.
Store in airtight container.
