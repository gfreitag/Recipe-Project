1/2 ts Salt
3    Large eggs
1 ts Almond extract
1 c  Buttermilk
Fresh mint sprigs (opt.)
Fresh cranberries (opt.)
4 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries
2 1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  (1 1/2 sticks) butter,

1/4 c  Red currant jelly
1/4 c  Orange juice
2 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Grated fresh gingerroot
1 ts Grated orange rind
1. Grease a 9-inch springforrn pan; line bottom with waxed paper;
grease paper. In 2-quart saucepan, combine 1 C cranberries, 1 C
sugar, 1/4 C (1/2 stick) butter, the red currant jelly, orange juice,
cornstarch, gingerroot, and orange rind. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until mixture boils and thickens-about 10
minutes. Remove from heat; drain off and reserve 1/3 C syrup from
mixture; set aside. Stir remaining cranberries and 1/4 C sugar into
mixture in saucepan; set aside to cool while preparing cake batter.

2. Heat oven to 325F. In medium-size bowl, sift together flour, baking
powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat remaining 1 C sugar and
1/2 C (1 stick) butter until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition. Stir in almond extract.

4. Add dry ingredients to butter mixture alternately with buttermilk,
beating until a smooth batter forms. Spread cranberry mixture in an
even layer in bottom of prepared pan; spoon batter evenly over
cranberry mixture. Place cake pan on rimmed cookie sheet to catch any
drippings. Bake 60 to 65 minutes or until cake tester inserted in
center comes out clean. Cool cake in pan on wire rack 45 minutes.

5. To serve, invert cake onto serving plate; remove pan and waxed
paper. Drizzle reserved syrup on top of cake. Cut into 8 wedges;
garnish each serving with mint and cranberries, if desired.
