Mix dressing ingredients up, and set aside.  In large container, mix
salad ingredients together.  Pour dressing over top, and cover.
Allow salad to sit overnight to fully blend flavors. **NOTE** I use a
large plastic container.  Once the salad and dressing is all mixed, I
turn it over from time to time to allow the dressing to get mixed
thorougly without crushing any of the chunks of veggies.
