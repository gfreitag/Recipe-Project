Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Onions -- sliced
2 tb Fresh Rosemary -- chopped
3 tb Fresh Mint -- chopped
1 tb Fresh Thyme Leaves
1 tb Parsley -- chopped
1 c  White Wine
3 c  Veal Stock
6    Cloves Garlic
4    Lamb Shanks
2 ts Kosher Salt
1/2 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
-ground
2 tb Flour
2 tb Olive Oil
1. Preheat the oven to 325 F.

2. Cut one of the garlic cloves in half and rub the lamb shanks with
the halves. Cut the remaining cloves into thin slices and set aside.
Season the shanks with 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp freshly ground pepper
and dredge in the flour.

3. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or large
ovenproof skillet. Add the lamb shanks and brown on all sides. Remove
the shanks from the pan and set aside.

4. Toss in the onions and sliced garlic and cook 3 to 5 mins, until
softened. Add the rosemary, mint, thyme, and parsley and cook an
additional 3 to 4 mins.

5. Add the wine to the pan, raise the heat to high, and reduce by
half. Stir in the veal stock, season with the remaining salt and
pepper, and bring to a simmer. Place the lamb shanks in the pan,
cover, and bake for 2 hours, until the meat is fork-tender.

6. Uncover the pan and turn the oven up to 500 degrees. Let the lamb
shanks brown in the oven for 20 mins, basting the meat thoroughly
with the pan gravy every 5 mins.

7. Remove the shanks from the pan and keep them covered and warm.
Strain the pan gravy into a bowl and, using a bulb baster or ladle,
skim as much fat as possible from the surface. Return the gravy to
the Dutch oven and reduce by half over high heat. Transfer the lamb
shanks to a warm serving platter. Spoon part of the gravy over the
shanks and serve the rest in a sauceboat on the side.
