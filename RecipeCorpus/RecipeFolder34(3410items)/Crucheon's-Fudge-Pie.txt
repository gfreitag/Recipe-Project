Title: Crucheon's Fudge Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
3 lg Eggs, at room temperature
1 c  Plus 2 Tbsp. sugar
Heavy whipping cream
-whipped
1    Single-crust recipe
Lightly baked
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
8 tb Unsalted butter (1 stick)
Make the pie crust and cool the baked shell.  Preheat the oven to 375
degrees.

Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler placed
over simmering water.  Cool until the mixture is tepid.

Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs and sugar in a
medium-size mixing bowl until the mixture is thick and light yellow,
about 80 seconds.

Add the chocolate mixture and mix on medium speed until blended,
about 30 seconds. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a
rubber spatula and mix for 15 seconds more.

Cover the edge of the pie crust with a strip of aluminum foil so that
it won't burn and pour the filling in.  Bake the pie on the center
oven rack until the filling is set and forms a crust and a tester
inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs, 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove the foil from the crust after 30 minutes of baking.

Serve the pie warm with whipped cream.
