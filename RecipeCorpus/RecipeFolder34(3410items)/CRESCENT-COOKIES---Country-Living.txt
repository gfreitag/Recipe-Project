1 tb Water

1. In large bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed, beat butter
and sour cream until smooth. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat
in 1 1/2 C flour to form a soft dough. With spoon, stir in 1/4 to 1/2

shape each into a flat ball. Wrap and refrigerate 2 hours or
overnight.

2. Heat oven to 350'F. Grease large baking sheet. In small bowl,
combine walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon. In cup, beat egg with water. On
lightly floured surface, roll out one ball of dough to a 9 1/2-inch
round. Brush with some egg mixture and sprinkle with one third of
walnut mixture. Cut dough round into 12 wedges.

3. Starting from outer edge of each wedge, roll up to the point. Place
wedges 1 point sides down, on greased baking sheet. Bend the ends to
curve into a crescent shape. Repeat with remaining dough rounds.
Brush each crescent lightly with some egg mixture.

4. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool crescent
cookies on wire rack. Store in airtight container.
