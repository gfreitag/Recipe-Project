Title: Tiramisu (Italian Coffee And Marscapone Cream)
Categories: Italian, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
12    Biscotti di savoiardi
-(Italian ladyfingers)
1/3 c  Espresso coffee
3 oz Dark sweet chocolate,
-grated
2/3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
4 lg Egg yolks
1/2 ts Vanilla
9 oz Marscapone
4    To 6 Tbsp dark rum, or to
-taste
In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil,
stirring, over medium heat.  Continue to boil, brushing down the
sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water, until it reaches
the soft- ball stage, or a candy thermometer registers 240 deg.F.

In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the yolks until they are
combined, then add the sugar syrup in a stream.  Beat until cool.
Beat in the vanilla.

In a bowl, whisk the marscapone and rum until smooth.  In another
bowl, beat the heavy cream until it holds soft peaks.  Combine the
egg mixture with the marscapone.  Fold in the heavy cream.

Line a 6-cup serving dish with the biscotti and drizzle the espresso
over them.  Spoon in the marscapone mixture, smoothing the top, and
chill, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 3 hours or overnight.
Before serving, sprinkle the top with the grated chocolate. Source:
