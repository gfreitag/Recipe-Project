more as necessary. Transfer the cooked beans to a large kettle or
saucepan. Include about 2-3 cups of their cooking liquid. In a heavy
skillet, saute garlic, seasonings, lime juice, and bell peppers in
olive oil over medium-low heat until the peppers are tender (10-15
minutes. Add the saute to the cooked beans, along with tomato puree
and minced green chilies. Simmer uncovered over very low heat
stirring now and then for about 45 minutes. (Make the salsa during
this time.) Serve topped with Red Onion Salsa and, if desired, grated
cheese and sour cream. RED ONION SALSA DIRECTIONS: Combine all

bried whirl or two in a food processor or blender. Yield: 6-8
