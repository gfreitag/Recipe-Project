2 c  Warm water

Making the Dough: Pour the water into a large mixing bowl. Add and
dissolve the honey and the yeast.  Stir in the whole wheat flour,
salt, curry, vegetable oil, and then the unbleached flour. Turn out
onto a floured surface and knead until it's smooth and springy. Clean
and grease your bowl, and put the dough in it to rise for about an
hour. Making the Topping: While the dough rises in a warm spot, you
cna prepare the topping. It isn't necessary to use all of the listed
ingredients, but the more the merrier. You can probably think of some
things to add yourself. Blend all of the topping ingredients together
in a large mixing bowl and set aside. Shaping and Decorating: When
the dough has doubled in bulk, knock it down, turn it out on your
floured board and divide into 3 pieces. Roll each piece out to fit a
12-inch pizza pan, lightly oil the pan, and place the dough on it.
Spread one third of the mixture on each circle of dough. The longer
this has to rise, the better it will be. Give it at least 15 minutes
and try to hold out for 30. Fifteen minutes before you want to bake
the pizza, preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Baking: Bake for 15 to
20 minutes. If the pizza seems to be browning too quickly, turn the
temperature down to 425 degrees for the final few minutes.
