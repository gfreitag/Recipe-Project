1. Prepare Crust: In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed,
beat butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Reduce
mixer speed to low and gradually beat in flour until well mixed. If
dough is very soft, beat in 1 tablespoon additional flour. Cover and
refrigerate dough 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line twenty-four 1 1/4-inch
muffin-pan cups with fluted petit four paper liners.

2. Heat oven to 350'F. Spoon 1 level T  dough into each paper cups.
Divide dough evenly, if necessary, to fill each cup . With floured
fingertips, press dough into bottom and up side of each paper-lined
cup. Bake 15 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, prepare Filling: In small bowl, combine granulated
sugar and flour. Stir in egg, lemon rind and juice, and salt until
well mixed.

4. Remove cups from oven. With end of wooden-spoon handle, press the
center of each puffed-up crust to make a hollow. Spoon Filling,
dividing evenly, into each cup. As filling sinks in, spoon in a bit
more. Bake lemon cups 13 minutes or until set. Cool lemon cups on
wire rack completely.

5. If desired, prepare Topping: Melt chocolate in the microwave. Make
a waxed-paper cone: Fold a 12-inch square of waxed paper diagonally
in half. With the folded edge as the point of the cone, roll up
triangle into a cone; tape edge to seal. Fill cone with melted
chocolate. Cut a tiny opening at the pointed end of cone. Pipe lines
of chocolate over tops of cups, if desired. Let chocolate dry before
storing cookies. Store cookie cups in airtight container in the
refrigerator.
