Title: Savoury Oven Roasted Potatoes
Categories: Potatoes, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
4-5 medium potatoes,
-washed and cut into
-quarters
(red potatoes are EXCELLENT
-done this way)
1 pk Onion soup mix
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1/4 c  Melted margarine
1 ts Basil
1 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Pepper
In a shallow baking pan, blend onion soup with oil, margarine and
spices. Add potatoes and stir to coat thoroughly.  Bake at 450F for
40-45 minutes, stirring occasionally until potatoes are tender and
golden brown. Makes 4 servings.  Pour off extra grease before
serving. ****** I found that this was awful greasy when I made it.  I
think I would cut the amounts of margarine and oil down when I do it
a second time... perhaps even cut them out entirely and just use a
non stick spray. Mix the onion soup mix with a bit of water OR a tiny
amount of margarine OR oil instead of both.******** Origin: Sandi
