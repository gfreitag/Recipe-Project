1/2 c  Carrots -- sliced
1/2 c  Celery -- sliced
1/2 c  Onions -- sliced
2 c  Chicken Stock
1 13/16 lb Chicken
1/2 ts Kosher Salt
Black Pepper -- freshly

4    Sprigs Thyme
1. The day before roasting (or at least 8 hours ahead.) season inside
and out with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. (If using kosher
chicken, season with pepper ONLY)

2. Preheat the oven to 425 F.

3. Truss the chicken, tying its legs together tightly with kitchen
twine. Rub the butter all over the chicken, Place breast side down on
a roast rack set in a roasting pan. Transfer the pan to the oven and
roast for 30 mins.

4. Remove the chicken from the oven and place the thyme, parsley,
tarragon, carrots, celery, and onions in the pan under the rack. Turn
the chicken over onto its back and continue to roast breast side up
for another 35 to 40 minutes, or until the skin is browned. To check
doneness, place a meat thermometer in the thickest point of the
thigh, being careful not to pierce through to the cavity. IT should
read 170 degrees. If you don't have a thermometer, tilt the chicken
forward on the rack until the juices run from the cavity. They should
be clear with no trace of pinkness.

5. Transfer the chicken to a platter. Allow to rest in a warm place
for 15 mins before carving. Remove the rack, tilt the roasting pan,
and pour off the fat, leaving the vegetables and herbs in the pan.
Place the pan over a medium-high flame and pour in the chicken stock
as well as any juice that has accumulated on the platter. Cook for 4
to 5 mins, scrapping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Strain.

6. Carve the chicken and serve with the hot herbed pan juices.
