Title: BUTTERY FANTAN ROLLS - Country Cooking
Categories: Country coo, Breads
Yield: 36 rolls
1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, softened
2 lg Eggs
1 ts Salt
2 tb Milk
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water (110'F to 115'F)
1/4 c  Sugar
5    To 5 1/2 C unsifted all
-purpose flour
1. In large bowl, sprinkle yeast into C warm water. Stir in sugar and
let mixture stand until foamy-about 5 minutes.

2. With wooden spoon, beat 4 1/2 C flour, the remaining 1 C warm
water, 1/4 C (1/2 stick) butter, 1 egg, and the salt into yeast
mixture until smooth. Stir in enough additional flour to make a
manageable dough.

3. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead it, adding more
of the remaining flour if necessary, until dough is smooth and
elastic-about 8 to 10 minutes.

4. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size-about 1
flour. Meanwhile, in small bowl, beat remaining egg and the milk to
make an egg wash.

5. When dough has doubled, melt remaining 1/4 C butter. Brush
thirty-six 1 1/2-inch muffin-pan cups with 2 tablespoons melted
butter.

6. With floured rolling pin, roll out dough into a 15-inch square.
Brush top with remaining melted butter and then brush with some egg
wash. Cut dough into twelve 1 1/4-inch strips. Cut each dough strip
crosswise in half. Stack 4 half-strips of dough on top of one another
and cut across into 1 1/4-inch pieces to make 6 fantan rolls. Repeat
with remaining strips of dough.

7. Place fantan roils, with cut edge up, in prepared muffin-pan cups.
Cover with clean cloth; let rolls rise, away from drafts, until
double in size-35 to 45 minutes.

8. Heat oven to 350'F. Brush tops of rolls with remaining egg wash;
bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool rolls on wire rack until
warm, then serve.
