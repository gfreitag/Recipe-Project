1. Prepare Brownie: Heat oven to 350'F. Grease an 8-inch-square
baking pan. If chocolate-glazed brownie shells are desired, grease
and flour four 2-inch molds of a scallop-shell-shaped Madeleine pan
(see Note). In top of double boiler over simmering water, melt choc-
olate and butter. Meanwhile, in large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until
well combined. Slowly beat in melted chocolate mixture. Stir in
flour, baking powder, and cinnamon just until combined.

2. Fill shell molds two-thirds full with brownie batter. Spoon
remaining batter into greased square baking pan. Bake brownie shells
6 to 7 minutes and square pan 35 to 40 minutes or until top begins to
crack. Cool brownies in pans on wire racks. When brownie shells reach
room temperature, remove from pans.

3. Prepare Caramel: In 1-quart saucepan, heat water, sugar, and lemon
juice to boiling. Cook until mixture becomes golden brown-about 10
minutes. Carefully add heavy cream and cook 2 minutes longer until
mixture thickens. Remove pan from heat and stir in butter until well
blended. Pour caramel over brownies in square pan and tilt pan to
make an even layer. Sprinkle caramel with pistachios.

4. Prepare Chocolate Glaze: Place ground chocolate in small bowl. In
small saucepan, heat cream to boiling. Stir hot cream into chocolate
until choc- olate melts. Stir in butter until well combined. Coat
brownie shells with Chocolate Glaze or drizzle glaze over
caramel-covered brownies.

5. To serve as pictured, cut caramel-covered brownies into 4 equal
pieces; place pieces on dessert plates. Spoon some whipped cream onto
center of each piece and top with chocolate-glazed brownie shell.
Serve immediately. For a less decadent dessert, prepare brownies
without making the brownie shells and cut into 8 pieces.
