Title: Persian Pumpkin Stew
Categories: Soup/stew, Middle east
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Cinnamon
1/2 md Onion ; chopped
1 pn Saffron dissolved in
1/4 c  Warm water, optional
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 lb Stew meat ; (lamb or beef)
2 sm Pumpkin ; or 1 med-small
1/2 c  Dried prunes
3 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Turmeric
Recipe by: The Persian cookbook, "Food of Life"

Brown the meat and add about 1 and 1/2 cups water.  Add tomato paste,
turmeric, cinnamon, saffron and salt and pepper and sauteed onion.
Cook covered ata simmer for about 1 and 1/2 to two hours.  Meat
should be tender and nearly falling apart stage.  You may need to add
water during cooking but you shouldn't end up with more than the
stated amount.  You don't want a watery stew. In the meantime, seed
the pumpkin and slice into 2X2 inch pieces and peel.  Brown on both
sides in corn oil.  The pumpkin should become brown in some places
and somewhat flexible but not totally cooked.  Add to meat and cook
covered an additional 20-30 minutes until tender but not falling
apart.  A fork should go into the pumpkin easily but not break it up.
Add the prunes the last 5 minutes of cooking.  They shouldn't really
cook too much but should get warm. Serve over hot basmatic rice.

Note on pumpkin:
~---------------

Baking pumpkins are the best since they are sweeter and less stringy.
I have used jack o lantern pumpkins when feeling frugal and the dish
was still good.  You want about twice the volume of meat in peeled
pumpkin slices.
