Tofu supplies the protein, and tastes similar to chicken breasts, in
this quick-to-prepare colorful vegetarian main dish.

Drain tofu, cut into 3/4 inch pieces.  Place between layers of paper
towel and weight down with a dinner plate.  Let stand 10 minutes to
compress and remove excess water.

Heat oil, 2 tbsp broth and ginger in a frypan.   Add celery, onion
and red pepper.  Stir cook over medium heat 3 minutes.  Add bean
sprouts, continue stir-cooking 1 min.

Stir in remaining broth, soy sauce and tofu.  Cook and stir gently
over medium heat until vegetables are tender-crisp, and liquid is
evaporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
