Place potatoes in large saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover by 2
inches. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer potatoes until knife
pierces centers easily, about 30 minutes. Drain potatoes and cool
slightly.

Quarter potatoes lengthwise. Cut each quarter crosswise into 3/4-inch
pieces. Place mustard in small bowl. Gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups
oil in slow steady stream. Add salt and pepper. Reserve 1/4 C
dressing; pour remaining dressing over potatoes and toss gently. Cool
completely.

Toss potatoes with diced prosciutto, green onions and 1 C crumbled
Gorgonzola. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover potatoes and
refrigerate. Cover reserved dressing and store at room temperature.
Bring potatoes to room temperature before continuing with recipe.)

Preheat broiler. Cut out 1 bread round from each bread-slice using 3
1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Cut smaller round in each larger round
using 1 3/4-inch round cookie cutter; do not remove smaller rounds
(centers). Place on baking sheet. Brush bread on both sides with oil.
Top center of each with 1/2 T crumbled Gorgonzola. Broil until
golden, 2 minutes. Cool slightly. Remove centers and reserve.

Place 5 large mustard leaves on each plate in spoke fashion. Tear
remaining leaves into bite-size pieces. Mound in center. Spoon potato
salad around leaves in center. Place 1 large bread round atop leaves
in center of each plate. Top each with poached egg. Drizzle 1 T of
remaining dressing over each egg. Sprinkle prosciutto julienne over
each. Top with crouton centers. Place Gorgonzola wedges on sides of
plates and serve.
