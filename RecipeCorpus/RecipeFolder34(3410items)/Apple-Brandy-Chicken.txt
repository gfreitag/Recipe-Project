Title: Apple Brandy Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 3 servings
1/2 c  Whipping cream
1 sm Onion; finely chopped
Parsley for garnish
Red apple
- thinly sliced, for garnish
3    Whole chicken breasts
- (boneless)
2 c  Apple juice
1 ts Dried tarragon
1/3 c  Brandy
Heat apple juice, onion and tarragon.  Reduce to 1/4 cup.  (Note: will
start to carmelize so be careful not to let it burn.)  Remove onion.
Add brandy and ignite. Reduce to 1/4 C again. Meanwhile, rub chicken
with butter or margerine and bake at 350 until tender, about 25
minutes.

Bring apple mixture to a simmer.  Microwave cream until room
temperature (about one minute on 50% power).  Slowly add to apple
mixture and reduce until thick, about 5 minutes.  Final product will
resemble caramel sauce for ice cream.

Arrange apple slices in a fan and put chicken breast on top. Put 1/3
of sauce on each breast.  Garnish with parsley.
