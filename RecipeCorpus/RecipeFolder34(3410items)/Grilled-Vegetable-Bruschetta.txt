Title: Grilled Vegetable Bruschetta
Categories: Newspaper, Vegetables, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Basil; chopped
1/4 ts Dried hot pepper flakes
4 lg Slices country-style bread;
.  cut 3/4-inch thick
1 c  Mozzarella cheese; shredded
1 sm Eggplant
1 lg Yellow summer squash
1 lg Meaty tomato
1 lg Yellow bell pepper
1/2 c  Italian dressing
Cut the eggplant lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Cut the
squash into long diagonal 1/2-inch thick slices.  Cut the tomato into
crosswise 1/2-inch thick slices.  Cut the pepper into quarters.  In a
measuring cup, combine the Italian dressing, basil and pepper flakes.
Brush all sides of the vegetables with the dressing marinade.

Grill the vegetables over medium heat, turning once until softened,
10 to 12 minutes for the eggplant; 5 to 7 minutes for the squash and
bell pepper and 1 to 2 minutes for the tomato.  Grill one side of the
bread until lightly toasted, about 1 minute.  Remove the bread and
vegetables from the grill.

Turn the bread toasted side up and divide the grilled vegetables over
the bread to make open-faced sandwiches.  Sprinkle with cheese.  Use
a spatula to transfer the bruschettas and return to the grill.  Cover
and grill until the cheese melts and the underside of the bread is
toasted, about 1 minute.
