Title: Baked Eggplant with Goat Cheese and Tomatoes
Categories: Israeli, Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
20    Basil leaves
1    Thyme sprig
Salt and pepper
Fresh tomato sauce
- See separate recipe
6    Eggplants
1/4 c  Olive oil
Flour; for coating
9    Tomatoes
1 lb Goat cheese
Choose fresh medium-small eggplants.

Cut off the stem part of each eggplant. Cut lengthwise to five
slices. One of the round slices won't be used, and can be used for
other purposes. Sprinkle each slice with salt, and let stand half and
hour. Wipe the extracted moisture with paper towels. Coat each
eggplant slice with a thin layer of flour, and shake out excess flour.

Heat some olive oil in a large pan, and fry the eggplant slices on
both sides until golden.  Place on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
Cool to room temperature.  Keep the slices of each eggplant together.

For the filling, slice the tomatoes, crumble the goat cheese and
coarsly chop the basil and thyme leaves.

In a baking pan, arrange six fried eggplant slices. Distribute 1/3 of
the filling over the slices.  Arrange another six slices over the
filling, then another 1/3 of the filling, another six slices, the
rest of the filling, and finally the top round slices.

Cut 6 bamboo skewers halfwise.  Use two halves to secure together each
filled eggplant in two different points.

Bake 10 to 15 minutes.

Spoon fresh tomato sauce on 6 individual plates. Using a flat spoon,
transfer carefully each eggplant to an individual plate. Remove bamboo
skewers, and serve immediately.
