1. Prepare Tart Shells: In medium-size bowl, combine flour, sugar,
poppy seeds, and salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter
until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water, 1 T  at a time,
until mixture holds together. Form into 4 balls.

2. Heat oven to 400'F. On floured surface, roll out each ball to a
5-inch round. Fit each round into a 4-inch fluted-tart pan with
removable bottom. Trim off excess pastry. With tines of fork, pierce
bottoms and sides of pastry. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until pastry is
lightly browned. (Pastry will shrink a little.) Cool shells in pans
on wire rack.

3. Prepare Lemon Filling: In 2-quart saucepan, combine water, lemon
juice, sugar, cornstarch, and lemon rind. Heat to boiling, stirring
constantly, over medium heat. Cook 3 minutes longer or until mixture
boils and thickens.

4. In medium-size bowl, beat yolks. Slowly beat in hot lemon mixture;
pour all back into saucepan. Cook 2 minutes longer, stirring
constantly, until heated through but not boiling. Pour Lemon Filling
into Tart Shells. Set aside on rimmed baking sheet to cool to room
temperature.

5. Prepare Meringue: In clean metal bowl, combine egg whites and
cream of tartar. With electric mixer, beat egg whites until foamy.
Gradually add sugar while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.
Heat broiler. Spoon Meringue into pastry bag fitted with star tip.
Pipe 3 lines evenly spaced in one direction, then pipe 3 lines in
other direction on top of each tart. (Use remaining meringue for
another purpose or discard.) Place tarts 4 inches from heat source
and broil until meringue is lightly browned. Cool tarts several
minutes; remove from pans; place on serving platter and serve
immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.
