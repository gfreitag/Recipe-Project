Title: Galushka
Categories: Side dish, Hungarian
Yield: 6 servings
50 ml Water (or a bit less)
Salt
250 g  Strong flour
3    Eggs
Mix flour with eggs and water and a pinch of salt until blisters
begin to appear on the surface. In a large saucepan, bring plenty of
salted water to a boil. Then place dough onto a galushka board which
should be held over the boiling water. With a knife, cut pieces of
dough from the mass, and flick straight into the water. Take care
that the water boils steadily all the time, and not to cook too many
at a time. When the galushka are done they will float to the surface.
Make sure that they are ALL removed as soon as done, or they become
soft and watery.

As you remove them from the boiling water, rinse in cold water, and
drain in a colander. When drained, toss them in hot lard or butter.
If necessary, add salt before serving. A microwave oven reheats them
perfectly too, if you want to make them in advance.
