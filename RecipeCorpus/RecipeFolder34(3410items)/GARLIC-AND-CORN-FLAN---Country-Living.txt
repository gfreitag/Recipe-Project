Title: GARLIC AND CORN FLAN - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Main dish, Vegetables, Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
Hot red-pepper sauce (opt.)
1 1/2 c  Fresh whole-kernel corn
Boiling water
1 lg Head garlic
1 tb Olive oil
2 lg Eggs
2 lg Egg yolks
1 c  Half-and-half
1. Heat oven to 375'F. Remove papery outer layer of garlic skin.
Slice off and discard about 1/2 inch of top stem end of garlic head
to expose cloves. Place garlic head, cut side up, on baking sheet and
drizzle with the oil. Turn garlic head over, cut side down, on baking
sheet and roast 30 to 40 minutes or until cloves are soft and golden
brown. Leave oven on.

2. Cool garlic until easy to handle. Extract garlic cloves by
squeezing the bottom of the head and using a fork to pull them out.
Place cloves in food processor fitted with chopping blade. Add eggs,
egg yolks, half-and-half, salt, pepper, and, if desired, a few dashes
of hot sauce to garlic cloves. Process until blended. Add corn and
process briefly.

3. Generously butter six 8-oz custard cups or ramekins and place in
large roasting pan. Ladle corn mixture into cups and place pan of
cups in oven. Fill roasting pan with 1 inch of boiling water.

4. Bake flans 30 to 40 minutes or until set. Remove custard cups from
water bath and let flans cool completely. To serve, slide a small
knife around edge of each flan to loosen; invert onto serving plate.
