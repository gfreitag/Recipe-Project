Put beans, onion, onion powder, molasses, ketchup, bbq sauce, sugar,
and hot dogs in a crockpot; stir gently to mix.  cook on low for
about 8 hrs.

If the "sauce" comes out a bit runny, just leave the lid off the pot
for the last hour or two to let some of the moisture evaporate.

Sue Matthews:   Sounds kind of like mine... except I throw in several
slices of crisp bacon (chopped in pieces), about 1/2 tsp dry mustard,
and saute diced green pepper and onion (about 1/4 cup each). It all
goes into a casserole, then 10 or 15 minutes in the microwave. Quick
and easy... and yummy!
