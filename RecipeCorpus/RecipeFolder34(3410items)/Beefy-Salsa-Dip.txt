Categories: Appetizers, Tex/mexican, Hot/spicy
Yield: 1 recipe
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Cumin
1/4 ts Red pepper
Freshly ground pepper ~
6 tb Sour cream
Picante sauce ~
1 lb Lean ground chuck
1 cn Whole tomatoes; chopped up
-- w/ juice
3 sm Idaho potatoes; peeled,
-- halved and thinly sliced
1    Rib celery; bias sliced
1/2 sm Onion; chopped
1 cn Cream of Polano Pepper Soup
Put the ground beef and the spices in an iron skillet with about 1
tablespoon water.  Brown beef over low heat about 10 minutes, until
almost done.  Break up the meat as it browns.  Stir in potatoes,
onions, celery and chopped (canned) tomatoes with juice.   Pour the
soup over the top of the mixture and stir in.  Simmer about 20 more
minutes, until potatoes are tender.  Remove from heat.
Before serving, mix in sour cream and picante sauce to taste.
Serve with tortilla chips.

NOTE: If some of the cooked mixture will be served later, add sour
cream and picante after reheating.  {So only add sour cream to what
you expect to be eaten at that time.}  This does make GREAT leftovers
& munchies!

Black olives would also be good in the mixture.
