Title: Making Horehound Drops
Categories: Candies, Herbs/spice, Companion
Yield: 1 batch
2 c  Sugar
2 tb Corn syrup or honey
1 c  Fresh horehound leaves
1 c  Water
Put the horehound in a small nonreactive sauce pan and add the water.
Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, or 20 minutes.  Allow to cool,
then remove horehound and squeeze out all the liquid.  Add the sugar
and corn syrup or honey to the pan, stir with a wooden spoon while
bringing to a boil, then turn heat down to a gentle simmer.  If
bubbles threaten to overflow the pan, reduce heat slightly and stir.

Boil to the hard-crack stage.  If you have a candy thermometer, this
is in the range of 330 F, but even so you'll need to test often
toward the end of cooking to get the hardness right.  Keep a shallow
cup of cold water nearby.  Stir the liquid occasionally, and watch
how it falls from the spoon.  When it forms a thread, begin testing
for hardness by allowing a drop of the mixture to fall into the cup
of cold water.  Don't trust your fingers to examine the now-hardened
drop in the cup; bite it.  If it's at all gooey or sticks to your
teeth, keep cooking.  When it's hard enough to crack when you bite
it, remove the pan from heat immediately.

If the mixture crystallizes, just add a cup of water and an extra
tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to the pan, scrape all the
crystalline chunks into it, and begin again.

Lightly butter a candy mold, cookie sheet, or other heatproof baking
pan, and pour in the hot mixture.  If you're using a flat-bottomed
pan, score the surface of the candy after it has cooled enough to
become firm.  This will help in breaking it apart, which should be
done as soon as the candy can be handled.

After individual "drops" are formed, sift granulated sugar or powdered
sugar over them to keep them from sticking together.  Store in a
moisture-proof container.
