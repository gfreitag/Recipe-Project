1 ts Paprika
1/8 ts Ground Cloves
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
-ground
1/2 c  Water
6    To 8 Onions, Medium
-Size -- peeled
2 tb Butter Or Margarine --

1/2 c  Honey
4 ts Dijon Mustard
2 tb Red Wine Vinegar
1. Preheat oven to 350 F.

2. Cut the top of each onion in an X pattern about 1/2-inch deep.
Open the "petals" slightly with your fingers.

3. In a bowl, combine the butter, honey, mustard, and vinegar and
whisk until smooth. Add the paprika, cloves, salt, and pepper and mix
well. Place the onions in a casserole or baking dish. Make sure they
fit snugly, and will hold each other up in the dish. Pour the water
around them.

4. Spoon about 2 Tsp of the glaze over each onion, making sure some
gets into the petals you opened earlier. Bake for 30 mins, basting
often with the glaze. Add more water if it gets too low in the dish;
otherwise, the onions will dry out before they are cooked. Serve hot.
Makes 4 to 6 servings.
