Title: Jamaican Curry Goat "Caribbean Cooking for Pleasure"
Categories: Meats, Caribbean
Yield: 4 to 6
1    Onion; sliced
1 1/4 c  Stock
2    Chiles
- seeded and chopped
2    Potatoes, English
-peeled and diced
1 1/2 lb Goat or Mutton
- cut into 1 inch cubes
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper, freshly ground
1 tb Curry powder
1 oz Lard or cooking fat
Directions:

Season the meat with salt and pepper and curry powder, sifted
together and rubbed into the cubes. Set aside for 1 hour. Heat the
lard or fat in a saucepan, add the meat and onion and brown lightly.
Add the stock and chilies, cover and simmer over a low heat until the
meat is tender; the timing varies with the meat, mutton, which is
more often used for "curried goat", takes less time than goat. Add
the potatoes and continue cooking for a further 20 minutes or until
they are soft and the gravy thickens. Serve on a bed of rice.

=====================> Notes and Credits <=====================

This is almost a National Jamaican dish, eaten by many people at
least once a week, even the Ras Tafaris, the sect who follow the
Emperor of Ethiopia. The "Rastas" make very durable cooking bowls
from scrap aluminium, hand cast in sand. The aluminium is melted over
a charcoal fire, poured into a mould and plugged after it hardens.
Once can put these bowls on the fire and they stay hot for a long
time after removal, cold things stay cold and they can be hurled
around and never break.

Goat and mutton are the meats of the Jamaican people; in small
villages one may see a sign "Curried goat today" very much like "Fish
Frying" in some shop windows in England.
