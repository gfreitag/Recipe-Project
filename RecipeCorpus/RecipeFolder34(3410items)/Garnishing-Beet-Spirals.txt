The beet spiral makes an impressive decoration when used as a
centerpiece for a relish tray or when they are place don fresh
parsley and set at each corner of a meat entre and topped with a
radish rose. 1. To make the beet spiral, select beets which are oval
in shape.  Cut

the stem and root ends to creat flat surfaces.  Use the garnishing
knife around the outside of the vegetable to give the beet a ripple
edge. 2. Use the spiral slicer and with a moderate pressure, push the
point of the plastic screw into the core, or center, of the beet.
Give the vegetable a few turns to allow the screw to catch hold.
Once the screw has grabbed hold, place the beet securely in your left
hand (right hand if you are left handed) and with the other hand turn
the sprial slicer. Allow the spiral slicer to wind into the beet at
its own pace, do not apply pressure while turning. 3. After the
spiral slicer has sliced through about half way, hold the blade of
the slicer steady and turn the beet into the blade. This way you will
be able to slice completely through the beet. 4. Was the sliced beet
under warm water to remove the beet juice and interlock the two ends
of the beet sprial to form the decoration.  Place a radish rose on
top of the beet spiral for a finishing touch. Origin: The Fine Art of
