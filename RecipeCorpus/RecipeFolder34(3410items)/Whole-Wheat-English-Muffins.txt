Yield: 8 muffins
1 tb Brown sugar
3/4 ts Salt
1 ts Yeast
Cornmeal

2 tb Shortening

Place the first 8 ingredients in bread pan. Select dough cycle. When
cycle is complete, remove dough from machine. On a lightly floured
surface, cover dough and let stand for 10 minutes. Roll dough to
slightly less than 1/2 inch thick. Cut out muffins with a
4-inch-round biscuit cutter, rerolling scraps. Dip both sides of each
muffin into cornmeal. (If necessary, to make cornmeal adhere, lightly
brush muffins with water.) Cover and let rise in a warm place till
very light (about 30 minutes). (Or, do not let rise. Cover and
refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours.) Cook muffins 4 or 5 at a time in an
ungreased electric skillet at 325* for 25 to 30 minutes or until
bread sounds hollow when tapped with your fingers, turning every 5
minutes. (Refrigerate any remaining muffins for up to 8 hours before
cooking.) Or, cook over low heat on an ungreased large griddle or in
several skillets for 25 to 30 minutes, turning frequently. Cool
muffins thoroughly. To serve, split muffins horizontally and toast or
broil. Makes 8 or 9 muffins.
