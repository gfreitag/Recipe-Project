Preheat the oven to 300.  Lightly grease an 8" square pan.  Prepare

Spread aobut 2/3 of the brownie batter in the prepared pan.  Spread
the cream cheese filling over the brownie batter.  Using a spoon,
scoop the remaining brownie batter over the filling in nine equal

them.  Runa chopstick back and forth the length of the pan, making
parallel lines about 1 1/2" apart, then do the same thing in the
other direction as if making a grid.  Shake the pan gently back and

about 50 minutes.  Allow the brownies to cool for 1 hour before
cutting.
