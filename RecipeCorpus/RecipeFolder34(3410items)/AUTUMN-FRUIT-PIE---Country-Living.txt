Title: AUTUMN FRUIT PIE - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Desserts, Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 10 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
Pastry (recipe follows)
10    Granny Smith apples, peeled,
-cored, and thinly sliced
1 c  Pitted dates, chopped
1 c  Cranberries
1. Prepare Pastry.

2. Prepare filling: In 5-quart saucepot, combine apples, dates,
cranberries, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Heat to
boiling over medium heat, stirring frequently; continue cooking until
apples are soft but still retain their shape-about 20 minutes. Set
aside.

3. Heat oven to 400'F. Between 2 sheets of floured waxed paper, roll
out one ball of pastry to an 11-inch round. Remove top sheet of paper
and invert pastry into 9-inch pie plate, letting excess extend over
edge. Remove remaining sheet of waxed paper. Spoon apple filling into
pastry-lined plate.

4. Between sheets of floured waxed paper, roll out remaining pastry
to a 12-inch round to make top crust. Remove top sheet of paper and
invert pastry over filling. Remove remaining sheet of paper; gently
press pastries around rim where they meet. Carefully fold edge of top
crust under edge of bottom crust, making soft rolled border that is
even with rim of plate. Cut 4 slits in top crust to allow steam to
escape during baking.

5. Bake pie 30 to 35 minutes or until pastry is golden brown. Cool
pie on wire rack for 15 to 20 minutes before cutting.

Pastry: In medium-size bowl, combine 2 C unsifted all-purpose flour
and 1/2 t salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut 1/2 C (1 stick)
butter and 1/4 C vegetable shortening into flour mixture until
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle 4 to 5 T cold water over
flour mixture, 1 T at a time, and mix lightly until pastry holds
together when lightly pressed. Shape pastry into 2 equal balls;
flatten each ball to 1-inch thickness. Wrap and refrigerate pastry
for 30 minutes.
