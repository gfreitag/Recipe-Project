minutes before dipping apples.

sauce from bottom of apples.   Place on greased wax paper. Decorate
with candy if desired.

Serve immediately or store in refreigerator for up to two days. Let
stand at room temperature 15 minutes before serving to allow caramel
to soften.

Conventional method you would wash and dry apples; insert stick into

saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth.   Continue
as above.

For some variation you could substitute pears for apples.

water, roll in chopped peanuts.

Dip caramel coated apples in chopped nuts of flaked coconut.
