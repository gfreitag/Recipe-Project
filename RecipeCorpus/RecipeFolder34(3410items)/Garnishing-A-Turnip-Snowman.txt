The turnip snowman is a delightful garnish for the winter holudays.
It is also an easy one to make so let your imagination go.

1.  Wash and peel three turnips, each one just a bit smaller than the
other.  Cut the largest of the turnips to creat a flat surface.  At
the opposite end of the flat surface, push a toothpick halfway into
this turnip.

2.  Creat another flat surface on the middle suze turnip and secure
this turnip on the toothpick protruding from the large turnip.  Do
the same with the smallest turnip, securing it with another toothpick.

3.  Push whole cloves into the turnips for eyes, nose an dbuttons.
For the hat, cut a thin slice from the thick part of a carrot and
another thick slice from the tip of the carrot. Attach these two
pieces together and secure with a toothpick to the 'head'. Use a
strip of pimento or scallion leaf (parboiled) for the scarf.
