Title: BITTER MELON WITH EGGS
Categories: Vegetables, Filipino
Yield: 4 servings
6    Garlic clove; peeled
& minced
3 sm Tomato; peeled & chopped
3 lg Egg; lightly beaten
1/2 lb Bitter melon
1 tb Salt; plus 1/8 ts
1    Scallion
2 md Onion
4 tb Oil
Trim the pointed ends of the melons and then halve them the long way.
Scoop out the seeds and discard.  Cut the outer shells crosswise, on
the bias, into 1/4" wide strips.  In a bowl, stir one tablespoon salt
into two cups of water.  Put in the melon strips and let them soak
two hours, then drain, rinse under running water, and pat dry.

Slice the scallion into 2" lengths, then cut again lengthwise into
thin strips.  Peel the onions, halve them, and slice the halves to
make fine half-rings.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet over a moderate flame.  When the oil
is hot, add the garlic, and stir-fry until it is brown.  Add the
onions, and stir-fry for two minutes.  Add the tomatoes, and stir-fry
for another two minutes. Add the melon strips, and reduce the heat.
Fry for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the melon is tender.
Stir in the eggs and salt; cook as for scrambled eggs.  Remove from
heat, fold in the scallion strips quickly, and serve.
