Title: Basic Cooked Jerusalem Artichoke
Categories: Israeli
Yield: 6 servings
Fresh lemon juice
Salt and pepper
Jerusalem artichokes
Lightly salted water
Jerusalem artichoke, also known as sunchoke, is a seasonal vegetable
that looks a bit like fresh ginger, and tastes like a cross between
potatoes and artichokes.  We enjoy it very much in Israel.

To prepare jerusalem artichokes as a side dish, peel and cook in
boiling lightly-salted water for 1/2 to 1 hour, covered, until soft.

Add salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with lemon juice.
