Title: Bayrische Leberknoedelsuppe (Bavarian Liver Dumpling Soup
Categories: Aust/german, Soup/stew, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Milk; lukewarm
1/2 lb Liver
2    Eggs;lightly beaten
1 ts Dried marjoram
2 1/2 c  Beef stock
6    Stale crusty rolls;
-thinly sliced
2 oz Beef suet
1    Small Onion;
-coarsely chopped
1/2 ts Salt
Put the sliced rolls in a large bowl. Sprinkle them with salt and
pour over the lukewarm milk. Leave them to soak until required. Trim
the liver and put it through a meat mincer together with the suet and
onion. Add the soaked bread, the eggs and marjoram, and mix with a
wooden spoon until well blended. The mixture will be very soft. Bring
the stock to the boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and
simmer the stock. Divide the dumpling mixture into 8 portions. With
wet hands, shape a portion at a time into a ball and drop it into the
stock. Simmer gently for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the dumplings are
cooked through. Serve 2 dumplings per person in soup plates, together
with some of the stock.

Bavarian liver dumplings are almost as large as tennis balls. two of
them make an ample portion, served either in a well-flavoured stock,
or as a main course, garnished with fried onion rings and accompanied
by mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.
