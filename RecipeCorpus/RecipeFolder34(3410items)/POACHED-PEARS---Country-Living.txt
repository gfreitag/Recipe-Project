Categories: Country liv, Desserts, Fruit, Microwave
Yield: 4 servings
2    Whole cloves
4    Firm, ripe pears with stems
-intact, peeled and cored
-through bottom end
1 c  Cranberry-juice cocktail
1 c  Red wine
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Tangerine, quartered
1    Cinnamon stick
1. To make poaching liquid, in 1 1/2-quart microwave-safe bowl,
combine juice, wine, sugar, tangerine, cinnamon stick, and cloves.
Microwave on high (100 percent) to 2 minutes or until sugar dissolves.

2. Stand pears in poaching liquid, submerging each pear as much as
possible. Cover with waxed paper and microwave on high 5 minutes. Turn
pears, cover with paper, and microwave on high 5 to 6 minutes longer
or until pears are tender but still retain their shape. Let pears
stand in poaching liquid at room temperature 30 minutes. Refrigerate
pears in poaching liquid 1 hour, turning pears occasionally so they
color evenly.

3. To serve, stand each pear in a serving bowl. Strain poaching
liquid and ladle about 2 T liquid into each bowl.
