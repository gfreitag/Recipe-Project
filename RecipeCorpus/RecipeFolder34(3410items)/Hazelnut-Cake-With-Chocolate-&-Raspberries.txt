FOR CAKE: Preheat oven to 350F. Line 10x15-inch baking sheet with 3/4
inch high sides with parchment.  Butter parchment.  Process
hazelnuts, 2/3 cup sugar and flour in processor until nuts are finely
ground.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in large bowl
until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 2/3 cup sugar, beating
until stiff peaks form. Gently fold nuts into whites in 2 additions.
Fold in butter.  Spread mixture evenly in prepared pan.   Bake cake
until golden and slightly firm in center, about 16 minutes.  Cool.
(Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room
temperature).

FOR CHOCOLATE GANACHE: Bring cream to boil in heavy large saucepan.
Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until chocolate melts and
mixture is smooth.  Transfer to large bowl.  Chill until mixture is
cold and thick, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat chocolate mixture until firm peaks form.
Turn out cake onto work surface; peel off parchment.  Cut cake
lengthwise into 2 equal rectangles.  Place 1 layer on platter.
Spread cake with 1/3 of chocolate ganache.  Arrange 1 basketful
raspberries over ganache, spacing berries evenly.  Top raspberries
with 1/3 of chocolate ganache. Place second cake layer atop cream;
press gently to compact. Spread top and sides of cake decoratively
with remaining chocolate ganache. Refrigerate until firm, about 2
hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)

Sift cocoa powder over cake.  Cut cake into squares.  Place squares on
plates.  Spoon coulis around cake. Top coulis with whipped cream, if
desired.  Garnish with berries and mint.
