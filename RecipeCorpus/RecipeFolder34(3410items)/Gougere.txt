Title: Gougere
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
Freshly ground nutmeg
6    Eggs
2 c  Shredded Swiss cheese
1 tb Dijon nustard
1 1/2 c  Milk
8 tb Butter
1 1/3 c  Flour
Salt to taste
Tabasco to taste
This is a technique for choux-paste (cream puff) pastry.

Bring milk to a boil in a large saucepan and add butter to melt.
Remove from heat, add flour all at once and beat with a wooden spoon
until the batter comes away from the sides of the pan. Add salt,
Tabasco, and nutmeg to taste (probably no more than a teaspoon of
each). Beat the eggs into the batter one at a time, completely
incorporating one egg before adding the next. Stir in the cheese and
the mustard.

Preheat oven to 400.  Butter a cookie sheet.  Place a drinking glass
in the center;  this glass will be removed before baking.  It will
help retain a ring shape to the pastry. Drop batter by tablespoons
around the drinking glass in an expanding circle. You will get a
circular mass of batter about 10 to 12 inches across. Remove glass.

Bake in oven 15 minutes at 400, then reduce heat to 350 and bake
another 35 minutes.  Now here's the important part:  RESTRAIN YOUR
IMPULSE TO PEEK! NO MATTER HOW DELECTABLE IT SMELLS, DO NOT OPEN THE
OVEN DOOR!!!! LEAVE IT ALONE UNTIL THE COOKING TIME IS UP!  At the
end of the cooking time, gougere should be a beautiful puffed golden
brown. Turn off heat and leave in oven with door ajar for 5 minutes
after turning off.

Transfer to a round platter with a pretty paper doily and have your
guests slice it into thin wedges.  Serve with kir cocktails (Dry
white wine over ice with a splash of creme de cassis liqueur).
