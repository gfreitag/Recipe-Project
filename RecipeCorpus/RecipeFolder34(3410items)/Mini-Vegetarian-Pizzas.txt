Categories: Appetizers, Pizza
Yield: 28 servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 ts Salt
1 ts Dried oregano -- crushed
1/8 ts Pepper
2 c  Tomatoes -- chopped
1 c  Zucchini -- chopped
1/4 c  Green onions -- chopped
1    Clove garlic -- minced
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1/3 c  Norwegian crispbread --
Crushed
2 c  Jarlsberg cheese --
Shredded
Cornmeal (optional)
3 c  Flour
1 pk Fast-rising dry yeast
1 ts Salt
1 c  Water
2 tb Olive oil
FILLING Combine tomatoes, zucchini, green onions, garlic, and
seasonings in medium bowl.  Cover and chill until ready to use; drain
if necessary. TO PREPARE DOUGH Mix 2 cups flour, yeast, and salt in
large bowl. Heat water and oil in small saucepan until temperature
reaches 125 F. Stir into flour mixture along with crispbread crumbs.
Add only enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough.  Knead
on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
Cover; let rest 10 minutes in a warm place. Grease 2 baking sheets,
sprinkle with cornmeal, if desired. Preheat oven to 450 F.  Divide
dough in half. Roll out one half to 1/4 inch thickness. With 2 1/2
inch cookie cutter, cut out 14 rounds. Place on prepared baking
sheets.  Repeat with remaining dough. With fingers, press down gently
in middle of each round to make an indentation. Sprinkle 1 cup cheese
evenly over rounds.  Spoon about 1 tablespoon drained filling in each
center. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese. Bake 7 to 8 minutes
until cheese is melted and pizzas are heated through.
