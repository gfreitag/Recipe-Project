Categories: Israeli, Appetizers, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
2    Garlic cloves
3 tb Chopped parsley
2 oz Grated parmesan; 50 g
4 oz Ricotta; 100 g
Salt and pepper
1 lb Flour; 500 g
1 tb Olive oil
6    Eggs
1 pk Frozen artichoke hearts
;1 package = 400 g
Olive oil
Prepare pasta dough using the flour, olive oil, and eggs.  Let rest 1
hour, covered with a dampened cloth.

Cube the artichoke hearts.  Heat the olive oil in a skillet, add the
artichoke hearts, garlic and parsley, cover the skillet, and cook on
low heat 20 minutes.  Add a little water from time to time if
necessary. Cool 10 minutes, transfer to food processor with all the
other ingredients, and process until smooth.

Thinly roll the pasta dough, preferably using a pasta machine.  Cut
into 2" x 2" squares (6 x 6 cm), put a little amount of filling in
each square, close to one corner.  Fold the corner over the filling,
and roll into a tight cylinder.  Close the cylinder ends together to
form tortellini rounds.  Repeat with all the pasta squares.

Boil strained chicken soup in a large pan (use pareve stock base if
you wish, or clear vegetable broth).  Cook the tortellini in the soup
12 minutes.  Ladle into soup platters, sprinkle a little parmesan,
garnish with a little chopped dill and serve immediately.
