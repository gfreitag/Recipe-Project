1. Prepare Roasted Garlic; set aside. Prepare Lentil Puree; set aside.

2. In large skillet, heat 1 T  oil over low heat. Add carrot, squash,
zucchini, and leek; cook 7 minutes or until vegetables are tender.

3. In large bowl, mix together sauteed vegetables, grated potatoes,
Lentil Puree, thyme, 1/4 t salt, and the pepper until well blended.

4. Heat oven to 200'F. In 6-inch skillet, heat 1/4 inch oil over
medium heat. Drop 1 heaping cup of vegetable-potato mixture into oil
and flatten with a slotted pancake turner or spatula to make rosti.

5. Cook rosti until golden-about 10 minutes on one side. Cover
skillet with inverted plate; invert rosti onto plate and slide back
into skillet. Cook other side until crisp and golden-about 10 more
minutes. Transfer rosti to wire rack on baking sheet; keep warm in
oven while preparing remaining three rostis.

over low heat, While last rosti is frying, in large skillet, heat
about 1 t oil over medium heat. Add spinach and cook just until
wilted-about 2 minutes. Toss with remaining 1/4 t salt.

7. To serve, pour about 1/4 C Carrot Sauce onto each plate; place a
rosti on top. Divide spinach and remaining roasted garlic cloves
evenly among rostis.

Roasted Garlic: Heat oven to 375'F. With sharp knife, cut off tops of
2 large heads garlic. Peel some of loose outer skins from garlic.
Place garlic heads on small baking sheet and brush with about 2 t
olive oil. Bake garlic 35 to 40 minutes or until very tender. When
cool enough to handle, break cloves from heads of garlic and squeeze
from skin. With fork or back of a spoon, mash enough cloves to make
1/4 C; set aside for use in Carrot Sauce. Set aside remaining roasted
garlic cloves for garnish.

Lentil Puree: In medium skillet, heat 1 t olive oil; add 1/2 C finely
chopped onion and saute until tender. Add 1/4 C red lentils, 1 bay
leaf, and 1 C water. Cover and cook 20 minutes or until lentils are
soft. Remove bay leaf and drain. Mash lentils to make thick puree.
Set aside to cool.

Carrot Sauce: In 2-quart saucepan, heat 2 C carrot juice over medium
heat to boiling. Cook until reduced by half-about 25 minutes. Add 1/4
C mashed garlic (from Roasted Garlic), 2 tablespoons fresh lemon
juice, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. In food processor fitted with
chopping blade or blender at hiah speed, process or blend carrot
mixture until well mixed. Strain mixture, reserving sauce only, in
saucepan; keep warm.
