2 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 1/4 c  Buttermilk

2    Large eggs, lightly beaten
In large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt.  In small bowl or glass
measuring cup, combine buttermilk and baking soda.  Immediately add
buttermilk mixture, eggs, and melted butter to flour mixture.  Stir
just until dry ingredients are moistened. (Mixture should be lumpy.)

Lightly oil a griddle or 8-inch skillet and heat over medium heat.
Spread a heaping 1/2 cup of batter on griddle to make a 6-inch
flapjack. Cook until bubbles form and begin to break on top surface;
turn flapjack over and cook until bottom is golden brown.  Remove
flapjack and serve immediately or place on a baking sheet in 200F
oven to keep warm until all flapjacks are done.

Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to pan as necessary.
Serve flapjacks warm with butter, maple syrup and strawberries and
blueberries, if desired.
