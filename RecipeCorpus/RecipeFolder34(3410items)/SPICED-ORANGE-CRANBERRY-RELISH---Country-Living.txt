Title: SPICED ORANGE-CRANBERRY RELISH - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Relishes, Holiday
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
1 pk (12-oz) fresh cranberries
2/3 c  Sugar
1    Large navel orange
80    Whole cloves
1. With vegetable peeler, cut eight 2 1/2- by 1/4-inch strips of peel
(orange part only) from the orange. With small metal skewer, randomly
poke 10 holes about 1/2 inch apart over each orange-peel strip;
insert one clove into each hole.

2. With small knife, cut remaining white part, or pith, off the peeled
orange. Cut peeled orange into 1/2-inch cubes. If desired, wrap and
refrigerate a few cubes for garnish.

3. In food processor fitted with chopping blade, process cranberries
and sugar until coarsely chopped. Transfer cranberries to food-storage
container and stir in orange cubes and orange-peel strips. Cover and
refrigerate at least 1 day to allow cloves to permeate the berries.

4. Just before serving, remove the orange-peel strips, reserving 1 for
garnish, if desired, and transfer relish to serving dish. Garnish with
reserved orange cubes and an orange strip, if desired.
