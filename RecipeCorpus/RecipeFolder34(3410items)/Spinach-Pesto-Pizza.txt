1 1/2 c  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 c  (packed) Fresh Basil
1/2 c  Walnuts or Pine Nuts
Blend all pesto ingredients till fairly smooth Some pre-made pizza
crusts are better if you "toast" them in the oven. If this is so,
then toast your pizza crusts. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Wash &
remove all stems from spinach. Get the spinach as dry as possible.
Pile spinach on pizza crusts. Should be about an inch to an inch & a
half tall with spinach.

Drizzle at least 1/2 cup pesto onto spinach on EACH pizza, don't use
more than 3/4 cup pesto per pizza.

Spread mozzarella evenly on pizzas, then spread romano evenly on
pizzas. Bake at 400 degrees 8 to 12 minutes.

They are done when the mozzarella is bubbly & the romano is lightly
browned.
