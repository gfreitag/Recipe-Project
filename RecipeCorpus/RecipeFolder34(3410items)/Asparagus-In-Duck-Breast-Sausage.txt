Cut the bottom third of each asparagus sprig.  Poach the asparagus in
salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then transfer immediately to
iced water to stop the cooking and preserve the fresh green color.
Wrap each sprig with two sausage slices and seal with a toothpick.

Before serving, heat the olive oil with the garlic cloves in a large
skillet.  Slightly saute the wrapped asparagus for about a minute.
Remove from skillet, discard the garlic cloves.

Arrange nicely four asparagus sprigs on each plate, and serve
immediately.
