Often the combination of fruit with meat does not raise an eyebrow;
think, for instance, of roast pork and apple sauce, duck with orange,
or turkey with cranberries. When more unusual combinations are made,
however, they are often tried with some trepidation. This dish has
nevertheless proved a favourite, and although best made with fresh
blackberries, can also be made with frozen ones, or those canned in
natural juice. Serve with a green vegetable, such as french beans or
mangetout peas.

One serving has 300 calories and 11g fat. Preparation time 15 minutes
+ 30-45 minutes baking. Oven temperature Gas Mark 8/450F/230C Preheat
the oven, trim the fat and silvery skin from the beef. Brush with the
oil, season with pepper and roast in the oven for 30-45 minutes (rare
to medium rare). Remove the meat, wrap in foil and keep it warm.
Drain any fat from the roasting tin and add the beef stock. Stir
well, scraping all the meaty pieces from the base of the pan. Blend
the port with the cornflour, add this to the pan and stir until
thickened. Stir in the blackberries. Season to taste. Cut the meat
into thick slices and arrange it on a plate. Pour the sauce over it.
