Title: Coconut Rice
Categories: Side dish, Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Coconut milk -- unsweetened
Salt and pepper
2 tb Peanut oil
1 sm Onion -- diced
1 c  Long-grain rice
Preheat oven to 350.  In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium
high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and saute,
stirring frequently, until just transparent, about 5 minutes.  Add
the rice and continue to cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.
Add the chicken stock and coconut milk, bring to a simmer, and add
salt and pepper.  Cover the pan tightly, put it in the oven and bake
for about 18 minutes.  All the liquid should be absorbed and the rice
should be cooked through but not mushy.
