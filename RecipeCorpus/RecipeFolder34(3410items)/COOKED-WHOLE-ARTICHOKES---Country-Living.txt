Categories: Country liv, Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 2 servings
1    Bay leaf
1/4    Lemon
2    Globe artichokes
1/2 c  Water
1. Trim off stems of artichokes to their bases. Place artichokes on
their sides and cut off top one third of each. Stand artichokes,
stemmed sides down, in 3-quart microwave-safe dish that is at least
1/2- inch higher than trimmed artichokes. Add water and bay leaf to
dish and squeeze lemon all over; place lemon in dish.

2. Cover with lid or vented plastic and microwave artichokes on high
(100 percent) 8 to 10 minutes for medium size and 11 to 13 minutes
for large, or until center leaves come out easily when gently pulled.
(If microwave does not have carousel, rotate dish halfway through
cooking.) Discard lemon, bay leaf, and cooking liquid; serve
artichokes hot or refrigerate and serve chilled.
