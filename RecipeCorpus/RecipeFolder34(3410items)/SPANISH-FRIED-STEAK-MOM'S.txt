I don't know why Mom called it Spanish-probably the tomato. I like it
best thick, and with mashed, or baked potato it was so good. Enjoy.
Add shortening to large pan. Saute minced garlic. Dip pieces of meat
in flour, salt and pepper mixture. Fry in hot fat. Drop in kettle of
water (4 cups) and add remaining ingredients. When meat is done,
about 4 hours on low heat, it can be thickened with flour and water.
Adapts to Crockpot cooking.
