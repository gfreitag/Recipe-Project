Categories: Country liv, Fish/seafoo, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 lb Asparagus
1 1/2 tb Butter or margarine
2    Lemon wedges
2 tb Fresh lemon-thyme leaves
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Finely grated lemon rind
2 tb Lemon juice
2    Catfish fillets-about 6 oz
1. In shallow dish or glass pie plate, combine lemon-thyme leaves,
oil, lemon rind and juice, and salt. Add fish and coat with thyme
mixture. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour to marinate.

2. Meanwhile, cut or break off and discard woody ends of asparagus.
With vegetable peeler, peel lower part of each spear. Cut each spear
crosswise into 2-inch lengths. Separate the tips from the thicker
part of the spears.

3. Just before serving, in large skillet, melt 1 T butter over
medium- high heat. Add thicker part of asparagus and saute, tossing
with slotted pancake turner, until tender-crisp-3 minutes. Add the
asparagus tips and saute asparagus 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer
asparagus to a bowl, cover and keep wann. Reduce heat to medium.

4. Fold marinated fish crosswise in half. Add fish and its marinade to
skillet and cook 2 minutes. Turn fish over and spread top with
remaining 1/2 T  butter. Cover skillet and cook fish until firm and
flesh flakes easily-about 5 minutes. Return asparagus to skillet
around fish and garnish with lemon. Serve immediately.
