Title: Mulberry Pudding
Categories: Desserts, Fruit, British isl, Puddings
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------FOR THE SUET CRUST--------------------------
Water
1 lb SR flour
1/2 lb Freshly chopped suet
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
1 lb Mulberries
6 oz Sugar
Make the suet crust by mixing the suet and self raising flour with
just enough water to make a soft dough. Set aside about 1/4 of this
for the lid, and roll the rest out into a circle, large enough to
line a suitable sized basin.  Work fairly quickly as suet crust must
be steamed fairly soon after being mixed if it to be light.
Line the basin and fill the cavity with mulberries, interspersing
with sugar in the proportions given in the ingredients.
Cover with the remaining suet crust, then with greaseproof paper
and foil or cloth in your usual way. Boil or steam for 3 hours. Serve
with a proper egg custard or cream. Put a bowl of granulated sugar on
the table for extra sweetness if necessary, but mainly for that
agreeable grittiness that sets of this kind of pudding so well.
