Categories: Meats, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
Meat tenderizer
4 lb Leg of goat
Red wine
MMMMM------------------------ACHIOTE OIL-----------------------------
Ancho pepper
Olive oil
Annato seeds
Cut goats leg at the knee-bone, pierce meat several times, rinse in
water and sprinkle on meat tenderizer. Place meat in a bowl, cover
loosley and refigerate several hours.
About 2 hours before grilling, place meat in a large pot, add enough
water to cover; bring water to a boil and then lower heat and simmer
for about 10 minutes. Remove meat from water, place back in the bowl
and add about 2 cups red wine. Allow meat to soak in wine for 20-30
minutes. Discard water and wine.
While meat is in wine, place 1/2 cup or so of olive oil in a
skillet, add a few annatto seeds, and an ancho pepper (dried) or two,
unseeded. Heat oil and stir seeds until oil takes on the color of thr
annatto seeds, (orange). Keep heat low, allow oil to cool, and brush
over meat while grilling.
When grill is ready, cook meat about 10 minutes on one side, then 5
or so on the other, or until meat is done. Goat turns out fairly
tender. Submitted By PHILLIP WATERS   On   09-18-95
