Title: Herbal Hair Products You Can Make
Categories: Herbs/spice, Companion
Yield: 1 servings  The recipes that follow are flexible; they are meant to be
guidelines. One of the greatest advantages to making herbal hair
preparations at home is the opportunity to experiment and fine out
what works best for your own hair.  The accompanying chart suggests
some herbs to try.

Always make and store herbal hair preparations in nonreactive
containers; otherwise, you might find your hair turning an unexpected
hue.  I steep my herbs in an enamel bowl and store leftovers in the
refrigerator in a plastic shampoo bottle.  Before trying any new herb
concoction on your scalp, dab a bit of the preparation on the inside
of your elbow and cover it with a plastic bandage.  Wait for 24 hours
and then check for redness or itching.  If you don't see or feel any
allergic reaction, the preparation is probably safe to use on your
head.

** SHAMPOO: Herbs containing saponins that can be used for shampooing
hair include soapwort (Saponaria officinalis) and yucca (Yucca
filmentosa, Y. glauca). Soap-bark chips, which come from the Chilean
evergreen tree 'Quillaja saponaria' and are available from some
suppliers of herb products, are a good choice for oily hair.  All
have a gentle cleansing action.

Finely chop 2 tablespoons fresh or 1 tablespoon dried soapwort root or
leaves and stems, or substitute a similar amount of yucca roots or
soap-bark.  Add 1 cup warm water and agitate until suds form.  If
desired, use half the amount of water and add the sudsy solution to
an infusion made by steeping, then straining, a handful of other
herbs suited to your hair type (see chart below).

Massage the preparation into your scalp, about 1/2 cup for average
length hair; rinse with water and repeat soaping if necessary.  The
solution, odorless when fresh, may begin to ferment and smell
unpleasant in a few days, so make only enough to use up in a short
time.

Follow this shampoo with an herbal conditioning rinse (see below).

** CASTILE SHAMPOO: Make an herbal infusion by pouring 4 cups boiling
water over 5 tablespoons of the dried herb or herbs of your choice
(see chart), or use a couple of big handfuls of fresh herbs.
Chamomile flowers are often used for light hair, rosemary or sage for
brunettes.  Cover and steep for 30 minutes. Strain out solids, add 4
ounces of flaked or liquid castile soap, and stir.

This will make about 1 quart of shampoo, which will keep for a couple
of weeks in the refrigerator.  Follow it with the herbal conditioning
rinse below.

** CONDITIONING RINSE: Used after first rinsing out your shampoo with
plain water, this vinegar solution will neutralize the alkalinity of
castile or commercial shampoos, remove any hard water residue, and
leave hair feeling soft.  It's made up fresh for each shampoo.

Choose herbs for the conditioning effects appropriate to your hair
type (see chart below).  Infuse 2 tablespoons dried herbs, or a
couple of handfuls of fresh ones, in 4 cups boiling water.  Cover and
steep for 30 minutes, then strain well.  Add 1 tablespoon cider
vinegar.  Other vinegars can be used for the same acidifying effect,
but cider vinegar has a pleasant scent.

Pour this solution through hair over a basin or bowl to catch the
flow, then repeat the motion about 20 times.

** SETTING GEL: The familiar house plant 'Aloe vera' has a role in the
herbal hair salon. The gel from the freshly cut leaf serves as a
setting gel; it leaves hair shiny, dries quickly, and tames curly
hair.  Use the gel as you would any other setting gel, or try it as a
mousse, letting the aloe dry on the hair and then brushing as you
blow-dry.

** DRY SHAMPOO: In between shampoos, or when you are traveling or ill
or in a hurry, try this dry substitute.  Part off sections of your
hair in rows and sprinkle arrowroot powder on your hair and scalp.
Work it in with your fingers. Leave it on for a few minutes to absorb
hair oils, then brush hair thoroughly until it shines.
