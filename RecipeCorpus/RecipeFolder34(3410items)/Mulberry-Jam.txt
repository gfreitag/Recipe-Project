Title: Mulberry Jam
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit
Yield: 1 cup
Fresh lime juice
Sugar
4 c  Half-ripe (red to purple)
Mulberries
1/4 c  Water
Plce berries and water in a 1-1/2 qt saucepan, cover, and cook about
5 minutes, until berries are soft. Remove from heat, and taste for
acidity, adding lime juice as necessary. Cool a teaspoonful of the
juice to room temperature, and test for pectin *. Discard test
mixture without tasting. Add liquid pectin, 1 tablespoon at a time,
reteseting until you have the desired pectin level, and add sugar
accordingly before boiling the jam until it is thick. It need not set
like jelly. Ladle into hot, sterilized 8-oz jar, seal, cool, label
and refrigerate. Microwave Directions: Reduce the water in the first
step to 2 tablespoons. Microwave jam on high in a 2-qt microwavable
glass measure or casserole with vented cover about 5 minutes. Test
for acidity and pectin, and discard test mixture without tasting. Add
lime juice and sugar, and transfer to a range top pot for final
cooking because microwaving does a poor job of evaporating liquid
rapidly. Pack as above. *Test for Pectin:  Measure  into a small cup
a teaspoonful of rubbing alcohol and 1 teaspoonful of cooked juice
cooled to room temperature. Shake the cup gently to coat the juice
with the alcohol, and let stand 60 seconds. Then, pour the mixture
into a saucer. If a solid mass of gelatin occurs the pectin level is
too high, and you should use 1 cup of sugar for each cup of cooked
juice or fruit with its juice; if large, broken flakes of gelatin
form, you will need 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sugar of each cup of
unsweetened fruit or juice.
