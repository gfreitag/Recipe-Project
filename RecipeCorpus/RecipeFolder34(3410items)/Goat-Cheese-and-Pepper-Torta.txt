Although this torta is from Provence, its superb taste suggests a
Moroccan influence.  Choose a mild to mature chevre, depending on
your taste.  If goat cheese isn't to your liking, you can substitute
feta or a mild blue cheese.  The crisp texture of the green and red
peppers contrasts delightfully with the smooth spiced cheese.

DIRECTIONS: ========== Saute the onion in butter until soft. Place all
ingredients except peppers and garnishes in a food processor or
mixing bowl and blend thoroughly. Line a 3- to 4-cup mold with a
double thickness of cheesecloth.  Place the red pepper top upside
down in the bottom of the mold and sprinkle chopped red and green
pepper bits around it.  Cover with half the cheese mixture and level
the mixture with a spoon.  Sprinkle on the remaining pepper bits and
add the remaining layer of cheese.  Fold the cheesecloth over the top
and press it slightly to firm in place.  Let the mold set overnight
in the refrigerator.

To unmold, fold back the top of the cheesecloth.  Invert a serving
plate on top of the mold and flip them over together.  Lift off the
mold and carefully remove the cheesecloth.  Garnish the torta with
lettuce leaves and fresh cilantro.
