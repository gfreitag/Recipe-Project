uniformly dispersed in water. Heat to boiling over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until a thickened pudding forms. Remove pudding

small bowl. Lightly beat the yolks and whisk in some of the pudding,
then return yolk mixture to the saucepan of pudding, stirring until
well blended. Fold rhubarb into pudding. Return mixture to medium
heat and heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and
continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb softens-5
minutes.

3. Remove pudding from beat. Stir in lemon rind and juice; pour into
shallow 1 1/2-quart ovenproof bowl or casserole.

reserved egg whites and the cream of tartar until light and fluffy.
Gradually beat in remaining 1/2 C sugar until meringue forms stiff
peaks when beater is slowly raised. Spread meringue over pudding,
