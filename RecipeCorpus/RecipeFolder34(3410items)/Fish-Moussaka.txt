Categories: Main dish, Fish/seafoo, Israeli
Yield: 8 servings
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 tb Parsley; chopped
1    Egg
3 tb Tomato paste
2 tb Lemon juice
pn Caraway seeds
8    Fish fillets
1 1/2 c  Rice
1    Eggplant; large

1/2 c  Olive oil
Thaw fish, if using frozen fillets. Rinse and pat dry. Bring 3 cups
water to boil. Add rice, cover and simmer until done, about 20
minutes.

Peel the eggplants and cut into 1/2 cm slices. Sprinkle the eggplant
slices on both sides with salt, let them drain upright in a colander.
Meanwhile, mix together flour, salt and pepper, and cover the fish
fillets with the mixture. Heat the oil in a skillet, fry the garlic,
add the fish fillets and fry until done. Set aside on paper towels.
In the same oil, fry the eggplant slices until done. Drain on paper
towels.

Preheat oven to 260 C.

In a buttered dish, arrange the rice in a uniform layer. Layer the
fish over the rice, and the eggplant over the fish. Beat the egg with
3 tablespoons water, tomato paste, lemon juice, caraway, salt and
pepper. Pour over the dish, season with salt and pepper and garnish
with chopped parsley.

Bake 15 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.
