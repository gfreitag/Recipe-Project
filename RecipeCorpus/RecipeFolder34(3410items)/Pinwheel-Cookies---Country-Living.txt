Yield: 5 dozen
MMMMM------------------------COOKIE DOUGH-----------------------------
1/3 c  Sugar
1    Large egg
1/2 c  Honey
1 ts Lemon extract
2 1/2 c  To 2 1/4 C unsifted
-all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Butter, softened
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1    Large egg
1 ts Grated orange rind
1 1/2 c  Walnuts
1/2 c  Diced pitted prunes
1/4 c  Sugar
1. Prepare Cookie Dough: In medium-size bowl, combine 2 1/2 C flour,
the baking soda, and salt; set aside. In large bowl, with electric
mixer, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg,
honey, and extract.

2. Beat flour mixture gradually into butter mixture until soft dough
forms. With spoon, stir in enough additional flour to make dough
manageable. Wrap dough and refrigerate until well chilled-several
hours or overnight.

3. When dough is chilled, prepare Filling: In food processor, with
chopping blade, process walnuts until finely ground. Add prunes,
sugar, cinnamon, egg, and orange rind; process until mixture forms a
paste.

4. To shape cookies, divide dough in half. On lightly floured
surface, roll out half to an 8-inch square, about 1/4 inch thick.
Spread half of filling evenly over dough, leaving about 1/8 inch
around edges uncovered with filling. Roll up dough firmly and press
just the remain- ing edge, not the ends, to seal. Repeat with other
half of dough and filling. Wrap cookie rolls and refrigerate several
hours or overnight.

5. Heat oven to 350'F. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Unwrap rolls
and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place slices, 1 inch
apart, on greased sheets, reshaping slices into rounds.

6. Bake cookies 10 to 12 minutes or until firm. Cool on wire racks.
Store in airtight container.
