onion and garlic and cook for 1 min. Stir in the zucchini, eggplant,
and red pepper, sauteing until softened but not browned, about 5 mins.

5. Add the tomatoes and their juice, the basil, thyme, broth, cayenne,
salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, cover,
and cook until soft, about 15 mins.

6. Carefully pour the hot soup into a blender or food processor and
puree until smooth. Serve hot or chilled with a sprig of fresh basil
as a garnish.
