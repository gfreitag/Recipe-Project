1. Heat oven to 325'F. Prepare Tomato Pudding and Saffron Rice.

2. Meanwhile, grease a 9-inch square baking pan. Spread cheese under
the flap of flesh (the tenderloin) on the un- derside of the chicken
breast halves, replacing tenderloin to cover cheese. (If the
tenderloin is removed from the breasts cut a thin flap into the
underside of each breast to make a pocket for the cheese.) Place
breasts, cheese side down, into baking pan.

3. In small bowl, combine tarragon, salt, and garlic powder; sprinkle
tarragon mixture and 4 T butter over tops of chicken breasts. Pour
wine into baking pan. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until breasts are firm
to touch and cooked through.

4. Meanwhile, in large skillet, saute mushrooms in remaining 1 T
butter until golden. Fill mushroom-cap cavities with chopped olives.
During last 5 minutes of baking, place mushroom caps, olive side up,
into baking pan with chicken.

5. Just before serving, with sharp knife, make 4 partial crosswise
cuts through each chicken breast, leaving V4 inch at thicker edge
uncut. Spoon rice onto 4 serving plates. On each plate, fan out a
chicken breast over the rice. Place 3 stuffed mushrooms and spoon
some To- mato Pudding on one side of rice. Garnish plates with thyme
sprigs, if desired.

Tomato Pudding: In 1-quart casserole, combine tomatoes, white bread,
onion, celery, sugar, oregano leaves, salt, and ground black pepper.

peas, saffron threads, salt, and ground white pepper. Cover with
aluminum foil or lid and bake at 325'F for 45 minutes or until all
the liquid has been absorbed and rice is tender. Stir in butter or
margarine.
