Title: Green Bean Salad With Corn, Basil & Black Olives
Categories: Salads
Yield: 8 servings
-chopped
1 ts Garlic -- minced
1 c  Extra virgin olive oil
3 tb Balsamic vinegar
3 tb Lemon juice
3 ds Tabasco sauce
2 ts Salt
Fresh ground pepper
2 lb Green beans -- trimmed
3    Ears corn -- husked &
-desilked
1/2    Red bell pepper -- diced
1 sm Red onion -- diced
1/2 c  Cured black olives --
-chopped
1/3 c  Basil leaves -- finely
Put a huge pot of water on the stove over high heat and fill your
other largest pot half full of ice water.  When the water on the
stove comes to a rolling boil, add about half the green beans and
blanch for 2 minutes. Remove the beans and immediately plunge them
into the ice water.  Allow water to return to boil, then repeat with
the second half of the green beans.  Refill the pot with fresh water
and bring to a boil.  Add the ears of corn and blanch for about 1 to
2 minutes--the corn should still be crisp.  As soon as the corn is
cool enough to handle, cut the kernals off the cobs.  In a large
bowl, combine the beans, corn and all the remaining ingredients and
toss thoroughly.  This salad will keep, covered and refrigerated, for
about 3 days.
