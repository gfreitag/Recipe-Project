1. For the best flavor, cheeses should be served at cool room
temperatures. Cheeses should be removed from the cooler or
refrigerator an hour before serving.

2. Arrange cheeses in groups on wooden boards. Provide sharp thin
knives for cutting firm cheeses such as Cheddar, a cheese plane for
cutting Muenster into thin slices, and butter knives for soft cheeses
such as Bel Paese or Brie. Stand mozzarella cheese sticks up in a C .

3. Arrange fruit in a bowl and crackers in a bucket, if desired. Cut
apples and pears when ready to serve with cheeses.
