The Amount of Fish to Purchase

In general a serving equals 1/3 to 1/2 pound of edible fish. The
amount to buy depends upon the form in which the fish is purchased.
Allow one pound of whole fish per person, 1/2 pound of dressed fish
per person, 1/3 pound of steaks and fillets per person, and 1/3 pound
of breaded fishsticks or portions per person.  These figures, of
course, are only guidelines and can be adjusted according to the
eating habits of your family and friends.
