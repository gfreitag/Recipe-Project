-Note)
3 md Tomatoes
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
6    Large eggs
Fresh thyme sprigs (opt.)
Potato Pancakes
-(recipe follows)

12    Pork hangers (Irish

6    Slices Irish bacon
1    8-oz pk White Breakfast

1. Heat oven to 200'F. Prepare Potato Pancakes and place on large
ovenproof platter; keep warm in oven while preparing re- maining
ingredients,

2. In large skillet, heat just enough oil to thinly coat bottom of
skillet over low heat. Add hangers, arranged in a single layer, and
cook, turning frequently, until browned on all sides. Remove hangers
to oven platter with Potato Pancakes. Add bacon to skillet and fry,
turning frequently, until done. (Irish bacon does not become crispy
when cooked; it has the texture and color of smoked ham.) Remove
bacon to platter in oven. Add breakfast pudding rounds to skillet and
cook, turning, until firm and browned on cut sides; remove to oven
platter.

3. Cut tomatoes crosswise in half; sprinkle with 1/8 t salt and 1/8 t
pepper. Fry tomatoes, cut sides down, in skillet until lightly
browned (do not overcook; tomatoes should retain their shape). Remove
to oven platter.

4. Just before serving, fry eggs, in batches, sunny-side up or as
desired; transfer to platter and top with remaining salt and ground
pepper. Garnish platter with fresh thyme, if desired, and serve
immediately.

Potato Pancakes: In 4-quart saucepan, cover 4 medium baking potatoes
with water and heat to boiling; cover and cook potatoes 25 minutes or
until fork-tender. Drain potatoes and cool until easy to han- dle.
Peel potatoes and mash in bowl with 1/4 C (1/2 stick) butter. Stir in
1/2 C unsifted all-purpose flour, 1 large egg, 1 T chopped fresh
parsley leaves, 1 T chopped fresh chives, 1 t salt, and 1/2 t ground
black pepper; mix until well blended. In large skillet, heat 2
tablespoons vegetable oil over medium heat. Shape potato mixture into
twelve 2 1/2-inch patties and fry, in batches, until golden brown on
both sides, adding more oil as necessary. Serve immediately or keep
warm until serving.
