Categories: Breads, Tasteofhome
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
2 tb Butter
2/3 c  Buttermilk
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Warm water
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1.  In small bowl combine yeast, sugar and water; let stand until
bubbly, about 15 minutes.

2.  In a large bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and salt. Cut
in butter to make a fine crumb.

3.  Beat in yeast mixture and buttermilk to make a moderately stiff
dough. (Add more flour if necessary.)

4.  Knead dough lightly for a few seconds on floured board.

5.  Pat out to 1/2 inch thickness.  Cut dough with a 2-inch floured
biscuit cutter.

6.  Arrange biscuits in a greased baking pan so they barely touch each
other; prick tops with a fork.

7.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled (about 30 - 40 minutes)

8.  Bake at 425 F. for 10 - 15 minutes or until golden.  While
biscuits are hot from the oven, rub tops with additional butter.
