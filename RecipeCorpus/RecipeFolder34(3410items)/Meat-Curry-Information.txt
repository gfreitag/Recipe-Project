Beef and lamb are both good meats to curry, allowing the flavours to
penetrate very well. Pork and veal are less successful because of the
close textured meat. Traditionally meat is left on the bone as the
sauce flavour is improved by the bone marrow. Also in India where
food is often eaten with the fingers, it's easy to hold the bone and
nibble the meat from it. This means that you can use some of the
cheap cuts of lamb such as scrag end.

All types of flavouring can be used with meat, from chilli-laden
vindaloos to sweet tasting curries garnished with pineapple.
