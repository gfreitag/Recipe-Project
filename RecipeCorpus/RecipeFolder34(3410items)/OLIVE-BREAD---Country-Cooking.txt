Title: OLIVE BREAD - Country Cooking
Categories: Country coo, Breads
Yield: 1 loaf
1/3 c  Pitted, chopped oil-cured
-ripe olives
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Salt
Boiling water
3    To 3 1/2 C unsifted bread
-flour
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 tb Sugar
1 c  Warm water (115-F to 120-F)
1. In large bowl, combine 1/2 C flour, the yeast, and sugar. Add the
warm water; stir to blend and let stand 10 minutes or until surface
is bubbly. Add olives, oil, salt, and 2 C remaining flour; stir until
well combined,

2. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough, adding
remaining flour if necessary, until dough is smooth and elastic-about
10 minutes. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in
oiled bowl, turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth;
let dough rise in warm place until double in size-about 1 hour.

3. Lightly oil large baking sheet. When dough has doubled, roll out
to 12 by 8-inch oval. Starting from long side, roll edge of dough
over 1 turn, pinch to make a tight seam. Continue rolling dough,
pinching seam with each turn, to form a 12-inch-long roll. Pinch
edges and ends tightly to seal. Gently pull and taper ends of rolled
dough. Place loaf on oiled baking sheet; cover loosely with clean
cloth and let rise in warm place, until double in size-about 40
minutes.

4. Heat oven to 400'F. Place deep roasting pan on bottom rack of
oven; fill with 1 inch boiling water to create steam for baking
bread. When loaf has doubled, brush top with additional warm water;
make three 1/2-inch-deep slits on top. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until
lightly browned and bread sounds hollow when tapped on top. Cool on
wire rack at least 15 minutes before serving.
