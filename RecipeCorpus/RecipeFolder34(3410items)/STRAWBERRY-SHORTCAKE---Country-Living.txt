1. Prepare Chocolate-Covered Strawberries, if desired.

2. Prepare Biscuits: Heat oven to 350'F; lightly grease baking sheet.
In medium-size bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and
cinnamon. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut shortening into flour
mixture until mixture resembles fine crumbs. With fork, stir in milk
until just blended and dough forms a ball.

3. Divide dough in half. Pat each half out on lightly floured surface
to make a 3-inch heart about 1/2 inch thick. If desired, trim with
3-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter or knife to make edge perfect.
Place hearts on baking sheet and bake 20 to 25 minutes or until
golden brown. Cool on wire rack to room temperature.

4. Meanwhile, prepare Strawberry Sauce: In small saucepan, heat sugar,
water, and strawberries to boiling over low heat; simmer 20 minutes.
Strain and discard strawberries, reserving sauce. Set sauce aside to
cool.

5. Prepare Ganache: In small saucepan, heat cream just until hot. Stir
chocolate into hot cream until melted. Set aside to cool.

6. To serve, on 2 dessert plates, spoon enough strawberry sauce to
cover bot- toms. Split both biscuits in half. On bottom halves,
spread layer of Ganache; top Ganache with whipped cream and biscuit
tops to make shortcakes. Place shortcakes in center of sauce on
plates. If desired, sift confectioners' sugar over biscuits. Garnish
each with 5 Chocolate-Covered Strawberries and, if desired, mint
leaves.

Chocolate-Covered Strawberries: Line a small tray with waxed paper.
In top of doubler boiler or small heatproof bowl set over simmering
water, melt 3 1-oz squares semisweet chocolate. With small knife,
remove stems from 5 large strawberries. Slice strawberries 1/4 inch
thick; select 10 large slices. Use remaining slices as part of sliced
strawberries in . step 4. Pat the 10 slices dry with paper towel and
carefully dip one side of each halfway into melted chocolate. Place
covered strawberries on tray and refrigerate at least 15 minutes to
set chocolate.
