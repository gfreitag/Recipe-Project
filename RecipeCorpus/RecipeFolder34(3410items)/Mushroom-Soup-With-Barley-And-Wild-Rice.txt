mins. Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper, and sage. Cook until the
mushrooms have softened.

2. Add the Madeira and reduce by half over high heat. Stir in the

and simmer, covered, for 50 mins, or until the rice is tender. Serve
garnished with sliced raw scallions.

from the solids and refrigerate separately. Otherwise, all the liquid
will be absorbed into the grains. When ready to serve, combine the
broth and mushroom-grain base, heat, and serve.
