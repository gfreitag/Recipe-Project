Pepper to taste
1 c  Dried cannellini beans,

In a heavy saucepan, slowly simmer beans covered with salted water
until just tender. Cooking time depends on the age of the beans,
about 25 minutes. Add additional water if needed. Do not stir beans.
If there is any liquid left when the beans are done, pour it off and
reserve.

In a saucepan, barely cover tomatoes with reserved bean water or tap
water, add oil and garlic and simmer until tomatoes are puffed and
softened, but keep their shape. Gently fold cooked tomatoes, sage
leaves and pepper into beans. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Serves 2 as a main course; 4 as an appetizer or salad.
