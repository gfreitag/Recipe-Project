Title: Israeli Tahini Dip
Categories: Israeli, Appetizers, Dips/spread
Yield: 1 servings
3    Garlic cloves, minced
pn Cumin (optional)
Fresh parsley, chopped
- (optional)
3/4 c  Raw tahini
Juice of 3 lemons
1/3 c  Lukewarm water; as needed
1 ts Salt
"This dip should be made using a big bowl and a wooden spoon. A good
tahini dip develops its taste slowly, and the wonderful aroma won't
be developed if all the ingredients are added to it at once."

Put the raw tahini with the lemon juice in a bowl, and mix until
well-blended and light in color. Add a little water, and mix until the
mixture is still thick but does not stick to the sides of the bowl.
The mixture should still be somewhat stiff in this stage. Gradually
add the garlic, while mixing, then the salt and the cumin. Add water,
as needed, and mix until the desired thickness is reached. Garnish
with chopped parsley and serve immediately, with pita bread.

This dip is best prepared just before the meal. If prepared ahead,
store in fridge and bring to room temperature before serving.

GREEN TAHINI DIP: Add another 1/3 cup water and 2 cups finely chopped
fresh parsley.

UNUSUAL CALIFORNIAN-STYLE TAHINI DIP: Add 1/3 cup soy sauce, and 1/2
cup each of finely chopped fresh parsley, basil, and cilantro.
