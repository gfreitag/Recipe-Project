-45 to 60 minutes.  Strain
-off the
Liquid, put the coconut in
-a muslin bag, and squeeze
-to extract as
Much liquid as possible.
-This is called the thick
-or first milk.
The same process is
-repeated, but this time
-the strained coconut is
Soaked for 12 hours, and
-then strained again.  This
-is called the
Second milk.  The second
-milk is used for cooking
-the curry instead
Of stock or water, and the
-first or thick milk, is
-stirred in at the
Last moment to give a
-bland, lovely, flavor and
-texture to the
Curry.
A number of recipes that
-you will come across,
-especially ones from
Southern India, Ceylon
-(Sri-Lanka), and
-Indonesia, use coconut milk
As a stock.  Before trying
-out these recipes, it is
-important to
Understand what is meant by
-coconut milk.  The liquid
-in the coconut
We call milk, is called
-"water" and discarded in
-some places, and
Used for drinking in
-others.  To make the milk
-used in curries,
Remove the nut from its
-hard fibrous shell, scrape
-off the brown,
Inner skin.  Grate the
-coconut, finely, into a
-bowl, cover with 1/2
pt Of boiling water, leave for
Coconut milk can also be made from the dried (unsweetened) coconut.
Take 8 Ounces desiccated coconut, cover with 2 1/2 cups of boiling
water, leave for 24 hours.  Strain and use it in the same way as the
milk made from freshly grated coconut.  This can be substituted for
both the thick and second milk mentioned in recipes, although it will
not be as rich as the first milk made with fresh coconut. From How To
