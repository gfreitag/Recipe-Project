Title: Naan Bread #2
Categories: Breads, Indian
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Oil
1 tb Honey -- or sugar
2 1/2 c  Flour
Butter -- melted (opt)
Garnishes *
1 c  Flour
1 pk Yeast -- dry
2 ts Salt
1 c  Water -- hot
1 c  Buttermilk -- or yogurt
1    Egg -- (room temp)
*  If desired, you can use cornmeal or sesame or poppy seeds on the
bread.

Combine 1 cup flour, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl.  Stir in water,
buttermilk, egg, oil and honey. Beat until smooth with an electric
mixer. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft, sticky dough.
Turn onto a floured surface, continue to work in flour until dough is
stiff enough to knead.  Knead until smooth and elastic, but still
soft (3 to 5 minutes). Place in an oiled bowl; turning once to coat
top of dough. Cover; let rise until double in bulk (about 45
minutes). Punch dough down. Shape into 16 equal balls.  Let rest 5
minutes. Roll out each ball to a 1/4-inch thick round. If desired,
brush with melted butter and sprinkle with garnishes. Set on baking
sheets. Bake at 450 degrees F. for 5 to 8 minutes. NOTE: There is no
second rising in this recipe so that you get flat loaves.
