Shredded

In a large skillet bring 1 in. of water to boiling. add sweet
potatoes; reduce heat. coverand simmer for 20 min. or till tender.
Drain well. Meanwhile, for sauce, in a small bowl combine orange
peel, orange juice, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and allspice. pour
over potatoes in skillet. Cook and stir gently till bubbly. Simmer
uncovered, for 5 min or until potatoes are glzed, spooning sauce over
potatoes occasionally.

Notes:

I tend to steam the potatoes instead of putting them in the water in
the skillet. It keeps the potatoes firmer. Great food for the sweet
tooth.
