With sharp knife, cut a 1/2 inch thick slice from top of onion.  With
melon-ball cutter or tip of a paring knife, scoop out onion, leaving
a 1/2 inch thick shell.  Reserve 1/4 cup scooped-out onion.  Wrap and
freeze leftover scooped onion and onion slice for other recipes.

If desired, cut a scallop design around the top edge of onion shell.
Wrap shell with plastic wrap; refrigerate.

In food processor with chopping blade, process reserved onion until
finely chopped.  Add cheese, butter, 4 tablespoons milk, and pepper
saauce; process until smooth, stopping frequently to scrape the side
of the container.  If mixture is very stiff, add remaining milk and
process cheese mixture until soft and spreadable.  Stir in parsley
until well mixed.

Cover and refrigerate cheese spread at least 1 hour to blend flavors.
Just before serving, let cheese spread stand at room temperature
until soft enough to spoon.  Fill onion shell with as much cheese
spread as possible, replenishing when necessary.  Place filled onion
shell on serving plate and surround with crackers or crispbreads, if
desired.
