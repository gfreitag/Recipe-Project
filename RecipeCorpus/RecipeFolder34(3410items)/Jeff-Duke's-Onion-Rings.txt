Title: Jeff Duke's Onion Rings
Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers, Side dish
Yield: 2 servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
Oil for deep-frying
2 lg Yellow onions
1 qt Buttermilk
2 c  Unsalted cracker meal
Slice the onions and make rings approx. 1/2 inch in width.

Dip into buttermilk, then coat with the flour.  Dip into buttermilk
again, then coat with the unsalted cracker meal.

(works best if you use the "wet hand, dry hand" method)

Place rings onto wax paper.  Separate layers with additional sheets
of wax paper.

Best if allowed to refrigerate overnight to allow batter to "set".

Deep fry until golden-brown.  Salt if desired at serving time.

Enjoy! - Jeff Duke
