1    3 1/2-lb leg of lamb, shank

hours at room temperature, or 24 hours in refrigerator.

Bake lamb, with marinade, in the middle of a preheated 375'F oven
until the interior temperature is at least 125'F (rare), or 140'F
(medium), and skin is golden all over, about 1 hour and 5 minutes to
1 1/2 hours.

Remove pan from oven and let meat rest for 20 minutes before serving.
