Nigella seeds
Fenugreek seeds
Cumin seeds
Black mustard seeds
Fennel seeds
This spice blend in Bengal, in eastern India, consists of whole seeds
of cumin, black mustard, fennel, nigella, and fenugreek in equal
amounts.  If you aren't accustomed to Indian spice mixtures, you
might want to start with a smaller proportion of fenugreek -- perhaps
one-third as much as the other spices -- because in large quantities
it adds a bitterness that some people find unpleasant.  This blend is
not ground, but is heated in ghee or oil just before using to release
the flavors of the seeds.  The dry seeds can be stored for at least
four months in an airtight container away from light and heat.
