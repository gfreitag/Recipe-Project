Title: Everybody's Macaroni and Cheese
Categories: Newspaper, Pasta/rice, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Dijon-style mustard
1 1/4 c  Cheddar cheese; grated
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
1 c  Ham; cubed
2 c  Macaroni noodles; uncooked
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Flour
1 c  Milk
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the macaroni and cook until
tender.  While the macaroni cooks, grate the cheese (if necessary)
and then melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan.  Add the flour
and cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 1 minute as the
mixture forms a paste.  Add the milk slowly, stirring constantly, and
cook for 3 minutes until the milk thickens slightly.  (You will have
a few lumps. Ignore them.)  Add the mustard and all of the cheese,
stirring until it melts. Remove the sauce from the heat until the
noodles are done.

When the noodles are just tender, remove them from the heat and drain
thoroughly.  Pour the drained noodles into a pan with the cheese
sauce and stir to mix well.  Add the ham or other toppings/additions
and stir. Salt and pepper to taste.  Serve at once.
