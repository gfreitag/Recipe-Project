MMMMM-------------------------PASTA-----------------------------------
-Coarsely Chop
3/4 lb Linguini
1 c  Pasta Cooking Water,
-Reserved
1/4 c  Pecorino Romano -- finely
-grated
1 tb Kosher Salt
2/3 c  Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
6    Garlic Cloves, Peel
& Cut In Thin Slivers
1 ts Red Pepper Flakes -- dried
1 lb Spinach, Stemmed, Clean,
1. Combine topping ingredients in a small bowl and reserve.

2. In a large pasta pot, bring 4 qts. of water to a boil and add 1 Tbs
salt. Preheat the broiler.

3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and garlic over a low
flame. Cook the garlic slivers until they turn a light golden brown.
This should be a slow process in which the oil becomes infused with
the garlic's fragrance. When the slivers are golden, remove them with
a slotted spoon and discard. (Some cooks claim the garlic should be
left in the dish. We disagree.)

4. Add the red pepper flakes to the oil and cook approximately 30
seconds to impart their warmth to the oil. Toss the spinach in the
oil and cook until limp, turning often with tongs or a kitchen fork.
Remove the pan from the heat and reserve until pasta is done.

5. Plunge the pasta into the boiling water and cook until al dente.
Just before draining the pasta, ladle 1 cup of its cooking water into
the spinach and oil and place over moderate heat. Drain the linguine
and sprinkle the cheese directly onto the steaming pasta. Add the
linguine to the pan with the spinach and oil and toss well. Transfer
the pasta to an ovenproof serving platter and sprinkle with the bread
crumb mix. Broil until the crumbs are golden brown and serve
immediately.
