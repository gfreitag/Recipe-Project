Title: Pappamia's Pine Nut Crusted Snapper
Categories: Newspaper, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
5 tb Butter
2 ts Garlic; finely chopped
1/4 lb Bay scallops
1/2 c  Roma tomatoes; seeded & dicd
1/4 c  Dry chardonnay
8    Basil leaves; julienned
1/4 c  Pine nuts  (pignolia)
1 c  Bread crumbs
2 tb Parmesan cheese; grated
Salt & white pepper to taste
1/2 c  Flour
2    Eggs; beaten
4    Snapper fillets; 8oz each
Coarsely chop the pine nuts in a food processor.  In a medium-size
bowl, combine the pine nuts with the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese,
salt and pepper.  Place the flour in a large plate and place the eggs
in another medium-sized bowl.  Dust the fillets with the flour, dip
in the eggs, and then dip in the pine nut mixture.

Melt 3 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add the
fillets and fry until the centers of the fillets flake easily with a
fork, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  When the fillets are done,
arrange them on a large platter and keep them warm while preparing
the sauce.

In the same skillet, briefly saute the garlic; add the scallops and
tomatoes, then season with salt and pepper.  Add the wine and bring
to a full boil.  Cook until the liquid is reduced by half.  Add the
basil and stir in the remaining 2 Tbsp butter.  When the butter is
melted, remove from the heat.  Spoon the sauce over the snapper or
serve on the side. **  Houston Chronicle - Food section - 9 August
