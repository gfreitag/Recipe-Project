1. In a 8- or 12-qt stockpot over medium heat, combine the butter,
onions, green onions, green pepper, garlic, parsley, pork, chicken,
and ham. Cook, stirring, until meat and vegetables are lightly
browned, about 5 mins.

2. Add the cayenne, chili powder, bay leaves, thyme, cloves, cumin,
allspice, salt, and pepper. Cook another 5 mins, stirring frequently.
Add the sausage and cook for 5 to 10 mins more.

3. Add the stock and rice, bring to a boil, then turn the heat down
and cook for 40 mins, uncovered. Add the shrimp during the last 10
mins. Continue to stir frequently, pulling the ingredients up from
the bottom of the stockpot. When the shrimp are coral color, the
Jambalaya is ready to serve. Serve in heated bowls, with cayenne
pepper and Tabasco on the table to "hot it up," as Louis said. Makes
about 8 servings.
