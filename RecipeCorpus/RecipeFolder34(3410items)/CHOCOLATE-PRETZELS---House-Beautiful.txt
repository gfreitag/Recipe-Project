MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
6 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
-chocolate, chopped into
-small pieces
1 c  Confectioners' sugar
1/3 c  Plus 1 T coffee or water
1 ts Solid vegetable shortening
1 ts Light corn syrup
MMMMM-------------------------DECORATION------------------------------
1 1/2 oz White chocolate, melted
1    To 2 T coarse crystal
-sugar (opt.)
Make dough: In a medium bowl sift together flour, cocoa, baking
powder and salt; set aside.

In another medium bowl beat butter until light and fluffy. Add sugar
and corn syrup and beat until well blended. Add eggs and vanilla and
beat until smooth. Blend in half the dry ingredients. Stir in ground
walnuts and chocolate. Vigorously stir in remaining dry ingredients
until well blended.

Divide dough in half and wrap each half in a sheet of plastic wrap.
(Do not use waxed paper; the dough may stick to it.) Shape each half
into 6-inch log. Wrap tightly and chill 1 hour, or until dough is
chilled but not stifF

Working with 1 dough portion at a time, carefully mark and then cut
the log into 12 equal sections. To form pretzels, knead each section
briefly to soften it slightly, then roll it back and forth on a clean
work surface with your fingers to produce an evenly thick "rope"
slightly thicker than a pencil and 10 to 12 inches long. Gently place
each rope on a greased baking sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart. Cross
ends over one another, pretzel-fashion, and twist the rope at the
crossing point. Repeat the process until all 12 pretzels are formed.
Repeat with the second half the dough.

Bake in the center of a preheated 350'F oven 9 to 11 minutes, or until
edges are just beginning to brown. Remove and let stand 1 to 2
minutes. Using a spatula, transfer pretzels to wire racks set over
waxed paper to cool completely.

Prepare the glaze: Sift confectioners' sugar into a heavy medium
saucepan. Add coffee, shortening and corn syrup, and bring to boil
over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate until melted
and smooth.

Using tongs, dip pretzels 1 at a time, into glaze and coat
completely. (If glaze becomes too thick while you are working, it can
be thinned with a few drops of water or coffee.) Shake off excess
glaze and place, right side up, on wire racks to drain, being sure
not to let them touch. Sprinkle with coarse sugar crystals, or when
glaze sets, drizzle lightly with white chocolate.

Let pretzels stand 5 minutes. Then carefully lift and reposition them
so they don't stick to the rack. Let stand until the glaze is
completely set, about 30 minutes.

Pretzels may be stored up to 3 days, or frozen unglazed, then thawed
completely and glazed prior to serving, if desired. Makes 2 dozen
3-inch pretzels.
