Categories: Country liv, Main dish, Poultry, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
1 tb Cider vinegar
1/4 c  Calvados
1 c  (1/2 pint) heavy cream
Rosemary sprigs
2 lg Rome Beauty apples, peeled,
-cored, and cut into 1/4
-inch-thick slices
4    1/4-lb quail
1 tb Butter, softened
1. Place 1 rosemary sprig and a slice of apple in body cavity of each
quail. To truss, tie butcher's twine around each bird to hold wings
against breasts. With ends of same twine, tie legs together.

2. Heat oven to 375'F. Place trussed quail in roasting pan, breast
sides up. Rub tops and sides of quail with butter. Season with salt
and pepper. Roast until well browned, legs are loose when gently
moved, and cooking juices are no longer pink-about 20 to 30 minutes.

3. Remove twine from quail; keep quail warm on serving platter.
Strain pan drippings into large skillet. Heat drippings; add
remaining apple slices and cook, stirring occasionally, until
tender-crisp and lightly browned. With slotted spoon, remove apples
to serving platter with quail and keep warm.

4. Add vinegar to skillet and cook until most of the liquid
evaporates. Add calvados and cook until most evaporates Add cream and
a sprig of rosemary; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened
enough that sauce coats a metal spoon. Strain sauce through fine
sieve into serving bowl; spoon some over apples. Garnish platter with
rosemary sprigs, if desired. Serve immediately.
