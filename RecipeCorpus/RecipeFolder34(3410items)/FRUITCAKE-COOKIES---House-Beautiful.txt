1/3 c  Bourbon whiskey
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
3/4 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground ginger
In a large, deep non-aluminum mixing bowl combine candied citrus
peel, dark raisins, mixed fruits and bourbon. Cover and refrigerate
overnight, stirring several times.

In medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda,
cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg, set aside.

In another large bowl beat butter until fluffy. Add brown sugar and
molasses and beat until smooth. Beat in egg, egg yolk and orange
zest. Stir in half of the dry ingredients. Stir in fruit mixture and
chopped pecans, alternately with remaining dry ingredients. Cover and
chill at least 1 1/2 hours, or until firm enough to shape into balls.
(Dough may be refrigerated up to 48 hours.)

Form dough into 1-inch balls and place on greased baking sheets,
spaced about 1 1/2 inches apart. Place a pecan half on each ball and
press down slightly.

Bake in center of a preheated 375'F oven 9 to 10 minutes, or until
balls feel almost firm when gently pressed on top. Remove from oven
and let stand 2 to minutes. Using a spatula, transfer balls to wire
racks to cool completely. For best flavor, allow balls to "ripen" 24
hours before serving. Store in airtight container 3 weeks or freeze
up to 1 month. Makes about 5 dozen cookies.
