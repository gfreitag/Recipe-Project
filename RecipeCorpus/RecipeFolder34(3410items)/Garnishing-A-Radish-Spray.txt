A radish spray works beautifully in any flower arrangement.  This
bloom can also be colored to make a mixed bouquet, which is very
impressive.

1.  To make this flower, select a well tapered white radish.  HOld the
vegetable with the stem end toward you.  Use the small knife and make
thin slices from the root end to (but not through) the stem end.

2.  Hold the lengthwise strips together and give the radish a quarter
turn. Cut another series of lengthwise strips across the first cuts.

3.  Place the cut radish in ice water for 5 minute to bloom.  To
color this bloom add a few drops of food coloring to the ice water.
