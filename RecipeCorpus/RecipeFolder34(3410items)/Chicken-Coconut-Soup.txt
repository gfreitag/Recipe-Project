Title: Chicken Coconut Soup
Categories: Thai, Poultry, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
6    Black peppercorns
4    Kaffir lime leaves
1    Lemon grass stem
1/4 c  Fish sauce
1/4 c  Lime juice
1    Chicken breast
1 3/4 c  Thick coconut milk

2    Red chillies
Recipe Information:

Buying Guide:

Galangal is available dried in jars from Sainsbury's supermarkets in
the UK, or from Thai or Oriental food stores. Kaffir lime leaves are
also available from Thai or Oriental food stores. Fresh root ginger
can be used in place of galangal and strips of lime zest can be used
in place of kaffir lime leaves. I've occasionally used lime juice as
a replacement.

Cook's Tip:

Canned coconut milk separates into two layers: a thick top cream and
a thin milk underneath. If stirred together these form thick coconut
milk. Use whichever part the recipe requires; any excess can be
frozen.

Preparation Time: 10-15 minutes Cooking Time: 20 minutes

Preparation:

Skin and bone the chicken breast (cut when partially frozen; it makes
it easier to cut thin slices) Seed the chillies and cut into strips
Crush the black peppercorns Tear the kaffir lime leaves in half

1. Cut the chicken into thin strips across the grain 2. COmbine the
coconut milk and chicken stock in a large saucepan and bring to the
boil. 3. Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the sliced chicken,
galangal, chillies, peppercorns, lime leaves and lemon grass. 4.
Simmer gently for 15029 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked
through and tender. 5. Add the fish sauce and lime juice and serve.
