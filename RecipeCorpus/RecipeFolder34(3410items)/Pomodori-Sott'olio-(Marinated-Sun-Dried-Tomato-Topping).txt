1 c  Olive oil
4 oz Sun-dried tomatoes

Soak the tomatoes in 3/4 c warm water & 3/4 c warm vinegar for 2 to 3
hours.  Drain & set on a kitchen towel. Pat dry.

Stir together the basil, red pepper flakes, garlic & salt.

In a 12 ounce jar, alternate layers of the tomatoes with the basil

preserved in oil.
