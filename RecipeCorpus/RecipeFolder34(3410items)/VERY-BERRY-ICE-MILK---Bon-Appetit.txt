manufactur- er's instructions. (Or, to freeze without an ice cream
maker: Pour mixture into baking pan. Freeze uncovered until edges are
solid but center is still slushy, about 2 hours. Transfer to
processor and blend until smooth. Return to pan and freeze uncovered

processor and blend until smooth.) Transfer ice milk to plastic
container. Cover and freeze several hours or overnight to mellow
flavors. If frozen solid, let soften slightly at room temperature
before serving.
