Title: CHERRY HEARTS - Country Cooking
Categories: Country coo, Breads, Fruit
Yield: 8 scones
2/3 c  Butter
1 1/3 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Cherry preserves
Red sugar crystals (opt.)
4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1. Heat oven to 425F. Grease large baking sheet. In large bowl,
combine flour, 3 T granulated sugar, the baking powder, baking soda,
and salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter in until
mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

2. Add buttermilk to dry ingredients and mix lightly with fork until
mixture clings together and forms a soft dough.

3. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 5 or 6
times. With floured rolling pin, roll dough out to 1/4-inch
thickness. With 4-inch heart shaped cookie cutter, cut dough into
hearts. Lightly press trimmings together and reroll to cut out more
hearts. You should have 16.

4. Place 8 dough hearts (rerolled ones are best here) on greased
baking sheet. Spoon 2 t preserves into center of each heart. Lightly
moisten edges of dough around preserves with water and place a second
heart on top. Press along edges to seal. Sprinkle tops with reserved
granulated sugar and, if desired, red sugar crystals.

5. Bake 15 to 18 minutes or until the cherry-heart scones are golden
brown and baked through. Serve warm.
