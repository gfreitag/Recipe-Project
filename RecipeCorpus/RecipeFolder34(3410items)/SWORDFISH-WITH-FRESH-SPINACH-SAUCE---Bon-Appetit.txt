Yield: 8 servings
2 c  Canned chicken broth
2/3 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Whipping cream
8 c  Stemmed spinach
-(about 6 oz)
Salt and pepper
8    Lime wedges
8    Parsley sprigs
8    Small swordfish steaks
1/2 c  Vegetable oil

1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 tb Grated lemon peel
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Minced shallots

Pierce fish on both sides with fork. Place in single layer in
nonaluminum baking dish just large enough to accommodate. Blend oil
with next 4 ingredients. Pour over fish. Refrigerate 2 hours, turning
once.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and
stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Increase heat. Add mush rooms and
cook until juices evaporate, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.
Mix in broth and wine. Boil until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
Add cream and simmer until reduced to 1 1/3 cups, about 10 minutes.
Strain into blender. Add spinach and blend until smooth. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat) or preheat broiler. Drain fish,
reserving marinnade. Cook fish until just opaque, brushing with
marinade and turning once, about 9 minutes per inch of thickness.
Transfer fish to plates. Top each with sauce. Garnish with lime
wedges and parsley and serve.
