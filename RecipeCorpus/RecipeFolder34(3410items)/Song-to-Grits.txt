Song to Grits

When my mind's unsettled, When I don't feel spruce, When my nerves get
frazzled, When my flesh get loose,

What knits Me back together's grits.

Grits with gravy, Grits with cheese, Grits with bacon, Grits with
peas, Grits with minimun Of two over-medium eggs mixed in 'em: um!

Grits, grits, it's Grits, I sing-- Grits fits In with anything.

Rich and poor, black and white, Lutheran and Campbellite, Jews and
Southern Jesuits All acknowledge buttered grits.

Give me two hands, give me my wits, Give me forty pounds of grits.

Grits at taps, grits at reveille, I am into grits real heavily.

True grits, More grits, Fish, grits and collards. Life is good where
grits are swallered.

Grits Sits Right.

~Roy Blount, Jr. One Fell Soup.
