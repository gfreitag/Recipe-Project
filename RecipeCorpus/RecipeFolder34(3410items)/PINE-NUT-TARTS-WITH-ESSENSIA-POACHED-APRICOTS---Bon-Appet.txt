Essensia is a popular dessert wine made in California. These apricots
are also good on their own, served over vanilla ice cream or with
whipped cream.

For pastry: Combine flour, sugar and salt in bowl. Add butter and cut
in using pastry cutter, 2 knives or fingers until mixture resembles
coarse meal. Stir in yolk and vanilla; dough will be crumbly. Gather
dough into ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Divide dough among four 3 1/2 x 1 1/2-inch round tart pans with
removable bottoms. Using fingers, press dough into bottoms and up
sides of pan to thickness of 1/6 inch. Chill 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375'F. Line shells with foil or parchment and fill
with dried beans or pie weights. Bake 15 minutes. Remove beans and
foil and continue baking until crusts are golden brown, about 10
minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool completely. Store
airtight at room temperature.)

For filling: Preheat oven to 375'F. Using electric mixer, cream
butter and sugar until thick and pale. Stir in ground nuts, flour,
egg and yolk. Spoon filling into crusts, spreading evenly. Bake until
almost set, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle tarts with whole pine nuts.
Continue baking until golden and puffy around edges, about 10
minutes. Spread each with glaze. Cool tarts to room temperature.

For apricots: Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.
Add sugar and cook until light brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in
Essensia and bring to boil. Reduce heat to simmer. Add apricots and
cook just until skin loosens, about 10 minutes. Remove apricots from
syrup. Boil syrup until reduced to 2 cups. Peel, halve and pit
apricots. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Return apricots to syrup
and let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat.)

Spoon apricot syrup onto plates. Top with tarts. Garnish with poached
apricots and serve.
