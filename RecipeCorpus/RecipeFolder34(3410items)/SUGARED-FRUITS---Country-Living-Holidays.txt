Categories: Country liv, Holiday, Fruit
Yield: 10 servings
1/3 c  Meringue powder mixed with
-3 to 4 T water (or if not
-to be eaten, 3 large egg
-whites)
1 1/2 lb Assorted fresh fruit such as
-plums, lady apples, figs,
-limes, pears, apricots,
-peaches, grapes, & kumquats
3/4 c  Sugar
1. Several hours before use, prepare sugared fruit. If fruit is to be
eaten, use meringue powder; if not, egg white may be used. Rinse
fruit in cool water and gently pat dry on paper towels.

2. In separate small bowls, place sugar and meringue-powder mixture
(or egg whites if the decorations will not be eaten). Holding 1 piece
of fruit at a time, with a small pastry brush, paint all sides with
meringue-powder mixture.

3. Holding the fruit over the bowl of sugar, sprinkle all sides with
sugar until well coated. Place sugared fruit on wire rack over waxed
paper and let stand in warm place until sugar dries and hardens.
Repeat to coat all pieces. Rinse and dry fingers frequently to remove
stickiness.

4. Arrange fruit in a pyramid on a pedestal plate, in a basket, or on
a decorative platter.
