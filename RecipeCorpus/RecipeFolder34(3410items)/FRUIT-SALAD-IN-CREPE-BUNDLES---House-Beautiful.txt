Prepare crepes: In a large bowl sift flour, sugar and salt and make a
well in the center. Whisk the milk into the flour gradually, until it
is combined. Add eggs one at a time, whisking quickly until
incorporated. Whisk in butter and allow batter to sit at room
temperature for 30 minutes.

Heat a non-stick 10-inch crepe pan over medium-high heat until hot,
add 1/3 C batter and swirl the pan until the batter covers the
surface in an even layer. Cook until crepe bub- bles on top, turn and
cook for 30 seconds. Remove crepe from pan and keep warm in oven at
low temperature. Repeat process with the remaining batter. Makes 8
crepes. Extra crepes may be frozen.

Prepare filling: In a non-stick pan over medium heat, add apple, pear
and pineapple and saute until warm. Remove pan from heat and set
aside.

To serve: In the center of each crepe, evenly divide and mound fruit
mixture and top with a generous T of whipped cream. Gently gather the
crepe together and slightly twist. The cream will help it stay to-
gether. Wrap strips of orange zest around the narrow neck of the
crepe. Place crepes in the center of a dessert plate and drizzle or
dot the berry puree around it. Serve immediately. Serves 4.
