Categories: House beaut, Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 5 dozen
1/3 c  Clover honey or other mild
-honey
2 lg Eggs
Grated zest of 2 large
-lemons
1    Egg, for glaze
3 tb Poppy seeds, for decoration
4 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Baking powder
2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 3/4 ts Ground cloves
24 tb (3 sticks) unsalted butter,
-slightly softened
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
In a medium bowl sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder,
cinnamon and cloves; set aside.

In a large mixing bowl beat butter until fluffy. Beat in sugar and
honey. Add eggs and lemon zest and beat well. Stir in dry ingredients
in 2 batches.

Divide dough into thirds and place each portion between large sheets
of waxed paper. Using a rolling pin, roll each third out to 1/4-inch
thickness, smoothing any wrinkles in paper as you roll. Slide rolled
dough sheets onto a tray and chill 20 to 25 minutes, or until
slightly firm.

Working with 1 chilled dough sheet at a time, carefully peel away the
bottom layer of waxed paper and replace it loosely. Turn dough over
and discard top layer of waxed paper. Using assorted cookie cutters,
cut out cookies. Carefully lift cookies from waxed paper with a
spatula and space about 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets.

Reroll dough scraps between new waxed paper sheets. Chill and continue
cutting out cookies until all dough is used. Repeat with remaining
dough sheets.

In a small bowl beat egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush tops of
cookies with egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds.

Bake in center of a preheated 375'F oven 9 to 11 minutes, or until
cookies are a rich tan color all over, and just slightly darker
around edges. Remove from oven and let stand 2 minutes. Transfer to
wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 1
week or freeze up to 1 month. Makes about 5 dozen cookies.
