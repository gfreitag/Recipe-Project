Title: Pecan Bars
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 16 servings
MMMMM----------------------------BASE---------------------------------
10 tb Unsalted butter
1    Egg white -- for glazing
1 1/4 c  Flour
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
2 tb Powdered sugar
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
pn Salt
3 tb Unsalted butter -- melted
1 1/2 c  Pecans -- chopped
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Sugar
10 tb Dark corn syrup
2    Eggs -- at room temp.
Preheat the oven to 350.  Lightly grease a 9" square pan.  For the
base, process the flour and powdered sugar in a food processor for
several seconds.  Add the butter and process until the dough comes
together, 20 to 30 seconds.  Pat the dough gently over the bottom of
the prepared pan and push it 1/2" up the sides with your thumb.
Glaze it with the egg white. Pour off the excess.  Bake the base on
the center oven rack until lightly golden, about 30 minutes.  Place
the base in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to cool completely.  Keep
the oven on.  Meanwhile prepare the topping:  Gently whisk together
both sugars, the corn syrup, eggs, vanilla and salt in a medium size
bowl until blended.  Stir in the melted butter, then the nuts.  Pour
the topping evenly over the base.  Bake the bars until the topping is
set and forms a crust, about 50 minutes.  Allow the bars to cool for
15 minutes on a rack, then run a sharp knife around the sides of the
pan.  Cool the bars completely and cut into squares.
