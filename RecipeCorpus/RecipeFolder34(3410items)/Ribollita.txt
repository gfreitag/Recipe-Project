1. Rinse and cover the beans with cold water and soak overnight.

2. Drain the beans and place them in a saucepan with 8 cups cold
water. Cook, covered, for 1 hour. Add 1 tsp of the salt and continue
cooking for an additional 30 mins, or until the beans are tender. Set
the beans aside with their liquid.

3. Over a medium heat, heat the olive oil in a large soup pot. Over
medium heat, saute the zucchini, onions, celery, carrots, pancetta,
and garlic until softened, about 10 mins. Add the cabbage, tomatoes,
basil, and spinach. Season with the remaining 1 tsp salt and pepper.
Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for another 10 mins.

4. Strain the beans, reserving their cooking liquid. Puree half the
beans in a food processor. Add the pureed beans, the whole beans, and
their cooking liquid (8 cups) to the soup pot and simmer over low
heat for 20 mins. If you don't have enough cooking liquid, add water
to make up the difference.

5. Add the diced sourdough bread to the soup and cook for 10 more
mins. Adjust the seasoning. Serve with the Pecorino Romano and
drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
