1. Several hours or day before serving, prepare Apricot Mint Sauce: In
2-quart saucepan, melt butter. Add onion and cook until lightly
browned and tender. Add broth, apricots, vinegar, honey, and cumin;
heat mixture to boiling over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low,
and simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture is saucelike about
10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chopped mint; cover and
refrigerate.

2. One hour before serving, prepare Lamb: Place hay in roasting pan
and pour water over hay. Trim lamb racks so that 1 1/2 inches of each
rib bone is exposed. Trim excess fat, leaving 1/4-inch layer of fat
over racks. If desired, with knife, score fat layer in a diamond
pattern.

3. Heat oven to 375'F. Arrange racks on hay in roasting pan parallel
to each other with fat side out. Press together at top, alternating
bones. With string, tie racks together. Sprinkle with salt, pepper,
rosemary, oregano, and thyme.

4. Bake racks 40 to 50 minutes or until meat thermometer, inserted in
center of meat portion of widest rack, registers 140'F for rare.
Remove string from top of racks; place hay and racks on serving
platter. Garnish racks with parsley, rosemary, and thyme sprigs, if
desired. To serve, slice lamb between bones and pass Apricot Mint
Sauce, garnished with mint sprigs, if desired.
