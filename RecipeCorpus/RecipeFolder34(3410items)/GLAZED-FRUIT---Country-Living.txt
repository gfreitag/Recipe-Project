1 lb Seedless green grapes
1 lb Seedless red grapes
6    Fresh or dried figs
6    Fresh or candied kumquats
4 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Sugar

1. In 4-quart saucepan, heat water and sugar to boiling over high
heat, stirring occasionally until sugar dissolves. Cut lemon and
orange peels into strips and add to sugar mixture, or syrup, along
with cloves, peppercorns, vanilla bean, and nutmeg. Return syrup to
boiling; reduce heat to low.

2. Core pears and apples through bottom end, leaving stems intact.
With channel knife or sharp paring knife, remove 1/16 inch-wide
strips of skin from pears and apples to form stripe or spiral
patterns, if desired. Place pears in sugar syrup and poach 12 to 15
minutes, or until just tender. Time will vary depending upon ripeness
of fruit. With slotted spoon, transfer pears to platter. Poach apples
in sugar syrup 8 to 10 minutes; remove and set aside with pears.

3. Pour syrup into a 10-inch skillet and heat to boiling over high
heat. Boil syrup to reduce to 1 C-about 40 minutes.

4. Brush or spoon reduced syrup over pears, apples, clementines, blood
oranges, grapes, figs, and kumquats until coated. Place fruit on
platter around turkey.

5. Remove fruit to another platter before carving turkey. With sharp
knife, quarter pears, apples, clementines, and blood oranges; halve
figs and kumquats. With scissors, snip grapes into small bundles.
Serve with turkey.
