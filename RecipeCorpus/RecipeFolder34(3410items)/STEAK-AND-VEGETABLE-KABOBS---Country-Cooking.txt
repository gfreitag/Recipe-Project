1.  In medium-size bowl, combine beef, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar,

2. Meanwhile, heat coals or wood in a grill until hot, and soak wood
chips in water for 30 minutes. Lightly oil or coat grill rack with
nonstick vegetable cooking spray and set aside.

3. In heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat 2 inches water and onion to
boiling over high heat; cook onion 5 minutes or until softened.
Remove stem and seeds from pepper. Cut pepper into large pieces and
blanch a few seconds in the same boiling water with the onion. Drain
vegetables. Cut onion into 12 wedge-shaped slices, keeping the pieces
intact.

4. Drain wood chips and place on hot coals. Heat the grill rack. To
make kabobs, on each of 6 long metal skewers, alternately thread
vegetables with 3 chunks of beef, reserving the marinade. Brush
vegetables with olive oil.

5. Place kabobs on hot grill rack about 4 inches above medium-hot
coals. Grill 8 minutes or until beef is cooked to desired degree of
doneness, turning and basting occasionally with the reserved marinade.
