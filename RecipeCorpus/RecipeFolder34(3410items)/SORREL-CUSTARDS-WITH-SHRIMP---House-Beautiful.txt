Categories: House beaut, Main dish, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 lb Medium shrimp, shelled
Pinch of saffron
1 tb Minced shallots
1 1/2 tb Butter
1 c  Chopped sorrel leaves
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Milk
2    Eggs
In a skillet over low heat, melt 1/2 T butter and cook sorrel and 6 T
parsley until wilted, about 1 or 2 minutes.

In a bowl, beat 1/2 C cream, milk and eggs. Stir in sorrel mixture,
salt and pepper. Butter 4 1/2-cup ramekins or custard cups with
remaining butter and pour cream and sorrel mixture into them.

Place cups in a pan containing 1 inch water, cover pan with aluminum
foil and bake in a preheated 375'F oven until custards are set or
until a knife inserted midway between center and rim comes out clean.
Timing depends on oven. Test after 25 minutes.

In a saucepan bring wine to a simmer, poach shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes,
stirring constantly, remove from liquid and set aside. Add saffron and
shallots to the poaching liquid and reduce liquid to about 1 T. Add
remaining cream to the pan and simmer for 10 minutes or until sauce
thickens.

Run a knife around the sides of the custards to loosen them, and
invert each one onto the center of a plate, tapping the bottom. Pour
sauce around the custards and arrange shrimp in a circle. Garnish
with remaining parsley and serve immediately. Serves 4.
