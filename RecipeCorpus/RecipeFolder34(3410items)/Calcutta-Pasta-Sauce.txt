The editors wrote: "The Italians do not have a corner on tomato
sauce. We received recipes for ones of Indian, Mexican, Caribbean and
other ethnic persuasions - many quite complex and intriguing. Except
perhaps for the garam masala (for which you could substitute
commercial curry powder), this exotic dish could come right from your
local supermarket."
