In an 8-to 10-quart stockpot, add chicken, celery, onion, garlic,
salt, peppercorns and water. Bring mixture to the barest simmer and
continue to skim surface until it is clear of foam. Adjust heat and
partially cover so that liquid simmers steadily.

In a preheated broiler, broil tomatoes in an ungreased pan for 7
minutes on each side. Place 2 to 3 T soup broth in the pan to loosen
pan juices and add everything to the simmering soup.

Cook chicken for about 1 hour or until juices run clear when pierced.
Remove the chicken from pot and set aside covered.

Add chilies, squash, cabbage and potatoes to the pot and simmer,
uncovered, for 20 minutes.

Add the corn to pot for the last 5 minutes. Taste soup broth and
adjust seasoning. Cut chicken into serving pieces and return to the
pot.

Remove skewers from cabbage and ladle soup into very large bowls,
with some of every ingredient in each bowl. Serve with optional
garnishes. Serves 6.
