Recipe by: ids@virginia.edu (Ileen D. Snow)

Cut into bite size pieces any vegetables you like, mainly, pot.
carrots, onions, celery, etc. Purchase the least expensive piece of
beef or chicken if you prefer and cut it into bite size pieces,
removing most of the fat and marbling. Put it all mixed up into a
crock pot with 1 can of Golden Cream of Mushroom Soup and 1 can of
plain tomato soup, and about 1/2 to 1 can of cold water.  Cook 5-8
hurs.  on slow or med., and you may not want to use any seasonings
until after the first time.  Other than a little pepper, that is all
I have ever needed to add.
