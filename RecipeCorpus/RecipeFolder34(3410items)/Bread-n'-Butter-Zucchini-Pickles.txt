Categories: Pickles, Vegetables, Can/preserv
Yield: 12 cups
1 tb Salt
1 ts Tumeric
1/8 ts Powdered Alum
2 lg Onions, sliced
10 c  Thinly sliced zucchini
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Celery Seed
2 ts Dry Mustard
2 1/2 c  Cider Vineagr
Throughly scrub squash, don't peel. In large kettle, combine
vinegar, sugar, salt, mustard, tumeric, celery seed & Alum. Add
vegetables. Bring to a boil and simmer 7 to 15 minutes or until
squash is transparent. Pour mixture in sterilized jars. Seal and
water bath for 10 minutes. NOTE: This is a good bread and butter
pickle that can be used very successfully for older, larger squash
unsuitable for other uses. NOTE: The water batch is not really
necessary. I used it to make sure the jars sealed. The pickles really
didn't last very long in my house. Submitted By KATHRYN CONE   On
