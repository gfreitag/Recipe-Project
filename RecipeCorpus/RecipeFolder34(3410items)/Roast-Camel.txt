Title: Roast Camel
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 servings
1    Pair of tweezers and/or
Latex gloves
1    Toothpick (per camel)
Match or lighter
An umbrella
8 oz Glass lemonade, or favorite
Cool refreshment
Really long, boring book
1    Pair binoculars
First, pick a nice spot in the desert in which to sit and wait.  (It
should be noted that waiting is the most time-consuming element of
this dish.) Arrange yourself in the sand, with the umbrella placed so
that it blocks the harsh desert sun. Be sure to drink plenty of
fluids.

Before long, it is certain that a camel will wander into the picture.
Now, camels are not particularly social creatures, so it is very
important that you pique the beast's interest by engrossing yourself
in the long, boring book.  The camel, being a literate, if modest
being, will naturally be very curious.  If you make enough facial
expressions and 'hmm, interesting's, the camel's fascination will be
aroused to the point that it decides to read the book over your
shoulder. Now, the book being as boring as it is, and the sun beating
down so unrelentlessly, said camel will soon doze off.

At this point, you must move quickly and quietly.  Without disturbing
the snoozing dromedary or bactrian, gaze at it through the large end
of the binoculars.  The camel will, of course, be very small.  Pick
the camel up GENTLY with the tweezers (sterilized) or the gloves, so
as not to contaminate the food, and roast it over the match flame.
Place on toothpick (preferably the kind with that cute little frilly
thing on top) for presentation.

Note  This also works with alligators and things that would prefer to
eat you before you eat them.  It does not, repeat--NOT-- work with
iguanas.

*addendum* Further, when offerring the your guest the camel, it is
courtesy to ask, "One hump or two?"
