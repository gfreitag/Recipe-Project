1. Trim the leek, wash it well, and cut it into 1-inch pieces. (You
should have about 1 cup.) Peel and coarsely chop the onion.

2. Heat the peanut oil in a saucepan and when hot, add the leeks,
onions and garlic, and saute for 2 mins. Then add the stock, water,
potatoes, salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the
heat to low, and boil gently for 25 mins.

3. Meanwhile, remove the crusts from the bread and cut it into
1/2-inch croutons. (You should have 1 1/4 cups.) Moisten the croutons
with the vegetable oil and spread them on a cookie sheet. Place in a
preheated 400 F oven for 8 to 10 mins, until nicely browned.

4. When the soup is cooked, strain it through a sieve, retaining the
liquid. Place the solids in the bowl of a food processor and process
until smooth. Return to the saucepan with the reserved liquid and add
the milk. Bring to a boil and serve with the croutons. Makes 4
servings (6 cups).
