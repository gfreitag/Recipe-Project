1 ts Framboise or kirsch (opt.)
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Recipe Flaky Butter Pastry
Flour for rolling
1 pt Ripe blackberries, about 2 C    2 1/2 tb All-purpose flour

Roll the dough as directed for the desired tart size. Transfer the
dough to a baking sheet and refrigerate while you prepare the berries.

In a medium bowl, place the blackberries and toss with the lemon
juice and framboise if desired and all but 1 T of the sugar. Set
aside.

In a small bowl, combine the 2 1/2 tablespoons flour with the
remaining sugar. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and sprinkle
the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a border
uncovered as directed above. Arrange the fruit evenly over the
flour-sugar mixture. Fold the rim of dough over the fruit, crimping
the seams lightly with moistened fingers. Shave the butter on top of
the berries.

Bake the tart in a preheated 400'F oven as directed above.
