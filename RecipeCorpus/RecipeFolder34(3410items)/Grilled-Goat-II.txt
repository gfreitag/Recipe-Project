Title: Grilled Goat II
Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
A few annatto seeds
1    Or 2 dried ancho peppers
-- unseeded
4 lb Leg of goat
Meat tenderizer
2 c  Red wine (approx.)
1/2 c  Olive oil (approx.)
Cut goat leg at the knee-bone, pierce meat several times, rinse in
water and sprinkle on meat tenderizer. Place meat in a bowl, cover
loosely and refrigerate several hours.

About 2 hours before grilling, place meat in a large pot, add enough
water to cover; bring water to a boil and then lower heat and simmer
for about 10 minutes. Remove meat from water, place back in the bowl
and add about 2 cups red wine. Allow meat to soak in wine for 20-30
minutes. Discard water and wine.

While meat is in wine, place 1/2 cup or so of olive oil in a skillet
and add annatto seeds and an ancho pepper or two. Heat oil and stir
seeds until oil takes on the color of the annatto seeds (orange).
Keep heat low, allow oil to cool and brush over meat while grilling.

When grill is ready, cook meat about 10 minutes on one side, then 5
or so on the other, or until meat is done. Goat turns out fairly
tender.
