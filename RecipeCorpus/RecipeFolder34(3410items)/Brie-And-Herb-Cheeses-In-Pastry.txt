Title: Brie And Herb Cheeses In Pastry
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 10 servings
1    Egg -- beaten
1 tb Water
1    Frozen puff pastry
14 oz Wheel of brie
8 oz Garlic and herb soft cheese
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Lightly flour baking sheet.  Place puff pastry on prepared sheet and
roll out genly to remove fold lines.  Place brie in center of pastry.
Spread 4 ounces of the soft cheese over the top of the brie.  Turn
brie over and spread remaining soft cheese on other side of brie.
Bring pastry up around sides and over cheese, wrapping completely and
trimming excess pastry. Turn over on baking sheet seam side down.

Gather pastry scraps, reroll, and cut out decorations for top of
pastry (ex: grapes and grape leaves) Combine egg and water and brush
all over top and sides of pastry.

Bake 30-35 minutes, until golden brown.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Serve
warm.

NOTES : Other ideas - use baked garlic puree and cream cheese instead
of prepared soft cheese.  Peel and thinly slice pears and arrange on
pastry, mix together cinnamon, walnuts, and brown sugar and place on
pears, dot with butter, then lay brie on top and seal pastry, turn
over and bake.
