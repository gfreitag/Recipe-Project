The juice from fresh pomegranates imparts a reddish hue to this lemon
syrup. Diluted with sparkling water, the syrup makes a refreshing
naturally pink lemonade.

1. In 2-quart saucepan, heat sugar and water to boiling over
medium-high beat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. When
mixture boils, lower heat and simmer 2 minutes longer. Remove syrup
from heat; cool to room temperature.

2. Stir lemon juice and pomegranate juice into sugar syrup until well
mixed. Pour through funnel into bottles. Cover, label, and store
syrup in the refrigerator. (If desired, attach a card that reads: To
make one serving of lemonade, pour 1/2 C syrup over ice cubes in a
tall glass; add sparkling water, seltzer, club soda, or water to
taste. Stir and serve immediately.)

Note: To extract juice from the pomegranates, with tip of knife,
score a fruit's leathery skin into 6 or 8 wedges. Gently pull the
wedge-shaped sections apart. With fingers, gently remove seeds and
place them in a blender or a food proces- sor. Using on and off
pulses, crush the seeds. Do not overblend or you will grind the
seeds, which are bitter. Strain juice through a sieve into a C;
discard see&.
