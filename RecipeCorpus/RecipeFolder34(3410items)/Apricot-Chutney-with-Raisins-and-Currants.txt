Title: Apricot Chutney with Raisins and Currants
Categories: Indian, Condiments, Companion
Yield: 4 cups
2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
-- (or MORE if desired)
3/4 c  Golden raisins
1/2 c  Currants
1 lb Dried apricots
10 lg Garlic cloves
-- peeled & coarsely chopped
1    1x3" piece of fresh ginger
-- peeled & coarsely chopped
1 1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
Put the apricots in a bowl.  Pour 4 cups of hot water over them and
let them soak for an hour.

Put the garlic, and ginger into the container of an electric blender
or a food processor along with 1/4 cup of the vinegar.  Blend until
smooth.

Empty the apricots and their soaking liquid into a heavy
stainless-steel or porcelain-lined pot.  Add the garlic-ginger
mixture, the remaining vinegar, sugar, salt, and cayenne.  Bring to a
boil.  Simmer on a medium flame, stirring frequently, for 45 minutes.
Do not let the chutney catch at the bottom of the pot.  Lower heat if
necessary.  Add the raisins and currants and cook, stirring, another
half hour or until chutney takes on a thick, glazed look.  (It will
thicken slightly as it cools.)  Let the chutney cool and store,
refrigerated, in lidded glass or ceramic jars.
