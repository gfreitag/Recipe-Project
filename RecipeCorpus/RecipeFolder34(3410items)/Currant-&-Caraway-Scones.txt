Yield: 12 scones
1 tb Caraway seeds
1 tb Orange zest; grated
1 c  Buttermilk
1 tb Canola oil
1 lg Egg; lightly beaten with
. 1 tbsp water
1 c  Currants
1 c  Sweet marsala wine
2 c  Flour; all-purpose
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Salt
Preheat the oven to 350Ã¸F.  Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with
vegetable oil cooking spray.

Combine the currants and marsala wine in a small saucepan.  Bring to a
simmer over low heat and stir until the liquid is absorbed, about 3
minutes, set aside to cool.

Sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt
into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the caraway seeds and orange zest.  In a
small bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil and reserved currant mixture.
Add to the dry ingredients and stir just until blended.  (The dough
will be slightly sticky.)

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat into a
circle that is about 1/2-inch thick.  Cut the dough into 12 wedges and
transfer to the prepared baking sheet.

Brush the tops with the egg glaze.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or
until the tops are golden and firm to the touch.  Serve warm.
