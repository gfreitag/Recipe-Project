1/2 ga Lemon or vanilla frozen

Fresh blueberry leaves or

1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
1. For the crust, combine crushed cookies and butter; press into
bottom of 8-inch springform pan with removable bottom. Freeze until
ready to fill.

2. For the blueberry filling, in 2-quart saucepan, combine sugar,
cornstarch, water, lemon rind, and lemon juice until well mixed. Stir
in blueberries. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly to crush some of
the berries. Cool to room temperature then refrigerate until ready to
serve.

3. Let frozen yogurt stand at room temperature until it is easy to
scoop. Spoon two-thirds of frozen yogurt into crust, spreading to an
even layer. Hollow out the center to make a 1-inch-high rim, about
1/2 inch thick, around side of pan. Freeze pan and remaining yogurt
until firm.

4. Just before serving, let remaining yogurt stand until soft enough
to spoon. Pour half of the blueberry filling into hollowed center of
the yogurt in the pan. Spoon dollops of the remaining yogurt on
blueberry filling to cover and spread to an even layer; top with
remaining blueberry mixture. Remove side of pan. Place cake on
serving plate; surround with fresh blueberry leaves, if desired.
Serve immediately. Freeze any leftovers. (Let frozen cake stand 15
minutes at room tempera- ture to soften. Blueberry filling will be
very solid.)
