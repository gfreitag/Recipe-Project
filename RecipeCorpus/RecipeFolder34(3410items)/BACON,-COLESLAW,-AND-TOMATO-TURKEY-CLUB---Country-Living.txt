1. In large bowl, combine cabbage, mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, salt,
and pepper until well mixed. Let cabbage mixture, or coleslaw, stand
30 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, coat large skillet with nonstick vegetable cooking
spray. Heat over medium-low heat. Add half of tur- key bacon and cook
until crisp, turning frequently. Drain turkey bacon on paper towels.
Repeat to cook remaining slices.

3. With serrated knife, cut bread horizontally in half. With fingers,
remove soft bread from the center of each half, leaving 1/2-inch-thick
crust. (Freeze left-over soft bread for stuffing or bread crumbs.)

4. Place bottom bread half on serving plate. Spoon half of coleslaw
into bread. Top with bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, turkey, and remaining
coleslaw. Cover with top half of bread and press to compact slightly.

5. Just before serving, using serrated knife, cut sandwich into 6
wedges. Serve with pickled baby corn, if desired.

Note: Because the ingredients in commercially made mayonnaise are
specified by the FDA, any changes in the product, such as reducing
fat by one-third or using cholesterol-free ingredients, disqualifies
it from being labeled as mayonnaise.
