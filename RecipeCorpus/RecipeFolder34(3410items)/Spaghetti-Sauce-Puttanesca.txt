all. Break up the tomatoes and cook for 2 hours, then add the basil,
oregano and half the garlic.  Cook for 6 to 8 hours, adding a little
water as needed. The sauce will become a dark, rich red.  In the last
half hour, add the remaining garlic, olives and capers.  Cook for a
few minutes to blend the flavors. Serve over pasta and pass grated
Parmesan.

The editors wrote: "Anchovies, capers, olives and garlic result in a
mysterious and wholly Italian taste experience that even anchovy
haters tend to like.  This recipe was...the best of several on this
theme. We would only suggest the possibility of adding the fresh
herbs later in the cooking process."
