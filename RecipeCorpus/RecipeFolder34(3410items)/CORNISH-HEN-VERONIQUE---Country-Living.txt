2. In 1-quart saucepan, melt butter and set aside. Insert thyme
sprigs or sprinkle dried thyme into cavity of each of the hens; add
salt and pepper; truss and set hens on rack in a shallow baking pan.
Brush with melted butter; set saucepan aside.

3. Roast hens 55 to 60 minutes or until golden brown and the juices
run clear out of the cavities, brushing hens occasionally with
drippings in pan.

4. Meanwhile, cut off 2 small clusters of grapes and set aside for
garnish, if desired. Remove stems from remaining grapes; cut grapes
in half. In saucepan, combine undiluted grape-juice concentrate and
cornstarch until smooth.

5. When hens are done, transfer to serving plate; keep warm. Remove
rack and discard fat from drippings in baking pan. Stir wine into
drippings in baking pan; heat to boiling, stirring to loosen
browned-on bits.

6. Strain wine mixture into cornstarch mixture. Cook until thickened
and bubbly, stirring constantly. Stir in grape halves. Spoon some
grape sauce over hens; garnish with reserved grape clusters. Serve
the remaining grape sauce in a warmed pitcher or sauceboat.
