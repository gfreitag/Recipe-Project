Title: Tuna and Noodles
Categories: Main dish, Fish/seafoo, Pasta/rice
Yield: 3 servings
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
2 cn Tuna, drained
1 lg Package wide egg noodles
8 sl American cheese
1/2 c  Milk
Cook noodles in a large pan until tender.  While noodles are cooking,
melt cheese and milk together in a medium size saucepan.  Then add
mushroom soup.  Drain noodles and put them back in the pan.  Add tuna
to the cheese and soup mixture slowly, to leave the tuna in larger
pieces. Pour this over the noodles.  Stir carefully and simmer over a
very low heat until heated through.  I usually add a 4 ounce can of
sliced mushrooms as well, be sure to drain them. Randy Rigg
