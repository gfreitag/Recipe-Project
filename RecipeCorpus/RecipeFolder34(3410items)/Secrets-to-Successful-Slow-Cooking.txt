Always cook with the lid on.  You can hardly overcook; these
appliances are made for cooks who don't have time to pay attention.

For food safety, defrost frozen meats before placing them in the slow
cooker.

Don't use the slow cooker to reheat leftovers.  The microwave's the
ticket for that task.

Transfer foods to other containers for storage in the refrigerator
after cooking.

Never immerse heating elements in water.

Always unplug these appliances after use.  Some models have no "Off"
setting.

Avoid sudden temperature changes.  Thermal shock can crack a
Crock-Pot if you add frozen or really cold food to a preheated
ceramic pot.
