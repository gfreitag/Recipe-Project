Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Slab of salmon gravlax
1 tb Vegetable oil
In a large non-stick skillet over medium heat, heat oil for 1/2
minute. Add gravlax, skin-side down, raise heat to medium-high and
cook 2 to 3 minutes, shaking pan and lifting salmon a bit with a
spatula to loosen it from the pan during cooking, until the skin is
brown.

Reduce heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4 minutes, shaking pan
occasionally, until just cooked through. The bottom of the salmon
should be crisp. Cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces. Serves about 4.
