Title: Tarragon Mustard
Categories: Condiments, Salsa/sauce, Herbs/spice, Companion
Yield: 1 recipe
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1/4 c  White wine vinegar
1 ts Dried tarragon
1/8 ts Ground allspice
1/4 c  Black mustard seeds
1/4 c  Yellow mustard seeds
1/4 c  Dry mustard powder
3/4 c  Cold water
Mix mustard seeds, powdered mustard, and water in the upper pan of a
noncorrodible double boiler.  Let stand at least three hours.

In another noncorrodible saucepan, mix the wine, vinegar, tarragon,
and allspice and bring to a boil.  Strain the liquid into the mustard
mixture and blend well.

In the lower pan of the double boiler, heat water to boiling, then
reduce heat to a simmer.  Place the upper pan, containing the mustard
mixture, on top.  Cook, stirring, until the mustard is as thick as
you like.  It will thicken a bit more as it cools.  Cover and
refrigerate.
