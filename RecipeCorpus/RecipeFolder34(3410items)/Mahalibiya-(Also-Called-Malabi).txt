Title: Mahalibiya (Also Called Malabi)
Categories: Israeli, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
4 oz Coarsely chopped nuts

- and pinenuts
4 tb Date honey
4 c  Milk
1 c  Sugar
5 tb Cornstarch
- diluted in 1/4 cup water
2 ts Rose water
The origin of this dessert is Turkish, but it's much more popular in
Israel than in its homeland. On the streets one can find inferior
versions of Mahalibiya, but this version was the one served at the
Mossad restaurant in Tel-Aviv (no longer exists), and is considered
the best and most authentic one.

Bring the milk and the sugar to boil in a pan. Gradually add the
diluted cornflour, mix until smooth. Add the rose water and cook
another two minutes.

Divide among 8 dessert glasses, cool and refrigerate several hours.

Before serving, spoon the nut mixture evenly among glasses, and add a
little date honey. Makes 8 servings.
