1/2 c  Pickling or canning salt

1. Cut each cucumber either lengthwise into 4 spears or crosswise into
1/4-inch slices. In 8-quart stainless-steel or enamel saucepot,
combine salt and 2 quarts cold water; stir until most of salt dis-
solves. Add cucumbers and more cold water just to cover them. Top

and set aside.

turmeric, celery seeds, and mustard seeds; heat to boiling over high
heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer mixture or pickling solution 15
minutes.

4. Meanwhile, prepare six 1-pint jars, lids, and bands for processing
following manufacturer's directions.

5. Remove spice bag from pickling so- lution. Add half of cucumbers to
solution and heat to boiling. Using tongs, pack cucumber spears
upright into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/2-inch space at top of
jars. With slices, use spoon to pack them into jars. Ladle hot
pickling solution into jars to cover pickles; wipe jar rims clean.
Seal with lids and bands. Place in boiling-water canner. Repeat with
remaining cucumbers. Process jars in boiling-water bath for 10
