Combine water, oil, honey, raisins, and 4 Tbsp. brown sugar in blender
container.  Blend to liquefy.  Soften yeast in warm water with
remaining 1 Tbsp. brown sugar.  Sift together 1 cup unbleached flour,
2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup rye flour, nonfat milk powder and
salt in a large bowl. Add honey mixture and yeast.  Beat with mixer
at medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Gradually stir in
enough of remaining flours to make soft dough that leaves sides of
bowl.  Turn out onto floured surface and knead until smooth and
satiny, 10 to 12 minutes. Place dough in lightly greased bowl and
turn to grease other side. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
1/2 hours.  Punch down and let rest 10 minutes.  Shape into 4 round
loaves.  Place 2 loaves on each of 2 lightly greased baking sheets
sprinkled with cornmeal.  Cover and let rise in warm place until
light and doubled in size, about 1 hour.  Bake at 375 degrees for 30
to 35 minutes. Cool on racks.  While still hot, brush with melted
butter. Makes: 4 loaves
