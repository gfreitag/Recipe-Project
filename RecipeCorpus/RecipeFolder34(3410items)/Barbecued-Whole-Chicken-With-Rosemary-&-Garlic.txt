Title: Barbecued Whole Chicken With Rosemary & Garlic
Categories: Bbq/grill, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Garlic -- minced
Salt and pepper
3 1/2 lb Whole chicken
1/4 c  Rosemary needles
Starting at tip of the breastbone, loosen the skin from the breasts
of the chicken, being careful not to tear the skin.  Gently rub the
rosemary and garlic under the skin.  Sprinkle the outside of the
chickens with salt and pepper.  In a covered grill, build a small
fire off to one side, making sure that all of the fuel becomes
completely engulfed in flames.  When the flames have died down and
you are left with flickering coals, place the chickens on the grill
surface over the side with no fire.  It is important that the
chickens not come into contact with the flames at any time during
cooking.  Cover the grill and vent slightly.  You will need to check
the fire every 20 minutes or so as the chickens cook, adding a bit
more fuel as needed to keep the fire going.  After 2 hours check the
chickens for doneness.
