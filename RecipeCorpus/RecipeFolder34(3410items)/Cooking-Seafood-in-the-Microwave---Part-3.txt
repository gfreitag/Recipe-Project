How to Microwave Breaded Seafood

You CAN microwave breaded seafood. While you won't get the crisp
browning that contact with hot oil provides, a microwave can yield
light, flavorful and low-fat breaded fish.

The problem with cooking breaded food in the microwave is steam. Water
released from the hot food during cooking is trapped in the microwave
and can make the breading soggy. Also, little pockets of water
trapped near the surface of the seafood can burst during cooking.
This bursting of steam won't damage the fish, but it can ruin the
smooth appearance of the coating.

To cook breaded fish that looks good and tastes great, follow these
simple rules:

1. Cook fish in batches of one pound or less. The fish will cook
quickly and release less steam.

2. Position the fish so that the individual pieces do not touch each
other or the sides of the dish.

3. Use a dry coating. Cornmeal, crisp bread crumbs and crushed
crackers all work well. Packaged breading mixes, especially those
specifically intended for microwave use, also work well.

4. Microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) to reduce bursting. Fish that has
never been frozen bursts the most, while thawed frozen fish bursts
very little.

5. Loosely cover the baking dish with a paper towel. This will absorb
some of the released moisture and protect the inside of your oven from
splatters.
