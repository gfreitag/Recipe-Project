-pepper to taste
3/4 lb Veal loin, cut into
-8 equal portions
4 md Celery roots, trimmed
-and peeled
3 1/2 c  Vegetable stock (see
-separate recipe)
1 lg Leek, trimmed and washed
Cut 1 celery root into 2-by-1/4-by-1/4-inch sticks.

In a large stockpot, bring vegetable stock to a boil and add the
celery root sticks. Reduce heat to a gentle boil and cook until
celery root sticks are tender, about 5 minutes. Remove celery root
sticks from stock and reserve both.

Cut leek on the diagonal into 1/2-inch slices.

Over high heat, return vegetable stock to a boil, add leeks and cook
until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove leeks from stock and reserve
both.

Coarsely chop remaining celery roots and process through a vegetable
juicer, or grate in a food processor on the finest blade. Place
processed celery root in a linen tea towel and over a bowl, squeeze
out the juice. Discard the pulp.

Over high heat return vegetable stock to a boil and reduce stock to
one-third. Whisk in celery root juice and reduce by half. Add cream
and continue reducing sauce until it is the consistency of light
cream. Season to taste. Keep sauce warm over low heat.

In a non-stick pan over medium-high heat, saute leeks until pale gold
on each side, about 1 minute per side. Set aside.

Season veal lightly with salt and pepper. In a non-stick skillet over
medium heat, saute veal until golden on each side, at least 4 minutes
per side.

Evenly divide the sauce among 4 warmed dinner plates, place 2 pieces
of veal on top of sauce and surround with slices of leek and celery
root sticks. Serve immediately. Serves 4.
