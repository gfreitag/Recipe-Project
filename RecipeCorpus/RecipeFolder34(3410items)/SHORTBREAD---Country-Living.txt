Yield: 1 shortbread
1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Granulated sugar
3/4 c  (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted
-butter, softened
1 1/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1. Heat oven to 325'F. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat butter
until fluffy. Add flour, cornstarch, confectioners' sugar, and salt.
Beat at low speed, scraping side of bowl occasionally, until well
combined.

2. Form dough into a ball. Pat dough into a lightly oiled 7-inch
shortbread mold and unmold onto an ungreased baking sheet. (To make
petticoat tails, roll dough out on ungreased baking sheet to make a
10-inch round. Using a 4-inch dessert dish or saucer as a pattem,
with the point of a knife, score a 4 inch round in the center of the
dough. Remove dessert dish. Score center into 4 wedges and the outer
circle into 12 pieces. Press tines of fork into edge of round to
crimp edge.) Sprinkle granulated sugar over shortbread dough.

3. Bake shortbread mold 35 to 40 minutes (petticoat tails 18 to 20
minutes) or until center is firm to the touch and edges are beginning
to brown. Cool shortbread on baking sheet on wire rack. Serve whole
or break into pieces.
