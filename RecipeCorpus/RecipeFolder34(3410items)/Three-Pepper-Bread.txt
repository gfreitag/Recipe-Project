Title: Three-Pepper Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 servings
Dried -- crushed
1/4 c  Egg Substitute, Liquid
3 tb Margarine, Reduced-Calorie
1 ts White Pepper -- ground
1 ts Black Pepper -- ground
3 1/2 c  Bread Flour
1 1/2 c  Hot Water
1/4 c  Nonfat Dry Milk
1    1/4 Oz Pack Dry Yeast
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
3    Mild Chili Peppers,
In a medium bowl, combine the water, milk, yeast, sugar and salt and
stir well. Add the chili peppers, egg substitute, margarine, white
pepper and black pepper, stirring well. Stir in the flour, 1 cup at a
time, mixing well. With floured hands, place the dough on a lightly
floured surface and knead until it is smooth and slightly sticky to
the touch. Place the dough in a large bowl that has been sprayed with
nonstick vegetable cooking spray. Spray the top of the dough with the
cooking spray and cover with a clean, dry towel; let stand in a warm
place until doubled in size. Remove the towel and, with your fist,
punch the dough down, then place it on alightly floured surface.
Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a loaf by
pressing down and rolling with the palm of your hand and your
fingertips, tucking in the sides while rolling. Spray four 2 x 6 x
3-inch loaf pans with nonstick vegetable cooking spray. Put the dough
in the pans and cover with a dry towel; allow the dough to rise until
it doubles in size again. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 F.
Remove the towel and bake the bread for 30 mins, or until golden
brown on top. Let the bread cool for 10 mins before serving. Makes
four 1/2 lb. loaves. Note: Don't let the name and the pepper
combination fool you into thinking this is a hot, spicy bread. It is
just plain good with just a hint of zip to it.
