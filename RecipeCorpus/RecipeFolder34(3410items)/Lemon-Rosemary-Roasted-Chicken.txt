black pepper

Wash and dry the chicken. Chop one sprig of rosemary as fine as you
can chop it. Cut the lemons in half. Squeeze all the juice out of the
lemons. Smash the cloves of garlic with the flat side of a knife
blade (don't peel

them). Heat the oven to 375F. Place the garlic on the bottom of a
roasting

pan, along with one sprig of rosemary. Place the chicken in the pan,
breast up. Tuck half a lemon under each wing. Wrap one sprig of
rosemary around each leg. Put the last sprig plus the other two lemon
halves inside

the chicken. Pour the lemon juice over the chicken. Sprinkle pepper
and chopped rosemary over the chicken. Roast it 20 minutes, then
baste with pan juices. Roast it another 20 minutes, then baste again.
It's done when the juice runs clear.
