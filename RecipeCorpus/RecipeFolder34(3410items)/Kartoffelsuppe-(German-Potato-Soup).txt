Yield: 4 servings
1    Bay Leaf
10    Black Peppercorns
3    Juniper Berries -- optional
1 ts Caraway Seeds
1/2 ts Ground Nutmeg
1/2 ts Dried Marjoram -- optional
Salt And Pepper -- to taste
1/2 c  Sour Cream -- optional

-optional
1/2 lb Lean Bacon
1 md Onion -- diced
2 md Leeks, Trimmed Of Roots And
-Dark Tops -- diced
2    Celery Stalks -- julienned
3 md Carrots -- julienned
1/4 c  Fresh Parsley -- finely
-chopped
6 c  Beef Stock
2 lb Potatoes -- diced
1. Cut the bacon into 1-inch squares and place in a large saucepan or
Dutch oven. Slowly fry it over medium heat. When it is just short of
being crisp, remove the bacon, draining and reserving it.

2. Add the onion, leeks, celery, carrots, and parsley and cook until
the onion wilts. Add the beef stock and potatoes; raise the heat to
high and bring to a boil. Add the bay leaf, peppercorns, juniper
berries, caraway seeds, and nutmeg. Boil for 20 to 25 mins or until
the potatoes are soft when pierced with a fork. Add the reserved
bacon pieces.

3. At this point, you can go one of two ways: You can serve the soup
as a clear soup, sprinkling it with a little marjoram, salt, and
pepper; or remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon, placing them in
a large bowl. Mash them, and add 1/2 cup of sour cream and blend
thoroughly. Then stir potatoes back into the soup. This makes a
creamier style Kartoffelsuppe.

4. In both cases, remove bay leaf and add a sprig or two of parsley
on top of the soup before serving. Makes 4 servings.
