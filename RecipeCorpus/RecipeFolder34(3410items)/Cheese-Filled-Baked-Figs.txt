Title: Cheese Filled Baked Figs
Categories: Appetizers, Israeli, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
Salt and black pepper
1    Egg yolk
1 ts Pastis
18    Fresh figs
8 oz Cream cheese
2 oz Sliced almonds
Cut the top of each fig, creating a "lid", but let it remain
connected to the fig "body".

Using a small teaspoon, empty the fig contents to a bowl. Add the
remaining ingredients to the bowl, mix well with a fork. Fill each
fig plentifully, so that the "lid" doesn't close. Arrange the filled
figs on an oven tray, cover and refrigerate.

Transfer to a very hot oven 15 minutes before serving. Remove from
oven after 10 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, and serve. Makes 6
servings of 3 figs per person each.
