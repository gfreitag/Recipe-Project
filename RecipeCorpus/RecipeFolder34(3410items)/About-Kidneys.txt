Title: About Kidneys
Categories: Information, Meats
Yield: 1 text file  Veal is the most delicious, lamb soft and lacking in flavor but
excellent for grilling, beef the strongest flavored [needs lots of
soaking in salt water before cooking] and pork the cheapest.

Any white membrane should be removed with scissors before washing and
soaking. Soak kidneys in cold salted water for two hours to remove off
flavors. Then they can be blanched briefly in boiling water before
further cooking.

Veal and lamb should not be overcooked; they may be pink in their
centres. Beef can be tough and responds well to moist methods such as
stewing and casseroling.

If kidneys are of the best quality the pan juices may be used in
sauces; otherwise discard the juices if they have any off smell.
Avoid boiling kidneys in the sauce or prolonged high heat as this
toughens them.

They can be sauteed in butter, baked, stuffed with dressing and baked/
roasted, broiled, skewered and broiled/grilled [En Brochette],
casseroled with mushrooms or stewed and served on noodles or toast.
They have a great affinity for mushrooms, wine sauces and mustard and
are great in a mixed grill or an Irish breakfast.
