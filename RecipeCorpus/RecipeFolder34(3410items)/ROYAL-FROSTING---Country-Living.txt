Title: ROYAL FROSTING - Country Living
Categories: Cake/cookie, Country liv
Yield: 2 cups
Paste or powdered food
-coloring (opt.)
1 lb Confectioners' sugar
3    Large egg whites
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
This frosting is used not only to decorate or spread onto cookies but
also as an adhesive. Because of current health concerns about
salmonella in raw eggs, frosting on cookies that will be eaten should
be made from meringue powder (see Note) instead of egg whites
following package instructions. For purely decorative cookies, we
prefer this egg-white frosting over the meringue- powder version
beause of its stronger gluing property.

1. In medium-size bowl, with electric mixer, combine sugar, egg
whites, and cream of tartar just until well mixed. At high speed,
beat mixture until thick and fluffy.

2. Cover frosting tightly with a damp towel or plastic wrap while
using. If desired, to color frosting, divide into small bowls and mix
in food coloring.

Note: Meringue powder can be purchased wherever candy- making and
cake-decorating supplies are sold, or by mail from Wilton Industries,
Inc., 2240 75th St., Woodridge, 111. 60517; (800) 772-711 1. lih
