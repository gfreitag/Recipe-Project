Title: Frizzled Leeks
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Vegetable Oil
Salt
3 c  Leeks, White Part Only --
-julienned *
2 tb Flour
* Julienne about 1/16" thick and 2 inches long. Wash and dry
thoroughly.

1. In a 2-qt heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat hte oil to 320 F on a
deep-fat thermometer. (To check the temperature with a thermometer,
drop a small piece of bread the size of a crouton into the oil. It
should float to the top and lightly brown in about 2 mins.) Toss the
cut leeks in the flour and place them in a strainer to shake off the
excess.

2. Cook the leeks in 3 separate batches. Place each batch of leeks in
the oil and cook for 3 to 4 mins, until light blond. Remove with a
skimmer or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the
remaining leeks. Sprinkle the cooked leeks lightly with salt and
serve hot. Serves 4 to 6 as a garnish.

Note: Goes wonderfully with carrot soup, corn pudding, seared fish,
or any mashed potato recipe.
