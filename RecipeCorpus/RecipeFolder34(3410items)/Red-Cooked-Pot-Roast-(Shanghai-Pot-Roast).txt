Title: Red-Cooked Pot Roast (Shanghai Pot Roast)
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 12 servings
2 sl Ginger
2 cl Garlic, optional
1 oz Sugar
2    Star anise stars
-(optional for pork)
4 lb Chuck roast, boneless,
-not too lean
1 tb Sherry
1/2 c  Regular soy sauce
1 c  Water
Either brown the roast in a little fat or dunk it in boiling water
for a minute or so [this step is optional]. Put it into a heavy
kettle into which it fits fairly snugly. Add all the rest of the
ingredients (ginger slices, star anise, and garlic should be at the
bottom of the pot). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer
covered, turning and basting occasionally, for 3 hours or until
tender. Serve sliced, hot or cold. If cold, you may want to weight it
down with a brick covered in foil or some similarly heavy item while
chilling it in the fridge.

You may cook lamb or pork this way, but cut the cooking time to 2 - 2
1/2 hr. For lamb add a cinnamon stick instead of the star anise; for
pork double the soy sauce and sherry, either halve or omit the star
anise, and use up to 4 oz of sugar to taste.
