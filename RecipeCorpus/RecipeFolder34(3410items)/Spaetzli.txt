Title: Spaetzli
Categories: Side dish, French
Yield: 6 servings
Salt
125 g  Butter; melted
420 g  Flour
2    Eggs; beaten to mix
250 ml Water
Mix flour with eggs and water and a pinch of salt in the usual way,
either in a blender or by hand, making a well. Aim for a soft dough,
adding extra flour or water as needed. The softer the dough the
lighter the spaetzli will be, but if it's too soft, the noodles will
disintegrate when boiled. Put in a bowl, cover and leave aside for 30
mins to an hour. In a large saucepan, bring plenty of salted water
almost to the boil. Put the dough into a colander with very large
holes and push the dough through the holes into the hot water as
spirals. Cook the noodles in 2 or 3 batches, if necessary, they
shouldn't be crowded. When the noodles are done ( 4-6 mins) they will
float to the surface. Remove them to the pan of melted butter with a
slotted spoon and keep warm. Make sure that they are ALL removed as
soon as done, or they become soft and watery.

Season the spaetzli with pepper and a little salt, if needed. They
may be served as they are, or fried in the butter until golden brown.
You may also cook them in advance and reheat them in a Microwave oven
~ they reheat perfectly in it.
