amount of moisture created by the squash and tomatoes as they cook.
Do not add extra moisture as with prepared sauce, and make sure you
bake it without covering the baking pan in order for excess moisture
to evaporate during baking.

Bake, uncovered at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours, or until squash is
as tender as you prefer.

through with it!)
