Categories: Newspaper, Cheese/eggs, Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Blueberries
1 c  White chocolate baking chips
1/2 lb Light cream cheese
1/4 c  Sour cream; nonfat
Fresh mint for garnish
1 1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1/4 c  Butter; melted
1/2 c  + 2 Tbsp, sugar; divided
3 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Peaches; peeled & sliced
Combine the graham crumbs, butter and 2 Tbsp sugar in a small bowl;
blend until crumbly.  Pat the crumb mixture in the bottom and up to
the rim of a 9-inch round pie pan.  Bake in a 350Ã¸F oven 15 minutes,
or until brown; let cool.

In a saucepan over low heat, mix the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the
cornstarch; stir in the water, peaches and blueberries.  Stir over
high heat until the mixture boils and thickens, about 2 minutes; let
cool.

In the top of a double boiler over simmering water or in the
microwave at 50% power, melt the white chocolate chips; stir until
smooth. Remove from the heat and add the cream cheese and sour cream;
mix until smooth. Spread evenly over the crust.

Spoon the peach-blueberry mixture over the torte.  Cover, and chill at
least 12 hours.  When ready to serve, garnish with mint sprigs.
