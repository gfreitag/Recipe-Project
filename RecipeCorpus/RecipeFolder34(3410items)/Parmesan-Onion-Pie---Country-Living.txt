Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
1    Unbaked 9-inch piecrust
2 tb All purpose flour
1/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
3 tb Olive oil
1 lb Medium-size white onions,
-cut into wedges
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 lb Yellow onions, sliced
2 ts Dried thyme leaves
In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion wedges and
cook, stirring gently to keep wedges intact, until lightly
browned-about 5 minutes.  Transfer onion wedges to bowl.  Add butter
and onion slices to skillet.  Saute 5 minutes or just until wilted.
Stir in thyme, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook
onions 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, heat oven to 400F. Line piecrust with sheet of aluminum
foil and fill with uncooked fried beans or pie weights. Bake crust 5
minutes longer.

While crust is baking, stir flour into cooked onion slices until well
mixed.  Stir in water and cook onion mixture until thickened.  Remove
from heat.  Spoon onion mixture into partially baked piecrust.
Sprinkle with half of the Parmesan.  Top with onion wedges and
remaing Parmesan cheese.

Bake onion pie 35 minutes or until crust is golden brown and onions
are browned on top.  Cut into wedges and serve immediately.

Add a tomato and mixed greens salad and a fruit dessert to this
savory pie to make a delightful supper.
