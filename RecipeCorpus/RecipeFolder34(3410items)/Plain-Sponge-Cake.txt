Title: Plain Sponge Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 9" cakes
1 ts Cream of tartar
2 tb Cornstarch
1 3/4 c  All purpose white flour
10 tb Water
1/2 c  Shortening
1 1/3 c  White sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
Cream together the shortening & sugar.  Beat in the vanilla.  Stir in
the baking powder, cream of tartar & cornstarch.  Measure in the
flour & add the water.  Stir until well combined, but do not beat the
batter. If you are having problems mixing it, add a little more
water, but only add it 1 tablespoon at a time as the batter should
not be too wet. Turn batter into 2 prepared cake pans.

Bake at 375F for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from oven & cool for 10
minutes on wire racks.  Then turn out of pans onto racks & cool
completely.

Spread with jam & make a layer cake, topped with icing or, one way my
Mum used to serve such cakes was with a "butter" icing in the middle
& then powdered sugar sprinkled over the top.
