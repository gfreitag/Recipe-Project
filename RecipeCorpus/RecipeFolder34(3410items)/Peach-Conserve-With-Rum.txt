Title: Peach Conserve With Rum
Categories: Condiments, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
1/4    To 1/2 cup (60 - 120 mL)
Chopped maraschino cherries
1/2 ts (2.5 mL) salt
1/2 ts (2.5 mL) ground ginger
1/4 ts (1.25 mL) ground mace
1 md Sized seedless orange
1/2 c  (120 mL) light rum
2 qt (1900 mL) chopped peaches
6 1/2 c  (1560 mL) sugar
3 tb (45 mL) lime juice
1/4 c  (180 mL) crushed pineapple
Use sharp knife to remove thin yellow part of orange peel.  Finely
chop rest of orange, add just enough water to prevent sticking, and
cook until peel is tender.  Put opened container of rum in hot water.
Wash, drain, peel, coarsely chop and measure peaches.  With exception
of rum, mix all ingredients, including water in which orange was
cooked, and boil almost, but not quite, to jellying point.  Remove
from heat. Quickly skim off foam, stir in hot rum.  Pour hot, into
hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch (6 mm) head space.  Adjust caps.  Process
15 minutes in a boiling water bath canner. Yield:  2 or 3 pints (960
- 1440 mL).

Note:  When made without rum, this recipe yields a better than average
peach conserve.
