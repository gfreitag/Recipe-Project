prosciutto. Cut the remaining prosciutto into 1-by--inch strips.

salt and pepper. Reserve  cup of the dressing and set aside. Pour the
remaining vinaigrette into a medium nonreactive bowl. Add the fig
halves and mushrooms and toss gently. Let marinate for 30 minutes.

3. Light a grill or preheat the broiler. Remove the fig halves from
the marinade one at a time and wrap individually in the large strips
of prosciutto. Alternating with the mushrooms, thread 5 of the
wrapped fig halves onto each of four 10-inch long wooden skewers.
Grill or broil for about 1 minute on each side until lightly browned.
Transfer to a plate.

4. In a large salad bowl, toss the arugula with the reserved dressing.
Divide among 4 large salad plates. Arrange the prosciutto-wrapped
figs and mushrooms from 1 skewer on each salad. Garnish with edible
flower and the remaining small slivers of prosciutto. Serve
immediately.
