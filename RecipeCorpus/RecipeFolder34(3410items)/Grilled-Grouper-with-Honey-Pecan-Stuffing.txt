Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
-skinned and cut
-in 4 serving pieces
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
3/4 c  Pecan halves
3 tb Mild honey
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
1 1/2 lb (to 2 lb) grouper fillets
Preheat oven to 350F. Scatter the pecan halves in a baking pan and
toast in the oven until fragrant, shaking the pan occasionally, 7-10
minutes. Set aside to cool.

Finely chop the pecans and combine them in small bowl with the honey,
lemon juice and red pepper flakes. Stir to mix well.

Preheat the grill. Using a small sharp knife, cut a pocket into the
side of the grouper fillet pieces to within 1-inch of the edges.
Spoon the pecan-honey mixture into the pockets. Rub the fish on all
sides with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

Grill the fish until nicely browned, about 3-4 minutes, then turn and
continue cooking until opaque through, 3-5 minutes longer. Serve
immediately.

Note: you can also make this dish by coating the outside of the fish
with the chopped pecan-honey mixture.
