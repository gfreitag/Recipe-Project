Title: STRAWBERRY PRESERVES - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Dips/spread, Fruit, Microwave
Yield: 3 cups
1 tb Lemon juice
3 qt Fresh strawberries
3/4 c  Sugar
1. In large microwave-safe bowl, combine strawberries, sugar, and
lemon juice. Cover loosely and microwave on high (100 percent) 15
minutes.

2. Stir mixture to dissolve sugar. Microwave on high (100 percent),
uncovered, 50 minutes. Stir mixture well and check for doneness (see
Testing for Doneness).

3. Spoon preserves into jars and refrigerate or cool to room
temperature and spoon into plastic bags and freeze.

Testing for Doneness:  The recommended cooking times produce a thick
but not hard texture.  Test the preserves at the end of the cooking
time by placing a little of the preserves in a teaspoon and setting
the teaspoon in the freezer, uncovered, for five minutes.  Look at
the texture, and taste the cold preserves.  The preserves in the
spoon should be thick but not hard.  For a slightly thicker preserve,
microwave on high for another five minutes, then retest.  If you want
a slightly sweeter preserve, you can stir in a little more sugar and
then cook for another minute.
