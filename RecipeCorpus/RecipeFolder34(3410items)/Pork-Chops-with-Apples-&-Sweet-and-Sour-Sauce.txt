1/4 c  Flour
2 tb Oil (corn, peanut or

2 tb Finely chopped shallots
2 tb Red wine vinegar
3/4 c  Chicken broth (fresh OR

1 tb Honey

Sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper, then set aside.  Cut the
apples into quarters.  Peel the quarters and remove and discard the
cores.

Dredge the chops in the flour.  Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet
and cook the pork chops for about 5 minutes on one side, until well
browned. Turn the chops and cook for about 5 minutes on the other
side. Remove the chops from the skillet and set aside.

Add the apple quarters to the skillet and cook, turning often, for
about 2 minutes.  Remove the apples and drain off the fat from the
skillet. Add the shallots and vinegar to the skillet and cook briefly
while stirring with a wooden spoon.  Add the broth and honey.  Cook
for about 1 minute, then stir in the tomato paste.

Return the pork chops and the apple quarters to the skillet.  Bring
the sauce to a boil, then spoon the sauce over the chops and apples.
Cook, covered closely, for 10 minutes.  Transfer the pork chops and
apples to a serving dish and pour the sauce over them.

NOTE:  "You should hack away or have the butcher hack away the
backbone or chine bone of each chop, but leave the rib bone intact.
The ready-to-cook chops wil weigh about 2 1/4 pounds."

Makes 8 servings.
