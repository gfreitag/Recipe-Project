salt and pepper; coat with 1/3 cup flour, using all of the flour.
Working in 3 batches, brown beef in same pot over high heat, about 5
minutes per batch. Transfer meat to large bowl. Add onions and
carrots to same pot and saute until light brown, about 6 minutes. Add
garlic and saute 1 minute. Transfer vegetables to bowl with beef.

scraping up browned bits, about 8 minutes.  Return meat and
vegetables and their juices to pot.  Add wine, mushrooms, thyme,
sugar, tomato paste and 2 cups broth. Bring to boil, stirring
occasionally.  Cover pot and place in oven.  Cook until beef is
tender, about 1 hour 20 minutes.

liquid until reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 40 minutes.  Season with
salt and pepper. Pour liquid back over beef and vegetables. (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Rewarm over low heat before
serving.
