Spray a 3-quart saucepan or 12" nonstick skillet with vegetable

soft but not browned. Add 1/4 cup vegetable broth if needed to
prevent onion from browning. Add bell pepper, garlic, dried and fresh
tomatoes, basil and oregano. Saute, stirring, about 5 minutes.

Add rice; saute about 1 minute. Pour in 1/2 cup broth. Bring to a
boil; reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring constantly, until liquid
is almost completely absorbed. Add another 1/2 cup broth. Continue
stirring and adding broth 1/2 cup at a time as it is absorbed.

Stop adding broth when rice is creamy and just tender, about 30-35
minutes. Remove risotto from heat and stir in spinach. Add cheese if
desired and season to taste. Serve immediately. 6 servings.
