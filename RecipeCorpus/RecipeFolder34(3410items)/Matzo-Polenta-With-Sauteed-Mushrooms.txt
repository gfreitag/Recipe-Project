1. Lightly oil an 8-inch cake pan or straight-sided tart pan.

2. In a 2-quart saucepan, bring to a boil the chicken stock, milk,
bouillon cubes, and herbs. Reduce the heat and simmer until the
bouillon cubes are completely dissolved, about 3 mins.

3. Slowly pour the matzo meal into the liquid with one hand while
whisking constantly with the other. (Be sure to use a firm whisk.)
Continue whisking until smooth and creamy. The mixture will become
quite thick. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 mins, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking.

4. Beat the egg and egg yolk together in a bowl; whisk into the matzo
polenta. Raise the heat slightly and return the mixture to a boil.
Whisk constantly for 1 min., season with salt and pepper to taste,
and remove from heat.

5. Pour the cooked matzo polenta into the oiled pan. With a spatula,
spread the mixture evenly and smoothly. Cover, refrigerate, and chill
thoroughly, at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs.

6. Preheat the oven to 250 F. Cut the polenta into pie-shaped wedges.
In a large saute pan, heat the 1/3 cup olive oil over a moderate
flame. Dredge the matzo wedges in the extra matzo meal and saute on
both sides until golden brown. Transfer to an ovenproof platter and
hold, uncovered, in the oven while you cook the mushrooms.

7. Wipe the saute pan clean and heat the 2 Tbs. olive oil over high
heat until it just begins to smoke. Add the mushrooms and saute to
brown and soften them, 3 to 5 mins. Add the garlic, anchovy, white
wine, and lemon juice and toss together to blend the flavors. Season
with salt and pepper and cook 1 to 2 mins. Spoon the mushrooms and
their juice over the matzo polenta cakes and serve, sprinkled with
chopped parsley,
