Categories: Country liv, Holiday, Desserts, Puddings, Microwave
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Egg, lightly beaten
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 ts Finely grated lemon rind
1/2 c  Sugar
5 tb Cornstarch
1/8 ts Salt (opt.)
2 c  Low-fat (2%) milk
1. In 1-quart microwave-safe bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch, and
salt, if desired; stir in 1/4 C of the milk, mixing until cornstarch
dissolves. Add remaining milk. Microwave, uncovered, on high (100
percent) 3 minutes, whisking mixture well after 2 minutes.

2. Gradually stir egg into milk mixture until well blended. Stir in
lemon juice and lemon rind. Microwave mixture on medium (50 percent)
2 minutes, beating well after 1 minute; mixture should boil and
thicken. Taste to be sure cornstarch has cooked completely. If
starchy in flavor, microwave on medium (50 percent) 30 to 60 seconds
longer.

3. Strain pudding into four 5-oz custard cups or small serving bowls.
Set aside to cool slightly; serve warm.
