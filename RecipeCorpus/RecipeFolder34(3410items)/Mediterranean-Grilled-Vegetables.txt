Title: Mediterranean Grilled Vegetables
Categories: Vegetables, Bbq/grill
Yield: 12 servings
1 lb Zucchini squash
1 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  Italian seasoning
1 lb Large onion
1 lb Red bell pepper
1 lb Green bell pepper
1 lb Yellow squash
Peel onions and cut top-to-bottom in large wedges. Cut tops from bell
peppers, remove core, and cut in large top-to-bottom pieces. Trim
ends from squash and cut in diagonal rounds, about 1/2" thick. Toss
all vegetables in a large bowl with olive oil and seasoning, breaking
up the onion wedges somewhat. Place in a single layer on a very hot
grill (watch out for the flare-ups!) and grill, turning occasionally,
until peppers are slightly charred and veggies are tender (about 5
minutes). Serve immediately. These are also good refrigerated, then
microwaved to reheat. Submitted By RICHARD DOUVILLE   On   08-31-95
