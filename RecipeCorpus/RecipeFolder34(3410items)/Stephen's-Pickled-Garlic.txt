1 c  White vinegar

Here's something that might appeal those of you engaged in the Garlic
Thread.  It's not for everyone, but if you're a true garlic fan, these
munchies might be right up your alley.  Thai garlic comes in pods
that are about the same size as Western garlic but the cloves are
about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of ours and there are correspondingly more
in a head. The plus is that they don't have to be skinned before use.
The emphasis here is on the sour rather than the sweet.  Quite a
taste sensation.

In a medium saucepan, bring the vinegar, water, sugar and salt to a
boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Drop in the garlic.
Return to boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat.  Cool, and fill
sterilized, screw-top jars. Store in the refrigerator for at least 1
week before eating. Continue to refrigerate, tightly covered, between
serving.
