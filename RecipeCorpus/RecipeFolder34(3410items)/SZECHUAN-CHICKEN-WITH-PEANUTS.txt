Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Chinese
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Cornstarch
2/3 c  Water
1 ts Sugar
2    Egg whites
3 tb Oil
1/2 c  Dry roasted peanuts
2    Chicken breasts*
6 oz Snow peas
2/3 c  Soy sauce
1 ts Minced fresh ginger
5    Cloves minced garlic
1/2 tb Crushed red pepper
* whole boneless skinless

In a bowl  combine sherry; egg  whites, sugar, 1  Tbsp corn starch.
Mix ingredients well.  Cut chicken into bite size pieces and add to
egg white mixture; set aside. In another bowl combine the water, 1
Tsbp cornstarch, soy sauce.  Pre- heat wok or large saute skillet on
high heat. Add the 3 Tbsp  of  oil.    Add the crushed red pepper,
garlic and ginger.Cook for 30 seconds  and  add  chicken   mixture.
Cooking times vary according to appliance  used.  Cook  on high heat
until done, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat, add 1/2 cup of
peanuts.(I like to pulverize mine in a blender or  food  processor
first.    It  adds more of a peanutty flavor to the dish.)   Add the
snow peas and soy sauce mixture,cover and simmer until snow peas are
cooked to your taste. This dish is best served with plain white rice
and is even tastier as a leftover. (It microwaves well) ENJOY! !
