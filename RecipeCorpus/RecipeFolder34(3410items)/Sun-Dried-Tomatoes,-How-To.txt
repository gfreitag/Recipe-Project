The easiest way to make sundried tomatoes, assuming that you do not
have a food dehydrator is to dry them in your car.  Bear with me
while I explain this, because it is really simple. 1) Select tomatoes
in good condition that have been vine ripened.  Do not try to dry
store bought tomatoes because they have no flavor. 2) Prepare the
tomatoes by washing, then slicing into uniform 1/4 inch thick slices.
3) Get several cookie sheets and cover them with waxed paper.  Lay
the tomatoe slices on the waxed paper, but do not let the slices
overlap or touch. 4) In the morning take the sheets of tomatoes with
you in your car, and park in the open, so the sun will shine in all
day.  Place the sheets in the back window, or on the dash board. 5)
After the first day, turn each slice, and bring the trays in the
house at night. Repeat the drying process the next day. 6) Place the
dried slices in a glass jar and freeze for one week to make sure that
any insect eggs that may still be on the tomatoes are killed. 7) The
tomatoes can then be stored on the pantry shelf for up to one year.
After that time they turn dark, but still taste very good.
