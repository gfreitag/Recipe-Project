Categories: Country liv, Holiday, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground allspice
2 tb Butter
2 tb Pine nuts
4 lb Rutabagas, peeled and diced
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1. In 3-quart saucepan, place rutabagas and salt; add water to cover.
Cover saucepan and heat to boiling over high heat; reduce heat to low
and cook rutabagas until very tender-20 to 30 minutes.

2. Drain rutabagas, reserving cooking liquid. In same saucepan, with
potato masher or electric mixer, mash rutabagas until coarsely
chopped. Add cream, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice; beat, adding some
reserved cooking liquid, if necessary, to make a creamy but not
entirely smooth texture. If rutabagas have cooled, heat gently while
stirring constantly until hot. Spoon into serving dish.

3. In small skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add pine nuts and
saute, until they just start to brown; spoon over whipped rutabagas
and serve.
