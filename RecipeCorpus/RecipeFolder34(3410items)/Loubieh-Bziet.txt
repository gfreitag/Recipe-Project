Title: Loubieh Bziet
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Green beans, trimmed
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Olive oil
4 lg Onion(s), halved
-sliced 1/8" thick
(Green Beans with Onions)

In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. When the
oil is hot, add the onions. Saut for a few minutes, until the onions
turn translucent. Reduce the heat to low and cook the onions for
20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The onions should turn a rich
caramel color.

Rinse the beans in a colander; you want just a small amount of water
to cling to them. Add the beans to the onions; stir and cover the
pan. Keep the heat low and cook for about 45 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot or at room
temperature.
