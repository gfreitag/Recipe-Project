1 tb Butter
3/8 c  Yogurt
1/4 c  Water
1/4 ts Cumin seeds
3/4 ts Yeast

2 tb Onions, chopped
2 tb Butter
A flat bread from India.  Make sure your oven is well preheated.

Use dough cycle on machine.  Remove dough from machine and divide
into 6 parts.

Preheat oven to 500.  Roll each part into a small circle (about 8"
diameter) and place on greased pizza or other baking pan. Brush top
of each one with melted butter. Sprinkle finely chopped onion onto
dough. Note: Place piece of waxed paper on top of the circle and with
rolling pin, roll onions into dough. Bake 10-15 minutes until puffy
and brown.

Sylvia's notes: Yummmmmmmy!  However, 10 minutes in MY oven turned it
almost black; 5 minutes 30 seconds (at 475, since my oven runs a
little hot) turned the nan golden brown and perfect.  Also, I rolled
it too thin at first.  They came out much better when I didn't roll
them paper thin, more like 1/8" thin.  I put spoonsful of
Yogurt-Cucumber Salad on them; this is the best bread I've ever
tasted for eating-food-on. However, as delicious as it is, I doubt
I'll make it often; all the rolling and brushing with butter and
pushing onions in is just too much work.

Donna German's note:  While traditional "Nan" has onions, try
substituting 1-2 ts lemon or orange peel, anise or fennel seeds. Just
sprinkle on top of melted butter.
