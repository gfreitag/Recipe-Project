Title: Omelet Pizza
Categories: Pizza, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Green pepper -- sliced
3 lg Tomatoes -- sliced
4 oz Parmesan cheese -- gratedf
6    Eggs
4 tb Plain yogurt
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 lg Onion -- sliced
x  Black olives 2 ts Oregano x  Salt and pepper Whisk together the
eggs, yogurt, salt and pepper; heat half the oil in a large frying
pan; pour in the egg mixture and cook gently until lightly set
underneath. Turn on the grill and continue cooking the omelette this
way so that the top sets (be careful not to overcook it). At the same
time, saute the onion and pepper in the remaining oil until just
tender. Using the omelette as a pizza base, arrange the veggies,
tomatoes and olives across the top. Season, add herbs and sprinkle
with grated cheese. Returnthe omelette pizza to the grill for just a
few minutes more. Serve in slices. NOTE-you can cook a pizza dough in
the usual way, and the omelette as described above. Spread some
tomato puree or sauce over the cooked dough, chop the omelette into
fine strips and arrange them on top, sprinkle with cheese and grill
briefly.
