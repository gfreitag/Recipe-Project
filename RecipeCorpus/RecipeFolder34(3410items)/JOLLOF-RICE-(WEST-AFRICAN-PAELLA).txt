You can put in as many kinds of meat or vegetables as you like or can
afford into this dish. Shrimp makes an extravagant but wonderful
addition. Use a heavy pot or a large cast iron skillet to discourage
burning. Stirring often is the key to successwith this dish. Use a
large wooden spoon. Cover the pot tightly.

Skin, debone and chop the chicken into 1 inch square pieces. In a
heavey pot, large enough to hold everything, brown the chicken in
oil. Add onions and peppers. Cook over medium heat for 5 to 10
minutes.

Meanwhile, in a separate skillet, saute the shrimp in a small amount
of oil and precook the carrots, beans, and peas (or other vegetables
of your choice) until they are about half done ( 5 minutes or so).
Drain the vegetables and add to the chicken pot along with the
shrimp, tomatoes, salt, pepper and thyme. Reduce heat to low and
simmer for 5 minutes. Combine rice with tomato paste, which should
coat the rice grains without drowning them. (In the finished dish,
the rice should be tinted orange, too much tomato paste will make it
red.) Stir the coated rice to the pot and continue to simmer, adding
water sparingly, as needed, to avoid burning. When the meat, rice and
vegetables are tender, the Jollof Rice is ready to serve.
