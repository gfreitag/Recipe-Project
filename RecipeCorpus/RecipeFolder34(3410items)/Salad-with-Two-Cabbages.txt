Title: Salad with Two Cabbages
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Lemon juice
1 lb Celery cabbage
3 ea Kohlrabi; about 1-1/2 inches
-in diameter
1 md Onion
1/2 c  Parsley; chopped
Wash and drain the celery cabbage.  Cut it in half lengthwise and
remove the core.  If your celery cabbage is larger than 1 pound, cut
it into pieces and refrigerate the unused portions.  It keeps very
well under refrigeration.
For the salad, cut the cabbage into pieces as you would a head of
lettuce, with no piece larger than about 1-1/2 inches square.  Place
the cabbage pieces into a salad bowl.
Cut the leafy greens with their from the kohlrabi, reserving them
for another use (boiled or for soups). Rinse the bulbs and peel them.
With a sharp knife, cut the bulbs into matchstick pieces, no
longer than 1-1/4 inches.  Do not use a food processor for this.  Add
the strips to the cabbage.
Peel and slice the onion thin.  Break the slices into rings and
add them to the salad bowl along with the chopped parsley.  Toss just
to mix.
Sprinkle the salad with the salt and pepper and pour on the olive
oil, followed by the lemon juice.  Toss until the ingredients are
lightly coated with the oil and lemon juice.
If the salad is not to be served right away, it will hold for
several hours in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap.
