Soak the bread slices in the milk.  In a large bowl, mix together the
beef, eggs and parsley.  Gently squeeze the milk from the bread and
shred it as you add it to the meat mixture.  Add the cheeses and
pepper.  Form the meat mixture into 12 balls.  Place on a baking
sheet and refrigerate for 15 minutes.  Heat a large heavy skillet
over medium heat.  Add the oil. When hot, add the meatballs and cook,
turning, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.  If eating
immediately, cook about 10 minutes more. If you plan to add to a
sauce then remove from the pan with slotted spoon and add to sauce.
Simmer for 15 minutes more.
