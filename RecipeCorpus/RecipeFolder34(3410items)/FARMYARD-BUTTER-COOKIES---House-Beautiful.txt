-available at cake supply
-stores
2 c  Butter, room temperature
2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
2 tb Vanilla extract
6 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
In an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Add eggs and vanilla extract and blend well.

In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. Add dry
ingredients to the creamed mixture, beating slowly until well
incorporated. Batter will be sticky.

Turn one-third of the batter at a time onto a piece of plastic wrap,
enclose and pat into a rectangular shape. Chill until firm, at least 3
hours or overnight. Dough can be frozen for up to 6 months.

Roll dough out I/s-inch thick, one piece at a time, on a floured
board with a floured rolling pin. Dip 2-inch farmyard cookie cutters
into flour and cut out shapes. Place dough on parchment-lined cookie
sheets and bake in a preheated 350' oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or
until golden. Cool cookies on wire racks. Makes about 6 to 7 dozen
cookies.

Divide icing into several bowls and tint each portion with desired
color. Fill pastry bags half-full with icings, fit with #2 decorative
tips and pipe designs. Cookies need to set at least 12 hours after
decorating before storing in airtight containers.
