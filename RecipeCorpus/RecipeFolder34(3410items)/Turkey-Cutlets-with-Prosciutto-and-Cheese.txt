Title: Turkey Cutlets with Prosciutto and Cheese
Categories: Poultry, Cheese/eggs, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Butter, divided
4 sl Prosciutto or other ham (
-about 2 ounces)
2 ts Dried rosemary
1 tb Chopped shallots
1/4 lb Mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/4 c  Chicken broth
4    Turkey breast tenderloin
-steaks ( about 1 1/2
Pounds)
Salt, to taste (if desired)
Freshly ground pepper, to
-taste
1/4 lb Fontina, Gruyere or Cheddar
-cheese
Preheat the grill to High.   Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the
turkey pieces.  Cut the cheese into thin slices to fit neatly in a
single layer, overlapping slightly, on the turkey steaks.  Set the
cheese slices aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy skillet large enough to
hold the turkey steaks in a singel layer.  Add the steaks and cook
them for about 4 minutes, until nicely browned on 1 side.  Turn the
turkey pieces and top each with 1 thin slice of prosciutto and
sprinkle evenly with the rosemary.  Cover the skillet closely and
cook the turkey for about 3 minutes.

Transfer the prosciutto-topped turkey to a serving dish.  Add the
remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet and, ewhen it melts,
add the shallots. Cook briefly, stirring, then add the mushrooms.
Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.  Add the chicken broth and stir
well. Cook for about 1 minute over relatively high heat.

Meanwhile, cover the prosciutto-topped turkey steaks with equal
portions of the sliced cheese in a single layer.  Place them briefly
under the broiler until the cheese melts.  Pour the mushroom mixture
over the top and serve hot.

Makes 4 servings.
