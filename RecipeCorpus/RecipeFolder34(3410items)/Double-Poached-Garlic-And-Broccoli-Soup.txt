* To double-poach garlic, place the desired number of peeled garlic
cloves in a saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook
for 1 min. Drain and discard the poaching liquid. Return the garlic
to the saucepan with fresh water to cover and simmer for 15 to 20
mins, or until tender. Drain again. The garlic may be double-poached
days in advance. To keep, place in a jar, cover with olive oil, seal
tightly, and store in the refrigerator until needed. The garlic will
keep for up to 3 months.

1. Separate the broccoli florets from the stalks. Peel the stalks
with a vegetable peeler, dice, and set aside. Reserve 2 cups of the
florets separately.

2. Melt the butter in a large casserole over medium heat, add the
onion, and cook for 1 min. Whisk in the stock or bouillon and simmer
for 5 mins. Add the diced broccoli stalks and the remaining florets
and simmer for 20 mins, or until very tender.

3. Strain the soup and return the broth to the casserole. Puree the
vegetables together with the garlic and cream in a food processor.
Add to the broth and whisk until well blended. Add the reserved 2
cups florets and simmer until tender. Correct the seasonings and
serve hot, with optional garlic croutons and sprinkling of Parmesan.
