Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Choose sound crab apples (1 quart makes approximately three cups of
jelly). Wash and remove blossom end. Pull off stems, if any. Cut into
quarters but do not peel. Place in a heavy saucepan, barely cover
with water and bring to a boil. Boil until the fruit is tender when
pierced with a small sharp knife. Pour into a jelly bag and allow the
juice to drain overnight. For clear, sparkling jelly, do not squeeze
the bag. The following day, measure the juice and bring to a boil.
For each cup of juice, add 3/4 cup of sugar. Bring to a boil again
and boil rapidly to the jelly stage or until the liquid reaches 220
to 222-F on a candy thermometer. Skim and ladle into dry sterilized
jelly glasses, leaving 1/4-inch head room. Cover at once with a thin
layer of hot paraffin. Allow glasses to stand undisturbed until cool.
Cover with clean, dry metal lids. Optional: Add several washed sprigs
of rosemary to the syrup while it boils, then discard. Add one
freshly washed sprig to each jar before sealing. Source: Mom's old
