translucent. Stir in garlic, sherry, soy sauce, gingerroot, and salt.
Return chicken to skillet. Cover and simmer chicken over low heat 20
minutes or just until fork-tender, turning pieces occasionally.

cornstarch and water until smooth. Transfer cooked chicken to serving
platter; cover and keep warm.

4. Heat liquid remaining in skillet over high heat to boiling. Add
pea pods and cornstarch mixture; cook, stirring constantly, just
until pods are tender-crisp and sauce thickens. Stir in radishes and
