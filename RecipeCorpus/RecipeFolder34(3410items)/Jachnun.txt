Title: Jachnun
Categories: Middle east, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
1 lg Egg
1 1/4 c  Water
3/4 c  Margarine; cut into 6 pieces
3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor and
process to blend.  Add egg and 1 cup water and process with on/off
turns to mix. With motor running, gradually add remaining water,
about 1/4 cup, adding enough so mixture comes together to a smooth,
fairly stiff dough. It will be sticky.

Remove from processor.  Knead dough well by slapping vigorously on
the work surface.  Divide into 6 pieces and knead each one with a
slapping motion until smooth.  Roll each in your palm to a ball.  Put
on an oiled plate or tray, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate
for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Oil working surface and rolling pin.  Let margarine stand at room
temperature until very soft.  Roll out 1 ball of dough on oiled
surface to a very thin 12-inch square.  To help stretch dough, pull
it gently from time to time by hand, until very thin. If dough tears,
simply press it together.  Spread with a piece of soft margarine.
Fold in half, then in half again to make a long strip. Roll up strip
from a short side in a tight cylinder.  Repeat with 5 remaining
pieces of dough. Put in greased, shallow 8-inch square baking dish.
Cover with foil and a lid and refrigerate at least 2 or up to 8 hours.

Preheat oven to 200 F. Bake pastries 13-14 hours or until golden
brown. Serve hot.
