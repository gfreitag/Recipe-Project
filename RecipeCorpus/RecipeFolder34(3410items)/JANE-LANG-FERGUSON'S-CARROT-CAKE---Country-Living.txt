1. Heat oven to 350'F. Grease and flour two 9-inch-round cake pans.

2. In large bowl, beat eggs, sugar, oil, and vanilla until combined.
Add flour, cinnamon, and baking soda; stir until batter is smooth.
Gently fold in carrots.

3. Spoon batter evenly into prepared pans. Bake cake layers 30 to 35
minutes or until centers spring back when gently pressed with
fingertip. Cool cake layers in pans on wire racks 5 minutes. Remove
from pans and cool completely on wire racks. Prepare Cream-Cheese
Frosting.

4. When layers are completely cooled, place 1 layer on serving plate
and spread some of frosting over top. Place other layer on top of
frosting on first layer. Frost side and top of cake. Garnish with
pecans. Refrigerate leftovers.

Cream-Cheese Frosting: In large bowl with electric mixer, beat 1/2
cup (1 stick; butter, softened, and 1 8-ounce pack- age cream cheese,
softened, until smooth. Slowly beat in 1 16-ounce package (3 1/2
cups) confectioners' sugar until combined.

Note: Be sure to use self-rising all-purpose flour, not self-rising
cake flour, which will cause this cake to sink in the center. If
unavailable, substitute 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking
powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt for the 2 cups self-rising flour.
