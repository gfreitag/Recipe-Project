Title: Australian Pork With Port And Coffee Sauce
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Salsa/sauce, Down under
Yield: 8 servings
2 ts Sugar
1/4 c  Water
2 ts Cornstarch
4 3/8 lb Pork loin, boned
1 c  Strong coffee
1/2 c  Cream
1/3 c  Port
Preheat oven to 350F. Remove rind from pork and trim fat to make a 1
cm layer. Roll and tie the meat. Weight pork and calculate cooking
time, allow 25-30 mins. per 500 gr. Place meat in roasting pan. Roast
pork for 30 mins.

Combine coffee, 1/4 c. cream, 1/4 c port & sugar, pour over pork.
Continue roasting pork for calculated cooking time, basting pork
every 15 mins with coffee mixture. This basting gives the outside a
beautiful golden glaze & helps to keep the meat moist.

Remove pork from oven when cooked. Keep covered in a warm place while
making the sauce.

Skim fat from the pan juices. Place juices in a small saucepan with
water, remaining 1/4 c cream, remaining port and cornstarch. Cook
until thickened, strain.

Slice pork thinly and place a tablespoon or two of sauce on each
serving. Remaining sauce should be available for guests to add more.
