Title: Richard's Simplest BBQ Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Brown sugar
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Chili sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Medium onion, chop fine
2 tb Oil
1/4 c  Lemon juice
2 tb Vinegar
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
Brown chopped onion in oil, in a medium saucepan. Add remaining
ingredients, bring to a low boil over medium-high heat, then reduce
to a simmer.  Simmer 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

This is a variable sauce, and works well with either molasses or maple
syrup instead of brown sugar (use 1/4 cup maple syrup).  Also, minced
chilies or green bell pepper may be sauteed along with the onion.
Sauce may be made thicker/chunkier; sauce may be made thinner.  A
couple of drops of liquid smoke (no more!) may be added.
