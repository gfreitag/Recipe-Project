Categories: Country liv, Appetizers
Yield: 20 pieces
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
4 oz Parmigiano Reggiano, at
-room temperature
2 md Sweet red peppers
2 md Sweet yellow peppers
1 md Sweet green pepper
3    Cloves garlic, unpeeled
1 md Loaf round Italian bread
1. Heat oven to 450'F. Place whole peppers and garlic on rimmed baking
sheet. Bake peppers and garlic 30 minutes, turning peppers every 10
minutes. Remove vegetables from oven. Set aside garlic and carefully
place peppers in brown paper bag; close bag tightly allowing peppers
to steam and cool-about 20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, reduce oven temperature to 350'F. Cut bread into 11
slices, each about 1/2 inch thick. Place the 2 end slices on
ungreased baking sheet. Cut remaining 9 slices in half and place
pieces on sheet. Toast bread 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.

3. When peppers are cool, peel, halve, and seed; chop peppers into
1/4-inch cubes. Peel garlic cloves. In medium bowl, crush garlic with
back of wooden spoon. Add peppers, oil, and vinegar; toss to combine.

4. Divide pepper mixture among toasted bread. With cheese slicer or
vegetable peeler, shave 1 1/2-to 2-inch-long curls of Parmigiano
Reggiano onto each piece of bruschetta. Arrange bruschetta on platter
and serve.
