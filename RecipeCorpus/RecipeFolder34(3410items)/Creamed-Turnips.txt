Title: Creamed Turnips
Categories: Israeli
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Grated hard cheese
- I use Kashkaval
Salt and pepper
6 sm Turnips
1 tb Vinegar
2 tb Butter
1 c  Heavy cream
Peel and thinly slice the turnips.  Cover in water, add vinegar and
cook 15 minutes on low heat.  Drain.

Preheat oven to 360 F (180 C).

Butter a baking dish, and arrange the turnip slices in one layer. Mix
the heavy cream with salt and pepper, and pour into the dish. Bake
about 45 minutes, until most of the cream has been absorbed by the
turnips. Sprinkle with grated cheese, and bake a few minutes more,
until golden. Serve immediately.
