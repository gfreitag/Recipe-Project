AIR BUBBLES: Use a dinner knife or spatula handle to slide down
inside of jar to remove any trapped air bubbles.

FRUIT: Since under-ripe fruit contains more pectin than ripe fruit,
try to include some if possible when making jams, jellies and
marmalades. Marmalade can take a week to set, jellies up to 24 hours.
HOT WATER BATH: Half fill canner with hot water.  Place jars in rack.
Lower rack to bottom. Pour in enough boiling water (not directly onto
jars) to cover tops with 2 inches of water.  Cover. Bring to a boil.
Start timing. If needed, add boiling water to keep up level.  Only
foods, such as fruits and tomatoes, with high acid content can be
processed in a hot water bath rather than using a pressure canner.
JELLY DIDN'T SET: The easiest and quickest remedy is to melt jelly
down until hot. Soften on 1/4 oz envelope of unflavored gelatin in
1/4 cup water for 1 minutes. Stir into hot jelly to dissolve. This
will set about 3 cups of jelly. Rebottle and re-seal. OPEN KETTLE:
Jams, jellies, salsa's, chutneys, relishes and kethcup, are cooking
in a large pot or preserving pan.  The heavier the pot, the better.
The boiling hot food is poured into hot sterilized jars and sealed
immediately. PRESSURE CANNING: Follow directions that are with your
pressure canner. ROLLING BOIL: A boil that cannot be stirred down.
STANDING TIME: Pickles should be allowed to stand for a few weeks
before using so flavors mingle. STERILIZING: Use you dishwasher to
run jars through regular cycle to sterilize.  Fill jars while they
are still hot.  Another method is to place open jars upside down in
3-4 inches of boiling water in a large pot. Allow to boil for 10
minutes.  Leave jars in water until you are ready to fill them.
