Title: Fake Kentucky Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Salsa/sauce, Salads
Yield: 6 servings
-used right from the
-package.
3 tb Flour
2 ts Salt (that's not too much)
1/4 c  Lemon juice (or vinegar)
2 tb Margarine or cooking oil
3 lb Chicken fryer parts
-Make a paste of the
-following:
2 pk Good Seasonings Italian or
-Mild Italian Salad Dressing
-mix
Spread this paste evenly over chicken pieces; stack in a bowl; cover
and refrigerate at least two hours or better yet, overnight. About 1
hour before serving, heat about 1 1/2 pints cooking oil in heavy
saucepan (9 inches in diameter, with depth of oil about 3 inches) to
a temperature of 425 degrees. I prefer my Oster Super Cooker--but
using an electric deep fryer I would have the temperature at 400
degrees.

Put about 2 cups milk or Club Soda or beer in a deep, narrow bowl &
dip each piece chicken in the liquid, letting the excess drip off.
Dust lightly but evenly in Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour (or a good
brand). DO NOT OVERCOAT!!!

Dry pieces a few minutes without letting them touch each other. Fry
few pieces at a time. Place on a cookie sheet without letting them
touch each other and bake uncovered 350 degrees 30 minutes.

Serves about 6 to 8 people. I encourage you to experiment with amount
of salad dressing mix according to your own taste preferences. But
much of it washes off in milk so 2 pkgs needed!
