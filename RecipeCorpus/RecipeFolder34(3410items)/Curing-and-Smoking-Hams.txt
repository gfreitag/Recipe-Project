1/4 c  Sugar

There are two ways to cure a ham before smoking it: brining and dry-
curing. Dry-curing is easier for the amateur, the resulting ham is
more tolerant to fluctuating temperatures during processing and it is
less salty. Hams should ideally be cured and stored at a temp of 36
to 40 F.

To dry-cure ham, allow the meat to cool naturally as rapidly as
possible. Cut into large pieces and leave some skin on for the meat
hooks to go into or the weight of the meat might tear the flesh.
Spread the pieces on a rack with no touching or overlapping. Sprinkle
them lightly with salt. When cool, rub them repeatedly with the
spiced sugar- salt mixture. Make sure every surface is coated. then
pack in salt. Allow three days per pound [per piece].

Hang the hams in the smoke house or a large smoker, so that they don't
touch each other. Allow three days to smoke and dehydrate and do not
let the temp go over 120 F. When cool, one old-fashioned way to store
them is to wrap in a cloth and bury them in a wooden box in the wood
ashes from the smoker. The ashes will deter moisture and insects and
intensify the smoked taste. They can also be refrigerated at least 3
weeks and frozen for up to 3 months. A heavily smoked, spiced and
dehydrated ham like Prosciutto needs no refrigeration.
