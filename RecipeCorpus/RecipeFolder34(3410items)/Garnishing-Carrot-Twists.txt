The secret to making this delightful garnish is soaking them in a salt
water solution.  The carrot twist has much eye appeal when used in a
salad or when placed as a garnish for a sandwich plate. 1. To make
this garnish, cut off the tip end of a fat carrot.

2. Follow the same procedure for making the carrot curl, but instead
or curling the strip, cut it into 3 inch lengths.

3. Cut a 1 inch slot down the center of each 3 inch strip.  Soak these
strips in the salt water solution for about 15 minutes.  This will
soften the strips enough to work with.

4. Insert one end of the strip through the center slot and gently
pull it straight back to form the twist. Soak the finished twists in
ice water to set the shape.
