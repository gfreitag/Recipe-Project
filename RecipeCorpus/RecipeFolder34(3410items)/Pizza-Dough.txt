Title: Pizza Dough
Categories: Pizza, Breads
Yield: 16 servings
1 ts Sugar
1 1/4 c  Lukewarm water
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Warm water
1 pk Yeast
4 1/4 c  Sifted flour
1 ts Salt
Pour warm water into a large bowl, sprinkle in yeast and stir to
dissolve. Mix in 2 cups of the flour, the salt and the sugar.  Add
lukewarm water and oil and beat until smooth.  Mix in remaining flour
and knead on a lightly floured board until elastic.  Shape into a
ball, turn into a greased bowl and turn over greased side up.  Let
rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Divide Dough in half; freeze half in an airtight container or plastic
bag if you're making only one pizza. Form dough into a ball and let
rest 5 minutes.  Roll out into a disk.  Add desired toppings and bake
pizza at 425 degrees for 15 minutes.
