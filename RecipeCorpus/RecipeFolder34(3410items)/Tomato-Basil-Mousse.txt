2 tb Olive oil
3 tb Gelatine
Few drops Tabasco (optional)
1/2 c  Vodka (optional)
1 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper
2 lb Tomatoes
1 lg Onion; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced

MMMMM----------------------RED PEPPER SAUCE---------------------------
2    Garlic cloves, minced (opt.)
Salt and pepper
2 lb Red bell peppers
2 tb Olive oil
pn Chopped basil
Peel and seed the tomatoes. Chop coarsely.

Heat the olive oil in a large pan, and saute the onion and garlic
until transparent. Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar,
basil leaves, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Cook on low heat for one
hour. Transfer to a food processor and process to a smooth puree.

Put half a cup of the mixture in a small pan with the gelatine and
bring to boil, ensuring that the gelatine completely dissolves. Mix
well with the rest of the mixture, and cool over a large bowl full of
ice cubes. If desired, add the Tabasco and vodka at this stage.

Whip the heavy cream until stiff. When the tomato mixture is thick
enough, gently fold the whipped cream into it.

Divide the mousse into individual serving cups. Refrigerate several
hours before serving. Serve cold with red pepper sauce.

RED PEPPER SAUCE: Grill the peppers, turning frequently, until
charred. Transfer to a paper bag for 20-30 minutes, then peel.
Transfer to a blender and process to a smooth puree. Add the other
sauce ingredients, and let the sauce stand for an hour or more in
room temperature. Serve at room temperature.
