Title: BEIGNETS - Country Cooking
Categories: Country coo, Breakfast
Yield: 15 beignets
1/8 ts Salt
4 1/2    To 5 C unsifted all-purpose
-flour
1 tb Butter, melted
Vegetable oil for frying
Confectioners' sugar
1/2 c  Milk
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water (105'F to 115'F)
1/4 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1. In small saucepan, heat milk just until bubbles appear around side
of pan. Remove from heat; cool to room temperature. (Do not boil.)

2. In large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add cooled milk, the
sugar, egg, nutmeg, and salt. With wooden spoon, gradually beat in 3
C flour and the butter until batter is smooth. Stir in enough of
remaining flour until a nanageable dough forms. Turn dough out onto
floured surface and knead, adding remaining flour, if necessary,
until smooth and elastic-about 5 minutes.

3. Wash, dry, and oil the same bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning the dough to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; set
aside in warm place and let dough rise until double in size-about 1
flour.

4. On lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 15 by 10-inch
rectangle, about 1/4, inch thick. Cut dough into 3 1/2 by 3 inch
rectangles. Set rectangles on baking sheet in a warm place and let
rise until double in size-about 45 to 55 minutes.

5. In large electric skillet or deep-fat fryer with temperature set at
350F, heat 2 inches oil. Fry beignets in hot oil, turning until
puffed and golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar. Serve warm.
