1/2 ts Salt
3 lb Skinned chicken legs

Using a meat cleaver, cut each chicken piece into 3 or 4 pieces. Set
aside.

In a large heavy saucepan, scatter the vegetables, bay leaf, thyme,
and parsley. Add the chicken pieces and enough cold water to cover by
about 3 inches. Over moderate heat, bring the water to a simmer.
Reduce heat to maintain a low simmer. Skim the surface of the water
periodically until the liquid is almost clear.

Over moderately low heat, continue to simmer stock for 3 hours or
until the liquid is reduced by half.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Ladle the stock into the
strainer. Transfer the bones to the strainer to drain. Discard the
bones. Stir in the salt.

Freeze the stock for about 20 minutes until the fat rises to the
surface and congeals. Skim off fat with a spoon. The stock will keep
refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for several months. Makes 1 quart.
