ABOUT 1 HOUR BEFORE SERVING:

1. Preheat oven to 450F. Separate garlic into cloves, removing any
loose papery skin, but do not peel. In large roasting pan (17" by 11
1/2" "), toss garlic cloves with 2 teaspoons olive or salad oil.
Cover roasting pan with foil and roast garlic 15 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, remove skin from all chicken pieces except wings. Cut
each breast piece in half.

3. In large bowl, mix rosemary, salt, lemon juice, pepper, and 1 T
olive or salad oil; add chicken and toss until well coated. Place
chicken in roasting pan with garlic. Roast 15 minutes, uncovered,
basting chicken once or twice with drippings.

4. While chicken is roasting, with kitchen shears, cut along back of
each shrimp, exposing vein, but keeping shell intact.* Rinse each
shrimp under running cold water to remove vein. Pat shrimp dry, with
paper towels.

5. After chicken has roasted 15 minutes, add shrimp to chicken
mixture, tossing to coat shrimp with drippings in pan. Roast 10
minutes longer, uncovered, or until shrimp turn opaque throughout and
juices run clear when chicken is pierced with a knife.

6. To serve, arrange chicken, shrimp, and garlic on platter. Spoon pan
drippings over. Garnish with rosemary. Makes 6 main dish servings.

*We like to cook the shrimp in the shclls. It retains more of the
shrimp flavor and makes the dish 1 k even prettier. If you prefer,
shell and de,ioo n shrimp before adding them tc; the roasting pan.
