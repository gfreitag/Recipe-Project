1/2 ts Thyme, chopped
1/8 ts Fennel seeds
1 pn Saffron threads (opt)
2 lb Ripe plum tomatoes

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. In a roasting pan, toss the tomatoes

charred.

2. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tbs oil in a large nonreactive
saucepan over moderate heat. Add the carrots, onion and mushrooms and
cook, stirring often, until slightly softened and beginning to color,
about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute
longer. Stir in the wine, tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme, fennel
seeds, saffron and roasted tomatoes. Pour in 6 cups of water and
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low, cover partially
and simmer for 30 minutes. Let cool completely; strain stock,
pressing on the solids with a large spoon to extract as much liquid
as possible.

month.)
