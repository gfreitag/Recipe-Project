Title: CHEF VINCENT'S APPLE TARTS - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Desserts, Fruit, Pie/tart
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Butter, melted
2 tb Granulated sugar
Confectioners' Sugar (opt.)
1/2    17 1/4-oz package frozen
-puff pastry
2 md Granny Smith apples
1. Thaw puff pastry following package directions. On lightly floured
surface, roll out puff pastry sheet to a 13 1/2-inch square. With
3-inch-round cookie cutter, cut out four rows of 4 pastry rounds,
creating a total of 16 rounds. Transfer rounds to ungreased baking
sheet; refrigerate while preparing apples.

2. Heat oven to 350'F. Peel and core apples; quarter apples and slice
into 1/4 inch-thick wedges.

3. Brush pastry rounds with butter and sprinkle with 1 T granulated
sugar. Top each round with 2 or 3 apple wedges, brush again with
butter and sprinkle with remaining granulated sugar. Bake 25 to 30
minutes or until pastry is golden brown and apples are tender.

4. To assemble individual tarts, stack four apple-topped rounds for
each tart, inverting the last one so the flat pastry bottom becomes
the top of the tart. Repeat with remaining rounds. Dust tarts with
confectioners' sugar, if desired, and serve.
