Title: Low-Calorie Blueberry Muffins
Categories: Muffins, Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 muffins
1/2 c  Skim milk
2 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
-melted
1 c  Blueberries
1/4 ts Freshly grated lemon peel
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
Heat oven to 375F.  Grease muffin cups--or to eliminate even the few
calories from greasing, use foil or paper baking cups.

Thoroughly mix flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.

Beat egg with a fork or whisk in a small bowl.  Whisk in milk and
butter. Pour over dry ingredients.  Add berries and lemon peel.  Fold
in with a rubber spatula just until dry ingredients are moistened.

Scoop batter into muffin cups.  Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until
lightly browned.  Cool 5 minutes before removing from pans.

Try making these muffins with finely chopped peaches, plums or
raspberries. Small blueberries work best.
