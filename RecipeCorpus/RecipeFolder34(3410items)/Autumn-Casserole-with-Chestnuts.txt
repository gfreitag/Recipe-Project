Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 pt Stock
1    Bay leaf
3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
3 ts Chopped fresh thyme
1 tb Shoyu
Salt and pepper
1 tb Sunflower oil
12 oz Leeks; trimmed and diced

12 oz Parsnips; trimmed and diced
12 oz Carrots; peeled and diced
2 oz Chestnuts
MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
Extra chopped parsley
Chestnuts work well with root vegetables and also make this casserole
more of a meal. l like to puree some of the cooked mixture to make the
background texture more substantial. As with most dishes of this
kind, they are best made the day before and reheated. Serve this with
green vegetables and baked potatoes for a complete meal. 1. Heat the
oil and gently fry the leeks and celery until fairly soft. Add the
root vegetables and chestnuts and cook for a few minutes, stirring
well.

2. Pour over the stock and mix in the herbs. Add the shoyu. Bring the
casserole to the boil, simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until all the
vegetables and chestnuts are quite soft.

3. Remove approximately a cup full of vegetables and liquid. Puree
this until smooth, then stir back into the casserole. Season to
taste. Then serve garnished with the extra chopped parsley.
