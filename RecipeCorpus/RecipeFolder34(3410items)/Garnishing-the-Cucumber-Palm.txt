The cucumber palm tree is an ideal center piece for a Luau Spread.
The trunk of the palm tree can be made from either a cucumber,
zucchini or carrot.  Each of these vegetable will easily spread open
to resemble the bark of the palm tree.  The palm tree should be made
at least 1 day ahead to give the leaves and trunk enough time to
spread and curl.

1. To make the trunk of the tree, use the paring knife and cut small
round gashes into the skin of the vegetable.  Start at the bottom of
the vegetable and continue cutting the gashes arund and up to the top
end. Alternate the cuts to give the trunk a more realistic look.

2. After all the cuts have been made, cut one end of the vegetable to
creat a flat surface so the trunk can stand up.  Place the finished
trunk into ice water and let stand at least 1 day to open.  For the
leaves of the palm tree, use a green bell pepper.  Select a pepper
which a 3 inch 'rounds' on the top. Cut these rounds into oval shapes
but be careful not to cut into the top section which holds the rounds
together. Make a series of diagonal cuts, close together, into but
not all the way to the center of each oval leaf.

3.  When ready to assemble the palm tree, slice a potato in half
lengthwise.  Place one half of the potato with the flat side down.
Use 2 or 3 toothpicks and push them into the potato at the spot the
palm tree is going to be placed.  Set the flat end of the cucumber
trunk down onto the protruding toothpicks.  Place the pepper leaves
on top of the trunk and secure with another toothpick.
