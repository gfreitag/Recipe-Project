Variations - Ecuadorians are very fond of adding beans to their
salsa. The most popular beans are the lupini, which are large white
beans about the size of lima beans. Just add the cooked beans
directly to the salsa. Or, add 1 teaspoon peanut butter with the
chiles in the blender and follow the above recipe.
Substitute yellow wax hot chiles or jalapenos if the aji chiles are
not available.
