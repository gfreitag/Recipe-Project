using 16 of reserved pecans, the almonds, walnuts, and hazelnuts.
Place remaining 3 pecans in center of pie in a spoke design.

4. Bake pie 40 to 45 minutes or until center is just set. Cool pie to
room temperature on wire rack. To serve, cut pie into 10 pieces;
refrigerate leftovers.

Flaky Pastry: In medium-size bowl, combine 1 1/4 C unsifted
all-purpose flour and 1/4 t  salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives,
cut in 6 table- spoons butter and 2 T vegetable shortening until
mixture resem- bles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle 1 to 2 T cold water over
flour mixture and mix lightly with fork. (Add water only until pastry
holds together when lightly pressed.) Form pastry into a ball; wrap
and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
