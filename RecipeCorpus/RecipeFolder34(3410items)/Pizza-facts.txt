Lisa, hubby (who worked in a pizza joint many moons aog) confirmed
what I thought was right - you're not letting the dough rest as much
as a pizza parlor does.  They make up the dough the night before and
refrigerate it overnight.  I know that the second batch (my recipe
makes two) that has been frozen and thawed has much more elasticity,
so I'd say your best bet is to make the dough far in advance and
freeze or refrigerate it until an hour or so before you're planning
to make the pizza.  I wouldn't toss it - my luck, it'd be the day I
hadn't washed the kitchen floor and you know where it would land when
I inevitably dropped it.  I take the dough in one hand and using the
other, pull the top of the dough and tuck it under, rotate, pull and
tuck, rotate, etc., until the top is smooth and the dough is
perfectly round, then I let it rest about 10 minutes, transfer it to
the cornmeal coated pizza peel (I use a pizza stone) and roll it out
with a rolling pin.  It comes out just the right shape, and there's
no need to build up a lip around the edge, either. From: ALISON MEYER
