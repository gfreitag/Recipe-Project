Categories: House beaut, Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 4 dozen
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
12 tb (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted
-butter, cut into small
-pieces
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Unsalted natural (not red
-dyed) pistachio nuts,
-lightly toasted
1/2 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg yolk
In a shallow baking pan in a preheated 350'F oven, toast pistachios 8
to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool completely. Working
with a few at a time, rub pistachios between your hands to remove
loose pieces of hull. Set aside 1 1/2 T for decoration.

In a food processor process remaining pistachios and sugar until very
fine. Add egg yolk and vanilla and process until blended. Sprinkle
butter over mixture and pulse until smooth. Add flour and process
just until combined.

Divide dough in halF RoU out each portion between sheets of waxed
paper to 1/8-inch thickness, checking the underside and smoothing out
any creases that form. Slide sheets onto a large tray and chill 20
minutes, or until firm but not hard.

Remove 1 dough sheet from the refrigerator and peel the bottom sheet
of waxed paper and replace it loosely. Turn dough over; remove and
discard top layer of waxed paper. Using a 2-inch round cutter, cut
out cookies. Reroll dough scraps and continue cutting until all dough
is used. (If the dough becomes too soft to handle, chill again.)
Repeat the process with the second dough sheet.

Finely chop reserved pistachios and sprinkle lightly over the center
tops of each cookie. Pat down nuts.

Bake in the center of a preheated 350'F oven 9 to 11 minutes, or until
golden all over. Remove from oven and let stand 2 minutes, transfer
to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up
to 10 days or up to 1 month. Makes about 4 dozen cookies.
