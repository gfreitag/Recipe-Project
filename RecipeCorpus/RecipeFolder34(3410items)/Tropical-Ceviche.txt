Marinade
Recipe by: Simply Seafood Combine the marinade ingredients in a large
glass or stainless stell mixing bowl. Whisk together and set aside.
Rinse the fish and scallops in cold water and pat dry with paper
towels. Add the scallops to the marinade and refrigerate.  Dice the
fish into 1/2" pieces and add to the marinade with the onions.
Gently stir, cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
Stir occasionally to ensure that the mearinade penetrates the seafood
evenly.  The ceviche may be prepared to this point up to 2 days in
advance.  About 30 minutes before serving, stir in the cilantro and
fruits and return the dish to the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Serve in small chilled bowls or plates or, for a more festive look,
shot glasses or cocktail tumblers.
