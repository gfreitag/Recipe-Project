Title: Hearty Roasted Vegetables
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 12 servings
1 lb Parsnips
1 c  Vegetable oil
1/3 c  Lemon pepper
2 tb Salt, or to taste
1 lb Large onions
1 lb Rutabagas
1 lb Potatoes
1 lb Carrots
Peel and cut onions in large wedges. Peel and cut rutabagas into
thumb-size chunks. Scrub and cut potatoes into thumb-size chunks.
Peel and cut both carrots and parsnips into 1/2"-thick diagonal
chunks.

In a large bowl toss cut veggies with lemon pepper and salt.  If
you're using a lemon pepper blend with the salt in it, omit the extra
salt.

Spread on baking sheets in single layer.  It helps to line the baking
sheets with parchment paper.

Roast at 425 degrees for 35 to 50 minutes, till golden brown and
tender. Serve hot.

Rutabagas are members of the turnip family and are frequently
referred to as yellow turnips.  Parsnips are sometimes referred to as
white carrots, but they are not carrots.  Both are vegetables
commonly found in American markets in the fall.  You can use this
method with most any firm vegetable that normally takes a few minutes
to boil/steam cook: green beans work very well here, as do various
other root vegetables. Submitted By RICHARD DOUVILLE   On   08-31-95
