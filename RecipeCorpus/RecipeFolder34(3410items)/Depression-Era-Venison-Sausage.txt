Quarts)
2 tb Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 ts Allspice
Sausage casings
4 lb Venison
1 lb Beef
2 lb Lean pork
1 lg Onion
1/2    Peck potatoes (about 4
Grind together all the meats with the onion. Next grind the potatoes
and mix them with the meats. Add spices and mix thoroughly. Use a
sausage stuffer, fill casings, but not too full. Tie the ends with
string; put into a large kettle of cold water and bring to a boil.
Cook for about 1 hour, being sure to prick each sausage with a fork
after boiling 10 minutes. Drain and cool. Tastes best when fried in
butter till casings are a light brown. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
