1.  Carrot sticks are a very popular vegetable in a relish tray and
offer a pleasing contrast in color and crunch when mixed with other
vegetables. To make the carrot sticks, select a fat, squatty carrot.
Cut off about 1/2 inch of the root end and stem end.  Wash the
vegetable in cold water. With a small knife cut long strips (about
1/4 inch thick) the full length of the carrot.  Keep the cuts as even
and straight as possible.

2. Cutting the vegetable this way should produce wide strips which are
then laid flat to be sliced again into 4 inch strips.  Trim each
carrot stick to a length of about 3 inches.  if the carrot sticks are
placed in ice water they will curl around to form half circles.
These half circles can be arranged so that they form an orange
vegetables ring in a relish tray for holding black and green olives.

For another attractive munchie on a sandwich plate or relish tray you
can use the carrot sticks to make edible dumb bells by simply putting
a pitted olive on each end of a carrot stick.  You can also put a
small amount of cream cheese into the pitted olive to hold the carrot
stick securely.

Another variation of the carrot and olive combination is the carrot
bundle. These are made by threading a few carrot sticks through a
pitted black or green olive to form a vegetable bundle with is
temptingly easy to munch on. The carrot bundle also adds a nice
garnish to individual sandwich plates.
