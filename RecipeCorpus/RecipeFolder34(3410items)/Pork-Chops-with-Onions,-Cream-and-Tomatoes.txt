Categories: Meats, Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
-slivered
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 c  Heavy cream (OR as desired)
2 tb Butter (OR as needed)
3 lb Pork chops
1 cn Tomatoes (16 ounces)
2    Or 3 Spanish onions (large),
Melt the butter in a 12- to 15-inch skillet over moderate heat and
brown the pork chops for about 15 minutes.  Remove the chops and set
aside. (If necessery, brown the chops in 2 batches.)

Drain the tomatoes and save the juices.  Cut the tomatoes into
slivers. Pour the juices into the skillet and stir to remove the
brown bits from the bottom.  Return all of the pork chops to the
skillet, making 2 layers if they are thin.

Mix the slivered onions and tomatoes together.  Pour the mixture over
the pork chops and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Cover the
skillet securely and cook the chops over low heat for about 2 hours
or until the meat is almost falling but not quite off the bones.

Remove the pork chops to a serving platter and keep warm.  Add the
cream to the skillet.  Raise the heat and boil the mixture hard,
stirring constantly, until it has a viscous, saucelike consistency.
Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour over the pork
chops and serve.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
