Title: Teatime Meringues - GH_9405
Categories: Desserts, Good housek
Yield: 4 servings
1 pt Strawberries
1/2 pt Raspberries
1/2 pt Blackberries
Mint sprigs for garnish
4 lg Egg whites
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Seedless red raspberry jam
Line large cookie sheet (17" by 14") with foil. Using 3-inch standard
star-shape cookie cutter as a guide, with toothpick, trace 4 evenly
spaced star outlines on foil, leaving at least 3 inches space all
around each star.

In small bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat egg whites and cream of
tartar until soft peaks form. Sprinkle in sugar, 2 tablespoons at a
time, beating well after each addition until sugar dissolves and
whites stand in stiff, glossy peaks.

Preheat oven to 200'F. Spoon two-thirds of meringue into decorating
bag fitted with coupler and large star tube. Pipe meringue around
out- line of the traced stars on foil to make four stars, each about
5 to 6 inches wide. Fill centers of stars with meringue.

Change tube on decorating bag to medium star tube; spoon remaining
meringue into bag. Pipe a slightly smaller star on top of each
existing star. With spoon, form small indentation in center of each
meringue star.

Bake stars 3 hours or until meringues are crisp but not brown. Cool
completely on cookie sheet on wire rack. If not using stars right
away, store in tightly covered container.

About 1O minutes before serving, in medium bowl, stir raspberry jam
until smooth. Cut each strawberry into quarters. Add all berries to
bowl with jam; toss to coat. On each of 4 dessert plates, spoon fruit
compote over meringue stars; garnish with mint sprigs.
