remove and keep warm. Add pork or ham and brown lightly; add onion,
green pepper, garlic, tomatoes and seasoning; cook, stirring
occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and all liquid has
evaporated; lift out with a slotted spoon. Add the rice to the pan
and cook, stirring, until hot and coated with remaining oil; add
water and saffron liquid and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat
and put chicken, green pepper mixture, sausage slices, peas, beans,
mussels and shrimp on top of rice. Bring back quickly to a boil and
simmer on top of the stove or bake in a pre-heated 350~ oven for
20-25 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed and the mussels have
opened. Let the paella stand in a warm place for 5 minutes for the
flavors to blend; adjust seasoning and serve immediately. (wrv)
