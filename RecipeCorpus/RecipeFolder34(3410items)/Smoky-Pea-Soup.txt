Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1    Inch fresh ginger root --
Peeled & crushed
4    Sprigs fresh dill
2    Sprigs parsley
1 ts Ground allspice
1/8 ts Black pepper
Salt
2 tb Fresh dill -- chopped
1    Ham hocks
2 tb Olive oil
2 c  Onion -- chopped
3 sm Carrots -- chopped
2 tb Garlic -- minced
1 lb Split peas -- rinsed and
Drained
12 c  Chicken broth
Place the ham hock in a medium size saucepan and cover with cold
water. Bring to a boil and continue to gently boil for 15 minutes.
Drain and rinse under cold water.  Pat dry.  Heat the oil in a heavy
soup pot over low heat.  Add the onions and carrots and cook,
stirring, until the onions are wilted, about 10 minutes.  Add the
garlic and cook 1 minute longer. Add the ham hock, peas, chicken
broth, ginger, dill and parsley, allspice and pepper.  Bring to a
boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer; partially covered, for 1
1/4 hours, stirring constantly.  Remove the ham hock and cool
slightly.  Shred the meat from the bone and return it to the soup.
Remove the ginger and dill and parsley sprigs and discard.  Adjust
the seasonings, adding salt if needed, and serve piping hot,
garnished with the chopped dill.
