Title: Fruit Salad Rice
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  White rice
2 1/2 c  Fruit salad juice; from can
Cook over low heat until the rice is soft and fluffy. You may want to
add a little more sugar to the juice. This sweet dessert rice goes
well with the fruit salad itself, and may also be served with whipped
cream.

Variation: pour 1 cup prepared fruit rice to a small dish.  Prepare 2
cups red jello, and add to the dish while hot. Some of the jello will
soak into the rice layer, and some of it will form a second layer.
Cool and refrigerate. To serve, cut to slices (like a cake).
