Title: Heartsease Tea
Categories: Beverages, Herbs/spice, Companion
Yield: 1 batch
1/4 c  Dried unsprayed rose petals
1/4 c  Dried violas
-- (Johnny-jump-ups,
-- pansies, or violets)
1 c  Rose hips
1/2 c  Diced dried pitted cherries
1/4 c  Crumbled dried orange peel

The naturally tart taste of this tea may be amended by adding honey or
other sweetener (rose geranium sugar is especially nice).

Mix all the ingredients.  Store in a glass jar with a tight-fitting
lid. Use about a tablespoon per cup and steep for 15 minutes to
release the flavor of rose hips and cherries.
