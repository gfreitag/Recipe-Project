A vegetable flour centerpiece or garnish is never complete without the
accent of greenery.  The green foilage around, or in a vegetable flour
arrangement adds depth to color, authenticity to design and interest
to the arrangement. The most common greenery used when garnishing is
parsley which is available in the markets throughout most of the
year.  Parsley is an deal foliage to use when creating garnishes
which will lay flat around a meat entre or in the center of a relish
tray. If you are making a high vegetable flower centerpiece then
greenery which will stand and act as a filler is needed. here is
where the cucumber leaves come in handy. These leaves are easy to
make and add another dimension to the arrangements.

1. To make the leaves, slice off the skin of the cucumber in a long
strip.

2. Us the point of the knife and notch out the leaf into a leaf shape.

3. After the leaf has been notched out all around, use the point of
the knife blade and 'draw' the weins of the leaf.  Place in ice water
until ready to use. When using the cucumber leaves in an arrangement
place long toothpicks into the container to be used and secure the
cucumber leaf on the toothpick. Other greenery which works well in
high flower arrangements are:

Fresh Dill Scallion Tops
Asparagus
Endive
Kale Greens
Carrot Tops
