Categories: Side dish, Microwave, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Grated horseradish
Salt and pepper
1 tb Chopped mixed fresh herbs
4 lg Onions
3 tb Cream cheese
1 ea Egg
Peel the onions and cut the tops off.  Take a little off the base as
well, if they do not stand firmly.  Arrange in a circle in a small
dish. Add 1/3 cup water.  Cover and microwave on HIGH for 10 minutes.
Leave the onions to cool, then drain and scoop out the insides with a
small spoon, being sure to leave at least two layers of skin so they
retain their shape.
Puree the scooped out pulp in a food processor, adding the cream
cheese, egg, grated horseradish, salt and pepper.
Put the onion shells back in the dish.  Fill with the puree, put in
the dish in the microwave and cook for 4 minutes on HIGH.
Sprinkle the onions with the chopped herbs and serve hot.
