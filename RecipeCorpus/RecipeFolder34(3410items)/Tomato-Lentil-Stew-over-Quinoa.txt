Recipe by: tara@starburst.umd.edu (Tara McDermott) In a medium-large
saucepan boil lentils in water for about 30 - 40 minutes

(or until thoroughly cooked).  While these are cooking, chop onions
and tomatoes.  In a very large skillet or pan, sautee onions until
they are just about cooked (mostly translucent).  Add tomatoes and
stir occasionally.  Crush the marjoram and savory in your palm and
rub together

to release the flavor, and add to the pan.  Add the salt.  When it
seems the tomatoes are fairly stewy and cooked, add the cooked, well
drained lentils (which by this time should be done).  Cook together
for a few minutes to get an even mixture. To cook quinoa, boil two
parts water to one part quinoa.  Add grain (supposedly you're
supposed to rinse it, but I

don't have a fine enough colander, so I do without this step).  Cover
and lower to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes.  Stir and let sit covered
off the heat for ten minutes before serving. This is a really good
dish with steamed cauliflower and for a really neat touch, try adding
some cooked arame seaweed on top.  Soak a handful of arame in cold
water (you don't need very much of this - a little goes a LONG way,
and it's very very dense in nutrition).  In a small pan heat some oil
and add a couple cloves

of chopped or pressed garlic, and a very small amount of diced ginger
(optional).  Add drained and squeezed arame and sautee for a few
minutes.

Add soy sauce to taste.  When the arame becomes crispy it's ready to
eat. Just sprinkle on top of the stew, or any pasta dish for that
matter.
