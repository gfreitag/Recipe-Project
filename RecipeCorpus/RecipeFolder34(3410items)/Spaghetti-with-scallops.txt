1 lb Fresh spaghetti
Salted water
2 tb Butter, melted

Halve the scallops horizontally and marinate for 30 minutes in a
mixture of the lemon juice, sherry, Marsala, and the ground pepper.

Melt the butter in a skillet, gently saute the scallions and garlic
until they are transparent. Add the scallops and marinade, and simmer
on a low heat until cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Remove scallops from the pan and stir in the saffron and cream, bring

scallops to the skillet, add the chervil and peppercorns; cover and
let rest to blend the ingredients.

Cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water until al dente, then rinse
and drain.  Mix the spagetti with the melted butter in a bowl. Divide
the spagetti among 4 plates, top with the scallops and sauce. Serve
with freshly ground pepper and garnish with chervil leaves.
