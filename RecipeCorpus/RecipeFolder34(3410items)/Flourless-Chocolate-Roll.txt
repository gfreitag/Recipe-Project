Categories: Newspaper, Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 roll
Chocolate-dipped strawberrys
. Creme Anglaise or pureed
. raspberry sauce for
. garnish  (optional)
1/2 lb Dark sweet chocolate;
.  (preferably Valrhona)
8 lg Eggs; separated
1 c  Sugar
Unsweetened cocoa powder
MMMMM-----------------------CREME FILLING----------------------------
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Powdered sugar
Oil an 18x12x1-inch jellyroll pan.  Cover with wax paper and let the
paper extend over the sides.  Do not oil the paper.

Melt the chocolate in a pan over hot water (or melt slowly in a
microwave at 50% power); remove the pan from the water and let cool.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar.  In a separate,
clean bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until light peaks
form. Fold the chocolate into the egg yolk mixture; gently fold in
the egg whites.  Spread the batter evenly in the pan and bake at
350Ã¸F for 17 minutes.

Remove from the oven.  Place two cold, damp dishcloths on top of the
cake (this prevents the cake from drying out as it cools).  Over
these, place 1 dry dishcloth to absorb some of the moisture.

When cool, remove the dishcloths, loosen the cake roll at the edges,
turn over and peel off the paper.  Spread the cream filling over the
cake. Roll up gently from one long side; dust with cocoa.  Transfer
to a serving platter with a wide spatula(s), and slice.  Serve
garnished with Creme Anglaise, chocolate-dipped strawberries and/or
pureed raspberry sauce.

**  Creme Filling  ** While preparing the cake, chill the cream, bowl
and beaters.

As the cake bakes, beat the cream until it peaks; sprinkle in the
sugar and beat.  Add the vanilla and beat until stiff.  Use as
directed.
