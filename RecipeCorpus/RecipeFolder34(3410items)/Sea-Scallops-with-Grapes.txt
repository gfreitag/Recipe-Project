Title: Sea Scallops with Grapes
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
-removed from stem
1/2 lb Green seedless grapes
-removed from stem
2 tb Cold butter, cut in pieces
2 tb Flat-leaf parsley
1/2 c  Slivered almonds
2 tb Olive oil
1 lb (to 1 1/2 lb) sea scallops
1 c  Dry white wine
1/2 lb Red seedless grapes
Preheat oven to 350F.

Scatter the almonds on a cookie sheet or cake tin and toast in the
oven until evenly browned, shaking the pan occasionally, about 10
minutes. Set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When
the oil begins to smoke, add the sea scallops, shaking the pan to
prevent them from sticking. Cook to brown nicely, about 2 minutes.
Turn scallops over and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove scallops to a
bowl and set aside.

Add the wine to the skillet, stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape
up any residue left by the scallops. Increase heat to high, bring to
a boil, and reduce the liquid by half, about 2 minutes. Add the
almonds and grapes, cooking for 1 minute longer. Add the butter and
parsley and stir so that the butter melts gently. Remove from the
heat and add the scallops and any accumulated liquid, tossing to
coat. Spoon onto individual plates and serve.
