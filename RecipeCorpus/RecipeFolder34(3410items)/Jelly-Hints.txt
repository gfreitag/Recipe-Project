~ You will need a large kettle with a broad flat bottom.  This will
allow the sugar and juice mixture to mix quickly and evenly.  You
will also need a long handled spoon for skimming the jelly, a pair of
tongs for removing the glasses from the hot water and a small pan for
heating the paraffin.

~ Before Storing, let jellied fruit products stand at least 8 hours to
avoid breaking the gel.  Cover with metal or paper lids. Store in a
cool, dry place.  The shorter the storage time, the better the
eating. - Preventing skin on sauce and jellies.  Spread a thin layer
of melted butter or cream over jellies, puddings, and other sauces
right after cooking. Stir and all the skin and foam will dissapear.
