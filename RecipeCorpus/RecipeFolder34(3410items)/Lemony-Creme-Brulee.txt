Title: Lemony Creme Brulee
Categories: Desserts, French
Yield: 6 servings
2/3 c  Milk
Grated rind of 1 lemon
6 tb Brown sugar
6    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Sugar
2 c  Heavy cream
Heat heavy cream and lemon rind until almost boiling. Strain. Cream
yolks with sugar until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour
hot cream into yolk/sugar mix, stirring gently.  Pour mixture into
ungreased oven proof custard cups. Bake in a bain marie at 350 F (150
C) for about 50 minutes, until custard is set. Remove from oven, cool
to room temperature and refrigerate overnight, covered.

Traditional serving suggestion: place cooled custard cups on a baking
sheet.  Sprinkle brown sugar evenly but sparingly over the surface of
the custards. Place under a very hot broiler until the sugar just
melts, about 1 minute. Wait another 1 minute and serve. The sugar
should be warm and crispy, and the custard cool and smooth.

Note: I think this custard is better served cold, without the melted
brown sugar on top of it.
