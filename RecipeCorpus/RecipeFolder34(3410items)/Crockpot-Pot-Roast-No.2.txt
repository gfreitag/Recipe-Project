Categories: Meats, Crockpot
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
-of fat
1 lb Fresh mushrooms, cleaned
And sliced
1 c  Cheap Burgundy wine
1 ea Onion, peeled and quartered
1 lb Carrots, peeled, sliced

And cut into 2-3" pieces
One beef pot roast, trimmed
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Place items in crockpot in this order: onions, carrots, beef roast,
mushrooms. Pour wine over all. Cook 6-8 hours (I have an autoshift
pot, which cooks at a higher temperature for the first 2 hours; so I
usually only cook the roast for 6 hours or so). If desired, peeled,
quartered potatoes may be added to the top of the pot about an hour
before the roast is finished.
