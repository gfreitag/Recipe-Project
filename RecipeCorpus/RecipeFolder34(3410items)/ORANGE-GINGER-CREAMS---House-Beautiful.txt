Grated zest of 1 large lemon
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 1/4 ts Ground ginger
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Grated whole nutmeg

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
Grated zest of 2 large
-oranges
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter,
-slightly softened
2 c  Confectioners' sugar
In a medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda,
ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside.

In a large bowl cream together butter, 3/4 C granulated sugar and
brown sugar until fluffy. Add egg yolks, molasses, orange zest and
lemon zest, and beat until smooth. Gradually beat in dry ingredients.

To form cookies, roll bits of dough into 1-inch balls. Place balls
about 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Lightly grease the
bottom of a drinking glass and lightly dip the bottom in the
remaining 2 T granulated sugar. Use glass to flatten dough balls
until they are about 1/4 inch thick and 1 3/4 inches in diameter.
Continue dipping the glass in the granulated sugar after each cookie
to prevent dough from sticking to the glass.

Bake in the upper third of a preheated 375'F oven 8 to 10 minutes, or
until cookies are slightly darker around the edges. Remove from oven
and let stand 30 seconds. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
(Cool baking sheets completely between batches.)

Make filling: In a medium bowl beat together the butter,
confectioners' sugar and orange zest until fluffy.

Assemble cookies: Spread a heaping teaspoon of filling over the flat
side of half the cookies. Gently press remaining cookies over the
filling. Store in an air-tight container and refrigerate up to 4 days
or freeze up to 1 month. Makes about 3 dozen 2 1/2-inch sandwich
cookies.
