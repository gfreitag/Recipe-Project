Title: Teriyaki Spiced Pork Chops
Categories: Newspaper, Bbq/grill, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 ts Ginger; minced
8    Pork chops; thin cut
1/3 c  Teriyaki marinade & sauce
1 tb White wine vinegar
Combine the teriyaki marinade & sauce with the vinegar and ginger,
and pour over the chops in a large shallow glass, ceramic or
stainless steel baking pan.  Turn the chops over to coat both sides
well. Cover and refrigerate at least 45 minutes, turning over
occasionally.

Reserving the marinade, remove the chops and place on a grill 4 to 5
inches from the medium-hot coals.  Cook 6 to 8 minutes, or until the
pork is still slightly pink in the center, turning the chops over and
brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade.  (Or, broil the
chops 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pork is still slightly pink in
the center, turning over and brushing occasionally with the reserved
marinade.)
