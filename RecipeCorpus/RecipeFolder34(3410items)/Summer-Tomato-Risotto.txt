Title: Summer Tomato Risotto
Categories: Side dish, Tomatoes, Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Honey
1 1/4 c  Arborio rice
6 c  Chicken broth
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Mint leaves -- chopped
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Onion -- coarsely chopped
2 tb Garlic -- minced
4 lg Beefsteak tomatoes -- peeled
And chopped
Heat the oil in a heavy pot over low heat.  Add the onion and cook to
wilt slightly, 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and
cook 4 minutes longer.  Add the tomatoes and honey, increase the heat
to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the mixture
has thickened, 20 minutes.  When the tomatoes are nearly done
cooking, bring the chicken broth to a boil in a medium size pan.
Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Add the rice and stir well,
making sure that all the grains are evenly coated with the tomato
mixture.  Add 1/2 cup of the hot broth and cook, stirring frequently,
until it has been absorbed into the rice, 3 to 4 minutes. Continue to
cook, stir, and add broth 1/2 cup at a time until all has been
absorbed. Remove from heat and add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in
the mint and serve.
