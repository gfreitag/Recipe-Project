Title: Cream Spinach Bake^
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 pk (.25oz) onion soup mix
1 sl Bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/3 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
2 pk (10oz) frozen chopped
Spinach, thawed and well
Drained
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
Combine spinach, sour cream, onion soup mix and bacon. Spoon into a
lightly greased 1-qt. casserole. Sprinkle with cheese.

Bake at 350F. 30 minutes.

Notes:

This casserole isn't as creamy if there's excess moisture in the
spinach. To drain thawed spinach, gently press between layers of
paper towels until all liquid is removed.

To freeze, assemble and place unbaked casserole in an airtight
container; freeze up to 3 months. Microwave on high until thoroughly
heated, stirring once.
