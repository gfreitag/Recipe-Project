Title: PIZZA DOUGH ROUNDS - Bon Appetit
Categories: Bon appetit, Breads, Pizza
Yield: 4 crusts
2 1/3 c  (or more) unbleached all
-purpose flour
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
3/4 tb Salt
1    Envelope dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
3/4 c  Plus 1 T (or more) warm
-water (I05'F to 115'F)
Sprinkle yeast and sugar over 1/4 C plus 1 T warm water in medium
bowl; stir to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Steel Knife: Combine 2 1/3 C flour, oil and salt in work bowl. With
ma- chine running, pour yeast mixture through feed tube and process
until dough cleans sides of work bowl, about 15 seconds. If dough
sticks to bowl, add more flour through feed tube 1 tablespoon at a
time, incorporating each addition before adding next. If dough is too
dry, add more water through feed tube 1 T at a time, incorporating
each addition before adding next. Process until smooth and elastic.

Transfer dough to large plastic bag. Twist bag to release air and
seal at top, leaving space for dough to expand. Let dough rise in
warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Punch down and refrigerate in bag.)

Divide dough into 4 equal portions; form each into ball. Roll each
out on lightly floured surface to 8-inch round. (Can be prepared 6
hours ahead. Place between oiled foil sheets and chill.)

Makes four 8-inch pizza crusts
