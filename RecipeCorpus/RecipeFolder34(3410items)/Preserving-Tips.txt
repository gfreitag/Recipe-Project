~ Soft pickles are caused by using brine or vinegar which is too
weak, not keeping pickles covered with liquid, not keeping scum
removed from top of brine, not heating enough to destroy organisms of
spoilage, or not sealing jars airtight while boiling hot. - Shriveled
pickles are caused by adding too much salt, sugar or vinegar at once
time. - Cider vinegar is not necessary for making pickles and
relishes. In fact, some expert home canners prefer to use white
distilled vinegar. The important thing is to use a high grade
product. - If neither fresh nor dried dill is available, dill seed
may be used in making pickles. 2 or 3 tbsp of dill seed is needed for
each quart of pickles. - Pickles are likely to spoil unless heated
until amost boiling hot at the center, packed into jars, covered with
boiling hot liquid and sealed at once or packed cold, covered with
boiling liquid and processed 15 minutes in a boiling water bath. The
processing time is for pints and quarts. Half gallons require 25
minutes. The short cooking will not soften pickles. Origin: Cooking
