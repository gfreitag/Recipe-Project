Title: Amish Apple Dumplings
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
Sugar sauce:
2 c  Water
3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
2 tb Butter
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Mace
6    Apples, peeled and cored
Lemon juice
1/2 c  White sugar, approx
1 ts Cinnamon
Brown sugar
Butter
2    Pie pastry for 2 pies
Roll out pastry and cut into squares enough  to cover apples
completely. Peel and core apples.  Roll in lemon juice.  Then roll in
white sugar and cinnamon combined.  Place on pastry square.  Stuff
core cavity with brown sugar, butter, brown sugar in equal parts.
(The amount depends on size of core cavity, just stuff full.)  Fold
pastry up around apple to completely enclose it.  Place in pan.
Prepare sugar sauce by mixing water, sugar, vanilla, butter, nutmeg,
and mace and boiling for 1 minute. Let cool slightly.  Pour over
Apples. Bake in 375 F oven for 1 hour. Serve warm. Note:  Apples may
be frozen in pastry (before sugar sauce is added) if desired.  Good
dessert to make ahead if you have lots of apples around. Just let
thaw when ready to use, and cover with sugar sauce and bake as usual.
