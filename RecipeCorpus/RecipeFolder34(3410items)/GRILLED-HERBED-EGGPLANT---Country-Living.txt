Categories: Country liv, Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
3    Cloves garlic, finely
-chopped
2 tb Finely chopped fresh or
2 ts Dried oregano leaves
2 ts Lemon juice
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
1    8-inch-long (14-oz) eggplant
Or 4 5-inch-long baby
-eggplants
1 ts Salt
3 tb Olive oil
1 tb Butter
1. Heat outdoor charcoal grill until hot. Meanwhile, cut stem end off
large eggplant. Cut unpeeled eggplant lengthwise into 8 wedges. If
using baby eggplants, leave stems attached and cut 1/4-inch-thick
slices from bottom almost to stem end.

2. Place eggplant wedges or baby eggplants in large colander over
bowl. Lightly sprinkle cut surfaces with salt. Let stand until beads
of moisture appear on eggplant surface-about 30 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, in small saucepan, heat oil and butter over low heat
until butter melts. Add garlic and cook until golden, about 30
seconds. Remove from heat. Add oregano, lemon juice, and pepper.

4. Rinse eggplant under cold water; pat dry with paper towels. Arrange
eggplant wedges on plate or tray; brush cut surfaces with some oil
mixture. If using baby eggplants, flatten slices and spread them out
like fans, brushing some oil mixture between slices.

5. Place eggplant, cut side down, on lightly greased grill 4 to 6
inches from medium-hot coals. Grill, turning often and brushing with
remaining oil mixture several times, until tender and browned 6 to 8
minutes for wedges, 8 to 10 minutes for baby eggplant slices.
