Title: Sweet and Sour Black Bear
Categories: Game
Yield: 1 text file  Bear meat isn't as common in the average household as other big game
but, if the bear is young and tender and hadn't learned to catch fish
it should taste good enough for anybody. Be sure that bear meat is
thoroughly cooked to avoid trichinosis.

Cube about 2 lbs. of bear meat and sprinkle with salt and pepper, then
dredge with flour.  Brown in a little shortening.  After the bear
pieces are browned, add 1/2 c. water, 1/4 c. wine vinegar and 2 T.
soy sauce. Cover and simmer for an hour or until fork tender.  Now
add 1 c. apricot jam and 1 green pepper, diced, and cook 20 min.
longer. Serve over rice.
