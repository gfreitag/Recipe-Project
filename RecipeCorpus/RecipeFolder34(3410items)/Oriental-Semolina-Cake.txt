Preheat oven to 170 C (325 F).

In a large bowl combine semolina, sugar, baking powder, sour cream and
margarine.  Gradually add water.  Beat until smooth (a little more
water may be needed).

Oil a large oven pan.  Spread the pan with tahini.

Pour the batter into the pan, sprinkle with peanuts or pine nuts, and
bake 45 minutes, or until golden.  Cool.

Make syrup: combine sugar, water and lemon juice in a large,
heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Cook on low heat for 20 minutes, until
thick.

Cut the cake to 5 cm X 5 cm (2 inch X 2 inch) squares, and pour the
hot syrup over the cake squares.

Serve immediately or at room temperature.

Origin: The recipe for this traditional middle-eastern cake was found
at the back of an Israeli wheat semolina brand.
