Title: Making Croutons
Categories: Salads, Breads
Yield: 1 batch
1    Recipe
Trim the crusts from leftover slices of bread.  I freeze left over
heels from my ABM bread, so this is a way of using up the less
marvelous breads I make. (leave some crust on, if you are adventurous
) Any kind/or mix of breads, but sweet breads aren't so hot.  Spead
the slices with butter or margerine (melting the stuff first and
brushing it on works nice), and cut into 1/2 inch cubes.

Put the cubes on a rimmed baking sheet, and sprinkle them with garlic
powder and Italian seasoning.   Bake in a 350 F oven for 25-30
minutes. Turn 'em and stir 'em once or twice.  Store in a covered
container, in the 'fridge.

Yes, I <have>> done this, all you non-believers.  The above is my
wording of what I learned in Bread Machine Magic, by Linda Rehberg
and Lois Conway.

Variations from Bread Machine Magic:

1.    Use dried dill instead of Italian seasoning. 2. Sprinkle with
Parmesan Cheese before baking. 3. Leave out butter and garlic powder:
Put a littel minced garlic in some olive oil and drizzle it
:
(love
that word) on before baking. 4. You can also melt some
:
butter/oleo in a skillet, add seasonings and
cubes, and saute to a golden brown (instead of using an oven.)
But it uses a lot more butter.
