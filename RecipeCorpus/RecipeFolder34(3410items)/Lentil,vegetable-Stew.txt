3    Carrots; sliced

1 ts Thyme leaves
1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
3 tb Parsley, chopped
4 c  Water; or stock

28 oz Tomatoes, canned; chopped

In 6-qt Dutch oven or soup kettle, combine first 15 ingredients.
Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice and
lentils are tender, 45-60 minutes. Add additional water or tomato
juice if necessary.

Stir in remaining ingredients, cover and continue to cook until
vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.

Sylvia's comments: this was a good, hearty stew.  However, I couldn't
fit all the ingredients for 12 servings in my Dutch oven; next time
I'll cut it in half.  Because it was so overfull, I couldn't stir
thoroughly and it burned on the bottom.  I also had to keep adding
water. I used more vegetables, including cauliflower.  I also didn't
like the way the dried herbs stand out in the final result; next time
I'll use fresh herbs.
