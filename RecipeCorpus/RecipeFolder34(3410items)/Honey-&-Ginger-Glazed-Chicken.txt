Title: Honey & Ginger-Glazed Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
Scallion, for garnish
3 lb Chicken pieces
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 tb Garlic -- minced
1 tb Ginger root -- minced
1 tb Cilantro -- chopped
1 c  Honey
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Lemon juice
For the marinade, combine the ingredients in a bowl large enough to
hold the chicken pieces.  Rinse the chicken well, removing any excess
fat, and pat dry.  Add to the marinade and toss well to coat.  Cover
and let rest at room temperature for 2 hours, turning the pieces once
or twice. Preheat the oven to 350.  Place the chicken pieces in a
shallow baking dish large enough to hold it in a single layer and
drizzle with 1 cup of the marinade. Bake, basting with the pan juices
every 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through, about 45
minutes.  Remove the chicken to a serving platter and cover to keep
warm.  Reduce the cooking juices on the stove over medium heat until
slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.  Spoon a bit of sauce over the
chicken and sprinkle with scallions.  Serve the remaining sauce
alongside.
