1/4 ts Salt
1 ts To 3 t Scotch whisky
Fresh dill sprigs (opt.)
Lemon slices (opt.)
Salmon Dumplings (recipe
-follows)
1 lb Sea scallops
2 tb All-purpose flour
4 tb Butter
2 tb Lemon juice
1. Prepare Salmon Dumplings.

2. If scallops are large, cut in half. Remove gristle from side of
each scallop, if present. Dry scallops thoroughly; toss with flour.
In large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons butter. Saute scallops just
until they are lightly browned.

3. Add lemon juice to skillet and cook over low heat, stirring until
liquid thickens slightly. Add Salmon Dumplings, remaining 2 T butter,
the parsley, and salt; cook just until dumplings are heated through.
Drizzle with desired amount of Scotch. Remove from heat; spoon
scallop mixture into scallop shells or onto serving plates. Garnish
with dill sprigs and lemon slices if desired; serve immediately.

Salmon Dumplings: In food processor with chopping blade, process 3 oz
sliced smoked salmon, 1/2 lb cutup scallops, 1 large egg white, 1
tablespoon chopped fresh dill, 1 t lemon juice, 1/4 t ground white
pepper, and 1/8 t  salt until smooth (do not over process). Add 1/3 C
heavy cream through the feed tube with motor running; process just
until combined. Fill a 2-quart saucepan three quarters full of water.
Heat water to boiling over high heat; reduce heat to medium so water
simmers. Fill pastry bag, fitted with 1/2-inch-round tip, with salmon
mixture. Gently squeeze pastry bag over simmering water and cut off
1/2-inch pieces into the water. Cook dumplings 2 minutes. With
slotted spoon, remove dumplings from water to tray or bowl; cover and
refrigerate until ready to use.
