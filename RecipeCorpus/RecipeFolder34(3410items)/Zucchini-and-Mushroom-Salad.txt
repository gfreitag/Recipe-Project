Title: Zucchini and Mushroom Salad
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
2    Fresh tarragon
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1 lb Button mushrooms
8 sm Zucchini
1/4 c  Wine vinegar
2 tb Olive oil
Clean the mushrooms.  Cut the zucchini into 1 inch lengths.  Place all
ingredients in a pot.  Simmer until the zucchini is just tender.
Turn off

heat.  Place lid on pot and leave for 15 minutes. Place the drained
vegetables in a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid.  Place this
liquid back in the pot and cook until reduced to about 1/3 cup.
Discard the tarragon. Pour over the vegetables and lightly chill
(don't over-chill or

it will kill the flavor). Throw on a little finely chopped parsley
before serving.
