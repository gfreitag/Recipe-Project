1. Preheat oven to 425 F.

2. Heat 2 Tbs of the oil in a heavy flameproof baking dish over low
heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the vegetables,
season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with the remaining 1 Tbs
oil. Roast in the oven for 30 to 35 mins, or until the vegetables are
tender and nicely browned; turn them often during roasting.

3. While the vegetables are roasting, melt the butter in a 4-qt
casserole over low heat. Whisk in the stock or bouillon, season with
salt and pepper, and simmer for 15 mins.

4. Puree the vegetables in a food processor. Whisk in the flour and
cook for 1 min. Whisk the puree into the broth and simmer for 10
mins. Add the heavy cream and just heat through. Correct the
seasoning and serve hot.

NOTE: A great soup to use up leftover roasted vegetables. Also,
roasting veggies this way, makes for a wonderful starter salad topped
with thinly sliced red onion and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette.
