chars-about 5 minutes. Transfer pepper halves to plastic bag; let

2. Rinse or wipe mushrooms clean with damp paper towels. Discard
stems from shiitake mushrooms. Place mushrooms in small bowl. For the
salad dressing, in jar with tight-fitting lid, combine oil, vinegar,
mustard, sugar, Worcestershire, thyme, and salt. Shake until well

remaining dressing.

3. Place mushrooms in single layer on broiler pan. Broil about 4
inches from heat source for 1 minute; turn mushrooms. Broil 1 minute
longer or just until cooked through. Set aside to cool.

4. With vegetable peeler, shave cheese into thin slices. Peel skin off
pepper halves. Cut pepper into strips. Rinse greens and spin dry. In
large bowl, toss mixed greens with cheese, pepper strips, mushrooms,
and remaining salad dressing. Spoon onto serving plates. Garnish with
pea pods and asparagus, if desired.
