This is a persian dish that in it's original form uses lamb.  I have
omitted this part for obvious reasons.  :)

1 lb eggplant 1 cup yogurt 3 tbs sesame oil 2 cloves garlic 1/4 tsp
coriander 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp cumin 1 tsp cinnamon

Cut eggplant into thick slices, approximately 1/2" thick, put in
boiling salted water for 7 minutes.  Remove and let stand 1 hour Fry
eggplant in sesame oil until cooked, peel, mash, add salt and
corriander. Crush garlic, add to yogurt, mix with eggplant. sprinkle
with cumin and cinnamon and serve.
