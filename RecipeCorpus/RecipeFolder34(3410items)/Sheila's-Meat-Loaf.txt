Title: Sheila's Meat Loaf
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Bottled Chili Sauce
12 ea Saltine Crackers - crushed
1 tb Minced dry onion
1/2 c  Grated Carrot
2 lb Lean Ground Beef
1/2 lb Bulk Pork Sausage
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Milk
Lightly but thoroughly mix all ingredients together.  Press into a
lightly oiled loaf pan.  Bake at 350 F for 90 minutes.

Another one I cook in the microwave but instead of a loaf pan I use a
round glass cake pan with a custard cup set upside down in the
middle, and the meat mixture pressed around the cup.  This takes
about 10 minutes cooking on high, turning every three min.

I use canned gravy if I'm lazy, otherwise make a gravy with beef
stock.
