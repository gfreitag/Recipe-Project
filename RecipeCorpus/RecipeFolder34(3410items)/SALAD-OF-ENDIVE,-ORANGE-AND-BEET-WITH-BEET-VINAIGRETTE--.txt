Prepare vinaigrette: In a large pot of water, add beet and bring to a
boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook covered,
until beet is tender, about 45 minutes. Drain. When beet is cool
enough to handle, peel, trim and cut into quarters.

Place beet in a food processor and process until pureed. The puree
will be chunky.

Place a strainer over a bowl, pour in beet puree and press with a
spoon to extract juice. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 table-
spoons beet juice with the mustard. Slowly whisk in olive oil and
season to taste.

Prepare salad: Thinly slice beet halves into the shape of half moons.
Cut endive in half lengthwise, and thinly slice horizontally.

Arrange equal amounts of beet slices and orange sections on 4 plates.
Mound endive in the center and drizzle a generous amount of beet
vinaigrette around the edge of each plate. Garnish with parsley and
chervil leaves. Serves 4.
