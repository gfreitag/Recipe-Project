As you serve salad, divide cheese and beets evenly among each portion.

DRESSING:  In blender or food processor combine salad oil, red wine
vinegar, olive oil, salt, mustard, pepper and chives.  Whirl or
process until smoothly blended.  If dressing is made ahead, shake
well before using.  Makes about 1/2 cup.

TIPS: You can substitute thinly sliced green onions, using a good
portion of the green tops for fresh chives.  Add a tablespoon fresh
chopped parsley to enhance the color.  This salad makes a good use of
canned beets. To make a warm weather main dish salad, mix in strip of
cold chicken or turkey breast.
