Categories: Newspaper, Tex/mexican, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Dried basil
1 1/2 ts Dried oregano
Cayenne pepper to taste
Black pepper to taste
1 1/2 c  Monterey Jack cheese
12    Corn tortillas; softened
.   (see note below)
2 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Onion; minced
6 cl Garlic; minced
3/4 ts Salt
1 lg Bell pepper; minced
5    Zucchini; (6" long) minced
1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
MMMMM-------------------------RED SAUCE------------------------------
5 cl Garlic; minced
1/2 ts Red pepper; crushed
1/2 ts Ground cumin
5 md Tomatoes; diced
1 lg Red bell pepper; minced
1 ts Salt
Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet.  Add the onions, garlic and
salt; then saute over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the
onion is quite soft.  Add the bell pepper, zucchini, cumin, basil,
oregano, cayenne and black pepper.  Stir and cook over medium heat
for 3 to 8 minutes, or until the zucchini is just tender.

Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese.  Let cool a few minutes
before filling the tortillas.

Assemble the enchiladas by placing a few tablespoons filling on one
side of each tortilla and rolling up.

Pour a small amount of red sauce in a shallow baking dish, add the
rolled enchiladas and pour the remaining sauce over the top.  Cover
with foil and bake about 30 minutes in a 325Ã¸F oven.  Serve hot.

NOTE:  To soften tortillas; moisten in one of these ways:  Saute
briefly in a little hot oil (abouit 10 seconds on each side); dip
briefly in hot sauce; or dip briefly in hot water (the least
desirable, but the easiest). If using frozen tortillas, defrost them
fully wrapped to prevent their drying out.

**  Red Sauce  ** Place the tomatoes, bell pepper, salt, garlic, red
pepper and cumin in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat,
partially cover and simmer about 15 minutes. Leave chunky or puree
smooth in a food processor or blender.  Use as directed.
