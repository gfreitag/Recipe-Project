1. Prepare Filling: In top of double boiler over simmering water,
combine sugar, butter, orange juice, and orange rind. Stir
occasionally until butter melts and sugar dissolves. In small bowl,
beat egg yolks until blended. Stirring constantly, spoon 2 T hot
sugar mixture into yolks. Pour egg-yolk mixture into sugar mixture
and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens to
a pudding consistency-about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Reserve one
T each of chopped pecans and candied cherries; stir remaining pecans,
cherries, and coconut into filling mixture. Cool to room temperature;
cover and refrigerate.

2. Prepare Cake Layers: Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake
pans. Heat oven to 325'F. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat
egg whites until foamy; add 1/4 C granulated sugar and beat until
stiff peaks form. Set aside.

3. In another large bowl, with same beaters, beat together butter and
remaining 1 3/4 C granulated sugar until fluffy. Add vanilla and mix
until blended. In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and
salt. Add to sugar mixture alternately with milk, beginning and
ending with flour. Beat until smooth batter forms.

4. With rubber spatula, gently fold beaten egg whites into batter.
Divide batter among prepared pans. Bake cake layers 30 to 35 minutes
or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cakes in
pans 10 minutes; remove from pans and cool cake completely on wire
rack.

5. To assemble cake; trim tops of cake layers to make level, if
necessary. To make Whipped Cream Frosting, in large bowl, with
electric mixer, beat heavy cream and confectioners' sugar until stiff
peaks form. Place one cake layer on serving plate and spread half of
filling on top. Place next layer on top of filling on first layer;
top with remaining filling. Place last layer on top of filling to
complete 3-layer cake. Frost cake with Whipped Cream Frosting;
garnish top of cake with reserved chopped pecans and candied
cherries. Serve immediately or refrigerate for later.
