Title: Bob Andy Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb All purpose flour
2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla extract
1    Unbaked 9 inch pie shell
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1    Cube brown sugar

Bob Andy Pie is a regional recipe, unlike any I have found elsewhere.
It is a bit like a spicy brown chess pie.  This one is very thick,
rich, and gently quivery.  No one has been able to explain the name

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Set out pie shell.  In a large mixer bowl,
combine the next 6 ingredients.  In another mixer bowl, beat the eggs
well. Add the remaining ingredients.   Blend liquid mixture into
flour mixture, then pour into the unbaked shell.  Bake for 45
minutes. The filling will still be shaky when you remove it from the
oven. The pie puffs up, but levels off as it cools.  Serve at room
temperature.
