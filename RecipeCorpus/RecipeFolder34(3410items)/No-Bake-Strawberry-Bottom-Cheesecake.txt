* Note from Iris:  I have no how to make "strawberry glaze."  No
recipe was given.

Slice strawberries and place on paper towels to drain.  Beat cream
cheese until smooth.  Gradually beat in sugar.  Blend in sour cream
and vanilla. Fold in whipped topping, blending well.  Spread thin
layer of glaze over bottom of crust.  Place strawberry slices on
glaze and cover with another thin layer of glaze.  Gently spoon
mixture over glazed berries in crust. Cover with inverted dome and
chill until set, at least 4 hours. Store leftover pie in refrigerator.

Variation:  For a plain no-bake cheesecake, omit strawberries and
glaze, double the amount of all the other ingredients.

Preparation Time:  15 minutes.  Chilling time:  4+ hours.
