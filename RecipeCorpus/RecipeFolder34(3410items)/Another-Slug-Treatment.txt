Reader Mary Jo Forbus of Arlington, WA wrote: "A few squirts are all
it takes; they die right before your eyes, a very gratifying sight!
The mixture is harmless to soil and plants.  I keep my spray bottle
nearby when gardening and check the garden twice a day, once early in
the morning and again late in the evening."
