Categories: Main dish, Pasta/rice, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Cornstarch, dissolved in
2 ts - Water
4 ts Parmesan cheese, freshly
- grated
1 ts Dried oregano
3 tb Chopped fresh basil
1/8 ts White pepper, ground
1 ts Louisiana-style hot sauce
2 tb Fresh parsley, chopped
8 oz Dried spaghetti
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/4 c  - Water
1/3 c  Shallot, chopped (2 large)
3    Garlic cloves, peeled and
- minced
12    Littleneck clams
10 oz Canned baby clams, broth
- reserved
1 c  Low-fat buttermilk
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, add the
spaghetti, and cook to desired doneness, 6 to 9 minutes.  Drain.

Meanwhile, put the wine, water, shallots, and garlic in a medium
saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Add the fresh clams,
cover, and continue to cook over medium heat.  Remove the clams when
their shells have opened.  Stir the broth from the canned clams into
the saucepan. Cook a few minutes more, until the liquid is reduced by
half.

Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the buttermilk-and-cornstarch
mixture. Cook for about 2 minutes more to thicken, whisking
constantly. Stir in the Parmesan cheese, canned clams, oregano,
basil, pepper, hot sauce, and chopped parsley.

Combine the pasta and the clam sauce in a warm serving bowl and toss
to coat.  Garnish with the cooked clams, in their shells.

A low-fat buttermilk-and-cornstarch mixture is the key to this pasta's
creamy white sauce.  Sweet canned clams provide a pleasing contrast
to the tartness of the buttermilk.  The fresh clams served in thier
shells lend visual excitement to the dish; for added effect, surrand
them with slices of red bell pepper.
