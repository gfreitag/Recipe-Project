This recipe is absolutely sensational.  However it does not make
alot of sauce for rice.  I usually double the sauce ingredients. It
is very hot. If you like food milder leave out some chilis. I have
tried the General Taos chicken posted here on prodigy. My family
prefers this recipe. My last attempt to post this recipe failed.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
