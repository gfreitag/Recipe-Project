Title: Mulberry Compote
Categories: Desserts, British isl, French, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
Sugar; to taste
4 lb Mulberries
Pick out your best mulberries and put them into a bowl. Reduce the
rest - or about 2 lbs of the rest - to juice. this can be done by
liquidizing or processing, and then straining. Or by simmering the
fruit over a low heat until the juices run. or by putting the fruit
into a jug in a low oven, or a bain marie, until they float in their
own juice.
Sweeten the juice to taste, having regard to the ripeness of the
mulberries in the bowl. Stir sugar and juice well together and bring
slowly to the boil. Simmer for 5 minutes, then pour boiling over the
fruit in the bowl. Leave to cool.
Another way is to make the syrup as above, then leave to cool. Put
the fine mulberries into it and bring to the boil, allow it one good
bubble, and remove from the heat. Leave to cool with a lid on the
pan. Avoid cooking the mulberries in any proper sense of the word -
as Sir Harry Luke says in 'The Tenth Muse', surplus mulberries or any
mulberries that are not quite ripe or that have a hard core are best
turned into water ice for storage and later use.
