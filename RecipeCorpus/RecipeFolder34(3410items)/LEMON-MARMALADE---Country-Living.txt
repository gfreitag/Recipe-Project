1. Using vegetable peeler, remove yellow part of peel in strips from
lemons. Cut strips into 1-by 1/8-inch strips. With knife, cut off all
white membrane, or pith, from peeled lemons.

2. Cut peeled lemons crosswise into 1/4- inch-thick slices. In heavy
nonaluminum 5-quart kettle or Dutch oven, combine lemon peel, sliced
fruit, and water. Cover and refrigerate 3 to 4 hours.

3. Heat lemon mixture to boiling over high heat, stirring frequently.
Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until
lemon mixture is very soft-about 1 hour.

4. Add sugar to lemon mixture and increase heat to medium-high; stir
until sugar dissolves. Heat to boiling and reduce heat just so
mixture boils gently. Boil uncovered, stirring frequently, until
candy thermometer registers 220'F- 45 to 60 minutes.

5. Meanwhile, prepare three 1-pint canning jars with their lids and
bands for processing following manufacturer's directions.

6. Spoon marmalade into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch space at top
ofjars. Wipe jar rims clean. Seal with lids and bands. Process jars in
boiling-water bath 15 minutes. Cool jars on wire rack. Label jars;
store in cool, dry place.

7. For gifts, if desired, decorate each jar with a fabric circle tied
on with ribbon. After opening jar, store marmalade in the
refrigerator.
