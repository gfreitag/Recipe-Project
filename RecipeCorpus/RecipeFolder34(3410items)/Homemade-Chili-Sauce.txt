ends and discard them. Cut the tomatoes into quarters, discarding
seeds. Coarsely chop enough tomatoes to yield 9 cups. 2. Chop green
peppers and onions fine, either in a food mill or by hand. You will
need 1-1/2 cups of each. 3. Mince enough hot pepper to yield 1
tablespoon. 4. Combine cider vinegar, brown sugar and salt (kosher

cinnamon in a cheesecloth square. Add spice bag to vinegar mixture
and stir until sugar is dissolved. 5. Bring mixture to a boil; add
vegetables. Cook rapidly until thick, stirring often to prevent
sticking. When sauce is thick, skim off foam. Immediately fill jars
and seal tightly. Yield: 3 pints.
