Title: Polka Dot Pizzas
Categories: Main dish, Pizza
Yield: 12 servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
2/3 c  Hot water
2 c  Chedder or Mozzarella
Cheese
6    Skinless frankfurters
2 cn (8 oz) tomato sauce
3 tb Instant minced onion
2 ts Organo leaves
1/4 ts Pepper
2 1/2 c  Biscuit baking mix
1. Heat oven to 425 degrees 2. Mix the tomato sauce, minced onion,
organo leaves, and pepperin medium fork. (You'll use this later for a
topping.) 3. Mix biscuit baking mix and the yeast in large bowl with
another fork. Stir in hot water and beat vigorously until the dough
cleans the side of the bowl. 4. Gently smooth the dough into a ball
on the flored board. Knead 20 times. Allow the dough to rest for a
few minutes, then divide the dough into 3 equal parts. 5. Shape 1
part into a ball and place it in the center of ungreased cookie
sheet. Rub a lttle flour on the rolling pin and roll the ball into an
oval 1/4 inch thick. Pinch the edge to make a little stand-up rim. 6.
Dip out 1/3 of the tomato sauce mixture (about 2/3 cup)and pour onto
the oval. Spread the sauce mixture almost to the edge of the dough
with the rubber scraper. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the shredded Chedder
cheese (about 2/3 cup). 7. Cut 2 of the frankfurter crosswise into
penny slices on cutting board. Arrange the slices on the pizza. 8.
Bake in 425 degree oven 15 to 20 minutes or until the crust is goldn
brown. 9. Repeat 5 through 8 for the 2 remaining parts of the dough
and remaining sauce, cheese and frankfurters to make 2 more pizzas.
Note: You may want to gobble up the pizzas as they come out of the
oven. If not, this is a good bake-ahead recipe.  When you're ready to
eat, heat the pizzas, 2 at a time, on an ungreased cookie shee ina
300 degree oven for about 5 minutes or until hot.  The third pizza
will be ready by the time you've finished eating the first 2.
