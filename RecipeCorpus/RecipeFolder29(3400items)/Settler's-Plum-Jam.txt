No Ingredients Found
Take any quantity of the red plums, and put them into a stone jar.
Set this into a pot of water, having first tied a piece of clean
cloth over the top of the jar; bladder is best if you have it at
hand.  Let your fruit-jar remain till the fruit is soft; remove all
the stones that you can find; measure your pulp into a preserving
pan, and to every six pints of fruit add four pounds of good soft
sugar; break some of the stones, and add the kernels to the fruit;
boil all up for nearly an hour, and put by in jars; cover when cold
with papers dipped in white of egg. Origin: The Canadian Settler's
