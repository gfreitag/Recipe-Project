Title: Caesar Salad 2
Categories: Salads
Yield: 1 servings  1. Over torn romaine (3 heads for 6 servings), zig-zag a stream of
olive oil- about 1/3 cup. Repeat with 3 tablespoons vinegar. Squeeze
in 1 lemon.

2. With a flourish, break 1 or 2 coddled eggs (cooked 1 to 1 1/2
minutes) atop salad greens. In Caesar Cardini's words, "Make a
production of it!"

3. Give your pepper mill several generous twists- fresh-ground pepper
makes a snappy difference. Shake in some salt, a splash of
Worcestershire.

4. In goes grated Parmesan cheese. Roll-toss salad. When every leaf
glistens, add a handful of Caesar Croutons; toss again. Anchovy
topper, anyone?
