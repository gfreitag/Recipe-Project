Title: Canneles De Bordeaux
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 ? no idea
1 c  Whole milk
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Rum
Vanilla extract
1 lg Egg
1    Yolk from large egg
1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
These traditional Bordeaux pastries  (CAN-a-lays) are cooked in
conical copper molds with fluted sides, that hold about 3 oz. of
liquid mix. You can use brioche cups, or other small molds.  This
recipe makes a generous quantity.

Mix the egg, yolk and sugar in a large bowl, add the flour and beat
until smooth.  Add 1/4 cup milk.  Heat the other 3/4 cups milk in a
double boiler with the butter to a temp of 185 F.  Add the hot milk
mixture to the egg mixture. Add the rum, and vanilla to taste.  Cover
and let cool at room temperature for two hours, then 12 hours in the
'fridge. The recipe may be prepared ahead to this point.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Lightly grease and flour the molds.  Mix the
chilled liquid and pour it into the molds, place the molds n a cookie
sheet and bake for one hour until dark in color and springy in
texture. Cooking time varies with the shape and size of mold.

Serve warm or at room temperature, on a plate like cookies (but
'Upside Down').   Generally served with Esspreso, but try it with a
sweet Bordeaux, or even a Sauternes (French, and sweet).
