Categories: Cajun/creol, Fish, Mixes
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Sage
-White fish fillets
-Vegetable oil
1 tb Paprika
2 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Cayenne pepper
3/4 ts White pepper
Mix all spices together and store in a tight jar.  Heat 1 tablespoon
vegetable oil in cast iron skillet on medium high heat until very
hot, but not quite smoking.  Rinse fish fillets and pat dry with
paper towel. Rub a little oil on both sides of the fish and sprinkle
spice mix on both sides (generously, if you like it hot). Sear the
fish in the hot oil for about 1 minute.  Flip it and cook the other
side. If the fillets are thick, you may need to lower the heat and
cover to fully cook the fish. Serve with lemon wedges.
