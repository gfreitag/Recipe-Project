Title: Baked Yam Flautas with Pine Nuts and Sesame Seeds
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
6    Corn or flour tortillas
1/2 c  Pine nuts
2 tb Sesame seeds
1 tb Confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
2 lb Yams or winter squash, such
-as acorn, banana, or
-Hubbard; halved, seeded
6 tb Butter; softened
3 tb Dark brown sugar
1.  Heat the oven to 375F.

2.  Place the whole yams or squash pieces on the oven rack and bake
for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, depending on the size, until the pulp is soft
through to the center.  Scrape out the pulp into a bowl.  Add 2
tablespoons of the butter and the sugar; stir with a fork to mix.

3.  Place about 1/3 cup of the yam mixture in the center of a
tortilla. Roll up the tortilla flauta style (rolled up tightly flute
style); secure with a toothpick.

4.  Combine the pine nuts and sesame seeds in an ungreased frying pan.
Toast, stirring, over medium heat until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.

5.  When ready to serve, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large
frying pan set over medium heat until foaming.  Add 3 or 4 flautas
and fry for 1 minute.  Turn and fry on the opposite side until
browned and crisp, about 1 minute more.  Remove to a platter.  Add
the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan and continue with
another round to fry all of the flautas.

6.  Stir the confectioners' sugar into the sour cream.

7.  Top each flauta with the sweetened sour cream.  Sprinkle on the
toasted pine nuts and sesame seeds.  Eat while still warm and crunchy.
