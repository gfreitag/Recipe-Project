Preheat oven to 375 F.

In a large saucepan, steam the broccoli until fork-tender. In a small
saucepan, melt the cheese on low heat, then add the milk, onion, and
bell pepper. Stir until well blended.

Layer the ingredients in a large casserole, beginning with the melted
cheese, then adding the broccoli and sprinkling with the cracker

Dot the crumb layer with butter and repeat. Sprinkle the final layer

uncover the casserole and bake an additional 5 mins, until crumb
topping is lightly browned.
