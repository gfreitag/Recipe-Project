Title: Storing Grains
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 info  There are really two considerations when it comes to storing grains
for any period of time; temperature and space. Whole grains that are
stored under perfect conditions can last an incredibly long time.

There are some simple rules for keeping grains fresh and available. If
space is at a premium, try to buy your grains in small amounts. Then,
store them in one-quart glass jars with tight rubber seals.

Grains should always be stored in a dry, cool place, since the germ
contains an oil that may eventually turn rancid. If you refrigerate
your grains, they'll last for months.
