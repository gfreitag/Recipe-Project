"I love to serve fried chicken with biscuits and honey!"

Remove skin from chicken breast halves.  Place them in a large
container with a cover; pour salted ice water over chicken, covering
completely (use about 2 tsp. salt per quart of ice water).  Cover and
refrigerate overnight.

Up to 2 hours before cooking, drain chicken and pat dry. Place in a
large bowl.  Pour buttermilk over chicken and refrigerate until time
to fry. Drain chicken; dredge the breasts in flour, packing flour
into crevices and coating well.  Deep-fry in hot oil (350 degrees)
for 10 minutes, or until cooked.  Drain in a single layer in a
shallow baking pan.
