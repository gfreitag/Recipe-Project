Title: QUICK BUTTER CROISSANTS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 32 croissants
5 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
4 tb Butter, melted and cooled
1 c  Butter, cut into pieces
1    Egg, beaten with 1 T water
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 c  Warm water (about 110ø)
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Sugar
In a large bowl of an electric mixer, dissolve yeast in water.  Add
milk, salt, sugar, egg, and 1 cup of the flour.  Beat on medium speed
until smooth.  Stir in the 4 tablespoons melted butter; set aside.

Put 4 cups of the remaining flour in another large bowl.  Using a
pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the 1 cup firm butter until
particles are the size of peas.  Pour in yeast batter and fold in
just until flour is evenly moistened.  Cover tightly and refrigerate
at least 4 hours or up to 4 days.

Turn dough out onto a floured board, press into compact ball, and
knead for about 5 minutes.  Divide dough into 4 equal parts.  Shape 1
part at a time, leaving remaining dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, in
refrigerator.

On a floured board, roll 1 part of the dough into a circle 14 inches
in diameter.  Using a sharp knife, cut circle into 8 equal wedges.

For each croissant, loosely roll wedge from base to point.  Shape
each roll into a crescent and place, point down, on an ungreased
baking sheet; keep croissants 1« inches apart all around.  Cover
lightly and let rise at room temperature in a draft-free place.  (Do
not speed rising by placing rolls in a warm spot.)

When almost doubled (about 2 hours), brush with egg mixture.  Bake in
a preheated 325ø oven for about 25 minutes or until lightly browned.
Serve warm.
