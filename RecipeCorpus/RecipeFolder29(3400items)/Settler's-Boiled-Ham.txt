Soak it over night in soft water; wrap a lock of sweet hay about it,
and boil in plenty of water, three, or if very large, four hours; let
the ham remain in the water to cool gradually.  Nex day remove the
skin, and trim all usightly parts away.  The ham will retain its
flavour and juice much better than if skinned hot; this of course can
only be adopted when you do not require to serve the joint up hot to
table; in that case sking it; grate crumbs of bread over the surface,
and let it stand a few minutes in the oven to crisp the bread crumbs.
