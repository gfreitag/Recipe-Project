Now some receipts say "Stir", - some "Whisk"  With rapid motion,
light and brisk  But whether whisk or whether stir  Result is soft as
kitten fur. No man can stay depressed or wroth  While eating
Syllabub's fragrant froth! Fold ingredients together and serve in
parfait glasses lined with sponge cake or lady fingers, or thin with
more wine or cream and serve in punch cups.
