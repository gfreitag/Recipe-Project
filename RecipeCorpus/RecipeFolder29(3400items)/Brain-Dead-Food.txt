Title: Brain-Dead Food: Curry Rice & Spinach
Categories: Fatfree, Curries, Rice, Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
1 cn Diced tomatoes (slightly
Drained)
1    Box Near East Curry Rice
1    Box frozen spinach
1 cn Black beans
I might have posted this before, but one of my favorite brain-dead
foods (outside of spaghetti), is to take one box of Near-East Curry
Rice and cook according to directions, without the added fat.  While
that is cooking, microwave 1 frozen block of spinach (for some reason
fresh spinach doesn't taste as good to me in this recipe -- and takes
longer unless already de-stemmed and washed).  When that is done,
drain and set aside. Nuke 1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed,
and 1 can of diced tomatoes (minus some of the juice), mixed together
(generally for about 3 minutes).

When rice is done, mix spinach, rice, beans and tomatoes (generally
in a large bowl).  Snarf.   Not only does it taste good, but it's
really colorful with the yellow rice, black beans, red tomatoes and
green spinach. Very satisfying.  Even my almost-3-yr-old loves it.

Approximate total time: 25-30 minutes (time to cook rice)
