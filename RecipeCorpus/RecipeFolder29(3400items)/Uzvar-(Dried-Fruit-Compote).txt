Title: Uzvar (Dried Fruit Compote)
Categories: Russian, Holiday
Yield: 10 servings
1    Cinnamon Stick
6    Whole Cloves
2 qt Apple Cider
Juice And Peel Of 1 Lemon
4 oz Dried Prunes, Pitted
4 oz Raisins
8 oz Dried Apple Slices
8 oz Dried Pear Quarters
1 c  Honey, Clover Or Wild
Combine the fruit in a large pot and fill with enough cider to cover
it by a third more.  (The fruit will absorb a lot of liquid.)  Add
the cloves and lemon peel.  Simmer until the larger pieces are cooked
but not falling apart.  Pour off the liquid into a pan and cook until
reduced by 1/3rd.

Add the honey, cinnamon, lemon juice, and fruit.  Reheat, stirring.
Taste, and add more lemon juice if needed.  It should not be cloying
sweet, the taste of the fruit should dominate.

Serve warm in crystal or clear glass bowls.

Keeps in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
