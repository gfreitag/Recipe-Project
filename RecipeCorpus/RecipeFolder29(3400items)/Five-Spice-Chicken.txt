Title: Five-Spice Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Question?
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Five-spice powder
3 lb Chicken
6 c  Steamed long-grain
-white rice
2    Garlic clove(s), minced
1 tb Dry white wine
1 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Oriental sesame oil
1 ts Light brown sugar
1. Preheat oven to 350F. In a small bowl, combine garlic, wine, soy
sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, and five-spice powder. Spoon half of
the marinade into the cavity of the chicken, then set the chicken
breast side up in a medium roasting pan. Rub the remaining marinade
over the chicken.

2. Roast the chicken in the center of the oven for 1 3/4 hours,
basting occasionally with the pan juices. Increase oven temperature
to 500F and continue roasting for about 10 minutes more, or until the
chicken is well browned and the juices run clear when a thigh is
pierced with a fork. Pour the juices from the cavity into the pan,
then transfer the chicken to a platter and let stand for 5 minutes
before carving.

3. Set the roasting pan over 2 burner over high heat. Add 2 tbs water
to the pan and boil for 1 minutes, scraping up any browned bits from
the bottom. Pour the pan juices into a sauceboat and skim the fat.
Carve the chicken and serve with the pan juices and cooked rice.
