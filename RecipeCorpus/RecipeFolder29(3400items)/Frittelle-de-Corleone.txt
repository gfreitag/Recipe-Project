Categories: Desserts, Italian, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 6 servings
2 lg Egg yolks
1/2 c  Milk
Oil, vegetable
Sugar, powdered
1/4 c  Raisins, golden
1/2 c  Marsala OR
1/2 c  Sherry, sweet
1 c  Flour, all purpose
1 pn Salt
Soak the raisins in Marsala for 30 minutes.

Drain the raisins, reserving the wine.  Put the flour and salt
into a mixing bowl.  Stirring very gently with a wooden spoon,
gradually blend in the wine until smooth.  Stir in the egg yolks and
just enough milk to bring the batter to the consistency of a thick
cream sauce.

In a large skillet, heat 1 inch of oil to 375 F. Using about 3
tablespoons for each fritter, spoon batter into the oil; DO NOT
CROWD. Fry the batter until golden, turning once, 4 to 5 minutes.

Drain on paper towels; repeat with remaining batter.  Dust with
powdered sugar and serve hot.
