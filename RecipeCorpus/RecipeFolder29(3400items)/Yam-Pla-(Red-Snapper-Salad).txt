Title: Yam Pla (Red Snapper Salad)
Categories: Seafood, Thai, Salads
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Vegetable oil
1 c  Fresh Thai basil or sweet
-basil leaves, coarsely
-torn or chopped
1    Head leaf lettuce, leaves
-separated, washed & dried
1 1/2 lb Red snapper fillets
6 tb Nam pla (fish sauce)
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1    Clove garlic, peeled
1 ts Black peppercorns, crushed
1/2 ts Sugar
1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
Preheat the broiler and position the rack 5 to 6 inches from the
broiler element.  Lightly oil a baking sheet with sides.  Set snapper
fillets skin-side-down on the prepared baking sheet. Mix together 4 T
of the nam pla and wine and pour over the fillets. Broil until the
fish is opaque and flakes easily, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate
to cool. With your fingers, flake the fish into a shallow bowl.
Combine garlic, black peppercorns and sugar in a mortar & pestle and
pound to a paste (Alternatively, finely chop garlic and combine it
with black pepper and sugar in a small bowl, mashing the mixture
against the side with a spoon). Stir lime juice and the remaining 2 T
nam pla into the garlic mixture. Heat a skillet or wok over
medium-high heat and add oil, swirling to coat the pan.  Once the oil
is hot, toss in basil leaves. Lower heat to medium and stir-fry for a
scant 30 seconds.  Add the basil to the fish, then pour the dressing
over and toss. (The salad can be prepared ahead to this point and
stored, covered, in the refrigerator up to 2 hours.) Just before
serving, line a platter with lettuce leaves and mound the salad in
the center. From Eating Well Magazine, Apr '95.  329 calories per
