Title: Argentine Marinade
Categories: So. america, Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
1 ts Thyme
1 tb Lemon juice
Salt & pepper
1/2 ts Saffron threads
1/2 c  Virgin olive oil (1 20ml)
1/2 c  White wine vinegar (1 20 ml)
1    Spanish onion, diced
2    Garlic cloves, pressed
An Argentine asado or barbecue is not authentic without this delicious
marinade called chimichuri. it is similar to a multi spiced
vinaigrette and is given an earthier tone with the addition of
saffron.

I serve this with poultry or shellfish and brush it on top of garlic
bread before toasting.

Powder threads and steep in lemon juice for 20 minutes.  Combine all
ingredients with whisk and store in covered jar.
