Title: Sharon's Sink Salad
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
-just throw them in
1/2 md Daikon, cubed (OR bunch of
-radishes, sliced)
1    Green pepper, diced
1    Yellow pepper, diced
1    Orange pepper, diced
1    Red pepper, diced
1    Head lettuce, or more
2 md Carrots, peeled and grated
4    Stalks celery, sliced
4    To 5 green onions, chopped
2 c  Purple/red cabbage, sliced
-thin
1 1/2 c  Frozen peas, not thawed,
OR... 2 cups worth of assorted colors (we LIKE peppers..) 8-} 1/2
cucumber (if desired) peeled and seeded handful of fresh bean
sprouts, chopped in half or thirds

Clean sink. 8-}  Fill 1/2 way to top with cold water.  Tear lettuce
up and throw in.  Chop the rest of the ingredients and throw in.  Let
sit in sink for an hour or two.  Drain and serve. Makes about 1-1/2
large ziploc bags full...  Will keep for up to 5 days.

When serving, that's when I add any tomatoes or mushrooms.  Just
slice them and serve them on the side.  If served with croutons and
bacon bits, it can be a meal in itself...  8-}

**MY NOTES**  I take handfuls out and let it sit in the colander
draining and then pack it away in large ziploc bags.  Makes about 1
1/2 ziploc bags full...  Great if you are having company over...and
makes a great lunch all by itself.... Just add some canned salmon,
tuna, or sprinkle with fresh shrimp... YUM!!  8-}
