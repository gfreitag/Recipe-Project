with circles of wax paper, then butter and flour the paper.  In a
medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and
salt. In a medium bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter and
sugar. Beat in the sour cream.  Beat in the yolks one at a time. Beat
in the vanilla. In three additions, alternately stir in the flour
mixture and the milk, beating well after each addition.  Fold in the
semisweet chocolate. Spread the batter in the prepared pans and bake
for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a rack for 20
minutes. Then invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely.
For ganache, place the milk chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small
saucepan, bring the cream to a boil.  Pour over the chocolate. Let
stand, covered, for 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Chill in the
refrigerator for 1 hour.  To assemble: With an electric mixer, slowly
beat the ganache until thickened and smooth; be carefull not to
overbeat or it will separate.  Spread 1 1/2 cups of teh ganache over
the bottom cake layer.  Sprinkle with half of teh chopped toffee. Top
with the second cake layer.  Frost with the remaining ganache.
Sprinkle the top of the cake with the remaining toffee. Refrigerate
until ready to serve. Source: Mrs Fields I Love Chocolate Cookbook
