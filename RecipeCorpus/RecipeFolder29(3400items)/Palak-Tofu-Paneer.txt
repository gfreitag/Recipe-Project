Title: Palak Tofu-Paneer
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
3    -Garlic cloves, crushed
1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Ground coriander
3/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Cloves
2 tb Soy sauce
1 lb Chinese firm tofu; drained
-- cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1/4 c  Soy sauce
Oil for deep-frying
2 tb Margarine or butter
2 1/2 lb Frozen, chopped spinach
6 c  3/4" cubes fresh tomatoes
2 tb Ghee or safflower oil
2 ts Curry powder
2 ts Asafetida;  OR...
Soak first 2 ingredients together while heating the oil to 350
degrees. Remove cubes from soy sauce and drain a few seconds in a
strainer to remove excess soy sauce.  Drop tofu cubes in heated oil
all at once (or in a couple of separate batches if you desire) and
cook till browned and a little crisp on the outside.  Remove from oil
and drain on plate covered with 2 to 3 thicknesses of paper towels.
Leftover soy sauce can be kept and used later.

As the tofu cubes are cooking (or before you start frying them),
combine the next 3 ingredients together in a skillet.  Cover and put
on medium flame to simmer for 10 minutes.  Remove lid and mix well
(the frozen spinach should be thawed and mixable by now).

Leave uncovered over medium flame to allow some of the juices to cook
off as you make the chaunce.  This is done by heating the ghee or oil
in a butter-warming pot and adding all the spices listed.  Toast in
oil till the fragrance of the spices fills the kitchen and the spices
appear to be browned.  Pour into cooking vegetables immediately, add
soy sauce and mix thoroughly till tomatoes break up.

Turn off heat, add cooked tofu cubes, and cover for a few minutes
before serving.  Makes 8 entree-sized servings or twice as many side
dish sized servings.
