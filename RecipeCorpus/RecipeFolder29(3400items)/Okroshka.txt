This chilled meat and vegetable soup is a popular Russian dish. It's
served with ice cubes in it.  Since there's no substitute for Russian
Kvass, a fermented and slightly alcoholic liquid made from grain, the
ingredients in this recipe will have to do.

You may substitute 3 cup beef stock and 1 cup white wine for the apple
cider.

Dice meat.  Peel and dice cucumber and eggs.  Slice green onions.
Combine first 4 ingredients.  Mix together sugar, mustard, sour
cream, and cider, and beat well.  Add beef mixture and chill.  Serve
