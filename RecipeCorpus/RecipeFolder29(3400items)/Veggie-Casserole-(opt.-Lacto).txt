Title: Veggie Casserole (opt. Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree, Casseroles, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Garlic cloves to taste
2    To 3 cups frozen vegetables.
(I used corn)
1/2    To 1 cup grated ff cheese
(optional)
1 ea Cooked couscous or other
Grain of choice
1 cn Red kidney beans, drained.
(the mid-sized can)
1 cn Chick peas, drained. (same
Size)
2 cn Tomatos (larger sized
cn ..16_oz/_500_mL, I think)
1    Green pepper, chopped
1 lg Onion, diced
Combine all ingredients in large casserole dish, and bake in 400F
oven for 45 mins.

You may add 1/2- 1 cup grated ff cheese the last ten minutes of
cooking, but I don't think it really needs it.

Serve over couscous (or any other grain you like)

It was rather liquid, next time, I think I will drain the tomatoes,
reserving liquid, and adding until it "looks right"
