Commercial granolas will sabotage your special diet. ere's why:
They're usually sweetened with sugar, honey, or maple syrup and are
loaded with fat.  Besides that, wheat germ or bran fortify some
brands and many contain raisins, dates or other dried fruits.

This granola contains only 2Tb of fruit and 2 ts of oil in a whole
cup of granola.  When you make your own granola, use different nuts,
seeds, oil or fruits to customize the recipe.

Ingredients:

3 c rolled oats 1/2 c sunflower seeds 1/2 c almonds, halved or
coarsely chopped 1 - 2 ts cinnamon 1/4 ts salt, optional 1/4 c almond
or sunflower oil 1/4 c pineapple juice 1/2 c mashed banana Preheat
oven to 350F. Combine oats, seeds, almonds, cinnamon and salt in a
large mixing bowl. In a blender jar combine the oil, pineapple juice
and mashed banana, and blend briefly.  Pour the thick liquid over the
oat mixture and blend well.

Spread on a large jelly roll pan (cookie sheet with edges) and bake
for about 45 min, stirring the granola 2 or 3 times.  When light
brown, remove from oven - it crisps as it cools.  Store the cooled
granola in tightly-capped glass jars, in a cool place.  Serve with
Almond Milk (see recipe) or Pineapple-Banana Milk (see recipe).
