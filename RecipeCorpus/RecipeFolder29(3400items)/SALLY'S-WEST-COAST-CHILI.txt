"We often have chili cook-offs at our church, so we trade lots of
different recipes.  I was always mixing and matching ingredients and
experimenting, trying to come up with an original recipe that would
be a little different. That's how I developed this one, and I never
fail to get compliments on it! ~ Sally Grisham In a large kettle or
Dutch oven, cook bacon until crisp; remove to paper towel to drain.
Drain all but 3 Tbsp. drippings. Brown stew meat in the drippings.
Add onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft. Return bacon to
kettle. Add all the remaining ingredients except kidney beans and
cheese. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer until beef is
tender, about 3-4 hours. Add beans and heat through. Top each serving
with cheese.
