Title: Old Kentucky Beer Cheese
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Dips/spread
Yield: 15 servings
1 ts Dry Mustard
Tabasco Sauce, to taste
6 oz Beer, Or More As Necessary
1 ts Salt, or to taste
2 lb Sharp Cheddar Cheese,
At room temperature
2    Cloves Garlic, mashed
3 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1. Cut the cheese into cubes and place them in processor or mixer.
Process until perfectly smooth. Add the garlic, Worcestershire,
mustard, and Tabasco. Blend well.

2. Add the beer, a little at a time, while continuing to beat, until
mixture is of a good, firm spreading consistency. (Too much beer will
make the cheese too fluffy.) Stir in the salt, and refrigerate. (This
keeps superbly.)

3. Serve on small slices of rye or pumpernickel, or on crackers.
Delicious with cold, cold beer.
