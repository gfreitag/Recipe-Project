Title: Juji's Naan (Leavened Flat Breads)
Categories: Breads, Indian
Yield: 9 loaves
1 3/4 c  Plain yogurt
Unsalted butter (optional)
-- softened
3 1/4 c  Unbleached white flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.  Slowly add as
much yogurt as you need to gather the flour together and make a soft,
resilient dough.  Knead for about 10 minutes and form a ball.  Put
the ball in a bowl and cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth.  Set
aside in a warm place for 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  Knead the dough again
and divide into nine equal parts. Keep them covered. Heat a cast-iron
skillet or griddle over a lowish flame, and preheat the broiler. Take
one of the parts of dough and make a ball out of it.  Flatten it and
then roll out on a lightly floured surface until you have a round
that is about 1/8 inch thick. When the skillet is very hot, pick up
the naan and slap it onto the heated surface. Let it cook slowly for
about 4 to 5 minutes. Now put the skillet under the broiler for 1 to
1-1/2 minutes or until the puffing-up process is complete and there
are a few reddish spots on the naan.  Remove the naan with a spatula
and brush with butter if you like.  Make all the naans this way,
keeping them stacked and covered with a clean dishcloth.  Serve hot.
If you wish to have the naans later, wrap them in a plastic bag when
they have cooled. Before you eat, wrap as many as you need in
aluminum foil and heat in an oven at 400 F for 15 minutes. * Source:
