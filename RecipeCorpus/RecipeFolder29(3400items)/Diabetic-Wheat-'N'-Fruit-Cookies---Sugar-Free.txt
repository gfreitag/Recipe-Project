Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Cake/cookie
Yield: 5 dozen
1/8 ts Salt;
1 c  Unsweetened coconut; flaked
1 c  Unsugared dates; chopped
4 ts Orange peel; fresh grated
1 c  Pecans; finely ground
1/2 c  Butter; softened
1    Egg;
2 ts Vanilla extract;
1 c  Whole wheat flour;
1 ts Baking powder;
Cream the butter, egg and vanilla together in a large mixing bowl. In
a small bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, baking powder and salt.
Add the flour mixture a little at a time, to the creamed mixture,
beating after each addition. In a medium bowl, combine the coconut,
dates, orange peel, and 1/2 cup of the pecans. Stir into the cookie
mixture. Divide the dough in half and form into two logs,
approximately 1.1/2 inches in diameter. Place the remaining 1/2 cup
of pecans on a piece of waxed paper. Roll the logs in the nuts. Wrap
each log in waxed paper and chill for 1 hour. To bake, slice the logs
into 1/8 inch rounds and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly browned.

Makes 5 dozen.
