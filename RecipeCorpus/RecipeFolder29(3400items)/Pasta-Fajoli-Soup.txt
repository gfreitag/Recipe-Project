Olive Garden Restaurant's PASTA FAJOLI SOUP (from Winnipeg Free Press
Recipe Column)

1.  Bring Clamato juice, tomatoes, consomme and rest of ingredients
from the first column to a boil. Simmer for half an hour. 2. Saute
ground beef until browned thoroughly and set aside. 3. Saute
vegetables (onion, celery, carrots and cabbage) until soft. Add to
soup and simmer for another half an hour. 4.  Add kidney beans, navy
beans, cooked pasta and meat. Continue to simmer for another 20
minutes.

This makes a great meal accompanied by bread or buns of your choice
and a green salad.

NOTE:  I omitted the beans (my family doesn't like them) and the
cabbage (didn't have any in the fridge) and the soup was still an
overwhelming success without them.
