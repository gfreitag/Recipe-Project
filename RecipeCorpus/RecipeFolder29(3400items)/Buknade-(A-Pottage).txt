2-3 sprigs each of fresh parsley and hyssop
2-3 sage leaves
1.1 litres/2 pints/5 cups chicken stock
Good pinch each of ground mace, ground cloves, pulverised dried
saffron
strands and salt
350 g/12 oz cooked chicken meat without skin, cut in small thin
slices or
flakes
3-4 egg yolks (depending on how rich you want your pottage)
1/2-1 teaspoon cider vinegar White pepper and ground ginger to taste

Chop the herb leaves fairly finely, discarding the stems.  Put the
chopped leaves in a saucepan with the stock and sprinkle in the mace,
cloves, saffron and salt.  Bring to simmering point and add the
shredded meat. Simmer until it is well heated through, while giving
the egg yolks a quick beating to liquify them.  Beat into them a
little hot stock, then pour the mixture back into the pan and stir
for a few moments over the lowest possible heat to blend and thicken
the liquid slightly. Add the vinegar, pepper and ginger.

Serve as soup, or as a fairly liquid stew.

Variations: Use veal (or kid) if you wish rather than chicken, and
start with raw meat if you prefer. However, it seems foolish to go to
the labour of shredding raw meat when it is easier to make a useful
and pleasant dish with left-over cooked meat.
