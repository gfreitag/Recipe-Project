1 ea To 1-1/2 cup unsalted
-peanuts
1 ts Vanilla
3 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
1/4 c  Cocoa, or 1 square
-unsweetened chocolate
Melt 1 cup sugar in a 10" heavy skillet over medium high heat,
stirring constantly until it liquefies and is light brown or amber in
color. Remove from heat just long enough to add 1/2 cup milk, a few
drops at a time at first, stirring vigorously as mixture bubbles up.
Return to heat and add remaining 2 cups sugar, sifted with cocoa and
1/2 cup milk. Cook to the soft ball stage (about 238).  Remove from
heat; mix in peanuts and vanilla. Let stand 15 minutes to cool
slightly, then stir until mixture begins to thicken. Pour at once
into a buttered 13 x 9 x 2" pan, spreading as thinly as possible so
that peanuts stand out. Store in covered container, in refrigerator
or freezer.  Makes about 72 pieces or 2 pounds. From: Homemade Candy,
