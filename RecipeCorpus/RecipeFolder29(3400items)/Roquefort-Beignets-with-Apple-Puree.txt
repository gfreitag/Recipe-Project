For Crepes: ===========
Combine the eggs, milk and a 1/2 cup of water together.
Gradually add 1 cup of flour, whisking it in until smooth.

Whisk in the salt and pepper and Clarified butter.  Thin with
water, if necessary, to the consistency of whipping cream.  Cover and
refrigerate for several hours or overnight.

If the crepe batter has thickened in the refrigerator, thin it
with water to the consistency of whipping cream.  Brush a 7-inch
skillet (preferably non stick) with a thin film of olive oil.  Place
the skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, add about 3 tablespoons
of crepe batter and swirl to coat the pan.  Cook until the crepe is
lightly golden, about 1 minute; then turn it over and cook the second
side for 30 seconds. Continue with remaining batter, stacking crepes
between waxed paper.

For Fritter Batter: ===================
Sift 1/4 cup of flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt into a
mixing bowl.  In a second bowl, combine an egg, 1/4 cup of water and
vegetable oil and mix.  Gradually stir the liquid mixture into the
flour and mix just until smooth.  DO NOT OVER MIX.  Refrigerate,
covered.

For Filling: ============
Blend the Roquefort cheese and egg yolk (mixture will by lumpy).
Cut off any dry edges from the crepes, squaring them slightly. Place
a rounded teaspoonful of cheese mixture in the center of the spotty
side of a crepe, mounding it slightly.  Fold the crepe into thirds
horizontally (as you would a letter), then fold the sides in so that
they overlap slightly, forming a neat package about 2 inches square.
Place these packets folded side down on a tray lined with waxed
paper; repeat with remaining crepes and filling.

Cover folded crepes with damp cloth, then with plastic wrap,
then with aluminum foil.  Chill several hours or overnight.

In a large skillet or saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable
oil and heat to 375 F (a small piece of bread dropped into oil
sizzles steadily at this temperature.)

Thin the fritter batter with water, if necessary, so that it
flows from a spoon but is not watery.  Use 2 forks to dip folded
crepes into fritter batter; then lift them out, letting any excess
batter drain off, and transfer to the hot oil ( do not crowd.)

Fry until golden, turning once, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Drain on
paper towels and serve with apple puree.

This recipe makes 12 beignets (three per serving.)
