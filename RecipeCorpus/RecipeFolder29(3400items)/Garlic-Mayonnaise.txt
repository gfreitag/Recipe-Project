Title: Garlic Mayonnaise
Categories: Condiments, Herbs/spice, Cajun/creol
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Tabasco sauce -- (optional)
1/4 ts White pepper
1/4 ts Cayenne -- ground
1    Egg plus 1 egg yolk
2 c  Vegetable oil
2 1/2 tb Garlic -- minced
2 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Very finely chopped onions
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt
In a 1-quart saucepan combine the garlic, butter, onions, lemon
juice, salt Tabasco, and white and cayenne peppers.  Saute over
medium-low heat for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove
from heat and let cool for 15 minutes.

In a food processor or blender, beat the egg and egg yolk for 30
seconds. Then beat in the sauteed mixture for about 15 seconds. With
the machine still running, slowly add the oil in a thin, steady
stream; process until thick and creamy, about 15 seconds more,
pushing the sides down once with a rubber spatula.  Refrigerate for
at least 30 minutes before serving.
