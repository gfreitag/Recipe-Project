1 tb Allspice
2 ts Thyme
1/3 c  Flour

Put the meat in a bowl and add wine, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon
of thyme.  Let the mixture marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.

Line a terrine with the pork fat.

Grind up the meats (except the duck) and toss in a bowl with
salt, pepper, allspice, and 2 teaspoons thyme, flour, eggs, and
brandy.

Pack half of the mixture into the lined terrine.

Add the duck breasts and fat strips, then cover with the
remaining forcemeat.

Cover the contents of the terrine with foil and a good lid (to
weight it down and keep the filling from puffing up and running over
the side) and bake in a larger pan filled with water to half the
depth of the terrine.

Bake at 280 F for 2 to 3 hours or until the juices are clear.

Remove lid and cool.
