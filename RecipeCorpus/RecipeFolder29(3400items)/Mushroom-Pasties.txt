Title: Mushroom Pasties
Categories: Medieval, Vegetables, Pastry
Yield: 6 servings  Mushrooms of one night are the best, if they are small, red inside,
and closed at the top; and they should be peeled and then washed in
hot water and parboiled, and if you wish to put them in a pasty add
oil, cheese and spice powder.

450 g/1 lb home-made or bought shortcrust pastry, thawed if frozen
450 g/1 lb button mushrooms Salt 2 tablespoons olive oil 50 g/2 oz
Cheddar cheese, grated 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground
black pepper 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder 1 egg, beaten

Use two-thirds of the pastry to line small, deep pans.  Chill while
making the filling.  Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6.

Trim off the bottoms of the mushroom stems; then dip the mushrooms in
boiling salted water, holding them in a sieve.  Drain them, pat dry,
then chop or slice them.  Put them in a bowl and mix them with the
oil, cheese and seasonings.  Fill the mixture into the pastry cases.
Roll out the remaining pastry and use it to make lids for the
pasties. Seal the lids with beaten egg.  Decorate the tops with
pastry trimmings and brush with the remaining egg.  Make a small
cross-cut in the centre of each lid.

Bake the little pies in the oven for 15-18 minutes.  Serve warm.

At home, no doubt, the Goodman, who kept a well-furnished table, would
serve a large double-crust pastry or plate pie--but on his journeys
to and from the farm, small ones probably seemed more suitable.  Make
a 23-cm/9-inch plate pie if you prefer.
