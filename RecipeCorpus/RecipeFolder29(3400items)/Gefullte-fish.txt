Remove the skin and bones from the fish. Pike is often used. Put the
fish and onions through a fine food chopper. Put this mixture in a
large bowl and add the egg, water, salt, Matzo meal and pepper. Mix
well until fluffy. Place the fish heads, skin and bones in a large
pot with the 4th onion, carrots salt and pepper to taste and cover

the ground fish mixture into small balls. Drop them into the boiling
stock. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 2 hrs. Remove the fish balls.
Boil uncovered to reduce the stock, strain it, and thicken with egg
yolks. Serve sauced with horseradish on the side.
