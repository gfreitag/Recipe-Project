For Almond Meringue Layers: ===========================

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or butter and flour
it). Using a pencil and 8-inch souffle dish as guide, trace 2 circles
exactly the diameter of dish onto parchment paper.  Fold sheet of
parchment or waxed paper in half lengthwise and lightly oil one side
of paper and wrap it around souffle dish so it extends 3 inches above
top of dish, taping it securely with masking tape.

Preheat the oven to 200 F. Beat 2 egg whites until they form
stiff peaks.  Stir together ground almonds and sugar and gently fold
into beaten egg whites.  Transfer mixture to pastry bag fitted with
round 1/2-inch tip. Starting in the center and spiraling outward,
form 2 8-inch circles 1/4 inch thick.  Bake until crisp, about 1 1/2
hours. Cool on a rack.

For Mousse: ===========

Choose a few perfect raspberries for garnish and set aside. Puree
remaining raspberries in processor or blender until very smooth.
Transfer 2 tablespoons of puree, with seeds, to measuring cup.
Strain remaining puree into mixing bowl, eliminating all seeds.  Add
enough strained puree to the 2 tablespoons to measure 1/2 cup.  Set
aside. Chill remaining strained puree, which will be used as sauce.

In a small heavy saucepan combine sugar, water, and corn syrup.
Bring slowly to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally and
brushing down any sugar crystals from sides of pan with brush dipped
in cold water. Raise heat slightly and cook until temperature of
syrup reaches 240 F (soft ball stage).  While syrup is cooking, beat
3 egg whites in a mixer until stiff. As soon as syrup reaches 240 F,
lower mixer speed to slow and pour hot syrup onto beaten whites, in a
very thing stream. When all of the syrup has been incorporated, raise
a mixer speed and beat meringue until cool.

Stir together the 1/2 cup reserved raspberry puree and lemon
juice and fold into the meringue until nearly blended.  Whip cream
until stiff and fold into the meringue until blended.  DO NOT OVERMIX.

To Assemble: ============

Spread 3/4-inch layer of mousse in prepared souffle dish.
Carefully peel off the paper from a meringue layer and place the
layer on top. Repeat, adding 3/4-inch layer of mousse, then remaining
meringue layer. Top with remaining mousse, smoothing it gently with
spatula. Freeze at least 3 hours.

To serve, carefully remove paper collar.  Smooth exposed edge of
souffle, if necessary, with a metal spatula.  Use a knife blade or
long metal spatula to score shallow crisscross pattern in top of
souffle. Garnish with reserved raspberries.  Serve in wedges,
spooning a little of the chilled raspberry puree around each portion
and serving remainder separately.
