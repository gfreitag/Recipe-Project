Title: Spiced Whole Wheat Pumpkin Loaf
Categories: Breads, Cake/cookie, Vegetables
Yield: 1 loaf
3/4 c  Chopped, pitted dates
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
8 tb Unsalted butter; softened
3/4 c  Light brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
2    Extra-large eggs
3/4 c  Canned pumpkin (not pumpkin
-pie filling)
1 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/2 c  Unsifted whole wheat flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
3/4 c  Dark raisins
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter and flour a 8x4x3-inch loaf pan.

Sift together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda,
baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.  Toss the raisins,
dates and walnuts with 1 tablespoon of the sifted mixture.

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on moderate
speed for 5 minutes.  Add the sugar and beat on moderately high speed
for 2 minutes.  Blend in the vanilla extract.  Beat in the eggs, one
at a time, blending well after each addition.  Beat in the pumpkin.
The mixture will look curdled.  On low speed, add the sifted
ingredients, mixing until the particles of flour are absorbed.  Stir
in the raisin-date-walnut mixture.

Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the loaf for
50 to 55 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted into each loaf
emerges clean and dry.  The baked loaf will pull away slightly from
the sides of the pan.

Cool the loaf in the pan on a rack for 3 to 4 minutes, invert onto
another rack and turn rightside up.  Cool completely.  Store in an
airtight container.
