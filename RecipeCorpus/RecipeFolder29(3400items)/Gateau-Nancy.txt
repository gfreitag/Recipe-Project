Title: Gateau Nancy
Categories: Desserts, Masterchefs
Yield: 24 servings
1 ts Extract, vanilla
1 tb Almond, powder
10 md Egg yolks
10 md Egg whites
1 1/2 c  Sugar
Creme Anglaise **
14 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet,
-- crumbled
7 oz Butter, sweet
2 tb Grand Marnier
** A recipe for this ingredient can be found elsewhere in this
packet.

In a bowl, put the chocolate, butter, Grand Marnier, vanilla
extract, and almond powder together and mix.  Melt the ingredients
over a double boiler.  Remove the mixture from the heat as soon as
it's melted and whip lightly.

In another bowl, whip the egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar until a
white ribbon is formed, about 5-7 minutes.  Blend this sugar/yolk
mixture gently into the chocolate mixture with a spatula.

In another bowl, whip the egg whites vigorously.  Slowly add 3/4
cup of sugar, whipping the mixture until lightly firm.  Fold the egg
whites/sugar mixture into the chocolate mixture blending lightly as
for a souffle.

Butter and flour two molds 10 inches in diameter and 2 inches
deep. Place a sheet of parchment on the bottom of each mold.  Put
half of the mixture in each of the molds and bake at 275 F for 1 hour
and 20 minutes.

Unmold and cool the gateau on a rack.  To serve, sprinkle with
powdered sugar and serve with Creme Anglaise.
