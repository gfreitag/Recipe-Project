If you want to, you can use fewer egg yolks and more breadcrumbs, but
the consistency will not be as smooth.

Sieve the egg yolks on to a sheet of paper.  Bring the honey for the
slices to the boil and simmer for 2 minutes.  Take the pan off the
heat. Add the sieved yolks little by little to the pan, beating or
stirring rapidly to blend them in smoothly.  Then blend in the
breadcrumbs and pepper; use sufficient breadcrumbs to make the
mixture stiff enough to mould. Shape it into a brick and chill until
cold and firm. Cut it into small slices like halva.

Simmer the ingredients for the syrup until the wine is well reduced.
Spoon a little over each slice before serving.

Serve with small spoons as a sweet mouthful with coffee.
