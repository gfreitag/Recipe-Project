Squirrel is one of the finest and tenderest of all wild meats.  It's
flavor is mild, rarely gamey.  There is no need for soaking, and
seldom any need for parboiling.  They should be cleaned as soon as
possible after shooting, but skinning may wait until they're ready to
be cooked. Clean squirrels and rub with salt and pepper.  Brush with
fat andplace on hot broiling rack. Broil 40 minutes, turning
frequently and basting with drippins every 10 minutes.  Serve with
gravy from drippins and season with 1-2 tbsp of lemon juice.

FRIED SQUIRREL:

Make sure all the hair is cleaned off the squirrel.  Cut it up.  If
it's old and tough, put it in the pressure cooker for about 15-20
minutes. Salt and pepper it.  Cover with flour and fry in a cast iron
skillet on a medium fire until brown and tender.  This is areal sweet
meat.  You can smother a squirrel just like a chicken.
