Title: Dried Cranberries
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
1 1/2 c  Water
3 c  Sugar
12 oz Pkg fresh cranberries
Dried cranberries can be purchased in specialty stores, or you can
try this recipe to make your own.

Mix the ingredients together in a large non-stick saucepan and bring
to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer 20-25 minutes. Drain in a
strainer, reserving the syrup. Preheat the oven to 300F. and line a
jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Spoon the berries on the paper,
separating and spreading them out in a single layer. Bake for 30
minutes to dry them out, then store, tightly covered. The syrup can
be boiled down for 10 minutes, cooled and stored for use over
pancakes.
