"I like to bring my mom's fruit salad to potlucks.  Its smooth suace
combined with all the colorful fruit makes it different than any other
fruit salad I've tried.  I've given out the recipe more times than I
can remember."  -- Ann Heinonen, Howell, Michigan.

Drain pineapple, reserving 1 cup juice in a small saucepan.  Set
pineapple aside.  To saucepan, add sugar, flour, eggs, orange juice,
lemon juice and oil.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Boil for
1 minute; remove from the heat and let cool.  In a salad bowl,
combine the pineapple, fruit cocktail, oranges and bananas.  Fold in
whipped cream and cooled sauce. Chill for several hours.
