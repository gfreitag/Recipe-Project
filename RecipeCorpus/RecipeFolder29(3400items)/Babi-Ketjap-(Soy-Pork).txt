There are quite a few pork dishes in the book (including another
version of this one).  Evidently minorities are well enough
represented that pork has earned a place in the cuisine of
predominantly Muslim Indonesia. I think this would be excellent done
with 1 inch long pieces of baby back ribs. I also won't stew it as
long as I did++or maybe use bigger chunks of pork. I used pieces
between a half and a quarter inch on a side and the meat got a tad
dried out. No complaint on the taste though! I'll also toss in a
couple of scallions cut into one inch chunks just before it's done
stewing. I was out of sambal oelek so I used some tuong ot toi cut
with a little lime juice.  Worked good.

Dice Pork, rub in salt and pepper and fry in hot oil or margarine.
Then add the finely sliced onions, spices and the hot pepper
condiment.

After this add the water and the soy sauce.  Bring to the boil and
simmer for at least half an hour until the meat is done.

Serve Babi Ketjap on a large plate, garnish with sliced tomatoes and
chopped vegetable pickles.  Eat with plain or savory rice or Mei.

From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London,
1986."

For those who aren't familiar with it, Kecap Manis (or ketjap manis)
is a thick, sweet Indonesian soy sauce that does wonderful things for
meat and poultry as a marinade/BBQ sauce as well as a condiment.
