Title: Super Playdough
Categories: Kids, Information
Yield: 3 cups
4 ts Cream of tartar
2 c  Water
2 tb Corn oil
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Salt
2 pk Unsweetened Kool-Aid
-any flavor
Mix all the ingredients together in a large saucepan. Cook and stir
over low heat until the mixture thickens and the bottom is just
starting to crust up, about 15 minutes. The dough will be very stiff
and hard at this point.

Turn the dough out onto a large cookie sheet and let it cool. When
cool, knead until smooth. Store in a covered container.

Note: Leave the Kool-Aid out if you're working with young kids; they
might try to eat it.
