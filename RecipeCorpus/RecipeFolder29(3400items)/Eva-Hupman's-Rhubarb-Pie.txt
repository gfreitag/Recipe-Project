Title: Eva Hupman's Rhubarb Pie
Categories: Countyfairs, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
Red Food Coloring,
Few Drops, optional
4 ts Butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Flour
1 tb Cornstarch
3 c  Rhubarb, Pink, 1-inch cubes
MMMMM-------------------------THE PASTRY------------------------------
2/3 c  Lard
5 tb Water
2 c  Flour, sifted
1 ts Salt
* Heat oven to 425 F.

1. Mix all the filling ingredients except the butter together. Let
stand while you make the pastry.

2. Mix the flour and salt together. Cut in the lard with a pastry
cutter, just until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle the
water over the mixture and combine with a fork. If it's a hot day,
chill the pastry briefly in the freezer before rolling it out.

3. Roll out the bottom crust and line a 9-inch pie pan with it. Pile
the filling in the shell and dot with butter. Make a lattice topping
and flute the edges.

4. Bake the pie in the center of the oven for 10 to 15 mins. Reduce
heat to 350 F, and bake 30 to 40 mins longer, until rhubarb is tender
when pierced with a skewer.

Note: At the time of publication, Eva Hupman was almost 100 years old
and making her pies with lard. Draw your own conclusions.
