Clean possum and rub inside and out with salt and pepper.  Saute the
onions, then add to the remaining ingredients except for the water and
bacon. Combine together and stuff the possum.  Place stuffed possum
in a large roasting pan, add water to the pan, and lay bacon strips
across the back of the possum.  Roast uncovered in a 350F oven for
