Preheat oven to 325. Rinse the meat with water. Pat it dry. Rub the
meat on all sides with crushed garlic and then sprinkle with salt,
pepper and paprika. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed casserole, and
brown the meat on all sides. Add the onion, carrots and celery. Cover
meat with water or tomato juice or tomato sauce and sprinkle with
dried onion soup. Cover and bake in the oven for 3 hours. Before
serving, remove lid and brown 1/2 hour more. This dish is best
prepared a day in advance so the fat is easily skimmed off before the
brisket is reheated.
