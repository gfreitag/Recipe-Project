a dutch oven; add enough water to cover the ribs.  Bring to boiling.
Reduce heat and simmer, covered, about 1 1/2 hours or until meat is
tender. Drain ribs.  Meanwhile, for sauce, in medium saucepan cook
onion and garlic in hot oil until tender but not brown.  Stir in
catsup, vinegar, molasses, red pepper, chili powder, hot pepper sauce
and dry mustard. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer,
uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Preheat gas grill.
Adjust heat for indirect cooking. Place precooked ribs on gas grill
over medium heat. Brush with sauce. Cover and grill for 15 minutes,
turning once halfway through and brushing frequently with sauce. Pass
any remaining sauce.  429 calories and 15 grams fat.  Source: BH & G
