Title: Clarified Butter - Master Chefs
Categories: Basics, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 6 fl. ounces
1/2 lb Butter, unsalted
Cut any amount of unsalted butter into pieces and melt slowly in
saucepan.  Skim off as much foam as possible from surface.  Carefully
pour off all clear golden liquid (this is the clarified butter),
leaving all milky residue in bottom of pan (discard residue.)

Clarified butter keeps well, tightly sealed, in refrigerator or
freezer.  One half pound of butter (2 sticks) yields about 3/4 cup
clarified butter.
