Categories: Pasta, Cheese/eggs, Medieval
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 6 SERVINGS--------------------------
9-10 sheets lasagne (broad    1 11/16 l  Pints/7 1/2 cups meat or
-chicken stock or water
Butter for greasing
-noodles) made with white
-flour
Ground mace and cardamom or cinnamon and a little white pepper for
spicing About 175 g/6 oz full-fat hard cheese (such as Cheddar),
grated Choose a square or oblong baking dish which will hold the
pasta in three layers. If you pile it higher in a smaller dish, it
may be difficult to slice and serve six helpings. Bring the stock or
water to the boil in a fairly big pan and boil the lasagne in three
or four batches until all the sheets are cooked.  As each batch is
done, remove the sheets with tongs or a pair of forks to a warmed,
damp tea-towel on a flat work-top and lay them flat side by side.
Grease the inside of your chosen dish with butter. Sprinkle the
bottom lightly with spices and a quarter of the cheese.  Cover with a
layer of pasta, trimmed to fit the dish if required.  Repeat the
layers of spice, cheese and pasta twice, and end with a last layer of
spice and cheese. Re-heat until the cheese is melted. from The
