Categories: Asian, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings

1/4 ts Ground turmeric
Salt to taste
2 tb Lime juice
2 c  Coconut milk
2    Stalks lemon grass or 1

Split open the game hens from the breast side and flatten them out
into a butterfly shape.  Discard loose skin and fat.  Broil the hens
for 3 minutes on each side.

Process the shallots, garlic, coriander, chile, ginger, turmeric,
salt, lime juice and 1/2 cup of the coconut milk to a smooth sauce.
Marinate the hens in the sauce for 15 minutes.

Put the hens in a large skillet and cook over moderate heat for 10
minutes uncovered.  Then add the remaining coconut milk and the lemon
grass. Bring to a boil and cook for 30 minutes, basting occasionally,
until the hens are tender and almost all the liquid has evaporated.

Serve warm.

Serves 4.
