Title: Apricot Conserve
Categories: Condiments, Fruit
Yield: 7 quarts
-finely chopped
-rind and all
-in a food processor
3 c  Chopped walnuts
-lightly toasted
3 lb Dried apricots
3 lb Golden raisins
3 1/2 lb Sugar
3 lg Oranges, seeded
-cut in small pieces
Put apricots in a large, heavy saucepan and pour over just enough
water to cover them. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer
apricots until tender, 10-15 minutes. Add raisins, sugar and chopped
oranges.

Simmer for  hour, stirring. When the conserve is as thick as you like
(it will become thicker as it cools), remove it from the heat. Cool
and stir in the walnuts.

You can seal this in sterilized jars if you like, or put it in a
crock in the refrigerator.
