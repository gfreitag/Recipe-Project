Title: Chipotle Cornbread
Categories: Fatfree, Breads
Yield: 8 servings
2    Egg whites, lightly beaten
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Soy milk
6 tb Apple sauce
4    Canned chipotles, pureed
1 ea Pam
1 c  Coarsely ground yellow
Cornmeal
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and prehead two 6-inch cast iron
skillets in the oven for 20 minutes. * This was the originally
recipe, but I used one 8-inch pie pan.

2.  In a mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt and
baking powder.  Fold in the egg, buttermilk, milk, apple sauce, and
pureed chipotles

3.  Put non-stick stuff on pans and immediately pour in the batter,
approximately three-fourths of the way up.  Bake for 25 minutes, or
until the cornbread is brown around the edges and firm.  Cut each
cornbread into 4 wedges.
