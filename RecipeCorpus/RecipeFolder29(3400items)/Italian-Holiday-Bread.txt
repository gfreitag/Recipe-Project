Title: Italian Holiday Bread
Categories: Breads, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 loaves
5    Eggs, 2 whole+3 yolks
1 ts Salt
4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Yeast
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Warm water (100-115 F.)
1/2 c  Butter, melted
MMMMM----------------------GLAZING MIXTURE---------------------------
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Water
1    Egg yolk
2 ts Flour
Dissolve yeast and 1/2 cup brown sugar in the water and allow to
proof. Stir in the melted butter, 2 whole eggs plus 3 egg yolks,
salt, and blend well.  Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, beating in
well.

Turn the dough out on a floured surface and knead in additional flour
until you have a soft velvety dough with no trace of stickiness.
About 5 minutes of kneading should be enough.

Divide the dough into equal portions.  Flatten and shape into round
loaves. Place on a greased baking sheet and cover with a tent of
aluminum foil and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled
in bulk (about 1-2 hours).  Mix up the glazing mixture and brush over
the tops of the two loaves.  You can add a few decorative slashes
with a sharp knife and sprinkle with a little brown sugar if desired.

Bake at 325 F. for 35-40 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow
when rapped on top and sides with your knuckles.  Cool on rack before
slicing. Submitted By ROBERT WHITE   On   04-20-95
