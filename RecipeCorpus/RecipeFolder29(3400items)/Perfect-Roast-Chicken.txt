Title: Perfect Roast Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Coarse Kosher salt
1 c  Water
3 lb Chicken
3    Thin-skinned lemons
1 lg Garlic clove(s)
Preheat oven to 400F. Remover giblets and excess fat from cavity of
chicken.

Roll lemons to soften them. Pierce each lemon with a skewer in about
20 places. Peel garlic and put it through a garlic press.

In a small bowl, mash the garlic together with the salt. When you
have a nice paste, smear half of it inside the chicken's cavity. Then
put in the lemons. (You may not be able to fit all 3 of them. Truss
the chicken, if desired).

Rub the rest of the garlic paste all over the outside of the chicken.
Put the chicken on a rack and put the rack in a roasting pan. Pour
the water into the bottom of the pan.

Bake the chicken for 1 hour, or until the drumstick just begins to
move. Don't baste the chicken. You don't have to remove the lemons
from the chicken's cavity, but definitely serve the chicken with the
pan juices.
