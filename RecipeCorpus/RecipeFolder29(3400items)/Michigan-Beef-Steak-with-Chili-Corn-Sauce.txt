Title: Michigan Beef Steak with Chili-Corn Sauce
Categories: Meats, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 4 servings
5 tb Butter, unsalted
2 tb Water
36 ea Scallions (white only)
-- trimmed to 2 1/2"
1 x  Chili Corn Sauce *
2 tb Oil, vegetable (or more)
Salt
6 ea Steaks, sirloin OR **
6 ea Steaks, rib-eye **
* Recipe for CHILI CORN SAUCE follows in this packet.

** Steaks should be deboned and thoroughly trimmed (about 1/2 pound
each after trimming and deboning)

In a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil
until hot but not smoking.  Working in batches if necessary, salt
your steaks lightly and sear them on both sides over high heat, about
1 minute per side.

Using tongs to hold the steaks, sear their edges.

Lower the heat slightly and continue to cook steaks, turning them
once, until rare (4 1/2 to 5 minutes total.)

Meanwhile, in a separate skillet, heat the butter and water,
shaking the pan until they are blended.

Add scallions and cook over high heat, shaking the skillet
constantly, until crisp-tender (about 2 minutes.)

To Serve: =========

Place a steak in the center of each heated serving plate.  Warm
the chili corn sauce and adjust the seasoning to taste.  Spoon some
of the sauce around each steak.

Place 3 scallions on each side of each steak like spokes from
the hub of a wheel (the steak is the hub.)  Serve Immediately.
