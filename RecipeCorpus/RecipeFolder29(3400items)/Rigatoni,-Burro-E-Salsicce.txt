Title: Rigatoni, Burro E Salsicce
Categories: Pasta, Italian, Meats
Yield: 3 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
4 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Salt to taste
4 tb Unsalted butter
1    Italian sweet sausages
1/4 c  Medium cream
MMMMM---------------------------PASTA--------------------------------
5/8 lb Rigatoni or fettuccine
3 qt Water
3 ts Salt
Put half the butter in a serving bowl or platter, which you then
either put in the warming oven or use as a cover for the pasta pot as
the water comes to a boil, and let the butter melt.  Meanwhile, skin
the sausages (they should be the kind made without fennel and other
spices) and mash them up in a small frying pan with the rest of the
butter. Saute over medium heat until cooked but not crisp.  Add the
sausages and their butter to that in the serving dish, stir in the
cream and half of the Parmesan cheese. Once well mixed, salt to
taste, and put the dish in the warming oven while the pasta cooks.
Cook the pasta al dente and drain. Put it on top of the cream sauce
in the serving dish. Turn the pasta gently over and over until coated
with sauce and sausage bits.  Serve immediately and sprinkle with
remaining cheese.  From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco
