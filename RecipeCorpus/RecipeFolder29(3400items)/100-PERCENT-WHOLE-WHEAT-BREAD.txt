Title: 100 PERCENT WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 lg Egg; -=OR=-
2 lg Egg whites
1 ts Salt
1 pk Active dry yeast
3 tb Dark brown sugar
3/4 c  Warm water (105F-115F)
2 3/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
3 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5
minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with
dough hook, put flour, milk powder, oil and egg or egg whites into
bowl. Turn machine on and combine mixture. With machine running,
slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If
dough is too sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon, working it in
before adding more. If dough is crumbly and dry, add more water by
the teaspoon, working it in before adding more. Once desired
consistency is reached (moist but not sticky), mix dough until well
kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in food
processor, about 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put
ingredients in large bowl. Mix well. Make well in center, pour in
yeast mixture and work into ingredients, then knead on floured board
until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to large
plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in bowl.
Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Oil a baking
sheet. Punch dough down and shape into smooth ball. Place smooth side
up on baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in
warm spot until doubled, about 40-50 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F.
Fifteen minutes before baking, put rack in center of oven; dust dough
top lightly with flour. Make a decorative slash across the top. Bake
until bread is well browned and sounds hollow when rapped on bottom,
about 30-35 minutes. Immediately remove from pan and cool on rack.
