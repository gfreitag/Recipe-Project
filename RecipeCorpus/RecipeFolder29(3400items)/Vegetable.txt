Description: Kale is a hardy biennial plant grown as an annual. It's a
member of the cabbage family and looks like cabbage with a permanent
wave. Scotch kale has gray-green leaves that are extremely crumpled
and curly; Siberian or blue kale usually is less curly and is a bluer
shade of green. There are also decorative forms with lavender and
silver variegated leaves.

Storing And Preserving: If possible, leave kale in the garden until
you want to eat it. It will store in the refrigerator in a plastic
bag for up to one week, or in a cold, moist place for up to three
weeks. You can also freeze, can, or dry it; use recipes for greens.

Serving Suggestions: Young kale makes a distinctive salad green;
dress it simply with oil and vinegar. You can also cook it in a
little water and serve it with butter, lemon juice, and chopped
bacon. Instead of boiling, try preparing it like spinach steamed with
butter and only the water that clings to the leaves after washing.
The Italians steam kale until tender, then add olive oil, a little
garlic, and breadcrumbs, and sprinkle it with Parmesan cheese in the
last minute or two of cooking. You can also prepare kale Chinese
style, stir-fried with a few slices of fresh gingerroot.
