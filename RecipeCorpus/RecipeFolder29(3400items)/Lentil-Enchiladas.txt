Put water and beans in saucepan on med high heat. Add all ingredients
except salsa and tortillas. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionlly.
Reduce heat and let cook til lentils are soft, about 45 minutes.
(Keep stirring because the beans will stick to the bottom of the
pot.) Once the beans are mushy, add salsa, stir well.

Place in tortillas, garnish as desired, and enjoy.

NOTE: I didn't soak the beans beforehand and haven't experienced any
problems. Mary McD says, in this book, that you don't need to soak
lentils.
