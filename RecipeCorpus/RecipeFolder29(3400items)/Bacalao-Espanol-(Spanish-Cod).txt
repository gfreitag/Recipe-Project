Nice segue, eh?

Inherited from Spain, this codfish dish is a favorite of the
Mexicans. Soak codfish for 8 hours in enough cold water to cover it.
Drain and shred the fish.  Saute the onion in the oil until it is
softened. Add codfish and saute a few more minutes.  Add the
remaining ingredients. Simmer slowly until codfish is tender, about
1/2 hour or more.

Makes 4 servings.
