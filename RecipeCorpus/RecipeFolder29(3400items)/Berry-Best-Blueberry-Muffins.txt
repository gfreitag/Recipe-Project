Categories: Muffins, Low cal/fat
Yield: 6 -12 serves
2/3 c  Buttermilk
1/3 c  Applesauce
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Fresh or frozen blueberries
.(don't thaw frozen berries)
1 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Whole-wheat pastry flour

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Spray six large, 3-inch muffin cups
with nonfat, nonstick spray and set aside.

In a large bowl, stir together both flours, sugar, baking powder and
lemon peel, making sure all is evenly distributed.  Make a well in
the center of the mixture.

In a small bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy.  Stir in the
buttermilk, applesauce and vanilla.  Add the liquid mixture to the
dry mixture and stir until just moistened.  Fold in the blueberries.

Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, filling each 3/4 full.  Bake
for 22 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean.  Cool the muffins in the pan for 5 minutes, then
remove them to cool on a wire rack.

NOTE:  For standard-sized muffins, bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until
done.
