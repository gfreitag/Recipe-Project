Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Arrange the apples in a baking dish. In a small bowl, mix the flour,
sugar, and beaten eggs to crumb consistency with a fork (do not use
an electric beater). Sprinkle the crumb mixture over the apples.

In a separate bowl, stir the cinnamon into the melted butter and pour
over the apple-crumb mixture. Bake for 30 to 45 mins, or until the
apples are soft and lightly browned. Serve warm with ice cream or
whipped cream.
