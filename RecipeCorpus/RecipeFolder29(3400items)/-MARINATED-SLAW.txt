"This is a delectable dish that looks as good as it tastes. Mother
usually saved this recipe for special occasions, but when she did
make it, we sure enjoyed it.  The best part is the mouth-watering
dressing that even tempted us while it cooked." - Mary McGuire

In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, pimientos, green pepper and
onion. Toss lightly; set aside.  Combine the remaining ingredients in
a medium saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered,
for 20-25 minutes or until slightly thickened.  Pour over cabbage
mixture. Cover and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.  Slaw will keep
in the refrigerator for several days.
