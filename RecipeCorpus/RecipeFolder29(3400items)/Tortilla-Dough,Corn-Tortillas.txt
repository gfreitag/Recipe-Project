Title: Tortilla Dough/Corn Tortillas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Breads
Yield: 5 servings
MMMMM-----------------HOW TO MAKE TORTILLA DOUGH----------------------
To test whether done,
-squeeze a corn kernel
-between your fingers;
If done, the outer skin
-should peel off.  Remove
-from heat and leave
To cool.  Rub the kernels
-together to remove skin
-and place in a
Separate container.  Grind
-in a metate or mill.  To
-avoid lumps
Forming during grinding,
-add a little water.
-(Cornmeal for making
Tortillas is obtainable as
-masa harina.)
Corn prepared for grinding
-and being made into dough
-is called
Nixtamal and is made in the
-following way.  Add 2 oz.
-unslaked lime to
2 lb Corn kernels and boil in 4
-quarts water over a high
-heat. As the
Water is absorbed, stir to
-ensure that the corn cooks
-through
Completely. If all the
-water is used up, add more
-boiling water (do
Not add cold water or the
-corn will take more time
-to cook).

-or, failing
That, a frying pan.
To make tortillas, you need
-a clay or metal griddle
If the dough has been resting for some time, you will have to knead it
again to make it smooth and pliable.  Form small balls of dough that
fit into the palm of your hand, pat each one between your palms,
moving it from one to the other until it forms a very thin pancake.
If the dough tears, patch the break and stick it down with moistened
fingers. Cook on the griddle turning once.  When ready, the tortillas
should puff up, although this is not always so.  To check if done,
lift gently; if the tortilla sticks to the griddle, it is not
completely cooked. To keep warm, wrap in a napkin and place in a
chiquihuite, jicara or other container. As the tortillas tend to
sweat, after a few minutes unwrap the napking and separate them to
avoid sticking, then wrap up again. If freshly made tortillas are not
eaten the same day, wrap them in a napkin, then a plastic bag and
place in the refrigerator.  In this way, they can be successfully
reheated. Tortillas need never go to waste. If you wish, place them
in the sun immediately to dry and put in a paper bag.  They can then
be used later for making tortilla crumbs, chilaquiles, tostadas or
other dishes. Tortillas vary considerably in size but are generally
preferred small and very thin for making tacos. In Oaxaca, tortillas
are much bigger ++ as much as 6, 12 or 15 inches in diameter ++ and
are, incredibly, made by and in the same way. Tortillas can be soft
or crisp; the dough used is the same but the method of cooking is
different. To make crisp tortillas, instead of a griddle, a deep
bottomless (??) pot with sloping sides is used to receive the heat
directly.  The tortillas are slapped on the outside of the pot and
turned once.  [I read this as you cook the tortillas on the bottom of
an iron pot turned upside down.] Recipe from "Traditional Mexican
Cooking" (sub: and its best recipes) By Adela Fernandez (Cookbook
purchased in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico)
