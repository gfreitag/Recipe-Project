2 ts Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 tb Red Pepper Flakes
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
3/4 lb Mozzarella, shredded
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Basil, fresh
Proof yeast in 1/4 cup warm water with 1 teaspoon sugar.  Mix
remaining ingredients (except water), add yeast mixture.  Then add
warm water until the mixture forms a soft ball.  Knead.  Allow dough
to rise until doubled. Place on greased pizza pan.

Marninate mozzarella in olive oil for an hour or more.  Mix in basil

with parmesan cheese.

Bake in preheated 400 degree oven until golden and cooked through,
about 20-25 minutes.

Cut and serve.  Serves 4 as a main dish, or serves 8-12 as appetizer,
cut into bite sized pieces (2" squares).

(I also like to occassionally top with mushrooms and reconstituted
sun-dried tomatoes.)
