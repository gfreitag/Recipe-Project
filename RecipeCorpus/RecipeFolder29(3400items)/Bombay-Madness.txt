Steaks: =======

Remove the steaks from your refrigerator at least 1 hour before
cooking. (Steaks should be at room temperature before you cook them.)
Press a generous amount of white pepper into the surfaces of the
steaks. Cover.

To prepare the steamer, place the lemon grass and water in the
bottom of the steamer with ginger and peppercorns.  Boil 1-2 minutes
to release the oils and flavors of the aromatics.  When ready to cook
the meat, salt the steaks and steam them over vigorously boiling
liquid for 3 minutes ONLY.

Curry Butter: =============

Blend all of the ingredients in a food processor until smooth.

Accompaniments and Garnishes: =============================

For the pickled onions, use sweet onions if possible.  Peel and
trim top and bottom.  Slice thinly, place in a stainless bowl, salt
heavily, and toss.  Leave for 1 hour and drain thoroughly.  Bring 1
cup of vinegar to a boil and pour it over the drained onions.
Reserve.

For the cucumbers in yogurt and creme fraiche, slice 2 small
cucumbers thinly, salt, and allow to set for one hour.  Drain
thoroughly, pressing gently to expel water.  Mix 1.4 cup plain yogurt
and 1./2 cup creme fraiche.  Add a dash of chili powder and mix with
the cucumbers. Chill.

For the mint chutney, see any Indian cookbook.

Other garnish should balance Western color and freshness with the
Indian flavors.  Possibilities include blanched carrots, green beans,
zucchini, and okra.

To Assemble: ============

To serve, arrange accompaniments around the outside of a heated
plate, place a filet in the center, and top with a dab of curry
butter. Serve immediately.
