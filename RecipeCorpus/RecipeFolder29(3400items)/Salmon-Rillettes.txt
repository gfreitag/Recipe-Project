For Court Bouillon: ===================

Place water, onion, carrot, celery, leek, fennel, thyme, dill,
salt and 4 peppercorns in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Cover and
simmer for 25 minutes.  Strain, reserving the liquid.

Bring the strained liquid to a boil in a skillet.  Add the
salmon and lower the heat to simmer.  Place a sheet of buttered
parchment paper or aluminum foil, buttered side down, over the
salmon.  Poach until the fish is just opaque in the center, (about 8
minutes), or about 10 minutes per inch of thickness; DO NOT OVERCOOK.
Remove from the heat and cool salmon completely in broth.

To make up a seasoning mixture, use a small spice or coffee mill
to grind the sea salt, 1/2 teaspoon peppercorns and chili.

Drain the poached salmon, remove its skin, and cut it into
1/2-inch pieces.  Place the salmon pieces, butter, Armagnac and a
pinch of the seasoning mixture into a processor and blend it all into
a very smooth puree.  Add the shredded smoked salmon to the processor
and process with rapid on and off pulses just until the mixture is
blended. There should be visible shreds of smoked salmon.  Transfer
the mixture to a mixing bowl.

Gently fold salmon roe into the mixture until blended, taking
care not to crush the eggs.  Adjust the seasoning.  Spoon mixture
into a 4-cup souffle dish, straight-sided gratin dish, or casserole,
lightly tapping mold on towel lined work surface to eliminate any air
bubbles. Cover the dish with a plastic wrap and chill.  (The Court
Bouillon can be prepared 1 or 2 days ahead.)

For Toast Strips: =================

Preheat oven to 325 F. Rub a baking sheet with a thin film of
olive oil.  Arrange the bread strips on the baking sheet and bake
them on the center rack of the oven, without turning, until lightly
golden (15 to 20 minutes.)

Remove the rillettes from the refrigerator 20 minutes before
serving. Dip the serving spoon in cold water and scoop onto cool
plates. Serve with warm toast strips.
