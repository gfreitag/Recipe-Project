Title: Napa Kimchee
Categories: Relishes, Vegetables, Salads, Asian, Hot/spicy
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Garlic, finely chopped
2 tb Candied ginger
2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Korean red pepper flakes
1 tb Salt
6 lb Napa cabbage
1/4 c  Korean pickling salt
- or kosher salt
8    Scallions, finely chopped
1 1/2 c  Shredded carrot
2 tb Grated fresh ginger
Remove limp outer leaves from the cabbage.  Quarter the cabbage
lengthwise, then cut across the quarters into 1 1/2 inch wide pieces.
Put the cabbage in a very large bowl and add the pickling salt.  Toss
so that the salt coats the cabbage evenly.  Allow to stand for 30
minutes. Toss the cabbage a couple of times during that time.  Rinse
the cabbage with cold water and drain.  Toss with the remaining
ingredients and pack into a large crock or covered pottery casserole.
Add water to cover, about 3 cups. Allow to sit on the counter for 1
to 2 days. Store in the refrigerator, covered, in the crock or in
individual glass jars.

Serve as a relish with any Korean dinner or use in cooking meat or
soup dishes.

Discussion by Jeff Smith:  So many crazy stories have been told about
Kimchee that many Americans are reluctant to try the dish.  No, it is
not buried in the ground in this country, and yes, it is delicious
and much milder than you would expect.  You can vary the spiciness by
varying the amount of red pepper that you put into the dish.
Wonderful stuff!

This recipe can be easily adjusted for 2 pound head of Napa Cabbage.
Divide the remaining ingredients by one third.
