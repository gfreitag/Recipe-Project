2 tb Butter; cut into 1/4 inch
;pieces
2 sm Potato; baking, peeled and
;sliced 1/16 inch thick
2 c  Iranian rice; or other long

1/2 ts Saffron threads
1 pn Sugar
1 ts Warm water
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole equipped with a tightly fitting
lid, bring 6 cups of water to a boil over high heat.  Pour in the
rice is a slow, thin stream so the water does not stop boiling.  Stir
once or twice, boil briskly for 5 minute, then drain in a sieve.
Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle or the back of a spoon, mash the
saffron and sugar together to a powder.  Stir in the 1 teaspoon of
warm water, then pour it into the casserole and stir in the 5
tablespoons of melted butter.  Add the potatoes and turn them about
with a spoon until they are thoroughly coated.  Spread the potatoes
out flat so that they cover the entire bottom of the casserole and
spoon the rice over them, mounding it slightly in the center.  Dot
the top of the rice with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Cover
tightly and cook over high heat for 5 minutes.  Then place a sheet of
aluminum foil over the casserole to seal it completely and set the
lid back in place. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible point and
steam the rice and potatoes for 45 minutes, or until tender.
To serve, spoon the rice in a mound on a heated serving platter.
With a wide metal spatula, gently lift out the potato slices and
arrange them browned side up on the rice.  Chelo seebzamini is
traditionally served with a khoresh or stew, such as fensenjan,
gormeh sabzi or khoresh karafs. Or it may be served like chelo with
butter, raw egg yolk, salt pepper and a little dried sumak.
