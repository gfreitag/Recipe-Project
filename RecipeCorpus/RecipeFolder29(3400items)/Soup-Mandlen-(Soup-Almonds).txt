SOUP MANDLEN (SOUP ALMONDS)
Beat the eggs slightly, adding oil and salt while beating. Stir them
into the flour gradually until you have made a dough stiff enough to
handle. Form the dough into thin rolls on a floured board or between
the palms of both hands. Slice the rolls into  1/2 inch pieces (1
cm). Either deep fry or bake on a baking sheet in a moderate oven
(gas 5, 190C, 375F) for 5-10 minutes until nicely browned. Shake the
pan or stir occasinally to brown them evenly on all sides. Switch off
the oven, leaving the baking tray inside, for the "mandlen" to dry.
Serve as croutons in soup.
