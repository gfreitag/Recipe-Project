Title: Hot and Sour Soup II
Categories: Appetizers, Soup/stew, Chinese, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 c  Cold water
2 tb Arrowroot
1/2 ts Toasted sesame oil
Slivered green onions
4 c  Boiling vegetable broth
1 oz Dried shiitake mushrooms
4 c  Water
1/2 lb Chinese firm tofu
Soy sauce
1/4 c  Apple cider vinegar
Bring 4 cups of vegetable broth to a boil.  Turn off heat and add
dried mushrooms.  Cover and allow to soak about 20 minutes.  Drain
mushroom soaking water into a large pot and add 4 cups of water. Turn
on heat to bring liquid to a boil.  As liquid is heating, cut stems
off mushrooms and cut mushrooms into very thin slivers.

Cut tofu into very thin matchstick slivers and pour a little soy
sauce on top of them.  When liquid comes to a boil, reduce heat to
medium, add slivered mushrooms and allow to  simmer about 10 minutes.
Then add slivered tofu and simmer another 5 minutes.  Add next 3
ingredients and, in a little cup, quickly dissolve arrowroot in the
cold water. Add to ingredients in pot and stir constantly till the
arrowroot thickens. (As the soup thickens, it will become clear
again. It should take only 20 to 30 seconds after liquid comes to a
boil for the arrowroot to thoroughly thicken.) Cover and turn off
heat. Add sesame oil. The soup should be served immediately, topped
with slivered green onions. Makes eight 1 cup servings.
