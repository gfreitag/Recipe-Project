Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Seasoned salt
1 ts Pepper
Water
1/4 c  Self-rising flour
3    To 4 lb. boneless rump or
-eye-of-round roast
1 1/2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Garlic powder
"Cooking until very tender to us means fall-apart tender."

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Rub roast with Worcestershire sauce and
soy sauce; rub next 3 ingredients into meat. Wrap roast tightly in a
double thickness of aluminum foil or in heavy-duty aluminum foil and
place in a roasting pan. Bake for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until meat is
very tender. Carefully unwrap roast, pouring drippings into baking
dish. Place roast on a serving platter; keep warm.

Measure drippings; add water to make 3 cups.  Pour into a saucepan,
add flour, and whisk until smooth.  Cook over medium heat until thick
and smooth, whisking constantly. Serve with the roast and mashed or
boiled new potatoes.
