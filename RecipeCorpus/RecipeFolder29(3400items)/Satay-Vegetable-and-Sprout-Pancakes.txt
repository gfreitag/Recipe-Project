To prepare the pancakes sift the flour and baking powder into a large
bowl. Make a well in the centre. Combine the egg, milk and oil and
stir into the flour. Mix until a smooth batter is formed, then pour
into a jug.

Brush a heated pancake tin with oil. Pour in enough of the batter to
thinly cover the base of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the
mixture sets. Turn over using a metal spatula and cook for a further
1-2 minutes.

Remove and place on a plate and cover with a square of greaseproof
paper. Continue until all the batter has been used. Keep the pancakes
warm.

To make the filling combine the prepared vegetables and divide evenly
between the pancakes. Garnish the pancakes with the extra peanuts.
Fold over or roll up and place on a large platter.

To make the dressing combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and
whisk well. Pour over the pancakes before serving.
