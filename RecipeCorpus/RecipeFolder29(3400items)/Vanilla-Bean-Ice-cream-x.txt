1 1/2 c  Sugar
A pinch of salt
2 c  Cream
3 1/4 c  Milk
3    Whole vanilla beans (or 2
-1/2 teaspoons vanilla
-extract)
Heat the milk in a saucepan until almost boiling then remove the pan
from the heat and infuse the vanilla beans in the milk for 30
minutes. With a sharp knife, cut the vanilla beans vertically in half
and carefully scrape all the seeds into the milk. Toss in the vanilla
pods and return the milk to a simmer.

Beat the egg yolks with the sugar in a bowl until light and fluffy.
Discard the vanilla pods and stir half the hot milk into the yolk
mixture, then stir all the yolk mixture back into the remaining milk.
Add the salt and cook over low heat until the mixture thickens
slightly and coats the back of a spoon. Remove the mixture
immediately from the heat and pour into a bowl to cool.

Add the cream and chill the mixture in the refrigerator. Freeze in an
ice-cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions, then
spoon into a covered container and store in the freezer until
required.
