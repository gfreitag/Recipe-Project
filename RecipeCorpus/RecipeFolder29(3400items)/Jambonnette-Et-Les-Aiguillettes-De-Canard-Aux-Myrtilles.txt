the veal and pork.  Puree a few seconds and add egg (2 eggs if they

Stir and simmer for 5 minutes and add blueberries.

Heat oil and brown reserved breasts, skin side first.

Remove from pan, cut off skin, and brown the breast again.

Slice the browned breasts into strips and serve with the stuffed
legs and sauce.
