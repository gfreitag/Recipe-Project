For Pasta: ==========

In a mixer with a dough hook, or a processor, combine the flour,
eggs and oil, adding water as needed to form a soft ball.  Transfer
to a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes.
Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.

For Filling: ============

Halve the squash and remove all of its seeds and strings.  Cut
the squash up into large wedges and cook, covered, in boiling salted
water until tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain completely and cool
briefly. Scoop out the flesh.  (You should have about 2 cups.)

Place the escarole in a saucepan with about 1 cup of water;
cover. Steam the escarole, tossing once or twice, just until wilted,
3 to 5 minutes.  Drain in a colander, rinse with cold water, squeeze
dry and chop coarsely.  Set aside.

Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over
medium-high heat.  Add squash and cook, stirring, until dry, about 5
minutes, breaking up the flesh coarsely as it cooks.  Add Parmesan
cheese and parsley, lower heat to medium and stir for 3 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and stir in the escarole,
ham, ricotta and egg.  Season with black pepper, nutmeg and a little
salt, if desired.  Set aside.

To Assemble: ============

Cut the dough into 3 pieces.  Roll each piece with a heavy
rolling pin on a lightly floured board (or use a pasta machine) until
it's 1/8-inch thick.  (You should be able to see your fingers through
the dough.)

Use a 4-inch cutter to cut out rounds of dough; place them on a
lightly floured baking sheet.  Place about 1 1/2 teaspoons squash
filling on lower half of each round, leaving a border.  Fold top half
of each round over filling and press edges together to seal.  Warp
edges of each half-circle around your index finger, bringing ends
together to overlap by about 1/4 inch.  Pinch edges to seal.

For Sauce: ==========

Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a heavy saucepan.  Add cream and a
generous amount of white pepper, whisking over medium-high heat.
Stir in the pecorino cheese (in a pinch, you could probably get away
with Parmesan, but it won't taste the same) and tomato sauce.  Boil
gently 3 to 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook tortelloni in a large pot of boiling salted water
until they float to the surface, then boil 1 minute longer; drain.
Place the tortelloni in heated serving bowls, nap with sauce and serve
immediately, with additional Parmesan and white pepper.
