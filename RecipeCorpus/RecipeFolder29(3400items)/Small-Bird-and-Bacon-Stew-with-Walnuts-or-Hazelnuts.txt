Title: Small Bird and Bacon Stew with Walnuts or Hazelnuts
Categories: Game, Main dish, Medieval, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
-roughly chopped
1 1/4 c  Real ale
3/4 c  Water
3    Or 4 bay leaves
x  Little salt and freshly
-ground black pepper
6    Coarse slices brown bread
6    Fatty rashers of bacon,
-chopped roughly
4    Pigeons or other small game
-birds (6 if very small)
8 oz Mushrooms, whatever variety,
-chopped roughly
3 oz Roasted Hazelnuts or walnuts
Fry the bacon, with the garlic, till it is lightly browned in a heavy
bottomed casserole.  Add birds and brown on all sldes.  Add the
mushrooms and nuts, continue to cook for a couple of minutes, then
add the ale and water with the bay leaves.  Bring to the boil, cover
and simmer very gently for 2 to 2 1/2 hours -- the birds should be
falling off the bone. Remove the birds from the juices, cool juices
completely and remove any excess fat.  The birds can be served whole
on or off the bone.  If the latter, carve them while they are cold
then return to the skimmed juices and reheat gently.  Adjust the
seasoning to taste and serve either the whole birds or the slices on
the pieces of bread, with plenty of the juices and "bits".  A good
green salad to follow is the best accompaniment.
