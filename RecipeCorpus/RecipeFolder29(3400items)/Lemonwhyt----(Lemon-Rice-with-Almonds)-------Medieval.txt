Categories: Medieval, Rice, Side dish
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Butter
2/3 c  Coarsely ground almonds
2/3 c  Currants

:1. Finely grate the skin from the lemon. Then cut the lemon,
thoroughly squeezing and removing most of the pulp. Reserve the skin,
juice, and soft pulp, discarding the membranes and pits.

:2. In a large enameled pot bring to a brisk boil the water, rice,
salt, cinnamon, butter, and lemon, reducing heat to simmer until most
fluid is absorbed (about 10 minutes). Stir once or twice while
simmering; otherwise keep pot tightly covered. Remove covered pot
from heat.

:3. Slowly simmer the almonds and currants in white wine for 7
minutes.

:4. Fluff rice gently with a fork. Add the wined almonds to the lemon
rice.

:5. Stir in fresh peas. Very slowly simmer for 5 to 7 minutes. If the
rice begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, add small amounts of
boiling water.

:6. Garnish with 1 teaspoon honey for each portion.
