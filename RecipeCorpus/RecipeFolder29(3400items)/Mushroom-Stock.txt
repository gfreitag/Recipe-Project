Title: Mushroom Stock
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 7 cups
1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
2 sm Carrots, sliced
6    Sprigs parsley, chopped
3    Sprigs thyme
2    Sprigs marjoram or oregano
3    Sage leaves
2    Bay leaves
9 c  Cold water
1    Yellow onion
-thinly sliced
1    Leek top
-washed and chopped
4    Garlic clove(s)
-in skins, crushed
1 oz Dried shiitake mushrooms
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black peppercorns
In a stockpot, combine onion, leek top, garlic and salt with just
enough water to start the vegetables cooking, about  cup. Stir the
vegetables, cover the pot, and cook gently over medium heat until the
vegetables are wilted and tender, about 15 minutes. Add the remaining
ingredients (including the tomatoes if you're using them), bring to a
boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 1 hour. Pour the stock
through a strainer, pressing as much liquid as possible from the
vegetables before discarding them.

Note: for a lighter-tasting stock with a more complex flavor, add 1
lbs coarsely chopped tomatoes or one 28-oz can tomatoes.
