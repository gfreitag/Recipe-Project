the fat side almost to the bone.  Spoon about 1/4 of the stuffing
into each pocket. If necessary, securely fasten the opening with
toothpicks. For glaze, in a small saucepan combine jelly and jalepeno
pepper. Cook and stir over low heat till jelly melts. Combine apple
juice and cornstarch; stir into jelly mixture.  Cook and stir until
thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 2 minutes more. Preheat gas

juices run clear, turning once halfway through and brushing with
glaze after 25 minutes.  409 calories and 18 grams fat. Source: BH &
