Title: Sweet and Sour Cider Raisin Sauce for Tongue and Ham
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Meats
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
1/4 c  Raisins
8    Whole cloves
2    Inches cinnamon stick
1 tb Butter, optional
1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 c  Vinegar
1 c  Apple cider
Put the cloves and cinnamon in a cheese cloth and simmer the spices
in the vinegar and cider for 30 min. [Don't use powdered spices; they
cloud the sauce and alter its flavor]. Remove the spice bag and
reserve the cider. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, starch and salt.
Stir in the spiced cider and add the raisins. Stir while the sauce
thickens and add the butter, if you wish, at the last minute. Serve
hot over sliced tongue or ham.

Optional ingredients: currants in lieu of raisins
grated lemon rind.
