To the saute pan, add 1 bunch of coriander (tied together), all
of the clams, and the grilled tomatoes.  Turn the heat up to high and
bring to a boil.

Add 2 cups of heated fish stock, cover, and steam to open the
clams (about 5 minutes).  Replenish fish stock as needed to keep
ingredients covered.

Add the angler fish, lime juice (to taste), and chilies.  If
necessary, add more coriander and roasted garlic.  Continue cooking
for 2 minutes, then bring to a rolling boil and add mussels.

(Note: Mussels open quickly.)

Add the remainder of the fish (tuna or cod), then lobster,
shrimp, oysters, and squid.  (Note: All fish should have the skin
removed and be cut into 1-inch cubes.)

Remove tied bunch of coriander, then cook covered for 2-3
minutes and serve.

Garnish with fresh coriander.
