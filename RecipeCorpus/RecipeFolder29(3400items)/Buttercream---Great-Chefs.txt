Title: Buttercream - Great Chefs
Categories: Basics, Cake/cookie, Masterchefs
Yield: 16 servings
1/2 c  Water
1/2 lb Butter, sweet
4 lg Egg yolks
1 3/4 c  Sugar
Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat,
stirring to dissolve.  Wash down the sides of the pan with a damp
brush and cook the syrup to 238 F without stirring.

Begin to beat the egg yolks in a mixer.  When the syrup reaches the
correct temperature, turn the mixer to high and add the syrup slowly
to the eggs.  Continue to beat until the mixture has cooled.

Add the butter, bit by bit, to the yolk-sugar mixture and beat
until fluffy.  (The butter should be at a creamy consistency before
adding to the mixture.  If necessary, beat the butter to soften it
first.)
