On better days, mash stew, shape into patties, attain proper
consistency by adding liquid, or wheat germ and dry milk.  Coat
patties with wheat germ. Brown in hot oil, 5 minutes per side.  Tuck
one patty in each pita, add "fixings" and pass the catsup!

Kids love this supper.  It's nutritious, inexpensive and meatless.
