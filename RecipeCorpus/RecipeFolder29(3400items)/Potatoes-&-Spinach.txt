Wash the spinach thoroughly and put inot a large saucepan with only
the water clinging to the leaves. Cook gently over a moderate heat
until the spinach has wilted. Remove from the heat and drain in a
colander, pressing out as much of the liquid as possible. Chop
roughly. Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat. When
hot, add the mustard seeds. As soon as they begin to pop, add the
onion and garlic. Stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the potatoes, cayenne
pepper and coriander. Stir-fry for a further 2 minutes. Add the
spinach, salt and water. Bring to a boil. Cover tightly, reduce the
heat to very low and cook gently for 35 minutes, until the potatoes
are tender, stirring occasionally and making sure there is always
some liquid in the pan. When the potatoes are tender, remove from the
heat, turn into a warmed serving dish and serve immediately. Source:
