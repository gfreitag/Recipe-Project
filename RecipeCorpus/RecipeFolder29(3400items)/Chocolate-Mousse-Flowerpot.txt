For Creme Anglaise: ===================

Bring milk and cream to boil in heavy saucepan.

Meanwhile, beat egg yolks and sugar in mixer,until pale yellow
and forms a ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 7 minutes.

Slowly pour 1 cup of hot liquid into yolks, beating constantly.

Transfer yolk mixture to milk and cream in saucepan and stir
constantly over medium-low heat until it thickens enough to coat the
back of a spoon.  DO NOT BOIL.

Strain into a large bowl set into a larger bowl of ice water and
cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.  Cover and
refrigerate for at least two hours.

For Mousse: ===========

Heat sugar and water in heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until
sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally and brushing down any crystals
from sides 2of pan with brush dipped in cold water.  Increase heat
and boil until mixture registers 240 F (soft ball stage) on a candy
thermometer.

Meanwhile, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks
form.

Slowly pour in hot syrup, beating until mixture is cool, about 5
minutes

Gently fold in whipped cream, cocoa, melted chocolate and
espresso.

Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

For Chocolate Flowers: ======================

Line a jelly roll pan with waxed paper.  Melt chocolate with corn
syrup, stirring until smooth.  Pour into prepared pan and spread with
metal spatula to thickness of 1/4 inch.  Cool to room temperature.

Transfer paper with chocolate to work surface.  Place second
sheet of waxed paper over chocolate.  Roll chocolate to 1/8 inch
thickness. Cut into twenty 1-inch rounds with a cookie cutter.  Roll
1 chocolate round into tight funnel shape for center of flower.
Gather 3 more rounds around center, forming petals.  Squeeze together
at base. Place on a waxed paper-lined plate.  Repeat with remaining
chocolate, forming 5 flowers. Refrigerate until flowers are firm.

To Assemble: ============

Divide creme anglaise among five 2 cup cachepots or other
porcelain dishes shaped like a flowerpot.  Top with chocolate mousse,
mounding slightly in center.  Set chocolate flower atop each (to
anchor flowers more securely, place on lollipop sticks, then insert
in mousse.)

Refrigerate until 20 minutes before serving.

Each flowerpot makes two servings.
