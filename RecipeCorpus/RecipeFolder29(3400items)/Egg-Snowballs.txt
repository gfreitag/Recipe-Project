Yield: 4 servings
1 x  Creme Anglaise **
MMMMM-------------------------QUENELLES------------------------------
1 qt Water OR
1 qt Milk
10 lg Egg whites
1 ea Bean, vanilla
2 oz Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
5 tb Water

** See recipe for Creme Anglaise.

In a large bowl, whip the egg whites until they are very stiff.
Add the vanilla bean paste.  Add sugar (amount of sugar varies - it
has to bind the eggs).

In a large saucepan, heat (but do NOT boil) milk or water.

Shape the beaten egg whites into quenelles and float them in the
liquid to poach gently.  After 2 minutes, turn the egg puffs with a
spoon dipped in cold water.  Cook for 3 more minutes, then remove to
a baking pan. Drain the pan, and briefly reserve the quenelles.

Boil the sugar and water in a saucepan until it forms caramel.

Scoop Creme Anglaise into the bottoms of your serving bowls and
then place a quenelle in each bowl.  Sprinkle with roasted almonds
and top with caramel sauce.  Garnish with fresh fruit of the season.
