extract. Stir in half of the sifted mixture, 1 cup pecans, then the
remaining sifted mixture.

remaining pecans on top of the crescents.

Bake the cookies for about 13 to 15 minutes, or until set.  The
undersides should be a very pale golden color.  After 1 minute,

dredge them in the confectioners' sugar. Cool completely.
