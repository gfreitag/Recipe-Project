Categories: Seafood, Kids, Main dish
Yield: 3 servings
2    Eggs;
1/4 c  Butter -=RO=-
1/4 c  Margarine;
1 lb Codfish; -=OR=-
1 lb Snapper
3/4 c  Bread crumbs;
Wash the fillets, then pat them dry with pepper towels.  Have a
grown-up assistant cut them into long pieces.  Preheat oven to 400 F.
Spread the bread crumbs on wax paper.  Break eggs into a bowl and
beat them with a fork.  Dip each strip on fish in to eggs, then roll
it around on the bread crumbs until  it's coated.  Then lay each
strip of fish out on the baking pan.  Melt the butter in a small pan
over low-heat and have a grown-up assistant pour little over each of
the fish sticks. Bake until fish sticks are golden brown (about 15
minutes). Source: The San Diego Union-Tribune, Food Section, Mar. 24,
