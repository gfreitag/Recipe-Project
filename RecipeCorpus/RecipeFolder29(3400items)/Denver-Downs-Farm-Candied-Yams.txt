Title: Denver Downs Farm Candied Yams
Categories: Countyfairs, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/2    Orange, Thinly Sliced
-Crosswise
3 tb Butter
2 lg (To 3) Yams Or Sweet
-Potatoes
1 tb Baking Soda
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
1. Peel the yams. Slice or cut them into 1/4-inch strips. Put them in
a bowl and cover with warm water; add the soda. Let stand 10 mins,
then drain.

2. Meanwhile, combine the sugar, water, salt and orange slices in a
heavy saucepan and heat until sugar is dissolved. Add the yams and
cook, uncovered, over moderate heat until the syrup thickens and
potatoes are tender. This will take about 1 hour. Stir very gently
from time to time. (At this point, you can stop and refrigreate them
for later use. If you chose to do this, then 30 mins before serving
you should gently reheat them and proceed with step 3.)

3. Just before serving, add the butter and stir the yams gently until
the butter is melted and the yams are warmed.
