Dorothy's note: A collection of recipes tested in the kitchen of Jo
Parodi in a cookbook created with love for her family and friends. A
colleague has allowed me to borrow his mother's present to him, and
lucky for us, Mrs. Parodi has given her permission for me to post
some of the family recipes from her 1973 cookbook. From: Dorothy Hair
