Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Nuts/grains, Medieval
Yield: 6 servings
x  Honey or brown sugar to
-taste
3 oz Toasted hazelnuts
3 oz Wholemeal or wholewheat
-breadcrumbs
2 1/2 lb Mixed soft summer fruits--

....A baked dessert like this would have been sunk in the embers of
the log fire with a cauldron or pot upturned over it to form a lid....

DIRECTIONS:

Put the fruits in a pan or microwave dish with about 1-inch water in
the bottom and cook gently for 10-15 minutes (4-6 minutes in the
microwave), or until the fruits are soft without being totallymushy.
Sweeten to taste with the honey or brown sugar (Saxons would have
used honey); how much you need will depend on what fruits you have
used.  Drain the excess juice and save to serve with the pudding.
Chop the hazelnuts in a processor or liquidiser until they are almost
as fine as the breadcrumbs, but not quite, then mix the two together.
Spoon the fruit into an ovenproof dish and cover with a thick layer
of hazelnuts and crumbs.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees F) for
20-30 minutes or until the top os slightly crunchy and browned.
Serve with lots of cream or plain yogurt and warmed fruit juices.
