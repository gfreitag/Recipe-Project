For Roast Duck: ===============

Preheat the oven to 400 F. Rub some soy sauce, salt and pepper
into the cavity of the duck and place the duck on a rack in the
roasting pan. Stir together the honey and the vinegar and brush some
over the duck. Roast the duck until crisp and golden, about 1 hour,
occasionally brushing with honey-vinegar mixture.  Cool.

With a sharp knife, remove the skin from each side of the breast
and cut into thin slivers.  Remove the meat from each side of the
breast and cut it into thin slivers.  Combine the slivers of skin and
the slivers of duck, reserve 1 cup.  The remainder of the duck can be
saved for another use.

For Dressing: =============

In a small bowl, blend together the dressing ingredients and set
aside.

In a wok or wide casserole, heat 2 inches of vegetable oil over
high heat to 450 F. Carefully, add mai fun noodles, in a few seconds
they will puff.  Turn carefully with a skimmer and cook the other
side. Remove the noodles and drain on paper towels.

Break up the noodles and arrange them on 4 chilled serving
plates. Scatter shredded lettuce over the noodles and top with the
reserved duck. Garnish with scallions and cilantro.  Stir dressing
and drizzle a small amount over each salad.  Sprinkle with sesame
seeds and serve, passing remaining dressing separately.
