THE ROTHSCHILD OF KUGELS

I found the following recipe handwritten on a piece of paper in a book
bought at `Ort' charity shop. It is a deliciuos and wonderfully rich
kugel.

Crumble the cheese into a large mixing bowl, add all the rest of the
ingredients, including the the marinating brandy, except for the
separated eggs and the sugar. Beat the egg yolks and sugar until
thick and lemon colored. Fold into the mixture. Beat the egg whites
to a stuff snow and fold gently into the mix. Turn into an oiled
round 9 1/2 inches (24 cm) baking tin. Stand the tin in a pan of hot
water before baking in a moderate oven (gas 4, 180C, 350F) for 1 hour
or until set. Serve hot or cold.

* Personal Note from S.S.Mein Kind. *********************************
For those of you who don't use liquor, you can substitute pineapple
juice or syrup flavored with almond extract for the rum. For the
brandy you could use apple cider, peach or apricot syrup.
