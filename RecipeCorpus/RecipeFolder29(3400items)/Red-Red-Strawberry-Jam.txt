Title: Red Red Strawberry Jam
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
Juice of 1/2 lemon, opt'l
1 qt Perfect strawberries
4 c  Sugar
Wash, dry and stem the berries. Put them in a 10" deep heavy pot,
cutting a few berries to release some juice. Cover them with the
sugar. Stir the mixture very gently with a wooden spoon over low heat
until it has "juiced up". Then raise heat to med and stop stirring.
As soon as it bubbles up, time for 15 min. and cook without stirring.
After 15 min remove from heat and allow to cool uncovered. Sprinkle
surface with lemon juice if you wish. When cool, stir lightly and put
into sterilized jars. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   04-09-95
