Categories: Chili
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Monterey Jack Cheese --
Coarsely shredded
1    Recipe Favorite Chili
12    Leaves Phyllo
6 tb Unsalted Butter -- melted
MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
Green Olives, Sliced
Jalapeno Peppers, Chopped
Tomato Wedges
Black Olives
1. Prepare chili as directed and chill.

2. Preheat oven to 400 F. Grease a 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch jelly roll
pan.

3. place 1 leaf of phyllo on a towel with the long edge in front of
you, and brush lightly with melted butter. Place a second leaf on
top, and brush again with butter. Top with a third leaf (do not brush
with butter), and cut the stack in half crosswise.

4. Spoon about 3/4 cup chili along the near edge of each phyllo stack,
leaving about 1-inch border uncovered on each side.

5. Holding the towel corners nearest you, flip the towel up, causing
the phyllo to roll over on itself and cover the filling. (you can do
both stacks with one flip.) Turn the edges in over the filling and
continue to roll 1 strudel at a time to the end. Carefully place each
strudel on the greased pan, seam side down. Repeat 3 more times with
the remaining chili and phyllo. Brush the strudel tops with melted
butter, place the pan in the middle of the preheated oven, and bake
for 12 to 14 mins, until the strudels are crisp and golden brown.

6. If you have an attractive oven-safe serving platter, transfer the
strudels to it, and sprinkle the cheese on top. (Otherwise, leave the
strudels in the pan.) Return the strudels to the oven until the cheese
melts, about 3 mins. Remove pan from oven, garnish the strudels, and
serve 1 strudel to each guest, placing some olives, onions, peppers
and tomatoes on each plate.
