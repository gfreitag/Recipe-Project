Categories: English, Medieval, Salsa/sauce, Poultry
Yield: 2 cups+

1 cl To 2 cloves garlic
2 c  Milk
2 tb Flour
"Sauce Gauncile" from "Two Fifteenth-century Cookery Books"

"Thicken the milk with the flour and butter and cook, stirring, until
creamy. Squeeze the garlic into the milk through a garlic press and
season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes and spoon over the
carved pieces of the bird.
"The addition of a pinch of saffron transforms this into another
medieval sauce called 'gauncile', which was served with boiled or
roast pork."
