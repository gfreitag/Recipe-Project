Wash eight dozen ripe tomatoes, place them in an earthen pan, having
divided them in one or two pieces, carefully removing any stalk that
may adhere, or any blackened or decayed part; over each layer strew
some salt, and let them stand for two days; put them in a preserving
pan with the liquor, and boil well for fifteen minutes; then pass the
pulp through a colander or coarse sieve to separate the skins from
the pulp; to this strained juice, add 4 oz mustard seed, 2 oz whole
pepper, 1 ripe red pepper, having removed the see; 2 0z whole ginger,
2 oz allspice, several cloves of eschalot; boil all together till the
pulp is reduced to nearly half the quantity, rub it through the
colanderand press it with a spoon; a gill of vinegar to wash the pulp
clean through from the spices, at last, may be added; bottle when
cold, and cork tight down. Those who can afford it, put a teaspoonful
of white wine into each bottle the last thing. Origin:  The Canadian
