Title: Perfect Poached Chicken for Chicken Salad
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 batch
Boiling water
Boneless chicken breasts
Take as many boneless chicken breasts as you need. Let them come to
room temperature. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. With
tongs, place the chicken in the water and remove it the instant the
water stops boiling. Turn the same water up to a full boil again. Put
the chicken back in, turn the heat off, and leave the pot on the
stove, covered, for at least 1 hour.

Note: this method does NOT get the chicken hot enough to kill the
Salmonella bacteria.
