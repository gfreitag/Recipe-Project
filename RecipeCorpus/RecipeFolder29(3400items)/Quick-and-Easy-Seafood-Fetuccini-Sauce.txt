Quick and Easy Seafood Fetuccini Sauce . Seafood Cream Sauce . In a
small sauce pan,  on medium heat,  melt  butter.   When butter is
melted add onions & garlic.  When onions are clear, (if you are using
shrimp add at this point and cook  for  5 minutes before continuing)
add cheese and stir until  melted. When the cheese is melted (if you
are using oysters, add them at this point, oysters need a very short
cooking time, adding 1/2 cup of  the  oyster water, strained  is  an
excellent substitue for the salt), add  sour cream & cook for an
additional 5 minutes. This dish is very quick to prepare,  but
needed  constant attention and stirring. Serve imediately after
cheese sauce is hot for best flavor. This cheese sauce is also
excellent as a crab finger dip, and as all of the ingredients for
excellent restuffed baked potatoes (just add 1 strip of crumbed bacon
for each potatoe and broil the tops until brown).
