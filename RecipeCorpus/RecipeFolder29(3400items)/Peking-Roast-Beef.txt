Title: Peking Roast Beef
Categories: Meats, Chinese, Main dish
Yield: 3 servings
2 c  Strong black coffee
2 c  Water
5 lb Roast
Slivers of onion or garlic
1 c  Vinegar
Using a knife, cut slits completely through the meat; insert the
garlic or onion slivers according to which taste your family prefers.
Place the beef in a bowl and pour vinegar over, making sure it is
poured in the slits also.  Place in the refrigerator for 24 to 48
hours. When you're ready to cook the roast pour off the vinegar and
place in a heavy pot (iron if you have one) and brown in oil until
its very dark on both sides. Pour coffee over the roast, then water
and cover. Cook slowly for 6 hours on the stove top.  If roast is
cooking too fast, add 1 cup of water at a time. Do not season until
20 minutes before serving. Randy Rigg Submitted By RANDY RIGG   On
