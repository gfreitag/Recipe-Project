Title: "Miracle Soup"
Categories: Fatfree, Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1    To 2 carrots, grated
2 pk Lipton onion soup mix
1    Green pepper, chopped
2 lg Tins tomaotes
1 ea Bunch of celery, chopped
2    To 3 onions, chopped
1 lg Cabbage, grated
add to a large stock pot, bring to a boil, add more water if
necessary.

Although slightly bland, it's a good filler, and well, you can see
from the ingredients that you probably will loose weight if you ate
nothing but this {godawful my mother calls it} soup.
