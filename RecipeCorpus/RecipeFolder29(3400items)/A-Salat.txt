Salads, made mainly of herbs, were popular throughout the Middle Ages,
often served at the start of a meal, rather than after the main
course. The make up of the salad would change according to the season
and what grew in the cook's herb garden, so feel free to adapt this
basic recipe as desired.  Do NOT make it with dried herbs!

DIRECTIONS:

Wash the cresses, herbs and fennel, and dry all thoroughly.  Mix them,
with the leek and spring onions, in a laarge bowl, sprinkle with salt
and pepper, and mix again.  Mix the oil with the vinegar and pour
over the salad just before serving.
