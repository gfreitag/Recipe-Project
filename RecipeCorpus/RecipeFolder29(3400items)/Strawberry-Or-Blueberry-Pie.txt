Title: Strawberry Or Blueberry Pie
Categories: Countyfairs, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
OR-
Fresh Blueberries
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Cornstarch
1 c  Whipping Cream
1 pk (3 Oz) Cream Cheese,
Softened
1 tb Milk Or Cream
1    9 Inch Pie Shell, fully
Baked
4 c  Strawberries, Ripe & Hulled
Note from Anne Wickham: If you use blueberries, you can omit the cream
cheese.

1. Mash the cream cheese with the milk until spreadable. Spread it
over the pie shell. Arrange half the strawberries, pointed ends up,
or blueberries, in the pie shell.

2. Place the remaining 2 cups of berries in a saucepan. Add the sugar
and cornstarch, pressed through a sieve. Cook, mashing the fruit with
a wooden spoon, until mixture comes to a boil. It will thicken almost
immediately. Pour while hot over the fruit in pie shell. Cool and
chill in the refrigerator.

3. Whip the cream and pipe or spread it over the pie.
