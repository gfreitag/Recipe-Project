Cinnamon Dough: ===============

Form a large ring of flour on your work surface.  In the center of
the ring of flour make a mound of sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon;
also make a mound of butter cut into small squares.  With the palm of
your hand, cream the butter and add to the sugar mixture while
continuing to cream.

Push the flour into the center and blend with the butter/sugar
mixture into a coarse meal.

Add all the water, press to mix in the water, then work the dough
into a ball with the palms to an equal consistency having no dry
spots.

Roll out one 10-inch tart shell on the floured work surface.  Chill
about half an hour.

Place the shell into a pie pan, or tart pan and mold a piece of
aluminum foil in the pan.  Bake in 350 F preheated oven for 15 - 20
minutes until golden brown.

Apricot Glaze: ==============

Combine jam, sugar and water in a heavy saucepan.  Mix well, bring
to a boil, then simmer until clear.

Peach Filling: ==============

Cut each peach into eight sections and arrange snugly in baked tart
shell.  Lightly brush apricot glaze over all peaches and serve.
