8    Fresh large basil leaves
1 tb Dried tarragon
1 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 pn Cayenne
1 c  Sour cream
1 c  Ripe tomato, seeded and cut

Melt the butter in a heavy large saucepan over low heat.  Add the
onions and garlic and cook uncovered until wilted, about 25 minutes.
Add the stock and heat to boiling.  Trim the woody ends from the
asparagus and cut the stalks into 1" pieces.  Reserve the tips.  Add
the asparagus pieces, parsley, carrots, basil, tarragon, salt, pepper
and cayenne to the stock. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
covered until the vegetables are tender, about 50 minutes.  Remove
the soup from heat and let cool. Process in batches in a blender or
food processor fitted with a stell blade until smooth.  Strain the
soup through a medium-size sieve to remove woody fibers.  Return the
strained soup to the pan, add the asparagus tips, and simmer over
medium heat until the tips are tender, about 10 minutes. Ladle the
soup into soup bowls. Dollop each serving with sour cream and
sprinkle with diced tomato.  From The Silver Palate Good Times
