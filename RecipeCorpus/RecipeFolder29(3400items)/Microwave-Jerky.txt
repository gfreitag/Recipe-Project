Title: Microwave Jerky
Categories: Meats
Yield: 3 servings
1/4 c  Worcestershire Sauce
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
1/4 c  Water
6 ea Drops Liquid Smoke
1/2 lb Trimmed venison *
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 ts Garlic Powder
1 ts Accent
1/4 ts Black Pepper
Cut meat into 1/8" thick strips, which is easier if it is slightly
frozen.
combine ingredients, and place with meat in refrigerator overnight to
marinate.  Then place the meat strips in a microwave roasting rack.
set the microwave on high for 4 to 6 minutes.  after 4 minutes add
time in 30 second increments.  The idea is to have a dried jerky,
which means a color change from brown to dark brown, and a
consistency in the meat that has changed from supple to leathery in
it's texture. That's it!
