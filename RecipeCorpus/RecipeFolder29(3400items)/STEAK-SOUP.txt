Title: STEAK SOUP
Categories: Soup/stew, Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 4 quarts
2 1/2 qt Water
1    8 oz. can chopped tomatoes
1/3 c  Beef stock base
Pepper
1    10 oz. pkg. frozen mixed
Vegetables
1 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Chopped onions
1 1/2 c  Sliced carrots
1 c  Diced celery
1 c  Flour
1 lb Ground beef
Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the onions, carrots and
celery. Saute until the onions are tender, about 15 mins. Add the
flour and stir until well blended and smooth. Cook until mixture
boils around edges, but do not overcook or roux will break down. Set
aside. Crumble the ground beef over a jelly-roll pan and pat into a
layer 1 inch thick. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or
until meat is browned. The color of the beef will determine the color
of the soup. Drain. Break up the meat into 1/2-ich chunks. Add half
of the water to the saucepan containing the vegetables and bring to a
simmer. Add the tomatoes, beef chunks and stock base. Season to taste
with pepper. Cook, stirring, 10 minutes. Add remaining water and
frozen vegetables. Cook 5 minutes longer or until vegetables are
tender. DO NOT BOIL>
