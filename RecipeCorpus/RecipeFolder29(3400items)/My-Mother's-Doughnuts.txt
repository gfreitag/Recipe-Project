Categories: Pastry, Mom's
Yield: 24 servings
3/4 ts Nutmeg, freshly grated
4 tb Butter Or Lard, melted
1/2 ts Fresh Lemon Juice

-Oil, for deep frying
Sugar For Dusting
-if desired
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
1 c  Sugar
4 c  All-Purpose Flour

4 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1 ts Salt
1. In a large bowl, beat eggs until light. Stir in milk and sugar.

2. In another large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda,
salt and nutmeg together.

3. Stir half of the flour into the egg mixture. Add the butter and
lemon juice and mix until combined. Stir in the remaining flour
mixture to make the dough. Cover and chill about 90 mins.

4. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough about 1/2 inch
thick. Cut with a doughnut cutter or cookie cutter into 3-inch
rounds; cut out the centers and either fry them for doughnut holes or
roll again to get a larger yield.

5. In a deep heavy skillet, heat 3 inches of shortening to 365 F on a
deep-frying thermommeter. Fry 3 or 4 doughnuts at a time, turning with
tongs, 2 to 3 mins or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
Replace the shortening as needed. Dust with sugar, if desired.

Note from Barbara says these are delicious dipped in fresh maple
syrup.
