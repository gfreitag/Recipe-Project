Preheat oven to 375 F. Rinse the cauliflower and break into florets.

In a medium-sized saucepan, steam the cauliflower until fork-tender
(do not overcook). In a small saucepan, melt the Velveeta cheese over
low heat, then add the milk and onion and stir until well blended.

In a large casserole, place some of the melted cheese on the bottom
and layer with cauliflower, then cracker crumbs, dot with butter and
margarine, and repeat. Crumble additional cracker crumbs and place on
top.

Cover and bake for 20 mins. Uncover and let stand in the oven for an
additional 5 mins.
