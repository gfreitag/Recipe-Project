Preparation: cut the aubergine and sweet potatoes into chunks

1. Preheat the grill to medium. Place the aubergines and sweet potato
in a large mixing bowl and toss together with the sesame oil and
a little seasoning. Thread onto 12 bamboo skewers (wet the skewers
first; they don't burn then!) and place under the grill for 20
minutes, turning occasionally until tender and golden brown.

2. Meanwhile, make the satay sauce. Heat the creamed coconut, soy
sauce and lemon juice in a small pan. Gradually beat in the
peanut butter and water until well mixed and warmed through.
Season.

3. Transfer the kebabs to serving plates and cover with the satay
sauce.
