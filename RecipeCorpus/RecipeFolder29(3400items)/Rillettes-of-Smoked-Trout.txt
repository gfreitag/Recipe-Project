One day before serving, place the trout, butter, pork fat, garlic,
and wine in a large saucepan.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and
simmer until all the liquid evaporates.  Let stand 20 minutes to
cool. Process the dill in a food processor fitted with a steel blade
until minced. Add the trout mixture and process until well combined.
Add the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste and process until
mixed. Spoon into a crock and refrigerate covered overnight to allow
flavors to blend. Before serving, let warm to room temperature.
