Title: MAMA'S ESCAROLE SOUP
Categories: Soup/stew, Poultry, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1    Potato, peeled, diced (opt)
2 c  Chicken broth
2    Heads of escarole, well
Washed and coarsely cut
2 tb Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1    Onion, chopped
2    Carrots, sliced
In a large saucepan, heat olive oil and gently brown garlic. Add
onion, carrots and if using, the potato (this helps to thicken the
soup as it breaks up), and after 1 minute, the broth. Add escarole,
cover and let come to a boil. Lower to simmer for 1 hour. For more
liquid soup, add a little more broth or water. Its also delicious to
add spareribs and/or a few pieces of Italian sausages before you
brown the vegetables. Make sure the meat is well cooked. Then add
everything else. Serve sprinkled with grated cheese and soft Italian
bread.
