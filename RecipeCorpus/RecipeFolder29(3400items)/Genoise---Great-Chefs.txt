Yield: 16 servings
1/4 lb Butter, sweet
7 oz Flour, cake
8 lg Eggs
1/2 lb Sugar
Preheat oven to 350 F.

Melt the butter over low heat and set it aside.

Mix the eggs and sugar together and place them in a double boiler,
stirring constantly by hand until the sugar has dissolved and the
mixture is lukewarm.  Beat the mixture for about 5 minutes in a mixer
on high speed until tripled in volume and pale ivory in color.

Sift the flour twice, then gradually sift the flour over the
mixture, folding it in gently.  Add the cooled butter at the last and
fold gently but quickly.

Butter and flour the sides and bottoms of two 9-inch springform
pans. Pour the mixture into the pans.  Bake in a 350 F oven for about
20 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and cool on racks.

Preparation time:  1 1/2 hours
