Categories: Vegetables, Cake/cookie, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
-Salt and pepper
1 tb Minced green or red chilies
1/3 c  Flour
1/4 c  Safflower or other oil
8    Ears or 4 c. canned or
-frozen corn
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Pour the oil into a medium sized cast
iron or other heavy oven proof skillet, and place in oven until
sizzling hot. If using fresh corn cut the kernels from cobs, should
be about 4 cups. Combine the corn, chiles, flour, salt and pepper.
Transfer the mixture to the hot oiled skillet, smoothing the top to
form an even layer, do not stir. Gently press the corn mixture down
to compact it. Bake until the corn mixture forms a bottom crust,
about 30 minutes. Loosen the corn cake from the edges of the skillet.
Place a serving plate over the skillet and invert the skillet.  Cut
into wedges at the table. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   03-17-95
