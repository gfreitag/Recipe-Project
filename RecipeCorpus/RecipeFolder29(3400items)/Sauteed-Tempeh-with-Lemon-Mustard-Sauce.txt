Title: Sauteed Tempeh with Lemon-Mustard Sauce
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 serving
1 tb Olive oil
1/8 lb Oyster mushrooms
1/2 ts Lemon juice
1/4 ts Whole grain mustard
1/2 tb Chives, chopped
2 c  Stock
1/8 c  Tamari or soy sauce
2 oz Tempeh
1/8 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tb Vegetable oil
Combine 3-1/2 cups of stock with soy sauce.  Bring the stock to a
simmer & steam the tempeh in the stock for 20 minutes. Remove the
tempeh and allow to cool.

Slice the tempeh into thin long strips and dust it in the flour.

Heat the oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat.  Add the
mushrooms and tempeh and saute until tempeh is golden and the
mushrooms are well cooked, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the
pan.

Keep the pan hot and add 1/2 cup of vegetable stock and the lemon
juice, then add the mustard and chives.  Simmer, uncovered, for one
minute.

Put the tempeh and mushrooms in a serving dish and cover with the
lemon-mustard sauce.  Serve immediately.
