Title: Vegetable Pilau Special
Categories: Main dish, Rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 serving
1 ea Piece ginger
-- (1/4 to 1/2 inch)
1 sm Tomato
1 tb Margarine
1 ts Coriander
1 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Garam masala
1/4 c  Slivered almonds
1/2 c  Long-grain brown rice
Sea salt to taste
1 ts Tumeric
2 oz Fresh green beans
1 sm Carrot
1/3 c  Shelled peas
1 sm Onion
1 sm Garlic clove
Cover the rice with boiling water and leave to soak for several hours.
Drain, rinse, cover with water, add a little salt and the tumeric,
bring to the boil, then lower heat, and cook until the water is
absorbed and rice tender, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, chop the beans and carrot. Steam them -- and the peas --
until just tender.  Drain and set aside.

Chop the onion.  Crush the garlic.  Grate the ginger finely.  Chop the
tomato.

Heat the margarine in a pan and add the onion.  Saute until beginning
to brown.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a minute longer.
Lower heat and stir in the spices.  Then add the tomato and cook for
a minute longer. Remove from heat and stir in the cooked vegetables.

Place half the cooked rice on the bottom of a greased ovenproof dish,
spoon the vegetable mixture over it, then top with the other half of
the rice. Cover the dish (if it has no lid then use foil) and bake it
at 350F (180 C) Gas Mark 4 for about half an hour.

Toast the almonds under a hot grill (broiler) until lightly browned.
When the pilau is ready and dished up, sprinkle the almonds on top.
