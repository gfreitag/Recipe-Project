Categories: Puddings, Rice, Fruit
Yield: 10 servings
1 c  Granulated sugar
1    Egg yolk
1 1/2 c  Whipped cream
Raisins (optional)
1 qt Milk
1 pt Heavy cream
1/2 ts Salt
1    Vanilla bean
3/4 c  Long-grained rice
In a heavy saucepan, combine the milk, cream, salt, vanilla bean and
3/4 cup of the sugar and bring to a boil. Stirring well, add the
rice. Allow the mixture to simmer gently, covered, for 1 3/4 hours
over a very low flame, until rice is soft. Remove from the heat and
cool slightly. Remove the vanilla bean. Blending well, stir in the
remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and the egg yolk. Allow to cool a bit
more. Preheat the broiler. Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the
whipped cream; pour the mixture into individual crocks or a souffle
dish. (Raisins my be placed in the bottom of the dishes, if desired.)
After spreading the remaining whipped cream in a thin layer over the
top, place the crocks or dish under the broiler until the pudding is
lightly browned. Chill before serving.
