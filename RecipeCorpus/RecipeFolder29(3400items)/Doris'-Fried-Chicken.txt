Title: Doris' Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
-Polyunsaturated Oil
2 tb Butter
2 tb Sesame Seeds
3 tb Water
1 c  Water From Cooked
-Potatoes/Other Veggies
1    3 5 Lb chicken
1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Paprika
2 ts Salt
Lots Of Freshly Ground
-Black Pepper
1/2 c  Canola Oil Or Other
1. Cut the chicken into serving pieces: you should have 2 legs, 2
thighs, and 2 wings. Then cut out the breast, or "pulley" bone; break
off the breast cartilage and separate the two breast pieces with
their ribs. Crack the back into two pieces.

2. Combine the flour, paprika, salt and pepper. Dust the chicken
well, then shake off the excess. Save the excess flour mixture for
gravy.

3. In a large skillet, heat the oil and butter over high heat. Add the
chicken and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Fry the chicken parts until
brown on one side, then turn.

4. Add the 3 Tbs of water to the skillet, lower the heat to moderate
and cover the skillet. Cover and cook until tender, 20 to 30 mins.
Remove the chicken pieces to a plate.

5. Make the gravy. Over moderately high heat, add 2 Tbs of the
reserved flour and a little of the potato liquid. Scrape up the
browned bits from the pan and stir constantly until mixture is nicely
browned. Add the rest of the potato water and cook until gravy is
thickened and brown. Add lots of pepper. Serve at once, with potatoes.
