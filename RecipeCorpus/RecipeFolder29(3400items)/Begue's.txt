Chef Michel Marcais presides not only over the kitchen at
Begue's, in New Orleans' Royal Sonesta Hotel, but also all the other
food service operations in the hotel.  This is a tremendously
demanding job, but Marcais is certainly up to it.  He is one of a
handful of Master Chefs of France, and one of the very few practicing
outside that country.

Chef Marcais is well-travelled, but his culinary roots are
classic French.  He brings his expertise to local ingredients,
embellishing them with the finest imported foods.  (Note the crawfish
and truffles in the soup and the sweet potatoes in a French beignet
batter.) Chef Marcais is a recognized artist in the displaying of
food. He cleverly transforms duck legs into little "hams" and blocks
of ice into intricate sculptures.

The Chef's preparations are beautiful, to be sure, but they are
also delicious.  While the amateur may not be able to garnish as Chef
Marcais does, the dishes will nevertheless delight all who taste them.
