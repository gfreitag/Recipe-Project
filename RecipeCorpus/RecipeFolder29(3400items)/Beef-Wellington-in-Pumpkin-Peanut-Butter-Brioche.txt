To prepare brioche dough:

Combine yeast, water and sugar in 2-cup measure.  Set aside.

In food processor fitted with steel blade (or strong blender), combine
flour, salt and cloves.  Pulse 5 times to combine.  Add butter.
Process 15 seconds.

In small saucepan, combine pumpkin and peanut butter.  Stir over low
heat until peanut butter melts (about 3 minutes).  Remove from heat.
Set aside.

Whisk eggs into yeast mixture.  With food processor (or blender)
running, pour mixture through feed tube.  Process 1 minute.  Add
peanut butter mixture.  Process 30 seconds.  Dough will be sticky.

Place dough in large oiled bowl.  Cover with oiled plastic wrap.  Let
rise 2 hours or until almost tripled in size.  Scrape dough down with
spatula. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, preheat oven to 425F.

To prepare duxelle:  In 12-inch skillet melt butter with 1/4 cup oil
over high heat.  Add mushrooms, shallots and salt.  Saute until
mushroom liquid is absorbed (about 8 to 10 minutes), stirring
frequently. Add brandy. Cook 2 minutes.  Remove from heat. Vigorously
stir in peanut butter until mixture is smooth.  Place in bowl. Set
aside.

On wax paper, combine flour, salt and nutmeg.  Dredge each tenderloin
in mixture to coat.

In same skillet, heat remaining peanut oil over medium0high heat. Sear
tenderloins on all sides (about 5 minutes).  Remove from heat. Set
aside.

Remove brioche from refrigerator.  On lightly floured surface, divide
dough into 8 equal pieces.  Roll 1 piece at a time into 8x7-inch
rectangle. Spread scant 1/4 cup duxelle mixture over center.  Place 1
tenderloin on top.  Lift sides and ends of dough over top to close.
Invert, and place on large, oiled baking sheet.  Repeat with
remaining dough, duxelle and meat. Brush each with egg to glaze.

Bake 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350F and bake 10 minutes longer for
medium-rare. (The World's Greatest Peanut Butter Cookbook by Linda
