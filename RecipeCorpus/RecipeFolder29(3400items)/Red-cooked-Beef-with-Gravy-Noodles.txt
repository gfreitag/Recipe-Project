Categories: Meats, Chinese
Yield: 2 servings
2 c  Water
1/4 c  Black soy sauce
1 tb Chinjiang vinegar
1    Scallions
1 1/2 sl Ginger
GRAVY INGREDIENTS:
5/8 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Medium sherry
1/2 ts Ground bean sauce
1/4 ts Sugar
Cornstarch paste
1/2 lb Boned chuck roast
1 1/2 tb Cooking oil
1 tb Peanut oil
1    Scallions, coarsely chopped
1    Cloves garlic, minced
1/8 ts Fresh ginger, minced
2 lg Stalks Napa cabbage, leaves
-removed, cut in 2" squares
1/4 lb Fresh egg noodles
RED-COOKING LIQUID:
1/2 ts Sichuan peppercorns
A fatty cut of beef gives this dish more beef flavor, which is the
point of the dish; rich, mellow, gently seasoned. RED-COOKING MEAT:
In medium hot wok, toast peppercorns until fragrant (avoid burning);
crush & finely mince with cleaver; reserve. Cut beef into 1 1/2"
chunks. Heat cooking oil in hot wok until it starts to smoke; brown
beef in several batches; drain oil & discard. Combine peppercorns &
remaining ingredients of red-cooking liquid; add to wok.  Bring to
boil; reduce heat & simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until meat
is very tender. (If liquid evaporates before meat is tender, add cup
of water or stock and continue cooking.) Remove meat from liquid.  If
desired, cool meat, cover and refrigerate. BOILING NOODLES: Bring 4
qts. water to rolling boil; add noodles. Drain when still slightly
undercooked. STIR-FRYING: Heat peanut oil in hot wok. When oil starts
to smoke, add scallions & stir-fry until fragrant.  Add garlic,
ginger & Napa cabbage; stir-fry for about 1 minute, until cabbage is
slightly wilted. Add meat & all gravy ingredients except cornstarch
paste. Reduce heat to medium, cover, & simmer for about 3 minutes.
Remove cover; dribble in enough cornstarch paste to make a light
gravy; not too heavy as you want to coat noodles, but not too soupy
either. Turn up heat; when sauce returns to boil, add noodles.  Toss
to mix (& reheat) noodles. Transfer to warmed serving platter or
large bowl. Submitted By TERRI WOLTMON   On   04-03-95
