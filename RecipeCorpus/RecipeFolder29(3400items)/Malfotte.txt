Preheat oven to 350 F. In a skillet, melt the butter, add the onion,
and saute until lightly browned. In a large bowl, mix the sauteed
onion, Swiss chard, ground beef, 1 cup grated cheese, eggs, and bread
crumbs. Take a small handful of the mixture and form into
sausage-like rolls about 3 inches long. Place some flour in a dish
and roll each malfotte in flour until well coated. Bring a large
saucepan half full of water to a boil. Place the malfottes into the
pan and boil until they float to the top, about 5 to 7 mins. Remove
them with a slotted spoon and drain. Cover the bottom of a baking pan
with tomato sauce and place the malfottes in the pan in a single
layer. Cover with sauce and sprinkle with the reamining Parmesan
cheese.

Bake for about 20 to 30 mins.
