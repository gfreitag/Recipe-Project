Categories: Pastry, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 1 servings
-- large chunks
3/4 c  Water, cold (about)
4 c  Flour, instant, or more
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 lb Butter, unsalted, cut into
For Quick Puff Pastry: ======================

In a mixing bowl or mixer, roughly combine the flour, salt and
butter, breaking up the butter slightly (there should be visible
chunks). Gradually add just enough cold water to hold the dough
together. DO NOT OVERWORK.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll it
into a rectangular shape about 9 by 12 inches.  Dust the board,
dough, and rolling pin with flour as often as necessary to prevent
sticking. Starting with the closest short end, fold the dough into
thirds as you would a letter.  Rotate the dough so the open side is
at your right. Repeat, rolling the dough into a rectangle, folding it
into thirds and rotating is as before.  Wrap the dough in plastic
wrap and chill for at least 1 hour.

Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface with the open
side at your right.  Roll the dough into a rectangle as before.  Now
bring the two short ends together to meet in the center of the dough,
then fold the dough in half again toward you.  Rotate a 1/4 turn, so
the open side is again at your right.  Repeat, rolling the dough into
a rectangle, folding in half, then in half again, and rotating a 1/4
turn. Wrap the dough and chill again for at least 1 hour.
