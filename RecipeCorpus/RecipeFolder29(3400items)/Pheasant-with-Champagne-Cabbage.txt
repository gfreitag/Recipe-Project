For Mousseline Stuffing: ========================

Puree chicken pieces in processor until smooth.  Add egg white
and process until smooth.  With the processor running, add the cream
in a thin stream - then add the Port wine, salt and pepper.

Transfer to a bowl, and fold in the remaining stuffing
ingredients. Adjust seasonings to taste, and chill, covered.

The Pheasant: =============

With a sharp boning knife, carefully remove each breast half
from the pheasants and set aside.  Remove the legs with thighs
attached. To bone each leg-thigh portion, use a sharp boning or
paring knife to slit the leg and thigh meat, cutting parallel to the
bones.  Carefully scrape thigh meat away from the bone.  Cut through
the joint between the leg and thigh, keeping meat in 1 piece.  Scrape
away all remaining thigh meat and cut or pull out thighbone.

Use a cleaver to cut off the knob end of the leg.  Scrape meat
from the gone and pull out the bone.

Refrigerate meat, covered.  Reserve bones and carcasses.

Place the leg-thigh portions, skin side down and short ends
toward yourself between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; flatten gently with
a mallet or side of a cleaver.

Spread about 1/3 cup of stuffing on each portion and fold meat
over to form a 1/2-inch border on each of 2 long sides.

Starting with a short side, roll into a neat cylinder.  Use
kitchen twine to tie compactly, wrapping twine around once lengthwise
and 3 times crosswise.  Chill, covered, until firm (at least 30
minutes.)

Preheat oven to 450 F. Heat 6 tablespoons of clarified butter in
a large oven-proof skillet.  Salt and pepper the stuffed leg packages
and saute, shaking pan occasionally, until golden on all sides (about
4 minutes.)  Place skillet in over and roast for 4 minutes.

Return skillet to top of stove over medium-high heat.  Add breast
halves to the pan, skin side up, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Saute for 2 minutes, shaking pan occasionally.  Turn breasts skin
side down, sprinkle with salt and pepper and return to the oven until
everything is tender (about 7 minutes.)

For Sauce: ==========

Meanwhile, cook sugar, without stirring, in small heavy saucepan
over medium-high heat until caramelized (about 4 minutes.) Add gin
and stock; boil until reduced by half.  Add wine and return to a
boil. Lower heat and swirl in 1/4 cup of butter, 1 or 2 pieces at a
time, until smooth. Adjust seasonings to taste with salt and pepper.

Transfer meat to work surface.  Cut leg-thigh portions crosswise
into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Thinly slice breasts lengthwise on a
diagonal.

Mound about 1/2 cup of cabbage in the center of each of 4 warmed
serving plates.  Place leg-thigh slices around bottom of each plate,
overlapping slightly.  Place breast slices in a fan pattern at top of
each plate, overlapping slightly.  Spoon some sauce around the meat
and cabbage; serve the rest of the sauce separately.
