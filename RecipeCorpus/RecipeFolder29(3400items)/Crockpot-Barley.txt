Title: Crockpot Barley
Categories: Fatfree, Crockpot, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 lb Mushrooms, chopped
Dash of garlic spice blend
8 c  Water
1 ea Bragg's Aminos to taste
1 c  Brown rice
1 c  Barley
6    Carrots, chunked
1    Onion, chopped
put a lid on it and cook on low overnight.

In the AM I added a dash of Bragg's Aminos for the saltiness I
wanted. It was really good and my spouse had seconds. There is enough
left for at least one more breakfast for two.

Source: I bought Mary McDougals cookbook II and adapted this recipe
for grains.
