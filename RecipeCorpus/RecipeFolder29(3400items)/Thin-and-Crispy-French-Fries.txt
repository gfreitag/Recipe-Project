Title: Thin and Crispy French Fries
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
Crisco Shortening to fry
-potatoes
2    Medium-sized potatoes per
-serving
Cold water
Using knife or French-fry cutter, cut peeled potatoes into 1/4"
strips. Rinse or soak in cold water.  Start heating enough Crisco
Shortening to fill a 3-quart saucepan half full, or a deep fryer
within 1/2" of the fill mark.  Dry potato strips thoroughly on paper
towel.

FOR EXTRA QUICK FRENCH FRIES:  Heat deep Crisco Shortening to 365
degrees F.  For electric deep fryer, follow manufacturer's directions
for amount of potato strips to fry at one time.  For saucepan, cook
2-3 cups of potato strips at one time, adding slowly.  Cook until
potatoes are tender and lightly browned, about 10-15 minutes.  Drain
potatoes on paper towel. While frying remaining potatoes, keep fried
ones warm in oven set at low temperature.  Salt or season as desired.
If desired, frozen French fried potatoes can be used in place of
fresh potatoes. For best results, fry about 10-15 minutes in Crisco
Shortening using the above directions.

FOR EXTRA CRISP FRENCH FRIES (FOR FRESH POTATOES ONLY):  Fry potatoes
FIRST time at 325 degrees F. for about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain
on paper towel.  Cool at least 15 minutes at room temperature.  If
desired, cool up to 3 hours.  To serve, re-heat crisco to 365 degrees
F. and fry potato strips a second time for 6-8 minutes or until
golden brown. Drain on paper towel.

This recipe has been on the Crisco label since 1938.
