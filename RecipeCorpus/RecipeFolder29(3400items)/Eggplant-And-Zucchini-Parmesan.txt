Preheat oven to 350 F.

Cut the unpeeled eggplants and zucchini into slices about 1/4-inch
thick.

Dip the eggplant slices into the egg and milk mixture. (Error in
directions; assume you whisk the egg and milk together), then into the
bread crumbs.

In a large skillet, heat the oil until very hot, add the breaded
eggplant, and fry on both sides until golden brown. Drain on paper
towels. Fry the zucchini as is, do not put into bread crumbs. Drain.

In a large baking pan, place a layer of tomato sauce in the bottom to
cover and follow with a layer of eggplant slices, mozzarella cheese,
Parmesan cheese, zucchini and pinch of salt. Repeat the layers,
ending with tomato sauce. Top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
Bake for 20 to 25 mins.
