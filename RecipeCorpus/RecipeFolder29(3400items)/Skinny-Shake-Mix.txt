Title: Skinny Shake Mix
Categories: Poultry, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Paprika
1 ts Freshly ground pepper
Additional seasonings to
Taste
4 c  (16 oz.) bread crumbs
1/2 c  Salad oil
1 tb Salt
1 tb Celery salt
* Like Shake 'n Bake only better for ya

Put the bread crumbs in a deep bowl, stir in the salad oil with a
fork or pastry blender.  Add all the seasonings and others to suit
yourself--herbs, garlic or onion powder, lemon peppers, etc.  Keep
well covered in a moisture-proof container (tupperware type) with a
tightly fitted lid.  Use as needed.

Makes enough for 20 cut-up chickens or 30 servings of fish, even pork
chops.

NOTE: Store in tupperware like container and dish out enough into
another bowl for the meal.  Toss the chicken, fish, or pork, in the
meal and bake.

Be careful not to toss the meat in your main supply.

Put the meat on a cookie sheet after coating and bake.

Bake at 375 for one hour unless pork chops are thin.

For fish add water--moistened fillets to a plastic bag full of crumbs
(about 1/3 cup per pound of fish, one at a time ) and shake to coat.
Place on a nonstick baking sheet or dish in a preheated 375 degree
oven.

Do not add fat or oil.  The fish will be oven-fried to perfection in
10-12 min. only 144 calories per serving

For chicken use as for pork chops and toss and coat and bake 1 hour.
Don't see why you couldn't use a zip lock bag and toss.

I love this stuff.  Tried it on fish and pork chops so far very good.
