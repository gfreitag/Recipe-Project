Categories: Cake/cookie, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 ts Sifted baking soda

From "Old San Francisco Steak House"

In saucepan, mix sugar with coffee, corn syrup and water. Cook to the
hard crack stage, 285 F on candy thermometer.  Remove from heat and
add soda all at once.  Stir vigorously, but only until mixture blends
and pulls away from pan.  Quickly pour onto a piece of foil paper. Do
not spread or stir. Let it cool and harden. Then crush it into crumbs.

Cut an angel food cake into 2 layers.  Mix some of the powdered parts
of candy into Cool Whip.  Spread over first layer of cake. Add some
of teh larger pieces of candy.  Add second layer of cake. Spread with
more Cool Whip.  Add generous amounts of candy and toasted slivered
almonds. Refrigerate until ready to serve. It is tastier if it is put
together a couple of hours before it is to be served. It will not be
as good the second day as it gets weepy and gthe candy softens.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings
