TOBY'S KNEIDLACH

Matzah meal kneidlach are made for Pessach (Passover). The following
recipe is for the "light as a feather" variety. I use the same recipe
to make gnocchi-like dumplings to be served with tomato sauce and
grated cheese. Some recipes recommend flavouring with powdered ginger
and cinnamon while others add ground almonds or almond essence to the
mix.

* To serve as gnocchi, I use a full-flavoured olive oil and a
spoonfull of chopped herbs (dill, parsley or basil)

Mix all the ingredients together. Allow the mixture to rest in a cool
place for at least 2 hours. Shape into small balls and cook in
boiling soup or salted boiling water for 10-15 minute or until
dumplings float to the top. Drain. Serve in chcken soup or as a side
dish with stew.
