Title: 360003 Pasta Bow Ties With Cabbage
Categories: Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Onions, chopped
3 c  Thinly sliced green cabbage
2 c  Thinly sliced red cabbage
3/4 c  Light cream
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan or Romano
Cheese
1/2 lb Pasta bow ties
1/2 c  Olive oil
3 tb Butter
3    Cloves garlic, minced
6    Anchovies, flat
1/8 ts Dried red pepper flakes
Rinse anchovies, then soak in a little milk for an 1/2 hour before
using. This cuts the "fishy" taste.  Heat a large fry pan, add the
oil, butter, garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes. Saute for a
few minutes until the anchovies mash up.  Add the onions and saute
until transparent. Add the cabbage and saute over low heat just until
tender. Meanwhile, cook the pasta to taste; drain. Add the cream to
the vegetable sauce and simmer lightly.  Toss this mixture with the
pasta; stir in cheese. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   04-23-95
