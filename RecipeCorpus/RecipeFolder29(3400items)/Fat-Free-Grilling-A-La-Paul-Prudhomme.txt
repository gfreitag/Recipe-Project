I saw Paul Prudhomme, the Cajun cook, on a "Home" show this weekend.
He said the secret to cooking without fat is to have the non-stick
pan *HOT* when you put the vegetables in to start cooking. He
recommended the pan be at 350 degrees and he had a special flat,
circular thermometer that he lays in the pan to check the temperature.

Has anyone used one of these thermometers??? How did it work?

Paul's technique for cooking was also very interesting. He started by
browning sliced peppers (yellow and red) and carrots in the hot pan.
He later added moreof the same vegetables so that they would be less
cooked and have a different flavor. He said this added to the
complexity of flavors in the dish. He also added spices (Cajun of
course) at each level of cooking.

After he cooked the vegetables, he added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar
and 1/4 cup of tamari and cooked that down. He later added broth,
tomato sauce and corn starch... and more spices. I think he also put
in onions and garlic at the same time as the vinegar and tamari.
