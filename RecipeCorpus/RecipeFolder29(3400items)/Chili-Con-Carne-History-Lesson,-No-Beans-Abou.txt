=========================> Information <=========================

Chili con carne, disclaimed by Mexicans as "a detestable food with a
false Mexican title"  is nevertheless, a true Mex-American child of
the border. It originated in towns like San Antonio, where poor
Mexican families made a little meat go a long way with lots of chili.
J. C. Cooper, first described the dish in 1828 as a "kind of hash
with nearly as many peppers as there are pieces of meat."  In 1880s,
however, the dish became fashionable when sporting ladies known as
"chili queens" dished out chili from open-air stalls around Alamo
Plaza at night for San Antonio on the prowl for a hot dish. The Texas
fashion went national when Texas set up a state chili booth at the
1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago and when a German, named William
Gebhardt who had operated a cafe in New Braunfels, Texas, exploited
the new taste in 1908 by canning the stuff.

Ever since then, prize-winning recipes at the annual Chili Cookoffs in
rival Tropico, California, and Terlingua, Texas, rely heavily on
canned tomatoes and premixed commercial chili powder. New Mexicans,
on the other hand, insist of freshly made chili pulp or at least pure
ground chili.
