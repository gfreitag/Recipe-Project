Categories: Desserts, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 1 servings
-- (garnish)
1 md Pineapple
8 sl Cantaloupe, thin slices
MMMMM-------------------------RUM CREAM------------------------------
-- and cut into pieces
2 tb Rum, dark
1/3 c  Cream, whipping
3 ea Egg yolks
3 tb Sugar, superfine
1/2 c  Butter, unsalted, chilled
For Rum Cream: ==============

In the top of a double boiler, blend the egg yolks and sugar.
Place this over boiling water and whisk until warm to the touch.  Add
the butter, 1 or 2 pieces at a time.  When all of the butter has been
incorporated, whisk until lightly thickened, 1 or 2 minutes longer.

Remove from heat and cool, whisking occasionally.  When cool,
gradually whisk in the rum and fold in about 1/3 cup of whipped cream.

Cut off the base and stem of the pineapple, reserving a few small
leaves for garnish.  Quarter the pineapple lengthwise and then remove
the skin and core with a sharp knife.  Slice each quarter lengthwise
into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

To Assemble: ============

Arrange the pineapple slices on chilled plates, overlapping
slightly. Gently curl the cantaloupe slices in the shape of an "S"
and place 2 pieces on each plate as garnish.  Garnish with reserved
pineapple leaves. Spoon some of the rum cream over the pineapple and
serve remainder of the cream on the side.
