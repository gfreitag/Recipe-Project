Title: Toffee Crunch Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 4 dozen
2 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
9    Bars (1.4 oz each) chocolate
-covered almond toffee candy
-cut into chunks*
1 c  Chopped almonds
2 3/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/4 c  Unsifted cake flour
1 1/4 ts Salt
3/4 lb (3 sticks) unsalted butter;
-softened
1 1/3 c  Granulated sugar
*I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I wonder if Skor candy bars
could be used.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line two cookie sheets with lengths
of parchment paper.

Sift together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, and salt.

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on low speed
for 5 minutes.  Add the sugar in two additions, beating for 2 minutes
on moderate speed after each portion is added.  Blend in the vanilla
extract. On low speed, add the sifted mixture and mix until the
particles of flour are absorbed.  Stir in the toffee and almonds.

For each batch, drop heaping tablespoon-size mounds of dough onto a
lined cookie sheet, spacing the mounds about 2 inches apart.

Bake the cookies for 15 minutes, or until golden.  After 1 minute,
transfer the cookies to cooling racks using a wide metal spatula.
Cool completely.

Store in an airtight container.
