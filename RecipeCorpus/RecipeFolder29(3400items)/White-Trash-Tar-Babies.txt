Categories: Breads, Cake/cookie, Whitetrash
Yield: 1 servings
Pecans, chopped
Cinnamon
Chocolate bar
Biscuit dough
Butter
Brown sugar
Make biscuit dough.  Spread it out to about 1/2 inch thick.  Spread
butter over all and coat it with brown sugar. Roll it up like you
would dampen clothes that you are going to iron.  Cut into 20 rounds
and place on a greased cookie sheet.  Sprinkle a bit more brown
sugar, some cinnamon and few more chopped nuts over top.  Bake in a
400F over until browned. Remove from oven, break up chocolate bar and
sprinkle over top of rolls. Place back in the oven just until the
chocolate melts.  Now they are Tar Babies. Serve while still warm and
gooey. Warning: Once you pick them up, you won't be able to put them
down until they're all gone 'cuz they are stuck to you. Origin:
