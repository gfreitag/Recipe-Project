"The tangy barbecue sauce, fluffy biscuits and cheddar cheese make
them real kid-pleasers." - Karen Kenney

Separate dough into 10 biscuits; flatten into 5" circles. Press each
into the bottom and up the sides of a greased muffin cup; set aside.
In a skillet, brown ground beef; drain. In a small bowl, mix ketchup,
brown sugar, vinegar and chili powder; stir until smooth. Add to meat
and mix well.  Divide the meat mixture among biscuit-lined muffin
cups, using about 1/4 cup for each.  Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at
375 degrees for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown.

Cool for 5 minutes before removing from tin and serving.
