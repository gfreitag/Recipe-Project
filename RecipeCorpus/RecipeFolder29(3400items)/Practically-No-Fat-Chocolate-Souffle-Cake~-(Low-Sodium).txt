"A rich cake based on a French-countryside recipe from restaurant
consultant Rozanne Gold.  Made without butter, and with cocoa powder
instead of chocolate, the cake is like a souffle that rises, then
sinks as it cools."

Preheat oven to 350 F. Line bottom of 8-inch springform pan with
2-3/4-inch high sides with parchment paper. Spread pan and paper with
vegetable oil spray. Sprinkle pan with 2 tablespoons sugar. Finely
grind nuts with 2 tablespoons sugar in processor. Transfer nut
mixture to large bowl. Mix in 10 tablespoons sugar and cocoa, then
oil.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in large bowl until
soft peaks form.  Fold whites into cocoa mixture in 3 additions.
Spoon batter into prepared pan; smooth top.

Bake until cake puffs and tester inserted into center comes out with
moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack
about 30 minutes.  (Cake may fall.)  Cut around pan sides to loosen
cake.  Remove sides of pan and cool cake completely.  Sprinkle cake
with powdered sugar.
