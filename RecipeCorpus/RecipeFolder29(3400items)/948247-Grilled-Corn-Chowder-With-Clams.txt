Soak the ears of corn in cold water for 15 minutes.  Trim away corn
silk. Barbecue ears over a grill for 15 to 20 minutes or until husks
are slightly charred.  Do not allow the husks to catch fire. When
cool enough to handle, husk corn and slice off the kernels with a
sharp knife. Firmly run the dull side of the knife blade along the
ears to squeeze out any creamy liquid remaining in the cob.  Set
aside. In a large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.
Whisk in flour, white pepper and nutmeg. Cook for 1 minute until
flour adheres to bottom and sides of pan. Add the chicken broth
slowly, stirring constantly, until broth has thickened slightly. Add
the onion, garlic and corn . Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir in
the buttermilk, clams and sherry.  Heat through but do not boil.
Divide into portions and garnish with parsley.
