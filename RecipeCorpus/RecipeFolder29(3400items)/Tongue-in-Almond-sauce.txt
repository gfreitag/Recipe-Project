the bread into an electric blender. Blend to a thick puree. Heat lard
in a skillet. Add the pureed mixture and cook about 5 minutes. Stir
in tongue stock and remaining 1/4 cup raisins. Cook about 5minutes,
stirring constantly. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour sauce
over sliced meat in Dutch oven and simmer until meat is heated
through. Transfer meat and sauce to platter and garnish with slivered
almonds. 8 to 10 servings.
