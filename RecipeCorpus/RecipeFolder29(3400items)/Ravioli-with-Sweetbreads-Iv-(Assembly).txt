Title: Ravioli with Sweetbreads Iv (Assembly)
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 6 servings
Parsley, chopped (garnish)
To Assemble: ============

Place 1 sheet of the prepared dough on ravioli form or work
surface. Dot with 18 teaspoonfuls of filling placed 1 inch apart.
Using a pastry brush dipped in cold water, moisten dough between
mounds of filling.

Gently lay a second sheet of pasta on top of the first sheet
with its mounds of filling, pressing between carefully between the
mounds of filling to seal the two sheets together.  Cut the dough
into neat squares. Repeat, using remaining 2 sheets of pasta and
remaining filling. Set aside on lightly floured baking sheet.

Preheat oven to 450 F.  Bring the cream and remaining 1/2 cup of
chopped shallot to a simmer then set aside.

Cook the ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water for 2
minutes. Drain and immediately transfer to wide, shallow baking dish.

Pour the cream and shallot over the ravioli and bake until the
cream is bubbly and has thickened slightly, 5 to 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the trimmed sweetbreads and Bordelaise Sauce or
Veal Stock in small saucepan.  Simmer, uncovered, until the mixture
is reduced to syrupy consistency.

Transfer ravioli and cream to warm serving plates.  Spoon a few
pieces of sweetbreads with their sauce into the center of each
portion. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.
