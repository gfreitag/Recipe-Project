MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1 ts Vanilla
1 lb Powdered sugar; sifted
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
8 oz Cream cheese; softened
Sift together flour, baking powder, soda, salt and cinnamon. Beat
eggs and add sugar. Let stand until sugar dissolves, about 10
minutes. Stir in oil, carrots, drained pineapple and nuts. Turn into
3 greased and floured 9-inch round cake pans or 1 (13- x 9-inch) pan
and bake at 350F 35 to 40 minutes for layer pans and about 55 minutes
for 13- x 9-inch pan, or until cake springs back when lightly
touched. Cool in pans about 10 minutes, then turn onto wire racks to
cool completely.

To make frosting, combine butter, cream cheese and vanilla in large
bowl and beat until well blended. Add powdered sugar gradually,
beating vigorously. If too thick, thin with milk to spreading
consistency. Frost between layers, top and sides of layer cake. Frost
top and sides of sheet cake.
