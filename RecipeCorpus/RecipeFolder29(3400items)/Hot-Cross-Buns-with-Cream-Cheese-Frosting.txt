BUNS: Combine 2 cups of flour, the yeast, granulated sugar, salt and
spices in a large mixer bowl.  Heat milk and butter to very warm (120
to 130 degrees).  Add to flour mixture.  Beat on medium speed of an
electric mixer for 1 minute. Add eggs. Beat another minute.  Stir in
currants, orange peel and enough remaining flour to make dough easy
to handle. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Knead until
smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding additional flour as
needed. Place in a buttered bowl, turning to butter top.  Cover; let
rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Punch down
dough; turn onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half;
divide each half into 9 pieces. Form each piece into a ball.  Place
balls of dough in two butter 8" square baking pans. Cover; let rise
in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Brush lightly with egg yolk mixture. Bake rolls in preheated 375
degrees oven for 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from
pans. Cool on wire rack.  Prepare Cream Cheese Frosting. Drizzle
frosting across each bun in the shape of a cross.

FROSTING: Beat softened cream cheese and confections' sugar in bowl
until smooth.  Add up to 1 teaspoon milk to attain drizzling
consistency.
