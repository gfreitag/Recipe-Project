Title: Rabbit With Apricots In Cabernet Sauce
Categories: French
Yield: 4 servings
Salt -- coarse
Pepper -- ground
3 tb Oil -- peanut
4 tb Butter
1 c  Demi-glaze -- rabbit
1 ea Rabbit -- young
1 c  Cabernet Sauvignon
1 oz Vinegar -- red wine
2 ea Garlic, cloves -- unpeeled
Bouquet garni **
5 oz Apricots -- dried
** Bouquet garni is a mixture of thyme, rosemary, parsley, and bay
leaf, tied up together in a cheesecloth bag. Bone the rabbit saddle,
legs, and shoulders and cut the meat into cubes of about 1 ounce
each. Marinate the meat in the wine and vinegar with garlic and
bouquet garni for 12 hours, covering rabbit with cheesecloth so it
will not dry out. Soak apricots in cold water for 1 hour, then drain.

Drain rabbit, reserving marinade and garniture.  Dry rabbit well and
season with salt and pepper. In a heavy casserole, heat the oil and 2
tablespoons of butter. Add the rabbit and brown on all sides
(approximately 20 minutes until meat is gray). Add garlic, bouquet
garni, reserved marinade, apricots, and rabbit demi-glace. Cut a
circle of wax paper, butter it lightly, and place it over the rabbit.
Cover the casserole and simmer for 20 - 30 minutes.

Remove bouquet garni and discard.

Retrieve cloves of garlic and remove the peel.  Mash garlic into a
paste with the remaining butter. Remove the rabbit and apricots from
the sauce, set aside and keep warm. Stir the garlic paste into the
sauce a little at a time.

Arrange rabbit and apricots on a serving plate and cover with sauce.
