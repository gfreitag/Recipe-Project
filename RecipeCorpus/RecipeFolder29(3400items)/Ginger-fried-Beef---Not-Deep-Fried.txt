MMMMM---------------------------NOTES--------------------------------
If you thought soy sauce was soy sauce, Alice Ho offers these tips
: "Black and light soy sauces are distinguishable. If you shake the
light sauce, the bottle is transparent. This is easier that
deciphering the chinese characters on the bottles."  Ho says the
baking powder in this recipe acts as a meat tenderizer. DIRECTIONS:
Cut beef into shreds, while partially frozen.  Use a sharp cleaver or
chef's knife. Prepare onion, pepper, ginger and garlic; set aside.
Pour marinade ingredients (mixed together) over beef and let stand
for 30 minutes (longer if you wish). Heat wok or wide skillet; add 2
tbs vegetable oil.  Fry onion and pepper in hot oil, stirring
constantly.  Add salt and pepper to taste, and cook for a minute.
Vegetables should be crisp and glistening. Remove from pan. Add
another 2 tbs oil to the pan; heat and add garlic and ginger. Add
beef, stirring quickly to separate strips that cling together. Add
1/4 cup hot water; stir and cook for about a minute.  Return cooked
vegetables to wok and blend quickly. Season to taste, as you wish, or
add 1 tbs oyster sauce to enhance the flavor. Serve over hot steaming
rice. Serves 2. Offer a second stir-fry dish to round out the meal.
