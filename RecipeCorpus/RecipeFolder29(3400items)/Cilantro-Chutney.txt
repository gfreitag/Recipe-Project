Categories: Condiments, Relishes
Yield: 1 cup
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1    1" piece ginger (opt)
1    Garlic clove(s) (opt)
Water
1 c  Cilantro leaves and stems
-tightly packed
1 c  Grated coconut
1    To 2 hot green chilies
-cored and seeded
2 tb Lime juice
Put all the ingredients except the water in a blender or food
processor. Add  cup of water and blend. Scrape down the sides and
keep adding water and blending until the mixture is a thick paste.
(The goal is to use just enough water to rehydrate the coconut but
not so much that the paste is watery.)
