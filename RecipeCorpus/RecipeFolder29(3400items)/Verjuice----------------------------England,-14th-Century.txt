***********************
Apparently there were many ways to make verjuice, one of the two
most used bases for medieval English cooking (the other was Almond
Milk). de la Falaise doesn't provide an exact recipe.

In the second way described above, de la Falaise crushed some
crabapples and unripe grapes in a mortar, then put the pulp with a
little cider into a jar. She put the jar on a windowsill and let it
ferment for a couple of days, then strained the contents, and stored
the juice in the refrigerator.
