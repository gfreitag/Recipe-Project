Title: Bean Guacamole
Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers, Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 servings
6 tb Fresh lime juice
3 tb Water
2    Hot chilies, minced
2    Scallions, minced
1/4 c  Finely chopped cilantro
1 c  Dried white beans, soaked &
-cooked
3    Cloves garlic, crushed
Salt & pepper to taste
2 tb Olive oil
Use any kind of bean for this recipe (black beans don't do as well,
however):  white, navy, pea, pinto, garbanzo, kidney.  If you don't
want to deal with dry beans, use 2 cups of drained canned beans.

Puree all ingredients except scallions and cilantro in a food
processor or a blender, using more or less water to achieve your
desired texture. Work the green herbs in by hand;  if you use the
machine, the dip will be green. Transfer to a bowl and garnish with
additional cilantro sprigs.

Serve with tortilla chips.  Make your own low-fat chips by brushing
whole corn tortillas lightly with oil, cutting tortillas into wedges,
then baking in a 350 degree oven till brown and crisp, 10 to 15
minutes, turning once.

Adapted shamelessly from a recipe in Steven Raichlen's book, "High
Flavor, Low Fat Cooking".
