Title: Gratin of Strawberries
Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Masterchefs
Yield: 10 servings
8 md Egg whites
10 oz Cream, pastry ***
1/3 oz Gelatin
Puree, strawberry
Creme Anglaise **
Genoise **
1 c  Strawberries, fresh, large
4 oz Sugar
5 oz Water
** See recipe for Creme Anglaise, and Genoise.

*** Pastry cream is made by combining 5 ounces of regular cream
plus 5 ounces of cream mixed with 2 ounces of fresh squeezed lemon
juice.

Remove the stems from the strawberries and slice them in half.
Slice the genoise into very thin pieces to fit in the bottom of 10
molds, 3-4 inches in diameter.  (For molds, use plastic pipe cut into
2-inch strips.)

Line the molds with sliced strawberries, cut side facing outward.

In a saucepan, heat the sugar and water to a 250-degree softball.
Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of a mixer and whip them
to medium peaks.

In a metal bowl, whip together the pastry creams over boiling
water. When the cream is quite hot, take it off the hat, slowly
dissolve the powdered gelatin in the cream.

When the softball of sugar is formed, add to the egg whites while
still whipping on mixer.  Continue whipping until firm.  (As the sugar
cools, a meringue will form.)

Add this cream to the pastry creams then spoon the mixture into
the center of the molds.  Chill at least one hour.

To serve, unmold and sprinkle tops of molds with a tiny bit of
sugar. Glaze under broiler and unmold on serving plates.

Serve with creme anglaise and strawberry puree.
