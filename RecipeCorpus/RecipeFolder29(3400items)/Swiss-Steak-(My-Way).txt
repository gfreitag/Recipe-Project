Title: Swiss Steak (My Way)
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 servings
-sliced
2    Ribs CELERY, sliced
1 cn BEEF BROTH
1 cn STEWED TOMATOES (14-1/2
-ozs), drained
1/2 tb BROWN SUGAR (cuts the
-tomato-y taste)
CAJUN SEASONING (optional)
2 lb ROUND STEAK (doesn't have to
-be exact)
1/4 c  FLOUR
-To taste SALT
-SEASONED BLACK PEPPER
1 lg BELL PEPPER, julienned
1 md ONION, sliced
1    Cloves GARLIC, finely minced
1/2 c  CARROTS (small, sweet),
Combine the flour, salt and seasoned black pepper (the one I use has
chips of red pepper in it--plain pepper will do). Pound the flour
into the meat with a meat tenderizer or use the side of a plate. Cut
the meat into serving-size pieces.

Heat a large skillet, add oil and heat that up. Add the meat and
brown on both sides. Place the meat into your crockpot. You don't
HAVE to brown the meat, but it does give the gravy a much better
flavor.

Using the same skillet, add the bell pepper, onion, carrots and
celery; cook until the veggies are lightly browned. Add the garlic
and cook briefly. Add the veggies to the meat. Deglaze the pan with a
the beef broth--you want the goodies in the bottom. Add the beef
broth, tomatoes and brown sugar to the meat. I sometimes add Cajun
Seasoning--makes it taste a little like Creole food. Watch the salt,
if you add the Cajun seasoning, use it in place of the salt.

Cook on LOW for 7-8 hours. It could take less/more time, depending on
how tender the meat is to begin with. The meat will be fork-tender and
delicious. Enjoy.
