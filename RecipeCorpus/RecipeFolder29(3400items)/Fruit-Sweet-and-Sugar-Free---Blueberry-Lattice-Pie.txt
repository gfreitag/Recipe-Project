Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Blueberry Lattice Pie
Categories: Diabetic, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
Egg wash for pies and tarts
1    Basic pie crust (bottom)
5/8    Inch wide lattice strips
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 tb Water
2/3 c  Fruit sweetener
5 3/4 c  Frozen blueberries
1 1/4 ts Cinnamon
3/8 ts Nutmeg
3 1/2 ts Cornstarch
2 ts Lemon zest
Prepare the bottom crust according to the directions. The lattice
strips can be cut in advance and refrigerated, covered with plastic.
For ease of handling, remove them 10 minutes before they are needed.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl thoroughly mix
together all the filling ingredients, except the blueberries. Remove
the blueberries from the freezer to a large bowl. Add the
cornstarch/spice mixture and toss to coat the berries evenly. Pile
the blueberry filling into the unbaked crust. Prepare the egg wash
and brush it onto the rim of the crust. Top the pie with interwoven
lattice strips. Use the dull side of a small knife to trim off any
pastry extending beyond the edge of the pie pan. Seal the edge by
pressing lightly with the tines of a fork. Brush the lattice top with
egg wash. Place the pie directly into the freezer if it is not to be
baked immediately. To bake the pie, place it on a baking sheet in the
preheated oven, directly on the floor of a gas oven or on the lowest
shelf of an electric oven. Bake until the crust is golden and the
filling is bubbling to within 3 inches of the center of the pie,
approximately 1-3/4 to 2 hours. Cool the pie before cutting and
serving. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   04-09-95
