Title: Lentil Patties
Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, Sandwich
Yield: 5 patties
1/3 c  Bulgur, uncooked
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/8 ts Pepper
1 ts Soy sauce
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
2/3 c  Lentils, dried
1/3 c  Carrot, shredded
1 3/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Celery; finely chopped
1 md Onion; finely chopped
1 ts Garlic; finely chopped
In 2 quart saucepan combine lentils, carrot, water, celery, onion and
garlic.  Cook over high heat until mixture comes to a full boil (4-5
min) Reduce heat to medium.  Cover, continue cooking 10 minutes. Stir
in bulgur. Cover, continue cooking, stirring occasionally until
lentils and bulgur are tender and liquid is absorbed (10 - 15 min)
Stir in salt, chili powder, ground pepper and soy sauce; mix well,
mashing lentils *slightly*. Place in medium bowl; stir in bread
crumbs. Let stand 20 minutes until it cools down, stir again.

Form mixture into 5 or 6  1/2 inch thick patties.

Spray skillet with non stick cooking spray (do not use oil or butter)
heat over medium high heat until hot.  Reduce heat to medium, add 3
patties. Cook turning once until golden brown and heated through (4-6
minutes) Repeat with remaining patties.  As Patties are browned,
remove and place on rack while cooking others.

NOTE:  Patties appear fragile at first, but they do "stiffen" if they
stand for a few minutes.  Freeze well, defrost before warming again.
