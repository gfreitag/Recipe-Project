To every quart of good vinegar, put two quarts of raspberries: let
them stand for 24 hours; drain them off through a sieve, but do not
squeeze them; add the same quantity of raspberries to the strained
vinegar a second time; letting them stand as before.  Drain and add a
third quantity; when you have drained the fruitoff a third time,
measure the liquor into a stone covered-jar, and to each pint of
juice add a pound of lump sugar: Set the jar in a pot of boiling
water, and let the vinegar boil for ten minutes, sitrring it to mix
the sugar well through; when cold, bottle it for use. It is all the
better for standing for some months before being used.

A cheaper sort might be made with fine moist sugar, or with crushed
sugar, but must be well scummed.  Raspberry vinegar make an excellent
fever drink, a small quantity being mixed in a tumbler of cold water.
It is very refreshing in hot weather, and is made in considerable
quantities by those who have wild raspberries growing near the
clearings, and plenty of sugar at command. Origin: The Canadian
Settler's Guide, written in 1855. Shared by:  Sharon Stevens.
