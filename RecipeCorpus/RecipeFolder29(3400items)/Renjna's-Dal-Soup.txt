Title: Renjna's Dal Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Indian, Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
4 ea Jalapeno peppers
2 ts Garam masala
2 tb Cumin seeds
1/2 ts Salt
Additional salt to taste
2 c  Masoor dal (red lentils)
Water to cover
2 ts Turmeric
1 ts Salt
4 tb Canola oil
6 ea Cloves garlic
Sort and wash the dal until the water runs clear.  Place the dal in a
soup pot and add water to cover by about 2 inches.  Add the turmeric
and 1 teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
for about 30 minutes, until the dal is soft and beginning to fall
apart. Add more water if the dal is too thick.

Heat the oil in a frying pan.  Mince the garlic, coarsely chop the
jalapenos (remove the seeds if you don't want the dal to be very
hot). Add the garlic and jalapenos to the oil, along with the cumin
seeds, garam masala and salt.  Saute for a few minutes, until the
garlic begins to brown.  Add this mixture to the dal.  Mix well (you
may need to add a little dal to the frying pan and pour this back
into the pot to get all the spices out of the pan).  Simmer for
another 20 minutes or so to blend all the flavors well.  Adjust salt,
if desired.

Top with chopped cilantro for garnish if desired.  Serve hot, with
bread as a light main course, or incorporate into a full Indian
dinner.
