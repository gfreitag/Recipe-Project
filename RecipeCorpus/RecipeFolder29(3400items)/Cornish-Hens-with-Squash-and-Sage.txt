Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Onion(s), coarsely chopped
4 c  Acorn squash
-peeled and cubed
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Toasted pumpkin seeds
-or walnut pieces
4    Cornish hens (1 lb ea)
1 ts Dried sage
4 tb Butter, softened
Salt and pepper to taste
8    Garlic clove(s), peeled
12    Sprigs sage or
1 tb Dried sage
1 tb Oil
Heat oven to 400F. Remove any fat from hen cavities; rinse and pat
them pat. Gently loosen the skin from the breast meat and sprinkle
about tsp dried sage over the breasts. Rub each hen with butter,
season generously with salt and pepper, and put 2 cloves of garlic
and 1 sprig of sage (or a pinch of dried sage) in each cavity. Truss
the legs if desired.

Heat the oil in a roasting pan. Cook the onions over medium heat until
lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Off the heat, arrange the squash in
the pan. Scatter the remaining sage over the vegetables. Add the wine
and stock. Arrange the hens, breast side down, on the vegetables.
Cover the pan and cook in the hot oven for about 20 minutes. Remove
the lid, turn the birds breast side up, baste them with a little pan
juice and continue roasting, uncovered, basting a few more times,
until they're golden brown, about 45-55 more.

When done, remove the hens and vegetables; keep warm. Strain the pan
juices and taste. Of thin, boil for a few minutes to concentrate. If
desired, swirl in 1 tbs butter. Adjust the seasoning. Serve the hens
on top of the onions and squash, garnished with pumpkin seeds or
walnuts.
