Remove the heavy stems from the cabbage.  Boil the leaves in a large
saucepan of salted water for 6 minutes and drain.  Pat the leaves dry
on paper towels and leave to one side. To prepare the stuffing, put
the ground pork, beef, rice, onion, garlic, egg, salt and pepper in a
mixing bowl and combine thoroughly.  Put some of this mixture on each
of the cabbage leaves, roll them up, and tuck in the ends to enclose
the stuffing. In another bowl, mix together the sauerkraut, green
pepper, onion, wine and tomato paste.  Stir in the pork. Make a layer
of the sauerkraut mixture in a casserole dish.  Then add a layer of
stuffed cabbage leaves and a bay leaf.  Cover with half the tomato
sauce and repeat the layers. Cover and simmer over low heat for 2
hours. If too much liquid forms, cook without the lid for a while.
Serve from the casserole with an accompaniment of egg nockerl or
boiled potatoes. This dish is even better the second day.
