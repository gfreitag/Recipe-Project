Sorbet:  Pour 1 cup strawberry puree, 2 tblsp. lemon juice, and 1 cup
simple syrup into sorbet or ice cream machine. Blend for 10 minutes.
Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Remove stems from 1 cup fresh strawberries and place in a bowl. Add
1/4 cup whiskey. Set aside to marinate.

Shoelace Pastry:  Place 3/4 cup water in a saucepan set over high
heat. Add 3/4 oz. butter. Stir to melt. Remove from heat and add 1/2
cup flour. Stir to combine. Put back on heat and stir continously
until the dough no longer sticks to the pan or the wooden spoon.
Remove from heat and agressively mix in 2 eggs. Put mixture into
pastry bag and squeeze a dab in each corner of a baking tray. Place
baking paper on tray and press down the corners. (dabs act as an
adhesive) Squeeze a thin line of dough onto paper to resemble a
swan's beak, head, and neck. (sort of an S shape with the bottom
going off in a straight angle instead of a curve up, and a little dab
just after the beginning to form the head) Bake at 400~ for 2 - 3
minutes. Set aside to cool.

Sauvignon Sauce:  Whisk together egg yolks and powdered sugar until a
creamy consistency. Place bowl over a saucepan of pre-heated water
set on medium heat. Add 1/2 cup whiskey and whisk until mixture is
smooth and shiny. Remove from heat and whisk a few minutes more. Set
aside.

To serve place some marinated strawberries (whole or sliced in half)
in a stemmed dessert glass. Add a scoop of strawberry sorbet. Spoon
sauce over sorbet. Slice the apple in long, slender oval slices.
Stick several slices in the sorbet to resemble tail feathers. Stick
swan neck/head (shoelace pastry) in the other side of the sorbet.
Garnish with a fresh mint sprig. (The finished product is very
elegant looking.)
