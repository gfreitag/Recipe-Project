Categories: Salsa/sauce, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
1 sm White truffle, available in
-Italian specialty food
-stores (optional)
1/4 c  Heavy cream
Assorted raw vegetables
1 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Butter
2 cn Anchovy fillets (2 oz. each)
20    Garlic cloves, peeled and
-thinly sliced (about 1/2
-cup)
The Italian Bagna Caoda is one of the most savory, delectable and
unlikely appetizers. It is sort of a fondue (in the original and
proper sense of the word, meaning melted) containing anchovies that
melt in a bath of olive oil and butter and in delicious combination
with the garlic cloves. 20 is an arbitrary number, there could well
be more!

1. Combine the oil, butter, anchovies and garlic in a saucepan. Cook
over a very low heat for about 1 hour. The sauce must barely simmer
as it cooks.

2. Slice the truffle thinly, if used, and add it to the saucepan. Add
cream and simmer about 5 minutes longer. Serve with assorted
vegetables cut into bite-size cubes and lengths.
