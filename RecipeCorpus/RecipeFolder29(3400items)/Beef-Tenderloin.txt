Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1    Garlic clove(s), halved
Lots of freshly ground
-black pepper
1    4-5 lb beef tenderloin
-tied and trimmed
-at room temp
Preheat oven to 500F.

Rub tenderloin all over with the cut garlic. Then rub it liberally
with the pepper. (Save the salt for after the meat is cooked.) Take
note of how thick the meat is.

Place the meat in a roasting pan, stick a meat thermometer in the
meat, and place the pan in the oven. Immediately turn the heat down
to 225F. If you have a thin tenderloin, start checking the
temperature after 30 minutes; if it's a normal-sized tenderloin,
start checking after 50-60 minutes. the thermometer should read 140
degrees for rare meat.

When the meat is done, let it stand for 10 minutes before you cut it.
Pass the salt separately.
