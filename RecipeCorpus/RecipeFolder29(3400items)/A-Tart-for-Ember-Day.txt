Ember Day in Medieval Britain was one of the many days in the year
when the church forbade eating of meat.  Dairy products, eggs, and
fish were allowed.

DIRECTIONS:

Make the pastry and line a 7-8" flan case; bake it blind.  Melt the
butter in a pan and gently cook the onions with the sage and parsley
until they are just soft.  Add the cheese, eggs, seasoning and milk
and mix well. Add the raisins if you are using them and pour the
mixture into the flan case.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees F.)
for approximately 30 minutes or until the tart is risen, firm and
lightly browned
