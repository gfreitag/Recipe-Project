Bring soup to a boil and add watercress.  Reduce heat and simmer for

Let cool to room temperature, cover and refrigerate.  If serving the
soup hot, bring back to a simmer before proceeding.)

Just before serving, stir in the cream, or spoon 1 tablespoon of
cream over each portion.  Serve it hot or cold.
