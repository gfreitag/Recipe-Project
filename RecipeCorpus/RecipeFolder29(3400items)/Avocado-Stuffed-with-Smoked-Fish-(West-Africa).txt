Title: Avocado Stuffed with Smoked Fish (West Africa)
Categories: African, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 lb Smoked whitefish
2 lg Ripe avocados
12    Strips of fresh red bell
-pepper or canned
-pimiento **
4    Hard-cooked eggs *
1/4 c  Milk
1/4 c  Strained fresh lime juice
1/4 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
* the yolks rubbed through a sieve and the whites finely chopped.

** each cut about 1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long.

In a deep bowl, mash the egg yolks and milk together with a spoon or
table fork until they form a smooth paste.  Add 1 tablespoon of the
lime juice, the sugar and the salt.

Then beat in the vegetable oil, a teaspoon or so at a time; make sure
each addition is absorbed before adding more.  Add the olive oil by
teaspoonfuls, beating constantly.  Stir the remaining lime juice into
the sauce and taste for seasoning.

With your fingers or a small knife, remove the skin from the fish and
pick out any bones.  Drop the fish into a bowl and flake it finely
with a fork. Add the chopped egg whites and the sauce, and toss
together gently but thoroughly.

Just before serving, cut the avocados in half.  With the tip of a
small knife, loosen the seeds and lift them out.  Remove any brown
tissue like fibers clinging to the flesh.

Spoon the fish mixture into the avocado halves, dividing it equally
among them and mounding it slightly in the center.  Arrange 3 strips
of sweet pepper or pimiento diagonally across the top of each avocado
and serve at once.

Makes 4 servings.
