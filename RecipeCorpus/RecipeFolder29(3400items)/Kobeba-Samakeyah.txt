Cover the bulgur with water and soak for 30 minutes.

Drain and, a handful at a time, thoroughly squeeze out all
liquid.

Place bulgur, onions, salt and pepper in processor and process
with on-and-off turns until nearly smooth, scraping down sides as
necessary. Transfer to bowl and knead until smooth.  Set aside.

Fish Filling: =============

Steam fish until just cooked.  Flake into small pieces and set
aside.

Heat butter in a small skillet then add onion and scallions and
saute until onion wilts, 3 to 5 minutes.

Stir in flaked fish, cilantro, cumin and salt and pepper,
stirring gently over medium heat 2 minutes.

Set aside and cool completely.

For Tahini Sauce: =================

Place tahini and a 1/2 cup water in processor or blender; blend
until smooth.

Add wine vinegar, garlic and salt and pepper; blend until smooth.

Add enough water to bring sauce to pouring consistency.
Transfer to small bowl and stir in parsley.

Set aside, covered, at room temperature.

To Assemble: ============

To assemble, place small bowl if ice water on work surface. Using
palms, form golf ball-size balls of bulgur mixture.  Dipping fingers
in ice water as you work shape each ball into a hollow tube around
your index finger, gently pressing mixture into small cigar-shaped
tubes about 3 inches long.

Moisten fingers frequently and patch any cracks as you work.

Slip each shell off your finger and fill with about 1 tablespoon
of cooled fish filling using a small spoon.  Press ends of tubes over
fish filling, forming a tight seal.

Cover and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.

Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in large saucepan to 375 F.

Fry kobebas until golden, 4 to 5 minutes, turning once.

Serve immediately with tahini sauce.
