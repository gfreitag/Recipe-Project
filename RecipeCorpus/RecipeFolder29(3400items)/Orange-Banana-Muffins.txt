Preheat oven to 400 F. Grease six 3-inch muffin cups.

In a large bowl, combine the dry (first 8) ingredients. In a small
bowl, combine the liquid ingredients, mixing well. Add the liquids to
the dry ingredients all at once and stir until just moistened. Spoon
the mixture into the muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.

Bake for approx. 25 mins, or until golden and a toothpick inserted in
center of muffin comes out clean.
