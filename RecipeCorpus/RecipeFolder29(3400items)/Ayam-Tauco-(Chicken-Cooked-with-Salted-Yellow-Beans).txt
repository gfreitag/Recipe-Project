Categories: Indonesian, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Paprika (optional)
1/2 ts Chilli powder
1 ts Ground ginger
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Tamarind water
1 c  Water
1 md Roasting chicken
2    Onions
4    Cloves garlic

This recipe calls for 'tauco' which can be either salted black beans
or salted yellow beans.  Either can be found in a Chinese market as
salted black bean or salted yellow bean sauce.  Or you can track down
Indonesian salted yellow beans and smash 'em up yourself.  Thai
markets carry them.

Cut the chicken into serving pieces; wash, and dry.  Slice the onions.
Pound the garlic and the tauco into a smooth paste.

Fry the onions in the oil for half a minute.  Add the tauco, then the
chicken.  Stir well, so that every part of the chicken is coated with
tauco.  Put in the soya sauce and the rest of the ingredients. Cover,
and simmer very gently for 45 minutes.  Then take the lid off, and
cook for a further 5 minutes to reduce the sauce.  Serve hot.

Makes 4 servings.
