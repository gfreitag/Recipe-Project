In a medium-sized bowl, combine the lemon juice, soy sauce, ginger,
and garlic. Add the chicken and marinate for at least 1 hour. Remove
the chicken from the marinade, reserving the liquid.

Heat the oil in a wok and saute the chicken quickly, just until it
loses its pink color. Add the onion and celery and stir a min, then
add the snow peas, bell pepper, and daikon and stir a min or two
more. Add the bok choy, chicken stock, and marinade, allow to simmer
about 2 mins. The vegetables should remain crisp. Make a smooth paste
of the water and cornstarch and add to the wok, stirring constantly,
until the sauce begins to thicken.

Remove from heat and season as desired with salt and pepper.

Serve with white or brown rice.
