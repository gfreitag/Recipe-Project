Put the flour in a bowl and add sugar and mix.

Beat in eggs one at a time and, when they are incorporated and
the dough is smooth, add milk to make a batter.

Dip a ladle or a mold into the hot fat briefly and dip into the
batter.  Put the ladle back into the fat carefully and fry until a
"basket" comes away from the ladle.  Fry the basket until it's golden
and drain.

Fit the genoise into the bottom of each basket.

Drop peaches one at a time into boiling water for 10 seconds to
loosen the skin, then peel, halve and remove the pit.  Place a peach
half on each genoise.

Form "handles" for the "baskets" out of Pate a Choux and bake
them, then secure to the baskets with thick chocolate icing.

Top each peach with sabayon and garnish with candy flowers.

Sabayon: ========

Whisk egg yolks with sugar until they are light and
lemon-colored.

Add Grand Marnier and continue whisking.  Put the mixture over
low heat and cook carefully.

Add warm water in a stream and whisk to form a smooth
light-yellow sauce.
