Title: White Bean Chili (opt. Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree, Chili, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
Stock
2    Bay leaves
1/2 lb Tomatillos, cleaned &
Quartered
1 c  Fresh cilantro, coarsely
Chopped
1 ea Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Fresh lime juice
1 c  Chopped green onions
1 ea Optional - ff sour cream
1 lb White beans (like great
Northerns)
2 lg Onions, diced
2 tb Ground cumin
1 tb Chili powder
1 ts Poultry seasoning
2    To 4 oz cans diced green
Chiles
1    8 oz can salsa verde
(optional)
7 c  "chicken-like" or veggie
Soak beans overnight or use quick soak method (bring beans and water
to cover by 1" to a boil for 5 min. Turn off heat and cover. Let sit
1 hour, then proceed). Pour off soaking water and cover beans with
fresh water and bring to full boil. Lower heat and simmer. While
beans simmer, in a large soup kettle or dutch oven, saute onions
using your favorite ff method (I use a little stock), when
translucent, add cumin, chili pd, poultry seasoning, green chiles and
salsa verde. Saute for 5 minutes, adding a little stock if it begins
to stick. Then add the rest of the stock, bay leaves, tomatillos and
3/4 c cilantro. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered while beans
continue to cook. When beans are just tender (1-2 hours) add them to
the soup pot and simmer everything together for another 1/2 hour.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, add the
rest of the cilantro and the lime juice, stir to blend. Ladle into
big bowls and top with green onions and an optional dollop of ff sour
cream.
