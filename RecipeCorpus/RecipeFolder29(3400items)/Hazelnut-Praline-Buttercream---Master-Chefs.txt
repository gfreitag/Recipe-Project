Title: Hazelnut Praline Buttercream - Master Chefs
Categories: Basics, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  Butter, unsalted, at
-- room temperature
4 oz Hazelnut Praline Paste *
1 c  Milk
4    Egg yolks
1/3 c  Sugar, plus
1 tb Sugar
Place a medium bowl in a larger bowl of ice water.  Set Aside.

Bring milk to the boiling point in a heavy saucepan over medium
heat.

Meanwhile, beat egg yolks in a large mixer bowl until smooth.
Gradually add 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sugar and continue berating
until the mixture is pale yellow and forms a ribbon when beaters are
lifted (about 7 minutes.)

Gradually add boiling milk to yolk mixture, beating constantly to
avoid the yolk curdling.  Return the mixture to the saucepan, and
cook over low heat - stirring with a wooden spoon, for 30 seconds.
Immediately pour custard into the bowl set over ice water.

Cool, stirring occasionally.

Beat the butter and praline paste in a large bowl until smooth
and creamy.  Gradually beat in cooled custard.
