Cream the butter and shortening in the large bowl of an electric
mixer on low speed for 5 minutes.  Add the granulated sugar, light
and dark brown sugars; beat for 3 minutes on moderate speed.  Beat in
the egg and egg yolk.  Blend in the vanilla extract and almond
extract. On low speed, add the sifted mixture and mix until the

Bake the cookies for 15 minutes, or until a light golden color. After
1 minute, transfer the cookies to cooling racks using a wide metal
spatula. Cool completely.
