Categories: Diabetic, Potato, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1    Egg; lightly beaten
2 ts Milk;
1/4 c  All-purpose flour;
5 qt Boiling water;
5 md Potatoes; (about 1-1/2 lbs)
1 ts Salt; (optional)
1/3 c  All-purpose flour; -=OR=-
1/3 c  Bread flour
Peel the potatoes, then boil them until they are very soft, about 40
minutes.  Let potatoes cool, then put them through ricer.  In a large
saucepan, bring  5 fresh quarts of water to boil.  In a mixing bowl,
combine the riced potatoes, salt, 1/3 cup bread flour, lightly beaten
egg, and milk.  Mix with a wooden spoon (a wooden spoon helps develop
the gluten in the flour) until you have a smooth paste.  Use 1/4 cup
flour to dust your hands as you work to keep them from getting
sticky. Then form the mixture into 12 to 14-inch balls.  These are
the dumplings. Carefully drop the dumplings into the boiling water a
few at a time. Don't crowd them or they will lose their shape.  Let
the water come back to a gentle boil. Don't stir the water while the
dumplings are in it. Keep water simmering into the boiling water a
few at a time. Don't crowd them or they will lose their shape.  Let
the water come back to a gentle boil. Then do the next batch. (Tasty
served with goulash.) ONE SERVING: 2 dumplings. Food Exchanges per
