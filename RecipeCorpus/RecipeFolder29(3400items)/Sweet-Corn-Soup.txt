Mince chicken finely in a food processor . Put into a bowl.  Prepare
the marinade : Add salt, soy sauce, pepper and wine to chicken.
Sprinkle corn starch on chicken and stir in the water 1 tbsp at a
time, until the chicken becomes a smooth paste.  Let stand 15 minutes
to blend the oils. Roughly chop the sweet corn kernels in a food
processor or blender. ( They can be left whole if you desire ) In a
small bowl, beat the eggs lightly with the salt and oil.  Set aside.
Pour the marinade into a large saucepan and add the cold water
gradually, stirring with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in the
sweet corn kernels and cream style sweet corn. Bring the soup mixture
to just below boiling point over moderate heat, stirring
occassionally. Combine about 6 tbsp of the hot soup liquid with the
chicken paste, breaking up any lumps. Add to the rest of the soup,
stirring well, and gradually bring to the boil. Simmer for 1 minute
to make sure the chicken is cooked. Slowly pour in the beaten egg
along the back of a fork, moving the fork in a cirular motion at the
same time. Remove from the heat and cover for 45 seconds, to allow
the egg to set in tender flakes. Give the soup a final stir and then
serve hot. The chicken may be omited entirely and still have a very
satisfying soup. Serves 6 to 8 Yan kits Classic Chinese Cookbook by
