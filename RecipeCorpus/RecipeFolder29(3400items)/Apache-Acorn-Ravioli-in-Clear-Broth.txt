1    Recipe basic Egg Ravioli
-dough
2 ts Kosher salt
1 qt Water
2    Green anaheim chiles
1 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Shelled and finely chopped
-acorns or unsalted

3 oz To 4 oz soft white goat
MMMMM------------------------CLEAR BROTH-----------------------------
-diagonally sliced
1/2 ts Azafran
6 c  Chicken Stock
1    Scallion, green part only,
Roast the chiles then peel, seed, devein and coarsely chop them,

Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat and add the acorns.
Saute 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the green chiles and saute
another minute.  Remove from the ehat, mix together with the goat
cheese and set aside.

Prepare a stencil by cutting  adesign out of a piece of cardboard.
For the ravioli in the photograph, we cfut a stencil 5 inches in
length, 3 inches in height, with 1-inch steps.

Roll out the ravioli dough as thinly as possible.  Fold the dough in
half, place the stencil over the dough and, with a sharp knife, cut
around it. Repeat this process 11 times to make 24 identical pieces
of dough.

Lay 12 cut out pieces of dough on a board and place about 1
tablespoon of the acorn filling in the center of each.  Moisten the
outer edges of each piece of the dough.  Place the other 12 pieces on
top, and press the edges together with your fingers.  If the edges
are slightly uneven, trim them. Set aside.

Add the salt to the water in a wide, large saucepan, and bring to a
boil over high heat.  Add the ravioli and cook 3 minutes, until
tender and translucent around the edges.  Drain and set aside.

Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add the scallions and azafran and simmer, uncovered, over medium-low
heat 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and pour 1 cup of the broth
into each bowl.
Add some ravioli and serve. ****************************
