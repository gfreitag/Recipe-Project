Pick the ripest fruit, break them up, and strew a good handful of slat
among them, let them stand by for a day and a night, boil them with
black pepper, cloves, allspice, a red pepper, and a little onion, or
eschalot; when the tomatoes are reduced to pulp, let them be poured
out to cool in an earthen pan.  When the tomatoes are cold put them
through a coarse sived and bottle them for use.  The coarser parts
may be put with the spice into a jar, and vinegar poured over them.
They will make a good sauce for cold meat, or seasoning for soups and
stews.  Fasten down your bottles with paper dipped in white of egg,
which will exclude the air.

When I make Tomato catsup myself, I allow a table spoonful of strong
vinegar to every quart of juice, but most persons make it without
vinegar. Origin:  The Canadian Settler's Guide, written in 1855
