Title: Barbecued Squid with Hot Dipping Sauce (Squid Sate)
Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Peanuts, finely chopped
Juice of 1 lime
Cayenne to taste
1 ts Sugar
2 lb Squid, cut into rings
1 c  Coconut milk
2    Cloves garlic, chopped
6 tb Fish sauce
No country of origin, but I'm betting on Vietnam this time, mainly
from the dip.

Coconut milk is easily made if you have a blender or food processor.

Boil 1 1/2 cups water.  Pour it over 1 1/2 cups of fresh or dry grated
coconut.  Beat it in the food processor or blender for at least 1
minute. Strain it through a sieve or through cheesecloth.  Marinate
the squid for 1 hour in coconut milk to which you have added the
garlic. Prepare the coals and skewer the squid.

To make the dipping sauce which makes this dish so distinctive,
combine the fish sauce, peanuts, sugar, lime juice and the cayenne.

Grill the squid for about 3 minutes on one side.  When brown, turn
over and barbecue 3 minutes more.

Serve accompanied by the dipping sauce.

This recipe will produce tasty grilled fish if you use firm varieties
such as swordfish, sea bass or halibut, cutting the steaks or fillets
into large squares.

This dish serves 4 to 6 as part of a larger meal.
