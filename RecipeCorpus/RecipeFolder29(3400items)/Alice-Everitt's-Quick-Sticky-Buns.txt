Categories: Countyfairs, Pastry
Yield: 18 servings
MMMMM--------------------------THE BUNS-------------------------------
4 tb Butter
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Granulated Sugar
1 lg Egg
3 1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 pk Active Dry Yeast
3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Water
MMMMM------------------------THE TOPPING-----------------------------
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
1 ts Light Corn Syrup
1 tb Water
12 tb Butter, at room temperature
1 c  Light Brown Sugar, firmly
Packed
3/4 c  Walnuts Or Pecans, chopped
1. In large bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, put 1 1/2 cups of
flour. Add the yeast and blend with whisk. In a saucepan, gently heat
the milk, water, butter, salt and sugar until little bubbles appear
around edge; do not boil. Pour over the flour-yeast mixture. Add the
egg and beat for 30 secs at low speed, scraping bowl constantly. Then
beat 3 mins at medium speed.

2. Gradually add the remaining 1 3/4 cups of flour, beating on low
until flour is absorbed. Scrape the bowl sides. Cover the bowl with
oiled plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 30 to
40 mins or longer.

3. While the dough is rising, prepare the topping. Mix all ingredients
together. Grease a 9 x 13 x 2-inch pan. Spread the topping over
bottom.

4. Punch down dough; it will be sticky. Drop by large spoonfuls onto
the topping; don't worry if the dough balls do not touch; they will
as they rise. Cover with oiled plastic wrap and let rise again in
warm draft-free place until doubled, about 30 mins or longer.

* Preheat oven to 375 F.

5. Bake the buns for 20 to 25 mins. When golden brown, remove and
cool on a rack for 3 mins. Invert the buns onto a tray or baking
sheet. While still warm, cut into 2 x 3 inch portions. Serve, topping
side up, warm or at room temp. They may be reheated.
