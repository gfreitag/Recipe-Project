Title:  COLESLAW
Categories: Salads, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Flour
1 pn Cayenne
1 ts Kosher or sea salt
1/2 c  Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 tb Poppy seeds
1 tb Finely grated horseradish
1/2    Head red cabbage, shredded
1/2    Head green cabbage, shredded
1/4 c  Red onion, sliced very thin
1    Carrot, peeled and shredded
DRESSING:
2    Egg yolks
1 1/2 ts Colman's dry mustard
1/4 c  Sugar
"It's made with an old-fashioned boiled dressing that coats the
shredded vegetables well and stays nice for several hours without
getting watery. Extra dressing will keep well; just cover and
refrigerate."

SALAD:

Combine the cabbage, onion, and carrot in a large bowl and
refrigerate.

In top of a double boiler off heat, combine the yolks with the
mustard, sugar, flour, cayenne, and salt.  Whisk in the vinegar
slowly to insure no lumps.  Place over simmering water and cook,
stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the cream and continue cooking over
simmering water until thick, about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring
constantly.  Cool and add the poppy seeds and horseradish.

Using about half the dressing, dress the cabbage.  Add more if needed
~ you don't want the coleslaw to be too dry, but you don't want it
swimming in dressing either.
