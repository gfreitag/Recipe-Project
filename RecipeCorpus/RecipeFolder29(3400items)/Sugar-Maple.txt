Sugar Maple

In early spring, a long icicle of sap hanging from a broken limb
signals the arrival of the sugaring season. The Iroquois collected
the sap of the sugar maple to drink raw or to boil down into syrup
and sugar. Lightly fermented, the sap was mildly intoxicating;
heavily fermented, it made a prized vinegar. Seneca travelers filled
empty duck eggs with the sugar syrup for a compact energy food. The
Longhouse people still celebrate the gifts of the maple with a feast
of thanksgiving; and the tree occupies a position of respect in their
oral tradition. SOURCE:* The Conservationist Feb. 95, The New York
