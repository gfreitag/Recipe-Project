"My husband and I enjoy this chili often.  I learned to make it in a
high school home economics class.  One thing I like is that it uses
beef stew meat rather than the usual ground beef. And it sure lives
up to its name!" ~ Lori Pfeifer Heat oil in Dutch oven; brown beef on
all sides. Drain well on paper towels. Cook onions and garlic in oil;
return meat to pan. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, sugar,
oregano, chili powder, salt and red pepper.  Bring to a boil over
high heat. Reduce heat; simmer 1 1/2 hours. Add kidney beans and
green and red pepper. Simmer, covered, until meat is tender.
