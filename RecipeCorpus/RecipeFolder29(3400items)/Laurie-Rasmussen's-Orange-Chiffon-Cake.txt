Title: Laurie Rasmussen's Orange Chiffon Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Countyfairs
Yield: 12 servings
8    Eggs -- separated
1/4 c  Cold Water
2 tb Orange Rind * -- grated
1/2 ts Cream Of Tartar
2 c  All-Purpose Flour, Sifted
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking Powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
* By substituting grated lemon rind for the orange, this becomes a
delightful lemon chiffon cake.

* Preheat oven to 325 F.

1. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a big
bowl. Make a well in center. Pour in oil, egg yolks, water and rind
of your choice. Beat at low speed with an electric mixer for 1 min,
or until smooth.

2. In another bowl, and with clean beaters, beat the egg whites with
the cream of tartar at high speed until stiff peaks form.

3. Transfer a scoop of egg white to the flour mixture, and mix it
with a rubber spatula to lighten the batter. Fold in the rest of the
beaten egg whites, until just blended.

4. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Pull a table
knife once thru' the batter to release any air bubbles. Bake in
center of oven for 65 mins, or until top springs back when lightly
touched. Invert the tube pan over the neck of a bottle to cool. When
completely cooled, turn upright and remove the cake.
