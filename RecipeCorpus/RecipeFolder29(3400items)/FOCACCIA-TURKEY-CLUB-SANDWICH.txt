1 ts Italian seasoning
1    (1 lb.) loaf frozen bread
Dough
2 tb Finely chopped onion
Cook the bacon until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Combine the
mayonnaise with cilantro and parsley. Cut each focaccia in half,
forming 4 (8x4-inch) rectangles. Spread half of the mayonnaise on top
of 2 of the focaccia halves. Layer half of the turkey, tomato, bacon,
avocado, and alfalfa sprouts onto each. Spread the bottoms of the
focaccia with more mayonnaise and cover the sandwich fillings. Cut
into halves or thirds.

NOTE: Commercially produced mayonnaise may be substituted. Focaccia
(round or square), purchased at Italian delis, may be used.

FOR MAYONNAISE: Combine the eggs, lemon juice, mustard, and hot pepper
sauce in a blender or food processor. Blend 5 to 10 seconds. With the
blender still running, add the oil in a very slow stream through the
opening in blender cover. Blend until smooth, scraping sides
occasionally for even blending. Season to taste with salt.

FOR FOCACCIA: Allow the bread dough to thaw 2 to 4 hours or overnight
in the refrigerator. Cut dough in half and roll out each half to make
an 8-inch square. If the dough pulls back, let rest 15 to 30 seconds
and roll out again. Place the dough in 2 greased 8-inch square baking
pans. Thoroughly pierce dough at 1-inch intervals with a fork. Saute
the onion and garlic in olive oil until lightly browned. Add the
seasoning and brush the mixture over the dough squares. Let rise 10
minutes. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden
brown. Let cool.
