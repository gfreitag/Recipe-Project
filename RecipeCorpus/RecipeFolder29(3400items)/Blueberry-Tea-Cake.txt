Title: Blueberry Tea Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Fruit
Yield: 1 loaf
-picked over
8 tb Unsalted butter; softened
3/4 c  Superfine sugar
2    Extra-large eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Sour cream
2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 c  Fresh blueberries;
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter and flour a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.

Sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
nutmeg and cinnamon.  Toss the blueberries with 1 tablespoon of the
sifted mixture.

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on moderately
high speed for 3 minutes.  Add the sugar and beat for 2 minutes. Beat
in the eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition. Beat
in the vanilla extract.  On low speed, add half of the sifted
ingredients, mixing until the particles of flour are absorbed.  Stir
in the blueberries.

Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the loaf for
55 minutes to 1 hour, or until nicely risen and a wooden pick
inserted into the loaf emerges clean and dry.  The baked loaf will
pull away slightly from the sides of the pan.

Cool the loaf in the pan on a rack for 3 to 4 minutes, invert onto
another rack and turn rightside up.  Cool completely.  Store in an
airtight container.
