A simple, colorful and wonderfully delicious way of serving noodles.

Boil the noodles in plenty of salted water. Drain well. Melt the
butter in a heavy bottomed pot. Add the poppy seeds and fry until the
seeds start to change color and emit a pleasant nutty smell. Add the
drained noodles, mix well, season and heat through. Serve hot
sprinkled with parsley.
