Categories: Basics, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 4 servings
Salt (to taste)
Pepper, white (to taste)
2 tb Butter, clarified **
Oil, Olive
2 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Water, or more
1 c  Flour, all purpose, sifted

For Crepes: ===========

Combine the eggs, milk and a 1/2 cup of water together.
Gradually add 1 cup of flour, whisking it in until smooth.

Whisk in the salt and pepper and Clarified butter.  Thin with
water, if necessary, to the consistency of whipping cream.  Cover and
refrigerate for several hours or overnight.

If the crepe batter has thickened in the refrigerator, thin it
with water to the consistency of whipping cream.  Brush a 7-inch
skillet (preferably non stick) with a thin film of olive oil.  Place
the skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, add about 3 tablespoons
of crepe batter and swirl to coat the pan.  Cook until the crepe is
lightly golden, about 1 minute; then turn it over and cook the second
side for 30 seconds. Continue with remaining batter, stacking crepes
between waxed paper.
