Title: Scalloped Potatoes with Canadian Bacon
Categories: Casseroles
Yield: 5 servings
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Thyme leaves; dried
1/2 ts Basil; dried
1/2 ts Mustard; dried
1/8 ts Ground white pepper
1/8 ts Salt
7 c  Red potatoes; thinly sliced
1    Onion; chopped
1 cl Garlic; minced
6 oz Canadian bacon; in strips
2 tb Cornstarch
2 c  Milk; 2%
Preheat the oven to 350.  Spray 2 1/2 qt casserole with Pam.  Combine
the potatoes, onions and garlic in the casserole.  Stir to mix well.
Cover with wax paper and microwave on high for 10 to 13 minutes, or
until partially cooked; twice during the cooking time, give a quarter
turn and stir. Add the canadian bacon and mix well.  While the
vegetables are cooking, place the cornstarch in a medium saucepan.
Gradually add the milk, stirring vigorously until smooth.  Stir in
the bay leaf, thyme, basil, mustard, pepper and salt.  Bring to a
simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat and
cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens. Reduce the heat to low.
Cook, stirring, for 1 minute longer. Pour the sauce over the potato
mixture and stir well. Cover and bake for 20 minutes. Stir well and
make sure the bay leaf is visible for easy removal later.  Cover and
bake for another 10 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
If a crusty top is desired, do not re-cover after stirring.  Remove
and discard the bay leaf.  Allow the casserole to stand for about 5
minutes before serving. 369 calories and 5 grams fat. Source:  100%
