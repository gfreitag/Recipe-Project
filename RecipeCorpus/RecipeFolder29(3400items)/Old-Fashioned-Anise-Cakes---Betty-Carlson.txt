3. Beat in the flour until the dough is very stiff. Cool, then roll
thin (about 1/4 inch thick) and press with mold. (see below). Cut
along imprint lines to separate cookies. Cover with tea towels and
let rest over night, to rise. Next morning, transfer to greased or
parchment-lined baking sheets and bake in 350 F oven about 15 mins,
or until set. The cakes should be very pale on top and light brown on
the bottom.

Notes from Betty Carlson: This recipe came from her grandmother, Hilda
Baker Mark (1878-1938). The press she and her mother used was a
handcarved wooden rectangle from Germany. You can now buy rolling
pins made for this purpose.
