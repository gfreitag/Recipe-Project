Title: Bruce's Bodacious Bean Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings (
1 ts Tarragon
2    Bay Leaves
1    Vegie Stock Cube
1 ds {Veg} Worcestershire Sauce
1 ds Mushroom Soy, or Tamari.
1    Carrot
1    Potato
2 c  Mushrooms
1    Onion
3    Garlic Cloves
1 c  Cabage
1/2 c  Dried Soya Beans
1/2 c  Dried Green Lentils
1/2 c  Dried Green Split Peas
1/2 c  Dried Yellow Slit Peas
1/2 c  Adzuki or Kidney Beans
1/2 c  Lima or Cannalini Beans
1/2 c  Mung beans
1/2 c  Pearl Barley
200 g  Tofu
1 ts Mustard Powder
2 ts Thyme
Any selection of beans will do, mix and match as you will.  But this
is a nice selection.  All measurements and yield estimations are {way}
approximate.  Soak all the beans for a day or so.  Put 'em in in the
morning, they'll be fine to cook with that night.

Thinly (5 mm, approx.) slice the Tofu, and fry in Olive Oil 'till
brown. Pour on Mushroom soy, stir around, remove from heat. Set
aside. Slice and dice all the vegies. Fry up the onion, garlic and
mustard in heaps of olive oil, chuck in the herbs and the stock cube,
then all the beans and enough water to cover it all comfortably.
Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and keep on a rolling boil till
the buggers are soft, probably an hour or so. Check 'em with your
teeth. When they're nearly edible, chuck in all the vegies, cook for
another twenty minutes or so, depending on how mushy you like your
vegies, then add the tofu. Give it a couple of minutes more, then
scoff the lot.
