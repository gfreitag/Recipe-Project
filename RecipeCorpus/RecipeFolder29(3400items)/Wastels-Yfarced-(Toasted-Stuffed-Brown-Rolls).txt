Wastels were good quality loaves served to the gentry at a late
medieval feast.

Put halved loaves in moderately hot oven for approximately 10 minutes
or till they are lightly browned and crisp.

Melt the butter in a pan and cook the mushrooms for a couple of
minutes. Add the spinach and the raisins and continue to cook gently
for several minutes, or until the butter has been almost absorbed by
the veggies. Season to tast with the salt, pepper, and spices.  Beat
the egg in a bowl, add to the veggie mixture and cook it gently just
long enough for the egg to slightly bind with the other ingredients.
Pile the filling into the halved loves and serve at once.
