Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 6 SERVINGS--------------------------
-(reserve the
Soaking liquid)
450 ea G/ 1 lb dried figs, soaked,
-drained and minced
Powder for mixture made with 1/8 teaspoon each ground ginger and
cloves, pinch of black pepper 1/4 teaspoon dried saffron strands
moistened with fig soaking liquid 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 egg, separated,
and 1 egg white 6-7 sheets filo or strudel pastry Oil for frying
About 225 ml/8 fl oz/1 cup warmed clear honey (optional) In a food
processor combine the minced figs, spices and saffron, salt and egg
yolk. Beat the egg whites until liquid. Lightly brush the top sheet
of pastry with egg white. Mark the short side of the pastry sheet at
7.5 cm/3-inch intervals. Then cut the sheet into strips 7.5
cm/3-inches wide. Put a dab of fig mixture on the end of one sheet
and roll the strip up like a mini-Swiss roll. Pinch the ends to seal
in the fig mixture. Repeat this process until you have used all the
fig mixture; remember to brush every pastry sheet with egg white
before cutting it into strips. Fry the rolls, a few at a time, in
deep or shallow oil as you prefer. Serve them with warmed honey
spooned over if you like a very sweet sauce. (The old recipe tells
you to baste the rolls with the honey, so you may be meant to finish
processing the rolls like Crepes Suzette.) from The Medieval Cookbook
