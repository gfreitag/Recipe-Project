Title: Jay's Cheesecake
Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 ts Lemon juice
2 lb Cream cheese
1    Stick Sweet Butter
4    Eggs
1 pt Sour cream
This cheesecake has no crust.  "It's so rich and delicious it doesn't
need one."

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Leave cream cheese and butter out for a
while until soft or melt them in a double boiler. Beat (in a large
bowl) the cream cheese, then add the butter, eggs, sugar, flour, sour
cream, vanilla and lemon juice. Beat this mixture well until it is
smooth (at a medium to fast speed, this will take a long time but it
is worth it!) Put the mixture into a greased pan (9" or 10" diameter
by 2" or 3" high) Bake in the oven for 1 hour at 325 degrees then
turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in it for 2 hours (slow
cooling) Put in fridge until cold.

Helpful hints:  1.  Use a springform pan if you have one.
2.  Cut the cheesecake with dental floss (no kidding).
