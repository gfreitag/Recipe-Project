9. Meanwhile, prepare Parsley-Basil Sauce (recipe follows). To cook
ravioli, bring 3 or 4 inches water to boiling in a 5-quart kettle.
Add oil and then half the ravioli, and cook 4 to 5 minutes (longer if
ravioli were refrigerated) or until the pasta is just tender. With
slotted spoon, remove ravioli; drain well and place on tray. Repeat
with the remaining ravioli

10. To serve, cover warm serving plates with a thin layer of sauce;
for appetizers, arrange 3 ravioli over sauce and garnish with some
slivered dried tomatoes, if desired. Pass around any extra sauce to
serve with Ravioli

Parsley-Basil Sauce: In heavy 2-quart saucepan, melt 1/3 C  butter
over medium heat. Add 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped, and saute just
until golden. Stir in 1/3 C unsifted all-purpose flour, 1/2 t salt,
and 1/4 t ground black pepper; cook until bubbly. Gradually stir in 1
1/4 C chicken broth and heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Stir in
1 C milk until well combined. Remove sauce from heat; pour into
blender. Add 2 C lightly packed fresh Italian parsley leaves and 1 C
lightly packed fresh basil leaves. Blend until sauce turns green and
herbs are ground, stopping blender frequently to scrape container.
Return sauce to saucepan; heat over low heat just until hot. Do not
boil. Stir in 1/2 C grated Parmesan cheese and keep warm.

Makes 8 appetizer or 4 main dish servings.
