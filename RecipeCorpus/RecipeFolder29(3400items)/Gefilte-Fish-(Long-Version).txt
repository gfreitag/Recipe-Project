GEFILTE FISH
....................................................................
There are literally hundreds of ways of making this popular dish.
What they all agree on is that the mixture should contain more than
one kind of fish. The most widely used proportion is 2/3 of lean
white sea fish, such as cod, whiting or haddock, to 1/3 freshwater
fish, such as carp or pike, etc. In Israel, "gefilte fish" is mostly
made with carp. Carp, especially when mixed with pike, gives a firmer
texture amd a more intense flavor. The color of gefilte fish is also
disputed. Some people tint it with onion skin to color it brown while
others use tumeric or saffron to make it yellow. The recipe given
below is an almagamation of many recipes. It can me made into round
or flat dumplings or served in the traditional way - stuffed into the
skin of the fish.

FOR THE STOCK:

x  Head, Bones and Skin of Fish

TO PREPARE THE STOCK: Wash the fish heads, bones and skins carefully
and place in a large pot. Add the vegetables and just enough water to
cover. Bring to the boil, skim and reduce the heat. Simmer gently for
about 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper. At this stage the fish heads
and bones can be discarded, though this is not traditionally done. TO
PREPARE THE FISH: The best way is to chop it in a wooden bowl with
the help of a chopping blade which is known as "hachoir", or "hack
messer", in Yiddish. The action of chopping incorporates air into the
mixture making it light and fluffy. If the preparation is done by
hand, combine the fish and onions and chop them until a fine,
homogenous mixture is achieved, moistening it frequently with a few
drops of very cold water. Otherwise, the fish and theonion can be
either minced or processed. Sometimes the onions are slightly sweated
in a little oil to soften their flavor before they are added to the
fish mixture. Mix the rest of the ingredients together. ** If the
mixture is too soft, add some more matzoh meal. Allow the mixture to
rest for at least 30 minutes in a cold place. Form the balls into
either 1 1/2 inch (4 cm) or into torpedo-shaped patties. Slide them
into the boiling liquid. Reduce the heat and simmer, half covered,
for one hour. *** Switch off the heat and allow the fish to reach
room temeperature in the liquid. Lift the fish onto a serving dish
and decorate each dumpling with a slice of cooked carrot. Boil the
gravy to reduce it, and chill until almost jelled. Spoon some over
the decorated balls. Chill and serve with the remaining gravy handed
around in a sauce boat. Although this dish can be eaten hot, it is
usually served cold, accompanied by "chrain" a beetroot or
horseradish sauce.

TO STUFF A WHOLE FISH:

1 lg Carp (about 1 to 1 1/2 kg/2-3 lb), when boned and skinned this
will yield about 500g/1 lb of meat. Add other fish as before to make
1 1/2kg/3 lb and proceed to make as described as above. x Parsley
Sprigs; to garnish Buy the carp whole. Wash it well and rub plenty of
salt to get rid of the slimy mucous on its skin. Wash away the salt
well, scale the fish and dry it with paper towels. Lay the carp on a
chopping board.
