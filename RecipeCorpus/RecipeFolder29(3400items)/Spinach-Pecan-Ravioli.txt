Place the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly add the water,
mixing until the douh becomes stif enough to knead. Use only as much
water as necessary to make an elastic dough. Knead the dough for 10
minutes, form into a ball, cover and let stand at room temperature
for 1 hour.

Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and cook, covered,
until golden. Turn of the heat. Add the garlic and mix well. Add the
spinach, salt and pepper, cover and cook until the spinach is wilted.
Remove the cover, add the chopped pecans, and cook until all the
liquid has evaporated.

Cut the dough into two sections. On a floured board, roll the dough
into a thin rectangle. Set aside. Do the same with the second part of
the dough.

Place small mounds of filling, about 1 tsp, 1 1/2 inches apart on one
dough rectangle. Press down with the side of your little finger
between the mounds.
With a knife or pastry cutter, cut into individual ravioli. If a
knife was used, seal the edges by pressing lightly with the tines of
a fork.

Line up the ravioli on a floured towel.

In a large pot, boil 7 quarts of water containing 1/2 tsp salt and 1
tbs olive oil. The water should continue boiling rapidly. Place the
ravioli in the water one at a time and cook for 10 minutes. Gently
remove from the water with a slotted spoon and place in a colander to
drain. Transfer to a large warm bowl and cover with tomato sauce,
making sure that the sauce coats each ravioli.
