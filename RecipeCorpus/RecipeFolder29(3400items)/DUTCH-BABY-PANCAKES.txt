PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the
center of the oven. Have a 10-inch glass pie plate or cast iron
skillet ready. Mix the milk, flour, eggs, sugar and vanilla until
smooth, in a food processor, blender or with a whisk. The batter can
be made a day ahead and refrigerated. Put the butter in the pie plate
or skillet and place in the hot oven until the butter is melted.
Brush the butter up the sides and onto the rim of the pan so the
entire inside surface is well coated. Slowly pour the batter into the
pie plate or skillet and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven to 350F
and continue baking until the pancake is well browned and cooked in
the center, 8 to 10 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and sift
confectioners' sugar over the top. Serve immediately, with fruit
spooned into the center or with lemon wedges.
