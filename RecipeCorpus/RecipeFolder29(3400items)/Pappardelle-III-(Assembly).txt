** Recipes for Pappardelle I Pasta, and Pappardelle II Duck
should have been completed before this recipe is started.

To Assemble: ============

Have the warm duck sauce standing by.

Cut the dough into 3 pieces.  Roll out 1 piece of dough on a
lightly floured board to a thickness of 1/16 inch.  Starting from end
nearest you, roll dough around and around a rolling pin until it's
all rolled up. Cut dough down length of rolling pin, then cut into
pappardelle strips about 1 x 5 inches.  Repeat with remaining 2
pieces of dough.

Place pappardelle on tray lined with floured cloth and let dry
briefly, uncovered, in refrigerator.

Meanwhile, bring 5 quarts water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon of
salt.

Add pasta gradually, stirring with wooden spoon.  Boil
vigorously, uncovered, until just tender, 2 to 4 minutes.  Drain well.

Immediately return the pasta to the empty pot with half of the
sauce and 1/4 cup Parmesan, tossing gently over medium heat.

Serve immediately on heated plates, topping with remaining sauce.
Additional Parmesan and a pepper mill should be made available at the
table.
