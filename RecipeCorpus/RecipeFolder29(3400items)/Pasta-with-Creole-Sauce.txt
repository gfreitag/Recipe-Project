By Mark Hill:  "This tomato-based sauce is very spicy. The cayenne
pepper is not meant to give it heat, but to contribute to the overall
balance of flavors.  This sauce is also delicious served over rice."

If you are using cooked beans omit this step.  Sort and rinse the
beans, then soak overnight in water.  Drain and cook the kidney beans
in a separate pot with 5 cups of water and 4 bay leaves.  Cook for
1-1/2 hours until tender.  When the kidney beans are done, remove the
bay leaves, drain, and set aside.

In another pot, braise the onions in the red wine.  When the onions
are soft, add the green pepper.  Before the peppers are completely
softened, add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano, thyme, and 2 bay leaves.
Stew all of this together for 20 to 25 minutes.  Add the kidney
beans, cayenne, and rice wine vinegar.  Stir, then add salt and
pepper to taste.

Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling water, according to package
directions without using salt, until al dente--tender but firm to the
bite. Drain. Top with creole sauce.

Variation:  Add 1 teaspoon Ancho Chili Puree with the tomatoes.

Note:  To make Ancho Chili Puree, remove the seeds and soak 1 dried
ancho chili in water for about 1 hour until it is soft and plump. Use
enough water to cover the chili.  Drain it and reserve the liquid.
Place the chili in a food processor or blender and puree. Add
whatever reserved liquid is necessary to give the puree a smooth
consistency and to yield 1 tablespoon of puree.  It should not
require more than a little water.
