Paneer is soft white 'farmer' cheese that is commonly used in India.
I substituted reduced-fat White Wave tofu, and it takes the place of
paneer very well. This takes about 1/2 hour to make.

start some rice

cut 1 brick tofu into cubes and bake in 300 degree oven while you
prepare sauce.

1 onion (slice very thinly and saute in your favorite medium until
browned) 1 t. pressed garlic (in with the onion)

1 c. water 1 t. ginger 1 T. cumin 1 T. coriander 1/2 t. clove 1/4 t.
methi (fenugreek) 1 t. salt

add spices to onion/garlic at last minute of saute.  Stir until
distributed and then add water.

mix: 2 t. gram flour (chickpea flour, besan) enough water to make a
thin, smooth paste

add a family size package of frozen green peas to the sauce, and cook
until hot.

dribble in the chickpea flour mixture, while stirring.  The sauce will
thicken.

add: 1 cup of ground tomatoes or tomato puree juice of one lemon

stir, adjust seasonings.

Add tofu and simmer until it absorbs some of the seasonings.  Add more
water if necessary.

serve with rice
