Title: Fudgy Bat Cookies
Categories: Kids, Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 3 dozen
4 oz Milk chocolate candy melts
9 oz Chocolate wafer cookies
Use a serrated knife to carefully cut 18 of the cookies into
quarters. Save remaining cookies for another use.  For each bat,
place 2 cookie quarters 1/4" apart on waxed paper. Repeat with
remaining quarters. Melt candy melts.  Drop about 1/2 teaspoon of
melted candy at center of each bat, connecting cookies.  Use a
toothpick to smooth melted candy into a uniform circle.  Cool
completely before removing from waxed paper. Source: Gifts That Taste
