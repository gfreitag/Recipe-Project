Title: Fig and Raisin 'Cream'
Categories: Fruit, Medieval
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 6 SERVINGS--------------------------
1/8 ts Ground cloves
Soft dark brown sugar to
-taste
3 ts Rice flour or cornflour
A drop or two of red food
-colouring
Salt to taste
4 oz Well-soaked dried
-figs
4 oz Stoned raisins
1 1/4 c  Red wine (not to dry_
Good pinch of ground black
-pepper
1/3 ts Ground cinnamon
Drain the figs, reserving the soaking liquid.  Discard the stalk ends
of the fruit and put them in a saucepan with the raisins and wine.
Add the spices and a teaspoon of sugar and bring to the boil.  Take
off the heat and cool slightly, then turn the mixture into an
electric blender and process until smooth.  Add a little of the
soaking water if the mixture is stubbornly solid. Cream the rice
flour or cornflour with a little more soaking water or wine and
brighten the tint with a drop of food colouring. Blend the 'cream'
into the dried-fruit puree. Then return the whole mixture to the
saucepan and simmer until it thickens slightly. Season with salt and
a little extra sugar if you wish. The mixture can be served hot or
cold over a sweet cereal dish, firm stewed fruit or - best of all-
ice cream. Some versions in other manuscripts are stiffer and make a
good filling for tartlets or fried puffs. One encloses the filling in
pastry to make dumplings. from The Medieval Cookbook by Maggie Black
