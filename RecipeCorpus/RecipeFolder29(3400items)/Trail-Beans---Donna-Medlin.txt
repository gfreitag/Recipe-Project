Title: Trail Beans - Donna Medlin
Categories: Countyfairs, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
-about 4 Inches Long,
-stemmed and crushed
1 md Onion, slice thin
2 ts Salt
2 c  Dried Pinto Beans
6 c  Water
3 oz Lean Salt Pork Piece,
-Rind Removed
4    Dried Hot Red Chiles,
1. Rinse the beans under cold running water; discard any "blems". Put
the beans in a large pot and cover with water by 2 inches. Bring to a
boil, boiling for 2 mins, remove from heat and let soak 1 hour.

2. Drain and rinse the beans and return them to the pot. Add the 6
cups of water, the salt pork, the chiles, and the onion. Bring to
boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 hours, covered. Check from time to
time, add boiling water if necessary. (Cold water toughens the beans.)

3. Stir in the salt and simmer 30 mins, or until a bean can be easily
mashed against the side of the pot. The beans should have absorbed
most of the liquid. Serve with a fresh tomato salsa, if desired.
