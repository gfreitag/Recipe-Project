This is excellent for making Easter eggs but you can also make candy
bars by patting candy into a square on waxed paper, cutting into bars
and dip in chocolate.

* buy invert sugar at cake and decorating stores.

In a small saucepan, combine invert sugar, fruit and nuts.  Stir and
boil for 2-3 minutes; drain, reserving liquid.

Combine liquid, sugar, corn syrup, salt and water in a 2-quart
saucepan. Cover tightly and bring to a boil. Uncover and place a
candy thermometer in pan; cook to 250 degrees.

Pour candy out on a marble slab and cool to lukewarm. Work candy with
spatula until it is opaque.  Add vanilla and marshmallow creme.
Continue to paddle candy until creamy. Add prepared fuit and nuts;
knead into candy. Form into egg shapes and let stand a couple of
hours.  Dip in chocolate.

Makes 16 medium-size eggs.
