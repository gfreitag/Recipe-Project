MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1 1/2 ts Basil, dried, crushed
2 ts Oregano, dried, crushed
1 1/2 ts Cumin, ground
1 ts Allspice, ground
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Tabasco sauce
1    Bay leaf
1 cn Beer (12 oz.)
3/4 c  Cashews or peanuts
1 c  Cheddar cheese, shredded
(Monterey Jack or Colby work
-fine also)
2 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Celery, chopped
1 1/2 c  Green pepper, chopped
2 cn Tomatoes, cut up (or stewed
-tomatoes)(26 oz. cans)
3 cn Red kidney beans, rinse and
-drain (16 oz. cans)
1/2 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1 tb Parsley, chopped
2 tb Chili powder
2 ts Cumin
2 ts Salt
Heat oil in 4-5qt pot. Add ingredients from section one, cooking with
cover until tender but not browned. Stir in undrained tomatoes, and
all the ingredients in section 2. Simmer for 1-2 hours. 30 minutes
before serving stir in beer and nuts and simmer uncovered until it's
the desired consistency. Sprinkle cheese on each serving.

For some reason I have met up with strange looks and "Raisins in
chili?" when I told in advance what I used to make it. Peanuts are
less expensive than cashews so I use either. As usual season to
taste, this is a mild version for a starting point. I have also made
the same chili and added 1 1/2lb browned ground beef without changing
any of the above.
