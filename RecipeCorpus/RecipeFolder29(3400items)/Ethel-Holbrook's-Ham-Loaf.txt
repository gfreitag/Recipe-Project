1/2 c  Packed Brown Sugar
1 ts Dry Mustard
1/2 c  Pineapple Juice
1    Egg

* Preheat oven to 375 F.

1. Beat the egg and milk together; soak the bread in the milk mix for
10 mins or longer.

2. Combine the meats with the soaked bread, salt and pepper, mix well
but gently so you don't compress the meat too much. Put into a
greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan.

juice together. Spread this paste over the loaf. Bake 1 1/2 to 2
hours, until top is brown and bubbling. Serves 6 to 8.
