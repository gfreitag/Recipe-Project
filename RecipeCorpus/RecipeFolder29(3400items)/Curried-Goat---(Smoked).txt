NOTE: Be CAREFUL when handling Habaneros or Scotch Bonnets!

The night before you plan to barbecue, prepare the paste in a food
processor. First process the onions, curry, garlic, salt and habaneros
until finely chopped. Then add the oil, processing until the mixture
forms a thick paste. This can be done in two batches if needed.

Wearing rubber gloves, rub the paste over the goat, covering the
meat evenly. Place the goat in a plastic bag and refrigerate
overnight.

Before you begin to barbecue, remove the goat from the
refrigerator and let it sit, covered, at room temperature for 45
minutes.

Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200
to 220 degrees F.

If you plan to baste the meat...mix together the mop ingredients
in a saucepan and warm the liquid over low heat.

Transfer the goat to the smoker. Cook for about 1-1/4 hours per
pound of weight for each quarter. The forequarters will be done
earlier than the hindquarters, which may take 10 hours or longer,
depending on size. In a wood-burning pit, turn the meat and drizzle
the mop over it every 30 minutes. In other styles of smokers, baste
as appropriate and turn the meat at the same time.

When the meat is done, remove it from the smoker, and allow it to
sit for 15 minutes before serving. Slice or shred the meat and serve
with... [your favorite barbecue sauce].
