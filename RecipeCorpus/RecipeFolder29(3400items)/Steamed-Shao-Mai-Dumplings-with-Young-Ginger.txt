Categories: Breads, Chinese, Masterchefs
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Wine, Chinese, rice OR
2 ts Sherry, dry
1 ts Oil, sesame
1/4 ts Salt, kosher
Pepper (to taste)
1/4 c  Waterchestnuts, fresh,
-- diced
3 tb Carrots, diced
16 ea Wrappers, shao-mai, thin
-- (stamped out of thin
-- wonton wrappers)
1 ea Ginger, fresh,
-- walnut-sized piece
1 ea Scallion, thin, cut into
-- 1-inch lengths
1/2 lb Pork butt, ground
1 tb Sauce, soy
Mince the ginger and scallion in a food processor until fine.

Add pork, soy sauce, wine, sesame oil, salt and pepper and mix
with several on-off pulses in the processor.

Scrape the mixture into a bowl, and add the water chestnuts.
Stir in one direction until mixed.

Put 1 scant tablespoon of filling in the center of each wrapper.
form the wrapper into a loose four-cornered hat, then press each
corner towards the filling.  The dumpling should now look like a
cupcake.

Next, make a circle of your thumb and first finger around the
middle of the dumpling and tighten the circle gently to press the
wrapper to the filling and give the dumpling an empire "waist".

Dunk the exposed pork top into carrot cubes to decorate.

Steam the dumplings for 20 minutes on an oiled steamer rack and
serve.
