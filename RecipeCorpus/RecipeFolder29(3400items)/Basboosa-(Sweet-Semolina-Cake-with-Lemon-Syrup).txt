Categories: Middle east, Cake/cookie, Syrups
Yield: 1 8x12 flat
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
2 tb Lemon juice, fresh
1/4 ts Rose water, bottled
1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
3/4 c  Cold water; (« to 3/4 c)
20    Blanched almonds, whole;
;split in half lengthwise
12 tb Butter; unsalted, melted and
;cooled
3 c  Semolina, yellow
3 c  Sugar
First prepare the syrup in the following fashion:  combine 1 « cups
of water, 1 cup of sugar and the lemon juice in a small saucepan.
Stirring constantly, cook over moderate heat until the sugar
dissolves. Increase the heat to high and cook briskly, uncovered and
undisturbed, for 5 minutes (timing it from the moment the syrup
boils), or until the syrup reaches a temperature of 220 degrees (F)
on a candy thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the
rose water and set the syrup aside to cool.
Meanwhile bake the cake.  Preheat the oven to 350.  With a pastry
brush, coat the bottom and sides of an 8 by 12 inch baking pan with 1
tablespoon of the melted butter.
In a deep mixing bowl, stir the semolina and 3 cups of sugar
together until thoroughly combined.  Stirring constantly, pour in up
to 3/4 cup of water, a few tablespoons at a time, using only enough
to moisten all the semolina.  When the mixture becomes too resistant
to stir, work in the water with your hands.  Then add 8 tablespoons
(« cup) of the melted butter, a tablespoon at a time, and beat with a
large spoon until it is absorbed.
Pour the batter into the baking pan, and with a metal spatula or
the back of a spoon, spread it evenly into the corners of the pan.
then with a sharp knife and a ruler, score the surface into diamonds
by making parallel lines about 2 inches apart and « inch deep, then
crossing them diagonally to form diamond shapes.  Gently press an
almond half in the center of each diamond. Brush the cake with 3
tablespoons of melted butter and bake in the middle of the oven for 1
hour, or until the cake is firm to the touch and the top is
delicately browned.
Remove the cake from the oven and immediately sprinkle the syrup
over the top, a tablespoon or two at a time.  Use only as much of the
syrup as the cake will absorb readily; it should be soft but not
soggy. Let the cake cool to room temperature before serving it.
