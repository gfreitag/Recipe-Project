Preheat oven to 325 F. Wash the egg plants and cut in half lengthwise.
Scoop out the contents as much as possible, leaving 1/4-inch-thick
shells, put aside. Chop the egg plant centers.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and brown the chopped egg
plant, ground beef, onion, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper.
Stir and add the parsley, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and bread crumbs;
mix well. Cook until the egg plant is fork tender. Spoon the egg
plant mixture into the egg plant shells. Place in a baking dish and
pour tomato sauce over each egg plant. Top with shredded mozzarella
cheese and bake for approx 30 mins.
