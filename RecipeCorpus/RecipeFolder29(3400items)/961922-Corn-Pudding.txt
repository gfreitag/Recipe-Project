1 c  Milk*
-Pinch of salt
1 cn Creamed style corn
2 tb Flour
3    Well beaten eggs
For your Thanksgiving Dinner here is a corn dish recipe.  If you have
room in your oven, put this in the oven approximately one hour before
the turkey is done.  This is so good with a turkey or chicken dinner,
and so simple to make.  It's an old Penn. Dutch family recipe. *I use
1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/2 cup water or even one cup of light
cream in place of the milk. Mix all together. Pour into a well
buttered baking dish and sprinkle with paprika. Bake approximately
for 1 hour at 375 degrees or at meat temperature for probably a
longer period of time. It is done when a silver knife inserted in the
middle of the pudding comes out clean. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN
