Title: Fool Midammis (Broad Bean Salad)
Categories: Middle east, Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Lemon juice, fresh
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Parsley; finely chopped,
;prefer flat leaf parsley
8    Black olives; pitted, prefer
;Mediterranean type
1 c  Fool misri, dried; small
;fava or broad beans
1 tb Ads majroosh; (dried red
;lentils), or other dried
;lentils
1/4 c  Olive oil
Wash the beans and lentils in a sieve or colander set under cold
running water until the water runs clear.  Then drain thoroughly.
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan, bring 1 quart of water to a boil
over high heat.  Add the beans and lentils, reduce the heat to low
and partially cover the pan.  Simmer for 3 to 4 hours, or until the
beans are tender and show no resistance when pressed gently between
your fingers. Check from time to time to make sure that the beans are
moist. If they seem dry, add a few tablespoons of boiling water. When
they are done, there should be almost no liquid left in the pan.
Transfer the entire contents of the pan to a bowl and cool to room
temperature.
With a whisk or fork, beat the oil, lemon juice and salt together
in a deep bowl.  Add the beans and lentils and, mashing them gently
with a fork, stir until they absorb most of the dressing.
To serve, spread the bean mixture on a platter or individual plates,
sprinkle the top with parsley, and garnish with olives.
