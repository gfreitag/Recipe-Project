"Use a good-flavored cheese such as Maytag, Roquefort, Stilton,
Gorgonzola, or Danish bleu."

Break up the cheese into small pieces and reserve.  In a mixing bowl,
combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, salt, pepper,
Worcestershire sauce, and Tabasco sauce and whisk well.  Gently stir
in the cheese, celery, scallions, and chives.  Do not overmix, as the
cheese will turn an unappetizing blue-grey.  Keep refrigerated.
