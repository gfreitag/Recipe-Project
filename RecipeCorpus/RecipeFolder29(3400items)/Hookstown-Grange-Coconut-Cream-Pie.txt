1. Make the filling: Combine the sugar, cornstarch mixture, egg yolks
and salt in a saucepan. Add the milk, stir, and bring to a boil.
Immediately lower the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the
mixture thickens.

2. Off the heat, blend in vanilla, butter and coconut. Let the
custard cool for about 15 mins, then pour it into the pie shell.
While it cools, preheat the oven to 350 F.

3. Make the meringue: In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with a
whisk or an electric mixer until very frothy, gradually beat in the
sugar, and continue beating at high speed until the whites stand in
unwavering peaks. Spoon the meringue on the warm pie filling, making
decorative swirls with the back of spoon. Spread it to cover all the
filling, sealing the edges to anchor the meringue so that it does not
shrink. Sprinkle with coconut. Bake for 5 to 10 mins, until lightly
browned. Chill thoroughly before serving.
