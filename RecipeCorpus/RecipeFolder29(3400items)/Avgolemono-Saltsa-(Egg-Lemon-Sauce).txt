Makes 2 cups.  This is a basic sauce in Greek cooking which is used
in many ways in many recipes, either poured over vegetables, fish,
and meats or combined into the sauce in which the meats or vegetables
were cooked. Whenever possible, use the stock in which the dish was
cooked. If fresh stock is not available, canned broth or diluted
chicken stock base may be substituted.

To prepare, beat egg whites until stiff.  Add egg yolks and continue
beating.  Add lemon juice very slowly, beating constantly so that the
sauce does not curdle.  Thicken hot broth with cornstarch dissolved
in a little cold water.  Slowly add boiling stock to egg mixture,
beating constantly until smooth and creamy.  If a recipe calls for
adding the egg-lemon sauce to the sauce or stock in which a dish was
cooked, omit the cornstarch, and add according to directions in the
recipe.
