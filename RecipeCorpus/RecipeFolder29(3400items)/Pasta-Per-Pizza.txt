Stir the yeast into the water in a large bowl & let proof for 10
minutes. Stir in the olive oil.  Whisk in the salt & add flour a cup
at a time. Knead until soft & velvety, about 10 minutes.  Cover & let
rise until doubled.

Punch dough down & divide it in half.  Roll halves into balls & let
them rise under moist cloths for 20 to 30 minutes.

VARIATIONS:  For Neapolitan Pizza, omit the oil.

If you are at work all day, reduce the amount of yeast & let rise
slowly for 8 hours or so.  Ensure it is tightly covered.

Use 3/4 c wholewheat flour with 3 1/4 c white flour.
