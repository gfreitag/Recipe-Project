Noodles were of the utmost importance in the Ashkenazi kitchen. They
were served on their own as a substantial dairy meal or as an
accompanying dish with main courses. They were baked into sweet and
savory kugels or served with soups. The following recipes have been
selected for their flavor and ease of preparation.

Sift the flour onto a kneading board. Make a well in the center. Add
the eggs and start mixing in the flour. Sprinkle with water and knead
well into a stiff elastic dough. Divide the dough into two equal
parts. Roll into balls and cover with a moist tea towelto rest for
about 1/2 hour. Flour the board well and roll the dough very thin.
Dust the rolled dough lightly with flour and roll up the sheet of
dough into a long sausage-shape. Slice across into noodles of the
desired thickness. Traditionally the noodles were sliced into 3
widths: 1/2" (15mm), 3/10" (7mm) and thin vermicelli 1/16" - 1/8"
(1-2mm)(served in soups or baked into kugels). Unravel each strand of
dough an dleave to dry, hanging on a clean broomstick or draped on a
clean tea towel over the back of a chair. To cook, boil in plenty of
salted water for about 3 minutes. Drain well. The noodles can also be
thoroughly dried and stored in airtight containers.
