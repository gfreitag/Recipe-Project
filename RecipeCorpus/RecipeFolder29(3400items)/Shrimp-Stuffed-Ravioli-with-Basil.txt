MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
1/2 c  Puree, basil ***
2 c  Cream, heavy
2 tb Cheese, Parmesan, grated
** Egg wash is made of 1 egg, a dash of olive oil, salt and
pepper to taste.

*** In a blender, add fresh basil to 1 tablespoon of white wine.

Filling: ========

Melt the butter in a saute pan, then cook the onion, and garlic
in the butter for about 5 minutes over medium heat.  Add the tomatoes
and shrimp, heat to a gentle boil, then simmer for 15 minutes.

Add cayenne pepper, salt, and white pepper to taste, then cook
for 35 minutes.  Set aside in a refrigerator until cold.

Pasta: ======

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and egg.  Mix slowly, adding
cooled melted butter, water, and salt.  Mix only enough to
incorporate, then run through a pasta machine to form thin sheets.
(Mixing too much will result in a tougher pasta.)

Sauce: ======

Reduce basil puree by one-half.  Add cream, reduce to a smooth
consistency, and remove from heat.  Add Parmesan cheese, salt and
white pepper.  Strain and reserve.  (Sauce should be of a medium
consistency.)

Assembly: =========

Lay buttered sheet of parchment paper on your work surface.
Onto the parchment, place one sheet of pasta and brush it with egg
wash.

Place a large spoonful of filling about every 4 inches on the
pasta sheet.  Lay a second sheet of pasta over the top and form
tightly around the filling, then brush with egg wash.

Cut around piles of filling and parchment to form raviolis. Place
raviolis in saute pan, and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and
cook al dente.  (Your best bet to know when the ravioli is done
correctly is to take a piece of the dough that isn't used for the
sheets, insure that it is the same double thickness as the final
raviolis, and add it to the pan as you cook the ravioli.  You can use
this "spare" piece to judge the al dente qualities of the cooked
raviolis.)

Place cooked ravioli on a plate and cover with sauce.  Garnish
with fresh basil leaves and chopped tomato.
