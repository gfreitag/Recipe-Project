For the pastry cornets: =======================

Roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface to 3" x
20" rectangle, 1/4" thick.  Cut the rectangle into 4 long strips,
each 3/4" wide.

Wrap each strip around a long metal cone (which can be made from
heavy-duty aluminum foil), beginning at the tip and rolling the strip
around and around, overlapping slightly.  Place these on an ungreased
baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour or more.

Preheat oven to 375 F.

Bake pastry cornets until golden, about 15 minutes.

Cool briefly, then very carefully the metal or foil cones.

For the lemon dressing: =======================

Combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice, and salt and pepper.
Whisk in the oil a drop at a time.  When the dressing begins to
thicken, add the oil 1 teaspoon at a time, then continue adding oil
in a thin stream.

Adjust seasonings to taste.

Cook the asparagus, tied in bundles, in boiling salted water
until it's just crisp-tender; drain.

Construction: =============

Pour a small amount of dressing on each serving plate.

Place a cornet on top of the dressing and tuck the asparagus
into the ends of the cornet, fanning the tips outward.
