6 oz Tomato paste
6 c  Water

HEAT THE BUTTER IN A LARGE HEAVY SKILLET over medium-high heat. Add
the meat to the skillet. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook,
stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned. Stir in all
the remaining ingredients up through the water. Taste and adjust
seasonings. If the flavor is too sweet, add a small amount of
vinegar; if not spicy enough, add a small amount of ground chile.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer,
uncovered, for 2 to 4 hours. Add the kidney beans to the mixture 1/2
hour before serving. Place a small amount of the cooked vermicelli in
individual bowls. Spoon on a generous amount of chili. Top with
grated cheese and raw onion or pass in individual bowls.
