** Simply toast almonds at 350 F for 7 to 10 minutes.

For Almond Meringue: ====================

Preheat the oven to 325 F. Cut out three 10-inch parchment paper
circles and one 10-inch cardboard circle.  Set the parchment circles
on baking sheets.

Beat egg whites to soft peaks and gradually add 2 1/2
tablespoons of sugar and continue beating until stiff.  Combine 2 1/2
cups of powdered sugar and ground almonds; fold into egg whites.

Spoon mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a no.  6 round tip.
(A number six tip leaves a round, tube-like stream a little less than
a half inch in diameter.) Pipe meringue onto parchment circles,
starting in the center and spiraling outward just to the edge.  Dust
lightly with powdered sugar.  Bake the circles until crisp and very
lightly golden (25 to 30 minutes.)  Cool on racks.

For Buttercream: ================

Place a medium bowl in a larger bowl of ice water.  Set Aside.

Bring milk to the boiling point in a heavy saucepan over medium
heat.

Meanwhile, beat egg yolks in a large mixer bowl until smooth.
Gradually add 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sugar and continue berating
until the mixture is pale yellow and forms a ribbon when beaters are
lifted (about 7 minutes.)

Gradually add boiling milk to yolk mixture, beating constantly to
avoid the yolk curdling.  Return the mixture to the saucepan, and
cook over low heat - stirring with a wooden spoon, for 30 seconds.
Immediately pour custard into the bowl set over ice water.

Cool, stirring occasionally.

Beat the butter and praline paste in a large bowl until smooth
and creamy.  Gradually beat in cooled custard.

To Assemble: ============

Using cardboard as a guide, trim meringues to even circles.
Carefully peel off the parchment paper.  Choose 1 meringue with a
smooth bottom and set aside.

Spread 1/3 of the cream onto 1 meringue layer.  Top with a second
meringue, centering it over the bottom layer.  Smooth on another
layer of buttercream.  Top with remaining meringue, smooth side up,
pressing gently. Frost sides and top of cake with remaining
buttercream.  Gently press sliced almonds onto sides and top with a
spatula.

Dust about 2 inches of rim and 2-inch circle in center with
powdered sugar.  Transfer to serving platter.  Let stand at room
temperature for 30 minutes before serving in wedges.
