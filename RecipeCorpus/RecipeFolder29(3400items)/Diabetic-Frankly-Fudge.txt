Title: Diabetic Frankly Fudge
Categories: Candies, Diabetic
Yield: 100 servings
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Sweetener equiv. to sugar**
1 ts Artificial brandy extract
1 c  2% milk
3/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
5 tb Unflavored gelatin (5 pkg)
Preparation 10 min, standing time 4 hours.

In small saucepan, combine milk and cocoa.  Whisk until there are no
lumps of cocoa.  Cook over medium heat, stirring for about 5 min or
until thickened.  (This cooks out the raw cocoa taste.)

In another small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water; let stand for
5 min to soften.

Heat over low heat, stirring, until gelatin dissolves.  Stir into
cocoa mixture.

Stir in sweetener (artificial sweetener like SugarTwin equivalent to
1/2 cup sugar) and brandy extract.  Remove from heat.

Pour into 8 inch square baking dish.  Let stand at room temperature 4
hours or until firm.

To remove from pan, cut around edges with a sharp knife.  Place dish
in shallow pan of hot water for about 30 seconds just to slightly
soften bottom.  Loosen one corner, then quickly flip gel out onto
clean cutting surface.

With sharp knife, cut evenly in 10 one way and 10 the other way.
Place in container, cover and refrigerate.  Will keep up to 1 week in
refrigerator. Makes 100 squares.
