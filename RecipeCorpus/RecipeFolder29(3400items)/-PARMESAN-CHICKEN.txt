"The savory coating on this chicken has the satisfying flavor of
Parmesan cheese.  It's easy enough to be a family weekday meal yet
impressive enough to serve to guests. When I make this chicken for
dinner, we never have leftovers." - Schelby Thompson

In a pie plate or shallow bowl, combine butter, mustard,
Worcestershire sauce and salt.  In a plastic bag, combine crumbs and
Parmesan cheese.  Dip chicken in butter mixture, then shake in crumb
mixture.  Place in an ungreased 13x9x2" baking pan.  Drizzle with any
remaining butter mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes or
until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
