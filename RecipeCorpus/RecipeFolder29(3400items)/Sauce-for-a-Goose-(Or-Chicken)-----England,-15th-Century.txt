"Sauce for a Gos" from "Two Fifteenth-century Cookery Books"

"Stuff the goose with parsley, peeled and seeded grapes, garlic;
season the stuffing with salt and pepper. When the goose is done,
take out the stuffing, put it in a bowl, and mix it with riced hard-
boiled egg yolk (1 egg yolk to 1 cup of stuffing.) Mix well and add a
little verjuice or cider vinegar. Reheat in a pan and serve with the
goose, and its gravy."
