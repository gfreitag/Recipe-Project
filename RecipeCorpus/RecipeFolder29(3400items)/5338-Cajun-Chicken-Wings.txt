3/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Brandy
2 tb Fresh lemon or lime juice
12    Chicken wings, tips removed

-small bits
3/4 ts Caraway seeds
1/2    To 3/4 tsp. cayenne pepper

Defat the chicken wings by cooking them in boiling water for 10
minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Using a large mortar and pestle, grind together the bay leaf bits,
caraway seeds, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, garlic, mustard,
paprika, thyme and salt for about 10 minutes.  Add the brandy and
lemon or lime juice to the pulverized herbs and stir into a thick
paste. With a pastry brush, cover both sides of each wing with the
herb paste. When no more remains in the mortar, squeeze the last few
drops from the brush. Arrange the chicken wings on a baking sheet.
Bake until the skin turns deep brown and is quite crisp approximately
30 minutes. Takes about an hour to prepare. Submitted By BARRY
