1. Gently cook the celery, onion and carrots in the chicken broth
until just tender. Add the cornstarch mixture, stir, and cook a few
mins over moderate heat until thickened. Add peas, chicken and basil.
Put mixture in a wide casserole that just fits it.

2. Make the biscuits by mixing the flour, salt and baking powder. Cut
in the shortening with a pastry cutter, or use your fingers to rub
the flour and fat together until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Pour in the milk and stir with fork just until dough holds together.
Knead 12 times, about 30 secs. Roll out on a lightly floured surface
to a circle 1/2-inch thick. Cut the biscuits with a biscuit cutter
and place on top of the pie. Bake in the center of the oven about 30
mins, or until the broth is bubbling and the biscuits are a delicate
brown.
