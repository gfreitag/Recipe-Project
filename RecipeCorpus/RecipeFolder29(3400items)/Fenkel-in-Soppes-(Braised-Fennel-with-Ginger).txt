Categories: Vegetables, Medieval

(optional)

The original version of this recipe comes from the "Forme of Cury", a
collection of 196 "reciepts" copied by Richard II's scribes at his
cooks' directions.

DIRECTIONS:

Put the fennel in a wide, lidded pan with the onions.  Sprinkle over
the spices and salt, then the oil and finally pour over the liquids.
Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes or till the
fennel is cooked without being mushy.  Stir once or twice during the
cooking to make sure the spices get well distributed.  Serve it alone
with a roast meat or griddled fish or place one slice of bread on
each warmed plate, cover it with the fennel and pour over the juices.
