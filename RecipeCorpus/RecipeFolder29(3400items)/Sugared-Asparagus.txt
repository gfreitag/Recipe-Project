"This tasty recipe is a simple way to dress up one of our favorites -
asparagus!" - Billie Moss

In a skillet over medium-high, heat butter and brown sugar is
dissolved. Add asparagus; saute for 2 minutes.  Stir in chicken
broth; bring to a boil.

Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until asparagus is
crisp-tender. Remove asparagus to a serving dish and keep warm. Cook
sauce, uncovered, until reduced by half.  Pour over asparagus and
serve immediately.
