cook zucchini and onions in butter until tender, about 8 minutes.

cooked vegetable mixture.
Separate dough into 8 triangles.  Place in ungreased 10" pie pan,
12 x 8" baking dish or 11" quiche pan; press over bottom and up sides
to form crust. (NOTE: if using 12 x 8 pan, 2 long rectangles; press
over bottom and 1" up sides to form crust.) Firmly press perforations

near center comes out clean.  Cover edge of crust with strips of foil
during last 10 minutes of baking if necessary to prevent excessive
browning. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Millicent Caplan, FL.
