This is for the convenience of having the benefit of the fruit at any
season.  The tomatoes are skinned and salted, and set into a vessel
in a water bath, and stewed for half an hour; the excess of juice may
be drained off, which will do for catsup, then spread the pulp on
earthen dishes or plates, and dry them gradually in a cool stove or
brick oven; when quite dry hang them in bags in a dry room, and soak
when wanted to cook for sauce - but they will require seasoning with
pepper and butter. Origin: The Canadian Settler's Guide, written in
