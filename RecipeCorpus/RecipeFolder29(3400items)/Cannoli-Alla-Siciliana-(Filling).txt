Title: Cannoli Alla Siciliana (Filling)
Categories: Desserts, Italian, Pastry
Yield: 18 cannoli
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING:-------------------------------
3 tb Cocoa PLUS
2 tb Chocolate bits (jimmies)
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
2 c  Ricotta
1 c  Whipped heavy cream
3 tb Sugar (or more)
2 tb Candied fruits -OR-
FILLING:  Put the ricotta in a bowl and fold in the whipped cream,
adding the sugar as you fold.  Chop the candied fruits to tiny
slivers no bigger than grains of rice and fold in all but about a
teaspoonful. Add the vanilla.  Using a spatual or a broad knife, fill
the cannoli first from one end and then from the other. Press the
filling in gently to make sure the center is full. Scrape each end to
smooth out the cream and decorate the ends by dipping them in the
remaining candied fruit slivers. If you want to make the filling
chocolate, substitute cocoa for the candied fruits in the
cream-ricotta mixture, and decorate with grated chocolate or the
chocolate jimmies.  The cannoli should not be filled too long before
serving, as that softenes the pastry. The filling, however, can be
chilled, and both parts of this elegant dessert can be made ahead of
time and assembled shortly before the meal.  From Romagnoli's Table.
