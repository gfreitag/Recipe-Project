Title: Chinese Leavened Dough I
Categories: Chinese, Breads
Yield: 24 buns
6 c  Flour, sifted
2 tb Shortening
1/4 c  Sugar
1 3/4 c  Warm water
1 tb Yeast
Mix first three ingredients. Let stand for ten minutes or until
mixture foams. If it doesn't foam, toss it and start again. Add flour
and shortening. Mix and fashion into a ball. Remove from bowl and
knead on a board until smooth and elastic (you may have to add water
or flour to fix the consistency). Put dough in a clean bowl, cover
with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until at least
doubled in bulk (2 to 4 hours). Submitted By JIM WELLER   On
