Title: Amazu Shuga (Pickled Pink Ginger)
Categories: Japanese, Condiments

1/4 ts Salt
*Large pieces, pref. with
-pinkish skin, scraped
1/3 lb Fresh, Young, Ginger root*
1/3 c  Rice Vinegar
1/4 c  Sugar
Whilst poring over my three volume loose leaf cookbook (inhabited
mainly by stuff snatched from here) I ran across the following that I
though you might be interested in.  I think that the caveat about
fresh, young ginger root is necessary to this recipe.  I don't think
the older, woody stuff would work at all.  Guess this originally
appeared here from the heading...

Using a sharp knife or a Beriner cutter,shave ginger root into paper-
thin slices.  In a small, airtight container, combine vinnegar, sugar
and salt. Blanch ginger for 30 seconds in boiling water.  Drain
ginger; cool. If desired, reserve liquid for cooking purposes.  Add
cooled ginger to vinegar mixture; mix well.  Store marinating ginger
in the refrigerator. Pickled ginger can be eaten after 24 hours of
marinating. It will keep several weeks.  Good with either Sushi or
noodles. Add marinade to salads or sauces.

Makes 1 serving.
