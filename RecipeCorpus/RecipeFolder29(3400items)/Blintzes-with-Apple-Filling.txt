Qty

In a bowl, mix together the chopped apples, egg white, chopped
walnuts, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon powder.

In the center of a crepe, place about 1 tablespoon of the apple
filling. Fold the bottom of the crepe up over the filling.  Fold the
opposite sides of the crepe over to meet in the middle of the crepe.
Now fold the crepe over again to completely enclosed the filling.
Arrange the filled crepes, fold-side down, on a platter to wait until
all the blintzes are made. When the blintzes are filled they can be
frozen or refrigerated until ready to use.

In a frying pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter or margarine.  Fry the
blintzes on both sides until golden brown.  Add more butter or
margarine to the frying as needed.  Serve hot.  Makes 16 to 18
blintzes.
