For dressing, mash anchovies using a pestle and mortar.  Add garlic
and gradually whisk in remaining ingredients.  Set aside.  Remove
crusts from the bread and cut into 2cm cubes.  Spread on an oven

little more oil and turning during cooking if necessary, for 10-15
minutes, or until lightly golden.  Set aside.  Wash and dry lettuce
thoroughly, removing any tough outer leaves, and place in a large
salad bowl.

Pour enough dressing over to coat leaves thoroughly and toss well.
Break eggs into salad bowl and toss well.  Add grated parmesan and
half the croutons.  Toss again.  Top with remaining croutons,
parmesan shavings and anchovies.  Serve immediately.
