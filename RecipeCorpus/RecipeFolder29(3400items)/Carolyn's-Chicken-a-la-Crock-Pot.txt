Title: Carolyn's Chicken a la Crock Pot
Categories: Poultry, Crockpot
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Honey
1/2 c  Orange Juice
1    Roaster Chicken
1    Lemon
Rinse Chicken well inside and out.  Roll the lemon on a flat top to
soften, and pierce well with a 2 tined fork. Place the lemon in the
cavity of the chicken and place the chicken in the crock pot.

Mix the honey and the orange juice together well and pour over the
chicken. I sometime add a sprinkle of garlic pepper at this point.
Not always.

Cook on low until done.  When you take the chicken out of the pot,
remove the lemon very carefully, it will be hot and squeeze the juice
over the chicken.  Yummy!

If you try this recipe I would appreciate feed back on it. Thank you.
