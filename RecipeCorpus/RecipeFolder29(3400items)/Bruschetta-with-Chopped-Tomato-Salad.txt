Crusty toasted bread infused with garlic and sometimes topped with
any of a variety of seasonings and seasonal ingredients, bruschetta
is a classic Italian treat.  I've made two changes in the traditional
Tuscan version on which this recipe is based: I've omitted the
typically generous addition of fatty oil and I've use as toppings a
zesty salad mixture that can be spooned onto the bruschetta as
desired.
