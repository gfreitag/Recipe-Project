Title: CHEWY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES like Mrs. Fields makes
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 60 servings  2 cups (450 g) butter 2 cups (380 g) sugar (granulated white) 2 cups
(400 g) brown sugar (dark brown) 4 eggs (large -- use 5 if medium) 2
tsp (10 ml) vanilla extract 4 cups (400 g) flour (sift before
measuring) 5 cups (250 g) rolled oats (oatmeal), powdered finely. 1
tsp (5 ml) salt 2 tsp (10 ml) baking soda 2 tsp (10 ml) baking powder
24 oz (700 g) chocolate chips Toll House

8 oz (225 g) chocolate bar, finely grated. 3 cups (400 g) chopped
nuts (I prefer walnuts, but you can use your
favorite type.)

1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190C).

2.  Cream together the butter and the sugars.

3.  Sift together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder,
and the shredded chocolate bar.

4.  Add eggs and vanilla to creamed sugar and butter, then mix all
ingredients together.

5.  Mix chocolate chips and nuts into mixture.

6.  Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheet in small drops.

7.  Bake 6 minutes or until done.

A blender works very well to powder the oats and the chocolate bar.
The blender chops the oatmeal finer than a food processor. The
powdered chocolate bar should melt at the touch of your fingers.
