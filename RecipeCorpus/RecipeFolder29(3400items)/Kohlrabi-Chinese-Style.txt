In a wok or large, heavy, non-stick skillet, heat the peanut oil until
moderately hot. Add the kohlrabi, mushrooms, pepper, shallots,
garlic, and ginger, and stir-fry for a min or two. Then add the rice
wine, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Cover and cook 5 to 6 mins, or until
tender, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the water and cornstarch and mix
until smooth. Add to the wok and stir another minute or two, until
the juices thicken. Add the sugar and salt and garnish with the
toasted nuts. Serve as a vegetable side dish with rice and meat,
chicken, or fish.
