Title: Fried buns with pork
Categories: Chinese, Breads, Meats
Yield: 24 servings
1 1/2 ts Ginger root, chopped
3 tb Water
1    Recipe basic yeast dough
1/2 c  Toasted sesame seeds
1/8 c  Oil
1 c  Boiling water
11 oz Pork loin , ground coarse
2 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Salt
1 ts MSG (may be omitted)
1 tb Sesame oil
2 tb Scallion greens, chopped
Mix first 8 ingredients. Divide into 24 portions.

Knead dough 5 min; roll out into a thin baguette; cut into 24 pieces.
Flatten each piece into a 2" round; then go around with your fingers
and squeeze the edges thin - the result should be a medium-thin
center and a thin outside.

Put 1 portion (1+ oz) filling in the center of each round. Fashion
into a dumpling shape. Dip the top half into sesame seeds, pressing
the seeds to make them stick.

Heat a large frying pan on medium, add the oil, reduce heat to low.
Put in buns (sesame-side up) side by side in a single layer. Fry 2
minutes. Add boiling water, cover, and cook 10 min or until all
liquid has just boiled away. Serve.
