Categories: Meats, Poultry, Salsa/sauce, Whitetrash
Yield: 1 servings
Salt
Pepper
Oil
Round steak, bout the size
-of a piece of bread but
-twice as thick
Flour
Pound on the steak until it's thin and tender.  Sprinkle with salt and
pepper.  Dredge in flour until you can get a nice thick coating of
flour on it...  if not thick enough, let it sit a couple of minutes
for the juices in the meat to seep through and dredge through the
flour again. Fry it in a hot skillet with just enough oil to prevent
it from sticking. Cook until well done and serve with white gravy.

Save the drippings from
frying the steak.  Determine how much drippings you have and judge
just how much milk and flour will the needed to thicken the
drippings. (1/4 cup milk to 2 tbsp flour) Sprinkle the flour into the
drippings and stir while cooking over low heat.  When the flour has
been incoporated into the drippings, slowly start adding the milk
until you reach the consistency you desire.. Don't forget... good
flour gravy takes a practiced hand and oftimes many tries to get
perfect!
