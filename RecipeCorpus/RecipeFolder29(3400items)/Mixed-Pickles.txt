The Goodman had recipes for pickling walnuts and various vegetables
and fruits grown on his farm separately, but he soaked the whole lot
in honey--to the ruin of his household's teeth, I should think!  This
recipe is much more like the modern ones.

Prepare the root vegetables and slice them thinly.  Core and shred the
cabbage.  Put these vegetables into a large pan of water and bring
slowly to the boil.  Peel, core and cut up the pears and add them to
the pan. Cook until they start to soften.  Drain the contents of the
pan and spread in a 5-cm/2-inch layer in a shallow non-metallic dish.
Sprinkle with the salt, ginger, saffron and 4 tablespoons of the
vinegar. Leave, covered, for 12 hours.  Rinse well, then add the
currants. Pack into sterilised storage jars, with at least
2.5-cm/1-inch headspace.

Put the wine and honey in a pan.  Bring to simmering point and skim.
Add the rest of the vinegar and all the remaining spices and sugar.
Reduce the heat and stir without boiling until the sugar dissolves.
Bring back to the boil.  Pour over the vegetables, covering them with
1 cm/ 1/2 inch liquid. Cover with vinegar-proof seals and store.
