Title: Amish Friendship No Yeast Starter
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
1 c  Sugar
Mix together and let sit on counter. Stir every day until it has sat
for at least 3 to 4 days. You will know it is ready when it keeps
popping the plastic lid off itself, or tends to become really sticky
when you stir it.

You can then proceed with any of the Friendship cake instructions
using your own starter.  Just start with the day one instructions and
continue to add the sugar, flour, etc.
