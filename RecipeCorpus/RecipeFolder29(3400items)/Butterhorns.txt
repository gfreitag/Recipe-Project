egg yolks, sour cream and vanilla. Wrap the dough in plastic and
refrigerate at least 1 hour.

2. Make the filling. Beat the egg whites with the granulated sugar
until soft peaks form. Fold in the nuts and vanilla.

3. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll each portion into a
thin 8-inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 pie-shaped parts.

4. Place a Tbs of filling on each wedge and spread slightly. Starting
at the large end, roll up and place on lightly greased baking sheets;
with your fingers shape each portion into a crescent. Bake about 10
mins, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack and dust with
confectioners' sugar while still warm.
