Title: Breakfast Tacos
Categories: Main dish, Breakfast
Yield: 1 serving
2    Eggs, beaten
2 tb Cheese Whiz, or a slice of
-Cheddar or other similiar
-cheese, cut into chunks
Salt and pepper to taste
3    Flour tortillas, heated
2    Bacon strips, cut into 1/2
-inch dice
1    Generous handful frozen hash
-browns (or one very small
-cooked potato, grated)
1 ts Onion, finely chopped
Fry bacon in a small pan until all of the fat is rendered, and the
bacon is crisp.  Remove from the pan, and set aside.  Drain off all
but about 1 Tbsp. of the bacon fat.

Toss the potato and onion into the pan, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the potatoes are nicely browned.

Pour the eggs over the potatoes, and cook, stirring until nearly set.
Toss in the cheese and reserved bacon, and stir.

Scoop into warm tortillas, roll, and chow down.

This was my dinner last night (Wes had something else), and I enjoyed
it thoroughly.  Note:  I added a generous proportion of hot salsa,
plus a shot of jalapeno Tabasco Sauce to mine.  Others might want to
be more cautious ;-)

Author unknown, as this was before I started keeping track, but it
sure looks like Kathy Pitts, doesn't it?   U/L to Cooking again by
