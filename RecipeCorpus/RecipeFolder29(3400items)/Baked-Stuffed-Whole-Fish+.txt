Title: Baked Stuffed Whole Fish+
Categories: Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 1 fish
1    Tomato, thinly sliced
Oil or butter for
-lubrication
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
3 sl Bacon
1/2 c  Dry white wine
5 lb Fish, (walleye or salmon
-for example) could be
-smaller or larger
2 md Onions, sliced very thin
1    Green pepper, cut in thin
-rings
Few sprigs parsley
Wash the fish. Set the oven at 450 degrees F. and preheat a baking
dish lined with a double thickness of heavy foil. This will enable
you to lift the fish out and place it on a platter, after it is done.

While the oven is heating, stuff the fish with the vegetables, and
season the stuffing with a bit of salt and pepper (to taste.) Add
dots of butter, using 2 tablespoons. Secure the stuffing with
toothpicks or wooden skewers. When the oven is hot, butter or oil the
foil in the baking pan. put the fish in the pan and rub it well with
butter. Strip the top with 3 slices of bacon and bake, allowing 10 to
12 minutes per pound. Baste frequently with butter and white wine.
Test for doneness by sticking a small metal skewer in the fish at its
thickest part (halfway through.) Hold it there for 2 seconds,
withdraw it quickly and put the tip of the skewer on your lower lip.
If it is cool it is not done. If it is just warm the fish is still
not done. A little warmer and it may be a bit pink in the middle
which is perfect for some. I prefer the skewer to be rather hot which
indicates a fully cooked fish. If the skewer is really hot the fish
may be overdone.

Remove the fish, foil and all, to a platter and serve with parsley
butter, lemon butter or holandaise sauce.

Basically, this recipe came from James Beard. The wine is my own
innovation which makes the drippings so delicious that my family has
been seen gathering around the foil liner scraping up each little bit
with a spoon.
