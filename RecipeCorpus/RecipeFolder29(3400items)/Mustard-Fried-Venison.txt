I have 2 entire cookbooks devoted to the cooking of wild game (which
yes, often requires different seasoning than beef or chicken requires
to achieve a desirebale flavor). What sort of recipes did you have in
mind? I thumb through my books and see what's there. Here's one that
sounded interesting: serves 4-6, prep time 30 minutes Season steaks
and pepper.  Combine
with your own blend of salt [PAUSE]
mustard and horseradish. Spread mixture on each side of steaks so
that the steaks are fully covered on both sides. Fry in hot olive
oil, being careful to avoid being splattered. Poke with fork and as
soon as juices run clear, steaks are done and ready to be served with
whatever garnishment you prefer. A baked potatoe and a green, dinner
salad rounds out a delicious meal.

caribou, mountain goat, and antelope; microwave cooking, waterfowl,
bear, upland game birds, turkey, small game such as rabbit, squirrel,
