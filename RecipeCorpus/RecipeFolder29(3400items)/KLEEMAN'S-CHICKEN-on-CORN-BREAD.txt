MMMMM----------------------***CORN BREAD***---------------------------
1 ts Salt
6 tb Shortening
1 c  Buttermilk
2    Eggs
1 c  Cornmeal
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
MMMMM------------------------***SAUCE***-----------------------------
3 pt Chicken broth
1/2 c  Cream or milk
Salt and pepper to taste
6 tb Minced onion
1 c  Butter
8 tb All-purpose flour
Place the chicken breasts in water to cover. Add salt, pepper, grated
ginger, celery, carrot, parsley and onion. Cook until just done. Keep
warm. Use the strained broth for your sauce. Preheat oven to 400.
Sift dry ingredients for corn bread into a mixing bowl. Cut in
shortening until well blended. In a seperate bowl, beat buttermilk
and eggs together. Mix with dry ingredients until just blended. Pour
into a well-greased oblong baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes or until
done. Corn bread should be just baked and very hot when served. It's
best that way. While corn bread bakes, make sauce. Brown minced onion
in butter until golden. Add flour. Add chicken broth, cream or milk,
salt and pepper. Cook to desired thickness. Keep warm. Slice chicken,
place on split corn bread and pour sauce over top. Serve extra sauce
on the side.
