Title: WOVEN RYE-AND-PUMPERNICKEL BREAD - Country Living
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 loaf
1 1/2 c  Very warm water (120' to
-130'F)
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) butter, melted
1/4 c  Dark molasses
1    Large egg white (opt.)
2 1/2    To 3 C unsifted bread flour
2 1/2 c  Rye flour
2 pk Rapid-rising dry yeast
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
1. In each of 2 medium-size bowls, combine 1 1/4 C bread flour, 1 1/4
C rye flour, 1 pk yeast, and 1/4 t salt. Stir cocoa powder into one
of the bowls to color the pumpernickel dough.

2. With wooden spoon, beat 1/4 C water, 2 T butter, and 2 T molasses
into flour mixture in one bowl until soft dough forms. Tom dough out
onto floured surface. Knead dough, adding some of remaining flour (no
more than 1/4 C) as necessary to prevent stickiness, until smooth and
elastic-about 5 minutes.

3. Wash, dry, and oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl, turning
to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth.

4. Repeat mixing with remaining water, butter, molasses, and flour
mixture. Let doughs rise in warm place, away from drafts, until
double in size-about 30 minutes.

5. Lightly grease large baking sheet. With floured rolling pin, roll
each ball of dough into a 12- by 8-inch rectangle. Cut each rectangle
lengthwise into eight 1-inch strips.

6. On greased baking sheet, place rye strips, side by side, about 1/2
inch apart. Weave pumpernickel strips through rye strips. Tuck under
ends, of strips that finish on top of edge strips. Cover with clean
cloth and let rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in
size-about 40 minutes.

7. Heat oven to 375'F. If desired, lightly beat egg white and brush
over top of bread. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until bread is well
browned and sounds hollow when tapped on top. Cool bread on wire rack
for 20 minutes before cutting.
