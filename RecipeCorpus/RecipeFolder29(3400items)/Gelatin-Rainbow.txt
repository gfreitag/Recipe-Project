8 oz Cool whip

Stir 1 1/4 cups boiling water into each flavor of gelatin in separate
bowls until completely dissolved (2 minutes).  Pour each flavor into
separate 8 or 9" square pans.  Refrigerate 3 hours or until firm.
Cut each pan into 1" cubes.  Arrange rows of different color gelatin
cubes to form a rainbow on a large flat tray or cookie sheet.  Double
stack cubes, if desired. Place 1/2 of the cool whip at each end of
the rainbow to form clouds for dipping.  Serve immediately or
refrigerate until ready to serve. Source: Jello ad
