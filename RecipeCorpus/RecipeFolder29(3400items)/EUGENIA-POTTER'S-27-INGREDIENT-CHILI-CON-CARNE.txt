This recipe is from a mystery book by Nancy Pickard and Virginia
Rich. The book is "The 27* Ingredient Chili Con Carne Murders".

Wash and drain pinto beans and soak in water overnight. Bring to
boil, lower heat, and simmer 2 to 3 hours or until tender. Drain.
Meanwhile, melt butter in large skillet and add onions, chilies, and
garlic. Saute until onion is soft. Add chopped sirloin and cook over
moderate heat until meat is brown. In a separate pan brown sausage
and pour off fat. Add sausage to meat mixture. Sprinkle with flour
and stir to blend, then transfer to Dutch oven or 8 qt. kettle. Add
pinto and canned beans and all remaining ingredints except sour
cream; bring just to boil. Lower heat and simmer about 30 minutes.
Skim off fat with a cold spoon as it rises to the top. Serve with
sour cream. This freezes wonderfully.
