Title: Sweet Banana Tacos with Toasted Almonds
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 tb Dark brown sugar
6    Corn or flour tortillas
1/2 c  Sliced almonds
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
1 tb Confectioners' sugar
2 lb Red bananas, saba bananas,
-slightly green regular
-bananas or sweet yellow
-plantains
6 tb Butter
1.  Peel the bananas or plantains; cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. In
a large frying pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high
heat until foaming.  Add the banana pieces and brown. Turn and brown
on the other side, about 1 minute altogether.  Remove from the heat;
set aside.

2.  Place 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1/2 tablespoon of the brown
sugar in a frying pan large enough to hold a tortilla.  Set over
medium-high heat until the butter foams and the sugar melts.  Stir,
then place a tortilla in the pan and fry for 30 seconds.  Turn and
fry on the other side, until warmed through and sugar coated but
still pliable, 30 seconds more. Remove and continue with the
remaining tortillas, adding a little more butter and sugar to the pan
as needed.

3.  Stir the almonds in an ungreased frying pan until toasted, 2 to 3
minutes.

4.  Place the sour cream and confectioners' sugar in a small bowl and
stir together until smooth.  (This will keep covered and refrigerated
for up to 1 week.)

5.  To assemble, spread about 1/3 cup of the bananas in the middle of
a sugar-coated tortilla.  Top with sweetened sour cream and toasted
almonds. Fold and serve.
