3/4 c  Chocolate chips
6    Corn OR
4    Flour tortillas

1.  Stack the tortillas in one pile and cut into triangles, 6 each for
corn, or 8 each for flour.

2.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the sugar
in a large frying pan.  Set over medium heat until the butter foams
and the sugar melts.  Add as many tortilla triangles as will fit
without overlapping and fry until they puff up, about 1 minute.  Turn
and fry on the other side until golden, about 1 minute more.  Remove
to a plate without overlapping.  Add more butter and sugar to the pan
and continue more rounds until all of the triangles are crisped.

3.  To assemble, arrange scoops of ice cream or sherbet in the center
of a large platter.  Strew fruit pieces around the ice cream and tuck
tortilla triangles in here and there.  Spoon Mango-Tequila sauce over
all. Dot with Sugared Nuts and chocolate chips.  Serve right away.
