Title: Shellfish Molee
Categories: Main dish, Seafood, Indian, Fish
Yield: 6 servings
6 sl Ginger (thin)
4    Cloves garlic
1/2 ts Turmeric
10 fl Thick coconut milk
1 ts Salt
1 lb Crabsticks, prawns -=OR=-
Other shellfish
3    Chillies, fresh or dried
2 oz Fat
1 lg Onion
Chop the onion and garlic and fry in the fat (ghee or vegetable oil)
until golden brown. Cut chillies lengthways, then in half. Add
turmeric, ginger, coconut milk and the chillies. Simmer 10 minutes
then add the salt. Then mix in as much shellfish as will be covered
by the amount of curried sauce and cook gently for 10 minutes more.
The pan MUST NOT be covered during cooking - the coconut milk will
curdle if you do.

You can use any shellfish (crustacean) you like, crabsticks, lobster,
crayfish, shrimps, prawns etc. You can also make a fish molee by
substituting a white fish and poaching just long enough for the fish
to be done.
