Categories: Basics, Breads, Masterchefs
Yield: 2 loaves
1/2 oz Salt
5 lg Eggs
8 oz Butter, unsalted
1 lb Flour, bread
1 1/2 oz Sugar
1/2 oz Yeast, fresh, active
In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, yeast and salt.  Blend well.  Add
eggs and continue mixing until dough is smooth.

Add butter in 4 stages, working each piece into the dough before
adding more.

Continue mixing until dough is very elastic and clings to the
spoon. Cover with plastic and chill for six hours.

Unwrap the dough and cut it in half.  Shape each half into a ball
and then work into a loaf with the palm of the hand.  Place each loaf
into a clean loaf pan and let stand in a warm spot.

When the dough has become slightly puffy, deflate with hands.
Allow the dough to rise again, to the top of the pan.

Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for about 45 minutes, until the
dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and is golden brown.

Turn loaves out of the pans and let them cool on a wire rack.
(Only one loaf is used in this recipe.)
