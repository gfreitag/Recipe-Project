Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Prepare 2 pieces of parchment paper
for papillotes by cutting a rectangle 12 x 16 inches.  Fold in half
to form an 8 x 12 inch rectangle, then cut into a half-heart shape as
you would a Valentine. Place a chicken breast in the center of one
half of each opened paper heart. Spread mustard evenly over chicken
breasts. Distribute leeks, carrots and thyme over the chicken. Season
with salt and pepper. Seal the package and place them on a baking
sheet. Bake for ten to twelve minutes, or until the packages are
puffed. (You may want to open one package to check that the chicken
is no longer pink inside.) Transfer the packages to individual
plates; let each diner open their own package. 189 calories per
