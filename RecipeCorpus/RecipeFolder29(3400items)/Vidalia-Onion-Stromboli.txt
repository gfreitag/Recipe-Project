Preheat oven to 375 F.

On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough to form a 6- to 8-inch
circle about 1/8 inch thick. Sprinkle half of the mozzarella over the
dough, then top with the sliced pepperoni, diced onion and remaining
mozzarella. Roll up the dough to form a log-like loaf. Pinch the
seams and ends to seal and place on a greased baking sheet.

Bake for 20 to 25 mins, or until golden. Slice and serve hot.
