heat to moderate, cover and cook 1 to 1 1/2 hrs, stirring from time
to time.

3. Add the beans and simmer 15 mins to flavors.

4. 30 mins before serving, line a very large bowl or tureen with bread
slices. Ladle on some of the vegetable mixture. Keep making layers of
bread and vegetables, ending with vegetables. Let stand 15 mins, so
the bread slices can absorb the liquid.
