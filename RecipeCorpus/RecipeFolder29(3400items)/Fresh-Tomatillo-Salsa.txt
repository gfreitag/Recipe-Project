Title: Fresh Tomatillo Salsa
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetables, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------ALL QUANTITIES APPROXIMATE----------------------
Green and the piquins red.
4    Cloves Garlic
1 sm Onion, really small, or half
Medium onion.
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Cilantro
8    To 16 Tomatilloes depending
On size.
12    Chiles (2_Serranos +
2    _Jalapenos + 8_Piquins) I
Typically use
The serranos and jalapenos
Roast above ingredients in a[n oil-free] cast iron pan, turning
occasionally.  Leave husks on tomatillos while you roast 'em.  The
husks will be nicely blackened, the skins translucent, and the fruits
soft when they're done.  [Let me add: the goal is to blacken the skin
while doing the least tomatillo-exploding that you can. That way they
don't lose juice into the pan, that burns and smells sometimes. That
means moving them around the pan as they roast.]

Put roasted vegetables in food processor with: Salt 1/2 Teaspoon
Cilantro 1/4 Cup and process briefly.

Transfer to a pot, and cook the mixture for 5 minutes.  [This darkens
it up a bit, and mellows the flavors.  It tastes too raw otherwise.]

him e-mail at work, requesting the recipe.  Here's the (slightly
