Title: Fried Pineapple and Orange Tacos with Grated Chocolate
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Dark brown sugar
4 tb Butter
1 1/2 tb Confectioners' sugar
6    Corn or flour tortillas
1/2 md Pineapple; peeled, cored,
-cut into 1/4" dice
2    Oranges; peeled, seeded,
-sliced into 1/4"-thick
-quarter rounds
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPINGS-------------------------------
2 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
-finely grated
1 1/2 c  Heavy (whipping) cream
1/2 c  Shredded fresh mint leaves
1.  Place the pineapple and orange pieces in a large, non-reactive
frying pan.  Sprinkle with the brown sugar.  Cook over medium-high
heat until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes.  Turn and cook on
the other side until the liquid evaporates and the pieces are
browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove and set aside.

2.  Place 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1/2 tablespoon of the
confectioners' sugar in a frying pan large enough to hold a tortilla.
Set over medium-high heat until the butter and sugar melt.  Stir. Add
a tortilla and fry for 30 seconds.  Turn and fry on the other side
until browned and slightly crispy, 30 to 45 seconds more. Remove.
Continue with the remaining tortillas, adding more butter and sugar
to the pan as needed.

3.  To assemble, beat the cream until soft peaks form.  Spread about
1/3 cup of the pineapple-orange mixture in the center of a
sugar-coated tortilla.  Top with whipped cream, mint leaves, and a
sprinkling of grated chocolate.  Fold and serve.

TIP:  The pineapple and orange can be fried in advance, refrigerated
overnight, and served cold.
