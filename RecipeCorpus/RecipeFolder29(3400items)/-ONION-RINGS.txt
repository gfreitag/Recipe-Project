2    Egg whites, beaten to soft

"Some say the Diner has the best onion rings in town.  One of our
secrets is to prepare each one individually. I don't know how many
people actually deep-fry at home, but these onion rings are certainly
worth the effort. They're good with steaks or chops, sandwiches or
soups, or all by themselves."

Peel the onions, being careful to remove all the dry papery skin, and
cut them into 1/2"-thick slices.  Only use the large outer rings,
reserving the small inner rings for another use.

In a deep bowl, combine the flour, water, cayenne, salt and pepper,
and mix thoroughly.  Fold in the beaten egg whites gently until the
batter is light and fluffy.  The bread crumbs need to be very, very
fine; if necessary, put them through a fine sieve, and then into a
wide container that's good for dipping.

Hook an onion ring on our finger and dip it in the batter, shaking
off the excess.  Dip it into the bread crumbs, coat thoroughly, and
shake off excess.  Place the breaded onion rings on a cookie sheet.
When you run out of room, you can layer them up, separating each
layer with parchment or waxed paper.

In a deep-fryer, heat the oil to 375 degrees and fry for 2 1/2
minutes.  If you do not have a deep-fryer, heat the peanut oil in a
cast-iron skillet and fry the rings, turning them as necessary, until
golden brown and crisp.
