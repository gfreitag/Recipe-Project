Title: Cheese Bread
Categories: Breads, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Salt
1 c  Sharp Cheddar Cheese,
Grated
1 pk Active Dry Yeast
1 c  Lukewarm Milk
2 tb Butter
3 c  Flour
1. Combine the yeast and milk, stir, and leave for 15 mins to
dissolve.

2. Melt the butter, let cool, and add to yeast mixture.

3. Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the
center and pour in the yeast mixture.

4. With a wooden spoon, stir from the center, incorporating flour
with each turn, to get a rough dough. If dough seems too dry, add 2-3
Tbs water.

5. Transfer to floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.
Return to bowl, cover, and leave to rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, 2 to 3 hrs.

6. Grease a 9 x 5-inch bread pan. Punch down dough with your fist.
Knead in the cheese, distributing it as evenly as possible.

7. Twist the dough by grasping both ends and twisting each end in the
opposite direction 180 degrees. Form into a loaf shape and place in
the prepared pan, tucking the ends under. Leave in a warm place until
dough rises above the rim of the pan.

8. Preheat oven to 400 F. Bake for 15 mins, then lower the heat to
375 F and bake until the bottom sounds hollow when tapped, about 30
mins more. Cool on a wire rack.
