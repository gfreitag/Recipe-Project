Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 9 servings
2 c  Potatoes, minced
2 c  Milk
2 c  Mocha mix or cream
3 ea Cans cream style corn
2 tb Margarine
3 ea Bacon slices, diced
1/2 c  Onion, minced
1/2 c  Celery, minced
2 c  Water
3 ts Chicken bullion
Fry diced bacon until crisp, remove from pan.  Add minced onion and
celery to bacon grease and saute until limp.  Combine above in slow
cooker pot with water, bullion, potatoes, margarine and cream style
corn.  Cover and cook on low 7 to 9 hours.  Add milk and cream, cook

Mocha mix makes this soup extremely rich tasting, and the
Mocha mix does not curdle with high heat like regular milk or cream.
