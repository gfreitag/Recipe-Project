******************************** ***** Chocolate Pecan Flan *****
********************************

Start by making crust.  Mix the flour, sugar and cocoa and cut in the
butter anbd shortening until mixture is mealy.  Add water and mix
lightly until mixture forms a ball.  If using a food processor, mix
the flour, sugar and cocoa and add the butter and shortening in small
pieces, pulsing on and off until the mixture is crumbly.  Then add
water and pulse just until mixture forms a ball.  This pastry is
difficult to roll so just pat it into a flan pan with removable ring
or a 9-inch pie plate. Chill 30 minutes.  Don't pierce.

When crust is chilled, fill with pecan halves.  Mix remaining filling
ingredients and pour over pecans.  The nuts will rise to the top
during baking.  Bake pie in 350 F oven for 35-40 minutes, just until
centre is set.  Cool pie.

For glaze, melt chocolate over hot water or in microwave and blend in
cream.  Pour mixture over the cooled pie, tilting the pan so the glaze
covers the entire surface of the pie.  Decoreate the pie with a ring
of crushed pecans around the outer edge, or with a ring of whipped
cream. Place pecan halves equidistant around the perimeter of the pie.
