==== ==== Potato Filling 2 pounds potatoes (6 medium) 1/2 pound
butter Salt and Pepper to taste 1 minced onion (optional) Cook
potatoes till tender, drain well.  Add butter, salt and pepper, onion
and mash. When mixture is cool it is ready to use. Note: You may wish
to combine cheese, or sauerkraut with potatoes; if so, it is best to
combine 2/3 mashed potatoes to 1/3 other ingredients. Sauerkraut 2
pound sauerkraut 1 large onion (thinly sliced) Sugar to taste Salt
and pepper to taste 1/2 pound diced bacon (optional) or 1/2 pound
diced salt pork (optional) or 1/2 pound butter (optional) Fresh
shredded cabbage (optional) Diced mushrooms (optional) Rinse
sauerkraut and drain well.  Saute sauerkraut along with the onions in
butter, bacon or salt pork for approximately 20 minutes on low heat,
in a covered pan, stirring from time to time. Add salt, pepper, sugar
(mushrooms if desired). Cool. * It doesn't say what to do with the
shredded cabbage. Meat Filling 1-1/2 pounds ground beef or ground
beef and pork 2 large onions (finely chopped) 1/2 pound butter,
divided Salt and Pepper to taste 1 cup chopped mushrooms (optional) 4
tbsp. sour cream (optional) Saute meat in 1/3 of butter till almost
fully cooked.  (Meat should not be overcooked.) Drain. Use balance of
butter and saute onion till crystal clear. Add meat, seasonings and
optional ingredients to taste. Let mixture cool. Note from me:  A
friend of mine had given me a recipe once for potato filling that
called for mashed potatoes, onions sauteed until beginning to lightly
brown and American cheese.  I usually just add cheese until the
mixture tastes good.  But since it is a lot of work to roll out the
dough one day I decided to cook some wide egg noodles, toss them in
butter in a pan until they browned a little and mix with the filling.
I put it all in a casserole and heated it in the oven.  It's not
authentic, but it is easy.
