1. Make the kim chee by adding the salt to water. Add the won bok and
soak for 2 hours. Drain the mixture and add the remaining kim chee
ingredients. Let stand for 2 hrs.

2. To make the poke: Chop 2 cups of kim chee into fine pieces and mix
with ahi, onion, shoyu and sesame oil.

3. Make the 'taco' shells. Pour 4 inches of oil into a deep skillet
or pot and heat until bubbling.Toss in a rice paper sheet. Use a
large metal whisk push the sheet down in the oil. The rice paper will
form itself into a taco shell around the whisk. Fry 45 to 60 secs.;
the rice paper should be translucent and bubbled. Remove and drain.
Proceed with the rest of the rice paper.

4. Make the avocado sauce by combining all the ingredients and whirl
in a blender or processor until smooth. (To keep the sauce from
darkening, place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the sauce until
needed.)

5. Fill the shells with the kim chee mixture and serve with avocado
sauce.
