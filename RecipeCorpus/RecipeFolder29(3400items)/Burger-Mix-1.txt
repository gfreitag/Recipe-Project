Title: Burger Mix 1
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Sandwich
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Whole wheat bread crumbs
1/4 c  Cornmeal
1 1/2 tb Baking soda
x  Seasonings of your choice
(see note)
1/2 c  Dry chickpeas
1/2 c  Dry soybeans
1/2 c  Dry lentils
1/2 c  Yellow split peas
1/2 c  Brown rice
1/2 c  Rolled oats
Put the ingredients 1-2 at a time in a blender, turn the blender on,
and RUN FOR COVER (this is pretty noisy <g>).  When everything is in
powdered form, combine in a tupperware container and store in the
fridge. Makes 4 cups of mix.

To make burgers, combine 1 c. burger mix and 2/3 c. HOT liquid (see
note 2) and let sit for 15 minutes.  On a plate, form into 3 thin
patties. Use a spatula to move patties onto a nonstick-sprayed
skillet and cook on both sides until lightly browned.  Serve with
your favorite burger fixins.

Note - Seasonings:  You can use the herbs and/or spices of your
choice, or consider using a dry soup mix run through the blender
(I'll bet onion would be good).  Also, try a dry FF salad dressing
mix. Or a veggie boullion cube run through the blender.  Other
suggestions: onion powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper, basil, etc.

Note - Liquids:  Try 1/3 c. water and 1/3 c. barbeque sauce - combine
in bowl and nuke until hot , add to dry mix (note that burgers made
with barbeque sauce will brown more quickly, so watch them!).  Or try
half water, half tomato juice, or half water and half white wine or
marsala. Try to make sure that your liquids and seasonings have
compatible flavors.

Other suggestions:  The possibilities here are endless
:)

Oriental:  Burger mix with a little soy sauce in the liquid and some
fresh ginger added to the mix, maybe a dash of rice wine.

Spanish:  Cumin, red pepper, chili powder, or a dry taco seasoning
mix.

Indian:  Curry powder added to the mix.

Wine/garlic:  Chopped garlic added to the mix, half water and half
white wine for the liquid.

Potpourri:  Make a batch of plain, unseasoned burger mix and add
whatever seasonings strike your fancy as you're mixing it up!  No
need to commit to just one flavor for the whole batch!
