Title: Thyme Lemon Chicken
Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 1 servings  4-6 pieces of chicken 2-3 lemons, juiced (retain the pulp) 3 Tblsp
finely chopped onions (or more. I like more.) 2 tsp ground thyme 1
Tblsp oil 1 Tblsp butter 2 cloves garlic 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 cup flour 1
tsp seasoned salt pepper to taste

Preheat the oven to 350F.

Mix the flour and seasoned salt in a bag. Place each piece of chicken
in the bag and shake to coat. Place skin side down in a preheated
baking dish (cake pan works well) with the butter, melted. Place the
chicken in the oven for 30 minutes.

While the chicken cooks for this first part, prepare the sauce:
Combine the lemon juice and pulp with the onions, thyme, oil and
pepper. Crush the peeled garlic cloves with the salt with a fork. Add
to the lemon sauce.

Take the chicken out of the oven and flip the pieces over. Spoon the
lemon sauce over the chicken, making sure the onions stick to the
chicken. Return to the oven until the chicken is no longer pink in
the middle -- one hour should do. (Covering the baking dish is
optional). Submitted By FLORENCE THOMPSON   On   03-27-95
