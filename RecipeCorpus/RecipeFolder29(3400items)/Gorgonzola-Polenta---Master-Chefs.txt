Title: Gorgonzola Polenta - Master Chefs
Categories: Basics, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 6 servings
-- crumbled PLUS 6 thin
-- 1-inch square slices
1/3 c  Raisins, golden
Nutmeg, fresh, ground
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
Breadcrumbs, fine
3 c  Milk
3 tb Butter, unsalted
3/4 c  Cornmeal
3 tb Cream, sour
2 1/2 tb Cheese, Gruyere, grated
2 1/2 tb Cheese, Parmesan, grated
1/3 c  Cheese, Gorgonzola,
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a
boil. Add the cornmeal in a thin stream, whisking constantly.  When
mixture becomes very thick, continue to boil while stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon, until very thick and smooth (about 5
minutes.)

Stir in the sour cream, grated Gruyere, Parmesan, crumbled
Gorgonzola, raisins, and a little nutmeg, beating until smooth.
Remove from heat; add salt and pepper to taste.

Spoon the cornmeal mixture into 6 1/2-cup ramekins, or custard
cups, tapping molds gently on work surface to settle mixture, and
smoothing tops with spatula.  Cool at least 15 minutes.

Use a knife to loosen polenta from ramekins and unmold onto a
generously buttered baking dish.  Place a slice of Gorgonzola on top
of each; sprinkle with a fine layer of breadcrumbs.  Bake in 450 F
oven (along with quail, if desired) for 10 to 12 minutes, then broil
just until lightly golden.  Serve immediately.
