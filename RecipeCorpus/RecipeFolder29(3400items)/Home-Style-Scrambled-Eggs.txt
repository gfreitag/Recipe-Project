Title: Home Style Scrambled Eggs
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 3 servings
1/4 c  Butter
1 c  Diced tomatoes
1 c  Diced cooked potatoes
1/2 c  Chopped green peppers
4    Eggs
3 tb Minced onion
3/4 ts Salt
3 tb Water
Beat eggs, onion, salt and water.  Melt butter in a large skillet over
medium heat; cook and stir vegetables in butter for 2 minutes.  Pour
egg mixture over vegetables.  As mixture begins to set at the bottom
and side, gently lift cooked portions with spatula so that thin,
uncooked portion can flow to the bottom.  Avoid constant stirring.
Cook eggs until thickened throughout but still moist, about 3 to 5
minutes. Randy Rigg Submitted By RANDY RIGG   On   04-16-95
