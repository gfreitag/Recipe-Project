For Aushak Dough:  In a food processor, mix together flour and salt.
With machine running, add water and process until dough leaves sides
of work bowl.  Divide dough, cover or wrap in plastic wrap, and let
rest 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare filling.  Remove and discard roots and darkest
green parts of leeks.  Wash off all traces of dirt.  Finely chop
leeks and fry in 1 teaspoon oil until soft.  Stir in chile powder and
salt; set aside to cool.

For sauce, place oil in a pan set over low heat.  Add cumin seeds and
cook for a two or three minutes, stirring frequently, until seeds are
browned and oil is fragrant.  Add tomato sauce or puree, cardamom
pod, hot chile powder, and salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer gently
over low heat until aushaks are ready to serve.

To assemble:  On a floured surface, thinly roll out half of dough to
form a rectangle about 12 x 18 inches.  Cut dough into 3-inch
squares, fill each with a generous teaspoon of leeks, fold over and
seal to form triangles. Repeat with remaining half of dough.  When
all aushaks are filled, cook half of them in rapidly boiling water
for 10 minutes. Remove to colander or strainer, and boil remaining
aushaks in the same way. Drain well and place on serving platter.
Ladle sauce over and serve hot.
