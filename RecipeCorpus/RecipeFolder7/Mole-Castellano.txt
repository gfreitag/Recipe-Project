Prepare the chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano
Picante. Place the turkey pieces in a flameproof casserole with a cover;
add the stock and bouquet garni. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and
cook for 1 hour, or until almost tender. Remove from heat, and cool the
turkey in the stock. Place all the nuts, the sesame seeds, garlic, tomato,
coriander seed, and prepared chiles in the electric blender, and reduce to
a coarse puree. Heat the lard in a skillet, and cook the puree for 5
minutes, stirring constantly. Remove the turkey from the casserole, and
strain the stock. Add the stock and sugar to the puree. Taste for
seasoning. Rinse out the casserole; return the turkey and cover with the
sauce. Cook over a very low heat until the meat is tender when pierced with
a fork (about 15 minutes), and the sauce has the consistency of heavy
cream.
