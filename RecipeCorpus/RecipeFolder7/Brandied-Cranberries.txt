1 lb Cranberries

Wash and drain cranberries.  Place in a jelly roll pan or on a cookie sheet
with sides.  Sprinkle with sugar until berries are covered. Broil, stirring
several times for first few minutes, 6-8 inches below burner.  (Stirring
prevents sugar from crystallizing.)  Continue broiling until berries have
popped, this takes several minutes.  Pour into a storage container and add
generous amount of brandy.  Stir lightly, cover and refrigerate.  Will keep
indefinitely in refrigerator. Good with turkey or chicken.  Makes about 6
cups.
