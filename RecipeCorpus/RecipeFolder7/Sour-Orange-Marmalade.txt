From: Arizona Cookbook

Remove the peel from two oranges. Slice this peel very thin and cover with
water. Boil until tender, adding additional water as it boils away. (Change
the water often if the flavor becomes too bitter.)

Peel the remaining oranges (the peel may be stored in freezer for later
grating uses). Boil the pulp in 2 qts. water until very soft. Strain
through a bag with pressure. Re-strain without pressure. Mix this juice
with the drained peel, the sugar, and the salt and boil until the jelly
stage is reached. Let stand until slightly cool. Stir and pour into hot
sterilized jars and seal with paraffin.
