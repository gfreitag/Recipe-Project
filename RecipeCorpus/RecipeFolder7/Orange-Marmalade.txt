granulated sugar

Measure oranges and lemons together. Add 5 times as much cold water. During
next 24 hours, boil hard for an hour. This will reduce the quantity
one-half. Measure into 4-cup units. <Cooking in this quantity will produce
better flavor.> If oranges are overly sweet, add 1 tbsp lemon juice for
every cup of fruit. Bring to boiling point. Boil 8 minutes. Add 3/4 cup
sugar for each cup of fruit.

Boil first unit rapidly until it jells -- not more than 10 min. If a longer
time seems to be necessary, boil the next unit for a longer time before the
sugar is added. Pour into sterilized glasses and cover with paraffin when
cold.
