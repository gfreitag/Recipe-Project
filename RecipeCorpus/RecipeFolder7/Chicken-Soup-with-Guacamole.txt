Categories: Soups/stews, Mexican, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
Salt; to taste
2 qt Chicken soup
1/2 c  Rice*
----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
1    Chile serrano; minced
2 tb Cilantro; chopped
2    Lime, Mexican
2    Avocado, med
1    Tomato, large; diced
4    Scallion; w/top, sliced
Make the chicken soup from a well-grown hen with pieces of meat, skinned
and boned, left in.  The pieces should be fairly large; this is a main-
dish soup.  *The rice should be cooked in the soup.

Peel and slice the avocados, and cut into 1" pieces.  The chiles are best
chopped fine in a blender.  Halve the limes.

Pour soup into hot earthenware cazuelas, or onion-soup pots, and spoon on
the uncooked topping.  Serve with hot tortillas.
