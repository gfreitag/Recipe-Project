Place the beans in a saucepan and mash with a potato masher.  Add the
cooked rice, spices, and water.  Heat 5 to 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, prepare
the vegetables.  Heat the tortillas quickly (just to soften) in a preheated
skillet, toaster oven, or microwave.  Place a line of bean mixture down the
middle of each tortilla.  Top with lettuce, scallions, tomato, and salsa.
Tuck in the top and bottom edges, roll into a burrito, and serve
immediately, topped with additional salsa if desired.
