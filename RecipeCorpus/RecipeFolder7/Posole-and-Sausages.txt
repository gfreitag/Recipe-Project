Categories: Mexican, Sausages
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt; or as desired
1/2 ts Black pepper; or to taste
1 1/2 c  Hominy liquid
2 tb Chopped parsley
Lime slices
6    Hot Italian style sausages
2 md Onions; roughly diced
3    Green (unripe) tomatoes
1 tb Tomato paste
2 c  Cooked hominy

CUT EACH SAUSAGE INTO 4 PIECES. Place in a 3-quart pot, place over medium
heat on the stove and cook, 5 minutes. Pour off and discard fat and reserve
the sausages on a plate. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, 5
minutes, or until the onion softens. Halve tomatoes cross- wise, lay each
half cut side down and cut each half into 6ths. Add the tomatoes and tomato
paste to the pot and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the hominy, oregano,
salt, pepper and hominy water. Cover, raise heat to high, and bring to a
boil. Lower heat to medium and simmer 20 minutes. When it's time to get
dinner on the table, replace the sausages in the pot and cook 7 minutes.
Remove from the heat and add the parsley. Divide the ingredients between 4
soup bowls and garnish with lime slices. Serve warm tortillas instead of
bread.
