Yield: 1 servings
5 c  Distilled malt vinegar
2 ts Caraway seeds
1    Red cabbage (2 lb)
3 tb Pickling salt
2 tb Pickling Spice

Put Pickling Spice and vineagr into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and boil 3
minutes. Remove from heat and cool. When cool, strain and reserve liquid.
Meanwhile, wash 4 pint jars in hot soapy water; rinse. Keep hot until
needed. Prepare lids as manufacturer directs.

Rinse cabbage well under cold running water. Drain thoroughly and mix with
caraway seeds. Pack cabbage into hot jars. Pour cold spiced vinegar over
cabbage to cover completely. Wipe rims of jars with a clean damp cloth.
Attach lids and place in canner. Process 10 minutes in a boiling-water
bath. Store in a cool dry dark place at least 5 days before serving.

NOTE: Use cabbage within 2 months; if left longer cabbage loses its
crispness. Garnish with an Italian parsley sprig, if desired, and serve as
an accompaniment to cold meats and poultry.
