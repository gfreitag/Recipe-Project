Stuffing<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Heat 1 tb oil in heavy large non-stick skillet over high heat.  Add
potatoes and cook until golden, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Reduce
heat to low. Add chili powder and cumin and cook 2 minutes. Add tomatoes,
sliced green onions and tomato sauce. Cover and cook until potatoes are
tender, about 6 minutes. Add 1/3 c Jack cheese, egg, cilantro, and jalapeno
and stir until cheese melts. Season with salt and cayenne.

Brush large skillet with oil and place over medium heat.  Add 1 tortilla
and cook until softened, 30 seconds per side.  Transfer to work surface.
Top tortilla with 1/3 cup filling and roll up. Place seam side down in
baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling, brushing skillet
with oil as necessary. (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour enchilada sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle
with feta and remaining 1 1/3 cups Jack cheese.  Cover with foil. Bake
until heated through and bubbling, about 30 minutes. Serve with sour cream
and green onions.

Note: Although I'm sure that the _Bon Appetite_ chefs know exactly what
they are talking about, I find that, at high temperatures, olive oil breaks
down a great deal, begins to smoke, and sets off fire alarms all over. I
use peanut oil and a wok to saute potatoes since, as far as skillets go, I
don't have non-stick and heavy all in one.  Additionally, I don't use any
extra salt in the dish, finding it amply seasoned without.
