Huevos Revueltos a La Mexicana (Mexican Scrambled Eggs)

SERVES 4

This is the simplest and most popular way of cooking eggs in the Mexican
manner.

Break the eggs into a bowl and just mix (do not beat) with the salt. Heat
the lard in a large frying pan. Add the tomatoes, onions, and fresh chiles,
stir well, and fry over medium heat, stirring from time to time, for about
3 to 4 minutes or until most of the juice has been absorbed. Stir in the
eggs and continue stirring and turning them over until the eggs are set -
about 4 minutes. Serve immediately with corn tortillas.
