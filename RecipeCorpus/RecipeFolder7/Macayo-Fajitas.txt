Macayo Fajitas

(This basic fajita recipe is from the Johnson family which owns the Macayo
chain.) **

Chopped fresh cilantro
and sliced

For marinade, in a large bowl, whisk together salt, pepper, lime, garlic
and vegetable oil.  Put meat in marinade and set aside for at least one
hour.

Heat oven to 200 degrees; set tortillas in for 1 to 3 minutes, to warm.
Remove and put in a covered basket.

Heat a large skillet and add olive oil.  Add marinated meat and saute until
onion becomes transluscent.

Place cooked meat in a large bowl or platter and serve with tortillas,
toppings and garnishes.

For each fajaita, fill a tortilla with meat and desired amounts of
garnishes and toppings and roll up like a burrito.

Serve with refried beans, black beans or Spanish rice. Make 4 to 6
servings.

VARIATIONS: For spicier marinade, add cayenne pepper or crushed dry red
chili pepper. Instead of lime juice, try pineapple juice, papaya juice,
beer, wine or barbecue sauce.*

*(Cooks note:) I like to use tequila, and marinate myself a bit while I'm
doing the cooking. It makes it much easier to roll up like a burrito. It is
the unrolling that becomes a bit difficult.
