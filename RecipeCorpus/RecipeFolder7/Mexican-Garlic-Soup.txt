Categories: Soups/stews, Mexican, Garlic
Yield: 6 servings
Salt & pepper
4    Eggs
2 tb Crumbled Asadero cheese
1 tb Chopped parsley
10    Cloves garlic
1/2 ts Flour
2 tb Butter
1 qt Beef or chicken stock
Mash garlic as fine as possible, add flour and saute in butter. (A clay pot
is preferred for this.)  Add soup stock and boil 15 minutes. Strain and
return to fire. Add seasonings. With soup at boil, slip eggs in gently so
the yolk doesn't break. When eggs are poached, serve in bowls with one egg
per bowl and parsley and cheese on top.
