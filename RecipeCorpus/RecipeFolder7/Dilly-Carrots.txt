Scrub carrots and trim ends if dark.  Heat the water, vinegar, garlic,
pepper flakes, dill seeds and salt in a large saucepan to a rolling boil.
Add carrots and heat to simmering.  Reduce heat and simmer covered for 10
minutes.  Using tongs, arrange carrots in hot sterilized pint jars.  To
sterilize jars, submerge in water and gently boil 10 minutes; leave in hot
water until ready to use.  Ladle hot vinegar mixture into jars, covering
carrots and distributing spices evenly.  Tuck fresh dill between carrots.
Cover jars tightly with new lids; let cool.  Store in refrigerator 2-3
days.  Flavor improves with storage.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
