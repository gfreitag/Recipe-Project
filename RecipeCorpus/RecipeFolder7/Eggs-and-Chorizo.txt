Categories: Mexican, Cheese/eggs, Pork/ham, Chorizo, Sausages
Yield: 6 servings
8 ea Eggs; Large
1/4 c  Half-and-Half
1/2 ts Oregano Leaves; Dried
1/4 c  Onion; Chopped, 1 Sm.
2 tb Vegetable Oil
8 oz Chorizo Sausage; Bulk
Cook and stir the onion in oil in a 10-inch skillet until tender but not
brown.  Add the sausage, cooking and stirring , until the sausage is done
then drain.  Mix the eggs, half-and-half and the oregano well with a fork.
Pour into the sausage mixture in the skillet.  Cook over medium heat.  As
the mixture begins to set at the bottom and sides, gently lift the cooked
portion with a fork or spatula so that the uncooked egg mixture can run
under the cooked portion.  Avoid constant stirring as this will make the
eggs tough and hard.  Cook until all the eggs are cooked but still moist,
about 3 to 5 minutes.
