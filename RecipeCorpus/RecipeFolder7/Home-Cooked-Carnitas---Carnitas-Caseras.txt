Jim Vorheis
4 tb Lard
3 lb Pork, cut into 2-inch cubes
1/2 md White onion, roughly sliced
4    Fresh marjoram sprigs, or
-scant 1/4 tsp dried
4    Fresh thyme sprigs, or scant
Heat the lard in a heavy pan, add the meat, and fry, stirring and turning
it over from time to time, until lightly golden - about 8 minutes. Add the
onion and stir well.  Cook for 8 minutes longer or until the meat is well
browned (remove onion only if it has burned). Add the remaining
ingredients, cover the pan, and cook over low heat until the meat is just
tender, not falling apart - about 20 minutes, depending on the quality of
the meat.  There should be plenty of pan juices. Remove the lid, increase
the heat, and fry, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the
juices have been absorbed - about 10 minutes.  Drain off the extra fat and
serve.
