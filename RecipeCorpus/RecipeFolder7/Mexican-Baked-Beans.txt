-cloves garlic)
29 oz Can crushed tomatoes
1 1/2 tb Chili powder
1 ts Cumin
1/4 c  Molasses
Salt and pepper to taste
2 c  Dried white beans
Water
3    Jalapeno peppers, chopped
1    Green or red pepper, chopped
1    Onion, chopped
1 ts Garlic powder (or 2-3 minced
Cover the beans with water and soak overnight.  In the morning, drain the
beans and cover with fresh water.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for about
an hour.

Place the peppers, onion, garlic powder or garlic in a saucepan and heat,
covered, over low heat (no need for oil, the vegetable juices that are
released will keep everything from sticking to the pan.)  Add the tomatoes
and spices and molasses, and simmer for about ten minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Drain the beans and place them in a large casserole dish.  Pour the tomato
mixture over, and stir gently until beans and sauce are mixed.  Bake,
uncovered, for 3 hours, until mixture is no longer soupy, and beans are
soft.  Serves 6.

Served with 1/2 cup of rice, you have a complete protein, and the dish
racks up only 446 calories per serving and a measly 1.35 g fat.  Another
suggestion would be to use cooked corn - it adds the same number of
calories as the rice, and only 1 g fat to the existing 1 and a smidge.  And
it's yummy, too.
