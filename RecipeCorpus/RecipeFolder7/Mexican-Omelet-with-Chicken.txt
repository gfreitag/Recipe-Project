8 ea Eggs; Large
1/4 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
4 tb Margarine Or Butter
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Tomato; Peeled & Seeded,1 Md

1 c  Cooked Chicken Or Turkey; *
* The chicken or turkey should be chopped into small chunks. In a blender
container, combine the 1/4 cup of water, tomato, oil, chili powder, and
chicken bouillon granules.  Blend until very smooth.  Transfer to a small
saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, until thick, about 7 minutes. Stir in
the chicken or turkey.  Season with a little salt and pepper. Keep warm.
With a fork, beat the eggs with the second 1/4 cup of water, the salt and
pepper, until well blended but not frothy.  In an 8-inch omelet pan heat 1
Tbls of the butter until it sizzles and browns slightly. Tilt the pan to
coat the bottom and sides.  Pour about 1/2 cup of the egg mixture, leaving
the heat on medium-high.  As the egg sets, lift the edges to allow the
uncooked portion on top to run under the cooked portion. Continue until all
of the egg is cooked.  Spoon about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture down the
center of the omelet.  Fold the sides of the omelet up over the chicken
mixture.  Tilt the omelet pan to roll the omelet over and out onto a hot
plate.  Repeat with the remaining butter, egg mixture and chicken filling,
three more times and serve hot.
