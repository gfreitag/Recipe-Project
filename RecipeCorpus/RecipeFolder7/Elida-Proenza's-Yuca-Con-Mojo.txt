Cut the yuca into 2-in pieces and peel with a paring knife.  Cut the large
pieces in half so that all are of uniform size.  Bring ar least 2 quarts
salted water to a boil.  Add the yuca and cook for 20 minutes or until
cracks begin to appear in the center (of the yuca) Add 1 c cold water. Cook
the yuca for 5-10 more minutes, or until very soft.

Meanwhile, make the mojo.  Finely chop the garlic, and, in a mortar and
pestle, pound it to a paste with the salt and pepper. Stir in the lime
juice and correct the seasoning. Just before serving, heat the olive oil in
a small frying pan and pour it into the garlic mixture. Stand back - it may
spatter.

Drain the yuca and pull out any fibers.  Arrange on a platter or plates and
pour the hot mojo on top.  Garnish the yuca with thinly sliced onion and
serve
