Title: Grandma's Pickled Beets
Categories: Pickles
Yield: 10 servings
Pinch of salt
Pinch of pepper
2 cn Small beets (10 oz cans)
1/2 c  White vinegar
3/4 c  White sugar
This recipe was handed down from my Grandmother of German extraction. It's
origin is unknown.

In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar to boil and add the sugar slowly
until dissolved - stir constantly. Open the cans of beets and retain the
juice from one can. Add the beets (whole) to the boiling vinegar/sugar
solution and bring back to a boil. Add the retained beet juice (about 1/4
cup worth). Add salt & pepper. Boil for about 2 minutes and then remove
from heat.

Sterilize two sealing jars (about 10 - 12 oz capacity).

Put beets into sterlized jars, cover with the vinegar/sugar solution and
seal with lids.

Let stand several days before serving.

This is a sweet pickle best served cold.  Excellent with beef and pork.
