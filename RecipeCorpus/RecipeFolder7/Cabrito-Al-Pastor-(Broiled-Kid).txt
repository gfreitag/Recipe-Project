ground, and burn down to white coals. Remove kids from water and thread on
spits.  Arrange over the hot coals, and roast for 2 to 3 hours, depending

spits continuously so that the meat cooks evenly, or use a rotisserie. Add
more white coals if necessary.

onion, tomato, cilatro, and chiles.  Serve withj Frijoles de Olla sprinkled
with cheese, totopos, and Pico de Gallo sauce. The kid may be shredded and
