Title: Rangpur Lime Marmalade
Categories: Condiment, Preserve
Yield: 6 servings
4 1/2 c  Sugar (2 1/4 lbs)
12 sm Rangpur limes
5    Lemons
Makes about 6 half-pints. Wash and remove the seeds of the limes and lemons
and put fruits through a food chopper or cut in small pieces. Measure the
pulp and add 3 cups of water for each cup of pulp; let stand overnight. The
next morning, boil the mixture, uncovered, in a preserving kettle about 20
minutes.  Remove mixture to a bowl, cover and let stand again overnight The
next morning, measure citrus mixture. Cooking batches of only 4 to 6 cups
of fruit at a time, measure out 3/4 cup of sugar for each cup of fruit and
combine fruit and sugar in a preserving kettle.  Bring mixture slowly to a
boil, stirring frequently until sugar has dissolved. Then boil rapidly for
about 20 minutes until jellying point is reached. Test for jellying point
with a jelly thermometer which should read 200 to 222 F, or with a spoon
which, when dipped into mixture, has 2 drops form along the edge, come
together and fall as 1 drop. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and seal
immediately.

To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe the
rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all particles
of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover with a 1/8-inch
layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add another layer of melted
paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to sea/l completely. Jams and
