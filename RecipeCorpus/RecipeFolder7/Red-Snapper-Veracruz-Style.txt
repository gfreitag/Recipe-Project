peel and set aside.  Combine flour, salt and pepper. Coat fish fillets on
both sides with the seasoned flour mixture. In a large skillet, cook fish
fillets in hot oil for about 5 minutes per side or until done. Remove
fillets from the skillet and set aside. Drain off the remaining oil,
reserving 1 Tbls.  In the same skillet, cook the onion and garlic in the
reserved oil until tender but not brown. Add the tomato puree, olives,
water, lime juice, jalapeno pepper (if used), sugar, cinnamon, cloves and
the bay leaf mixing well. Add the potatoes, bring to boiling then reduce
the heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 5 minutes. Add the fish fillets
and cook about 5 minutes or until fish fillets are heated through. Remove
the bay leaf. Arrange the fish fillets and potatoes on a serving platter,
spoon the sauce over all. garnish platter with triangles of buttered toast
