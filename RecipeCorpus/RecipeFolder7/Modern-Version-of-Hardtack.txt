Title: Modern Version of Hardtack
Categories: Appetizers, Mexican
Yield: 6 servings
Sesame Seeds (optional)
Seasoned Salt (optional)
Caraway Seeds (optional)
Onion Flakes (optional)
1 3/4 c  Water
2 c  White Flour
1/2 c  Wheat Germ
1 tb Sugar
2 c  Masa Harina
1/2 c  Quick-cooking Oats
1 tb Salt
Mix all dry ingredients thoroughly.  Add water.  Mix with hands until well-
moistened but not sticky.  Divide into 4 parts, roll out each quarter until
1/4 inch thick, place on cookie sheet (each part should cover half a cookie
sheet).  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  Score with a knife before baking, if
desired.  Break into pieces as needed.  Keeps indefinitely in air-tight,
moisture-proof containers.  Zip-lock bags are good for carrying hard-tack
in a backpack.
