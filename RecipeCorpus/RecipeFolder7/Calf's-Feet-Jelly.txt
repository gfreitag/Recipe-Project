reduced, strain, allowed to get cold, then all fat and skimmings removed,
the liquor which should have become like jelly then put back into a bright

and lemon juice, brought slowly to the boil without stirring, then allowed
to simmer till the coagulation turns a grey color, about twenty minutes ,
then strained and restrained through a jelly bag; when nearly cool, filled
