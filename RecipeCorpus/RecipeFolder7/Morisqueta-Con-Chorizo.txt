Jim Vorheis
2 tb Lard or safflower oil
6 oz 3 to 4 inch chorizo, skinned
3 tb Finely chopped white onion
1/2 lb Tomatoes, finely chopped,
Heat the lard in a large frying pan, crumble the chorizo into it, and cook
over low heat, stirring from time to time, until it is well heated through
and beginning to fry.  Remove with slotted spoon and set aside. Remove all
but 3 tablespoons of the fat or add fat to make that amount. Add the onion
and fry for 1 minute or until transparent but not browned. Add the chopped
tomatoes and cook, stirring from time to time, over fairly high heat until
reduced - about 3 minutes.  Stir in the chorizo and rice, add salt to
taste, and keep turning over carefully until the rice is well heated
through and all the flavors are combined.  Serve as a dry soup - alone.
