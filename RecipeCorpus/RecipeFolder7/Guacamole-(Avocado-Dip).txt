Guacamole is prepared differently in various regions  of Mexico. In the
city of Monterrey, it is garnished to reflect the colors of the Mexican
flag.

For the guacamole:

totopos (crisply fried tortilla wedges)

Put avocadoes in a glass bowl, and mash them with a fork.  Add onion,
cilantro, lime juice, zucchini, oil, chiles, and salt. Mix the ingredients
thoroughly to form a puree.

Put the avocado pits in the guacamole to prevent darkening. To serve, spoon
guacamole into a mortar, and decorate with tomato on one side and green
onions, chiles, and cilantro leaves in the center. On the other side, place
the totopos.

Makes 8 servings.
