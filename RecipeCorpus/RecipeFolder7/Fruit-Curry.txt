Categories: Condiment
Yield: 8 servings
2    Peaches, peeled and sliced
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Apple juice
2    Hpg tbs Curry powder
2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ts Lemon peel

1 ts Sea Salt
4 tb Safflower oil
1    Zucchini, sliced in rounds
1 c  Eggplant, cubed
3    Green apples, cored and
-sliced into rings
Combine rice, water and 1 teaspoon salt and steam 1 hour.  Saute onions
with 1 teaspoon salt in oil until onions are tender.  Add zucchini and
eggplant and fry until tender.  Lightly stir in fruits and apple juice,
then add next 4 ingredients.  Simmer 10 minutes. Place steamed rice into a
buttered 3-quart baking dish.  Smother with sauteed mixture.  Cover and
bake at 350 for 25 minutes.  Remove and garnish with peanuts and bananas.
Serve immediately. Serves 8 to 10.

Variations:  For the meat-eating crown, use 1/2 pounds ground lamb or pork
instead of zucchini and eggplant.  When fresh fruits are not available, use
1 11/2 cups dried apples and 3/4 cups dried peaches, reconstituting them in
warm water for 1 hour before using them.
