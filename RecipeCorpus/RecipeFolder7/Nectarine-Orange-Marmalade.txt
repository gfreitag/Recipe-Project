Title: Nectarine-Orange Marmalade
Categories: Condiment
Yield: 4 servings
4 1/2 c  Of sugar (2 1/4 pounds)
3 lb Of nectarines
3    Medium-size oranges
Makes about 4 half-pints. Wash, blanch, peel and pit nectarines; wash the
oranges.  Remove the peel from 1 1/2 of the oranges and discard it. Put the
nectarines and the peeled and unpeeled oranges through a meat grinder.
There should be about 4 1/2 cups.  Place the fruit in a preserving kettle,
add 4 1/2 cups of sugar and bring slowly to a boil. Boil rapidly,
uncovered, for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Skim off foam with a
metal spoon.  Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and seal immediately.

To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe the
rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all particles
of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover with a 1/8-inch
layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add another layer of melted
paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to seal completely.
