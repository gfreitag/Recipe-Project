Can use fat-reduced Swiss or Jack cheese, grated, 2 cups.  Omit salt if
stock is salted.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap tortillas tightly in foil and place in
preheated oven for 15 minutes to soften. While tortillas are warming, cook
onion an dgarlic, covered, over low heat until soft, adding a little water
or stock if necessary to prevent scorching. Add chicken and cook over
medium heat, stiffing frequently until chicken is cooked, about 5 minutes.
Add tomato puree, chilies and salt and mix well. Simmer, uncovered for 10
minutes.

While chicken mixture is simmering, combine stock and dry milk powder in
saucepan and mix thoroughly.  Slowly heat to simmer, stirring frequently.
Dip each tortilla in milk sauce.  Divide chicken filling, spooning 1/4 cup
mixture down the center of each tortilla.

Roll each tortilla around filling and place, seam side down, in glass
baking dish that has been sprayed with non-stick vegetable coating.  Pour
milk sauce over top and bake in 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Remove
from oven and sprinkle grated cheese evenly over top.  Return to oven for
another 5 minutes until cheese is melted.

To serve, place each enchilada on a plate and garnish with fresh cilantro
if desired.  This recipe may also be made in individual au gratin dishes.
