This is the authentic recipe that won in Dole's first recipe contest.
It launched Pineapple Upside Down Cake on its way to fame. It's very
good - and very sweet, as most desserts were in those days.

DIRECTIONS

Drain the juice from 1 large can either Crushed or Sliced Hawaiian
Pineapple. Sift 2 cups flour. Sift again with 2 teaspoons baking
powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cream 1/2 cup butter or substitute,
gradually add 1 cup sugar; cream well. Beat yolks and whites of
2    eggs separately.

Add yolks to creamed mixture; mix well, then add flour and 1/2 cup
milk alternately, mixing well. Fold the 2 beaten egg whites and 1
teaspoon vanilla.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large frying pan. Spread 1 cup of brown
sugar over pan. Add pineapple (if Sliced is used, place slices
closely together on the sugar; if crushed, simply pour in the
well-drained fruit).

Pour cake batter over fruit. Bake 45 minutes. Turn upside-down on
serving dish and garnish with maraschino cherries. Whipped cream may
be spread over top.
