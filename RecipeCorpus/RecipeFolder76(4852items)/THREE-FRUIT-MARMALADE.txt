Here's a marmalade recipe with some really citrus-y pizzazz! This
will make about 12 6-oz. jars... Scrub the fruit and slice very thin,
saving the juice. Discard the seeds and the grapefruit core. Measure
the fruit and juice.  Put the fruit and juice in a large pot and add
three times as much water.  Simmer, covered, for 2 hours, and then
let stand overnight. Measure the fruit and liquid, then add an equal
amount of sugar and a sprinkle of salt.  Cook rapidly, in two or
three batches, until the jellying point (when jelly slides off cold
metal spoon in a sheet rather than in separate droplets) is reached,
stirring frequently. Pour into hot, STERILIZED jars and seal. Susan
