Title: SPICED CRANBERRIES
Categories: Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
1 qt Fresh cranberries
1/2 c  Water
12    Whole cloves
12    Whole allspice
2    Sticks cinnamon, broken
1/8 ts Ground mace
1 c  Brown sugar
Place berries in a covered pot.  Add water. Tie the spices in a little
cheesecloth bag and add to the pot, along with the mace. Cover and
simmer until the fruit is soft and broken, about 25min. Remove the
spice bag and discard.  Run the berries through a food processor or
press through a colander and return to the pan. Stir in the sugar
over heat until dissolved.  Cool in refridgerator before serving.
Serves 6-8 as a condiment.

If you don't mind some texture to your sauce like I do, then I
recommend only coarsely chopping the cranberries in the processor.
I've also replaced the whole spices with small portions of their
ground equivalents.
