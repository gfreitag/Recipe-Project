A baked dessert like this would have been sunk in the embers of the
log fire with a cauldron or pot upturned over it to form a lid... Put
the fruits in a pan or microwave dish with about 1 inch water in the
bottom and cook gently for 10-15 minutes (4-6 minutes in microwave),
or till the fruits are soft without being totally mushy. Sweeten to
taste with honey or brown sugar (Saxons would have used honey); how
much you need will depend on what fruits you have used. drain the
excess juice and save to serve with the pudding. chop the hazelnuts
in a processor or liquidiser until they are almost as fine as the
breadcrumbs, but not quite, then mix the two together. Spoon the
fruit into an ovenproof dish and cover with a thick layer of
hazelnuts and crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven (180C) for 20 to 30
minutes or till the top is slightly cruncy and browned. Serve with
lots of cream or plain yogurt and the warmed fruit juices.
