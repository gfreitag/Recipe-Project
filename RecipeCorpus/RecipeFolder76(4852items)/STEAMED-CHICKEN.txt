RINSE THE CHICKEN under cold running water and blot completely dry
with paper towels. Rub the salt inside the cavity and on the skin of
the chicken. Place the chicken, breast-side down, on a heat-proof
platter, and set aside for 15 minutes. Set up a steamer or put a rack
into a wok or deep pan. Fill the steamer with 2 inches of hot water.
Bring water to a simmer. Put the plate with the chicken into the
steamer or onto the rack. Cover the steamer tightly and gently steam
over medium heat for 1 hour. Replenish the water in the steamer from
time to time. Remove the platter with the cooked chicken and pour off
all the liquid. In a small heat-proof bowl, combine the sugar, salt,
soy sauce, ginger and scallions. Mix well. In a small pan, heat the
peanut and sesame oils until they are smoking. Pour the hot oils over
the ginger mixture. Chop the chicken into serving portions and serve
immediately with the dipping sauce.
