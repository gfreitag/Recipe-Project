Grease bottoms of 12 muffin cups or line pans with paper muffin cups.

In a medium bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda,
cinnamon, nutmeg and mace.

In a small bowl, mix egg, peach yogurt, milk and oil. Make a well
with a spoon in the center of the flour mixture. Pour egg mixture and
chopped dried peaches into the well. Stir until flour mixture is
moistened; the batter should still maintain some lumps in it. Gently
spoon batter into greased muffin pan cups, filling each 2/3 full.

Mix all ingredients for the crunch topping except for the butter; cut
in butter or margarine until crumbly.

Sprinkle each muffin with approximately 2 ts. of the topping.

Bake 20-23 minutes or until golden brown. Remove muffins from the pan
and serve warm.
