Title: SPICED PEARS IN CIDER
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
6 lg Firm pears
1 pt Dry cider; strong
- or red wine
4 oz Sugar
1    Vanilla pod; split
2    Whole cinnamon sticks
1 ts Corn starch; or arrowroot
Flaked almonds; toasted
15 fl Double cream; whipped
Preheat the oven to 250 oF / 130 oC.

Peel the pears neatly, leaving the stalks on, and stand them in a
large casserole.

In a saucepan bring the cider, sugar, split vanilla pod and cinnamon
sticks to the boil.

Pour this over the pears, cover the casserole and bake very slowly for
about 3 hours, turning the pears half-way through the cooking time.

When the pears are cooked, transfer them to a serving bowl and cool.

Pour the liquid into a saucepan, discarding the vanilla pod and
cinnamon sticks.

Mix the arrowroot with a little cold water to a smooth paste, then
add to the saucepan with the liquid. Bring to the boil, stirring till
the mixture has thickened slightly to a syrup.

Pour it over the pears, allow to cool a little, then baste each pear
with a good coating of the syrup.

Place in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly and serve sprinkled with
toasted flaked almonds and whipped cream.
