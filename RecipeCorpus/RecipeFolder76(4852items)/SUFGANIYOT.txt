Title: SUFGANIYOT
Categories: Israeli, Holiday, Doughnuts
Yield: 24 Doughnuts
1/2 c  Margarine
1 c  Flour
1 tb Sugar
4    Eggs
2 qt Vegetable oil for frying
12 oz Fruit preserves
1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
Sufganiyot are small, jelly-filled doughnuts traditionally served in
Israel during Hanukkah. The doughnuts are fried in oil, symbolizing
the miracle that occurred when one day's worth of sacred oil burned
for eight days when the Maccabees returned to their ransacked temple
in Jerusalem some 2,100 years ago.

1. Place margarine and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over
medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Stir in flour and sugar. Cook,
stirring vigorously, just until mixture forms a ball. Remove from
heat.

2. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir until smooth and well-blended.

3. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until it reaches 380
degrees as measured on a deep-fat frying thermometer. Adjust heat
while making pastries to maintain the 380-degree temperature.

4. Carefully drop batter by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls into hot
oil. Fry until puffed and golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.

5. Using a slotted spoon, remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
Remove to wire racks to cool completely.

6. Fill a pastry bag, fitted with a filling tip, with preserves.
Insert tip into each doughnut and squeeze about 1/2 tablespoon of
filling into each.

7. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve. Sufganiyot do not store
well, so are best eaten the day they are made.
