Wash the dal.  In a large non-stick saucepan add the dal, turmeric,

the heat to low and simmer, partially covered for 20-25 minutes,
until the dal is cooked to a thick puree. Stir occasionally to
prevent sticking. Remove from heat.

Heat saute medium in a non-stick skillet or wok.  Add dried red
chilies and stir until they turn light brown. Add mustard seeds, stir
until they crackle. Add cumin. Stir. Add onions, saute until
translucent, 1-2 minutes. Add garlic and green chilies and stir until
onion turns light brown, 2-3 minutes.  Add tomato, stir until the
skin curls. Add dal and 1-1/2 cups water.  Stir, boil and cook for
4-5 minutes until it is a medium soupy consistency.  Add spinach,
cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Add salt, sprinkle with cilantro and
nutmeg.
