Yield: 16 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
3/4 c  Water
2 lg Eggs
1/4 c  Butter, softened
1 pn Saffron* or 2-3drops yellow
Food coloring
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
4 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Salt
4 ts Bread machine yeast
1/3 c  Chopped citron
1/4 c  Chopped blanched almonds
3 ts Grated lemon peel
Green & red candied cherries
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1/2 c  10X Lemon flavored sugar
1/2 c  10X sugar - plain flavor
1 tb Water + as needed
Place all the dough ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order
recommended by the manufacturer, EXCEPT the citron, almonds and lemon
peel.

Process on Dough/Manual cycle. DO NOT USE THE DELAY CYCLE. According
to your machine add the citron, almonds and lemon peel at the raisin
or nuts signal beep or 5 minutes before last kneading cycle ends.

Grease a large cookie sheet. (I prefer the air-cushion type as it
doesn't over brown the bottom of the bread.)

Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 30-inch rope on a lightly
floured pastry board. Place ropes close together on the prepared
cookie sheet. Twist the ropes over each other gently and then loosely
into a circle. Press the ends together to seal. Cover and allow to
rise in a warm place 45-50 minutes or until double in size.

Heat oven to 375 degrees F . Bake ring 20-25 minutes or until golden
brown; cool. Drizzle with Glaze. Garnish with cherries if desired.

Glaze: With a fork blend the sugars together. All of one flavor can
be used if desired.  Add water and mix until smooth and thin enough
to drizzle over the cake. Add or decrease water accordingly.

*To make a SWEDISH CHRISTMAS CROWN: After bread has cooled, make
holes for 6 candles in bread. Drizzle with glaze. Garnish with
cherries and insert candles.
