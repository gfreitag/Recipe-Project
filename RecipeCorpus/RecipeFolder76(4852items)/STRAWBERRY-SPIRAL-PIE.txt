Title: STRAWBERRY SPIRAL PIE
Categories: Pies, Crusts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Strawberries Hulled,Washed
And Drained
(About 4 1/2 Cups)
2/3 c  Strawberry Jam
1 tb Unsalted Butter
1 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Quick Cooking Tapioca
1/2 ts Ground Ginger
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/2 c  Sugar
Biscuit Dough (Check Pies
Pastries)
Preheat the oven to 450, and line the oven floor with foil to catch
any drips. Spread the strawberries on paper towels to dry. In a small
bowl, stir the jam to loosen it. In a saucepan, melt the butter and
keep warm. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch,
tapioca,ginger,cinnamon,nutmeg and sugar.  Halve any very large
berries. Gently toss the berries with the dry ingredients. On a
lightly floured surface, roll out the biscuit dough into a 10x18
rectangle. Square off the corners. Brush the dough lightly with about
half of the melted butter. Using an icing spatula, spread the jam
over the rectangle, leaving a 1/2 inch border on one long side.
Starting at the opposite long side, roll up the dough jelly-roll
fashion and pinch the seam closed. Roll the log so that it is an even
diameter, exactly 18 inches long; turn the log seam side down. Using
a large sharp knife, quarter te log, then cut each quarter into 3
equal pieces so that there will be 12 spiraled biscuits in all. Using
a rubber spatula, fold the strawberry filling once to remix. Spoon
the filling into a 9 inch glass pie plate and smooth the top.
Arrange the pie and the remaining 4 biscuits in the center.  Don't
push the biscuits down into the strawberries. Bake the pie for 20
minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is
bubbling.  Lower the oven temp to 350 loosely cover the pie with foil
and bake for 15 minutes longer. Transfer to a rack to cool for 30
minutes before serving.
