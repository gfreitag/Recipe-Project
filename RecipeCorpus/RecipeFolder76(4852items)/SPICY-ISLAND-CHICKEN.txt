Title: SPICY ISLAND CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Low-fat
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Chicken, cooked
2 1/4 c  Water
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Curry powder
2 ts Lime juice
1 pk Chicken-flavor noodles/sauce
8 oz Green beans, frozen
1 tb Coconut, flaked
Shred chicken.  Stir together water, garlic, curry, and lime juice.
Bring to boil, then stir in noodles and green beans. Continue boiling
over medium heat, stirring occasionally, 7 minutes or until noodles
are tender. Stir in chicken and coconut; heat through.

Sylvia's comments: In spite of its name, this was more flavorful than
spicy.  For a more fiery effect, use more curry powder.
