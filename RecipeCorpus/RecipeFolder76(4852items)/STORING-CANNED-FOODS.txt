Title: STORING CANNED FOODS
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Guide  If lids are tightly vacuum sealed on cooled jars, remove screw bands,
wash the lid and jar to remove food residue; then rinse and dry jars.
Label and date the jars and store them in a clean, cool, dark, dry
place. Do not store jars above 95 degrees F or near hot pipes, a
range, a furnace, in an uninsulated attic, or in direct sunlight.
Under these conditions, food will lose quality in a few weeks or
months and may spoil. Dampness may corrode metal lids, break seals,
and allow recontamination and spoilage.

Accidental freezing of canned foods will not cause spoilage unless
jars become unsealed and recontaminated. However freezing and thawing
may soften food. If jars must be stored where they may freeze, wrap
them in newspapers, place them in heavy cartons, and cover with more
newspapers and blankets.
