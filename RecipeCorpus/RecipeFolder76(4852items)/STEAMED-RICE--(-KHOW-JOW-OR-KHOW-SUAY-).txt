Title: STEAMED RICE  ( KHOW JOW OR KHOW SUAY )
Categories: Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
Rice
Water
This is a fool proof way of cooking any amount of rice.

Wash rice well. Place rice into sauce pan. Add water until it covers
the rice. To gauge the correct amount of water the water should come
up to the first joint of the index finger. Boil the rice until the
rice is at surface level then close the lid and turn the heat down
low. The rice should be cooked in about 10 minutes or when all the
water is absorbed. Check periodically.

I use this method but have a rice cooker. No measuring required. With
the old harder rice add more water.
