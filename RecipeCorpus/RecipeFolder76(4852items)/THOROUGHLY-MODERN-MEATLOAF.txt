Title: THOROUGHLY MODERN MEATLOAF
Categories: Beef, Microwave
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Ground beef; (more or
-less)
3 sl Bread, to 4 sliced
1    Onion; peeled &
-quartered
2 tb Parsley, dried
1 ts Spearmint, dried
1    Garlic clove
1/4 ts Olive oil; for flavor
Salt & pepper; to taste
2 tb Feta; crumbled (more or
-less to taste, opt)
1    Egg; (optional, use less
-bread if omitting)
Tear the bread into a food processor bowl. Pulse until it becomes
crumbs. Toss in the onion, garlic, oil and spices. Pulse to blend and
chop. Add the meat and cheese as small hunks. Process until it forms
a ball that rolls around in the processor bowl. If using the egg, add
it along with the meat or after processing the meat a bit, but before
it forms a ball. Place the meat into a microwave loaf pan. (I use a
pan made for the purpose that has a shelf which holds the meat up out
of the fat.) Micro-cook at 70% for 10 to 15 minutes. Check for
doneness with the instant thermometer (160 F.). I use a turntable. If
you don't have one, you will need to rotate the pan two or three
times during cooking. Slice thin, and serve with yogurt cucumber
dressing (tzatziki), though my husband prefers catsup.
