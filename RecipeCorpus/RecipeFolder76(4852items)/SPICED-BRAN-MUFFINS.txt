Title: SPICED BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Rosie's
Yield: 12 Servings
Light vegetable oil spray
1/2 c  Molasses
2 tb Honey
2 lg Egg whites
1/4 c  Yogurt, plain, nonfat
1/4 c  2% Milk
1/2 c  Wheat bran
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 tb Ground ginger
1 ts Ground cloves
1/4 c  Walnuts, chopped
1/4 c  Golden raisins
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 12-well muffin tin with the
cooking spray. Warm the molasses and honey in a small saucepan over
low heat just until it begins to steam.  Remove the pan from the heat
and set it aside to cool. Whisk the egg whites, yogurt, and milk
together in a large mixing bowl until blended.  Whisk in the
molasses-and-honey mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the bran,
flour, baking powder, and spices. Fold in the walnuts and raisins.
Turn the batter into the prepared muffin tin and bake for 15 to 20
minutes, until a tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes
out clean.  Serve warm.
