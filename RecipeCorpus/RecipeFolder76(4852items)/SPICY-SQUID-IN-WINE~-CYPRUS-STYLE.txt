Title: SPICY SQUID IN WINE~ CYPRUS STYLE
Categories: Greek, Seafood, Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Small squid
1/4 c  Olive oil or corn oil
3    Onions; peeled, sliced
1/4 c  Vinegar
1/2 c  Dry red wine
2    Cinnamon sticks
4    Whole cloves
1    Bay leaf
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and
small sand bag and ink. Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them
inside and out with cold water.  Rinse head and tentacles thoroughly.

Heat the oil in a pan, add the squid, including the tentacles, and
onions, and cook slowly until the onions are translucent. Pour the
vinegar and wine over the squid and onions, then add the remaining
ingredients and enough water to almost cover the squid, if necessary.
Cook, uncovered, over low heat until the squid are tender and all the
wine has been absorbed, approximately 1 to 1 1/4 hours.  Remove the
spices and bay leaf. Cut the squid into bite-sized pieces and serve
warm or cold.
