Wash the fruit, then cook in a saucepan with the water and sugar until
slightly softened. Do not overcook. Remember if you use gooseberries
or currants to begin with them as they take longer to cook than
raspberries, or blackberries. Do not use blue berries. Cut the crusts
off the bread and arrange the slices in the bottom and around the
sides of a 3-cup bowl or mold. Reserve 2 or 2 slices for the top.
Pour the fruit and juice while warm into the bowl. Place the
remaining bread slices on top, trimming to fit. Place a saucer on the
pudding and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Unmold and
garnish with whipping cream and berries. Yield: 6 servings.
