Title: SZECHWAN PEPPERCORN OIL "CHINA MOON"
Categories: Condiments, China
Yield: 2 Cups
6 tb Peppercorns, Szechwan
2 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
2 tb Chile Flakes, dried red
-shockingly pungent
2 1/2 tb Ginger, fresh
- finely minced
2 tb Scallions, green & white
- cut in rings
Heat a large skillet over moderate heat until hot enough to evaporate
a bead of water on contact. Add the Szechwan peppercorns and stir
until toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the heat so the
peppercorns brown without scorching.

Combine the peppercorns and all of the remaining ingredients in a
heavy, non aluminum 1 to 1 1/2 quart saucepan. Rest a deep-fry
thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over moderately low heat, bring
the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees, stirring occasionally. Let
simmer for 15 minutes, checking to ensure the temperature does not
rise. Remove from the heat and let stand until cool or overnight.

Strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the solids.
Store the oil in an impeccably clean glass jar at cool room
temperature.

This oil is particularly good for salads. Its herbal quality also
makes it a nice partner to poultry or beef dishes.
