Title: SQUASH SAMOSAS
Categories: Appetizers, Indian, Vegetables, Mark's
Yield: 24 Samosas
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Wholewheat flour
2 ea Jalapeno chiles, seeded &
-- coarsely chopped
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Oil
Water, as necessary
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 1/2 c  Winter squash, cooked &
-- pureed
2 ts Oil
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts White pepper
2 ea Jalapeno chiles, minced
Salt, to taste
1/3 c  Coconut, shredded
PASTRY:  Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl.  Add oil & slowly
drizzle in water until the dough forms a ball. Knead until very soft
& pliable. Wrap in a damp towel & let rest for 2 hours or so.

FILLING:  Heat oil in a skillet, add the pureed squash & saute,
stirring frequently, for 15 minutes.  Stir in the remaining
ingredients. REmove from heat & let cool.

TO ASSEMBLE:  Divide dough into 12 equal balls.  Roll each ball into a
circle, very thinly, & slice in half. Keep covered with a damp towel
until ready to use, otherwise the pastry will dry out too much & you
will not be able to use it.  Place a portion of filling on one half
of the semi-circle. Dampen the edges with some water & seal. Set each
samosa aside until ready to cook.

TO COOK:  Either, preheat the oven to 350F, place samosas on an
ungreased cookie sheet & bake for 20 minutes. Or, deep-fry for 7
minutes or until browned. Drain on paper towels & serve immediately
with good chutnies. Or let go cold & freeze.  Reheat in a 350F oven.

NOTE:  Baked samosas have a harder & more crunchy pastry. Deep-fried
& I find that they retain too much fat. Try whichever way you find
you prefer.
