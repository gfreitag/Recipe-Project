SUPER SALAD SEASONING MIX makes: Sprinkled topping over tossed green
salads, baked potatoes, and buttered French bread or rolls, before
toasting. Garnish for potato salads, macaroni or egg salads. (I
personally add to my mashed potatoes also.) Sour cream dip made with
2 tablespoons mix and 1 cup sour cream. This recipe comes from
"MAKE-A-MIX COOKERY". (I keep some in a shaker on the table. As shown
in the picture in the book.  That way everyone can find their own
uses for this all-purpose seasoning.)
