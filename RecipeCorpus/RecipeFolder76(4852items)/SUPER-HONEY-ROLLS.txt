Title: SUPER HONEY ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Rolls
2 pk Yeast
1 c  Water; warm (105-115F)
3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour (to 4cups)
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter (or marg.); melted
1    Egg; beaten
3 tb Honey
2 tb Butter (or marg.); melted
Dissolve yeast in water in a large mixing bowl. Combine 2-1/2 cups
flour and salt; add to yeast mixture, stirring well. Add 1/2 cup
butter, egg, and honey; stir well.  Add enough flour to form a stiff
dough. Place in a well-greased bowl, turning once to grease top.
Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts,
until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour).

Punch dough down; turn dough out on a lightly floured surface, and
turn to coat with flour.  Shape into 3/4 inch balls; place 3 balls in
each cup of well-greased muffin pans. Cover and let rise in a warm
place 20 to 25 minutes.  Brush tops of rolls with 2 tablespoons
butter. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden
brown.

Note: Tender and moist right from the oven, these rolls will retain
their freshness in an airtight container in the refrigerator for
several days.
