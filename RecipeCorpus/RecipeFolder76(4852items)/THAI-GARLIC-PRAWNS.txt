Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
8    Cloves Garlic, Crushed
2 tb Minced Corriander Root
2 tb Fish Sauce
1 1/2 tb Brown Sugar
1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/4 lb Cleaned Prawns
Oil For Frying
Spanish garlic prawns are yesterday's fashion, but are still so
enjoyable that most of us are prepared to eat them and to hell with
friends and colleagues next day. Perhaps the vast quantity of
coriander root in this Thai version has magical properties because
the after-math doesn't seem to be severe.

Prepare a marinade by mixing together 8 crushed cloves of garlic, 2
tablespoons washed and minced coriander root, 2 table- spoons fish
sauce, 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add 500 g
of shelled and cleaned prawns and leave to marinate for 15-30 minutes.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan, add the prawns and their
marinade and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes or just until the prawns are
pink. Stir in the juice of a lemon and serve immediately with rice
and sliced tomatoes and cucumber.
