Omar the Pieman has been vending pies since 1964 after he left
sailing the high seas as a merchant marine. He and his wife,
Haneefah, decided to provide for their family in a traditional way by
baking delicious homemade pies and cakes.

In August of 1964 Omar left on his first route through the historic
streets of New Orleans' French Quarter. As he went along shouting,
"Pieman, pieman ... delicious, fresh-baked pies," his outgoing and
friendly character, as well as his pies, became known and enjoyed by
French Quarter residents.

In his 20 years of business, Omar the Pieman, has been vending in the
French Quarter, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the
Bastille Celebration and now finally from his own little "home, sweet
home" kitchen in The Marketplace. Throughout the week from 9:30 to
5:30 his son, Omar Ibn, delivers trays of velvety smooth pies baked
daily by his mother, Haneefah (the lady behind the scenes). She was
once quoted, "I won't let one pie out of my sight unless the crust
melts in my mouth and the fillings are at their best."

Taken from the sadly out-of-print New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival
Cookbook, copyright 1984. Mix the potatoes with rotary beater until
they are smooth. Then add the other ingredients to the potatoes and
beat for 5 minutes. Pour filling into unbaked 9" pie shell, bake for
40-45 minutes at 350-325. Can also be served with a favorite topping:
hot rum sauce, ice cream or whipped cream. Walt MM Omar At The Market
