Title: TANGY MUSHROOM MISO GRAVY
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Mushrooms
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
3 c  Water
1/4 c  Brown rice miso
1 tb Tamari
1/2 c  Nutritional yeast
1 ts Celery seed
Fresh ground black pepper
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water
Wash and slice the mushrooms.  Saute mushrooms with the balsamic
vinegar in a large skillet until fully cooked. Remove mushrooms from
skillet and set aside. Keep the mushroom liquid in the skillet.

Add 3 cups water, miso, tamari, and nutritional yeast to the skillet.
Whisk until thoroughly blended and simmer for a few minutes. Add
celery seed and black pepper to taste. Add mushrooms.

Mix together cornstarch and 1/4 cup water in a cup. Make sure the
cornstarch is fully dissolved.  With skillet over medium heat, add the
cornstarch suspension to the gravy a little at a time. Stir
continually. When gravy reaches desired thickness, cook for a minute
longer and then serve immediately.

Note:  If you want to make this ahead, make up the miso-mushroom
mixture as described but do not add cornstarch. When you are ready to
serve it, heat up the miso-mushroom mixture and thicken before
serving.

Makes 4 cups.
