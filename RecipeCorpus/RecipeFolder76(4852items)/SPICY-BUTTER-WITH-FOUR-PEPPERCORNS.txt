Title: SPICY BUTTER WITH FOUR PEPPERCORNS
Categories: Spreads, Seasonings
Yield: 1 Batch
1/2 c  Unsalted butter; softened
1 ts Pink peppercorns
1 ts Green peppercorns
1 ts White peppercorns
1 ts Black peppercorns
1    Garlic clove
2    To 3 tb. fresh parsley
-- minced
Soften butter in a small mixing bowl.  Grind peppercorns in a mortar
and pestle to a medium coarseness; they should not be finely ground,
but they shouldn't be too coarse either.  Add them to the butter.

Mince the garlic or squeeze it through a garlic press and add to the
butter along with the parsley.  Blend all of the ingredients with a
fork. Place the butter in a crock or small ramekin, cover with waxed
paper or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour before
using.

Yield: Generous 1/2 cup.

Belsinger and Dille write: "The range of pepper flavors means that
just a little of this butter adds a lot of taste. It is simple and
easy to prepare, and goes with practically any dish, vegetable or
meat, cooked in almost any style, whether steamed, boiled, sauteed,
baked, or grilled. We like it especially with fish, poultry,
potatoes, cauliflower, carrots, beets, squash, and corn. Wrapped
tightly, it will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week, in the
freezer for a month. If you prefer not to use pink peppercorns, make
a spicy butter with three peppercorns; replacing the teaspoon of pink
peppercorns with equal amounts of green, white and black."
