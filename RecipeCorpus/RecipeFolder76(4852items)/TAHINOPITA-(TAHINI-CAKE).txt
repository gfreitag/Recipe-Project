This cake is frequently made during Lent as it contains no animal
products. Peanut butter, the smooth, creamy variety, may be used
instead of tahini.

Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 45-60 minutes

Grease a 20 cm (8 inch) tube pan or a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inch) slab
cake pan with melted margarine or oil. Chill in refrigerator until
required. Beat tahini, sugar and orange rind for 10 minutes, then
gradually beat in orange juice.  Sift dry ingredients twice and fold
into tahini mixture. Blend in walnuts and sultanas.

Dust chilled cake pan with flour and turn batter into pan. Spread
evenly and knock base of pan on table top to settle batter. Bake in a
moderate oven for 55-60 minutes for tube pan, 45 minutes or so for
slab cake. When cooked, invert cake in its pan onto cake rack and
leave for 2-3 minutes before lifting pan from cake. Cool cake and cut
in slices or squares to serve. Store cake in a sealed container.
