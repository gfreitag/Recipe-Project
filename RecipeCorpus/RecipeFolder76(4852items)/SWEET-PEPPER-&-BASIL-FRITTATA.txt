First, reduce balsamic vinegar by half in a saucepan over high heat.
Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet; add
onion, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a few pinches of pepper. Saute onion
over medium heat until it begins to release its juices, about 4-5
minutes. Add peppers, garlic and bay leaf; cover and cook very slowly
over low heat for about 15 minutes. Set vegetables aside. Remove bay
leaf. Preheat oven to 325'F. Beat eggs in a bowl and add onion-pepper
mixture, cheeses and basil. Season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt
and a few more pinches of pepper. In a 9" saute pan with an ovenproof
handle, heat remaining tablespoon of olive oil to just below smoking
point. Swirl oil around sides of pan to coat it. Turn heat down to
low, then immediately pour frittata mixture into pan. Cook frittata
over low heat for 1-2 minutes, until sides begin to set; transfer to
a 325'F. oven and bake, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, until frittata
is golden and firm. Loosen frittata with a spatula. Place a plate
over pan, flip over, and turn frittata out. Brush bottom and sides
with reduced balsamic vinegar and cut into wedges.
