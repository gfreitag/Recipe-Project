Title: STRAWBERRY BAVARIAN
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
-Karen Thackeray
2 c  Strawberries; sliced/hulled
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Env unflavored gelatin; 1 tb
3/4 c  Cold water
2    Egg whites
1 c  Whipping cream
Place berries and sugar in a bowl. Partially crush berries with a
fork or potato masher (there should be some berry chunks); set aside.
In a 1-qt pan, stir together gelatin and water; let stand for 5 min
or until gelatin has softened. Stir in strawberry mixture. Bring just
to a boil, stirring constantly. Pour into a large bowl and let cool
thoroughly until mixture is thick but not set. In another bowl, beat
egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold beaten egg whites into
strawberry mixture. In the same bowl you just beat whites, whip
cream; fold into strawberry mixture. Pour into 6 dessert glasses.
Cover and refrigerate for at LEAST 4 hours or, better yet, until the
next day. Enjoy!!! Source: Sunset Easy Basics for Good Cooking
