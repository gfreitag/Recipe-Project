Categories: Pasta, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
3    Spring onions; sliced
1    2.5cm. piece fresh ginger
- grated
3 tb Dark sesame oil
75 g  Baby sweetcorn; sliced
50 g  Water-chestnuts, sliced
75 g  Button mushrooms

50 g  Mange-tout

2 tb Soy sauce
175 g  Tagliatelle
-- cooked 'al dente'
This is a kind of western chow mein, quickly and easily prepared. A
delicious way to eat tagliatelle, the soft pasta contrasting with the
crunchiness of the Chinese vegetables.

Stir-fry the spring onions and ginger gently in the oil for a couple
of minutes so that they soften, then toss in the prepared vegetables
and stir until they heat through and begin to soften - about 4-5
minutes. Then stir in the soy sauce and heat through again, stirring
all the time. Pour this mixture over the hot, drained tagliatelle in
a warm serving-dish, toss thoroughly and serve immediately.
