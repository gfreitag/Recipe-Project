Title: TERRIYAKI CHICKEN WINGS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Honey
1    Cl Garlic; minced
1/2 ts Ginger
Recipe by: "Lynne M. Underhill" <underhil@IBL.BM> Mix all ingredients
together.  Put some of the sauce aside for use when cooking. Put the
remaining sauce and about 1 1/2 pounds chicken wings in a resealable
bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight  Then pop them on
preheated barbecue or under the broiler basting with reserved sauce.
Turn often. They tend to get quite burnt on the outside (I like them
that way though) but you may want to pre-cook the wings in the
microwave for a few minutes before putting them on the grill. Make
sure you cook them thoroughly!!! Don't want to make anyone sick!
