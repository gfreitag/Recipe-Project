Title: THE BEST BUTTERMILK WAFFLES
Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Easy, Quick, Quick & eas
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Cornmeal, optional
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1 lg Egg, separated
7/8 c  Buttermilk
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
Whisk yolk with buttermilk and butter. Beat egg white until it just
holds a 2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a
thin steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be
careful not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward
end of mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients;
gently fold egg white into batter. Spread appropriate amount of
batter onto waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook
waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You
can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5
minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. (I rarely have buttermilk in the
house, but I always have buttermilk *powder*. I substitute 1/4 cup
buttermilk powder + 7/8 cup water for the buttermilk in this recipe.
I add the buttermilk powder to the dry ingredients, and I add the
water to the wet ingredients. The flavor is great! I do NOT use the
cornmeal. Sometimes I add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
extract, but the sugar makes the waffles brown more quickly. I
usually double or triple the recipe. If you don't have buttermilk or
buttermilk powder, use the recipe for "Almost-as-Good-as-Buttermilk
Waffles" instead. -jlw) NOTES
: "The secret to great waffles is a thick batter, so don't expect to
pour this one. Make toaster waffles out of leftover batter --
undercook the waffles a bit, cool them on a wire rack, wrap them in
plastic wrap and freeze. Pop them in the toaster for a quick
breakfast." -- Christopher Kimball, Cook's Illustrated magazine. By
