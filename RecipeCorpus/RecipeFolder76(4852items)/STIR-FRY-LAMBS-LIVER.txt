Title: STIR-FRY LAMBS LIVER
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
12 oz Lamb's Liver
8 oz Courgettes
6 oz Carrots, Peeled
1 bn Spring Onions
1 tb Oil
1 tb Butter
1 tb Soy Sauce
1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
Cut the liver, courgettes and peeled carrots into half-inch strips.
Trim spring onions and cut into pieces about 3 inches long. Heat oil
in a solid, shallow pan, put in the carrots and cook over a medium
heat for 3 minutes. Add courgettes and spring onions and turn in oil
for another 2 minutes. Turn heat up high, put in the butter and when
it stops fizzling, add liver. Turn heat down a bit and cook liver for
1 minute, stirring gently. The liver should still be just pink. Cook
for two long and you'll have stir-fried shoe leather. Mix soy and
worcestershire sauces and pour over liver and vegetables. Stir
thoroughly and serve at once on rice or good, crusty bread.
