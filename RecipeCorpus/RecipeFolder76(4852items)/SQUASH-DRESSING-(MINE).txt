Title: SQUASH DRESSING (MINE)
Categories: My favorite, Holiday, Southern, Pot luck, Cassarole
Yield: 1 Servings
Yellow Squash
Corn bread
2 cn Cream of Chicken soup
2 tb Butter/oleo
1 lg Onion, chopped
1 lg Bell pepper, chopped
1/2 c  Celery, chopped
4    Eggs (see directions)
1 lb Velveeta (mexican)
-(see directions)
Salt & pepper, to taste
I am sorry about the amounts...I haven't measured the ingredients, but
after the first time you will have a better idea of how much to use.

Make a 9" skillit of cornbread. let cool.  Take about 4-8 yellow
squash (depending on size, about 2-3 lbs) and boil until soft. While
the squash is cooking, put the cornbread in a bowl and cut with a
butter knife (dull bladed dinner knife) until crumbly.  I know there
are other ways to crumble it, but there really is a difference. Melt
butter in skillit, saute veggies until soft, let cool.  Mix soup with
eggs (I use between 3 and 6 eggs depending on how it looks). Add
cooled veggies, stir well. Stir into cornbread. Add squash and
"enough" of the water. Should be the consistancy of oatmeal. (lumpy &
soupy at the same time) Stir in salt & pepper. Cut cheese into 1"
cubes and stir in. People use between 1/2lb and 1 lb depending on how
well they like cheese. I use the mild mexican, but others will prefer
the hot.  Pour/slide into baking dish allowing at least 1-2" growing
room. Bake at 350f until done, lightly brown, and not runny (from the
eggs).  Allow to settle for 10-15 minutes.

Note: I *hate* squash and I *hate* cornbread stuffing...but this is
one of my favorite dishes.
