Title: STRAWBERRY RHUBARB LEATHER
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Rhubarb
1/4 c  Water
2 c  Strawberries sliced
1/2 c  Sugar
Combine finely chopped rhubarb and water. Simmer over medium heat for
about 5 minutes. Add strawberries and sugar. Simmer another 5
minutes. Puree mixture until smooth in a blender or food processor.
Dehydrate in a dehydrator or in oven.*

To dry in an oven just set temp at lowest possible setting --about 140
degress would be good.  Dry until fruit feels leather like ;yet
pliable. This would probably best be done on parchment paper, Remove
the leather while it is still warm and roll it up.
