Title: SUGAR FREE FLUFFY FROSTING
Categories: Cakes, Diabetic, Low-cal, Low-fat
Yield: 16 Servings
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Water
2 pk Sweet N Low
2    Lg eggs
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Vanilla
Combine sugar, water, Sweet N Low, egg whites, and cream of tartar in
top of a double boiler and beat at high speed for 1 minute. Set over
simmering water in the bottom of the double boiler. Continue to beat
at high speed for 4-5 minutes or until soft peaks form.
Remove from heat. Add vanilla to frosting and continue beating at
high speed 1-2 minutes or until thick enough to spread on a cooled
cake. Use about 2 1/2 tablespoons per portion if frosting
individually; or use this amount to frost a 2-layer cake or a 9 inch
square cake, both of which would then be cut into 16 equal servings.
You can change the frosting easily by adding a couple drops of food
coloring and some flavoring, such as 2 drops of red coloring and some
peppermint flavoring. 1 serving = 1 vegetable (1-1 1/2 tablespoons
may be used as a topping for cake or pudding without counting it as
an exchange. calories =
