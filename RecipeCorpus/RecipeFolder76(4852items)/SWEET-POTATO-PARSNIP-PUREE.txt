Title: SWEET POTATO-PARSNIP PUREE
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Good sized sweet potatoes
Equal bulk in parsnips
1 ts Cumin
Peel sweet potatoes and parsnips, cut into chunks, and cook in water
until soft.  A pressure cooker speeds this up. Drain, puree in food
processor. Mix the puree and cumin and put in a casserole dish. Allow
to sit for 15 minutes for cumin flavor to develop, mix again, serve.

I subbed the cumin for a T of sesame tahini, which can also be subbed
for with a few drops of sesame oil if you can afford it. I believe
the cff would stay below 10%.

Oh, and the water from cooking makes a good start on soup the next
day.
