Title: SWEET & HOT CORNED BEEF
Categories: Corned beef
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Fresh lean corned beef
1 lg Onion, peeled
4    Whole cloves
6    Black peppercorns
6    Garlic cloves
2 sm Dried chilies
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper

1/2 c  Bitter orange marmalade
When you buy corned beef, ask for the "first cut," which is the
leanest part. If you prefer your meat more piquant, add a few chilies
to the pot. Let the corned beef rest about 15 minutes after baking,
for smoother, easier slicing.

1. Place corned beef in a large, heavy pot; cover with water.

2. Stud the onion with cloves. Add to pot along with the peppercorns,
garlic and chilies.

3. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low,
partially covered and simmer for 2 1/2 hours or until meat is tender.
Preheat oven to 350'F.

4. Remove beef to a small, shallow baking dish. Set aside 3/4 cup
cooking liquid. Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper, then spread
marmalade over top. Pour reserved cooking liquid into pan. Bake 25
minutes, basting occasionally.
