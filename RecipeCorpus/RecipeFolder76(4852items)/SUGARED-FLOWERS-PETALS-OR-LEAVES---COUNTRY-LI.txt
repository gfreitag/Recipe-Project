Categories: Holidays, Desserts, Decor
Yield: 6 Dozen
6    To 7 dozen pesticide-free
-edible small flowers,
-petals, or mint leaves
-(see Note)
3/4 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Meringue powder mixed
-with 3 to 4 T water (or if
-not to be eaten, 3 large
-egg whites)
1. Rinse flowers, petals, or leaves in cool water and gently pat dry
on facial tissues.

2. In separate small bowls, place sugar and meringue-powder mixture
(or egg whites if the decorations will not be eaten). Holding 1
flower, petal, or leaf at a time, with a tiny paintbrush, paint all
sides with meringue-powder mixture.

3. Holding the flower, petal, or leaf over the bowl of sugar,
sprinkle all sides with sugar until well coated. Place sugared
flower, petal, or leaf directly on wire rack over waxed paper and let
stand in warm place until sugar dries and hardens. Repeat to coat all
pieces. Rinse and dry fingers frequently to remove stickiness.

4. Store sugared flowers, petals, or leaves in an airtight container
with waxed paper between the layers until ready to use.

Note: Purchase edible flowers from a gourmet produce market or organic
gardener. Flowers from a florist will not be pesticide-free. You may
use pansies, violets, violas, chrysanthemums, nasturtiums, primroses,
or roses. Already sugared edible flowers can be found in gourmet
shops; sugared pansies can be ordered by mail from Grapevine Trading
Co., 59 Maxwell Ct., Santa Rosa, CA 95401; (707) 576-3950.

Note: Meringue powder is used as a coating here and can be purchased
wherever cake-decorating supplies are, sold or by mail from Wilton
Industries, Inc., 2240 West 75th St., Woodridge, IL 60517 (708)
963-7100. If the sugared flowers are not to be eaten and are for
display only, use egg whites instead.
