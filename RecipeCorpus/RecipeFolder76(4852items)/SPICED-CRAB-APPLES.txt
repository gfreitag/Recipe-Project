Procedure: Remove blossom petals and wash apples, but leave stems

or toothpick. Mix vinegar, water, and sugar and bring to a boil. Add
spices tied in a spice bag or cheesecloth. Using a blancher basket or
sieve, immerse 1/3 of the apples at a time in the boiling
vinegar/syrup solution for 2 minutes. Place cooked apples and spice
bag in a clean 1- or 2-gallon crock and add hot syrup. Cover and let
stand overnight. Remove spice bag, drain syrup into a large saucepan,
and reheat to boiling. Fill pint jars with apples and hot syrup,
leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the
