Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pk 10 oz. fresh spinach

Trim the spinach of coarse stems and blemished leaves, and wash. Pat
the spinach dry with paper toweling, tear into bite-size pieces, and
put into a large serving bowl along with the mushrooms and onion.
Set aside.  Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a 12 inch skillet over
moderately high heat until crisp -- about 5 minutes. Drain on paper
toweling and reserve.  Pour off all but 5 tablespoons of the
drippings. Reduce the heat to low.   Add the mustard, sugar, vinegar,
Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice to the drippings. Stir to mix
well. Pour the dressing over the salad, crumble the bacon over it,
and toss thoroughly. Serve immediately.
