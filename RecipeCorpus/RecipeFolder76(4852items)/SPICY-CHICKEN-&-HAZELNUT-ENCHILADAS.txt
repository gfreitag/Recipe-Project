If using fresh tomatillos, prepare by washing and removing husks.
Place in saucepan, cover with water and simmer until tender, about 5
to 7 minutes; drain. If using tomatillos, drain and discard liquid.
For sauce, mince garlic, jalapenos, cilantro and onions in food
processor or blender. Add drained tomatillos, sour cream, yogurt,
honey and salt; puree. Mix in green chilies and set aside. Soften
tortillas either by frying on both sides in a small amount of
vegetable oil, by wrapping in foil and placing in hot oven until hot,
or by placing in microwave oven until heated. In the center of each
tortilla, place about 2 tablespoons each of chicken, sauce and
cheese. Add about 2 teaspoons chopped hazelnuts. Pour 1/4 of the
sauce in the bottom of a greased 9x12-inch baking dish. Place filled
enchiladas in dish and pour remaining sauce over top. Sprinkle with
remaining cheese and then with hazelnuts. Bake in a 350 oven until
heated through, about 20 minutes.
