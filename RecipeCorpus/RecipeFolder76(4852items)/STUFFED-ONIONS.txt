Title: STUFFED ONIONS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
4 ea Large white onions
1 x  Bread crumbs
4 oz Grated swiss cheese
1 x  Light cream
1 x  Fresh parsley
1 c  Cooked rice
Hollow out onions (a melon-baller works well -- leave at least 2-3
"layers of rings" so onions can support filling) then blanch the
"shells" until they are softened, about 9-10 minutes.
Saute the onion pieces removed (from about 2 onions) in a little
butter. Mix this with enough breadcrumbs to "glue or bond" the
mixture together and then add enough cream to "wet" or keep the
mixture moist.
Add cooked rice, and salt & pepper to taste.
Stuff onion-rice mixture back into onion shells, Garnish with more
grated swiss and thyme.  Bake under moderate heat just to reheat and
melt cheese topping.
