Courgettes lend themselves to stuffing in many imaginative ways. This
particular mixture is nutty and cheesy, a delicate and appetizing
filling for blanched courgettes. A lovely summer dish that can be
served hot or warm.

Blanch the courgettes in boiling water for 5 minutes, then cut them
lengthwise and cool a little. Scoop out the inner flesh carefully
with a grapefruit knife and chop it very finely.

Cook the onions gently in the oil until they are soft and sweet,
about 10 minutes. Stir in the courgette flesh and cook for another 5
minutes. Add the ground almonds, breadcrumbs and cheese and stir
until well mixed together. Mix in the beaten egg so that the mixture
is soft but firm.

Fill the courgette halves with the stuffing and sprinkle with
Parmesan. Garnish with the browned flaked almonds and bake at 200
degrees C / 400 degrees F / gas 6 for 15 minutes.
