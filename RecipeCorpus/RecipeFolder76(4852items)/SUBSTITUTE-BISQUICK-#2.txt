Title: SUBSTITUTE BISQUICK #2
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
5 c  Flour
1/4 c  Baking powder
1/2 tb Salt
1 c  Shortening
Sift dry ingredients together in large bowl.  With two knives, a
pastry blender, or your food processor, cut shortening in in
spoonsful until mixture is texture of course cornmeal. If you are
using a food processor, start and stop often during processing and
watch it closely.

Keep mix stored in labeled, tightly closed container. It will keep on
a pantry shelf 1-6 months in dry weather. In very hot, humid weather,
it's a good idea to keep mix in refrigerator.

Sylvia's comments:  I mixed this up in my Osterizer stand mixer
instead of hand-cutting or using a food processor. I did have to
manually turn it against the way it wanted to go a few times, but
that was it. I used a very low speed.  I have used this substitute in
a biscuit recipe, and it worked fine.
