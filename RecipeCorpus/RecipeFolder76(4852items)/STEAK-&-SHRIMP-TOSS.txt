Categories: Beef, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings

2 lg Onions
8 oz Fresh Mushrooms
2    Sweet, Red or Green Peppers
1 lb Zucchini
2 tb Oil
2 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1 tb Cornstarch

This is a delicious and versitile recipe. If chicken is used instead
of beef, substitute chicken broth instead of beef broth. For
vegetarians, use eggplant slices instead of meat, and use vegetable
broth.

Trim fat and cut meat across the grain into strips about 1/4"
thick, 1" wide, and 3" long. Peel and slice onions; wipe mushrooms
clean with damp paper towel and slice lengthwise. Seed peppers and
cut into strips; trim the zucchini and cut into 3" sticks. Heat oil
in wok or large skillet [MW: browning dish]; stir toss meat strips to
brown on both sides (1 or 2 minutes). Push to side of pan; add onions
and mushrooms; stir each to glaze. Add pepper strips, zucchini; cook
about 3 minutes, tossing occasionally. Add worcestershire sauce which
has been stirred with cornstarch; then add catsup, crushed red pepper
(if desired) and beef broth. Bring to a boil; add shrimp. Cover and
cook until shrimp are pink and hot through (1 to 4 minutes). Stir
lightly and serve. Makes 4 servings.
