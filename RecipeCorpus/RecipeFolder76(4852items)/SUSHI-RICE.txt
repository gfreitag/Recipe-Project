Title: SUSHI RICE
Categories: Oriental, Vegetables, Rice
Yield: 12 Servings
4 c  Rice;Short Grain
4    Water;cups
4 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Vinegar;Rice or mild white
6 tb Sugar
4 ts Salt
4 ts Mirin or Dry Sherry
Put 4 cups short-grain rice into a large, heavy pan. Add 4 cups cold
water and 4 teaspoons sugar; soak about 2 hours. Cover and bring to a
boil on high heat until the water begins to spew out from the lid.
Without lifting the lid, turn heat immediately to low (on an electric
range, have one of the units preheated to low and immediately
transfer the pan of rice). Cook for 12 minutes on low heat; remove
from heat and let stand 10 minutes, all without lifting the lid.
Meanwhile, combine in a small pan 1/2 cup white vinegar, 6
tablespoons sugar, and 4 teaspoons salt; heat just until sugar is
dissolved. Also have ready an electric hair dryer or have someone
standing by who can fan the rice mixture to cool it quickly as you
add the vinegar mixture (this prevents the rice from becoming soggy).
Turn the cooked rice immediately into a large bowl and carefully fold
in the vinegar mixture while fanning or cooling it with the hair
dryer set on "cool", being careful to keep the rice grains whole.

If you use a rice cooker, use a cup measure, and not the small one
that comes with the cooker and let the rice & water stand for two
hours before covering and turning the cooker on.
