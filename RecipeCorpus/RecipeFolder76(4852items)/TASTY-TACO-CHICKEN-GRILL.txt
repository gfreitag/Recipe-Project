Place chicken on prepared grill, skin side up, about 8" from heat.
Grill, turning a few times, for about 20 minutes or until fork can be
inserted with ease. Brush generously with reserved sauce during 20
minutes of grilling. When chicken is done, place on platter; top with
remaining sauce and sprinkle with cheese, if you like.
Sauce: In small saucepan, make sauce by mixing together onion, tomato
sauce, taco sauce, molasses, vinegar, oil, salt, oregano, and pepper.
Bring mixture to a boil. Remove from heat and cool 2 minutes.
