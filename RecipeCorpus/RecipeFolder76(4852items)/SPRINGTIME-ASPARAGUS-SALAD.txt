* I always peel asparagus, as the stalk can be quite tough,
especially on mature asparagus.  If you purchase the pencil thin
asparagus, it is not necessary to peel them, as they are generally
quite tender.

HOW TO TOAST NUTS

Spread nuts out on a cookie sheet and bake in a 350F degree oven for
5 to 10 minutes until golden. Different sizes and types of nuts toast
at varying times; the smaller the nut, the faster it browns, so you
have to keep a watchful eye on the oven.
