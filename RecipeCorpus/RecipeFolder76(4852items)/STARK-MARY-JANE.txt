Title: STARK MARY JANE
Categories: Candies, Miscell, Spice
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
3 tb Molasses
1    Egg white
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1/4 c  Powdered sugar
Cornstarch for dusting
1.  Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan over medium
heat. 2. Heat stirring, until the sugar begins to boil, then continue
to cook, using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. 3.
When the sugar reaches 240F degrees, or the soft-ball stage, beat the
egg white in a microwave-safe bowl until it is tiff and forms peaks.
Divide the beaten egg white, and throw out half. (You only need 1/2
egg white for this recipe, and it is easier to divide when beaten.)
4. When the sugar reaches 265F degrees, or the hard-ball stage, stir
in the molasses, then pour the mixture in thin streams into the egg
white while beating with an electric mixer on low speed. 5. Beat for
3 to 4 minutes and then pour half the mixture into a 9x9-inch greased
pan and let it firm up in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. 6.
Combine the peanut butter and powdered sugar. 7. When the candy is
firm, spread a thin layer of the peanut butter mixture on top. 8.
Microwave the remaining candy mixture for 1 minute on high, or until
it becomes soft again. 9. Pour the softened candy over the peanut
butter layer. 10. When the candy is cool but still pliable, (about 20
minutes later)  turn it out onto a surface dusted lightly with
cornstarch. Use a  cornstarch-dusted rolling pin to roll the candy
about 1/4-inch thick. 11. Use kitchen scissors or a sharp knife to
cut the candy into 1 1/2 x 1/2-inch rectangles. Makes 30 candies.
