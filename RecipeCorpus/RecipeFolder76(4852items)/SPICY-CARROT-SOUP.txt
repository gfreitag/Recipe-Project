Title: SPICY CARROT SOUP
Categories: Soups, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
350 g  Carrots, cooked
600 ml Vegetable stock
2 ts Garam masala
Salt; to taste
For all its simplicity - and economy! - this is an exceptional soup.
It takes hardly any time to prepare, yet the results are sensational.
Lovely with hot granary bread straight from the oven.

Liquidize the carrots with the stock and the garam masala. Heat
gently, stirring, for 5 minutes, then season to taste with salt.
Simmer for a further 5 minutes before serving.
