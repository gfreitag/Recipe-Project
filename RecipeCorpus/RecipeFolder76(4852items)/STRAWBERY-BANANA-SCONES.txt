Title: STRAWBERY BANANA SCONES
Categories:
Yield: 6 Servings
2 md Bananas -- mashed
1 c  Strawberries -- peeled and
Chopped
2 tb Sugar
3 c  Flour, all-purpose
3 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
3 tb Butter -- softened
2 ea Egg -- beaten slightly
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Mix together the bananas, strawberries and sugar, set aside. (Don't
do this much in advance, the bananas will blacken)

Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Mix well with a
whisk. Using a pastry blender, mix in the butter until coarse. Still
using the pastry blender, mix in the eggs, one at a time.

Stir in the banana mixture.  The dough will be very moist and messy.
Knead it in the bowl enough to pick up all of the flour mixture. (It
will still be very moist.)

Turn out the dough on a floured board, and flour the top of the dough
so that flour coats the entire dough. Flatten with a rolling pin or
your hands to 3/4".

Using a knife, cut the dough into squares, or large wedges, and lay
onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake in the center of the oven for
15 - 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.

I have added pine nuts, raspberries, pecans, anything to the basic
flour, baking powder, salt, butter and eggs mixture. Yum!
