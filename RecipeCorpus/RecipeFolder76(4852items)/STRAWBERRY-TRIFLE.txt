Title: STRAWBERRY TRIFLE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
INGREDIENTS:
10 oz Angel loaf cake
1/3 c  Strawberry jam or jelly
1/3 c  Cream sherry OR orange juice
3 c  Strawberries
Custard sauce (cf. below)
3/4 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Powdered sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Sliced almonds, toasted
-(optional)
3    Egg yolks
CUSTARD SAUCE:

Mix 1-1/2 tbsp. corstarch with 1/2 cup milk.  Heat 1-3/4 cups of milk
with 1/4 cup of sugar in a heavy saucepan or double boiler, just to
the point of boiling.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the cornstarch
mixture until it's smooth.  The cornstarch mixes better and without
lumps if the milk is bone-chilling COLD.

Cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will thicken *fast*,
so pay attention.  Simmer for three minutes and remove from the heat.
Beat in 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 3 beaten egg yolks. Cover and
chill.

THE TRIFLE:

Split the angel loaf cake into 3 layers.  Spread the jam between the
layers and reassemble the layers.  Cut the cake into 2-inch cubes.
Arrange the cubes in a 2-quart serving bowl and sprinkle with the
sherry or orange juice.  Wash the strawberries and pick out 8 to 12
berries for later garnishing.  Remove the hulls from the rest of the
berries and slice. Spoon the berries over the cake.

Pour the chilled Custard Sauce over the berries. Cover the mixture and
refrigerate for an hour or more. Meanwhile, whip the cream to soft
peaks. Add the sugar and vanilla and whip until it forms *stiff*
peaks. Spread the cream over the custard.

Garnish the top with whole strawberries (the green hulls against the
red and white background is particularly pleasing to the eye).
Sprinkle the entire thing with the almonds, if you have them. Chill
and serve within a few hours.

Don't try to save this too long. It will get soggy before long and the
strawberries will get mushy.  So eat it all at once.

(TIP):   Make the Custard Sauce first. Cover and refrigerate it until
it's ready for use.
