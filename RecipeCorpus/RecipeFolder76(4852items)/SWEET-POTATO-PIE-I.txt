Title: SWEET POTATO PIE I
Categories: Creole, Pies, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Cooked mashed yams
4 tb Butter
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Nutmeg
3    Eggs
3/4 c  Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Grand Marnier
1 tb Vanilla
One 9-inch unbaked pie shell
Preheat oven to 350F.
Mix together yams and butter in a bowl until well blended. Add
remaining ingredients (except the pie shell), and beat with an
electric mixer, making sure to get the rid of the yam fibers, (These
gather on the beaters, so just wash them off and continue to beat.)
Pour mixture into the pie shell and bake for about 1 hour and 15
minutes, or until done (when a toothpick inserted in center of the
pie comes out clean).
