Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, mix the butter into the
brown sugar roughly.  Stir in the rhubarb. Distrubute this mixture
evenly into 12 muffin cups.

Cream the softened butter and the sugar together, then beat in the
egg. Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg
together thoroughly, then add the butter-sugar mixture alternately
with the milk. Do not overmix.  Stir in the orange rind. Pour equal
amounts of the batter into the muffin cups.  Bake in a preheated 350
F oven for 25 minutes. Let cool in the pans 5 minutes, then invert
the muffin tins and ease the muffins out so that the sticky glaze
remains intact. Serve warm, with glaze topside.
