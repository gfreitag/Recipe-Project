3 pt chicken stock
6 oz tomato paste

Saute the following in 'enough' vegetable oil adding the ingredients
in the order specified: 2
cloves garlic 1/2 hot chilli pepper
onions (chopped) 2+
(don't go overboard!) 3-4 lbs  carrots, turnips, parsnips in chunks
(proportion according to taste) 1-2 lbs mushrooms (quartered) Once
the veg are done, add enough of the following stock to cover them
with a little room to spare: 3 pts    chicken/chicken flavor stock 1
small can of tomato paste Season with oregano, basil, and whatever
you feel like. The important thing with this recipe is to taste
regularly and go with your gut as to what is best. Serve the 'sauce'
over a bed of couscous. Note: ----- To this you can add anything from
meatballs to spicy sausages to ... nothing. It freezes really well,
so I make it in very large batches.
