Title: SWEET OATMEAL BREAD W/WHOLE WHEAT
Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Oatmeal (Quaker Oats)
3/4 c  Water
1 ts Water (in addition)
1 1/2 c  Bread flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat
1 ts Salt

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select Light Crust setting. This
was really good but next time I will add some powdered milk to make
it softer.
