Title: SWEDISH RICE PUDDING
Categories: Puddings, Desserts, Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Long grain rice
4 c  Milk, whole
3 lg Eggs
2/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
2 tb Butter or margarine, melted
1/4 ts Salt to taste
Cinnamon or nutmeg
Butter a 11 x 8 x 3-inch casserole or pan (the dish/pan size is
important, don't use a larger pan or your custard layer will be too
shallow); set aside.

In the top of a double boiler, combine the rice and 1 cup of the milk.
Cover and cook over simmering water until the rice is tender, about 45
minutes. Pour into prepared pan.

Preheat oven to 375-degrees.

In a mixer bowl, lightly beat the eggs until frothy. Add the sugar,
vanilla, butter, salt and remaining milk and mix well. Pour over the
rice and sprinkle cinnamon liberally over the top; DO NOT stir in.

Place dish in a pan of hot water (about 1/2 way up the sides of the
dish). Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the pudding is slightly puffy
and is firm on top.

Remove from the hot water and cool on a rack.

Serve at room temperature or chilled (mine never lasts that long, I
eat it HOT! :) From: Linda Magee
