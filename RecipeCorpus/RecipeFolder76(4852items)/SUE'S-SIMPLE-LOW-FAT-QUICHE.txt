Title: SUE'S SIMPLE LOW FAT QUICHE
Categories: Low fat, Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
Filling - tuna, pineapple,
Onions, broccoli, spinach,
Corn, etc (whatever takes
Your fancy)
L/F or F/F Cheese (optional) - approx 250 ml (1 cup)

Custard 150 ml milk (approx 1/4 pint) 2 eggs (I use 1 egg & 1 egg
white) 30 ml (1 heaped tablespoon) flour (ordinary white/ww flour;
corn flour; potato flour, etc) pinch of mixed herbs black pepper to
taste

1) Heat oven to 180 C (350 F).  Spray a quiche dish with non-stick
baking spray.

2) Place fillings in dish & sprinkle cheese over.

3) Place custard ingredients in bowl (in order they are given above)
& beat well to get rid of any lumps.

4) Pour custard mixture over fillings & bake in oven until set
(approx 35 mins)

I normally cook mine in the microwave (50 to 70 % power for approx 15
mins) until custard is set - if necessary I brown it off in the oven
for approx 5 mins.

The above quantities are enough for  a standard size quiche dish
(approx 25 cm in diameter).  I normally double the ingredients and
put into a rectangular casserole dish.
