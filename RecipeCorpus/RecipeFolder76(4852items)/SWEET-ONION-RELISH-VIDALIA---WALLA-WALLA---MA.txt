Notes and Credits To retain maximum crunch, this relish is not
heat-sterilized, so it must be kept refrigerated.

If you are looking for the sweetest onion, always select the flattest
shape. The more rounded or globular it is, the hotter it generally is.

Sometimes the tops of the onions almost seem to be slightly depressed
in the center. They will have the thickest layers and the sweetest
flavor.
