Title: SPINATSUPPE (SPINACH SOUP)
Categories: Norwegian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Spinach; fresh -=OR=-
2 pk Frozen chopped spinach
2 qt Chicken stock; fresh or
-canned
3 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg
2    Eggs; hard-cooked & sliced
Wash the fresh spinach thoroughly under cold running water to remove
any sand. Drain by shaking it vigorously by hand or in a lettuce
basket, then chop coarsely. If frozen spinach is used, thoroughly
defrost and drain it. Bring 2 quarts of chicken stock to a boil in a
3-4 quart saucepan and add the fresh or frozen chopped spinach.
Simmer uncovered about 6 to 8 minutes, then pour the entire contents
of the pan into a sieve set over a large bowl. Press down hard on the
spinach with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all it's juices.
Set the liquid aside in the bowl and chop the cooked spinach very
fine. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in the saucepan. When the foam
subsides, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the flour. With a
wire whisk, beat the hot stock into this white roux a little at a
time. Return the saucepan to the heat and, stirring it constantly,
bring it to the boil. Then add the spinach. Season soup with salt,
pepper and nutmeg. Half cover the pan and simmer soup over low heat
about 5 minutes longer. Stir occasionally. Garnish each serving of
soup with a few slices of hard-cooked egg. On festive occasions, such
as Easter, spinatsuppe is often served with a stuffed egg half
floating in each soup bowl. To make these, remove the yolks from 2 or
3 hard-cooked eggs (depending on how many people you plan to serve)
and mash them to a paste with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of softened
butter. Roll the mixture into little balls and nestle 2 or 3 into
each halved egg white.
