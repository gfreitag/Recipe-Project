Title: SPICY CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS
Categories: Kids!, Non-food, Holiday, Christmas
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Applesauce
4 oz Ground cinnamon
1 oz Ground cloves
1 oz Ground nutmeg
1 oz Ground ginger
(1 oz = 1/8 c = 2 Tbs; 4 oz = 8 Tbs = 1/2 c.)

Combine everything and blend with your hands until dough is smooth.
Add more applesauce if necessary. Divide dough into quarters.

Sprinkle counter with cinnamon and roll out portion of dough to 1/4"
thick. Cut with cookie cutters and transfer to cookie sheet. Pierce
with skewer to form hole for hanging.

Turn ornaments every 12 hours and examine until they are dry. This
takes 3 to 5 days.

When the ornaments lose their scent, dab on oil of cinnamon.

Note:  Roll out dough on aluminum foil and move the foil onto the
cookie sheet.  It will help the ornaments keep their shape.

Note:  You can alter the amounts as long as you use about 7 oz ground
spices to 1 c applesauce.
