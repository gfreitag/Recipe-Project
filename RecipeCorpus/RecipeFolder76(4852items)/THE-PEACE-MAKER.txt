Title: THE PEACE MAKER
Categories: Main dish, Seafood, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Rice
36    Oysters
1    French bread loaf
1    Butter, seasoning
Boil the rice and keep hot and dry. Cut off the top crust of the
bread. Hollow out the inside.  Fry the oysters. Butter the inside of
the loaf well and place in the oven to brown. Fill with the hot fried
oysters. The top of the loaf of bread may be buttered, toasted and
placed on the oysters to retain the heat, although the oysters stay
more crispy if served uncovered. Serve on a platter with hot boiled
rice which is seasoned, dotted with butter, and garnished with minced
parsley and paprika. Yield: 6 servings. Note: A finely minced clove
of garlic may be used to flavor the butter. From Rice, 200 Delightful
