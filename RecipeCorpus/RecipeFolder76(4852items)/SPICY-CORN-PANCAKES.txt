Title: SPICY CORN PANCAKES
Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
2 c  Corn kernels, fresh or
Frozen
2    Chipotle chili peppers,
Diced
2    Cloves garlic, minced
4    Scallions, diced
1 c  Lowfat soy milk
These delicious pancakes make a terrific dinner when served with a
bottled salsa for topping. I use chipotle chili peppers that are
canned in adobo sauce, but you can also use dried chipotles. Let the
dried peppers soak in warm water for several minutes before you dice
them.

Mix whole wheat flour with salt and baking powder. In a separate
bowl, mix corn, chipotles, garlic, scallions, and soy milk. Gently
blend wet ingredients with dry until well mixed. Spray skillet with
vegetable cooking spray and preheat until it is moderately hot. For
each pancake, use about 1/4 cup batter. Cook 3 minutes on each side
or until golden brown.
