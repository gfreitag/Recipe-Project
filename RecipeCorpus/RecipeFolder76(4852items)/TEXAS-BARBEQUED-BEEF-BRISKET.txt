Title: TEXAS BARBEQUED BEEF BRISKET
Categories: Barbeque, Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Boneless beef brisket (6 to
- 8 pounds)
2 ts Paprika
1 ts Ground black pepper, divided
1 tb Butter
1 ea Medium onion, grated
1 1/2 c  Catsup
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Hot pepper sauce
Trim external fat on beef brisket to 1/4 inch. Combine paprika and
1/2 tsp of the black pepper; rub evenly over surface of beef brisket.
Place brisket, fat side down, in 11 1/2 X 9" disposable foil pan. Add
1 cup water.  Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Place in center
of grid over very low coals (use a single layer of coals with space
in between each); cover cooker.  Cook 5 - 6 hours, turning brisket
over every 1 1/2 hours; use baster to remove fat from pan as it
accumulates. Add 1/2 cup water, if needed, to pan during cooking.
(Add just enough briquette during cooking to keep coals at a very low
temperature). Remove brisket from pan; place on grid, fat side down,
directly over very low coals. Reserve pan dripping. Cover; continue
cooking for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, skim fat from pan drippings; reserve 1 cup drippings. Melt
butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook until
tender crisp.  Add reserved pan drippings, remaining 1/2 teaspoon
black pepper, the catsup, lemon juice, worcestershire sauce and hot
pepper sauce; simmer
15    minutes.

Carve brisket into thin slices across the grain; serve with sauce.
Garnish with fresh peppers and lemon and lime slices.

Note:  For a smokier flavor, soak oak, pecan, mesquite or hickory
chips in water 30 minutes and add to very low coals.
