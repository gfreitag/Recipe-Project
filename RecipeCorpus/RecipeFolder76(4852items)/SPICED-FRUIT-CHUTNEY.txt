I found this excellent recipe for chutney the other day. It uses
cranberries for those folk that were looking for cranberry recipes
not too long ago.  I think this is better than Major Gray's
chutney... but then, whadoo I know?

Combine first 9 ingredients in heavy medium sauce pan over medium-
high heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low
and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add sugar, pears, apple, cranberries and currants and stir until sugar
dissolves.  Cook until fruits are soft and liquid thickens slightly,
stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature
(chutney will thicken more as it cools).  Cover and refrigerate.
Bring to room temperature before serving.
