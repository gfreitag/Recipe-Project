Title: SWEET & SOUR CABBAGE SOUP
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Head cabbage
2 lg Cans crushed tomatoes with
Added puree
(or some equivalent)
1 lg Onion
5    Cloves garlic
Juice of 2 lemons or about
1/4*cup balsamic or wine
Vinegar
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1    2 talbespoons of grated
Fresh ginger
Salt and pepper to taste
~ slice cabbage thinly to create cabbage strips, - half onion and
slice thinly to create half rings - crush, slice or dice garlic -
grate ginger

Put everything in a large soup pot and add water to cover plus a
little more. Bring to boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for
2-3 hours (longer the better).

Don't be afraid to add more tomato, sugar, or vinegar if you like it
more tomatoey, sweeter, or more sour. Taste a couple hours into the
cooking for adjustment. The cabbage will have imparted its flavor and
the tomatoes will have mellowed.

You can also add rice during the last 45 - 30 minutes (also add the
more water appropriate for the amount of rice you add. For example, I
added 3/4 cup brown rice and 1 1/2 cup water the last 40 minutes)

Or add a can of white or gabanzo beans. (Again these won't need
cooking, so just add at the end)

[If you're not a vegetarian, you can use b**f or ch*ck*n stock. Even
some browned ground m**t or soup bones.]
