Title: TANGY SALMON MOUSSE
Categories: Fish
Yield: 8 Servings
418 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
15 g  Gelatine
50 g  Smoked salmon
-- finely chopped
1 1/2 ts Minced fresh root ginger
150 ml Greek strained yogurt
175 g  Curd cheese or Quark
2    Egg whites
2 lg Grapefruits
1 tb Walnut oil
2 tb Grapefruit juice
Mixed colored salad leaves
Avocado for garnish
Drain the can of salmon. Heat the juice to almost boiling then
sprinkle over the gelatine. Stir gently until completely dissolved.

Mash the two types of salmon into a bowl and beat in the yogurt,
cheese and 1 teaspoon of the ginger. Stir in the dissolved gelatine
and cool until the mixture is just beginning to set. Whisk the egg
whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold these into the salmon
mixture then pour into a single 900ml / 1 1/2 pint fish mold or two
450ml / 3/4 pint moulds. Put into a refrigerator and leave until
completely set.

Peel the grapefruits and remove the pith from around each segment.
Put the segments into a bowl along with the remaining ginger, walnut
oil and grapefruit juice. Mix well and allow to stand for about 1
hour to marinade. Arrange the salad leaves and avocado on serving
plates and very carefully turn the mousse out onto them. Just before
serving, arrange the marinaded grapefruit segments onto the salad and
sprinkle the juices over.

Cook's Note: To turn out the mousses more easily, first dip the
moulds into hot water to loosen the sides then invert them onto the
serving plates. Pick up the plates and very gently shake from side to
side. The mousses should drop out.

Serves 8-10. Approx. 130 kcals per serving
