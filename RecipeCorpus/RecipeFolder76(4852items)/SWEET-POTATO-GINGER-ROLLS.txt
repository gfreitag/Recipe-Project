Title: SWEET POTATO GINGER ROLLS
Categories: Xmas, Holidays, Breads
Yield: 36 Rolls
1 tb Active dry yeast
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Dry milk; nonfat
1 tb Fresh gingerroot; grated
1 ts Orange rind; grated
1 ts Coarse salt
1/8 ts Nutmeg; grated
2 tb Butter; soft
3/4 c  Sweet potato; mashed
3 1/2 c  Flour; all-purpose
1    Egg; beaten w/ 1 tsp water
Sesame seeds
In a medium-size bowl dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.
Combine the sugar and dry milk with 1 cup of warm water and add to the
yeast along with the grated ginger, orange rind, salt, and nutmeg.
Whip the butter into the mashed potatoes and combine with yeast
mixture. Stir the flour in and then beat the mixture for 1 minute.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place over a pan of warm water
to rise until double in volume, about 45 minutes.

Tum out onto a floured work surface, punch down, and knead very
lightly a few turns. Pull off pieces of dough slightly smaller than a
Ping-Pong ball and, since they will be very sticky, just roll lightly
with floured hands to form a ball. Arrange on one or two greased
baking sheets large enough to hold the three dozen rolls side by side
without crowding. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm
place for 30 minutes. Paint with the beaten egg and sprinkle sesame
seeds on top. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for
25    minutes. Serve warm.
