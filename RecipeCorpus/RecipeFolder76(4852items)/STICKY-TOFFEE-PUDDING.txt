Title: STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
4 tb Butter, room temperature
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1    Egg, lightly beaten
3/4 c  Pitted dates
1 c  Boiling water
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Vanilla
Toffee sauce:
3 tb Butter
5 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Heavy cream
Soften the butter in a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar; cream
them until pale and light. Sift the flour and baking powder onto a
plate. Beat the egg with a little flour, into the creamed mixture.
Continue beating for a few minutes before mixing in the rest of the
flour. Flour the dates lightly and chop finely. Put into a bowl and
pour the boiling water over them. Mix in the baking soda and the
vanilla. Gradually blend this mixture into the batter, mixing in
well. Transfer to an 11-by-7-inch, lightly greased cake pan,
spreading out evenly. Bake in a 350-degree oven for 40 minutes.

To make the toffee sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan and add
the sugar and the cream. Simmer gently for 3 minutes. Cut the hot
pudding into squares and cover with the sauce. Place under a hot
broiler until it bubbles. Take care, as it burns easily. Serve at
once.
