peel briefly in boiling water, if desired. Finely chop peel, if
desired; set aside. Juice orange; set aside. In a small skillet,
simmer green onion 5 minutes over low heat in wine, vinegar and
stock. Strain well, discarding green onion; cool slightly. Place egg
yolks and wine mixture in a small enamel-lined saucepan. Place over
hot water or use a double-boiler. Water should be barely simmering at
any time. If mixture is over heated it will curdle and must be remade
from new ingredients. Add butter, one piece at a time, mixing well
and making sure each piece is fully incorporated before adding the
next. If desired use a whisk to beat butter into yolk mixture. When
all butter has been added, sauce should be fairly thick and creamy.
Add lemon juice, salt, white pepper, balnched orange peel and juice.
Fold in whipped cream before serving. Serve immediately to prevent
sauce from seperating. This sauce is delicious with delicate fish or
vegetable dishes, such as asparagus. It is also very good with
broiled meat. Makes 4 servings.
