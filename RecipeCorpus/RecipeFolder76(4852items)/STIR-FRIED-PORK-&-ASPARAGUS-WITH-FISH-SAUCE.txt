Categories: Chinese, Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 lb Boneless pork butt
12 md Asparagus spears
1/2 ts Fresh ginger root, minced
1 tb Peanut oil
1/3 c  Chicken stock
1 pn Sugar
1 ts Fish sauce (OR
2 ts Oyster sauce
Thin cornstarch paste
This is a basic stir-fried vegetable and meat dish. Adding just a
touch of fish sauce lends an interesting dimension to the taste.

Preparation: Slice pork butt (or comparable boneless pork) across the
grain into strips 2" by 1/4" by 1/8" thick. Wash and trim tough white
skin from asparagus. Cut asparagus into 2 1/2" segments. If asparagus
is thick (3/4" or more), cut on bias so it will cook quickly and be
balanced in size with pork strips.

Stir-frying:  Heat peanut oil in wok until it just begins to smoke.
Add pork strips and stir-fry about 1 minute until no longer pink. Add
asparagus and stir-fry briskly for another minute. Before asparagus
turns bright green, add ginger, chicken stock and sugar; keep stir-
ring. When liquid boils, reduce heat to medium, add fish sauce (not
oyster sauce, though), cover and simmer for about 1 minute or until
asparagus is cooked but still firm.  Uncover, turn up heat, and push
ingredients out of liquid. Dribble in cornstarch paste, stirring
continuously until liquid thickens. You may need 1 to 2 tsp of paste.
Recombine ingredients. Serve.
