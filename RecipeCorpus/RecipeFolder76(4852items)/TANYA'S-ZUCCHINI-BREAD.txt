Title: TANYA'S ZUCCHINI BREAD
Categories: Breads, Quick, Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
-M.CARMAIN1 [Melinda]
2 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Oil
1 ts Vanilla
3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
2 ts Cinnamon
1 sm Box vanilla instant pudding
1/2 c  Nuts; optional
2 c  Zucchini; grated
Mix sugar, eggs, oil and vanilla. Beat 2 minutes. Sift together flour,
baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and dry pudding mix. Mix
both mixtures together. Add nuts, if desired, and zucchini. Beat
another 3 minutes. Pour into well-greased loaf pans and bake at 350
for 50 minutes.

For Muffins, bake at 400 for 20 to 25 minutes.

Makes 24 muffins or 2 loaves.

My notes: be sure to not to drain off the juice in the bottom of the
food processor when you grate the zucchini, otherwise the batter is
too stiff. If the batter is still not moist enough, add a bit of
water.
