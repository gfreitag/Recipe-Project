Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Zucchini,
Sliced crosswise

1 c  Grated mozzarella cheese
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Steam the zucchini slices until just tender and not falling apart.
Warm a large serving platter. Assemble the zucchini in layers on the
platter in the following manner: One layer zucchini, sprinkle with a
little garlic salt and fresh ground black pepper, sprinkle with a
little Parmesan cheese and lightly cover with the mozzarella.
Continue in layers until all is used and end with cheese.  By the
time this gets to the table the mozzarella cheese will have melted
just enough. Walt MM
