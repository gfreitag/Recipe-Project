Title: SWEDISH CHOCOLATE CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
1 c  Shortening
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
2 oz Baking chocolate
-(unsweetened), melted
2 c  Cake flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 c  Cream, heavy
2 ts Vanilla extract
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Butter a Bundt pan and sprinkle with
about 2 T dry bread crumbs, until it is well-coated. This makes a
much better crust than flour does.

In a large bowl, add the sugar to the shortening and cream well.
Blend in the eggs, one at a time, and beat well. Stir in the melted
chocolate.

Sift together the dry ingredients.  Combine the cream and vanilla
extract. Add to the chocolate mixture alternately with the dry
ingredients, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Pour the
batter into the pan and bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool the cake in the
pan a few minutes before removing.

NOTES:

*  A rich chocolate Bundt cake -- I got this recipe from my mom, who
got it from an American book called Swedish Baking. I like to make
this because it does not need to be frosted, which makes it an easy
dessert. Yield: one Bundt cake.

*  This is not an authentic Swedish recipe because their flour is
different enough to cause problems in baking. However, the results
seem authentic.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  measure carefully.
