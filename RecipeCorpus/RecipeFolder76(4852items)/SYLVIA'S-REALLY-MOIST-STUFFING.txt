Title: SYLVIA'S REALLY MOIST STUFFING
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
16 c  Bread cubes
1 c  Oats, uncooked
2 ts Chili powder
2 ts Oregano leaves
2 ts Basil leaves
2 ts Thyme leaves
1 ts Parsley
1/2 ts Sage, rubbed
1    Turkey
1/4 c  Bacon drippings
1    Onions, chopped
2 c  Butter
2 c  Cornbread, crumbled
5 oz Sumflower seeds
4 c  Water
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Oregano leaves
1 ts Thyme leaves
1 ts Parsley
Use both flavored and plain breads in the stuffing.

Mix bread, oats, and seasonings in large bowl.  Remove neck and
giblets from turkey; set aside.

Melt bacon grease in skillet.  Cook onion until tender, then WITHOUT
DRAINING melt butter (NOT margarine!) in onions and added to dry
ingredients. Mix very well. Stir in crumbled cornbread and sunflower
seeds, and stuff turkey. Bake breast side down until done.

Boil neck and giblets in water with seasonings until done (about 20
minutes).  Discard neck and giblets. Add strained broth to leftover
uncooked stuffing.

When turkey is done, remove it from roasting pan and add ALL
drippings to uncooked stuffing.  Uncooked stuffing will be EXTREMELY
wet. Preheat oven to 325, spray casserole with Pam, fill with
stuffing, and bake covered for 30 minutes.
