Categories: Chinese
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/4 c  Bleached flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 oz Water
3 1/2 ts Baking powder
3 oz Milk
2 tb Lard
Mix flour, baking powder, & sugar together on a clean surface. Make a
"well" in the middle of the mixture. Gradually pour the milk into the
well while using your fingers to combine it with the dry mixture.
After the milk has been absorbed, add the H2 O and continue to work
the dough. Add lard in small pieces and continue working the dough.
Using a dough scraper in one hand, gather the dough together while
kneading with the other hand. Knead for 12 - 15 minutes until it
becomes elastic. Cover dough with a moderately damp cloth and allow
to rest for one hour. Must be used within 1 - 2 hrs. Con't be frozen.
If not all used within that time frame, use as starter for the
following Form a well in 1/2 lb. of the starter and add 1 C. flour, 2
1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/3 C. sugar and combine well. Add 1 Tbs. HOT
water and combine well. Add 2 Tbs. lard, combine well. Knead for 12 -

they claim it tastes better.
