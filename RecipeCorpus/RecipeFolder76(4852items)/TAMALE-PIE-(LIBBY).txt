Title: TAMALE PIE (LIBBY)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Water
1 c  Fine yellow corn meal
x  Dash salt
2 ts Chili powder
1 cn Black beans, rinsed and
Drained
(or about 1 1/2 c cooked
Dried black beans)
12 oz Chunky salsa
1    Diced jalapeno (or to
Taste)
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Cumin seeds, toasted and
Cracked
(or just under 1/2 tsp
Ground cumin)
1/2 ts Coriander seeds, toasted and
Cracked
(or under 1/2 tsp ground
Coriander)
2 sm Or 1 large carrot, chopped
2 oz Diced browned tempi (opt)
prepare spices and then sautee carrots in vinegar or whatever you
usually use, along with the spices.  add the jalapeno and the beans,
stirring and cooking about 3 min, then add salsa and reduce heat to a
simmer. while the bean mixture is simmering, bring 2c water to boil
with dash of salt. a little at a time, sprinkle the corn meal into
the boiling water, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.  continue
sprinkling and stirring until you have a thick porridge resembling
grits or cream of wheat (ymmv with the amount of corn meal this takes
~- don't force all the corn meal into the batter if it looks done
with less). remove batter from heat and stir in chili powder. the
bean mixture should be just about cooked now -- if carrots are
tender, remove bean mixture from heat.

spread 1/2 the corn meal mixture into the bottom of a large loaf pan
or small baking dish. spread all of the bean mixture (or as much as
reaonably fits in your pan) onto the corn batter. top with remaining
half of the batter, kind of like a top and bottom crust. bake at 400
f for 30 min or until the top corn meal batter is pretty firmly set.

garnish, if desired, with fresh tomatoes, cilantro, scallions, hot
sauce, etc.
