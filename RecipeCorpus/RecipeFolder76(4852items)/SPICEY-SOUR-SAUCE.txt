Title: SPICEY SOUR SAUCE
Categories: Ethnic, Pickles & r, Sauces, Thai, Vegetarian
1/2 c  wine vinegar
Yield: 1 Servings
12    chiles
1 ds fish sauce
2    cloves garlic -- whole

1.  Wash and dry small red chilli pepers. Remove stems, but do not
cut. Place into clear preserving or jam jar. Add garlic clove(s) 2.
Pour on vinegar until it covers the chilies about 1/2". 3. Seal jar
and store in cool dark place  (not the refidgerator) for at least one
week.

The sauce will keep for up to 2 months, with slightly smoother, richer
flavors emerging as the sauce ages.

To serve, pour off a little of the vinegar into a small soy sauce
bowl and add a very small dash of fish sauce. You may add chopped
fresh chili, shedded carrot, or diced cucumber to add colour and
flavor.
