"My chili is actually one of my boss's recipes.  He has received
requests for it from people in Maryland, Texas and many other states.
I know you'll enjoy it! - Sylvia Dorr * = This is a medium hot chili.
Reduce jalapeno peppers and hot pepper sauce for a milder chili.

Marinate the beef in beer for at least 8 hours.  Drain beef; pat dry
on paper towels.  Brown in hot oil in a large kettle. Add green
pepper, onion, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and beans; cook on medium heat
for 1 hour; add spices, jalapeno peppers and hot pepper sauce; cook 2
hours longer.
