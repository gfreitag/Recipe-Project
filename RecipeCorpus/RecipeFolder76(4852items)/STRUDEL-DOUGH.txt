*DIRECTIONS* Mix flour, butter, egg and salt. Add lukewarm water and
mix. Place on a board and knead for 10 minutes or more; or you may
toss and beat dough on the board for about 15 minutes. The more you
beat the dough the better the dough will be to work with. Place in a
greased bowl. Cover and let rest for at least one hour.

*HOW TO STRETCH STRUDEL DOUGH* Spread table with a cloth large enough
to hang over the sides. Sprinkle lightly with flour and place dough
in the center. With a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to make
an 18 inch circle. Slide hand gently below circle of dough and let
the dough rest on the back of your hands with your palms down. Now
pull the center of the dough gently toward you. Stretch and pull the
dough as you walk slowly around the table. Dough should be thin as
tissue paper. Then tear or cut off the thick outer edges, leaving
about two inches of dough hanging over the sides of the table. Now
proceed to spread on the desired filling immediately. Roll up gently
by lifting the cloth and place your strudel in a well greased baking
pan to bake.

*VARIATIONS* The only difference is that Grandma uses a large
cast-iron skillet to bake these. She says that you get a better crust
this way. Because of the skillet, once you roll up the strudel (like
a jelly roll) you must curl the strudel into a spiral shape to fit
into the skillet.
