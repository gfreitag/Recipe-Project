Title: SPINACH & FETA BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Oz
MMMMM----------------BEST BREADMACHINE COOKBK EVE---------------------
3/4 c  Spinach, frozen chopped
2 1/4 ts Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Wheat bran
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
1/2 tb Nutmeg, ground
1/2 ts Black pepper
3 tb Oil
1    Eggs
1/3 c  Feta cheese; crumbled
1/2 c  Water
Defrost spinach overnight in refrigerator or microwave, but do not
cook. Wrap in dish towel or piece of clean old sheeting and tighten
fabric around spinach to squeeze out all the liquid.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

The green spinach running through this bread makes it look like
marble. The loaf is moist yet dense and fragrant with nutmeg and
cheese. Meat loaf or cold lamb make excellent sandwich fillings, or
eat slices with chicken, egg-lemon, or beef and barley soup.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
