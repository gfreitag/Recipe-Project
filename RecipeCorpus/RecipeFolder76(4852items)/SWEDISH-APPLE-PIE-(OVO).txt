Title: SWEDISH APPLE PIE (OVO)
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Flour
1    To 1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla
4    Egg whites
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
2 ts Baking powder
2 c  Finely chopped apple
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, mix first
ingredients; the mixture will be thick.  Stir in chopped apple. Spray
a pie pan with no stick spray. Put mixture in the pan and bake for
about 35 minutes.

I never use the nuts and it still tastes great.  I never use more
than one cup on sugar - depends on the sweetness of the apples I use.
I especially like to use Fuji apples. Before baking I sprinkle the
top of the batter with a touch of cinnamon sugar.  We enjoy this warm
but it is ok cold too!
