dry enough to roll.  Roll dough on floured surface till thin and the
size of a large cookie sheet. ( Mine was so large I had to trim it).
Place on a corn meal floured cookie sheet. (I used a little oil spray
to make the corn meal stick) At last Toppings, lightly brush the
dough with tomato paste (I ended up using only 1/2 of the can).
Slice, mince, shred remaining ingredients place on pizza and slide in
the oven for 15-20 minutes.

The resulting dinner passed the significant other test...
