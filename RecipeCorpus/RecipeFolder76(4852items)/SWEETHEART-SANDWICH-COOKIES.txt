Title: SWEETHEART SANDWICH COOKIES
Categories: Goldilocks, Cookies
Yield: 36 Servings
1/4 lb Unsalted butter
1 1/4 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
FILLING:
4 tb Unsalted butter
1 ts Vanilla extract
4 c  Confectioner's sugar
Whipping cream
To make the cookies, cream the butter with the sugar in a large bowl
until light. Beat in eggs and vanilla; set aside. Sift the cocoa,
flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Stir the dry
ingredients thoroughly into the butter mixture. Cover the bowl with
plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 or 3 hours. Preheat the oven to
375F and butter 2 cookie sheets. Using a teaspoon measure, roll level
teaspoons of the dough into balls and place them 2 inches apart on
the sheets. Bake for 10 to 15 mins, until cookies are puffed and
surfaces slightly dry and cracked. Cool on racks.

To make the filling, cream the butter until light. Beat in the
vanilla and powdered sugar, adding whipping cream and continuing to
beat until the consistency is like creamy frosting. When the cookies
are complete cool, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of iflling on the
bottom of one cookie, then top with the bottom side of another cookie.

Makes about 3 dozen sandwiches.

Variation: For half a batch of vanilla-filled and half a batch of
peppermint-filled cookies, add 1/8 teaspoon peppermint extract to
half the filling.  Tint the peppermint filling pink or green before
filling half the sandwiches.
