Title: SUPERIOR WHIPPING CREAM
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Cups
1/2 c  Whipping cream
2 ts Vanilla sugar
-(or use white sugar
-and about 1/2 t
-vanilla extract)
Shake the carton of whipping cream well and pour it into the blender
or food processor. Add the vanilla sugar (see below if you don't know
what vanilla sugar is.)

Whip the cream in the machine.  If it's a food processor, leave the
pushing device out; if a blender, remove the center of the lid, or
just cover the top of the jar with your hand. The trick is to allow
lots of air into the cream. Run the machine for no more than five
seconds at a time, to avoid making butter. The cream is done when it
holds a peak.

NOTES:

*  A simple way to make whipped cream extra yummy -- There is almost
no dessert that can't be improved by adding a dollop of whipping
cream. Unfortunately, most people seem to be afraid of actually
whipping the cream, so they buy the awful stuff that comes in a
pressurized can, or spend money on expensive devices to inject gas
into the cream. (Or worse, they use Cool Whip.) The truth is that
making your own whipped cream is trivial, with the appropriate
mechanical aids. Yield: makes about 2 cups.

*  If you don't know what vanilla sugar is, don't panic. My mother
makes this variation in a separate sugar container; fill the
container with sugar, add a vanilla bean and wait. After a week or
two, the sugar will take on the vanilla flavor. Use this sugar
whenever a recipe calls for sugar and vanilla extract; just remember
to keep the container full.

*  If you don't have vanilla sugar around, use regular sugar and
vanilla extract for the cream.
