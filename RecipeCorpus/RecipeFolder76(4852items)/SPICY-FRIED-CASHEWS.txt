Title: SPICY FRIED CASHEWS
Categories: Oriental, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2 lb Raw cashews
1 c  Oil, preferably peanut
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/4 ts Five spice powder
HEAT A WOK OR LARGE DEEP PAN until it is hot, then add the oil. When
the oil begins to smoke lightly, deep-fry the cashew nuts for 2
minutes or until they begin to turn lightly brown. While the cashew
nuts are browning, start another frying pan heating. Remove the nuts
from the oil with a slotted spoon and add them directly to the frying
pan. HINT: Take the cashew nuts out of the oil when they are lightly
browned as they continue cooking even after they are taken out of the
oil. Save the oil in which the nuts have been cooked, as it can be
used again. Add the salt, pepper, chili powder and five spice powder
and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until the cashew nuts are well coated
with the spice. Allow to cool and serve with drinks.
