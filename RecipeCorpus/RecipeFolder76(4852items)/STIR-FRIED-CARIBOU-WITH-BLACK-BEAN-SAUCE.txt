To make sauce: Soak the beans in water overnight, rinse and drain.
Combine black beans, stock, ginger, garlic, chile and vinegar in a
saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer,
covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Pour into blender or
food processor, add the salt and blend until smooth. Return to the
saucepan and hold over a low heat.

To make stir-fry: Trim all the fat from meat and cut, against the
grain, into quarter-inch strips. Place oil in a nonstick skillet or
wok over high heat. Add the meat and stir fry for a few seconds. Add
ginger, garlic, celery, mushrooms and onion; stir fry until
vegetables are tender-crisp. Add sprouts and and a cup of the sauce,
cover and cook a further 30-40 seconds and remove from heat.

Serve with steamed rice and pass the rest of the sauce at the table.
