Title: TANTE CHRISTA'S BEEF TENDERLOIN
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Beef tenderloin, roast,
-London Broil - whatever
3    Cloves garlic
Salt
2 ts Mustard
Parsley
2    Celery leaves, cut fine
2 ts Basil
2 ts Marjoram
2 ts Thyme
Ground pepper
12 tb Olive oil (optional)
Honey
Combine all of the ingredients except honey and the meat. Spread the
honey on the meat and then spread everything else on. Spray the
baking pan or rack, and bake at 500 degrees (yes, 500 degrees) for
30-35 minutes. For thinner cuts of meat, decrease time. (Use a meat
thermometer if you are wishy washy)

We used a thin cut when we got this recipe and left out the olive
oil, but I think that if you where using a thick cut of beef you
might need to put it back in.
