ash-covered coals. Grill top loin steaks, uncovered. 15 to 18 minutes
(top sirloin steak 17 to 21 minutes) until steaks are medium rare to
medium doneness and onion is tender, turning occasionally.

Cooks tip: To check the temperature of the coals, cautiously hold
your hand palm side down at cooking height (just above the grid).
Count the number of seconds you can hold your hand in that position
before the heat is uncomfortable and you have to pull it away; 4
seconds for medium coals.
