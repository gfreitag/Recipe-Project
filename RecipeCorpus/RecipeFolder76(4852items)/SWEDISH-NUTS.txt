Title: SWEDISH NUTS
Categories: Desserts, Christmas, Mom
Yield: 1 Quart
1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
2 lg Eggs, whites only
1 pn Salt
1 c  Sugar, granulated
1 qt Pecan halves
2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
Set aside stick of butter to melt in a long pan. (Don't use a pan
that has depressions around the side, such as for lasagna.) Preheat
oven to 300 degrees.

Separate eggs; sprinkle a pinch of salt onto the egg whites. (You can
reserve the yolks to make custards.) Beat the whites to form soft
peaks. Gradually add the sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract. Fold in
pecan halves.

Turn out pecans and spread OVER the melted butter (don't stir them
in). Cook for 15 minutes.  Take out the pan and stir the nuts. Cook
another 10 minutes, take out and stir. Repeat until the nuts are
separated and all the butter is absorbed (a little over one hour).

BE PATIENT!!!  For a long time it will look totally disgusting and
you will be sure I gave you a bogus recipe, but it works!
Theoretically you can use other nuts, but I've tried both almonds and
walnuts and was disappointed...
