Categories: Desserts, Brunch
Yield: 1 Strudel
MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
1/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Cornstarch
1    Egg white, lightly beaten
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
1 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese,
-preferably without added
-gums or stabilizers
1/2 c  Raisins
MMMMM--------------------------STRUDEL-------------------------------
1 tb Canola oil
1/2 tb Butter, melted
2 tb Fine dry breadcrumbs
8    Sheets phyllo dough (14x18
-inches), thawed if frozen
2 tb Confectioners' sugar
Phyllo dough, low in calories and fat, is a crisp counterpoint to the
creamy cheese filling.

To make filling: In a small bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch, egg
white, vanilla and lemon zest; stir gently until well combined. With
a rubber spatula, gently fold in ricotta cheese just until combined.
Gently fold in raisins. Set aside.

To make strudel: 1. Preheat oven to 350 B0F. Lightly oil a large
baking sheet or coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

2. In a small bowl, combine oil and butter. Unroll phyllo onto a
clean, dry surface; cover with wax paper and then a slightly damp tea
towel to prevent the dough from drying out.

3. Lay one sheet of phyllo on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle
with 1/2 teaspoon of the oil/butter mixture and spread it thin with a
pastry brush. (Not all the dough will be covered.) Sprinkle with 1/2
teaspoon breadcrumbs. Repeat with 7 more sheets of phyllo, aligning
each sheet over the previous ones. Over the eighth layer, sprinkle
all the remaining breadcrumbs; reserve the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons
of the oil/butter mixture.

4. Gently spoon the cheese filling in a long, 12-by-2-inch mound
along one long edge of the phyllo layers, leaving a 2-inch border
between the mound and the edges of the phyllo. Fold up the long edge
and loosely roll up the strudel. (Do not roll too tightly; the
filling will expand during baking.) Set the strudel seam-side down on
the baking sheet. Fold and tuck the open ends securely but not
tightly beneath the roll.

5. Brush the strudel with the remaining oil/butter mixture. With a
sharp paring knife, make four short (1-inch) diagonal slashes along
the top of the strudel to allow steam to escape. Bake for 35 to 40
minutes, or until the phyllo is golden brown. Carefully transfer the
strudel to a wire rack and let cool completely. Just before serving,
dust with confectioners 92 sugar.

Serve the strudel at brunch, or dress it up at dinner with a
strawberry puree.
