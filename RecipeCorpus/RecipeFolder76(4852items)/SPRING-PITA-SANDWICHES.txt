Title: SPRING PITA SANDWICHES
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Pita breads
2    Tomatoes, diced
1    Avocado, sliced
1 c  Kidney beans, canned/drained
1 c  Cheddar cheese, grated
1 c  Mushrooms, sliced
1 c  Alfalfa sprouts
1/2 c  Canola Oil
4 tb Vinegar
1/4 c  Roasted cashews
Salt & Pepper to taste
Slice pitas in half and fill with remaining ingredients, dividing
evenly. Fillings will be overflowing. Simply separate the pita halves
and pile up what's left between them. Add oil and vinegar and top
with cashews. These sandwiches are colorful, delicious, nutritious,
easy to make, and perfect for picnics, too.

(Note: Even my meat-eating friends and relatives seem to enjoy this
when served as a main dish.)
