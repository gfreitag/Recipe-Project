Title: STRAWBERRY YOGHURT MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Fruits
Yield: 12 Muffins
120 g  Margarine; 1/2 c
120 g  Sugar; 1/2 c
2    Eggs
150 g  Strawberry yoghurt; 1 pot
70 ml Milk; or more
170 g  Fresh strawberries; chopped
1 lg Lemon; juice and rind
280 g  Self-raising flour;2.5 c
Preheat oven to 350oF, prepare pans. Blend the margarine & sugar &
beat in the eggs & yoghurt & milk. Fold in the chopped strawberries,
lemon juice & rind & very carefully fold in the flour to avoid
squashing the fruit.

Spoon into Muffin cases and bake for about 20 mins, longer if frozen
fruit is used.

Variations: Any fresh berry fruit may be substituted for the
strawberries (raspberries, blackberries, blackcurrants, elderberries
or blueberries).

Adapted and TESTED by Anja: Extremely good! One of my favourites.
Tried it with strawberries and blackberries - both work well. Leave
out the Lemon if using tart fruit such as blackberries.
