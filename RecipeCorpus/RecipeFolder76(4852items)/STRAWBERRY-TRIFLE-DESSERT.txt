Prepare the custard first: Mix the cornstarch with the half & half.
Heat the milk with the sugar just to boiling in a heavy saucepan.
Remove from the heat. Stir in the cornstarch mixture. Return to heat.
Cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens. Simmer 2 or 3 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Add the vanilla and the egg yolks. Whisk until
almost cold. Cover. Chill. Prepare the trifle: Cut the cake into even
slices. Spread each with jam and reassemble the cake. Cut into 2"
cubes. Arrange the cubes in individual bowls. Sprinkle with cream
sherry. Wash and slice the strawberries. Set a few strawberries aside
for garnish. Divide the strawberries among the individual bowls. Pour
the custard over the strawberries and cake in the bowls. Drizzle with
a little strawberry jam. Cover each bowl. Chill. Whip the cream until
soft peaks form. Add the sugar and vanilla. Garnish each trifle with
some sliced strawberries. Top with whipped cream. Chill briefly.
Serve.
