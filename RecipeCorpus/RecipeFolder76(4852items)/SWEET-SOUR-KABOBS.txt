~----------------- Drain the pineapple slices and reserve the syrup
for later use in the recipe.  Mix the meat and the 1 TBLS of soy
sauce. Shape the mixture into 36 meatballs.  Place the meatballs in a
glass bowl or plastic bag. Mix the reserved pineapple syrup, the
brown sugar, vinegar, and 2 TBLS of soy sauce until the sugar is
dissolved.  Pour over the meatballs and refrigerate for at least 3
hours.  Drain the marinade from the meatballs into a small saucepan,
stir in the cornstarch. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture
thickens and boils.  Boil and stir for 1 minute. Remove the sauce
from the heat and set aside. Cut the pineapple slices into quarters.
On each of 6 12-inch metal skewers alternate 6 meatballs with
pineapple and vegetables.  Brush the kabobs with part of the sauce.
Set the oven control at broil and/or 550 degrees F. Broil kabobs
4-inches from the heat to the desired doneness, about 15 to 20
minutes. Brush occasionally with the sauce and gently push with a
fork to turn.
