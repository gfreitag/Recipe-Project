Title: SUBSTITUTE MALT POWDER
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 8 Servings
Wheat berries
I read an interesting thing in a natural foods cookbook the other
day. They said to make your own malt by sprouting wheat berries,
drying them in an oven, and then running them through a blender until
they turn to powder.

Supposedly the stuff keeps forever and you can use it a spoonful at
at time in bread recipes.
