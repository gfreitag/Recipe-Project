Title: THE BORDER GRILL'S CINCO DE MAYO MARGARITA
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Lime, cut into 5 slices
Margarita or kosher salt
2 oz Anejo tequila
1 oz Orange liqueur*
1 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2    Coffee cup ice cubes
*such as Triple Sec

Arrange 3 lime slices on a small plate and cover another plate with
the salt to a depth of 1/4 inch. Place a martini glass upside down on
the limes and press and turn to dampen. Then dip in the salt to coat
the rim.

Combine the tequila, orange liqueur, lemon juice and ice in a blender.
Blend at high speed until smooth. Pour into the prepared glass,
garnish with the remaining lime slices and serve.

Note:

To make 8 margaritas, mix 2 cups tequila, 1 cup Triple Sec and 1/2 cup
freshly squeezed lemon juice. Prepare in 3 batches; shake or blend a
third of the mix with about 1 coffee cup ice for each batch.
