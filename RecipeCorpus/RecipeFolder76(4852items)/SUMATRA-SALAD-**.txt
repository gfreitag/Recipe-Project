1    Piece Lemon Zest, About 1"
1/4 c  Vanilla Yogurt
This simple but rather exotic composed salad marries crisp fresh
vegetables and smooth tofu with a spicy peanut dressing for an
unusual Indonesian inspired taste.
~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Steam the beans, cabbage and carrots for 2 to 3
minutes, or until tender-crisp, and cool. Arrange the cooked
vegetables, cucumber, sprouts and tofu on a serving platter.

In a small saucepan, mix the peanut butter, water, lemon juice,
Tabasco sauce, salt, garlic and lemon peel; stir over low heat until
smooth. Remove from the heat and discard the garlic and lemon zest.
Stir in the yogurt. Serve the dressing warm over the salad.

Lagniappe - One-quarter teaspoon of Tabasco sauce perks up any salad
dressing.  Use more for a spicier taste.
