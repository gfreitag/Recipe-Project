Categories: Muffins, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
12    Regular muffins
Bursting with berries, these are the best blueberry muffins of all.
The secret is an extra half cup of blueberries, which are mashed and
then added to the batter.

1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated
sugar,or slightly less depending on tartness of blueberries 2 large
eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4
teaspoon salt 2 1/2 cups blueberries (mash 1/2 cup with a fork) 2
cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup milk 1 tablespoon sugar mixed with 1/4
teaspoon ground nutmeg

Heat oven to 375 F. Grease 12 regular muffin cups, including the area
between each cup, or use foil baking cups.

In a medium-size bowl, beat butter until creamy. Beat in the sugar
until pale and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in vanilla,
baking powder, and salt.

Mix mashed berries into batter.

Fold in half the flour with a spatula, then half the milk. Add the
remaining flour and milk. Fold in remaining blueberries.

Scoop batter into muffin cups. Sprinkle with nutmeg sugar.

Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Let muffins cool at
least 30 minutes in the pan before removing.
