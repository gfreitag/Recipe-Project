Title: SUN-DRIED TOMATO-NOODLE PUDDING
Categories: Side dish, Cheese/eggs, Pasta
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Sun-dried tomatoes
2 c  Whipping cream
2 c  Milk
4 oz Egg noodles
2 tb Olive oil, any kind
8    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/2 lb Grated Cheddar cheese
1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese
- in 1/2-in pieces
IF THE DRIED TOMATOES are packed in oil, drain them and pat them dry
on paper towels. If dried tomatoes are not packed in oil, combine
them with 1 cup of cream and let stand to soften for 30 minutes.
Drain tomatoes, saving cream for later. Roughly chop dried tomatoes
and place in a medium mixing bowl. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to
a boil on the stove over high heat, add the egg noodles and cook 4
minutes, keeping them al dente. Drain, place in mixing bowl with
tomatoes and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Grease an 8-by-10-inch
baking dish with remaining olive oil. Preheat oven to 325F. In
another bowl, combine eggs, reserved cream and remaining 1 cup milk,
salt and pepper and beat well. Add the Cheddar and mozzarella cheeses
to the noodles and  mix. Add the cream mixture and pour into baking
dish. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and place in a larger pan
filled with boiling water and place in oven until the pudding is set,
about 35 minutes. The pudding is done when it has puffed slightly and
a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from water
bath and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
