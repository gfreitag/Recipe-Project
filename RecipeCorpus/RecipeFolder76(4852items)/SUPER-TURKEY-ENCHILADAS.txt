Just tried this last night and it was so good I wanted to share it.
It's from the back of a can of El Paso enchilada sauce - but I
substituted cooked turkey from our last "bird" that I had in the
freezer. I originally called for cooked shredded beef. Combine
turkey, onion and 1/2 cup cheese and set aside. Combine soups and
sauce. Dip tortillas in hot oil a few seconds on each side to ..
soften. (I used the microwave to heat them up) Top each with a
heaping tablespoon turkey mixture, roll up and place seam side down
in 13x9 inch baking dish. Pour sauce over and top with 1 cup cheese.
Bake 350 degrees for 1/2 hour.
