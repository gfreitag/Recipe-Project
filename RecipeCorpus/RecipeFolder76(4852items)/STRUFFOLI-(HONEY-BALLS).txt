Categories: Desserts, Italian, Holiday, Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
3 ea Large eggs
1 tb Butter; softened
1 ts Sugar; plus
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Honey
1 x  Vegetable oil; f
1 x  Colored sprinkle
Whisk together:  eggs, butter, 1 tsp sugar until foamy. Add baking
powder; add flour.  Work the mixture into a soft dough with your
hands. Divide dough into 4 pieces. On a floured surface, roll each
piece into a rope about the width of your index finger and 12 inches
long. Cut the ropes into 1" pieces.  Toss the pieces with enough
flour to dust them lightly and shake off excess flour. Heat oil to
375F in a deep fryer. Fry the struffoli a few handfuls at a time
until they puff up and are golden brown. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer to a paper towel to drain. Combine the honey and the 1/2
cups sugar in a large saucepan over low heat; stirring until the
sugar has dissolved; keep warm over low heat. Add the fried balls, a
few at a time, and turn them with a wooden spoon to coat on all
sides. Transfer the balls to a large platter and mound them into a
pyramid, shaping with wet hands. Sprinkle with the colored sprinkles
and let stand for 1 to 2 hours.  Then just break off some pieces with
your hands to eat.
