In India, meat that has been marinated in a mixture of yogurt and
spices is roasted in a giant urn-shaped clay oven called a tandoor.
Use this marinade with poultry, lamb or seafood

Drain yogurt in a cheesecloth lined colander in the refrig- erator
for 2 hours. Reserve the liquid for another use (baking or sauces).

Place the drained yogurt in a bowl and stir in the remaining
ingredients. Discard bay leaves before cooking.

Makes 1 3/4 cups.
