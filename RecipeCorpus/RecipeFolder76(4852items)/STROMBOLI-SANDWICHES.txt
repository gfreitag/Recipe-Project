Title: STROMBOLI SANDWICHES
Categories: Sandwich
Yield: 3 Servings
1 1/2 lb Ground beef
1/4 c  Minced onion
1 pk Spaghetti sauce mix (dry)
1/2 c  Water
Salt and pepper
Shredded Mozzarella cheese
6    Hoagie rolls
Brown ground beef and onion; drain well.  Stir in sauce mix and water.
Simmer for 5 minutes.  Salt and pepper to taste. Split hoagie rolls.
Lightly butter each half and sprinkle with garlic powder. Place bun
bottoms on foil-lined cookie sheet.  Brown under broiler. Spread 1/6
of ground beef mixture on each roll. Top with cheese. Broil until
cheese melts and starts to brown.  Brown bun tops and place on each
sandwich. I add extra seasonings to the ground beef to make it
spicier. Fol wrap each sandwich individually and serve. Randy Rigg
