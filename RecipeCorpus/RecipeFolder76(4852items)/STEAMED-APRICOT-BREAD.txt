Title: STEAMED APRICOT BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Rolled oats
2/3 c  Brown rice flour
1/4 c  Amaranth flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Almonds
3/4 c  Boiling water
1/3 c  Molasses or honey
1/2 ts Pure almond extract
1/2 c  Dried apricots
Servings: Makes 1 loaf.

In a large bowl, combine the oats, rice flour, amaranth flour and
baking soda.

Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a blender. Gradually add enough
water to bring the level up to 1 cup. With the machine running, add
the molasses or honey and almond extract. Add the apricots and
process with a few on/off turns to chop them; do not puree.

Pour the liquid mixture into the flour bowl.  Stir to mix. Turn out
into an oiled 1 qt. mold or 1 lb can. Cover with a square of wax
paper or foil (shiny side down); tie wax paper securely with a piece
of string.

Place the mold on a wire rack in a Dutch oven or large stockpot. Add
enough boiling wate to the pot to come halfway up the sides of the
mold. Cover the pot tightly, and steam the bread over med-low heat
for 2 hours. Do not remove the cover during the cooking time.

Remove the mold from the pot.  Cool the bread in the mold for 15 min,
then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. For best results,
slice with a serrated knife.

Variations:  Replace the rice flour with 1/3 c rice polish and 1/3 c
rice bran.  You can also replace the amaranth flour with either 1/4 c
soy flour, 1/4 c white buckwheat flour or 1/4 c ground sunflower
seeds.
