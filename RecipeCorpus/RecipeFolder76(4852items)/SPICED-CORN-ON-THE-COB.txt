This wonderful recipe is inspired by an idea given to me by an Indian
friend. The slices of corn cob are poached in an aromatic, spicy
sauce with a yogurt base, and are sumptuously delicious. It makes a
complete meal if served with the simple mushroom curry.

Mix the spices together and stir into a paste with the water. Fry the
corn cob pieces in the oil until browned all over, and set aside.
Then fry the onion, ginger and garlic for a few minutes until
softened, and stir in the spice paste. Cook gently for 2-3 minutes
and then stir in the yogurt gradually. Season to taste with salt and
return the corn to the pan. Heat through gently and it is ready to
serve.
