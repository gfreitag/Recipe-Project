Title: TEMPURA AHI ROLL
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 lb Fresh Ahi Tuna or other
Sushi style fish
2 ea Nori Paper
1 ea Cucumber sliced lengthwise
1 ea Carrot sliced lengthwise
Toasted sesame seeds
Oil for deep frying
1 c  Flour
1 c  Club Soda
1 ea Egg yolk
Slice ahi to 1/4 inch thick rectangle 4 to 6 inches on either side.
Roll two slices each of the carrot and cucumber inside the tuna. Roll
the tuna inside a sheet of the seaweed paper and seal sheet with a
dab of water. Prepare the deep fryer by heating the oil to 350 to
370    F.

Prepare the tempura batter by mixing the flour, egg yolk and club
soda. The amount of flour and soda should be modified to give the
tempura the right consistency.  The batter should be thick enough to
coat, but runny enough to spread easily.

When oil is ready, coat the roll in batter and deep fry for no more
than three minutes when the batter becomes a light golden color. Left
over carrots and cucumber or other vegitables (mushrooms come out
great) can be tempura fried as well.  Remove from oil and drain on a
paper towel.

Trim off ends to make a flat surface for presentation.  Slice in half
diagonally, then slice each half into two pieces, one flat on both
sides and one with one diagonal and one flat side.  The ahi should be
only slightly cooked on the outter edge, but should remain mostly raw
throughout.  Stand roll on edge on plate and sprinkle with sesame
seeds. Can be served with ponzu, soy or soy-wasabi sauce.
