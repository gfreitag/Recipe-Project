Title: SWEET & SOUR RED SQUASH WITH MINT
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Banana squash
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
4    Cloves garlic; peeled and
-lightly crushed
1/4 c  Mint leaves; coarse chop
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1/4 c  Sugar
Salt & pepper to taste
This should marinate for several hours before serving. It lasts for
several days refrigerated.

Cut squash across into 3-inch-wide lengths. Use a vegetable peeler to
remove the peel. Cut each piece crosswise into slices that a little
over 1/4-inch thick.

Place the olive oil and garlic cloves in a medium saute pan. Saute the
garlic over low heat until it turns a golden brown. Discard the
garlic.

Cook the squash in the oil on both sides until they blister and turn
golden brown. Cook the squash in batches, one layer at a time and
without crowding the pan. Use a thin wooden skewer to check for
tenderness. The squash slices should be tender but hold their shape.

As each batch is cooked, transfer the slices to a platter. When all
the squash is cooked, sprinkle the chopped mint over the top. Add to
the remaining olive oil in the pan the vinegar, sugar, and salt and
pepper to taste. Stir well and raise the heat to high. Let the
mixture boil until it thickens slightly. Pour the hot liquid over the
squash slices. Let cool.
