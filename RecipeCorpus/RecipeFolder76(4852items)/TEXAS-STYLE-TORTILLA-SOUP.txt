10 1/2 oz Broth, chicken condensed
-OR 2 bouillon cubes & water
10 1/2 oz Soup, tomato, condensed
1 c  -Water
1/2 c  Pace picante sauce
2 ts Sauce, Worcestershire

1/2 c  Cheese, cheddar (2 oz);

2 lb Stew meat, boneless (option)
2 c  Chicken mixture; (optional)
-from Chicken Flautas recipe
1. Cook onion, garlic, and stew meat (if using as main course), in
oil in Dutch oven until onion is tender but not brown; drain well.
Add tomatoes (with juice) to Dutch oven with remaining ingredients
except tortillas and cheese.
2. Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  Simmer uncovered 1 hour.
3. Add tortillas; continue simmering 10 minutes. Ladle into soup
bowls; sprinkle with cheese and serve with additional picante sauce.

Makes 6 to 8 servings, about 9 cups soup.

**NOTE: This is so delicious, no one will believe how easy it is to
make. My "variations" are listed as the "OR" in ingredients...found
it to taste the same.  I usually don't even mess with the tortillas
and cheese. It tastes wonderful served with "Chicken Flautas"...or
just make the chicken as indicated in the Flauta recipe (except chunk
the chicken) and just toss into this soup! I think this could also
easily be adapted to crockpot!

Note from Pace: This spicy, tortilla-topped soup owes its authentic
south-of-the-border flavor to PACE picante sauce and slow, siesta-like
simmering. Source: Pace Picante 40th Anniversary Cookbook
