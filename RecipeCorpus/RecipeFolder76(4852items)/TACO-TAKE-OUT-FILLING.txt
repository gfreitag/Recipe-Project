Categories: Meats, Beef, Ethnic
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Ground chuck
1 c  Onion -- chop
1    Green pepper -- chop
1 ts Mustard seeds
3 tb Beef bouillon powder -- or
1 ts Chili powder
1/8 ts Tabasco
1 ts Cumin powder
1 1/2 c  Bottled chili sauce
1/3 c  Sweetpickle relish
1 sm Can tomato paste
6 oz Water tomato Paste can
3 tb Dark molasses
10 1/2 oz Beef broth
Hot fried taco shells
Lettuce -- shred
Monterey Jack Cheese-grate
Pack beef into ungreased 10" skillet on medium heat. Cover and let
simmer, reducing to low heat after 5 minutes. You don't really want
to overbrown the beef, but to allow some moisture to combine with the
natural fat in the chuck to create a broth while it simmer. Depending
on the percentage of fat content in the beef, I'd let it steam like
this for about 12-15 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain liquid from beef
into blender with HALF of the beef. With on/off speed blend this
mixture until it resembles a brick-layer's mortar. To the mixture of
pulvarized beef and the remaining half which you did not put into the
blender, add onion, green pepper, mustard seed, bouillon powder and
chili powder. Stir in hotpepper sauce, cumin powder, chili sauce,
sweet pickle relish, tomato paste, water, molasses and beef broth.
(If you like a thinner sauce, add more beef broth). Simmer this
uncovered, stirring frequently to prevent scorching or use your slow
cooker on "high" for about 2 hours. On top of the range, simmer 1
hour, adding additional liquid as necessary tokeep sauce consistency.
Spoon it into the fried taco shells. Top it off  with lettuce, grated
cheese and Taco 5 Alarm Sauce. Source: Gloria Pitzer Presents The
