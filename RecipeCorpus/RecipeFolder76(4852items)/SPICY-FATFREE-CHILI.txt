Title: SPICY FATFREE CHILI
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Uncooked hard wheat berries
2    Onions chopped
2 c  Cooked pinto beans
3 tb (approx) cinnamon
1/4 c  (approx) chili powder
1    16 oz. jar picante sauce
2    14 5 oz. cans chili
Tomatoes
1    4 5 oz. can green chilis
1    7 oz. can jalapeno relish
Cook the wheat berries in 2.5 cups of water (it will take about an
hour). Combine the remaining ingredients and simmer while the wheat
berries are cooking.   Add the wheat berries when they are done and
enjoy!

If the wheat berries do not absorb all the water, drain them before
adding to the chili.  They should be a little chewy. I didn't measure
the cinnamon or chili powder; the measurements should be close
though. The pinto beans were fresh.
