Title: STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 24 Servings
2 md Onions; finely chopped
2 tb Butter
20 oz Frozen spinach
- thawed and drained
2 lb Whole-milk ricotta cheese
2    Eggs; slightly beaten
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped parsley
2 tb Fresh herbs
-(Oregano, summer savory,
- Chervil, etc.)
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Nutmeg; to taste
16    Halves of chicken breast
-(order the chicken boned,
- split, with the skin on)
Saute the onions in butter until soft.  Combine with the other
ingredients (except chicken) and mix well. Season highly. Place each
breast skin side up on a board. Trim away excess fat. Loosen skin
from 1 side of breast and stuff approximately 1/3 cup of the filling
under the skin. Tuck the skin and meat under breast, forming an even,
round, dome shape. Put the stuffed breasts in a buttered Pyrex or
metal baking dish. Fifteen minutes before baking, preheat over to 350
F (175 C). Bake breasts until golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.
Don't overcook or chicken will be dry. Cool slightly before serving,
and cool to room temperature if you are going to slice into smaller
serving pieces. Arrange on platters and decorate with fresh herbs.
