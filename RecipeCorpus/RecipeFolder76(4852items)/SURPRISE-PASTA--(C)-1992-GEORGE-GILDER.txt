place each half, cut side down and slice 1/4" slices. Slice the
peppers in half and core and seed them. With a sharp knife, cut very
thin julienned slices of half, if the peppers are large, or whole
peppers if smaller. In a large pot, add cold water. When boiled, add
pasta, occasionally stirring to separate the pieces. Always time
pasta after it re-boils. After seven minutes, taste a piece to see if
it is cooked. When cooked to taste, drain and put back into pot (turn
off flame) with a tbs margarine. Stir to coat. Heat a ten inch Teflon
coated saute pan with half the oil. On med-low heat, saute the onion.
before it just starts to brown, add the pepper pieces. saute for a
couple of minutes. Add mushrooms until they are coated with oil,
about 90 seconds. Remove to a bowl, leaving perhaps a three
tablespoons of mixture in pan. While the vegetables are cooking,
prepare the chicken by washing and drying the pieces. Place the
flavored flour into a small plastic bag. Add the chicken and shake
the bag to coat. Place the rest of the oil into the pan, turn up heat
to medium and saute the chicken until light brown on both sides. Do
not over cook. Add thyme and the cooked vegetables to the pan. Cover
the chicken. Add 1/4 cup cold water to deglaze with the vinegar and
juice. Lower the flame and simmer for five minutes until chicken is
cooked through, but moist. Place pasta into plates and spoon rich
brown mixture over top. Add chicken pieces and arrange over pasta.
it's very good!
