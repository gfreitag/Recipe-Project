ROASTED GARLIC CREME BRULEE Cut off the flat end of 2 or 3 cloves of
garlic and separate the whole cloves, leaving the "skin" intact. Trim
so head will sit flat. Place the garlic heads, cut side down, on a
cookie sheet lined with foil. Drizzle lightly with 2 teaspoons olive
oil. Fold the foil into a packet and bake at 350 for 1 hour and then
allow to cool. When garlic is cool enough to handle, gently squeeze
the pulp from each clove. Reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon, omit the
vanilla , add 1 teaspoon salt and the garlic pulp to the custard
mixture. Place custard mixture in the blender and process until
smooth. Continue as directed in the basic recipe, baking 40 minutes.

ONION CREME BRULEE Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over low
heat and add 1 cup coarsely chopped onion and cook, stirring
occasionally , 45 minutes or until completely caramelized. Reduce
sugar to 1 tablespoon, omit the vanilla and add 1 scant teaspoon salt
and then the onions to the custard mixture. Process in an electric
blender until smooth. Proceed with the basic recipe, baking for 50
minutes.

ROQUEFORT-and-BLACK PEPPER CREME BRULEE Reduce sugar to 1 tablespoon,
omit the vanilla and add 1/4 cup Roquefort cheese and 1 teaspoon
freshly ground black pepper to the custard mixture. Blend in an
electric blender until smooth. Proceed with the basic recipe, baking
for 45 minutes.
