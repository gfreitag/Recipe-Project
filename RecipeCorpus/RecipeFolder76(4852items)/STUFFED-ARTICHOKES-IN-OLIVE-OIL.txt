Title: STUFFED ARTICHOKES IN OLIVE OIL
Categories: Main dish, Turkish
Yield: 6 Servings
6 lg Artichokes
Water
4 ea Lemons
2 tb Flour
1 lb Fresh green fava beans
1 1/4 c  Olive oil
3 ea Finely chopped onions
Salt
1/2 c  Rice
2 ts Sugar
3/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
Lemon wedges for garnish
Mix juice of 2 lemons & the flour in a large bowl. Add 2 qt water &
mix thoroughly.  Wash artichokes, bend back & snap off outer leaves.
Leave only the tender inner leaves. Slice off these leaves just above
the heart & scoop out the fuzzy choke & remaining pinkish leaves. Cut
off the stem & peel around the base with a vegetable peeler until you
reach the whitish tender part.  As you trim each artichoke, take a
lemon half, sprinkle it with salt & rub it all around & inside the
base to prevent discoloration. Then drop each artichoke into the
lemon water mixture.

Remove jackets of fava beans.  Sprinkle beans with salt & let stand
for 5 minutes.  Remove skins, rinse & reserve.

Heat 1 c olive oil in skillet.  Add onions, 1/2 ts salt & saute for 5
minutes.  Stir in fava beans & rice. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring, &
add 1/2 c water. Cover & cook for 5 minutes till the water has been
absorbed. Stir in the dill, salt & remove from heat. Let stand
covered for 15 minutes.

Remove artichokes from water bath.  Reserve 4 1/2 c liquid. Stuff
centre cavity of artichokes with the rice. Place each one on a sheet
of wax paper, sprinkle with a little water & wrap as you would a
package. Arrange them stem sides down in a heavy shallow pan. Add 1
1/2 c reserved liquid, 1/4 c olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon & sugar.
Cover & cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to low &
simmer for 1 hour. The liquid will be continually absorbed so add
more as needed. When the artichokes are tender, let them cool,
Unwrap them & arrange them on a serving platter. Serve cold with
garnish as part of a buffet.
