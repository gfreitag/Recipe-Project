Cut the tofu into squares. Make a marinade with the crushed garlic
cloves, ginger, enough soy sauce to cover the tofu, and as much
cayenne as you want. (I use a lot! 1/4 tsp)

Marinate the tofu as long as you can, ideally at least 2 hours.

Chop the fresh vegetables.

Cook the noodles according to the package directions.

Heat oil in your wok or pan, add tofu and marinade while hot. Stir fry
until the tofu is heated through. Add veggies and stir fry as normal.
Before you serve, add noodles and stir to coat. If you want the
cashews, put them in before you serve.
