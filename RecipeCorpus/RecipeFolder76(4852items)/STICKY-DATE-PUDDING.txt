Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------PUDDING-------------------------------
380 g  Stoneless dates
500 ml Water
380 g  Sugar
380 g  Selfraising flour
2 t  Bicarb of soda
125 g  Butter, melted
4 lg Egg yolks
1/2 t  Vanilla essence
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
300 g  Brown sugar
300 ml Cream
125 g  Butter
Vanilla essence to taste
Combine the dates and the water in a saucepan and bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer until the dates have reduced to a jam-like
consistancy.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, bicarb of soda, melted
butter, egg yolks and beat to a smooth batter.
Preheat the oven to 185xC. Grease eight dariole moulds or other
suitable containers (or one large baking dish). Stand the moulds or
dish in an oven tray containing 3cm of warm water.
Stir the dates into the batter and pour at once into the moulds or
dish. Place in the oven and bake for about 1 hour or until a skewer
inserted into the centre comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and let stand for a minute or two, then invert
onto plates to serve.
In the meantime, prepare the sauce by melting the butter in a
non-stick saucepan. Add the sugar and cook until it has dissolved,
then add the cream and simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring
frequently.
Pour sauce over the pudding and add King Island or other thick cream.
