Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
2 lg Vine-ripened tomatoes
1/4 c  Olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper
1 sm Onion; peeled and sliced
1    Jalapeno pepper; cored and
-sliced
1    Clove garlic; minced
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
Kosher salt (optional)
2 tb Fresh basil; chopped
4    Swordfish steaks (6 oz each)
-cut at least 2 inches thick
3 tb Parsley chopped
Core the tomatoes and cut them into thick slices. Brush both sides of
the slices with oil and season generously with pepper.

Heat a large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until
hot. Lay the tomato slices in the pan in one layer and cook for 2 to
3 minutes on each side to char. Lift the tomato slices from the pan
and set aside on a plate.  Repeat the procedure until all the slices
have been charred.

Put the onion slices in the same pan and cook over high heat for 2 to
3 minutes, stirring, until the onions begin to brown. Add the chopped
basil and keep warm. Season the swordfish steaks with a little salt
and pepper. Brush both sides of each with the remaining oil.

Heat the same or another large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet
over high heat until hot. Alternately, prepare a charcoal, wood, or
gas grill or preheat a broiler.  Cook the swordfish for 3 to 4
minutes to a side for medium.  Do not overcook.  Put a swordfish
steak in the center of each plate and spoon the warm tomato
vinaigrette over it. Sprinkle with parsley. Source:  Hearth-Healthy
