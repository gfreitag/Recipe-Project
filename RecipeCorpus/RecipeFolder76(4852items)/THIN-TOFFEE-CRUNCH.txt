Line 2 cooky sheets with foil; grease foil.  In a heavy 2 qt.
saucepan, stir together sugar, corn syrup, and cream until well
blended.

Stirring constantly, cook over medium-low heat until mixture boils.

Add butter or margarine.  Continue cooking, stirring occasionally,
until temp. reaches 285 degrees F. on a candy thermometer or until
small amount dropped into very cold water seperates into threads
which are hard, but not brittle...about 30 min..  Pour onto greased
foil-lined cooky sheets; spread with greased spatula to cover entire
surface.

Cool.  Spread with chocolate glaze.  chill 1 hour. Break into pieces.
Store in a single layer in a tightly covered container in a cool
place. Makes about

Chocolate glaze-  In a small saucepan, melt 2 squares (2 oz) semi
sweet chocolate, 2 squares (2 oz) UN sweetened chocolate, 1/4 cup
butter or margarine, and 1 T. light corn syrup over low heat. Stir
until smooth. Remove from heat;  pour over toffee, spreading evenly.

NOTE:  I like to sprinkle chopped walnuts or almonds over toffee on
top of the chocolate glaze....more like See's Victoria Toffee that
way!
