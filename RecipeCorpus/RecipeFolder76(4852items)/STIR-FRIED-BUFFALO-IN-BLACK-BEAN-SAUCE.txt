This recipe comes from the Stonehouse Restaurant at San Ysidro Ranch
in California. It's an example of how executive chef Gerard Thompson
combines ingredients, flavors and textures of diverse ethnic origins.

To make sauce: Combine black beans, chicken stock, ginger, garlic,
chile and vinegar in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until beans are
tender, about 1 hour. Pour into blender or food processor, add the
salt and blend until smooth.

To make breadsticks: While sauce is simmering, preheat oven to 375
degrees. Combine warm milk, baking powder, green onions, salt and
pepper; mix well. Add flour and knead until the dough becomes smooth,
adding more flour if needed, about 3 to 5 minutes. Allow to rest
30    minutes at room temperature.

Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a bread
stick and place them on a baking sheet that has been sprayed with
nonstick vegetable coating. Lightly spray the bread sticks with the
nonstick coating and bake until golden brown on the bottom, about 10
to 15 minutes. Turn bread sticks over and bake until other side is
lightly browned, about 5 more minutes.

To make stir-fry: Trim all visible fat from meat and cut, against the
grain, into quarter-inch strips. Place oil in a nonstick skillet or
wok over high heat. Immediately add meat and toss two times. Add
ginger and garlic and toss two more times. Add carrot, chile and
onion, toss twice more and remove from heat. Add watercress and toss
again to mix well.

To serve: Spoon 1/2 cup sauce onto each of four warm plates. Top with
1 cup of meat mixture and arrange 3 bread sticks in a triangular
pattern on each plate.

Note: When preparing fresh chilies, wear rubber gloves for protection
against oils that later can cause burning sensation on skin.
