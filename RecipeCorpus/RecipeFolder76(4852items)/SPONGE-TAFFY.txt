Title: SPONGE TAFFY
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
1 tb Baking soda
Put first 3 ingredients in saucepan and put on medium heat. Stir
until all sugar dissolves before boiling starts.Cook to 290 degrees F
on candy thermometer. Remove from heat and when all the bubbling ends
add the soda and when the mixture effervesces pour into a square cake
pan which has been well chilled but not greased. When the taffy has
risen right up put in a cold place to set. Turn out and cut with a
small saw if you want clean cut pieces.  NOTE:  This recipe comes
from a candy manufacturer who makes a specialty of sponge taffy. If
you follow all the instructions, you cannot fail. I advise you to use
a candy thermometer to insure success in any candy making. It takes
years of experience to judge by the eye alone.
