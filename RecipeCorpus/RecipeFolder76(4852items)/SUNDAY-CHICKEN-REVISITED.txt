Title: SUNDAY CHICKEN REVISITED
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Whole chicken breasts, skin
-left on (weight after
-boning, 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 lb)
3 tb Butter, cut into 6 pieces
-and slightly softened
1 ts Salt
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
3/4 ts Cornstarch, mixed with
1 tb Water
NOTE: Because most boneless chicken breasts these days come without
skin, ask your butcher to so it specially, or buy bone-in breasts and
bone them yourself.

Preheat the oven to 425'F. Rub the chicken breasts on all sides with
butter; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fold each breast in half, skin
side out, stretching the skin as much as possible to cover the meat.
Hold the "bundle" together by running through with wooden or metal
skewers.

Bake on the rack of a roasting pan for 25-30 minutes, or until an oven
thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken registers
155-160'F. Remove to a cutting board. Loosely cover with aluminum
foil to keep warm.

Meanwhile, add the broth to the roasting pan. Scrape the pan with a
wooden spatula to dissolve the meat juices. Pour this liquid into a
fat separator (or a regular measuring cup) and wait a bit for the fat
to rise to the top. Pour off (or spoon off) the fat. Pour the
defatted liquid into a small pan and bring to a rapid boil. Boil down
to 3/4 cup of liquid. Stir in the dissolved cornstarch, and cook
until the gravy thickens slightly.

Discard the chicken skin, if you like. Cut each breast diagonally into
about eight long, thin slices. Arrange on a platter and pass the gravy
separately.
