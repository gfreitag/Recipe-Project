Start early (at least 4-5 hours) so it can cook all day. In a large
soup kettle, cover peas with 2 quarts cold water. Simmer for 2
minutes. Remove from heat and let stand. Add all other ingredients.
Leave soup to simmer on low heat, don't boil, for 3-4 hours Stir
occassionally. When peas are tender, run 1/3 to 1/2 of soup through
blender. Leave other part of soup as it is. Mix blended soup and
unblended soup together. Taste. You may want to adjust the seasonings
at this time. Brandon added some italian spices and salt and pepper.
