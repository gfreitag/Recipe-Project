Categories: Puddings, English
Yield: 4 Servings
3 oz Flour
Pinch of salt
1 ts Baking powder
4 oz Suet
12 oz Raisins, stoned
1 ds Sugar
Mix the flour, salt and baking powder together, then add the suet and
sufficient cold water to form a soft dough. Turn out on to a lightly
floured surface and roll into an oblong about 1/4 inch thick.
Sprinkle the raisins and the sugar on to the dough, then roll up like
a Swiss Roll, damping the ends and pressing firmly together to seal.
Sprinkle with a little flour, then wrap lightly in greaseproof paper
and roll up in a lightly floured pudding cloth, tying the ends
tightly. Place in a saucepan of boiling water and boil for 3 hours,
topping up the water as necessary. Serve cut into thick slices, and
sprinkled with a little granulated sugar and accompanied by custard.
Serves 4 to 6.
