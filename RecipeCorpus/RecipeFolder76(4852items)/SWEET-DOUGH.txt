1.  In large bowl, combine sugar, salt, yeast, and 2 cups flour. In

Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes more, occasionally
scraping bowl with rubber spatula.

occasionally scraping bowl.

4 1/2 c) to
make a soft dough.

4.  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and
elastic, about 10 minutes.  Shape into a ball.

5.  Turn over in greased large bowl to grease top; Cover; let rise in
warm place until dough is doubled, about 1 hour.

6.  Punch down dough.  On lightly floured surface, divide into pieces
as recipes direct.  Cover.  Let rest 15 minutes.
