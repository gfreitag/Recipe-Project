Title: SPICY BLACKEYED PEAS
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Oil
1 c  Chopped onion
1 lg Clove garlic, chopped
1    Tspcumin
1 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Chili powder (I use more)
1    16 oz. can blackeyed peas
(drained)
1    16 oz. can whole peeled
Tomatoes (undrained)
x  Few drops Tabasco
1 ts White vinegar
x  Salt, pepper
Saute onion, garlic, and spices in a little oil until the onions are
soft. Add the (blackeyed) peas and tomatoes. Simmer for 20 minutes or
so, breaking up the tomatoes. Add Tabasco, vinegar, salt, and pepper.
Turn off heat and stir.

Serve over rice or with grits.

I use more garlic. I rinse the blackeyed peas thoroughly. I think it
helps with gas. I chop the tomatoes before adding rather than
breaking up during cooking. I don't put on salt and pepper. I think I
use less adding it at the table. I sometimes add Louisiana hot sauce
at the table. It goes well with couscous also. He doesn't say, but
this probably servers four.

For me, adding a lettuce salad, bread, and a glass of wine or beer
makes it a complete meal.  Delicious.
