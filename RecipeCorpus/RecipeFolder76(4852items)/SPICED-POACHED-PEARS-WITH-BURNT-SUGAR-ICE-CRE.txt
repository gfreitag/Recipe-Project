Title: SPICED POACHED PEARS WITH BURNT SUGAR ICE CRE
Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  White wine
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar
Zest of 1 orange, julienned
Zest of 1 lemon, julienned
Juice of 2 lemons
Juice of 2 oranges
2    Whole cloves
2    Cinnamon sticks
4 sl Fresh ginger
6    Peppercorns
1    Vanilla bean
4    Under-ripe pears, peeled,
-cored
Burnt Sugar lee Cream (see
-recipe)
Combine the wine, water, sugar, citrus zest and juice, cloves,
cinnamon, ginger, peppercorns and vanilla bean in a heavy saucepan.
Bring to a boil, add pears, then reduce heat so the liquid barely
bubbles. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the pears are tender.  If
pears aren't completely submerged in liquid, turn them every few
minutes so they will cool evenly.

When the pears are tender, remove from liquid and set aside. Reduce
liquid to 1 cup over high heat.  Return pears to liquid and let cool
completely.

Before serving, warm the pears in their liquid over moderate heat.
Place a warm pear on a chilled plate; spoon some poaching liquid over
the top. Place a scoop of ice cream next to the pear and top with a
few threads of julienned zest from the sauce.

Serves 4.
