Categories: Oriental, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Pork spareribs
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 ts Sesame oil
1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
1 1/2 tb Chinese fermented blk. beans
-(coarsely chopped)
2 ts Finely chopped garlic
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
ASK YOUR BUTCHER to cut the spareribs into individual ribs and then
into 2-inch segments, or do it yourself with a cleaver or a sharp,
heavy knife. Rub the spareribs with salt and let them sit in a bowl
for about 20-to-25 minutes. Fill a large saucepan with water and
bring it to a boil. Turn the heat to low, add the spareribs and
simmer them for 10 minutes. Drain them and discard the water. Mix the
other ingredients together in a large bowl and stir in the spareribs,
coating them well with the mixture. Transfer the mixture to a deep
plate or dish. Set up a steamer or put a rack into a wok or large
deep pot. Pour in 2 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, and
then reduce the heat. Lower the plate of spareribs carefully into the
steamer or onto the rack. Cover it with a lid and steam gently for 1
hour or until the spareribs are very tender. Remember to keep a
careful watch on the water level, and replenish it with hot water
when necessary. Skim off any surface fat, and serve. You can make
this dish ahead of time and reheat the ribs by steaming for 20
minutes or until they are hot.
