Title: SWEET & SOUR PEPPERS WITH ALMONDS (MANDORLA
Categories: Italian, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
1/3 c  Dark raisins (2 oz.)
3 md Red bell peppers
(about 1-1/4 lbs.),
Quartered and deribbed
2 md Green bell peppers
(about 3/4 lb.),
Quartered and deribbed
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1/3 c  Slivered almonds
(1-1/2 oz.)
2 tb Sugar
3 tb Red wine vinegar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1.  In a small bowl, soak the raisins in warm water for 20 minutes;
drain and set aside. 2. If you want to peel the peppers, cut the
quartered peppers in half lengthwise and flatten slightly. Peel the
pieces with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, then cut them
lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips. Alternatively, slice unpeeled
peppers into 1/4-inch strips. 3. In a large saucepan, heat the oil
over moderate heat. Add the almonds and cook, stirring occasionally,
for 2 minutes. Add the raisins and cook for 1 minute, then stir in
the peppers, sugar, vinegar and salt. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.
Uncover and continue to cook until the peppers are very tender and
slightly glazed, 10 to 15 minutes longer. If the peppers begin to
stick to the pan, add 1 to 2 Tablespoons of warm water. Serve at room
temperature.  (This dish can also be made several hours ahead and
reheated just before serving.) This delicious and unusual pepper dish
is from Basilicata in the instep of the Italian boot. It is wonderful
with grilled meat, especially Italian sausages. Peeling the peppers
without roasting them first makes them particularly succulent, but
peeling isn't mandatory. The dish is delicious either way.
