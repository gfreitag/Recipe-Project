This version of dhal with cauliflower is nothing short of brilliant:
beautiful gentle spices, lovely textures, and amazing tastes that
linger on the palate. Serve it with basmati rice, warm chapatis and a
green salad.

Drain the lentils and put into a pan with the garam masala, chilli,
crushed garlic, sliced onion and turmeric. Cover with the coconut
milk and simmer for 12-15 minutes, until tender and soft. Add the
cauliflower and tomato and simmer for a further 10 minutes. Stir in
the yogurt and heat through. Season to taste with salt.
