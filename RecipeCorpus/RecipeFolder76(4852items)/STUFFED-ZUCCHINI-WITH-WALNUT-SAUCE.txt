Blanch the zucchini for 3-4 minutes in boiling water. Cut them in half
lengthwise, scoop out the centres and chop the pulp roughly.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pan and saut* the onion and
garlic gently for 3-4 minutes until transparent.

Put in the bulgar wheat, diced red peppers, chopped zucchini and
allspice and season well.  Add some stock if the mixture seems too
dry and cook for 10 minutes over gentle heat, stirring constantly.
Preheat the oven to 350F.

Fill the zucchini shells with the mixture.  Arrange them in a lightly
oiled ovenproof dish, brush with the remaining oil, cover with a lid
or foil and bake for 25 minutes. Serve with the walnut and garlic
sauce.

Sauce:

Put all the ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. Use
2/3 a cup of water to start with and add more if the sauce is too
thick. Let stand for 1 hour. Blend again just before serving and
garnish with finely chopped walnuts.
