Title: SUGAR-AND-SPICE BLEND
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cardamon
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1    Sprinkle
on plain toast.  French toast, waffles,
pancakes, oatmeal, vanilla pudding, cut-up apples or oranges.
2. Sprinkle over muffins before baking and store- bought pie before
warming. Note: Store in a shaker-top jar.  This will go fast. While
you're at it, keep these in mind for gifts. Just put them in a pretty
jar, and attach a few recipe suggestions with a ribbon. Makes a scant
2/3 cup.
