Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Condiments
Yield: 999 Servings
2 lb Serrano Peppers
3 1/2 lb Roma Tomatoes
1 lb Spanish Onions
24 oz Tomato Sauce
2 1/2 c  Distilled Vinegar
1/4 c  Salt
1/4 c  Black Pepper
1 lg Head Of Garlic
20    1/2 Pint Canning Jars & Lids
Clean and stem the peppers.  Clean and quarter the tomatoes and
onions. Use a food processor to shred the tomatoes, peppers and
onions. Use the largest shredding blade and don't worry about a few
large pieces. Place in a large stock pot. Puree or press the garlic
and add to the pot. Add remaining ingredients to the pot along with
enough water to keep the mixture from burning when heated. Bring the
mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Put salsa
into the canning jars and process for 15 minutes at a rolling boil
(open canning method). This salsa is tasty but quite hot. It needs
about 3 years to mellow and mature. If you really like food that is
hot it is edible immediately.
