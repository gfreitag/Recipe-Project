Title: THE ROCKETTES' FUDGE BROWNIE TART
Categories: Dessert, Chocolate, Tart, Fp
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 lb (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
1/4 c  Sugar
9 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
-chopped
1 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
-chopped
2    Eggs
1 1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
1 tb Grand Marnier
1/2 c  Chocolate chips
Preheat the oven to 350  F. Butter and flour a 10-inch tart pan with a
removable bottom. In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, combine the
butter and the sugars. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter is
melted, 4 to 6 minutes. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the
bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and process until finely
chopped, 15 to 20 seconds. Add the hot butter-sugar mixture and
process for 15 more seconds. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the
eggs and vanilla. Process to combine, about 10 seconds. Add the
flour, salt, walnuts, and Grand Marnier. Pulse briefly 10 times, just
to mix.

Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle the top
with chocolate chips. Bake 25 to 30 minutes; a toothpick inserted
near the center will come out moist. Do not overbake. Remove the
sides of the pan and cool on a wire rack. Cut into wedges and serve.

SERVES 6 TO 8.
