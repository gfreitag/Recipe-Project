Title: SPICY BROCCOLI WITH SAUSAGE
Categories: Chinese, Pork, Pasta, Coloradoan, Arlene
Yield: 3 Servings
1/2 lb Spaghetti, linguine or dried
Chinese noodles
1 bn Green onions
1 tb Minced ginger
3 lg Cloves garlic, minced
1 ea Head broccoli
1/2 lb Country sausage
3 tb Soy sauce
1/4 ts Hot red pepper flakes or red
Chili paste
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add noodles and cook 8
minutes, or until barely tender.  Trim and dice green onions. Mince
ginger and garlic. Gut stems off broccoli and cut head into small
florets. Peel stems and cut them into strips about one-fourth inch by
3 inches.

Heat wok or wide skillet over high heat and add sausage. Cook,
breaking the sausage up and stirring until sausage is browned. Pour
off all but about 1 tablespoon fat.  Add half the green onions, all
the ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute.  Add soy sauce, broccoli
florets stems and hot red pepper flakes. Stir over highest heat for
about 3 minutes; broccoli is bright green and still crisp.  Add
drained cooked noodles and toss to combine. Serve hot sprinkled with
remaining green onions. Serves 3 to 4.

I would assume that you could use zucchini when in season or try
different types of sausage.
