Title: SPINACH & MUSHROOM LASAGNA II
Categories: Main dish, Cheese, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Lasagna strips
1 3/4 lb Spinach
1 ts Margarine
1 ts Marjoram
12 oz Ricotta cheese
Salt & pepper
6 oz Mushrooms
1 oz Margarine
1/4 pt Vegetable stock
1 ts Soy sauce
3 oz Cheddar, grated
Preheat oven to 400F.  Cook lasagna in plenty of boiling water for 8
to 10 minutes.  Drain & rinse in cold water.

Prepare the spinach by washing it in several changes of cold water.
Place in a heavy bottomed pot & cook gently without adding more
water, for 6 to 8 minutes. When cooked, strain off excess water &
chop finely. Return to the pot & season well.  Put pan on a gentle
heat, add margarine & marjoram, stir & then remove from heat. When
the spinach has cooled, mix in the ricotta.  Check the seasoning.

Now prepare the sauce.  Saute the sliced mushrooms in margarine,
reduce heat & continue to cook for 10 minutes in a covered pot so
that plenty of juice is extracted. Add the stock & simmer for another
5 minutes. Puree in a blender for a few seconds.  Add soy sauce &
season to taste.

Lightly oil a square 3 pint dish, spoon in some of the spinach, cover
with 2 or 3 pieces of lasagna & then a coat of the mushroom sauce.
Repeat, ending with the mushroom sauce. Sprinkle with the grated
cheese. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes.  Serve immediately.
