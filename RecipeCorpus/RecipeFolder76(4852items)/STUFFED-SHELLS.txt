garlic until tender. Then, add meat and cook until no pink remains.
Drain. Stir in undrained tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, oregano,
basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover; and
simmer for 30 minutes. Then, set aside. Preheat oven at 350. To
prepare stuffing, bring water to a boil in a large pot and add
shells. Return to a boil, then continue cooking for 5 to 6 minutes
more, or until shells are barely tender. Drain and set aside on flat
baking sheet (to prevent sticking). In a mixing bowl, combine cottage
cheese, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg whites,
parsley, salt, and pepper. Pour 1 cup of spaghetti sauce onto bottom
of a 13 x 9 x 2" pan. Fill each shell generously with chesse mixture,
about 1 tablespoon in each shell. Place filled shells in pan. Pour
remaining spaghetti sauce over each shell, then top with remaining
mozzarella cheese. Bake for 45 minutes or until golden.
