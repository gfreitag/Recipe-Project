Title: SUMMER TOMATO SAUCE
Categories: Pasta, Harvest
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Plum Tomatoes -- Quartered
1/4 c  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/3 c  Carrot -- Minced
1/3 c  Celery -- Minced
1/3 c  Yellow Onion -- Minced
1 lg Garlic Clove -- Minced
1/2 tb Fresh Oregano -- Minced
1 tb Fresh Parsley -- Minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Red Pepper Flakes --
Optional
1/8 ts Sugar -- Optional
To make sauce, put quartered tomatoes in a heavy, medium saucepan.
Cover and simmer over moderate heat until tomatoes have collapsed and
rendered their juices, about 15 minutes, uncovering and stirring once
or twice to make sure they are not sticking to the pan bottom.
Uncover, adjust heat to maintain a slow simmer and cook, stirring
occasionally, until tomatoes have reduced to a thick, sauce like
consistency, about 45 minutes. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill
placed over a bowl to remove skins and seeds. You should have about 2
cups puree.

Heat olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over moderately low heat. Add
carrot, celery, onion, garlic, oregano and parsley. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until vegetables are soft and sweet, about 30 minutes.
Add tomato puree. Stir to blend. Season with salt and, if desired,
hot red pepper flakes and sugar if the tomatoes seem too tart. Cover
and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes to blend flavors. Taste and
adjust seasoning. You should have about 2 cups sauce.
