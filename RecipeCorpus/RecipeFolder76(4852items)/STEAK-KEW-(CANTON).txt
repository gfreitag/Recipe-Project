Here's a nice, non-weird, Chinese recipe for Steak Kew with
variations for hoisin sauce, oyster sauce and hot bean paste. Combine
beef, onion, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, soy, pepper, cornstarch,
garlic and ginger. Let stand for 15 minutes.  Blanch snow peas,
broccoli or asparagus for 1 to 2 minutes; drain and place on heated
platter; keep warm. If using tomatoes, have at room temperature. Heat
peanut oil in a wok or skillet and stir-fry meat and onion mixture
for 1 to 2 minutes; meat should be well seared but still pink inside.

Immediately pour over blanched vegetable and serve. Or place on heated
platter and surround with tomato wedges

Variation with oyster sauce:  Omit hoisin sauce and sesame oil and
add one tablespoon oyster sauce.

Variation with hot bean paste:  Omit hoisin sauce and add 2 teaspoons
hot been paste.
