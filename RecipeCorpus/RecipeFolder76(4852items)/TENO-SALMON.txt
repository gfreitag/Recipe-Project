Title: TENO SALMON
Categories: Fish, Lapp
Yield: 1 Serving
3/4 lb Salmon, per person
Water, butter, salt
Cross cut 1-inch slices from the salmon.  I prefer slices about the
size of my palm but also smaller ones will do. Use toothpicks to bind
them into round cutlets.

Pour about 1/4 inch water into a frying pan and bring it to a boil.
Add cutlets and simmer until the water has evaporated. Turn cutlets
once during cooking.

Add butter, fry lightly on both sides.  Add salt to taste and remove
toothpicks.

Serve with boiled or mashed potatoes and sliced lemon. (Lemon is not
traditional, but...)

NOTES:

*  Traditional salmon dish from Lappland -- This is the traditional
way to prepare salmon on the river Teno (the northern border river
between Norway and Finland).

: Difficulty:  very easy.
: Time:  5 minutes to prepare, 20 minutes to cook.
: Precision:  don't let water cover the cutlets.
