The author describes this as "a piquant, almost spicy dressing that is
equally good used hot over greens or at room temperature over mixed
lettuces."

In a skillet, heat oil.  Add garlic and scallion; saute until
softened. Add broth and boil until the liquid is reduced by half -
about 3 or 4 minutes. Stir in vinegar; cook an additional 2 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl. Add ginger and tarragon. Gradually whisk in the
olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Yield:  Dresses a salad for 4 to 6.
