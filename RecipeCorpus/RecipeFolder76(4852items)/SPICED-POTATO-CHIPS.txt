Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 lb Russet potatoes *
1 qt Ice water
1 tb Salt
1/4 ts Cayenne
3/4 ts Ground cumin seed
Vegetable oil
*  scrubbed, sliced in paper-thin rounds

Soak the potatoes in the water mixed with 2 teaspoons of the salt for
10 minutes. Drain and dry thoroughly. Mix the remaining salt with the
cayenne and cumin. Fill a heavy saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of oil.
Heat to 375 degrees F. (At this temperature a cube of bread dropped
into the oil will sizzle immediately on contact.)

Add the potatoes in batches and fry until lightly browned. Remove and
drain on paper towels.

Just before serving, reheat the oil to 375 degrees F. Add the
potatoes in batches and fry until crisp. Drain on paper towels, then
season with the salt mixture.
