1 c  White Chinese turnip,

1 c  White Chinese celery,

1/2 c  Cloud Ear dried fungus,

1/2 c  Dried lily flowers, soaked
-and hard tips removed
2 oz Bean thread noodles, soaked
1 ts Salt (to taste)
About 6 to 8 T peanut oil for stir-frying PREPARATION: Shred in 2"
lengths: carrots, turnip, Chinese celery and beancurd. Shred onions,
greens & all, into 2" lengths. Rinse, then soak in hot water: enough
mushrooms, fungus and lily flowers to give specified amounts. Shred
mushrooms, chop fungus. Soak bean thread noodles.  Bean thread
noodles are important because they soak up excess moisture from the
vegetables. Vegetables should be moist but not soggy or watery after
stir-frying. STIR-FRYING: Stir-fry fresh vegetables separately with
about 1 tablespoon oil for each, in hot wok. Add salt to taste.
Drain off excess water, reserve. (Soybean sprouts should be cooked
until they are slightly charred for fullest flavor.) To stir-fry
dried soaked ingredients, begin with hot wok, add 2 to 3 tablespoons
oil, then add mushroom, fungus & lily flowers. Stir-fry green onions,
add all other ingredients to them, including noodles. Allow dish to
cool before serving. NOTE:  Fresh or canned bamboo shoot may be
substituted for any vegetable. Seaweed may be used instead of some of
the fungus.
