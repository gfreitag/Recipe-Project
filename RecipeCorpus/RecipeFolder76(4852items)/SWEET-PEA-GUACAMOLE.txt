Title: SWEET PEA GUACAMOLE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 8 Servings
10 oz Frozen peas (not tiny ones)
1    JalapeÂ¤o pepper
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
2 ts Fresh lemon juice
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Salt
1-inch square of red onion
Cook peas according to package instructions.  For this recipe, the
larger peas work better than the tiny peas. Drain cooked peas and pat
with paper towelling to remove as much water as possible. If you want
less "heat" in the guacamole, seed the pepper and discard the seeds.
Mince the pepper in a food processor or blender. Add oil and 1 1/2
teaspoons lemon juice, and let machine run until the pepper is more
finely minced. Add peas, cumin, and salt, and puree about 2 minutes,
stopping several times to scrape down the sides of the container.
Transfer the puree to a small bowl. Cut the onion into a small dice
and add to the mixture. Adjust the seasoning with additional lemon
juice or salt if necessary. Cover tightly and chill thoroughly up to
2 days before serving.
