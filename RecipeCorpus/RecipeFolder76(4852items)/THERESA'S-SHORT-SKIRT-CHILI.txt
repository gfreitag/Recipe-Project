Title: THERESA'S SHORT-SKIRT CHILI
Categories: Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Beef skirt; (tenderized, if
1/4 c  Honey
1/4 c  Soy sauce
4 cn Green chilies; (4-oz each)
3    Tomatoes
1 lg Onion; white
6    Dried chili anchos
2    Cl Garlic
2 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Oregano; (mexican)
1 ts Paprika
Recipe by: Wayne Preston Allen Cut the stems from the anchos, and
remove seeds. Cover with boiling water and let sit for an hour. Blend
in blender with the garlic until smooth.

Slightly warm the honey and mix in the soy sauce. Coat beef skirt
with meat tenderizer (if you think necessary) and honey-soy and let
sit 15 minutes. Cook beef skirt on very hot grill, basting often with
honey/soy mixture. I prefer a fairly charred result. When done
properly, this activity should remind you of watching the Kuwaiti oil
fields on CNN. Warning - this procedure produces yummy-tasting
carcinagens!

Cut beef skirt across the grain into 1/4" strips, and set aside a
little for snacking. Dice the green chilies, onion, and tomatoes. Add
the beef, vegetables, and spices to large pot. Add half the ancho
sauce and water or beer to barely cover. Add more ancho sauce over
time to suit your taste. Cook until meat is really tender, which, for
skirt, could be days. (Just kidding!)
