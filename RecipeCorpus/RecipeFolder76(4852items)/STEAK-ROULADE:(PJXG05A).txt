Title: STEAK ROULADE:(PJXG05A)
Categories: Crockpot, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Round steaks (thin)
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
3/4 c  Onion; chopped
3/4 c  Bacon; chopped
1/4 c  Water
Trim fat off steaks.  Season with salt and pepper. Mix onion and
bacon, spread over each steak.  Roll steaks (as you'd do for a jelly
roll), tie rolls tightly in several places with a string. Put steaks
into slow cooker. Add water.  Cover pot. Cook on LOW for 8 hrs. If
you want to serve this with gravy, remove meat when done, and thicken
liquid with a mixture of flour and water and cook it in pot set at
High for 15 minutes. From: Leisure Living Guide to Slow Cooking
