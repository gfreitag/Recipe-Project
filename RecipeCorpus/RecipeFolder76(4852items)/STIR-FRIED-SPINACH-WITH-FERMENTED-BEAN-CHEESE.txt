Stephen Ceideburg
2 bn Spinach
2 tb Peanut oil
2    Quarter sized slices fresh
-ginger cloves, crushed
1/4 ts Salt
1    Cube of fu ru *
1 ts Sugar
* white fermented bean curd--about 1 tablespoon

Quong Hop, the oldest bean curd factory in the United (located in
South San Francisco), produces a delicious fu ru. It is packed in
glass jars labeled "FU RU The Cultured Tufu." Once opened, store in
the refrigerator. It will keep indefinitely.

Remove and discard the tough stems from the spinach. Wash and rinse
spinach thoroughly. Remove excess water in a lettuce spinner.

Preheat a wok over medium heat and add the oil, ginger, garlic and
salt. When oil becomes fragrant, increase heat to high, add the
spinach in large handfuls, seconds apart; stir-fry until leaves are
wilted.

Mash the fu ru and mix it with the sugar. Push the spinach aside and
put the fu ru mixture in the center of the wok. Stir together over
high heat until the spinach is cooked. Serve imme- diately. Note.
Chinese water spinach may be cooked in the same manner. Prepare the
water spinach by using the leaves and only about 2 inches of the
tender hollow stems.
