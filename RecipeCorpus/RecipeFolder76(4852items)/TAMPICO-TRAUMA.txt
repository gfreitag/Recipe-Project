Title: TAMPICO TRAUMA
Categories: Boat, Drinks, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
1 oz Tequila
1 oz Bacardi Rum (151)
2 oz Amaretto
Tampico Trauma I mixed this one day and never really had a name for
it. Figured Combine stuff in a mixing glass and stir. Throw a couple
ice cubes in a "Tom and Jerry" jelly glass, pour in the trauma, a
lemon wedge for garnish and sip. ( If you want to make a big batch,
mix 1 part tequila, 1 part 151 rum to 2 parts Amaretto) WARNING: This
is Strong Shit. One glass is equivalent to six shots of good whiskey.
For a watered down version you may want to add, you guessed it water.
I prefer carbonated lemon flavored water.
