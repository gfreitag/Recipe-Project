Title: STUFFED BEAN CURD WITH PEAS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Sq fresh hard beancurd
1/2 lb Ground pork, unseasoned
1/2 c  Fresh shelled peas
2 ts Thin soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1    Clove garlic, minced
1    Green onion, minced
1/4 ts Fresh ginger juice
1/4 ts Sesame oil
Cornstarch
3 c  Frying oil
4 c  Chicken broth
Salt and pepper to taste
Cornstarch paste
Combine ground pork, soy sauce, sherry, garlic, onion, ginger juice
and sesame oil.  Cover and set aside. Slowly heat deep-frying oil in
wok; oil is hot enough when vigorous bubbles come up around a bamboo
chopstick stood vertically in oil. Deep-fry beancurd squares until
brown; drain. Cut beancurd squares in half diagonally. Use paring
knife and spoon to make hollow pocket in beancurd.  Fill pocket with
a tablespoon or so of meat mixture; dredge meat face with cornstarch.
Deep-fry each piece until face is brown and crusty; drain. Combine
chicken broth, stuffed deep-fried beancurd, whole mushrooms and peas
in clay pot. Bring to boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 10
minutes. Uncover, return to boil, and thicken soup slightly with
cornstarch paste. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve. Serves 4
