Title: SWEET POTATO PANCAKES
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Unsalted butter; melted
1/2 c  Cooked sweet potatoes
- peeled and chopped
- or roughly mashed
1    Egg
1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 c  Milk (or more)
Sour cream
PLACE SWEET POTATOES in a mixing bowl, add egg and mix well. Stir in
the flour and add the baking powder. Add up to 1/3 cup of milk,
stirring. Stir in 1 tablespoon butter. The mixture should have the
consistency of thick, lumpy sauce and be able to coat a wooden spoon.
Place a non-stick or heavy iron skillet over medium heat on top of
the stove and add 1/2 teaspoon butter. Spoon 3 tablespoons of batter
per pancake into the skillet and cook until bubbles rise to the
surface of the pancakes and break, about 1 to 2 minutes. Using a
spatula, flip the pancakes and cook another 2 minutes. Remove
pancakes from the skillet and keep warm on a covered plate in the
oven. Repeat the procedure until all the pancakes are cooked. After
the first batch is cooked, add as little butter as possible without
allowing the pancakes to stick to the bottom of the pan. Serve with
sour cream. Makes 12 small pancakes.
