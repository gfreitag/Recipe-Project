PUT GINGER, SHALLOTS AND ONION on a baking sheet; place under a hot

beef shank to a boil. Thoroughly skim and discard the scum from the
surface of the stock. Drop the charred ingredients, star anise,
cinnamon stick and cloves into pot, reduce to low heat; simmer for 2
hours. Remove the meat. Remove and shred the meat from the shank and
reserve. Return the bone to the simmering stock. Simmer 1 hour
longer. When soup is done, remove and discard bones. Strain and
degrease stock; add fish sauce and salt. Keep warm. In a separate
pot, bring 3 quarts water to a boil. Drain noodles and add to boiling
water; cook for 1 minute. Drain in a colander. Divide noodles among 8
soup bowls (about 1-to-2-cup-size bowls). Divide and top each bowl of
noodles with shredded cooked beef, the raw sirloin steak slices,
onion slices and bean sprouts. Ladle about 1 1/4 cups hot soup stock
(this will cook the beef) to cover the noodles and beef, top with
fresh coriander and green onions. Serve with squeeze of lime and
chiles.
