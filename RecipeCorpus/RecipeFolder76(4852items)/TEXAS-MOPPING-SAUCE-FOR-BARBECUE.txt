Title: TEXAS MOPPING SAUCE FOR BARBECUE
Categories: Sauces, Meats, Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Strong black coffee
1 c  Tomato catsup
1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Salt
1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/4 c  Butter or margerine
1 tb Sugar
Combine all ingredients and simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring
frequently.  Store in a tightly covered jar in refrigerator. Heat
before using.  For ribs, I dunk the ribs in the sauce each time I
turn them. This sauce is very spicy and some people think it's too
strong for poultry; I disagree.

The coarser the pepper is ground, the better it is. Warning: if this
is used on country style pork ribs it will make you throw rocks at
steak!
