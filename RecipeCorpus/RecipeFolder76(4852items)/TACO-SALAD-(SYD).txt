~------------------------------------------------------
~------------- ~-- In a large frying pan brown the ground beef. Add
the taco seasoning or salsa, whichever you prefer and simmer until
most of the liquid is cooked off.  Cut up and combine all salad
ingredients in a large salad bowl. When the salad is ready, add the
ground beef and mix well. Taco sauce or Italian salad dressing both
go very well with this one dish meal. Other salad dressings may be
used as well. From: Syd's Cookbook.
