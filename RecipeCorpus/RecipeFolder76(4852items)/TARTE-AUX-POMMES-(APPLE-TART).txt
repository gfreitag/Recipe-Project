Title: TARTE AUX POMMES (APPLE TART)
Categories: Tarts, Fruits
Yield: 1 Tart
350 g  Rough Puff Pastry
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 kg Apples; Golden Delicious
- or Granny Smith
3 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Butter; unsalted
50 g  Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2    Eggs
100 g  Sugar
6 tb Butter; unsalted, melted
1 ts Vanilla extract
(350 g = 12.5 ounces; 1 kg = 2 pounds; 50 g = 1 3/4 ounces)

On a lightly floured surface, carefully roll out the dough to a
12-inch (30 cm) circle.

Transfer the dough to a 10 1/2-inch (27 cm) black tin tart pan with a
removable bottom.

Carefully press the pastry into the pan and up the sides, trying not
to stretch it.

Trim the overhang, leaving about a 1-inch (2.5 cm) extending over the
rim.

Tuck this overhang inside the pan, pressing gently against the side to
create a sturdy, double-sided shell.

(If you build the pastry a bit higher than the height of the pan, you
will have less problem with shrinkage)

Chill for at least 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 oF (190 oC).

Prick the bottom of the shell with the tines of a fork. Carefully
line the shell loosely with heavy-duty foil, pressing well into the
edges so the pastry does not shrink while baking.

Fill with pie weights, or dry rice or beans - making sure you get all
the way into the edges - to prevent shrinkage.

Bake just until the pastry begins to brown around the edges and seems
firm enough to stand up by itself (about 20 minutes).

Meanwhile, peel and core the apples. Cut each apple into 12 even
wedges. Toss them in a bowl with the lemon juice to prevent
discoloration.

In a Iarge skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the
apples, sprinkle on the sugar, and saute, shaking the pan from time
to time so the apples cook evenly.

Cook until lightly browned on all sides (about 15 minutes.)

While the apples cook, prepare the topping: beat the eggs and sugar
thoroughly until thick and pale. Add the melted butter and vanilla and
continue mixing at high speed until the ingredients are thoroughly
incorporated.

Spoon the apples into the center of the prepared pastry shell,
arranging them carefully. Pour the topping over the apples.

Bake until golden, about 30 minutes.
