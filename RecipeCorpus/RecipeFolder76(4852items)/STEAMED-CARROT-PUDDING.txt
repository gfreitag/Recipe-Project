MMMMM---------------------SAUCE INGREDIENTS--------------------------

1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Lemon extract
1/8 ts Cornstarch, well-divided
1 tb Butter
MAKE PUDDING:  Mix the dry ingredients and set them aside. Grease
completely three large (25-oz) tin cans, such as the kind used for
tomato puree.  Do NOT use the plastic-lined variety. Alternatively,
grease one large steaming mold, with a hole in the center. Or
improvise.

Add the potatoes.  Mix well.  Then, in turn, add the baking soda, the
carrots, the bread crumbs and the Crisco, making sure that you mix
well after adding each ingredient. This matters, so do it! You may
have to get some help from King Kong to blend adequately after adding
the shortening.

Add, in sequence, the brown sugar, the beaten egg, the lemon extract
and the vanilla, mixing well after each addition. Now, add the dry
ingredients mixture, a bit at a time. The mixture will be extremely
thick and very difficult to mix.  Add the walnuts and the raisins.
Mix them in. Go ahead. You're strong enough.

Push the mixture into the tins, with each about 3/4 full, or a little
more. Seal the tins with aluminum foil and use a rubber band to hold
the foil on (the pudding should not be exposed directly to the
steam). Steam 1 1/2 to 2 hours, (until the pudding seems uniform. You
can't overcook it, so err on the long side, please!) and cool if
you're not going to serve it right now.

Make the sauce by combining all of the sauce ingredients in a small
saucepan and heating until it bubbles and all ingredients are
dissolved. To serve, reheat by steaming for at least 45 minutes, or
serve out of the original pot.

NOTES:

*  An old Welsh steamed carrot pudding -- This is a good steamed
pudding, despite the list of ingredients that are "good for you". The
sauce (following the recipe) is not a necessity for good taste, only
for authenticity, although I LIKE it with the sauce. Some add rum to
this sauce.  Suit yourself.  I like it both ways.

This is a very old recipe, I gathered it from my grandmother, who
would have been 101 (sniff) this year, who learned it from her Welsh
mother, who learned it from her... (in Wales), ergo it's at least
200+. Given its similarity to some late Medieval puddings, one might
suspect that its origins are much earlier. I determined the
quantities listed here by measuring what my grandmother tossed into
the pot. Yield: makes about 5 pounds.

*  This stuff keeps in the fridge nearly forever (at least a month)
as long as you don't let it dry out.

*  Decant or spoon out (depends on if you want to be fancy or not) and
serve with sauce. Then, don't eat for two days to make up for the
calories.

Difficulty:  moderate (considerable physical work required); Time: 1
hour preparation, 3 hours steaming; Precision: no need to measure.
