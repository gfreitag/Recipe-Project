Title: SPICY BEANSPROUTS WITH VERMICELLI
Categories: Pasta, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
3    Spring onions; sliced
2 tb Dark sesame oil
1 ts Garam masala
1    Garlic clove; crushed
100 g  Beansprouts
150 g  Vermicelli
1 tb Chopped coriander
So quick to make, this dish has all the qualities of classic Eastern
cookery. Chopped coriander, sprinkled over it just before serving, is
the finishing touch.

Soften the spring onions in the oil for a few minutes and then add the
garam masala and garlic. Stir for another minute or so and then toss
in the beansprouts and stir-fry for another 3-4 minutes until heated
through, tender but still crisp. Cook and drain the vermicelli and
add to the pan, stirring until well mixed and hot. Serve in a warm
dish, sprinkled with the fresh chopped coriander.
