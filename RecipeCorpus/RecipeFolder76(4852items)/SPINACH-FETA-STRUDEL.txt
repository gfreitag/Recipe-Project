Spinach Feta Strudel

Remove packages of strudel leaves from the refigerator at least 3
hours before using.  Wash the spinach in several changes of water.
Dry it and cut into 2-inch lengths. Cook it in oil till wilted.
Drain. Brown the onions in butter. Mix the onions, eggs, scallions,
cheese, dill and parsley. Add the spinach and season with salt and
pepper. Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter two 8 X 8 X 2-inch pans. Cut 2
strudel leaves into 6 squares each by cutting into thirds lengthwise
and in half across (keep the remaining strudel leaves covered to
prevent drying). Place 1 of the squares in the prepared pan and brush
with melted butter. Repeat with the remaining 11 strudel sqaures,
placing each on top of the last. Spread with half of the
spinach-cheese filling and cover with 12 more strudel sqaures,
brushing each with butter. Repeat the process with the remaining
ingredients for a second pan. With a sharp knife, cut through the top
to mark it into 2-inch squares.  Bake 1 hour or till brown and very
puffy. Cut into squares and serve hot.
