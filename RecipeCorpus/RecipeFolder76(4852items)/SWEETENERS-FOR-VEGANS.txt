"SWEETENERS

The amount of sweetener called for in a recipe may be altered to
suit your own taste. if you like less sweetener, add less. A recipe
can be made sweetener by reducing the amount of flour by about
1/4-1/2 cup and adding the same amount of granulated or powdered
sweetener. Maple syrup or other sweetener may be substituted for
honey in most recipes from other books.
Fruit concentrates may be used in place of honey or maple syrup, in
about equal proportions.
Regular fruit juice may be used as a sole sweetening agent in some
recipes, with small variations in flavour. For example, if a recipe
calls for 2 cups maple syrup and 1 1/2 cups nut milk, use 3 1/2 cups
of a thick variety of peach or pear juice (other fruit juices are not
sweet or as light coloured.) There will be a slight change in
flavour. If a recipe using only fruit juice is not sweet enough,
substitute 1/2 cup or so of one of the recipe's dry ingredients (like
flour) with the same amount of natural powdered or granulated
sweetener.
When a recipe calls for a liquid sweetener, it is best to use maple
syrup, fruit concentrate or natural liquid sweetener for the best
flavour. if any other liquid sweeteners are used, the amount of
sweetening must be increased. Some sweeteners, like molasses or
sorghum, can greatly change the flavour of the recipe and must be
experimented with."
