MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2/3 c  Stock
1 ts Dry sherry
1/4 c  Milk
Preparation:  Wash cauliflower, and cut florets about twice the size
of straw mushrooms.  Dice green onions into 1/4" pieces. Mix stock &
sherry.

Cooking:  Heat first oil to medium hot.  Add garlic & stir for about
30 seconds.  Remove garlic before it begins to brown. Turn heat high;
add cauliflower. Stir-fry for about 1 minute. Add onion, salt &
sugar; stir- fry 30 seconds.  Stir in Tientsin cabbage.  If desired,
add shrimp or crab meat.

Immediately add stock & sherry; bring sauce to boil, mixing with
cauliflower.  Cover & simmer 4 minutes. Remove lid; thicken with
cornstarch.  Sauce should be very heavy, so that when milk is added,
it will thin slightly, but still have body. Bring sauce back to boil;
slowly add milk while stirring. Add remaining peanut oil for a final
glaze. Serve.
