Categories: Fruits/nuts, Pies, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
1    No-Roll Tart Shell
-(See RECIPE)
MMMMM-------------------------LIME CURD------------------------------
1/3 c  Strained lime juice
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
1/3 c  Sugar
4    Egg yolks
2 pt Strawberries
- rinsed, hulled and sliced
Confectioners' sugar
- for finishing
PREPARE AND REFRIGERATE tart shell. FOR THE LIME CURD: COMBINE THE
LIME JUICE, butter and sugar in a heavy, non-reactive pan. Place over
low heat and bring to a boil over low heat. Meanwhile, whisk the
yolks in a bowl until liquid. When the lime mixture boils, whisk half
of it into the yolks. Return the remaining lime mixture to a boil and
whisk in the yolk mixture. Whisk constantly until the mixture
thickens and begins to simmer around the edge of the pan, about 2
minutes. Pour the lime curd into a non-reactive bowl, press plastic
wrap against the surface and refrigerate up to 1 week. TO BAKE THE
TART SHELL: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F and set a rack in the middle
level. Pierce the dough with a fork at 1-inch intervals. Cut a
14-inch disk of parchment or wax paper and line the dough with it,
making sure it fits flat against the side of the tart shell. Fill
with dried beans or pie weights and bake about 20 minutes, until the
dough appears dull and dry when a corner of the paper is lifted.
Remove the tart shell from the oven, remove the paper containing the
weights, and return the shell to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes longer,
until it is lightly colored. Do not overbake or the shell will be dry
and tough. Cool on a rack. TO ASSEMBLE THE TART: SPREAD THE LIME CURD
evenly in the tart shell. Arrange the strawberry slices, overlapping,
in concentric or straight rows on the lime curd. Sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar immediately before serving.
