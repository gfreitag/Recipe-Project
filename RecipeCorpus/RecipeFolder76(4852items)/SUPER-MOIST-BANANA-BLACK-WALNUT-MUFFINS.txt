Title: SUPER MOIST BANANA BLACK WALNUT MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins
Yield: 8 Muffins
1 3/4 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
2 1/4 ts BAKING POWDER
1/2 ts SALT
2/3 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
1/2 c  BUTTER
1/4 ts PURE VANILLA EXTRACT
1/4 c  HONEY
1 ts ORANGE ZEST
2 lg EGGS
4 md BANANAS, over-ripe (BLACK),
-mashed
1/3 c  BLACK WALNUTS, coarsely
-chopped
Preheat the oven to 350-degrees.

Grease (or spray with PAM), 8 LARGE muffin cups. I put 6 in one and 2
in the other; set aside.

Sift together into a bowl the flour, baking powder (or baking
soda--mine turned out great) and salt; set aside.

In another bowl, cream the butter, sugar, vanilla and honey and add
the orange zest. Beat in the eggs and bananas. Gradually add the
sifted ingredients to the banana mixture. Fold in the nuts. Divide
the batter among the 8 muffin cups, they should be about 2/3 full.

Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a cake tester (or toothpick)
inserted in the center comes out clean. I checked mine at 25 minutes
and noticed they were browning on top too much, but they were still
runny in the middle. I covered the pans with aluminum foil and baked
for 5 more minutes, they were done.

Turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.
