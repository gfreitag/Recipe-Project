Bill Maxwell, former Texas restaurateur, originally claimed his
chicken-fried steak was the "best found south of the Rio Brazos."
Subsequent chicken-fried steak contests proved him truthful, so he
extended his claim to include all lands south of the Arkansas River.
In another conversation with Bill, we found his "boundary" had crept
north to Omaha, Nebraska. Well, eventually he's gonna have to stop at
the North Pole ... we hope.

Sprinkle salt, pepper and garlic salt on both sides of tenderized
steak to taste. Put steak onto a tray that is well-covered with
flour. Then "pound the hell out of it (the steak) with stiff fingers,
working from the center out, until it reaches the size of an L.P.
record." (That's those things they used to make before compact
discs). Flip several times and repeat pounding. Mix eggs, beer, 1
teaspoon salt and Adolph's meat tenderizer in a shallow bowl. Add
enough flour to make a thin, watery batter. Beat mixture smooth. Dip
meat into batter. "Flop" back onto flour tray and cover with four.
Pound again with fingertips until moisture is absorbed. Cook in deep
fat at 350 degrees until golden brown. Serve with French fries and
cover with white gravy.
