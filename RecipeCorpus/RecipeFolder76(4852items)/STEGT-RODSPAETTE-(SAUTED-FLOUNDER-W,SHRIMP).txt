"Plaice is the fish the Danes usually prepare in this manner, but
flounder is an excellent American substitute. Danish shrimp are the
1" variety similar to U.S. West Coast shrimp. Choose the smallest
fresh shrimp available." Rince the fish in cold water and pat dry
with paper towels. Salt lightly, dip in flour and shake off excess.
Spread the bread crumbs on wax paper. In a mixing bowl beat the eggs
together with 2 tablespoons of water, then dip each fillet into the
egg mixture and coat each side thoroughly with the bread crumbs. Let
them rest for at least 10 minutes before cooking. Heat 2 tablespoons
of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy 10-12" skillet over
moderate heat. Add the shrimp and toss them in the butter for 2 to 3
minutes until well coated. Place a line of the shrimp down the center
of each fillet. Melt the remaining butter over low heat until it
turns a rich, nutty brown, pour over the fish fillets and garnish
with lemon wedges. If you prefer, serve with a parsley sauce (see
recipe) in place of the shrimp and brown butter.
