Title: SWEET LITTLE THINGS
Categories: Appetizers, Desserts
Yield: 16 Servings
2 cn Crescent Rolls (canned)
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla (to taste)
Juice of 1 lemon
8 oz Cream cheese
Mix all except rolls together in bowl. Seperate rolls, and roll them
out thinner (like pie crust). Place 2 - 3 TB of filling in middle of
long edge. Fold corners up and roll up remaining flap. Bake at 350F
until brown (10-12 minutes).  These are quick, easy and great for
unexpected company. They look better if you use clear vanilla.
