Title: SUFFOLK CAKES(ENGLISH)
Categories: Cakes, English
Yield: 1 Cake
2 oz Butter
2    Eggs
4 oz Caster sugar
Finely grated rind of
-a small lemon
2 oz Self-raising flour
Set oven to 400/F or Mark 6. Warm the butter in a saucepan until it
is just liquid. Separate the eggs and whisk the whites until they
stand in soft peaks. Beat the yolks, add the sugar and lemon rind,
then fold in the egg whites. Stir the butter and flour into the egg
mixture and beat well. Divide the mixture evenly between paper bun
cases that have been set in a bun tin (the mixture is somewhat slack,
so placing the paper cases in a bun tin gives them extra support) and
bake for about 15 minutes or until the cakes are golden and springy
to the touch. As the cakes cool, their tops will flatten.
