Title: TEXAS-STYLE BRISKET
Categories: Outdoor, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
Beef brisket (3-5 lbs)
1 pk Lipton Onion Soup Mix
1 cn (10.5 oz.) beef broth
1    Onion, finely chopped
Crushed red pepper to taste
Start charcoal for indirect method cooking (see note). Trim the fat
off the brisket. Rub contents of onion soup onto both sides of beef
and wrap tightly with three sheets of tin foil turning the wrap 90
degrees after each wrapping. This will help keep the juices from
seeping out. When coals are white hot throw the brisket on. Cover and
cook for about 2 hours; turning it over after one hour. Add more
charcoal as necessary. Remove from grill and carefully open package
without spilling juices. Return meat to grill for about 10-15 minutes
(cover with lid).  Meanwhile, mix drippings with the can of broth and
onion. Bring to a boil to reduce the liquid. When cooking time is up
for brisket remove juice from heat and pour into a serving bowl. Add
crushed red pepper to taste.

Note:  Do not place hot coals directly under meat; rather, place some
in front and some behind.  Use about 16 coals or less at one time.
Remember to cook slow.
