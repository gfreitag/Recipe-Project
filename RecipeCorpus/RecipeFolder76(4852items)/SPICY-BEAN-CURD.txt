A fiery sauce coats cubes of delicate tofu in this succulent
stir-fry. To balance it's zestiness and soothe your palate, serve
with hot cooked rice. Cut tofu into 1/2 inch cubes; place in a
colander and let drain for 15 minutes.  In a bowl, blend the 1 tsp
soy, sherry, and sweet bean sauce; add pork and stir to coat. Stir in
1 tsp of the oil; let stand for 15 minutes. Heat a wok or wide frying
pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add remaining oil.  When oil
begins to heat, add ginger and garlic. Stir once, then add pork and
stir-fry until meat is no longer pink (about 2 minutes). Stir in hot
bean sauce.  Add tofu, the 3/4 cup of water, and the 2 Tbs soy. Cook
for 3 minutes; then add onions. Stir together the water and
cornstarch; pour into pan and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and
thickens.  Makes 2 to 3 servings.
