Title: TANDOORI PASTE
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Nonfat yogurt (active
Cultures are good)
Several cloves garlic
Several pieces chopped fresh
Ginger
Few chopped hot green
Chilies (seeds or not is up
To you)
Turmeric
Cayenne pepper or paprika
Garam masala
In a blender:

I've been unspecific with the measures, because the balance of spices
in this is kind of up to the cook...there are probably other
ingredients besides these in the commercial tandoori paste, but these
are the essentials as I remember them.

Anyway, to prepare the food, marinate whatever you'll be cooking in a
mixture of lemon juice and salt for about 1/2 hr. Then add the lemon
juice/salt to the stuff in the blender and whirl it up. When you lean
over to sniff it should bite back, hard. Pour the tandoori paste over
the food, let it sit for up to two hours. Then (for eggplant slices,
for example) toss on the grill still lightly coated with the tandoori
mixture (messy) OR for something big like a head of cauliflower, wrap
in tinfoil, slathering a lot of the paste over the top before closing
it up. Bake until it's almost done, and then open the tinfoil to let
it dry out a bit while it finishes baking.

If you want really bright red, mix some red and yellow food coloring
and paint it onto the food during the lemon and salt phase.
