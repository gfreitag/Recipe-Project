Title: SPROUTING RAMEN SALAD (CHOPSTIX)
Categories: Salad
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Chinese noodles
2 c  Bean sprouts
2 oz Daikon radish sprouts
3 oz Alfalfa sprouts
3 tb Sesame seeds
DRESSING --
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
2 tb Dark soy sauce
2 tb Sesame oil
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 ts Chinese red chili sauce
1/3 c  Minced green onion
2 tb Fresh ginger root -- minced
Bring 6 quarts of water to a rapid boil and add the noodles. When
noodles are still firm but no longer raw tasting in the center, tip
the noodles into a colander. Rinse under cold water and drain
thoroughly.

Pull alfalfa sprouts apart. Put spouts aside.

In a small ungreased skillet placed over high heat, toast the sesame
seeds until golden, about 4 minutes, immediately tip out and set
aside.

Combine the dressing ingredients and mix well.  Toss the noodles with
the dressing and refrigerate to chill well.

Toss noodles with sprouts. Turn out onto serving plates, sprinkle with
seeds and serve 3 entrees or 4 to 6 salads.
