A few extra chillies would give this salad a lot more punch. This Thai
recipe transforms the familiar leftovers into a thoroughly Asian salad
perfect for hot days.

Finely shred 1/2 a Chinese cabbage.  Grate two carrots. Cut 1
capsicum into thin strips.  Shred 300 g cooked chicken meat and
finely slice 100 g ham.

Make a dressing by combining:

1 birdseye chilli, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic crushed 2
tablespoons lime (or lemon), juice 2 tablespoons dark soya sauce 1/2
cup of flaked almonds, lightly toasted

Bring a large pot of water to the boil and have ready a sink full of
icey-cold water.  Plunge the shredded cabbage into the boiling water
for one minute then scoop it out and into the cold water.

Drain and dry the cabbage and arrange it and the other vegetables in
sections or concentric rings for maximum decorative value on a large
serving dish.  Fill the centre of the arrangement with chicken and
ham.

Decorate the dish with bright red chilli "flowers" (optional). Pass
the dressing separately.

Makes 4 servings.

[The chilli "flowers" can be easily made by slitting long, thin, hot
chillies lengthwise from near where the stem attaches and then
tossing the slit chillies into a bowl of ice water and ice cubes. The
"petals" will curl back and make an attractive garnish.  Make about
eight slits. S.C.]
