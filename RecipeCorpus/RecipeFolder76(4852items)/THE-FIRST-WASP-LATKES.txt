Title: THE FIRST WASP LATKES
Categories: Breakfast/b, Potatoes, Side dishes, Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lg Russet potatoes, peeled --
Aprox  2 pounds OR
8 sm Russet potatoes, peeled
2 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper -- to taste
Grate the potatoes onto a large clean kitchen towel that can be
stained. Roll the potatoes up in the towel and wring to remove
moisture. (It is best to do this over the sink, since it will produce
a suprising amount of liquid). Melt the butter with the olive oil on
a large griddle. Form the grated potatoes into 4 pancakes. Cook the
pancakes over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until bottom is
golden brown, then flip the pancakes. Cook on the other side for
about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve plain or with
sour cream and applesauce.
