Fat grams    per serving:
least 30 minutes before baking, preheat your pizza stone or oven
tiles to 450 degrees. Flatten the dough and form into a ball by
folding the left side two thirds over onto the right side. Flatten
the dough, pushing from right to left. Turn a quarter turn and
repeat. Repeat this rapidly until you have a cushion of dough smooth
on the bottom. Now turn the dough "smooth side up" and rotate the
dough between your hands while tucking the dough under itself. This
will increase the tension on the top of the dough and make a nice
ball shape. Flatten the dough into a disk using a floured rolling
pin. When the dough resists, allow it to rest a few minutes covered
loosely with a towel or floured plastic wrap. Repeat this until you
have a circle with a 14 to 16 inch diameter. If the dough is at all
sticky, flour both sides heavily. Sprinkle your piel with cornmeal.
Roll the dough up on your rolling pin and transfer to the piel.
Adjust the dough as needed and quickly assemble the pizza. Brush the
surface lightly with olive oil. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over
the surface leaving a 1/2 inch boarder. Garnish the surface with the
mixed cheeses, add the herbs and drizzle the olive oil over the
surface. Add salt & Pepper and finish with a sprinkling of Parmesan.
Open the oven door, position the piel at the back of the stone or
tiles and give the piel a few quick jerks to make sure the pizza is
loose and will slide!! Pull the piel back and the pizza will slide
onto the stone. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. The cheese should be
bubbling and the edges should be browning lightly.
