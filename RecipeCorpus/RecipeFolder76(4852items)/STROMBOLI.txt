Title: STROMBOLI
Categories: Italian, Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 pk Yeast
2 ts Sugar
1/3 c  ;Water, warm
4 c  Flour
3 tb Butter; in pieces
1 ts Salt
1 c  ;Water, ice, without cubes
1 lb Ricotta
1/2 c  Parmesan
1/2 lb Mozzarella, sliced
1/2 lb Pepperoni
2 tb Butter; melted
Sesame seeds
Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off. Combine
yeast, sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl. Set aside for 5
minutes until foamy.  In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour,
butter pieces and salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to
yeast. With the processor running, add yeast-water mixture gradually,
until all of the moisture is absorbed and the dough leaves the side
of the bowl. Process for an additional 60 seconds. Transfer dough
from the workbowl to a large greased mixing bowl. Cover with a
kitchen towel and place in warm off oven. Allow to rise until
doubled, approximately 1 1/2 hours.

Combine the ricotta and Parmesan. Punch down the risen dough and
transfer to a floured rolling surface. With quick, hard strokes, roll
dough into a large rectangle, approximately 1/2 inch thick. Layer
one- half of the mozzarella cheese evenly down the center leaving
approximately three inches of exposed dough on either side. Top with
the ricotta mixture and pepperoni, and the remaining mozzarella.
Overlap the exposed dough over the cheese mixture and pinch well on
all sides to seal.

Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen
towel and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled,
approximately 45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle
with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until
loaf is well browned and hollow sounding when thumped.
