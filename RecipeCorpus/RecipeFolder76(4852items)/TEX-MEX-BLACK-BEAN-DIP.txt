MMMMM-----------------ANNE STEIRER, 214-243-8123----------------------
30 oz Canned black beans; drained
1 ts Oil
1/2 c  Onions, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/2 c  Tomatoes; diced
1/3 c  Picante sauce; mild
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
1/2 ts Chili powder
1 oz Monterey Jack, shredded
1/4 c  Cilantro, fresh
1 tb Lime juice
Dip and chips -- yum!  This is a bit thicker than a dip. Easy to make
in quantity for a big party or to pack in small glass containers for
gifts. Must be refrigerated.

Place beans in bowl and partially mash until chunky. Set aside.

Heat oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and
garlic; saute 4 minutes or until tender. Add beans, tomato, and next
3 ingredients; cook 5 minutes, or until thickened, stirring
constantly. Remove from heat; add cheese and remaining ingredients,
stirring until cheese melts. Serve warm or at room temperature, with
fat-free corn or flour tortilla chips or cut-up veggies.

Makes about 2-1/2 cups.  Recipe may be multiplied.

When made with reduced-fat cheese: 1 tb = 21 cal, 1.3 gm fat.

Presented by Anne Steirer at a "Healthy Holiday Gifts" seminar on
Oct. 24, 1995.

Sylvia's comments: she served this on Baked Tostitos and it was quite
good, not dry-tasting.
