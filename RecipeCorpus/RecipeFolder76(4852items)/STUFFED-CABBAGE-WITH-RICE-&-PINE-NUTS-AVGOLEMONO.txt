2 md Cabbage heads
3 tb Clarified butter
1 md Onion; chopped fine
1 c  Water
1 c  Raw long grain rice
1/4 c  Raisins or currants
1/2 c  Pine nuts
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
Salt & freshly ground pepper
3    Eggs
1    Lemon, juice only
2 tb Butter; cut into bits
Plunge cabbages into boiling salted water and cook about 8 minutes,
then drain thoroughly and set aside while you prepare the filling. In
a heavy skillet heat the clarified butter, add the chopped onions and
cook until soft and transparent.  Add the water and bring to a boil,
then add the rice and stir.  Lower the heat and simmer gently until
the rice has absorbed the liquid, approximately 15 minutes.  Remove
from heat and add the raisins or currants, pine nuts, parsley, dill
and season with salt and pepper. Cool. Separate 2 of the eggs and mix
the egg whites into filling. Reserve the yolks for the avgolemono.
Stuff and roll the cabbage leaves, using one heaping tablespoon
filling, roll up snugly, then place, seam side down, in a casserole.
Dot with butter and add water to cover, then cover cabbage rolls with
an inverted plate and cover casserole. Simmer for approximately 1
hour, then transfer to a warm serving dish and keep warm. Strain the
remaining liquid for the avgolemono sauce. Beat the remaining eggs
and yolks for 2 minutes. Continuing to beat, gradually add the lemon
juice. Then add the 1-1/2 cups cooking liquid by droplets, beating
steadily, until all has been added. Cook over hot water, not boiling,
stirring constantly until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon.
Pour over the cabbage rolls and serve hot. From: "The Food of Greece"
