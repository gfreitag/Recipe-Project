Title: SYD'S TURKEY GRAVY
Categories: Poultry, Sauces
Yield: 16 Servings
Turkey giblets
Water, cold
1 ts Salt
2 c  Turkey drippings
1/2 c  Flour
Assuming you are going to roast a turkey in the oven, it will be in a
roasting pan of some kind.  I am also assuming this turkey had
giblets (you know, liver, heart, gizzard and neck). While the turkey
is roasting, put the giblets in a pretty large pot with lots of water
and a little salt. Bring them to a boil and let 'em simmer. No length
of time - just till they are done.

After you remove the turkey from the roaster, there should be lots of
juices in there that have accumulated during roasting.
I pour them out into something and skim the fat off (or use one of
those fat skimming cups or brushes). Then, put the de-fatted
drippings back into the pan. Add some of the liquid from cooking the
giblets if needed to make 2 c.  Whisk flour into it, and simmer while
it thickens.

Scrape up all of the "goodies" from the bottom of the pan to make the
gravy extra-flavorful. If it gets too thick, you can add more liquid.
If it isn't thick enough, add more flour and continue to whisk it, to
keep out most of the lumps. You can chop up the giblets, finely and
add them to the gravy as it is almost done - just to heat them
through.

If you have to add something because the color is not what you would
like, a dash of Kitchen Bouquet will do it - not much.
