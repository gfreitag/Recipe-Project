Title: STUFFED SHRIMP WITH BACON
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 2 Servings
12 lg Shrimp (the
-larger the better)
1 lb Mozzarella
-(low-moisture)
1 lb Bacon (as little
-fat as possible)
Steam shrimp lightly, just about 30-60 seconds after they begin to
turn orange.  Plunge shrimp into ice water to cool. Do this
immediately. Peel and butterfly the shrimp.

Cut the mozzarella into strips that are a little smaller than the
shrimp. Put mozzarella in shrimp and (this is important) roll shrimp
from tail to head while it is open (butterflied). This keeps the
cheese from leaking.

Wrap shrimp-cheese roll in 1/2 slice of bacon and put on skewer. Cook
on grill or barbecue, over moderate heat, until bacon looks done.

When shrimp are butterflied, cut them almost all the way through so
they can lay flat when open. This makes them easier to roll. The fire
will flare up due to bacon fat. Turn the skewers often to cook
evenly. The bacon should be slightly charred when done. The reason
why the shrimp are cooked lightly first is that they tend to cook
slower than the bacon.
