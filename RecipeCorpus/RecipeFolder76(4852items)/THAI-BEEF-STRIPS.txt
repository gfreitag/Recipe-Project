Combine first seven ingredients to make a marinade. Then add beef
strips, cover, and let stand in refrigerator at least 2 hours before
grilling. This marinade can be made ahead of time and stored in
refrigerator.

To make the dipping sauce, combine sugar and cornstarch in a
saucepan. add the soy sauce, vinegar, and crushed red pepper. Stir
all ingredients over low heat. continue stirring and increase heat
slightly until mixture begins to bubble and thicken. Place in a
shallow bowl and set aside.

Grill beef strips on a barbeque, taking care not to overcook. On a
mesquite grill this should take only about 1/2 minute per side of
each strip. Serve with sauce.
