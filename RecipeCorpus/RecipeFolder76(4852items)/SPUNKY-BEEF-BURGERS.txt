Title: SPUNKY BEEF BURGERS
Categories: Meats, Holidays, Barbecue
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Egg
1/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
1/4 c  Salsa
4    Green onions, finely chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 tb Dijon mustard
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Dash hot pepper sauce
1 lb Lean ground beef
6    Hamburger buns
In bowl, beat egg; mix bread crumbs, salsa, onions, garlic, mustard,
Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce. Mix in beef;
shape into six 1/2 inch thick patties.

Place patties on greased grill over medium heat; cover and cook for
about 6 minutes per side or until no longer pink inside. Sandwich in
buns. Makes 6 servings. Note:  Make the Spunky Beef Burgers up to a
week ahead and freeze; allow at least 24 hours for thawing in the
refrigerator. Or make them earlier in the day, cover and refrigerate
for up to 8 hours. If only medium ground beef is available, don't
worry; the excess fat drips off during grilling.   Typed in MMFormat
