Title: SWEET INDIAN LEMON PICKLES
Categories: Indian, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
9    Lemons
4 tb Coarse or kosher salt
1 1/2 tb Cumin seeds,toasted, ground
1 tb Coarsely ground black pepper
3 c  Sugar
2 tb Seedless raisins
8    Dried, hot red peppers
This is remarkably similar to the Moroccan Salted Lemon recipe that
I'm looking for, except that it uses sugar instead of salt. Adapted
from Julie Sahni's "Classic Indian Cooking."

Wash the lemons in cold water and dry thoroughly.

Quarter 6 of the lemons from the top almost all the way through to the
bottom, leaving about 1/2 inch so they'll hold together. Squeeze the
juice from the other lemons.

Mix the salt, cumin and black pepper in a small dish, and mix
thoroughly with the lemons, Stuff the lemons into a quart jar and
pour in the lemon juice.

Cover with cheesecloth to prevent dirt from getting in the jar, and
let sit in the open for about 1 week.

On the 7th day, pour the juices from the jar into an enamel or
stainless steel pan, add the sugar and cook over low heat, stirring,
until the sugar dissolves. Add the lemons and cook, stirring gently,
for 8 minutes or so. Stir in the raisins and peppers.  Put the lemons
in a sterilized jar and seal with the lid. Let sit for a week or so
before eating. Use like you would any pickle, as an accompaniment.
