Title: TEMPURA ONION RINGS
Categories: Japanese, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Vegetable oil, for frying
1 1/2 c  Cornstarch
3    Red onions, peeled, sliced
-crosswise to 1/3-inch
Thick (about 1-1/4 lbs.)
1 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 ts Salt, plus more for sprinkl
-ing
1 1/2 c  Ice, coarsely crushed
Lemon wedges, ketchup and
- soy sauce, for serving
1.  In a deep fryer or large saucepan, heat the oil the 350F.
Meanwhile, put 1 cup of the cornstarch in a brown paper bag. Add the
onion slices and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated onion rings
to a large baking sheet.

2.  In a large bowl, mix the remaining 1/2 cup cornstarch with the
flour and 1 teaspoon salt.  Add 1-1/2 cups of cold water all at once
into the flour mixture. Stir vigorously with chopsticks or a fork to
be pieces of ice and lumps the size of a nickel in the batter.

3. When the oil is hot, add as many coated onion rings to the batter
as will fit comfortably in the fryer; you will have to do this in
about 5 batches: Using chopsticks or a large fork, life the rings to
the hot oil and separate any that cling together. Fry the onion rings
until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper
towels or a paper bag to drain well. Repeat with the remaining onion
rings and batter. Sprinkle the onion rings with salt if desired.
Serve hot, warm or at room temperature with lemon, ketchup or soy
sauce. Serves 4 to 6. Food & Wine, June, 1991.
