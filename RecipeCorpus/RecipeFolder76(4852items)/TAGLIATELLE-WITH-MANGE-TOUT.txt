Title: TAGLIATELLE WITH MANGE-TOUT
Categories: Pasta, Stir-fry
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Mange-tout; cut diagonally
1    Shallot; sliced
2 tb Olive oil
1    Garlic clove; crushed
5 tb Single cream, 5 tbs
225 g  Fresh tagliatelle
-- cooked 'al dente'
Parmesan, grated
Pepper to taste
Crisp mange-tout are stir-fried with garlic and shallot and finished
with cream, making an appetizing sauce for fresh tagliatelle.
Sprinkled generously with cheese, the dish is then quickly browned
under the grill. All it needs is a tossed green salad to go with it.

Steam the sliced mange-tout until tender but still crisp, about 2-3
minutes. Soften the shallot in the oil and add the garlic. Stir in the
prepared mange-tout and season to taste with pepper. Add the cream
and heat through, stirring. Then toss the tagliatelle into the sauce
and put in a heatproof dish. Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan and
brown under a hot grill for a minute or less, then serve at once.
