Bring soy sauce to a boil, add butter in chunks, and stir until all is
incorporated.  Set aside.  Cook angel hair pasta in boiling salted
water until al dente.

Combine sesame oil with hot pepper oil (approximately 1 oz. total per
portion based on the desired hotness). Stir-fry lobsters in oils after

until al dente.

Add angel hair pasta and soy butter to mixture; toss everything
together. Place on center of each plate. Arrange hot lobster shells
on plates to appear as a whole lobster presentation.
