Mint-Chile Sauce-----
1 c  Plain yogurt
1 c  Fresh mint
1/2 c  Minced cilantro
1/2    Jalapeno chile -- minced

1. Soak skewers in water 15 minutes. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix
together ground lamb, onion, garlic, parsley, minced chile, bread
crumbs, eggs, salt, and pepper.

2. Preheat broiler. Wrap 1/3 cup lamb mixture around each bamboo
skewer to form a meatball about 3 inches long by 1-1/2 inches in
diameter. Place cornmeal on a plate and roll skewered meatball in
cornmeal to coat completely.

3. Brush broiler pan with a thin film of oil. Place meatball skewers
on broiler pan and broil 3 inches from heat until lightly browned on
one side (about 3 minutes). Turn and broil second side until lightly
browned (about
2    minutes).

4. To serve, place couscous on individual dinner plates, top with 2
meatballs on skewers, and drizzle with Mint-Chile Sauce.

Mint-Chile Sauce: In a small bowl stir together all ingredients. Let
sit 30 minutes for flavors to meld.

Makes about 2 cups.
