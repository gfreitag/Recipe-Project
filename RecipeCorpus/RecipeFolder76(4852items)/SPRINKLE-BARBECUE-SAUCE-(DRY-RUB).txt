Title: SPRINKLE BARBECUE SAUCE (DRY RUB)
Categories: Bbq sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Black pepper
6 tb Salt
1 1/2 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Cayenne pepper
3 tb Chili powder
4 tb Paprika
Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Before barbecuing chicken,
ribs, briskets, fish or pork chops, sprinkle on very heavy. This
mixture serves as a "dry" barbecue sauce but makes a crust, sealing
in juices.
