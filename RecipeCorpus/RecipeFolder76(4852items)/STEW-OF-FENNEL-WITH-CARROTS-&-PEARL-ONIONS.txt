Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
4    Fennel bulbs
1 tb Butter
1 ts Olive oil
2 c  Frozen pearl onions, thawed
1 ts Sugar
4 lg Carrots, cut into matchstix
1 c  Up to ...
1 1/2 c  Defatted reduced-sodium
Chicken stock
Salt & pepper to taste
2 tb Finely chopped fennel fronds
Or fresh parsley
Cut off fennel stalks and remove strings from the bulbs with a
vegetable peeler.  Cut each bulb into 8 wedges, but do not remove the
core. Bring salted water to a boil in a large saucepan, add fennel
and blanch for 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, blot with
paper towels and set aside. In a large cast-iron or non-stick
skillet, heat 1/2 T butter and 1/2 T oil together over medium high
heat. Add half the fennel and saute until nicely browned on all
sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a dish and reserve. Repeat with
the remaining butter, oil and fennel. Add onions to the skillet,
sprinkle with sugar and saute shaking the skillet back and forth,
until nicely browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Return the fennel to the
skillet; add carrots and 1 c stock. Season with salt & pepper and
simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender 15 to 20 minutes,
adding more stock as necessary to keep the stew moist. Garnish the
fennel fronds or parsley.
