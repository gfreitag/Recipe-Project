Title: STEKT MARINERT MAKRELL (GRILLED MARINATED MAC
Categories: Norwegian, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper, fresh ground
2 ts Onion; finely chopped
2    Mackerel (1 lb each)
1 1/2 tb Butter; melted
1 1/2 tb Oil (combine w/butter)
Remove the backbones from the fish without cutting them in half, or
have your fish dealer remove them. Preheat broiler. In a shallow
baking dish large enough to hold the fish laid out flat in one layer,
combine the oil, lemon juice, salt, black pepper and onions. Place
the mackerel in this marinade, flesh side down for 15 minutes, then
turn them over for another 15 minutes. Brush the broiler grill with 1
tablespoon of melted butter and oil and place the mackerel on it,
skin side down. Grill only one side about 3" from heat, basting from
time to time with remaining butter and oil. In 10 to 12 minutes they
should have turned a light golden color and their flesh should flake
easily when prodded with a fork. Serve at once, accompanied by
butter-steamed new potatoes and tomato or horse-radish butter. (See
recipes.)
