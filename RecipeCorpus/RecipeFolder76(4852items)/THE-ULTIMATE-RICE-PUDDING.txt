Title: THE ULTIMATE RICE PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Rice
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Milk
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Cooked rice
3 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla
Combine milk, sugar, rice and butter in a sauce pan and simmer until
thick about 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.
Serves 4, or 2 rice pudding freaks. You can use only half the amount
of sugar and substitute Half-and-half for the milk. In case a rice
pudding binge leads you to dieting, try the recipe with 1/4 cup of
sugar or granulated sugar substitute and skim milk or skim evaporated
milk. It is still super. It makes the best rice pudding for the least
effort of any we've tried. You may also try sprinkling 1/4 teaspoon
of nutmeg over the top when serving.
