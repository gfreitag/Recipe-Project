Categories: Desserts, Low-cal, Low-fat, Microwave
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Egg white, room temperature
2 ts Granulated sugar
1 ea Serving Non-stick Spray(Pam)
1 ts Powdered sugar, divided
1/8 ts White vinegar
1/8 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Fresh strawberries or kiwi
1 tb Whipped topping
Use a shallow rectangular baking dish, approximately 6 by 8 inches.
Spray with non-stick butter flavored cooking spray. Line with wax
paper cut to fit.  Spray again with Pam, dust lightly with 1/2 of the
powdered sugar. Set aside.  Whip egg white until firm peaks form. Add
sugar, vinegar and vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form, about 30
seconds to 1 minute more. Spread evenly in baking dish, and cook in
microwave oven for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on high. The meringue will
stretch and spread while baking, but will shrink back to proper size
while cooling, so don't panic! Cool meringue, and turn out onto wax
paper that has been lightly dusted with the remaining powdered sugar.
Spread with the tablespoon of whipped topping, top with the fruit and
gently roll up. Garnish with small piece of fruit and mint leaves.
Another dollop of whipped topping may be used on top with the fruit
garnish, but if you do so, add another 10 to 14 calories to the
total. Calorie Count: 100 calories. Fat: 1 gram. Total Preparation
Time: 5 minutes! This is a pavlova even a non-dieter can enjoy, and
it's QUICK.
