Chinese noodles are distinguised not only by their constituents but
by the way they're prepared. The noodles can be cooked, mixed,
blended, and combined with just about every variety of meat, seafood,
and vegetable. They can be added to soup, either alone, or with
various toppings..etc etc

LO MEIN means "tossed or mixed noodles" and calls for parboiled
noodles (also previously drained dry and chilled) to be added, not to
the hot oil and soft- fried as in CHOW MEIN, but directly to the meat
and vegetable combinations, which have already been stir-fried. These
noodles, tossed or mixed and heated through with the cooked
combinations, are moister, having more of a sauce than the CHOW MEIN.
