1 c  Flour
1/4 c  Dried Minced Onion
2 tb Parsley
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Poultry Seasoning
1/2 ts Garlic Powder
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Pepper
1 ts Tabasco Sauce
1 c  Tomato Juice
1.  Preheat oven to 425  degrees. 2.  Cut ribs into 2-inch pieces and
brush them with a teaspoon or two of vegetable oil. Combine crumbs,
flour, and spices in a paper bag; add ribs and shake them in the
seasonings. Spread the seasoned ribs in a greased baking dish, and
sprinkle the Tabasco sauce on top. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes. 3.
Baste the ribs once or twice during the cooking process and cover the
baking dish with aluminum foil if the ribs are browning too quickly.
Make a sauce from the cooking liquid by adding the tomato juice right
after you remove the ribs from the pan. Source:  Cheaper and Better
