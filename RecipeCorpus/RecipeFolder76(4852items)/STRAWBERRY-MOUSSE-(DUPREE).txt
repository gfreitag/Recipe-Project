Categories: Dessert, Fruit
1 pt strawberries -- hulled
Yield: 4 Servings
1    lemon -- juiced
1/2 c  water
2    envelopes gelatin
2    eggs
1    egg yolk
6 TB sugar
3/4 c  heavy cream -- whipped
*For Decoration
:
1 1/2 c  heavy cream -- stiffly
whipped
:
1    whole strawberries

Lightly oil a 1-quart ring mold, charlotte mold, or bowl. Puree the
strawberries in a food processor or blender. They should yield at
least 1 cup of puree. Set aside. Place the lemon juice, water, and
gelatin in a very small, heatproof pan, 1-cup metal measure, or
microwave dish and let stand 5 minutes, or until spongy. Mix the
eggs, egg yolk, and sugar ina heatproof bowl. Beat them with an
electric mixer or whisk over nearly boiling water until the mixture
is thick and light in color and the whisk leaves a light trail.
Remove from the heat and continue to beat until the mixture is cool.

Dissolve the gelatin over low heat or in the microwave, making sure
all the granules are dissolved. Stir the liquid gelatin into the egg
yolk mixture. Add the puree. Place the entire mixture over a pan of
ice water and stir with a rubber spatula until the mixture is at the
point of setting. Fold in the softly whipped cream. Pour the mousse
into the prepared mold. Cover and chill until set, 3 to 4 hours or
overnight. Lightly oil a serving plate. Tilt the mousse in its mold
and pull it gently away from the sides to catch an air bubble. Place
the oiled plate over the mold, then invert. Give a quick shake and
remove the mold. Put the stiffly whipped cream into a pastry bag or
plastic bag fitted with a star tip and decorate with rosettes of
whipped cream. Place a whole berry on top of each. May be made up to
1 day in advance. Make 4 or 6.
