Title: STUFFED ARTICHOKES ITALIAN STYLE
Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Italian
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Med artichokes
1 1/2 c  Soft Italian bread, grated
1/4 c  Fresh parsley
1/2 c  Grated Romano cheese
Salt and pepper
1    Clove garlic chopped
Olive oil
Salt and more garlic
Soak 6 med. artichokes in cold water 1/2 hour. Stand on counter and
trim points off leaves with scissors and cut off bottoms so they will
be flat to sit in pan. Then, standing artichokes upside down, give
them a firm whack so that leaves will open slightly to put stuffing
in. Combine all ingredients with enough oil to moisten bread mixture.
Stuff inside of leaves. Place stuffed artichokes in a pan of water (
about 1 1/4 cups water ) to which 1 tsp salt and 3 crushed garlic
cloves have been added. Sprinkle more oil over artichokes and simmer
slowly for 45 minutes or tender.
