Preheat the oven to 375#161#F. Lightly coat a 1-quart ovenproof
casserole dish with vegetable oil and set aside.

If using fresh spinach, wash thoroughly in cold water. Remove the
stems and place the leaves in a large pot. With just the water that
is clinging to the leaves, cook the spinach over low heat, covered,
until it becomes wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain well and when cool
enough to handle, squeeze out as much water as possible, then chop.
If using frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture. Place in a medium
bowl.

In the same pot, heat the vermouth and oil over low heat. Add the
shallots and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the
flour and blend together well. Cook 1 minute, then add the yogurt.
Cook, stirring, until thick and bubbly. Season with salt, pepper,
nutmeg and cayenne. Add the spinach and stir until all the
ingredients are well combined. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

In a small bowl, whisk together the feta cheese and eggs, then blend
into this the spinach mixture. Spoon into the casserole dish, then
set this dish in a large pan. Fill the pan with 1/2 inch of boiling
water and place in the oven. Bake until the pudding is puffed and
golden brown, about 35 minutes.

Serve the pudding immediately with a sauceboat of hot Mornay Sauce
