500 g  White fleshed sweet potatoes
2 tb Olive oil
1    Onion, finely chopped
4    Tomatoes
900 ml Beef stock
1/2 bn Fresh coriander leaves
If you serve this to guests it is odds on no-one will know what the
soup is based on. It is also a good bet that there will be takers for
seconds.

Wash, peel and cut into chunks 500 g white-fleshed sweet potatoes and
boil until tender. Drain well and set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan and saute 1 onion,
finely chopped, until transparent. Meanwhile pour boiling water over
4 tomatoes in a bowl, leave for 2 minutes and drain. Peel the
tomatoes (the skin will pull off easily) and chop them. Add tomatoes
to the onions and cook for about 5 minutes until soft.

Into a blender or food processor put the sweet potatoes and the tomato
mixture. Add 300 ml beef stock and puree. Return to the saucepan, add
a further 600 ml stock, adjust seasoning to taste and reheat. Finely
chop half a bunch of coriander leaves. Ladle the soup into bowls and
scatter the coriander over the top.
