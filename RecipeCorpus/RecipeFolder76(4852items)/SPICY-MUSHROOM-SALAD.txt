Title: SPICY MUSHROOM SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 2 Servings
1 tb Crunchy peanut butter
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Raspberry vinegar
3 tb Dark sesame oil
2 tb Mayonnaise
225 g  Button mushrooms
-- finely sliced
Chopped coriander
This salad, made with finely sliced raw mushrooms, has a highly
unusual dressing based on an Indonesian recipe, with a touch of
originality - some raspberry vinegar. Pile the dressed mushrooms into
soft lettuce leaves, and serve with garlic bread.

Mix the peanut butter with the soy sauce, raspberry vinegar and
sesame oil and blend well. Stir into the mayonnaise. Dress the sliced
mushrooms with the mixture, tossing so that they are thoroughly
coated. Leave to stand for at least 2 hours. Garnish with chopped
coriander leaves.
