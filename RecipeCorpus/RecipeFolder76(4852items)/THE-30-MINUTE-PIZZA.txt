Believe it or not, this pizza is ready in half an hour. PREHEAT OVEN
TO 500F.

(MIXING AND KNEADING: 1 1/2 MINUTES.) Place the yeast and 1 cup of the
flour in the bowl of a food processor and pulse once using the metal
knife or the plastic dough blade. With the machine running, pour in
the hot water (make certain it's hot when you use it). As soon as
it's in, turn the machine off; add the salt and remaining 2 cups of
flour. Next, pulse until the dough begins to hold together; then let
the machine run continously until a ball of dough forms.

(ASSEMBLY: 5 MINUTES.) Lightly oil the pan with vegetable oil and
dust with coarsely ground yellow cornmeal. Press the dough out into
an 8-inch circle with your fingertips and then roll or stretch it out
into a 15-or-18-inch pizza shell. Fit the shell onto prepared pan.
Sprinkle desired toppings over dough, and finish with a drizzling of
olive oil. Bake 15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the
topping is bubbly. For a well-done crust bake 5 minutes longer. Makes
