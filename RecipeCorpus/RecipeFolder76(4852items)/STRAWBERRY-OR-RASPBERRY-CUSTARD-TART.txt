CRUST: Finely grind almonds in a food processor with an on/off
mixture with a rolling pin until as finely ground as possible. Add
flour, salt and brown sugar to processor and blend, or combine ground
almonds, flour, salt, and brown sugar in a bowl and stir to blend.
Add butter and process or work with the fingertips until mixture
ressembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl beat egg lightly. Stir in
the vanilla and lemon zest. With processor on, add egg mixture to the
dough through feed tube and process until dough forms. Pat dough into
a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for at least
30 minutes. Remove dough from refrigerator. Press in 10 inch tart pan
(with removable bottom), patting in even minutes before baking. Bake
line with foil for 15 minutes, remove foil and bake a further 20 to
30 minutes empty. CUSTARD CREAM: In a medium mixing bowl, beat egg
yolks and sugar until pale yellow and thick. Beat in 4 tbsp all
purpose flour. Heat half-and-half in medium sized non reactive
saucepan over low heat until small bubbles form around edges. Remove
from heat and pour a small amount of hot mixture into egg yolk
mixture, whisking constantly. Add remaining half and half mixture,
whisking. Pour mixture back into pan on heat, lower heat and cook it,
stirring for 5-7 minutes. Add vanilla, let the mixture cool and chill
it, covered (use plastic wrap) until needed. ASSEMBLY: Spread Custard
Cream even over fully baked almond crust. Arrange hulled strawberries
or raspberries in concentric circles, stem ends down, over pastry
cream. Melt red currant jelly with 1 tsp lemon juice and brush the
glaze gently over the fruit.
