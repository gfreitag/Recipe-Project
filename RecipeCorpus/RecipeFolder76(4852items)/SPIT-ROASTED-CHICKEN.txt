Categories: Chicken
Yield: 1 Servings
5 lb Chicken; trussed
4 sl Bacon; blanched
Salt and pepper; to taste
3 tb Butter
Recipe by: Julia Child - Mastering the Art of French Cooking I
Sprinkle the inside of the chicken with the salt and pepper. Truss
the chicken. Push the spit through it starting at the breast end. Dry
it thoroughly, rub with butter and sprinkle with salt. Secure the
strips of blanched bacon over the breast and thighs with string.
Because of the bacon, no basting is necessary until the very end.

Use moderate heat and rotisserie for about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours.
Remove the bacon 15 minutes before the end, and baste with the pan
drippings until the chicken is browned and done.
