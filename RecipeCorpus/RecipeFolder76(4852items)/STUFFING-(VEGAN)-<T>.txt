Title: STUFFING (VEGAN) <T>
Categories: Digest, Nov., Thanksgivin
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Pureed onions
2 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Pureed celery
1 c  Chopped or grated carrots
1 lb Fresh mushrooms or 8 oz
Canned mushrooms, sliced
2 tb Dried parsley
1 ts Poultry seasonings (I
Believe this is vegan), more
To taste
x  Ground black pepper to
Taste
x  Ground sage to taste
1 lg Bag of Pepperidge Farms
Whole wheat/white bread mix
Stuffing
Cubes (the stuff without any
Seassonings)
x  Vegetable broth to add
Moisture, if needed (about 1
To 2 cups)
Heat onions, celery, carrots, shrooms and spices/herbs in a large pot
until it all boils.  Simmer for about 5 ~ 10 minutes or until the
chopped onions are translucent. Cool for 10 minutes, then add the
stuffing mix. Mix well, adding vegetable broth if necessary for
moisture. Place in a big covered baking dish and cook in a pre-heated
350 oven for 30 minutes. Taking the cover off during the last 10 to
15 minutes should get you a crusty top for the stuffing.

Variations:  you can probably add some of that vegetarian Italian
sausage that comes in links (I have some but haven't tried it yet),
browned first, to the mix for a more traditional taste. And chopped
apples, chopped spinach or any other vegetable you like can probably
be added. Even my father-in-law, diehard New Englander and
meat-and-potatoes man, liked this.
