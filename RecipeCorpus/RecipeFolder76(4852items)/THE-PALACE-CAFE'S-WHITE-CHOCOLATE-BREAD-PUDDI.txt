In double boiler, heat milk, sugar, eggs and yolks until warm. Blend
egg mixture into cream and chocolate mixture.

Place bread slices in a baking pan - pour one-half mixture over bread
and let settle (let bread soak up mixture) and then top with rest of
mixure. Cover with foil and bake for one hour at 275 degrees. Remove
foil and bake for 15 minutes until top is golden brown.

To make sauce: Gently melt white chocolate in double boiler; remove
from heat and mix in heavy cream. Spoon over bread pudding.

To serve: Spoon hot out of pan or let cool to room temperature; then
place in refrigerator for about 45 minutes. Loosen sides and invert
pan. Cut into squares, circles, triangles, etc. Top with sauce and
sprinkle with chocolate shavings.
