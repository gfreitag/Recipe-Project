Title: TAWNY ROASTED PHEASANTS
Categories: Wild game
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Pheasants, about 2 1/2 lb ea
2    Oranges; halved
1/4 c  Olive oil
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
8    Sprigs flat-leaf parsley
4    Garlic cloves; peeled and
-bruised
2    Bay leaves
12 sl Bacon
1/2 c  Defatted chicken broth
1/4 c  Tawny port
Autumn Pear Salsa (see
-separate recipe)
When cooking pheasant or any wild game birds, I always squeeze an
orange or two in the cavity and on the outside to refresh the bird
before cooking. As the meat is very lean, it's necessary to cover the
breast with bacon to add extra moisture during roasting. Basting with
liquid from the pan also is essential. - Shiela Lukins

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

2. Rinse the pheasants, cleaning the cavities well. Remove any excess
fat. Pat dry.

3. Squeeze the oranges all over the birds and inside the cavities.
Brush with olive oil and sprinkle inside and out with salt and
pepper. Place 4 sprigs of parsley, 2 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf
in each cavity.

4. Place the birds in a shallow roasting pan to fit. Arrange 6 slices
of bacon over each pheasant.  Add the chicken broth and the port to
the pan.

5. Bake for 1 1/2 hours (remove the bacon after an hour), basting two
or three times.  Then bake 15-20 minutes longer or until the breasts
are brown and the birds are cooked through. (The juices should run
clear when the thickest part of the thigh is tested with the tip of a
knife.) Let rest 10 minutes. Carve and serve with Autumn Pear Salsa.
