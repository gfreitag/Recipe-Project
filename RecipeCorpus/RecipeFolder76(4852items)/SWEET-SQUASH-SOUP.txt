Title: SWEET SQUASH SOUP
Categories: Digest, Mcdougall
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Butternut or Buttercup
-Squash
1 1/2 c  Sliced onion
1 1/2 c  Peeled and chopped apple
1 c  Chopped carrot
2    To 3 teaspoons minced fresh
-ginger
5 c  Water
Put the whole squash in a microwave oven and cook on high power for 8
minutes.  Peel the squash and cut into cubes. (If you don't have a
microwave oven, this step may be omitted. This brief cooking time
simply makes the squash easier to peel and cut up.)  Place all of the
ingredients in a large soup pot and simmer over medium-low heat for
45 minutes. Place the soup in a blender or food processor, in
batches, and blend until smooth and creamy.

It's straight out of the New McDougall Cookbook, but you may have just
flipped past it, as I did many times. It's definitely worth making.
It's slightly sweet and the ginger subtlety blends with the other
flavors. The only possible modification I'd make is to use less
water. I ended up dumping some of the liquid (maybe 2 cups) after the
soup had simmered, and then blended it. The result was very creamy
and very delicious.
