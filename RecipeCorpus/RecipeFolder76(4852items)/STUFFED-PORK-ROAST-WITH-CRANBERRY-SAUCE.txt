Categories: Pork
Yield: 10 Servings
4 lb Boneless pork loin, untied
4 tb Butter
2 sm Onion; peeled & thinly
-sliced
1 c  Pecans
1/2 c  Baguette, day old; crusts
-removed
2 oz Smoked ham
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper, black
1 c  ;Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1 lb Cranberries
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper, black
Pat the pork loin dry with paper toweling; set aside. Melt the butter
in a medium heavy skillet over medium high heat. Reduce the heat, and
add the onion. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, about 30
minutes. Transfer the onion to a food processor. Add the pecans,
bread, ham, salt and pepper. Mince, using on and off turns.

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Spread a quarter to half the stuffing over
the pork loin, fold and tie it with butcher's twine at 1 1/2"
intervals. Place the roast on the rack of a roasting pan. Place in
the oven and roast until the internal temperature reaches 160 F.;
about 1 1/2 hours.

Bake the remaining dressing in a small casserole for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the water and sugar in a three-quart non-aluminum
saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium high heat, making sure the
sugar is dissolved. Add the cranberries; reduce the heat. Cover and
simmer until the berries pop open, about five minutes. PurÂ‚e in a
food processor and strain to remove the skins. Stir in salt and
pepper. Heat again, gently if necessary, before serving.

Let the roast stand ten minutes before slicing thinly to serve. Serve
the pork with extra stuffing on the side, with cranberry sauce.
