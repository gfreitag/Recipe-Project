Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Milk
6    Egg yolks
6 tb Sugar
1    Lemon, grated zest of
1/4 c  All purpose flour
1 1/2 c  Very fine, dry unflavored
-breadcrumbs
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
Oil for frying

Servings: 6 to 8

DIRECTIONS: Bring milk to a boil in a medium saucepan. In a large
heavy saucepan off the heat, beat egg yolks, granulated sugar and
lemon zest until pale and thick. Beat in flour until well blended.
Very slowly pour in hot milk, beating constantly. Cook custard cream
over medium heat 5 to 8 minutes, beating constantly. Do not let boil.
Custard cream is done when it coats the back of a spoon. Moisten a
large plate or cookie sheet with water. Spread cooked cream to a
thickness of 1/2 to 1 inch. Cream can be prepared to this point a day
or two ahead. When cream is completely cooled, cut into squares or
diamonds. Place breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Coat cream shapes with
breadcrumbs. Dip coated cream shapes into beaten eggs, and coat again
with breadcrumbs. Pour oil 2 inches deep in a large saucepan or
deep-fryer. Heat oil to 375-F (190-C) or until a 1-inch cube of bread
turns golden brown almost immediately. Using a slotted spoon, lower
cream pieces a few at a time into hot oil. Turn cream pieces. When
golden on both sides, remove from oil with slotted spoon. Drain on
paper towels. Arrange drained fried cream on a platter and sprinkle
with powdered sugar. Serve hot.
