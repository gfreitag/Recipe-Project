mixture for Stirred Custard Sauce by placing the glass measure inside
a larger bowl filled with ice water. After stirring the mixture, stir
in the Galliano, brandy or Amaretto and the vanilla. Adding these
ingredients at this stage speeds the cooling of the custard and helps

the surface of the custard befroe it is refrigerated. Covering the
surface will prevent a "skin" from forming on the top of the custard
sauce.
