Cut lamb into 1-1/4 inch cubes.  Combine in a bowl with 2 cups
yogurt, 2 teaspoons salt, a good grinding of black pepper and the
turmeric or pounded saffron threads. Cover and marinate in
refrigerator for 6 hours or overnight.

Pick over rice and wash well until water runs clear. Boil water, add 2
tablespoons salt and the rice, stir and return to the boil. Leave
uncovered and boil for 5 minutes. Drain in colander or large sieve.

Beat egg yolks in a bowl, stir in 1/2 cup yogurt and 1-1/2 cups of the
rice.  Place melted ghee and hot water in a 10-cup casserole or Dutch
oven. Swirl to coat sides. Spread egg, yogurt and rice mixture evenly
over base.

Arrange half the lamb cubes over this with some of the yogurt
marinade. Add a layer of rice, remaining lamb mixture, and all but
1/2 cup of marinade. Top with remaining rice and spread reserved
yogurt marinade on top. Cover casserole or Dutch oven with lid and
cook tah chin in a moderate oven for 1-1/2 hours.

Spoon rice and lamb mixture into center of serving dish. Lift off
crusty layer from bottom of dish and break into large pieces. Arrange
around edge of dish. Alternatively if a Dutch oven has been used,
place on cold surface or in cold water for 5-10 minutes, run a knife
blade around edge of contents and invert serving dish on top. Tip
upside down so that contents can come out like a cake. Cut in wedges
to serve.
