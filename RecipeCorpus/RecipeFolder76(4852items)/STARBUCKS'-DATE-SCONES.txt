Title: STARBUCKS' DATE SCONES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/4 c  Bran
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Butter, unsalted; chilled
1    Egg
2/3 c  Buttermilk
2/3 c  Chopped dates
Combine the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, the bran, baking
powder, soda, salt, cinnamon and brown sugar. Cut in the butter. (Or
combine in a food processor, just until crumbly.) Add the egg,
buttermilk and dates; do not overmix.  (If the dough seems too sticky
to work with add a couple more tablespoons flour.) Shape the dough
into a rectangle about 1 inch thick on a floured surface. Cut into 12
triangles. Bake on an ungreased baking sheet in a preheated
350-degree oven about 25 minutes. Cool on a rack.
