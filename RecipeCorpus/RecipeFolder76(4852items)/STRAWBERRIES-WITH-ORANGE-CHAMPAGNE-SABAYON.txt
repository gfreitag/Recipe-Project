1/2 c  Champagne, dry
1/4 c  Whipping cream, chilled

Servings:   4

**other sparkling wine may be substituted for the Champagne.

My notes:  The egg yolk mixture didn't get thick enough (using large
eggs), so next time I plan to increase the amount to 4 yolks.

Whisk sugar, egg yolks and orange peel in a medium metal bowl until
pale yellow and thick, about 3 minutes. Set bowl over saucepan of
simmering water. Add Champagne to yolk mixture and whisk until
mixture is doubled in volume and holds shape on spoon, about 5
minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Set over another bowl filled
with ice. Cool completely, whisking occasionally.

Using electric mixer, beat cream with Grand Marnier in small bowl
until almost stiff. Fold cream and Grand Marnier into sabayon. (Can
be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)

Preheat broiler. Divide strawberries among 4 shallow broilerproof
bowls or gratin dishes. Spoon sabayon over. Broil until light brown,
about 2 minutes. Garnish with mint and serve.
