Strawberries need not be confined to dessert, says Denis Pelletier,
chef at Restaurant Le Mouilin de St. Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. The
island is one of the province's lushest strawberry-growing areas. The
chef suggests serving this colourful salad with a semi-soft cheese as
St. Nectaire. Make a salad dressing by combining vinegar, oil and
water. Add chopped shallots and pepper to taste. Arrange sliced
strawberries in a spiral formation on the spinach and drizzle with
the dressing. SERVES:6
