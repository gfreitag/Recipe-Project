Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.

Pull off the outer dark green leaves of each artichoke until what
remains is pale at the base and green at the ends of tips. Cut off
the green points to about 1-inch from top of pointy end. Each time
you cut the artichoke rub the freshly cut sides with half a lemon.
This will retain its light color. Cut the artichokes into quarters.
Using a small sharp knife, trim away the choke from the inside. rub
all cut edges with lemon. Boil 5 minutes and refresh in cold water.
Drain and set aside.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a medium saute pan saute onion and
garlic over medium heat in 3 ounces of olive oil until softened, 8 to
10 minutes. Allow to cool and stir in parsley, grated cheese and
fresh toasted bread crumbs. Season with salt and pepper. In a shallow
casserole, just large enough to hold artichokes in one layer. Bake
uncovered about 20 minutes or until breadcrumbs and golden brown.

Yield: 4 as antipasto
