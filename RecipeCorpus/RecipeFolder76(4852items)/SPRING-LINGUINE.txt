Bring salted water to a boil. While the water is coming to a boil
prepare the ingredients you will need for your sauce. Add the
linguine to the salted water and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until
cooked but still firm to the bite.

Meanwhile heat the bacon in a skillet. When the fat has rendered and
the bacon bits are crisp, add the scallions and asparagus and cook
over moderate heat, stirring continuously, for about 2 minutes or
until the asparagus are crisp tender.

Drain the pasta (reserving a tablespoonful of cooking water) and
portion it into pasta bowls.

Add the water, lemon juice and butter to the asparagus skillet and
swirl the ingredients around until the liquid and butter form a
little emulsion. Season to taste with salt and pepper and spoon over
the pasta. Garnish with cheese and olives.

Yield: 2 servings
