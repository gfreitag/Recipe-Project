2 tb Olive oil from tomatoes
2 tb Sugar
2 cl Garlic; minced
2 lg Eggs; lightly beaten
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 350~. Grease 3 small loaf pans (5-1/2x3x2-1/4").
In a small bowl, whisk together the shortening, oil and sugar until
smooth. Add the garlic, eggs and buttermilk; whisk until the mixture
is well combined. Set aside. In a large bowl, sift together the
flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Mix in the cheese,
scallions, parsley, pepper and tomatoes. Make a well in the center
and add the buttermilk mixture and pine nuts. Stir until just
combined. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans and smooth the
tops. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Set the pans on
wire racks and allow the loaves to cool in the pans for about 10
minutes. Loosen the edges with a knife and turn the loaves out onto
the racks to cool completely. Well-wrapped in foil and chilled, the
loaves will keep for up to 4 days. Source: Sun-Dried Tomatoes! (wrv)
