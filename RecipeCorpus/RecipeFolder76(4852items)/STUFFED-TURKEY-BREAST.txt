Title: STUFFED TURKEY BREAST
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
1/4 c  Melted butter
1 sm Onion -- finely chopped
1/2 c  Celery -- finely chopped
2 1/2 oz Package bacon croutons
1 c  Chicken bouillon
2 tb Fresh minced parsley
1/2 ts Poultry seasoning
1    Whole uncooked turkey breast
(~5 lbs.)
Salt and pepper
24    X36 inches cheesecloth
Dry white wine
Combine butter, onion, celery, croutons, boullion, parsley, and
poultry seasoning.  Cut turkey breast in thick slices, from
breastbone to rib cage, leaving slices attached to bone. Sprinkle
turkey with salt and pepper. Soak cheesecloth in wine.  Set turkey on
cheesecloth. Stuff bread mixture into slits of turkey. Fold one end
of cheesecloth over other to cover meat. Place on metal rack or
trivet in slow-cooking pot. Cover pot and cook on low 7 to 9 hours or
until tender. Pour additional wine over turkey during cooking.
Remove from pot and take cheesecloth off immediately. If browner
breast is preferred, remove from pot and brown in 400 F oven for 15
to 20 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Drippings may be thickened for
gravy if desired.  Serve each person one or more thick slices of
turkey with dressing in between.
