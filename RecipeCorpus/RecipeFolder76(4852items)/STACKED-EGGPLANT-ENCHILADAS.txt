In a non-stick skillet saute each tortilla briefly on both sides with
a few drops of olive oil until fragrant and very lightly browned. Set
aside on paper towels.

Filling:

Slice the eggplant into 1/2-inch thick rounds discarding the stem.
Brush lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and
grill or roast in a preheated 400 degree oven until eggplant is
cooked through and lightly browned. Coarsely chop and set aside in a
bowl. While eggplant is cooking add onion, garlic, celery and pepper
to a saute pan with a tablespoon of olive oil and cook over
moderately high heat until crisp tender and lightly browned. Add to
eggplant along with corn, tomatoes and almonds and toss gently to
combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

In a lightly oiled baking dish, alternate a layer of tortillas,
eggplant filling, two thirds of the Tomatillo Sauce and crumbled
cheese ending with a tortilla. Place uncovered in a preheated 375
degree oven for 15-20 minutes to heat through. Slice into wedges and
serve with remaining Tomatillo Sauce and garnish with a scattering of
diced red peppers, avocado and cilantro sprigs.
