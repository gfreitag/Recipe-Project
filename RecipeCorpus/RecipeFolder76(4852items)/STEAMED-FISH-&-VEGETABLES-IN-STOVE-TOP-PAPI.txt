Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar snap peas -- blanched
For 10
Seconds
2    Boneless pieces of halibut
(6 to 8 ounces -- 3/4-inch
Thick
Each)
Extra virgin olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
4 sm Vine ripened tomatoes --
Halved
Basil leaves cut with
Scissors
Tear off 2 large pieces of plastic wrap (the type which is designed
to use in the microwave oven); each one should be large enough to
enclose the fish and vegetables in a single layer.

Rub lemon juice on both sides of halibut. Layer half cup of snow peas
on bottom of plastic wrap and drizzle with a teaspoon of olive oil.
Place fish over that and bring up plastic wrap to totally enclose the
fish.

Set a cake rack over simmering water in a deep skillet. Turn fish
packages upside down so snow peas are on top. Layer them on the cake
rack and cover with a round bowl or cover to entrap steam. Cook for 5
minutes or until fish and vegetables are cooked through.

While fish is steaming, remove tomato seeds with a spoon and cut them
into a fine dice; toss with dice with a bit of olive oil, salt and
pepper and spoon the tomatoes on dinner plates.

When fish is done, with scissors, carefully open package (watch out
for your hands). Pose fish and vegetables over tomatoes and drizzle
juices over the top; season with salt and pepper and garnish top with
basil.

Yield: 2 servings
