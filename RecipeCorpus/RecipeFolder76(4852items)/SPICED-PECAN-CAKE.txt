Title: SPICED PECAN CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
1/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground nutmeg
1 c  Unsalted butter
2 ts Plus 2 tsp vanilla extract
2 c  Sugar
3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Plus 2 tbsp milk
3    Egg whites
Grease and flour three 8" round cake pans (1 1/2" deep). Place the
pecans in a large ungreased roasting pan. Roast nuts @ 425 degrees
for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Watch, carefully, lower heat,
if necessary. Meanwhile, in a medium size bowl, combine brown sugar,
cinnamon and nutmeg. Then, mix in 4 tbsp of butter. Add 2 cups
roasted pecans to the butter mixture. Coat them thoroughly. Return
mixture to the pan and roast for 10 minutes more, stirring once or
twice. Stir in 2 tbsp vanilla extract and roast 5 minutes more.
Remove from oven and set aside. In a large bowl of an electric mixer,
cream 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar on high speed until very
light and fluffy, about 6 to 8 minutes. In a separate bowl, sift
together flour and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine milk and
remaining 2 tsp vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and the milk
mixture, alternately, to the butter, beating on high speed until well
blended and scraping the bowl sides between additions. Stir in the
pecans. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites on high speed until
frothy, about 30 seconds. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue
beating until mixture holds peaks, about 2 minutes. Gently, fold egg
white mixture into the batter, one third at a time. Spoon batter into
prepared cake pans and spread batter so that it is slightly lower in
the center. Bake @ 350 degrees until a toothpick inserted near the
center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool 1 minute, then
carefully remove from the pans and place on a wire rack. Cool
thoroughly. Glaze. Spread generously with frosting between layers and
on top and sides.
