Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut off the flower end of each
tomato, leaving the stem end intact. Set aside the cap and hollow out
the tomatoes, discarding the pulp. Invert thetomatoes on a plate and
drain. In a nonstick saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the
green onions and garlic and saute until soft. Add the flour, Parmesan
cheese, breadcrumbs, and herbs. Heat for 1 minute, then add the
drained spinach, Yogurt Cheese, and salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cayenne
to taste, stirring until well combined. Spoon the spinach mixture
into the tomatoes and top with the optional Parmesan if using. The
stuffed tomatoes and their caps can be made to this point up to 3
days in advance. Place the tomatoes in an ovenproof serving dish and
bake until heated through, about 10 minutes. Top each tomato with the
reserved cap and bake 5 minutes more. Serve hot.
