The Parsis, a tiny ethnic group displaced in ancient times from
Persia to India, have a distinctive cuisine. Some years ago, Perviz
Parakh, a member of the Parsi community in Melboume, published a
booklet con- taining this recipe.

Finely chop 2 large onions and fry in 3 tablespoons of oil until
golden brown.  Add to the onions 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1
teaspoon chilli powder, 1/2 teaspoon of ground turmeric and salt to
taste. Stir to mix and continue to cook for a few minutes.  Chop 1/2
kg of ripe tomatoes and 1 green chilli and finely chop a bunch of
fresh coriander. Add them to the onion mixture and cook until the
tomatoes are done and there is not too much juice left in the pan.
Add 2 tablespoons brown vinegar and 6 teaspoons brown sugar and cook
5 minutes longer.

Transfer the tomato mixture to a lightly greased gratin dish (or 6
individual gratin dishes).  Smooth the surface and make 12 hollows
with the back of a spoon. Slide an egg into each hollow. Bake the
dish in a preheated 180C oven for about 25 minutes or until the egg
whites are set.

Makes 6 servings.
