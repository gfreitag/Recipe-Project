Title: TAVERN ON THE GREEN'S ROAST PORK SANDWICH
Categories: Pork, Sandwiches
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Aioli OR dijon mustard mayo
1    Soft lavosh (Armenian
-flat bread
1/4 c  Roasted red onions; sliced
1/4 c  Roasted potatoes; diced
1/4 c  Oven-dried roma tomatoes;
-chopped
1/4 c  Romaine lettuce; jullienned
1/4 lb Smoked roasted pork loin;
-thinly sliced
TO ROAST ONIONS: Place very thin slices on a baking sheet, drizzle
with virgin olive oil, sprinkle with kosher (coarse) salt and freshly
ground pepper and roast in a preheated 350'F oven until tender but
not colored, about 3 to 5 minutes.

TO ROAST POTATOES: Toss with olive oil and bake in a preheated 350'F
oven until soft, about 20 minutes.

TO OVEN-DRY TOMATOES: Cut them in half lengthwise and place them,
skin side down, on a baking sheet. Drizzle with virgin olive oil,
sprinkle with fresh thyme, kosher salt, fresh black pepper and sugar
and bake in a preheated 250'F oven until the tomatoes shrink, about 4
1/2 hours. Store in olive oil.

1. Spread aioli or Dijon mayonnaise on lavosh, leaving a half-inch
margin across the top.

2. Layer onions, potatoes, tomatoes and lettuce on top, always
leaving the top 1/2-inch uncovered. Top vegetables with pork in one
layer.

3. From the bottom, roll the sandwich tightly and evenly toward the
top. Press the empty margin firmly against the roll to seal the
sandwich.

4. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes so the roll
is firm enough to cut.
