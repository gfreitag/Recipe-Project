Title: STRAWBERRY DIVINITY
Categories: Candies, Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
3 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Corn syrup
3/4 c  Water
2    Egg whites, stiffly beaten
1 pk Strawberry jello
1/2 c  Coconut
1 c  Pecans, chopped
Combine sugar, syrup and water and bring to a boil, stiring
constantly, reduce heat to low and cook to hard ball stage (252
degrees). This can be determined by dropping small amounts of mixture
into cold cup of water. If it becomes stiff and hard then it is ready.

Combine whites and Jello beat until mix forms a peak, pour hot syrup
in thin stream over egg whites and jello. Beat until loses its gloss
and holds its shape. Fold in coconut and nuts. Drop in teaspoons onto
waxed paper. Let set until they are hard.
