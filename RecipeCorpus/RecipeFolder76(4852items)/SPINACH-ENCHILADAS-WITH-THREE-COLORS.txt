1.  Make the stuffing. Put the cottage cheese and cream cheese in food
processor and blend till smooth. Add the other ingredients and stir
into cheese mixture. 2. Red sauce: This is my way of doing this. YOu
can use any red chili sauce recipe here.Wash chilis and remove seeds
unless you want this REALLY hot.
Boil water in saucepan. Add chilis and turn off heat and let soak.
Melt butter in frying pan. Add onions and garlic and saute until
clear. Set aside. Put chilis and water in food processor and blend
until smooth. Add flour to butter mix and make a roux. Add chili with
liquid and make a sauce. You may have to add water or a small can of
tomato sauce. I don't use the tomato sauce. Simmer until thickened
stirring constantly. Set aside. 3.  Simmer tomatillos in water until
tender.Add to food processor and blend until smooth. Saute onion and
garlic in a bit of oil or butter in frying pan and add to tomatillos
4. Dip tortillas in the red sauce while it is simmering to soften
them. Fill with a dollop of the cheese and spinach mixture and roll
and put in glass casserole sprayed with pan spray, seam side down. 5.
Cover with red sauce. 6. Add tomatillo sauce 7. Dollops of sour cream
can be put on top of this. This makes a red green and white casserole
to compliment the Mexican flag. I like to garnish with chopped fresh
cilantro. Emilie rwsm05a
