Title: THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/4 c  Unbleached White Flour
1 1/2 c  Warm Water
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
1/2 c  Cocoa
1 1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
1 1/2 ts White Vinegar
3/4 ts Salt
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Wait 10 minutes before starting
to make the cake.  Meanwhile, spray and flour 2 8-inch layer pans.

2.  Thoroughly combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a
bowl.

3. Pour in the water, oil, vanilla, and vinegar and stir until well
combined.  Pour into prepared pans. Bake 30 minutes or until a knife
inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire
rack 10 minutes, then remove the cakes from the pans and cool
completely.

4. Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.  (Use vegan margarine
and a bit of soy milk instead of butter and milk. )

Good luck!  My daughter is also vegan and coming home on spring break
soon. Think I'll bake her this treat. Thanks for reminding me
