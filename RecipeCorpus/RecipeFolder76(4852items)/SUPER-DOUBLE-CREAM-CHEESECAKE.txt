Categories: Cakes, Cheesecakes
Yield: 10 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1    Box (8.5 oz.) chocolate
Wafer cookies
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Ground cinnamon
Pinch of salt
6 tb Unsalted butter, melted
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3    (8 oz.) packages cream
Cheese, softened
2/3 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3    Eggs
3 c  Sour cream
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 tb Bourbon or dark rum
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
MAKE THE CRUST: In a food processor or blender, grind the cookies into
moderately fine textured crumbs.  Add the sugar, cinnamon and salt and
process briefly to blend. Transfer to a bowl, pour the butter over the
crumbs and toss with a fork to moisten evenly.  Gently press the
crumbs evenly over the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.
PREPARE THE CHEESECAKE FILLING: Preheat the oven to 350F. In a food
processor, combine the cream cheese, sugar, salt and eggs; blend
until smooth, scraping down the sides of the container as necessary.
Add the sour cream (see note), lemon juice, bourbon, vanilla, butter,
and blend. Pour the filling into the cookie crumb shell and bake in
the middle of the oven for 45 minutes. Turn off the oven, prop the
oven door slightly open and allow the cake to rest in the oven for 1
hour. Cool on a rack and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. Note: If
the container of the food processor is not large enough, add only 1
cup of sour cream. Pour about half the mixture into a mixing bowl;
add the reamining 2 cups of sour cream to the processor and blend.
Combine both batches in the mixing bowl and stir to blend.

"This is the epitome of cheesecakes - you won't find a creamier,
tastier or better one anywhere.  Don't open the door during baking if
you want to keep the top from cracking. Make this cake at least a day
before you want to serve it to allow the flavors to develop."
