Title: THANKSGIVING TILE
Categories: Misc., Holidays, Kids
Yield: 1 Servings
This could be a tile with
A " Thanksgiving "drawing
On it. Something the kids
Can do freehand or looking
At a picture in a coloring
Book or magazine.
These directions are for
Using tracing paper and
Copying a drawing of the
Mayflower.
...................
Here's how to do it................ 1... Follow the preceding
directions on how to make the dough.
With a rolling pin, roll out the clay until it's about 1/4 " thick.
Place a 6" square of cardboard on top of the clay and cut around it
with a butter knife. 2... Now draw the pattern for the Mayflower onto
a piece of tracing paper. Place this pattern on the clay. Pressing
hard with the point of a pencil, draw over the lines on the pattern.
Lift the pattern off and then go over all the lines with the pencil.
Make sure the lines are deep enough so the pattern will stand out
after the tile is baked. 3... To hang your tile, make two holes at
about 1/2 "" from the top. Later, after the tile has been baked and
colored you can push a 12" piece of string through the holes and tie
it to hang.
