Title: THE ULTIMATE CHOCOLATE BROWNIE COOKIE
Categories: Biscuits, Desserts
Yield: 6 Dozen
1 1/3 c  Golden Crisco
1 c  Granulated sugar
2/3 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
1 tb Vanilla
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2/3 c  Cocoa
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Large, broken pecan or
Walnut pieces
1 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Combine Crisco, granulated sugar, brown
sugar and vanilla in large bowl. Beat with electric mixer on low
speed for 1 minute or until creamy. Add beaten eggs. Combine flour,
cocoa, baking soda and salt. Add to creamed mixture alternately with
milk, beating on low speed for about 1 minute, or just until blended.
Stir in nuts and chocolate chips. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls
(about 2T for each cookie) on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 6 to 9 at
a time, leaving about 3 inches between cookies for spreading. Bake
for 10 to 12 minutes. Cookies will appear soft and moist when baked,
but firm up on cooling. Cool 2 minutes, then remove to cooling rack.
Makes about 3 dozen cookies.

Note: Smaller cookies can be made using 1T dough for each cookie. Bake
8-10 minutes. Makes about 6 dozen cookies.
