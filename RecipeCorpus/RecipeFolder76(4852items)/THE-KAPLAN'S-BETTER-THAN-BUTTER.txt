Title: THE KAPLAN'S BETTER THAN BUTTER
Categories: Spreads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pt Lowfat (1-2% milkfat)
-cottage cheese
1/4 c  Water
4 tb Nonfat dry milk
2 pk ButterBuds natural butter
-flavored mix
1    -3 packages Sweet 'n Low
It's easy. Just pour all of above into your blender. Blend on low and
increase speed until smooth. Then pour/scrape mixture back into cheese
container and refrigerate.

You'll never taste the cottage cheese. I use 2 packs of Sweet 'n Low.
Experiment until you love the taste. With just 7 calories per
tablespoon and an almost unmeasurable trace of artery clogging fat
and cholesterol, you'll never want to use cholesterol laden 100
calorie butter or 100 calorie margarine on your bread again.
