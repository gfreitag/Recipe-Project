"Following the example of the prophet Muhammad, Muslims break their
fast with dates every Ramadan evening as the call to prayer echoes
across the desert. In Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, the bedouin
heritage lingers in the dates that are offered as a welcome to
guests, along with a tiny handless cup of green cardamom coffee.
Varieties known as Red Sugar, Bride's Finger, Mother of Perfume, and
Pure Daughter are served whole or stuffed with nuts and other fruits.
Among the multitude of traditional foods prepared from dates are date
syrup and preserves, date bread and doughnuts, puddings, breakfast
porridges, sweet rice, and meat and fish dishes. The date palm has
become a symbol of Arab hospitality and culture and forms part of the
national emblem of Saudi Arabia as well as the symbol of the national
airline, Saudia."

1. Cut apricots into pieces. With oiled hands, knead the pistachios

formed.
