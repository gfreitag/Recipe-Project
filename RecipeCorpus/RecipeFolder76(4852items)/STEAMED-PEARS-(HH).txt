Title: STEAMED PEARS (HH)
Categories: Fruits/nuts, Oriental, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Firm pears
3 tb Sugar
- pref. Chinese rock sugar
1/3 c  Water
2    Pieces Chinese cinnamon bark
-=OR=-  Cinnamon sticks
PEEL THE PEARS and cut them in half. Remove the core and seeds.
Combine the sugar and water in a small pot and boil it until the
sugar has completely dissolved. Allow it to cool slightly. Put the
pears, sugar-water and cinnamon together into a shallow bowl. Set up
a steamer or put a rack into a wok or pan. Add about 2 inches of
water and bring to a boil. Put the bowl of pears into the steamer or
onto the rack, turn the heat down to a simmer and cover the wok or
pot tightly with a lid. Slowly steam the pears for about 15-to-25
minutes, until they are tender. (The cooking time will depend on the
ripeness of the pears.) When the pears are cooked, drain all the
liquid and cinnamon stick or bark into a small saucepan and reduce
the liquid to a syrup by boiling it fast. Remove and discard the
cinnamon stick. Pour the syrup over the pears and serve at once. Or
you can let the mixture cool, cover it with plastic wrap and
refrigerate until you are ready to serve it.
