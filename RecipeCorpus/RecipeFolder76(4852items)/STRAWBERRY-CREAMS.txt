2 c  Strawberries, unsweetened
5    Envelopes unflavored gelatin

1/2 c  Plain yogurt
In food processor or blender, puree strawberries with 1/2 cup water.
To strain out seeds, press through fine sieve into large measuring
cup. Add water if necessary to make 2 cups.

In small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over 1 cup of strained strawberry
juice, let stand 5 minutes to soften. Heat over low heat, stirring
until gelatin dissolves.

Pour remaining strawberry juice into bowl, stir in gelatin mixture.
Stir in sweetener and yogurt until well mixed.

Pour into 8 inch square baking dish.  Let stand 4 hours at room
temperature or until firm.  To remove from pan, cut around edges with
sharp knife. Place dish in shallow pan of hot water for about 30
seconds just to slightly soften bottom.  Loosen one corner, then
