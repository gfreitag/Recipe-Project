Title: STEAMED AMERICAN INDIAN PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 lb Beef suet
Small piece stick cinnamon
Grated rind of one lemon
1 pt Indian meal
1 pt Milk
3    Eggs
1/4 pt Molasses
Chop suet very fine and mix with Indian meal.  Put cinnamon in the
milk; scald in a farina boiler. Strain while mixture is hot and
gradually stir in Indian meal and suet. Add molasses, cover mixture,
and let stand overnight. In the morning, beat the eggs until light;
stir them into the pudding; then turn into a greased mold or well -
floured pudding bag, leaving plenty of room for it to swell. If
mixture is in a mold, cover it; if in a bag, secure it well at the
tying place lest the water get in. Put covered mixture into a pot of
boiling water and boil continuously for five hours. Replenish the
water as it evaporates with boiling water. When ready to serve,
remove the pudding carefully from the mold or bag, and serve
immediately with wine sauce.
