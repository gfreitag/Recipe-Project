Don't add other vegetables to this dish.  Keep it simple. Just be
artful in cutting vegetables.

Preparation:  Slice pork butt across grain, then into strips 1/4"
thick by 2" long.  Marinate with soy sauce, sherry & sugar for 15
minutes. Peel cucumber; slice in half the long way & remove seeds;
slice in strips to match pork; marinate in salt water for 15 minutes.

Stir-frying:  Heat wok until very hot; add 1/2 of oil. Drain pork;
reserve liquid.  When oil just begins to smoke, add pork & stir-fry
rapidly for about 1 minute until shrivelled. Remove pork from wok;
wash wok.

Reheat wok until very hot; add remaining oil.  Drain cucumber. When
oil just begins to smoke, add cucumber and stir-fry rapidly until
heated through - about 30 seconds. Add pork & garlic; stir briefly;
add stock. Bring stock to boil; then stir in enough cornstarch paste
to make a light gravy.  Bring sauce to boil. Serve.
