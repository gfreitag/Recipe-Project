Peel, halve, and core the apples, brushing them with the lemon juice
as they are cored. In a 10 1/4-inch round copper gratin pan., 1 1/2
inches deep, arrange the butter pieces on the bottom and sprinkle
them with the sugar. Arrange the apples, round side down, in 2
concentric circles, overlapping them slightly, in the pan. Cook the
apple mixture over moderately low heat for 30 to 35 minutes, or until

the sugar is a golden brown caramel, transfer it to the middle of a
preheated 400 degree oven, and bake it for 10 to 15 minutes, or until

the apples are just tender. Let the apple mixture cool for 5 minutes.

Arrange the dough over the apple mixture and let it soften just until

the edges can be tucked down between the apples and the side of the
pan. Prick the dough and bake the tart in the middle of the oven for
25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden. Invert a heat-proof
serving plate over the pan and invert the tarte Tatin carefully onto
it. Serve warm with whipped cream.
