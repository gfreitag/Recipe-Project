4    -Trout fillets
Salt and pepper

I call this one Streamside trout because it is so basic that you can
do it along your favorite trout stream on your camp stove. It basic,
also, because you don't have to do too much to trout or any fish when
they are that fresh.

Put salt, pepper and cornmeal in paper bag. Drop trout in bag and
shake vigorously to coat with mixture. Place in hot frying pan and
cook until golden brown.
