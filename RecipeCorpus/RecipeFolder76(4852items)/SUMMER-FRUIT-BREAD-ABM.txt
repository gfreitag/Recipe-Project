Title: SUMMER FRUIT BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Oz
MMMMM----------------BEST BREADMACHINE COOKBK EVE---------------------
1/2 c  Blueberries, frozen
2 1/4 ts Yeast
2 1/4 c  Bread flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Dry milk
1/2 ts Cloves, ground
1/4 ts Cinnamon, ground
1 ts Salt
1 c  Peaches, chopped
1 1/2 tb Butter
1    Eggs
2/3 c  Water
Blackberries may be substituted for the blueberries. Nectarines may be
substituted for the peaches.  If berries are fresh, freeze them
anyway so they will not get too mushy in the bread dough. In some
machines they will stay partially solid; in others, berries will
marbleize the dough.

Bring all ingredients except berries to room temperature and pour into
bakery, in order.  Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white
bread" and push Start.  Add berries at beep.

This sweet, moist bread can go to the beach and is also great on a
sailboat, a cruise, or a race, because it keeps well and does not
make too many crumbs. Bread makes good boat food because you can eat
it with one hand and still have a hand free to take the tiller.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
