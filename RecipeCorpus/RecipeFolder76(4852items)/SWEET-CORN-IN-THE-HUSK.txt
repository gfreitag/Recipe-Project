Prepare the coals for grilling.  Soak the unhusked corn in a large
pot of cold water for 15 minutes. Then peel the husks halfway down
and remove and discard the silk.  Rub the exposed kernels with 2
tablespoons of the butter.  Then replace the husks, and wrap each ear
of corn in a double thickness of aluminum foil. Arrange the corn
directly on moderately hot coals.  Turn them a quarter turn every 10
minutes, and cook for a total of 35 minutes. Carefully remove the
foil and husks, and serve the corn with the remaining butter
alongside. Albuquerque Butter: Combine all ingredients in a small
bowl, and mix well. This will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for
two days.^T
