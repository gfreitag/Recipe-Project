Categories: Vegetables, Cheese
Yield: 12 Servings
1 lb Sweet potatoes,peel & slice
2 tb Unsalted butter (1/4 stick)
1 lb Onions, thinly sliced
3/4 lb Granny Smith apples, peeled
Cored & thin sliced
3 tb Flour
1/2 c  Chicken stock or broth
3/4 c  Fresh breadcrumbs
3/4 c  Cheddar, sharp,coarse grated
6    Lean bacon slices, cooked
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter 13X6 inch oval baking dish. Slice
sweet potatoes into 1/4" thick slices. Melt butter in heavy large
skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute until tender, about 10
minutes. Toss apples with flour in medium bowl. Arrange half of sweet
potatoes in bottom of prepared dish. Top with half of apple slices.
Arrange remaining potatoes and then remaining apples. Cover with
sauteed onions. Pour stock over all. Bake until sweet potatoes are
tender, about 45 minutes. Maintain oven temperature. Mix breadcrumbs,
cheese and bacon (crumbled) in small bowl. Sprinkle mixture over
gratin. Bake an additional 20 minutes. Preheat broiler. Broil until
topping browns. (This has not been necessary any time I have made
this recipe as the oven browns the topping just fine for me). Cool 5
minutes and serve. Substitution: Use Butternut or Acorn squash
instead of the sweet potatoes. Source: Bon Appetit, Dec 1991 issue
