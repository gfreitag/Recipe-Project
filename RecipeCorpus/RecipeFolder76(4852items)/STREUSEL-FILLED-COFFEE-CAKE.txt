Title: STREUSEL-FILLED COFFEE CAKE
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour (I don't sift)
3/4 c  Sugar
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Shortening
3/4 c  Milk
1    Egg
FILLING:
1/2 c  Brown sugar (packed)
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Chopped nuts

This is an extremely easy, light, and delicious coffee cake, that has
been requested by my friends repeatedly. I hope you like it:

CAKE:

Preheat oven to 375.  Grease 8" or 9" square pan. Blend all the cake
ingredients and beat vigorously one-half minute (I do this in my
Kitchen Aid).  Spread half the batter in the prepared pan. Mix the
filling ingredients together. Sprinkle half the mixture over batter
in the pan. Top with the remaining batter, then the remaining brown
sugar mixture. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until cake tests done.

This is in a cookbook entitled "Americas Best Recipes ~ State Fair
Blue Ribbon Winners", and the entrant's name is Sean Pohl.
