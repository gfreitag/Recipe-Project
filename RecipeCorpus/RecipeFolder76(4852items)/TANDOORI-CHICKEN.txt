Peel skin off chicken pieces. Make several cuts into each piece. Wash
off clean with paper towel. Mix vegetable oil, food color, all spices
and onion, if desired into yogurt. Marinate chicken with mixture 4 or
5 hours, overnight for best results. Bake chicken @ 400 degrees 30
minutes. No need to preheat oven. Keep basting with juice
occasionally. If there is excess juice, you may spoon out some. Broil
chicken 2 to 5 minutes toward the end. Sprinkle with Garam Masala.
Garnish with lemon slices and few leaves of cilantro (optional).
