Title: SWEETHEART SANDWICHES
Categories: Cookies, Davidson
Yield: 36 Cookies
MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
1/4 lb Butter, sweet
1 1/4 c  Sugar
2 lg Egg
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Cocoa, unsweetened
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
4 tb Butter, sweet
1 ts Vanilla extract
4 c  Sugar, confectioners'
Whipping cream
To make the cookies, cream the butter with the sugar in a large bowl
until light.  Beat in eggs and vanilla; set aside. Sift the dry
ingredients together; stir thoroughly into the butter mixture. Cover
the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for two or three hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 F. and grease two cookie sheets. Roll level
teaspoons of the dough into balls and place 2" apart on the cookie
sheets. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cookies are puffed and
the surfaces slightly dry and cracked. Cool on wire racks.

To make the filling, cream the butter until light. Beat in the
vanilla and confectioners' sugar, adding the cream and continuing to
beat until the consistency of a creamy frosting.

Once the cookies are completely cooled, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of
filling on the bottom of each cookie, then top with the bottom side of
another cookie.

Variation:  To make half the cookies peppermint-filled, add 1/8
teaspoon peppermint extract to *half* the filling. Tint pink or green
before filling the sandwiches.
