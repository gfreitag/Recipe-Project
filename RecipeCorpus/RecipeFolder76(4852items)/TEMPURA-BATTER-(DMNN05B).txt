Dip food such as shrimp,lobster scallops and vegetables such as
broccoli,pea pods, in batter and dunk in hot oil,fry till lightly
browned. This may sound like a hard appetizer but I heat oil in a pan
till hot,pour into fondue pot and let the guests make their own.They
seem to enjoy doing this. FROM: JEAN RHYNER
