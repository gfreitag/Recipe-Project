Categories: Dessert, Steamed foo
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM---------------------BROWNIED CAKE MIX--------------------------
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon -- opt.
1/3 c  Margarine -- or butter
3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tb Dried buttermilk
1 tb Dried eggs (scrambled egg
Mix) -- beaten
1/2 tb Vanilla sugar
1/4 c  Walnuts -- finely chopped
1/2 c  Water
Needed:  two nestled pots.  The larger pot holds the water to steam
the contents of the smaller pot inside. Both pots need lids or covers
of heavy duty alumimum foil.

Mix the cake ingredients ahead of time  cutting the margarine into
the dry ingredients, and pack in a zip lock bag. Use large enough bag
that it can be used as the mixing container.

Grease the bottom and side of the smaller pot.  Add the water to the
mix and beat by hand till smooth. Stir in nuts. Pour mixture into the
prepared pot. Cover the pot. Put thesmaller pot inside the larger one
and pour hot water up the side about 2/3 or 3/4 of the way up the
side of the inside pot.  Put the lid on and set level on the edge of
the fire so the water simmers and barely boils. Cook for 2 1/2 to 3
hours or till cakes spring back when touched and a long wooden
tooth-pick inserted near the centers comes out clean.
