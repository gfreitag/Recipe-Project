Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 tb Hoisin sauce
2 ts Sesame oil
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Finely grated orange peel
1 1/3 lb Rockfish fillets
8    Spinach leaves, stems
-removed, washed and patted
-dry
4    Lemon wedges
Combine the hoisin sauce, sesame oil, salt and orange peel. Spread on
the fish fillets. Top with the spinach leaves.

Place the fish on a rack set above boiling water. (A roasting pan
fitted with a rectangular cake rack, set above the water can be used
for this purpose. Or use a bamboo steamer.) Cover with foil and steam
12 minutes per inch of thickness, or until the fish tests done (140
degrees on an instant read thermometer).

Serve with the lemon wedges.

Note: The same type of cooking preparation can be used for steaming
the fish simply with a little soy sauce, a sprinkling of orange or
lemon juice, and thinly sliced green onions.
