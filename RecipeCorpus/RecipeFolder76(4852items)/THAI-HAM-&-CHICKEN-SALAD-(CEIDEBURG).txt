MMMMM-------------------------DRESSINGS------------------------------
1/2    Chinese cabbage, shredded
2    Carrots, grated
1    Capsicum pepper, cut into
Thin strips
2/3 lb Cooked chicken meat,
Shredded
3 1/2 oz Ham, finely sliced
1    Birdseye chilli, finely
Chopped
2 cl Garlic crushed
2 tb Lime (or lemon), juice
2 tb Dark soya sauce
1/2 c  Flaked almonds, lightly
-Toasted
Bring a large pot of water to the boil and have ready a sink full
of icey-cold water. Plunge the shredded cabbage into the boiling
water for one minute then scoop it out and into the cold water.

Drain and dry the cabbage and arrange it and the other vegetables
in sections or concentric rings for maximum decorative value on a
large serving dish. Fill the centre of the arrangement with chicken
and ham. Decorate the dish with bright red chilli "flowers"
(optional). Pass the dressing separately.

[The chilli "flowers" can be easily made by slitting long, thin,
hot chillies lengthwise from near where the stem attaches and then
tossing the slit chillies into a bowl of ice water and ice cubes. The
"petals" will curl back and make an attractive garnish. Make about
eight slits. S.C.]
