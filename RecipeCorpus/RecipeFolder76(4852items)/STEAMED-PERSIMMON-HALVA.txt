Title: STEAMED PERSIMMON HALVA
Categories: Candies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Butter, clarified
2 ts Cardamom, ground
1 c  Sugar, brown
2 c  Persimmon pulp
1 ts Juice, lemon
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
Vegetable oil can be substituted for the clarified butter.

In a large bowl, mix the flower, sugar and soda.  Fold in the pulp
and the ghee.  Add the lemon juice, cardamom powder, raisins and
nuts. Stir to combine all the ingredients.

Coat with ghee or oil a six-cup container and pour the mixture into
it. Cover with foil and steam in the pressure cooker without its
valve weight for about 1 hours. Cool the halva before cutting into
small pieces for serving.

A pressure cooker with a six-cup size container works best for this
recipe. One large persimmon equals about
1    cup of pulp.
