1 tb Chinese salted and fermented

1    Inch lump fresh ginger,
-peeled, minced
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
2 tb Peanut or corn oil

1/4 c  Chicken stock
1 ts Cornstarch mixed with 1

Scrub clams and rinse well with cold water. Discard any that do not
shut quickly or have broken shells. Keep refrigerated in a bowl
covered with a damp towel until ready to cook. Soak the black beans
in lukewarm water to cover for 5 minutes. Rinse with fresh water and
transfer to a small bowl with the ginger and garlic. Using the back
of a fork, gently mash the mixture into a coarse paste; set aside.

Place a wok over high heat. When hot, add the oil, then the black bean
paste, chiles and green onions; stir rapidly until fragrant, about 15
seconds. Add clams and stir-fry for 1 minute. Season with sugar and
white pepper. Splash in the rice wine and toss together for a few
seconds.

Add soy sauce and chicken stock, cover, reduce heat to medium-high and
simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or until clams open.

Pour cornstarch mixture into the center of the wok. Stir continuously
until sauce thickens to a creamy glaze. Drizzle in the sesame oil.

Serve with steamed rice.
