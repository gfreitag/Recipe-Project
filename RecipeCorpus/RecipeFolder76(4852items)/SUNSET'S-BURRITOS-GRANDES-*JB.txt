Title: SUNSET'S BURRITOS GRANDES *JB
Categories: Main dish, Mexican
Yield: 4 Servings
2 oz Dried ancho, New Mexico or
--California chilies (4-6)
1/3 c  Tequila
1/4 c  Lemon juice
3    Garlic cloves
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1 ts Salt
1 1/4 lb Pork butt (shoulder) trimmed
1/2 c  Long-grain white rice
1/4 c  Canned tomato sauce
1 cn (15 oz.) pinto or red beans
4 lg Or 6 regular flour tortillas
1 1/4 c  Guacamole
1/3 c  Sour cream
1 c  Crumbled cotija cheese or
--shredded jack cheese
1 2/3 c  Red salsa
1/2 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
Tequila-chili marinade:  Stem and seed chilies.  Whirl in a blender
until finely ground.  Add tequila, lemon juice, 1/4 c water, garlic,
oil, oregano, and 3/4 t salt; whirl until pureed. Cut meat across the
grain into 1/2" thick slices 3-4" long.  In a bowl, coat meat with
marinade. Chill airtight 15 min. to 24 hours.

On a large baking sheet, lay parallel about 2 inches apart 2 metal
skewers, each about 18 inches long. Lift meat from marinade and
thread each strip onto a pair of skewers. Pat with marinade from bowl.

Place skewered meat on an oiled barbecue grill over med-high heat
(close lid on gas grill).  Cook, turning often, until meat is well
browned and crusty, about 20 minutes.

Spanish rice:  Meanwhile, in a 1 1/2-2 qt. pan over high heat, bring
3/4 c water, rice, tomato sauce and remaining 1/4 t salt to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until liquid is absorbed; 15-20
minutes.

Beans:  About 5 minutes before meat is done, place beans and their
liquid in a 1 qt pan and cook over med-high heat until bubbling,
about 5 minutes.

Tortillas:  Lift cooked meat to a platter and cover with foil. Heat 1
or 2 tortillas at a time on grill until lightly browned but still
soft, turning once, 30-40 secs. Stack on platter beneath foil to keep
warm.

Assembly:  On a board, remove meat from skewers, cut into 1/4" wide
strips. Lay tortillas flat.  Toward one edge of each, fill equally
with guacamole, sour cream, pork, beans (including most of the
liquid), rice, cheese, 1 c. salsa, and cilantro.  Fold over sides and
roll up tightly to enclose. Add more salsa to taste.
