1 c  Sun-dried tomatoes in oil
3/4 c  Cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 c  Walnut pieces
2 lg Garlic cloves; halved
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/3 c  Warm olive oil
To make 2 cups of pesto:  Position knife blade in food processor
bowl; add tomatoes, and pulse 2 or 3 times or until tomatoes are
chopped. Add Parmesan cheese and next 4 ingredients. Top with cover
and process until smooth.  With processor running, pour warm oil
through food chute in a slow, steady stream, processing until
combined. Use immediately, or place in an airtight container, and
refrigerate up to 1 week. Serve over hot pasta.

Suggested uses for tomato pesto:
o  Stir 1/4 cup pesto into one 8-oz. carton of sour cream for an
instant dip for vegetables.
o  Try pesto as an omelet filling.  Spoon about 2 tablespoons of
the
sauce over half of a three-egg omelet; fold omelet over, and
serve.
o  Stir 3 tablespoons pesto into 1/2 cup softened unsalted butter.
Serve the pesto butter as a bread spread, or toss it with hot
vegetables.
