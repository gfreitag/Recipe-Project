The first step in this recipe is to make the carrot paste:

(This carrot paste recipe makes enough for use with several meals. The
mixture freezes well.)

2    large onions or leeks 2 teaspoons of olive oil (optional)
1 bag of carrots, cut into thin rounds
4    cloves of garlic, diced stock granules (amount that would
normally go with 2 cups of water) (I used WeightWatchers ff Chicken
Broth) 1 packet of Butter Buds optional: ~ white wine pepper to season

Saute onions/leeks in olive oil.  Add other ingredients, and then add
some water--enough to just cover carrots with the liquid. Simmer
about 45 minutes to an hour, stirring every 10-15 minutes -- adding
liquid as nesc. to stop burning.   When carrots are tender, and break
apart easily, turn off heat and let cool long enough to transfer to a
food processor.

Process in parts until all is a pureed paste.

Divide into 4 parts.  Save out one of these for use and put the other
parts in the freezer.

(The original poster mentioned using this carrot paste diluted with
evaporated skim milk to make a pasta sauce.)

Now that the carrot paste is done, here's the rest of the recipe:

1    medium onion, sliced 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
1 1/2    tsp. paprika
1/2    tsp. cayenne
1    tsp. dill weed
12    oz. fresh sliced mushrooms ~ veggies

Saute (veggies) with onion and garlic.  Add spices and mushrooms.

Mix together and pour in:
2    cups non-fat milk
1/3    cup flour 1 packet of stock granules (or about 2 teaspoons)
carrot paste

Simmer 5 or 10 minutes until mushrooms and onions are cooked and
mixture is thickened. Add salt and pepper to your taste. Stir
frequently.

Serve over noodles of your choice.
