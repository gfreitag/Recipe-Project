PASTA POT - cook pasta until al dente. Drain well. Toss with butter
flavored canola. LARGE SKILLET or WOK ~ Fry prosciutto or bacon until
crisp; add a little olive oil, as needed, to prevent sticking.

Option #1:  Combine the herb(s), radicchio, cheese, pepper and meat
in a serving bowl and toss. Add hot "buttered" pasta and toss.
Distribute servings to heated bowls. Top with cheese.

Option #2:  Push meat aside in the wok or skillet and stir fry
radicchio and herbs for about 3 minutes, until just wilted and the
"cranberry" color darkens ("maroon"). Add the pasta to the wok. Toss.
Salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a heated serving bowl. Top with
cheese: some shavings, some grated.

VARIATIONS:  __Any long stranded pasta.  __Harlequin pasta: plain,
beet and spinach.  __Equal amounts of linguine and angel hair. Note
the different cooking times on package. __Shorten the pasta: break
length in two. __Equal amounts of fresh basil, or lemon basil and
fresh tarragon. __Good quality turkey bacon instead of prosciutto.
Cut bacon into squarish pieces; then fry. [patH at mcRecipe 30 Au 96]
