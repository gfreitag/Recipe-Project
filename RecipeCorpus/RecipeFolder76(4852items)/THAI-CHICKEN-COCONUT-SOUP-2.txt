Title: THAI CHICKEN COCONUT SOUP 2
Categories: Main dish, Thai
Yield: 1 Servings
-=========================
Ingredients:

3-4 cans  coconut milk (make sure it's the unsweetened kind) 3 tblsp
chopped scallions 1-3 tsp lemon grass cilantro (preferably fresh. I
sometimes leave this out. Niels says that's defeating the whole
point, but I think it still comes out great) tofu cubed into smallish
pieces. chicken also cubed to bite size. mushrooms 1 carrot grated
juice from loads of limes (8? i can never put in enough) serrano
chillies (or any other hot chili pepper, again preferably fresh, but
powdered will do) 1 tsp galanga powder Heat the coconut milk in a
pot. Add everything else. As the lemon grass is inedible, put it in a
tea ball and immerse the ball in the soup so you can retrieve it
later. Cook until the chicken is done and the soup is hot (30
minutes?).  Taste to see if it needs more limes (it always does) or
more hot peppers (it's better to start mild and build up to the
desired level of spicyness).
