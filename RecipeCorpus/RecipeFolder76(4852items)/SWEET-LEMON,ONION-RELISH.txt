2 tb Olive oil
2 md Onions
-- cut in thin 1/4" strips
2 md Lemons
2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 c  ;Water

Heat oil in a medium skillet and add onions; cook covered on very low
heat until onions are soft but not brown, stirring occasionally, for
about 15 minutes.

While onions are cooking, prepare the lemons:  Squeeze juice from the
lemons and reserve.  Cut the rinds into 1/4" strips. Put in a small
pan and cover with cold water; bring to a boil, then pour out the
water. Repeat, boiling up the rind for a total of 3 times.

When the onions are tender, add the drained lemon strips, lemon juice,
water, sugar, salt and thyme. Cook uncovered over low heat, stirring
occasionally, for about 20 minutes until most of the liquid is
reduced and onions and lemons are glazed.

Put up in glass jars.  Store in refrigerator.

Yield: 1 3/4 cups.

Shepherd writes: "Meltingly delicious with baked ham, lamb or chicken
and a special treat to replace or share the spotlight with cranberry
sauce for Thanksgiving turkey dinner."
