Title: STUFFED STEAK
Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Slices bacon
1/2 c  Mushrooms, sliced thin
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 1/4 c  Water
1/4 ts Basil
1 c  Stuffing mix
1 tb Oil
1    10.5 oz can mushroom gravy

1    Stalk celery
1/4 c  Wild rice or regular rice
1/2 ts Beef bouillon

In a medium skillet, cook bacon over medium low heat for 5-8
minutes, until crisp.  Drain, reserving 1 Tbsp fat. Crumble bacon and
set aside.
Add onion, mushrooms, celery and garlic to skillet; saute 5
minutes or until tender.  Add rice, 1 cup of the water, bouillon,
basil and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes
or until tender (broth will not be completely absorbed). Remove from
heat and stir in stuffing mix.  Stir in bacon and parsley; set
stuffing aside.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Cook steaks
for 2-3 minutes on each side, until browned. Drain any fat from
skillet. Stir together the gravy and remaining 1/4 cup of water; pour
over the steaks. Place 1/4 of the stuffing over each steak. Reduce
heat, cover and simmer about 20 minutes, until steaks are tender.
Garnish with cherry tomatoes
