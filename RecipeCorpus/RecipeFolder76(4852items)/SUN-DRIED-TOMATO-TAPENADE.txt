1 pk Sun-dried Tomatoes-3oz
Boiling Water
1 c  Olive Oil
1 tb Drained Capers-Rounded T
2 ts Minced Garlic
1 ts Finely Grated Lemon Zest
1 ts Fresh Lemon Juice
1/2 ts Herbes de Provence
Place the tomatoes in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside
until softened, about 2 minutes. Drain and pat dry. When cool, place
in a jar, cover with the olive oil and set aside at room temperature
for 1 week. Pick the tomatoes out of the jar, leaving plenty of oil
on them. Reserve the remaining oil. In a processor, combine the
tomatoes with the capers, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and herbs.
Pulse until a very coarse, rough puree forms, adding some of the
reserved oil, if necessary. Season to taste with salt.
