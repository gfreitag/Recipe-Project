Cooking time: 40 min.

1. Trim pork of any excess fat. Combine salt, cinnamon, cloves, and
flour on a piece of wax paper. Press chops into mixture, coating them
on both sides.

2. In a 10-inch skillet with a nonstick surface brown chops in 1 1/2
Tbl. butter over medium heat, about 2 minutes on first side. Turn
chops and add onion to skillet around pork. Cook 2 minutes.

3. Sprinkle pork with sugar, then lemon juice. Spoon most of the
onion over the pork. Turn heat to low, add water around chops, cover
and simmer 40 minutes. Spoon pan juices over pork halfway through
cooking.

4. Peel peach(es) and slice thickly. Melt butter in a 7-inch skillet
and coat slices with butter to prevent darkening.

5. When pork is done, heat peach slices about 3 minutes, just until
hot. Place pork on a small platter and spoon pan juices on top.
Arrange peach slices in a row over chops and top with a dollop of
sour cream.

*Peaches are most readily available from June to September. Frozen
unsweetened peach slices are available through a longer season and
are a good substitute in this recipe. (Use about 10 peach slices.)

To do ahead: Prepare through Step 5 up to 20 minutes ahead. Cover and
leave at room temperature. Reheat pork and complete Step 5.

Note: When this dish is cooking it may smell overspiced at first, but
don't worry, the resulting flavor is subtle and pleasing.
