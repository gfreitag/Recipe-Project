Title: STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE 2
Categories: Fruits, Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/3 c  Plus 3T Brown Sugar (packed)
3/4 c  Low-fat Milk
3/4 c  Unbleached White Flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Butter, melted
*
1 pt Strawberries
* Sweet, ripe strawberries, hulled and crushed Heavy Cream (optional)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' '' Preheat
oven to 400 deg F. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking
powder, and salt. In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with
the melted butter until it dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine
the wet with the dry ingredients and work together to form a soft
dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead for a
minute or so. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, form into smooth
balls, and roll out to to fit the bottom of a pie pan. Place the
rounds of dough in 2 lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for 12-15 minutes,
or until dough is golden brown. In the meantime, combine the crushed
strawberries with the remaining 3 T sugar in a small bowl. Cover
until ready to use. Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just
warm to the touch. Place 1 round on a serving plate, spread it with
the berries, and top with the other round of dough. Cut into wedges
to serve; this is best served fresh and warm. Top each serving with a
bit of cold, stiffly beaten heavy cream if you'd like.
