Title: SPINACH DIP (LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1    16 oz container of ff sour
Cream
1 pk Ff cream cheese
1    10 oz pkg of frozen spinach
1    Envelope onion soup mix
1/4 c  Water chestnuts, chopped
1/4 c  Red onion, chopped
Thaw spinach and squeeze out moisture.  In a large bowl, combine all
ingredients.  Chill and serve with pitas or crackers.

This dip looks great served in a hollowed-out loaf of brown bread.

Another variation is to substitute an envelope of spring vegetable
soupmix.

You can eat it right away, but it tastes better after chilling awhile.

grocery.
