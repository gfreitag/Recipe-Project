pork is crispy and dry, about 4 minutes, remove it with a slotted
spoon and drain on paper towels. Pour off the oil, leaving 2
tablespoons in the wok. Reheat the wok and add the garlic, ginger and
scallions, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Then add the sesame paste,
soy sauce, chili oil, salt and chicken stock and simmer for 4
minutes. Cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 2
minutes if they are fresh or 5 minutes if they are dried. Drain the
noodles well in a colander. Divide them into individual bowls or put
in large soup tureen. Ladle on the sauce.
