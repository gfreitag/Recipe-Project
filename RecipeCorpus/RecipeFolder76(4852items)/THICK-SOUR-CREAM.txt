Many recipes from central Mexico call for cream. it should be
slightly sour, liek the creme fraiche of France. I suggest that you
make your own, which is far more satisfactory that using the
commercial brands.

Put the cream and buttermilk into a glass jar and mix them well
together.

Cover with plastic wrap and set the mixture aside in a warm place,
but not too warm (a strong pilot light is too warm; the cream will
taste "cooked" and a skin will form) until it is set, about 6 hours.
Put the crem into the refrigerator overnight; it will thicken and
become more solid.

Some creams will sour more quickly, and some become thicker than
others. The milk experts inform me that these are uncontrollable
factors depending on the culture of the buttermilk, the amount of
light and heat to which the cream was exposed before it was used, and
even the bateria in one's own kitchen.

For Thin Sour Cream you can substitute light for heavy cream.
