Preheat the oven to gas mark 6/400F/200C. Peel and wrap the onions in
foil and bake for 45 minutes, or until soft. Blanch the carrots and
french beans in salted boiling water until cooked but still crunchy.
Heat half an ounce of the butter in a frying pan, sprinkle over the
sugar, and saute the button onions until browned and well coated with
the caramel. Add the blanched vegetables and courgettes, coat with
the caramel for two minutes, season with salt and pepper, and keep
warm.

In a saucepan heat the shallots, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns,
white wine and double cream, and reduce by half. Remove from heat and
whisk in the butter, strain and season to taste.

Remove the heart from the onions, stuff with a selection of
vegetables and arrange the remainder around the plate. Pour over the
sauce, scatter the cherry tomatoes, sprinkle over the parsley and
serve.
