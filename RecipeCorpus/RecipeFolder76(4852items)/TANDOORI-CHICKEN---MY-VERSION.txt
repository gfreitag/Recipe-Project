Make the marinade first.  Put the chopped onions, garlic, ginger,
and lemon juice in an electric blender and blend to a smooth paste.
Place this in a bowl large enough to accommodate the chicken. Add the
yogurt, coriander, cumin, turmeric, garam masala,m mace, nutmeg,
cloves, cinnamon, olive oil, salt, black pepper, and cayenn. Mix
thouroughly.
Skin chicken legs and breasts.  With a sharp knife make 3 diagonal
slashes on each breast section, going halfway down to the bone. Make 2
diagonal slashes on each thigh halfway to the bone. Make 4 or 5 jabs
on each drumstick.
Put the chicken in the marinade and rub the marinade into the
slashes with your finger.  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours,
turning 4 or 5 times.
About 1 1/2 hours before serving, light charcoal.
Peel onion for garnishing and slice paper-thin. Separate rings
into ice water and chill.
Grill chicken 7 or 8 minutes on each side, then raise the grill
and cook another 15 to 20 minutes on each side. Baste with marinade
as you cook.
Warm a large platter.  Place chicken pieces on platter - drain
onion rings and lay on top.  Quarter lemons lengthwise and place them
around chicken - the chicken is good with extra lemon juice squeezed
on.
