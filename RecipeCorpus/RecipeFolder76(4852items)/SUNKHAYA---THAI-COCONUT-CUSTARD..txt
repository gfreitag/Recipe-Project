Title: SUNKHAYA - THAI COCONUT CUSTARD.
Categories: Desserts, Thai
Yield: 1 Serving
1 c  Coconut Milk
3/4 c  Palm Sugar
1/2 c  Sugar
4 ea Eggs
1 ts Vanilla Extract (Optional)
Put coconut milk in a medium size bowl.  Add all ingredients and whisk
lightly until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Note:
Traditionally, the mixing is done by hand mixing everything together
and crushing in pieces of banana leave, or the leave of an aromatic
plant (bai-tey). The leaves are then picked out and discarded. Here,
vanilla extract is used in place of the aromatic "bai-tey". The aroma
is not the same, but they both will serve to hide the "raw" taste of
the eggs. Divide the mixture into suitable containers and steam for
approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Suitable container may be simply
glass bowls, or hollowed out small pumpkins, or young "green" coconut
with the top of the shell removed.
