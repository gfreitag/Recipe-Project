Title: SWEET TOMATO PICKLE
Categories: Vegetables, Relishes
Yield: 6 Servings
8 qt Green Tomatoes; 10 lb
2 qt Medium Onions; Sliced
1 c  Salt
1 qt Vinegar
4 c  Granulated Sugar
6 tb Mixed Pickling Spice
Wash and cut the tomatoes and onions into 1/8-inch slices. Place in a
large bowl and sprinkle with the salt. Cover with a large plate and
place a heavy weight, such as a clean stone, on top of the plate to
hold it down. Let stand overnight and wash and drain the tomato
mixture 3 times on cold water.  Place in a kettle and add the vinegar
and sugar. Tie the mixed pickling spices in a cheesecloth bag and
add.  Simmer, uncovered, until the tomatoes and onions are tender,
about 5 minutes. After removing the spice bag, pour at once into
clean, hot, sterilized jars and seal as the jar or lid manufacturer
directs.
