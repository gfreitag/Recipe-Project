Title: SWEET POTATO BISCUITS (ATLAS)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 16 Servings
1 1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Margarine
1/3 c  Apple juice
1 c  Well mashed, cooked sweet
-- potato
3 tb Honey
1/3 c  Finely chopped walnuts or
-- pecans
Preheat oven to 425F.

In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder & salt.
Work in the margarine till the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.
Add apple juice, potato, honey & nuts & work till it resembles a soft
dough.

Turn dough out onto a well-floured board & knead enough extra flour
to make the dough lose its stickiness. With floured hands, divide
dough into 16 equal parts.  Shape into small balls & arrange on a
lightly oiled cookie sheet, patting them down a bit to flatten them.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Serve hot with Creamy Mushroom Soup.
