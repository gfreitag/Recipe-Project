1/2 c  Bulghur

Place the bulghur in a bowl or pan and pour in enough cold water to
cover it completely.  Let it soak for about 10 minutes, then drain in
a sieve or colander lined with a double thickness of dampened
cheesecloth. Wrap the burghul in the cheesecloth and squeeze it
vigorously until completely dry. Drop the bulghur into a deep bowl,
add the tomatoes, parsley, onions, lemon juice and salt and toss
gently but thoroughly together with a fork. Just before serving, stir
in the olive oil and mint and taste for seasoning. Mound the salad in
a serving bowl or spoon it onto romaine lettuce leaves.
