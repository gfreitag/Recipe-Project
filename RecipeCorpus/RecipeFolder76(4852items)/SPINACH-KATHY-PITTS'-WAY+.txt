Title: SPINACH KATHY PITTS' WAY+
Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
1 lb Spinach, washed, stems
-removed (still wet)
1    Clove garlic, minced
2 tb Olive oil
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
Tear the larger leaves in two. Wash well to get rid of any grit.(There
should still be quite a lot of water clinging to the leaves.

Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan (that has a lid.) When the
oil is hot, toss in a clove or two of the minced garlic, and then the
spinach. cover, and occasionally pick up the pan and shake it (as if
with popcorn.) Do this for 3-4 minutes and the spinach will be
wilted, tender and well seasoned (you can add some salt and pepper if
you wish.) Serve immediately.
