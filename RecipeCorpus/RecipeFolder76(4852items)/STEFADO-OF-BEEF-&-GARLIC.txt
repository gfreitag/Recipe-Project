Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a heavy pot that can be covered,
combine all the ingredients except the feta, walnuts and 1/2 cup
parsley. Cover tightly and bake for 1 1/2 hours or more, until the
meat is very tender. Lower the oven temperature during this time, so
that the contents of the pot remain at a gentle simmer.  Skim off the
fat. Do not boil the sacue down; it should remain rather thin. Ladle
the stew into a deep platter. Granish with feta, walnuts, and the
remaining parsley.
