Soak the beans in a large heavy pot covered by at least 3 inches of
water for at least 4 hours.
Add the rest of the ingredients.  Bring to a boil over high heat.
Skim off any foam.
Reduce the heat and gently simmer the beans, uncovered, until
tender, 1 to 1-1/4 hours.  Add water to keep beans submerged.
Season with salt and pepper during last 10 minutes of cooking.
Drain the beans and rinse with cold water. Remove and discard the
vegetable and the bouquet garni.  Pour over cooked rice.
The secret to keeping black beans black is to cook them in the
water in which they've soaked.  Enjoy! From Culinary World Tour Page
