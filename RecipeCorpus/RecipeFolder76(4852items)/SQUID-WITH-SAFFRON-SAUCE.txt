Rice and a green vegetable go with this dish. 1. Clean the squid and
chop the tentacles. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the
onion and garlic until soft but not brown. Add the tentacles and cook
for 5 minutes. 2. In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, Parmesan,
ham, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley. Add the tentacles and
mix thoroughly. 3. Stuff the squid with the mixture and close the
openings securely with a toothpick. 4. Make the sauce. Heat the oil
in a heavy fireproof casserole or frying pan that will hold the squid
comfortably in one layer. Saute the onion and garlic until they are
soft. Add the stuffed squid and the remaining ingredients, except the
parsley. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes, basting the squid with the
sauce, if necessary. 5. Uncover the squid and cook for 35 minutes
longer. Correct the seasoning and baste frequently. Remove the bay
leaf, sprinkle the squid with the parsley, and serve. From: JUDY
