-8 to 10 oz., cut 1 to 1-1/2
-inch thick), fat trimmed
1/2 c  Tequila
2 tb Olive oil

With a damp paper towel, wipe steaks; put meat in a 1- gallon plastic
food bag. Add tequila, oil, pepper, lemon peel, and garlic; seal bag,
and turn to mix seasonings. Set bag in a bowl; chill at least 1 hour
or up to 1 day; turn bag over occasionally. Drain steaks and place on
a grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold
your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds, or set gas barbecue at
this heat). Turn steaks to brown evenly; for medium-rare (cut to
test), cook 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer meat to plates; season to
taste with salt. Serves 4.
