3/8-inch on a side.

Brown meat in frying pan or wok, use oil if necessary. Drain pineapple
juice from canned pineapple into a measuring cup and add water if
necessary to get correct amount of liquid. Add this to fry pan or
wok. Stir in brown gravy mix, vinegar and ginger. Add pineapple and
green pepper. Simmer about 10 minutes, just until liquid begins to
