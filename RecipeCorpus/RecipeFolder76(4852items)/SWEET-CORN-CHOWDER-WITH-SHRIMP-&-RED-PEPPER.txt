Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
1 lg Yellow onion, finely chopped
1 lg Potato, peeled and diced
1    Bay leave
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1 3/4 c  Chicken stock

Heat the oil for 1 minute in a large saucepan over moderate heat. Add
the onion and saute, stirring until limp, about 5 minutes. Add the

Lower the heat to moderate, cover, and cook at a gentle boil until

corn, corn kernels, milk, and black pepper, and bring to a rapid
boil. Lower the heat to moderate, add the red peppers and shrimp, and
boil gently, uncovered, until the shrimp are just cooked through,
about 3 minutes.
