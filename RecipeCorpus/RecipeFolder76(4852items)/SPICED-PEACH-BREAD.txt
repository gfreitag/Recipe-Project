Title: SPICED PEACH BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Starter
1 1/2 c  Cold water
1 1/2 c  White flour
1 1/2 c  Syrup from commercial or
-home-canned spiced peaches
6 oz Box peach flavored gelatin
1/2 c  Warm water
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Ginger
1 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Dried skim milk powder
3 c  White flour
1/2 ts Yellow food coloring (if
-desired)
1/2 c  Soft butter
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 1/2 c  White flour
Empty starter from glass jar into large mixing bowl. Add 1-1/2 cups
cold water and 1-1/2 cups flour.  Beat thoroughly. Cover tightly and
set in a warm place overnight.

In the morning stir the starter thoroughly.  Pour off 2 cups and set
aside. Pour remaining 2 cups into glass jar, cover and return to
refrigerator. Heat 1-1/2 cups spiced peach syrup. Dissolve 1 large
box peach gelatin in it and cool to just warm.  Mix 1/2 cup warm
water, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1 pkg. dry yeast. Set in
warm place until foaming nicely. Pour the 2 cups of reserved starter
into mixing bowl. Add the peach syrup and gelatin, 1 cup dried skim
milk, 3 cups white flour and 1/2 tsp. yellow coloring (the bread will
have a rather dull cream color without it). Beat thoroughly.  Add the
dry yeast mixture as soon as ready and beat again. Add 1/2 cup soft
butter, 1-1/2 tsp. salt and 2-1/2 cups white flour. Stir until the
dough clears the bowl. Spread the remaining 1 cup flour on pastry
board.  Turn out dough (it will be very soft) and knead thoroughly
using a little more flour if necessary to make a smooth, non sticky
dough. Return to the bowl, brush top of dough with butter, cover and
set in warm place to rise (this dough is rather slow so give it
plenty of time). When light, turn out, knead well, divide and shape
as desired. Place in buttered pans, brush tops with butter, cover and
set in warm place until light. Bake in oven preheated to 350 degrees
for about 45 minutes for loaves, 25 minutes for rolls. This recipe
makes 4 high, well-rounded small loaves.
