Title: TALLAHASSEE CHICKEN SALAD (FLORIDA COOKING)
Categories: Poultry, Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Poached Chicken thighs and-
-breasts, poached. See note
1 c  Celery, diced.
Half a 93/8-ounce jar chow-
-chow
Dash hot pepper sauce
1/3 c  Mayonnaise, or as needed to-
-moisten
Garden or Boston lettuce
In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the chicken, celery, chowchow,
and pepper sauce.  Mix lightly; add the mayonnaise and mix again. Add
more mayonnaise if needed to moisten well. Chill 1 to 2 hours before
serving. Line a bowl or platter with greens and spoon the salad onto
the greens.

NOTE:  To poach chicken: Combine 1 pound each of skinned chicken
thighs and breast pices in a large skillet with a carrot, peeled and
sliced; a rib of celery, cut in chuinks; a small onion, cut in halves
but not peeled; pepper, a sprig or two of parsley, and a lemon half.
Cover, and simmer 30 to 45 minutes, until juices run clear or golden
when the chicken is pierced with a fork.  Cool the chicken in the
broth. Cut meat off the bone and chop it coarsely. Refrigerate until
ready to make the salad. If desired, the broth should be saved for
soups or other uses.
