Title: SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK SUBSTITUTE
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 14 Servings
COOK'S ILLUSTRATED 1/12/94
1 1/2 c  Milk powder
1/2 c  Whole or 2 percent milk
2/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
To make fourteen ounces of sweetened condensed milk substitute, whisk
one and one half cups of milk powder into a half cup of whole or 2
percent milk in a saucepan until it is very smooth, about one
minutes. Then whisk in two-thirds cup of sugar and one teaspoon of
vanilla extract, and cook over low heat, continuing to whisk
constantly until the sugar and milk powder dissolve, about five
minutes. Cool before using, then whisk again to be sure that no
graininess remains. (This can be covered and refrigerated for up to
one week.)
