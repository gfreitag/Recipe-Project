Title: SUPER BUBBLE MIXTURE
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Dish liquid (Joy is best)
6 c  Warm water
3/4 c  Corn Syrup (light)
Mix and shake.  Let settle at least 4 hours. Best to use within
a day or two. If you need to store it longer, cover tightly and store
in the fridge.  Use this mixture with those big bubble wands! I pour
the mixture in a roasting pan and dip the wands in it. Don't swish
the wands in the liquid too much because it will make the bubbles
funny. This recipe
