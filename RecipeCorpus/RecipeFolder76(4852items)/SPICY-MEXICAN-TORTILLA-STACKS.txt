Preheat oven 425". Combine beans and corn in large bowl. Stir in
chilies, onion and green pepper. Lay one tortilla at the bottom of a
greased two-quart souffle or casserole dish. Spoon a small amount of
bean mixture over tortilla. Top with equal amounts of Moterey Jack
and cheddar cheese. Continue alternating layers of tortilla, bean
mixture and cheese mixture until you end with cheese layer. Bake
covered at 425" for 10 minutes. Serve with salsa.
