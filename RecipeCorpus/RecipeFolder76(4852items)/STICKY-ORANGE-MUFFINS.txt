Title: STICKY ORANGE MUFFINS
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 12 Servings
2    Oranges
1/4 c  Honey
2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Uncooked oatmeal
-(not instant)
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Sugar
2    Eggs; slightly beaten
2/3 c  Milk
5 1/2 tb Butter; melted
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Either grease the muffin pans or line them with
paper baking cups. Using the small side of the grater, grate the rind
from the oranges, removing only the bright orange part, and set
aside. With a small, sharp knife, remove all the remaining peel and,
if necessary, trim the oranges all around so that the slices will fit
into the bottom of your muffin pans. Cut the oranges into slices
about 1/4-inch thick, pick out all the seeds and set the slices
aside. Put about 1 teaspoon honey in the bottom of each muffin cup,
and place an orange slice on top. Combine the flour, oatmeal, baking
powder, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl, and stir with a fork
or wire whisk to mix. Add the reserved grated orange rind, the eggs,
milk, and melted butter, and stir just until mixed. Spoon the batter
over the orange slices, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Bake for
15-to-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a
muffin comes out clean. Remove from the oven and serve warm.
