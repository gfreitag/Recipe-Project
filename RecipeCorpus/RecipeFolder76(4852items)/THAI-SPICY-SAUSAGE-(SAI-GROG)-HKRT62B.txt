into casing using a teaspoon. Close ends tie every 5" along the
filled casing. Before grilling, make a small pinhole on either side
of the sausage. This is to ensure that the sausage doesn't burst when
being cooked. Grill on the bar-b-que grill outside on in an oven
broiler. Cook until brown and juicy. Serve hot with cooked sticky
rice or warm cooked rice. From Sopit Merrill.
