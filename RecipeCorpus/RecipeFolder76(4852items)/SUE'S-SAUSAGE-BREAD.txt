Thaw bread enough to divide each loaf in half.  Coat loaves with 2
tbsp. softened butter or margarine and let rise in a warm place for 1
hour. Combine remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Roll each half
loaf into a 9 x 12 inch rectangle and brush with remaining softened
butter. Divide sausage mixture into 6 equal parts, and spread
lenghtwise in center of each half loaf. Moisten edges of bread with
water and pinch and pull together to seal.  Put seam sides down about
3 inches apart on cookie sheets. Butter tops and let rise for 30
minutes. Bake at 350~ for 25 minutes or until golden brown.
