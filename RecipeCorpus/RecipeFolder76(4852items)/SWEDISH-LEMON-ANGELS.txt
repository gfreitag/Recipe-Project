Title: SWEDISH LEMON ANGELS
Categories: Humor, Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Egg
1/2 c  Buttermilk (or 1/4 c. milk a
-nd 1/4 cup vinegar
5 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 c  Lemon juice (fresh is best)
1 1/4 c  Sugar
7/8 c  All purpose flour
8 tb Butter or margarine, melted
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375 DEGREES 1. In a small bowl or 2 cup measuring
cup, beat the egg until foamy. 2. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and
blend well. 3. Add the baking soda, one teaspoonful at a time,
sprinkling it in and beating until the mixture is smooth and the
consistency of light cream. 4. Add the lemon juice all at once and
blend into the mixture. Stir, but do not beat (you want it creamy,
but without a lot of air) 5. The mixture will congeal into a pasty
lump.  Scoop it out of the bowl with a spatula and spread it on a
floured surface. 6. Sift the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar together
and use the fingertips to work it into the egg- lemon mixture. 7.
With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out 1/32' thick and with
the tip of a sharp knife, cut out 'angel' shapes and twist the edges
up to form a shell-like curve about 3/8" high. Sprinkle on the
remainder of the sugar. 8. Brush each 'angel' with melted butter. 9.
Place the angels one inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet and bake
for 12 minutes or until golden brown. NOTE: Remember making
'volcanos' in elementary school? This is the same classic chemical
reaction disguised as a cookie recipe. Anyone trying this will wind
up with a kitchen counter full of egg-lemon foam about 10 seconds
after completing step 4. From Penn and Teller's How to Play With Your
Food.
