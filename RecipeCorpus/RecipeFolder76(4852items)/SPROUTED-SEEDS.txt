Title: SPROUTED SEEDS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Seeds to be sprouted
1    Quart jar with holes in lid
1 c  Tepid water
Pour the water on the seeds and allow to soak for 2 to 4 hours. Pour
the water off and let the jar sit in a slightly warm place. The top
of the fridge works fine. Twice a day, add some tepid water to cover
the seed, and allow to soak for a few minutes.  Again, pour off the
excess water. Bright light will develop the green of the chlorophyll,
if you wish. Harvest when you feel like using them. Years ago, I
bought a three pack of plastic lids that had three different mesh
sizes. If I were to look for them again, I'd try a natural food
store, which is also a good place to find material for sprouting.

Things to Sprout: Alfalfa, fenugreek, mung bean, radish, lots more.
This is a good way to improve your winter salads with fresh produce.
