Harvest Jerusalem artichokes in the very early spring, before they
start sprouting, or in the very late fall.

Scrub the Jerusalem artichokes well, and cut into 1/4" slices. Place
in a large ceramic, glass or stainless steel bowl or crock and cover
with 8 c. vinegar (use more if necessary). Stir in the salt. Let
stand overnight.

In the morning, combine the 11 c. vinegar and 11 c. water in a
saucepan. Combine the dill, caraway and mustard seeds in a spice bag
and add to the brine. Bring to a boil; simmer for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, drain the artichokes.

Into each clean, hot quart jar, place 1 garlic clove and 1 pepper
pod. Pack with Jerusalem artichokes. Cover with hot brine, leaving
1/4" head space. Seal.

Process 10 minutes in a boiling hot water bath or steam canner.
