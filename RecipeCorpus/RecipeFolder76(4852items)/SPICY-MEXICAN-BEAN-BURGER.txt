Title: SPICY MEXICAN BEAN BURGER
Categories: Vegetables, August, Burgers
Yield: 8 Servings
16 oz Canned red kidney beans;
Drained & rinsed
1/2 sm Onion; coarsely chopped
1/2    Green pepper; coarsely ch.
1    Carrot, steamed; mashed
1/8 c  Picante sauce or salsa
1 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Black pepper or to taste
Dash of chili powder
Mix all ingredients together. Add more flour to create a firmer
mixture, or more salsa if mixture is too stiff. Form into balls and
smash into patties. Bake at 450 degrees for 15-20 minutes, until
firm, brown and done. Serve on whole wheat bun with lettuce, tomato
and salsa. Accompany with tortilla chi and a large glass of iced tea.
These can be grilled or pressed in those new=fangled sandwich
presses... a lot quicker and tastier than baking. The judges
suggested adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the recipe.
