Title: TAHINI
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 12 Servings
4 c  Sesame seeds
1/4 c  To 1/2 c vegetable oil
Preheat oven to 350F.  Spread sesame seeds on a shallow baking tray
and bake, shaking frequently, until fragrant, 3 to 10 minutes. Do not
brown. Cool.

Put sesame seeds in a blender or food processor fitted with the metal
blade.  Add vegetable oil.  Process to a smooth paste, about 5
minutes. Add more oil if necessary, to bring the paste to a thick
pouring consistency. Tahini will keep stored in a tightly covered jar
in the refrigerator for several months. Makes 3 cups.
