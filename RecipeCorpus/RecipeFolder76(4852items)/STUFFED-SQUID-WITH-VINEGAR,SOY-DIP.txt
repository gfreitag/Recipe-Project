Clean the squid under running water.  Remove clear inner quill, pull
away the head and tentacles, then cut off the tentacles just above
the head. Pull off the skin, discarding the little flaps. Wash squid
thoroughly. Very finely chop the tentacles and saute in the vegetable
oil with the meat, cabbage, bean sprouts, green onion and garlic.

Drain the mushrooms, squeeze out as much water as possible, remove the
stems and chop the caps finely. Add to the pan and stir fry for 1
minute, then add the soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper.

Fill the squid with the prepared stuffing, securing the opening with
wooden picks.  Set in a lightly oiled dish, sprinkle on a little
extra sesame oil and steam over rapidly boiling water for about 20
minutes. Remove from the steamer, cut the squid into thick slices and
serve with Vinegar/Soy Dip.

Alternatively, the squid can be steamed for 10 minutes, then
deep-fried until crisp and golden on the surface in a mixture of 4
parts vegetable oil to 1 part sesame oil.

Vinegar/Soy Dip:  Mix all ingredients.  The sauce keeps for several
days in the refrigerator without the green onions, one day with the
green onions.
