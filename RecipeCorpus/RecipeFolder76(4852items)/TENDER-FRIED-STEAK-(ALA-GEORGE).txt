1 1/2 lb Fresh Cube Steak
1    Env Liptons Onion Soup Mix

1) Cut cube steak into 4-6 oz pieces. 2) In shallow bowl, dissolve
envelope of Onion Soup mix in 1/2 cup of hot tap water. 3) Marinate
the steak pieces in the soup mixture and let stand until all the soup

medium-low heat with just enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom.
5) Roll marinated steak in flour. 6) Place steaks in pre-heated
skillet and fry, turning often, until juices run clear and coating is
golden brown. (As you turn sprinkle lightly with pepper and salt, one
time on each side) 7) Remove steaks and let drain 3-5 minutes on
paper towels.

IF GRAVY is desired, add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water to hot skillet,
scraping the bottom to loosed any crispies left from the steak
coating. Add 1 -2 teaspoons of flour (dissolved in a small amount of
cold water), with salt and pepper as necessary to make a smooth gravy.

YUM - YUM - YUM, Man that was good!

I served it with baked potatoes, real bacon bits and black-eyed peas.
