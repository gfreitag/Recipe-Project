Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lay uncooked bacon on a baking sheet
and bake until crisp. Get the salad ready for the adults.

Meanwhile for the kids, remove the crusts from half of the bread and
spread the bread with some peanut butter and top with either raisins,
cranberries or slices of banana. You'll have 2 closed sandwiches
which you should then cut into squares or triangles to create smaller
bite sized pieces.

For the adults, layer their bread with mozzarella and top with
anchovies or capers and basil.

Heat two skillets until warm, one with butter for the kids portion,
the other with olive oil for the adults. Gently cook some garlic in
the adult's portion as the oil is heating up.

Dip the adults and kids sandwiches in the egg and let it soak up.
Saute the kids portion in butter and the adults in olive oil; saute
until crisp and warm; drain briefly on paper towels.

Serve kids stuffed sandwiches with bacon and adults with salad.

Yield: 2 kids servings and 2 adult servings
