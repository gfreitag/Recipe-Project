Trim all visible fat from the chops, and slice the meat into thin
strips, about 1/4-inch thick, and 1/2 to 1-inch wide. Heat the oil in
a wok or large skillet over medium heat, then add the pork and brown,
stirring often.  Mix together the black pepper, soy sauce, garlic,
ginger, sesame seeds, and water, and add to the browned meat. Add the
onions. Cover, reduce heat, and let simmer for about 30 minutes,
until the pork is cooked through, stirring occasionally. Add more
water if necessary to prevent sticking. Meanwhile, cook the pea pods
according to package directions, without added salt. Add the cooked
pea pods to the pork, stir, and serve. Makes 4 servings.
