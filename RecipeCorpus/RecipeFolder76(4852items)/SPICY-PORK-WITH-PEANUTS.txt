Categories: Oriental, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Raw unsalted peanuts
3 tb Peanut oil
4    Whole dried chile peppers
4    Scallions; thinly sliced
3    Garlic cloves; thinly sliced
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 tb Chile paste with garlic
2 tb Dark soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1 1/2 tb Chinese rice wine
-=OR=- Dry sherry
1 tb Chinkiany vinegar; -=OR=-
2 ts -Red wine vinegar
-(or Cider vinegar)
1 ts Sesame oil
1 ts Cornstarch; mixed with
1 tb Chicken broth; (cold)
8 oz Boneless pork, cubed
STIR-FRY THE PEANUTS over a high flame in 1 tablespoon of the oil
until they develop a golden-brown color. This brings out their
flavor. Take care not to let them burn. Remove them and set them
aside. Lower the flame to medium. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of
oil and flavor it with the peppers. With the oil still at medium
heat, add the scallions and garlic. Stir-fry them for 10 to 20
seconds, until their aroma rises from the wok. Add the sauce
ingredients. When the sauce comes to a boil, add the cornstarch
dissolved in broth. The sauce must be thick enough to coat the pork
pieces. Since the pork is not seasoned, the sauce is the seasoning.
Add the pork pieces and the peanuts. Quickly toss to coat them well.
Stir and toss the pork for 30-to-45 seconds, or until the pieces are
cooked through. Turn the pork out on a serving plate.
