6 oz Swiss cheese
1    Onion, peeled and quartered

Saute garlic in bacon fat. Lower heat and and stir in chili powder

1/2 cup broth or water stirring constantly for 2-3 minutes. Slowly
add the rest of the broth stirring and cooking til thickened. Add
cooked and seasoned ground beef. To assemble the enchiladas: shred
both cheeses and combine. Finely chop onion and add to cheese
reserving 2-3 tbs for garnish. Heat about 1/2" oil in a skillet large
enough to hold a tortilla. Pass the tortillas through, one at a time
through the hot oil to soften and seal. Do not fry crisp. Blot
between paper towel to remove oil. Dip each tortilla in the heated
sauce and fill with the cheese and onion. Roll up and place seam side
down in a baking dish. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas. Cover
with foil and bake at 350 for 10 minutes. Remove enchiladas and
increase oven temp to 475. Remove foil and spoon about 1 1/2 cups
sauce over the enchiladas, top with the reserved cheese and return to
the oven uncovered for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
Serve the enchiladas topped with the reserved onion and pass
additional sauce separately. From: Sally Hilfiger
