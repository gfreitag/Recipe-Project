Categories: Cookies
Yield: 48 Cookies
3/4 c  Butter, softened
2/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
1    Egg

baking powder; mix well. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. On
lightly floured surface shape each part into 12 x 3/4 inch roll;
place on ungreased cookie sheets. Using handle of wooden spoon or
finger, make depression about 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch deep
lengthwise down center of each roll. Fill each roll with 2
tablespoons of jelly.

Bake at 350F for 15 to 20 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool
slightly; cut diagonally into strips. Cool completely on wire racks.

Notes:  I always seem to get more than 48 - guess I'm cutting them too
small.  If using jam, try to use seedless, or strain it first.
