Title: SPLIT PEA SOUP #2
Categories: Vegetarian, Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
8 c  Water
2 1/4 c  Split peas, dried
1 md Onion
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2    Carrots, chopped
2    Celery, chopped
1 lb. of dried split peas = approx. 2 1/4 cups

Heat water and peas to boiling.  Boil for 2 minutes, then remove from
heat and cover.  Let sit for 1 hour.

Add ham (whole), onion, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer until peas
are tender, about 1 hour.

Remove ham and trim meat from bone.  (I usually use 1 lb boneless
smoked ham) Cut ham to 1/2 inch pieces. Stir ham, carrots, and celery
into soup. Cover and simmer until veggies are tender, about 45
minutes.

Like I said, it freezes well and is a very convenient side to a
sandwich or whatever.
