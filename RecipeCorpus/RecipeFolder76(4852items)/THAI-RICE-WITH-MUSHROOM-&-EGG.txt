Title: THAI RICE WITH MUSHROOM & EGG
Categories: Thai, Rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
3/8 lb Thai jasmine rice
1/2 tb Sunflower oil
1    Beaten eggs
1/8 oz Porcini or cap mushrooms
2    Spring onions
1/2    Garlic clove
4 oz Flat mushrooms
1 1/2 tb Dry sherry
1 1/2 tb Japanese soy sauce
1/2 tb Sugar
3 3/4    Cm piece of cucumber
Preparation: beat the eggs. Slice the spring onions. Soak the porcini
or cap mushrooms in warm water for 30 mins. Crush the garlic cloves.
Slice the flat mushrooms. Cut the cucumber into matchsticks.

Notes: There is a lot of sauce with this recipe - don't worry! If you
can't find dried porcini or cap mushrooms then use 1/2 pound of
shittake mushrooms (to serve 4) for all the mushrooms in the dish.

1, Rinse the rice under running water and drain.
Place in a heavy-based pan witl 600ml (to serve 4) of water and
bring to the boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the
surface
water has been absorbed and there are craters over the top of the
rice. Turn off the heat, cover the pan tightly and leave to stand.

2. Heat a teaspoon of the oil in a wok or frying pan and add the
beaten
eggs. Cook on one side to make a thin omelette. Slide on to a
plate,
roll up, cut into strips and set aside.

3. Drain the dried mushrooms, reserving the liquid, and chop roughly.
Heat the remaining oil in the wok, add the spring onions, garlic
and mushrooms. Stir fry for 3 minutes, then add the sherry, soy
sauce, sugar and six tablespoons of the mushroom liquor. Bring to
the boil and simmer for two minutes.

4. Transfer rice to a shallow serving dish, spoon over the mushrooms
and their sauce and garnish with omelette, cucumber matchsticks
and spring onion curls.

NB: the eggs can be omitted from this dish, with no problem.
