1. Add beans to boiling water. Boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat,
cover, and soak 1 hour or overnight in refrigerator.

2. Add salt. Bring beans to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and boil
gently until tender -- 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

3. Drain. Save 1 cup bean cooking liquid. Mix with beans and remaining
ingredients in saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, cover, and boil gently 30 minutes.

4. Continue cooking, uncovered, until sauce is of desired
consistency--about 10 minutes.

5. Serve half of the beans and refrigerate remaining 2 cups for use at
another meal within 3 to 4 days. *

*NOTE: 3-1/4 cups canned navy beans, drained, may be used in place of
dried beans; omit 4 cups boiling water and salt and steps 1 and 2.
Use 1 cup water in place of bean cooking liquid. Combine beans and 1
cup water with other ingredients and proceed as directed in step 3
above. About 260 calories per serving.

*NOTE: Reheat beans over medium heat until mixture is bubbly,
stirring as needed to prevent sticking.
