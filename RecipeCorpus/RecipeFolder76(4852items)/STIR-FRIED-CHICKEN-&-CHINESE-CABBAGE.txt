2 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Cornstarch
1 ts Sugar
2 ts Rice or cider vinegar

* NOTE: boneless pork cutlet can be substituted for chicken

Partially freeze meat (about 30 minutes) to make slicing easier,
especially if your knife is not very sharp. Slice the meat across the
grain into thin strips and place on a plate near the cooking area.
Prepare the Chinese cabbage, onion, ginger and garlic as indicated
and arrange on plate with chicken.

In a measuring cup or small bowl, combine the water, soy sauce,
cornstarch, sugar and vinegar; stir to dissolve the cornstarch and
sugar. Place by meat and vegetables.

Preheat a heavy 10-inch saute pan, non-reactive skillet, or wok on
high heat for about 1 minute.  Add oil and tilt pan to coat evenly;
add chicken. Cook, turning constantly, for 1 minute. Add cabbage,
green onion, ginger and garlic; continue cooking and stirring another
minute. Stir in the liquid mixture; cook and stir until the sauce is
thickened and the vegetables are tender-crisp and brightly colored,
about 30 seconds more.

Serve over hot cooked rice.
