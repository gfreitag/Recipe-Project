Title: THE PUNCHBOWL
Categories: Beverages, Holiday, Mc
Yield: 16 Servings
6 oz Pineapple juice, frozen
-concentrate, thawed
6 oz Orange juice, frozen
-concentrate, thawed
6 oz Cranberry juice
2 c  Strawberries, frozen
1    Banana
6 oz Lemonade, frozen concentrate
2 1/2 c  Cold water
30 oz Club soda, 1 bottle
30 oz Ginger ale, 1 bottle
2    Bottles 7-UpÂ®
* All frozen concentrates are to be thawed partially. ** Use as much
7-UP or equal amounts of other soft drinks to make the punch to your
taste.

1. Using a blender, blend the juices a little at a time, pouring into
large punchbowl or other large container. Blend the banana and
strawberries only until coarse blended, not pureed. Mix the ice water
in the punch bowl with other ingredients and stir to blend. 2. Just
before serving, add the club soda, ginger ale and enough 7-Up to suit
your taste. Stir gently to mix all juices from the sediment on bottom
of bowl. Serve this as is or over ice.

Serving Ideas : Serve this at any occasion for a non-alcoholic punch.

NOTES : You may wish to make an ice ring to float in this for a
decorative and festive touch. Using a ring mold, freeze a shallow
layer of water, put fruits in a pattern on top of ice, pour a thin
layer of water, refreeze. Repeat these steps until you have built up
the ice ring and made several layers of fruit designs. Unmold the
ring and place in punch bowl just before serving. Use juice instead
of water for ice ring if you wish.
