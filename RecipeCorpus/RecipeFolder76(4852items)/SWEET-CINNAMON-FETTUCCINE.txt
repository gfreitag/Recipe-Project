Place flour in mound on surface or in large bowl. Make a well in
center of flour. Add remaining ingredients except oil. Mix thoroughly
with fork, gradually bringing flour to center, until dough forms. (If
dough is too sticky, gradually add flour when kneading. If dough is
too dry, mix in water.) Knead on lightly floured surface about 10
minutes or until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap or foil. Let stand
15 minutes. Divide dough into 4 equal parts. Roll and cut each part
into fettuccine as directed in Egg Noodles (See RECIPE). Heat oil (2
inches) in deep fryer or 4-quart Dutch oven to 375F. Fry a few
noodles at a time about 30 seconds or until golden brown. Drain on
paper towels. Keep noodles warm in 200F oven. Serve warm.
