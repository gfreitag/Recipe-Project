Title: SPINACH GLOP
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Spinach, rinsed, trimmed and
Lightly steamed
x  Few tablespoons balsamic
Vinegar
2    Cloves garlic (or more)
x  Miscellaneous additions: a
Fresh tomato, fresh basil
Leaves, parsley,
Onion, etc.
Whiz all the ingredients together in a blender or food processer
until you have a thick but pourable puree. Serve over hot cooked
brown basmati rice. Makes enough for two hungry people. (My SO topped
his off with olive oil and parmesan to start out with, but gradually
stopped).
