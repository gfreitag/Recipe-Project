Title: SWEET YEAST CRUST
Categories: Cheese, Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Active Dry Yeast; 1 Pk.
1/4 c  Water; Warm, 110-115 deg. F.
2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted
1/4 c  Sugar; Granulated
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter
1    Egg; Large, Lightly Beaten
Lightly grease the baking pan.  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.
In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, sugar and salt until well
blended. In a saucepan, heat the milk and butter, then cool to
lukewarm. Add the warm milk and the yeast mixture to the dry
ingredients, then add the egg. Blend well to form a moist soft dough.
Knead lightly until the dough is soft and smooth.  Return the dough
to a clean greased bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Set the dough
in a warm place to rise. Let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in
size.  When the dough is ready, punch it down and pat it into a thin
layer.  Place the layer into the bottom of the pan folding the excess
dough up the sides of the pan making it as smooth as possible. Allow
the dough to rise again, in the pan until it is doubled, bout 30 to
45 minutes. When the dough is double the crust is ready to be filled.
