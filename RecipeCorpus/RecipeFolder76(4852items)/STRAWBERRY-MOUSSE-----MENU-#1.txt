In food processor combine strawberry slices, 1/2 cup of the sugar,

In small pot over very low heat, combine orange juice with gelatin.
Heat, stirring frequently, until all gelatin dissolves, about 2
minutes. Slowly whisk gelatin mixture into strawberry puree.

With mixer at high speed, beat cream until soft peaks form. Fold 1/4
of whipped cream into strawberry mixture until well conbined., Gently
fold in remaining whipped cream. Line 5 cup bowl or mold with plastic
wrap. Pour in mousse. Chill until firm, about 2 hours.

To unmold, invert onto serving platter. Gently pull mold away from
plastic wrap. Peel off wrap. Smooth sides of mousse, if necessary,
with small warm knife or metal spatula. Garnish mousse with whipped
cream, strawberries and mint, if desired.

Ready to serve in 2 hours 20 minutes.

Tips: To make the cream extra fluffy, chill the cream, mixing bowl and
beaters for at least 3 hours before beating.

Make sure that the orange juice mixture and strawberry puree is at
about the same temperature, so it will combine more easily; (no
lumps). SLOWLY whisk juice mixture into puree.
