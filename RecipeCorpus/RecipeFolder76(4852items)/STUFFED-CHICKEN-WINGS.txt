Title: STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS
Categories: Poultry, Vietnamese
Yield: 8 Wings
8    Chicken wings
4 oz Bean thread vermicelli
3    Pieces dark wood ear fungus
1 1/4 c  Ground pork
1    Small onion
1    Small carrot
1    Egg, beaten
1 tb Nuoc Mam sauce or light soy
Salt and black pepper
Bone the chicken wings by cutting around the bone with a sharp knife.
Holding the wingtip, gently ease the bone away to leave the skin and
a thin layer of chicken.

Soak the vermicelli in warm water for 10 minutes then drain
thoroughly and cut into short strands.  Soak the wood ear fungus in
warm water for 10 minutes then squeeze dry and chop into thin slices.

Mix all the stuffing ingredients together.  The mixture should be
firm. Mold the stuffing into a ball and insert it into the bag of
flesh and skin of the chicken wing.

Preheat the oven to 400F.  Steam the stuffed wings for 10-15 minutes.
(If you want to make a large quantity, multiply the measures
accordingly and freeze after the steaming stage.

After steaming, place in a lightly oiled roasting pan and roast in
the oven for 30 minutes.  Serve on a bed of lettuce as a starter or
with rice and a beef stir-fried dish.
