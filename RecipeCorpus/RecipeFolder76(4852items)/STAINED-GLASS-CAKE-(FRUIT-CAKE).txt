Title: STAINED-GLASS CAKE (FRUIT CAKE)
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Plain flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 lb Glace pineapple
2 oz Glace pear
2 oz Glace kiwi fruit
2 oz Glace apple
2 oz Glace apricot
4 oz Glace cherries
4 oz Sultanas
4 oz Currants
2    Eggs
1/3 c  Brown sugar
4 oz Halved blanched almonds
4 oz Halved pecan nuts
4 oz Halved macadamia ants
4 oz Halved Brazil nuts
1/4 c  Grand Marnier or Cointreau.
From the traditional to the (comparatively) new-fangled. Stained
glass or bishopcakes, very popular in the UK, are so called, one
presumes, because they consist almost entirely of glace fruit and
nuts, and the glace fruit has something of the translucency of a
stained-glass church window.

Butter  a large cake tin. Line with waxed paper. Butter the paper.
Chop the glace fruits roughly.  Sift together the flour and baking
powder.

Mix in all the fruits,  together with the nuts. Put the mixture into
the cake tin, wet hands  and press mixture down firmly.

Bake in a preheated 300F  degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. Take cake out
of the oven and drizzle the Grand Marnier or Cointreau over the top.
Leave the cake in the oven to cool until warm, then wrap it, tin and
all, in aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight.

Remove from tin, peel away paper and store in airtight tin.
