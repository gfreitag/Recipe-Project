This is their #1 Base and works best with the Donvier.

Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2
minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a little at at time, then continue
wisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more. Pour in the
cream and milk and whisk to blend.

Makes 1 quart

You add candies, flavorings, fruit etc. to this base. My husband loves
vanilla so I add 1 tablespoon vanilla to above recipe.

Heath Bar Crunch

4 original Heath Bars.  1 1/8 oz each 2 large eggs 3/4 cup sugar 2
cups heavy cream 1 cup milk 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Cut the candy bars into 1/2 to 1 inch chunks, you should have about 1
cup. Place the chunks in a bowl, cover and freeze.

Mix the remaining ingredients using the directions up above.

Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze following the
manufacturer's instructions.

After the ice cream stiffens and about 2 minutes before it is done
add the candy then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready.
Makes a generous 1 quart.
