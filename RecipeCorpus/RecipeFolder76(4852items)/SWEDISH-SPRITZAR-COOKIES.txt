Title: SWEDISH SPRITZAR COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 72 Cookies
1 1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Almond extract
4 c  Flour, sifted
1 ts Baking powder
Thoroughly cream butter or margarine and sugar. Add egg, vanilla, and
almond extract; beat well.

Sift together flour and baking powder; add gradually to creamed
mixture, mixing to a smooth dough. Force dough through cooky press
onto ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with colored sugar, if desired.

Bake in hot oven, 400 degrees 8 to 10 minutes. Cool.

Variations: substitute other extracts for the almond extract, and
experiment with coloring the dough with food coloring and trying
different toppings.  In addition to the recipes following, I've also
tried raspberry extract and red food coloring, and maple extract
topped with walnut pieces and cinnamon sugar (put the walnuts on
first, then the sugar!). I've used candy coated multi-colored mini
chocolate chips for a topping, as well as the usual jimmies and other
sprinkles.
