Title: STUFFED CHERRY TOMATOES
Categories: Tomatoes, Summer, Southwester
32    cherry tomatoes
Yield: 8 Servings
1    filling recipe

Stuffed cherry tomatoes are a bit more work than large ones, but they
have the same virtues;  they add color to an hors d'oeuvres platter,
are easy to handle, and are perfect portion controls. Prepare then in
the same way as the shells for Cold Stuffed Tomatoes, although you
will have to be even more careful not to tear the sides. Discard the
caps in this case. Salt and drain the tomatoes for 30 minutes, and
stuff with the filling of your= choice. Each tomato will hold about 1
tablespoon of filling. Try Salmon Mousse, Tapenade Dip, Pesto
Mayonnaise, or Taramosalata; or mash a bit of soft fresh chevre
cheese such as Montrachet. Garnish each tomato with a sprig of fresh
dill or parsley or a basil leaf. Chill until serving time.
