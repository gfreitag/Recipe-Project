Title: STEAK AU POIVRE #2
Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 ts Green peppercorns
1 ts Black peppercorns
1 ts White peppercorns
1    Boneless strip beef steaks
-(6 oz)
3 tb Unsalted butter
3 dr Hot-pepper sauce
3 dr Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Brandy
3 tb Whipping cream
Salt to taste
Coarsely crush all peppercorns in a pestle and mortar.

Sprinkle crushed pepper over both sides of steaks, pressing in well
with palm of hand. Let stand 30 minutes. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter
in a skillet and heat until foaming. Add steaks and cook 2-3 minutes,
then turn and cook other sides 2-3 minutes. (This timing gives
medium-rare steaks, so adjust cooking time to suit personal
preferences.)

Turn steaks again and top each one with remaining butter and sprinkle
with a few drops hot-pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Pour
brandy over steaks and allow to heat through a few seconds. Flame and
remove from heat. When flames subside, remove steaks to a warm
serving plate and keep warm. Add whipping cream to skillet and stir
well. Heat through 1 minute, scraping up sediment from bottom of
skillet. Season with salt and spoon mixture over steaks. Serve at
once.

NOTE: Serve with fried potatoes and a green salad. Garnish with a
fresh Italian parsley sprig, if desired.
