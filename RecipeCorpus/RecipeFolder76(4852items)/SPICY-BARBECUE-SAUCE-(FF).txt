Categories: None

3/4 c  Catsup
2 tb (veggie) Worcestershire

1/2 c  Water
6 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Brown sugar
1 sm Bay leaf
1 ts Dried oregano

Combine liquid ingredients in small saucepan. Combine dry ingredients
in bowl. Add dry ingredients to liquids and mix well. Bring mixture
to a boil, then simmer 1 hour over low heat. Covered or not; it
splatters if you don't cover it but if you don't mind cleaning up
your stove the sauce thickens up more if it's uncovered. (take out
the bay leaf!)
