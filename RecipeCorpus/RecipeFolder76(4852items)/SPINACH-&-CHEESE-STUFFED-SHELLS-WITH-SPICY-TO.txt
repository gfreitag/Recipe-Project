aside.Meanwhile, cook the pasta shells according to package

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To prepare the filling, combine
1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese in a medium-size bowl with the ricotta
cheese, spinach, nutmeg, egg white, the remaining garlic and pepper,
and the reserved onion mixture. Mix well.

Spoon half the tomato sauce into an ungreased 9x9x2-inch baking dish.
Spoon 3 tablespoons of the cheese filling into each shell, and place
in the pan. Repeat until all the shells are used. Top with the
remaining sauce. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.
Uncover, sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese on top, and bake,
uncovered, 5 minutes longer.
