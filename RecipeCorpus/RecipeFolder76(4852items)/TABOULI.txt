Title: TABOULI
Categories: Appetizers, Rice, Mcdougall
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Bulgur; dry
1 c  Water; boiling
1    Tomato; chopped
1/2 c  Fresh parsley; chopped
2 tb Lemon juice
1/8 ts Garlic powder
1/4 c  Green onions; chopped
(about 3 green onions)
1/4 c  Fresh mint leaves
1/2 c  Garbanzo beans, cooked
Recipe by: McDougall Put the bulgur in a small mixing bowl. Pour the
boiling water over the bulgur. Mix. Cover with a towel and let stand
for 1 hour. After 1 hour the excess water should be removed. The
easiest way to do this is to pour the bulgur and water into a fine
mesh strainer. Let the water drain off, pressing the bulgur with your
hands to remove as much of the excess water as possible. Place the
drained bulgur in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients. Toss well to
mix. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours to blend flavors.

HELPFUL HINTS: This is a great make-ahead dish, easy to take to a
pot-luck dinner or picnic. Try it stuffed in pita bread for a
different sandwich idea. This recipe can be doubled or quadrupled
easily for larger amounts. Keeps well in regrigerator. From the
