Mark Haugen writes: "This makes a great summer buffet dish. Just add
some terrific corn sticks and you have a simply delicious meal."

STEP ONE: Roast all peppers and chiles over an open flame until the
skin blisters. Then place them in a covered bowl or plastic bag until
the skin begins to loosen. Peel, seed, and cut into 1/2-inch dice.

Combine diced peppers, turkey, and celery in a large bowl. Season
with salt and pepper to taste.

STEP TWO: To make dressing, please refer to the recipe "Almond-Anaheim
Dressing" in this cookbook.

STEP THREE: Toss salad with dressing and adjust seasonings to your
preference. Serve salad sprinkled with toasted almonds and garnished
with fresh fruits.
