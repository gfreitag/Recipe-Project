Categories: Pulses, Grains
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Chuck Roast
2 tb Wine Vinegar
3    Cubes Beef Bouillon
1 ts Chili Powder
2 lg Onions, Chopped
1 lg Green Bell Pepper
28 oz Canned, Whole Tomatoes
16 oz Kidney Beans
Salt
Pepper
1 c  Cheddar, Shredded
2 c  Tortilla Chips
Trim all excess fat from the beef. Cut the meat from the bone in
chunks. Put the meat and the bone in a large, heavy metal pan with
water to barely cover. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until the
meat releases juices and turns gray (about 30 minutes). Uncover and
cook the juices away. Turn the meat in the rendered fat which remains
until well browned on all sides (about 30 minutes more). Lift out the
meat and set aside. Add 1/4 cup of water and the vinegar to the pan.
Scrape the pan to loosen the browned bits. Remove the seeds and
membranes from the green bell pepper and chop. Add the bouillon
cubes, chili powder, onions and green bell pepper. Cook, stirring,
for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their liquid. Break up the
tomatoes using the back of a spoon. Add the kidney beans. Return the
meat to the pan. Stir to mix. Cover and simmer until the meat is
tender enough to fall apart easily (about 2 hours). Discard the
bones. Skim off the fat and add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle
shredded cheese and chopped green onion over the top. Serve with
tortilla chips on the side
