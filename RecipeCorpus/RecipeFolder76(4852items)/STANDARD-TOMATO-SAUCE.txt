Title: STANDARD TOMATO SAUCE
Categories: Canning, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: For thin sauce -- An average of 35 pounds is needed per
canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 21 pounds is needed per canner
load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 10 to 12 quarts
of sauce-an average of 5 pounds per quart.

For thick sauce -- An average of 46 pounds is needed per canner load
of 7 quarts; an average of 28 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
pints. A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 7 to 9 quarts of sauce-an
average of 6-1/2 pounds per quart.

Procedure: Prepare and press as for making tomato juice. Simmer in
large-diameter saucepan until sauce reaches desired consistency Boil
until volume is reduced by about one-third for thin sauce, or by
one-half for thick sauce. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid to
jars (See acidification directions). Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart
to the jars, if desired. Fill jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace.
Adjust lids and process. Recommended process times are given in Table
1, Table 2, and Table 3.

weighted-gauge pressure canner.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Pints. Process Time: 20 min. Canner
Gauge Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
5    lb.
Above 1,000 ft:

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Quarts. Process Time: 15 min. Canner
Gauge Prssure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
10    lb.
Above 1,000 ft:
15    lb. . NOTE: This section of the guide appears to contain
some sort of error in the information given within Table 3 above. In
the USDA book, there are only TWO sizes of jars specified in the
table, but there are THREE separate lines of figures in the table,
and it is not completely clear which jar size the second and third
entries refer to. I have given the second entry's numbers as those to
be used for Quart jars, and below I have reprinted the third entry on
the table, for an unknown jar size.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: ??. Process Time: 10 min. Canner Gauge
Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
15    lb.
Above 1,000 ft: Not Recommended.
