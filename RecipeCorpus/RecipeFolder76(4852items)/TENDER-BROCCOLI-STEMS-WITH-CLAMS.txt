Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Broccoli
4 lg Cloves garlic
1 tb Fermented soy beans
1/4 c  Canned baby clams (or
-crabmeat or shrimp)
1/2 c  Stock
2 tb Peanut oil for first
-stir-frying
1 tb Peanut oil
Cornstarch paste
Preparation:  Wash broccoli and cut off flowerets (save for another
dish). With small paring knife, carefully peel outer skin off
broccoli stems, beginning at the base.  Leave inner stems whole.  Cut
stems on the bias into 1/4" slices.

Rinse fermented soy beans.  Peel garlic.  Mince together soy beans and
garlic; then mash to a paste using mortar and pestle; set aside. Place
drained baby clams in stock. If substituting fresh clams, crabmeat or
shrimp, wash, shell and chop into small pieces.

Stir-frying:  Heat wok to hot, then add first of oil. When oil just
begin to smoke, add broccoli and toss quickly to avoid burning.
Stir-fry for about 1 minute. Turn heat down to moderate (or on
electric range, remove from heat).  Push broccoli up side of wok; add
remaining oil to bottom of wok; add soy bean mixture. Press and stir
until odor of beans and garlic is present.

Return to high heat and immediately recombine with broccoli, stirring
constantly for about 30 seconds. Beans and garlic will burn easily,
so keep mixture moving. Quickly add clams and stock; stir-fry for
another 30 seconds.  Cover for 30 seconds to finish cooking broccoli.
Remove cover; thicken with cornstarch paste to light sauce.
