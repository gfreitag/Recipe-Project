Shredded Chinese cabbage is best stir-fried in the wok. It is
delightful spiced with chilli and ginger, and goes well with pasta
dishes.

Mix the shredded cabbage with the chilli and ginger. Stir-fry in the
groundnut oil for 3 minutes, then add the dark sesame oil, sugar and
vinegar. Heat through, stirring, and cook for 2 minutes. Season to
taste with salt and serve as soon as possible.
