necessary to keep the mixture smooth.Beat in the vanilla and sweet
potatoes...
Add the sifted dry ingredients in three additions,alternating with
the milk in two additions.Beat just enough to make the batter
smooth.Stir in the prunes and walnuts...
Turn the batter into a 10" greased and floured tube pan,mounding the
batter slightly higher at the edges of the pan.This is to keep the
cake from rising to high in the center.......
Bake in a preheated 300 deg.oven for 1 1/2 hours,or until a tester
comes out with just a crumb clinging to it.Cool in the pan on a rack
for 15 minutes.Remove from pan and cool until room temperature before
slicing.Slice with a serrated knife..Makes 14 to 16 servings....
