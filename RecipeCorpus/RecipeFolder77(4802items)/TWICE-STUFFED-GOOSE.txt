Title: TWICE STUFFED GOOSE
Categories: Poultry, Stuffing
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Goose (or duck)
3    Onions -- chopped
2 pk Brown/wild rice
1 c  Mushrooms -- chopped
1/2 c  Green olives -- halved or
Chopped
1 cn Condensed Cream of Mushroom
Soup
1.  In a big sauce pan, prepare the rice (I use Uncle Ben's) just as
the package dictates.

2.  In a separate skillet, saute the mushrooms, onions, and olives
with butter. Mix the rice and the sauted stuff together.

3.  Stuff this mixture into the bird's cavity, packing in as much as
you= can.

4.  Place the bird in a pan or casserole that has tall sides, with
just enough room for him to fit in. Pack the rest of your rice
mixture around the bird, and on top. Bake at 190 =F8C for 1 hour,
then turn it down to 160 =F8C= for 4 hours (depending on your
elevation).

5.  Remove the bird from the oven, and place him on a separate
platter. Scoop out all the stuffing and mix it all together with the
stuffing that was on and around the bird. Re-stuff the bird. With the
stuffing that is left, mix it with the soup, UNDILUTED, straight from
the can, and re-pack that around the bird as before. Return to the
oven .TE (325) (160) for another hour.

Author's Notes: I have, on occasion, managed to bring a bird or two
home. A favorite recipe of mine originally called for a goose, but
I've made it with duck as well.

The bird and stuffing is very moist and quite delicious. I did not
mention adding salt, because you should taste test to find out what
is best for you. (I don't add any 'cause the flavor packet that comes
with the rice is salty enough) I serve the bird separately (deboned)
from the stuffing (with soup mix and without from inside the bird).

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: approximate measurements.
