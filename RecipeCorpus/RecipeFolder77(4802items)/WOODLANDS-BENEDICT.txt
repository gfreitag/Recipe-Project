salt and pepper. Remove from skillet and keep warm. Heat remaining
butter in same skillet. Saut spinach until limp, tossing gently. Heat
Bernaise sauce in small saucepan over low heat just until warm
(Over-heating will cause mixture to separate). Stir in tomato.

% Spoon some of the spinach and mushroom mixture on each muffin half.
Top each with a poached egg. Spoon Bernaise sauce over each muffin.
Serves 4-6.

NOTE: To poach eggs: In a deep 10- to 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat
2-3 inches of water to boiling. Reduce heat to keep water gently
simmering. Break cold eggs, one at a time into a custard cup or
saucer. Slip gently into water. Cook 3-5 minutes, depending on
desired doneness. Lift out eggs with slotted spoon. Eggs can be kept
warm in a shallow baking dish filled with warm water. From the files
