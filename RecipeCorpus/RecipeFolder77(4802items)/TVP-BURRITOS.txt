Title: TVP BURRITOS
Categories: Main dish, Digest
Yield: 2 -3
2 c  Medium size TVP chunks
-chopped onion
1 pk Of taco seasoning
1 cn Kidney beans OR 1 can
-fat-free chile
-soft burrito shells, if
-you can find them without
-oil, if not use
-soft flat bread (like pita
-bread but not pocketed)
Cover the TVP with boiling water and soak for 10 minutes. While it's
soaking, saute chopped onion. Put the TVP into the pan, add the taco
mix and enough water to dissolve the seasoning, but not enough to
make it watery. Stir for awhile to mix the seasoning in, then add the
beans/chile. Cook for no more than 15 minutes (or the TVP gets too
mushy).

We garnish with fat-free sour cream, fat-free shredded cheddar and
salsa. Enjoy!
