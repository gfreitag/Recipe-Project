Categories: Soups, Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
3 lg Yellow bell peppers
-- seeded & coarsely chopped
4    Shallots; finely chopped
1 1/2 c  Raw cashews
3 1/2 c  Vegetable stock or bouillon
1 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Fine sea salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper

In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bell
peppers and shallots, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
the peppers are very soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Put the cashews and 1-1/2 cups of the vegetable stock in a blender.
Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.  Add the cooked peppers, mustard,
salt, and pepper, and puree.

Pour the soup into a medium saucepan, and stir in the remaining 2 cups
vegetable stock.  Bring just to a simmer over medium heat. Serve hot,
garnished with parsley sprigs.
