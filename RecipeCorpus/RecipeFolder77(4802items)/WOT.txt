Categories: Chicken, Ethiopia
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Whole chicken, skinned and
-cut into serving peices (
-or 6 legs and 6
Thighs)
8 lb Of onions, chopped FINE
1 lb Of mashed garlic
1/4 lb Mashed ginger
MMMMM----------------2 LADLES FULL OF ETHIOPIAN C---------------------
Nothing
lse will serve, although chili powder is the closest) 1 to 1 anda
half lbs butter (M. says Ethipians like to see it swimming on top)
Salt and pepper to taste Nutmeg or cumin optional. 1 hard-boiled egg
per person Cook onion over low heat, not in any fat, for a long time,
stirring constantly over very low heat until all the water is
evaporated. Continue stirring until onions are slightly brown. THEN
add the butter; cook about 15-20 minutes still over low heat. Add 1
tbsp hot water from time to time (texture should be kind of pasty).
Add bere bere. If it looks too dry, add hot water and stir. Cook it
about 30-45 minutes - keep stirring frequently. Keep adding hot water
if necessary. Be careful not to let it brown, because chili powder
will become bitter. Add gar lic and ginger and simmer 15 moreminutes.
Add water as needed. Meanwhile, with your other set of free hands,
wash chicken peices well, and let stand in salted in lemoned water.
Then squeeze each peice really hard to get out as much water as
possible. Then, make little slits in the meat so the sauce will
penetrate. Cook the meat in the sauce until meat tis tender, about 30
minutes. Stir from time to time. All this has been uncovered, by the
way. Add spices to taste just before removing from stove. Add 1
hard-boiled egg per person, which have been slit (the eggs, not the
people), and cook just long enough to heat through. Serve with lots
of bread (injera). Freezes well. Sorry about the wierd format, I am
anything but a master of UNIX. (Argh) - ++ Wot (this is a chicken
version, it can be made with other meats)
