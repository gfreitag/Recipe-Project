DOUGH: Dissolve the yeast in water with the sugar & let proof. Mix in
the other ingredients in order. When the dough holds together (add
more water or flour as necessary) turn out onto a floured board &
knead until it is elastic & soft.  Cover & let rest for about 40
minutes. Roll out as thin as you can without breaking the dough.
Place either on a 17" pizza pan or on a cookie sheet.  Set aside.

PIZZA TOPPINGS: Saute the onion & garlic in the olive oil until the
onions are translucent.  Add the basil & bell peppers & saute for 5
minutes. Add the shredded tofu & cook 3 minutes or so. Add the
parsley, tomatoes & olives.  Remove from the heat.  Spread the
vegetables on the pizza crust & sprinkle with the nutritional yeast.
Bake for 5 to 10 minutes at 450F until the crust is golden & the
vegetables are sizzling.

NOTE: The baking time is dependent upon how thick your crust is.
Also, you can use your favourite pizza crust too.
