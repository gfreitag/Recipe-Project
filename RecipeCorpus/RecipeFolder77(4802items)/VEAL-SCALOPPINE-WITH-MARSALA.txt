Title: VEAL SCALOPPINE WITH MARSALA
Categories: Italian, Meats
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 lb Scallopine of veal, cut
Into 1/4 inch slices
Flour for dredging
Salt
Freshly ground Pepper
2 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Marsala wine
Unless the scaloppine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring
ab. 3 in. by 3 in or slightly larger. Place them between sheets of
wax paper and pound lightly to flatten.(use a rolling pin, bottom of
a heavy skillet, pounder, etc.) Blend flour with salt and pepper to
taste. Dip the meat into flour to coat lightly. Using a large, heavy
skillet, heat the butter and oil and when it is very hot but not
brown, add the meat in one layer. Cook over relatively high heat
until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook until golden brown on
the other. The cooking time should be from 4-6 min. Transfer meat to
a serving platter or two plates and keep warm. To the skillet add the
wine and stir to dissolve the particles in the pan. Reduce wine
slightly and pour equal amounts over each serving. Naturally, these
amts. may be increased to serve more people. For Chicken marsala, I
don't see why you can't substitute chicken breasts.
