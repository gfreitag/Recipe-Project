Title: TORTELLINI SALAD
Categories: Salads, Pasta, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Prosciutto, thinley sliced
1 lb Peas (fresh or Frozen)
1 lb Bunch fresh basil
1/4 c  White wine vinegar
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 tb Dijon mustard
3    Cloves garlic
1 c  Olive oil
1    Pepperoni (optional), sliced
2 lb Tortellini
Serves 4

Bring 5 quarts of water to a rolling boil.

Add tortellini and cook until plump and tender, about 8 to 10
minutes. Add 2 tablespoons salt to the water a few minutes before
pasta is cooked. Drain and refresh under cold water. Pour a few
tablespoons olive oil over pasta and toss gently to prevent from
sticking together.

Trim fat from proscuitto and cut into small squares. Steam peas until
just tender, then plunge into cold water to stop cooking and preserve
color. Pick over basil, removing all stems. Wash and let dry on a
paper towel.

DRESSING: In a stainless-steel bowl, combine white vinegar, lemon
juice, mustard, garlic, and whisk together. Continue whisking while
adding olive oil in a slow, steady stream until vinaigrette is well
blended and thick.

To assemble Combine tortellini, proscuitto, and peas in a large bowl.
Pour half the dressing over the mixture and toss gently to coat
evenly. Tear fresh basil leaves into quarters and add to salad.
Chill. Before serving, moisten with more vinaigerette, toss and
transfer onto a serving platter. Sprinkle with parsely.
