Title: WONDERFUL PASTRY 2
Categories: Pies
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Teasp.
For 8 or 9" Two-crust pie
You'll need
For 8 or 9" pie shell

Sifted all-purpose flour    2 1/4 cups
1    cup plus 2 Tablesp. Salt
1/2 teasp. Shortening (except
1    teasp.
butter, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablesp. 7 tablesp. margarine, or salad oil)
Cold water 5 to 5 1/2 tablesp. About 2 tablesp. plus

In bowl, mix flour and salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives,
scissor-fashion, cut two thirds of shortening into flour until like
corn meal-for tenderness. Cut in remaining shortening until like
large peas-for flakiness. (Or cut in all at once until like coarse
meal.) Sprinkle water, 1 tablesp. at a time, over different parts of
mixture, tossing quickly with fork until all particles cling together
when pressed gently and form dough that clings to fork. (Use only
enough water to make particles cling together-they should not be wet
or slippery. Amount may vary with flour.) Form pastry into ball;
divide in half for two-crust pie. (If very warm day, refrigerate 1/2
hr. before rolling.) Roll out on lightly floured surface. (For
two-crust pie, roll out only half of pastry; now follow individual
pie recipe. For 8" or 9" baked pie shell, see below. )

Fit pastry into 8" or 9" pie plate and make attractive edge. Then,
with 4 tined fork, prick sides and bottom closely and deeply.
Refrigerate 1/2 hr. Bake at 450Ã¸ F. 12 to 15 min., or till golden.
Peek after 5 min.; if bubbles appear, prick. Cool on wire rack before
filling.
