Tommy Toy's combines French and Chinese  food in this restaurant
which is patterned after the reading room of the Dowager Empress of
China. The kitchen is Asian but the menu reflects both traditions.
1-Preheat a wok or large skillet over highest heat until very hot.

Add the vegetable oil, tilt the wok to coat, then quickly add the
eggs and stir, scrambling the eggs. 2-Add the cooked rice, stir
quickly. Add the vegetables and salt to taste. Stir and toss to blend
quickly. Add the sesame oil and soy sauce, toss to combine flavors,
for about 2 minutes.
