and simmer.

Make the balls ( recipe follows ) while it's simmering. When
vegetables are half cooked add the dolma balls gently, one at a time,
on a spoon. Make sure they are well covered with liquid as they will
double in size. Add a little water or stock if needed to cover. Let
simmer for 10 minutes then add zucchini and cilantro and simmer until
balls are firm and rice in middle is soft.  Check while cooking and
add more liquid if needed. Dolma: ------ Put all ingredients into a
bowl and mix thoroughly the roll into walnut-sized balls and set
aside.
