1.  Rinse turkey under cold running water and pat dry with paper
towels. 2. Preheat oven to 325F.  Pour 1/2 cup stock into roasting
pan. Heavily butter roasting rack and set in pan. Fill turkey loosely
with stuffing. 3. Combine garlic, basil, salt, pepper, rosemary,
marjoram and thyme. Rub some of the butter over turkey. Sprinkle
evnly with herb mixture. 4. Place turkey breast side down on rack and
roast for 20 minutes. 5. Melt remaining butter in small saucepan over
medium-low heat. Remove from heat and add wine. 6. After 20 minutes,
baste turkey generously with butter and wine mixture and continue
roasting according to wrapper directions. (If there are no directions
with turkey, allow about 15 to 18 minutes per pound). Baste turkey
generously with remaining wine mixture and pan juices every 30
minutes or so, checking occasionally to make sure breast skin is not
sticking to roasting rack.  Add additional 1/2 cup of stock if more
liquid is needed for basting.   Cover turkey loosely with foil if it
begins to brown too quickly. 7. During the last hour of cooking, turn
turkey breast side up.  Test for doneness by moving leg; if it
wiggles easily, turkey is done.  A meat thermometer inserted into
thigh should read 180F to 185F. 8. Transfer turkey to large heated
platter and cover loosely with foil. Let stand in warm place 15 to 20
minutes. 9. Meanwhile, prepare Giblet Gravy. To serve: Garnish
platter with large clusters of grapes set on bed of pine boughs.
Serves 8-10, with leftovers.
