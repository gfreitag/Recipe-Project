* I find the easiest way to mince lemon grass is to peel away the
tough
outer leaves and put the bulb end through the slicer on my food
processor.  Save the green tops to cut up and add to soups, etc.

Combine all salad ingredients and toss gently.  Place about a cup of
the salad mixture in individual bowls.  Top with about two cups of
the noodles. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a wok or nonstick fry pan over moderate heat.  Tilt
the pan to evenly coat the entire surface.  Wait for the oil to get
hot, then add the onion, garlic, and lemon grass.  Stir-fry about 10
seconds. Working very quickly, add the chili paste and black
mushrooms.  Add the say sauce, salt, and sugar and stir a few times.
Add the carrots and prawns and cook until both are almost cooked, 2
minutes.  Add the white mushrooms and chicken stock.  Cook until
mushrooms begin to wilt, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat.

To serve, place the prawns and vegetables on top of the noodles.
Garnish with chopped peanuts and cilantro.  Invite guests to add 3-4
tablespoons of Vietnamese dipping sauce to their noodels and toos
gently before eating.

Vietnamese Dipping Sauce: Place garlic, chili paste and chili in a
mortar. With a pestle, pound into a paste. (If you do not have a
mortar & pestle, finely mince the garlic and chili.)

Combine the garlic mixture with the remaining ingredients in a small
mixing bowl.  Stir until the sugar has dissolved.  Ladle sauce into
serving bowls and float the carrot slivers on top.
