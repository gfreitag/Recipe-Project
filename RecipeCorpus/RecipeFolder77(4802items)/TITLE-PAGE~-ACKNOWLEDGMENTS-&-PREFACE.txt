Yield: 1 Text  COMPLETE GUIDE TO HOME CANNING

Caution: To prevent the risk of botulism, low-acid and tomato foods
not canned according to the recommendations in this publication or
according to other USDA-endorsed recommendations should be boiled
even if you detect no signs of spoilage.  At altitudes below 1,000
feet, boil foods for 10 minutes.  Add an additional minute of boiling
time for each additional 1,000 ft. elevation.

Reference to commercial products and services is made with the
understanding that no discrimination is intended and no endorsement
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is implied. Clear Jel
(registered trademark) is mentioned because it is the only suitable
product that is presently available to the general public through
distributors of speciality products.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The creation of an Extension Service Center for Excellence at the Penn
State University made it possible to conduct the research necessary to
revise four previously published bulletins for canning foods in the
home. The Center, no longer in operation, was a cooperative effort of
the Extension Service, Cooperative State Research Service, and the
Penn State University with Gerald D. Kuhn, Ph.D., of the Penn State
University as Director.

The Extension Services wishes to credit the primary development of
this guide to Gerald D. Kuhn, Elizabeth L. Andress (currently with the
University of Georgia), and Thomas S. Dimick. Extension staff who
assisted in preparing this guide include Milton P. Baldauf, Catherine
E. Adams, Nancy T. Sowers, and Vincent G. Hughes. Extension staff who
assisted in this revision include Kenneth N. Hall (University of
Connecticut) and Thomas W. Poore.  All have contributed significant
ideas and time in making this guide a truly up-to-date research-based
publication.

PREFACE

Home canning has changed greatly in the 170 years since it was
introduced as a way to preserve food. Scientists have found ways to
produce safer, higher quality products. Section 1 of this guide
explains the scientific principles of on which canning techniques are
based, discusses canning equipment, and describes the proper use of
jars and lids. It describes basic canning ingredients and procedures
and how to use them to achieve safe, high-quality canned products.
Finally, it helps you decide whether or not and how much to can.

The other six sections of this guide contain a series of factsheets
for specific foods. These factsheets offer detailed directions for
making sugar syrups; and for canning fruits and fruit products,
tomatoes and tomato products, vegetables, red meats, poultry,
seafoods, and pickles and relishes. Handy guidelines for choosing the
right quantity and quality of raw food accompany each set of
directions for fruits, tomatoes and vegetables. Most recipes are
designed to yield a full canner load of pints or quarts. Finally
processing adjustments for altitudes above sea level are given for
each food.

This publication contains many new research-based recommendations for
canning safer and better food at home.. It is an invaluable resource
for persons who are canning for the first time. Experienced canners
will find updated information to help them improve their canning
practices. =======================================================
