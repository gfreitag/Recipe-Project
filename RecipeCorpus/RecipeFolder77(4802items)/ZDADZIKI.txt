is pungent with garlic, and fresh mint adds to its refreshing quality.

Grate the cucumber on the coarse side of the grater. place it in a
sieve and press the water out with the back of a spoon. Dry the
grated cucumber on kitchen paper.

Then mix all the ingredients together and chill for at least 2 hours
before serving. Serve with warm pitta bread.
