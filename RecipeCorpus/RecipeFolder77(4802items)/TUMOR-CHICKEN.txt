Title: TUMOR CHICKEN
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Or 2 roasting chickens
Garlic cloves
Peel the garlic cloves (leaving them whole) and after loosening the
skin of the birds insert them under the skin, using as many as you
like, but at least 6-7 cloves for each bird. I use a Weber, and build
an indirect pile against one side of the grill, meanwhile have
several chunks of Hickory soaking in water, when the coals are ready,
put the hickory on, brush with soy sauce if you like,(not necessary)
Put the birds on the opposite side from the coals, adjust the vents
and go about your business. Usually takes about 2 hours.

I realize that this is not really smoke cooking and therefore may be
outside the scope of this group, but if you make and eat it I think
you will be happy to add it to your repetoire.
