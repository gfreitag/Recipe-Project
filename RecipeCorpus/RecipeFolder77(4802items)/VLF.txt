Title: VLF: SUPER BOWL BROWNIES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Flour
1 c  Cocoa
1 pn Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Almond extract
4    Egg whites at room temp
1 c  Honey
These are extremely low in fat, and the taste is more slightly bitter
dark chocolate than the milk-chocolate sweet of most brownies,
however if you love chocolate, they're a great treat!

In a large bowl sift flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and packed
brown sugar. In small bowl beat until creamy vanilla, almond extract,
egg whites and honey.

Combine and mix well.  Pour into a 13 x 9 baking pan sprayed with
non-stick spray.  Bake at 375 (350 glass) 15-20 minutes. Poke with a
toothpick and if it comes out with fudgy crumbs, it's done.

Do not overbake!  Cool completely before cutting into pieces. You can
add chopped nuts, however it will raise the fat content substantially.
