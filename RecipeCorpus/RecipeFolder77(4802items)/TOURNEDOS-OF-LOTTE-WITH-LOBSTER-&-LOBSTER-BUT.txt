For Lobster Butter: ===================

Steam or boil lobsters until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes.

Cool, then remove all lobster meat from shells. Refrigerate meat,
covered; set aside.

In large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons clarified butter. Add
onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, tarragon, and bay leaf; toss
over high heat 3 minutes.

Add lobster shells, stirring; then add 2 tablespoons Cognac and
stir for 3 minutes.

Add butter and tomato paste and simmer gently, covered, 2 to 3
hours.

Strain, pressing solids firmly.  Set aside for 15 minutes.

Skim any froth from surface and strain again through several
layers of dampened cheesecloth, leaving behind any milky residue in
bottom of pan (discard residue.) Cool, then chill or freeze in small
containers.

For Lotte and Sauce: ====================

Pat lotte dry; sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Heat 1/2 cup clarified butter in heavy large skillet over medium
high heat.  Working in batches if necessary, saute lotte until
lightly golden, about 2 minutes per side. Scatter shallot around fish
and cook 2 minutes longer.

Pour in 1/2 cup Cognac and cook 1 minute longer. Transfer to warm
serving plates and keep warm.

Add 1 cup cream to skillet and reduce by half.

Add remaining cup and boil until thick enough to coat a spoon
lightly. Lower heat and spoon in the 1/2 cup lobster butter a little
at a time, whisking constantly.

Strain sauce into clean saucepan.  Cut reserved lobster meat into
thick slices and add.  Simmer gently
2    minutes.

Place lobster pieces between pieces of lotte. Nap with sauce;
garnish with parsley and serve immediately.
