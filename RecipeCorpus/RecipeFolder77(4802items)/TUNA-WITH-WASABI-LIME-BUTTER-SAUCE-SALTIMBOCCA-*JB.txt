Prepare grill.

Arrange tuna steaks in one layer in a shallow dish and lightly brush
both sides with oil. Spread peppercorns and dill evenly on both sides
of tuna and marinate for 20 minutes.

Grill tuna on an oiled rack set about 5 to 6 inches over glowing
coals 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare fish. (Alternatively,
grill tuna in a preheated oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan.)

Serve tuna with sauce.

Make sauce while tuna marinates: In a heavy saucepan combine
scallions, coriander, lime juice, soy sauce, and wasabi paste and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 piece at a
time, lifting pan from heat occasionally to cool mixture and adding
each new piece before previous one has melted completely. (Do not
allow sauce to simmer. Sauce should not get hot enough to separate.)
