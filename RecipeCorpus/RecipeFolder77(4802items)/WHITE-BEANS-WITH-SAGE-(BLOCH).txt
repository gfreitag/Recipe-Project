There have been a number of good polenta suggestions...here is one
that we enjoyed earlier this summer. It was one of those hot days, so
I chilled the polenta in a loaf pan, and just sliced it (without
dry-frying or anything). On top I put white beans and sage. It's an
adaptation of a recipe from Fields of Greens (called Warm Cannellini
Beans with Sage, p. 270, for those of you with this cookbook)

Put the beans into a saucepan with the bay leaf, savory and two of
the sage leaves.  Warm gently until you need them, so that they take
in the herb flavors. Remove the herbs and bay leaf, leave the beans
in their broth.

While the beans cook, chop the remaining sage leaves. Water-saute the
onion, 1/2 t salt, and a few pinches of pepper. Saute (I'll probably
use water next time; I tried wine, but I thought it made the whole
thing to wine-y.) over medium heat until the onion begins to release
its juices. Add the garlic and sage; saute for about 10 minutes, then
add the wine and cook for a minute or two, until the pan is nearly
dry.

Add the beans and their broth to the onions along with 1/2 t salt and
a few pinches of pepper.  Lower the heat and cook for 20 minutes,
adding alittle water if needed to keep the beans saucy. Add salt and
pepper to taste. Add the parsley just before serving.
