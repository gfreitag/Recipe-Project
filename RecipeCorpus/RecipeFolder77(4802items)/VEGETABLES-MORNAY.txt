sauce. Save preparation time by using prepackaged frozen vegetables.

Stir in mushrooms. Meanwhile, melt margarine in small saucepan over
medium heat. Stir in flour, salt, nutmeg and pepper; cook until
smooth and bubbly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Gradually
stir in milk. Cook over medium heat until thickened, stirring
constantly. Remove from heat; stir in Parmesan cheese. Pour over

Frozen vanilla yogurt is the surprise ingredient in this satisfying,
but not sinfully sweet, pumpkin pie.
