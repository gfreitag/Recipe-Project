Title: WHOLE WHEAT PIZZA CRUST
Categories: Breads, Ethnic
Yield: 2 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
-(105 to 115 F)
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
2 ts Salt
4 ts Cornmeal (optional)
Stir yeast into warm water and set aside for 5 to 10 minutes.
Combine the flours and salt in a mixer bowl; add yeast mixture. Mix
until dough begins to pull away from side of bowl. (Add a little more
flour if dough sticks to side.)  Divide dough in half.  On a floured
surface with floured rolling pin, roll each half into a 15-inch
circle (dough should overlap pan by 1 inch all around). If dough
resists rolling, let it rest a few minutes and try again. Dough can
be refrigerated or frozen before rolling. Thaw thoroughly before
attempting to roll out.
Coat two nonstick 14-inch pizza pans with cooking spray and
sprinkle with cornmeal (optional). Arrange each crust in a prepared
pan and top as desired.
