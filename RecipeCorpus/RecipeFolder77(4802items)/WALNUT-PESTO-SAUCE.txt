Title: WALNUT PESTO SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Pasta
1/2 c  broken walnuts
Yield: 1 1/2 c
1 lg garlic clove,
chopped
:
2 c  packed fresh
basil leaves
:
1/4 ts salt
1 c  packed Italian
flat-leaf parsley
:
3/4 c  olive oil
1/3 c  grated Parmesan cheese

Finely chop the walnuts and the garlic in a food processor; add half
the basil and the salt;  coarsely chop. Add the remaining basil and
the parsley.  With the food processor running, add the oil in a slow
steady stream through the feed tube until mixture is thoroughly
blended. Transfer to a bowl; fold in the cheese. Remove 1/2 cup of
the pasta cooking liquid before draining the pasta.  Toss hot pasta
with the sauce and the reserved cooking liquid.  Serve at once with
additional cheese, if desired. Note: taste and adjust salt and add
pepper)

I grow basil in a very large pot during the spring and summer and
make a lot of batches of pesto (omitting the cheese) and freeze
individually in small Dixie cups. After it is frozen, I remove from
the cups and wrap in Saran Wrap, then place in a freezer Ziploc. To
serve defrost as many "pesto patties" as you need and follow above
directions remembering to save the pasta water and add cheese.  I
also use 4 cloves of garlic in this recipe (we love garlic) and add
more salt and pepper. Enjoy! Walt MM
