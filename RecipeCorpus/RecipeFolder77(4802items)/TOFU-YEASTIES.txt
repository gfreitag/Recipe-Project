Title: TOFU YEASTIES
Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Firm Tofu
x  Nutritional Yeast
If you've tried tofu burgers you'll love Tofu Yeasties! They are also
quick and easy.

1.Slice firm tofu about 1/4 inch thick (to yield the largest patty).
Be sure to use a high quality firm tofu.

2.Dip the tofu slices in soy sauce (both sides).

3.Place the slices on a plate of nutritional yeast until they are
thoroughly breaded (don't use brewer's yeast unless you know the
difference!). I prefer to use Red Star brand nutritional yeast.

4.Fry both sides at medium high on a non-stick surface until light
brown. No oil is required.

5.Serve as you would any veggiburger.
