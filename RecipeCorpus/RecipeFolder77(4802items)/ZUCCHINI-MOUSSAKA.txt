Categories: Vegetables, Greek
Yield: 6 Servings
4 tb Olive oil; divided
6 md Zucchini; sliced lengthwise
6 tb Butter, sweet; divided
1 lg Onion, yellow; finely chopt
1    Garlic clove; minced
1 1/2 lb Lamb shoulder, lean & ground
1 1/2 ts Oregano, dried, crumbled

1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground

4 tb Flour, all purpose
1 1/2 c  Milk
8 oz Feta; crumbled & divided
1    Egg; lightly beaten
In a heavy, 12 inch skillet heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over
moderate heat for 1 minute. Saute the zucchini in batches until
lightly browned on both sides, adding remaining oil as needed. With a
slotted spatula transfer zucchini to a platter lined with paper
towels. In the same skillet add 2 tablespoons of the butter over
moderate heat. Add onion and garlic and saute, stirring  for 1
minute. Add the lamb, oregano, salt, cinnamon, mutmeg and pepper.
Cook uncovered, stirring occasion- ally, until the lamb is brown,
about 7 minutes. Drain off fat. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small
heavy saucepan melt the remaining butter over medium-low heat. Whisk
in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Gradually
add the milk and egg, stirring constantly, until the sauce has
thickened--3 to 4 minutes. In a greased, 13 X 9 X 2 inch baking dish
arrange half of the zucchini in an even layer. Top with the lamb
mixture and half of the feta cheese. Cover with the remaining
zucchini and feta. Pour the sauce over all. Bake uncovered until
golden and bubbling--50 minutes to 1 hour.
