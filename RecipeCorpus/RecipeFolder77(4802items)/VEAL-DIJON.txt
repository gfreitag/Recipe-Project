Title: VEAL DIJON
Categories: Meats
Yield: 2 Servings

2 oz Shallots
1 tb Pepper
2 oz Honey
2 oz White wine
1 oz Butter
1 tb Salt
4 oz Dijon mustard

The cut of veal you use will make a difference in the length of
time it takes to cook this.  If you use stew meat, plan on letting it
stew in its juices for up to 1 hour. If you use medallions or better
cuts, it will go quickly.
In a heavy bottomed pan saute the butter and shallots and add the
vea or medallions.  The cubes need to simmer, the medallions will be
five minutes or so. Remove meat from pan and hold. Deglaze the pan
with a little wine. Mix the mustard and honey.  Add the cream and
reduce to desired thickness. Season with salt and pepper. Add sauce
to meat, heat back together and serve. Serves 2
