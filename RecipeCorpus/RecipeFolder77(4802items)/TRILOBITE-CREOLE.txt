*If trilobites are out of season or extinct in your area, shrimp or
crawfish may be substitued.

Peel and devein the trilobites. Place heads (if you still have them),
and peels in a small saucepan and add water. Bring to a slow boil over
medium-high heat and boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain and
discard the heads and peels. Retain the stock.

Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place over
medium-high heat. Add the onions, peppers and celery and saute,
stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar and shrimp stock
and return to simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 2
hours, stirring occasionally. This is your creole sauce and it can be
prepared 1-2 days in advance and stored in the 'fridge. The flavors
improve after sitting a couple of days.

When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add the
trilobites. Cook until they turn pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the
green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on
rice.
