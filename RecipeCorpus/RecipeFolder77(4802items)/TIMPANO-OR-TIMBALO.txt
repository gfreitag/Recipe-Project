Preparation:

1. Oil the pan or wash-basin generously with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive
oil so that the phyllo dough will not stick. Line the pan with phyllo
dough, leaving at least 6" overlay to drape the timpano.

2. Layer the filling as you would with lasagne, but press down with
your hands so the timpano will hold and it will be well defined.

3. Add lightly sauced penne about 2" or so. Add various grilled
vegetables in a single layer.

4. Sprinkle with Parmesan and drizzle about 3/4 cup of marinara sauce
over the first layer.

5. Add 1/2 of the hard-boiled eggs, cut-side down.

6. Repeat layers until pan is filled.

7. Add beaten eggs which will set the timpano. Fold overlay over
bottom of timpano.

8. Bake on middle rack of 350 degree oven for 1 1 1/2 hours until
crust is golden. Check timpano after 45 minutes. If the top layer is
cooking too rapidly, lightly cover with foil.

9. The recipe may be altered with the ingredients of your choice.
