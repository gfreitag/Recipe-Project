Title: WINE COOLER
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
Yield: 6 Servings
2 oz Wine
5 oz Lemon-lime soft drink (e.g.,
-7-UP, Sprite, Slice)
Ice cubes  (opt.)
Mix wine and soft drink. Pour into 8 oz glass. Add ice. (750 ml wine
to 2 liter soft drink = 8 wine coolers you buy.)

This recipe makes wine coolers very similar to the ones you buy.
I usually use a cheap wine with lots of berry flavor.
