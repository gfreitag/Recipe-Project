1    3" stick of cinnamon
1    2" piece dried ginger root
4    Coriander seeds

Wash, core and bake the apples at 350F. for 30 to 45 minutes or until
tender, but not mushy. Tie all of the whole spices together in a
cheesecloth bag. Combine the water and sugar in a large pot. Add the
spice bag, grated nutmeg and mace. Bring to a boil, stirring until
sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add
the ale and sherry. Heat to just below the boiling point. Meanwhile,
beat the egg whites until stiff and beat the egg yolks until thick.
Fold the whites into the yolks in a heatproof punch bowl. Remove the
spice bag and add the heated liquid very gradually to the eggs,
stirring briskly after each addition. Float the roasted apples on
top. Serve hot. Yields 12 servings.
