4 oz White mushrooms

Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Oil
1/3 c  Finely minced onion
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
1/2 c  Dry white wine or broth
5 c  Broth
1/4 c  Mascarpone cheese
-=OR=- Whipping cream

1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 tb Chopped parsley
You can substitute dried wild mushrooms for the shiitake. Just soak
them for 15-to-20 minutes beforehand (and be sure to add the strained
soaking liquid to the stock). HEAT BUTTER in small skillet over
moderate heat. When it begins to foam, add mushrooms and cook for
3-to-5 minutes, until soft. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn off
heat and set aside. Bring the broth to a steady simmer in a saucepan
on top of the stove. Heat butter and oil in heavy 4-quart casserole
over moderate heat. Add onion, saute for 1-to-2 minutes, until it
begins to soften, being careful not to brown. Add rice to
butter-oil-onion mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir 1 minute, making
sure all grains are well coated. Add wine and stir until completely
absorbed. Add simmering broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring
frequently. Wait until each addition is almost completely absorbed
(approximately 2 minutes) before adding next 1/2 cup, reserving 1/4
cup to add at the end. Stir often. After approximately 18 minutes
(rice should be tender and firm), add 1/4 cup broth, mushrooms,
Mascarpone and Parmesan cheeses and stir vigorously so cheeses melt.
Sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.
