Title: YOGURT BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Quickbread
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Yogurt
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3/4 c  Brown sugar
1    Egg
1 c  Natural bran
1 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Berries/peaches/raisins
Combine yogurt and soda.  Use a big bowl - it foams.

Mix oil, sugar, eggs, and bran.  Add yogurt.

Add flour, baking powder, and salt.  Fold in fruit.

Raisins are good with strawberry or raspberry yogurt. Otherwise, match
yogurt to fruit.

*Note:  At work (where I got this), my boss saves up odds and ends of
yogurt all week, and she dumps them all together to make this
brown-looking mess of yogurt. It doesn't taste different in the
muffins, though, and you can toss in any kind of fruit with it.
