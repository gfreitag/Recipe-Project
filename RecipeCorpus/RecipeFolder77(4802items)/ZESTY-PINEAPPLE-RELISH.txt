garlic, chilies and tangy lime juice. The heat of the chili is in the
seeds and ribs, so remove them before mincing (wear rubber gloves).

2. Toss in minced chili, garlic, lime zest and lime juice. Cover and
refrigerate up to 2 hours before use.

3. Add basil and cilantro just before serving. Serve chilled.
