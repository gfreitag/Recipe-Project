Zucchini Crust Pizza (Merrilyn Vaughan)

This is something my mother makes which even *I* like [and I don't
like 'chini!]  Got her to send it to me just for you folks!

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Press liquid out of squash. Throw out
liquid. Combine zucchini, eggs, flour and salt. Spread on a well
greased 9" x 12" baking sheet or 12" pizza pan.  Bake until firm.

Remove from oven.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Spread with
pizza sauce and favorite toppings. Sprinkle with your favorite cheese.
Return to oven. Bake until sauce is bubbly and cheese is melted,
about 10 to 15 minutes.
