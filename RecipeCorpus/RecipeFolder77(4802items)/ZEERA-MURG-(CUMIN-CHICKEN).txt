Title: ZEERA MURG (CUMIN CHICKEN)
Categories: India, Chicken, Curries
Yield: 8 Servings
2 kg Chicken thigh
Cutlets or breasts,
Whole or in fine
Strips (4.5 lb)
Juice of 2 lemons
1 ts Salt
2 ts Cayenne
3 oz Flour
6 oz Butter
2    Onions, finely sliced
2 cl Garlic, crushed
2 1/2    Inch piece root ginger,
Finely chopped
2 ts Cumin seeds
500 ml Yoghurt* (1 pint)
150 ml Fresh cream* (or equal
Quantity of sour light
Cream) (1/2 cup)
1 cn Coconut cream (if mixture
Seems too dry through
Prolonged cooking)
Thinly pared rind of
1 lemon, in 1 piece
(ho ho ho..if you can
Achieve this you are
Truly exceptional)
Place chicken on a large plate and rub over with lemon juice. Set
aside for at least 20 minutes, then pat fry with kitchen paper. Mix
salt, cayenne and flour on a plate and dredge chicken pieces, shaking
off excess. Melt butter in pan, add the chicken and fry until
browned. Add onions, garlic, ginger and cumin seeds and fry until
golden brown. Stir in yoghurt, cream and lemon rind.  Return chicken
to mixture and mix until all chicken is well coated.  Bring to the
boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour or until chicken
is cooked. Uncover the pan for the last 20 minutes, to allow sauce to
reduce.  Discard lemon rind (if you can find it) before serving.

I found that the mixture was too dry for the quantity of chicken, so
I used additional yoghurt/sour cream and the coconut cream to get the
consistency I liked. WALT
