Title: TOMATO SAUCE WITH ORANGE & BASIL
Categories: Fruits, Seasonings, Italian, Sauces
Yield: 1 Batch
2 lb Italian plum tomatoes
-- cored & coarsely chopped
2 tb Fruity olive oil
2    Garlic cloves
-- minced or pressed
1 c  Carrot; shredded
1/2 c  Onion; chopped
1 tb + 2 tsp. grated orange peel
-- (colored part only)
1/4 c  Fresh basil; chopped
Salt and pepper; to taste
Saute garlic in olive oil for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add carrots and onion
and saute until soft and tender. Add tomatoes, cover, and simmer (do
not boil) for 20 minutes. Uncover, add orange peel and basil, and
simmer another 20 minutes.

At this point, sauce can be processed through a food mill for a
smooth, creamy texture or left as is for a more robust sauce. In
either case, cook another 10 to 15 minutes until sauce is thickened,
adding salt and pepper.

The editors wrote: "The appeal of this sauce lay in its freshness,
simplicity and secret ingredient - orange peel. Michael serves it over
fish, meat or vegetables, as well as angel-hair pasta."
