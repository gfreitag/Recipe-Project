Title: VEGEBURGERS
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Green lentils
3    Medium-sized carrots
3 sl Bread
1    Onion
1    Clove garlic
1 oz Or so parsley (could be
Omitted, or you could use
Cilantro)
1    Egg
Seasoning to taste
Little wholemeal flour to
Coat (may not be necessary)
Boil lentils for 20 minutes in water, drain, and mash gently - not too
hard, as you want some of them to stay whole. While they are cooking,
peel and grate the carrots, make the bread into crumbs, and finely
chop the onion, parsley and garlic.  Mix these and the seasoning with
the mashed lentils, and bind together with egg. Form into burgers or
rissoles or whatever you call the things, coat with flour - I still
don't know if this is necessary - and cook under the grill (broiler)
for 5 minutes each side. *Tomato sauce made like this: 1 onion 1
clove garlic 1 tbs tomato puree (paste) 1 tin tomatoes A little extra
water Seasoning. Microwave onion and garlic for about 3 minutes;
transfer to saucepan with the tomato puree, stir, add tinned tomatoes
and a little water, season, bring to the boil and simmer for about 15
minutes.  If it's a bit liquid, boil harder to reduce - get it to the
sort of consistency you would like, bearing in mind you have brown
rice to moisten!
