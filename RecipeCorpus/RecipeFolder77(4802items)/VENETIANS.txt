Fold into almond mixture until well blended.  Divide mixture into
three equal portions. Spread uncolored (yellow-ish) dough into one
jelly roll pan. Add green color to one portion and mix well.  Spread
green into second pan. Add red color to final portion and spread in
last pan. Bake for 13 minutes or until edges are golden brown (Do not
overbake).

Immediately remove the cakes from pans using the foil overhang.  Heat
apricot preserves in microwave for two minutes on high and press
through seive.  Place green layer on another jelly roll pan and
spread half of the preserves on top all the way to the edges.  Slide
yellow layer on top of green and spread the remaining preserves on
top of the yellow layer - all the way to the edges.  Slide pink layer
on top of the yellow layer. Cover top with plastic wrap and weight
with heavy bread board. Refrigerate overnight.  Melt chocolate in
microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute and stir til smooth.  Spread
melted chocolate to edges of pink layer. Let chocolate harden and
then cut into 1 inch squares. After cooled, it's nice to pipe small
decorations onto the cut squares (snowmen or xmas trees or any
seasonal design)
