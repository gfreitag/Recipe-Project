These delightfully decadent brownies were created by Chef Emeril
Lagasse at his restaurant Emeril's, in New Orleans' Warehouse
District.

Preheat the oven to 325F. Grease an 8x10x2 baking pan. Melt the
butter in a double boiler; add the white chocolate and melt
completely.

In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and salt until frothy. Add the
sugar, and beat until thick and pale, about 90 seconds. Scrape down
the sides. Add the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture and beat for
five seconds. Add the flour and mix until just moist. Fold in the
nuts with a spatula and pour into the prepared pan. Place in the oven
and bake for 40 minutes. Let cool for 1 hour. To serve, drizzle the
top with the sauce.

The Sauce In a double boiler, gently melt the white chocolate. Add the
cream and butter and cook briefly until smooth. Let cool a little.
Either spoon over brownies, or use a squeeze bottle to sauce the
brownies. Walt MM
