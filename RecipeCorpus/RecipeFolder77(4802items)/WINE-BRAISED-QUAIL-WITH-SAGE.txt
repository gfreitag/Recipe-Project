8    Quail, skinned and trimmed
-of fat
1/4 c  All-purpose white flour
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper to taste
1 tb Olive oil
1 c  Dry white wine
2    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
-seeded and finely chopped
4 ts Chopped fresh sage
This sophisticated dish is deceptively simple to prepare. Two Cornish
game hens may be substituted for the quail. Skin and halve them
before cooking, and braise them for 35 to 40 minutes.

Tie quad legs together and tuck the wing tips under the bird. Combine
flour, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge the
quail in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet let
over medium-high heat and brown the birds well on all sides, for 5 to
6 minutes. Pour off any fat.

Add wine, tomatoes and sage, and boil for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat
to low, cover and cook, turning occasionally, until the birds are
tender and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove the birds
to a warm platter.

Boil the sauce over medium-high heat until it thickens and is slightly
reduced, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and
nap the quail with the sauce.
