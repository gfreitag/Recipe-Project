Title: YUMMY BAKED (OVERCOOKED) POTATOES <T>
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Baking Potatoes
Scrub potatoes well and pierce several times with a fork. Microwave on
baked potato setting or on med. high for approximately 15 mins.,
until firm but not hard. Increase time if you are making several
potatoes.

Put in 425 degree oven directly on the rack or in the toaster oven on
the tray covered with foil (or place on a small foil pan) and bake
one to one and a half hours skin is VERY crunchy.

The inside will be very soft and sweet.  Can be refrigerated and
reheated in the oven until the skin is crunchy again, about 20-30
minutes at 425.
