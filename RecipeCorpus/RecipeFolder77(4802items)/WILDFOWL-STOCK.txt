Title: WILDFOWL STOCK
Categories: Game, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 3 Quarts
3 qt Cold water
5 lb Game bird carcass, wings,
-legs, neck, other spare
-parts
2    Or 3 stalks wild celery,
-cut in chunks
1/2 c  Wild onions, chopped
1/2 c  Wild carrots, chopped
1 sm Bunch watercress
Place cold water in a soup pot.  Place game bird pieces in cold
water. Soak for 1 hour.  Add other ingredients. Do not stir. Soak for
1 hour. Place pot, uncovered, at the back of a cook stove far from
the fire. On a conventional stove, place the pot on an asbestos pad
over very low heat.

Allow pot and it's contents to warm very slowly.  You need to draw as
much as possible out of the ingredients and into the stock. Skim off
scum as it rises.  When the pot is uniformly warm, move it closer to
the fire (or increase the heat) and very slowly and carefully bring
the liquid to a simmer.  Do not boil. Do not rush. Skim off all the
scum immediately, as it rises within the first 30 minutes of
simmering.  After 30 minutes and after skimming, use a clean piece of
cheesecloth to wipe the pot at the level of the liquid.

Simmer very gently, uncovered, for at least 3 hours.

Taking great care not to disturb the ingredients, carefully ladle the
liquid through clean, moistened cheesecloth into a large screw-lid
jar. Do not pour the stock. Leave the unstrained stock uncovered
until cool. Cover cooled stock tightly and store in refrigerator. Do
not remove grease at this time.

Skim grease from stock.  Reheat for use, or freeze.

This is from the cookbook on wild foods.  I've copied as it's written
because I found the style of writing and ingredients interesting. If
you try to use wild ingredients, be careful. I seem to remember that
both wild onions and wild carrots have close relatives that look much
the same but are toxic.  Personally, I'd do my stalking at the
supermarket.
