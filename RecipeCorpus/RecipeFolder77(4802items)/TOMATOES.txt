Blanching and concaise:
Yield: 4 Servings  :
1    2 Italian Roma tomatoes
1    2 beef steak tomatoes
1    2 yellow tomatoes

Bring a pot of water to a boil. With a paring knife, cut out the core
of the tomato. Turn the tomato over and cross slash the bottom of the
tomato. Immerse the tomato in boiling water for about 10 seconds,
depending on the ripeness, or until the skin starts to curl and
blister. Remove the tomatoes from the water and shock in an ice-bath.
Using a knife, peel the skin off the tomatoes. To seed the tomato,
gently squeeze the seeds out. For concaise, using a French knife, cut
the tomato in half, slice, and roughly chop
