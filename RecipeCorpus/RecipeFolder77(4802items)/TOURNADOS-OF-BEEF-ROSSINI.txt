Title: TOURNADOS OF BEEF ROSSINI
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Jrb
Yield: 1 Servings
1    3-4 ounce Filet Mignon
1/3 c  Bearnaise Sauce
1    English Muffin
1 md Tomato
2    Toothpicks :)
1/2 c  Grated parmesean cheese
Split a good 3 1/2 or 4 ounce Filet Mignon in 2 medallions (disks) and
broil or charbroil to desired degree. Place each half on crisply
toasted english muffin. (I have used fried rounds of a good dense
french bread) Cover it all with a generous portion of Bearnaise sauce
and top with "crown" of tomato.

To make the crown, hold the tomato on it's side and jab the point of a
paring knife straight thru the tomato at a 45 degree angle to a line
running from top to bottom. repeat all around till you get back to
where you started. the tomato will fall apart. If not gently twist it
to separate the halves.

Your cut will look like this: /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

DIp the cut side into any decent grated parmasean cheese and slip
under the broiler for a few seconds to brown the cheese. Place the
tomato on top of the filet and secure it with a toothpick.

It's ready to serve.

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE =================

Separate 6 large eggs in a heat resistant bowl or double boiler. Melt
6 oz butter in a separate pan. Beat the yolks with a wire wisk, OVER
not in, boiling water until they begin to thicken. Very gradually add
the clarified butter in a thin stream while constantly beating the
mixture.

A good rule of thumb: 1 LARGE egg yolk will hold 1 to
1 1/2 oz of butter.

Be very careful to add the butter slowly and that the butter is not
hotter than the yolks or the sauce will "break" (begin to separate).
As soon as all the butter is incorporated, remove the bowl from the
heat source and keep beating to cool the sauce. Whip in the lemon
juice, cayenne, and white wine.

Variations on Hollandaise Sauce: Replace lemon juice with orange juice
concentrate for Maltese Sauce.

Replace juices and add tarragon, shallots, and basil for Bearnaise
sauce. (saute the tarragon, basil, and minced shallots in some of the
butter) See
