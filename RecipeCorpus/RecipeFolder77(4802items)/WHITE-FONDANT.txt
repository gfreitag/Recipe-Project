Title: WHITE FONDANT
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Pound
2 c  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Water
2 tb Corn syrup, light
1 ts Vanilla or lemon flavoring
Place a large platter in refrigerator to chill.

Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in saucepan. Cook, stirring
constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Remove spoon. Do not stir candy
again during cooking.

When candy begins to boil, cover saucepan tightly and let boil 3
minutes; the steam formed washes down any sugar crystals. Remove
cover; continue cooking. From time to time, wash away sugar crystals
which now appear on the sides of the saucepan. For this, use a fork
wrapped in a piece of cheesecloth and dipped in cold water. (Or--from
another recipe--use a wet pastry brush.)

Cook to soft ball stage, and 1 minute longer, or 240 F. on candy
thermometer, for firm fondant for molding. (At 238 F., which is soft
ball, fondant is suitable for coconut drops, layers in fudge, et
cetera.)

At 240 F. remove pan from heat; pour fondant at once onto cold, wet
platter. Let fondant cool to lukewarm. Add flavoring. Beat with
fondant paddle, spatula, or wide, flat wooden spoon until fondant
becomes white and creamy. Knead until the mass is smooth and no lumps
remain.

Put fondant away in covered glass bowl or jar to ripen for 2 or 3 days
before using. It may be kept longer if tightly covered. Use fondant as
suggested in various recipes.

"The home candymaker who likes to create professional-looking
chocolates and other candies must be able to make good fondant. This
recipe is simplified from a commercial formula. The fondant remains
creamy and workable. It may be shaped and dipped in chocolate. Some
may be colored with food coloring. Some may be combined with nuts,
coconut, chopped candied fruits or combined in layers with fudge,
caramels, and other mixtures to make logs, squares, and various
decorative pieces for the sweetmeat tray."
