Title: VEAL PICCATA WITH LEMON & CAPERS
Categories: Veal
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Butter, unsalted; room temp
2 1/2 tb Butter, unsalted; chilled &
-cut into pieces
2 tb Olive oil
1 lb Veal scaloppine, pounded
-very thin (1/16")
Salt; to taste
Pepper, white
1/4 c  Lemon juice
2 ts Capers; drained
2 ts Parsley, fresh; chopped
Lemon slices; for garnish
In a large nonreactive skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the room-temper-
ature butter in 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat. When the fat
is very hot, after about 3 minutes, lightly season a few slices of
the veal with salt and pepper.  Add just enough veal to fit
comfortably in the pan and cook until just browned, about 30 seconds
per side. Transfer the veal to a large platter.  Season and cook the
remaining veal in batches, adding the remaining oil and 1 tablespoon
room-temperature butter to the skillet as necessary.

When all the veal has been browned, pour the wine into the pan and
stir to deglaze, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. Cook
until the wine has reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon
juice and cook for 30 seconds longer.  Remove from the heat and stir
in the 2-1/2 tablespoons chilled butter to make a smooth sauce. Add
the capers and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add any
accumulated juices from the meat, then pour the sauce over the veal.
Sprinkle the parsley on top, garnish with lemon slices and serve at
once.

Note:  They note that homemade chicken stock could be used in place
of the wine to deglaze the pan.
