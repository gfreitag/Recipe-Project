Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING WITH WHITE CHOC
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Roll, 10" long and 2 1/2"
In diameter or the equi-
Valent amount of bread
2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
9 oz White chocolate, chopped
1    Egg
4    Egg yolks
Semi-sweet chocolate for
Garnish (optional)
Cut the roll into eight slices; place on middle rack of a 250F oven
and leave until dry, about 20 minutes. In a saucepan, heat 1 1/2 cups
of the heavy cream, the milk, and the sugar over low heat, stirring
until sugar is dissolved.  Add 5 oz. of the white chocolate, stir
until melted, and remove from the heat.  In a large bowl, whisk the
egg and yolks together. Whisk the chocolate mixture into the eggs a
little at a time. Tear the bread into 1" pieces, add to the white
chocolate custard, and stir to mix. Leave to soak, stirring
occasionally, until all the custard has been absorbed by the bread, 1
to 2 hours.  Put the mixture into an 8" square, 2" deep baking dish.
Put the dish in a slightly large pan and add hot water to come
halfway up the sides of the baking dish.  Bake the pudding in the
water bath at 350F for 45-50 minutes, until the custard is set and
the top is golden brown. Serve warm or cold. If you chill it, loosen
the sides with a metal spatula and invert the pudding onto a cutting
surface. Cut into four squares and cut each square into a triangle.
For the sauce, heat the remaining cream in a small pan.  Add the
remaining 4 oz. white chocolate and melt.  If desired, grate some
semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkle on top of the pudding.
