Rinse the herrings in cold water and cut the tails. Peel potatos and
cut in thin slices. Peel onions and cut in thin slices as well.

Take a heat-resistent dish and put in a layer of potatos. Then a
layer of herrings. Start with potatos and end with potatos. Put
pepper on every layer. Put in the cream till appr. 1 inch from the
top. Put on the breadcrumbs and spread little lumps of butter on top.

Put in a warm - 200 celsius - oven for about 40 minutes until the top

Serve with icecold Aquavit. That's a very strong Danish liquor.
