golden and crispy, about 15 minutes.
Sprinkle with salt.

2.  Combine all ingredients except pita bread and lettuce. Cover and
refrigerate for one hour to blend flavors.

3.  Line pita pockets with leaf lettuce and fill with tofu salad.

To press tofu, cut tofu block into 2 or 4 equal pieces and lay on a
plate covered with paper towels or a clean dish cloth. Cover with
more paper towels or dish cloth. Place another plate on top and on
top of the plate put a heavy object. Let stand from 20 minutes to one
hour, changing paper towels as they become soaked.
The longer you press, the firmer the tofu will be.
