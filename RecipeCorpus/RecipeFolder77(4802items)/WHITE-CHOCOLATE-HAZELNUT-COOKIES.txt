FROM:

Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 350Ã¸F. Lightly
butter baking sheets. In a double boiler over hot - not simmering -
water, melt the butter and 8 ounces of the white chocolate, stirring
frequently. Set aside and let cool until tepid.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Beat in the
sugars until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Blend
in the tepid white chocolate mixture and the vanilla.

In a double boiler over simmering water, melt the cream cheese,
stirring occasionally. Blend into the white chocolate mixture. In a
medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and cinnamon; blend into
the white chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining white chocolate,
semisweet chocolate, and hazelnuts. Spoon by heaping tablespoonfuls,
two inches apart, onto the prepared pans and bake until golden brown
and firm to the touch, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cookies to
wire racks and cool completely. Store in an airtight container at
room temperature.
