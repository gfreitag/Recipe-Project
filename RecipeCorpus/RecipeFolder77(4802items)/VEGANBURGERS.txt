Title: VEGANBURGERS
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Brown rice
2 1/2 c  Rolled oats
12 oz Ordinary white mushrooms
x  Large handful of dried
Shiitake mushrooms
3 md Onions
2    Bay leaves
1 tb Sage
1 tb Basil
1 tb Thyme
3 tb Cornstarch + just enough
Water to make a smooth
Paste
3 tb Dark soy sauce
cook brown rice as you would normally cook brown rice, and allow to
cool.

simmer onions and herbs in water until onions are soft. remove bay
leaves. save any broth.

soak shiitake mushrooms in water until they soften. simmer *all*
mushrooms in mushroom water until the fresh mushrooms are cooked
through. save mushroom sweat.

in a food processor, process 1/2 of the rice, 2 c. of the oats, and
all of the other ingredients until there are no big chunks. You may
have to do two batches depending on the size of your food processor.
Use mushroom water and onion liquid to keep the food processor happy.

in a large bowl, mix the processed gloop with remaining rice and
oats. It should be thick enough to form into cohesive patties, but
not dry. Add a few extra oats if it's too wet, or some liquid if your
hands don't get a little sticky when handling it.

fry in a light spray of Pam, over low heat, until both sides of the
patty are brown and crunchy.  about 10 min.

using a larger amount of mushrooms makes it taste even better, but
then the batter becomes more like thick pancake batter. Still yummy
though.
