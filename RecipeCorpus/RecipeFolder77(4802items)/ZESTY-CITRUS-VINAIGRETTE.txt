Here's a nifty idea for a homemade vinaigrette made with pectin. It
is from the July/August 1994 issue of Pillsbury Fast & Healthy.

This dressing lends zesty flavor with no fat. Serve it on a salad of
spinach leaves, mandarin orange segments, sliced celery and croutons.

Combine all ingredients in small jar with tight- fitting lid; shake to
blend well. 2/3 cup, 1 Tbsp per serving (8 calories, 0 g fat, 0 g
