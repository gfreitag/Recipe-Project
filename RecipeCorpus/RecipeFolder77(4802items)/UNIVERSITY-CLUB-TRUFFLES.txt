Title: UNIVERSITY CLUB TRUFFLES
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Serving
2 c  Heavy or whipping cream
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1 1/3 lb High quality dark chocolate;
-chopped
2 ts Grand Marnier
Coating (see note)
For the ganache or creamy truffle center, slowly bring cream, sugar
and butter to a boil in a heavy pan. Remove from heat. Add chopped
chocolate and Grand Marnier, stirring slowly until chocolate melts.
Refrigerate several hours until it is hard.

For truffles, pinch off the size you want (about size of walnut) and
roll into balls.  Do this quickly so that the heat of your hands
doesn't melt the ganache.

Roll balls in finely grated dark or milk chocolate, finely chopped
nuts, confectioners' sugar, powdered cocoa or a chocolate coating
(see note). Store at room temperature.

Note: Truffle centers can be dipped in quality chocolate that has been
tempered. (Tempered chocolate has been slowly heated and cooled so
that the fat content has become stable enough not to melt at room
temperature. This process is tricky, so Freddi Imel suggests using
melted chocolate chips, coating chocolate or melting pistals
available in baking sections or cake specialty stores).
