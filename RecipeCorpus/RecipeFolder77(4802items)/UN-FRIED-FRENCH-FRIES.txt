Title: UN-FRIED FRENCH FRIES
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 4 Servings
5    Large baking potatoes
(about 2 3/4 lbs total)
Light vegetable oil cooking
Spray
2    Large egg whites
1 tb Cajun spice
Preheat oven to 400F. Slice each potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch
ovals, then slice each oval lengthwise into matchsticks. Coat a
baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegetable oil. Combine the egg
whites and Cajun spice in a bowl.  Add the matchstick potatoes into
the prepared baking sheet and spread them out into a single layer,
leaving a little space between. Place the baking sheet on the bottom
shelf of the oven. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the fries are
crispy, turning them every 6 to 8 minutes with a spatula so that they
brown evenly. Serve immediately.
