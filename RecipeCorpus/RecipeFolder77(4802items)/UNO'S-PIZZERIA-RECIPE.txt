1    Oregano; fresh; chopped
1    Meat; choice
1    Onion; etc; choice
1    Parmesan; to taste
1    Romano cheese; to taste
Mix two packets of yeast in 2 cups of tepid water and let sit for ten
minutes.  Add 1/2 cup salad oil.   Add Olive oil, 3 cups flour;
cornmeal and salt.  Knead for about ten minutes. Add 2-1/2 cups of
additional flour. Knead this for 15 minutes.  Let dough rise to twice
its size. Use blackened deep dish pizza pans. I'm not sure how you
get 'em blackened - I cured mine with olive oil and then I just wipe
them out when I'm done. They are kind of getting blackened looking
with use. I have two pans and make two pizzas at a time. I spread the
pan with olive oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Divide the dough in
half. Spread and cover the bottom of the pan. Spread it up the sides.
I then let it rise again in the pan. Cover pizza dough with sliced
mozzarella. Drain and squash a 28 ounce can of plum tomatoes for each
pizza.  Drain off the excess fluid after squashing, and spread this
over the cheese. Smidge of salt and ground pepper over the top.
Chopped garlic, fresh chopped basil and oregano. Add the filling of
your choice (I use sliced onion and Italian Sausage). Top with a
Parmesan/Romano Cheese mix. Bake in preheated oven at 475 degrees for
35-40 minutes. ~--
