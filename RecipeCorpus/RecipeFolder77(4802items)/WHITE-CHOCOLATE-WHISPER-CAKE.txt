FROM:

Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F.  Grease and flour two 9 inch by
1-1/2    inch cake pans.

In a double boiler melt the chocolate over hot (not simmering) water,
stirring frequently. Remove from the water.

In a medium bowl lightly combine the egg whites, 1/4 cup milk, and
vanilla.

In a large mixing bowl combine the dry ingredients and mix on low
speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add the butter and remaining 3/4 cup
milk. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened.
Increase to medium speed (high speed if using a hand mixer) and beat
for 1-1/2 minutes to aerate and develop the cake's structure. Scrape
down the sides. Gradually add the egg mixture in 3 batches, beating
for 20 seconds after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and
strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides. Add the melted
chocolate and beat to incorporate.

Scrape the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with a
spatula. The pans will be about 1/2 full. Bake 25 to 35 minutes or
until a tester inserted near the center comes out clean and the cake
springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cakes should
start to shrink from the sides of the pans only after removal from
the oven.

Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 10 minutes. Loosen the
sides with a small metal spatula and invert onto greased wire racks.
To prevent splitting, reinvert so that the tops are up and cool
completely before wrapping airtight.
