Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a bowl combine 5 cups of flour,
mushroom dust, and set aside. Add yeast to 1/2 cup of the warm milk
along with 2 tablespoons of sugar, stir well until the yeast is
completely dissolved. Allow the yeast to proof for 5 minutes. In
another bowl place remaining milk, butter, and salt. Stir in flour
mixture, 1 cup at a time, using a wooden spoon. After the 3rd cup,
add yeast mixture. Continue stirring in the remaining flour until the
mixture is rather firm. Place the dough on a floured surface and
knead for 5 minutes, then place in an oiled bowl, and coat the dough
completely with oil. Allow to proof for 1 1/2 hours or until it
doubles in size.

Deflate the dough by punching it down 2 to 3 times, and knead for
about 4- 5 minutes. Divide the dough into two equal parts and shape
into round loaves. Place on a well buttered sheet tray, about 8
inches apart. Using a sharp knife, make 2 to 3 slits in the top of
the dough. Cover with a light towel and let rise again until doubled
in size. Bake for 35- 40 minutes or until a hollow sound is heard
when it is tapped on the bottom.
