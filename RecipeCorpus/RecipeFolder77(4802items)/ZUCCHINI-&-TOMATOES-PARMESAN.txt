Categories: D, D
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Zucchini
2 tb Chicken broth
2 md Tomatoes
1 tb Seasoned bread crumbs
1 tb Parmesan; grated
1/4 ts Basil
Preheat oven to 425F.  Trim zucchini with self-sharpening knife and
cut into 3/8-to-1/2 inch thick slices with Vario-slicer. Arrange in
the DDB. Season with salt and pepper and brush with chicken broth.
Bake 12 minutes, or until almost tender. Remove from oven but leave
oven on.

Place a slice of tomato on each zucchini slice. Combine bread crumbs
with cheese and basil in Batter Bowl. Return to oven and bake 5-6
minutes, until crumbs are lightly browned.

Note: Can be done in one step, but squash may not be soft when done.
Great for a show, if they are the Zucchini type. Posted by Sarah
