Title: TOASTED DRIED SEA LAVER - KEEM KUI *
Categories: Korean, Seafood, Condiment
Yield: 8 Servings
6    Sheets Dried Compressed
- Sea Laver
1 tb Sesame Oil
1/2 ts Salt
Tissue-thin sheets of dried and compressed sea laver (keem) are
toasted lightly until they turn bright green, then cut into small
pieces to serve as a side dish with main courses, rice or vegetables.

Throughout the waters surrounding Korea, Japan and Northern China,
this type of laver is harvested and processed to be put to many uses
in cooking; as a garnish, a vegetable, an edible food wrapper or as
part of a mixed condiment.

Brush the sea laver sheets on one side with the sesame oil, then
sprinkle lightly with salt.

Suspend over a gas flame or place under a hot broiler for about 8
seconds, until the laver turns bright green; do not let it burn or
catch fire.

Cool slightly, then cut into small squares and arrange on a serving
plate.
