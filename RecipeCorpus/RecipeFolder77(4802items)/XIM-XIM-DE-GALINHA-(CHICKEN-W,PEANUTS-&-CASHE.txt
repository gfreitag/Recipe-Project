Marinate the chicken in the lemon juice, salt, and pepper for half an
hour. Grind the dried shrimp in a food processor with the onion and
tomatoes into a thick paste. In a large saucepan, heat the oil over
medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until browned. Add
the onion, tomato, and shrimp paste and the drained chicken pieces.
Brown the chicken pieces on all sides, then add 1/4 cup of the water
bit by bit, cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 35 to
40 minutes, or until the chicken is almost cooked. Be sure that the
mixture does not boil and stir occasionally so that the chicken
pieces do not stick to the pan. Add the jumbo shrimp, malagueta
peppers, and ground nuts. Check the seasonings. Add the ginger and
remaining water and finish cooking by bringing the mixture to a boil.
When ready to serve, drizzle the dende over the xim-xim and cook for
a few more minutes. Serve hot with white rice and Farofa. ----
