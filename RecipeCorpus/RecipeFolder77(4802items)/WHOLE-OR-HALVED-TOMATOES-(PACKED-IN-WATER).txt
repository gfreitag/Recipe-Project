Title: WHOLE OR HALVED TOMATOES (PACKED IN WATER)
Categories: Vegetables, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 21 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 13 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 15 to 21 quarts-an average of 3
pounds per quart.

Procedure for hot or raw tomatoes filled with water in jars: Wash
tomatoes. Dip in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds or until skins
split; then dip in cold water. Slip off skins and remove cores. Leave
whole or halve. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid to jars (See
acidification directions). Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the
jars, if desired. For hot pack products, add enough water to cover
the tomatoes and boil them gently for 5 minutes. Fill jars with hot
tomatoes or with raw peeled tomatoes. Add the hot cooking liquid to
the hot pack, or hot water for raw pack to cover, leaving 1/2-inch
headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations
in Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3, depending on the method of canning
used.

Table 3. Recommended process time for Whole or Halved Tomatoes in a
weighted-gauge pressure canner.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Pints. Process Time: 15 min. Canner
Gauge Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
5    lb.
Above 1,000 ft:
10    lb.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Quarts. Process Time: 10 min. Canner

10    lb.
Above 1,000 ft:
15    lb. . NOTE: This section of the guide appears to contain
some sort of error in the information given within Table 3 above. In
the USDA book, there are only TWO sizes of jars specified in the
table, but there are THREE separate lines of figures in the table,
and it is not completely clear which jar size the second and third
entries refer to. I have given the second entry's numbers as those to
be used for Quart jars, and below I have reprinted the third entry on
the table, for an unknown jar size.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: ??. Process Time: 10 min. Canner Gauge
Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
15    lb.
Above 1,000 ft: Not Recommended.
