Categories: Desserts
Yield: 72 Pastries
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Butter; cut into 1" pieces
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2    Eggs
1 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
1/2 c  Orange juice
3 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Grated lemon peel
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  California dried figs
-- stems removed
1 c  Pitted dates
1 c  Walnuts
In food processor or mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar and cornstarch
for pastry.  Add butter and process (or mix) until dough holds
together. Divide into thirds. Roll out two-thirds of dough on a
baking sheet (13" x 17") to reach all corners evenly.  Prick with
fork. Bake in 350 F. oven for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, roll out
remaining dough between sheets of plastic wrap or waxed paper to a
rectangle about half the size (9" x 13") of baking sheet.  Cut into
long strips about 1/4 inch wide. Combine eggs, brown sugar, juices,
lemon peel and vanilla for filling in processor or mixer bowl.  Blend
well.  Add figs, dates and nuts to bowl (if using mixer, then finely
chop first).  Process until evenly minced. Spread filling over baked
pastry; top with strips of dough, crisscrossing diagonally. Return to
oven and bake for 30 minutes, until pastry strips are lightly
browned. Cool. Cut into small bars.
