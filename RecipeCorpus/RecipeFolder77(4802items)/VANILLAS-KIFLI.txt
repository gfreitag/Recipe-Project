Title: VANILLAS KIFLI
Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Hungarian
Yield: 30 Servings
3/4 c  Butter; unsalted, at room
-temperature
1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
2 ea Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Flour, all purpose
1/2 c  Vanilla sugar;*
2 oz Chocolate, semi sweet; 60 g
*Vanilla sugar is available in the baking section of most
supermarkets, in bulk food stores and baking supply stores. 1. Beat
butter with sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat in yolks and vanilla.
Gradually beat in flour. Turn out onto counter and knead as you would
bread until well combined. Form into a ball, cover with a bowl and
let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. 2. Preheat oven to 375F.
To form the crescents, roll about 1 Tbsp of the dough in the palms of
your hands. Then continue rolling to form a rope about 3 inches long
and 1/2 inch thick. Bend rope to form crescent. Repeat with remaining
dough, placing on ungreased cookie sheets about 1 inch apart. Bake on
centre sheet of preheated oven for about 10 to 12 minutes. Cookies
should be white in colour. To prevent breaking, cool on cookie sheets
for 5 minutes. Then, while cookies are still warm, carefully roll in
vanilla sugar. Repeat with remaining cookies. Cool cookies
completely. 3. Meanwhile, melt chocolate in a double boiler set over
simmering water. When cookies are cool, dip tips of each cookie in
melted chocolate, then set on waxed paper to dry.
