in the microwave until melted. Stir---> until smooth. Using a small
pastry brush; brush chocolate on the entire inside surface of the
fluted cup; being certain to get into each pleat.  Opt for a second
or third coat of chocolate if you aren't sure you got all places
covered. Put in the freezer to harden. Remove the cups, 1 at a time
and very carefully peel off the foil, trying to handle as gently as
possible. If the chocolate breaks and the foil is still intact, just
brush some more chocolate over the break and return to the freezer to
harden.
This sounds a lot more difficult than it actually is. Keep cups in
the freezer until you fill them with the---> mousse. WHITE CHOCOLATE
