Yield: 1 Servings    2 1/2 ts active dry yeast -- 1 1/4
oz envelope
:
1/4 c  sugar
1/4 c  warm water
3/4 c  skim milk
1/4 c  butter -- melted

1 TB chopped orange zest
1 ts salt
4    egg yolks -- lightly beaten
3 1/2 c  to 4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 c  sun-dried cranberries
1 c  chopped pecans

Butter a 10" tube pan and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine
the yeast, 1 tsp. of the sugar and the warm water. Set aside for 10
minutes. Combine the milk, butter, oil, zest, remainider of the sugar
and salt. Stir into the yeast mixture. Add the egg yolks, stirring
well. Add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each
addition to incorporate the flour thoroughly. Knead 5-10 minutes,
until the dough is smooth, elastic and satiny. Knead in the
cranberries and pecans. Put the dough back in the bowl,  cover the
bowl and let the dough rise at room temperature until it is doubled
in bulk. Using a wooden spoon, beat down the risen dough for about a
minute. Place the dough into the buttered tube pan and allow it to
rise at room temperature until it is doubled in bulk. Preheat the
oven to 375=B0. Bake the bread for 45-50 minutes or until it is dark
golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. Place on a rack to cool
or serve warm. Once cooled, the bread is also excellent sliced and
toasted.
