Yield: 8 Servings
3 md Bell pepper, green
4 ts Chiles serranos; finely
-chopped
1 tb Garlic; minced
1 1/2 tb Ginger, fresh; finely
-chopped
1/2 tb Turmeric
1/2 ts Cardamom, ground
2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper, white
1/4 c  Wine, dry, red or white
1/2 c  Butter or niter kebbeh
2 lb Sirloin, boneless
2 c  Onion; finely chopped
Coarsely chop *two* of the bell peppers.  Combine these with the next
eight ingredients (chiles through wine) in a blender. Process until
the mixture is a smooth pur#e.

Cut the remaining bell pepper into 2" x 1/2" strips. Set aside.

Trim meat of al fat and slice 1/2" thick.  Cut slices into strips 2"
long by 1/4" wide.

Heat 1/2 cup butter or niter kebbeh in a heavy 10" to 12" skillet,
until a drop of water dances.  Brown meat in the skillet, a little at
a time and turning often, until the meatz is browned evenly without
burning. Transfer meat to a plate as it is browned.  When all meat is
browned, pour remaining fat into a measuring cup. Add enough addi-
tional butter, or niter kebbeh, to measure 1/2 cup.  Set aside.

Wash and dry the skillet.  Add the onions and cook them over low heat
until soft and dry, about five minutes. Stir the onions continuously
to keep them from burning.  Pour in the 1/2 cup cooking fat.  When it
begins to sputter add the green pepper strips. Cook two to three
minutes, stirring continuously, until the pepper strips are soft. Add
the pureed green pepper mixture.  While stirring, heat to a boil. Add
beef strips and any liquid accumulated on the plate to the skillet.
Stir into the sauce to coat meat evenly.  Reduce the heat, partially
cover, and simmer until the meat is cooked to taste.
