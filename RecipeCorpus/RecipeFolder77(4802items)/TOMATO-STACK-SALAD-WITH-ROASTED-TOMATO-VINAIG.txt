Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Toss the Roma tomatoes with the
olive oil and season with Essence. Place the tomatoes, seed side
down, on a baking sheet and roast for about 8-10 minutes. Remove from
the oven and cool. Julienne the tomatoes. In a mixing bowl, whisk the
extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, basil and red onion
together. Add the julienned tomatoes. Season the vinaigrette with
salt and pepper. Season each side of the tomato slices with salt and
pepper. Season each side of the mozzarella slices with salt and
pepper. Toss the greens with 2/3 of the vinaigrette. Reserve the
remaining dressing. Alternate layering the tomatoes, cheese and
greens. Use 3 slices each of the tomatoes and cheese plus 1 cup of
the greens for each salad. Garnish each salad with the fried green
tomato, remaining vinaigrette, black pepper on the rim, parsley, and
edible flowers.
