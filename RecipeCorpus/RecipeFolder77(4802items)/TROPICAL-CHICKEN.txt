Title: TROPICAL CHICKEN
Categories: Low-cal, Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 lb Chicken; quartered parts
8 oz Pineapple; crushed  packed
1/2 c  Estee granulated fructose
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Dry mustard powder
The recipe, as POSTED (a rose by any other name....) was
published by Hidden Valley about 10 years ago, and I'm not sure that
the low fat version was available at the time. Since it is being
used, in this case, primarily as a seasoning, I see no reason why the
low fat would not work. As to the eggs, their main purpose is to hold
the seasoning to the chicken. Again, I think that the whites alone
would do the job. I also came across another chicken recipe that may
be of interest to you. Mix pineapple with its juice, fructose, lemon
juice and mustard in small bowl. Place chicken on rack in shallow
baking pan. Spread pineapple mixture over each piece of chicken
(approx 2 tablespoons each). Bake for 20 minutes, then remove from
oven to baste again. Bake 20 minutes and baste again. Return to oven
for final 20 minutes of baking. Pour pineapple sauce and drippings
from baking pan into bowl and chill. Skim fat, then return to sauce
pan to reheat. Serve sauce over chicken.
