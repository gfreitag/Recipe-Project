6 lb Small plums
1 3/4 c  Water
1    Box Sure-Jell
Suli Potter and Karen Frerichs of Berkeley and San Francisco,
respectively, are devotees of the wild plums that abound in Berkeley.
They have come up with lovely clear jelly made from the plums. The
flavor is just slightly tart, a nice change from too- sweet jellies.
Potter advises, "Follow the Sure-Jell instructions with mindless
fidelity. "

Leaving skins intact, cook plums in the water for 5 to 10 minutes.
Crush plums as they cook with the back of a wooden spoon. Squeeze
through a jelly bag and follow the Sure-Jell instructions. You will
have 6 3/4 CUPS juice.

Makes 7 or 8-1/2 pints.
