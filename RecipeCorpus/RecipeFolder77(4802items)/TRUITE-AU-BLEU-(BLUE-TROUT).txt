This dish is basically trout poached in a vegetable court bouillon
flavored with a cut-up trout.  It is a lovely way to offer the
delicacy of trout, and can be either a fish course, if the trout are
6-8 inchers, or a main course if the trout  are 10-11 inchers. As a
fish course for a game dinner serve    the trout cold ( in an aspic
if you wish-see below).

In a big saucepan or deep skillet with lid melt the butter and saute'
the vegetables until the shallot is just soft.
Add the single cut-up trout and the remaining ingredients (except
whole trout), bring to a bubble, and simmer for ten minutes or so.
Add the dressed whole trout, cover, and simmer slowly for about
20-minutes.
If the dish is a main course, remove the fish, drain, and serve
immediately with melted butter and lemon juice or herb butter.
If the dish is just a fish course, allow the fish to cool in the
liquor and serve the drained trout with a slice of lemon.
