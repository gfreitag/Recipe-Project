Categories: Light, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Flour
1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
4    Turkey breast cutlets -- 5
Oz
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Scallion -- thinly sliced
1 ts Garlic -- minced
1/3 c  Chicken broth
1/3 c  Marsala wine -- dry
1/2 ts Coarse salt
2 ts Fresh rosemary -- minced
OR 1/2 tsp. dried crumbled

On a piece of wax paper, combine flour and pepper. Lightly dredge each
cutlet in seasoned flour (dredge just before cooking or flour coating
will become gummy). In a 12-inch skillet, heat oil over medium low
heat. Add cutlets and saute until lightly golden, about 2 minutes on
each side. Transfer to platter. Add scallions to skillet, turn heat
to low, and cook, scraping any fragments left in bottom of pan with
wooden spoon, until barely tender, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and
saute for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and wine to skillet.  Turn heat
to medium and cook until liquid is reduced to half, about 3 minutes.
Season with salt and rosemary. Return cutlets and any accumulated
juices to skillet. Spoon sauce over cutlets, turn heat to low, and
simmer until heated, about 2 minutes. Transfer cutlets to platter.
Spoon sauce over cutlets, garnish with parsley, and serve.
