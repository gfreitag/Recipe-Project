Title: TOMATO & PANCETTA SAUCE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Tomatoes, peeled -- seeded
And chopped
3 tb Sun-dried tomatoes packed in
Oil -- finely chopped
2 tb Oil from sun-dried tomatoes
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 lb Pancetta or slab bacon --
Diced
1/4 c  Parsley -- finely chopped
Salt, if necessary
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine fresh tomatoes with
sun-dried tomatoes; set aside.

2. Pour oils into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish; place in the oven to
heat the oil, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add pancetta and return to the
oven until pancetta starts to brown, tossing occasionally with a
spatula, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes.

3. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are
cooked and form a sauce.

4. Remove from oven; stir in parsley. Season with salt, if necessary.

5. To serve: Cook 1 pound dried pasta, such as fusilli
(spiral-shaped) in salted water, following package directions. Drain.
Serve sauce over pasta and pass 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan
cheese at table.

* Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead, covered, and
refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into a freezer
container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 2 months. To
serve, defrost sauce 15 to 20 minutes in microwave oven on Defrost
setting, stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to 24
hours. Gently warm sauce in a saucepan or microwave oven on 50% power
until warmed through, about 3 minutes, whisking frequently and
vigorously to bring it to a creamy consistency.
