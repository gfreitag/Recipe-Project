Yield: 6 Servings

1/2    Lemon rind grated
50 g  Caster sugar
3    Egg whites
The House of Windsor is the correct name for the family our present
Queen Elizabeth II belongs to. This dish was created especially for
her and can now be enjoyed by all of you.

An exceptionally light pudding which is difficult to turn out of its
cooking dish.  For this reason I would always cook and serve it in
the same dish. Placing a small circle of greaseproof/cooking
parchment in the base of the dish can assist in its extraction.

You will also need a saucepan big enough to contain the pudding basin
or or souffle dish, with lid in place.

Grease a 1 litre pudding basin or souffle dish.  Place the rice in a
pan with the milk and cook until tender and all milk is absorbed.
Allow to cool a little.

Peel, core, and roughly chop the apples.  Stew until soft shaking the
pan from time to time in order that the apple does not stick. In the
meantime, half fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil.

Place apple and grated rind of 1/2 lemon in a blender and puree. Stir
in cooked rice and sugar.

Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry, bowl until they form fairly
stiff peaks.  Stir the egg into the apple mix. Spoon it all into the
prepared basin or dish. Cover with greasproof/parchment paper or
foil, and tie with string. Stand the basin/dish in the pan of boiling
water, after first placing an old plate in the base. The basin/dish
should stand on the plate, and the water should come about half way
up the basin/dish. Put on a tightly fitting lid and steam gently for
around 45 minutes. Serve hot! From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)
