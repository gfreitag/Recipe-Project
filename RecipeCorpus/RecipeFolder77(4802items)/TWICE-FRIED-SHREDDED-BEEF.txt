Categories: Chinese, Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Beef sirloin or flank steak
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
2 tb Dry sherry
2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Cornstarch
1 sm Carrot
1    Green bell pepper
2    Ribs celery
1 sm Onion
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 tb Rice vinegar
1 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Sesame oil
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Chili oil
1/2 ts Cornstarch
Preparation: Trim and discard fat from beef. Cut beef across the
grain into 1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces. Combine marinade ingredients
in a medium-size bowl. Add beef; stir to coat. Set aside for 30
minutes.

Cut carrot, bell pepper, and celery into 1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces.
Thinly slice onion.  Set vegetables aside separately.

Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

Cooking: Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2
inches. Place over high heat until oil reaches about 375 degrees F.
Add beef, half at a time, and deep fry for 1 minute until browned,
turning occasionally.  Lift out and drain on paper towels; set aside.
Cook remaining beef.

Remove all but 2 Tablespoons oil from wok.  Reheat oil over high heat
until hot.  Add carrot and onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 1
minute. Add bell pepper and celery; stir-fry for 1 more minute. Stir
in sauce and beef. Cook and toss until well mixed.

Tips: There should be just enough sauce to coat ingredients. It is
easier to slice beef thinly if it is partially frozen.
