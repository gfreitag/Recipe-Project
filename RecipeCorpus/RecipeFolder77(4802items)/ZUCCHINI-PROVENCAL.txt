Title: ZUCCHINI PROVENCAL
Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Salads, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Small zucchini; unpeeled
Salt
2    To 3 tb. olive oil
1 md Onion; peeled and chopped
1 lg Garlic clove; peeled
-- finely chopped
3 md Ripe tomatoes
-- peeled and quartered*
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 ts Chopped fresh thyme
1 ts Chopped fresh oregano
1/4 ts Fresh rosemary; fine chopped
2 tb Dry white wine
Salt and pepper; to taste
*Or use canned plum tomatoes.

Scrub zucchini well under running cold water.  Cut off ends and cut
into 1/4" slices.  Sprinkle with salt, toss to coat and let stand in
a colander for 30 minutes. Rinse well in cold water, then place in a
cloth towel and squeeze out bitter juices.  Dry well.

Heat half the oil in a large, heavy skillet and lightly saute
zucchini. Remove zucchini from pan and set aside. Discard used oil.
Add remaining oil; heat. Add onions and gently cook, covered, over
low heat ("sweat" the onions), just to soften.  Remove lid. Turn heat
to medium and add garlic. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes. Add
fresh herbs and wine and the reserved, sauteed zucchini.  Cook 5 to
10 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper.
Zucchini should still have some crunch to it.

To vary this, add sliced, seeded green or red peppers with the onions
to soften, and proceed as above.

Serve warm as a side dish or cold as a salad.  Use small zucchini for
the sweetest flavor.
