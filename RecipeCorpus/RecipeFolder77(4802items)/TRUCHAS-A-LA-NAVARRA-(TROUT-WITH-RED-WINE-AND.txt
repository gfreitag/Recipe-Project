Categories: Fish, Spanish
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Onions; finely chopped
1 tb Mint, fresh; finely cut
1/2 ts Rosemary, dried
1/2 ts Thyme, dried
1 sm Bay leaf; crumbled
15    Whole black peppercorns
-use up to 20
1 ts Salt
4    Trout;*
3    Egg yolks; lightly beaten
* 8 to 12 ounces each, cleaned but with heads and tails left on

In a flameproof glass, enamel or stainless-steel baking dish large
enough to hold the fish in one layer, combine the red wine, olive
oil, water, onions, mint, rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns and
salt, and stir thoroughly. Wash trout under cold running water and
dry them completely with paper towels. Then place them in the
marinade, turning them about to coat them thoroughly. Marinate at
room temperature for about 30 minutes, turning the trout over after
15    minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On top of the stove bring the
marinade to a simmer, then lay a sheet of wax paper or foil lightly
over the baking dish. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes,
or until the fish is firm to the touch. Be careful not to overcook.

With a slotted spatula, transfer the fish to a heated serving platter
and cover loosely with foil to keep them warm. Strain the cooking
liquid through a fine sieve into a small saucepan, pressing down hard
on the onions and herbs with the back of a spoon before discarding
them. Whisk about 1/4 cup of the liquid into the beaten egg yolks,
then whisk the mixture into the remaining liquid in the pan. Heat
slowly, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens lightly. (Do
not let it come anywhere near a boil or it will curdle.) Taste for
seasoning.

Pour the sauce over the trout or serve the sauce separately.
Traditionally the trout are accompanied by hot, freshly boiled
potatoes.
