Categories: Cheesecake, Chocolate, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
<--Cheesecake-->
1    1/2 c. sugar (up to 1)
1 1/2 lb (3 pkgs) softened cream
-cheese
3    Eggs
8    9 oz. good quality white
-chocolate
3 tb Heavy cream
1 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Amaretto
<--Topping-->
1 c  Sour cream
1 c  Confectioner's sugar
Use butter cookie or brown sugar cookie dough to make a crust. Or
make a cookie crumb crust.

Cheesecake: Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar.
Beat in eggs one at a time. Melt white chocolate with heavy cream (in
double boiler or in microwave, but if using microwave, stop and stir
every 20 seconds). Beat white chocolate, Amaretto, and sour cream
into batter. Beat a while longer. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven
55-60 minutes. If top starts to become too brown, cover w/ foil
part-way through baking. Or refrigerate cake and just slice top off
cheesecake when cool.

Topping: Whisk together. Add a touch of Amaretto or vanilla. Spoon
over top of cake, letting some drip over the sides.

Serve w/ fresh fruit, if desired.

Notes: (1) You'll probably want less than 1 1/2 cups of sugar since
the white chocolate & the Amaretto are both sweet. Add 1 cup, taste
batter, then add more if needed. (2) Suggested chocolates: Tobler
Narcisse, Lindt, Valhrona white chocolate couverture, Callebaut, etc.)
