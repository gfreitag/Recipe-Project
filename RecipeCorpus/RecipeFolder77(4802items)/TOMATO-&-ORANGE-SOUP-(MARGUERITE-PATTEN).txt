narrow strips of orange rind into cold water, bring to the boil and
simmer for 10 minutes then strain. Top the soup with the softened

liquid for about 20 minutes. Use DEFROST after the liquid comes to
boiling point.

Variations: Serve as an unthickened soup, simply sieve or liquidise
the ingredients add the orange juice and heat or serve well chilled.
Use 2 x 14 oz/400 g cans of chopped plum tomatoes instead of fresh.
