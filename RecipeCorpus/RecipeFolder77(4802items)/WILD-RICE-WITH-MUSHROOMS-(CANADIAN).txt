1 1/3 c  -Water; cold
1 ts Chicken bouillon
2    Bacon slice
1/2 c  Mushrooms; sliced
2 tb Green onion

Pour cold rice over rice in strainer and lift rice with fingers (to
remove any impurities). Combine rice and 1 1/3 cups water and
bouillon. Bring to a boil, reduce heat. Cover and simmer 60 minutes.*
Meanwhile cook bacon partially and add mushrooms, green onion and
thyme. Cook till bacon is crisp and mushrooms soft. Drain off fat.

parsley. Time consuming and expensive. Be prepared to give wild rice
as much cooking time as possible, occasionally it will require a bit
more time as it absorbs water more slowly than regular rice.
