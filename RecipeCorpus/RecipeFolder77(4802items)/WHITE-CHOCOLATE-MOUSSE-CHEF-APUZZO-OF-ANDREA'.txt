Categories: Puddings, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings

1 c  Heavy whipping cream
3    Eggs, separated
1/4 c  Brandy
1/4 c  Hot water
1 tb Vanilla
2 oz Sugar
White chocolate is not actually chocolate at all, but cocoa butter
with the chocolate liquor left out. This dessert was originally
concieved as a dark chocolate mousse by Chef Andrea Apuzzo of
Andrea's Restaurant in Metairie, Louisiana, when he was executive
chef at the Royal Orleans Hotel before opening Andrea's. It is served
piped into a chocolate cup, which is then placed in a pool of
raspberry sauce.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. It's a good idea
to stand over the chocolate while it is melting and stir it until it's
completely melted, then take it off the heat immediately.

Whip the cream and set aside. Pour the brandy and hot water slowly
into a bowl with the egg yolks, whisking briskly as you go until
completely mixed.

Whisk in the melted chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is
completely combined; this will help to cool the chocolate. Whip the
egg whites and the sugar until peaking but not dry; add the vanilla
to the egg whites and sugar as you beat them.

Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture carefully with
a wooden spoon.

Fold in the whipped cream. THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE
RECIPE. The key to a great chocolate mousse is that you can't
incorporate hot melted chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate
mixture must be cool to the touch or the cream will break. Lightly
blend the two mixtures until uniform.  Walt MM
