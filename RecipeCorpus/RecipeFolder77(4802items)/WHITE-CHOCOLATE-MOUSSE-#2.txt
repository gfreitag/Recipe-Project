Categories: Alcohol, Chocolate, Mousses

1/4 lb White chocolate -- pieces
4 tb Unsalted butter
3 tb Light rum
3    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Cream
3    Egg whites
SAUCE-----
4 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Milk

1/2 lb Semi-sweet chocolate
TO MAKE THE MOUSSE, place white chocolate pieces in a large bowl with
butter and rum. Place the bowl in a very low oven with the door ajar.
The chocolate should take about 45 minutes to melt. This must be done
slowly. Meanwhile, beat egg yolks in a large bowl of an electric
mixer until light and thick. Transfer to top of double boiler. Cook,
stirring, over hot water until thick. Return to mixer bowl. When
chocolate is melted, stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Slowly
beat in egg yolks. Beat cream until stiff. Fold into chocolate
mixture. Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold into mixture. Pour into a
lightly oiled 8-inch spring form pan. Refrigerate overnight.

To serve, cut into pieces and place on cold plates. Drizzle a small
amount of warm chocolate sauce over the top of each wedge and place a
"puddle" on either side.

CHOCOLATE SAUCE:  Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler. Stir in
unsalted butter, stir in milk and heavy cream, both at room
temperature. Keep warm.
