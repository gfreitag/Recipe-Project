Categories: Wildgame
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Deer neck and shank
24    Pearl onions
1 1/2    Onion, chopped
1 lb Fresh mushrooms, chopped
1 tb Tomato sauce
3 tb Wine, sherry or port

Cut meat from bones into chunks about 3/4". Heat 1/4 stick of butter
in a large steel or aluminum pot. Add 1 tsp olive oil to retard
burning. Brown deer chunks until well-seared, then add sherry or port
and cook for 10 minutes more. Remove from pot and set aside. To the
liquid remaining in the pan add pearl or chopped onion and brown
until golden. Add tomato paste, stirring in well. Add flour and stir
into mixture. Return deer to pot, adding stock. Add 1/3 the red wine,
bring to a boil, then simmer for 3 hours or until tender, adding wine
by 1/3 until used up. Add mushrooms 30 minutes before serving. Serve
over buttered noodles or rice.

Suggestions: Leave out mushrooms and substitute chopped carrots at
start.
