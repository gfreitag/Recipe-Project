Title: ZUCCHINI PIZZA
Categories: Italian, Pizza
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Zucchini
1 ts Salt
3 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan
1/2 ts Oregano
Pepper
Olive oil
1 c  Tomato sauce
Pizza toppings: mushrooms, Mozzarella, etc.

Grate zucchini and sprinkle with salt.  Let stand for 30 minutes.
Squeeze out water from zucchini.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 pan.

Combine zucchini, eggs, flour, Parmesan cheese, oregano and a few
grinds of pepper. Spread mixture onto pan. Bake 25-30 minutes or
until firm and dry. Brush with oil and broil until lightly browned.
Spread with tomato sauce. Add mushrooms and Mozzarella cheese on top.
Broil again until Mozzarella is melted and bubbly.

Notes:  Can also be made in a jelly roll pan I prefer just mushrooms
on top, too many extras don't enhance IMHO You could probably use a
mixture of Romano and Parmesean...
