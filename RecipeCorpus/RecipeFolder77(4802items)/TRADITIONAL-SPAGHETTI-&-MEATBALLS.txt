Put the bread into a medium mixing bowl and pour the milk over it.
Let sit 5 minutes. Add the egg whites, ground turkey, ground beef,
Romano cheese, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Knead the mixture

hands into cool water before forming each meatball. Form mixture into
30 1 1/2-inch balls.

Pour the tomato sauce into a large, heavy-bottom saucepan and bring
to a simmer over low heat. Warm 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large
non-stick skillet. Add half the meatballs to the skillet and brown
them on all sides. Spoon the meatballs into the tomato sauce. Add the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil to the skillet and brown the
rest fo the meatballs, then add them to the sauce. Simmer, stirring,
for 20 minutes.

While sauce is simmering, prepare pasta according to package
directions; drain. Transfer to a large serving bowl. Remove bay
leaves from sauce; pour sauce over pasta and serve.
