A mixture of several kinds of fresh herbs is preferable, such as
thyme, basil, oregano and/or tarragon. 1. Heat the broiler. Place a
10-inch skillet over high heat. when it is hot, add oil. Heat briefly
then add zucchini, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,
until zucchini begins to soften, about 3 minutes. 2. Reduce the heat
to medium-low; add the eggs, green onions and herbs. Cook gently,
using a fork to lift the cooked portions from the sides of the pan so
the uncooked centre flows underneath. Cook until the frittata is
almost set, 4 to 5 minutes. Scatter the mozzarella over. 3. Transfer
pan to the heated broiler. Broil just until the top is lightly
browned and set, 30 to 45 seconds. Brush with the vinegar and
sprinkle Parmesan over. Serve hot or at room temperature.
