squash & broccoli & continue to stir-fry until the vegetables are
tender-crisp.  Drain the tomatoes & add them.  Reduce the heat & cook
for 5 to 10 minutes.  The liquid should be reduced but not evaporated.

Wrap tortillas in tin foil & place in oven to warm. Wrap filling
inside tortillas & serve.

MARK'S NOTE: Use whatever vegetables you can get.  I replace the
squash with zucchini & often use cauliflower in place of broccoli.
