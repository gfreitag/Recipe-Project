Title: YELLOW HELL HABANERO PASTE BY BALOO
Categories: Yellow hab, Spice paste, Baloo
Yield: 1 Liter
750 g  Yellow Habanero (fresh)
15 cl Thyme (fresh) - chopped
1 dl Sage leaves(fresh)-chopped
1 dl Lime juice
1 dl Apple cider Vinegar
3 tb Coriander seeds - ground
2 tb Salt
1 tb Liquid Smoke
Remove the stems and the seeds from the habanero. DON'T REMOVE THE
VEINS!

Put all ingredients in a food processor, using the steel blade, and
mix 10 minutes until you have a smooth paste.

This sauce is best when used fresh, but if you want to make enough to
keep for some weeks or months you can boil it and put in sterilised
jars.

This makes a fruity but EXTREMELY HOT chile sauce. Be careful.

~---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wash your hands with 80% alcohol after you handled the habaneros!
Don't touch your eyes or your private parts before you have washed
your hands with alcohol! It will burn for hours.
