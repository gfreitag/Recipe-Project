Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
3 c  Bread cubes
3 c  Milk
8 lg Eggs -- beaten
6 1/4 lb Ground veal
1 1/4 lb Ground lean pork
4 oz Processed cheddar cheese --

This loaf should be baked before freezing.  Preheat oven to 375B0 F.
(moderate).

Soak bread cubes in milk.  Stir in eggs.  Mix remaining ingredients
thoroughly with milk mixture. Divide mixture into fourths. Press each
fourth into an 8x8x2-inch baking pan. Bake 1 hour or until loaf is
done.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Serve immediately after removing from
oven.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Remove from pans
and place on freezer wrap.  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top.
Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of
wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 2 months). Freeze
immediately for 10 to 12 hours before stacking packages.

TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Heat 1 hour or until center
is hot.
