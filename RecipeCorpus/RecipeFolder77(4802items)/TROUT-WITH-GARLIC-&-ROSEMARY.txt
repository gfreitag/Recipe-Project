A simple approach that doesn't complicate the delicate flavors of
trout, this recipe yields a delicious and attractive entree with a
minimum of preparation.

Rinse the trout inside and out; pat dry with paper towel. Using your
fingers, rub olive oil over the inside and outside surface of each
fish. Next, gently rub one clove of crushed garlic inside the body
cavity of each trout, distributing the garlic throughout. Place one
sprig of rosemary inside each fish.  Place fish over medium-hot fire
and grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve with lemon wedges.
