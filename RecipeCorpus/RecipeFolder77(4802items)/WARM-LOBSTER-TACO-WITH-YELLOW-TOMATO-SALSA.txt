To make Yellow Tomato Salsa, in a food processor, using steel blade,
process tomatoes until well chopped. Don't puree. Combine tomatoes and
their juices with shallot, garlic, cilantro, vinegar, chilies, lime
juice, salt, and mix well. Add maple syrup, if needed, to balance
flavor and slightly sweeten. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2
hours or until very cold.

To make taco, fill large stock pot with lightly salted water and
bring to a boil over high heat.  Add lobsters and cook for about 8
minutes or until just done. Drain and let lobsters cool slightly.
Remove meat from lobster tails, careful not to tear it apart. Cut
meat into thin medallions (or medium size dice, if meat breaks
apart). Heat oil in medium saute pan, over medium heat and saute
lobster medallions until just heated through. Spoon equal portions
warm lobster medallions into center of each warm flour tortilla.
Sprinkle each with equal portions of grated cheese and shredded
spinach.  Roll into cylinder shape and place each one on warm serving
plate with the edge facing bottom. Surround the taco with Yellow
Tomato Salsa.
