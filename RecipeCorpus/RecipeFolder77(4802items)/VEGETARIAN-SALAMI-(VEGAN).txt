Title: VEGETARIAN SALAMI (VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Dec., Vegetarian
Yield: 24 Servings
1 lb Firm Chinese-style tofu
1 qt Water
Tempeh marinade (see
Recipe)
1    Garlic clove, thinly sliced
1/8 ts Ground black pepper
1. Drain the tofu and slice it into four equal pieces. Place the tofu
and water in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook for 7 minutes.
Drain and cut into slices about 1/8 inch thick. Lay slices in one
layer on a clean, thick kitchen towel. Cover with another thick
kitchen towel and lay some heavy books on top to press out the water.
Let stand for 30 minutes.

2.  Prepare the Tofu Marinade and add the garlic and black pepper to
it at the end. Pour a little marinade into a flat-bottomed container
that has a lid that seals and lay one layer of tofu in it. Cover with
marinade and add another layer of tofu. Repeat until all the tofu and
marinade are used up. Refrigerate for two days. If the marinade does
not cover the tofu, turn container upside-down for half the time. The
tofu can remain in the marinade for up to four days. The longer it
soaks, the stronger it will be. If you prefer the slices to be drier,
remove them from the marinade and lay them in one layer on a dish in
the refrigerator for several hours. After the tofu has been removed
from the marinade, store it wrapped or covered in the refrigerator
for up to two days, or wrap tightly and freeze.

3. Use in sandwiches as you would use cold cuts, or cut up in salads.

Makes 1 pound, or 24 slices.
