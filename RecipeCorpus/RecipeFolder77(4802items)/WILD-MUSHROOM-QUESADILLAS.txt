The contrasting flavors and textures of warm, cheese-filled corn

minutes. Season with salt to taste and set aside.

Heat 1 tortilla on a pan to soften, then place an eighth of the sliced
cheese on one half, fold over and continue to heat, turning, until
cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining tortillas and cheese.

Open cheese-filled tortillas and fill each with a few spoonfuls of
sauteed mushrooms and a spoonful of salsa. Serve immediately.
