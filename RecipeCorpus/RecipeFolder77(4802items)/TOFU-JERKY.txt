Title: TOFU JERKY
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Soy sauce
3 tb To 4 tb liquid smoke
1/8 c  Water
1 tb Onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder or
1    Clove crushed fresh garlic
1 tb Fresh ground black pepper
1 ts Honey
1 lb Firm or extra firm tofu
Cut and drain the tofu.  I usually take a 1 lb cube, cut it in
half,and then slice it into strips on its short side. Strips should
be about 4-5 mm in thickness. They may look big, but they'll shrink
to about half their size.

Mix all the marinade ingredients together well. Put the tofu in a
single layer in a shallow baking pan or cookie sheet and pour the
marinade over it.  Let soak for several hours or overnight.

Drain excess liquid (and reuse!) and dry tofu in food dehydrator or
warm (200 F) oven.  This will take probably 4-8 hours, depending on
weather. If you live in a sunny, dry climate (Colorado in the
summer), you can sun dry it, it'll take all day.

If you dry indoors in the winter, your house gets filled with a
wonderful smoky smell. If you're drying in the oven, you'll need to
flip the tofu over hourly so it dries evenly. The stuff is delicious
and keeps indefinitely.  Dry the stuff until it's very chewy, but not
crispy.

Be creative: Use low-sodium soy if you want less salt (it is rather
salty) Use tabasco or ground cayenne if you want it hot. Chili powder
makes chili jerky. Oregano and basil makes pizza jerky. From:
