Title: TYROSPAMITES
Categories: Spam, Cheese, Feta, Dill, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Spam
1 pk Frozen phillo dough
4 oz Feta cheese
1    Clove Garlic, minced
1 tb Snipped fresh dill
Butter flavored cooking
Spray
Follow the directions on the box for the pastry, ( defrosting,
handling, baking time and temperature) Cut the slab of Spam in half.
Cut those pieces diagonally so you have a triangular cross-section
then slice the Spam into 1/4 inch thick triangles. In a small bowl,
crumble the cheese, add the garlic and dill and mix well. Cut the
dough into 3 to 4 inch wide strips. Follow the directions on the box,
this dough is tricky to handle. You will use 2 strips for each
pastry. Spray the butter-flavored oil between each layer. Place a
triangle of Spam at the end of the doubled, sprayed strip and top
with 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixture. Fold the filing into the
dough, side to side, (like you learned to fold the American flag in
Scouts) until you have a triangular pastry with several layers
enclosing the Spam filling.  Spray (or brush) with butter. Bake until
golden. (follow package

directions)  These can be frozen before baking and cooked without
defrosting a few at a time as you need them.
