* The Latin name for pansies is Viola x wittrockiana, only use in
amount specified "This colourful starter makes a great supper or
lunch dish served with new green peas or a leafy salad. Its bright
colours make it appealing to both adults and children and it easy to
make." First make the flan case; sift the flour and salt into a large
bowl and tip in the bran remaining in the sieve. Chop the margarine
into the flour with a knife, then gently rub in with your fingertips
until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Lift your fingers above
the bowl as you rub to keep the mixture light or aerated (Anne's
note: I would use a food processor). Add the iced water and mix with
a knife until you have a firm dough. Lift out the dough, wrap in
cling film (Saran) and chill in the fridge for 5-10 minutes. Heat the
oven to 350F/180 C/gas 4. On a lightly floured marble or wooden
surface, roll out the dough thinly into a circle large enough to line
a 8-0/20-24 cm flan dish. Grease the dish and line it with the dough.
Set aside. To make the filling, heat the butter and oil in a shallow
pan, put in the onions and peppers and sweat (cook) gently until the
vegetables are soft but not coloured. Add the pansies. Whisk the eggs
and stir in the grated cheese and milk. Season to taste. Pour the
onion and pepper mixture into the egg mixture and stir well. Pour
into the prepared flan case. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes.,
rising the heat a little if necessary, until the filling is nicely
puffed up and the pastry is beginning to brown. Serve hot or cold.
