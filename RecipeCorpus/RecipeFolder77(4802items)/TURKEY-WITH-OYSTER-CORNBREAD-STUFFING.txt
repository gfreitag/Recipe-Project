8 c  Crumbled cornbread/muffins
5    Scallions; washed & minced
-(include tops)
10 md Mushrooms; wiped and chopped
1 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
18    Oysters; drained and chopped

Turkey giblets
- cooked and chopped
1    Egg
1    Garlic clove
- peeled and crushed
2 tb Minced parsley
1/2 ts Powdered savory
1/4 ts Fresh ground pepper
2 1/2 ts Salt
5 tb Oyster liquid
5 tb Giblet-cooking water
1/4 c  Melted butter or margarine
Wipe turkey well with a damp cloth, inside and out. Remove any
pinfeathers, and singe off hairs. Simmer the giblets in 1 1/2 c water
for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from cooking water, and chop. Save the
cooking water. Mix the dressing ingredients together thoroughly, and
stuff both neck and body cavities of the bird. Wrap remaining
stuffing in aluminum foil. Skewer the openings shut, truss, and place
the turkey breast down on a poultry rack in a large roasting pan.
Place the foil-wrapped stuffing in the bottom of the pan. Rub the
bird generously with about 1/4 cup of the softened butter. Roast the
turkey, uncovered, in a moderately slow oven, 325 degrees, basting
every 20 minutes with a mixture of the oyster liquid, giblet-cooking
water, and remaining butter, melted. After 1 1/2 hours or roasting,
turn the turkey breast side up. Allow about 30 minutes per pound for
roasting the turkey. The turkey is done when the leg joint moves
easily. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
