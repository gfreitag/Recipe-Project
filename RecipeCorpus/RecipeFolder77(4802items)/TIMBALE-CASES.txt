Title: TIMBALE CASES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Flour
1    Egg
1/2 ts Cooking oil
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
Combine slightly beaten egg, milk, sugar, salt, and cooking oil. Sift
flour slowly into the mixture, beating constantly until smooth. Set
aside for 1 hour or until free from bubbles. Fry on a timbale-iron
which has been heated by immersing in deep, hot fat (360 F). Dip
heated iron into batter. Hold iron at an angle until the bottom is
covered, then lower iron into batter until 1/2 inch from top. Hold
iron straight and lower into hot fat (360 F).  Cook until case is
crisp and brown. Remove from fat; slip case from iron.  Drain on
crumpled, absorbent paper. If batter slips from iron back into bowl
the iron is not hot enough. If case slips from iron into fat, the fat
is too hot. The Household Searchlight - 1941
