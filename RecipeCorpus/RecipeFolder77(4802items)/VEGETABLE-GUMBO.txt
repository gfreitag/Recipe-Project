Title: VEGETABLE GUMBO
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Onion, chopped
1/2    Green pepper, diced
2    Ribs Celery, diced
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 lb Okra, sliced, fresh, frozen
1 lb Tomatoes, fresh, or canned
2 c  Corn, fresh, frozen, canned
1 ts Vegetable Bouillon granules
1/2 c  White Grape Juice
1/2 c  Water
1/4 ts Tabasco sauce
1/4 ts Paprika
2 tb Fresh chopped parsley
1 tb Basil or Rosemary, minced
Vegetable coating spray
Method: In a large heavy stew pot, place bouillon and 1/2 C white
grape juice, onion, green pepper, celery garlic, cook until tender,
5-7 minutes. Add other ingredients, cook over low heat, stirring
occasionally to keep from sticking to bottom. Cover and simmer gently
until corn and okra are done. (or simmer in crockpot 6-7 hours) Note:
Cut fresh corn from cob with a sharp knife, then scrape the remaining
corn off the cob. Four ears will make about two cups. If you use
dried herbs, rub them with the palms of your hands before adding to
the pot, this releases their aroma and goodness. Exchanges: 1 Veg, 1
