Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE BAVAROIS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Egg
1 tb Sugar
1/4 l  Whipping cream
2    Sheets of gelatine
1 tb White rum
150 g  White chocolate
5 tb Milk
Break chocolate into pieces and put in a bowl and add the milk. Heat
it 'au bain marie'(*) and stir occasionally until chocolate has
melted. Even better: put the bowl in the microwave, heat for 2 times
2 minutes on low and stir well. Make sure the chocolate doesn't get
too hot, because it will get lumpy (gritty) and useless. Let the
melted chocolate cool down to room temperature, by putting it in a
larger bowl with cold water.

Put egg & sugar in a large bowl. Mix with an electric mixer until
white and creamy (about 8 minutes).

Soak the gelatine leaves in lots of cold water for about 5 minutes or
until soft.

Heat two tablespoons of water in a bowl / small pan until cooking.
Remove from heat and solve the wrung-out gelatine in it. Let it cool
a little.

Put the rum, the melted chocolate and the solved gelatine into the
bowl with the egg mixture. Fold together carefully with a large spoon
(or two).

Put the mixture in the fridge and let it set just a little or until
you finished the next task...being:

Whip the cream until stiff.

Carefully fold the cream into the rest of the pudding. Put it in small
bowls or one large bowl.

Serve with chocolate sauce (i just buy a bottle).

(*) au bain marie =
put the bowl in a larger pan with water. Heat the water and wait
until 	the stuff in the bowl is heated.
