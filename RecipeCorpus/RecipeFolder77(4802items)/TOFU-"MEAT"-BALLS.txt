Title: TOFU "MEAT" BALLS
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
6 c  ;water; boiling (or more)
5 c  Tofu; crumbled
1 c  Whole grain bread crumbs
1/4 c  Tamari
1/4 c  Nutritional yeast
1/4 c  Peanut butter
Egg replacer for 1 egg
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
4    Garlic cloves; pressed
1 ts Thyme
1 ts Basil
1/4 ts Celery seed
1/4 ts Cloves; ground
Drop all but 1 cup of the crumbled tofu into the boiling water.
Bring the water back to a boil and cook for 1 minute.

Drain the tofu into a colander lined wiht a clean dishtowel. Run cold
water over the hot tofu to cool it off for easier handling.

Twist the dishtowel and press the tofu to squeeze out the excess
water. The pressed tofu should have a firm, ground-beef-like texture.

Put the pressed tofu in a bowl and add the remaining ingredients to
the pressed tofu and mix well (use your hands for mixing). Shape th
emixture into walnut-sized balls and place them on a well-oiled
cookie sheet.

Bake at 350 deg for 20-25 minutes or until the balls are firm and
brown. Turn them over once during the baking if necessary.

Serve tofu "meat" balls with your favorite tomato sauce and whole
wheat spaghetti. Tofu "meat" balls freeze very well, so make more
than you need. They may be reheated by dropping them into a simmering
sauce or stew.
