This easy-to-make soup gives a whole new, flavorful meaning to the
term 'broth'.  It can be served hot or cold.

Peel tomatoes by dropping them into boiling water for 1 minute. Under
cool water, slip off peels.  Coarsely chop and place in a 4 quart
saucepan with remaining ingredients except the chicken broth. Simmer
uncovered, over medium heat for 25 minutes.

Remove bay leaf and transfer soup to a blender or food processor.
Puree for 30 seconds.  Set up a food mill or colander over the
original saucepan, and press the pureed soup through the mill into
the pan. Add the broth; simmer until ready to serve.  Garnish with
snow peas.

Yield: 4 servings.
