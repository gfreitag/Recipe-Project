Recipe by: McDougall Place beans in pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring
to boil, remove from heat and let rest 1 hour. Then add chopped
onion, garlic, and simmer for
1 1/2    hours.

Chop potatoes in large chunks; do not peel. Slice carrots 1/2 inch and
zucchini 1 inch thick, scrub them, do not peel. Slice leeks and cut
beans into 1 inch pieces. Add to soup pot along with seasonings.
Simmer for 1 hour longer.

Thinly slice cabbage and add to soup along with rice or spaghetti.
Simmer another 20 minutes. Add more water if too thick. Add tomato
wedges for the last 10 minutes, just before serving.

HELPFUL HINTS: Kidney beans make a good rich broth, but any kind of
bean also may be used. Soup freezes well, so make a large batch when
you have time and freeze half for use on a budy day. Try using some
chopped spinach, instead of the cabbage. By changing the vegetables
and beans used, the soup can be different each time you make it. It
is a meal in itself. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,
