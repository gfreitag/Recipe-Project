Title: TUNA BRAISED WITH CRANBERRIES~ PORT~ & CREAM
Categories: Faylen, Seafood
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Tuna steaks, 6-8 oz each,
" thick
-flour to dust the tuna
3 tb Butter
1/2 c  Port
2 tb Finely minced shallots
1/4 c  Whole cranberry sauce
2 tb Demi-glaze or brown sauce
-(see Note.)
-zest from 1 orange, finely
-julienned
1/4 c  Cream
-Dust tuna steaks lightly
-with flour.
-Melt 1/2 the butter over
-medium-high heat.
Pan-fry the tuna for 1 minutes each side or until brown. Remove the
fish and increase the heat to high. Deglaze the pan by pouring in the
port. Add the shallots, cranberry sauce, demiglaze and orange zest
and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to simmer and add cream. Return
the tuna steaks to braise for 4 minutes. Remove the tuna to dinner
plates and continue to reduce the sauce for an additional 2-3
minutes. Swirl in the remaining butter and pour the sauce over the
tuna. Serves 2. Note: Demi-glaze is a refinement on the brown sauce
used by professional chefs. It is available in the gourmet section of
some supermarkets. A quality brown or espagnole sauce, homemade or
commercial, may be substituted. My note: According to Larousse
Gastronomique, demi-glaze, espagnole sauce, and brown sauce require a
lot of work. If you're not a gourmet cook, I'd say it would be
reasonable to substitute a good-quality beef stock (not bouillon!)
Chicken stock, if you prefer, would probably work. Just make sure
it's a low-salt. It looks like the thing these sauces have in common
is the strong taste of the meat they were made from, and little of
anything else.
