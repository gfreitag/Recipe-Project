Title: WEEKEND TAGLIATELLE
Categories: Vegan, Pasta
Yield: 2 Servings
2 lg Garlic cloves; crushed
2 tb Olive oil
175 g  Fresh tagliatelle
-- cooked 'al dente'
40 g  Pine nuts; lightly browned
Freshly ground black pepper
You have to eat this at the weekend simply because it is so incredibly
garlicky as to be anti-social to anyone who has not eaten it! For all
its simplicity, it is among the most delicious of pasta dishes.

Stir the crushed garlic into the olive oil and add masses of freshly
ground black pepper. Mix into the hot, drained tagliatelle and toss
thoroughly. Finally mix in the pine nuts, give it all another toss
and serve immediately with a crisp green salad.
