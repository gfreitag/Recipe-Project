Flatten the cutlets between two pieces of plastic wrap. In a heavy
skillet, cook 1/2 cup of the onion and mushrooms in 6 Tbsp butter
over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is golden.
Stir in bread crumbs, basil, salt and pepper to taste.  Let the
filling cool. Divide the filling among the cutlets and fold in the
long sides of each cutlet 1/2-inch. Roll up the cutlets and tie them
at each end. In a large heavy skillet, heat 2 Tbsp butter over
mod-high heat. Brown the veal birds, patted dry, and transfer them to
a bowl as they are browned. In the skillet, cook the remaining onions
in 1 Tbsp butter over moderate heat, stirring, until golden.  Stir in
stock, tomato puree, and the paprika. Add the veal birds and any
accumulation of juices. Simmer the mixture, covered, for 15-20
minutes or until the veal is tender. Arrange the noodles on a
platter, remove strings from the veal, and transfer the veal birds to
the platter. Whisk the sour cream with salt and pepper to taste into
the skillet contents. Cook sauce until it is hot, stirring
occasionally. Do not let it boil. Serve alongside the meat and
noodles in a boat. a 1959 Gourmet Mag. favorite
