Categories: Pickles, Mom
Yield: 1 Batch
1 ga Watermelon rind, prepared
4 tb Lime (slaked)
Water
10 c  Sugar, granulated (divided)
8 c  Apple cider vinegar (divide)
Cheesecloth
2 tb Cloves, whole
2 tb Allspice, whole
4    Cinnamon sticks
Ginger root (2 pieces)
Peel watermelon, removing all green and pink flesh; cut rind into
cubes and measure a gallon.  Heat a large pot of boiling water; drop
rind in and boil for
5    minutes.  Drain and cool.

Dissolve slaked lime in 2 quarts cold water.  Pour over rind; let
stand for 4 hours.  Drain and rinse thoroughly. Cover rind with cold
water and bring to boil; boil till rind is tender and drain.

Combine 4 1/2 cups sugar, 2 cups vinegar and 8 cups water. Add
allspice, cloves, cinnamon and ginger root (all tied in a cheesecloth
bag). Bring to boil; boil for 5 minutes. Add rind and return to boil.
Lower heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Leave rind standing in syrup
in cool place between 12 and 24 hours.

Add 6 cups vinegar and 6 to 8 cups sugar (to taste); bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer until rind is transparent and syrup is almost
as thick as honey.  If syrup gets too thick before rind becomes
transparent, add 1/2 cup hot water, a little at a time, as needed.

Discard bag.  Pack boiling rind and syrup into hot jars and seal.
Store at least a month before serving.
