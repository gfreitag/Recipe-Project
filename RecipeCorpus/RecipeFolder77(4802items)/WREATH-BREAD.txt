and knead until smooth, continuing to add fourth flour (4). Knead at
least 15 minutes.

Place in lightly oiled bowl, turning dough so top is oiled too. Let

3 equal parts.  Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Lightly oil two cookie
sheets.

On floured work surface, roll each piece into a 24" length. Place

and pinch together. Repeat with each loaf. Cover rings with towels

golden brown and bread makes thunking sound when tapped with knuckle.
