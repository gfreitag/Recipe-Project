Title: YOGURT
Categories: Dairy
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 1/2 c  Canned milk
2 2/3 c  Skim milk
1 ts Unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Commercial yogurt (or 1 pkg.
Yogurt starter)
Put the milk in a 2 quart pan and sprinkle on gelatin. Let soak 5
minutes or so then stir with a wire whisk while heating to almost
boiling (to pasteurize).  Cool to warm. Add 1/4 cup commercial yogurt
(unflavored) and whisk in until incorporated.  rinse out small hars
with hot water and fill with warm yogurt mixture  (1/2 pint canning
jars work well for this and are approximately the size of serving
size you get in the store). Set in a warm place overnight, covered
with a blanket.

I have read that you can incubate the yogurt by pouring the yogurt
mix into a warmed thermos bottle and letting it sit overnight.
Personally, I use the Salton Yogurt maker that I found at the
Salvation Army for $2.00; it works every time.
