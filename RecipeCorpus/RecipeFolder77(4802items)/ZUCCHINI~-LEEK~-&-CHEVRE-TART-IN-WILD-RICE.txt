A zucchini quiche but the crust is made with a crunchy wild rice; try
Wehani. It's a satisfying counterpoint to the creamy French custard
filling.  Allow time to cook and cool the rice. Preheat an oven to
350F. [PATh 12 Oc 96 Mc-Recipe]

To make the crust, beat the egg, cheese, lemon juice, and melted
butter together in a howl. Stir in the cooked rice, season to taste
with salt and pepper, transfer to a 9-inch piepan, and press with
your fingertips to cover bottom and sides evenly . Bake until set and
crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room
temperature, about 30 minutes. (Or cover and refrigerate as long as
overnight; return to room temperature before filling.)

Meanwhile, make the filling. Place the squash in a colander set over
a bowl or in a sink. Generously sprinkle with salt, mix with your
fingertips to distribute the salt, and let stand for 30 minutes.
Gather squash in your hand and gently squeeze to release any
additional surface moisture. Reserve.

Heat the butter in a saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat, add
the leek, and saute until soft, about 5 minutes Add the drained
squash and saute about
5    minutes longer; reserve.

In a bowl, combine the eggs, cream, mustard, cheese, marjoram, and
salt and pepper to taste and whisk to blend well. Stir in the leek
and squash mixture, pour into the rice shell,and bake in the 350F
oven until filling is set and the top is golden, about 30 to 35
minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature. Recipe By
