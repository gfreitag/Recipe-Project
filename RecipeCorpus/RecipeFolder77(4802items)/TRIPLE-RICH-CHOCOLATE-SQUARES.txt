Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Pan
14    Chocolate sandwich cookies
2 pk (8oz each) cream cheese,
Softened
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Chocolate drink powder
2 tb All-purpose flour
3    Large eggs, at room temp.
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 ts Solid vegetable shortening
Heat oven to 350F; line a 9-inch baking pan with foil, leaving 2-inch
overhangs.

In a food processor or blender process cookies to fine crumbs; you
should have about 1 1/2 cups. Transfer crumbs to baking pan; press
firmly over bottom. Set aside.

In a large bowl with electric mixer at high speed, beat cream cheese,
sugar, drink powder, flour, eggs, and vanilla until just blended and
smooth. Pour over crust in pan; bake 25 minutes until set but still
soft in center. Cool completely, in pan, on wire rack; refrigerate,
covered, at least 3 hours or overnight.

At serving time, in a small microwave bowl combine chocolate chips and
shortening; melt on high (100% power) 1 to 2 minutes. Dip tip of small
spoon into chocolate; let drizzle in random pattern over surface of
chilled square.

Using foil overhangs as handles, lift square from pan. Peel foil away
from sides of square; cut into 2-inch squares.
