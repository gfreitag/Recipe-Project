Make the apricot compote: In a medium saucepan, combine the apricots,
water, sugar and orange liqueur. Cook the mixture over medium heat,
stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves . Bring the mixture
to a boil; reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the mixture for 5
minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool for 15
minutes. Remove 12 whole apricots from the compote and set them aside
for garnish. Pour the remaining compote into the bowl of a food
processor fitted with the metal blade. Process the mixture for 30 to
45 seconds, until smooth. Transfer the purie to a small bowl, cover
and refrigerate until ready to use.

Make the ginger-sesame tuiles: In a small bowl place the flour, sesame
seeds and ginger. Using a whisk, gently stir the dry mixture until
combined.

In a medium saucepan combine the butter, sugar and honey. Cook the
mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter is
melted, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a 4 l/2-quart bowl
of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. At
low speed, gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter-honey
mixture. Scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Continue to mix the batter at low speed until just warm, about 5
minutes. Cover the bowl and allow the batter to sit at room
temperature for 2 hours.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 F. Spray
a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Drop two 1 teaspoon-size
balls of the batter onto the sheet, 6 inches apart (begin by baking
only 2 tuiles at a time, to get an idea of how they will spread in
your oven). Bake the tuiles for 4 to 6 minutes, until golden brown.
Allow the tuiles to cool for 3 to 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then
carefully transfer them with a spatula to a wire rackto cool
completely. Continue this baking process, respraying the baking sheet
as necessary, until all the batter is used.
