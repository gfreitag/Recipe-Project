Title: WHITE ALMOND FUDGE
Categories: Candies, Desserts
3 oz pkg. cream cheese
Yield: 1 Lb
2 1/2 c  sifted confectioners sugar
1/2 ts almond extract
1/2 c  chopped almonds
1/8 ts salt

Beat cream cheese until smooth & soft with electric mixer set at
cream (or beat with a spoon).  Then slowly blend in remaining
ingredients. Press into a buttered 9x5x3" loaf pan. Chill until firm,
then cut in 21 pieces. Makes about 1 pound.

Variation:  Coconut White Fudge - Substitute 1/2 c. flaked or cookie
coconut for almonds.  Makes 21 pieces.

I'm sure you could leave out the almonds and use vanilla instead of
almond extract to make Vanilla Fudge, but I doubt it would turn out
white. Walt MM
