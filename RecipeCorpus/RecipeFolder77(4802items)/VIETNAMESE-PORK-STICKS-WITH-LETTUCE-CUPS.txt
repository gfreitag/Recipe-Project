FOR MEAT: Combine all ingredients in large bowl and use hands to mix
gently but thoroughly. Shape into 12 cylinders approximately 3 inches
long and no more than 1-inch thick. Insert bamboo skewer through each
cylinder and set aside. Arrange garnishes in individual bowls;
refrigerate.

FOR SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in small pan and bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Let cool. Divide among 4 small
bowls and set aside. Heat coals on barbecue until gray ash forms.
Spread into overlapping layer, knocking off ash so coals are hot and
glowing. Place grill 2 to 3 inches above coals or, preheat oven to
broil. Arrange pork sticks on grill or broiling pan so they do not
touch. Cook until meat is crisped, browned and firm, turning often
with tongs, about 10 to 15 minutes. Have each diner sprinkle lettuce
leaf with other garnishes. Slip pork off skewer onto lettuce.  Wrap
around pork and use sauce for dipping. Meat mixture can be prepared
and skewered up to 24 hours before barbecuing. Sauce will keep 2
weeks in refrigerator.
