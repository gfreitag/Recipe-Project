Categories: Meatless
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Canola oil
1 c  Diced onion
1 tb Minced garlic
1    Jalapeno -- seeded and

1    Red bell pepper -- seeded

2 tb Hoisin sauce
1 c  Cooked basmati rice
1/4 c  Pecans, dry-roasted --
Pulverized
1 1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
Salt
Dry-pan roast the pecans.  When cooled, process to a coarse powder.

Heat oil in a large skillet. Saute onion and garlic until onions turn
brown at the edges and garlic is golden. Add jalapeno, bell pepper
and mushrooms. Reduce heat, cover and cook until vegetables are
tender, 10 to15 minutes. Add hoisin sauce and mix well.

With a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a large bowl. Increase
heat and reduce the sauce remaining in the skillet until very thick,
stirring often for 5 to 10 minutes. Pour sauce over the vegetable
mixture. Place mixture and rice in the bowl of a food processor.
Pulse several times until the ingredients are thoroughly blended.
Transfer to a large bowl and mix in ground pecans and 1-1/4 cup
crumbs, with your hands. Season with salt.

Form into 3-inch patties about 1/2-inch thick, mixing in extra crumbs
if patties don't hold their shape. They will be delicate, so handle
gentle.

Broil or grill patties until brown on both sides and heated through.
Served on toasted buns with lettuce, onion and ketchup. Makes 12.

Pat H's notes.  Try chipotle mayo and sliced tomato.
Shape with burger press and waxed paper; freeze; fry (frozen patty)
with a little vegetable spray.
