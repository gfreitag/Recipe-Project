Title: WINTER SQUASH SOUP WITH CINNAMON & CLOVES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Dense winter squash such as
Butternut (we used pumpkin)
12    Corriander seeds
12    Peppercorns
2 c  Fatfree soymilk (we used the
Westbrae WestSoy)
1    3 inch cinnamon stick,
Broken into pieces
8    Cloves
1    Jalapeno pepper or 2 small
Dried red chilies, seeds
Removed
1    Onion, finely diced
2 ts Each finely chopped mint and
Cilantro for garnish (we
Skipped this)
Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds.  Cook the squash (We
put it in the microwave, but she recommends baking it at 375 for
30-45 minutes. We were afraid it'd dry out too much that way.) When
the squash is cooked and cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh.

While the squash is baking, make an infusion with the herbs and milk:
first lightly crush the corriander seeds and peppercorns; then put
them in a saucepan with the milk, cinnamon, cloves, and chilies. Heat
the mixture slowly, but turn off the heat just before the milk comes
to a boil Let it stand until needed.

Saute the onions in water until they begin to soften. Add the squash
and 1 qt. water.  Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer
until the squash is broken up, about 25 minutes.

Pass the soup through a food mill or blen it briefly, leaving as much
texture as you like.  Return the soup to the stove and add the milk,
pouring it through a strainer. Try to press on the spices as you do,
to get as much flavor into the soup as you can.  Gently reheat the
soup, but do not allow it to boil.  Serve garnished with cilantro and
mint.
