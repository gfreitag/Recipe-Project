1 1/8 c  Whole wheat flour
1 ts Salt

The only difference besides the whole wheat flour, is that this
recipe has no sugar at all...wonder why!? My Panasonic machine has a
setting for making  Whole Wheat Bread and this recipe is for making
the Whole Wheat Irish Soda Bread that I tried yesterday.  It was a
big hit!! BETTIE COOPER (VGXB82A)
