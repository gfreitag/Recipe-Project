Soldiers of the U.S. Army on the Western frontier had been eating
chili since the war with Mexico (1846) but not necessarily in their
messes. The first Army publication to give a recipe for chili was
published in 1896, The Manual For Army Cooks (War Department Document
#18). By World War I, the Army had added garlic and beans; by World
War II, tomatoes. This was a national pattern: Fannie Farmer did
exactly the same (see the editions for 1914, 1930, and 1941)

Chili con carne (1896) (per soldier). 1 beefsteak (round); 1 Tbs. hot
drippings; 2 Tbs. rice; 1 cup boiling water; 2 large dried red chile
pods; 1 cup boiling water; flour, salt, and onion (optional).

Cut steak in small pieces. Put in frying pan with hot drippings, cup
of hot water, and rice. Cover closely and cook slowly until tender.
Remove seeds and parts of veins from chile pods. Cover with second
cup of boiling water and let stand until cool. Then squeeze them in
the hand until the water is thick and red. If not thick enough, add a
little flour. Season with salt and a little onion, if desired. Pour
sauce over meat-rice mixture and serve very hot.
