Title: TUNA
Categories: Fish, Canning
Yield: 1 Text  Tuna may be canned either precooked or raw. Preooking removes most of
the strong-flavored oils. The strong flavor of dark tuna flesh
affects the delicate flavor of white flesh. Many people prefer not to
can dark flesh. It may be used as pet food.

Note: Glass-like crystals of magnesium ammonium phosphate sometimes
form in canned tuna. There is no way for the home canner to prevent
these crystals from forming, but they usually dissolve when heated
and are safe to eat.

Procedure: Keep tuna on ice until ready to can. Remove viscera and
wash fish well in cold water. Allow blood to drain from stomach
cavity. Place fish belly down on a rack or metal tray in the bottom
of a large baking pan. Cut tuna in half crosswise, if necessary.
Precook fish by baking at 250 degrees F for 2-1/2 to 4 hours
(depending on size) or at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. The fish may also
be cooked in a steamer for 2 to 4 hours. If a thermometer is used,
cook to a 165 to 175 degree F internal temperature. Refrigerate
cooked fish overnight to firm the meat. Peel off the skin with a
knife, removing blood vessels and any discolored flesh. Cut meat away
from bones; cut out and discard all bones, fin bases, and dark flesh.
Quarter. Cut quarters crosswise into lengths suitable for half-pint
or pint jars. Fill into jars, pressing down gently to make a solid
pack. Tuna may be packed in water or oil, whichever is preferred. Add
water or oil to jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1/2 teaspoon of
salt per half-pint or 1 teaspoon of salt per pint, if desired.

Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or
Table 2 according to the canning method used.
