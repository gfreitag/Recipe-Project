Preheat the oven to 350B0F20 Dredge the venison shanks in flour and
shake off excess. Season with salt and pepper. In a deep flameproof
casserole or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and brown the
shanks on all sides. Remove the shanks, wipe the casserole clean and
add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil along with the onions, garlic,
celery, and carrots. Saute until lightly browned. Add the tomatoes,
stock, wine, olives and seasonings. Return the shanks to the
casserole, scooping some of the vegetable mixture on top of them.

Cover the casserole and bake for 2 hours. Uncover and cook 30 minutes
more or until the venison is very tender. Remove the shanks and set
aside.

Strain the braising liquid and reserve the vegetables. Degrease the
braising liquid and return it to the casserole. Over high heat, cook
the liquid until reduced to a light sauce consistency. Return the
meat and vegetables to the casserole and heat through. Adjust
seasoning with salt and pepper.

In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the gremolata.

Serve the venison shanks in wide-rimmed soup bowls and ladle the hot
braising liquid around. Sprinkle with the gremolata and garnish with
herb sprigs.
