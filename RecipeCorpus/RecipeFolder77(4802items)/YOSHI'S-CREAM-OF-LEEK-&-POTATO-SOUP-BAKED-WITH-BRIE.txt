2    Leeks;*
1 md Onion; peeled/chopped
1 lg Clove garlic; peeled/chopped
2 lg Potatoes; peeled/diced
2 qt Chicken stock
1/2 c  Heavy cream

Melt butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add leeks, onion and
garlic. Saute until wilted.  Add potatoes, stirring well. Add stock,
bring to a boil and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes.
Strain off broth and set aside. Put solids in a food processor and
puree, leaving slight texture.  Return stock and puree to the pot,

add salt, tasting as you go (less salt may be needed if stock is

on each.  Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven until Brie is melted,
about 6 or 7 minutes. Serve immediately.
