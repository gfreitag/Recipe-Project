Title: TORTILLA ROLLS UPS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
Large Flour Tortillas
Cream cheese
Thin sliced deli meat;
-corned beef, roast beef,
-ham, turkey
Butter or red lettuce leaves
Spread cream cheese over tortilla, you may add seasonings of choice
to the cream cheese if you like. Place thin meat a combo, or the same
over cream cheese.  Then the lettuce leaves. roll up like a jelly
roll and slice in bite size peices for appetisers and impress your
guests. A nice filling addition would be thin slices or mashed
advocado too, or even some black olives...why didn't I think of that
before? <G> They make a good sandwich change for lunches, esp. for
kid's. I know there is a fancy name for these, but it escapes me at
the moment.
