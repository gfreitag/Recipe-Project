1.  Preheat oven to 450F.  In medium bowl, combine cheese, salami and
tomatoes; toss.

2.  Divide dough into 6 pieces.  On floured surface, with floured
rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into 7 inch round. Top left
half of each round with cheese mixture, dividing evenly. Moisten
edges with water; fold right side of dough over so edges meet. Press
edges to seal; crimp. Place on large baking sheet; with scissors,
make three 1/2 inch slits in top of each.

3.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until well-browned.  Cool briefly before
serving.
