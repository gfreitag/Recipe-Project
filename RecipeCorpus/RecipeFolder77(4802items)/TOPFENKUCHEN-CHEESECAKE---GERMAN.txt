Title: TOPFENKUCHEN CHEESECAKE - GERMAN
Categories: Cheesecakes, Cakes, German
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  Flour; sift on pastry board
1/2 c  Sugar
2    Egg yolks
1 c  Butter; softened
2 ts Lemon rind; grated
1 1/2 c  Cottage cheese; sieved
4    Egg yolks
2 ts Lemon rind; grated
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
4    Egg whites
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Almonds; slivered/blanched
Make a well in the center of the flour and put into it the next four
ingredients.  Quickly work these ingredients into the flour to make a
smooth dough, adding a bit more flour if needed, to facilitate
handling. On a floured board, roll out the dough into a 11X17"
rectangle. Line a baking sheet with the dough and bake it in a
moderate oven (350 degrees F>), for about 15 minutes, or until it is
about half done.
Let it cool. Add the 4 egg yolks and lemon rind to the cottage
cheese. Beat the egg whites until very stiff, gradually adding the
sugar, beginning when they have slightly stiffened. Fold the beaten
egg whites into the cheese and spread the cooled pastry shell with
the cheese filling. Sprinkle the cake with the raisins and almonds.
Bake in a very slow oven (250 degrees F.) about 45 minutes. Let cool
and cut into large squares. Gourmet's Old Vienna Cookbook
