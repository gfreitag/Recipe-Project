Boil chicken breasts in 3 quarts water for approximately 30 minutes.
Remove and reserve stock. Shred chicken breasts.

Saute chopped onion, celery, garlic, peppers, and tomatoes. Add
spices and masa to vegetables and stir. Add shredded chicken and
vegetable mix to reserved chicken stock. Simmer for 1 hour.

Cut and fry strips or wedges of corn tortillas in oil in skillet.
Drain well.  (or used purchased tortilla chips-baked if you want to
save fat.)

To serve soup, garnish with tortilla chips and grated cheese. (or
leave off cheese to reduce fat.)

This is low calorie and low in fat if you leave out chips and cheese.

I also had tortilla soup at ChiChi's and they just used chicken in a
broth with onions, and cubes of zucchini and different colors of
squash. It was really tasty also.
