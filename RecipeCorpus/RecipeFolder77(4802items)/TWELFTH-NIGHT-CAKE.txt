Stephen Ceideburg
1 1/3 c  Hazelnuts
3 tb Unsalted butter, softened
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1    Egg yolk
1 tb Finely shredded orange zest
2 tb Grand Marnier
17 1/4 oz Frozen puff pastry dough,
-thawed
1    Dried bean
1    Egg, beaten
1 tb Powdered sugar
Toast hazelnuts on baking sheet at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Cool
and then rub in a tea towel to remove skins. Finely grind nuts in food
processor. Set aside.

Beat butter and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium to
high speed until light and fluffy. Add egg yolk and beat until
well-blended. Gradually add nuts and mix on low to medium speed. Stir
in orange zest and Grand Marnier. Set aside.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 sheet of puff pastry
slightly to remove crease. Trim to an 8-inch circle and place on a
greased baking sheet. Heap nut filling over pastry in dome shape,
leaving 1-inch border. Hide bean in filling.

Roll out remaining pastry as above and trim to a 10-inch circle.
Brush edge of bottom pastry with beaten egg. Cover with second circle
of dough and tuck edges under. Press to seal tightly. Crimp edges.
For a glossy crust, brush top with beaten egg. Chill cake at least 30
minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

With a small sharp knife, score cake in eighths, radiating from top
and center to within 1 inch of edge. Brush again with beaten egg.
Bake about 30 minutes, or until golden. Cool on wire rack. Dust with
powdered sugar.

From the Oregonian FOODday, 1/5/93.
