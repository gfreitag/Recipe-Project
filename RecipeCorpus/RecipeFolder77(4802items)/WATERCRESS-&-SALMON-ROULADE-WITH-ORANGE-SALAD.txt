Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
213 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
3 bn Watercress
- washed and trimmed
3    Oranges
1    Carrot; peeled
- shredded or thinly sliced
2 tb Sunflower or sesame oil
2 ts Sesame seeds
Seasoning to taste
15 g  Polyunsaturated margarine
15 g  Plain flour
50 g  Peeled prawns; chopped
50 g  Button mushrooms; chopped
4    Eggs; separated
Pre-heat oven to 200 C, 400 F, Gas mark 6.

Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Flake the fish into a
bowl. Line a 35cm / 14inch by 20cm / 8inch swiss roll tin with
silicone paper and brush it lightly with oil. Put one bunch of
watercress into a bowl. Cut two of the oranges into segments and
squeeze the juice of the third. Mix the orange segments and the
carrot into the watercress and set aside. Mix together the orange
juice, oil and sesame seeds. Season lightly.

Melt the margarine in a small pan and stir in the flour. Gradually
add the salmon stock, stirring to prevent lumps. Stir the prawns and
mushrooms into the sauce and cook gently for two minutes before
adding the flaked salmon and mixing well. Set aside.

Chop the remaining two bunches of watercress very finely. Beat the egg
yolks and chopped watercress together then season. Whisk the egg
whites until they form soft peaks then fold into the watercress
mixture. Spread into the lined tin and bake for l0 minutes.

When cooked, loosen the sides of the watercress roulade and quickly
turn out onto a flat surface. Peel away the silicone paper and spread
the salmon sauce evenly over the roulade. Quickly roll up, swiss roll
fashion and trim the edges.

Mix the orange juice dressing into the watercress salad and serve with
slices of the roulade.
