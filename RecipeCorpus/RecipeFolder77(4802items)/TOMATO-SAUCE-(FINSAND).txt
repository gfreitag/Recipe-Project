Title: TOMATO SAUCE (FINSAND)
Categories: Diabetic, Sauces, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Batch
Firm red tomatoes (or canned
-tomatoes without seasonings
Quarter the tomatoes.  Place in large kettle.  Push down with hands
or back of spoon to render some juice. Bake at 325 degrees until soft
pulp remains. Spoon into blender. Blend until smooth. Seal in
sterilized jars or freeze. NOTE: Freeze in a ice cube trays. I think
2 cubes is about 1/4 cup.
