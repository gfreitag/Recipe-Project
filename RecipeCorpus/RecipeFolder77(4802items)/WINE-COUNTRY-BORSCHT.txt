In a stockpot, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the beef in
batches and quickly brown on all sides. Remove the meat and reserve.
Add the carrots, onions, garlic and celery. Saute until the
vegetables are lightly colored. Return the beef to the pot and add
the raw beets, tomatoes, stock, wine, fennel seed and thyme. Bring to
a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer partially covered for 1 1/2 to 2
hours or until the beef is very tender. Occasionally skim off the fat
as the borscht simmers.

Strain the soup carefully, pressing down gently on the meat and
vegetables to extract as much liquid as possible. Set aside the beef
cubes and discard the remaining vegetables, if desired. Return the
beef and strained liquid to the stockpot. (The soup can be made ahead
to this point and refrigerated overnight.) Add the balsamic vinegar
and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the parsley and keep warm.

In a separate saucepan, in lightly salted boiling water, blanch the
potatoes until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm. In a
medium saute pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the
cabbage and caraway seed. Saute until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.

To serve, ladle the borscht into warm soup bowls. Add the roasted
beets, potatoes and sauteed cabbage. Garnish with a dollop of sour
cream.
