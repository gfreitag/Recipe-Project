Title: WHITE STOCK
Categories: Soups
5 ga Water
Yield: 1 Servings
10 Lb Beef Bones -- sawn
10 Lb Veal Bones -- sawn
5 Lb Chicken Backs -- or feet
1/2    Celery Stalk -- chopped
1    Leek -- chopped
2    Onions -- chopped
1/2 bn Parsley Stems
5    Bay Leaves
1 TB Peppercorns -- crushed
1/2 TB Thyme Leaf

1. Blanch the bones by covering with cold water and bringing to the
boil. Discard water and rinse bones.

2. Add remaining ingredients. Bring to the boil, then simmer for up
to 18 hours, with skimming to remove any scum that rises.

3. Scald clean containers, and strain stock into each, seeing some
fat into each to act as a protective cap. Cover with saran and cool.

4. This will keep at least a week, but should be part of the regular
weekly Mise en place. Excess should be frozen or reduced for glace
d'viand, a 10-1 reduction.

NOTES:

These recipes are for 5 gallons, but you can cut them in half. It
hardly pays to make less than 10 quarts, but if space is a factor,
reduce the stock by boiling to half its original volume. The flavors
will be more pronounced, as will any errors introduced.
