Title: WATKINS CARAMEL APPLE DIP
Categories: Dips
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Cream cheese -- softened
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 ts WATKINS Vanilla
1/2 ts Caramel Extract
You can use lite or regular cream cheese. I like the already creamed
variety.  Brown sugar can be increase to 1/3 cup if preferred. As far
as I know only Watkins makes Caramel Extract.

Mix well all ingredients until very smooth and creamy. Chill and
serve with sliced apples.  Sliced pears and green seedless grapes are
also good with this dip. Remember to treat apples with either lemon
juice or some sort of commercial product that prevents sliced apples
from turning brown.

This is one of our most popular tasties.  Everyone who tastes it,
requests the recipe.
