Title: TROUT SERVED COLD IN ASPIC
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Poached trout
1 c  Tomato sauce
4 ts Gelatin
Parsley
Lemon slices
If you'd like to serve the trout as a fish course in aspic, let the
trout cool in the liquor, then remove and drain the trout.
Strain the liquor the trout were simmered in, add to it the tomato
sauce, and over fire stir in the gelatin. Stir over low heat just
until the gelatin melts. Set gelatin liquid in refrigerator until it
cools but is not as yet "set."
Arrange trout in a flat dish, pour over them the aspic, and allow
to set.
Arrange parsley and then lemon slices around the trout and serve.
