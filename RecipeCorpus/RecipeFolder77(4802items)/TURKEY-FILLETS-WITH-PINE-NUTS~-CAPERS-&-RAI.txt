Pat the turkey fillets dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and

You will probably need to sear the turkey in batches so that it will
brown. Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Spray
one side of the turkey fillets with Bakers Joy. Cook 1-2 minutes or
until golden. Spray the remaining side, turn and cook for an
additional minute. Hold seared turkey fillets on a warm plate and
repeat with remainder.

Add the raisins, wine, capers and chicken broth mixed with cornstarch
to the same pan, stirring constantly until slightly thickened. Return
turkey to the pan to heat.

Serve turkey on individualy plates with sauce spooned over the top.
Sprinkle each portion with toasted pine nuts.
