Molasses is known as treacle in the U.K.  These scones are fragrant
and chewy; very nice on a cold afternoon.

Preheat oven to 400F (205C).  Lightly grease a large baking sheet; set
aside.  Sift flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl; set
aside. In a medium-size saucepan, combine molasses and 2 tablespoons
butter; stir over low heat until butter is melted. Make a well in the
center of dry ingredients; add molasses mixture and milk and mix with
a form to form a soft dough.  Turn out onto floured surfaces. Roll
out with a floured rolling pan or pat dough with your hands to form a
round about 1/2-inch thick.  Cut into rounds with a 2-inch fluted or
plain cookie cutter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until well risen and golden. Transfer to a
wire rack and cool 5 minutes. Split and serve warm with butter. Makes
12 to 15 scones.
