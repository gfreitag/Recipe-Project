Yum kai kem is a simple, country-style accompaniment to rice, and is
often served with green curries as a sharp, salty complement to their
rich, fiery heat.

Peel the eggs, halve them lengthwise, and arrange them on serving
dish. Sprinkle the chili slices and shallots over the eggs. Drizzle
with lime juice and serve.
