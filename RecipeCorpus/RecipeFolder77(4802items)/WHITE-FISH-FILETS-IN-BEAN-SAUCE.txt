Title: WHITE FISH FILETS IN BEAN SAUCE
Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Fish filets (soft flesh fish
-like sole)
1/2 c  Dry sherry
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Thin soy sauce
1/2 ts Fresh ginger, minced
1 tb Cloud Ear black fungus (or
-water chestnuts)
2/3 c  Chicken stock
1/2 ts Szechwan Soybean Paste
1 ts Cornstarch paste (approx)
1/2 ts Sesame oil
Cook this dish quickly so fish will be flaky and tender.

Preparation:  Wash and soak Cloud Ear fungus for about 30 minutes or
until soft; drain.  Slice fish filets into 2" squares; marinate in
sherry, sugar and soy sauce for 15 minutes. Mix stock and soybean
paste; add in half the marinade when fish is removed.

Cooking:  Heat wok to high.  Add stock mixture; when it comes to slow
boil, add ginger and Cloud Ear fungus; cook fungus for about 1
minute. Dribble in cornstarch paste; keep stirring as you do; sauce
should attain a medium consistency.  Allow sauce to cook for another
minute. Reduce heat to medium, then introduce fish pieces. Poach for
about 1 minute or until flaky and milky white.  Avoid overcooking.
Stir in sesame oil. Serve.

Variation:  Use thinly sliced water chestnuts in place of Cloud Ear
black fungus; garnish with minced green onion.
