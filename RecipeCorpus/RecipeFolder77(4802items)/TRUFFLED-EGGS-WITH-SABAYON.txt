place while you prepare truffled eggs.

Prepare truffled eggs: In a blender combine eggs with truffle oil and
season with salt and pepper; blend until foamy. In a skillet,
preferably nonstick, melt butter over medium-low heat. When butter is
bubbly pour in eggs and cook, stirring constantly with a rubber
spatula until just set.

To assemble: Divide eggs between 2 heated plates and spoon sabayon
sauce around edges. Surround with bacon slices and sprinkle with
chives. Drizzle with truffle oil and serve immediately.
