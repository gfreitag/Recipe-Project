Return-Path: <jasonber@bilbo.bio.purdue.edu> A really cool party
drink. In a very large GLASS bottle, like the ones cheap wine come
in, add one full bottle of vodka (absolute) of either proof. Now
strain 6 lemons and 3 limes and add the juice (and the rines if you
prefer) to the bottle. Now add 1 cup sugar (more or less to taste).
Now fill the bottle with ice, wrap it in a towel, and SHAKE IT!
That's right, shake this mixture for 1 hour. Pass it around so
everyone gets a shake. After an hour, drink and enjoy. Tastes just
like lemonade.
