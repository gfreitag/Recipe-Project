Title: WHOLE WHEAT DOUBLE PIE CRUST
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 c  Unbleached white flour
1/2 c  Butter
1/4 c  Apple juice
Using knives, cut together flour and butter until butter is small
marble- sized.  Make a well, and quickly pour and cut in the juice.
Move the dough to a floured surface and gently knead together for two
minutes. Separate into two balls for the top and bottom crusts. Roll
out with floured rolling pin. Place one on bottom and sides of 8 or
9-inch pie plate. Add pie filling and cover with top dough. Seal
edges and prick top crust with fork so pie can breathe while cooking.
Bake at 350 degrees, 35-60 minutes, depending on filling. Top crust
will be browned and possibly bubbling at the fork holes when
finished. Use one-half of this recipe for a one-crust pie. Makes 1
double pie crust
