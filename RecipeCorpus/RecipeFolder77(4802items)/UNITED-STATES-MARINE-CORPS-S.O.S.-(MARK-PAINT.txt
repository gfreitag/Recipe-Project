Categories: Main dish, Meats, Sauces
Yield: 5 Servings
1 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
5/8 c  Chopped onions
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Butter not margarine
3 tb Flour
2 ts Garlic powder
2 c  Milk
Salt and pepper to taste
Over medium heat, in a large sauce pan, brown the meat. Stir
thoroughly to break up the ground beef into small pieces. Drain and
add the butter, stir thoroughly. Add onions and cook until
translucent. Add flour, stir and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic, soy
sauce, worcestershire sauce and stir thoroughly. Add milk and stir
until mixture thickens. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Try eating this on hash-brown potatoes instead of toast or biscuits,
it makes all the difference in the world.

Use a coarse cheese grater to grate one medium potato per person. Fry
'em up in a little butter. No salt needed because they're going to be
smothered with s.o.s.

Many thanks to Mark Painter and the U.S.M.C. for the recipe. Semper
