Title: WARM GRAPEFRUIT & BABY SPINACH SALAD
Categories: Salads, Appetizers, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Red wine vinegar
2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 ts Pepper
1 1/2 ts Butter
1 lg Grapefruit, peeled, cut
-- into sections & halved
1 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 lb Baby spinach leaves
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, and pepper to
make a vinaigrette. Set aside.

In a large, nonreactive skillet over medium-high heat, melt the
butter. When the butter begins to foam, add the grapefruit, paprika,
and salt. Reduce the heat slightly and saute until the grapefruit is
heated through, 2-3 min. Add the spinach leaves and gently fold them
together with the warm fruit just long enough to wilt the spinach,
about 45 seconds.

Transfer the warm spinach-grapefruit mixture to a salad bowl and add
the vinaigrette. Toss well and divide among 6 individual salad plates.
