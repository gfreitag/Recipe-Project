If you don't like making bagels but want the texture of bagels with
the low-fat nutritional benefits; try this bread. It tastes like a
bagel and is especially good sliced and toasted.

There is one note for the Panasonic/National machines and that is to
use 3 tsp yeast for 1 1/2 lb loaf.  I believe that this is for the
older Panasonics as I do remember Linda Rehberg saying that the newer
models came out after their book was published and that the yeast
amounts in her book were not for the newer Panasonics. Upon
re-reading I found I missed one thing. I did add a few more tsps of
water as the dough ball was not forming to my liking.  Let me know if
you make this and how you like it.
