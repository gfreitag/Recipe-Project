Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Oil
2    Garlic cloves; diced
1    Onion; diced
1    Carrot; diced
1    Bell pepper, green or red
- diced
1    Celery stick; diced
2 tb Tamari
2 lb Tofu; mashed
4 sl Whole wheat bread
1 tb Oil
1 tb Tamari
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 c  Nutritional yeast*
1/2 c  Tahini
1/2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Tumeric
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet.  Add garlic, onion, pepper,
carrot & celery.  Season with 1 tablespoon tamari. When vegetables
are tender, remove from the heat & place in a large bowl. Add mashed
tofu. Cut bread into crouton sized pieces & quick fry in oil with
tamari, garlic powder & five tablespoons of nutritional yeast. Add to
tofu mixture. Season with remaining ingredients.  Combine well &
place the batter into a well greased casserole. Bake at 350F for 35
minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes or so, slide a butter knife
around the edges, turn upside down on a plate. Serve warm with a
simple green salad.  It is also terrific in sandwiches cold. It keeps
pretty well in the fridge for several days. Serves 4 to 6. *When
using this amount of nutritional yeast, be sure to use a good quality
product.  I speak here from experience. Something like angevita is
disgusting when used in large quantities. Apart from that, enjoy-
