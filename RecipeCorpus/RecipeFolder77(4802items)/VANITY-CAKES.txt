a time, until batter is too stiff for beating but too soft to roll
out. Cover a dinner plate with flour. With a teaspoon, spoon batter
onto plate in 6 separate portions. with knife turn each over to
flour, then drop into hot fat. Aim for limp but compact dough mass
that will not string out when it leaves the knife. Cook each cake for

paper & dust with sugar. Submitted By THESERVS@GATE.NET (THOMAS E.
