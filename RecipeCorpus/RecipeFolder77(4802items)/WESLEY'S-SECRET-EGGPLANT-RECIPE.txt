Title: WESLEY'S SECRET EGGPLANT RECIPE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Eggplants, or however many
You can afford
1    Litre Kentucky Bourbon
Directions: OK, first, you take all the eggplant you have, and grind
it up very finely in the kitchen sink built-in grinder...SAFETY
TIP...watch out for finger tips & Bourbon bottles.

(Whoops, it all went down the drain?  Oh, well...)

2nd, take the Bourbon and mix it well with water, 7-up, or a generic
substitute.  By this time, the odor and texture of the eggplant
should be gone.

Rinse out your sink, and apply the Bourbon mixture internally.

Now, THERE's an eggplant recipe I can live with!

Next time, we'll try it with a wine sauce!
