Title: WAS-NAH CORN & CHERRY SNACK
Categories: Snacks, Native amer
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Bing cherries, seeded
1/2 lb Butter, softened
2 c  Brown sugar
To be authentic, use chokecherries in place of the Bing cherries,
maple sugar or syrup in place of the sugar and buffalo kidney fat (or
beef suet?) in place of the butter.

Place the cornmeal on a cookie sheet and toast it in a 325 degree oven
until it begins to brown. Careful -- this will not take long.

Drain the cherries well and chop coarsely. Mix all ingredients
together well and chill in the refrigerator. To serve, simply dish
out by the tablespoonful. It is eaten like candy.
