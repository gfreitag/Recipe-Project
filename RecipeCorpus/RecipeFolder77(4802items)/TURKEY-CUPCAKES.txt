form each body, take a large gumdrop and press a piece of candy corn
into the center at an angle to resemble the beak. Cut each red
gumdrop into 12 thin strips, about 1/4 inch long, and press one strip
below each beak to form "wattle". Place one completely gumdrop in the
center of each cupcake. To form feathers, arrange about 5 candy corn
pieces in a half circle around the edge of each cupcake, points
toward center.
