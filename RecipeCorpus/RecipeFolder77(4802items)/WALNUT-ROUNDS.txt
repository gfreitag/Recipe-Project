1/2 c  Potato flour
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Margarine, softened
1/2 c  Walnuts, finely chopped &

Preheat oven to 350F. Mix flours & salt together in a large bowl. Cut
in the margarine until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add
walnuts & stir until they are evenly distributed in the flour. Blend
in enough water to form a cohesive ball. Add more water if necessary.
The dough should be a little sticky. Wrap dough in waxed paper &
chill for at least 1/2 hour. Divide into 2 equal portions.  Roll out
to 1/8" thickness. If desired, sprinkle tops with salt & roll over
with rolling pin. With a round cookie cutter, cut into 2" rounds.
Place onto a lightly greased cookie sheet & prick with a fork. Bake
for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Serve
with spreads.
