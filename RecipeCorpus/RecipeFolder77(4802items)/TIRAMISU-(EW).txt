Title: TIRAMISU (EW)
Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 12 Servings
8 oz Ladyfingers (60 ladyfingers)
4 tb Brandy
1 tb Instant coffee (preferably
-espresso) granules
3    Large egg whites
1 c  Plus 2 T sugar
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
4 oz Mascarpone cheese (1/2 C)
4 oz Reduced-fat cream cheese
-(1/2 c), softened
Chocolate shavings &
Confectioners' sugar for
Garnish
If ladyfingers are soft, toast them in a 350 degree F oven for 6 to 8
minutes.

In a small bowl, stir together 3 T of the brandy, coffee granules and
1 cup water.  Brush over the flat side of the ladyfingers. Set aside.

Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in the bottom of a large
saucepan. Combine egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and 3 T cold
water in a heatproof mixing bowl that will fit over the saucepan. Set
the bowl over the simmering water and beat with a hand-held mixer at
low speed until an instant-read or candy thermometer registers 140
degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes. Increase speed to high and continue
beating over heat for 3 minutes (The mixture should form a ribbon
trail.) Remove the bowl from the heat and beat until cool and fluffy,
about 4 minutes. Set aside.

In a large bowl, beat mascarpone and cream cheese until creamy. Add
about 1 cup of the beaten whites and the remaining 1 T brandy and
beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Fold in the
remaining whites.

Line the bottom and sides of a 3 quart trifle bowl or souffle dish
with ladyfingers.  Spoon in one-quarter of the filling and tip with a
layer of ladyfingers. Repeat with two more layers of filling and
ladyfinters, arranging the fourth layer of ladyfingers decoratively
over the top, trimming to fit, if necessary. Top with the remaining
filling. Garnish with chocolate shavings.  Cover and chill for at
least 8 hours or overnight. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.
