In a large pot, saut the onion and garlic in the olive oil (put the
onion in first, and add the garlic when the onion starts to look a
little translucent) for about 10 minutes.

Run the garbanzo beans and tomatoes through a blender or food
processor until they are finely chopped, but not smooth.

Add all the ingredients to the pot, and simmer, uncovered, for 45
minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally.

This sauce is great over all sorts of pasta.

Delights Cookbook

20 minutes preparation, 1 hour to simmer. Makes enough for 4-6 people.

My changes were to increase the garlic, substitute a grated carrot
for the honey, add oregano and mushrooms, and use another can of
tomatoes rather than fresh tomatoes, and retain the texture of
chopped vegetables by blending only the tomatoes and garbanzos.
