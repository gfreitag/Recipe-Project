Title: WARM SPRINGS FRIED BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 tb Butter
2 ts Baking powder
3/4 c  (to 1c) Warm milk
1 ts Salt
2 tb Melted butter
1 ts Sugar
Fat for deep frying
Combine dry ingredients; cut in butter. Add enough warm milk to make
a soft dough, easy to handle. Knead on floured board until dough is
very smooth and soft but elastic. Do not use a lot of extra flour.
Divide dough into 6-8 balls and brush the tops with melted butter.
Cover and let stand 30-45 minutes. Pat out each ball into a round, 5
or 6 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Fry in deep fat
(preheated to 365 degrees). Dough should rise immediately to surface.
Cook until brown on one side, turn, and brown on other side being
careful to not pierce crust. Drain on absorbent paper and serve hot.
