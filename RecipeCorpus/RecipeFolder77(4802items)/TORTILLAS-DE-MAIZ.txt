Title: TORTILLAS DE MAIZ
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 kg Corn fluor, In Mexico we use
"Mimsa" or "Maseca"

The Yield depends to the size of tortillas. Mix the fluor with the
water, adding water as you needed, the dough will be done when you
easy can make a little ball with your hands, make the balls and do
the tortillas with a rolling pin, or with the machine for make
tortillas, then cook in a "comal" the comal must be hot; if you do
not have "comal", you can use something with "Teflon". Cook one side
