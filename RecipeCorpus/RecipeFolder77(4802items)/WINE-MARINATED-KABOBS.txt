~----------------- Shape the meat by TBLS into 24 balls. Place in a
glass bowl or plastic bag. Add the mushrooms. Mix the remaining
ingredients together and pour over the meatballs and mushrooms.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, turning the meatballs and
mushrooms occasionally. On each of 4 12-inch metal skewers, alternate
6 meatballs with 6 mushrooms. Set oven control to broil and/or 550
degrees F. Broil kabobs 4-inches from the heat to the desired
doneness, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Brush occasionally with the
remaining marinade and gently push with a fork to turn.
