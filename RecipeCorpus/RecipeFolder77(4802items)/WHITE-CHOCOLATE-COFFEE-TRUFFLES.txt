Categories: Candies, Christmas
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Whipping cream
1 tb Instant espresso or coffee
-powder
14 oz White chocolate, very finely
-chopped
2 tb Kahlua
Dipping chocolate:
1 lb White chocolate, very finely
-chopped
2 ts Vegetable oil
3 tb Chocolate-covered coffee
-beans, very finely chopped
1. To make the truffles: In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and
espresso powder to a boil.  pour over the chocolate and whisk until
completely melted. whisk in the Kahlua. Refrigerate until completely
chilled and firm.

2. With a tsp, place pieces of the chocolate onto a foil-lined baking
sheet.  Refrigerate to firm; roll into balls and refrigerate again for
about 30 minutes.

3. To prepare the dipping chocolate: In the top of a double boiler
set over hot water, place the chocolate and oil. stir until almost
melted. Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat and stir
until the chocolate has completely melted.  continue to stir until
the chocolate has cooled and reaches a temperature of 90 degrees.

4. Prepare 2 baking sheets by lining with aluminum foil. Dip each
candy center in the melted chocolate, shake off the excess and place
on the baking sheet. When you have dipped a row of candies, top each
with a little of the chocolate- covered coffee bean.  Before each
dipping, stir the chocolate vigorously with your fingers. If the
centers become too soft, chill for about 30 minutes.

5. Let the candies set for about 2 hours before storing in
refrigeration. If the centers start to come through the bottoms of
the chocolates, as often happens with soft mixtures, dip the bottoms
again in melted and cooled chocolate.
