Title: UN-FRIED FRENCH FRIES-DALEY
Categories: Potatoes, Low-fat/low
Yield: 4 Servings
5 lg Baking potatoes -- about 2
3/4 lb T
Light vegetable oil spray
2 lg Egg whites
1 tb Cajun spice
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Slice each potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch ovals, then slice even oval
lengthwise into matchsticks.

Coat a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegtable oil (like PAM).

Combine the egg whites and Cajun spice in a bowl.  Add the matchstick
potatoes and mix to coat.  Pour the coated potatoes onto the prepared
baking sheet and spread them out into a single layers, leaving a
little space between.

Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven. Bake for 40
to 45 minutes, until the fries are crispy, turning them every 6 to 8
minutes with a spatula so that they brown evenly. Serve immediately.
