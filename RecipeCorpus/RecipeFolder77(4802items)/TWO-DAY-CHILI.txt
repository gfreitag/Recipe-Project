Title: TWO-DAY CHILI
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Black beans, soaked starting
In the early a.m.
1 c  Brown rice (med. grain)
28 oz Can diced tomatoes with
Sauce
2    To 3 med./lg. onions,
Chopped
3 lg Carrots, diced
1    Garlic cloves to taste,
Chopped
1    Chili powder to taste
1    Cumin to taste
Cook brown rice and soaked beans in water to cover in crockpot set to
high (overnight).  In the morning, add saute'd veggies, canned
tomatoes and spices. Continue cooking on high (watch the water level)
until dinner for flavors to blend.  Serve over
rice/potatoes/tortillas, etc.

I made some black bean chili last week (black beans, canned tomatoes,
saute'd onions and carrots, spices) - from scratch - a crockpot full.
And added a "secret ingredient" - brown rice, which I added when I
started to cook the (presoaked) beans - overnight at high in the
crockpot. All my SAD friends who ate it thought it was *great*, and
that it contained m**t (actually, no added f*t, no added m**t - just
what was in the rice, etc ;-)
