Title: WHITE FORMULA FOR FACE PAINTING
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 6 Servings
2 ts White shortening
5 ts Corn starch
1 ts White flour
glycerin food color

Use rubber spatula, blend first 3 ingredients on a plate to form a
smooth paste.  Add 3-4 drops of glycerin for creamy consistency. Any
food coloring can be added. (I used green. At that time my kid was
"into" THE HULK)

For brown beards, or caveman styles, just add 2-1/2 tsp cocoa to the
above mixture.

My kids thought it was great....and this goes back many years, since
my youngest is now 18.  The only problem I encountered was that over
time (couple of hours) the heat from the faces, tended to make the
solution shiny and it started to melt.  But it is better than using
regular make-up, or spending money on store bought if you are short
of funds.
