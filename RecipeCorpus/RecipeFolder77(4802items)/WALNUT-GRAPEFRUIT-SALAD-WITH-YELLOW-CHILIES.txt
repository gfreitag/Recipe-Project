1 c  Peeled, diced jicama

Chilies and citrus fruits combine in a powerful combination of
vitamin C and flavor. This salad complements fish and poultry
especially well. Jicama, a crunchy, mild flavored tuber, is available
at Latin markets and in many supermarkets.

Cut fruit sections away from their surrounding membranes into a bowl.
Add jicama, chilies, oil, vinegar, lime juice, parsley and sugar and
toss to coat. Let salad stand at room temperature for 1 hour. (The
salad can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated overnight.)

Just before serving, sprinkle the salad with walnuts.
