Title: VEGETABLES LO MEIN
Categories: Chinese
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 lb Soft, fresh wheat flour
Noodles
6    Dried Jyo mushrooms (OR
10    Nami mushrooms)
3    Large stalks celery
1/2 c  Sliced bamboo shoots
2 tb Cooking oil
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Chicken broth
1/2 ts Sugar
Cornstarch paste
Noodles:  Add soft noodles to boiling salted water; stir with
chopsticks & cook until noodles lose their floury taste but are still
firm. Immediately drain in colander & rinse in cold water to arrest
cooking process. If you hold noodles for more than 10 minutes toss
them with a little oil to prevent sticking.

Vegetables:  Soak Jyo mushrooms for 2 hours in warm water (1 hour for
Nami mushrooms); slice in thin strips. Slice celery with the grain in
thin strips about 3" long. Cut bamboo shoots in strips to match
celery.

Stir-Frying:  Heat wok to medium-high. When hot, dribble oil around
side of pan. Add salt; stir briefly. Add mushrooms & bamboo shoots;
stir for about 30 seconds. Add celery, stir vigorously for 30
seconds. Push vegetables up side of wok; add broth & sugar, bring to
boil.

Add noodles, a handful at a time, stirring them into broth for about
20 seconds. Combine vegetables & noodles, cover wok, steam for 30
seconds. Push all ingredients to side. If necessary, thicken juices
slightly with cornstarch paste.  Add paste a little at a time,
stirring constantly. Serve immediately.
