Title: VEGAN LONDON BROIL
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 6oz steaks
2 1/2 lb Raw Seitan
- (2 boxes Seitan Quick Mix)
1/2 ga Water
1 1/2 c  Tamari soy sauce
1    7-inch strip kombu
-- (sea vegetable)
6 sl Fresh ginger (thin slices)
Sauce
-- (such as Bordelaise
-- or Miso sauces)
Prep time: 30 minutes

Place Seitan in an 8-inch square cake pan.  Allow to rest until it
takes the shape of the pan.  Place this pan inside a second, larger
pan that is half-filled with water. Cover the larger pan. Bake in a
pre-heated oven at 375 F. for 1 hour.  When Seitan is done, remove
from the pan. Divide into eight equal pieces. To 1/2 gallon water,
add tamari, kombu, ginger, and Seitan steaks.  Cover pot, bring to a
simmer, and cook for about 45 minutes.  (If you are using a pressure
cooker, reduce liquid by one half and cook for 20 to 25 minutes). You
may leave steaks in the stock for several hours, if you wish.  Remove
steaks from stock and drain. Brush with a little sauce, and broil so
they will be lightly browned. Serve steaks hot with additional sauce.

work toward being a participant and finalist in the Culinary Olympics
held in Frankfurt, Germany.
