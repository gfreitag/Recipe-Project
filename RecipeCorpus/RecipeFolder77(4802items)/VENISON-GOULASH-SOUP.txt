Categories: Soups, Game
Yield: 12 Servings
5 1/2 lb Lean venison, cut into 1
-1/4-inch cubes
5 oz Lard
5 1/2 lb Onions, sliced
5 oz Sweet paprika
1 tb Hot paprika
1 1/4 qt Red wine
3 1/8 qt Water
2 lg Potatoes, peeled and

3    Carrots, peeled and
-quartered
2    Apples, peeled, cored and
-quartered
Peppercorns
Juniper berries
3    Bay leaves
A few "Piment" seeds (??)
3    Stalks celery, thinly sliced
2 bn Parsley, chopped
Sour cream to taste
Best made in large quantities.  Recipe therefor serves 12.

In a large pot, melt some of the lard and brown the meat in batches.
Add more lard as required.  Remove the meat and reserve. Fry onions
until browned. Remove onions from pot and reserve. Add remaining
lard. Add paprika and stir well.  Slowly add red wine and water,
continuing to stir to make sure there are no lumps of paprika. Add
meat and onions to pot again.  Add potatoes, carrots, apples and
spices. Quantities are approximate, use more, or less, as you wish.
Cook gently, covered, for 3 hours.  Check occasionally, and add more
water as required. Remove coarse spices, and add celery and parsley.
Serve with a bowl of sour cream, so each person can help themselves.

NOTE:  This recipe does not mention salt, or pepper, which in my
opinion ought to be included.
