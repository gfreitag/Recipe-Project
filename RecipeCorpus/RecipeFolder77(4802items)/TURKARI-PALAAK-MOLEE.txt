1 pk Frozen chopped spinach
Heat oil in heavy pan.  Add onions and fry until golden brown. Add
garlic, ginger and all spices except salt. Fry for 5 minutes until
fragrant. If mixture is too dry add a little water.  Stir regularly
to prevent burning. Add lamb and toss through to coat with
onion/spices. Fry further 10 minutes, stirring to prevent
burning/sticking. Add thawed spinach and mix thoroughly.  Add coconut
cream and salt.  Stir well. Add curry leaves, bring to a rapid boil.
Reduce heat and allow to simmer for at least 1.5 hours covered.
Remove lid and simmer till sauce reduces, usually 15-30 minutes.
This is an exceptionally hot curry, if you prefer a milder curry
reduce by half the following ingredients: chilli powder and hot
paprika.

This recipe also lends itself to substituting chicken for the lamb.
