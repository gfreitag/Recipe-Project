Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 9-in flans
-JUDI M. PHELPS
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  ;water
6 lg Eggs
6 lg Egg yolks
2 tb Vanilla extract
2 c  Whipping cream
2 1/2 c  Milk*
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Fresh raspberries
*Do not use low-fat or nonfat milk.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Combine 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup
water in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over low heat until sugar
dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until sugar
caramelizes, occasionally swirling pan and brushing sides with wet
pastry brush. Immediately pour caramel into two 9-inch glass pie
dishes (4-cup capacity each), dividing as evenly as possible.
Carefully turn dishes to coat bottoms and sides.

Whisk eggs, egg yolks and vanilla extract in large bowl to blend. Add
whipping cream, milk, and 1-1/2 cups sugar and stir gently until sugar
dissolves. Divide custard between caramel-lined dishes. Place in heavy
large baking pan.  Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up
sides of dishes.  Bake until knife inserted into center of custards
comes out clean, about 55 minutes.  Remove custards from water and
cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead).

Turn casserole out onto platter.  Sprinkle with raspberries and serve.
