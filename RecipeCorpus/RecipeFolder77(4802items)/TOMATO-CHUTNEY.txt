Remove the chilies from the vinegar (after soaking 2 hours),
retaining this for later use. Grind the soaked chilies with the
ginger and garlic in a blender. Now put the vinegar, sugar and salt
in a large pan and bring to a boil. At this point, add the tomatoes,
dates and the teaspoon of the spice powder. Stir them round and then
simmer on a moderate heat until the mixture becomes very thick and
has the consistency you like for chutney. Remove the pan from the
heat, allow to cool a little and then spoon the chutney into warmed
jars. Cover and once opened, store in the refrigerator for up to 6
weeks.
