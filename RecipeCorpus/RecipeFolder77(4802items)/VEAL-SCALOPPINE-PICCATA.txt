Warm a serving dish in low oven or microwave. Spread flour in a plate
and lightly dip both sides of scallops in it, shaking off excess.
Meanwhile, in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, warm 2
tablespoons of the butter with the oil until very hot and fragrant.
Add scallops (you may have to work in several batches to keep them
uncrowded) and brown lightly on both sides (about 1 minute per side).
Remove immediately to warmed serving dish, sprinkle with salt and
pepper, and tent with foil to keep warm.

2. Pour oil out of skillet. With pan off heat add lemon juice,
scraping up browned bits. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter plus
capers and 1 tablespoon of parsley. Return veal to sauce and warm
briefly over medium heat, turning veal in sauce to coat. Return veal
and sauce to serving platter, garnish with remaining 1 tablespoon
parsley and lemon slices (if desired). Serve immediately.
