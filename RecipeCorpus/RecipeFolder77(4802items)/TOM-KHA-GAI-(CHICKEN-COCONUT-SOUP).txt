; lower third portion only,

1/2 c  Lime juice
1 ts Black chili paste
1/4 c  Cilantro/coriander leaves
; torn
5    Green Thai chili peppers,
; crushed
A rich, aromatic dinner soup, which is enjoyed throughout the meal.
Whenever possible, fresh kaffir lime leaves should be used, and their
flavor and aroma is increased when they are torn instead of cut with a
knife.  Young galangal is pale yellow, with firm unwrinkled pink
shoots. Fresh young ginger can be substituted if necessary, but the
flavor will not be quite the same.

Combine half the coconut milk with the galangal, lemon grass and lime
leaves in a large saucepan and heat to boiling. Add the chicken, fish
sauce and sugar.

Simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked . Add the
remaining coconut milk to the saucepan and heat just to boiling.

Place the lime juice and chili past in a serving bowl, then pour the
soup into the serving bowl.

Garnish with the torn cilantro leaves and crushed chili peppers, and
serve.
