Title: TURKEY SAUSAGE 2
Categories: Turkey, Ground turk, Italian, Pies & past, Light
1/4 c  Brandy
Yield: 1 Servings
1 TB Chopped fresh thyme -- -OR-
1 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/4 c  Finely minced onion
1/2 ts Ground white pepper
1/2 ts Salt
4 oz Bacon
1 1/2 lb Ground turkey -- see NOTE
6    Egg whites
2    Feet sausage casings

NOTE: For this sausage, the turkey should be 2 parts dark meat to 1
part white meat. Ground turkey from the supermarket works well in
this recipe. COMBINE BRANDY, THYME, CLOVES, onion, pepper and salt in
a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook 3 minutes, then
scrape into the bowl of a food processor. Add the bacon and puree
until smooth. Place the mixture in a mixing bowl, add the ground
turkey and egg whites and mix well. Stuff the mixture into casings or
form into patties. Grill or cook sausages and serve immediately.
