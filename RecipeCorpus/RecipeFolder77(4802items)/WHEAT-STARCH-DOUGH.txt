Title: WHEAT STARCH DOUGH
Categories: China
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Wheat starch
2/3 c  Tapioca starch
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Oil
1 c  Boiling water + 2 Tbsp.
TO MAKE DOUGH: Mix well the first 4 ingredients in order given. Bring
water to a rolling boil and stir into dry ingredients with chopsticks
until dry ingredients adhere. Cover and let it cool for 15 minutes.
Lightly oil kneading surface and knead dough for several minutes,
until dough is well mixed and smooth. Now it is ready for wrapping.
DO-AHEAD NOTES: Dough can be kept at room temperature for 1 day if
you wrap it in plastic wrap. But Ms. Yee usually has fillings ready
for wrapping right away.

COMMENTS: It is very important that the water for the dough be
boiling vigorously for several minutes before mixing with the
starches. One sure way to have just the right amount of water is by
first having a larger quantity than is called for in the recipe.
Bring water to a rolling boil for 5 minutes then measure off the
proper amount, return the water to the emptied pot, bring it to a
vigorous boil again, adding to starch mixture right away. If the
water is cooled off even for just a few seconds. the starch will not
get cooked and the dough will fall apart. (You'll see the dough
taking on a chalky white appearance instead of a transparent look.
This indicates it is properly cooked.) To insure dough is rolled
evenly, a tortilla press will work wonders! (See recipes for Ha Gow
and Steamed Pork Turnovers). Yield: 3-4 doz. wrappers.
