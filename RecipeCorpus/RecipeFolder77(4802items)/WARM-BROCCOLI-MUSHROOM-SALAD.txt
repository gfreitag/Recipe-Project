Nathalie Dupree Loves Fresh Mushrooms For Quick Meals

Nathalie Dupree's new cookbook "Nathalie Dupree Cooks Quick Meals For
Busy Days" (Clarkson Potter,February, 1996), is filled with simple
yet elegant "rush hour" recipes and time-savings tips.

To clean mushrooms: Put mushrooms in a plastic bag with two
tablespoons of flour or baking soda, fill the bag 3/4 full of cold
water, then quickly shake and drain. The mushrooms come out free of
soil and need only to be patted dry with a towel.
