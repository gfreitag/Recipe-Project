COMMENTS:Bake in miniature size and use as an hors d'oeuvre, suggests
the owner of this recipe, who uses muffin pans for his favorite dish
for a December family reunion. To accompany the mini-tourti=8Ares, he
likes home-made tomato-and-peach ketchup and dry red wine. TIP: Add a
pinch or two more herbes and spices. Heat oil in a large, heavy
frying pan and saut=82 ground pork, veal and beef, breaking up meat
until crumbly. Add garlic and onions, and saut=82 until vegetables
are soft. Add beef broth, sage, ba= y leaf, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves,
parsley flakes, dry celery leaves and celery seeds. Cover and simmer
for 20 to 30 minutes. Add brandy and breadcrumbs. Blend in salt and
pepper. Simmer briefly. Mixture should be moist. Cool. Preheat oven
to 425'F.. Line 3 9-inch pie pans with pastry, reserving an equal
amount of the dough for top crusts. Fill each pan with meat mixture.
Cover with pastry, cutting two slits in the center of each pie to
permit steam to escape. Brush each pie with beaten egg. Bake
tourti=8Ares for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350'F. and cook until
crust is golden-brown, about 25 minutes. Serve hot or cool
completely, wrap and freeze. Makes 3 tourti=8Ares. From the MOTREAL
GAZETTE, DECEMBER 5 1984.
