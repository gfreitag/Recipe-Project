1 c  Water ; (i use bottled h20)

I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat
bread recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just
halved your recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour
model, is yours? If I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add
more flour because it doesn't rise as much.  Also, whenever I use
whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid
elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I put in the DAK and the
order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the
menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one) Later, at the
beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have walnuts on hand). I usually
add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while knead
ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me know if you try it
and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or
any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to
see what it would do in it.  Thanks so much for taking precious time
to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give
you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!.
