Title: TOFU (5)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-====
Soak 2 cups of dried soybeans overnight, then drain & rinse them, and
combine them with an equal volume of water a cup or two at a time in a
blender, and whiz them until smooth (about 3 minutes.)

This batch of puree is then poured into a pot which has 8 cups of
water brought to a boil, and is returned to a boil and then reduced
to medium heat, and cooked & stirred until "the foam rises". Then,
the liquid is poured through a clothlined colander, and the excess
liquid is squeezed from the cloth, and the stuff in the cloth (called
okara), is saved for another interesting experiment someday (more on
that later), and the milk is put back in the boiling pot, and brought
back to a boil & cooked for another 5 minutes.

This netted me a little over 1/2 gallon of soy milk (actually 1/2
gal. plus a large [16 oz.] drinking glass), which I promptly
refrigerated. Please note: if I had been following the complete tofu
recipe, I would have added the solidifier at this point (1 teaspoon
of nigari dissolved in 1 cup of water), but I have neither nigari nor
tofu pressing containers or supplies, but maybe next time...
