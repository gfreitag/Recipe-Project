Title: TURKEY TASSO
Categories: Cajun, Poultry, Low-cal
Yield: 15 Servings
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Onion powder
2 tb Ground black pepper
1 tb Ground white pepper
1 tb Ground cumin
2 tb Liquid smoke
2 tb Granulated garlic
2 tb Ground red pepper
2 tb Paprika
2 ts Salt
3 lb Skinned & boned turkey brea
In a small bowl, combine the sugar, garlic, onion powder, red, white,
and black peppers, paprika, salt and cumin, mixing well. Place the
turkey breast in a large glass bowl and sprinkle with 4 Tbsp of the
mixture, coating well.  (store the remainder of the seasoning mix the
a tight container for future use)

Sprinkle the turkey with the liquid smoke, rubbing the seasoning mix
and liquid over the entire breast. Cover the bowl and marinate for
two(2) days in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.

Light the fire in a charcoal water smoker, cover, and let the heat and
smoke accumulate.  When the smoker is ready, place the turkey breast
on the wire rack and smoke for 7 hours. Add water as needed. Add a
few mesquite chips every hour or so.  When the tasso is done, remove
and set aside until cool enough to handle. You will note it is very
dry, almost like jerky. Don't worry, that's normal.  Store it in
freezer bags up to one month in the refrigerator or six months in the
freezer.

note: This is not something you will really want to make a sandwich
from. It is used primarily in gumbo, red beans, stuffings and some
pasta dishes.
It has a very pronounced flavor.  Basically, it can be used in place
of smoked ham hocks or the like.  I like it by itself, but then I've
been accused of having no taste buds left in my mouth because of the
hot food I love to consume.
