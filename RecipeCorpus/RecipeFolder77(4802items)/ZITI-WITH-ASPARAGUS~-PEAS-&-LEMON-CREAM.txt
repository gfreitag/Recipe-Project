Place the peas in a vegetable steamer, set over simmering water, and
steam, covered, for 3-5 minutes or until just tender. Remove and run

Add the asparagus to the vegetable steamer. Cover and steam for 3-5
minutes or until just tender. Remove and run under cold water to stop
further cooking. Drain and set aside.

Add asparagus to the vegetable steamer. Cover and steam for 3-5
minutes or until just tender. Run under cold water, drain and reserve.

In a large heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and whisk
in the cream. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until
reduced by one-third. Add the lemon juice and rind. Season with salt
and white pepper and keep warm.

Bring plenty of salted water to a boil in a large casserole. Add the
ziti and cook until just tender, al dente. Add 2 cups of cold water
to stop further cooking. Drain thoroughly, and add to the lemon cream
together with the peas, asparagus and Bibb lettuce and simmer until
the sauce lightly coats the pasta and the lettuce has just wilted.
Add the Parmesan and toss gently. Taste and correct the seasoning and
serve at once.
