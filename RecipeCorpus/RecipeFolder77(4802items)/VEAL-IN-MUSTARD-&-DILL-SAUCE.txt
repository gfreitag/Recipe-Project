Trim the veal into neat even pieces. Peel and chop the onion quite
finely. Heat the butter and oil in a flameproof casserole and cook
the onion until golden. Toss the veal in seasoned flour and add to
the onion. Cook until lightly browned, stirring, then add the heated
stock. Stir until blended. Remove enough leaves from the sprigs of
dill to give 2 tbsp when chopped. Set aside the leaves. Add the
sprigs, salt, pepper, and mustard to the casserole and cover. Simmer
gently for 1 1/4 hours or until the veal is tender.

Lift out the dill sprigs and throw away. Add the cream, stir until
blended, then add the chopped dill and stand for a few moments before
serving. Serve with new potatoes or rice and a green salad.
