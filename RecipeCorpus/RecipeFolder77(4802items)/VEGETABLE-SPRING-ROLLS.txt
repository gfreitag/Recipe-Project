Title: VEGETABLE SPRING ROLLS
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian, Vietnamese
Yield: 10 Servings
1 oz Cellophane noodles
- soaked in warm water for
- 20 min, drained and
- chopped fine
2    Squares bean curd
- finely chopped
3 sm Potatoes; peeled and
- cut paper thin with a
- peeler and then shredded
1 tb Tree ears; soaked in
- warm water 20 min,
- drained and chopped
1 c  Bean sprouts
1 md Carrot; peeled paper thin,
- cut into 1 inch sections
- and shredded
1    White part of leek; chopped
1 ds Black pepper
10    Dried rice papers
- (banh trang)
2 c  Peanut oil
~- Combine all ingredients except rice papers and oil. Cut the rice
papers into quarters.  Wet the surface of each paper with water (use
your fingers or a brush) and within about 1 min the paper will become
flexible enough to be filled.  Place about 1 tbsp of the filling on
each paper and roll. Heat the oil in a wok to about 350 deg. F. Place
rolls, flaps-down, into oil and cook 20 min (10 min each side), until
completely done.
Serve with Buddhist Nuoc Leo. ~- Disclaimer: This recipe is fat-city.
There is another form of spring roll skin which is inherently sticky
and stretchy (white and barely opaque), and doesn't require deep
frying. (One could lighly saute the carrots and potatoes beforehand.)
I can't remember what this wrapper is called.  BTW - With this
alternate type of "spring roll" fresh chinese parsley or cilantro is
often included. ~- Side note: About forming a spring roll from
quartered rice paper...
