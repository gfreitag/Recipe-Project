* Can be made from fresh or dried coconut or purchased bottled. Do
not use the canned coconut mix for mixed drinks as it is very sweet
and different. If using fresh coconut, cut coconut meat into 1"
pieces & place equal amounts of coconut & hot water in food processor
or blender. Puree at high speed for a couple of minutes, let steep
for 30 minutes. Then pour into a strainer set over a bowl. Press on
the pulp and squeeze by the handful to extract as milk as possible.
Pour the milk through a fine-mesh strainer. For dried coconut: use 1
cup unsweetened, dried coconut with 1 1/2 c hot tap water. Allow to
stand for 5 minutes. Puree one minute and proceed as above. Will keep
up to three days refrigerated and indefinitely, if frozen.
