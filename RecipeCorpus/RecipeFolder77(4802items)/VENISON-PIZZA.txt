Title: VENISON PIZZA
Categories: Wild game
Yield: 7 Servings
1 lb Ground venison
6 c  Unbleached flour
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
4 tb Butter or margarine
4 tb Honey
1/2 ts Salt
1    Package of yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
3 c  Grated cheese
1 sm Onion, chopped
2 cn Pizza sauce
Chives (optional)

First, measure flour into large bowl.  In a separate container combine
buttermilk, butter, honey and salt. Heat the buttermilk mixture to
lukewarm.  Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add yeast and milk mixture to
flour and combine to make a firm dough.  Turn dough out and kneed for
about 6 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Put the dough in
a greased bowl, cover and let rise until double in bulk, about 1
hour. While dough is rising, prepare the toppings.  Grate plenty of
cheese. Chop some onions and some wild chive if you have some handy.
Fry venison, crumbling it as you fry.  When dough has risen, punch it
down, divide it in half, and roll out the two parts to fit your
baking sheets. The dough should be about 1/4-inch thick.  Let the
rolled out dough rise for about 15 minutes. Spread a generous amount
of pizza sauce on the dough. Sprinkle on plenty of oregano, garlic
powder, pepper and a little thyme. Top with grated cheese and the
crumbled venison.  Bake at 350F for 20 to 30 minutes.
