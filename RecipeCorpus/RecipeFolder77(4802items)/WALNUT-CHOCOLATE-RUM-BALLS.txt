Title: WALNUT CHOCOLATE RUM BALLS
Categories: Desserts, Nuts, Candies
Yield: 1 Lot
1 c  Walnuts, ground or
- finely chopped
2 c  Grated "German's sweet" or
- bittersweet chocolate
1 1/2 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
4 tb Rum
Cocoa powder
Combine nuts, sugar, and chocolate. Moisten with rum to form a stiff
dough. Form into small balls and roll in cocoa to coat. This recipe
is not only simple, it's flexible. It can be made with other kinds of
liquor (amaretto, sherry, and Southern Comfort work well), nuts
(almonds or pecans, for instance) and coatings (ground nuts, finely
grated coconut, etc.) and always comes out tasting great. Adding
small chunks of nut for texture is also effective.
