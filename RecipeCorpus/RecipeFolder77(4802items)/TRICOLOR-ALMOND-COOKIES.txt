Categories: Cookies, Dessert, Posted-mm, Suzy, Untried
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Sugar
12 1/2 oz Can almond filling
4 lg Eggs, separated
2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
Food coloring - RED & GREEN
Seedless raspberry jam
- Apricot preserves
1 1/2 c  Chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour three 8x11-inch pans.

Cream the butter and sugar. Mix in almond filling. Add egg yolks, then
flour and baking powders gradually, and mix well.

In separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff and fold them into
batter. Separate batter into 3 equal parts. Tint one part red, one
part green and leave one as is.

Spread each color into a separate baking pan and bake for 8-10
minutes or until cake springs back to the touch. Let cool in pans.
Spread red layer with jam (remain in pan). Remove next layer and
place on top of red layer and spread with preserves. Place third
layer on top of second layer. Cover with plastic wrap.

Place cake in refrigerator overnight, weighted down evenly with a
cutting board or plates and heavy cans, etc.

Following day melt 1 cup of chocolate chips over hot water. Spread on
top and sides of cake. Return cake to the refrigerator until
chocolate hardens. Remove and flip cake over so chocolate coating is
on bottom. Melt the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, frost top
of cake. Return to fridge until chocolate hardens. Cut into pieces.
These cookies freeze well.
