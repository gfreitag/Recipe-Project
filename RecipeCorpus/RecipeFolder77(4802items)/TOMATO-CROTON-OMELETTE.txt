Title: TOMATO CROTON OMELETTE
Categories: Eggs, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
4    Eggs
3 tb Milk
2    Tomatoes, skinned
- and sliced
A few chopped chives
3 tb Crotons
Salt and pepper
Parmesan to garnish
Blissful summer food. Use tomatoes that are as fresh as possible for
the best results here. The crunch of crotons in the filling is
utterly mouth-watering, and gives this omelette a distinction quite
its own.

Beat the eggs with the milk and season with salt and pepper. Lightly
grease a heavy frying-pan and pour in the mixture. (If you do not
have a pan large enough, make two omelettes separately.) As it begins
to set, place the sliced tomatoes on top and sprinkle with the
chives. Season with salt and pepper and finally toss in the crotons.
Fold the omelette in half and serve as soon as possible, sprinkled
with a little grated Parmesan.
