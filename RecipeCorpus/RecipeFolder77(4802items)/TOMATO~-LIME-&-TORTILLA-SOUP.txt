Categories: Soups, Mexican, Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Onions, chopped
4 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
3 tb Vegetable oil

1 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Oregano
3 1/2 c  Tomatoes, chopped

In a soup pot, saute onions & garlic in oil until softened. Add the
chiles, cumin & oregano & saute a few more minutes. Add tomatoes &
sprinkle with a little salt.  Cover the pot & cook gently until the
tomatoes begin to release their juices.  Stir occasionally. Add stock

seasoning.

Serve topped with crumbled tortilla chips (I find that these are not
necessary) & garnish with cilantro.
