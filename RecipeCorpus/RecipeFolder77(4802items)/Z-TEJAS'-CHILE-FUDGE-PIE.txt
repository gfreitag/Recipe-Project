Title: Z TEJAS' CHILE FUDGE PIE
Categories: Desserts, Jaw, Copycat, Pies
Yield: 1 Depends
2 ts Ancho puree*
1/2 lb Butter
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
2    Eggs
1/2 c  White sugar
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Flour
1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
9 inch unbaked pie shell
*For ancho puree: Ancho chiles, which are dried poblanos, are dark
brown peppers found in the produce section. Remove seeds and stem
from one ancho chile pepper. Place ancho in a small saucepan with
water to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until ancho is tender.
Puree in a food processor.

Melt butter and let cool to warm. Toast pecans and walnuts until
lightly brown. Beat eggs well and then add sugars and flour. Beat
until smooth. Add warm butter and mix well. (It is important for
butter to be warm so chocolate chips will melt some.) Add chile
puree. Stir in nuts and chocolate chips. Pour filling into pastry
shell and bake at 325 degrees for 45 to 60 minutes until done.
