Title: WEDNESDAY'S HOT & JUICY HAMBURGERS
Categories: Meats, Cyberealm, Kooknet
Yield: 15 Patties
5 lb Lean ground beef
3 1/2 oz Baby food strained veal
3 1/2 oz Baby food strained beef
10 1/2 oz Campbell's beef broth
1 ts Onion salt
1 ts Seasoned salt
1/2 ts Lemon pepper
1/2 ts Finely crushed dry minced
-onions (use a hammer to
-flatten them)
2 tb Cup of Soup Tomato Flavor
-Soup Powder
Mix all of the ingredients together thoroughly, covering your hands
with plastic food bags to knead it well. Or dig right in like Grandma
did, remember that fingers were made before forks! Shape into patties
by measuring out 2/3's cupful of mixture for each & keeping them
about 1/2" thick & square in shape, about the size of a Graham
cracker. The mixture makes about 15 patties, which can be
individually wrapped and frozen, to be thawed about 30 minutes at
room temperature or more quickly on "defrost" in the microwave oven
per manufacturer's directions. They freeze well up to 6 months.  Do
not refrigerate for more than 2 days.

Wednesday's as in Wendy's
