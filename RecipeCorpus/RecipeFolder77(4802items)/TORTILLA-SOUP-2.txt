Categories: Soups
Yield: 12 Servings
3 lb Chicken pieces
16 c  Water
1 ts Celery seed
1 ts Black peppercorns
2    Garlic cloves, peeled
1 lb Tomatoes (canned),
-whole, peeled (do not
-drain; reserve the liquid)
1    Onion, cut into
-1/2-inch pieces
1    Green pepper, cut into
-1/2-inch pieces
3    Sprigs fresh cilantro
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
1/4 ts Cayenne or chili powder
1/4 ts Ground white pepper
1    Garlic clove, minced
10 oz Corn, frozen
4    Green onions,
-coarsely chopped
Salt
1 c  Rice, cooked (cook about
-3 oz of raw rice to get
-that much cooked rice)
2 ts Parsley, minced
4 oz Tortilla chips
1/2 lb Cheddar cheese, grated
Combine chicken and water in stockpot.  Add celery seed, peppercorns
and garlic tied in cheesecloth. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat
and simmer for about 45 minutes. Remove chicken from broth and let
cool.

Strain broth and return to pot.  Add tomatoes, onion, green pepper,
cilantro, cumin, cayenne, white pepper and garlic. Cover and simmer 30
minutes.

Add corn and green onion.  Simmer 10 minutes.  While this is cooking,
skin and bone the chicken pieces and cut the meat into bite-size
pieces. Add salt to taste. Add the chicken, rice and parsley to the
broth, and heat through.

Garnish each bowl with a few crisp tortilla chips (homemade are best,
or those made in a homemade style) and some grated cheddar cheese.

NOTES:

*  A spicy soup with cheese, tomatoes and corn -- This is a recipe
from Salmagundi, a San Francisco soup restaurant chain.

*  I usually make this with leftover chicken.  You don't actually
need a whole chicken worth, even a small amount will do. In this
case, I use a mixture of chicken broth and water (about 2/3 chicken
broth) for the liquid.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  2 hours, most of it simmering.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
