Title: TYROPITES
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 60 Servings
1/2 lb Ricotta or cream cheese
1/2 lb Feta cheese; crumbled
2    Eggs; lightly beaten
1 tb All-purpose flour
1 pn Salt (optional)
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg (or more)
1 c  Butter; melted
3 tb Butter; melted
1 lb Commercial filo sheets
In a bowl combine the cheeses, eggs, flour, salt (unless the feta is
very salty) nutmeg, and 3 tablespoons butter. Cover the bowl and
chill several hours or overnight, removing from the refrigerator an
hour before using. Cut the filo into thirds (3 x 11 inches). Pile up
the filo, covering it with waxed paper and a damp towel. Take out one
sheet at a time and keep the rest covered.  Butter the filo, one
sheet at a time, using a pastry brush and the 1 cup melted butter.
Place 1 teaspoon of the filling 1 inch from the end nearest you. Fold
the filo back over the filling so the bottom edge meets the left
edge, forming a right angle. Continue folding back at right angles to
make the triangular shape. Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for
20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp, turning once. Serve hot.
Note: Tyropites may be stacked upright in cardboard boxes and frozen.
When ready to bake, separate while still frozen, spread on baking
sheets, and bake as directed above, allowing an additional 10 minutes
baking time. Diagram For Folding Tyropites Or Spanakopites __________
