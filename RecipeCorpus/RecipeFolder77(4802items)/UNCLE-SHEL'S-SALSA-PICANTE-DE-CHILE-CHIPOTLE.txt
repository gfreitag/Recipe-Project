clove garlic, smashed and quartered Place the chiles and their seeds
in a small blender jar, add the garlic and the black pepper. Mix the
vinegar and the water together and heat until the mixture is just
ready to boil, and add it to the peppers. Tightly close the jar and
let the ingredients steep for at least 1/2 an hour.  Then puree until
smooth. This makes a tangy, tasty and thick salsa.  The rice vinegar
makes a somewhat mellower salsa than the cider vinegar. You could
also use a distilled vinegar, or play around with the proportions of
vinegar and water to achieve your own pucker level.
