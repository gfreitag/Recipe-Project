Place the eggplant slices on an oiled baking sheet, salt them
lightly, and cover them with aluminum foil. Bake at 400-F. until
tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Lower oven to 350. Meanwhile, saute the
onions in the oil until translucent. Add the mushrooms and continue
to cook,covered, on medium heat until the mushrooms have released
their juices and become soft. Stir in the tomatoes, marjoram, thyme,
paprika, salt and black pepper.Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove
from the heat and drain off most of the juice. Set aside. Combine the
rice, lemon juice, parsley, and pine nuts. To assemble the casserole,
oil a 9x13x2 1/2-inch baking dish. Spread half the rice mixture on
the bottom and cover with half the eggplant slices. Spoon half the
sauteed vegetables on top of the eggplant layer. Repeat this process
using the remaining rice, eggplant, and vegetables. Pour the eggs
evenly over the top of the casserole so that they drizzle down into
it. Combine the breadcrumbs and nuts and saute them on low heat in
the oil or butter for about 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Top the
casserole with the nut mixture and bake it, covered, at 350, for
about 30 minutes. Then uncover and bake for 10 minutes until the top
is crisp and the casserole still moist. Garnish with parsley and
peppers. From Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant By The Moosewood
