Categories: Stews, Cyberealm, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Oil
2 tb Unbleached white flour
1/2    Onion (chopped)
2    Ribs celery and tops
(coarsley chopped)
1    Pod garlic (quartered)
3 1/2    Quarts water
1    Carcass from a 12 lb.

1/2 c  Cooked steamed rice
1 c  Turkey meat (chopped)
1 ts Fresh parsley
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
In a large, 8 quart pot, mix oil and flour. Heat over a medium flame
to make a roux. Tilt pot occasionally and stir continuously until
mixture becomes light brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion, celery, and
garlic. Lower heat slightly and saute about 10 minutes, until tender.
Add 3 quarts water and turkey carcass. Bring to a boil, lower heat,
let simmer uncovered for 3-1/2 hours. Stir occasionally. If
necessary, add more hot water. Cook rice and set aside. When soup is
done, pour liquid, through a strainer, into a bowl. Let liquid cool.
Reserve meat from carcass (about 1-1/2 cups meat) and add the 1 cup
of turkey meat. Chop meat into small pieces. Discard carcass and
seasonings. Store liquid in refrigerator for 2 hours until fat rises
to the top. (See part 2 for more.)
