Peel and dice turnips.  Melt the butter (or use olive oil) in a large
skillet; add turnips, cover and cook over medium heat for about 10-12
minutes, or until they begin to color--changing from white to a light
yellow.  Set them aside. Bring the consomme to a simmer in a medium
saucepan.  Add the turnips and a pinch of sugar. Simmer, skimming if
necessary, until the turnips are cooked and soft when piered with a
fork, about 10 to 15 minutes. If the peas are frozen, pour boiling
hot water over them and let stand for 3 minutes. Drain. If the peas
are fresh, blanch in boiling water until bright green, about 1
minute. Drain. Place the peas and croutons in a warmed soup tureen
and cover with the hot turnip soup. Serve immediately in heated
individual soup bowls.
