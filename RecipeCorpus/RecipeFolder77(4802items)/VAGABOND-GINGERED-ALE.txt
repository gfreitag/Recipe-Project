Title: VAGABOND GINGERED ALE
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 5 Servings
3 1/2 lb Munton & Fison plain dark
Malt extract syrup
2 1/2 lb Plain dk. dried malt extract
3/4 lb Crystal malt
1/2 lb Chocolate malt
2 oz Cascade hops (boiling)
Equal to 10 HBU
1 oz Willamette hops (finishing)
3 oz Freshly grated ginger root
(2-4 oz to taste)
1 pk Ale yeast
3/4 c  Corn sugar (for bottling)
*** OR ***
1 1/4 c  Dried malt extract
O.G.: 1.040-1.044 T.G.: 1.012-1.016

Add the crushed crystal and chocolate malts to 1 1/2 gallons of cold
water and bring to a boil.  When boiling has commenced, remove the
grains and add the malt extracts. (Do not allow the grains to remain
in boiling water, as this will add an "ashy" taste). Dissolve the
extracts fully and add the boiling hops and freshly grated ginger
root and continue to boil for 60 minutes.  Add the finishing hops
during the final 1-2 minutes of the boil. Sparge into the fermenter
and cold water. Force cool, pitch yeast, and bottle when fermentation
is complete.
