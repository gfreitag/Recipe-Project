Title: TOMATO & VEGETABLE JUICE BLEND
Categories: Beverages, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 22 pounds of tomatoes is needed per canner
load of 7 quarts. Not more than 3 cups of other vegetables may be
added for each 22 pounds of tomatoes.

Procedure: Crush and simmer tomatoes as for making tomato juice. Add
no more than 3 cups of any combination of finely chopped celery,
onions, carrots, and peppers for each 22 pounds of tomatoes. Simmer
mixture 20 minutes. Press hot cooked tomatoes and vegetables through
a sieve or food mill to remove skins and seeds. Add bottled lemon
juice or citric acid to jars (See acidification directions). Add 1
teaspoon of salt per quart to the jars, if desired. Reheat
tomato-vegetable juice blend to boiling and fill immediately into
jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process.
Recommended process times are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

following section of the guide appears to contain some sort of error
in the information given within Table 2 (below). In the USDA book,
there are only TWO sizes of jars specified in the table, but there
are THREE separate lines of figures in the table, and it is not
completely clear which jar size the second and third entries refer
to. I have given the third entry's numbers as those to be used for
Quart jars, and I have reprinted the second entry on the table
separately, for an unknown jar size.
