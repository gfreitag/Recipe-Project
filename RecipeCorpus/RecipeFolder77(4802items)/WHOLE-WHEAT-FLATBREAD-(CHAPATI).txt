Title: WHOLE WHEAT FLATBREAD (CHAPATI)
Categories: Breads, Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 14 Servings
2 1/4 c  Durum flour
1/2 ts Sea salt
1 tb Canola oil
2/3 c  -Very warm water
Combine flours and salt in a large mixing bowl.

Mix in oil and water to form a stiff dough, adding more water if
necessary. Remove dough from bowl and knead on a lightly floured
surface until smooth, about
5    minutes.

Return dough to bowl, cover with a towel and set aside in a warm
place for one hour.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 14 equal
portions.  Roll each piece into a ball and cover with a damp towel.

Heat an ungreased griddle or large frying pan over medium heat.
Working with one ball of dough at a time, flatten it, then roll into
a 6" circle, using only enough flour to keep dough from sticking.
When griddle is hot, pick up dough, shake off excess flour and place
it on a hot pan. Cook until brown spots appear, about one minute.
Flip dough over and cook on other side.  (Chapati may puff up while
cooking.)

Cover and place in a warm oven while cooking remaining chapatis.
