Put pulp in a saucepan with salt, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon sugar and
simmer until soft.  Press through a sieve and reserve pulp.

Gently fry onion in half of the oil until transparent. Add pine nuts
(if used) and cook for further 5 minutes. Stir in rice, currants, hot
water, parsley, mint and season to taste. Bring to the boil, cover
and simmer gently for 10 minutes until liquid is absorbed.

Fill tomatoes, allowing room for rice to swell. Replace tops and

Pour pureed tomato pulp and equal quantity of water or white wine into
dish.  Spoon remaining oil over tomatoes and cook, uncovered, in a
moderate oven for
30    minutes.  Serve hot or cold.

accompaniament to main meals.
