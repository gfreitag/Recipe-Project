This could be called a heavy fruitcake. Boil sugar, shortening,
raisins, dates, salt and spices for 3 min. Remove from heat and let
cool. When cool, add flour and baking soda that have veen sifted
together; beat well. Pour into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan and bake
at 350 degrees for 45 min.

This was a VERY popular recipe at the Oakland Navy yard during the
era. And what I find amusing...it is a good recipe to make for
camping trips today. There isn't much in it to spoil. You could even
make this on your upcoming camping trip!
