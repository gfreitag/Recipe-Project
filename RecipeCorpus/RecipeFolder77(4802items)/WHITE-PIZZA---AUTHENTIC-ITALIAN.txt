Dissolve yeast in the warm water.  Add yeast/water mixture to 3 cups
of the flour.   Mix, adding regular salt and olive oil a little at a
time. Add the rest of the flour bit by bit until the dough "feels
right".

Turn dough onto a floured board and knead; adding more flour if
necessary to keep  the dough from sticking to your fingers. Put the
dough in a greased bowl and rotate to distribute the grease all over
the dough. Let rise until about double  in size (approx. 2 hours).

Remove the dough, punch down and roll out on the floured board to a
thickness of  3/8 to 1/2 inch (make it any shape you desire). Put
dough in a pan or cookie sheet. With a pastry brush, paint liberally
with additional olive oil.  Use your  thumb and 2 fingers to make
dimples over the entire surface. Sprinkle the Kosher sea salt and
rosemary over the surface of the dough.  Let rise a little more.

Bake at 375 degrees F for about 25 minutes.  When done, paint
liberally again with olive oil.

Makes 1 white pizza.
