Sylvia's comments: this was a desperation recipe I concocted this
morning (as in "I don't have time to seriously season this chicken,
what can I pour on it FAST?") that came out absolutely delicious. The
kids inhaled it and I've been nibbling in between refilling their
plates. It's almost like the Hunter's Chicken I've been trying to
duplicate. There was lots of sauce in the pot, which would be great
to defat and serve over rice or macaroni.
