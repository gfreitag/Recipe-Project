Title: TOMATO SWEET PEPPER KETCHUP
Categories: Sauces, Low-fat
Yield: 10 Servings
2 tb Water or vegetable stock
5    Cloves of garlic, minced
1/2    Red onion, minced
1/4 ts Dried oregano,
2 lb Fresh or canned tomatoes,
Peeled, seeded and chopped
2 tb (2-3 tb) balsamic vinegar
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 ts Salt
Pinch of ground cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves
Pinch of ground allspice
In a large saucepan, put the water or stock, garlic, onion, and
oregano. Cook for 2-3 minutes.  Be careful not to burn the garlic.
Add the remaining ingredients and cook over medium-low heat for 20-30
minutes until thickened. Place all ingredients in a food processor
and process until smooth. To thicken further, return to a pot and
cook over medium-low heat for 10 more minutes, or until reduced to
desired thickness. Take care that the ketchup does not scorch on the
bottom of the pan. This will keep well for 2 weeks in the
refrigerator or longer frozen.
