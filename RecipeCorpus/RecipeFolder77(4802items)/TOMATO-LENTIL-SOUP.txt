Title: TOMATO LENTIL SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
15 oz Tomato sauce
11 oz Tomato paste
4 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Cooked lentils or split peas
1/2 c  Onions, finely chopped
6 sl Bacon; finely chopped
1/4 c  Celery; chopped
1/2 ts Pepper, fresh ground
Salt to taste
1 ts Basil
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Sage
1 c  Whipping cream
1/3 c  Cheddar cheese; grated
3 tb Butter
Melt butter in a large saucepan or small stock pot. Saute chopped
onions, bacon and celery with pepper, basil, thyme, oregano, nutmeg
and sage. When vegetables are softened and bacon cooked add tomato
sauce, tomato paste and chicken stock, stir well to blend. Add
lentils or split yellow peas. Lower heat and simmer for 30 to 45
minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking. Just before serving
adjust spices and add salt to taste. Gently fold in whipping cream
and cheddar cheese.

Tom Bullick said, "Serves six to eight.  As the end of the season
approached and food supplies tightened at the lodge, I modified a
tomato-cheese recipe in the Harrowsmith Cookbook (vol. I), to provide
a real rib-sticking soup. Served with basic bread, it's perfect after
a long, cold, wet day."
