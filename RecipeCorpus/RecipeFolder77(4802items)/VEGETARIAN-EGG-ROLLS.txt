Title: VEGETARIAN EGG ROLLS
Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian
Yield: 12 Servings
1 pk Egg roll wrappers
Or
1    *recipe of cheese blintz pan
Sesame oil
1 c  Celery, finely chopped
1    Onion, small, finely chopped
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 c  Cabbage, finely shredded
1 c  Mushroom, finely chopped
1    Green pepper, finely chopped
1/2 c  Water chestnuts, finely chop
1 c  Sprouts, bean or seed, fresh
1/4 c  Soybeans, dry cooked and
-pureed
3 tb Soy sauce
2 1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
These egg rolls make an excellent first course, or when eaten right
with the cooked rice, a whole meal. Just be sure, if you eat them
without rice, that you include rice in the meal to complement the
soybeans.

In a wok or frying pan saute the vegetables in sesame oil in the order
given.  After the onion has started sauteing, add the remaining
vegetables quickly so that the total time with the heat on is about 5
minutes. As soon as you add the bean sprouts to the pan, turn off the
heat.

Stir the pureed soybeans and soy sauce together.  Then stir this
mixture into the vegetables.

The whole mixture may be chilled several hours, or used warm. To
prepare the rolls: place about 1/4 cup filling in the center of each
pancake or egg roll wrapper; fold the corners over envelope-style and
seal with a flour-water paste.

Heat a large frying pan with oil in the bottom.  Fry the rolls until
they are crisp and brown, turning only once. You may deep fry the
rolls if you are into deep frying, but they are better cooked only in
a little oil. Drain on paper bags or towels.

Keep the rolls hot in a 250~ oven up to an hour.  Or reheat them at
450~ for about 10 minutes.

Serve 2 egg rolls with about 1 cup of cooked rice and any of the
following: mustard, horseradish, soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, or
hot sauce.
