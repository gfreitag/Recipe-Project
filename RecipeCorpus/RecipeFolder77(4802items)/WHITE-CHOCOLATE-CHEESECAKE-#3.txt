Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE #3
Categories: Cakes, Cheesecake, Chocolate
Yield: 8 Servings
12 oz White chocolate
2 c  Pound cake crumbs
1 1/2 lb Cream cheese, softened
1 c  Sugar
2 1/2 ts Vanilla
1 tb Apricot brandy
2 c  Sour cream
Melt white chocolate over low heat in a double boiler.
Set aside to cool slightly.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Distribute
pound cake crumbs evenly over the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
Press crumbs down lightly. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together
cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and apricot brandy with an electric
mixer for at least five minutes or until very smooth.  Add melted
white chocolate and blend another five minutes. Add sour cream and
mix to combine. Pour into crumb lined pan and bake at 350 degrees for
30 minutes. Chill overnight before serving. This cheesecake freezes
very well, and makes about 12-14 slices. It goes well with commercial
fruit sauces or fresh fruit but it is so delicious that it really
doesn't need anything else! It does look nice when it is garnished
with fresh raspberries and mint sprigs though.  This one has been
described as "to die for"!!! From: Karen Henson/Prodigy
