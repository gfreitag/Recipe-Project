Watermelon Fruit Basket

To prepare watermelon basket, cut a thin slice from bottom of the
melon so it will sit flat, being careful not to cut through rind to
melon. With pencil and a 1-1/2 inch wide cardboard guide, draw
scallop design about 1/3 of the way down from the top of the melon.
On top 1/3 mark handle. With sharp paring knife, carefully cut
watermelon to create scallops and handle; Remove top sections. Scoop
melon into balls or wedges, reserving 6 to 8 cups for fruit basket.
(Refrigerate remaining melon for other use) Leave shell 1-inch thick.
Wrap watermelon basket in plastic wrap; refrigerate until ready to
serve. Fill with fresh fruit just before serving. Makes 42 (1/2-cup)
servings. (about 30 calories per serving)

TIPS: * Vary the fruit shapes and colors for an attractive salad.
Include balls, spears, cubes, and triangles.

* To use the most melon pulp, cut chunks or cubes rather than melon
balls. Use grapes, cherries, and strawberries for round shapes.

* Blueberries and raspberries are best used as a garnigh, since they
are fragile and bruise easily when tossed with other fruits.

* Sprinkle bananas, apples, and peaches with orange or lemon juice to
prevent discoloration.
