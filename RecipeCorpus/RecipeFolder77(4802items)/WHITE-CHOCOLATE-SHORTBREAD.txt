FROM:

One of our family's favorite cookies is shortbread. It's easy to
make, and VERY easy to eat.  This recipe also includes white
chocolate -- what more could you ask for. I was going to make this
shortbread tonight, but discovered that someone has eaten all my
white chocolate! I haven't determined the culprit yet, but my 7-year
old son is my number one suspect!

1. Preheat oven to 400 deg F.  Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan (or
your favorite shortbread mold).  Using a food processor fitted with a
metal blade, chop the white chocolate using on-off pulses, until it
resembles coarse meal.

2. Using an electric mixer set at medium speed, cream the butter with
the sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the flour. Stir in
the chopped white chocolate.

3. Pat the dough evenly into the prepared pan. Using the tip of a
sharp knife, score the dough into eight equal triangles.

4. Bake the shortbread until light golden in color, about 30 minutes.
Transfer in the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly. Remove the
shortbread from the pan and cool completely on the wire rack. Store
in an airtight container at room temperature.
