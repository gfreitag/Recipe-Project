Title: WHITE & GREEN BEAN SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Dried white beans, Great
-Northern, navy, or baby
-lima
6 c  Water
3    Cloves garlic, chopped
2 ts Salt
4 c  Beef broth
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 ts Rosemary, crumbled
2 c  Fresh green beans (about 3/4
-lb), cut on the
Diagonal in 1-inch pieces
1 tb Butter
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Wash and pick over the dried beans.  Put them into a large saucepan or
kettle with the water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat,
cover, and allow to stand for 1 hour.

Return to the heat and bring to a boil again.  Reduce heat and simmer,
partially covered, for 1/2 hour. Using a heavy fork, mash the garlic
with the salt until no large chunks remain. Add to the saucepan with
the beans. Add the broth, pepper, and rosemary.

Simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender. This can take 15
minutes or as long as 1 hour; timing for beans is hard to predict -
keep checking.

Soup can be made ahead to this point, and refrigerated or frozen after
thorough cooling.

Cook the green beans uncovered in 2 uarts of boiling salted water
until they are tender-crisp and bright green. Drain and add to the
soup when the white beans are tender but not mushy. If green beans
are not to be added right away, rinse in cold water to retain color.
Stir in the butter and lemon.  Serve at once, while green beans are
still bright.

Note:  If you want some of the soup pureed, do it before adding the
green beans - the color will be better.

Serves 6 to 8.
