Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Flour -- plus 2 Tb
1 tb Salt -- (I usually use
Less)
1/2 tb Baking Soda
4 oz Butter Or Margarine
6 tb Brown Sugar, Packed
6 tb Granulated Sugar
1 tb Vanilla
1    Egg
1/2 c  White Chocolate Chunks -- *
See note
1/2 c  Macadamia Nuts -- ** see
Note
* I buy large good quality candy bars, such as Lindt, and chop them
up. ** I use straight from the jar, you may prefer to chop up

Preheat oven to 375 F Mix all dry ingredients together in a separate
bowl In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy. Add
vanilla and egg--mix well. Slowly add dry ingredients to butter/sugar
mixture--mix well Add chocolate and nuts Spoon onto lightly greased
cookie sheets (I use cushionaire--no burning) Make whatever size you
what--I tend to make them large because it saves time Bake 8-12
minutes, depending on size of cookies--they should not brown, more of
a golden color Cool on rack

BTW:  I usually make a double batch of the dough, separate into
halves, and add regular chocolate chunks and pecans to one (and maybe
some coconut), white chocolate and macadamias to the other--two
cookies with half the work
