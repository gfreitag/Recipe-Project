Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads, Snacks, Mark's
Yield: 1 Foccacia
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 tb Yeast
1 c  Lukewarm water
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 ts Basil
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Wheat germ
3 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
3 md Tomatoes, sliced
Salt & pepper
Olive oil, for brushing
Basil, chopped
In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil & Basil.
Let stand until the yeast starts to froth. Mix in the wheat germ & 1
c flour. Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes. Knead in the remaining
flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable. Lightly oil a clean
bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled in bulk.

Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
the sheet. Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
Let rest for 10 minutes.

Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the tomatoes over the top.
Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top & finish with
the fresh basil. Bake for 25 minutes or until the crusts are done.
Cut up & serve immediately or let cool.  This is equally good cold &
served at room temperature.
