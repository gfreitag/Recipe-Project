Title: TOMATOES~ INTRODUCTION
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Text  Quality: Select only disease-free, preferably vine-ripened, firm
fruit for canning.

Caution: Do not can tomatoes from dead or frost-killed vines. Green
tomatoes are more acidic than ripened fruit and can be canned safely
with any of the following recommendations.

Acidification: To ensure safe acidity in whole, crushed, or juiced
tomatoes, add two tablespoons of bottled lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon
of citric acid per quart of tomatoes. For pints, use one tablespoon
bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid. Acid can be added
directly to the jars before filling with product. Add sugar to offset
acid taste, if desired. Four tablespoons of a 5 percent acidity
vinegar per quart may be used instead of lemon juice or citric acid.
However, vinegar may cause undesirable flavor changes.

Recommendation: Use of a pressure canner will result in higher
quality and more nutritious canned tomato products. If your pressure
canner cannot be operated above 15 PSI, select a process time at a
lower pressure.
