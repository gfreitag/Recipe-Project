Title: TOMATO & ORANGE SOUP
Categories: Vegan, Soups
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Onion; finely chopped
1    Garlic clove; finely sliced
3 tb Vegetable oil
400 g  Canned tomatoes
1    Orange; rind grated
150 ml Orange juice
600 ml Vegetable stock
Salt and pepper
This soup is a soft orangery-red colour, and has a wonderfully
refreshing flavour. Light, interesting food that will not damage the
bank account.

Soften the onions and garlic in the oil over a low heat for 6-8
minutes. Stir in the tomatoes with the juices from the can and the
orange rind. Heat through, mixing well, and simmer for 3-4 minutes.
Liquidize in the blender with the orange juice, then return to the
pan. Heat through, adding the stock as you stir the soup. Season to
taste and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.
