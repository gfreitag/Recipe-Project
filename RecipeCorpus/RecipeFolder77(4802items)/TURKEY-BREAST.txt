Title: TURKEY BREAST
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Turkey breast
Pepper
Canola oil
Salt
Cayene pepper
* Keep the skin on. Even thought it has the fat, it will keep the meat
moister. Slather the skin with the canola oil. It will help with the
browning. Most of the oil will dissipate during cooking. Sprinkle the
breast with salt, Black pepper, and Cayenne pepper. Place the Roast
on the grill with a moderate charcoal fire and cover. It will take
about 1 hour to cook a 2-3 lb breast. As always check it after the
hour and adjust. For those who are not fat intimidated, use butter
instead of oil and add a little hickory wood for smoke. The skin will
have a distinctive bacon flavor. Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK
