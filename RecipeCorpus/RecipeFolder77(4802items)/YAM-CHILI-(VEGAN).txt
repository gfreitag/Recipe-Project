Title: YAM CHILI (VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
1    40-oz can yams/sweet
Potatoes
1    29-oz can tomato puree
1    To 2 cup dried beans (*)
1/4 c  Barbecue sauce
1 tb Dehydrated onion
1 ts Black Pepper
1 tb Chili powder
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Cook up the beans normally (soak, boil, simmer).

Pour yams into pot, including liquid.  Smash lightly. Add tomato
puree, stir through.  Add spices, stir through. Add cooked beans,
stir through. Simmer for for a few minutes to mellow out.

(*) Beans:  I keep a 'bean bucket' of mixed beans, usually including
pea beans, black-eyed peas, pinto beans, split peas, lentils, navy
beans, pinto beans; often including great northern beans, roman
beans, pink beans, chili beans, barley, and others.  Whenever there's
room in the bucket I pour in a bag of something that seems
underrepresented.

This would probably be better with fresh yams and tomatoes, but the
canned yams were on sale half price the day after Thanksgiving...
