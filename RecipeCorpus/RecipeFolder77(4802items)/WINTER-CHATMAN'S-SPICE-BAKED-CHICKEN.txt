Title: WINTER CHATMAN'S SPICE BAKED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
Winter Chatman's Spice baked
Chicken
Buy 1 whole nice chicken at the market Wash well, inside and out Take
out liver, gizard, heart and put aside Assemble the spices below 2 or
5 tablespoons of McCormick or Shilling seasoning. Don't use Lowery's,
too salty Seasoned pepper 4 teaspoons garlic salt 4 teaspoons Italian
seasoning Mix all of the spices and put all over the chicken, inside
and out. Smother it! Wrap the chicken in foil and put in the freezer
overnight. Not the fridge, the freezer.  When your ready to cook it,
thaw and bake in a 450 degree oven until done. I tried it and it was
delicious. (PS.) She also said that you could also barbeque this!
Love and good cookin' Louise King
