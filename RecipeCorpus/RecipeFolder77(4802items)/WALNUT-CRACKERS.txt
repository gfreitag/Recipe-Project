Title: WALNUT CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 60 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Potato flour
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Plus 2 teaspoons (1/3
Stick) butter or margarine,
Softened
1/2 c  Finely chopped, toasted
Walnuts
1 c  Ice water
Salt for the tops (opt.)
"These crackers capture the essence of walnuts. Rich and meaty, but
at the same time light and crisp, they are excellent with a blue
cheese spread and a glass of port. 350~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat
the oven to 350~F.

Mix the flours and salt together in a large bowl or in the food
processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Add the walnuts and stir until they are evenly distributed
throughout. Blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will
hold together in a cohesive ball. The dough will be somewhat sticky.

Wrap the dough in wax paper or lightly buttered aluminum foil and
chill for at least 1/2 hour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. If desired,
sprinkle the tops lightly with salt and roll over the dough with your
rolling pin. With a cookie cutter, glass, or juice can, cut the dough
into 2-inch rounds.

Place them on a lightly greased or parchemnt-lined baking sheet.
Prick each round in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake for
25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Yield:
55-60.
