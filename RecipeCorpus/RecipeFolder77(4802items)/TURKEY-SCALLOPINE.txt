Title: TURKEY SCALLOPINE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
2    6 ounce Turkey Escalopes
1    Glass Sparkling Muscatel
-grape juice or vermouth
5 fl Double Cream
Salt and Pepper
1 tb Oil
1 tb Butter
Wrap the escalopes in clingfilm and flatten gently with the back of a
heavy frying pan until they are really thin. Peel off the clingfilm.

Heat the oil then the butter in a large frying pan. Put in the meat
and press down firmly so it is all in contact with the frying pan.

Let it sizzle for between one minute and a minute and a half,
depending on how thin you've managed to flatten the escalopes, turn
them over and repeat the timing.

The meat will be thoroughly cooked through - you do not ever want pink
turkey - but very tender. Put the meat on warmed plates.

Pour the grape juice or vermouth into the frying pan, stir it round
to pick up all the bits from the meat, then add the double cream and
let it bubble (double cream boils beautifully) and reduce slightly.

Pour it over the turkey and serve with pasta or new potatoes and
mangetout.
