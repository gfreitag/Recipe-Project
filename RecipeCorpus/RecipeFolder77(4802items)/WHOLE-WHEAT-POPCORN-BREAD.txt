Categories: Breads, Fat-free, Mcdougall
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/2 c  Water
1 tb Honey
1 ts Salt (I use Lite Salt)
3 tb Vital Gluten (rounded)
1 ts Dry Malt
1 g  Vitamin C crushed
3 1/2 c  Whole Wheat Flour (plus to
-make a round ball)
1 1/2 c  Milled Popped Popcorn
2 1/2 ts Yeast (Quick or Regular)
1. Pop popcorn. (I used an Air Popper) 2. Mill the popped corn. (I
milled mine in my Vitamix. I know it can also be done in a food
processor such as a Cuisenart and it can probably be done in any good
blender.) 8 cups of popped popcorn will yield 4 cups of fluffy
popcorn flour. 3. Put ingredients in breadpan in order given. 4. Set
for rapid bake. The resulting loaf is high and LIGHT!
