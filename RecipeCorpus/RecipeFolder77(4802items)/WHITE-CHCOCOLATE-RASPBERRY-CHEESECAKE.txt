MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------

1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar

Crust;  Put pecans in swall bowl with butter and MW on high for 1 1/2
minutes. Stir dry ingredients together in 10-inch springform pan. Add
butter and nuts and mix well. Pat onto bottom and sides.
Filling: Beat cream cheese until light. Add sugar and beat until
light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time; beating after each one. Add
remaining ingredients except berries and mix well. Pour into pan.
Drop berries on top and push down with fork so that batter covers
them. Bake at 350 for 1 1/2 hours in which a pan of water has been
placed on the bottom rack. Remove from oven and run   knife around
the edge to loosen from pan and prevent a cracked cake when cooling.
Topping: Stir sugar and cornstarch well in saucepan. Add berries and
water and cook over medium heat until thick and bubbly. Stir in
rum. Pour over cooled cake. (I refrigerate the cake for a day first,
then put topping on just before serving).
