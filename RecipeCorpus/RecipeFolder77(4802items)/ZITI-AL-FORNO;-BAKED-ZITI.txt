I got this recipe from my Italian Grandfather. Mix tomato sauce with
oregano and parsley, heat.  Slide sausage out of casing, brown until
light and crumbled, drain. Combine ricotta, nutmeg, salt, pepper and
sugar, blending well.  Cook and drain Ziti.  Spoon half the sauce in
9x13 casserole, half the Ziti, spoon on all the sausage and ricotta
mixture. Add remaining Ziti and top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle
with parmesan. Bake uncovered at 400 degrees for 15 min. or until
hot. This recipe can be made ahead and frozen or refrigerated, just
allow extra baking time.
