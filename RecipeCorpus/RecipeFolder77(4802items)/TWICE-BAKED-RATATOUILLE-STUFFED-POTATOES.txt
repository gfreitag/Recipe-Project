Title: TWICE-BAKED RATATOUILLE-STUFFED POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
Vegetable oil spray
1 md Onion -- chopped
1    Clove garlic -- minced
1 sm Eggplant
1 sm Red bell pepper -- cut into
Strips
1 md Zucchini -- diced
3    Plum tomatoes -- diced
1 tb Balsamic vinegar or cider
Vinegar
4 md Baking potatoes
1/2 c  Nonfat ricotta cheese
1/2 c  Nonfat Parmesan cheese
Cube the eggplant, toss with salt, and arranged in a single layer, if
possible, in a large colander.  Let drain for 20 minutes. Pat dry with
paper towels.

Bake or microwave the potatoes until soft.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

In a large nonstick skillet lightly sprayed with oil, in a few
tablespoons water, over medium-high heat, combine the onion, garlic,
and eggplant; cover and steam for 4 minutes, adding more water if
necessary to prevent sticking. Add the pepper, zucchini, tomatoes,
and vinegar. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer 12 to 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are tender.

Meanwhile, slice off the top third of the potatoes lengthwise, and
with a spoon, scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2-inch shell. (Reserve
the flesh for another use.) Spoon 2 tablespoons ricotta into each
potato. Fill the potatoes with the ratatouille. Sprinkle with 2
tablespoons Parmesan and bake 35 minutes.

Alternatively, place the potatoes in a microwave-safe dish, cover
with wax paper, and cook at high for 4 minutes, rotating once.
