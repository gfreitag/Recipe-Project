------- Note that this simple method will only
work with the opportunistic culture that occasionally arrives to
thicken an uncovered jug of soya milk that has been in use for a day
or two. Of course, once you've got some and made your first batch,
you can reserve 2-3 table- spoonsful as a starter for the next.
Also note that the very first batch you make will be little more
than a thickened, mildly flavored milk, but the taste will gradually
strengthen and the texture gradually thicken from batch to batch. If
you want to strengthen the taste of the batch you have at hand,
simply stir in a little lemon juice.
With this method there is no need to keep the jars warm during
fermentation -- once you've filled and shaken them you can simply put
them in the fridge to ferment and forget about them for a day or two.
This yogurt is excellent poured over breakfast cereals, fresh fruit
and puddings, or stirred into soups, just before serving. It's also
all right for making Lassi though you'll probably need to add a
little lemon juice as already mentioned.
