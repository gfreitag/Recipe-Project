I checked the subject list under Asian Cooking, and didn't see any I
recognized as this soup. I didn't have time to check each one
individually, so I hope this doesn't duplicate what you already have.
This is from the "Sunset Oriental Cookbook". Thinly sliced green
onion, including tops Prepare sesame seeds;place in a 5-6 qt. kettle
and add ribs, broth, water, soy, sugar, garlic, ginger,pepper, and
whole onions. Bring to a boil over med. heat;cover, reduce heat, and
simmer till beef is tender (2 1/2 -3 hrs.) Lift out ribs, and let
cool. Lift out and discard ginger and onions. Skim and discard fat
from broth. When ribs are cool, discard bones and fat; then shred
meat with fingers. Return meat to broth and add daikon. Bring to boil
over med. high heat;cover,reduce heat,and simmer till daikon is
tender to > bite (10-15 min.). Add oil. Gently break eggs, one at a
time, into barely simmering broth;cover and cook just till eggs are
softly set ( about 2 min.). Ladle soup and eggs into individual
bowls, and sprinkle sliced onions over top. Makes 3 or 4 servings. I
hope this helps. I haven't had this for a while, and I'm waiting for
cool weather. And in Texas, I've got a ways to wait!!!!! Carla in
