Stephen Ceidebuurg
3/4 c  Margarine or butter,
-softened
3/4 c  Honey
1/4 ts Almond extract
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Finely chopped almonds
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

In a large bowl, beat margarine, honey and almond extract with an
electric mixer until mixture is light and fluffy. Add flour, 1 cup at
a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in almonds. On
ungreased cookie sheets, shape 1/2-cup portions of dough into heart
shapes, no more than 1/2-inch thick. Decorate as desired by following
one of the tips below or by using a tooth-pick, fork or other kitchen
tool to create a design. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until edges turn
brown. Cool 5 minutes and remove from pan.

Decorating tips:

You can create a design on top of the cookies using white or colored
candy sprinkles.

Or you could crimp the edges of heart, making a design using the
tines of fork, or a knife, spatula or spoon. Sprinkle baked cookies
with powdered sugar.

If you are an experienced baker, you may want to paint a design with a
simple egg-yolk paint. Separate an egg; put the egg yolk in a small
bowl and mix with 1/2 teaspoon water and enough red food coloring to
make the desired sired shade of red. Using a clean paint brush, paint
a design on cookie using the colored yolk. Or place a small doily on
cookie and, using a clean, stiff brush, work the egg paint through
the cutouts and create a lacy effect. Remember that this is all done
before the cookies are baked.

Makes 4 large cookies.
