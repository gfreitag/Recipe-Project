2 c  1% fat milk
1/2 c  Liquid egg substitute
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
1/8 ts Salt (optional)
2 ts Non-diet, tub-style canola

In a 4-cup glass measure, mix the milk and egg substitute. Microwave
on high power 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes, stirring after each minute,
until the mixture is just hot, but not boiling. In the top of a
double boiler, mix together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt (if

the custard thickens. Remove from the heat.  Stir in the margarine or
butter and vanilla. Cover and place in the refrigerator.  Let cool,
stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.
