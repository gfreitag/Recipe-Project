Arrange bread in pairs of a work surface. Spread thousand island
dressing over all slices. Top each piece of bread with a slice of
cheese, folding the cheese in half to fit if necessary. Place 2 bacon
slices on 4 of the slices on the opposite 4. Spread tuna salad on top
of the 4 servings of bacon, then take the opposite halves of the
sandwiches and gently invert them on top of the tuna halves. Preheat
a skillet over medium heat. Lightly spread the fat free spread over
both sides of each sandwich. Place sandwiches in the preheated
skillet and cook until lightly toasted on bottom and flip and cook 3
minutes longer or until cheese has melted.
