Title: ZUCHINI BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
6 ea Eggs
2 c  Oil
4 c  Grated squash
2 c  Sugar
6 c  Flour
4 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Salt
2 ts Vanilla
Combine ingredients in Large bowl, mix well.  Pour into greased and
floured loaf pans.  Bake at 350 for 1 hour. Serve hot or cold with
butter, cream cheese, or just plain. Mmmmm. Variations: Applesauce or
pumpkin bread - use same as zuchini, but add 3 cups water and 4 tsp
ginger. Another thing I did often, was bake the batter in
cupcake/muffin tins. Then when the kids wanted a snack, they could
just take "one" without the worry or mess of slicing from the loaf.
