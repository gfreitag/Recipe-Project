Title: VEGETABLE & BACON RISOTTO
Categories: Italian, Meat, Miscellaneo, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Rashers Bacon, Rindless
-chopped
1    Carrot -- chopped
1    Onion -- chopped
2    Mushrooms -- sliced
Oil For Frying
3 oz Cooked Rice
1 c  Stock
Fry the bacon and vegetables together in a little oil. Add the rice
and fry for 1 minute. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Cover and
simmer for 20 minutes or until all the stock has been absorbed. This
meal is more substantial (and very good) when served with a fried egg
on top. Again depending on the degree of hungriness..
