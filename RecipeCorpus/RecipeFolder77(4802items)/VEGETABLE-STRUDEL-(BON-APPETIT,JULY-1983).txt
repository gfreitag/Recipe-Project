3 c  Chopped fresh broccoli
3 c  Chopped fresh cauliflower
2 1/2 c  Chopped carrots
2 tb Butter
1    Large onion, coarsely chopd
3    Eggs
2 ts Minced fresh parsley
1 1/2 ts Dried basil, crumbled

Freshly ground pepper
1 lb Swiss or cheddar, shredded
14    Phyllo sheets
6 tb Butter, melted

1    Recipe Hollandaise Sauce
Combine broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in steamer.
Place over boiling water and steam until crisp tender. Let cool
slightly. Melt butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion
and garlic. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden.  Let
cool slightly. Combine eggs, parsley and seasoning in large bowl and
beat well. Add steamed vegetables, onion mixture, and shredded
cheese. Mix gently but thoroughly. Preheat oven to 375.  Oil large
baking sheet and set aside. Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface
(cover remaining phyllo with plastic wrap to prevent drying.)  Brush
with melted butter. Stack remaining phyllo sheets on top, brushing
all but the last sheet with butter. Spread vegetable mixture onto
dough, leaving 3" border on all sides.  Fold in short ends of dough,
then fold in long sides, overlapping at center. Brush with butter to
seal. Carefully transfer strudel to prepared baking sheet. Brush top
with butter. Sprinkle with sesame seed if desired.
Bake until golden, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Transfer to heated
platter and serve immediately.  Accompany with Hollandaise sauce.
