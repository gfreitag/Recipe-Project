Title: WELSH CAKES (BAKESTONE RECIPES)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Plain flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Mized spice
2 oz Butter or margarine
2 oz Lard
3 oz Granulated sugar
2 oz Raisins (or currants)
1    Egg, beaten
3 tb Milk
Sift the flour, baking powder and spice into a mizing bowl. Cut the
fat into the flour, and rub it to a breadcrumb-like consistency; then
mix in the sugar and raisins. Mix in the egg, and sufficient milk to
make a stiff dough.  Roll out on a floured board to 1/4 inch thick.
Cut into 3 inch rounds.  Bake on a hot greased bakestone until golden
brown, about 4 minutes on each side. * Variation: "Teisen Dinca" --
Make up the Welsh Cake dough adding 6 oz peeled and grated cooking
apples before adding the egg. Mix to a stiff dough, adding milk if
necessary. Roll out, cut into rounds and cook on the bakestone as for
Welsh Cakes. Serve hot with butter, golden syrup, or honey.
