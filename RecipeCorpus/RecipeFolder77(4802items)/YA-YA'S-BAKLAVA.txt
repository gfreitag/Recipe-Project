To make filling:  In a small bowl, combine walnuts and cinnamon
until blended; set aside.
In a small saucepan, over medium heat, melt butter; keep warm.
Fold out stack of phyllo sheets; cover surface with towel or
plastic wrap to prevent drying.  Remove only one sheet at a time.
Brush a 12 x 18-inch pan with butter.  Spread a sheet of phyllo
into pan and brush with melted butter. Repeat until there are 6
layers of phyllo. Sprinkle one-third of nut filling on the 6th layer.
Add 6 more phyllo leaves, again brushing each with melted butter,
sprinkle with one-third nut mixture.  Repeat this procedure until all
ingredients are used, ending with 6 layers of phyllo for the top.
Brush top with butter.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Before baking, cut dough in pan
diagonally into 2-inch strips, then cut diagonally again to make
diamond shapes.
Bake for 45 minutes.  Pastry should be golden brown and flaky.
Pastry should be dry, not soft, in the middle.
Pour cooled syrup over hot pastry.  Pour only enough syrup to fill
halfway on pastry.  Serve warm or cooled. Stand back and watch it
