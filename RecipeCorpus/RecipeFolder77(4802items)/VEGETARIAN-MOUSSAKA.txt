First make the tomato sauce:  peel and mince onions. Saute onions in
about 2 T oil and about 2 T butter, over moderate heat, until they
are soft and lightly colored (about 8 minutes). Add mushrooms and
saute. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, parsley, seasonings and
sugar.

Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, for 30-45 minutes, stirring
occasionally.  Most of the liquid should be evaporated, and the
mixture quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it cool
completely.

Start seasoning the eggplants:  peel eggplants and slice vertically,
about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit
for 30 minutes.

Now make the Bechamel Sauce:  Place the milk in a saucepan and heat
it just until tiny bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set
aside.

Melt one cube butter in a 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until
foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 T flour, stirring
constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and still being careful not to
let it brown. Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When
the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in
seasonings. Cool sauce slightly.

Back to the eggplant:  Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and
pat dry.  Dredge the eggplant in about 1 1/2 cups flour and saute in
olive oil.

Put it all together:  Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth and
creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs
until thoroughly incorporated.

Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the top of the
tomato mixture.

Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan and sprinkle the bottom with a few
bread crumbs.  Place a layer of eggplant in the pan, following with a
layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and grated
cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to last.

Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 degrees
F. for one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top.
Remove moussaka from oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes;
the delay allows the layers to fuse.

NOTES:

the faint-hearted.  It's very good and it takes a lot of work. Don't
waste it on someone who would be just as satisfied with steak and
salad!

: Time:  1 1/2 hours to prepare, 1 hour to bake, 20-30 minutes to set
and cool.  Some can be done ahead of time.
