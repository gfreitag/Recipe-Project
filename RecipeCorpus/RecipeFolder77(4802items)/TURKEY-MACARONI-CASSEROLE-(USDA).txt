Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
2/3 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Unsifted flour
4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Marjoram
2 qt Hot milk
1 1/4 qt Cooked elbow macaroni -- (2
3/4 c  Uncooked)
1 1/2 lb Cooked turkey -- diced (5
Cups)
10 oz Processed cheddar cheese --
Shredded (2 1/2 c)
3/4 c  Pimientos -- chopped
TOPPING FOR EACH CASSEROLE
1/4 c  Shredded cheese
Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

Melt butter.  Stir in flour and seasonings.  Stir in hot milk slowly.
Cook until thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in macaroni, turkey,
cheese, and pimientos.  Pour one-fourth of mixture into each baking
pan. Spread mixture well to avoid air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate).
Sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded cheese over macaroni mixture in baking pan.
Bake 30 minutes or until cheese is melted.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN CASSEROLE:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded
cheese over frozen macaroni mixture. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until
mixture is bubbly at edges and center is hot.
