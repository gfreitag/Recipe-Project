TO MAKE PASTRY: In food processor, combine flour, pinch salt and
butter. Pulse on/off turns til mixture ressembles coarse crumbs.
While processing is running, add ice water processing until dough
pulls away from sides of processor and forms a ball. Form dough into
a dish shape. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450F. Roll out pastry out on floured surface to 14
inch diameter circle. Fit into 10 inch tart pan with removable
bottom. Fold in extra pastry along edge so sides of tart will be
thicker. Place tart pan on baking sheet. Line tart shell with double
thickness of foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake at 450F
for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove foil and weights or beans. Cool tart
shell on rack. Reduce oven temperature to 400F. To make filling:
Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese in bottom of cool, prebaked pie shell. Cut
each tomato in 5 slices. Seed tomato slices. Pat tomato slices dry
between paper towels, gently pressing to extract as much juice as
possible. Arrange tomato slices in pastry shell in single laye rover
cheese. Set aside. In medium bowl, whisk eggs, cream, mustard, 1/4
tsp salt and white pepper to taste until blended. Pour over tomatoes.
Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Bake tart shell on baking sheet at 400F
for 35 to 40 minutes or till filling is puffed and set in centre. Let
stand 10 minutes before serving. YIELD: 6-8 SERVINGS
