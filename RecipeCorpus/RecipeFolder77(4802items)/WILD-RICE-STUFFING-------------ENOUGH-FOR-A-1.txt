Title: WILD RICE STUFFING
Categories: Rice, Misc
Yield: 1 Servings
3 tb Butter Or Bacon Fat
1 tb Salad Oil
1 md Onion, Chopped
1 1/2 c  Raw Wild Rice
1 c  Broken Walnuts
2 c  Chopped Celery
The Giblets, Chopped
1 ts Minced Parsley
1 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Minced Sage
1 ts Salt
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
4 c  Boiling Chicken Broth
Melt the butter with the oil in a heavy skillet or large saucepan and
saute the onion until soft.  Add the rice and cook, stirring often,
until slightly colored. Add the walnuts, cook for 5 minutes, then add
the celery, and cook until the rice is golden. Stir in the herbs and
seasonings and the giblets.

Pour on the boiling liquid, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed,
about 30 minutes, and the rice is just barely done.

Amounts may be adjusted to the size of the bird.  This recipe should
stuff a 15-lb turkey.
