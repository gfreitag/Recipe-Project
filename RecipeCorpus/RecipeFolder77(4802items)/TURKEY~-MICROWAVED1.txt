Categories: Poultry, Microwave
Yield: 10 Servings

TURKEY COOKED IN THE MICROWAVE REMAINS TASTY LONGER THEN OVEN

First stuff the turkey with your favorite stuffing mix. Then paint the
turkey with the prepared turkey basting agent (see index). Gently
place the stuffed and painted bird in the flour dusted roasting bag
and place into a glass microwave roasting pan.  Enter the weight of
the turkey on your microwave computer.  For example, a 12 lb, 8 oz
bird will cook in the microwave oven 115-121 minutes at 70% power.
Standing time will be 57-60 minutes. Dividing the time into fourths,
the bird will cook at 70% power for about 29 minutes on its breast
side; turn the dish and cook another 29 minutes.  Now carefully turn
the bird upside down (there will be a lot of juices in the bag, so be
extra careful). With the bird breast side up, cook another
29    minutes at 70% power.
