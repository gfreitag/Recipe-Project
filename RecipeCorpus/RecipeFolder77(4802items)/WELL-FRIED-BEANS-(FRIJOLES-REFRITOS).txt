Title: WELL-FRIED BEANS (FRIJOLES REFRITOS)
Categories: Mexican, Beans
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Beans, cooked (3-1/2 to 4
-cups with broth)
A 10 inch frying pan
6 tb Melted lard or pork
-drippings
1/4    Onion, finely chopped
2 oz Queso fresco, crumbled (I
-used shredded Monterery
-Jack)
12    Totopos (fried tortillas, or
-tortilla chips)
Some romaine lettuce leaves
6    Radish roses
Heat the lard and fry the onion, without browning, until it is soft.

Add 1 cup of the beans and their broth to the pan and mash them well
over a very high flame. (With a bean masher or wooden potato masher)
Add the rest of the beans gradually, mashing them all the time, until
you have a course puree.

When the puree begins to dry out and sizzle at the edges, it will
start to come away from the surface of the pan. As you let it
continue cooking, tip the pan from side to side. The puree will form
itself into a loose roll. This will take from 15 to 20 minutes.

Tip the roll, rather like folding an omelet, onto the serving dish and
garnish with the cheese.  Spike it with the crisp triangles of
tortillas. Decorate.
