3 lb Frying chicken
1/2 c  Lemongrass, about 4 stalks
minced  **
-
3    Scallion; all of them
2 tb Peanut oil
2    Red chile peppers; chopped
2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Chicken stock; fresh / can'd
1/4 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
1 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1/2 c  Dry-roasted peanuts; chopped
2 tb Nuoc Mam  **
Coriander leaves; chopped
Hack the chicken into small serving pieces, chopping through the
bones with a very sharp cleaver.
Remove the outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely slice the
tender white part at the base of the stalks. Bruise with a mortar and
pestle or the handle of a cleaver.
Finely slice the scallions, including the green tops.
Mix the chicken with the salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the lemongrass
and scallions and set aside for 30 minutes.
Heat a wok and add the oil, and when the oil is hot add the chicken
mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes.
Add chile peppers and stir-fry on medium heat for 10 minutes or
until chicken no longer looks pink.
Season with sugar and pepper and add the chicken stock. Stir for a
few minutes.
Garnish with the peanuts, "nuoc mam" and coriander.
Serve with rice, if desired.
This quickly prepared but terrifically flavorful dish is great
served with rice paper wrappers.  I love it with a few leaves of mint
and basil. This is one you must try. It is easily done in a wok. By
