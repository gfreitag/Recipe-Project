electric mixer beat the cream cheese until it is light and fluffy;
add the sugar and beat in the whole eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time

vanilla, and add the melted chocolate in a slow stream, beating until
the filling is well combined.

Scatter the raspberries over the bottom of the crust, pour filling
over them, and bake the cheesecake in the middle of a preheated 250F
oven for 1 hour, or until top is firm to the touch. Let the
cheesecake cool in the pan on a rack; chill, covered loosely,
overnight. Remove side of pan to serve.
