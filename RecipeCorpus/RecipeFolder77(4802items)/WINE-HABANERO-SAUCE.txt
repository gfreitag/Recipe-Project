Title: WINE-HABANERO SAUCE
Categories: Sauce
Yield: 8 Servings
20    Habaneros
1 lg Chipotle in adobo sauce
--or-
3 sm Ones
1    White onion; chopped
2    Cloves garlic; chopped
1 ts Ground cumin
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2    Apple; peeled
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Distilled white vinegar
1 tb Lemon juice
3/4 c  White wine
Stem and seed the habaneros, leaving the inner membranes. Combine the
habaneros with all the other ingredients except the lemon juice and
wine in a blender and process to a fine puree. Transfer to a
nonreactive pan and cook over low-medium heat for ten minutes. Add
lemon juice and wine, mix well and transfer to sterilized sauce
bottles. Keep refrigerated, shake well before use.

I found that this sauce improves over time, apparently as the wine
turns into vinegar.
