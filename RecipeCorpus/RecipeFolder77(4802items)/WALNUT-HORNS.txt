Title: WALNUT HORNS
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 5 Dozen
2 c  Flour
1 c  Butter
8 oz Sour cream
1    Egg yolk
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Walnuts, ground
1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
Butter
Cream the flour and butter.  Mix in the sour cream and the egg yolk.

Divide the dough into four parts, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for
several hours.

Mix together the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon.

Roll each dough section on a floured surface until about 1/8 inch
thick. Spread about 1/4 of the sugar/walnut/cinnamon mixture over
each rolled dough section. Cut the dough into pie-shaped wedges and
roll, beginning at the wide end.

Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush with melted butter
(about 2 T should be enough). Bake for about 20 minutes at 375
degrees F. If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn
brown, the dough will be softer and flakier. If you remove them after
they have browned slightly, the dough will be crisper.

Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled completely,
or else they stick to the cookie sheet.

NOTES:

*  Rolled, walnut-filled cookies -- This recipe has been in the
family for a while. These cookies make great Christmas gifts.

*  During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful. However, now
they strike me as a bit sweet. You could probably decrease the amount
of brown sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 and make up for the loss in volume by
increasing the amount of nuts.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  Initial preparation:  10 minutes; chilling: at least 2 hours;
