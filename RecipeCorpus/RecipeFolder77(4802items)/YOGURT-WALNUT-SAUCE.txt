The pronounced flavor of walnuts is tamed somewhat by the acidic tang
of fresh yogurt.  Beating the yogurt, much like whipping cream, gives
the sauce a very special texture. Serve it with poultry, salads, cold
poached or baked fish, or with cold steamed shrimp or lobster. While
it can be tossed with the other ingredients, it is better when it is
spooned onto the salads by the individual diners. Prepare this
dressing on the same day that you plan to serve it.

Beat the lemon juice into the yogurt in a medium-size bowl. Fold in
the remaining ingredients.  Refrigerate the dressing several hours,
beating once more just before serving.

A very simple recipe that I am sure that no one would have tasted
before. Simply a grand recipe for the next dinner party. Highly
Recommended.
