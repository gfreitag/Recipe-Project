The farm kitchen is a busy place, and sometimes there's only enough
time to stir up a quick dessert like this. This pudding tastes much
like pie and is served similarly.

Whipped cream Cinnamon for topping

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch pie pan. In a large
mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt,
mace, and cinnamon. Stir in eggs and vanilla. Blend well. Fold in the
apples and walnuts. Turn mixture into the pie pan and bake 25 to 30
minutes, or until browned and crusty on top. Serve with whipped cream
and sprinkle with cinnamon.
