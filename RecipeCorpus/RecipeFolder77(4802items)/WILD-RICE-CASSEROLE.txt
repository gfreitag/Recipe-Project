Title: WILD RICE CASSEROLE
Categories: Main dish, Side dish, Digest
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Wild rice, uncooked
1 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced
-thickly
1 c  Minced onion
3 c  Vegetable broth
3    Cloves garlic, minced
Rinse wild rice well.  Combine wild rice, mushrooms, onion, and
garlic in a 3 quart casserole dish. Pour broth over it all, cover,
and bake at 350 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours.

I use the "jumbo domestic Canadian" wild rice for the best results,
but any wild rice will taste good.  I usually stir after an hour of
baking. The liquid is absorbed all at once toward the end, don't
panic! I add a teaspoon of salt when entertaining SAD eaters, and
often increase the amount of onion and garlic when my husband and I
are eating alone.

I am a wild rice fanatic and mail order mine from a place in
Minnesota. I can e-mail the address to anyone who is interested.
