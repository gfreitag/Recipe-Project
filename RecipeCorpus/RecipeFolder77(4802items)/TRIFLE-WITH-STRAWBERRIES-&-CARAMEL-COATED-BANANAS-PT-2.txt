caramel back into bowl. Layer half of banana slices atop berries,

Spoon half of custard over bananas, spreading to side of dish. Repeat
layering with cake, rum, berries, banana slices and custard. Arrange

caramel syrup to glaze. Spoon cream into pastry bag fitted with
medium star tip. Pipe cream around fruit. Garnish with mint, if
desired.
