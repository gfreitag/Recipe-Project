Title: YORKSHIRE PUDDING 2
Categories: Quickbreads
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
1 c  Sifted flour
1/2 ts Salt
Beef Drippings
I find it best to mix this well in advance and chill it before
cooking.

Beat the eggs and milk together. Sift the flour and salt into the egg
mixture and beat until well blended.

Heat the oven to 450 F. Pour about 1/4 c of beef drippings into and
11 x 7 inch backing pan or muffin tin and heat the drippings until
they begin to smoke. Pour in the batter and place in the oven for 10
minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 F and bake for a further 15
minutes.

This is about enough for four normal people although I could eat half
of this myself.

I find that opening the oven door during the baking can produce
disappointing results so I don't. From: David Gibbons Converted by
