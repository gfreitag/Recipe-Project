the marinade. Coat the sides and bottom of a baking dish with 2 or 3
Tbs. of Sesame oil and arrange to pork in the dish so there is only
one layer of the meat.
Bake in a  pre  heated oven (375 F) for 50 minutes until the meat is
tender. While the meat is bak- ing take the marinade and in a sauce
pan bring to a boil.
When boiling  re- duce the heat to low and cook for approx 15
