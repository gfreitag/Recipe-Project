10). Drop Cookies: Cookies uniform in size will finish baking at same
time. Use ice cream scoop with release bar to easily shape drop
cookies. a #80 or #90 scoop yields about 1 teaspoonful of dough. Make
sure cookies are spaced apart as directed in recipe so as not to
crowd cookies.
11). Rolled cookies: Doughs are usually easier to shape and roll
after a period of refrigeration. Remove only enough dough from
refrigerator to work with at one time.

12). Bar cookies: always use the pan size called for. Substituting a
different size pan will affect texture of cookie.
13). Refrigerator cookies: For firm and smoothly shaped rolls, wrap
rolls securely in waxed paper to chill before slicing. Unwrap and
slice evenly with a thin, sharp knife. Use gentle back and forth
motion when slicing so they keep their shape. Rotating the roll while
slicing also prevents one side from flattening.
