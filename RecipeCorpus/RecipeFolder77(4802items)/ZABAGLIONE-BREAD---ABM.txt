This fat-free recipe reproduces the sweetness, flavor and lightness
of the dessert Zabaglione in a bread with a thick, sugary crust and a
soft moist center.

Serve plain or toasted with fruit or coffee.

Add all ingredients in the order recommended by your bread machine
manual and process on the bread cycle according to the mfg's
directions.
