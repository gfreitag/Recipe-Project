Title: TOMATO & FONTINA QUICHE
Categories: Breakfasts, Suntomato
Yield: 4 Servings
-Robbie Shelton
9" Pie Shell; unbaked
1/2 c  Sun-Dried Tomatoes;
-marinated in oil
1 c  Italian Fontina Cheese;
-grated
1/3 c  Scallions; thinly sliced
1 1/4 c  Half-and-Half
2 lg Eggs
White Pepper; to taste
Prick the bottom of the pie shell with a fork. Chill for 30
minutes or freeze for 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425F.  Line the pie shell with waxed paper and
fill with pie weights or beans.  Bake for 10 minutes, remove the
paper and weights, and continue to bake for another 5 to 6 minutes,
or until golden. Reduce the oven temperature to 375F and cook the pie
shell while you prepare the filling.

In a bowl, toss together the tomatoes, cheese, and scallions.
Sprinkle the mixture evenly in the pie shell. In a bowl, whisk
together the half- and-half, eggs, and pepper. Pour into the shell
and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted 1/2 inch
from the edge comes out clean. The custard in the center of the
quiche won't be fully set, but it will continue to cook after being
removed from the oven. Let stand for about 20 minutes.  Serve warm.

Although other cheeses, especially Swiss, work well with this
recipe, it is really worth the effort to seek out a high-quality
fontina cheese. The nutty, sweet flavor of fontina and it's terrific
texture when melted are a wonderful complement to the salty, chewy
tomatoes.
