Karen Mintzias
2 1/2 c  100% whole wheat flour
1 ts Mixed spice
1/4 lb Vegan margarine; PLUS:
4 tb Vegan margarine
1 c  Real Barbados sugar
1 1/2 c  Mixed dried fruit
1/4 c  Mixed candied peel
1/4 c  GlacÂ‚ cherries
-rinsed and halved
1    Orange; rind grated
2 tb Ground almonds
1/4 c  Blanched almonds; chopped
1/2 c  Soy milk or water
2 tb Vinegar
3/4 ts Baking soda
Extra vegan margarine
-for greasing
Preheat the oven to 300 F.  Grease an 8-inch layer cake pan and line
with a double layer of greased wax paper

Sift the flour with the mixed spice into a mixing bowl. Rub the
margarine into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture looks
like fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the sugar, dried fruit, mixed
peel, cherries, orange rind, ground and blanched almonds.

Warm half the soy milk or water in a small saucepan and add the
vinegar. Dissolve the baking soda in the rest of the soy milk or
water, then combine the two mixtures.

Stir this mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring well so that
everything is combined.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until a skewer inserted into the center
of the cake comes out clean.

Leave the cake in the pan to cool, then remove and strip off the wax
paper. Transfer to a wire rack and allow the cake to cool completely.
