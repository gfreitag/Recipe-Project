Title: VENISON STEW #3
Categories: Stews
2 lb stew meat
Yield: 1 Servings
6    carrots
6    potatoes
2 TB oil
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 md onion
2    bay leaves
1 ts salt
1 ts sugar
1/2 ts pepper
1/2 ts paprika
1 ds allspice

Brown the cubed meat in the oil, add two cups of water, then the rest
of the ingredients.  Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours. Remove bay leaves,
add carrots and potatoes, cook another 30-45 minutes or until tender.
As a footnote, I've just browned the meat, then dumped everything in
the "crockpot" on low.  It produces a stew that tastes as tho' it
already been reheated several times.  IMHO, that's the best stew.
