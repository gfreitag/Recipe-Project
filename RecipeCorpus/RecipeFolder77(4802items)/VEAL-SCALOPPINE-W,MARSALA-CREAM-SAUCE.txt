Title: VEAL SCALOPPINE W/MARSALA CREAM SAUCE
Categories: Meats, Sauces
Yield: 3 Servings
2 tb Unsalted butter or olive oil
1 lb Thin veal scallops
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Dry Marsala
1/3 c  Whipping cream
Salt & freshly ground pepper
-to taste
Heat the butter in a large skillet.

Dredge the scallops in the flour and add to the pan (you may have to
do this in two batches).

Brown the scallops quickly (a minute or so on each side). When they
are brown, transfer them to a platter and keep warm.

Pour off any fat remaining in the pan and return to the heat. Add the
Marsala.

Scrape the bottom of the pan, and add the cream.  Stir constantly
over high heat until the sauce thickens a little. Season with salt
and pepper to taste.  Pour sauce over the scallops. *Lower-fat
Version: Use chicken stock instead of whipping cream.  Use olive oil
to cook the veal. Yield: 3 - 4 servings.  Typed in MMFormat by
