1.  Put a large pan of water on for the pasta. When it has come to the
boil, start the pasta cooking.

2.  Melt the butter in a small pan, and when melted add the tuna,
anchovies, and garlic and tarragon if you are using them. Mash
together with a fork, and let them cook gently, stirring
occasionally, until the butter has been absorbed. Don't let it fry!

3.  When the pasta is cooked to your taste, drain well, and stir in a
little oil or butter to keep it moist.

4.  Serve the pasta in a large bowl, with the fish mixture, pesto and
mayonnaise in smaller bowls. Let everyone dig in!
