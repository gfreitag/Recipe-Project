Title: VIRGIN PINA COLADA
Categories: Non-, Alcohol, Mixed, Drinks
Yield: 1 Servings
2 oz Coconut cream
1 1/2 oz Crushed pineapple
1 oz Pineapple juice
1/4 c  Crushed ice
1    Orange slice
1    Maraschino cherry
Place all ingredients in a blender and blend at high setting until
smooth -- about 30 seconds. Strain into highball or collins glass and
garnish with orange slice and cherry.

NOTE: Crushed pineapple juice canned in its own juice is preferable
for a less-sweet drink; use pineapple canned in syrup for a sweeter
concoction.
