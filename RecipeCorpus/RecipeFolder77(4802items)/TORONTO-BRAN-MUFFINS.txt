Title: TORONTO BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/4 c  Hot milk
3 ea Eggs
2 tb Oil
Combine cereal with hot milk in a 1-1/2  quart mixing bowl and let it
stand about 10  minutes---or until the cereal has absorbed all of the
milk. With the electric mixer on high speed, beat in the oil and eggs
till completely blended.   Remove the beaters.   Switch to a sturdy
spoon and dump in the cake mix,  stirring only to moisten all of it
thoroughly---but don't overmix or overbeat or the muffin texture will
be heavy and tough. The batter will be a bit lumpy. Cover the bowl
and let the batter stand 15 minutes while you preheat the oven to 400
F, and grease 12 muffin tin wells in Crisco, evenly. Divide batter
equally between the 12 wells. If you are using cupcake tin wells, you
will have 15 muffins. Bake at 400 for 20 to 25 minutes,  or till
golden brown.   Wipe tops of each while still warm in softened
butter  or margarine.
