Title: WARM ASPARAGUS WITH TARRAGON VINAIGRETTE
Categories: Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 3 Servings
1 lb Asparagus
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 tb Dijon-style mustard
1/4 c  White wine vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2    Shallots peeled, finely
-chopped
2 tb Minced fresh tarragon
This simple dish has such a compelling taste, you'll never have
leftovers. Trim the asparagus, discarding woody ends. Steam the
spears whole, for about 3 or 4 minutes, until just tender when
pierced with a fork. Do not overcook.  Rinse in cold water, drain.

Place the olive oil in a small bowl; add the mustard and beat until
the oil thickens.  Add the vinegar, salt pepper, shallots and
tarragon. Arrange the still-warm asparagus on a serving plate and
pour the dressing over it.

Serves 3 or 4.
