Title: WINE TASTING CRACKERS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 60 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
2 tb Vegetable shortening
2/3 c  Water
"A tender, crisp cracker with a neutral flavor. These are excellent
for cleansing the palate while tasting wines, and they are also the
perfect foil for cheeses of all kinds. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes
Preheat the oven to 350~F. In the food processor or in a large bowl,
mix the flour and baking soda. Cut in the shortening until the
mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly stir in enough of the water to
form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the
dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or
pastry cloth, roll into a rectangle no thicker than 1/8 inch thick.
With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares. Place on a
lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each square 2
or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or
until medium brown and crisp. Remove to a rack to cool. Yield: 50-60.
