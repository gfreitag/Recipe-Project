Title: TRACEY'S MUSHROOM/TOFU LASAGNE
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
900 g  Jar spaghetti sauce (I
Prefer Ragu no-suga
450 g  Lasagne noodles uncooked
375 g  Block of soft tofu
450 g  Cottage cheese
450 g  Ricotta cheese
450 g  Mozerella cheese sliced or
Shredded
450 g  Provolone cheese sliced or
Shredded
50 g  Parmesan cheese (approx.)
225 g  Mushrooms thickly-sliced
1.  Preheat oven to 180 øC .

2.  In a large bowl, break up tofu with a fork until it looks like
cottage cheese. Stir in the cottage and ricotta cheese until the
mixture is uniform.

3.  Put a small amount (50 ml) of spaghetti sauce in a large lasagne
pan until the bottom is thinly coated. Add 3 or 4 uncooked lasagne
noodles (they won't completely cover the bottom), then add enough
sauce on top of noodles so that about 1/3 jar of sauce is used up.
Next add 1/3 of sliced mushrooms, then 1/3 cottage cheese mixture,
then 1/3 each of mozerella, provolone, and parmesan cheese. Make two
more layers of noodles, sauce, mushrooms, cottage cheese, and sliced
cheese.

4.  Cover the lasagne with foil, making a "tent" if you can so the
top does not touch to cheese. Make sure the edges are crimped
tightly. Bake for 1 hour at 180 øC (you can take the foil off the
last ten minutes if you want the cheese to brown), and let stand 15
minutes to set. The noodles will be a little chewy, and the lasagne
is also very good (perhaps even better!) reheated. .SH "Alternate
Baking Instructions:" Bake the foil-covered lasagne for 45 minutes,
then let cool. It can then be frozen or refrigerated for baking
later. If frozen - bake at 180 øC (with foil) for 45 minutes. If
refrigerated, bake at 180 øC (also with foil) for 20 minutes. These
methods produce softer noodles.

Difficulty    : moderate. Precision
: approximate measurements.
