Categories: Candies, Chocolate
Yield: 30 Servings
-Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
8 oz White chocolate; finely chop
1 c  Shredded sweetened coconut;
-divided
1    Large egg yolk; at room
-temperature
2 tb Coconut liqueur or light rum
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
Melt the butter in a heatproof bowl over very hot, not simmering,
water. Add the white chocolate and melt, stirring occasionally, just
until smooth. Remove from the heat and whisk in 1/4 cup of the
coconut, the egg yolk, coconut liqueur, and vanilla. The mixture may
separate, but keep whisking and it will come together. Cover tightly
with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours or
overnight. Using a melon baller, scoop up the mixture and roll into
1-inch balls. Roll each ball in the remaining coconut, pressing the
coconut on so it will adhere. Refrigerate until ready to serve. (The
truffles can be prepared up to 3 days ahead, tightly covered, and
refrigerated, or frozen for up to 1 month. Makes about 30 truffles.
