Zucchini bread recipe from Ralph Hunter/114 W. Forest
Ave./Hodgenville, KY 42748 on 08/23/93.  He said he got the recipe
from Margaret Garmon of Cumberland County, Ky., where Ralph and his
wife Edith lived all of their lives until moving to Hodgenville in
April 1993. Mary L. Harmon, my cleaning lady, said it was the best
zucchini bread she'd ever had. Ralph frosted it with the penuche
frosting. The penuche frosting recipe is from _Betty Crocker's
Cookbook_. New York: Golden Press, 1969. Twelfth printing, 1972.
