Categories: Pork, Barbeque
Yield: 1 Servings
5 lb Pork loin back ribs
MMMMM--------------------------DRY RUB-------------------------------
4 tb Paprika
2 ts Salt
2 ts Onion powder
2 ts Pepper, black
2 ts Pepper, white
2 ts Pepper, red
MMMMM-----------------------BARBEQUE SAUCE----------------------------
6 tb Salt
6 tb Pepper, black
6 tb Chili powder
4 c  Ketchup
4 c  Vinegar, white
4 c  Water
1 ea Onion, large, yellow, diced
1/2 c  Molasses, sorghum
Barbeque Sauce:  Combine ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring to a
rolling boil, reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 10
minutes or so. Pour into sterilized canning jars, seal and let stand
2 to 6 weeks before use.  (If you are like me, not much chance of
this happening, but it is a nice touch to the recipe - CWS)

Dry Rub:  Mix ingredients together thoroughly.

Preparation:  Sprinkle dry rub liberally on ribs. Allow ribs to stand
20 to 30 minutes at room temperature until the rub appears wet.
Prepare a smoker for long, slow (230 degree) indirect cooking, using
hickory chips or other hardwood chips for extra flavor. Cook ribs,
bone side down, for 2 hours at 230 degrees in a smoker using indirect
heat. Turn and cook 2 more hours. Turn and cook one more hour. During
the last 15 minutes, baste with barbeque sauce diluted by half with
water. Serve ribs with warmed, undiluted sauce on the side.
