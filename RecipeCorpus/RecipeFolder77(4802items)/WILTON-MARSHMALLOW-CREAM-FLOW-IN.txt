Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Frostings, Wilton
Yield: 1 Batch
1    Jar marshmallow cream for
-each color desired
Icing color
This stays very shiny and is easy to cut through. These decorations
will not dry hard as Wilton color-flow & must be done directly on the
cake or cookie.  CAUTION - Marshmallow cream will be VERY HOT. TO
PREPARE MARSHMALLOW CREAM - Pan Method: Place about 1 1/2" water in a
large skillet or electric pan.  Depending upon design,  set up to
four jars of marshmallow cream (one for each color) into pan and
bring water to a boil. For faster heating, fill jars only halfway.
Add icing color as the cream softens, stir until color is well
blended. Let simmer, then stir until cream is smooth.  Leave jars in
water while you decorate. Microwave Method: Place the desired amount
of marshmallow cream in a bowl. Add desired past color.  Microwave on
high power for about 10 to 12 seconds, then stir. If not softened
(the total time depends on quantity being heated) microwave again for
7 to 8 seconds more. After heating, stir until color is completely
blended. TO DECORATE: Trace pattern on cake with a toothpick. Outline
design with stiffened buttercream or royal icing (royal is preferred
as the heat of the marshmallow cream may soften buttercream) and tip
3. Let outlines dry for 10 minutes or more. Cut a very small opening
in the end of a parchment bag and fill with marshmallow cream.
"Flow-in" by filling in along the edges of the outline first,
squeezing gently and letting the icing flow up to the outline almost
by itself. Work quickly; filling in design from the outside edges in
and from top to bottom. If you're working with a large area, have 2
parchment bags ready so it won't set up before you're done.  If the
marshmallow starts cooling and won't flow smoothly, simply microwave
bags for about 7 to 8 seconds on high power.  Any remaining cream can
be stored in a jar & reused by microwaving for 8-9 seconds until soft.
