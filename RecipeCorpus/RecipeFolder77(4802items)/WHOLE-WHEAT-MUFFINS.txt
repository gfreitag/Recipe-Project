Title: WHOLE WHEAT MUFFINS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Flour, whole wheat
2 tb Oil
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1    Eggs
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Milk, sour
1/2 c  Raisins; chopped (opt)
Preheat oven to 425.  Mix all dry ingredients thoroughly (do not
sift); add shortening, egg, and sour milk. Beat only until smooth.
Fill well-oiled muffin tins 2/3 full.  Bake about 25 minutes.

If sour cream is used, omit 1/2 shortening.

Sylvia's comments: the batter was too liquidy, and the baking times
were too long.  I'll use 1/4 c less liquid next time. They were done
after 20 minutes. They also stuck to the paper liners, so need more
oil.
