Title: VEGGIE BURGER MIX
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 c  Dry garbanzo beans
1/2 c  Dry soybeans
1/2 c  Dry lentils
1/2 c  Yellow split peas
1/2 c  Instant brown rice
1/2 c  Rolled oats
1 pk Dry soup mix or
Salad dressing mix
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1/4 c  Cornmeal
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
Put the ingredients one by one in a blender.  Turn on the blender.
Run for cover (it's pretty noisy).  When everything is reduced to
powder, combine i a container. To use, mix 1 cup of the mix with 2/3
cup HOT water or combination of water and BBQ sauce, water and wine,
or whatever other liqui you can think of. Let sit 15 minutes, then
form into 3 patties. Cook in a pan coated with nonstick spray. NOTE:
If you use BBQ sauce as part of the liquid, they wi brown much faster
~ must be the sugar in the sauce. This recipe makes 4 cu of dry mix.

The variations for this are endless, as you can use different dry
mixes. Good Seasons makes fat free dry salad dressing mixes, and
there are lots of different flavors of soup mix (I think onion soup
would be good). You coul also use the dry seasoning mixes, like the
taco seasoning, etc. Some of the are fairly high in sodium, but I
would think that in a quantity of mix, it would average out to an
acceptable level.
