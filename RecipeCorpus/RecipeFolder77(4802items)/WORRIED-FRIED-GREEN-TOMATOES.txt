Title: WORRIED FRIED GREEN TOMATOES
Categories: Vegetables, Tomatoes, Meatless
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 lb Green tomatoes, sliced verti
-cally 1/4 inch thick
3    Garlic, clove, sliced
3/4 c  Flour
Salt
Pepper
4 tb Olive oil
Shake tomato slices in a paper sack with salt, pepper and flour. Heat
oil over medium-high heat in a black iron skillet. Add tomatoes and
garlic. Cook without stirring for about 5 minutes, then, using a
stiff spatula, scrape bottom of skillet and turn tomatoes. Continue
to cook over medium to high heat, scraping bottom of skillet
occasionally to prevent burning. You want the tomatoes which come in
direct contact with the skillet to get dark. You should expect some
sticking; just scrape hard. Try to resist adding more oil but do so
if you must. When most of the tomatoes have turned olive green or
dark brown, about 20 minutes, lower heat to low. Continue to cook,
worrying the tomatoes around with the spatula until they are all
either brown or olive green.
