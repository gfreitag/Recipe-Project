1    Level teaspoon sugar
1/2    Level teaspoon MSG

"The Buddhists, whether monks or ordinary people, mingled freely with
the non-vegetarians, and because the manners of Chinese society are
all-embracing and diffuse, felt obliged to provide food which looked
and almost tasted like meat.  This was a sign of hospitality. Their
cuisine was based on nuts, spices, vegetables, sauces, sesame, peanut
and vegetables oils, and bean curd.  The last was the factotum, now
appearing as duck, then as chicken, then as fish.  Its very lack of
personality made it an excellent actor."

Soak the bean curd in water for about 1/2 hour until soft. Mix
together the remaining ingredients, and marinate the bean curd in
this mixture for about 2 hours.

Select the largest and smoothest sheet and lay it on a flat surface.
Place the remaining sheets on top of it evenly, so that when rolled
up it will form a cylinder of regular dimensions. Roll it up VERY
tightly. Place it on a single piece of cheese-cloth or old sheet and
roll it up, with the cloth overlapping both at both ends. Tie the
bundle at both ends like a toy firecracker at the two points where
the bean curd ends. Steam the roll for about 1 hour.  Cool the roll
and unwrap it. Slice the roll into 1/4-inch slices and serve cold.
