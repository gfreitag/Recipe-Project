Title: UNDESCENDED TWINKIES
Categories: Desserts, Beverages
Yield: 4 Servings
6 oz Orange Jell-O; (2 pkgs)
1 c  ;Boiling Water
1/2 c  Pineapple Juice
1 qt Vanilla Ice Cream; Softened
7 oz 7-Up
8    Twinkies
Dissolve Jell-O in boiling water.  Add pineapple juice, ice cream and
7-Up. Mix thoroughly (In a blender if necessary to dissolve ice
cream), and pour into a deep pan, approximately 9-inches square.
Chill until mixture begins to set.  Lay Twinkies, flat side down, in
two rows of four across the top of the chilled gelatin. If the
gelatin is properly chilled, it will resist the Twinkies.  You will
push them in and they will slowly rise. Remember you don't want them
buried. Just semi-decended in the ooze. Chill until fully set and
serve.
