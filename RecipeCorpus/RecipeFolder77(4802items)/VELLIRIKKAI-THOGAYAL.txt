Categories: Sauces, Vegetarian, Indian
Yield: 1 Batch
1 lg Cucumber
3 tb Sesame oil
1 ts Black mustard seeds
1 ts Urad dal, white
1/2 ts Methi (fenugreek)
2    Dried red chillies
1/2 tb Tamcon paste
1 pn Hing
Salt; to taste
Peel cucumber, slit into half, scoop out seeds. Slit into further
narrow strips and cut tiny pieces as for kachumbar. Should not be
grated as this gives no 'bite' feel in the mouth.

Next, warm the oil and fry all ingredients except the tamarind.
Mustard should stop spluttering and dal/methi should turn brown.
Drain out these fried spices into a blender, leaving oil behind in
pan.

Add cucumber and stir fry for two minutes, no more.

Add tamcon to spices in blender and with half the cucumber run on low
speed till everything looks coarsely ground and blended. Remove into
a bowl, add remaining cucumber pieces and mix well.
