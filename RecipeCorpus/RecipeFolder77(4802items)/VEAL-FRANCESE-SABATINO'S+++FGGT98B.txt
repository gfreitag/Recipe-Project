cream, seasonings, pars- ley & cheese. Dip the veal pieces into the
bat- ter & then into the bread crumbs. Shake off the excess.2. Heat
olive oil & butter in a large frying pan until hot. 3. Saute veal
until crisp on both sides. Remove from skillet, add the flour to the
pan drippings, enough to form a smooth paste, & stir until smooth.
Pour in the sherry, Marsala, lemon juice & chicken broth. Bring to a
boil. Season with salt & pepper. 4. Strain over cooked veal. Top each
piece of veal with a piece of prosciutto ham & a thin slice of lemon.
Serve. Note: Make sure the fat in the skillet is quite hot before you
add the breaded pieces of veal, otherwise the crumbs will absorb the
fat.
