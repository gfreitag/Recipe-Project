Put one whole orange in a small saucepan, cover with water and simmer

Preheat the oven to 180 C/350 F/Gas 4.

Grease a 23 cm/9in shallow cake tin and line with greaseproof (waxed)
paper.

Chop the cooked orange roughly, discard the pips and liquidize,
including the skin.

Mix together the ground almonds, sugar, baking powder and almond
extract in a bowl.  Beat the eggs with a fork, beat in the liquidized
orange, then pour into the bowl containing the other ingredients and
mix well. Pour this mixture into the prepared tin and sprinkle the
top with pine kernals. Bake in the middle of the oven for 35 minutes,
or until a skewer comes out clean.  Leave to cool slightly, then turn
out on to a wire rack.

Just before serving, peel off the paper and sprinkle the top of the
cake with a little icing sugar.  Serve in wedges with slices of
orange and fresh tayberries or loganberries.
