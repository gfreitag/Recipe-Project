Title: YALANCHI SARNA (STUFFED GRAPE LEAVES)
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 qt Water
8 oz Preserved grape leaves
- stems removed
1 c  Rice; cooked
1 md Onions; grated
2 tb Parsley; minced
2    Tomatoes; finely chopped
1 ts Mint, dried
1/2 ts Allspice
1    Garlic cloves; minced
1    Lemon, juiced
Water; (as needed)
In a medium saucepan place the water and bring it to a boil. Remove
the pan from the heat and add the grape leaves. Let the grape leaves
sit in the hot water for 10 minutes. Remove them from the water and
set them aside.
In a medium bowl, place the cooked rice, onions, parsley, tomatoes,
dried mint, allspice, and garlic. Mix the ingredients together well.
Let the mixture sit for 2 hours.
In the center of each grape leaf place a small amount of the rice
mixture. Fold the bottom of the grape leaf up and the sides over.
Roll the grape leaf up.
Line the bottom of a large saucepan with some of the grape leaves.
Place the rolled grape leaves on top, seam side down, so that they
are tightly packed.
Sprinkle on the lemon juice.  Add enough water to cover the rolled
grape leaves.  Place an oven-proof plate on top of the rolled grape
leaves to press them down. Cover the pot and bring the liquid to a
boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer the rolled
grape leaves for 45 to 60 minutes, or until most of the water is
absorbed. Let them sit for 1 hour before serving.
