Title: ZAMPONE WITH POTATOES & BALSAMIC MUSTARD VI
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Zampone sausage, about 4 to
-5 pounds
2 lb Russet potatoes, peeled, cut
-in 3/4" cubes
4 tb Melted butter
1 c  Whole milk
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
1/4 c  Dijon mustard
3/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1/4 c  Freshly snipped chives
Wash and dry the Zampone. Prick the Zampone about 20 times all over
with a needle. Place in a pot large enough to submerge the sausage in
water. Fill the pot with warm water and bring to just a boil. Lower
the heat slightly, so the water remains almost boiling. Cover and
continue cooking for 1-1/2 hours.

Uncover and check the internal temperature of the sausage with a meat
thermometer. Cook until the temperature reads 150 degrees. Turn off
the heat and let stand.

In a 12- to 14-inch non-stock saute pan, melt the butter over medium
heat. Add the potatoes and saute slowly until lightly browned on all
sides. Add the milk and simmer uncovered, until softened, about 10
minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to stand in a warm place.

In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the mustard and vinegar.
Slowly add the extra virgin olive oil in a thin stream, forming an
emulsion. Stir constantly until all the oil is added. Add the snipped
chives and check seasoning.

Remove the Zampone from the water. Carefully slice half the sausage
into 1/2-inch rounds. On a large serving platter, spread the potatoes
around the base. Place the Zampone pieces and slices over the
potatoes. Pour the vinaigrette into a serving pitcher, allowing each
person to dress his or her own portion. Serve immediately.
