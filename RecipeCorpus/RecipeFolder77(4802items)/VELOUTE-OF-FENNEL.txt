Title: VELOUTE OF FENNEL
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 10 Servings
10 tb Unsalted butter
6 lg Heads fennel
- trimmed and thinly sliced
6 tb Unbleached all-purpose flour
8 c  Chicken stock
- preferably homemade
4    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Whipping cream
Salt
Pepper
Chopped fresh chives
- for garnish
MELT 4 TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER in a large, heavy skillet over medium
heat. Add the fennel, cover and slowly braise, stirring occasionally,
until the fennel is completely softened and lightly browned, about 30
minutes. Transfer it to a food processor fitted with a steel blade
and puree. Set aside. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy large
saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour and stir with a wooden
spoon until the flour is cooked but still light in color, 3-to-4
minutes. Slowly add the stock to the flour mixture, stirring
constantly. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and
simmer gently for 30 minutes. Stir in the fennel, then pass the soup
through a fine strainer, if desired. (The soup may be prepared ahead
of time, to this point.) Just before serving, bring the soup to a
simmer. Combine the egg yolks and cream in a small bowl, and beat
well. Gradually add about 2 cups of soup to the yolk mixture. Slowly
blend the yolk mixture back into the remaining soup. Be careful not
to let the soup boil or the eggs will curdle. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Ladle into warm bowls and garnish with chives.
