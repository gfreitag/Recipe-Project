Title: TURKEY EMPENADAS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Cooked turkey, cubed
1 1/3 c  Cheddar cheese, grated
1 cn (4 oz) grn chilies, drained
1 c  Flour whole wheat
1/4 c  Corn meal
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Butter
1/4 c  Water, cold
1 tb Milk
4 ts Corn meal for topping
Mix together turkey, cheese and chilies; set aside. In a different
bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal and salt. Cut in butter until
particles are the size of small peas (a pastry blender makes this an
easy job). Sprinkle with water and mix with pastry blender or fork
until pastry can be formed into a ball.  Add a little more water if
necessary.

Divide dough into balls, one ball for each two servings; divide turkey
mixture into same number as dough.

Turn one dough ball onto floured board and roll into an 11" square.
Place on oiled cookie sheet.  Spoon one part of turkey mixture over
1/2 of pastry, coming to 1 1/2" of the edge. Fold other half of
pastry over it, and crimp edges to seal them. Repeat this procedure
with each ball of dough.

Brush turnovers with milk.  Sprinkle remaining corn meal on top. Bake
at 400 degrees for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool
slightly; slice into wedges to serve.
