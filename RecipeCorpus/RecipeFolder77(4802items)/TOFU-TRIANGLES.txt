1/2 lb Firm tofu
1 tb Corn or canola oil

1 ts Minced ginger root
1/2 c  Chopped onion

Dry the tofu and crumble into small pieces with a fork. Heat oil in a
nonstick wok; saute ginger root until brown. Add chopped onion and
blended curry powder; stir and cook for 2 minutes.

Add tofu, mushrooms, soy sauce, pepper, sherry, paprika and bouillon;
bring to a boil.  Add sesame oil and blended cornstarch; mix well.
Cool.

Place a portion of the curried tofu (about 2 teaspoons) in the center
of a wonton skin.  Fold the skin diagonally into the shape of a
triangle. Seal the edges with water.

Heat oil for deep-frying.  Fry the tofu triangles until brown and
crisp. Serve with vinegar, equal amounts of soy sauce and vinegar, or
Sweet and Sour Sauce, or eat plain. Makes 30 triangles.
