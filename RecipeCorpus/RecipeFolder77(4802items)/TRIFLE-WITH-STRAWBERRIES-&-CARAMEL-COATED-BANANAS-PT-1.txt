Cake: Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly spray 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch
jelly roll pan with vegetable oil spray. Line bottom of pan with
waxed paper, extending paper slightly at short ends; spray paper.
Using electric mixer, beat 5 eggs, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar,
1-3/4 teaspoons vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon salt in large bowl until
mixture triples in volume and is thick enough to fall in heavy ribbon
when beaters are lifted, about 12 minutes. Sift 1/2 cup plus 2
tablespoons flour over batter in 2 additions, gently folding just to
combine after each addition. Drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons butter over
and fold in gently (do not overmix or batter will deflate). Pour
batter evenly into prepared pan.

Custard: Place milk in medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla
bean; add bean. Bring to boil. Whisk yolks, sugar and flour in medium
bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk in hot milk mixture. Return
mixture to pan; whisk over medium heat until custard thickens and
boils, about 4 minutes. Strain into medium bowl. Press plastic wrap
onto surface. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. Using electric
mixture, beat cream in medium bowl to stiff peaks. Fold cream into
cold custard. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

Syrup: Stir sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy small saucepan over low
heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring
until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet
pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally. Remove from heat. Add 3
tablespoons water (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir until
caramel is smooth. Pour caramel into medium bowl; mix in remaining 2
tablespoons water. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; let stand
at room temperature.)

Assembly: Sift generous amounts of powdered sugar over 2 kitchen
towels. Cut around pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn cakes out onto
prepared towels. Peel off paper.

Stir jam and 2 tablespoons rum in small bowl to blend. Cut each cake
crosswise in half. Spread half of jam mixture over 1 piece of each
cake. Gently press second piece of each cake onto jam.

Cut cake sandwiches crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Arrange
enough cake strips in 3 1/2- to 4-quart glass trifle dish or bowl to
cover bottom, trimming strips to fit and allowing jam layer to show
at sides. Brush cake layer with 2 tablespoons rum. Top with half of
sliced berries, arranging some to show at sides of dish.
