Title: UNICORN'S PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE
Categories: Miamiherald, Desserts, Cheesecakes
Yield: 20 Servings
Crumb crust
2 3/4 lb Cream cheese; softened
1 lb Fructose (fruit sugar)
5 tb All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 ts Nutmeg
1 tb Cinnamon
2 tb Butter
6 lg Eggs
1 lb Pureed pumpkin
1 c  Heavy cream
*Note: The Unicorn uses a graham cracker crust for its cheesecake. A
standard recipe would call for 3 cups finely ground crumbs combined
with 12 tablespoons melted butter or margarine. Press into bottom and
up the sides of an ungreased 10-inch springform pan.

To make the filling: Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer on
medium speed until fluffy.  Stir together fructose, flour and salt
and blend gradually into cream cheese. Add vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon,
and butter, keeping mixture smooth.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating
after each addition. Beat in pumpkin and heavy cream and turn into
prepared crust. Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees F, or until set. Cool
completely on a rack. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
