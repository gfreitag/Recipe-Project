Cover the ancho chiles with warm water. Weight down with a plate to
submerge. Let stand 1 hour to soften. In a large stockpot, heat the
olive oil. Add the onions, leeks, carrots, celery, parsnips,
potatoes, and mushrooms. Saute until they just begin to color. Drain
the anchos andremove the seeds and stems; then add them to the
stockpot along with the spice seeds, herbs, tomatoes, red wine, and
water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially
covered, for 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper. Strain carefully,
to remove all the solids. Cool. The stock can be covered and stored
in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or frozen indefinitely. Note:
If more "heat" is desired, leave half the seeds in the ancho chiles.
The seeds of chiles contain more of the heat than the flesh.
