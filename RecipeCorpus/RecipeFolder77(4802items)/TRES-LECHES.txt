1 c  Sugar
5 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
MMMMM-------------------------MILK SYRUP------------------------------
1 cn Evaporated milk 12 oz
1 c  Sweetened condensed milk
1 c  Heavy cream or whipping crem
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Light rum
MMMMM--------------------------MERINGUE-------------------------------
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cream of tarter
3    Egg whites
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter a 13X9 in baking dish.
Prepare the cake:  beat 3/4 of the sugar and the egg yolks until
light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Fold in the milk, vanilla, flour
and baking powder. Beat the egg whites to soft peaks, adding the
cream of tarter after 20 seconds. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup
sugar and continue beating until the whites are glossy and firm but
not dry. Gently fold the whites into the yolk mixture. Pour this
mixture into the buttered baking dish. Bake the cake until the cake
feels firm and an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 40 to 50
minutes.  Let the cake cool completely on a wire over with a fork.
Prepare the milk syrup: combine the evaporated milk, sweetened
condensed milk, cream, vanilla and rum in a mixing bowl. Whisk until
well mixed.  Pour the syrup over the cake, spooning the overflow back
on top until all is absorbed.

Prepare the meringue:  Place 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbls of the sugar in a
heavy saucepan with 1/4 cup of water. Cover and cook over high heat
for 2 minutes.  Uncover the pan and cook the sugar to the soft ball
stage, 239F on the candy thermometer, 6 - 8 minutes. Meanwhile, beat
the egg whites to soft peaks with the cream of tarter. Add the
remaining 2 Tbls sugar and continue beating to stiff peaks.  Pour the
boiling sugar syrup i a thin stream into the whites and continue
beating until the mixture is cool to touch. The hot syrup "cooks" the
whites. Using a wet spatula, spread the top and sides of the cake
with a thick layer of the meringue. Refrigerate the cake for at least
2 hours before serving.
