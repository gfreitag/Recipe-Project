FROM:

A deliciously different way to make a pear tart. Caramelized fresh
pears bake under a flaky curst. When turned out, the handsome fruit
design shows.

Pare, halve and core pears.  Slice 7 or 8 halves crosswise and on an
angle, each into 4 or 5 slices, keeping slices intact. Arrange as
whole halves in a 9-inch deep pie plate, rounded side down ans stem
ends towards center; trim one pear half to a round to fit center.
Slice remaining pears into 1/2-inch slices, arrange on top to fill
plate.

Melt 1/2 cup of teh sugar over medium-high heat in a small heavy
skillet; continue heating until sugar caramelized and turns
golden-brown. Remove from heat; quickly stir in butter until almost
melted, then pour over pears.

Prepare piecrust mix, following label directions or make pastry from
your favorite single-crust recipe. Roll out to a 10-inch round on a
lightly floured pastry board; place on top of pears. Do not attach to
edge.

BAke in 425~ oven for 30 minutes or until crust is golden and pears
are done. (Place a piece of foil under pie in case juices should
bubble out.) Cool on wire rack about 30 minutes. Invert onto a
serving platter with a rim. (Pie will have formed a syrup.) With a
baster or spoon, remove syrup to a 1-cup measure. (You should then
have about 1/4 cup, depending on the fruit.)

Melt remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a small heavy saucepan. Heat very
slowly until sugar melts into a colorless liquid, then turns
golden-brown color and is caramelized. Stir in the reserved fruit
syrup from the tart. Boil the syrup rapidly until it is reduced to
about 1/2 cup. It will be slightly thickened.  Take care it does not
scorch as you are boiling.

Just before serving, spoon warm caramel sauce evenly over tart,
reserving 1 Tbsp.  Spoon or pipe whipped cream onto center; drizzle
reserved caramel sauce over.
