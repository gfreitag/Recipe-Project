Title: WHITE TRASH
Categories: Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
18 oz Box golden graham cereal
15 oz Box golden raisins
3 c  Roasted mixed nuts & pecans
12 oz Chocolate morsels
2 c  Peanut butter
1 ts Watkins vanilla
1/4 lb Margarine
1 lb Powdered sugar
Mix dry ingredients.  In a sauce pan, slowly melt margerine, chocolate
morsels, and peanut butter, stirring constantly. DO NOT BOIL. Add
vanilla and cool. Pour sauce (about 1/3 at the time) over cereal mix
and mix until well coated.  Pour into a large grocery bag and shake
with the powdered sugar (about 1/2 box at the time). Store in tightly
covered container. This makes enough for a crowd and is nice for
gifts. It is a sweet version of the popular Nuts and Bolts.
This was given to us Christmas 1991 by Mary Alice King of Dixie Union,
