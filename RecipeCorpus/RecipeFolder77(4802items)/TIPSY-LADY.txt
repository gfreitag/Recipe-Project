MMMMM-------------------------TIPSY LADY------------------------------
1    Sponge cake; 8 or 9"
-diameter
Or pound cake
1/3 c  Cream sherry
1/3 c  Brandy
2/3 c  Raspberry or strawberry jam
1 c  Heavy cream; whipped
1/3 c  Slivered almonds; toasted
Whip the egg yolks and sugar in the top of a cold double boiler. Pour
in the scalded milk, whisking all the while. Set the pot over boiling
water and continue stirring until the custard starts to thicken and
will coat a spoon smoothly.  It will fluff up and resemble
hollandaise sauce. Stir in the vanilla and pour the custard into a
mixing bowl. Chill in the refrigerator.  When cold, whisk lightly to
soften, fold in the whipped cream, and set aside.

Split the cake into 3 layers and sprinkle them with sherry and brandy.
Spread 2 layers with jam.  Place one of these layers in a clear glass
serving bowl barely large enough to hold the whole dessert, and
sprinkle it with more sherry and brandy, followed by half of the
Bavarian cream. Stack the second jam-covered layer on top and repeat
the procedure, using up the remaining sherry, brandy, and Bavarian
cream. Place the third layer on top and cover with whipped cream.
Sprinkle with the toasted almonds. Refrigerate for at least 1 to 2
hours before serving so that the flavors blend and the cake moistens
properly.
