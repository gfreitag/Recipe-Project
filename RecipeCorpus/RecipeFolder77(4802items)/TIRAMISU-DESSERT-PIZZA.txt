Title: TIRAMISU DESSERT PIZZA
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
12 oz Mascarpone cheese
1/3 c  Confectioners' sugar
1/4 c  Brewed espresso, cooled
Unsweetened cocoa powder
Confectioner's sugar
Fresh raspberries (garnish)
In a food processor or mixing bowl, whip the mascarpone cheese and
confectioners' sugar until smooth and creamy.

Beat in the espresso. The mixture should be creamy and easy to spread
at this point; if not, add a bit more espresso.

Spread a thick layer of tiramisu filling over a baked pizza shell.
Dust the cheese liberally with cocoa powder, followed by a very light
dusting of confectioners' sugar to achieve a dappled effect.

Fresh fruit such as raspberries can be arranged around the edge of the
pizza as a garnish.
