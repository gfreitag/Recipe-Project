First prepare batter, using mixing bowl.  Separate the yolk and white
of 1 egg, beating each separately and thoroughly.  Then combine both,
adding enough superfine powdered sugar to stiffen. Add to this 1
pinch of baking soda and 1/4 oz. rum to preserve the batter. Then add
a little more sugar to stiffen.  To serve, use hot Tom and Jerry mug,
using 1 tbl. of above batter, dissolved in 3 tbl. hot milk. Add 1-1/2
oz. of rum. Then fill mug to within 1/4 inch of top of mug and stir
gently. Then top with 1/2 oz. brandy and grate a little nutmeg on
top. The secret of a Tom and Jerry is to have a stiff batter and a
warm mug.
