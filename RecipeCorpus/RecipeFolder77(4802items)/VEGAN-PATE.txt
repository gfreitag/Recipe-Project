Recipe by: Kay Hinga <HINGA@IPFWCVAX.BITNET> Mix all ingredients
together. Pour into a 9" square pan - It looks a bit soupy but don't
worry. Bake at 350 degree F. for one hour (+15-20 minutes) until
golden brown. The top will be firm, but inside will still be liquidy
~ this is OK, as it cools to a pate-like consistency. Refrigerate and
serve cold. Use this on crackers, or as a spread for sandwiches. Hope
you like it. It also seems that we could get some interesting flavor
variations by playing with the spices.
