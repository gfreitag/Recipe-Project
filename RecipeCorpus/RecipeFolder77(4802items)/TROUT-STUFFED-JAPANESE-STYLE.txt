Title: TROUT STUFFED JAPANESE STYLE
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 lb Mushrooms, sliced
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Seeded, sliced in 1/4"
4    Eggs, lightly beaten
Strips, red or green pepper
2 ts Soy sauce
4    Trout, 8-10 oz. boned with
Skin, head and tail
3    Scallions, cut in 1/2"
Including greens
8    Strips of bacon
1 c  Bean sprouts
2    Ribs celery, sliced
Mix the vegetables together.  In a large skillet or wok heat oil,
then toss in the vegetables and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the eggs
and soy sauce and continue to toss and cook for another minute until
eggs begin to coagulate.
Stuff each of the 4 trout with one-fourth of the vegetable
mixture--the filling will expand the opening by about an inch. Wrap 2
slices of bacon around each trout, tucking the ends under the trout.
Bake in a large baking dish so trout are not touching in preheated
500 degree oven about 15 minutes, until skin is crisp and the fish is
opaque to the bone.  Test after 12 minutes. Vegetables will remain
crisp.
