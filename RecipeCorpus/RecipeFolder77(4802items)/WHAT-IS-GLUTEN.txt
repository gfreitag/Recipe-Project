Let's clarify the distinction between GLUTEN and the DEVELOPING of
Gluten through mixing and kneading (what Jackie calls "making
Gluten"):

++  GLUTEN (also called 'VITAL GLUTEN') is one of several components
of the wheat berry that is milled to make flour. It is high in
protein and contributes to a lighter bread, higher rise, and
IMPORTANTLY for those of us at high altutude, an elastic quality that
reduces the liklihood of a rising loaf falling (like a balloon
bursting because the rubber won't stretch anymore) -- GLUTEN gives
the dough more stretch.

++  DEVELOPING THE GLUTEN (what Jackie describes) is the result of
mixing and kneading that results in the elastic properties described
above being developed in dough from Gluten in it. By hand kneading,
or by kneading in an automatic breadmaker, the elasticity that Jackie
described develops ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT GLUTEN IS PRESENT in the
flour.

++  Various flours have more or less GLUTEN present -- All flour has
some GLUTEN (or VITAL GLUTEN) -- Bread Flour has considerably more
Gluten -- this is good for bread making and bad for cake making and
other uses (which is why there are other types of flour (e.g. ALL
PURPOSE FLOUR) ++ The ADDITION of GLUTEN (VITAL GLUTEN) beyond what
is already in the flour is for several reasons: -- It is added to ALL
PURPOSE flour to give it the GLUTEN amount already in BREAD FLOUR.
For some this is economics, since ALL PURPOSE FLOUR with Gluten added
is often cheaper than BREAD FLOUR.
-- It is added to BREAD FLOUR to give extra rise and consistency
(that is why bakers use it) -- It is added at high altutudes to
provide extra elasticity. The chemical reason has to do with reduced
density (pressume) at high elevations which causes the 'bubble' of
rising bread to [fall] if the dough lacks extra elasticity. ADDED
Gluten is nice for some - critical at high Alt.

++   GLUTEN (or VITAL GLUTEN) is available at health food stores for
use for the reasons noted above.
-- Many health food stores have it in bulk -- Most also have it in
boxes especially ARROWHEAD MILLS IN A 10 oz box ($ 2.19 to $2.69
