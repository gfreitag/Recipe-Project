Categories: Desserts
Yield: 16 Servings
1    9 inch chocolate layer cake
2 lb Semi-sweet chocolate
8 oz White fondant
2 c  Whipping cream
With a serrated knife or thread, cut cake into two layers and place
one layer in a 9 inch springform pan. In a double boiler, over hot
water, melt chocolate and fondant. Or, use a microwave oven to melt
the ingredients, allowing 12 minutes for chocolate, 20 seconds for
fondant - medium power. Heat 1/2 cup cream to lukewarm. If using a
microwave, allow 30 seconds. Beat the remaining chilled cream until
it forms soft peaks; set aside. In a large bowl, combine warm cram
with fondant and melted chocolate. Stir until ingredients are evenly
blended and the temperature is reduced to lukewarm. Beat the soft
chocolate mixture and gradually incorporate the whipped cream. Spoon
one-half of the creamy chocolate mixture over cake. Top with second
layer of cake. Complete by spreading the second half of the chocolate
mixture over top. Refrigerate the cake for 8 to 12 hours. Serve
chilled with whipped cream and chocolate curls. Serves 16. From The
Gazette, 90/12/12. The recipe is from Chef Steven McKeown at the Cafe
de Paris, 66 St. Louis in Quebec City.
