This is a 'mother' recipe. It illustrates the Italian approach to
preparing vegetables.  The dish features tuna, so the tuna's quality
matters greatly. If canned, chose tuna packed in olive oil; if fresh
tuna, grill or poach it, marinate in extra virgin. See further for
detail.

1. Marinate the onion with vinegar for 15 minutes. Drain the onion.

2. Put the beans in a serving bowl. Mix with the onion, extra virgin
olive oil, salt, and pepper.

3. Drain the tuna, break it into flakes or chunks with a fork, and
scatter it on top of the beans. Sprinkle with the parsley.

Description and Detail: Preserved tuna, packed in extra virgin olive
oil, is paired with white beans in Tuscany, a speedy dish to assemble
if you've got beans on hand. Canned beans work well and simplify this
preparation: open a few cans and chop an onion. Quality tuna makes a
big difference in the success of this dish. Leftover grilled or
poached tuna can be used instead of canned but it should be marinated
in extra virgin olive oil. All choices will work better than water
packed tuna. Scallions can be used in the spring, red onions for the
rest of the year. Torquato, my farmer and muse, suggested combining
green beans with tuna during his glorious green bean season, a
fantastic idea. (Feniger) Recipe By : Milliken-Feniger: KCRW's Good
