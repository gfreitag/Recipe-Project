Title: VENISON JERKY~ FROM ANDREA CASSONI
Categories: Cyberealm, Wild game
Yield: 10 Servings
2 lb Sliced venison 1/8" thick
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Salt
1 ts Ground red pepper
2    Cloves garlic, sliced
1 c  Corn whiskey
1 c  Water
Slice the meat when it is lightly frozen. The cuts should be long,
thin and with the grain. Cut across the grain if you want more
tender, but more brittle jerky.

Trim off all of the fat. Marinate strips in a glass container
overnight. You may substitute 2 cups of red wine for the corn whiskey
and water.

Pat dry and arrange pieces side by side on an oven roasting rack,
with- out overlap. Cook at minimum heat (150F) for 6 hours. Leave
oven door ajar to allow moisture to escape. Meat should be dark, dry
and store jerky in a cool, airtight container.
