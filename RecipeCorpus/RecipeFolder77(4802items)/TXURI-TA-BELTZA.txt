"Another interesting old delicacy is Txuri-Ta-Beltza which is Basque
for black and white. Again it comes from the days when nothing could
be allowed to go to waste, but, if made properly, it can be quite
delicious and it can still be found on restaurant menus in the valley.

"Txuri-Ta-Beltza is nmade from the large and small intestines of a
lamb. Clean the small intestine, boil it and chop finely. Mix with
garlic, an onion and a little parsley, all raw and finely chopped.
This forcemeat is bound with 5 well beaten eggs. Then prepare the
large intestine, clean it and turn it inside out like a glove. Fill
with the stuffing, tie well and boil in water until it looks like a
sausage and is thoroughly cooked.

"The second part of the recipe involves boiling the animals blood.
Once this is cooked put it in a casserole with a little oil, garlic
and a small piece of fatty bacon. Saut 82 well and add a little
tomato and onion sauce, prepared beforehand.

"Allow the sausage to cool and then cut into thin slices and serve
with the blood cooked with tomato."
