Title: YUMMY BRUSCHETTA
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
5    Roma tomatoes, finely
-chopped (or processed!)
3 tb Minced red or white onion
1 ts Capers, rinsed
-(optional...nice for
-color)
3    Garlic cloves, minced
2 ts Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Chopped fresh basil
1 tb Chopped fresh oregano
1 ts Freshly ground black
-pepper
-salt to taste
Mix this all together in a container and let sit for at least one
hour! We ran everything through the food processor, so it hardly took
any time at all. It tasted great that night, and the leftover report
is that it improves over the next couple of days!
