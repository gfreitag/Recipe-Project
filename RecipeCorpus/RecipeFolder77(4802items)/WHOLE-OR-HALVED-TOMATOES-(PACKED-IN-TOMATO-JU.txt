Title: WHOLE OR HALVED TOMATOES (PACKED IN TOMATO JU
Categories: Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 21 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 13 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 15 to 21 quarts-an average of 3
pounds per quart.

Procedure: Wash tomatoes. Dip in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds or
until skins split, then dip in cold water. Slip off skins and remove
cores. Leave whole or halve. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid
to the jars (See acidification instructions). Add 1 teaspoon of salt
per quart to the jars, if desired.

Raw pack -- Heat tomato juice in a saucepan. Fill jars with raw
tomatoes, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Cover tomatoes in the jars with
hot tomato juice, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.

Hot pack -- Put tomatoes in a large saucepan and add enough tomato
juice to completely cover them. Boil tomatoes and juice gently for 5
minutes. Fill jars with hot tomatoes, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Add
hot tomato juice to the jars to cover the tomatoes, leaving 1/2-inch
headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations
in Table 1, Table 2 or Table 3 depending on the method used.

============= NOTE: This section of the guide appears to contain some
sort of error in the information given within Table 2 above. In the
USDA book, there are only TWO sizes of jars specified in the table,
but there are THREE separate lines of figures in the table, and it is
not completely clear which jar size the second and third entries
refer to. I have given the second entry's numbers as those to be used
for Quart jars, and below I have reprinted the third entry on the
table, for an unknown jar size.
