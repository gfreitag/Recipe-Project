Helpful hints:

Ginger root is wonderful, but may not keep well in the refrigerator.
Keep it wrapped in plastic in the freezer and pull it out and grate
as you need it.  It will keep a long time and is still delicious.
Scallions are best, but regular onions will do in a pinch.

The original recipe called for Worchester sauce and soy sauce, but I
substitute all soy, because, as well all know, Worchester contains
anchovies. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
