6 ea Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sifted flour
12 1/2 oz Double dutch frosting mix
2 c  Walnuts or pecans
In large bowl, cream butter.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well
after each addition.  Gradually add sugar; beat at high speed until
light and fluffy.  By nad, stir in flour, dry frosting mix, and
wlanuts until well blended.  Bake in greased and floured 12 cup bundt
pan at 350 degrees F for 60 to 65 minutes. Since the cake has the
soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary doneness tests can not be used.  Test
after 60 minutes by observing a dry, shiny brownie-type crust.  Cool
30 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack or serving plate. Cake will
