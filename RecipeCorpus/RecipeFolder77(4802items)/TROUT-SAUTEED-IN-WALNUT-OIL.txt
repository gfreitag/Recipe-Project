Title: TROUT SAUTEED IN WALNUT OIL
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Walnuts
- broken OR pecans
4    Trout fillets
A little flour
Salt and pepper
2 tb Walnut oil
- OR hazelnut oil
2 tb Sherry
- OR red wine vinegar
Toast the nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan
often, for about 5 minutes.  Set aside. Wipe the skillet with paper
towels.

Dust the fish fillets with flour and shake off the excess. Heat just
enough oil to film generously the bottom of the skillet. Add the
fish, season with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat until
pale gold on both sides, turning once.  Remove the fish to a warm
dish. Pour the vinegar into the pan, stirring to melt any browned
bits, add the toasted nuts and spoon evenly over the fish.
