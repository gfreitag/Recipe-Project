1/4 c  Pine nuts
2    Eggs;slightly beaten
Matza meal*
3    Egg yolks
*Matzots and mastza meal may be bought in Jewish grocery stores and
many supermarkets *The recipe calls for cubes of turkey breast to be
ground; however I think a substitution of pre ground turkey would be
acceptable

Break matzot directly into a shallow bowl and pour broth over them.
In a large saucepan, place meat and oil and season with salt, pepper
and nutmeg. Add bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary and saute,
stirring frequently until meat is dark brown on all sides. (If dried
sage is used, enclose it in the cheesecloth with the rosemary.If you
using ground turkey, add garlic and bay leaf to this cheesecloth
bundle). Transfer meat to a dish to cool. Remove and discard bay
leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary. Add nuts to saucepan with oil and
saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain excess liquid from the matzot, but do
not squeeze dry. Add soaked matzot to the saucepan and turn heat off.
If using cubed turkey breast, grind it now and return to the
saucepan. Add beaten eggs and mix thoroughly. Oil a 9 inch cake pan
and sprinkle with matza meal. Pour meat mixture into it; level it
with a spatula. With a small ladle, make three depressions near the
centre and place 1 egg yolk in each depression. Bake in 375F oven for
1/2 hour.
