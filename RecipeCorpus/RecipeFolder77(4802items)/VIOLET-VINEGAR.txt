Title: VIOLET VINEGAR
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 2 Pints
4 c  Wild purple violets
4 c  Rice vinegar
Pack 2 pint jars tightly with the violets.  Pour the vinegar
(unheated) over the violets.  Cover tightly and allow to stand in a
sunny window for 4 or 5 days; the violets will bleach out and the
vinegar become a marvelous pale lavender.  Strain and keep
refrigerated.

NOTE:  The original recipe called for cider vinegar, but to capture
the delicate color and flavor of the violets, I use Japanese rice
vinegar, which is not as strong or as dark as cider vinegar.
