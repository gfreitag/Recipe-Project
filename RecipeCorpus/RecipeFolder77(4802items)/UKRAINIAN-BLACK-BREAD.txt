Title: UKRAINIAN BLACK BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------YIELD: 1 LOAF----------------------------
1 ts Active dry yeast
1/4 c  ;Water, warm (not hot!)
1 c  Coffee, STRONG; cooled
1 ts Blackstrap molasses
3 c  Whole rye flour
1/2 c  Whole buckwheat flour
1 1/4 ts Salt
Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water. Stir the molasses into the
coffee. Combine the dry ingredients. Mix in the wet ones and knead the
dough for 10-12 minutes. Cover the dough at this point in a bowl and
allow to sit for 2 hours. Take it out and knead again for 3-4
minutes. Shape into a round ball and and cover it for 30 minutes
more. Take the ball between your hands and roll it into a long thin
shape akin to the of a French bread loaf, approximately 2-3 inches in
diameter. Be sure to keep your hands wet when handling the dough at
all stages thus far. Grease a cookie sheet and place the dough upon
it. Proof the dough in a warm oven (about 85 degree F.) for 45
minutes. Bake in a 375 degree F moist oven (place 1 cup of water in a
metal bowl in the oven) for 20 minutes. Remove the water bowl and
continue to bake for 30 minutes more at 375 degrees F. This makes one
long loaf or it may be made into 2 shorter loaves or even into rolls.
