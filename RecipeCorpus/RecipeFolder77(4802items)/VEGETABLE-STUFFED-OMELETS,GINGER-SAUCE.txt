* Prepare vegetables by cutting the asparagus into 3-inch lengths, the
carrots into 3-inch sticks and green onions into 2-inch lengths. Shred
radishes  and slice cucumbers thin (optional ingredients) **Use
toasted walnuts or almonds, chopped In a large saucepan, cook
asparagus, carrots and green onions in a small amount of boiling,
lightly salted water for 7-9 minutes until crisp-tender; drain well.
Meanwhile for the sauce, stir together sweet-sour sauce, pineappple
or orange juice and grated ginger root (or 1/8 teaspoon ground
ginger) Set aside. For omelets, combine eggs and water in a small
bowl. Use fork to beat until combined but not frothy. In an 8-10 inch
skillet with flared sides, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil until a drop of
water sizzles.  Lift and tilt pan to coat all sides of skillet. Add
1/2 cup of egg mixture and cook over medium heat. As eggs set, run a
spatula around the edge of the skillet; lift eggs and let uncooked
portion flow underneath. When eggs are set but still shiny, transfer
to a warm plate, cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining egg
mixture and oil as needed to make 2 omelets. To assemble, spread some
of the sauce onto each omelet. Arrange steamed vegetables on one
quarter of each omelet, fanning vegetables to edge of omelets. Fold
each omelet over vegetables; fold again.  Top with additional sauce
and sprinkle with nuts. Jo Anne Merrill  recipe from my files.
