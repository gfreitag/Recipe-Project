In a saucepan over moderately low heat, melt butter and stir in
the onions.  Cover and cook slowly until the onions are transparent.
Blend in the flour. Stir slowly for 3 minutes, to cook the flour
without letting it color.  Remove from heat and, when bubbling stops,
pour in 1 cup of hot liquid all a once, whisking vigorously to blend
smoothly. Whisk in 6 more cups. Bring to a simmer, stirring, and
simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
The soup base should coat a spoon lightly; add dollops of more
liquid if too thick. Correct seasoning, and continue as your recipes
directs.

Makes about 2 quarts.

Suggestion:  Use with Upperline's Ancho Crab Soup or Flagon's Cream of
Mushroom and Brie Soup.
