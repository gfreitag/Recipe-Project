This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine,
the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form. All
these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92.
Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and
texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread,
each of which balances these assertive flavors.

Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and
Tabasco or cayenne.  Form into patties and grill until cooked
through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped
in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro.

Makes 4 servings.

NOTE: In the body of the accompanying article, the author suggests
using pita bread lightly spread with hoisin and putting the patties
into it along with some of the cabbage salad. That's probably the way
I'd go.
