Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM------------------WALDINE VAN GEFFEN VC42A-----------------------
2 c  Tomato juice
1/2 c  Canned tomato sauce
2 tb Olive oil
6 c  All-purpose flour; to 6-1/2
2 pk Active dry yeast
3 tb Brown sugar
1 ts Salt
3/4 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/4 ts Ground rosemary
1/4 ts Ground fennel
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
2 sm Cloves garlic; crushed
Lightly grease large bowl and 2 9x5x3" loaf pans with olive oil. Set
aside. In small saucepan, heat tomato juice, sauce and 2 tb olive oil
to 120~. In large mixer bowl, combine 3 cups flour with yeast and
remaining ingredients. Pour in tomato mixture and beat thoroughly for
3 minutes. Gradually add remaining 3 to 3-1/2 c flour, mixing by hand
if necessary until it holds together enough to turn out onto floured
surface. The dough is quite sticky and you may need to add a tad more
flour, but don't add an excessive amount or you will have a dry
bread. Knead about 5 minutes until dough smooths out. Place dough in
greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down, let rest 15 minutes, the shape into 2 loaves and
place in prepared pans. Cover pans and let dough rise an additional
45 minutes or until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 375~. Bake
loaves 10 minutes, reduce heat to 350~ and bake 30 to 40 minutes
more. Bread is done when loaves sound hollow when thumped with
knuckle. Tip loaves out immediately onto wire racks to cool. Source:
