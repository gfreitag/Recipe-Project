Title: YORGO'S TABOULI
Categories: Salads, Entrees, Grains
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Bulghur
1 1/2 c  Water, boiling
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Parsley, chopped (packed)
1/2 c  Green onions, chopped
1 ts Garlic, crushed (heaping)
1/4 c  Olive oil (little less)
1/4 c  Lemon juice (little less)
1/4 c  Feta cheese (1/3 pound)
Tomatoes, chopped
Garbanzos, to taste
Cover bulghur with boiling water.  Cover, let sit about 30 minutes
till all the water is gone.

Add salt, parsley, green onions (and/or scallions), garlic, lemon
juice and olive oil.  Add 2-3 large tomatoes and garbanzos. Top with
1/4 C feta.

Vicki's notes:

*  Bulghur is cracked wheat.  You can find it at health-food stores.
You can also find it in some grocery stores by other grains and pasta.

*  Can substitute scallions for some of the green onions. Some people
like to use mint instead of (or in addition to) the parsley. If you
use mint, might want to add chopped cucumber instead of tomato. Can
also add sliced avocado.

*  Some recipes call for soaking bulghur in more water and wringing
it out, but this leaves too much water!
