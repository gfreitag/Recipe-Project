Directions:

Prepare a non-metallic tub, preferably a wooden or glass (make sure
it's not polished since the vinegar will remove the wax polish)

1. Wash the mixing tub well. Dry with kitchen towel

2. Put cooked rice into mixing tub and spread evenly over the bottom
of mixing tub.

3. Sprinkle vinegar mixture generously over rice. You may not need
all of vinegar mixture. Do not add too much liquid.

4. With a large wooden spoon, mix rice with a slicing motion.

5. While you mix, use a hand or an electric fan. This is not to cool
sushi rice, but to puff the extra liquid away.

6. Keep sushi rice in the wooden tub, covered with a damp cloth.
