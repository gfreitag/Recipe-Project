Categories: Vegetables, Sept., Lacto
Yield: 1 Servings
1    (8-ounce) package
Medium-size egg noodles,
Uncooked
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1/4 c  Chopped green pepper
1/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
3 tb All-purpose flour
3 c  Milk
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 tb Poppy seeds
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Red pepper
3 c  Diced cooked tofu
1    (4-ounce) jar diced
Pimiento, drained
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Cook noodles according to package directions.  Drain well, and set
aside. Sauti onion and green pepper in butter in a Dutch oven until
tender; add flour, stirring until smooth. Cook 1 minute, stirring
constantly. Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until thickened and bubbly.  Stir in noodles, 1/4 cup
Parmesan cheese, poppy seeds, salt, red pepper, and tofu; add
pimiento, and stir gently. Spoon mixture into a lightly greased 12- x
8- x 2-inch baking dish. Cover and chill 8 hours. To bake, remove
from refrigerator, and let stand at room temperature 30 min. Bake,
covered, at 350 for 45 min. Uncover, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons
cheese. Bake, uncovered, an additional 10 min. or until thoroughly
heated.

1. I use one pound of tofu cut into 1 inch squares instead of turkey.
(I am a vegitarian.)

2. It does not have to refrigerate, but the tastes do mingle better
if it does.

3. I usually sprinkle more than 2 tablespoons of cheese on top.
