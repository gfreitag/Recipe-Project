electric mixer until well blended.  Beat in egg. 3. Combine flour,
salt, and baking soda. Mix into creamed mixture at low speed until
just blended. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts. 4. Drop rounded
tablespoonfuls of dough 3 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheet.
5. Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes for shewy cookies (they
