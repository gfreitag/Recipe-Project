Title: VEGETABLE SAUSAGE
Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
3 c  Mixed vegetables
- such as artichoke hearts,
- asparagus, mushrooms,
- broccoli or cauliflower
1 c  Cooked spinach; chopped
2 tb Olive oil
2 md Onions; roughly diced
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
3/4 c  Egg whites
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Minced garlic
1/2 ts Salt; or as desired
1/2 ts Ground white pepper
1 ts Fresh rosemary leaves -OR-
1/2 ts -Dried rosemary leaves
4    Feet sausage casing
ROUGHLY CHOP VEGETABLES into 1/4-inch pieces and set aside on a
plate. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the
onion and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Decrease heat to low, add
the vegetables and cook for 10 minutes. Remove vegetables from heat
and scrape the mixture into a food processor. Add the egg whites and
bread crumbs and puree until smooth. Stuff the mixture into sausage
casings or form 2 long sausages in plastic wrap. Poach the sausages
in gently simmering water for 7 minutes, drain and let cool. If you
have used plastic wrap to form the sausages, remove it when sausages
are cool. Cut sausages into 6-inch lengths. To serve, grill the
sausages or place under a preheated broiler. Since the sausages are
already cooked, we want only to reheat them and crisp their skins.
