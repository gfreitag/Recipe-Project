Butter in India is called makkhan.  Clarified butter, instead of being
called makkhan ghee, is called usli ghee (usli means "real" or "pure,"
which in this context refers to the real or original fat of the
ancient Indians).  Clarified butter or usli ghee is essentially
French brown butter with the brown residue strained off. Usli ghee
has a light caramel color and a heavenly aroma. Since there is no
moisture present, it keeps well covered, at room temperature, for
several months. (I keep it in the fridge .... I have no nerve.)

To make 3/4 cup clarified butter (usli ghee), place 1/2 pound (2
sticks) sweet, unsalted butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan (she
means frying pan) and put on a burner. Keep the heat low until the
butter melts completely, stirring often during the process. Increase
the heat to medium-low and let the butter simmer until it stops
crackling, thus inidicating that all the moisture has evaporated and
the milk residue is beginning to fry. As soon as the solids turn
brown (10-12 minutes), turn off the heat and take the pan off the
stove. Let the residue settle to the bottom of the pan, then strain
the clear butterfat (usli ghee) into another container. This usli
ghee, when it is completely cool, will turn a cream color. Ready-made
usli ghee is available in INdian grocery stores, but remember .....
there is no guarantee of its freshness or purity
