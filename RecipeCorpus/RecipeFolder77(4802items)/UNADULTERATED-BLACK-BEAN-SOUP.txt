This recipe is from Katherine Hall PAge's "The Body in the Cast" (St
Martin's Press, 1993, $19.95). It's from heroine Faith Fairchild's
cookbook, called "Have Faith in Your Kitchen." Faith notes that the
soup tastes better if made a day ahead.

Pick over beans, cover with cold water and bring to boil for 2
minutes. Remove from heat and let stand at least 1 hour. (Or soak
beans overnight, changing water several times.)

Drain beans and place in a large pot. Rinse the ham hocks. Peel and
quarter the onions. Bury hocks and onions in the beans. Add 7-8 cups
water and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer 1 1/2 to 2
hours. Be sure the beans are soft.

Remove the hocks or bone and strip any meat from them. Add the meat
to the soup and puree in batches in a blender. (Note: A food
processor sometimes leaks with this much liquid.) Put the pureed soup
in a clean pot; warm, adding the seasonings and wine, if using. Serve
with a dollop of sour cream and finely minced chives.
