Title: TOBACCO ONIONS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lg Red onion
1 lg Yellow Spanish onion
3 c  Unbleached flour
1 tb Cayenne pepper
1 tb Paprika
Salt & pepper to taste
5 c  Canola oil for frying
from Chef Dean Fearing at The Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas,
Texas. These onion rings have a decidedly Southwestern taste and a
browned, shrivelly appearance that led him to call them 'tobacco
onions' because of their resemblance to tobacco shreds.

Peel and slice the onions thinly, then separate into rings.

Mix the flour and the seasonings in a bowl.

Heat the canola oil in a deep, heavy pan or deep-fryer to about 350
degrees.

Dredge the onion rings in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess,
and fry until golden brown. Do small batches at a time so the rings
don't stick together, and don't dredge the rings until they're ready
to go into the oil or they'll give off too much moisture.

Drain on paper towels. Keep warm until the rest of the onions are
done. Serve immediately.
