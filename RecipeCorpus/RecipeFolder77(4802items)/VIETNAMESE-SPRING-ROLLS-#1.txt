Cook's notes: Tree ears, also called cloud ears, are dried fungi
that look like dried black chips. When soaked in water they expand 5
or 6 times their orginal size. Soak in warm water for 30 minutes;
drain and finely chop.
Procedure: Soak noodles in warm water for 20 minutes; drain and cut
into 1" lengths. Combine noodles with remaining filling ingredients
in a bowl and set aside. Cut a round rice-paper sheet into quarters.
Place cut paper on a flat surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten
eggs over the entire surface of each of the pieces. Before filling,
wait for the egg mixture to soften the wrappers; this takes about two
minutes. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1
tsp. of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.
Fold the sides over to enclose filling and continue to roll.
After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large, deep
frying pan or wok, put the rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to
moderate and fry 20 to 30 minutes until golden brown.
Presentation: Serve  hot. Serve spring rolls  on vegetable platterss
among lettuce, mint leaves, cilantro and cucumber slices. Also serve
with nuoc cham sauce if desired. Makes 80 spring rolls. Source:
