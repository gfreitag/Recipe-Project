Title: WHEAT THINS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 100 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2/3 c  Milk
Salt for the tops (opt.)
Preheat the oven to 325~ F. "Just the thing to nibble with a cup of
mulled wine or hot spiced apple cider, these simple, versatile
crackers also lend themselves beautifully to cheeses, dips, and spicy
spreads. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes In a large bowl or in the food
processor, combine the flours, sugar, and salt. Cut the butter into
the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in the milk
slowly, using only enough to form a dough that will hold together in
a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling.
On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll the crackers thin, 1/16 to
1/8 inch. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops with salt and gently
roll over the dough with your rolling pin. With a sharp knife, cut
the crackers into 2-inch squares. Transfer them to an ungreased
baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a
fork. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crackers are lightly
browned. Cool on a rack. Yield: 95-100.
