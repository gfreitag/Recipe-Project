Categories: Meats, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Onion; chopped
1 tb Minced garlic
10 tb Olive oil
2 lb Veal loin or leg roast
6 3/4 oz Canned tuna, drained
24    Anchovy fillets
1 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Water or chicken broth
1 ts Thyme leaves
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Ground white pepper
1/2 lb Dry pasta; such as:
- penne or small shells
2    Egg yolks
Salt to taste
1/4 c  Capers
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
COMBINE ONION, GARLIC and 1 tablespoon oil in a 2-quart pot. Place
over medium heat and cook, stirring, 5 minutes. Add veal, tuna, 6
anchovies, wine, broth, thyme, bay leaves and pepper. Cover, reduce
heat to low and cook for 45 to 50 minutes or until a meat thermometer
measures 135F. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool to room
temperature. Meanwhile, cook 1/2 pound dry pasta according to
directions. Drain, toss with 1 tablespoon oil and cool. Remove the
veal from the cooking liquid and boil liquid 5 minutes, or until
reduced by 1/2. Transfer contents of the pot to a bowl and let cool.
Remove bay leaves, transfer the contents to a food processor, add
yolks and blend until smooth. Continue to blend, adding the remaining
1/2 cup oil in a slow steady stream. When it's time to serve dinner,
toss the pasta with the capers, parsley and half of the sauce and
arrange on a large platter. Slice the veal very thinly and arrange
slices on the pasta. Spoon remaining sauce in a ribbon over the veal
and decorate with criss-crosses of anchovies.
