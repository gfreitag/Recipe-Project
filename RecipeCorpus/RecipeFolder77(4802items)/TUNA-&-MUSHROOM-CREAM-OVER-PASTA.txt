Categories: Pasta, Sauces, Low-cal
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Corn oil
4 md Shallots, chopped fine
2 md Garlic cloves, chopped fine
1/2 lb Button mushrooms, cut into
-1/4-inch slices
1 c  Evaporated nonfat milk
1 oz Grated parmesan cheese
1 cn White tuna in spring water,
Broken into chunks (6 1/2oz)
2 tb Fresh Italian parsley,
-finely chopped
1 tb Fresh chives, chopped fine
Freshly ground black pepper
Cooked pasta of your choice
In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the oil with the shallots and
garlic over moderate heat. When the vegetables sizzle, raise the heat
to high and add the mushrooms, sauteing just until they begin to
brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat and add the evaporated milk.
Simmer briskly, stirring frequently to guard against boiling over,
until the milk reduces by about a third, to a creamy consistency, 5
to 7 minutes. Stir in the parmesan cheese and, as soon as it melts,
fold in the tuna and herbs. Simmer just until the tuna is heated
through, then spoon over cooked pasta. Season with black pepper to
taste.
