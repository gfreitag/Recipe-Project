Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Servings:  1
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Amaretti, crushed (italian a
-mond macaroons)
1/2 c  Almonds, sliced and toasted
Dark chocolate sauce (see re
-ipe)
1 1/2 c  Chocolate wafer crumbs (abou
- 30 cookies)
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, melted
1 1/2 pt Coffee ice cream, slightly s
-ftened
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream, well chilled
In a bowl with a fork, stir together the crumbs and butter until the
mixture is well combined.  Pat the mixture onto the bottom and 1-inch up
the sides of a lightly oiled 8-inch, 2-1/2-inch deep springform pan. Freeze
crust for 30 minutes or until firm.  Spread ice cream evenly on the crust
and return to freezer for 30 minutes or until ice cream is firm.

In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat cream with vanilla until it holds
stiff peaks, fold in amaretti thoroughly and spread over ice cream. Smooth
top of cake, sprinkle with almonds, and freeze cake for 30-45 minutes, or
until top is firm.

Freeze cake, covered with plastic wrap and foil, overnight.  Just before
serving, wrap a warm damp towel around the side of the pan, remove side of
pan, and transfer cake to a serving plate.  Cut into wedges with a knife
dipped in hot water and serve it with the Dark Chocolate Sauce.
