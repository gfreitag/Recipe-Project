Title: Gourmet's chicken tetrazzini
Categories: Chicken, Italian
Servings:  4
1 c  Heavy cream
3 tb Medium dry sherry
Nutmeg to taste
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
4 lb Chicken, cut in pieces
1/2 lb Mushrooms, thinly sliced
5 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 lb Spaghetti
2 tb Flour
In a kettle, combine the chicken with enough salted water to cover it by 2
inches.  Bring water to a boil, and simmer the chicken for 20 minutes or
until it is tender.  Let chicken cool in the broth, separate the meat from
the skin and bones, returning the skin and bones to the broth. Cut the meat
into strips and reserve.  Simmer the broth until it is reduced by half,
strain through a fine sieve, discarding the solids. Skim off fat. Boil the
stock until it is reduced to about 2 cups.

Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook the mushrooms in 2 Tbsp butter over
mod-low heat, stirring, until they are softened.  In a kettle of boiling
salted water, cook spaghetti until it is al dente.  Drain it well. In a
saucepan melt remaining butter over mod-low heat.  Add flour and cook the
roux, stirring, for 3 minutes. Whisk in the reserved broth, cream and
Sherry.  Bring the sauce to a boil, whisking, and simmer it for 5 minutes.
Season with nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste.

Stir half into the mushrooms with the spaghetti and transfer it to a
well-buttered 2-1/2-qt. baking dish, making a well in the center. Add the
chicken meat to the remaining sauce, combine well.  Spoon this into the
center of the spaghetti and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the
middle of a preheated 350f oven for 25-30 minutes or until pale golden in
color.  Serve immediately.
