Title: Chapatis (roti)
Categories: Breads, Indian
Servings: 10
1/2 c  Water approximately
1/4 ts Salt (optional)
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
2/3 c  Unbleached all purpose flour
Make up the dough approximately 1/2-hour before you need it. Allow the
dough to rest about 10 minutes. Pinch off portion of dough to form a ball
about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Roll ball flat on lightly floured surface.
Pat back and forth between hands until thin. (Patting makes the chapati
puff when baked.)

Cook on top of the stove on ungreased griddle until browned and puffed. Use
medium heat so the griddle does not get too hot.
