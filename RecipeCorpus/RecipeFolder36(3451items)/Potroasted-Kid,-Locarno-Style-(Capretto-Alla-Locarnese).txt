Title: Potroasted Kid, Locarno Style (Capretto Alla Locarnese)
Categories: West europe, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Dried mint, or
1 tb Fresh mint
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Nutmeg (fresh if poss.)
1 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Heavy cream
1 tb Rum
2 lb Boneless kid or lamb
Salt
Pepper
3 tb Butter
1 1/2 ts Ground sage, or
2 1/2 ts Fresh sage
6    Juniper berries, crushed
Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle the meat with the salt
and pepper.  Heat the butter in a casserole, and add the sage, juniper
berries, mint, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Cook, stirring constantly, for 3
minutes.  Add the meat and brown on all sides.  Lower the heat and
add the wine.  Simmer, covered, until the meat is tender (it took me
a little more than an hour with the kid I had).  Remove the meat and
keep warm.  Strain the sauce.  Put the sauce back in the casserole,
and stir in the cream and rum.  Bring to a boil and reduce to the
consistency of heavy cream. Return the meat to the sauce and heat
through.  Serve with dry boiled rice and green peas.  (it says here:
but I served it with wide homemade egg noodles, and I think that
works better than rice would, even if not strictly the way they would
do it in Locarno.)
