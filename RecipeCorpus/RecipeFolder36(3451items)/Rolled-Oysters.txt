Title: Rolled Oysters
Categories: Main dish, Appetizers, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 3 servings
Shortening for frying
1 tb Baking powder
1    Well beaten egg
1 c  White corn meal
18 md Oysters, drained
1/2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
Sift the flour, baking powder and salt.  Beat the egg and milk and
add to make a batter.  It should be stiff.  Beat smooth.  Put all the
oysters in this & coat them well.  Take up 3 batter coated oysters at
a time and form them in the hand in a croquette.  Quickly roll them
in the meal, covering them completely.  Coat the second time, putting
them back in the batter & again in the meal.  Deep fry oysters in
your deep fryer at 375 degrees. Lower heat as soon as they go in.  Do
not cook too quickly.  Cook the oysters for about 3 or 4 minutes
until heated throughout and the crust is visibly brown.  Serve with
tartar sauce or use a favorite cocktail sauce if you have one.
