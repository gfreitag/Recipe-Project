MMMMM------------------REDUCED-FAT CARROT CAKE-----------------------
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Prune puree (see below)
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Grated carrots (5-6 small)
8 oz Crushed pineapple, (8 oz)
- thoroughly drained
Frosting (see below)
1/4 c  Walnuts
2 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
2 ts Cinnamon
2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Bakeing soda
1 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs
2 lg Egg whites
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
12 oz Low-fat cream cheese,
- softened
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat inside of three 9-inch round
layer-cake pans with non-stick cooking spray.  Line the bottoms with
wax paper and set aside.
Spread walnuts in a pie plate and bake for 8 to 10 minutes at 350
degrees, or until fragrant.  Let cool; chop coarsely.
Toasting the walnuts brings out their nutty flavor, and means you
don't need to use as many as in traditional recipes.
In a medium-sized bowl, stir together flour, cinnamon, baking powder,
baking soda and salt.  In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and egg
whites.  Add sugar, prune puree and oil and whisk until smooth.  Add
the flour mixture to the egg mixture and stir with a wooden spoon
until blended.  Stir in carrots, pineapple and the toasted walnuts.
Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 35
minutes at 350 degrees, or until a cake tester inserted in the center
comes out clean. Let cool for 5 minutes in the pan on a rack.  Loosen
edges and invert cakes onto racks.  Peel off paper and let cool
completely. TO MAKE PRUNE PUREE:  In a food processor, combine 6
ounces (1 cup) pitted prunes with 6 tablespoons hot water; process
until smooth.  Makes 1 cup. One cup of prune puree contains 407
calories and 1 gram of fat; a cup of butter contains 1,600 calories
and 182 grams of fat; and a cup of oil contains 1,944 calories and
218 grams of fat. FROSTING
In a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and vanilla; beat with
an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
TO ASSEMBLE CAKE:  Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate.  Spread a
scant 1/2 cup of frosting over it.  Top with another cake layer and
spread another scant 1/2 cup frosting.  Place third layer on top and
spread with remaining frosting.  Serves 16.
