Collected from posts on GEnie Food & Wine RT by COOKIE-LADY, and
posts on Fido Cooking echo by BOB EMERT, Dale & Gail Shipp, and ERIC
DECKER. Special thanks to ANNE MACLELLAN for actually comparing her
set of Australian measures. You will probably notice that some items
have more than one equivalent amount given; if sources disagreed, and
I haven't tested myself, I've included both.
