Categories: Relishes
Yield: 4 cups
2    Allspice Berries -OR-
1/8 ts Ground Allspice
1    Stick Cinnamon -OR-
1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
1/4 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Dark Brown Sugar
1/2 c  Raspberry Vinegar
1 pn Salt
12 oz Pkg fresh Cranberries
1/2    Pineapple (Fresh) -OR-
1 sm Can of canned Pineapple
1    1" long piece of fresh
-Ginger Root
1 sm Hot Chili Pepper
1 md Lemon
2    Whole Cloves (opt)
1.  Rinse and pick over  Cranberries, discarding stems
or blemished berries.  Peel, core and finely chop the
Pineapple.  Peel and grate or mince the Ginger.  Seed
and mince the Chili.  Remove two strips of zest from
the lemon with a vegetable peeler and extract the
juice from the fruit.  Tie the Lemon zest and spices
(if using whole spices) in  a piece of cheesecloth, or
just add them to the pot.

2.  Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.  Because of
the Cranberry's high acidity, they should not be
placed in an aluminum or cast iron pan. Bring to a
boil.  Reduce heat and simmer the chutney for 8-10
minutes, or until the Cranberries begin to pop.
Correct the seasonings, adding more sugar, vinegar and
lemon juice as needed; the Chutney should be a little
sweet a little sour and a little spicy.  Refrigerate
at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.  Remove the
cheesecloth bundle.
