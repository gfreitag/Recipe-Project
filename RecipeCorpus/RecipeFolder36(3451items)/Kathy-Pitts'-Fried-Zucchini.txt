Title: Kathy Pitts' Fried Zucchini
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 batch  First, cut the squash (we use zucchini, but yellow crookneck should
work, too) in coin-like slices about 1/4 inch thick.

Place the squash in a deep pan, and pour evaporated milk over it.

Swish the squash around a bit until all pieces are well coated with
milk.

Now, place a thin layer of breading (any commercial breading mix will
work, or your favorite breading mix containing flour, seasonings, and
cornmeal will do well) in a fairly deep, rimmed pan.

Carefully lay one layer of squash slices on the breading.  Cover with
another thin layer of breading, layer on more squash, more breading,
etc., until all squash is used.

Cover this mess, and refrigerate for AT LEAST 15 minutes (30 minutes
is better).  Remove the squash from the breading mixture, being
careful not to disturb the crumb coating.

Drop into hot deep fat, and fry until well browned.

Drain, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve with either Marinara
sauce (bottled Ragu or something similar is fine) or Ranch dressing
as a dip.
