Title: Swordfish Steaks with Middle eastern Flavors
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Lemon juice
1    Garlic clove(s), minced
1 ts Turmeric
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground cumin seeds
Salt and pepper to taste
2    (8oz) swordfish steaks
About 3/4" thick
2 tb Parsley, finely chopped
1    (to 2) minced jalapeno
Or other hot peppers (opt)
4 ts Canola or vegetable oil
Place swordfish steaks in a shallow glass dish. In a  small bowl,
combine all the remaining ingredients. Spread mixture over both sides
of fish. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill. Once the fire is at
medium heat, grill the steaks for 4-5 min per side. The flesh should
be opaque. Remove form the grill. Cut each steak into 2 portions and
serve.

Diane's Note: I don't see why this couldn't be prepared in the
broiler.
