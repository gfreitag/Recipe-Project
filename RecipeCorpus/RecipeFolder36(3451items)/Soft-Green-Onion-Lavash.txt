Title: Soft Green Onion Lavash
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Scallion tops -- finely
Sliced
3 c  Bread flour
2 ts Yeast
1 c  Water -- plus 3 tbsp
2 tb Shortening
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
Add ingredients and program for knead and first rise.  When done,
remove, punch down and let rest for 5 minutes.  Position oven rack on
lowest position.  Preheat oven and 13 x 9 pan to 425 at least 30
minutes before you plan to bake the lavash.  Cut dough into 2 equal
pieces.  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough into 2
1/4" thick, free form ovals. Place on preheated baking pan sprinkled
lighly with flour.  Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes or until lavash
puffs up and is a light golden brown. Lavash should be soft.  Do not
overbake or lavash will become crisp. Place hot baked lavash in a
large, clean, brown paper bag.  Fold over top to seal.  As lavash
cools it will remain soft.
