Title: BRAISED CREAMY GARLIC DRESSING
Categories: Dress/stuff
Yield: 1 batch
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Sour cream
Salt
Pepper, white
6 md Garlic clove
1 lg Egg
2 ts Dijon mustard
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  Peanut oil
Place garlic in a small saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a
boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove from heat, strain, and cool to room
temperature.  Or, if you have the time, rub garlic cloves with 1 tbsp
butter and roast in a 350 degree oven until tender, about 20 to 30
minutes.  Remove outer skin.  In bowl of blender or food processor
fitted with a steel blade, combine garlic, egg, mustard, and lemon
juice.  Process 15 seconds, or until smooth.  With machine running,
slowly drizzle in oils in a very thin stream until thickened.  Scrape
into a bowl.  Whisk in sour cream and season with salt and pepper to
taste.  Chill until serving.

For a variation, toss with finely grated celeriac or use on a spinach
or green salad.
