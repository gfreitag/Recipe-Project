Title: Creme Caramel
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
2 lg Eggs
4 lg Egg whites
1 tb Pure vanilla extract
1/2 c  Sugar plus
1/3 c  Sugar
1 c  Skim milk
1 c  Evaporated skim milk
Preheat oven to 325 F.

In a small heavy saucepan, combine  1/2 cup sugar with 1/3 cup water.
Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. Increase heat
to medium-high and cook, without stirring, until the syrup turns a
deep amber color, 5-7 min. Watch carefully so that it does not burn.
Carefully pour caramel into six 3/4-cup ramekins and tilt the
ramekins to coat the bottom and sides evenly.

Let saucepan cool for a minute or so, then add the milk and
evaporated skim milk to the caramel coating the saucepan. Bring to a
simmer, stirring to dissolve the caramel. Remove from the heat.

In a medium bowl, lightly whisk eggs, egg whites, 1/3 cup sugar and
vanilla. Gradually whisk the milk mixture into the egg mixture.
Divide the custard mixture into the caramel-lined ramekins. Skim off
any bubbles. Place the ramekins in a roasting or baking pan. Pour hot
water two-thirds of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for
25-30 min, or until a knife inserted in the center of the custard
comes out clean. Transfer the ramekins to a rack and cool. Cover and
refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour or for up to 2 days.

To serve, run the tip of a small knife around the edge of the mold and
invert onto a plate.
