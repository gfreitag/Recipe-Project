Beau's notes:

*  There are no "jalapeno beans;" there are jalapeno peppers and pinto
beans.  I have two recipes, both of which are quite tref, but a
Catholic should worry?  But if you are hosting a Jewish person,
smoked turkey will substitute most agreeably for the chazer called
for in either recipe.]
