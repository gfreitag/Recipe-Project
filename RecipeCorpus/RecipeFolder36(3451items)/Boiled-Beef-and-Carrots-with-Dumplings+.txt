Categories: Meats, Vegetables, British isl
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM----------------------------MEAT---------------------------------
-1" in diameter (about 1 lb)
12 sm Scraped carrots
3 1/2 lb Corned beef brisket (lean)
-rolled and tied
18    Peeled white onions, about
MMMMM-------------------------DUMPLINGS------------------------------
-chopped and thoroughly
-chilled (about 3 tb.)
1/3 c  Milk
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Double acting baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 oz Fresh beef suet, finely
Place the brisket in a 5 to 6 qt stovetop casserole, and add enough
water to cover it by at least 1/2". Bring to a boil over high heat,
meanwhile skimming off scum amd foam as they rise to the surface.
Reduce the heat, partially cover the casserole, and simmer for 2 1/2
hours. Then add the onions and carrots, and cook partially covered
for another 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the
meat shows no resistance where pierced with a fork.

DUMPLINGS: Meanwhile preheat the oven to 250 degrees and make the
dumpling mixture. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large
bowl. Add the suet and working quickly, rub the flour and fat
together with your fingertips until they look like flakes of coarse
meal. Pour the milk over the mixture, toss together lightly, and
gather the dough into a ball. If the dough crumbles, add up to 2 more
tb. of milk, a drop or two at time, until the particles adhere. with
lightly floured hands, shape the dough into 1" balls.

With a slotted spoon, remove the meat and vegetables from the stock,
and arrange them on a large heated platter. Cover and keep them warm
in the oven. Drop the dumplings into the stock remaining in the
casserole, sirring gently once or twice. Cook uncovered over moderate
heat for 15 minutes, or until the dumplings rise to the surface.
Transfer the dumplings to the platter of beef and vegetables, and
serve at once, accompanied (if you like) by Pease Pudding (proceeding
recipe.)
