Title: NAPA KIMCHEE (JEFF SMITH, THE FRUGAL GOURMET)
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Garlic, finely chopped
2 tb Candied ginger
2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Korean red pepper flakes
1 tb Salt
6 lb Napa cabbage
3/4 c  Korean pickling salt or
8    Scallions, finely chopped
Kosher salt
1 1/2 c  Carrot, shredded
2 tb Fresh ginger, grated
So many crazy stories have been told about Kimchee that many
Americans are reluctant to try the dish. No, it is not buried in the
ground in this country, and yes, it is delicious and much milder than
you would expect. You can vary the spiciness by varying the amount of
red pepper that you put into the dish. Wonderful stuff !!
Remove limp outer leaves from the cabbage. Quarter the cabbage
lengthwise, then cut across the quarters into 1 1/2 inch-wide pieces.
Put the cabbage in a very large bowl and add the pickling salt. Toss
so the salt coats the cabbage evenly. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.
Toss the cabbage a couple of times during that time. Rinse the
cabbage with cold water and drain. Toss with the remaining
ingredients and pack into a large crock or covered pottery casserole.
Add water to cover, about 3 cups. Allow to sit on the counter for 1
to 2 days. Store in the refrigerator, covered, in the crock or in
individual glass jars. Serve as a relish with any Korean dinner or
use in cooking meat or soup dishes.
