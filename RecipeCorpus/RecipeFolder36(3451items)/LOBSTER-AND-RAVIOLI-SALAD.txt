Plunge live lobsters headfirst into large pot of rapidly boiling
water and cook for 12 to 16 mins. Remove and drain. When cooked,
remove the tail and claws of each lobster. For this recipe, use only
the tail meat and save the claw meat for garnish. Pound the basil and
salt with a pestle to a fine paste. Add oil, drop by drop, stirring
until well blended. Add small amount of freshly milled pepper. Spread
out 24 wonton wrappers on a floured board and place a small amt. of
both cheese in the center of each wrapper. Brush the edges of
wrappers with warm water and top with another wrapper to form a
ravioli. Repeat this process until you have 24 filled ravioli. Crimp
the edges or cut into rounds with a cookie cutter (about the size of
a half dollar. Transfer to a steamer and steam for 2 minutes. DRain
the ravioli and set aside. Slice the lobster tails into 1/2 inch
rounds and combine with 3/4 of the basil dressing in a large bowl.
Allow to marinate for 15 minutes.  Divide the lettuces and artichokes
among four dinner plates and carefully spoon the rest of the basil
dressing on top of each plate. Arrange the lobster rounds on top of
the lettuces and surround with ravioli. Sprinkle with
