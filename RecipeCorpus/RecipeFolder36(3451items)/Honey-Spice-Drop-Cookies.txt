Title: Honey Spice Drop Cookies
Categories: Companion, Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 36 cookies
1/4 ts Cloves
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Soda
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Shortening
2 1/4 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 ts Allspice
Boil honey and shortening together for 1 minute.  Cool and add dry
ingredients, sifted together.  Cool dough in the refrigerator until
firm. You can either drop it by teaspoons on a lightly greased baking
sheet, or shape into a roll and slice.  Bake at 350 F. for 8 to 10
minutes.  Remove from pans immediately.

Dill writes: "These are so easy to make that I fill the cookie jar
with them often.  You can use freshly ground spices instead of the
canned ones, you'll see a big difference."
