Echo
Any quick bread type cake
-can be baked in canning
-jars. (See recipes I have
Copied for Rhonda Roman, I
a month or so ago.) Bake one jar first++you want to see how high the
batter rises, then go from there. You don't want the cake to come out
of the top of
the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the lip of the jar.
Write it down
on your recipe so you'll know how high to fill them in the future.
Most of the
recipes tried take 8 jars. Sterilize as many jars as you'll think
you'll need
and go from there. Make sure your LIDS are new, the rings don't have
to be. The
cakes sealed this way will be as moist as the day you baked them.
Sometimes more so. The baking times will vary ++ the moistness of
each cake recipe will
determine the time. MOST of the recipes bake in 35 to 40 min. Start
checking
the cakes at 25 to 30 min. and go from there.
Yes the cakes DO slide easily out of the jars IF you use Ball 12 oz.
Quilted
Crystal Canning Jars (#14400-81400). They can be found at most grocery
stores
next to the pectin and other canning supplies. Plain straight-sided
jars work
well, but are not as pretty and you have to make your own labels++the
jars recommended come with decorative labels. Get your jars now! They
will be gone
soon as the holiday approaches. They are NOT cheap. . . so you may
want to ask
folks for them back, and they will want them refilled! (grin)
There will be a little condensation on the lids and some in the jars
so when
you seal them it's trapped inside. Don't worry about getting the
water off of
the lids before placing them onto the jars, the added moisture
doesn't hurt the
cakes in the slightest. Quick bread-type cakes work best, lighter
cakes tend
to
fall when sealed. Jar lids and rings should be boiled for 15 minutes
and left
