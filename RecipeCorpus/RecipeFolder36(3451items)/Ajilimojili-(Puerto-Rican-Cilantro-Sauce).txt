Pronounced a-He-lee-mo-He-lee. Traditionally served over fried mashed
green plantains and boiled vegetables. Goes great with grilled
seafood, vegetables, and especially grilled meats.

Puree the onions, garlic, peppers, cilantro, culentro, and oregano in
a food processor. Add the olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and
puree until smooth. Correct the seasoning, adding more salt or
vinegar to taste.

The sauce can also be made in the blender; add all the ingredients at
once.

Transfer the sauce to clean glass jars. Refrigerated, it will keep for
several weeks.

Note: Cachucha peppers are tiny, pattypan squash-shaped peppers that
hint at the floral fragrance of the Scotch bonnet but without the
heat. Culentro or chandon beni, is a flat, thumb-shaped,
sawtooth-edged herb that tastes like strong cilantro with a slightly
bitter aftertaste. Look for them at Hispanic or West Indian markets.
