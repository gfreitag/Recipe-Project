Categories: Holiday, Poultry
Yield: 16 servings
1/4 c  Carrots; finely chopped
1/4 c  Celery; finely chopped
1/4 c  Turnip; finely chopped
3 cl Garlic; thinly sliced
12 lb Turkey; thawed to room temp
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Onions; finely chopped
Preheat the oven to 325ø. Sprinkle turkey inside and out with salt and
pepper. Tuck wings under turkey. Place turkey in an oven roasting bag.
Scatter onions, carrots, celery, turnip and garlic over and around
turkey. Fold the top of the bag over and place turkey, breast up. in
a small roasting pan. Add 1 in. water.

Roast turkey 3 to 3 1/2 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted in
the thickest part of the leg (but not touching the bone) reaches 165ø
to 170ø. Carefully tear open and remove the bag. Increase the oven
temperature to 450ø. Roast 30 minutes longer, or until the thermometer
registers 180ø, basting with the pan juices every 5 minutes. Turkey
should be golden brown.

Remove the roasting pan from the oven and carefully transfer turkey
to a platter, letting the juices run back into the pan; reserve the
juices for gravy. Cover the bird with foil and let stand for 20
minutes before carving. (In the meantime, make gravy.) Makes about 16
servings.
