Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Sugar
Dash of nutmeg
3/4 c  Apricot preserves
1    Egg yolk
1/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
1 c  Milk
3    Egg yolks
1 tb Butter or margarine
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 lb Tart cooking apples
Prepare crust and roll out 2/3rds of the pastry to form a 12 inch
circle. Use to line a 9 inch pie plate; refrigerate with rest of
pastry. Make filling: In small saucepan combine 1/3 cup sugar and the
flour; mix well. Stir in milk.  Bring to boiling, stirring; reduce
heat; simmer, stirring until slightly thickened - 1 minute. In a
small bowl, beat 3 egg yolks slightly.  Beat in a little of hot
mixture; pour back into saucepan, beating to mix well.  Stir in 1
tablespoon butter and the vanilla. Turn into bowl to cool. Core,
pare, and slice apples; sprinkle with lemon juice. In medium skillet,
heat butter with sugar and nutmeg.  Add apple slices; saute, stirring
occasionally, until partially cooked - about 5 minutes. Remove from
heat.  Heat apricot preserves just until melted. Preheat oven to
425F. Turn filling into pie shell, spreading evenly. Arrange apple
slices on top, mounding slightly in center. Spread with apricot
preserves. Roll out rest of pastry to form a 10-inch circle.  With
knife or pastry wheel, cut into 12 strips 1/2" wide. Slightly moisten
rim of pie shell with cold water.  Arrange 6 stips across filling;
press ends to rim of pie shell, trimming off ends if necessary.
Arrange rest of strips at right angle to first strips, to form a
lattice. Bring overhang of pastry up over ends of strips; crimp edge.
Mix yolk with a tablespoon of water; use to brush lattice strips, not
edge. On lowest shelf of oven, bake 35-40 minutes, or until pastry is
golden. Cool. Serve slightly warm.
