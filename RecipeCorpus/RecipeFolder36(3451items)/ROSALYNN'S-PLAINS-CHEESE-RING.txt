"One of Mrs. Carter's favorite recipes was for a simple cheddar cheese
mold.Served in a ring to be spread on crackers, the cheese appetizer
was prepared for many of the Carter's family dinners and some of
their official functions. One unusual ingredient was the strawberry
preserves served in the centre of the ring."

In a mixing bowl, combine cheese with mayonnaise, chopped nuts and
onions. Mix in black pepper and cayenne, and blend thoroughly. Press
in a 3 cup mold. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. To serve, dip mold
into a pan of hot water for 15 to 20 seconds before turning out onto
a serving platter. Fill centre with strawberry preserves, and serve
at once with whole grain crackers or melba toast.
