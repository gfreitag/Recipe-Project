" A delicious, thick, creamy, crab soup from Scotland. Partan is the
Gaelic word for crab and bree from brigh, which means broth.
Bring the milk almost to the boiling point in a heavy-bottomed
saucepan. Add the rice and anchovy fillets. Simmer until the rice is
well done. Remove from heat and add the crabmeat.
Puree the soup in a blender or food processor. Return the pureed
soup to a large saucepan and gradually stir into hr stock. Season
with salt and pepper to taste. Add the cream just before serving.
N.B. This soup can be served either hot or cold. For some reasons, it
always seems to taste better hot.
