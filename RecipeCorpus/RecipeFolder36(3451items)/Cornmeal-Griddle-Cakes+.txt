Title: Cornmeal Griddle Cakes+
Categories: Breakfast, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 dozen
2 c  Buttermilk
3    Egg yolks, lightly beaten
6 tb Butter, melted and cooled
3    Egg whites
1 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Unsifted flour
1 ts Double-acting baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
Combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt, and sift them
together into a deep-bowl. Stir in the buttermilk with a wooded
spoon and, when it is completely incorporated, add the egg yolks and
2 tb. of the melted, cooled butter.

With a wire whisk or a rotary or electric beater, beat the egg
whites in a separate bowl until they are stiff enough to stand in
unwavering peaks on the beater when it is lifted from the bowl.
Scoop the egg whites over the cornmeal mixture and with a rubber
spatula, fold   them together gently but thoroughly.

Warm a large heavy griddle over moderate heat until a drop of water
flicked onto it splutters and evaporates instantly. Grease the
griddle lightly with a pastry brush, dipped in the remaining 4 tb.
of   butter. To form each griddle cake, pour 1/4 cup of the batter on
the   griddle, leaving enough space between them so that they can
spread into 4" rounds. Fry 3 or 4 cakes at a time for about 3 minutes
on each side, or until they are golden and crisp around the edges.

As they brown, arrange the griddle-cakes on a heated plate. Then
repeat the procedure, brushing the griddle with melted butter when
necessary, until all the cakes are fried. Serve the cornmeal griddle
cakes at once with butter and maple syrup.
