Title: SIZZLING RICE SOUP #2 (CHICKEN)
Categories: Soup/stew, Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings    1 c  Long grain rice
1 c  Water
1    Whole chicken breast
3 T  Cornstarch
3 T  Water
1 T  Soy sauce
6 c  Chicken stock
2 c  Shredded watercress, OR
2 c  Lettuce OR spinach, shredded
1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions
1 t  Dark sesame oil (opt)
Salad oil for deep frying

Preparation: Skin, bone and cut the chicken breast into julienne
strips.

Rice: In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, combine rice and water
over high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium and
cook 10 minutes. Drop heat to low and cook for an additional 30
minutes without removing the lid. The crusty rice around the sides
and bottom will stick to the pan. This will be used in the soup. Take
off the top layer of softer rice and reserve for another use. Lift
out the crusty rice and place on a cookie sheet to dry at room
temperature, or place in a glass baking dish in a microwave oven for
10 minutes on low. If the rice is dried at room temperature, allow
12-24 hours before deep frying.

Soup: Toss the strips of chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the
cornstarch. Set aside. In a small container, combine remaining 2
tablespoons of cornstarch with water and soy sauce. Heat stock just to
boiling. Stir in soy mixture and chicken. Simmer 5 minutes. Add the
shredded greens, onions and sesame oil, if desired. Keep the soup hot
(but not boiling) while frying rice. Heat oil to 375 degrees in a
deep-fryer or heavy saucepan. Fry rice 3 to 5 minutes until puffed
and lightly browned. Be watchful, because it can burn quickly. Lift
rice out of the fat with a slotted spoon. Drain the rice on paper
towels and place in a heated tureen or individual bowls. Pour in the
soup. Serve at once. Additional fried rice may be passed during the
course.
