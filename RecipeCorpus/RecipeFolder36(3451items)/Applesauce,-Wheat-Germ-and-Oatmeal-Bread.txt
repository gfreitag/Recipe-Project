Title: Applesauce, Wheat Germ and Oatmeal Bread
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 1/2lb loaf
2 ts Gluten
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ginger [opt'l]
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1 1/2 c  Applesauce
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Oatmeal*
1/4 c  Wheat Germ
1/4 c  Oat bran
The combination of oatmeal, wheatgerm and applesauce is deadly!

* Grind oatmeal into a coarse flour before adding to the dough pail.

Add the solid and liquid ingredients and the yeast in order according
to the machine's manufacturer.

Be on hand to observe the first mixing cycle and add flour or water as
needed as the moisture content of applesauce varies dramatically from
batch to batch.

Because of the applesauce this bread needs no sugar or butter/oil.
