The combination of cabbage & noodles pleases the palate. In preparing
this dish, I recommend sauteeing the cabbage & onions, separately.
This method brings out the flavor of each food.

Saute the cabbage in 1 tbsp of corn oil about 15 minutes. Set aside.
In a separate pan, saute onions and garlic, along with the salt,
pepper and paprika in the remaining corn oil. Cook until the onions
are translucent . Stir the onions and cabbage together. Add the
cooked noodles and reheat. Serve hot, garnished with parsley.
