Title: SWEET RISOTTO WITH EXOTIC BANANAS
Categories: Desserts, Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Brown sugar
3 c  Milk
1/4 c  Creme de cacao liqueur
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Arborio rice
3    Exotic ripe bananas (about
1 1/3 lb Total weight), peeled and
Chopped
Sprinkle about a third of the rice in the bottom of a 2-quart
casserole dish.  Then sprinkle on a third of the bananas and a third
of the sugar on top of them.  Continue sprinkling in thirds until
you're done. Pour on the milk and creme de cacao and sprinkle with
cinnamon.  Cover and bake in a 375 degree pre-heated oven until the
liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 1 hour.  Serve
warm.

We discovered that it also tastes good cold, standing in front of the
refrigerator :-)

You can substitute skim milk or evaporated skim milk instead of whole
milk. Also, if exotic bananas aren't available,  substitute regular
ones.   I used evaporated skim milk, regular bananas, and I think I
left out the liqueur.  Arborio is the short-grained Italian rice
traditionally used for risotto.  My regular supermarket does carry
it.  Perhaps another kind of rice would work.
