Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 tea ring
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1/4 c  Shortening
3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
-- (plus more as necessary)
1    Egg; beaten
1 c  Quaker Oats, uncooked
-- (quick or old-fashioned)
1    Cake compressed yeast; or...
1 pk -Dry yeast
1/4 c  Lukewarm water
3/4 c  Milk; scalded
1/4 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1 ts Salt

1 ts Lemon juice
1/4 c  Sugar
12 oz Dried apricots
2 c  Water
For dough, soften yeast in lukewarm water.  (Use warm water for dry
yeast.)  Pour scalded milk over sugar, salt and shortening.  Cool to
lukewarm.  Stir in 1 cup flour and egg.  Add softened yeast and oats.
Stir in enough more flour to make a soft dough.

Turn out on lightly floured board or canvas; knead until smooth and
satiny; about 10 minutes.  Round dough into ball; place in greased
bowl; brush lightly with melted shortening.  Cover and let rise in
warm place until double in size, about 1 hour.

While dough is rising, prepare filling.  For filling, combine
apricots, water, lemon juice and sugar in medium-sized saucepan.
Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until thickened.  Cool.

Punch dough down; cover; let rest 10 minutes.  Roll to form an
18x12-inch rectangle.  Brush with melted butter; spread with filling.
Starting with long side, roll up as for jelly roll.  Form into circle
on greased cooky sheet, sealed edge down.  Make cuts 2/3 of way
through ring at 1-inch intervals.  Turn one section to left and next
to right. Repeat around ring. [Cut edges showing a spiral of filling
will be exposed, and parallel with the work surface. --K.M.]  Brush
lightly with melted shortening.

Cover; let rise in warm place until nearly double in size, about 45
minutes.  Bake in preheated moderate oven (350 F.) 20 to 25 minutes.
Drizzle with confectioner's sugar frosting while still warm.  Makes
one large tea ring.
