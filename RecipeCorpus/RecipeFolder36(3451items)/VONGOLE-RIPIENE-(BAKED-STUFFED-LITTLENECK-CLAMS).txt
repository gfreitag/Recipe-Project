Inspect the clams and discard any clam that is not completely closed
or doe not close when dropped into cold water.  Open the clams,
loosen each one fr its shell, and reserve its liquid.  Discard the
top shells.  Place clams on the half shell on a baking sheet. Combine
the breadcrumbs, oregano, parsley cheese, olive oil, 2 tablespoons of
the wine, and salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle a generous
amount of the stuffing over the top of each clam. Strain the reserved
clam juice and sprinkle it over the stuffing.  Pour the remaining 2
tablespoons of wine into the bottom of the baking sheet. Prehea the
broiler for about 5 minutes.  Then broil the clams under high heat
unti the breadcrumbs begin to brown.  Pour the liquid in the baking
sheet over t clams and serve immediately.
