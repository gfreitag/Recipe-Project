Title: Leek and Stilton Cheese Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
1    Vegetable Stock cube
4 oz Butter
4 oz Flour
3 pt Milk or single cream
1 lg Leek
1    Onion
2    To 4 oz Stilton cheese
-depending on taste
Cut Leek into small dice along with onion. Melt butter
in pan,add Leek and Onion. Cook on low gaa for 10
min.. Add flour and mix very well to form a thick
paste. Add milk slowly. Stirring continuously, simmer
for 10 minutes. Add in Stilton(grated) and stock cube,
then liquidize.

Stilton is a very strong aged cheese. One could
probably substitute real Roquefert or its poor
electrically aged cousin Blue Cheese and it still
would be wonderful.
