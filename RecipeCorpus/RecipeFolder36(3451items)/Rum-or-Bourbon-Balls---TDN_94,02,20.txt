Title: Rum or Bourbon Balls - TDN_94/02/20
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Cocoa, Dutch recommended
1/4 tb White Karo syrup
1/4 c  Rum or bourbon (or more)
1 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
1 c  Finely chopped pecans
1 c  Powdered sugar
The food processor is the perfect appliance to make the wafr crumbs
and chop the pecans fine enough. Mix all the dry ingredients in a
large bowl thoroughly before adding the corn syrup.  Toss and mix
with a fork before adding rum or bourbon.  Mix to coad well before
forming into about 2 dozen balls, formed by rolling about 1 teaspoon
of dough between hands. Roll in powdered sugar and store in a tightly
sealed container. Gingersnaps or chocolate wafers are sometimes used.
If chocolate wafers are used, omit the cocoa.  Almonds, or another
nut also can be used. In some recipes the bourbon bails are rolled in
cocoa or finely chopped nuts.  The nuts must be "dust fine."
