Title: ROCK CANDY for Kids
Categories: Kids, Kooknet
Yield: 1 servings
1 c water
2 c granulated sugar
Heavy cord
The book says to put one cup of water into a small saucepan, pour 2
cups of granulated sugar into the water, heat the water and sugar on
the stove over a medium heat, continue stirring until the sugar
melts, keep adding sugar and stirring until it melts, stop adding
sugar when you see that it will no longer dissolve in the water (that
is until you see sugar lying on the bottom of the saucepan). Remove
the pot from the stove, let the liquid cool until it is just warm.
Pour the liquid into a clean glass jar. Tie one end of a piece of
heavy cord around the middle of a pencil. Place the pencil over the
top of the glass jar letting the cord fall into the liquid. Crystals
will begin to form in a few hours. The next day, remove the cord from
the jar, pour the sugar liquid back into the saucepan, reheat and
cool it just as you did before. Pour the liquid back into the jar and
reinsert the cord with the crystals into it. More crystals will form.
If you repeat this procedure every day the crystal candy will grow
bigger and bigger. When it has reached a size that pleases you, snip
off any excess string and enjoy.
