Title: Green Tomato Pie #2
Categories: Tomatoes, Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Golden Raisins
2 tb Cider Vinegar
3 tb Vinegar
6 lg Green Tomatoes, sliced 1/4
-in. thick (do not use stem
-end)
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground Cloves
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground Red Pepper
Dough for a 9 inch two-crust pie

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Roll out dough and fit into a 9 in. pie
pan. Roll out remaining dough and set aside on waxed paper or a
lightly floured surface. Cover with wax paper to avoid drying out.

Put the sugar, flour, salt, cloves, cinnamon, and red pepper together
in a shallow bowl. Stir with a fork to mix. Take one third of the
tomato slices at a time and toss them in the sugar mixture so they
are evenly coated on all sides. Spread the sugared tomato slices
evenly over the dough in the pan. Sprinkle with the raisins and any
remaining mixture. Drizzle on vinegar, then dot with butter. Place
top crust on, crimp edges and cut steam vents in top. Bake for 40
minutes or until the crust is lightly colored and juices are bubbling
around the edges of the pie. Remove from oven, let cool and serve at
room temperature.
