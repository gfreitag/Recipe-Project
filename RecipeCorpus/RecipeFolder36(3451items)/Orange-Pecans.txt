Title: Orange Pecans
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 1 recipe
1 tb Orange juice
2 c  Pecan halves
1 pn Salt
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
Grated rind of 1 orange
Dissolve sugar in water in saucepan.  Boil to the
softball stage and remove from heat.  Add juice, rind,
pecans and salt. Return to heat and cook slowly,
stirring all the while, until the sugar crystalizes
and clings to the pecans. Turn out onto a buttered
pan, and separate the pecan halves using 2 forks. Any
sugar that doesn't stick to the pecans is yummy
pressed into rolled and cut cookies before they're
baked.
