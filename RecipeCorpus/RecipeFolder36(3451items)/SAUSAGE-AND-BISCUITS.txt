Title: SAUSAGE AND BISCUITS
Categories: Breakfast, Kooknet
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Milk; or half milk,
Half cream
1 lb Breakfast sausage
1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
Make the biscuits with baking mix such as Jiffy or Bisquik, cutting
in some additional butter if fat and calories don't scare you.

Break up the sausage as you brown it in frying pan. Then remove
meat and set aside.
Drain all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the pan; remove pan
from heat and stir in flour.  Add milk gradually, stirring.
Return pan to heat and cook as with any white sauce, stirring
until thick and smooth.
Return sausage to sauce, turn heat low, and let simmer a bit to
blend flavors.
Taste for seasoning; you are unlikely to want pepper, but you may
need a bit more salt.
Serve with eggs of you choice, but scrambled is my preference...
