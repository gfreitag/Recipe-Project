1    Dipping Chocolate
12    Strawberries, Fresh XL Fancy
Wash berries and leave tops on.  Dry the berries with paper towels,
making sure the berries are dry.  This is important.  If dipping
chocolate is not available; in a heavy saucepan or double boiler,
combine one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 T light corn syrup
and 5 T butter.  Heat over low heat until melted, stirring
occasionally.  Dip each berry in the chocolate, covering about 2/3 of
the berry.  Set aside to harden on a piece of waxed paper.  Cool in
refrigerator if necessary.  Melt chocolate a second time and dip each
berry, again covering about 2/3 of the berry. Cool in refrigerator
until ready to serve.  Top a dish of vanilla ice cream with a few
chilled berries and you have an elegant dessert.  From: Syd's
