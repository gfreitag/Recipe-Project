RELISH:
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add
the red and green peppers and the garlic; saute 5 minutes.  Stir in
the lime juice, sugar, and salt.  Cook 2 minutes, or until the juices
are slightly thickened.  Cool slightly and stir in the cilantro.
Refrigerate until completely chilled.
CORN CAKES:
Stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and
cumin.  Stir in the milk, eggs, Tabasco, chilies, and corn.  Let sit
15 minutes.
In a large non-stick skillet set over medium-high heat, melt a couple
slivers of the butter.  When pan is very hot, spoon 2 tablespoons
batter into the pan for each cake.  Cook about 3 cakes at a time for
about 2 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. (The batter
should make about 10 to 12 cakes.)  Keep warm while cooking the
remaining cakes, adding a little butter to the pan before cooking
each batch. Serve the corn cakes with a little of the relish on top.
Note:  Bottled salsa also can be served with the corn cakes in place
of the relish.
