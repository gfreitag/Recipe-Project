Title: Beet Green Souffle
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 1 souffle
1 c  Beet greens; sauteed
1/2 c  Cheddar cheese; grated
3    Egg yolks
4    Egg whites
3 tb Parmesan cheese; grated
2 md Beets; cooked and peeled
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
3/4 c  Chicken broth; hot
Butter a 1 qt. souffle dish; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Slice the
cooked beets and line the bottom of the souffle dish with them.

In a small saucepan, melt the butter, stir in the flour, add the hot
broth and continue to cook until slightly thickened, then transfer to
a larger bowl.  Coarsely chop beet greens and add to the sauce along
with Cheddar cheese.

In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks; blend them with beet green
mixture. Beat egg whites until they form peaks.  Fold into bowl with
other ingredients; blend well.  Transfer all to buttered souffle
dish.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Bake at 350 F. for 30 minutes, or until souffle is puffed and golden.

Ogden writes: "This may be one of the most exceptional souffles you'll
ever serve.  The beet color spreads upward from the bottom layer,
creating a rosy hue throughout."
