MMMMM------------------------=DIRECTIONS=-----------------------------
Combine all seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
Place a heavy 10-quart pot, preferably nonstick, over high heat
and add 6 cups of vegetable stock.  Bring to a full boil, add all
the seasoning mix and 1/4 of each vegetable.  Cook until the
vegetables are tender, about 14 to 16 minutes.  Strain the cooked
vegetables and, reserving the broth, transfer them to a food
processor.  Puree the vegetables, adding a little of the reserved
broth if necessary, until they are liquefied, about 2 to 3
minutes.  Return the pureed mixture to the pot, add the remaining
4 cups of stock and the apple juice, mix together, and bring to a
boil.  Add the remaining vegetables and return the mixture to a
boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and
simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Makes 20 cups, enough for 10 main-dish servings
