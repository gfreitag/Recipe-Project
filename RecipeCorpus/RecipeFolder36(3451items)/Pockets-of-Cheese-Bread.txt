In food processor bowl with metal blade, finely chop tomatoes. Add
beans, yogurt, cumin, oregano, parsley and garlic; process 10 to 15
seconds or until beans are mashed. Set aside.

Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In large bowl,
combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast, mix well.

In small saucepan, heat water and oil until very warm (120 to 130
degrees). Add warm liquid and egg to flour mixture. Blend at low speed
until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. Add bean mixture;
beat until well mixed. By hand, stir in green chilies and an
additional 3-1/2 to 4 cups flour to form a stiff dough.

On floured or cornmeal-coated surface, knead in 1/2 to 1 cup flour for
about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. Place dough in
greased bowl; cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and cloth
towel. Let rise in warm place (80 to 85 degrees) for 45 to 60 minutes
or until light and doubled in size.

Grease two 8 or 9 inch round cake pans or one large cookie sheet.
Punch down dough. Divide dough in half; shape each half into a 6 inch
round loaf. Place in greased pans. Using a sharp knife, 1-1/2 inches
from edge, cut deep ring around each loaf to the bottom. Cut another
deep ring 1 inch from the first cut. Insert cheese cubes deep into
cuts; pinch edges to completely seal. Cover; let rise in warm place
30 to 40 minutes or until light and almost doubled in size.

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Uncover dough. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or
until loaves are deep golden brown and sound hollow when lightly
tapped. Immediately remove from pans; cool on wire racks.

Note: This bread can be frozen. Thaw at room temperature. To reheat,
heat oven to 375 degrees. Wrap loaf in foil; bake for 30 to 40
minutes or until hot.
