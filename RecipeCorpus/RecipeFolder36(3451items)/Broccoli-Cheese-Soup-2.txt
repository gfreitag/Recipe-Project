Title: Broccoli Cheese Soup 2
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Flour
1/2 ts Salt
Fresh ground pepper
4 c  Milk
1 c  Cheddar cheese -- shredded
16 oz Chicken broth
1 md Broccoli -- (3 cups
Chopped)
1/2 c  Celery -- chopped
2 tb Butter or margarine
In medium saucepan, bring broth, broccoli and celery to a boil over
high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until broccoli is
tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.  Stir once or twice.  If you want a
smooth soup, puree broccoli in a blender.  Meanwhile, melt butter in
a large saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in flour, salt and pepper to
taste; cook for 1 minute. With a whisk, add milk gradually, beating
constantly to prevent lumping. Bring to a boil and add broccoli and
its liquid.  Remove from heat and stir in cheese.  Ladle into
individual bowls.
