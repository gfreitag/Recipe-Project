Title: Guava Jelly
Categories: Dips/spread, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
Lime juice
Guavas; slightly underripe
Sugar
Read about making jellies.

Wash the guavas and cut into quarters. Cover with water and boil, then
simmer for 1/2 hr. Put the juice through a jelly bag but do not press
as the juice will become bitter. Allow 1 cup of sugar for each cup of
juice. Bring the mixture to a boil and add 1 teaspoon of lime juice
for each cup of juice. Cook only 4 cups at a time.
