FOR CRANBERRY FILLING:
Combine cranberries, sugar, and fresh orange juice in heavy medium
saucepan.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar
dissolves.  Reduce heat and simmer until berries pop and mixture
thickens, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, about 10 minutes.
Cool cranberry filling completely.
FOR CHEESE FILLING:
Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl
until well blended.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating after each
addition.  Set cheese filling aside.
FOR CRUST:
Preheat oven to 350F degrees.  Lightly butter 9-inch diameter spring
form pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Place cookie crumbs in medium
bowl.  Add melted butter and blend until moist crumbs form.  Press
onto bottom (not sides) of prepared pan.
Pour cheese filling over crust in pan.  Spoon 1 cup cranberry filling
over cheese filling (reserve remaining cranberry filling for
compote).  Using a small sharp knife, swirl to form marble pattern.
Bake until center of cheesecake is set, about 1 hour.  Transfer
cheesecake to rack and maintain oven temperature.
MEANWHILE, PREPARE TOPPING:
Mix sour cream, sugar, and vanilla in small bowl.  Gently press down
any raised edges of cheesecake.  Spoon topping over cake.  Bake 5
minutes. Transfer cheesecake to rack and cool.  Cover and refrigerate
over night. (Cheesecake can be prepared 2 days in advance.  Keep
refrigerated) Release pan sides.  Transfer cheesecake to platter.
Cut cheesecake into wedges and serve, passing compote separately.
CRANBERRY ORANGE COMPOTE:
Combine sugar and water in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to a boil,
stirring until sugar dissolves and liquid appears clear.  Transfer to
medium bowl and mix in 1 3/4 cups reserved cranberry filling and
minced orange peel.  Using small sharp knife, cut peel and white pith
from oranges.  Working over another bowl to catch juices, cut between
membranes to release segments.  Add segments to bowl with juices.
(Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Cover oranges and cranberry filling
separately and refrigerate.)  Add orange segments and juices to
compote and serve.  Use ~--
