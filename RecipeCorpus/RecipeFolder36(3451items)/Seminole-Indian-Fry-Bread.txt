water and knead lightly for 1 minute. Turn out onto a well floured
surface and knead until a smooth ball forms. Divide the dough into 8
equal parts and shape each into a small ball. Cover with an inverted
bowl and let rest for about 10 minutes. On a floured surface roll
each ball into a 6 inch circle. Poke a hole in the center of each
round of dough. In a skillet heat about 1-1 1/2 inches of vegetable
oil, until smoke appears. (375x F.) Fry the dough rounds one at a
time until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels and

Ingredients: 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour sifted 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2
About 1 cup hot water Shortening or
tablespoon shortening
oil for frying

Sift flour and salt into a bowl. Add the shortening and blend well.
The water should be hot, but not boiling. Add water a little at a
time, blending well. The dough should be soft but not sticky. You may
need a little more or less water. Blend well and knead for 1-2
minutes. Turn out on to a floured board and knead until very smooth.
Divide into little balls. Cover and let rest for 3040 minutes. Roll
out each ball as thin as possible, into about 4-5 inch in diameter
circles. Heat 1/2 cup shortening or oil in a skillet and drop each
piece of dough into the fat. Press down in the center with a spoon.
Release. When they are puffed up, turn and brown on the other side.
Drain them on paper towels and serve hot. May be made in advance and
reheated.
