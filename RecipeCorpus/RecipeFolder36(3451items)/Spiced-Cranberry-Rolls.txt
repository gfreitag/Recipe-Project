Title: Spiced Cranberry Rolls
Categories: Holiday, Breads
Yield: 24 servings
2    Eggs at room temperature --
-lightly beaten
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
4 1/2 c  Plus 2 Tbl  All-purpose
-flour
2/3 c  Chopped fresh cranberries
1 c  Milk
4 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Plus 2 Tbl  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 pk 1/4 oz Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (110 to 115
-degrees F)
1.  In a small saucepan, bring the milk to a boil over moderately high
heat.  Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, 1/4 cup of the
sugar and the salt until dissolved.  Let cool to lukewarm.

2.  In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water.  Set
aside for 5 minutes.  Whisk in the warm milk mixture, beaten eggs,
ginger and nutmeg.  With a wooden spoon, stir in 4 cups of the flour
until incorporated.

3.  Dust a work surface with 1/4 cup of the flour.  Turn out the dough
and knead for about 6 minutes, adding about 1/4 cup more flour by
tablespoons to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough.

4.  On the work surface, sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons flour
and 2 tablespoons sugar over the cranberries and quickly knead them
into the dough.  The dough will be sticky and wet.  Transfer the
dough to a lightly greased large bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 40 minutes.

5.  Lightly butter 2 large baking sheets.  Turn the dough out onto a
well-floured surface and roll it out 1/2-inch thick.  With a 2
1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut into rounds.  Reroll the scraps and cut
out more rounds.  Plump each round into a ball by pulling the edges
under and pinching the dough at the bottom.  Place the rolls seam
side down on the prepared baking sheets, 1 inch apart.  Cover with a
kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.

6.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Set the racks in the upper and
lower thirds of the oven.  Bake the rolls for 10 minutes, then switch
the baking sheets and bake for 6 to 8 minutes longer until nicely
browned. Serve warm.

(The rolls can also be cooled completely, sealed in sturdy plastic
bags and frozen for up to 1 month.  Thaw before reheating.)
