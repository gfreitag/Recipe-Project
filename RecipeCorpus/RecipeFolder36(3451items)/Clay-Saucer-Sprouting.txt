Title: Clay Saucer Sprouting
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------METHOD AND INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------
Clay saucer sprouting works best for gelatinous sees that are
difficult to rinse in jars.

1. Use a clean, unglazed clay flowerpot saucer.

2. Put equal amounts of seeds and water into the saucer.

3. Set the saucer in a larger pan and pour water into the pan to
within 1/2
inch of top of saucer.

4. Cover with a plate and set aside in a warm (70 degree F), dark
place.

5. Check the seeds daily, misting them if they become dry, or
removing the plate cover for a day if they're too wet.

6. On about the fourth day, move the sprouts into the sunlight so the
leaves turn green. Mist as needed.

7. Move the sprouts from the saucer to a strainer, and rinse well to
remove the hulls, if desired. Hulls can shorten the storage life of
sprouts, but they also add flavor.

8. Use sprouts immediately in salads, sandwiches, or as the recipe
suggests. To store, put in plastic bags and refrigerate.

9. Wash and dry all equipment and put away for next use.
