If you don't have a long, narrow fish poacher, an enamel roasting pan
5" deep will do just as well. Fill the pan with water to a depth of
4" and add 1/2 cup salt. Bring to a boil (over two burners, if
necessary), reduce heat slightly and gently slide the cod slices into
the water with a spatula. Lower the heat until water is bubbling
slightly and simmer for about 5 minutes. Be careful not to overcook
or the fish will disintegrate. Remove the slices with a slotted
spatula and drain them on a linen napkin or dish towel. Reserve stock
for use in the egg sauce. Arrange cod attractively on a heated
platter and serve with egg sauce.
EGG SAUCE: Melt the butter in a saucepan. Remove from the heat, beat
in 1/4 cup of the stock in which you poached the fish and stir in
chopped egg, tomato, parsley and chives. Add salt and pepper to
taste. Heat almost to the boiling point, pour into a sauceboat and
serve with the cod. If you prefer, you can simply pour melted butter
over the cod and garnish with lemon slices and parsley. In Norway,
this dish is often accompanied by raw diced carrots, sprinkled with
lemon juice and new potatoes (see recipe).
