Title: Bacon and Bean Soup #2
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables, Meats, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1/3 c  Turnip; diced
2    Bay leaves
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Sage; [optional]
1/2 ts Louisiana hot sauce; or
1 ts Prepared mustard; [opt'l]
1 tb Parsley; chopped
1 c  Dry pinto or other beans
1 qt Water; or more, hot
1    Ham bone: or
1/4 lb Salt pork; diced or
1/4 lb Back bacon; cubed
1/2 ts Salt; or to taste
2    Ribs celery, chopped
1 md Carrot; chopped
1 md Onion, chopped
Wash and pick over the beans, removing stones, loose skins and
shriveled beans. Put in a large covered pot and cover with hot
water. Soak over night if you want to cut down on cooking time.
When beans start to simmer add ham bone, salt pork or bacon. Add
more water as needed but only hot or boiling water. Do not add
cold water as the beans will turn dark. If you cook without a lid
the beans will also turn a dark color. Do not salt until the beans
are cooked.

Remove the hambone from the pot, pick the meat from it and return
the meat to the pot. Add the other ingredients except the parsley
to the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15
minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove the bay leaves and
ladle into warm soup tureen or soup bowls. Garnish with fresh
minced parsley. This soup tastes even better if it is rested and
re-heated the second day.
