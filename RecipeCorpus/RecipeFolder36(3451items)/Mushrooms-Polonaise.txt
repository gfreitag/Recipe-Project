Title: Mushrooms Polonaise
Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
1/2 ts Nutmeg
Pepper
1/2 c  Parsley -- chopped
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1 1/2 lb Mushrooms -- sliced
1    Onion -- chopped
3/4 c  Butter
2 tb Flour
1 c  Sour cream
Preheat oven to 350F.

Place mushrooms and onion in a heavy, _dry_ skillet.  Cover, and over
very low heat, allow vegetables to cook in their own juices until
they almost stick to the pan.  Add 1/2 c butter.  When butter has
melted, add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes over
very low heat. Stir in sour cream and heavy cream with a wooden
spoon, then add nutmeg and pepper to taste.  Continue to cook,
uncovered until mixture has thickened.  Stir in parsley.

In another pan, lightly saute bread crumbs in 1/4 c butter.  Pour
mushroom mixture into a buttered shallow casserole.  Sprinkle top with
sauteed bread crumbs.  Bake until mixture has set and bread crumbs
have browned a little more.

6 servings.
