FLEMISH METHOD

Combine all ingredients except the liver, wine, and the goose itself.
Crush the liver with a fork, discarding all connective tissue, then
add it to the stuffing and blend thoroughly, moistening with white
wine to the consistency of any ordinary stuffing.  Fill the body
cavity of the bird which has been cleaned and singed with the
mixture.  Skewer or sew the vent, and truss.
Place in a braising kettle the raw ham, then the braising vegetables
(carrots, celery, onion, etc.). Set the stuffed bird over these and
pour over it a cup of good chicken or game stock to which the gin has
been added. Cover closely and cook in a hot oven (400 o F.) about 1
1/2 hours without disturbing. Lift out the bird, place on a hot
platter, brush over with melted fumet (which see) and keep hot.
Remove any excess fat from the braising kettle. Place over a hot fire
and sprinkle in a scant tablespoon of flour. Bring to a rapid boil,
stirring constantly. Add 1/2 cup of white wine, again bring to boiling
point and strain through a fine sieve, pressing a little to extract
all liquid from the vegetables. Add additional seasoning if
necessary. Serve with the goose, accompanying this with plain boiled
rice or wild rice and garnishing the serving platter with apple rings.
