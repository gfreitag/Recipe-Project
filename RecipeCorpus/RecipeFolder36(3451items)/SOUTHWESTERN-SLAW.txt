Title: SOUTHWESTERN SLAW
Categories: Salads
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Brown sugar
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1 ts Colorado chile powder
1/2    Head red cabbage; julienned
1/2    Red onion; finely julienned
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Ground cumin
In a medium bowl place all of the ingredients.  Toss them together
well. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. Note from Executive Chef

minutes, that's just the minimum time.  You can make it ahead, if you
want."
