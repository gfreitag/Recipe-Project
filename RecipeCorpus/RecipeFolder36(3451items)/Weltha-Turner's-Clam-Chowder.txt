Title: Weltha Turner's Clam Chowder
Categories: Soup/stew, Fish/seafoo, Vegetables

13 oz Clams, minced (2 cans)
3 tb Margarine or butter
2 pt Milk or Light Cream *
6 ea Bacon strips, diced
6 tb Onion, diced
2 c  Water
2 c  Potato, diced
* For a really rich taste use nondairy creamer such as Mocha Mix.

Saute bacon until lightly browned. Add onion and saute until soft.

Add Potatoes, water and broth from clams. Simmer until potatoes are
tender, add drained clams.

Add milk and margarine, serve when margarine is melted.

DO NOT BOIL!
HEAT GENTLY,

Note: My mom found this makes a really great potato soup if you
forget and leave the can of clams sitting on the counter until after
everyone has finished eating! . Thicken with flour mixed in water or
roux if desired.
