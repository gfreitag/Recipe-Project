Holding your knife parallel to the chicken breast, cut off wide thin
slices. Cut these slices approximately 2 X 3/4 inch strips and thread
them on the skewers, leaving a handle of about 4 inches. (The
skewered meat should be as flat and thin as possible) Mix the
marinade ingredients together. Arrange the skewers in a shallow dish,
handles overlapping, and pour the marinade over the meat. Allow to
stand 30 to 60 minutes, turning from time to time. (Start your coals
now). To grill the chicken, simply cook about 1 minute on each
side-do not overcook- and serve with peanut sauce.
