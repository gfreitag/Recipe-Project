Title: MOM'S CITY CHICKEN
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Parsley
1/2 ts Dill
1    Egg
1/2 c  Milk
Flour to dredge
1 lb Stew beef
1 lb Boneless pork
1 lb Boneless chicken breasts
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Basil
Mix the egg and milk together and set aside. Preheat oven to 300-325F.
Prepare the meat as if it were a shish-ka-bob; that is, alternate the
meats and place on a 10" skewer. Dredge the meat in the egg/milk
mixture, then the flour, and put into a non-stick baking dish.
Sprinkle the spices ontop. (You might want to coat the dish with a
non-stick spray first).
Bake at 300-325 degrees (a slow oven) for about 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or
until the meat is browned on all sides and very tender. If you wish,
serve this with gravy. It is very filling and very good.
