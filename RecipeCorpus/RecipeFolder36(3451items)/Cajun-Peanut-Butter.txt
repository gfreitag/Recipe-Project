Title: Cajun Peanut Butter
Categories: Sandwich
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 ts Paprika
1 lb Shelled raw peanuts
2 tb Brown sugar
1/2 ts Black pepper
Preheat the oven to 375 F.

Place the peanuts in a large bowl. Sprinkle with the remaining
ingredients, mixing well. Lay the seasoned peanuts in a single layer
on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cook in the
preheated oven until the brown sugar on the peanuts forms little
crystals, about 15 min. Watch carefully to make sure the peanuts
don't burn. Remove the peanuts form the oven, separate and cool.

Puree the cooled peanuts to desired consistency in a food processor,
about 1 min for smooth peanut butter, less for chunky. Store in the
refrigerator in an airtight container. Remember, since this contains
no preservatives, it has a very short shelf life - about 2 weeks,
even when refrigerated.
