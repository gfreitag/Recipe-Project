Title: Provencal Dried Herbs (Herbs De Provence)
Categories: Herbs/spice, Mixes
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Dried savory
1/4 ts Dried marjoram
2 ts Dried thyme
1 ts Dried oregano
Some of you might like to make your own Herbs de Provence,
some people think this mixture is better than the prepared herbs you
can buy in a store.  As I recall lavender is something else you can
add but I can't find it.

Combine spices; store in an airtight container.
