Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM---------------------------ROLLS--------------------------------
1 ts Salt
2    Eggs
4 c  Flour
1 pk Yeast
1 c  Warm milk
1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Margarine -- melted
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------

2 1/2 tb Cinnamon
MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/8 ts Salt
8 tb Margarine -- softened
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
2 oz Cream cheese
For the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl.
Add the sugar, margarine, salt, eggs and flour and mix well.  Knead
the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with
flour.  Put in a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1
hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.  Roll the dough out on
a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough flat until it is about 21"
long and 16" wide.  It should be about 1/4" thick.  Preheat oven to
400. For the filling, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.
Spread the softened margarine evenly over the surface of the dough
and then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar evenly over the surface.
Working carefully from the 21" side, roll the dough down to the bottom
edge.  Cut the rolled dough into 1 3/4" slices and place 6 at a time,
evenly spaced, in a lightly greased baking pan.  Bake for 10 minutes,
or until light brown on top.  While the rolls bake, combine the icing
ingredients.  Beat well with an electric mixer until fluffy.  When the
rolls come out of the oven, coat each generously with icing.
