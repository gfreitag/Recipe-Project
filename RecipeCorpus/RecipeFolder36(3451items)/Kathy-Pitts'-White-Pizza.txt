Title: Kathy Pitts' White Pizza
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 1 pizza  Make your favorite pizza dough.  While dough is resting, slice and
saute VERY slowly in olive oil a large quantity of thinly sliced
white onions. (How many onions? Let your conscience be your guide --
you can't have too many onions, in my opinion.) Cook the onions,
stirring occasionally, until they are golden, and almost reduced to a
pulp. Set aside to cool, while you roll out the dough.

Form the pizza, and let rise for a half hour of so.  Using your
fingers, make dents in the dough. Now drizzle the dough with olive
oil. Sprinkle all over with rosemary (fresh if possible), and layer
the cooled onions over the dough.

Now, cover the onions with a good-sized layer of freshly grated
Parmesan or Romano cheese. Bake as usual.

This makes a wonderful snack with drinks, or we like it as a meal
with a good salad of mixed greens.
