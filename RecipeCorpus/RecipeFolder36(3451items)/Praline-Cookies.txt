The poster writes: The latest rage down here in the
old south is the Bed and Breakfast in ante bellum
homes, authentic and faux. It follows that the recipes
developed by the maiden aunt who lived on the third
floor and crept down to make her cookies in the middle
of the night are the most sacred of documents,
cherished and guarded, and exploited, and maybe even,
heaven forfend, faked. There are several small
bakeries born of the B and B who claim this cookie was
developed by such a person, and is unique to that
family. When I was a child, a looong time ago, this
cookie was all the rage, and so easy!!

HERE IS MY FAMILY'S SECRET  OOOOH What could it be?
Lightly toast the pecans first.  Cool completely
before adding to egg whites. This is sort of a
meringue, but not really. It starts off crisp, and
will stay that way depending on weather conditions.
It gets chewy after awhile and is still delicious.
