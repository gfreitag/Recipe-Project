Title: Tex-Mex Brunch - Sopaipillas - SL 4/91
Categories: Tex/mexican, Breakfast, Breads
Yield: 2 dozen
1 ts Salt
Vegetable oil
Sifted powdered sugar
Honey (optional)
1 pk Dry yeast
1 1/2 c  ;Warm water (105F to 115F)
1 tb Shortening; melted
1 tb Sugar
4 c  All-purpose flour
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl; let stand 5
minutes. Stir in melted shortening and sugar. Combine flour and salt;
add to the yeast mixture, stirring well.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until
smooth and elastic (about 2 minutes). Place in a well-greased bowl,
turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85
degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Punch
dough down; roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 2-1/2-inch
squares.

Pour oil to depth of 3 inches into a Dutch oven; heat to 375
degrees. Fry a few sopaipillas at a time in hot oil, lightly pressing
down with the back of a fork until dough starts to puff. Release
pressure, and continue frying until golden-brown, turning once. Drain.

Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve, if desired, with honey.
