Layer another cup of meat mixture, remaining lasagna, another 1/2 cup
of cheese.  Cover with remaining meat mixture.  Put into an oven

lasagna out of oven and pour cheese mixture evenly over it.  Sprinkle
with paprika and return to the oven for another 40 minutes. Remove
from the oven and allow to cool for 20-30 mins before serving.

Yield:  One small lasagne that feeds 2-3.  Don't see why it couldn't
be doubled.
