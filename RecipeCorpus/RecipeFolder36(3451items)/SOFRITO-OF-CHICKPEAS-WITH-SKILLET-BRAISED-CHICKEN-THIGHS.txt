both sides with salt and pepper.  In a large cast-iron or non-stick
skillet,
heat 1 T oil over high heat.  Add chicken, partially cover the pan
and cook until the chicken is nicely browned, about 2 minutes per
side (it will not be
fully cooked).  Remove from the skillet and set aside.  Reduce heat to
medium, add the remaining 1/2 T oil to the skillet. Add dried chile
peppers and cook until they turn dark, about 2 minutes. Remove with a
slotted spoon and discard. Add onions and garlic to the skillet; cook
until soft & lightly
browned, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add paprika and marjoram and cook,
stirring, for 1
minute.  Add tomatoes, green peppers and salt & pepper to taste; cook
for 5 minutes longer.  Return the chicken to the skillet, along with
1/2 c of the chicken stock.  Cover and simmer until the chicken is
tender and no longer pink inside, 20 to 25 minutes.  Add chickpeas
and the remaining 1/2 c chicken
stock; simmer for 5 to 8 minutes.  Blot off any fat that rises to the
surface
with paper towels.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  Garnish with
parsley.
