Combine pineapple, citrons, peels, cherries, raisins & currants in a
large bowl.  Add 1/2 c grapefruit juice, mix very well.  Cover & let

In a third bowl, beat the shortening for 30 seconds.  Gradually add
the sugars, creaming well as you add them.  Stir in the cornstarch.

the flour mixture.  Add the almond extract & the rest of the
grapefruit juice, stirring well until the mixture is well combined.

Preheat oven to 275F.

Grease a 10" square cake tin.  Line with brown paper & grease the
paper. Transfer the cake mixture to the cake tin.  Press down gently.
Bake for 3 hours.  Check after two hours.  If the top is browning too
quickly, cover with some waxed paper.

After it is cooked, remove from the oven & place on a wire rack to
cool for 30 minutes.  Gently remove cake from the tin & peel away the
paper. Let cool on wire racks till completely cooled.  Wrap in waxed
paper & keep in a cool place.

If icing the cake, layer with marzipan & then decorate as desired.
