1    Egg; beaten
2/3 c  Milk; about
3 tb Butter; melted
1 md Cabbage; cut in wedges
2 c  Flour; sifted
1 ts Salt
4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Pepper
You will need a large kettle.  Cover corned beef with cold water;
bring to simmering; cook at this temperature for 3 1/2 to 4 hours or
until the meat is tender.  At the end of 3 1/2 hours, add pared
potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips and peeled whole onions to meat
in the kettle. Lay cabbage wedges over top of vegetables and meat.
Cover; cook for about 25 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Cook beets separately, if fresh, until tender.  Depending on size of
beets, beets take longer to cook than some vegetables.  If canned,
reheat to boiling. When all is cooked, remove meat and vegetables to
a large platter; keep warm while the dumplings cook in the  kettle
juices. FOR THE DUMPLINGS:
This needs to be a stiff moist batter.  Mix together and sift the
flour, salt, baking powder and pepper.  Combine egg and milk with
melted butter; add to sifted dry ingredients.  Have "pot likker"
(liquid in which dinner was cooked) boiling.  Spoon batter by
tablespoonfuls into boiling liquid. Cook, uncovered, until liquid
boils again; cover kettle tightly and cook for 20 minutes.  Do not
lift cover during cooking.
