Title: HAZELNUT COOKIES
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 40 servings
1    Lemon's peel; finely grated
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
10    Candied cherries; quartered
2    Egg whites
1 1/2 c  Hazelnuts; finely ground
3/4 c  Superfine sugar
Preheat oven to 350 F (175 C).  Line several baking sheets with rice
paper.  In a medium-size bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.
Very carefully fold hazelnuts, sugar, lemon peel and cinnamon into egg
whites until mixture is smooth.  Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a
3/4-inch-plain tip.  Pipe small circles, about 1-1/2 inches in
diameter, onto prepared baking sheets, spacing well apart.  Place a
cherry quarter in the center of each circle.  Bake 20 minutes or
until very lightly browned.  Remove from oven; leave cookies on
baking sheets until cool. When cool, remove cookies and peel paper
off each one.
