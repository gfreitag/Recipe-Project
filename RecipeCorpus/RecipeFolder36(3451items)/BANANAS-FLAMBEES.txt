Title: BANANAS FLAMBEES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Sugar
2 oz Rum
3    Bananas
3 tb Butter
Peel bananas, splitting lengthwise and cutting in halves. Place
bananas in a buttered, shallow, oven-proof baking dish and dot with
butter. Sprinkle sugar over bananas. Bake uncovered at 325'F for
about 35 minutes. Set dish on stove, being careful to keep warm. Pour
rum in a long-handled spoon, which has been warmed by dipping in
boiling water. Set a match to the rum and as it flames pour over
bananas. As it runs down in the dish, ladle it up and over the
bananas until the flaming ceases. The secret of this dessert is to
have all ingredients warm, otherwise it will not flame well.

This old recipe, as good today as years ago, was brought to Louisiana
by a distant relative of Empress Josephine, at whose table this was
often served.
