Title: Crab Stuffed Mushrooms 1
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Appetizers, Vegetables, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
Worcestershire sauce
Tabasco sauce
1/2 c  Butter
32 sm Strips pimento
32    Mushrooms (1 1/2" diam)
8 oz Fresh crab meat
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/4 c  Chopped mild onion
2/3 c  Fontina-style cheese, grated
Pick through the crabmeat and remove any bits of shell.  Melt the
butter. Remove the stems from the mushrooms; clean and chop coarsely.
Dip the mushroom caps in the butter and set them aside on a broiler
pan. Combine the chopped stems and the remaining butter and cook over
medium heat until the liquid from the mushrooms evaporates, about 5
minutes. Combine the crab with the mayonnaise, onion, and cheese. Add
a few drops each Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco. Stuff the mushroom
caps evenly with the crab mixture and sprinkle them with the cooked
mushroom stem pieces. Place a strip of pimento on each. Place the
broiler rack on the top shelf of a preheated oven and broil mushrooms
for 3 to 5 minutes, until filling is hot and bubbling. Serve
immediately.
