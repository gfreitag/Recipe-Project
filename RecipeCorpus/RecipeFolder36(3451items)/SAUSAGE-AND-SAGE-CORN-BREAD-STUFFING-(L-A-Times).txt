CORN BREAD

Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in
bowl. Stir in sage.
Combine milk and vinegar and let stand 5 minutes. Stir in egg
substitute and corn.
Stir liquid ingredients quickly into dry ingredients just until dry
ingredients are moistened. Pour into lightly buttered 8-inch square
baking pan or one that has been sprayed with non-stick
butter-flavored cooking spray. Bake at 450 degrees until toothpick
inserted in center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool to
room temperature. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes and reserve in large bowl.

STUFFING

Saute sausage patties in skillet, breaking up with spoon until
browned. Add onion, garlic and celery and continue to saute until
onion is tender. Stir in mushrooms, cover and cook until tender,
about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in bell pepper, parsley,
sage and salt and pepper to taste. Add to cubed corn bread in bowl.
Combine egg substitute and broth. Pour broth over stuffing and toss
until mixed. If necessary, add additional broth to moisten to desired
consistency. Correct seasoning. Spoon 1/2 cup stuffing evenly into
each of 6 cups in muffin pan that has been lightly buttered or
sprayed with butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray. Lightly brush
tops with butter or lightly spray with butter-flavored non-stick
cooking spray. Bake at 425 degrees until stuffing begins to brown and
edges are crisp, about 25 to 30 minutes.
