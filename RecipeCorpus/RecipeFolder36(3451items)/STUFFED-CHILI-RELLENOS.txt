GUY ATTWOOD
1 cn Whole Ortega chilies
Monterey Jack cheese; grated
6 oz Crab;and/or cooked and diced
1/2 lb Very sharp cheddar cheese
Drain the chilies. Plan about 4 per person. Open each chili flat. In
the bottom of a well buttered glass oven dish; place a layer of
chilies. Dust the jack cheese with a small amount of flour. Mix
together the crab and/or shrimp with the Jack cheese. Place a thin
layer of this mix over the bottom layer of chilies.
Place another layer of chilies on top and repeat process ending with
a top layer of chilies.

Cook in a 375*F oven for 7-10 minutes; uncovered.
Remove from oven and reduce heat to 300*F. Mix together the
batter--you may have to double the batter to be sure you cover the
dish well--and pour over the chilies. Add the cheddar cheese and
cook, COVERED, slowly in a 300*F oven until done. You will know it is
done when a knife inserted in the middle comes out relatively clean.
If the center does not set up completely after about 30 minutes,
don't worry just serve it up with a salad and, I like corn with it.
