Categories: Herbs/spice, Cake/cookie, Snacks
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Anise seed
1 1/3 c  Flour, sifted (*)
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
Put sugar, eggs and anise seed into pan, stir well and put on medium
heat. Stir constantly, and when little more than lukewarm, add flour.
Take from heat, and beat well.  Then when well mixed, drop by
teaspoonfuls on greased cookie sheet, not too close together.  Let

better the cookies will be.
