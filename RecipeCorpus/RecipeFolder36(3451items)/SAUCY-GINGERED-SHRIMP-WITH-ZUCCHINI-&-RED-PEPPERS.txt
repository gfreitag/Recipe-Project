In a large cast-iron or non-stick skillet, heat 1/2 T oil over medium
heat. Add red peppers and zucchini; cook until barely tender, about 2
minutes. Transfer to a dish & reserve.  Add 1 T more oil to the
skillet & increase heat to high.  When oil is hot but not smoking,
add shrimp and jalapenos; saute until the shrimp are nicely browned,
1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a dish
and set aside.  Reduce heat to medium-high.  Add the remaining 1/2 T
oil to the skillet, then add shallots, ginger and garlic; saute until
the mixture is
soft but not brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Pour in wine and lime juice; boil
until
reduced to a glaze, 3 to 5 minutes.  Pour in stock and mirin; boil
until reduced to 2 T, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, season with
salt and pepper,
and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.  In small bowl, dissolve cornstarch in
1 T water; whisk into simmering mixture and cook, stirring, until the
sauce thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add
scallions, cilantro, the reserved vegetable mixture and shrimp (with
their juices) to the skillet and just heat through.  Season with salt
and pepper.
