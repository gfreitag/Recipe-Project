Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
2    9-rib racks of lamb
- well trimmed and cut

4 tb Sweet butter (or as needed)
Northern White Beans
1    Rosemary sprig; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
1/2 c  Chablis
4 tb Dijon mustard
4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper
In a small saucepan place the rosemary, garlic, and Chablis.  Cook the
ingredients on medium heat for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the liquid is
reduced to 2 tablespoons. Pour marinade into a blender and pure it.
Add the mustard and blend it in. With the blender still running,
slowly dribble in the olive oil. Season the mustard paste with the
salt and set it aside. Season the lamb with the salt and pepper.
Coat both sides with the mustard paste. In a large saut pan place
the butter and heat it on medium high until it has melted. Add the
lamb racks and saut them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until
they are lightly browned. Preheat the oven to 450øF. Place the lamb
racks in a baking pan and roast them for 10 minutes, or until they
are medium rare.  Turn the lamb so that all sides are evenly browned.
Remove the lamb racks from the oven and place them on a warm plate.
Let them rest for 5 minutes. Slice the lamb between each bone. On
each of 6 individual serving plates place the Northern White Beans.
Place the lamb on top.
