Categories: Breads, Kooknet
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Cornmeal
1 tb Yeast
1 lg Spanish Onions; cooked in
2 tb Olive Oil
1 1/4 c  Water
1/3 c  Olive Oil
1/3 c  Rosemary Leaves
2 ts Salt
3 c  Flour

Ground Pepper
2 tb Olive Oil
Coarse Salt
Place all dough ingredients except cooked onion in the machine,
program for knead and first rise. Press start. Strain onions and
return liquid. At end of final knead, add the onion (without liquid)
to the machine. Restart and knead only until the onion is roughly
mixed in. The dough will be wet and onion will remain in clumps,
sticking out of the dough. Turn the dough out on a well-floured board
and knead briefly by hand to form a ball. Oil a pizza pan or baking
sheet. Place the dough on the prepared pan and pat into a 12" disk.
Coat the top of the dough with the onion juices. Cover with plastic
wrap and let it rise either at room temperature until doubled in
bulk, or in the refrigerator overnight.  A long cold rise in the
refrigerator will result in a more flavorful bread with a heartier
interior. Preheat the oven to 450øF. with the rack in the center
position.

Just before baking the dough, use your fingertips to gently make
indentations in the surface. Drizzle on the oil and then sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce to oven to
350øF. and bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the focaccia
is golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.
