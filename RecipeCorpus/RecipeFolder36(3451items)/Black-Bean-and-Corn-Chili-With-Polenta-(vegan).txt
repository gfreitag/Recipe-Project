To cook polenta, bring 2 1/4c water to a boil in a saucepan.  Combine
cornmeal, 3/4c cold water and salt in a small bowl.  Slowly add the
boiling water, stirring constantly.  Cook and stir until the mixture
returns to a boil.  Reduce heat to very low.  Cover and simmer 15
mins, stirring occasionally.  Pour hot mixture into a greased 8x8x2
baking pan. Cool for 1 hour.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for
several hours or overnight until firm.

Cook onion, garlic and fresh jalapenos in hot oil in a saucepan over
medium heat until tender but not brown.  Stir in oregano and cumin;
cook for 1 minute more.  Drain stewed tomatoes, reserving liquid. Set
tomatoes aside.  Add tomato liquid, tomato sauce and beer to onion
mixture and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered for 5
mins.

Coarsely chop the stewed tomatoes.  Add tomatoes, black beans, corn
and black pepper to taste to onion mixture.  Simmer, uncovered, for
15 to 20 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed and the
mixture thickens.

Meanwhile, remove polenta from pan and cut into 4 squares, then cut
each square in half diagonally.  Place on greased baking dish and
bake, covered with foil, in a 400 oven for 10-12 mins or until heated
thru.  To serve, place 2 polenta triangles on a plate.  Spoon chili
over polenta.
