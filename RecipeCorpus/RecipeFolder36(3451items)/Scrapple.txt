Title: Scrapple
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1/4 ts Sage (Optional)
Butter for frying
Fried egg and bacon
2 1/2 pt Beef broth or water
8 oz Cooked lean pork diced small
5 oz Cornmeal
1 ts Salt
to serve

1. Put the broth or water in a large heavy bottomed casserole, and the
pork and bring up to a simmer for 10 minutes, then bring up to a
rolling boil.
2. Slowly sprinkle in the cornmeal, whisking vigorously all the while
to avoid lumps.  Continue stirring until the mixture resembles thick
porridge.
3. Add the seasoning and cook over a low heat for 1 hour, stirring
from time to time to stop the mixture sticking to the bottom of the
pan. 4. Pour the mixture into a greased 3pt tin and set aside to
cool.  When cold turn out and slice the scrapple.  Fry the slices in
butter or lard and serve them with fried eggs and bacon for a hearty
breakfast.
