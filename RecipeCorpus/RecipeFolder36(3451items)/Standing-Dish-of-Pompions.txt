Title: Standing Dish of Pompions
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------FROM: THE THANKSGIVING BOOK---------------------
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1/4 ts Cinnamon
Salt to taste
8 c  Peeled diced pumpkin
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Butter
2 tb Vinegar
Place 2 cups pumpkin and 1/4 cup water into a pot and cook gently over
low heat until pumpkin softens, about 10 minutes.  Gradually add the
rest of the pumpkin and continue cooking until the entire mixture is
tender and pumpkin retains much of its form, about 20 to 30 minutes.
The mixture should resemble stewed apples.
Remove from heat and add butter, vinegar, brown sugar, and spices.
Stir gently and serve immediately.  Yield:  6 to 8 servings.
