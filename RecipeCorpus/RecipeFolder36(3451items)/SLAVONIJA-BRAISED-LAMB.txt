SPAETZLE:  Mix eggs, salt and flour together to form a fairly stiff
dough. Pat out into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick on a damp
breadboard. With a damp table knife, cut into strips 1 inch wide. Cut

colander and quickly turn into a hot bowl or casserole. Sprinkle with
butter or buttered crumbs; toss lightly and serve with any sauced
meat dish.
