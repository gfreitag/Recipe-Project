Roast beef bones and knuckles in single layer in roasting pan at 500
degrees, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Pour off excess fat and put bones in stock pot. Put roasting pan
over high heat, add little water and deglaze, scraping bottom to free
any stuck bits of meat.
Pour deglazed mixture over bones, then add water to cover. Add onion,
tomato, quartered carrot, bay leaf and thyme. Bring to simmer,
skimming off foam throughout cooking. Simmer over very low heat about
3 hours. Let stand to cool slightly and strain. Remove any meat from
bones and set aside. Chill stock until ready to use.
When ready to use, skim fat from top of stock. Heat to simmer. Add
carrots, potatoes and cabbage. Simmer, partly covered, until
vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. Add reserved meat from bones
and heat through. Season to taste with salt and garnish with parsley.
Makes 6 to 8 servings.
