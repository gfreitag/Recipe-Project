1 tb Double-concentrate tomato

In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil with the onion and
garlic over moderate heat. When they sizzle, add the chicken and
saute it, stirring and breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon,
until it begins to brown, 5 to 7 minutes.

Add the wine and stir and scrape well to deglaze the pan. Add the
tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands, and stir in the remaining
ingredients.

Simmer the sauce until thick but still slightly liquid, 20 to 25
minutes. Spoon over cooked pasta -- spaghetti, fettuccine or
medium-sized tubles, shells or other shapes are recommended.

Directions for roasting bell peppers:
~------------------------------------
Place the peppers in a foil-lined baking sheet in a 500 degree oven.
Roast until their skins are evenly blistered and browned, about 25
minutes, turning them 2 or 3 times so they roast evenly. Remove them
from the oven and cover them with a kitchen towel.

When the peppers are cool enough to handle, pull out their stems, peel
away their blackened skins; open the peppers up; and remove their
seeds, using a teaspoon to pick up any stray ones.

Take care not to lose any of the peppers' juices, which are also very
flavorful. You might want to pour them through a fine mesh strainer to
remove any seeds or bits of skin.
