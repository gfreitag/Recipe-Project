then pure them. In a large bowl place the jalape¤o chile peppers,
bread crumbs, milk, salt, and pured onions.  Gently mix the
ingredients together so that they are well blended. In a medium bowl
place the egg, egg white, and heavy cream. Whisk the ingredients
together. Add the oil and ground turkey, and mix them in with your
hands.  Add the cilantro and mix it in. Add the bread crumb mixture,
and mix it in well with your hands. Shape the meat mixture into 8
patties that are the size of the bread slices. Preheat the oven to
350øF. Place the patties in a baking pan and bake them for 10 minutes
on each side, or until they are firm. On each slice of the bread
place a slice of cheese and tomato.  Place the bread slices under a
preheated broiler until the cheese has melted. Place one baked
sausage patty on top of each grilled bread piece.  Top it with the
Southwestern Slaw. Serve the Black Bean Relish on the side.
