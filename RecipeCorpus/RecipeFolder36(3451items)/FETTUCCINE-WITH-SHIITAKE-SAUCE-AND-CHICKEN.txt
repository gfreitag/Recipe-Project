Place dried mushrooms in medium bowl.  Add hot water and let soak
until softened, about 30 minutes.  Remove mushrooms from water,
squeezing the excess water back into bowl.  Strain and reserve
liquid.  Slice mushrooms, discarding stems.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add bacon and
chicken and cook until fat renders, stirring frequently, about 3
minutes.  Add dried and fresh mushrooms and rosemary and saute 3
minutes.  Pour off half of fat.  Add shallots to bacon in skillet and
saute 1 minute.  Add dried and fresh mushrooms and rosemary and saute
3 minutes.  Add stock and mushroom-soaking liquid.  Boil until
reduced to a glaze, about 10 minutes.
Add half-and-half and simmer until beginning to thicken, about 5
minutes.
Remove from heat (can be prepared 3 days ahead, cover and
refrigerate.) Add pasta to large pot of boiling salted water.  Cook
until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, rewarm mushroom sauce over medium-low heat.
Drain pasta.  Add to sauce and stir until coated.  Mix in 2/3 cup
parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to plates.  Sprinkle
with parsley.  Serve immediately with garlic toasts, passing
additional parmesan separately (see recipe for garlic toasts).
