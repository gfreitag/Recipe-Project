Title: SIMPLE RICE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Oil
1 tb Margarine
Soy sauce or Hot sauce
Cooked rice
1    Onion, minced
1 c  Cabbage, chopped
2 tb Brown sugar
This is so simple there are really no rules on how much of any of the
ingredients you need. Just adjust to your own taste.
Cook the rice in your normal manner, but add a little soy sauce to the
water. (I prefer a few dashes of hot sauce) Dice the onion and
cabbage and fry in a small amount of oil. Add the brown sugar, garlic
and margarine. Stir this around for a while and then add it to the
cooked rice.
