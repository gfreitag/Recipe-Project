MMMMM-----------------WHERE THE WREATH CAME FROM----------------------
The wreath was an early Roman and Greek symbol of victory and glory;
however, it wasn't long before it began to figure prominently in
Christianity.  According to the preaching of early missionaries, when
Christ was crowned with thorny holly branches, the berries, then white
changed to blood red.  As a result of this legend, the use of holly,
in the form of wreaths, became popular at Christmas time.  Soon a
lighted candle was placed in the center of the wreath to remind
people of the new Light of the World, Jesus, born on Christmas Day.
And so the wreath, a pagan symbo of victory and glory, plus the
candle to signify the Light of the World, fulfills the promise of the
Old Testament reminding us that the Lord would come as the Light of
the World to bring the promised day of glory.
