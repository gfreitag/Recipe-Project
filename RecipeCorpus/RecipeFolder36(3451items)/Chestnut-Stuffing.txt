Title: Chestnut Stuffing
Categories: Holiday, Poultry, Dress/stuff, Nuts/grains
Yield: 10 servings
1    To 2 lbs of Chestnuts
2    4 raw eggs
-Salt and Pepper
-Poultry seasoning
15    To 20 lb. Turkey
1    To 2 loafs of white bread
3    To 4 medium chopped onions
1 pk Fresh mushrroms
1/2    To 1 lb. bulk sausage
The amounts depend on the size of turkey...

To cook chestnuts, make an x cut on the top of each chestnut, put
under the broiler until the cut (x) on top opens up- ~15 min.  Peel
the chestnuts while they are still hot (you will probably burn your
fingers a little but they are easier to peel when hot then cold).
When all peeled, chop up the chestnuts and set aside.

Back to the stuffing... Saute onions and mushrooms together in
margarine. Cook sausage separately and drain. In large bowl break
bread into thumb-size pieces. Use 1 1/2 loaves of bread; reserve rest
of bread to see if needed later.

Add onions, mushrooms and sausage to bread mix well.  Add chestnuts to
bread mix.  Then add raw eggs to mixture.  Here is the real trick: add
enough eggs to make the mixture just gooey enough to stuff- not too
gooey or you won't want to eat it (remember the turkey will also add
juices to moisten up the stuffing some).  If you add too many eggs,
add more bread.

Add Salt and pepper and poultry seasoning to taste, mix well!  Stuff
the turkey right before cooking.

This recipe might seem hard, but it you try it, it will be well worth
it!
