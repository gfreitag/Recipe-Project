Title: Curried Mushroom Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Sugar
1 ts Spanish paprika
1 tb White wine vinegar
Heavy cream
Salt
Creme frache or sour cream
2 lb Domestic mushrooms
Pref small caps
1 md Onion(s), thinly sliced
2 tb Soy sauce
2 c  Half-and-half
1 tb Curry powder
Separate the stems and caps of the mushrooms. Set stems aside. Place
1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over high heat and add the mushroom
caps. Bring the water to a boil, then lower to a simmer, add the
onion, and cover tightly. Let the mushroom "sweat" for 5-7 min.

While the caps are cooking, combine the soy sauce, mushroom stems,
1/3 cup half-and-half, curry powder, sugar, paprika, and vinegar in a
blender or food processor and process until you have a smooth, fairly
thick puree.

Place the puree and mushrooms in a soup pot, along with the remaining
half-and-half, adding just enough cream to desired thickness. Heat
until warmed through, and season with salt to taste. Ladle into
individual soup bowls and serve with a dollop of creme frache or
sour cream.
