This method of preparing mushrooms in excellent for any kind of fresh
mushroom, but is particularly suited to those varieties with less
assertive flavors.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and
garlic and saute until the onion becomes translucent, about 3 min.

Add the mushrooms, and saute, stirring occasionally, for 3 min. The
mushrooms will begin to give off liquid; do not let the mushrooms
cook so rapidly that all the liquid evaporates. Once the mushroom
liquid just covers the mushrooms, add the ham and cook for 10 min
over low heat.

Stir in the cram, soy sauce, and sherry and return to a light simmer,
then reduce heat and simmer for 6 min.

Stir the parsley into the mushrooms, then add some of the cornstarch
mixture a little bit at a time until the sauce has thickened. You may
not need to use add of the cornstarch. Add salt to taste.

Spoon into pastry shells and serve.
