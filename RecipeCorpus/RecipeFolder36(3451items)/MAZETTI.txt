8 oz Wide egg noodles, uncooked

4    Celery ribs, chopped
- (1 1/2 cups)
1 lg Garlic clove, crushed
12 oz Corn, undrained (1 can)

"This is the kind of recipe that can be varied as long as the soup is
included and enough other liquid is added.  It can be jazzed up with
other veggies, and red and green pepper add color.  For a Tex-Mex
version, add canned chopped chiles and chopped black olives, chili
powder and cumin. Although the cheese can be left off, it tastes
better with it."
