Chop the onions, peppers and garlic.  Saute them in olive oil until
the onions are browned.  Throw in the Beef and continue cooking until
the beef is browned.  When done, throw the mixture along with all of
the other ingredients, into a crock pot or stewing pot.  In the crock
pot cook for 6 to 10 hours.  In the stew pot cook covered for about
an hour and a half.  If more liquid is needed I like to add beer, but
red wine is great too.  Edited by J. White.
