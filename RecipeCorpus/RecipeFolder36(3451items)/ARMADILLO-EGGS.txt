Title: ARMADILLO EGGS
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs, Tex/mexican
Yield: 15 servings
1    Egg
1 pk Pork flavor Shake 'n Bake
20    Whole jalapeno peppers**
1/2 lb Monterey Jack Cheese
1/2 lb Sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 lb Hot pork sausage*
1 1/2 c  Bisquick mix
*Jimmy Dean Sausage brand is best **Use 20-30 peppers-may use fresh,
but success reported when using
bottled or canned

Slice peppers in half lengthwise and scrape out all the seeds (wear
gloves).  Try to keep both halves near each other as you have to put
them back together later. Mix bisquick, raw sausage & cheddar cheese.
Stuff each pepper with Monterey Jack cheese and put the halves back
together. Grab a handful of bisquick mixture and mold around pepper in
shape of elongated egg. Use enough to cover pepper wiell. Dip
armadillo egg in beaten egg and roll in Shake 'n Bake.  Bake on
broiler pan (can use cookie sheet) at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or
until crisp.
