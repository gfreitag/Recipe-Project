Title: Chicken Fried Steak
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1    Egg, beaten with
2 tb Water
Milk
Oil for frying
4    Round steaks
(about 1/3 lb. EACH)
Flour, seasoned with
-salt, pepper, garlic powder
Beat the steaks very well with a meat pounder (they should be almost
falling apart).  Dip first in the flour, then in the egg, and again
in the flour.  For a really crisp crust, dip again in the egg, and
the flour.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan (the oil should be to a depth of
1/4 inch or so).  Fry the steaks in the oil until nicely browned.
Remove and keep warm.

Drain all but 3 Tbsp of oil from the pan, being sure to leave the
crusty bits on the bottom in the pan.  Add 3 Tbsp. of flour (leftover
from breading the meat), and stir to make a white roux.

Whisk in 1 1/2 to 2 cups of milk,  and stir until the mixture loses
its floury taste.  Season to taste with salt and a generous amount of
black pepper (the pepper flavor is important in this dish).

Serve the gravy over the meat and with mashed potatoes.
