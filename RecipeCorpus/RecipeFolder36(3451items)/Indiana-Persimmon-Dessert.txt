No Ingredients Found
Persimmons were one of the popular fruits of the early Hoosiers.  The
variety grown in Indiana is not to be confused with the Japanese
persimmon, grown and marketed from California.  The Hoosier plumlike
yellow persimmon probably came from Virginia.  While green itis very
astringent and puckers the mouth, but when ripe it is sweet and
delicious in pies and puddings.
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1 cup pureed ripe persimmon pulp
1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
1/4 pound large marshmallows, cut into quarters

Mix all together.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  Serve with
whipped cream.  Makes 4-6 servings.
