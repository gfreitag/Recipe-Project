Okay... Now that Al's left the room, maybe we can get down to
some serious discussion of squid cooking...

Squid isn't tough when correctly prepared. Here are a few
basic rules to keep in mind followed by squid recipes from all
over the world.
From the International Squid Cookbook...
"When heated, squid protein becomes firm rapidly and then
turns chewy until long cooking breaks down the muscle.  Much of
the squid's reputation as a tough food comes from lack of
knowledge of this simple fact.  Sautes should be cooked no
longer than three minutes and stews no less than twenty minutes.
Squid cooked for less than twenty minutes or more than about
three minutes probably will be tough.  If you don't believe me,
just try it.
Squid absorbs water quickly from marinades and sauces.  Thus
it can be prepared rapidly and still acquire all the flavoring of
its accompaniments.  Marinades do help the flavor of squid, but
only up to a point.  Squid should never be marinated too long.
Half an hour is probably the optimum time.  After that, the meat
starts to soften and may even take on a bitter taste if lemon or
vinegar is used.
Squid, like any seafood, is fragile.  It should be refriger-
ated until just before use to keep it as fresh as possible.
The dark ink of the squid is its means of defense.  It
shoots it at intruders who venture too close, creating an obscur-
ing cloud behind which the squid makes a quick getaway.  The ink
itself is a salty, black liquid which makes an excellent flavor-
ing for sauces.  It is, not surprisingly, water soluble.  Don't
worry if you get ink on your hands or clothes.  It washes right
out."
