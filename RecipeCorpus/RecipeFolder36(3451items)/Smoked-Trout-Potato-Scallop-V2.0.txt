Title: Smoked Trout Potato Scallop V2.0
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Bbq/grill, Potatoes, Casseroles
Yield: 6 servings
1 ds Garlic powder
1 c  Thin white sauce
1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
1 tb Butter
3/4 lb Hot smoked lake trout
2 c  Potatoes; cooked*, sliced
2 tb Onion; grated
1/2 ts Louisiana hot sauce
Salt and pepper
* The potatoes should be boiled until _almost_ cooked, but still
have a "bone" in the centre. They will finish in the oven.

Arrange alternate layers of sliced potatoes, onion, and flaked fish
in a buttered casserole. Season each layer with hot sauce, garlic,
salt and pepper. Add the white sauce; sprinkle with crumbs and dot
with butter. Bake at 375 for 20 min until browned.
