Title: Pumpkin Seed Parmesan Risotto
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Arborio rice
1 c  Dry white wine
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 c  Toasted pumpkin seeds
6 c  (to 8 cups) chicken stock
4 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1 lg Yellow onion(s), peeled
Finely chopped
1 md Bay leaf
Place the chicken in a large saucepan and heat to a simmer. Keep warm.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over moderately high heat.
Add the add the onion and bay leaf. Saute until the onion is soft but
not browned, about 2 min. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly,
for about 3 min. Immediately stir in the wine and reduce the heat to
medium. Continue to stir until the wine is absorbed, then add 1 cup
of the hot stock. Cook, stirring constantly, until the stock is
absorbed. Continue stirring and adding stock in  1/2-cup portions,
allowing each  1/2 cup to become fully absorbed before adding more,
until the rice is tender yet retains its shape. This will take about
15 min.

Remove the pan from the heat and discard the bay leaf. Fold in  1/2
cup of the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan
and let sit for 2 min.

Spoon the risotto into individual heatproof serving bowls or one large
heatproof bowl and top with the remaining Parmesan. Place the bowl(s)
under a broiler for 30 seconds to melt the cheese. Remove from the
oven. Top each serving with pumpkin seeds, place under the broiler,
and cook to a light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Serve immediately.
