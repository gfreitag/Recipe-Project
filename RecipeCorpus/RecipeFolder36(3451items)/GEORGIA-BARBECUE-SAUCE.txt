Title: GEORGIA BARBECUE SAUCE
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
3 tb Prepared yellow mustard
2    Or 3 cloves Garlic; minced
1    Lemon; cut in halves
1 1/2 c  Catsup
1 c  Cider vinegar
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
In a saucepan, combine catsup, vinegar, oil, Worcestershire sauce,
brown sugar, mustard, and garlic. Squeeze lemon juice into sauce and
add 1 lemon half shell. Heat slowly for about 10 minutes. Sauce does
not have to reach the boil, but heating blends flavor. Use sparingly
as a basting sauce for fresh pork, ham, ribs, or chicken. Heat
additional sauce and serve as a table sauce. Makes about 3 cups.
