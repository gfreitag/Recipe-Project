Yield: 20 servings
2 tb Kirsch
2 tb Grand Marnier
1 ts Almond extract
1/2 c  Chopped natural almonds
1/2 c  Chopped glace cherries
-Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Baking powder
3    Large eggs
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Butter and flour a large baking
sheet. Mix the flour, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl. In a
small bowl, whisk together the eggs, kirsch, Grand Marnier, and
almond extract. Add this mixture to the flour mixture. Stir in the
almonds and cherries. Spoon the dough onto the prepared baking sheet
and form it into a strip about 10 inches long, 5 inches wide, and 1/2
inch thick. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until set
and firm to the touch. The dough shouldn't be hard. Remove from the
oven and slice diagonally with a serrated knife into 1/2-inch slices.
(Discard the thick end pieces.) Arrange the slices on the baking
sheet and return to the oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until lightly
brown. Let the biscotti cool for about 5 minutes on the baking sheet,
then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an
airtight container for up to 2 weeks. Makes 20 cookies. Source: "An
