Soak undrained cherries and kirsch in small bowl 6 hours. Thoroughly

cherry syrup to cherry liquid to measure 1 cup. Pour 6 tablespoons
into heavy 8-inch skillet (reserve remaining liquid for filling).
Halve cherries and add to skillet. Boil until syrup is thickened and
mixture resembles preserves, about 6 minutes. (Can be prepared 2 days
ahead. Chill.)

Generously butter 9-inch springform pan. Finely crush cookies in
processor, using on/off turns. Cut in butter until mixture begins to
gather together, using on/off turns. Press crumbs into bottom of pan
and up sides to 3/4 inch from top; there should be no cracks.
Refrigerate crust for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Heat 1 1/2 cups cream with chocolate in
heavy medium saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts, stirring
constantly. Cool 10 minutes.

Beat cream cheese with 3/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs 1 at
a time until just combined. Beat in chocolate mixture, then remaining
10 tablespoons cherry liquid and vanilla. Pour into crust. Bake until
outer 2 inches of cake are firm but center still moves slightly,
about 1 1/4 hours (top may crack). Cool completely on rack. Top pan
with paper towels and cover tightly with foil. Refrigerate 1 to 2
days.

Remove foil, paper towels and pan sides from cake. Spread cherry
topping over cake. Beat remaining 1 cup cream with 2 tablespoons
sugar and kirsch to peaks. Spoon into center of cake. Top with
chocolate curls if desired. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead and
refrigerated.) Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before
serving.
