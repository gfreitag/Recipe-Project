sides. Drain mushrooms and add to skillet.  Stir in flour.  Add soup,
wine, and water; cook, stirring, about 10 minutes, until sauce
thickens. Stir in dry milk, salt, tarragon, and pepper. Drain
artichoke hearts. Chop green onions. Mix in artichoke hearts, green
onions, and parsley. Heat through and serve over rice. For heartier
