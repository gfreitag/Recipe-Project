Categories: Breads, Fruit, Nuts/grains, Diabetic, Holiday
Yield: 15 servings
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Margarine
2 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Almond Extract
1 ts Lemon Rind, grated
1    To 1-1/2 cup Flour
1/2 c  Sliced Blanched Almonds
1/2 c  Low-Sugar Apricot Preserves
Ingredients:
1/2 c  Raisins, dark or golden
1/4 c  Dried Apricots, chopped
1/4 c  Unsweetened Apple Juice -or-
-Rum
1 pk (or 1 tablespoon) Active Dry
-Yeast
1/3 c  Milk, heated to lukewarm
-(105 to 110 degrees)
Combine the raisins, apricots and apple juice (or rum) in a bowl.  Let
soak overnight or for at least 4 hours.
Combine the yeast, milk and the 1/2 cup of flour in a bowl.  Mix until
smooth and the mixture looks like think mashed potatoes.  Cover the
bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for 10 minutes,
or until doubled in bulk.

Meanwhile, cream the margarine, sugar, salt, almond extract and lemon
rind. Beat in the yeast mixture and 1-1/4 cups of the flour.  Turn the
dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead in about 1/4 cup
more flour, or until the dough is soft.  Knead for 3 minutes.  Put in
a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place
until doubled, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

Once the dough has doubled, knead in the raisin mixture and almonds.
Knead until well mixed.  Roll the dough into a rectangular 12- by
6-inch shape. Roll up jelly roll fashion.  Place on a lightly-oiled
baking sheet and let rise about 30 minutes.  Bake in a 375-degree
oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.

Cool partially on a wire rack.  Glaze the cool but not cold stollen
with the apricot preserves.
