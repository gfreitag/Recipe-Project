Marinade: Combine all ingredients for marinade and then divide
between two large baggies. Place baggies in large bowl and add 4
trout to each baggie. Seal baggies tightly. Turn baggies a few times
to make sure all fish surfaces touch marinade. Let sit at room
temperature for 1 hour. Remove fish from marinade and salt and pepper
each liberally inside and out. Arrange fish on greased foil paced on
prepared grill. Sprinkle fish with cheese and press to adhere to
fish. Cook for about 6-8 minutes or until fish flakes. Serve
immediately on heated plates. Adapted from Grourmet Fish on the Grill
