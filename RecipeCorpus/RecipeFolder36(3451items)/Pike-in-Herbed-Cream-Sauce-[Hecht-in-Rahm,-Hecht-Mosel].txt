Categories: Aust/german, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 2 servings
1 1/2 c  Sweet cream
Salt
1 pn Mace
6    Anchovy fillets; chopped or
2 ts Anchovy paste
1 tb Lemon peel; grated
1    Egg yolk; beaten with
2 tb White wine or cream
2 lb Pike, pickerel or
-perch; cut into fillets
2 tb Butter
1    Onion; minced
1 tb Parsley; minced
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  White wine or fish stock
2 tb Butter
3 tb Flour
Sprinkle fish with salt; let stand 30 min, rinse and dry. Heat butter
in a shallow casserole or a deep skillet with a cover. When butter is
bubbling, add onion and parsley and saute 3 min. lay fish on top of
vegetables, add bay leaf and enough wine or stock to just cover the
bottom of the pan. Cover and simmer 10 to 15 min. Baste twice while
cooking and add liquid as needed.

Preheat oven to 475. Melt butter and stir in flour. Cook, stirring,
about 4 min til flour starts to color. Add cream and whisk til smooth
and thickened. Add pan juices from fish, salt and mace. Remove fish
with a spatula to a buttered baking dish. Top fillets with anchovies
and lemon peel. Pour 2/3 sauce over fish. Place baking dish in a
larger pan full of hot water and cover the pans with foil so the fish
can steam. Bake this way 10 min. Add egg yolk beaten with cream or
wine to the remaining sauce, which should be hot but not boiling. Add
the yolk slowly while stirring. Heat to thicken but do not boil. Pour
this sauce over the fish and its original sauce.

Variation: Moselle Pike - Simmer the fish as above; cover with a
cheese sauce made of pan juices, cream and Parmesan. Do not use an
egg yolk; sprinkle dish with extra grated cheese and broil until
sauce is bubbling and browned.
