These rolls are similar to Lithuanian Lasinuociai but use
frozen bread dough instead of the traditional homemade dough.

For Filling, in a skillet cook bacon till crisp;  remove bacon,
reserving 1 Tablespoon drippings.  Drain bacon on paper towels;
crumble when cool.

In the same skillet cook onion, green pepper, dillweed, and
pepper in hot drippings till onion is tender but not brown. Cool.
Stir in bacon.

Divide bread dough into 30 portions.  Roll each portion into a
ball; roll or pat each ball into a 3-inch circle. Place a scant
Tablespoon of the filling in the center of each circle. Bring up
dough edges around the filling; seal the edges together.

Arrange filled rolls, seam side down, on a greased baking
sheet.  Brush with milk. Sprinkle with poppy seed, fennel seed,
or sesame seed.

Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or
till rolls are golden. Serve warm. Makes 30 rolls.

TO FREEZE;
Prepare and bake rolls as directed above.  Cool thoroughly on
a wire rack. Transfer rolls to a freezer container. Seal, label,
and freeze for up to 4 months. To reheat, arrange frozen rolls on
an ungreased baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F
oven about 15 minutes or till rolls are heated through.
