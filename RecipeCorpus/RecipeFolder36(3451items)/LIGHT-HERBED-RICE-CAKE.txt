"For a picnic, serve these squares of cheese, and other herb-flavored
rice warm or at room temperature. They are also delicious eaten hot
with tomato sauce and thin slices of cold rare roast lamb or beef."
Preheat oven to 350F.
In a medium saucepan, combine rice, salt, and 2 cups water. Bring to a
boil over high heat. Cover tightly, reduce heat to lowest setting, and
cook for 15 to 18 minutes, or until rice is tender but still lightly
firm to the bite. Remove from heat and fluff rice with fork.
In a large mixing bowl, combine butter, cheese, onion, dill, parsley,
egg. milk, Tabasco and black pepper and blend well. Add rice and toss
to combine well.
Press mixture evenly into a lightly buttered 8 or 9 inch square baking
dish. Bake in the centre of the oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until
rice is beginning to brown lightly around the edges and becomes
crusty. Remove from oven and let cool for 20 minutes before cutting.
Run a small knife around the edges of dish and cut rice into 2-inch
squares.
