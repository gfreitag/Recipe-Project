Follow the directions on the package as to making the ordinary soup
with the water and milk. The package I used was "Creamy Clam" soup
mix by Mayacamas Fine Foods Inc. CA. USA. Make a roux with the flour
and butter in a seperate pot. Bring the soup mix to the boil and add
the curry powder, garlic powder and cummin. Add the can of baby
clams, stir until heated again then pour into the roux pot stirring
constantly until the soup thickens. Simmer for 10 minutes and serve.
