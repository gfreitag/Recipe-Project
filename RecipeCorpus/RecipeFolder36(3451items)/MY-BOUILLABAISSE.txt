3    Saffron threads
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Dried basil
1 ts Dried thyme
1 tb Salt (or more-fish is bland)
1 lb Red Snapper

1/4 ts Sugar
4 c  Doxee clam juice

Skin fish and cut into serving sized pieces.  Use fillets. Flounder or
other firm white fish may be substituted. *Reserve broth from steamed
clams for use in the bouillabaise. Heat olive oil in a lg. pot and
cook garlic and onion til soft over mod. heat. Add the leek and cook
for 10 min. Add tomatoes and sugar. Simmer 5 min. Add all rem.
ingred. except seafood and simmer 30 min., covered. Strain the broth
discarding the orange zest and bay leaf.  Puree the remaining veg.
with some of the broth and return it to the pot. Add the salt and
pepper adjusting to suit your taste. This portion can be refrigerated
or frozen at this point. Strain the broth from the steamed clams and
add to the pot. Add the clams (may be diced, if preferred). Add the
remaining seafood and the dark portion of the leek and simmer for 3-5
min. DO NOT OVERCOOK. Correct the seasonings. Ladle into bowls and
serve with garlic bread and Sauce Rouille. I do not serve the
shellfish in the shells as restaurants do due to the difficulty and
awkwardness in the ability for guests to eat it while "fiddling"
around with the shells. Recipe may be halfed. LISA CRAWLEY/CEDAR
