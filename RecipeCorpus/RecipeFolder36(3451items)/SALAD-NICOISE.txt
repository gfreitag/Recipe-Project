Cook potatoes in their jackets.  Just as soon as they can be handled,

To serve, toss green bean and potato slices together gently, adding
more Oil/Vinegar dressing to coat veggies if needed.  Mound in the
center of a large, chilled chop plate and arrange crisp salad greens
around the edges.

Arrange peeled and quartered tomatoes and eggs alternately around
potato salad.  Tuck olives between tomatoes and eggs.  Garnish top of
salad with anchovy strips.  Sprinkle salad with parsley.  If not
ready to serve, cover with foil and refrigerate.

At serving time, turn chilled tuna onto a chilled plate and garnish
with lemon quarters and greens.  Or, if you prefer, make clusters of
tuna chunks with the tomatoes and eggs around the salad.

Take  a cruet of the Oil/Vinegar dressing or a bowl of Mayonnaise to
the table.  Pass so the guests can add more dressing if desired.
