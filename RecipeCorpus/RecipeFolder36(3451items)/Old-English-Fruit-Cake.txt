MMMMM-------------------FROM : SUNSET MAGAZINE------------------------

-would leave this out
In this solid dark, old

Batter to hold the fruits
-and nuts together, and to
-absorb
The aroma of the liqueur
-that moistens the cloth in
-which it
Ages.(I would use Saran now)
1 lb Butter
1 lb Brown sugar
12 ea Eggs separated
4 c  Flour
citron is very strong tasting and this is what people usually
do not like in fruitcake.  Use candied pineapple instead.
1 pound broken walnuts
1 cup rum or brandy
1/2 cup double-strength coffee
grated peel and juice of 3 medium sized oranges
grated peel and juice of 1 lemon
Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add well
beaten egg
yolks and stir vigorously until smooth and creamy.  Sift flour,
measure, and
sift with spices.  Combine candied fruit, cherries, seeded raisins,
seedless
raisins, currants, dates, pineapple  and walnuts, and mix lightly
with 1 cup
of the spiced flour.  Add remaining flour to batter, blending
alternately with mixture of rum, coffee, and fruit peel and juices.
Add fruit and nut mixture and mix well. Beat egg whites until they
hold stiff peaks, then fold
into batter.  Butter 4 loaf pans (5 X 9) line with brown paper and
butter again, Spoon in batter.  Bake in a very slow oven 250 for 3
hours 30 minutes
or until a tooth pick inserted comes out clean.  (I would put a
shallow pan filled with water on the bottom shelf of the oven.)
