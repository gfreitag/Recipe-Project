Categories: Kooknet, Cake/cookie, Oldies, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Shortening, butter or..
..margarine
1 ts Vanilla
4    Egg whites
2 1/2 c  Flour
2 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1 1/3 c  Buttermilk or sour milk
Preheat oven to 350F. In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and 1/8 tsp. salt. Add buttermilk, shortening (butter or
margarine) and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping
bowl. Beat on medium to high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl
occasionally. ADd egg whites and beat for 2 minutes more, scraping
bowl.

Pour into 2 greased and floured 9 x 1/5 inch round baking pans. Bake
for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on wire
racks for 10 minutes. Loosen sides and remove from pans. Serves 12.

NOTE: One day my husband Pat wanted a marble cake. So, I improvised.
To make a marble cake from this recipe, simply reserve one third of
the cake batter before putting in the cake pans. Then, melt one
square unsweetened or semi-sweet chocolate either over boiling water
or in the microwave oven. Stir to blend. Add to the cake mixture and
mix well. Put one half of the chocolate batter in each cake pan in
dolops, and swirl carefully, so as not to mix the white batter with
the chocolate. What you are trying to achieve in a marble effect.
Bake as directed. (BTW, this is GREAT!!)
