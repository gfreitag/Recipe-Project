Title: El Pollo Loco Flame-Broiled  Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1    Clove garlic
1 ts Yellow food coloring
1    Frying chicken -- quartered
2 c  Water
4 ts Salt
2 ts Pepper
In a blender, combine the water, salt, pepper, garlic and food
coloring. Blend on high speed for 15 seconds.  Marinate the chicken
in the liquid in a bowl or pan for 45 minutes.  Turn and marinate for
30 minutes more. Preheat a clean barbecue to medium low grilling
heat.  Cook the chicken on the open grill for 45 minutes to 1 hour,
or until the skin is golden brown and crispy.  Be sure the flames are
not scorching the chicken, or the skin may turn black before the
center is done.  Lower the heat if necessary. Turn the chicken often
as it cooks.  Cut the chicken into 8 pieces, with a large, sharp
knife, cutting the breast in half and cutting the thighs from the
legs.
