Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them. Put beans in large
stockpot, cover with cold water, and soak for at least 3 hours, or
overnight.

Drain beans, return them to the stockpot and cover with fresh water.
Using the clove as a pin, attach the bay leaf to the whole onion. Add
the vegetable oil, studded onion, garlic, and spices to the pot and
cook gently, uncovered, over medium-low heat until the beans are
tender, 45 min to 1 hour. Drain the beans of excess liquid, then
return them to the pot. Discard the bay leaf, clove, and whole onion.
Add the sherry, oil, and vinegar and stir well to incorporate. Cover
and keep warm.

Grilled Red Onions:

With a sharp knife cut each onion crosswise into 6 slices, being
careful to keep the rings together. Pin each ring together with a
wooden skewer or long toothpick. Place the onion rings in a shallow
baking dish and set aside.

Warm the sherry in a small saucepan over low heat, add the sugar, and
stir until dissolved. Remove from heat and pour over the onion rings.
Let marinate for 20 min.

Bring a grill up to a high temperature. Place the onion on the grill
in a single layer and cook until well marked, about 3 min. Turn and
cook the other side. Keep warm. Repeat with remaining onions.

Remove the wooden skewers and serve as an accompaniment to kidney
beans with sherry.
