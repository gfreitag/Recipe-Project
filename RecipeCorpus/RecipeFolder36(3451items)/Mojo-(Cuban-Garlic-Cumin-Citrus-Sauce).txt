Title: Mojo (Cuban Garlic-Cumin-Citrus Sauce)
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Caribbean
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
1 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Dried oregano
2 ts Salt or to taste
1 ts Black pepper
3 tb Chopped cilantro
Or flat-leaf parsley
1/2 c  Olive oil
6 lg (to 8) garlic clove(s)
Very thinly sliced
Or finely chopped
2/3 c  Sour orange juice
Or lime juice
Heat the olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Add the
garlic and cook until fragrant and a pale golden brown. Do not let
brown too much, or the garlic will become bitter.

Stir in the lime juice,  1/2 cup water, cumin, oregano, salt and
pepper. Be careful; the sauce may sputter. Bring the sauce to a
rolling boil. Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste.
Let cool to room temperature, then stir in the cilantro.

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator; it will keep for
several weeks. Shake well before using.
