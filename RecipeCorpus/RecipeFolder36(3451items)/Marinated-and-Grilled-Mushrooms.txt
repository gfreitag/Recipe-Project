Title: Marinated and Grilled Mushrooms
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Sugar
1 sm Onion(s)
Finely chopped
1 ts Minced garlic
4 lg Portobellos
1/3 c  Wine vinegar
Pref infused with savory
2/3 c  Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
Prepare a charcoal grill.

Clean the mushrooms and slice off the stems; slice the stems
lengthwise.

Combine the vinegar, olive oil, salt, sugar, onion, and garlic in a
large bowl and stir well so that the salt and sugar dissolve. Then
add the mushroom caps and stems and let sit in the marinade for 15
min, basting frequently.

Remove the mushrooms from the marinade and grill for 3-4 min per side,
turning occasionally if the grill is very hot. Serve whole, with the
stems place back inside the caps.

Notes:
~ You can make this with any large-cap fresh mushrooms; porcini,
portobello, even large domestic.
~ If possible, make the marinade a day in advance and let it sit in a
cool place or in the refrigerator; let stand at room temperature for
30 min before using.
~ It can also be prepared in a 325 F oven for 7-9 min,, depending on
the size of the mushrooms.
