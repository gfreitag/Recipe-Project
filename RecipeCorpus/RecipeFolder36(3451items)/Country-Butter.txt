Title: Country Butter
Categories: Condiments, Dips/spread
Yield: 32 ounces
1 c  Buttermilk
1 lb Margarine, softened
1 c  Corn oil
1.  Whip ingredients together in a food processor or with an electric
mixer.  Stored in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator,
this spread will keep well for 1 month.

Note:  This is a clever way to stretch margarine, while at the same
time softening and enriching its flavor a bit.

Whipped Butter:  Useing the Country Butter or any purchased butter
you can save even more money by whipping it yourself.  First, let the
butter warm to room temperature and place it in a bowl that you have
nestled in a bed of ice cubes.  Whip the butter at high speed until
it begins to harden harden again and lighten in color.  Scrape the
sides of the bowl often and stop when the butter begins to stick to
the beaters.  You can add herbs, spices, honey or other flavorings at
this point if you wish.  Scrape the butter into a crock or plastic
container, cover, and refrigerate.  Butter will keep for 3 weeks.
