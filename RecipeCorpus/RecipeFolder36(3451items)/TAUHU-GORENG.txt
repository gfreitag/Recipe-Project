them out and let them cool.

Then cut each cake into 2 pieces and make a deep slit across the

For the sauce, pound or blend the chilis and garlic together.  Then
add the soy sauce, vinegar and salt.  Next put in the ground peanuts
and add the water a little at a time.  Stir to make a smooth coating
sauce.

Arrange the stuffed bean-curd/tofu cakes on a dish garnished with
slices of cucumber and fresh cilantro leaves and pass the peanut
sauce separately.
