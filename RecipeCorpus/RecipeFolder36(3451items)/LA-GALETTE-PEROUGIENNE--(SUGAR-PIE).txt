Categories: Pie/tart, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
3/4 ts Salt
6 tb Chilled unsalted butter
1    Whole egg
1    Egg yolk
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/3 c  Lukewarm water
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Sugar
Grated zest of 1/2 lemon
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Sugar
5 tb Frozen unsalted butter
1. Combine the yeast and a pinch of sugar with the lukewarm water and
stir until the yeast dissolves.  Let stand for about 5 minutes, or
until foamy. If the yeast doesn't foam, begin again with fresh
ingredients. 2.  Place the flour, sugar, zest and salt in a food
processor.  Process, turning the motor on and off several times, to
mix well.  Remove the processor top and slice the butter by 1/2
tablespoonfuls, into the container.  Turn the machine on and off
serveral times, until the bits of butter are no longer discernible.
3.  Lightly beat together the egg and egg yolk.  With the motor
running, add the yeast mixture to the processor and immediately add
the egg. Process for 45 seconds to knead the dough.
4.  Form the dough into a ball and set it in a lightly floured bowl.
Sprinke the top of the ball lightly with flour.  Cover the bowl with
plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for about 1 1/2 hours,
or until doubled in bulk.
5.  Preheat the overn to 425 degrees.  Adjust the oven racks to both
the lowest and highest positions in the oven.  Place the dough on a
lightly floured surface and flatten evenly with your hand.  With a
rolling pin, gradually press out the dough into a 19-inch circle.
Fold the dough in quarters, center the point in a 17-inch pizza pan,
and unfold the dough to cover the pan.  Fold a 1/2-inch rim of dough
inward to make a neat border, and make a decorative edge.
6.  Make the topping:  With a swivel-bladed peeler or sharp knife,
shave the frozen butter evenly over the dough, right out to, but not
on, the border.  Sprinkle with the sugar.
7.  Set the galette on the lower oven rack and bake for about 6
minutes, or until the border is lightly browned and the surface
bubbles.  Increase the heat to 475 degrees and move the pan to the
higher oven rack.  Bake for about 4 minutes, or until the top surface
is browned in parts. 8.  Slice into wedges and serve.  The galette
should be eaten while hot and soft.
