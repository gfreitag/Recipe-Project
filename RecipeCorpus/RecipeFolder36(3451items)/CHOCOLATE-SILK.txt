Title: CHOCOLATE SILK
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Evaporated Skim Milk
2/3 c  Whole Milk
2    Jumbo Egg Yolks
- lightly beaten
2 ts Vanilla Extract
6 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
2 tb Sifted Cornstarch
1 ts Unflavored Gelatin
1 c  Half-and-Half
MMMMM----------------------OPTIONAL TOPPING---------------------------
- OR -
6    Candied Violets
1/4 c  Heavy Cream; whipped
1 tb Chopped blanched Pistachios
In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and gelatin,
pressing out all lumps.  Add the half-and-half, evaporated skim milk
and whole milk; whisk vigorously to blend.  Set the pan over
moderately low heat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden,
until the mixture just boils and is thickened and smooth, about 10
minutes.

Blend a little of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks, then
stir the warmed egg yolks back into the pan.  Cook over moderately
low heat, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes.  The mixture must
not boil or the eggs will scramble.  Remove from the heat and stir in
the vanilla.  Set the saucepan on a rack to cool for 10 minutes,
stirring frequently to prevent a skin from forming on the surface.

Ladle the mixture into 6 decorative 4-ounce pot de crÂŠme cups or white
porcelain ramekins and let cool completely.  Cover each cup with
plastic wrap, then refrigerate at least 5 hours, or overnight.

Serve as is or top each serving with a little of the whipped cream and
either a scattering of chopped pistachios or a single candied violet.
