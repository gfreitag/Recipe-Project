Title: ARDSHANE HOUSE IRISH STEW
Categories: Scot/irish, Main dish, Meats, Oldies
Yield: 6 servings
2 oz Pearl barley
2 pt Beef stock
Salt and pepper to taste
4 lb Middle neck of lamb, cut in
One inch chunks
4 lb Potatoes, peeled
10 sm Onions, sliced
"That's the basic recipe. You can add a load of sliced carrots and
leeks to make it go further and about 5-6 tsps. of Worchestershire
sauce or regular brown sauce wot you Yanks pour over everything!! If
you like, you could add a half a pint of Guinness to your stock. I
make my stock from the potato peelings, carrot tops, leek ends, and
any other stuff I find lurking in the refrigerator. If you chuck in a
few moldy lamb bones and boil/simmer for several hours, you should
get a damned good stock (strain the liquid or you'll get God knows
what stuck in your teeth!!) You'll need to start with about 5 pints
of liquid. Then bung everything into a ginormous pan, bring to the
boil, and then simmer for about two hours...should taste bloody
orgasmic! Salt and pepper to taste, depending on your level of
drunkeness!!"
