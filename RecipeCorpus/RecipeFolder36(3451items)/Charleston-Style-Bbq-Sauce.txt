Categories: Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 2 cups
MMMMM---------------------HOUSTON CHRONICLE--------------------------
1/2 c  Catsup
4 ts Chili powder
1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Cider vinegar
Combine ingredients in small saucepan and bring to boil.  Simmer until
reduced to thick sauce, stirring occasionally.

Sylvia's comments: tangy brown BBQ sauce.  Even though I forgot the
chili powder, this was way too tangy for my taste.
