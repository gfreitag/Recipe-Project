Title: Candy Cane Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 30 medium
4 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Peppermint candy
Red food colouring
2 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
4 x  Egg yolks
2 ts Vanilla
Cream together butter and sugar.  Add egg yolks and vanilla and mix
well. Sift flour and salt together and beat into butter mixture until
well mixed.
When ready, divide dough in half.  To one half, add 1/2 ts. red food
colouring.  Using about a tablespoon of dough, roll a 4" strip of each
colour (no fatter than a pencil).  Place the two coloured rolls
side-by-side and press lightly together.  Gently twist like a rope and
place on an ungreased cookie sheet 1" apart.
Curve the top like a candy cane and bake in a pre-heated oven at 350
F. for about 15 minutes; do not brown.
Sprinkle with crushed peppermint candy before cool.
Makes 20-30 medium cookies.
Personal Note:  After trial and error, I found that it is easier to
take each tablespoon of cookie dough and roll in hands to form rough
cylinder. Then put on flat surface vertically.  Using fingers and
palm in same direction, gently roll left and right until the size of
a pencil. (the dough, that is):)  Pick a time to do these cookies
when you're feeling creative and have patience.  It's fun and they
are yummy!  The end product is worth the trouble.
