Title: Stuffed Meatloaf
Categories: Meats, Dress/stuff, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Barbecue sauce, divided
1    Egg, beaten
1 1/2 lb Lean ground hamburger
2/3 c  Bread crumbs
Stove top stuffing, long grain and wild rice flavour
1 pkg (300 gram) frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry, chopped
1 large carrot, grated
2 cups Monterey Jack cheese, grated

Combine the hamburger, bread crumbs 1/2 cup bbq sauce and egg.  Mix
well and spread onto sheet of waxed paper.  Place another sheet of
waxed paper over top and press or roll out until meat is about 15 x
10. Prepare stuffing mix but add the grated carrot and the chopped
spinach. Spread stuffing mix evenly over top of meat (removing top
layer of waxed paper). Sprinkle grated cheese on top of stuffing.
Pat down.  Start rolling the meat, using the bottom sheet of waxed
paper to help keep the meat from breaking apart. Once rolled up,
securely wrap with plastic wrap, or waxed paper.  Chill for several
hour or overnight.  Bake in a 350 F oven for about an hour. Baste
with the remaining 1/2 cup barbecue sauce and cook for another 15 -
20 minutes, or until done.  Makes 8
