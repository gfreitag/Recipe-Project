Title: Chocolate Pecan Shortbread
Categories: Chocolate, Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 24 servings
1/2 c  Pecans -- Coarsely Chopped
1 3/4 c  (12 Oz) M&Ms Semi-Sweet
Chocolate Baking Bits,
Divided
1 tb (To 2) Milk
1 c  Butter -- Softened
1/4 c  Granulated Sugar
1/4 c  Light Brown Sugar -- Firmly
Packed
1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
Preheat oven to 375 F (350 F for glass).
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy; blend in vanilla. Add
flour and mix only until blended. DOUGH WILL BE STIFF. Stir in pecans
and 1 cup of the baking bits. Press dough into 13 x 9-inch pan.
Sprinkle top with 1/3 cup baking bits; press lightly into dough. Bake
18 to 20 mins or until light golden brown. Cool completely. Drizzle
with Chocolate Glaze (recipe follows). Cut into bars.
Makes 24 bars.

CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Place remaining Baking Bits (I would use regular
chocolate chips) in a microwave proof container; add 1 Tbs milk. Heat
1 min on HIGH; stir until chocolate is completely melted and mixture
is smooth; add additional milk to reach desired consistency. Pour
mixture into a zipper-type plastic sandwich bag; close tightly,
removing all air. Snip a tiny piece off one corner of the bag (not
more than 1/8-inch). Holding top of bag tightly, drizzle glaze on
shortbread in desired pattern.
