Title: Wild Rice and Bulgur Stuffing
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 8 cups
1 c  Bulgur
1/2 c  Pecans, toasted
Coarsely chopped
1 c  Golden raisins
1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
Black pepper to taste
1 1/2 ts Canola or vegetable oil
3    Stalks celery, chopped
2    Onion(s), chopped
2    Garlic clove(s), minced
1 c  Wild rice
3 c  Chicken stock
1/2 ts Salt plus more to taste
In a heavy saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add celery, onions,
and garlic; saute for about 5 min, or until softened. Stir in wild
rice. Add chicken stock and  1/2 tsp salt and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to low, cover and simmer for 40-45 min, or until the rice is
tender and the liquid has been absorbed.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, cover bulgur with 2 cups water. Let soak for 30
min.

In a small saucepan, cover raisins with water and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 min. Drain and set aside.

Stir the soaked bulgur, pecan, raisins, and parsley into the cooked
wild rice. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool completely before
stuffing.

To use as a side dish, bake in a lightly oiled covered casserole in a
325 F oven for 35-45 min, or until heated through. If you want a
crisp top for bread stuffing, remove the cover for the last 15 min of
baking.

Makes enough to stuff one 12-lb turkey or to serve 8 as a side dish.
