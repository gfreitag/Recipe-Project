Categories: Main dish, Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2    Slices bread
1    Egg
1/4 c  Water
2 cn Tomatoes
1 c  Sugar
2    Lemons
Dash pepper
1    Large head of cabbage
1    Large onion, chopped
6    Small carrots
3    Stalks celery
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Tomato juice
1 lb Hamburger
Core cabbage and place in large saucepan.  Cover cabbage with water
and boil until cabbage is softened.  Drain off water.  Set aside
copped onion, pared carrots, and cut celery stalks in halves.  In a
small bowl, dampen bread with water.  Add hamburger, egg, salt and
pepper.  Mix together well.  Slice thick stem base off cabbage
leaves.  Place some meat misture on leaf.  Fold and roll, place seam
side down in saucepan.  On top of cabbage rolls, place onions,
carrots, and celery.  Pour tomatoes and tomato juice over all.
Carmelize 1 cup sugar in heavy skillet.  Add to cabbage roll mixture.
Juice 2 lemons and add as final ingredient.  Simmer 2 hours uncovered.
This recipe says sauce pan but I used a 13" cake pan.  It doesn't
specify degrees, so I picked 350.  ???  The cake pan holds the rolls
and then the carrots and celery can be decorative by laying them
horizontally, alternating.  It makes a pretty dish.  And it is good.
Well worth the effort.
