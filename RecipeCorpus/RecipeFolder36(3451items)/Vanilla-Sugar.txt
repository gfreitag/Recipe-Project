Title: Vanilla Sugar
Categories: Condiments, Information
Yield: 16 ounces
2 ea Vanilla beans
2 c  Sugar
1.  Place the sugar in an airtight canister or jar with a tightly
fitting cover.  Using kitchen shears or sturdy scissors, cut the
vanilla bean into three or four pieces, working directly over the jar
or container so that all the little black seeds will drop into the
sugar. 2.  Cover and store for 2 to 4 weeks before using.  Remove the
beans and whirl in the blender for 1 minute if you have lumps in the
sugar. Additional plain sugar may be added to the container as you
use the Vanilla Sugar until you notice that the scent and flavor are
gone.

Tip:  To make this recipe a little more economical, you might consider
using the expensive vanilla beans first to make Vanilla Bean Extract
(included in this series), and then after a few weeks, remove them
from the extract and add them to the sugar.  Then you will have two
lovely vanilla-flavored items in your kitchen pantry for the price of
the vanilla beans.
