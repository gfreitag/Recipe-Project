Title: ROUX FLOUR
Categories: Cajun/creol
Yield: 1 servings
4 c  All purpose flour
This flour may be used in making that most basic of Cajun sauces, the
roux. All Cajun recipies calling for a sauce begin with "First you
make a roux". A normal roux is made with equal parts flour and oil,
with water or stock added when the roux is at the desired degree of
doneness.  This flour allows you to dispense with the oil and still
have the desired flavor.

Place the flour in a large skillet over high heat;  with a wire
whisk, stir constantly for 25 minutes or until the flour begins to
turn a light brown, similar to light brown sugar.  If the flour
begins to darken too fast, remove it from the heat and stir to allow
the flour to darken evenly before putting it back on a lower heat
setting.

When it has reached the desired color, remove from the heat and
continue stirring until completely cooled.  Sift the flour into a
covered container and store until needed.

note:  This will tire you out and must be done with no interruptions.
If the flour is burned, throw it out and start over.  It is actually
much harder than a true roux, but it is worth it to get the true
flavor of the cajun dishes.
