Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
14 oz Sweetened condensed milk
8 tb Lime juice, or more to taste
1    9-in pie shell
5    Egg yolks
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1    Lime, Grated rind only
1 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Confectioners' sugar
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Put the yolks in a large bowl and beat them
with a whisk, just breaking them and mixing them well. Slowly stir in
the condensed milk. Mixing well, stir in the lime juice. The mixture
should be tart--if it isn't pleasantly tangy, stir in more lime
juice. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Bake for about 12-to-15
minutes. Remove and cool. Whip the cream, slowly adding the
confectioners' sugar. Spread over the pie and sprinkle the lime rind
over. Serve at room temperature, but refrigerate if not serving
within 3 hours of baking.
