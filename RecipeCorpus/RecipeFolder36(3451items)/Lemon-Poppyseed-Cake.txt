Title: Lemon Poppyseed Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
(have used non-instant)
2 tb Poppy seeds -- (or more!)
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Cooking oil -- (e.g.,
-canola)
1 c  Water
1 pk Lemon supreme cake mix --
(Duncan Hines)

(I have used a yellow cake
-mix with fine results)
-results)
1 sm Pkg Instant lemon pudding --
MMMMM-------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
(confectioner's sugar)
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
Mix all ingredients.  Bake in a greased tube pan (Bundt pan) for 50
minutes at 350 degrees F.

Icing: Pierce the top of the cake generously and pour the icing on the
hot cake.

Note - the icing is very runny (it's not really an icing as much as
something to soak the cake in), so make sure you have a big plate
under your cake to collect the drippings.  The cake will soak it all
up and be very, very moist.  You can leave the cake in the pan, poke
holes in the bottom, and pour the icing over the bottom if you
prefer.  It will soak in a more controlled fashion.
