Title: Tom's Vegan Reduced Fat Double Chocolate Brownies
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
1    Banana
2 c  Sugar
1 1/3 c  Flour
2 c  Chocolate chips, semisweet
10 oz Applesauce
8 oz Cocoa powder, melted OR
-baking chocolate, melted
1/4 ts Salt
Beat the above with a fork until smooth.  Pour into a square 8x8 pan
for traditional square brownies.  Bake at 350 for 35 mins.
Tom's comment:  These are fantastic IMHO.  Not just "pretty good,"
WONDERFUL.  This may have something to do with the fact that there is
so much chocolate and there's still a significant amount of fat.  Oh
well, they're worth it.  They're intentionally sticky...people in
this household have been known to eat them for breakfast.  I won't
name names.
