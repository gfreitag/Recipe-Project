Title: Salsa Fresca/pico De Gallo
Categories: Vegetables, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 batch
-seeded and chopped or
2    Seranno chili peppers
1 c  Cilantro leaves,
-coarsly chopped (opt'l)
2 tb Bland salad oil (opt'l)
6    Roma tomatoes or
3    -regular tomatoes,
-seeded, and chopped
4    Green onions, chopped
Juice of two limes
3    Jalapeno peppers,
Combine the ingredients, and allow to sit for an hour or so to blend
the flavors.

All of the ingredients in this dish can be freely varied to suit the
individual cook's taste.  Some cooks also include a small, firm but
ripe avocado, cubed.

The mixture will keep under refrigeration for about a day, but I
wouldn't hold it much longer than that, and it's really best when
freshly made.
