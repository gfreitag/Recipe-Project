Freshen salt herring with milk: clean and wash herring and soak
overnight. Dry with paper towel. Combine wine and egg yolks and beat
until blended. Add flour gradually until a smooth batter is formed [
like a medium pancake batter]. Dip fish in batter; heat butter in a
large heavy skillet until foaming subsides. Add herring and fry over
moderate heat, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, 12-15
min.

Serve with sauerkraut, boiled potatoes and onion rings. From: The
