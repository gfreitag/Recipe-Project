Title: Sugar Cookie Jewels
Categories: Chocolate, Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 48 servings
1 3/4 c  M&Ms Baking Bits (Either
Flavor) -- (1- 12Oz
Package)
Granulated Sugar -- As
Needed
1 c  Butter Or Margarine
1 c  Granulated Sugar
1 lg Egg
1 ts Vanilla Extract
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 ts Baking Soda
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy; add egg and
vanilla. Combine flour and baking soda; add to creamed mixture just
until blended. Stir in M&M's Chocolate Baking Bits.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place on greased cookie sheets about
2-inches apart. With bottom of a glass dipped in sugar, flatten dough
very slightly so as not to crush baking bits. (NOTE: Very important
to keep the balls of dough small and just barely flattened because
these SPREAD out a lot.) Bake 10 to 12 mins or until edges are light
golden; let cool 1 minute before removing to wire racks to cool
completely. Store in tightly covered containers.
Makes 4 dozen.
