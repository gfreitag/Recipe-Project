The variable amounts of ingredients depend on your taste and on the
size of the eggplant. Try it without celery and red pepper and then
you can decide if you want to use it next time.
Saute onions, (celery & red pepper) till starting to brown (I do in a
wok). Add eggplant and garlic, stir well, add spices (not the salt),
stir again and on very low fire, saute. May drop some liquid, that's
all right, let it evaporate, and saute slowly until everything is
very tender. Keep checking, it's better if it browns a little, but
needs stirring so it doesn't burn. If it's too dry, add a few TBs
liquid at a time (I use vegetable broth, liquid from steaming
veggies, or liquid from microwaving mushrooms, etc. but water would
probably do). Add salt, tahini and lemon juice, pulse a few seconds
at a time in food processor or mash with potato masher -- can be
slightly lumpy, too smooth is pretty awful.Ã¿Add green stuff, pulse
once or twice to chop coarsely and distribute or chop coarsely and
stir in.
It's an ugly color, so I try to dress it up with a lemon slice,
greens and black olives, seems to help. Serve with quarters of pita
bread or mini pitas, it's finger food, a great appetizer with a curry
meal
