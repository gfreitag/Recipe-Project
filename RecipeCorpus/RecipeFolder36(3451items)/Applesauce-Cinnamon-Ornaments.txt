Title: Applesauce Cinnamon Ornaments
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
-cinnamon
-applesauce
Take one regular sized can of applesauce and add enough cinnamon to
make a dough.  Roll out and cut into shapes then bake in a VERY slow
oven say 150 to 250 until completely dry.  Let them air dry over
night before using. If you are going to use for hanging ornaments
punch a hole in the top with a straw(drinking kind). This recipe used
a lot of cinnamon so drain the applesause first then add the spice.
You can use any spice, apple pie or pumpkin pie spice are nice too.
So is a little nutmeg added to the cinnamon.
