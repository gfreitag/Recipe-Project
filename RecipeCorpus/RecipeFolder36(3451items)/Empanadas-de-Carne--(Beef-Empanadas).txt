Yield: 8 servings
SEALER AND GLAZE
1 ea Egg yolk
1 ea Egg white
1/2 c  Cold water
1 ts Coarse salt
1 ea Potato, diced 1/4"
1 c  Water
8 ea Scallions, whites only
1 tb Parsley
1 tb Cold water
DOUGH
3 c  All purpose flour
3 tb Vegetable shortening
1 ea Egg
FILLING
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 lb Ground lean beef
1/2 ts Ground cardamon
1 ea Bay leaf
1 ea Jalapeno pepper, seed, chop
Sift flour into a bowl, add lard and mix until the mixture makes a
coarse meal. Add egg, egg white and 1/4 cup of cold water. Continue
mixing and adding the water until a firm dough is formed. Knead until
the dough is smooth, then wrap and chill for 15-30 minutes.
In a small skillet, heat olive oil; add meat, cardamon, bay leaf,
pepper, and salt and saute over medium heat, stirring, until the
liquid has evaporated. Add potatoes and water and simmer over very
low heat, stirring now and then, until potatoes are tender and liquid
has evaporated. Add the scallions and cook 2-3 minutes longer. Remove
from heat, stir in parsley. Set filling aside and let cool, or
refigerate overnight, well covered. Make sealer and glaze by mixing
egg yolk and cold water together. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 deg F. On a floured board, roll out dough 1/8"
thick and cut 4" squares. Knead scraps and reroll, repeat making
squares until all the dough is used. Put one tablespoon of the
filling into the center of each square, moisten edges of the dough
with sealer, and fold to form a triangle. Press edges together with a
fork to seal. Place empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment
paper. Brush with remaining glaze and bake for 25 minutes, or until
golden. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly, serve warm.
Variation: Fried Empanadas -
Heat 6 cups of oil to 375 deg F, gently drop in empanadas and cook
until golden.
