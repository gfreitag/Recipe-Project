Title: New Orleans Thanksgiving (Part 3)
Categories: Cajun/creol, Holiday
Yield: 24 servings
That's what I said.
Ooh, la Leidenheimer's,
That's French for "bread.'"
Bread
~~~~~
"Ooh, la Leidenheimer's,
That about sums up the bread situation, unless you prefer bread from
"That wonderfully stubborn Reising family."
Dessert
~~~~~~~
It's pie.  The traditional dessert here is pecan pie, although some
transplanted
Yankees may choose pumpkin pie.  Those who find pecan pie too sweet
may opt for a lemon meringue or chocolate whip-top.
Coffee
~~~~~~
With chicory, of course.
The Recipes
~~~~~~~~~~~
Hot Crab Spread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 tablespoon milk
1 (8oz) package cream cheese at room temp.
1 (8oz) can flaked crab meat
2 tablespoons minced green onion
1/2 teaspoon horseradish
1/4 teaspoon salt
X pepper to taste
X dash of Tabasco
1/3 cup sliced almonds, toasted
X Crackers
In a bowl blend together the milk and cream cheese.  Mix in the next
six ingredients.  Transfer the mixture to an ovenproof dish and
sprinkle the top with the almonds.  Bake the dish at 350F until the
mixture bubbles.  Serve the spread with crackers.  Makes one pint.
Cold Shrimp Spread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 (8oz) package cream cheese at room temp.
1 lemon, juiced
2 pounds boiled shrimp, peeled, deveined, and coarsely ground
10 green onions, minced
1 cup mayonnaise
X salt and pepper to taste
X Worcestershire sauce to taste
X Tabasco to taste
X Zatarain's liquid crab boil to taste (see note!)
In a bowl, soften the cream cheese with the lemon juice.  Add the
shrimp, green onion, and mayonnaise.  Season the mixture with the
remaining ingredients and mix well.  Refrigerate the dip for 2
hours.
NOTE: Adding liquid crab boil to this dish gives it a unique and
spicy flavor, but be very careful and don't add more than a
couple of drops. Liquid crab boil is very concentrated and
extremely spicy!
Artichoke Balls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2-3 cloves garlic, mashed
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 (14oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and mashed
2 eggs, well beaten
1 1/2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
1 cup Parmesan or Romano cheese
X salt and pepper to taste
In a skillet saute the garlic in the olive oil.  Add the artichoke
hearts and simmer for 2 minutes.  Fold in the eggs and simmer for 2
minutes.  Add the bread crumbs and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove the
mixture from the heat, add the cheese, mix well, and cool.  When the
mixture is cool, form it into bite-size balls.  Roll the balls in
the bread crumbs and bake them at 350F for 10 minutes.  Makes 24.
