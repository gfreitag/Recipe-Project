Grind the garlic, chili, cumin seed, mustard seeds, peppercorns &
tumeric together in a processor with 2 Tbsp of vinegar to act as a
lubricant.
Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion paste over moderately low
heat until light brown. Add the ground spices and continue to fry the
mixture until it turns reddish, with a 'crumbled' look.
Add the prawns & cook, stirring frequently for 10 minutes. Add the
balance of the vinegar, the water and salt and continue to simmer,
uncovered, for 5 minutes more. There will be very little sauce. Serve
warm

VARIATION: The prawn vindaloo can be prepared as a proper pickle,
which means that it is a bottled (or refrigerated condiment) used now
and then with other foods as an adjunct to the meat or fish dishes
being served. Should you wish to prepare this as a pickle, follow the
instructions, but omit the onions & and the water & cook the prawns
separately in 2 Tbsp of oil before adding them to the mixture.
