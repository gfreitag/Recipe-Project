Categories: Cheese/eggs, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1    Sheet puff pastry
- cut into twelve 2" circles
1 tb Butter; melted
2/3 c  Walnuts, finely ground
12 lg Walnuts, whole; for garnish
1/4 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Port wine
1/4 lb Stilton cheese
1/4 c  Butter; softened
1/2 c  Heavy cream
Place the raisins in the port wine and marinate them for 1/2 hour.
Drain the raisins and gently pat them dry with paper towels.

Place the Stilton cheese in a food processor and blend it.  Add the
softened butter and blend it in.  Add the heavy cream and blend it in
until the mixture is very smooth.  Remove the mixture from the food
processor and place it in a bowl.  Add the marinated raisins and mix
them in well.

Preheat the oven to 350Ã¸F.  Place the puff pastry circles on a greased
sheet pan.  Prick them with a fork.  Place another baking sheet on
top of the pastry.  Bake them for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are
golden brown.

On each of 4 small plates place 1 circle of the puff pastry.  In this
order, place 3 tablespoons of the cheese mixture, one pastry round, 3
tablespoons of the cheese mixture, and one pastry round.  Brush the
top with the melted butter.  Evenly sprinkle on the ground walnuts.

Place the stacked pastry in the refrigerator for 10 minutes so that
they chill.

Heat the remaining whole walnuts in the oven for 1 minute and place
them around the mille-feuilles.
