Title: Similiar To Pork Au'lait
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
See below
My grandmother (born in West Texas during the Depression) makes
something very similar.  I've never considered it particularly fancy.
But it's mighty good.  She lightly flours, then browns pork chops,
puts them in a baking dish, covers them with milk and bakes them.
The milk gets nice and thick.  And the pork is melt in your
mouth tender.
She generally serves hers with mashed potatoes.  With the milk as a
gravy.
