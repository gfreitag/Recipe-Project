Title: Fresh Morels in Caraway Sauce
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
Thinly sliced
Salt
3 tb Caraway seed
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Milk
1 lg Russet potato, peeled
4 oz Fresh morels
2 tb Butter
1    Red bell pepper, seeded
Thinly sliced
1/2 sm Onion(s)
Cut the potato in cubes, place in a small saucepan, and cover with
lightly salted water.  Bring to a boil and simmer until fully cooked,
about 20 min.

While the potato is cooking, clean the morels and slice them in half.
Place the butter in a saute pan over medium heat, and saute the red
pepper and onion. Add the morels and continue to saute until they are
limp and fully cooked, about 5 min. Season with a little salt.

Place the caraway seed in a small saucepan and just cover with water.
Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer for 30 min,
adding water as needed to keep the seed just covered. Strain the
liquid into a small bowl and discard the seed.

Drain the potato and begin to process in a food processor. Add the
caraway liquid, cream, and milk and puree until smooth and creamy,
adding extra milk if needed. Add salt to taste.

Divide the potato puree among 4 plates and place the morels in the
center. Serve immediately.
