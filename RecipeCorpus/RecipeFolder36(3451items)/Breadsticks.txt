Title: Breadsticks
Categories: Breads
Yield: 3 servings
3/4 c  Warm water
1/2 ts Salt
2 1/4 c  All purpose flour
1 1/2 tb Sesame seed(optional)
1 x  Pkg active dry yeast
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Butter
1 1/2 ts Cornmeal
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add sugar, salt,
butter and 1 cup flour. Beat with electric mixer until smooth.
Gradually add remaining flour until dough is easy to handle; stir
with a wooden spoon.
Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic-
about ten minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat all
sides. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk- about 1 to 1-1/4
hours. Punch dough down and divide into three equal parts. Shape each
into a long, narrow roll about 14 inches long by 3/4 inch in diameter.
Lightly butter the inside of a breadstick(or baguette) pan.
Sprinkle with cornmeal and shake off the excess. Brush tops of loaves
with cold water. Sprinkle with sesame seed. Do not cover. Let rise in
a warm place until doubled- about 45 minutes. Bake in a preheated 375
degree oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan,
place on wire rack to cool. Makes 3 large bread sticks.
