In a separate container cut carrots into thin rounds.

Peel onions and cut into small pieces.

In a medium-sized pan saute the onion with butter or margarine.  When
onions feel soft, add mustard seeds.  30 seconds after that add cumin
powder, coriander powder, and turmeric powder.  Mix the spices.

Drop carrots in pan and saute.  Put the lid on for 5 minutes.  Now add
cabbage.  Mix all the vegetables together.  Add cinnamon powder,
salt, and chili powder.  Put the lid on.  Wait for 5 minutes.

Turn over mixture in pan.  Make sure the spices don't stick to the

minutes. If you want curry to be softer, keep the lid on longer after
cooking.
