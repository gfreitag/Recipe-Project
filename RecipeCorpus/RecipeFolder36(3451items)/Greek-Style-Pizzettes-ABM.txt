Categories: Italian, Main dish, Breads, Kooknet
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Salt
2 3/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1 c  Water
1 ts Honey
1/2 ts Lemon Rind; grated
1/4 ts Pepper
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2 tb Parsley; chopped
Salt
Pepper
3 tb Olive Oil
1/4    Unsalted Butter
1/4 lb Spinach leaves; rinsed and
-dried
14    Kalamata Olives; pitted
1/2 c  Feta Cheese; crumbled
Place all dough ingredients in machine and program for knead and first
rise. Press start. After the first 5 minutes of kneading the dough
will be firm and pull away from the sides of the machine.  While the
dough is rising you can prepare the toppings. In a saute pan, heat
the butter over low heat and cook the spinach long enough for it to
wilt, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
garlic. Set the mixture aside while you assemble the pizzettes.

Preheat the oven to 425Ã¸F. with the rack in the center position.
Lightly flour 2 baking sheets and set them aside. When the dough is
completed, transfer to a lightly floured surface, cover it with a
clean towel and let it rest for 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 4
even pieces and roll each piece out to a 6" circle. Transfer the
circles to the prepared baking sheet. Distribute the spinach over the
circles followed by the olives and feta cheese. Sprinkle on the
chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil
over the top of each. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the crust is deep
golden brown and the top is starting to brown.
