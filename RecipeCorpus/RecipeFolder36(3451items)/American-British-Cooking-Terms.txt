Butter:
Some confusion may arise over the measuring of butter and other hard
fats. In the United States butter is generally sold in one-pound
packages that contain four equal "sticks". The wrapper on each stick
is marked to show tablespoons so the cook can cut the stick according
to the quantity required. The equivalent weights are:
= 115 g   (4 oz)
:    1 stick
:    1 tablespoon   =  15 g   ( 1/2 oz)

Flour:
American all-purpose flour is milled from a mixture of hard and soft
wheats, whereas British plain flour is made mainly from soft wheat. To
achieve a near equivalent to American all-purpose flour, use half
British plain flour and half strong bread flour.

Sugar:
When sugar is called for it is assumed to be granulated, unless
otherwise specified. American granulated sugar is finer than British
granulated, closer to caster sugar, so British cooks should use
caster sugar.
