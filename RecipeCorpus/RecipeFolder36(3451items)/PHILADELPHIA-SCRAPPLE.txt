Title: PHILADELPHIA SCRAPPLE
Categories: Meats, Breakfast
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Sage or poultry seasoning
1/8 ts Mace
1 c  Fine cornmeal
1/2 c  Buckwheat flour
2 lb Lean bony pork
2 qt Water
1 tb Salt
Pepper to taste
Buckwheat flour is the secret of the fine flavor, plus slow browning.

Put meat in kettle, add 1 1/2 qts. water, salt and pepper.  Simmer
until meat is very tender.  Skim fat from top, strain off broth and
set aside.

Remove meat from bones and chop it fine (do not grind).  Pour broth
into sauce pan, add meat, sage and mace and bring to boil.

Combine cornmeal and buckwheat.  Slowly stir 2 c. cold water into
mixture. Add a little at a time to meat, keeping it simmering
continuously. Stir until mixture reaches the consistency of soft
mush. Lower heat so scrapple will not scorch (or cook over boiling
water for 1 hour), stirring occasionally.

Pour into two 9 X 5 X 3" pans, rinsed with cold water.  Chill.

To cook, turn scrapple out of pan and cut into 1/4" or 1/2" slices.
Lay them so slices do not touch, in a cold, heavy skillet.  Set over
moderate heat, let brown slowly, but thoroughly on one side.  Repeat
for other side. It may take about 30 minutes to brown scrapple
properly.

For extra flavor - add 2 slices pork liver, chopped, with pork.
