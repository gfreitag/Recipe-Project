Title: Pine Nut Macaroons
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 48 servings
4 lg Egg Whites
3/4 c  Pine Nuts
1/2 c  Confectioner's Sugar
1 lb Almond Paste
1 c  Granulated Sugar
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1. Preheat the oven to 300 F. Line baking sheets with parchment or
waxed paper.
2. Using an electric mixer, cream together the almond paste and
granulated sugar in a mixing bowl until smooth. Beat in the vanilla.
Gradually beat in the egg whites to make a smooth and somewhat fluffy
mixture. 3. Drop the batter by the heaping teaspoonful 1 inch apart
on the prepared baking sheets. By hand, stud each cookie generously
with pine nuts, then liberally sift the confectioners' sugar over the
tops. 4. Bake the macaroons until light golden brown, 18 to 20 mins.
Let cool slightly, then transfer with a metal spatula to a wire rack
to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 1 week.
Makes 4 to 4 1/2 dozen cookies.
