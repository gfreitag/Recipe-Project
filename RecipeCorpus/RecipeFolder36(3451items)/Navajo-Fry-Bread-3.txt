Title: Navajo Fry Bread 3
Categories: Breads, Amerindian
Yield: 8 fry breads
1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Vegetable shortening
4 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Double-acting baking powder
1 ts Salt
In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt,
stir in the water, and knead the mixture on a floured surface until
it forms a soft but not sticky dough. Let the dough stand, covered
with a kitchen towel, for 15 minutes. Pull off egg-size pieces of the
dough and oat and stretch them into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Poke a
hole witha finger through the center of each round so that the breads
will fry evenly. In a large heavy skillet heat the shortening over
moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the
rounds, 1 at a time, for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are
golden, and transfer the breads as they are fried to paper towels to
drain. Source: Gourmet Magazine April 1993 Pg. 193-194
