Title: TOFFEE APPLES AND BANANAS
Categories: Fruit, Chinese, Desserts, Guestchefs
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Sesame oil
1 1/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
2 ts Sesame oil
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb White sesame seeds, toasted
2 lg Firm apples
2    Firm bananas
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1 lg Egg
PEEL AND CORE THE APPLES and cut each into 8 large wedges. Peel the
bananas and cut them into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Combine the flour,
cornstarch, egg and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a small bowl. Mix
them well to form a smooth, very thick batter. Combine the peanut oil
and 2 teaspoons of sesame oil in a deep fat fryer or wok and heat the
mixture until it is moderately hot. Put the fruit into the batter
mixture. Then lift out several pieces of fruit at a time, using a
slotted spoon, and drain off any excess batter. Deep-fry for about 2
minutes, until they are golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain
on paper towels. Repeat the process until you have deep-fried all the
fruit. Just before serving, prepare a bowl of ice water filled with
ice cubes. Reheat the oil over moderate heat and deep-fry the fruit a
second time for about 2 minutes. Drain again on paper towels. Put the
sugar, sesame seeds and 2 tablespoons of oil from the deep-frying oil
into a pot. Heat the mixture until the sugar melts and begins to
caramelize. (Watch the heat to prevent it from burning.) When the
caramel is light brown, add the fruit sections. Stir them gently in
the caramel syrup to coat them. Then take them out and put them into
the ice water to harden. Do a few at a time to prevent them from
sticking together. Remove them from the water and place on a serving
platter. Serve at once.
