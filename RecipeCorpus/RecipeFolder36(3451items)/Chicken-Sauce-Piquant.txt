MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
1 ts Finely chopped jalapeno
-pepper (fresh!  Remove
Seeds and membrane)
1 tb Minced garlic
1 ts Tabasco sauce
2 c  Chicken broth
2 c  Hot cooked rice
1 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Chopped green bell pepper
1 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Peeled and chopped tomatoes
-(or substitute medium
-can)
1 c  Canned tomato sauce
Serves four. Total time approximately 1 1/2 hours, including chopping
vegetables.

In plastic bag, mix 1 tablespoon of seasoning mix into flour. Remove
excess fat from the chicken and rub remaining seasoning mix into
chicken pieces. Shake chicken in flour until well coated. Save the
flour to thicken the sauce later. In large skillet, heat 1/2 inch oil
to 350 degree. Fry chicken (skin side down first) until browned and
crispy on both sides and the meat is cooked, about 5 to 8 minutes per
side.  Do not crowd. Don't let drippings burn.  Drain chicken on
paper towels. Pour out the hot oil into Pyrex glass or metal
container, leaving as much sediment in the pan as possible. Place the
chicken pieces and chicken broth into a large pot or saucepan and
bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, return 1/4 cup of oil to pan.  Turn heat to high. Using
spoon or wooden spatula, loosen any particles stuck to pan bottom.
Then add the celery, bell peppers, and onion. Cook until sediment is
well mixed into vegetables, stirring constantly and scrapping pan
bottom well. Do not burn. Lower heat, then add tomatoes, jalapeno
peppers and garlic. Stir well and cook for about 2 minutes.  Add the
tomato sauce and cook about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir
in the Tabasco sauce and remove from heat.

Then stir half the tomato mixture into the chicken and stock, cover
and simmer over low heat for 5 more minutes.  Stir in the remaining
tomato mixture and simmer covered for 10 minutes more, stirring
occasionally. Remove from heat and serve over rice.
