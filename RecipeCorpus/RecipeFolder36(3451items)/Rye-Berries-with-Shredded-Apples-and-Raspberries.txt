Title: Rye Berries with Shredded Apples and Raspberries
Categories: Nuts/grains, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Crushed pink peppercorns
1    Granny Smith apple, peeled
Cored, shredded or grated
1 pt Raspberries
1 c  Whole rye berries
3 1/2 c  Water
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Champagne vinegar
Or apple cider vinegar
Spread the rye out on a work surface and pick over it. Place in a fine
sieve and rinse under cold running water for 2 min.

Place the rye and water in a heavy, medium saucepan and bring to a
rolling boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 hour or
until the grains are tender but retain their crunch. Remove the pan
from the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 min. Pour the grains into
a mixing bowl and let cool, about 5 min, then add the sugar, vinegar,
and peppercorns. Fold in the shredded apple, mixing well, then
immediately before serving add the raspberries.

Note: This dish goes well with grilled fish or poultry.
