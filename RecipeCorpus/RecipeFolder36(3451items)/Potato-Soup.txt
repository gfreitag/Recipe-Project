Title: Potato soup
Categories: Vegetables, Soup/stew, Potatoes
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Butter
3 tb All purpose flour
1 c  Cream, heavy whipping
1 tb Tarragon, dried
1/2 ts Thyme, dried
4 md Russet potatoes, 1/2" cubes
3    Celery, finely diced
2 md Carrots, shredded
6 c  Vegetable broth or chicken
Stock
1 md Onion, finely chopped
In a large skillet on medium high heat add a little olive oil and
saute the onions for about 2 minutes. Then add the carrots and
celery. Continue saute for another 5 minutes until onions are soft
and translucent. Add stock. potatoes, tarragon and thyme. Add salt &
pepper to taste. Lower heat to medium and cook covered until potatoes
are done ( about 20 minutes).
In a separate pan make a roux out of the butter and flour. Add some
stock as necessary to blend smooth.
When potatoes are done stir in the roux. Next stir in the heavy cream.
Continue cooking on medium for 5 minutes to warm and blend. Serve
with a garnish of fresh tarragon or parsley on top

Options & Notes: If you use fresh tarragon use 2 tbs. You can also add
some minced garlic when the onions are done if you like the taste.
You can also saute the vegetables to the point of caramelizing and
use thyme instead of tarragon. Puree about a cup of the soup (be sure
to get mostly the potatoes) and return to the soup for thickening
instead of making a roux.
