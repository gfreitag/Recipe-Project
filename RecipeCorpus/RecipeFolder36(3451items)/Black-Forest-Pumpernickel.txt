This is a dark bread with that fabulous, distinctive rye flavor. Pair
this soul-satisfying bread with thin slices of ham and cheese or a
mug of homemade potato soup.

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select a light crust setting, and
press "start".

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.
