With the optional eel this is known as Aalsuppe. Although the jam
sounds weird the author swears it is both necessary and good. The
recipe is from the chef of the Weinhaus Dolles, an old Hamburg
restaurant, long since gone.

Soak prunes and apricots in warm water to cover for 2 hrs. Put ham
bone and rind in 3 qts cold water, bring to a boil and simmer 1 1/2
hrs. Remove rind and discard; cut meat from the bone in small cubes.
Cool stock and skim fat. Clean and dice the pot vegetables. Heat 3
tbs butter in a skillet and saute vegetables until they soften. Add
vegetables to the ham stock. Heat 4 tbs butter and fry onion until it
is deep brown. Sprinkle flour over this and blend stirring over a low
heat until browned. Do not let the roux scorch. Add this plus the
herbs to the stock and simmer 15 min.

While stock is simmering, bring the white wine to the boiling point
with the bay leaf and peppercorns. Add eel, simmer 10 minutes and set
aside. Add the reserved diced ham, the soaked fruits, vinegar, jam
and wine that the eel was cooked in to the stock. Simmer 5 minutes;
adjust the seasoning. The soup should have a winey sweet and sour
balance. add the peas in the last 5 min. To serve place some eel in
each bowl and ladle the soup over it making sure each dish gets a
prune and an apricot. From: The German Cookbook by Mimi Sheraton,
