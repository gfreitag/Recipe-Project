Title: Chilean Hamburg Casserole
Categories: Casseroles, Main dish, Meats, So. america
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Fresh corn
1/2 c  Tomatoes; chopped
10    Black olives; cut in half
1/2 ts Oregano
More black pepper to taste
1 1/2 c  Hot mashed potatoes
1 ts Paprika
1 1/2 lb Coarsely ground lean beef
1 c  Onion; chopped
1    Dried chile pod; crushed
1/4 c  Raisins
1 ts Brown sugar
1 ts Cumin
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
The combination of beef with sugar and raisins may sound a little
weird, as well as the olives in the corn mixture but this is a
really tasty dish... the flavors DO blend together nicely.

In a heavy skillet, brown the meat. Add the onion and chile; saute
with the meat until the onion is limp and translucent. Stir in
the raisins, brown sugar, cumin, salt and pepper. Heat thoroughly
and set aside.

In a saucepan combine the corn and tomatoes with a little water.
Bring to a boil and simmer 5 min. Add olives, oregano and perhaps
some more pepper; simmer another 2 minutes.

Assemble a casserole with a bottom layer of the ground beef mixture;
then the corn mixture and top with a layer of mashed potatoes. Pat
the potato layer down and smooth it. Sprinkle on the paprika and
bake in a 350 degree F oven for 25 min or until the top has browned
a bit.

An original recipe by Jim Weller based vaguely on a long ago meal
in a Chilean restaurant. The original proper name of the dish is
long forgotten.
