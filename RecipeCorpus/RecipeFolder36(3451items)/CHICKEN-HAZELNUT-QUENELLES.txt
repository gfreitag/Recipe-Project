Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Hazelnuts; skins removed,
- and chopped
2 c  Chicken stock
2    Chicken breasts; skin and
- bones removed
Salt and pepper
2    Eggs
1 tb Butter; softened
In a food processor place the chicken breasts, salt, and pepper.
Pure them until a smooth consistency is achieved.  Add the eggs one
at a time and blend them in well.  Add the butter and blend it in.
With the food processor still running, slowly add the heavy cream so
that it is mixed in well.

In a medium bowl place the pured chicken mixture.  Add the hazelnuts
and mix them in.  Place the mousse in the refrigerator so that it
chills.

Remove the chilled mousse and, using 2 spoons, form it into 12
egg-shaped quenelles.

Place the chicken stock in a medium saucepan and heat it on medium
high until it almost reaches a boil.  Place the quenelles in the
stock and cook them for 3 minutes.  Turn them once during the cooking
process.
