Title: CORN WITH BARBECUE SAUCE
Categories: Appetizers, Snacks, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Malt vinegar
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/4 pt Vegetable stock
1 ts Muscovado sugar
1/4 ts Salt
4 md Corn on the cob
2 tb Dry sherry
2 oz Onion, chopped
1 ea Garlic clove, minced
8 oz Tomatoes, skinned & chopped
4 oz Green bell pepper, diced
1 oz Green chilies, diced
1/2 oz Ginger, grated
1 oz Vegetable oil
1 tb Tomato paste
Heat oil.  Add the onion & garlic & fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in
the tomato, bell pepper, chili, ginger, tomato paste, malt vinegar,
Worcestershire sauce, stock, sugar & salt.  Bring to a boil, cover &
simmer for 30 minutes, removing the lid for the last 10 minutes of
cooking.  Cool slightly & then puree by forcing through a sieve.

Slice stalks from the corn cobs.  Remove the leaves & the silk
threads. Place in a pan of boiling, salted water & simmer, covered,
for 20 minutes, or until tender (Mark's note: this seems too long for
cooking corn, but the British do like overcooking vegetables!) Drain.

Meanwhile, return the sauce to the pan, bring back to a boil, add
sherry & simmer for a couple of minutes.  Pour over cobs & serve.
