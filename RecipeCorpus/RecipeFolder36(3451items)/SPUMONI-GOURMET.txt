Title: SPUMONI GOURMET
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Chopped marachino cherries
1 tb Shredded candied orange peel
1 tb Slivered blanched almonds
5    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Sugar
2 c  Milk
1    Piece vanilla bean
1 c  Heavy cream
In a saucepan beat 5 egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar until the mixture is
thick and pale in color.  Stir in 2 cups milk, add a 1-inch piece of
vanilla bean, and cook over very low heat, stirring constantly, until
the custard is thick.  Be careful not to let it boil.  Discard the
vanilla bean and cool the custard.  Turn it into a refrigerator tray
and freeze it for about 2 hours, or until it is firm, but soft enough
to be molded easily.

Whip 1 cup heavy cream until it is stiff, fold in 1/4 cup sugar and 1
tablespoon each of chopped marachino cherries, shredded candied orange
peel, and slivered blanched almonds and chill the mixture.

Chill a 1-quart jelly or spumoni mold and line the inside of the mold
with the frozen custard.  Fill the center of the mold with the
chilled whipped cream mixture, cover the top of the mold with wax
paper, and freeze the spumoni without stirring.
