Melt butter.  Shape dough into a disc.  Cut horizontally almost all
the way through, leaving about 1/4" uncut along one side.  Open,
brush with half the butter and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
Close and press edges together.  Roll into a 10" circle.  Put on a
baking sheet, cover and let rise about 30 minutes.  Use scissors to
cut holes for a mouth and eyes. Push foil into holes to keep them
open.  Cut deep gashes into top of head for spiky hair.  Press
raisins into dough to make eyebrows.  Brush with remaining butter.
Bake until bread sounds hollow when tapped, about 40 minutes.  Remove
foil and continue baking until lightly browned, about 5 mnutes.
Decorate with candy while bread is still warm. Work time: 30 minutes
Total time: 1 hour, 45 minutes
