Title: Stuffed Jalapenos
Categories: Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 batch  Get a quantity of fresh jalapenos (whole canned will work, too, just
won't taste quite the same.)

Cut slits in the side of the peppers, and scoop out the seeds and
veins, leaving the peppers whole.  Note:  if you're doing this in
quantity, wear rubber gloves, the oil in the peppers is strong enough
to cause serious burns.  For smaller quantitites, coat your hands
liberally with cooking oil if you have sensitive skin.

Stuff with a mixture of half grated sharp cheddar cheese and half
cream cheese (if you like, you can add ground cooked shrimp, crab or
lobster meat to this -- if so, allow about 1/3 seafood to the total
quantity of cheese used.)

Stuff the cheese mixture into the inside of the peppers, and roll the
filled peppers first in flour, then in an eggwash (1 egg beaten with 2
Tbsp. of cold water), then in a mixture of 1/3 cornmeal and 2/3 flour.

Allow the coated peppers to dry (re-bread if you want a reallty crispy
coating), and fry in deep fat until brown.  Serve immediately.

For a cold version of this, use whole pickled peppers, cut in half,
and seeded.  Simply pile the cheese or cheese/seafood mixture into
the peppers, sprinkle with a little paprika for garnish, and serve.
