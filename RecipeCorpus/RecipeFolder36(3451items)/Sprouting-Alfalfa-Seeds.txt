Title: Sprouting Alfalfa Seeds
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 tb Alfalfa seeds
Water to 3 times seeds
1 ea Quart jar -OR-
1 ea Prepared tray
Use about 2-1/2 tablespoons seeds in a quart jar, or sprout on trays.

This will yield about 1 quart of sprouts. The yield will be 1-1/2
cups for each 1/4 cup sprouted, and the sprouts will be very short;
only about 1/8 inch long.

Soak for 8 hours. Rinse 2 to 3 times daily for 4 to 6 days.

Move into sunlight to green, then harvest when sprouts are 1-1/2 to 2
inches long. Use in salads, sandwiches, omelets, or as garnish. To
use in baked goods, harvest sprouts after just 2 days.
