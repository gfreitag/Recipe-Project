1/2 c  Leftover cooked chicken
- cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1/2 c  Fresh or frozen peas

3 c  Cooked long-grain rice,

3 tb Peanut or vegetable oil

1 ts Shrimp paste, or more (opt.)
1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Oyster sauce
2 lg Eggs; lightly beaten with
1    Egg yolk
BREAK UP CLUMPS OF RICE by gently rubbing between the palms of your
hands into a large bowl. Over medium- high heat, preheat wok until
hot. Add oil; tilt wok to coat sides. When oil is moderately hot, add
salt and the optional shrimp paste, stir until fragrant or for 5
seconds. Immediately add rice and quickly stir-fry, pressing and
poking at clumps of rice until all grains are separated, without
browning rice (about 3 minutes). Season with sugar, soy sauce and
oyster sauce. Stir-fry until each grain is evenly coated (about 1
minute). Push rice to sides of wok. Add beaten egg mixture to center
of wok, and allow to cook, lightly beating eggs in center only (about
1 minute). Toss together with rice. (Small flecks of egg will appear
interspersed in the rice.) Add shrimp, barbecued pork, chicken, peas,
lettuce, and green onions; toss and stir until mixed and heated
through and lettuce is wilted (about 2 minutes).
