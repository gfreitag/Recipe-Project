Yield: 2 servings

2 c  Ice cubes (about 11)
1 pt Strawberries, fresh, trimmed
1/4 c  Sugar
Put a 9 or 10-inch metal cake pan in the freezer.  In a blender,
blend the strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice until the mixture is
smooth and the sugar is dissolved.  Add the ice cubes, blend the
mixture until it is smooth, and pour it into the cold pan.

the edge, but still soft in the center.  Stir the strawberry ice,
mashing the frozen parts with a fork, and spoon it into 2 bowls.
