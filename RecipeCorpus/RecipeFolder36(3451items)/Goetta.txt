I make goetta I just go by taste. That's the way my Mother made it
(German descent). So I thought I'd better look
the recipe up in J of C to give proportions. If I remember correctly
your recipe was simular.
2 lbs pork neck bones (I use a pork shoulder and increase all
ingredients) 1 1/2 quarts boiling water
6 peppercorns
1 small bay leaf
1 cup oatmeal
salt
1 tsp. or more diced onion (I use at least 1 whole onion)
cayenne
1 tsp. allspice or more to taste (This is my addition)
Cook meat in water with peppercorns and bay leaf until meat falls away
from bone. (I prefer to put the pot in refrigerator all night and skim
off fat in the morning). Grind meat. Cook oatmeal in liquid with rest
of ingredients and ground pork (You may have to add more water). Cook
to consistency of mush.
Pour into loaf pans which have been rinsed in cold water. When ready
to serve, remove from pan, slice and fry in a little melted butter or
drippings until brown. Good for breakfast served with toast.
Since I make a large batch, I remove the goetta from the pans when
they are firm enough to hold their shape, wrap in plastic and freeze.
How does this compare to your recipe? J of C says that if you use
corn meal you call if scrapple. If you use oats you call it goetta.
