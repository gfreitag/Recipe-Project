Categories: Cake/cookie, Penndutch
Yield: 40 servings
Makes 40 cookies
CRUMB TOPPING
3/4 cup (1-1/2 sticks) butter
of that can be lard) at
1 cup brown sugar
1-1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
Pastry for a 2 crust 9 inch pie
1/4 cup moslasses
(1/4 1/4 cup light corn syrup
room temp. Pinch of Salt
1 tsp. baking soda
1 cup boiling water
1/2 tsp. grated nutmeg
Line a 2 quart rectangular glass baking dish with pastry, crimping
the dough well at the top and over the sides++you do not want it to
slip during baking.  With a food processor or mixer, combine the crumb
ingredients; reserve.
Preheat the oven to 325 F.  In a medium bowl, combine the molasses,
corn syrup, salt, baking soda, and boiling water.  Pour 1/2 cup of the
liquid into the pie shell and sprinkle with one-third of the crumb
mixture.  Repeat twice, ending with crumbs.  Bake for 35 to 40
minutes. Watch carefully in the beginning, and if crust begins to
slip down, pat it back up with a knife.  The top will be golden.  Let
cool and cut into 1-1/2 inch squares.
NOTE: If you really like molasses, use less corn syrup and increase
the moslasses.
