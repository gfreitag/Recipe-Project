-Jo Ferry jynx23a
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Salt
*1/2 to 3/4 cup, enough to make the consistancy of a thick gravy. Mix
the food coloring into the water and then add the salt and flour. Mix
well. Note: I bought the Tupperware small snack cups (the ones in
red, blue, yellow and green) and then matched the colors. It makes a
great gift and easy to find the color.
