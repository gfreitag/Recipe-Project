Ingredients:

1 jar    (275 g) seedless maraschino cherries 2 tblsp Cherry marnier
1 tub (2 litres) vanilla ice cream 100 g packet (3 1/2 oz) round white
marshmallows 1 violet crumble bar, chopped (whot? not crumbled?) 200
g (7 oz) Vienna almonds, finely chopped 1 cherry ripe, chopped Drain
the cherries and reserve the liquid.  Put cherries into a small bowl
and add cherry marnier (don't be tempted to add too much liqueur as
it will stop the ice cream from freezing).  Soak overnight.  Next
day, remove the ice cream from the freezer to soften.  Cut
marshmallows into quarters and add to the cherries.  Transfer the ice
cream into a large mixing bowl. Stir through all the remaining
ingredients plus sufficeint reserved cherry liquid to colour the ice
cream a pretty pale pink (add a few drops of pink colour if
necessary). Put the mixture into a lamington tin and freeze until
firm.  Cover with two thicknesses of foil and store in freezer until
Christmas day.  Cut into squares. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
