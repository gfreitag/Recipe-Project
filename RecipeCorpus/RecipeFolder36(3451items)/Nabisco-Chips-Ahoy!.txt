Title: Nabisco Chips Ahoy!
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 servings
1 ts Baking soda
4 c  Flour
1/4 c  Water
12 oz Miniature chocolate chips
1 1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
Preheat the oven to 325.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the
shortening and sugars and blend with an electric mixer until smooth.
Add the salt, vanilla and baking soda.  While beating at low speed,
slowly add the flour.  Then add the water.  Mix thoroughly.  Stir in
the chocolate chips. Form the cookies by breaking off bits of dough
and patting them out with your fingers into 2" rounds about 1/4"
thick.  Place the cookies on ungreased cookie sheets and bake for
15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown on the top and around the
edges.
