Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Crushed dried mint
1 tb Chopped garlic
1 1/2 c  Long grain rice
Salt to taste
Louisiana hot sauce or
Grnd cayenne pepper to taste
Stock or water
2 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 lb Pork (1" cubes)
1 c  Chopped onion
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 c  Finely chopped bell pepper
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Over medium-high heat in a large saucepan, heat the oil, brown off
the pork, then remove from the pot. Add the onions, green onions,
parsley, and bell pepper, and cook until the onions are brown.
Stirring, add the wine, mint, garlic, rice, meat, salt, hot sauce,

cooking on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Bring the stock
to a boil and let boil until it has disappeared from the top, stir
again, then lower heat. Cover the pot and simmer for at least 1 hour
before lifting the lid. Then check the rice for doneness, stir,
cover, and let steam another 15 to 20 minutes.

"A jambalaya is a meal that we like cooking outside as well as
inside. When we cook it outside, it's usually done in a forty-quart
pot. All the family and friends come over, and we pass a good time.
This is a popular dish served at all social gatherings in southern
Louisiana."-Justin Wilson
