Categories: Guestchefs, Chinese, Pasta/rice, Meats
Yield: 1 batch
3 tb Brown bean paste
1 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Water
12 oz Chinese egg noodles
8 oz Bean sprouts
4    Scallions, minced
1 lb Ground beef
3 cl Garlic, minced
2 tb Rice wine
2 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
2    Scallions, minced
3 tb Hoisin sauce
Brown ground beef in its own fat (or use a little oil) along with the
garlic. When it's gone gray, add rice wine, fish sauce, and
scallions. Cook a minute, then add hoisin, bean paste, and cornstarch
mixed with water. Cook a minute or two until cornstarch has thickened
and set aside.

Meanwhile, cook and drain the noodles as you would any other noodles.

Mound the noodles on a platter and arrange the bean sprouts over the
top. Pour the hot (or warm, at least) meat sauce over and strew with
scallions. Serve hot or cool.
