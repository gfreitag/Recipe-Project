Title: Wild Mushroom Bread Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 cups
Black pepper
1/2 c  (to 3/4 cup)
Fresh bread crumbs
2 tb Butter (opt but pref)
1/2 oz Dried porcini
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Sugar
1 ts Soy sauce
This sauce is goes well with quail, rabbit, and chicken

In a small saucepan, combine the mushrooms, salt, sugar, soy sauce,
and pepper. Add 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 min
over low heat. Strain the reconstituted mushrooms if you want a
smooth sauce. If not, leave the mushrooms in the liquid.

Gradually add the bread crumbs and begin to stir into the sauce. The
amount of crumbs that can be absorbed will depend on the type of
bread you use. Start by adding  1/2 cup and stir well. Add more
crumbs if necessary; you can always add a little water if the sauce
gets too thick. If you want a smooth sauce, puree it in a blender or
food processor, then add the mushrooms. Stir in the butter until it
melts. Serve immediately.
