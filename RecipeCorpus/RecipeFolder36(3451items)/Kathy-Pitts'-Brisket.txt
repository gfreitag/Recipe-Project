Title: Kathy Pitts' Brisket
Categories: Meats, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 brisket
And cut into fine slivers
3    The white part of 2-3
-green onions, cut into
-fine slivers
Lots of paprika, lemon
Pepper for a barbecue rub
3 lb Brisket, trimmed of
-almost all fat and
-silvery covering
3 tb Liquid smoke marinade
(we used Figaro's)
3 tb Worcestershire sauce
1    Serrano pepper, seeded
Marinate the brisket in a mixture of the liquid smoke and
Worcestershire sauce for 2-3 hours.  Remove from the marinade, and
cut slits all over the exterior of the meat.  Insert slivers of onion
and serrano pepper in the slits.

Cover the brisket with a VERY liberal coating of paprika and lemon
pepper. Wrap securely in heavy duty aluminum foil (use a drug-store
wrap to prevent leakage).

Place the brisket in an ovenproof rimmed dish (we used our trusty
cast iron skillet) and place in a preheated 250 degree (F) oven for
at least 16 hours.

After the first 12-14 hours, you may unwrap the brisket briefly, and
ladle out some of the accumulated juices for use in your own homemade
barbecue sauce.
