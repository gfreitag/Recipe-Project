This recipe can be served as a side dish, as a salad, or, with a
sprinkling of brown sugar on top, as a dessert.

Place the wheat berries in a fine sieve and rinse under cold running
water for 1 min.

Place in a mixing bowl with cold water, and soak for 8 hours or
overnight. Drain.

Place the drained wheat berries and 3 cup fresh water in a heavy,
medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat,
cover, and simmer until the wheat berries are tender but retain their
crunch, about 1 hour. Remove the pan from the heat and let sit,
covered, for 10 min. Drain the wheat berries and place in a mixing
bowl.

Place the vinegar and honey in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil
over high heat. Add the raspberries, stirring gently, and immediately
remove the pan from the heat.

Carefully combine the raspberries with the wheat berries. Place on
4 serving plates and serve warm with the lemon and yogurt.
