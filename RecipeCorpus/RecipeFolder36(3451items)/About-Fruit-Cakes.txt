Title: About Fruit Cakes
Categories: Information, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 text file  The best, rich fruit cakes are fundamentally butter cakes with just
enough batter to bind the fruit.  They improve with aging and if
saturated with liquors which will prevent molding and buried in
powdered sugar, can be kept for years in a tightly covered container
in a cool place.

Raisins, figs and dates are more easily cut if the scissors are
dipped in water periodically.

To easily remove cakes, line the pans with parchment paper or aluminum
foil before pouring in the batter. When the cakes are baked cool in
the pan on a rack for 20 minutes and then lift the cakes out of the
pan with the help of the paper or foil and continue to cool on a rack.

To decorate the cakes with either candied fruit or nut meats dip the
bottoms of the decorations in a light sugar syrup before applying or
coat the cake with a thin glaze of syrup and arrange the decorations
on the glazing.

To store wrap the cakes in brandy soaked linens or pour hot but not
boiling brandy over the cakes slowly drop by drop. Then wrap in foil
and place in a tightly covered tin. Store in a cool place and let age
at least several weeks to develop the best flavor.
