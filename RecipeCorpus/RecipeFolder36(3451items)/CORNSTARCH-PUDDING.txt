Title: CORNSTARCH PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salt
MMMMM-------------------FOR CHOCOLATE PUDDING------------------------
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
MMMMM---------------------FOR BANANA PUDDING--------------------------
2    Bananas, chopped
MMMMM------------------FOR BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING-----------------------
-1 T extra butter
Brown sugar instead of white
Blend sugar, flour and salt.  Gradually add milk, mixing well.  Cook
and stir until smooth, thickened and clear.  At this point, add any
ingredients necessary for variations.

Stir a little of the pudding into beaten egg, then return to pudding.
(If you heat the egg too quickly, it'll cook a little.  It's
unsightly, but it'll still taste pretty good.)

Add butter and vanilla, mix well, and chill in fridge.  This is
delicious hot, too!
