friends with a copy of these instructions. The rest will be used to
make your two loaves of bread.

To the starter that you've already got in the bowl add flour, oil,
sugar, Nuts (chopped), milk, eggs, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla
extract, baking soda, salt and Vanilla instant pudding

Mix well and pour into 2 well greased AND sugared loaf pans.

Bake 40-50 min at 350.

Cool for about 10 min before removing from pans. Freezes well. You
may also if you wish add some decadence to this if you like. I've
tried coconut, apples, and raspberries on different loaves all with
good results, although it's marvelous just as it is. From: Joe
