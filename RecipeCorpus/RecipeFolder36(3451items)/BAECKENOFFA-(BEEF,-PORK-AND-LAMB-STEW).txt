Cut each type of meat into 6 even pieces. Put them into 3 separate
bowls and sprinkle generously with white wine. Cover the bowls and
refrigerate for at least 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 160 oC (325
oF). In a flameproof earthenware casserole, heat the goose fat over
low heat, put in the onions and sweat for several minutes. Lay the
leek on top of the onions, then the potatoes. Add the 'bouquet
garni', peppercorns and garlic and arrange the 3 meats separately on
top, one type to the left, one in the middle, one in the right. Pour
over the marinade and the remaining whine. Salt lightly, add the
chicken stock and lay the pieces of calf's foot on top. Put the lid
on the casserole. Mix the flour with a little cold water to make a
soft paste. Spread this paste between the top of the casserole and
the lid to make an airtight seal. Cook in the low oven for 4 hours.
Present the casserole at the table just as is. Break the seal and
lift off the lid.
