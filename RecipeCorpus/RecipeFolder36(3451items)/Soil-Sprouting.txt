Title: Soil Sprouting
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------METHOD AND INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------
Soil sprouting works best for sprouting tiny greens for salads or for
wheat, rye, or triticale grasses.

1. Spread a one inch layer of equal parts of moist peat moss and top
soil over the bottom of a box.

2. Soak the seeds in 3 times as much water as you have seeds and soak
for the time given in the recipe; rinse and jar sprout for 16 to 24
hours.

3. Spread the seeds over the soil in the box.

4. Cover with plastic wrap and then newspaper or black plastic to
keep out the light.

5. When the sprouts are one inch tall, remove the cover and move them
into sunlight so that chlorophyll can develop and turn the leaves
green. Water as needed.

6. When greens are the desired height, about 2 to 3 inches, pull or
cut them, wash them well, and use them in salads. To store, put in
plastic bag and refrigerate.

7. Wash and dry all equipment and put away for next use.
