Hash comes from the French word "hacher", meaning to cut up.  This
popular American dish is the best use of your leftovers.  You'll
never miss the red meat.

1.  Place diced potato in a small saucepan and add enough salted
water to bring to a boil and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until just
tender.  Drain and set aside.

2.  Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over
medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until just wilted,
about 5 minutes. Add the peppers and cook, shaking the pan, for 5
minutes longer.

3.  Raise the heat to medium-high and add the remaining oil, the
chicken and potatoes.  Sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper. Cook,
stirring, over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Weight down the hash
with a heavy plate or pot lid and cook for 5 minutes. Turn the hash
over with a spatula and cook, weighted down, for another 5 minutes or
until it is slightly hrowned.

4.  Add the apple and parsley; cook over medium-high heat, turning
with a spatula, for 5 minutes more. Serve topped with eggs and chili
sauce, if desired.
