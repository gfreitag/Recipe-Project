Title: Chicken Liver Pate
Categories: Meats, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
2    Garlic cloves
4 oz Butter
8 oz Chicken livers
4 sl Bacon
1    Onion
This recipe was given to me by a friend some years ago; we've both
found it a great favourite with everyone we've fed it to.

Peel the garlic and onion, remove rind from the bacon.  Roughly chop
the garlic, onion, liver and bacon and fry gently in some of the
butter until cooked through.

Puree in food processor or blender, adding extra liquid if necessary.

Stir in the remaining butter cut in small pieces while the pate is
still hot. (I simply put it in the processor at the same time as the
other ingredients; this works fine).

Turn into serving bowl and store in the refrigerator when cold.
