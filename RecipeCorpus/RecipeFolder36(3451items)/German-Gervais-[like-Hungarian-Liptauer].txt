Title: German Gervais [like Hungarian Liptauer]
Categories: Aust/german, Desserts, Appetizers, Dips/spread, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Paprika
Salt to taste
1 pk Gervais cheese
1 ts Onion; minced
1 ts Caraway seeds
Mash cheese until softened. Mix in other ingredients. Serve with
gherkins, radishes, Westphalian rye bread, butter and pretzels.

Or serve with crackers and fresh fruit as a dessert.

If using Camembert, this dish is known as Camembert Liptauer in
Germany. In Hungary a similar flavored spread is made with Liptauer
cheese. If these cheeses aren't available substitute cottage cheese
made smooth in a blender and mixed with an equal amount of softened
butter or cream cheese.

Other flavorings could include: capers, anchovy paste, prepared
mustard, chives, Worcestershire sauce.
