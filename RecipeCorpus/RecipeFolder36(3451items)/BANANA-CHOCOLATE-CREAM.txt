grated chocolate. May be refrigerated for 3 to 4 hours before serving
if desired. Arrange orange sections around side of each dish as a

Combine the milk and the vanilla pod in a small saucepan. Cook over
medium heat to just below the boiling point. Combine the flour and
sugar in a medium mixing bowl, blending well. Add the egg yolks and
beat thoroughly with an electric mixer. Remove the vanilla pod from
the milk (then dry and store for later use). Pour the milk slowly
into the flour mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until
well blended. Pour the milk mixture into the top of a double boiler.
Cook over boiling water, stirring constantly, until the custard is
thick and smooth. Cool to lukewarm.
