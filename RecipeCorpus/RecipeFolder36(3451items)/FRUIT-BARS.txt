Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 24 servings
2/3 c  Dried apricots; chopped
1/2 c  Pitted dates; chopped
1/2 c  Pitted prunes; chopped
3/4 c  Butter
1/4 c  Brown sugar (packed)
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
2 3/4 c  Rolled oats
Preheat oven to 400 F (205 C).  Grease a shallow 11" x 7" baking pan
with butter.  Put butter, sugar and corn syrup in a large saucepan;
stir continuously over medium heat until melted.  Remove from heat.
Stir rolled oats into melted mixture.  Spread half of mixture in
bottom of pan to form a thin layer.  Press with the back of a spoon
to compact the mixture and smooth the top.  In a medium-size bowl,
mix apricots, dates and prunes together.  Sprinkle evenly over top of
packed mixture.  Spread remaining mixture on top of fruit; press with
spoon again.  Bake about 20 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool 5
minutes.  Using a knife, mark surface of mixture with lines to use as
a guide for cutting.  Leave in pan to cool completely.  Cut in
squares, then lift out with a small spatula. Store in an airtight
container in a cool place for up to 1 week.
