Shrub is traditionally sipped after the meal, as you would a cordial
or liqueur. It can also be mixed with an equal volume of rum, stirred
with ice, and served as an aperitif.

Wash the fruits. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest in strips,
avoiding the bitter white pith. Combine the citrus zest, cinnamon
sticks, cloves, allspice, vanilla bean, 2 cups sugar, and 2 cups
water in a saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce the heat to the
lowest possible setting, and let the ingredients infuse for 30 min.
Strain the syrup into a large mixing bowl.

Combine the remaining 1 cup sugar and  1/2 cup water in a large, deep,
heavy saucepan Cover the pan and bring the mixture to a boil. Uncover
and cook the mixture over high heat until it caramelizes, about 5
min. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool for 5 min.

Add 1 cup rum to the caramel. Be careful; the mixture may spatter.
When the spattering has subsided, return the pan to low heat and cook
the mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the caramel has
dissolved in the rum.

Add the caramel mixture and remaining rum to the citrus-flavored
syrup. Whisk to mix. Using a funnel, pour the mixture into clean
bottles. Seal with corks.

You can drink the shrub now, but it will be even better if you leave
it for a week or so to let the flavors blend. Store in a cool, dark
place.
