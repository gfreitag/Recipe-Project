Title: Plain Granola
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 4 pounds
1/2 c  Pine nuts
1/2 c  Shelled, unsalted
Pistachio nuts
1/2 c  Shelled pecans
Coarsely chopped
3/4 c  Honey
1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 lb Rolled oats
1 1/2 c  Shelled, unsalted
Sunflower seeds
1 1/2 c  Slivered almonds
1 c  Shredded coconut
3/4 c  Shelled, unsalted
Pumpkin seeds
Preheat the oven to 325 F.

Place the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and combine well.
Slowly stir in the honey and vanilla, making sure that each grain is
evenly coated. Spread the granola mixture onto an ungreased baking
sheet and bake for 20 min, or until the grains become crisp and very
lightly browned, stirring every 5 min to prevent the granola from
sticking to the pan and burning.

Remove the granola from the oven and let cool. It will get crunchier
as it cools. Can be stored at room temperature in airtight containers
or in the freezer in plastic bags.
