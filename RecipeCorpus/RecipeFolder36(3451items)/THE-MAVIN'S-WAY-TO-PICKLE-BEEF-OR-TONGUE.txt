Categories: Meats, Can/preserv
Yield: 3 lbs
4    Bay Leaves
3 tb Salt
1 ts Saltpeter; seenote
-or

3 lb Beef Brisket or Beef Tongue

Seenote; saltpeter, controversy about the use of this item makes me
add a substitute.
From a well known source I quote; " Use Pure crystalline ascorbic
acid (Vitamin C) instead of saltpeter because pure ascorbic acid
can't do you an iota of harm. Use at the rate of 0.05 percent of the
weight of meat, which works out to 1 gram of crystalline ascorbic
acid for every 4.5 pounds; or rounding it off, to 1/4 teaspoon for 5
pounds, 1/2 teaspoon for 10 pounds, and so on. Add the ascorbic acid
to either the dry cure or the Brine." This from "Putting Food By" a
resource for storing and preservation by the team of Hertzberg,
Vaughn, and Greene.
Buy the brisket well marbled with fat. This is cheaper cut, usually,
but turns out to be more suitable for this recipe. Use the exact
recommended weight of meat because the other ingredients are
calibrated for this. Be especially careful when measuring saltpeter;
use exactly the amount listed. Place the meat in a deep glass bowl or
a stoneware crock. Pour the quart of water into another glass bowl.
Add the remaining ingredients, mix together, and pour over the meat;
add enough water to cover. Tightly cover and refrigerate. It is best
to keep this in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Mark your
calendar: For best results, marinate for 19 days. Every 2 days turn
the meat, using wooden spoons. Add water if necessary, but ONLY A
LITTLE BIT, or the meat might spoil. At the end of the pickling
period, discard the pickling water, and wash the meat with cold
water. It is ready to cook
