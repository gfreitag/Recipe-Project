Title: Kathy Pitts' Onion Rings
Categories: Snacks, Vegetables, Appetizers, Side dish
Yield: 1 batch  Slice large onions into thick slices (about 1/2 inch thick)  Separate
the slices into rings.

Purchase a package of Oriental-style Tempura Mix at the grocery store
(this is sold under the Ka-Me and various other brand names).

Make the mix according to package directions, except substitute cold
beer for the liquid called for in the directions.

Dip the onion rings in the batter, and deep fry until light golden (it
won't and shouldn't get too brown).  The result is a wonderful, crispy
onion ring with a very light batter coating that even people who
usually don't like onion rings seem to enjoy.

This batter is also good for fish, shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried
zucchini, etc.
