Roast Tenderloin of Beef with Mushroom, Onion, and Red Wine Sauce

Boil wine, port, and broth in a heavy, large Dutch oven until
reduced to 6 cups, about 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over
medium-high heat.  Add onions and saute until tender, about 15
minutes. Return onions to skillet.  Add flour and stir 3 minutes.
Stir mushroom mixture into wine mixture. Simmer over medium heat
until thickened and reduced to 6 cups, stirring occasionally, about 1
hour.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day
ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 400F.  Rub tenderloins with olive oil.  Season with
salt and pepper.  Place in a roasting pan.  Roast until thermometer
inserted into thickest part of meat registers 125F, about 40 minutes
for rare.  Remove from oven and let stand 10 minutes.
Rewarm sauce over low heat; mix in any juices from roasting pan.
Slice tenderloins crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Overlap beef
slices on platter.  Spoon some sauce over.  Serve, passing remaining
sauce separately.
