Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM----------------MENU MEMORIES; ROYAL CARIBBE---------------------
2 sm Bananas
4    Chicken breasts, boneless
4 sl Ham
MMMMM--------------------------1ST DIP-------------------------------
3 tb Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts White pepper
MMMMM--------------------------2ND DIP-------------------------------
2    Eggs
MMMMM--------------------------3RD DIP-------------------------------
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
3 tb Coconut, shredded
Split bananas lengthwise.  Pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
flat. Place ham slice on chicken, and top with half banana.  Roll
chicken breast and refrigerate to firm.

Season rolled chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in flour.  Mix
coconut and bread crumbs together and set aside.  Dip chicken rolls in
beaten eggs, then coat with coconut mixture.

Preheat oven to 350.  Deep fry chicken in 250-degree oil for two
minutes until lightly colored.  Bake chicken rolls on buttered sheet
pan for 10 minutes or until done.  Garnish with twisted orange slice
or parsley sprig.

Sylvia's comments: rather than deep-frying anything, I simply baked
them for 15 minutes; they were perfectly cooked, moist and tender.
This is a nice dish to prepare for company, when you want something
that can be mostly made ahead, looks somewhat fancy, and tastes very
nice.  I don't think the banana added much, I'll try apple or peach
slices next time. Even my 6- and 4-year-olds liked it!
