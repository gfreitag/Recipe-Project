A bit heavier than traditional scones, because of the whole-wheat
flour.

Preheat oven to 450F (230C).  Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
Sift self-rising flour and salt into a large bowl; stir in
whole-wheat flour. With your fingers, rub in butter until mixture is
crumbly.  Make a well in center of mixture.  Pour in 1/2 cup milk and
the honey and mix well.  Add bananas and mix with a fork to form a
soft dough.  Turn out onto a floured surface and knead lightly.  Roll
out with a floured rolling pin or pat dough with your hands to make a
round about 3/4-inch thick.  Cut in rounds with 2-inch fluted or
plain cookie cutter.  Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet;
brush tops lightly with milk.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until well
risen and browned on bottom.  Transfer to a wire rack and cool 5
minutes.  Split and serve warm with butter.  Makes about 16 scones.
