START ABOUT 3-1/2 HOURS BEFORE SERVING OR EARLY IN DAY.

1. In large bowl, combine yeast, sugar, mashed potato powder, salt,
and 1-1/2 cups flour. In 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, heat
1-1/3 cups water and 6 tablespoons margarine or butter (3/4 stick)
until very warm (120F to 130F). Margarine or butter does not need to
melt.

2. With mixer at low speed, gradually beat liquid into dry
ingredients; beat 2 minutes, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber
spatula. Beat in eggs and remaining 2 cups flour to make a thick
batter; continue beating 2 minutes.

3. Cover bowl. Let batter rise in warm place (80F to 85F) until
doubled, about 1-1/4 hours) Stir down dough; cover and let rise again
until almost doubled, about 1 hour.

4. Preheat oven to 350F. Grease 15-1/2" by 10-1/2" jelly-roll pan.
Stir down dough, spread in pan.

5. In 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, heat brown sugar, cinnamon,
and 6 tablespoons margarine or butter (3/4 stick) until melted and
smooth, stirring occasionally. With lightly floured finger, make deep
indentations over entire surface of dough, spacing them about 1"
apart and pressing almost to bottom of pan. Pour brown sugar mixture
over dough and spread with spatula to cover evenly. Bake 20 to 25
minutes until coffee cake pulls away slightly from sides of pan and
brown sugar topping is bubbly. Cool cake slightly on wire rack.

6. In cup, stir confectioners' sugar and milk; drizzle over coffee
cake. Serve warm. Or, cool completely to serve later. Makes 16
servings. Each serving: about 260 calories, 10g fat, 27mg
