Yield: 24 servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
Sliced
3    Green onion -- sliced
1/2 lb Boneless skinless chicken
Breasts
3    Dried black mushrooms
2 oz Dried bean thread noodles
1 sm Carrot -- julienned
1 c  Napa cabbage -- thinly
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1/4 ts Chinese five spice
1 tb Oil -- for frying
12    Spring roll wrappers
Oil -- for deep frying
2 tb Chicken broth
1 tb Oyster sauce
1/2 ts Sesame oil
2 ts Cornstarch
Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 15
minutes, drain.  Trim stems and thinly slice caps.  Soak bean threads
in warm water to cover until softened, about 15 minutes; drain.  Cut
bean thread noodles into 4" lengths.  Combine mushrooms and bean
thread noodles in a bowl and add remaining filling ingredients; mix
well.  Cut chicken into thin slices then cut slices into thin strips.
Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add chicken and stir to coat.
Let stand for 10 minutes.  Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add
1 tbsp oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add chicken and stir-fry for 30
seconds.  Remove the chicken mixture to a bowl and let cool.  To make
each spring roll, place a triangular wrapper on work surface with
long side facing you; keep remaining wrappers covered to prevent
drying.  Place 2 tbsp filling in a band along base of wrapper. Fold
bottom over filling, then fold in left and right sides.  Brush edges
with water and roll up to completely enclose filling.  Heat oil in a
wok to 360.  Deep-fry springrolls, a few at a time, and cook, turning
occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain
on paper towels.
