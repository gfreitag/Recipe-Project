tbs and process as usual.

Clean the mushrooms and remove the stems. If the mushrooms are large,
slice them.

In a blender or food processor, combine the vinegar, herbs, and  1/4
cup eater and process until smooth. If necessary, run the puree
through a fine sieve to remove residual stem bits of herbs.

Combine the herb mixture and oil in a large saute pan and begin to
