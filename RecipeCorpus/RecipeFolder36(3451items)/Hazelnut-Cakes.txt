Title: Hazelnut Cakes
Categories: Guestchefs, Nuts/grains, Cake/cookie
Yield: 5 dozen
1/8 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
White sugar
1 lb Hazelnut meats (blanched
-or unblanched is okay)
6    Egg whites
2 3/4 c  Brown sugar, sifted
BF>    Hazelnuts are available at most stores under the name of
Filberts. BF>    They should be blanched.  To blanch, boil the nuts
for 5 minutes and BF>    when they are cool enough to handle, remove
the skins.  To grind, BF>    place about 1/4 cup at a time in a
blender, or chop as finely as you BF>    can with a sharp knife.

Grind nuts. Beat egg whites with salt until stiff. Add sugar to egg
whites a little at a time, beating constantly. Add vanilla and then
carefully fold in nuts. Shape into 1" balls and roll in sugar to
coat. Bake on a greased sheet at 325 for about 15 min, maybe 20.

Tip from Joy of Cooking: 2 lb hazelnuts in the shell = 1 lb nut meats.
