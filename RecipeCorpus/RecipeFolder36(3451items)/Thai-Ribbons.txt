very warm rolls. Rolls are best when served warm.
CARAMEL STICKY BUNS & TOPPING: In a sauce pan or in your microwave
oven combine
butter, brown sugar and corn syrup.  Heat and stir until blended. Pour
topping into the bottom of the pan (pans) you are using for the rolls,
place
unbaked cinnamon rolls on top on the caramel sauce. Allow to rise in
a warm place until double in size (about 1 hour). Preheat oven to
350-degrees. Bake
for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly brown. After removing pans from
oven, cover with foil; invert onto cooling racks, cool 1 minute, and
remove pan. Cool before serving.
Traditionally the heart-shaped moulds were made of wicker; now china
ones are used.  If you decide to use cream cheese, make sure it is
unsalted.
