butterfly the loin with a sharp knife and flatten. Place a quarter of
filling ingredients in each loin in order of listing. Roll up each
loin tightly.  Roll one sheet of nori around the loin. To cook lamb
loin:  melt butter and oil in a teflon pan. Roll loin around in pan
just long enough to cook.  Do not cook over too high heat or nori
will shrink from the loin.  Transfer to a baking dish and bake in a
preheated 190C oven for 5-10 mins.  Turning 2-3 times until the lamb
loin is firm and cooked.  Serve it cut or whole with rice and fresh
vegetables. Note* To prepare egg roll: make as an omelette, roll and
cut into thin strips. Recipe compliments of Magnus Johansson.
