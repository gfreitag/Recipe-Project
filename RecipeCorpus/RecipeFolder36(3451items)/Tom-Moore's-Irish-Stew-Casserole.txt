Title: Tom Moore's Irish Stew Casserole
Categories: Scot/irish, Meats, Soup/stew, Casseroles
Yield: 2 servings
1    Onion, thinly sliced
pn [generous] rosemary
Chicken or lamb stock
Salt, pepper to taste
1 lb Lean lamb, the shoulder
-or leg, cut into 1" dice
2    Potatoes, peeled and
-thinly sliced
Layer one third of the potatoes in a small casserole.  Top with half
the lamb and half the onion.  Sprinkle lightly with rosemary, salt
and pepper. Repeat layers, ending with a final layer of potato.  Add
enough chicken stock to almost cover the stew.

Cover the casserole and bake in a 325 oven until the lamb is quite
tender and the potatoes begin to almost dissolve and thicken the
mixture. (1- 1 1/2 hours)

I've made this in larger quantities in a crock pot.  In this case, the
cooking time will be about 8-10 hours.

I got these directions for making Irish Stew (no real recipe) from the
owner of Tom Moore's Tavern in Bermuda (don't know how authentic it
is, as the gentleman was German, but it IS good) .
