Title: Portobello Stems with Potatoes and Garlic
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
Cleaned stems from
4 lg Fresh portobellos
Sliced in 1/2" rounds
Spanish paprika
Salt
1 tb Parsley, chopped
2 lg Russet potatoes, peeled
2 tb Butter
2 tb Vegetable oil
More as needed
1 sm Onion(s), finely chopped
2    Garlic clove(s)
Finely chopped
Slice the potatoes into 1/8-to-1/4-inch-thick round. Then slice the
rounds again into matchstick-size pieces, 1/8-1/4-inch-wide and about
2-3 inches long. Keep covered with cold water until ready to use.

Place the butter and oil in a large saute pan. Heat over medium heat,
then add the potatoes. Fry the potatoes until they begin to brown,
about 4 min. Add the onion and garlic and continue to fry until the
potatoes begin to soften, about 5 min more. Add the mushroom stems
and continue to fry, adding more oil if the mixture is too dry. When
the mushrooms begin to go limp, in about 3 min, add the paprika and
salt to taste. Sprinkle parsley on top and serve.
