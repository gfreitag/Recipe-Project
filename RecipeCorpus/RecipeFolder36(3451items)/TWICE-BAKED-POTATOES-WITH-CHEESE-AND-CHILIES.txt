Title: TWICE-BAKED POTATOES WITH CHEESE AND CHILIES
Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
5 tb Heavy cream
1/2 c  Chedder cheese, grated
+ addl for topping
1/2 c  Sour cream
Black olives (garnish)
4 lg Baking potatoes
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tb Black olives, imported
1/2 c  Green chili peppers, diced,
-mild, canned
Scrub and dry the potatoes. Cut a small, deep slit in the top of
each potato. Set the potatoes on the middle rack of a preheated
375øF. oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender
when pierced with a fork.
Let potatoes cool slightly, cut off the tops and scrape the potato
pulp into a bowl. So not scrape so deeply that you tear the potato
skin. Salt and pepper the potato shells; reserve.
Mash the potato pulp and stir in 4 Tbs chopped olives, diced green
chilies, and enough heavy cream to give the mixture the desired
consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in 1/2 cup
grated cheese.
Divide the potato mixture equally among the shells, mounding the
filling slightly. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and place on
baking sheet.
Bake again at 400øF., until potatoes are hot and cheese is
bubbling.
Top each potato with a generous dollop of sour cream, and add a
black olive if you like. Serve immediately.
