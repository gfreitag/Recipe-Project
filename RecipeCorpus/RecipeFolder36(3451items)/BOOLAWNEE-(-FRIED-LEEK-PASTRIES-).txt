Oil for deep frying
Sift flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the centre and add
water. Mix to a firm dough and knead for 5 minutes until elastic,
dusting with more flour if necessary.  Wrap in plastic film and leave
to rest for 30 minutes.
Cut most of the green tops from leeks, halve lengthwise and rinse
well to remove all traces of soil between leaves.  Remove roots and
dry leeks with paper towels.  Place flat on board, cut along length
at 5 mm (1/4 inch) intervals than across to dice.  Measure in cup
measure and place in bowl. Add salt and chili pepper and knead with
hand to soften leeks.   Stir in oil.
Roll pieces of dough into balls the size of a large hazelnut and roll
thinly into a 10 cm (4 inch) circle.  Alternatively roll out dough
and cut into 10 cm (4 inch) rounds.  Place about 2 teaspoons leek
filling in centre of circle, moisten pastry half way round edge of
circle and fold pastry over filling.  Press edge to seal well, and
using the edge of a thimble, (the traditional method) or a coffee
spoon make little crescent- shaped marks around the edge, or press
with fork. Fry 3 or 4 at a time in hot oil until golden brown,
turning to brown evenly. Drain on paper towels and serve hot or warm.
