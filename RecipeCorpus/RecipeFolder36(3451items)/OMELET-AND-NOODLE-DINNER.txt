into a work bowl. Add scallions, ham and soy sauce. Sprinkle in
cornstarch and mix well. Add eggs and water, and mix. Set the mixture
aside. Cook the noodles for 5 minutes in boiling salted water. Drain
and set aside. Combine sesame oil, garlic and ginger in a soup pot
and place over low heat. Cook 1 minute. Add pepper flakes, broth,
clam juice, soy sauce, vinegar and sherry. Cover, increase heat to
medium, and boil 5 minutes. Heat oil (about 3/8-inch depth) in a
large skillet over high heat and add 3-ounce ladles of the egg
mixture. Cook until edges puff, about 1 minute, flip and cook on the
other side for about 30 seconds. Remove omelets and drain on towels.
Cover and keep warm while preparing others. When it's time for
dinner, divide noodles and broth between 4 soup bowls. Make a bed of
shredded lettuce. Arrange omelets on top of lettuce. Toss some
cilantro on top and serve.
