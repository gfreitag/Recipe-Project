Title: Atholl Brose
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, Scot/irish, Holiday
Yield: 1 quart
Or other flavor honey
1 qt Scotch whiskey
3 tb Rolled oats
2 tb Heather honey
Place the oatmeal in a mixing bowl and add just enough cold water to
make a thin paste. Let stand for about 1 hour, then strain through a
fine sieve into a large clean bowl, pressing the oatmeal against the
sieve with the back of a spoon to release as much liquid as possible.
Discard the oatmeal.

Mix the oatmeal liquid with the honey, then add the Scotch. Rebottle
the liquid and shake well before serving either straight up or with a
mixer.

Note: Atholl Brose is traditionally served in Scotland on New Year's
eve to the first guests crossing the threshold of the host's home,
hence its other name, First Footing.
