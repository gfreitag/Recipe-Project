Notes:
A. Lemongrass, Remove outer leaves of the lemongrass
and bruise or smash the white end with the back of the
knife or a wine bottle. Finely slice the tender white
part at the base of the stalk, discard the tops or
save for your chicken stock. A cuisinart with a 1mm
slicer will slice it just as well but sometimes
smashing is good.
B. Fish Sauce, Nuoc Mam  or Nam Pla. A good brand
name is "Tiparos" from Thailand.
METHOD:
Mix the chicken pieces with the lemongrass,
scallions, vinegar, Nuoc Mam salt and pepper. Set
aside for at least 30 minutes, overnite is better. If
the lemongrass is cut too thick you will have to
remove the slices of lemongrass before you
put it in the wok, if it is cut very thin it will cook
well enough to eat it.
Heat the Wok, add the oil, when the oil is hot add
the chiles and the chicken pieces, stir and cook for 3
or more minutes. Stir and cook over medium heat until
chicken no longer looks pink. Season with sugar and
green chiles or white pepper. Add the chicken stock,
toss over high heat to reduce fluid, and  to cook the
chicken. Thicken if required. Serve in an oval shallow
casserole.
GARNISHES:
Garnish with Nuoc Mam, Peanuts, quartered or sliced
banana blossom, bean sprouts, powdered chile powder,
sliced green chiles, and Coriander.
