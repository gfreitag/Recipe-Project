For hundreds of years in Ulster, a large STRONE was made in the shape
of a cross to celebrate the feast of St. Brigit. Strones were
traditionally served hot and dripping with freshly made butter.

Mix the dry ingredients. Melt the fat in a little boiling water and
use to mix the other ingredients to a stiff dough. Scatter more
oatmeal over it and knead thoroughly. Roll out as thinly as possible,
in a circle. Put on a baking sheet. Cut a cross on top so that when
cooked the oatcake can be easily broken into quarters, the
traditional FARLS. Bake in a moderate oven (350F, Gas 4, 180C) for
about 20 min. Serve with lots of butter.
