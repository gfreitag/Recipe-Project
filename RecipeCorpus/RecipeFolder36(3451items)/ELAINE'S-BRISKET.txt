1/2 c  Ketchup
Ginger ale; to cover
1    Brisket; sear on all sides
-can use chuck roast; or
-other cuts of pot roast
1 c  Whole cranberry sauce
PUT IN ROASTER PAN WITHOUT lid and sear on high heat using oven w/ 450
degree heat.  Turn after about 15 minutes. Now pour ingredients in w/
brisket and cover pan with lid or foil. Pour ginger ale halfway up
pot. (Don't cover meat completely.) Cook at 350 F. for 2-1/2 hours

NOTE:  This is the roast that comes out with a barbecued flavor and
seems to be EVERYONE'S favorite. I made it first on Yuntiv '91. It is
easy and a NO FAIL recipe.
