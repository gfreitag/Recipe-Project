1    Sprig thyme
4 c  Chicken stock
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Dried navy bean
2 tb Olive oil

Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them.

Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy stock pot. Add
the onion and garlic and saute for 5 min or until the onion becomes
translucent. Add the bay leaf and thyme and saute for 1 min. Add the
beans and chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce

Uncover the pot and skim the surface of the liquid from time to time

Remove the pot from the heat, season the beans with salt and pepper to
taste, and drain off any excess liquid. Remove the bay leaf and serve
or save for use in any recipe that calls for cooked navy beans.
