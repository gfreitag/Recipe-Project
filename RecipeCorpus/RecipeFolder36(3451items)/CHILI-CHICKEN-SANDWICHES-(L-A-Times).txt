Combine flour, chili powder, salt and pepper in large plastic bag.
Shake well to combine. Add chicken breasts and toss until breasts are
coated.
Heat oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add
onion and sear for 1 minute, then push to side. Add chicken breasts
in single layer. Brown on 1 side, about 2 1/2 minutes. Turn and brown
other side. Continue cooking until just cooked through, about 3
minutes more (use tip of sharp knife to pierce through thickest part
of chicken; juices should run clear, not pink). During cooking, stir
onion on side of pan to avoid burning. Remove pan from heat.
Cut chicken into shreds and return to pan with onion. Add hot sauce
and barbecue sauce and toss well to combine. Adjust seasoning and hot
sauce. (Can be made to this point a day ahead and refrigerated,
tightly covered). Gently reheat before serving.
Divide lettuce among 6 bottom buns and top with chicken mixture.
Close with top buns and lightly press together.
Makes 6 servings.
