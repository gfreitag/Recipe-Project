Title: APPLESAUCE TREASURE LOAF
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 loaves
2 c  Sweetened canned applesauce
1 1/2 c  Quaker Oats, uncooked
-- (quick or old-fashioned)
1 c  Raisins
1 c  Pitted dates
-- cut in small pieces
1 c  Candied red cherries
-- cut in small pieces
1 c  Chopped nutmeats
1 c  Shortening; soft
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
4    Eggs
2 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Soda
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Cinnamon
3/4 ts Cloves
3/4 ts Nutmeg
Beat shortening and sugar together until creamy.  Add eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition.  Sift together 2 cups of the
flour, baking powder, soda, salt and spices.  Add alternately with
applesauce to creamed mixture; blend well.  Stir in oats.

Combine remaining 1/2 cup flour with raisins, dates, cherries and
nutmeats; stir to coat fruits and nutmeats evenly with flour.  Stir
into batter.  Pour into 2 greased and waxed paper-lined 8-1/2" x
4-1/2" x 2-1/2" loaf pans.

Bake in preheated very slow oven (275 F.) about 2 hours.  Set pan of
hot water in bottom of oven while loaves are baking.  Loosen edges;
cool on wire rack about 10 minutes.  Remove from pans; cool
thoroughly.  Wrap cooled bread and store one day before slicing.
