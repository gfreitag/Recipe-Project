4    (5-oz) halibut fillets*

Make fish stock by simmering 1 to 2 pounds heads and bones of
white-fleshed fish only in 2 to 3 quarts of water about 2 hours. Add
water as needed. Strain stock into large kettle. Add clam juice,
beer, carrots, celery, garlic, leek and saffron. Bring to boil,
reduce heat and simmer until carrots are crisp-tender. Combine
cornstarch with 1/2 cup wine and stir into simmering sauce. Simmer 5
minutes, then season to taste with salt, white pepper, hot pepper
sauce and MSG. Add lobster tails, shrimp (that have been split down
back and sand vein removed), scallops, clams and halibut. Add
remaining 1 1/2 cups wine. Bring to boil and boil 8 to 10 minutes or
until lobster is done and clams open. Serve in large bowls with
generous amounts of liquid. Serve garlic toast or hot crisp sourdough
bread slices with Bouillabaisse, if desired.
