Title: SALSA
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Relishes
Yield: 2 servings
MMMMM--------------------FOR ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS-------------------------
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
tb 1-2 wine vinegar
1 ts Hot pepper sauce
14 oz Can whole tomatoes in juice
1 sm Onion
1    Spring Onion
1/4-1/2 cup loosely packed
Basil or coriander leaves.
Drain the can of tomatoes.  Chop the onion into quarters and put into
a food processor with both the green top and the bottom of the spring
onion.
Using the metal chopping blade process briefly, to chop the onions
(overprocessing will pulp the onions and the salsa will lose its
texture).
Add remaining ingredients and again process briefly, just
:
until the tomatoes and herbs are chopped, but not pureed.
Taste, and add more vinegar if you feel that it is necessary,
:
and more hot pepper sauce if you require a hotter flavour.
Allow to stand for about an hour before serving to let the
:
flavours blend.  The mixture will thicken on standing, and should be
stirred well before serving.
