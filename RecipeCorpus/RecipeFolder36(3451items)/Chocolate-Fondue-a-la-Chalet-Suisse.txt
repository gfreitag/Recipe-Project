Title: Chocolate Fondue a la Chalet Suisse
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Kirsch, brandy or Cointreau
3    3-oz bars Toblerone
1/2 c  Light or heavy cream
(A note from Diane Duane: This recipe I include because of personal
interest.  It was invented in the 1950's at the New York restaurant
of an old friend of ours, Konrad Egli.  Konni is now retired, and
Chalet Suisse is unhappily long gone:  but the dessert lives on, and
has made its way back to Switzerland.)

Break the Toblerone into separate triangular pieces.  Combine all the
ingredients in a saucepan or small chafing dish.  Stir over *low* heat
until the chocolate is melted and smooth.  Serve in a chafing dish
over low heat.

For dunkables, serve each person a plate with one, or a combination,
of the following:

Angelfood cake, or ladyfingers, cut in chunks
Orange or tangerine slides, strawberries, bananas
Profiteroles of puff pastry
