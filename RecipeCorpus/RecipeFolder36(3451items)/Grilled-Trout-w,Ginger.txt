2 1/2 lb Trout
Salt; to taste
1/2 ts 5 spice powder
2 tb Peanut oil; or salad oil
Wash fish and clean cavity thoroughly with paper towels dipped in
salt. Rinse and dry. Make 3 or 4 shallow diagonal cuts in each side
of the fish and rub well with a little salt and the five-spice
powder. Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the *finely shredded
spring onions and ginger until soft but not brown. Remove from heat
and add the soy sauce and sesame oil. Spoon some of the mixture into
the cavity of each fish, and brush the remainder over the skin.
Marinate for at least 15 minutes, then place fish in a grilling
basket and barbecue over medium heat until the skin has browned
slightly. Flip basket over and cook until the other side is also
done. Serve at once. Gourmet Grilling formatted for M-M by Judy
