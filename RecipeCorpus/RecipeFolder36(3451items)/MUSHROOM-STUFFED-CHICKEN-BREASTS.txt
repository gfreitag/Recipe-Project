The Mushrooms should finely chopped. The chicken breasts should be
boned and skinless, halved (8 pieces) and pounded flat.  Seasoned
bread crumbs may also be used.

Preheat the oven to 350 f.  Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a
skillet. Add the mushrooms (finely chopped), salt and pepper and
cook, stiring often until the mushrooms turn very dark and absorb all
the butter. Remove from the heat.  Add the Italian seasoning to the
bread crumbs. Stir in 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs and the nutmeg.

Divide the mushroom stuffing into 8 portions and place a portion of
the stuffing in the center of each piece of chicken.  Roll the
chicken around the stuffing and place, seam side down, in a buttered
shallow casserole/ baking dish. Melt the remaining tablespoon of
butter and brush over the chicken. Sprinkle with the remaining 3/4
cup of bread crumbs until all the pieces are covered.  Mix the sour
cream with the heated chicken broth and pour over the chicken.  Bake
for 45-60 minutes, until lightly browned.

Also, try a cup of broccoli flowerlets and/or walnuts, finely chopped,
added to the mushroom and breadcrumb mixture.
