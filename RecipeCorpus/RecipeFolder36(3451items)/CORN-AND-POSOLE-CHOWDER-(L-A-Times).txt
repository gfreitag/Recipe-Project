Some soups and chowders come together quickly with great success,
even without the benefit of homemade stock and long simmering. This
is one. The hominy and instant masa enrich the soup with a deep corn
flavor. If you'd like less conventional garnishes, try thin-sliced
radishes, a squeeze of lime juice and fresh oregano leaves.
Simmer cream-style corn, canned corn, hominy, broth, water and
instant masa, onion, cumin and hot sauce in 3-quart saucepan over
medium heat until onion is softened, about 10 minutes. Stir often to
avoid sticking. Add salt to taste. (Can be made a day ahead to this
point and refrigerated, tightly covered). Gently reheat before
serving, stirring often. If soup thickens too much, add water as
needed.
Divide among 6 to 8 bowls and garnish with cilantro leaves, sliced
green onions and diced red bell pepper. Pass extra hot sauce, if
desired.
