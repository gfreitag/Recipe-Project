Title: Royal Icing
Categories: Cake/cookie, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
1 lb Confectioner's sugar
3    Egg whites, room temp.
Sift the entire pound of sugar to remove all the lumps. Place egg
whites in mixing bowl and add sugar and cream of tartar to whites
while stirring.

When all the sugar is incorporated, using an electric mixer, beat
until thick and very white.  Mixture will hold a peak. This should
take 5-7 minutes.

When finished, cover icing tightly with a damp cloth or plastic wrap
as it dries very quickly and will form a crust.

To tint icing, use a small amount of color at a time. Paste food
colors will not change the consistency as liquid colors will. For a
quarter cup of icing, dip the tip of a toothpick into the color, then
into the icing. Stir well.

If you desire more color, dip again.  Proceed gradually. For strong
colors like red, royal blue and dark purple, you will need 1/8
teaspoon to 1/4 cup icing.

Note: If you plan to make several colors, a muffin tin makes a handy
palette.
