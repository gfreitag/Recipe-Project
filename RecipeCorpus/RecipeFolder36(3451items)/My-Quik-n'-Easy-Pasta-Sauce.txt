Title: My Quik n' Easy Pasta Sauce
Categories: Pasta/rice, Salsa/sauce, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
16 oz Tomatoes, canned
Basil to taste
Oregano to taste
Salt and pepper
1 lg Spanish Onion, chopped
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 lb Ground meat
19 oz Tomato puree
Dice the onion but not too finely, while putting on water for pasta.
Saute onions, don't brown, but til they are clear.  Add garlic and
ground meat and cook til all pink is gone from meat.  If using lower
grade meat, pour into a collander to strain out fat.  Return to pan
and add tomato puree and tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt and pepper.
Simmer at enough heat to keep bubbling with out lid to allow the
sauce to reduce a little. Cook pasta ( I prefer linguine) and serve
over pasta.
