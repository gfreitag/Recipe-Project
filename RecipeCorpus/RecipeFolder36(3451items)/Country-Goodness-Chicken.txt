Title: Country Goodness Chicken
Categories: Kooknet, Poultry, Oldies
Yield: 4 servings
1/4    To 1/2 oil, as needed
1 cn 10.5 oz chicken broth
1 c  Hot water
2 tb White wine
1/8 ts Marjoram or thyme
1/2 c  Flour
3    Chicken breasts, skinned
& boned, cut into 1" strips
1/2    To 1 tsp. salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Place the flour in a shallow dish; set aside. Sprinkle the chicken
with salt and pepper; add to the flour a few strips at a time, and
dredge to coat on all sides. In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the
oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, turning to brown on all
sides. Cook for about 10 minutes, adding oil as needed. Pour off the
excess oil, and add the broth and the hot water to the skillet.
Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the wine
and marjoram (Or thyme); cover and cook for 5 minutes more or until
the chicken is fork-tender and no pink remains.

Serve over biscuits or rice with sauce from the pan.

Lin's Notes: Since Pat is a gravy lover, I didn't add the water.
Instead, I used a 13.5 oz can of chicken broth, and added only enough
water to make 2 cups of liquid. As well, since I love chicken
seasoning (either store-bought or Paul Prudhomme's) I added a few
sprinkles over the floured chicken, and a bit more on the chicken
while it was browning. Finally, when the chicken was simmering, I
added one jar of Heinz Fat-Free Chicken Gravy to the mixture, and let
it simmer. I didn't use the wine either, and it was absolutely
TERRIFIC!!!
