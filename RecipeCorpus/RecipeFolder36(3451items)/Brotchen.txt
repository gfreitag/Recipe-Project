German goodies have you become addicted to?  You can get bratwurst
here these days, some of the Knorr instant soups, the potato dumpling
mixes,

Karin, I too lived in Germany for many years and became addicted to
these wonderful rolls. Thought I would send you the recipe for them
just to take you back a little. Just be sure and use REAL butter when
you try them as it will transport you back to those wonderful
Saturday mornings when you could get these fresh downtown!! From:
