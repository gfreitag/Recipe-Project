Title: Honey Mustard Dressing
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Dress/stuff
Yield: 6 cups
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
(other kinds are too acid)
1 qt Real mayonnaise
1 c  Country style dijon
3/4 c  Honey
Combine the 4 ingredients and use immediately or let chill. Improves
with aging for at least 3-4 hours.

I make this every other day at the restaurant that I work at. It is
more of a dressing then a sauce. We put it on a fried chicken salad.
I like it with a hot ham and cheese sandwich or on cold roast beef.
We have even basted broiled chicken beasts with it as they cook.
Needs to be watched carefully though for it can and does burn easily.
