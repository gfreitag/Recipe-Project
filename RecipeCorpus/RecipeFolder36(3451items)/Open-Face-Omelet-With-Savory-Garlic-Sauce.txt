brown lightly on the other side.  Slide omelet onto a warm serving
plate.  Cut into 6 to 8 wedges.  Place a saucepan over high heat
until hot.  Add remaining 1/2 tbsp oil; swirling to coat sides.  Add

Add tomatoes, water chestnuts, peas and sauce; bring to a boil.  Add
cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and
thickens.  Pour over omelet and serve.
