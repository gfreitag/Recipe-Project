Categories: Side dish, Pasta/rice, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Pepper
2    Leeks, washed and trimmed
4    Blood oranges, peeled
1 tb Canola oil
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Long-grain wild rice
2 1/2 c  Chicken stock

1 tb Orange zest
1    Clove
1/4 ts Salt
Place the rice in a fine sieve and pick over it. Rinse well under cold
running water. Drain.

Bring the stock to a boil in a large, heavy saucepan. Add the rice,
bay leaf, orange zest, clove, salt and pepper. Reduce to a simmer and
cook, uncovered, for 45 min to 1 hour. Drain any extra cooking
liquid. Cover and let stand 10 min.

Cut the leeks into crosswise rounds, about 1/16-inch thick. Segment
the oranges over a bowl, reserving any juice that falls into the bowl.

Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the
leeks and saute for 2 min. Add the oranges and saute for 1 min more.
Add any reserved orange juice and the sugar, stirring well. Let the
mixture cool slightly, then fold into the wild rice and serve.
