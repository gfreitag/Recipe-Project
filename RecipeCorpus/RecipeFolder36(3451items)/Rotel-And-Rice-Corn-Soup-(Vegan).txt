Title: Rotel And Rice Corn Soup (Vegan)
Categories: Soup/stew, Pasta/rice, Tomatoes
Yield: 1 servings
2    To 3 corn tortillas, cut in
-2 inch strips <--optional
-in place of rice
1/2    Red pepper, seeded and
-cut into strips
10 oz Diced rotel tomatoes, with
-liquid
1 1/2 c  Cooked rice
1/2 pk Frozen corn (about 1c)
3 c  Vegetable stock (to 4c)
-or water
Saute the red pepper in a little bit of the broth.  Add tomatoes,
cooked rice, corn and stock to the pot, and heat thoroughly, about 10
mins or so. Just before serving, stir in tortilla strips.

Tracey's note:  I think the spiciness of the Rotel provides enough
seasoning, but a little pepper, fresh cilantro. onion, etc might be
nice as well.  Think of this recipe as a base for a spicy soup and
expirament!

Lisa's note:  I have a feeling the tortilla strips are NOT optional as
described above.
