Title: About Jams, Jellies and Preserves -2

Yield: 1 text file  Making juice for jelly: Wash and drain fruit. Prick or crush the
fruit. Add water if fruit is not juicy enough eg. apples. Add enough
to the kettle that you can see it through the fruit but the fruit is
not floating. Cook uncovered until the fruit is soft and loosing its
color. Have ready a jelly bag [several layers of cheese cloth] . Wet
it, wring it out and line a strainer with it. Let the juice drip
through without squeezing it as this muddies and flavors the jelly.
This juice can be kept up to 6 months before proceeding by freezing
or canning it.

Making jelly: Measure the strained juice and put it in an enamel or
stainless steel pan. Simmer 5 min. Skim off froth. Measure and warm
sugar in a pan in the oven and add it. Stir until dissolved. Cook at
a gentle simmer until the point of jelling. To test, place a small
amount of jelly on a spoon, cool it slightly and let it drop back
into the pot from the side of the spoon. As the syrup thickens, 2
large drops will form along the edge of the spoon. when these two
drops run together and fall as a single drop the "sheeting" stage has
been reached- 220 to 222 deg F and the jelly will be firm when
cooled. It can take anywhere from 10 to 30 min for jelly to reach
this stage depending on the fruit and the amount of sugar. Take the
jars from the sterilizing bath and invert on a cake cooler. They
should be hot but dry when filled. Fill to 1/4" from the top. Cover
with melted paraffin 1/8" deep.
