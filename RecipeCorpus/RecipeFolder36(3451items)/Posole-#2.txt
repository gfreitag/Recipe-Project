1    Cabbage; thinly sliced

Soak hominy in enough water to cover for 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Place in a large pot with water to cover; simmer 2 to 3 hours, or
until tender. Taste as you go since some posole cooks quicker than
others.

Combine the meats, bouillon cubes, garlic, onions, bay leaves and
water in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a low
simmer. Spoon off any scum that comes to the top. Cook over low heat
for about 2 hours, then add the chicken. Simmer for another 1 1/2 to
2 1/2 hours, or until the meats are very tender, the chicken tender
but not falling apart, and the broth extremely flavorful. About 30
minutes before the broth is ready, add the hominy.

Serve the posole in bowls; a few big spoonfuls of hominy, the rich
broth, a chunk or two of the various meats. Have an array of
condiments on the table for each diner to add to his bowl.
