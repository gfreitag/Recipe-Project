on ice cream or cakes.  Do not refrigerate the starter liquid. Now
you are ready to prepare the fruit for the cakes.

SECOND STAGE

In a large (one-gallon) jar or container, put starter, 2 1/2 cups
sugar & peaches.  Mix well & cover the jar with a paper towel. Do not
refrigerate or screw lid on jar. Stir every day for 10 days. Next,
add 2 1/2 cups sugar & pineapple.  Stir every day for 10 days. Add 2
1/2 cups sugar & fruit cocktail. Slice cherries & add with juice.
Stir everyday for 10 days. On baking day, drain fruit & divide it
into four equal parts. Save the juice & use for starter for friends
who want to make this treat. You will have enough for five starters
(about 2 cups each). You can save this fruit mixture by refrigerating
the remaining part, but it should be used as soon as possible. Do not
refrigerate the liquid, because it will stop the fermenting action,
and you want to give this to friends for their cakes.

CAKE Combine cake mix, instant pudding mix, cooking oil & eggs. Beat
until smooth.  Fold in chopped nut & 1 portion of fruit. The batter
will be thick.  Pour mixture into a greased tube pan. Bake at 350
degrees for 50 to 60 minutes.  Turn out while hot.  When cooled the
cake freezes very well. The choice of which cake mixes, as well as
pudding mixes is yours. White, yellow or fruit flavored cake mixes,
as well as any of the fruit-flavored pudding mixes can be used.
Coconut may be substituted for the nuts. From: Marlon Bagley
