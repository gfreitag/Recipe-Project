Categories: Main dish, Pasta/rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 ts Garlic, minced
1/2 c  Mushrooms, diced
2 c  Roma tomatoes, diced
1/4 lb Tofu, firm, diced
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 ts Garlic, granulated
2 ts Basil
1 ts Rosemary
1/4 c  Sun-dried tomatoes
16 oz Spaghetti
1/2 c  Onion, diced
1/2 c  Celery, diced
1/2 c  Carrots, diced
1/2 c  Red bell pepper, diced
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Zucchini, diced
1/2 c  Eggplant, peeled & seeded,
-- diced
Soak sun-dried tomatoes in boiling water until soft, about 10 minutes.
Dice & set aside.

Cook spaghetti according to instructions, rinse, drain & set aside.

Heat oil & saute onion, celery, carrots & red bell pepper in a large
skillet until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.  Stir in
the sun-dried tomatoes followed by the zucchini, eggplant, garlic,
mushrooms, tomatoes & tofu.  Cook over a low heat until the liquid
has evaporated.

Stir in the rest of the ingredients.  Place spaghetti on a large
serving platter, top with sauce & serve.

Mark's Notes: Ensure that these vegetables are finely diced so that
they can cook quickly & you can get a medley of tastes in your mouth.
I do not cook the spaghetti while the sauce is cooking.  While there
is a risk of overcooking when the vegetables are diced this small, I
still prefer to cook my sauce, let it sit to allow the flavours to
develop & then serve over freshly cooked pasta.  I hate cold pasta
with hot sauces.  Also, add a handful of finely chopped fresh parsley
just before serving.
