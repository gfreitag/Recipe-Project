Categories: Pasta/rice, Fish/seafoo, Italian, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
12    Scallops
1/2 c  White wine
2 lb Mussels
28 oz Tomatoes, canned
1/4 c  Basil, fresh, shredded
1 lb Linquini
2 tb Olive oil
3    Shallots chopped
- or green onions
1 ts Grated lemon rind
1/2 ts Red chili pepper flakes
2 tb Parsley, chopped
12 lg Shrimp or prawns
Serve pasta and sauce in a large bowl on the table and let people help
themselves. Vary the seafood according to your tastes. If you prefer a
vegetarian version, saute mushrooms and peppers instead of seafood
and add into tomato sauce. Grated parmesan is traditionally not
offered with seafood
dishes.
1. In a large skillet, heat olive oil on medium-high heat. Add
shallots and garlic. Saute for 1 minute or until softened slightly,
then add lemon rind, parsley, shrimps and scallops. Saute together
until shrimps just turn pink and scallops are translucent, about 1-2
minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon
from skillet. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add white wine to skillet, bring to boil and add mussels. Cover and
steam
mussels until they open, about 3 minutes. Remove mussels from skillet
and reserve with shrimps and scallops. Discard any mussels that do
not open. Remove mussel meats from half the mussels, leaving
remainder in their shells.
3. Meanwhile drain tomatoes and chop, reserving juice. Add tomatoes,
juice and chili flakes into skillet and bring to boil. Stir in 2TB
basil and simmer
for 10 minutes to combine flavours. Season with salt and pepper.
Sauce can be
made ahead to this point.
4. When ready to serve: bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add
pasta
and cook until al dente, about 10-12 minutes. Drain well.
5. Return seafood to sauce, sprinkle with remaining basil then
reheat. Toss with pasta and serve.
