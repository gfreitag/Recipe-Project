Title: Dutch West Indies Pindasus
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Caribbean
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
(see  pg 118)
2 tb (to 3 tbs) kejap manis
Or soy sauce
2 tb Distilled white vinegar
1/2 c  (to 1 cup) chicken stock
1/4 c  Onion(s), finely chopped
1    Garlic clove(s), minced
1 ts Sambal ulek *
3/4 c  Peanut butter
3 tb Tamarind Water *
(Indonesian-Style Peanut Sauce)

Place the onion, garlic, and sambal in a mortar and pestle and pound
to a smooth paste. Stir in the peanut butter, followed by the
remaining ingredients. Transfer the mixture to a heavy saucepan.

Place the pan over medium heat and gently simmer the sauce for 5 min
or until well flavored, adding more water as necessary to make a
thick but pourable sauce.

Transfer the sauce to a clear glass jar. Refrigerated, it will keep
for up to 4 weeks.

Traditionally served with pork and chicken satays, but it's also
delicious as a salad dressing or a dip for raw or steamed vegetables.

Note: Sambal ulek is a fiery paste made of red peppers. If
unavailable, substitute Vietnamese or Thai chili paste. Kejap manis
is a thick, sweet soy sauce. If unavailable, substitute equal parts
regular soy sauce and molasses. The recipe for Tamarind Water is on
pg 118. If unavailable, substitute balsamic vinegar. Look for these
ingredient in gourmet shops or Asian markets.
