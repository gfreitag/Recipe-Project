Recipe by: The Frugal Gourmet On Our Immigrant Ancestors
Cover the prunes with the water; bring to a boil. Turn off the heat,
add the apricots, and let cool. Drain and reserve the liquid. With a
sharp knife make slits the length of the pork loin. Rub the roast
with salt and pepper and insert 1/2 the cooked prunes and apricots in
the slits. Tie the meat up into a roast. Insert a meat thermometer.
Place the meat on a roasting rack in a pan and place 1 cup water in
the bottom of the pan. Additional water may have to be added to
prevent drying. Roast in a preheated 325 F oven for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4
hours. Remove the meat when the thermometer registers 155 F.
SAUCE:
Place all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a
simmer. Cook for 5 mins. Puree in a food blender until smooth. Return
the sauce to the pan. Bring to a simmer before serving. You may want
to thicken the sauce with 1 Tbs of cornstarch dissolved in 2 Tbs of
water, stirred into the sauce while simmering.
