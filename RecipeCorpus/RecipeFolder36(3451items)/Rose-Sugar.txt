Title: Rose Sugar
Categories: Condiments, Information
Yield: 9 ounces
1 ea Fragrant rose
1 c  Sugar
1.  Pour the sugar into a clean glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.
Bury the rose in the sugar and place the jar in full sunlight.  Shake
the jar every other day for 2 to 3 weeks

To use:  You can use this sugar in place of regular sugar in many
recipes - the sugar will seem a bit sweeter.  This sugar is
delightful sprinkled on fresh or brandied fruit.  Dust freshly made
chocolate or pound cake with the sugar through a fancy doily.

Variation:  If you would like to try a powdered rose (or vanilla)
sugar, simply place 1 cup of flavored sugar, without the blossom (or
beans) into your blender with 1 teaspoon ccornstarch and blend on
high speed for 2 minutes or until sugar is a fine powder.  Let the
mixture rest for a week or two before using to make sure the
cornstarch flavor is absorbed.
