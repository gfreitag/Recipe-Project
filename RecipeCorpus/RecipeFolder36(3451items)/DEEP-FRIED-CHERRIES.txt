"Fresh fruit coated with batter and deep fried is a favorite dessert
in several eastern European countries. Plums, apples or currants are
prepared in the same manner. In Hungary this dessert is called
Cseresznye Kisutve".
Wash cherries and wipe dry. Do not remove stems. Tie with thread to
form clusters of 4 cherries. Combine flour, sugar, milk, wine and
eggs in a bowl. Mix to make a smooth batter. Dip each cluster of
cherries into batter, coating well; and drop into a kettle of deep
hot fat (375F on frying thermometer). When golden, remove with a
slotted spoon and drain. Serve at once with confectioner's sugar and
cinnamon. SERVES:6
