Again, there are so many variations of corn-chile-cream dishes that
is is hard to know just which recipe to choose. For a change, the
chiles could be left whole, stuffed with corn and cheese, and cooked
in cream. But this combination is delicious any way.

This is a very rich dish, and is very good served as a separate course
with hot tortillas. It is best eaten right after it's cooked, as the
cheese gets tough when reheated.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Melt the butter and cook the onion and garlic, without browning, until
they are soft.

Cut the chiles into rajas (strips), add them to the pan, and cook
them, covered, 8 minutes.

Add the corn, heese, and salt to the chile mixture. Cover tightly with
foil or a lid and let it bake for 20 minutes for frozen corn. If you
use fresh corn, cook for 40 minutes, adding the cheese after the
first 20 minutes of cooking time.

Serve the vegetables hot, with the sour cream.
