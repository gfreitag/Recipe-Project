Deane and Brady in The Times Test Kitchen found that of all the
turkeys we tested this year, the Yucatan Turkey Pibil made the best
soup. Here's how it's done.
Place turkey bones and juices with water to cover in stock pot and
simmer over medium-low heat 1 1/2 hours. Strain stock.
Add shredded turkey, potatoes, carrots and rice. Simmer 30 to 45
minutes. Serve in soup bowls, garnish with cilantro and serve with
lime.
