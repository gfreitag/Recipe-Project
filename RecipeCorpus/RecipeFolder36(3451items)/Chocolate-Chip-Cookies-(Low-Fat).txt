Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 c  Regular rolled oats
1 pk (6 oz.) semisweet choc.
Baking chips
2 tb Granulated sugar
-(thereabouts)
2 tb Butter, softened
2 tb Canola oil
1 c  Firmly packed dark brown
Sugar
1 lg Egg
1/2 c  Applesauce
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Baking powder
In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter, oil, and brown
sugar until smooth. Add egg, applesauce, and vanilla; beat until
blended. Beat in baking powder, soda, and salt, then flour, until
smooth. Scrape side of bowl, then stir in oats and chocolate.

Bake dough right away; if allowed to sit, cookies will be dry. Drop
dough by 2-tablespoon portions onto 2 lightly oiled 12-by-15-inch
baking sheets, spacing evenly. Dip fingertips in granulated sugar,
then pat cookies into 1/3-inch-think rounds.

Bake in a 350~ oven until pale golden, about 10 minutes; switch pan
positions after 5 minutes. Lift to racks; eat warm or cool. Makes
about 25.
