Title: German Open Faced Sandwiches
Categories: Aust/german, Appetizers, Snacks, Sandwich
Yield: 1 text file  Most German restaurants and all cafes feature a group of light meals
known as Toasts and Belegtes Butterbrot: open faced sandwiches eaten
with a knife and fork.

The breads: French white, German Rye, Pumpernickel, crisp breads.
Sauteed on both sides [the "toast"] and drained with hot toppings OR
plain bread slices with cold toppings.

The butters: Flavored butters are generally used, not plain. Soften
butter, then mash and mix in one or more of: dill, parsley, other
green herbs, caraway seeds, hot or sweet mustard, anchovy paste,
pounded cooked crab, shrimp or lobster, sauteed and minced mushrooms,
mashed sardines, grated horseradish, grated cheese, mashed hard
cooked eggs, curry powder, lemon juice and rind, powdered walnuts or
almonds, brandy, garlic, chopped chives or minced onion.

The toppings: These sandwiches are generally served in pairs with two
different complimentary toppings. Some good combos are: ham or smoked
salmon with sliced hard cooked egg Chicken salad with asparagus tips
and mayo. Other good toppings are beef tartar with hard cooked eggs
and anchovies, wursts, cheeses, sardines with paper thin lemon
slices, sliced tongue, rare roast beef with horseradish, meat or fish
salads, caviar, goose liver pate, creamed mushrooms with ham,
Roquefort cheese and apples, ham and asparagus au gratin, scrambled
eggs with minced ham and chives, grilled ham and Swiss cheese with
pineapple, smoked oysters or mussels with lemon horseradish, a small
grilled steak. [A great way to utilize left over just about anything!]

The garnishes: Serve with a selection of gherkins, pickles, pickled
beets, raw vegetables, small salads, lemon slices etc. Lettuce is
sometimes a garnish or side but never a sandwich topping ingredient.
