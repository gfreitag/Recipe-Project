(For a nice crunchiness substitute '1/4 cup walnuts or water
chestnuts for celery.

For a more delicate texture try 1/4 cup currants and raisins; you'll
have a sweet sort of gravy on the bottom of the panQthis is my
favorite. Dish can also be made with bone-in turkey or chicken
breasts, but add about 10 minutes to baking time.) From the files of
