We have these potatoes every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They
are by far my favorite recipe for mashed potatoes.  You can make them
a couple of days in advance and keep them in the refrigerator, and
they also freeze very well - just stick them in the freezer after you
mix all the stuff together, and cook them in the oven according to
the directions after they are defrosted.

Cook and mash potatoes (mash the potatoes well).

Add cream cheese and butter.  Beat until melted.

Beat in sour cream.

Mix eggs, milk, and onion together.  Add to potatoes with salt and
pepper.  Beat until fluffy.

Cook in a 2 qt casserole at 350 deg. for 45 minutes.
