In a blender, combine corn, milk, egg substitute, chicken stock, and
celery; puree and add to a Dutch oven or stockpot. Cook over medium
heat, stirring often, until creamy. Remove from heat and let cool to
room temperature.

Strain soup stock into a deep bowl, pushing as much pulp as possible
through the sieve. Discard residue from inside of sieve, then scrape
pulp from the outside into the bowl.

Return stock to pot. Add cornmeal, white pepper, lime juice, orange
juice, and evaporated milk. Bring to a simmer and, stirring often,
cook for 15 min. Remove from stove and let cool.

Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Garnish with Cilantro
Salsa and serve.
