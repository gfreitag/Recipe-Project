Title: Orange Broiled or Grilled Whitefish
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Bbq/grill, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Orange juice
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 lb Whitefish fillet
1/2 c  Italian dressing
1/4 c  Water
Cut fish into serving-size pieces and lay in a shallow acid proof
dish. Combine marinade ingredients and pour mixture over the fish.
Cover and let stand to marinate about 1 hr, turning once. Remove
fish from marinade and place on oiled broiler pan. Broil 4 inches
from heat source for about 4 to 6 minutes, or until fish flakes
easily. Or grill on the barbecue.

The left over marinade can be used in part to brush on the fish as
it's cooking and the remainder can be heated and thickened with a
pinch of corn starch and served as a sauce at the table.

Garnish the platter with orange slices and serve.
