Chef Prudhomme writes, "When I was growing up in the country, we
picked greens fresh from our garden near the house.  If you don't
have a vegetable garden, purchase your greens as close to making
this dish as possible."

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
Place the creamy mixture ingredients in a blender and puree until
smooth and creamy; set aside.

Preheat a heavy 5-quart pot, preferably non-stick, over high heat
to 350 degrees F, about 4 minutes.

Add the onions, celery, and 2 tablespoons of the seasoning mix
and cook, checking the bottom of the pot occasionally for
sticking, until the vegetables start to brown, about 8 minutes.
Add the apple juice, clear the bottom of the pot of any brown
bits, then add the mushrooms and the remaining seasoning mix.
stir and cook until most of the liquid evaporates, about 7 to 8
minutes.  Add all the greens and 3 cups of the stock, stir and
cook for 6 minutes.

Add the pureed creamy mixture and stir well.  CAUTION: Dishes
using these creamy mixtures can "break" or curdle easily if they
are brought to a full boil.  Therefore, bring the liquid just to
a gentle boil, stir immediately, then reduce the heat to low and
simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.  Add the remaining
1/2 cup stock, stir, and add the fettucine.  Stir and cook until
the pasta is heated throughout, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Serve
immediately.
