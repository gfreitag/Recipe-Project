1/2    Red pepper sliced thinly
1/2    Orange pepper sliced thinly

1/2    Cruet of Jennie's FF good

-pieces
1 sm Sweet onion in half circles
1/2 c  Frozen peas
1/2 c  Frozen corn
1/2    Yellow squash, cut in
All measurements are approximate.

Cook macaroni al dente.  Boil the carrot for a very short time in
water just until it's slightly soft.  Do the same with the green
beans and yellow squash.  Defrost corn and peas or stick them in the
boiling water for a second.  Mix everything together in a big mixing
bowl and refrigerate a couple of hours, preferably overnight.

For dressing:
Buy *regular* Good Seasons dressing mix.  Use a half and half mixture
of vinegar and water.  Follow directions on the package to make it,
using interesting vinegars, and instead of adding oil, add a half and
half mixture of vinegar and water (preferably using a different
vinegar). Shake like crazy.
