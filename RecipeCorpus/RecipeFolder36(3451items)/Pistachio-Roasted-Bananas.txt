Title: Pistachio Roasted Bananas
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Cold whole milk
6    Whole bananas,
Just underripe
8 oz Shelled unsalted
Natural pistachio nuts
Or walnuts or pecans
MMMMM----------------------CLEAR LIME SAUCE---------------------------
Of 6 limes
1    Vanilla bean
Split lengthwise
1/2 c  Sugar
6 tb Water
Grated zest and juice
MMMMM------------------ORANGE-STRAWBERRY SAUCE-----------------------
1/4 c  Grand Marnier liqueur
1 pt Strawberries
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Soak the peeled nuts in the cold milk for 1 hour. Drain and dry on a
clean towel. Chop the nuts roughly and place in a large shallow dish.
Peel the bananas carefully to avoid breaking them. Gently press a
peeled banana into the nuts, turning to coat completely. Place on an
ungreased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bananas.

Bake the bananas for 10-12 min. Let cool, then carefully place on 6
individual plates. Serve with either Clear Lime Sauce or
Orange-Strawberry on the side.

Clear Lime Sauce:
Place all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.
Remove from the heat and let cool; the sauce will thicken as it cools.

Note: Leave the vanilla bean in the sauce until it is completely
finished; remove it before serving.

Makes 1/3 cup

Orange-Strawberry Sauce:
Place the strawberries in a mixing bowl and mash with a fork to a
puree. Stir in the liqueur and mix well.
