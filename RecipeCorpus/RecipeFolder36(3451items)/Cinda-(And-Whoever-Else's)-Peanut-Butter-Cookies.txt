Title: Cinda (And Whoever Else's) Peanut Butter Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 batch
1    Egg
1    Bag Hershey's kisses, opt'l
1 c  Peanut butter
1 c  White or (firmly packed)
Brown sugar
(the brown sugar version is best, IMHO)

Since you like peanut butter and chocolate, here's one for you that
shouldn't challenge your abilities too much.  The original recipe for
this came from my sister-in-law (the overworked mother of 5 boys) who
got it from a neighbor when she lived in Alaska.  Another version was
posted here a couple of years ago by someone (can't recall who), and
I've posted it several times since, but just in case you missed it....

Mix the peanut butter, sugar and egg together.  Roll into balls the
size of large marbles, place on a cookie sheet, and either flatten
with a fork or flatten by pressing a kiss in the center.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the edges just start to
brown.

NOTE:  This is NOT a misprint.  There is NO FLOUR or anything else in
this recipe, just the peanut butter, egg and sugar.  It seems as if
it would be a dreadful mess, but the result is a very good cookie.
