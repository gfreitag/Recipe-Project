In a small mixer bowl or food processor bowl combine cheeses; let stand to
soften.  Add basil or oregano, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot
pepper sauce; beat with an electric mixer on low speed, or cover and
process till well combined. (Mixture will be crumbly). Form into a ball.
Shape into a 4-1/2 inch round about 1 inch high. Wrap in clear plastic
wrap; chill several hours or overnight.

Unwrap cheese round; place in a 6 inch cast-iron skillet or heavy pan. Cut
into 6 wedges; separate wedges slightly.  Place skillet or pan on the rack
of a smoker or grill over slow coals.  Cover and smoke for 5 to 7 minutes
or til softened and heated through, checking often to make sure the cheese
doesn't overmelt. (The cheese shouldn't loose it's shape or start to run.)
Top each wedge with a pimiento slice and herb sprig, if desired. Serve with
warm vegetables and bread. Makes 6 appetizers.

*It is important to use process cheese.  Process cheese melts smoothly,
giving an acceptable texture.

**If you like, blanch or boil the vegetables ahead of time, cover and
chill.  Wrap in foil and reheat on grill while the cheese smokes.
