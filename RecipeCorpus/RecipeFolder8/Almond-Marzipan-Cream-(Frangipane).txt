Title: Almond Marzipan Cream (Frangipane)
Categories: Italian, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
4 oz (1/2 cup) sugar
6 oz (3/4 cup) ground almonds
3    Eggs
3 oz (3/4 cup) all purpose flour
2 c  Milk
You will need 2 bowls, a saucepan, and a baking dish.  Beat the eggs
together.  Mix the flour with a little of the milk, and then stir into the
rest of the milk and the beaten eggs.  Cook the mixture over low heat like
a custard, whisking steadily and adding the sugar and the almonds little by
little.  When thick, remove from the heat and pour into an oiled baking
dish.  When it is cold, cut into squares like Turkish delight.  Serve as a
special treat for holidays.
