To make lamb filling: In a small bowl, cover raisins with boiling
water and let steep for 5 minutes; drain and set aside.
Set a large nonstick skillet over low heat and add the pine nuts.
Cook, stirring, until well toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn out onto a plat to
cool. Chop pine nuts and reserve. Add oil to the skillet and heat over
medium heat. Add onions and garlic; saute until softened and beginning to
color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add lamb, cumin, cinnamon and all-spice; cook,
stirring, until the lamb is no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a
colander and drain off fat. Return the lamb mixture to the skillet and add
chicken stock, reserved raisins and pine nuts, parsley and lemon juice;
cook until liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute. Season with sal and pepper.
Let cool. (The lamb filling can be prepared ahead and refrigerated for up
to 2 days.)

To form phyllo triangles: Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to
350 degrees F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray ro
line with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whist together egg white, oil,
and salt.
Lay a sheet of phyllo on the work surface with short side toward you.
Cut lenghtwise into thirds. Brush the lenghtwise half of each strip lightly
with the egg-white mixture. Place a tablespoon of filling at the bottom of
the strip and fold one corner of the strip over the filling diagonally
across to the opposite edge to form a triangle. Continue to fold the
triangle onto itself, as you would fold a flag. Place on the prepeared
baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and
filling.
Brush the triangles lightly with the egg-white mixture and sprindle
with seeds, if desired. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until dar, golden.
Let cool for 5 minutes before serving hot. (The triangles may be baked up
to 2 days in advance, then reheated in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12
minutes, or until heated through.)
