"In 1966 a chocolate cake called the Tunnel of Fudge Cake, made with a
boxed frosting mix, won the Pillsbury BAKE-OFF Contest.  Although the
frosting mix was discontinued, Pillsbury continued to receive so many
requests for the cake that the company developed a scratch recipe to
simulate the original.  Here it is:"

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup bundt pan or 10" angel
food tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out excess. 2. In a large bowl, beat
together butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until
light and fluffly, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well
after each addition.  Gradually add 2 cups powdered sugar, beating until
well blended.  By hand, stir in flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, and nuts; mix until
well blended. Spoon batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. 3. Bake 58
to 62 minutes.  Since this cake has a soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary
doneness test cannot be used. Accurate oven temperature and baking time are
critical.  Let cake cool upright in pan on a rack for 1 hour; then invert
onto serving plate and let cool completely. 4. To make glaze, in a small
bowl, combine remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar, remaining 1/4 cup cocoa,
and milk.  Mix until well blended. Spoon glaze over top of cool cake,
allowing some to run down sides. Store cake tightly covered.

** Nuts are essential for the success of this recipe.
