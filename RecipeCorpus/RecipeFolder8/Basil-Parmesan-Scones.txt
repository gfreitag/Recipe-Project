Title: Basil-Parmesan Scones
Categories: Breads, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
Dash garlic & onion
Powder, black pepper
1    Recipe buttermilk bisquits
1/2 c  Parmesan
1 tb Basil
There's a bakery near me called Aunt Mary's (are you listening, Sallie?)
and they have the most wonderful basil-parmesan scones.  One day I
experimented and was pleased to find a pretty good facsimile.

Just add the above ingredients along with all the other dry ingredients and
proceed as above.  These are a nice change of pace from Italian or garlic
bread.  Or cut with smaller cutter and serve as appetizer (don't forget to
reduce baking time if smaller).
