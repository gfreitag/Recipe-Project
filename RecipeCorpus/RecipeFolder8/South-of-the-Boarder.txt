Title: South of the Boarder
Categories: Mexican, Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Chopped black olives
1    Hot pepper
8 oz Cream cheese
Directions: Prepare about 2 tsp. of the hot pepper by chopping it up.
Remember: the "heat" is in the seeds and membranes inside, so if you want
to keep it relatively mild remove all of that. Using an electric mixer,
blend all the ingredients. Smear the mess evenly on a flour tortilla and
roll it up. Chill in the refrigerator. To serve, cut the roll into little
log segments and serve with some mild salsa.
