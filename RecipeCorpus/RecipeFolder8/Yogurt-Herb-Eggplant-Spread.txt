Categories: Dips
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Chopped thyme leaves; -=OR=-
1 pn -Dried Thyme
Freshly ground pepper
1/2 c  Plain yogurt
1    Garlic clove; minced
1 ts Finely chopped oregano; -OR-
1/4 ts -Dried oregano
--------------------------------THE EGGPLANT--------------------------------
- or more to taste
Lemon juice
-=OR=- Red Wine Vinegar
Salt
Coarsely ground pepper
Fresh herbs for garnish
1/2 lb Japanese eggplants; -=OR=-
1 md -Firm shiny eggplant
1 lg Garlic clove; thinly sliced
1    Bay leaf
Thyme branches, if available
1 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
PREHEAT OVER TO 400F. Combine the first 5 ingredients in a bowl and set
aside. Cut 5-or-6 long slits in the eggplant (fewer if you're using
Japanese eggplants) and place a slice of garlic into each slit. Wrap the
eggplant, together with the bay leaf and thyme branches, tightly in foil
and bake until completely soft all over--45 minutes-to-1 1/2 hours,
depending on the size of the eggplant. If you're using the large eggplant,
turn it over after 45 minutes and continue baking until soft to the touch
and tender at the stem end. When done, remove eggplant from the oven, open
the package and let sit for 5 minutes or so. Discard any liquid. When the
eggplant is cool enough to handle, scrape the flesh away from the skin, put
it into a food processor and add the yogurt mixture and the olive oil.
Process until smooth, but leave a little texture. Stir in the lemon juice
or vinegar to taste and season with salt. Turn the puree into a serving
bowl and season with pepper and fresh herbs, such as thyme leaves and
blossoms, marjoram or oregano. If those herbs aren't available, use some
chopped parsley or scallions. Serve the spread at room temperature with
crackers, pita bread or bread toasted and brushed with olive oil.
