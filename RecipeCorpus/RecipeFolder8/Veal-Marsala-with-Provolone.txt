Title: Veal Marsala with Provolone
Categories: Meats, Italian, Veal
Yield: 4 servings
4    Mushrooms, fresh, sliced
1/2 c  Marsala wine
4 tb Butter, cold
Provolone cheese, sliced
2 lb Veal cutlets
Flour
Salt & pepper
2 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
Pound veal cutlets between sheets of waxed paper til about 1/4" thick.
Combine flour and salt & papper to taste.  Dredge cutlets in the flour
mixture.  Combine 2 Tbsp butter with the 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large frying
pan over medium high heat.  Cook cutlets until lightly browned- about 2-3
minutes per side.  Remove cutlets to a platter or pan suitable for use
under a broiler.  Place sliced mushrooms in the frying pan and cook until
tender, adding a little butter if needed. Add Marsala and reduce sauce to
about half of the original volume. Pre-heat broiler. Lower heat under the
frying pan to VERY low, or place pan in a larger pan of hot water. Whisk in
cold butter, 1 Tbsp at a time, adding each just before the last is
completely incorporated. Remove sauce from heat immediately when done.
Place a slice of provolone on each cutlet and broil until cheese bubbles
and just starts to brown. Serve sauce alongside the cutlets, or spoon over
as they are served.  (This type of sauce will separate if it becomes too
hot at any point- mine always does :) ).

Other ideas:  Use chicken in place of veal.  Place a slice of prosciutto on
the chicken or veal, then the slice of cheese before broiling.
