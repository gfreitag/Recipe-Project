Title: Five Pound Fudge
Categories: Candies, Chocolate
Yield: 6 servings
12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate chips
12 oz Milk chocolate bar
2 c  Chopped pecans or walnuts
2 ts Vanilla
4 1/2 c  Sugar
12 oz Can evaporated milk
1/4 lb Butter
1    Jar marshmallow creme
Cook sugar, milk, and butter to soft ball stage (234 degrees on candy
thermometer), stirring constantly.  Take off the heat and add the remaining
ingredients.  Stir quickly and thoroughly to blend.  Pour into a large
baking pan or dish (I lightly butter it first).  Cool. Cut into squares and
store in refrigerator.

My favorite fudge recipe!!  I prefer it with walnuts instead of pecans and
I even buy my milk chocolate candy bars with almonds sometimes for a little
added flavor and crunch!
