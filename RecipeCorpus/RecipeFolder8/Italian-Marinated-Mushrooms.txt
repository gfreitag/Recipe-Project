In propitiation, may I offer Italian Marinated Mushrooms (not too original,
I'm still fighting off the cobbies to locate Grandma's secret kitchen
diary):

Paprika Parsley sprigs Bread sticks (optional)

Cut mushrooms into 1/8-inch slices.  Mix mushroom slices and lemon juice in
large bowl (glass or plastic).  Stir in oil, onions, 1/4 cup parsley, the
garlic, slat, and pepper.  Toss; cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours,
stirring occasionally.

Just before serving, remove from mixing bowl to serving bowl, using slotted
spoon.  Sprinkle with paprika.  Garnish with parsley sprigs.  Serve with
long, thin bread sticks if desired.
