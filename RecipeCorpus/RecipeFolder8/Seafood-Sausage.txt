Title: Seafood Sausage
Categories: Fish/sea, Appetizers, Sausages
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 c  Egg whites
4    Feet sausage casings
1/2 lb Whitefish, skinned, boned
1/4 lb Salmon, skinned and boned
1/4 lb Shrimps, peeled
2 tb Finely minced onion
1 bn Parsley; stems removed
CUT THE FISH IN 1-INCH PIECES. Place all ingredients except casings in a
food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Or, pass all the
ingredients through a meat grinder fitted with medium holes. Stuff the
mixture into sausage casings or form 2 long sausages in plastic wrap. Poach
the sausages in gently simmering water for 5 minutes, drain and let cool.
If you have used plastic wrap to form the sausages, remove it when sausages
are cool. Cut sausages into 6-inch lengths. To serve, grill the sausages or
place under a preheated broiler. Since the sausages are already cooked, we
want only to reheat them and crisp their skins.

Makes 8 Sausages, or 4 Servings
