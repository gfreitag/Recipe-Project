and the centerpiece of the party, too."

drained and cut into quarters Garlic bread for serving

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut a hole about 5 inches in diameter in the
top of the bread. (If you wish, make a decorative zigzag pattern.) Reserve
crusty part to make top for loaf. Scoop out most of the soft inside portion
of the loaf and save for another purpose, such as stuffing or bread crumbs.
In a skillet, saute' the scallions and garlic in the butter until scallions
wilt. Do not burn! Place the cream cheese in a medium sized bowl; add the
scallions, garlic, sour cream, and Cheddar cheese. Mix well. Fold in the
artichoke hearts. Fill hollowed-out bread with this mixture. Replace top of
bread and wrap in a double thickness of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Bake for
about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours. Remove foil and top of bread and serve, using
thin slices of warm garlic bread as dippers.

Note: The best part of this dish is when the dip is gone and all you have
left is the breadd, which is soaked in all those delicious ingredients.
Just break the bread up and pass it around!
