*DIRECTIONS*

Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, tossing lightly with a
spoon to mix.  Combine the mayonnaise, coffee, and vanilla in a smaller
bowl; add to the dry ingredients, beating with the mixer on medium for
three minutes.

Generously grease a baking pan, then dust with cocoa.  Bake at 350 F. For a
layer cake, bake 20 minutes; for a sheet cake, bake 25 minutes; for a bundt
cake, bake 45 minutes.  If it falls, don't throw it out---it masquerades as
wonderful brownies.
