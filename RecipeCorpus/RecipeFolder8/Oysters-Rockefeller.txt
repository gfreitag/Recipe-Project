reserving the oyster liquor.

3.   Pick over spinach and remove any tough stems and blemished leaves.
Rince  well  and put in a saucepan.  Cover  and  cook, stirring, until
spinach is wilted. Cook briefly and drain well. Squeeze to remove excess
moisture.  Blend or put through a food mill. There should be about 2 cups.

4. Put the scallions, celery, and parsley into the container of an electric
blender and blend.  There should be about  1  cup finely blended.

5.  Chop the anchovies and garlic together finely.

6.   Heat  4  tablespoons of butter in a skillet  and  add  the scallion
and celery mixture.  Stir about 1 minute and add  the anchovie mixture.
Cook,  stirring, about 1 minute, and add the spinach. Stir to blend.

7.   Heat  remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan  and add the
flour.  Blend,  stirring with a wire whisk,  and  add oyster liquor,
stirring vigorously with the whisk. Stir in the cream. Season with Tobasco
to taste.  DO NOT ADD SALT. Add the spinach mixture and Pernod. Let cool.

8.   Spoon equal portions of the mixture on top of the  oysters and smooth
over the tops.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake about 25 minutes or
until piping hot.

Note:  The same spinach topping is equally as good, (some think better),
with clams on the half-shell. (Clams Rockefeller)
