CHOCOLATE MINT MIDDLES

Trader Joe's chocolate mint UFOs, or similar chocolate wafers 1 egg

Melt butter in microwave, stir it, make sure it's not too hot. Stir in egg
thoroughly, add to cake mix, stir up into a cookie dough. All dry
ingredients should be moistened.

At this point you can use it or wrap it airtight and store in fridge up to
a couple of weeks.

Scoop about a heaping teaspoon full and mould it around a chocolate mint
wafer.  If you have a gem pan (shallow muffin tin), put them into the
depressions.  Bake at 350 degrees, check after 9 minutes. ("Cook at
moderate heat until done.")

Cool completely in pan, remove with plastic fork.  Will make more than 4
dozen.  --Jocelyn "Mom" Baden, Costa Mesa CA

[I haven't tried this yet myself; when I went down to TJ's they were out of
the chocolate mint UFOs, and we don't keep cake mix in the house. Mom
vouches for it as a great treat to keep on hand for cooking in the
toaster-oven; the gem pan holds 6 cookies and fits neatly on the rack.]

["Similar chocolate wafers" should be about the same size as a Hersheys
Kiss, but flatter.]
