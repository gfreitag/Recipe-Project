Title: Tulip, Crab, and Asparagus Appetizers
Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea
Yield: 25 servings
1 ds Pepper or cayenne
1 c  Crab meat, flaked
25    Fresh asparagus spears
25    Tulip petals
3 oz Cream cheese; softened
2 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Minced chives
1 ts Minced fresh dill or mint
-(Optional)
In a medium bowl, beat cheese with lemon juice, herbs, and pepper; stir in
crab.

Break tough ends off asparagus.  Blanch in 1 inch of boiling water in a
large skillet with a lid, or steam standing upright in a couple of inches
of water in a tall, narrow pot, until crisp-tender, 2 to 5 minutes,
depending on thickness of stems.  Plunge into an ice-water bath for 1
minute; then pat dry.  Trim asparagus to abut 5 inches; from the trimmings,
cut as many 1/4-inch rounds as you have tulip petals.  Save extra ends for
salads.

Fill each tulip petal with about 1/2 a rounded teaspoon of crab mixture and
garnish with an asparagus round.  (If your petals are large and asparagus
thin, you can use 3 rounds to garnish each filled petal.) Arrange asparagus
in a fan on a serving platter and place tulip petals alternately (or create
your own pattern).
