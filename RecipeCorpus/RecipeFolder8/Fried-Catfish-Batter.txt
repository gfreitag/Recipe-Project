Catfish (Steaks, fillets or whole) Oil for frying.

Heat oil until it pops when sprinkled with a drop of water.  Pat fish dry,
then brush with mustard, (mixed with sherry or brandy if desired). Sift
cornmeal, salt and pepper into bag.  Add 2 or 3 steaks or fillets, or 1
whole fish; close and shake.  Drop fish carefully into hot oil; fry until
lightly browned.  Drain well on paper.  Keep fish warm and crisp in a
closed paper sack.

Try fresh or canned potatoes fried with the same batter.  Tastes good.
