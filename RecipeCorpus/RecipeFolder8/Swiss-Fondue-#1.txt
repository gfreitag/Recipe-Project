Title: Swiss Fondue #1
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Appetizers, Swedish
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Kirsch (Or More)
Nutmeg To Taste, Grated
2    French Bread, In 1" Cubes
1/2    Garlic Clove
1 2/3 c  Dry White Wine
1 lb Gruyere Cheese, Grated
2 ts Cornstarch
Rub the inside of a heavy saucepan with the garlic, add the wine and heat
it over mod-low heat until it is hot.  Add the cheese by handfuls,
stirring. Cook the mixture, stirring, until smooth, keeping it just below
simmering point. In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup
kirsch. Mix well and add to the Gruyere mixture with nutmeg and pepper to
taste. Heat, stirring constantly, just until it begins to bubble. Do not
let it boil. Transfer to a heated fondue pot and keep it hot over a low
flame.  If fondue becomes too thick, add some additional kirsch to thin.
Spear bread cubes with long fondue forks and dip them into the cheese. a
