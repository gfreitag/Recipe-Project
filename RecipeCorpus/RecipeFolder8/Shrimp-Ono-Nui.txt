Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 c  Shredded coconut

This Hawaiian-style shrimp dish came from the Safari Steakhouse restaurant
in the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu.  The shrimp are heavily coated
with shredded coconut before being deep-fried and served with a pineapple
cocktail sauce.  Ono nui means "very good" in Hawaiian and this dish
definitely lives up to its name.

Roll the shrimp in flour seasoned with salt, then dip in the beaten egg.
Roll the shrimp in the coconut, covering thoroughly.  Deep-fry the shrimp
in oil heated to about 350 degrees until browned and cooked through, about
3 to 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Mix the cocktail sauce with the
crushed pineapple.  Serve the shrimp with the sauce on the side.
