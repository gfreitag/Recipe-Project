zucchini in the margarine for about 4 to 5 minutes or until almost tender.
In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, chile powder, salt and pepper with a fork.
Stir in half of the cheese.  Pour the egg mixture over the zucchini in the

the bottom and sides of the skillet. Lift and fold the eggs with a spatula
