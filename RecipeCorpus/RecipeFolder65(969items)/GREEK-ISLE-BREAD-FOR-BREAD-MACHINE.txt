Unique is the word for this loaf.  Don't let the combination of
ingredients scare you off -- the texture created by the feta cheese
combined with the smallest hint of cucumber makes this a wonderful
bread. This is definitely a bread to accompany a hot meal. It's
recommended with char-grilled marinated lamb chops or your favorite
lamb kabobs. SUCCESS HINTS: Cucumber should be peeled, seeded, and
then pureed. If the feta cheese is packed in water, drain well.
Finely chop the black olives. This recipe can be made with the
regular and rapid-bake cycles. CALORIES: 142 PROTEIN: 14%
