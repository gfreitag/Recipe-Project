Title: GRILLED MELON WITH CUCUMBER
Categories: Appetizers, Vegan
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2    Round melon
1/4    Cucumber, peeled
1 tb Fresh summer herbs
-(finely chopped)
2 tb Brown sugar
A summery starter. Light and herby, this can be served either hot or
cold. In the latter case the sugar will crystallize and harden,
forming a coat over the fruit.

Scoop out the melon flesh with a 'baller'. Dice the cucumber into
similar-sized pieces. Mix the herbs with the two fruits inside the
melon shell. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the top, and leave under a
hot grill until the sugar melts.
