Don't let the colour fool you, a green curry can be devastatingly hot
if prepared the traditional way. For less heat, discard the chilli
seeds.

Remove the stems and roughly chop the chillies.  Put into an electric
blender with all of the other ingredients and blend to a smooth
paste. Add a Tbls of extra oil or a little water, if necessary, to
facilitate blending and store as you would the red curry paste.
