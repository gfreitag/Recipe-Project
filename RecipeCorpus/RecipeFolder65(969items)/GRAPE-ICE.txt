Title: GRAPE ICE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 c  Water
3/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Lemon juice
12 oz Frozen grape juice
-concentrate
Combine water and sugar in a large saucepan; cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Add remaining ingredients,
stirring until grape juice melts.

Pour mixture into freezer trays; freeze until firm, stirring several
times during freezing process. Yield: 5-1/2 cups.

(While the recipe does not offer the option, I would think that one
could use an ice cream freezer, following the manufacturer's
directions.)
