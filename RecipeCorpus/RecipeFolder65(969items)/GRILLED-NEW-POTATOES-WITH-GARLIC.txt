Cook potatoes on stove top in water to cover or in microwave oven on
HIGH (l00T power) until almost tender. Drain potatoes. Toss with
garlic, rose- mary and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Can be prepared day ahead to this point and refrigerated. To
grill, divide potatoes in half. Place each batch in single layer be-
tween large pieces heavy duty foil (or double thickness regular
foil). Bring up ends of foil to close airtight. Puncture several
holes in each packages. Place on grill rack over hot coals, turning
several times, until cooked, about 7 minutes total. Unwrap and serve
immediately. Makes 6 serv- ings. Puncturing the foil with holes
allows some ot the smokiness to permeate the potatoes.
