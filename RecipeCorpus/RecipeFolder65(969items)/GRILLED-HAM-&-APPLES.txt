Combine first 3 ingredients in a 1-cup glass measuring cup; microwave
at HIGH 1 minute or until melted, stirring once.

Cook ham and apples, covered with grill lid, over medium-hot coals
(350"= to 400"), turning occasionally and basting with marmalade
mixture, 20 minutes or until thoroughly heated.

Thanks to packaged ham slices, you can satisfy a craving without
buying= the whole hog. Pan fry, bake, or grill these 1/2-inch pieces
for a weeknight change of pace. Grab a slice or two on your way home
and ham it up with these fast flavor options.
