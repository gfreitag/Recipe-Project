Title: GREEK BISCUITS
Categories: Greek, Breads, Appetizers
Yield: 5 Servings
5 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
2 tb Each chopped fresh dill and
-scallion (green onion)
6    Pimento-stuffed green
-olives, chopped
1 tb Lemon juice
10 oz Package ready-to-bake
-refrigerated buttermilk
-flaky biscuits,
(10 biscuits) *

Preheat oven to 400F.  In small serving bowl, combine all ingredients
except biscuits; set aside.

Spray ten 2-inch diameter muffin pan cups with nonstick cooking spray.
Separate each biscuit into 2 thin layers of dough and arrange 1 layer
in bottom of each sprayed cup, reserving remaining layers. Arrange
1/10 of cheese mixture over each biscuit in cup, then top each with
remaining biscuit layer; press around edge of each biscuit to seal.
Partially fill remaining cups with water (this will prevent pan from
burning and/or warping).  Bake until biscuits are golden brown, 8 to
10 minutes.

Remove pan from oven and carefully drain off water. Remove biscuits
to wire rack and let cool. Makes 5 servings

* Keep biscuits refrigerated until ready to use. Separate dough into
layers as soon as biscuits are removed from refrigerator; they will
be difficult to work with if allowed to come to room temperature.
