Title: GRATIN OF POTATOES & CHEESE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
2    Lg. Cloves Garlic *
Salt & Pepper To Taste
2 pt Whipping Cream
4    Lg. Idaho Potatoes **
2 c  Grated Gruyere Cheese
*    Garlic cloves should be peeled and split. ** Potatoes should be
peeled and sliced paper-thin. (Slice at the last minute so that they
do not darken; do not soak in cold water). Preheat the oven to 325
degrees F. Rub the bottom and sides of a gratin dish with the cut
sides of the garlic. Leave the garlic in the dish. Cover with a layer
of potatoes. Sprinkle with some salt and freshly ground pepper and
cheese. Pour some cream over the whole thing. Repeat until all the
potatoes, cream, and cheese are used. Place the pan, uncovered in the
oven. (Put a baking sheet underneath to catch spills.) Bake for 1
hour or more, until the top is browned and the cream has cooked down
to a thick sauce. During the first 1/2 hour of cooking, use a broad
spatula to push the top layers of potatoes into the cream every once
in a while. Serve hot, at room temerature or cold.
