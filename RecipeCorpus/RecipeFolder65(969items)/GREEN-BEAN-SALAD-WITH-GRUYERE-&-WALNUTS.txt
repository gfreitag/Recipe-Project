Title: GREEN BEAN SALAD WITH GRUYERE & WALNUTS
Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Green beans
1/4 c  Oil-and-vinegar dressing,
Either bottled or home-made
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1 tb Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
1/4 lb Gruyere cheese, finely diced
1/8 ts Salt

To taste
1. Bring a pan of water to the boil.  Snap the ends from the beans.
Cut in halves or thirds if very long. Add to the boiling water and
time 5 to 7 minutes, or until the beans are tender. Drain in a
colander and rinse with cold water until cool.  Wrap in paper towels
and a plastic bag; refrigerate.  (This can be done 24 hours in
advance.)

2. Whisk together the dressing, cumin and mustard. Refrigerate if not
using right away.  About 1 hour before serving the salad, combine the
dressing with the beans, walnuts, Gruyere, salt and pepper. Mix
gently. Let marinate at room temperature 1 hour before serving.
