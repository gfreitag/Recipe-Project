Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 ts Fresh parsley; chopped
1 tb Garlic; finely chopped
1 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Olive oil
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 sm Jalapeno chile; seed/mince
1 lb Squid; cleaned/in 1" rounds
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 tb Garlic; finely chopped
1 tb Fresh rosemary; fine chop
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Clam juice
1 tb Lobster base;*
2 tb Whipped butter
* Lobster base is a glaze sold in gourmet food shops and some
supermarkets

1. Prepare marinade: Thoroughly whisk together all marinade
ingredients in a glass or stainless-steel bowl. Add squid pieces and
marinate at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally.

2. To make sauce: About 15 minutes before serving time, combine
garlic, rosemary, wine, clam juice and lobster base in a non-aluminum
saucepan. Bring to a gently simmer over medium heat, then simmer for
4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter. Keep warm.

3. Remove squid from marinade, draining well. Grill for 4 to 6
minutes, turning as needed, until just firm. (An open grill or a
well-heated, ridged grill pan may be used. You may need to use a
grill basket to hold the squid pieces if the spaces on your grill are
too wide to hold them.)

4. Shake saucepan to recombine sauce if necessary, then add cooked
squid. Raise heat to high and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat all
pieces well.

5. Serve with an extra dab of sauce.
