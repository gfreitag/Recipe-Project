Title: GREAT SHRIMP SCAMPI'
Categories: Fish/shellf, Italian
Yield: 1 Servings
Shrimp; large
Parsley
Salt
Garlic
Olive oil
Peel large shrimp and marinate, for 1 hour, in olive oil, garlic,
salt, and parsley.  Try a pinch or two of chili powder. Quickly
pan-fry. I use an Electric Wok at 350 degrees, I use lots of garlic,
and I use Garlic salt in- stead of regular salt. I add cooked
linguine or pasta (al dente), toss well to  coat the pasta and
sprinkle with a little more parsley and serve. It's fast and very
easy and really delicious. Please let me know if you try it and if
you like it or not!!! Bunny Cherish Kaplan (gkfm11a)
