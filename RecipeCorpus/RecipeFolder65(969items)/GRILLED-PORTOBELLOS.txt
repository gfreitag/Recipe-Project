Title: GRILLED PORTOBELLOS
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lg (to 4) portobello mushrooms
1 c  Olive oil
1 c  Red or white wine vinegar
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Fresh herbs, finely chopped
1 tb Dried savory
Cut the stems from the caps of the mushrooms. Slice each stem in half
lengthwise.

Combine the olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and herbs in a bowl
and blend well with a whisk. Let the marinade sit for 30 min if fresh
herbs are used, or for 1 hour until the dried herbs soften.

Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the broiler.

Place the mushroom caps and sliced stems in a shallow dish and pour
the marinade over. Let marinate for up to 10 min, turning
occasionally to ensure uniform coating.

Remove the mushrooms from the marinade and place them on the hot
grill or in the broiler. Grill on each side for about 2 min. Remove
from the grill, slice caps, and serve immediately.
