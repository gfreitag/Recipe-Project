Raspberries, a member of the rose family, impart a delicious aroma and
spark of flavor to this creative sauce. It is especially good with
roast duckling. COMBINE WINE, BROTH, preserves and giblets in a
saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat on the stove. Cook
until liquid is reduced by about 1/2. Add the cream and continue to
cook until liquid reduces enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove
from heat and whisk in the butter. Strain the sauce into a sauceboat
and discard the giblets. Stir in the peppercorns and serve the sauce
with the roasted bird. Makes 1 1/2 Cups ~--
