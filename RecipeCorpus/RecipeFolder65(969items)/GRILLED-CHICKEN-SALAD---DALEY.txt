Categories: Salads, Cheese, Low-fat/low, Garlic
Yield: 4 Servings
5 tb Lemon juice
3 tb Soy sauce
2    Cloves garlic -- peeled and
Chopped
1/8 ts Black pepper -- ground
1 ts Basil
8 oz Chicken breast halves
Without skin
1    Red onion -- trimmed and
Sliced
Light vegetable cooking oil
1 lb Mixed salad greens -- = 6
Cups
1 tb Blue cheese -- crumbled
1 md Tomatoes -- cored and
Wedged
4 tb Lemon juice
4 tb Balsamic vinegar
2    Cloves garlic -- peeled
2 ts Basil
Whisk together thoroughly the lemon juice, soy sauce, garlic, black
pepper, and basil in a large bowl and set aside.

Place the chicken on a sheet of plastic wrap spread on a work surface
and cover it with a second sheet. Pound gently with a mallet. Lift
the top sheet of plastic, flip the pieces of chicken over and
re-cover. Evenly pound the second side to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
Transfer the chicken to the marinade bowl and cover.  Marinate in the
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the grill or broiler.

Place the onion rounds in a single layer on a baking sheet and spray
lightly with the vegetable oil, turn them over and spray to coat the
other side. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place alongside
the onion rings. Grill or broil the onion rounds and the chicken for
5 minutes per side. Let the chicken cool a bit, then slice thinly.

Spread an even amount of the mixed greens on 4 salad plates, scatter
the onion rounds and then the sliced chicken on top. Sprinkle 3/4
teaspoon blue cheese over each.  Garnish with the tomato wedges.
Combine the dressing ingredients (lemon juice, vinegar, garlic and
basil) in a blender and mix at low speed until the garlic is finely
chopped. Spoon dressing onto the salads or serve it on the side.
