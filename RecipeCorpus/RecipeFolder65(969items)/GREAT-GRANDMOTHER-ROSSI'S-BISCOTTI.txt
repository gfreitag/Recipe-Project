Title: GREAT-GRANDMOTHER ROSSI'S BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Butter
2 c  Sugar
6    Eggs
1 tb Anise extract
1 c  Ground almonds
1 ts Salt
1 tb (plus 1 tsp) baking powder
4 c  (plus 2 Tb) flour
1.  Cream butter with sugar; add eggs one at a time and beat after
each
addition.  Add anise, then nuts and dry ingredients. Spread in
horseshoe shape on 2 buttered and floured cookie sheets. 2. Bake
at 350F for 15-18 minutes.  When set enough to cut, cut in
one-inch pieces and lay each on its side. Continue baking at 225F
or 250F for about two hours, or until the biscotti are as hard as
you like them.  These are foolproof and keep for weeks in a jar.
Great for dunking in coffee or milk.
