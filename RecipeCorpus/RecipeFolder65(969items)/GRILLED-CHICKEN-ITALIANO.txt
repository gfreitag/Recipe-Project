Title: GRILLED CHICKEN ITALIANO
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 1/2 lb Chicken, cut-up
1 c  Italian dressing
-(I use Kraft free Italian)
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1/4 ts Garlic powder
Rinse chicken with cold water and pat dry.  Arrange chicken pieces in
a glass baking dish.  In a med. bowl, combine salad dressing with
wine and garlick and pour over chicken. Cover and marinate 2 to 4
hours at room temperature, or overnight refrigerated. Remove chicken
from marinade and place on oiled grill set 4 to 6 inches over coals.
Grill chicken pieces, turning frequently and brushing with reserved
marinade, until browned outside and cooked through, with no trace of
pink near bone, about 35 to 40 minutes.
