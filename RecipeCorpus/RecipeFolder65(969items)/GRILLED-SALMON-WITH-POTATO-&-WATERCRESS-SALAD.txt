Title: GRILLED SALMON WITH POTATO & WATERCRESS SALAD
Categories: Grill, Low fat, Fish, Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Small red thin-skinned
Potatoes
1 c  Thinly sliced red onion
1 c  Seasoned rice vinegar
About 1/2 pound watercress
Rinsed and crisped
1    Salmon fillet, about 2 lbs.
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
2 c  Alder or mesquite wood chips
Soaked in water
Salt
In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high
heat; add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes
are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and chill.

Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover. Drain and mix
onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of
the course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other
uses). Mix chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad
alongside; cover and keep cool.

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
foil. Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish. Mix soy sauce
with brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.

Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame. Cover barbecue
(open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in
thickest part (cut to test), 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer fish to
platter with salad. Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.
