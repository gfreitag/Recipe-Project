Title: GREEN BEAN CURRY
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-================
-(aka Country Curry or
-Jungle Curry)
Ingredients:

1 lb  fresh green beans [if necessary, you may substitute whole frozen
ones] 2 T Thai Curry Paste (I like to use the "Key" brand packets of
either "Country Curry" or "Red Curry"; but they are all flavorful.
Mae Ploy and Tommy Tang are other good brands. 2 T vegetable oil
Bamboo shoots (optional; I like to use a large can of bamboo tips
because they are tender and I can cut them into 1/4 inch thick round
slices. You can also use a couple of the small cans of sliced bamboo
shoots, but they will not absorb the flavor as well. I think carrots
cut into coins would also be good, if you like those. I tried
potatoes once, but they just disintegrated.) 6 c chicken broth Clean
and pick green bean tips. In a dutch oven (or equivalent size
vessel), heat oil.  Add curry paste and "fry" until fragrant, about 1
minute.  Add broth, green beans, bamboo shoots (or other vegetable).
Bring to a rapid boil and cook like that for about 15-20 minutes
(watching that liquid doesn't reduce too much; add water as
necessary). Reduce heat to a hard simmer and continue cooking until
green beans are VERY done and have absorbed the flavor of the curry
broth. Serve in bowls over rice.
