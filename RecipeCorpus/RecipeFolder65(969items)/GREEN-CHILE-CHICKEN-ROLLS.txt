Title: GREEN CHILE CHICKEN ROLLS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Boneless skinless chicken
Breast halves
4    Egg roll skins
2    Egg white
4 oz Green chile -- chopped
1 c  Cheddar cheese, lowfat
Salt to taste
2 tb Picante sauce
Cut chicken breast in long strips and brown in skillet sprayed with
non-stick cooking spray. ( I boiled mine, and used chicken breast
tenders from Sam's; seasoned the boiling water with garlic powder and
seasoning salt.)  Dip one side of the egg roll wrapper in egg while.
The dipped side will be the outside of the roll. Place about 3-4
strips of chicken just below center on the wrapper. ( I use 2
boneless chicken tenderloins; seasoning which mesquite or grill
seasoning). Sprinkle on about 1-2 tablespoon of green chilies. Don't
use the mild. Top with 1/4 cup of chredded cheese.(Healthy Choice).
Roll up egg roll. Place rolls on baking sheet sprayed with non-stick
booking spray and bake in 350 degree oven for 20-25 minutes or until
Golden Brown. Top with a little picante sauce. Delmonte's hot and
spicy is good. Source: Fatfree and Ultralowfat Recipes by Doris Cross.
