Title: GRILLED FAJITAS
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Skirt (or flank) steak
1    Bell pepper
Flour tortillas
Shredded cheese
4    Limes
1    Onion
Pico de Gallo
Guacamole
* Marinate the steak in the lime juice overnight . Lemon will do but
the
taste is not the same. * Prepare a hot fire. * Chicken breast will
also work with this recipe.

Julienne the bell pepper. Trim the onion top and bottom. Slice the
onion from pole to pole so that each piece is about 2" long. It makes
it better to pack it in the tortillas. Place the steak on the grill
directly over the hottest part of the fire. Turn after about 5
minutes and grill until done (about another 5 minutes.) Remove the
steak, slice it across the grain about 1/4" thick and wrap in foil to
keep warm. Place a quadriple layer thick aluminum foil on the grill
with a little olive oil. Grill the vegetables quickly. To make it
authenic, place a cast iron skillet on the grill first and when the
vegetables are done, carefully place it all in the skillet and
carefully serve on a heavy trivet.

To Serve: take a warm tortilla and place a small amount of meat,
vegetables, and any or all of the other listed ingredients. Carefully
fold and try not the drop any on your shirt. Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK
