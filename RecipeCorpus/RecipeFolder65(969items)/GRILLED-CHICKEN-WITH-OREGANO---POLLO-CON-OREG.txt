Categories: Mexican, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
Jim Vorheis
2    1/2 lb large chicken pieces,
-with the skin attached
2    Garlic cloves, peeled
1 sm White onion, roughly sliced
1 c  Reduced chicken broth
12    Additional garlic cloves,
-peeled and minced
3 tb Dried Oaxacan or Mexican
-oregano, stems removed
And roughly crumbled
2 tb Additional chicken broth
1/2 ts Sea salt (or to taste)
Melted chicken fat or
-oil for broiling
Put the chicken pieces into a saute pan in one layer. Add the whole
garlic cloves, onion, and 1 cup chicken broth and cook, covered, over
medium heat, turning the pieces over from time to time, until the
broth has completely reduced and the chicken is tender - about
25    minutes.

Crush the minced garlic into a mortar with the oregano, 2 tablespoons
broth, and salt and work to a rough paste (or put it all into a
blender jar and blend very briefly). Spread the paste over the
chicken pieces, turning them so they ar evenly covered; return to the
pan and cover. Set aside to season for 2 hours. Heat a broiler or
grill and brown lightly, brushing with a little melted chicken fat if
necessary.
