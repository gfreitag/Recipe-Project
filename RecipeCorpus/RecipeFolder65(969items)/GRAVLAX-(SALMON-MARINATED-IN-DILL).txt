Title: GRAVLAX (SALMON MARINATED IN DILL)
Categories: Swedish, Seafood, Appetizers, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Fresh salmon fillet; center
-cut, cleaned & scaled
1 lg Bunch Dill; fresh, whole
1/4 c  Kosher salt (coarse, or
-regular is necessary)
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb White peppercorns (or black)
-crushed
Cut the salmon in half lengthwise and remove the backbone and the
small, freebones, as well, or ask your fish delaer to do it for you.
Leave the skin on. Place half of the fish, skin side down, in a deep
glass, enamel or stainless steel baking dish or casserle. Wash and
then shake dry the bunch of dill and place it on the fish. (If the
fill is of the hothouse variety and not very pungent, chop the herb
coarsely to release it's flavor and sprinkle it over the fish
instead.) In a separate bowl, combine the salt, sugar and crushed
peppercorns. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the dill. Top with the
other half of the fish, skin side up. Cover with foil and set a heavy
plate or platter on top of it, slightly larger than the salmon. Weigh
it down with cans or jars and refrigerate for at least 3 days, up to
7 days. Turn the fish over every 12 hours or so, basting with the
liquid marinade that accumulates, separating the halves a little to
baste the salmon inside. Replace the platter and weights each time.
When the gravlax is finished, remove the fish from it's marinade and
scrape away the dill and seasonings. Pat dry with paper towels. Or
leave the dill and seasonings in place. Place the separated halves
skin side down on a carving board and slice the salmon thinly on the
diagonal, detaching each slice from the skin. Gravlax is served as
part of a smorgasbord or as an appetizer and is usually accompanied
by a mustard-dill sauce (see recipe). When gravlax is presented as a
main course, it is garnished with lemon wedges as well as the
mustard-dill sauce and served with toast and perhaps a cucumber salad.
