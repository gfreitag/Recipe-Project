Title: GREEN BEAN & NEW POTATO SALAD
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 2 Servings
1 sm Clove garlic
1 ts Tarragon vinegar
1/4 c  Hellman's low fat mayo
(1g_fat/Tbs)
1 lb New potatoes (or other
Potatoes)
1 lb Fresh green beans
1 ea Salt and pepper to taste
Mince garlic very finely and blend into mayo along with vinegar. Set
aside to let flavors to blend. Scrub potatoes well and cut into 1-1
1/2" pieces. Place in steamer basket and steam until just tender
(10-15 min). While the potatoes steam, trim ends off green beans and
snap them in half. Rinse potatoes under cold water and place in
strainer to cool while you steam the green beans just until
crisp-tender (3-5 min). Rinse beans under cold water until cool and
place in strainer to drain. Toss potatoes and beans with mayo mixture
to coat and season with salt and pepper. You can chill this or just
eat it at room temperature. I imagine some red, yellow or green bell
pepper would also be good with this or maybe a little onion or celery.
