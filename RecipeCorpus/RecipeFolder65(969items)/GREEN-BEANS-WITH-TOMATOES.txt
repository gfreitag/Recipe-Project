CHOOSE BEANS THAT ARE BRIGHT GREEN and firm. The smaller ones will be
less fibrous. Top and tail them, then cut into pieces about 1
1/2-inches long and wash well. Peel the onions and slice them in thin
rounds. Warm the olive oil, add the onion, garlic, and cook over a
gentle heat for several minutes until the onions begin to soften.
Salt lightly, then add the beans and cover them with the chopped
tomatoes and herbs. Add several table- spoons tomato juice or water,
cover the pan tightly and cook over medium heat until the beans are
tender, about 15 minutes.
