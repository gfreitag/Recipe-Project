Title: GREEN ONION LATKES
Categories: Pancakes, Ceideburg
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Mealy potatoes, peeled and
-coarsely grated
6    To 10 green onions *
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
3 tb Matzo meal/flour, or
-combination

Bits of pungent green onion offset the richness of the potato.

Rinse potatoes in cold water, then squeeze out excess liquid.

Place potatoes in a mixing bowl with green onions, eggs, matzo meal,
salt and pepper. Mix well.

Heat about 1/8 to 1/4 inch oil in heavy frying pan, then drop
spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil. Fry several pancakes at a
time, cooking until golden on the first side, then turning and
cooking the other side. Serve immediately, accompanied by sour cream.

Variation: Instead of green onions, add 1/2 to 2/3 cup chopped chives.
