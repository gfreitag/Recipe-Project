Good capers are essential to this dish. If possible, visit a deli
whose owners are of Mediterranean extraction and buy bulk capers
which have been packed in salt. Rinse them to remove the salt before
using. If you have to use the more readily available capers bottled
in a vinegar solution, blot them dry of vinegar before using.

In a tablespoon of olive oil. gently fry a large onion, chopped. until
transparent. Add 4 cloves of garlic, crushed or finely chopped, and
cook for a minute or so longer, then add a 400 g tin of peeled
tomatoes. chopped, together with their juice, 1 tablespoon lemon
juice and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 20 minutes, then
add 2 heaped tablespoons of capers, the zest of a small lemon and a
tablespoon of finely chopped fresh mint. Simmer again until the sauce
is thick. Meanwhile heat the grill to very hot, dip 4 serving-size
pieces of rudderfish in olive oil and put them under the grill for
3-5 minutes, turning once if using a conventional grill. You may not
need to turn the fish at all if you have a fan assisted grill.

Spoon the sauce onto warmed plates, add the fish and serve,
preferably with good bread to ensure no sauce is wasted.
