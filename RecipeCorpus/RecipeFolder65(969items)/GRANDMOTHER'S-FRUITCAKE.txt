MAKE a liner for a 10-inch tube pan by drawing an 18-inch circle on
brown paper (not recycled). Cut out circle; set pan in center, and
draw around base of pan and inside tube. Remove pan, and fold circle
into eighths with lines on the outside.

CUT off pointed tip of triangle along line. Unfold paper, cut along
folds to the outside line. Place liner in pan; grease and set aside.
Repeat procedure for second pan.

COMBINE 1/2-cup flour, dates, and next 5 ingredients in a large bowl,
tossing gently to coat. Set aside.

BEAT butter at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy;
gradually add sugar, beating well. Add eggs, beating until blended
after each addition. Add milk and corn syrup, mixing well.

COMBINE remaining 3 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, and next 4
ingredients; add to butter mixture alternately with 1 cup brandy,
beginning and ending with flour mixture. Mix at low speed after each
addition until blended. Pour over fruit mixture; stir well. Spoon
batter into prepared pans. Place pecan halves in flour designs on top
of batter, if desired.

BAKE at 350 F for 1 hour or until a wooden pick inserted in center of
cake comes out clean. Remove from oven; cool completely in pans on
wire racks.

REMOVE cakes from pans, peel paper from cakes. Wrap in brandy-soaked
cheesecloth; store in airtight containers in a cool place. Pour a
little brandy over cakes each week for at least 1 month. Before
serving, place cherry halves in center of pecan flowers, if desired.
