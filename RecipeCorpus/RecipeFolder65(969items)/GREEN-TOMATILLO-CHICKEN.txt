frying pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and brown, turning as
needed, 8-12 minutes. Add tomatillos, onion, chilies, and garlic.
Cover and simmer, turning chicken occasionally, until meat is no
longer pink at thigh bone (cut to test), about 30 minutes. With a
slotted spoon, transfer chicken to a platter; keep warm. 2. Boil
sauce, uncovered, over high heat until most of the liquid evaporates,
6-8 minutes. Pour sauce over chicken. Sprinkle with cilantro. Add
salt and pepper to taste.
