Title: GREEK-STYLE BLACK-EYED PEAS
Categories: Canadian li, Herbs, Potatoes, Rice, Grains & be
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Olive oil
4    Green onions, sliced
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/2 ts Dried oregano
2 c  Black-eyed peas (19 oz.can),
-drained and rinsed
1/4 ts Grated lemon rind
2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 ts Pepper
1 pn Salt
2 tb Crumbled feta cheese,
-optional
In skillet, heat oil over medium heat; cook onions, garlic and
oregano for 2 minutes or until softened. Add 2 tablespoons water,
beans, lemon rind, juice, pepper and salt. Cover and cook for 1
minute until hot. (Beans can be refrigerated up to 24 hours.) Serve
cold or at room temperature. Sprinkle with feta (if using).

If available, substitute 2 teaspoons fresh oregano or dill for the
dried oregano.

NOTES : I've made a variation of this dish.  I added a chopped
tomato, a handlful of chopped, pitted Kalamato olives, and doubled
(or more) the feta cheese.  It's very good, and serves as a main dish
for two. Could handle a bit more oregano. Also, I started with dry
peas rather than tinned.
