Title: GRENADINE SLICES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Portion Four-Way Sweet 1/2
-cup grenadine syrup
*Use Grated Raw Potato Starter

1 cup Grape-Nuts Cereal
Bread Dough

As soon as the bread dough has started to rise mix the syrup and
grape-nuts together so that the cereal will have time to soak up all
the syrup. Roll the dough out quite thin to about 20 x 10 inches. Cut
in two crosswise. Spread filling thinly over the surface leaving a
2-inch strip along one side of each square. Fold over this bare strip
onto filling and continue folding until a flat roll is formed. Lay
both rolls lengthwise on 10 x 15 inch cookie sheet with seam on
underside. Flatten them by rolling with the pin until they are about
3-1/2 inches wide and as long as the pan. Do this gently so that the
filling does not break through. Brush tops with soft butter.  Let
stand in warm place until light. Bake in oven preheated to 325 about
45 minutes until the crust has a beautiful bisque tint. Glaze while
still warm with a powdered sugar and White Wine frosting. If
available, decorate with a row of candy raspberries down the center
of each roll so that there will be one on each 1- 1/2 inch to 2 inch
slice. (If rolls are to be frozen for later use wait until they have
been thawed and warmed to glaze and decorate.)

White Wine Frosting: 2 Tbsp. soft butter 2 Tbsp. white wine 1 1/2 cup
powdered sugar 3 drops Waldmeister Essence* and a drop or tow of green
coloring or 1/4 tsp. Rose extract and a drop or two of red coloring

Beat butter, wine and sugar together until smooth. Add preferred
flavoring and carefully add the coloring for a very delicate tint.
