Grilled salmon steaks with spicy pineapple sauce is as delightful to
look at as it is to eat. What's more, the sauce goes equally well
over lots of other fish and meat dishes.

HEAT PINEAPPLE, pineapple juice, lime juice, garlic and jalapeno
pepper to boiling in medium saucepan; reduce heat and simmer,
uncovered, 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro; heat to boiling.

MIX CORNSTARCH and cold water; stir into boiling mixture. Boil,
stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat; cool 2 to 3
minutes.

STIR IN NUTRASWEET SPOONFUL; season to taste with salt and pep- per.
Serve warm sauce over fish.

NOTE: Pineapple-Cilantro Sauce is also excellent served with pork and
lamb.
