Title: GREEN BEANS SOUTHERN STYLE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Green beans, trimmed
-and washed
1 lg White onion, chopped
1    Green (Bell) pepper,
-chopped
1/2 lb Sliced smoked bacon,
-cut into squares
Salt (it won't need much)
And black pepper to taste
6 sm New potatoes, (about the
Size of golf balls),opt'l
If the beans are very small and tender, leave them whole. Otherwise,
cut in half lengthwise (known for some obscure reason as
"Frenching"), and cut the individual beans into bite-sized lengths.

Place the beans, onion, pepper, bacon into a large stewing pot. Cover
with water.  Cover the pot, and cook on low heat until the beans are
very tender (2-3 hours is about right -- these are NOT supposed to be
crisp). About 30 minutes before serving, add the potatoes if used,
and season to taste. Don't worry about overcooking the beans, you
can't -- they're supposed to be a dull green and very tender
:-)

Serve the beans, along with a generous portion of the liquid, and the
potatoes, if used.  This may be used as an accompaniment for any
Southern-style meal, or may serve, with cornbread or biscuits on the
side, as a meal itself.
