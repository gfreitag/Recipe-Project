Cover tightly and place in preheated oven for 30 minutes. In a small

Bring to a boil and let cook 1 minute. Remove turnips from oven,
remove cover and pour the cream mixture over them. Sprinkle with
Roquefort and return to oven. Let bake, uncovered, another 20 to 25

advance to this point and kept covered at room temperature.
