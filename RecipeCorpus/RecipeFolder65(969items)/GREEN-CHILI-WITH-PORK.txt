partially covered, for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Cut the Poblano into 1/2" strips.  Add them to the chili and cook ,
stirring often, for another 30 to 45 minutes or until the pork is
tender and the chili is thickened to your liking. Taste for correct
seasonings and let cook another 5 minutes.  Serve hot.
NOTE: To roast Poblanos, stick them on a serving fork and turn over
a gas burner until thoroughly charred. Wrap chilies in a paper bag
after you roast them. When cool, rinse under cold running water,
rubbing off the burned skin.  Pat dry and de-stem chilies. Serves 6
generously.
