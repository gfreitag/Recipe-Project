lobster with cold water. Allow lobster to cool. Heat grill to a
moderately high heat. Split lobsters in half. Remove meat from claws.
Lightly brush meat with basil butter and place lobsters on grill,
meat side down for 3 - 4 minutes. Turn over, and brush meat liberally
with more butter and continue grilling for 3 - 4 minutes with shell
side down, until shell is bright red. At that time place claw meat on
grill and cook for 3 - 4 minutes. Remove lobster from grill. Serve

Salad: In large non-stick pan cook bacon until crispy. Drain and set
aside. In same pan heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and saute Chanterelles
until golden brown. Season lightly with salt and pepper and set
aside. Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add corn and onion
and cook for 2 - 3 minutes, until the corn is cooked and the onion is
tender. Add peppers and toss until peppers are warm. Add mushrooms
and frisee to pan. Toss for 1 minute. Add remaining oil, vinegar and
salt and pepper to taste. Toss together until frisee just begins to
