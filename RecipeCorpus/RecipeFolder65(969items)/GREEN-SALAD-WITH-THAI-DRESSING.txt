Recipe by: NURPPL@NURSE.EMORY.EDU Essentially, this is just a peanutty
vinagrette dressing that I made in the food processor. I added the
liquid ingredients first, until it looked like the right mix of oil
to acidic liquids (rice vinegar and lime juice). Then I added the
rest of the ingredients and processed for a few seconds. From there I
just went by appearance and taste, adding more liquid or peanut
butter to get the right consistency, and more of each of the other
ingredients for other various characteristics-- sweetness, saltiness,
acidity, spiciness. We served the salad dressing on the side with the
salad, and provided extra chopped peanuts, cilantro, and green onions
to let people add their own to taste.
