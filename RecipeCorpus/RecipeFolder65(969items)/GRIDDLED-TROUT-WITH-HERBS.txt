The herbs are what might have been used in Anglo-Saxon East Anglia,
but use whatever you might fancy. Try to use fresh, although dried is
acceptable. Put one sprig or generous shake of rosemary down the
middle of each fish. Chop all the other herbs and seasonings and mash
them into the soft butter. Use this to coat the fish generously on
each side. Griddle, barbeque or grill it for 4-5 minutes on each side
or till the skin is well browned and the flesh flaking off the bone.
Baste now and then with the butter which runs off. Serve at once with
lot of fresh bread and a salad or a simple green vegetable.
