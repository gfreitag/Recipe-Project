Corn, of course, is not native to China, but this Chinese way of
cooking it is delicious.

IN A SMALL PAN, combine the butter, dark soy sauce, Sichuan
peppercorn and chiles. Make a charcoal fire and, when the coals are
ash white, grill the corn. Baste them with the soy butter and cook
for 5-to-8 minutes, turning frequently. Serve at once.
