Title: GRILLED CORNISH HENS WITH HABANERO GLAZE
Categories: Chile head
Yield: 4 Servings
1    2 Cornish Hens, per person
Fresh or thawed if frozen
1 sm Jar of Lime Marmalade
(recommend the British
Versions)
1    2 Habaneros,seeded and
Julienned, the thinner the
Better
1    Stripped rind (Green part
Only!) from a lime
Olive oil
Tequila, rum, sherry or
-water-use only enough to
-slightly dilute if glaze
-is too thick.
On a kettle type grill pile the readied coals about the side of the
grill. Oil lightly the poultry and place in the middle of the grill
with clear space about them. Cover the grill for 5 minutes and cook
the poultry without the glaze. While they cook mix the marmalade,
chile, lime spritz and liquid of choice. If you heat this up in
microwave or on stovetop it will be easier to work with. Using
basting brush to stir and apply with. Uncover the C.H.'s and baste
with sauce. Continue to cover,grill-bake, uncover and baste, and
repeat until the birds are done. I won't say a time since grills and
conditions vary but only cook until done. If the glaze gets too brown
or charred it does not taste as good, either, so definately watch
this as it cooks. and as we say here in Kentucky 'cornish hens is
jes' a lil' chicken' (for which we pay a premium price!). I would
guess that this glaze would work well with almost any poultry except
the stronger flavoured ones like mallard or turkey.

This dish can be done in a 350 degree oven, too. Adios.
