Title: GREEN TOMATO CHUTNEY
Categories: Relishes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Green tomatoes
1/2 lb Tart green apples
6    Dried chili peppers (each
1" long)
1/2 lb Peeled shallots or small
Onions
1/2 c  Packed golden raisins
1 c  Packed dark brown sugar
1 tb Grated crystallized ginger
1 1/2 ts Minced garlic (about 3
Cloves)
1 1/4 c  Cider vinegar
Cut the tomatoes into 1/2 inch cubes, to measure about 6 cups. Peel,
core, and slice the apples, to measure about 2 cups. If you are using
dried whole chiles, break them up and remove some seeds, if you want
a milder chutney. For easy peeling of the shallots or onions, first
cover them with boiling water, stir, drain, and immerse in cold water
to prevent their cooking. Drain again, and peel. Place all the
ingredients in a wide 4-quart saucepan, bring to a boil quickly, and
boil about 30 minutes, or until the chutney is as thick as jam.  Stir
occasionally to prevent sticking. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars,
seal, cool, label, and store. Makes 3 pints (Note: Shallots are
preferred, but if you use onions, substitute either
raw pearl onions or frozen small boiling onions)
