Title: GRILLED DOVE
Categories: Poultry, Barbecue
Yield: 4 Servings
12    Dove breasts
2    Garlic cloves, crushed
4 tb Unsalted butter
Salt & pepper to taste
In a saucepan, heat the butter and saute the garlic until it is
translucent. Allow to cool.

Pepper and salt the breasts. Place the breasts on the hot grill and
brush them with the garlic butter. Don't skimp on the butter, dove
breasts are very lean. Baste every minute or so. Turn the breasts
after 3 to 5 minutes and grill and baste for another 1 to 2 minutes.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe.
