Categories: Lamb, Meats, Greek, Wine
Yield: 6 Servings
2 md Onions
3    Green bell peppers
4    To 5 lb leg of lamb; boned
-and cubed
1 ts Dried oregano; crumbled
1/2 c  Olive oil
3    Bay leaves
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
3    Garlic cloves; minced
Juice of 2 lemons
1 c  Dry white wine
1 ts ;salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
6    Tomatoes; quartered
Cut onions into quarters and separate layers.  Cut peppers into
quarters, and cut each quarter in half. Combine all ingredients,
except tomatoes, in a shallow roasting pan, mixing well so that meat
is completely coated. Marinate in refrigerator for several hours.
Take out of refrigerator and let sit out about 20 minutes to come to
room temperature. Before cooking, add tomatoes to marinade and mix
well to coat with juices. Place meat cubes on skewers, alternating
with green pepper slices, onion slices, and tomato wedges. Lay
skewers in pan with marinade, turning several times. Put skewered
lamb on a rack over pan containing marinade and place under preheated
broiler. Turn several times during cooking and baste with marinade
from pan.  Cooking time depends on your taste; for medium rare allow
about 15-18 minutes. Serve skewers on plates with rice pilaf.

Alternatively you can barbecue lamb using marinade as the basting
sauce. This is always the way we cook this dish--rain or shine. Check
doneness of lamb at about 10 minutes and if not done to your liking,
cook further until cooked through.
