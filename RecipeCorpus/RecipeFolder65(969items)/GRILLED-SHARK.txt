Title: GRILLED SHARK
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Filet of Shark
1    Slice apple per filet
Oil
Spicy chutney of your choice
* Get rather thick slices of Shark and use 1 per person. Slice the
filet along the side to make a pocket. Slice the apple slice so you
can put it in the pocket. Oil the filet with canola oil to keep it
from sticking and season with salt and pepper (or any other seasoning
you like. I like to use curry powder. ) Grill on moderate coals for
about 10 minutes per side. As always check and adjust as required.
Serve with a spicy dressing or chutney of your choice. Submitted By
