Title: GREEN MEADOWS SIX-WEEK BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
5 c  All purp- flour
3 c  Sugar
5 ts Baking soda
4    Eggs
2 ts Salt
1 c  Veg. oil
2 ts Ground allspice
1 qt Buttermilk
15 oz Box bran flakes w/raisins
2 ts Vanilla
Using the largest bowl you have, combine the first four ingredients.
Add the bran flakes and sugar, and mix. In a mixer bowl, beat the
eggs. Add the oil, buttermilk, and vanilla to the eggs and blend.
Pour the egg mixture over the flour mixture and stir well. Transfer
the batter to a large plastic container that has a tight-fitting
cover, and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. This batter
will keep for 6 weeks. (Date the container the day you make the
muffins)

When ready to bake, do not stir batter when dipping out to fill the
muffin pan.  To bake, preheat the oven to 375 F. Using about 1/2 cup
batter for each, drop the batter into paper-lined muffin tins. Bake
the muffins for 20 min, or until the top springs back when touched
with your finger.
