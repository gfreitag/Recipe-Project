Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Red Potatoes, Cut Into
1/2-inch Dice
1 md Onion, Finely Chopped
2 1/2 c  Fish Stock Or Clam Juice
1 md Bay Leaf
1/2 lb Fresh Green Chiles
2 c  Peanut Oil
1/2 c  Fresh Corn Kernels

1 lg Sweet Red Bell Pepper,

2 c  Half & Half

1 tb Butter
1 ts Fresh Marjoram, Chopped
Gently boil the potatoes for about 4 minutes in salted water, rinse
and cool.  Cook the onion with 1 cup of the stock and the bay leaf
over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until cooked through, but not
browned. Discard the bay leaf and cool. Fry the green chiles in the
oil for about 4 to 5 minutes until the skin is blistered, but not
blackened. Skin the chiles, remove the seeds and cut into 1/2-inch
dice. Steam the corn in 1/4 cup of water in a covered pan for 2
minutes or until tender.

In a large pan, combine the oysters with their liquor, the remaining
stock, and the green chiles. Heat for 2 minutes, then add the
potatoes, onion and red pepper, and bring to a boil. Add the half and
half, keeping the mixture below a boil to keep the half and half from
separating. Add the salt, corn and butter. Pour into soup bowls and
garnish with the marjoram.
