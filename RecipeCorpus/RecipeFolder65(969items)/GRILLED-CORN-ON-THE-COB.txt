Title: GRILLED CORN ON THE COB
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Corn on the cob
Buy the corn still in the husks. Strip back the husks without tearing
them off.  Pull out all of the silks and kind of scrub at the ear to
get the silks out (silks are the stringy parts for all of you
non-midwesterners :)). Pull the husks back up over the ear to
completely encase it. Soak the ears in a bucket of salt water
overnight. Take the ears directly from the bucket and put them on the
grill to cook. To eat, just pull back the husks and use them for a
kind of a handle, butter and enjoy.

The salt water acts both to salt the ears and also to moisten them so
the corn doesn't dry out and burn on the grill. I've done this on the
small scale with just a few friends but I've also seen it done with a
large group where all of the ears were soaking in a large plastic
garbage can.

Other ways to do this involve buttering the ear before grilling
rather than soaking in the salt water and some people wrap them in
foil rather than grilling them in the husks.
