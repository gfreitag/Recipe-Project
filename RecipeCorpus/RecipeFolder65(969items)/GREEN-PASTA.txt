Title: GREEN PASTA
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Extra large eggs
6 oz Frozen chopped spinach,
-defrosted, squeezed very
-dry
3 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
Plus extra for dusting
-worksurface
1/2 ts Olive oil
Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
and spinach. Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and spinach
and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the
well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough
will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Yield: 1 pound NOTES
: Note:do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe,
they are essential for a light pasta.
