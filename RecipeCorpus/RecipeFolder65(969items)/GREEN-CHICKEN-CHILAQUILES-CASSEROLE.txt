Title: GREEN CHICKEN CHILAQUILES CASSEROLE
Categories: Casseroles, Main dish, Mesamexican, Lnet
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lg Whole chicken breasts, split
Salt
Fresh course ground black
-pepper
2 c  Chicken stock
3 1/2 c  *Tomatillo Salsa
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 md Onion, sliced paper thin
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
12 ea Corn tortillas
1 c  Grated manchego cheese
1 c  Grated panela cheese
1/2 c  Grated a¤ejo cheese
Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.

Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan. Place the
breasts in the stock, reduce the heat to moderate, cover and cook
until the meat is tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool in the
stock.

When cool, remove the skin and bones and shred the meat into
bite-sized pieces. Strain and reserve the stock for another use.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh *tomatillo salsa, heavy
cream, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the onion and shredded
chicken pieces.

Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat.

Cook the tortillas just about 5 seconds per side to soften and then
transfer to a large colander to drain.

* See "Tomatillo Salsa" provided separately with this recipe.

Preheat the oven to 350øF. Butter a 4-quart casserole.

Combine the cheeses in a mixing bowl.

To assemble the chilaquiles, spread a thin layer of the cheese
mixture over the bottom of the baking dish. Push the solids in the
bowl of chicken and tomatillo sauce to the side so the liquids form a
pool in the bottom.

Layer one third of the moist tortillas over the cheese and top with
half of the chicken mixture with its sauce.

Sprinkle half of the remaining cheese over the chicken. Repeat the
layers, ending with a layer of torillas on top. Cover tightly with
aluminum foil.

Bake 30 minutes or until the edges are slightly brown. Let sit for 10
minutes before slicing and serving or unmolding.
