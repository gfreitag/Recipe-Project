Preheat the broiler or grill.

Cut the duck, pork butt and pancetta into 1/4-inch cubes. Run the meat
through a grinder. The mixture should be quite rough.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat with the cinnamon,
cumin and salt. Mix very well. Divide the mixture into 8 equal oval
patties, about 1/2-inch thick. Wrap each patty in caul fat. Place the
patties under the broiler or on the grill and cook through, about 4
to 5 minutes per side. Set aside.

In a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil until just
smoking. Add the garlic and sautJ until very light brown, about 2
minutes. Toss in the kale and sautJ, stirring quickly, about 2 to 3
minutes, until just wilted but not too soft. Remove from the heat and
season with salt and pepper.

Divide the mixture equally on 4 plates and serve.

Yield: 4 servings
