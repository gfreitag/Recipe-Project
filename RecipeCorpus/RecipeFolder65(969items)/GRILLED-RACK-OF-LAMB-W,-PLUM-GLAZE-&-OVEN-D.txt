1. Quarter plums; remove pits. Combine plums, honey, jalapeno, sugar,
vinegar, and lime juice in a small nonreactive saucepan. Cook over
low heat until plums are very soft and juice is slightly thickened,
about 30 minutes, If plums are not juicy, add water a little at a
time during cooking to avoid scorching. Remove from heat, strain, and
discard solids.

2. Heat grill or cast-iron grill pan. Season lamb well with salt and
pepper and wrap bones with foil to prevent burning. Grill lamb fat
side down for 5 minutes, brush with plum glaze, and turn over. Repeat
glaz- ing every minute or so thereafter. For rare lamb, cook until it
reaches an internal temperature of 135', 10 to 12 minutes; cook
longer for medium or well, Let the meat rest for 10 minutes after
grilling.

3. Toss Oven Dried Plums with some of the remalmng glaze. Carve racks
into chops. Serve 2 chops per person with the glazed plums; Garnish
with sprigs of thyme.
