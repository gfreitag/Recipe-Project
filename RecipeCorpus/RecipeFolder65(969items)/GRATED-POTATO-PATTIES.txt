These are gorgeous. There is something very special about the taste of
grated raw potato lightly cooked, and these patties are distinctly
moreish. You probably won't have any leftovers!

Soak the grated potatoes in cold water. Drain them through a large
sieve, pressing out all the water, then pat them dry with kitchen
paper.

Mix the beaten egg, onion and cornflour together and season with salt,
pepper and nutmeg. Stir in the grated potato.

In a small, heavy-bottomed frying-pan heat a little oil until it is
hot, then drop the mixture 2-3 tbs at a time into the pan, and
flatten each pancake with the back of a spoon. Cook on both sides
until golden. Drain on kitchen paper and keep hot in a low oven until
ready to eat.
