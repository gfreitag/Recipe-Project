Title: GREEN PEPPERCORN MUSTARD
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 Cup
3 tb Mustard seeds
1/3 c  Dry mustard, preferably
-imported
1/2 c  Hot tap water
1/2 c  White wine vinegar
1/2 c  Dry white wine or dry
-white vermouth
Big pinch of cinnamon
1/2 ts Dried tarragon, crumbled
1/2 ts Dill seed
2 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
Big pinch of ground cloves
1 ts Honey
1 tb Green peppercorns (drained
-water-packed or freeze
-dried)
1.  Combine the mustard seeds, dry mustard, water, and vinegar in a
bowl and let stand for at least 3 hours. 2. In a small saucepan,
bring to a boil the wine or vermouth, cinnamon, tarragon, dill seed,
salt, and cloves. Strain into the mustard mixture and stir. Add the
honey and green peppercorns. 3.  Scape into a food processor or
blender and whirl to a puree. 4. Transfer to the top of a double
boiler over simmering water. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring
often. (The mixture should be a bit softer than finished mustard, as
it will thicken as it cools). Crush a few more peppercorns slightly
and add, if you like texture and a little more bite. 5.  Scrape into
a jar, cool, and refrigerate. Keeps indefinitely. Makes about 1 cup
