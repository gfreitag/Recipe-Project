Title: GREEN BEANS VINAIGRETTE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb FRESH GREEN BEANS, TRIMMED
1/2 ea LEMON JUICE, SQUEEZED
2 ts MEAUX (POMMERY) MUSTARD
3 tb OLIVE OIL
Drop the beans into a saucepan of rapidly boiling water, let the water
return to a boil, and simmer the beans for 5 minutes or until they are
cooked but still have some bite. Drain them, rinse them with cold
water until they're no longer warm, and pile them into a colander;
set them aside. In a bowl, whisk together the lemon, salt and pepper
to taste, and mustard and, when the mixture is smooth, add the oil a
little at a time. Arrange the beans in a shallow dish and pour the
dressing over them. Serve at once.  This recipe goes best with my
Rack of Lamb DGP.
