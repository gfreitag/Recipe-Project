Title: GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST (FOR ONE)
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Boneless chicken breast,
-skin on is best, but
-skinless will work
1 tb Mayonnaise
1 ts Spicy mustard (I use
-Zatarain's Cajun Mustard
-for this, but any
-spicy coarse-grained
-mustard is okay)
-Juice of one lime
-Coarsely ground pepper to
-taste (I use quite a bit)
Mix the last four ingredients together, and smear liberally over the
chicken breast.  Allow the chicken to sit in the mixture for about an
hour if possible.

Preheat the grill on medium-high for about 10 minutes. Place chicken
breast, skin side down on grill.  Cook until chicken is about half
done (maybe 6 minutes). Turn, and baste skin side of chicken with any
marinade remaining in the pan.  Continue cooking until chicken is
done.
