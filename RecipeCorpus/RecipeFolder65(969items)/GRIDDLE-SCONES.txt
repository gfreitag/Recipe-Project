Title: GRIDDLE SCONES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Self-rising flour
1 pn Salt
3 tb Butter or margarine
2/3 c  Currants
3/4 ts Groung nutmeg
1    Egg
1/3 c  Milk
Keywords: Scones, sugar free, bread

Preparation time  15 minutes, cooking time about 4 minutes per scone.

Mix the flour and salt together, and rub in the butter until the
mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.

Stir in the currants and nutmeg, then push the mixture gently to the
sides of the bowl to form a well in the center.

Beat together the egg and milk, and pour into the well in the center
of the flour.

Using a wooden spoon, mix the egg and milk mixture into the flour,
stirring from the center of the bowl and drawing the flour in from
the sides to form a smooth, thick batter. If batter is too thick, add
a little extra milk until it becomes a soft dropping consistency.

Heat a heavy-based frying pan on top of a moderate heat, and grease
with a little butter or oil.

Drop tablespoons of the batter into the hot pan, and cook for 2-3
minutes, or until the bases are set and have turned golden brown.

Turn the scones over and cook on the other side in the same way.

Serve from the pan with sugar-free preserves.

NOTE:  These scones freeze well, and can be re-heated by wrapping in a
clean dish towel and standing in a warm oven until they are heated
through.
