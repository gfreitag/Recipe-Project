saucepan and boil until reduced to approximately 1/2 cup. Off heat,
whisk 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil slowly into reduction to thicken
the sauce. Whisk in white wine vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. Set
aside and keep warm.

Lightly oil the scallops and season with salt, pepper and a few drops
of lemon juice. Brush kale leaves with oil and season lightly. Grill
kale on both sides until the leaves are slightly charred and cooked
through. Grill scallops until just cooked (center should be slightly
opaque). Arrange kale attractively in the center of warm plates and
drizzle a few drops of sherry vinegar over. Place scallops on top and
spoon beet sauce around. Garnish with chive sticks and yellow pepper
and serve immediately.
