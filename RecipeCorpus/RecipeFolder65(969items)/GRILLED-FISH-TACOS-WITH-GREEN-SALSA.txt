Title: GRILLED FISH TACOS WITH GREEN SALSA
Categories: Main dish, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
3 1/2 c  Finely shredded red or green
--cabbage
1/4 c  White distilled vinegar
Salt and pepper
3/4 lb Fresh tomatillos *
2 tb Salad oil
1    Onion, cut into 1/2" slices
1 1/2 lb Firm-fleshed skinned fish
-fillets (lingcod, sea bass)
4    Jalapeno chilies
2 ts Lime juice
3/4 c  Fresh cilantro leaves
1    Clove garlic
12    Warm corn or low-fat flour
--tortillas (6-7 inch)
Low-fat sour cream
Lime wedges
* Look for the small green tomatillos with papery husks in some
supermarkets and Latino grocery stores. If unavailable, substitute
small Roma tomatoes and add more lime juice to taste.

Mix cabbage with vinegar and 3 tablespoons water.  Add salt and
pepper to taste.  Cover and chill.

Remove and discard husks from tomatillos; rinse tomatillos. Thread
onto skewers.  Brush some of the oil lightly onto onion slices. Rinse
fish and pat dry. Brush fish with remaining oil.

Place tomatillos, onion, and chilies on a barbecue grill (high heat).
Cook, turning as needed, until vegetables are browned, 8-10 mintues.
Set aside to cool.

Place fish on grill (med-high heat).  Cook, turning once, until fish
is opaque but still moist-looking in thickest part (cut to test),
10-14 minutes.

Remove stems from chilies; remove seeds (if you want less heat). In a
blender or food processor, whirl tomatillos, chilies, lime juice, 1/4
c cilantro, and garlic until smooth. Chop onion. Add the chopped
onion to salsa mixture, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour into small
bowl.

To assemble each taco, fill a tortilla with a little cabbage relish,
a few chunks of fish, salsa, and sour cream. Add a squeeze of lime,
and salt and pepper to taste.
