Categories: Main dish, British, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------RISSOLES-------------------------------
8 oz Green lentils
1 pt Hot water
2 oz Margarine
1 ea Onion, finely chopped
1 ea Carrot, finely chopped
1 ea Green bell pepper, diced
2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
1/4 ts Cayenne
1/2 ts Coriander
1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Curry powder
2 ts Tomato paste

1 tb Parsley, chopped
MMMMM--------------------------COATING-------------------------------
Vegetable oil
2 oz Wholewheat flour
2 oz Breadcrumbs
2 oz Oats
MMMMM------------------------YOGURT SAUCE-----------------------------
1/2 pt Plain soy yogurt
2 tb Parsley, chopped
1 tb Chives
1 ea Garlic clove, crushed
1/4 ts Cumin
Lemon juice, to taste
Salt & pepper
RISSOLES: Combine lentils & water, bring to a boil, reduce heat &
simmer for 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender (I think it
needs closer to an hour to get them really tender). Add more water if
necessary. Heat the margarine, add the onion & cook for a couple of
minutes. Add the carrot & pepper & cook until tender, about 10
minutes. Add the spices, tomato paste & salt & pepper.  Mix together
well & stir in the lentils. Add the parsley. Allow to cool till it is
cool enough to handle. Divide the mixture into 12 portions & shape
into patties. Coat them in flour, dip in some oil & coat in the
breadcrumbs & oats (I omitted this step). Shallow fry in hot oil
until the patties are golden brown on both sides. Drain well & serve
with the sauce. SAUCE: Combine all ingredients together & chill.
MARK'S NOTE: The vegetables do need to be finely diced, it may well
be easier to use a food processor. Also, if using the oats, I'd
recommend running them through the processor too so that they
resemble oat flour.
