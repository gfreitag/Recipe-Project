From Mrs. Ruben Leyendecker

1. Soften yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine boiling water,
oatmeal, molasses, shortening and salt. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in 2
cups flour and beat well. Add eggs and yeast mixture and beat well.
Add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.

2. Turn out onto lightly floured surface, cover and let rest 10
minutes. Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Place in lightly
greased bowl, turning dough once. Cover with a dish towel and let
rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch
down. Coat 2 well-greased 8-1/2x4-1/2x2-1/2" loaf pans with 2
tablespoons of rolled oats in each pan.

3. Divide dough in half. Shape 2 loaves and place in pans. Cover. Let
rise until almost double in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Brush with
mixture of 1 egg white and 1 tablespoon water; sprinkle lightly with
rolled oats. Bake at 350'F. for 40-50 minutes. Cover with foil or
brown paper after baking 15 minutes if tops are getting too brown.
