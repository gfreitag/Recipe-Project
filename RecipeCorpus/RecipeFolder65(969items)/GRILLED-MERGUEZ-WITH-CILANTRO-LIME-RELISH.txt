1 1/2 lb Merguez sausage, separated
-into links
1 c  Coarsely chopped cilantro
2    Limes, juice only
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
The article says merguez is a spicy North African lamb sausage and
that it is available in Middle Eastern markets. She doesn't offer a
substitute, but I'd think chorizo or hot links might work alongside
the other dishes.

Grill sausages, turning several times to cook evenly, until they are
slightly charred on the outside, still juicy on the inside.

Meanwhile, combine cilantro, lime juice and garlic.

Serve hot merguez with cilantro-lime relish on the side.
