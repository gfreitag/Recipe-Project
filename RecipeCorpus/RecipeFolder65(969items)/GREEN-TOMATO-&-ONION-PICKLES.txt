Title: GREEN TOMATO & ONION PICKLES
Categories: Jams, Relishes, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Pints
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
3 c  Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Salt
6 tb Mustard seed
2 ts Whole allspice
1 ts Whole cloves
4 qt Green tomatoes, cut into 1/2
-- inch slices
1 1/2 qt Medium onions, sliced
Combine the first 4 ingredients in a kettle.  Tie the Allspice and
Cloves in a cheesecloth bag and add to the kettle. Bring to a boil.
Add the tomatoes and onions. Boil, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until
just tender, lifting the slices from the bottom to the surface with a
fork during cooking.  Drain, reserving the liquid, remove the bag and
pack the pickles into clean, hot preserve jars. Reheat the liquid to
boiling and pour at once into the jars over the pickles. Seal,
adjusting the lids as the manufacturer directs. Process in a hot
water bath, the timing adjusted to your conditions.  (Contact your
extension agent for information on canning.)
