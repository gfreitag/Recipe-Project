Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat cast iron grill pan
over medium high heat. Add chicken and grill for 3-4 minutes per side
or until meat is no longer pink in the middle.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a bowl whisk together olive oil,
thyme, paprika and grated Parmesan. Add bread cubes and toss to coat.
On a baking sheet spread out bread cubes in a single layer and bake
until golden about 8-10 minutes.

For the dressing, combine garlic, mustard, vinegar and two pinches of
salt in a bowl and process using a hand blender or whisk. Add
mayonnaise and blend together to form a thick base. In a slow stream
add olive oil. Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. If
desired, add anchovy to dressing to create a deeper, saltier flavor.

Place ripped up romaine lettuce leaves in a large bowl and toss with
several tablespoons of the dressing. Add grated Parmesan and toss to
combine. Slice grilled chicken into thin strips. Arrange lettuce on a
plate and top with chicken strips. Garnish with chopped parsley and
anchovies, if desired.=7F
