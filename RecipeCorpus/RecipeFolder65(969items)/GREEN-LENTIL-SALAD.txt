Rinse lentils and discard any pebbles. Place lentils, onion, garlic
and bay leaf in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water by 1".
Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and
simmer, covered, until lentils are tender, 25-35 minutes. Add liquid
as needed; liquid should be absorbed when lentils are done.

Discard onion, garlic and bay leaf. Whisk vinegar, oil and salt
together in a small bowl. Pour over warm lentils and toss. Before
serving, season with pepper and additional salt, if necessary. Serve
warm.

Makes 6-8 servings.
