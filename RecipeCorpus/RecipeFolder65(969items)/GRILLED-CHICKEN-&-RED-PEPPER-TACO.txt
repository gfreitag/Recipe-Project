6    (8-in) flour tortillas
LIGHT A GRILL OR PREHEAT a broiler. Pound the chicken breasts to an
even thickness, and grill or broil on both sides until cooked
through, but not dried out, about 4 minutes on a side. It makes sense
to grill the peppers at the same time. Slice, and set aside. Combine
the bell peppers, celery, onion, black beans and cilantro in a mixing
bowl. Combine the vinegar, oil, orange juice, lime juice, garlic,
coriander, pepper. Combine with salt and sour cream or yogurt in a
jar with a tight-fitting lid. Shake well, and pour the dressing over
the vegetables. Marinate the vegetables for 1 hour at room
temperature. Place a large skillet over medium heat, and grill the
tortillas for 30 seconds on a side to soften. To serve, divide the
chicken among the tortillas, placing it at the center of the
tortilla. Divide the vegetables and their dressing on top of the
chicken, and roll the tortilla into a cylinder. Serve immediately;
the dish should be at room temperature. Serves 6. Note: The chicken
breasts, vegetable mixture and dressing can all be prepared a day in
advance. Do not marinate the vegetables for more than 1 hour. Cover
with aluminum foil to reheat. Reheat the chicken in a 300F oven for
15 minutes.
