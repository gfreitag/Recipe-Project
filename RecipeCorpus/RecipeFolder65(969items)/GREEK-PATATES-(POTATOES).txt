Title: GREEK PATATES (POTATOES)
Categories: Beach, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb White potatoes -- peel and
Quarter
1/2 c  Yellow onions -- chopped
1/4 c  Garlic -- finely minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Basil
1 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
Water -- as needed
Preheat the oven to 400. In a large baking pan place the potatoes (add
enough potatoes so that they fill the pan up, 3/4" from the top).
Sprinkle on the onions, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, lemon
juice, and vegetable oil. Add enough water so that the potatoes are
just covered. Stir the ingredients together very thoroughly so that
everything is well mixed.

Bake the potato mixture for 45 minutes. Carefully stir the ingredients
together so that they are remixed. Bake for another 45 minutes, or
until potatoes are tender. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon.
Serve 6 to 8.

NOTES : People really love these potatoes!  Unique wonderful flavor,
simple to make. But Tom Papadakis doesn't tell us which vegetable oil
they use. Source: Joan Stromquist. Carl Stromquist. Southern
