Categories: Hamburger, Lamb, Greek, Beef, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Ground lamb or beef
1 md Onion, minced
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/3 c  Uncooked rice
2 tb Minced parsley
1 ts Dried basil or mint
1 ts Dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
3    Eggs
2 tb Vegetable oil
Chicken or beef stock
1/4 c  Lemon juice
Cooked rice Minced parsley

Put meat into a bowl with onion, garlic, uncooked rice, herbs, salt
and pepper.  Beat two of the egg whites until they froth and add them
as well.

Reserve yolks and the other egg for the sauce.  Gently mix with a
fork or your hands, and form walnut-size balls. Fry meatballs in
vegetable oil over low heat. When lightly brown, remove with a
slotted spoon to a saucepan. Add enough stock to cover meatballs, and
simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.

Pour off stock through a sieve, and measure it.  You will need 1 1/2
cups for the sauce. To make the sauce, beat reserved egg yolks and
the whole egg together until quite frothy. Whisk in lemon juice bit
by bit, then whisk in hot stock bit by bit, beating steadily. Pour
over meatballs, and cook, stirring, over low heat until sauce
thickens. Do not let it come to a boil, or it will separate. Serve on
a bed of rice, sprinkled with parsley.

Makes four servings.
