1. Remove and discard stems from spinach; you should have about 8 cups
leaves. Place spinach in salad bowl with onion, olives, and cheese.
2. In a small bowl combine vinegar, oregano, garlic, and salt.

3. In a small pan swirl olive oil over medium heat until it is just
warm to touch (2 to 3 minutes). Using a whisk or fork, gradually beat
hot oil into vinegar mixture.

4. Lightly and quickly mix hot dressing with spinach mixture. Gently
stir in croutons. Serve at once, offering freshly ground pepper to
taste.

Baguette Croutons: Cut baguette crosswise into 24 thin slices. In a
small pan over medium heat melt butter; add oil and garlic. Place
bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Brush with butter
mixture. Bake in a 250Â° F oven until crisp and lightly browned (25 to
30 minutes).
