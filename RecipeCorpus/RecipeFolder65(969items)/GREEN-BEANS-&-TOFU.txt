Title: GREEN BEANS & TOFU
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Olive oil
x  Garlic
x  Green beans (canned)
x  Tofu
x  Mushrooms
Last week when I cooked some Green Beans I put a bit of Olive Oil in a
stick-free skillet on medium heat, then minced a clove of Garlic into
the oil and added some Black Pepper. I then cubed some firm Tofu and
sliced some fresh mushrooms and put them in the pan to cook for a
while and absorb the flavours.  Once the mushrooms reduced in size
and got shiny from the cooking I poured a drained can of Green Beans
into the sauce pan and cooked for about 10 minutes.  All you really
need to do is let the beens cook up until they are all hot and
steaming, but I usually let them cook a little longer which allows me
to finish preparing the other things I'm making for the meal.

I hope that helps.  It tastes great!
