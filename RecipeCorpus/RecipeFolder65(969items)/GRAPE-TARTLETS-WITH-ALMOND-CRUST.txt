"Take these to a picnic in the pans that they were baked in to prevent
crushing. Assemble them not more than 6 hours before serving time.
For a single 10 inch tarts, bake the crust for 15 minutes with foil
in and a further 20 to 30 minutes empty."

Finely grind almonds in a food processor with on/off motion, or crush
with a rolling pin until as finely ground as possible. Add flour,
salt and brown sugar to processor and blend, or combine ground
almonds, flour, salt and brown sugar in a bowl and stir to blend. Add
butter and process or work with the fingertips until mixture
reassembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl beat egg lightly. Stir in
the vanilla and lemon zest. With a processor on, add egg mixture to
dough through feed tube and process until dough forms. Pat dough into
ball, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for at least 30
minutes. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide into 8 equal
parts. Press each piece into a lightly buttered 3 to 3 1/2 inch
tartlet pan, preferably with removable rim, patting into an even
layer. (The dough will soften as you work with it.) Chill tartlet
shells in freezer for at least 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven
to 400F. remove tartlet shells from freezer, line each with a square
of foil, and fill with pie weights or dried beans to prevent dough
from puffing during baking. bake on baking sheet in center of oven
for 10 minutes. remove foil with weights, reduce oven temperature to
350F, and continue baking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until pastry is a
rich, golden brown. Let tartlet shells cool in pans and place on wire
racks to cool completely. To prevent glaze, combine preserves and
sherry in a small saucepan and warm over medium heat, stirring, until
preserves are melted. strain through a sieve. To assemble tarts,
brush tarts on the bottom of each tartlet shell. arrange grapes, cut
sides down, in a decorative pattern, alternating colors, in the
bottom of each pastry shell. Brush remaining glaze, reheating it if
necessary, over grapes and edges of tartlets. sprinkle toasted
almonds over tartlets before glaze sets. Serve at room temperature.
