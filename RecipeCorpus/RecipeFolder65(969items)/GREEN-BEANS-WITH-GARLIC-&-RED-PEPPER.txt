Categories: Vegetables, Chinese
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Green beans, fresh
2 c  Oil
8    Garlic clove; peeled &
-minced
1    Thai chile; coarsely crumble
1 tb Soy sauce, thin
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Sugar
Trim the beans and cut them into 1-1/2 inch lengths. Make sure that
the beans are quite dry.  If necessary, rub them with a dish towel.

Heat the oil in a wok over a medium high flame.  When smoking hot,
put in all the beans and turn the heat to high. Fry the beans,
stirring now and then, for 1 to 2 minutes or until the skins just
begin to crinkle but the beans are still crisp and bright green. Take
out all the beans with a slotted spoon and put them in a colander
that is resting in a large bowl. Turn off the heat under the wok.

Remove all but four tablespoons oil from the wok. Heat on a medium
flame. When hot, put in the garlic and the Thai chile. Stir and fry
until the garlic turns a light to medium brown color. Put in the
beanas and stir once.  Now put in the soy sauce, salt, and sugar.
Stir again to mix. Serve immediately.
