1 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/3 c  -Water
2 tb Butter
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 pn -Salt
In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine molasses, granulated and brown
sugars and water. Heat to boiling and stir to dissolve sugars. Let
mixture boil, without stirring, until syrup reaches the hard ball
stage (260F/125C) on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat, stir in
butter, baking soda, and salt. Immediately pour onto a buttered
marble slab or baking sheet.
When cool enough to handle, butter hands and gather taffy into a
ball. Pull taffy between hands and continually stretch and fold again
until taffy turned lighter in colour (this can take from 5 to 15
minutes.)
Stretch and twist taffy into a rope about 1 inch thick and cut into
pieces using buttered scissors. Wrap each piece in waxed paper. MAKES:
