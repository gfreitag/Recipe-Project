Title: Flounder Marsala
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Fillets,
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 c  Dry Marsala
1    2 cloves garlic, coarsely
3 T  Vegetable oil
3/4 c  Flour
-freshly ground pepper
3 T  Butter
-chopped
1.  Heat the oil over medium high heat in a heavy skillet 2.  Dip the
fish in the flour and shake off the excess. Quickly brown the fillets
on both sides in the oil.  (Poke with a finger to test for the
springy feel of doneness; this step shouldn't take more than 3 to 5
minutes total.) Remove the fillets to a warm platter and salt and
pepper. 3. Pour off most of the fat, keeping all of the brown
residues. Add the garlic and soften it then add the Marsala and
reduce it while loosening any residues. Add butter and any juices
under the fillets. When the sauce thickens, add the fillets and
reduce the heat to low.  Turn the fillets in the sauce. Transfer to a
platter and serve.
