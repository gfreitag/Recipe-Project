Tortellini alla panna

Tortellini alla panna is a basic of Northern and Central Italian
cuisine.

Tortellini (usually with a cured ham filling, but spinach or other
fillings can go well too. Just don't use those dry tortellini packets
you find on the shelf; choose fresh tortellini, or those you find in
the refrigerated section of the store)

Grated parmesan (enough to make cream thick) Salt Ham, cubed Butter or
Margarine

While you cook the tortellini, mix cream, Parmesan, and salt. Set
aside. When they are almost cooked, melt a little butter or margarine
in a small pan and saute the cubed ham until slighly red, stirring to
keep it from sticking. When tortellini are ready, drain, and mix with
cream mixture. Pour the contents of the ham pan over the tortellini,
and mix. If desired, add some pepper.

NOTES: 1. Add some salt to the water you use to cook the tortellini
in. 2. Freshly grated Parmesan would be preferred. 3. Some people
like to add some cooked green peas 4. The ratio of cream mixture,
ham, and tortellini is up to the cook: some like lots of sauce, some
just a little...

This recipe is used also for tortelloni and ravioli...
