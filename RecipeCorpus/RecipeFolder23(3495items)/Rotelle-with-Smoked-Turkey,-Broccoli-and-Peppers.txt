Rotelle with Smoked Turkey, Broccoli and Peppers

Cook broccoli in large pot of boiling salted water until
criisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer
broccoli to bowl of ice water to cool; reserve water in pot.  Drain
broccoli and pat dry.  Return water to boil.  Add pasta and cook
until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally to
prevent sticking.  Drain thoroughly.

Meanwhile, melt butter with olive oil in heavy large skillet over low
heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and saute until garlic is
tender, about 3 minutes.  Add turkey and saute until heated through
about 4 minutes.

Mix broccoli, pasta, roasted peppers and stock into turkey mixture.
Increase heat to high and cook until pasta has absorbed most of
liquid, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes.  Divide pasta between
plates and serve, passing Romano cheese separately. 2 servings.

Enjoy!
