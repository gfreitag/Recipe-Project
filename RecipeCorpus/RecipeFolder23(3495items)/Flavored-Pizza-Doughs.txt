delicious variations.  Prepare the dough as usual, letting it double
in bulk; punch it down and knead in the flavoring of your choice
until it is well distributed.  Refrigerate the dough for 15 to 20
minutes before stretching or rolling it out or let it go through
another rising before shaping it.

Note: Sometime flavored doughs become sticky after the additional
ingredients have been kneaded in.  If this happens, simply knead in a
small amount of flour until the dough is smooth and no longer sticks."
