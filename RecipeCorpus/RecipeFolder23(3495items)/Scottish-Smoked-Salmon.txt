2 c  Dark brown sugar
-For a 10-to-12-lb salmon

2 T  Cognac or brandy
Scrape or scale the fish. Split through the back into butterfly style
to clean. Cut the head and remove the bones. Salmon smoked according
to the old Scottish method is not washed out. The blood particles may
or may not be washed out. Dry the fillets carefully if washed. Pour
the brandy or cognac over the fill the fillets. Rub well all over
with the salt cure. Lay the fish skin down in in a suitable wooden
box. Rub the cure mixture into the raw flesh and fold the fish with
the cure inside. Place a board on the fish with a 25-to-30 lb
weight.Scottish fishermen would place a "killick"(an anchor weighing
28 lbs) over the salmon fillets to leach the moisture from the fish
tissue and replace it with the salt, thus inhibiting the spoiling
action of ba bacteria. This method is still used today. Hang the fish
in a dry, cool shaded place, spreading it with sticks to permit even
drying, until a filmy skin or pellicle forms. Cold smoke for
approximately 48 hours.
