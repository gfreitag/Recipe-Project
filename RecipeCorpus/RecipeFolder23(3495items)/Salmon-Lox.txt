1 4-5 pound piece of salmon, cut in half and boned; leave the skin on
1/4 cup coarse salt 1/4 cup sugar 2 T peppercorns (preferably white),
crushed or coarsely ground 2 large bunches dill

To cure salmon, put half the salmon, skin side down, in a glass dish.
Combine the salt, sugar, and pepper and sprinkle on the fish,
covering the whole side. Spread the dill over the seasonings. Put the
other half of the fish over the dill, skin side up. Cover with
plastic wrap. Put a smaller dish on top of the salmon and weigh down
with a heavy object. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 days. Turn the salmon
every day. To serve, remove the fish from the marinade. Wipe clean
and pat dry. Slice each side on the diagonal into thin pieces, much
as you would smoked salmon. Serve on half slices of whole wheat
pumpernickel, topped with mustard sauce.
