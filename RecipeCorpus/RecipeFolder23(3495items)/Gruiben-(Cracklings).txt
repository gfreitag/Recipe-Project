The skin.  K.B.] (approx. 5
Cut the bacon into 3/4-inch cubes and put into a tall pot which must
not get filled more than halfway up (to prevent the large amount of
foam during the rendering process from running over and spilling).
Heat up slowly, else the bacon will stick to the bottom and scorch.
As soon as there is a little liquid fat covering the bottom of the
pot, add milk or water, and heat up more, constantly stirring.  Let
the cracklings brown a little bit more, then pour off the liquid
lard, through a sieve, into an earthenware pot.  Warm cracklings are
very popular in-between meal.

Serves 4.
