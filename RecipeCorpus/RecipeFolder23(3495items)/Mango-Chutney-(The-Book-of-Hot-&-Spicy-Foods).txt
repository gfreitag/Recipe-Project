flesh as possible from around pits, without including and fiberous
parts of pits. Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mangos, ginger,
garlic, salt, chili powder, cumin and fenugreek. Cook gently 2
minutes, stirring.

dissolve sugar. Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, 35-40 minutes
or until liquid thickens and becomes syrupy and mangos look
transluscent, stirring frequently. Meanwhile, wash and rinse pint

leaving 1/4" headspace. Release trapped air. Wipe rim of jar with a
clean damp cloth. Attach lid and place in canner. Fill and close
remaining jars. Process 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath. To serve,
garnish with parsley sprig and lemon peel, if desired.
