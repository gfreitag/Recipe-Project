"There's probably no sense in making this soup if you don't like
cauliflower.  As with so much Italian food, this recipe uses a few
basic ingredients to showcase the star vegetable.  A purist would
even shudder at the cheese!  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as
you like but be sure to serve lots of crusty Italian bread or
bruschetta (toasted Italian bread brushed with olive oil).  When I
want a soup with a bit more texture, I remove 1 cup of the cooked
cauliflower, puree it, and return it to the remaining soup"

Break the cauliflower florets into small (1/2 inch) pieces.  Trim the
stem end and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Wash the cauliflower in 2
quarts of cold water blended with 2 tablespoons of vinegar.  Drain
and drop into a large pot of boiling salted water.  Boil for 4
minutes; drain and dry well.

Heat the olive oil in a soup pot; add the garlic and hot pepper, and
cook gently until the garlic is golden.  Add the cauliflower and cook
for 5 minutes, stirring to prevent it from browning.  Add the hot
broth, salt and parsley and cook until the cauliflower is tender.
Ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle with a generous amount of cheese.

Serves 6.
