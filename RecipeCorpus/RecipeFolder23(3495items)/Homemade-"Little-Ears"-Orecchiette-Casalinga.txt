Title: Homemade "Little Ears" Orecchiette Casalinga
Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Lukewarm water
-(approximately)
1 c  Semolina flour
2 c  Unbleached flour
1/4 ts Salt
Source: 'The Good Cook - Pasta' Serves: Makes about 1 1/2 pounds fresh
pasta, or 10-12 oz dried pasta

Combine the semolina, unbleached flour and salt, and mound it on a
large work surface. Make a well in the center with your finger and
pour in 3 - 4 Tbls. water. Begin pulling the flour from the inner
wall of the well into the liquid. Add more water and continue forming
a paste until the flour has absorbed as much water as possible with
becoming hard or dry. The perfect consistency is softer than the
basic flour and egg pasta, but not at all sticky. Knead vigorously on
a lightly floured board until the dough is smooth and elastic. This
may take 20 minutes or so. Form the dough into a ball and cover.

To make the 'little ears', pull off a scant handful of the dough
(keep the rest of the dough covered). On a lightly floured board,
roll the dough into a rope about 3/4 inch in diameter. Cut the rope
into slices no more than 1/8 inch thick to form small circles of
dough. Now put one of these circles into the cupped palm of your hand
and, with the thumb of the other hand, press and turn the circle at
the same time to form a dent in the center that will spread the dough
a little on each side. It should look like a small ear, with slightly
thicker ear lobes. Repeat with all of the remaining dough, placing
the orecchiette on a lightly floured cloth as they are made.

The orecchiette are cooked in the same manner as fresh flour and egg
pasta, although they take longer to cook. Watch them carefully and
taste frequently for doneness.
