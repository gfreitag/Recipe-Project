Categories: Greek, Appetizer, Meat
Yield: 60 servings
1/2 c  Tomato sauce

Karen Mintzias
3 tb Butter or margarine
2    Shallots or onions; minced
1 lb Lean ground lamb or beef
1/2 c  Dry white wine
3    Sprigs fresh parsley;chopped
1 tb Chopped fresh mint or dill
*Note: Suggested cheeses for this recipe are Greek kefalotyri or
Parmesan.

Heat the 3 tablespoons butter or margarine and cook the shallots until
soft, then add the meat and mash with a fork over medium heat until
the color changes.  Add the wine and simmer a few minutes.  Stir in
the herbs and tomato sauce; season with salt and pepper to taste and
simmer for 20 minutes.  Cool.  Add the cheese and egg, and if the
mixture is very liquid, stir in the bread crumbs immediately before
stuffing.

Filo sheets should be unrolled flat, and cut into thirds (3 x 11
inches). Pile up the filo, covering it with waxed paper and a damp
towel.  Take out one sheet at a time and keep the rest covered.
Butter the filo, one sheet at a time, using a pastry brush and the 1
cup melted butter.  Place 1 teaspoon of the meat filling 1 inch from
the end nearest you.  Fold the filo back over the filling so the
bottom edge meets the left edge, forming a right angle. Continue
folding back at right angles to make the triangular shape.  Place on
baking sheets and keep covered until all are ready to bake.  Bake in
a moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden
and crisp, turning once.  Serve hot.
