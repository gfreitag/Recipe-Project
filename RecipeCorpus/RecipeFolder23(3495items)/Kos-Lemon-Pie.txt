MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
Confectioners' sugar; sifted
To make the pastry, sift the flour and confectioners' sugar into a
large cold bowl, stir in the grated lemon zest and salt, and add the
butter. Quickly and lightly rub the mixture together with your
fingers until it resembles coarse meal.  Beat the egg yolks and
vanilla together and stir into the flour mixture.  Pull the dough
together into a ball with your fingers, adding cold water only if
necessary to make a soft dough. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 375 F.

Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the pastry to fit a 9- to
10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  To transfer the pastry,
wrap it around the rolling pin, lift above the pan, and unroll over
the rim.  With your thumb and knuckle, gently press the pastry into
the pan, then roll the rolling pin over the rim to trim the edges.
Line with aluminum foil and bake 6 to 8 minutes or until just set.
Set aside, and lower the oven temperature to 325 F.

To make the filling, beat the butter and honey with an electric mixer
or by hand until pale and creamy.  Beat in the egg yolks one at a
time.  Then stir in the almonds, the juice of 2 lemons (reserve the
zest, removed in thin strips), and the cream.  Pour into the pastry
shell and lightly smooth the top with a spatula.  Bake 30 to 40
minutes, or until golden brown and set.

Meanwhile, combine the superfine sugar, reserved lemon zest, and
water in a sugar pan or small heavy saucepan.  Slowly bring to a
boil, then simmer 6 minutes or until the syrup lightly coats the back
of a metal spoon.  Set aside to cool slightly.

Add the remaining lemon juice to the barely warm syrup and strain,
reserving the zest.  Pour the syrup over the warm pie, remove from
the pan, and liberally sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and the
reserved zest. Serve immediately.

Note: To make the pastry in the food processor, chill the processor
bowl and metal blade in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  Working very
quickly, process the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and butter until the
mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add the egg yolks and vanilla and
pulse just to mix.  (It is unlikely that you will need to add water.)
Wrap and refrigerate.
