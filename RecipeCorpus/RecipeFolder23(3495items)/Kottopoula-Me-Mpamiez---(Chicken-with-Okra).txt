Title: Kottopoula Me Mpamiez   (Chicken with Okra)
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Greek, Chicken
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Butter
1 ea Onion, med., chopped
1 1/2 lb Tomatoes, peeled, strained
2 c  Water
3 lb Cut-up chicken parts (fryer)
Salt  & peper to taste
3 lb Fresh okra
1/2 c  Vinegar
Wash the chickens.  (If they are whole, cut into serving pcs.).
Season lightly with salt & pepper, and set them aside to drain.  Wash
the okra. Remove the stems carefully, without cutting the okra.  Line
them up in a large flat pan and sprinkle with the vinegar; place in
the sun for 30 min to 1 hour.

Brown the butter in a pot, add the chicken, and saute until brown,
then add the onion and let it brown.  Add the tomatoes and boil for 3
to 5 min.
Add water.  Simmer for 30 min.  Add okra and continue to simmer,
covered, until tender.  Watch carefully as this may need a little
more water.  The okra will have absorbed the liquid and only the oil
should remain when the dish is cooked.
