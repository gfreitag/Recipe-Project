Categories: Meat, Potato
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Green pepper; seeded
- and diced
1 md Onion; chopped
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
Commercial sour cream
- or yogurt, for topping
Chopped chives
Crumbled cooked bacon
4 lg Baking potatoes
1/2 c  Diced cooked turkey

1/2 c  Diced cooked ham
1/4 lb Sharp Cheddar Cheese;

1/4 lb Provolone cheese;

Scrub potatoes under cold water and place, wet on a baking sheet. Bake
potatoes at 400 degrees until done, about 1 hour. Let potatoes cool
to the touch. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out pulp,
leaving nice little boats. Divide pulp in half, reserving half for
other use. Put a pat of butter in each shell. Mash remaining potato
pulp and mix with onion, pepper, meat, half the cheese and a spoon or
two of the sour cream. Spoon into each shell, leaving a well in the
middle. Divide remaining cheese into the wells and put a pat of
butter on top. Chill overnight. Heat at 375 degrees until heated
through. Top with sour cream, bacon, and chives and serve with a nice
green salad and a crusty bread.
