This is a recipe from Ken Hom, an author of a number of excellent
Chinese cookbooks. This is a "red-stewed" dish. (No reflection on
Ken's politics..) The sauce can be kept as a "master sauce" and used
over and over again gaining more subtlety and depth the longer you
keep it going. Either freeze it or refrigerate and boil once a week.

Author's note: "This dish is easy to prepare, and can be made ahead of
time. It reheats well and is also very good served cold--prefect for a
dinner party or large gathering."

Fresh ham, about 5 pounds (pork shoulder with bone may be used)

Dry the ham thoroughly with paper towels. Cut the green onions into
3-inch segments

Choose a heavy casserole pot, large enough to hold the ham
comfortably. Heat the pot and then add the oil, ginger, garlic and
green onions, and stir-fry in the pot for 2 minutes. Push the
aromatics to the side and brown the ham on each side until it has
some color, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour off oil.

Add all the braising liquid ingredients to the pot and bring the
mixture to a boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer, cover tightly,
turning the ham from time to time. When the ham is tender, remove it
gently with a large spatula. The meat should be literally falling
apart. Place it on a serving platter.

Strain the sauce, skim off any surface fat and reduce the liquid
until it is slightly thick. Pour this over the ham and serve.

Serves 8 as part of a Chinese meal.
