Categories: Asian, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb White Sesame Seeds, Toasted
- And Ground
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts White Pepper

This chili-red soup is exceptionally hot.  It is said that the time to
serve it is in the hottest months, when the perspiration it induces
has a cooling effect on the diner.  It is equally effective
ammunition against winter cold.

Cut the beef into cubes and place in a saucepan with the water.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1-1/2 to
2 hours until the meat is falling apart.

Mix the chili powder with the sesame oil.  Trim and shred the green
onions. Heat the chili powder and sesame oil in a pan and fry the
green onions with the garlic for 2 minutes.  Add the sesame seeds,
sugar, pepper and soy sauce and fry for 2 to 3 minutes over medium
heat.

Lift out the meat, drain well and toss in the pan for a few minutes.
Return the contents of the pan to the stock and bring to a boil,
simmering until the soup is well flavored.
