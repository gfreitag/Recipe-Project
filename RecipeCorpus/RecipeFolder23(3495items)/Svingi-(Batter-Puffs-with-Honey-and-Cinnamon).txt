Karen Mintzias
1 c  Boiling water
4 tb Butter or margarine
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Grated orange rind
In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the boiling water, butter, salt,
sugar, and orange rind.  Bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, sift together
the flour and baking powder.  Add the dry ingredients all at once to
the hot mixture, beating hard with a wooden spoon over medium heat
until the mixture forms a compact mass and leaves the sides of the
pan.  Remove from the heat and let cool for 1 minute.  Add the eggs,
one at a time, beating hard after each addition; the mixture should
be smooth, glossy, and thick. Heat the oil (which should be 2-1/2 to
3 inches deep) almost to the smoking point, then drop the batter by
tablespoons into the oil, without crowding, to form puffs.  When the
puffs surface, turn them to fry on all sides, using tongs, then lift
them out, drain off excess oil on absorbent paper. Place on warm
platter and keep warm.  If using the syrup, boil the syrup ingedients
for 5 minutes; spoon the syrup, or warm honey, over the puffs,
sprinkle with cinnamon, and serve hot.
