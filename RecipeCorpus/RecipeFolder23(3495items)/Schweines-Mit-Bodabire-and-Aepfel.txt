From Probstried near Kempten

From grandmother's more thrifty times; rarely encountered today.

Brown the pork and then cook it to the point of where it is half
done.  Cut into slices, add the diced potatoes as well as the peeled
and diced apples, and stew in its own juices.  Add a little water
whenever required.

This dish was considered a main course as it contains meat as well as
side dish items.

Serves 4.
