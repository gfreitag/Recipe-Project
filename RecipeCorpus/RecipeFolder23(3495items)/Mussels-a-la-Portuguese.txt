Title: Mussels a la Portuguese
Categories: Seafood, European
Yield: 3 servings
2    Fresh thyme sprigs or
-pinch of dried thyme
2    Bay leaves
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
125 ml Fresh cream
Extra chopped parsley
Lemon quarters
1 1/2 kg Mussels
4    Shallots chopped finely
1    Garlic clove chopped
2 tb Olive oil
3 ts Butter
2/3 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Water
3 ts Finely chopped parsley
Wash the mussels under running water, and remove all traces of mud,
seaweed and barnacles. Remove beards(the rough fury part around the
mussel). If mussel shells are cracked or broken, discard them. If any
mussels are slightly open, tap sharply, and if they don't close,
discard.

Gently fry the garlic and shallots in olive oil and butter until
transparent but not coloured. Add wine, water, parsley, thyme, bay
leaf, pepper and mussels. Pour cream over the top. Cover pan , bring
to boil and steam over a high heat for about 4 minutes, shaking pan
constantly. The shells will open as the mussels cook.

Serve as soon as the shells open. Serve in deep bowls like mixing
bowls, garnished with chopped parsley and lemmon quarters.

Don't forget a large spoon to scoop up the juice.
