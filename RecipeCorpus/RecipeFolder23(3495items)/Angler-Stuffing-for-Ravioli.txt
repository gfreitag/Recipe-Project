Title: Angler Stuffing for Ravioli
Categories: Fish, Pasta
Yield: 1 servings
-olive oil
1 T  Chopped garlic
2 T  Bread crumbs
-salt and pepper to taste
1 lb Angler fillet
1    Yellow onion, chopped
1 T  Chopped parsley
1/2 t  Dried thyme
Chop the fish very fine with a knife or in a grinder or food
processor. If you're using a food processor don't reduce it to a
paste. CAREFUL! You should end with the texture of finely ground
hamburger meat. Saute the onion and garlic in olive oil until soft,
add the remaining ingredients and cook until the angler loses its raw
color.  If the fish gives off a lot of liquid strain it back into the
pan and reduce, adding some more bread crumbs to absorb the liquid,
and then add it back to the stuffing. Season to taste and allow to
cool before filling the pasta.
