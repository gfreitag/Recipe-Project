Title: Browned Onions for Mashed Potatoes
Categories: Potato, Vegetable, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 servings
2 c  Vegetable stock
2 T  Dry white wine or vermouth
Salt and pepper to taste
6 lg Onions, halved and sliced in
... half moons
1 1/2 T  Butter
Combine the onions, butter and stock in a heavy, deep skillet. Cover
and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat slightly and simmer briskly for
10 minutes. Uncover. Simmer for approximately 35 - 40 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until the liquid is almost gone. Cook for a
few more minutes, stirring constantly. The onions will begin to stick
just a bit. Keep cooking and stirring for a few minutes more, using
your wooden spatula to scrape up the browned deposits that form on
the bottom of the skillet. Turn the heat up a bit more and let the
onions begin to burn. Not scorching - just a little gentle burning
and sticking on the bottom of the skillet. Splash in the wine and
boil until it is just about evaporated, stirring and scraping up the
browned bits vigorously. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Remove from the heat.  Serve at once over mashed potatoes. Well
covered it will keep in the refrigerator for days.
