This cinnamon-orange marinade, characteristic of Balkan cooking, is a
specialty of Georgia in south-central Russia.  The tabaka marinade is
usually used with chicken and game hen, but it also goes nicely with
swordfish.

Remove zest of 1 orange and the lemon.  (This is best done using a
vegetable peeler.  Be sure to take only the zest, not bitter white
pith beneath it.)  Juice oranges, lemon and limes.  Combine juice and
zest in bowl. Peel and mince garlic and ginger root. Finely chop
onion. Add garlic, ginger and onion to citrus juices along with
cinnamon, paprika, sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, wine and oil.
Whisk to mix. Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 pounds chicken, game
hens and swordfish.
