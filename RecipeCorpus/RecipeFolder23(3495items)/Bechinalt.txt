Title: Bechinalt
Categories: Poultry, Soup/stew, European
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Flour
4 tb Butter
1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 lb Gizzards
Salt
Pepper, black
Place the gizzards in a saucepan with water to cover (about 2
quarts); salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, and simmer 20
minutes or until the gizzards are done. Drain the gizzards, reserving
the broth, and chop them into bite-sized pieces. Skim the broth. Make
a light roux of the flour and butter, then add the garlic. Bring the
reserved broth back to a boil, then pour about a cup of the boiling
broth into the roux, *stirring constantly.* When the mixture
thickens, gradually pour the rest of the broth into the stew,
stirring constantly. Return the gizzard pieces to the stew, and heat
a few minutes. Serve with challah.
