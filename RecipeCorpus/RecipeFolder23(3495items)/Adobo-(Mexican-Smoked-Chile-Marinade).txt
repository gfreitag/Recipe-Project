This spicy marinade owes its unusual flavor to the chipotle, a smoked
jalapeno chile.  Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste.
Look for them at Mexican and Latin American markets.  Adobo marinade
goes particularly well with pork.

Juice the oranges and lime.  Finely chop chilies and garlic.  Place
citrus juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar
and salt in blender and puree until smooth.

Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken.
