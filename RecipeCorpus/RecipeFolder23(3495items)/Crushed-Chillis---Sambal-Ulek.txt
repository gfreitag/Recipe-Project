2 1/4 lb Red chillis
The ulek-ulek is the implement you use to crush candlenuts, chillis,
etcetera in a cobek. Sambal Ulek is made of chillis that have been
crushed this way. This is a very basic sambal, which is useful to
keep in quantity, so that you can use it for quite a lot of recipes
which specify red chillis as one of the ingredients. As this sambal
can be stored for at least 2 weeks in the refrigerator, it is worth
while making quite a lot of it. But to crush the chillis in a cobek
with the ulek-ulek is very laborious. A food processor is a great
help here.

Seed and chop the red chillis roughly, then put all these into a
saucepan and half-fill the saucepan with boiling water. Boil the
chillis for 8 minutes. Drain, and put them into the food processor,
using the blade for mincing meat. Let the machine run for a minute or
so. For Sambal Ulek you don't want the chilli paste to be too smooth.
Put this sambal into a jar, stir in the salt, cover the jar tightly
and keep in the refrigerator.
