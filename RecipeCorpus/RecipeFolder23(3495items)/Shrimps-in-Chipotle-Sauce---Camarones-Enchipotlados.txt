Jim Vorheis
1 lb Large shrimps, peeled and
-butterflied with tail
Shells left on
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
1/3 c  Light olive oil
1 md White onion, finely sliced
3/4 lb (about 2 medium) tomatoes,
Season the shrimps with salt, pepper, and lime juice and set aside to
marinate for about 30 minutes.

Heat the oil in a frying pan; add the drained shrimp, reserving any
liquid, and sliced onion and fry, shaking the pan and tossing the
ingredients, for about 3 minutes.  Remove shrimp and onion with a
slotted spoon and set aside.

In a blender, blend the tomatoes, chipotles and their liquid, and
garlic to a textured sauce.  Reheat the oil, add the sauce, and fry
over high heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to
prevent sticking, for about 8 minutes.  Add the wine, oregano,
marinade, and salt to taste and cook for another minute.  Add the
shrimp/onion mixture and cook for about 2 minutes ~ the shrimps
should be just cooked and still crisp.
