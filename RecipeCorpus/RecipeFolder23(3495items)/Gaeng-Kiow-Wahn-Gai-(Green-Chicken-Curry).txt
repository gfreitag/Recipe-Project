Title: Gaeng Kiow Wahn Gai (Green Chicken Curry)
Categories: Thai, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Fish Sauce
1 tb Palm or Brown Sugar
1/2 ts Coriander leaves
1/2 c  Basil leaves
3    Red chilis
1    Chicken Breast
2    Chicken Thighs
1/2 c  Coconut Cream
1/4 c  Green Curry Paste
3 c  Coconut Milk
1 1/2 c  Diced Eggplant
1. Bone and skin the chicken breast and thighs, you should have about
1lb of meat. Cut the meat into large, bite sized pieces, and set
aside.

2. In a medium, heavy bottomed saucepan, warm the coconut cream over a
medium heat until it boils gently. Adjust the heat to maintain a
gentle boil and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
The coconut cream will become fragrant as it thickens. When you
see tiny pools of oil glistening on the surface add the curry paste
and stir to dissolve it into the coconut cream. Continue cooking
for
1 to 2 minutes, until the curry paste has a pleasing aroma.

3. Add the chicken pieces and stir fry for 1-2 minutes to coat them
evenly with the paste. Cook for about 2 minutes. Increase the heat
and add the coconut milk, eggplant, fish sauce, sugar and salt and
stir well. Stir in the coriander, adjust the heat to maintain a
gentle
active boil and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste
and adjust the seasoning with a little more fish sauce, sugar, or
curry
paste.

4. When the chicken is done, and the eggplant is just tender, remove
from
the heat and transfer to a serving bowl. Scatter basil leaves,
chopped
chillis and some coriander on the top. Serve.

Preparation in advance:

Prepare it up to the point where you add the coriander, except *DO
NOT* add the eggplant. Cool to room temperature, cover, and
refridgerate for up to 24 hours. To serve bring the curry back to a
gentle boil over a medium heat. Add the eggplant and carry on with
the normal instructions from there.

An alternative to the eggplant is Snow Peas. I personally prefer
them, but both work well.
