"You're ready to invite the gang over for a last-minute party any
time as long as you can pull this favorite from the freezer and pop
it in the oven. Watch them go crazy! (Warning: habit forming!)"

drained, or 2 packages (9 ounces each) frozen   artichoke hearts,
thawed 1 drop hot pepper sauce 1 small garlic clove, minced 1 tsp
lemon juice 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place all the ingredients in a food
processor and blend until smooth. (If using a blender instead of a
food processor, stop the machine frequently and scrape down the sides
of the container with a rubber spatula. First be sure the blades have
stopped completely. Blend just until mixture is smooth.) Coat a 1-1/2
quart baking dish with a nonstick vegetable spray and pour in
mixture. Bake for 30 minutes, until lightly browned. Serve on party
rye bread.

Note: You can also bake this spread in several small baking dishes.
After they cool, cover each one with plastic wrap and freeze them for
later use. When ready to use, thaw, then remove plastic wrap, and
rewarm in the oven or microwave.
