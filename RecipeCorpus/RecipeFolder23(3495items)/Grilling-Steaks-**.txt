1). Prepare the meat by triming the border of fat to a thickness of
1/4". Slash fat at 1" intervals to prevent curling during cooking.
2). If desired, marinate the meat for one hour or more to tenderize
and flavor it. Flavor increases with longer marinating. 3). Season
the meat with pepper, garlic or herbs before placing it on the grill.
Add salt after grilling because it will draw juices from meat during
grilling. 4). Place steak on gas grill over medium heat or on
charcoal grill over medium-high coals. Cook to desired doneness,
using cooking times listed below. For a juicier steak, turn meat only
once and do not pierce with a fork.
