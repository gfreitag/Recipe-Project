Karen Mintzias
1 kg Beef or lamb stew meat
2 tb Oil or butter
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
2    Garlic cloves
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Chopped, peeled tomatoes
1/4 c  Tomato paste
Serves: 5-6 Cooking time: 2 to 2-1/2 hours

Trim meat and cut into 3 cm (1-1/4 inch) cubes.  Heat half the oil or
butter in a heavy pan and brown meat quickly on each side, adding a
single layer of meat to pan at a time.  Remove to a plate when
browned.

Reduce heat, add remaining oil and onion and fry onion gently until
transparent.  Add garlic, celery and carrot and fry for a few minutes
longer.  Add tomato paste, wine, water, cloves, bay leaf and most of
parsley.  Return meat to pan and add salt and pepper to taste and the
sugar.  Cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes for lamb, 1-1/4 hours
for beef.

Wash broad beans well, top and tail, pulling off strings at the same
time. Cut into 8 cm (3-inch) lengths.  Add to yahni, cover pan and
simmer for further 30-45 minutes or until meat is tender.

Put yahni in a serving dish and sprinkle with remaining parsley.
Serve hot with a tossed salad and crusty bread.

Note:  Other vegetables may replace the broad beans; use same quantity
unless otherwise specified.
