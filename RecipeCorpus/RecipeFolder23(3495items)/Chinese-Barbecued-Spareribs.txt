PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 250F. Salt and pepper the pork ribs evenly and
place in a baking dish and cook for 2 hours to render the fat and
tenderize the meat. Remove the ribs from the dish, drain the fat and
set aside. Heat a wok or large frying pan and add the oil. Quickly
add the shallots, scallions, ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for 20
seconds and add the rest of the sauce ingredients. Reduce the heat
and simmer the sauce gently for 15 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool.
(These steps can be done hours ahead or even the night before.) When
you are ready to cook the ribs, smear them with the barbecue sauce.
Make a charcoal fire and, when the coals are ash white, grill the
ribs, basting with any remaining sauce. Cook the ribs for 5-to-10
minutes on each side, depending on thickness. Serve immediately.
