Title: Angu (Cornmeal Mush)
Categories: Nuts/grains, Kids
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Cold water (to 3 cups)
Salt & fresh ground black
-pepper
1/2 c  Fine (stone ground) cornmeal
INGREDIENTS:
1 tb Oil
2    Clove garlic, minced (2 tsp)
1 sm Onion, finely chopped (about
-1/4 cup)
Servings: 6 to 8 Notes: Angu (pronounced "aing goo") is a sort of
polenta, one of the many cooked starch pastes one finds in Brazil.
For best results, use a fine, stone ground cornmeal.

DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Cook the garlic and
onion over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not
brown. Add 2 cups water and bring to a rapid boil.

Add the cornmeal in a thin stream through your fingers, stirring
vigorously to prevent lumps. The mixture should be the consistency of
choux pastry or soft ice cream. If too thick, make a hole in the angu
with a wooden spoon and stir in a little cold water. Reduce the heat
to low and gently simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Correct the seasoning
and serve at once.

Note: For a prettier presentation, the angu can be spooned into a
thickly buttered tube pan and unmolded onto a platter. (Picture in
magazine shows that a fluted tube pan was used, and the center of the
unmolded angu was filled with flat leaf parsley- or cilantro?
