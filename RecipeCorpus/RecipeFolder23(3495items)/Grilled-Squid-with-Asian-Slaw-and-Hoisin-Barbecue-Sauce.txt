If you have bought uncleaned squid, clean it as follows:

Remove the head with the tentacles from the body.  Peel the thin outer
membraned from the body.  Pull the inner cartilage from the body
(This is a single piece that looks like plastic).  Discard but save
the body.  Cut the tentacles off below the eye and remove the hard
pebble-like sphere that remains inside the tentacles.  Reserve the
tentacles.  Wash the body thoroughly.  It should remain in a bag
shape after washing.

Rub the squid with the sesame oil and salt and pepper to taste.  Set
aside while you prepare the slaw.

See Asian Slaw for recipe.
