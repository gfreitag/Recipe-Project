Tortillas Sour Cream-you found it!

Saute onion and garlic in cooking oil until onion is clear.  Add
tomato sauce and simmer a few minutes.  Set aside.

Prepare tortillas-two per serving-as you do for soft tacos.  On
tortilla place pieces of shredded chicken breast and some cut up
green chiles.  Roll up and place folded side down on serving plate.
Spoon hot tomato sauce over enchiladas and top with sour cream.

Soft tortilla | Preparation

In a small frying pan, immerse tortilla in one-half inch of hot (but
not smoking) cooking oil for about thirty seconds, turning once and
then immediately removing to plate with food turner.  Tortilla must
not get crisp but must remain pliable so that it can be easily rolled
up.
