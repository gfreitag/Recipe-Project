Karen Mintzias
2 lb Waxy potatoes
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 lb Onions; thinly sliced
2 tb Wine vinegar
1/2 ts Sugar
Boil the potatoes in their skins in plenty of salted water until just
tender.  Run cold water over them, drain, and leave to cool enough to
handle.

To pickle the onions, place them in a saucepan just large enough to
hold them, pour in the vinegar, and 2 tablespoons water, and sprinkle
with sugar.  Cover the pan and bring to a boil.  Stir, cover, and
simmer for 1 minute.  Shake the covered saucepan and put it aside for
5 minutes to steam.

Peel and slice or roughly dice the potatoes and place in a serving
bowl. Sprinkle with the olives, capers, and pickled onions - with
their juice - olive oil, garlic and parsley.  Toss and season to
taste.
