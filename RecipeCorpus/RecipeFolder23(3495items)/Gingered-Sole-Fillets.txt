Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
5    To 6 drops sesame oil
1 1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger
4 tb Olive oil
4    Green onions, chopped
4    Sole fillets, 4 oz each
1    Egg yolk
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 ts Dry mustard

Wipe sole fillets and place on foil lined broiler pan.  Preheat
broiler. Place next 6 ingredients in a food processor, blender and
process 20 seconds.

Gradually pour in olive oil, processing all the time.  Process 30
seconds until well combined and slightly thickened.  Spread mixture
