Some protein to start the day out right.  Makes enough for you and
baby.

Whip eggs and add the rest of the ingredients.  Put a dab of butter
in a small, heavy frying pan.  Melt over low to medium heat and pour
the eggs in.  Stir constantly until ready.  Mine are usually done
after about 2 minutes. Serves 2-4

*for older babies

**Many young babies prefer the blandness of a processed cheese like
American cheese, even though the unprocessed cheese is better for
them. Slowly introduce the unprocessed and remember to buy the white
or pale yellow kind--no artificial colors.
