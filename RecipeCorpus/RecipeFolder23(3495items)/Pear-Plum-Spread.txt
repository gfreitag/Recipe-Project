Title: Pear-Plum Spread
Categories: Condiment
Yield: 52 servings
1 sm Piece fresh ginger, optional
1    Cinnamon stick 3"
1/2 c  Water
9 ts Artificial sugar = to sugar*
4 md Pears
2 ts Ascorbic acid color keeper
5    Red plums
1 ts Whole cloves
* Recipe suggests 9 aspartame tablets crushed.  Liquid sweetener would
require 2 1/4 tsp (my note).

Peel and core pears; chop coarsely.  Place in a large saucepan and
sprinkle with ascorbic acid color keeper.  Remove pits from plums and
cut each plum into 8 pieces.  Stir plums into pears.

Wrap plum pits, cloves and ginger, if desired, in a piece of
cheesecloth and place under some of the fruit.  Add cinnamon stick
and water.

Cover, bring to a boil and simmer 15 to 20 min or until fruit is
tender. Discard spice bag and cinnamon stick.  Puree fruit mixture in
a blender or food processor or press through a sieve.

Return to saucepan.  Simmer, uncovered 15 to 20 min or until mixture
coats a metal spoon.

Remove from heat.  Stir in sweetener.  Ladle into hot clean jars
leaving 1/2 inch headspace.  Wipe jar rims, seal.  Process 10 min in
a boiling water bath.  Store in a cool, dark, dry place.

Processing may be omitted if spreads are to be used within a short
period of time.  Store in the fridge up to 1 month or freezer up to 3
months.
