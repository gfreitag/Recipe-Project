The Turks' appreciation of the fair sex is apparent even in the
naming of recipes.  Form the meat mixture with a certain
voluptousness to an elongated egg shape.  Don't make them too plump -
we all like to be flattered, don't we?

Cooking time: about 20-25 minutes in all

Combine meat, boiled rice, onion and cheese, then pass through meat
grinder using fine screen.  Add herbs, salt and pepper to taste and 1
lightly beaten egg.  Mix by hand to a smooth paste.

Take a generous tablespoon of the mixture and form into an elongated
egg shape, wider at one end than the other, or into simpler torpedo
shape. Moisten hand with water to facilitate handling.  Place kadin
budu into baking dish side by side as they are finished.

Beat remaining egg well and pour over kadin budu, then turn them over
in a dish to coat them evenly with a film of egg.

Place about 1/2 cup flour in a plate and roll budu in flour, one at a
time, placing them into a frying pan of heated oil as they are
coated. Use one hand for rolling them in the flour, keep other hand
dry for moving them to the pan.

Fry over high heat until golden brown, turning them frequently with
tongs so that they keep their shape.

Drain on paper towels and serve hot with vegetable or salad
accompaniment.
