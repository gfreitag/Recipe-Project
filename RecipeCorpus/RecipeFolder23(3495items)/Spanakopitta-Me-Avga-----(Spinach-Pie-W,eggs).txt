Title: Spanakopitta Me Avga
Categories: Vegetable, Main dish, Greek
Yield: 6 servings
Salt & pepper to taste
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
5 ea Egg
3/4 lb Phyllo pastry
Melted butter as needed
1/2 lb Feta cheese, crumbled
3 lb Spinach
1 ea Onion, med., chopped
1/2 c  Scallions, chopped
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Dill, chopped
1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
Wash spinach in plenty of water and cut in sm. pcs.; place in
bowl. Salt lightly; stir to spread salt evenly.  Take spinach, a
handful at a time, and squeeze out the excess water; place it in
another bowl.  Saute the onion in half the butter until it is a
light, golden color; add the scallions and cook untill they wilt.
Add spinach; stir until all vegs. take on a light color.  Stir in the
dill, parsley, salt and pepper; cover the pot and cook until all the
water thrown off by the spinach is absorbed. Remove from the heat;
turn into a bowl, and immediately add the milk (to cool the spinach).
Beat the eggs in another bowl and add the cheese to them; add to the
cooled spinach; mix well.

Line a pan with 8 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each sheet with
the melted butter before topping it with the next sheet.  Do not trim
the overhanging sections.  Pour in the spinach mixture, spreading it
evenly over the phyllo.  Fold the part of the phyllo that extends out
of the pan back over the filling.  Lay the remaining phyllo on top,
again brushing each sheet with melted butter before adding the next.
Now trim the overlap.  Brush additional melted butter on top of the
pie and score it into square or diamond-shaped serving pcs.  Bake for
30 to 45 min. in a preheated 300 F. oven; let it stand for 30 min.
before serving.

NOTE:  This can also be made without precooking the spinach.  In
that case, squeeze the spinach free of as much water as possible, mix
it with the seasonings, and proceed as above, baking it for 1 hr.
