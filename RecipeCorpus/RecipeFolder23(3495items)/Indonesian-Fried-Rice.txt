into as smooth a paste as possible. Set a wok or skillet over
medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil and spice paste; gently
brown. Turn heat to high and add the shrimp; stir-fry until they turn
bright orange, about 30 seconds. Remove and set aside. Add bell
peppers, peas and cabbage; stir-fry until vegetables are cooked but
still crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add rice; stir-fry together,
breaking up the lumps of rice. When the rice grains are separated,
add tamarind water, ketjap manis, light soy sauce, green onions,
chicken, barbecued pork and reserved shrimp; mix together. Check for
seasonings. Transfer to a serving plate, garnish with coriander and
arrange the cucumbers around the edge.
