MMMMM--------------------------CHICKEN-------------------------------
1 bn Chives
4    Garlic cloves; finely minced
1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
8    Chicken breasts, boned and
- skinned
1 c  Slivered almonds
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/4 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Grated lemon peel, or:
- finely minced lemon peel
1/2 c  Lemon juice
6 tb Sugar
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
1 c  All-purpose flour
4 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Cooking oil
Salt and pepper
ADVANCE PREPARATION: Dip each chicken breast in water and then gently
flatten with a meat pounder or rolling pin until the breast increases
in size by about one-third.  Set aside.

Toast the almonds in a 325 F oven until light golden, then set aside.
Mince the chives and set aside.  Combine the garlic and ginger and
set aside. In a small bowl combine the sauce ingredients and mix well.

LAST-MINUTE COOKING: Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of
cold water.  Preheat the oven to warm.

Place a small noncorrosive skillet or saucepan over medium heat.  Add
1 tablespoon cooking oil and then garlic and ginger.  Saute briefly,
then add the sauce.  Bring to a low boil and reduce the heat to
simmer.

Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with a little salt and pepper.
Dust with flour, shaking off any excess.  Place a 12-inch skillet
over high heat.  When hot, add the butter and remaining 3 tablespoons
of oil. When the butter bubbles, pan-fry 3 or 4 chicken pieces at a
time.  Cook for about 1 minute on each side.  The chicken is done
when the meat turns color and feels firm to the touch (do not
overcook).  Transfer the chicken to a heated platter or dinner plates
and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining chicken.

Bring the sauce back to a low boil and stir in a little of the
cornstarch mixture to lightly thicken it.  Spoon the sauce over the
chicken. Sprinkle the almonds and chives on top.  Serve at once.
