1 c  Honey
1 ts Fresh lemon peel; grated
1 c  Chicken stock
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
11 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Flour
1 c  Slivered almonds
2 tb Prudhomme's Seafood Magic
1 c  Celery; chopped
In small saucepan over medium heat, melt 3 tbls butter. Whisk in flour
until smooth, about 1 minute. Set aside. In 10" skillet over high
heat, melt remaining 8 tbls butter. When it comes to a hard sizzle,
add almonds, Seafood Magic and celery. Cook, stirring frequently at
first and constantly near end of cooking time, about 8 minutes or
until almonds are browned. Stir in honey and cook, stirring
frequently, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon peel and stock. Cook,
stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add nutmeg; cook 3 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Whisk in reserved butter mixture until it is
incorporated and sauce is slightly thickened, 30-60 seconds. Remove
from heat.

NOTE: Excellant on grilled seafood, chicken or pork. Brush it on right
before meat is ready to come off the grill and bring some to the
table for dipping.
