Title: Sima - Finnish May Day Drink - Pronounced (See-Mah)
Categories: Beverage, European
Yield: 24 servings
1/3 c  Dark corn syrup;optional
1/4 ts Dry yeast
Raisins
10 qt Water;fresh pure
2    Lemons;fine
2 1/2 c  Brown sugar
2 1/2 c  White sugar
Shave the yellow peel from the lemons, cutting very thinly so that as
little of the white underlayer as possible is attached. Set the yellow
slices aside. Then peel the bitter white underlayer off and discard
it. Slice the lemons into very thin slices. Place them into a
container and cover them so they don't dry out.
Boil the water in a large kettle. Remove it from the heat and stir in
the yellow lemon peel, the sugars, and the syrup. When the sugars have
dissolved, cover the kettle and let the contents cool to room
temperature (25'C or 75'F). Then add the lemon slices and the yeast.
Leave it to stand overnight.
Place 4-5 raisins and a teaspoon of white sugar in the bottom of each
of several clean bottles (wine or soda pop). Pour the sima into the
bottles, straining it through a sieve to remove the lemon. Cap the
bottle tightly.
The sima will be ready to drink when the raisins rise to the top of
the bottles, about 3-7 days depending on the temperature of the room
where they are stored. Serve it well chilled.
