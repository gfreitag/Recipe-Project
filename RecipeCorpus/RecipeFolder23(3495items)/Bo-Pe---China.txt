Title: Bo-Pe - China
Categories: Chinese, Appetizer
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Sugar
Dough:
1    Package yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water
4 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
2 tb Melted shortening
Sift the flour, sugar and salt together in a large bowl and hollow
out the center.  Pour the yeast which has been dissolved in the warm
water into the hollow.  Add the melted shortening and mix well
together.

Knead lightly on a floured board until the dough is smooth and
elastic. Then place in a greased bowl, cover with a sheet of waxed
paper and set to rise at room temperature about 3 hours.

Oil your hands and the board with salad oil and divide the dough into
24 small workable portions. Press out with the hands and then roll
with rolling pin until each piece is about 4 inches in diameter.

Drop good full tablespoons of filling (recipe follows) onto each
piece of dough, then draw up the edges around the filling and make
into a ball. Press the edges together and turn so the seams are
underneath. Let rise double.

These can be baked or fried or steamed on a rack.  However you choose
to cook them, they are very delicious.
