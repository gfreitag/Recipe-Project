Title: Sadza (Corn Porridge)
Categories: African, Condiment
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/2 c  White cornmeal
Stephen Ceideburg
4 c  Water
Bring 3 cups of the water to a boil in a large pot.

Combine 1 1/2 cups of the cornmeal with the remaining 1 cup water.
Reduce heat to medium-low and add the cornmeal mixture to the boiling
water, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Cook for about 5
minutes, slowly adding the remaining cup of cornmeal.

When the mixture is very thick and starts to pull away from the sides
of the pan, transfer to a serving bowl or plate. Use a wooden paddle
or spoon to compress the mixture into a round shape (you may use wet
hands to aid in the procedure).

Serves 6.
