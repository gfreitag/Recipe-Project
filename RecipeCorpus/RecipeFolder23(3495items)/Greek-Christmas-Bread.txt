Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Combine the sugar, cardamom,
salt, egg, milk and oil in a large bowl.  Mix well.  Add the yeast
mixture, flours, raisins and nuts. Mix well. Add enough extra flour
to make soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Shape into a round
loaf.

Put the dough into a lightly-oiled 8-inch-round cake pan.  Cover with
a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour. Bake in a 350-degree oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until
brown.
