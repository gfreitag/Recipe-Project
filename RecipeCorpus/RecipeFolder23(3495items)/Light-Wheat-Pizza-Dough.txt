Title: Light Wheat Pizza Dough
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Cornmeal, preferably stone
-ground
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Olive oil
1    Env active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
3 1/4 c  Unbleached flour (approx.)
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water; stir to
combine. Let stand for 5 minutes.

With a wooden spoon, beat in 1 1/2 cups of the unbleached flour, the
whole wheat flour, and the cornmeal.  Beat vigorously for 1 minute.
Cover with plastic wrap.  Set the sponge aside in a warm, draft-free
place for 10 minutes.

Stir in the salt and olive oil.  Add the remaining unbleached flour,
1/2 cup at a time until you have a soft, kneadable dough.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead vigorously
for 8 minutes, using sprinkles of flour to prevent sticking.  You
should have a soft, smooth, and elastic dough.  Place the dough in a
lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat; cover.  Set aside in a warm,
draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Makes enough dough for one large pizza.
