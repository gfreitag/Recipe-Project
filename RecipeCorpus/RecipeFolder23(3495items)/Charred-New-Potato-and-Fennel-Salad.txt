Categories: Salad, Potato
Yield: 6 servings
Freshly ground pepper
1/3 c  Pitted Nicoise olives;
- chopped
1/3 c  Green onions; chopped
6    Or 7 tb red wine vinegar
2 lb Small red potatoes;
- washed
2 md Fennel bulbs; trimmed,
- quartered lengthwise
1/2 c  Light-tasting olive oil
Salt
Preparation time: 25 minutes.  Cooking time: 25 minutes.

1.  Set broiler rack about 6 inches from heat.  Turn on broiler.

2.  Toss potatoes and fennel in 1/4 cup olive oil; reserve any extra
oil. Spread in single layer on broiler pan. Lightly season with salt
and pepper. Broil until blistered and slightly blackened, turning
once, about 5 minutes per side.  Bake in 400-degree oven until just
tender, about 15-20 minutes. Do not overcook potatoes.

3.  When cool enough to handle, cut potatoes and fennel into 1/2-inch
dice. Toss with all oil, 6 tablespoons vinegar and remaining
ingredients. Season to taste. Add remaining tablespoon vinegar if
needed. Can be made several hours ahead and kept at room temperature
or a day ahead and refrigerated, covered airtight. Let come to room
temperature before serving. Adjust seasoning.

'This salad would be a great accompaniment to any grilled meat or
poultry. Try to make it several hours or a day ahead so the flavors
have a chance to deepen and meld together.'
