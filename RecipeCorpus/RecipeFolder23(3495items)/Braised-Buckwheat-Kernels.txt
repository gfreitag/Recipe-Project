Braised Buckwheat Kernels

Popular in Russia where it's called Kasha, this hearty style side
dish is prefect for a hurry-up meal. (Sue's note: This stuff is
good!!)

Mix buckwheat kernels and egg in ungreased 10-inch skillet. Cook over
medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until kernels are seperated and
brown. Stir in remaining ingredients; reduce heat.

Cover and simmer about 5 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and
buckwheat kernels are tender. Makes 6 servings.
