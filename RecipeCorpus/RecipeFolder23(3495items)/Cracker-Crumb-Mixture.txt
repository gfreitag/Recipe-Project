This rich crumb topping keep well on the pantry shelf or in the
refrigerator.  Halve the recipe if you use crumbs sparingly.

Whirl the crackers in a food processor or put them through a food
grinder until they are evenly ground but retain some texture. Saute
the onions in 2 tablespoons of the butter, then add to the crumb
mixture along with the remaining butter, parsley and thyme. Mix
thoroughly. If the mixture hardens in the regrigerator, place it in
the oven on low heat for a few minutes before using. (Makes about 9
cups) ___- from The Legal Sea Food Cookbook
