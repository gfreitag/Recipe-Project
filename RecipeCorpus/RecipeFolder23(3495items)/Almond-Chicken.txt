Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
6    Green onions
3    Stalks celery
8    Fresh mushrooms, sliced
3 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Blanched whole almonds
(about 3 ounces)
1 ts Grated, fresh ginger root
1/2    Drained, sliced bamboo shoos
1 1/2 c  Water
4 tb Dry sherry, or rice wine
4 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Instant chicken bouillon
4    Whole chicken breasts
1    Egg white
1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Carrot
1. Combine water, 2 tablespoons of the sherry, 1 1/2 tablespoons of
the cornstarch, the soy sauce and bouillon in small saucepan.  Cook
and stir over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 5
minutes. Keep warm.

2. Remove skin and bones from chicken.  Cut chicken into 1 inch
pieces. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sherry, 1 tablespoon
cornstarch, egg white and salt.  Mix in chicken pieces.

3. Pare carrot and dice.  Cut onions into 1-inch pieces.  Cut celery
diagonally into 1/2-inch slices.

4. Heat oil in wok over high heat until it reaches 375 degrees F.  Add
chicken pieces, one at a time, to hot oil (cook only 1/3 of the
pieces at a time).  Cook until light brown, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain on
absorbent paper. Repeat with remaining chicken.

5. Remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from wok.  Stir-fry almonds in
the oil until golden, about 2 minutes.  Drain.

6. Add carrot and ginger to wok.  Stir-fry 1 minute.  Add all
remaining vegetables.  Stir-fry until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
Mix in chicken, almonds and sauce.  Stir-fry until hot.
