buy a 1/4 or 1/2 lb. of several items.  Even if shrimp is $6 per lb.
1/4 lb. is affordable and will add flavor and variety.

Chopped parsley for garnish

Saute the leeks, onions, celery, garlic and mushrooms until the
onions are clear. Add the stock, nectar or water, tomato sauce and
white wine. Bring to a heavy simmer and taste. Add the cayenne pepper
and salt to taste.

Prepare the seafood and add to the pot, remembering to add first those

the shells on.

Simmer until done. Serve in large bowls over spaghetti. By adding
extra fish such as a lobster per person this will become a meal
instead of a soup.
