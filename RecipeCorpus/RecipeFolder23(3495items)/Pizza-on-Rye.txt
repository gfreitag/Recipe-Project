Title: Pizza on Rye
Categories: Pizza, Kids
Yield: 6 servings
5    Or 6 slices of rye toast
8 oz Sliced mozzarella cheese
Parmesan cheese
8 oz Tomato sauce
1/4 ts Basil
1/8 ts Oregano
Mix the tomato sauce, basil and oregano and spread on 5 or 6 slices
of rye toast.  Divide the 8 ounces of sliced mozzarella among the
pizzas. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and broil until bubbly. For
variety, I top my pizza with onions, pepperoni, and sometimes canned
shrimp.
