Chop the almonds finely.  Prepare the fish, wash and dry and then
soak in milk for 5-10 minutes.  Toss in seasoned four.  Melt half the
butter in the frying pan, and fry the fish for 5-7 minutes on each
side. Make the sauce by melting the rest of the butter, adding the
chopped almonds. Saute for a few minutes.  Then add the honey and

Pour over the fried fish, and serve garnished with lemon.
