Karen Mintzias
1    Onion; chopped fine
3 tb Butter
1 lb Lean ground beef
1    Garlic clove
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1 lb Canned, peeled tomatoes*
*Note: Tomatoes should be drained and chopped. In a heavy saucepan
cook the onion in a little water over medium heat until softened,
then add the fat and cook the onion until translucent. Combine the
ground beef with the onion, mashing with a fork and stirring until
the raw color disappears. Add the garlic and wine, then cover and
simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, the tomato paste, sugar,
cinnamon stick, bay leaf, salt and pepper to taste, then simmer,
covered, for 30 minutes longer. Add the parsley and basil during the
last 10 to 15 minutes. Cook uncovered for the last few minutes, to
allow excess liquid to evaporate; the sauce should be thick.  Remove
the cinnamon stick before serving. Makes 4 cups. From "The Food of
Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.
