Title: Homemade Red Chile Potato Chips
Categories: Potato
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CHIPS--------------------------------
1 qt To 2 quarts peanut or
- canola oil, for frying
2    To 3 (about 1 lb) Idaho
- baking potatoes
MMMMM-----------------------CHIP SEASONING----------------------------
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pure red chile powder
1/2 ts Cayenne chile powder
Note: Idaho russet baking potatoes make the best chips, as they are
high in moisture and low in sugar.

1. Peel and slice the potatoes paper-thin with a mandolin or in a food
processor. Soak the sliced potatoes in ice-cold water 5 minutes. (You
can slice the potatoes ahead of time and hold them in water as long
as 4 or 5 hours.) Drain in a salad spinner or lay flat on kitchen
towels and pat dry.

2. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350 degrees.
Meanwhile, thoroughly combine all the chip seasoning ingredients in a
bowl. Fry the potatoes in batches until crisp and brown. Remove with
a slotted spoon or use a spoon and strainer, and drain on paper
towels.

3. Transfer to a large bowl and toss chips with chip seasoning while
still warm.

Serving suggestions: For best results, serve immediately. Good with
burgers, sandwiches, or with eggs and chorizo for breakfast or brunch.
Storage: Can be stored in a cool, dry place two to three days, or up
to one week in dry climates.
