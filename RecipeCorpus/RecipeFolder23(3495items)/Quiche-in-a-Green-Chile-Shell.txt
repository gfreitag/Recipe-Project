before using. ** There should be about 1 cup of the shredded
Monterey Jack Cheese. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously
grease a 9-inch pie plate 1 1/4-inches deep. Cook and stir the
sausage in a skillet until done; drain on paper toweling. Cut a
lengthwise slit in each chile and open them up. Arrange on the bottom
and sides of the pie plate forming a shell. Sprinkle with the cheese
and sausage. Beat the eggs slightly and then beat in the milk and
pepper. Pour the mixture into the chile-line pie plate. Bake,
uncovered, until a knife inserted halfway between the center and the
edge comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes
before cutting.
