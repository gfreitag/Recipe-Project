1 lb Macaroni; cooked & drained
8 tb Butter or margarine; melted
3    Eggs; lightly beaten
1/2 c  Grated cheese
1 1/2 c  Feta cheese, cubed
In a large bowl, combine the macaroni, one-third of the melted
butter, the eggs, grated cheese, and feta.  Season with salt, white
pepper, and nutmeg and mix with a wooden spoon.  In a buttered 9 x 12
x 3-inch baking pan, spread the macaroni-cheese mixture over the filo
and cover with the 6 remaining sheets of filo, brushing butter
between each and on the surface. Using the tip of a sharp knife,
score the top 3 to 4 sheets to indicate 12 servings.   Bake in a
moderate oven (350 F) for 30 minutes, or until the surface is crisp.
Remove to a rack for 10 minutes, then cut and serve on a warm platter.
