Title: Jar Yue Har Guen (Deep-Fried Fish and Prawn Rolls)
Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Finely grated fresh ginger
1/2 ts Salt
Plain flour
Dry breadcrumbs
Oil for frying
12    Raw prawns
500 g  (1 lb) fish fillets (see
-note)
1    Egg, beaten with 1 Tb.
-water
Shell and de-vein prawns.  Using a sharp knife, skin the fish fillets.
Depending on the size of the fillets, they may be cut into two, three
or four strips. Wrap each strip around a prawn and fasten with a
wooden toothpick. Mix egg with ginger and salt.  Dip fish rolls into
plain flour, then into beaten egg and finally into breadcrumbs.

Heat about half cup oil in wok.  When it starts to form a haze add
fish rolls, about 6 at a time.  Fry until golden brown all over,
approximately 3 minutes.  Drain on absorbent paper. Fry remaining
rolls. Serve hot with soy or chilli sauce for dipping. Note: Choose
flat fillets of firm white fish. They should be thin, for they have
to be rolled around the prawns.
