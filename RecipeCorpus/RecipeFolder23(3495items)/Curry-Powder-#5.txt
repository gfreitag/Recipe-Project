Title: Curry Powder #5
Categories: Indian, Condiment, Curries
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Ground Cardamom
2 tb Garlic Salt
2 tb Ground Poppy Seeds
2 1/2 tb Ground Dried Chilis
2 1/2 tb Ground Black Pepper
1 tb Ground Ginger
1/4 c  Ground Cinnamon
2 1/2 tb Ground Coriander
2 1/2 tb Ground Tumeric
3 tb Ground Cumin
1 tb Ground Fenugreek

Sprinkle often with vinegar while blending these spices.  This powder
may be sealed tightly and stored for many months, but it will not
give the same rich flavour as powders using whole spices and freshly
ground.

NOTE:  A good basic blend from ready-ground spices.
