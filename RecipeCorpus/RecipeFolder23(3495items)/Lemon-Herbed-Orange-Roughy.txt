1/2 t  Grated fresh lemon peel
1    Green onion, thinly sliced

Heat olive oil or butter in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over mdm-high
heat. Add herbs and garlic and stir about 30 seconds. Pour in wine
and lemon juice.  Add fillets and spoon liquid over top. (If cooking
frozen fillets, add to liquid then cover and bring to simmer. Cooking
time will be just a few minutes longer,

depending upon thickness and temperature of fish.)  Sprinkle fish

with pepper and lemon peel, then onions.  Cover and simmer until fish
turns opaque in center; cut into thickest part of fillet to test.
This should take 7 to 9 minutes for a 3/4- to 1-inch thick

fillet.  Transfer fish to a platter and cover to keep warm. Increase
heat to high and boil liquid until reduced to 2 to 3 tbs, 1 to 2
minutes. Pour sauce over fish.  Garnish with lemon slice and sprig of
fresh herb.
