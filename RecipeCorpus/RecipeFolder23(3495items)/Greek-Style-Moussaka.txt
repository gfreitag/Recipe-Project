Title: Greek Style Moussaka
Categories: Lamb, Greek, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
Freshly ground pepper
1/4 lb Butter
6 tb Flour
1 qt Milk
4    Eggs; beaten until frothy
Grated nutmeg
2 c  Ricotta or cottage cheese
1 c  Fine bread crumbs
1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
3 md Eggplants
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3 lg Onions; chopped fine
2 lb Ground lamb; (or beef)
3 tb Tomato paste
1/2 c  Red wine
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
Salt
Peel the eggplants and cut them into slices about 1/2 inch thick.
Brown the slices quickly in 1/4 cup of the oil. Set aside. Heat the
remaining oil in the same skillet and cook the onions until they are
brown. Add the ground meat and cook 10 minutes. Pour off excess fat.
Combine the tomato paste with the wine, parsley, cinnamon, salt and
peper. Stir this mixture into the meat and simmer over low heat,
stirring frequently, until all the liquid has been absorbed. Remove
the mixture from the fire. Preheat the oven to 375F. Make a white
sauce by melting the butter and blending in the flour, stirring with
a wire whisk. Meanwhile, bring the milk to a boil and add it
gradually to the butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly. When the
mixture is thickened and smooth, remove it from the heat. Cook
slightly and stir in the beaten eggs, nutmeg and ricotta. Grease an
11x16-inch pan and sprinkle the bottom lightly with crumbs. Arrange
alternate layers of the eggplant and the meat sauce in the pan,
sprinkling each layer with Parmesan and crumbs. Pour the ricotta
sauce over the top and bake 1 hour, or until top is golden. Remove
from the oven and cool 20 to 30 minutes before serving. Cut into
squares and serve. The flavors in this dish really improve if you
make it a day ahead.
