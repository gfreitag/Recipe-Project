1 c  Oil For Deep-Frying
4 oz Dried Green Jalapeno Peppers

This dip will give any food a much richer taste, and add spiciness.

~-- Heat a small pan with the oil and deep-fry the dried peppers,
shallots and garlic until dark brown.  Place the fried ingredients
with all the others in a blender, and process until a smooth mixture
forms.

Pour the entire mixture into a medium skillet and fry on medium heat
for 5 minutes.  Remove, cool, and place in a jar with a tight fitting
lid and use as needed.  It will keep indefinitely.
