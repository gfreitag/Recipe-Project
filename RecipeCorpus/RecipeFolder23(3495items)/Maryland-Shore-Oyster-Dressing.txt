1. Drain the oysters and reserve the liquor. If the oysters are
large, cut them in half with sharp scissors. Set aside. 2. Heat the
water and 2 tbs of the butter in a heavy saucepan and add the celery,
shallots or scallions, and chopped pepper. Simmer over medium heat
until the shallots are limp and the vegetables have absorbed the
butter. They must not sizzle or brown the least bit. 3. Add the
remaining butter, the parsley, thyme or tarragon, bread crumbs, and
oysters. Cook over medium heat, mixing lightly with a fork, only
until the oysters curl. Add the oyster liquor as needed; the dressing
should be moist but not wet. 4. Season with salt, white pepper, and
cayenne. Makes about 3 cups
