Categories: Asian, Salad
Yield: 4 servings
1    Onion, chopped finely
2    Garlic cloves, sliced finely
1 ts Tumeric
1 ts Sugar
2 ts Salt or to taste
1 lg Cucumber
1/2 c  Cider vinegar, or: White
1/2 c  - Wine

First peel the cucumber & cut into 2 inch pieces. Cut these again into
lengthwise sticks. Now put them into a pan with the vinegar and salt;
add a little water to cover, heat and simmer for a few minutes until
the cucumber is slightly tender and transparent. Drain, keeping the
liquid, and let cool. Set aside. Now toast the sesame seeds in a pan
with a little oil until they begin to jump & turn golden. Then let
them cool. After this, heat 1 Tbsp of the oil in a pan and cook the
onion and the garlic without burning until they are golden brown.
Remove them from the pan and let cool. Now pour the remaining oil,
tumeric, sugar and half the drained vinegar liquid. Stir this over a
gentle heat until the sugar is dissolved. Add the onion and garlic
and heat them through. Arrange the cucumber pieces in a salad bowl
and pour over the dressing. Mix well and then scatter the sesame
seeds on top. Serve warm or cold.
