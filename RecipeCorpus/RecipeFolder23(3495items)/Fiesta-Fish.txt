Fiesta Sauce: 3 Tbl olive oil 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 medium
onion, chopped 1/2 tsp fennel seeds 1 fennel bulb, chopped (reserve
feathery foliage) 1/2 red bell pepper, chopped 1/3 cup fresh orange
juice 3 Tbl dry vermouth Salt and pepper Crushed dried red chile
pepper (optional) 3-4 Tbl chopped fennel foliage

Lightly oil a broiler pan that will hold fish. Drizzle each fillet
with olive oil and orange juice, and sprinkle both sides with salt
and pepper, paprika, and crushed red chile pepper. Place the orange
slices and red pepper slices on the bottom of the pan, reserving 4 of
each for serving plates. Place fish skin- side down on top of the
orange and red pepper slices. To make the sauce: heat 3 Tbl olive oil
in a large saute pan. Saute the garlic, onion, fennel seeds, and
chopped fennel bulb for about 4 minutes. Add the chopped red pepper,
and saute 3 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and saute another
3 minutes. Place fish under the broiler 4 inches from heat. Broil
approximately 5 minutes (do not turn) or until fish flakes when
tested with a fork. Spoon some sauce over fish the last 2 minutes of
broiling, and/or serve fish with sauce on the side. Serve each fillet
with a slice of orange an;d red pepper ring. Serves 4. Note: The
sauce also makes a delicious stuffing for a whole baked red snapper
marinated in olive oil, orange juice, and vermouth.
