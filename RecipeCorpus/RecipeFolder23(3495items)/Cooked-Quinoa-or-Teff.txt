Title: Cooked Quinoa or Teff
Categories: Nuts/grains
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Water
1/4 ts Salt, optional
Ingredients:
1 c  Quinoa or 1/2 cup teff
Servings: 4

Directions:

Quinoa only: measure into a saucepan half full of cold water.  Swish
quinoa briskly with your hand, then pour it into a fine strainer to
drain. Repeat two or more times, until your water runs clear and
doesn't foam when agitated.  Drain again.

Bring quinoa or teff, water and salt to a boil.  Reduce heat and
simmer, covered, for 15 to 20 min, until the water is absorbed.
Remove from heat, and cover for 5 min more.

Note: Add quinoa or teff to soups in either of two ways: 1) Add them,
uncooked to the pot a half hour before serving time 2) Add them cooked
(left-over) to the pot 10 min before serving. (If frozen, allow 20
min.)
