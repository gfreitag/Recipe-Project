Title: Salad Frisee
Categories: Salad, French
Yield: 2 servings
1/3 lb Slab bacon
- cut into 1/2-inch cubes
12    Cubes French bread (1/2")
-(crusts removed)
3 c  Chicory leaves
- torn into 2-inch pieces
1 sm Shallot
1 tb Dijon mustard
1 1/2 tb Red wine vinegar
5 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
This is based on a classic French salad served at Quatorze Restaurant
in New York.

IN A SMALL BOWL, combine the shallot, mustard and vinegar. Mix well
then slowly whisk in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and
set aside. In a small heavy skillet, saute the bacon over medium heat
until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted
spoon and set aside. Add the cubes of bread to the skillet and saute
until brown on all sides, 5 minutes. Return the bacon to the skillet,
and heat it rapidly with the croutons, stirring constantly, until
very hot. Remove the pan from the heat and quickly stir in the salad
dressing, mixing well. (Take care, it may splatter). In a salad bowl,
combine the chicory with the hot dressing, bacon and croutons,
tossing quickly. Serve at once.
