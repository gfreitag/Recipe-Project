Title: Lobster, Normandy Style (Homard a la Normande)
Categories: Seafood, French
Yield: 4 servings
12 c  Calvados
3 c  Heavy cream
3 tb All purpose flour
1/2    Lemon, juice of
1 ds Cayenne pepper
2 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
4    Fresh lobsters, live
1/2 c  Sweet butter
Salt
Freshly ground white pepper
1/2 c  Finely chopped shallots or
-scallions
Servings: 4

Split the lobsters lengthwise with a big knife and break the shells
off the claws with a hammer or a cleaver. Pour the liquid and the
tomalley (the liver) into a small bowl. Discard the stomach (the
small sac which is behind the eyes).

Melt half the butter in a large, heavy saucepan. When the butter
turns the color of a hazelnut, add the lobsters and sprinkle with
salt and pepper. Cook over high heat for eight to 10 minutes, turning
lobsters often. They should turn evenly red all over. Remove the
lobsters from the saucepan. Arrange in a large roasting pan and place
in a preheated 250-F oven to keep them warm and to finish cooking.

Add the shallots to the saucepan and sizzle exactly 1 minute without
burning. Add the Calvados, ignite, and when the flame dies out, add
the cream. Work together the remaining butter and the flour. When the
sauce starts boiling, add the flour mixture (beurre manie), bit by
bit, whipping vigorously into the sauce with a wire whisk until
smooth. Bring slowly to a boil. Then mix in the tomalley and lemon
juice. Taste for seasoning and add salt and cayenne pepper, if
necessary. You may cook a bit longer to reduce the sauce if you like
it thicker. Stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce over the lobsters and
serve piping hot.

A rice pilaf is usually served with this dish, and we would recommend
a chilled white Traminer wine or a bottle of old cider.
