Powdered sugar for rolling
4    Egg whites
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Powdered sugar

Beat the egg whites until frothy, add salt and continue beating to
soft peaks.  Gradually sift in the sugar while continuing to beat
until stiff and shiny.  Reserve 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the mixture for
topping. Fold in 5 cups of almonds, the cinnamon and lemon juice to
the remainder, adding more almonds if the dough is sticky.  Chill for
5 minutes.

Sift powdered sugar onto the rolling surface.  Roll the dough out to
5/8 inch thickness.  Cut out cookies with a 2-inch star shapped
cookie cutter dipped into powdered sugar to prevent sticking.  Place
on parchment-lined cookie sheets.  Using fingers, spread the reserved
egg white mixture over the top of each star just to the edge of the
cookie. Let rest on the cookie sheets for 2 hours at room temperature.

Bake in a 200 F oven for 30 to 35 minutes.  The top should remain
white and the insides will be a bit sticky.  If the tops begin to
brown, cover wth parchment paper.  Cool and store in airtight
containers.

Makes about 4 dozen cookies.
