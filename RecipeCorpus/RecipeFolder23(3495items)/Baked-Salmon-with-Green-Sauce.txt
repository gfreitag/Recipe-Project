Title: Baked Salmon with Green Sauce
Categories: Fish, Salsa/sauce, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 t  Pepper
2 1/2 lb Salmon fillet,
1/2 t  Salt
-Green Sauce
3 loose cup herbs, washed ( a mixture of chives, dill, parsley,
watercress basil, and tarragon) 1/2 teas. salt 1/4 teas. Tabasco
sauce 1 egg yolk 2 tbs Dijon style mustard 3/4 cup oil (half canola,
half olive)

Place the fillet in a large ovenproof saucepan with a lid and add the
wine, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil on top of the stove, cover
immediately with the lid and place in preheated 400 degree oven for
10 min. At this point the salmon will still be slightly under cooked
in the center. Remove the salmon from the oven and set aside, covered
for 10 mon. The salmon will continue cooking in its own residual
heat. Pour off and reserve the juice from around the salmon.  There
should be approx. 1/2 cup. In the food processor, place the herbs and
the reserved salmon juice and process until the herbs  are chopped
fine.  Add the salt, tabasco sauce, egg yolk, and mustard and process
until combined. OPTIONAL: To kill any possible salmonella bacteria in
the egg yolk, pour the contents of the processor bowl into a 2 cup
measuring cup. Place the cup in a saucepan, fill the pan with enough
water so that it extends 2/3 of the way up the outside of the cup.
Bring the water to a boil and cook the mixture, stirring gently,
until it reaches a temp. of 160 degrees. Set the pan off the heat and
allow the cup to remain in the hot water bath for at least a minute.
(It will reach a temp. of 165 or 170 degrees.) Return the contents of
the cup to the food processor and add the oils in a steady stream,
while the machine is operating. The sauce should be a smooth and
beautiful green color. Pour the sauce onto a large platter, place the
salmon fillet on top, cutting it if necc. to make it fit properly,
and serve while lukewarm or at room temp.
