1 c  Olive oil, x-tra virgin
6 ea Eggs
4 tb Bread crumbs
2 lb Potatoes, small, round

Clean potatoes; boil until just tender; cool.  Peel them and place
on platter.  Cut 6 very thin slices from the cheese and grate the
rest.  Wash tomatoes and cut off tops; scoop out pulp and pass thru a
strainer; reserve.  Salt and pepper the tomato cases and turn upside
down to drain. Sprinkle the potatoes with the parsley and put them
into the tomatoes, then place the stuffed tomatoes in a shallow pan.
Drizzle some to the oil over the top, and sprinkle with part of the
grated cheese.  Pour the remaining oil and tomato pruee into the pan.
Bake in a preheated 350 F. oven for 15 min.  Remove from oven.

Spoon up some of the oil from the pan and baste the tomatoes with
it, then put a slice of cheese on each tomato, and break an egg--be
careful not to break the yolk--on top.  Sprinkle the eggs with salt,
pepper, the rest of the cheese, and the bread crumbs.  Return to the
oven to bake for another 15 min. at 300 F.  Serve immediately.
