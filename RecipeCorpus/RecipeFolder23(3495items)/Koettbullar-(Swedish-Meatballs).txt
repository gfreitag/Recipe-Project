Title: Koettbullar (Swedish Meatballs)
Categories: Appetizer, Ground beef, European, Pork, Veal
Yield: 8 servings
1/3 lb Ground pork
1 lg Egg
1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c  Unseasoned bread crumbs
1/2 c  Half and half cream
4 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Minced white onions
1/3 lb Ground beef
1/3 lb Ground veal
1.  Soak the bread crumbs in the half and half for 5 minutes in a
large mixing bowl.

2.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over low to
moderate heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the onions and
saute them for about 2 minutes. Let cool slightly.

3.  Add the beef, veal, pork, egg nutmeg, salt, pepper, and onions to
the bread-crumb mixture. Gently combine the ingredients with your
hands.

4.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for a couple of hours.

5.  Shape the meat mixture with your hands into uniform 2/3-inch
balls. Arrange them on a plate in one layer so they do not touch each
other. Let the meatballs stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

6.  Melt the remaining butter in a saute pan or skillet over moderate
heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the meatballs. (Do not
crowd the pan; unless your pan is oversized, you will have to cook
gthe meatballs in batches and keep the cooked ones warm in a
preheated 200 degree F oven.) Saute the meatballs for about 5 minutes
until they become brown on all sides. Turn them as necessary, but do
so gently.

7.  Transfer the 'koettbullar' to a warm platter and serve
immediately.

Serves 8.
