Categories: Potato, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
1/3 c  Stock
Salt and pepper to taste
1 T  Butter
1    Head of garlic
3 md Onions, halved and sliced
... into thin half moons
8 md New potatoes, cut in half
Preheat the oven to 400. Separate the head of garlic into cloves and
peel. Scatter the cloves and the onion slices on the bottom of a
baking dish that will hold the potatoes in a single layer. Place the
halved potateos, cut side down, on the bed of garlic and onions. Pour
in enough stock to come about one quarter of the way up the sides of
the dish. Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly over all, then dot with
butter. Bake, uncovered, for one hour, or until the potatoes are
tender, the onions beginning to brown and the liquid about gone.
Serve piping hot.
