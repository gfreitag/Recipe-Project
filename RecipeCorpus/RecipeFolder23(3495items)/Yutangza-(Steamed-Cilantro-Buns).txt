Title: Yutangza (Steamed Cilantro Buns)
Categories: Bread, Ussr, Herbs/spice
Yield: 16 servings
1/2 ts Salt
8 tb Butter, sweet
3 c  Flour, unbleached
1 c  Cilantro, fresh; finely chop
1 pk Yeast, dry
2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  ;Water, lukewarm
1/2 c  Milk
Approx. Cook Time:  2:30 In a
large bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let proof. Stir
in the milk, salt, and two tablespoons of the butter and mix well
with a wooden spoon. Stir in three cups of the flour, one cup at a
time, stirring well after each addition.  Transfer the dough to a
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about eight
minutes, adding enough of the remaining flour to prevent sticking.
Shape the dough into a ball. Place in a buttered bowl and turn to
coat. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place
until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and
knead briefly. Divide into sixteen parts and shape each into a ball.
On a floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll out one ball to
a round about 1/16" thick.  Brush generously with melted butter and
sprinkle all over with cilantro.  Fold in the edges of the round so
they meet in the center and roll into a smooth bun between the palms
of your hands.  Repeat with the remaining balls of dough.
Place the buns on a buttered baking sheet, brush lightly with melted
butter, and let them rise, covered, for about 20 minutes. In a bamboo
or metal steamer set over simmering water, steam as many buns as will
fit without touching, partially covered, until cooked through, about
20 minutes.  Steam the rest of the buns.  Serve slightly warm.
