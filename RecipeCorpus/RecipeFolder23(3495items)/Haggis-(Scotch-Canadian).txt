Title: Haggis (Scotch-Canadian)
Categories: European, Pork
Yield: 8 servings
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
2 1/2 lb Pork fat or salt pork
1 lb Pork liver; approx 3 lb
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
This New Brunswick recipe reflects a change in the traditional haggis
~ a change which recent Scottish arrivals consider akin to sacrilege.

Directions:  Grease a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.  Cut Pork fat in cubes and
fry out the fat from the pork or salt pork fat. Pour off the grease
as it accumulates.  When the pieces are golden brown and crisp they
are called "crackin's in Ontario, or "Kips" in the Maritimes.  Drain
well. Cool.

Wash the pork liver and place in a large pot.  Cover with boiling
water and boil for about 1 hour, or until a fork can easily be
inserted. Remove liver and allow to cool. Reserve liquid. Put cooled
liver and 2 cups of cracklin's through the food grinder. Mix
together. Stir in the oats, salt and pepper.  Add sufficient cooking
liquid to hold mixture together. Press into prepared loaf pan, cover
with waxed paper and foil. Steam for 1 hour. Cool.

To Serve, slice 1/2 inch thick and pan fry until golden brown on both
sides. Serve piping hot.
