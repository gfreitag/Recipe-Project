Categories: Asian, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Tamarind
2 tb Soy Sauce, Dark
2 tb Oil
Salt To Taste
Pepper, Black To Taste
1 1/2 lb Fish Fillet
2    Shallots
Ginger, 1" Piece
2    Thai Chiles
1/2 ts Turmeric
Remove all skin from fish fillets, ensure that no bones remain and
cut into serving-size pieces.  Chop very finely the shallots, ginger,
garlic and chiles, and pound these together with the turmeric powder,
tamarind and soy sauce (or use a food processor).  Heat the oil in a
shallow pan and stir-fry the spice-paste for four to five minutes,
then add the fish, cover with approximately one cup of cold water and
bring to a boil. Lower heat, season to taste with salt and freshly
ground black pepper and cook over a very low heat until the fish is
done. Serve with fresh vegetables and rice.
