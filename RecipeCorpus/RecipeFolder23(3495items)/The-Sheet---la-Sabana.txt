Jim Vorheis
6 oz Slice filet mignon, about 1
-1/2 to 3 inches wide
1/8 ts Fresh lime juice,
Place the beef between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound, pushing
it outward as you go, to a rough oval shape.  Fold into a package and
pound out again to the required size.  Peel off the top plastic wrap
and replace with wax paper.  Turn meat over and replace second sheet
of plastic with wax paper; set aside until ready to use.

Heat a griddle.  When very hot, grease lightly.  Remove top paper.
Sprinkle the exposed side of the meat with lime juice and salt and
pepper and lay it face down, with the aid of the paper, on the
griddle. Strip off the bottom paper.  Cook for about 2 seconds, flip
the meat over with two spatulas so it will not break in the middle,
and cook for 2 seconds more. Serve immediately, flat if possible, on
a large plate with refried beans, and fresh salsa of your choice.
