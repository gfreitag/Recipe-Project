Simple, but a true conversation piece. The first time I ate them,
they were covered with red rose petals.

Peel the apples and grate into a clear glass bowl.  Stir in the lemon
juice to prevent discoloration.  Add sugar, rose water, and mix
gently. Cover and refrigerate 3-4 hours.  To serve, top with finely
crushed ice and garnish with lemon.  Serve immediately.  Serves 6.
