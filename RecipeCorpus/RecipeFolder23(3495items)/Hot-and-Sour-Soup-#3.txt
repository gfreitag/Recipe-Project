Mix marinade until it is smooth, add pork, and marinate 30 minutes.
Rinse soaked tree ears thoroughly to remove any sand, then shred.
Rinse mushrooms, discard tough stems, and shred. Remove hard stem end
of tiger lilies and pull each blossom apart into two or three shreds.

Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan.  Add pork and vegetables
and bring to a boil again.  Cover and simmer 10 minutes  Add
seasonings and stir.  Stir dissolved cornstarch, which will have
settled, and add. Stir soup until thickened, about 1 minute.  With a
chopstick or wooden spoon gently stir the soup as you slowly pour in
the egg.  The egg will form delicate shreds in the soup.  Remove from
heat and stir in sesame oil, if desired.  Garnish with scallion, and
serve immediately in individual bowls
