Asparagus salad is typical of many Chinese vegetable salads, in that
the vegetable is first steamed, then cooled, before slicing and
dressing.

Wash asparagus spears.  Use sharp paring knife to peel off tough
white skin on lower stem and cut off the very end.  When steamer is
hot, steam spears until barely cooked.  They are overcooked when the
color is olive. Remove from steamer, drain any water, and cool to
room temperature. Meanwhile, mix dressing ingredients in small bowl.
Slice pickled red ginger into thin slivers.  About ten minutes before
serving, slice spears on the bias into 2" segments.  Place on serving
dish, intermingled with pickled ginger. Pour dressing over asparagus,
and let it permeate the salad. Serve at room temperature.  This salad
can also be served while asparagus is still warm, or it can be
chilled.
