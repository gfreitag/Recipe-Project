1.  Trim the stems from the cauliflower florets and cut them into 1/2
inch pieces, then break the florets into 1/2-inch pieces.  Fill a
large bowl with 2 quarts of cold water and stir in the vinegar.  Add
the cauliflower pieces and stir to clean thoroughly.  Bring a large
saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Drop the
cauliflower into the boiling water, return to a boil and cook over
moderately high heat until just tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain the
cauliflower thoroughly.

2.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic and hot red pepper in the
olive oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
garlic is golden, about 3 minutes.  Add the cauliflower and cook for
5 minutes, stirring to prevent it from browning.  Stir in the hot
Vegetable Broth, salt and parsley.

3.  Using a slotted spoon, remove 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower
from the soup and puree it in a blender or food processor until
smooth. Return it to the soup, increase the heat to moderate and heat
through. Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle on a generous amount
of cheese.

NOTE:  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as you like and serve
with lots of crusty Italian bread.

Serves 6.
