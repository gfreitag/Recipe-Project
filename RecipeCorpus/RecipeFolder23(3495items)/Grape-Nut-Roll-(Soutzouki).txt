Candied nuts and grape juice, "soutzouki", is an ancient candy recipe
still being used in the villages of Greece.  The traditional recipe
is quite involved, calling for the stringing of walnuts like beads on
linen thread, boiling many pounds of grapes into a thick syrup and
coating the nuts by pouring the thick syrup over them just as if you
were making candies until a purple necklace is formed.  You can make
this recipe in a simpler way without having to stamp on the grapes
with bare feet.

In a large deep pot bring juice and honey or sugar to a vigorous
boil. Add pectin and boil 5 minutes.  Dissolve citric acid first in a
tablespoon of hot syrup, then add to the rest of the syrup, mixing it
in.  Add nuts. Dissolve cornstarch in cold water and mix into syrup,
stirring quickly. Cook 1 minutes more.
Ladle thick mixture on to heavy waxed paper.  Make a long thick
roll. Pick up two sides of paper and press together to make a fat
sausage of candy.  Let set at room temperature.  Store in plastic
bag.  Slice as needed.
