Karen Mintzias
1 lb Raw medium shrimp
Salt
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 ts Chinese chili sauce
2    Garlic cloves
- finely minced
2 tb Chopped fresh basil
2 tb Fish sauce
2 tb Lime juice
2 tb Water
2 ts Sugar
ADVANCE PREPARATION: Shell the shrimp, then devein by cutting along
the top of the curve, starting at the tail and making a progressively
deeper cut so the knife nearly cuts through the shrimp at the thick
end.  Rinse out the vein.  Bring a large amount of lightly salted
water to a rapid boil and add the shrimp.  Cook until shrimp are
done, between 1 and 2 minutes. To test, cut a shrimp in half; it
should be white in the center. Transfer the shrimp immediately to a
bowl of ice water to cool.  When chilled, drain and refrigerate until
ready to use.

Mince and place in separate containers the red pepper and chives.
Finely chop the peanuts in a food processor and set aside.  Combine
the sauce ingredients and mix well.

LAST-MINUTE PREPARATION:  Toss the shrimp with the sauce.  Put in a
decorative bowl and place the bowl in crushed ice.  Sprinkle the
shrimp with the red pepper, chives and peanuts.  Serve at once.

Serves: 4 to 8 as an appetizer or 4 as a first course.
