Title: Coconut Milk
Categories: Asian, Indian
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  To 2 1/2 cups boiling water
1 lg Coconut, grated
Coconut Milk is Santen in Malaysia and Indonesia.  Coconut Milk is
Narial Ka Doodth in India. Best made from Fresh Coconuts. Grate the
flesh of one Coconut into a bowl, pour on 2-2 1/2 c  Boiling Water,
then leave to stand 30 min. Squeeze

The flesh and strain before using. This makes thick Coconut Milk, for
a thinner milk reuse the pulp and mix the result with the thick milk,
or use by itself for an even thinner Coconut Milk. I use an old
T-shirt to squeeze the Coconut flesh and strain in one operation.

Made from Dried Coconut Put 1 Cup unsweetened Dried Coconut into a
blender. Pour in about 1 1/4 Cups boiling water and blend on high
speed for a couple of minutes. Let cool for about fifteen minutes
then squeeze the pulp and strain. Makes about 1 Cup milk. To make a
thinner milk reuse the pulp.
