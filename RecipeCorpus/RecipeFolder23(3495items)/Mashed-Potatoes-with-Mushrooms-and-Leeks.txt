Categories: Potato, Vegetable, Mushroom
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Butter, softened and cut in
... pieces
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Sour cream, at room temp
3 lg Baking potatoes
1 1/2 T  Butter
1    Leek, thinly sliced
1 lb Mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 ts Vegetable oil
Boil the potatoes until tender. Heat 1/2 T butter in a skillet and
cook the leeks for 5 - 7 minutes, until tender and golden. Set aside.
In a large skillet, over moderate heat, cook the mushrooms in the
remaining tablespoon of butter until they begin to render their
juices. Turn up the heat and continue cooking until they are almost
dry. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350. When the
potatoes are tender, drain, peel, and return them to the pot. Toss
over low heat to dry, then put them through a ricer into a mixer
bowl. Beat in the softened butter, buttermilk, and salt and pepper to
taste. Spread half the potatoes on the bottom of a shallow baking
dish.  Spread the mushrooms over the potatoes and the leeks over the
mushrooms.  Spread with 1 cup of sour cream and cover with the
remaining potatoes. Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour or
until browned and bubbling.
