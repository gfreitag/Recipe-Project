Using 1 quart of freshly made popcorn as a serving size; select one
of the listed flavor combinations and follow directions.  In most
cases adding the flavor to the melted butter or margarine would be
the easiest method. The strawberry flavored drink mix will give
strawberry flavored popcorn. The instant Cappuccino mix will give
Cappuccino flavor.  The dry Blue Cheese and garlic salt will give
Blue Cheese flavor.  The combination of curry powder, cumin and
garlic salt is good for curry.  Chili seasoning will give a south of
the border flavor and finally adding Tabasco sauce to your taste to
the melted butter will give that added kick some may prefer.
