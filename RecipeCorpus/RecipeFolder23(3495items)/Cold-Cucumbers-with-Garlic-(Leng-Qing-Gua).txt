SLICE THE CUCUMBERS in half lengthways. Using a spoon, remove the
seeds. Cut the cucumber halves into 3-by-1/2-inch pieces. Combine the
cucumber pieces with salt and allow to sit in a colander set inside a
bowl for 10 minutes. Rinse them in cold water, blot them dry and toss

is lightly brown. Mix with the cucumbers and serve.
