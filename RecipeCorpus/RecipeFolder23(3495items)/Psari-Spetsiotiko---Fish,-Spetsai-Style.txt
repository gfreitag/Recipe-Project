Karen Mintzias
2 lb Fish
-(snapper, porgy, mullet,
-OR any favorite), cleaned
-and left whole or sliced
-into steaks
1    Lemon; juiced
Salt
1/3 c  Olive oil
4    Ripe tomatoes
-(fresh or canned)
Wash and dry the fish (if using dried cod be sure it was soaked
overnight), then sprinkle with salt and lemon juice, particulary
inside the neck area if using fish with heads on.  Arrange on a
baking-serving dish and set aside while you prepare the sauce.

Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the tomatoes, wine, garlic, and sugar
and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  (The amount of garlic may be
reduced, but it *IS* the most important ingredient.)  Season with
salt and pepper.

Sprinkle the fish with a light coating of bread crumbs and then with
the chopped parsley, then spoon the hot sauce over the fish.  Repeat
the procedure until all the sauce has been used, ending with a
topping of bread crumbs.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to
40 minutes, depending on the size of the fish, basting twice with the
sauce.  (A golden crust will form on the fish, characteristic of this
famous style.) During the baking period, add some wie or tomato juice
if necessary; some sauce should remain around the fish.  Serve hot.

NOTE: This makes an excellent first course with dry white Demesticha
or Samos wine.
