The preparation of Thai curry pastes involves pounding or grinding
together an array of spices and herbs. This recipe is very hot; cut
down on the amount of dried red chilies if a milder curry is desired.

In a mortar or a small bowl, combine all the ingredients. Using a
pestle or the back of a metal spoon, press down on the mixture and
stir until it forms a paste. (The curry paste can be prepared ahead
and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1
week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.)

Makes 3 to 3 1/2 Tbsp.
