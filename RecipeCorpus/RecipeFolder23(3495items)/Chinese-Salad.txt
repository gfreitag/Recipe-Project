1/2    Green onions; bunch, chopped
1    Chinese Cabbage; Napa (head)

2 tb Sunflower seeds

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Red Wine Vinegar
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Oil
Chop cabbage in medium pieces, add chopped green onions.

Brown noodles, sunflower seeds, almonds in margarine (set aside to
cool).

Boil sugar, oil, vinegar, and soy sauce, cool completely

Toss everything together just before serving.  This salad will not
keep overnight-primarily because it will be all eaten, and because
the noodles will become soggy and the variety of texture will be
destroyed.

If you want salad over several days, keep Greens, Noodle/Nut Mixture,
Dressing separate and put together just before eating.
