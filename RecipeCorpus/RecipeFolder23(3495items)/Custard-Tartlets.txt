Categories: Chinese, Dessert
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
2 tb Whipping cream
1/2 ts Salt
3 c  Dried beans, for weighting
- down pastry shell
1 c  Flour
4 tb Butter, cut into small
- pieces
2 tb Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Water
4 tb Sugar
MIX ALL THE PASTRY INGREDIENTS together in a bowl or food processor
until well mixed. Roll the pastry into a ball, wrap it with plastic
wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to
375F. Roll out the pastry to about 1/8-inch thick and press into 6
small 3-inch tartlet molds. Place a sheet of foil over the sides and
surface of the pastry and pour enough dried beans on the foil to
weight it down. Bake for about 10-to-12 minutes or until the dough is
lightly browned. In a saucepan, boil together the water and sugar for
5 minutes to make a light syrup. Let the syrup cool thoroughly and
combine it with the eggs. Pour an equal amount of custard into each
pastry shell. Reduce the oven heat to 325F and bake for 15 minutes or
until the custard just sets.
