Title: Bombay Monkfish
Categories: Indian, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Lemon juice
1/4 ts Fresh rosemary, chopped or
-pinch of dried
1 pn Of saffron or tumeric
3/4 c  Light or single cream
Salt and pepper to taste
1 lb Monkfish, skinned
Milk to cover
1/4 lb Shrimp, shelled
2    Eggs
3 tb Tomato paste
1/2 ts Curry powder
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Put the monkfish in a pan just large
enough to hold it.  Pour the milk over and place the pan over
moderate heat. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 8 minutes. Turn
the fish and cook 7 minutes longer, or until the fish is cooked
through. When the monkfish is nearly done, add the shrimp and cook
2-3 minutes, or until they turn pink. Drain fish and shrimp,
discarding milk. Cut the monkfish into bite-size pieces.

Beat the eggs with the tomato paste, curry powder, lemon juice,
rosemary, saffron and 1/2 cup cream.  Mix in the fish and shrimp and
season to taste with salt and pepper.  Turn into 4 individual ramekin
dishes and pour an equal amount of the remaining cream over the top
of each dish. Bake for 20 minutes, or until set. Serve hot with a
ssqueeze of lemon and a crusty french type bread.

This is an appetizing and stylish way to start a meal.  For a light
lunch dish for two, cook this in one ovenproof dish and serve it with
a green salad and boiled new potatoes.
