Htipiti (pronounced h-tee-pee-TEE and translated as "that which is
beaten") is the name Macedonians gave to this tart feta spread.  The
longer it is beaten, the more tart it will be.

In medium-size bowl, mash feta with fork or potato masher and slowly
add olive oil, chopped peppers, oregano, and black pepper.  Pulverize
mixture for about 10 minutes (less if using a food processor),
pouring in lemon juice a little at a time, until feta is creamy.
Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.  Yields about 1
cup.
