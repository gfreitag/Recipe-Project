Title: Japanese Cashew Tamari Dressing
Categories: Japanese, Condiment
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Cashews
6 oz Salad Oil
2 oz Tamari
Pour the oil and tamari into a blender and blend until well mixed.
Add the cashews and pulse briefly, to chop them coarsely. Serve. If
this is too salty, back off on the tamari. This can be adjusted
infinitely to individual taste. Tamari is one kind of Japanese Soy
Sauce. It comes in reasonable sized bottles, but is somewhat more
expensive than other Soy Sauces due to the method it is manufactured.
