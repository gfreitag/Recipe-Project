Karen Mintzias
8    Navel oranges
1/2 c  Sugar
Remove the zest of 2 of the oranges with a zester; or pare finely
with a vegetable peeler, then cut into thin julienne strips.  With a
very sharp knife, cut off the skin and outside membrane of all the
oranges, so you have glistening orbs of golden pulp.  Do this over a
bowl to catch escaping juice.

Choose a saucepan just large enough to hold 2 oranges at a time and
put in the escaped juice and remaining ingredients.  Dissolve the
sugar and simmer for 5 minutes.  Submerge 2 oranges at a time and
cook just long enough to warm them through - about 3 minutes.  If
they bob up, place a small weighted saucer over them.  Remove to a
serving dish and continue with the next pair until finished.

Boil to reduce the syrup by half, drizzle over the oranges, and chill.
