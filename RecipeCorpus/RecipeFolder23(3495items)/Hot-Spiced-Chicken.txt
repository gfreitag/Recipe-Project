Title: Hot Spiced Chicken
Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Finely chopped ginger root
1 ts Chili bean sauce, or:
1/2 ts Chili powder
1 1/3 c  Chicken stock
1/2 ts Ground Sichuan peppercorns
- roasted, (optional)
1/2 ts Granulated sugar
2 ts Dark soy sauce
1 lb Chicken pieces, (wings or
- thighs)
1/2 ts Salt
2    Scallions
2/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
1    Dried red chile, halved
- lengthwise
1 ts Oil
RUB THE CHICKEN PIECES with the salt and let them sit for about 30
minutes. Cut the scallions into 2-inch pieces. Heat the 2/3 cup of
oil in a wok or large skillet, and then add the dried chile to flavor
the oil. When it turns black, turn the heat down. (At this point you
may remove the chile or leave it in as the Chinese do.) Slowly brown
the chicken pieces, a few at a time, skin-side down. Turn the chicken
pieces over and brown the other side. Drain the cooked pieces on
paper towels. Heat a clean wok or skillet and add 1 teaspoon oil. Fry
in it the scallions, ginger and chili bean sauce (or chile powder),
taking care not to have the heat too high or the sauce will burn. A
few seconds later, add the chicken stock, Sichuan peppercorns, sugar
and dark soy sauce. Then turn the heat down low, and add the chicken
pieces. Cover, and finish cooking the chicken in this sauce, turning
the pieces from time to time. This should take about 20-to-30
minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce, first removing any surface
fat.
