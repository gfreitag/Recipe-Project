Stephen Ceideburg
2 lb Lamb, beef or goat, cut into
-1 1/2-inch cubes
3 tb Distilled white vinegar
1 1/4 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 tb Olive oil
3    Whole dried hot red chiles
5    Garlic cloves, peeled and
Put the cubed meat into a bowl and add the vinegar, salt and pepper.
Set aside for 30 to 40 minutes. Drain the meat, saving the liquid,
and pat it dry.

In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. When it is
hot, add the chiles. Stir for a few seconds or until they swell and
darken. Remove chiles with a slotted spoon and set aside. Put as many
cubes of meat into the pan as will fit without crowding.

Brown the meat on all sides and repeat until all of the meat is
browned. Remove meat from pan.

Put the onion and garlic into the pan and cook for 2 minutes,
scraping up any pan juices. Put in the black peppercorns, cinnamon
and bay leaves. Stir and cook another minute. Return the meat to the
pan with its accumulated juices, the chiles, the reserved marinade
and the tomato paste. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Add 2 cups water
and bring to a boil. Cover, turn the heat to low and cook for 15
minutes.

Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into 1 1/2-inch cubes. When
the meat has cooked for 15 minutes, add the potatoes. Cover and
continue to cook for 45-60 minutes or until the meat is tender. Seed
the bell pepper and cut it into 1/4-inch wide strips. When the meat
is tender, put the peppers and olives into the stew. Stir and cook
another 3-5 minutes.
