Yield: 6 servings
Ground White Peppers

6 c  Chicken or Pork Stock
3 md Zucchini
1 1/2 c  Lean Ground Pork or Chicken

Peel zucchini and cut into approximately 1-1/2" lengths.  Make the
lengths of zucchini into cups by scooping out the seeds in the
center, but leaving small amount to form the bottom of the cup.  You
may need more or less zucchini than the amount given, depending on
the size.

In a bowl, mix the ground pork or chicken with fish sauce, eggs,
ground white peppers, and cilantro.  Fill the zucchini cups with the
mixture, and overfill slightly to make a small mound.  Cook the
filled zucchini cups by steaming for about 1/2 hour.

Bring the chicken or pork stock to a boil, and season to taste.
Place the precooked zucchini cups into a serving tureen, pour the
boiling stock over them, and serve.
