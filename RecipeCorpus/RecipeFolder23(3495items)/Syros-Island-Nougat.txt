Title: Syros Island Nougat
Categories: Candy, Greek
Yield: 1 servings
3    Egg whites
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Oil for pan
Cornstarch (or see note)
Karen Mintzias
1 c  Roasted pistachios & almonds
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Corn syrup
1 c  Honey
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
Note: Sweet rice flour or thin rice wafers may be used instead of
cornstarch to line pan.

Roast nuts on shallow pan in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for
10 minutes.
Combine sugar, corn syrup, water, and cream of tartar in a deep
sauce pot.  Stir gently over medium heat until sugar dissolves and
bring to a boil.  After it comes to a boil, cover pot for 5 minutes,
then wash down sides of pot with a clean brush to remove sugar
crystals.  Continue cooking on medium-high heat to 272 degrees F on a
jelly thermometer. Remove from heat.
In a separate pot heat honey to boil.
Whip egg whites and salt until stiff and dry using a heavy
electric mixer and large bowl.  Add a small amount of honey at first
in a thin stream, very slowly.  Beat in vanilla and continue adding
remaining honey and then syrup.  Beat until batch thickens and the
beater slows down.  Add nuts and blend in.
Oil a long shallow pan.  Sift a thick layer of cornstarch or
sweet rice flour over it or lay rice wafers over bottom.  Pour out
the nougat. Dust top with more rice flour or thin rice wafers and let
stand overnight to set.  Cut into rectangular pieces about 3/4" by 1"
and wrap individually in heavy waxed paper.
