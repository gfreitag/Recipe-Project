Title: Red Hot Grilled Potatoes
Categories: Potato
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 ts Chili powder
3/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Salt
12 sm New white potatoes,
- about 2 1/4 lb total
3 tb Light-tasting olive oil
1 1/2 tb Hungarian paprika
1.  Put rack in center of oven; heat oven to 400 degrees. Have ready
foil-lined baking pan, large enough to hold potatoes in a single
layer.

2.  Put potatoes in plastic food bag.  In small dish, combine
remaining ingredients.  Add mixture to potatoes. Shake bag to coat
potatoes. Transfer potatoes in a single layer to prepared baking
sheet. Drizzle any remaining oil and spices over potatoes.

3.  Bake until just barely tender (but still firm), 25 to 30 minutes,
depending on size of potatoes.  Turn a few times during baking. Can be
baked several hours ahead and kept at room temperature.

4.  To serve, sprinkle with salt and place over hot barbecue fire
until seared and hot, just a few minutes, turning often. Serve hot.

These potatoes are "red hot" from the paprika, chili powder and
cayenne pepper.  Omit the pepper if you prefer a milder taste. These
potatoes can be roasted several hours ahead and kept at room
temperature before grilling at dinner time.
