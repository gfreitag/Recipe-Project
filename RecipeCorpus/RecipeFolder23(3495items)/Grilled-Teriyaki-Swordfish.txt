Title: Grilled Teriyaki Swordfish
Categories: Japanese, Seafood
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Brown sugar
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1    Clove garlic minced or
-pressed
2 ts Lemon juice
4    Fresh swordfish steaks
1/2 c  Light soy sauce
1/4 c  Pineapple juice (no sugar
-added)
1/4 c  Sherry
In a non-reactive bowl, combine the soy sauce, pineapple juice,
sherry, brown sugar, ginger and lemon juice. Place in heavy plastic
bag with swordfish steaks and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, turning
bag occasionally to thoroughly marinate all surfaces of the fish.
Remove swordfish from bag and grill over high heat, 4-5 minutes on
each side, turning once. Be careful not to overcook swordfish; it
dries out quickly (fish is done when flesh is opaque and flakes
easily with fork). Serve with lightly grilled slices of pineapple and
baked sweet potatoes.
