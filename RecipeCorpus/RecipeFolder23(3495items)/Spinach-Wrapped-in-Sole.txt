Title: Spinach Wrapped in Sole
Categories: Fish, Seafood, Vegetable, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1    Salt
1    Black Pepper, freshly ground
1 1/2 c  Dry White Wine
1/3 c  Whipping Cream
10 oz Spinach, fresh
2 T  Butter
1/2 c  Onions, finely chopped
1    Nutmeg
6    Sole Fillets
Wash spinach thoroughly and chop finely. Heat butter in heavy frying
pan and saute onions until limp but not browned. Add chopped spinach
and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with nutmeg. Pat
fish fillets dry, season with pepper and salt and top each fillet
with an equal amount of spinach mixture. Roll up fillets and fasten
with toothpicks. Butter a baking dish just large enough to allow
rolled fillets in a single layer. Add wine and bake in oven preheated
to 400 degrees for 10 - 15 minutes. Remove fillets and keep warm.
Transfer pan liquid to a saucepan, bring to a boil and simmer for 10
minutes to reduce. Blend in cream and heat, but do not permit to
boil. Serve at once, spooning sauce over fish and removing
toothpicks. Serves 6.
