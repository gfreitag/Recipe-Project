Title: Pita Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 14 servings
2 pk Dry yeast
2 c  Water
1/4 c  Oil or shortening
Cornmeal
Karen Mintzias
5 c  Bread flour (or more)
3 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast in large bowl of electric
mixer and blend well. Heat water and oil in small saucepan until very
warm (120 to 130F). Add warm liquid to flour mixture. Blend at low
speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand stir
in 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour until dough pulls cleanly away from sides of
bowl. On floured surface knead in 1/2 to 1 cup flour until dough is
smooth and elastic with blisters under surface, about 10 minutes.
Place dough in greased bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap and
cloth towel. Let rise in warm place until light and doubled in bulk,
about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough, divide in 2 parts, then mold
into balls. Allow to rest on counter, covered with inverted bowl, 15
minutes. Divide dough in 14 equal pieces and shape into balls. On
lightly floured surface, roll each ball into 7-inch circle about
1/8-inch thick. Place circles about 2 inches apart on
cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheets. Cover and let rise in warm place
about 30 minutes. Bake at 450F 8 to 10 minutes, or until edges turn
light golden brown.
