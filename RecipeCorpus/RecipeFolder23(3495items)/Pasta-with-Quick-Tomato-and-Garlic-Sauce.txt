Categories: Italian, Pasta, Salsa/sauce

PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta; roll the dough as thin as possible
and cut into 1/8- to 1/4-inch wide strips.  Peel, seed, and chop the
tomatoes. Mince the garlic.  Heat the olive oil over low heat in a
saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over medium heat for about 3
minutes, until soft. Add the tomatoes, raise the heat to high, and
cook for 5 minutes, until they give up some of their juice.  NOTE:
Recipe can be made up to this point several hours ahead.

COOKING AND SERVING:  Chop the parsley and basil.  Cook the pasta in a
large pot of boiling, salted water until tender, about 3 minutes for
fresh pasta.  Drain and return pasta to pot.  Add tomato sauce and
fresh herbs. Toss over low heat until pasta is lightly coated with
sauce and warmed through.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese if desired.
