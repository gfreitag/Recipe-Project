Categories: Kids, Snack
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Water
Coarse salt
2    (16 oz) loaves frozen whole
-wheat bread dough, thawed
1    Egg white, slightly beaten
Thaw bread in the refrigerator overnight. From each loaf, shape 12
1-1/2 inch balls. Roll each ball into a rope approximately 14 inches
long. Shape into pretzels by forming a knot and looping ends through.
Arrange pretzels one inch apart on well-greased baking sheet. Let
stand for 20 minutes. Brush combined egg white and water on pretzels,
then sprinkle with coarse salt. Place in a shallow pan containing one
inch of boiling water on a lower rack in the oven. Bake pretzels on a
cookie sheet on a rack above the water at 350 for 20 minutes or till
golden brown. Makes two dozen pretzels.

Variation 1: Pretzel Sticks can be made by beginning with balls
rolled into 8-inch sticks. Try pretzel letters, which is something
small children will enjoy helping you do.

Variation 2: Roll sticks 4-6 inches long in mixture of melted butter,
cinnamon and sugar before baking.
