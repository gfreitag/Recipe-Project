2 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 lb Lean veal; in 1-1/2" cubes
2    Garlic cloves
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
2 tb Dry red wine
3    Peeled tomatoes; chopped
In a baking-serving casserole, heat the oil, then add the veal and
saute on all sides.  Add the garlic and season with salt and pepper.
Stir with a wooden spoon, then add the vinegar, wine, tomatoes, bay
leaf, sugar, and enough water to cover the veal.  Arrange the onions
over the meat, sprinkle the parsley and butter bits over the top, and
slip the spices in between the meat and the onions.  Shake the
casserole a few times, then cover with an inverted plate to keep in
place and cover tightly with a lid (using a little flour-water paste
around the inside of the lid to seal if you wish). Bake in a slow
oven (300 F) for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or over minimum heat on a burner,
until the veal and onions are tender.  Remove from the heat and serve
warm.

Note: After peeling the onions, pierce the root end of each onion
with the tip of a small, sharp knife, then slash again at a right
angle to make a cross.  This will keep the onion whole and intact
during the cooking process.
