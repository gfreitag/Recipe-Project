Title: Jose Giles's Pozole
Categories: Tex/mexican, Pork
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Coarse salt
4 qt Water
4    14 oz cans whole hominy
4 lb To 5 lb fresh ham or pork
- loin
1    Or 2 cloves garlic, crushed
(6-8 Servings)

In a kettle, add the pork, garlic, salt and water.  Bring to the boil
and simmer until meat is tender.

Remove pork and shred.  Cool the broth and skim accumulated fat.

Put the pork in a large, flat baking dish and add approximately a soup
ladle of broth to keep the pork moist. Cover with aluminum foil.

Bring remaining broth to boil again and add the hominy, discarding
half the liquid in the cans.  (This step may be reserved until just
before serving.) Simmer 20 minutes.

Warm pork in oven before serving.

Extra Ingredients

4    large limes, cut into eighths 4 medium-size avocados, diced in
1-inch chunks 1 large spanish onion, diced 2 packages Fritos 2
packages fried bacon rind 1/4 c. crushed red chile 1/4 c. oregano

To keep diced avocado, save the pit and place in serving dish with the
diced avocado.  This will prevent it from turning brown.

Place all other ingredients in appropriate serving dishes.  If onion
and lime are prepared in advance, cover with foil or plastic wrap.

Serving

In a large soup bowl, serve a small portion of shredded pork and
hominy with enough broth to fill approximately half the bowl.

Instruct guests that they are to add ingredients gingerly until each
finds the taste combination that suits his/her palate.

Fried bacon rinds and fritos may be crushed or added whole. Lime is
squeezed for juice.

Free-for-all.  Everyone is invited to help him/herself to experiment
with combinations.

Author's Note:  All the quantities are approximations based on
experience. If guests are delicate eaters, you'll have leftover
pozole, which is delicious.  If they are heavy eaters, add more meat
and ingredients.
