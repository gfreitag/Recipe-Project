Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 servings
3 T  Lemon juice
3 t  Onion powder
-salt & pepper
2 lb White perch fillets
1 t  Garlic powder
2 t  Worcester sauce
-Margarine
Mix lemon juice, garlic powder, onion powder and Worcester sauce in a
bowl. Spread fish fillets on aluminum foil and salt and pepper. Pour
mixture over fillets. Spread several pats of margarine on top the
fillets and seal aluminum foil. Place on hot grill about 4 inches
above coals and cook for 20 minutes or until fillets are flaky to the
touch of a fork. This recipe would also work in a oven by replacing
the aluminum foil with a baking dish. Flounder, striped bass, black
bass, white bass or most any white meat fillets could be substituted
for the white perch.
