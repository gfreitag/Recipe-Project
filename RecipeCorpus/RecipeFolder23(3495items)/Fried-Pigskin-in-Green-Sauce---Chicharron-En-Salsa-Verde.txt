Jim Vorheis
1 1/2 lb Tomatillos
4    To 5 chilies serranos (to
-taste)
1    Garlic clove, peeled and
-roughly chopped
1/4 c  Loosely packed, roughly
Remove the husks from the tomate verde and rinse will.  Put into a
saucepan with the fresh chilies, cover with water, and bring to a
simmer. Continue simmering until soft but not falling apart, about 10
minutes. Drain the tomate verde and transfer with the chilies and 1/4
cup of the cooking water to a blender.  Add the garlic and cilantro
and blend until smooth.

Heat the lard in a frying pan, add the onion, and fry gently, without
browning, for 1 minute.  Add the blended sauce and fry over high heat,
stirring from time to time, until reduced and thickened - about 7
minutes. Add salt to taste and the pieces of chicharron and continue
cooking over medium heat until the chicharron is just soft - about 5
minutes, depending on thickness and quality.

Serve with corn tortillas and a dollop of frijoles refritos.
