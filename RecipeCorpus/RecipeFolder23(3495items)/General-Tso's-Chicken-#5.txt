DIRECTIONS: In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the egg, oil,
and cornstarch. In a blender or food processor, or by hand, combine
the ingredients for Sauce 1. In a small bowl, combine the ingredients
for Sauce 2.  Place the measured ingredients beside the wok in the
order in which they are to be placed in the wok. Warm 2 serving
dishes, one lined with paper towel, in a 250ยก oven.

Fill the wok to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2 inches with vegetable oil.
Heat the oil to high (400ยก), or until a day-old cube of bread browns
in just under 1 minute.  Heat another 4 minutes to stabilize the
temperature.  Put the chicken pieces into the oil one at a time until
all are in. Stir-fry 3 minutes. Remove the pieces from the oil,
draining well over the wok, and keep warm in the oven on the
paper-lined dish. Empty the oil from the wok. Reduce the heat to
medium (350ยก) and stir in Sauce 1. As soon as it bubbles, stir in the
chicken. Sprinkle Sauce 2 over the chicken, stir-fry 1 minute more,
then turn into the serving dish. Scrape the sauce over the chicken
and serve at once.
