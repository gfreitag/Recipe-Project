Here's a Chinese appetizer that looks great--crescents of deep fried
wonton skins stuffed with pork, shrimp and other goodies.

For Sauce:

1. Combine water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste and cornstarch in small
saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sauce
boils. Boil and stir 1 minute. . Keep sauce warm.

For Gow Gees:

2. Place mushrooms in bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand 30
minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess water.

3. Cut wonton wrappers into circles using 3-inch (8 cm) biscuit or
cookie cutter. Cover wrappers with plastic wrap to avoid excessive
drying.

4. Remove shells and back veins from shrimp. Finely chop shrimp, pork,
onions and mushrooms with cleaver, sharp knife or food processor.
Transfer chopped foods to large bowl. Add soy sauce, ginger and
garlic. Mix well.

5. Place level teaspoon (5 mL) pork mixture onto center of each wonton
circle. Brush edges with water. Fold circles in half over filling,
pressing edges firmly together to seal.

6. Heat vegetable oil in wok over high heat until it reaches 375
degrees F (190 C). Fry 8 to 10 gow gees at a time in hot oil until
golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on absorbent paper. Serve with Sweet
and Sour Sauce. From "Chinese Cooking Class Cookbook" by the Editors
