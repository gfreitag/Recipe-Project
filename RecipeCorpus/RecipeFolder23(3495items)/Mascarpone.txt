Title: Mascarpone
Categories: Italian, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb White wine vinegar
-=OR=- Lemon juice
1 qt Whipping cream
-(not ultra pasteurized)
Makes About 1 Pound

CHOOSE A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL that fits inside a large saucepan
without touching the bottom of the pan. Add water to the pan and
place the bowl in the pan so that the bowl touches the surface of the
water but still sits firmly on the rim of the pan. Remove the bowl,
place the pan on medium heat, and bring the water to a boil. Place
the cream in the bowl and place over the boiling water. Adjust the
heat under the pan to medium and heat the cream, checking the
temperature often with an instant-read thermometer, to 190F; stir
occasionally. Stir in the vinegar, continuing to stir gently until
the cream begins to curdle. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and
allow the curds to firm up for 10 minutes. Line a strainer or
colander with dampened cheesecloth, napkin, or coffee filters. Set
the strainer or colander over a bowl and carefully spoon the curds
into the strainer. Allow the mascarpone to cool to room temperature,
cover the strainer tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24
hours to allow the cheese to finish draining and become firm. Store
in the refrigerator in a tightly covered container. Use the
mascarpone within 3-or-4 days.
