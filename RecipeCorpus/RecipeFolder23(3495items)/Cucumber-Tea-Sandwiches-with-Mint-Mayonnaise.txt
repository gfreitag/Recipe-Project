MINT MAYONNAISE

In a blender or food processor, combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon
juice, and mint.  With motor running, add the oil in a slow stream and
blend until emulsified.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and
transfer to a bowl.

Spread each slice of bread generously on one side with the
mayonnaise. On half the slices, arrange an even layer of cucumber
slices.  Top with remaining bread slices.  Cut each sandwich into
quarters before serving. Makes 32 tea sandwiches.
