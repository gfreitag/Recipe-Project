let stand 2 days. Drain.  Discard all cucumbers that are not solid
and in good condition. Pack in sterilized jars. Cover with the

sufficient vinegar to cover the pickles add 3 chopped green peppers,
1/4 cup salt, 6 whole allspice, 6 peppercorns, 1 1/2 sticks cinnamon,
1 blade mace, 1 bay leaf, 1 small onion, minced, and 1 1/2
