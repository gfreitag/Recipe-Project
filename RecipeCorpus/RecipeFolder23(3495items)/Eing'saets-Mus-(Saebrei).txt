From the Allgaeu area.

From grandmother's more thrifty times; rarely encountered today.

In a skillet, melt the clarified butter, then add the flour.
Gradually add enough water to obtain a viscous batter.  Cook the
batter in the skillet until the top is done. The bottom will form a
crust, the so-called 'Schuepet'. In a separate skillet, brown the
onion in the remaining clarified butter. Pour the onion and fat over
the 'Saebrei'. This used to be served with a glass of milk.

Serves 4.
