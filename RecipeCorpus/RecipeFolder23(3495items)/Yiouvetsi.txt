6    Lamb leg or shoulder chops
-(thickly cut)
1/4 c  Butter or corn oil
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
1 c  Tomato puree
1 c  Chopped, peeled tomatoes
3    Cloves
Oven temperature: 180øC (350øF) Cooking time: 2 hours

Have meat retailer cut chops about 4 cm (1-1/4 inches) thick.
Alternatively purchace a leg of lamb and have it cut into 6 pieces.

Place lamb in a baking dish and spread or pour oil or butter on top.
Bake in a moderate oven for 20 minutes.

Add onion to dish and return to oven for further 10 minutes.  Add
tomato puree, chopped tomatoes, cloves, cinnamon bark and salt and
pepper to taste.  Baste meat with liquid and cook for futher hour
until meat is tender, adding a little of the water or stock if
necessary.

When meat is cooked add water or stock and stir in pasta.  Cook for
futhre 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, and adding a little more
liquid if mixture looks dry.  When pasta is tender, sprinkle cheese
over pasta and return to oven for 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.

NOTE: This is a popular restaurant dish in Greece, Cyprus and Egypt.
The pieces of meat are placed in individual casserole dishes after
the initial cooking, and the sauce, pasta and water or stock added to
each dish, then cooking completed.  In the home I suggest dividing
the meat and pasta ater it is cooked and just before adding the
cheese.  Return to oven for cheese to melt.
