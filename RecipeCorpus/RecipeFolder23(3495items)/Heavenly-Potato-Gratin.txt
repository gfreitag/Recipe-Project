Title: Heavenly Potato Gratin
Categories: Potato, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
Salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 c  Stock
1    Garlic
4 lg Baking potatoes
1/4 c  Parmesan, grated
Preheat the oven to 400. Peel the garlic and split it. Rub the sides
of the gratin pan with the garlic and leave it in the pan. Slice the
potato paper-thin.  Do not soak them in water at any time. Layer 1/3
of the potato slices in the gratin dish and sprinkle evenly with the
cheese and salt and pepper to taste.  Pour 1/3 of the stock over.
Repeat two times. Press the top with a spatula to press the top layer
into the liquid. Bake for approximately 1 1/2 hours, or until the
potatoes are tender, the liquid has cooked down to a thick sauce, and
the top is brown and crusty.
