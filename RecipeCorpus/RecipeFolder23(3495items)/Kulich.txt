3 tb Rum
1/2 c  Sugar

6 tb Butter,softened(3/4 stick)
3    Eggs
MMMMM------------------------SUGAR GLAZE-----------------------------
2 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Water
1 c  Confectioners' sugar
Reserved soaking rum
1. Soak raisins in rum for at least 30 or overnight.

2. Combine 1/2 teaspoon sugar along with yeast and water in small
bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

3. Beat together remaining sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, powdered
milk, salt and saffron, if using, and yeast mixture in large bowl
with mixer until blended. Add 2 cups of the flour and 1 tablespoon of
soaking rum, beating for 2 minutes at high speed.

4. Drain raisins and reserve rum for glaze. Stir raisins, almonds and
orange peel into dough with wooden spoon. Stir in enough of remaining
flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto floured surface and knead
until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

5. Place dough in greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover; let rise in
warm spot for 1 1/2-2 hours, until doubled. Grease well two 1 lb.
coffee cans. Line bottoms with rounds of waxed paper.

6. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Punch down; knead a few turns.
Divide in half and place in prepared cans. (They should be about
two-thirds full.) Let rise, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, or until
it has risen to top of can.

7. Preheat oven to moderate (350'F). Brush tops of breads lightly with
water.

8. Bake in lower third of preheated moderate over (350'F) for 35-40
minutes or until golden brown on top and long skewer inserted in
center comes out clean. Check after 25 minutes and tent with foil if
browning too quickly.

9. Using oven mitts, carefully remove the bread from the cans,
supporting top of bread and twisting off can. Cool upright on wire
rack to room temperature. Drizzle glaze over breads. Garnish with
candied orange peel and slivered almonds, if you wish.

SUGAR GLAZE: Stir together confectioners' sugar, reserved soaking rum,
lemon juice and water as need, in small bowl until good drizzling
consistency.
