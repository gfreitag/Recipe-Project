Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease six 6-oz custard cups. Heat

Cook the onion in the butter until tender but not browned.  Add the
halibut or cod pieces and the milk, then heat to simmering (Do NOT
boil) and reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until
the fish flakes easily with a fork.  Place the mixture in a food

sides, until smooth.  Mix the fish mixture, bread crumbs, slat,
nutmeg, pepper and the eggs together. Pour into the custard cups.

Pour very hot water into the pan to within 1/2 inch of the tops of
the cups. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven or until a knife
inserted in the center comes out clean.  Unmold and serve with the
Curry Sauce.
