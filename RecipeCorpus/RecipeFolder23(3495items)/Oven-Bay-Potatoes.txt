4 lg Maine potatoes

Place potato skins on a cookie sheet. Spoon equal amounts of crab
mixture into each potato half. Top the crab mixture with the potato
filling. Sprinkle the remaining Old Bay seasoning over the potato
halves. Bake at 350F for 5 to 10 minutes, or until heated through but
not dried out. Remove from oven and pour the melted butter over the
potato halves. Makes 4 servings of 2 potato halves each.
