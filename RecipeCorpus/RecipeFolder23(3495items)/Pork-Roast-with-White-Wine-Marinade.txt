1    Sprig fresh thyme
OR
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1    Bay leaf
8 sm New potatoes

1/4 ts Ginger, ground
3 1/2 lb Pork loin roast with bone
1 c  Sauvingnon Blanc wine,

1.  Two days ahead:  Coarsley grind fennel, coriander, and pepper in a
clean coffee grinder, electric minichopper, or with a mortar and
pestle. Combine ground spices with salt and ginger.  Rub this mixture
all over pork roast.  Put roast in a stainless steel, ceramic, or
glass bowl, pur in wine, and crumble herbs into bowl.  Marinate roast
in refrigerator, turning it several times a day to marinaate it
evenly. 2.  On cooking day:  Remove roast from refrigerator at least
1 hour before cooking.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Drain roast
thoroughly and discard marinade.
3.  Pat roast dry with paper towels and place it, fat side up on a
rack in a roasting pan.  Put roast in hot oven, reduce heat to 325
degrees F., and roast to an internal temperature of 170 degrees F.
(25 to 30 minutes per pound).  Add potatoes to roasting pan for the
last 30 minutes to roast in drippings.
4.  Let roast rest about 15 minutes before carving into 1/2-inch
slices. Serve with roast potatoes and a full-flavored dry white wine
or a lighter red wine.

Note:  You may use Gewirztraminer wine in place of Sauvignon Blanc.

Comments:

Two days of marinating in a mixture of white wine, spices, and herbs
gives roast a little of the flavor of wild boar.  Be sure to marinate
the pork in a nonaluminum container such as stainless steel, ceramic,
or glass.
