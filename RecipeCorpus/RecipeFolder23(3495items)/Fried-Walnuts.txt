Title: Fried Walnuts
Categories: Chinese, Appetizer, Stir fry
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Boiling water
1 1/2 c  Halved walnuts
Pour boiling water over nuts and let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Drain well.
Transfer to baking sheet. Sprinkle with sugar and mix well. Spread in
single layer and let stand overnight to dry.

Heat oil in wok or skillet until very hot. Add nuts in small batches
and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; watch carefully because
they can burn quickly. Drain on rack. Store in tightly covered
container in cool, dry place.

(Oil can be strained and used several more times for this recipe.)
