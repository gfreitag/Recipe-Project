Cook macaroni in boiling, salted water until just tender.  Drain and
return to pan.

Melt butter until golden brown and pour over macaroni.  Add 1/2 cup
of the cheese, the nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste and toss well.
Leave until cool, add eggs and toss again.  Keep aside.

Make meat sauce.  Gently fry onion and garlic in butter until onion is
soft, increase heat and add ground beef.  Stir well and cook until
meat begins to brown.  Add remaining meat sauce ingredients, cover
and simmer over gentle heat for 20 minutes.

Make cream sauce.  Melt butter in a saucepan, stir in flour and cook
gently for 2 minutes.  Add milk all at once and bring to the boil,
stirring constantly.  Boil gently for 1 minute.  Add nutmeg, salt and
pepper to taste and cool a little before stirring in beaten egg.  Add
1/2 cup of this sauce to the cooked meat sauce.

To assemble Pastitso, butter a 33 x 23 x 8 cm (13 x 9 x 3 inch) oven
dish. Spoon half of the prepared macaroni evenly in the base and top
with the meat sauce.  Cover with remaining macaroni, levelling top.

Pour on cream sauce and spread to completely cover macaroni.  Sprinkle
remaining cheese on top and cook in a moderate oven for 50 minutes
until golden brown.  Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting into
squares to serve.
