Title: Rosti (Swiss-Style Potato Cake)
Categories: European, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 tb Water or milk
1 3/4 lb Potatoes (see below)
3 oz Butter, lard or bacon fat
This is a favorite dish of German-speaking Switzerland. Besides being
served as a side dish with meat or fish, it is sometimes eaten on its
own, for lunch or even breakfast, with milky coffee.

The potatoes should be boiled in their jackets the day before. These
should be waxy potatoes of the potato-salad kind. The next day, peel
them and grate them on the coarsest blade of the grater. Heat a large
heavy frying pan, and let the fat get hot: then put in the potatoes,
sprinkle with salt, and fry, turning them constantly. When they have
soaked up the butter or whatever, add more. Now form a "cake" by
pushing the potatoes from the edges of the pan into the middle and
flattening down the top.

Sprinkle with the water or milk, reduce heat, and cover with a lid or
inverted dish. Shake the covered pan occasionally to keep the
potatoes from burning, and leave on low heat for at least 15 minutes.
The potatoes must stick together, but not to the bottom of the pan.
When cooked, turn the cake out onto a plate, bottom side up, and
serve. (Or alternately, brown the other side as well.) . Variations:
(1) Saute 2 T chopped onions in the fat before adding the potatoes.
Don't let them brown. Also note that in this version, the potatoes
will need less fat. (2) Saute 2 - 3 1/2 oz. diced bacon before adding
potatoes. You won't need any extra salt. (3) Sprinkle cooked potatoes
with grated cheese before serving, and heat it briefly in the oven to
melt it.
