KEEP-ON-HAND SNOW CONES

Freeze orange juice (or any other flavored juice) in ice cube trays,
Pop frozen juice cubes in a plastic bag to store. Put three to six of
these cubes at a time in a blender. Turn blender on and off until
cubes reach snowy consistency. Pile into a cup to serve.

The whole batch blended at once will keep its carnival consistency
stored in a container in the freezer. Kids can serve themselves.
Adding a little water makes it a "slush". Even kids who don't care
for orange juice like it this way.
