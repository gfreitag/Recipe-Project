Title: Chili Pickled Cabbage - Kim Chee *
Categories: Asian, Condiment
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Finely Chopped Fresh Ginger
1/2 c  Light Soy Sauce
1/2 c  White Vinegar
2 ts Sugar Or More To Taste
Sesame Oil
2 lb Chinese Cabbage
1 tb Salt
2 tb Chopped Green Onion
2 ts Crushed Garlic
1 tb Chili Powder
Chop the cabbage coarsely and place in a glass dish.  Sprinkle with
the salt and let stand for 3 to 4 hours; the cabbage will wilt.  Mash
with the fingers until the cabbage is still softer, then drain off
excess liquid and add the remaining ingredients except the sesame oil.

Transfer to a large glass jar, seal and leave in a cool place for at
least 24 hours before using.  It will keep for up to a week in the
refrigerator. Sprinkle with a few drops of sesame oil before using.
