Karen Mintzias
4    Quinces (about 1 kg)
3 c  Water
4 c  Sugar
2    Thin lemon rind strips
*Note: almonds should be toasted.

Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours

Wash quinces well and rub off all fuzz.  Peel, quarter and remove
core. Place peels and cores in a pan with 2 cups water and boil for
20 minutes. Grate quince quarters and place in a heavy preserving pan
with remaining water.  Leave aside until peels are boiled.  Do not be
concerned if quince discolours.

Strain liquid from peels into a measuring jug and make up to 2 cups
with water.  Add this to grated quince with the sugar, lemon rind and
cinnamon bark or washed geranium leaves.  Place over medium heat and
stir occasionally with a wooden spoon until sugar is dissolved.
Bring to the boil and boil fairly rapidly for 1 hour or until it gels
when tested on a cold saucer.

Stir in almonds and lemon juice and boil 1 minute longer.  Ladle into
hot, sterilized jars and seal when cold.

Note:  As the peel and core contain pectin, the setting ingredients
for jellies and preserves, it is advisable that these be boiled to
extract the pectin.
