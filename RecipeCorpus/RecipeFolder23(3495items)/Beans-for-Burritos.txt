Title: Beans for Burritos
Categories: Beans, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
3    Cloves garlic,
-minced/pressed
1/2 ts Chili powder
4 tb Salsa or to taste
1 lb Pink beans
1 sm Can Ortega green chiles,
-chopped
1 ts Salt
1 lg Onion, chopped
Soak the beans overnight, changing water several times.  Put beans in
crock-pot and cover with an inch or so of water.  Add salt, onion,
garlic, and chili powder.  Cook on low until beans are soft (about 18
hours?  I forget).

When beans are cooked, ladle off and reserve some of the liquid from
the top.  Mash the beans well.  (I never do this as well as I'd like;
I've tried a potato masher and an empty iced-tea jar.)  Add reserved
liquid as necessary for consistency.  (I never have to add any,
myself.)  Stir in the chopped chiles and the salsa; heat through.
