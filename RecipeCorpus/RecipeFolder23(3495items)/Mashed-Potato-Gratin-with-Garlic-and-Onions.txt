Title: Mashed Potato Gratin with Garlic and Onions
Categories: Potato, Herbs/spice, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/4 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Gruyere
4 lg Idaho potatoes
2 lg Garlic heads, roasted
2 lg Onions, baked
Remove the papery covering of the garlic heads, but do not peel and
do not separate the cloves.  Wrap well in foil and put them in the
oven. Put the onions on a double sheet of foil, but do not wrap them;
put them in the oven. Pierce the potatoes in several places with a
thin skewer or the tines of a fork.  Put them directly on the oven
rack. Bake the garlic for one hour and the onions and the potatoes
for an hour and a half at 425. After an hour pull out the garlic
heads, unwrap, and let cool for 5 minutes. Separate the cloves and
squeeze them over a bowl so the softened garlic pops out into the
bowl. After 1 1/4  hours, pull out the onions and potatoes.  If the
onions are not very soft (almost collapsed) put them back in for a
few minutes. Perforate the potatoes lengthwise and crosswise with the
tines of a fork and squeeze.  Scoop the potato flesh into a bowl and
mash it with a potato masher. With a sharp knife, cut off the stem
and root ends of the onions.  Remove the skin and the first layer.
Put the onions in a food processor and puree. Combine the potatoes,
garlic, onion, 1/4 cup of cream, and salt and pepper in the bowl of a
mixer. Beat (with the paddle blade) until smooth and blended, then
scrape the mixture into a large gratin bowl.  Sprinkle the top with
cheese. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point and kept in the
refrigerator, covered, for a day or so. Bring to room temperature
before proceeding.) Reduce the oven temperature to 350. Pour the
remaining cream over the mixture. Bake, uncovered, for 40 - 50
minutes, or until the top is browned and bubbly and the cream has
cooked down to a very thick suace-like consistency. Try to arrange to
have some leftovers; this is very good when it is cold.
