moderate heat for about 5 minutes until browned on all sides.  Remove

Add the onion and garlic to the pan and fry gently for about 5

Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the wine, then add the
tomatoes and tomato paste and mix well.  Let the mixture bubble for a
few minutes.

Meanwhile, pound the spices with a pestle in a mortar.  Add to the
casserole with the water and stir well to mix.  Cover the pan and
simmer for about 45 - 60 minutes until the chicken is tender.

Add the artichokes (if using) about 10 minutes, before the end of
cooking time, to heat through.  Taste and adjust seasoning, stir in
the parsley or cilantro and serve immediately.
