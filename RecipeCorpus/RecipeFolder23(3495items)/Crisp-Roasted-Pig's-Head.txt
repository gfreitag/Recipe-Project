Title: Crisp Roasted Pig's Head
Categories: Chinese, Pork
Yield: 6 servings
Or
1/2 c  Oyster sauce
1/4 c  Bourbon
1 c  Honey, combined with
1 c  Boiling water
1    Pig's head, cleaned and
-tongue removed
1 ts 5-spice powder
2 tb Salt
1/2 c  Mien see (ground brown bean
-sauce)
Remove any hair on head by singeing over and open flame or plucking.
Scrub well (using a vegetable brush, if desired) and then sprinkle
with salt, rubbing it into the skin. Rinse well with cool water; pat
dry. Remove any excess fat.

Place head in a colander in the sink and pour a kettleful of boiling
water over. Let cool.

Combine the 5-spice powder, salt, bean sauce and bourbon. Slash the
meat on underside of head and rub half of the spice mixture into the
meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture onto the skin. Place head
upright on a rack in a large baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees for
1-1/2 hours. Lower heat to 325 degrees and continue cooking for an
additional 2 hours, or until the meat is cooked through, basting the
skin well every 30 minutes with the honey-water mixture. (Cooking
time will depend on the size of the head.) If ears begin to brown too
quickly during cooking period, wrap them with foil.

When head is done, remove to platter and garnish with water- cress or
coriander. Chop head into pieces and serve with sweet vegetable
relish or plum sauce.

[I'd definitely serve with spiced salt and Chinese mustard and minced
green onions for dipping too.]
