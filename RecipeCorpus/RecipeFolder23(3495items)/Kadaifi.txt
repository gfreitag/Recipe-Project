Karen Mintzias
1 lb Commercial raw kadaifi dough
1/2 c  Sweet butter; melted
1 1/2 c  Finely chopped almonds *
3 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
*Note: Use blanched almonds.

Open the raw kadaifi dough to the air for 10 to 15 minutes.  Spread
half the pastry evenly over the bottom of a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking
pan and brush with half the butter.  Meanwhile, combine the almonds,
1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and orange juice in a small
bowl.  (The orange juice will make the mixture like a paste that can
be spread with a knife.) Spread the almond mixture over the kadaifi
and cover with the remaining dough. Brush with the remaining butter
and bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40 minutes or slightly
longer, until golden on top.

Meanwhile, boil the remaining 3 cups sugar with water for 5 minutes.
Stir in the honey and lemon juice, bring to a boil and keep hot.
When done, remove the pastry to a rack to cool in the pan, then spoon
the hot syrup over the pastry.  Cover with a dry towel and allow to
cool thoroughly. When cool, cut into square or diamond shapes of any
desired size.  Dust with additional ground cinnamon just before
serving on dessert plates.
