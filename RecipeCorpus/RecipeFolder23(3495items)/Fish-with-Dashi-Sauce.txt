4 T  Wine rice (subst. rice

1 1/2 T  Water chestnut powder
Marinate the fish steaks in wine rice for 1/2 to 1 hour. Put the miso
in a small saucepan (use less if a dark salty miso). Add 1/4 cup
dashi slowly, whisking to blend in the miso. Add the remaining miso,
2 tbs soy sauce, the ginger and freshly ground white pepper. Remove
the fish from the marinade and add marinade to the dashi mixture.
Bring to the boil. Stir the water chestnut and sake together and
whisk into the dashi. Simmer until it becomes a sauce -like
consistency. Taste for seasoning, adding more soy sauce and or pepper
to taste. Keep hot, but below the simmer while broiling the fish.
Preheat an oven to 300!. Pat the fish dry and salt lightly. Broil or
grill at very high heat for 2 minutes on each side. Put on heatproof
serving dish in the oven for 3-4 minutes while finishing the sauce.
Do not let it overcook. Sable or sturgeon should still adhere to the
bone and be pink in the center. Swordfish is best if cooked to medium
rare or rare.

When ready to serve add the chopped scallion to the sauce and pour
over the fish, sprinkling with the chopped coriander.Excellent with
polenta.
