Stephen Ceideburg
4 c  Medium coconut milk
1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
3    Quarter-sized pieces dried
-galangal (kha), or 6
4 stalks fresh lemon grass, bruised, cut into 2-inch lengths 6 fresh
Serrano chiles, sliced into rounds 1 large whole chicken breast, cut
into 1/2-inch pieces (with or without bones, see note) 4 tablespoons
fish sauce (nam pla) 5 fresh Kaffir lime leaves (makrut), if
available 2 fresh limes, juice 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves

Combine coconut milk, chicken stock, galangal, lemon grass and 4 of
the chiles in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
for 20 minutes.  Strain stock; discard galangal and lemon grass.
Return stock to a boil, add chicken and simmer until tender, about 2
minutes.  Add fish sauce, citrus leaves and remaining chiles.  Stir
in the lime juice. Garnish with coriander.

NOTE:  I like to use boned chicken breast if I'm cooking for guests.
For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
is tender.
