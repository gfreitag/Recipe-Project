makes up a marinade of lemon juice and good quality olive oil,
oregano and/or thyme, pepper, crushed garlic & maybe a little dry
white wine. Marinate the pork overnight, then grill til just cooked,
not dry. Eat as is, straight from the skewers, or remove meat and
serve in pita bread pockets, with tomato wedges, onion slices, and
Tzatziki, passing salt and additional freshly ground black pepper.
