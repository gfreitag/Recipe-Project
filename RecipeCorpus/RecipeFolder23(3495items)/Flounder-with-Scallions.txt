Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 6 servings
Fresh ground black pepper
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Fresh thin slice mushrooms
1 c  Chopped scallions with tops
1 tb Soy sauce
1 lb Flounder fillets
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1    Egg white
2 tb Dry sherry
1/4 ts Ground ginger
Cut fish into uniform 1 x 2-inch pieces. Dry fish pieces. Put
cornstarch on a plate. Combine egg white, 1 tablespoon of the sherry,
ginger and pepper in a small bowl. Dip fish first in cornstarch to
coat thoroughly, then in egg white mixture.

Heat oil in wok or large skillet. When oil is very hot, add coated
fish pieces and fry them quickly until they are golden brown on both
sides, keeping them moving and turning them as they cook. Remove fish
to a warm serving dish. Add mushrooms and scallions to wok or skillet
and stir-fry a minute or two. Add remaining sherry and soy sauce,
stir and pour contents of pan over fish. Serve at once.
