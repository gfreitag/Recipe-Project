Directions: Boil the potatoes in their jackets and allow them to cool

very well.) Peel the potatoes and cut them into 3/4 inch dice. Break
up the cauliflower into chunky florets about 1 1/2 inches acress at
the head and about 1 1/2 inches long. Soak the florets in a bowl of
water for 30 minutes. Drain. Heat the oil an a large (preferably
non-stick) frying pan over a medium flame When hot, put in the whole
cumin seeds. Let the seeds sizzle for 3-4 seconds Now put in the
cauliflower and stir it about for 2 minutes. Let the cauli- flower
brown in spots. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for about 4-6
minutes or until cualiflower is almost done but still has a hint of
crispness to it. Put in the diced potatoes, ground cumin, coriander,
turmeric,cayenne, green chili,ground roast cumin, salt, and some
black pepper. Stir gently to mix. Continue to cook uncovered on low
heat for another 3 minutes or until pot- atoes are heated through.
Stir gently as you do so. This delicious recipe is by Madhur Jaffrey
from her BBC book and series "Indian Cookery".She refers to it as a
"comfort food". It is extremely addic- tive, and you always wish you
had made more! Reheats well. Liz Parkinson
