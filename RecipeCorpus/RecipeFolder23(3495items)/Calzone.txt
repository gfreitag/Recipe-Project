Title: Calzone
Categories: Italian, Cheese/eggs, Sausage
Yield: 3 servings
-or diced
6 oz Creamy goat cheese
3 oz Sliced prosciutto or cooked
-ham, cut into strips
3 tb Chopped chives
1 tb Finely minced fresh garlic
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
1 c  Warm water
1/2 ts Sugar
1 pk Active dry yeast
3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour,
-divided
2 tb Oil
1/2 ts Salt
12 oz Mozzarella cheese, shredded
Combine water and sugar in large bowl; sprinkle with yeast. Let stand
5 minutes to soften. Add 1 1/2 cups flour; beat with electric mixer
until smooth. Stir in oil and salt. Gradually blend in enough of
remaining flour with wooden spoon to make moderately stiff dough.
Turn out onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth. Return to
bowl; cover and let rise in warm place until doubled. Punch down
dough; divide into 3 equal portions. Roll one portion on lightly
floured surface to 9-inch circle. Place 1/3 of mozzarella on one side
of dough; dot with 1/3 of goat cheese and top with 1/3 of prosciutto.
Repeat with remaining dough , cheeses and prosciutto. Mix chives and
garlic; sprinkle over filling. Moisten edges of dough with water and
fold over to enclose filling, pressing edges firmly together. Place
on lightly greased baking sheets. Let rise 30 to 45 minutes or until
dough feels light to the touch. Cut slit in each calzone to allow
steam to escape. Preheat oven to 375 deg F. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or
until browned. Remove from oven; brush tops with oil. Sprinkle each
with 2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese. Serve warm. Posted by Linda
