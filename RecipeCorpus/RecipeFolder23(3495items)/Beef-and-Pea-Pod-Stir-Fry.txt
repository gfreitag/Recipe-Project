Categories: Chinese, Beef, Stir fry
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Cold water
4 ts Cornstarch
1 pk Frozen pea pods (8 oz)
1/2 c  Cherry tomatoes, quartered
1/3 c  Sliced water chestnuts,
-drained (1/2 can)
Hot cooked rice (Optional)
3/4 lb Beef top round steak
3 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Fresh ginger, grated
1    Clove garlic, minced
3    Green onions, bias cut into
-1/2-inch lengths
Partially freeze beef and thinly slice across the grain into bite-size
strips.

For marinade, in a medium mixing bowl combine soy sauce, vinegar,
ginger, and garlic.  Stir in the strips of beef.  Cover and let stand
at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Drain meat and reserve marinade.

Preheat a 10-inch microwave browning dish on High for 5 minutes. Add
cooking oil and swirl to coat the dish.  Add the strips of beef.
Micro-cook, uncovered, on High 2 for to 3 minutes until the meat is
tender, stirring every minute.  Remove meat with a slotted spoon,
reserving juices. Set meat aside.

Combine reserved juices and reserved marinade in a measuring cup. Add
water, if necessary, to equal 3/4 cup total.  Stir in green onions.
Return mixture to the browning dish and cook, covered, on High until
onions are crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir together water and
cornstarch and add to the green onion mixture.  Cook, uncovered, on
High for 2 to 4 minutes or until thickened and bubbly, stirring every
minute until slightly thickened, then every 30 seconds.

Stir in the cooked meat, peapods, tomatoes, and water chestnuts. Cook,
uncovered, on High for 2 to 4 minutes until heated through.  Serve
over hot cooked rice, if desired.
