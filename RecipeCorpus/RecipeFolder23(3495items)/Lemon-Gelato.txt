Title: Lemon Gelato
Categories: Italian, Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Salt
2 2/3 c  Half-and-half
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
6 md Lemons
1 1/3 c  Sugar
6    Egg yolks
1 1/3 c  Heavy cream
PREPARATION:  Grate the zest of 6 lemons and set aside in a bowl with
the sugar.  OR, use a vegetable peeler to remove 3/4 cup zest from
the lemons and process the lemon strips with the sugar in a food
processor until zest is minced, about 30 seconds.  Set lemons aside.

COOKING:  Whisk the egg yolks with the cream and salt in a heatproof
mixing bowl.  Put the half-and-half and lemon-sugar in a medium non-
aluminum saucepan.  Bring liquid to a simmer, stirring to dissolve
the sugar. Remove pan from heat.  Slowly whisk the hot half-and-half
into the egg yolk mixture.  Then return the partially cooked custard
to the saucepan. Stir constantly over medium-low heat until mixture
begins to thicken slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 5
minutes (the approximate consistency of unwhipped heavy cream).  Pour
hot custard into a bowl without straining. Stir in the vanilla.  Put
a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to
prevent skin from forming. Set custard aside at room temperature to
cool.  (Can cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 48
hours.)

FREEZING:  Squeeze 3/4 cup juice from the lemons and stir juice into
cooled custard.  Transfer the custard mixture to an ice cream maker
and freeze according to manufacrurer's instructions.

Makes about 1 1/2 quarts.
