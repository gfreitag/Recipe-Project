Title: Bubbies Chicken Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Poultry, Jewish, Chicken
Yield: 8 servings
3    Celery  stalks
1    Parsnip,
1 bn Carrot
1 bn Dill
1 bn Parsley; (a bunch of each).
Large Fowl; 6 lbs
1    Lg Kettle (10-12 qt.)
-Water; cover and bring
-to a boil
-Prepare
1    Lg Onion,
Put the chicken in the pot and cover with water. When the soup comes
to a boil, skim off the top, add the veggies, turn down to a simmer.
Keep the lid askew, and season to taste. It's wonderful and freezes
well. Hint: put the dill and parsley in the mesh onion bag, to make
for easier removal.
Most would say to throw the veggies out, but I like to eat the
carrots and the onion. The chicken is great in sandwiches or salad. I
love it hot by itself, but you can put pieces in the soup when you
serve. Add rice or noodles (cooked elsewhere) and of course there's
always matzo balls. Enjoy,

NOTE:  If you can't find a fowl, use a Perdue Oven Roaster, cut up. A
butcher gave me this tip once and I now use it all the time. He cut
it up too.
