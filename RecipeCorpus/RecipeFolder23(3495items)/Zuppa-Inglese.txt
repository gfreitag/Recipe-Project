BRING THE MILK and half the sugar to a boil in a large saucepan.
Whisk the egg yolks in mixing bowl and beat in the remaining sugar.
Sift in the flour and beat it in. Beat 1/3 of the boiling milk into
the egg mixture. Return the remaining milk to a boil and beat in the
egg mixture, continuing to beat until the pastry cream thickens and
comes to a boil. Cook, beating about 1 minute. Remove the cream from
the heat and pour half into each of 2 bowls. Stir the orange zest and
vanilla extract into one and the chocolate and cinnamon into the
other. Press plastic wrap against the surface of each and refrigerate
until cold.

FOR THE SYRUP: Bring the water and sugar to a boil in a small pan.
Cool and add the rum. Cut the Pane di Spagna into thin vertical
slices. Place a layer of the slices in the bottom of a glass bowl and
moisten with the syrup. Spread with half the orange cream. Cover with
another layer of the Pane di Spagna and moisten with the syrup and
cover with a layer of the chocolate cream. Repeat with the remaining
ingredients, ending with a layer of the cake slices and moistening
with the remaining syrup. Whip the cream and spread on the top.
Decorate with some chocolate shavings and the candied fruit.
