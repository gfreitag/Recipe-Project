Title: Fred's Lasagne
Categories: Italian, Pasta
Yield: 6 servings
-(or 1/4 tsp dried)
1/2 ts Msg
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Mushrooms, sliced
1/2 lb Lasagne noodles
1 lb Ricotta cheese
1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1 lb Ground beef, lean
2 tb Olive oil
3 1/2 c  Tomatoes
16 oz Tomato sauce
1 lg Onion, diced
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Rosemary leaves
1 ts Basil leaves, fresh, crushed
Saute ground beef in hot oil until meat loses its pink color.  Add
tomatoes, tomato sauce, seasonings and mushrooms. Mix well; cook
slowly about 2 hours or until sauce is thickened. Cook noodles
following directions on package; drain, rinse in cold water and
separate. In a buttered 3-quart baking dish make two layers of the
noodles, meat sauce, ricotta, slices of Mozzarella cheese and
Parmesan cheese, in this order, using about half of each for each
layer. Bake in 350 F oven 30 minutes or until bubbly. Serves 6 to 7.
NOTE: Pepperoni may be added to meat sauce if desired. You may double
the recipe for sauce; use half in making the lasagne, as above, and
serve the remainder, cooked down until quite thick, in a sauce boat
along with the lasagne.
