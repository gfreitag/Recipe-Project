large pot. Put a fourth of the meatballs in the broth and poach until
they rise to the top. Remove and keep warm.  Repeat with the
remaining meatballs. About 20 minutes prior to serving, return stock
to a boil and add the meatballs. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes (Note:
Meatballs will be slightly pink in the center even after the second
cooking.) Season with salt and black pepper to taste.  Turn heat to
medium low.  Add the watercress and green onions. Cook, uncovered,
for a few minutes until watercress is slightly wilted and bright
green in color.  Add the remaining water chestnuts and cook for 1
minute so that they remain crisp. Serve immediately.
