1.  Preheat broiler according to manufacturer's directions.  As
broiler heats, season meat with salt and pepper, if desired.  Shape
into 4 patties. (For thin hamburgers, place patties between 2 sheets
of waxed paper and flatten with a rolling pin.)
2.  Place patties on a lightly greased rack of broiler pan and broil 4
inches from heat until desired doneness is reached.  The timing will
vary with the thickness of the hamburgers.
3.  Top each of 4 slices French bread with 2 slices of cheese; broil 1
minute.  Top cheese with a slice of tomato, a cooked burger, a fried
or poached egg and olives or chives.  Cover each sandwich with a
second slice of bread.  For more zest, add chopped chiles or salsa.
