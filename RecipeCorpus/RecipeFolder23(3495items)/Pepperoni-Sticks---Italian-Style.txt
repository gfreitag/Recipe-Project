Title: Pepperoni Sticks - Italian Style
Categories: Beef, Pork, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
2 oz Allspice
5 oz Ground anise seed
10 lb Ice water
3 1/2 lb Salt
5 oz Sugar
4 oz Cure
2 oz Ground hot red pepper
Ingredients for 100 lbs.

Meat in Pounds Boneless cowmeat 50 pounds, Beef cheeks 20 pounds, Beef
flanks or plates 30 pounds.

Grinding and Mixing: Grind all the meats thru a 3/16" grinder plate.
Remove to mixer and add all the ingredients mixing evenly, regrind
thru 1/8" grinder plate. The meat is now ready for stuffing. Stuffing:

It is essential that the meat is well chilled to avoid smearing the
meat. The meat should be stuffed into 24 to 26 mm lamb casings.
Smoking:

Preheat smokehouse to 125 degrees F and place pepperoni in smoker.
Have dampers wide open without smoke until the casings are dry.
Close the dampers 1/4 open and apply a heavy smoke raising the
temperature to 140 degrees.  Hold this temperature until the internal
temperature of the product reaches 130 degrees.  When using PORK,
raise the temperature to 150 degrees and hold until the internal
temperatue reaches 138 degrees.  Remove from the smokehouse and chill
with cold tap water until the internal temperature is reduced 105
degrees to 110 degrees.  Return to the cold smokehouse at 110 degrees
and apply a heavy smoke for at least 12 hours or overnight.  Leave
dampers 1/4 open.

Drying: The drying room should be kept at 60 degrees to 65 degrees
and a relative humidity of 70%.  The drying time will vary because of
the amount of moisture that has been removed from the sausage during
smoking.   It usually takes 3 to 4 days to make a satisfactory
pepperoni.  When fully dry, the pepperoni will yield from 50 to 55%
of the original product.

Alternate Drying Method without smoking: Hold pepperoni at 70 degrees
for about 2 days maintaining a relative humidity of about 75%. The
product should be kept in a cooler for at least 20 days from the time
the cure had been added to the pepperoni.  Be sure that casins used
are not over 1-3/8" in diameter as this formula applies only to
casings below this range.
