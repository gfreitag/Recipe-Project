Title: Barbecued Salmon Fillets
Categories: Seafood, Bbq/grill, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 1/2 t  Worcestershire sauce
1 t  Sweet basil
1/2 t  Garlic powder
-salmon fillets
1 c  Melted butter or margarine
1 1/2 T  Soya sauce
1 T  Parsley
1 t  Oregano
-salt & pepper
Combine all ingredients except fillets to make barbecue sauce. Brush
fillets with sauce and place on grill over hot coals. Broil equally
on each side, about 10 minutes for each inch of thickness. Brush on
more sauce before each turn and when the fish is done. Leftover
barbecue sauce can be stored in refrigerator for weeks, but will need
to be warmed slowly to melt butter during later use.
