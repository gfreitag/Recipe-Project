1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Hot chili paste
1 ts Minced ginger root
FINISHING:
40    Dumpling or gyozo skins
Cornstarch for dusting
1 c  Safflower or corn oil
FILLING:

3 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Rice wine or sake
1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
2 tb Cornstarch
Plunge the water chestnuts briefly into hot water, refresh quickly in
cold water, and drain thoroughly.  In a large mixing bowl, combine
all of the filling ingredients.  Stir the mixture vigorously in one
direction until well combines.  Set aside.

Combine the ingredients for the hot chili sauce with 2 tablespoons of
water and transfer to a serving bowl.

To finish:  Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center of a
dumpling skin.  Moisten the edge with water, fold over in half to
enclose the filling, and press the edges to seal. Transfer the
dumplings to a tray that has been dusted with cornstarch.

Heat a wok or a deep skillet and add the oil.  Heat to 350 F and add
7 or 8 of the dumplings.  Fry, turning constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes
until a deep golden brown.  Remove with a long- handled strainer and
drain briefly in a colander.  Transfer to absorbent paper.  Fry the
remaining dumplings in the same manner, reheating the oil between
batches.  Arrange the dumplings on a platter and serve warm with the
hot chili sauce.

Makes 40 dumplings.
