Marinated meat, skewered and barbecued, is popular throughout the
Orient; much of the world, for that matter.  This recipe from central
Asia, where lamb reigns supreme, is seasoned with a piquant marinade.

Combine all ingredients and marinate lamb cubes for 2 hours in covered
bowl. Drain lamb, reserving marinade for basting during barbecuing.
Skewer lamb; you should have enough for two skewers per serving.
Barbecue until browned, but still juicy.  Overcooking will dull fla-
vors. Serve with nang (Moslem bread) or shao bing (baked sesame
rolls).
