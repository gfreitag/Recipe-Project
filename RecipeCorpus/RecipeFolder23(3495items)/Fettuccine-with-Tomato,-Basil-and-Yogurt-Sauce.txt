Indian cuisine is one of John's favorites.  This pasta sauce is
basically a variation on the Indian raita, a cooling, soothing
combination of cucumber, cilantro and yogurt.  Do not substitute
non-fat yogurt for low-fat: over the heat of the pasta, the former
becomes too runny. Have all the ingredients 1 lb Fettuccine cooked al
dente according to package directions

In a large bowl combine the basil, parsley, scallions and tomatoes,
and toss well to mix Spoon the yogurt over the herbs and vegetables
and blend well. Taste and add salt and pepper if necessary.

Dive the hot fettuccine among four warm bowls.  Spoon the sauce over
it and serve immediately.
