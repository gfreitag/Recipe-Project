Title: A Norwegian Coffee Cake  "Kringlas",
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, European
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  BUTTERMILK.
1 ts SODA.
3 c  FLOUR.
2 1/2 ts BAKING POWDER.
1 ts SALT.
-CONRAD FEIERABEND (TSNC45A)
1/2 c  MARGARINE.
1 c  SUGAR.
1 ts VANILLA.
1    EGG.
Try mixing Vanilla and egg  beat until mixed. Add the Buttermilk and
the Soda; (I have used 7up) and sift the dry ingredients into this.
add the rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the
refrigerator chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the
dough into long strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a
pretzel) put them back into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when
they have raised to approximately what looks to be the right hight.
Bake in a 450 deg pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, (
May vary with the weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be
a light brown before you remove them. Refrigeration is one of the
keys of "KRINGLA" making. They must be refrigerated in order for them
to get the flavor, you could bake them without refrigeration but you
lose a lot of the flavor. You can also use.

A:  OATMEAL. B: RAISINS. C: WHOLE WHEAT.

You can fill them with your favorite filling, Cream Cheese, Jelly,
ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast. They are not too sweet, and
definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry Bagel lovers, VBG). It is
a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too sweet, and also do not
have too many calories. This recipe came from a fella from the town
of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who started baking and
selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this is an original
recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the Grandmas). Ive
tried Nuts, and love the cream Cheese one, You could even use Custard
Filling, Ive also used Different flavored oils like Pure orange oil,
Butterscotch, several Berries types. and they turned out just great.
Hope you enjoy them. Formatted by Elaine Radis
