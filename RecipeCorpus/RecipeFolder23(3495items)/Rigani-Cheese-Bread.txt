Karen Mintzias
1 tb Active dry yeast
1 c  Tepid (110 F) water
3 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Fine-grain sea salt
3 c  Whole wheat flour, or more
Sprinkle the yeast over the water and set aside in a warm place until
foamy, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and
the salt.

Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the center,
and pour in the yeast mixture.  Knead 10 minutes, adding additional
flour if necessary to make a firm elastic dough.  Transfer to a
lightly oiled bowl, tightly cover with plastic wrap, and set aside
for 2 hours in a warm draft-free spot.

Knead in the rigani, mint, and feta until evenly distributed
throughout the dough.  Lightly oil a heavy baking sheet and place the
dough in the center. Form into a round loaf and flatten to a
thickness of 2 inches. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside
for 1 hour in a warm draft-free spot. The dough will rise only
slightly.

Heat the oven to 350 F.

With a sharp thin blade, slash the top of the loaf diagonally in 2 or
3 parallel lines, brush with the remaining olive oil, and bake 25
minutes. Brush with the beaten egg yolk and bake 15 minutes longer,
or until the bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped
on the bottom.
