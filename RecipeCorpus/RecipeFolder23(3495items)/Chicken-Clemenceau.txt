Garlicky and good.  Peas and potatoes included.  Coat chicken lightly
with flour.  Brown in butter and oil at medium high heat. Lower heat,
add head of garlic and saute until aromatic. Pour off fat except 2
tablespoons and add 1/2 cup each of water and wine. Simmer over low
heat 1-1/2 hours, adding water and wine as needed. About 15 minutes
before serving, heat 1/2 cup of oil in skillet and pan fry potatoes
and additional garlic. When nearly done add peas and heat through.
Remove vegetables with slotted spoon.  Add to chicken just before
serving and heat briefly to blend flavors.  There should be enough
sauce, of a glaze-like consistency, to coat the chicken and
vegetables lightly.
