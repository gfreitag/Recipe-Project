Karen Mintzias
8 c  Milk
1 c  Raw long-grain white rice
3/4 c  Sugar
4 tb Butter
In a heaavy saucepan, pour the cold milk, add the rice, sugar, and
butter. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently until thickened,
approximately 1 hour, adding cinnamon stick and cloves for flavor, if
desired, during the last 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat, stir in
the vanilla, then remove the cinnamon stick and cloves.

Beat the eggs lightly in a small bowl, then add one tablespoon of the
hot pudding mixture into the eggs, stir and repeat twice.  Add the
egg mixture into the pudding, stirring until mixed thoroughly.  Pour
into individual serving dishes or large serving bowl.  Sprinkle with
ground cinnamon, cool, then chill.  Serve cold.

Note:  You may use a vanilla bean, added with the rice, instead of
stick cinnamon and cloves, or substitute grated lemon rind for all
the other flavorings.
