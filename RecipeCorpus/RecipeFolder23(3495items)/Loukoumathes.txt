30 g  Compressed yeast; -=OR=-
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 c  Milk; lukewarm
1 tb Caster sugar
1    Egg; beaten
Dissolve yeast in 2 tablespoons of the lukewarm milk.  Add remaining
milk, sugar, egg and lukewarm melted butter.

Sift flour and salt into a warm bowl and gradually stir in mixed
liquids. Beat until smooth and continue beating for 1 minute.  Cover
with folded cloth and leave in a warm place for 1-1/2 hours until
batter doubles in bulk with bubbles on the surface.

Stir well then drop teaspoonfuls into deep, hot oil (190øC or 375øF)
~ do 4 to 5 at a time.  Turn puffs to brown evenly and remove with a
slotted spoon (each puff takes about a minute to cook.)

Drain on absorbent paper and pile on to a plate.  Drizzle each layer
with warm honey and sprinkle with cinnamon.  Serve hot.
