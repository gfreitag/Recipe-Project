Title: Chinese Honey Goose
Categories: Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1    Whole goose
MMMMM--------------------HONEY SYRUP MIXTURE-------------------------
3 tb Dark soy sauce
2/3 c  Rice wine or dry sherry
1    Lemon
4 c  Water
3 tb Honey
IF THE GOOSE IS FROZEN, thaw it thoroughly. Rinse the goose well and
blot it completely dry with paper towels. Insert a meat hook near the
neck. Using a sharp knife, cut the lemon into 1/4-inch slices,
leaving the rind on. Combine the lemon slices with the rest of the
honey syrup ingredients in a large pot and bring the mixture to a
boil. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes. Using a
large ladle or spoon, pour this mixture over the goose several times,
as if to bathe it, until all of the skin is completely coated with
the mixture. Hang the goose in a cool, well-ventilated place to dry
for 4-or-5 hours, or hang it in front of a cold fan for about 3
hours--in either case, the longer the better. Once the goose has
dried, the surface of the skin will feel like parchment. Preheat the
oven to 475F. Meanwhile, place the goose on a rack in a roasting pan,
breast side up. Put 2/3 cup of water into the roasting pan. Now put
the goose into the oven and roast it for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to
350F and continue to roast for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Remove the
goose from the oven and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before you
carve it. Using a cleaver or sharp knife, cut the skin and meat into
pieces and arrange them on a warm platter.
