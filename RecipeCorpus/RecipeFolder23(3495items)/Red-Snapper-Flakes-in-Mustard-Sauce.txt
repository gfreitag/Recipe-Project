Spice bag consists of a pinch of thyme and marjoram, 12 peppercorns
and a small bay leaf. In a wide but shallow saucepan bring water,
salt, spice bag and chopped onions, celery and carrots to a boil.
Simmer 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and wine and bring to a boil.
Add the red snapper and boil slowly 5-6 minutes. Remove pan from heat
and let the fish cool in the liquid 1 hour or overnight. When ready
to continue, remove fish and strain liquid reserving 2 cups. Melt the
butter in a 2-quart saucepan, add the flour, stirring well to make a
roux. Mix in the dry mustard. Reheat the 2 cups reserved fish stock
and whisk into the mustard roux. Simmer the sauce, stirring often,
and gradually add the cream. Add the Worcestershire sauce and
continue cooking to reduce the mustard sauce to a velvety
consistency. Flake the red snapper into small pieces, removing any
bones. Add to the mustard sauce, bring to a boil and serve. (Note:
Cheese or spinach souffle and modemade noodles or steamed rice are
suggested accompaniments.)
