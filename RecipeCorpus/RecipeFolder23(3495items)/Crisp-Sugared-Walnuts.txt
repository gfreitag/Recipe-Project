Title: Crisp Sugared Walnuts
Categories: Chinese, Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Peanut or corn oil
4 c  Water
2 c  Walnuts
6 tb Sugar
Traditionally, these crispy sweet walnuts are served as a "starter"
appetizer to a Chinese banquet dinner to tease the palate before the
first entree. They make wonderful snacks or a perfect cocktail food.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Bring a pot of water to a full boil. Add
walnuts, remove from heat and set aside for 3 minutes. Drain walnuts
and pat dry. While nuts are hot, toss evenly with sugar and salt to
coat. Add oil and mix thoroughly. Spread nuts in 1 layer on a
foil-lined baking sheet. Allow the nuts to dry for an hour or until
their surface is thoroughly dry. Bake, stirring occasionally, for 8
to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and serve. Store in an
airtight container. They will keep for several weeks.
