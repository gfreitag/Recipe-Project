Clean squid.  Wash under cold running water and dry thoroughly.
Remove the skin from the snapper (ensure no bones remain) and cut the
meat into tiny pieces.  Crush the garlic.  Beat the egg whites
lightly, add the snapper and garlic and season with salt, white
pepper and nutmeg. Stir to blend thoroughly, then stuff the mixture
into the squid. Chop the shallots, chiles, candlenuts, and lemon
grass, then saute in very hot oil for three to four minutes.  Add the
coconut milk and bring to the boil, then lower heat and add the
stuffed squid. Allow to simmer until the squid is very tender,
approximately one hour, then transfer to a serving dish and pour the
sauce on top.
