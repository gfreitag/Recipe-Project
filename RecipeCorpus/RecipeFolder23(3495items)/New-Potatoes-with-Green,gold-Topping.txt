Title: New Potatoes with Green/gold Topping
Categories: Potato, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
4    Eggs
2 ts To 3 ts Dijonnaise,
- (or 1 part
- mayo mixed with 2 parts
- Dijon mustard)
Salt to taste
6 oz Monterey Jack cheese;
- shredded
8 oz New potatoes; (small,
- tender-skinned)
- Boiling water to cover
2 ts Mayonnaise or slaw dressing
3    Or 4 handfuls of fresh
- spinach leaves; coarse
- stems removed
4    Green onions; sliced
- with tops
Boil potatoes until tender.  Rinse saucepan and return to moderate
heat; add 2 teaspoons mayonnaise or bottled slaw dressing to melt in
pan. Meanwhile, rinse spinach and tear each leaf into three or four
pieces. With a bit of water clinging to the spinach leaves, add to
mayo in saucepan. Cook uncovered, along with the green onions, until
barely wilted. Stir often. Break the eggs over the spinach-onion
mixture and stir slightly to scramble as the eggs set.

To serve, use a fork to break open each hot potato and mash to form a
solid 'bed' on each plate.  Salt potato layer lightly and dot with
Dijonnaise; spread to distribute evenly. Sprinkle with a little
shredded Monterey Jack. Top with scrambled spinach-egg-onion mixture
in an even layer. Salt lightly, if desired. Sprinkle remaining
shredded cheese on top. Serve hot.

NUTRITION ANALYSIS: 1 serving has 638 calories, 31.4 g fat, 508 mg
cholesterol. To reduce fat and cholesterol, use egg substitute
instead of whole eggs; buy a skim-milk mozzarella instead of Monterey
Jack cheese, and use less in the topping. If sodium is a concern,
this is still tasty without any table salt.
