large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat until it sizzles.  Brown
the chicken on all sides.  Drain on a paper towel. Transfer the
chicken to the Dutch oven with the onions.  Add the peppers and cook

tender; about 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and heavy
cream. With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a heated
platter.  Whisk a little of the hot sauce into the sour cream
mixture, then add the mixture to the sauce in the Dutch oven.  Reduce
over high heat until slightly thickened.  Serve the chicken with the
sauce spooned over it, sprinkled with a little paprika and parsley.
