Title: Vegetable Soup with Goulash Taste
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 5 servings
2    Meat extract cubes; should
-be enough to make 1/2 litre
-meat broth, but do NOT use
-meat broth!
Salt
White pepper
Basil; *
6 dl Water
150 g  Yellow onion; chopped
150 g  Turnip; cut in small cubes
200 g  Squash; cut in small cubes
200 g  Carrot; shredded
50 g  Tomato; cut in small pieces
4 dl Tomato juice
2 dl Water
* Use wathever you like from spices and herbs. I usually add some
"taco table spicemix", some oregano and some black pepper.

Bring the water to a boil together with the meat extract cubes. Add
vegetables and tomato juice. Add more water, put the water into the
tomato juice packet and shake so you get all of the juice out of it.
Let simmer until everything get really mixed and you can't really see
what is what. Mix a little water with flour, add, stir well and let
boil for a couple of minutes.

These are pretty large servings, and noone has to be hungry after
eating... You can replace almost all the vegetables with something
else, it should be a total of about 800 g vegetables, that's the main
"rule" in this recipe...

If you are a Weight Watcher one portion will take about 10 extra
calories from your weekly amount of extra calories , NOTHING ELSE...
guess if I love this recipe!
