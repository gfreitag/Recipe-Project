Title: Corn and Marigold Fritters
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
Sea salt
White pepper
1 tb Marigold petals *
1 tb Sunflower oil, or more
8 oz Sweetcorn kernals
4 tb Double (heavy) cream
1 tb Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder (or soda)
*NOTE: Make certain that you use a pot marigold (Calendula) rather
than an African marigold (Tagetes).

This is an excellent supper dish, which children will enjoy.  Serve
the fritters with a hot green vegetable or salad and brown bread and
butter.

Put the sweetcorn in a bowl and pour over the cream.  Sift in the
flour and baking powder (soda) and season to taste.  Stir in the
marigold petals.

Set a large, heavy frying pan over high heat and pour in the oil.
Drop spoonfuls of the fritter mixture into the oil and fry until
golden on both sides, turning once.  Press the mixture flat with a
spatula to give a lacy effect at the edges.

Cook the fritters in bunches until all the mixture is used up, adding
more oil to the pan if necessary.  Serve hot.
