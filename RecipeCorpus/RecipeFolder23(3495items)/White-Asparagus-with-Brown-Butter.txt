Title: White Asparagus with Brown Butter
Categories: Vegetable, German
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
2/3 c  Fine,soft white bread crumbs
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
3 lb White asparagus
2 qt Boiling water mixed with
4 ts Salt
SNAP OFF THE WOODY ENDS of the asparagus and discard them or save
them to make soup. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the asparagus
spears. Lay them flat in a large skillet, pour in the boiling salted
water, set the pan over moderate heat, cover it, and cook the
asparagus for about 5 minutes, just until they are tender, but still
crisp. Meanwhile, lightly brown the butter in a medium skillet over
moderate heat. Add the bread crumbs and pepper and lightly toss them
to mix. Reduce the heat under the skillet to low, to keep the crumbs
warm. The instant the asparagus are done, drain them well, then
return them to the skillet and shake them over moderate heat for 30
seconds or so to dry up any excess moisture. Transfer the asparagus
to a small heated platter, then artfully arrange the crumb mixture on
top.
