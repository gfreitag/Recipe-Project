~-- Cover chiles with water.  Let stand until softened, about 1 hour.
Drain and finely chop.  Place pork chops in a shallow glass or
plastic dish. Place chiles and remaining ingredients, except the
orange, in a blender container.  Cover and blend, at low speed, until
smooth.  Pour over chops. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours,
spooning marinade over chops occasionally.  Set oven control to
broil.  Remove chops from marinade and sit marinade aside.  Place
chops on rack in a broiler pan.  Broil, with tops of the chops 3 to 5
inches from the heat, until light brown, about 10 minutes.  Turn the
chops and brush with the marinade.  Broil until chops are done, about
5 minutes longer.  Garnish with orange wedges and serve.
