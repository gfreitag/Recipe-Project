Sift flour, salt and sugar into mixing bowl.  Cut in butter with 2
knives, then rub with fingertips until mixture resembles fine crumbs.
Beat egg yolk with lemon juice and cold water and blend in, using
knife.  When dough clings together knead lightly until smooth, cover
and rest for 30 minutes.

Beat cheese until smooth, gradually beat in honey and sugar.  Beat in
eggs, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.

Roll out pastry on a lightly floured board to a 30 cm (12 inch)

with the pastry. Lightly beat egg white and brush some of this over
pastry.  Pour cheese mixture into pastry case and smooth top.

Bake in a hot oven for 15 minutes, reduce to moderately slow and bake

slightly. Leave pie in oven until cool.  Dust with remaining cinnamon
and serve cut in wedges or in traditional diamond-shaped pieces.

Note:  Store honey pie in covered container in refrigerator.  Bring
