Title: Moustokouloura (Wine Must Cookies)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Greek, Dessert
Yield: 24 servings
1/2 c  Petimezi
-(Greek wine must syrup)
-OR- Italian vino cotto
-OR- Honey
1/2    Orange; (grated zest)
1 c  Orange juice
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
-plus extra for kneading
2 ts Baking soda
1 tb Freshly ground cinnamon
1 tb Freshly ground cloves
1/4 c  Mild olive oil
2 tb Honey
Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves into a
large bowl, making a well in the center.  In a smaller bowl, beat the
olive oil with the honey, petimezi, grated orange zest, and 1/2 the
orange juice and pour into the well.  Mix together to make a dough,
adding the remaining orange juice as necessary.

Turn onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until the
dough is smooth but not stiff.  Cover with a cloth and leave to relax
for 30 minutes or longer.

Break off pieces of dough, about 2 tablespoonfuls each, and roll into
snakes about 1/2-inch in diameter.  Press the two ends together,
forming oval wreaths, and place on an oiled or non-stick baking
sheet.  Bake in an oven preheated to 375 F for 10-15 minutes- until
they are brown and crunchy, but not too hard.
