RE: Crock pot recipes

DC>I am not the most creative person in the world when it comes to
using my crock pot.  Do any of you have favorite recipes you could
post for me?

Here are a couple of things that I make in mine.  I don't have exact
measurements though, because these are just things I thought up
myself.

Brown italian sausage (I usually get about two pounds) in skillet or
put under

broiler just till browned.  Drain off fat and let cool just till you
can handle them. Meanwhile they are browning, cup up a whole bunch of
onions and peppers, and if you want, add a clove of garlic. Place
vegees in crockpot. Then cut up sausage in very small pieces. Add to
crockpot. Cover with an eight-ounce can tomato sauce and add oregano,
basil or whatever. Sook about six or seven hours. Serve in sub rolls
or on hamburger burns or over rice.

2 Barbecued Beef

Get a very small pot roast.  Season and put in crockpot.  Cover with
barbecue

sauce.  Add more sauce near the end because the sauce will lose its
flavor during cooking, or add new sauce after slicing. Remove roast
from crockpot after cooking, and slice into thin slices. (maybe
slices isn't the right word,

it kind of shreds.)  Anyway, serve in hamburger buns.  Good with baked
beans and salad.
