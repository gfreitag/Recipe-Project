Title: Catfish in Red Curry Sauce
Categories: Fish, Main dish, Indian, Stove top, Curries
Yield: 1 servings
3 T  Fish sauce
2 lb Dressed catfish cut in
-steaks
1 T  Substitute Italian basil
1    3 fresh hot chilies chopped
2 T  Red curry paste
4 T  Peanut oil
2 c  Coconut milk
1/2 t  Salt
1 t  Sugar
Heat the curry paste in oil, stirring for about 2 minutes over med
heat. Add 1/4 cup of coconut milk and the fish sauce and simmer
slowly for another 2 minutes. Add the salt, sugar and the rest of the
coconut milk. Bring to a boil and, as soon as the sauce boils, add
the fish. DO NOT STIR THE FISH UNTIL THE SAUCE RETURNS TO A BOIL.
Chai says that if you disturb the fish before the sauce boils it will
acquire a strong aroma. Simmer the fish until done, about 5 minutes.
Let the dish sit for at least 15 minutes (or even as long as
overnight in the refrigerator) so the curry flavor permeates the
fish. Reheat, without boiling, and just before serving add the basil
leaves and chilies. Serve over rice.
