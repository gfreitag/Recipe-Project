* Prepare ahead of time!!! Let cool completely! While toppping is
cooling, prepare pasta and meat filling.

Cook pasta tender but firm. Do NOT overcook!

Brown the meat with the chopped onions and garlic.  Add the spices,
sugar to taste, and the drained tomatoes.  Let the sauce simmer 30-45
min. Mix in the cooked pasta and put in a baking pan.

To make the topping, melt the butter (or margarine) in a saucepan
and mix in the flour to form a paste.  Add the milk and heat at
medium stirring constantly until mixture thickens.  When thick, add
parmesan and crumbled feta cheese and stir until melted.  A few
tablespoons of parmesan and about 6 ounces of feta.

LET THIS MIXTURE COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE ADDING THE BEATEN EGGS!!!
After the eggs are stirred in, pour this mixture over the meat and
pasta. Bake about 45 min or until brown.

This dish is a bit like moussaka because of the topping.

NOTE: 6/12/93 - Made this dish with Montery Jack cheese instead of
feta. Used 1 to 1 1/2 cup tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes and
2 eggs. Came out Delicious!!! - Set oven for 350-375F and cook a full
40 minutes.
