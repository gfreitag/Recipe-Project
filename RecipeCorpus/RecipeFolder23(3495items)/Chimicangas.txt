Title: Chimicangas
Categories: Ground beef, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Enchilada sauce (canned is
-fine)
1 lb Ground beef
1 md Sized chopped onion
first, make the meat filling Brown the meat and drain. Add the onion,
cook until soft.  Add the

sauce and let simmer for 10 minutes Now you're ready to really start.
12 flour tortillas(7 inches in diameter) 2 1/4 cups of meat
filling(from above) 1 1/2 to 2 cups each of shredded cheddar cheese,
shredded lettuce, and chopped green onions or radishes Sour cream

Spoon 3 tablespoons of the filling down the center of tortilla.

Fold tortilla around filling, and fasten with wooden toothpicks.
Assemble only 2 or 3 at a time, or the tortilla will absorb liquid
from the filling. Fry in 1 inch of hot oul over medium heat
(350degrees), turning,

until golden; takes 1 to 2 minutes.  Lift from fat with a slotted
spoon, draining, then place on a thick layer of paper towels; keep in
a warm place until all are cooked. Serve garnished with 2 or 3
tablespoons each shredded cheese, lettuce,

and radishes or green onions, and add sour cream to taste. Do not
forget to remove the toothpicks before serving.  I've done

it once, and it is extremely painful. These aren't quite like the
ones you get in restaurants, because

they use huge platter-sized tortillas.  They are still a grease
maniac's dream--very greasy, very tasty.  You can use animal fat or
lard to fry up the chimichangas, I believe, but I would suggest using
vegetable oil. It works just fine, and the other way will probably
cause a cholesterol overload.  Otherwise, it's fantastic.
