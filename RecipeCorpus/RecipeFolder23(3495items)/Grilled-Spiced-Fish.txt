1/2 ts Chile powder
1 tb Lemon juice
Lemon wedges for garnish
4 oz Sole, skinned
Salt and pepper to taste

Rinse fish, pat dry with paper towels and place in a shallow non-metal
dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Mix together yogurt, coriander, chile powder, garlic, and lemon
juice. Pour over fish. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours to allow
fish to absorb flavors.

and turning over halfway through cooking. Serve hot, garnished with
lemon wedges.
