-sliced
Combine vinegar, oil, salt and pepper in a large bowl, adjust
seasoning. Julienne the chilled angler and toss in the dressing with
peppers, capers and scallions.  Serve over lettuce leaves. Serves 4.
I like to use red, yellow and orange bell peppers, which go nicely
with the white fish and the greens of the lettuce, scallions and
capers. I use a white wine vinegar, sometimes one flavored tarragon
or other
