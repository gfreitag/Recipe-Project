Title: Pickled Cabbage
Categories: Can/preserv
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Salt
1 lg Cabbage
"Cabbage is a frequent constituent of pickles, but this is the first
time we have had it pickled alone.  This make a very sharp pickle -
almost a condiment that might be used in place of horseradish. It is
very good in an oyster cocktail sauce and may be used sparingly as a
relish for meats."

White wine vinegar Cloves, mace and allspice

Slice or shred the cabbage very fine.  Put it into an earthen dish and
sprinkle with the salt, mixing it in well.  Cover with another dish
and let it stand for twenty-four hours.

Drain the cabbage and take enough vinegar to cover it.  Add, for each
pint, four whole cloves, two blades of mace and four whole allspice.
Boil the vinegar for two minutes and pour over the cabbage.  Seal in
pint jars. This amount makes about three pints.

The directions for sealing are to "cover it close with a cloth.  Then
tie it over with leather," but we find that the glass jar method is
-Bossis
more satisfactory.
