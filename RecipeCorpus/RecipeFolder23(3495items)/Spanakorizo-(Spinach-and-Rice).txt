Karen Mintzias
2 tb Clarified butter or oil
1 sm Onion; chopped
1/2 c  Raw long-grain white rice
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
1/4 c  Water (or more)
2 lb Fresh spinach;washed,trimmed
Heat the butter or oil in an enameled pan, then add the onions and
cook until soft and transparent.  Add the rice and saute for a few
minutes, stirring constantly, then add the tomato sauce (or same
amount of canned chopped tomatoes, drained) and water, cover the pan
and simmer until the rice is almost tender (approximately 10
minutes).  Uncover and stir in the spinach, parsley, mint; season
with salt and pepper.  Partially cover the pan and continue cooking,
stirring with a wooden spoon until the spinach has wilted.  Grate a
little nutmeg over the top and continue cooking until all the liquid
has been absorbed and the spanakorizo is tender, not mushy. Remove
from the heat and drape with a dry towel until ready to use. Transfer
to a warm serving dish, and garnish with the sliced eggs and lemon
wedges.  Serve warm.

Note: To make Prassorizo (Leek Rice), substitute 1 1/2 pounds sliced
leeks for the spinach and add with the liquid.  Leeks need longer
cooking time.
