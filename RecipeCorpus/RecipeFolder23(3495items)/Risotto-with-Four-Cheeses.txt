Title: Risotto with Four Cheeses
Categories: Italian, Cheese/eggs, Rice
Yield: 4 servings
5 tb Butter
2 c  Arborio rice (15 ounces)
3 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
3 tb Grated pecorino cheese
1 ts Ground black pepper
1 md Onion
4 oz Fontina cheese
5 oz Gorganzola cheese
6 c  Chicken stock (OR 3 cups
-canned chicken broth and
3 c  Water)
Peel and mince the onion.  Cut the fontina and Gorganzola cheeses into
1/4-inch dice (1 cup each).  Bring the chicken stock (or chicken
broth and water) to a boil; cover and keep warm.  Heat 4 tablespoons
butter in a large soup kettle.  Add the onions and saute until
softened, about 4 minutes.  Stir in rice and saute until translucent
and coated with butter, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup hot stock and,
stirring continuously, simmer until liquid is completely absorbed,
about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining stock, stirring continuously,
adding 1/2 cup at a time. Add more stock only after previous addition
has been absorbed. Continue to cook, stirring and adding hot stock,
until rice is creamy and just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from
heat and stir in remaining butter, cheeses, and pepper. Serve
immediately.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.

BASIC RISOTTO:  Use the same recipe except increase the butter to 1/4
pound, increase the Parmesan cheese to 6 tablespoons and omit the
other three cheeses
