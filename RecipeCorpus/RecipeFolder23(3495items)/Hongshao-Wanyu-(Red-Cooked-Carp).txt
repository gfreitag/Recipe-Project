-bean sauce)
2 tb Dark soy sauce
1 tb Sugar
6 tb Chicken stock or water
1/2 oz Dried Tangerine Peel, or:

3 lb Firm, white-fleshed Fish

SOAK THE TANGERINE or citrus peel for 20 minutes in warm water or
until it is soft. Rinse under running water, squeeze out any excess
liquid, finely chop and set aside. Make 3 or 4 slashes on each side
of the fish to help it cook faster and allow the flavors to permeate.
Rub the fish on both sides with the salt. Sprinkle the cornstarch
evenly on each side of the fish. Heat a wok or deep saute pan until
it is hot. Add the oil. When hot, deep-fry the fish on each side for
5 to 8 minutes until brown and crispy. Remove fish and drain on paper
towels. Pour off oil, leaving 2 tablespoons. Reheat the wok. Add
chopped tangerine peel, garlic, ginger and scallions and stir-fry for
30 seconds. Put in the rest of the ingredients. Return the fish to
the wok, spooning the ingredients over the top of the fish. Cover
wok. Cook over low heat for 8 minutes. Serve at once. Serves 4, as
part of a Chinese meal or 2, as a single dish.
