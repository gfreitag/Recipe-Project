1 qt Vinegar
1 qt Water
4 ts Salt
2 1/2 lb Red or green sweet peppers
-or:
2 1/2 lb Fresh hot chilies
olive oil (optional)

Wash the peppers or chilies thoroughly.  Cut around the stem of each
large pepper and pull out the stem with attached core and seeds.
Leave the peppers whole of cut them into sections or strips, as
desired. Hot chilies may be stemmed and seeded, of left whole with
stems intact. Make two small slits in whole peppers or chilies.

Mix the vinegar and water; heat to a simmer - 150 F to 160F. The
vinegar should NOT be allowed to boil.  Add the salt

Pack the peppers of chilies rather tightly into jars.  Pour the hot
vinegar mixture over the peppers to within 1/2 inch of the jar rims.
Or, if you wish to add olive oil, pour the vinegar to within 3/4 inch
of the rim and pour oil to within 1/2 inch of the rims. The peppers
or chilies will be coated with oil when they pass through the oil
layer as you use them.

Cover jars and process for 15 minutes in a boiling water bath.
