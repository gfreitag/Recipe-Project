Most of us tend to think of olives as a salty-fatty food.  But it's
possible to buy low salt black olives, featured in the Mediterranean
style sauce, that have all the good flavor without all of the salt.
Yes, the capers that lend spark to the sauce are themselves salty;
but you can cut down on their saltiness by choosing a brand that
ranks salt further down, and thus in lesser concentration-on the
ingredients list,and then draining and rinsing the capers well before
adding them.  Serve with medium to large strands, ribbons, or shapes.

broken by hand or chopped into about 4 pieces each 3 tbsp capers,
drained and rinsed 1 tbsp balsamic or good quality red wine vinegar 1
tbsp double concentrate tomato paste 2 tsp sugar 1/2 tbsp dried
oregano

In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil with the garlic and
onion over moderate heat.  When they sizzle, add the tomatoes,
breaking them up with your hands.  Then stir in the remaining
ingredients. Simmer the sauce until it is thick but still slightly
liquid, 5-7 minutes.  Serve over cooked pasta. Serves 4.
