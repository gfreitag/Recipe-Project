Title: Dr. Oetker's Rouladen
Categories: Beef, German
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Onion; diced
1 tb Lemon juice
8 tb Oil
Sour cream; (optional)
1 c  ;Water, boiling
Creme fraiche; (optional)
8    Beef, thin slices
1 ts Cornstarch
Mustard, prepared
1 ts Paprika
4 oz Bacon, uncooked; diced
1 c  Tomato puree
Cut thin slices of roasting beef to around 4 x 6 inches off a roast.
It is best to cut the meat WITH the grain of the meat, so the slices
will hold together. Pound the slices lightly to flatten and tenderize
them. Brush lightly with prepared mustard. Then sprinkle the slices
with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  In a small bowl
mix together the diced bacon and diced onions.  Spread the mixture on
the meat slices. Then, starting at the narrow end, roll up the meat
slices and secure them with skewers, toothpicks, or string.

Heat the oil in a heavy pot.  Brown the rolls well in the oil.  Add
about 1 cup of boiling water to the pot VERY CAREFULLY! Cover the
meat and braise gently until done, about 2 to 2-1/2 hours.  Add water
as needed to keep level fairly constant.  When the meat is cooked,
remove the rolls to a hot plate and thicken the gravy with corn
starch and season to taste. The sauce may be seasoned with paprika,
tomato puree, lemon juice, sour cream, and/or creme fraiche.

Serve this with a potato or pasta dish.
