Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
-Olive oil
2 T  Orange marmalade
1 t  Minced garlic
-Salt
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/4 c  Olive oil or hazelnut oil
4    Swordfish fillets
-Freshly ground black pepper
1 t  Minced fresh ginger root
1/2 t  Ground white pepper
1/4 c  White-wine vinegar
1/4 c  Fresh orange juice

Brush swordfish with olive oil and a few grinds of black pepper.
Refrigerate until ready to use. In a non-reactive sauce pan, combine
marmalade, ginger, garlic, white pepper, salt to taste, vinegar, lemon
juice, and orange juice. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced to
1/2 cup. Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Whisk in 1/2 cup olive
oil. Store in refrigerator until ready to use. Prepare the grill.
Warm the marinade slightly.  Brush the fish fillets lightly with
marinade.  Grill on oiled rack over hot coals until fish feels
springy to the touch.  If the fillets are less than 1/2 inch thick,
grill only on one side.  Place grilled fish on warm plates and serve
with an assortment of mixed greens. Pass remaining orange sauce.

Serves four.

NOTE:  The orange marinade is also good brushed on steaks, ribs, or
pork chops before grilling or barbecuing.
