Categories: Appetizer, Seafood
Yield: 24 servings
1/2 ts Grated gingerroot or 1/4 tsp
-ground ginger
4 oz Can tiny shrimp, drained
6    Sheets frozen phyllo dough
-(16 x 12 inches), thawed
1/2 c  Margarine or butter, melted
1/3 c  Plain yogurt
1/4 c  Coconut
1/4 c  Finely chopped unsalted
-peanuts
2 tb Chopped chutney
1 ts Curry powder
Filling: In a small mixing bowl stir together yogurt, cocnut, peanuts,
chutney, curry powder, and gingerroot or ginger.  Gently stir in
shrimp.

Unfold phyllo dough.  Place one sheet of phyllo dough on a
waxed-paper-lined cutting board.  Cover remaining sheets with a damp
paper towel or cloth.  Keep covered to prevent drying.  Generously
brush with some of the margarine or butter.  Top with another sheet
of phyllo, then brush with more of the margarine or butter.  Repeat
with a third sheet of phyllo and margarine or butter.

Using a sharp knife, cut the stack of buttered phyllo sheets into
twelve 4-inch squares.  Place about 2 teaspoons of the filling in the
center of each square.  For each bundle, bring the 4 corners
together; 1 pinch and twist slightly.

Repeat with the remaining phyllo dough, margarine or butter, and
filling to make 24 bundles total.  Arrange bundles on an ungreased
parchment- or foil-lined baking sheet.

Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F oven for 18 to 20 minutes or till
golden.  Serve immediately.  Makes 24 bundles.

To freeze: Prepare phyllo bundles as directed, except do not bake.
Freeze the unbaked bundles on a baking sheet. Transfer to a storage
container; seal, label, and place in the freezer.  To serve, place
frozen bundles on a parchment- or foil-lined baking sheet.  Bake,
uncovered, in a 375 degree F oven for 18 to 20 minutes or till golden.
