Categories: Greek, Dessert
Yield: 30 servings

1 c  Chopped unsalted pistachios
4 1/2 tb Granulated sugar
1 tb Ground cinnamon
Confectioners' sugar
Karen Mintzias
1/4 lb Sweet butter
1 1/4 c  Fine semolina
Orange flower water
1/4 ts Salt
In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the butter to bubbling over medium
heat and stir in the fine semolina.  Transfer to a small bowl, cover,
and let stand overnight at room temperature.  The next day, uncover
and add 2 teaspoons orange flower water, the salt, and gradually the
warm water, working with your fingers to make a firm dough.  Knead
for 5 minutes, then cover and let rest 1 hour.  Meanwhile, combine
the pistachios, sugar, and ground cinnamon in a small bowl.

Break off pieces of dough slightly larger in size than a walnut.
Work in your fingers to form a ball.  Press the center with your
thumb to make a large well and fill with 1 teaspoon of the nut
mixture, then cover over with dough and shape into an oval. Set on a
cookie sheet and continue until all pastries are shaped.  Bake in a
moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 35 minutes or until the yellow color
has become a light, not a deep, chestnut. Remove to racks and cool
for 10 minutes, then dip quickly into orange flower water and roll in
confectioners' sugar.  Cool before storing.

Note: You may substitute blanched almonds for the pistachios and
peanut oil for the butter.
