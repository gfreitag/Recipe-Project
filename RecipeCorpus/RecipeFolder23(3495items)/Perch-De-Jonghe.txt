-salt
1/2 lb Perch fillets
2 T  Butter
-dash
1 T  Fresh Italian parsley,
-minced  2 tbs  dry sherry
-White pepper
Melt the butter in a medium skillet.  Saute the garlic over low heat
until tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove pan from heat.  Stir in salt,
chives, Italian parsley, and sherry.  Season to taste with white
pepper. Arrange the perch fillets in a buttered shallow baking pan.
Pour the butter mixture over the fish.  Sprinkle bread crumbs over
the top. Bake at 375F until bread crumbs are golden and fish is
cooked through, about 10 minutes. Crusty French or Italian bread is
essential for soaking up the juices.

NOTE:  The original Chicago recipe was for Shrimp de Jonghe.  To make
the original, substitute 1/2 lb of good-quality, alrge, raw shrimp
for the perch in the above recipe.  A slightly fatty, full-flavored
fish such as catfish would also be an excellent substitute.  Scallop
lovers can try sea scallops.   < I'll settle for the shrimp; fp >
