-crusts remove, cut in

"I have never found out the origin  of this recipe or where its name
comes from. However, it is particularly pleasant because of the
contrast between the hot toasted bread (which is similar to the
French toast) and the cold raspberries and cream."

Sprinkle the raspberries with confectioner's sugar, crush them gently
with a fork and set aside. Whip the cream until it is stiff. Place
the sherry in one bowl and the lightly beaten egg yolks in another.
Dip the bread slices first in the sherry and then in the egg yolks.
Melt the butter in a frying pan and when it is hot, fry the bread on
both sides until it is golden brown. Transfer the slices to a warm
dish and sprinkle each side with a little cinnamon. Place a few of
the raspberries on each slice of the toasted bread and cover with a
dollop of cream. SERVES: 4-6
