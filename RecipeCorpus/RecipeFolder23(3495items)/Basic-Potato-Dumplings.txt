Title: Basic Potato Dumplings
Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 8 servings
- 2-1/2 Cups
1 tb Vegetable Oil
1/4 c  Butter
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
8 md Potatoes
1    Egg Yolk
1 tb Salt
2 c  All-Purpose Flour, Up To
Puncture potatoes in several places with a fork.  Bake 1 hour in a
350F oven or until tender.  Remove and discard skins.  Mash potatoes
through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl, and let cool a
little.  Add egg yolk, salt, and 2 cups flour.  Mix well.  Knead
dough on work surface or board into a ball.  It should be soft and a
little sticky.  If it's too sticky, add a little flour.  Lightly
flour surface and hands.  Break dough into egg-size pieces.  Roll
until thickness of thumb.  Cut roll into 1-inch pieces.  Push each
Gnocchi against the back of a fork to imprint a pattern. This helps
them absorb more sauce (and makes them a little prettier). Arrange
them on a floured tray.  Fill a large saucepan 2/3 full with salted
water.  Bring to a boil.  Add oil and dumplings. Stir, to make sure
they don't stick t bottom.  When they come to surface, let them cook
10-12 seconds more.  Remove with a slotted spoon as they are done.
They get soggy if overcooked (they absorb more moisture than regular
pasta). Serve with butter and Parmesan cheese or your favorite sauce.
