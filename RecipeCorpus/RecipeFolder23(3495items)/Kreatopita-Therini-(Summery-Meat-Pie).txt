Title: Kreatopita Therini (Summery Meat Pie)
Categories: Greek, Meat, Main dish
Yield: 10 servings
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1/2 ts Ground coriander or allspice
1 ts Dried oregano
1 c  Grated cheese (Mizithra!!!)
Bread crumbs, if necessary
10    Commercial filo sheets
6 tb Butter; melted
Karen Mintzias
4    Scallions; chopped
3 tb Butter or oil
1 lb Veal, beef or lamb (ground)
4 sm Zucchini; scrubbed, cubed
1 sm Eggplant; cubed
1 c  Canned tomatoes; drained
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
Saute the scallions in the 3 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan
and add the meat. Simmer a few minutes, then toss in the zucchini,
eggplant, tomatoes, and parsley and season with salt and pepper.
Cover the pan and simmer for 30 minutes, adding the coriander and
oregano during the last 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in
the cheese. (The mixture should be thick; if any liquid remains, dust
lightly with bread crumbs to absorb.) Line a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking
pan with 6 filo sheets, buttering each. Spread the filling over the
filo evenly, then top with the remaining filo sheets, buttering each
as before. Score the top few filo sheets into squares or diamonds.
Bake in a medium oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden in color and
the dough is crisp. Remove from the oven, and let stand for 10
minutes, then cut and serve warm.
