Title: Wespennester - Wefzgeneschter (Wasp Nests)
Categories: Dessert, German
Yield: 8 servings
1 ds Salt
10 tb Liquid honey
Fat for frying
1    Egg, separated
2 tb Milk
50 g  Flour (1/2 cup less 1 Tbsp)
From grandmother's more thrifty times; rarely encountered today.

From the Oberallgaeu region.

Make a batter of the flour, egg yolk, milk, salt, and sugar. Beat the
egg whites, and add to the mixture.  Take five wooden spoons and
stick the handles about 1/3 to 3/4 inch deep into the dough, twisting
the handles as you do so.  Immediately transfer them to fat that has
been heated to 390 degrees F.  As soon as the dough has browned, once
again dip into the dough, then back into the hot fat.  Repeat the
process 5 to 6 times.  When the very outside layer has turned crisp
and brown, remove the pastry from the spoon handle, fill with honey,
and serve hot, dusted with crushed sugar.

Makes 8 wasp nests, for dessert.
