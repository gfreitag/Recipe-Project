Heat the oil in a large skillet and fry the peppers lightly and

the garlic, tomatoes and artichokes over low heat. Add the rice and
stir, then add the saffron and paprika. Add the water and salt to

vigorously. Puree the fried peppers with a little water and add to

should be cooked, dry and have the grains separate (rather than stuck
together).
