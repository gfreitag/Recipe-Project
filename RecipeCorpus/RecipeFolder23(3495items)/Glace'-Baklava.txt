Karen Mintzias
4    Eggs
1 lb Blanched almonds
- finely chopped
1 1/2 c  Sugar
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
1/2    Lemon (juice only)
1    Cinnamon stick
3 c  Sugar
2 c  Water
Beat eggs until light.  Fold in almonds and sugar.  Stir in fruit.
Take 2 sheets of phyllo pastry, brush one at a time with melted
butter, and place one on top of the other.  On the long end of the
phyllo sheet spread some of the fruit-and-nut mixture in a band about
1 inch wide.  Fold in ends and roll like a jelly-roll.  Place on a
cooky sheet and brush top with melted butter.  Make diagonal slits
along the whole length, about 1 1/2 inches apart, being careful not
to cut all the way through.  Continue making the rolls until all nut
mixture is used.  Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for about 1 1/2
hours or until golden brown.  Cut pieces through entire roll. Dip hot
baklava pieces in cold syrup and drain well.

Syrup: In a saucepan, combine all ingredients.  Bring to a boil and
boil for 20 minutes.  Cool.
