- heads left on
2 tb Olive oil (or more)
1    Lemon (juice only)
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley

Wash and dry the fish.  In a glass or earthenware bowl, beat the oil,
lemon juice, parsley, thyme, fennel, and a pinch each of salt and
pepper. Dip each fish in the mixture, turning to coat and allow to

Remove the fish from marinade and drain.  Meanwhile, beat the
anchovies and butter together and spread on the fish with a knife.
Wrap each fish in grapevine leaves and place, seam side down, in an
attractive baking- serving dish.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for
30 minutes.  Serve hot, garnished with lemon and fennel.
