~-- Heat the oil in a very large skillet. Stir in the onion, garlic
and chile pepper. Saute over medium high heat until the onion is just
tender, about 5 minutes. Add the cubed and ground venison and
continue cooking for about 4-5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon,
until the ground meat is no longer red. Add all the remaining
ingredients except the beans and masa harina. Bring the mixture to a
boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook uncovered for 30
minutes, stirring occasionally. The stew should be fairly thick. Stir
in the kidney beans and the masa harina and heat through. Taste and
adjust the seasonings.
