Speculaas are a traditional Dutch biscuit or cookie baked on St.
Nicholas' Eve (Dec. 5).

PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Mix all ingredients but the almonds and candied
fruit peel together. Add milk until it makes a stiff paste that can
be rolled out. Roll into sheets and then press blanched almonds and
chopped candied peel on top, if you desire. Cut into rectangles
roughly 2-by-4-inches and transfer to a greased cooking sheet. Bake
until light brown.
