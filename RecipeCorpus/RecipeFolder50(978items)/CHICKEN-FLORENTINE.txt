Title: CHICKEN FLORENTINE
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Boned breasts of chicken
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 pn Nutmeg
1/2 lb Fresh spinach; washed and
- chopped coarsely, -=OR=-
1/2 pk -Frozen Spinach, defrosted
- squeezed of all water
6 sl Boiled ham (thin slices)
6 sl Fontina cheese (thin slices)
2    Eggs
1 1/2 tb Whipping cream
1/2 tb Chopped parsley
1/3 c  Parmesan cheese
1/2 c  Flour
2/3 c  Vegetable oil
8 tb Butter
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Brown sauce
1    Lemon; juice only
SKIN BREASTS (skins may be used later for stock); trim off all
gristle and fat. Cut breasts in half and butterfly each half (slice
each half lengthwise, leaving 1 side uncut). Place on waxed paper and
gently flatten with a meat mallet until pieces are quite thin. Season
with salt and pepper and nutmeg. Steam fresh spinach in 3/4 cup
salted water for 3 minutes and drain well. If using frozen spinach,
simply drain well when completely defrosted. Place equal amounts of
spinach in center of each half of chicken, cover with a slice of ham
and press down edges of chicken together, then seal edges with a meat
mallet. Beat eggs in a mixing bowl, add cream, parsley and Parmesan
cheese, and blend well. Dust chicken lightly with flour and dip in
egg batter, 1 piece at a time, making sure to coat heavily. Heat oil
in a skillet until very hot, and saute each piece separately until
crisp and golden in color. Trim edges of any excess egg batter and
transfer chicken to a warm platter. Melt butter in frying pan large
enough to accommodate all the chicken. Add wine and cook until it
evaporates--about 5-or-6 minutes. Add brown sauce, cook 5 minutes.
Then place chicken in pan, cook 5 minutes. Add lemon juice and cook
additional 3 minutes. Turn once. Cook another 5 minutes. Place
chicken breasts on serving platter, pour hot sauce over and serve.
