Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Chicken Breast Halves
Without Skin -- boned
1/2 ts Cumin
Salt And Pepper -- to taste
8 oz Tortilla Chips -- Lightly
Salted
28 oz Green Enchilada Sauce
8 oz Monterey Jack Cheese --
Shredded
1/2 c  Cilantro -- chopped
4    Green Onions -- chopped
8 tb Light Sour Cream -- or real
Sour cream
1/2 c  Salsa Fresca -- fresh or
Storebought
Sprinkle breasts with cumin, salt and pepper.  Broil until just done.
I do this in a toaster oven for about 5 minutes per side. Slice or
shred chicken. Evenly cover four microwave safe dinner plates with
tortilla chips. Sprinkle with chicken. Pour enchilada sauce over the
chicken and then microwave each plate for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes. Top
with cheese and microwave each plate for 45-60 seconds or until
cheese melts in the center of plate. Meanwhile, chop and combine
cilantro and green onions. Spinkle a 1/4 cup mixture over each of the
heated plates. Put a dollop of sour cream in the center of each plate
and surround with salsa fresca.
