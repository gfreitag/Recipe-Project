Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Chicken fryer, cut into
1 x  Portion-sized pieces
1 ea Garlic clove, minced
2 c  Coconut milk
1 ea Sprig fresh parsley
1 ts Dried thyme
1 x  Or 1 sprig fresh
1/4 c  Coconut oil
1 ea Onion, finely chopped
1/4 lb Mushrooms, sliced
1 x  Salt and pepper
1 ea Small fresh hot pepper
Towel dry the chicken.  In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil. Add
chicken pieces and fry until lightly browned. Remove from the skillet
a aside.  in the same skillet, saute the onion, garlic, and mushrooms
for 3 minutes.  Return the chicken to the skillet and add the coconut
milk a and pepper to taste.  Tie the parsley, hot pepper, and thyme
in a cheese pouch to form a bouquet garni, and add to the skillet.
Cover and simmer the chicken is tender, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove the
bouquet garni and the chicken with rice. My own notes: Just tried
this recipe out making a few additions. When the browned chicken back
into the skillet with the coconut milk, etc., I added 3 riped
plantains, sliced, a few Caribbean root vegetables (e.g. y diced
small, a little brown sugar, 2 packets of Sazon spice mix, curry p
and 2 or 3 tablespoons of rum. The plantains pretty much melted into
th but the root vegetables held their shape. All in all the sauce was
swee which I wanted it to be) and delicious over the rice.
