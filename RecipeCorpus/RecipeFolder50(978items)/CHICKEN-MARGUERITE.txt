Categories: Cyberealm, Mom's best, Poultry, Ww
Yield: 8 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Minced garlic
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Black pepper
1    3 lb chicken, skinned and
.cut into 8 pieces
1 lb 4 oz red potatoes, cut into
1/8" thick slices
1/4 c  White wine vinegar
Option: Instead of the whole
.chicken, you can use 2-3
.whole skinned chicken
.breasts, cut in halves
1.  Preheat the oven to 375F.  Spray an 8" square baking pan with
non-stick cooking spray.

2.  In a large bowl, combine the oil, garlic, salt, cinnamon, and
pepper. Add chicken and potatoes; toss well to coat thoroughly.

3.  Arrange chicken in a single layer in prepared baking pan; add
vinegar, then top evenly with potatoes. Bake 40-50 minutes, until
potatoes are tender, chicken is cooked thoroughly and thigh juices
run clear when pierced with a fork.  Serve topped with pan juices.

Lin's notes:  Since we don't like dark meat, I used 2-3 whole skinned
chicken breasts, cut in halves, and then cut in half again. I also
peeled the potatoes, as Pat doesn't like potato skins. It turned out
great! I served this with a green salad and white wine.
