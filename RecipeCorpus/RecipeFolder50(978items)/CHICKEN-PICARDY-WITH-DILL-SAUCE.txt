Please see the recipe for "Dill Sauce for Chicken Picardy" to
complete these directions.

TO PREPARE CHICKEN PICARDY: Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare
eight squares of aluminum foil by cutting foil into sheets (6" x 6")
and buttering them lightly on the shiny side.

Bone and skin chicken breasts. DO NOT HALVE. Flatten breasts between
sheets of waxed paper with knife edge and place each breast on a
square of foil.

Soak leeks. Separate and rinse well under running water to remove
sand. Finely slice green portion, allotting 1/2 green portion of a
leek to each breast. Chop mushrooms, spinach leaves, and shallots,
allowing
2    mushrooms per portion.

Saute this mixture very briefly (about 30 seconds) in a little butter
over medium heat. Place 1/4 of mixture on each breast. Splash about 1
ounce white wine over each breast, salt and pepper to taste, and roll
up each breast.

Seal each breast in an aluminum foil square. Fold ends tightly to
seal. Place prepared chicken into a baking pan filled with 2 or 3
inches of chicken stock and bake in a pre-heated oven for 25 minutes.

Saute cup of sliced leeks in butter over medium heat.

TO SERVE: Unwrap chicken breasts and slice into 1/4-inch rounds. Pour
a portion of Dill Sauce on a plate. Lay chicken rounds over sauce and
garnish with sauteed leek slices and serve.
