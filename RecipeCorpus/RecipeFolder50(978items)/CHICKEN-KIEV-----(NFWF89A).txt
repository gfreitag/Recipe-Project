Flatten the chicken breasts to a thickness of about 1/4 " by placing
them between pieces of wax paper and pounding them lightly with a
rolling pin or flat sided kitchen mallet. Lay out the breasts boned
side up (the unsmooth side). Salt to taste and sprinkle with the
pepper and chives. Place a finger of butter on each breast half. Roll
up the butter in thebreast meat as you would wrap a package, tucking
in the ends at the beginning. Dip the rolled breasts in flour, then
in the beaten eggs and finally in the bread crumbs. Chill in the
fridge for about 3 hours or more. Heat the oil to 365*F in a saucepan
or deep skillet. The oil should be deep enough to cover the breasts.
A Fry Daddy works great here. Deep fry the breasts for 4-5 minutes
uncrowded or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve
immediately. If frying in batches, keep others warm in an oven. I
like these served with warm Hollandaise sauce and a very slight
sprinkle of dill for color.   Enjoy GUY FROM: GUY ATTWOOD (NFWF89A)
