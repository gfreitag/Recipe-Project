Categories: Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
8 tb Sweet butter
2 tb Chopped scallions
1/2 lb Button mushrooms, whole
-or quartered large ones
-wiped, stems removed
Salt
Freshly ground white
-pepper
6    Prepared chicken breasts
-with skin removed,
-slightly flattened
1/2 c  Concentrated chicken
-stock*
1 ds Lemon juice
1 c  Heavy cream
1    Beurre Manie*
2 tb Finely chopped chives
* Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  These butter-flour balls
can be made ahead in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the
refrigerator for 1 or 2 weeks. Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter
on a small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork into a very
smooth paste. Roll the paste into a ball. In a small skillet, heat 2
T of butter. Add the scallions and cook for 2 or 3 minutes without
browning. Add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and cook the
mixture over high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes to brown the mushrooms
lightly. Reserve. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and
sprinkle them with lemon juice. In a large chicken fryer, melt the
remaining butter. When it is quite hot, add the chicken breasts and
cook them for 1 minute on each side. Cover the pan with buttered wax
paper and then the pan lid. Lower the heat and simmer the chicken
breasts for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the juices run out pale
yellow when pierced with a fork. Do not overcook or pierce every
piece. Immediately remove the chicken breasts to a serving platter.
Pour the chicken stock into the fryer, raise the heat and reduce the
stock until it is almost a glaze. Add the heavy cream and continue
cooking over high heat.  Add the Beurre Manie and cook until the
sauce heavily coats a spoon. Add the chives and correct the
seasoning. Add the mushroom & scallion mixture.  Add the chives and
correct the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts and
serve at once. From "Season Kitchen" by Perla Meyers. * DeLuxe2 1.25
