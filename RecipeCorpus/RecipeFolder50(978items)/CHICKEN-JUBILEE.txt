chicken pieces lightly with salt and spread them in a single layer in
a broiling pan. Broil until the skin is light gold, about 10 minutes
on each side. This is an effortless low-calorie way to brown chicken.
Place the chicken pieces in a large casserole. Drain the cherries and
save the syrup. Add 1/2 cup sherry to the syrup and add enough orange
juice to make 2 1/4 cups of liquid. Stir the lemon rind into the
liquid and pour over the chicken. Bring to a boil and simmer covered
over low heat until tender, about 30 minutes. STOP AT THIS POINT if
the dish is being prepared a day ahead. Remove the chicken and
refrigerate the chicken and cooking liquid separately overnight. Skim
off the congealed fat from the surface of the liquid. Return the
chicken to the liquid and reheat. Stir in the cherries. Mix the
cornstarch and 3 Tablespoons orange juice together and stir slowly
into the cooking liquid. Continue cooking a few minutes until the
sauce thickens. Serve with rice. YIELD: 4 to 6 servings. SOURCE: The
