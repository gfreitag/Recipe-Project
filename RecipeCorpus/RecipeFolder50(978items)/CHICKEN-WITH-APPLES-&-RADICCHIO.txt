Recipe by: SuperFoods by Dolores Riccio Heat oil in skillet or
electric fry pan. Brown chicken pieces over medium high heat. Pour
off any excess fat, leaving only 2 tbsp. Add shallots and r about 20
minutes. You should still have about 1/2 cup of pan juices but if the
skillet becomes too dry, add more cider.

Cut the unpeeled apples crosswise into 4 thick rounds each and lay
them ove the chicken. Cover and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, just until
the apples are the pan.

Mix cornstarch with remaining 1 cup of cider until there are no
lumps. Pour
