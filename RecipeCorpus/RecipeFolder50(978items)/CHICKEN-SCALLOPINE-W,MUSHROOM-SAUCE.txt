MMMMM---------------------OR VEAL SCALLOPINE--------------------------
2 tb Flour
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1    Egg
2 tb Water
1 1/2 c  Breadcrumbs
5 tb Olive Oil
2 tb Butter
CHICKEN:
Pound meat between sheets of waxed paper until thin. Combine flour,
salt and pepper in pie plate.  Beat egg with water in shallow dish.
Dredge meat in flour; dip in egg mixture; roll well in breadcrumbs.
LET SIT ON WAX PAPER FOR 10 MINUTES!!!  Heat oil and butter in large
skillet over medium-high heat.  Add meat in batches and saute until
browned, turning once, about 3-5 minutes, adding more oil and butter
if necessary. Keep warm and spoon mushroom sauce (see recipe).
MUSHROOM SAUCE:
Combine broth and flour in small bowl and stir until flour is
dissolved. Melt butter in skillet over medium high heat. Add onion
and saute until tender, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium; add
mushrooms; saute 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in broth. Increase heat to
medium high and cook until slightly thick, stirring occasionally,
about 10 minutes. Blend in cream, salt and pepper. Season to taste
with nutmeg and cayenne pepper. VARIATION: For thicker gravy, delete
the whipping cream. Gravy will also be browner too.  (Or add Kitchen
Bouquet to darken sauce.) NOTE: We find that if we are making this
for company it is best to use TWO frying pans to speed things up.
Also, this is wonderful when served with Fettucine Alfredo and
Stuffed Tomatoes!
