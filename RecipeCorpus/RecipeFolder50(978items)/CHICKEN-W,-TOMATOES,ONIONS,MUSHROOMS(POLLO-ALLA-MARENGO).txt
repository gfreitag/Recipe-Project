On June 14, 1800, Napol E9on Bonaparte defeated the Austrians at
Marengo, a village in southeast Piedmont. The town has given its name
to this chicken dish, which was cooked on the battlefield by Dunand,
chef to NapolE9on. It is still served throughout the area-as well as
in France-and is often made with veal. Serve with lots of bread to
soak up the juices; uncork a velvety red Barbaresco.
