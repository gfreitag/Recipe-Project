With an adult's help, chop the berries into small chunks, allowing
one or two per pancake face. Set aside.

With an adult's help, prepare the pancake mix according to package
directions. When the pancakes are done, place each serving in a stack
on a separate plate.

For every two stacks of pancakes, you need to peel one banana.
Carefully slice off the two ends and put one on top of each stack for
a nose. Then cut two thin slices from each endfor eyes. Then cut
banana in half for a long curved mouth.

Arrange the strawberry chunk chicken pox all around each face. Use
clean fingers to drop a pinch of powdered sugar on each pox for a
tasty bit of pus. Serves as many little polka dotted people as your
heart desires.
