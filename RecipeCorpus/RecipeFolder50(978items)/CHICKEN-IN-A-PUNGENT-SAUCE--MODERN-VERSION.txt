Title: CHICKEN IN A PUNGENT SAUCE--MODERN VERSION
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
2 ea 2-lb broilers
8 ea Slices bacon
2 c  Seedless grapes
2 tb Parsley; chopped fine
1 ea Mint sprig OR
1 1/2 ts Dried Mint
1/2 ts Pepper
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Saffron;(Powdered)
2 c  Chicken broth*
*Made from necks, gizzards, and livers Fry the bacon until crisp in a
large iron frying pan. Remove from the pan, drain on paper toweling,
break into small pieces and set aside. Brown slowly in the bacon fat
the broilers which have been quartered, necks removed.
When nicely browned, transfer the chicken to a large earthenware
casserole and keep warm.
Crush together 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, the dried powdered mint
or leaves of fresh mint chopped fine, the salt, freshly ground pepper
and saffron. Sprinkle over the chicken. Add to the brown residue in
the frying pan  the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, stir well and
pour over the chicken. Place the casserole on a flame tamer over low
heat, cover tightly and cook gently until the chicken is tender, or
for about 3O minutes. Drain off most of the juice into a small
saucepan and reduce to a syrupy consistency by boiling rapidly, for
about 5 minutes. Pour back over the chicken, sprinkle with another
tablespoon of chopped parsley and the pieces of bacon, and add the
grapes.
A macedoine of cooked chopped carrots, string beans, lima beans and
peas, well buttered, would be good with this dish. Source: The
