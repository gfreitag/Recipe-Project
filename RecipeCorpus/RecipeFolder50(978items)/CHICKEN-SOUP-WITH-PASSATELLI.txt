Categories: Soups, Italian, Poultry, Ew
Yield: 8 Cups
8 c  Homemade chicken broth
2 lg Carrots, chopped
1    Stalk celery, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, peeled &
-crushed
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Fresh breadcrumbs
2/3 c  Grated Parmesan cheese,
-plus extra for garnish
1 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
2 lg Eggs
1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
Pour chicken broth into a large pot and bring to a boil. Add carrots,
celery, garlic and salt.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer
for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine breadcrumbs,
cheese and nutmeg.  Make a well in the center and add eggs; mix until
thoroughly combined.  The dough should be damp but firm. If
necessary, incorporate additional breadcrumbs or a few drops of
water; if the dough is too wet or too dry it will crumble.  To form
the passatelli, pinch off a piece of dough and roll it about 1/4 inch
thick, then break it into 1/2 inch lengths. Continue forming the rest
of the dough in the same manner. Bring the broth back to a boil, add
the passatelli and parsley and cook for 5 minutes. Ladle the soup
into bowls, sprinkle with a little Parmesan and serve.
