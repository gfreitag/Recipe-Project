The following few posts are from "Mother Magyar", by Meryl Constance
writing in the Sydney Morning Herald. The article is about Agi Adler,
a Jewish lady who emigrated to Australia as a young woman shortly
after WWII. Though she didn't know how to cook anything then, let
alone Hungarian food, over the years she learned the art. The
following recipes comprise an Hungarian feast and observe Jewish
dietary laws. They look quite good and are remarkably simple.  So
good that I typed them in by hand... There was a crease across them
that drove my scanner bonkers.

Maybe Mark can help us out with terms like "Becel margarine" and "No.
15 chicken"...

Put the marrow bone, chicken carcasses and giblets in a large pot
with 2 litres of water.  Bring to the boil, skim and reduce to a slow
simmer. Meanwhile, chop vegetables. After the soup has been simmering
for half an hour, add the vegetables and parsley stems and continue
cooking for about 2 hours.  Strain the broth, reserving the carrots
and giblets. Add salt to taste.  Slice the carrots and giblets and
return them to the soup.

In a separate pot of boiling water, cook the noodles and then drain
them. divide the noodles between 8 soup plates and ladle the soup
over it. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.
