Title: CHICKEN TANDOORI #2
Categories: Indian, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 lb Chicken pieces
1 md Onion, minced
3    Cloves garlic chopped
1 ts Fresh chopped ginger
10 oz Natural yoghurt
1    Lemon rind & juice
2 tb Vinegar
1 ts Paprika
2 ts Garam masala
2 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Red food colouring
Skin chicken pieces, score with sharp knife. In non-metallic bowl,mix
all ingredients. Marinate chicken in mixture overnight, turning to
marinate evenly. Cook on brazier bbq so that flames have direct
contact with chicken (ie not on a hot-plate), or in a vertical grill
on maximum heat. The object here is to emulate the tandoor as much as
possible in cooking with intense, dry heat.

Serve with rice, naan, lettuce, onion rings, cucumber slices and lemon
wedges.

I personally add ground mint and ground very hot chilli powder the
above marinade. I probably don't want to know what the original red
coloured powder is in the tandoori powder I buy from Indian spice
merchants, but it adds to the authenticity. I now mainly use a powder
tandoori marinate from Keens. It is cheap, easy and authentic. Have
fun.
