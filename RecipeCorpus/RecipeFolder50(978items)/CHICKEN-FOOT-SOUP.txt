Directions: Wash them chickens feet... scrub between toes... remove
"toe-jam". Rinse in clear water.

Wash and de-fat chicken breasts... remove skin and bones. Cut into
small pieces. Pat dry with paper towels, and saute in hot oil or
butter for a few minutes.

Add vegetables... and spices...saute a few minutes more. Stir, make
onions soft but not browned. Add a little wine, cook over low heat
for a few minutes while you drink a cup of the wine and some of the
liquid evaporates... oh, yeah... do not cover skillet.

Boil water... add bouillion and dissolve (the bouillion). Throw in the
whole mess from the skillet, all meat and vegetables... toss in the
feet... bring to a boil and then simmer until the chicken is cooked
and tender. Have another cup of wine.

NOW... in a clean skillet... heat some oil... add some flour, equal
measure... maybe 1/4 cup, each... over moderate heat, make a "roux"...
browning the flour/oil mixture, but do not burn... add to the soup.

Cook the whole thing until slightly thickened... remove from heat...
add the rest of the wine...heh...heh... cover... let set a few
minutes... and serve with cooked rice (maybe add cooked rice to the
soup... or seperately)... Open a second bottle of wine to serve with
the soup...
