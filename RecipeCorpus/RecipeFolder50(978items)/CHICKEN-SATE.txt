Title: CHICKEN SATE
Categories: Thai, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lg Skinless, Boneless Chicken
-Breast Halves (About
1 1/2    Pounds)
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
1 tb Salad Oil
1 tb Molasses
1/4 ts Crushed Red Pepper Flakes
1 lg Clove Garlic, Crushed
Lemon Juice
1/2 c  Creamy Peanut Butter
ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS BEFORE SERVING:

With a meat mallet or dull edge of a French knife, pound each of the
chicken breast halves to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the chicken
breasts, lengthwise, into 1-inch wide strips.

In a large bowl, mix the chicken strips, soy sauce, salad oil,
molasses, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and 2 Tbls lemon juice.
Cover and refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for at least 2
hours, stirring occasionally.  Meanwhile, soak sixteen 6-inch long
bamboo skewers in water to prevent charring when broiling.

ABOUT 25 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING:

Preheat the broiler if the manufacturer directs. Thread the chicken
strips onto the bamboo skewers. Place the bamboo skewers on the rack
in a broiling pan.  Brush generously with the marinade.  Place the
pan in the broiler at the closest position to the source of heat.
Broil 4 to 5 minutes until the chicken just loses its pink color and
is tender, turning the skewers once and brushing the chicken with the
remaining marinade frequently.

While the chicken is broiling, in a small bowl, blend the peanut
butter, 2 Tbls lemon juice, and 1/2 cup hot water using a fork and
mixing until smooth.  Serve the chicken with this peanut sauce.
