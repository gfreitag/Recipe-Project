Brown chicken (pork) in olive oil with garlic and almonds. When it is
beginning to brown nicely, add sliced onions and mushrooms. Saute
until onion turns clear. Season with salt and pepper, but go lightly
with the salt (because of the olives). Add wine, mint, and parsley.
Cover and simmer about 30 minutes.  While simmering, pit the olives.
About five minutes before serving, add the olives and heat through.
You may serve this with rice and a garden salad.
