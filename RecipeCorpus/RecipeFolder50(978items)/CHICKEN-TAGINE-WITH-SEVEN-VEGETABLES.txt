Title: CHICKEN TAGINE WITH SEVEN VEGETABLES
Categories: Moroccan, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 1/2 lb Chicken
1 tb Olive oil
1 3/4 lb Eggplant
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Onions, chopped
3    Garlic cloves, crushed
3 c  Stock, chicken
1 1/2    Cinnamon sticks
1 ts Curry powder
1 ts Cumin, ground
1/4 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Black pepper
1    Turnips
1 md Zucchini
1    Carrots
1/2    Bell peppers, red
3 md Tomatoes
1/2 c  Raisins
1 tb Parsley
Cut chicken into serving pieces.  Remove backs and wings and save for
soup. Remove all skin and fat from chicken. Heat oil in large frying
pan; saute chicken in 2 batches until opaque on both sides (a few
minutes). Set aside.

Cut unpeeled eggplant into 1" cubes; salt for 20 minutes, then drain
and rinse.  Heat oil in 6-8-qt Dutch oven. Add onion, garlic, and
eggplant. Saute over low heat until onion is just tender, 5-10
minutes.

Add stock, cinnamon, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and black pepper.
Stir, bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes.

Peel turnip; dice turnip, zucchini, carrot, and bell pepper. Add dark
meat and diced vegetables to Dutch oven. Simmer, uncovered, 10
minutes.

Dice tomatoes.  Add chicken breasts, tomato, raisins, and parsley,
pushing down lightly to be sure ingredients are covered by liquid.
Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes more.

Serve hot in deep soup bowls on top of rice, noodles, or couscous,
garnishing top with coriander.

Sylvia's notes: I used a whole chicken and dumped everything in the
crockpot, which worked fine except that the vegetables weren't done
(since it cooked about 6 hours instead of the usual 10 when I use the
cp on a workday), so I boiled the vegetables in the stock until they
were soft. However, I was not pleased with the result, and I think it
was the combination of flavors (or lack thereof) rather than the
cooking method. The chicken was fine, and the broth was delicious,
but the vegetables were tasteless cardboard.
