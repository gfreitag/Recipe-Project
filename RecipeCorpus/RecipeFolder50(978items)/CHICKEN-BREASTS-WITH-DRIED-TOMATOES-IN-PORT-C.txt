almost certainly at health food stores. If not available mince dried
whole tomatoes in processor.

Saute' chicken breasts in butter over medium high heat, 3 minutes on
one side; turn and cook 2 minutes more. Chicken is done when springy
to the touch (these directions yield an incredibly tender chicken).
Remove Chicken from the pan and keep warm.

Add the minced tomatoes, wine and cream to the dripping in the pan
and boil uncovered over high heat until BIG SHINY bubbles form..about
15 minutes (they will suddenly appear) stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, cook pasta uncovered in 3 quarts boiling water until al
dente, drain onto platter.

Add Chicken to port mixture in pan, add salt and pepper to taste.
Spoon chicken and sauce over pasta and serve.
