Title: CHICKEN STUFF-A-RONI WITH CHEESE SAUCE
Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Cheese/eggs, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Finely chopped cooked
- chicken or turkey
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1/4 c  Minced parsley (optional)
1/4 ts Ground thyme
1/4 ts Garlic salt
1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
1 c  Grated cheddar cheese, med.
1/4 c  Dry white wine - or gravy
Salt and pepper to taste
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Flour
3 c  Chicken broth - I use
- homemade gravy instead
1 c  Milk
2 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
1/4 ts Tobasco
Salt and pepper to taste
In bowl, combine filling ingredients; salt and pepper to taste

In Saucepan, melt butter, add flour.  Stir in broth and milk; cook
until thickened, stirring frequently. Add remaining ingredients.

Fill Stuff-a-roni.

Cover bottom of 2 quart baking dish with 1 cup cheese sauce. Arrange
filled stuff-a-roni in single layer in baking dish. Cover with
remaining sauce.

Cover dish with foil and bake at 375-degrees F., for one hour; or
cover dish with waxed paper and microwave
30    minutes turning once.

Note: I usually make this dish after Thanksgiving.  I freeze left over
turkey and gravy, and then later, when turkey seems like a treat
again, I make the Stuff-a-roni. I do not use the wine; in it's place
I use turkey gravy, and when it calls for broth, I also use a fair
portion of turkey gravy.
