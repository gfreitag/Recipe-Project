Hey++just found this one in a Cookbook Digest.  It might work well in
the Romertopf.  Or the Chinese sandy pots for that matter.

The traditional way to prepare this chicken dish from Michoacan, is
in a clay casserole dish covered with a sealing layer of ground corn
or masa. Small bits of the corn mixture break off and add a
thickening texture to the sauce.  This modern version is much simpler
to prepare.

Rub the chicken with the garlic, salt, and pepper and refrigerate for
2 to 4 hours.

In a large skillet, heat the corn oil, saute the chicken briefly and
transfer to a cazuela or large pot. In the same oil, lightly brown the
potatoes, remove, and set aside. Add the vinegar to the skillet and
bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the
skillet. Pour the vinegar through a strainer over the chicken.

Add the olive oil, salt, bay leaves, thyme, and marjoram to the
chicken cazuela.  Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, and lower
the heat. Every 10 minutes, uncover and stir. After 35 minutes,
uncover, correct the seasonings, and add the chiles and potatoes.
Cover and cook over low heat until the potatoes are tender, about 15
minutes.

Makes 6 servings.
