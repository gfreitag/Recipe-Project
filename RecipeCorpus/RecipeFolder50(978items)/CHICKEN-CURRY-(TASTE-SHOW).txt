Title: CHICKEN CURRY (TASTE SHOW)
Categories: New, Text, Import
2    3-pound chickens, cut into
serving-size pieces, --
skinned
Yield: 4 Servings
:
:
10 TB vegetable oil
6 c  thinly sliced onions
2 TB finely chopped garlic
3 TB finely chopped ginger
2    cinnamon sticks
8    cardamom pods
1 TB turmeric
1 ts cayenne
2 c  canned crushed tomatoes
1 TB kosher salt
1 TB ground roasted cumin seeds
or ground cumin
:
4 TB chopped cilantro leaves

In a large heavy-bottomed pan, preferably with a nonstick surface,
heat 2 tablespoons oil over high heat. When oil is very hot add
chicken, a few pieces at a time, and sear until browned on all sides,
about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove chicken to a plate and
continue until all pieces are browned.

Add remaining oil and onions to pan, reduce heat to medium-high and
fry 30 minutes until light brown, stirring constantly to prevent
burning. Add garlic and ginger and fry 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and
cardamom and fry 2 minutes, until spices are puffed and beginning to
brown. Add turmeric and cayenne and stir rapidly 15 seconds. Return
chicken to pan and stir in tomatoes, salt and 2 cups boiling water.
Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook about 45 minutes, until
chicken is tender and gravy has thickened. Check frequently, and add
a little water if sauce is evaporating too quickly. Turn off heat and
let dish rest, covered at least 1 hour, preferably 2. When ready to
serve, reheat, fold in cumin and cilantro, and adjust seasonings if
needed.

Yield: 8 servings
