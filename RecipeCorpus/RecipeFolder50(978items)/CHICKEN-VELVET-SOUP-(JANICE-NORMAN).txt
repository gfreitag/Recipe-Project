From Fred Peters:

Broth: 1 chicken (about 5 lb) 2 1/2 quarts water

Soup: 3/4 c butter (room temperature) 3/4 c flour 2 c light cream (OR
half-and-half) 6 c chicken stock, heated 1 1/2 c cooked chicken
breast, finely chopped Salt, to taste, if desired Freshly ground
black pepper, to taste 1 c fresh parsley, snipped, to garnish

Broth:  Simmer the chicken  for about 1 hour.  Remove the chicken and
cool; remove the meat from the bones. Reserve the white meat and save
the remainder for other uses.

Soup:  Blend the butter and flour together in a mdm (3-quart)
saucepan. Warm the cream in a seperate pan. Add the warmed cream to
the butter-flour mixture and stir until smooth. It will start to
thicken when it is heated. Stir in two c of the hot stock. Cook over
low heat, stirring, until heated through and blended, about 4
minutes. Add an additional 4 c of stock and the chopped chicken.
Season to taste with salt, if desired, and pepper. Heat to serving
temperature--steaming, but not boiling or the cream will break. Watch
the pot closely to keep from coming to a boil.

Serve from a heated tureen and ladle into heated bowls. Garnish with
snippets of fresh parsley.
