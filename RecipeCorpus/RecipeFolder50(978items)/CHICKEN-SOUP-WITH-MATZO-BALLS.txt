Title: CHICKEN SOUP WITH MATZO BALLS
Categories: Soups, Jewish, Poultry, Ew
Yield: 10 Cups
2 lg Eggs
1 lg Egg white
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Matzo meal
1 tb Oil
8 c  Homemade chicken broth
2    Parsnips, peeled & chopped
1 lg Carrot, peeled & chopped
1    Onion, chopped
1 c  Broccoli florets
1 c  Sliced mushrooms
2 tb Chopped fresh dill or
-parsley
In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, egg white and salt. Whisk in
matzo meal, oil and 3 T cold water. Cover and chill the mixture at
least 1 hour or overnight. In a large pot, bring chicken broth to a
boil. Add parsnips, carrots and onions, reduce the heat to medium-low
and cook for 5 minutes. Gently roll the chilled matzo dough by level
teaspoonfuls into balls, dropping them into the simmering broth as
you work. Cook the matzo balls, covered, for 15 minutes. Do not lift
the lid; the broth must simmer rapidly to allow the matzo balls to
expand properly.  Uncover the pot, add broccoli and mushrooms and
simmer until the broccoli is just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle into
bowls, sprinkle with dill or parsley and serve.
