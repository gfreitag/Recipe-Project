1 ea Chicken*
1 x  Celery
1 x  Red onion; finely minced, as
2/3 c  Raisins; soak in rum

1 c  Chopped walnuts,
2 ea Red delicious apples
1 x  DRESSING
1 c  Mayonnaise (preferably home
1/2 c  Sour cream

1 x  Cayenne pepper, if desired
1 ts Cinnamon
* roasted, skin removed, meat cut into bite peel left on, core out,
cut in bite size chunks, mango, papaya, pineapple - cut into bite
sized chunks--as desired. Salt and freshly ground black pepper to
taste Combine all the dressing ingredients, taste and adjust the
seasoning. Sometimes I crush some fresh pineapple into the dressing.
It makes for a nice addition.
Depending on how much meat you have on the chicken, you may need
more or less of the dressing.  Use your judgement. Mix the chicken
with the fruit and nuts and toss with the dressing. I serve this on a
huge platter lined with---> red cabbage and green savoy cabbage
leaves--it is gorgeous!
