2 1/2 lb Young chicken

This colorful dish is also very simple to make. Kin Hwa refers to the
delicious ham from Jinhua. Chicken, a la Kin Hwa, is traditionally
served with the head as a center piece.

Clean the chicken, plunge it into a pot of boiling water, immediately
turn off the heat and put on a tight lid. Leave the chicken in the
hot water for an hour, then take it out and leave it to cool.

Carefully remove the meat from the bone but keep the skin on; cut the
chicken into 24 pieces. Cut the ham into 24 thin slices.

Arrange the chicken and ham slices in alternating overlapping layers
on a plate, and steam for 10 minutes. Meanwhile parboil the greens in
chicken stock until soft, then arrange them around the chicken and
ham.

In a little saucepan, warm about half a cup of chicken stock with
salt, sugar, monosodium glutamate and cornstarch (corn flour); stir
to make it smooth; add sesame seed oil and pour it over the chicken
and ham. Serve either as a starter for a banquet or as a main course
for an informal meal.
