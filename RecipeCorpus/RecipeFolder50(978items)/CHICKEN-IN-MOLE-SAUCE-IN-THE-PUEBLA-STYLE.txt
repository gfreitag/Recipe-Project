Title: CHICKEN IN MOLE SAUCE IN THE PUEBLA STYLE
Categories: Sauces, Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings  1.5 kg chicken fillets (breast or thigh)
2    tablespoons oil
3    tablespoons mole paste
1    small onion, quartered
1    clove of garlic
3    peeled tomatoes
1    small ripe banana
1/2    tablespoon sugar salt to taste
2    tablespoons sesame seeds

Bring 800 ml water to the boil, add the chicken fillets and simmer
until just stiffened. Remove the chicken pieces and cover to prevent
their drying out. Reserve the resulting chicken stock.

Heat oil in a large saucepan and fry mole paste until fragrant. In a
blender or food processor combine onion, garlic, tomato, banana and
sugar. Add this paste to the mole in the saucepan. Stir and simmer
over low heat for 3 minutes.

Add 3 cups chicken stock, cover and cook over a low heat for 15
minutes, until mixture thickens to a creamy consistency. If too
thick, add a little more stock. Taste for chilli heat; if it is too
hot, add extra sugar or blended tomato.

Meanwhile dry-fry sesame seeds in a pan until golden brown and
fragrant. Add chicken pieces to the sauce, heat through and serve
sprinkled with sesame seeds.
