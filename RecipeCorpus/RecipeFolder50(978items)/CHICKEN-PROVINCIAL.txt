Disjoint chicken and cook in pressure cooker for 15-20 minutes along
with parsley, bayleaf, onion, salt, peppercorns, and celery. If you
don't have a pressure cooker, you can use any large pot, and cook as
long as necessary over medium heat until chicken is very tender.
Remove chicken, drain, and slice off meat, removing all skin. Do not
discard stock. Keep chicken warm. Skim fat from the stock, and
reserve 1 cup. In a heavy skillet, heat oil. Stir in flour, and cook
until brown. Add 1 cup chicken stock and peas. Cover and simmer 6-8
minutes. Uncover, add milk, lemon juice and rind, salt and pepper.
Bring to boil, and reduce heat and cook until thickened. On a large
platter, place the mashed potatoes, rice, or noodles. On top of that,
arrange the warmed chicken, and top with the peas mixture. Garnish
with parsley. (works well with leftover chicken or turkey)
