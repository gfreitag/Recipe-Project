Title: CHICKEN PIZZA WITH THREE CHEESES
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Recipe Basic pizza dough
1/2 lb Boneless skinless chicken
Breasts
Juice of one lemon
2 ts Dried oregano
Yellow cornmeal for pizza
Pan
1/2 c  Bottled barbeque sauce
2 oz Cheddar cheese
1 oz Mozzarella cheese, part skim
Milk -- shredded
1 oz Provolone cheese
10    Scallion -- chopped
Combine chicken lemon juice and oregano in small bowl Let stand at
room temp. for 30 minutes.  Preheat broiler. Broil chicken 2 inches
from heat for about 3 minutes on each side, or until no longer pink
in center. Remove chicken from oven. Variation:  I used Sam's already
cooked mesquite Chicken breasts 1 1/2 breast cut in cubes, and
sprinkled oregano over the pizza. I elimintated the lemon. Lower oven
temp. to 500 degrees. Cut chicken into small pieces. Form dough and
place on pizza peel. Brush barbeque sauce over crust. Bake on stone
for 3-5 minutes. Do not allow bar-b-que sauce to burn. You can put a
fourth of the bar-b-que sauce on and then add the other 1/4 prior to
putting on chicken and cheese; if you like a saucy taste Combine
Cheeses in small bowl.  Scatter chicken over prebaked crust. Scatter
scallions, then add cheese. I eliminated scallions. I used 1/2
mesquite bar-b-que sauce and 1/2 of KC masterpiece honey terryiaki.
Bake for about 6- 8 minutes or until crust is browned. Let stand for
5 minutes before cutting. Nutritional Information: 164 cal/slice.
