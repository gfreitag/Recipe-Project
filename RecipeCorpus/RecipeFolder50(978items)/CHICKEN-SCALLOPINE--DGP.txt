Chill. In a large skillet heat butter until it sizzles. Saute'
cutlets, 3 or 4 at a time, 2-3 minutes per side. Drain on paper
towels and keep warm until all are cooked. Stir lemon juice and wine
into drippings and scrape bottom to loosen particles. Heat but don't
boil. Add capers. Spoon pan juices over cutlets on serving platter

served with Fettucine and garnished with slice lemon twists and
