2    Longhorn cheese; grated
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
1/2    Milk
8 oz Sour cream
1 sm Green chiles; diced
Recipe by: Tim Dean Mix together soup, milk, sour cream and chilies.
Set aside in mixing bowl. Grease a 6" deep by 9" round casserole
dish. Tear at least four tortillas into large pieces, using them to
cover the bottom of the casserole dish.  Put 1/3 of the chicken on
top of the tortillas. Pour 1/3 of the soup mixture on top of the
chicken, then cover with a layer of grated cheese.  Repeat the steps
with tortillas, chicken, soup mixture and cheese, twice (if your dish
isn't deep enough, only make two layers). After last layer of cheese
is put on top of casserole, bake in a 325 degree oven for 45 minutes,
uncovered. Cheese should be melted and tortillas well-cooked.  For
spicier palates, more green chilies may be added.
