Blend together the garlic, salt, bay leaves, oregano, olive oil and
lemon juice. Rub under the breast skin and over all surfaces of
chicken. Place chicken in a Dutch oven and pour in the broth. Cover
and roast in a preheated 375 degree F. oven for 20 minutes. Reduce
oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and roast 50 minutes longer. Check
halfway through cooking to make sure there is still some broth in the
pot. Add 1/2 cup water or broth if necessary.

Take chicken from pot and let cool. Remove and discard skin. Pull
chicken into shreds or chunks.
