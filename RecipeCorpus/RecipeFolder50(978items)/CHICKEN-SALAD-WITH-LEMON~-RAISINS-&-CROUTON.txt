1. TO PREPARE THE CROUTONS: Spray a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the
olive oil spray or nonstick cooking spray. Spread the bread cubes on
the sheet and spray lightly again 3 times. Place in a preheated
350-degree F oven about 20 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the
oven and cool. 2. TO PREPARE THE SALAD: Place the chicken in a pan
and cover with water. Bring just to a boil, cover and reduce the heat
to medium-low. Cook 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
Remove from the liquid and cool. Cut into small chunks or pull into
shreds. 3. Combine the chicken with the celery, raisins and lemon
peel. 4. TO PREPARE THE DRESSING: In a bowl, stir together the
yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, honey, rosemary, salt and
pepper. Stir into the salad, cover and refrigerate until ready to
serve. 5. Wash the romaine and radicchio, pat dry and wrap in paper
towels. Refrigerate. 6. When ready to serve, stir together 2
teaspoons lemon juice and 1 teaspoon olive oil.  Tear the lettuce
into small pieces and toss with the lemon-oil mixture. Divide between
plates and top with the chicken salad. Garnish with the croutons.
Note: If radicchio is unavailable or too expensive, substitute red
leaf lettuce.
