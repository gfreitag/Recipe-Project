serving, if you wish. Prepare dressing by combining all dressing
ingredients, including Parmesan in a bowl.  Whisk until well blended.
For best flavor, prepare dressing at least several hours before
using. Refrigerate if making a day ahead. 2.  Roast Chicken Breasts,
uncovered in a preheated 375F oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until
chicken feels springy. Alternately, place chicken breasts, thin ends
toward centre, in a microwave-safe pie plate. Cover with clear wrap
and microwave on high for 10 to 15 minutes. Rearrange and turn
halfway through cooking.  Let stand covered, for 3 minutes. 3. Cut
cooked chickien into 1/2 inch pieces. Pieces should measure about 2
1/2 cups. Set aside.  Thinly slice mushrooms. Seed red pepper and cut
into thin julienne strips about  1 1/2 inches long. Seed hot pepper
if using and finely chop. If making salad ahead, combine chicken,
mushrooms and peppers in a large bowl.  Cover and refrigerate until
ready to use. 4. When ready to serve, tear lettuce into bite-size
pieces. Place in a large sald bowl. Add chicken and vegetables. Whisk
dressing. Drizzle 1/2 cup dressing over top and toss until evenly
coated. Then add remaining dressing, if necessary. Toss until evenly
coated. Source: Gail
