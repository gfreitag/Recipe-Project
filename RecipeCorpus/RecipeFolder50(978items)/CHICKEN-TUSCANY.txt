Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Chopped fresh oregano,
-divided
2 tb Chopped fresh thyme, divided
2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary,
-divided
2    Cloves garlic, minced,
-divided
1/4 ts Coarsely ground black
-pepper, divided
4    6-ounce boneless, skinless
-chicken breast halves
4 tb Plus 1 1/2 teaspoons olive
-oil, divided
1/4 c  Chopped shallots
1 c  Marsala wine
1 c  Homemade or canned chicken
-broth
2 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
1/2 c  Sun-dried tomatoes,
-julienned
1/2 c  Sliced green onions
1 1/2 c  Butter, cut into small
-pieces (3 sticks)
In a small flat dish, sprinkle half the oregano, thyme, rosemary,
garlic and black pepper.  Place the chicken breast halves in a single
layer on top of the herbs. Pour 4 tablespoons olive oil over the
chicken. Sprinkle the remaining herbs, garlic and pepper over the
chicken breasts. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
overnight.

While chicken is marinating, prepare the Marsala reduction. In a
saucepan, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil. Add shallots and saute
until tender. Add the Marsala and chicken broth and stir to scrape up
any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Bring to a simmer and
cook until reduced by half. Skim off excess fat and strain to remove
shallots. Set aside.

Grill or broil chicken breasts for about 7 to 8 minutes per side or
until done.  While the chicken is cooking, preheat a saute pan. Add
the Marsala reduction, mushrooms, tomatoes and green onions. Bring to
a simmer and reduce by half.  Remove from heat and stir the butter
into the sauce bit by bit, stirring constantly, until the sauce is
slightly thickened.

Serve the chicken breasts topped with the sauce.

Makes 4 servings.
