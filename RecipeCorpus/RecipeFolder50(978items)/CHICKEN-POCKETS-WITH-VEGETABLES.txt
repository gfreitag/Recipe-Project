Title: CHICKEN POCKETS WITH VEGETABLES
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Mushrooms
1/2 lb Spinach
4 tb Corn oil
1/2 c  Onions, chopped
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1/2 ts Oregano
4    Chicken breasts
3 tb Dry white wine
Fresh parsley, chopped
Lemon wedges
1. Rinse, pat-dry and chop mushrooms; set aside.

2. Wash spinach; place in saucepan and cook, covered, only with the
water clinging to the leaves, until barely wilted. Drain spinach
well, squeezing out excess water. Chop and set aside.

3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet until hot; add onion and
mushrooms and saute until tender. Add garlic, oregano, spinach, and
pepper to taste. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Set aside.

4. Meanwhile, flatten each chicken breast by placing between 2 layers
of waxed paper or plastic wrap; pound with rolling pin or heavy plate
edge until about 1/4-inch thick.

5. Spoon 1/4th of mushroom mixture onto center of each chicken
breast; roll lengthwise and secure with wooden toothpicks. Place
breasts in a 9-inch shallow baking pan.

6. Combine wine with remaining oil and spoon over chicken. Bake,
uncovered, in preheated 400-degree oven until chicken is tender,
about 15 to 20 minutes. Baste often.

7. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve with lemon wedges.
