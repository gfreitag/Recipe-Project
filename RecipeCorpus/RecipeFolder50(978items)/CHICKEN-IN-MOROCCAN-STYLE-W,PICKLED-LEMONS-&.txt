-in serving pieces
2 tb Coarse salt
7    Garlic cloves
1 c  Vegetable oil
2 ts Ginger
1 c  Vegetable oil
2 ts Ginger

3 lg Onions, grated
4 tb Butter
2 c  Chicken broth
1 c  Soft ripe olives, preferably

Rub the chicken pieces well with a mixture of the salt and 4 of the
garlic cloves, finely chopped.  Let stand 1 hour for flavors to
penetrate then wipe off the garlic salt. Mix the oil, ginger,
turmeric, pepper and saffron, and rub the chicken pieces with this
mixture. Put them in a large bowl with any remaining oil mixture and
marinate, covered and refrigerated for
8    hours or overnight.

To cook, put the chicken pieces in a large pot with the onion,
remaining garlic, coarsely chopped, butter chicken broth and 2 cups
water. Simmer until tender, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove chicken
and rapidly boil the liquid down to a thick, rich sauce, stirring
frequently. Add the olives and pickled lemon slices, replace chicken,
and reheat in the sauce. Serve with couscous or rice pilaf and a bowl
of extra pickled lemons.

Pickled lemons:  These keep for months in the refrigerator and are
worth making in quantity.

6 lemons vegetable oil coarse salt

Slice the lemons about 1/4 inch thick, peel and all, put in a
colander, sprinkle heavily with salt.  Cover with plastic wrap and
drain over a bowl for 24 hours, until limp, with most of the juice
drawn out. Wash off salt.

Pack the lemon slices into a 1 quart jar, sprinkling them with about 2
Tablespoons more salt.  Fill the jar with vegetable oil. Cover jar
with lid and let lemons stand from 1 to 3 weeks, by which time they
will be soft, mellow and not at all bitter.
