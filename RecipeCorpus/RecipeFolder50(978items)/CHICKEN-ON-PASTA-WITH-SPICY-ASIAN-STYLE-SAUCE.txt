Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Vegetable Oil
6    Garlic cloves, minced
3    Jalapeno chilies, seeded and
Minced
1 1/2 c  Unsweetened coconut milk
1/3 c  Smooth peanut butter
1/3 c  Soy sauce
2 tb Fresh lime juice
2 tb Sesame oil
2 tb Minced, peeled fresh ginger
1 tb Honey
1 1/2 ts Tabasco sauce
3/4 c  Diced red bell pepper
1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
1 lb Skinless, boneless chicken
Breast halves, cut into 1/4
Inch wide strips
1 lb Linguine
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add
garlic and jalapenos; saute until tender but not brown, about 3 mins.
Add the coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, sesame
oil, ginger, honey and tabasco and mix well, until smooth. Bring to a
simmer. Take off heat and season (if needed) with salt and pepper. (I
added pepper, but didn't think it needed salt!)  You can stop at this
point, if desired and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Heat 1 tbsp.
oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the red pepper,
mushrooms and green onions and cook for about 3 mins. Add the
skinless, boneless chicken and cook until done. (About 5 mins.) Add
this to the sauce. Cook the pasta in a pot of salted, boiling water
until tender, but not overdone. Drain. Bring sauce to a simmer and
pour over pasta.  Toss well until coated. Serve.
