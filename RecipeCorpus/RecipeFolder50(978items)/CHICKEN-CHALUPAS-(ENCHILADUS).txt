Title: CHICKEN CHALUPAS (ENCHILADUS)
Categories: Chicken, Casseroles
Yield: 8 Servings
6    Flour tortillas; *see below
2 lg Chicken breasts; cooked and
-cut up in small pieces
1 cn Cream of Chicken soup
8 oz Can diced green chilies;
-(I used mild)
1/2 pt Sour cream
1/3 lb Jack cheese; grated
1/3 lb Sharp cheese; grated
1/2 cn Sliced black olives
1 sm Onion; grated
Green onion tops
Combine soup, onion, green onion tops, sour cream, chilies, and black
olives.  Add most of the cheeses, saving some for the top. Set aside
1 cup of this mixture without the chicken. Then add the cut up
chicken to the remaining mixture.

In a 9 X 13 greased shallow baking dish fill each tortilla with some
of the chicken mixture and roll up, folding ends in if you so desire.
Pour remaining sauce over the top of filled tortillas and sprinkle
with remaining cheese.  (Sprinkle with paprika if you choose.)
Refrigerate overnight.

At this point they can be frozen for later use. Then thaw in
refrigerator over night before baking.

Bake at 350^ for 45 minutes.

*This will fill 6 large size or 8-9 med size tortillas.
