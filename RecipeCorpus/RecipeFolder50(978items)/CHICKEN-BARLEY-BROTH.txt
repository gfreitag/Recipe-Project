2 qt Water
1/2 c  Pearled Barley
1 lg Onion -- Chopped
2 ts Poultry Seasoning
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper

Combine chicken thighs, water, barley, onion, poultry seasoning, salt,
pepper, paprika and bay leaf in a dutch oven. Bring to boil. Cover,
reduce heat and simmer until chicken is fork-tender, about 45
minutes. Remove chicken; skim fat brom broth unless you're planning
to chill the finished soup overnight.  The chilled fat could be
lifted off just before reheating.

Cool chicken; remove meat from bones and dice.  Set aside. Add
carrots, celery and mushrooms to broth. Cover; simmer 20 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Return diced chicken to soup and peas and
parsley. Discard bay leaf; Cook until soup is heated through.
