Title: CHICKEN PILAF ATZEM (EPIRUS STYLE)
Categories: Greek, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1    Frying chicken (2-1/2 lbs)*
4 tb Butter or vegetable oil
1 lg Onion; diced
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1    Cinnamon stick (optional)
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
1 1/2 c  Raw long-grain white rice
*Note: To make Lamb Pilaf Atzem, substitute 2 lbs. lean lamb chunks
for the chicken.

Wash, dry and cut the chicken into serving pieces.  In an attractive
cooking-serving casserole, heat the butter, and saute the chicken and
the onion, turning the chicken pieces constantly. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper, then add cinnamon stick, tomato sauce, and enough water
to almost cover the meat.  Cover and simmer on top of the stove or
bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40 minutes. Pour out the liquid,
measure, and if necessary add enough water to make 3 cups. Pour back
into the casserole, add the rice and shake the pan a few times to mix
the rice in. Continue cooking, uncovered, for 20 minutes longer, or
until all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Remove from the
heat and drape with a dry towel for 5 minutes. Serve hot.
