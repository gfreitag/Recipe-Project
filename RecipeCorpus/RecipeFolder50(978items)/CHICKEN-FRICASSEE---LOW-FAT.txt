Categories: Chicken, Low-cal
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2    Chicken - about 1 lb.,
-skinned & all fat cut away
1/2 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 c  Flour - all purpose
1    Egg white
1/4 c  Skim milk

1/4 c  Dry brown "roux" - see
-recipe
1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Onion - chopped
1/2 c  Green onion - chopped
2    Clove garlic - minced
1 tb Parsley - finely chopped
1/8 ts Allspice - ground
1/4 ts Thyme
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
PREPARATION: Preheat the oven to 350F. Cut the chicken into pieces.
Blend the paprika and pepper with the flour. Beat the egg white with
the milk. Dip the chicken into the egg white mixture and then into
the seasoned flour. Lay the chicken in a baking pan and bake for 30
minutes, or until golden brown. While the chicken is baking, make the
Country Rice. MAKE THE FRICASSEE GRAVY: Put the "roux" into a
saucepan and blend in the water a little at a time so there are no
lumps and the sauce is smooth. Add all remaining ingredients, cover
and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the
oven and add it to the pot with the Fricassee gravy. Let all simmer
for another 15 minutes, or until the hicken is very tender and easily
comes off the bones. TO SERVE: Spoon the Chicken Fricassee onto
plates and accompany with the Country Rice. NOTES: The chicken is
even good served just out of the oven without the Fricassee gravy.
Tastes like fried! There are few dishes that appeal to me more than a
good Chicken fricassee. This dish is one of my favorites in this
book. VARIATION: The skinned chicken breasts you buy at the grocery,
or skinless turkey breasts cut into strips, both make an excellent
Fricassee. Suggested Menu: Green Salad with Creamy Creole Dressing
