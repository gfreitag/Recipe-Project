Title: CHICKEN BREASTS WITH YOGHURT & FETA
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Skinless, boneless chicken
-breasts
8 oz Plain, non-fat yoghurt
3    Cloves garlic, minced
1 ts Dried oregano
ds Salt & pepper
4 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
Chopped fresh dill
Kalamata olives
In a medium bowl, mix together the yoghurt, garlic, oregano, salt, &
pepper. Reserve a small amount (~1/4 C.) to serve with the chicken.
Add the chicken breasts to the bowl with the yoghurt mixture, turning
to coat, and allow to marinate for 20-30 minutes. Grill or broil the
chicken breasts for a few minutes on each side, sprinkling them with
the crumbled feta after turning them the first time. Garnish with
chopped dill and olives and serve with the reserved sauce.

I always double the recipe - the chicken is great cold or in a
sandwich.

Enjoy, Melissa
