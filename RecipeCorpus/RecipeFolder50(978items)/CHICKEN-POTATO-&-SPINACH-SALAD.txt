mixture. If using fresh tarragon, add it now. Slowly whisk in 3
tablespoons olive oil. Set the dressing aside.

TO PREPARE THE POTATO SALAD: Cut unpeeled potatoes into 1-inch pieces.
Place in a pot, cover with water and place over high heat on the
stove and cook until potatoes are soft. Drain potatoes, place in a
mixing bowl, pour over the vinegar, cover and let sit for 5 minutes.

cooked chicken. Scrape the chicken into the bowl with the dressing,
add the potatoes and mix well. To serve, add spinach to the bowl, mix
well and mound on plates.

This is a favorite at Trumps restaurant in Los Angeles. With protein,
starch and vegetable, it's a full meal.
