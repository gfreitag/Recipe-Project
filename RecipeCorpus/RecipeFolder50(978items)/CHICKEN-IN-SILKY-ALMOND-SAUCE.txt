Pat  chicken dry.   Heat smaller amount of oil in heavy large skillet
or Dutch  oven over medium high heat. Add chicken in batches and cook
on all sides just until no longer pink (do not brown). Remove using
slotted spoon and set aside. Heat remaining oil in skillet. Add
sliced onion and fry until  wilted and pale brown,  stirring
constantly to color evenly, about 12 minutes. Stir in almonds,
coriander, ginger, cardamom, ground red pepper, cumin and fennel and
cook 3 to 5 more minutes. Remove mixture from heat. Transfer half of
mixture to processor or blender. Puree with 1/2 of the yogurt and 1/2
of the water. Repeat with the rest of the mixture, yogurt  and
water.   Pour  sauce back into skillet. Add chicken to skillet.
Place over medium high head and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover
and simmer until chicken is tender and sauce is thickened, about 45
minutes.   Remove from head.
Let stand at room temperature for  30 minutes  (dish is best
refrigerated and reheated).    Rewarm  over low heat. Transfer to
serving dish, garnish and serve immediately.
