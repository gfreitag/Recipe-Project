Title: CHICKEN ITALIANO
Categories: Poultry, Low-cal
Yield: 4 Servings
14 oz Tomatoes, canned
1/2 ts Basil, dried
1/2 ts Tarragon
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper, freshly ground
2 ts Butter, oil or marjarine
1    Garlic clove finely chopped
2 lb Chicken pieces, skinned
2 tb Parsley chopped or 2 tsp dry
1/2 c  Mozzarella cheese, shredded
Original recipe calls for chicken breast with bones. Because of the
sauce, it is easier to eat with bones removed. A good dish to make
with a whole utility frying chicken. Bones and skin can be cooked up
in a separate pot for stock.

Pour tomatoes into container of a blender or food processor. Add
basil, tarragon, salt and papper. Puree until smooth. Melt margarine
in a large frypan. Saute garlic over medium heat 1 min. (or mix in
1/2 tsp garlic powder with other spices)

Add chicken pieces, saute, turning once or twice until golden on both
sides.  Cover with tomato mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer 15 min until tender. Remove chicken and place in a warm
oven-proof dish. Stir parsley into sauce and spoon over chicken.
Sprinkle with Mozzarella. Place under heated broiler 1 min just until
cheese melts.

Or place on a microwave-safe dish and melt cheese in microwave. Or
sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese and serve immediately.
