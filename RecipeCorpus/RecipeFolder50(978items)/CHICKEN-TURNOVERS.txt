1. Prepare Dough: Stir together flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in
large bowl. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter and
vegetable shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in
yogurt, mixing just until mixture comes together. Divide dough in
half, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or
overnight. 2. Prepare Filling: Saute' shallots in oil in large
skillet over low heat, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add
mushrooms and sweet red pepper; cover and cook 5 to 7 minutes over
low heat or until mushrooms have given off their liquid and peppers
are soft. Stir in flour, paprika, salt and pepper; cook 2 minutes.
Stir in yogurt and chicken. Cool to room temperature. 3. Preheat oven
(400 degrees). Grease 1 large or 2 small baking sheets. 4. Working
with half the dough at a time, roll out one 12 x 12-inch square. Cut
in half diagonally into 2 triangles, then in half again to form 4
triangles. Place triangles on prepared baking sheet. Top each
triangle with one-fourth of the filling, leaving a 1/2-inch border
all around. Brush border with water. Roll out remaining dough to 12 x
12-inch square. Cut into 4 triangles as with first piece. Place one
triangle on top of each triangle on baking sheet. Seal edges with
fingers. Prick tops of turnovers several times with fork. 5. Bake for
25 minutes or until crisp and golden brown.

Hints:: Dough can be made several days ahead, wrapped and
refrigerated. The unbaked turnovers can be frozen, and then baked in
a pre-heated 375 oven for 5 to 10 minutes longer than in Step 5.

To speed up preparation, use a store-bought refrigerator crescent
dough and form it into turnovers. For appetizer portions, make
smaller turnovers. Also delicious using leftover cooked turkey, beef,
or pork. Makes 4 main-dish turnovers. Recipe can be halved or
doubled. Typos by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com> Source: The
