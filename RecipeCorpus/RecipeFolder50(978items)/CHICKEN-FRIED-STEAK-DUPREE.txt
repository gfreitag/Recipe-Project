Categories: Beef, Dupree
2/3 c  flour
Yield: 7 Servings
1 ts salt
Freshly ground black pepper
:
2 lb top round or chuck steak --
cut 3 to 2 inch
thick
:
:
2    eggs
2 TB cream
1/2 c  vegetable oil
2 c  saltine cracker crumbs --
rolled fine
:
1    onion -- sliced
1/2 c  cream
2 c  chicken broth
1 ds Worcestershire sauce --
optional
:
1 ds Hot Sauce -- optional

Mix 1/2 cup of the flour, the salt, and pepper together. Pound the
mixture into both sides of the meat with the edge of a heavy plate or
mallet. Cut the meat into serving pieces. Beat eggs together with the
cream. Heat the oil in a heavy cast iron skillet over moderately high
heat. Reserve 3 tablespoons of the flour. Dredge the steaks in the
remainder of the flour, dip in the egg mixture, and then into the
cracker crumbs. Place the steaks in the hot oil and brown well. Turn
and brown other side. Reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet, and
cook for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the steaks are
cooked through and tender. Chicken fried steak should be well done,
but not dry. Remove the steaks from the skillet and drain on brown
paper bags. Keep warm. Add the onion slices to the pan and saute
quickly. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat in the skillet and
stir in the 3 tablespoons reserved flour. Stir to incorporate any
particles on the bottom of the pan and! ! cook for 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in the cream, then the chicken broth. Season the gravy with
Worcestershire and hot sauce. Slice the meat across the grain and top
with the gravy. Yield: 6 to 8 servings
