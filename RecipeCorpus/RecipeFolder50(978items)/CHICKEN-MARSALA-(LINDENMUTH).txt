Title: CHICKEN MARSALA (LINDENMUTH)
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Boneless Chicken Breasts
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2 tb Flour
3 tb Butter
1/2 c  Dry Marsala Wine
1/2 c  Water
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; roll in flour. Over medium-high
heat, melt butter.  Cook chicken until golden on both sides. Remove
chicken.  Reduce heat to low. Stir wine and water into drippings,
scraping to loosen any brown bits.  Return chicken to skillet. Cover,
simmer about 30 minutes.

I usually make a little more sauce and personally like to increase
the wine over water mixture a bit.
