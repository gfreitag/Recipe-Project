HERBS:  1 to 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh herbs, such as thyme
or parsley. To Roast Peppers: Place the peppers on the grill or under
the broiler, turning them, until charred all over, nearly black.
Remove and place in a plastic bag to steam off skin. When cool enough
to handle, remove charred skin and seed them.

Preheat the grill or broiler. Halve the eggplant, score in 2 or 3
places, and brush with some of the oil. Place on the grill, cut side
towards the heat. Turn after 5 minutes. Cookuntil almost soft. Add
the chicken breasts and cook 3 minutes on each side, until done.
Remove to a plate. Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan until
singing. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until soft. Puree the
peppers and vinegar in a food processor or blender until smooth. Add
the puree, eggplants, and chicken to the frying pan, and heat
together, about 5 minutes. Place the chicken mixture on a platter
surrounded by the eggplant and sauce. Sprinkle with the herbs.  See
