~----------------- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place all the
ingredients in a deep, heavy pot that can be covered. Combine
everything very well with your hands. Seal the pot very tightly with
foil. Place a cover over the foil.  Pot must be very well sealed so
that no juices or steam can escape. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Do not open
the pot during this time. Serve piping hot, with good crusty bread
for mopping up the juices and garlic. Open the pot at the table, so
that the diners may get the full benefit of the marvelous fragrance
that explodes out of the vessel.
