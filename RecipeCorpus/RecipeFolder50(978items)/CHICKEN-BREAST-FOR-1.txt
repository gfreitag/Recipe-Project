Title: CHICKEN BREAST FOR 1
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 ea Chicken breast
1/4 c  Uncooked converted rice
1 c  Frozen mixed vegatables
1/2 cn Cream-of-whatever soup
1 c  Water
Chicken breast to be with bone but no skin. Completely line a small
baking pan (I use a 7 x 11 x 1.5 inch) with aluminum foil, letting
the foil line even the sides. Place another, double layer of foil in
the bottom of the pan.  Place chicken tit (thats half a chicken
breast for you married types out there) on one side of the pan. Pour
rice on the other half, then pour frozen veggies on top of rice.
Spoon dollops of soup on chicken and veggies, then pour a layer of
water over all (3/4 cup should do it). Cover pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour. Uncover...well look
at that...you have chicken, rice, and vegatables in a nice sauce.
Transfer to plate. Eat. Lift out foil lining and throw away. You're
done!
