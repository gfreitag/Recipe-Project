Scald the milk in a saucepan.  Pour over the shortening, sugar and salt in
a large mixing bowl.  Cool to lukewarm.  Sprinkle the yeast over the
lukewarm water and stir to dissolve.  Add the yeast mixture, 3 cups of the
flour, and eggs to the milk mixture. Beat, using an electric mixer set on
medium speed, for about 2 minutes. Gradually stir in enough of the
remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn the dough out on a lightly
floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top and
cover.  Let rise in a warm place until double, about 1 hour. Punch the
dough down and divide the dough into thirds, then let the dough rest for 10
minutes.  Divide each third into 12 pieces and shape each piece into a
ball.  Place 12 balls, equally spaced, in a greased 9-inch round cake pan.
Repeat for the remaining two thirds. Cover and let rise until doubled, 45
to 60 minutes. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes
or until golden brown. Remove from the pans and cool on wire racks.
