-----------------------------------OMELET-----------------------------------
1 sm Avocado (preferably

Chopped in half-inch cubes.
1/2 c  Coarsely grated Monterey
Jack (about 2 oz)
4 lg Eggs
2 tb Water
1 tb Unsalted butter
3    Slices of lean bacon,
Cooked and crumbled
In a small bowl stir together the tomato, the onion, the jalapeno,
the coriander, the lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste until the salsa
is combined well.  In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the water, and salt
and pepper to taste.

In an 8-inch skillet, preferably non-stick, heat 1/2 teaspoon of the
butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, pour in half the
egg mixture, tilting the skillet to spread the egg mixture evenly over the
bottom, and cook it for 1 minute, or until it is almost set. Sprinkle half
the omelet with half the bacon, half the avocado, peeled and cut into 1/2
inch pieces, and half the Monterey Jack and cook the Omelet for 1 minute,
or until it is set.  Fold the omelet over the filling, transfer it to a
plate, and keep it warm.  Make another omelet in the same manner with the
remaining butter, egg mixture, bacon, avocado, and Monterey Jack and serve
the omelets with the salsa over. Serves 2. (or 3 if you have enough other
things in the breakfast.) David Oesterreich Indianapolis, IN
