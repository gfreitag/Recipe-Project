Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Vodka
3 tb Chicken broth
1 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Salt
1 tb Cornstarch
2 c  Oil, for deep-frying
Lettuce leaves

Devein the shrimp.  Chop the shrimp very finely, almost into a paste. Mince
the ginger and garlic; keep them separate.  Peel the tough strings from the
celery stock; slice it at angle into pieces about 1/4-inch thick.

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, vodka, chicken broth,
and 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch.  Reserve this mixture.

In another mixing bowl, combine the shrimp with half of the minced ginger
and half of the minced garlic; add the salt and the remaining tablespoon of
cornstarch.  Mix well, and with lightly moistened hands form this mixture
into balls about 1-inch in diameter.

Heat the oil to 350 degree F and deep-fry the shrimp balls 6 at a time.
Drain the balls on paper towels and them keep warm. Put 1 tablespoon of the
hot oil from the deep-fry pan in a wok and stir-fry the remaining ginger
and garlic until it turns golden; add the celery and stir-fry quickly for
about for about a half a minute. Add the reserved sauce mixture and stir
until it thickens.

On a plate, make a bed of lettuce leaves and arrange the shrimp balls on
it, pour the sauce over the shrimp balls and serve hot. Makes 6 to 8
appetizer servings. Recipe: "Chinese Appetizers" by Verdi
