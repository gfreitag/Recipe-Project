Title: Tomato Sauce
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 servings
(optional - only if you
Like it)
1/4 c  Best olive oil
8 oz Contadina tomato sauce
6 oz Can Contadina tomato paste
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Dried oregano
Minced fresh basil, to
Taste (hard to have too
Much basil)
1 lg Can tomatoes (cheapest is
Best here, since they're
Soupy to start with)
2    Dead-ripe, peeled, fresh
Tomatoes (optional - if
They're in season, else
Don't bother)
1    Onion, chopped
2 cl Garlic, minced
1 sm Bell pepper, red or green
Heat the olive oil in a large pot, and saute the onions and green pepper
until soft.  Add the garlic and saute another minute or two.  Coarsely chop
the fresh tomatoes, add them to the pot and cook, stirring, until they
begin to give up their juice.  Coarsely chop the canned tomatoes and add
them, along with the tomato sauce and tomato past.  Stir in the seasonings,
cover the pot and simmer the sauce over low heat 20 to 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

The Contadina tomato sauce and paste have significantly better flavor than
any others I know of.  If you can't get Contadina, then a small shake of
tobasco will help (not enough to make it hot, just enough to give it a
little sparkle).

For all those people who THINK they can't make a pie crust, here is a
quick, easy, and CHEAP pie crust recipe.  I think the trick is the boiling
water and fluffing the shortening with a fork so that it disperses evenly
throughout the flour.
