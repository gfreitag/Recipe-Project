Title: Basic Pizza Dough
Categories: Pizza, Breads
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Oil
2 1/2 c  Flour (may need more to make
-the dough easy to work)
1 c  Luke warm water
1 pk Yeast
1 ts Salt (or garlic salt if you
-wish)
Mix water yeast and sugar in a bowl and let stand for 1-2 min. Add
remaining ingredients and knead the dough for 5-10 min. until elastic. When
making the pizza I have found that a pizza stone works best for maintaining
a crispy bottom crust. If you don't have a pizza stone try greasing your
pan and then dust it with corn meal. Bake the crust by itself (no toppings)
for about 10 min. Then top and finish baking.
