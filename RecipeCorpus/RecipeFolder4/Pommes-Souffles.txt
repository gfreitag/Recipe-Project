Vegetable oil for deep fryin
Peel and trim potatoes to an even oval shape.  Using a mandoline, cut the
potatoes lengthwise, on the narrow side, into long, narrow, even oval
slices, slightly less than 1/8-inch thick.  Pat dry on paper towels.

Half fill 2 large saucepans with oil.  Heat the first to 350f on a deep fat
thermometer.  Heat the second pan of oil to 400f.

Drop several potato slices into the first pan.  Remove from heat and shake
to keep potatoes from sticking together.  When the oil temperature drops to
300f, remove the potatoes with a skimmer and plunge them into the second
pan. (The potatoes will puff and bob around on top of the oil.) Turn the
puffs constantly until well browned on all sides. Transfer the potatoes to
paper towels to drain.

Bring both pans of oil back to specified temperatures, then repeat until
all potatoes are cooked.

Sprinkle with salt and keep warm until ready to serve.
