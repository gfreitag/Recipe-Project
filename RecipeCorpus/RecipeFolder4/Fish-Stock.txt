Fish stock is simmered longer than court bouillon, but rarely for more than
20 minutes.  Most chefs feel that a longer cooking time makes the stock
bitter.

Place all the ingredients in a large heavy kettle and simmer over low heat
for 20 minutes, skimming if you wish.

Strain through a cheesecloth lined strainer.

Yield:  About 5 cups
