Title: Grasshopper Pie
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Green creme de menthe
1/4 c  White creme de cacao
4 lg Egg yolks
Garnish:
Mint flavored chocolate, gra
-ed
Crust:
1 1/2 c  Chocolate wafer crumbs, fine
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
Filling:
1 1/2 ts Unflavored gelatin
1 1/3 c  Heavy cream, well chilled
In a bowl, stir together the wafer crumbs, sugar, and butter until the
mixture is combined well.  Pat mixture onto bottom and sides of a buttered
9-inch pie plate.  Bake in the middle of a preheated 450f oven for 5
minutes.  Let cool completely.

In a metal bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/3 cup of the cream and let it
soften for 5 minutes.  Whisk in the sugar, creme de menthe, creme de cacao,
and the egg yolks.  Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and
cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it measures 160f on a candy
thermometer.  Transfer the custard to an ice water bath and stir until it
is cooled and thickened.  In another bowl, beat the remaining cream until
it holds stiff peaks.  Fold it into the custard thoroughly.

Pour the filling into the crust and chill the pie for at least 4 hours or
until it is set.  Sprinkle with grated chocolate and serve.
