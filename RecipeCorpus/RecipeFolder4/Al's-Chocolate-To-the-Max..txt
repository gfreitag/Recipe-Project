Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Almond extract
1 tb Creme de cacao liqueur
1 c  Whipping cream
6 oz Package of semisweet
Chocolate chips
1    Egg

Blend together first 4 ingredients while microwaving the cream until just
beginning to boil. With blender going add the hot cream and blend until
well combined. Pour into small sherbet or wine glasses (I use the
disposable plastic ones) and refrigerate for several hours. This is
chocolate to the MAX! Few people refuse one of these and few can eat more
