Any Wonderful Pastry for 8" or 9" pie shell

pastry; trim edge even with pie plate. From pastry trimmings, cut out
dime-size circles; moisten each circle; overlap circles around rim of pie
plate, pressing down as you go.

In double-boiler top, cream together brown sugar and butter; stir in
granulated sugar, eggs, salt, corn syrup, and cream. Cook over hot, not
boiling, water 5 min., stirring constantly. Remove from heat; stir in
broken nuts and vanilla. Pour into lined pie plate. Bake at 350ø F. 50 min.
Arrange walnut balves around top. Bake 15 min. longer. Cool on wire rack.
(For toasty nuts, bake pie 15 min.; then arrange nuts on top of pie, and
bake 50 min.)

To Serve: This pie is delicious as is, but if desired, you may top each
wedge with small ball of vanilla ice cream or small mound of whipped cream.

PECAN PIE: Substitute pecans for walnuts.

PEANUT PIE: Substitute salted peanuts for broken walnuts. Bake 1 hr. 5
min., omitting extra nuts on top. Serve topped with small mounds of whipped
cream and a few peanuts.
