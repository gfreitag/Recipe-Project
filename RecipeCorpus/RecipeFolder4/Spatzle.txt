This cross between noodles and dumplings was brought to the United States
by immigrants from Austria and Hungary.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine flour, 1 teaspoon salt and farina.  Blend
in eggs and enough water to make a thick stiff dough. Bring a pot of water
to a boil and add remaining salt to it. Turn dough onto a board. Cut into
almond-sized pieces.  Drop into boiling water to make dumplings.  Or, press
through a spatzle maker into boiling water.  After dumplings rise, cook 1
to 2 minutes longer. Remove from water with a slotted spoon. Turn into a
warm serving dish. Toss with melted butter. Makes 4 servings.
