If dry milk is used, this may be added with the dry ingredients, and very
hot tap water used for water and milk.) Add liquids to dry ingredients.

Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer.  Add about 1/2 cup flour,
or enough to make a thick batter.  Beat at high speed for 2 minutes,
scraping bowl occasionally.  Add enough of remaining flour to make a soft
dough.  Mix throroughly.  Turn dough out on lightly floured pastry cloth or
board.  Knead until smooth and satiny.

Place dough in lightly greased bowl.  Cover and let rise in a warm place
(80-90 degrees) until doubled (about 1 hour).  Punch down and let rise
again until doubled (about 30 minutes).  Punch down. Let rest on pastry
cloth or board for 5 minutes.

Divide dough in half and shape into loaves.  Place in 2 greased 8 1/2 X 4
1/2 X 2 1/2 inch loaf pans.  Cover and let rise until doubled (30 minutes).
Bake in oven at 375 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes. Cool on rack.
