Here is a rich, delicious sauce for special occasions. Serve it with
grilled steak or roast beef for a really elegant dining experience. Ask
your butcher for the marrow; its rich flavor is indispensable to the
recipe. This sauce can be prepared up to two days in advance. Before
serving, rewarm over low heat until very hot.

Place the shallots, wine, salt and pepper, and thyme in a small saucepan
and bring to a boil.  Continue to boil until the liquid is reduced by one
half.  Remove from the heat and strain through a sieve.

Melt 1 Tbls of the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the
flour, turn down the heat to low, and cook until browned, about 2 minutes.
Then pour in the stock and continue to simmer over low heat for another 15
to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time. Stir in the reduced wine and
marrow and cook several minutes longer.  Remove from the heat, beat in the
remaining butter and stir in the parsley. Check and correct the seasonings,
if necessary and serve very hot.

Yield:  About 1 cup.
