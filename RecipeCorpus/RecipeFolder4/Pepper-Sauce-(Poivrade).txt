This easy version of the classic pepper sauce clearly illustrates why some
old-time combinations just cannot be improved upon. Serve this with beef or
game, especially pheasant. This sauce will also keep for two days in the
refrigerator.  Rewarm over low heat before serving.

Saute the bacon in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat for 2 minutes.
Add the onions, carrots, shallots, and leek and cook until well browned,
about 12 to 15 minutes.Stir in the vinegar and simmer over low heat until
the liquid has evaporated, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Whisk in the flour and
cook one minute more.  Then add the garlic, wine, bouquet garni and stock.
Simmer over low heat for one hour. Stir in the cracked peppercorns and salt
then simmer for 10 minutes more.  strain through a sieve lined with a layer
of cheesecloth.  Return to the saucepan and add the brandy. Simmer 3
minutes over low heat and serve hot.

Yield:  About 2 1/2 Cups of sauce.
