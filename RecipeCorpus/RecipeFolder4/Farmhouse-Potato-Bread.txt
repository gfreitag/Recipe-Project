flour.  Knead dough on generously floured surface until smooth and elastic,
adding more flour if stick, about 10 minutes. Grease large bowl with 2 Tbs
butter.l Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover bowl with towel.
Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2
hours.

Punch dough down.  Knead until smooth, about 1 minute.  Return to bowl.
Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.

Butter two 6-cup loaf pans, using remaining 2 Tbs butter.  Punch dough
down.  Cut into 2 pieces.  Shape each piece into loaf; transfer to prepared
pans.  Cover pans with towel.  Let dough rise until level with tops of
pans, about 45 minutes.

Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 400 F.  Place bread in
oven.  Reduce temperature to 375 F.  Bake until loaves are rich golden
brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes. Cool in pans 5
minutes.  Transfer to racks and cool completely before serving.
