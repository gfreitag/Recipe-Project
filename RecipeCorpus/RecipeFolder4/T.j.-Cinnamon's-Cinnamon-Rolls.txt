the salt.  At low speed gradually beat in milk, oil, eggs and yeast
mixture; beat until well blended.  Beat in additional flour (about 1 1/2
cups) until dough pulls away from the sides of bowl. On floured surface
knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Place in a greased
bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm, draftfree place
until doubled in bulk, 1 hour.

two 9 inch round cake pans. On lightly floured surface roll dough into an
18x10" rectangle.  Spread with filling.  Roll tightly from long side. Cut
into fourteen 1 1/4 inch slices.  Place 1 roll cut side up in center of
each pan.  Arrange remaining rolls in a circle of 6 around the center roll.
Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, 30 to 40 minutes.

Cool in pans 10 minutes.  Invert onto wire racks, then invert again to

cooled rolls.  (Can be made ahead.  Wrap well and freeze up to 1 month.
