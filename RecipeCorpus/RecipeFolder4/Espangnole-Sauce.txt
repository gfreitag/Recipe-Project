The Spanish in this sauce comes from the addition of sherry. The aromatic
brown sauce goes very well with roast beef, ham, or pork and even tastes
wonderful over baked potatoes. You can substitute Maderia for the sherry if
you'd like a slightly sweeter sauce.

Place the brown sauce in a medium-size saucepan and reduce over low heat by
one third, about 15 minutes or more. Stir in the extract and simmer an
additional 15 minutes. Add the sherry and cook gently for 5 minutes longer.
Serve immediately.

Yield:  About 2 cups of sauce.
