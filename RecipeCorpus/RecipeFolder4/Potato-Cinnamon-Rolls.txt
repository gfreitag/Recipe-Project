Ingredients
...........
1 lb Potatoes, boiled and mashed
2 c  Milk
1 c  Butter
1 c  Plus 2 tsps sugar
3/4 ts Cardamon seed

Mix potatoes and milk until smooth.  Add 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar and
salt.  Heat to lukewarm (about 11 O deg). In a large bowl combine yeast,
water and remaining 2 tsps sugar. Let stand until foaming (about 10
minutes).  Add potato mix, 4 cups flour, eggs and vanilla.  Beat until
smooth. Gradually stir in additional 3 1/2 to 4 cups flour.  Turn dough on
heavily floured board and knead until smooth and elastic (15 minutes).  Add
more flour if needed.  Let rise 1 1/2 hours.  Punch down, kneed to remove
bubbles.  Divide.  Melt remaining butter.  Roll each portion of dough to a
5x18 rectangle.  Brush with 3 tsps of butter and sprinkle with half of the
cinnamon filling.  Roll up.  Cut in 12 pieces, 1 1/2" wide.  Place in a
9x13" pan, brush with butter and let rise 35-40 minutes.  Bake at 350
degrees 30 minutes.
