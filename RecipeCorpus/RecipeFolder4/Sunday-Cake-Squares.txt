This is a large cake recipe that was developed on the farm for haying time.
It makes 48 servings, so this would be a good recipe for parties,
especially kid's parties.

Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg together and set aside.

Cream the sugar and shortening together, in a large mixing bowl, until
light and fluffy, using an electric mixer set ad medium speed. Add the
eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in the vanilla
extract.

Add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk, beating well after each
addition, using the mixer set at low speed.  Spread the batter in two 13 X
9 X 2-inch baking pans.

Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon, blending well, and sprinkle over the
cake batter.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 15 minutes or until the cake
tests done.  Cool in the pans on wire racks.  Cut each pan into 24
servings.
