Apples and buttons, this best-known of all Pennsylvania Dutch dishes is
called. Truly a meal in itself, it contains proteins, starch and
carbohydrates in a giant slab of ham surrounded by raised dumplings and
stewed apples.

To prepare, add apples and their liquid to ham and boil for one hour. If
dried apples are used, they should be soaked overnight first. Add brown
sugar. Prepare dumplings by sifting together flour, baking powder, salt and
pepper. Stir in well-beaten egg, butter and enough milk to make a stiff but
moist batter. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into main dish, cover tightly
and steam for about 20 minutes. Frozen oven-ready yeast biscuits may be
substituted for the dumpling batter.
