2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
3    To 3 1/2 cups sifted flour

In a large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast.  Heat

mixing at high speed for 3 minutes.  Stir in as much remaining flour as you
can until dough pulls cleanly away from sides of bowl.

On floured surface, knead about 2 minutes.  Roll dough into a 15x7"
rectangle.  Melt chocolate chips and 2 Tbsp. butter together; cool and
spread over rectangle.  Sprinkle with pecans.  Starting with long side,
roll dough up jelly-roll fashion.  Cut into 12 slices.

dough slices on top.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a towel. Let rise
in warm place until nearly double (35 to 40 minutes).  Bake at 375 degrees
