1 c  Sugar
8    To 9 cups sifted all-purpose

2 tb (1/4 stick) butter, melted

Makes 2 loaves

Crumble yeast cakes into large bowl.  Stir in water.  Let mixture stand
until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Scald milk.  Add butter and salt and stir until butter melts. Cool to
lukewarm.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs until frothy.  Add sugar and beat until
creamy, about 3 minutes.  Blend in milk mixture.  Stir into yeast mixture.
Stir in 7 cups flour 1 cup at a time; dough should be soft and pull away
from sides of bowl.  Turn dough out onto well-floured surface, sprinkle
with 1 cup flour and knead until smooth and elastic, adding up to 1 cup
more flour as necessary to prevent stickiness, about 10 minutes.

Grease large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover and
let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Punch dough down.  Let rest 10 minutes.  Grease two 9-inch round cake pans.
Divide dough in half.  Press each half into pan. Cover and let rise in warm
draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Bake until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow
when tapped on bottom, about 30 minutes.  Brush tops immediately with
melted butter.  Serve warm.
