Cut the marrow crosswise into slices,1/2" thick.Put the pieces in a bowl
and add cold water to cover.Set aside for 10 minutes or longer Sprinkle the
meat on both sides with salt and pepper.Heat the oil in a heavy skillet
large enough to hold both steaks.Add the steaks and cook about 10 minutes
or until thoroughly browned and  scared on one side.Turn and continue
cooking until  thoroughly  browned and scared, about 5 minutes.Cook about 5
minutes longer,turning meat occasionally. Transfer the steaks to a warm
platter and pour off all fat from the skillet.Add 1 tbsp. of butter to the
skillet.When it melts,add the shallots,wine,vinegar and sugar.Cook over
relatively high heat until the liquid is almost completely reduced,about 12
minutes.Add the broth and any juices that may have accumulated around the
steaks.Cook about 3 minutes and swirl in the remaining 4 tbsp. of butter.
Meanwhile,drain the pieces of marrow and put them in a saucepan.Add cold
water to cover and salt to taste.Bring to a simmer but do not boil.Cook as
briefly as possible,only until the marrow is barely heated.If the marrow
cooks longer,it will turn into liquid fat.Using a slotted spoon,transfer
the marrow pieces to the sauce.Slice the steaks and serve with the marrow
sauce on the side.Makes 4 servings.
