Categories: Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
1 qt Raspberry ice (sorbet)
Fudge Sauce (see below)
Whipping cream, whipped
(optional)
16 oz Chocolate wafers
10 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1 qt Frozen yogurt, vanilla
-flavored
--------------------------------FUDGE SAUCE--------------------------------
4 tb Light corn syrup
4 tb (1/2 stk)
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 c  Milk
In a food processor, process the chocolate wafers into crumbs.  Add the
melted butter; combine. Press the crumb mixture into 9-inch round, 3-inch
deep springform pan, reserving 1-1/2 cups of the crumb mixture.

Bake in a preheated, 325 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove and
allow to cool.

When the crust is cool, fill with the frozen yogurt.  Sprinkle with half of
the reserved crumb mixture.  Dribble half the fudge sauce over the crumb
layer, then place in the freezer so the yogurt won't melt.

After 5 minutes, make a second layer with the raspberry ice.  Sprinkle the
remaining crumb mixture on top.  Put in freezer immediantly.

Serve with the remaining fudge sauce and whipped cream, if desired.

TO MAKE THE FUDGE SAUCE:  In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, cocoa
powder, milk, corn syrup, and butter.  Bring to a boil and let boil 2 to 3
minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Whisk in vanilla extract. Recipe: Post Oak
