Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Cranberry juice
Sugar to taste
1    18-ounce jar or can
Cherries
1    Envelope gelatin
To be served with cold chicken, turkey, or duck.

Drain the cherries, add their juice to the cold cranberry juice and
sprinkle the gelatin over.  Heat until almost simmering.  Remove from heat,
stir in the gelatin until it is thoroughly dissolved, and then add sugar,
if needed.  Pour into a 4-cup mold and cool.  Pit the cherries, if
necessary.  When the liquid is about the consistency of egg whites, spoon
in the cherries and chill until set.  Serve garnished with watercress and
cream cheese balls.
