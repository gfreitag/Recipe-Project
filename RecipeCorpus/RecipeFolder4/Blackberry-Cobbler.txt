2 tb Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Sugar

In a large bowl, stir together the cornstarch an 1/4 cup cold water until
cornstarch is completely dissolved.  Add 1 cup sugar, lemon juice, and
blackberries, and combine the mixture gently but thoroughly. Transfer to an
8-inch cast-iron skillet.

In a bowl, combine well the flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and

spoonfuls of the dough carefully onto the boiling mixture, and bake the
cobbler on a foil lined baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 400f oven
for 20-25 minutes or until the topping is golden. Serve warm with vanilla
ice cream.
