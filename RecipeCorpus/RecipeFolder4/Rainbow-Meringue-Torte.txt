Dazzling dessert! The airy meringue layers are foolproof with meringue mix
(and no leftover egg yolks)! Really easy, but it's a plan-ahead
make-ahead--

Toasted slivered blanched almonds

Meringue layers: Preheat oven to 400ø. Meanwhile prepare meringue mix
according to package directions for meringue shells. Cover 2 large or 4
small cooky sheets with foil (or brown paper). Draw four 8 1/2-inch circles
on foil (use cake pan as guide). Spoon equal amounts of meringue on the 4
circles; spread evenly. Place in hot oven (400ø). Close door quickly; turn
off oven heat. Leave in oven 3 hours or overnight, without opening door.
Remove meringues from foil.

To fill torte: Let ice cream soften slightly. Place a meringue layer on
serving plate; spoon chocolate ice cream atop and spread evenly (work
quickly); place in freezer. Spread second meringue with pistachio ice
cream; set atop first layer in freezer. Spread third meringue with
strawberry ice cream , set atop others. Frost remaining meringue with
whipped cream, and add. Freeze till ice cream is firm, about 5 hours or
overnight. Ten or 15 minutes before serving, remove from freezer; sprinkle
with toasted slivered almonds. To serve, cut with sharp knife. Makes 10
servings.
