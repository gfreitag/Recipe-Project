Fat grams    per serving:
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease 8" square pan. Mix brown sugar and butter
till well blended. Stir in Bisquick and walnuts till mixture is crumbly;
reserve 1 cup. Press remaining mixture in pan with fingers. Bake 12
minutes.   Mix cream cheese and granulated sugar; beat in remaining
ingredients till smooth. Spread cream cheese mixture over layer in pan;
sprinkle with crumbly mixture. Bake till centre is firm, about 25 minutes.

NB. Results aren't always consistent (sometimes it's too crumbly or the
bottom layer sticks in the pan). However, it's Dad's favorite recipe.
