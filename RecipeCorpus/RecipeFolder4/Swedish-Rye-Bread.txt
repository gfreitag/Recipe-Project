bread flour, stirring until smooth.  Mix in enough of remaining flour 1/2
cup at a time to form soft dough.  Knead on floured surface until dough is
no longer sticky, adding more flour if necessary, about 10 minutes.

Grease baking sheets.  Gently knead dough on lightly floured surface until

prepared sheets.  Cover with towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until
doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Bake until loaves sound hollow when tapped on
bottom, about 1 hour.  Immediately transfer to racks and cool completely.
