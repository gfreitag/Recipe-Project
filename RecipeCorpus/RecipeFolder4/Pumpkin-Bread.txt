Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F, and grease 3 medium (8 1/2 X 4 1/2) loaf
pans, sprinkling a little brown sugar in each. Combine all the dry
ingredients in a large bowl and fashion a well in the center. Break in the
4 eggs and add the salad oil, water and pumpkin. Beat thoroughly until well
mixed, then add the raisins and nuts.  Pour into the prepared pans. Bake 1
hour and 15 minutes or until a cake tester or wooden pick inserted in the
center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes in the pans before turning onto
wire racks to cool. NOTE: This bread can be wrapped in aluminum foil and
frozen very satisfactorily.
