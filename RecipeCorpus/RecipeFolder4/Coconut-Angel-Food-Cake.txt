1 1/4 c  Sugar
2 lg Egg whites
1 ts Orange zest, grated
1/4 c  Orange juice, strained
1 tb Corn syrup
1 c  Coconut, shredded and toaste
-   (unsweetened)
Cake:
3/4 c  Cake flour
8 lg Egg whites
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
1 c  Superfine sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Almond extract
1/2 c  Coconut, shredded (unsweeten
Onto a sheet of wax paper, sift the flour 3 times.  In a large bowl with an
electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the salt until they are frothy.
Add the cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks.  Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, a
little at a time.  Add the vanilla and almond extract, and beat the whites
to stiff peaks.  Fold in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time.
Sift the flour over the whites in 4 batches, folding it in gently after
each sifting.  Fold in the coconut.

Spoon batter into a 9-inch tube pan, 3 1/2-inches deep.  Bake in the middle
of a preheated 275f oven for 1 1/2 hours.

Hang the cake in the pan, upside down, on the neck of a bottle and let it
cool for 90-120 minutes or until cooled completely.  Release the cake with
a sharp knife, turn it out on a rack and invert it onto a cake plate.

In a metal bowl, whisk together the sugar, egg whites, zest, juice, corn
syrup, and a pinch of salt.  Set the bowl over simmering water, and cook,
whisking, until it registers 140f on a candy thermometer. Remove pan from
heat and whisk the mixture over the hot water for 3 minutes. Remove the
bowl from the water and, with an electric mixer, beat the frosting at high
speed for 7-10 minutes or until it is cool and holds stiff peaks.

Spread top and sides of the cake with the frosting and coat the outside
with the toasted coconut.
