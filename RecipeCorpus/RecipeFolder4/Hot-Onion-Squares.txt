Title: Hot Onion Squares
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Milk
1 lg Egg
3/4 c  Sour cream
2 c  Onion, very thinly sliced
7 tb Lard
Cayenne pepper to taste
2 c  Bread flour
1 tb Baking powder
In a heavy skillet, cook the onion in 2 Tbsp lard, over mod-low heat,
stirring, until it is golden.  Stir in the cayenne and salt and pepper to
taste.  Reserve the mixture.

Onto a sheet of wax paper, sift together the flour, baking powder, and
salt.  Sift the mixture again into a bowl.  Add the remaining lard, and
blend the mixture until it resembles fine meal.  Stir in the milk, stirring
until the dough is combined well.  Turn out onto a floured surface and
knead it for 30 seconds.  Pat into a 9-inch square, press it evenly into a
greased 9-inch baking pan and top with the onion mixture.

In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, sour cream, and salt and pepper to
taste.  Pour this over the onion mixture, using a spatula to cover the
onion mixture evenly.

Bake in the middle of a preheated 450f oven for 20-25 minutes or until it
is cooked through.  Cut into squares and serve hot.
