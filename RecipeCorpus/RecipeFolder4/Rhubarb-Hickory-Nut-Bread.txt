Title: Rhubarb-Hickory Nut Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 servings
1    Egg
2 tb Milk
4 tb Melted butter (1/2 stick)
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped hickory
-nuts
1 c  Coarsely chopped rhubarb
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
Let the rhubarb steep in 1/2 cup of the sugar for 1 hour or more (even
overnight) stirring once or twice.  Toss the remaining sugar and all of the
dry ingredients together to mix thoroughly.  Beat the egg lightly and stir
into it 1/4 cup of the juice that the rhubarb will have exuded after
steeping, as well as the milk and melted butter.  Mix the dry ingredients
into the wet, stirring just enough to mix.  Fold in the rhubarb (if there
is still more juice, drain it off) and the nuts. Scrape the batter into a
buttered 8-inch loaf pan and bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 1 hour. Let
the loaf rest in the pan 10 minutes before unmolding, then cool it on a
rack.

Makes one 8-inch loaf.
