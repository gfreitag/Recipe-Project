Servings: 18

In large bowl, combine sugar, salt, yeast and 1 cup flour. In 1 quart
saucepan over low heat, heat milk and 1/2 cup butter or margarine (1 stick)
until very warm (120-130'F). Butter or margarine does not need to melt.

With mixer at low speed, gradually beat liquid into dry ingredients just
until blended. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes. Beat in vanilla
extract, 1 egg, and 1 cup flour to make a thick batter; continue beating 2
minutes scraping bowl often. With wooden spoon, stir in 2 cups flour to
make a soft dough.

Turn dough onto floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about
10 minutes, working in more flour (about 1/3 cup). Shape into ball; place
in greased large bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place
(80-85'F) until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down dough. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; cut dough in
half; cover and let rest 15 minutes. Grease 2 large cookie sheets. In small
bowl, mix brown sugar, pecans, raisins, and cinnamon. In small saucepan
over low heat, melt 4 T butter or margarine (1/2 stick).

With floured rolling pin, roll half of dough into 17 1/2x12" rectangle.
Brush with half of melted butter; sprinkle with half of brown-sugar
mixture. From 17 1/2" edge, roll dough jelly-roll fashion; pinch seam to
seal. Cut roll into 9 wedges, 2 1/2 inches at wide side, 1 inch at short
side.

Turn wedges short side up. Press handle of wooden spoon across each. Repeat
with other half of dough.

Place rolls 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Cover; let rise in warm place
until doubled, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350'F. In cup, beat remaining egg; with pastry brush, brush
rolls. Bake rolls 20 minutes or until golden. Remove rolls from cookie
sheets; cool on wire racks.
