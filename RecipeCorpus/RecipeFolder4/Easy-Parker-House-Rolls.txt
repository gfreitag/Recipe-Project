Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Active Dry Yeast; Bulk
1/4 c  Lukewarm Water; 110 Deg. F.
4 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour

Servings:  4

Pour the scalded milk over the sugar, 2 tbls of butter and salt in a mixing
bowl.  Cool to lukewarm.  Sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm water and
stir to dissolve.  Add 2 cups of flour, and the yeast mixture to the milk
mixture.  Beat, with an electric mixer on medium speed, until smooth, about
2 minutes.  Gradually add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft
dough, then cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Knead the dough a few times
on a lightly floured surface until it is no longer sticky and roll out to a
1/2-inch thickness.  Cut into rounds, using a floured biscuit cutter. Brush
the rounds with the remaining 2 Tbls of melted butter and crease each roll
in the center with the dull edge of a knife. Fold the rolls over on the
crease and press the edges together lightly. Place on greased baking sheets
and cover.  Let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 30
minutes.  Bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 10 minutes or until
golden brown. Remove from the baking sheets and cool on wire racks.

NOTE:

These rolls are almost a must at the Holiday dinners coming up shortly.
Restaurants and most older cooks make it a tradition to serve them.
