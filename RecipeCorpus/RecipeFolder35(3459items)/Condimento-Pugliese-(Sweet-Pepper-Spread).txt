Title: Condimento Pugliese (Sweet Pepper Spread)
Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Salsa/sauce, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/8 ts Red pepper flakes
Salt & pepper, to taste
2 lg Red bell peppers, roasted
1 tb Olive oil
Roughly chop the roasted peppers.  Set them in a food processor & add
the remaining ingredients.  Pulse until you have a slightly chunky
mixture. Be careful not to puree the mixture otherwise it will be too
fine.

If you don't have a processor, finely dice the ingredients by hand &
mix them together.  Taste for seasonings & spread on crostini or use
a pasta sauce.
