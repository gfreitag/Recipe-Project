Title: Yukon Kolaches
Categories: Pastry, Route 66
Yield: 28 servings
1 ts Salt
1    Egg -- beaten
2    Egg Yolks -- beaten
7 c  Flour
1 tb Butter -- melted
1 1/4 c  Pastry Filling*
2 pk Dry Yeast
1/4 c  Warm Water (110-115 F)
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Butter Or Margarine
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Shortening
* poppy seeds, prunes, apricots, or fruit preserves.

Dissolve yeast in water; set aside. In medium saucepan heat the milk,
butter or margarine, sugar, shortening, and salt until warm (120-130
F), stirring constantly. Transfer to a very large mixing bowl. Stir
in the dissolved yeast, egg, and egg yolks. Gradually stir in 5 cups
of flour to make a soft sponge. Cover and let rise in a warm place
until the dough just starts to rise (about 20-30 mins). Stir in
remaining 2 cups flour to make a soft dough. Cover and let rise in a
warm place until double (about 45 mins). Stir dough down. Cover and
let rest 10 mins.

Turn out onto a floured surface and roll to 3/4 inch thickness. Cut
with a 3-inch round cutter. Place 3 inches apart on greased baking
sheets. Brush with melted butter or margarine. Cover and let rise
until nearly double (about 30 mins). Using a floured finger or back
of a spoon, make a depression in the center of each and fill with
about 2 tsp of the pastry filling. Bake in 375 F oven for 12-15 mins
or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheets and cool on wire
rack. Makes about 28 kolaches.
