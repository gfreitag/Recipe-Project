1. To make the curd, combine the eggs and sugar in a medium
nonreactive saucepan and whisk until thickened and light in color.
Whisk in the lemon zest and juice. Place over low heat and cook,
whisking constantly, until thick, about 10 mins. Do not boil. Remove
from the heat and whisk in the butter. Let cool. Refrigerate until
cold. 2. Meanwhile, make the crust: Combine the almonds, sugar, and
zest in a food processor and process until ground. Add the flour and
salt and pulse just to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the
mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk together the egg yolk, water,
and almond extract. Add to the flour mixture and process just until
the mixture starts to come together. Press into a ball, flatten into
a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 mins. 3. Preheat the
oven to 350 F. 4. Roll out the dough and fit it into a 10-inch quiche
dish. Line with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake
for 20 mins. Remove the foil and weights and bake until the crust is
lightly browned, about 5 mins longer. Let cool. 5. To make the
topping, turn the oven down to 300 F. Lightly butter a baking sheet.
Combine the sugar and zest in a bowl and set aside. Whisk the egg
whites until foamy, add the almonds and stir to coat. Drain the
almonds and toss with sugar. Spread out on the baking sheet and bake,
until the almonds are dried, about 30 mins. Let cool. 6. Spoon the
lemon curd into the pastry shell and top with the sugared almonds.
Keep refrigerated until ready to serve. Just before serving, sift a
little confectioners' sugar over the top and cut into wedges. Serves
