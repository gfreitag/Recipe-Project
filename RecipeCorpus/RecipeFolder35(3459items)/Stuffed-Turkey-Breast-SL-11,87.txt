Trim fat from turkey; remove tendons.  Place outer side of turkey
breast on heavy-duty plastic wrap with inside of breast facing up.
Starting from the center, slice horizontally through the thickest
part of each side of the breast almost to, but not through, the outer
edge. Flip cut piece over to enlarge breast.  Place heavy-duty
plastic wrap on turkey; pound to a more even thickness, using a
meat-mallet or rolling pin (place loose pieces of turkey over thinner
portions ). Set aside.
Coat a skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat
until hot.  Add onion and celery; saute until tender.  Remove from
heat. Add rice, applesauce, pecans, currants, parsley, salt, pepper,
cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon pie spice, and poultry seasoning; stir well.
Spread stuffing mixture in center of turkey breast within 2 inches of
sides; roll up turkey breast, jelly-roll fashion, starting with short
side, to approximately an 11" x 6" roll.  Secure at 2-inch intervals,
using heavy string. Place, seam side down, on a rack in a shallow
roasting pan coated with cooking spray.
Combine remaining ingredients in a small saucepan; cook over
medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until hot and bubbly.  Boil 1
minute; remove from heat.  Brush mixture over turkey roll.  Bake,
uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 2 hours, basting often with apple
juice mixture.
Transfer turkey roll to a serving platter.  Let stand 15 minutes;
remove string, and slice.  Spoon remaining apple juice mixture over
turkey. Yield: 12 servings.
