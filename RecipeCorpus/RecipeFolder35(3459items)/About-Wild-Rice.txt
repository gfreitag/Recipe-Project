Categories: Information, Pasta/rice, Amerindian
Yield: 1 text file  Proper name: Zizania aquatica L. [ member of the grass family:
Gramineae ]

Other names: Indian Rice, water rice, water oats and Tuscarora rice.

Substitutes and other wild edible grasses: manna grass, reed-grass,
rye grass, drop-seed grass, rice grass, slough grass and canary
reed-grass.

Range: From New Brunswick to Manitoba and around the Great Lakes
region of the U.S. along watercourses, marshes and lake-margins.

How to harvest: Gather in a boat or canoe; bend the fruiting heads
over the boat and shake sharply to dislodge the grains. To hull, heat
in a dry pot or skillet loosen hulls, beat or trample and then
winnow. Wash and dry.

How to cook: the flavor is rather nutty and has a great affinity for
mushrooms, almonds and other nuts. Otherwise prepare as for regular
rice allowing 3 cups of water for each cup of rice and 40-45 min to
cook.

It can also be dried and ground into meal for making porridges and
mushes, adding to flour for muffins, breads, cakes and thickening
soups.
