Categories: Pie/tart, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1    Box white cake mix
-favorite flavoring for
-fruit (cinnamon,
-almond,etc)
2 cn Fruit (peaches, cherries,
-pineapple, apricots)
1 cn Sweetened condensed milk (we
-used Eagle Brand)
First, start fire early so as to have plenty of hot coals. <grin>.
Actually an oven set at 350 F will do in a pinch.

Then line a 4-qt cast iron dutch oven with aluminum foil. If your
doing this on a bed of coals use the type of dutch oven that has feet
and a flat lid with a lip to hold the coals.

Mix fruit with about 1/2 Cup of the cake mix and choice of flavoring,
put in the dutch oven.  Mix the remaining cake mix and the can of
Eagle Brand milk together and pour over the fruit/cake mixture.

Put cover on, place on top of a bed of coals and place a heaping
shovelful of coals on top. Or put in oven. Cook for 45 min. to an
hour (check after 40 minutes)

=-=-=-=-=-VARIATIONS-=-=-=-=-= Mixtures of fruits are delicious;
cherry/pineapple, peaches/apricots, dark cherries/peaches. Anything
that suits your fancy.
