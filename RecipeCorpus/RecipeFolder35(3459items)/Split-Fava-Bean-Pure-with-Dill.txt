Title: Split Fava Bean Pure with Dill
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Lemon juice
1/4 ts Saffron threads, crushed
2 tb Soft butter
Salt and pepper to taste
2 lg Shallots, finely chopped
2 tb To 3 tbs heavy cream
1/3 c  Dill, coarsely chopped plus
1    Sprig dill
1 1/2 c  Split peeled fava beans
-soaked and drained
1 md Carrot
1 sm Stalk celery with leaves
1 sm Onion stuck with
1    Whole clove
2 lg Sprigs parsley
3    Sprigs thyme
To a 3-qt. saucepan, add beans, carrot, celery and onion. Tie parsley
and thyme together and add, along with enough warm water to cover by
about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer, with lid
slightly ajar, for 15-20 minutes or until the beans are very soft and
have begun to lose their shape.

Meanwhile, mix the lemon juice and saffron in a small cup and set
aside for 10 minutes.

When beans are done, lift out vegetables and herbs and discard them.
Drain beans well, discarding the liquid. Transfer beans to a
medium-size bowl and beat in 1 tbs of the butter with a wooden spoon
(Note: this is a coarse pure. If you prefer a smoother texture,
pure it in a food processor). Then stir in the saffron and lemon
juice, and add the salt and pepper.

In a small skillet, heat remaining butter and saut the shallots over
medium heat, stirring constantly for 2-3 minutes or until they are
translucent, but not brown. Add to the pure and beat in 2 tbs of the
cream (add 1 more tbs of cream if the texture is too dry), then stir
in the chopped dill. Taste for salt and pepper. Transfer to an
oven-to-table serving dish, cover with aluminum foil and keep warm in
a preheated low oven until ready to serve. Garnish with a sprig of
dill.
