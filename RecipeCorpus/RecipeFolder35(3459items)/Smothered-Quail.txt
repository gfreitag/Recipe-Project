Title: Smothered Quail
Categories: Game, Holiday, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Flour; all-purpose
2 1/2 c  Chicken broth; boiling
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
Juice from 1/2 a lemon
6    Quail; cleaned
Salt to taste
Black pepper to taste
5 tb Butter
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Sprinkle each quail inside and out with salt and pepper.

Heat the butter in a skillet, preferably of black cast iron, and
when it is quite hot, add the quail. Brown the birds on all sides,
turning occasionally to brown evenly, about 5 minutes.

Transfer the quail to a platter. Sprinkle the fat in the skillet
with flour. Cook, stirring, until the flour takes on a hazelnut color.
Add the broth, stirring rapidly with a wire whisk until the sauce
is thickened and smooth. Add the Worcestershire sauce and lemon
juice. Return the quail to the skillet and turn them in the sauce.
Cover with a tight-fitting lid. Place in the oven and bake 45 minutes
or longer, or until the quail are thoroughly tender.
