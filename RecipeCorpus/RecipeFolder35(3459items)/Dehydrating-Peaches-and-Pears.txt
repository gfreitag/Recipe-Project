Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
TO DRY PEACHES:  Wash and defuss with a terry towel (peeling is not
necessary)  Then cut into slices directly onto tray.  They may tend to
stick to the trays, but half way through, turn them over. Eat and
enjoy as is, or soak to reconstitute, and then serve with cream and a
little honey if desired.

PEACH LEATHER: Blend ripe, pitted peaches.  Sweeten with a bit of
honey if desired.  Add a touch of spices if you desire.  Dry as for
basic leather. Peaches by themselves have a delicious flavor, but
this leather can also be combined with apple chunks. TO DRY PEARS:
Once again, small pieces are the ruleof thumb.  Quarter the washed
fruit, do no peel, then slice thin for fast drying.  Keep the
temperature as usual, around 100F. It is unnecessary even to core
pears, since the whole fruit is deliciously edible when dreid. Your
willfind your delicate hued, beautifully translucent dried pears to
be an aesthtic pleasure as well. PEAR LEATHER: Nothing needs to be
added to pears when making leather. Perhaps a touch of spice if
desired. Follow instructions for basic leather. Origin: Dry It -
