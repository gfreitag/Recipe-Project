1/2 ts Sea Salt
3/4 c  (+ 2 Tbs) Skim Milk

Put the dough ingredients in the machine's bread pan and turn the
machine on the RISE setting. When the dough has risen, turn it onto a
lightly floured surface, and roll it into a 12 x 16-inch rectangle.
Cut it into 12 (4-inch) squares.

Mix the cream cheese with the sugar and put 1 level Tbs in the center
of a square; top with 1 level Tbs of blueberry filling. Fold to
overlap two opposite corners. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

Arrange the foldovers 2 inches apart on baking sheets coated with
cooking spray. Cover and let them rise in a warm place until doubled
in bulk; about 45 to 60 mins. Bake at 375 F for 10 to 12 mins, or
until light golden brown. This recipe makes 12 foldovers. Drizzle
them with a powdered sugar glaze, if desired.
