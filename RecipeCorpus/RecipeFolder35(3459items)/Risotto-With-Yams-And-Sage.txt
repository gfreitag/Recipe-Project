1. Combine the broth, yams, carrot, and celery in a large pot and
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until reduce to 10 cups,
about 30 mins. With a slotted spoon, remove 1 yam and cut it into
1/2-inch dice. Set aside. Remove the broth and remaining vegetables
fromthe heat, puree in a blender, and set aside to cool. 2. Preheat
the oven to 350 F. 3. Combine the olive oil, water, salt, and cayenne
in a bowl. Add the almonds and toss to coat. Spread the almonds on a
baking sheet and bake until golden, about 15 mins. Remove from the
sheet and set aside. This recipe can be prepared to this point up to
3 days before serving; refrigerate the broth and diced yam. 4. About
40 mins before serving, warm the yam broth over low heat and bring
the reserved yam to room temperature if necessary. Melt the butter in
a heavy pot over low heat. Add the onion, cover, and cook until soft,
about 5 mins, stirring to avoid browning. Add the rice  and stir
well. Ladle in 1/2 cup of the reserved yam broth and stir. Increase
heat to medium-high and for the next half hour, continue ladling in
the broth and stirring the rice. When 1 cup of yam broth remains, the
rice should be tender. If not, add simmering water and continue
stirring until it is. Remove from heat immediately. 5. Vigorously
stir in the remaining yam broth. This should make a very soupy
porridge. Quickly stir in half the minced sage and chives, the
Parmesan, and the diced yam. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the
greens. Carefully stir in the mozzarella. Divide among bowls. Garnish
with a sprinkling of the spiced almonds and the remaining fresh sage
and chives and serve immediately. Serves 8 to 10 as a first course or
4 as a large main course.
