Peel, seed and section one of the grapefruits. Squeeze the juice from
the second grapefruit.

Lightly coat the scallops in seasoned flour, patting to remove the

about 1 minute per side. Transfer the scallops to a pan and set aside.

Add the grapefruit juice to the skillet and bring to a boil. Stir in
the walnuts, then add the scallops and grapefruit sections to the pan
and simmer gently until the scallops are cooked to taste, 2-3
minutes. Arrange on individual plates, sprinkle with chives and serve.
