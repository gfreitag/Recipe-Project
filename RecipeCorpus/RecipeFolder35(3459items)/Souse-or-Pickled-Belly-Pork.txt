Categories: Pickles, British isl, Meats

Historically sousing went hand in hand with the autumn slaughter.
When the hams and bacons were started smoking the trotters, ears,
cheeks and other bits went into a brine barrel. Richer farmers used
verjuice, spiced wine or spiced ale.

Use a clean earthen ware crock or a plastic bucket. Clean all your
equipment with a washing soda solution before starting. Make the
brine by heating the salt and saltpetre in 4 pints of water in a
large pan. Add the peppercorns and allspice in a muslim bag; if you
want sweet pickled pork add the sugar also. Boil for 10 min; then let
the brine cool and strain it through a muslim cloth into the pickling
crock. When the brine is cold add the pork, and keep it submerged
with a piece of clean boiled wood. Stir the brine occasionally with a
clean wooden spoon and turn the meat with cleaned wooden tongs. The
meat will be ready in about 3 days depending on the thickness of the
meat. Remove with tongs and cook; serve with broad beans or puree of
split peas.
