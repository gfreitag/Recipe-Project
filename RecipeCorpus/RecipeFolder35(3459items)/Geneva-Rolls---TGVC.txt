Categories: British isl, Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 16 servings
2 1/2 c  Milk; warmed
2 ea Eggs; at room temperature,
-beaten
1 ea Egg yolk, beaten, or milk
-to glaze
1/2 ts Saffron strands
4 tb ;hand-hot water
8 c  All-purpose flour
6 tb Butter; diced
1 pn Salt
4 ts Easy-blend dried yeast
Dissolve the saffron in the water and allow it to stand until the
water takes on the strong color.  In a large warm bowl mix together
the flour, butter, salt, and yeast.  Gradually add the saffron water
and approximately three-quarters of the warmed milk and knead either
by hand or machine until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Cover the
bowl with a cloth and leave in a warm place to rise for approximately
1 hour or until the dough has risen appreciably.  Reheat the
remaining milk and stir half of it into the eggs.  Add the mixture to
the dough and knead again briefly.  (If the dough seems dryish at his
point, the remaining milk may be added, otherwise, it may be retained
to glaze the rolls.)  Leave in a warm place another 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450F.  Grease a baking sheet and divide the dough
into 16 to 18 small rolls; glaze and bake the rolls for 15 minutes.
Reduce the heat to 425F and bake for about 5 minutes longer or until
the rolls are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the base.
