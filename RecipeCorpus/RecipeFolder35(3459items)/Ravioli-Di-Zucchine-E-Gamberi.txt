STEP FOUR: To Prepare the Sauce-- Peel and seed the tomato; chop in
small cubes. In the olive oil, cook the garlic and the shallot until

peeled shrimp and diced tomato. Cook for two minutes, add the grated
orange peel, and remove from the fire.

STEP FIVE: Cook the ravioli in salted boiling water. Add the chopped
parsley to the sauce. Dress the ravioli with tomato sauce and serve.
