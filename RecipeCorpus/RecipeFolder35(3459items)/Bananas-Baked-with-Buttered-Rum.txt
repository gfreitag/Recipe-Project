1. Preheat oven to 400Ã¸F.

2. Melt the butter. Combine with the lemon juice, maple syrup, rum,
and cinnamon.

3. Peel the bananas and slice in half lengthwise. Put them in a
shallow baking dish just big enough to hold them. Spoon the
buttered-rum mixture over the bananas.

4. Put the bananas in the oven and bake until they are soft, about 8
minutes.

turns into a glaze, 2-4 minutes. Garnish with mint leaves and
raspberries if desire.

Best when served warm.
