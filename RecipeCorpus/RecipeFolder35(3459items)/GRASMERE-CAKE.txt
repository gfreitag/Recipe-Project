Title: GRASMERE CAKE
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 cake
1 tb Milk
1 tb Lemon juice
6 oz Demerara sugar
6 oz Currants, cleaned
3 oz Sultanas, cleaned
12 oz Plain flour
1 ts Mixed spice
1 1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
6 oz Butter or margarine
1/2 pt Milk
Line a 9 3/4-in. by 5 3/4-in. loaf tin with greased greasproof paper.
Sift the flour, spic and bicarbonate of soda into a wide bowl; cut
the fat into small pieces and add to the bowl. Using the tips of the
fingers, rub the fat into the flour until the mixture resembles fine
breadcrumbs. Add the lemon juice to the milk (the milk will clot and
turn sour). Add the sugar, currants and sultanas to the dry
ingredients and mix well. Gradually add the soured milk, stirring
with a wooden spoon, until a dropping consistency is reached. Leave
the mixture covered for several hours or overnight. Turn the mixture
into the prepared tin. Level off the surface of the mixture with a
spatula or knife. Place the tin on a baking sheet and bake in the
centre of the oven at 325F for about 2 hours. The Grasmere cake
should be evenly risen and have a smooth surface. Leave it for a few
minutes in the tin before lifting it out on to a wire rack to cool.
Carefully remove the paper. Grasmere cake can be stored
satisfactorily for about 1 week. Wrap it in kitchen foil when cold,
or else wrap it in greaseproof paper and store in an airtight tin.

NOTE: If you prefer, omit the milk and lemon juice and use an
equivalent quantity of butter milk.
