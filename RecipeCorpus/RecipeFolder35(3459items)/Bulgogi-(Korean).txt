MMMMM-----------------------BULGOGI SAUCE----------------------------

1 tb Oil
Salt; to taste
1 ea Garlic clove; crushed
1 ts Sesame seed, toasted*
* Toasted sesame seed:  Place 1 cup sesame seed and 1 teaspoon salt
in a skillet, brown seeds slowly until they are toast-colored and
puffed. Stir constantly while toasting. Remove from heat and allow to
cool. Pulverize seeds in a mortar or a blender.  Store in a tightly
capped bottle. Cut beef into very thin strips and pound to flatten;
then cut into medium size squares.  Combine all the other
ingredients. The marinade, as the name of the dish implies, should be
quite fiery. Mix meat and marinade and set aside for 4 to 5 hours, or
longer if refrigerated. Broil very quickly over hot charcoal, dip in
Bulgogi sauce (next recipe) and serve immediately with white rice.
NOTE: The marinated beef can also be fried in hot peanut oil for just
a few minutes. Crush garlic with sugar and salt to make a smooth
paste. Combine with remaining ingredients.  Dip broiled or fried beef
slices in the sauce. From: sam Waring Date: 05-09-9
