Categories: Salsa/sauce, Cheese/eggs, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
-crushed
1/4 ts Mexican oregano
1 lb Velveeta Mexican Style
-process cheese spread
With jalapeno pepper
5-6 Slices Lean bacon,
-crumbled*
1/4 md Red bell pepper, minced
1/4 md Onion, minced
2 ea Cloves Garlic, minced
1/4 ts Dried cilantro leaves,
Remove as much fat as possible from bacon. In a skillet, cook bacon
over medium-low heat until crisp. Remove to paper towel to drain.
While bacon is cooking, seed and mince pepper, mince onion and
garlic. Saute vegetables in bacon drippings, until tender. Remove to
paper towel to drain. Crumble bacon. Cube Velveeta and place in a
microwave safe dish. Cover dish with wax paper and microwave on high
2 minutes. Add oregano and cilantro and stir. Return to microwave,
microwave on high one minute or until cheese is melted. Stir in
vegetables and bacon. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. To
serve, reheat in microwave until melted. Serve with baked potato,
french fries or asparagus. As a dip, use fresh raw vegetables such as
zucchini, celery, cauliflower, broccoli, carrot sticks and/or
tortilla chips. Warmed, spread on Ritz crackers or your favorite
cracker. Also can use Lebanon balogna, summer sausage, beef stick,
Vienna sausages or hot dog chunks as dippers. This should also be
good sliced cold for making cheeseburgers. Would also make good
cheese dogs and be great on meatloaf. *Using lean bacon and removing
as much fat as possible, doesn't give much drippings. May need to add
some oil to saute vegetables. SOURCE:* Jim Bodle POSTED BY: Jim Bodle
