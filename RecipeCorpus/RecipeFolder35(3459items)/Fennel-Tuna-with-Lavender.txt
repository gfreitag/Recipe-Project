MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 4 SERVINGS--------------------------

The author writes: "The combination of fennel and lavender...makes
canned tuna something special.  This recipe is just the ticket for a
quick off-the-shelf dinner." Drain tuna in a strainer; rinse with
cold water. Place tuna in a flat broiler-proof dish, breaking it up
as you do. Combine remaining ingredients and spread over tuna. Place
in a 350 F oven for 10 minutes (or in a microwave at half power for 3
minutes). Stir tuna to mix yogurt sauce into it; bake an additional 8
to 10 minutes (or microwave on high for 1 minute). Serve hot or cold.
