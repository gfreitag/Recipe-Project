FOR CHEESECAKE, beat cream cheese and sugar in large mixing bowl until
smooth. Beat in cocoa, flour, salt, and vanilla. Add eggs and egg
yolk, one at time, beating after each addition until very smooth. Add
melted semi-sweet chocolate and beat until chocolate is well
incorporated. Beat in whipping cream. Chop macadamia nuts coarsely.
Fold in chopped nuts and white chocolate by hand.

Pour into prepared chocolate crust. Bake at 350 F for 5 mins. Reduce
oven temperature to 325 F and bake 35 to 40 mins more. Cool on wire
rack for 2 hours. Refrigerate several hours or overnight before
unmolding.

FOR GANACHE, heat whipping cream to simmering in a saucepan. Remove
from heat and whisk in bittersweet chocolate chips. Whisk until
chocolate is completely meltd and mixture is smooth. Refrigerate
until thoroughly chilled, preferably overnight. Whip chilled mixture
gently until soft peaks form. Do not overmix. Smooth whipped ganache
evenly on top of cheesecake. (Extra ganache may be frozen for later
uses or enjoyed as an ice cream topping). Decorate cake with toasted
macadamia nuts and/or chocolate shavings, if desired.

Makes one 9- or 10-inch cake.
