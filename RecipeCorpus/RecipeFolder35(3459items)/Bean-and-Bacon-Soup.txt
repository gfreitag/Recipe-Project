Categories: Aust/german, Soup/stew, Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 10 servings
2    Onions, chopped
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Thyme or sage
6    Frankfurter Sausages,sliced
2 tb Parsley, chopped
1 lb Navy Beans,dried
6 c  Water
4 c  Beef Broth
1    Carrot, chopped
1    Celery Stalk, chopped
4    Thick slices of bacon,diced
Soak beans overnight.  In a 3-quart soup pot bring beans, water and
beef broth to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer an hour. Add carrot and
celery and continue cooking for 30 minutes.  In a separate pan cook
the bacon until almost done.  Add the onions; cook until golden. Set
aside. Mash soup through a sieve or use a food mill.  Return the
puree to the pot, add the bacon onion mixture and seasonings. Reheat.
Add the Frankfurters and cook about 5 min. Serve and garnish each
bowl with parsley.

Optional: You can also add garlic and red pepper [but it wouldn't be
German any more!] or substitute diced cooked smoked hocks or ham for
the bacon. Or cook the carrot and celery separately and add them to
the soup after it has been pureed , so that it has some texture.
