Title: Pork Tenderloin Brined in Beer
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 to 8 serve
1 ts Dried sage
Peel of 1 tangerine
Peel of 1 lemon
2 ea Whole pork tenderloins
-(about 4 pounds in all)
1 qt Water
1 qt Dark beer
1 c  Salt
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Whole black peppercorns
1/3 c  Crushed fennel seeds
Place all the ingredients, except the pork, in a large pot, bring to a
boil, and then reduce to a simmer.  Stir until the salt and sugar are
dissolved, then simmer an additional 5 minutes.  Transfer the brine
to a nonreactive container, cool, and refrigerate.

When the brine is quite cool (less than 50 degrees F.), add the pork
tenderloins and place a heavy plate on top of them to keep them
submerged. Marinate the pork in the refrigerator for 2 days.  Then
remove the pork, wash and pat dry.  It will keep 2 days in the
refrigerator before cooking.

Grill the tenderloins to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. or
pan-fry and roast them whole.  Brown them for 2 to 3 minutes per side
then place them in a 350 degree F. oven and cook for 20 minutes to an
internal temperature of 160 degrees F.  Cut each tenderloin into
thick slices on the diagonal.  Each tenderloin should serve two
people.  Serves 6 to 8.
