TO PREPARE BASE: Process the flour, sugar and cardamom in the food
processor for several seconds. Add the butter and process until dough
comes together. Pat the dough or gently roll the dough over the
bottom of the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges and
set, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool in the refrigerator until completely
cool, about 20 minutes.

TO PREPARE TOPPING: In a food processor, process the sugar, corn
syrup, vanilla, butter, lemon peel and eggs. The mixture will look
curdled. Add the flour and pulse to incorporate. Then pulse in the
nuts, coconut and soaked cranberries, do not mince. (This step can be
done by hand.)

Spread evenly over the cooked base. Bake the bars in the center of
the oven until top is golden and set, about 25 minutes. Allow them to
cool completely before cutting.
