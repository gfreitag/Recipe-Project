Categories: Breads, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
1 tb Oil, optional
3 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Warm water
1 tb SWEETENER
1 tb Yeast
Dissolve sweetener in water then stir in yeast. Let stand until yeast
begins to bubble 5-8 minutes. Stir in oil, if using, and salt. Add 1
1/2 cups flour. Beat vigorously for 1 minute. Add remaining flour
gradually. Use only amount necessary to handle dou

Variations:

For a lighter loaf, substitute 1/4 cup gluten flour for 1/4 cup whole
wheat flour. Or use 1 cup white flour in place of 1 cup whole wheat
flour.

If making a pizza crust, apple icing crust or pot pie crust. Reduce
yeast to 1 teaspoon. When making one of these crusts, try using all
whole hwat pastry flour instead of regula whole wheat flour. The
crust will be more tender. Source: Of These Ye May Freely Eat: A
