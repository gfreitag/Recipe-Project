Title: Sauce Chaud-Froid [Jellied White Sauce]
Categories: French, Poultry, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 5 cups
2 pk Gelatin
1/2 c  ;Cold water
2    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Cream
3 tb Butter
1/4 c  Flour
1 qt Chicken broth; or turkey
-clarified
Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour with a whisk.
Bring the broth to a boil and add all at once to the flour mixture,
whisking vigorously. When the sauce has thickened continue cooking 5
min over low heat. Soften the gelatin in cold water and add to the
sauce. Stir until dissolved. Remove from the heat. Beat the yolks
into the cream and stir into the hot sauce. Heat gently without
boiling and then cool but do not chill.

For glazed salmon use a salmon or fish stock. Match the chaud froid
stock to the food being coated.

A simpler version is Mayonnaise Collee. Soak 1 1/2 ts gelatin in 1
1/2 tb water and beat into 1 c mayonnaise. This will spread like cake
frosting with a spatula when chilled.
