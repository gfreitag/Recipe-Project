Title: Canning Shelling Peas
Categories: Can/preserv, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
-Makes 1 quart
3 lb To 6 lb in pods
Add a sugar salt mixture to bring out the flavor in this recipe. Mix
1 part salt with 2 parts sugar and add 2 teaspoons of the salt sugar
mixture to each pint jar before sealing. You'll need all the basic
equipment.

1. Choose young, tender, freshly gathered peas.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Wash, shell, then wash peas again. Drain.

4. COLD PACK: Pack the peas loosely into hot pint or quart jars to
within 1 inch of the tops. Don't shake or press down; peas need room
to expand as they cook. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar salt mixture to each
pint, 4 teaspoons to each quart, if desired. Or just add 1/2 teaspoon
salt to each pint, 1 teaspoon to each quart, if desired. Pour in
boiling water to within 1 inch of tops of jars. HOT PACK: Put peas in
a large saucepan, cover with boiling water, and heat to boiling. Boil
small peas 3 minutes; larger ones 5 minutes. Drain, rinse in hot
water, and drain again. Pack loosely into hot pint or quart jars to
within 1 inch of tops. If desired, add 1/2 teaspoon salt to pints, 1
teaspoon to quarts, or use the sugar salt mixture. Pour in boiling
water to within 1 inch of tops.

5. Run a slim non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling liquid to within 1 inch of tops
for hot pack, 1-1/2 inch of tops for cold pack.

6. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

7. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

8. Process at 10 pounds pressure, 40 minutes for quarts and pints.
Process extra large peas for 10 minutes more. Follow manufacturers
directions for your canner.

9. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
