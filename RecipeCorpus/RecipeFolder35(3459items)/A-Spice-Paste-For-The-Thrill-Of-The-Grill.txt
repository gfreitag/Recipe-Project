Title: A Spice Paste For The Thrill Of The Grill
Categories: Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Ground Cinnamon
1 ts Kosher Salt
1/4 c  Olive Oil
2    Clove Garlic -- minced
2 tb Fresh Oregano -- minced
1/4 c  Fresh Cilantro -- minced
2 tb Cumin Powder
2 tb Curry Powder
2 tb Sweet Paprika
2 tb Coriander Seed -- cracked
2 tb Black Peppercorns --
Cracked
Combine the cumin, curry powder, paprika, coriander seed, peppercorns,
cinnamon, and salt in a small cast-iron skillet. Dry roast over
medium-low heat until spices begin to smoke but not burn, about 3 to
5 mins. Transfer the roasted spices to a bowl. Add the olive oil,
garlic, oregano, and cilantro and mix well. Refrigerate in an
airtight container for up to 3 days.

Adapted from a recipe of Chris Schlesinger's, this paste is great with
steaks, chicken or veal chops. Rub meat with paste and refrigerate
for 4 to 6 hours before grilling. Bring to room temperature and grill
over hot coals until medium rare, about 4 mins per side.

Makes 3/4 cup.
