Named after the Italian ladies of the night ("Puttane"), this sauce
goes well with any type of spaghetti. Heat oil m a skillet over low
heat. Add garlic and saute until golden. Add sieved tomatoes and cook
5 minutes. Stir in anchovies, then tomato paste. Add capers, olives
and pepper flakes. Cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once pasta
is cooked, if there's a delay in combining it with the sauce, toss it
with 2 tablespoons olive oil; or briefly rinse it under hot water.
This will keep it from stickmg.
