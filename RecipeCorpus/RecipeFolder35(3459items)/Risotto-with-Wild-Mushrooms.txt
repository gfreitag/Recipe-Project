Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 2 servings
1    Portobello mushroom, sliced
1 1/4 ts Salt
3/4 ts Pepper
1/2 c  White wine
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 c  Dried porcini mushrooms
1 c  Cold water
4 c  Vegetable or other stock
1 tb Butter or olive oil
1/4 c  Shallots, chopped
1 c  Arborio rice
1. Soak the porcini in the cold water for 30 minutes. Lift the
mushrooms from the soaking water, squeezing them over the water to
return any liquid to the cup; dice the mushrooms. Strain the porcini
water through a fine-mesh sieve and add it to the stock.

2. Heat the stock until it reaches a low simmer, then adjust the heat
so that it stays just at the simmering point.

3. Heat the butter over low heat in a wide heavy pot. Add the
shallots and saut until they begin to soften, 3-4 minutes. Add the
rice and stir well to coat the grains. Add the porcini and portobello
mushrooms and saut for 2 minutes.

4. Add a ladle of stock (about « cup). Stir until the liquid is
absorbed. Add the salt and pepper. Keep the heat under the rice at
medium and the liquid always simmering.

5. After adding 3 or 4 ladles of stock, add the wine. Continue to stir
frequently and to add a ladle of stock at a time. When the rice is
almost cooked through, in about 20-25 minutes. reduce the amount of
stock added each time. As soon as the rice is cooked, remove it from
the heat. Stir in the grated cheese and serve hot.
