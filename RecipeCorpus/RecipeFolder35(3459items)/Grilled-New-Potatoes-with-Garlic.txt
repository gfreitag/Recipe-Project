Puncture several holes  in  each packages.  Place on grill rack over
hot coals, turning several times, until cooked, about 7 minutes
total. Unwrap and serve immediately. Makes 6 serv- ings. Puncturing
the foil with holes allows some ot the smokiness to permeate the
potatoes. Submitted By PHILLIP WATERS   On   09-23-95
