peeler and add it to the wine mixture. Cut the white rind off the
lemons and cut the flesh into Â¬-inch slices.

Add the dried fruit and sugar to the wine mixture, cover the pan, and
gently simmer for 15 minutes, adding cider or water as necessary to
keep the fruit moist. Add the lemon slices and simmer, uncovered, for
10 minutes, or until the fruit is soft and the juices form a thick
syrup. Add sugar to taste. Let the compote cool to room temperature
before serving.

Note: If desired, tie the whole spices and strips of lemon zest in
cheesecloth and remove before serving.
