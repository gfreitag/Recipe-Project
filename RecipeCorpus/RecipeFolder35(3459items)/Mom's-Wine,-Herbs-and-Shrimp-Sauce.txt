Shrimp go well with either ziti or penne, but this recipe is just as
good served with any type of pasta.

Heat oil in a skillet and saute zucchini and garlic 2 minutes.  Add
tomatoes and shrimp and simmer 2 minutes.  Add remainmg 5 ingredients
and simmer a few minutes more, until shrimp turn opaque.

Pasta is made from durum wheat.  Semolina is the milled heart of durum
wheat, hence pasta which is sold as 100% semolina is the best. **
