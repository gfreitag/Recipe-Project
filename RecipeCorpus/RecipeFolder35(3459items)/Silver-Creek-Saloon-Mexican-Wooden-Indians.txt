Begin with a recipe of sweet yeast bread dough. Make as usual and
allow to rise a second time. Store in refrigerator until needed. Cook
lean beef roast overnight or until very tender. Shred and season with
salt, cayenne pepper, and spicy salsa that contains onion. For each
Mexican Wooden Indian, roll out a piece of the bread dough 1/2-inch
thick and 8 x 8 inches square. Place several Tbs of beef filling in
center of dough along with some jack and Cheddar cheese. Seal dough
by rolling it and pinching the ends so that the meat filling can't
escape. It looks similar to a small rolling pin. Carefully lower the
dough into preheated fryer of vegetable shortening set at 350 F. Cook
for 3 to 4 mins or until golden brown. To make sure the meat mixture
is hot, put into microwave for another minute. Cut dough diagonally
into 3 pieces and serve on a large platter surrounded with a bed of
lettuce and diced tomatoes. Top with more salsa and sour cream if
desired. Makes 2 to 3 servings.
