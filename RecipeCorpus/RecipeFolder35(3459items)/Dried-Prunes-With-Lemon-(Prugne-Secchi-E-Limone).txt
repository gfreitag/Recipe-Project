The lemon adds a zesty contrast to the flavor of the prunes. My
grandmother used to make these for breakfast. You can also serve them
as a dessert at lunch or dinner.

1 pound dried pitted prunes 1 lemon, sliced into thin rounds Boiling
water to just cover

1. Place the prunes and lemon slices in a medium-size non-aluminum,
heat-proof mixing bowl.

2. Add the boiling water. Stir the prunes once, cover the bowl, and
allow to stand at room temperature until cool. Stir again, transfer
to a storage container, and refrigerate until ready to serve. Can
keep in the refrigerator for at least a week.
