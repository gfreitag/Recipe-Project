Cut the meat in to Â«-inch thick medallions. Marinate in the orange
juice and gin in a shallow dish for 20-30 minutes/

Pick through the cranberries, removing any stems. combine the wine,
maple syrup, zests and cinnamon stick in a heavy saucepan and bring
to a boil. Add the cranberries, reduce the heat, and gently simmer
for 3-4 minutes, or until barely cooked. Remove the pan from the heat
the moment the cranberry skins begin to split; they should not be
mushy.

Strain the berries over another heavy saucepan. Discard the zests and
cinnamon stick, and boil the sauce until thick and syrupy. There
should be about 3/4 cup sauce. Let it cool slightly and stir in the
cranberries. Add salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste. Keep the
sauce warm.

Just before serving, drain the meat and thoroughly blot dry. Season
each medallion with coarse salt and cracked black pepper. Heat the
oil in a non-stick skillet over high heat. Cook the meat for 1 minute
per side, or until cooked to taste. Spoon the cranberry sauce on a
platter or plates and arrange the medallions on tops. Garnish with
herb sprigs and serve at once.

way.
