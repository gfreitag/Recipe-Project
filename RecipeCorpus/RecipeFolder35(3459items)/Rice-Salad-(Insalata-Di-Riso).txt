Tender grains of rice studded with a confetti of fresh, crisp
vegetables and ripe black olives make this a colorful, fresh-tasting
salad.

1 cup uncooked Italian short-grain rice (Arborio, Vialone, or
Carnaroli) 3 cups water Salt to taste 3 small, fresh Italian plum
tomatoes, cored, seeded, and finely chopped 1/2 cup finely chopped
zucchini 1/3 cup finely chopped yellow bell pepper 1/2 cup grated
carrot 1/2 cup pitted Gaeta olives, chopped Freshly ground black
pepper to taste 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon red wine
vinegar

1. Combine the rice and water with salt in a medium-size saucepan and
bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Then stir the rice
once, cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 18
minutes, until the rice is tender but firm, al dente. Drain the rice
in a colander and refresh under cold water. Transfer to a large
serving bowl, cover, and allow to cool slightly.

2. When the rice is at room temperature, add the tomatoes, zucchini,
pepper, carrot, and olives, then season with salt and pepper. Add the
olive oil and vinegar, toss well, and serve.
