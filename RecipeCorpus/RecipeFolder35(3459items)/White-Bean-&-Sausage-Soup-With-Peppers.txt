Title: White Bean & Sausage Soup With Peppers
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables, Sausage
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Chicken broth
1 1/4 c  White beans, dried -- soaked
-overnight
1    Red bell pepper
1    Green bell pepper
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 lb Kielbasa
Salt and pepper -- to taste
4 tb Butter
2 c  Onion -- finely chopped
2    Carrots -- peeled and
-chopped
3    Cloves garlic -- minced
6    Sprigs parsley
1 ts Dried thyme
1    Bay leaf
Melt the butter in a pot.  Add onions, carrots and garlic and cook,
covered over low heat until vegetables are tender and lightly
colored, about 25 minutes.  Add parsley, thyme and bay leaf and pour
in the stock. Drain the beans and stir them into the pot.  Bring to a
boil, reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until beans are very
tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Pour the soup through a strainer,
reserving the stock; discard the bay leaf, and transfer the solids to
the bowl of a food processor. Add 1 cup of the cooking stock and
process until smooth.  Return pureed soup to the pot and stir in the
additional cooking liquid, 2 to 3 cups, until the soup is of the
desired consistency.  Cut away stems and ribs of the peppers and dice
them. Heat olive oil in a small skillet and peppers and saute over
low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender but still crunchy,
about 15 minutes. Transfer peppers to the soup with a slotted spoon.
Skin the kielbasa if necessary, dice it and add it to the soup. Set
over medium heat and cook, partially covered, until heated through,
about 15 minutes. Season to taste.  Serve immediately.
