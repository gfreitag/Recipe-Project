Categories: Asian, Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Sugar (see NOTE)
pn Salt
16 oz Coconut milk
6    Bananas
6 tb Whole pearl tapioca
1/2 c  Water
Peel and slice the bananas at an angle about 1/3-inch thick.  Set
aside.

In a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients, combine whole pearl
tapioca with the water.  Cook over low heat until tapioca balls become
transparent.  (Note: If using instant tapioca, follow package
instructions using coconut milk instead of milk and eliminating the
egg and vanilla.) Add the sugar, salt, coconut milk, and bananas.
Return to a boil; stir carefully to prevent sticking.  As soon as it
boils, it is ready to serve.

Makes 6 servings.

NOTE:  Be aware that this dish has the characteristic sweetness of
many Asian desserts.  You may prefer to reduce the sugar by a third.
