Categories: Soup/stew

4 oz Green chilies -- chopped
1 ts Dried oregano

3 tb Lime juice
2 qt Chicken broth or water
1/2 lb Split green peas

Combine the broth and peas in a large soup pot.  Slowly bring the

mince the coriander.  Thinly slice the green onions.  Toast the
tortillas at 350 until dry and crisp. Break the tortillas into 1"
pieces.  When the split peas and potatoes are tender, add the corn,
chilies, oregano and cumin.  Simmer for 10 minutes. Season to taste
with salt and tabasco.  Add the tortillas, coriander, green onions
and lime juice.  Simmer until the tortillas soften, 2 to 3 minutes
more.  Adjust the seasoning and serve hot.
