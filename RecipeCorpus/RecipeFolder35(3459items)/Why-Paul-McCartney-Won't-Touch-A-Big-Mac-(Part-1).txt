WHY PAUL MCCARTNEY WON'T
-TOUCH A BIG MAC
============================
-============
For almost 21 years Paul and Linda McCartney have been vegetarian.
Linda's views are well known. But rarely has paul spoken at length
about his vegetarian beliefs. Here, he explains just why he could
never eat meat again. "For us going veggie was really only down to
one thing - that Linda and I both grew up being mad-keen
nature-lovers. She, over on her side of the world, was looking under
rocks for salamanders in posh Scarsdale, where she grew up. With me,
I was in Speke in Liverpool. But right off the edge of Speke there
was countryside So while Linda was looking for her salamanders, I'd
be out looking for frogs and sticklebacks. When we hooked up I was
with The Beatles and had this feeling that there wasn't such a thing
as nature anymore - 'cos I'd left it. Then, when we got married,
Linda started saying "Let's go to the countryside, let's get out of
London", so we'd drive an hour out, just anywhere. Linda'd say "Try
and get lost" and I'd be there saying "I can't, I'm driving". She'd
say "Just try it". It was never a problem, there were plenty of
signs. So she was like a new adventure for me, bringing back this
nature thing. Anyway, I had a farm in Scotland which I didn't really
like. I'd never really fixed it up at all. So Linda said to me that
we could do the place up, take down the old shed and re-do all the
walls. Anyway, over the years we got it all together and instead of
having an old neighbour looking after the animals, we did it.
Eventually we got our own sheep and started looking after them. So it
got really nice with the sheep and we got to start understanding all
the animals. Anyway, one day we were having Sunday lunch - we were
still meat-eaters, just building a home with the kids and that - and
Linda was a really good meat cook. We were eating roast lamb for
Sunday lunch and it was the lambing season and there were all these
beautiful little lambs gambolling around. Then we just looked at the
lamb on our plate and looked at them outside again and thought "we're
eating one of those little things that is gaily running around
outside". It just struck us, and we said "Wait a minute maybe we
don't want to do this". And that was it, that was the big turning
point and we said we'd give up meat.
