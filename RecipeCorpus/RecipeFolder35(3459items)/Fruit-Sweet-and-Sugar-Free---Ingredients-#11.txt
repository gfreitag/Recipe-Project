Tahini: ******* Tahini is made from hulled roasted or hulled unroasted
sesame seeds. It is rich in calcium, phosphorus, lecithin, iron,
Vitamins B and E, and protein. Unroasted or raw tahini can be
purchased in natural food stores, whereas roasted tahini can be
purchased in either natural food stores or major supermarkets.
Maranatha Foods and Westbrae Natural Foods manufacture and nationally
distribute both roasted and raw tahini. Once opened, tahini is best
stored in the refrigerator to keep it from becoming rancid. Roasted
tahini is called for in most recipes. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On
