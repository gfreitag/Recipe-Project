Title: Halibut al Tabaccaio
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Canola or peanut oil
Porcini Oil
1/2 oz Dried porcini
1 1/4 lb Halibut *
Salt and pepper
* or fillets of Atlantic cod, true snapper, grouper, striped bass, or
halibut

In a spice or coffee grinder, grind the porcini to a fine powder,
rotating the grinder as you go so that all the porcini come into
contact with blades. Pour the powder onto a plate.

Cut the fish into 4 equal portions and season on both sides with salt
and pepper. Let stand for about 10 minutes. This allows the fish to
"sweat", as the salt draws moisture to the surface and makes it
easier for the porcini powder to adhere to the fish.

Dredge the fish in the porcini powder, coating it heavily on all
sides. (If you don't use all the powder, seal the remainder in a jar
or a plastic bag for later use.)

Warm the oil in a cast-iron or non-stick frying pan. SautÂ‚ the fish
over medium-high heat until it yields easily to the tip of a knife,
4-6 minutes per side. Serve on warm plates with a wedge of lemon and
about 1 tbs porcini oil (solids included). Fine Cooking
