When the frost beats the ripening of some of your tomatoes, turn them
into this terrific mincemeat. A jar or 2 makes a fine gift. Because
of low acid ingredients, this recipe must be processed in a pressure
canner. The yield is about 10 pints. You'll need all the basic
equipment for steam pressure canning, plus a grater and a large bowl.

1. Organize and prepare ingredients, equipment, and work area.

2. Sprinkle salt over tomatoes in a large bowl or container, and then
let stand 1 hour. Drain.

3. Meanwhile heat water in large kettle to boiling. Add tomatoes and
let stand 5 minutes. Drain well.

4. Combine all ingredients in large kettle and heat to boiling.

5. Pour or ladle hot mincemeat into hot jars to within 1 inch of tops
of jars. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar
to release air bubbles. Add more hot liquid to within 1 inch of tops,
in necessary.

6. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a clean damp cloth.

7. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

8. Process at 10  pound pressure for 25 minutes. Follow manufacturer's
directions for your canner.

9. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
