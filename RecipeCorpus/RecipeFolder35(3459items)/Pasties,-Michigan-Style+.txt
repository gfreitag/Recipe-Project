Yield: 6 pasties
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Lard (3/4 lb.)
Ice water-10-12 tb.
4 c  Unsifted four
2 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
-into 1/4" cubes, about
-1 1/2 cups
1 1/2 c  Onion, finely chopped
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Salt
2 lb Top round steak trimmed of
-fat and cut in 1/4" cubes
5 md Red potatoes, about 1 1/2
-lbs, peeled and coarsely
-chopped
3 md Turnips, scraped and cut
In a large chilled bowl combine the flour, 2 ts. of the salt and the
lard. Working quickly, rub the flour and fat together with your
fingertips until it looks like flakes of coarse meal. pour in 10 tb.
of ice water, toss together, and gather the dough into a ball. if the
dough crumbles, add up to 2 tb. more of the ice water, a teaspoon at
a time, until the particles adhere. Divide the dough into 6 equal
size balls, dust them with flour and wrap in wax paper. Refrigerate
for at least 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the beef, potatoes, turnips,
onions, the tablespoon of salt and the pepper in a bowl and stir them
together.

on a lightly floured surface, roll out one ball of dough at a time
into a rough circle about 1/4" thick. Using a plateor pot lid about
9" in diameter as a guide, cut dough into a round with a pastry wheel
or a sharp knife. place about 1 1/2 cups of the filling mixture on
the round. Place the filling in the center and spread it a bit so
it's oblong. Leave plenty of crust all around in order to close it.
Pull up the dough at one end of the strip, then pull up the dough on
that end of the strip (each side) and close snugly. Starting from the
sealed end, press the two edges of the round together to encase the
filling securely and form a double-thick band of dough about 1/2"
wide. With your fingers, crimp the band into a decorative rope or
scalloped fluting. Tightly close the other end. With a large spatula,
carefully transfer the pasty to an ungreased pastry sheet. Then
repeat the procedure to roll, fill and shape the remaining pasties.

Bake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes or until the pasties are
golden brown. Serve them hot or at room temperature.
