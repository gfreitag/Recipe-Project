Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 6 servings

Bitter Campari cuts the sweetness of the orange juice to make a
surprisingly new flavor that will delight and refresh.

4 cups fresh orange juice, with the pulp and seeds removed 1/4 cup
Campari 1 cup (about) Sugar Syrup

1. Combine the orange juice and Campari with the sugar syrup in a
large non-aluminum plastic or metal mixing bowl. Taste and add more
syrup if the mixture seems too sour. Mix well and place the bowl,
uncovered, in your freezer.

2. After an hour the mixture will have begun to freeze around the
sides of the bowl. Using a wooden spoon, free the ice from the sides
of the bowl. Stir the mixture well and return it to the freezer.
Repeat this step every hour for the next 4 to 6 hours, until the
mixture is quite thick and slushy.

3. Transfer the orange juice mixture to a food processor fitted with
the double-edge steel blade and process for about 15 seconds, until
the mixture is light and frothy. Transfer to a plastic container,
cover tightly, and return to the freezer until ready to serve. If you
don't intend to serve it the same day, refrigerate 2 hours before
serving so that you can scoop it.
