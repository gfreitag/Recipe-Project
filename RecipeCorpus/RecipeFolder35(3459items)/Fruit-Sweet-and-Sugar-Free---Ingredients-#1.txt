quality of your ingredients and how you work with them will affect the
quality, flavour, texture, and appearance of your finished products.
Some of the items in this introduction may be new to you, or they may
be used in unfamiliar ways. This information will assist you with all
of your baking and most especially with the recipes in this book.

Almond Milk: ************ Almond milk is a delicious, protein-rich
alternative to cow's milk. It can be used in any recipe without
alterations in amounts or techniques. To make almond milk, blend
blanched almonds and water on high speed for five minutes. Strain
this mixture through a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth. The
almond pulp remaining in the strainer will have almost no flavour and
should be discarded. The usual proportion of almond milk is 4 parts
water to 1 part almonds (written as 4:1). However this proportion of
water to almonds can be varied depending on how rich a milk is
desired. The lower the ratio of water to almonds, the richer the
milk. A rich almond milk would be 3:1. Keep almond milk under
refrigeration and use it within 4 days.

Amazake: ******** Amazake, or rice milk is a whole-grain product made
by adding cultured brown rice (koji) to sweet brown rice and water.
The mixture is then fermented into a thick liquid that is used both
as a sweetener and a beverage. Amazake is about 21 per cent sugar,
mainly glucose and maltose, and it is high in carbohydrates and other
nutrients, including vitamin B and iron. Amazake comes in many
flavours; however, plain or vanilla is preferred for baking. Amazake
can be purchased in natural food stores in the freezer or the
refrigerator section in half pint, pint, and quart bottles. Once
opened, it will keep for a week under refrigeration.

Apples: ******* Many varieties of apples are available all year long,
but do experiment with some of the shorter-lived fall and winter
varieties. For most recipes, tart, crisp apples are recommended, such
as Granny Smiths, Pippins, and Gravensteins. Golden Delicious
applies, which seem to be available everywhere all the time, will
also work well as long as they have not become too old and mealy. For
the least amount of waste, use a vegetable peeler instead of a knife
to peel apples. Apples can be kept from turning brown after they have
been sliced or cut by tossing them into a small amount of lemon juice
diluted with water.

Baking Powder: ************** Natural food stores sell baking powder
that is free of the aluminum compounds that many people consider to be
unhealthy. Baking powder has about a one-year shelf life and should be
replaced yearly. Store baking powder in an airtight container in a
cupboard, not in the refrigerator, to avoid loss of strength due to
humidity.
