TO REDUCE CHOLESTEROL or SATURATED FATS:

1.  Select lean cuts of meat. 2. Serve moderate portions. 3. Replace
animal fats with appropriate substitutes.

Examples:
Use Butter, lard, bacon or
Instead of
Polyunsaturated margarine or oil
bacone fat, and chicken
fat. Sour cream Low-fat yogurt Whole milk Skim milk Whole milk
cheeses Low-fat cheeses Whole eggs Egg whites or egg substitutes.

NOTE:  Many cheeses, although made with skim milk, have cream added to
them.  Check labels for fat content.

****************************** TO REDUCE CALORIES or FATS:

1.  Brown meat by broiling or cooking in a non-stick pans with little
or no oil. 2. Chill soups, stews, sauces and broths. Lift off the
congealed fat (saves 100 calories per tablespoon of fat removed). 3.
Trim the fat from the meat.  Also remove the skin from poultry. 4.
Use water-packed canned products (canned fish & canned fruits). 5. In
recipes for baked products, the sugar can often be reduced 1/4 to 1/3
without harming the final product.  Cinnamon and vanilla also give
the impression of sweetness. 6. Use fresh fruit whenever possible.
If canned fruit must be used, select water-packed varieties, fruit in
its own juice or drain the heavy syrup from the canned fruits. 7. For
sauces and dressings, use low-calorie bases (vinegar, mustard, tomato
juice, fat-free bouillon) instead of high calorie ones (creams, fats,
oils, mayonnaise).
