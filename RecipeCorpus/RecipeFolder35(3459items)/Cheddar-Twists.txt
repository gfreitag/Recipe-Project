ends to seal. Twist each rope two or three times. Place on large
baking sheet sprayed with Baker's Joy Baking Spray. Cover; let rise
in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 20 to 40 min.
Combine egg white and 1 Tbsp. (15 mL) water. Brush dough with egg
white mixture. Sprinkle with poppy or sesame seed, if desired. Bake
in 400 degree F (200 degree C) oven 10 to 15 min. or until done.
