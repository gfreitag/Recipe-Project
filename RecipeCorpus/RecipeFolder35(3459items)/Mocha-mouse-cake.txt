Title: Mocha mouse cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 pie
1 pk Unflavored gelatin
1 3/4 c  Brown sugar
2 ea Chocolate pie crusts
1 qt WHOLE REAL CREAM
1 pk Yogurt starter
1/4 c  Undutched cocoa
1 oz Unsweet chocolate
*** you must use whole real dairy cream not the kind you buy in the
supermarket, and un dutched (not processed with alkali) or the mouse
will not set up correctly.  Most supermarkets carry undutched or
"dark cocoa" cocoa, and health food stores or local small dairies
will have real cream.

Yogurt starter is available in health food stores in freeze dried
packets, or you can use LIVE yogurt (1 TB = 1 pk) with no flavoring
(some vanilla yogurts will also work)

Warm the cream, cocoa, chocolate, gelatin together to 180 degrees and
hold for two minutes.  Cool to 110 degrees, add yogurt starter.
incubate in a yogurt maker or a quart jar in water bath (double
boiler type setup) at 110 to 114 degrees for 8 hours, add the brown
sugar stirring slowly until dissolved (but don't whip the cream
yet!), refrigerate for 8 hours, whip to stiff peaks, spoon into two
pie shells, freeze until served (if you prefer a softer mouse you can
keep in the refrigerator however this will not keep as long, and is
much harder to handle)
