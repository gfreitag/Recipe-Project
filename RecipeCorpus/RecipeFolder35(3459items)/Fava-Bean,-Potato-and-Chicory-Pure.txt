Title: Fava Bean, Potato and Chicory Pure
Categories: Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 6 servings
Potatoes (14oz)
Peeled, thickly sliced
Salt and pepper
1/2 lb Wild chicory or watercress
Stems trimmed
1 c  Peeled and split
Dried mini-fava beans (5oz)
Rinsed and drained
1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
2 md Idaho or Yukon Gold
1. Put the fava beans in a large saucepan. Add 5 cups water and 1 tbs
oil and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover partially and simmer
for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook over moderately high heat
until both are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed, about
30 minutes. Season with ¬ tsp salt.

2. Meanwhile, rinse and shred the greens. Place them in a nonreactive
saucepan with the water still clinging to the leaves. Add a pinch of
salt, cover and cook over moderately high heat, tilting the pan
occasionally to drain off the bitter liquid. When the leaves are dry,
add 1/3 cup of water and cook, uncovered, stirring until the greens
are tender and most of the water has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Transfer the greens to a mortar and crush to a
coarse pure; reserve any cooking liquid.

3. Work the beans and potatoes through the fine disk of a food mill
or mash by hand. Beat in just enough of the cooking liquid to make a
smooth and fluffy pure. Gradually beat in the remaining olive oil
and then the crushed greens. Season with salt and white pepper. Mound
the pure on a shallow serving dish and serve warm. Do not reheat.
