VENTILATION KEY - Kitchens generate a tremendous amount of airborne
grease, odors, and other elements.  It is important to install a good
ventilation system and us a range hood to keep the air moving.  Well
placed windoews, skylights and plants are good natural ventilators
and air cleaners.

OUT OF SIGHT GARBAGE AND COMPOST - With the ehightened awareness of
recycling, more and more commercial recycling disposal units have
been put on the market.  In general, you want to hide garbage cans
behind a cupboard door and keep recyclables near the garbage.
Composting is an excellent way to reuse organic wastes that might
otherwise stink up the garbage can. But the sights and smells of
kitchen compost are not pleasant. To lessen the downsides of
composting, place the compost bin in a corner and under cover. Do not
add meats to the compost pile. Origin: Household Hints + Formulas, by
