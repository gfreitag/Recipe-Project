a floured rolling pin to 1/4-in. thickness. Flour Springerle mold and
quickly press design. Cut around design and place on a greased baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover lightly with a towel. Allow
cookies to dry for 12 hours or overnight. Dust off excess flour with

Notes: lemon or almond extract can be substituted for the anise
extract or seed. After cookies have cooled, the design can be
"painted" with food coloring. If cookies become too hard, place a cut
apple in the storage container to soften
