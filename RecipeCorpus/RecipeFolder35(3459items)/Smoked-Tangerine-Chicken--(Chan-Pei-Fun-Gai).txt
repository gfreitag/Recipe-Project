1    Whole star anise
3 tb Brown sugar
Heavy foil
Fresh coriander leaves
1    3# Chicken

Wipe chicken inside and out with paper towels.  Combine soy, salt,
sugar and rub inside and out on chicken.  Allow to marinate for 20
minutes, then put in steamer for 15 minutes.

In mortar and pestle crush tangerine peel and star anise as finely as
possible and mix with brown sugar.  Use a large sauce pan with a tight
fitting lid. Line the base of pan with foil, slightly up the sides.
Sprinkle sugar and spice mixture evenly over foil, and use a trivet
or rack to elevate the chicken above it.  Put over medium heat,
covered, until smoke escapes.  Turn heat down and smoke for 15
minutes or until done. May be served hot or cold.  Garnish with
sprigs of coriander. Submitted By CRAIG SCHROEDER   On   10-29-95
