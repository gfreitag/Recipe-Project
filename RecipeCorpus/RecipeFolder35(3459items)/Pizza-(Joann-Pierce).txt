This is a recipe from a place called Tony's Pizza here in Oregon.
A friend used to work there. It is WONDERFUL!

When yeast rises, add to flour & mix. Then add cold mixture and
stir until flour disapears. Knead till smooth. Divide into 2 - 3
balls. Coat with oil and place on a plate. Cover with damp cloth and
refrigerate until ready to use. Roll out gently with hands.
Bake at 450 degrees.

Mix all together - spread on unbaked crust - garnish as desired
with cheeses and meats, etc.
