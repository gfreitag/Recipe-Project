The Italian Way; Judith
Most of the sorbet and granita recipes that follow call for the
addition of sugar syrup- a cooked combination of sugar, water, and
lemon juice. It combines with the fruit or juice without leaving any
undissolved sugar granules in the finished product. You should make
your sugar syrup ahead of time because it must be cool or preferably
cold when it is added to the fruit or fruit juice. It will keep for
several weeks in your refrigerator.

1 3/4 cups sugar 1 cup cold water Juice of 1/2 lemon

Combine the sugar, water, and lemon juice in a small non-aluminum
saucepan. Stir well. Bring to a boil over high heat. Allow it to boil
briskly for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture turns clear. Cool
completely, or refrigerate. It can keep in the refrigerator for
several months.
