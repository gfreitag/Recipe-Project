Title: Eggless White Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 9" cakes
1/2 c  Corn syrup
1/2 c  Corn oil
3/4 c  Water
1 tb Lemon juice
2 3/4 c  White flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  White sugar
Preheat oven to 350F.

Combine dry ingredients.  Mix well & ensure there are no lumps.  Add
the wet ingredients in order listed.  Stir until well mixed.  The
mixture should be thick & heavy.  Spoon mixture into 2 well oiled &
floured 9" baking pans.  Smooth the tops with a spatula as much as
possible.

Bake for up to 30 minutes.  Check for doneness after 20 minutes & if
not done, cook for another 5 minutes & check again.  Remove from oven
& cool on wire racks for 10 minutes.  Carefully turn out onto a wire
rack to cool completely.  Layer with jam & a lemon icing.

NOTE:  It is essential to oil & flour the pans well as the corn syrup
does make the batter very sticky.  Unlike most sponge cakes, this one
does not sag in the middle & while quite light, is still good &
hearty.
