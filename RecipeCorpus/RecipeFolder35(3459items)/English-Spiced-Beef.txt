Title: English Spiced Beef
Categories: Pickles, British isl, Meats, Holiday
Yield: 6 lb
1 oz Allspice berries
4 oz Sea salt
1/4 oz Saltpetre
6 lb Joint of beef
3 oz Light brown sugar
1 oz Black peppercorns
1 oz Juniper berries
This was one of the great Victorian Christmas season dishes; the
perfect centre piece for a cold supper buffet. A neat round joint of
silverside or topside is the best for this kind of dish. Saltpetre is
a necessary preservative when curing meat and also adds a pleasing
red color- otherwise the beef will turn out a murky grey.

Rub the meat all over with the sugar and put it in a pot with a lid
for 2 days. Leave it in a cool place, turning and rubbing the meat
occasionally with the sticky liquor that develops.

Crush the peppercorns, juniper and allspice with a pestle and mortar
and mix with the salt and saltpetre. Rub this mixture well into the
meat and leave it in the pot for a further 9 days. Turn the meat and
rub the pickling mixture into the flesh daily.

When the pickling is complete, remove the beef and rub off any excess
spices adhering to the surface. Do not rinse it. Wrap the meat in
cooking foil [the Victorians used suet] and put into a large
ovenproof pot. Add about 10 fl oz water, cover the pot with a double
layer of foil and fit the lid on tightly. Pre-heat the oven to 275
deg F. Bake the meat slowly allowing 45 min per lb. When the meat is
cooked, remove the pot and set aside until it is quite cold.

Unwrap the meat, drain off any excess liquid and place on a board.
Cover with foil, put a weight on it and leave for at least 24 hr.
Carve the meat into thin slices and serve with anything from good
mustard to pickled kumquats.
