Title: Self-Rising Flour Substitute
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INFORMATION-----------------------------
Note: DO NOT GO OUT AND BUY SELF-RISING FLOUR!  It's expensive, it
goes bad quickly, and unless you make bread everyday, you'll never
use the whole bag!!!!

for each cup of "self-rising" flour that you need, use instead:

1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4
teaspoon baking soda

If recipe already has salt in it, you may want to omit the salt from
the original recipe.
