The refreshing taste of this grapefruit granita quenches and cools.

4 cups fresh grapefruit juice, with the pulp and seeds removed 1 cup
(about) Sugar Syrup

1. Combine the grapefruit juice with the sugar syrup in a large
non-aluminum plastic or metal mixing bowl. Taste and add more syrup
if the mixture seems too sour. Mix well and place the bowl,
uncovered, in your freezer.

2. After an hour the mixture will have begun to freeze around the
sides of the bowl. Using a wooden spoon, free the ice from the sides
of the bowl. Stir the mixture well and return it to the freezer.
Repeat this step every hour for the next 4 to 6 hours, until the
mixture is quite thick and slushy.

3. Transfer the grapefruit juice mixture to a food processor fitted
with the double-edge steel blade and process for about 15 seconds,
until the mixture is light and frothy. Transfer to a plastic
container, cover tightly, and return to the freezer until ready to
serve. If you don't intend to serve it the same day, refrigerate 2
hours before serving so that you can scoop it.
