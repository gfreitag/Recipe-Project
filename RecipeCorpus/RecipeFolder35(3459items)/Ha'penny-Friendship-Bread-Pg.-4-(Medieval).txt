FRIENDSHIP POEM
FRIENDSHIP POEM:  "A penny for happy thoughts, Grains that grow and
nourish, Leavenings to lift us up, May friendship ever flourish."These
lovely friendship loaves were inspired by the "Begger's Rhyme" of
unknown origin..."Christmas is coming, the geese are getting fat,
plase put a penny in the old man's hat, If you haven't got a penny, a
ha'penny will do, If you haven't got a ha'penny--God Bless You!"

This special message to accompany your gift breads (the Friendship
Poem), is sure to spread the feeling of warm frienship and good will.
I have never tried this recipe. It comes from my "Pillsbury Festive
Holiday Recipes" cookbook, Classic #13. Marilyn Sultar
