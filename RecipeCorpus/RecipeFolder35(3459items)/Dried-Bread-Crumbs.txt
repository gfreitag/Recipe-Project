Title: Dried Bread Crumbs
Categories: Breads, Information
Yield: 1 batch
-baguette or other bread
Any size good-quality
Leave the bread out for several days. It should become as hard as a
baseball bat. Break or cut the stale bread into chunks; put these
into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off until the bread
has been reduced to crumbs.

Note: If you need bread crumbs and haven't got a few days to wait for
the bread to get hard, cut the bread into cubes and bake at 250Ã¸F for
45 minutes to 1 hour. Process as you would stale bread.
