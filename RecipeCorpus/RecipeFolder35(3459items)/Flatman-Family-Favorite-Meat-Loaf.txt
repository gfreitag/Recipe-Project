Title: Flatman Family Favorite Meat Loaf
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
2 pk Italian dressing mix; dry
2 ea Garlic cloves; minced
1 ts Dry mustard
1 sm Onion; minced
1 lb Ground Pork
1 lb Ground Turkey
2 lb Lean Ground Beef
1 c  Sourdough bread crumbs
-fresh
Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Place in baking dish. Bake 2
hours at 300 degrees F.

Or can place in bottom of crockpot in the morning and forget about it
until dinner time.

Serve with potatoes, vegetable and your favorite gravy if desired.

I usually put potatoes in the same dish as the meat loaf when I bake
it and it depends on my mood whether I have gravy with it or not.
Leftovers make fantastic meat loaf sandwiches (if any is leftover!).
