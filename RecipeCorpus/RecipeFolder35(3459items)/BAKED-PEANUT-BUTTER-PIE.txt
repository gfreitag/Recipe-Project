Title: BAKED PEANUT BUTTER PIE
Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
3    Egg; slightly beaten
1/2 c  Peanut butter, creamy
1    Pie shell, 9"; unbaked
1 c  Karo, dark
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla
Blend the corn syrup, sugar, vanilla, eggs, and peanut butter and
pour into the unbaked crust. Bake in a 400 degree oven 15 minutes,
then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking 30 to
35 minutes more. The center should look "wobbly"; it will set as the
pie cools. Submitted By SAM WARING   On   09-25-95
