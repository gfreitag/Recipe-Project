"French crullers are made in a round shape with a cream-puff batter,
fried in deep fat, and have a thin icing." - Helen Jolly

Combine sugar, salt, shortening, and boiling water in a saucepan. Mix,
and bring to a rapid boil. Add flour all at once, and mix and cook
until thickened, stirring constanyly.
Remove from heat. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating thoroughly after each
addition. Add vanilla.

Force mixture through a pastry tube onto greased paper, forming
circles. Heat deep fat to 375`F. on frying thermometer. Carefully
turn paper upside down so crullers will drop into fat. Fry until
golden brown. Spread with thin Confectioners' Sugar Frosting.
Makes about 1 dozen.

Dash of salt

1/4 t vanilla extract

in sugar, or enough sugar to make frosting of spreading consistency.
