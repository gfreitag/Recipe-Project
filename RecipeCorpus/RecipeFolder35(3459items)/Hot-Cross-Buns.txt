Combine all the dough ingredients except the raisins in the machine's
bread pan. Turn the machine on RISE setting. Add the raisins after 12
mins or when the machine signals. After the dough has risen, shape
the dough into 12 balls. Arrange the balls 2 inches apart on a baking
sheet coated with cooking spray; flatten them slightly. Cover and let
them rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk; about 45 to 60 mins.
Brush the tops with egg white glaze or skim milk. Bake at 375 F for
10 to 12 mins, or until tops are light golden brown. While warm,
combine icing ingredients, and draw a cross on top of each bun with
icing. This recipe makes 12 buns.
