Bright with red and green peppers, this recipe is a good way to use
cucumbers that grew too big to pickle. The recipe makes about six 1
pint jars. You will need all the basic equipment plus a large mixing
bowl and a cheesecloth spice bag.

1. Organize ingredients, equipment, and work area.

2. Scrub cucumbers and cut off stem and blossom end.

3. Chop cucumbers. Stem, seed, and chop peppers. You should have 2
quarts chopped cucumbers and 2 cups of each color of chopped peppers.
Combine them with onion in a large mixing bowl; sprinkle the
vegetables with turmeric.

4. Dissolve salt in 2 quarts cold water; pour over vegetables. Let
stand for 3 to 4 hours.

5. Drain vegetables thoroughly. Cover them again with cold water and
let stand another hour. Drain well.

6. tie the spices in a cheesecloth bag and put in a large preserving
kettle with the vinegar and sugar. Heat to boiling, then pour over
the vegetables. Cover and set aside in a cool place for several hours
or overnight.

7. Slowly heat the vegetables and syrup to boiling, then pack relish
into hot jars to within 1/4 inch of tops. Run a slim, non metal tool
down along insides of jars to release any air bubbles. Add additional
relish, if necessary, to bring to within 1/4 inch of tops.

8. Wipe tops and threads of the jars with a damp clean cloth.

9. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

10. Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Follow basic
steps for boiling water bath canning, 10 through 18.
