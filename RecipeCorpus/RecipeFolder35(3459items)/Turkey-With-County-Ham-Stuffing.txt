Yield: 16 servings
2 c  Chopped celery

1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Pepper
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth

3 c  Bread cubes -- white

Place bread cubes in a single layer in a 13x9x2 inch baking pan. Bake
at 325 deg. for 20 to 25 min. or until golden, stirring occasionally.
Place in a large bowl; set aside. In a large skillet, cook ham in
butter for 5 to 10 min. or until edges are crisp. Remve with a
slotted spoon and place over bread cubes. In the same skillet, saute
the onion, celery, sage, thyme and pepper until vegetables are
tender; toss with bread and ham. Stir in enough broth to moisten.
Just before baking, stuff the turkey. Skewer openings; tie drumsticks
together. Place on a rack in a roasting. Bake at 325 deg. for 4 1/2

begins to brown, cover lightly with a tent of aluminum foil and
baster if needed. Remove all stuffing. Yield 10 to 12 servings.

baking dish at 325 deg. for 70 min. (uncover for the last wo min.).
