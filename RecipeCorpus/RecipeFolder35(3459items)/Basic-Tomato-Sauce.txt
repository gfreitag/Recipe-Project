Title: Basic Tomato Sauce
Categories: Tomatoes
Yield: 3 cups
1 cn (35oz) Italian tomatoes or
3 lb Tomatoes, peeled and seeded
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 tb Olive oil
1 md Leek (abt 1 1/4 cups)
-white and green parts
-cleaned and chopped
2    Garlic clove(s), minced
1. Heat the oil in a deep skillet. Add the leek and garlic, and saut
over low heat for 5 minutes or until the leek is wilted.

2. Empty the tomatoes with their liquid into a bowl. Squish the
tomatoes thoroughly (use your hands if you like).

3. Add the tomatoes, sugar, salt and pepper to the leek and stir to
combine.

4. Bring the sauce to a simmer over high heat. Turn the heat to low
and simmer uncovered until the sauce is reduced by half, about 25-35
minutes. (The wider the skillet, the less time it takes to reduce.)

Keeps stored in covered glass jars, for up to 1 week in the
refrigerator, 3 months in the freezer.

Note: When you use canned tomatoes, add a few chopped fresh ones, too.
Cherry tomatoes or plum tomatoes work well. If you're using all fresh
tomatoes, dice them and add about « cup water, more or less,
depending on the juiciness of the tomatoes.
