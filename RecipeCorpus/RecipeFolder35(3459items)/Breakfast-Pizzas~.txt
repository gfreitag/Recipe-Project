Categories: Low cal/fat, Breakfast, Pizza
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Chopped onion
3/4 c  Chopped sweet red pepper
1/2 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
1/4 c  Nonfat mayonnaise
1/4 ts Curry powder
3/4 c  (3 oz) Shredded part-skim
-mozzarella cheese
Baking Time:  15 min. Reheating Time: 20 min.
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water (105~ to 115~)
2 ts Canola oil
3/4 c  Unbleached flour
1/2 c  Rye flour
4 oz (85% lean) ground beef
1 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
Prep Time:  38 min.
(opt) Microwave Time:  3 min. (opt)

In a small bowl, stir together the yeast, water and oil. Let stand
for 10 minutes.

Using a spoon, stir in the unbleached flour and enough of the rye
flour to make a smooth, moderately stiff dough. (If the dough becomes
too difficult to stir with the spoon, use your hands to knead in
enough of the remaining rye flour to make the dough smooth and
moderately stiff.) Divide the dough into quarters and shape into
smooth balls. Cover the balls with a clean towel and let rest for 10
minutes.

Meanwhile, spray an unheated large skillet with no-stick spray. Heat
skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef, mushrooms, onion and
pepper and cook about 8 minutes or until the meat is browned and the
vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally to break up the meat.
Drain the beef mixture in a strainer or colander, then transfer it to
a large plate lined with 3 layers of paper towels. Blot the top of
the mixture with additional paper towels. Set the mixture aside.

Spray 2 cookie sheets with no-stick spray. On the cookie sheets, pat
each ball of dough into a 6" circle, building up the edges. Bake at
425~ for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise and
curry powder. Spread on the hot crusts and sprinkle with the meat
mixture and cheese. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes more or until the
cheese is melted and the pizzas are heated through. Serve hot or
transfer the pizzas to wire racks and cool completely.

To store:  Individually wrap each pizza in freezer wrap and freeze
until ready to serve.

To serve:  Thaw overnight in the regrigerator.

Remove freezer wrap and wrap each pizza in foil. Bake at 350~ about 20
minutes or until heated through.

Or unwrap each thawed pizza and place on a microwave-proof plate.
Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Reheat in microwave on medium power
(50%) for 1 1/2 minutes. Rotate the plate a half-turn and heat on
medium about 1 1/2 minutes more.

NOTE:  If you forget to thaw the pizzas ahead of time, give them an
extra 10 minutes or so in the oven. Or increase the microwave time of
each pizza to 5 minutes; rotate the pizza a half-turn after 2 minutes.

Makes 4 servings.
