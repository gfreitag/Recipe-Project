Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 recipe
2 tb (total) fresh herbs
-(oregano, thyme, lemon
-balm, etc.)
1 c  To 1-1/2  cups dry white
-wine
1/2 c  To 1 cup Italian bread
-crumbs
2 tb Fresh parsley, chopped
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
-and/or butter
1 md Onion, quartered and
-sliced
2    To 3 cloves garlic,
-chopped
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1 lb Chicken liver
In a pan over medium heat, heat/melt olive oil and/or butter (I
prefer a cast-iron pan).  Add the onion and cook until they begin to
be transparent. Add the garlic and cook for another 5 minutes.
Increase the heat to medium-high and add the chicken stock, herbs,
and livers.

Cook until the livers begin to brown and are almost cooked to your
taste. Add the white wine and cook it down until only about 1/2 cup
remains. Add the parsley.  While stirring the livers, add the bread
crumbs a little at a time until the liquid combines with the crumbs
to form a sauce.
