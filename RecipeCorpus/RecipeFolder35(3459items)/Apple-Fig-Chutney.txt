1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Cider vinegar
2 tb Candied ginger
-finely chopped
1    Garlic clove(s), minced

2 1/2 c  Dried figs

2 tb Lemon juice
6    Cloves
6    Allspice berries
6    Blades of mace or
1/4 ts Grated nutmeg
1. Plump the figs and raisins in the cider for 15 minutes. Toss the
apple with the lemon juice to prevent browning. Tie the cloves,
allspice berries, mace, cinnamon stick, and lemon zest in a square of
cheesecloth or aluminum foil perforated with a fork.

2. Combine the fig, raisins, apple, spice bag, brown sugar, vinegar,
ginger, garlic, chili powder, salt and pepper, and cayenne in a large
nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer,
covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover the pot and continue simmering for
another 30 minutes, or until thick and richly flavored. If the
chutney becomes too dry, add a little more cider.

3. Correct the seasoning, adding brown sugar, vinegar, or cayenne to
taste. The chutney should be highly seasoned. Transfer the chutney to
sterile canning jars. Invert the jars for 10 minutes, then reinvert
and let cool. The chutney will keep for several months, unopened, in
a cool, dark place. Refrigerate once opened.
