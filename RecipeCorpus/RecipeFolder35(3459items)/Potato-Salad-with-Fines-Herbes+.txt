Categories: Salads, Potatoes

For a real switch from what Grandma used to make (which was good in
its own right), try this alternative potato salad.

1. Put the potaotes in a kettle and add cold water to cover and salt
to taste. bring to the boil and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove from the heat and drain.

2. As soon as the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them. Cut
them into 1/4" thick slices and put them in a mixing bowl.

3. Add the shallots, garlic, chives, parsley, tarragon, wine vinegar,
oil, salt and pepper to taste. Toss well. Garnish with heart of
Romaine lettuce or other greens.

NOTE: Walnut oil is available in specialty shops that deal in fine
imported foods
