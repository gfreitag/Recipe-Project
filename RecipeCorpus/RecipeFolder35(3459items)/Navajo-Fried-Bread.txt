Title: Navajo Fried Bread
Categories: Breads, Information, Amerindian
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Lard or shortening
3/4 c  Lukewarm water, approx.
Oil for frying
Makes 6 rounds
2 c  White flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
In a medium-size bowl mix the dry ingredients, stirring thoroughly.
With the tips of your fingers or with a pastry blender cut in lard or
shortening until mixture has the texture of corn meal. Slowly add the
water, stirring with a fork, using just enough liquid for the dough
to hold together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead
gently for about 3 minutes. Cover it with a piece of plastic wrap or
towel and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Divide the dough into six
round balls and let these rest, lightly covered, while you start
heating the fat in a frying kettle or electric fryer or skillet. Roll
out the first ball of dough to a round 6 to 7 inches in diameter.
Make a 3-inch cut down the center of the circle with a sharp knife.
By now the fat should be hot; if you have a deep-frying fat
thermometer test its temperature - it should be about 380 F; if you
don't, test with a small pinch of the dough - it should sizzle and
float to the top but not darken too quickly. When ready, slip the
first round of dough into the hot fat.  It will puff up immediately;
cook it on one side for a minute or so, then turn it with a slotted
spatula and cook on the other. Remove and drain on paper towels and
prepare the next round of dough. Watch the fat to make sure it stays
hot enough but doesn't start to smoke. The fried bread may be kept
warm in a low oven, but it should be eaten as soon as possible,
either strewn with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, chilies, cheese, and
hot sausage, if you like, or it can be eaten with honey and sprinkled
with confectioner's sugar. The Book of Bread From the collection of
