Title: Basil Walnut Vinaigrette
Categories: Salads, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
Salt and pepper
1 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Walnut pieces
1 tb Dijon mustard
1/3 c  Red wine vinegar
3/4 c  Basil leaves -- coarsely
-chopped
Combine the mustard, vinegar, and basil in the bowl of a food
processor fitted with a steel blade, and season to taste with salt
and pepper. Process for 1 minute, shut off motor, scrape down sides
of bowl, and process for 30 seconds longer.  Leave the motor running
and dribble in the oil in a slow, steady stream.  When the oil is
incorporated, drop the walnuts through the feed tube and shut machine
off immediately.  Check texture of walnuts, they should be chopped
evenly and fairly finely, but should still be discernible in the
dressing.  Process with short bursts of power until you achieve the
desired texture.  Do not overprocess.  Cover and refrigerate.
