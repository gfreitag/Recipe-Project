Title: Route 66 Cinnamon Rolls
Categories: Pastry, Route 66
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Brown Sugar
1 tb Cinnamon
4 tb Flour
1/3 c  Margarine
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Pecans -- chopped
1 tb Milk Or Light Cream
5 c  Flour
1 pk Dry Yeast
1 c  Milk
1/3 c  Margarine
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3    Eggs
In large mixing bowl, combine half the flour and the yeast. In a
saucepan heat the milk with margarine, sugar, and salt until
margarine has melted. Add to flour mixture. Add eggs and beat with
electric mixer for about 4 mins. Stir in remaining flour.

Turn dough out on floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic,
3 to 5 mins. Shape into ball, place in greased bowl and let rise in
warm place until double, about 1 hour. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon
and flour. Cut in margarine until crumbly. Set aside.

Punch down dough, turn out on lightly floured surface and roll into a
12-inch square. Sprinkle filling over dough; top with raisins and
pecans and roll up, pinching edges to seal. Slice into eight 1
1/2-inch rolls. Arrange, cut side up, in a greased 13 x 9 x 2-inch
baking pan. Cover and let rise again until nearly double. Brush dough
lightly with milk and bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 25 mins or
until lightly browned. Brush again with milk or cream and remove from
pan to cool on wire rack. Drizzle powdered sugar glaze on top if
desired. Serve warm.

Makes 8 large rolls.
