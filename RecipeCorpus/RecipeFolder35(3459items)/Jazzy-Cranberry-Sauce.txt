A great sauce to keep or give away!  Must be refrigerated.  Pour
over low-fat cream cheese and serve with crackers, or serve sauce
with pork or turkey tenderloin for holiday meals.  Or place in jars
and tie with a big bow.

Combine water, sugar, and brown sugar in medium saucepan; stir well.
Bring to boil over medium heat; add cranberries.

Return to boil and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Spoon into bowl; let cool to room temp.

Stir in horseradish and mustard.  Cover and chill.

Sylvia's comments: It was WONDERFUL poured over cream cheese!  When I
tried to make it at home, the recipe called for twice as much water as
now, and even after cooking, it was more like cranberry soup.  I
boiled away for another hour and it was STILL soupy, so I added more
cranberries and sugar and boiled a little longer.  Don't worry that
the berries still look whole after 10 minutes and it's very
soupy-looking, it will thicken as it cools.  For shrivelled berries,
cook longer.
