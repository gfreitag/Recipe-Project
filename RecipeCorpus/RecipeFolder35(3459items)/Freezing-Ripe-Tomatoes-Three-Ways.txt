1. Choose ripe, firm, red tomatoes, free of blemishes.

wrap or small plastic bag, then freeze. To use in cooked dishes, run
under lukewarm water for a few seconds to loosen skin, then remove
skin and blossom end. Add tomato, along with other ingredients, and
cook.

STEWED: Dip whole, washed tomatoes in boiling water 2 minutes to
loosen skins. Peel and core. Cut in quarters or pieces; simmer 10 to
20 minutes or until tender. Cool. Pack in containers, leaving 1/4
inch head space. Seal, label, and freeze.

PUREED: Peel tomatoes as for stewed tomatoes. Core and cut them in
quarters into a blender container. For each 4 medium tomatoes, add
1/2 onion, chopped; 1 green pepper, seeded, stemmed, and cut in
quarters; 1 tablespoon salt; 1 tablespoon sugar. Blend on low or
medium speed until onion and pepper are chopped. Pack the puree in
containers, leaving 1/4 inch head space for pints, 1/2 inch for
quarts. Seal, label and freeze.
