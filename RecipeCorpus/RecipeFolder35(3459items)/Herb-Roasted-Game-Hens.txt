Title: Herb-Roasted Game Hens
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper
4    Cornish game hens
-(abt 1 1/4 lb ea)
1 sm Onion or shallot, quartered
8    Sprigs rosemary or thyme
8 lg Garlic clove(s), peeled
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Herbs, chopped
-(rosemary, basil, thyme,
-oregano, chives, parsley)
1 tb Lemon juice
-or to taste
Combine the garlic and chicken stock in a saucepan and gently simmer,
covered, for 20 minutes, or until the garlic is soft. Let cool. Pure
the garlic and stock with the herbs in a food mill or blender. Work
in the lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper/ The mixture should be
highly seasoned.

Remove any lumps of fat from inside the birds. Season the cavities
with salt and pepper and place an onion quarter in each. STarting at
the neck of each bird, work your finger under the skin to create a
pocket between the skin and the breast meat. Try to loosen the skin
over the breast, thighs, and drumsticks. Work carefully so as not to
tear the skin.

Preheat the oven to 400øF. Spread 1 tbs herb mixture under the skin
of each bird. (This is most easily done with a small spoon.) Tightly
truss each bird with string, tucking sprigs of rosemary or thyme
between the legs. Season the outside of the birds with salt and
pepper, and brush with the remaining herb mixture.

Roast the birds on a rack in a roasting pan for 40 minutes, or until
golden brown and juices run clear when pricked. Transfer to a platter
and let stand for 3 minutes. If desired, removed the skin before
serving. Remove the trussing string and serve at once.
