From Sarah Pepper:

Saves a lot of clean up.  I think a person could even cut down a
little on the oil and maybe add a little more milk - it depends
on how flaky you like it.  I made it just like the recipe calls
for and it turned out well.

Makes pastry for a single crust 8 or 9 inch pie

"Quick, crisp but tender, it needs no rolling out.  This recipe
can only be used for one crust pies.--you can't double the recipe
and roll out a top crust."

Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the pie pan and mix with your
fingers until blended.  In a measuring cup, combine the oil and
milk and beat with a fork until creamy.  Pour all at once over
the flour mixture.  Mix with a fork until the flour mixture is
completly moistened.  Pat the dough with your fingers, first up
the sides of the plate, then across the bottom.  Flute the edges.

Shell is now ready to be filled.  If you are preparing a shell to
fill later, or your recipe requires a prebaked crust, preheat the
oven to 425 degrees.  Prick the surface of the pastry with a fork
and bake 15 mins, checking often, and pricking more if needed.
