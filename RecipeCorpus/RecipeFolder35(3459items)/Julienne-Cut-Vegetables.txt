You might think that fine touches such as julienne-cut vegetables are
just for show, but in fact they do have their practical place in the
kitchen as well. It's always a good idea to cut vegetables in evenly
sized pieces so that they cook evenly. Otherwise, smaller pieces can
become overcooked and soft before larger pieces are done. In
addition, julienne-cut vegetable in fine, slender "sticks" are very
quick cooking and maintain the texture and flavor of the vegetable.

To cut julienne strips, first trim the vegetable to about 3-inch
lengths, then cut across into ¬-inch slices. Cut the slices
lengthwise into ¬-inch strips. More pronounced ingredients such as
ginger or garlic should be cut in finer julienne, about 1-inch long
and 1/16-inch wide.
