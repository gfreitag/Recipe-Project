"Jerking" is an ancient Jamaican method for preserving and cooking
meat, thought to have been invented by Arawak Indians. Today, the men
who prepare and sell the meat are called "jerk men." This mini-kabob,
with all the attributes of jerk seasoning--heat, saltiness and
sweetness--can be served hot or at room temperature. EATING WELL
