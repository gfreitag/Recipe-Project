Sausages are basic mixtures of meat, fat, spices and liquid.  You can
utilize cheaper and tougher cuts ++ beef round, chuck  or brisket,
pork shoulder, or rib (blade) end of the loin, lamb shoulder and veal
shoulder or breast, because they will be tenderized by grinding
Unless I am making fish sausage, or fine-grained 'boudin', I prefer a
grinder with a sharp knife to a food processor.  Quick as the
processor is, it chops unevenly and heats up the meat, giving the
sausage a pasty texture. Preground meat is not recommended.

Depending on the leanness of the meat, an additional 30-50% fat - pork
fatback, or leaf lard, beef or lamb suet, and on occasion, poultry
fat - is added to moisten, tenderize and bind the sausage. Every herb
or spice finds itself in the middle of these mixtures at one time or
another, but a blend of white peppercorns, cloves, nutmeg, giner or
cinnamon appears so regularly, that connoisseurs mix up their own
secret proportions. Pork casings are the most practical for all but
large, country-style sausages, which require the thicker beef
casings. Stick with half dolls (7-1/2 yds). enough for ten pounds of
meat. Anything larger is difficult to handle. Packed in salt, natural
casings last at least a year in the refrigerator. You can usually
obtain casings from your local butcher. Shared by: Bobbie Kopf,
