Ground white pepper TO TASTE
1/2 c  To 3/4 cup macadamia nuts;

To toast macadamia nuts, spread nuts in one lager in a baking pan.
Place pan in a preheated 325 F oven and roast, stirring once or
twice, until nuts are lightly toasted golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Set nuts aside to cool. When they are cool, finely chop half the nuts
and coarsely chop the remaining half.  Keep the coarsely and the
finely chopped nuts separated, and set nuts aside.

To make dressing, combine mayonnaise, cream, vinegar, sugar, salt,
pepper and finely chopped nuts.  Refrigerate dressing in a covered
container until ready to use.  Just before serving, stir in coarsely
chopped nuts. Serve over lettuce or fruit salads.
