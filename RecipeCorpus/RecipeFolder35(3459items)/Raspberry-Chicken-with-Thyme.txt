Title: Raspberry Chicken with Thyme
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Butter, cut into pieces
1 ts Olive oil
1/3 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
1    Shallot, minced
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1 1/2 c  Raspberries
8    Thyme sprigs plus
1 ts Thyme, minced
4    Chicken breast halves
-boneless, with skin
Salt and pepper to taste
1. Press half of the raspberries through a fine stainless steel
strainer; reserve the puree.

2. Tuck one thyme sprig under the skin of each chicken breast,
loosening the skin as little as possible. Season the chicken with
salt and pepper.

2. In a large, heavy, nonreactive skillet, melt « tsp of the butter
in the oil over high heat. When the butter stops foaming, add the
chicken, skin side down, and cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to
moderate and cook until the skin is nicely browned, about 5 minutes
longer. Turn the chicken and brown the second side, about 6 minutes.
Transfer the chicken to a plate and keep warm in a low oven. Pour the
fat from the skillet.

3. Add the wine, vinegar, shallot and minced thyme to the skillet and
boil over moderately high heat for 2 minutes, stirring to deglaze the
pan. Add the chicken stock and boil until reduced to ¬ cup, about 5
minutes. Stir in the reserved raspberry puree and cook until warmed
through. Remove from the heat and whisk in the remaining 2« tbs
butter.

4. Slice the chicken breasts crosswise or leave them whole. Transfer
to warmed plates and spoon the sauce on top or alongside. Garnish
with the remaining thyme sprigs and whole raspberries and serve.
