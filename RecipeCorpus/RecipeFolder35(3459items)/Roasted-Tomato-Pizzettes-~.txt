smooth. 3. Transfer the pureed tomatoes to a nonstick skillet. Add
the sundried tomatoes, red pepper, sugar, salt and pepper. Cover and
simmer over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens, about 20 to
30 mins. 4. Meanwhile, lower the oven temperature to 250 F. Core the
reamining 4 tomatoes and cut them crosswise into twenty-four 1/4-inch
slices. Brush a baking sheet with olive oil, spread the tomato slices
on the sheet, and bake until almost dry, about 2 hours. 5. Raise the
oven temperature to 425 F. Shape the pizza dough as in step 4 of the
Basic Pizza Dough recipe. Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on
top. Arrange the tomato slices in a circle on each pizza and sprinkle
