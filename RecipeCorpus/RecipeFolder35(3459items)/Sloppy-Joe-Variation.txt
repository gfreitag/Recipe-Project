Title: Sloppy Joe Variation
Categories: Meats
Yield: 5 servings
2 tb Mustard, any style
1/2 c  Ketchup
Salt/pepper to taste
1 1/2 lb Ground beef or turkey
2    Cans Chicken Gumbo soup
1 sm Onion
1 tb Lemon juice
Brown the meat with the onions, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Pour
the liquid ingredients over the drained meat.  Makes an interesting
new flavor for a quick supper.  This sort of soup seems to vary in
moisture levels, so you might get juicier or dryer meat from batch to
batch. Submitted By CRAIG SCHROEDER   On   10-25-95
