Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 lb Butter; plus
2 tb Shortening
2 tb Vanilla
2 tb Baking powder
4    Eggs; to 6
2 c  Sugar
2 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
Beat eggs and sugar until light.  Sieve flour three or four times
before measuring.  Add baking powder to flour and sieve.  Add to
batter half at a time.  Boil together butter and milk and while
boiling pour over batter. Add vanilla last.

If you have an electric mixer you won't have to beat so much.
