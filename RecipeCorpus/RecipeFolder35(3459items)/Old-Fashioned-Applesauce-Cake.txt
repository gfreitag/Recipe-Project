sugar together, in a large mixing bowl, until light and fluffy, using
an electric mixer set on medium speed.  Add the eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.  Add the dry ingredients
alternately with the applesauce and the water, blending well with the
mixer set on low speed.  Stir in the raisins and nuts.  Pour the
batter into a greased 13 X 9 X 2-inch baking pan. Bake in a preheated
350 Degree F. oven for 45 minutes or until a cake tester or wooden
pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool, until cold to the
touch, in the pan on a wire rack.  Dust the cake with Confectioners'
sugar. Submitted By ROBERT MILES   On   09-30-95
