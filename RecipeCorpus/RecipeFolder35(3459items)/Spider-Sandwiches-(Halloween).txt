Categories: Sandwich, Holiday, Kids
Yield: 1 servings
Licorice
Cheetos
Bread
Peanut butter
Raisins
Take bread and spread peanut butter on each slice and cut into a
circle. On top place two raisins for eyes and if you want a nose you
can use a raisin for that also.
Use licorice for whiskers (black or chocolate).
Use cheetos for the 8 legs and there you go a nice treat before
trick or treat.
