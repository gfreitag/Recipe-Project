Title: Ranch-Style Flavored Oyster Crackers
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 50 servings
Salad dressing
1 ts Dill weed
1 ts Garlic powder
2 pk Oyster crackers
1 pk Orville Reddenbacker butter-
Flavored popcorn oil*
1 pk Dry Hidden Valley Ranch
Using a wisk, blend oil, dry Ranch dressing and seasonings.  Place
crackers in a large bowl (one with a tight-fitting lid).  Pour
blended oil mixture over crackers.

Mix crackers with a spatula, folding crackers to thoroughly coat them
with the oil mixture.  When crackers are coated, place the lid on the
bowl.

Every hour, rotate the bowl (roll the bowl over a complete turn).  Do
NOT shake or stir.  Let the crackers sit overnight, rotate once more
before eating, then enjoy.

Expensive oyster crackers seem to be too hard and won't allow the oil
mixture to seep into them.  Get the cheap bags of crackers that say
"Soup and Chili" crackers on them.

*  IMPORTANT

Also, the one "package" of oil is really a bottle of oil.  Couldn't
find bottle in the choices MM offered. Submitted By MIKE BARON On
