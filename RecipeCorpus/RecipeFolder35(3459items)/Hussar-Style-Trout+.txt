Categories: Fish/seafoo, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/8 ts Ground black pepper
Salt to taste
1    Egg, beaten
6    Trout, dressed, 1/2 lb. each
3/4 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Flour
3 tb Chopped onions
6 tb Butter
1 c  Sliced onion
3 c  Soft breadcrumbs
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 ts Dried thyme leaves

Cook chopped onion in 2 tb. of the butter until onion is transparent.
Transfer the cooked onion to a mixing bowl. In the same skillet add 2
more tb. of the butter and the sliced onion. Cook until the onions are
transparent, then place them in the bottom of a baking pan. Soak the
bread crumbs in the milk, squeeze them dry, fluff them up with a
fork, and add to the chopped onion. Stir in the seasonings and beaten
egg. Spoon into the body cavities of the trout. Close openings with
toothpick. Place in a preheated moderate oven (350 degrees) and bake
25 to 30 minutes or until the fish flakes when tested with a fork.
Pour off stock into a saucepan and boil down to one-half. Blend flour
with the remaining 2 tb. butter and add to the stock. Mix well and
cook for 1/2 minute. Seaon with salt and pepper to taste. Pour over
the trout. Glaze quickly under broiler heat.

I found this recipe in "Modern French Culinary Art" by Henri-Paul
Pellaprat. I used the recipe and it really did taste like french
cooking. The herbs, the butter, the sauce. It was delightful.
