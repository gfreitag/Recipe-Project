Title: Caramels II
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ea Stick (4 Tbsp) butter
3/4 c  Evaporated milk, scalded
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
Makes 1 1/4 pounds
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
2 tb Water
In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water. Stir
over moderate heat unitl the mixtureboils and becomes clear. Wash
down the sugar crystals on the sides of the pan with a wet brush.
Boil the syrup over high heat until its temperature reaches 250 F on
a candy-jelly thermometer. Stir in the butter, a tablespoon at a
time. Turn the heat down to moderate and add the evaporated milk
gradually - in about six parts - boiling and stirring constantly
until each addition is thoroughly incorporated. Continue boiling the
syrup, stirring often, until the thermometer registers 245 F (the
temperature will have dripped with the addition of the milk); this
usually takes about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the
vanilla and salt. Cool for 2 minutes. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Pour the caramel mixture onto the sheet, placed on a rack. As the
candy begins to cool down - in about 5 minutes - form it into a
7-inch square with a buttered spatula or your hands.  Cool until firm
throughout, about an hour. Place the candy on a board and cut it into
eight strips, using a sharp, serrated knife and cutting with a rapid
sawing motion (cut in any other fashion, the caramels will stick
together). Separate the strips as you cut the.  Cut each strip into
eight pieces, again separating the pieces as you cut them apart.
Immediately wrap each square in plastic or waxed paper. Pack
airtight; the caramels will keep for months. Better Than Store-Bought
