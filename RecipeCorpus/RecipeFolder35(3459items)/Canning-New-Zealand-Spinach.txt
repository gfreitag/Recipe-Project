Title: Canning New Zealand Spinach
Categories: Can/preserv, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
2 lb To 6 lb; Makes 1 quart
You'll need all the basic equipment, plus a large saucepan. This
recipe is for the hot pack method only.

1. Choose freshly picked, young and tender spinach.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Wash spinach thoroughly in several changes of water and pick over
carefully.

4. Cut out any tough stems and mid ribs.

5. Put spinach in large saucepan with just enough water to prevent
sticking (usually the water that clings to the leaves is enough).
Heat just until spinach is wilted, turning spinach when steam begins
to rise around the edges of pan. Before packing, cut through spinach
several times with a sharp knife or kitchen scissors.

6. Pack hot spinach very loosely into hot pint or quart jars to
within 1 inch of tops. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar, 1
teaspoon to each quart, if desired. Pour in boiling water to within 1
inch of tops.

8. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

9. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

10. Process at 10 pound pressure, 1 hour and 10 minutes for pints, 1
hour and 30 minutes for quarts.

11. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
