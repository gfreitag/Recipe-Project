Title: Uno's Deep Pan Chicago Style Pizza (Janice Norman)
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 c  Coarse ground cornmeal
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Oil
1 c  Warm tap water -- (110-115
Deg)
1 pk Active dry yeast
3 1/2 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2    Garlic cloves -- minced
3 ts Dried oregano -- -or-
5    Fresh basil leaves, shredded
4 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
Cheese
1 lb Mozzarella -- sliced
1 lb Sausage, removed from the
Casing -- crumbled
28 oz Can whole tomatoes, drained,
-coarsly crushed
Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the
yeast with a fork. Add 1 c of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and
vegetable oil. Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest
of the flour 1/2 c at a time, until the dough comes away from the
sides of the bowl. Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed
the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.

Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45
to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk. Punch it
down and kneed it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish
pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches up the sides and is even on the
bottom of the pan. Let the dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Cook the crumbled
sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of its excess fat. Drain
and chop the tomatoes.

When the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese
over the dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over
the cheese. Top with the tomatoes. Sprinkle on the seasonings and
parmesan cheese.

Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400
degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a
section of the crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its
color. The crust will be golden brown when done. Serve immediately.
