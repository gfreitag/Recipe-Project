Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Brown sugar
1 tb Olive oil
1 ts Sliced ginger root
2    Starfruit -- sliced
Crosswise
2 oz Rum
12 lg Shrimp
2    Lemons -- zested and juiced

STEP ONE: The zest is the colored part of the lemon and lime rind.
Use a vegetable peeler to remove it, then chop it finely.

STEP TWO: Peel shrimp and butterfly by cutting lengthwise so that
shrimp open like a book and lie almost flat. Don't cut them in half.

STEP THREE: Combine lemon and lime zest, jalapeno, and white
peppercorns and set aside.

STEP FOUR: Combine lemon and lime juice with brown sugar in a small
saucepan and simmer until 3 tablespoons are left. Add the salt and
zest mixture. Cook for one more minute and remove from heat. Moisten
with 1 tablespoon olive oil and let cool.

STEP FIVE: Press the mixture onto both sides of the butterflied
shrimp, then sear in olive oil. Cook for one minute, then add the
starfruit and ginger. Add the rum, swirl it around in the pan for a
few seconds, and serve.
