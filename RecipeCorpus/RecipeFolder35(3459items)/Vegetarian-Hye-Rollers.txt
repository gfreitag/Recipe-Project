Place chopped cucumber in colander in sink and sprinkle lightly with
salt. Let drain for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, prepare dressing and
vegetables. To make dressing, in small bowl, stir together tahini, 3
tbsp water, lemon juice, garlic, and salt to taste.  It will be as
thick as mayonaise. (Dressing may be refrigerated up to 1 week.)  To
prepare vegetables, squeeze cucumbers dry in a clean towel.  Add
green onions, radishes and tomatoes and squeeze gently to remove
excess liquid.  If not using immediately, refrigerate in towel until
ready to assemble sandwiches or up to 6 hours.  Transfer to a bowl
and toss together.  To make sandwiches, split pita to make 2 flat
rounds.  If they are not soft and pliable, place on a plate, cover
with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 30 to 50 seconds.  Spread
each round with 2 tbsp dressing.  Spread a layer or vegetables and
peperoncini down the center.  Sprinkle with cheese and roll up
tightly.  Repeat with other pitas.  Wrap in plastic wrap and
refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours before serving.  Cut
each sandwich in half to serve.  387 calories and 16 grams fat.
