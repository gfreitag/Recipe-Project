Other cheeses, such as smoked Cheddar, can be substituted for the
extra-sharp Cheddar. For blue-cheese lovers, substitute 1/4 pound blue
cheese for the same amount of Cheddar.

In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add ham and simmer for 30
seconds. Remove from heat, drain well and discard water. Set ham
aside. Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish with vegetable oil. Layer
one-fourth of the potatoes on the bottom of the dish. Distribute
one-third of the ham over the potatoes. Repeat the layers in the same
manner until all of the potatoes and ham have been used. The top
layer should be potatoes. Preheat oven to 350~.
In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and let mixture
bubble, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Gradually add milk and
cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens, 4 to 5 minutes longer.
Remove from heat and stir in cheese, mustard, cayenne pepper and salt
and pepper to taste. Return pan to low heat and stir constantly just
until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour cheese sauce evenly over
potatoes and ham. Bake, uncovered, until potatoes can be easily
pierced with a skewer and are golden brown on top, about 1 hour.
Spoon casserole onto warmed plates and serve at once.
Serves 6 - 8.
