1. Char chilies over a gas flame or under a hot broiler, turning to
blacken all over. Place chilies in a brown paper bag and close
tightly for about 15 minutes. Remove and let cool. Peel off blackened
skin, taking care not to tear flesh. Cut a slit down the length of
each, stopping «-inch from the bottom. Scrape out ribs and seeds; set
chilies aside.

2. Cook onions, garlic, and apples in 2 tbs oil in a large skillet
over medium-low heat until soft, about 20 minutes. Add pork and cook
10 minutes; season with salt, stir in cinnamon and vinegar, and cook
5 minutes more.

3. Pure walnuts and sour cream in a food processor; add salt to
taste and set aside.

4. Dry chilies with paper towels and fill them with pork mixture.

5. Beat egg whites in a medium bowl until foamy. Add a pinch of salt;
continue to beat until stiff. Lightly beat yolk, then fold into
whites. Dredge chilies in flour, shake off excess, then dip in egg.
Fry in 1-inch very hot oil in a large skillet, turning to brown
evenly. Drain.

6. Cover chilies with sauce and garnish with cilantro and pomegranate
seeds. Serve at once.

Diane's Personal Note: Try this with red peppers and ground beef.
