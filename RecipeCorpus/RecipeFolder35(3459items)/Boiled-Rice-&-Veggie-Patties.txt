Title: Boiled Rice & Veggie Patties
Categories: Vegetables, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Parsley fresh
1/4 ts Ginger, ground
1 ts Coriander, ground
2 lg Egg white
1 tb Soy Sauce low sodium
1/8 ts Pepper
1 c  Carrot shredded
3/4 c  Rice brown cooked
1/2 c  Mozzarella, shredded
1/3 c  Onion chopped
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1/3 c  Dry roasted peanuts, crushed
Carrots must be finely shredded and onion finely chopped. I use a food
processor. Shred the mozzarella and crumble bread crumbs well. Put the
peanuts in a 1 gallon zip lock bag. Crush by using a rolling pin over
them repeatedly. In a large mixing bowl stir together the carrots,
cooled cooked rice, cheese, onions, peanuts, bread crumbs, parsley,
ginger, coriander and pepper. In a small bowl slightly beat the egg
whites then blend in the soy sauce. Add to the rice mixture and blend
well. Cover and chill in refrigerator for an hour or until firm
enough to handle. Shape the mixture into four 3/4 inch thick patties.
Spray a baking sheet with oil. Place patties on sheet. Broil four
inches from the heat for seven minutes. Turn and broil two minutes
more until set. Serve as you would a hamburger. I have done this in a
skillet but you must be careful handling the patties or they break
up. Be sure to let the first side get well done before trying to turn
them.  Helps to have frozen the patties for easy of handling before
cooking.
