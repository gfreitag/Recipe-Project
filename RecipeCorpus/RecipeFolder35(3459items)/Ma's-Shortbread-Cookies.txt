Title: Ma's Shortbread Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
3 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1/2 c  Corn starch
1 lb Butter
1 c  Icing sugar
Put butter and icing sugar in a bowl and beat for AT LEAST HALF AN
HOUR. Add
flour and corn starch; don't beat, knead until it starts to crack.
Use a cooky press or whatever you wish; bake the cookies at 350 F.
for about 11 minutes.  Cookies are done when golden brown around the
edges.

In this case "Ma" happens to be my wonderful mother who with my dad
kept their three sons fed, clothed, happy, and ignorant of the fact
that they were actually dirt poor by most people's standards while
they grew up.
