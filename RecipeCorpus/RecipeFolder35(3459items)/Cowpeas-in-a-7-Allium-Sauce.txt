Meanwhile, melt 2 tbs butter in a medium-size skillet and saut the
leeks, red onions and scallions over very low heat for 20 minutes.
stir frequently and do not brown. Set aside. When the garlic and
shallots are cooked, cool, then slip off skins. Discard the skins and
the thyme. Transfer the pulp to a medium-size bowl and mash with a
fork.

Return the reserved leek mixture to the heat, stir in the parsley,
garlic and shallot pure and the cream. Season with salt and pepper
and turn off the heat.

In a small non-stick skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of butter
and stir in the pearl onions. Sprinkle with the sugar and saut over

chicken stock and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer for
10-15 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Stir the  onion
mixture into the larger skillet, along with the cooked cowpeas and
vinegar. Sprinkle with the chives and serve hot, or cover with
aluminum foil and heat in the oven just before serving. Add ¬ cup of
chicken stock or water if the beans are to be reheated later, so they
will not be too dry.
