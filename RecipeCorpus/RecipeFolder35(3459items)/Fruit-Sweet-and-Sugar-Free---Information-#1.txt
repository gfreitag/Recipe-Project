The Ranch Kitchen Restaurant and Bakery
***************************************

Just north of Yellowstone National Park on Montana's
:
breathtaking Route 89 in the Paradise Valley is The Ranch Kitchen, a
log-cabin-style restaurant offering the best of Montana home cooking.
The Ranch Kitchen is in Corwin Springs, just eight miles
:
north of Gardiner, Montana, which is the northern entrance to
Yellowstone Park. Actually, along with the Cinnabar General Store
next door, The Ranch Kitchen is Corwin Springs. Built as a dude ranch
lodge in the twenties and expanded to include a large dance hall
during the thirties, the original building has been remodeled into a
cozy country restaurant housing a professional dinner theater.
Since it became The Ranch Kitchen in the summer of 1982, its
:
all-American breakfasts, hearty lunches, home-style dinners, and
elaborate theater buffets have made the restaurant a favorite of
local residents and park visitors.
The Ranch Kitchen's breads, muffins and desserts have become a
:
trademark of the restaurant. Many of the recipes developed that first
summer have been grand-prize and blue-ribbon winners at the local
county and state fairs. We still use those recipes today, along with
many new ones, and have since switched to fruit sweeteners for all of
our baked goods. No meal at The Ranch Kitchen is complete without
something from the bakery.
Each of the recipes presented has been developed and served
:
at The Ranch Kitchen. Guests are always asking, if, how, and when
they can have the recipe from the Very-Berry Syrup on their pancakes
to the apple butter on their toast, to the french bread with the
spaghetti to the carrot cake or pumpkin pie they had for dessert.
People always want to know how we do it, how we get our desserts to
taste and look so delicious without using refined white sugar.
Part of the answer stems from the standard of excellence held
:
by everyone at the restaurant. Our goal is to offer the best, and to
show that healthier food doesn't have to be heavy. We are always
working to produce lighter, better, and tastier pastries, sweets, and
breads, while lowering the content of sugar, fat, and cholesterol.
Throughout the years, as our techniques in the bakery
:
improved and our palates were refined, our offerings evolved. As we
studied more about healthier food and nutrition, we adapted out
recipes accordingly. The first year we used a lot of white and brown
sugars and dabbled with honey. Year two found us switching to
fructose. Year three was our love affair with maple sugar and maple
syrup. In year five we began experimenting with natural fruit
sweeteners, and by year six we had found the mixed fruit sweetener we
still prefer today.
We've also experimented with different flours, substituting
:
brown rice flour and whole wheat flour for unbleached white flour and
using rolled oats and finely ground nuts where possible. We've also
lowered the cholesterol in many items by eliminating eggs and dairy
products and replacing them with oil, almond or soy milks, or
unsweetened applesauce.
Working with alternative sweeteners and whole grains always
:
puts one's skills to the test. Here I share with you the techniques
and tips I've developed over the years, so that you can make your own
quality baked goods at home.

Fruit Juice Concentrates ************************

Natural fruit juice concentrates are an excellent alternative
:
to refined white sugar in baked goods as they give excellent flavour
and texture. They contain many micro nutrients, the vitamins and
minerals that are necessary for their assimilation and our
metabolism. And their flavour is so rich and sweet that it is
possible to reduce the total amount of sweetener by at least 50 per
cent in any recipe that uses them.
Fruit juice concentrates are fruit juices evaporated in a high
:
vacuum using low temperatures (the mixtures boil at 110 degree
fahrenheit) until they reach a thicker consistency. Fruit
concentrates come in a number of flavours and are readily available
in the refrigerator section of most natural food stores in pints,
quarts, or gallons.
If you can't find a commercially made fruit sweetener, you can
:
substitute frozen fruit juice concentrates, such as unsweetened apple
and orange juice, which are available in almost every grocery store,
but you will have to cook them down to concentrate them.
Here's my general rule for adapting a recipe that calls for
:
sugar: Simply reduce the amount of sugar by half and replace that
amount with a concentrated fruit sweetener. You will then have to
adjust only your techniques and not the liquid or dry ingredients. If
there is a slightly acidic aftertaste in the finished produce, it is
from too much sweetener and you can reduce it even more next time.
Another substitution we have made for refined white sugar is
:
coconut powder to replace powdered sugar. Once the coconut is finely
powdered, it is mixed with a little dry milk powder and sifted over
pastries to resemble the delicate look of powdered sugar. We also use
raisin water (the liquid remaining from plumping raisins) and
fruit-sweetened james as other replacements for white sugar.
