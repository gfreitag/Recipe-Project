Fill a saucepan with water, and bring to a boil.  Drop the potatoes
into the boiling water and cook until tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
Drain and set aside to cool.  When the potatoes are cool enough to
handle, cut each in half.  Cut a tiny slice off the bottom of each
potato half so it can stand upright.  Using the small scoop of a
melon baller, very carefully scoop out the center of each potato
half, leaving a potato shell.  Place the scooped-out potato centers
in a bowl.  Reserve the shells.  Gently toss the potato centers with
the celery, scallions, carrot, eggs, gherkins, 2 tbsp of the dill,
parsley, salt and pepper.  Mix the mayonaise and sour cream together
and fold into the potato salad.  Adjust the seasonings, and with a
small spoon, carefully mound into the potato shells.  Refrigerate,
covered, until ready to serve.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tbsp
dill before serving and arrange on a decorative platteror in a flat
basket.
