Title: Italian Waffle Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
(Pizzelle)
6 eggs 1 1/2c sugar 3 tsp baking powder juice of 1 orange 1c melted
shortening (Note: Do not use oil; I tried it once & it doesn't work
out right.  Melt some butter or margerine.) 2 tbsp anise seed 4-5c
flour (More or less, depending on humidity etc)

Beat eggs, add sugar gradually, mixing thoroughly.  Add orange juice
(Can also grate some rind in if wanted.), anise seed and melted
shortening. Stir.  Add baking powder to flour & mix well w/other
ingredients. Turn onto floured board, form into strips & cut into 1"
pieces. Cook in cookie iron until light golden brown.

Recipe from Ann Haffly.

My notes:  This makes a lot of cookies; probably around 6-7 dozen.  We
don't make it too often, usually around Christmas.  Since we have the
iron that cooks only one at a time, I usually mix them & then Steve
sits at the table w/our little gas camp stove to cook them.  He
usually is reading a book at the same time so some get a little more
"golden brown" than others. One pound coffee cans make good storage
containers.  These cookies freeze well too; just use the coffee cans
but put some plastic wrap over the cookies before you put the top on.
