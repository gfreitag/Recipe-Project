PUMPKIN 1. Choose finely textured, ripe, and beautifully colored
pumpkins.

2. Wash, cut in quarters or small pieces, and remove seeds.

3. Cook in boiling water, steam, pressure cook, or oven cook until
tender.

4. Scoop the pulp from the skin. Mash in a saucepan, or press
through a ricer, sieve, or food mill into a saucepan.

5. Cool by putting the saucepan in ice water and stirring the pumpkin
occasionally until cold.

6. Pack into containers, leaving 1/4 inch head space for pints, 1/2
inch for quarts. Seal, label, and freeze.

7. Cook frozen pumpkin just until heated through.

PUMPKIN PIE FILLING 1. Prepare the pumpkin as above through step 5.

2. Combine measured amounts of mashed pumpkin with the remaining
ingredients in your favorite pumpkin pie filling recipe (omit cloves,
if used, and add after thawing, because freezing will change the
flavor).

3. Pour the pumpkin filling into containers in single pie amounts.
Seal, label, and freeze.

4. Thaw, add cloves, turn into pastry shell, and bake as your recipe
directs.
