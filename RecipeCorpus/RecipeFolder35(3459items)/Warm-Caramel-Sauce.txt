Title: Warm Caramel Sauce
Categories: Ice cream, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Heavy cream
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 ts Unsalted butter -- cold
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Sugar
3 tb Cold water
Combine the sugar and cold water in a small, heavy saucepan over
medium heat.  Cook to dissolve the sugar, stirring, and brushing down
any crystals on the the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in hot
water. Raise the heat and bring the syrup to a boil.  Boil, without
stirring, until the mixture caramelizes to a medium dark amber color,
5 to 10 minutes; the timing can vary.  Remove the pan from the heat
and gradually add the cream. Take care; the mixture will bubble up
violently.  Return the sauce to medium heat and boil gently until
thickened and smooth, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat.  Stir in
the vanilla; swirl in the butter. Rewarm the sauce before serving.
This sauce will keep, refrigerated, for 3 weeks.
