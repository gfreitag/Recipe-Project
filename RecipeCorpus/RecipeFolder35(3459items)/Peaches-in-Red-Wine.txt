Title: Peaches in Red Wine
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
1 pn Pepper
3 lb Ripe peaches
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Red wine
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1    Whole clove
1. Using a saucepan large enough to cook the peaches in a single
layer and deep enough to be able to cover them with a lid, bring the
wine and brown sugar to a boil. Stir frequently with a wooden spoon
until the sugar dissolves. Add the cinnamon, clove, and pepper. Add
the peaches and cover.

2. Turn the heat to medium-low and poach the peaches until they're
cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove the peaches from the sauce.
Reduce the sauce until it is the consistency of maple syrup, about 15
minutes. You should have about 2/3-cup of sauce. Add the vanilla.

3. When the peaches are cool enough to handle, remove the skins. Serve
whole, halved or slice. Pour the sauce over the peaches.

Can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Return to room temperature
before serving.
