olive oil, and sugar. Can be prepared up to a week ahead.

2. Preheat the broiler.

4. Clean the mushrooms and remove the stems. Place them cup side up
on a broiling rack.

5. Brush the seasoning sauce on the mushroom caps. Position the rack
4-6 inches from the heat and broil until the mushrooms look brown and
crusty, 2-3 minutes. They cook very quickly, so keep an eye on them.

small amount of seasoning sauce that's left in the pan over the
arugula. Sprinkle with the roasted sesame seeds and serve.
