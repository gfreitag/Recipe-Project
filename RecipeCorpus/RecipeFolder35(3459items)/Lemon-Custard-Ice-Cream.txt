Title: Lemon Custard Ice Cream
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 servings
4 lg Egg yolks
pn Salt
1 pt Heavy cream
3    Lemons -- zest only
1/2 c  Lemon juice
3/4 c  Sugar
2 c  Half and half
In a small bowl, combine the lemon zest and lemon juice; stir in the
sugar with a fork.  Let stand for at least 30 minutes.  The sugar
helps release the flavor of the zest.  Scald the half and half over
medium heat; set aside.  Whisk the egg yolks and salt with an
electric mixer until well blended.  Slowly add about 1/2 of the
scalded half and half to the eggs and stir gently; return the mixture
to the saucepan.  Cook the custard over medium low heat, stirring
constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Do NOT
let it boil.  Immediately remove the pan from the heat; strain the
custard into a large bowl.  Stir in the lemon mixture and the heavy
cream.  Lay a sheet of wax paper or plastic wrap directly on the
surface to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until chilled.
Pour the custard into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the
manufacturer's directions.  When the ice cream is thickened and
frozen, cover it and place it in the freezer until nearly firm.  Let
soften slightly in the refrigerator before serving.
