These times are just a guide; each fish is different. When done the
flesh will be firm enough for slicing and feel like the lean part of
a slab of bacon when pressed between the thumb and forefinger.

After brining, place the fish pieces skin side down so they can
drain. Tilt the drain trays so that the brine runs off the fish to
prevent salt deposit build up on the fish. cure 12 hrs at a temp
below 70 F
