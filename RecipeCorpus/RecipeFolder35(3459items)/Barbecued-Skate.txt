Categories: Fish/seafoo, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Ginger; minced or grated
1 ts Tabasco sauce or dried red
.  pepper flakes
1/3 c  Lemon juice; fresh squeezed
2 lb Skate wing; skinless
2 tb Vegetable oil
4 lg Tomatoes; peeled & chopped
1    Onion; minced
3 cl Garlic; minced
1/4 c  Molasses or dark brown sugar
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
The tender meat of skate clinging to the strip of cartilage is
reminiscent of pork ribs.  You'll be surprised how tasty this
combination is.

When fresh ripe tomatoes are available, they are preferable here, but
canned tomatoes are a fine alternative.

**  Directions  ** Heat the oil in a large skillet, add the tomatoes,
onion and garlic and cook over medium-high heat, stirring
occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add
the molasses, Worcestershire sauce, ginger and Tabasco sauce, lower
the heat to medium and cook uncovered until the vegetables are
thoroughly softened and the sauce is thick, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Take from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and let cool.  Taste the
sauce for seasoning. Puree when cool.

Just before serving, cut away any membrane from the skate wings.

Preheat the grill or broiler.

Brush the skate wings on both sides with some of the cooled barbecue
sauce and let sit while the grill heats.

Lightly oil the grill top and add the skate wings.  Cook until the
fish is nicely browned and somewhat firm, about 3 to 4 minutes. Brush
the top with some more barbecue sauce, turn the fish and continue
cooking until the fish is opaque through, about 4 minutes longer.

Transfer the skate to individual plates, brush with more sauce and
serve, passing extra sauce alongside.
