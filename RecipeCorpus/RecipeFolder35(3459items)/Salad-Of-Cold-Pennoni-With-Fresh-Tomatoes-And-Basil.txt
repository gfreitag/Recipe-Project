The perfect summertime salad. I ate it first on a steamy July day in a
trattoria in Florence. Use the ripest, reddest tomatoes and lots of
the freshest basil.

1 pound uncooked imported pennoni (large penne) 1/4 cup extra virgin
olive oil, plus a little extra 2 pounds fresh, ripe tomatoes, peeled,
cored, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1/2 cup packed fresh basil
leaves, julienned or coarsely chopped 1 clove garlic, finely minced
or pressed Salt and freshly ground black pepper to task

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add a
tablespoon of salt and the pennoni and cook, stirring occasionally,
for 7 to 10 minutes, until tender but firm, al dente. Drain and
transfer to a large serving bowl. Drizzle some olive oil over the
pasta, toss well, cover, and allow to cool to room temperature.

2. Combine the olive oil with the tomatoes, basil, garlic, salt, and
pepper in a small mixing bowl. When the pasta is cool, add the tomato
mixture, toss well, and serve.
