In a small skillet wilt the onion and garlic in the oil over low
heat, or omit the oil and wilt them in a microwave.  Place the onion
mixture in a large stock pot and add all of the ingredients except
the cheese, tortillas, and cilantro sprigs.  Stir the mixture well,
then cover and simmer the soup over low heat for about 1 hour.  If it
cooks down too much, add water to bring it back to 8 cups.
When ready to serve, warm the bowls and bring the soup up to a
boil, but don't boil.  Put a heaping teaspoonful of the cheese and a
handful of the tortilla chips in each bowl.  Fill the bowls with very
hot soup and top each with several sprigs of cilantro.  Serve
immediately.

Author's Note:  I have been served tortilla soup with a whole chipotle
swimming on the surface, but I don't recommend it for the novice.
