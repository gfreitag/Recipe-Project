Wonderfully light and delicately crisp, these fritters are not too
sweet and make a delicious ending to any meal.

3 tablespoons sugar Juice of 1/2 lemon 3 medium Granny Smith apples,
peeled, cored, and sliced into rounds about 1/4 inch thick 2/3 cup
all-purpose four 1 cup cold water Vegetable oil for deep frying
Confectioners' sugar

1. Combine the sugar and lemon juice in a medium-size non-aluminum
mixing bowl. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the apple slices, mix
well, and allow to stand for 30 minutes.

2. Put the flour in a small mixing bowl and gradually add the water,
beating with a wire whisk until the batter has the consistency of
heavy cream.

3. Pour enough vegetable oil to fill a deep, heavy saucepan 1 inch
deep and place over medium-high heat. Test the oil by dropping some
batter into the oil. If it bubbles it's ready. When the oil is hot,
slip the apple slices one at a time into the batter. Using a pair of
kitchen tongs, remove the slices from the batter, letting any excess
drip off, then put only as many apple slices into the hot oil as can
fit in a single layer without touching. Cook until the underside is
golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes, then turn and continue cooking until
brown all over, another 3 to 5 minutes. Take the apple slices from
the oil, drain on paper towels, and let cool slightly. Repeat until
all the apple slices are cooked. Dust with confectioners' sugar and
serve warm.
