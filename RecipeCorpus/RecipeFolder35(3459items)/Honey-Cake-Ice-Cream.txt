Categories: Ice cream, Desserts, Israeli, Jewish
Yield: 900 ml
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/4 c  Milk
1 1/4 c  Heavy cream
6 oz Honey cake; store bought
; or make your own!
2    Egg yolks
1    Egg
2/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Honey
1/4 ts Mace
Crumble the honey cake and spread on a cookie sheet.  Bake on a 250 F
oven for 30 to 45 minutes, until dry and crunchy.  Set aside to cool,
then crumble again to make both fine and coarse crumbles.

Beat the egg and egg yolks at high speed until light and fluffy,
about 2 minutes. Gradually add the sugar, beating until mixture
thickens. Lower the speed and mix in the honey, milk, vanilla and
mace. Transfer to a bowl, and add the cream using a hand whisker.
Chill, then pour into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to
manufacturer's instructions. Take the ice cream out of the ice-cream
machine, and add the honey cake crumbles using a hand whisker. Freeze
immediately, let the ice cream mellow for 24 hours, and serve.
