My Scottish grandmother was a fine lady (and artist), yet had few
recipes to hand down.  This one is worth sharing.  Now that
Thanksgiving is around the bend, here's a great (although hardly low
fat) and simple stuffing recipe she used to make.

Combine all ingredients in a bowl with your hands.
Form into a ball.
Tie in clean cloth (we used to cut up a old clean undershirt -- please
no fabric softener -- gives weird taste) with rope.
Simmer tied up ball of stuffing one hour in broth.
Let it sit and get cold (you can prepare a day ahead).
Tastes best reheated.
Zap it in the microwave before serving.

The secret is the undershirt, although purists may want to substitute
cheesecloth, etc.
