Title: Beef Stew In A Crockpot
Categories: Meats, Crockpot, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
lg Carrots in 3" chunks, one
cn Tomato soup (I use
Campbell's) a
Generous sprinkle of pepper,
1    2 bay leaves, and enough
Water to thin
Toss in some cubed beef, no
Need to brown it.  Peel some
Potatoes and
Add them.  Quarter an onion
Or two and add them.  Whole
Baby carrots, or
This can be left to cook for several hours.  You can also mix it in a
casserole dish and cook it for 1-2 hours in a 375 oven, but the meat
won't be very tender.  When you are cutting up the potatoes and
carrots, consider how long you will be cooking it.  I mean, if I am
throwing this into my crock-pot at 8am before leaving for work, and I
know I won't be home until 6-7pm, I cut the vegetables *large* so
they don't overcook.

This stew smells wonderful.  Nice to walk in the house on a cold, wet
evening and get the great aroma!

the soup so that all the ingredients are more or less submerged
