Title: ABM Wheatlet and Corn Flour Bread
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads, Vegetables
Yield: 1 1/2lb loaf
1 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1/4 c  Dried parsley [opt'l]
9 oz Water
1 tb Veg oil
1/4 c  Wheat germ
1/4 c  Oat bran
1 c  Cream of wheat cereal
1 c  Corn Flour
Add the liquid and solid ingredients and the yeast in order according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Run on regular/basic and medium
crust.

The cream of wheat is not as gritty as cornmeal and yet the corn flour
provides the corn taste.

I made my first loaf with parsley but as for any cornmeal bread or
muffin, the addition of garlic, chiles, bacon bits and/or cheese
should work.
