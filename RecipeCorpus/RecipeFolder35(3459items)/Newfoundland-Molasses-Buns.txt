Comments: "These buns proved to be the staple lunch for woodsmen or
fishermen. Made with molasses they did not dry so easily. The pork and
molasses provided heat and energy during cold weather -- almost a
"must" for hard working Newfoundlanders. They were also called "Jay
Buns" because the saucy Jay birds often stole them from the hands of
the men while eating, or they certainly came in for all the
left-overs by the woodsmen."
Comments from Mrs. Mabel Squires, Blackhead, Conception Bay,
Nfld. from "Fat-Back & Molasses", c. 1974.
