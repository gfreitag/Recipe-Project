Title: Bittersweet Chocolate Gnache
Categories: Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
6 oz European bittersweet
Chocolate -- finely chopped
1/2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Light corn syrup
This irresistible ganache can be used as a filling when chilled until
thick and solid, an icing when cooled just until spreadable, and as a
glaze when warm.

In a small, heavy saucepan over high heat, combine cream, butter and
corn syrup. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in
chocolate and place over low heat. Whisk until chocolate melts and
mixture is smooth, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and use as
directed in specific recipes. Makes about 1 cup.
