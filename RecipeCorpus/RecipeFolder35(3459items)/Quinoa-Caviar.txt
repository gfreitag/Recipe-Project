Categories: Appetizers, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 1/2 cups
3 tb Cilantro, minced
3 tb Parsley, chopped
4 ts (to 5 tsp) tamari
-or soy sauce or to taste
2 tb Lemon juice or to taste
Salt and pepper to taste
1 sm Eggplant (10-12 oz)
1 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1    Onion(s), finely chopped
1 c  Quinoa
2 c  Salted water
2    Garlic clove(s), minced
1. Preheat the oven to 350øF. Prick the eggplant in several spots
with a fork. Roast the eggplant on a non-stick baking sheet for 40
minutes, or until soft. Let eggplant cool.

2. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick fry pan. Add the onion and cook
over medium heat until soft but not brown, 3-4 minutes. Stir in the
quinoa and lightly toast it for 1 minute. Stir in 2 cups water and
salt to taste and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pan,
and gently simmer the quinoa for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the
heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Uncover the pan and fluff the
quinoa with a fork. Transfer the quinoa to a mixing bowl and let cool.

3. Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise. Scrape out the flesh, taking
care not to pierce the skin, and place it in a food processor with
the garlic, cilantro, parsley, tamari, and lemon juice. Pure to a
smooth paste. Stir the eggplant mixture into the quinoa. Correct the
seasoning, adding tamari, pepper, or lemon juice to taste. Spoon the
"caviar" back into the eggplant skins and serve it with toast points,
pita chips or on boiled new potatoes with no-fat sour cream.

Makes enough to serve 8-10.
