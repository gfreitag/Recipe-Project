Title: Salmon with Horseradish Crust
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
Salt
Pepper, Black, Freshly
-ground
3 tb Horseradish
3 tb Mayonnaise
2 tb Bread Crumbs, Dry
4    Salmon, Steaks, 1" thick
I use prepared horseradish, but fresh grated can be substituted.

Heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Drain the horseradish and combine it
with the mayonnaise.  Season the breadcrumbs with 1/2 tsp Salt and 1/4
tsp pepper.  Pat the Salmon Steaks dry with paper towel and put them
on a rack in a shallow pan.  Coat the top of the steaks with the
mayonnaise mixture and sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top.  Bake until
almost done, about 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and heat the broiler.
Broil the Salmon Steaks until the crust is brown, about 2-3 minutes.
