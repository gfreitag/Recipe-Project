Title: Carrot and Rice Pur축e
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Five-spice powder
1 tb Butter
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
8    (to 10) unpeeled carrots
-cut into 1" chunks
1/3 c  White rice
1/2 c  Vegetable or other stock
1/3 c  Low-fat milk
1. Bring the carrots, rice, and stock to a boil in a medium saucepan.
Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Add the milk a
few seconds before removing the pan from the heat.

2. Pour the contents of the pan into a food process and add the
five-spice powder, butter, salt and pepper. Pur축e; the consistency
should be thick, similar to mashed potatoes. Serve hot.

Note: Can be prepared several hours in advance and reheated in a
bain-marie. To make your own bain-marie, put the pur축e in a small
saucepan and then put the saucepan into a skillet filled to a depth
of 1-inch with water. Turn the heat to high until the water boils,
then turn it down to medium and heat just until the pur축e is warmed
through.
