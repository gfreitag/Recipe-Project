This hearty, nutritious dish is a Dutch favorite. However, several
other countries have similar dishes -- for example, the French and
Belgian Hochepot and the English Hotpot. Usually potatoes are used
in all versions, along with other vegetables and meat. The Dutch
make the dish with beef; the Scots use mutton, sometimes with beef
added; and the French and belgians include pigs' ears and feet along
with other meat.

Put beans into a large saucepan and pour in water to cover. Cover
saucepan and allow beans to soak overnight. Or, bring beans and
water to boiling; boil 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Cover;
set beans aside to soak for 1 hour.

When beans have soaked, put meat, bay leaf and soup greens into a
saucepot with "lightly salted water". Cover and cook about 2 hours.
Meanwhile, bring the beans with soaking water to boiling; cover and
cook about 1 hour.

Clean, pare and dice carrots and potatoes. Add carrot, potato, onion
and partially cooked beans to meat; cook until meat and vegetables
are tender. Remove meat and slice. Discard bay leaf. Mash vegetables
and spoon into a large shallow serving dish. Pour browned butter
over vegetables. Overlap meat slices along the center and garnish
with parsley.

Makes about 6 servings.

NOTE: For soup greens, use all or a choice of the following
vegetables (carrot, celery, leek, onion, parsnip, turnip) and herbs
(parsley, tarragon, thyme).
