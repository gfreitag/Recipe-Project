Title: Baked Ham With Maple-Pineapple Glaze
Categories: Holiday, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Pineapple juice
3 tb Maple syrup
3 tb Brown sugar
1/2    Partially boned
-country-style cured ham --
-such as Virginia
30    Whole Cloves
Rinse ham well in several changes of cold water. Place in a large
bowl, add water to cover completely and refrigerate overnight.
Remove ham from water and discard the water. Pat ham dry. Place in
roasting pan. Using a sharp knife, remove skin and slice off enough
fat so that a layer only 1/2 inch thick remains. Score ham fat with
crisscrosses to form a diamond pattern. Stick a clove in each diamond.
Preheat oven to 325~.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine pineapple juice, maple
syrup and brown sugar and stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.
Brush surface of ham with some of the glaze and place ham in oven.
Bake, basting every 30 minutes with remaining glaze, until ham is
golden brown and a thick glaze has formed on the surface,
2 to 2-1/2 hours. Remove from oven, cover lightly with aluminum foil
and let rest for 30 minutes before carving.
To serve, cut ham into slices and arrange on a warmed platter or
individual plates. Serve at once.
Serves 8-10.
