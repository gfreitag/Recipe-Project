Categories: French, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1 ds Salt -- to taste
1 ds Black pepper -- to taste
4 oz Butter -- for the roux
1/2 c  Flour -- for the roux
2 c  Locke-Ober cream sauce --
See Recipe
2    Egg yolks -- beaten
1/2 c  Unsweetened whipped cream
2 lb Sole fillets -- cut in 4 oz.
Pieces
8    Jumbo shrimp -- peeled, raw
8    Oysters -- shucked
12    Mushroom caps
2 c  Fish stock -- See Recipe
1 c  Dry white wine
3    Shallots -- chopped fine
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
STEP ONE: Fold sole fillets in half and place in a baking dish with
shrimp, oysters, and mushrooms. Cover with stock, white wine,
shallots, and lemon juice. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with
oiled paper, and poach in a 350-degree F oven for 20 minutes.

STEP TWO: Remove sole fillets and keep them hot in an ovenproof
casserole. Top with mushroom caps. Reduce stock in which fish was
poached to 1/2 the original volume, add roux to thicken, and simmer
for five minutes, blending smooth with a whisk.

STEP THREE: Add Cream Sauce (see recipe for "Locke-Ober Cream Sauce"
in this cookbook) and egg yolks and bring to a boil. Remove from heat
and gently fold in whipped cream. Strain sauce over top of fish and
glaze in the oven until golden brown.

Serve hot, with fleurons (small pastry decorations).
