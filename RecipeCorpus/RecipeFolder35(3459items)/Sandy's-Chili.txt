Title: Sandy's Chili
Categories: Chili, Vegetarian, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Cumin
2 tb Oregano
1    Bay leaf
Salt to taste
2 c  Water
1 cn Tomatoes
1 cn Tomato puree
2 cn Kidney beans
1/3 c  Oil
3 md Onions, chopped
2    Celery stalks, chopped
4    Garlic cloves, minced
1    Bell pepper, chopped
1    Jalapeno pepper, minced,
-(more to taste)
2 lb Tofu chunks
2 tb Red chilis, ground
Chop the onions, celery and pepper. Mince the jalapeno pepper and
garlic cloves.

Saute first five ingredients in oil until limp. Add tofu and saute;
until browned. Mix the spices together in a bowl and sprinkle into
the pot. Mix thoroughly. Add water, tomatoes and tomato paste.  Stir.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring
occasionally. If desired, at this point, add the kidney beans. Taste
and correct seasoning. The addition of 1 tsp. to 1 T. of cayenne
pepper can make this gradually more spicy. As the recipe reads, it's
fairly tame.

The ground chilis are chili powder.  Most chili powder is made up of a
combination of chilis, oregano, cumin, salt and garlic.  If chili
powder is all you can find, then you will have to readjust the cumin
and oregano amounts.
