Categories: Soup/stew, Appetizers, Vegetables, Vegetarian, Nuts/grains
Yield: 5 servings
1 tb Plain sesame oil
2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Dried basil
1/2 c  Kasha
1/2 c  Frozen lima beans
1/2 c  Sauerkraut, pressed dry
1 1/2 ts Miso
1 ea (3") piece kombu
4 c  Water
1 c  Diced onions
1/2 c  Diced carrots
1/2 c  Shredded green cabbage
1/2 c  Diced potatoes
1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
Place kombu in water for 10 minutes to reconstitute it.  Remove
kombu, chop and set aside, reserving water.

Saute onions, carrots, cabbage, potatoes and mushrooms in oil in a
large stockpot until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.

Add garlic powder, basil, kombu, reserved water, kasha, lima beans and
sauerkraut and bring to a simmer.

Remove 1/4 cup broth to a small bowl, dissolve miso in it and return
mixture to stockpot.

Simmer until beans and kasha are cooked, about 8 minutes.  Serve hot.

HINT: for more intense flavor, increase miso to 2-1/4 teaspoons.
