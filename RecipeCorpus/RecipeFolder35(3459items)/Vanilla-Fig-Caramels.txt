Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Vanilla
8 ea Chopped figs
1 c  White sugar
2/3 c  Corn syrup
1 c  Light cream
In a saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup and 1/2 cup cream.  Cook
slowly, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves.  Add vanilla and
bring to a low boil.  Cook until mixture is softly rounded.  Add 1/2
cup cream and cook until mixture is firm.  Remove from heat and add
figs. Pour into greased pan and allow to cool.  Cut before completely
set. Wrap individually after completely cool. Figs can be replaced
with 4 oz unsweetened chocolate, other extract flavours, nuts,
marshmallows, or cut dried fruit. Just add after the caramel mixture
has been taken off the heat and allow to cool slightly or the mixture
may bubble and splutter at you. Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by:
