Title: Mimi's French-Toasted Cottage Cheese Sandwich
Categories: Sandwich, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
5 tb Cottage cheese; well drained
pn Cinnamon
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
4 sl Bread; your favorite
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
2 pn Salt
MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
Strawberries; cut up
Cinnamon sugar
Sour cream; reg or low fat
1. Cut each slice of bread in half. Beat eggs with milk and pinch of
salt. In separate bowl, mash cheese until smooth with another pinch
of salt, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla, adjusting to taste. Spread
one-fourth of cheese filling evenly over four slices of bread. Top
with unspread slices of bread to form half-sandwiches.

2. Gently dip and soak each sandwich in egg-milk mixture, turning so
both sides of each sandwich absorb liquid. Let excess drip off.

3. Heat unsalted butter in 10- inch skillet, and when hot but not
brown, add sandwiches. Reduce heat and fry slowly for 5 to 7 minutes,
or until first side is golden. Turn and brown second side over low
heat. If sandwiches fry too quickly, filling will not be warm.

4. Serve immediately, allowing 2 halves to each portion. Sprinkle with
cinnamon-sugar and top with sour cream and strawberries, or pass all
at the table.

Yield: 2 servings.
