In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, salt and baking powder.
Cut in lard, half at a time, until particles are the size of small
peas. Combine 1/2 cup water, egg and vinegar; add all at once to
flour mixture and stir with a fork just until dough holds together.
Add remaining water only if necessary. Form into a ball; wrap tightly
and refrigerate for several hours. Meanwhile, combine all filling
ingredients. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one-fourth of the
dough to 1/8 in. thickness. Using a 3 1/2 to 4 in. round cutter, cut
dough into circles. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Spread a scant
tablespoon of filling on half of each circle. Moisten edge slighly
with water and fold over, sealing with the tines of a fork. Cut slits
in top of pasties. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. In a
small bowl, beat egg with water; brush tops of pasties. Sprinkle with
poppy or sesame seeds. Bake at 400 deg. for 15 to 20 min. or until
golden. Serve warm Yield: 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 dozen.
