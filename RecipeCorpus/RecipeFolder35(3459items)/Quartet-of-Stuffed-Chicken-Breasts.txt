Note: Use these stuffings as a springboard for your own ideas. Each
can be adapted to serve 1, 2, or a multitude.

Trim the "tenderloins" (save for another use) and any fat off the
chicken breasts and cut each breast in half. Place each half flat on
a cutting board and, using the palm of one hand to hold the breast
flat, cut a deep horizontal pocket in the side with a slender knife.
Make the pocket as large as you can without piercing the top or
bottom of the breast.

Choose a stuffing and stuff the chicken breasts. Pin breasts closed
with toothpicks and season with salt and pepper. Dredge each breast
in flour, shaking off any excess.

Heat the oil in a non-stick fry pan and brown the breasts on both
sides. Add the balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil. Add the stock
and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and gently simmer the chicken
breasts for 2-3 minutes per side, or until cooked. Transfer to a
platter and remove the toothpicks.

Season the sauce with salt and pepper and spoon it over the chicken.
Serve at once.

Prosciutto and Sage Stuffing: Place a slice of prosciutto and 3 sage
leaves in the pocket of each breast half.

Sauerkraut and Smoked Cheese Stuffing: Place a spoonful of sauerkraut
and a slice of cheese in the pocket of each breast half.

Basil and Sun-Dried Tomato Stuffing: Place 2 pieces of sun-dried
tomato and 4 basil leaves in each breast half.

Ricotta and Spinach Stuffing: Cook the spinach in Â« cup boiling salted
water for 2 minutes, or until limp. Drain, refresh under cold water
and drain again. Squeeze the spinach in your hands to wring out as
much water as possible. Finely chop the spinach and mix it with the
ricotta, garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a small bowl. Using a
spoon, stuff the ricotta mixture into the pocket of each breast half.
