1 ts Oregano, dry; crumbled
Salt
Pepper; freshly ground
4    Scallions; thinly sliced

2 lg Tomatoes; very thinly sliced
10    Phyllo dough sheets
3 tb Butter
3 tb Oil, olive
1/2 c  Cheese, Mozzarella; grated
1/2 c  Cheese, Feta;

1/2 c  Cheese, Kefalotyri; grated
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut the sheets of phyllo dough in
half to make 9 x 14 inch sheets. Place the phyllo on a work surface
and cover with a slightly dampened towel.

Melt the butter and olive oil in a small saucepan. Combine the
mozzarella, feta, Kefalotyri or Parmesan, the oregano, and salt and
pepper to taste.

Using a pastry brush, lightly oil a sheet pan with the melted
butter/oil mixture. Place 1 sheet of phyllo in the pan; brush lightly
with melted butter/oil mixture. Place another sheet on top and brush
it as the first. Sprinkle with a scant 2 tablespoon of cheese
mixture. Continue layering in the same manner until all the phyllo
has been used.

Brush the top layer with the butter mixture. Sprinkle with half of the
cheese. Scatter scallions over the cheese. Place the tomatoes close
together in a single layer over the scallions; season with salt and
pepper. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top. Trim the edges,
if desired.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the phyllo
is golden and crisp on the edges.
