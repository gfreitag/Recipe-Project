Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Penndutch, Tomatoes
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Flour
6    Tomatoes; ripe
1 tb Butter
Salt and pepper to taste
Scald ripe tomatoes by pouring boiling water over them and allowing
them to stand a few minutes.  Slip off the skins and cut in small
pieces. Place in a stew-pan with butter and season well with pepper
and salt. Simmer for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add sugar and thicken with the flour mixed smooth with a bit of
water. Let cook a few minutes to thicken, then serve.  If tomatoes
are very tart, a small pinch of baking soda, added when cooked, will
counteract acidity.
