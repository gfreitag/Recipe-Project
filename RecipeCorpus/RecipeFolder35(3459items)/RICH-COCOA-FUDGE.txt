Line 8-or 9-inch square pan with foil; butter foil. In heavy 4-quart
saucepan, stir together sugar, cocoa and salt; stir in milk. Cook over
medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to full rolling
boil. Boil, without stirring, to 234 degrees Fahrenheit or until
syrup, when dropped into very cold water, forms a soft ball which
flattens when removed from water. (Bulb of candy thermometer should
not rest on bottom of saucepan). Remove from heat. Add butter and
vanilla. Do not stir. Cool at room temperature to 110 degrees
Fahrenheit (lukewarm). Beat with wooden spoon until fudge thickens
and loses some of its gloss. Spread quickly into prepared pan; cool.
Cut into squares. About 36 pieces or 1-3/4 pounds.

Marshmallow-Nut Cocoa Fudge: Increase cocoa to 3/4 cup. Cook fudge as
directed. Add 1 cup marshmallow creme with butter and vanilla. Do not
stir. Cool to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (lukewarm). Beat 8 minutes; stir
in 1 cup chopped nuts and pour into prepared pan. (Fudge does not set
until poured into pan). High Altitude Directions

Increase milk to 1-2/3 cups.

Use soft ball cold water test for doneness or test and read
thermometer in boiling water, subtract difference from 212 degrees
Fahrenheit. Then subtract that number from 234 degrees Fahrenheit.
This is the soft ball temperature for your altitude and thermometer.
