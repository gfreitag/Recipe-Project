The sun is rising, and the custom built, low slung motorized buggies
are skimming along the rows of asparagus.  Each buggy carries three
workers, who cut the tender asparagus stalks by hand.  At Connery's
Riverdale Farms Ltd. in the Portage la Prairie area of Manitoba, it's
the beginning of a workday.  For Canada, it's the beginning of this
year's harvest of eagerly awaited homegrown asparagus, which is
better and tastier than the imported stalks.

Lasting from late April to the end of June, Canada's asparagus harvest
yields an impressive 6.6 million pounds for commercial production for
3,935 acres planted.  Once harvested, the sorting and packing are done
on the farm to ensure that the most flavor and freshness are
preserved. This spring, take advantage of local asparagus and enjoy
its ease and versatility.  And remember that it's an excellent source
of folate, a good source of vitamin C, and a source of vitamin A and
thiamine. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%  BUYING  %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The secret to choosing asparagus lies in its freshness, not it's size.
Look for straight, tall (about 9 inch) firm green stalks with closed
purple-tinged tips.  Choose slender stalks for salads and thick one
for side dishes and casseroles.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%  QUANTITY  %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
One pound serve 2 as a side dish, and yields about 3 cups chopped.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%  STORING  %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Store in the refrigerator fo rup to 2 days.  Remove elastic bands or
twist ties, set in 1 inch of water in tall container, or wrap stem
ends in damp towels and enclose in plastic bag.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%  PREPARING  %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Hold stalks upright under cold running water to rinse off any grit.
Holding by stem end and halfway up stalk, bend stalk to snap off woody
end.  If stalks are very thick, use a vegetable peeler to peel of thin
layer from just below tip down to the butt.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%  COOKING  %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In large skillet of boiling water, cook asparagus for 3-5 mintues per
pound or until tender crisp.  Or, using tall asparagus cooker or
bottom of double boiler, stand spears in 2 inchs of boiling water.
Cover with lid or inverted top portion of double boiler and allow to
simmer for 3-5 minutes per pound.  This allows tougher ends to cook
while tender tips steam.
TO STEAM: Cook in steamer basket for about 5 minutes per pound.
