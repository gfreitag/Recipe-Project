1 1/2 c  Sifted flour
2    Beaten large eggs
1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon cooking

Heat pizzella griddle (from kitchen specialty stores) until hot and
brush with oil. Beat eggs in a medium bowl with a fork. Add sugar,
oil, cinnamon and brandy. Mix well. Add flour and mix until smooth.
Drop by heaping teaspoon onto hot, oiled griddle. Cook approximately
40-45 seconds, depending on individual griddles, or until golden
brown. Wafers should lift out easily with a fork. If they're done,
they should not stick.

NOTE: Instead of the cinnamon and brandy, use 2 tablespoon vanilla
extract for plain pizzellas. Use 1/4 cup chocolate syrup instead of
the cinnamon and brandy for chocolate cookies, or 1 tablespoon anise
flavoring and 1 tablespoon anise seed for anise cookies.
