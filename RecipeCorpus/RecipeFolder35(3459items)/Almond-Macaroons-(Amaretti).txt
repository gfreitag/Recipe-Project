These crisp cookies, dense with almonds, are the perfect
accompaniment to the tart taste of citrus granite.

1 1/3 cups (8 ounces) blanched almonds (see note below) 1 tablespoon
confectioners' sugar 2 large egg whites 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1
teaspoon almond extract

1. Preheat the oven to 300-F. Arrange the oven shelves in the middle
third of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment or aluminum
foil, shiny side up.

2. Grind the almonds with the confectioners' sugar until they become
a fine powder. Set aside.

3. Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Gradually beat in
the granulated sugar until the whites are shiny. Fold in the ground
almonds and almond extract.

4. Transfer the mixture to a 14-inch pastry bag fitted with a straight
1/2-inch tube and pipe the mixture out into 2-inch rounds. Bake for 30
minutes, until the cookies are lightly browned and hard. Cool on
racks.

Note: Blanched almonds can be bought in most large supermarkets. To
make your own, cover almonds with water in a small saucepan. Bring to
a boil over medium-high heat. Immediately drain, let cool a bit, and
then rub off the skins.
