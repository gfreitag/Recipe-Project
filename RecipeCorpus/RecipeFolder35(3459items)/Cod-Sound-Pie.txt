Comments: "This recipe came from Western Head, Notre Dame Bay, and may
originally have come from our great-great grand parents who came from
England.  It was always served for Christmas Eve Supper.  The Sounds
were brought from Labrador where our fathers fished in the summer
months. The Sounds were salted down in wooden butter tubs.  Butter
was bought then in 22 and 10 pound wooden tubs.  Today, where Sounds
are available, the fifth generation of our family still has "Cod
Sound Pie" on Christmas Eve and it really is a delacacy."
