Title: Lean Roast Pork with Mustard and Apricots
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
3    Garlic clove(s)
-minced (1 tbs)
1 c  Bread crumbs (pref homemade)
-lightly toasted
Salt and pepper
3 tb Dijon mustard
1 lb (to 1 1/2 lb)
-lean pork tenderloin
10 lg Dried apricots
1/4 c  Minced herbs
-(oregano, tarragon, thyme
-chives, flat-leaf parsley)
Preheat oven to 375øF. Trim any fat off the pork. Poke a hole through
the center of the roast from end to end. Insert apricots in this
hole, pushing them in with your finger. (This gives you a pretty
patch of orange when you slice the roast.)

Combine the herbs, garlic, and bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Season
the roast all over with salt and pepper, and paint it on all sides
with mustard. Dredge the roast in the bread crumb mixture, turning to
coat all sides.

Place the roast on a wire rack over a roasting pan. Bake for 1 hour,
or until cooked. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand for 5
minutes. Cut into «-inch slices and serve.
