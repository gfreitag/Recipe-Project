Title: Porcini Oil
Categories: Condiments, Vegetables
Yield: 2 cups
2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
1 oz Dried porcini
1 c  Water
In a small saucepan, combine the porcini and the water. Cook over
high heat until all the water has evaporated. Reduce the heat to low,
add the olive oil, and heat until the oil reaches 250øF; keep it at
that temperature for 10 minutes.

Remove from the heat and let cool. Put the oil (including the
mushrooms) and the salt in a blender and blend to a coarse pure.
Pour into a one-pint glass jar, let the oil come to room temperature,
and then seal the jar with a tight fitting lid. Store the oil in a
cool, dark place for several days before using. Refrigerated, the oil
will keep for up to three months.
