When we are done we have
Lots of barbeque that we
Can
The first step is to get a
Good hunk of fresh pork, we
Prefer pork
Shoulder or picnic.  Our
Crockpot will hold about two
5 lb Fresh
Picnics
The second step is to precook the pork and thus render out most of
the fat.   What we do is to zap it in the microwave on high for a
while, about 10 minutes per pound, or until basically done but not
dry. It will shrink and loose quite a bit of weight at this stage.

Then debone it and hack the meat up into fist sized pieces or so.
Stuff it into your crockpot.  Toss in a half bottle of favorite BBQ
sauce -- we are partial to Bulls Eye, regular hickory smoke flavor.
You might add a little liquid smoke, but go easy on it.  We use about
1/2 teaspoon.   Then turn it on low and let it cook.   Give it an
occasional stir, say every hour or so.  Add more sauce if it gets too
dry.   At a certain stage (four to six hours or more), it will start
breaking up and you can pull it apart with two forks quite easily. It
will then also start really slurping up the sauce.  Add more sauce,
depending on how wet you want the finished product.

Serve on good kaiser rolls, with steak frys and cole slaw.
