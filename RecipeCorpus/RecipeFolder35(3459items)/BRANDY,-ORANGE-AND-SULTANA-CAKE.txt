Title: BRANDY, ORANGE AND SULTANA CAKE
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
8 oz Butter
4 lg Eggs
8 oz Plain flour
2 oz Self-raising flour
1 1/2 lb Sultanas
2 md Oranges
1/4 pt Brandy
8 oz Caster sugar
The day before baking, place the sultanas in a deep bowl. Grate the
rind from the oranges, add to the sultanas with the juice squeezed
from the oranges (about 1/4 pint) and the brandy. Stir well. Leave
for at least 12 hours to plump up, stirring occasionally. Grease an
8-in. round cake tin and line with 2 layers of greasedproof paper.
Tie a band of brown paper round the outside of the tin. Cream the
butter and sugar, beat in the eggs one at a time and lightly beat in
the sifted flours. Fold in the fruit and all its juices. Turn the
mixture into the prepared tin and bake at 325F. (merk 3) for about 3
hours. If the top of the cake appears to be getting too brown towards
the end of the cooking time, cover with greased greaseproof paper. To
test whether the cake is cooked, insert a hot skewer into the centre
of the cake. It should come out perfectly clean. If any cake mixture
is sticking to it, the cake requires longer cooking. Turn out and
cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight tin.

NB. This is a moist cake and keeps well for 2-3 weeks after baking.
