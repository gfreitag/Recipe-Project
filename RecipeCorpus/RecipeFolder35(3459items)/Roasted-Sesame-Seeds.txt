Title: Roasted Sesame Seeds
Categories: Herbs/spice, Information
Yield: 1 /4 cup
1/4 c  Sesame seeds
Heat a wok or iron skillet over high heat for 1 minute. Turn the heat
to low and add the sesame seeds. Stir frequently. If the seeds begin
to pop, the heat is too high. Lower the heat and remove the wok from
the heat for a few seconds until the seeds stop popping. Roast the
sesame seeds until they turn a few shades darker, 5-7 minutes.

If the roasted sesame seeds are to be stored for longer than a week,
keep them refrigerated. Roasted sesame seeds can be ground and stored
in the refrigerator in a tightly covered jar for up to 2 months.

Note: If you roast less than Â¬ cup seeds at a time, reduce the cooking
time; if a larger amount, increase it.
