This recipe makes about 7 pints and must be processed in a steam
pressure canner because of the low acid ingredients. You'll use all
the basic equipment.

1. Organize and prepare ingredients, equipment, and work area.

2. Combine all ingredients in a large kettle or saucepan, heat to
boiling and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

3. Ladle or pour hot tomatoes into hot jars to within 1/2 inch of
tops. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add additional hot liquid, if necessary, to
within 1/2 inch of tops of jars.

4. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

5. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

6. Process at 10 pounds pressure, 15 minutes. Follow manufacturers
directions for your canner.

7. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
