Gluten is made by washing the starch from high protein flour. It is
found in its highest concentration in wheat.

Make and knead a stiff dough of the flour and water. Roll it into a
ball and submerge in water for 2 hr. Then, keeping the ball
underwater, work the starch out of it by kneading. At intervals, pour
off the starchy water. Recover with water and repeat until the water
runs clear.

Make a loaf and slice in 1/2" strips. Add the oil and onion to a
large pot and fry the onion. Add the gluten strips and cover with
boiling water. Simmer, covered, for 1 hr and drain. At this point the
gluten can be stored refrigerated til needed.

Dip strips in egg and rice/potato flour and fry.

Or casserole in condensed soup or a sauce and heat 20 min in a 350
oven. Serve as a meat substitute.
