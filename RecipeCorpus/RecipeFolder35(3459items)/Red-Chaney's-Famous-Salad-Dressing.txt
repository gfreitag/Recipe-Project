Categories: Dress/stuff, Route 66, Salads
Yield: 1 servings
*****  NONE  *****
In a large saucepan combine 6 3/4 Tbs paprika, 1 1/2 ts Accent, 1
scant tsp salt, 1 tsp ground pepper, 2 1/2  Tbs powdered garlic, and
2 Tbs marjoram.

Blend these together well, then stir in 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 2
1/2 Tbs A-1 Steak Sauce, 5 Tbs El Paso brand canned tomatoes and
green chilies (can use another brand but tomatoes will have to be
chopped fine).

Stir ingredients to a thick paste. Slowly add 6 oz of vegetable oil,
stirring constantly.

After adding the oil, stir in 3 cups of Karo brand white corn syrup,
one cup at a time. Mix well after each addition. Transfer dressing to
wide mouth jar since the dressing should be stirred before using.
Store in refrigerator.

Makes 1 quart.
