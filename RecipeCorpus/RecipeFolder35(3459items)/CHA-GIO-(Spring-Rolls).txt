MMMMM----------------PREPARATIONS FOR ASSEMBLING---------------------
4    Egg; well-beaten
2 c  Peanut oil
20    Sheets dried rice papers
-(banh trang)
Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.

Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters. Place the cut rice paper
on a flat surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten egg over the
entire surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for egg
mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes about 2
minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on several
wrappers at a time.

When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 tsp. of
filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold the
sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.

After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,
put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate, and
fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown. (This is Bach's
special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).

Now, some notes on this recipe:

I had trouble with softening the rice paper with beaten egg; I have
another recipe around here somewhere which uses water, I believe. That
probably is easier. Also, I deep-fried the spring rolls, and did not
put them into cold oil (this increases oil absorption).
