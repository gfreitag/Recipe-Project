-Basic Raw Lamb and Bulgur
Preheat the oven to 325øF. Liberally butter the bottom and sides of a
9x13«x2¬-inch rectangular roasting pan. Divide the meat and bulgur
mixture into two portions, one slightly larger than the other. With
dampened hands, using the larger portion first, form it into
3/4-inch-thick, large flat patties and line them across the bottom of
the pan, placing them very close together. Then, using your finger,
combine the patties until there is one single 3/4-inch-thick layer
across the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface.

Spread the basic filling mixture on top. Then flatten the remaining
meat and bulgur mixture by making «-inch patties, placing them on top
and then smoothing and combining them with your fingers so that the
entire filling is covered. Using a sharp knife, cut the top layer
only, lengthwise, into 2-inch strips. Then cut the layer diagonally 2
inches apart to make diamond shapes.

Trickle the surface with 2 tbs olive oil or clarified butter and bake
for 20-25 minutes or until the surface is slightly browned. Remove
from the oven and serve by cutting through to the bottom of the pan,
following the scored surface marking. Serve hot or at room
temperature.
