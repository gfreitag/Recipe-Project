Title: Canning Apples
Categories: Can/preserv, Breads, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
7 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Lemon juice (to 1/2 cup)
10 qt Cooking apples;
-Peeled, cored, sliced
Place apples in a large crock or bowl; add sugar and lemon juice,
stirring gently to blend well. Cover and allow to stand overnight so
apples can release their juice.

The next day, wash eight quart jars; keep hot until needed. Prepare
lids as manufacturer directs.

Using a slotted spoon, lift apple slices from the juice and place
them in quart canning jars until jars are 3/4 full. Heat the juice to
the boiling point and pour over the apples to within 1 inch of the
tops of the jars. Release bubbles by slipping a plastic knife between
fruit and the side of the jar. Wipe jar rim clean with a clean, dry
cloth or paper towel; attach lid following manufacturer's directions.

Repeat with remaining jars. Process in boiling water canner for 20
minutes at sea level.

Makes 7 to 8 quarts
