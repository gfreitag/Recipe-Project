This fruitcake uses a variety of the more widely available dried
fruits like cranberries, cherries and papaya.

Combine the nuts, cranberries, cherries, raisins, papaya, pineapple
and the 1/2 cup rum in a medium bowl. Stir, then cover and let stand
overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8x4x3 inch loaf pan.
Line the bottom and sides with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and baking powder. Add the
fruit mixture and stir to coat evenly. Blend in the butter and
vanilla.

Fold the beaten eggs into the batter with a rubber spatula. Spoon the
batter into the prepared pan.

Bake for 1 hour or until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes
out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then remove from the pan
and peel off the parchment paper. Let the cake cool completely on a
wire rack.

Pierce holes in the cake with a wooden skewer and spoon the remaining
3 tablespoons of rum over, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap in
cheesecloth, then wrap in plastic wrap or foil. Refrigerate at least
3 days before serving.
