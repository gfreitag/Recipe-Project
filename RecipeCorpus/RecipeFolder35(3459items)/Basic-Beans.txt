Title: Basic Beans
Categories: Vegetables, Low cal/fat
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
1    Clove
Salt
1 c  Dried beans
1    Bay leaf
1 sm Onion(s), peeled
1. Spread the beans on a baking sheet and pick through them, removing
any pebbles. Rinse the beans in a colander. Soak the beans for at
least 4 hours, preferably overnight, in 8 cups water in a large bowl.

2. Drain the beans. Pin the bay leaf to the onion with a clove. Place
the beans and onion in a large heavy pot with 12 cups water. Bring to
a boil, reduce the heat, loosely cover the pot, and simmer (see chart
pg 262). The beans should be tender, soft, but not mushy. Add water
as necessary to keep the beans submerged. Add salt to taste the last
5 minutes of cooking.

Note: To test for doneness, squeeze one bean between your thumb and
forefinger. It should crush easily.
