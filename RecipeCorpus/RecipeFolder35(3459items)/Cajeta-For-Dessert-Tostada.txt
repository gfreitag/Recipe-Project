Title: Cajeta For Dessert Tostada
Categories: Masterchefs, Tex/mexican, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Cornstarch
1 ds Baking soda
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Goat milk
2 c  Milk
Place half the sugar in a small skillet and heat it over medium heat
for about seven minutes, stirring it as it melts. It should be a
medium golden color and free of lumps. Remove from the heat.

Combine the two milks and pour 1/4 of the milk into a bowl. Add the
cornstarch and baking soda to the bowl and set aside.

Add the remaining sugar to the remaining milk and place over medium
heat. Stir occasionally, bringing it just to the boiling point. Add
caramelized sugar all at once, while stirring vigorously. Add reserved
milk, cornstarch and baking soda, and stir well.

Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 50 to 60 minutes.
During the last 15 minutes of cooking, cajeta will begin to thicken.
Stir more frequently at this point to prevent sticking.

CHEF'S NOTE:
Cow's milk may be substituted for the goat' milk, but the flavor will
be different.

NOTE:
This recipe is used in the preparation of another recipe in this
cookbook, "Dessert Cajeta," but may be prepared and used separately.
