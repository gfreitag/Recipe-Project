Categories: Information, Alcohol
Yield: 1 info
No ingredients listed
Here are some suggestions from a 1988 magazine article if you are
feeling creative:

For 1 cup of wine, try 7/8 cup chicken stock for savory dishes or
fruit juice for desserts and the remaining 1/8 cup lemon juice or
vinegar. OR try tomato juice and add some fresh herbs.

For 1-2 Tbsp. dry wine substitute lemon juice or vinegar eg. for dips.

For Amaretto, try 1/2 tsp almond extract for each 1/4 cup liqueur. Add
extract gradually and taste as you go along.

For orange liqueur such as Grand Marnier use equivalent amount of
frozen orange juice plus a little orange rind.

For coffee liqueur, use coffee made with 4-6 times the amount of
coffee you normally use or double-strength espresso.

Other fruit liqueurs, use the syrup from canned fruit (reduced by
boiling).

Rum - try small amount of rum extract or vanilla.
