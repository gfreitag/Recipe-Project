Nutmeg -- optional
1/2 c  Sugar -- plus 1 Tbs
2 tb All-Purpose Flour

In large saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of sugar, flour, ginger and salt.
Whisk in sherry and lemon juice. Cook and stir over medium heat until
mixture is smooth and slightly thickened. Add prunes. Cook and stir 1
min. Remove prunes with slotted spoon and set aside. Add apples to
sherry mixture, cook and stir 2 mins. Remove from heat; cool. Preheat
oven to 425 F. Roll out half the pastry and line 9-inch pie pan;
spoon prunes evenly over bottom. Top with apple mixture. Roll out
remaining pastry. Lay over apples. Seal and crimp edges and prick top
with fork. Brush with egg and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon
sugar. Bake 10 mins. Reduce heat to 375 F and continue to bake 40 to
45 mins, until crust is browned and apples are tender. Cool on rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature. Dollop with sweetened whipped
cream and dust with nutemeg, if desired. Note: Prunes are a fabulous
sweet-tart addition to apple pie. To cook prunes quickly, put equal
parts (cup to cup) of prunes and water in a saucepan. Bring to a
boil, then cover. Simmer prunes with pits for 10 mins; pitted prunes
for 3 to 4 mins.
