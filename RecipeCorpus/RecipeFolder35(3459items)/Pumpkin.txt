1    Pumpkin info
Small sugar or pie pumpkins provide the best results.  Pumpkins
should have a hard rind and stringless, mature pulp. DO NOT mash or
puree pumpkin. HOT PACK:  Wash pumpkin;  remove seeds.  Cut into 1
inch slices and peel.  Cut flesh into 1 inch cubes.  Place pumpkin in
a saucepan.  Cover with boiling water.  Bring to a boil, boil 2
minutes.  Pack hot cubes into hot jars to within 1 1/4 inches of top
rim.  Add boiling cooking liquid to cover pumpkin leaving 1 inch head
space. Remove air bubbles; readjust head space. Wipe jar rims. Center
snap lids on jars. Apply screw bands til fingertip tight. Process 55
minutes for pints and 90 minutes for quarts in pressure canner at 10
lbs for weighted gauge and 11 pounds for dial gauge.

I would advise you to follow canning rules til you feel you can
experiment a little.
