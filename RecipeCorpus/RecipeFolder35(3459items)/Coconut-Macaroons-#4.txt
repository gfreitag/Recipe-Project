Title: Coconut Macaroons #4
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 1 batch*
14 oz Can Sweetened Condensed Milk
2 ts Orange rind, finely grated
1 ts Vanilla
3    Egg whites
pn Salt
1 lb (4 cups) SWEETENED shredded
Coconut
OR
8 oz (2 3/4 cups) UNSWEETENED**
Shredded coconut
* Makes 16 large or 30 small cookies ** Unsweetened coconut is drier
and will swell as it absorbs the condensed milk.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and place oven racks in the middle
position. Line one or two sheet pans with foil or kitchen parchment
paper. Set aside.

SPECIAL NOTE: Depending on the freshness and moistness of the
coconut, you may not need to use the entire can of sweetened
condensed milk!

Mix coconut and condensed milk just until coated. (See above special
note) Stir in orange rind and the vanilla.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt, beat until
foamy. Mix into the coconut.

Using a one ounce small scoop, or two ounce ice cream scoop, scoop
mixture onto the lined pans, leaving 1 1/2 inch space between cookies.

Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes (small cookies) or 25 to 30
minutes (for the large cookies) until golden brown on top and well
browned on the bottom.

If using two baking sheets at the same time on separate racks, switch
positions halfway through baking to prevent over cooking or burning.

Slide foil or parchment paper with its cookies onto a cooling rack
and cool for five minutes.

Peel the foil or paper off the still warm cookies and then cool the
cookies completely on a rack.
