;stock [above] plus
4 ts Pepper
1 ts Cayenne pepper [opt'l]

*You might want to add come basil leaves or cilantro sprigs here.

Trim all fat off the meat and cut against the grain into 1/4"
thick strips. [Meat is easier to cut when partially frozen and it
will cut evenly].

In a saucepan, combine beef stock, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar;
bring to a boil over high heat. Add mint, shallots, scallions and
chiles. Cool and strain.

Mix the stock and the other ingredients together in a bowl. Add
the meat and cover. Marinade overnight. Or put meat and marinade
in a sealable plastic bag. Either way turn the meat occasionally
to ensure that all portions get well soaked in the marinade.

Remove from marinade and let dry on a rack. Line a cookie sheet
with foil and arrange meat on it in a single layer. Or place meat
directly on oven racks, line bottom of oven with foil. Or on rack
in shallow pan  Dry for 6 or more hours at 175, turning after 3
hours. Continue to dry in warm oven if necessary. Gas ovens with
pilot lights work especially well. Cool and bag it.
