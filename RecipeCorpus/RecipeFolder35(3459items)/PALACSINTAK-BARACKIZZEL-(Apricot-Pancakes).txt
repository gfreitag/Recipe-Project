Title: PALACSINTAK BARACKIZZEL (Apricot Pancakes)
Categories: Breakfast, Pcake/waffl
Yield: 14 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
4 ea To 6 T. butter
3/4 c  Apricot jam
1 c  Ground walnuts or filberts
(Makes 14-24)
3 ea Eggs
1 c  Milk
1/3 c  Club soda, freshly opened
7/8 c  Flour
3 tb Sugar
Beat the eggs lightly with the milk in a small bowl.  Combine with the
club soda in a large mixing bowl.  With a wooden spoon stir in the
flour and sugar, then add the salt and vanilla.  Combine to stir until
the batter is smooth.
Melt 1 teaspoon of butter in an 8-inch skillet, preferably a pancake
skillet.  When the foam subsides, ladle in enough batter to cover the
bottom of the skillet thinly and tilt the skillet from side to side to
spread it evenly.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned
on one side, then turn and brown lightly on the other.  When a pancake
is done, spread 2 teaspoons of jam over it, roll it loosely into a
cylinder, then put it in a baking dish in a 200 degree oven to keep
warm until the pancakes are finished.  Add butter to the skillet as
needed.  Serve warm as a dessert, sprinkled with the walnuts and
confectioner's sugar.
