Step 5. If desired, add to the 7 1/2 cups soymilk one of the popular
flavoring combinations.  (listed with our favorites first)

Step 6. Soymilk may now be served hot. Or for a richer, creamier
consistency, a deeper sweetness, and a flavor more like that of dairy
milk, chill by covering and setting pot in circulating cold water for
10 to 15 minutes. This quick cooling increases shelf life. Pour
soymilk into clean (or sterilized) bottles and cover tightly.
Refrigerated, it will keep for 3 to 6 days; if from it will keep
indefinitely.

VARIATIONS: Non- boiling Water Grind: If using a plastic blender that
will not stand boiling water, substitute hottest tap water when
pureeing, but mix okara with boiling water. If using a food mill or
juice, grind beans without water, mix ground beans with 6 cups of
boiling water and allow to stand for 2 to 3 minutes.Rinse out mill or
juicer with 1/4 cup boiling water, then transfer puree to pressing
sack and proceed from step 3.

Rich Homemade Soymilk (makes 3 1/4 cups): Soak only 1 cup dry
soybeans. Drain, divide into 2 equal portions, and puree each portion
with 1 3/4 cups boiling water. Rinse blender with 1/4 cup boiling
water, extract soymilk in pressing sack, then sprinkle okara with 1/2
cup boiling water and re-press. Use to make silken tofu, soft tofu,
or yuba. Or, use in cooking like cream.

High-yielding Soymilk: In Step 3, rinse okara with 3 1/2 to 4 1/2
boiling water. Yields 8 1/2 to 9 1/2 cups thinner (but still good)
soymilk.
