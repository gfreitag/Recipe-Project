Title: Substitute Bisquick
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 servings
1 ea Tb Salt
1 1/8 c  Lard
1 ts Cream of tartar
4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 1/3 ea Tb Baking powder
2/3 c  Milk, powdered
In large bowl, sift together all dry ingredients. Blend well. With
pastry blender, cut in shortening until evenly distributed.  Mixture
will resemble cornmeal in texture.  Store in large airtight container
in cool, dry place. Use within 10-12 weeks. Sylvia's comments: I
mixed this up in my Osterizer, rather than cutting the shortening in
by hand. Worked great, all I had to do was manually turn the bowl the
opposite of the way it wanted to go a few times. Worked fine in
recipes, too. Source: _Make-A-Mix Cookery_ Posted on GEnie by S.KERR7
