This is a very rich pastry with a crumbly-cookie texture.

2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted
butter, at room temperature and cut into 8 pieces 2 large eggs,
lightly beaten

1. Combine the flour and sugar in a food processor fitted with the
double-edge steel blade. Process for about 10 seconds to combine. Add
the butter and process for 15 seconds, until the texture of the flour
resembles that of cornmeal. Add the eggs and process for about 30
seconds, until the dough forms a ball on the blade.

2. Remove the dough, wrap securely in plastic wrap, and flatten into a
circle with your hands. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before
rolling out. If you refrigerate longer than 30 minutes, the dough
will become quite stiff and you will need to leave it at room
temperature for about 30 minutes before rolling.

3. Unwrap the dough and place it on a well-floured work surface. Roll
about 1/4 inch thick, then place the dough in a 9-inch pie pan. With
your fingers, press the dough as evenly as possible into the pan.
Press it up the sides to form a decorative edge.
