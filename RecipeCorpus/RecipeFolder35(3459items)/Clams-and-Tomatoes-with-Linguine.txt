Categories: Fish/seafoo, Pasta/rice, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Dry linguine pasta
1 tb Dried hot red pepper flakes
1 tb Chopped fresh Italian
Parsley
1 tb Finely shredded fresh basil
-leaves
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
3 ea Cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 c  Chopped onion
36 lg Clams, scrubbed and rinsed
1 c  Chopped fresh plum tomatoes
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan.  Saute the garlic and onion over
low heat until the onion is tender.  Stir in the clams, then the
tomatoes and wine. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat until the
clams have opened. Discard any clams that do not open.

While the clams are cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a
boil and cook the linguine until al dente.  Drain the linguine and
divide evenly into 4 warm plates.

Season the clams with the hot pepper flakes.  Taste the sauce for
salt. If necessary, add a little water to cut the saltiness.  Spoon
the clams (in their shells), laong with the sauce, over the linguine.
Sprinkle each serving with parsley and basil.  Serve at once.
