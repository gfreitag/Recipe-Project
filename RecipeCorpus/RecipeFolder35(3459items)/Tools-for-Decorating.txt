Strainer: Having a small strainer on hand can mean the difference
between a rough-textured sauce and a rich smooth one; easier to use
for small jobs than a full-size strainer; also great for sifting
powders or spices over foods or plate rims.

Mold: Available in all shapes and sizes in kitchen shops, molds can
be as simple as a cup or a glass you already have on your shelf;
great for molding rice, couscous or other starches for polished
presentations.

Squeeze Bottle: You know those lovely squiggles you see dressing up
plates in restaurants and magazines? All it takes is a simple squeeze
bottle and a squeezable smooth sauce.

Zester-Stripper: Use to create long strips of citrus zest, or fine
shreds of zest for sprinkling; strips of zest can 'tie" bundles of
asparagus or green beans.

Slotted Spoons: These are important for helping to drain off excess
liquid from vegetables and garnishes before adding them to the plate.
Chinese style ladle-strainers are also a versatile option.

Tiny Cutters: Often called "aspic cutters", these can be used to cut
eye-catching shapes from cooked egg white, bell peppers, cheese or
citrus zest.
