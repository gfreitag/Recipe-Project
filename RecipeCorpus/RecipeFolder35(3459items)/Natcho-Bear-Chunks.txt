Cut the bear meat into bite sized chunks, trying to remove as much
fat or gristle as you can.  Place in a greased 9x13 inch pan.  Slice
onions and sprinkle over top of meat, mixing slightly.  Mix the bbq
sauce, water and spices and pour over top of meat and onion mixture.
Bake in a 350 oven for about an hour, or until meat is tender, and
most of liquid has baked off. Sprinkle the cheese mixture over top,
return to oven for about 15 minutes until melted and bubbly.  Remove
from oven, allow to stand about 5 minutes to allow cheese to 'set up'
and then serve.  Can be served over hot cooked rice, or cooked and
drained pasta. Origin: Sharon Stevens, Nacho Expert Shared by: Sharon
