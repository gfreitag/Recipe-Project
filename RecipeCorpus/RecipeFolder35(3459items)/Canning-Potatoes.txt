Title: Canning Potatoes
Categories: Can/preserv, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
2 lb To 3 lbs; Makes 1 quart
Potatoes have to be cooked before packing, so, in addition to the
basic equipment for steam pressure canning, you'll need a large
saucepan or pot. You'll also need a vegetable peeler, unless you
prefer to use a paring knife.

1. Select perfect, freshly dug potatoes.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Wash potatoes well, using a vegetable brush. Peel and then wash
them again. If desired, (hmmm, chuckle...various strange visions
dancing in my mind's eye....) cut potatoes to fit the size jars you
are using.

4. Cook potatoes in boiling water to cover for 10 minutes in a large
saucepan or pot. Drain.

5. Pack hot potatoes into hot jars to within 1 inch of the tops. Add
boiling water to within 1 inch of tops. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to each
pint, 1 teaspoon to each quart, if desired.

6. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the insides of jars to
release any air bubbles. Add more boiling water to within 1 inch of
tops, if necessary.

7. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

8. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

9. Process at 10 pound pressure, 30 minutes for pints, 40 minutes for
quarts. follow manufacturers directions for your canner.

10. follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
