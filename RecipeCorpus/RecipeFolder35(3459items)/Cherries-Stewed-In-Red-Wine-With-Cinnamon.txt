This is a classic Italian preparation for cherries that dates back to
the eighteenth century when fruit was moved from its traditional
place at the beginning of the meal to its now customary place at the
end. Cinnamon brings out the best cherry flavor. Pit the cherries
first with a cherry-pitting tool.

1 cup sugar 3 cups dry Italian red wine (such as Chianti or Spanna) 1
cinnamon stick, about 3 inches long 2 pounds bing (dark red) cherries,
stems removed and pitted

1. Combine the sugar, wine, and cinnamon stick in a large, heavy,
non-aluminum casserole or saucepan. Place over medium-high heat and
cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Add the cherries, lower
the heat, and cook, covered, about 10 minutes, until the cherries are
tender and lose their bright red color.

2. Use a slotted spoon and transfer the cherries to a large serving
bowl, leaving the cinnamon stick in the casserole. Cook the
wine-and-sugar mixture with the cinnamon over medium-high heat 7 to
10 minutes, until the liquid is thick and syrupy. Remove the cinnamon
stick and discard. Pour the syrup over the cherries and allow to cool
to room temperature or chill before serving.
