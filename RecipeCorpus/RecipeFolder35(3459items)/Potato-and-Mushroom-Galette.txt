Title: Potato and Mushroom Galette
Categories: Side dish, Potatoes
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Pepper
2 1/2 lb All-purpose potatoes
1 1/2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1 lb Assorted wild mushrooms
1 1/2 tb Butter
2 1/2 tb Canola oil
Salt
1. Rinse the mushrooms thoroughly in cool water Lift the mushrooms
from the water and drain well. Slice the mushrooms «-inch thick.

2. In a large non-stick skillet, melt the butter in 1 tbs of the
canola oil. Add the mushrooms, « tsp salt and the pepper and cook
over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the exuded liquid has
evaporated and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl. Wipe out the skillet.

3. Peel the potatoes and shred them in a food processor or on a box
grater. Rinse the strips and pat dry.

4. Heat the olive oil and the remaining 1« tbs canola oil in the
skillet. Add the potatoes and « tsp salt, toss and saut over high
heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer 1/3 of the
potatoes to a bowl. Press down on the remaining potatoes in the
skillet to create a thin, firm "bed". Spoon the mushrooms over the
potato bed, then spread the reserved potatoes on top so that they
cover most of the mushrooms; press down lightly to compress the
galette.

5. Cover and cook the galette over moderate heat, shaking the pan
occasionally, until browned on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Remove
from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes. Invert the galette onto a
round platter, cut into wedges and serve.
