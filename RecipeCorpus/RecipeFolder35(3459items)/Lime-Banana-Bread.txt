Categories: Breads, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1 3/4 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
2 tb Grated lime zest
cn Be doubled or tripled
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Oil
2 ea Eggs
1 c  Mashed bananas (about 2
-large, 3 medium)
In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients and the lime rind. In
seperate bowl, Beat together the eggs and oil until bubbly and
frothy. Slowly fold in the mashed banana, and then pour into well in
center of dry ingredients. Using spatula, fold dry mixture from
outside of bowl into center until mixture is well blended.  Scrape
into a well greased and floured loaf pan and let sit for about 2
minutes. Bake in a 325F oven for 45-60 minutes or until loaf tests
clean.  Invert immediately onto cooling rack and place towel over
top.  Wait about 5 minutes, and loaf should come out of pan quite
easily.  Cool completely and wrap in plastic wrap. The lime flavour
will become a little more pronounced if allowed to sit overnight in
fridge before serving.  Is nice served plain or with butter as a
snack or for lunches. If warmed slightly and Cool Whip placed on top,
it makes a nice light dessert.  This loaf will freeze quite nicely.
