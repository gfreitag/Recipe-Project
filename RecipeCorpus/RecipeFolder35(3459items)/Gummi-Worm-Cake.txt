Title: Gummi Worm Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Kids, Holiday, Desserts
Yield: 1 cake
2    Pkgs gummi worms
1    Pkg Oreo cookies
1    Chocolate cake
Chocolate frosting
Make a chocolate cake according to the package or recipe
instructions. You may use purchased chocolate frosting or make your
own.  Spread it on the cake as thickly as possible.  Crush 1/2
package of Oreo cookies with a fork or rolling pin. (It will look
just like packaged potting soil.  Play with it until you get just the
desired effect. )  Sprinkle on frosted cake and garnish with the
gummi worms.  Make some of the worms look like they are crawling out
of the cake.  Then sprinkle the top liberally with the crushed
cookies.  It looks disgusting (kids love it) but it is delicious!!
