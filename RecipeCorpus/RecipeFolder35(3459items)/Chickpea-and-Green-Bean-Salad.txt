Heat chickpeas in their liquid and drain.  Place in a bowl.  Combine
all ingredients for chickpea dressing and pour over chickpeas while
they are still warm.  Mix well.  Cool, cover and set aside.  Combine
all ingredients for green bean dressing.  Wash and trim beans, and
cut into 3/4-inch long pieces.  Steam or boil beans until just
tender. Drain thoroughly. Shake them in a colander until they look
very dry. Put beans in a separate bowl from chickpeas and pour bean
dressing over them. Let sit for 5 minutes. Combine the two beans and
mix well. It's best to let the chickpeas sit in their dressing for
several hours before mixing them with the green beans so the
chickpeas can absorb the flavors. Serve cold or at room temperature.
