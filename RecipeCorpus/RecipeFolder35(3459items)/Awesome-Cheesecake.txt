Title: Awesome Cheesecake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 16 servings
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Vanilla (or almond)
16 oz Cream cheese
1 pt (500 ml) sour cream
5    Eggs
Cream the cream cheese, then add the ingredients in the order given-
one at a time. Pour into a spring form pan on top of a graham wafer
crust.  Bake at 325 degree oven for one hour, then turn off the oven,
do not open the door for one hour.  If you have a self-cleaning oven,
you will need to open the door just a little, and prop it open for
the hour (I find a folded grocery bag is the right size).  Remove
from oven, and put the cake into the fridge (after it cools) for
about 8 hours.

Top with fruit- cherry pie filling, fresh or frozen strawberries,
etc., then with a dollop of whipped cream.
