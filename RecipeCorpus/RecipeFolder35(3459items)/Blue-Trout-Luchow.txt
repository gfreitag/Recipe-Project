When cooking fish "au bleu" it is just the skin that turns blue during
the cooking process. To achieve the blue color you must have VERY
fresh fish- alive if possible. The fish should not be washed or
scaled, just eviscerated.  The fish are poached in a vinegar Court
bouillon and the natural slime of the fish together with the boiling
acidified water blues the skin.

Combine all the ingredients except the trout and bring to a boil.
Lower the heat and simmer 20 min; strain through a cheesecloth.

Bring the strained liquid back to a boil while preparing the fish.
Kill them with a sharp blow to the head. Split and clean with as
little handling as possible being careful not to disturb the body
slime. Plunge the fish into the boiling bouillon, bring to a boil
again and remove from the heat- let stand in the hot liquid for 5 to
8 min depending on the size of the fish. The fish should be done
enough to flake easily. Remove and drain. Garnish and serve. Or chill
and serve cold in aspic or on a bed of lettuce with horseradish or a
cold sauce.
