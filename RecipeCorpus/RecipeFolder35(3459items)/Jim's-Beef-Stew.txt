Dredge stew beef in flour, salt and pepper. In a cast iron Dutch oven,
brown stew beef. Add tarragon, marjoram, rosemary and garlic, cook
and stir 2-3 minutes. Add wine and cook and stir 2-3 minutes. Add
beef broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, simmer
for 2 hours. Add carrots, potatoes and onion, cook for about 45
minutes, than add peas. Cook 15 minutes or until vegetables are just
tender. Add roux a tablespoon at a time, until broth is thickened
like gravy. Adjust seasoning, cook until bubbly, than cook about 3-4
minutes. Serves 4-5

NOTE: I prefer making my own stew beef from a sirloin or chuck roast.
I also prefer my own beef broth, but canned can be used. The wine I
use is Taylor Lake Country Red.
