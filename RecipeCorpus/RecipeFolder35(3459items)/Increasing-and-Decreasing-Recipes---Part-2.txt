How to Achieve Some Tricky Measures:

Here's how to measure amounts for which there aren't any stand spoon
or cup measures. You'll run into this when you double or halve
recipes.

1/8 teaspoon   Fill the  1/4 teaspoon measure and level it off. With
the
pointof a knife, mark off half and remove.

1/3 tablespoon Measure 1 teaspoon.

1/2 tablespoon Do as for 1/8 teaspoon using the 1 tablespoon measure,
or
measure out 1 1/2 teaspoons.

2/3 tablespoon Measure 2 teaspoons.

Measure 2 tablespoons.
1/8 cup

Measure  1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons.
3/8 cup

Measure  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons.
5/8 cup

Measure 1 cup less 2 tablespoons.
7/8 cup

Quick Hint: How much is a dollop? Cookbook writers love this word. It
probably means 1 or 2 rounded tablespoons.
