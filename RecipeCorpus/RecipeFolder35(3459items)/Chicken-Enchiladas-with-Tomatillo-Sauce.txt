2    Whole chicken breasts

1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1. TO MAKE THE SAUCE.  Husk and wash the tomatillos.  Bring a pan of
water to the boil, add the tomatillos and jalapeno peppers and time
for 10 minutes.  Drain and remove the stem ends of the peppers.  Put
the tomatillos, peppers, onion and garlic in a food processor and
process to a coarse puree.

2. In a large pan heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add the
vegetable puree and simmer 2 minutes.  Stir in the broth and salt;
simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Set aside.

3. TO MAKE THE ENCHILADAS.  Place the chicken in a large saucepan and
cover with cold water.  Bring just to a boil, reduce the heat, cover
and simmer until cooked through.  Remove the chicken from the water
and cool slightly.  Shred the chicken and set aside.

4. Combine the cooled, shredded chicken with the minced onion, sour
cream, and salt.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the tomatillo sauce.  Set aside.

5. In a 9- to 10-inch frying pan heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Put 1 tortilla at a time in the hot oil and fry about 30 seconds on
each side. Drain on paper towels.  Cool slightly.

6. Spread a little of the sauce in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Spoon
some of the filling down the center of each tortilla and roll.  Place
in the baking dish; it will be a tight fit.  Spoon the sauce over the
enchiladas and sprinkle with the cheddar and asiago cheeses.

7. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven 25 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes
before serving.
