Categories: Meats, Vegetables, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 tb Caraway seed
1 lg Onion
2 lg Cans whole tomatos
1 lg Rack of Pork Ribs (or more)
2 lg Cans (or bags) Saurkraut
4 md Potatoes
Wash and cut the ribs in serving size pieces. Lay in a roasting pan.
Slice the onion and lay on top. Peel and cut up the potatoes and lay
them on top. Cover all with the saurkraut. Sprinkle the caraway seeds
on top. Pour the tomatoes (with juice) over everything. Cover and

This is the way my family has made this for years and the ingredients
are a guesstimate. No one ever used a recipe. But this is GOOOOOOD!
We always have it for New Year's Eve.
