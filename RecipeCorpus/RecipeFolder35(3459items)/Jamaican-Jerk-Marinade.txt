Combine all ingredients in food processor and process until smooth.
Use as a marinade for poultry, pork or beef. Use on meats that are to
be grilled for a tasty caribbean treat.

I also like to take a skinned cut-up chicken, marinate in Jerk, place
in cooking bag with Jerk sauce and cook in oven for about an hour or
until chicken is done. Serve this with or over white rice with some
kidney beans for a Jamaican meal.
