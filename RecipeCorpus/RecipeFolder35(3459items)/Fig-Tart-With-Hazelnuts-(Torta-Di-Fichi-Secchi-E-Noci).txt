This is a wonderfully rich and hearty dessert- dense with figs and
infused with orange flavor- to make in the winter when only dried
figs are available. It comes from a great chef, Jody Adams, who runs
the kitchen at Michela's restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
where her cooking is earthy and delicious.

CRUST: 1/4 cup hazelnuts 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut
into tablespoon-size pieces 2 tablespoons water FILLING: 1/2 pound
dried figs, stems removed and cut into quarters Zest of 1 orange,
finely chopped Juice of 1 orange 3 large eggs 1/2 cup mascarpone
Juice of 1 lemon 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour Pinch of salt 1/2 cup
sugar 1/2 cup toasted coarsely chopped hazelnuts

1. Preheat the oven to 400-F. Place all the hazelnuts on a baking
sheet. Place in the oven and toast for 10 minutes. Cool slightly.
Grind or chop in a food processor.

2. To prepare the crust, combine the ground nuts, flour, salt, and
sugar in a medium-size bowl. Add the butter and work it through your
fingers into the dough until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add
the water and toss through your fingers into the dough. Squeeze some
dough in your hand. If it holds together fairly well, you've added
enough water. If not, add more water, a tablespoon at a time, until
it does hold together. Place the dough on a counter top. Using the
heel of your hand, smear the dough across the counter. Repeat. Form
the dough into a flat cake and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

3. Preheat the oven to 400-F. Roll out the dough and line a 9-inch
springform pan with it. Refrigerate until ready to fill.

4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the figs with the orange zest and
juice and toss well. Allow to macerate for 30 minutes.

5. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the mascarpone, lemon
juice, flour, salt, and the orange juice from the figs. Gradually
beat in the sugar.

6. Distribute the figs evenly over the bottom of the prepared crust.
Sprinkle over the hazelnuts. Pour the mascarpone-and-egg mixture over
the figs, then fold the pastry down to form a nice edge. Bake for 10
minutes, then reduce the oven to 350-F and bake for an additional 20
to 30 minutes, until set. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
