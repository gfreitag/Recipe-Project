This recipe comes from The Secrets of LA's Low-Fat Baker to the
Stars, Mani Niall printed in Eating Well Magazine March/April 1993.

According to Mani, prune puree is used to replace most, but not all,
of the fat in these wholesome cookies. The taste and texture of a
fat-reduced cookie is far superior to a fat-free cookie.
