Title: Roasted Shallots
Categories: Vegetables, Information
Yield: 1 batch
1/4 ts Black pepper
2    Bay leaves
A few sprigs thyme
24    Shallots (1 lb)
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Salt
1. Preheat the oven to 325øF.

2. Peel the shallots, leaving them whole. To keep them from falling
apart, cut away only a small amount of the root end.

3. Toss the shallots with oil in an ovenproof pan. Spread the
shallots out so they aren't touching. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Add the bay leaves and the thyme. Cover with foil and bake for 30
minutes. Uncover, turn the heat up to 350øF, and bake for an
additional 30 minutes.

4. Turn the heat to 450øF and roast for 15 minutes more, shaking the
pan every few minutes to brown the shallots on all sides.

Can be prepared up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated.

Note: Large shallots can be separated into two parts by cutting off
the outer layer; you'll find two bulbs inside.
