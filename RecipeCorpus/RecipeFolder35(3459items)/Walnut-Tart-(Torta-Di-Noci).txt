Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
ISBN 0-02-009078-1; 1994
Dense with walnuts, this traditional tart is more of a cake than a
pie. It is deliciously moist and rich and not too sweet. Dust the top
with powdered sugar before serving.

3 cups walnut pieces 4 large eggs, separated 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon
granulated sugar Rind of 1 lemon, grated Powdered sugar for garnish

1. Preheat the oven to 350-F. Lightly butter and flour a 9-inch
springform pan.

2. Place the walnut pieces in a blender or food processor fitted with
the steel blade and chop them finely, being careful not to
over-process them into a paste. Set aside.

3. Beat the egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer until light and
fluffy. Add the lemon rind and walnuts and mix only enough to combine.

4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer
until stiff. Fold them into the egg yolk-and-walnut mixture. Pour
into the prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour, or until golden brown. Cool
on a rack. Remove the sides of the pan, dust with powdered sugar, and
serve.
