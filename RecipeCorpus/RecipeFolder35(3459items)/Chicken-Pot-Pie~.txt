Preheat oven to 325~. In a large saucepan, combine the broth, carrots,
potato, parsnip and 1/4 tsp. salt. Bring to a boil over high heat,
reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until potato is almost tender,
about 5 minutes. Stir in pearl onions, peas and chicken, return to a
boil, reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked
through, about 5 minutes. In another large saucepan, combine the
evaporated skim milk, flour, sage, remaining 1/4 tsp salt and pepper.
Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the sauce has
thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, about 2 minutes. Stir in
chicken mixture and cook for 1 minute longer. Spoon chicken mixture
into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan. Layer filo sheets on top,
overlapping the sheets at right angles, tucking in edges and lightly
spraying each layer with nonstick cooking spray. Cut a 3-inch X in
the center of pie, pull back the corners and lightly spray the
corners with nonstick cooking spray. Bake pot pie for 10 to 15
minutes or until filling is heated through and the filo is crisp and
lightly golden. Serves 4.
