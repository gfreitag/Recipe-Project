Title: Jim's Brownies
Categories: Chocolate, Cake/cookie
Yield: 24 servings
3/4 c  Cocoa
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  White sugar
1 ts Dark rum
1 c  Raisins
3/4 c  Butter
4    Eggs
1 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Flour
Melt cocoa and butter in a double boiler. Let cool. Beat eggs and salt
until foamy. Add the sugars, vanilla and rum gradually and continue
beating until well creamed. Combine the chocolate mix into the eggs.
Add the flour and raisins [most recipes call for nuts, raisins are a
personal preference] and fold just long enough to mix. Pour into
baking pan: a 9x13 for chewy squares or a 9x9 for deeper, cakey bars.
Bake for 25 min in a preheated 350 oven. Cool, cut  and serve with
vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and/or fresh berries. Garnish with
chocolate chips and/or shredded coconut. Drizzle with rum or a
liqueur. Or go crazy and do all the above.
