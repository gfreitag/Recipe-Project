Title: Lemon Ice (Granita Di Limone)
Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
ISBN 0-02-009078-1; 1994
Deliciously tart and tangy, this is a refreshing palate pleaser.

1 1/2 cups Sugar Syrup (see page 286) 1 cup fresh lemon juice with
pulp 2 1/2 cups cold water

1. Combine the sugar syrup, lemon juice, and water in a medium-size
plastic or metal mixing bowl and stir well to combine. Place the bowl
uncovered, in the freezer and freeze for 3 to 4 hours, stirring the
mixture occasionally, until slushy. (Because of the amount of sugar
syrup in it, the mixture will not freeze solid.)

2. Transfer the slushy lemon ice to a blender or a food processor
fitted with the steel blade and process for about 30 seconds, until
frothy and smooth. Pour the mixture back into the plastic container,
cover, and freeze for 1 to 2 hours, until firm but not hard.
