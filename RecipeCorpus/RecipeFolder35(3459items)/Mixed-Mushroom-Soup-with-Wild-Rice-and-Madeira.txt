In a small bowl, pour the warm water over the dried mushrooms,
weighting them down so that the mushrooms are completely submerged;
soak for 30 minutes. cut off and discard the tough stems. Squeeze
excess liquid from the mushrooms back into the soaking liquid, then
strain the liquid through a dampened coffee filter to get  rid of any
fine grit. Slice the mushrooms and set them aside along with the
liquid.

Wipe the cultivated mushrooms with dampened paper towels, t rim off
the stems and slice the mushrooms thickly. Set aside.

In a 7-qt. Dutch oven, melt the butter and saut the shallots over
medium heat, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add both kinds of
mushrooms and saut, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Add the cooked
rice along with the reserved mushroom liquid and the chicken stock.
Bring to a boil, lower the heat, season with salt and pepper to taste
and stir in the tomato paste. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.

Pure in batches in a blender or food processor; the soup should not
be too smooth. Return soup to the same pot, stir in the cream and
reheat on low heat. Stir in the Tabasco sauce and the wine; adjust
seasoning. SErve hot, topped with a few snipped chives, if desired.
