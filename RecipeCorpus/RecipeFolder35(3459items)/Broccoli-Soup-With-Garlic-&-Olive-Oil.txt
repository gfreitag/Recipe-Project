Title: Broccoli Soup With Garlic & Olive Oil
Categories: Vegetables, Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
6 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Lemon juice
Salt and pepper
French bread
Grated parmesan cheese
2 bn Broccoli
1/2 c  Olive oil
8    Cloves garlic -- thinly
Sliced
2 ts Dried thyme
Cut the florets off the broccoli and again into smaller pieces so
that each floret is about an inch in diameter.  Cut off and discard
the bottom 2" of the stems.  Peel the remaining stems and slice them
as thinly as you can. Combine all the ingredients except for the
salt, pepper, bread and cheese in a 4 qt pot.  Bring the soup to a
simmer, cover it, and turn the heat down low enough to keep the soup
at a slow simmer.  Simmer for 1 hour. Stir the soup with a spoon to
break up the broccoli and season it with salt and pepper.  Serve
slices of toasted bread at the table and pass the grated cheese.
