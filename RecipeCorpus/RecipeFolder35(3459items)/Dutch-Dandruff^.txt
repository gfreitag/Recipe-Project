With an adult's help, preheat oven to temperature on package.

Grease the inside of both cake pans with vegetable shortening, then
lightly dust with flour. Prepare and bake cake according to package
directions. After removing cake from pans, allow to cool on wire rack
for at least 1/2 hour.

Place one layer upside down on cake plate. Spread a thin layer of
frosting on top only, then carefully place the second layer on top of
the first layer.

Fill ziploc bag with the rest of the frosting and twist the top
tightly shut. Using scissors, cut off a TINY bottom corner of the bag.

To decorate: Think of the top of the cake as the top of a human head
and imagine a part running down it's middle. Now, using the plastic
bag of icing as a pastry bag, squeeze a stream of frosting hair
falling from the imaginary part down the side of the c

Using a dab of frosting, glue two cherries on the cakes face for eyes
and one for a nose. then, using clean scissors, carefully cut a piece
of fruit roll into the shape of a tongue. Fold tongue in half
lengthwise to form a realistic crease down the middle

Sicko serving suggestion: Stick a sterilized comb or afro pick in the
side of your cakes head!
