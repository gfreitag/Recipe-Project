Source: Cooking Vegetables
One of the simplest and best salads there is. This recipe comes from
Sicily, where most of Italy's oranges grow.

6 Valencia oranges peeled and thinly sliced 1 medium-size red onion
thinly sliced 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/4 cup pitted oil-cured
olives

Arrange the orange and onion slices on a large serving plate in a
single layer, alternating them in an overlapping fashion. Drizzle the
olive oil over the top, sprinkle with the olives, and serve.
