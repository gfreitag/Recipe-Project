Categories: West europe, Breads
Yield: 2 loaves
1 1/2 pk Active dry yeast
3/4 c  Warm water
4 1/2 c  Rye flour
4 c  All-purpose flour
2 c  Water
4 tb Butter (or margarine)
4 tb Sugar (or 2 packets Sweet &
-low)
3 ts Salt
Heat the water in a small saucepan. place the butter, sugar, and salt
in a large bowl. Pour the hot water over these ingredients, and stir
briefly. Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast into a small bowl, mix
with 1/2 cup of lukewarm water, and set aside for 5 minutes. When the
yeast has softened, stir it into the water, butter and sugar mixture.
Using a wooden spoon, beat in the rye flour. When the flour has been
fully incorporated, mix in 2 cups of the all-purpose flour. Stir
until both flours are well blended. Sprinkle a pastry board with 1/2
cup of all-purpose flour. Work this flour into the dough by kneading
for 8 to 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and shiny. If the dough
seems sticky, add more flour. Grease a large bowl and set the dough
in it. coat the top surface lightly with melted butter. Cover with a
linen towel that has been slightly moistened with water and squeezed
out. Set the bread bowl in a warm, draft-free place and allow the
dough to rise until it is just about double in size (about 1 hour).

Punch the dough down. Turn out on a pastry board and knead for 3 or 4
minutes. Divide into 2 equal portions and roll each portion into a
ball. Grease a baking sheet lightly. Set the balls of dough on it and
flatten them with your hands to 1-inch thickness. Allow them to rise,
covered, until nearly double (about 45 minutes). Preheat the oven to
400 degrees F. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes to a golden brown. Remove
from baking sheet and cool on a wire rack. To serve in the
traditional Finnish way, cut in wedges and spread thickly with butter.
