Title: Peach-Almond Turnovers
Categories: Fruit, Pastry
Yield: 8 servings
3 tb All-Purpose Flour
1/2 c  Almonds -- sliced
2    Sheets Puff Pastry, Frozen
Defrosted
1    Egg, Beaten With 1 Tsp
Water
4    Ripe Peaches, Peeled, Pitted
Cut in 1/2" chunks
2 tb Peach Liqueur
1 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
1/4 ts Ground Nutmeg
1/2 c  (+ 3 Tbs) Sugar
1. Place the peaches in a bowl and toss with the peach liqueur, lemon
juice, nutmeg, and 1/2 cup sugar. Let stand for 10 mins. Add the
flour and the almonds and toss to coat well. 2. Preheat the oven to
350 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. 3. On a
lightly floured surface, roll 1 sheet of the pastry out into a square
slightly larger than 10 x 10 inches. Trim to form a 10-inch square
with very straight sides. Cut into four 5-inch squares. Brush the egg
mixture lightly around the edges of each piece. 4. Place about 1/3
cup of the filling slightly off center on each square. Fold over the
pastry to form a triangle and pinch the edges together to seal
securely. Place the turnovers on the baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining sheet of pastry and filling. Brush tops with a little of
the egg mixture and sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Bake until
golden brown, about 25 mins. Serve warm. Makes 8 turnovers.
