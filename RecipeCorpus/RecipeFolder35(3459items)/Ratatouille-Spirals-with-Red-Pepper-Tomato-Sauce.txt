RATATOUILLE: Place mustard seeds into a small pan.  Cover & toast
until the seeds sputter & pop.  Remove from heat & set aside.

Spary a large skillet with oil & heat over moderate heat.  When hot,
add eggplant, ginger & chilies.  Stirring constantly, fry until the
eggplant begins to brown & sticks to the pan.  Stir in the spinach &
chick peas. Add peppers & cilantro & fry for 5 minutes.  Cool
slightly. Transfer to a food processor, pulse & then process to a
coarse textured paste. Add mustard seeds, season & pulse twice more
to mix. Spoon mixture into a pastry bak fitted with a number 8 plain
tube.

Cover phyllo sheets with waxed paper & a damp dishtowel to prevent
them from becoming brittle.  Place one phyllo sheet on a piece of
waxed paper & spray with oil.  Fold in half lengthwise to make a 6 X
18-inch sheet & spray again.  Leaving 1-inch at either end, pipe a
band of filling 1-inch from the folded long edge.  Fold over short
ends, lift the folded long edge over the filling & roll into a
cylinder. Turning the cylinder seam side down, gently wind into a
losse spiral. Spray with oil & transfer to a parchment lined baking
sheet. Cover loosely with plastic while making the rest of the
spirals.

Preheat oven to 350F & bake for 45 minutes or until they are golden
brown. Serve hot or warm, 2 per person, accompanied with sauce.

RED PEPPER-TOMATO SAUCE: Preheat broiler & char the peppers until the
skins blacken.  Transfer to a bowl, cover & let steam for 15 minutes.
Rub skins off.  Seed & chop.

Place coriander seeds in a skillet & saute over medium heat.  Add
tomato, carrot, & cook for 25 minutes.  Force ingredients through a
sieve. Season & drizzle with oil.
