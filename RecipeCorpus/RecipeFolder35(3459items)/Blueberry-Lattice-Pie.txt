Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM-------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
In small pieces
6 tb Vegetable Shortening, Cold
6 tb (To 8) Ice Water
2 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Kosher Salt
1/4 lb Unsalted Butter, Cold -- cut
MMMMM------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
6 c  Fresh Blueberries --
Cleaned
1    Egg, Beaten With 1 Tsp
Water
1/2 c  (+ 2 Tbs) Sugar
1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 ts Orange Zest -- grated
1. To make the crust, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large
bowl. Use your fingers to rub in the butter and shortening until the
mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually and lightly mix in just
enough ice water for the dough to be gently pressed into a ball.
Flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 1 hour. 2.
Preheat oven to 400 F. 3. To make the filling, combine 1/2 cup of
sugar, cinnamon, flour and orange zest. Add blueberries and toss to
coat. Divide the dough in half and roll out 1 piece on a lightly
floured surface and fit into a 9-inch pie pan. Place the filling in
the dish. Roll out the remaining dough, cut into 1/2-inch-wide
strips, and weave into a lattice top. Seal, trim, and crimp the
edges. Brush the top pastry with the egg wash and sprinkle with the
remaining sugar. 4. Bake for 30 mins. Reduce heat to 325 F and bake
until the crust is browned and the filling is set, about 20 mins
longer. Place on a rack to cool. Cut into wedges and serve. Serves 8.
