apple. Close cavity of duckling with skewers; truss.  Prick skin with
a fork at 2-inch intervals.  Place duckling, breast side up, on a
rack in a shallow roasting pan.  Melt jelly in a small saucepan over
low heat. Brush duckling generously with jelly.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until a
meat thermometer registers 185 degrees F, basting occasionally. After

overbrowning. If desired, garnish with grapes and apple slices before
serving. Yield: 2 servings.

WINE JELLY:
Combine sugar and wine in a large Dutch oven; bring to a boil,
stirring constantly.  Stir in pectin; boil 1 minute, stirring
constantly. Remove from heat, and skim off foam with a metal spoon.
Quickly pour jelly into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-inch
headspace; wipe jar rims.  Cover at once with metal lids, and screw
on bands. Process in boiling-water bath 5 minutes. Yield: about 3-1/2
cups.
