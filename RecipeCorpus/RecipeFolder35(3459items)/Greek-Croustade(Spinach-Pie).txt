Title: Greek Croustade(Spinach Pie)
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Onion, chopped
3 tb All purpose flour
1 c  Milk
1 c  Cottage cheese,cream style
10 x  Sheets phyllo dough, thawed
1 pk (10oz)frozen spinach,chopped
3 tb Butter
1/4 ts Terragon, dried, crushed
2 x  Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 c  Butter, melted
Cook spinach according to package directions; drain well, pressing out
excess liquid. In saucepan cook onions in the 3 T butter until
tender. Stir in flour, tarragon and 1/8 ts. pepper. Add milk all at
once. Cook and stir mixture until thickened and bubbly. Stir about
half of the hot mixture into eggs; return all to saucepan. Stir in
cheeses and spinach. Set aside.
Unroll phyllo dough; cover with dampened towel. Remove 1 sheet of
phyllo dough; brush lightly with some of the 1/2 cup melted butter.
Fold in thirds lengthwise; brush the top with butter. Place one end
of the folded sheet in center of a 12 or 14 inch pizza pan extending
it over side of pan. Repeat buttering and folding remaining dough and
butter; arrange strips spoke-fashion evenly around pan(the ends of
each sheet will overlap in the center and be about 3 inches apart at
outer ends). Spread spinach mixture in an 8 inch circle in center of
pastry. Starting with the last phyllo leaf placed in the pan, lift
end of leaf up and bring toward center of filling. Holding end with
both hands, twist end several times; coil and tuck end under to form
a rosette. Lay rosette over filling, leaving a three inch circle in
center(filling should be visible). Repeat with remaining strips in
reverse order they were placed. Drizzle any remaining butter over
all. Bake in a 375 degree oven 35 to 40 minutes or until golden.
Serve warm or cool, cut in wedges.
Margarine may be substituted for the butter(but why?), and more
feta may be added if desired, to taste.  This recipe sounds
complicated; but really is easy, and well worth the effort!
