Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Green pepper -- finely
Chopped
Paprika -- to taste
4    Whole potatoes
1/2 c  Butter

Peel potatoes and grate them into cold water. Let stand for 5 minutes.
Drain and squeeze all liquid from potatoes. Spread on clean toweling
to dry.

Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet, add onion and pepper, and
saute for two minutes. Add the potatoes. Sprinkle thickly with
paprika, cover tightly, and cook over very low heat for 15 minutes.
Check occasionally to be sure the potatoes are not sticking to the
bottom of the pan, but do not stir. Add extra butter, if needed, by
lifting potatoes carefully with a spatula and pour melted butter
under them.

Carefully slide potatoes onto a warm plate. Melt remaining butter in
skillet and invert potatoes into skillet. Continue to cook another 10
minutes, until done.
