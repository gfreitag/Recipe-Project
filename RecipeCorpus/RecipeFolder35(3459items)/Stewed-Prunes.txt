Title: Stewed Prunes
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
-concentrate
2 c  Water
Additional water
3 c  Pitted prunes, cut into
-about 6 pieces per prune
1/2 c  Undiluted orange juice
Cut prunes.  In saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to boil.  Add the
chopped prunes and simmer for about 10-15 minutes over low to medium
heat. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm. Place cooled
prunes into clean glass quart jar.  Add the undiluted orange juice
and enough water to fill the quart jar.  Stir until thoroughly mixed.
Tighten lid and store in fridge.  Will keep for 3-4 weeks. After
sitting for a day or two, the liquid does become quite thick, and I
just keep adding a bit of water from time to time. The prunes do take
up a bit of the orange flavour making them a bit more palatable. I
have used this as a regime for most of my clients and it has enabled
them 'regularity' without drugs or harsh laxitives. I give them about
1/2 to 3/4 cups of this mixture each morning. Origin: Sharon Stevens
