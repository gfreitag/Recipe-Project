Title: Poached Lake Trout Fillets W/ Horseradish Sauce
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 8 servings
3 md Leek; washed and sliced
2 sm Turnip; peeled and diced
1 sm Bunch fresh parsley
4 lb Lake trout fillet; skinless
2 qt Chicken stock
1/2 md Celery stalk; chopped
3 md Carrot; peeled and diced
MMMMM---------------------HORSERADISH SAUCE--------------------------
4 tb Whipping cream
1/2 c  Prepared horseradish
Salt and pepper; to taste
4 tb Butter
4 tb Flour
4 c  Chicken stock
In a 3 qt pan heat the chicken stock to a simmer.  Blanche the
vegetables until tender-crisp.  Remove them from the stock and set
aside. Make the horseradish sauce: melt the butter in a saucepan over
medium heat. Whisk in the flour. Stir until smooth. Add the stock
gradually, whisking constantly until sauce is smooth. Whisk in the
cream and horseradish. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir until the
sauce is thickened. Set aside and keep warm.

Cut the trout fillet into 8 oz chunks. Poach these fillets in the
stock for 4 minutes, turn and poach for 4 minutes more until firm;
the fish should not be so done as to flake or fall apart. Transfer
the trout fillets to warmed soup plates; surround and sprinkle them
attractively with the poached vegetables and chopped parsley. Ladle
stock over trout and then the horseradish sauce. Serve with a crusty
Italian, French or sourdough bread.
