Preheat the oven to 425 degrees; grease baking sheet and set aside.
In a teflon coated skillet, brown sausage, add oregano and garlic and
stir until well cooked. Drain and set aside. Place individual
biscuits on prepared baking sheet; use the bottom of a floured
measuring cup to flatten each biscuit into a 4 inch circle, leaving a
rim round the edge. Fill with sausage and tomato puree; sprinkle with
cheeses and salt. Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden brown and cheese
is melted. Garnish with olives if desired.

Other meats can be substituted for the sausage; ham is delicious.
Serve with soup and salad for a light supper
