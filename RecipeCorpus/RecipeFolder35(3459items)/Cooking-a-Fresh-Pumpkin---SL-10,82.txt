Title: Cooking a Fresh Pumpkin - SL 10/82
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 info

"When selecting pumpkins for cooking, remember that the biggest may
not necessarily be the best; smaller pumpkins contain less water,
resulting in less waste.

To prepare a fresh pumpkin for cooking, start by slicing it in half
crosswise.  Place the halves, cut side down, on a jellyroll pan. Bake
at 325 degrees F for 45 minutes or until fork tender.  When it's
cool, the pumpkin can be peeled and the pulp mashed.  You'll find
that a 5-pound pumpkin will yield about 4-1/2 to 5 cups of cooked,
mashed pulp.

When pumpkins are harvested during the Fall months, they can be
stored for enjoyment in the Winter.  A pumpkin will keep about one
month at room temperature or two or three months if refrigerated."
