Title: Poached Apples W/Cinnamon-Glazed Pecans & Cider Granita
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Maple Syrup
3 c  Water
3/4 c  Rum
4 lg Sweet-Tart Cooking Apples
(Macoun) -- peeled, cored
2 c  Apple Cider
1/3 c  Sugar
3/4 ts Ground Cinnamon
2    Egg Whites
2 tb Water
2 c  Pecans
1. To make the granita, pour the cider into a large shallow pan and
place it in the freezer. Stir every 30 mins until firm throughout but
not frozen solid, about 2 hours. 2. Preheat the oven to 250 F.
Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl. In another bowl,
whisk together the egg whites and water until frothy. Stir the pecans
into the egg white mixture to coat. Drain well. Place the pecans in
the cinnamon sugar and toss to coat well. Spread the nuts on a baking
sheet in a single layer. Bake, stirring twice, until the pecans begin
to dry out, about 45 mins. Set aside. 3. Combine the maple syrup,
water, and rum in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a
simmer. Add the apples, cover and poach until the apples are tender,
about 15 mins. Remove the apples from the liquid and set aside. Bring
the poaching liquid to a boil, reduce the heat slightly, and simmer
until reduced to 1 cup, about 30 mins. 4. To serve, coat the bottom
of 4 plates with the syrup. Place 1 apple and a scoop of the granita
on each plate. Scatter some pecans over the plate and serve
immediately. You will not need all of the pecans. Store the rest at
room temperature in an airtight container. Serves 4.
