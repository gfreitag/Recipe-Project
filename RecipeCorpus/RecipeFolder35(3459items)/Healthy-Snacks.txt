SNACKS - Snacks should not supplant meals.  Make sure you don't spoil
dinner by eating too much of a good snack. DIETARY FIBER - What you
want out of snacks besides good taste is good fiber. Fresh fruits
with edible seeds such as berries or skins (apples, peaches) dried
fruits, raw vegetables, and whole grain crackers and bread are all
good sources of fiber. BRUSH THOSE TEETH - If you choose a sitcky
food such as dried fruit, plan to brush your teeth soon afterwards;
otherwise; tooth decay. FRUIT POPS - Blend different types of fruit
together in a processor and then freeze the concoction for a healthy
snack. YOGURT SAUCES - Make sauces and dips with nonfat plain yogurt
as the base. CHIP ALTERNATIVES - Instead of chips, try toasted
shredded wheat squares sprinkled with a small amount of grated
parmesan cheese, whole grain english muffins, or toasted plain corn
tortillas. Origin: House Hints + Formulas, by Erik Bruun. Shared by:
