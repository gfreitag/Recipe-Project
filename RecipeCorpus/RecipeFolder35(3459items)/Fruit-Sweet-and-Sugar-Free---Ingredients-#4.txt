Ingredients (cont'd) ********************

Unbleached White Flour: *********************** Bleached by an aging
process rather than a chemical process, unbleached white flour is
made from a blend of hard wheats, but it is still a good all purpose
flour. When combined with whole wheat pastry flour, it gives
unsurpassed flavour and texture to pastries and biscuits.

Whole Wheat Flour: ****************** Containing both the bran and the
germ, whole wheat flour is made from hard wheat and is used mainly in
breads. It might also be labeled as whole wheat bread flour.

Whole Wheat Pastry Flour: ************************* Because this flour
still contains the bran and germ, it is slightly brownish in colour.
It is made from soft wheat and is best used in pastries, biscuits,
and cakes. Whole wheat pastry flour may be used interchangeably with
white cake flour.

White Cake Flour: ***************** Made from soft wheat, this flour
makes the whitest, lightest and most tender cakes.

Brown Rice Flour: ***************** For those who are gluten
sensitive, brown rice flour, which is available from natural food
stores, is a good alternative to wheat in everything but yeasted
breads. Brown rice flour often gives a crunchy, crumbly texture. Yet,
in most baked goods, the difference in texture is not even
noticeable. Brown rice flour should be stored in the refrigerator as
it is especially susceptible to rancidity. When rice flour is rancid,
it will impart a slightly bitter aftertaste to baked goods.

Oat Flour: ********** Available from natural food stores, oat flour
has very little gluten and is best used in combination with other
flours. If you would like to make your own oat flour, blend rolled
oats, 1/2 cup at a time, in either a food processor or electric
blender. Once ground, oat flour should be stored in the refrigerator,
as it is especially susceptible to rancidity. When oat flour is
rancid, it will impart a slightly bitter aftertaste to baked goods.
