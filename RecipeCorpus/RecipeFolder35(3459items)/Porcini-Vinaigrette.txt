Title: Porcini Vinaigrette
Categories: Condiments, Vegetables
Yield: 1 /4 cup
1 ts Dijon mustard
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 c  Soaking water from
-porcini mushrooms
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Lemon juice
1. Strain the soaking liquid into a saucepan and reduce over low heat
until only 2 tbs remain, about 15 minutes. Let cool.

2. Dissolve the salt in the lemon juice. Add 1 tbs of the reduced
porcini water (save the rest to make another batch or use in stocks
or stews), the mustard, olive oil, pepper, and soy sauce. Whisk or
shake in a tightly covered jar until blended.

Can be prepared several days ahead and refrigerated. Return to room
temperature before using.

Note: When you reduce the soaking water for dried porcini, be careful
not to let it boil away. Set a timer for 10 minutes and check the
pot. If it does boil away, add Â¬ cup of water to the saucepan and
continue the reduction until 2 tbs remain. As long as it hasn't
burned, it can be salvaged.
