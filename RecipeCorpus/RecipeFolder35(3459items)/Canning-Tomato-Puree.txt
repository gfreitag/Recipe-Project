You'll need all the basic equipment for boiling water bath canning,
plus a sieve or food mill and large preserving kettle. Use 1/2 pint
or 1 pint jars only. The quantity of canned tomato puree will vary
greatly, depending on how long you simmer the tomatoes.

1. Select fresh, firm, red ripe, perfect tomatoes.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Dip tomatoes into boiling water for 1 or 2 minutes to loosen the
skins. Then dip them in cold water. Slip off skins and cut out cores.

4. Cut tomatoes into chunks and place in a large preserving kettle.

5. Cover and cook over low heat until the tomatoes are soft.

6. Uncover and simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until
very, very soft.

7. Press through a sieve or food mill, then return to kettle and
simmer until the mixture is the thickness of catsup, stirring
frequently.

8. Pour or ladle into hot 1/2 pint or pint jars to within 1/4 inch of
the tops. Add 1/2 teaspoon each of sugar and salt per pint, if
desired.

9. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

11. Process in a boiling water bath for 30 minutes for 1/2 pints and
pints.
