Title: Basic Pasta Dough
Categories: Italian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 36 large dump
4    Eggs
6 tb Very cold water
4 c  Sifted flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Oil
In a large bowl mix the flour and salt. Make a well in center of
flour. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing slightly after each addition.
Add gradually the water and oil. Mix well to make a stiff dough. Turn
dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes
until smooth and elastic. Divide dough into fourths. Lightly roll
each portion 1/8" thick and cut lengthwise into 5" wide strips. Use
the strips immediately, do not allow to dry. Place 2 teaspoons of
whatever filling you are using 1 1/2 " from the narrow end and in the
center of the strip. Continue along the strip, placing the filling at
3" intervals. Fold the strip in half lengthwise, covering the mounds
of filling. To seal, press the edges together with the tines of a
fork. Press gently between the mounds to form rectangles 3" long. Cut
apart with a pastry cutter and press the cut edges with the tines of
a fork to seal. Let the ravioli dry for about 2 hrs. Then in a large
saucepan bring to a boil: 7 quarts water with 2 Tb salt. Gradually
add the ravioli. Boil rapidly, uncovered, about 10 min or until
tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain. Place on a warm
platter and top with a sauce.

[If you make this often consider a mold for mass producing them].
