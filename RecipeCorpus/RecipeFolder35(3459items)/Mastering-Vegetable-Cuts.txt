When making precision cuts, it's important to use a sharp knife. Dull
knives not only produce rough-looking cuts, they're also dangerous.
Let the blade do the work. If you find yourself pushing excessively
hard to make a cut, your blade is too dull.

1. Square off the sides of the vegetable to make a 2-inch-long
rectangular section. Save the trimmings to use in stocks or stews.

2. Slice lengthwise into 1/8-inch slabs for julienne; larger for
baton. Use a sharp knife, hold it securely, and slide the blade,
don't force it.

3. Stack a few slices and cut them into 1/8-inch strips for julienne;
larger for baton. For even cuts, align the edges of the stack.

4. Line up the strips for dicing. Use the knife blade to tap the
julienne into alignment. Cut only a few stick at a time; a larger
pile may slip as you slice.

5. Cut the julienne at even intervals (1/8-inch for confetti-like
brunoise). Use the hand holding the food as a guide, keeping
fingertips tucked under slightly and away from the blade.

6. Uniformly cut vegetable look neat and cook evenly. Vegetables that
don't slice into neat slabs, such as leeks and scallions, can simply
be cut into even lengths, turned lengthwise, and sliced into 1/8-inch
strips.
