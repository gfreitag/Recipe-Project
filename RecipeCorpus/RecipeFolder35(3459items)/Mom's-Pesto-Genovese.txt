Title: Mom's Pesto Genovese
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Italian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 c  Romano or Parmesan cheese,
. grated, (or better still,
.  1/4 cup of each)
Salt & black pepper
2 c  Fresh basil leaves *
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 tb Pine nuts or walnuts
2 cl Garlic, crushed
Traditionally served with flat spaghetti such as fettucine or
linguine, or the potato "pasta" called gnocci, it's also good with
fusilli or rotini, which is full of twists for the pesto to cling to.

Place basil, oil, nuts and garlic in a food processor and blend until
smooth.  Using a rubber spatula, scrape mixture into a bowl.  Mix in
cheese, salt and pepper.  Stir in 2 tablespoons water from the cooking
pasta and then toss well with hot pasta.

* Make when fresh basil is available (dried basil won't work).  Pesto
will keep in the refngerator for 3 months when covered with 1/8" of
olive oil.

Pasta is often served with freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
and freshly ground black pepper.
