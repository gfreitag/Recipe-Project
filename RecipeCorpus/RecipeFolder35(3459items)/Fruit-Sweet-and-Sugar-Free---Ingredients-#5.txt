Ingredients (cont'd) ********************

To Measure Flour: ***************** Measure the quantity of flour
called for in the recipe before sifting. Do not shake or pack it into
the measuring cup. Use a scoop to place the flour in the cup, then
cut off the excess evenly with a knife. Or, dip the measuring cup
into the flour, and level off the excess with a knife. Never level
flour by shaking the measuring cup.

Flour on the Work Surface: ************************** When the recipe
indicates that a dough should be kneaded or rolled out on a floured
surface, sprinkle the surface with a light coating of flour, adding
additional flour only as necessary. Dough absorbs flour easily, and
too much flour can alter the recipe proportions, affecting both taste
and texture.

Frozen Fruit ************ Use only individually quick frozen fruits
without added sugar. A number of years ago I spoke with a gentleman
who spent his college summers as a purchasing agent for a frozen
fruit company. I asked him to explain to me why frozen fruit, such as
raspberries and strawberries, have such a wonderful colour, beautiful
fragrance and full flavour. He explained that because the freezing
process itself breaks down flavour and smell, the frozen fruit
companies have to contract with growers for the best of their crops;
the fruit with the best colour, flavour and smell. He said that
canned fruit processors have similar contracts, as the canning
process is even harder on fruit than freezing. So, unfortunately, the
fruit and berries available to the consumer are rarely the top
quality, those having already been contracted away.

Fruit Sweetened Jams ******************** Fruit sweetened jams come
in many delicious flavours. I am especially fond of the jams from
Sorrel Ridge because of their consistently high quality of both taste
and appearance. Fruit sweetened jams are available in natural food
stores and many supermarkets.
