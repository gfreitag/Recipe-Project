Title: Hot & Spicy Nuts
Categories: Holiday, Snacks, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Seasoned salt
1 1/2 c  Mixed unsalted roasted nuts
1 tb Coarse (kosher or sea) salt
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Celery salt
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1. Preheat oven to 325F
2. Melt butter in sauce pan over low heat. Add remaining ingredients
except nuts and course salt.
3. Add nuts and stir to coat. Spread on a baking sheet and bake for
15-20 minutes, shaking the pan a few times while baking.
4. Toss the nuts with the coarse salt and let cool.

Store in an airtight container.

I suggest you make about 5 times this much because it will disappear
incredibly fast. Also, I recommend the combo of peanuts, cashews and
pine nuts as an ideal mix. OINK.
