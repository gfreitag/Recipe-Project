1. Cut tomatoes in half crosswise and place them, cut side up, in a
close-fitting oven-proof dish. Season tomatoes to taste with salt and
pepper, and drizzle with 2 Tbs of the olive oil. Bake in a 4450 F oven
until heated through but still firm, about 15 mins. 2. About 3 mins
before tomatoes are done, pour 1 Tbs olive oil into a wide frying pan
and place over high heat. When oil is hot, add the shrimp and stir
often until they are pink and firm, 2 to 3 mins. Add salt and pepper
to taste. 3. Transfer the baked tomatoes to individual serving
dishes. Place the sauteed shrimp on top of the tomatoes, dividing
them evenly. Keep warm. 4. In a small pan over high heat, combine the
garlic and the remaining 3 Tbs olive oil. Stir often until the garlic
turns golden brown, about 1 min. 5. Add vinegar to pan, and stir to
dislodge any browned bits, about 30 seconds. Immediately pour mixture
over the tomatoes and sauteed shrimp. Sprinkle parsley and cayenne
evenly over the shrimp mixture, and serve at once. Makes 4 servings.
