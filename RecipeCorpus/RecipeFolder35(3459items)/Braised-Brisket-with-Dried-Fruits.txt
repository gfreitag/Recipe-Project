Preheat the oven to 325øF. Heat the oil in a non-stick fry pan. cook
the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic over medium heat for 4-5
minutes, or until golden.

Transfer the vegetables to a large roasting pan. Add the brisket,
port, stock and bouquet garni. Bring the liquid to a boil on the
stovetop. Tightly cover the pan and bake the brisket in the oven for
1« hours.

Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and thinly slice it on the
diagonal. Return the brisket to the roasting pan and stir in the dried
fruit. Make sure the fruit is submerged in the cooking liquid. Add
stock as necessary to cover it completely. Cover the pan and bake for
1-2 hours or until the meat is tender. Add stock or water as
necessary to keep the meat and fruit moist. If there's too much
cooking liquid, uncover the pan for the last half hour to allow some
of it to evaporate.

Arrange the meat on a platter. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the
fruit to the platter around the meat. Skim the fat off and pour the
gravy into a gravy boat. Spoon some of the gravy over the meat and
fruit, serving the rest on the side. Garnish with parsley.
