Title: Smoked Trout Quiche
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Bbq/grill, Pie/tart, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Onion; minced
1 tb Butter
1 tb Lemon rind; grated
Salt and pepper
1    Recipe rich pie pastry
1/4 lb Hot smoked lake trout
1/2 lb Cream cheese
5    Eggs
1 c  Heavy cream
Prepare enough pastry for a 9" pie shell and bake it.

Soften the cream cheese. Beat the eggs slightly, reserving 2 tb. Mix
the eggs, cream, cream cheese, mustard, lemon rind, salt and pepper.
Saute the onions in butter, then add the flaked fish to the pan and
cook it until it has warmed and absorbed the butter. Brush the pie
shell with the reserved egg and put it in the oven to glaze, 2 min.
Arrange the salmon-onion mixture in the shell and pour the egg-cream
mixture over it. Bake at 350 for 30 min or until the quiche passes
the custard clean knife test in the middle.  Cool until lukewarm
before serving.
