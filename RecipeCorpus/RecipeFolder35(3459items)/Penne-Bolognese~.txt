In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil until hot but not smoking, over
medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened,
about 5 minutes. Stir in carrot, celery, and 1/3 cup water; cook
until vegetables are tender and liquid has evaporated, about 5
minutes longer. Stir in ground beef and cook until no longer pink,
about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook until the liquid has evaporated,
about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, 2/3 cup of milk, salt, pepper
and oregano, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until
the milk has been absorbed. Continue to cook until the sauce is thick
and creamy, gradually adding the remaining 1 cup milk until all has
been absorbed, about 20 minutes longer. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a
large pot of boiling water until just tender. Drain well. Transfer
sauce to a large bowl. Add the pasta, parsley, if desired, and
Parmesan and toss to combine. Spoon into 4 serving bowls and serve.
