Title: Whole Dried Pea PurÂ‚e with Shallots, Herbs and Spices
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Dried marjoram
1/8 ts Dried tarragon
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tb Soft butter
Freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 lb Whole dried peas, soaked
2 1/2 c  Unsalted chicken stock
4    Whole cloves
4 lg Shallots
1 sm Whole dried red chile
Drain the soaked peas and put them into a 3-qt. non-stick saucepan.
Add the chicken stock. Stick a clove into each shallot and add to
saucepan along with the hot chile pod. Bring to a boil, lower heat,
cover and simmer for 50-60 minutes until the peas are very soft. Turn
off heat, remove and discard hot chile and cloves, returning shallots
to pan. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon to incorporate the
shallots, then stir in the marjoram, tarragon, salt, pepper and
butter. Turn heat on again and simmer 5-10 minutes more, stirring
occasionally. The mixture should be very thick and all the liquid
should be absorbed. Taste and correct seasoning, then grate a little
nutmeg on the surface. Serve as a side dish with any meat, fish, or
poultry dish.
