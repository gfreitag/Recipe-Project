are white-hot, lay vegetables (except tomatoes) on grill and cook for
2 minutes each side. Then cook tomatoes for 30 seconds on each side.
Spoon 3 ounces Pepper Vinaigrette onto each plate and arrange
vegetables on top of vinaigrette. Sprinkle with queso fresco and
serve with salsa and fresh tortillas.
