"The tradtition of meatless Christmas Eve meal is one that Italian-
Americans maintained long after they blended into the "melting pot".
Originally, this meal consisted of seven fish courses which might have
signified the seven sacraments or the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost
or some other religious commemoration.  The fish was served with any
number of meatless dishes such as this pasta.  Gradually, the
immigrants altered their ancestors' menu, adding or eliminating fish
dishes as their environment dictated.  The meal was one of the most
steadfast of Italian traditions and many Italian-Americans continue
today to gather the night before Christmas for the 'great fish
feast.'  This delicious recipe is often part of that meal." 1 pound
vermicelli or thin spaghetti 1/2 cup 2 cloves  garlic, minced 1/2 cup
1/3 cup pignoli nuts 2 Tbl Salt and pepper extra-virgin olive oil
dark or light raisins minced fresh parsley

Stir the vermicelli or spaghetti into 5 quarts of rapidly boiling
salted water.  Heat the olive oil, garlic, raisisn, and pignolis
until the garlic is golden and the raisins are plumped.  Stir in the
parsley, salt and pepper.  Drain the pasta when cooked al dente and
toss into the warm oil. Serve immediately. Serve 4 to 6. [ "We Called
