Title: Sharon's Pancakes
Categories: Pcake/waffl, Breakfast
Yield: 1 batch
1 ea Beaten egg
1 c  Milk
1 tb Oil
1/4 c  Melted margarine
1 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
2 ts Sugar
NOTE:  I normally double or triple this recipe, since the pancakes I
make are normally quite large.

In a large bowl, stir together all the dry ingredients. In seperate
bowl, mix together the beaten egg, milk and melted margarine.  Slowly
pour into the dry ingredients and combine until batter is mixed, but
slightly lumpy. Allow to sit for about 5-6 minutes to allow the
baking powder to start working, and then pour into hot oiled skillet.
Cooking over medium heat, wait until no more bubbles 'pop' on the
uncooked side, and then flip over. Heat should be low enough to
prevent burning, but high enough to make bubbles pop.  Keep cooked
pancakes in a towel lined pan in a 225F oven until all batter is
cooked.  Serve with syrup, or after cooled, jam. Origin: Sharon
