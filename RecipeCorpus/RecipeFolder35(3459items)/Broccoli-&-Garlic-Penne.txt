Title: Broccoli & Garlic Penne
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 8 servings
Black pepper -- to taste
4 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese -- freshly
-grated
1 lb Penne
2    Heads broccoli
3/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
10    Cloves garlic -- thinly
-sliced
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the penne, and cook at a
rolling boil until the pasta is just tender.  Drain, rinse until cold
water, drain again and reserve.  Cut the broccoli florets into fairly
small pieces. Reserve the stems for another use.  Bring a large
saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the broccoli, and simmer for 2
minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, pat dry and reserve.  Pour
th oil into a large skillet, and heat over medium heat until it
begins to ripple, about 1 minute. Add the garlic slices and cook,
shaking the pan, until the garlic begins to brown around the edges,
another minute.  Add the broccoli to the skillet, stir well, sprinkle
with black pepper and cook 2 minute longer, shaking the skillet. Add
the butter and penne to the broccoli and cook, stirring often, until
the penne is well mixed with the broccoli, oil and garlic and the
mixture is hot--3 to 4 minutes.  Place in a serving dish, sprinkle
with the cheese and serve immediately.  Pass the pepper mill.
