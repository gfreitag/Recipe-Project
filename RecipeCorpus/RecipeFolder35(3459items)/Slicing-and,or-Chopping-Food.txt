Q: Does the method used to slice or chop food affect the taste?

A: Yes. You release the flavor of fruits and vegetables when you
slice, chop, or crush them. The action cuts the plant cells, which
have different chemical substances sealed off in different sections.
When you cut a cell, compounds freed from one part of the cell mix
with substances in other parts to produce different tastes. The
flavor changes according to how many times you tear the cells. For
example, a whole garlic clove has a mild flavor when cooked; a
slightly crushed clove has more flavor, a sliced clove even more, and
a chopped clove the most. Equipment that produces greater or lesser
degrees of cell damage will yield different results. A food mill will
crush fewer cells than a blender or food processor and therefore give
a somewhat milder taste to foods.
