3 tb Parsley, chopped
1 1/2 ts Celery seeds
2/3 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Cold water
2 ts Cold water
1 ea Egg, slightly beaten
6 lb Rib eye roast *
4 oz Mushrooms, drained, chopped
1/2 c  Onion, fine chopped
2 tb Butter, melted
8 oz Liverwurst
3 c  Flour, sifted
1 ts Salt
* A 6-8 pound whole tenderloin of beef or 5 pound center cut of filet

Tie meat securely if you use a folded filet.  Insert meat thermometer

reaches 140 degrees (rare).  Cool, wrap and refrigerate.

The next day saute mushrooms and onion in butter until onion is
tender. Combine with Liverwurst and mix.  Chill.

shortening until mixture is consistency of tiny peas.  Sprinkle on
cold water 1 tbs at a time, tossing with a fork.

Shape dough into a rectangle about 1\8 inch thick, measuring 2 inches
wider than the length of the roast, 2 inches longer than the
circumference. Save pastry scraps.

Remove string from cold roast.  Pat Liverwurst mixture onto roast,
covering top and sides only.

Place roast, coated side down, on pastry rectangle.  Fold up pastry
to meet along center top and ends.  Trim off  extra pastry, moisten
edges and press together firmly to seal well.

Place pastry covered roast, sealed edges down (Liverwurst side is now
up) in a greased shallow pan.

pieces with beaten egg and seal to top of roast in attractive design.

roast from pan, and let stand 15 minutes prior to carving.
