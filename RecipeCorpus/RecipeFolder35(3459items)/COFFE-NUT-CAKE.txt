Title: COFFE NUT CAKE
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 cake
Pinch of salt
Coffee butter cream
Chopped walnuts
Coffee glace icing
6 oz Butter or margarine
6 oz Caster sugar
3 lg Eggs
6 oz Plain flour
3/4 ts Baking powder
Grease and line 2 7-in. sandwich tins. Cream the butter and sugar
until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs one at a time. Sift the
flour, baking powder and salt and fold in a little at a time. Divide
the mixture equally between the prepared tins and bake in the centre
of the oven at 350F for about 30 minutes, until golden brown and firm
to the touch. Turn out the cakes and cool on a wire rack. Make some
butter cream with 3 oz. butter and 6 oz. sifted icing sugar and add
sufficient coffee essence to give a good flavour. Sandwich the layers
together with the butter cream and use the remainder to coat the
sides of the cake. Roll the sides in chopped walnuts and coat the top
with glace icing flavoured with coffee essence; decorate with chopped
walnuts. Submitted By JAMES LEAR   On   10-08-95
