Lively green and red colors make this a festive dish. The garlicky
dressing clings to the ridges of the pasta.

1 bunch fresh broccoli, thick stems removed and cut into small
florets 1 pound uncooked dry imported fusilli (corkscrew pasta) 1 cup
fresh parsley leaves 1 clove garlic, peeled 1/2 cup extra virgin
olive oil 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar Salt and freshly ground black
pepper to taste 1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and thinly
sliced

1. Place the broccoli florets in a large mixing bowl, cover with cold
water, and allow to stand for 30 minutes. Drain. Place the broccoli
in a medium-size saucepan fitted with a steamer basket or tray over
boiling water. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Drain and refresh under
cold water. Set aside.

2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add a
tablespoon of salt and the fusilli and cook, stirring occasionally,
for 7 to 10 minutes, until tender but firm, al dente Drain well and
transfer to a large mixing bowl.

3. Combine the parsley and garlic in a food processor fitted with the
steel blade. Turn the machine on and process for about 15 seconds,
until the parsley and garlic are finely chopped. With the machine
running, add the olive oil in a steady stream and the vinegar. Pour
over the pasta, mix well, and allow to cool to room temperature. Add
the broccoli to the pasta, season with salt and pepper, and toss to
combine. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the red pepper
slices.
