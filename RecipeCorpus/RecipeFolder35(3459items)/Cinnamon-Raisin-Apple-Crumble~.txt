cloves and salt. Use your fingers to rub in the butter until mixture
resembles coarse meal. Set aside. In an 8x8-inch non-aluminum baking
pan stir together the apples, raisins, sugar, apple cider and lemon
juice. Pat the filling into an even layer. Sprinkle the reserved
topping over the apples and bake for 20 minutes. Use a spatula or
table knife to make cuts through the crumble all across the top,
dispersing the juices into the topping. Bake for an additional 25
minutes, until nicely browned and bubbling. Place on a rack and let
cool about 15 minutes. Spoon into bowls, top each with a 1/2 cup of
frozen yogurt and serve.
