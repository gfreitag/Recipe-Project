* yellow or red can also be used, but use thick-walled Dutch peppers
only

* or substitute 3/4 cup dried black beans and 3/4 cup small white
beans, cooked separately.

Peppers: Preheat oven to broil. Cut off a thin slice from the bottoms
of the peppers so that they will stand upright. Slice off about
Â«-inch from the top stem and cut out the seeds and ribs from the
pepper interiors. Lay the peppers of their sides and slip them under
the broiler, turning occasionally to char the surface skin all over.
Do not overcook or the peppers will collapse. Slip them into a paper
bag for 5 minutes, then scrape off the charred skin and set the
peppers aside.

Beans: To a 3-qt. saucepan, add beans, onion, carrot and celery
stalk. Tie the bay leaf, thyme and parsley together with string and
add to the pot. Add warm water to cover beans by 2 inches. Bring to a
boil, skim surface foam, cover and lower the heat. Simmer for about
25 minutes or until beans are tender but maintain their shape. Lift
out and discard the vegetables and herb bouquet. Drain and rinse
beans in warm water. Season with salt. Gently mix beans with cilantro
vinaigrette while still warm.

Cilantro Vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar,
mustard, salt, pepper, cumin and garlic. Whisk in the olive oil and
cilantro. Makes 2/3 cup.

To Finish: When beans have reached room temperature, gently stir in
the diced cheese and pepperoni and fill each pepper. Place each
pepper on a lettuce leaf if desired and serve at room temperature.

If you prefer, prepare and stuff the peppers well ahead of time. Wrap
them in plastic wrap and refrigerate; bring them to room temperature
before serving.
