1 c  Shortening
1 c  Sugar
6 ea Eggs
2 ts Salt
4 tb Butter or margarine --
Melted
2 pk Active dry yeast -- 1/4
oz Each
1/3 c  Warm water -- 110 to 115

2 c  Warm milk -- 110 to 115 deg
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add 4 cups flour,
milk, shortening, sugar, eggs and salt; beat for 2 minutes or until
smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a
foured board; knead lightly. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to
grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about
2-3 hours. Punch dough down; divide into four equal parts. Roll each
into a 9-in. circle; brush with butter. Cut each circle into eight
pie shaped wedges; roll up each wedge from wide edge to tip of dough
and pinch to seal. Place rolls, tip down, on baking sheets; freeze.
When frozen, place in freezer bags and keep frozen until needed. To
bake, place on greased baking sheets; thaw 5 hours or until doubled
in size. Bake at 375 deg. for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.
Remove from baking sheets and serve immediately or cool on wire
racks. Yield: 32 rolls
