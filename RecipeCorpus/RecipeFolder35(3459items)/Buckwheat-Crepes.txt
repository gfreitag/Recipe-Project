Title: Buckwheat Crepes
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
2/3 c  White flour
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Melted butter
1 c  Water
1 c  Milk
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Buckwheat flour
Buckwheat pancakes are great, but here's something a little more
elegant: buckwheat crepes. Serve them with melted butter and cinnamon
sugar.

TO MAKE BATTER IN A BLENDER, put all ingredients into a blender jar in
order given, and blend briefly at medium speed. Stop and scrape down
the sides of the blender jar; then blend for another 5 seconds or so.
Pour out the batter into a bowl, cover and let rest for 1 hour before
using. To make batter by hand, beat the eggs slightly, add milk,
water, salt and melted butter, then gradually whisk in flours. Pour
the batter through a strainer and let sit for 1/2 hour before using.
To cook crepes, melt a little butter in a crepe pan and cook. As
buckwheat has an enormous capacity to absorb liquid, you might find
it necessary to thin the batter with more milk or water.
