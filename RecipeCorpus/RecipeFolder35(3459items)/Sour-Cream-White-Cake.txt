Title: Sour Cream White Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Amaretto
Or 1 tsp almond extract
8 oz Sour cream
1/4 c  Milk
1 c  Butter -- softened
2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
2 3/4 c  Flour
Combine sour cream and milk (Or strained yogurt and milk.)

Cream butter and sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly
between additions.

Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.  Add to
creamed butter alternately with sour cream/milk mixture in three
additions, beginning and ending with flour mixture.  Stir in vanilla
and amaretto or almond extract.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake
pans.

Pour batter into prepared pans and bake for 35-45 minutes, until a
toothpick inserted in the center of cake comes out clean. Cool in
pans 10 minutes before removing to wire racks. Cool completely before
frosting.

The original recipe called for sour cream, but I love the taste with
yogurt.  One caveat - when using yogurt, you need to thicken it up or
the cake will never bake through.  Put 1 1/2 cups of yogurt in a
yogurt funnel or a sieve lined with two layers of cheesecloth and let
it drain off 1/2 cup of liquid before you start.
