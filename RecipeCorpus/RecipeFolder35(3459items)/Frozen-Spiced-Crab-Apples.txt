Title: Frozen Spiced Crab Apples
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 1 pint
6    Whole cloves
1/8 ts Salt
3    Strips lemon peel
16 sm Crab apples, ripe
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Cold water
Use firm crab apples.  Wash and remove the blossom ends but leave
stems on.

Combine ingredients in saucepan; mix thoroughly.  Prick apple in
several places and put upright in saucepan and cover loosely.  Place
over low heat and cook 10 minutes.  Do not stir.  (Low heat prevents
apples from overcooking.)

Remove from heat and set in a cool place until cold.  Do not disturb
apples.

Pick up apples by the stems and pack in freezer containers (air
tight). Stagger them so that the second layer fits between the stems
of the first layer.  Strain juice in pan over apples, seal and
freeze. Let thaw 1-2 hours before serving.
