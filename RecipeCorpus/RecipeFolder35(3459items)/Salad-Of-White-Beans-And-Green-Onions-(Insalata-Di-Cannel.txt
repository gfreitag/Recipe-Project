This is my husband's favorite Saturday lunch, served with fresh crusty
bread. Tuna is traditional, but not essential. In Venice we ate it
with smoked tune roe, bottarga. 2 cups cooked white kidney beans or
one 16-ounce can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed 2 large
scallions, white and green parts, finely chopped One 3-ounce can
tuna, drained and flaked (optional) Salt and freshly ground black
pepper to taste 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon vinegar Combine
the beans, scallions, and tuna in a medium-size serving bowl, season
with salt and pepper, and add the olive oil and vinegar. Toss well
and serve.
