Broiled lamb chops are classic French bistro fare. Oven-roasted
potatoes are the ideal Gallic accompaniment.

Coriander-Orange Butter:  In a small bowl and using a fork, mash
together butter, chopped cilantro, ground coriander, orange zest and
salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Remove butter from refrigerator. Place a piece of plastic wrap 10
inches square on a work surface. Using a rubber spatula, mound butter
along the center of the plastic wrap. Drape one side of the plastic
wrap over the butter and then roll the butter into a tube shape about
1 inch in diameter and 3 inches long. Twist the ends of the plastic
wrap in opposite

directions, like a candy wrapper, and refrigerate until firm.

Preheat broiler (grill).
Brush lamb chops on both sides with olive oil and season to taste with
salt and pepper. Place on broiler pan. Broil 4 inches from heat
source. Broil (grill) until browned on the first side, about 5
minutes. Turn over lamb chops and continue to broil until browned on
the second side and pink when cut in the center, about 5 minutes
longer. Remove from broiler and place 2 lamb chops on each plate.
Remove butter from refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. Cut
butter into slices 1/4 inch thick. Place 1 slice on top of each lamb
chop. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and orange wedges and serve
immediately. Serves 6.
