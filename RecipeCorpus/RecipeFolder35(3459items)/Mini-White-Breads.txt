Title: Mini White Breads
Categories: Breads, Tasteofhome
Yield: 24 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
2 ts Butter or margarine --
Melted
Additional melted butter
1 pk (1/4 oz.) active dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1/3 c  Warm water (110-115
Degrees)
2 1/4 c  (to 2 1/2 cups) flour
Combine yeast, sugar and water in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups
of flour, salt, milk and butter.  Mix for 3 minutes on medium speed.
Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured
board; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes.  Place in a
greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.  Punch dough down. Divide
in half; shape into two loaves and place in greased 5 3/4 x 3 1/8 x 2
1/4" pans.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake
at 375 degrees for 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from
pans; cool on wire racks. Brush tops with melted butter.  Note:  This
recipe looks like it would work beautifully in a bread machine on the
dough cycle.  You might want to watch it as it mixes to make sure a
nice ball is forming and add more flour or liquids as needed.  Be
sure that melted butter has cooled! You could probably bake it in the
bread machine as a single loaf too.  Yields: 2 loaves.
