Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Fresh thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Beef stock
1/3 c  Madeira wine
3 c  Cooked whole wheat berries
2 tb Chives, minced
1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms
1/3 c  Boiling water
1/2 c  Sliced almonds
1/2 lb Mixed wild mushrooms *
1/2 c  Shallots, minced
2    Garlic clove(s), minced
* combo of any three: chanterelles, morels, shiitake, hedgehog,
cremini

Put the porcini mushrooms in a cup and pour the boiling water over
them. Steep for 20 minutes. Drain liquid and mushrooms through a
coffee filter into a cup. Squeeze filter to extract most of the
liquid from the mushrooms and reserve the liquid. Remove the
mushrooms, cut into small pieces and set aside.

In a 12-inch non-stick skillet, melt 1 tbs of butter. Add almonds and
toast for 1-2 minutes, until they just begin to color. Remove with a
slotted spoon and set aside.

Wipe wild mushrooms with a damp paper towel or a soft brush. Trim
tough parts of stem, slice mushrooms thickly and set aside.

Add another 1 tbs butter to the skillet and sautÂ‚ the shallots   and
garlic for 4-5 minutes over medium heat, until soft but not browned.
Remove to a plate. Melt remaining butter in same skillet and add the
wild mushrooms, thyme, salt and pepper, reserved porcini mushrooms
and the mushroom liquid. Add the beef stock and the wine and bring to
a boil. Cover skillet and simmer for 8 minutes. Stir in the cooked
wheat berries, cover and continue to simmer until the berries are
warmed, about 5-8 minutes. The berries will absorb the sauce. When
ready to serve, gently mix in the reserved almonds, spoon the mixture
into a serving dish and garnish with chives.
