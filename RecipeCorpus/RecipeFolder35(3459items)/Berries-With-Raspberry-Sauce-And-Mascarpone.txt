A berry lover's delight- just fresh, sweet summer berries and some
mascarpone for a touch of richness.

1 quart fresh strawberries, stemmed and cut in half lengthwise 1 pint
fresh blueberries 2 pints fresh raspberries (or 1 pint each
raspberries and blackberries) 1/2 cup confectioners sugar 2 cups
mascarpone 1/4 cup plain yogurt

1. Combine the berries in a large mixing bowl, reserving 1 pint of the
raspberries to make a sauce.

2. Combine the remaining pint of raspberries with the sugar in a
blender or food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process for
about 30 seconds, until the raspberries are smooth and the sugar is
dissolved.

3. Combine the mascarpone and yogurt in a small mixing bowl. Using a
wire whisk, beat until the mixture is smooth.

4. To serve, spoon some of the raspberry sauce onto each individual
serving plate. Place some of the berry mixture over the sauce and top
with a heaping tablespoon of the mascarpone.
