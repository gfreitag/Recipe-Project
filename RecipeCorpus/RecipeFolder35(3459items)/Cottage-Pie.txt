Simmer 1 chopped onion in a non-stick pan, add 1 1/2 lb. ground
venison (or beef), 1 bay leaf, salt, pepper, 2 cloves of garlic.
Cook the mixture over a medium heat until the meat gives out its
juices and loses its raw look.  Add 1 small can of tomato sauce, 1
cube beef bouillon, 2 grated raw carrots (grated large).  Cover and
simmer for 1 hour.  Add chopped parsley. Next step, the topping:

Boil and mash 5 potatoes.  Add butter, buttermilk and skim milk.
If the meat mixture has accumulated too much liquid, pour some off so
that the meat is juicy but not covered with liquid.  Cover the meat
in an ovenwear casserole with the mashed potatoes.  Bake till heated
through and golden.  For a final moment, put under the broiler.
