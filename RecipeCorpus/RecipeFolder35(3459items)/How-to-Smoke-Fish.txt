1. Prepare your seafood as needed. Remove pin-bones from fillets, if
desired. Steam clams or mussels just until they are opened, Add
shucked oysters to simmering water and poach for 1 minute.

2. Prepare the brine, thoroughly mixing the ingredient so they are
evenly distributed. Add the seafood to the wet brine, or sprinkle
with dry brine. Let sit for about 2 hours, refrigerated if ambient
temperature is warm. Very large pieces of fish may be brined
overnight if desired. Remember that clams, oysters and mussels need
only about 10 minutes in brine.

3. Rinse the seafood and discard the brine. Pat dry with paper
towels. For shellfish, move directly to the smoking process. For
other seafoods, allow to air-dry for 1-2 hours.

4. Soak your choice of wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes.
Allow about 20 minutes for a charcoal fire to preheat, less time for
electric or gas smokers. Prepare a water pan if needed.

5. When the smoker is preheated, add the wood chips. Add the seafood
to the racks and smoke until just cooked.
