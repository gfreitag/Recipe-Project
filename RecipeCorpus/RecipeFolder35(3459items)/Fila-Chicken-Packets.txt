Title: Fila Chicken Packets
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 ts Dried tarragon
3    Cloves garlic -- minced
2/3 c  Butter or margarine
12    Sheets fila dough -- thawed
2 tb Parmesan cheese -- grated
6    Skinless boneless chicken
Breast halves
3/4 c  Green onion -- thinly
Sliced
3/4 c  Mayonnaise
3 tb Lemon juice
Rinse chicken and pat dry; set aside.  In a bowl, mix onions,
mayonaise, lemon juice, tarragon and 2 cloves garlic; set aside.
Combine remaining 1 clove garlic with butter.  To make each packet,
place one sheet of fila on a flat surface and brush with about 2 tsp
of the garlic butter.  Put a second sheet on top and brush with 2
more tsp garlic butter.  Sprinkle all sides of one chicken piece with
salt and pepper, then spread one side with 1 1/2 tbsp of the
mayonaise mixture.  Place chicken, mayonaise side down, in center of
fila about 2" from one end.  Spread chicken with 1 1/2 more tbsp
mayonaise mixture.  Flip end of fila over chicken and roll once; then
fold long sides over chicken and roll up completely.  Brush packets
with remaining garlic butter and sprinkle with cheese. (At this
point, you may arrange packets in a single layer in a container with
a tight fitting lid and freeze for up to 1 month.  Thaw completely,
covered, before baking.) Arrange fila packets, seam side down and
slightly apart, in a 10 x 15" rimmed baking pan.  Bake in a 375 oven
until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.  661 calories and 45
