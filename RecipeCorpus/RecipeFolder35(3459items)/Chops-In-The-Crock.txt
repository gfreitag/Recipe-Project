Title: Chops In The Crock
Categories: Meats, Crockpot
Yield: 1 servings
Undiluted soup, and slow
Cook all day.  The
Soup makes a great sauce for
The porkchops. I usually
Serve it with
Augratin potatoes.
Ok, here goes....I put the
Porkchops in layers in the
Crockpot,
Separating each layer with
UNDILUTED Cream of Mushroom
Soup, then cover
The whole thing with more
