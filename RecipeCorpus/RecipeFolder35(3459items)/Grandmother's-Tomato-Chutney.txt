* This recipe is to be processed in a boiling water bath.
Instructions for how to do this are with the recipe for "Tomato Jam",
which is in this cookbook.

1. Scald tomatoes in boiling water, cool and peel.

2. Pare apples, peel onions, core peppers; chop all in fairly large
pieces.

3. Combine all ingredients in HEAVY covered kettle or pan and simmer
for about 2 hours or until mixture is thick. Stir often to prevent
sticking.

4. Pour while boiling hot into hot, sterile jars. See manufacturer's
directions for how to sterilize canning jars. Leave 1/4-inch of head
space. Process for 10 minutes in boiling water bath.

This recipe is handed down to me by my mother, Lillian Childers of
Mississippi.
