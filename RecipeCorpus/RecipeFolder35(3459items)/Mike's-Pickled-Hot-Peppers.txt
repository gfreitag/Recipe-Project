Title: Mike's Pickled Hot Peppers
Categories: Can/preserv, Condiments, Appetizers, Chilies, Pickles
Yield: 4 pints
Sliced thin
Salt, to taste
5 c  Oil, 1/2 olive, 1/2 corn
2 lb Hot Peppers
5 c  White vinegar
2 tb Oregano, fresh leaves
8 md Garlic cloves, peeled,
1.  Slice the Hot Peppers crosswise into 1/4 inch slices, with the
seeds. Set aside in a glass bowl. 2. In a medium saucepan, bring
the vinegar to a simmer.  Pour over
the peppers and let stand for 25 minutes.  Drain and discard the
vinegar. 3. Add the oregano, garlic, salt, and 4 cups of oil to
the bowl.  Toss
and transfer the peppers with a slotted spoon to 4 perfectly clean
pint jars, leaving a 1/2 inch headspace.  Pack down firmly.  Pour
the oil over the peppers, leaving a 1/4 inch headspace. Tap gently
on countertop to remove any air bubbles.  Let the jars sit at room
temperature, uncovered, overnight. 4. The next day, again, tap
gently on counter to remove any visible air
bubbles.  If the oil has settled so that the peppers are exposed,
fill the jars with a little more oil to cover the peppers
completely.
Seal tightly and store in a cool place for 3-4 months before
opening.

Remarks:  There is no need to boil the jars of peppers in a water bath
since the peppers are completely immersed in oil.

NOTES:  I grow five different kinds of peppers in my side yard each
year. Jalapeno's, Anneheim's, Sweet Bannana, Hungarian Hot Wax, and
Serrano's. As they ripen, I use whatever combination of peppers that
are ready, so each batch of pickled peppers comes out a little
different as far as heat goes. Also, the original recipe called for
only 4 cloves of garlic, I increased it to 8.  I won a Blue Ribbon
for this recipe at the Clark County, Washington, Fair 1989.
