1. In microwave-safe cup, melt chocolate and set aside to cool. In
medium-size bowl, combine flour, cocoa, and baking powder; set aside.

2. In large bowl, with electric mixer on md speed, beat butter and

placing egg white in a cup, then cover and refrigerate.

floured hand, divide dough into 3 equal pieces. Shape each into a
10-inch-long log and place across large baking sheet or lengthwise on
small sheets. Flatten each log until 2 inches in diameter and brush
with reserved egg white.

5. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until firm. Cool logs on wire rack 30
minutes. Transfer logs to cutting board. Using serrated knife and a
sawing motion, cut each log diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Ar- range slices cut side down on baking sheet.

surface. Cool slices on wire rack and store in airtight container.
