Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Firmly packed dark brown
-sugar
1 c  Plus 2 tablespoons flour,
-sifted
4 1/2 oz Coarsely chopped white
-chocolate
1/2 lb Unsalted butter, at room

1. Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan. Using a food processor fitted with a
metal blade, chop the white chocolate using on-off pulses, until it
resembles coarse meal. 2. Using an electric mixer set at medium
speed, cream the butter with the sugar in a large bowl until smooth.
Beat in the flour. Stir in the chopped white chocolate. 3. Pat the
dough evenly into the prepared pan. Using the tip of a sharp knife,
score the dough into eight equal triangles. 4. Bake the shortbread
until light golden in color, about 30 minutes. Transfer in the pan to
a wire rack to cool slightly. Remove the shortbread from the pan and
cool completely on the wire rack. Store in an airtight container at
room temperature.

Do ahead: The shortbread can be made up to 2 weeks in advance, or
frozen up to 1 month.
