Title: Pitts Chocolate Covered Strawberries
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
Grand Mariner or other
-orange flavored liquer
Semi sweet choc baking chips
Strawberries; biggest and
-reddest available, washed
-hulls left on
Use a small syringe (available at culinary arts supply store, but
Kathy usually talks her vet out of a new syrings suitable for
injecting small animals), to inject a small amount of Grand Mariner
into each berry.

Melt choc chips in double boiler over hot water.

Dip each berry, pointed end first, in the chocolate, allowing the
choc to cover about half the berry (some of the red should still be
visible.

Place the dipped berries in individual candy cups (available in the
baking supply section of supermarket) and refrigerate until needed.
They'll keep nicely for a day, but I wouldn't want to hold them any
longer than that. Recipe by Kathy Pitts
