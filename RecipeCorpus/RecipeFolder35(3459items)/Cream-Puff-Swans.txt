Title: Cream Puff Swans
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 cn Mandarin orange slices --
-well-drained
1 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Powdered sugar -- sifted
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
4    Eggs
Substitute 1 cup fresh or frozen berries, sweetened if desired, for
oranges.

Melt butter in water and bring to a boil. Sift flour with salt and
add to butter mixture. Heat, stirring, until mixture forms a ball.
Remove from heat and add eggs, one at a time, beating well between
each addition. Put 1/3 of dough into a pastry bag and pipe through
largest hole onto greased baking sheet, forming six S-shaped
pastries, each about 3 inches long. These will form necks and heads
of swans. Scrape any dough remaining in pastry bag into rest of
dough. On a separate, greased baking sheet, form remaining dough into
six ovals, drawing dough to a point at one end and rounding other end
of oval. These will be bodies of swans. Place baking sheet with oval
cream puffs into the oven at 425 degrees and bake for 10 minutes.
Place the other baking sheet in oven and continue to bake both
batches of dough another 10 minutes. Turn oven down to 350 degrees
and bake 5 minutes more, or until "heads" of swans are done. Bake
"bodies" 5-10 minutes longer or until done.

As baking sheets are removed from oven, remove pastries to racks to
cool. Cool completely. Cut an oval from the top of each "body" and
cut in half. Scoop any uncooked dough from "bodies". Whip cream until
stiff. Beat in powdered sugar, to taste.

Put a spoonful of well-drained Mandarin oranges in each "body",
dividing equally among the six. Top with equal amounts of whipped
cream. Place S-shapes in whipped cream at rounded ends to form neck
and head. Place half-ovals in whipped cream behind "necks" to form
wings. Serve at once.
