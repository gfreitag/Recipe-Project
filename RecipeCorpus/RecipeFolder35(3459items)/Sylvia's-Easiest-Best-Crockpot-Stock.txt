Water
1    Turkey or chicken carcass
MMMMM--------------------VEGETABLES OF CHOICE-------------------------
2    Carrots
1    Onions
MMMMM----------------------HERBS OF CHOICE---------------------------
2 tb Oregano leaves
1 tb Rosemary leaves
Water
1 ts Celery seed; or stalks
2    Bay leaves
2 tb Parsley
1 tb Sage leaves
Cram as much of turkey carcass & leavings as will fit into crockpot.
(I usually only manage to get about 1/2 of a carcass in.)  Use all the
leavings, including skin, even if you plan on defatting the stock. Add
remaining ingredients and cover with water to within an inch or so of
the top.  Cover crockpot and cook on low at least 2-3 DAYS (not a
tyop!). Strain out solids, package in pints or quarts, and freeze
until needed.

Sylvia's comments: This recipe, that I developed, is the easiest I've
ever seen, and it produces the richest, most flavorful stock.  If it's
inconvenient to let it cool and package it after 3 days, let it cook
another day or so until it is convenient.  You can't overcook it (at
least I haven't managed to), the longer it cooks the richer it gets.
I do check it every day or so to see if I need to add water, but I
rarely have to. Since the stock is unsalted, it is great for anyone
trying to restrict sodium intake.  And it tastes so good that I try
to snag turkey or chicken carcasses whenever I can.  Let others take
home the meat and stuffing, I want the carcass!  <g>  I also make
stock from the bones of the whole KFC Rotisserie Gold chicken we buy
occasionally.
