You'll need all the basic equipment for steam pressure canning to can
your lentils.

1. Choose only young tender lentils.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

4. COLD PACK: Pack lentils loosely into hot jars to within 1 inch of
tops of pint jars, 1-1/2 inches of tops of quarts. Don't press down
or shake lentils to pack more in the jars. They need space to expand
as they cook. If desired, add 1/2 teaspoon salt to pint jars, 1
teaspoon salt to quarts. Pour in boiling water to within 1 inch of
tops of jars. HOT PACK: Cook lentils in just enough boiling water to
cover for 3 minutes. Pack lentils into hot jars to within 1 inch of
tops. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to pint jars, 1 teaspoon to quarts, if
desired. Pour in boiling water to within 1 inch of tops of jars.

5. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling liquid to fill to within 1 inch
of tops.

6. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

7. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

8. Process at 10 pounds pressure, 55 minutes for pints, 1 hour and 5
minutes for quarts. Follow manufacturer's directions for your canner.
