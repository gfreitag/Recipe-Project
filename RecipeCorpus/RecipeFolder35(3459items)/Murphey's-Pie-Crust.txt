Title: Murphey's Pie Crust
Categories: Pie/tart, Route 66
Yield: 1 servings
2/3 c  Shortening
1/4 c  Icy Cold Milk
2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
Mix flour and salt. Add shortening and mix with 2 knives or a pastry
blender until the mixture is the size of small peas. Add cold milk
gradually until dough can be gathered into a ball. (all of milk may
not be needed.) As soon as the dough holds together, stop handling.

Divide the dough into two balls and roll each one out from the center
in

each direction. For two single prebaked pie crusts, fit each circle of
pastry loosely into a pie pan. Build a rim and pinch with thumb and
forefinger. Prick well with fork and bake in preheated 450 F oven for
10 to 12 mins or until lightly browned. For a double crust pie, line
pie pan with one pastry circle, fill, and cover with the other circle
of pastry. Pinch all around to close. Makes 1 double pie crust or 2
single shells.
