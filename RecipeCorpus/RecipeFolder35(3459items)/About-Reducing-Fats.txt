Title: About Reducing Fats
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 text file  Some info to help with the low-fat portion of the diet:

In recipes for bread and similar baked goods, you can often substitute
applesauce for the fats, using the same amounts.  When it works, it
usually doesn't change the taste significantly.  However, you'll have
to test it one recipe at a time to find out which recipes it works
for, or look for recipes where someone else has already tested it.

For chicken and turkey, remove the skin before cooking and cut off any
visible fat.  Unless you have a pet capable of eating extra fat
without health problems, save the trimmings for the stock recipe
below, freezing them if necessary.

If you microwave chicken one piece at a time, it will come out
juicier if you use a lower power setting so you can cook it longer
without drying it out.  Also, add some chicken stock to help keep it
moist, and use a covered microwave dish.  One frozen stock cube (see
below) is about right for one piece of chicken.

Ground turkey is lower in fat than ground beef, and ground turkey
breast is especially low in fat.  It can be used in recipes that call
for ground beef when the softer texture of the ground turkey will not
be too noticeable.

Be prepared to reduce the amount of pepper used once you reduce fat
below a certain level.  I find that very low fat versions of recipes
make pepper taste stronger.
