Title: Sauted Porcini
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Butter
2 tb Shallots, finely chopped
1    Squeeze fresh lemon juice
1 tb Parsley, finely chopped
1 lb Fresh porcini, wiped clean
-with a soft cloth
1/2 c  Olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Cut the porcini caps into «-inch slices and chop the stems into small
dice.

Heat the olive oil in a heavy frying pan. When the oil is very hot,
add the caps in an even layer and fry until well browned, about 2
minutes per side. Turn the heat to low and cook another 4-5 minutes,
until tender. Increase the heat to high, and saut the slices for
another 1-2 minutes, until they're crisp again, turning once.
Transfer to a serving dish and season with salt and pepper.

Pour off all but 1 tbs oil from the pan (or pour if all off and start
with a fresh 1 tbs oil), return the pan to high heat, and add the
butter. When foaming, add the shallots and chopped porcini stems.
Season with a little salt and pepper and saut until lightly browned,
about 1 minute. Transfer to the cooked slices, squeeze on a little
lemon juice, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately with
toasted country bread.

Serves 4 as an appetizer.
