Several recipes from the book "Death by Chocolate" tell you to cool
the mixture in an ice-water bath. The effect of cooling food in an
ice-water bath is a quick and efficient lowering of room temperature.
Ice cream and sorbet bases need to be cooled before they are placed
in an ice-cream maker to facilitate the freezing process.

The simplest ice-water bath consists of a large stainless steel bowl
partically filled with ice and water. There should be enough ice and
water in the bowl so that the outside surface of the container to be
cooled will be surrrounded by ice and water. If the volume of the
container to be cooled is larger then can be accomodated by your
largest bowl, then consider using the kitchen sink. From the book
"Death by Chocolate" by Marcel Desaulniers AR/94
