Yield: 2 servings
Minutes,
Reserve water -- chop
Finely
1 c  Chopped fresh basil -- (or
More)
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Tamari -- (soy sauce)
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt -- (optional)
Pepper to taste
2 c  BowTie Pasta
1/2 c  Red wine
1 c  Sliced mushrooms
1/2 c  Chopped onion
2    Cloves Minced garlic
1/2 c  Shredded carrots
1 c  Red/yellow/green bell pepper
Chopped finely
8    To 10 Sundried tomatoes
- soak in
1/2 c  Boiling water -- for 30
Boil 1/2 c water and pour over sundried tomatoes.  Set aside for 30
minutes.  Bring 6 quarts of water to boil and add pasta, cooking 10-12
minutes until soft.

While tomatoes are soaking and pasta water is heating, chop mushrooms,
onion, and garlic and set aside.  Chop carrots, bell pepper and set
aside separately.  Chop sundried tomatoes when soft, set aside,
reserve water. Chop fresh basil.

Bring red wine to boil over medium heat in non-stick pan.  Add
mushrooms, onion, garlic and simmer with lid on for 5 minutes.  Add
carrots, bell pepper, and simmer with lid off another 5 minutes.  Add
sundried tomatoes, simmer another 5 minutes.  If wine evaporates too
much, add sundried tomato water as needed (or ordinary water if
necessary).  Add basil and other spices, stir and simmer until liquid
is simmered down to consistency you prefer, turn off heat and cover.

When pasta is done, drain, toss with above and serve.  Feeds two
hungry VLF vegetarians.
