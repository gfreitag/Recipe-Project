Title: Classic Roasted Peppers
Categories: Vegetables, Information
Yield: 1 batch
Olive oil
Red bell peppers
1. Preheat the oven to 400Ã¸F.

2. Rub the peppers lightly with olive oil. Place them on a cookie
sheet or in a shallow roasting pan and put them into the oven. Turn
every 10 minutes until the peppers are soft, wrinkled, and well
charred, about 30 minutes.

3. Put the peppers in a paper bag, close the bag, and let the peppers
cool for 10 minutes. (This makes them easier to peel.)

4. Holding the peppers over a bowl to catch the juices, peel the
charred skin from the peppers and discard. Remove and discard the
seeds. Save the juices. Never peel peppers under water; you'll lose
mush of their flavor.

Can be refrigerated for 3 or 4 days.
