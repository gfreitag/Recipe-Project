Title: Funghi Marinati (Marinated Mushrooms)
Categories: Italian, Vegetables, Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
4    Garlic cloves, minced
1    Bay leaf
1    Thyme sprig
2 tb Parsley, chopped
8    Cumin seeds
1 1/2 lb Mushrooms, fresh
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt
1 c  Vinegar
7 tb Olive oil
Remove and reserve stems of mushrooms, rub buttons with a clean cloth
to remove earth.  Put mushrooms in a saucepan with cold water
containing lemon juice and a little salt; bring to a gentle boil and
simmer for 10 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a bowl.  Combine
remaining ingredients in a saucepan and simmer over low heat for
about 1/2 hour.  Pour this marinade over the mushrooms and
refrigerate for at least 24 hours.  Drain off the marinade before
serving.

Note:  I make this recipe using mushrooms with the stems, making it
closer to what I remember when ordering marinated mushrooms as
antipasto from Italian cafes in southern Italian ports.
