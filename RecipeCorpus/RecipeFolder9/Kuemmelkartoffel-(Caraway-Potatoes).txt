Title: Kuemmelkartoffel (Caraway Potatoes)
Categories: Vegetables, German
Yield: 4 servings
Pepper to taste
1 tb Caraway seed
500 g  Potatoes (a generous lb)
1 l  Water (a generous quart)

Peel the raw potatoes, slice them, and boil in very salty water until
tender.  Drain the water.  Scatter the caraway seed over the potatoes,
cover, and on low heat, let dry for 2 to 3 minutes.  The potatoes are
served in a bowl, and frequently the cook would pour melted butter over
them.
