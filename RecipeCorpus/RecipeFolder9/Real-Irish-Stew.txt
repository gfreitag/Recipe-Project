Title: Real Irish Stew
Categories: Lamb, Soups/stews, Irish
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Potatoes
Salt and pepper
1 lb Onions
1 1/2 lb Mutton, cut into pieces
Parsley sprigs
6    Carrots, sliced
Place meat and vegetables in saucepan and cover with cold water. Add salt
and pepper as required and flavor with a few parsley sprigs and add carrot
slices. Slowly bring to a boil and skim off the top. Simmer over a very low
heat for approximately 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Note:You can
probably substitue lamb for the mutton and not need to cook as long. Also
this kind of dish is good for buffets as soups and stews keep well and
don't suffer for extended simmering.......8-)
