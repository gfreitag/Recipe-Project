Title: Dublin Lawyer (Irish)
Categories: Fish/sea, Irish
Yield: 6 servings
150 ml Cream
1    Salt and pepper
1    Fresh lobster/about 2 1/2 lb
3 tb Butter
4 tb Irish whiskey
Directions: The lobster should be cut in two down the center. Remove all
the meat from the lobster, including the claws: retain the shell for
serving.  Cut the meat into chunks. Heat the butter until foaming and
quickly saute the lobster chunks in it, until just cooked but not colored.
Warm the whiskey slightly, then pour it over the lobster and set fire to
it. Add the cream, mix with the pan juices, and taste for seasoning. Put
back into the half shells and serve hot.
