Title: Gelato Di Caffe
Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 8 servings
4 tb Instant espresso powder
1 c  Whipping cream
2/3 c  Sugar
4 c  Yolks
1 c  Milk; at room temperature
BEAT SUGAR AND EGG YOLKS together until pale yellow and very thick. Slowly
add milk, beating gently to avoid a build-up of foam. Stir in salt.
Transfer mixture to the top of a double boiler with an inch of boiling
water in the bottom half. Regulate heat so water remains at a low boil, and
stir continuously 8 minutes. Custard will thicken enough to coat the spoon,
and surface foam will disappear. Immediately remove top of double boiler
and set it in a large bowl of cold water. Stir 2 minutes to cool custard
somewhat. Then transfer it to a bowl and add espresso powder, stirring to
dissolve it thoroughly. Cover and set in refrigerator to chill thoroughly.
Also chill whipping cream. When ready to proceed, whip cream into soft
peaks and stir it into coffee custard. Transfer mixture to ice cream
machine and freeze according to machine's directions.
