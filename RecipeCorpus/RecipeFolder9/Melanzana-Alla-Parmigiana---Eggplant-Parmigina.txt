oven to 350 F/175 C. Slice the eggplants crossways into 1/2 inch/1 cm
slices.  Mix the flour with the salt, pepper and oregano and dredge the
eggplant slices. Then dip the slices in the beaten egg until well coated.
Heat the oil in a large fry pan and cook the eggplant for one minute on
each side over medium heat. Remove and drain. Pour a little of the tomato
sauce on the bottom of a casserole dish, and cover with a layer of the
eggplant slices. Grate half of the Mozzarella cheese, and mix together with
the Parmesan cheese, Bechamel sauce, and the remaining tomato sauce. Pour a
little of this mixture over the eggplant slices to cover, then add another
layer of eggplant slices. Continue this until all the eggplant and sauce is
used up. Slice the artichoke heats in half and place on top of the
eggplant. Slice the remaining Mozzarella cheese and top off the dish. Bake
in the oven for 40 minutes or until the top is bubbling. Turn off the heat
and let the dish sit in the oven for 5 minutes more.  Remove, cut into
large squares and serve. Serves 4. Source: Italian Gourmet Cooking
