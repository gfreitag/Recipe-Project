Title: Hummus Me Tahini (Chick Pea Salad with Tahini)
Categories: Appetizers, Greek, Mideast
Yield: 8 servings
2    Garlic cloves
1/2 ts Ground coriander (optional)
1/2 ts Ground cumin (optional)
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Chopped fresh parsley
1 c  Dried chick-peas
1/4 ts Baking soda
2 ts Tahini (or more)
1/3 c  Water
1    Lemon (juice only)
1/4 c  Olive oil
Wash the chick-peas, then soak overnight with the baking soda in cold water
to cover.  The following day, drain and wash the chick-peas, then cover
with fresh water.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until
tender, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  Drain and push through sieve or food mill,
discarding the coarse fibers remaining in the sieve.

Meanwhile, put the tahini in a small bowl and beat it with the 1/3 cup
water until dissolved, using a whisk or fork.  Beating briskly with the
whisk, add the tahini mixture, a teaspoonful at a time, to the chick-peas,
alternating with the lemon juice and olive oil.  When all has been added,
crush the garlic over the mixture and sprinkle with optional spices, salt,
pepper, and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley.  Beat for another minute, then
taste for seasonings and chill overnight - if possible.  Serve cold,
sprinkled with additional chopped parsley.  Makes about 2 cups.
