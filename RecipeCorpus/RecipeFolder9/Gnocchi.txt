Title: Gnocchi
Categories: Italian, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Grated romano cheese
4    Eggs, beaten
Pomodoro sauce (optional)
4 c  Milk
2 c  Semolina
1/2 c  Butter, room temperature
1 c  Grated parmesan cheese
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bring milk to boil in a 4 quart saucepan.
While milk is boiling, pour in semolina very slowly, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon to prevent lumps. Cook and stir 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
saucepan from heat and stir in butter.

Mix parmesan and romano cheeses together. Mix half of cheese with beaten
eggs and stir into semolina. Spread in a buttered 8 1/2" x 13" baking dish
and sprinkle remaining cheese over top.

Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cut into squares or diamond
shapes and serve. Accompany with sauce if desired. Serves 6.
