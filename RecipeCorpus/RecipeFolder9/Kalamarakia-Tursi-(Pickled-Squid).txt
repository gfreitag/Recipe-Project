Karen Mintzias
12 md Squid
3 tb Olive oil
Salt
--------------------------PICKLING SPICES & HERBS--------------------------
1    Bay leaf
1    Sprig fresh rosemary
8    Black peppercorns
2    Garlic cloves
Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and small
sand bag and ink. Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them inside and out
with cold water. Heads and tentacles should be rinsed thoroughly. Cut the
sacs into 1/2-inch wide rounds. Heat the oil in a frying pan and slip in
the squid rounds, heads and tentacles. Cover and simmer until bright pink
and tender (approximately 30 minutes), adding salt and pepper to taste,
parsley and rosemary during the last 15 minutes. Half fill a clean
quart-sized jar with the squid and all the juices remaining in the pan. Add
white vinegar almost to the top, then the pickling spices and herbs. Seal
the jar tightly and shake. Marinate at least one day before serving. Keep
in the refrigerator.

To serve, remove from marinade and serve cold, within 10 days.
