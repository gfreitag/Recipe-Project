This recipe is our favorite "make ahead" soup.  The Bean Soup Mix makes a
big batch and once made you can put this soup together quickly.  Use your
food processor for the veggies for even greater speed.  The Bean Soup Mix
is also a fun personalized holiday gift when accompanied with a copy of the
recipe.

Wash bean soup mix and place in a large dutch oven.  Add broth and water.
Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add chopped
tomato & next 12 ingredients; simmer for an additional hour or until peas
are tender.  Discard bay leaves.  Ladle soup into bowls, and sprinkle with
cheese.

Makes 2 1/2 quarts.

BEAN SOUP MIX:  Sort peas.  Combine peas, lentils and barley in a large
bowl, stir.  Store in an airtight container.  (Makes 10 cups!!)

NOTE:  Freeze extra soup in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw
overnight in refrigerator.  To serve, place in a large saucepan, and cook
over medium heat until thoroughly heated, stirring soup occasionally.
