Title: Gruibensalat (Crackling Salad)
Categories: Salads, Vegetables, German
Yield: 4 servings
100 g  Cracklings (3 1/2 oz)
1/2 tb Pepper
1 tb (level) salt
A few Tbsp meat broth or
-water
1 kg Potatoes, boiled in their
-jackets and peeled (a
Generous 2 lbs)
1 lg Onion, sliced
125 g  Lard (1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp)
This is an old-style recipe from grandma's more thrifty age, and is rarely
found today.

Slice the potatoes while still hot, and mix in the sliced onion.  Add the
liquid and seasoning.  Meanwhile, heat the cracklings in the lard, and when
very hot, pour over the potato salad, and lightly stir in.

In olden times, this was eaten with a slice of rye bread. Today, one could
serve it with something like an endive (escarole) salad.

Serves 4.
