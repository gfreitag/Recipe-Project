Title: Grundstock Nudelteig (Basic Pasta Dough)
Categories: Pasta, German
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 l  Water (1/2 cup plus 1/2
-Tbsp)
400 g  Flour (3 1/2 cups)
2    Eggs
Mix flour, eggs (only if pasta is supposed to be more on the firm side),
and water, and knead into a firm dough.  Continue kneading until dough
pulls free off hands and pasta board.  Cut into 2 or 3 loaves, and again
knead until smooth.  Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes, then - on a floured
pastry board - roll out. Cut noodles with a knife, or roll with with the
palm of your hand.

Serves 4.

[Note:  For 'Schupfnudle' - noodles rolled by hand - do not use any egg,
else the noodles get too firm.  Also, the cooked, drained and rinsed
'Schupfnudle' are swished around in butter foam or lard before serving with
stewed fruit or salad.  K.B.]
