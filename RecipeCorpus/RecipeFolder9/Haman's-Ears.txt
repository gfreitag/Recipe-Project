Orecchi di Aman For the Italian Jews orecchi di Aman are as synonymous with
the festival of Purim as the Hamantaschen are for the Ashkenazim.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks with the sugar, lemon rind, olive
oil, vanilla extract and rum. Gradually add enough flour to make a rahter
soft dough. Turn out onto a floured working surface and knead for 2 or 3
minutes. Roll very thin. With a pastry cutter or sharp knife, cut into
strips 1 inch x 4 to 7 inches. Slowly heat the oil in a small saucepan.
(Oil is at the right temperature when a small piece of dough drops into it
floats and begins to sizzle.) Fry a few strips at a time, twirling them to
give them odd shapes until they are lightly golden. (Tie the longer pieces
into a knot before frying them.) Drain and place on a paper towe. When all
the ears are done, transfer to a large serving dish, sprinkling each layer
with confectioner's sugar (through a sieve). YIELDS: 2 to 3 dozen
