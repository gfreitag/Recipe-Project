Title: Glitscher
Categories: Vegetables, German
Yield: 4 servings
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Water
Salt
3 md Raw potatoes
1 3/4 lb Potatoes, boiled in their
-jackets a day ahead
3 tb To 4 tb (heaping) flour
So called for their well-known propensity to slip ('glitschen') off one's
plate, 'Glitscher' are also called 'Wetzsteine' (whetstones) because they
are more or less the same shape (although shorter) as the old-fashioned
sharpening stones used for a sickle or scythe blade.

Grate the raw potatoes into a bowl full of water, then place in a coarse
muslin bag or wrap in a rolled-up dishtowel, and wring out thoroughly.  The
boiled potatoes should be cooked a day in advance, then peeled and grated
on the following day.  Combine the two, along with the flour, eggs, and
water, and mix thoroughly; season with salt.  Shape the dumplings with wet
hands.  The dumplings should be fairly long and pointed at both ends.  Cook
in simmering salted water for about 20 minutes.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
