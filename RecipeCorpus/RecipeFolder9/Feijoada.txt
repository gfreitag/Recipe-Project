Yield: 6 servings
1/2 lb Chuck beef
1/2 lb Salt pork
Salt & freshly ground black
-pepper
2 lg Cloves garlic, chopped
2 ts Shortening
3 c  Dried black beans
Water
1 lb Carne seca (sun-cured salted

2 lb Raw smoked tongue
1/2 lb Linguica defumada
-(Portuguese sausage)
Wash the beans well & soak them overnight in water to cover. Soak the dried
beef separately in water to cover. Drain the beans.

Add 6 cups water & cook, covered, adding water as needed, until the beans
are tender, or about 2 1/2 hours.  As soon as the beans are cooking, begin
adding the other ingredients.

Cut the carne seca into 1 1/2" squares & add to the beans. Peel the tongue
& cut it into large cubes. Cover with water & bring to a boil. Simmer 2
minutes, drain, & add to beans.

Prick the sausages with a fork, cover with water, boil a few minutes,
drain, & add to the beans. Cut the chuck in half & add to the beans. Cut
the salt pork into 1/2" slices & add to the beans. Season the stew with
salt & pepper.

When the beans are tender, brown the garlic lightly in the shortening. Add
about 1 cup of the beans, mash, & return to the large pot of beans. Adjust
the seasonings.

Remove the pieces of meat to a hot platter & turn the beans into a chafing
dish or bowl.

Serve with braised pork loin, collards, onions in sauce (recipes below),
sweetened orange slices, & hot rice.  Cook the rice according to package
directions, adding 1 1/2 Tbsp. shortening & 1/2 tsp. vinegar for each 2
cups uncooked, long-grain rice.
