Title: Batter Fried Sage Leaves (Salbey Zu Backen)
Categories: German
Yield: 8 servings
1    Egg white
1 tb Melted butter that has been
-allowed to cool
1 pn Salt
1 pn (small) sugar
1 c  (scant) flour
3 tb Cold water
1    Egg, beaten
A few tablespoons white wine
-(or hard cider)
This recipe is taken almost verbatim from a cookbook originally published
in 1709; the language has been slightly modernized, but only 2 ingredients
have been added (sugar and salt).

plenty of nice fresh sage leaves oil or shortening for deep frying

Take the flour and mix with the cold water into a thick batter that must be
smooth.  Then mix in the beaten egg and stir well; pour in a little sour
wine, yet not too much.  Beat the egg white into soft peaks and fold into
the batter.  Finally, add the butter as well as a very little salt and
sugar and stir the batter once more.  Wash and dry off the sage leaves,
dredge them in the batter, and fry them on both sides in hot lard (see
Note) until crispy.

Note:  I [=Horst Scharfenberg] would suggest that you fold in the egg white
last of all and let the batter sit for about 30 minutes beforehand. Also,
vegetable oil or shortening is recommended for deep frying rather than
lard.

Makes 8 servings.
