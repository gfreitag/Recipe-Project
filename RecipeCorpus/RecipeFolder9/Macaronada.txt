Karen Mintzias
500 g  Macaroni or spaghetti
4 l  Water
2 tb Salt
1 tb Oil
TO COOK PASTA:  Bring water to the boil with salt and oil.  Keep water
boiling briskly and put in a handful of pasta at a time.  Push into the
water slowly as the strands soften and curl around the sides of the pan.
Stir well as each lot is added, then boil briskly, stirring occasionally.
Cook until just tender - test by biting a piece.  Drain well in a colander
and return to pan in which it was cooked.

TO PREPARE FOR SERVING:  Melt butter and heat to a deep golden brown -- do
not burn.  Pour over pasta, add grated cheese and toss well to coat
strands.

Serve extra grated cheese in a bowl.
