Title: Provencal Potatoes with Tomatoes
Categories: Vegetables, French
Yield: 2 servings
- cut into thin slices
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 ts Parmesan cheese
1/2 ts Chopped flat-leaf parsley
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Tomato paste
1 lg All-purpose potato; scrubbed
- and cut into slices
- 1/16-in thick
1    Plum tomato
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 400F. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and
tomato paste. Add the potato slices, tossing to cover evenly. In an 8-inch
ovenproof skillet, layer the potatoes around the outside and in the center.
Slide the tomato slices evenly between the sliced potato. Season lightly
with salt and pepper, and heat the pan on top of the stove at medium-high
heat until crackling noises are heard, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer the
pan to the oven to bake until the slices are slightly crisp and the potato
is tender when pierced with a knife, about 25 minutes. Remove, sprinkle on
the Parmesan cheese and run the dish under the broiler just until the
cheese is lightly colored, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, watching carefully. Remove
and sprinkle on the parsley, and serve.
