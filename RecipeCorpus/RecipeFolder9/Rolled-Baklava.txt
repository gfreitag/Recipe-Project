2 lb Phyllo pastry sheets
1 1/2 lb Sweet butter; melted
4 lb Walnut meats; finely chopped
-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
1/2    Lemon (juice only)
1 sm Jar of honey
4 c  Granulated sugar
2 c  Water
Take 4 sheets of phyllo pastry, keeping remaining sheets covered with a
damp towel.  Brush each sheet with melted butter and lay one on top of the
other.  Mix walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves.  Sprinkle some of the
mixture evenly over the top buttered sheet and set the pieces upright in a
large buttered pan.  Continue, using another 4 buttered sheets of phyllo,
sprinkling with nut mixture, rolling and cutting, until the pan or pans are
full and all the nut mixture is used.  Spoon about 1 teaspoon melted butter
over each piece, and continue baking for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden
brown.  Remove from oven and dip each piece into cold thick syrup. Drain on
cake racks.

Syrup:  In a saucepan, combine granulated sugar, water, lemon juice and
small jar of honey.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes, removing
scum as it rises to the surface.
