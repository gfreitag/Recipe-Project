1 tb Flour
2 ts Grated onion
1/2 ts Baking powder
4    Very large potatoes
1    Egg
1 tb Salt
1 ds Pepper
Peel and grate potatoes. Drain off half the liquid. Add: egg, salt,
pepper, flour, grated onion and baking powder. Mix very well. Drop by
teaspoon into very hot oil (475 deg,) in skillet. Brown well on both sides.
May be frozen by placing pancakes between layers of aluminum foil. When
ready to serve, reheat uncovered, in 450 deg. oven until crispy. Serve with
apple sauce.
This method will give you 100 2" diameter pancakes.If you use a much
larger spoon, cup, etc, you will of course get larger pancakes, less
cooking and still the same delicious taste....
