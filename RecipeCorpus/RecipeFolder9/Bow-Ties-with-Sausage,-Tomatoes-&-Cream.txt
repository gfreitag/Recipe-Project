Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and pepper
flakes. Cook until sausage is no longer pink, stirring frequently, about 7
minutes. Add onion and garlic to skillet and cook until onion is tender and
sausage is light brown, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Add
tomatoes, cream and salt. Simmer until mixture thickens slightly, about 4
minutes.
