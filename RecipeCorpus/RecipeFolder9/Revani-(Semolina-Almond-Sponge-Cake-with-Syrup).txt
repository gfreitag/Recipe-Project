Title: Revani (Semolina-Almond Sponge Cake with Syrup)
Categories: Greek, Cakes
Yield: 20 servings
6    Eggs; room temperature
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Fine semolina
3 ts Baking powder
1 c  Finely chopped almonds *
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Brandy
Karen Mintzias
2 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
3 c  Cold water
1 sm Cinnamon stick
3    Whole cloves
1    Orange (peel only)
1/2 lb Sweet butter
*Note: Use blanched, peeled almonds.

Combine 1-1/2 cups of the sugar with the cold water in a saucepan and cook
until dissolved, then add the cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange peel and
simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove the flavorings.  Cool.

Using an electric mixer, beat the butter in a large bowl until fluffy.
Gradually add the remaining sugar, beating on medium speed, then add the
eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition, without
rushing.  Meanwhile, sift the flour, semolina, baking powder, and almonds
together.  Very gradually add to the batter, beating on medium speed, then
pour in the vanilla and brandy and give the batter a last whirl on high
speed for a few seconds.  Pour immediately into a buttered 9 x 12 x 3-inch
cake pan and bake on the center rack of a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to
35 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched by a finger. Remove
from the oven and set the pan on a cake rack.  Using a sharp knife, score
the cake into diamond shapes.  Spoon the cooled syrup over the entire cake
and cool.

Note: Each piece may be attractively garnished with a candied or marachino
cherry slice in the center and almond slivers angled on each side.
