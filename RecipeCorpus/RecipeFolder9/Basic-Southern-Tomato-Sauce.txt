Title: Basic Southern Tomato Sauce
Categories: Sauces, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Chopped parsley
Salt
35 oz Drained canned plum tomatoes
1    Garlic clove
3 tb Olive oil
This is a typical southern Italian sauce. If you like it spicier, add
peperoncino (red pepper flakes).

COARSELY CHOP THE TOMATOES on a plate, saving the liquid they release.
Halve the garlic clove. Heat the olive oil in a broad saute pan and simmer
the garlic in it until lightly golden, then press the pieces against the
pan and remove them. Raise heat to medium-high and add the chopped tomatoes
and their juices from the plate. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10
minutes, until the sauce is lightly thickened. Add the chopped parsley and
1/4 teaspoon salt, stir all together once, then remove the sauce from the
heat.

Makes 2 1/2 Cups
