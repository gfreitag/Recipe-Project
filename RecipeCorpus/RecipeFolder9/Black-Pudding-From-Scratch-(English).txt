Title: Black Pudding From Scratch (English)
Categories: Pork/ham, Londontowne
Yield: 6 servings
8 oz Fine oatmeal
1 ts Salt
2 ts Ground black pepper
2 ts Dried and crumbled mint
1 1/4 qt Fresh pig's blood
8 7/8 oz Bread cut into cubes
1 1/4 qt Skim milk
1 lb Cooked barley
1 lb Fresh beef suet
Put the bread cubes to soak in the milk in a warm oven.  Do not heat the
milk beyond blood temperature!  Have the blood ready in a large bowl, and
pour the warm milk and bread into it.  Stir in the cooked barley. Grate the
beef suet into the mixture and stir it up with the oatmeal. Season with the
salt, pepper and mint.

Have ready 2 or three large roasting pans.  Divide the mixture between them
~- they should not be more than 3/4 full.  Bake in a moderate oven -- 350 F
~- for about an hour or until the pudding is well cooked through. This
makes a beautifully light pudding which will keep well in a cold larder.

Cut into squared and fry till heated through and the outside is crisp, in
bacon fat or butter.  Delicious for breakfast, or for supper with fried
apples and mashed potato.
