Categories: Ethnic, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Blanched, slivered almonds
1/2 ts Ground cardamom (or more)
1 ts Rose water (or more)
Add'l pistachios or almonds
1 c  Sugar
2 c  Water
3/4 c  Ghee
1 c  Coarse semolina (farina)
1/4 c  Blanched pistachio nuts
Cooking time: 30-35 minutes

Combine sugar and water in a pan and stir occasionally until dissolved over
medium heat.  Bring to the boil, and boil briskly for 5 minutes without
stirring.  Remove from heat and leave aside in pan.

In a heavy deep pan heat ghee and add semolina.  Stir over medium heat for
5 minutes.  Semolina should not colour.  Pour hot syrup over semolina,
stirring constantly.  When smoothly blended, reduce heat a little and leave
to cook, uncovered, until liquid is absorbed.  Mixture should be thick, but
still moist at this stage.  Stir in nuts, and cardamom and rose water to
taste.

Cover rim of pan with a cloth or 2 paper towels, put lid on tightly and
leave on low heat for 5 minutes.  Turn of heat and leave pan undisturbed
for 10 minutes.

Spread halwau on a flat, lightly oiled platter and decorate with nuts.
Serve warm or cold, cutting pieces into diamond shapes or squares.
