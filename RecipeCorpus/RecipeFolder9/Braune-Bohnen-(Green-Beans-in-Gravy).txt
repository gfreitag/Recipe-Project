From grandmother's more thrifty times; rarely encountered today.

In a wide saucepan, melt the fat, and then slowly stir in the flour, until
you have a dark brown roux.  Add enough water or meat broth to obtain a
thick gravy.  Add salt, the onion with the two cloves, the bay leaf, and
sugar, and slowly simmer for about 20 minutes.  Meanwhile cook the green
beans in salted water until al dente.  Drain water.  Stir green beans into
gravy and let steep for a few minutes before serving.

'Dampfnudeln' (yeast dumplings) are often served with this dish.

Serves 4.
