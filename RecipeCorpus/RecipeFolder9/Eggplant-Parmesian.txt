You are going to cut, bread and fry the eggplant first.

Peel the dark skin off the eggplant. Slice into medium slices slices (about
1/2 in thick) on the smaller side. Pour Flavored Bread crumbs into a plate
or into a dish for coating the eggplant patties. . Beat 3 eggs for dipping
into eggplant. Heat up oil in a large pan, enough to fry the eggplant. Dip
eggplant into egg and coat it with egg thoroughly. Then coat it with bread
crumbs. Put them on to a plate when finished till you have enough to fry in
your frying pan. Place the eggplant in the frying pan if you think it is
hot enough to fry properly. Keep it frying till both sides are brown. Make
sure you flip eggplant over so all sides will brown. When finished frying a
batch place fried patties onto a plate covered with a paper towel to absorb
the oil. Pre heat the oven to 350~.

After all the frying is done. Coat a pan with some oil (about a 9in square
by 1 1/2 in deep disposable aluminum pan). Pour a little bit tomato sauce
on the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of the eggplant patties on top.
Cover that with sauce and a little bit of mozzerella cheese. Place another
layer on top of that, repeat. When done put sauce and a lot of cheese at
the very top add parmesian cheese to the top if desired or available.

Cover the top of pan with foil. Place in the oven for 45 minutes. Stick
fork in middle to see if it is hot all the way through. If not hot enough
cook another 10 minutes. Leave it cooking with the foil off the top for the
last 10 minutes of the cooking.

Let it settle before serving for about 5 minutes. This taste good or better
reheated. Can be reheated in Microwaveable dish.
