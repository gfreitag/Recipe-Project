The Berberes are a nomadic tribe in northern Africa.  Fenugreek is a
rectangle-shaped seed with a pleasantly bitter flavor.  Look for it in
Indian and Middle Eastern grocery stores.  I have used this marinade with
great success on tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin steak.

* Juice of 1 lemon (1/4 cup)

Finely chop onion.  Mince garlic and ginger.  Place onions, garlic, ginger,
peppercorns, red pepper, coriander, cardamom, fenugreek, cinnamon, cloves,
allspice, salt and paprika in dry skillet and cook over medium heat 3 to 4
minutes, or until spices are lightly roasted and fragrant. Combine roasted
spice mixture, olive oil and lemon juice in blender and puree to smooth
paste.  Spread paste on meat and marinate overnight. WARNING: A little of
this spicy mixture goes a long way!

Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 pounds tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin
steak.
