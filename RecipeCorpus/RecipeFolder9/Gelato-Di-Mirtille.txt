Title: Gelato Di Mirtille
Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 8 servings
1    Lemon peel strip (2-in)
2 c  Fresh blueberries; pureed
1 c  Heavy cream
2/3 c  Sugar
4    Egg yolks
1 c  Milk; at room temperature
1 pn Salt
BEAT SUGAR AND EGG YOLKS together until pale yellow and very thick. Slowly
add milk, beating gently to avoid a build-up of foam. Add lemon peel and
stir in salt. Transfer mixture to the top of a double boiler with an inch
of boiling water in the bottom half. Regulate heat so water remains at a
low boil, and stir continuously 8 minutes. Custard will thicken to coat the
spoon, and surface foam will disappear. Immediately remove top of double
boiler and set it in a large bowl of cold water. Stir 2 minutes to cool
custard somewhat. Then transfer it to a bowl, cover, and chill thoroughly.
Also chill pureed blueberries and heavy cream. When ready to proceed, whip
cream into soft peaks. Remove lemon peel from custard and fold in
blueberries and whipped cream. Transfer mixture to ice cream machine and
freeze according to machine's directions.
