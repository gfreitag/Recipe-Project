This recipe is approximate.  One of the controlling factors is the amount
of leftover mashed potatoes you have----- Besides, Dad never did write this
one down!

KALUSKI:

Blend flour and salt.

Make a well with the flour.  Mix in the eggs, thoroughly, one at a time.
Add the mashed potatoes.

You should have a dough that is not quite as stiff as a noodle dough. Add a
little water, if necessary, to thin it out.

Roll the dough into long strands, about 1 inch in diameter.  Cut into
sections about 1 1/2 inches long.

Gently add to a large pot of boiling water.  Do not add too many, nor add
them too fast.  You want to keep the water boiling.  They are down when
they start to float.  Remove the floaters to a bowl, and continue till you
finish off the dough pieces.

ONION SAUCE:

Melt butter in pan.  Add coarsely sliced/diced onion.  Saute to taste. I
like them just transparent, Dad liked them browned, almost burnt. Salt and
pepper, to taste.

SERVE:

You've got a few options, here---

A:  Pour Onion Sauce over the whole batch
B:  Serve each separately, for the whiners
who don't like onions.  Plain butter
works out, just fine.
C:  As a side dish, they are great with
meat gravy

LEFTOVERS:

Should you be fortunate to have some left over, just place in the
refrigerator.  They are ok, cold, but just reheat in a frying pan. They
heat more evenly if you slice the kaluski into somewhat smaller pieces.
