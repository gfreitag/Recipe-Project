32 oz Jar Prego Green Label

Grated Parmesan cheese

Mix Prego with water, (I rinse the jar out with the water.) Blend together
the ricotta and egg, adding a generous amount of pepper. Layer ingredients
in 9 x 12 pyrex pan as follows, starting from the bottom:

1/3 sauce 1/2 the noodles 1/2 the ricotta mixture 1/2 Mozzarella 1/3 sauce

Cover tightly with a double layer Saran Wrap.  Microwave on HI for 8
minutes, then mdm low for 32, turning the pan occasionally. Loosen cover,
sprinkle top with grated Parmesan (store bought will work, but of course
fresh is best) Cover loosely and let stand 15 minutes.
