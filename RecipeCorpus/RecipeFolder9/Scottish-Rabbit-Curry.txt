Title: Scottish Rabbit Curry
Categories: Ethnic, Meats, Hot
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Mushroom-powder
Celery (optional)
Coco-nut (optional)
Salt and cayenne to taste
1 pt Well seasoned stock
1    Fresh Rabbit
6 oz Streaky Bacon
6    Button onions
4 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
1 tb Curry-powder
Choose a fat, fresh rabbit.  (To test it, examine the kidney.)  Cut it into
at least twelve pieces; brown these in butter, with onions.  When browned,
if you wish delicate cookery, pour off the butter and add three-quarters of
a pint of well-seasoned stock, one large spoonful of curry-powder and one
of flour, six ounces of streaky bacon cut into half inch cubes, and also
half a dozen button onions.  Season with a teaspoonful of mushroom powder.
Simmer this slowly for half an hour at least, stirring it.  Add what more
seasonings you think required, as cayenne, a little turmeric, or some acid.
Pile up the pieces of rabbit and pour the sauce, which should be thickish
as in all curry dishes, over them.  Serve with plain boiled rice in a
separate dish.

Fresh coco-nut is an excellent ingredient in mild curries.  Rasp and stew
it the whole time; we do not like green vegetables in curries though they
are sometimes used.  Mushrooms are an enrichment, celery is good, and onion
is indispensable.
