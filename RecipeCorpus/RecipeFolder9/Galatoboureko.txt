1    Piece of cinnamon bark
2 ts Lemon juice
1 c  Sugar

Cooking time: 1 hour Oven temperature: 180øC (350øF)

Mix milk, sugar, semolina, butter, lemon rind, cinnamon bark and salt in a
heavy-based saucepan and heat until thickened, stirring constantly.  Let
custard bubble gently over low heat for 5 minutes.

Take from heat and remove cinnamon.  Cover with a piece of buttered paper
to prevent skin forming.  When cool, blend in eggs and vanilla.

Butter a 33 x 23 cm (13 x 9 inch) oven dish.  Place half of the filo pastry
sheets in the dish, brushing each sheet with the melted butter.

Pour in custard and top with remaining sheets, again brushing each with
butter as it is placed in postition.  Brush top with remaining butter and
score through top sheets of filo in 8 cm (3 inch) squares or diamonds.
Sprinkle top lightly with water.

Trim edges and bake in a moderate oven for 45 minutes until pastry is
golden brown and custard is set when tested with a knife.  Remove from oven
and cool thoroughly in the dish.

Dissolve sugar in water over low heat, increase heat to medium and bring to
the boil.  Add cinnamon bark and lemon juice and boil for 10 minutes.

Cool syrup to lukewarm before straining and pouring over the cool pie.
Leave until cold before serving.
