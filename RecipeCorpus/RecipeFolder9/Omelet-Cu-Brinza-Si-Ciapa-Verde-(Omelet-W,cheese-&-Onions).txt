Title: Omelet Cu Brinza Si Ciapa Verde (Omelet W/cheese & Onions)
Categories: Russian, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
1/3 c  Milk
Salt And Freshly Ground
-Black Pepper
2 tb Unsalted (Sweet) Butter
2 tb Fresh Dill; For Garnish
6 oz Feta; Preferably Bulgarian
1/2 c  Scallions (Green Onions);
-Finely Chopped
1 1/2 ts Sweet Hungarian Paprika;
-Plus More For Garnish
6 lg Eggs
If the feta is too salty, soak in cold water for 30 minutes.  Drain well
and crumble into fine pieces.  Combine, in a bowl, with the scallions and
paprika, then set aside.  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, salt and
pepper, together, until frothy.  Melt the butter in a 10-inch omelet pan
over medium heat.  When the butter bubbles rapidly, add half of the egg
mixture and stir until it just begins to set.  Continue cooking until the
eggs are almost completely cooked, running a thin spatula around the edges
to prevent sticking, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Sprinkle half of the feta
mixture on the omelet, then reduce the heat to very low, cover, and cook
for 1 minute more.  Slide the omelet onto a plate, folding it over if
desired.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients making 1 more omelet. Serve
at once, sprinkled with more paprika and the fresh dill.
