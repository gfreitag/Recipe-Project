*DIRECTIONS*

Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water.  Mix sugar, margarine, milk, beaten egg,
salt, nutmeg, cloves, and mace.  Add 3 cups of the flour and beat until
smooth. Gradually add enough flour to make soft dough (note that 6 to 7
cups of flour can be used).  Turn out onto floured surface and knead till
smooth and elastic.  Place in greased bowl, cover and let rise till dough
doubles in bulk.  Punch down.  Divide dough in half. Form 12 round buns and
place on greased baking sheet. Repeat with other half of dough. Cut a deep
cross on each bun with sharp knife. Brush with beaten egg. Sprinkle with
caraway seeds. Cover and let rise till doubled. Bake at 375 degrees for 20
minutes. Note: Serve these caraway-topped buns with hot spiced cider on
Christmas Eve, or with raspberry jam as a Christmas-morning breakfast
treat.
