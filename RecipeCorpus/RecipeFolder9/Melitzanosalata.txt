Karen Mintzias
2    Eggplants (1 - 1-1/2 lbs ea)
4    Garlic cloves
2    Tomatoes; peeled and chopped
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Bake eggplants for 45 minutes in a 375 degree oven or in hot ashes.  Peel
off and discard the skin, then chop the eggplant flesh while still hot. Rub
a wood or earthenware bowl with one of the garlic cloves, cut.  Add the
eggplant and beat with a wooden spoon-- or if available use a wood mortar
to pound the eggplants.  Continue pounding or beating, meanwhile adding the
tomatoes, a little salt and pepper, 2 to 3 cloves garlic, crushed, and the
herbs.  Continuing to beat, gradually add the olive oil alternately with
the red wine vinegar.  Taste, adding oil and vinegar if necessary;
melitzanosalata should be thick and smooth.  Serve cold with fish, meat, or
fresh crisp bread.
