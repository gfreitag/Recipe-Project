Title: Ham with Noodles (Schinkennudeln)
Categories: Pasta, Pork/ham, German
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Grated Swiss cheese
-(Emmentaler)
1 tb To 2 tb butter
2 tb Bread crumbs
3/4 lb Fresh egg noodles
1/2 lb Ham, diced
Salt
1 c  Sour cream
This is one of the most popular German casseroles, especially south of the
Main Line.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cook the noodles in salted water and drain; they can also be left over from
the day before.  Fill a souffle pan with alternate layers of ham and
noodles; salt lightly and put some of the sour cream and some grated cheese
over each layer.  The top layer should consist of noodles.  Dot with little
bits of butter and sprinkle with bread crumbs.

Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes.

Variations:

This version of the recipe comes from Swabia; feel free to increase the
proportions of the costlier ingredients (ham, butter, sour cream) as your
fancy dictates.

In another version of this casserole, the ingredients are all mixed
together in one bowl, along with 3 eggs, the souffle pan is well greased
with butter (always recommended), and the contents of the bowl transferred
to the pan, the proceed as described above.

Makes 4 servings.
