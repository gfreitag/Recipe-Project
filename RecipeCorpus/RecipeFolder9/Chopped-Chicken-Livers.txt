and any discolored spots. If you find one with a green area, which is the
gall, throw it away. It would make everything taste bitter.  Arrange the

While livers are baking, saute the onions in the schmaltz (chicken fat)
until very brown. Peel the eggs and chop them coarsley. Place in a bowl of
food processor,or blender.Add the livers,the sauteed onions,salt and
pepper.Pulse the machine until everything is ground and mixed together. 

For real down home chopped liver,the whole process should be done in a
wooden bowl, with single bladed chopping knife.
