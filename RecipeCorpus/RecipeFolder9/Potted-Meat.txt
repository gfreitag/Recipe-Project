Chop and pound to a paste any fragments of cooked ham, tongue, poultry,
game or fish. With ham use a quarter part of fat. Remove all gristle and
skin and pound until free from any fibre and reduced to a paste. Season
highly with salt, pepper, cayenne, and made mustard, and moisten with a
little melted butter (except ham, which has fat enough). Pack closely in
small stone or earthen jars. Put jars in steamer and heat for one half
hour. Then press the meat down again and cover with hot melted butter. This
will keep some time and may be served in slices or used for sandwiches. Ham
and tongue may be mixed with veal or chicken. Beef, game and fish are
better alone. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes,
