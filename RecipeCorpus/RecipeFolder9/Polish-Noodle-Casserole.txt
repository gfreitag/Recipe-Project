Categories: Pasta, Casseroles, Polish
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Salt,
1/2 ts Powdered mustard, and
1/4 ts White ground pepper.
1/2 lb Cooked and drained noodles,
2/3 c  Sour cream,
2/3 c  Cottage cheese,
2 tb Minced onion,
INSTRUCTIONS Place: Cooked and drained noodles in a buttered 1 quart
casserole dish. Mix: Sour cream, cottage cheese, minced onion, salt,
powdered mustard, and white ground pepper. Mix the above with the noodles
in the casserole dish.  Bake  in a preheated 350 F. oven for 25 minutes.
(The noodles on  top should begin to brown.)

To  be a bit more fancy, when the 25 minutes is over, pull  the casserole
out of the oven, smear it with a bit of butter,  and allow it to cook
another 5 to 10 minutes.

To be even more fancy, sprinkle some paremesan cheese on top of the butter
before putting the casserrole back into the oven.
