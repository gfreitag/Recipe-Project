Title: Pan Di Spagna - Basic Genoise (Sponge Cake)
Categories: Italian, Cakes
Yield: 2 servings
1 ts Vanilla
6 1/2 oz Cake flour
1/4 ts Cornstarch
5    Eggs
2    Egg yolks
6 1/2 oz Sugar
Salt; a pinch

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 1. Blend the eggs, egg yolks, and sugar in a
mixer bowl with a wire whip attachment until the mixture doubles in
volume-about 15 minutes on high speed. Just before stopping the mixer, add
the vanilla and mix in. 2. Sift together the cake flour, cornstarch and
salt.  fold dry mixture into egg mixture with a wooden spoon or rubber
spatula, just until blended. 3. Coat two 10-inch round cake pans with
shortening.  Pour the batter into the pans and put them immediately into a
preheated 350 degree oven. Bake until tops are springy to the touch, about
45-50 minutes. 4. Remove the cakes from the pans and cool on a wire rack.
When cool, use a long serrated knife to slice off the tops of the cakes.
For tirami su or other layer cakes, divide each cake into three uniform
layers with a serrated knive. Makes two cakes. Suggested wine: Passito del
Santo Chef Andrea says in his book, "We bake all our own cakes an Andrea's,
and this is the one we probably bake most often.  It is the basis for our
own tirami su, our strawberry cake, and a few others." From La Cucina di
Andrea's cookbook by Andrea Apuzzo.  89-63780 Published by dell'ART, Inc.
