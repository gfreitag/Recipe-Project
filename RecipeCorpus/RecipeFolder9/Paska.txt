mixture with the cheese.  Add 2 cups heavy cream and mix well.  Add 1/4
pound each of chopped, blanched almonds and mixed candied fruits and
raisins.  Flavor with the seeds scraped from 2 vanilla beans and mix until
the fruits are evenly distributed.  Line a pyramidal paskha form with a
fine cheesecloth wrung out of cold water.  Pour the mixture into the form
and fold the cheesecloth to cover the bottom of the cake.  Weight the
cheese down well and allow it to drip for 24 hours.  A deep flowerpot with
a hole in the bottom for drainage makes a satisfactory paskha mold. Unmold
the paskha and decorate it as you wish.  Paskha is traditionally servied
with kulich, the Russian Easter bread.
