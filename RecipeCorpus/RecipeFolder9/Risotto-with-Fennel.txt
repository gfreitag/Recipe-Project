Title: Risotto with Fennel
Categories: Italian
Yield: 4 servings
- preferably freshly grated
5 c  Light chicken stock; -=OR=-
2 1/2 c  - Canned broth with
2 1/2 c  - Water
6 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Chopped sweet yellow onion
1    Fennel bulb (1 lb); trimmed
- quartered, cored
- and cut into 1/4-in slices    1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
1/4 ts Salt
1 pn Nutmeg
IN A LARGE HEAVY SAUCEPAN OR flame-proof casserole, melt 3 tablespoons of
the butter over low heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, but not
browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in the sliced fennel. Season with the salt
and nutmeg; mix well. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10
minutes. Meanwhile, bring the stock to a simmer in another saucepan. After
10 minutes, add the rice to the fennel, stirring to coat each grain with
butter. Add 2 cups of the hot stock. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered,
stirring constantly, until the rice is just tender, adding more stock, 1/2
cup at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid, about 20 minutes. (If you run
out of stock before the rice is done, use hot water.) The finished dish
should be moist but not soupy. When the rice is tender but still firm,
remove from the heat and stir in the pepper, the remaining 3 tablespoons
butter and the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with additional salt to taste
and serve immediately in warm bowls.
