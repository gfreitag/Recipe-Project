-------------------------SPICED TIED IN CHEESECLOTH-------------------------
4    Bay leaves
1 sm Sprig rosemary
12    Black peppercorns
2    Sprigs thyme
PLACE THE BEANS IN COLD WATER and soak overnight. The next day, place a
heavy pot on the stove over medium heat and cook the duck pieces on both
sides to render some of the fat. This takes about 15 minutes total. Remove
the duck and set aside. Increase heat to high and add the pork. Brown well,
remove from the pot and set aside. Brown the lamb. Remove and set aside.
Preheat oven to 300F. Pour off and discard most of the fat, leaving just
about 3 tablespoons in the pot. Lower heat to medium and add the onions.
Cook, stirring, until onions soften, about 7 minutes. Add drained beans,
bacon, garlic and herbs and replace the duck, pork and lamb. Add 4 cups
water, cover and place in the oven for 2 hours. Add the sausages and salt
as desired. Replace in the oven another hour. Remove herbs in cheesecloth.
When it's time to serve dinner, place the casserole on the table.
