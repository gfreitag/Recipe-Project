Title: French Apple Tart
Categories: Desserts, French, Pies
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Apricot jam
1/4 c  Calvados
-=OR=- Dark Rum or Cognac
2 tb Butter
1    (9-in) pre-cooked tart shell
2 lb Apples
-preferably Golden Delicious
1/2    Lemon, juiced
2 tb Sugar (or more if needed)
PEEL, QUARTER and core the apples. Slice 3 apples into thin slices, toss
with lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the sugar and set aside. Make
applesauce with the rest of the apples: Chop coarsely, place in a saucepan
with 2-3 tablespoons of water, cover and cook over a medium-low heat until
very soft. Warm the jam, then force it through a sieve (fruit bits can be
returned to the jar). Add 1/4 cup of strained jam to applesauce, together
with the Calvados and butter. Continue cooking, if needed, until fairly
thick. Taste and add sugar if needed. It should taste sweet, but not like
jam. Spread the applesauce over the tart shell, then layer the drained
apple slices in concentric circles over it. Bake about 30 minutes, until
the apples are tender. Warm remaining apricot jam, adding a tablespoon or
so of water if needed, to paint over the tart. Best served warm.
