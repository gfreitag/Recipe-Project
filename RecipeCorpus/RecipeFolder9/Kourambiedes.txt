Karen Mintzias
1 c  Sweet butter
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1    Egg yolk
2 tb Brandy or Cognac, (optional)
1 ts Almond extract
In electric mixing bowl, whip the sweet butter until it is fluffy and
white.  Continuing to beat on medium speed, gradually add the 1/2 cup
powdered sugar, egg yolk, and flavorings.
Meanwhile, sift the baking powder with the flour and gradually add to
the batter, mixing by hand and working the flour thoroughly into the
mixture before adding more.  Mix in ground almonds.  Knead until a soft,
buttery dough is formed that will stay together when a little is rolled in
the palms of your hands.  Break off pieces slightly larger than a walnut,
then roll into balls, half-moons, or S-curves.  Place on cookie sheets
allowing an inch between each.  Bake on the center rack of a 350-degree
oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden colored, not chestnut.  Remove
from the oven and carefully lift each Kourambie and place on a generous
layer of sifted powdered sugar.  Immediately sift more powdered sugar over
to cover Kourambiedes.  Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before lifting
and rolling to be sure they are evenly coated.  May be served in individual
fluted paper cups.
