Fish must be absolutely fresh. Clean the fish well making sure the gills
are removed from the head.  Separate the head from the body and remove all
bones from fish.  Save head and bones. Place  onion, carrot, celery, one
slice lemon and the peppercorns into a fish poacher.  Add the fish filets,
the head and the bones.  Add cold water to cover and 1/2 tsp salt. Simmer,
covered, for 10 - 20 minutes or until done. The fish is done when the eye
pops out a little and the meat flakes.  Remove from heat. Carefully pick
out any pieces of meat avoiding bones and vegetables and arrange inside a
fish mold or on an oval serving plate. Lightly season with salt, white
pepper and lemon juice. Strain the broth and return to the stove. Let it
boil uncovered until the liquid is reduced to about a cup, then pour it
over the fish and refrigerate until the gelatin is firm. To serve, unmold
and cut in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Then cut each half into four
or five pieces diagonally forming a fishbone pattern. Mask the cuts under a
swirl of mayonnaise so the effect looks like a whole fish. Cut the lemon
slices and arrange around the fish to look like fins.
