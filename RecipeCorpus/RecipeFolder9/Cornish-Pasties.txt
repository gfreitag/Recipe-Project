Title: Cornish Pasties
Categories: Londontowne
Yield: 6 servings
FILLING:
8    Ox cubed beef stew meat
2 md Potatoes peeled & diced
1 lg Finely chopped onion
4 c  Flour
1 pn Salt
1 c  Lard
1 c  Cold water approximately
Pastry:

Salt and pepper to taste Approximately 2 teaspoon cornstarch

PASTRY:

Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and cut in lard until mixture
resembles fine bread crumbs. Add water slowly, a little at a time, until
mixture binds into a soft dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate
at least an hour, a day or two is even better. There will be pastry left
over which can be frozen, or make a pie while the oven is on for the
pasties.

FILLING:

Mix together half the beef, half the onion, and one potato for each
filling. Season to taste with salt and pepper and sprinkle mixture with 1
teaspoon of the cornstarch. When ready to make pasties, remove pastry from
the refrigerator and prepare filling. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Roll out
pastry as for pie crust and cut out two large circles 10 inches in
diameter. Place filling in center. Brush edges of pastry with water and
fold one half of circle over to meet the other, creating a half-moon shape.
Press edges of pastry together lightly. Turn edges over about half an inch
and crimp so it won't open during baking. Make two half-inch slits near the
top of each pastry and place on a piece of baking parchment on a baking
sheet. Brush the pasties with milk and bake 15-20 minutes. Reduce heat to
375 degrees for about another 45 minutes, or until pasties are golden
brown.
