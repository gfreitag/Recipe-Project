Yield: 1 servings

2 tb Butter
1    Onion; sliced
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
3/4 c  -water, approx.
4 ts Vegetable oil
3 c  Flour;all purpose
1 1/2 ts -salt

3/4 c  Cheddar cheese; shredded

1/4 ts -pepper
1 tb Butter
1/3 c  Onion; finely chopped
1 c  Potatoes; cold mashed
DOUGH: In bowl, combine flour with salt. Beat together egg, water and oil;
stir into flour mixture to make soft but not sticky dough that holds
together in a ball. If necessary, add 1 Tbsp more water at a time, being
careful not to make dough sticky. Turn out dough onto lightly floured
surface; knead about 10 times or till smooth. Halve dough, cover with
plastic wrap or damp cloth. Let rest for 20 minutes. FILLING: Meanwhile in
skillet, heat butter over medium heat, cook onion for 3 to 5 minutes or
till tender. Transfer to a bowl, add mix in potatoes, cheese, salt and
pepper. Working with one portion of the dough at a time, and keeping the
remaining dough covered, roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/16"
thickness. Using 3 inch round cutter, cut dough into rounds. Place 1 tsp
filling on each round. Lightly moisten edge of one half of dough with
water, pinch edges together to seal and crimp attractively. Place on cloth;
cover with damp cloth to prevent drying out. Repeat with remaining portion
of dough. In large pot of boiling salted water, cook perogies in batches,
for 1 1/2 hr to 2 minutes or till they float to top, stirring gently to
prevent perogies from sticking together or to bottom of pan. With slotted
spoon remove to colander to drain. In large heavy skillet, melt butter over
medium heat, cook onion for about 5 minutes till golden. Add perogies and
toss to coat and warm through. Serve with sour cream. MAKES ABOUT 30
PEROGIES.

Variations: Cottage Cheese: Combine 1 cup press cottage cheese, 1 beaten
egg, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 Tbsp chopped green onion. Mushroom:
In skillet, melt 2 Tbsp butter over medium heat, cook 3 cups chopped
mushrooms and 1/3 cup finely chopped onion for 7 to 9 minutes or until
moisture has evaporated. Remove from heat; stir in 1 egg yolk and 1 Tbsp
chopped fresh dill. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
