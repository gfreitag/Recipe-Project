Categories: Beef, German
Yield: 6 servings
1 pn Mace
1 lg Steak (just over 1 lb), at
-least 1 1/4 inches
1    Shallot or small onion cut
-into small pieces
Freshly ground black pepper
((Note:  Per Horst Scharfenberg, this recipe originated in the town of
Idar-Oberstein in the 19 th century, when gemstone prospectors returning
from South America created their own version of gaucho-grilled steaks. The
dish was then further refined by Scharfenberg's mentor August Goerg. K.B.))

Per person: thick, trimmed

Mix together the shallot or onion with the pepper and mace. Insert a few
shallot pieces into the steak using the point of a small knife.  Coat the
steak with the shallot mixture, pressing it in so it will adhere.

Remove the loose shallot pieces and grill the steak (over a fire of oak
logs, says August Goerg, from which the bark has been removed).*  Take the
steaks off the grill while they are still pink inside.  Sprinkle them with
salt.

*Note:  A special grill is used, suspended with 3 chains from an iron
tripod and constantly swinging through the flames.
