Title: Icelandic Snowflake Breads (Laufabraud)
Categories: Breads, Ethnic
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Melted butter
2 c  Milk, heated to boiling
4 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 tb Sugar
hot fat for frying powdered sugar (optional)

In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and sugar.  Mix in the butter and
hot milk until a stiff dough is formed.  Turn out onto a lightly oiled
surface and knead until smooth and cooled. Divide dough into four parts.
Shape each into a ball.  Divide each into 4 parts to make 16, then divide
each of the resulting balls into 2 parts to total 32.

Cover baking sheets with waxed paper and dust the waxed paper lightly with
flour.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out each part of dough to make a thin
round about 8 inches in diameter.  Place the rounds on the floured waxed
paper.  Chill 30 minutes.

In a skillet, heat 2 inches of fat to 375 to 400 degrees F. Vegetable
shortening or corn or peanut oil may be used but the authentic fat is lard.

Fold gthe dough rounds, one at the time, into quarters, and, with a
sharp-tipped knife, make little cuts and cut-outs in the dough. Fry the
bread rounds, until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. Remove and
drain on paper toweling.  Store in an airtight container in a cool place or
in the freezer until ready to serve.
