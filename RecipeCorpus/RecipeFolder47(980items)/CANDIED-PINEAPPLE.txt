Sugar

In 3 qt casserole, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup reserved juice and
the corn syrup. Arrange five pineapple slices in single layer over
sugar mixture. Microwave on High 8-12 min. or until sugar dissolves
and slices are glossy and transparent on edges, turning over and
rearranging every 4 minutes. Remove slices to wire rack and cool.
They will become more transparent as they cool.  Add remaining slices
to the hot syrup and repeat as above. When slices have cooled
completely, coat with sugar. Cover with wax paper and let stand on
wire rack at least 24 hours to dry. Recoat with sugar. Slices will be
slightly sticky. Store in airtight container with wax paper between
layers no longer than 2 weeks.
