EQUIPMENT: 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, stainless steel bowl, 9 x 3-inch
springform pan, electric mixer with paddle, rubber spatula, red
toothpick, 10-inch plate, serrated slicer, large 100%-cotton kitchen
towel, cake spatula Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. To prepare the
caramel flavoring, combine the granulated sugar and lemon juice in a
2 1/2-qt saucepan and stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will
resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 5 to 6 minutes over
medium-high heat, stirring constantly to break up any lumps (the
sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then brown as it
caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully add the
heavy cream; stir to combine (the mixture will steam and boil rapidly
as the cream is added). Transfer the caramel to a stainless steel
bowl and allow to cool to room temperature. Continued >>>
