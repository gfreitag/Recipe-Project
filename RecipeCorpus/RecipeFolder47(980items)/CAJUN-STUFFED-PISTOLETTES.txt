*Pistolettes are small football-shaped crusty rolls that are the
brown and serve kind. They recommended using Earth Grain. Saute
onions, bell pepper, celery and shallots in butter until translucent.
Add milk, velveeta, water, shrimp, crabmeat and seasonings. Cook on
low just until heated through. In semi-deep fat, fry pistolettes
until they are browned. While still hot, holding them in a pot
holder, make a slit in the end and stuff with seafood mixture. Eat
immediately. Source: TV show with Frank Davis, N.O. (wrv)
