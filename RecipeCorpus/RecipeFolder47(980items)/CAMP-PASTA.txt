Heat water to a boil in a large pot.  In a smaller pot cook the meat
and add the sauce mix, water, and tomato paste according to the
instructions on the sauce package. Cook the pasta in the water for
8-10 minutes. Place the lid on the pot and with gloves or pot holders
drain the water from the pasta through the crack between the lid and
the pot. Puttingthe pot on a stump or log and letting the stump or
log hold the weight of the pot helps. Mix the sauce with the drained
pasta and serve . Grated cheese may be used with the pasta. Pasta
notes: Spagetti is the traditional pasta, but wheels, or other forms
that are more compact and larger will be much easier to drain.
