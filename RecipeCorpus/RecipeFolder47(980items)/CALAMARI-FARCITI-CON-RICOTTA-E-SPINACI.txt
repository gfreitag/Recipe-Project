Title: CALAMARI FARCITI CON RICOTTA E SPINACI
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
8 lg Squid
1 md Onion; minced
1    Garlic clove; minced
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Butter, unsalted
1/2 lb Spinach, fresh; trimmed
2/3 lb Ricotta
1    Egg
1 tb Parsley, Italian; chopped
Kosher salt; to taste
Pepper, black; to taste
1/2 c  Wine, white, dry
2 c  Tomato, plum
1    Lemon; quartered
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Clean the squid and chop the
tentacles finely.  Set them aside. Saut 82 the onion and the garlic
in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter until the onion is
soft. Add the tentacles and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the spinach and
saut E9, stirring, until it has wilted. Drain off any extra liquid
and cool the spinach. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, egg,
parsley, and the cooled spinach mixture. Mix thoroughly and season
with salt, pepper, and hot pepper flakes. Stuff the mixture loosely
into the squid and close the openings securely with a toothpick. Use
the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rectangular baking
dish large enough to hold the squid comfortably in one layer. Arrange
the squid in the dish and add the wine and tomatoes. Season with
salt, pepper and more hot pepper flakes, if you wish. Bake for 40 to
45 minutes, or until the squid is tender and the sauce has thickened.
If there is too much sauce, raise the oven temperature and allow the
liquid to reduce.  If there is too little, add more white wine. Serve
the squid with lemon quarters. Do not overstuff the squid or they may
split while they cook.  Rice and braised fennel go well with this
dish.
