Title: BUTTERSCOTCH CREAM PIE
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  Milk
2/3 c  Light brown sugar
1 pn Salt
1/3 c  Cornstarch
3 lg Eggs
4 tb Unsalted butter -- softened
2 ts Vanilla extract
Topping:
1 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
Prepare and bake the crust. To make the filling, combine 2 cups milk,
sugar and salt in a nonreactive saucepan; whisk once to mix and bring
to a boil over low heat. Place remaining 1/2 cup milk in a mixing
bowl and whisk in cornstarch, then eggs. Return milk and sugar
mixture to a boil over low heat then whisk about a third of it into
the egg mixture. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more
and whisk in the egg mixture, whisking constantly until the filling
thickens and comes to a boil. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for
about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, whisk in butter and vanilla; pour
into a nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of
the filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees. Spread
the cooled filling evenly in the cooled crust. To finish the pie,
whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla until it holds a firm peak.
Use a hand mixer on medium speed or a heavyduty mixer fitted with the
whisk. Spread the cream over the filling, making sure it touches the
edges of the crust all around. Yield: One 9 inch pie
