Categories: Vegetables, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 28 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 18 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A bushel weighs 18 pounds and yields 3 to 9 quarts--an average of 4
pounds per quart.

Quality: Can only freshly harvested greens. Discard any wilted,
discolored, diseased, or insect-damaged leaves. Leaves should be
tender and attractive in color.

Procedure: Wash only small amounts of greens at one time. Drain water
and continue rinsing until water is clear and free of grit. Cut out
tough stems and midribs. Place 1 pound of greens at a time in
cheesecloth bag or blancher basket and steam 3 to 5 minutes or until
well wilted. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to each quart jar, if desired.
Fill jars loosely with greens and add fresh boiling water, leaving
