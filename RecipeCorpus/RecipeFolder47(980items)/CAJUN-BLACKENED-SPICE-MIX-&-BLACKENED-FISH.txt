Title: CAJUN BLACKENED SPICE MIX & BLACKENED FISH
Categories: Spice mix, Seafood
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Paprika
2 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Cayenne pepper
3/4 ts White pepper
3/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Sage
-White fish fillets
-Vegetable oil
Mix all spices together and store in a tight jar. Heat 1 tablespoon
vegetable oil in cast iron skillet on medium high heat until very
hot, but not quite smoking. Rinse fish fillets and pat dry with paper
towel. Rub a little oil on both sides of the fish and sprinkle spice
mix on both sides (generously, if you like it hot). Sear the fish in
the hot oil for about 1 minute.  Flip it and cook the other side. If
the fillets are thick, you may need to lower the heat and cover to
fully cook the fish. Serve with lemon wedges.
