12 sl French bread, crusts removed
2 ts Butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Apple juice
1 oz Butter
1/2 c  Raisins
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
6 oz Cream cheese
1/4 c  Pecan pieces
1 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Powdered sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla
This recipe is a combination of one given to me by the Santa Fe
School of Cooking and one tasted at the Border Grill in Los Angeles.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Tear
bread into bite-sized pieces and place in baking dish.

Toast in oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, over medium high heat, stir
the sugar continuously in a saucepan until it melts and turns a light
caramel color. Immediately add the water and apple juice.

Be careful; the caramel will bubble and splatter. Do not bend over
the pan when you do this! The caramel will partially solidify but
will liquefy again as you heat it. Add the butter and raisins. When
caramel is completely liquefied, remove from heat and stir in the
vanilla.

Pour mixture over the bread pieces in the baking dish. Make sure all
of the bread is well soaked with caramel. Place tablespoons of the
cream cheese throughout the bread. Sprinkle the top with pecans and
cinnamon.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 to 26 minutes, or until all but a
little of the caramel at the bottom of the dish is ab sorbed.

Lightly whip the cream. Add the sugar and vanilla. Serve the pudding
warm with the sweetened cream.

Note: You may add a peeled, chopped apple or pear to the pudding
before it is baked.
