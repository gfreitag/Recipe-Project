Place egg white and glucose in a bowl.  Add the powdered sugar and
mix together with a wooden spoon. Knead with the fingers until the
mixture forms a ball, then knead on a surface dusted with powdered
sugar until smooth and free from cracks.  Wrap in plastic wrap, and
place into a plastic bag, then place into a air-tight container. Will
keep up to 3 months.  If it is hard after a long period of storage,
pick off very hard edges, then knead small amounts at a time until
you have the amount you wish to use.
