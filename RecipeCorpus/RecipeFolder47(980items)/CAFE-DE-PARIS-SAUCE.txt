1. Whip all ingredients together. Make sure that the Garlic
Marinara is very thick. If it is too runny, the liquid from the
mussels will make this dish too watery. The butter, too, is very
strongly seasoned so that only the minumum need be added to give
the right flavor. We serve this light natural tasting steamed
dish with rice.
