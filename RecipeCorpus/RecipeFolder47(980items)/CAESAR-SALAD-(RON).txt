and 1 Tb of the olive oil. Whisk in garlic, worcestershire and
mustard and blend until thoroughly combined. With a gentle rolling
motion, incorporate the romaine. Add the vinegar and the remaining
olive oil in the proportions of 1 part vinegar to 2 parts oil, until
you have the consistency and flavor you desire. Roll the salad again,
adding black pepper to taste. The salad can be chilled at this point,

croutons in the center of the salad and the Parmesan in a ring around
the circumference. Roll gently to serve.
