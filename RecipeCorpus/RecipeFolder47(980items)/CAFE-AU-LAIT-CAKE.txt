Preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Heat
liqueur and instant coffee in a small saucepan and stir until coffee
dissolves. Add enough milk to equal 1 cup liquid and set aside. In a
small bowl, whisk together cocoa powder and confectioners' sugar and
set aside. In a large electric mixer bowl, beat butter until very
soft. Add granulated sugar, vanilla and salt and beat until light.
Add eggs one at a time and beat well after each addition. In a medium
bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and soda. Fold flour mixture
into butter mixture alternately with coffee liquid. Turn half batter
into prepared pan and smooth surface. Using back of kitchen teaspoon,
make an indentation 1/2 inch deep in batter. Spoon
cocoa-confectioners' sugar mixture into depression. Spoon remaining
batter over top of cocoa mixture. Using broad side of dinner knife,
cut down through batter to bottom of pan, moving knife in zigzag
pattern to create a marbled effect. Smooth batter surface with back
of spoon. Bake 50-55 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center
comes out clean. Remove cake from oven and cool in pan on rack 15
minutes. Run knife around center tube and outer edge of pan.
Carefully invert onto rack and cool to room temperature. Dust lightly
with confectioners' sugar. If you don't want to use alcohol in this
recipe, just use strong coffee.
