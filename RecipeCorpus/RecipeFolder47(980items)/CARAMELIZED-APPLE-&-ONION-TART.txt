knives, cut the butter and shortening into the flour mixture until it
resembles coarse meal. Add water, 1 Tbsp at a time, until the dough
begins to come together. Form into disk; chill for 15 minutes.

For the filling, in a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add
the apples, onion, garlic and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally,
until the apples are golden, about 15 minutes. On a lightly floured
surface, roll out the dough to a 12x16 -inch rectangle. Transfer to a
baking sheet. Spoon the filling onto the shell to within 1 1/2-inches
of the edges. Fold the edges over the filling to form a border.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.
