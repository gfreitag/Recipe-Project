meat stand 30 minutes.  This works well when smoking brisket. Rub
mixture on meaty side of 2 briskets. Do not trim fat from fat side.
Place meaty sides together, roll, and retie.  Place in smoker for 8
to 10 hours depending on size of brisketss.  Use meat thermometer to
determine doneness. For ribs, rub mixture all over ribs and cook as
you alwaaaays do. This amount will be enough for 6 to 8 pork chops.
