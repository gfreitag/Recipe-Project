Title: CANNING DRIED BEANS OR PEAS (SHELLED)~ ALL VA
Categories: Vegetables, Legumes
Yield: 1 Text  Quantity: An average of 5 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 3-1/4 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
pints--an average of 3/4 pounds per quart.

Quality: Select mature, dry seeds. Sort out and discard discolored
seeds.

Procedure: Place dried beans or peas in a large pot and cover with
water. Soak 12 to 18 hours in a cool place. Drain water. To quickly
hydrate beans, you may cover sorted and washed beans with boiling
water in a saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, soak 1 hour
and drain. Cover beans soaked by either method with fresh water and
boil 30 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt per pint or 1 teaspoon per
quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with beans or peas and
cooking water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process as recommended in Table 1 or Table 2
according to the method of canning used.
