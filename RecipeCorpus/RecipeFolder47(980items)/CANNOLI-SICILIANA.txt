1/2 c  Superfine sugar

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the center, and
add the wine and sugar.  Work the flour into the center until you
have a rather firm dough, something like noodle dough. If the dough
is too crumbly add more wine, but do not let it become sticky. Place
dough on a lightly floured pastry cloth or board and knead it and
pound it vigorously for about 15 minutes.  It should be perfectly
smooth by then. Form it into a ball, wrap in a clean, slightly
dampened cloth, and let it rest for 2 hours.  When it has rested,
roll it out on the pastry cloth or board until very thin (no more
than 1/16 inch). Cut it into 5-inch squares and roll it around the
metal tubes as follows: take a square and place it before you diamond
fashion; one of the points toward you. Place the tube vertically
across the middle of the diamond, each end at a point of the dough.
Fold the sides over the tube, moistening the overlap with a little
water and pressing together.  When all the squares have been thus
rolled, place them, a few at a time, into deep fat preheated to 375
degrees F. Remove them when they are golden brown (tongs are best for
this, as the rolls are fragile) and let them drain on absorbent
paper. When they are cool, slip off the tubes, and fill with the
ricotta filling.

Press the ricotta through a fine sieve into a bowl. Beat it until it
is creamy and smooth.  Beat in the rest of the ingredients with a
large fork. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tube (or
merely use the nozzle, without a tube) and pipe the filling into the
cooled shells. Makes 12 cannoli.  Source: Great Italian Cooking by
