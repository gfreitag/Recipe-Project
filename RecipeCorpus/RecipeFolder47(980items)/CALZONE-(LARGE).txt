Title: CALZONE (LARGE)
Categories: Calzone
1 c  Warm water
Yield: 3 Servings
1/2 ts Sugar
1 pk Active dry yeast
3 c  Flour -- divided
2 TB Oil
1/2 ts Salt
12 oz Mozzarella cheese --
shredded
:
6 oz Creamy goat cheese
3 TB Chives -- chopped
1 TB Garlic -- minced
2 TB Parmesan cheese -- grated

Combine water and sugar in large bowl; sprinkle with yeast. Let stand
5 minutes to soften.  Add 1 1/2 cups flour; Beat with mixer until
smooth. Stir in oil and salt. Gradually blend in enough of remaining
flour with wooden spoon to make moderately stiff dough. Turn out onto
lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth. Return to bowl; cover
and let rise in warm place until doubled. Punch down dough; divide
into three equal portions. Roll one potion on lightly floured surface
to a 9 inch circle. Place 1/3 of the mozzarella on one side of the
dough; dot with 1/3 of the goat cheese. Repeat with remaining dough
and cheeses. Mix chives and garlic; sprinkle over filling. Moisten
edges of dough with water and fold over to enclose filling. Press
edges firmly together. Place on lightly greased baking sheets. Let
rise for 30 to 45 minutes or until dough feels light to the touch.
Cut slit in each calzone to allow steam to escape. Preheat oven to
375 F. Bake 30 to 45 minutes or until browned. Remove from oven;
brush tops with oil. Sprinkle each with grated parmesan cheese. Serve
warm.
