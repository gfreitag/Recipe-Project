Title: CAMPFIRE MEATBALLS
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Ground beef
1/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
1    Egg; slightly beaten
3/4 ts Garlic salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Heavy aluminum foil
2 md Zucchini; halved,
-- then sliced crosswise
-- into 1/2 inch slices.
2 c  Prepared spaghetti sauce
Grated Parmesan cheese
Garlic bread sticks
-- (optional)
1. In medium bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, 1/4 cup
water, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Shape
into 24 (approx 1-1/4 inch) meatballs.

2. Cut four 18x12 inch long sheets heavy duty aluminum foil. Place
equal amounts of meatballs and zucchini in center of each; top each
with 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce. Bring shorter edges of foil together
over the center; fold down loosely to seal, allowing room for heat
expansion and circulation. Fold in open ends to seal.

3. Place packets on grid over medium ash-covered coals, Grill,
uncovered, 16 to 18 minutes or until meatball centers are no longer
pink and zucchini is tender, truning packets over once.

4. To serve, carefully unfold ends and tops of packets; sprinkle
cheese over meatballs. Serve with garlic bread sticks, dipping into
sauce, if desired.

Cooks tip: To check the temperature of the coals, cautiously hold
your hand palm side down, at cooking height (just above the grid).
Count the number of seconds you can hold your hand in that position
before the heat is uncomfortable and you have to pull it away; 4
seconds for medium coals.
