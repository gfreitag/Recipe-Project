Categories: Breads
Yield: 3 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
2 1/4 c  Warm water (110 to 115
-degrees)
2 tb Molasses
4 ts Caraway seeds
1 tb Vegetable oil
2 ts Salt
4 c  Unbleached white flour
2 c  Dark rye flour
1    Egg
1/4 c  Milk
Stir yeast into warm water in a large mixing bowl; let sit for 10
minutes. Stir in molasses, caraway seeds, oil and salt. Mix well.
Stir in flours, 1 cup at a time. Mix well and turn out onto a floured
surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 to 10 minutes. Put dough in an
oiled mixing bowl and turn to coat surface. Cover and let rise until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough and shape into 3 round loaves. Place on a buttered
baking sheet, cover and let rise for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees and place a shallow pan with 1" of hot water on the rack
below where the bread will be baking. Beat egg lightly with milk and
brush on the loaves. Bake for 15 minutes, then brush with the egg
mixture once again. Bake another 15 minutes or until loaves are
golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Cool on wire racks. Makes
3 loaves.
