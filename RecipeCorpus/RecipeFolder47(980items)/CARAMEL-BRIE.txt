Title: CARAMEL BRIE
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 38 Servings
1    Wheel Brie - (60% butterfat
-- about 2.8 pounds)
2 c  Sugar - granulated
1/2 c  Water
16    Walnut halves - or pecan
-halves (12 - 16 optional)
Number of Servings:  38

Put the Brie on a rack over a large sheet of parchment paper or
aluminum foil. Combine sugar and water in a heavy saucepan and melt
the sugar, swirling the pan from time to time. Do not stir. When the
mixture

begins to boil, cover the pan to allow condensation to drip back down
and melt the crystallized sugar on the side of the pan. Uncover the
pan after 3 to 5 minutes and continue cooking over high heat until
sugar becomes a deep golden color.  The temperature of the caramel
should be hard crack, 300F. Immediately pour the caramel over the
cheese to cover the top evenly, allowing the excess to drip down the
sides. You may have to tilt the cheese a little to spread the caramel
evenly. Be very careful not to touch the hot caramel. Press nuts
around the perimeter, if desired. The caramel will harden quickly.
Serve within an hour. Present the cheese with small cheese knifes.
The guests will have to crack through the caramel coating, but this
is part of the fun of eating such an unusual treat.

NOTE:  When working with melted sugar or caramel, always keep a bowl
of ice water nearby. If you should burn yourself, plunge the burned
area into the water.

to her friend, Ruth Leserman).
