Title: CANDIED YAMS WITH RUM & RAISINS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Yams or sweet potatoes; med
4 tb Butter or margarine
1/3 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
3 tb Rum or orange juice
1/2 c  Raisins
Boil whole yams 20 to 40 minutes or until tender but not mushy. Drain
and cool, then cut into 1/4 inch thick slices. Arrange slices,
overlapping, in a buttered shallow casserole. Dot with butter, then
sprinkle with brown sugar and raisins. Drizzle with rum. Bake
uncovered at 350 or until bubbly and glazed. This recipe is adapted
from Sunset "Easy Basics for Good Cooking". It is absolutely my
favorite because it is not gooey sweet. Besides, I love raisins !
