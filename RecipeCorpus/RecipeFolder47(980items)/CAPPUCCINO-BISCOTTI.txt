1 ts Milk
1    Egg yolk, large

1/2 c  Chocolate chips, semisweet
*To toast & skin hazelnuts, put in one layer in preheated 350F oven
for 10 to 15 minutes or until they are colored lightly and skins
blistered. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel and let them steam for 1
minute. Rub the nuts in the towel to remove as much skin as possible
and let them cool.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
blend the flour, the sugar, the baking soda, the baking powder, the
salt, the cinnamon and the cloves until the mixture is combined well.
In a small bowl whisk together the espresso, the milk, the yolk and
the vanilla, adding the mixture to the flour mixture , beating until
a dough is formed, and stir in the hazelnuts and chocolate chips.
Turn out the dough onto a floured surface, knead it several times
and halve it. Working on a large buttered and floured baking sheet,
with floured hands, form each piece of dough into a flattish log 12
inches long by 2 inches wide and arrange the logs at least 3 inches
apart on the sheet.
Bake the logs in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 35 minutes
and let them cool on the baking sheet on a rack for about 10 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 300F. On a cutting board, cut the logs
crosswise on the diagonal into 3/4 inch slices , arrange the
biscotti, cut sides down, on the baking sheet, and bake them for 5 to
6 minutes on each side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the
biscotti to racks to cool and store them in airtight containers.
