Peel the squash and remove seeds. Cut into small 1/4 inch dice. Set
aside. Heat the butter and oil together in a deep saucepan and saute
the onions and garlic until soft but not browned. Add the squash and
rice and continue to saute and stir for 2-3 minutes longer. Add wine
and stir until absorbed. Add stock in 1/2 cup increments stirring
until absorbed. Continue adding stock and stirring until rice is
creamy on outside but has some texture to it. Gently stir in cheese,
zest, nutmeg and correct seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve
immediately in warm bowls garnished with chopped chives, additional
Parmesan and a drizzle of fresh basil oil, if desired.
