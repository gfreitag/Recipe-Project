1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Brown Sugar
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 c  Oatmeal
1/4 ts Baking soda
Cream the butter and shortening; gradually add the brown sugar, then
the flour, oatmeal and soda. This will give you a very stiff dough,
which you will have to knead with the hands to work smooth. Do not be
tempted to add liquid.If it will not hold to-gether its because the
shortening and butter were not sufficiently well creamed. Divide into
two portions and roll half to 1/4 in. thickness and spread out on
bottom of a greased pan. Cover with following date mixture: 1/2 cup
of dates chopped, 1/2 cup brown sugar, one tblsp. cornstarch, 1 cup
of hot water. Cook till thick stirring constantly. Spread over
oatmeal mixture and roll second oatmeal portion and put on top. Bake
about 1 hour in 350 oven.
