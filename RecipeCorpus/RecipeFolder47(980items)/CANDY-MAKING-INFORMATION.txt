Stages of Syrup Cooking Slightly more cooking
is required on damp or rainy days than on a dry , clear day.
Allowance is made for this in the following table. The higher
temperature should be used on a damp day while the lower is right for
clear weather. Soft ball, for fondant, fudge, panocha_______________
234F. to 238F. Firm ball, for caramels______________________________
246F. to 248F. Hard ball, for taffy_________________________________
265F. to 270F. Crack stage, for butterscotch________________________
290F. to 300F. Hard crack, for brittles, sticks, lollypops__________
300F. to 310F. Hard crack stage, for clear hard candies_____________
to 310F.
Cold Water Test
Pour about 1/2 teaspoon os the hot candy into a cup nearly full
of very cold water. Shape the syrup with the fingers of one hand.
Soft ball: The syrup can be formed into a soft ball which flatens on
removal from the water. Firm ball: The syrup can be formed into a
ball which offers some resistance to the fingers. Hard ball: The ball
which is formed is distinctly chewy. Crack: The mixture sounds britle
when struck against the side of the cup; it can be broken by crushing
between the fingers. Hard crack: The brittle mixture will not stick
to the teeth.
If a thermometer is used, it should be tested in boiling water. It
should register 212 F. If 214 F., cook candy 2 degrees higher, if 210
F., cook candy 2 degrees lower. Make your adjustments accordingly.
