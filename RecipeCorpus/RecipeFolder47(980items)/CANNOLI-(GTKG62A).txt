Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM-------------------------FOR PASTA------------------------------
1 1/3 c  Flour
Pinch of salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Grated orange or lemon rind
1 tb Butter
Marsala wine
1    Egg white, beaten
Oil; for frying
MMMMM------------------------FOR FILLING-----------------------------
1 lb Ricotta cheese
2 tb Miniature chocolate bits, or
Shaved semi-sweet chocolate
1 tb Candied citron, or glaced
Fruit; slivered
2 tb Sugar
PASTA: Combine flour, salt, sugar, citrus rind and butter and blend
well. Add Marsala by the teaspoonful until dough is stiff. Chill for
2 hours. Roll dough on a lightly-floured board into a large
rectangle. Cut into 4" squares. Wrap squares around cannoli tubes so
that 2 corners fold over and two corners point outward. Brush the
touching corners with egg white so that they will stick together.
Deep fry in hot oil until golden. Cool and remove from tubes. Fill.
Makes 10 to 12 cannoli. If you don't have cannoli tubes, make 2"
diameter tubes out of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold dough
accordingly. FILLING: Combine all ingredients and fill the cannoli.
