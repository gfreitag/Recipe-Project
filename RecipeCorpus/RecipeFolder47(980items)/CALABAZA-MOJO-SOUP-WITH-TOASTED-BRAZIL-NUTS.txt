Heat 3 Tbsp. olive oil in a large nonreactive saucepan. Add the onion

Add the calabaza, vegetable stock, and orange juice and bring to a

calabaza is very soft, about 25 min. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to

Season with salt. Can be prepared to this point and refrigerated for

temperature. Using a slotted spoon, transfer 1 1/2 cups of the
vegetable to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. Stir
the puree back into the soup and season with salt. Ladle the soup
into shallow bowls and garnish with the sliced Brazil nuts.
