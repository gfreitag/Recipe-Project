Title: BUTTERSCOTCH BROWNIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Butter, melted
2 c  Light brown sugar
3    Eggs
2 ts Vanilla
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Chopped walnuts, pecans, etc
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Butter
3 c  Sifted confectioners sugar
2 ts Instant coffee*
* dissolved in 2 Tablespoons hot water

These chewy squares ooze brown sugary butterscotch. They becrumb the
lips and besmear the chin, like home-baked goodies should.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add sugar and beat well to mix.
Cool the mixture slightly, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.

Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Stir it into the wet
ingredients, then add the nuts. Mix well. Spread brownies in a
greased 11 x 7 x 2-inch pan and bake at 350ø for 30 to 35 minutes or
until a light gold. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out.
This is easiest if you up-end the pan over waxed paper, then turn the
cake right side up. Let it finish cooling on a rack.

To make the frosting, cream 1/2 cup butter with confectioners sugar.
Beat it until light, then beat in the coffee mixture. Spread over the
brownies. When frosting has set, cut in squares.

Yield: 3 dozen 2-inch or 6 dozen 1-inch squares. Polly Clingerman,
