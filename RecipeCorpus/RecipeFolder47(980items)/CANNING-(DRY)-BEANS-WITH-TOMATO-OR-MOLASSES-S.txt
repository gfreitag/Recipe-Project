Categories: Canning
Yield: 1 Text  Quantity: An average of 5 pounds of beans is needed per canner load
of 7 quarts; an average of 3-1/4 pounds is needed per canner load of
9 pints--an average of 3/4 pounds per quart.

Quality: Select mature, dry seeds. Sort out and discard discolored
seeds.

Procedure: Sort and wash dry beans. Add 3 cups of water for each cup
of dried beans or peas. Boil 2 minutes, remove from heat and soak 1
hour and drain. Heat to boiling in fresh water, and save liquid for
making sauce. Make your choice of the following sauces:

Tomato Sauce--Either mix 1 quart tomato juice, 3 tablespoons sugar, 2
teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon chopped onion, and 1/4 teaspoon each of
ground cloves, allspice, mace, and cayenne pepper; or mix 1 cup
tomato ketchup with 3 cups of cooking liquid from beans. Heat to
boiling. Add 3 quarts cooking liquid from beans and bring back to
boiling.

Molasses Sauce--Mix 4 cups water or cooking liquid from beans, 3
tablespoons dark molasses, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 2 teaspoons salt,
and 3/4 teaspoon powdered dry mustard. Heat to boiling.

Fill jars three-fourths full with hot beans. Add a 3/4-inch cube of
pork, ham, or bacon to each jar, if desired. Fill jars with heated
sauce, leaving 1-inch headspace.
