Title: CAMPER'S BAKED POTATOES
Categories: Side dishes
Yield: 8 Servings
6    Baking potatoes
1    Onion -- chopped
4 oz Green chiles
4 oz Black olives -- chopped
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Lemon pepper
Aluminum foil
1. Scrub and chop baking potatoes into pieces, but do not peel.

2. Prepare 6-8 square pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil, one piece
per serving. Place equal portions of the ingredients on each foil
square. Fold the foil in a drug-store type fold, sealing ends.

3. Place on barbecue grill for about 45-55 minutes. If you can safely
take along margarine, you might want to add a teaspoon or so to each
packet before grilling.
