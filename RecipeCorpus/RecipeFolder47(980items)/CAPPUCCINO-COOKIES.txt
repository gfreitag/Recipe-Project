Categories: Dessert, Cookies, Posted-mm
Yield: 60 Servings
1 c  Butter, softened
2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
2 tb Milk
2 tb Instant coffee granules
2 lg Eggs
1 ts Rum extract
1/2 ts Vanilla
4 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Salt
Chocolate sprinkles
-or-  melted
Chocolate (optional)
BEAT butter in large bowl with electric mixer at medium speed until
smooth. Add sugar; beat until well blended.

HEAT milk in small saucepan over low heat; add coffee granules,
stirring to dissolve. Add milk mixture, eggs, rum extract and vanilla
to butter mixture. Beat at medium speed until well blended.

COMBINE flour, baking powder, nutmeg and salt in large bowl.
Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating at low speed
after each addition until blended.

SHAPE dough into 2 logs, about 8 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.
(Dough will be soft; sprinkle lightly with flour if too sticky to
handle.)

ROLL logs in chocolate sprinkles, if desired, coating evenly ('/3 cup
sprinkles per roll). Or, leave rolls plain and dip cookies in melted
chocolate after baking. Wrap each log in plastic wrap; refrigerate
overnight.

PREHEAT oven to 350"F. Grease cookie sheets. Cut rolls into
'/4-inch-thick slices; place 1 inch apart on cookie sheets. (Keep
unbaked rolls and sliced cookies chilled until ready to bake.)

BAKE 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to wire racks to
cool. Dip plain cookies in melted semisweet or white chocolate, if
desired. Store in airtight container.

Makes about 60 cookies

*To dip 24 cookies, melt 1 cup chocolate chips in small saucepan over
very low heat until smooth.
