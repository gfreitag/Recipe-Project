MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
MMMMM---------------------VEGETABLE MIXTURE--------------------------
2 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
1/2 c  Finely chopped bell pepper
1/4 c  Finely chopped green onions
2 ts Minced garlic
1/2 ts Tabasco sauce
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Catsup
MMMMM--------------------------MEAT MIX-------------------------------
1 1/2 lb Ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 c  Very fine dry bread crumbs
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

Melt the butter in a 1 quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the
onions, celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, Tabasco,
Worcestershire and seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking
excessively, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the
pan bottom well. Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for
about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow
mixture to cool to room temperature.

Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13 by 9 backing pan.
Add the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture (removing the bay leaves)
and the bread crumbs.  Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the
center of the pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1 1/2
inches high, 6 inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350
degrees for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400 degrees and continue
cooking until done, about 35 minutes longer.  Serve immediately as is
or with "Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef" (separate recipe).
