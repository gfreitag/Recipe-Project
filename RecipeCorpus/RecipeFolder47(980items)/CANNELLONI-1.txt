Categories: Italian, Pasta, Chicken
Yield: 8 Servings

There are many fillings for Cannelloni and there are easily as many
sauces. Here is one combination:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Saute the onions and mushrooms in
butter. Mince the chicken meat, chop the spinach. Add to the onions
and mushrooms along with nutmeg, salt and pepper. Simmer about 5
minutes. Allow to cool slightly. Add the Ricotta and cream. Mix
thoroughly and season to taste. Cook the noodles, 3 at a time, in
boiling salted water until al dente. Remove using a skimmer and blot
dry, inside and out. Fill each noodle tube with a heaping tablespoon
of the filling and place, seam side down, in a buttered, oven proof
dish. When all the cannelloni are in the pan, cover with a generous
amount of Italian style tomato sauce, some ground fresh basil and
melted butter. Sprinkle on some grated parmesan cheese or a thin
layer of mozzarella. Bake about ten minutes. Serve at once with
additional sauce and grated parmesan cheese.
