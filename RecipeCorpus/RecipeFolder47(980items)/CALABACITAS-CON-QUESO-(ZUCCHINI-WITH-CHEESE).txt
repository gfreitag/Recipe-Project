Title: CALABACITAS CON QUESO (ZUCCHINI WITH CHEESE)
Categories: Southwester, Stew, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Zucchini, unpeeled -- cut in
1/4    " cubes
1 c  Water
Salt and pepper
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 lg Garlic clove
1 c  Finely chopped onion
3/4 lb Chopped tomato
2 c  Corn kernels
2    Poblano peppers -- peeled
And chopped
5 oz Evaporated milk
1/2 lb Shredded monterey jack
Cheese
Substitutions:  1/3 cup heavy cream for 5 ounces of canned evaporated
milk; cheddar or colby for jack.

Approximations:  5 to 6 zucchini;  1 medium onion; 1 large or 2 small
tomatoes; 10-ounce bag of corn, or 16-ounce can. It is not necessary
to be so precise. It is a home cooking, seasonal cooking.

Place diced zucchini in medium saucepan with water, season lightly
with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, over
medium heat until slightly tender but still crunchy, about 2 minutes.
Set aside without draining.

Heat oil in large skillet over high heat until hot but not quite
smoking. Reduce heat slightly; add garlic and onion and cook,
stirring, until onion is translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato
and cook until liquid partly is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in
corn and poblanos and simmer 5 minutes.

Add undrained zucchinia and evaporated milk to corn-chili mixture and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, stir in diced or shredded cheese
and cook until the cheese melts. Serve hot (from 4 to 6 people).
