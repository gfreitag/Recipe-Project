Title: CALIFORNIA FRUIT BREAD
Categories: Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder (or 2
-T soy flour for milk free
-diets)
2 tb Lowfat soy flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Applesauce
2    Egg whites or 1/4 cup egg
-beaters [or egg sub. equiv]
2 sm (7 3/4") very ripe bananas
1    8-ounce can crushed
-pineapple, juice packed
1/2 c  Chopped, pitted dried
-apricots
1/2 c  Golden raisins
Spray loaf pan with Pam or ?. Open pineapple and drain off juice mix
dry ingredients together in large bowl. In blender, process together
applesauce, egg, bananas and pineapple add to dry mixture, add
apricots and raisins, beat just till well mixed. Turn into loaf pan,
baked in preheated 350F oven for 60 minutes or until golden and tests
done. Remove from pan and rest on a board or rack on its side till
completely cooled. Refrigerate wrapped.  Freezes well.

Now for the variables, I have made this with no apricots but with one
fresh apple, chopped ( not peeled). I have made this with and without
raisins. Less sweet but good both ways. I am eager to try it with
fresh bluberries in place of the apricots. I have also made it
without the pineapple because I forgot to buy some, instead I used 1
cup apple juice. If you don't have the soy flour or the dry milk,
just add the equivilent of flour or oat bran or??
