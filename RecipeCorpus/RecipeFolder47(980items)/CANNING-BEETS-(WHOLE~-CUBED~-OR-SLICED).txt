Title: CANNING BEETS (WHOLE~ CUBED~ OR SLICED)
Categories: Vegetables, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 21 pounds (without tops) is needed per canner
load of 7 quarts; an average of 13-1/2 pounds is needed per canner
load of 9 pints. A bushel (without tops) weighs 52 pounds and yields
15 to 20 quarts--an average of 3 pounds per quart.

Quality: Beets with a diameter of 1 to 2 inches are preferred for
whole packs. Beets larger than 3 inches in diameter are often fibrous.

Procedure: Trim off beet tops, leaving an inch of stem and roots to
reduce bleeding of color. Scrub well. Cover with boiling water. Boil
until skins slip off easily; about 15 to 25 minutes depending on
size. Cool, remove skins, and trim off stems and roots. Leave baby
beets whole. Cut medium or large beets into 1/2-inch cubes or slices.
Halve or quarter very large slices. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart
to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with hot beets and fresh hot water,
leaving 1-inch headspace.

Table 2 according to the method of canning used. Table 1. Recommended
