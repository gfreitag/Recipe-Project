Title: CAPE COD CRANBERRY MEATLOAF
Categories: Beef, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Whole cranberry sauce
3/4 c  Dark brown sugar -- packed
2 1/2 lb Ground chuck
1/2 c  Milk
1 md Onion -- finely chopped
1/4 c  Ketchup
1/2 c  Plain bread crumbs
2 lg Eggs -- lightly beaten
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Dried marjoram
1/4 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Dried rosemary
1 ts Salt
2    Bay leaves
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf
pan. In a small bowl, combine the cranberry sauce and brown sugar.
(NOTE: sometimes I add a few tablespoons of chili sauce for an extra
kick) Place the cranberry sauce mixture in the bottom of the prepared
loaf pan. In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients except
the bay leaves and mix well. Set the meatloaf mixture in the pan on
top of the sauce. Top the loaf with the bay leaves and bake for 1 1/2
hours or until done. Allow the loaf to cool for 20 minutes. Remove
the bay leaves. Very carefully turn the loaf onto a serving plate so
that the sauce side is up. Drizzle the pan juices over the loaf.
