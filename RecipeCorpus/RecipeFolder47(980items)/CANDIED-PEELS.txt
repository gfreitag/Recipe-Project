Title: CANDIED PEELS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Navel oranges
1 3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Clear corn syrup
1 1/2 c  Water
3 oz Orange gelatin
Cut oranges in half lengthwise & remove fruit.  Cut peels into
strips. Cook peels in 8 C. boiling water for 15 min. Drain & repeat.
In same pot, cook sugar, syrup, & 1-1/2 C. water over high heat until
sugar is dissolved. Add gelatin & peels & simmer for 20 min. Remove
from heat. On a sheet of waxed paper or microwave paper, sprinkle 1
C. granulated sugar. Lightly roll the peels in the sugar, a few at a
time, until the peel is evenly coated. Add sugar as needed as supply
is used. Place in one layer to dry overnight. Store in airtight
containers.  Will keep indefinately, if kept dry.

Lemon or Lime peels may be used with the corresponding gelatin, but
I've never tried it.

For slightly less sweet peels, delete the corn syrup & increase sugar
to 3 cups.
