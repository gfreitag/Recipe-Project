Title: BUTTERSCOTCH WALNUT BARS
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 4 Servings
-Crust -----------------
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Packed Light-Brown Sugar
1/2 c  Butter, Cut In 1/2 Inch Pcs
-Topping ----------------
1/4 c  Light Corn Syrup
6 oz Butterscotch Pieces
pn Salt
2 tb Butter Or Margarine
1 tb Water
8 oz Walnuts, Chopped
Medium-Fine
CRUST: In bowl mix flour, salt and sugar. With pastry blender cut in
butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Spread mixture evenly in
greased 13 x 9x 2 inch pan, then with hand press firmly into smooth
compact layer. Bak ein preheated 375 degree oven about 12 minutes or
until lightly browned. Remove pan to rack while you prepare topping.
TOPPING: Combine syrup, butterscotch pieces, salt, butter and water
in large heavy saucepan. With rubber spatula stir over low heat,
pressing butterscotch until melted and smooth. (A few tiny unmelted
pieces of butterscotch are all right.) Quickly stir in walnuts and
remove from heat. Working quickly to prevent mixture from hardening,
place large spoonfuls on warm baked crust. With back of spoon spread
mixture to within 1/2 to 3/4 inch of crust edges (during baking,
topping will run toward edges). Bake in 375 degree oven 10 minutes.
Cool in pan 30 to 40 minutes or until only slightly warm. With small
sharp knife loosen around edges, then cut in 16 bars. (Bars in center
of pan will appear too soft, but they will become firm as they cool;
wait to remove them.) With wide metal spatula transfer bars to
cutting board; cool thoroughly until firm. Cut each bar in half.
