Wash the kale in a large basin of cold water. Strip or cut leaves from

reserved corn cooking liquid to a boil, add chopped kale, and cook
for 5 minutes or until kale is just tender and still bright green.
Remove from cooking liquid with a slotted spoon and spread on a large

red and green pepper, onion, garlic, and Cajun spices.

Just before serving, toss with the lemon juice for a nonfat salad.
