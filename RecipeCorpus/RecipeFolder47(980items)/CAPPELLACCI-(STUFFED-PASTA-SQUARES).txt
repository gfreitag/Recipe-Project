MMMMM---------------------FOR COOKING WATER--------------------------
1 tb Oil
Combine 4 eggs, 2 teaspoons oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt in bowl and
whisk until well blended. Add flour, a little at a time, beating
after each addition. Turn out onto well-floured board and knead
several minutes until dough is firm and smooth but not dry. Add more
flour if necessary to prevent sticking. Cover and let stand at
slightly warm temperature about 30 minutes to ripen. Cut dough in
2-inch portions and roll out slightly to flatten enough to fit into
pasta machine. Roll in machine starting with thickest setting and
progressing to next to finest setting until pasta is very thin
(expansion takes place during cooking). Continue until all dough is
rolled into strips. Place strips on floured board and sprinkle
lightly with flour. Cut in 4-inch squares and let rest 10 minutes
before filling and cooking. Meanwhile, to make sauce, saute onion and
garlic in olive oil until golden. Add undrained tomatoes, basil and 2
teaspoons salt. Season with pepper to taste. Bring to boil and simmer
15 minutes. Add sugar at last minute. To make filling, combine
ricotta, drained spinach, nutmeg, 4 eggs and Parmesan to taste in
bowl and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring large
pot of generously salted water to boil. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Drop
each piece of pasta into boiling water and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or
just until pasta floats to surface. Remove at once and plunge into
bowl filled with ice water 1 minute. Drain pasta on clean cloth to
prevent sticking. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of each pasta
square. Fold square into triangle, then again into smaller triangle.
Press edges to seal. Pour layer of tomato sauce in large baking pan.
Arrange cappellacci in rows, slightly overlapping. Cover with
remaining sauce and sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese. Bake at
400F 5 to 7 minutes.
