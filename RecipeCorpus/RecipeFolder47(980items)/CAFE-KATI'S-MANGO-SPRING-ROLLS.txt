1 lg Carrot, shredded
2    Mangoes, peeled and sliced
1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves
1/2 c  Fresh mint leaves

Soak vermicelli in 2 cups warm water for about 15 minutes. Drain and
set aside.

Dip sheet of rice paper in warm water (approximately 110 degrees) and
transfer to work surface that is covered with a damp kitchen towel.
Wait about 30 seconds or until wrapper is pliable. Place a lettuce
leaf on the bottom two-thirds of the rice paper, leaving a 2-inch
border of paper on the bottom.

Place 2 tablespoons vermicelli, 1 tablespoon shredded carrots, 2
slices of mango, 1 tablespoon each of basil and mint, and 2
tablespoons bean sprouts on top of the lettuce.

Fold up the bottom 2-inch border of rice paper over the filling. Fold
upward again to enclose the filling. Fold in the right, then the left
edges of the wrapper. Continue folding until a tight cylinder is
formed. Transfer to a serving tray and cover with a damp paper towel.
Continue filling and rolling until all ingredients are used up.

Serve with Spicy Thai Vinaigrette as a dipping sauce.

Note: If you are in a hurry, simply julienne all the filling
ingredients; toss well to combine and use to fill the wrappers.

Makes 8 spring rolls.
