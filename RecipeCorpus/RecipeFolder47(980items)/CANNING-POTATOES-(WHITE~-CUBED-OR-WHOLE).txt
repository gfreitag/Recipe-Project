Title: CANNING POTATOES (WHITE~ CUBED OR WHOLE)
Categories: Vegetables, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 35 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 22-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
pints. A bag weighs 50 pounds and yields 8 to 12 quarts--an average
of 5 pounds per quart.

Quality: Select small to medium-size mature potatoes of ideal quality
for cooking. Tubers stored below 45 degrees F may discolor when
canned. Choose potatoes 1 to 2 inches in diameter if they are to be
packed whole.

Procedure: Wash and peel potatoes. Place in ascorbic acid solution to
prevent darkening. If desired, cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Drain. Cook 2
minutes in boiling water and drain again. For whole potatoes, boil 10
minutes and drain. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jar, if
desired. Fill jars with hot potatoes and fresh hot water, leaving
1-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 and
Table 2.
