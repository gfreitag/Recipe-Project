boiling water and simmer until tender.  Drain. Divide peel into 3
portions. Prepare a heavy sirup, using 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water.
Color 1 portion of sirup red, 1 portion green, and leave 1 portion

sufficient sirup to cover each portion of peel. Cook slowly until
tender. Allow to stand in sirup overnight. Drain thoroughly.  Roll in
granulated sugar. Place on cake rack. Dry in very slow oven (250 F)
