This Guyanese dish is from Bridgette de Souza at Caribbean Gardens. In
Guyana, taro leaves are called 'callaloo.'

Put the pig's tail in pot and cover with water; bring to a boil, and
boil for 1 hour.  Drain and set aside. Brown beef in oil, then add
tripe and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook at a gentle
boil for about 1 hour.  Add pig's tail and cook until liquid has
reduced to about 3 cups. Cut tripe into pieces and cut meat from
pig's foot; return meats to pot.

Add onion, garlic, taro leaves, Habanero, coconut milk and salt and
pepper to taste.  Simmer for 10 minutes. Add rice. Cover the pot,
reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, until mixture "looks
nice and green." Garnish with chopped red pepper.

Serves 8 to 10.
