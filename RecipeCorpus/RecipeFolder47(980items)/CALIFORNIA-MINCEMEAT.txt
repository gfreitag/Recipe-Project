IN A LARGE SKILLET set over moderate heat, stir-fry the onions,
garlic and green pepper in the olive oil for about 5 minutes, until
the vegetables are limp. Mix in the marjoram, thyme, cumin and
cinnamon, and cook over moderate heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the
beef and pork. Fry the meat, breaking up any large chunks, just until
the redness disappears; do not brown the meat. Add the wine and boil
it uncovered for 2 to 3 minutes, until it evaporates. Mix in the
remaining ingredients except the almonds, bring the mincemeat to a
simmer and adjust the heat so that it simmers very gently. Cover the
skillet and cook the mincemeat for 45 minutes, until the flavors are
well blended. Stir in the almonds and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5
minutes, stirring often, until they are heated through. Ladle the
mincemeat over rice, or slices of sourdough or French bread. Or,
spoon the meat into pita pockets or taco shells. Makes 6 to 8 servings
