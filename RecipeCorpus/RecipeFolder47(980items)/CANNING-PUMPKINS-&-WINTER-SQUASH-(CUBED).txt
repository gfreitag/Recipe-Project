Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 16 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 10 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
pints--an average of 2-1/4 pounds per quart.

Quality: Pumpkins and squash should have a hard rind and stringless,
mature pulp of ideal quality for cooking fresh. Small size pumpkins
(sugar or pie varieties) make better products.

mash or puree. Fill jars with cubes and cooking liquid, leaving
1-inch headspace.
