In large mixing bowl combine 2 cups flour and yeast. Heat and stir

minutes. Shape into ball. Place in greased bowl; turn once. Cover;
let rise till double, 45 to 60 minutes.

Punch down; divide in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Roll each
half to 12x8-inch rectangle. Brush with the melted butter. Combine
remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough.
Roll each up jelly-roll style, starting with long side; seal seams.
Slice each roll into 12 pieces. In saucepan mix brown sugar, 1/4 cup
butter, and corn syrup; cook and stir till butter melts. Distribute
mixture evenly in two 9 x 1 1/2-inch round baking pans. Top with
nuts. Place 12 rolls, cut side down, in each prepared pan. Cover; let
rise till double (about 30 minutes). Bake at 375 for 18 to 20
minutes. Cool 30 seconds; invert on rack and remove pans.
