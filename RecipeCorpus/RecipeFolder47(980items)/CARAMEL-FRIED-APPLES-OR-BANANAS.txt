Title: CARAMEL FRIED APPLES OR BANANAS
Categories: Chinese, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  All purpose flour
2 tb Cornstarch
3/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Water
2    Golden Delicious apples -or-
2    Bananas
Salad oil
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Warm water
1 tb Salad oil
2 ts Sesame seeds
In a bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Add water and
stir until smooth.  Peel and core apples; cut each apple into 3
wedges. (If you use bananas, peel and cut in 1/2 inch thick diagonal
slices.) Place fruit in batter and turn to coat evenly. Into a deep
pan pour oil to a depth of about 1 1/2 inches. Heat oil to 350
degrees. Using chopsticks or a spoon, lift one piece of fruit at a
time from batter and let excess batter drip off, then lower fruit
into hot oil. Cook several pieces at a time until coating is golden
brown (about 2 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on
paper towels. Generously oil a flat serving dish. Fill a serving bowl
to the brim with ice cubes; cover with water. Place sugar, water and
oil in a ten inch frying pan; stir to blend. Place pan over high
heat. When mixture begins to bubble (about one minute), shake pan
continuously to prevent burning.  Continue cooking and shaking pan
until syrup *just* turns a pale straw color (about 9 minutes).
Immediately remove from heat, add sesame seeds, and swirl to mix.
(Syrup will continue to cook after you remove it from heat and color
will turn golden in a few seconds.) Drop fruit into syrup and swirl
to coat evenly. Using two spoons, immediately remove each piece of
fruit and place on oiled dish so pieces do not touch. At table, dip
each piece of fruit in ice water so coating hardens and fruit cools.
Serve.
