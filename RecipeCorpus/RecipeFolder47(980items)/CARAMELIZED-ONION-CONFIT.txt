Title: CARAMELIZED ONION CONFIT
Categories: Condiments, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
6 tb Olive oil
5 tb Butter
15    Onions (about 5 pounds),
-peeled, thinly sliced
4    Bay leaves
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  White wine
When thin slices of onions are cooked very slowly in butter and olive
oil they reduce to a dark, thick consistency much like a marmalade.

Combine the olive oil and butter in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan
over medium heat.  When the butter foams, add half of the sliced
onions and 2 of the bay leaves.  Sprinkle with half of the sugar and
half of the salt.

Add remaining onions, bay leaves, sugar and salt. Cover, reduce heat
to low, and cook for 20 minutes.

Uncover, stir, and increase heat to medium.  Cook for 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

Increase heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until the onions
are a deep golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Add the wine and stir, scraping bottom of pan to dislodge any browned
bits. Cook for 4 or 5 minutes longer. Serve hot or at room
temperature.

Delicious with roast meats or poultry, as well with leftover turkey
sandwiches (try topping with a little cranberry sauce).

Makes about 3 cups.
