Title: CARAMEL SAUCE
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 /2
1/2 c  White sugar
2 tb Water
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Soymilk (must be the full
Fat kind, or use cream)
Mix sugar and water in a pan BEFORE adding heat.  Stir over medium
flame until it begins to brown.  Add cinnamon and soymilk, remove
from flame and stir well. If things harden, return to heat and let it
melt up well. This is actually better over cooked brown rice than it
is over the bread pudding.
