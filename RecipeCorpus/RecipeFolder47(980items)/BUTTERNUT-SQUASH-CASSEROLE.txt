Categories: Casseroles, Holiday, Vegetables
Yield: 10 Servings
2 1/2 lb Butternut squash
-(up to 5 lb)
1    Carrot (2 if use
-more squash)
1 c  Rolled oats
-(uncooked oatmeal)
12 oz Green peas
1 tb Butter
2    Eggs, beaten
-frothy
1 pn Salt
5 tb Cinnamon sugar
-(or less)
1/2 ts Vanilla
Boil squash and carrot together until the carrot is tender. Allow
both to cool.  Slide skin off carrot. Being careful with squash,
remove its seeds and peel. Blend carrots and squash together. Don't
over-blend: preserve some texture. Add cinnamon sugar and salt to
taste.

Add frothy eggs to carrot/squash mixture.  Grease an 8-inch loaf pan.
Coat the grease with oatmeal.  Mix about 1/2 cup oatmeal into
casserole. Gently fold in green peas, then put mixture in casserole
pan. Sprinkle remaining oatmeal on top and dot with butter. Bake at
350 degrees F. 30 to 40 minutes until brown on top. Once cooked, it
can be served immediately or frozen for later consumption.

NOTES:

*  Butternut squash and carrot casserole -- A delicious Thanksgiving
or Christmas casserole.  My mother makes this at the holidays. I
don't know where she originally got the recipe. Yield: Serves 10.

*  Cinnamon sugar is a mixture of sugar and powdered cinnamon.
Commercial cinnamon sugar mixtures are mostly sugar. My mom prepares
her own mixture with the emphasis decidedly on the cinnamon.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  40 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
