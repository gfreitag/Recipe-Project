Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
Yield: 9 Servings
1 lb Dried pinto beans
2 c  Chopped yellow onion
1 c  Chopped green onions
1 c  Chopped green bell pepper
1/2 ts Minced garlic
1/4 ts Red cayenne pepper
3/4 ts Ground black pepper
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Oregano
1/4    Teasppon garlic powder
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
3 ds Tabasco sauce
6 oz Can of tomato paste
1/4 ts Thyme
1 ts Celery flakes
6 c  Cooked brown rice
(This is real good and hot, so you may want to tone down hot spices
and add them last, to taste, if you can't tolerate the spicy heat.)

Wash beans and then soak for 12 hours.  (I never soak beans and never
have any gas unless I eat them with milk.)

Drain water.  Fill a large pot with beans; add water to 1/2 inch above
beans level.  Add remaining ingredients except rice; cook over low
heat 2 to 2 1/2 hours, covered. Serve over cooked brown rice.

I got this recipe from the January 94 issue of Shape magazine, in an
article about the Cooper Clinic (I believe it's in Texas). I didn't
want to post without trying first, So last weekend I tried it and
it's wonderful!
