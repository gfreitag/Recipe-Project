First prepare the peeled and thinly sliced wide ribbons of ginger and

at room temperature for one hour until service.

Prepare court bouillon with large dice of celery, onion, carrot,
lemon, shrimp shells and spices. Add three cups of water and white
wine. Simmer with cover for 30 minutes and strain liquid into 12"
sauce pot; ready for poaching cabrilla. Reserve.

While court bouillon is simmering prepare celery essense by placing
the thyme sprigs, white wine, water, lemon grass and celery bulb
wedges in a 6" heavy gauge sauce pot with lid and slowly braise for
45 minutes. The celery bulb will be tender and a celery essense
liquid will be prepared for the sauce. Adjust taste with salt and
white pepper.

Cabrilla medallions are then poached lightly for 5 minutes in the
court bouillon. Next, blanch the hearts of celery very lightly to
bring out the flavor and color. Reserve court bouillon.

Place the braised celery bulb in the center of plate. Shingle the
poached cabrilla medallion atop towards the base of the plate.
Garnish with heart of celery and place strained carrot and ginger
ribbons above the celery bulb. Serve immediately.
