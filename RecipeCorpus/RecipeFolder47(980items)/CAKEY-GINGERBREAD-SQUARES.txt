Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Holidays
Yield: 12 Servings
1 x  -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
8 tb Unsalted butter; at room
1 x  -temperature
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ea Large eggs
1 x  Grated zest of 1 orange
2 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 c  Unsulfured molasses
1 c  Boiling water
1 x  Confectioners' sugar;
1 x  -for dusting
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9-inch square
baking pan. Using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed, beat
the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat until
light in color and texture, about 2 additional minutes. Beat in the
eggs and orange zest. Sift the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon,
allspice, nutmeg, salt, and cloves onto a piece of waxed paper. In a
2-cup glass measuring cup, combine the molasses and boiling water.
Alternately in thirds, beat in the flour and molasses mixtures.
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick
inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, and the cake is
shrinking from the sides of the pan, 40 to 50 minutes. Let stand on a
wire cake rack for 5 minutes. Place the confectioners' sugar in a
sieve and dust over the top of the cake. Serve the cake warm or
completely cooled.  Makes 12 to 16 servings. Source: "An Edible
