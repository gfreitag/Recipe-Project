adding a significant amount of sodium. Halving the amount to 3/4 tsp.
will subtract 222mg Na PER SERVING! (Combined with low-sodium cheese
the sodium would be now total 377mg per serving.) Substitutuing
low-sodium granules might be even more significant. 4. We prefer more
spinach so I always use two 10-ounce packages of spinach. That adds
17 Kcal and 52mg Na per serving. Nutr. Assoc.
