36    Strawberries
DARK CHOCOLATE COATING:
1/2 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 ts Oil
WHITE CHOCOLATE COATING:

Wash strawberries; gently pat dry.  Line tray with waxed paper. In
small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips and 1 tsp. oil,
stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat. Set saucepan in
pan of hot water to maintain dipping consistency.  Dip 18

side down on paper-lined tray. Refrigerate until serving time.
Repeat with remaining strawberries, using vanilla milk chips and 1
1/2 tsp. oil. Tip: To make pastel-colored coating, add 2 to 5 drops
any food color to melted vanilla milk chip mixture. Typed by
