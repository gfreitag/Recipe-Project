Title: CARAMEL CUSTARD
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
FOR THE CUSTARD:
3    Eggs
3    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Half and half
FOR THE CARAMEL: Heat the oven to 375F. For the caramel, combine the
sugar and water in a small saucepan. Swirl the pan until the sugar is
dissolved, then cover the pan and cook over medium high heat until
thick and large bubbles form. Uncover the pan, and cook until a rich,
brown color. Watch the caramel, since it burns very quickly once it
begins to color. Pour the syrup into the bottom of a mold, and rotate
to cover the bottom and up a few inches of the sides evenly. Set
aside. For the custard, whisk the eggs, yolks and sugar in a mixing
bowl. Heat the vanilla, milk and half and half until hot to the
touch, about 150F. Slowly add this to the egg mixture, and pour into
the prepared mold. Place the mold in a baking pan, and place in the
oven. Pour boiling water into the baking pan so it is half way up the
sides of mold. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until a kniefe inserted
in the center comes out cleam. Cool at room temperature, then
refrigerate and serve chilled. To serve, invert the mold over a
platter with sides to catch the caramel sauce. Note: The custard can
be made up to two days in advance. If made in advance, refrigerate,
covered with plastic wrap.
