Categories: Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pt Double Cream
11 oz Sugar
Finely grated rind and juice
-of two lemons
44    Raspberries
Put the cream, two ounces of the sugar and grated lemon rind in a
saucepan and slowly bring to the boil. Meanwhile pour thr lemon juice
into a large bowl. Pour the hot cream mixture onto the lemon juice,
stirring gently to mix. Cool quickly over crushed ice or in the
refrigerator.

Line four ramekins with clingfilm and arrange six raspberries in the
base of each one. Pour on just enough of the lemon mixture to cover
them. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Pour on the rest of
the lemon mixture and refrigerate for at least two hours, or
preferably over night.

For the caramelised raspberries, dissolve 9 ounces of sugar in 6
tablespoons of water in a heavy based saucepan over a low heat.
Increase the heat and boil rapidly to a golden caramel. Spear the
twenty remaining raspberries on a skewer one at a time and dip into
the caramel turning to coat. Transfer to a baking tray lined with
non-stick baking parchment and leave to cool.

To serve, turn the puddings out on to individual serving plates.
Surround with the caramelised raspberries and some more fresh
rasperries if you like.
