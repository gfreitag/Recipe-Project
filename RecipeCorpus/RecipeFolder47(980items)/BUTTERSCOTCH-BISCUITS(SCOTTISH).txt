Title: BUTTERSCOTCH BISCUITS(SCOTTISH)
Categories: Cakes, Scottish
Yield: 4 Servings
12 oz SR flour
4 oz Margarine
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg, beaten
8 oz Brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla essence
Set oven to 350F or Mark 4. Grease a baking sheet. Melt the sugar,
margarine and vanilla essence together in a saucepan very gently over
a low heat. Remove from the heat. When the mixture has cooled add the
beaten egg and mix together. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
Make a well in the centre and pour in the cooled egg/fat/sugar
mixture. Knead into a stiff dough. This will be fairly dry, but it
needs no extra moisture. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into
1/2 inch thickness and cut out the biscuits with a 2 inch biscuit
cutter. Place on the baking sheet with sufficient space to allow them
to spread. Bake for 20 minutes until light golden in colour.
