This is a hearty sweet and sour meat soup that can be used as a main
dish. Bubbies  measurements were never exact. You need to taste. Put
meat and bones in a 8 or 12 qt stock pot. Put in cans of tomato,
cover with water and bring to a boil. In the meantime, get your
veggies ready. Slice beets and carrots, others go in whole. When
stock boils, skim off top. Put in beets, carrots, garlic, and other
veggies. Turn heat down to a simmer and keep lid on askew. After
about an hour, put in garlic and sugar.
I have used Sweet and Low. Amounts are a matter of preference. It
should have a rich, sweet and sour taste. I break up the meat and
stir it back into the soup before serving. NOTE: Sometimes I add some
tomato paste; 2 or 3 T for body; Enjoy!!! * Elaine/Framingham *
