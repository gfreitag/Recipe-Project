This is from "Betty Crocker's New International Cookbook". According
to the recipe, "No salad is more characteristic of Mexico than Cactus
Salad. Nopal, or prickly pear cactus paddles, are fleshy little
wedges that are delicious tossed with a vinaigrette.  The dressing
above features aromatic cilantro.
Place cactus, tomatoes, onion and cilantro in glass or plastic
bowl. Shake remaining ingredients in tightly covered jar. Pour over
vegetables; toss. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours. Serve on
lettuce leaves if desired.  6 servings.

NOPALES:

The recipe states, "These cacti are not so viciously spined as
many others.  The paddles (leaves) are the edible portion, a great
favorite in Mexican cooking. Called nopalitos, they are boiled and
eaten crisp-tender, dressed in salads, or served tender and hot, as a
cooked vegetable. Their little spines must be removed before cooking.
Look in specialty stores featuring Mexican groceries for cans and
fresh nopalitos." Walt
