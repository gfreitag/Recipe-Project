Title: CARAMELS AU CHOCOLAT (CHOCOLATE CARAMELS)
Categories: Chocolate, Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Milk
13 oz Powdered sugar
Eggsize piece of glucose
3 1/4 oz Chocolate in tablets
1 1/2 oz Butter
1/2    Vanilla bean
Put milk, sugar, vanilla bean and glucose into a stewpan. Put the
chocolate into a round-bottomed copper pan and melt it slowly on the
stove. Meanwhile, heat the mixture in the stewpan, not letting it
boil, since you merely want to melt the sugar and glucose. When
completely melted, pour this mixture, bit by bit, into the chocolate,
while stirring. When thoroughly mixed, cook at moderate heat,
constantly stirring. Cook to the 'ball' stage. (To test the stage of
cooking by finger, dip the thumb and index finger into cold water,
then into the mixture, bringing the 2 fingers together and dipping
them again into water. This should be done quickly to avoid burning.
The mixture forms a ball that can be rolled with the tip of the
fingers.) Remove from the fire, add the butter, mix well, and pour
onto an oiled marble slab in an oiled, iron framework. Let cool and
cut.
