tb Sauce to taste

4 ea To 6 cloves garlic, finely

1. Place the shrimp in a large non-reactive bowl and season liberally
with salt and Tabasco. In a small nonreactive bowl, combine the rum,
lime juice, Worcestershire, and cumin. Add the mixture to the shrimp,
toss to blend, and refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour or until
ready to cook.

2. Preheat the broiler. In a small saucepan over low heat, heat the
butter and oil. When the butter begins to foam, add the garlic, cook,
stirring, 1 to 2 minutes, and set aside.

3. Remove the shrimp from the marinade (discard the marinade),
transfer them to a shallow ovenproof dish that will fit them
comfortably in a single layer or to individual ramekins, and spoon
the garlic sauce evenly over them. Sprinkle the cracker meal on top.

4. Broil 4 inches from the heat source until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
Sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once. Makes 6 to 8 servings
