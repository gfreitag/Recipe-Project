2    Boxes Au Gratin Potatoes
Freddy or Costco is OK
6 c  Water
1/2 c  Dry Milk Powder
1/4 c  Margarine Or Oil

put the corned beef or tuna on the bottom of the pan. open the potato
packages and layer the potatoes on top of the meat. sprinkle the
cheese powder over the potatoes. Put the oil or margarine on the
potatoes. Heat the water to near boiling and add the dry milk. Pour
the hot liquid over the dry potatoes and put the pot on a moderate
fire to simmer gently for 40 minutes. This arrangement should result
in a slightly liquid mixture. Turn the pot from time to time if it is
being kept at the edge of the fire to assure it heat allthe way
around. The oil or margarine is to keep the liquid from foaming. A
smaller quanity or none can be used, but more care to keep the liquid
from boiling over must be made. Good served with something that will
sop up the extra juices.
