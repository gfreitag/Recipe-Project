The addition of butter to this barbecue sauce is quite the culinary
discovery. Once you've experienced this sauce's buttery richness,
you'll make it the specialty of your house.

For sauce, combine butter, horseradish, catsup, vinegar, lemon juice,
Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce in small saucepan. Bring to
boiling, stirring occasionally. (Or, micro-cook on 100% power [high]
1 to 1 1/2 minutes.) Remove from heat; set aside.

Remove skin from chickens, if desired. Rinse chicken; pat dry with
paper towels.

Place the chicken quarters, bone sides up, on grill rack directly over
medium coals. Grill, uncovered, 40 to 50 minutes or until chicken
pieces are tender and no longer pink, turing once after 20 minutes
and brushing frequently with sauce during last 10 minutes of grilling.

Makes 8 servings.
