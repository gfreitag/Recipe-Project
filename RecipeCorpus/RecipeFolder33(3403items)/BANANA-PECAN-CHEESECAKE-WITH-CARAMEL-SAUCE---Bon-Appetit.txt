ahead. Cover and chill. Before using, rewarm over low heat.)

ingredients in processor. Blend until moist clumps form. Press crumbs
onto bottom and 1 inch up sides of prepared pan. Bake 5 minutes; cool.

FOR CAKE: Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in bowl until
smooth. Add sugar, vanilla and 6 T caramel sauce; beat until blended.
Add eggs; beat until smooth. Mix in nuts and cream. Slice 2 bananas
into 1/4-inch-thick rounds; fold into batter. Transfer batter to
crust. Bake cake until top is golden and center is sofdy set, about 1
hour 10 min- utes. Cool on rack. Cover; chill overnight.

Cut around pan sides to loosen cake. Release pan sides. Top cake with
whipped cream and banana slices, if desired. Serve with remaining
sauce.
