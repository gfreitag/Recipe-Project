Title: Dr. Ziment's Garlic Chicken Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 cups
2 cn Low-sodium chicken broth (or
-3 1/2 cups homemade broth)
1    Garlic head, peeled (about
-15 cloves)
1 md Onion, quartered
1 1/2 tb Minced parsley
1 1/2 tb Minced cilantro
1 ts Minced mint
1 ts Minced basil leaves
1 ts Curry powder
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
Salt to taste
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
Put all ingredients except the lemon juice in a saucepan and bring to
a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered or uncovered, for 30 minutes.
(Omit the cover if you wish to inhale teraputic cooking fumes.) In a
blender or food processor, puree the cooked garlic, onions and herbs
with a little liquid and stir back into the soup. Add lemon juice. If
you want a clear broth, filter out the solid constituents. Makes
about 3 1/2 cups.

AN EFFECTIVE DOSE: As little as 1/2 cup, but for a better response,
take 1-2 cups, Ziment says. He advises sipping slowly to get the most
benefits.
