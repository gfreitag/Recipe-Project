Yield: 16 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 c  Cake flour -- sifted
1/4 c  Powdered sugar
4 tb Cream cheese

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3    Egg whites

1 1/2 tb Lemon zest -- grated
2 tb All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder

CRUST: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat an 8-inch square baking pan
with non-stick cooking spray and set aside. In a large bowl, stir
together cake flour and powdered sugar. Using a pastry blender cut
cream cheese into the flour mixture until crumbly. Gradually add oil,
stirring with a fork. Toss until evenly moistened. (The mixture will
be crumbly.) Press into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 20
to 25 minutes, or until golden colored.

FILLING: In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites, sugar and lemon zest
together with an electric mixer until smooth. In a small bowl, stir
together all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt. Add to the
egg-white mixture and beat until blended. Mix in lemon juice. Pour
over the hot crust and bake for about 20 minutes longer, or until the
top is light golden brown and set. Let cool in the pan on a rack.
Spray a sharp knife with non-stick cooking spray and cut into
squares. Dust with sifted powdered sugar.

Yield: About 16 squares.
