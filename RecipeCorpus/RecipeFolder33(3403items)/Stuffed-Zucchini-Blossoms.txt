Title: Stuffed Zucchini Blossoms
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
12    Baby zucchini with flowers
-OR
12    Zucchini flowers AND
1 lg Zucchini
2 oz Prociutto (Italian cured
-ham), diced
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 lb Ricotta cheese
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1    Garlic clove, sliced in half
3 tb Extra virgin olive oil
For the bechamel sauce:
3 tb Butter
1 tb Flour (heaping)
1 1/2 c  Milk
Cut the zucchini into thin slices. (If you're using one large
zucchini, quarter it lengthwise, and then slice.) Heat the oil in a
skillet. Add the garlic and saute until golden. Discard the garlic
and add the zucchini slices to the skillet. Add salt and saute for 10
minutes, until the turn lightly golden. Remove from heat and allow to
cool slightly.

In a bowl, mash the ricotta with a fork. Add half the Parmesan, salt
and pepper to taste, and the prociutto. Add the sauteed zucchini and
mix well.

Make the bechamel sauce: Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and flour in
small pot, stirring the mixture with a whisk. Add the milk and whisk
vigorously. Continue until the mixture starts to boil, but don't let
it boil. Remove from heat. Add remaining Parmesan and salt and pepper
to taste.

Stuff the zucchini flowers with the ricotta mixture. Place the stuffed
flowers in an oven-proof casserole that has been greased with the
remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Pour the bechamel sauce over the
flowers. Bake in a 375'F. oven until top is browned, about 40 minutes.

NOTE: You can also stuff the flowers while they're still attached to
the baby zucchini. Just have one large zucchini on hand to use for the
stuffing. Bake the stuffed flowers, attached to the fruit, as
directed.
