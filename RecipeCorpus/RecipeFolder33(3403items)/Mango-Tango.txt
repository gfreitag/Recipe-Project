MANGO TANGO
===========
Mountains of green, yellow and red-tinged footballs tumble from boxes
in every corner store. Sweet as summer, dripping with juice, the best
place to enjoy them is in the bathtub. They're so cheap right now,
buy a bunch. Mango master Sal Borg of Sanci Tropical Foods in
Kensington Market say he might have 12 varieties on hand any given
day from now to September. Most hail from Mexico and Jamaica. Some
mangos are fibrous inside, others smooth as silk. Haden, Tommy
Atkins, Keitt and Kent are the most common in these parts. India's
Alphonse mango is queen of the spring crop, while the most revered
mid-summer mango is the Imperial. "If you can find an Imperial," says
Borg, "you'll be in mango heaven." Each variety has its own tropical
taste, so experiment. You'll find the name on the box, or ask your
produce manager. To pick a mango, look for taut skin and a sweet
smell. Leave on the counter until slightly soft when pressed, then
refrigerate until use. Puree ripe mangoes into milkshakes, slice over
ice cream or cube and gently fold (at the last minute) into fruit or
chicken salad. Or chop for salsa. Thai cooks garte hard, unripe
mangoes into tart salads, and serve ripe mango slices with sticky
rice and coconut milk for breakfast. But the best way to eat mango is
to stand over the sink and eat the whole thing. As golden juice runs
down your arm, close your eyes and think summer sunshine all year
round.

HOW TO PEEL A MANGO: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Place unpeeled mango upright with narrow end toward you. With a
sharp knife, slice gently down one "cheek" following the line of the
pit. DON'T SLICE INTO THE PIT! Repeat with second cheek. Cut
remaining flesh in strips and peel.

2. Score each cheek deeply in a cross-hatch pattern, cutting down to
but not through the skin. Cut large squares for fruit salad; small
squares for salsa.

3. Push cheeks skin-side up and inside out so the fruit pops up like a
porcupine. With knife, cut cubes from peel and use in recipes. Or
serve cut mango halves for breakfast or dessert. Recipes to folow in
subsequent messages.
