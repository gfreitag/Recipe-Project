Heat 2 T olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add half of
button mushrooms, half of shiitake mushrooms, garlic, shallots and
thyme and saute until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add 2/3 C white
wine and simmer until mushrooms are tender and almost all liquid
evaporates, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
(Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room
temperature.)

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but
still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, add remaining mushrooms and remaining 1/3 C wine to cooked
mushroom mixture in skillet. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer
just until mushrooms are slightly limp, about 3 minutes. Mix in
stock, green onions and parsley. Set aside. Heat remaining 1 T oil in
heavy small skillet over high heat. Add lamb and cook to desired
doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Cut lamb
diagonally into slices.

Drain pasta and divide between plates. Spoon mushroom mixture and
juices over. Top with lamb and bell pepper. Serve, passing cheese
separately.
