Title: Southwest Honey Barbecue Spareribs
Categories: Bbq/grill, Main dish
Yield: 24 servings
3 c  Honey
2 1/4 qt Canned tomatoes in puree
1 1/2    Cider vinegar
Hot pepper sauce
1 tb Dry mustard
24 lb Pork sparerib
2 qt Onion
8 oz Lemon
8    Garlic
1 tb Thyme
4    Bay leaf
Sweet cherry peppers
Romaine lettuce leaves
Honey Barbecue Sauce: Combine honey, tomatoes, vinegar, hot pepper
sauce and mustard in food processor. Process just until blended, so
small chunks of tomato are visible. Set aside.

Place spareribs in greased pan and bake in 325 degree F oven 20
minutes or until lightly browned. Pour off any excess fat. Add onion
and lemon slices, garlic, thyme and bay leaves.  Pour barbecue sauce
over spareribs and continue baking 1 hour, basting often until ribs
are tender.  Remove bay leaves and hold warm for service.

Cut spareribs into serving size pieces; arrange on serving plate and
top with barbecue sauce.  Garnish with peppers on crisp romaine
lettuce leaves. Submitted By DAN KLEPACH   On   08-14-95
