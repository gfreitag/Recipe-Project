Brine salmon chunks 8 or more hours, keeping refrigerated. (I do them
overnight.)  Fill flavour pan with hickory, alder or mix 2/3 apple
with 1/3 cherry.  Use 2 to 3 panfuls.  Leave in the smoker until
drying is completed.  This may take 12 hours, depending on the
thickness of the meat. Place largest and thickest chunks on the
bottom rack.

I also can my salmon in the 1/2 pt jars after I have smoked it or I
freeze it.
