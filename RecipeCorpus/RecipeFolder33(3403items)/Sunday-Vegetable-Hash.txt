This veggie hash is different than most you've had, as it is not
supposed to form a large, heavy pancake. It is a fresh and lively
approach to an old standby.

1. Peel and cut turnip and potato into 1/4" dice. Place in a pot with
water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until just tender. Drain and
remove to a bowl.

2. Pour vegetable broth into a large, non-stick skillet. Add diced
onion and peppers; cook over medium heat, stirring, for 4-5 minutes.
Add corn and cook for 1 minute. Add to the turnip and potato mixture.
Toss with thyme, salt, pepper and 3 tablespoons parsley.

3. Coat skillet with olive-oil spray. Add vegetables abd weigh down
with a heavy lid, slightly smaller than the skillet. Cook over medium
heat for 5-7 minutes, or until bottom is slightly golden. Turn hash
over with a spatula, spraying the skillet with more oil; cook for 3
minutes longer, or until hash is golden.

4. Remove hash to a platter. Sprinkle with remaining parsley. Serve
topped with poached eggs, if desired.
