Title: Acorn Squash Stuffed with Chorizo and Corn
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Sausage
Yield: 4 servings
4    Acorn squash, each approx.
-4" in diameter
1/2 lb Mexican chorizo sausages,
-casings removed
1 c  Cooked basmati or long-
-grain white rice
1 c  Fresh corn kernels (or
-frozen corn, thawed)
4    Green onions, green parts
-only, coarsely chopped
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped pimiento-
-stuffed green olives (opt)
1/4 c  Chicken stock, preferably
-homemade, or water
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
-to taste
3/4 c  Grated Monterey Jack
Preheat the oven to 350'F.

Cut a thin slice off the bottom of each squash, removing just enough
that it will stand upright. Then slice off the tops (no more than 1"
thick) and scrape out the seeds. Set aside.

In a small skillet, crumble the sausage and place over medium heat.
Fry, stirring frequently, approximately 10 minutes, or until browned.
Transfer to a mixing bowl, along with any fat in the pan. Add the
rice, corn, green onions, optional olives and stock. Mix well, then
season with salt and pepper if needed. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese.

Pack the mixture into the cavities of the prepared squash. Set the
filled squash upright in a 9x13" baking dish and add hot water to the
dish to a depth of approximately 1". Cover loosely. Bake in the oven
for 30-45 minutes, depending on the size of squash. Bake for 10-15
longer, or until the squash can be easily pierced with a fork and the
cheese is melted. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
