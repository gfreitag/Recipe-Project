Title: Burritos Con Huevos
Categories: Tex/mexican, Sandwich, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 lb Flank steak -- * see note
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Seasoned salt
2 c  Hot water
3    Yellow onions
1 lg Bell pepper
1    Jalapeno pepper -- chopped
2    Tomatoes -- peeled and
Chopped
10 lg Eggs
2 c  Cheddar cheese -- shredded
8    Flour tortillas
* Use another cut of meat if flank steak is unavailable.

1. To prepare steak, cut into 3-4 pieces and sprinkle with the salt
and pepper. Heat a very heavy pan with tight fitting lid. Add 1
tablespoon oil and brown the meat on each side. 2. Add hot water and
cover tightly. Simmer on low heat for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or until meat
shreds easily. Add more water during cooking if necessary. When meat
is tender, shred into small bite-sized pieces. 3. Cut the onions into
thin slices and separate the slices into individual rings. Julienne
the green pepper. Mince the jalapeno pepper (use a canned one if
necessary). 4. In a large heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil; add
the onions and green peppers. Saute until onions are translucent and
limp. Add the chopped fresh tomato and the minced jalapeno and
continue cooking for 3 minutes more. 5. Add the shredded meat, 10
eggs which have been lightly beaten, and the shredded cheese. Proceed
as though you were scrambling eggs. 6. Warm the flour tortillas while
cooking the filling, or quickly run each tortilla over the flame on a
gas stove, just to soften. Fill each tortilla with 1/8th of the
mixture. Roll the tortillas by turning one side up and folding the
edges inward. Wrap the lower third in foil or waxed paper and serve
immediately.
