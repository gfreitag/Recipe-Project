MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
16 oz Walnuts chopped finely
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Rosewater
3 tb Orange flower water
1/4 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
1 pk Filo pastry
1/2 c  Melted ghee

3 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
3 dr Orange flower water

To make the filling:  Combine all of the filling ingredients.

To make the baklava:  Remove the pastry from the package and unfold to
reveal flat sheets.  Cut the sheets in half and place the pastry
between 2 barely damp tea towels to prevent it from drying out. Take
one half sheet of pastry at a time and place it on a workbench.
Brush the pastry sparingly with melted ghee, fold it in half
lengthwise and brush again. Place 1 tbsp of the filling at one short
edge of the pastry, fold in the sides to enclose the filling and roll
up in a finger shape.  Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.
Place the baklava rolls on a greased baking tray and bake in a
preheated 350 degree F. oven until they are golden.

To make the syrup:  Combine all the ingredients and boil until the
mixture has a syrup consistency. To finish: pour the syrup over the
cooked rolls and allow to stand until cool.
