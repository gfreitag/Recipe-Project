White vinegar
Fresh chili -- sliced
1 pn Salt
(Thai Vinegar with Chili) To make the nam som prik dong (vinegar with
chili), start out by using a glass or plastic jar with plastic lid,
never metal (peanut butter jar works well for me). Put one part
sliced fresh chili and 2 parts white viengar and a pinch of salt in
the jar. Stir to mix well and that's it. Keep in the fridge or at
room temperature up to 3 months. You can make nam som prik thum the
same way but puree the chilies in the blender first.
