Title: Three-Fruit Preserves
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
5    1/2-pint canning jars
14 oz Pineapple chunks in juice --
1    Can
4 c  Cranberries -- 1 pound
2 c  Pears -- diced
2 c  Sugar
* Wash and sterilize jars.

1. Drain pineapple, reserving syrup. Wash and drain cranberries. Wash
pears; cut in half, core, peel and dice enough to yield about 2 cups.
Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice evenly over pears. 2. Put 2
cups sugar and 1/2 cup water into heavy 3-quart saucepan with
tight-fitting lid. Place over medium heat and stir until sugar is
dissolved. Bring to a boil, cover, and boil 5 minutes. Uncover; add
the cranberries and cook until cranberry skin pops. Add the diced
pears with the syrup that was sprinkled on them, and the pineapple
tidbits. Continue cooking until thick; about 20 minutes. Remove from
heat and skim to remove any foam. 3. Immediately fill sterilized and
drained jars; seal tightly.

Yield: About five 1/2 pint jars.
