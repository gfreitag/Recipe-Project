Title: Creamiest Rice Custard Cream
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Rice
2 c  Milk
2    Egg yolks -- well beaten
3 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla extract
2    Egg whites
3 tb Sugar
1. Cook rice and milk together over boiling water until tender and
rice has absorbed all of milk, about 1 hour. Will need to check and
stir occasionally to keep from sticking and make sure water in double
boiler stays at a simmer. 2. Into beaten egg yolks stir 3 tablespoons
sugar and salt; stir in some of the hot rice mixture. Return to
double boiler and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Cool
partially. Stir in vanilla. 3. Beat egg whites until frothy, then add
in 2-3 tablespoons sugar a little at a time. Beat until stiff and
glossy. Gently fold into rice mixture.

Chill before serving. Recipe can be doubled but must be watched
carefully to be sure it cooks correctly and does not burn.
