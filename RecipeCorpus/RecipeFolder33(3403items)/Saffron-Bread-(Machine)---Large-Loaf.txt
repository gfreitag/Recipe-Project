Saffron is the world's most expensive spice - 225,000 crocus stigmas
are needed to make a single pound!  The texture and flavor of this
light and fluffy loaf will convince you it's worth it.  This is bread
for a special occasion - or bread that will make any occasion
special. The distinctive old world flavor works majic with seafood
and hearty soups like lentil or sausage.

Success Hints
-------------

If using saffron threads, grind to a coarse powder-like consistency
using a mortar and pestle.  The fresh powder will be more potent than
the pre-ground so you'll need less.

Once opened, the intensity of a vial of saffron will diminish.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
