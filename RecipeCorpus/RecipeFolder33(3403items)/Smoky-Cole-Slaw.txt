Soak hickory chips in cold water at least 15 minutes.  Drain well.

In 3-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, whisk together horseradish,
cider vinegar, mayonnaise and scallions.  Season with salt and
pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.

Prepare grill.  When coals have reached a mellow or medium-low heat,
sprinkle them with drained hickory chips.  Arrange vegetables on grill
rack.  When hickory chips begin smoking, cover grill and smoke
vegetables for 15 to 20 minutes.

Remove vegetables from grill and cool to room temperature.  (If
making in advance; prepare to this point, then refrigerate.  Allow
vegetables to return to room temperature before proceeding).  Grate
vegetables in food processor fitted with medium grating disk.

Add grated vegetables to mayonnaise dressing.  Season with salt and
pepper and combine thoroughly.  Serve immediately.  Slaw can be
covered tightly and stored in refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.

Makes 4 cups.
