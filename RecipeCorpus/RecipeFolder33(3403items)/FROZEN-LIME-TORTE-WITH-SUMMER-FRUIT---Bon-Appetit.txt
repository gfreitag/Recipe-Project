NUT CRUST: Finely chop first 4 ingredients in processor, using on/off
turns. Add butter and blend until moist crumbs form. Transfer 3 1/2 C
nut mixture to 10 inch-diameter springform pan with 2 1/2 inch-high
sides; transfer remaining nut mixture to 6-inch-diameter springform
pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides.* Using plastic wrap as aid, press
crumbs firmly up sides, then over bottom of each pan, covering
completely. Freeze.

*Springform pans are available at some cake supply stores and by mail
from Jane's Cakes and Chocolates, 2331 Honolulu Avenue, Montrose, CA
91020; 818957-2511 or 800-262-7630.

LIME FILLING: Combine first 5 ingredients in medium metal bowl. Place
bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to
touch water). Whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers
170"F, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Add white
chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Freeze time mixture
until cold and thickened, whisking occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Beat cream in large bowl until stiff. Pour lime mixture over whipped
cream; using rubber spatula, fold lime mixture and cream together.
Divide filling between crusts. Cover and freeze overnight.

BLACKBERRY SAUCE: Bring all ingredients to boil in heavy medium
saucepan, stirring frequently. Cool slightly. Puree mixture in
batches in processor. Strain through sieve set over bowl, pressing on
solids. Chill until cold. (Can be made 1 day ahead.)

ASSEMBLY: Using electric mixer, beat cream and sugar in large bowl
until peaks form. Run sharp knife around pan sides to loosen torte
tiers. Release pan sides. Center 6 inch tier on its pan bottom atop
10 inch tier. Spread whipped cream over sides (not tops) of tiers,
covering crusts completely. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. (Can
be prepared 2 days ahead. Wrap in plastic, keep frozen.)

Transfer tiered torte to platter. Mound fruit decoratively atop torte.
Garnish with mint. To serve, slide spatula under 6-inch tier and
transfer to work surface. Cut tiers into wedges. Serve with sauce and
additional fruit.
