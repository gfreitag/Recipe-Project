FOR CAKE: Preheat oven to 350'F. Butter two 9-inch diameter
springform pans with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Line pans with parchment.
Butter parchment. Melt chocolate and butter in heavy large saucepan
over low heat, stirring constantly until smooth. Whisk yolks and both
sugars in large bowl. Whisk in warm chocolate mixture. Mix in flour
and nuts.

Using electric mixer, beat whites and cream of tartar in another
large bowl to soft peaks. Gently fold whites into batter in several
additions. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans. Bake until
cakes rise and crack on top and toothpick inserted into center comes
out with some thick batter still attached, about 45 minutes. Cool
cakes completely in pans on racks. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.
Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

FOR FROSTING: Stir all ingredients in heavy large saucepan over low
heat until chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth.
Refrigerate jus until firm enough to spread, whisking occasionally,
about 1 hour.

Release pan sides from cakes. Turn out cakes; peel off parchment.
Place 1 cake layer on platter. Spread 1/2 C frosting over. Top with
second cake layer. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of
cake.
