Categories: Bon appetit, Breads
Yield: 1 large roun
2 c  Warm water (105F to 115F)
2    Envelopes dry yeast
2 c  (or more) all purpose flour
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 tb Fresh chopped rosemary OR
1 ts Dried
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Olive oil
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
Mix 2 C warm water and yeast in large bowl of electric mixer fitted
with dough hook; let stand until yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes. In
medium bowl combine 2 C all purpose flour, whole wheat flour,
rosemary and salt. Stir 1 T oil into yeast mixture. Gradually add
flour mixture and beat until incorporated. Mix on medium speed 10
minutes, adding more all purpose flour if dough is sticky.

Turn out dough onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic,
about 3 minutes. Place dough in lightly oiled large bowl; turn to
coat. Cover with plastic, then kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm
draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/4 hours.

Meanwhile, heat 1 T oil and garlic in small skillet over medium heat 1
minute; stir in nuts and pepper. Remove from heat; cool. Discard
garlic.

Preheat oven to 375'F. Punch down dough; let rest 10 minutes. Turn out
dough onto floured surface. RoU out dough to 12-inch diameter round.
Spread walnut mixture over. Fold dough over walnut mixture; knead 3
minutes to distribute walnuts evenly. Form dough into ball. Place
smooth side up on heavy large baking sheet. Cover with towel; let
rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled, about 35 minutes.

Bake until bread is golden and sounds hollow when tapped on bottom,
about 45 minutes. Cool on rack. (Can be made up to 2 weeks ahead.
Wrap tightly and freeze.)
