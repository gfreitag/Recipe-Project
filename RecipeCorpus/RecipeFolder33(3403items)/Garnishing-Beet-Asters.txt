1. To make the beet aster, selected a well-rounded, medium sized beet
and cut off the top and root end of the vegetable to creat a flat
surface.

2. Peel the beet completely.

3. With the knife, make a series of parallel cuts.  Start these cuts
from the stem end and slice all the way to, but not through, the root
end of the vegetable. Stop the cut about 1/4 inch from the root end.
Cut the slices as close together as possible.

4. When you have completed this series of cuts, give the beet a
quarter turn and cut a second set of parallel cuts across the first
cuts forming right angles.

5. Chill the vegetable in ice water and when ready to use, gently
spread the petals for form the aster.

** NOTE ** To make a mixed bouquet of asters, use white turnips and
follow the same instructions for making the beet asters.  The turnip
asters can be colored by placing a few drops of vegetable food
coloring in the ice water to tint the flowers in a variety of colors.
