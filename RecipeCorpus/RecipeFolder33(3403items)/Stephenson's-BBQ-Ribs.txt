Serving Size:12 Cooking time:3 hrs

*  Available in bulk at most good butcher shops. ** Hotter than
regular mustard.

Let the coals burn almost white prior to cooking the ribs.

Mix seasoning together on a large plate.  Starting at one end, cut
between each rib till almost through.  Lay each slab in the seasoning
mixture, pressing as much of it as you can into the ribs.  Flip the
slab over and repeat on the other side.

Lay ribs on the smoker or grill.  Let them cook for 15 min over
indirect heat.  Keep grill covered.  Then turn and cook 15 min on the
other side. Then turn them over again for 15 min....cooking till the
ribs pull apart easily.  This will be about 2 1/2 hours at 225
degrees. (Use a thermometer to maintain tempurature adding coals as
needed.)

Combine all of the sauce ingredients.  Heat and serve with the meat.

This recipe is from the book "The all American BBQ Book" by Rich
Davis and Shifra Stien. (Vintage Stien Press, 1988).
