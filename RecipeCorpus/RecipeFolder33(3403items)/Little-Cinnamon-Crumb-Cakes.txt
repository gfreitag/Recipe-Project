Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare pan(s)with cooking spray and flour.  To
make crumbs, work the margarine, 1 cup flour, 2/3 cup sugar, and
cinnamon in a small bowl with pastry blender until the mixture forms
crumbs; set aside. To make the batter, combine flour, sugar, baking
powder, and salt in mixing bowl.  In another mixing bowl, combine
applesauce, milk, egg whites, and vanilla.  Mix dry ingredients with
wet ingredients just until moistened. Divide the batter between the
prepared pan(s).  Scatter the crumbs over the tops, pressing them in
gently.  Bake for 40 minutes or until the tops are golden and springy
to the touch.  If the cakes have overflowed a bit, cut them apart
with a sharp knife.
