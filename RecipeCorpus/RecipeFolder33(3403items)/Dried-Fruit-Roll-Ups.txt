* For each cup of fruit you will need 1-1/2 tablespoons of sugar.

1. Chop peaches, nectarines or plums very fine, being careful to
reserve the juice. Place fruit and its juices in saucepan and bring
to a boil. Boil until candy thermometer reads 180 degrees. Cool
slightly. Put into blender and mix until smooth. 2. Return to heat
and cook until the mixture has theconsistency of a thick paste and is
reduced by half. 3. Spread fruit 1/4-inch thick on plastic-wrapped
trays or cookie sheets. Cover pans with a cheesecloth screen, taking
care to keep the cheesecloth from touching fruit. 4. Place in direct
sunlight for 12 to 24 hours until dry (bring in at nighttime). You
can also bake in a 250-degree oven for about 4 hours. Put the fruit
on a lightly greased cookie sheet or use foil to line tray. 5. Fruit
rollups are done when edges pull back from plastic and center is not
sticky when cooled. Ten cups of fruit will cover a 12 x 17-inch tray.
