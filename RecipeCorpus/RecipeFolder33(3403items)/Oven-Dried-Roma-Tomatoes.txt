Title: Oven-Dried Roma Tomatoes
Categories: Tomatoes, Can/preserv
Yield: 8 servings
4 lb Ripe roma tomatoes
1 tb Sea salt
1 ts Fresh ground white pepper
16 oz Extra-virgin olive oil
-(enough to cover the
-tomatoes)
1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves
4    Garlic cloves, whole
Turn your oven to its lowest setting (somewhere in the 140'F. range).
Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and place a baking rack on
top of the foil. Slice tomatoes lengthwise, cut off bottoms, and lay
slices on rack, cut side up. Sprinkle with salt and white pepper and
place them in the oven.

The first time you make the tomatoes, check on them every two hours
or so. (Oven temperatures vary; I usually let my tomatoes dry
overnight.) They are done when most of the detectable moisture is
gone, and the golden wrinkles form all over the tomato. (If they
become brownish-red, they are burnt.)

Remove them from the oven and place them in a jar with the garlic and
fresh basil leaves. Fill the jar with olive oil.
