Categories: Bon appetit, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Sugar
6 lg Egg yolks
1/3 c  Water
1/3 c  Grand Marnier or other
-orange liqueur
2 c  Chilled whipping cream
Orange peel strips (opt.)
Cut parchment paper into six 3 1/2 x 13 inch strips. Wrap 1 strip
around edge of each of six 3/4-C souffle dishes or ramekins, creating
a collar that stands above the rim. Secure with tape. Combine sugar,
yolks and water in medium metal bowl and whisk to blend. Set bowl
over large saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl
touch water). Whisk egg mixture constantly until thermometer
registers 160'F, about 10 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using
electric mixer, beat egg mixture until cool and slightly thick, about
4 minutes. Beat in Grand Marnier. Using electric mixer, whip cream in
large bowl to soft peaks. Fold cream into egg mixture. Divide mixrure
equally among prepared souffle dishes. Freeze overnight. (Can be made
2 days ahead. Cover; keep in freezer.)

Carefully remove collars from souffle dishes. Garnish souffles with
orange peel strips, if desired.
