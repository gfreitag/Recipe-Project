Apple Butter 11 to 13 hours

The big advantage in making preserve butters in a slow cooker is that
you don't have to stir or stand over the pot waiting to stir. Adapt
your favorite fruit butter recipes to fit the instructions and
cooking time.

To Cook: Place the cider and the apples in the slow cooker. Cover and
cook on Low for 10 to 12 hours; do not stir. Rub the apples through a
sieve; measure the apples and add as much sugar as there is apple.
Add the spices and salt and return to the cooker. Cover, and cook on
Low for another hour. Pour into clean, dry, 1/2-pint canning jars.
Seal and process in a boiling-water bath or store in refrigerator.
Makes 4 to 6 pints.
