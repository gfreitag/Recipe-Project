Title: Seviyan (Sweet Vermicelli)
Categories: Desserts, Indian
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 tb Ghee
125 g  Fine vermicelli
1 1/2 c  Hot water
1/4 ts Saffron strands
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Sultanas
2 tb Slivered blanched almonds
1/8 ts Ground cardamom
Break the vermicelli into small pieces less than 2.5cm (1 inch) in
length. They need not be uniform, but longer pieces make stirring
difficult.

Heat ghee in a heavy saucepan and fry the vermicelli intil golden
brown, stirring so it colours evenly. Add hot water and saffron and
bring to the boil, then turn heat low, cover and simmer gently until
vermicelli is cooked. Add sugar and sultanas and cook uncovered until
liquid is absorbed. Stir in the almonds and cardamom, stir well and
serve warm with cream.
