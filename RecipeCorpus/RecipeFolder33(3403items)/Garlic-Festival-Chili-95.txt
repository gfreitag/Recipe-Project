The day before serving, in a Dutch oven over high heat, brown pork
until crispy and as much fat as possible has been rendered.  Remove
pork with slotted spoon.  Drain in a colander lined with paper
towels.  Leave 1/4 cup drippings in Dutch oven;  refrigerate
remainder of fat.

In the fat, over medium-low heat, saute onion, garlic and jalapeno
peppers until soft, about 10 minutes.  Stir in brown sugar.  Cook a
few more minutes. Remove from heat, stir in tomatoes, molasses and
melted chocolate. Stir in spices and reserved pork. Refrigerate
overnight.

The next day:  Heat refrigerated mixture over low heat.   Remove
solidified drippings from refrigerator and remove top layer of fat.
Add bottom dripping layer to chili mixture. Stir in beer, boiling
water, red wine or vinegar, soy sauce and salt. Bring to a boil,
stirring frequently. Reduce heat, cover, simmer and stir occasionally
until meat is very tender and flavors marry, about 1.5 hours. Stir in
habanero sauce to taste. Simmer, covered, 1/2 hour longer. Garnish
with sour cream and cilantro.
