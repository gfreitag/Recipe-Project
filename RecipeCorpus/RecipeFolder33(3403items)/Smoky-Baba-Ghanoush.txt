Title: Smoky Baba Ghanoush
Categories: Dress/stuff
Yield: 2 cups
2 md Eggplants
3    Garlic cloves, coarsely
-chopped
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Tahini *
4 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ts Pepper
Wash eggplants and, with a fork, prick them in about 5 different
spots. Grill whole eggplants over medium-hot coals. Turn about every
5 minutes to even char the skin of the eggplants. Grill until just
soft and charred all over, about 20 minutes. Cool. Cut in half and
scoop out the insides (you may find it easier to peel the skin off
with your fingers if the eggplant gets too mushy).

In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the eggplant,
garlic, salt, sugar, tahini, lemon juice and pepper. Puree until
smooth. If mixture seems too thick, add a little water to achieve
desired consistency. Adjust seasoning.

* This paste made from sesame seeds is available at most grocery
stores.
