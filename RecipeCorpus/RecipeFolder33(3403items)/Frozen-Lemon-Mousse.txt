Categories: Desserts
Yield: 10 servings
1 cn Evaporated milk -- large
Can
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 1/2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
Pour milk into stainless steel mixing bowl and freeze until ice
crystals form around edges (it's very important that the milk is cold
enough for the crystals to form). Whip milk until very stiff. Beat in
sugar and lemon juice gradually. Line two 10-inch cake pans with half
the crumbs. Pour in lemon mixture and top with remaining crumbs.
Freeze for several hours.
