room temperature.)

Lightly toast (or grill) sourdough bread. Spread 1 side of each piece
of bread generously with Indian Spiced Mayonnaise. Slice chicken
breasts diagonally. Place slices of 1 breast atop each of 6 sourdough
bread slices. Top with remaining bread slices. Cut chicken sandwiches
in half. Serve sandwiches warm or at room temperature.
