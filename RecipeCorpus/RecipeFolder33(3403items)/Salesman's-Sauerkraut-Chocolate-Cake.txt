6 oz Chocolate chips
4 tb Margarine
1/2 c  Sour cream

* Use an 8-ounce can of sauerkraut. Do not use sauerkraut which has
caraway seeds. Lightly drain and chop by hand -- don't use food
processor.

1. Combine margarine and sugar in large bowl. Beat in eggs one at a
time. Add the vanilla and blend. 2. In another bowl, sift dry
ingredients together. Add to the egg mixture slowly, alternating with
the water. Stir in the sauerkraut. Mix until smooth. 3. Grease a 13 x
9 x 2-inch pan. Pour the cake batter into pan and bake in preheated
350-degree oven for 30-35 minutes, or until knife inserted in center
comes out clean. If you prefer, leave the cake in the pan for easier
frosting and transporting.

FROSTING: 1. Melt chocolate chips and margarine in top of double
boiler. Remove from heat and add sour cream, vanilla and salt.
Gradually beat in powdered sugar until the frosting is of spreading
consistency. You may not need all the powdered sugar. 2. Frost cake
while still slightly warm or wait until cooled.
