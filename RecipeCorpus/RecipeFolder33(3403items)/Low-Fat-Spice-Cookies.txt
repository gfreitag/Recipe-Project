Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 50 servings
1 3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Brown sugar -- packed
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Margarine -- softened
1/4 c  Fat-free spread -- softened
1    Egg white -- whipped
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Fat-free sour cream
Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare baking sheets with cooking spray.  In a
mixing bowl, combine flours, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves,
baking soda, and salt.  In another mixing bowl, combine margarine,
spread, egg white, vanilla, and sour cream.  Mix dry ingredients with
wet ingredients just until moistened.  Cover and chill overnight.  On
a heavily floured surface (dough will be slightly sticky that's why
more flour is needed), roll dough 1/8" thickness.  Using a 2 1/2 "
cutters, cut dough into desired shapes.  Arrange 1" apart on prepared
baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes and until lightly browned.
