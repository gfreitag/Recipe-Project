Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
3 lg Eggs
1 c  Sugar
2 c  Applesauce
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Salt
Powdered sugar
1 qt Vanilla ice cream
* Have ice cream slightly softened. Use only a very good quality
applesauce that is not too thin.

1. Line a greased 15 x 10 x 1-inch jelly-roll pan with waxed paper;
grease paper.

2. Place eggs in a mixing bowl; beat at high speed for 5 minutes.
Gradually beat in sugar and 1/2 cup applesauce.

3. Sift flour, baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg and salt
together. Blend flour mixture into egg mixture, using low speed.
Spread batter in pan.

4. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 15 minutes or until cake is
lightly browned and springs back when pressed gently. Sprinkle kitchen
towel with powdered sugar; immediately invert cake onto towel.

5. Remove waxed paper; roll cake and towel together from narrow end.
Let cake completely cool.

6. Unroll cake, trimming edges if desired. Remove from towel and
spread with softened ice cream; re-roll. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap
or foil and freeze.

7. Blend remaining 1-1/2 cups applesauce and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.
Chill. When ready to serve, cut roll into slices and top each slice
with chilled applesauce. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
