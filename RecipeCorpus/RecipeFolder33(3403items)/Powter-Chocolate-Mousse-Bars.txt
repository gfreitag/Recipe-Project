Title: Powter Chocolate Mousse Bars
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 16 servings
2/3 c  Flour
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 oz Unsweetened baking chocolate
1 tb Canola oil
6    Extra large egg whites
1 1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Unsweetened applesauce
1/2 c  Plain nonfat yogurt
1 ts Vanilla extract
Preheat oven to 350.  Spray 9x9 inch baking pan with oil and wipe of
excess, or use nonstick pan.

Sift together flour and cocoa powder.  Set aside.

Melt chocolate in double boiler.  When melted, turn off heat and add
oil. Mix until combined. Cool slightly.

Beat egg whites on high with sugar until very fluffy.  Add applesauce,
yogurt, vanilla extract, melted chocolate, and dry ingredients.  Lower
speed and continue beating until well incorporated.

Pour mixture into baking pan and bake for 20-25 mins.  The center of
the mixture will feel firm and not liquidy when touched lightly.  A
toothpick inserted will come out covered with batter, not clean.

Cool and serve chilled.  Cut into 16 bars.
