and cut into bite-sized pieces. Sweeten the pieces to taste with the
sugar. Mix in the rum or rum flavoring. Put mixture back into shell

SAUCE: Scald the light cream (or half-and half); cool slightly. Add
the salt, sugar beaten with 1 whole egg and 2 egg yolks, cornstarch
and vanilla. Cook in double boiler over simmering water, stirring
constantly, until smooth and slightly thickened. Chill.
