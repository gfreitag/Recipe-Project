Title: Arugula, Grilled Lamb and Lima Bean Salad
Categories: Newspaper, Meats, Salads
Yield: 4 servings
2    Red bell peppers
3/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Garlic; minced
1/4 c  Basil; finely chopped
Salt & pepper to taste
1 c  Lima beans; shelled
1 lb Lamb; 1/2" cubes
1 bn Arugula; washed & dried
1 lg Tomato; diced large
1.  Grill the peppers over a hot fire, rolling them around to cook
evenly, until the skin is very dark and blistered.  Remove from the
grill, pop into a brown paper bag, tie the bag shut and allow the
peppers to cool in the bag 20 minutes.  Remove from the bag, peel off
the skin and remove the seeds and stems.

2.  Place the peppers in a food processor or blender, and puree. With
the motor still running, add the olive oil in a steady stream. Add
the balsamic vinegar, garlic and basil and then pulse to blend.
Season with salt and pepper, then set aside.

3.  In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of salted water to a boil. Add
the lima beans, and cook until they are tender but not mushy, 12 to
15 minutes. Drain, plunge into cold water to stop the cooking, drain
again and place in a large bowl.  (If using peas, cook only 2 to 3
minutes, until bright green and tender.)

4.  Meanwhile, season the lamb with salt and pepper to taste, thread
onto skewers and grill over a hot fire 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
(The lamb should still be pink inside.)  Remove from the heat, and
slide off the skewers.

5.  Add the lamb, arugula and tomato to the bowl containing the lima
beans. Stir the dressing very well, add just enough to moisten the
ingredients, toss well and serve.
