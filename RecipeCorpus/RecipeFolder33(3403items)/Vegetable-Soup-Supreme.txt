1. Fit slicing disk into work bowl. Slice each vegetable separately.
Slice onion, carrots, celery, zucchini and tomatoes. 2. Heat olive
oil in a large saucepan. Using medium heat, saute onion until tender.
Add 4 cups water and sliced vegetables. Bring to a simmer and cook
until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 10-12 minutes. 3. Add salt,
green beans which have been thawed, spaghetti and well-drained kidney
beans. Bring to a simmer and cook 10 minutes longer. 4. Prepare
cheese mixture which follows, and stir into soup.

Red Cheese Sauce: Cut Parmesan into 1-inch cubes. Fit the steel knife
blade into a clean work bowl. Process cheese until chopped into
1/8-inch pieces. Measure 1/4 cup cheese and set remaining cheese
aside. Still using the steel blade, combine garlic, salt, olive oil,
tomato paste and 1/4 cup chopped cheese in the bowl. Process to a
smooth paste.
