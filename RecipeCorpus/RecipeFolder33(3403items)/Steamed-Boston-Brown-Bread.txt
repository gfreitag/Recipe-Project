Title: Steamed Boston Brown Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Rye flour
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
3/4 c  Dark molasses
2 c  Buttermilk
3/4 c  Seedless raisins --
Optional
* Measure the flours carefully -- don't pack down in the cup.

Mix the flours, cornmeal, soda, and salt to blend well. Add the
raisins if desired. Mix the milk and molasses to blend and then add
to the flour mixture. Mix well. Grease and lightly flour a 2 quart
heat-proof mold. Fill the mold no more than two-thirds full. Cover
tightly, either with parchment paper or aluminum foil tied tightly
with twine or unwaxed dental floss. Set mold onto rack in large heavy
pan or kettle with lid. Pour boiling water half way up mold. Cover
tightly and steam for about 3-1/2 hours on top of stove. Check the
water level occasionally and keep it at a boiling midpoint level if
possible. When done, take off parchment or foil cover carefully,
(will be steaming) and set mold into a preheated 300 degree oven for
about 10-15 minutes to allow some of the steam to dry. Loosen bread
from sides of mold gently. Invert onto cooling racks and allow to
cool partially before serving.
