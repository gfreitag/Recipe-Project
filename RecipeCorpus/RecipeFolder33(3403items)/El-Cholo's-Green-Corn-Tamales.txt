Remove the husks from the corn. Reserve the husks. Cut the kernels
from the cobs to make the amount of whole kernel corn specified in
the ingredients (use any excess for other projects). Combine the corn
kernels and half the cornmeal in a food processor. Process into a
chunky puree. Use an electric mixer to beat the shortening and butter
together in a large bowl until creamy. Mix in the sugar, half & half
and salt. Add the corn puree and the remaining cornmeal. Mix until
well blended. Overlap 2 corn husks (for each tamale) on the work
surface. Spread 1/4 cup of corn filling down the center of the husks,
forming a 2"x4" rectangle of corn puree. Place 1 cheese strip and 2
chile strips in the center of the filling. Spread another 1/4 cup of
corn filling over the chile and cheese, covering the filling
completely. Fold the two long sides of the husks over the filling.
Fold in the ends. Tie with string. Repeat with the remaining husks,
puree, cheese and chiles, forming the tamales. Stand the tamales on a
steamer rack. Place the rack in a deep pot over boiling water. Cover.
Steam until the tamales are firm to the touch (about 50 minutes).
Serve hot with your choice of sauce(s).
