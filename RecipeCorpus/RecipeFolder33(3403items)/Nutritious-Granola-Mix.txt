Granola mix: In a large bowl, combine oats, rye, wheat, wheat germ,
coconut, sunflower seeds, nuts and sesame seeds. Stir until blended
well. In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, water, oil, honey,
molasses, salt, vanilla and cinnamon. Heat and stir until sugar is
dissolved. DO NOT boil. Pour syrup over oat mixture. Stir with a
wooden spoon until syrup coats all ingredients. Spread mixture in two
13 x 9 x 2-inch pans or on 2 large cookie sheets with raised edges.
Bake in preheated 300-degree oven 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
For crunchier texture bake 7-10 minutes longer. Cool on racks. Stir
in the dried fruit that has been chopped into bite sized pieces. You
can put this into containers and keep in cool dry place for up to 6
months. Do not refrigerate.

Yield: About 10 cups.
