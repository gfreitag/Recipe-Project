Joan Laux of Valparaiso, Indiana (20 miles southeast of Gary), knows
how to serve potatoes: hot off the grill! These standout spuds
marinate in a mixture of Italian spices before Joan skewers and
barbecues them.

1. Scrub potatoes. Cut each in half, or quarter extra-large potatoes.
Place in a microwave-safe 1 1/2-quart casserole with the water.
Microcook, covered, on 100% power (high) for 4 to 5 minutes or till
just tender, stirring once. Drain and cool the potatoes slightly.

2. In a medium bowl, stir together mayonnaise or salad dressing,
chicken broth, Italian seasoning and garlic powder till well
combined. Add potatoes; toss to coat. Cover and chill the mixture for
at least 1 hour.

3. Thread potatoes onto 4 long skewers, leaving about 1/4 inch between
pieces. Grill kabobs in an uncovered grill directly over medium coals
12 to 14 minutes or till golden, turning occasionally.

Makes 4 to 6 side-dish servings. Source: Midwest Living, August 1995
