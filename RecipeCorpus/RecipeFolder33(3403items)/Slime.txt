Title: Slime
Categories: Kids
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  White glue (Elmer's)
1 1/2 c  Water
Food coloring of choice
1 ts Borax
1/2 c  Water
Mix the glue, 1 1/2 c water and food color until it's not sticky.
Seperately dissolve the borax and 1/2 c water.  Add to the glue
solution. You will get a very thick clump of Slime where the two mix.
Now you must work in the rest of the solution.  With clean hands,
knead the Slime to get it to mix.  This will take about 10 minutes or
so, and is not very difficult as the Slime easily seperates between
your fingers. If you desire a looser, more slimy texture, add a bit
more water and knead it in. The more slimy this is, though, the more
apt it is to get stuck in any fabric it comes in contact with.
