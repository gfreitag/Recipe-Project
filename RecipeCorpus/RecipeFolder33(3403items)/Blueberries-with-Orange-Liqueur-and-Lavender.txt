Title: Blueberries with Orange Liqueur and Lavender
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 5 half-pints
1 c  Orange-flavored liqueur
1 c  ;Water
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 lb Fresh blueberries
20    Fresh lavender flower heads
Prepare the jars, lids and boiling-water bath.

Combine liqueur, water and sugar in a pan and cook over medium-high
heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is dissolved and the mixture
has come to a boil.  Remove the pan from the heat.

Meanwhile, pick over, wash and dry the blueberries.  Then pack them
in hot, dry jars, placing four lavender flower heads in each jar.
Leave 1/2" headspace.  Pour the hot liquid into the jars, just
covering the berries. Wipe rims with a clean towel and attach lids
securely. Place the jars in the boiling-water bath and, when water
returns to a full boil, process for 15 minutes.  Remove the jars,
cool, label and store.

Oster writes: "The happy teaming of blueberries, orange and lavender
yields a lovely sauce for ice cream, vanilla or tapioca pudding,
mousse, cheesecake, pound cake or an orange or lemon layer cake."
