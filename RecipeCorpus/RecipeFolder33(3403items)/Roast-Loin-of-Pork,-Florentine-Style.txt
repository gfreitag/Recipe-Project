Title: Roast Loin of Pork, Florentine Style
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1    Pork loin roast, about 3 lb.
2    Garlic cloves
1    Sprig fresh rosemary
4    Leaves fresh sage
Salt to taste
Ground pepper to taste
-(both divided use)
2/3 tb Olive oil
Heat oven to 325'F.

Cut away excess fat from pork loin and clean the meat. Finely chop
together the garlic, rosemary and sage. Reserve a generous pinch of
rosemary and sage. Add salt and pepper and mix. With a sharp knife,
make several deep incisions in the meat and stuff them with the
chopped herbs and spices. Coat the outside of the roast with olive
oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and reserved rosemary and sage.

Place the meat in a small roasting pan filled with about an inch of
water. Roast uncovered for 1-2 hours, basting occasionally. The roast
is cooked when the juices run clear when the roast is pierced with a
fork.

Remove the roast to a plate, allow it to cool, then wrap in aluminum
foil to keep it moist.

Store in refrigerator and return to room temperature for serving.
