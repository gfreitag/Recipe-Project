Title: Canned Spiced Peaches From The South
Categories: Can/preserv
Yield: 24 servings
3    1-quart canning jars
6 lb Peaches
8 c  Sugar
2 3/4 c  Cider vinegar
4    Cinnamon sticks
4 ts Whole cloves -- * see note
* Use additional cloves and cinnamon sticks for spicier peaches. This
recipe calls for 24 medium-sized peaches, which is about 6 pounds
total weight.

1. Place into a large heavy kettle or sauce pan: sugar, cider
vinegar, and 1-1/3 cups water. Tie cinnamon sticks and 4 teaspoons of
whole cloves in a double thickness of cheesecloth; add to the
saucepan. 2. Place pan over medium heat and stir until sugar is
dissolved. Bring to boiling, cover, and boil for five minutes.
Uncover and boil five minutes longer. 3. While sugar mixture is
boiling, prepare peaches. Have a large pot of water boiling rapidly.
Wash peaches, and working with 7 to 8 peaches at a time, plunge them
into the boiling water. Immediately plunge into cold water and gently
slip off the skins. Leave peaches whole or cut in half and remove
pit. Whole peaches are the usual southern tradition. 4. Insert a
whole clove into each peach, or for spicier peaches insert several
cloves. Add peaches to hot syrup. Bring syrup to boiling again and
simmer peaches for 10 minutes or until tender. 5. Quickly drain one
sterilized jar. Pack hot peaches into jar, adding a cinnamon stick
for spicier flavor. Cover top with waxed paper and set aside while
preparing 2nd and 3rd jar. Repeat steps 3 through 5 with 7 to 8 more
peaches for 2nd jar. Repeat again for 3rd jar. 6. Bring syrup to
boiling and pour into jars to within 1/2 inch of top. Wipe away any
food about fill line and on rim of jar; immediately seal.

Yield: about 3 quarts.
