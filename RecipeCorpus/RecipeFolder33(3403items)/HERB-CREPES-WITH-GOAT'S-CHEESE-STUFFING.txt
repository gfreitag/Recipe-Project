(Two crepes per person for a first course, serve with the tomato
sauce)

Break the eggs into a liquidizer or food processor and add the flour,
salt and pepper to taste. Whiz, gradually adding the milk and water.
Add the snipped chives, which unless snipped just wrap themselves
around the blades, and the other herbs and whiz until the herbs are
fine. Pour the crepe batter into a jug and leave to stand for half an
hour.

To cook the crepes, melt a small amount of butter, about 1 1/2 ts, in
a crepe or omelette pan, and swirl it over the surface of the pan.
Pour in just enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan, swirling
the batter around so that the crepe will be as thin as possible. Over
a moderate heat, cook for about 30 seconds, then turn the crepe over
using a small palette knife or spatula and your fingers.

As they are cooked, stack the crepes with a piece of greaseproof (wax)
paper between each, to prevent them sticking together.

For the filling, put the cheese into a food processor with the egg
whites and whiz until smooth.

Put a generous teaspoonful of filling in the middle of each crepe and
fold into a fat rectangle. Put the stuffed crepes into an oiled or
buttered heatproof dish and brush them with melted butter. Bake in a
preheated moderate oven 180 oC for 20 minutes.
