Title: Wine Marguerita 2
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Mixed drink
Yield: 20 servings
2 qt Dry White Wine
1/2 qt Water -- (or soda water)
1    12 1/2 Oz. C  Lemonade
Concentrate -- [frozen]
12    Whole Fresh Limes
9 oz Lime Mix Powder -- Tang or
Bar mix
7 oz Triple Sec
Combine water, limeade concentrate, lime powder and juice squeezed
from limes.  Stir briskly until dissolved.  Add wine and Triple Sec,
cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. To create a
frothy marguerita combine the whites from 2 eggs with 6 servings of
the marguerita and whip in a blender for 2 or 3 minutes. [yes, the
recipe does say to put in the egg whites. Is this safe? What else
could be substituted to make a froth ?  Just buzz in the blender with
ice chips?]

Makes 20 servings.
