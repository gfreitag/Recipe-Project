FOR SAUCE: Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.
Add onions and saute until golden and tender, about 12 minutes. Add
vinegar and boil until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add both
broths and boil until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. (Can be
made 1 day ahead. Cover, chill.)

FOR GRITS: Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add all mushrooms and onion and saute until mushrooms are tender,
about 3 minutes. Add 3 C water and bring to boil. Gradually stir in
grits. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until grits are
tender and liquid is absorbed, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and
stir in both cheeses. Season grits to taste with salt and pepper.
Cover to keep warm.

FOR STEAK: Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.
Season steaks with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and cook to
desired doneness, about 3 1/2 mmutes per side for rare. Transfer to
plates. Tent with foil to keep warm. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add
bourbon to skillet (mixture may ignite) and boil until almost all
liquid evaporates, about 30 seconds. Add sauce to skillet and bring
to boil. Remove from heat. Add butter and whisk just until melted.
Season with salt and pepper.

Divide grits equally among plates. Spoon sauce over steaks and serve.
