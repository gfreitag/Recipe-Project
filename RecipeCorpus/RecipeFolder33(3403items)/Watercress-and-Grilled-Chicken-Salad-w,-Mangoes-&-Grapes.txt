set aside.

2.  Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt & pepper, and then grill
over a medium-hot fire until cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes on

it is opaque throughout.  Remove from the heat, allow to cool to room

and bell pepper.  Stir the dressing very well, add just enough to
moisten the ingredients, and then toss well and serve.
