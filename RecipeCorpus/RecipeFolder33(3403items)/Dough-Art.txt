Categories: Kids
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  All purpose flour
1 c  Salt
1 c  Water
Mix flour and salt well, then slowly add the water mixing with a
spoon to form a ball if you add too much water the dough becomes too
sticky. Knead 7-10 min until dough is smooth and firm. {keep dough in
a plastic bag to keep moist} Then roll out and shape as you would
cookies. You can air dry, but if you want the puffier look, preheat
the oven at 325-350 NEVER HIGHER, bake on foil covered cookie sheet
for 30min for 1/4" of dough thickness, or until light brown. If
ornament puffs up too much, lower heat to 50-75 poke hole in bubble
with toothpick. Submitted By BOBBI ZEE   On   07-30-95
