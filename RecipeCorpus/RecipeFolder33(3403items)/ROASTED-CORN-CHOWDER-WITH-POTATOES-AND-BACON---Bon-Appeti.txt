corncobs.

Saute bacon in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat until just
crisp, about 4 minutes. Add onion and butter and saute until onion is
soft and pale golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and stir
2 minutes. Gradually mix in 4 1/2 C stock. Add potatoes and simmer
until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in corn, chopped
pepper and half and half. Simmer until chowder is slightly thickened,
about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day
ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

Bring soup to simmer, thinning with more stock if desired. Ladle soup
into bowls. Garnish with chives.
