FOR SORBET: Combine water and sugar in heavy small saucepan. Stir

to boil. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and stir until melted. Add
cocoa, corn syrup and extracts and whisk until smooth. Chill 1 hour.

Transfer chocolate mixture to ice cream maker and process according to
manufacturer's instructions. Freeze sorbet in covered container.

FOR COOKIES: Preheat oven to 325'F. Spray heavy nonstick baking sheet
with vegetable oil spray. Whisk egg whites in medium bowl until
begin- ning to foam. Add flour, sugar, minced mint and extracts to
batter. Whisk until smooth; whisk in butter.

Drop 1 level T batter near each end of prepared baking sheet. Using
back of small spoon, spread each T of batter to 4 1/2 to 5-inch
round. Bake cookies until light brown but still soft, about 7
minutes. Loosen cookies gently with edge of spatula and turn over.
Bake cookies until brown, about 4 minutes longer. Using wooden spoon
handle and pot holder as aids, tightly roll 1 cookie at a time around
handle, forming narrow tube. Slide cookie off handle; cool. Let
baking sheet cool. Repeat baking and rolling with remaining batter,
forming 2 cookies per batch (10 cookies total) and cooling baking
sheet between batches. (Sorbet and cookies can be made 1 day ahead.
Keep sorbet frozen. Store cookies airtight.)
