Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves
1/2 c  Each green beans & broccoli
-chopped to bite size pieces
1/2 c  Zucchini, thinly sliced
1 c  Roma tomatoes, diced

In a non-stick skillet, saute the first 5 ingredients until vegetables
start to soften. Add remaining ingredients and cook cover for 5-10

We usually add a generous shake of red pepper flakes to spice this
up; and you can use whatever veggies you have on hand or like.
