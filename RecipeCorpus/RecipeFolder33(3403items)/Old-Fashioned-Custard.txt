Title: Old-Fashioned Custard
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
2    Eggs
2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Fit the steel knife blade into the work
bowl of a food processor. Combine all ingredients in the bowl and
process until well mixed, about 10 seconds. Pour custard into 4
custard cups. Place cups in a baking dish, pour boiling water into
the dish to a depth of 1/2 inch. Bake 1 hour or until a knife
inserted in center comes out clean.

NOTE: A blender can be used in place of a food processor, but it will
take a little longer.
