[This is Cheshire Cat's "staple" bread - there's always fresh french
bread around, or in the works!]  This Easy French is exactly that -
easy. And from its light, chew interior to its crusty crust, it
tastes great.

Success Hints
-------------

To develop the crisp crust that French bread is famous for, turn the
machine off and reset it after the first knead cycle is completed.
This gives the bead extra kneadint time and results in a crisp crust.

Use regular or rapid bake cycles
