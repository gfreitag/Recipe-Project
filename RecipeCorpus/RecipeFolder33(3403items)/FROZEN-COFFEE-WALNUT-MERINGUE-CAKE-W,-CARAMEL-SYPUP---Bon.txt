2 tb Plus 1/2 C powdered sugar
1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts
3 lg Egg whites
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
6 tb Sugar
1 ts Instant coffee powder
1 ts Water
1 1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts,

3 pt Coffee frozen yogurt,
-slightly softened
FOR SYRUP: Combine sugar and 1/4 C hot water in heavy medium
saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat
to medium-high and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep
amber, brushing sides of pan with wet pastry brush to prevent sugar
crystals from forming and swirling pan occasionally, about 10
minutes. Remove from heat. Add 3/4 C hot water (mixture will bubble
vigorously). Stir caramel syrup over medium heat until any
undissolved caramel melts. Pour into small bowl. Cover and chill
overnight.

FOR MERINGUE: Preheat oven to 250'F. Line bottom of 9-inch diameter
springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with foil. Butter foil and
sides of pan. Dust foil and sides of pan with 2 tablespoons powdered
sugar; tap out excess. Sift 1/2 C powdered sugar into small bowl.
Stir in 1/2 C finely chopped nuts.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in large
bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 6 T sugar, 1 T at a time,
beating until stiff and glossy. Mix instant coffee powder and 1 t
water in cup until dissolved. Mix into egg white mixture. Fold in
walnut-sugar mixture in 2 additions.

Spread meringue evenly over bottom of prepared pan. Bake until firm
and crisp, about 2 hours 15 minutes. Cool completely in pan on rack.
Run knife around edge of pan to loosen meringue. Release pan sides.
Carefully peel foil from bottom of meringue. Return meringue to
springform pan and close sides of pan.

Spinkle meringue with 1/2 C coarsely chopped walnuts. Drizzle 4 T
caramel syrup evenly over nuts. Spread frozen yogurt evenly over.
Sprinkle 1/2 C coarsely chopped nuts atop cake. Drizzle with 3 T
syrup. Cover and freeze overnight. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep
frozen.)

Let cake soften slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes.
Release sides of springform pan. Press remaining 1/2 C coarsely
chopped walnuts onto frozen yogurt around sides of cake. Serve cake
with remaining caramel syrup.
