Categories: Holiday, Desserts
Yield: 96 servings
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Powdered sugar -- sifted
2 pk Gelatin -- unflavored
1/2 c  Water -- cold
1 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
1    Egg white -- at room
Temperature
1/8 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Peppermint extract
Few drops red food color
Prepare rectangular pan, 13 x9 x 2", with aluminum foil.  Spray foil
with cooking spray; coat with cornstarch mixture.  Mix cornstarch and
powdered sugar.  Shake excess cornstarch mixture from pan and
reserve.  Sprinkle gelatin on 1/2 cup cold water in small bowl to
soften.  Heat sugar, corn syrup, and 1/2 cup water to boiling in
2-quart saucepan, stirring constantly, just until small granulated
sugar is dissolved.  Cook, without stirring, to 250 on a candy
thermometer or until small amount of mixture dropped into very cold
water forms a ball that holds its shape but is pliable; remove from
heat.  Stir in gelatin mixture until gelatin is dissolved.  Beat egg
white and baking powder in medium bowl until stiff peaks form.
Continue beating on high speed while pouring hot syrup in a thin
stream into egg white.  Add peppermint extract and food color.  Beat
on high speed until soft peaks form.  Pour into pan and spread
evenly. Let stand uncovered at room temperature about 1 1/2 hours or
until top is dry. Turn out onto flat surface generously dusted with
reserved cornstarch mixture and remove foil.  Cut into about 1"
squares with long knife dipped into cold water.  Roll squares in
cornstarch mixture to coat all sides. Drizzle with melted vanilla
candy coating tinted with paste food color, if desired.  Let stand
uncovered on wire rack about 1 hour or until dry. Store in airtight
container at room temperature up to 3 weeks.
