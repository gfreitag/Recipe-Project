Yield: 10 servings
1    Pork shoulder roast
1 ts Celery seed

* Pork roast of about 3 pounds or more. You may double the sauce
recipe if cooking a large roast.

1. In a heavy skillet, brown the roast on all sides in a small amount
of oil. 2. Place the roast in a heavy, oven-safe pan with tight
fitting lid or a pan that you can seal with aluminum foil. 3. Place
the remaining ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil for
1 minute; pour mixture over the roast. Cover tightly. 4. Place the
roast in a preheated 325-degree oven and bake for about 35-45 minutes
per pound. Baste several times with the juices in the pan. 5. Remove
the roast and allow to cool slightly. Slice the roast into bite sized
thin pieces. For spicier meat, add additional hot pepper sauce and a
few drops of vinegar.
