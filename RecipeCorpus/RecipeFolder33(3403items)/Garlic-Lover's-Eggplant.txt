Categories: Vegetables, Healthy
Yield: 8 servings
2    Eggplants
10    Cloves garlic
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Buttermilk baking mix
1 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 lg Egg
Olive oil
Salad oil
1. Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch slices. Place in single layer on paper
towels. Sprinkle with salt and set aside for 30 minutes. 2. Using
garlic press, press 6 garlic cloves and place into mixing bowl. Add
flour, biscuit mix, oregano, pepper, slightly beaten egg and enough
water to make batter the consistency of pancake batter. 3. Pour half
olive oil and half salad oil to a depth of 1/4 inch in a skillet over
medium heat. Crush four garlic cloves with flat edge of knife; add to
oil and saute until lightly browned. Press the cloves against sides
of pan just before removing to release more of the garlic flavor. 4.
Coat each eggplant slice with batter; fry, being careful not to brown
too fast. (Do not burn.) Serve immediately.
