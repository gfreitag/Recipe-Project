Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Dijon mustard
2 tb Orange marmalade
1    Jalapeno pepper -- seeded
2 ts Fresh lime juice
1 ts Sliced black olives
4    Skinless chicken breast
Halves -- * see note

1. Seed the jalapeno, being careful to keep away from eyes. Combine
the mustard, marmalade, jalapeno, lime juice and oil. Add a pinch of
cayenne pepper if you want it hotter. 2. Cut a pocket in the side of
each chicken breast and spoon a little of the mustard sauce into the
opening. Baste the tops of the chicken with the mustard. 3. Place
chicken on a rack in a roasting pan. Bake in a pre-heated 350-degree
oven for 35-40 minutes or until chicken tests done. Baste once during
cooking with the mustard mixture.
