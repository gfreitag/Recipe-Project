Brush with oil. Spoon batter onto skillet by 1/3 cupfuls, forming
4-inch diameter pancakes. Cook pancakes until bottoms are brown and
bubbles form on top, about 3 minutes. Turn; cook until bottoms are
brown and pancakes are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Transfer to
plate and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.
