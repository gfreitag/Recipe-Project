cut into bite-sized pieces.

2. Saute onion and peppers in oil in a large skillet.

3. Add broccoli, carrots, tomato sauce, bay leaf, basil and salt to
taste. Blend thoroughly. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to
simmer, and cook vegetables until just tender. Will take about 15
minutes.

4. Stir in chard or spinach. Transfer to a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking
dish.

5. Blend parsley into prepared potatoes; spread over top of
vegetables.
