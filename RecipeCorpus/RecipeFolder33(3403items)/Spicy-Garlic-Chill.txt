The day before serving; in a dutch oven over high heat, brown the pork
until it is crispy and as much fat as possible has been rendered.
Remove the pork with a slotted spoon and drain it well in a colander
linked with paper towels.  Leave 1/4 cup of drippings in the dutch
oven; refrigerate the remainder.

Over medium-low heat, stir in onion, garlic and jalapeno; saute until
vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes.  Stir in brown sugar; cook a
few minutes more.  Remove from heat.

Stir in tomatoes, molasses and melted chocolate; stir in spices and
reserved pork.  Refrigerate overnight.

The next day, heat refrigerated chili mixture.  Remove solidified fat
from reserved dripping; discard.  Stir remaining drippings into chili.

Stir in beer, boiling water, red wine or vinegar, soy sauce and salt.

Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender and
the flavors have blended thoroughly, about 1-1/2 hours.  Stir in
habanero sauce to taste, simmer, covered for 1/2 hour.

Garnish each serving with sour cream and chopped cilantro.
