Title: Reva's Molasses Sugar Cookies
Categories: Newspaper, Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 6 doz cookys
1 1/2 c  Granulated sgar; divided
3/4 c  Vegetable shortening; melted
2 c  Flour; all-purpose
1/4 c  Molasses
1    Egg; slightly beaten
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the sugar with the melted
shortening, flour, molasses, egg, baking soda, cloves, ginger,
cinnamon and salt. Mix until well combined.

Although you can form cookies at this point, the dough will be easier
to handle if you cover and chill it for about 30 minutes.  Preheat
the oven to 375Ã¸F; lightly grease a cookie sheet.

Using your hands, form balls of dough about the size of a walnut.
Place the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar in a large shallow dish.  Roll
the balls in the sugar to coat completely.  Place on the prepared
cookie sheet, about 2 1/2 inches apart.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the cookies spread and are lightly
browned on the bottom.  Cool the cookies on a wire rack.  Store in an
airtight container.
