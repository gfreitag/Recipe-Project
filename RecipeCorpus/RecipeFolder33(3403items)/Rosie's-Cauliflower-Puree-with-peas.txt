This deceptively mild soup is actually brimming with flavorful
seasonings. The vitamin and protein rich brown rice miso, a soybean
paste, is stocked in the ecthnic section of larger markets and by
Asian groceries. Spike seasoning is an herb mix that can be found on
your supermarket's spice rack.  You can creat a variety of robust,
healthy vegetable purees using this recipe.  Try substituting an
equal amount of trimmed and chopped asparagus, carrot, or spinach for
the cauliflower. Combine the cauliflower and vegetable stock in a
stockpot. Cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes, until the
cauliflower is fork tender. Transfer the contents of the pot to a
blender, add the miso and cream cheese, and puree until smooth.
Return the puree to that stockpot.  Add all remaining ingredients
except the peas and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, until the
vegetables are tender.  Stir in the peas.
