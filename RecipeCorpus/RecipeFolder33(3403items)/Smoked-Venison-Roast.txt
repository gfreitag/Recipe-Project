Title: Smoked Venison Roast
Categories: Herbs/spice, Bbq/grill, Cajun/creol
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM--------------------WATER PAN SEASONINGS-------------------------
1 c  White wine, dry
1 md Onion, whole
1    Bell pepper, green
1 lg Garlic clove
2 tb Parsley, dry
1 ts Mint, dry, crushed
6    Drops Peychaud's bitters
*OR:
3    Drops Angostura bitters
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Liquid smoke
Halve and peel green pepper.

Prepare the smoker as you would for any other roast.  Put the
ingredients listed above in the water pan.

To cook venison, it is important to remove the fat and membrane from
the meat.  I stick a knife in the meat, then push some peeled cloves
of garlic into the slit.  You can push whole fresh cayenne peppers
and green onions in the slit also.

After stuffing the slits you have made, sprinkle salt over the
surface and pat in.  Do the same with red cayenne pepper.

I would smoke the venison on the bottom rack and put a pork roast on
the top rack of the smoker. That way it won't be so dry.
