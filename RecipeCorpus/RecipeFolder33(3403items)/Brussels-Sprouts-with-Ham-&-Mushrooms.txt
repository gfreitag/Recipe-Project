Simmer 1 pound Brussels sprouts in salted water for about 20
minutes, or until they are tender, and drain them.  Chop enough lean
cooked ham to make 1 cup and slice 1/2 pound mushrooms.  Place half
the Brussels sprouts in a well-buttered casserole dish, and cover
them with alternating layers of the ham, the mushrooms, and the
remaining Brussels sprouts, finishing with a layer of ham.
Beat 2 egg yolks into 3/4 cup heavy cream, add 1/4 cup grated
Parmesan cheese, and pour the sauce over the casserole. Sprinkle with
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, and bake the Brussels sprouts
in a hot oven (400 degrees F) for 10 to 15 minutes.
