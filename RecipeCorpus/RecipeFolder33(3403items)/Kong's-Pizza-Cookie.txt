Chocolate chips; large bag
Purchase a disposable aluminum pizza pan (12 1/4").
Mix up Nestle's Toll House cookie recipe from bag and spread on
greased pizza pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes,
checking often. One person said she still had enough cookie dough
left over for about a dozen cookies, but use your own judgement on
whether to use all the dough at once.  She bought clean pizza [PAUSE]
boxes and presented the pizzas to the recipients and said they were
really a hit.
