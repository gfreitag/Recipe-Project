Title: Bacon and Tomato Pasta
Categories: Pasta/rice, Tomatoes
Yield: 4 servings
3 sl Bacon
4    Tomatoes
-OR
2 c  Quartered cherry tomatoes
1 ts Dried basil
-OR
3 tb Fresh slivered basil
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/2 lb Dry spaghetti
1/2 c  Parmesan or other sharp
-cheese (I like Asagio and
-kefalytori) or to taste
Bring 4 1/2 quarts salted water to a boil.

Cook bacon in a wide skillet until crisp. Drain on towels, then
crumble into cooled skillet (after pouring off fat from skillet.) Cut
tomatoes into small pieces (no need to peel) and put in skillet with
basil, salt and pepper.

Add spaghetti to boiling water, stir to separate strands and boil
about 8 minutes, or until it's cooked through but still very firm to
the bite. Set a colander in the sink.

Remove the noodles from heat, and drain in the colander.

Place the skillet on the burner so the tomatoes and bacon can begin to
heat. Shake the noodles once or twice. (Don't worry about removing
every drop of water.)

When the tomatoes in the skillet begin to sizzle (it shouldn't take
more than a minute), add the noodles to the skillet and toss quickly.

Serve on plates sprinkled with cheese.

Serve on bread and salad made with lettuce and grated carrots and
dressed with a vinaigrette made with oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and
Dijon mustard. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
