Title: Cranapple Pork Chops
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
4    Boneless Pork Loin
Chops, 3/4" Thick
2 lg Green Apples, Pared,
Cored & Quartered
1 tb Butter
1 tb Peanut Oil
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Cranapple juice
1/3 c  Whole cranberry sauce
Trim off excess fat from the chops. Set aside. Cut each apple quarter
into wedges. Heat the butter in a large, heavy skillet. Quickly brown
the apples ~ do not let them get soft. Remove. Add the oil. Brown the
chops on each side. Season with salt and pepper. Top with the apples.
Combine the cranapple juice and the cranberry sauce. Pour over the
pork and apples. Cover. Cook over medium heat until done (25-30
minutes). Remove to a platter. Spoon over with sauce (to thicken the
sauce if needed, combine 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch with 2
tablespoons of cranapple juice and stir into the pan juices, cooking
until thick).
