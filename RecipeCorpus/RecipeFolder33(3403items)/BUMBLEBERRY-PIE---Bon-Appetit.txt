FOR CRUST: Combine flour and salt in processor. Add shortening and
process using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk
6 T water, egg and vinegar in small bowl to blend. Gradually add to
flour mixture, processing with on/off turns until moist clumps form.
If dough is too dry, add water by teaspoon to moisten. Gather dough
into 2 equal balls and flatten into disks. Wrap each disk in plastic
and refrigerate 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.
Let soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.)

Preheat oven to 400'F. Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured
surface to 11-inch-diameter round. Transfer dough to 9-inch diameter
glass pie dish. Trim crust even with edge of pie dish.

FOR FILLING: Combine all ingredients in large bowl and stir to
combine. Spoon mixture into pie crust.

Roll out remaining dough disk on lightly floured surface to
11-inch-diameter round. Place round atop pie filling. Trim crust,
leaving 1/2-inch overhang. Fold top crust edge under bottom crust
edge, pressing to seal. Crimp edges. Cut slits in top crust to allow
steam to escape. Place pie on baking sheet and bake 25 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350'F and bake until crust is golden and
juices bubble, about 30 minutes. Transfer pie to rack and cool.
