Title: Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese on Cucumber
Categories: Sandwich, Fish/seafoo, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  Fat-free cream cheese
1 ts Freshly snipped chives
1 ts Drained tiny capers, chopped
1/4 ts Finely grated lemon zest
Freshly ground black pepper
-to taste
1    Whole seedless (hothouse)
-cucumber, washed, ends
-trimmed
4 oz Thinly sliced smoked salmon
It's essential for these "sandwiches" to be made on hothouse
cucumbers, because they are practically seedless and make the best
base, not being too moist. When buying smoked salmon, look for Nova,
which is less salty than lox.

1. Combine the cream cheese, chives, capers, lemon zest and pepper in
a small bowl. Set aside.

2. Cut the cucumber in half crosswise to make 2 pieces, each about 4"
long. Thinly cut both pieces lengthwise to make 12 slices about 1/8"
thick.

3. Lay the cucumber slices on a paper towel and pat both sides dry.
Spread each slice with about 1 teaspoon of the reserved cream-cheese
mixture. Lay a slice of salmon to fit over each of 6 cucumber slices;
cover with the remaining 6 cucumber slices, cream-cheese side down.
