Title: Pinch Pie

No Ingredients Found
This terrific meringue tart shell has been resurrected from the "Joy
of Cooking" - it's been dropped from later editions, probably thought
to be too old fashioned.  It has a satisfying meringue crunch with a
soft chewy interior.  It's just right for sliced sweetened fruit and
whipped cream.

SIFT:

1 cup sugar

PLACE ON A PLATTER:

3 egg whites
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt

COMBINE IN A SMALL CUP:

1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp vinegar
1 tsp water

Whip the egg whites by hand until they are very stiff.  Add the sifted
sugar very slowly, 1/2 tsp at a time, alternately with a few drops of
the combine liquids.  Beat constantly.  When all the ingredients have
been added, continue to beat the meringue for sseveral more minutes.
(Can also be done with an electric mixer, but beat all ingredient
together except the sugar.  Using high speed, slowly add sugar
tbspfuls at a time.) Heap on a lightly greased platter and shape with
spatula.  Bake in a 275F oven for about an hour or longer.  When
ready to serve, fill the center with fresh sliced fruit and top with
whipped cream. Origin: Great Food Without Fuss. Shared by: Sharon
