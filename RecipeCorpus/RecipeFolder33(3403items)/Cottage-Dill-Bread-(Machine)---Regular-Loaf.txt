This bread will make a bread machine believer out of anyone.  The
aroma is heaven, and the taste lives up to the aroma.  Cottage Dill
is best served warm from the oven or toaster; the heat liberates the
spices for a full, rich flavor.

Success Hints
-------------

Use small curd, low fat cottage cheese.

The liquid in cottage cheese varies.  If your dough is too dry, try
adding water, a tablespoon at a time, during the kneading until dough
appears moist and pliable.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
