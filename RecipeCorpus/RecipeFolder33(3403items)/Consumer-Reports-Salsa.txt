In a food processor, finely chop the garlic and jalapeno peppers. Add
the tomatillos and chop again.  Remove the mixture and combine with
the remaining ingredients.  The salsa can be served immediately, but
the flavors will blend nicely if it is chilled for several hours or
overnight.

This is a relatively mild salsa.  To turn up the heat, add more
jalapenos or some cumin.  Tomatillos can be omitted, but the salsa
will taste more like tomato salad.
