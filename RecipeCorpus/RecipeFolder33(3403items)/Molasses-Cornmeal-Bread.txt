Vera Brandt of Holstein, Iowa, bakes this molasses-sweetened yeast
bread to compete at Iowa's Clay County Fair.

1. In a small saucepan, bring the milk just to a boil.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 c up of the milk with cornmeal,
molasses, shortening and salt; set aside.

3. Cool remaining milk to warm (105-F to 115-F). Add yeast and stir
to mix; let soften for 5 minutes.

4. Add softened yeast to cornmeal mixture. Add 1 1/2 cups of the
flour and beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds,
scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.

5. Using a spoon, stir in as much remaining flour as you can. Turn
out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining
flour to make a moderately stiff dough that's smooth and elastic (6
to 8 minutes total).

6. Shape dough into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn
once. Cover; let rise in a warm place till nearly doubled (about 1
hour).

7. Punch dough down. Shape dough into a loaf. Place in a greased
9x5x3-inch loaf pan.

8. Cover and let rise in a warm place till nearly doubled (45 to 60
minutes).

9. Bake the bread in a 375-F oven for about 40 minutes or till done.
Cover loosely with foil the last 15 to 20 minutes, if necessary, to
prevent overbrowning. Remove the bread from the pan; cool on a wire
rack. Makes 1 loaf.
