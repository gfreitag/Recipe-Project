4 c  Mixed vegetables
2/3 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  White wine

1/2 c  Chopped onions
3    Garlic cloves -- minced
1/4 ts Thyme

* You will need a total of 4 cups fresh vegetables cut into bite-sized
pieces. Some good choices are: green beans, broccoli flowerettes,
cauliflower, red and green bell peppers, whole baby carrots, zucchini
and hearts of celery.

1. Combine all ingredients except 1/2 cup parsley in a large, heavy
pot. Add enough water to cover vegetables. Cover tightly and cook
over medium heat until vegetables are just tender but still crisp.
This will take 10-12 minutes. 2. Remove from heat, remove cover, and
let vegetables cool in the pot. When cool, transfer to serving dish.
Cover; chill to allow flavors to blend. Bring to room temperature to
serve; top with remaining parsley.
