Categories: Desserts, Cajun/creol
Yield: 4 servings
4    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  ;Water
3 tb Butter; melted
3/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
Butter; melted
In mixer bowl, combine egg yolks, milk, water and 3 tablespoons melted
butter; beat until well blended.  Add flour and salt; beat until
smooth. Heat 10-inch omelet or crepe pan over medium-high heat, until
just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.  Brush pan lightly with
melted butter. For each crepe, pour in 1/4 cup batter, tipping and
tilting pan to move batter quickly over bottom.  Cook until lightly
browned on bottom and dry on top.  Remove crepe from pan or, if
desired, turn and brown other side. Brush pan lightly with melted
butter as needed to prevent sticking. Stack crepes between layers of
wax paper until ready to fill.
