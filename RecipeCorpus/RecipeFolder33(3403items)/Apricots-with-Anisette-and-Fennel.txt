Title: Apricots with Anisette and Fennel
Categories: Can/preserv, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 2 quarts
3 lb Fresh apricots
2 1/2 c  ;Water
1/2 c  Anisette
2 c  Sugar
4    6" sprigs fresh green or
-bronze fennel
Prepare the jars, lids and boiling-water bath.

Wash and dry apricots and then prick each one several times with a
toothpick or skewer.

Combine water, anisette and sugar in a pan and cook over medium-high
heat, stirring frequently until the mixture boils and sugar is
dissolved. Add apricots and simmer for 3 minutes.

Fill each hot, dry jar with the fruit and two fennel sprigs, leaving
1/2" headspace.  Pour hot liquid over the fruit until just covered.
Wipe the rims with a clean towel and attach lids securely.  Place
jars in the boiling-water bath and, when water returns to a boil,
process for 25 minutes.  Remove the jars, cool, label and store.

Oster writes: "The lushness of apricots combined with the fennel and
anise-flavored liqueur creates an elegant winter dessert.  Cinnamon
basil and cinnamon liqueur make a spicy alternative.  Serve the whole
apricots in a footed dish, perhaps embellished with creme fraiche or
mascarpone, a creamy dessert cheese, and plain butter or sugar
cookies."
