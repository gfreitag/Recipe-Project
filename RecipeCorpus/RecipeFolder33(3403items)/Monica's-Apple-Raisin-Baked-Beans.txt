Four ingredients combine for these easy beans from Monica Curran of
Park Ridge, Illinois (just northwest of Chicago). "At our cookouts,"
says Monica, "I've even received compliments from friends who aren't
normally bean lovers." Heat these beans on your range top or right on
the grill.

1. In a foil pan, combine all ingredients. Place directly over medium
coals.

2. Cook, uncovered, about 15 minutes or till mixture is of desired
consistency and heated through, stirring once or twice.

Makes 6 to 8 side-dish servings.

Note: To cook on top of your range: In a medium saucepan, combine all
the ingredients. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered,
for 5 to 10 minutes or till desired consistency. Source: Midwest
