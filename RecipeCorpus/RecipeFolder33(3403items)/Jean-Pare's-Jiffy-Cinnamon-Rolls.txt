In large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
Using pastry blender of 2 knives, cut in butter until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs.  Pour in milk, stirring lightly with fork,
and adding a little more milk if needed to make dough soft.  Turn out
onto light floured surface; knead gently 8-10 times. Roll into 12 x 8
inch rectangle. CINNAMON TOPPING: In bowl, cream together butter,
brown sugar and cinnamon. Drop 1 tsp into each of 12 large greased
muffin cups. Spread remaining mixture over dough rectangle. Sprinkle
currants over top; roll up, jelly roll style, from long side.  Cut
into 12 equal slices. Place in muffin cups. Put baking sheet on oven
rack below muffin cups to catch any drips. Bake in 400 oven until
