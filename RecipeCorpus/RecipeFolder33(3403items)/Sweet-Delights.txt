Title: Sweet Delights
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 60 servings
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 pn Salt
1/3 c  Almonds -- ground
1/3 c  Black walnuts -- ground
1/3 c  Hazelnuts
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Powdered sugar
1. Have butter at room temperature. You may try solid margarine with
almost the same success as with butter. Place butter in a mixing
bowl. Beat with electric mixer. Gradually add granulated sugar while
continuing to beat; stir in vanilla extract and salt. Add ground nuts
and flour; roll into a ball and chill for 15 minutes. 2. Break off
pieces of dough and roll between palms of your hands to form balls
the size of a small walnut. Do not make these too large. Place on
ungreased cookie sheets. 3. Bake in preheated 300-degree oven for
18-20 minutes. Remove and roll, while still warm, in powdered sugar.

Yield: About 5 dozen.
