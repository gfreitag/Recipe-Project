Title: Pork Chops W/black Bean Sauce
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
16 oz Black Beans
1/4 c  Red Bell Pepper, Diced
1 cl Garlic, Minced
1 sm Shallot, Minced
1 3/4 c  Chicken Stock
1 tb Wine
4    Boneless pork chops
1 tb Oil
1    Red bell pepper
Parsley
Combine the beans (with their liquid), diced red bell pepper, garlic,
shallot, 7/8 of the chicken stock and the wine in a large saucepan.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add
the remaining stock and mix well. Simmer another 10 minutes. Heat
another heavy skillet about 15 minutes before the beans are done.
Heat the oil. Saute the chops until browned on both sides. Remove the
chops and pour off as much fat as possible. Pour the bean sauce into
the skillet. Place the chops on the sauce. Simmer until the chops are
done (about 5 minutes). Ladle the sauce onto a serving platter.
Arrange the chops over the sauce. Garnish with rings of sliced red
bell pepper and sprigs of parsley. From: Joel Ehrlich Submitted By
