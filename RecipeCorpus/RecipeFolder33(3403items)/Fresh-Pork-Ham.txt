3    Garlic cloves, slivered

Cut excess fat from ham and remove thick skin. With sharp knife, cut
5 or 6 deep slits in meat and fill each with salt, pepper and a
sliver each of garlic, onion and bell pepper. Season entire outside.
Place in shallow pan, fat side up, and roast in 325 degree oven for

When done, remove roast but do not carve for at least 15 minutes.
Pour off some of the drippings, and over low heat stir in a little
flour and add some water to make gravy. Season gravy to taste. Cut up
some parsley in the gravy. Delicious served with rice and a spinach
casserole. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-03-95
