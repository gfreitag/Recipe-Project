Title: Italian Meringue Shells
Categories: Italian
Yield: 8 meringues
4 lg Egg whites, at room temp.
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
pn Salt
1 1/2 c  Minus 2 tb granulated sugar
1/2 c  Hot water
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until
foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt and continue beating until
stiff peaks form.

2. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and stir
well. Place mixture over medium-high heat and bring to a boil without
stirring. Boil for 1-2 minutes or until bubbles thicken and a few
drops dropped into ice water form a soft ball (238'F. on a candy
thermometer).

3. With the mixer on medium speed, add the vanilla to the whites and
pour the hot syrup into the beaten egg whites in a slow, steady
stream. Beat until the mixture is completely cool, smooth and shiny,
anywhere from 6-8 minutes.

4. Heat the oven to 200'F. and place the meringue mixture into a
piping bag with a 1/2" star or plain tip.

5. Place a piece of aluminum foil or wax paper on a baking sheet.
Using a cup or small saucer, trace 8 (3") rounds on the paper with a
toothpick or skewer. Spray lightly with baking spray.

6. Beginning in the center of each round, pipe out the meringue in
concentric circles. To form the sides, pipe 2 or 3 additional rings
on top of the outside edge. The meringue also can be spooned on the
3" circle outlines and smoothed into a small shape using a rubber
spatula.

7. Bake the meringue for 2 hours, or until dry and crisp but not
brown. Cool on a baking sheet, then peel off the paper.
