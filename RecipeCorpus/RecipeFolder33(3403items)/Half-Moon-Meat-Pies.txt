Categories: Meats, Sandwich

1    Whole onion -- chopped
1 c  Mushrooms
3 tb Margarine -- solid
1 1/2 c  Sour cream

This is an extremely easy and versatile meat pie. Use the hamburger
meat in this recipe or use COOKED chopped beef roast or COOKED and
chopped chicken in filling. Salt is to be divided between pastry and
filling.

1. Melt margarine in skillet. Saute the mushrooms, onions and lean
ground round until lightly browned. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2
cup sour cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper and dash of nutmeg or
allspice if desired. Set aside.

2. Mix the flour, remaining salt and the sugar in a bowl. Cut the
shortening in until mixture is crumbly. Mix egg yolk with remaining
sour cream; add to flour mixture and mix well.

3. Roll dough on floured surface and cut into 18 circles. Use a sour
cream carton for circle size guide or any other cutter that will give
you about 18 circles. Place 1 heaping teaspoon filling in center of
each circle. Fold over and seal edges, pressing with a fork dipped in
flour. Mix egg whites with 1 tablespoon water; brush over pies. Add a
few sprinkles of sesame seed or celery seed at this point if desired.

4. Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until
golden brown. Serve immediately. When rewarming these, do so slowly
so sour cream will not curdle. Best warmed in oven.

NOTES : Make these ahead of time to have on hand for sandwiches,
school lunches or to take to work. They can be frozen for short
periods of time; thaw partially and reheat slowly in oven. Recipe By
