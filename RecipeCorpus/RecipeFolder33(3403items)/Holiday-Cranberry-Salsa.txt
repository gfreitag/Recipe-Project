Title: Holiday Cranberry Salsa
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 3 cups
1 pk Fresh cranberries (12 oz)
2    Whole oranges
1/2 c  Sugar
1 bn Cilantro
1/2 md Onion
2    Jalapenos, de-veined, seeds
-removed
1    Fresh ginger root, peeled
-(1")
1/4 ts Green chile powder (if
-available)
Place cranberries in food processor. Squeeze in the juice of one
orange, cut the orange in quarters, and add it, including peel. Peel
the other orange, and add it in sections. Add sugar and cilantro.
Pulse for 1-2 minutes, until well-blended, keeping some texture.
Slice the onion and jalapenos into the mixture. Add ginger root and
process these ingredients with the cranberries. Add green chile
powder, to taste, blend. This makes 2-3 cups, keeps very well and can
be made a day or two ahead of time. It does get hotter as it sits,
however. Wonderful with blue corn chips! Submitted By MICHAEL
