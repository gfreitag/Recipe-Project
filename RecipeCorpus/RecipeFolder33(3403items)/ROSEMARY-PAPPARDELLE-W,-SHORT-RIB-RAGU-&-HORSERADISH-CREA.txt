MMMMM--------------------------ASSEMBLY-------------------------------
2    Carrots, coarsely chopped
2 c  Fresh peas or frozen
Mix 2 1/4 C flour and salt in large bowl. Whisk eggs, rosemary and
oil in medium bowl. Add egg mixture to dry ingredients and stir until
dough comes together. Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Gather dough into
ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and let rest 30 minutes.

Cut dough into 4 pieces. Line 4 large baking sheets with waxed paper;
dust with flour. Turn pasta machine to widest setting. Flatten 1
dough piece into rectangle. Run dough through machine twice, dusting
with flour if sticky. Adjust machine to next narrower setting. Run
dough through twice. Repeat narrowing rollers and running dough
through twice on each setting until pasta is 1/i6 inch thick, dusting
with flour if sticky. Cut pasta into 8-inch long, 3/4-inch-wide
strips. Arrange pasta strips on prepared baking sheet. Repeat rolling
and cutting of remaining dough pieces. Divide pasta among prepared
baking sheets. Toss with flour on sheets to prevent sticking, then
arrange pasta in single layer on baking sheets. Let stand 1 hour or
up to 3 hours at room temperature to allow pasta to dry slightly.
(Pasta can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate.)

SHORT RIB RAGU: Heat heavy large Dutch oven over high heat. Working in
batches, add ribs and brown on all sides, about 7 minutes per batch.
Remove ribs from Dutch oven. Add oil to Dutch oven. Reduce heat to
medium. Add onion, anchovies, garlic and capers and saute until onion
is translucent, about 6 minutes. Increase heat to high. Add wine and
boil until reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Add beef and chicken
stocks and bring to boil. Return ribs to Dutch oven. Reduce heat to
medium low, cover and simmer until meat is tender and falls off
bones, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 50 minutes.

Using tongs, remove bones and meat from stew. Transfer meat to plate;
cool slightly. Cut meat into small pieces and return to stew. (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

HORSERADISH CREAM: Combine all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.
Simmer until reduced to 1/3 C, stirring occasionally, about 20
minutes. Set aside.

ASSEMBLY: Bring short rib ragu to simmer over medium heat. Add
carrots and peas and cook until vegetables are tender and sauce
thickens slightly, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just
tender but still firm to bite, about 3 minutes.

Drain pasta and divide among 4 shallow soup bowls. Spoon ragu over
pasta. Top with dollop of horseradish cream and serve.
