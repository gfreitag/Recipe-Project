Marinate leg of lamb overnight, using Calvert's Cedar Street marinade
for beef. Make filling by combining the next 6 ingredients and mixing
well. Spread inside of flattened lamb leg with filling, keeping it in
the center. Roll the lamb around the stuffing and tie with twine at
1-1/2-inch intervals. For smoking, use a grill with a cover. Use hard
wood or mesquite as fuel. Build a hot fire that is no longer flaming.
Sear lamb until brown on all sides. Place lamb on platter until fire
cools slightly, and spread with coating. More coating should be
brushed on during smoking. Add lamb and smoke for approximately 1
hour with cover on, turning often. Test lamb for doneness (should be
pink). Let stand 10 minutes before removing string and slicing into
filled rounds. Source: Calvert's Mustard Cookbook
