Title: Flip Flop Fritters
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 lg Eggs
Oil
1. Put into a saucepan 1/2 cup boiling water and 1/4 cup butter or
solid margarine. Heat until butter melts, then add all at once 1/2
cup flour (all-purpose or bread flour). Using a wooden spoon or wire
whisk, stir hard until the dough forms a ball in the center of the
pan. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. 2. Add one egg and
beat until well blended. Add second egg and again beat to blend well.
The mixture should be very stiff; if it isn't let stand 10 minutes.
3. Have a deep skillet ready with oil heated to 375 degrees. Drop
mixture by spoonfuls into hot oil and fry until delicately brown. The
fritters will turn over as one side browns. Size of fritter depends
on what size spoon you use, but these should remain fairly small to
ensure thorough cooking. Drain well on paper towels.

Finish fritters accordingly: 1. Beignets: sprinkle with confectioner's
sugar. Sfogliatelle: brush with honey and sprinkle with nuts. 2. Slit
and fill with cream filling such as chocolate cream or vanilla sauce.
3. Place cinnamon and sugar in paper bag then shake warm fritters to
coat.
