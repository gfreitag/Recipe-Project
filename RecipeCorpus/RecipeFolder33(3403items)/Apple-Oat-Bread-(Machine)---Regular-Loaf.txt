This is a full-bodied oatmeal bread with the added sweetness of
apples and honey.  It goes well with smoked meats such as summer
sausage. For something different, try a curried salad filling.

Success Hints
-------------

Use unsweetened apples, canned in water.  Drain well and chop into
chunks.

Use frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed, with no water added.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
