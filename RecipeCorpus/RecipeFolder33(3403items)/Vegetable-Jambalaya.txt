moist. I've tested this recipe a few times, so be sure to add the
exact amount of broth called for. - Sheila Lukins

1. Heat oil in a large, heavy pot. Add the onion and cook over low
heat to wilt for 10 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic, celery and
carrots. Cook, stirring, 1 minute longer.

2. Mix in the spices and herbs. Add the bell peppers, black-eyed peas,
tomatoes with juices and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to medium-low and cook, partially covered, for 10 minutes for
flavors to blend. Adjust seasonings.

3. 1/2 hour before serving, add the zucchini and bring the mixture to
a boil. Stir in the rice, cover, reduce heat to low and cook for 20
minutes. Stir in the parsley and serve immediately.

NOTE: For a delicious jambalaya jamboree, why not fry up some catfish
or crab cakes? Add a big bowl of fresh cole slaw, slice some ripe red
tomatoes, and be sure to chill the ale.
