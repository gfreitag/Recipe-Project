Title: Rum And Banana Boat Souffle
Categories: Fruit, Alcohol
Yield: 4 servings
4    Bananas
4 tb Fresh lemon juice
Powdered sugar
1 tb Cornstarch
1/2 c  Light cream
2 lg Eggs -- separated
2 tb Rum
1. Wash bananas and dry well. Remove a very thin section of peel off
side of banana. You are trying to keep peel as intact as possible so
cut carefully. Remove the banana from peel. 2. Place 1 peel in each
of 4 individual baking dishes. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Set aside.
3. In a sauce pan combine 1 tablespoon powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon
cornstarch and light cream. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture
becomes very thick. 4. In a blender or food processor, puree two of
the bananas, or enough to make 1 cup of puree. You won't need the
other two bananas for this recipe. They can be mashed and 1 teaspoon
of lemon juice added; seal tightly and freeze for later baking use.
5. In a saucepan, combine cream mixture, banana puree, egg yolks and
rum; mix well. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens.
Remove from heat, transfer to a bowl, and chill slightly. 6. In a
mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Add a small
amount of the whites to banana mixture; mix well. Gently fold
remaining whites into the mixture. 7. Spoon mixture into banana
peels, piling slightly. Sprinkle with a little sifted powdered sugar.
8. Bake 15 minutes in a preheated 350-degree oven until top is
lightly browned. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve immediately.
Also good with a very light sprinkling of freshly ground nutmeg or
cinnamon.
