Flour
Beat together butter, lard and sugar. Add molasses, spices and
soda/water. Stir in enough flour to make a stiff dough. Roll into
pieces the size of hickory nuts in hand and flatten. Bake in a
moderate oven 10-15 minutes or until browned.

A note about Molasses Cookies: Molasses cookies are very common, but
they are not easy to make, the reason being that there is no rule you
can work by which will answer in all cases. All molasses does not
work alike. Some kinds will bear more water than others, and the
weather has to be taken into consideration. You can use more water in
cold weather than warm, at times 1/2 molasses, 1/2 water. Be very
careful and do not work more than necessary to mix. Many of the
recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
