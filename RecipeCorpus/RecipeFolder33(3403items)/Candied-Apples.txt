Remove stems from apples, wash, and pat dry.  Insert a wooden skewer
in each apple, running through the apple from stem end to base without
protruding all the way through the bottom end.  Combine sugar, corn
syrup, cinnamon candies, and water in medium-sized saucepan.  Cook
until candies dissolve, stirring constantly.  Be careful not to boil.
Add cinnamon, vanilla, cloves, and food coloring.  Mix thoroughly.
Boil mixture to 300 degrees using a candy thermometer without
stirring.  While mixture is boiling, generously prepare a baking
sheet with cooking spray so it's ready ahead of time. As soon as
mixture reaches 300 degrees, remove it from heat and quickly dip each
apple-one by one-into the mixture until it is thoroughly coated. Set
coated apples, standing on their bottoms with skewer pointing up, on
baking sheet until mixture hardens.  Let apples reach room
temperature before eating.
