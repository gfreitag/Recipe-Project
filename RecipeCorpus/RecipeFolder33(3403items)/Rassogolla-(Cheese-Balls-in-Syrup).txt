Title: Rassogolla (Cheese Balls in Syrup)
Categories: Desserts, Indian
Yield: 4 servings
300 g  Paneer
175 g  Ricotta cheese
350 g  Sugar
1 1/4 l  Water
Rube the *paneer and ricotta cheese with palm of your hand until
smooth and creamy. Divide into 16 balls.

Boil the sugar and water for 5 minutes over medium heat. Put the
balls into the syrup and boil for 40 minutes.

Cover and continue to boil for another 30 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

*PANEER (Home-made cottage cheese) 3.5 litres milk about 250ml warm
water about 5 Tbsp white vinegar

1. Bring the milk to the boil, stirring constantly, over a high heat.
Remove from heat.

2. Combine the water and vinegar.

3. Slowly add the vinegar solution to the boiled milk, stirring with a
wooden spoon. As soon as the milk curdles, do not add any more. (The
curd and whey will separate.)

4. Place three or four layers of cheesecloth in a sieve and strain the
curdled milk through them. Ties up the ends of the cheesecloth and
squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible. Hang it up to drain
thoroughly.

Note: When adding the water and vinegar mixture to the milk, do not
add more than necessary as this tends to harden the paneer.
