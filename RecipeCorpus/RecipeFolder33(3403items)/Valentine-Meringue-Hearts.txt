Title: Valentine Meringue Hearts
Categories: Desserts, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
3    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1 ds Salt
1 c  Sugar
Red food coloring
1 qt Vanilla ice cream
1 pt Strawberries -- sliced
Cut a heart pattern from a 4-1/2 inch square of paper. Cover baking
sheet with brown paper. (You can bake on the brown paper so make sure
it is clean.) Grocery store bags without writing on them are okay.
Draw 6 hearts on the brown paper using your pattern as a guide.

1. Beat egg whites with vanilla, cream of tartar and salt until
frothy. Add sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until
stiff peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Rub a bit between your
figures to feel that no sugar remains undissolved. Add food coloring,
a few drops to make a delicate pink color. 2. Spread meringue over
the heart shapes, 1/4 inch thick. Make into the heart shape using a
spoon to push and form into correct shape. Pipe rim 3/4 inch high
with pastry tube. 3. Bake in preheated 275-degree oven for 1 hour.
Turn off oven and let meringues dry in oven for 1 more hour. DO NOT
open oven door during this time. 4. Fill the cooled meringues with
scoops of ice cream and top with strawberries. Decorate with mint
leaves if desired.
