Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
2 c  Cake flour
2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter, softened
2 c  Sugar
4 lg Eggs
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
Melted and cooled
1 ts Vanilla extract
2/3 c  Sour cream
1 c  Hot water
Chocolate Orange Frosting
Preheat oven to 350.  Grease and flour 2 9-inch round cake pans.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
medium bowl.  Beat the butter in a mixer bowl till creamy.  Gradually
beat in the sugar till light and fluffy.  Beat in the eggs, one at a
time, beating after each addition.  Beat in the melted chocolate and
vanilla.  At low speed, add the dry ingredients alternately with the
sour cream, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.  Stir in the
hot water: beat at low speed just until blended.  The batter will be
thin.
Pour the batter into the prepared pans.  Bake for 30 to 35
minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes.  Unmold and cool
completely. Fill and frost cake when completely cooled.
