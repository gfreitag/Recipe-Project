Title: Basic Fried Fruit Pie Recipe
Categories: Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening -- solid
1/3 c  Water
Mixed fruit, dried --
Stewed
* Dried fruit which has been stewed and then sweetened is the
traditional filling. The most common fruits used are dried apples and
peaches.

Sift the flour and salt together, cut in the shortening and mix with
forks. Add water, a little at a time, while tossing flour mixture
with large fork. Roll out about 1/8 inch thick on a floured surface.
Cut about 4 inches in diameter. In each round, place 1-1/2
tablespoons cooked and sweetened mashed fruit (dried apricots,
peaches, prunes or applesauce). Moisten edges with cold water; fold
to make semi-circle and press edges together with a fork. Fry in
solid shortening melted to a depth of about 1/2 inch, or deep fry.
Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. If
you wish, you can also make a sauce of powdered sugar, margarine and
milk to drizzle over pies.
