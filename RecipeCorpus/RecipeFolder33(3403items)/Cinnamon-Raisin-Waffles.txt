Prepare waffle iron with cooking spray and heat up. In a small bowl,
combine the 3 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; set aside.
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda,
remaining sugar and cinnamon. In another mixing bowl, combine egg
whites, buttermilk, applesauce, maple syrup, vanilla, orange extract,

Cook until crisp and golden brown. Set aside. Repeat with remaining
