Title: ROVERS REWARDS
Categories: Pets
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Hot water or meat juices
1/2 c  Margarine
1/2 c  Powdered milk
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
1 ea Egg, beaten
3 c  Whole wheat flour
In a large bowl, pour hot water over margarine. Stir in powdered milk,
salt, sugar and egg. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after
each addition. Knead 3 to 4 minutes, adding more flour if necessary
to make a very stiff dough. Pat or roll to 1/2 inch thickness and cut
out with a dog biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet and
bake at 325 degrees for 50 minutes. Allow to cool and dry out till
hard. I bake these on an ungreased 14 x 15 1/2 inch air bake pan
which it *fills* using both large and small cookie cutters.  They can
be placed side by side since there is no rising.  They slide right
off onto an opened brown bag and cool and harden in no time.  I was
advised in DOGHOUSE by a learned fellow that it might not be a bag
idea to cut the sugar and salt quantities.  Gotta watch their health
too!  Considering what's in the treats to be bought, these are
considerably better for them.
