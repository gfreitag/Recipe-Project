Title: Devilled Corn
Categories: Appetizers, Bbq/grill, Vegetables
Yield: 1 recipe
Corn, as necessary
MMMMM------------------------BASTING OIL-----------------------------
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
1 pn Cayenne
1 ts Whole cumin seeds, lightly
-- crushed in a mortar &
-- pestle
Salt & pepper, as necessary
Use only unhusked corn.  Soak in water for at least 30 minutes.
Prepare either a grill or preheat an oven to 375F.

While the corn is soaking, whisk together all the basting
ingredients. When the corn has soaked for 30 minutes, carefully peel
back the husks & remove the silk.  Do not remove the husks entirely.
Using a pastry brush, brush the oil over the corn.  Close up the
husks & tie them closed. You need to ensure that the corn is well
wrapped otherwise it will dry out as it grills.

Place on grill & grill for 15 minutes, turning frequently.  If you do
not turn the corn, it will burn.  Or, bake in the middle of the
preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove husks & serve
immediately. Or let cool & refrigerate & serve as part of a salad
buffet.
