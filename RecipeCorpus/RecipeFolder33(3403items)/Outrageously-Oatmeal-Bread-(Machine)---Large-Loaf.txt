One taste of this full-bodied white bread and you'll never call
oatmeal "mush" again!  The light oat taste makes it a natural for
hearty morning toast.  The nicely-textured bread makes fine
sandwiches, too.

Success Hints
-------------

For added texture, add the oats after the first knead or at the beep
on the fruit and nut cycle.

For additional crunch, sprinkle a few oats on top of the loaft after
the final rise.

Instant oatmeal doesn't work, but quick-cooking oats do.

Use regular, rapid bake or delayed time bake cycle.
