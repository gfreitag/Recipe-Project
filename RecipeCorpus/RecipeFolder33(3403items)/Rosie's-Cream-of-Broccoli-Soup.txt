Because I use low-fat evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream,
this velvety soup has only 1-1/2 grams of fat per serving.  Adding
the bouillon cube to the water in which the broccoli cooks lends
added richness; if you're on a limited salt diet, use a
reduced-sodium bouillon cube.

Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Dissolve the bouillon cube in the boiling water.  Add the broccoli
and cook for 5-6 minutes, until it is bright green and fork tender.

Put the evaporated milk in a small saucepan.  Warm over low heat, just
until bubbles begin to form around the edge.  Remove the pan from the
heat.

Preheat a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat for about 1 minute.
Spray it twice with the vegetable oil.  Add the leeks and saute,
stirring often, for 7-8 minutes, until limp.  Stir in the flour and
cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the warm evaporated milk.  Continue to
cook, whisking constatnly, until the flour has dissolved and the
mixture is smooth.

Reduce the heat to low. Add the nutmeg, the garlic, and the broccoli,
along with its cooking liquid. Simmer for 5 minutes more, taking care
not to bring the soup to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and
stir in the basil and black pepper.
