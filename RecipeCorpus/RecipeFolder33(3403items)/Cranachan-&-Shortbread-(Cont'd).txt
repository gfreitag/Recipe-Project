Title: Cranachan & Shortbread (Cont'd)
Categories: Desserts, Scot/irish
Yield: 1 servings
8 oz Plain flour
4 oz Corn flour
8 oz Margarine
4 oz Castor sugar
dr Vanilla essence
Let all the ingredients come to room temperature. Blend the margarine,
vanilla essence and sugar in a large bowl. Combine the flours and
sift them into the bowl, mixing until you have a dough like a
shortcrust pastry texture. Don't knead or overwork the mixture or the
shortbread will become heavy when baked. Form the mixture into rounds
or fingers as described above and prick the surface with a fork.
Specialist shortbread moulding blocks are available but it can be
formed freehand or by using other cake moulds.

Bake open in a pre-heated oven at 190c for 25 minutes. Allow the
shortbread to turn a light brown without burning or scorching before
turning out onto cooling racks.
