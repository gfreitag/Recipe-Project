and coats the back of spoon.  Remove from heat to once.   Add
softened gelatin and stir until dissolved.  Blend in remaining

vanilla. Just before freezing beat egg whites until stiff.  Fold into
custard.

the flavor with not be quite so strong after the ice cream is frozen.

water.  Add instant coffee and stir to blend.  Add Coffee-chocolate
mixture to warm mixture in ice cream recipe.  Complete ice cream as
recipe directs.

MOCHA ALMOND FUDGE: Dissolve instant coffee in warm mixture in ice

chocolate sauce through ice cream after it is frozen.  This is easier
to do as you transfer the ice cream from the canister to another
container.

water over them.  Rinse with cold water and drain.  Pinch off the
skins and dry nut on paper.  Chop finely and add to the ice cream mix
just before freezing.  Blend in a few drops of food coloring.  This
is particularly nice for the holidays season.
