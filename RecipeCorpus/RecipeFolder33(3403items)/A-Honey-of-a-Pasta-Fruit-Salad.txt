Creamy honey-lemon dressing adds pizzazz to this refreshing side-dish
salad from Wendy Duch of East Lansing, Michigan. Wendy pairs the
salad with her bacon-wrapped pork medallions (see recipe on preceding
page).

1. Cook pasta according to package directions; drain and cool.

2. Meanwhile, plump raisins, if you like: In a large bowl, pour
boiling water over raisins. Let stand for 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly.

3. Add grapes, peaches or nectarines, celery, walnuts and cooled
pasta to drained raisins.

4. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, yogurt, honey, lemon peel
and lemon juice. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed till
nearly smooth and well mixed. Stir in whipping cream.

5. Pour dressing over pasta mixture; stir to coat. Cover and chill
for 2 to 6 hours. If necessary, stir in a little milk to moisten the
salad before serving.

Makes 8 side-dish servings.
