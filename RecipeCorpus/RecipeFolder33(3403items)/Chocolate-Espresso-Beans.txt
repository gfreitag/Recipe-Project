Title: Chocolate Espresso Beans
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 cups
1 c  Espresso beans
4 oz Milk chocolate
3 tb Cocoa
Preheat oven to 350'F. Place the espresso beans on a baking sheet and
toast for 8-10 minutes. Let cool. Melt the chocolate in a double
boiler over barely simmering water until smooth and creamy. Drop in
the espresso beans and stir until the beans are coated. Remove the
beans with a slotted spoon and allow the excess chocolate to drip
off. Place the beans on waxed paper, separating them so they do not
stick together.

When the coated beans are cool but the chocolate is still pliable,
roll the beans in your hands to form round balls. Roll each ball in
cocoa and set aside until the chocolate coating has set completely.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
