This family dish is world renowned. The combination of beer, brown
sugar and thyme blends into one delicate, pleasant flavor. Since the
stew is twice as good reheated over low heat, make it for the family
in a large quantity. It also freezes exceptionally well.

Blend together the 4 tablespoons flour, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon
pepper, and 1 teaspoon paprika, in a large bowl. Roll the meat cubes
in this mixture until they are well coated.

Melt the 1/2 cup butter or margarine in a large heavy metal saucepan.
Add the 6 large sliced onions, and saute' over medium heat until they
are softened and tender. Be careful not to brown the onions. Remove
the onions from the pan with a perforated spoon, pressing out as much
fat as possible.

Place the same pan over high heat and sear the cubes of meat, a few
at a time. This operation will give color to the finished carbonnade.
Return the onions and meat to the pan, and set it over low heat.

Tie together in a square cheesecloth the halved garlic clove, 1 bay
leaf, 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme, and 1/2 cup chopped celery leaves.

Add this to the meat, sprinkle the 1/4 cup chopped parsley on top,
and add the 3 tablespoons brown sugar and 2 1/2 cups beer. Bring to a
simmer, while stirring, then cover tightly and poach over low heat
until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

Discard the bouquet garni, or cheesecloth bag of seasonings. Add the 2
tablespoons vinegar. Simmer for 5 minutes.

Serve with a dish of boiled potatoes and a beet salad or pickled
beets. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-02-95
