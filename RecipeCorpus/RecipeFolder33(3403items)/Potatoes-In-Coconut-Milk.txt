Recipe by: Practical Thai Cooking, by Schmitz & Worman Peel the
potatoes and slice them into thick rounds. Boil them until they are
almost half done, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat and brown the garlic.
Add the flour water mixture  to the garlic with the coconut milk.
Continue to cook and stir until thickened. Season the coconut white
sauce with pepper and salt.  If it seems thicker than a conventional
white sauce, add a little water to thin it down. Add the potatoes and
stir until they are thoroughly coated.  Put the potatoes and sauce in
a casserole and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake at 350 for 30
minutes or until lightly browned.

Tastes good with onion bits sprinkled on top before serving.
