Title: Bill's Navy Bean Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Navy beans
2    Celery stalks
2    Carrots
1/2    Onion
2    Ham hocks
Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper
3 tb Margarine
3 tb All-purpose flour
1. Pick over the dried beans and discard any debris. Wash and drain.
Put beans in a large pot and cover with water. Let stand 8 hours or
overnight. 2. The next day, chop celery, carrots and onions into
1/4-inch pieces. (This is easier with a food processor.) Drain beans.
Add vegetables, 5 cups water, ham hocks or ham bone, and pepper to
taste. Add salt if you wish. Bring to a simmer and cook over low heat
for 3 hours or until beans are tender. 3. Remove ham hocks and set
aside to cool. Remove meat from bones and cut meat into half-inch
pieces. 4. Put 2 cups of the soup into a blender along with the
margarine and flour; puree. Pour this puree back in pan. Puree more
of the soup if you prefer a smoother texture. Add the chopped ham
pieces back into the soup. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until soup is
slightly thickened.

Yield: 6-8 large servings. This soup is especially good when
sprinkled with a few drops of hot pepper sauce just before serving.
