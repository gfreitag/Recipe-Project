Title: Parlies  or Scottish Parliament Cakes
Categories: Scot/irish, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 batch
8 oz Flour
4 oz Butter
2 oz Caster sugar
2 tb Golden syrup
. *or* black treacle
1 ts Ginger; ground
Set oven to 350Ã¸F or Mark 4.  Grease a baking tray. Cream together the
butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add the flour, the egg and the
syrup (together with the ginger, if required.) Beat well.
Alternatively, put all the in gredients in a blender and mix well but
ensure that they are at room temperature.  Drop dessertspoonfuls onto
the baking tray leaving room for them to expand. Bake for 15-20
minutes until light golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool.

Originally black treacle would have been used in this recipe.

A delicious cross between a cake and a biscuit. (Remember that in
Scotland a biscuit is what we in the New World call a cookie.)
