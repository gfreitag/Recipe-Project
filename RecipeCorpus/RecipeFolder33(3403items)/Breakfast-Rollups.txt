Title: Breakfast Rollups
Categories: Breakfast, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
12    Sausage links
2 c  Pancake mix
2 c  Milk
1    Egg
2 tb Margarine -- melted
2    Apples -- grated
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon -- optional
* Use 12 precooked sausage links; either turkey, pork, or beef.

1. Use a heavy skillet. Do not preheat. Place sausage links in cold
skillet, turn heat to low and cook, turning links several times. Turn
heat to medium and continue cooking links until they are thoroughly
cooked and brown. Drain and keep links warm. 2. To prepare pancakes,
combine pancake mix, egg and milk. Blend until smooth, adding a bit
more milk if necessary to make a thin batter. Add in the melted
margarine, grated apples and cinnamon; blend well. 3. Using a heavy
griddle, preheat; with a paper towel rub a tiny bit of oil onto hot
griddle. Pour batter, making 4-inch circles. Cook until bubbles
appear and bottom is slightly browned when edge is lifted. Turn
pancakes over and cook on other side until browned. 4. Roll one
sausage link in each pancake, place seam side down on serving plate.
Serve immediately with maple syrup, or use a topping of applesauce
and sour cream. For a different taste, try using yogurt as a topping.
