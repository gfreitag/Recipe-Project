3 lb Small pork ribs
1 ea Part paprika
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 ea Pt catsup
1/3 c  Flour
4 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Black pepper
1 tb Prepared mustard
1 c  Worcestershire sauce
1 ea Part black pepper
3 ea Parts salt
1 1/2 ea Pt water
1 tb Salt
2 1/2 ts Paprika
1 1/2 ts Chili powder
1 1/2 ts Liquid Smoke
Season the slab of pork ribs on both sides with the above mixture.
Place ribs on the grill in any type of covered smoker or barbecue
pit, keeping away from direct heat so that the smoke does the
cooking. Cook very slowly for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until meat comes
away from the bone easily. During the final 15 minutes of cooking,
baste both sides of the meat with barbecue sauce. Cut ribs to serve.
To make sauce, combine catsup and water in large pot. Bring to a
boil. Mix dry ingredients together. Add mustard, Liquid Smoke, and
half of the Worcestershire sauce. Stir into a paste; then add
remainder of Worcestershire sauce. Pour this into heated mixture and
boil slowly for 20 minutes. Refrigerate any unused portion. Keeps for
several weeks. Sauce makes about one quart.
