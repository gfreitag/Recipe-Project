Title: Aromatic Oil
Categories: Newspaper, Salsa/sauce, Herbs/spice
Yield: 5 cups
4 c  Canola oil
1 c  Olive oil
2    Sprigs basil
2    Sprigs tarragon
2    Sprigs dill
2    Sprigs rosemary
8    Peppercorns
4 cl Garlic; peeled
2    Bay leaves
4    Allspice; whole
Put all ingredients in large pot over medium heat.  When you see
bubbles drift up from the bottom, turn the heat very low and simmer
for 2 hours. Strain into clean, fancy bottles through a fine-meshed
sieve lined with multiple layers of cheesecloth.  Seal.  Store in a
cool, dark place. Label and decorate.

NOTE:  If you substitute thoroughly dried herbs for the fresh and
omit the garlic, you can sun-steep the oil.  Place the oil and dried
herbs in a large, clean jar and seal.  Leave in the hot sun for 4 to
6 hours to draw out the flavor of herbs.  Cool and store in a cool
dark place until ready to deliver (1 to 3 months).  Decant into 2
clean, fancy bottles. Label and decorate.
