Categories: Cheese/eggs, Pasta/rice
Yield: 8 servings
15 oz Ricotta cheese, part skim
Milk
1 c  Monterey jack cheese --
Shredded
2 c  Mozzarella cheese, part skim
Milk -- shredded
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
2    Eggs -- beaten
10 oz Frozen spinach
1 ds Salt
1 ds Black pepper
1/2 lb Pasta shells -- jumbo
30 oz Marinara sauce
1 ds Ground nutmeg -- optional
1. Thaw the spinach, chop, and drain very well. 2. Combine the
ricotta, jack, Parmesan cheese and 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese.
Add the beaten eggs, spinach, salt and pepper. Add the dash of nutmeg
if using. Set aside. 3. Cook pasta according to the package and drain
well. 4. Fill the drained and cooled pasta shells with the cheese

large enough to hold the filled shells in one layer. Pour remaining
sauce evenly over shells; sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella
cheese over top of shells. 5. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for
about 30 minutes.
