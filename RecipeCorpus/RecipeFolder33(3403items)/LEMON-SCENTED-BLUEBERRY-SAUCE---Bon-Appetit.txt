Title: LEMON-SCENTED BLUEBERRY SAUCE - Bon Appetit
Categories: Bon appetit, Salsa/sauce, Fruit
Yield: 2 1/4 cups
1 lb Fresh or frozen blueberries
1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 ts Cornstarch
1 1/2 ts Grated lemon peel
Combine all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium
heat until cornstarch dissolves. Boil until thickened, stirring
occasionally, about 4 minutes.

Cover and refrigerate until cold. (Can be made 3 days ahead-keep
chilled.)

NOTE:  This versatile sauce can be used to top ice cream or
cheesecake, or to make blueberry shortcake (simply layer it with
whipped cream and sliced pound cake).  Try the sauce warm over
pancakes, too.
