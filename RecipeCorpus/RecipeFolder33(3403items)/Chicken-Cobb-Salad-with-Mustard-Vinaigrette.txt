Drain; cool. Cut into halves or quarters depending on the size of the
potatoes. Put them in a large bowl and set aside. Lay the bacon
slices in a single layer on a jelly roll pan. Bake in a 350'F. oven
until crisp, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Crumble and add
to the potatoes.

wine, stock or a combination of all three. Season with salt and
pepper. Poach in the simmering liquid for 7 minutes. Turn chicken
over. Continue cooking until the chicken is just white throughout and
springy to the touch. Remove from liquid. Cool to room temperature.
Cut into 1/4" julienne strips. Add the chicken strips to the potatoes.
