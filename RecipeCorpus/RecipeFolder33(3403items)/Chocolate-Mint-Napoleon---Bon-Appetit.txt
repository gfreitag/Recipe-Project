FOR MOUSSE: Whisk yolks and 1/4 C sugar in small bowl to blend. Bring
1/4 C cream to simmer in heavy small saucepan. Gradually whisk hot
cream into egg mixture. Return mixture to same saucepan. Stir
constantly over medium low heat until custard thickens, about 1
minute (do not boil). Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate, creme de
cacao and butter and stir until smooth. Pour into large bowl. Chill
until cool, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Beat 1/2 C cream
in small bowl to stiff peaks. Fold cream into chocolate mixture.
Cover and chill.

FOR CHOCOLATE BARK: Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Finely
grind mints in processor. Place half of chocolate in top of double
boiler set over simmering water. Stir until candy thermometer
registers 115'F. Pour onto 1 prepared sheet. Using spatula, spread
chocolate to 1/16 inch thickness over parchment. Sprinkle half of
ground candies over half of chocolate. Fold parchment in half to seal
candies in chocolate. Repeat with remaining chocolate and candies.
Cover and chill 1 to 24 hours.

Peel parchment off chocolate bark. Break or cut each sheet of bark
into 6 large irregular pieces, reserving any small pieces for
