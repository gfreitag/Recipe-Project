Title: Fruit And Vegetable Fritters
Categories: Fruit, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
14 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs
2 ts Sugar -- * see note
2/3 c  Milk
1 ts Salad oil
1/2 ts Lemon juice
Mixed fruit
Mixed vegetables
* If you are preparing vegetable fritters, omit the sugar. For a
thinner coating, add more milk and omit baking powder. For a fluffier
coating, beat egg whites separately and add to batter last.

1. Sift flour, baking powder and salt together. 2. Beat the eggs until
light and fluffy. Add sugar, milk, oil and dash of lemon juice; add
flour mixture and stir only long enough to dampen. Add a dash of
cinnamon to the flour when making fruit fritters. 3. Prepare fritters.

FRUIT: Apples: Peel, core and cut in 1/2-inch slices. Bananas: Cut
into chunks and sprinkle with lemon juice and sugar. Use canned
peaches, pineapple etc. by draining; sprinkle very lightly with flour
before dipping into batter.

VEGETABLES: Cut into equal-sized pieces to keep frying time
approximately the same.

4. Heat oil in deep skillet or container until about 370 degrees. Cook
fritters until delicately brown, then drain on paper towels. Exact
times will vary. Test one  piece of fruit or vegetable to get an idea
of how long to cook. If batter does not cling well enough, add a bit
more flour. A very important point to remember is to have the oil hot
enough and keep it at the same temperature throughout cooking.
