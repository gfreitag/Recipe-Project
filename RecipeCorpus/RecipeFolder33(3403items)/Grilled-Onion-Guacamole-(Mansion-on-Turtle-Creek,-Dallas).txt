Title: Grilled Onion Guacamole (Mansion on Turtle Creek, Dallas)
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables, Salads
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Veg. oil
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1 ts Pepper, freshly milled
1 ts Cumin ground
3/4 ts Salt plus more to taste
1    Red onion large
3    Avocados
1    Tomato large
2    Garlic cloves
3    Serrano chilies
3 tb Cilantro, chopped
Lime juice, fresh, to taste
In a small bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, ground pepper,
cumin and 3/4 teaspoon salt.  Place this marinade in a shallow dish.
Slice the onion into 1/4 inch thick slices, add to the marinade, and
let sit for an hour.  Heat a grill until quite hot.  Drain the liquid
from the onion and place on the grill, about 3 minutes a side.
Coarsely chop the grilled onion.

Peel, seed, and cut the avocado into 1/2" dice (do not mash - the
object here is to allow the vegetables to keep their identity, bound
by the other flavours).  Seed and finely chop the chillies; finely
chop the garlic, dice the tomato, combine these with the avocado,
chopped onion, cilantro and season to taste with salt and lime juice.
Keep at room temperature until ready to serve.
