Title: Strawberry Cheesecake Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM-----------------------PIE CRUST--------------------------------
2 c  Unbleached flour
1/3 c  Oil
1/4 c  Water -- ice cold
MMMMM------------------------FILLING---------------------------------
1 pk Fat-free cream cheese -- (8
Oz) softened
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Lemon peel -- grated
2 tb Lemon juice
4 c  Fresh strawberries --
Sliced
2 pk Frozen strawberries --
Mashed
1/4 c  Cornstarch
Preheat oven at 350.  To prepare crust, prepare a 9" pie pan with
cooking spray and flour.  Place flour in a bowl and drizzle with oil.
Use a pastry blender to evenly distribute the oil and produce a
mixture the consistency of coarse cornmeal.  Sprinkle on the water, 1
tablespoon at a time, and continue mixing until you can gather the
dough into a ball. Roll the dough into a 11" circle onto a floured
surface.  Patch any cracks that may form, but otherwise try not to
handle the dough more than necessary. Transfer the dough to prepared
pie pan.  Trim the dough, leaving a 1" overhang. Crimp the
overhanging dough into a decorative edge. Chill the crust 20 minutes.
To prepare filling, in a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup
sugar, lemon peel, and juice until creamy. Spread mixture into pie
shell and top with fresh strawberries.  In a saucepan, cook frozen
strawberries, remaining sugar, and cornstarch until bubbly then cook
two minutes more. Cool completely; pour over strawberries in pie
shell. Chill.
