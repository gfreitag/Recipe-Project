CHOCOLATE:  ITS CARE & HANDLING

It's no surprise that chocolate is America's favorite flavor.
However, as a natural product made principally from cocoa beans,
chocolate does have certain characteristics that affect the way it
should be stored and used for best results.

STORING CHOCOLATE:  The key words are COOL, DRY, AND LOW HUMIDITY!
Storage temperature should be between 60 degrees and 78 degrees F.
with relative humidity at less than 50 %.  It is all right to
refrigerate chocolate, but wrap it tightly so that it won't absorb
odors. Airtight wrapping will also prevent moisture from condensing
on the chocolate when it is removed from the refrigerator.  Chocolate
becomes hard and brittle when cold, so allow it to come to room
temperature before using.

A TIP ABOUT MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS:  Don't use milk chocolate chips
in desserts that do not call for melting the chips before blending
them in. The milk content causes them to become hard when they are
baked. You may substitute milk chocolate chips for semi-sweet chips
in recipes such as frostings or sauces that call for melting the
chips.

THERE'S NO LOVE IN "BLOOM," BUT NO HARM EITHER:  Chocolate has a
high content of cocoa butter.  When stored at temperatures that
fluctuate from hot to cold, chocolate can develop "bloom"--a gray
film caused by the cocoa butter rising to the surface.  This dulls
the rich brown chocolate color but does not affect the flavor.  When
the chocolate melts, it regains its attractive color. Don't hesitate
to use it.

MELTING CHOCOLATE PERFECTLY:

IMPORTANT REMINDER:  Even the smallest drop of moisture from a wet
spoon or steam from a double boiler can cause melted chocolate to
become lumpy. If this occurs, all is not lost.  Stir in 1 T vegetable
shortening (not butter) for every 3 ounces of chocolate.  Butter is
not used because it contains water.  Stir continuously until the
consistency is smooth and even.

TOP OF STOVE METHOD:  All varieties of chips can be melted using
this traditional method.  Place the amount of chips you want to melt
in the top of a clean, dry, double boiler.  Place over hot (not
boiling) water, stirring occasionally until smooth.  Note: water in
bottom pan should be 1 inch below top pan for best results.

MICROWAVE METHOD:  All varieties of chips can be melted using a
microwave oven.  Simply place the amount of chips you want to melt in
a dry, glass measuring cup twice the size (i.e. to melt 1 cup of
chips, use a 2 cup measuring cup).  Microwave on HIGH for 1 minute;
stir. Microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds longer; stir.  It is necessary
to stir the chips because they retain their original shape even in
the melted state. Because microwave ovens may differ in power levels,
consul your "User's Guide" for specific directions for your
particular model.
