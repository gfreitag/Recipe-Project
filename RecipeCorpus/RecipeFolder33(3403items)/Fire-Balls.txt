Title: Fire Balls
Categories: Appetizers, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
12 oz Jalapeno peppers, canned
1 c  Buttermilk baking mix
6 oz Mozzarella cheese --
Shredded
1 lb Sausage
6 oz Seasoned bread crumbs
* Use a spicy breading mix made for pork or for less spicy dish use
unseasoned fine dry bread crumbs. A mixture of pork breading crumbs
and plain crumbs is good to use.

1. Cut off stem ends and remove seeds from the peppers. Rinse peppers
to remove seeds, but allow some seeds to remain if you like them
hotter.

2. Stuff peppers lightly with cheese, then set aside.

3. Thoroughly mix sausage, biscuit mix, and remaining cheese. Make
small patties from the mixture. Place a pepper in the center of each
patty, then wrap and seal the dough around the pepper. Coat one or
two balls at a time by shaking them in a plastic bag with the pork
breading mix or seasoning of your choice.

4. Using a lightly greased skillet, brown sausage balls until the
sausage is thoroughly cooked, turning several times.
