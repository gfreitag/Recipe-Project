Title: Grilled Rice Cakes
Categories: Bbq/grill, Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 c  Water
Salt
1 1/2 c  Short-grain rice
1 tb Seasoned rice vinegar or
-sherry vinegar
Description:

The key here is using starchier short-grained rice to ensure that it
holds together.  As an alternative, you can add chopped mushrooms
(shitake or common) to the rice mixture before chilling to set.
Extra teriyaki sauce from the yakitori can be drizzled over just
before serving.

Instructions:

Brink the water and a generous pinch of salt to a boil in a medium
saucepan.  Stir in the rice, lower the heat and cook, covered, over
medium-low until the rice has absorbed all the liquid, about 18
minutes. Stir the rice every 5 minutes or so, to help release the
starch and promote stickiness.

When cooked, take the rice from the heat and stir in the rice
vinegar.  Let cool to tepid, stirring occasionally; taste for
seasoning.  Spoon the rice mixture into a lightly oiled 9-inch square
or round cake pan. With wet or lightly oil hands, press the rice down
evenly into the pan. Chill until firm.

Preheat the grill.

Turn the set rice onto a cutting board and cut into 12 even shapes
(squares, triangles, wedges).  Lightly brush the grill with oil and
add rice cakes.  Grill until nicely colored, 1 to 2 minutes, then
turn and grill 1 to 2 minutes more.  Serve immediately.
