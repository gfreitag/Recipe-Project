Title: Pork Chops W/capers
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
4 1/2 lb Pork chops
Pepper freshly ground
1 ts Vegetable oil
1/3 c  Capers, drained
3/4 c  Onions, chopped
2 ts Garlic, chopped
2 tb White wine vinegar
3/4 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Tomato, diced
1 tb Dijon mustard
1 tb Parsley leaves chopped
Sprinkle the chops with pepper. Heat the oil in a nonstick frying
pan. When the oil is very hot, put the chops in it. Brown them well
on each side, about 5 minutes a side. Lower the heat. Let the chops
cook through, about another 20 minutes. Turn the chops frequently as
they cook. Remove the chops to a warm platter. Cover them to keep
them warm. Discard all the fat in the pan. Add the capers to the pan.
Saute briefly. Add the onion. Saute the onions. Stir the capers and
onions together. Brown slightly. Add the garlic. Saute briefly. Add
the vinegar. Stir to dissolve any meat particles in the pan. Add the
stock and tomato and any liquid accumulated around the chops. Allow
the sauce to boil vigorously until most of the moisture has
evaporated. Stir in the mustard. Pour the mixture over the chops
immediately. Garnish with the chopped parsley.
