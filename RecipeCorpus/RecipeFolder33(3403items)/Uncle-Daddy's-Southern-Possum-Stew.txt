Title: Uncle Daddy's Southern Possum Stew
Categories: Soup/stew, Game, Potatoes
Yield: 1 servings
Possum
Dumplings
Sweet potatoes
Onions
Salt
After hunting with a lantern in your hand all night, take the possum
you have bagged and break his neck by putting your foot on the
possum's head and pulling up on his tail.  Use boiling water to scald
Brother Possum. In a large pan, dress the animal by pulling out those
hairs on him. When all is well done, cut Brother Possum into four
parts. Add salt and boil the meat until tender.  Make your dumplings
and add them slowly to the boiling meat.  After the possum has boiled
about an hour, put the parts into a baking dish. Peel sweet potatoes
and slice them thick. Place the slices in the pan around the pieces
of possum. Add onions if desired. Bake for 1 hour.  This is a Sunday
dinner for 12 people with the dumplings. Submitted By JENNY EUWINE
