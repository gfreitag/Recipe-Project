Title: Marc's High Fiber Energy Bars
Categories: Breakfast, Snacks
Yield: 48 servings
2 c  Dried prunes -- pitted
2/3 c  Orange juice
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
3/4 c  Margarine -- soft
3/4 c  Packed brown sugar
1/4 c  Honey
1    Egg
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
1/4 c  Wheat germ
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
* Substitute 1/2 cup dried apricots for half of the prunes if desired.
Fiber content will remain about the same.

1. Combine prunes (and apricots if using) with the orange juice in a
blender. Blend until almost smooth, scrapping down the sides of the
blender a few times. Stir in the nuts; set mixture aside. 2. In a
large bowl, cream the margarine, sugar and honey. Beat in the egg.
Mix in flour, oats, wheat germ, baking soda and salt to blend
thoroughly. 3. Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Spread a little less
than half of the flour mixture evenly in the pan. Spread the prune
mixture evenly over the mixture in pan, keeping the prune mixture to
within 1/2 inch of the edges. Crumble the remaining flour mixture
over the top to cover the prune mixture. Pat down gently. 4. Bake in
a preheated 350-degree oven 30-35 minutes or until browned and
springs back to the touch. 5. Cool on wire rack. Cut into bars about
1 by 2 inches each.

Yield: 48 bars.
