1    Stick butter
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  White sugar
1    Egg, beaten
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Nutmeg
pn Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 c  Granola
1/4 c  Chopped pecans
In large bowl, cream butter and sugars. When blended, beat in the
egg. Add the flour, nutmeg, salt and baking powder and stir well. Add
granola and nuts. The dough will be quite soft. Put it in the
refrigerator to chill for about half an hour and preheat the oven to

Remove dough from refrigerator, pull off golf-ball-size lumps and roll
lightly between your palms to form balls. Place on cookie sheet,
flatten slightly and bake about 10 minutes, until edges are brown.
