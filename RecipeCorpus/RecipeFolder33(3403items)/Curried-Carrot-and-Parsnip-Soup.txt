Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 md Onion, coarsely chopped
1 tb Curry powder
1 1/2 lb Carrots, cut into 1/4"
-rounds
1 lb Parsnips, cut into 1/4"

8 c  Vegetable broth

2    Plum tomatoes, seeded and
-cut into 1/4" dice
2 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley
Add curry powder to the wilted onion and cook for 1 minute before
adding the broth to mellow its flavor. Cover the soup as it cooks, so
the broth doesn't evaorate.

1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
onion and cook until wilted, about 10-12 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Add the curry powder and cook 1 minute, stirring well.

2. Add the carrots, parsnips and broth. Raise the heat and bring soup
to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, for 30 minutes or
until the vegetables are tender.

3. Cool the soup slightly, then puree it in batches in a food
processor or blender until smooth. Return soup to the pot, season to
taste with salt and pepper, then heat through.

4. To serve, ladle into shallow bowls, dollop with yogurt and
sprinkle with diced tomatoes and chopped parsley.
