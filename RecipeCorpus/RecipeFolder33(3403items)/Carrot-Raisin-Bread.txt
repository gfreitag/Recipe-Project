Title: Carrot-Raisin Bread
Categories: Breads, Breadmaker
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/4 ts Fermipan or Red Star dry
-yeast
3 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Oat bran (optional)
1 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder (or
-more for extra protein)
2 tb Canola oil
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Carrot pulp from the juicer
-(at room temp.)
1 c  Tepid water
3/4 c  Raisins, added at the "beep"
Process on white bread setting. I prefer to start the machine with
only part of the water added, then add the rest in a slow drizzle
while it is running. That helps assure that I don't add too much
water if the weather is humid or the pulp moister than usual.

I developed these recipes for my aging Welbilt. Your results may vary
