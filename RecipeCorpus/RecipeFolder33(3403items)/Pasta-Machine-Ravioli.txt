Title: Pasta Machine Ravioli
Categories: Italian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 36 medium dum
3 c  Flour - all-purpose
3    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Water
Combine flour, eggs and salt in a processor and mix well. With machine
running, add just enough water through the feed tube to form a ball.
Remove the ball from the processor. Cover dough and let rest 30 min.
Cut dough into 4 quarters. Flatten 1 piece at a time leaving the
remainder covered, then fold in thirds. Turn pasta machine to widest
setting and run the dough through several times until smooth and
velvety, folding before each run and dusting with flour if sticky.
Adjust machine to next narrower setting. Run dough through machine
without folding. Repeat, narrowing rollers after each run, until
pasta is 1/8" thick, dusting with flour if necessary. Line baking
sheets with towels. Set sheet of dough on work surface. Place about
1-1/2 tsp of a filling at 2" intervals along sheet. Roll second piece
of dough and set it on top of first sheet. Press down around filling
to seal the dough. Cut into 2-inch squares. Arrange on prepared
sheets. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.  Cover with towel
and let stand 1/2 hr. Cook ravioli in a large pot of boiling, salted
water until just tender but still firm to bite, about 8 min. Remove
with a slotted spoon and drain. Place on a warm platter, add the
sauce and serve. Submitted By BOBBI ZEE   On   07-29-95
