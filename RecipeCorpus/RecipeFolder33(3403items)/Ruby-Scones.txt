Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 8 servings
1    Maraschino cherries
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Butter
1    Egg
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Flaked coconut
1 ts Crystallized ginger
1 c  Confectioners' sugar
1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 2. Drain cherries, reserving 2
tablespoons juice.  Cut cherries into quarters; set aside. 3. In a
large mixing bowl, combine flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and
salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 4. Beat
together egg and buttermilk.  Add egg mixture, coconut, ginger and
drained cherries to flour mixture, stirring with a fork only until
combined. 5. Lightly knead on a floured surface 12 times.  Pat or
lightly roll dough to 1/2-inch thickness. 6.  Cut dough into 8
pieces, using a floured, 4-inch round biscuit cutter. Place rounds on
an ungreased baking sheet. 7. Using a sharp, floured knife, cut each
scone into four wedges.  Do not separate. Bake in a preheated 400
degree oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until light golden brown. 8. In a
small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and reserved maraschino
cherry juice; mix well.  Drizzle glaze over hot scones.  Serve warm.
