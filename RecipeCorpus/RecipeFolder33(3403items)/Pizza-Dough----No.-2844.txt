Title: Pizza Dough    No. 2844
Categories: Italian, Pizza, Breads
Yield: 1 8" pie
2 pk Instant Dry Yeast
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk, At Room Temp.
3 c  Unbleached Flour
3/4 c  Warm Water
Dissolve the yeast in a mixture of the warm (125 degrees) water and
room temperature milk in a large bowl. Mix in the flour and salt to
make a soft dough. Knead (10 minutes by hand -- 4 minutes in a heavy
duty mixer with a dough hook). Oil a clean bowl. Set the dough in the
bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in bulk
(about 2 hours in a warm place). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Divide into equal parts (one per 8" pizza). Roll each part out to an
8" diameter. Top with the desired sauce and toppings. Bake for 10
minutes. From: JOEL EHRLICH Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   07-26-95
