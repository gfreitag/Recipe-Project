Title: Baked Salmon on a Bed of Leeks
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
4 md Leeks, about 1 1/2 lb
4    Salmon fillets, 6-8 oz each
4 tb Lime juice
4 tb Olive oil
4 ts Honey
1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
-to taste
2 tb Fresh snipped chives, for
-garnish
2    Limes, halved, for garnish
When there's citrus juice in a marinade, it is important not to let
the fish sit longer than 30 minutes, because the citrus will "cook"
the fish.

1. Trim the leeks, leaving 3" of green on. Cut the leeks into
juliennes (very thin strips, about 4" by 1/8"). Wash well in a
strainer to remove all dirt. Blanch in boiling, salted water for 2
minutes; drain.

2. Preheat the oven to 450'F.

3. Place the salmon fillets in a glass or ceramic dish to fit. For
marinade, combine 2 tablespoons lime juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil,
the honey, ginger, salt and pepper. Pour over salmon and refrigerate,
covered, for 30 minutes.

4. While salmon marinates, toss the leeks with the remaining lime
juice, up to 3 tablespoons of olive oil (use less oil, if desired),
and salt and pepper to taste. Place in a 9x12" oven-to-table dish.

5. Remove the salmon from the marinade and place on top of the leeks,
skin-side down. Bake until cooked through, about 15 minutes, or until
the salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve immediately,
sprinkled with chives and garnished with lime halves.
