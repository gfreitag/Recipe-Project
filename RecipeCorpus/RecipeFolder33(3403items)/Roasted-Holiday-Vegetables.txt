These vegetables should be tender yet still have bite. As they tend
to be hard, it is necessary first to soften them by steaming. For
convenience, steam the vegetables ahead of time, then roast them just
before serving.

1. Preheat oven to 450'F.

2. Steam vegetables separately (do beets last) until tender, about 10
minutes for each; remove to a bowl.

3. Gently toss the vegetables with olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper.
(Do not overtoss, lest the beets bleed; just shake the bowl.)

4. Place the vegetables in one layer on two large baking sheets and
bake for 30 minutes or until nicely colored and fork-tender, shaking
occasionally. Serve in the center of the Crown Roast of Pork; serve
any extra vegetables in bowls around the serving platter.
