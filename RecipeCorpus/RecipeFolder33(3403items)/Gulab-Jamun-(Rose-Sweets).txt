Essence
Sift milk powder, flour, bicarbonate of soda and ground cardamom into
large bowl. Rob in butter or ghee, then add enough water to give a
firm but pliable dough which can be moulded into balls the size of
large marble, or into small sausage shapes.

Fry slowly in hot ghee until they turn the colour of unblanched
almonds. The frying must be done overgentle heat. Drain on absorbent
paper.

Have ready the syrup, made by combining, sugar, water and cardamom
pods and heating until sugar is dissolved. Put the fried gulab jamun
into the syrup and soak until they are almost double in size, and
soft and spongy. Add rose water when they have cooled slightly. Allow
to cool completely and serve at room temperature or slightly chilled.
