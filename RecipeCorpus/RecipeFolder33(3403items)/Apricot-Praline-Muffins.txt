Title: Apricot-Praline Muffins
Categories: Muffins
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 c  Pecan halves -- chopped
1/2 c  Margarine -- melted
1/2 c  Dried apricots
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
1 ts Ground cinnamon
2 c  Biscuit mix
2/3 c  Milk
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan.

1. Fit the steel knife blade into the work bowl. Process the pecans
until chopped into 1/8-inch pieces. Distribute chopped pecans evenly
in muffin cups. Put 2 teaspoons melted margarine in each cup. 2. With
the steel knife blade still attached, process apricots until chopped
into 1/4-inch pieces. Add brown sugar, cinnamon, biscuit mix and
milk. Process until batter is well mixed, 10-15 seconds, stopping
machine once to scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Pieces
of apricots should still be visible. 3. Drop by spoonfuls into muffin
cups. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center of a muffin comes
out clean, about 15 minutes. Do not push pick all the way to bottom.
Remove from oven and invert muffin pan on a serving plate. DO NOT
remove pan; let stand 10 minutes so pecans and margarine will drop
down onto muffins.

Yield: 12 muffins.
