This is a fairly heavy, moist bread that's not as sweet as the
ingredients might suggest.  The fruit and granola combine to make a
slightly nutty taste with a hint of banana.  This bread makes
terrific toast with a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs.

Success Hints
-------------

Mash bananas well or use a food processor; measure after mashing.

Use the regular or rapid bake cycle.
