Title: Creamy Spinach Sauce for Pasta
Categories: Vegetarian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Olive oil
1 md Onion -- chopped
4    Cloves garlic -- minced
10 oz Frozen spinach
1 ts Dried parsley
1 ts Dried oregano
Juice of 1/2 lemon
3/4 c  Nonfat cottage cheese
1/4 c  Skim milk
Salt and pepper -- to taste
Heat a skillet, then add the oil.  Coat the skillet, then toss in the
onions and garlic.  Saute about 2-3 minutes, then place the frozen
spinach in the center and cover the skillet.  Reduce heat and cook
about 10 mins., checking occasionally to break up spinach, until
spinach is completely cooked.  Meanwhile, put the remaining
ingredients in a food processor or blender and process until smooth.
Pour into a saucepan and cook on low heat until it begins to boil.
Reduce heat immediately and stir in 2 Tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 2
Tbsp milk and cook, stirring, until mixture is thick. Remove from
heat and stir into spinach mixture. Serve over elbows or rotelli.
