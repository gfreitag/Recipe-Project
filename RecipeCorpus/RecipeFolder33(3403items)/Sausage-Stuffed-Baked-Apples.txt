Categories: Fruit, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Sausage
2 tb Yellow onions -- minced
3 tb Packed brown sugar
1    Garlic clove -- minced
8    Bacon slices
8    Green apples -- baking type
* Use all ground bulk sausage or a combination of bulk and mild to hot
Italian sausage. If using hot Italian sausage, you may wish to omit
the garlic.

Brown sausage, add garlic and onion. Stir for 3-4 minutes until onion
begins to turn light brown and is softened. Drain the mixture
thoroughly. Wash and core but do not peel the apples. Stuff the cored
apples with the sausage mixture. Sprinkle with brown sugar and top
with the bacon slices which have been chopped into small pieces. Put
into an oven-safe baking dish and bake at 350 degrees for about 40-45
minutes or until apples are soft.
