Title: Steaming Hot Holiday Punch
Categories: Beverages, Crockpot
Yield: 20 servings
3 c  Apple juice
3 c  Orange juice
6 c  Cranberry juice cocktail
3/4 c  Maple syrup
2 ts Powdered sugar
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
3/4 ts Ground cloves
3/4 ts Ground nutmeg
Cinnamon sticks -- *see
Note
* Cinnamon sticks are optional but make a very pretty addition as
stirrers in steaming hot mugs of punch.

Combine all the ingredients in a very large heavy pan, except the
cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil and turn to simmer for few minutes.
You can put the ingredients in a crockpot after it has boiled and
keep warm over low heat.

This recipe can be easily doubled or halved.
