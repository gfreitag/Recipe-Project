If you are a meat-and-potatoes kind of person, this is the bread for
you. Just add butter and you have a potato loaf with all the
trimmings! The velvety texture and rich flavor make this bread a
wonderful companion to roasts, and a natural for meatloaf sandwiches.
Served warm, it turns a bowl of vegetable beef soup into a memorable
meal.

Success Hints
-------------

The dough will be very dry; resist the urge to add water.

For best flavor, use real bacon bits.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
