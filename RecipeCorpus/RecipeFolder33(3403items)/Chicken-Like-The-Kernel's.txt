"Chicken Like `The Kernel's'

Begin with about 3 lbs fryer parts. Cut the breast pieces in half.
Fries quickly when the pieces are small.

Make a paste of the following:

Spread this paste evenly over chicken pieces; stack in a bowl; cover
and refrigerate at least two hours or better yet, overnight. About 1
hour before serving, heat about 1 1/2 pints cooking oil in heavy
saucepan (9 inches in diameter, with depth of oil about 3 inches) to
a temperature of 425 degrees.

I prefer my Oster Super Cooker--but using an electric deep fryer I
would have the temperature at 400 degrees. Put about 2 cups milk or
Club Soda or beer in a deep, narrow bowl & dip each piece chicken in
the liquid, letting the excess drip off. Dust lightly but evenly in
Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour (or a good brand). DO NOT OVERCOAT!!! Dry
pieces a few minutes without letting them touch each other. Fry few
pieces at a time. Place on a cookie sheet without letting them touch
each other and bake uncovered 350 degrees 30 minutes. Serves about 6
to 8 people.

I encourage you to experiment with amount of salad dressing mix
according to your own taste preferences. But much of it washes off in
milk so 2 pkgs needed!

Cracklin Good Gravy Blend till smooth 1 c water & 1/4 cup cornstarch
(in blender). In sauce pan over medium heat combine this with 10-oz
can Banquet Chicken Broth or home made stock, 2 chicken bouillon
cubes, two (10-oz ea) cans Franco American Beef Gravy. Stir until
thick & clear. Serve over chicken, thoroughly heated. Serves 6
nicely. A PINCH of sage to this does wonders for flavor. Bouillon
powder may be substituted for the cubes if you wish."
