Title: Cinnamon-Honey Popcorn
Categories: Holiday, Snacks
Yield: 8 servings
10 c  Popcorn, air-popped -- * see
Note
1/3 c  Honey
1 c  Peanuts, oil-roasted
1 ts Orange zest
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon -- ** see
Note
4 tb Margarine -- solid
* About 1/2 cup corn unpopped; exact measurements are not required
for this recipe. ** If you prefer, use another spice instead of
cinnamon. Try nutmeg and allspice, or pumpkin pie spice.

In a very large bowl or pan, mix popped corn and peanuts. In a small
pan, mix the margarine, honey, orange zest and cinnamon. Heat,
stirring, until the margarine is melted. With a wooden spoon or
spatula in one hand, slowly pour this mixture over popcorn, tossing
and mixing lightly as you pour. Place on a large cookie sheet, trying
to layer as thinly as possible. Roast at 325 degrees, turning the
popcorn every 5 minutes. When crispy, transfer to a platter and cool
to room temperature. Do not overcook. May be stored in popcorn can or
container at this point.
