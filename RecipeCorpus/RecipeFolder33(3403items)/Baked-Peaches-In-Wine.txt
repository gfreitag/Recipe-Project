where you removed the pits. 2. Grease a baking dish generously with 2
tablespoons butter or solid margarine. Use a dish that can also be
taken to the table for serving the peaches when cooked. 3. Lay
peaches, cut side up, in baking dish. 4. In a mixing bowl, mix the
cake or cookie crumbs, scooped out centers of peaches, 1/4 cup melted

crumb mixture and sprinkle the wine on top. 6. Bake in preheated
350-degree oven for 30 minutes, basting frequently with juices in
pan. Let set 5 minutes and serve.
