For best results, be careful not to overcook shrimp, because they will
toughen. It's difficult when judging cooking time, because shrimp
vary so greatly in size. For constant success, be sure to try one as
they cook; you'll get the feel of it soon enough.

1. Peel and devein shrimp, leaving the tails on. Rinse and pat dry.

2. For marinade, combine the oil, wine, garlic, paprika, pepper
flakes, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon parsley in a large bowl. Add
the shrimp and toss well. Refrigerate, covered, for 1 hour.

3. Thread about 4-6 shrimp, crosswise, on each of 6 skewer. Grill 3"
from high heat source, brushing with and remaining marinade. Cook 3-4
minutes per side or until cooked through. (Do not overcook, or the
shrimp will be tough.)

4. Serve the skewer on a large platter, sprinkled with the remaining
parsley, with lemon halves alongside.
