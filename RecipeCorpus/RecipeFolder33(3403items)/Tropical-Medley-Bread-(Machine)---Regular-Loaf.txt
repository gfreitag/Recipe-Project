This is a light, colorful bread full of fruity surprises.  Because of
the variety in the dried fruit mix, each bite has a different flavor!

Success Hints
-------------

Apricots, coconut, golden raisins, papaya and pineapple make a good
combination for the dried fruit mix

Several brands of pre-chopped and pre-packaged "Tropical Medley" mix
are available - great for fast preparation.

You don't need to use the fruit & nut cycle; simply add the dried
fruit with your other ingredients.

This recipe can be made with the regular, rapid or delayed time bake
cycles.
