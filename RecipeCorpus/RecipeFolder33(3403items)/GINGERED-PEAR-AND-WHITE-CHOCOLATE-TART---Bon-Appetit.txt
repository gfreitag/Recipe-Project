FOR CRUST: Preheat oven to 350F. Butter 9-inch diameter tart pan with
removable bottom. Finely grind 1 1/3 C ground cookies and ginger in
processor. Transfer to bowl. Blend in sesame seeds and butter. Press
crust onto bottom and up sides of prepared pan. Bake until crust
sets, about 10 minutes. Cool.

FOR FILLING: Sprinkle gelatin over water in small saucepan. Let stand
5 minutes to soften. Stir over low heat until gelatin dissolves; set
aside. Bring 1/3 C cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Reduce
heat to low and add white chocolate; stir until smooth. Remove from
heat. Stir in gelatin and ginger. Refrigerate just until cool,
stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Beat remaining 1/4 C cream and creme fraiche in small bowl to soft
peaks. Fold cream mixture into white chocolate mixture. Spoon filling
into crust. Refrigerate at least 3 hours,

FOR PEARS: Bring wine and sugar to simmer in heavy medium saucepan,
stirring until sugar dissolves. Add pears and star anise. Cover;
simmer until pears are just tender, turning occasionally, about 10
minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to plate; chill until
cold. Boil poaching liquid in saucepan until reduced to 1/4 C, about
10 minutes, cool.

Remove tart pan sides. Slice pear halves lengthwise. Arrange pears
atop tart, fanning slightly. Brush poaching liquid all over pears.
(Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover, chill.) Garnish with white
chocolate shavings and candied violets.
