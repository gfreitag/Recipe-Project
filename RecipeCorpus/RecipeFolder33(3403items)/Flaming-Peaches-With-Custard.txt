4    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Sugar

Soak the sugar cubes in a bit of lemon extract or in rum while
preparing the sauce. Soak for 15-20 minutes. For sauce, beat egg
yolks (or use 2 whole eggs instead) in top of double boiler. Mix in
the 1/4 cup sugar, salt and scalded milk (milk is scalded when heated
until tiny bubbles form around edges, but do not allow to boil). Cook
over simmering water, stirring  constantly, until mixture coats
spoon. Cool quickly. Blend in vanilla. Chill. To prepare peaches,
place in baking dish cut side up and sprinkle brown sugar in hollows
of peach halves. Dot with margarine. Broil slowly until sugar forms a
crust. Place a soaked sugar cube in each peach half. Light cubes and
bring to table flaming. Serve with the custard sauce that has been
chilled.
