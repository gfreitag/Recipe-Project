Title: Flank Steak Sandwiches
Categories: Sandwich, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
4    Garlic cloves, sliced
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Rosemary
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Flank steak, trimmed (2 lb)
8    French rolls
Combine the olive oil, garlic, thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, salt
and pepper in a non-corrosive casserole. Add the flank steak and turn
it over once to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or
overnight, turning once.

Grill, broil or sear steak in a hot skillet for about 5 minutes per
side, or until desired doneness. Allow the steak to cool to room
temperature on a cutting board. Slice meat thinly on a diagonal
against the grain. Place slices on French rolls to make sandwiches
and top with horseradish slaw (recipe follows). If you make these
sandwiches in advance, it's a good idea to wrap them individually in
plastic wrap. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
