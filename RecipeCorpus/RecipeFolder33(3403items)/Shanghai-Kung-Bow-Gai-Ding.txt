Having recently visited Shanghai and enjoyed the true Chinese cuisine
(not the Americanized version), I decided to try and duplicate some
dishes. Here's one that was successful ;) This is very close to the
Shanghai style of kung bow chicken.  Each restaurant added it's own
touches, one even included cooked carrots. The dark soy sauce is
absolutely required.
