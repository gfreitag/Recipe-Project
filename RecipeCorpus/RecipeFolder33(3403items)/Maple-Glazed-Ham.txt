Use a fully cooked whole, shank or butt ham increasing cooking time
for larger whole ham.  If a country ham is used soak it in water or
apple cider (for a sweeter flavor) a few hours or overnight to remove
some of the salty taste.

Remove thick skin if a strong smoke flavor is desired.  Trim fat
leaving no more than 1/2 inch thick covering.  Score ham.  Combine
syrup, ginger, nutmeg and allspice.  Place ham in a large dish and
baste with syrup mixture.  Let the ham stand in syrup for 1 to 2
hours or until it reaches room temperature; baste frequently with
syrup. When ready to smoke, remove ham from dish, stud with cloves
and place on smoker grid.  Baste with syrup at least twice while
smoking. Before last hour of smoking decorate with canned pineapple
slices and cherries, baste again.  If using a meat thermometer, fully
cooked ham should reach an internal temperature of from 130 F to 140
F.  Make certain the thermometer is not touching the bone.

Charcoal - use 7 - 8 pounds charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 3-4wood
sticks and smoke 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 hours.

Electric - use 3 quarts hot water 3 - 4 wood sticks and smoke 2 to 3
hours.
