Title: Healthier Bagels
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 bagels
2    Envelopes dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water
4 c  Unbleached white flour
- may need 4 1/2 cups
1    Egg white
1 tb Water
Combine yeast and the 1 1/2 cups warm water in a large bowl. Stir to
dissolve yeast and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes.

Add flour 1 cup at a time. (The early part of this procedure may be
done with an electric mixer. When dough starts to become stiff, mix
remaining flour with wooden spoon.) Knead dough 8 to 10 minutes,
until it is smooth and elastic. Cover and let rise 30 minutes.

Divide dough into 12 portions. Roll each piece into a smooth ball.
Punch a hole in center of dough and shape like a bagel. Cover and let
rise 20 minutes.

In a large pot bring 1 gallon of water to a boil. Add 3 to 4 bagels
at a time and simmer for 5 minutes, turning once. Drain. Beat egg
white and 1 tablespoon water together lightly. Brush the bagels with
egg white mixture. Sprinkle on any desired seasonings. Bake in
preheated 375 degree oven 30 minutes, or until brown.
