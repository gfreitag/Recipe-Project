You can dress this bread up or down, and you'll love it either way.
Combine green and red maraschino cherries for a festive holiday
bread, or substitute your favorite dried fruits for a sweet morning
meal with a light crunch.  The pecans offer a perfect counterpart to
the fruit.

Success Hints
-------------

Drain cherries well on paper towel; add cherries whole for appearance.

Add the fruit & nuts at the beep, on the fruit & nut cycle or at the
end of the first knead.

You can replace half the cherries with chopped dried appricots, pears,
dates or apples.

Use regular, rapid or delayed time bake cycle.
