Title: Spicy Cheese Twists
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Pastry
Yield: 30 servings
2 pk Yeast -- not instant
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Curry powder
1/2 ts Paprika
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 c  Margarine
1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Milk -- scald
2 lg Eggs
4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Cornstarch
2 c  Cheddar cheese, shredded
1. Sprinkle yeast into 1/2 cup warm water. Let stand 5 minutes to
soften. 2. In a large mixing bowl combine curry powder, paprika,
cayenne, margarine, sugar, salt and milk. (Scald milk by allowing to
heat until bubbles appear around edges and top has a film on it. Do
not boil.) Cool mixture to lukewarm. 3. Add egg yolks and yeast
mixture. Gradually add flour to form a stiff dough, beating well
after each addition. You can use a mixer set on medium speed until
dough gets too stiff. Use a wooden spoon or a mixer that will handle
heavy doughs to combine completely. You may not need all the flour.
4. Cover and let rise in warm place until light and doubled; about 45
minutes. 5. Beat egg whites with corn starch until stiff; fold in 1
cup cheese. Set aside. 6. Stir one cup cheese into the dough. Divide
dough into 2 parts. Roll out on floured surface to about 1/8-inch
thick. Cut with 3-1/2 inch cutter dipped into flour. Pinch each
circle together across the middle. Gently twist the middle 2 times,
keeping the sides of the circles round and flat. Place each 1 inch
apart on greased cookie sheets. Top each side with 1 level teaspoon
of egg white mixture. 7. Let rise in warm place about 40 minutes or
until light. 8. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 10-12 minutes
until golden brown.

Yield: About 30 twists.
