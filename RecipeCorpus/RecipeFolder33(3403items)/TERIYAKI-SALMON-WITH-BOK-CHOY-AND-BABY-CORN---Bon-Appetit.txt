Meanwhile, heat 2 T vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over high
heat. Add minced ginger and stir-fry until aromatic, about 30
seconds. Add white part of bok choy and stir-fry until beginning to
soften, about 3 minutes. Add green part of bok choy and baby corn and

heated through, about 2 minutes. Add sliced fresh basil and reserved
3 T teriyaki glaze and stir to coat.

Place salmon on plates. Spoon vegetables alongside and serve.
