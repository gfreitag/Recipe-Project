JP>BTW - I am looking for
-some different ways to
-prepare ham, possibly
JP>smoked, candied,
-barbecued or some such.
-How do you folks do
JP>it in the South?
The absolute BEST way to
-cook a ham is in a good
-pit barbeque. One of
Those new electric smokers
-will do in a pinch.
-There's just something
About a ham slow-roasted
-over hickory or oak coals
-that makes my mouth
Water just thinking about
-it.  If you have a smoker
-(one of the large,
Barrel-shaped ones), you're
-in luck.  Just remove the
-skin from the ham,
And put it in the smoker.
-Place apple cider, with a
-little cinnamon and
Cloves, in the pan under
-the ham.  If you like, put
-1/4 to 1/3 cup good
Tennessee whiskey in the
-pan as well.  Let the ham
-smoke for several hours
(about 45 minutes per
-pound).  The aroma will
-drive you wild!
If you don't have a smoker
-or a good pit barbeque,
-you'll have to make do
With an oven.  I don't cook
-hams in the oven often,
-since we get tired of
Eating the leftovers.  But
-when I do, this is how I
-do it.  Skin the ham,
And place in a roasting pan
-fat side up. Score the fat
-in a diamond
Pattern. Stick a whole
-clove in the center of
-each diamond.  Mix a bit of
cinnamon in brown sugar (sorry, no exact measurements on this one),
and pat the sugar mixture on top of the ham.  Bake in 325 deg F oven
for about 25 minutes per pound of ham.  Baste the ham with apple
cider every 30 minutes. Sorry that the recipes aren't exact, but I
learned these from my father. After you do it a few times, you quit
measuring things. By the way, serve sweet potatoes and fresh
cornbread with the ham. Other vegetables are OK, but sweet potatoes
are essential!
