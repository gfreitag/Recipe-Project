flour. Use a 3-quart casserole for this dish. Place 1/4 cup melted
margarine in casserole and add cut-up chicken. Roll chicken to coat
with the margarine. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

2. Saute onion, celery and green peppers in 1/4 cup margarine until
tender and onion is translucent and limp. Blend in 1 tablespoon
flour, salt and pepper to taste. Place this mixture around chicken.
Spoon topping over chicken. Have chicken broth boiling and pour over
the topping slowly. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown.
Sprinkle shredded cheese over topping for last 5 minutes of cooking
time if desired.

TOPPING: Combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar, salt, sage,
thyme and pepper in a mixing bowl. Cut in 1 tablespoon shortening.
Add slightly beaten eggs and milk; blend well. Stir in sliced olives.
