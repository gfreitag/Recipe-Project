"Since I have the time and energy, I try to do things the
old-fashioned way," says Philip Maschka, who spends summers at an
Iowa lake not far from the Clay County Fair. "I don't use mixers or
microwaves or bread machines." But you can use your mixer for this
honey-sweetened loaf.

Ground cinnamon

1. In large mixing bowl, combine the 2 cups boiling water, oats,
honey, butter or margarine and salt. Set aside to cool.

2. In a small bowl, soften yeast in the 1/2 cup warm water, stirring
with a spoon to mix. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.

3. When oatmeal mixture has cooled to lukewarm, stir in the yeast
mixture.

4. Add the 2 cups whole-wheat flour and beat till smooth.

5. Add the bread flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly. When the
dough becomes too thick to mix with a spoon, knead by hand on a
lightly floured surface. Add enough flour to make a moderately stiff
dough that's smooth and elastic.

6. Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl sprayed with non-stick
coating. Spray top of dough with non-stick coating. Cover with some
waxed paper and let dough rise in a warm place till it's doubled in
size (for about 1 hour).

7. Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and
divide in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

8. Roll out each half of dough on a floured surface to about a
12x9-inch rectangle. Sprinkle generously with half of the 1 teaspoon
cinnamon and half of the raisins. Roll up dough from short side.
Pinch edges and ends closed.

9. Place in a greased 8x4x2-inch loaf pan. Repeat with remaining
dough, cinnamon and raisins, and another 8x4x2-inch loaf pan.

10. Cover dough with waxed paper and let rise in a warm place till
about 1/2 inch above the edge of the pan to form rounded loaves (25
to 30 minutes).

11. Spray the loaves with non-stick coating and sprinkle with
cinnamon.

12. Bake in a 350-F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or till done. Cover
loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes, if necessary. Remove from
pans; cool completely on wire racks. Makes 2 loaves.
