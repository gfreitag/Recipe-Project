1 qt Vanilla ice cream
1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Cornflakes crumbs
Oil for deep frying
1/4 c  Honey
Cream, Whipped
4    Cherries, Maraschino
1.  Let the ice cream stand at room temperature for about 5 minutes to
soften slightly.

2. Combine the cinnamon, sugar and cornflakes crumbs in a shallow pan.

3. Using an ice-cream scoop, make 4 large balls of ice cream. Roll
these balls in the crumb mixture to cover completely.  Wrap in pieces
of aluminum foil and freeze for 5 hours.

4.  Heat the oil to 450 degrees in a deep pan.  As soon as it comes to
heat, uncover the ice-cream balls and deep-fry very briefly - about 2
seconds.  Drain momentarily and place in dessert dishes.

5.  Top each ball with 1 tbs. honey, a little whipped cream, and a
maraschino cherry.  Serve immediately.
