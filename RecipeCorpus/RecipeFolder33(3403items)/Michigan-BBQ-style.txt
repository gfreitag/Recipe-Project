The day before serving, make sauce by combining all ingredients
except the beef and buns. Store in refrigerator, shake or stir from
time to time. Braise, stew or simmer meat until it begin to get
flaky. This takes several hours so you can be started in the morning
of the day you plan to serve it. Remove fat from the meat and break
apart with fork, brisket will be in long shreds, so these should be
cut short enough to be manageable on a bun. Add sauce to meat and let
simmer for at least 30 min. Serve on sesame seed buns. You can cook
the meat a day early and double or triple the BBQ sauce depending on
how much meat you have.
