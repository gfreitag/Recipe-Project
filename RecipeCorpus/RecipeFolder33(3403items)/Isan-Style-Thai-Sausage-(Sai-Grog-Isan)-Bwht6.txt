Title: Isan Style Thai Sausage (Sai Grog Isan) Bwht6
Categories: Thai, Pasta/rice
Yield: 5 servings
3 3/4 c  Ground pork (80-85% lean)
4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Ground white pepper
3/4 c  Cooked rice
4 1/2 tb Minced garlic
Sausage casing -- 75 mm
1/4 c  Salt
Lime juice to taste
Sliced chilies to taste
Raw vegetables
Turn the casing inside out and rub gently but very well with 1/4 cup
salt and a little water. Rinse again and again until it become
odorless. Turn it right side out and squeeze out the excess water.
Combine ground pork, 4 tsp salt, white pepper, rice and garlic and
mix well. Tie a knot at one end of the casing and stuff with the
sausage mixture. Poke a few holes with a clean needle where the air
bubbles are present inside. Tie another knot at the end to close.
Charbroil or fry over medium-low heat until golden brown and fully
cooked. Poke more holes if necessary to prevent the sausage from
rupturing. Slice the cooked sausage into 1/4" pieces and arrange
nicely in a plate or platter. Sprinkle lime juice. Serve with cooked
sticky rice, chili peppers and raw vegetables. Makes about 5
servings. NOTE: The chilies may be added to the pork mixture instead
of serving as vegetables. From Gail Shimizu.
