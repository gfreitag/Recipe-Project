Title: Chickpeas With Zucchini (Chana Aur Torre)
Categories: Indian, Low cal/fat, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Split chana dal
1 ts Ground turmeric
1 md Zucchini -- chopped
Salt
2 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Coriander leaves -- chopped
TEMPERING:
1 tb Olive oil
1 ts Cumin seed
1 md Onion -- thinly sliced
1/2 ts Red pepper powder
GARNISH:
1 tb Coriander leaves -- chopped
Soak and wash the chana dal.  Soak the dal in sufficient hot water to
cover by 2" for about 5 hours.  Drain.  In a saucepan, combine the
dal, turmeric and sufficient water to cover by 2".  Bring to the
boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour.  Add the zucchini, stir
and continue cooking for 30 minutes or until the dal is soft and
tender, adding more water if necessary to prevent burning and
sticking to the pan.  The finished dal should have the consistency of
a coarse puree.  Add the salt and lemon juice. Tempering: Heat the
oil in a small non-stick skillet over moderate heat. Add the cumin
seeds and stir until they crackle.  Add the onion and cook, stirring,
for about 2 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low. Add 2 tbsp water. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown, about 10 to
15 minutes.  Pour over the cooked dal and zucchini. Serve sprinkled
with chopped coriander leaves.  May be prepared 1 to 2 days ahead.
Prepare tempering and pour over the cooked dish just prior to
serving. 147 calories and 3 grams fat.
