Yield: 1 servings
57    JASON HAAS
2 pt Fish sauce -- I like golden
Boy
3 pt Sugar
4 pt Rice wine vinegar --
(seasoned or not it
Matter)
1/2 pt Chili garlic sauce -- (any
Kind will do)
Put  all four ingredients into a stainless steel pan and heat to
boiling. Cook untill the sugar is melted and cool.

We use this sauce for Pad Thai, in fact that is what it was created
for. But now we use it for all kinds of things. To make a quick
cucumber and red onion pickle, peel your cucumber, seed it and cut it
into half moons. Peel and cut your onion in half, and then in half
moons. Toss with some of the sauce and you've got a good cucumber and
red onion relish. To use it as nuoc cham, grate a carrot, chop a
clove or two of garlic, chop some dry roasted peanuts, and thin the
sauce down with water to taste. Add the carrots, garlic, and thined
sauce together, let it sit for a few minutes and garnish with peanuts
at service. With the nouc cham your looking for a light taste. The
basic sauce recipe can make alot, at work we use a cup as the
measure. You could use anthing you wanted, table spoons, quarter
cups, half cups, I think the recipe would even work if you measured
out in gallons. So good luck and let me know if you've tried this
sauce, later I'll post a Pad Thai recipe using this same sauce. Jason
