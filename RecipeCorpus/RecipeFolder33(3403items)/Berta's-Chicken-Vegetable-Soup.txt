Title: Berta's Chicken Vegetable Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Dried pearl barley
1    Chicken (2-2.5 lb), cut into
-quarters
4 c  Defatted chicken broth
2 c  Water
2 lg Onions, cut into 1/2" pieces
3 md Carrots, cut into 1/4"

3    Celery ribs, cut into 1/2"
-pieces
6 md Mushrooms, each cut into
-6 pieces
1/2 c  Dried green or yellow

2 ts Chopped fresh dill
Chicken broth is added along with water to give this soup a more
intense flavor. Don't cook the chicken for more than the one hour
called for, or it will dry out and become tough.

1. Rinse, then soak the barley in cold water for 1/2 hour. Drain and
set aside.

2. Clean the chicken well and place in a large, heavy soup pot. Add
the chicken broth and water to cover the bird, then bring to a boil
over high heat, uncovered. When the liquid starts to boil, add the
barley and all remaining ingredients except the dill; stir. When the
soup returns to a boil, reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook,
partially covered, for 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked through
and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.

3. Remove the chicken from the pot. When cool enough to handle,
discard the skin, shred the meat into large pieces and return about a
third of it to the pot. (Save the remaining meat for another use,
such as a salad.) Just before serving, stir in the dill.
