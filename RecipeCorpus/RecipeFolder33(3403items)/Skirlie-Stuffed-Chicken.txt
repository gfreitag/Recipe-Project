Title: Skirlie Stuffed Chicken
Categories: Scot/irish, Breads, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
3 1/2 lb Chicken w/ giblets
4 oz Oatmeal
1 md Onion; chopped
2 oz Suet; shredded  *or*
2 oz Bacon drippings
Salt & pepper to taste
Mixed herbs to taste
Set oven to 350Ã¸F or Mark 4.  Remove the giblets for the gravy. Rinse
and wipe the chicken well. Put the oatmeal, onion and the suet or
dripping into a bowl.  Add salt, pepper and herbs to taste. Mix well
with a fork. Stuff the chicken.  Take care not to overfill the cavity
as the oatmeal swells when cooked.  Place the chicken in a roasting
tin and roast for about 20 minutes to the pound and possibly 20
minutes over depending on the bird. Serve with roast potatoes and
fresh vegetables. Serves 4.

A versatile dish, Skirlie was often eaten instead of meat, especially
when times were hard.  Here it makes a delicious stuffing.
