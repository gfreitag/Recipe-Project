Sweet maple-apricot sauce glazes medallions of bacon-wrapped pork
tenderloin. Wendy Duch of East Lansing, Michigan, makes her own
apricot vinegar for the apricot-maple sauce. You can buy yours at a
specialty food shop or use a purchased fruit vinegar.

1. For meat: In a large skillet, partially cook bacon over medium
heat. Cut the pork tenderloin into 1 1/2-inch slices. Wrap a slice of
bacon around each piece of pork. Thread wrapped meat onto skewers.
Or, if you like, fasten bacon to meat with wooden toothpicks before
threading onto skewers.

2. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
Test for medium heat above pan. Place kabobs on a grill rack over
drip pan. Lower hood and grill for about 20 to 22 minutes, turning
once, or till a thermometer; inserted into meat registers 160-F.

3. Meanwhile, prepare Apricot-Maple Sauce: In a medium saucepan, cook
shallot in butter for 1 minute. Add apricots, vinegar, orange peel,
allspice and pepper. Carefully add the Grand Marnier or other liqueur
or juice. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 8 to 10
minutes or till thickened. Add maple syrup and heat through.

4. Remove meat from skewers. Serve immediately with warm Apricot-Maple
Sauce.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
