A sweet-tart lemon glaze tops this moist quick bread. It brought
Maxine Nelson of Elkhart, Indiana, a blue ribbon at the Elkhart
County Fair last year.

1. Grease and flour a 9x5x3-inch or an 8x4x2-inch loaf pan; set pan
aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oil, sugar, eggs and vanilla;
beat mixture well by hand.

3. Stir together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Add dry
ingredients to the egg mixture and stir till combined.

4. Stir in carrots and walnuts; mix till combined. Pour batter into
prepared pan.
