Title: Fancy Lazy Lasagna
Categories: Pasta/rice, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Ground beef
Tomato sauce (homemade or
Commercial)
Broad egg noodles
8 oz Mozzarella cheese, grated
1/3 c  Sour cream
1/2 c  Grated parmesan cheese
Onion, chopped
Celery, chopped
Green pepper, chopped
1    Clove garlic, crushed
In skillet, cook beef, onion, celery, peppers, and garlic until meat
is cooked through and vegetables are translucent.  Drain off fat.
Stir in tomato sauce, and simmer.  Meanwhile, cook broad noodles
until al dente. Drain and rinse well.  In greased 8 inch pan, layer
noodles, sauce and cheese alternately until used up.  Bake, covered
for about 25 minutes at 350F or until cheese is bubbly.  Remove
cover.  Turn oven to broil, and cook until cheese just starts to
brown.  Remove from oven.  Allow to rest for about 5 minutes for
mozzarella to 'set' up before serving. Serve with green salad and
garlic toast. (Garlic toast can be browned at the same time the
broiler is going to finish off the Lasagna)
