Perhaps the most famous fake is mock apple pie, popularized by the
makers of Ritz Crackers in the 1940's.  The pie uses absolutely no
apples. Instead of fruit, the filling is nothing more than candied
cracker crumbs with just enough lemon juice and cinnamon to hint of
Mom's real thing. Preheat oven to 425F.  Roll out half of the pastry
and fit it into a 9-inch pan. Break the crackers coarsely into the
pastry lined pan. Combine the water, sugars and cream of tartar in
saucepan; boil gently for 15 minutes. Add lemon juice and rind., and
let cool.  Pour the mixture over the crackers. Dot with butter and
sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll out the remaining pastry and cover the
cracker mixture. Trim and flute edges. Cut slits in top crust to let
steam escape. Place in oven and bake for 30 - 35 minutes or until
crisp and golden.  Serve warm or at room temperature. makes 6 - 8
servings. From: Earl Shelsby
