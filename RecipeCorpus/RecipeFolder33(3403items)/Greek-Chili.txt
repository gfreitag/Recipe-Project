Categories: Chili, Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
4 c  Water
4 lb Lean ground beef
2 md Onions, chopped
2 cn Tomato sauce (15-ounce
Cans)
4    Cloves garlic, finely
Chopped
3 tb Chili powder
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Ground allspice (up to 1 1/2
Tablespoons)
1 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground red pepper
2    Bay leaves
2 tb White vinegar
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
Bring the water to a boil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot.  Add the
ground beef and boil for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to crumble
the meat.  Remove and discard any fat from the top of the mixture, if
desired. Stir in all of the other ingredients.  Bring to a boil, then
reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours.  Remove and discard the bay
leaves before serving.

NOTE:  "You may read this recipe and question boiling the ground beef
in water instead of browning it.  But we followed Judy's directions
and came up with the same unusually smooth texture she does."

Makes 10 cups.
