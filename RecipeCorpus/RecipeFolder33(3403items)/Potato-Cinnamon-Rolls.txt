2 pk Yeast
1/2 c  Warm water
2 tb Sugar
8 1/2 c  Flour -- approximate

DOUGH:
Mix potatos and milk until smooth.  Add 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar,
cardamom and salt.  Heat to lukewarm (110 degrees).  In a large bowl,
combine yeast, water, and 2 Tbsp sugar.  Let stand until foaming,
about 10 minutes.  Add potato mix, 4 cups of flour, eggs and vanilla.
Beat until smooth.  Gradually sitr in enough additional flour to make
smooth dough. Turn out onto heavily floured board and knead until
elastic, about 15 minutes.  Add more flour if needed.  Let rise 1 1/2
hours.

Punch dough down, knead briefly to remove bubbles.  Divide in half.
Let rest.

FILLING:
Melt 1/2 cup butter.  Mix together brown sugar, sugar, and cinnamon.

Roll each portion of dough into a 5x18 rectangle.  Brush with butter
and sprinkle with half of cinnamon sugar mixture.  Roll up jelly-roll
style. Using a very sharp knife, cut into 12 pieces, 1 1/2" wide.
Place in a 9x13 pan, brush tops with butter, cover, and let rise
35-40 minutes.  Repeat with other half of dough.

Bake at 350 degrees 30 minutes.

TOPPING:
Mix together powdered sugar, nuts, cinnamon, butter, and enough water
to make a thick glaze consistency.  Spread gently over tops of warm
rolls.
