Title: Seared and Pickled Green Peppers(Ardei Copti)
Categories: Vegetables, Romanian
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Peppers
1 x  Salt
1 x  Vinegar
Pick large meaty peppers or pimientos. Wash well and allow to dry.
Place peppers over high flame on top of stove(or bbq)and sear untill
all skin has turned black and pepper is baked. Do not break or prick
skin while searing. As peppers are finished place in a container and
cover. When all peppers have been done, remove the skins. Place in a
clean container salt well and allow to stand a few hours or
overnight.  Wash jars in hot water, place peppers in jars and cover
with a liquid made of 1 part vinegar to 1 part of water. The juice
left from the peppers should be considered as

part of the water content. Seal; waterbath and remove, turn upside
down and cool before storing. Sorry 'bout the translating typo's just
multiply. Submitted By MARK MIKLAS   On   08-11-95
