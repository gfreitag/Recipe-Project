Title: Better Than Store Bought Bacon Horseradish Dip
Categories: Appetizers, Meats, Bbq/grill, Dips/spread
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
1 c  Sour cream
1 tb Plus 1 tsp. prepared
-horseradish
1 sl From a medium onion, about
-1/3 inch thick
Oil, preferably canola or
-corn
3    To 4 slices bacon, chopped
2 oz Fresh mild goat cheese, at
-room temperature
Potato chips and carrot
-sticks
Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 to
220 F.

Spoon the sour cream and 1 Tbsp. of the horseradish into a smokeproof
baking dish.  Rub the onion slice with the oil.  Place the sour cream
and onion in the smoker side by side and cook for 30 to 40 minutes.
The sour cream should be runny but not separated, and the onion well
softened but not cooked through.

While the sour cream and onion cook, fry the bacon in a small skillet.
Drain the bacon.

Stir the cheese into the sour cream until well combined.  Chop the
onion and crumble the bacon.  Mix into the sour cream. Add as much of
the remaining teaspoon of horseradish as desired.  The smoked
horseradish will mellow in flavor, and any added at the end create a
pleasantly pungent bite.
