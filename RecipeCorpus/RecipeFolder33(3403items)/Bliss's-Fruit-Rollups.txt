Hmmmm....let me see...brb... ok, here ya go...This is from the Ronco
Food Dehydrator recipe book:

"Puree various fruits available to you...such as peaches,
strawberries, bananas, apples, etc., this can be done in a kitchen
blender or food processor by adding a little fruit juice.  Sweeten it
to taste. Pour the prepared liquid onto "Saran Wrap" (that is layered
on your food dehydrator tray)  Place a large sections over an entire
food dehydrator tray and cut out that section directly over the
middle (round hole) which will allow the heated air to circulate.
Allow to stay ing the Food Dehydrator for a day and a half. To
release, pull off the dried "Roll-up" from wrap and serve.

Hope that this helps!!
