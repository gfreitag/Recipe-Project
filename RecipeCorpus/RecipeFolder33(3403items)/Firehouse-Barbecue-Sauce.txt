Every time Virginia M. Christie of Bloomington, Minnesota, simmers a
batch of this tangy-sweet sauce, she remembers her Uncle Mal. He
drove the hook-and-ladder truck for Firehouse No. 37 in Chicago and
was known for this sauce. Virginia slathers it on ribs and chicken,
and uses it in sloppy Joes and as a sauce for meatballs.

1. In a medium saucepan, stir together all ingredients. Heat to
boiling. Reduce heat and boil gently, uncovered, for about 20 minutes
or till slightly thickened and reduced to about 2 cups.

2. Brush over chicken or ribs during the last 10 to 15 minutes of
grilling. Or mix with cooked ground meat for sloppy Joes or serve
with meatballs.
