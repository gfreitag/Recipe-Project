16 oz Shrimp -- ground
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Sugar
4 ts Fish sauce -- (Nam Pla)
1 c  Water chestnuts -- ground
1    Loaf white bread
1/2 c  Sesame seeds
Vegetable oil -- for fruing
Heat iron skillet to near smoking stage. Remove from burner and add
sesame seeds to toast. They will immediately start "jumping about",
so have a dish to pour them into handy. Remove crusts from bread. In
a mixing bowl, mix first seven (7) ingredients. Spread paste over
bread slices and splinkle with sesame seeds. GENTLY press in the
seeds. Place slices on waxed paper or tray and freeze until it is
firm enough to cut into four pieces. Remove from freezer. Heat oil
for frying. Cut bread slices, drop into hot oil and fry til golden
brown. Arrange on serving trays as appetizers, or serve on garnished
plates. This recipe also (as is Gen Tso's Chicken) courtesy of The
