Title: Peppers And Green Chili Meatloaf
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1 lb Lean ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork
2    Italian sausage links
1 c  Cornbread stuffing -- * see
Note
1    Onion -- chopped
1    Garlic clove -- minced
1/4 ts Garlic powder
4 oz Green chiles -- minced
1    Egg
1 tb Chili powder
8 oz Tomato sauce
1 pn Ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1    Green pepper
* Use prepared stuffing mix in box.

Combine the ground meat, pork, and sausage in large bowl. Mix in the
stuffing mix (which has been crushed slightly), onions, chiles,
beaten egg, chili powder, garlic and garlic powder. Pour in half the
tomato sauce and mix very well with your hands. (Wear plastic baggies
on hands.)

Slice the green bell peppers into very thin slivers. Grease a cookie
sheet with at least 2-inch sides. Place the green peppers onto the
sheet.

Press the meat mixture into a loaf dish and then turn out on top of
the slivered green peppers, tucking under any peppers slices that are
not under the meat.

Bake in a preheated 375-degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Drain
off any fat from dish. An easy way is to absorb the fat with paper
towels. Pour the remaining tomato sauce, which has been blended with
the nutmeg and Worcestershire sauce, over the top of the meatloaf.

Continue baking for 5-10 minutes longer. Let stand 15 minutes before
slicing.
