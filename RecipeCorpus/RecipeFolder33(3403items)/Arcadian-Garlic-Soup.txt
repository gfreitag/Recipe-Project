Title: Arcadian Garlic Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
20    Cloves Garlic, unpeeled
5 tb Olive Oil
5 c  Chicken Stock
2 ts Fresh Thyme
1/2 ts Salt
White Pepper
3    Egg Yolks
Sliced French Bread or Toast
Grated Cheese
Blanch the garlic for 1 minute, drain and peel. Cook it, but do not
let it brown, in half the oil for 10 minutes. Add the stock, thyme,
salt and plenty of white pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes and check the
seasoning.

Sieve or blend the soup, keeping a few garlic cloves whole. Return
the soup to its saucepan and keep hot.

Beat the egg yolks and gradually add the remaining oil. Stir a couple
of spoonfuls of the soup into the egg mixture, remove the soup from
the heat and add the egg in a thin stream, stirring well.

Serve immediately with sliced French bread or toast, and a sprinkling
of grated cheese in each bowl.

Variation: Omit the oil and egg yolk mixture and poach six fresh eggs
in the simmering, un-pureed soup.
