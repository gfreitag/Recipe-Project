1 pk Instant lemon pudding mix
1 c  Apricot nectar
Lemon cake mix -- * see
Note
4    Eggs
3/4 c  Oil
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Lemon zest
* Use a standard size cake mix, but not a pudding cake mix. See
directions for glaze at end of recipe.

1. Place pudding into bowl with apricot nectar and let set while
mixing the rest of ingredients. 2. Combine the cake mix, eggs (one at
a time, beating well after each), oil, lemon juice and lemon zest;
add the pudding mixture. Beat well with mixer and pour batter into
oiled tube or bundt pan. 3. Cook at 350 degrees for 40-50 minutes.
Remove from oven; take out of pan immediately. 4. Punch holes in top
with a fork and spoon glaze over top of cake. One suggestion: mix
powdered sugar, lemon juice, sour cream and margarine to a thin
pourable consistency. May also substitute apricot nectar for the
lemon juice.

Apricot Lemon Glaze: Mix 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup apricot nectar,
and 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar until smooth.
