Title: Biscotti De Prato
Categories: Italian, Breads, Desserts
Yield: 54 biscotti
1 c  Whole, unblanched almonds
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
ds Salt
3    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 ts Lemon zest
1    Lightly beaten egg white
Place almonds on a baking sheet and toast in a 350'F. oven for 10
minutes, shaking pan once or twice. Place a third of almonds in food
processor and process until fine. Coarsely chop remaining almonds.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large
mixing bowl. Make a well in center and add eggs, vanilla and lemon
zest. Using a fork, draw flour, a little at a time, into center of
bowl. If necessary, use hands to combine mixture. Dough will be
stiff. Let dough rest 5 minutes. Knead dough for 3 minutes, mixing in
ground and chopped almonds.

Divide dough into 3 portions and roll each into a 10" cylinder.
Carefully transfer to a buttered and floured cookie sheet, leaving a
few inches between them. Flatten rolls slightly. Brush tops with egg
white and bake in a 350'F. oven for 20-25 minutes, or until lightly
browned. Cool slightly. Carefully remove rolls from pan and place on
a cutting surface. Using a serrated knife, cut each roll into 1 1/2"
slices on a 45-degree angle. Reassemble rolls on pan, leaving a small
space between slices. Bake 15-20 longer.
