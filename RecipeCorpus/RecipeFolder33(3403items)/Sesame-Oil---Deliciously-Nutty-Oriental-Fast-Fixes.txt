4 ea Ideas for Sesame Oil
If you've been saving this fragrant oil for Asian cuisine only,
you'll be glad to know it's a great flavor booster for other dishes
too -- just a few drops will do the trick.  To insure deep flavor,
add right before serving.

1) Make a quick dipping sauce for batter-fried vegetables: Combine
1/2 cup chicken broth, 2 tablespoons sherry*, a chopped clove of
garlic and a minced green onion; stir in a pinch of sugar and 4 drops
of sesame oil.

2) This is also nice brushed over kebabs of chicken fish, pineapple,
green or red peppers.

3) Enhance a simple soup of tortellini in chicken broth by sprinkling
a few drops in each bowl.

4) Zip up a hot fudge or butterschotch sundae by stirring a little
sesame oil in prepared sauce before pouring over ice cream - then top
with toasted sesame seeds for crunch.

* teri's note: use dry sherry or, better, sake (rice wine - available
at most stores that sell liquor)
