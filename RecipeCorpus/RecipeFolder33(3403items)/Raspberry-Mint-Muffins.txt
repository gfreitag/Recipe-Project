Preheat oven to 375F. and butter 12 muffin cups. Put the honey and
butter in a small saucepan and place over low heat to melt the
butter, but don't let it boil. In a medium mixing bowl, mix the
flours, baking soda, salt, and ginger or allspice. Set aside. In a
separate mixing bowl, beat the eggs and yogurt, then whisk in the
honey and butter, which should now be melted. Reserve. Chop the mint
leaves coarsely,then sprinkle the tablespoon of sugar over them and
mince the leaves until quite fine. In a small bowl, toss this mint
sugar with the raspberries. Make a well in the dry ingredients and
stir in the liquid ingredients just to blend. Fold in the raspberries
on the last few strokes. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin
cups and sprinkle each one with a pinch of sugar if you wish. Bake
for 20 minutes then cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then remove muffins
from the cups.
