Stir the Brine ingredients to dissolve. Rinse and wash the pork in
running water. Immerse the pork chunks in brine poured into heavy
plastic bags. Force the air from the bags and seal.

Marinate the pork for 12 to 18 hours in the refrigerator, turning
twice. The meat should "cure" to a light gray and become firm.

SMOKING:

Prepare electric smoke oven with at least a quart of water and a good
handful of wook chips or twigs.  Use hardwoods or fruitwoods in the
chip tray.  Soak them to prolong the smoke. Spray racks with
vegetable cooking spray. Place pork on racks without piercing with a
fork. Smoke the meat at a bare sizzling temperature (175 degrees F)
for 4 to 4 1/2 hours. Replenish the water pan or chip tray if
necessary.

Remove pork and disconnect smoker. Allow the meat to cool for half an
hour. Trim the meat of skin and fat, and remove the meat from bones.
Using a large knife or cleaver, slice, dice and mince the meat. The
meat should still be slightly pink, even when fully cooked. This is a
characteristic of smoke ovens.  (The cooking is not completed yet,
however.)

Simmer the sauce ingredients gently for 1 hour or until slightly
thickened. Allow it to cook, stirring occasionally. Blend the minced
pork with the sauce, reserving 1/2 cup of sauce for the table.  Pack
into casserole dishes, cover, and heat in a 200 F oven for 1 hour.
Uncover, stir, and serve.
