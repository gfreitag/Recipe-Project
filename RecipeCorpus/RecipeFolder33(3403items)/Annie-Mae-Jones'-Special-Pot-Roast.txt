1. Rinse salt pork to remove excess salt, blot dry, and cut into small
dice. Place in a heavy stew pot over low heat until all fat has been
rendered. Remove and discard pork dice (or save to add to green salad
~ it's great).

2. Heat the rendered fat to almost smoking, add the beef, and brown
it on all sides, turning it with a spatula and wooden spoon. (Do not
pierce with fork or juices will run out and meat will become dry and
stringy.)

3. When meat is well browned, remove it from the pot and set aside.
Pour off all cooking fat and discard. Return meat to pot, sprinkle
generously with salt and pepper, and add water. Cover tightly and let
cook over low heat for 2 hours. Add tomatoes, cover again, and
continue to cook until meat is almost tender, about 30 minutes.
Arrange potato cubes, onions, and carrots around meat. Cover and cook
a final half hour, or until vegetables and meat are tender.
