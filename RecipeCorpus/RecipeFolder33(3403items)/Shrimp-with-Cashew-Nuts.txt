Ken Hom calls this 'fast food of great quality' which exactly fits our
criteria.  It's a typical Hong Kong dish based on a classic Chinese
cooking technique called 'velveting.'  it is the perfect description
for the way the surface of an ingrdient looks and feels after it has
been oil blanched, a variation of the more familiar water blanching.
In Chinese cooking, oil blanching acts as a flavor sealer and keeps
various flavors separate. It also equalizes cooking times in a stir
fry of diverse ingredients. Serves 4-6.
