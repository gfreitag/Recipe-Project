Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare a 11 x 9 x 2 pan with cooking spray.
Wrap tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in oven for 7 to 10 minutes
or until softened.  Meanwhile, in a saucepan of boiling water, blanch
zucchini for 2 minutes or until just tender.  Drain, rinse under cold
water to stop the cooking, and pat dry with paper towel.  In a large
bowl, combine zucchini, rice, onions, sour cream, 1/2 cheese, salt,
and pepper.  Spoon 1/8 of the filling onto each tortilla and spread
it down the center.  Roll tortillas to enclose filling and arrange,
seam side down, in prepared pan.  Cover pan with aluminum foil and
bake the enchiladas for 10 minutes or until heated through.
Meanwhile, prepare sauce. In a medium saucepan, heat oil over
moderate heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5
minutes or until softened.  Add garlic and chili power and cook,
stirring for 1 minute.  Add tomatoes and broth, simmer and stirring
occasionally, for 10 minutes or until sauce has thickened slightly.
Stir in coriander. Spoon sauce over enchiladas, sprinkle with
remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and bake 8 to 10 minutes longer or until
cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling.
