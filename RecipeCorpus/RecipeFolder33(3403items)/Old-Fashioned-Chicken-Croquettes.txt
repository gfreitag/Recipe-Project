Categories: Breakfast, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Margarine
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Evaporated skim milk
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Chopped onions
2 c  Cooked chicken -- minced
3 tb Pimientos -- chopped
1 ds Ground nutmeg
1    Egg yolk -- beaten
1 c  Button mushrooms -- whole
1 c  Bread crumbs -- *see note
1    Egg
Canola oil
* Use cracker crumbs instead of the bread crumbs if preferred. Make
sure the bread or cracker crumbs are finely crushed.

1. Melt margarine in a skillet. Stir in flour and cook, stirring
constantly, until light brown. Gradually stir in the chicken broth and
milk. Stir constantly over low heat until mixture is thick. Blend in
all the remaining ingredients except crumbs, whole egg and the oil.
Allow the mixture to cool. 2. Place crumbs in a plate and the whole
beaten egg in a small bowl. Shape the mixture into croquettes. Dip
first in the crumbs, then into the beaten egg and again in the
crumbs. Have the oil about 3-4 inches deep and heat until very hot.
Fry the croquettes until browned. Drain well on paper towels. 3.
Serve the croquettes with a white sauce and if desired also cooked
vegetables such as green peas.
