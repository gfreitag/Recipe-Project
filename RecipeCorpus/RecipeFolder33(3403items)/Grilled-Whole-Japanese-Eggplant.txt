Title: Grilled Whole Japanese Eggplant
Categories: Bbq/grill, Japanese, Vegetables
Yield: 1 serving
Japanese eggplant
Description:

Small and slender, Japanese eggplants are perfect grilling material.

Instructions:

Leave the stem intact, simply cut the eggplants in half lengthwise
(the stem will help hold the eggplant together as it cooks).  Brush
the side of the eggplant with the teriyaki sauce left over from the
yakitori recipe. Grill over a hot fire, cut side down, until nicely
browned, Then turn the eggplant and cook fir 1 or 2 minutes on the
skin side. Brush with a little more teriyaki sauce before serving.

Notes:

If you cannot find the small Japanese eggplants, you can use the
larger common eggplant.  Trim and cut into 1 1/2-inch slices before
cooking. Submitted By BOB SHIELLS   On   08-08-95
