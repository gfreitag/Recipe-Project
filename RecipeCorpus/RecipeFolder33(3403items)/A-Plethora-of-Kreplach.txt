A PLETHORA OF KREPLACH

Kreplach are like Jewish ravioli. These delectable filled dumplings
are usually added to sopus (especially chicken soup). They can also
be eaten as a side dish, boiled, sauteed in margarine, or fried and
served with Onion Sauce. Fruit kreplach such as cherry varnikas, make
a good side dish. Meat kreplach are often served on Purim, Erev Yom
Kipper, or Hoshanah Rabbah, while the cheese variety is popular on
Shavuot or Chanukah.
