* For this recipe, you will need about 1-1/2 pounds of turkey breast
tenderloin steaks, cut into 8 slices.

1. Place each turkey steak between sheets of waxed paper and pound
with meat mallet until about 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper if desired. Use a heavy skillet large enough to hold all
turkey slices in one layer or use 2 skillets. 2. Heat the olive oil
and 1 tablespoon of the margarine. Add turkey, garlic, bay leaf and
thyme. (Use sprigs of thyme if using fresh.) Cook over medium-high
heat for about 5 minutes or until lightly browned on both sides. Do
not overcook. 3. Remove turkey to serving platter and keep warm.
Leave other ingredients in pan. Add the wine to pan and cook over
high heat until reduced to half. Stir often to mix in the brown
particles in skillet. Add the broth and boil until reduced by half.
4. Stir in remaining margarine, capers and chopped parsley if using.
Add the turkey back to the skillet and reheat briefly. Remove bay
leaf before serving.
