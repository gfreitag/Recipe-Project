Gradually add corn syrup; continue beating until stiff peaks form. DO

lightly touched. Invert pan immediately and cool completely before

walnut halves.

CREAM FROSTING: Beat 1 egg white until stiff. Beat 1 cup heavy cream
until thick. Add 3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon
cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the cream. Fold gently into the
egg white along with 3/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts. Frost cake as
is or cut into 3 layers (using string or dental floss) if preferred
and frost each layer as you stack.
