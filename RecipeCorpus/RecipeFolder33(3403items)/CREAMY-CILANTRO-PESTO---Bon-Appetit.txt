Title: CREAMY CILANTRO PESTO - Bon Appetit
Categories: Bon appetit, Herbs/spice, Condiments
Yield: 1 cup
1 1/2 c  Packed fresh cilantro
1/3 c  Pine nuts (about 1 3/4 oz)
1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
-cheese (about 1 oz)
1 tb Grated lemon peel
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/4 c  (or more) olive oil
3 tb Whipping cream
In processor, blend first 5 ingredients until almost smooth. With
machine running, gradually add 1/4 C oil; process until smooth. If
pesto is dry, mix in more oil by spoonfuls. Transfer to bowl. Add
cream. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made ahead. See note at
end of Sun-dried Tomato and Olive Pesto recipe.)

NOTE: For a change of pace, serve this-instead of butter-with fresh
corn on the cob or warm corn bread. It also makes a nice dressing for
black bean salad, chicken salad or an orange and avocado salad
