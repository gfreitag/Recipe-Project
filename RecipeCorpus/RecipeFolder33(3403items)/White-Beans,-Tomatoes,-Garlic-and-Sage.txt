The night before the picnic, place the beans in cold water to cover,
to soak overnight. The next day, drain the beans and put them in a
large pot with fresh water to cover. (Do not add salt.) Simmer the
beans for 1-2 hours, testing them to see if they're tender.

Add water as needed. Add salt to taste when the beans are just
tender, and continue cooking for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet and add garlic, sage and
pepper; saute until the garlic begins to change color. Drain the
beans and add them to the hot skillet. Stir in tomatoes, and simmer
for 20 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary. Serve at room
temperature. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-06-95
