Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Sweet Butter
1 lg Onion, Peeled, Sliced

Rings
4    Loin Pork Chops, Cut
1-1/2" Thick
3 lb Sauerkraut, Drained &

1 tb Caraway seeds
6 cl Garlic, smashed and

Cooking times are based on the use of a standard (575-700 watt)
microwave oven and quantities for 4 servings - adjust cooking times
as required. Heat the butter in a 14"x11"x2" dish, uncovered, at 100%
for 2 minutes. Stir in the onions. Cook, uncovered, for 2 more
minutes. Arrange the pork chops on top of the onions, placing one in
each corner of the dish, with the bone against the side of the dish.
Spread the sauerkraut over the chops. Stir in the caraway seeds.
Press the garlic into the sauerkraut. Cover tightly with microwave
safe plastic wrap. Cook at 100% for 16 minutes. Insert an instant
reading thermometer right through the plastic into the thickest part
of a chop, without letting it touch the bone. The chops are done if
it reads 145 degrees. If the thermometer reads less than 145 degrees,
remove the thermometer, patch t hole in the plastic and cook at 100%
for another 1 or 2 minutes. Stir in the sour cream and pepper sauce.
Cover tightly with microwave safe plastic wrap. Cook at 100% for 2
minutes. Uncover. Serve hot. From: Joel Ehrlich
