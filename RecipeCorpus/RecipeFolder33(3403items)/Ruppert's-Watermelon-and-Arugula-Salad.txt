Chef John cochran says people think this sounds weird, but then change
their minds when they taste the appealing combination.

Season olive oil-coated cloves of garlic with salt and pepper. Roast
the cloves in a preheated 400'F. oven until soft (test by inserting a
small knife in one clove; it will be easy to pierce). Remove from
oven, and when cloves are cool enough to touch, remove skins.

Clean arugula and pat dry. Briefly warm balsamic vinegar with dash of
olive oil and the roasted garlic cloves. Toss with watermelon and
arugula, and serve.
