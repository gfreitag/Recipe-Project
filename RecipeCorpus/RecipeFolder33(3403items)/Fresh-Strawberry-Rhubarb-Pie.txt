Title: Fresh Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Rhubarb -- diced
1 pt Strawberries
1 1/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Tapioca -- quick-cooking
1/4 ts Salt
3 tb Margarine
1    Batch pie dough, enough for
-9" double pie crust
Wash rhubarb, cut away any tough parts and chop into small pieces.
Slice the strawberries and add to rhubarb. Mix the remaining
ingredients and add to fruit. Blend well and allow to stand for up to
30 minutes to allow sugar to penetrate strawberries. Pour mixture
into 9-inch pie crust, dot with margarine and cover with second
crust. Cut slits in top crust. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for
50-55 minutes. Cover pie with aluminum foil tented over it during
first 30 minutes, removing to allow crust to brown during the last
part of baking. About 10 minutes before done, brush on warm milk and
sprinkle top crust lightly with sugar if desired.
