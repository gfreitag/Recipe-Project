fresh fruit.

In a wide shallow saucepand or Dutch oven, combine the cocoa, sugar,
butter, instant coffee granules, vanilla, cinnamon stick and salt.
Gradually whisk in the boiling water.  Bring to a boil over high heat
and then reduce the heat to medium.  Simmer, stirring often for about
5 minutes or until it thickens up and becomes glossy.  At this time
it should be reduced to about 1 cup. Discard cinnamon stick.  Let
cool. Store in tightly covered jar in fridge for up to two weeks.
