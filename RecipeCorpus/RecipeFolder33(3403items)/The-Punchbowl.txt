* All frozen concentrates are to be thawed partially. ** Use as much
7-UP or equal amounts of other soft drinks to make the punch to your
taste.

1. Using a blender, blend the juices a little at a time, pouring into
large punchbowl or other large container. Blend the banana and
strawberries only until coarse blended, not pureed. Mix the ice water
in the punch bowl with other ingredients and stir to blend. 2. Just
before serving, add the club soda, ginger ale and enough 7-Up to suit
your taste. Stir gently to mix all juices from the sediment on bottom
of bowl. Serve this as is or over ice.
