Here's a potato dish that's simple, quick and tastes great! That's
why it's a favorite of Rhonda McKee of Greensburg, Kansas (110 miles
west of Wichita).

Non-stick spray coating

1. Spray one side of an 18-inch piece of heavy foil with non-stick
spray coating. On sprayed surface, arrange half of the bacon to
within about 2 inches of edge. Top with half of the potatoes, half of
the green pepper, half of the onion and half of the cheese. Top with
remaining potatoes, green pepper and onion. Sprinkle with seasoned
salt and pepper. Top with remaining cheese and bacon: Dot with
butter, if you like.

2. Spray another 18-inch piece of foil on one side; place it, sprayed
side down, atop potato stack. Seal all edges with a double fold.
Place the packet on the grill rack directly over medium to medium-hot
coals. Grill for about 40 minutes or till potatoes are tender,
turning the packet once.
