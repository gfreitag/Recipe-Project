Title: Homemade Butter
Categories: Dips/spread, Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Heavy whipping cream
1/2 c  Water
2    Ice cubes
Fit the steel knife blade into the work bowl of your food processor.
Process cream until whipped, about 30 seconds. Add water and ice
cubes. Process 2-3 minutes until butter has formed and separated from
the liquid. No harm will be done if you overwhip this mixture. Pour
butter and liquid into a fine strainer. With a rubber spatula, gently
press butter against sieve to remove excess moisture. DO NOT press
too hard or butter will go through strainer. Refrigerate butter in a
covered container.

This makes 1/3 cup butter. If you prefer salted butter, add 1/8
teaspoon or less of salt to cream before processing.
