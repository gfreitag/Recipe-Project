You may love your peaches & cream chilled, but the way to serve this
lovely light bread is warm from the oven.  Like your favorite peach
cobbler, the subtle richness of the flavors lends itself perfectly to
a light topping of fresh butter.  Try it for bread & butter
sandwiches and you may decide to make afternoon tea a ritual!

Success Hints
-------------

For a creamy texture, use low fat yogurt; if you're calorie-counting,
nonfat will do.

For more of a cobbler effect, increase nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.

The crust tents to be dark; you might want to try the "light" crust
setting.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
