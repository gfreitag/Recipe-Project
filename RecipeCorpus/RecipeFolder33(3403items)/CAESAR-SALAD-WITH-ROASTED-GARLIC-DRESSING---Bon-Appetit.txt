Categories: Bon appetit, Salads, Dress/stuff
Yield: 4 servings
2 lg Heads garlic
1/4 c  Dry vermouth
3 1/2 tb Plus 1/3 C olive oil
2 1/4 ts Minced fresh rosemary
3 c  1-inch French bread cubes
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Dijon mustard
1 ts Anchovy paste
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
Dash of hot pepper sauce
-(such as Tabasco)
1    Head curly endive, trimmed
1 lg Head romaine lettuce, torn
-into pieces
1 1/4 c  Grated Asiago or Parmesan
-cheese (about 5 oz)
Preheat oven to 300'F. Peel off papery outer skin from whole garlic,
keeping heads intact. Place in small casserole dish. Pour vermouth
over. Drizzle 1 T oil over garlic. Season with pepper. Cover, bake
until garlic is very soft and pastelike, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool
garlic.

Increase oven temperature to 350'F. Mix 2 1/2 tablespoons oil and
rosemary on baking sheet. Season with pepper. Add bread cubes and
turn cubes in oil mixture to coat. Bake until lightly toasted, about
15 minutes. Cool.

Squeeze garlic to remove cloves from skins. Place in small bowl and
mash with fork to form paste. Transfer paste to blender. Add fresh
lemon juice, Dijon mustard, anchovy paste, Worcestershire sauce and
hot pepper sauce and puree. With machine running, gradually add 1/3 C
olive oil. (Croutons and dressing can be made 2 hours ahead. Let
stand at room temperature.)

Reserve outer endive leaves for another use. Tear enough inner yellow
leaves into bite-size pieces to measure 3 C. Place in large bowl. Add
romaine. Pour dressing over. Toss well. Sprinkle cheese and croutons
over salad. Toss gently. Season with pepper and serve.
