Katie Koziolek, who lives near Freeborn, Minnesota (80 miles south of
Minneapolis), raises hogs with her husband, on their family farm.
Katie took a Minnesota Iron Range specialty and mixed her own rub to
flavor this tender pork roast. The result is a backyard star.

1. In a small bowl, stir together parsley, fennel seed, dried onion,
rosemary, oregano, salt, cloves, pepper, garlic powder and coriander.
Rub onto all surfaces of roast.

2. To grill the meat: In a covered grill, arrange medium coals around
a drip pan. Test for medium-low heat above the drip pan. Lower grill
hood. Grill for 1 1/4 to 2 1/4 hours or till a meat thermometer
registers 160-F and juices run clear. Add more coals as necessary.

3. Transfer meat to a warm platter. Cover and let stand for 15 minutes
before carving.

Makes 9 to 12 servings.

Note: To roast in oven, place meat on a rack in a shallow roasting
pan. Insert meat thermometer. Roast, uncovered, in a 325-F oven for 1
3/4 to 2 1/2 hours or till the thermometer registers 160-F and juices
run clear.
