MMMMM-----------------------PHYLLO PARCELS----------------------------
2 sm Pears, peeled, cored, sliced
2 sm Bananas, peeled, sliced
1/2 ts Grated orange peel
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
6    Phyllo pastry sheets
3/4 c  (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted
-butter, melted
FOR SAUCE: Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over low heat
until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until
syrup turns deep-amber color, occasionally brushing sides of pan with
wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming, about 14
minutes. Gradually mix in 1/2 C cream, then cinnamon (mixture will
bubble vigorously). Stir until caramel melts. (Can be made 1 day
ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Before using, rewarm over low heat,
stirring constantly and thinning with more cream if too thick.)

FOR PHYLLO PARCELS: Combine pears, bananas, orange peel and cinnamon
in bowl. Set aside. Cut two 8-inch squares from each phyllo sheet.
Stack phyllo squares; cover with plastic and damp towel. Place 1
square on baking sheet. Brush with melted butter. Place another
square atop first square so that points face in different directions.
Brush with melted butter. Place another square atop second square so
that points face in different directions than points of first 2
squares. Place about 3/4 C fruit mixture in center of phyllo. Brush
edges of phyllo with melted butter. Gather corners of phyllo together
to form parcel. Gently twist phyllo to enclose filling. Brush outside
with butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo, butter and fruit, forming
total of 4 parcels. Chill until butter has set, about 15 minutes.
(Can be made 4 hours ahead. Keep chilled.)

Preheat oven to 375'F. Bake parcels until golden, about 20 minutes.
Serve warm or at room temperature, drizzling with warm sauce.
