Categories: Breads, Fruit
Yield: 24 servings
1 c  Skim milk
4 tb Oil
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Yeast
1/4 c  Water -- warmed
2    Egg whites -- whipped
1/2 ts Ginger
1 ts Cinnamon
5 c  Unbleached flour
1/2 c  Cranberries -- chopped
Preheat oven at 350 after first and second rise.  Prepare a baking
sheet with cooking spray.  In a small bowl, proof yeast with 1/2
teaspoon honey in 1/4 cup water; stir and set aside until foamy, 5 to
10 minutes.  Heat milk to th boiling point and dissolve the oil,
sugar, and salt in it.  Let cool to lukewarm.  In a mixing bowl,
combine milk mixture, egg whites, ginger, cinnamon, and proofed
yeast.  Stir in almost all the flour until the dough starts to come
away from the sides of the bowl.  Turn out and knead about 3 to 4
minutes, adding more flour as necessary.  Sprinkle some flour over
the cranberries, then knead them into the dough.  Clean your bowl and
spray with cooking spray.  Return the dough to it; let rise, covered
with plastic wrap, until doubled in size. Turn out and roll the dough
to a thickness of 1/2".  Cut into 2 1/2" circles, plump the dough up
by pulling the sides under and pinching together on the bottom, and
place on prepared baking sheet an inch apart, seam side down.  Cover
with a kitchen towel and let rise about 30 minutes.  Bake for 25
minutes.
