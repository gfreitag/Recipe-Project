Title: Garnishing Carrot Wheels
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
Carrot garnishes also offer an appealing color contrast to foods
because the carrot is one of the few vegetables availabe throughout
the year that gives us the orange color needed to contrast the green
leafy salads and main dishes.  People who would not normally eat raw
carrots will not hesitate to munch on a carrot garnish if it is
presented in the right way.


1.  The carrot cartwheels, when used in a salad or soup, add that
little 'something' extra.  To make cartwheels, wash and cut off about
1/2 inch of the carrot tip.

2. Use the decorator tool and scrape the outside length of the carrot
using a downward stroke only. This is known as scoring the vegetable.
The downward scrape will creat small ridges all around the outside of
the carrot. After scoring the vegetable, slice the carrot crosswise
and you will get small carrot slices with a geared or cartwheel edge.
Mix these slices into a tossed salad or use them in your favorite
soup.
