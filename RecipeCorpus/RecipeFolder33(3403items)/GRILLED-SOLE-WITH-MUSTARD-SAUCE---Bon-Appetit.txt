Combine egg yolks and water in small metal bowl. Set over saucepan of

mixture constantly until very thick and thermometer registers 160'F,
about 3 minutes. Remove from over water; whisk 30 seconds. Gradually
add melted butter to egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to
incorporate completely. Whisk in Dijon mustard, dry mustard and 3
drops hot pepper sauce. Season to taste with more hot pepper sauce,
salt and pepper. Place metal bowl over saucepan of hot (not
simmering) water to keep sauce warm, and whisk occasionally.

Preheat broiler. Lightly butter large baking sheet. Brush both sides
of fish with oil; season with paprika, salt and pepper. Place fish on
prepared sheet and broil until cooked through, about 2 minutes per
side. Transfer fish to plates. Spoon sauce alongside and serve.
