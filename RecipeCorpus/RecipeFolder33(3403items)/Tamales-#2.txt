Title: Tamales #2
Categories: Tex/mexican, Meats
Yield: 24 tamales
10    Ears Fresh Corn
2 c  Masa Harina
1 1/2 c  Poultry Stock
2 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Salt
1/3 c  Lard
1 1/2 c  Sloppy Joe Filling
Remove the outer husks from the corn. Set the corn aside for other
use. Soak the husks in hot water for 5 minutes. Drain. Combine the
Masa Harina, baking powder and salt. Cream the lard (use an electric
mixer). Very gradually (1 or 2 tablespoons at a time) beat in the
corn mixture once the lard is fluffy. Continue to beat constantly
while slowly adding the stock until the dough is light enough to
float in a glass of water. Lay out enough of the corn husk leaves
(about 4" x 9" each) to make 24 tamales (overlap the leaves if they
are too small). Use a spatula to spread 1 tablespoon of dough in a 3"
x 4" rectangle on each leaf. Drop 1 tablespoon of sloppy joe filling
into the center of each dough lined leaf. Wrap by overlapping the
edges of the leaves lengthwise and folding up the ends. Layer the
folded husks, seam sides down, in a flat bottomed steamer colander or
on the tray of a tamale pot. Fill the steamer with water to about 1"
below the tray or colander base. Bring the water to a rolling boil.
Cover the pot tightly. Reduce heat and steam until the dough is firm
enough to pull away easily from the leaves (60 to 90 minutes). Serve
the tamales in the leaves on a well heated platter (the leaves will be
discarded). Plan on 3 tamales per person.
