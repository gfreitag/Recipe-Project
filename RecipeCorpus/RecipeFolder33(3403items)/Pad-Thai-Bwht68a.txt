Brown garlic in oil in large wok over medium heat. Add noodles and
water, decrease temperature to low. Saute until noodles become soft.
Add a little more water to prevent drying if necessary. Add tofu,
salted radish, peanuts, dried shrimps, fish sauce, sugar and vinegar.
Increase temperature to medium and mix quickly. Make an empty circle
in the middle and add eggs plus 1 tbsp of oil. Scramble and let sit
for 1 minute to cook. Turn the eggs over and let sit for another
minute then break into little pieces with spatula. Now combine
noodles and eggs together well. Increase heat to high and add bean
sprouts. Saute 2-3 minutes longer. Remove from heat and sprinkle
ground chilies, sugar, green onions and lime juice. Serve hot. Makes
10 servings. NOTE: When making 1 or 2 servings at a time, oil may
need to be increased to prevent the noodles from sticking together.
Use 1 egg for each serving (10 eggs for 10 individual servings
instead of 6 eggs for 10 whole servings) Adjust seasonings to taste.
