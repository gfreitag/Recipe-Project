The day before, either prepare the chicken broth using a standard
recipe or use canned chicken broth for convenience. Slowly simmer the
chicken broth until the meat is cooked through. Place the chicken out
overnight to dry. The next day, deep fry it in peanut oil and then
separate the meat from the bones. With your hands, tear the meat into
long narrow strips. Cut the green onions, carrots, ginger, and
pickles into long strips. Combine the green onions, lettuce, carrots,
scallions, red ginger, pickles, peanuts, coconut, and sesame seed.
Mix well.  Add the chicken. Starting with the sugar, mix the rest of
the ingredients with the exception of the parsley and won ton until
thoroughly combined.  Just before serving, add the parsley and won
ton pastry and toss lightly.
