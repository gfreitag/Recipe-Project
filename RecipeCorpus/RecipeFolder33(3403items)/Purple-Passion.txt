Bubba talks about purple passion on you Had To Be There when he is
talking about his old high school days. (Just before GrapeFruit Juicy
Fruit, I think. ) His Girl friend says, "you can't even taste the
alcohol." and he replies  "That's the idea.  What you don't drink
I'll pour all over you." Well here is one recipe for Purple Passion.
================================================ Pour in the Kool Aid
and sugar.  Add the alcohol and fill the bottle half way up with
water. Shake it up until everything is dissolved and then fill it up
to between 3/4/ to all the way up. and chill if not already cold. It
would be difficult for me to say enjoy but hey if it gets you laid
then congratulations.
