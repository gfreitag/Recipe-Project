Title: Like Magic Meringue Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 8 servings
8    Egg whites
1 ts Fresh lemon juice
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Almond extract
1. Grease a bundt pan heavily with vegetable oil. Preheat oven to 350
degrees. 2. In a large mixing bowl beat the egg whites with an
electric mixer. As the whites begin to feel and look firm begin
adding the sugar by teaspoons. Don't rush the mixing. Mix well after
each addition before adding more sugar. 3. Add the almond extract and
continue beating until whites hold their shape. 4. Carefully spoon
the whites into the bundt pan. Make sure there are no air pockets.
Push a knife blade down into meringue slowly to get rid of the air
pockets. Cover the top of the meringue with waxed paper and put the
pan into a larger round pan. 5. Add water to the larger pan to come
halfway up the sides of the bundt pan. Bake until the meringue is
firm and dry, about 30-35 minutes. 6. Remove the pans from oven and
place the bundt pan on a cooling rack. Cool the meringue cake
completely before removing from the bundt pan onto a serving plate.
Top with your choice of topping and slice carefully with a serrated
knife or slice first, then top each individual serving.

* This does not keep well so plan to serve the same day you prepare
it.
