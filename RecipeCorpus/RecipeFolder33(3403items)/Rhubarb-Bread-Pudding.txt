Categories: Desserts, Puddings
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Rhubarb -- cut in 1" pieces
2/3 c  Sugar
1    1/2 pound italian bread loaf
- cut into 1" chunks
2 c  Half and half
1 c  Milk
3    Egg
Nutmeg
1 tb Dark brown sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
3 tb Unsalted butter
In glass bowl, combine the rhubarb with sugar and let it sit for 1
hour. Preheat the oven to 300.  Butter a shallow 1 1/2 qt baking
dish.  In the prepared baking dish combine the rhubarb mixture and
the bread.  In a saucepan bring the half and half and the milk just
to the boiling point. In a bowl beat the eggs, add the half and half
mixture in a stream, beating, and stir in the nutmeg.  Pour the
custard over the rhubarb mixture, sprinkle the brown sugar and
cinnamon over the top, and dot the bread pudding with the butter.
Put the dish in a baking pan and add enough hot water to the pan to
reach halfway up the sides of the dish. Bake the bread pudding,
covered with foil, in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes and bake
it, uncovered for 30 minutes and bake it, uncovered, for 30 minutes
or more.
