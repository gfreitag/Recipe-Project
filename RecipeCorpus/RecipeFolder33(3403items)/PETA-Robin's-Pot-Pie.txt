Flour
For pie--set pie shell aside.  Combine flour, yeast, salt, garlic
powder and tofu in a paper bag and shake.  Saute the tofu mixture in
the oil until lightly browned.  Add the onion, celery, and carrots
and continue to saute until the onions are soft, about 5 mins.  Add
the other veggies and cook until the veggies are tender but crisp,
about 5 mins.

Preheat the oven 375.  Pour the gravy over the mixture in the skillet
and stir.  Then pour into the pie shell.  Roll out top dough and
place on the pie.  Bake 30 mins or until crust is lightly browned.

Variation--for a different take on this dish, pour the veg mixture
into an uncovered casserole dish and top with crushed cornflakes.
Bake 30 mins. For gravy--In large saucepan, simmer all but flour for
approx 5 mins. Slowly add the flour, tablespoon by tablespoon
whisking after each addition, until desired thickenss is reached.
