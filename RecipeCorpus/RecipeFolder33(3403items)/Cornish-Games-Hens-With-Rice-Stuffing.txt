lemon juice, and salt, if used, and bring the mixture boiling,
stirring to dissolve the bouillon cube.  Reduce the heat; cover, and
cook, slowly, about 20 to 25 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed
and the rice is fluffy. Stir in the drained mushrooms.  Lightly stuff
the birds with the rice mixture. Place, breast up, on a rack in a
shallow baking pan. Brush with melted butter or margarine.  Roast,
covered, in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 30 minutes.  Uncover
and roast 1 hour longer, or until the drumstick can be twisted easily
in the socket. Brush the birds with melted butter during the last 15
minutes of roasting time. Submitted By RICH HARPER   On   08-06-95
