1 c  Mashed potatoes -- ** see
Note
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt -- *** see note

* Do not use instant yeast. ** Use mashed potatoes made from fresh,

decrease the amount of salt called for in this recipe.

1. Sprinkle yeast over 1/2 cup warm (not hot) water. Let stand 5-10
minutes to soften yeast. 2. Combine scalded milk, shortening,
potatoes, sugar and salt in large bowl. Cool to lukewarm. Add yeast
and eggs; blend. Add 1-1/2 cups flour and mix well. Cover and let
rise in warm place for about 1 hour or until mixture is bubbly. 3.
Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out
onto lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic. Put
into lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover and
refrigerator overnight. 4. Shape into small balls. Place 3 or 4 into
greased and lightly floured muffin tins; brush with melted margarine.
Let rise in warm place for about 1-1/4 hours, or until doubled in
bulk. Bake in preheated 425-degree oven for 20-22 minutes.

Yield: 38-40 medium rolls.
