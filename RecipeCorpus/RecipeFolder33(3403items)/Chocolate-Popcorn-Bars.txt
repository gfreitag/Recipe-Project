Recipe by: I Love Popcorn Preparation Time: 0:15

Combine water, sugar, corn syrup, and chocolate in a saucepan, and
cook, stirring, until chocolate melts.  Bring to a boil gently until
candy reaches 254 on a candy thermometer.  Pour candy over candy over
warm popped corn in a big bowl. Stir with a spoon to coat all the
corn. Butter your hands and working fast, shape the popcorn into
candy-bar shapes (long, round or flat, as you wish). Wrap your candy
bars in foil or plastic wrap.
