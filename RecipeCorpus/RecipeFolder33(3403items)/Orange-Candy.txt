Title: Orange Candy
Categories: Candies
Yield: 32 servings
3 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Evaporated skim milk --
Undiluted
1 ds Salt
2 ts Orange peel -- grated
1 c  Black walnuts -- chopped
Put 1 cup sugar into a heavy skillet and stir slowly with a wooden
spoon over medium heat until the sugar is melted and caramelized to a
golden brown color.  Add the water and stir until the sugar is
completely dissolved.  Add the remaining 2 cups sugar, evaporated
milk and salt. Place over low heat and stir constantly until the
mixture boils.  Cook, stirring frequently, until it reaches the soft
ball stage (236 degrees). Remove from heat; cool to lukewarm.  Do not
stir.  Add the orange peel and nuts. Beat vigorously until the candy
loses its gloss and will hold its shape when dropped from a spoon.
Pour into lightly greased (margarine) 8 x 8 inch baking dish.  Cool
until set.  Cut into squares before the candy becomes too firm.
