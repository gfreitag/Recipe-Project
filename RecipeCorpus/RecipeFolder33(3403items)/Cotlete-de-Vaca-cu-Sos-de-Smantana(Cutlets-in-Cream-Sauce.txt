Title: Cotlete de Vaca cu Sos de Smantana(Cutlets in Cream Sauce
Categories: Meats, Romanian
Yield: 1 servings
6 x  Steaks or cutlets
1 x  Salt, to taste
1/2 pt Sour cream
3 x  Egg yolks
1 x  Juice of a lemon
1 tb Parsley, fresh, minced
Tenderize steaks with a mallet, salt to taste and fry quickly in
hot fat. Cover with water and cook until tender. When steaks are
tender the sour cream is mixed with egg yolks, lemon juice and
parsley and poured over steak. Mixture should heat thoroughly but not
be boiled. Remove meat and arrange on a hot serving platter, pour
heated sauce over meat and garnish with fresh carrots, new potatoes,
asparagus, cabbage, any available garden veggie, steamed. I've also
seen it done up with cooked elbow macaroni, to stretch it out.
