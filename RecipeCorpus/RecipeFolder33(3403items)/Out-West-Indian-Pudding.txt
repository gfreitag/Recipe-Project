Title: Out West Indian Pudding
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Milk -- * nonfat
1/2 c  Cornmeal -- ** see note
1/4 c  Molasses
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Margarine -- solid
1 ts Ground cinnamon
3/4 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1 ds Salt
1/8 ts Baking soda
1    Egg
* Use non-fat milk for best results and for lower fat content. ** Use
stone-ground yellow cornmeal if possible. Do not use cornmeal from a
packaged mix that has flour and sugar added.

Scald 2-1/2 cups milk. (Heat in heavy pan until tiny bubbles form
around edges.) In small bowl, put the remaining 1/2 cup milk and stir
in the cornmeal. Stir this mixture into hot milk. Bring to a boil and
simmer, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes. Mixture should be
thickened. Remove from heat. Add molasses, sugar, margarine, spices,
salt and baking soda. Blend. Beat egg, stir in a small amount of the
hot mixture and add the egg to the hot mixture. Using a wire whisk
for best results, whisk the mixture a few times. Lightly oil 6
individual custard cups or ramekins. Divide the mixture between the 6
cups. Place on a cookie sheet or oven-proof dish with at least a 1
inch rim; pour hot water in pan. (Do this while pan is in oven for
safety.) Bake in 275-degree oven for 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 and 1/2
hours. Serve puddings warm, not hot. Pudding may separate; this is
normal.
