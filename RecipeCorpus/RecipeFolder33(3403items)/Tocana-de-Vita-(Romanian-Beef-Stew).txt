Categories: Meats, Romanian, Soup/stew
Yield: 5 servings
1 lb Stew beef,veal or venison
1 tb Fat
1 c  Onion, minced
1 x  Garlic bud
1/2 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Salt
2 tb Green pepper, minced
2 c  Diced potatoes
1 tb Flour
1/2 c  Cold water
Wash the meat in cold water, then let stand in the same. Brown
onions in fat, add paprika and mix well. Add the meat, pepper, salt
and garlic. Mix well, cover and let simmer for about 40 min. Add
boiling water, green pepper and again let simmer for about 20 min.
Mix the flour with cold water, add slowly to the meat and mix well.
Simmer for about two minutes then set the stew aside.
Place potatoes in salted water, bring to a boil and let boil for 5
min. Remove potatoes from hot water and place in stew. Bring stew to
a boil and simmer gently for about 5 min. Serve hot.
Sorry about the translation, it was literal, from grama.
In the old country they always washed the meat first before
cooking, I always thought it was just because it was freshly
butchered, but soaking the meat tenderizes it greatly, and adds
liquid to the stew for gravy. Beef or Veal neck or shank works great,
though venison neck works- add peeled chopped apple in last 5 min.
Tocana(stew_) de vita is the food of life. ENJOY! mmm
