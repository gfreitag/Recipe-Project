Categories: Candies, Chocolate
Yield: 1 batch
9 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate;
-Chopped
1 c  Heavy Cream
20 oz Dark Sweet Chocolate;
-Chopped, Divided
1 tb Cocoa
2 ts Chocolate Liqueur
1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
Note:  This is a very messy two day project, but the result won third
prize in a local Death By Chocolate contest for Chuck Raby.

Combine the semi-sweet chocolate and cream in a small bowl and
microwave on HIGH, checking after 45 to 60 seconds, until melted and
smooth. DO NOT overcook.  Cool to room temperature, then stir in 4
ounces of the dark sweet chocolate, cocoa, and chocolate liqueur.
Cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  On
the following day, line a cookie sheet with waxed paper.  Working
quickly, with your fingertips, form the mixture into 1 to 1 1/2-inch
balls and arrange on the baking sheet. Refrigerate overnight again.
Microwave the remaining 16 ounces of dark sweet chocolate and the oil
as detailed above and line another cookie sheet with waxed paper.
Removing only 6 chocolate balls from the refrigerator at a time, dip
them, one at a time on a fork, into the melted chocolate, placing
each on the cookie sheet. Continue until all the balls are dipped.
Refrigerate until time to serve.  Trim off any excess chocolate just
before serving.
