Cut the lamb into 1-inch cubes. Chop the onions and the garlic cloves

they are large, cut into pieces.

Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the onions and the garlic
and fry, stirring, until the onions are soft, but not brown. Add the
lamb pieces and brown them all over. If fresh okra is being used, add
them to the pan and fry, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes,
tomato puree and salt and pepper to taste. Add enough water to cover
the meat and vegetables and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover
the pan and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender and
the sauce is rich. If canned or frozen okra is used, add it at the
end of the cooking time.
