Title: Honey Nut Buns
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 24 servings
6 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Lemon rind -- grated
2 pk Yeast -- not instant
1 c  Margarine
2 lg Eggs
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/3 c  Honey
1 c  English walnuts -- chopped
1/4 ts Salt
2    Egg yolks
1 ts Lemon peel -- grated
1. Do not sift flour. Place 1-1/2 cups flour in a large bowl. Add
sugar, salt, lemon peel and yeast. Soften margarine and add to flour
mixture. 2. Add 1-1/3 cups very warm (120-130 degree) water to the
flour mixture and beat 2 minutes at medium speed; scrape bowl
occasionally. 3. Add eggs and 1/2 cup flour; beat at high speed for 2
minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in more flour to make a
soft dough. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes. 4. Turn dough out onto
well-floured surface; divide into 3 parts. 5. Roll each piece to an
8-inch square. Cut each square into eight 1-inch strips. Twist each
strip and coil in a circle, sealing ends underneath. Place on greased
cookie sheet. 6. Make a wide indentation in center of each roll,
pressing to the bottom. Spoon filling into indentations, using 1
teaspoon for each roll. 7. Cover loosely and let rise in warm,
draft-free place until doubled in bulk. Bake in preheated 375-degree
oven for 15-20 minutes or until done. Repeat with each piece of dough.

TO FREEZE: After filling with nut-honey filling, place on greased
cookie sheets, cover with plastic wrap and freeze. When frozen,
remove from cookie sheets and place in plastic freezer bags. To bake,
remove from freezer, let stand at room temperature until completely
thawed. This will take about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Let rise in warm place
until doubled in size, about 45 minutes after thawing.

FILLING: Combine 1/3 cup honey, 1 cup finely chopped nuts, and salt in
saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for 3 minutes.
Gradually stir in beaten egg yolks and cook, stirring, until slightly
thickened. Stir in lemon peel then cool.
