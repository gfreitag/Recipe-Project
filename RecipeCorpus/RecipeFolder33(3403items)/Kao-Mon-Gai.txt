(Thai Garlic Rice and Chicken) To make chicken: Fill a large pot with
enough water to boil a whole chicken. Bring the water to a rapid boil
and slowly lower the chicken into the water. Let sit for 5 minutes
then take it out. Dip the chicken in another pot of cold water and
let sit 5 minutes.

Repeat this procedure 3 to 4 times or until the chicken is cooked
through but not overcooked. This keeps the chicken very moist inside.
Place the cooked chicken in a container and cover tightly until ready
to serve. Reserve the broth to cook the rice with. Wash and drain the
rice, set aside. Saute garlic in oil over low heat only until
fragrant but not brown. Add rice and saute 5 minutes longer. Transfer
to the rice cooker and add ginger, salt and chicken broth and let it
cook. Serve with sliced chicken, sliced fresh cucumber and sauce.

To make sauce: Combine all the ingredients in a blender and blend for
5 to 10 seconds. Add a little water if the mixture is too thick. The
sauce should be on the watery side. NOTE: Chicken broth may be made
ahead of time by boiling the wing tips, neck, ect. and then freezing.
Remove the solid fat on top once cold but before frozen. Thaw and use
in this recipe. The broth must be cooled before adding to the rice.
