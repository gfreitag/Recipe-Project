Title: Chicken, Rice And Vegetables In Foil
Categories: Poultry, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Rice
1    Onion -- minced
1/2 c  Green peppers -- chopped
1/2 c  Celery -- chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Water
2    Chicken breasts
10 oz Cream of mushroom soup
1/2 c  Milk
10 oz Mixed vegetables, frozen --
1    Bag
1. Mix the rice, onion, green pepper, celery and salt in a small
bowl. Add the water; stir to blend. 2. Divide the whole chicken
breasts; you will need 4 pieces. Tear 4 pieces of foil about 15
inches long. Divide the rice mixture into four portions, one portion
to each foil piece. Place the foil onto a cookie sheet with edges of
foil turned up so liquid does not run out. Place one piece of chicken
on top of each portion of rice mixture. 3. Blend the soup and milk;
spoon equally over the chicken. 4. Thaw the mixed vegetables just
enough to separate. Arrange the vegetables around the chicken. Bring
long ends of foil up and fold carefully. Fold the two sides up and
seal so juice will not run out. Place packs on a cookie sheet in a
preheated 375-degree oven. Bake for 1 hour. Fold back foil and serve
in the foil if desired.
