Determining how brown her baked goods get in the oven is one of the
toughest baking tasks, explains Vera Brandt of Holstein, Iowa. The
Clay County Fair winner is blind. Get out the butter and jam to
slather on generous slices of this home-style white bread.

1. In a small mixing bowl, combine potato flakes and boiling water;
mix well. Set aside for about 15 to 20 minutes or till lukewarm
(120-F to 130 F).

2. Lightly grease two 8x4x2-inch loaf pans or 9x5x3-inch loaf pans;
set the pans aside.

3. In a large bowl, soften yeast in the 1 cup warm water, stirring
with a spoon to mix. Add honey and salt.

4. Add the lukewarm potatoes to the yeast mixture. Add the beaten egg
and stir the mixture well.

5. Add as much flour as you can, about a cup at a time, mixing well
by hand after each addition.

6. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the
remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that's smooth and
elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape into a ball.

7. Place dough in a lightly greased bowl; turn once to grease surface.
Cover and let rise in a warm place till doubled (about 45 to 60
minutes).

8. Punch the dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
surface. Divide the dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

9. Shape each half of the dough into a loaf. Place in prepared pans.
Cover and let rise in a warm place till nearly doubled (30 to 40
minutes).

10. Bake in a 375-F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or till bread sounds
hollow when tapped. Cover loosely with foil for last 10 minutes to
prevent overbrowning, if necessary. Remove from pans and cool on wire
racks.
