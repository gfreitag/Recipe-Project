1 1/2 c  Water
2    Dried ancho chilies*
2    Garlic cloves, peeled
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Olive oil
MMMMM-----------------------PICO DE GALLO----------------------------
1 c  Chopped tomatoes
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
1/2    Jalapeno chili, minced
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Olive oil
4    Skinless boneless chicken
-breast halves
Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Grated Monterey Jack cheese
-(about 6 oz)
Avocado slices
FOR SAUCE: Boil 1 1/2 C water, ancho chilies, garlic cloves, salt and
dried oregano in heavy small saucepan until chilies are tender, about
5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove ancho chilies and garlic
cloves from cooking liquid; reserve cooking liquid. Discard stems and
seeds from chilies. Chop chilies coarsely. Transfer chilies and
garlic cloves to blender and puree until finely chopped. With machine
running, gradually add enough chili cooking liquid (about 1 C) to
form thick sauce. Add 1 T sugar and 1 t olive oil and blend until
sauce is smooth. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly
and refrigerate.)

FOR PICO DE GALLO: Combine tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno chili,
lemon juice and 1 T olive oil in small bowl. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and
refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 400'F and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or
preheat broiler. Brush chicken lightly with olive oil. Season with
salt and pepper. Grill or broil chicken just until cooked through,
brushing occasionally with ancho chili sauce, about 5 minutes per
side.

Transfer chicken to baking dish; brush with more sauce. Sprinkle
grated Monterey Jack cheese over. Bake just until cheese melts, about
3 minutes. Arrange chicken on plates. Top with pico de gallo. Garnish
with avocado slices. Serve, passing remaining ancho chili sauce
separately.
