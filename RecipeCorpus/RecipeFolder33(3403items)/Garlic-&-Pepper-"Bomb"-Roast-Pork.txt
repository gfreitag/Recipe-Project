Title: Garlic & Pepper "Bomb" Roast Pork
Categories: Meats, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
1/2 ts Ground cumin
2 ea Pork tenderloin; well-trimd
-(about 12 oz. each)
x  Salt
x  Freshly ground black pepper
4 ea Cloves garlic; minced
1 ea (to 2) Jalapenos; finely
-chopped
In a shallow dish just large enough to hold pork, stir together
yogurt and cumin.

Butterfly pork tenderloins by cutting down the length of the meat
halfway through, then opening it up like a book.  Season all sides of
the meat with salt and pepper; then sprinkle the garlic and jalapenos
over the cut sides of the meat.  Fold the tenderloins back to the
original shape and press so that the sides adhere.

Place the tenderloins in the yogurt marinade, turning to coat
completely. Refrigerate 1 to 3 hours, returning to room temperature
to cook.

Prepare a medium-hot fire.  Oil grill rack or coat with non-stick
vegetable spray.  Grill pork, turning occasionally and brushing with
marinade, for a total of 15 to 18 minutes, until cooked through.  Let
the meat stand about 5 minutes, then slice and arrange on a platter.
Makes 6 servings.

Melanie Barnard, Harper, $10), attributed to Gannett News Service.

Sorry about the mix-up in sources...the credit for Ms. Barnard's book
is given only <<after>> the heading for the recipe preceding this
one, and not before all of the grouped recipes, so I am uncertain
whether or not they're all from the same book.

Apologies to all from iRis gRayson.
