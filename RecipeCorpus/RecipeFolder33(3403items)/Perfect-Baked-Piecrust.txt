Title: Perfect Baked Piecrust
Categories: Pie/tart, Pastry
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
4 tb Cold water
1. Combine flour and salt in mixing bowl. Cut in solid shortening with
pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture is the size of small peas.
2. Use cold water only. Sprinkle water, a little at a time, on
mixture while constantly tossing with a fork. Add water to driest
parts while pushing lumps to sides, only until dough is just moist
enough to hold together. 3. Form into a ball, then flatten to
1/2-inch thick on lightly floured surface. Roll with rolling pin to
the size to fit your pie plate plus 1-1/2 inches. Roll from center
outwards each time. Smooth edges with hands to keep it round. 4. Fit
crust loosely into pan; flute edges and prick crust in several spots
with a fork. Pat out any air bubbles. Bake in a preheated 450-degree
oven for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Cool completely before
filling.
