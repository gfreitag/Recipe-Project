Crumble the bacon and set it aside.

Cook the beef, onion and garlic in the drippings until the meat
browns, stirring constantly.  Add the tomato paste, chopped green
chiles, masa harina, ground red chile peppers, salt, cumin, oregano
and water, stirring until well blended.  Bring to a boil, then reduce
the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours.  Stri in
the crumbled bacon and the beans.  Simmer for an additional 30
minutes. Serve the chili with your choice of condiments.

NOTE:  "Robert Follett uses pure ground chile peppers (not chili
powder, which is a spice blend) found easily in Utah supermarkets.
Check your produce section or gourmet shops for dried chile peppers,
and grind them in your blender or food processor (remove seeds
first).  Robert's chili is quite thick and could be rolled up in a
flour tortilla, burrito style."
