Temperature
Preheat oven at 350.  In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder,
sugar, and salt.  In another mixing bowl, combine oil, cheese, and
milk, stirring until mixture comes together to form a soft dough.
Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out dough until 1/2" thick.
Using a cutter of choice, cut out shapes, gently reroll the scraps,
to form 10 biscuits.  Place biscuits on unprepared baking sheet,
spacing 2" apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until biscuits are
pale golden brown and well risen.
