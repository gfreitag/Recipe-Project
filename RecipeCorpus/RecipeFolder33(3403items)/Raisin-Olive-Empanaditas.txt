Categories: Appetizers, Sandwich
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 lb Lean ground beef
1/4 c  Minced onions
2 tb Raisins -- chopped
2 tb Green olives -- chopped
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper
1/4 c  Cottage cheese
1    Hard-boiled eggs -- chopped
1 lg Egg -- separated
1 ts Water
1    Batch
2 ts Milk
Pastry dough
* Enough pastry to equal about a 10-inch double crust pie.

1. Saute ground beef in large skillet until browned. Drain, and to
the beef add the onions, raisins, olives, salt and pepper. Cover and
cook over low heat for 5 minutes.

2. Stir in cottage cheese and chopped hard cooked egg. Set aside.

3. Prepare pastry according to directions on container or make your
own recipe. Roll out the dough in two large circles (for easier
handling). Cut about 12 circles total, each about 3-1/2 inches in
diameter. Onto each circle place 2 teaspoons of filling. Brush edge
of dough with 1 egg white mixed with 1 teaspoon of water. Fold edges
over to make half-moon shape and seal with fork dipped in flour.

4. Place Empanaditas on ungreased cookie sheet. Blend the egg yolk
with the milk and brush this mixture on the tops of the Empanaditas.
Bake in preheated 375-degree oven until golden brown, about 15-18
minutes.
