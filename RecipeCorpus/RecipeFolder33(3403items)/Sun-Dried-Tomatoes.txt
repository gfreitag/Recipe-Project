Title: Sun Dried Tomatoes
Categories: Vegetables, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
1    Plum (Roma Tomatoes)
1    Pinch Salt
I do mine in the oven. It takes considerably more time, but is
incredibly easy & sensible considering plum tomatoes are $.39/kb and
dried are over $4/lb. Plum tomatoes (Roma), any quantity you desire.
Cut lengthwise. Removing stems is optional.   Sprinkle with a pinch
of salt, or less and arrange them on a flat cookie sheet, skin side
down. Place in an oven with the temperature set as low as you can get
it (100 F is perfect)> Preheating is not necessary and allow to dry
for four hours. At the end of 4 hours, check them, sometimes the ones
at the back of the oven will go faster than the front.  Turn the pan
if necessary. The tomatoes should have shrunk to about 1/2 their
thickness, but still have some moisture in the center. Gently prick
them with a fork on the cut edge, not the skin. Continue to dry them
until they have the consistency of a dried apricot, about 2-4 hours
more. Just be careful that they don't get too dry or that the heat is
too high. Hard tomatoes are not enjoyable, and too much heat will
ruin the texture.  To store them, put them into a container that will
breathe for short term, or store them in the 'fridge in olive oil for
long term. They are especially good right out the oven on grilled
hamburgers or chopped up inside hamburgers.
