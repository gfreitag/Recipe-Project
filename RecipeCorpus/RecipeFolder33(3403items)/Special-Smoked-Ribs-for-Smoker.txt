Directions: Cut ribs in 5-6 rib sections and set aside.  Combine
remaining ingredients in a saucepan and heat until sugar melts and
mixture is well-blended.  Pour mixture over ribs and marinate 5-7
hours. Remove ribs from mixture and place on smoker grid or in a rib
rack on the grid. Brush with mixture once again before smoking. If
you are using a double grid smoker, the ribs on the top grid will
cook faster. CHARCOAL:  Use 7-8 lbs. of charcoal, 4 quarts hot water,
