Title: Raisin Cinnamon Bread For Abm
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 pk Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
2 ts Vital gluten -- * see note
1 tb Wheat germ
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 tb Margarine
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 1/4 c  Milk -- at room temperature
1/2 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Dried apricots
* Vital gluten can be found at health food stores and at some grocery
stores. It helps to make the bread rise and gives it a tender texture.

Chop the apricots into small pieces, or use dates if you prefer.
Place all ingredients except raisins and apricots (or dates) into
your breadmaker following manufacturer's directions. Add the raisins
and apricots at appropriate time; in a Zojirushi and most other
breadmakers, there is an option for raisin bread that will allow the
machine to beep when it is time to add additional ingredients.
