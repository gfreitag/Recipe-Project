Title: Las Cruces Baked Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
4    Chicken breasts
7 oz Green chiles
1/4 lb Monterey jack cheese
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Garlic salt
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Lemon pepper
1/2 c  Grated bread crumbs
6 tb Margarine
1. Cut chicken breasts in half; bone and remove skin. Place waxed
paper over each chicken breast and flatten to about 1/4 inch thick,
using a meat mallet. 2. Drain, rinse and remove seeds from the canned
chiles. Cut chiles and the jack cheese into 8 pieces. Put a piece of
chili and a slice of cheese on each chicken breast. Tuck in sides and
roll. 3. In a shallow bowl, combine Parmesan cheese, chili powder,
garlic salt, cumin, lemon-pepper seasoning, and the dry bread crumbs.
Blend well. In another shallow bowl place the melted margarine. 4.
Dip each rolled chicken breast carefully into the melted margarine
then into crumb-cheese mixture. Place, seam-side down, in a 9 x
13-inch baking pan; keep chicken breasts from touching. Drizzle with
remaining margarine. 5. Refrigerate, covered with foil, 30-45 minutes
(this is a very important step!). Bake, uncovered, in preheated
400-degree oven for 25 minutes.
