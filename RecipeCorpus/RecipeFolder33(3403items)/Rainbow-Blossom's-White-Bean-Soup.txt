*Note: Colombo said that to make the vegetable stock, she cooked a
carrot, onion, potato, rib of celery and a few sprigs of parsley in 1
1/4 quarts water.  When the vegetables were tender, she pureed them
in the blender and added all to the beans.  "The soup was delicious,"
she said.

Place beans and water in a large kettle.  Cook 1 hour.  While beans
are cooking, prepare vegetables.

In a large skillet, heat olive oil.  Add onion, garlic, celery,
carrot, mushrooms and potato.  Saute lightly.  Add to the beans along
with herbs, salt and peppers.  Go light on the herbs at first - you
can always add more.  Add vegetable stock.

Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours or
until beans are tender.  Add the squash in the last 20 minutes of
cooking. Adjust seasonings and serve.

Yield: Approximately 2 to 2 1/2 quarts.
