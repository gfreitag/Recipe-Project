1 c  Boiling water
1/4 c  Cold water

3 ea Tb Shortening
Vegetable oil for pan frying
MEASURE FLOUR into a large mixing bowl; add boiling water, stirring
quickly with chopsticks or fork, then add cold water and mix well.
Work dough until smooth and supple. Roll dough into shape of a ball.
Cover well with plastic wrap or damp cloth; set aside to rest for 1
hour at room temperature. Knead dough until smooth and divide equally
into 16 pieces; cover with plastic wrap.  Work 1 piece of dough at a
time, keeping the rest covered in plastic wrap.  Take a piece of
dough and rub both sides with a bit of shortening, then roll out with
a rolling pin to 6 inches in diameter. Again rub shortening (about 1
teaspoon) onto 1 side of the dough; sprinkle evenly with about 1
teaspoon minced scallions and a pinch of salt. Curl up the dough from
1 end into a long, narrow cylinder; then curl up again lengthwise
into a snail-like cylinder. Place the dough on its broad side and
roll out again with a rolling pin into a piece about 4 inches in
diameter. Place one portion of filling in center of dough and seal
well on top by pinching the dough like a dumpling. Flatten into a
2-inch-diameter onion pancake. Set aside. Repeat until all the dough
is prepared. Pan fry the onion pancakes in a thin layer of hot
vegetable oil over medium heat, about 2 minutes on each side or until
golden brown. Pat the onion pancakes gently with a paper towel to
remove excess oil before serving. Makes 16 Pancakes, or 8 Servings
