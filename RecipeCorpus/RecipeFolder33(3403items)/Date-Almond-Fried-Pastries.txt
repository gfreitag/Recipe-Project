Title: Date-Almond Fried Pastries
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 16 servings
3/4 c  Chopped dates
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ds Salt
3/4 c  Almonds -- chopped
8 oz Crescent Dinner Rolls* --
8 oz Tube
1    Egg yolk
1 ts Water
2 ts Sesame seeds
* 8-ounce tube of refrigerated crescent dinner rolls.

Combine dates, water, sugar and salt; simmer until thick, stirring
frequently. Cool and stir in the almonds. Open package of rolls and
carefully unroll half without separating at perforations. Place
unrolled dough on lightly floured board. Fold one rectangle of dough
over the other, so that perforations are in opposite directions. Roll
dough to a very thin rectangle, 7 x 14 inches. Cut in half, then cut
each half into four 3-1/2 inch squares. Place a rounded teaspoon of
filling on each square. Moisten edges of dough; fold dough in half
over filling and shape into crescent. Repeat with second half of
package. Beat egg yolk lightly with water. Brush over pastries;
sprinkle with sesame seeds. Heat shortening to 360 degrees. Fry
pastries a few at a time for about 4 minutes, turning frequently.
Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.
