Title: Apricot Chicken Bake
Categories: Poultry, Healthy
Yield: 6 servings
6    Chicken breast halves
1 c  Apricot nectar
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1/8 ts Ground ginger
1/4 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Apricot preserves
3 tb Pecans -- toasted
Have the chicken breasts skinned and boned. Place the chicken in an
oven-proof pan large enough that the chicken will not be overlapping.
Combine the next 5 ingredients and pour over the chicken, turning the
chicken to get the marinade over all parts. Cover tightly and
refrigerate overnight or at least 8 hours. Remove from refrigerator
and let stand for 30 minutes. Cover tightly with foil and bake in
preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Uncover, drain and discard
liquid from chicken, and keep warm. Heat apricot preserves and brush
over chicken. Bake, uncovered, 20-30 minutes longer, basting with
preserves another 2 times. Remove to serving platter and sprinkle
with toasted pecans.
