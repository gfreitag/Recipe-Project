Title: Green Chili-Cheese Souffle
Categories: Casseroles, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Monterey Jack cheese
3    Eggs
4 oz Green chili peppers --
Chopped
1 c  Buttermilk baking mix
3 c  Milk
1 tb Black olives -- * chopped
1 tb Sun-dried tomatoes -- ** see
Note
* Optional but highly recommended

** If using oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drain, pat dry, and chop.
If using the dry ones, rehydrate in a little hot water for a few
minutes, drain, pat dry and chop.
The directions specify use of a food processor; a blender will work
but processing times must be increased.

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 1-1/2 quart souffle dish or
baking dish.

2. Fit the shredding disk into the work bowl. Shred cheese. Remove
from the bowl and set aside. Fit the steel knife blade into the bowl.
Combine eggs, chiles, baking mix and milk in bowl. Process until
mixed well, 6-8 seconds. If chiles are whole, process mixture until
chiles are chopped into 1/4-inch pieces, about 15 seconds.

3. Pour mixture into prepared dish. Add shredded cheese and stir
gently to mix well. Bake about 1 hour or until souffle is puffed and
dry on top.
