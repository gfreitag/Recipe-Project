Categories: Holiday
Yield: 3 servings
MMMMM--------------------SUPPLIES NEEDED-----------------------------
3    Jars Ball (#14400-81400)
(12 oz)
8    New lids - don't use old
Ones
8    Rings okay to use old ones
MMMMM-------------------------BATTER----------------------------------
1 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/3 c  Margarine -- at room
Temperature
1/4 c  Water
3 tb Cocoa powder -- sifted
1/4 c  Buttermilk* -- at room
Temperature
1    Egg white -- whipped
1/2 ts Vanilla
Preheat oven at 325.  Place a baking sheet onto middle rack and
remove top rack from oven.  Before starting batter, wash jars, lids,
and rings in hot soapy water and let drain, dry, and cool to room
temperature.  Generously prepare inside of jars with margarine  To
prepare batter, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, and cinnamon in a
mixing bowl.  In another mixing bowl, combine margarine, water, cocoa
powder, buttermilk, egg white, and vanilla. Divide batter among 3
jars (should be slightly less than half full). Carefully wipe rims
clean, then place jars on baking sheet (or they'll tip over) in the
center of oven.  Bake 40 minutes.  Keep lids in hot water until
they're used.  When cakes are done, remove jars which are HOT from
oven one at a time.  If rims need cleaning, use moistened paper
towel. Carefully put lids and rings in place, then screw tops on
tightly shut. Place jars on a wire rack; they will seal as they cool.

Once jars are cool, decorate with round pieces of cloth and then glue
on flowers, ribbons, etc. on lid, ring and side of jar.  Unscrew the
ring (the lid should be sealed by now) and place a few cotton balls
on top of the lid (makes it poofy on top), then a piece of cloth
(about 3" larger than the lid) on top and screw the ring back on.
Decorate as desired (example pinking shears).
