Variation of Bean Burger calling for Kidney Beans posted on Intercook
by Sandee Eveland.  I didn't have all the right ingredients for that
recipe so experimented with black beans instead.

Mix all ingredients well.  Using 1/4 lb hamburger press, make four
burgers.

Can vary the taste with more/less spices.

Preheat electric skillet to 350 degrees.  Spray with vegetable spay.
Fry burgers about 15 minutes, turning once or twice until surface is
golden brown and burger feels "set"

The consistency of these burgers "May" allow them to be grilled on
bbq if using a gas grill over low heat.

Will have son evaluate this experiment. These passed the taste test!
