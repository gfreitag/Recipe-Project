This relish is one of those funny things that happen every once in a
while: You come up with an idea that looks and sounds really strange,
then when you make it, the flavor turns out to be not only unique but
truly tasty. The mixture is very strong with vinegar and garlic, but
when you bite into the grapes, the resulting bursts of sweetness
balance the flavor.

Mix 'em all together. That's it. This relish will keep, covered and
refrigerated, for 3 or 4 days.
