Title: Snow Eggs
Categories: Desserts, Alcohol
Yield: 8 servings
5    Egg whites
2 tb Powdered sugar
1/2 ts Orange extract
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Whole milk
3 tb Granulated sugar
3    Egg yolks
Wine -- optional
Beat the egg whites until you can turn the bowl upside down without
the whites falling out. Gradually add the powdered sugar, 1/4
teaspoon orange extract and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract or other
flavoring. (Thomas Jefferson used orange flower or rose water.) Put
milk into a 10-inch heavy skillet and add the granulated sugar and
remaining orange and vanilla extracts. Slowly bring to a simmer. Drop
tablespoonfuls of egg white into hot milk and poach until set. Turn
the mounds after about 1-2 minutes of cooking. You will need to make
these in batches as it won't all fit in skillet at once. The egg
whites will puff a bit while cooking. It should take about 4-5
minutes for each batch to cook. Lay them on a wire rack to drain.
Beat the egg yolks until thick. Add a small amount of the hot milk to
the yolks, then stir gradually into the milk. Continue to stir while
cooking, until the custard thickens. Pour custard through a sieve.
Put the cooked whites in a serving dish and pour the custard over
them. Serve immediately.
