powdered tempra paints

Divide the shampoo into two or more portions (depending on number of
children who will playing). Stir in enough tempra paints to make a
medium-density color. Outside: The children can smooth this onto their
bodies, lathering to make shapes and designs. This comes off easily by
running through the sprinklers. From: Carl Berger Date: 12-03-93
