Title: Caramelized Rum Bananas
Categories: Fruit, Alcohol
Yield: 6 servings
4 tb Butter
6    Bananas
1/2    Lemons -- juice only
1/2 c  Honey
1 1/2 tb Dark rum
Ground cinnamon -- optional
1. Butter a baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter; or use solid
margarine, not the soft diet type. 2. Peel bananas and leave whole or
cut into 3-inch pieces. Place in a single layer. Sprinkle with the
juice of 1/2 lemon. Pour honey on top evenly and dot with remaining 3
tablespoons butter. 3. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for about 20
minutes. Turn bananas once or twice as they are baking. Sprinkle with
cinnamon or a few grains of nutmeg if you prefer. 4. Just before
serving, heat rum carefully and ignite. Pour over bananas and serve
immediately.
