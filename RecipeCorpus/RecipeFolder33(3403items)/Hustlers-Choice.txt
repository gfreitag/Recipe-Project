Title: Hustlers Choice
Categories: Alcohol, Mixed drink, Beverages
Yield: 1 servings
2 oz Ginger ale
1 oz Club soda
I made up the name for this. Sometimes pool hustlers and other
gamblers like to look as though they are drinking alcohol when they
are actually remaining sober. One of the prime choices is half and
half club soda and ginger ale. It looks like a Scotch and soda, and a
well-tipped waitress will bring you this harmless concoction in the
same glass as is used to serve a Scotch and soda whenever you order a
Scotch and soda, and no one is the wiser.
