Cuban garlic-citrus sauce, pronounced mo-ho, is Cuba's national table
sauce, served on just about everything.

NOTE: Sour orange juice can be found in Latino markets.

Heat the olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Add the
garlic and cook until fragrant and lightly toasted but not brown,
about 30 seconds.

Add the sour orange juice, cumin, and salt and pepper. Stand back; The
sauce may sputter. Bring the sauce to a rolling boil. Correct the
seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste.

Cool before serving. Moho tastes best when served within a couple of
hours of making, but it will keep for several days, covered, in the
refrigerator. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
