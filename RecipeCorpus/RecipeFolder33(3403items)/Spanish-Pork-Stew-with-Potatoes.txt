4 md Potatoes
1 lb Tomatoes
1    Bell peppers
2 tb Vinegar
1 lb Pork shoulder butt
3    Garlic cloves, crushed
1 c  Stock
1    Bay leaves
1 md Onions, chopped
Cut pork into large chunks.  Coarsely chop tomatoes.  Peel potatoes
and cut into thick chunks.  Seed, core, and thinly slice bell pepper.

Brown pork in 2 tb oil if desired.  Layer ingredients in crockpot in
order; cook until meat is tender, about 10 hours.

Stovetop preparation: Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
pork and saute a few minutes, until lightly browned.  Add garlic and
saute well. Add onion and saute until tender.  Add tomatoes and cook
5 minutes. Att water, vinegar, and bay leaf. Salt and pepper to
taste. Bring to boil. Cover and simmer until pork is almost tender,
about 40 minutes. Stir in green pepper. Add potatoes around sides and
simmer, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes.  Avoid stirring or
overcooking potatoes.

Sylvia's comments: this was easy to fix, and the only problem was
that it was just a hair bland.  I added some Worcestershire to my
bowl, and it was fine.  I used balsamic vinegar and sliced the onion
instead of chopping it so it was easier to pick out.  I also used
canned tomatoes. With the added stock, it was more soup than stew.
