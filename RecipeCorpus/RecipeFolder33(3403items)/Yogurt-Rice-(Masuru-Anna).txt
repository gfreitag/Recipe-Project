Categories: Indian, Low cal/fat, Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Basmati rice
1 c  Plain yogurt
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Canola oil
1/2 ts Black mustard seeds
1/4 ts Split urad dal
10    Curry leaves -- optional
2    Dried red chilies
2    Chili pepper -- minced
1 1/2 ts Ginger root -- minced
1 tb Coriander leaves -- finely
Chopped
Place rice in large bowl.  Cover with water.  Swish water around to
remove starch coating.  Let the rice sit so any husks will float to
the top. Drain and continue rinsing until the water is clean and
clear. Add enough warm water to bowl to cover by at least 1".  Soak
the rice for at least 20 minutes to allow the grains to absorb
moisture and relax prior to cooking. Drain.  Bring 10 cups of water
to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the rice and stir.  Bring to a
boil.  Boil vigorously until the rice is cooked and slightly soft,
about 20 minutes. Drain and place in a bowl. In another bowl, combine
the yogurt and salt until creamy and smooth. Add the yogurt to the
hot rice.  Gently stir to mix. Heat the oil in a small non-stick
skillet over moderate flame.  Add the mustard seeds. As soon as they
crackle, add the urad dal.  When the dal turns light golden brown,
add the curry leaves and red chilies.  Cook until the chilies start
to darken. Remove from heat and pour mixture over the rice.  Stir
gently to mix. Do not refrigerate.  Serve the yogurt rice at room
temp. 236 calories and 3 grams fat.
