Recipe by: The Elegant Entertaining Cookbook by Myra In a glass bowl,
place chicken pieces. Combine 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 tablespoon
cornstarch. Blend in beaten egg white. Pour over chicken and toss to
coat well. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour. In a small bowl,
combine remaining soy sauce, vinegar, white wine, and 1 tsp.
cornstarch; mix until smooth. Stir in sugar, sesame oil and salt.

In a wok heat oil. Deep-fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, about 1
minute, or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towel. Pour
all but 2 tablespoons oil out of wok. To the wok, add chili peppers,
garlic and ginger; stir-fry 1 minute. Pour sauce mixture into wok and
cook, stirring, about 1 minute, until thickened. Return chicken
pieces to wok. Mix well and serve immediately.

Makes 2 servings. I like to serve this with rice and Sauteed Snow
Peas and Red Peppers. The chicken is spicy hot with the dried chili
peppers, so adjust to your taste. Enjoy!
