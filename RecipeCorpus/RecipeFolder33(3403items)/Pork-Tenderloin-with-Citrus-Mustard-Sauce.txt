Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Pork tenderloin

1/3 c  Orange juice
3 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Honey
1 tb Dijon mustard
1 ts Finely chopepd fresh ginger

Preheat your grill until the coals are medium hot.

While the grill is heating make the sauce by combining orange juice,
soy sauce, honey, Dijon, ginger and garlic in a medium saucepan (or
microwaveable bowl) and heating until warm. Gently stir in the orange
and grapefruit segments, being careful not to break. Keep sauce warm
over a low heat until the pork has been grilled.

Trim any fat from the pork and season with salt and pepper. Place
tenderloins on grill for 12-15 minutes, rolling every 3-4 minutes to
brown evenly.

If you prefer the tenderloin well-done, leave on an additional 4
minutes.

Remove the tenderloins from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes.
Slice into 3/8"-thick rounds and place on a platter or individual
serving plates. Top with the citrus sauce and orange and grapefruit
segments. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
