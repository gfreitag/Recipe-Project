Title: Tuna-Cheese Salad Mold
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Salads
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Water
2 pk Gelatin -- 1 tbsp each
1 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 c  Mayonnaise
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Onions -- minced
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper
7 oz Canned tuna -- 1 can
1/2 c  Toasted almonds -- slivered
1/2 c  Olives -- pitted
* This recipe calls for stuffed green olives, but black olives are
also good if you prefer them.

1. Place the 1/2 cup cold water in a small bowl, add gelatin and let
stand 5 minutes to soften. 2. In a saucepan, heat the broth until
very hot, add the softened gelatin and stir to dissolve. 3. In a
large bowl place the 1 cup mayonnaise; add gelatin mixture slowly,
stirring constantly. Next, blend in 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, lemon
juice, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Chill until
mixture is slightly thickened. 4. Lightly oil a 1 quart mold with
salad oil; do not use olive oil. Use a fish mold if you can for an
impressive dish. Invert the mold to drain excess oil. 5. If using
almonds, blanch, sliver then toast, or buy already prepared ones.
Drain and flake a 7-ounce can of tuna. Have ready 1/2 cup of sliced
olives. 6. Fold the tuna, almonds and olives gently into the gelatin
mixture. Place the mixture into the greased mold and chill until
firm. Unmold onto a bed of lettuce and decorate, using olives for the
"eyes".
