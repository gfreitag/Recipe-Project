Title: Dill Yeast Bread
Categories: Breads, Healthy
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Cottage cheese
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Onion flakes
1 tb Fresh dill weed -- * see
Note
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
2    Eggs
1 pk Yeast -- not instant
2 1/2 c  Bread flour
1/2 ts Margarine -- melted
* Use dried dill weed or dill seeds if preferred.

Have eggs at room temperature. Heat the cottage cheese until barely
warm to touch, about 110 degrees. Mix the cottage cheese in large
bowl along with sugar, onion, dill, salt, baking soda, eggs and
yeast. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff batter. Beat
well after each addition with an electric mixer flat beater, or use a
wooden spoon if mixing by hand. Since this is a heavy batter, not a
dough, it will not be kneaded. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and
let rise in warm place for 1 hour or more. Remove the plastic wrap
and stir down the batter with 20-25 strong strokes. Spoon the batter
into a greased 1-1/2 quart casserole dish. Cover with wax paper and
leave until the batter doubles in size, about 45 minutes. Keep the
waxed paper from touching the batter or it may collapse when the
paper is pulled away. Bake in a PREHEATED 350-degree oven for 40-45
minutes or until deep brown and crusty. Test with a wooden toothpick
and if it does not come out clean, then bake 5-8 minutes longer.
Remove bread from oven and immediately brush with the margarine.
Sprinkle with salt if desired. You might use coarse salt as an
interesting variation.
