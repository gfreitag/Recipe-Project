Title: Barfi Badam (Almond Cream Sweetmeat)
Categories: Desserts, Indian
Yield: 16 pieces
4 c  Milk
3/4 c  Sugar
125 g  Blanched almonds, pulverised
In blender, or 1 cup ground
Almonds
Pinch of ground cardamom
2 tb Blanched pistachio nuts
Edible silver leaf-optional
In a heavy-based saucepan or large frying pan boil the milk over
fairly high heat, stirring all the time, until it is reduced and very
thick. Add sugar and stir for 10 minutes on low heat. Add the ground
almonds and continue to cook and stir until the mixture comes away
from sides and base of pan in one mass. Remove from heat, sprinkle
cardamom over and mix well. Turn on to a greased plate. Smooth top
with back of butter spoon. Cool slightly, mark in diamond shapes with
knife and decorate with halved pistachio nuts and sliver leaf.

Before it is quite firm cut with sharp knife along the markings then
leave to get quite cold before separating into pieces.
