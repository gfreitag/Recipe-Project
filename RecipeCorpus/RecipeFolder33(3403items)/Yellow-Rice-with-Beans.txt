Recipe by: Rice The Amazing Grain Preparation Time: 0:30 To make
beans, combine 10 cups of water, green pepper, and 1 garlic clove.
Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are
tender enough to crush with a spoon on the side of pan and most of the
liquid is absorbed, about 2 1/2 hours.  Meanwhile, heat oil in a
medium skillet over low heat.  Add onions, green pepper, red pepper,
and remaining garlic cloves.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring,
until onions and peppers are golden, about 15 minutes.  Season with
cumin and black pepper. Stir cooked vegetables into the beans.  Cook
for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring often and adding as much of the
chicken broth as needed to keep the beans a thick consistency without
sticking.  Taste and correct the seasoning. To cook rice, heat 1/4
cup broth to boiling in a small saucepan. Cover and let stand for 5
minutes.  Meanwhile, in a saucepan heat oil over low heat. Add rice
and garlic, and cook, stirring, just until rice is coated and the
garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Do not brown. Stir in turmeric,
remaining broth and broth mixture.  Heat to boiling, stirring once.
Cook covered, over low heat until broth is absorbed and rice is
tender, about 12 minutes.  Spoon rice into large serving platter.
