FOR GNOCCHI: Cook potato in medium saucepan of boiling salted water
until very tender, about 30 minutes. Drain.

Return potato to pan and mash. Add pumpkin, salt, pepper and ground
nutmeg. Stir mixture over medium heat until very dry, about 5
minutes. Remove mixture from heat. Stir in 1 1/4 C flour; add more
flour by tablespoonfuls if necessary to form smooth but slightly
sticky dough. Transfer dough to generously floured surface and knead
gently until smooth, about 2 minutes.

Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets. Roll out dough to 9-inch square,
about 1/2 inch thick. Cut into 1-inch-wide strips. Using palms of
hands, roll each strip into 1/2-inch-diameter rope. Cut each rope
into 1 1/4-inch-long pieces. Arrange gnocchi on prepared sheets. (Can
be made 1 day ahead. Dust lightly with flour, cover with plastic and
refrigerate.)

Line 2 large baking sheets with foil. Working in batches, cook
gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until gnocchi rise to
the top, about 2 1/2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to
colander and drain. Arrange gnocchi on prepared sheets. (Gnocchi can
be cooked 2 hours ahead. Cover with plastic and let stand at room
temperature.)

Add gnocchi to warm sauce in skillet and toss over medium heat until
heated through and coated with sauce, about 2 minutes. Divide gnocchi
and sauce among 6 plates. Sprinkle gnocchi with cheese and parsley
and serve.
