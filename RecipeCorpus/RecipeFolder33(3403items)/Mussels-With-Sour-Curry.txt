7 lb Steamed mussels
4 c  Coconut milk
3 tb Flour
2    Eggs -- lightly beaten
3 tb Sour curry paste
1 tb Fish soy
2 tb White wine
1/2 ts Sugar
Remove mussels from shells and save the larger shells. Place 2-3
mussels in each shell, arrange them neatly on a baking dish and set
aside. Prepare sauce by warming coconut milk, flour and eggs. Add
curry paste, fish soy, wine and sugar and bring mixture to a boil
over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 3-5 minutes.
Divide half the sauce between the shells containing the mussels,
being sure to cover each shell with some sauce.  Bake at 400 F for 10
minutes or until surface of sauce begins to brown. Keep the remaining
sauce warm while the mussels bake. Put 4 Tbsp of sauce on each plate,
add mussels and serve hot.
