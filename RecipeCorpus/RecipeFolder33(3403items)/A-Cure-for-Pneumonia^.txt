Take 6-10 onions, according to size and chop fine. Put in a skillet
over a hot fire. Then add about the same quantity of rye meal and
vinegar, enough to make a thick paste. In the meantime, stir it
thoroughly, letting it simmer 5-10 minutes. Then put it in a cotton
bag large enough to cover the lungs, and apply to the chest as hot as
the patient can bear. When this gets cool, apply another and thus
continue by reheating the poultices, and in a few hours the patient
will be out of danger. this simple remedy has never failed in this
too often fatal malady. Usually four applications will do, but
continue always until perspiration starts freely from the chest.
