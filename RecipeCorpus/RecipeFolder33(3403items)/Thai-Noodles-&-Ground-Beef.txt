*GUA TEAW NUA SUB Cut noodles into 1" wide and 4" long strips. If
using dried noodles, bring a pot of water to a rapid boil and drop
the noodles in. Boil until soft, drain and rinse with cold water.
Stir-fry noodles in 2/3 oil and soy sauce over medium heat for 1 min.
or until the noodles are well coated with soy sauce. Arrange desired
amount of lettuce leaves in serving plates. Place noodles on top and
set aside. Add the remaining oil and fry garlic until golden brown.
Add ground beef and cook over medium-high heat until done. Add sugar,
fish sauce, ground pepper, curry powder and salted lettuce. Stir
well. Dissolve tapioca starch in chicken stock and pour into the
ground beef. Cook until the liquid become gravy-like and bubbly.
Remove from heat and spoon over the noodles. Sprinkle green onions
