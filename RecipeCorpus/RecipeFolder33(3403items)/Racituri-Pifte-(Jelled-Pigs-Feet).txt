Title: Racituri-Pifte (Jelled Pigs Feet)
Categories: Meats, Romanian
Yield: 1 servings
4 x  Pigs feet
1 tb Salt
2 x  Garlic cloves
Singe and thoroughly wash pigs feet. Place in pan with water to
cover and boil 15 min. Remove feet, rewash and place in pan, cover
with 4 quarts water and add salt. Boil slowly four hours or until
meat falls off bones.
Skim off any foam that forms so broth remains clear.
Crush garlic and add to meat/water for last half hour of cooking.
Remove meat from bones if desired and strain juice over meat in flat
plates. Put in a cold place to jell. Serve sprinkled with sweet
paprika or a little hot pepper(I'd use dried cayenne or serrano,
seeds an' all).
I've seen this served as a lunch with cheese & crackers and a ruby
red wine. Sounds ok to me!
