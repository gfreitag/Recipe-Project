Categories: Potatoes, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
2 lg Russett pototoes; peeled and
-cut into 1/2-inch cubes
-(about 1 lb. total)
1 tb Oriental sesame oil
3 md (5 to 6-oz. ea.) Onions;
-chopped
6 ea Cloves garlic; minced or
-pressed
3 ea Fresh jalapeno chilies;
-stemmed, seeded, and finely

2/3 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
-(coriander)
2 ts Ground cumin
3 tb Lime juice
8 lg Eggs, beaten to blend
x  ;Salt
x  ;Pepper
x  Salsa
x  Warm flour or corn tortillas
-(optional)
Pour 1 inch water into a 2- to 3-quart pan.  Add potatoes, cover and
bring to a boil over high heat; simmer until potatoes are tender when
pierced, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over
medium heat.  When oil is hot, add onions and garlic.  Stir often
until onions are limp, about 10 minutes.  Add chilies, cilantro, and
cumin; stir often for 1 to 2 minutes.

Mix potatoes and lime juice with ingredients in pan, then spread out
to make rather level.  Pour eggs over potatoes; as they cook, use a
wide spatula to scrape and lift firm portions from pan bottom, so
uncooked egg can flow beneath.  Cook until eggs are set as firmly as
you like. Scoop onto plates and season portions to taste with salt,
pepper and salsa, and accompany with tortillas.

Makes 6 servings.
