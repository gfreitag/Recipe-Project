Pat and Jeryl Hochstedler of Goshen, Indiana, fire up their grill,
getting set to compete at the Elkhart County Fair. Mushrooms and
cheese stuff their giant burger (8 inches in diameter), which serves
six.

1. In a mixing bowl, combine ground meat, Parmesan cheese, oregano,
lemon juice, teriyaki sauce and garlic salt.

2. Divide mixture in half. Shape each half into a ball, and pat onto
waxed paper to form a flat burger that's 8 inches in diameter.

3. Spread tomato paste in the center of one circle of meat. Add
mozzarella cheese and mushrooms. Top with second circle of meat. Seal
edges.

4. Cook on the grill rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium
coals for 30 to 35 minutes or till meat is medium to well done and no
pink remains. Use a wide spatula to turn the burger once halfway
through grilling time. Cut into wedges to serve.
