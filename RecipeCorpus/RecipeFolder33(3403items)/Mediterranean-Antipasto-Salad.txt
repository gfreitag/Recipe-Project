Title: Mediterranean Antipasto Salad
Categories: Salads, Meats, Cheese/eggs, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
No ingredients
To assemble salad, toss mixed greens (romaine, frisee, radicchio) with
dressing (choose from one of two recipes included here, or a favorite
of your own), grilled chicken (optional), tomatoes and chick peas.
Garnish with a dollop of baba ghanoush (recipe included), strips of
sliced roasted red and yellow bell peppers, a spoonful of marinated
olives (recipe included) and two slices of marinated chevre (recipe
included). Place triangles of warm grilled or toasted pita bread
around the salad.

Even those who don't want to go through so much effort just for one
salad might consider making a couple of these recipes and keeping the
olives (or chevre or baba ghanoush) on hand for guests, for snacking.
