Title: Pina Colada
Categories: Mixed drink, Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
1 oz Light rum
1 oz Coconut cream
1 oz Crushed pineapple
1/4 c  Crushed ice
1    Orange slice
1    Maraschino cherry
Place all ingredients in a blender and blend at high setting until
smooth -- about 30 seconds. Strain into highball or collins glass and
garnish with orange slice and cherry.

NOTE: Crushed pineapple juice canned in its own syrup is preferable
for a less-sweet drink; use pineapple canned in juice for a sweeter
concoction.
