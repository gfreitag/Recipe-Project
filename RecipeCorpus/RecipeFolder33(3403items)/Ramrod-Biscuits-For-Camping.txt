Title: Ramrod Biscuits For Camping
Categories: Breads, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Biscuit mix
1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk, instant
2/3 c  Water
Honey
Jelly
* Have a good campfire going before mixing these biscuits. Also have
some smooth dry sticks about 3/4 inch in diameter ready. Be careful
to know what kind of wood is safe -- NEVER use Oleander wood.

Mix the biscuit mix (such as Bisquick) and dry milk together and take
camping in a plastic baggie or in a bowl with lid so that you can
just make the biscuits in the same container. Take along some honey
or jelly for eating with this. Mix only enough of the water into the
dry ingredients to make a stiff dough. Divide into 6 portions and
shape dough around the end of each stick. Roast over the fire until
golden brown. Remove from stick and fill with honey or jelly if
desired.
