End of Pt. 2
This recipe is the closest I've found to what I get at my favorite
Thai restaurant in Denver. I usually double the recipe because I've
never served more than 2-3 people on one batch and I love the
leftovers. If you aren't familiar with Thai cooking you may be
tempted to leave out the fish sauce or substitute ketchup. DON'T! The
results are not the same. This recipe is served over the bean sprouts
although they can be mixed in depending on your preference. To get
the best results from your sprouts put them in a large bowl filled
with cold water and ice cubes and let them soak for about 15 minutes
or so. This revives them and makes them really crunchy. In Thailand
this dish is usually made with dried shrimp but for American
preferences fresh is usually used.  This recipe is altered slightly
from the book to make it like what I'm so addicted to at J's noodles.
It's long and the first time I made it, it took me close to an hour
but now I can make a double batch in about 25 minutes. I do all the
prep while the noodles soak.
