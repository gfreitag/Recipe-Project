The culinary influence of the many Chinese laborers who flocked to
Cuba in the mid-19th century can be seen in this roast pork dish,
which mixes those beloved Cuban black beans with Asian seasonings.

Preheat oven to 425'F. Rinse pork and pat dry. Place on rack in a
roasting pan and fill bottom of pan with 1" of water.

In a mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, sherry, hoisin sauce, black
beans, five-spice powder, garlic and sugar. Mix well. Coat pork loin
with mixture, rubbing meat all over until the mixture is used up.
Roast pork 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 325'F. and cook 1 - 1 1/2
hours, basting every 15 minutes with honey and water mixture. When
done, remove from oven and let cool clightly. Transfer to serving
platter. Serves 6-8. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
