Stick a knife into each roast in several places, making a deep
puncture. With fingers, push 1 clove garlic in each hole, then a long
pepper and a green onion.  Slice the pepper and onion off even with
the surface of the meat.  Sprinkle the roasts with salt and red
pepper.  When you get your fire going and are ready to put the meat
on the smoker cooker, place some pre-soaked smoking wood (such as
pecan or hickory) on the briquets.  Place seasonings in water pan,
then add water all the way to the top of the pan. Place beef roast,
then pork roast, in cooker and let them cook.  I usually put these on
about 11 P.M. and let them cook while I sleep.  One 10-lb bag of
charcoal will usually do.

AU JUSTIN GRAVY

Cup
1/2
juice from smoker cooker

After making a small roux, add enough cold water to blend roux.  Then
add as much juice from smoker cooker pan as you wish.  It has all the
juice and the tasty fat from the meat that was cooked.  Simmer,
stirring frequently, until gravy thickens slightly.  Serve over rice.
