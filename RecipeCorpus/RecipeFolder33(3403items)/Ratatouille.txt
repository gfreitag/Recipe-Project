Title: Ratatouille
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Onion -- sliced thin
1    Eggplant -- sliced
2    Zucchini -- sliced
2    Summer squash -- sliced
2    Tomatoes, red ripe --
Chopped
3 ts Thyme
2    Bay leaves
Put the onion into a large saucepan, cover, and cook over low heat
until translucent.  Add the eggplant and squashes, cover, and cook
until medium soft (not completely cooked and limp.)  Add tomatos,
thyme, and bay leaves, cover, and simmer about a half hour, stirring
occasionally, until mixture is nice and juicy.

Note that this recipe is fat-free, so you don't have to feel too
guilty if you decide to put it into an oven proof bowl, cover the top
with grated cheese, and broil it until bubbly. . .;-)
