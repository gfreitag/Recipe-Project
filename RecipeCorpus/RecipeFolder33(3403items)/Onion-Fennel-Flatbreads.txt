Title: Onion-Fennel Flatbreads
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 breads
1/4 c  Unsalted butter; plus...
2 ts Unsalted butter
-- (room temperature)
1 1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1 c  Warm water
-- (105 F. to 115 F.)
1 pk Quick-rising yeast
1 ts Sugar
1 1/4 ts Salt
4 ts Fennel seeds
3 c  (about) all-purpose flour
Saute onions in butter or oil over medium-low heat. When onions are
tender, transfer to bowl of electric mixer fitted with dough hook.

Add 1 cup of warm water to onion.  Blend in yeast, sugar and salt.
Crush 2 teaspoons fennel seeds using a mortar and pestle; add to
onion mixture. Gradually mix in flour until you have a dough of
medium-soft consistency. Turn out dough onto floured surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes.  Cover dough and let
rest for 20 minutes.

Grease a heavy baking sheet.  Divide dough into 4 equal pieces and
roll each piece into a ball.  Flatten balls of dough to 3/4"
thickness and place on greased baking sheet.  Rub surface of each
bread with remaining butter or oil and lightly sprinkle with
remaining whole fennel seeds, pressing slightly to make seeds stick.
Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 F.  Bake breads until golden brown, about 25
minutes.
