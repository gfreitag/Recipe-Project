* Original recipe called for one 10-ounce can of tomato soup; I prefer
tomato sauce, but use soup if you wish, or try a mixture of the two.
The flavored tomato sauces are excellent.

Saute green pepper, onion, olives and garlic in margarine for 5
minutes (or mix olive oil for half the margarine). Add remaining
ingredients; mix well. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
