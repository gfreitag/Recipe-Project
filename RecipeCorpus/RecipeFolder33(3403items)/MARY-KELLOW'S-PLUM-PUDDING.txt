Title: MARY KELLOW'S PLUM PUDDING
Categories: British isl, Oldies, Desserts, Fruit, Puddings
Yield: 1 batch
1 lb Raisins stoned
1 lb Currants cleaned
1 lb Sugar brown
1 lb Suet chopped fine
1 lb Bread crumbs fine
1 lb Lemon, citron and
-orange peel cut fine
1    Nutmeg grated
Break in 12 eggs and mix all well, stirring a good while and adding 2
or 3 large handsful of flour and half a tea cup full of good liquor.
Scald your cloth and flour it well. Tie the pudding pretty tight. It
does not swell much. Boil 6 hours. -M.K.

Note: I have given the recipe exactly as it was written. I prefer to
boil the puddings in covered bowls. -M.W.

Mary Kellow a notable cook, somewhat like the famous Mrs. Beaton I
think. She tossed off measurements like a dozen eggs and a pitcher of
cream.
