Source: Southern Living Cookbook (electronic) Smokers, both charcoal
and electric, are fast becoming one of the most popular cooking
appliances. Long, slow cooking in a smoker with a self-basting water
pan guarantees succulent meats and frees you to do other things.
What's more, most people are delighted by distinctive flavors that
result from smoking. Not just hickory, but apple and maple wood from
your yard and herbs from your garden can all be used for rich, sweet
flavoring of smoked foods. Part of the fun of smoking foods is
experimenting with different flavorings. Leave space around each food
item on the grill to allow even cooking and smoke penetration.  Don't
open the smoker after everything is set, particularly during the
first few hours. You'll lose both smoke and moisture, and prolong the
cooking time required. Occasionally you may need to add more water to
the pan during cooking. You'll hear a sizzling sound if the pan is
empty, so don't lift the lid to check; simply pour water through the
grill. Cooking times will vary with the outside temperature, cut of
meat, quality of charcoal, and degree of doneness you desire. Color
is not an accurate test for doneness.  Smoked pork and poultry are
often pink even though they're thoroughly cooked. For large cuts of
meat, it's best to use a meat thermometer to determine internal
temperature and degree of doneness. Submitted By SALLIE KREBS   On
