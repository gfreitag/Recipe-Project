Title: Crab and Eggplant Dressing
Categories: Cajun/creol, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 8 servings
4 lg Eggplants
2 tb Bacon fat
2 lg Onions
1/2 c  FRESHLY grated Romano cheese
2 lg Onions
Seasoned bread crumbs
2    Stalks celery, chopped
2 lb (lump) crabmeat or fresh
-shrimp
Salt to taste
Red pepper to taste
1 lg Bell pepper
Peel and cube eggplants. Soak in cold salted water. Drain and cook in
large Dutch oven in bacon fat for 1 hour over medium heat; then add
salt, red pepper, onions, bell pepper and celery. Continue cooking
until thoroughly done. We use a potato masher to break up eggplant
while cooking. If using fresh shrimp, cook additional 10 minutes. If
lump crabmeat (or ham) is used, stir in without cooking. Add enough
seasoned bread crumbs to absorb liquid. Stir in 1/2 cup Romano cheese
(Grated cheese refrigerates well in jar). Place in 2 quart casserole
and top lightly with more crumbs and cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for
30 minutes. Hungry? Enjoy. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On
