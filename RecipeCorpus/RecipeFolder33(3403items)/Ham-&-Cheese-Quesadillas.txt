Categories: Sandwich, Meats, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Reduced-calorie mayonnaise
1 ts Honey mustard
ds Worcestershire sauce
ds Tabasco sauce
4    Corn tortillas (6")
4 oz Grated Swiss or Monterey
-Jack cheese
4 oz Sliced Virginia ham
1/4 c  Diced tomato
1    Scallion, thinly sliced
1 ts Vegetable oil
If you are a tomato lover, cut thin slices instead of dicing and lay
them on top of the ham to cover, the sprinkle with scallions.

1. Combine first 4 ingredients in a small bowl. Spread each tortilla
with 1/2 tablespoon of this mixture; reserve.

2. Sprinkle 2 tortillas each with 1 ounce grated cheese. Cover with
ham and sprinkle with diced tomato and scallion. Sprinkle remaining
cheese evenly over the tops and cover each with a reserved tortilla,
sauce-side down, to form 2 quesadillas. Flatten with the palm of your
hand.

3. Place 1/2 teaspoon oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat
until hot. Place a quesadilla in the skillet and cook, pressing down
with a spatula, 3-4 minutes per side or until the cheese melts and
the tortillas brown slightly. Repeat with remaining oil and second
quesadilla. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.
