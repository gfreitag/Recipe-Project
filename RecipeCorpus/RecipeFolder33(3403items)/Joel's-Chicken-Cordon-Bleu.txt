Title: Joel's Chicken Cordon Bleu
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
4    Chicken Breasts,
Deboned
1/4 c  All Purpose Flour
1/2 c  Dried Bread Crumbs
1    Egg
1 tb Dried Parsley
1/2 tb Chives, Chopped
1/2 ts Tarragon
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1 ts Garlic powder
4 sl Swiss cheese
4 sl Boiled ham
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
Preheat the deep fryer or, if baking in an oven, preheat the oven to
375 degree Place the deboned chicken breasts between two sheets of
waxed paper or plastic wrap. Use a meat mallet to flatten the
breasts. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Combine the chives, parsley
and tarragon in a bowl. Shred the ham slices. Dice the swiss cheese
slices. Add the shredded ham, diced swiss cheese and the first
measure of bread crumbs to the bowl. Mix thoroughly. Place the
chicken breasts meat side down on a work surface. Divide the the
stuffing mixture evenly between the breasts. Fold the breasts over
(taco style). Use toothpicks to hold the edges together. Beat the egg
in a wide, flat pan. Place the flour and second measure of bread
crumbs in shallow pans. Roll the stuffed breasts in the flour. Dip
the breasts in the beaten egg. Coat the breasts with the second
measure of bread crumbs. Deep fry until golden (if baking in the
oven, bake for 1 hour in a lightly greased baking dish). Remove the
toothpicks. Serve hot.
