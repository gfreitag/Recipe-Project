Chocolate-flavored syrup, as well as cinnamon and almond extract,
lends a Mexican accent to this award-winning treat from the Harms
family of Goshen, Indiana. Len, Loanne and David entered it at the
Elkhart County Fair.

1. In a bowl, beat eggs till frothy. Add the sugar and beat till
thick.

2. In a Dutch oven, heat half-and-half till almost boiling. Stir 1
cup of the hot half-and-half into eggs; pour all into a saucepan.
Cook and stir for 5 minutes or till mixture just comes to a boil
(watch carefully because mixture will foam).

3. Remove from heat and stir in the chocolate-flavored syrup, vanilla,
cinnamon and almond extract. Set mixture aside to cool slightly.
Cover and chill for 6 hours or overnight.

4. Stir in the whipping cream.

5. Freeze in a 4- or 5-quart ice cream freezer according to
manufacturer's directions.

Makes about 3 1/2 quarts.
