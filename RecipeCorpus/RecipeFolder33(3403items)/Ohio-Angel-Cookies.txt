These sugar-coated brown-sugar cookies from Doxie Damico of
Youngstown, Ohio, will please cookie lovers of all ages, just as they
did the judges at the Canfield Fair.

1. In a mixing bowl, beat shortening with an electric mixer on medium
to high speed for 30 seconds. Add the brown sugar, 1/2 cup sugar,
baking soda, cream of tartar and salt. Beat till mixed.

2. Beat in the egg and vanilla till the mixture is combined.

3. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Stir in any
remaining flour with a wooden spoon.

4. Shape into l-inch balls. Roll in the 1/2 cup sugar to coat. Place 2
inches apart on a greased baking sheet.

5. Bake in a 375-F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or till golden brown.
Remove cookies and cool completely on a wire rack.

Makes about 48 cookies.
