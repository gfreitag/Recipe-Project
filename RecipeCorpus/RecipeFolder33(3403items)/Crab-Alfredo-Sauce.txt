Title: Crab Alfredo Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 2 servings
MMMMM---------------------FROM: KATHY PITTS--------------------------
6 oz (To 8 oz) cooked snow crab
-meat, cut into chunks
4 tb Butter or margarine
4 tb Flour
2 c  Half-and-half (heavy cream
-if you REALLY feel wicked)
1/2 c  (About) grated Parmesan
-cheese (or more to taste)
Salt to taste
White pepper to taste
pn Cayenne pepper (optional)
Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in the flour, and cook briefly
until the mixture looks sandy. Do NOT let it color. Wisk in the half-
and-half, and stir until the mixture forms a thick sauce. Stir in the
cheese, and season to taste. Simmer for a few minutes to blend the
flavors, and stir in the crab meat. Cook JUST until the crab is
heated through.

Serve over cooked linguini, with additional Parmesan cheese and hot
red pepper flakes on the side.

Before some purist jumps me, I KNOW this isn't a classic Alfredo, but
it is a very good dish, and remarkably easy to make. This may be
varied by substituting cooked lobster meat for the crab, or by adding
36 cooked, peeled and deveined medium shrimp, and about a quarter of
a cup of chopped cooked broccoli instead of the crab meat.
