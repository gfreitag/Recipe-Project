Yield: 1 casserole
1 1/4 lb Ground beef
2/3    Stick butter
1 c  Diced onions
4    10 oz. boxes of frozen

1/2 c  Rice

1/4 c  Water
Start by putting the 1/2 cup of rice in the 1/4 cup of water.  In a
one cup measure, this should bring it up to the 3/4 cup mark.

In a large spaghetti pot, brown the meat in its own fat.  Remove the
meat and pour off the fat.

In that same pot, melt the butter and lightly brown the onions.  When
done, add the cooked meat.

Add the spinach.

Add the tomato sauce, salt, water, and the water and rice that has
been soaking.

Mix thoroughly, and then cover and let simmer on a low flame for 1
hour, stirring every 15 minutes.

If needed, keep juicy by adding a little water or tomato juice.

Serve with yogurt or sour cream and some French bread.

As with other casseroles, it tastes better on the second day.

This original Turkish dish was originally prepared by Ferihah Ceran,
and passed it down to her daughter-in-law Edith Ceran.  Edith passed
it down to her sons.  Enjoy.
