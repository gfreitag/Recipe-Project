Title: Hot Pepper & Garlic Spaghetti
Categories: Pasta/rice, Main dish, Vegetarian, Chilies
Yield: 4 servings
3 ea Chili Peppers, fresh or
Dried, chopped
9 ea Cloves Garlic, chopped
1/2 c  Water
1 lb Spaghetti
1/4 c  Olive Oil
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
Salt
Process the chili peppers, 6 of the garlic cloves & the water in a
food processor or blender until it makes a pungent, soup-like
mixture. Take care when opening up the top, as the fumes will be
strong.

Bring a large pan of boiling salted water to the boil. Pour the chili
& garlic mixture through a sieve into the boiling water; save or
discard the solids as desired. Add the pasta to this seasoned boiling
water & cook until *al dente*. Drain.

Toss the hot, drained pasta with the olive oil & the parsley. Season
with salt & serve.
