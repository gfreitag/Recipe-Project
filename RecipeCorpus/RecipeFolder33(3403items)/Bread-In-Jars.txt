Title: Bread In Jars: Zucchini
Categories: Holiday
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM--------------------SUPPLIES NEEDED-----------------------------
4    Wide mouth canning jars
(1 1/2 pt)
4    New lids - don't use old
Ones
4    Rings okay to use old ones
MMMMM-------------------------BATTER----------------------------------
3    Egg whites -- whipped
2 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Margarine -- at room
Temperature
2 c  Zucchini -- grated
1 ts Vanilla
3 c  Unbleached flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cloves
Preheat oven at 325.  Place a baking sheet onto middle rack and
remove top rack from oven.  Before starting batter, wash jars, lids,
and rings in hot soapy water and let drain, dry, and cool to room
temperature.  Generously prepare inside of jars with margarine.  To
prepare batter, combine flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder,
cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  In another mixing bowl, combine egg
whites, sugar, margarine, and zucchini. Divide batter among 4 jars
(should be slightly less than half full). Carefully wipe rims clean,
then place jars on baking sheet (or they'll tip over) in the center
of oven.  Bake 40 minutes.  Keep lids in hot water until they're
used.  When cakes are done, remove jars which are HOT from oven one
at a time.  If rims need cleaning, use moistened paper towel.
Carefully put lids and rings in place, then screw tops on tightly
shut. Place jars on a wire rack; they will seal as they cool.

Once jars are cool, decorate with round pieces of cloth.  Unscrew the
ring (the lid should be sealed by now) and place a few cotton balls
on top of the lid (makes it poofy on top), then a piece of cloth
(about 3" larger than the lid) on top and screw the ring back on.
Decorate as desired (example pinking shears).
