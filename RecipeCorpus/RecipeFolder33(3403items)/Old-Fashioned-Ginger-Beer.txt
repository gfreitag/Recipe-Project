Title: Old-Fashioned Ginger Beer
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Mixed drink
Yield: 1 servings
For The Starter-----
1/2 oz Yeast
2 ts Sugar
To Feed The "Plant"-----
7 ts Ground Ginger
7 ts Sugar
To Flavour-----
1 1/2 lb Sugar
Juice Of 2 Lemons
Mix starter ingredients with 3/4 pint of warm water in a glass jar.
Stir, cover and leave in a warm place for 24 hours. This is your
starter "plant".

Feed the "plant" with 1 teaspoon each of ground ginger and sugar each
day.

After 7 days strain through a fine sieve.  Dissolve the sugar in 2
pints of water.  Add the lemon juice and the liquid from the "plant".
Dilute with 5 pints of water, mix well and store in corked bottles
for at least 7 days.

Use strong bottles as pressure may build up which will cause thin
bottles to explode.  For the same reason use corked bottles rather
than those with a more secure closure that will not 'give' under
pressure.

Ross requested a recipe for ginger beer.  This is a recipe that I have
often used and it produces a really old-fashioned drink.  It is quite
a long process but well worth the effort.  The amount of sugar in the
final stage can be varied according to taste.  Please excuse the use
of Imperial measures - I am only a poor ignorant pom.
