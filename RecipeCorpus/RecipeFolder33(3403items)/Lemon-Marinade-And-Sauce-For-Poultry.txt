Title: Lemon Marinade And Sauce For Poultry
Categories: Poultry, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Brown sugar
2 ts Cornstarch
4 tb Lemon juice
5 tb Water
3 tb Soy sauce
1/4 c  Chopped green onions -- tops
Included
1/2 ts Garlic salt
1    Garlic clove -- minced
2 tb Margarine
1/2 ts Lemon pepper
Mix the cornstarch and brown sugar in a small saucepan. Stir in the
remaining ingredients except the onions. Blend well and heat to
boiling. Add the onions and immediately turn heat down. Stir
constantly until sauce is thickened and bubbling. Use this sauce to
baste poultry during last few minutes of grilling. You can also use
this sauce as a marinade. Put sauce in a heavy plastic bag along with
2 to 3 pounds of chicken pieces and marinate for from 2 hours to
overnight, turning bag to coat all sides of meat. Use the leftover
sauce to brush on chicken while grilling. This recipe doubles nicely.

Yield: 3/4 to 1 cup sauce/marinade.
