Title: CABBAGE, POTATOES & PEAS MOLAGOOTAL
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian, Potatoes
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Mung dal
1/2 sm Cabbage; chopped fine
1 lg Baking potato, diced
1 bn Frozen peas
1 ts Sambar powder
Turmeric; to taste
Salt; to taste
Shredded dry coconut
-soaked in a little water
Mustard; (seasoning)
Urad dal; (seasoning)
Dry red chilli; (seasoning)
Curry leaves; (seasoning)
Oil; (seasoning)
Set dal to cook in about 2 cups water and a touch turmeric. When dal
is three-quarters done add shredded cabbage, potatoes and a little
more water if needed on top of the dal. Add sambar powder and salt.

Cover with a lid and let it simmer away another 10 to 15 minutes.
Veggies should be done but still holding their shape. Stir in wet
coconut. Remove from heat. Top with seasoning as explained in
previous recipes.

If more particular, grind fresh coconut with roasted red chilli and
roasted urad dal paste in lieu of the desiccated coconut.

Variations:

You can do a keerai (spinach) kootan with a little modification. Add
fresh coconut ground with roasted red chillies, urad dal and a little
cumin. Also you can cook toovar dal separately or throw veggies + dal
in a cooker for a few minutes, if you like. This tends to overcook
veggies but can be done fast.
