Title: Sticky Ribs
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Vinegar
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Salt
1 ts Paprika
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Catsup
1 ts Dry mustard
1/4 ts Black pepper
4 lb Beef ribs
Hint: When buying beef ribs, the bigger the-bone the better.

Combine all above ingrediants except ribs in a sauce pan. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat, simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off and set this
maranide aside for later.

Place ribs in single layer in baking pan. Cover with marinade and let
stand for 1 hour.

Drain off marinade, bake covered for 1 hour at 275 degrees, turning
and basting often.

Uncover and continue to bake at 325 degrees until very sticky.

This is a french fry and cole slaw type meal. Many people like wine
and beer, but go for the coke or pepsi on this meal. You will find
that an outstanding combination because of all the sweetness.
