1 c  Boneless chicken -- cut
Bite-sized pieces
1/2 c  Carrots -- julienned

1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves
1 tb Oil
1 tb Fish sauce
1 1/2 ts Sugar
4    Kaffir lime leaves
1 tb Red chilies -- sliced
Fry curry paste in oil over low heat for 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup thick
coconut milk and chicken. Increase temperature to med-high and cook
for about 5 mins or until the chicken is done. Add carrots and cook
until almost tender.   Add the peas, fish sauce, sugar and the rest
of the coconut milk. Stir and cover. Lower the temperature to
medium-low and cook until a thin layer of oil appear on the curry
surface. Turn off the heat and add Kaffir lime leaves, chilies and
basils and stir once or twice. Replace the cover until ready to
serve. Serve with cooked rice or boiled somen noodles. Makes
approximately 3 1/2 cups of curry.

NOTE:  Authentic Thai chicken curry does not include peas and carrots.
However, due to the lack of Thai vegetables in the U.S., the Thai
restaurant owners had to make some adjustments yet still maintain the
real Thai taste, That's where the peas and carrots come into the
picture. Enjoy!!  Happy (Thai) Cooking!! **:Gail in IL:** Formatted
