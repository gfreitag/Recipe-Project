Categories: Snacks, Breads, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
2 cn Canned biscuits
2 tb Ground cinnamon
2/3 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Pecans -- chopped fine
1/2 c  Margarine -- melted
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Dried apricots -- minced
1 tb Seedless raisins -- chopped

* Use your choice of canned biscuits, usually sold in cans of 8-10
biscuits or cans of 5 giant-sized.

1. In small bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar. Mix the chopped raisins,
minced apricots and chopped nuts in another bowl. Place the nut
mixture into the bottom of a lightly greased 10 or 12-inch oven-proof
dish or pan. 2. Cut each biscuit into 4 pieces; coat in the
sugar-cinnamon mixture. Place the coated biscuits atop the nut
mixture, fitting into the pan lightly. Keep stacking until all are
used. 3. Melt the margarine; add the brown sugar and orange zest.
Pour this very carefully and evenly over the biscuit pieces. Bake in
a preheated 375-degree oven for about 20 minutes, checking after 15
minutes. 4. Invert onto serving dish immediately. Serve warm.
