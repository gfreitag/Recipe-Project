FOR PASTRY CREAM: Stir sugar and flour together in heavy medium
saucepan. Gradually whisk in yolks and egg. Gradually whisk in milk.
Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into milk mixture; add bean. Stir over
medium-low heat until custard thickens and bods, about 7 minutes.
Pour into bowl. Remove vanilla bean. Press plastic wrap onto surface
of pastry cream. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

FOR DOUGH: In large bowl, stir sugar, butter, yolks, egg, lemon peel
and salt until well blended. Gradually stir in flour. Gather 2/3 of
dough into ball. Flatten into disk. Form remaining 1/3 of dough into
ball; flatten into disk. Wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate at
least 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 400'F. Butter bottom and sides of 9-inch diameter
spring- form pan. Roll out larger dough disk on floured surface to
13-inch round. Transfer to prepared pan, covering bottom and
overlapping sides. Fill with pastry cream. Brush crust edges with egg
glaze. Roll out remaining dough disk on generously floured surface to
12-inch round. Place atop pastry cream. Press edges of both crusts
together. Trim edges so that they are 1/2 inch lower than top of pan.
Fold edges over each other, forming 1- inch-high rim. With tines of
fork, press pastry rim against sides of pan to seal.

Bake pastry 25 minutes. Brush top with egg glaze. Continue baking
until crust is deep golden brown, about 20 nunutes. Transfer to rack
and cool completely. Release pan sides from pastry. Cut pastry into
wedges and serve.
