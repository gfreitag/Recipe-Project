MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1 ea Whole fish (1-1/2 to 2 lbs)*    1 1/2 t  Salt
2 ea Garlic cloves, roughly
-chopped
2 ea Whole scallions; shredded
2 T  Soy sauce
1 pn Sugar
1/2 t  Sesame oil
11 ea Piece ginger root, smashed
2 T  Fermented black beans
3 ea Sl Fresh ginger root;
-shredded
2 T  Chinese rice wine
1 1/2 T  Peanut oil
*Cleaned and scaled
PLACE THE FISH ON A PLATTER large enough to hold it, and sprinkle it
with salt. Squeeze the chunk of ginger in your hand to extract the
juice, letting it sprinkle over the fish. (The ginger must be fresh
and you must have strong hands to do this; as an alternative, use a
garlic press.) Chop the garlic and fermented black beans together.
Don't chop too fine or the mixture will become a paste and turn
bitter. Scatter the beans, garlic, shredded scallions and shredded
ginger over the fish. Mix the soy sauce, rice wine and sugar. Pour it
over the fish. If the plate is too long to fit in a bamboo steamer or
a wok, improvise a steamer. For example, a roasting pan could serve
the purpose, with a trivet standing in the middle to hold the plate.
Set the plate on the trivet. Pour boiling water into the pan, but not
enough to reach the plate. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and crimp
the edges to seal it. Put the pan over low heat to keep the water
simmering. A fish 1-inch thick at its widest point will take 10
minutes in the steamer. (The covered pan can also be placed in a 400F
oven to cook for the same length of time.) When the fish is done,
remove the plate from the steamer. A thin sauce will have formed on
the plate. Heat the peanut oil and sesame oil in a small saucepan
almost to the smoking point, and pour the mixture over the fish.
