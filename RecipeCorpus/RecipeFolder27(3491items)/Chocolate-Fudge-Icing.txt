This icing recipe is a candy recipe with milk added to make it into
frosting.

Bring to a boil in a large heavy pan: Bring t a boil and cook covered
2-3 minutes until the steam washes down from the sides of the pan any
crystals which may have formed. Uncover, redice heat and cook without
stirring to soft-ball stage, 238 degrees. When nearing 238, there is
a fine overall bubbling with, simultaneously, a coarser patter, as
though the fine bubbled areas were being pulled down for quilting
into the coarser ones. Remove from heat without jostling or stirring.
Cool the candy to 110. You may hasten this process by placing the hot
pan in a larger pan of cold water until the bottom of the pan has
cooled. Add: 2 4 TBSP butter Beat fudge partially.  Add: 1 tsp
vanilla Then beat until it begins to lose its sheen. At this point
the drip from the spoon, when you flip it over, holds its shape
against the bottom of the spoon. Quickly add: 1/2 1 c. broken nut
meats Pour the fudge into a buttered pan. Cut into squares before it
hardens. To use fudge for centers, beat until thick, knead and shape.

For chocolate fudge icing, the book says to:

Use in all: 1 c. milk Beat until the icing is of the right
consistency to be spread.
