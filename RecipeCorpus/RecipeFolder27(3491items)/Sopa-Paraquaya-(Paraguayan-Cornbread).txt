Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  With a pastry brush coat the
bottom and sides of an 8 1/2 or 9 inch square shallow baking dish
with 1 tablespoon of the soft butter, then scatter 1 tablespoon of
flour or grated parmesan over the bottom of the dish.  Tip the dish
from side to side to spread the flour or cheese evenly on the
buttered surfaces and set the dish aside.

Place the corn in the jar of an electric blender and blend at high
speed until it becomes a smooth puree.  (To puree the corn by hand,
force it through a food mill set over a bowl.  Discard any pulp left
in the mill.) In a large bowl, combine the pureed corn, cornmeal,
milk, 1/4 cup olive oil, grated Munster cheese and salt, and mix
thoroughly.

In a heavy 8 to 10 inch skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of
oil over moderate heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring
frequently, for 4 or 5 minutes, or until they are soft and
transparent but not brown. With a rubber spatula, scrape the onions
into the corn and cornmeal mixture. Beat the egg whites with a whisk
or a rotary or electric beater until they are firm enough to form
unwavering peaks on the beater when it is lifted out of the bowl.
Beat the egg yolks in a separate bowl until they are thick and lemon
colored, then fold them into the egg whites. Gently but thoroughly
fold the combined eggs into the corn mixture, then pour it into the
prepared baking dish.  Dot the top with the remaining 1 tablespoon of
soft butter.  Bake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes.
