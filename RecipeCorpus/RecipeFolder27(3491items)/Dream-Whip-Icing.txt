Title: Dream Whip Icing
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb White corn syrup (Karo)
2 pk Dream Whip mix (dry)
4 lb Powdered Sugar
2 c  White shortening (Crisco)
1/2 c  Water
1 tb White vanilla extract
1 tb Almond extract
Place crisco, water, corn syrup and extracts into large mixing bowl.
Beat on high speed until the water has emulsified with the shortening
and the mixture is fluffy.

Add dry dream whip topping mix.  Keep beating until it is thoroughly
mixed and the shortening/dream whip mixture is very soft and fluffy.

Add 2 lbs. powdered sugar to start with and keep mixing at a low
speed to start with or you will have "sugar dust" all over the
house!!! Add enough powdered sugar to get a good icing consistency.

If it gets too thick add a few drops of white corn syrup.  If it gets
a little to thin add more powdered sugar.  DO NOT ADD WATER!!!! You
will "melt" the frosting!

Want a color?  Use PASTE food colors for best results.  A little goes
a long way unless you want a "fire engine red" or black.

Want a different taste?  Use "Butter" flavored Crisco, or flavored
extracts to coordinate with your colors.  Just leave out the almond
extract in the initial batch.

This is a very soft icing to work with. I use it to ice wedding cakes
and other party cakes.  Gives good coverage and covers up mistakes
nicely. This is not a "sickly sweet" icing or "greasy" tasting icing
in spite of the ingredients.

To use in decorator bags just thicken it up with extra powdered sugar
and it will stand up to the test!
