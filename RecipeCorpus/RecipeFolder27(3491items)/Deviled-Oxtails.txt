Title: Deviled Oxtails
Categories: Beef, Herbs/spice, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Beef broth
1    Carrot
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Sour cream
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
2 c  Bread crumbs
4 lb Oxtails
1    Onion; quartered
1    Celery stalk
1    Bay leaf
1/4 c  Mustard, dijon
1/4 ts Cayenne
4 T  Margarine; melted
In a kettle, combine the oxtails, two cups water, the beef broth,
onion, carrot, celery, salt, and bay leaf; bring to a boil and
braise, covered, in a 350 F. oven for 2 1/2 hours.  Let the oxtails
cool in the liquid uncovered.  Transfer the oxtails with a slotted
spoon to paper towels and pat dry, and trim any excess fat.

In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, mustard, Worcester sauce,
cayenne, salt, and pepper.  Have the bread crumbs ready in a dredging
bowl. Spread sour cream mixture over the oxtails, coating them com-
pletely, and dredge in the bread crumbs.  Drizzle the margarine over
the oxtails arranged in one layer on a roasting pan and broil under a
preheated broiler about four inches from the heat, turning them, for
15 minutes or until golden brown and crusty.
