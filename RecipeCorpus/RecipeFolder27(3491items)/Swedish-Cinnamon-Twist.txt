1/2 c  Chopped nuts

2 T  Hot water
1 1/2 c  Sifted powdered sugar
1/2 T  Butter or margarine, melted
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.  Set aside.
Bring buttermilk to a boilin a small saucepan; buttermilk should
curdle. In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, baking soda and 1/2 cup
melted margarine. Add eggs.  When mixture is lukewarm, add dissolved
yeast mixture. Gradually stir in 4 cups hot roll mix until the soft
dough forms a ball. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough about 5
minutes until smooth and elastic. Add additional hot roll mix if
needed to make a soft but not too sticky dough. Lightly butter bowl.
Put dough in bowl and turn to butter top. Cover dough with a damp
towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1
hour.  Generously grease 2 baking sheets. Prepare cinnamon filling.
Punch down dough.  Roll out to a 12 x 20 rectangle. Brush dough with
3 tbsp melted butter or margarine. Sprinkle cinnamon filling
lengthwise over half of dough to within 1/2" of long edge. Fold
rectangle in half lengthwise to cover filling.  Seal dough edges with
the edge of a plate. With a pizza cutter, cut dough into 24 strips,
about 3/4" wide. Twist each strip twice and place strips 1" apart on
prepared baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk,
about 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 375. Bake 10 to 12 minutes,
until golden brown. Prepared glaze and brush on rolls while still
warm. Submitted By MEG ANTCZAK   On   02-06-95
