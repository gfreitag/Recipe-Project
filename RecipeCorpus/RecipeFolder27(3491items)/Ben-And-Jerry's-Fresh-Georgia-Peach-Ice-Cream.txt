Categories: Dessert, Ice cream
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------MARGE NEMATH GNFK05B-------------------------
2    Eggs
2 c  Whipping cream
1 c  Milk
2 c  Finely chopped ripe peaches
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1/2    Juice of lemon
Ben and Jerry prefer small peaches because they have more flavor and
less water than the larger ones. Combine the peaches, 1/2 cup of the
sugar, and the lemon juice in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2
hours, stirring the mixture every 30 minutes. Remove the peaches from
the refrigerator and drain the juice into another bowl. Return the
peaches to the refrigerator. Whisk the eggs in a mIxing bowl until
light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar,
a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended,
about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend.
Add the peach juice and blend. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream
maker and freeze following manufacturer's instructions. After the ice
cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before it is done) add the peaches,
then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready. Makes 1 generous
quart. Originally posted by Marge Nemeth GNFK05B
