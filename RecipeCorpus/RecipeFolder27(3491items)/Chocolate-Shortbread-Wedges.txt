Preparation Time: 0:47 1. Preheat oven to 325 F. In a medium bowl,
beat together butter, powdered sugar, cocoa, and salt with an
electric mixer on medium about 1 min, until well blended. Beat in
vanilla, flour, and orange zest until well blended. Mixture will be
slightly crumbly. 2. Turn dough into an ungreased 9-inch springform
pan. Pat evenly and firmly over bottom of pan, pressing bits of dough
together. Using a knife, score dough into 10 to 12 wedges, cutting
about 3/4 of the way through the dough. Press times of fork against
outside edges of dough to create a decorative rim. Prick dough all
over with fork. 3. Bake 30 to 32 mins, or until shortbread is set and
feels almost firm to touch. Shortbread should not brown. Let cool in
pan 5 to 10 mins, then cut through marked wedges. Let cool completely
before removing sides of pan. Note: Have made shortbread using pie
tins. Should work with this recipe also.
