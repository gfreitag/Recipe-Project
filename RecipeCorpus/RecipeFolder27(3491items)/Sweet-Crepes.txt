Title: Sweet Crepes
Categories: Cajun/creol
Yield: 24 servings
1 c  Milk
1 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1/2 c  Water
1 ts Vanilla extract
Unsalted butter or margarine
1 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1    Egg
1    Egg yolk
In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt with a fork. Make a
well in center of flour mixture; add egg and egg yolk. Using a fork,
slowly begin

to mix egg into flour. Continue until all flour has been moistened.
Add

milk slowly, stirring constantly to form a smooth batter. Stir in 1

tablespoon butter or margarine, water and vanilla until blended. The
batter should be the consistency of light cream. If it is too thick,
add 1 or 2

teaspoons more water; stir until blended. Cover and let batter stand
at

room temperature 30 minutes before using. To cook crepes, melt about 1

teaspoon butter or margarine in a 6-inch crepe pan over medium heat,
swirling to coat bottom and side. Pour 3 tablespoons batter into pan
all at once; swirl pan very quickly to cover bottom with batter. Cook
until bottoms of crepe is set and golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn
crepe; cook other side about 30 seconds. Cool crepes on paper towels.
Repeat with remaining batter. Separate crepes with small sheets of
wax paper, if desired. When serving crepes, fill so that first side
cooked will be on outside. Makes 24 (6-inch) crepes.
