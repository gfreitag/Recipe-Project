Title: Sprouted Mung Beans Cooked with Mustard Seeds
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/8 ts Ground cayenne pepper
-- (more as desired)
1 3/4 ts Salt (more as desired)
Freshly ground black pepper
-- (to taste)
3 tb Lemon juice
2 c  Whole mung beans
-- picked over and washed
4 tb Vegetable oil
2 ts Black mustard seeds
6 md Garlic cloves
-- peeled and minced
1/2 ts Ground turmeric
Soak beans in 7 cups of water.  Cover and leave for 12 hours.  Drain.
Cover beans with wet towel and leave in a dark place (like an oven)
for another 12 hours, until beans have begun to sprout.

Heat oil in a heavy saucepan over medium high heat.  When oil is very
hot, add mustard seeds and reduce heat to medium.  When seeds begin
to pop, add the minced garlic and stir until garlic is lightly
browned. Stir in turmeric, cayenne, and the sprouted beans, in that
order. Add salt and 1/3 cup water.  Bring to a boil, then cover
tightly and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until
beans are tender. Stir occasionally while cooking.  Add a tablespoon
of water if mixture becomes too dry.

Mix in the black pepper and lemon juice, to taste.  Adjust seasoning
as desired.  May be prepared ahead of time and reheated.
