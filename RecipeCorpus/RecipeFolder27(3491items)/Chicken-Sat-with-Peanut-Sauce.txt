Yield: 9 servings
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
Crushed dried chile peppers
----------------------------
6    Chicken breast halves,
ÿboned, skinned, and cut
ÿinto 1/2" wide strips
1 tb Light brown sugar
1 tb Curry powder
2 tb Crunchy peanut butter
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Freshly squeezed lime juice
2    Garlic cloves, minced
MMMMM------------------------PEANUT SAUCE-----------------------------
4    Garlic cloves, minced
1/4 c  Chicken broth
1/4 c  Heavy cream
Cayenne pepper
Grated lime zest
Fresh cilantro sprigs
2/3 c  Crunchy peanut butter
1 1/2 c  Coconut milk, unsweetened
1/4 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Molasses (or brown sugar)
1 ts Fresh ginger root, grated
To make the marinade, combine the first 7 ingredients in a shallow
dish. Thread the chicken strips onto bamboo skewers in a serpentine
fashion. Place the skewers into the soy sauce mixture and let
marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, although overnight is
preferable.

Make the peanut sauce by combining the next 7 ingredients (peanut
butter through garlic) in a saucepan.  Season to taste with cayenne
pepper.  Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the
sauce is as thick as heavy cream (about 15 minutes).  Transfer to a
food processor or blender and pure briefly.  Add chicken broth and
cream and blend until smooth. This mixture can be made several hours
ahead and stored in the refrigerator.  Bring to room temperature
before serving.

Prepare moderate-hot charcoal coals or preheat a broiler.

Cook the skewered chicken, turning several times and basting with the
marinade, until crispy on the outside but still moist on the inside,
about 8 minutes.  Sprinkle grilled chicken with lime zest and garnish
with cilantro leaves.  Serve with the peanut sauce for dipping.
