MY NOTES:
They don't mention whether the grits are the regular or Quick, but
cooking time would indicate Quick type.
1/2 teaspoon of salt is OK if you are watching your salt
intake...but grits cannot be salted after cooking and the taste can
be very bland with a low amount of salt added.
If using Quick grits...COOK ON LOW AND STIR OFTEN.
