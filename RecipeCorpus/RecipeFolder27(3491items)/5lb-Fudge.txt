Title: 5lb Fudge
Categories: Candy, Chocolate, Nuts/grains
Yield: 5 pounds
12 oz Chocolate chips
16 oz Hershey's chocolate bars
Nuts to taste
4 1/2 c  Sugar
1 x  Can condensed milk
1 1/2    Sticks butter
16 oz Marshmallow cream
Break up chocolate bars into a VERY large heatproof bowl.  Add
chocolate chips.  Mix in marshmallow cream.  Reserve.

In large pan place sugar, condensed milk, and 1 1/2 sticks of butter
(3/4 cup).  Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes.  Immediately pour
over reserved chocolate/marshmallow cream mixture.

Stir like crazy until blended (this is often a two person operation!)
Add nuts if you wish. (I prefer black walnuts, but too pricey unless
you have a tree or a friend nearby with one.  Otherwise good old
english walnuts have to do)

"Pour" (push) into a well buttered 1/2 sheet cake pan (12" x 18").

Makes about 5 lbs.
