Preparation Time: 0:30 1. Wash leaves and dry thoroughly with a
towel. Carefully melt chocolate in top of a double boiler or use a
small glass bowl in a microwave until melted and smooth. Using a
narrow metal spatula or a dull knife, spread a thick layer of
chocolate on underside of each leaf to within 1/16 inch of each. Do
not let chocolate go over edges of leaves. Place leaves, chocolate
side up, on a wax paper-lined plate or tray. Refrigerate until
chocolate is firm, 25 to 30 mins, or longer. 2. To remove chocolate
from leaf, grasp stem of leaf and gently peel off leaf to separate.
Touch chocolate as little as possible to avoid fingerprints and
smudging. Discard green leaves. Refrigerate or freeze chocolate
leaves in an airtight container until ready to use.

Note: Although chocolate leaves look difficult to make, they require a
little practice to turn out great leaves. Be sure to spread a thick
coating of chocolate on leaves. If the layer is too thin, the
chocolate leaves will crumble and break when you try to separate them.

NOTES : Leaves: use non-toxic stiff leaves with well-defined veins and
with 1/4 to 1/2 inch of stem attached.
Chocolate: Use any of the above. White should be imported. You
can
also use coating chocolate.
