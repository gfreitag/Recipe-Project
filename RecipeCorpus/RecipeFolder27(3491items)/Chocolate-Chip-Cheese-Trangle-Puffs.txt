Preparation Time: 1:05 1. To make filling, in a small bowl, mix
together cream cheese, 3 Tbs sugar, orange juice, and orange zest
until smooth and creamy. Stir in chocolate chips. Refrigerate or
freeze 15 mins to firm up mixture slightly. 2. With a rolling pin,
roll out each pastry sheet, 1 at a time, on a floured pastry cloth to
a 10 x 15-inch rectangle. Cut dough in half lengthwise. Then cut
crosswise at 5-inch intervals so you end up with 6 (5-inch) squares
from each pastry sheet. 3. Place 1 Tbs of cheese mixture in center of
each dough square. Moisten edges with some egg white and fold in half
diagonally to form a triangle. Press edges together firmly to seal.
Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush tops with more egg white
and sprinkle remaining 2 tsp sugar on top. Refrigerate 20 to30 mins.
4. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Bake triangles 15 to 17 mins, or until
golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature. Pastries can also be
prepared and baked ahead and recrisped in an oven a few mins just
before serving.
