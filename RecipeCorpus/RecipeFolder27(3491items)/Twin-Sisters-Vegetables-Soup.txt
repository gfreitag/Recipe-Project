Saute the onion, garlic, oregano, and pepper in a small amount of
water until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Dice the remaining vegetables, except the tomatoes, and place them
in a large pot; add the sauteed onion mixture. Add water just to
cover the vegetables.  Add the bay leaves, bring to a boil, and
reduce the heat. Simmer unti the vegetables are just tender, 10 to 15
minutes.
Place the tomatoes in a blender or food processor and process until
pureed.  Pour into a saucepan and gently boil for 20 minutes to
remove any acidic taste.  Add the tomatoes to the soup, along with
the cooked beans.
Cook for 30 minutes over low heat.  Refrigerate overnight to allow
the flavors to "marry."  Reheat and serve the next day.
