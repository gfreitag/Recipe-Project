Cut meat strips 1/2 inch thick by 1 inch wide.  String onto a piece
of wire or cored.  Dip into boiling brine solution (1 cup salt to 1
gallon water) until meat loses its red color. Remove meat from water
and let drip dry. Hang near a fire, but not so close as to cook the
meat. May be air dried or sun dried, but this takes much longer (days
or weeks), and the meat must be protected from insects.
