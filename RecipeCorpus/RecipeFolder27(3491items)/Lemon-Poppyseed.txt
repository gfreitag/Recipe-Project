Title: Lemon Poppyseed
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Bread
Yield: 12 servings
4    Eggs
Poppyseed
2/3 c  Vegetable oil
1    Box Yellow Cake mix*
1    Instant Lemon pudding
1 c  Water
*(I use Betty Crocker Supermoist) Beat all ingredients, except
poppyseed, until smooth.
Add poppyseed to your taste.  I usually add about 2 Tablespoons but
you can add as much as you like.  I then bake it in a well greased
bundt pan for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees or until a toothpick
comes out clean. If you were using small bread pans you would cut the
baking time down depending on the size of your pans. It makes great
muffins too.
