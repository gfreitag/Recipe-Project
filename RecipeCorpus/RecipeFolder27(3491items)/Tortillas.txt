Or, you could do what a
-friend of mine does, and
-pretend she intended
'em to look that way ++ she
-lets her kids play
-guessing games as to
What the tortilla looks
-like.  For some reason,
-the most popular shape
Well, the students in my
-cooking classes (most of
-'em, anyway) managed
To get decent ones after a
-couple of dozen tries.
-Are you rolling the
Dough into little balls,
-then letting it rest
-(covered with plastic
Wrap) for a half hour or so?

MMMMM--------------------SERIOUSLY, TRY THIS-------------------------
-time, from the plastic
-wrap.
4 ea Using your hand, squash the
-ball into a flat round
-cake.
5 ea Using a rolling pin or a
-dowel rod, begin rolling
-the tortilla from
1 ea Roll the dough into smooth
-balls the size of a golf
-ball.
2 ea Allow the dough to rest,
-covered with plastic wrap
-for about 30
Minutes.
3 ea Remove the balls, one at a
the center toward the outside.  Turn, and repeat, until you have a
round tortilla of the size/thickness desired. (This method is
identical to the way you roll pie crust, if that helps). Please note
these instructions are for flour tortillas ONLY.  I'm convinced that
the ability to hand-shape corn tortillas is genetic. Without a decent
tortilla press, a poor gringo(a) hasn't a chance.
