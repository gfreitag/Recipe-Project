Title: Primavera Fresh Herb Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
This sauce uses fresh herbs and lemon juice for a lighter flavor with
fish or chicken.  Try not to substitute dried herbs for the fresh;
the flavour simply won't be the same. If you're not practising the
art of green thumbery, you'll find fresh herbs in the vegetable
sections of the larger grocery stores, or at specialty food shops.
Ingredients: 2/3 cup lemon juice 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 Tbsp fresh
oregano, chopped 1 Tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt, and black pepper
Directions: 1/3 cup olive oil 1 Tbsp fresh basil, chopped

Combine lemon juice and olive oil until well blended. Add other
ingredients and mix well.  Let stand at room temperature to allow
flavours to develop. Makes 1 cup.
