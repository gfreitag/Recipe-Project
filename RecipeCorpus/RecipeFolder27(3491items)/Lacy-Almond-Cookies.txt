Preparation Time: 0:30 1. Preheat oven to 325 F. In medium saucepan,
combine butter, corn syrup, and brown sugar. Heat to boiling over
medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil 1 min. Remove from heat and
quickly stir in flour, almonds, and vanilla until well mixed. 2. Drop
mixture by teaspoonfuls at least 3 inches apart on ungreased
foil-lined cookie sheets. Bake 8 to 10 mins, or until golden. For
easiest removal from pans, let cookies cool thoroughly on foil on
pans. When cool, carefully peel foil from bottom of cookies. 3.
Spread melted chocolate on half of each cookie. front and back. Place
on wax paper-lined cookie sheets; refrigerate until chocolate is
firm. Wrap airtight and store in refrigerator.

Personal note: I can see one melting white chocolate and doing half
of the cookie in dark chocolate and the other half in white
chocolate. Should make for an interesting variation.
