Place the chicken, breast side down, in a Dutch oven or large
saucepan; add the onion, water, salt and pepper.  Heat to boiling;
reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 35 minutes or until the chicken is
tender. Let the chicken cool, remove the meat from the bones, and cut
it into bite-sized pieces. Skim off the fat from the broth and heat
the broth to boiling. Add the chicken, corn and broccoli. Reheat to
boiling. Meanwhile, mix the flour, milk and egg in a small bowl with
a fork. With your fingers, crumble small pieces of the dough mixture
into the simmering soup; reduce the heat to medium; cook uncovered,
for 5 minutes or until the drops of dough and vegetables are tender.
