In saucepan heat milk, cooking oil, and honey until very warm.

In a largebowl, blend 1 1/2 cups flour, yeast, salt, eggs and warm

remaining 1 3/4 cups flour and mix for about 2 more minutes until all
is blended. Dough will be soft and sticky.

Generously grease two 8 inch round cake pans. Stir down dough,
beating with dough hooks for 30 seconds. Drop dough tablespoon by

drizzle half of the mixture over the rolls. Cover, let rise again in
a warm place until doubled in size. Drizzle remaining topping over
rolls and bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until golden
brown. Immediately remove from pan and serve.
