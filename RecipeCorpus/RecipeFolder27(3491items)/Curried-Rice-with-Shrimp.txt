Title: Curried Rice with Shrimp
Categories: Seafood, Rice dishes
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Vegetable broth
1/4 c  Blanched slivered almonds
3/4 lb Medium shrimp
-peeled and deveined
1/4 c  Raisins
2 tb Canola oil
1/4 c  Onion; minced
1 c  Long-grain white rice
2 ts Curry powder
Salt and pepper
Preheat the oven to 375*F. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over
medium-high heat, add the onion and cook, stirring, until beginning to
soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice, curry powder, salt and pepper
and cook, stirring, until the rice is evenly coated with oil and the
curry smells fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly stir in the broth,
bring to a boil, cover and simmer the rice over low heat for 10
minutes. While the rice cooks, scatter the almonds in a pie pan and
toast in the heated oven until light brown, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking
the pan occasionally so the nuts toast evenly. Set aside.

Stir the shrimp into the partially cooked rice, cover and continue to
cook over low heat until the rice is tender and the shrimp are opaque
through, 8 to 10 minutes longer, stirring once or twice. Taste for
seasoning, transfer to individual plates and sprinkle with raisins
and the reserved toasted almonds.
