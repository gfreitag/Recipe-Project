brandy. Heat in microwave on High for 2 mins, until most of liquid is
absorbed; stir and set aside.

3. In a large bowl, beat together oil, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla
with an electric mixer on medium until well blended, 2 to 3 mins.

salt, and baking powder. Beat until well blended. Stir in zucchini,
walnuts, and reserved fruit mixture and its liquid.

5. Spoon batter into prepared pans. Bake 60 to 65 mins, or until a
cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Do not overbake.
Sprinkle remainder 1/2 cup brandy over warm cakes. Let cool in pans
on racks, then loosen sides of cake carefully with a sharp knife and
unmold. Wrap well in plastic wrap; then wrap in aluminum foil. Store
in refrigerator or freezer. Allow refrigerated cakes to age at least
1 to 2 weeks before serving.

freeze,
well wrapped, for holiday gifts and parties.
