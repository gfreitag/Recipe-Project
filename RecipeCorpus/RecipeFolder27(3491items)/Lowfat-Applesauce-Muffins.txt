Title: Lowfat Applesauce Muffins
Categories: Muffin, Low-cal/fat, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg
1/3 c  Skim milk
1 c  Applesauce
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Cinnamon
2 ts Baking powder
I've had mixed success with no-fat-added muffins. Usually, they are
not as light and come out brick-like.  But these were light, moist,
and lasted a couple days like that. Prepare the muffin pan using
lowfat cooking spray and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine the
flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix well.
Lightly beat the egg and mix in the milk.  Add the applesauce and
egg/milk to the flour mixture and mix until just moistened. Try to
avoid overstirring, as this may create "tunneling" in the finished
muffin.

Spoon the mixture into the muffin pans and bake for about 17 minutes.
Test for doneness with a toothpick: if the toothpick comes out moist,
then let cook for another minute or so. If dry, then muffins are done.

Good luck!
