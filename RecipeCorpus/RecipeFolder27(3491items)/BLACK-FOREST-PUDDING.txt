Title: BLACK FOREST PUDDING
Categories: Dessert
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM-----------------------PUDDING BATTER----------------------------
1 1/3 c  Ground almonds
1/3 c  Dry bread crumbs
1 lb Sour cherries
- rinsed, stemmed & pitted
6 oz Semisweet chocolate
3/4 c  Unsalted butter
2/3 c  Sugar
8    Eggs
1/4 c  Kirsch
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F and set a rack in the middle level. For the
batter, cut the chocolate finely and place in a small bowl over hot
water to melt, stirring occasionally. Beat the butter with half the
sugar until soft and light, beat in the chocolate, then the yolks,
one at a time. Beat in the kirsch. Combine the almonds and crumbs and
stir in. Fold in the cherries. Beat the egg whites until they hold a
very soft peak and beat in the remaining sugar in a slow stream. Beat
the whites until they hold a firm peak. Stir 1/4 of the whites into
the batter, then fold in the rest with a rubber spatula. Pour the
batter into a buttered and floured 2-quart gratin dish or other
baking dish. Bake the pudding about 30 minutes, or until it is well
puffed. Serve the pudding immediately, or allow it to cool slightly
and serve it warm or at room temperature.
