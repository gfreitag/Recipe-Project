In a heavy 8 to 10 inch skillet, heat the butter over moderate heat,
tipping the pan to coat the bottom evenly.  Drop in the onion slices
and cook them, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes, or until they are
soft and transparent but not brown.  Reduce the heat to low and
~-still stirring constantly-- pour in the egg.  The egg will
coagulate in seconds. Slowly stir in the manioc meal and cook,
stirring frequently, for 8 minutes, or until the meal, becomes
golden. Watch carefully for any sign of burning. Stir in the salt and
parsley. Serve hot or cooled to room temperature. The farofa may be
