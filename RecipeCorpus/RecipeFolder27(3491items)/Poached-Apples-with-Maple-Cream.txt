Title: Poached Apples with Maple Cream
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Light cream or
-half-and-half
-Pare and core apples.
4 lg Firm Apples
1 c  Maple syrup
1/2 c  Water
1 tb Butter
In a saucepan, combine the syrup and water. Bring to a boil and
simmer 3 minutes. Add the apples and cover. Simmer until the apples
are tender but not mushy, 3 to 8 minutes. With slotted spoon, lift
the apples onto individual dessert dihes or plates. Boil syrup until
reduced to 3/4 cup. Pour syrup into a measuring cup. melt butter in
the saucepan. Blend in the flour, cream and the syrup. Boil,
uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup, about 3 minutes. Serve warm, or at
room temperature. *NOTE- Because the apples are pared before cooking,
they will cook very quickly. Certain varieties might even get mushy
all of a sudden. Watch them VERY carefully while cooking; it just
takes minutes. This dessert is delicious and beatiful when you serve
one whole apple on a plate surrounded with the maple-and-cream sauce.
