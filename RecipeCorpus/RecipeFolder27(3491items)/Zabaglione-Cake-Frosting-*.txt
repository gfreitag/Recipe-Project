1/4 c  Unsalted butter; room temp
1/2 ts Vanilla

For frosting: Heat cream and sugar in heavy small saucepan until sugar
dissolves, swirling pan occasionally. Bring to boil, stirring
constantly. Reduce heat and simmer very gently until thick and
syrupy, adjusting heat so liquid is barely shaking, about 10 minutes.

with frosting. Refrigerate overnight. Bring to room temperature
before serving. Garnish with strawberries.
