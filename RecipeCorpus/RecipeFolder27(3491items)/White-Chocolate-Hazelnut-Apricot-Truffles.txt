Preparation Time: 0:34 1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Spread out hazelnuts
on a baking sheet. Bake 10 mins, or until nuts are light brown and
dark skins are cracked. Rub nuts in a terrycloth towel to remove as
much of skins as possible. In a food processor, finely chop
hazelnuts. 2. In a 1-qt glass measure, combine 12 oz white chocolate
and cream. Heat in microwave on Medium 3 to 4 mins, stirring twice,
until chocolate is melted and smooth. Stir in 3/4 cup hazelnuts and
apricots. 3. Refrigerate, covered, 1 to 2 hours, or until mixture is
firm enough to hold its shape. (If mixture gets too hard, let stand
at room temperature 1/2 hour or until still firm but soft enough to
shape.) 4. Using a 1 1/4-inch automatic-release ice cream-style
scoop, scrape up truffle mixture into 28 (1 1/4-inch) balls (or use 1
Tbs for each ball and roll between palms of hands into a smooth
ball). Place on waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate until
firm, 1 hour or longer. 5. In a small glass dish, place remaining 12
oz white chocolate. Heat in microwave on Medium 3 to 3 1/2 mins,
stirring often, until melted, smooth and warm. 6. Using a fork, dip
truffles quickly, one at a time, in chocolate, tapping fork on edge
of dish to remove any excess. Place on wax paper-lined baking sheet
and sprinkle tops with remaining hazelnuts. Store in an airtight
container in refrigerator up to 2 weeks or in freezer 1 month. Serve
in paper candy cups. NOTE: Truufles can be dipped in bittersweet
chocolate instead of white chocolate, if desired.
