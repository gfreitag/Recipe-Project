Shred the dried beef, removing any stringy portions; freshen, if

the dried milk with the 2 cups of cold water placed in a mixing bowl,
beating with a mixer until smooth.  Melt the butter in the upper part
of a double boiler, over direct heat.  Blend in the flour and pepper.
Add milk gradually and after the mixture thickens, place over hot
water and cook for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the dried egg and 2

with a mixer. Beat until smooth. Remove the sauce from the heat and
stir in the egg quickly. Add the dried beef. Serve on noodles or
toast.
