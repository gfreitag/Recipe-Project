Categories: Appetizer, Holiday, Greek, Vegetable
Yield: 50 servings
8 oz Cream cheese; cut in chunks
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 lb Feta cheese
20 oz Frozen chopped spinach
1 c  Butter; or margarine*
1 pk Phyllo pastry
2    Eggs; beaten
1    Onion; finely chopped
* To cut calories, you may use butter-flavored cooking spray in place
of the butter.
Cook spinach according to directions and drain well. Mix all
ingredients except butter and pastry. Refrigerate mixture at least 1
hour.
Open package of dough and cut a strip 2" wide, cutting through all
layers. Cover remaining dough with a damp cloth to keep from cracking.
Separate dough so that you have 2 sheets for each triangle. Brush the
dough with melted butter and put 1 rounded teaspoon spinach mixture
at the top of the strip. Fold pastry over like folding a flag. Place
on well-buttered baking sheet and brush top with butter. Bake at 375
deg. for 20 min. Serve warm.
To freeze the triangles before cooking, butter both sides of
triangle and wrap well. Bake when needed.
