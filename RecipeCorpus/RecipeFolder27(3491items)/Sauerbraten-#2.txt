Categories: Meat, Aust/german, Main dish
Yield: 1 recipe
1    Clove garlic
1    Onion, sliced
1    Orange, sliced
1    Lemon, sliced
1/2 c  Sherry
3 tb Flour
4 lb Or there abouts sirloin butt
1 c  Of your favorite red wine
1 ts Whole cloves
2    Bay leaves

1 tb Salt
Combine all the ingredients except the sherry and flour to make a
marinade and pour over the meat, allowing it to stand for about 36
hours at 40 to 50 degrees F.  Turn the meat over about every 12 hours
so it will become thoroughly saturated with the sauce.  Remove meat
and drain. Brown on all sides.  Strain the marinade sauce and add the
liquid to the browned meat. Simmer in covered roaster for 1 to 3
hours, depending on the tenderness. When the meat is tender, remove
from sauce, strain the gravy and thicken with flour.  Add your sherry
to the gravy. Serve with hot, buttered noodles or potato dumplings.
