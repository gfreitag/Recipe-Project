giving. Cranberries, fresh fruit, nuts and spices combine bright
color and a refreshing flavor for a holiday favorite. A nutty
streusel topping and a sweet hint of glaze complete the picture.

Preliminaries; Thaw frozen bread dough until pliable according to
package directions. Fifteen minutes prior to baking, preheat oven to
350 degrees.

orange peel, lemon juice and apple pie spice. Set aside. Prepare

lightly floured work surface roll out each piece of dough into a 8 by
7 inch rectangle. Cut the dough with kitchen shears to obtain the
correct measurement if needed. Place on baking sheet.

Make 2 inch long cuts at 1 inch intervals on both of the 7 inch sides
of dough rectangle. Spread 1 cup of cran-apple mixture lengthwise
down center third of dough. Top filling with 1/4 cup walnuts. Fold
strips diagonally over filling, overlapping strips to give a braided
look. Brush dough strips with a little milk and 1/4 cup streusel mix.
Repeat with remaining 2 pieces of dough.  Let rise for 30 minutes in
warm place. bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes,
covering with aluminum foil after 20 minutes to prevent
over-browning. Remove bread from baking sheet to cool. Bread may be
drizzled with glaze, if desired (recipe follows)

GLAZE; Mix 1/4 cup powdered sugar with 1 tsp milk; stir until blended.

STREUSEL  TOPPING   Procedure; In a medium bowl combine flour, sugars
