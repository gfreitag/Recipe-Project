Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------USE ON MEATS AND VEGETABLES---------------------
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 lb Butter
3    Large egg yolks
2 tb Lemon juice
Melt butter in a saucepan until bubbling hot.  Place egg yolks, lemon
juice, salt, and pepper in a blender jar or food processor bowl.
Cover and mix until just combined. Remove top and with machine
running, pour hot butter into machine in a slow, steady stream. Serve
sauce immediately or keep warm in a double boiler thermos bottle.
Don't let the sauce boil or it will curdle and separate.

Notes:  Hollandise sauce can be served with asparagus, broccoli,
cauliflower, leeks, or with artichokes as a dipping sauce. Add 2 tbs.
Dijon mustard with the egg yolks or 1 tbs. freshly snipped dill or
other herbs for heightened flavor.  If you should end up with a thin,
watery liquid, pour the liquid into a dry bowl. Then wash and
throughly dry the blender. Place an additional egg yolk in the
container and while the machine is running, pour the hollandise
mixture into the container in a slow, steady stream.  Process until
thickened.
