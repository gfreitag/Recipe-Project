This Enchiladas Fantasticas dish is not only feeds a crowd, it's
healthier than most enchiladas dishes because it uses ground turkey
instead of ground beef.  Also a nice touch - chopped spinach in the
filling, adding iron and other nutrients.  Let everyone customize
theirs with garnishes such as shredded lettuce, ripe olives, avocado
and sour cream (you can use low- or no-fat sour cream and save on
calories.)

In a non-stick skillet, cook turkey until it's no longer pink,
breaking into small pieces.  Add 1 cup picante sauce, spinach, 1-1/2
teaspoons cumin and salt.  Cook and stir 5 minutes until most of the
liquid is evaporated. Add cream cheese, stirring until just melted;
remove from heat. Spoon about 1/3 cup filling into center of each
tortilla; roll and place seam side down on lightly greased 13x9-inch
baking dish. Combine tomatoes, remaining picante sauce and cumin and
mix well. Spoon over enchiladas. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes
or until hot. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese; return to oven 2 minutes
to melt. Top with additional picante sauce.

*  You can make yogurt "cheese" at home for a low-fat cream cheese
substitute.  Buy a large tub of a good brand of unflavored yogurt that
contains natural curltures and NO gelatin.  Line a colander or wire
strainer with 2 layers of cheesecloth.  Dump the yogurt onto the
cheesecloth, place a bowl beneath and allow the "water" to drain off
overnight in the refrigerator.  The end result is a piquant spread
suitable for use where cream cheese normally is called for.
