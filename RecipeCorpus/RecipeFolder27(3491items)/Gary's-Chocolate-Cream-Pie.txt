-recipe)
1 pt Whipping Cream
Make a double batch of Gary's Chocolate Pudding increasing the
cornstarch to about 4 1/2 tb per batch (8-10 total).  Chill
thoroughly.  This pudding will be extremely thick.

Make or purchase your favorite pie shell.  I personally like the good
old fashioned, plain pie shell.  My family seems to prefer a cookie
type of shell.  If you make your own, you must pre-bake it as this
pie requires NO BAKING.

Whip cream with confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract until thick
and fluffy.  Take 1/2 of the whipped cream and add to the chocolate
pudding. Because the pudding is so thick, you will probably want to
use an electric mixer for this task.  Mix until all of the whipped
cream is thoroughly incorporated.

Fill pie shell with the pudding-whipped cream mixture.  Place
remaining whipped cream into a piping bag and pipe onto top of pie.
Shave bittersweet chocolate on top as garnish.

Cover pie and place into refrigerator for 2-3 hours to allow the
cornstarch that is in the confectioner's sugar to set.
