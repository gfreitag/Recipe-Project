Title: Pimiento Cheese Sandwiches
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 12 servings
1 ds Hot pepper sauce
Coarse ground black pepper t
Mayonnaise
24    Slices white or whole wheat
1 lb New York sharp cheese
4 oz Jar pimientos
Cayenne pepper to taste
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
Grate cheese on the small side of a hand grater in a large mixing
bowl. Drain the liquid from the pimientos and mash with a fork. Add
pimientos to the cheese in the bowl. Add cayenne, worcestershire
sauce, hot pepper sauce and black pepper to taste. Add enough
Mayonnaise (about 3 T.) to reach the desired consistency and mix
thoroughly. Use your hands or a big, wide fork to mix.  The mixture
will become firmer as it sets in the refrigerator. (You can trim the
edges of the bread at this point-I don't unless making them for
finger food.. Spread each slice of bread with mayonnaise on one side.
Put the cheese filling on 12 slices of bread, then put the other 12
mayonnaise coated bread slices on top. Slice the sandwiches
diagonally or into strips.  Be sure to put lots of filling into the
sandwiches.
