Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Butter or margarine, melted

2 1/4 c  Quick-cooking oats
1/2 c  Dark seedless raisins
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped nuts

Big, soft and delicious!

Preheat oven to 325ø.

In a bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In a
separate bowl, combine remaining ingredients. Stir to blend; add
sifted ingredients and beat until thoroughly mixed.

Lightly grease cookie sheets (or use non-stick cookie sheets). Drop
dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto cookie sheets about 2 inches
apart. Bake at 325ø 10-12 minutes or until edges are slightly brown.
Remove carefully and cool on wire racks. Store in airtight containers.

Variation: If children under 2 years old will be eating these, use
sunflower seeds instead of nuts.
