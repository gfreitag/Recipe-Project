Title: Buttercream
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Unsalted butter
- at room temperature
1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
3    Egg yolks
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Whipping cream
1/2 c  Milk
WHISK YOLKS AND SUGAR TOGETHER in a mixing bowl until smooth. Combine
cream, milk and vanilla in a pot, place over high heat. As soon as
mixture boils, remove from heat and slowly pour over the yolks,
stirring. Replace mixture in a pot, place over low heat and cook,
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. When the mixture has a
consistency that coats the spoon, remove from the heat and pour into
a bowl. Continue to stir as the mixture cools. Be very careful not to
overcook or the yolks will curdle. Cool to room temperature. Place
the butter and confectioners' sugar in a mixer and cream together.
Slowly add the cooled cream mixture until you have achieved a light,
creamy frosting consistency.
