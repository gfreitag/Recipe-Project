Title: Hemorrhaging Brain
Categories: Beverage, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
1 ds Grenadine
2    Shots strawberry schnapps
1/2    Shot Bailey's
Pour the schnapps into a lowball glass.  Then pour Bailey's right
into the middle and then the grenadine (it's just a dash of red color
to look like blood).  If poured correctly the Bailey's clumps
together in the bottom of the glass looking like (you guessed it!) a
brain (sort of). The grenadine is the "hemorrhage."
