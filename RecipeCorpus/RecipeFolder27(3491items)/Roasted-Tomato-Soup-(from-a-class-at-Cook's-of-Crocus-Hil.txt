occasionally.

remaining olive oil over moderately low heat, stirring until
softened. Add the roasted tomatoes, and simmer the mixture, stirring,

into a bowl. Return puree to the kettle. Stir in a pinch of baking
soda (keeps cream from curdling.) Stir in the heated cream, add salt
and pepper to taste and cover to keep warm.

In a food processor, puree the basil leaves with the remaining 1/4 cup
olive oil. season with salt and pepper. Garnish each bowl with a
drizzle of the basil puree.
