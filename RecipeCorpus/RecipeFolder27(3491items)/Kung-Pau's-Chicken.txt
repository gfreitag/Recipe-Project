Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Sugar
2 tb Peanut   oil;or corn oil
1/2 ts Salt
8    Sm Red chile,;dried, seeded
2 ts Ginger; fresh minced
2 c  Garlic; minced
1    Bell pepper; seeded, cut in
1 c  Peanuts
1 lb Chicken; breast, cut 1" pcs
Marinade; chicken:
2 ts Rice wine ;or dry sherry
1 ts Cornstarch
1 ts Sesame oil
1 1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
2 tb Red wine vinegar
ROAST THE PEANUTS IN A 325F oven until golden brown (about 10
minutes). Re- move and set aside. To make marinade, mix together rice
wine, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil. In a bowl, toss the
chicken with the marinade; set aside until ready to cook. In a small
bowl, mix well soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and other teaspoon of sesame
oil. Over medium heat, preheat wok until hot. Add oil, salt and dried
red chiles; cook until chiles are charred (about 15 seconds). Add
ginger and garlic; stir-fry until fragrant and lightly browned (about
30 seconds). Increase to high heat, add bell peppers and stir-fry for
30 seconds. Add the chicken into the wok and stir-fry a minute or
until the cubes feel firm to the touch and are opaque white in color.
It should take no more than a total of 2 minutes. Now stir in sauce
mixture; toss and stir until it thickens into a glaze (about 30
seconds). Remove wok from heat. Add reserved roasted peanuts, fold
together. Serve hot. Selden, here is my version of General Tso
Chicken, which is also known as Kung Pao Chicken. When charring the
chile peppers, be sure the ventilation is on and avoid breathing the
strong chile fumes. The charring creates a desirable smoky flavor.
Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes. GUEST CHEF (EXPT46B)
