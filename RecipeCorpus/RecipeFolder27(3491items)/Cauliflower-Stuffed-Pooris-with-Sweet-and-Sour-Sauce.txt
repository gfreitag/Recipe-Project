2    Serrano chilies; minced

Salt
1/2 ts Indian chili powder
1 c  Water (more as needed)
3 c  Atta (chapati flour)
1 tb Vegetable oil
3/4 ts Turmeric

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2    Serrano chilis; minced
3/4 ts Salt
Vegetable oil
-- (for deep-frying)
1/2 c  Raw peanuts
2 c  Finely grated cauliflower
3/4 c  Grated fresh coconut
2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
MMMMM-----------------------TAMARIND JUICE----------------------------
3/4 c  Hot water
1 ea Piece compressed tamarind
-- (2x2-inch)
For sauce: Simmer Tamarind Juice, jaggery and chilies in heavy small
saucepan until jaggery dissolves.

Heat oil in heavy small skillet over high heat.  Add mustard seeds and
quickly cover skillet.  When seeds stop popping, add fenugreek seeds
and cook until seeds turn red, about 1 minute.  Add to saucepan and
simmer until slightly syrupy, about 2 minutes.  Season with salt.
Cool completely. Can be prepared up to 3 weeks in advance and
refrigerated in airtight container.

For dough: Combine dry ingredients and oil in a large bowl.  Stir in
enough water to make a soft, pliable dough.  Turn out onto surface
dusted with atta and knead 5 minutes.  Divide into small rounds
(1-1/4 inch in diameter). Cover with plastic and let stand until
ready to use.

For filling: Roast peanuts in a small skillet over medium heat,
shaking or stirring frequently, until golden brown.  Using mallet,
pound peanuts until coarsely ground.  Place peanuts in a bowl and mix
in remaining filling ingredients.

To assemble: In a deep-fryer, heat oil to 400 F.  Flatten round of
dough, dusting lightly with atta, and roll into 3-1/2 to 4 inch
circle. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of circle and fold to
form a crescent. Seal edges well and fry each crescent in oil,
spooning hot oil over until poori begins to puff up, about 1 minute.
Turn poori over and continue to fry for 1 minute.  Remove and drain
on paper towels. Repeat for remaining pooris.

Tamarind Juice: Break tamarind into small pieces and cover with hot
water in a bowl.  Let soak for 30 minutes, mashing with the back of a
spoon. Strain through a sieve, pressing on solids to force out as
much juice as possible.
