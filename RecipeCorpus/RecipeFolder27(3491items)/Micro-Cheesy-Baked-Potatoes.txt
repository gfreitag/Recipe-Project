Milk 2 to 4 tablespoons
1/4 c  Shredded cheddar cheese
4 md Baking potatoes
3 oz Cream cheese with chives
1/4 ts Onion Salt

Scrub potatoes. Prick several times with a fork.  Arrange potatoes on
a microwave-safe plate.  Cook, uncovered, on High 14 to 17 minutes or
until tender, rearranging once.  Let stand 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
place cream cheese in a 1 quart microwave-safe casserole. Cook,
uncovered on high 15 to 30 seconds or until softened.  Stir in onion
salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Set aside. Cut a lengthwise slice
from the top of each baked potato.  Remove skin from the top slice
and put pulp into a medium mixing bowl.  Scoop pulp from each potato,
leaving 1/4 inch thick shells. Add pulp to mixing bowl. Set potato
shells aside. Add the cheese mixture to the potato pulp. Beat with an
electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, adding enough milk for
desired consistency.  Spoon one-fourth of the potato filling into
each potato shell.  Arrange stuffed potatoes on a microwave-safe
plate. Cook, uncovered, on High 3 to 5 minutes or until heated
through, giving the dish a half-turn once.  Sprinkle shredded cheese
on top.  Cook, uncovered on high 30 to 60 seconds more or until
cheese is melted.  You can stuff these potatoes ahead of time and
reheat them as needed.
