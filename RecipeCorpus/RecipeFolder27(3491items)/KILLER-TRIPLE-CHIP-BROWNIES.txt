Title: KILLER TRIPLE CHIP BROWNIES
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 32 servings
1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 c  Chopped walnuts
2 c  Semisweet chocolate
2 c  Milk chocolate
2 c  Butterscotch bits
Butter; to grease the foil
16 tb Unsalted butter; softened
2 c  Sugar
8 oz Bittersweet chocolate
- melted and slightly cooled
2 ts Vanilla extract
4    Eggs
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Line an 8 3/4-by-13 1/2-inch glass or metal pan
with a large piece of aluminum foil, smoothing it into the corners.
Butter the foil. In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar
together until it is light in color. Stir in the melted chocolate.
Add the vanilla, then add the eggs, beating until blended. In another
bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the walnuts and all the bits,
tossing to coat them with the flour. Scrape the flour, nuts and bits
into the bowl with the butter, and stir with a wooden spoon just
until all the ingredients are mixed. Do not over-beat. Scrape the
batter into the prepared pan, holding the foil so that it does not
move. Place the pan in the middle of the oven and bake until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out almost clean, about 50
minutes. Remove the pan and let it stand for an hour, then cover the
pan with foil and place it in your freezer for at least 1 1/2 hours
or in your refrigerator overnight. Turn the cooled brownies out onto
a clean workspace, lift off the foil and cut into 32 squares. Store
in the refrigerator or the freezer in an airtight tin.
