Categories: Indian, Vegetarian, Bread
Yield: 8 servings
2 ea Eggs, lightly beaten
3 pk Dry yeast (1 pack=10 oz)
3 c  White flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Poppy seed
1/2 c  Yogurt
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Sugar
4 tb Butter/oleo
Warm yogurt and stir in milk, until thoroughly mixed.  Remove from
heat.

Add baking soda, sugar, 2 tbs butter/oleo, eggs and dry yeast.

Sift together the flour and salt.  Make a well in the flour and
gradually add the yogurt mixture.

Knead the flour 15 to 20 mins until smooth and elastic.  Brush dough
with some of the remaining butter/oleo.  Cover with a warm, damp
cloth and set aside in a warm place for 3 hours until the dough had
risen to twice its size.

Dust hands with flour.  Knead the dough again for a few mins and
divide into 8 balls.  Roll each ball into a 10-in pancake.  Pull each
pancake gently to give it an oval shape.  Cover with damp cloth 20
mins.

Heat a griddle until very hot.  Mix the remaining 2 tbs butter/oleo
with poppy seed.  Brush one side of each nan with the mixture and the
other side with warm water.

Place the warm-water side on the griddle for 1/2 minute.  Remove from
the griddle and place nan under broiler for about 2 mins.  Serve with
curries and tandoori dishes.
