cake cool, then chill until cold,

at least 4 hours; serve or wrap airtight up to 2 days. Serves 12 to
16. COOKIE DOUGH: In a bowl, beat to blend 1/4 cup butter or
margarine, 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar, and 1/4 cup granulated
sugar. Stir in 2 tablespoons water and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat in
1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup semisweet chocolate baking chips
or chopped pieces.

TOPPING: Mix 1 c regular or light (reduced-fat) sour cream, 2
teaspoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.

COMMENTS: Soft, creamy lumps of chocolate chip cookie dough, made
without egg, are a tantalizing surprise in this smooth cheesecake.
Its a dessert that indulges those addicted to nibbling cookies before
they bake.
