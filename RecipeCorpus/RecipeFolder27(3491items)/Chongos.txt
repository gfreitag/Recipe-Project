Title: Chongos
Categories: Dessert, Tex/mexican
Yield: 12 servings
3/4 c  Sugar
3 T  Vanilla extract
8 c  Milk
4    Rennet tablets
3 T  Water
Heat the milk until it registers exactly 110 degrees F on a
thermometer. Crush the rennet tablets in the water and add to the
milk.  Let the mixture set for 1 hour, or until it has the
consistency of custard.  Cut into 12 squares.  Very carefully
transfer the squares to a cooking pan and add the liquid that may
have accumulated.  Do not add other liquid.  Add the sugar and
vanilla.  Let the squares simmer over very low heat, being careful
not to burn, for 6 hours, until the milk turns a golden color.

*Tip* A crock pot works perfect for cooking the squares over low heat
for 6 hours!
