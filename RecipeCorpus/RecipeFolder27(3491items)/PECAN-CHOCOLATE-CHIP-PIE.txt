FOR DOUGH: CREAM BUTTER, CREAM CHEESE and vanilla together in a mixer
or processor. Reduce speed to low and add the flour. Mix until just
incorporated. Remove the dough, form into three balls and wrap in
plastic wrap. Chill one hour before using. Uncooked dough can be
frozen up to two months. Freeze uncooked balls of dough or freeze
dough in pie tins. Makes three 10-inch pies.

FOR FILLING: MIX PECANS AND BUTTER in a small saucepan over medium
heat and cook until butter turns a golden color. Remove from heat and
set aside. In a mixing bowl combine eggs, corn syrup, molasses, brown
sugar and vanilla. Mix until smooth and then mix in the pecans and
butter. Pour this filling into the pie crust and sprinkle with the
chocolate chips. Place on the middle rack of a preheated 350F oven
and bake until the center of the pie is set, about 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let the pie cool before serving.
