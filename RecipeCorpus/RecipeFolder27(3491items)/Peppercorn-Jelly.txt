Title: Peppercorn Jelly
Categories: Fruit, Condiment
Yield: 1 batch
Water to cover
White sugar (3 lb maximum)
2 1/2 oz Tin green or black pepper
-corns; drained or not, as
-preferred
1    Wine glass cider or white
-wine vinegar
6 lb Cooking apples; skin, core
-pips and all; washed and
-cut in chunks
2    Lemons; cut in half
2    Wine glasses of white wine
-or cider vinegar
1    Fresh chilli pepper; chopped
-optional, for hotter taste
Put the apples, lemons, wine and optional chilli into a preserving
pan. Just cover with water and simmer until the fruit is a mushy
pulp. Strain through a jelly bag or double muslin, leaving it to drip
overnight. Don't squeeze the bag to speed it along as this will cause
the jelly to cloud.

The following day measure the liquid by pints (20 fl oz per pint)
into the pan.  Measure out the sugar, calculating 3/4 lb of sugar for
every pint of liquid.  (3 pints/60 fl oz is the maximum quantity that
is comfortable to handle.  If you want to make more jelly do 2
separate batches rather than double up on the amounts given here.)
Reserve the sugar.

Add the peppercorns and wine or cider vinegar to the liquid.  Heat
gently and when warm strain out the peppercorns and set them aside
for use later.

Pour the previously measured sugar into the liquid and stir over a
low heat until the sugar is *completely* dissolved.  Add a drop or
two more vinegar if the flavour seems too bland.  Then boil hard
until the jelly sets (when a few drops on a cold plate crinkle when
pushed with your finger). Remember to take the pan off the heat while
testing.

Remove any scum and stir in the reserved peppercorns.  Leave to cool
for about 15-20 minutes or until the jelly has begun to thicken and
the peppercorns float throughout the jelly when it is stirred.  (If
you are using the full 3 pints of liquid it may take up to half an
hour for the jelly to reach this stage but be patient:  if the jelly
is potted when it is still hot the peppercorns will rise to the top
of the jar as the jelly sets.)

Pour into warm, dry jars, cover with waxed discs and seal with
cellophane or screw-on lids.

Note:  the authors say this is great with all cold meats and also on
cream cheese and brown bread.
