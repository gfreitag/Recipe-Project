Title: Basic Creme Center
Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------MIX TOGETHER-----------------------------
1 c  Butter
2 1/2 lb Dry Candy Fondant
MMMMM----------------------------ADD---------------------------------
1/2 c  Whipping cream
Mix first 2 ingred. & let set overnight <or for several hours> tightly
covered. Add cream & whip with heavy duty mixer or by hand. Divide
dough into separate bowls. <I divide into 3>. Makes nice batch of
each. For each bowl, add whatever color/flavor, etc you like. Below
are some ideas: Vanilla cremes: add vanilla ****to taste. Chocolate
cremes: add melted dark chocolate to taste. Mint center: add drops of
peppermint oil & pink coloring. Black Walnut center: add drops black
walnut oil & bl walnuts. Peanutbutter cremes: add smooth or crunchy
peanut butter. Pineapple cremes: add drops pineapple oil, chopped
candied pineapple & chopped pecans. Jelly: add fruit "flavored" jelly
into candy mold with matching flavored oil w/creme center. Nut
center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as filling; dip in
white/tinted, or milk chocolate. Chocolate covered cherries <cream
type:> wrap creme center  mix around a well-drained marachino
cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill & dip in
choc.* Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge. The acid in
the cherry causes it to start cordialing <liquifying> quickly. Will
liquify some, but some will remain "creamy" because of the butter.
Coconut cremes: add maccaroon coconut & drops or coconut oil For any
dipped cremes: Form 1" balls, let crust over & dip in compound
coating chocolate. This is also called "dipping chocolate." I prefer
the brand "Merckens." It seems to take more abuse/ reheating, or
getting too hot, etc. Dolores McCann, Hamilton Ohio
