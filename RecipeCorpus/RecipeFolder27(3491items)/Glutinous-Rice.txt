Title: Glutinous Rice
Categories: Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Sugar
2    Fresh mangos (optional)
3 lb Glutinous rice
3 c  Coconut milk
1 tb Salt
Soak the rice overnight in cold water. Drain the rice and then STEAM
it for 20 minutes. While the rice is cooking, bring the other
ingredients to a boil in a suitable saucepan. Put the steamed rice in
a large bowl and pour the coconut milk mixture over it. Mix well. Let
it stand for a while so the rice can absorb the liquid. You may then
eat it as is, or, as we prefer, introduce large chunks of freshly
peeled mango fruit. This dish has been a hit everytime we serve it!!
