Don't dwell too long on the
-ingredients.
Now Haggis... that's
-another story... excellent
-stuff as long as you
Here's the recipe from the old (and I mean OLD) trusty recipe book.
Scottish National Dish...  To prepare it, procure the stomach of a
sheep and wash the bags in several waters, rubbing them well with
salt. Then scald them in boiling water, scrape them carefully with a
knife, and soak them in a strong brine for 12 hours, trimming off any
sinewy parts or pieces of gristle. Wash the lights, liver, and heart,
and hang them up to dry for 12 hours; then put them in a saucepan
with plenty of water and boil them gently. Take the small bag with
the windpipe attached, wash it free from the brine, put it into
another saucepan, with the pipe hanging outside the pan and plenty of
water, and boil it slowly for about two hours. Rub about a third of
the liver through a wire sieve, and chop rather coarsely the small
bag and 6 ounces mutton suet.  Mix these with the liver, adding 1
heaped breakfastcupful of Scotch oatmeal, season the mixture with
salt and pepper, and moisten with about 1 breakfastcupful of the
liquor in which the lights, etc were boiled.  Let the whole stand for
a half hour, then stuff it into the large bag and sew it up securely,
using strong thread. Put the haggis into a large saucepan of boiling
water, and place a plate underneath to prevent it sticking to the
pan. Boil it quickly for 1 1/2 hours, pricking the bag occasionally
with a skewer to prevent it from bursting, and add more boiling water
as needed. Serve the haggis on a hot dish as soon as it is taken out
of the pan together with mashed potatoes and bashed turnip.
Naturally... today we would use a plastic bag and perhaps take a
couple of other shortcuts... but that's the old original way of doing
it. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; August 13 1992.
