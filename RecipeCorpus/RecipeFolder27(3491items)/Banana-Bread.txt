Title: Banana Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit, Vegetarian, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 12 slices
1 1/2 c  Banana puree (3 small ripe
...bananas)
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Golden seedless raisins
2 c  Cake flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
3/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1    Egg, lightly beaten
CUTTING FAT WITH BANANAS: 1 cup oil = 1/3 cup banana puree + 1/3 cup
oil + 1/3 cup buttermilk (experiment and adjust amounts)

In this quick bread we've eliminated all oil by increasing the amount
of banana puree; buttermilk helps maintain tenderness.

1. Preheat oven to moderate 350ø.  Coat 8-1/2 x 4 x 3-inch loaf pan
with nonstick cooking spray.

2. Mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt in
medium-size bowl.

3. In a separate bowl, combine the egg, banana puree, buttermilk,
vanilla and raisins.

4. Gradually stir flour mixture into buttermilk mixture until smooth
and creamy.  Scrape batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly.

5. Bake in preheated 350ø oven for 45 minutes or until wooden pick
inserted in center comes out clean.  Transfer pan to wire rack to
cool for 15 minutes.  Remove loaf from pan to wire rack to cool
completely.
