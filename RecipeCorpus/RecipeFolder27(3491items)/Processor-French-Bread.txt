Title: Processor French Bread
Categories: Bread, French
Yield: 2 servings
-flour
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Warm water (105 F)
1/2 c  Warm water (105 F)
1 1/2 pk Active dry yeast
1 ts Sugar
3 1/2 c  All-purpose or unbleached
Makes 2 loaves

Flour

Generously grease baguette pans.

Combine 1/2 cup warm water with yeast and 1 tsp sugar in small bowl
and let stand until yeast is dissolved and mixture is foamy, about 5
minutes.

Combine flour, salt, remaining sugar and yeast mixture in work bowl
of food processor.  With machine running, slowly begin adding 1 cup
warm water. A soft ball should form in several seconds; if not, add a
little more warm water.  Let machine run 15 to 20 seconds, adding
more flour if dough seems too soft.

Transfer dough to lightly floured board and knead with a little
additional flour for several turns.  Divide dough in half and shape
into two cylinders 8 to 10 inches long.  Transfer to prepared pans
and cut 3 or 4 diagonal slashes in top of each loaf with tip of knife
or single-edged razor blade. Cover and let rise in warm place until
doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

After about 30 minutes, place racks in middle and lower quarters of
oven and begin preheating to 450 F.  Center shallow pan of water on
lower rack. When dough has doubled, place on middle rack directly
above water and bake 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 400 F and continue
baking an additional 15 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and
have a hollow sound when tapped with finger.
