-each cutlet used
Onion, chopped, 1/4 cup for
Break the bread up into pieces as for stuffing.  Add the chopped
celery and onion.  Add egg and salt and pepper.  Mix together and add
a little water if necessary to make a workable stuffing.  Roll out
the cutlets and press out to make as big as possible without breaking
them.  Place about a handful of stuffing on each cutlet and then roll
up and place in casserole dish.  After all cutlets are done, using
same bowl that the stuffing was in, add your beef boullioun granules
and water to make about 2 cups liquid. (more if making more cutlets)
Swish the beef broth around the bowl, making sure you get all the
leftover stuffing that might be left on the bowl, and then pour it
over top of the cutlets in the casserole dish. Cover and microwave on
high for about 20 minutes, slightly longer if doing more cutlets.  If
using the oven, bake at 350F for about 3/4 of an hour or more.
