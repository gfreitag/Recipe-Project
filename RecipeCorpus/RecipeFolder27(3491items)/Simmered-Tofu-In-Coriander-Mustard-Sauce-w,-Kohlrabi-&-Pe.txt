Categories: Vegetable, Fruit, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Dijon mustard
1 tb Ground coriander
16 oz Firm tofu, pressed and cut
...into 3/4-inch cubes
2 md Kohlrabi, peeled and cut
...into 1/2-inch cubes
...(about 1-1/2 cups)
1    Bosc pear, peeled, cored,
...and cut into 3/4-inch
...pieces (about 1 cup)
10 oz Fresh mushrooms
1/8 ts Thyme
Salt & ground black pepper
2 tb Canola oil
1 md Onion, finely chopped (1 c)
1 lg Shallot, finely minced
...(about 1-1/2 tb)
2    Heaping tablespoons flour
1 c  Hard cider or apple juice
...(see end note)
1. Clean mushrooms, trim stem ends, quarter them, and put in pan with
1 tablespoon water, plus thyme, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover
and simmer for 20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, in a large, deep saucepan, heat oil over medium heat;
add onion and shallot; and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions
are soft, about 5 minutes.  Add flour, stir to coat onions; cook 3 to
4 minutes, stirring constantly so flour does not color.

3. Stir in 1/4 cup of cider, scraping pot with wooden spoon to loosen
and dissolve flour; mixture will thicken.  Add remaining cider, stir
to make thickened sauce.

4. Mix mustard and coriander into sauce.  Add tofu and kohlrabi;
simmer gently, partially covered, over medium-low heat 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

5. Add pear and mushrooms; simmer until pears are tender, 10 to 15
minutes longer.  Adjust seasonings.  Serve over rice.

NOTE: Hard cider can be found in liquor stores.  It has a drier
flavor than apple juice.  Save what you don't pour into the pot to
drink; it's delicious served chilled.
