4 ea Iowa Pork Chops (1" thick)
Ground nutmeg
Ground ginger
Season chops with nutmeg and ginger; brown in melted fat.  Pour off
liquid. Place canned apricots halves (with skin on) upside down on
meat servings. Pour juice over all in skillet, sprinkle generously
with brown sugar. Cover and simmer 15-20 minutes until meat is done.
Syrup will burn easily if heat is too high. Remove meat servings with
fruit garnish to heated platter, spoon syrup over servings and
garnish with parsley, watercress or green pepper strips. NOTE: Cooked
carrots or sweet potatoes can be added to the syrup the last 10
minutes until glazed and heated through. Pineapple chunks or slices
may be substituted for apricots.

Thicken syrup with corn starch for gravy.
