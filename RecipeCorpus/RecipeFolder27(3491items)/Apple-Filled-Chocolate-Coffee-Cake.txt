Preparation Time: 1:40 1. Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar over warm
water in a glass measure; stir and set aside. 2. In a large bowl,
combine butter, milk, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa, salt, and eggs.
Beat with electric mixer on low speed. Add 3 cups flour and beat
well. Beat in yeast mixture until well mixed. If your mixer has a
dough hook, remove beater and attach dough hook; add remaining 2 to 2
1/2 cups flour to make a soft dough. Knead on medium-high speed 5 to
7 mins. If you do not have dough hook, remove dough to a lightly
floured surface and knead in remaing flour by hand. Continue kneading
about 10 mins, until dough is smooth and elastic. Place dough in a
greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1
hour. 3. Punch down dough. On a lightly floured pastry cloth or
board, roll out dough to a 14 x 20-inch rectangle. Spread with Apple
Filling to within 1 inch of edges. Starting from one long side, roll
up tightly jelly-roll fashion, piching seam and ends to seal. Place
in a lightly greased 10-inch tube pan and pinch ends together to
seal. Let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. 4. About 15 mins
before rising has been completed, preheat oven to 350째F. Bake 1 hour,
or until golden brown. Let cool in pan 10 mins, then invert onto a
wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
