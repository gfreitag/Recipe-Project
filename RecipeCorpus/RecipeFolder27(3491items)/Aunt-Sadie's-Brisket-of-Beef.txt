The following is my favorite brisket recipe and it really does come
from my Aunt Sadie's kitchen: Remove any excess fat from brisket, but
leave a little on top. Place one half of the onions on bottom of pan.
Season the onions with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and lots
of Hungarian paprika.  Place brisket on top of onions, then other
half of onions and allspice on top of the brisket. Cover and roast in
a 300 degree F. oven for 3 hours.
Test your brisket and when it is fork tender, take it out. Let it
cool and then slice it very thin.  Strain juice and either thicken it
with a little cornstarch or serve it au jus. You will have a very
dark brown juice. NOTE: Best when made one day in advance.  Aunt
Sadie almost always served this with savory noodle kugel. I also
serve it with roasted, boiled or mashed potatoes.  Use a good
roasting pan with a lit that fits well or covered with heavy duty
aluminum foil.
Spray pan and inside of lid with Pam.
