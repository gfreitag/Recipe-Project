rashers streaky (fatty) bacon
1/2 lb joint of leg of venison for roasting  2 1/2 lb fine sea salt
and freshly ground black pepper 12 shallots 12 225 g/8 oz mushrooms

1 cup 60 ml/4 tbsp cornflour
1/4 cup 125 ml/4 fl oz single (light)
(cornstarch)
cream 1/2 cup This German recipe is cooked in a Romertopf, a
casserole rather like a chicken brick which must be soaked before use
in the oven, but then steams and bakes the meat with very tender
results. Leg of hare can also be cooked this way, adjusting the
quantities accordingly. Soak the Romertopf in cold water for at least
15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 220-C/425-F/Mark 7. Line the
Romertopf with the bacon . Season the venison with salt and pepper
and place on top. Add the chopped shallots, sliced mushrooms, bay
leaf, juniper berries and red wine. Cover and cook in the oven for
about 2 1/2 hours. Take out the meat and keep warm. Pour the cooking
liquid into saucepan and thicken with the cornflour (cornstarch). Add
the cream with salt and pepper to taste and heat gently without
boiling. Serve the venison with the sauce.
