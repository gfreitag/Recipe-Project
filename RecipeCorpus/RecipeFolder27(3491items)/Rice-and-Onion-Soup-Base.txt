Title: Rice and Onion Soup Base
Categories: Soup/stew, Rice dishes, Vegetable
Yield: 2 quarts
1/2 c  White rice
Salt and pepper to taste
2 c  Onions; thinly sliced
2 tb Butter
8 c  Chicken stock
In a 3-quart heavy saucepan, cook the onions in the butter over
moderately low heat for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until
the onions are very tender and colored no more than a buttery yellow.
(This is known as "sweating the onions".) Pour in 4 cups of the
stock, stir in the rice and simmer for 20 minutes or more until the
rice is very tender. Puree the soup in the blender until very smooth
and lightly thickened, adding a little more stock if needed. Return
the puree to the pan, add the rest of the stock and season to taste
with salt and pepper.

Note: to make a fat-free version, cook the onions in a little stock
instead of butter.
