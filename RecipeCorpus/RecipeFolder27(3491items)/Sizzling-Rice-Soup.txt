Title: Sizzling Rice Soup
Categories: Vegetable, Chinese
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Light soy sauce
1 ts Cornstarch
1 ds Pepper
2 c  Hot cooked rice (short grain
1/4 lb Raw prawns
1/2 c  Frozen peas (defrosted)
4 c  Chicken stock
1 1/2 c  Oil
Press hot cooked rice into a thin layer (1/4" or less) on a cookie
sheet. Bake @ 350 F for 1 hour. Break rice into 3" squares. Shell,
devein and wash prawns; the dice and flavor with the
salt,sugar,soya,cornstarch, and pepper. Bring chicken stock to boil.
Add prawns and peas and return to boil. Heat oil to 325 F and
deep-fry rice for 5 min. or until golden brown. Drain. Pour soup in a
deep serving bowl and immediately put in the deep-fried rice while it
is still very hot. The soup and rice must be done at the same time or
there won't be any sizzle. For show, have your guests seated, the
bowl of rice on the table, then bring the hot rice and watch their
astonishment when you put the rice in. Alway good for laughs all
around. Enjoy. Dennis Eureka, CA
