Kohl Rabi, Turnip-Cabbage is a rather unusual looking vegetable,
belonging to the cabbage family, it is similar in size to a turnip.
It is a swollen stalk, not a root, with leaves growing out from the
surface. It can be white or purple skinned. Kohlrabi may be cooked
and served hot as a vegetable accompaniment, or it may be grated or
sliced very thinly and eaten raw.

To select: Choose small kohlrabi, no more than 2 inches in diameter,
as larger ones can be very tough. Do not buy any with decaying leaves.

To prepare: Trim base, cut off the leaves and stalks and peel the
globe thinly. Alternatively, the vegetable can be cooked and peeled
after cooking..

To cook:  Cook in boiling salted water for 20-30 minutes, steam for
30-40 minutes, braise or fry. Cooked sliced kohlrabi is also
delicious sauteed in melted butter for 5-10 minutes or until golden.

To serve:  Grated raw kohlrabi add sweetness to a winter salad. Cooked
kholrabi should be served hot with a knob of butter and a sprinkling
of parsley, or coated in a cheese sauce.

The kohlrabi originates in Europe. Its botanical name is
Brassica oleracea and is a member of the cabbage family.
However it looks like a turnip and has a distinctive
enlarged stem just above the soil. It is best harvested
for food when this enlargement is 2 - 2.5 inches in
diameter. At this stage the enlargement is globular to
slightly flattened, but if allowed to become old it becomes
elongated. The flesh resembles turnip, but is sweeter and
milder. The young tender greens maybe eaten as greens,
the thickened stem may be peeled and sliced and cooked in
the microwave or boiled till tender/crisp or however you
prefer your vegetables.
