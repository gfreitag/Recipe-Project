Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Place beef bones in a single layer in a large roasting pan. Roast for
1 hour, turning bones occasionally, and drain off some but not all of
the fat if there seems to be a lot. Add chopped vegetables and tomato
paste or pieces. Mix in with the bones so the vegetables are evenly
coated with fat, and roast for another 1/2 hour, or until beef and
vegatables are both well browned.

Place bones and vegetables into a large stock pot, draining off as
much of the remaining fat as possibe. Add remaining ingredients; stir
to combine. Cover with cold water.

Deglaze the roasting pan with 1 cup of water, scraping brown bits from
bottom of pan. Add to the stock pot.

Set the pot off to one side of the burner to make skimming easier.
Bring the stock to a boil and skim. Reduce the heat to a simmer,
loosely cover and continue cooking for about 4 hours. Skim
occasionally, and do not allow to boil.

Strain through a china cap or a colander lined with cheesecloth.
discard all bones, vegetables, etc.

Refrigerate stock. Remove any solidified fat from the stock before
using or freezing.
