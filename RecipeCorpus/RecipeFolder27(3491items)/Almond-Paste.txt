Categories: Dessert
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------MAKES ABOUT 6 CUPS--------------------------
1/2    Lemon; juice only
1    Egg; large
1/2 ts Vanilla; or rose water
6 oz Confectioners' sugar
6 oz Granulated sugar
12 oz Finely ground almonds
Sift the confectioners' sugar into a large bowl and add the granulated
sugar and almonds.  Lightly mix together, lemon juice, egg and
flavoring. Pour into the dry ingredients and mix to a fairly stiff
paste. (use a fork for mixing). Turn the mixture onto a board lightly
dusted with granulated sugar, and knead lightly by hand to a smooth
dough. Avoid overmixing.
If the paste is too sticky, work in a bit more granulated sugar, or
if too dry, add a little more lemon juice. Marzipan decorations:
Color the almond paste ( in small, egg-size pieces) with desired
colors. Knead until the color is evenly distributed. Roll out thinly
and cut into desired shapes. Molding Marzipan: If you are molding the
marzipan into shapes, use cornstarch on your hands to keep the
marzipan from sticking to them. Work as quickly as possible
