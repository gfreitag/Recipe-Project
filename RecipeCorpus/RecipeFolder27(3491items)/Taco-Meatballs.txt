Title: Taco Meatballs
Categories: Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Onion
1 c  Celery
2    Egg, beaten
8 oz Taco sauce
1 lb Beef, ground
1 c  Green pepper
1 c  Rice, cooked
2 ts Garlic salt
11 oz Cheddar cheese soup
Mix all but last two ingredients. (I puree vegetables in blender
rather than chopping.) Form meat balls and place in 2- 1/2 qt. dish.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. While baking, heat taco sauce and
soup on stove. Pour over meatballs and bake another 30 minutes.
