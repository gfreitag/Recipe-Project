Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 10 servings
1 ts Salt
2 ts Ginger
2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Cloves
1 ts Nutmeg
1 c  Melted solid Crisco
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Light or dark Karo
2 x  Large eggs
5 3/4 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
Makes 2-3 Medium-sized houses.

Pour melted Crisco into mixing bowl. Cool slightly; add sugar and
Karo, blending well. Add eggs, mixing all until smooth and creamy.
Put salt, baking soda and spices into mixture and begin to add flour,
just a little at a time. DON'T HURRY THIS STEP! Continue adding as
much flour as the dough will absorb. Bake house pieces at 375 degrees
for 5-8 minutes. Hints: Make permenant pattern pieces of mylar or
other plastic sheet. To roll out: Use heavy duty foil (splash a few
drops of water under it so it will stay stationary), roll the dough
out, cut into desired shapes that are 1" apart. Remove the excess
dough. Place the foil holding the pieces to bake on a cardboard,
place in oven and REMOVE THE CARDBOARD BEFORE SHUTTING OVEN DOOR. If
pieces bake together, cut apart immedietely after removing from oven.
Windows: Must be cut before baking. Can add crushed hard candy for
"glass" To Assemble" Use royal Icing: 1 1/2 c warm water, 12 Tbsps
Meringue powder, 4 pounds powdered sugar. Beat the water and
mer.powder til frothy. Add as much p. sugar as necassary. Do not make
icing stiff or house will not hold together as long. Using #5 tip,
squeeze out icing on both sides of back of house. Stand it up and add
sides. Prop with cans of soup, ect., if it doesn't stay firmly
together. Place icing on ends of standing sides and add house front.
Let dry for 10-15 minutes, then add roof and chimney. Decorate with
desired candies using royal icing to place decorations on. Let dry
and store covered away from dust. Source: an out-of-print book,
