2 c  Warm water

6    To 8 cups of flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Salt (level)
1 c  Shortening or butter (scant)
Mix sugar and butter and one beaten egg. 6 to 8 cups of flour.  Leave

of ice<box> for 1 1/2 hrs. before baking.

Valerie's Note: I guess she means the shortening when she says to mix
the butter... I guess you could use butter instead of shortening.  I
guess you would add the water with the flour....
