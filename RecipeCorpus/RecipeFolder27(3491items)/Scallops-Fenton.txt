Title: Scallops Fenton
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 servings
Dash fresh ground pepper
4 tb Flour
1 c  Diced Swiss cheese
1/2 c  Grated Romano cheese
1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
2 tb Butter for topping
Paprika
3 lb Scallops
1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
3/4 lb Mushrooms; sliced
1    Small green pepper; sliced
1/4 c  Butter
1/2 ts Salt
Bring wine and lemon juice to boil and add scallops, mushrooms, and
green pepper. Simmer just until scallops are tender. Be careful not to
overcook!!! Drain, reserving liquid. Melt butter in saucepan,
blending in salt, pepper, and flour until bubbly. Gradually stir in
reserved liquid and cook until thickened. Add Swiss cheese and 1/2 of
the Romano and stir over very low heat until blended. Remove from
heat and fold in whipped cream. Stir in scallop mixture, then divide
between eight, individual, buttered scallop shells/baking dishes.
Sprinkle tops with remaining Romano, dot with butter and sprinkle
with pap- rika. Broil until golden brown. Watch them carefully so as
not to burn!!!! This, as you may guess, is sinfully rich and
deliciously bad for you. Scallops themselves, however, are very low
in cholesterol. If you would also like to try some plainer, New
England-style scallop recipes, just let me know. Yours in good food
and good fellowship! FROM: DAVID SAWYER (RJHV41A)
