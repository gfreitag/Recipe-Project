In Italy, fennel is used as a complementary herb with pork ÄÄ
particularly with suckling pig and in marinades for wild boar.

Cured olives are flavored with feathery fennel fronds or pieces of cut
bulb.

The crisp stem and bulb is cut into salads or braised to serve with
game or other roasted meats.

The leaves can be stuffed into oily fish such as mackerel or cod.

When using only the bulbs, save the fronds for flavoring fish and
meats. Hang them up to dry, or dry them in the refrigerator or
freezer. Peel away or remove any bruised outer layers of the bulbs,
and trim the stems before using. The bulbs can be refrigerated for
several weeks, in the manner of most hardy root vegetables. Seal them
in plastic to preserve the moisture. Submitted By DIANE LAZARUS   On
