About 1" from one end of a hot dog, start a slit in the hot dog that
goes vertically to the other end. Turn a quarter turn and make
another slit. Keep making slits until you have eight "legs" for the
hot dog. Boil and the hot dog will look like an octopus.  Serve with
head up and legs spread out over an opened hot dog bun that has chili
on it.
