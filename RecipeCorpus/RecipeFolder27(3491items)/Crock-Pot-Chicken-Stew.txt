Title: Crock Pot Chicken Stew
Categories: Chicken, Soup/stew, Vegetable, Crockpot
Yield: 1 servings
-Seasoned pepper;to taste
1/4 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Basil
1/4 ts Oregano
1 cn Cream of chicken soup
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1    Frying chicken
3    Carrots; cut diagonally in
" chunks
3 md Idaho potatoes; chunked
2 lg Onions (I like vidalia's
-when in season)
Place half of veggies in the pot, add chicken. Mix pepper and spices
and sprinkle over meat. Add the rest of veggies and top with the
soup. Sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. Cover and cook on LOW 8 to
10 hours, or until meat is very tender and veggies are done. I put it
on in the morning and its ready whenever we are. The only bad part
about this recipe is that you have to take the meat off the bones.
Mine is usually cooked to the point where it falls off the bones but
you still have that mess. If desired, potatoes may be omitted and the
stew, when done, may be served with large macaroni cooked separately.
Leftovers can be refrigerated all in the same pot and reheated in
bowls in the microwave at 50% power.
