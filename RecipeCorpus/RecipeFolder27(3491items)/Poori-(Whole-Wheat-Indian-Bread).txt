Additional whole wheat flour Peanut oil or corn oil for deep frying

Combine 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and self-rising flour in medium
bowl. Mix in buttermilk.  Knead dough on lightly floured surface 2
minutes. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.

Divide dough into 8 pieces.  Roll 1 piece into smooth ball (keep
remainder covered with towel).  Dust generously with whole wheat
flour and roll into 5-inch-diameter circle, dusting with flour to
prevent sticking. Cover. Repeat with remaining dough.

Pour oil into wok or medium saucepan to depth of 3 inches.  Heat to
375 degrees.  Add 1 dough round to oil; dough will sink to bottom.
When dough starts to rise, gently press in center with back of
slotted spoon until bread puffs.  Turn and cook until light brown,
about 20 seconds. Transfer to paper towels uning slotted spoon. Keep
warm while cooking remaining dough.  Place on platter and serve
immediately.
