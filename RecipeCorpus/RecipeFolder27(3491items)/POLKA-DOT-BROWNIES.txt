3 oz Semisweet chocolate;
Coarsely chopped - OR -
3 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 c  Red-cal. margarine (tub)
4    Lg eggs (room temperature)
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
Preheat oven to 350. Lightly spray an 8" square baking pan with
nonstick cooking spray. In top of double boiler, over barely
simmering water (or in microwave), melt chocolate and margarine;
remove from heat and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool to room
temperature. In large bowl, with electric mixer at high speed, beat
eggs and sugar until pale yellow, thick and tripled in volume, about
7 minutes. Beat in vanilla and salt. By hand, stir in cooled
chocolate mixture, then fold in flour, just until incorporated. Pour
evenly into prepared pan and bake 20-25 minutes, just until a knife
inserted in center comes out almost clean. (If brownies are slightly
underbaked, they will have a fudgier texture.) Cool on rack before
cutting into 8 equal bars. If desired, dust brownies with either
confectioners' sugar or cocoa. Makes 8 servings of 1 brownie each.
Each serving provides: 1/2 protein exchange, 1/2 bread exchange, 1
1/2 fat exchange, 115 calories optional exchange. Per serving: 236
