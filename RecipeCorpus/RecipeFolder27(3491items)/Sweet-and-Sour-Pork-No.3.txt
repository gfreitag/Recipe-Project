and  salt.  Slowly add 1 cup of cold water, stirring with a fork
until the batter is smooth.  Stir in the peanut oil until thoroughly
combined. The batter should be the consistency of pancake batter. If
the batter is too thick, add up to 2 more tablespoons of water, 1
tablespoon at a time. Set aside. MAKE THE SAUCE: 2. In a large bowl,
combine all the sauce ingredients.  Set aside. 3. Preheat the oven to
250F. Heat a wok over high heat for 40 seconds. Add the peanut oil
and heat to between 350F and 375F. Meanwhile, in a shallow pan, dust
the pork cubes with the flour. Working with one-third of the pork at
a time, place the cubes in the batter, then use tongs to transfer
them to the hot oil.  Fry for 5 seconds, then turn over the pork
pieces.  Fry for a total of 3 minutes, turning several times, until
light brown.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a strainer
set over a large bowl to drain. Remove any bits of fried batter from
the oil with a skimmer or slotted spoon. Repeat with the remaining 2
batches of pork. 4. Skim the oil of all pieces of batter. Return the
oil to 350F to 375F.  Place all the pork cubes in the oil and fry
until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes longer.  Using a slotted
spoon, transfer the pork to a warm platter and place in the oven. 5.
Pour off all the oil from the wok and return the wok to high heat.
When a wisp of white smoke appears, stir in the garlic, then add the
scallions and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the bamboo shoots and red
pepper and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Stir the sauce to combine, pour
it into the wok and continue to stir.  Bring the liquid to a boil,
then turn off the heat.  Pour the sauce over the pork and serve
immediately.
