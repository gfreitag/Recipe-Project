Title: Grandma's Oatmeal Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Oats
1    Egg, extra large, lightly be
3 c  Bread flour
2 ts Yeast, sprinkled over flour
1 c  Water; boiling
2 1/2 tb Margarine
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Honey
1 tb Molasses, dark, unsulphured
Insert pan in BM and close lid. Select "Basic White Bread" setting and
medium baking degree setting. This is a very large loaf. On my
Hitachi, it hit the top of the lid while rising but it baked just
fine. I found, however, that I needed to use the "light" setting.
