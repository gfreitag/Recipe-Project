Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Cooking oil
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tb Roux (1 part cooking oil
To 2 parts flour)
2 tb Pumpkin seeds; pureed
2 tb Green chiles; minced
1/4 c  Parsley; chopped
2 c  Chicken stock
Toast pumpkin seeds until brown, or use pumpkin seeds called Pepitas
(This I'd prefer. I think you can get these at the spice rack in the
store). Grind, with the chiles and parsley, very fine. In a skillet,
with 1/4 C cooking oil, add a little of the chicken stock. Add the
green chile mixture and stir well, then add the remaining chicken
stock. Salt and pepper, to taste, and cook for a few minutes on
medium heat. Add roux, and stir, cooking until it thickens then
remove from fire. If not to be used immediately, then store in
'fridge. Heat only when you need to use it.
