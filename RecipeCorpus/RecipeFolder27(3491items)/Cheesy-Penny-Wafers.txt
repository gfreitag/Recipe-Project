Preparation Time: 1:05 1. In the bowl of a food processor, process the
cheese and butter for about 30 secs or just until combined. With the
machine running, slowly pour in the oil through the feed tube. Then
add the flour, mustard, and red pepper. Process for 30 secs or just
until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. (To keep the wafers flaky
and tender, avoid overprocessing.) Remove the dough, press into a
ball, roll in plastic wrap, and refrigerate 30 mins. 2. Preheat oven
to 350 F and set out 2 ungreased baking sheets. Shape the dough into
40 balls, 1/2 inch in diameter, and place them 2 inches apart on the
baking sheets. Using the back of a fork, lightly flatten each ball
twice, making a criss-cross pattern, until dough resembles a coin
about 1/8-inch thick. 3. Bake for 15 mins or just until crisp, but
not browned. Transfer to wire racks, dust lightly with paprika, and
let cool. Store in an air-tight container for up to 2 weeks or in the
freezer for up to 3 months. Makes about 40.

VARIATION: Vermont Cheddar Straws.

Make dough for Cheesy Penny wafers, using only 1/8 tsp ground red
pepper (cayenne). Chill for 30 mins, then roll out on a lightly
floured surface to 1/8 inch thick. Using a serrated pastry cutter or
a sharp knife, cut into thirty-six 3- x 1/2-inch sticks. Place on
ungeased baking sheets, dust lightly with grated Parmesan cheese if
you wish, and bake at 350 F for 15 mins or until crisp. Makes about
36.

NOTES : These flaky wafers are lower fat and cholesterol cousins to
the
traditional Pennies.
