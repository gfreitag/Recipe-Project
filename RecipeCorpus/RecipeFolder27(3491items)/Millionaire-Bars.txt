6 oz Chocolate chips
3/4 c  Chopped nuts
14 oz Caramels
1/3 c  Evaporated milk

Preheat oven to 350.  Lightly grease and flour a 13 x 9 pan. In medium
saucepan, combine caramels and 1/3 cup evaporated milk.  Cook over
low heat about 10 minutes, stirring constantly until caramels are
melted. Keep warm. In a medium bowl, combine quick mix, cocoa,

sprinkle with chocolate chips and nuts.  Top with remaining dough.
Bake 15 to 20 more minutes, until edges separate from pan. Cool
thoroughly. Cut into 2" squares.
