Title: Roumanian Eggplant Spread
Categories: Appetizer, Vegetable, Spread
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Minced onion
Sea salt to taste
1 lg Eggplant (about 1 1/2 lbs,)
2 tb Vegetable oil
1. Place whole eggplant over the open flame of a gas burner or a
charcoal
fire. When it is lightly charred on one side, turn it over and
continue
charring until it is mushy right through..

2. Make 3 vertical slashes in the skin and cut through from the stalk
to
the tip. Set the eggplant in a sloping position for about 15
minutes so
that the bitter brown juice seeps out.

3. Scrape the flesh from the charred skin and discard about 1/2 of the
seeds attached to the fleshy center of the eggplant. Discard the
skin.

4. Chop the flesh fine until it is almost reduced to a pulp-but-it
must
have texture and not be too smooth; stir in the rest of the
ingredients.

5. Set aside to season for about 1/2 hour and serve at room
temperature
with melba toast or matzos.
