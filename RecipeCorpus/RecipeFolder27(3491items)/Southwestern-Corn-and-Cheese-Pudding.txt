Title: Southwestern Corn and Cheese Pudding
Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Grated Monterey Jack or Ched
1 cn (4 oz) chopped green mild ch
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
6    Ears of corn or 10 1/2-oz fr
6    Egg yolks
3    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Half and half
HEAT THE OVEN TO 375F. Heavily butter a mold or souffle dish, and set
aside. Cook the corn, and, if using fresh corn, cut it from the cobs.
Chop the corn in a food processor fitted with the steel blade or in a
blender until it's pureed. Corn should still retain texture. Set
aside. Whisk the egg yolks, eggs and cream together, and then whisk
in the remaining ingredients. Scrape the mixture into the prepared
pan. Place the mold in a baking pan, and place in the oven. Pour
boiling water into the baking pan so it is half way up the sides of
the mold. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the
center comes out clean. Serve immediately. Serves 8.
