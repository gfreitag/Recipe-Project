In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat
for 30 seconds, tipping the pan to coat the bottom evenly.  Add the
onion and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes, or until it is
soft and transparent but not brown.  Pour in the rice and stir for 2
to 3 minutes, until all the grains are coated with oil.  Do not let
the rice brown. Add the stock, water, tomatoes and salt, and return
to a boil, still stirring.
Cover the pan and reduce the heat to its lowest point.  Simmer for 20
minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.  If the rice
must wait, drape the pan loosely with a towel and keep it warm in a
preheated 250 degree (F) oven.
