Title: Marian's Molasses Muffins
Categories: Muffin
Yield: 18 servings
2 T  Oil
2 c  Oat bran, not cereal
1 2/3 c  Whole wheat flour
2 1/2 t  Cinnamon
1/4 c  Fruit bits
3/8 c  Walnuts, chopped
2 1/2 t  Baking soda
Nonstick cooking spray
1 ea Egg
2 ea Egg whites
1 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Unsweetened applesauce
1/2 c  Molasses
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 ea Banana, ripe, mashed
Heat oven to 350.  Coat 18 regular muffin tins or 12 regular muffin
tins and 12 miniature muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray.  Set
aside. In the bowl of a food processor or blender combine whole egg,
egg white, buttermilk, applesauce, molasses, brown sugar, banana and
oil. Blend until banana is pureed and the mixture is smooth.  Set
aside. In a large bowl, combine the oat bran, whole wheat flour,
baking soda and cinnamon. Stir in dried fruit and walnuts.  Pour the
liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir to blend.  The
mixture will seem soupy, but will thicken as the dry ingredients
begin to absorb the liquid. Using 1/2 cup measuring cup, fill the
muffins tins three-quarters full. Smooth the top. Bake for 20 to 25
minutes, or until tops are brown. Cool muffins 10 to 15 minutes in
the tins, then remove them, place them on wire rack and allow them to
cool completely.  The muffins can be wrapped individually in plastic
wrap and refrigerated for one week or frozen for two to three weeks.
COOK'S NOTES: These muffins can also be made using egg substitutes in
place of the whole egg and egg whites. Use the equivalent of 2 eggs,
according to the instructions on the brand of egg substitutes. For
variation in flavor, substitute baby food apricots for applesauce and
minced dried apricots for the diced mixed dried fruit.  You can also
substitute chopped almonds for the chopped walnuts.
