Title: Gumbo Ya Ya*
Categories: Cajun/creol, Chicken
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Green pepper, coarsely
-chopped
6 c  Chicken broth
1 1/2 ts Fresh garlic, minced
1 lb Andouille sausage finely
-diced (or any spicy smoked
-sausage such as Kjelbasa
4 c  Fluffy rice
1 lg Roasting chicken (about 5
-lbs.), disjointed
Salt
Cayenne pepper
Powdered garlic
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Onions, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 c  Celery, coarsely chopped
Cut chicken breasts in half crosswise to get a total of 10 pieces of
chicken. Season with salt, cayenne pepper and garlic powder and let
stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Measure flour into a large
paper bag. Add chicken pieces and shake until well-coated. Remove
chicken and reserve the flour.

In a large skillet, brown chicken in very hot oil, remove and set
aside. Stir oil remaining in the skillet with a wire whisk to loosen
any brown particles remaining in the bottom of the pan. Whisk in 1
cup of the remaining flour and stir constantly until the mixture of
oil and flour (the roux) becomes dark brown (not black though).
Remove from heat and add onions, celery and green bell pepper,
stirring constantly so they do not burn.

Transfer roux and vegetables to a large heavy saucepan. Add stock to
roux and vegetables and bring ot a boil, stirring. Lower heat to a
quick simmer and add garlic, sausage and chicken. Continue cooking,
covered, until the chicken is tender, 1 3/4 to 2 hours. Adjust
seasonings and serve in pretty bowls over steamed white rice.
