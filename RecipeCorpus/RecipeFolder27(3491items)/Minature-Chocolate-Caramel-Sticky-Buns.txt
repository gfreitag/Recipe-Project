Preparation Time: 1:30 1. In a large bowl, combine yeast, granulated
sugar, cocoa, 1 1/2 cups flour, and salt; mix well. In a small
saucepan, heat milk and 3 Tbs butter to 125°F on a candy thermometer
or hot to the touch. Add milk mixture to yeast mixture and beat with
electric mixer on low speed until blended. Add egg and beat well. 2.
If your mixer has a dough hook, remove beater and attach dough hook;
add remaining 1/2 to 1 cup flour to make a fairly soft dough and
knead on medium-high speed 5 mins. If your mixer does not have a
dough hook, remove dough to lightly floured surface and knead in
remaining flour by hand; continue kneading dough until smooth and
elastic, 7 to 8 mins. Cover and let rest 20 mins. 3. Meanwhile,
prepare caramel for pans: In a medium saucepan, combine 4 Tbs butter,
1/2 cup brown sugar, pecans, and corn syrup. Cook over low heat,
stirring, until sugar and butter are completely melted. Do not boil.
Divide mixture evenly among 36 mini-muffin cups, 1 3/4 inches in
diameter. 4. Make chocolate chip filling: Melt remaining 3 Tbs
butter; let cool. In a medium bowl, combine melted butter, remaining
3/4 cup brown sugar, chocolate chips, and cinnamon; mix well. 5.
Punch dough down. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured board or
pastry cloth, roll each dough half into a 9 x 18-inch rectangle.
Spread each dough rectangle with half of chocolate chip filling to
within 1/2 inch of edges, pressing down slightly. Starting from one
long side, roll dough up jelly-roll fashion. Pinch seams and ends to
seal. Using a sharp knife, cut each roll into 18 pieces. Place rolls,
cut side up, on top of caramel mixture in mini-muffin cups. 6. Let
rise in a warm, draft-free place 60-70 mins, or until doubled. About
15 mins before rising time has been completed, preheat oven to 350°F.
Bake 20 to 25 mins. Immediately invert pans onto foil-lined baking
sheets. Let cool 15 mins. Serve warm or wrap in foil and serve at
room temperature.
