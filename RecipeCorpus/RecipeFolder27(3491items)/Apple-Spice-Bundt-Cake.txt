Title: Apple-Spice Bundt Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Fruit, Vegetarian, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 16 slices
16 oz Jar applesauce
2 tb Canola oil
1    Apple, peeled, cored and
-chopped
1/2 c  Golden seedless raisins
1/4 c  Walnuts
1 1/4 c  All-purpose unbleached flour
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
CUTTING FAT WITH APPLESAUCE:  1 cup oil = 1/2 cup applesace + 1/2 cup
oil [JANIE'S NOTE: I often use an equal amount of applesauce with good
results.]

When substituting applesauce for oil, begin with amounts indicated
above, then experiment, if you like, in future variations.  Here, we
increased applesauce to reduce amount of oil.

1. Preheat oven to 400ø.  Coat 6-cup Bundt pan with nonstick
vegetable-oil cooking spray.

2. Stir together the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking
soda, cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl until well combined.

3. In a separate bowl, beat together egg whites, brown sugar,
applesauce and oil.

4. Fold the egg mixture into the flour mixture along with the chopped
apple, raisins and walnuts until well combined.  Scrape the batter
into the prepared pan.

5. Bake in preheated 400ø oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a wooden
pick inserted in the center comes out clean.

6. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes.  Unmold the
cake onto the rack and cool.
