1. Lightly brush eggplant slices with oil and put them on a tray.
2. On a barbecue with lid, place grill 5-6" over a solid bed of hot
coals (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2-3 seconds). When
grill is hot, rub it lightly with a paper towel dipped in salad oil.
3. Lay eggplant slices close together on grill. Cover barbecue, open
drafts, and cook until slices are well browned and soft when pressed,
15-20 minutes; turn, as needed, with a wide spatula. Return slices to
the tray. If slices are cooked ahead, cover and chill up to a day.
4. In a bowl, cover cucumber and onion slices with ice water. Quickly
squeeze slices to briuse lightly, then cover and chill 30 minutes to 1
hour; drain. In bowl, mix cucumber, onion, vinegar, sugar, and 1/2
teaspoon salt. If made ahead, cover and chill up to 4 hours. Coarsely
chop eggplant and spoon onto a rimmed platter; top with cucumber and
onion mixture. Add salt to taste.
