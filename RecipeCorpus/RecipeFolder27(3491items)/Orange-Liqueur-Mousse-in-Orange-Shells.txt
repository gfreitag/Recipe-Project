Title: Orange Liqueur Mousse in Orange Shells
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
1 T  Sugar
6 l  Oranges
3    Eggs, separated
1 c  Heavy cream
1/3 c  Grand Marnier
Use a metal, preferably copper mixing bow with round bottom. Bring
enough water to simmer in a skillet or saucepan into which the bottom
of the mixing bowl will fit comfortably. Put the egg yolks into the
round bottom bowl and add the Grand Marnier. Beat briskly with wire
whisk to mix together thoroughly. Sit the round bottom bowl in the
simmering water and beat briskly and constantly about 5 minutes until
quite thick and pale yellow. Remove from the heat. Scrape the mixture
into a cold mixing bowl and put into freezer temporarily to chill. Do
not allow it to freeze. Meanwhile, slice the tops off the oranges,
and reserve one top slice. With a very sharp knife, cut around the
orange flesh in the shell to loosen it, then remove the flesh with a
spoon. Discard the membrane, white pith and seeds from the flesh of
two oranges (reserve remainig orange flesh for another use) and chop
the flesh. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Whip the cream until
stiff, adding the sugar towards the end. Beath the egg whites until
stiff. Remove the egg yolk custard from the freezer and fold int the
whipped cream. Add about 1/4 of the egg white and fold in with whisk,
then fold in the remaining whites with a rubber spatula. Fold in the
chopped orange flesh. Spoon the mousse into the 6 orange shells.
Place the filled shells on a baking sheet and chill in the freezer
until ready to serve. Meanwhile, thinly pare the colored rind from
the reserved orange peel slice. Cut the rind into fine shreds about 1
1/2 in long. Blanch the shreds in boiling water for 2-3 min. Drain
well. Garnish the mousses with shreds. Enjoy!
