Title: Mary's Honey Walnut Swirl
Categories: Nuts/grains, Bread, Breakfast
Yield: 2 loaves
4 T  Oil
1 t  Orange peel
1 t  Lemon peel
6 1/2 c  To 7 c hot roll mix
2 T  Active dry yeast
1 c  Lukewarm water
2    Eggs, beaten
1 c  Water
MMMMM-----------------------HONEY FILLING----------------------------
1/4 t  Salt
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
Powdered Sugar Glaze (see
Swedish Cinnamon Twists)
3/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Honey
1    Egg, beaten
1/2 t  Vanilla
1 t  Cinnamon
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1 cup lukewarm water.  When yeast
starts to bubble, add eggs, 1 cup water, oil, orange peel and lemon
peel. Blend well.  Add hot roll mix 1 cup at a time to make a soft
dough.  On a lightly floured surface, knead dough 5 to 7 minutes
until smooth and satiny. Lightly butter bowl.  Put dough in bowl and
turn to butter top. Cover with damp towel and place in warm place to
rise until dough is doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.   Punch down
dough.  Prepare honey filling. Preheat oven to 375.  Butter two 9"
loaf pans.  Divide dough into 2 balls. Roll out each ball to two 9 x
14 rectangles, about 1/2" thick.  Spread honey filling to within 1"
of edges.  Roll up like a jelly roll from small end, lifting dough
slightly and sealing edges as you roll.  Seal ends and put into
prepared pans, seam side down.  Cover and let rise in a warm place
until dough is slightly rounded above top of pan.  Bake 45 to 50
minutes, until deep golden brown.  Cool on wire rack.  While still
warm, drizzle powdered sugar glaze in top of loaves.
