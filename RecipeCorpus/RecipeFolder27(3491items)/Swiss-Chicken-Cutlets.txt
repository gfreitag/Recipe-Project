Cook's Tips

To prepare the chicken rolls, tightly roll up the cheese-toped
cutlets and then tie securely with string so the rolls hold their
shape during cooking.

If cutlets are unavailable at your local market, simply pound
skinless, boneless chicken breast halves between 2 sheets of waxed
paper to a 1/4-inch thickness.
