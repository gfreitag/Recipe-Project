BARTLETT, ANJOU AND BOSC ARE THE MOST COMMON PEARS IN SUPERMARKETS.
ALL MAKE GOOD-TASTING SAUCE, BUT BARTLETTS STAY THE WHITEST WHEN
COOKED.

Wash, peel, quarter and core pears just before cooking.  Place pear
quarters in a steamer basket in a pot filled with a small amount of
lightly boiling water.  Cover tightly (for better nutrient retention)
and cook for 8 to 12 minutes or until pears are tender, replenishing
water during steaming if necessary.  Test for doneness with a
toothpick or fork; pears should pierce easily.  Set pears aside to
cool.  Strain pears in a food mill or puree in a food processor
fitted with the steel blade. Discard the cooking liquid or save for
another use.  No additional liquid is needed.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Place prepared pear quarters in a microwave-safe
dish.  Add Â¬ cup water and cover tightly with plastic wrap, pulling
back one corner to vent.  Microwave on HIGH for 3 minutes, stir
thoroughly, re-cover, and cook for 3 to 6 minutes or until tender.
Check for doneness, cool, and proceed with recipe.

Makes 12 to 14 1-ounce or heaped tablespoon baby servings.

Freeze in heaped tablespoonfuls on waxed paper-lined cookie sheet;
transfer to plastic storage bags when frozen.
