Categories: Indian, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Tuna fillets, cut in 2"
-cubes
Parsley or Cilantro sprigs
-and lemon wedges to garnish
1/2 ts Saffron threads
1 tb Warm water
1 1/2 tb Ghee or butter
1 tb Garlic, minced
Combine saffron threads and water in a bowl and soak for 10 minutes.
Heat butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the garlic
until golden.

Drain off the butter into a large bowl,keeping the garlic bits in the
skillet. When the butter has cooled, add the saffron,and soaking
liquid and salt to taste.

Toss the fish in this mixture until each piece is well coated. Put
the fish in a baking pan lined with aluminum foil.

Bake until the fish is just opaque through, about 12 to 15 minutes at
350. Drain the juice from the baking pan into the skillet with the
garlic.

Turn on the broiler and broil the fish until the top is lightly
browned. Place the fish on a warm serving platter.

Reduce the sauce by placing the skillet containing the liquid and
garlic over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, stirring often.
When the liquid thickens slightly, pour it over the fish.

Sprinkle with lemon juice and garnish with cilantro/parsley and serve.
