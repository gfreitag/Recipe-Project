Title: Butter Horn Rolls
Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Melted shortening
1/4 c  Sugar
3    Eggs, well beaten
1 c  Milk, scalded
1    Cake compressed yeast
OR 1  cake dry yeast
1 1/4 ts Salt
4    To 4 1/2 cups flour
Soften yeast in lukewarm milk.  If compressed yeast is used allow to
stand 5 minutes.  If dry yeast is used allow to stand 30 minutes. Add
salt, shortening, sugar, and eggs.  Add flour, a little at a time,
beating thoroughly after each addition until the dough is just stiff
enough to knead on lightly floured board. Knead until smooth and
elastic. Cover with a damp cloth, set in a warm place, and allow to
rise until double in bulk. (The dough made with dry yeast will need
to rise overnight in a warm place.) Work down. Allow to rise the
second time. Turn onto lightly floured board.  Roll out in circular
shape.  Cut into sections as you would pie, having each section about
3 inches wide at the outer edge. Begin at the outside and roll each
section toward the center. Form into crescents. Place in well-oiled
baking pans. Cover and let rise until treble in bulk. Bake in hot
oven (450Ã¸ F) 12-15 minutes. 16 rolls. Mrs. K.R., Little Falls, MN.
