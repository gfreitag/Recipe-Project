1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking pan.

2. In a large bowl, beat together butter and brown sugar with an
electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, 1 to 2 mins.

3. In a food processor or blender, process lemon zest and granulated
sugar until lemon zest is very finely grated. Add to butter mixture
and beat until well blended. Beat in cocoa. Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.

4. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon,
cloves, and nutmeg. Add to chocolate mixture alternately with
buttermilk, beating just enough to combine. Fold in currants or
raisins. Turn batter into prepared pan. 5. Bake 35 to 40 mins, or
until a cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Serve warm,
with a dusting of powdered sugar.
