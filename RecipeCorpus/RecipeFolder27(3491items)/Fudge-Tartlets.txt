1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a 1-qt glass bowl, combine chocolate and
butter. Heat in a microwave on High 1 1/2 mins, or until melted and
smooth when stirred. Whisk in egg, rum extract, sugar, flour, and
salt until thoroughly blended. Stir in pecans; set aside.

2. Divide Cream Cheese Pastry into 24 equal portions. Press each dough
portion evenly in bottom and up sides of an ungreased 2- to 3-inch
fluted tartlet pan, preferbly with removable bottom. Divide pecan
mixture evenly among pastry-lined tartlet pans. Place pans 1 inch
apart on baking sheets.

3. Bake about 20 mins, or until set. Do not overbake. Let tartlets
cool in pans 3 to 4 mins; then use a sharp knife to loosen edges and
release tartlets from pans. Transfer to racks and let cool completely.
