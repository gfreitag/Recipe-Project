This legacy from my Hungarian grandmother links my children to their
Old World heritage in a most pleasing way! No one can eat only one of
these rich little crescents. Make sure you let the dough chill
overnight to make it easy to work with.

Editor's Note: You may want to cut recipe in half for a smaller
yield.

In a bowl, cut the butter and shortening into the flour until the
mixture is crumbly. In a separate bowl, mix the yeast into sour
cream, then add egg yolks and salt. Combine with the flour mixture.
Mix until smooth and the sides of the bowl are clean.

Form into a large ball and chill, covered, overnight.

To make filling, mix walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and stiffly
beaten egg whites together in a bowl. To make egg wash mix egg yolk
and few drops of water in a small bowl.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto a pastry board.
Divide the dough into six portions. Work with one portion at a time,
refrigerating the dough you are not using. Roll out the dough to
1/8-inch thick and sprinkle with more sugar. Cut into 2 x 2-inch
squares. Place a bit of the nut filling along one end of the square
and roll up. Form into a crescent. Place seam side down on a greased
cookie sheet. Paint with egg wash. Bake at 350ø for 15-20 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.
