control for light. Press start. Bread will be ready in 4 hours and 10

Studies indicate that oat bran is even more beneficial than healthful
wheat bran. So, we couldn't resist adding some to one of our whole
grain breads. Even better, a little bran goes a long way. Lots of
oatmeal plus crunchy barley make this bread a sure hit with the whole
family!
