Categories: Bread, French
Yield: 12 servings
1 tb Salt
Cornmeal
1    Egg white beaten with 1 Tbs
-water (glaze)
1    Envelope dry yeast
3 c  Warm water (105 F to 115 F)
8 c  (about) unbleached
-all-purpose flour
Soak a brick in water overnight, then drain it and put it in the oven
with the bread to create steam.  This gives the loaves a firm crust.

Makes 12 small loaves

Soak brick in water overnight.

Sprinkle yeast onto 1/4 cup warm water in bowl of electric meixer
fitted with a dough hook;  stir to dissolve.  Let stand 5 minutes.
Add remaining water, 4 cups flour and salt and beat until smooth.
Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until slightly sticky dough
forms. Mix until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Turn dough out
onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and no longer
sticky, adding more flour if necessary, about 3 minutes.  (Dough can
also be mixed and kneaded by hand.) Grease large bowl and add dough,
turning to coat surface. Cover with damp towel. Let rise at room
temperature 8 hours.

Punch dough down and knead on lightly floured surface until smooth,
about 2 minutes.  Return to greased bowl, turning to coat entire
surface. Cover with damp towel and let rise in warm draft-free area
until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Grease baking sheets and sprinkle with cornmeal.  Punchy dough down
and knead on lightly floured surface until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Divide into 12 pieces.  Pat each into 4x7-inch rectangle. Roll up
jelly roll fashion, starting at one long side. Pinch seams to seal.
Arrange seam side down on prepared sheets, spacing 3 inches apart.
Let rise until almost doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 475 F.  Remove brick from water and place in oven.
Make 3 diagonal slashes in loaves.  Brush with egg glaze. Bake 10
minutes. Reduce oven to 350 F and continue baking until loaves sound
hollow when tapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Cool on racks before
serving.

Bon Appetite
