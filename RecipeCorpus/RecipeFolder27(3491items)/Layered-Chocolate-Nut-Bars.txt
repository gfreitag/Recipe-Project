Preparation Time: 1:08 1. Preheat oven to 350 F. To make crust, in a
food processor, combine 1 stick butter, flour, 3 Tbs granulated
sugar, and baking powder; process until well blended. With machine
on, add cream through feed tube and process until dough clings
together in a stiff ball. Press dough evenly over bottom of an
ungreased 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Bake 10 mins. 2. Meanwhile, melt
remaining 5 1/3 Tbs butter. In a medium bowl, beat together eggs and
remaining 2/3 cup granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium
until light, about 2 mins. Beat in melted butter. Stir in nuts,
orange zest, and vanilla. Set nut topping aside. 3. Remove crust from
oven; leave oven on. Immediately sprinkle chocolate chips over crust.
Return pan to oven and bake 2 mins to melt chocolate. With a knife
spread chocolate evenly over crust. Carefully spread nut topping over
chocolate. 4. Return pan to oven. Bake 30 to 35 mins longer, or until
golden brown. Let cool in pan several hours or overnight. Carefully
cut cooled cookies into 40 (1 3/4 x 1 1/2-inch) bars. Sift powdered
sugar over top.
