Wash octopus, remove mouth and eyes. To a large pot filled with
water, add salt and bay leaves and bring to a boil. When water is
boiling, dip octopus in and out 3 times so that the skin will not
peel off. Cook octopus 45-60 minutes or until it feels soft when
poked with a fork. remove to a plate and cool, slice into 1/2" pieces.
To prepare sauce, saute pepper in oil until tender. Add onion and
cook until soft. Lower heat and let oil cool. Add paprika and water
at the same time to keep paprika from burning. Bring oil to a fine
boil, add salt and cayenne to taste.
Add octopus to sauce and simmer about 10-15 minutes. Serve hot with
rice or boiled diced potatoes.
