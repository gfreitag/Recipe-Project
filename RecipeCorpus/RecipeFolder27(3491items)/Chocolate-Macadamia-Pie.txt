1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, combine brown sugar and
flour. With a fork or wooden spoon (not an electric mixer), beat in
eggs, butter, milk, and vanilla. Stir in nuts, chocolate chips, and
coconut until well blended.

2. Turn into pie crust. Bake 30 to 35 mins, or just until barely set.
Let pie cool, then refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours.

NOTES : A cinch to prepare, but special enough for guests to rave
about.
Serve topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for added
treat.
