Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 servings
1    Cake compressed yeast
OR 1  cake dry yeast
2 tb Melted shortening
White flour
6 c  Milk
4 tb Sugar
3 ts Salt
6 c  Whole wheat or graham flour
Heat milk until lukewarm; add yeast.  IF compressed yeast is used
allow to stand 5 minutes; if dry yeast is used allow to stand 30
minutes. Add sugar, salt, and shortening.  Add unsifted whole wheat
flour, a little at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition.
Add sufficient sifted white flour to make dough just stiff enough to
knead. Turn onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
elastic. Cover with a damp cloth, set in a warm place, and allow
dough to rise until double in bulk.  (If dry yeast is used allow
dough to rise overnight in a warm place.) Work down and form into 3
loaves.  Place in well-oiled bread pans. Cover and let rise until
double in bulk.  Bake in hot oven (425Ã¸ F) about 45 minutes. 3 small
loaves. Mrs. Ralph Chapman, Stonington, IL.
