Categories: Tex/mexican, Condiment, Hot/spicy, Salsa/sauce, Chilies
Yield: 2 cups
-With 3 to 4 Inches of Green
Salt
Lime Juice
1 lb Tomatillos
3    Or 4 Habanero Chiles
2    Oranges
1 bn Green Onions, Sliced Fine
In an ungreased skillet over medium heat, roast half of the
tomatillos in their husks for about 10 minutes, turning frequently.
Meanwhile, husk the remaining tomatillos, dice fine, and place them
in a bowl. Cool the roasted tomatillos, then husk them and place them
in a blender.

Roast the Habaneros over low heat, turning occasionally, about 5
minutes, or until they are just soft and speckled with brown. Wearing
rubber gloves, stem and seed the Habaneros and add them to the
tomatillos in the blender. Puree the mixture.

Squeeze one of the oranges and pour the juice into the bowl
containing the diced tomatillos.  Add the pureed chiles and
tomatillos. Peel the other orange, removing the pith; seed if
necessary and cut into small dice. Add the diced orange and the green
onions to the salsa.

Season the salsa with salt and lime juice, and let stand for about
half an hour before serving.
