Categories: Salad, Vegetable, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 lb Fresh asparagus; trimmed
1 tb Olive oil
2 ts Seasoned dry bread crumbs
4    Slices low-fat turkey ham
8    Lemon slices; for garnish
4    Boneless chicken breasts
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ts Salt; optional
1/2 ts Pepper; fresh ground
1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
In med. bowl, combine chicken, lemon juice, 1/2 of the salt, pepper
and lemon zest. Toss to mix. On a large flat plate, coat the chicken
with the seasoned bread crumbs. Spray Pam on a non-stick skillet and
heat over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning once,

juicy--about 5-7 minutes). Place chicken on a serving platter.
Meanwhile, steam the fresh asparagus for approx. 5-7 minutes. When
done, season the asparagus with the remaining lemon zest and salt and
pepper. Divide asparagus into 4 bundles. Wrap each asparagus bundle
with a slice of the turkey "ham" and place on top of chicken. Garnish
with lemon slices. Judy Garnett,pjxg05a Raleigh,NC Adapted from
