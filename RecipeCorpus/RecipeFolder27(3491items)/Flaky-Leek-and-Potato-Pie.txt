Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegetable, Pie/tart
Yield: 4 servings
Freshly ground nutmeg
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
1/2 lb Frozen puff pastry
Beaten egg to glaze
-optional
3 lg Potatoes, thinly sliced
4 md Trimmed leeks, sliced
2 tb Butter
1 lg Onion, finely chopped
2 tb Chopped fresh chives
1/4 c  Creme fraiche
Cook the potatoes in boiling water until just tender: 8 - 10 minutes.
In another pan cook the leeks in boiling water until just tender: 8 -
10 minutes.  Drain.

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat, add the onion,
cover, and cook until tender: about 10 minutes.

Remove the onion from the heat and add the potatoes, leeks, herbs and
creme fraiche.  Mix well, season with nutmeg, salt and black pepper,
and leave to cool.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. (200 C.)

Take a 10 inch pie pan.  Role out the pastry so that it is larger all
around thaan the pie pan.  Cut around the pie pan to make the top
crust, and then cut around this, 1 inch from the pan, to make the pie
rim. Set these and any trimmings aside.

Spoon the filling into the pie pan.  It should fill it generously and
form a rounded dome.

Fit the pastry rim on the edge of the pie pan, pleating it if
necessary, brush with cold water, and position the top crust on top
to cover the whole pan.  Press the edges firmly together to seal the
pie, then flute and scallop the pie rim.  Make a steam hole in the
center. Decoreate the pie with pastry trimmings, sticking them on
with cold water, then brush with beaten egg if desired.

Bake until purred up and golden brown:  35-40 minutes.  Serve at once.
