Title: Crepes Suzette
Categories: Dessert
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
1/3 c  Sweet wine
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Sugar
3    Eggs; separated
Palacsinta: Beat egg whites until stiff. Add egg yolks, sugar, and
salt. Beat until dough is not gritty from sugar. Add vanilla and
flour by spoonfuls along with wine and milk. Beat until smooth, to a
thin batter. Heat frying pan. Brush lightly with shortening and pour
in enough batter to cover pan with very thin layer. (Tilt pan so
batter spreads evenly, like pancakes). Brown on one side. Turn and
brown other side. Use favorite filling. (Try cottage cheese and black
raspberry. preserves. Very good.) We spread the filling (which ever
one you choose) on the palascinta and then roll up and dust it with
powder sugar (if desired). Do not put too much filling because as you
eat it, it might drip out. Enjoy, you will like it. 01/07 09:37 am
