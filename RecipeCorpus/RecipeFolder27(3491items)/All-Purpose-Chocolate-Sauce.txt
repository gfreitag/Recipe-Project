In a small saucepan, combine powdered sugar, cream, butter, cocoa, and
chocolate. Place over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until
chocolate melts and sauce is smooth and glossy, 3 to 5 mins. Remove
from heat and stir in amaretto and chocolate liqueur. Let cool to room
temperature.

non-alcoholic, leave out the liqueur and substitute 1/4 cup of
strong coffee.
