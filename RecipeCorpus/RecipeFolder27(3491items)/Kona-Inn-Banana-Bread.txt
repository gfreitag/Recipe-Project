Title: Kona Inn Banana Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Baking Soda
1 ts Salt
2 c  All purpose Flour
1/2 c  Macadamia Nuts chopped
1 c  Butter
2 c  Granulated Sugar
4    Eggs; beaten
6    Ripe Bananas; mashed
In a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a light lemon
color. Then add the squashed bananas and the beaten eggs. Stir well
until all ingredients are completely mixed. Sift the flour, the salt
and the baking soda into the creamed mixture then add the chopped
nuts. Again mix until blended but make sure you do not mix the batter
too much. Pre heat the oven to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to
temperature pour the batter into two prepared loaf pans and bake for
45 minutes. Before my wife died she often watched while I was making
a mess in her kitchen doing my imitation of a bakery chef. She said
that the Kona Inn Banana Bread should be renamed Garbage bread
because I never stuck to the recipe and added all sorts of thing that
I found such as any kind of chopped nuts, lemon and orange zest,
chopped apricots, chopped mango, coconut flakes and one time I even
added some mincemeat that was left over after baking some mince pies.
Perhaps the Kona Inn should have taken me to court and forced me to
stop making changes to their Banana Bread. Perhaps my use of their
name for the resulting strange flavored versions of their Banana
bread had something to do with their going out of business some years
ago.
