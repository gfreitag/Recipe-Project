Preparation Time: 0:50 1. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a food processor,
combine chocolate, apricots, raisins, almonds, and rum. Process until
mixture is chopped into very small pieces. 2. Unwrap filo dough
sheets and place on a large sheet of wax paper. Cover with wax paper
and a damp towel. Remove 1 filo sheet to another sheet of wax paper;
brush with some clarified butter. Top with a second filo sheet. Cut
lengthwise into 4 equal strips. 3. Place about 1 tsp chocolate-fruit
filling in bottom corner of each strip. Fold 1 corner of dough over
filling to opposite side to make a triangle. Continue folding strip
as in a flag fold, keeping triangle shape until all dough is folded.
Place seam side down on ungreased baking sheets. Repeat with
remaining filo, more clarified butter, and remaining filling. Brush
tops with more butter. Bake 20 mins, or until golden brown. Serve
warm or at room temperature.

NOTE: To clarify butter, in a small skillet melt butter over low
heat. Let stand a few mins. Skim off and discard white foam that
rises to top and do not use any milky residue that sinks to the
bottom of the skillet. The clear yellow liquid is clarified butter.
