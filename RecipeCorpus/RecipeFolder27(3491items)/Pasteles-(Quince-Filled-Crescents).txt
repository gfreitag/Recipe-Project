Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  In a large bowl, combine the
flour, baking powder and salt.  Add the butter and, working quickly,
use your fingertips to rub the flour and fat together until they look
like flakes of coarse meal.  Add the water, a few teaspoonfuls at a
time, and press and knead gently with your fingers until the dough
can be gathered into a compact ball.  If the dough seems crumbly,
moisten it with a little more water to make the particles adhere.
On a floured surface roll out the dough into a large circle about
1/8 inch thick.  With a 4 inch round cookie cutter (or a pot lid or
plate and a pastry wheel), cut the dough into as many rounds as you
can. Then gather the scraps into a small ball, reroll, and cut into
similar rounds, continuing the process until all the dough has been
used.
Place 1 tablespoon of quince paste in the center of each round.
Moisten the edges of the round with a finger dipped in water, fold
the dough in half and press the edges firmly shut with your fingers.
Then seal them further by pressing the outside edges with the tines
of a table fork. Place the cookies on one or two lightly greased
cookie sheets, and bake in the center of the oven for 15 to 20
minutes, or until they are golden brown. With a spatula, transfer the
cookies to a cake rack to cool. Dust them lightly with confectioners
sugar before serving.
