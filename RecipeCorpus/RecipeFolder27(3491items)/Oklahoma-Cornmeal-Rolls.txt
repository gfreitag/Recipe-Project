Categories: Bread
Yield: 18 servings
1 ts Salt
2 tb Shortening
1    Egg, beaten
1 c  Buttermilk

3/4 c  Cornmeal

Shift together dry ingredients.  Cut in shortening until mixture
resembles coarse meal.  Add egg and buttermilk, stirring just until
dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
surface; knead lightly 3 or 4 times.  Roll dough to 1/4 inch
thickness; cut into 2 1/2 inch circles.  Make a crease across each
circle, and fold one half over. Gently press edges to seal.  Place on
a greased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes or until
lightly browned.
