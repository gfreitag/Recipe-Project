Name: Potatoes with Spiced Cheese, Tomato and Onion Sauce

In a heavy 8 to 10 inch skillet, heat the butter over moderate
heat. When the foam subsides, add the scallion and onions, and cook
them, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until the onions are
soft and transparent but not brown.  Add the tomatoes and cook,
stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the cream, coriander, oregano, cumin,
salt and a few grindings of pepper, and, stirring constantly, drop in
the cheese. Cook, stirring, until the cheese melts.  Traditionally,
chorreada sauce is served over boiled potatoes (or cooked string
beans) and often accompanies sobrebarriga.
