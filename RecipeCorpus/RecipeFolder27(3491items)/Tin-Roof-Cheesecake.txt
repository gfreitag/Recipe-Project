** ** Beat the cheese until light. Add sugar and beat again. Add
eggs, one at a time, beating after each. Add cream, cornstarch,
vanilla and mix well. Stir in nuts (optional).

Pour into prepared pan. Drop sauce in spoonful at a time and swirl
with a knife.

Bake at 350-degrees for 1 hour or so with a pan of water at the
bottom of the oven to keep the humidity high. Cake is done when edges
are firm but middle is still somewhat soft. When possible let the
cake cool in the oven with the door ajar but run a knife around the
edge of the cake to loosen from pan BEFORE it cools or it will crack
down the middle.

Cool several ours or overnight. Top with more fudge sauce and peanuts.
Enjoy. This one is rich so be prepared!
