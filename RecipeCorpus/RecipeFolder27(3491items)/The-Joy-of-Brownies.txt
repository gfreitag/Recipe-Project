Title: The Joy of Brownies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 c  Broken pecans or walnuts
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
4    Eggs
2 c  Sugar
Serve with vanilla or chocolate chip ice cream. If you really want to
indulge, add chocolate syrup or sauce to the ice cream and brownies.

Melt chocolate and butter over very low heat. Stir frequently.
Remove from heat and cool.

Preheat oven to 325Ã¸.

In a medium size bowl, beat eggs until light. Continue beating, and
gradually add sugar and salt until light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla
and chocolate-butter mixture. Stir in the flour, then nut meats.

Baking options: For 9 giant brownies, bake in 9 x 9-inch pan; for 12
large brownies or 24 small ones, bake in 9 x 13-inch pan. Prepare
pans by greasing and flouring. Bake 45-60 minutes depending on how
fudgy or cake-like you prefer them). Don't bake beyond the point that
a toothpick comes out a bit wet.

These can be served out of the pan. Allow to cool completely before
cutting. To remove from pan, cool 15 minutes after removing from
oven, then loosen edges and turn over as you would remove a cake. Set
top up to cool completely.

Yield: 9 giant, 12 large or 24 small brownies. Martina Boudreau, St.
