White stock is generally used as a base for delicately flavored
sauces. This stock adds little or no color to the final sauce.

Place the bones and water in a large stock kettle.  Bring to a boil
and skim well.  Add the remaining ingredients, turn the heat down to
low, and simmer for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Strain through a cheesecloth
lined strainer and allow to cool; then skim off the fat, and chill.
The cold stock will be quite gelatinous.

Yield:  About 6 cups.
