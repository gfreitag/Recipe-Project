4    Thin slices of red onion
2 c  Shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 c  Sliced Pepperioni (optional)
1 lb Loaf Italian bread -14 inch
1 c  Prepared pizza sauce
1/2 md Red bell pepper
1/2 md Yellow or green bell pepper
Heat broiler with rack about 4 inches from heat source.  Heat oven to

after bread is toasted.)

Cut bread lengthwise in half and place on a large foil lined baking
sheet. Broil two minutes or until lightly toasted.  Remove.  Let cool
for a few minutes. Spread pizza sauce evenly over bread, spreading to
edges to prevent them from overbrowning.

Separate onion slices into rings and arrange over pepper strips. Layer
pepperioni over or under pepper strips. Sprinkle cheese evenly over
all.

Bake for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.  Cut into serving size
pieces.
