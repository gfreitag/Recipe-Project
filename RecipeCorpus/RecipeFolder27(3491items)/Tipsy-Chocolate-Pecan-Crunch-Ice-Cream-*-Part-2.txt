Heat the heavy cream and half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan over
medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 cup sugar. Stir to dissolve and
bring the mixture to a boil, about 10 to 12 minutes.

While the cream is heating, place the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4
cup sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat
the yolks on high for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, then scrape down the sides
of the bowl. Beat on high, until slightly thickened and
lemon-colored, and additional 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. (At this point, the
cream should be boiling. If not, adjust mixer speed to low and
continue to mix until the cream boils. If this is not done, the egg
yolks will develop undesirable lumps.)

Pour the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine.
Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly, until the cream reaches a temperature of 185 degrees, 2
to 4 minutes. Add the rum and combine thoroughly. Remove from the
heat and transfer to a stainless steel bowl. Cool the mixture in an
ice-water bath to a temperature of 40 to 45 degrees, about 20
minutes. When the mixture is cold, freeze in an ice-cream freezer
following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the semifrozen
ice cream to the plastic container that is holding the chocolate
pecan crunch. Stir with a rubber spatula to thoroughly combine the
crunch with the semifrozen ice cream. Securely cover the container,
then place in the freezer several hours before serving. Serve within
3 days.
