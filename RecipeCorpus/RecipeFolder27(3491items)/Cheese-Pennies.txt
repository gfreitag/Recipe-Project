Preparation Time: 1:05 1. In a medium bowl, mix together the cheese,
flour, salt, mustard, and red pepper. Using a pastry blender or fork,
cut in the butter just until the mixture is moist and resembles
coarse crumbs. (To keep the pennies flaky and tender, avoid
overmixing.) Press the dough into a ball, roll in plastic wrap, and
refrigerate 30 mins. 2. Preheat oven to 350 F and set out 2 ungreased
baking sheets. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into an
18- x 12-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Using a 1 1/2-inch
round cutter, preferably a fluted one, cut the dough into 30 circles
and place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Using the back of
a fork, lightly flatten each circle twice, making a criss-cross
pattern, until the dough resembles a coin about 1/8-inch thick. 3.
Bake for 15 mins or just until crisp, but not browned. Using a
spatula, transfer the pennies to wire racks, dust lightly with
paprika, and let cool. Store in an air-tight container for up to 2
weeks or in a freezer for up to 3 months. Makes about 30 appetizers.
