large mixer bowl, beat the butter and lard together; add the sugar
and blend well, about 3 minutes longer. Add the beaten eggs and
molasses and blend. Add the flour mixture alternatively with the
buttermilk (flour first and last); do not overmix. Blend in the
baking soda mixed with the 1/4 cup boiling water. Pour the batter
into the greased pan and level. Bake for 30 minutes or until the top

As the cake is cooling a bit combine 3 cups of water, raisins, lemon
juice, sugars, nutmeg and salt in a medium saucepan. Simmer,
uncovered, for 15 minutes. Add the butter and stir until it melts. In
a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and remaining 1/3 cup water. Add
it to the bubbling sauce and cook until the sauce thickens. Serve
gingerbread cake squares warm with the hot raisin sauce over the top.
