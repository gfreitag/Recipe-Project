The real joy of owning and using a dehydrator becomes evident when you
realize that virtually nothing from your garden need ever be wasted
again. Every little handfulof extras can be dried and saved, complete
with vitamins, minerals and enzymes - not to mention their appetizing
color. We have dehydrated nearly everything we grow, with many
interesting results.

HOW TO USE DRIED VEGETABLES:  This whole activity of food dehydration
revolves, forus, around the need to preserve the real value ofevery
bit of food.  So, we are learning to use our wonderful vegetables in
their raw state.  What can't be used fresh from the garden can be
dried for later use.  They can be muched on when dry, or can be then
powdered to be used as soup bases.  When powdered vegetables are
added to broths, raw soups, salads and dressings, they not only make
a pleasant addition to the color and taste of foods, but they boost
the nutritional value at the same time. The following is just a
sampling of the vegetables you can dry..... But don't let this list
limit you in attempting other vegetables... Beets, cabbage, cabbage
blossoms, carrot & tops, chard, corn, cucumbers, garlic, green beans,
horseradish, kolrabi, leek, mustard greens, onion, parsley, parsnip,
snow peas, squash, tomatoes, turnips, and zucchini. Origin: Dry It -
