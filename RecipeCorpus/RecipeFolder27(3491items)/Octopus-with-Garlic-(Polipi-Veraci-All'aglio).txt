Title: Octopus with Garlic (Polipi Veraci All'aglio)
Categories: Italian, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
Salt
1 sm Green pepper, chopped
Rosemary leaves and parsley
2    Octopus (about 1 1/2 pounds
-each)
1/4 c  Olive oil
5    Cloves garlic, crushed
1    Bay leaf
Cut out the eyes and mouth of the octopus.  Remove the ink sac and
internal bone.  Cut off the tough points in the tentacles.  Put each
octopus on a board and beat them well to break the fibers and make
the meat more tender. Wash them in running water until they are very
white; do not dry but put them in an earthenware dish and season with
oil, flavored with garlic, bay leaf and cumin seeds.  Cover the dish
tightly with a sheet of waxed paper or foil tied around the top with
string. Put the dish over a very low heat for 1 to 2 hours, according
to the size of the octopus. When they are tender, drain them, season
with additional oil, salt, green pepper, rosemary leaves and parsley.
Serve in a tureen.

It doesn't make reference to it in the text, but in the pictures of
both these dishes, it shows one or two largish octopi garnished with
rosettes of baby octopi tentacles.  I imagine you'd do quite well
using the 'baby' octopi like those I see sold around here in the
supermarkets, or even with squid.
