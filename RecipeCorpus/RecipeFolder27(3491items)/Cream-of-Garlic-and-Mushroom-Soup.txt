2    Heads garlic
1/2 lb Mushrooms, halved
3 oz Butter (6 tb.)

Separate the garlic cloves and blanch them in boiling water for 1
minute, drain and peel. Sweat the mushrooms in the butter for 5
minutes. Lift out of the pan and keep to one side. Add the garlic and
thyme to the butter and mushroom juices and gently cook with the lid
on for about 10 to 15 minutes until the garlic cloves are just
tender. Add the flour and cook for several minutes. Turn up the heat
and add the stock and milk a little at a time, stirring well. Simmer
for 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and simmer for another minute to
heat them through. Remove from the heat, stir in the cream and season
with salt and pepper to taste. Serve garnished with the chopped
parsley and thinly sliced crisp, raw mushrooms, for texture. The
