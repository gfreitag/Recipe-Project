Title: Mrs. Field's Almond Crunch Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 18 servings
1 c  Almonds, sliced (4 oz)
1 c  Flour
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
2 t  Lt corn syrup
1/2 c  Butter, softened
3/4 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg
1/2 t  Almond extract
1/4 c  Almonds (1 0z) ground in a
Blender or food processor
Preheat oven to 300d F.  In a medium bowl blend butter and sugar
with an electric mixer until mixture forms a grainy paste. Scrape
down sides of bowl, then add egg and almond extract. Beat at medium
speed until light and fluffy.  Add the ground almonds and flour, and
blend at low speed just until combined. Form dough into 1 1/2 in
balls and roll in sliced almonds, coating each ball thoroughly.
Place balls on ungreased cookie sheets, 2 in apart.  Bake for 15-18
minutes or until cookies are slightly brown along edges.  Immediately
transfer cookies to a cool surface cover with waxed paper.
TO MAKE CHOCOLATE GLAZE;  Scald cream in a small saucepan then
remove from heat.  Stir in chocolate chips and corn syrup; cover and
let stand for 15 minutes. With small wire whisk or wooden spoon,
gently mix glaze until smooth, being careful not to create bubbles in
the chocolate.
When cookies are completely cool, drizzle patterns on them with the
warm chocolate glaze, or dip half of each cookies into the glaze.
Refrigerate the cookies on waxed paper until the glaze has set--about
10 minutes. Formatted by BXGT29B
