Title: Carne Mechasa
Categories: Tex/mexican, Beef
Yield: 12 servings
1    Bay leaf
8 oz Tomato sauce
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Flour
3 lb Steak; good quality
1    Green pepper; sliced in
- thin slices
6 sl Bacon; cooked, crumbled
4 oz Green chiles; diced
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
Make a deep horizontal slit in the steak to form a pocket and set
aside. Cook the green pepper in salted water for five minutes, drain
and set aside. Stuff the steak with the bacon, chiles, and green
pepper. Sew pocket shut. In a heavy skillet brown the meat in the
reserved bacon drippings, then transfer to a 12x8" baking dish.
Combine tomato sauce, sugar, vinegar, salt and bay leaf in the
skillet. Heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Pour
half of this sauce over the meat, reserving the rest. Cover the
baking dish and bake 1 1/2 hours, basting with the pan juices
occasionally. When meat is tender remove from oven and transfer meat
to a heated platter. Skim any fat from the pan juices, then add water
to the juices to make 2 1/4 cups liquid. Put liquid in skillet. Blend
reserved sauce with the flour, and stir into the liquid. Cook and
stir until thick and bubbly. Spoon sauce over the meat and serve.
