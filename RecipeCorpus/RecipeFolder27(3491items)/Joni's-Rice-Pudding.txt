Title: Joni's Rice Pudding
Categories: Dessert, Crockpot, Nuts/grains
Yield: 8 servings  Ingredients: 1/2 ga Milk Salt 1 c Rice long grain Cinnamon 1 c Sugar
Raisins 4 tb Butter (OPTIonal)

Description: Place Milk, Rice and Sugar and a pinch of salt into
Crock on Hi. Cook for 1 and 1/2 hours. Stir and at this time if you
like raisins add them, a couple of hands full and sprinkle in some
cinnamon. Cook for another 1 1/2 hours keeping a check on the last
hour stirring often. As soon as it starts to thicken turn it off if
you like it real creamy, let cook longer if you like it thick. It
will thicken a lot after it cools. I use skim milk, omit the butter,
and sometimes if I have it on hand add a can of evaporated milk,
gives a little creamer taste, but either way it is just as good this
way and a lot less fat etc. Submitted By JEROME GREENE   On   02-20-95
