Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Rinse chicken to remove any blood, and place in a simgle layer in a
roasting pan. Roast for about 1/2 hour, turning occasionally, or
until it begins to brown. add vegetables, mixing in so they become
evenly coated with chicken fat. Continue roasting until the chicken
is golden brown, and most of the fat seems to have been rendered.

Place bones and vegetables into a large stockpot, draining off as
much of the fat as possible. Add remaining ingredients; stir to
combine. Cover with cold water.

Deglaze the roasting pan with 1 cup of wine, scraping brown particles
from the bottom. Add to the stockpot.

Set the pot off to one side of the burner to make skimming easier.
Bring the stock to a boil and skim. Reduce the heat to a simmer,
loosely cover and continue cooking for about 4 hours. Skim
occasionally, but do not allow to boil.

Strain through a china cap or colander lined with cheesecloth.
Discard all bones, vegetables, etc.

Refrigerate stock. Remove any solidified fat from the stock before
using or freezing.

NOTE; Freeze stock in ice cube trays for use in individual pan
sauces, pint containers for gravies or in 1/2 gallon milk containers
for use in soups.
