PLACE THE MEAT in the freezer for 30 minutes to facilitate slicing.
Slice it against the grain into very thin slices, less than 1/4-inch.
Combine the beef with the wine, vinegar, garlic, onion, thyme,
marjoram, parsley, bay leaf, salt and pepper in a glass or stainless
steel bowl. Marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes, or up to 4
hours refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap. Drain the
beef. Reserve the marinade, and pat beef dry on paper towels. Heat
the oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and
stir-fry for 1 minute. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon, and
reserve. Add the pepper, onion and celery to the wok, and stir-fry
for 2 minutes. Add the reserved marinade, and cook over high heat
until the liquid is reduced by 2/3 and the vegetables are cooked but
still crisp, about 5 minutes. Return the beef to the pan, and heat
for 1 minute. Serve immediately. Serves 4.
