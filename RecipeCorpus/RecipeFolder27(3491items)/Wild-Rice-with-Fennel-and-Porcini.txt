Title: Wild Rice with Fennel and Porcini
Categories: Side dish, Rice dishes, Mushroom, Vegetable
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Wild rice
1 c  Diced fennel bulb
-(1 medium)
1/2 c  Red onion(s), chopped
2 tb Butter
1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms
-about 1/2 cup
3/4 c  Boiling water plus
1 c  Cold water
1/4 ts Salt
In small bowl soak porcini in boiling water 20-30 minutes, or until
softened. Slowly strain soaking liquid through a fine sieve lined
with a coffee filter into a small saucepan, being careful to leave
the last tablespoon containing sediment in the bowl. Boil soaking
liquid until reduced by about 1/3 cup. Wash porcini under cold water
to remove any grit, pat dry, and coarsely chop.

Bring reduced porcini liquid to a boil with cold water, salt and rice
and simmer, covered, 45-50 minutes, or until rice is tender and
liquid is absorbed (if rice is tender before liquid is absorbed,
drain in a colander). Transfer rice to a serving bowl and keep warm,
covered.

In a heavy skillet, cook fennel, onion and mushrooms in butter over
moderate heat, stirring, until fennel is tender, about 10 minutes. Add
fennel mixture to rice and toss to combine.
