Title: Plain Pastry
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
2/3 c  Shortening
5    To 7 tablespoons cold water
2 c  Sifted enriched flour
1 ts Salt
Sift together flour and salt, cut in shortening with pastry-blender or
blending fork till pieces are the size of small peas. Sprinkle water,
a tablespoon at a time, over part of mixture. Gently toss with fork;
push to one side of bowl. Sprinkle next tablespoon water over dry
part, mix lightly ; push to moistened part at side. Repeat till all
is moistened. Gather up with fingers; form into ball. For
double-crust pie, divide dough for lower and upper crust. Form each
in ball. Flatten ball slightly and roll 1/8 inch thick on lightly
floured surface. If edges split, pinch together. Always roll from
center out to edge. Use light strokes. Makes enough pastry for one 8-
or 9-inch lattice-top pie or one 9- or 10-inch double-crust pie.
