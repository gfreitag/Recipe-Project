THE CHICKEN, cut up breasts & season the nuggets with salt and
pepper. Place the flour on a sheet of wax paper, and beat the eggs
with the milk in a shallow bowl. Place the breadcrumbs on another
sheet of wax paper. Dip the chicken pieces in the flour, shaking to
remove any excess, then dip them in the egg mixture, and then in the
breadcrumbs. Allow them to sit for 10 minutes so the crumbs will
adhere. Prepare salad ingredients, and arrange them on 6 individual
plates or a serving platter. To make the dressing, combine the honey,
mustard, vinegar, salt and pepper in a bowl. Whisk until smooth, and
then slowly whisk in the oils. To serve, heat the oil in a deep-sided
pan over medium-high heat to a temperature of 375F. Add the chicken
pieces, being careful not to crowd the pan, and fry until golden
brown, about 5 minutes. The frying will have to be done in batches.
Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain well on paper
towels. Arrange the chicken pieces on top of the salads, and drizzle
the dressing over all. Serves 6. Note: The salad is even quicker to
make if you purchase the already-breaded chicken nuggets. You can buy
nuggets already breaded in the poultry case or the freezer case.
