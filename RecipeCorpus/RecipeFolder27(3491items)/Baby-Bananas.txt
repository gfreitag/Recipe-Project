Title: Baby Bananas
Categories: Mom's, Fruit, Kids
Yield: 5 1-oz-serv.
1    Ripe banana, peeled
BABIES ARE BIG ON BANANAS, FOR GOOD REASON--THEY'RE TASTY, EASY TO
SWALLOW, AND VERY DIGESTIBLE.  BANANAS MAKE VERY HANDY PREPACKAGED
SNACKS. NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT TUCKING ONE INTO YOUR DIAPER BAG.
EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO MASH A RIPE BANANA, BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER
WAYS TO SERVE THIS POPULAR FRUIT.  BANANAS TURN BROWN WHEN MASHED,
BUT THAT DOESN'T AFFECT THEIR NUTRITIONAL VALUE OR FLAVOR.  IF
DESIRED, ADD A TOUCH OF LEMON JUICE (AT 10 MONTHS AND UP) TO KEEP THE
BANANA FROM BROWNING.

Mash banana with a fork and add a little breast milk, formula, juice,
or water to adjust consistency if desired.

Makes 4 to 6 1-ounce or heaped tablespoon baby servings.

Freeze in heaped tablespoon mounds on a waxed paper-lined cookie
sheet. Place in plastic bag when frozen.

Also, frozen, peeled banana spears make a soothing teething food and
are a good way to preserve a bunch of bananas that all ripen at once.
