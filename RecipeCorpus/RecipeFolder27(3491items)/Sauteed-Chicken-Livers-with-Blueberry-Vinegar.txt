Title: Sauteed Chicken Livers with Blueberry Vinegar
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
1 pn Nutmeg
1 pn Cloves
Salt and pepper to taste
1 lb Chicken livers halved, trimm
1/3 c  Creme fraiche ( or heavy cre
4 tb Butter
4    Scallions chopped
1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1 pn Ground ginger
1 pn Mace
1 pn Allspice
1/2 cup fresh blueberries (optional garnish) Melt the butter in a
large heavy skillet and gently saute the scallions for 5 mins. Shake
the flour in a plastic bag with the spices, salt and pepper. Drop the
livers into the bag with the flour,shake them to coat well, and empty
bag into a strainer set over a bowl. Shake the strainer to remove
excess flour. Return the skillet with the scallions to the stov,raise
the heat,and when hot add livers and cook, turning occasion-ally,for
about 5 mins.or until livers are browned slightly stiffened. Remove
them with a spoon and keep warm. Add the vinegar to the skillet and
deglqaze over high heat, scraping up any browned bits and reducing
the vinegar to a few syrupy spoonfuls. Whisk in the creme fraiche and
boil for 1 min.  If you are using fresh blueberrie, add them to the
sauce and simmer gently for another 2 or 3 mins, just long enough to
heat the berries through without overcooking them. Arrange the livers
on serving dishes and spoon the sauce over them. Serve immediately. 4
portions as an appetizer, 2 or3 portions as main course. This is not
my cup of tea 'cause I don't like liver,bit if you do, it sounds
interesting. In The New Basics Cookbook, by the same ladies,they say
to use fruit vinegars in salad dressings with nut or olive oils.
Fruit salads are also enhanced by a touch of fruit vinegar. I hope
this helps you a little. I know it's not much..
