Title: Monkey Bread I
Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 servings
1/2    To 1 C Nuts
1    Stick of Margarine or Butter
1 1/2 tb Cinnamon
1    Bag of Frozen Rolls (24)
1/2 c  Brown Sugar
1 pk Vanilla Pudding (not
-instant)
Grease a bundt pan or tube pan with shortening, Place rolls evenly in
pan. Pour melted butter over rolls. In a bowl, mix the remaining
ingredients. Sprinkle over rolls, cover with plastic and let sit over
night or 6-8 hours...Hint, make sure nuts are not on the outside
edges as they will get pushed out...I found that mixing the dry
ingredients between and around the rolls works best...Put a liner
under pan in oven...can make a mess...Butterscotch Pudding can be
used...
