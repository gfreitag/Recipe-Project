While draining, prepare the Satay Sauce & Dipping Sauce.

garlic until the onion is wilting, approximately 2 minutes.  Add
curry powder & cook for 30 seconds.  Add coconut milk, spy sauce,
sugar, pepper, lemongrass & peanut butter.  Cook over very low heat,
stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.

DIPPING SAUCE: In a small pot, over low heat, dissolve sugar in the
water. Remove from the heat & stir in the vinegar, soy sauce & dried
chili flakes. When completely cool, add the carrot & peanuts & serve.

When the tofu has drained, slice each cake lengthways into 4 strips.
In a food processor, combine oil, lemongrass, garlic, curry powder,
chili pepper & sugar & process until smooth.  Pour this mixture over
the tofu strips, toss gently to coat the pieces & marinate fro an
hour at room temperature.

Soak 16 wooden skewers in water for 15 minutes.  Carefully insert two
wooden skewers parallel & 1" apart into each tofu slice.  Oil the
grill. On a closed grill over medium-hot coals, grill the tofu,
turning once, until browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Serve with sAtay
Sauce & Dipping Sauce.
