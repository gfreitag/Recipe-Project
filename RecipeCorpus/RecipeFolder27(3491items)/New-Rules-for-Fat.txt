First I'll explain some things about the new labels: Check the serving
size; if you eat twice as much at a serving, you'll have to adjust the
nutrient values. The saturated fat is now listed, because that is the
kind of fat that raises your cholesterol! As for cholesterol - less
than 300 mg. a day is the rule. Fat - 65 mg. a day if you eat about
2000 calories. Sodium? 2,400 - 3000 mg. a day. There are key words on
your food labels that are now STRICTLY defined. If your product says:
Fat Free Low Fat Lean It means: Less than 0.5g of fate per serving 3g
of fat (or less) Less than 10g of fat, 4g of saturated fat, and 95mg
of cholesterol

1/3 less calories or no more
Light (Lite)
than 1/2 the fat of the higher calorie, higher fat version; or no
more than 1/2 the sodium of the higher sodium version Cholesterol
Free Less than 2mg of cholesterol and 2g or less of saturated fat per
serving Shared by: Suzze Tiernan, Oct/94.
