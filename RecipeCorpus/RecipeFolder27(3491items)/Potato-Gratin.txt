Title: Potato Gratin
Categories: Vegetable, Vegetarian, Casserole
Yield: 5 servings
1 ts Kosher salt
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
1 md Onion, sliced into thin
...crescents (1 cup)
1/4 c  Soy parmesan substitute
3 lg Yellow Fin, Yukon Gold, or
...russet potatoes (2-1/2lb)
19 oz Pkg silken tofu, or two

1 ts Fresh lime juice
The lemon juice prevents a flat flavor sometimes associated with tofu
dishes, while yellow potatoes add a satisfying creaminess.

1. Cook potatoes in salted boiling water until knife easily pierces
them to depth of 1/2 inch.  Drain.  When cool enough to handle, peel
and cut into 1/8- to 1/4-inch slices.

2. Meanwhile, in food processor, puree tofu with lemon juice, salt,
and pepper.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

3. Spread one-fourth of tofu over bottom of 8- or 9-inch square
baking pan. Cover with layer of sliced potatoes.  Sprinkle with
one-fourth of sliced onion.  Spread another fourth of tofu over
potatoes and onions and repeat process until there are four layers of
tofu, potato, and onion. Top with soy parmesan cheese substitute.

4. Bake until potatoes are soft and top is golden, 45 to 60 minutes.
