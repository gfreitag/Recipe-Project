Title: Fresh Fig Clafouti
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Marsala wine
2 tb Water
18 sm Figs (to 20) OR 16 to 18
-med figs, OR 10 lg figs
1/4 c  Brown sugar
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
1 tb Vanilla extract
1/8 ts Salt
2/3 c  All purpose flour, sifted
Confectioners sugar
1 c  Milk
1/4 c  Heavy cream PLUS 2 tb.
1/4 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
3    Eggs
Half small or medium-sized figs and quarter large ones; set aside. In
a medium sized saucepan, bring the brown sugar, Marsala, and water to
a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Boil until a medium-thick,
golden brown syrup forms, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and
add the figs, placing them cut side down.  Let them soak for 15 or 20
minutes in the syrup, then turn and let them soak another 10 minutes.

While the figs are soaking, preheat an oven to 350 degrees F.  Butter
a round baking dish that is at least 1 1/2 inches deep and 12 inches
in diameter, or butter a rectangular dish measuring 12 inches by 18
inches.

To make the batter, combine in a mixing bowl the milk, 1/4 cup cream,
brown sugar, eggs, vanilla, salt and flour.  Beat with an electric
mixer until the mixture is frothy, about 5 minutes.

Pour enough of the batter into the prepared baking dish to cover the
bottom with a layer about 1/4 inch deep.  Put the dish in the
preheated oven for 2 minutes.  Remove the dish from the oven.  Lift
the figs from the syrup with a slotted spoon, reserving the syrup,
and arrange the figs evenly over the batter.  Vary the pattern,
placing some figs cut side up and others cut side down.  Pour the
remaining batter over the figs.

Bake the clafouti in the preheated oven until puffed and brown and a
knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Serve warm from the oven, sprinkled with confectioners sugar.
