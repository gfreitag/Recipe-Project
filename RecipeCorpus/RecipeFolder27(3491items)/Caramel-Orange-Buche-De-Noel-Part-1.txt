The buche de Noel, or Christmas log, was created in the late
nineteenth century by Parisian pastry chefs, who were inspired by the
real logs that burned on hearths throughout the night on Christmas
Eve. Our version can be decorated with Candied Cranberries or fresh
currants. Enjoy with a glass of orange liqueur or Sauternes.
