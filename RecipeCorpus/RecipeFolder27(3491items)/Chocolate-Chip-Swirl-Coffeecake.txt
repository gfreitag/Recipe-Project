Preparation Time: 0:50

1. In a 1-qt glass bowl, melt butter in a microwave on High about 50
secs. Stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, orange zest, and nuts until well
mixed; set aside.

2. On a lightly floured board, with a rolling pin, roll out Sweet
Yeast Dough to a 22 x 8-inch rectangle. Spread brown sugar-nut
mixture evenly over dough to wiithin 1 inch of edges. Sprinkle
chocolate chips over nut mixture; press in lightly. Starting from a
long side, roll up jelly-roll fashion. Moisten edges with water;
pinch firmly to seal all edges closed. Turn seam side down. With a
sharp floured knife, cut roll in half lengthwise. Turn cut sides up
and carefully move to a buttered baking sheet. Loosely twist to braid
the 2 rolls, keeping cut sides up. Bend braid into a 10-inch circle,
pinching ends together firmly. Let rise in a warm place until almost
doubled, 40 to 50 mins.

3. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Bake coffeecake 20 to 25 mins, or until
golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.

MOM'S SWEET YEAST DOUGH:

1. In a 1-cup glass measure, sprinkle yeast over warm water. Stir to
dissolve.

2. In a 1-qt glass bowl, heat milk to boiling in a microwave on High
1 1/2 to 2 mins. Add margarine, sugar, and salt and stir until
margarine melts. Let cool.

3. In a large bowl, whisk eggs until well blended. Beat in milk
mixture. Add yeast mixture and beat with a wooden spoon until well
blended.

4. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, blending well after each addition.
Dough may still be slightly sticky after adding all flour. With
floured hands, roll dough into a ball in bowl. Grease top of dough
with a little shortening, then place a piece of plastic wrap on top
of dough. Cover bowl with foil. Refrigerate overnight or for as long
as 2 days. When ready to use, remove from refrigerator and punch
dough down.
