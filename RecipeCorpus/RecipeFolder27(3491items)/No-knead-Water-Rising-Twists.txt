and yeast; blend well.  In a small saucepan, heat milk and butter
until very warm (120 to 130 degrees). Add warm liquid, vanilla and
eggs to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 2
minutes at medium speed.  By hand, stir in remaining 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 c
flour to form a soft dough. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap

sugar and cinnamon; blend well. Drop about 1/4 c dough into nut
mixture; thoroughly coat.  Stretch dough to about 8 inches in length;
twist into desired shape.  Place on greased cookie sheets. Repeat
with remaining dough.  Cover; let rise in warm place, about 15
minutes. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Uncover dough. Bake 8 to 16
minutes or until light golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie
sheets; cool on wire racks. Serve warm.
