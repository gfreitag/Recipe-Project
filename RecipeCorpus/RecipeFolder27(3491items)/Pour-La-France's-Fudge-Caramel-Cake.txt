Title: Pour La France's Fudge Caramel Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 10 servings
1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
2 ts Butter
1/8 ts Salt
1/3 c  Heavy Cream
2    9-inch layers of choc. Cake
1    Fudge Icing (Recipe)
1    Caramel Sauce (Recipe)
1 1/2 c  Cashews, roasted, unsalted
2 c  Heavy Cream
2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate
FOR CAKE: Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4
round cake layers. Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing,
Caramel Sauce and Cashews. Repeat with next 2 cake layers. Place
final cake layer on top, frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing
and cover sides of cake with chopped cashews.

FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil. Stir in chocolate until melted and
smooth.  This will be very soft but will harden when cooled.
Refrigerate until workable consistency. NOTE: The time it takes to
get to a workable consistency depends on the weather. This is much
like making fudge candy.

CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and reduce to thick
syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter), add cream.
Refrigerate until cool.
