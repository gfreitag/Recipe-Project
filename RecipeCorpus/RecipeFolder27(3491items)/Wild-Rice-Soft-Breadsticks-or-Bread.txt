Breadsticks: Put ingredients into bread machine in order suggested by
your bread machine manufacturer. Select dough cycle. Grease a large
cookie sheet. When dough is finished, remove from pan and place on a
lightly floured surface.  After pressing any air out of dough, divide
it into 15 equal pieces.  Roll each piece of dough into a 9-inch
rope. Place ropes on cookie sheet and brush with oil. Cover and let
rise in a warm area for 5-15 minutes.  They just need to rise
slightly. Brush breadsticks with a beaten egg if desired. Bake 15-20
minutes in a 375F oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from cookie sheet and place on wire racks.

Bread: Place all ingredients in bread pan as with the breadsticks and
select regular bake cycle.

Note: If you have a bread machine that does not make a large loaf of
bread, set the servings to 10 and you'll get the correct amount of
ingredients.
