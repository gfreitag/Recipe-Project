1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat cream until bubbles
start to form around edges of pan. In a large saucepan, whisk
together egg yolks, granulated sugar, and cocoa. Slowly add hot cream
to yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Place over medium heat and
cook, stirring constantly, 5 to 7 mins, or until mixture thickens.
Temperature should be approximately 175° to 180°F on a candy
thermometer. Do not boil. Remove from heat and add bittersweet
chocolate; stir to blend well.

2. Divide mixture evenly among 8 ovenproof 1/2-cup custard or souffle
dishes. Sprinkle almonds over top, dividing evenly. Cover and
refrigerate 6 hours or overnight. One hour before serving, place all
dishes in freezer.

3. Just before serving, preheat boiler. Sprinkle top of each creme
brulee with 2 tsp brown sugar. Place dishes under broiler 5 to 6
inches from heat and broil 1 1/2 to 2 mins, just to caramelize sugar.
Watch carefully since brown sugar burns easily. Serve immediately.
Any leftover creme brulee can be kept in refrigerator and eaten with
a day.

NOTES : Any bittersweet chocolate creme brulee is heavenly. You must
be
certain to freeze for at least 1 hour before broiling to
caramelize the brown sugar.
