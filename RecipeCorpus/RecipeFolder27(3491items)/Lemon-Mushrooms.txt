Lemon juice helps to enhance the sharp flavour of the lemon balm,
fennel, and dill.  This makes a good starter, served with lemon
wedges and french bread.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C or gas mark 4) or
pre-heat the grill.  Mix the herbs, onions, seasoning and lemon juice
with the butter.  Destalk the mushrooms and spread herb butter on
each.  Sprinkle some breadcrumbs and parmesan on each and bake or
grill for 10-15 minutes.
