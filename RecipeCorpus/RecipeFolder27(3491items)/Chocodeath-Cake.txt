MMMMM------------------------CAKE BATTER-----------------------------
3    Large eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1 c  Dairy sour cream
1 c  Water; boiling
2 c  Cake flour
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 cn Sweetened condensed milk
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
12 oz Caramels
Preheat oven to 350~. Grease and flour a 9x13 pan. Set aside. Sift
together cake flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Beat butter and
sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Blend in the eggs and beat
until light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla and melted chocolate.
Alternately, add the dry ingredients and the sour cream to the butter
mixture. Beat well after each addition. Stir in the boiling water.
(Batter will be thin.) Divide cake batter in half. Pour one half into
prepared cake pan. Bake 10-12 minutes or until firm to touch. Remove
from oven. Meanwhile, prepare filling. Mix the butter, caramels and
sweetened condensed milk in a sauce pan and melt over low heat,
stirring often. Can be melted in the microwave. When melted, pour the
mixture over the half baked cake. Pour the remaining cake batter over
the caramel mixture and return to the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes or
until firm to the touch. (It took me 25 minutes) Cool and frost or
serve with whipped cream or a la mode.
