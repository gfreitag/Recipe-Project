Title: Stewed Red Beans
Categories: Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
3    Bay leaves
Salt
1 ts White pepper
1 ts Thyme
1 ts Oregano
2 ts Tabasco, depending on taste
1 lb Dried red kidney beans
3    Smoked pork or ham hocks
1 lb Kielbasa, or smoked pork sau
4    Celery stalks, chopped
2    Large onions, peeled and cho
1    Large green bell pepper
2 ts Minced garlic
RINSE THE BEANS IN A COLANDER under cold running water, discarding any
pebbles or broken beans. Either soak in cold water to cover
overnight, or bring to a boil and allow to sit, covered, for 1 hour.
Drain. Bring the beans and ham hocks to a boil with 2 quarts of
water. Simmer covered for one hour, then remove the ham hocks, and
drain the beans. When the ham hocks are cool enough to handle, remove
the meat and discard the skin and bones. While the beans are
simmering, brown the sausage in a skillet over medium heat. Remove
the sausage with a slotted spoon, and add the celery, onion, green
pepper and garlic to the pan. Saute until the onion is translucent,
about 5 minutes. Place the beans, sausage, vegetables, ham meat, bay
leaves, salt, pepper, thyme, oregano and Tabasco in a saucepan with 6
cups of water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, and cook for 45 to 60 minutes over low heat, stirring
frequently. Stir frequently, especially towards the end of the
cooking time. The mixture should be thick and the beans should have
started to break up. Discard the bay leaves. Serve while hot. Serves
8. NOTE: The beans can be prepared up to three days in advance and
refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap. Reheat in a
microwave oven or in a 300F oven for 25 minutes.
