Title: Big Soft Pretzels
Categories: Mixes, Bread, Snack
Yield: 12 pretzels
5 c  To 6 c hot roll mix
1    Egg, beaten
2 T  Coarse salt
1 T  Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Oil or melted margarine
Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  In a large bowl, dissolve
yeast in lukewarm water.  Blend in 2 eggs and oil or margarine. Add 5
cups hot roll mix. Stir in additional hot roll mix to make a soft,
but not too sticky dough.  Knead about 5 minutes until dough is
smooth. Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/2" in diameter and 18
to 24" long. Form into pretzel shapes.  For pretzel sticks, cut dough
into 5 to 6" lengths. Place on prepared baking sheets. Preheat oven
to 425. Brush tops of pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle with
coarse salt.  Bake immediately 12 to 15 minutes until brown and crisp.

VARIATION: For a chewier pretzel, drop pretzel shaped dough into a
pan of boiling water. When dough floats to the top of the pan, remove
it. Preheat oven to 400. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse
salt.  Bake about 30 minutes. Submitted By MEG ANTCZAK   On   02-06-95
