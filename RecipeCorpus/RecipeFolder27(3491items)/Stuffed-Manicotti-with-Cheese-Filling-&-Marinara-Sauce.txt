=========================== > Directions < ==========================

Cook the Manicotti according to package directions, being careful not
to over cook.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium size sauce pan that has a lid, saute the onion for about 2
minutes, then add the garlic and continue for 3 more minutes.  Don't
brown the garlic or it can become bitter.  Add the remaining sauce
ingredients. Reduce the heat to low; cover and cook approximately 20
minutes or until the sauce thickens.  Stir occasionally.

Combine the filling ingredients in a medium bowl, stirring until well
blended.

Pour half of the tomato sauce into a 13" x 9" baking dish. Use a
pastry bag without a tip as a tool, or use a spoon, to stuff the
filling into the drained Manicotti tubes.  Layer the Manicotti on the
tomato sauce and spoon the reserved sauce on top.  Sprinkle Parmesan
cheese over the sauce and Manicotti.  Bake 30 minutes.

To garnish, sprinkle a little fresh parsley and place a few fresh
basil leaves on top. Serve.

============================> Notes and Credits <====================

I've added cooked, chopped, "squeeze-dried" spinach to the filling for
variety.  I've also sauteed mushrooms and added them to the sauce.
Italian food is really good and experimenting is fun! [shared by
