Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Anises; don't use
1 ts Cornstarch; mixed with
2 ts Water
1    Limes; cut for garnish
8    Chicken parts*
1 c  Low-fat yogurt; plain

*thighs or half breasts MARINADE: Combine the yogurt, lime juice,
ginger, garlic and  spices  in  a bowl and mix well. Place chicken in
marinade and stir to coat.
Refrigerate it for  2  to  8 hours.  Preheat oven to 350. Arrange
the chicken in a large/shallow dish leaving no more that 1" of space
between them.    Bake for 10 minutes...then spread the marinade
mixture over the chicken.   Bake until meat feels firm to the touch.
Time will depend on piece used.  Breast will take less than thigh.
Arrange on platter with lime slices. This  is very very creamy and
feels like you are  eating  a rich sauce. Calories: 273; Protein:
