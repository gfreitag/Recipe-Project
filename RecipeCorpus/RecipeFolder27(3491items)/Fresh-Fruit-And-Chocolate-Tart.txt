Preparation Time: 0:45 1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. To make crust, in a
medium bowl, combine flour, butter, sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and
pecans. Blend with a fork until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Knead
until dough holds together. Press dough firmly and evenly onto bottom
and up sides of a 9 1/2-inch fluted metal tart pan with removable
bottom. Bake 14 to 16 mins, or until golden. Let cool. 2. To prepare
filling, in a 2-cup glass measuring cup, heat chocolate chips in
microwave on High about 1 min, or until completely melted and smooth
when stirred. Stir in sour cream and remaining 1/2 tsp vanilla.
Spread filling evenly over cooled crust. Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, or
overnight. 3. About 1 hour before serving, cut peaches, nectarines,
kiwi, or cantaloupe into slices or crescents; drain fruit on paper
towels if extremely juicy. Arrange in concentric circles or other
design on top of chocolate filling. Fill in with grapes and berries
until top is completely covered with fruit. Warm jam in a microwave
or over low heat until melted. Brush jam over fruit. Refrigerate
until serving time. 4. Just before serving, remove side of pan and
set tart on a serving dish.

NOTES : This is a spectacular way to enjoy any fruits that are in
season.
Decadent beyond belief. Serve with whipped cream or creme
fraiche
on the side for added delight.
