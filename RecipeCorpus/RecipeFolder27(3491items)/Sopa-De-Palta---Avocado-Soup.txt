Title: Sopa De Palta - Avocado Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
1 ds Chilli powder
2    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Cream
3    Avocados
1 1/2 qt Chicken Stock
2    Stalks celery
Parsley sprigs
1/4 ts Nutmeg
This soup can be served hot or cold. It is important not to cook the
avocado for any length of time because it can develop a bitter
flavour.

Bring to the boil 1.5 Lt rich chicken stock, together with 2 stalks of
celery, roughly chopped, several springs of parsley, left whole, 1/4
teaspoon nutmeg and a dash of chilli powder or nutmeg. Simmer for
half an hour. Remove and discard the celery and parsley. In a large
bowl, beat together 2 egg yolks and 1/2 cup cream (or lower fat and
cholesterol content by substituting evaporated skim milk). Gradually
add hot soup. stirring constantly so that the egg doesn't curdle.
Return the mixture to the saucepan over low heat and continue
stirring until the soup thickens somewhat. Mash or process the flesh
of 3 avocados and stir into the soup until well blended. Serve.
