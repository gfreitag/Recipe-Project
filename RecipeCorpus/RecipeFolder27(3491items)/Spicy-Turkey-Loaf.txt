Categories: Turkey, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 10 servings
Ingredients
1 1/2 c  Chopped Onions
3/4 c  Chopped Green Bell Peppers
1/2 c  Chopped Celery
1 tb Minced Fresh Garlic
2 tb Balsamic Vinegar
2 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1 1/2 c  Evaporated Skim Milk
1 1/4 c  Unseasoned Bread Crumbs
4 oz Egg Substitute
1 3/4 lb Freshly Ground Turkey
Seasoning Mix
1 tb Salt
1 tb Sweet Paprika
1 1/2 ts Dried Sweet Basil
1 ts Onion Powder
1 ts Dry Mustard
1 ts Ground Cumin
3/4 ts Garlic Powder
3/4 ts Black Pepper
1/2 ts White Pepper
1/4 ts Cayenne
1/4 ts Ground Allspice
Combine seasonings in small bowl.
Preheat a heavy 10-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over high
heat to 350 degrees, for about 4 minutes.
Add the onions, bell peppers, celery, and 3 tablespoons of the
seasoning mix.  Cook until the vegetables start to soften, about 2 or
3 minutes. Add the garlic, vinegar, and Worestershire sauce and cook,
stirring two or three times to keep the vegetables from sticking too
hard, until all the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
evaporated milk and continue to cook until the liquid comes to a full
boil. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool to room tempurature.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
When the vegetables and liquid reach the room temperature, place
them in a large bowl, add the remaining seasoning mix and combine
throughly. Stir in the bread the brad crumbs and eggs. Add the ground
turkey and gently stir just until combined - do not overmix.  Press
the mixture into a 12x9x3 inch loaf pan and bake until done, about 40
to 45 mimutes. Per serving: Calories 198; Protein 29g; Fat 3g; Carbo
