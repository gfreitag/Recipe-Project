Title: Fesenjan (Braised Duck with Walnut and Pomegranate Sauce)
Categories: Middle east, Poultry, Fruit, Nuts/grains
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Water
2 ts Salt
Black pepper; freshly ground
5 lb Duck; cut into quarters and
;trimmed of all exposed fat
1/4 c  Pomegranate syrup; bottled
1/3 c  Lemon juice, fresh
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 md Onion; peeled and cut into
;1/4 inch slices
1/2 ts Turmeric
3 1/2 c  Walnuts, shelled; (about 1
;pound), pulverized in a
;blender or with a nut
;grinder, plus 1 tablespoon
;coarsely chopped walnuts
In a heavy 12 to 14 inch skillet, heat the olive oil over moderate
heat. Add the onions and turmeric and, stirring frequently, cook for
8 to 10 minutes, or until the onions are richly browned.  With a
slotted spoon, transfer them to a heavy 5 to 6 quart casserole and
set the skillet aside. Add the pulverized walnuts, water, salt and a
few grindings of pepper to the onions in the casserole and stir until
thoroughly blended. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat
to low and simmer partially covered for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, return the skillet to the stove, heat it until a light
haze forms above it and add the duck to the oil remaining in the pan,
adding more oil if necessary.  Brown the duck lightly, turning it
with tongs or a spoon and regulating the heat so that it colors
evenly on all sides without burning.
Transfer the duck to the simmering walnut mixture, turning the
pieces about with a spoon to coat them evenly.  Bring to a boil,
reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or
until the duck is almost tender and shows little resistance when
pierced with the point of a small, sharp knife.
With a large spoon, skim as much fat as possible from the surface
of the walnut sauce.  Combine the pomegranate syrup, lemon juice and
sugar. Add them to the sauce.  Simmer for 30 minutes longer and taste
for seasoning.
To serve, arrange the duck attractively on a deep heated platter and
moisten it with a cup or so of the sauce.  Sprinkle it, if you like,
with the coarsely chopped walnuts.  Pour the rest of the sauce into a
bowl or sauceboat and serve it separately.  Fesenjan is traditionally
accompanied by chelo. --- Silver Xpress Mail System 5.03M1 * Origin:
