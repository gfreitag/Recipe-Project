Title: Almond Roca
Categories: Candy
Yield: 6 servings
1 lg Package chocolate chips
1/2 c  Walnuts ground in a blender
2 c  (1 pound) butter
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Whole almonds
Melt butter over high heat.  Add sugar, stirring until it foams up
well. Continue over high heat, adding almonds.  Continue to cook,
stirring continually until mixture is color of mahogany and sugar is
all melted. (Take it off the heat for a moment if it starts to smoke.)

Stir as you take it off the heat permanently and pour quickly onto
your biggest flat pan with sides.  Tilt to spread evenly.  After 5
minutes, pour on chocolate chips. When they have melted a bit, spread
them over the top of the hot mixture with a rubber scraper. Scatter
ground walnuts over the top, shaking to distribute evenly.

Candy is thoroughly cooled when the chocolate is dull looking. (Cool
at least three hours at room temperature.) Break into pieces and it's
ready to eat.
