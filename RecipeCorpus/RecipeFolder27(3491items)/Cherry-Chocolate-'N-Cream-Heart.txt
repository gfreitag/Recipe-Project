Categories: Dessert, Holiday, Fruit, Chocolate, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 10 servings
1 ts Flour
1 pk Refrigerated pie crusts,
-15 oz.
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Whipping cream
2/3 c  Ice cream topping, hot fudge
21 oz Cherry pie filling
8 oz Cream cheese; softened
1 c  Sugar, powdered
1 tb Almond-flavored liqueur
Heat oven to 450F. Allow both crusts to stand at room temperature
15-20 minutes. Remove one crust from pouch; unfold. Press out fold
lines. If crust cracks, wet fingers and push edges together. Sprinkle
1 ts flour over crust. Turn crust, floured side down, on ungreased
cookie sheet. Using a paper pattern as a guide, cut crust into a
heart shape. Generously prick heart crust with a fork. Bake for 9-11
minutes or until lightly browned; cool. Repeat with remaining crust.

In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, powdered sugar and liqueur;
beat until smooth. Add whipping cream and beat until thickened.

To assemble, place one heart-shaped pie crust on serving plate;
spread with 1/3 cup of the hot fudge. Carefully spread half of the
cream cheese mixture over hot fudge. Spoon 2/3 of the cherry filling
over cream cheese. Spread second crust with remaining hot fudge and
place over filling. Carefully spread with remaining cream cheese
mixture. Spoon remaining cherry filling about 1 inch from edge.
Refrigerate until serving time. Makes 8-10 servings.

Tips: To make pattern, cut a piece of paper into a heart shape about
10-1/2 inches high and 10 inches wide. Reserve a small amount of
cherry sauce to drizzle in center, if desired.
