Title: Caper Oil
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 batch
Wide-mouthed glass jar
1 lg Jar of capers
Olive oil (approx. 20 fl oz)
Drain the capers and put them into the jar.  They should just about
half fill it.  Add olive oil to the top.  Let it sit for a week or
two for the flavour to develop.

Notes:  The authors say to use a good virgin oil, green and strongly
flavored; a sprig of rosemary can be added.  They also mention this
being used on a tomato and onion salad.
