2 T  Grand Marnier
2    Eggs
1/2 oz Chunk semi-sweet chocolate;
-finely grated
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
4 c  Heavy cream
4 T  Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Half-and-half
4 T  Instant espresso powder
6    Egg yolks
EQUIPMENT:  Measuring cup, measuring spoons, hand grated, 2 1/2-qt
saucepan, electric mixer with paddle, and balloon whip, rubber
spatula, whisk, instant-read test thermometer, 2 stainless steel
bowls (1 large), pastry bag, 8  8-oz coffee cups

Heat 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt
saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. While the cream is
heating, combine the egg yolks, eggs, sugar, cornstarch, and instant
espresso powder in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle. Beat the mixture on high for 2 minutes, scrape down the sides
of the bowl, and continue mixing on high until the mixture is
slightly thickened, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (At this point the
cream should be boiling. If not, adjust the mixer speed to low and
continue to mix until the cream boils. If his is not done, the eggs
will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into the
beaten egg mixture and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and
heat over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the cream
reaches a temperature of 180 degrees, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove
from the heat and transfer to a stainless steel bowl. Cool the
espresso-custard mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature for 40
to 45 degrees, about 20 to 25 minutes.
