Preparation Time: 1:15 1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Grease a 9-inch
springform pan. Dust with flour; tap out excess. 2. In a small bowl,
pour boiling coffee over chocolate and stir until melted and smooth.
In a large bowl, beat together butter, brown sugar, and vanilla with
an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2
mins. Beat in eggs until well blended, then beat in chocolate
mixture. 3. Sift flour with baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Add to
chocolate mixture alternately with sour cream, beating only until
blended. Stir in nuts. Turn batter into prepared pan. 4. Bake 55 to
60 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center comes out clean.
Let cake cool in pan. Run sharp knife around edges to loosen. Remove
springform side. Sift powdered sugar over top.

NOTES : This is a versatile cake that totes well to picnics or
potlucks.
It's fine with just a sprinkling of powdered sugar on top, but
you
can gussy it up with your favorite frosting, if you prefer.
