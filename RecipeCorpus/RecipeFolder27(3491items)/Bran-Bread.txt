Title: Bran Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Chopped raisins
1/2 c  Chopped figs
1/2 c  Broken walnuts
2 c  Bran
1 1/2 c  FOUNDATION SPONGE
1 ts Salt
1 tb Melted shortening
2 tb Sugar
White flour
Combine ingredients in order given, using sufficient white flour to
form a dough just stiff enough to knead.  Knead on lightly floured
board until smooth and elastic.  The dough should be softer than one
in which bran is not used.  This dough will rise slowly. When it
doubles in bulk, form into loaves and place in well-oiled pans. Cover
and let rise until double in bulk.  Bake in hot oven (425Ã¸ F) about
45 minutes. 2 small loaves. Mrs. W.R. Vaughn, Ferndale, WA.
