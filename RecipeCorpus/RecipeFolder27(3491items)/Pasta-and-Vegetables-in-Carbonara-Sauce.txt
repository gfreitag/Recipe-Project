Title: Pasta and Vegetables in Carbonara Sauce
Categories: Pasta, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 pt Light cream
1/2 c  Butter
1    Eggplant
4 oz Parmesan
1 lb Pasta
10 oz Frozen peas (or fresh ones)
10 oz Fresh spinach
1    Large onion
2 c  Sliced mushrooms
While the pasta cooks, cut the eggplant into 1 or 2" pieces and fry in
olive oil. Drain the oil and transfer the eggplant to paper towels.
Saute the onion (use a little of the olive oil but butter is good
too) till translucent, then the mushrooms and the spinach until the
spinach is all wilted. Melt the butter in the cream. Drain the pasta,
toss in a bowl with the vegetables and cream Add the parmesan last
and toss again. You can reheat it in the oven just before serving if
you prepared it ahead of time. From: Marianne Riolo-Minahan
