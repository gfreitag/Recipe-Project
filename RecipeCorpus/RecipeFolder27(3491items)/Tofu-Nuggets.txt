Title: Tofu Nuggets
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
1 lb Extra-firm tofu or soft tofu
...pressed and frozen, cut
...into 1-1/2-inch squares
Sesame oil for deep frying
3 tb All-purpose flour
6 tb Ice cold water
1/2 c  Fine breadcrumbs, lightly
...toasted
2 ts Salt
VARIATIONS: Unpressed tofu will cause the nuggets to remain moist
inside and crisp and brown outside...sort of like fried mozzarella.
Use pressed and frozen tofu and you may have trouble telling these
nuggets from fast food chicken nuggets.  If you mix 2 tablespoons
Sucanat or Florida Crystals with the crumbs instead of salt and
pepper.  The sugar caramelizes during frying, making these nuggets
into a sweet snack sort of like fried ice cream.

1. In small bowl, whisk flour and water to make batter with the
consistency of heavy cream.

2. On dish, toss breadcrumbs with salt and pepper.

3. If using soft tofu, press each piece in paper toweling to remove
surface moisture and minimize splattering.

4. In heavy skillet, add 1 inch oil and heat to 375 degrees.

5. Dip each tofu square in batter to coat, then roll in breadcrumbs
and drop immediately into hot oil.  Cook 2 minutes, turn and continue
cooking until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels and serve
immediately.  These cannot be made ahead.
