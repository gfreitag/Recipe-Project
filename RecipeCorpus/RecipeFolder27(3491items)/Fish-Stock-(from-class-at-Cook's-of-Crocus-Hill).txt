Rinse fish to remove any blood.

Heat oil or butter in a 4-qt stock pot, adding the vegetables and
cook, covered, over low heat until vegetables are limp and lightly
colored. Stir occasionally.

Add remaining ingredients and just enough cold water to cover. Set
the pot off to one side of the burner to make skimming easier. Bring
stock to a boil and skim. Reduce heat to a simmer, loosely cover and
continue simmering for about 30 minutes.

Remove from heat and allow to cool with the bones etc. in the stock.

Strain through a china cap or colander lined with cheesecloth.
Discard all bones, vegetables etc.

Taste the stock for flavor. Return to the pot and bring to a boil and
simmer another 20 minutes, covered.

Refrigerate the stock, covered. Remove any fat that has risen to the
surface before using, or freezing.
