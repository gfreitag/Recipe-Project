For best results, follow the directions carefully to avoid
undercooking the mixtures.  No candy thermometer is necessary for
this old-fashioned candy shop candy.

Line 8 inch square pan with foil, butter foil.  In small saucepan,
combine water and pectin.  Stir in baking soda.  In medium saucepan,
combine 1 cup sugar and corn syrup.  Cook both mixtures over high
heat until foam starts to disappear on pectin mixture and sugar
mixture comes to full rolling boil (one that cannot be stirred down),
about 3 to 5 minutes,stirring both constantly. Slowly pour pectin
mixture into sugar mixture, stirring constantly.  Continue to boil
for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat; stir in
peppermint extract and food color. Pour into foil-lined pan.  Cool
until firm.

Remove candy from pan by lifting foil.  With wet knife or
scissors,cut into small pieces or desired shapes.  Roll in sugar.
