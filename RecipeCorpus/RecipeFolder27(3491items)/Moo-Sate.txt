2    Onion, large; minced
4 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Honey
2 lb Beef; thinly sliced
3 tb Curry powder
1/2 ts Ground chilies

Slice the meat into thin strips, no more than 1/4" thick and about 1"
wide. Make strips paper-thin if possible. Mix curry powder, chilies,
garlic, onions, salt, lemon juice, and honey in a large bowl. Add the
meat strips and toss well to cover with the marinade.

Thread meat strips on bamboo skewers, 3 or 4 pieces per skewer. Make
sure that plenty of onion and garlic bits cling to the meat. Arrange
skewers of meat in a dish, cover with any remaining marinade, and
refrigerate while making the sauce.

Brown or grill the meat skewers and serve with the warmed peanut
butter sauce for dipping.

Sauce: Blend all ingredients together well to make a smooth sauce.
Keep refrigerated, but warm before serving.
