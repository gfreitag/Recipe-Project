Title: Biriani/Pullao Rice
Categories: Rice dishes, Indian, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
4    Cloves
2    Bay Leaves
2    Star Anises
2    Inch piece of Cassia Bark
1 ts Fennel Seeds
1/2 ts Black Cummin Seeds
1 pt Water or for tastier results
10 oz Water This is how the
10 oz Milk  Restaurants do it
1 tb Ghee
Spices:
4    Green Cardamoms
1    Brown Cardamom
For small appetites, use 8 ozs of rice and 16 fl oz water, for large
appetites use 12 ozs of rice and 24 fl oz water.

1. Soak the rice in water for about half an hour.

2. Rinse until the water is more or less runs clear, then strain.

3. Boil up the water (or water and milk).

4. In a saucepan (as heavy as possible, and with a lid), or a
casserole dish at least twice the volume of strained rice, heat the
ghee then fry the spices for 30 seconds.

5. Add the rice and stir-fry, ensuring the oil coats the rice and
heats up

6. Then add the boiled water (or water and milk) and stir in well,
put the lid on, keep the heat high and leave well alone for 8 minutes.

7. Inspect.  Has the liquid absorbed on top?  If not, replace the lid
and leave for 2 more minutes.  If and when it has stir the rice well,
ensuring that it is not sticking to the bottom.  Now taste.  It
should not be brittle in the middle.  If it is add a little more
water and keep on high heat a little longer.

8. Place the saucepan or casserole into an oven preheated to its
lowest setting.  The longer you leave the rice the more separate the
grains will be.  An hour is fine but it will be quite safe and happy
left for several hours.
