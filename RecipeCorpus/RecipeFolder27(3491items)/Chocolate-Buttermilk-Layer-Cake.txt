1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Dust with
flour; tap out excess.

2. In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugar with an electric
mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 mins. Beat in
eggs just until combined.

3. Sift together cake flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and
salt. Add buttermilk and flour mixture alternately to butter mixture,
beating just until blended. Divide batter between prepared pans.

4. Bake 35 to 40 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean. Let cakes cool in pans 10 mins, then unmold onto
racks and let cool completely. Fill and frost cake with Buttermilk
Chocolate Frosting. Refrigerate until serving time.
