1. Rinse the chicken well and pat it dry. Cut each chicken breast in
half along the breastbone line. Remove the fillets (the finger-size
muscle on the back of each half) and re- serve them for another use.

thin. 2. Heat the oil in a large skillet, add the breasts, and cook
over medium heat until they are lightly colored, about 3 minutes per
side. Remove from the skillet and set aside. 3. Add the shallots to
the skillet and cook over low heat until they are translucent, about
5 minutes. 4. Add the vinegar, raise the heat, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until it has reduced to a syrupy spoonful. Whisk in the
stock, cream, and creme de casis, and simmer for 1 minute. 5. Return
the breasts to the skillet and simmer them gently in the sauce until
they are just done, about 5 minutes; do not overcook. 6. Remove the
breasts with a slotted spoon. and arrange them on a heated serving
platter. Simmer the sauce gently until it has reduced and thickened
slightly, 3 minutes. Add the blackberries; cook 1 minute. Pour the
sauce over the breasts and serve immediately, garnished with chervil
leaves. Serves 4.
