Yield: 6 servings
13 oz Crushed pineapple; drain
2    Bananas; diced
1/2 c  Red Candied cherries; chop
1/2 c  Grees Candied cherries; chop
1/2 c  Nuts; (pecans or walnuts)
1 c  Sour cream
2 oz Cool whip; thawed

Mix all together well, turn into a mold and freeze. Let stand 10

too. It's especially pretty at Christmas because of the red and green
cherries but we like it for Thanksgiving too.
