No Ingredients Found
Use any thick legume, split pea, or lentil soup.  Puree briefly until
it has a fairly smooth consistency.  Dry as you would for fruit
leather, but instead of making one big tray, drop by spoons and make
soup 'pancakes'. You can use them to nibble on the way they are, or
drop a few 'pancakes' into cup or bowl, and cover with boiling water.
Steep, stir and enjoy.

These are light enough to pack with you for any camping trip. Origin:
