Title: Large Pearl Tapioca Pudding
Categories: Dessert, Pudding, Nuts/grains
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Brown sugar
Whipped Cream Topping
1 ds Salt
1 c  Large pearl tapioca
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
4 c  Water
1 c  Chopped English walnuts
This is another unique pudding and a very old recipe.  Cooking the
large pearl tapioca slowly for hours in a brown-sugar sauce gives
this dessert an intense flavor. The additon of English walnuts
provides a satisfying crunch. Frequently this pudding was cooked in
the oven or in a double boiler, but get ideal results, requiring no
watching, with a crockpot.
Place the tapioca and water in a crockpot.  Soak overnight.
Do not drain tapioca.  Add brown sugar and salt and cook for 12
hours on low.
Stir once in a while.  The tapioca becomes clear and the texture is
gelatinous at the end of the cooking period.  Let cool.  Add vanilla,
a bit more salt if needed, and the walnuts.  Transfer to a shallow
serving bowl and spread top liberally with Whipped Cream Topping.
NOTE: Large pearl tapioca requires long, slow cooking to become
transparent.  And each pearl has a tiny bit of starch in the middle
of it that sometimes never completely cooks up which, though edible,
looks unpleasant. The crockpot is absolutely perfect for cooking
these big pearls--and that little starchy bead completely disappears.
