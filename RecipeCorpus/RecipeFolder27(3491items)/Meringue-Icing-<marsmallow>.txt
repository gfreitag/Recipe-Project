6 tb Meringue powder
MMMMM-----------------ADD & BEAT STIFF 7-10 MIN----------------------

1/2 c  Warmed glucose*
MMMMM---------------------ADD AT END & BEAT--------------------------
1 ts Or more flavorings**
*Set a measuring cup in hot water & add glucose. Stir until warm and
thin. Add as directed above. **Add almond extract and <clear> vanilla
to taste. Add this only at the end, to prevent icing from breaking
down. Don't add butter flavor, may contain fat! Using "fine" sugar &
salt is not necassary as long as you aren't going to press the icing
through very fine decorating tips <#1,0,00, or 000>. I use regular.
This icing is like the insides of marshmallows without the coating.
It is the same as 7-minute icing without the cooking time. ***Be sure
all utensils used are grease-free. Any bit of grease will break the
icing down to soup.
Very good-tasting. Great to use this type when adding coconut
because it never crusts. Great to decorate with. Makes wonderful
flowers, but remember, they don't crust. I have made flowers with it
& they would crust ~ after a few weeks, but every time it rained,
they got sticky again. This icing is the type used by professionals
who do lots of big figure-piped characters, since it is sooo smooth &
especially since it is sooo light-weight. Dolores McCann, Oxford OH
