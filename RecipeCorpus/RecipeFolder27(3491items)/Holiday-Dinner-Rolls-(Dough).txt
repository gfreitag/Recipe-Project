Title: Holiday Dinner Rolls (Dough)
Categories: Holiday, Bread
Yield: 18 servings
6 T  Unsalted Butter  *
2 ea Large eggs**
3/4 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
3 1/2 c  Bread flour
4 1/2 T  Sugar
3 T  Non-fat Dry Milk
1 1/2 ts Salt
*I used Olive oil instead of butter. ** I omitted the eggs and
increased water to just over 1 cup. Process as per your machine
directions. When dough is finished, let rest for 20 min in pan.
Lightly grease (I use cooking spray) large baking sheet. Punch down
dough and knead briefly on lightly floured board. Cut into 18 equal
size balls and place in prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let
rise until almost doubled. Bake at 350 F for 10 - 15 min. From: Bread
