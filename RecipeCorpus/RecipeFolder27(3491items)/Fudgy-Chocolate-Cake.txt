Title: Fudgy Chocolate Cake
Categories: Chocolate, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
8 oz Bittersweet chocolate
1/2 lb Butter
1/2 c  Coffee; very strong
Prepare a 9" cake pan with a circle of buttered parchment paper. Wrap
the outside of the pan in foil to prevent batter seepage. Preheat
oven to 300~. Melt together the chocolate, butter and coffee. Either
melt in the microwave or slowly over hot water in double boiler. When
smooth and shiny, add sugar and mix well. Wisk in the eggs, one at a
time until completely blended. Pour batter into prepared pan and
place in the center of the preheated oven. Bake 1 hour and 15
minutes. The top will be covered with a crust, but the center will be
soft and appear undone. Cool in pan to room temp, then refrigerate in
pan overnight or longer. Cake will solidfy into solid fudgelike
consistency. To remove from pan, loosen edges of pan and invert on
plate. Reinvert on another plate. Press back any loosened pieces. To
serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar or cover with whipped cream and
chocolate curls. If you like, spread with raspberry jam before
covering with whipped cream. There is NO FLOUR in this cake!!
