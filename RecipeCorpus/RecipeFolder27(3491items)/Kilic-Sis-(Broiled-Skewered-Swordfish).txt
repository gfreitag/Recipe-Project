Title: Kilic Sis (Broiled Skewered Swordfish)
Categories: Middle east, Turkish, Fish, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
1 1/2 lb Swordfish; sliced 1 inch
;thick, skinned, boned, and
;cut into 1 inch cubes
20 lg Bay leaves
1 sm Onion; cut into 1/4 inch
;slices and separated into
;rings
4 tb Lemon juice, fresh
4 ts Olive oil
2 ts Salt
In a deep bowl combine the onions, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 2
teaspoons of oil, the salt and pepper.  Add the fish, tossing it
about with a spoon to coat it well.  Marinate at room temperature for
2 hours, or in the refrigerator for 4 hours, turning the fish
occasionally. Place the bay leaves in a bowl, pour in 2 cups of
boiling water and let them soak for 1 hour.
Light a layer of coals in a charcoal broiler and let them burn
until a white ash appears on the surface, or preheat a stove broiler
to its highest point.
Drain the bay leaves and remove the fish from the marinade.  String
the cubes of fish and the bay leaves alternately on 3 or 4 skewers,
pressing them firmly together.  Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons
of lemon juice and 2 teaspoons of oil and brush the mixture evenly
over the fish. Broil 3 inches from the heat, turning the skewers
occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is golden brown
and feels firm when pressed lightly with a finger.  Slide the fish
off the skewers onto heated individual plates, and serve with pilav.
