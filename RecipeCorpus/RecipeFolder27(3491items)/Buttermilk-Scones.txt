Title: Buttermilk Scones
Categories: Bread
Yield: 18 servings
12 tb Butter
1 c  Buttermilk
3/4 c  Currants
1 ts Grated orange rind
-(orange part, or zest only)
3 c  Flour
1/3 c  Sugar
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Heavy cream
1/4 ts Cinnamon
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 425F. Use an ungreased baking sheet. Combine the
flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a mixing bowl.
Stir well with a fork to mix and aerate. Add the butter and cut into
the flour mixture, using a pastry blender or two knives, or work in,
using your fingertips, until the mixture looks like fresh bread
crumbs. Add the buttermilk, currants and orange rind. Mix only until
the dry ingredients are moistened. Gather the dough into a ball and
press so it holds together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
surface. Knead lightly 12 times. Pat the dough into a circle 1/2-inch
thick.

TO MAKE THE GLAZE: In a small bowl combine the cream, cinnamon and
sugar; stir to blend. Brush the dough with the glaze. Cut the dough
into 18 pie-shaped pieces. Place the scones 1 inch apart on the
baking sheet. Bake for about 12 minutes or until the tops are
browned. Serve hot.
