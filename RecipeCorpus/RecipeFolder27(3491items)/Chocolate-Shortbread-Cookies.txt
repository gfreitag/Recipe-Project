Preparation Time: 1:05 1. In medium bowl, beat together butter and
sugar with an electric mixer on medium 30 secs. Add flour, cocoa, and
salt. Beat at medium-low speed until dough comes together, about 2 to
3 mins. 2. On a floured board, roll dough out about 1/4 inch thick.
With a lightly floured 2-inch star cookie cutter (or other desired
shape), cut dough into cookies. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased or
foil-lined cookie sheets. Refrigerate 1 hour it time allows. 3.
Preheat oven to 250 F. Bake cookies 45 mins, or until firm. Let
cookies cool on pans 5 mins, then remove to racks to cool completely.
NOTE: The low cooking temperature is critical to success with these
cookies.
