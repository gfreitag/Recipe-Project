Title: Hard Candy Bswn00a
Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------STIR TOGETHER BEFORE HEATING---------------------
1 ts Oil flavor* & color
1 ts Or more citric acid**
2 c  Cane sugar
2/3 c  Light Karo
3/4 c  Water
Have color/flavor/citric acid ready when finished cooking! *More or
less, some flavors are stronger than others. **Put citric acid in
fruit-flavored candies for tartness. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER EVERY DAY!
To test: Place it in cold water & bring to boil. If water boils at-
say 210 instead of 212, reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a
TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on
surface. Not too much & only once per session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT
HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan & the temp will rise,
burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to boil. Put lid on
for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add thermometer & DON'T
STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from stove.Wait for
temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric acid.
<Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake
supply shop or drug store.
I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire
recipe.> Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools &
hardens. *Of course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest
onto my marble slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long
cylinder & cut into "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with
powdered sugar so they won't "melt" together. There is one very nice
sucker mold. It is a white ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray
stick.> All you do is spray mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool &
remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes, round or heart-shaped. I beleive it
is Guttman Brand & available here at Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a
pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy. You will want to make
several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All vary. *Don't add
too much on the mints. Takes more on the
cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil
flavors available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton
