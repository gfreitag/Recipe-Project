Title: PUMPKIN GINGERBREAD LOAVES
Categories: Bread, Herbs/spice, Holiday
Yield: 4 servings
2    Eggs
1/3 c  Margarine or butter
1/4 c  Milk
1 tb Grated fresh gingerroot OR 1
-tsp ground ginger`
1/3 c  Finely chopped walnuts
2 tb Sugar
2 c  All-purpose flour, divided
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 c  Canned pumpkin
1/2 c  Molasses
Grease the bottom and sides of four 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 1 1/2-inch loaf
pans. Grease only halfway up the sides.  That way the loaves will
have nicely rounded tops and no unwanted rims around the edges.  Set
aside.

Stir together 1 cup of the flour, the brown sugar, baking

powder, cinnamon, and baking soda.  Add the pumpkin, molasses, eggs,
margarine or butter, and gingerroot or ginger.  Beat with an electric
mixer on low to medium speed until combined, about 30 seconds.  Beat
on medium to high speed for 2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl
occasionally. Add the remaining flour; beat for 2 minutes or until
mixed. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.

For the topping, stir together the walnuts and sugar; sprinkle evenly
over the batter in the pans.  Bake in a 350 F oven for 40 to 50
minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center of each loaf
comes out clean. Cool the loaves in the pans on wire racks for 10
minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans.  Cool thoroughly on the
wire racks.

To Freeze:  Wrap each loaf tightly in moisture- and vaporproof wrap.
Seal, label, and freeze for up to 6 months.  To thaw, let stand,
loosely covered, at room temperature for 1 hour.  Or, to micro-thaw,
place 1 unwrapped loaf on a microwave-safe paper towel.  Microcook,
uncovered, at 30% power (medium-low) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.

Makes 4 loaves, 8 servings each.
