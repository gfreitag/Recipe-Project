Teaspoon water
2 ts Active dry yeast
1 c  Medium rye flour
2 c  Bread flour
1 ts Salt
2 tb Dark brown sugar, packed
Add ingredients in the order listed. All ingredients must be at room
temperature. Select whole grain and baking control set for medium.
Press start. Bread will be ready in 4 hours and 10 minutes. Producing
high, moist loaves with whole grains is a very difficult when you're
making bread by hand. This is especially true when using rye flour
which has little or no gluten. Fortunately, the bread machine has
superior kneading action perfect for whole grains. Extra rising time
plus some bread flour to boost the gluten yields a loaf that is
moist, chewy and remarkably high in volume.
