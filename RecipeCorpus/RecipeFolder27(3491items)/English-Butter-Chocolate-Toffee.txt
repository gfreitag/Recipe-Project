Preparation Time: 1:15 1. In a large heavy 4 1/2-qt saucepan, combine
butter, sugar, corn syrup, and 3 Tbs water. Heat over medium heat,
stirring often, until butter melts. Cover and heat to boiling over
medium-high heat. Boil 1 min. Remove cover; place a candy thermometer
in pan. Cook over medium-high heat until syrup reaches 300°F,
stirring often after mixture reaches 250°F to prevent scorching. If
mixture begins to darken at sides of pan, reduce heat to medium. 2.
Stir in vanilla. Pour toffee immediately into a well-buttered 9-inch
square metal pan (do not use glass, or candy will be too difficult to
remove). Let cool completely at room temperature. 3. Turn toffee out
of pan onto a sheet of wax paper or foil. Spread half of melted
chocolate over toffee and sprinkle half of almonds on top, pressing
lightly into chocolate. Let stand until chocolate is almost set. Turn
over and spread uncoated side with remaining chocolate and sprinkle
with remaining nuts. Let stand overnight until chocolate is set and
completely dry. Break into pieces. Store in an airtight container at
room temperature.
