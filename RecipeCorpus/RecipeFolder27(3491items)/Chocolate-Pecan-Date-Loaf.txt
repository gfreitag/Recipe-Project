Preparation Time: 1:25

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Generously grease a 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan.

2. In a medium bowl, beat together butter and sugar with an electric
mixer on medium until light and fluffy, about 2 mins. Add cocoa and
beat until well blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after
each addition.

3. Sift together flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt. Add to butter mixture alternately with
buttermilk, beating just until blended. By hand, stir in chocolate
chips, dates, and pecans. Turn into prepared pans.

4. Bake 55 to 60 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean. Let loaf cool 30 mins. Remove from pan, wrap
immediately in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, at least
2 hours, before serving.

NOTES : This loaf is too moist that it will fall apart unless it is
refrigerated until it is well chilled before cutting.
