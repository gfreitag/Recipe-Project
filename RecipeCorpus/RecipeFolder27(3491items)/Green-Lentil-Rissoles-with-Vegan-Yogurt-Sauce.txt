Categories: Main dish, British isl, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM--------------------------RISSOLES-------------------------------
1/4 ts Cayenne
1/2 ts Coriander
1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Curry powder
2 ts Tomato paste
Salt & pepper, to taste
1 tb Parsley, chopped
8 oz Green lentils
1 pt Hot water
2 oz Margarine
1 ea Onion, finely chopped
1 ea Carrot, finely chopped
1 ea Green bell pepper, diced
2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
MMMMM--------------------------COATING-------------------------------
2 oz Breadcrumbs
2 oz Oats
Vegetable oil
2 oz Wholewheat flour
MMMMM------------------------YOGURT SAUCE-----------------------------
1/4 ts Cumin
Lemon juice, to taste
Salt & pepper
1/2 pt Plain soy yogurt
2 tb Parsley, chopped
1 tb Chives
1 ea Garlic clove, crushed
RISSOLES: Combine lentils & water, bring to a boil, reduce heat &
simmer for 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender (I think it
needs closer to an hour to get them really tender).  Add more water
if necessary.

Heat the margarine, add the onion & cook for a couple of minutes. Add
the carrot & pepper & cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add the
spices, tomato paste & salt & pepper.  Mix together well & stir in
the lentils. Add the parsley.  Allow to cool till it is cool enough
to handle.

Divide the mixture into 12 portions & shape into patties.  Coat them
in flour, dip in some oil & coat in the breadcrumbs & oats (I omitted
this step).  Shallow fry in hot oil until the patties are golden
brown on both sides.  Drain well & serve with the sauce.

SAUCE: Combine all ingredients together & chill.

MARK'S NOTE: The vegetables do need to be finely diced, it may well be
easier to use a food processor.  Also, if using the oats, I'd
recommend running them through the processor too so that they
resemble oat flour.
