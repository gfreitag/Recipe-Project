MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
4 ea Shallots - minced
2 T  Butter
2 oz Canadian Club Whiskey
Salt and pepper to taste
6 ea Venison medallions - 3" dia
2 ea Garlic cloves - minced

6 oz Whipping cream
DIRECTIONS
Pound medallions until they're all the same size.  To make sauce,
saute shallots and garlic in butter until tender.  Add mushrooms and
saute 5 minutes more (a mixture of wild mushrooms make this sauce
especially exotic).  Heat whisky in a small pan, add to vegetables in
saute pan and ignite.  Cook until flames die down.  Stir in whipping
cream and cook until it's reduced and thick enough to coat a spoon.
Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, panfry venison in a bit of
olive oil or butter over medium-high heat for 3 minutes in total - 2
minutes on first side, 1 minute on the second side.  Serve in a pool
of mushroom cream sauce.
