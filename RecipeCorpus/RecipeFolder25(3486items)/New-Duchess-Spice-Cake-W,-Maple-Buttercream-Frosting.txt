(regular only) 1/2 cup butter, softened 1 tsp.   maple flavoring
Tbsp.

milk Cream butter and shortening. Add maple flavoring. Gradually add
powdered sugar.  Gradually add milk and continue beating until light
and airy.  Add more milk if needed. Color with paste colors. This
icing is a light yellow and colors you add will be affected by this.
For pure white icing, use 1 cup regular Crisco shortening and 1/2
tsp. Wilton butter flavoring. This icing is somewhat stiffer. For
blazing white, add Wilton White White. Wilton White White will also
make the first buttercream recipe whiter, but be careful with colors
as they will still tend to be yellowish. Note: Excellent cake and
