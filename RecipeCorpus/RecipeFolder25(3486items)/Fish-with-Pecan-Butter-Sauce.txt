Pecan Butter Sauce  *
Meuniere Sauce
1/2 c  Milk
1    Egg
1 c  All-purpose flour
6    (4-oz) trout,
Redfish, or other fish
Vegetable oil for frying
6 T  Dry roasted pecans,
Corsely chopped
The fish are pan fried in this dish. see Lagniappe (Butter and Oil,
Pan Frying and Frying)Make the Pecan Butter Sauce and the meuniere
Sauce and set aside. Combine the milk and egg in a pan (loaf, cake
and pie pans work well)unitl well blinded.  In a small bowl
thoroughly combine the seasonings.  In a separate pan add 1 T of the
seasoning mix to the flour; mix well.  Sprinkle some of the remaining
seasoning mix lightly and evenly on both sides of the fish, patting
it in by hand (use any remaining seasoning mix in another recipe).
Warm the serving plates in a 250 F. oven. Heat about 1/4 inch oil in
a very large heavy skillet to about 350 FMeanwhile, dredge each
fillet in the seasoned flour, shaking off excess; soak in the egg
mixture; then, just before frying, drain off egg mixture and dredge
fillets once more in the flour, shaking off excess. Fry the fillets
in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side
(adjust heat as necessary). Drain on paper towels and, while still on
the towels and very hot, spread a scant 2 T of the Pecans Butter
Sauce over the top of each fillet. Serve immediately. To serve, spoon
a scant 1/3 c Meuniere Sauce onto each heated serving plate and place
a fillet on top. Sprinkle each fillet with about 1 T pecans.Chef Paul
