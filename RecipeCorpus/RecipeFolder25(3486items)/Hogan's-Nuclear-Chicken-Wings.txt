Title: Hogan's Nuclear Chicken Wings
Categories: Poultry, Appetizer
Yield: 2 servings
Ground Red Pepper to taste
1 tb White Vinegar
1/4 c  Brown Sugar
1 c  Bleu Cheese Salad Dressing
Leaf Lettuce for platter
24 ea Chicken Wings, Separated
2 tb Vegetable Oil
1/4 ts Garlic Powder
3 tb Habanero Sauce
3 tb Tabasco Sauce
These chicken wings are quite easy to prepare. Adjust the amount of
Tabasco sauce and Habanero sauce to your own tastes.  I recommend
though that you just cool them by dipping them in the bleu cheese
salad dressing rather than decreasing the hot sauces.

* Preheat oven to 375oF. * In a medium sized mixing bowl combine
vegetable oil, garlic powder,
Tabasco sauce, habanero sauce, vinegar and brown sugar. * Separate
tips from wings. * Place tips and wings on cookie sheet(s). * Using a
pastry brush, coat the wings with the sauce mixture. * Sprinkle
ground red pepper over wings and tips. * Bake wings for 15 to 20
minutes or until browning has occurred. * Arrange wings on leaf
lettuce and serve with your favorite beverage. * Dip wings in bleu
cheese salad dressing for some cooling affect.

NOTE: These wings can also be cooked on the barbeque. Wings should be
grilled for the same amount of time over medium high heat coals.
