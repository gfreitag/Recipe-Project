Place the eggs in a saucepan that comfortably holds the number you are
cooking.  Fill the pan with just enough cold water so that the water
come about 1 inch over the tops of the eggs.  bring the pan of water
to a boil Turn off the heat and cover the pan.  Let stand for 15
mintues. Drain the eggs and immediately place them in a bowl of cold
water.  Then the eggs have cooled, gently crack them on a hard, flat
surface to loosen the shells.  Starting at the large end where there
is an air space, peel off the shell and the thin white membrane.  Dip
the egg in cold water occasionally to help.

If you don't know if an egg is hard cooked or raw, simply spin it on
a flat surface.  If it wobbles, it's cooked; if it spins evenly, it's
raw. Origin: Cooking with Regis & Kathie Lee. Shared by: Sharon
