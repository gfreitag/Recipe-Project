Categories: Cheese/eggs, Dessert, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter, softened
1 1/2 c  Fine graham-cracker crumbs
(11 crackers, rolled)
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 c  Sugar
2 T  Butter, softened
1 t  Vanilla extract
16 oz Cream cheese
1 c  Sour cream
2 T  Cornstarch
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
Preheat the oven to 375
-degrees.
3/4 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Powdered sugar
For the crust, combine the cracker crumbs, sugar and butter and mix
well. Press the mixture firmly into an ungreased 9" pie plate. Press
flat onto bottom only.  Bake for 8 minutes, or until the edges are
slightly brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. For the
filling, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, cornstarch, and sugar
in the bowl of a mixer. Mix until the sugar has dissolved. Add the
butter and vanilla and blend until smooth.  Be careful not to
overmix, or the filling will become too fluffy and will crack when
cooling. Pour the filling over the crust. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes,
or until a knife inserted 1" from the edge comes out clean. Cool for
1 hour. For the topping, mix the sour cream and powdered sugar.
Spread the mixture over the top of the cooled cheesecake. Chill or
freeze until ready to eat. Note: If you decide to freeze this
cheesecake, defrost it for about an hour at room temperature before
serving. You may also defrost slices in the microwave oven if you're
in a hurry. Set the microwave on high and zap as follows: 1 slice -
15 seconds 2 slices - 25 seconds 3 slices - 40 seconds Be sure to
refreeze remaining cheesecake after slicing. From: "Top Secret
