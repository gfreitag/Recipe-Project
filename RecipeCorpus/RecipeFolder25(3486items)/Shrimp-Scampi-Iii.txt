Title: Shrimp Scampi Iii
Categories: Main dish, Appetizer, Microwave, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 3 servings
1    To 2 cloves garlic,
-peeled and crushed
1/2 ts Salt
Paprika (optional)
1 lb Fresh jumbo shrimp
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Dried parsley flakes
1. Under cold running water, remove the shells from the shrimp,
leaving last tail section attached. Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife
make a shallow cut lengthwise down the back of each shrimp and wash
out the sand vein. If desired, the shrimp may be butterflied (cut
lengthwise down the back of each shrimp, cutting almost completely
through the shrimp, removing sand vein). 2. In a shallow, 2-quart,
heat-resistant, non-metallic baking dish place butter, lemon juice,
parsley flakes, garlic to taste and salt. 3. Heat, uncovered, in
Microwave Oven 2 minutes. 4. Add shrimp and stir to coat well. If
desired, sprinkle with paprika. 5. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven
6 minutes. Stir shrimp occasionally. Cook just until shrimp are pink
and tender. Do not overcook shrimp as they will become tough.

Serves 3 to 4

Variation: If desired, lobster, scallops, crabmeat or any combi-
nation of these may be substituted for shrimp.
