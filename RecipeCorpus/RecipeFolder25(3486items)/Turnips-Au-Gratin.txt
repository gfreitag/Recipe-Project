MMMMM-----------------------BECHAMEL SAUCE----------------------------
Salt and freshly ground
-white pepper to taste
4 ts Arrowroot
1 1/4 c  Nonfat milk
1/8 ts Grated nutmeg
1.  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Lightly coat a 9x12 or similar sized
shallow baking dish with vegetable cooking spray.

2.  Place a layer of overlapping turnip slices on the bottom of the
pan, season with salt and pepper and top with half the bechamel.
Place the remaining turnips on top, season with salt and pepper,
cover with the remaining bechamel, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

3.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly golden on top and the
turnips are tender.

4.  Serve hot, garnished with parsley.

BECHAMEL SAUCE:

1.  Stir the arrowroot into 1/4 cup milk and stir until smooth.

2.  In a small nonstick saucepan place the remaining 1 cup milk,
nutmeg, and salt and pepper; scald until bubbles just form around the
edges of the pan.  Add the arrowroot, stir, and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer slowly, uncovered, stirring often, until
thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Use the sauce as soon as possible after
preparation. It tends to thicken up as it stands.
