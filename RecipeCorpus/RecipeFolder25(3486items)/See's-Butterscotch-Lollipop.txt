Title: See's Butterscotch Lollipop
Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
3 T  Light corn syrup
2 T  Butter or margarine
1 t  Vanilla extract
Nonstick spray
"You will need 12 shot
-glasses, espresso cups, or
-sake cups
For molds, and 12 lollipop
-sticks or popsicle sticks."
1 c  Sugar
Combine the first 4 ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir
until sugar has dissolved.  Let the mixture boil until it reaches 310
degrees on a candy thermometer (hard-crack stage), or until a small
amount dropped in cold water separates into hard, brittle threads.
Stir in the vanilla, then remove from the heat. Coat the molds with
nonstick spray and pour the mixture in. (If using shot glasses, be
sure to cool the mixture first so that the glass won't crack.)  Place
a small piece of aluminum foil over each mold and press a lollipop
stick or popsicle stick in the center. When cool, remove from molds.
