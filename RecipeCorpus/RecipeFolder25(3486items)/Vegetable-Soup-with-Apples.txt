and while on "Live", she made this recipe from her cookbook, Good
Food Gourmet. It seems the recipe was setn to Jane by one of her
readers, Marcia Flammonde of Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, who created
this simple soup for the annual Autumnal Peasant Dinner, which the
folks there give to salut Pocono mountain poetry (the fall colors)
and Professor Richard Leland, "who inspires culinary creativity." 3
cups chicken broth preferably homemade or unsalted 2 granny smith
apples, peeled and cut into 3/4 inch cubes 2 carrots, peeled and
lsiced 2 parsnips, peeled and sliced 6 oz rutabaga, peeled and cut
into 3/4 inch cubes 1 onion, peeled and sliced 1/2 cup chopped fennel

cinnamon 1/4 tsp ground cloves 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg 2-3 cups
water, as needed salt to taste freshly ground black pepper to taste
