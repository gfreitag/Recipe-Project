Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 oz Pkg. spaghetti sauce mix
3 tb Sugar
3 c  Corn flake crumbs
-- slightly crushed
2    Eggs; well beaten
1/4 c  ;Cold water
3    To 4 lb. cut up chicken
-fryer
3 c  Self-rising flour
1 c  Cornstarch
3 tb Seasoned salt
2 tb Paprika
1 ts Baking soda
2/3 oz Italian salad dressing mix
-powder
1 1/2 oz Onion soup mix
Combine first 9 ingredients in a large bowl.  Put the corn flakes into
another large bowl.  Put eggs and water in a third bowl.  Put enough
oil into a heavy roomy skillet to fill it 1" deep.  Get it H-O-T!
Grease a 9x12x2" baking pan. Set it aside.

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Dip chicken pieces one at a time as follows: (1) Into dry coating mix
(2) Then into egg and water (3) Next into corn flakes (4) Briskly but
briefly back into dry mix. (5) Drop into hot oil, skin-side-down and
brown 3 to 4 minutes on medium-high. Turn and brown other side of
each piece. Don't crowd pieces during frying.

Place into prepared baking pan in single layer, skin-side-up.  Seal
pan in foil, on 3 sides only, leaving one side loose for steam to
escape. Bake at 350 F., about 35 to 40 minutes, removing foil then to
test tenderness of chicken.  Allow to bake uncovered 5 minutes longer
to crisp the coating. Leftovers refrigerate well up to 4 days. Do not
freeze the leftovers.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
