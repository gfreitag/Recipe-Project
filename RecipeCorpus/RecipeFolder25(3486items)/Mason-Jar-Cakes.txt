Pumpkin "Cake-in-a-Jar"
-(Bill Segui)
2/3 c  Shortening
2 2/3 c  Sugar
4 ea Eggs
2 c  Pumpkin - fresh pureed (or
-canned)
2/3 c  Water
3 1/3 c  Flour
1/2 t  Baking powder
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease the canning jars. Cream
shortening and sugar together, adding sugar slowly. Beat in eggs,
pumpkin and water. Set aside. Sift together flour, baking powder,
salt, ground cloves, allspice, cinnamon and baking soda. Add to
pumpkin mixture and stir well. Stir in nuts. Pour batter into jars,
filling half-full. Place jars on cookie sheet. Bake upright about 45
minutes. (Cake will rise and pull away from sides of jar.) When done,
remove one jar at a time from oven. While still warm, place wax paper
circle on the top end of the cake. Wipe sealing edge of jar. Place
lid on jar and close tightly with ring. Turn jar upside down. (Cake
will loosen at this time.) Repeat with other jars. Leave jars upside
down until sealed. (Jar is sealed if lid remains flat when pressed in
center.) To serve: Open jar, slide a knife around inside of the jar
to loosen the cake, and remove the cake from the jar. Warm cake in
the oven if desired. Slice and serve with whipped cream. This dessert
treat is baked and presented in a wide-mouth canning jar. Because the
jar is sealed, the cake keeps indefinitely. It can be made well ahead
of the holidays.

Applesauce Cake Baked in a Jar (Oven Method) (Joan Johnson) 2-2/3 c

all-purpose flour, sifted 1/2 tsp baking powder 2 tsp baking soda 1
1/2 tsp salt 1 tsp cinnamon 2 tsp cloves 2/3 c nuts, chopped
(optional) Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs,
one at a time until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the
applesauce and water; set aside. Sift together the flour, baking
powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Blend the dry
ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts. Fill well
greased pint (wide mouth) jars half full. Bake in preheated
325-degree oven for 45 minutes. Remove jars from the oven one at a
time, wipe rim of jar clean; put on lid and ring and screw on
tightly. Jars will seal as the cake cools.  Store like canned goods.
If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
(about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid) and put it on top
of the lid, then screw on the ring. Make sure you screw the lid on
very tight.

**Ground cloves are strong. Unless you love the taste, I (the author

nutmeg and/or allspice. Boil 7 wide mouth pint jars, rings, and lids.
