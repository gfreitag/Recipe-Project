Title: Spiced Grape Drink
Categories: Beverage, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
10    Whole cloves
2 qt Grape juice; chilled*
1    Lemon; cut in 8 slices
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  ;Water
2    Cinnamon sticks
1 tb Whole allspice
*My note: Preferably homemade Concord grape juice.  It's not _that_
hard to make.

In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, water and spices.  Heat to a
low simmer.  Steep 20 to 30 minutes over a very low heat.  Strain and
chill spiced syrup.  Combine chilled juice and syrup, stirring well.
Serve in tall glasses over ice with a slice of lemon.

Note: Spiced syrup can be made in larger quantities and kept
refrigerated until needed.

Stuart writes: "This drink originated at a Shaker village in Ohio.
Prepared with homemade Concord grape juice - rich, sweet, and
slightly thicker than store-bought juice - the original drink must
have given the Shakers a taste of heaven on earth.  But even with
store-bought juice, the drink is delicious.  Every day at the
Creamery Restaurant tall glass pitchers of spiced grape drink are set
out on the long tables where visitors sit and eat together Shaker
style."
