Title: Instant Cappuccino
Categories: Beverage
Yield: 1 recipe
1/2 c  Sugar (adjust to taste)
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1 c  Instant Coffee Creamer
1 c  Instant Chocolate Drink Mix
-(like Nestle's)
3/4 c  Instant Coffee Crystals
If you have tried the commercial instant cappuccino mixes you may be
as disappointed as me in their lack of coffee flavor and their excess
of sugar.  I have come upon the following recipe that is tasty and
much more coffee like than the commercial instants.  It is also not
as sweet! Naturally it is not as good as fresh made but it is an good
substitute for the next time you go camping without the espresso
maker.

Combine all of the ingredients and mix well.  Use about 3 tablespoons
or 4 teaspoons per 6 oz cup of boiling water.
