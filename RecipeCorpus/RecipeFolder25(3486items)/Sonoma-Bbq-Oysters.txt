Scrub oysters thoroughly.
Place oysters on a hot barbecue grill and cook till their shells pop
open; or remove the top shell and broil in oven 3-5 minutes, until
lightly browned.
Serve the oysters with melted butter and warmed barbecue sauce to
dip them in. Some fresh crusty french bread and a good green salad
are all that's needed to make a Sonoma Coast Special!
