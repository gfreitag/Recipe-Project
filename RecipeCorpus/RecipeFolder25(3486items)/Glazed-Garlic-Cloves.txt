Title: Glazed Garlic Cloves
Categories: Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 6 SERVINGS--------------------------
1 ea Tb Sugar
1/4 t  Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
48 cl Garlic, peeled
1 1/2 c  Milk
3 ea Tb Unsalted butter
Place the garlic cloves and the milk in a small saucepan over medium
heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5
minutes. Drain the garlic, discarding the milk (do not rinse the
garlic) Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in the sugar and the salt, and then add the garlic cloves. Stir
so they are coated with the butter mixture. Reduce the heat to low,
and cook until the garlic cloves are carmelized on the outside and
very soft on the inside, shaking the pan often so they carmelize
evenly, 20-25 minutes. The glazed garlic cloves can be cooked up to 1
week in advance if stored, covered, in the refrigerator. Reheat in a
small saucepan, covered, over low heat. Source: Farmhouse Cookbook by
