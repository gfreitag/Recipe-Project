Title: Corn Bread/for Dressing
Categories: Bread, Dressing
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Buttermilk
1 t  Baking soda
1 t  Salt
1    Egg
2 c  Corn Meal
Or
1 1/2 c  Corn Meal
1/2 c  Flour
450 for 30 minutes

Add soda to buttermilk - add egg - beat well.   Add dry ingredients.
Bake at 450 for app 30 minutes.  Use toothpick to test.

Usually cook the night before or early in the morning before starting
turkey. This gives more time to let it cool before breaking up. Can be
cooked with turkey at 325 degrees for an hour.

This is a rather hard cornbread...not so great for eating by itself.

Combination of Old Mill recipe (Pidgeon Forge, TN) and Joy of Cooking.
