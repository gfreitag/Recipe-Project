Title: Swiss Steak
Categories: Beef, Main dish
Yield: 1 batch
2    8 oz. cans tomato sauce
8 oz ;Water
1    Onion; finely chopped
1    Celery stalk; diced
6 tb Flour
Salt and pepper; to taste
2 lb Round steak
Hot fat
Season the flour with salt and pepper and pound it into both sides of
the round steak with one of those mallets with little teeth/ridges on
it (which will help break down the meat fibers and tenderize the
meat). Brown the meat in hot fat in a heavy skillet.  (I use a cast
iron skillet).

Add the remaining ingredients.  The thrifty will measure out the
water in one of the tomato sauce cans, to gather up the last little
bits of tomato sauce, said Not Heloise.  :-)  Cover and cook over low
heat or in a 300 F. oven until tender, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours,
uncovering the last 30 minutes to cook the sauce down to a rich
thickness. Personally, I cook this on the stovetop.
