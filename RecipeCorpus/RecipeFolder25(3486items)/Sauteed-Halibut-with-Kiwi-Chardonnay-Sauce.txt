Categories: Seafood, Fish, Fruit, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Clarified butter
1    Kiwi; peeled and sliced
- into 8 pieces
4 oz Halibut fillets (8 oz each)
Salt
1/4 c  Flour (or as needed)

1/2 lb Sweet butter; cold, cut into

Salt (to taste)
3    Kiwis; peeled

Sprinkle the halibut with the salt.  Lightly dust the fish with the
flour. In a large skillet place the clarified butter and heat it on
medium until it is hot.  Saute the floured halibut fillets for 3 to 4
minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and just done.

On each of 4 individual serving plates place one of the sauteed
halibut fillets.  Pour on the Kiwi Chardonnay Sauce.  Garnish each
dish with 2 of the kiwi slices.

KIWI CHARDONNAY SAUCE: Place the kiwis in a blender and puree them.
In a small saucepan place the pureed kiwi, shallots, and Chardonnay.
Heat the ingredients on high heat and cook them for 4 to 6 minutes,
or until the liquid is reduced to 3 tablespoons.  Reduce the heat to
medium.

While whisking constantly, add the butter cubes one at a time.  Add
the salt and stir it in.  Remove the sauce from the heat and keep it
warm until you are ready to serve it.
