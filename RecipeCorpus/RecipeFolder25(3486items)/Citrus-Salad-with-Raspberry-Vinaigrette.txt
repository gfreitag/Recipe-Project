The orange, grapefruit, and asian pear should be peeled,
sectioned and all of the membrane should be removed.

Any mixed greens that you would like to eat "raw" can be mixed
and placed in a mound in the middle of a round plate (individual
serving). Around this mound of greens, arrange alternating slices of
pear, orange and grapefruit.

To add a variety of flavors and textures to the salad, toss in
any desired amount of any or all of the following: thin slices of
water chestnut, julienne strips of purple onion, little bits of
candied ginger, and toasted walnuts.

For the dressing, mix all of the ingredients together in a
blender, or whisk them together vigorously.  If you like a little
sweetness to your vinaigrette dressings, add a little honey, or a
little brown sugar and mix in thoroughly.

Drizzle the dressing over the salad and serve.
