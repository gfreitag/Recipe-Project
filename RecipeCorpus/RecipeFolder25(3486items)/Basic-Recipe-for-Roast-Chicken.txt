Title: Basic Recipe for Roast Chicken
Categories: Chicken, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper
Aromatics (eg herbs,
-citrus peel, onions)
1/4 c  Melted butter
1    Chicken (3 1/2 to 5 lb)
-rinsed and dried
-giblets, kidneys, and
-excess fat removed
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 500ø. Elevate and
lightly oil roasting rack.

2. Season cavity with salt and pepper to taste; place aromatics in
cavity. Pin flaps of skin at leg end together. If legs splay badly,
tie drumstick ends loosely together. Arrange chicken, backside up, on
rack.

3. Roast chicken, brushing bird with butter or pan juices every 8 to
10 minutes. If pan juices begin to spatter loudly, add a few
tablespoons of water to pan; repeat as necessary.

4. After 20 minutes for a small chicken, to 30 minutes for a chicken
approaching 5 pounds, season legs and turn chicken, breast side up,
pouring juices from body cavity into pan. Prop up the breast end with
1-inch-thick wad of foil under the back. Baste and return to oven.

5. Roast chicken, basting every 7 to 8 minutes, until breast side has
browned sufficiently. Turn oven down to 325ø and prop oven door open
for a minute or two to quickly bring the temperature down. After 40
minutes total cooking time (50 minutes for large birds) season breast
and legs, then check inner breast temperature by inserting
thermometer from neck-end along ribs. When thermometer registers 148
to 150 degrees, the breast is done. Figure on breast temperature
rising 2 degrees (larger birds) to 3 degrees (small birds) for every
additional minute in oven. When breast is done, insert thermometer
into thigh meat closest to body; it should read at least 160 degrees.

6. When chicken is done, tip cavity juices into pan and poke skin
below thigh to release under-skin juices. Transfer chicken with rack
to a plate, let rest for at least 20 minutes before serving.
