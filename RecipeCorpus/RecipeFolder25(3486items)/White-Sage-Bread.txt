Title: White Sage Bread
Categories: Native amer, Bread
Yield: 2 loaves
1/4 c  Lukewarm water
1    Egg
1 c  Cottage cheese
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
Crushed, roasted pinons or
-coarse salt (optional)
2 1/2 c  All purpose flour
2 ts Finely chopped fresh white
-sage leaves
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 pk Active dry yeast (1/4 oz)
In a bowl, combine the flour, sage, salt and baking soda.

Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water.

In a food processor, blend the egg and cottage cheese until smooth;
add 1 tablespoon of the butter and all the yeast water, mix again,
and transfer to a large bowl.  Gradually add the flour mixture,
kneading vigorously after each addition, until a stiff dough is
formed. Cover with a dry cloth and let rest in a warm place until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch down the dough and knead it on a lightly floured surface about 4
minutes.  Divide the dough in half and shape each part into a ball.
Place the dough balls on a baking sheet, cover with a dry cloth and
let rise 15 minutes more.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bake the bread about 40 minutes, until well risen, golden, and hollow
sounding when tapped.  Brush the top with the remaining butter and
sprinkle with crushed roasted pinons or coarse salt if desired.
********

White sage, which grows in abundance throughout most regions of the
Southwest, is an aromatic herb used in a variety of dishes.  Ordinary
fresh sage can also be used.

This bread freezes well, so I suggest making several loaves at a time.
