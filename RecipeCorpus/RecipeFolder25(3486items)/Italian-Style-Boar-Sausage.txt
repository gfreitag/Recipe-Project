To prepare pork: Lay the fresh ham out flat in a roasting pan just
large enough to accomodate it. Pour the remaining inredients over the
meat and marinate for four days. Keep refrigerated and turn at least
once, but preferably twice a day. At the end of the marinating time,
pat the meat dry, removing any pieces of spices clinging to it and
use as you would fresh boar meat.

Sausage: Prepare casings. Mix all ingredients and grind using the
coarse disk. Stuff casings and twist off into 3-4" links. Prepare as
you would any fresh sausage.
