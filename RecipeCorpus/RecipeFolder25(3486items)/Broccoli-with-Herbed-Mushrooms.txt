Title: Broccoli with Herbed Mushrooms
Categories: Diabetic, Side dish, Vegetable, Mushroom
Yield: 4 sweet ones
1 ts Dried thyme leaves;
2 tb Margarine; or butter
1/4 md Onion; (my own idea)
1 lb Broccoli;
4 oz Mushrooms; sliced
-about 1 1/2 cup
1/2 ts Instant beef bouillon;
Cut broccoli stalks lengthwise into thin spears. Place steamer basket
in 1/2" water in saucepan or skillet (water should not touch the
bottom of basket).  Place broccoli in basket.  Cover tightly and heat
to boiling; reduce heat. Steam until tender, about 15 minutes.  Cook
and stir mushrooms, bouillion, and thyme  in margaine until mushrooms
are hot, about 3 minutes.  Toss with broccoli. Food Exchanges per
serving: About 1 VEGETABLES EXCHANGE + 1 FAT EXCHANGE ( I cook this
as a side dish and use the microwave to reduce the fat exchange. Also
I add a tad bit of onion!!) Source: Betty Crocker's New American
