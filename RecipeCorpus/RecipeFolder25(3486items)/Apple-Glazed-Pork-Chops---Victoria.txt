To make Herbed Pork Chops:

1. Preheat oven to 325F. Rub pork chops on both sides with thyme,

medium heat 10 minutes on each side. Repeat@ browning remaining chops.

3. Arrange chops in roasting pan, reserving drippings in skillet for
sauce. Pour beef broth over chops.

4. Cover and bake at 325F for 2 hours until fork tender.

To make Apple Cider Glaze: 1. While pork chops are baking, measure
sugar into a bowl and set aside.

2. In heavy 6-quart pot, combine apples cider, pectin, and grated
zests. Stir until pectin dissolves. Cook, stirring constantly, over
medium high heat until apples are soft and mixture comes to a boil,
about 5 minutes.

constantly, to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down. Boil
65 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.

inch headspace. Seal and refrigerate up to 2 months to use as jam on
toast and muffins.

from oven. Keep pork chops warm on platter. Strain pan juices and
skim off fat. Measure 3 C pan juices.

2. Melt butter in skillet with reserved pork chop pan drippings. Stir
in flour until blended.

3. Whisk in pan juices from chops and wine. Cook over medium high heat
stirring constantly, until thickened and boiling. Reduce heat to
medium low and simmer 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.

chop in center of each plate. Spoon warm apple glaze over chops.
