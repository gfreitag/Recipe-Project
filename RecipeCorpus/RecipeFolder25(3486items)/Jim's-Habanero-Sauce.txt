Title: Jim's Habanero Sauce
Categories: Condiment, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 servings
4 md Habanero Peppers
1/8 ts Salt, Non Iodized
8 tb White Vinegar
12 tb Water
6    Cloves Garlic
Place all ingredients in a blender and liquefy. Pour into a sauce pan
and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook to desired
thickness. Pass through a strainer to remove pepper seeds. Reserve
garlic bits and pepper pieces. While still hot pour into a 1/2 pint
canning jar and seal, or use immediately. Add pepper and garlic
pieces if desired.

NOTE: This sauce will be off white or yellowish in color. This leads
me to believe that commercial sauces use a red dye.
