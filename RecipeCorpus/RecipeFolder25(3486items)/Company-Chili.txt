Title: Company Chili
Categories: Beef, Casserole, Chili
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Beef broth
1/3 ts Salt
1 ds Ground pepper, to taste
15 oz Can pinto or chili beans
1 pk Sour cream, as needed
2    Lime, as needed
3 lb Beef chuck or round steak
2 tb Cooking oil
2    Garlic coves, minced
4 tb Chili powder
2 ts Ground cumin
3 tb All purpose flour
1 tb Oregano
ONE DAY IN ADVANCE: Cut the beef into 1-inch pieces. In a skillet
heat oil to hot. Add beef. Stir until color changes but does not
brown. Lower heat, stir in garlic. Combine chili powder, cumin and
flour. Sprinkle meat with chili mixture, stirring until meat is
evenly coated. Crumble oregano over meat. Add 2 cups beef broth and
stir until liquid is well blended. Add salt and pepper. Bring to a
boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat; simmer partially covered
over low heat for 1-1/2 hours. Add remaining broth and simmer 30
minutes longer. Meat should be almost falling apart. Cool well,
refrigerate over night to "ripen" flavor. (This is most important.)
Reheat on top of double-boiler. Heat beans, drain, stir into chili.
Serve on individual plates, adding a good dollop of sour cream.
Squeeze lime juice over each portion. Cut the other lime into wedges
and place a wedge onto each plate. Serve with hot corn bread and
various fresh fruits. From: Minneapolis Tribune
