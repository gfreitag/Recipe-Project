Title: Japanese Chicken Baked in Foil
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Japanese, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Pure vegetable oil
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2    Lemon, thinly sliced
Hot Rice
1    3 lb chicken, quartered
2 tb White sesame seeds
3    Green onions, including the
-tops, finely chopped
1 ts Sugar
Wash the chicken thoroughly, and pat dry with paper towels.  In a dry
skillet, toast the sesame seeds just until they begin to jump; watch
carefully that they don't burn.  Remove from pan.  Crush the seeds in
a mortar with a pestle, in a blender, or in a nut grinder.

In a shallow glass baking dish, mix together the ground sesame seeds,
green onions, sugar and soy sauce.  Marinate the chicken pieces in
this mixture for 30 min, turning the chicken once.

Meanwhile, cut pieces of foil large enough to wrap each piece of
chicken securely.  Rub the foil with the oil.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Place a piece of chicken in the center of
each piece of foil; sprinkle each with a pinch of the pepper, and top
with a slice of lemon.  Wrap tightly.  Bake for 30 - 40 min, or until
the chicken is tender.  Serve with hot rice.
