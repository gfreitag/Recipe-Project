Title: Scampi Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 1 servings
-garlic powder (NOT
SALT), dehydrated parsley,
-and chablis wine (the
-inexpensive stuff that
Comes in a box).
Bob ++ To make the scampi
-sauce, you will need
-liquid butter sauce
(Mrs. Shedd's liquid
-margarine does nicely),
For a cup of the liquid margarine, you will need about 4 tablespoons
of garlic powder, (or more to taste), a teaspoon of onion powder and
about a teaspoon of parsley.  Add about 4 tablespoons of wine to
this, and combine very well.  Add salt to taste.  This sauce will be
slightly thinner than the Lobster's, which also contains yeast and a
few other ingredients that affect the thickness, but not the taste.
Shell and de-vein 11 medium (41-50 count) shrimp.  Spiral the shrimp
into an oval baking dish, and cover with one ounce of sauce.  Broil
under a VERY hot (500 degree) broiler just until shrimp turns pink.
Glad you like the Lobster's food. For a chain, serving mass
quantities of food to mass quantities of people, I think we do
remarkably well. However, if you liked our Shrimp Scampi, may I offer
the following, which is not suited for mass consumption, and is (in
my opinion, anyway) better: Camarones en Mojo de Ajo 1 pound large
shrimp, shelled and de-veined 1/2 pound butter (the real stuff,
please), clarified 8-10 cloves of garlic, chopped 3-4 Tablespoons
fresh parsley, chopped Heat the clarified butter in a large frying
pan.  Add the garlic, and cook over medium heat until the garlic
begins to brown.  Do NOT allow the garlic to burn, or it will be
bitter.  Add the shrimp, and cook, stirring frequently, until it
turns pink.  Top with chopped parsley. Serve with lots of French
bread to sop up the garlic butter. Kathy Pitts Bryan, TX
