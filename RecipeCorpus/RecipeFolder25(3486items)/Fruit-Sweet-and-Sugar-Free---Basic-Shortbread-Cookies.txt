Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Basic Shortbread Cookies
Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 dozen
1/8 t  Salt
2 t  Vanilla extract
2 c  +2T white flour
1/2 c  Nuts (almonds, walnuts
Pecans, hazelnuts or combo)
1 c  Butter (1/2 pound)
9 T  Fruit sweetener
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the nuts in the preheated oven
for 7 to ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the nuts cool. Then
process in a food process using the pulsing action, until they are
finely chopped. Cream together the butter and sweetener. When light
and fluffy, add the remaining ingredients in the order listed, mixing
just to blend. Stir in the nuts. Cover the dough and refrigerate it
for 20 minutes to make it easier to handle. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees and line baking sheets with parchment paper.

Shortbread cookies can be formed in 2 ways:

1. Form the dough into walnut sized balls. Roll the balls in finely
ground nuts and flatten them to 1/3 inch thickness; or

2. Roll the dough out 1/4 inch thick and cut it into different shapes
with cookie cutters.

Place the cookies 1 inch apart on insulated baking sheets. Bake until
lightly browned around the edges, approximately 15-20 minutes. Remove
the cookies to a wire rack to cool.
