Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Spice Cookies
Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie
Yield: 32 cookies
3/4 t  Cloves
1/2 t  Ginger
1/2 t  Nutmeg
2 t  Baking soda
1/8 t  Salt
2 c  White flour
1 3/4 c  Walnuts
3/4 c  Butter
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
2 1/2 T  Unsulphured molasses
1    Egg
1 t  Cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the walnuts in the preheated
oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the nuts cool, then
using the pulsing action in a food processor, grind the walnuts until
they are finely ground. Do not over process or you will end up with a
paste. Cream the butter with the fruit sweetener and the molasses.
When light and fluffly, add the egg and beat together for three
minutes. Stir in the spices, baking soda and salt. When mixed add the
flour and one cup of the finely ground walnuts. Cover the dough and
refrigerate it for 20 minutes to make it easier to handle. Preheat
the oven to 350 degrees, line baking pans with baking paper. Use a
#24 (2 tablespoon) scoop or a spoon to form the dough into balls.
Roll each ball into the remaining ground walnuts and place balls one
inch apart on the baking pans. Bake until lightly browned,
approximately 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the pans before
removing them.
