Title: Indiana Persimmon Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 batch
4 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Nutmeg
1 c  Chopped walnuts
1 c  Seedless raisins
1/2 c  Brandy
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
2 c  Persimmon pulp
1 c  Vegetable oil
4    Eggs
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Lightly grease and flour two 9x5" or three
8x4" loaf pans.

Put the raisins in the brandy and set aside.  Combine the sugars,
persimmon pulp and oil.  Add eggs, one at a time; beat well after
each addition. Sift together the dry ingredients into a medium bowl.
Add to the egg mixture and stir in the brandied raisins and nuts.

Pour into greased pans.  Bake for 1 hour, a bit longer for the 9"
pans. Be sure to test with a cake tester to make sure the bread is
done; you may have to adjust cooking time.

Yield: About 16 slices.
