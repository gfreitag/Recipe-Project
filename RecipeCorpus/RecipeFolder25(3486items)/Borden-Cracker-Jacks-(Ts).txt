Title: Borden Cracker Jacks (Ts)
Categories: Snack, Popcorn, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
2 T  Molasses
1/4 t  Salt
4 qt Popped popcorn
1 c  Spanish peanuts
4 T  Butter
1 c  Brown sugar
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Combine the popcorn and peanuts in a
metal bowl or on a cookie sheet and place in the preheated oven.
Combine all of the remaining ingredients in a saucepan. Stirring over
medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil.  Using a cooking
thermometer, bring the mixture to the hard-ball stage (260 degrees,
or the point at which the syrup, when dripped into cold water, forms
a hard but pliable ball.) This will take about 20 to 25 minutes (or
until you notice the mixture turning dark brown.) Remove the popcorn
and peanuts from the oven and, working quickly, pour the caramel
mixture in a fine stream over them. Then place them back in the oven
for 15 minutes. Mix well every five minutes, so that all of the
popcorn is coated. Cool and store in a covered container to preserve
freshness. Makes: 4 quarts From: "Top Secrets Recipes" Cookbook
