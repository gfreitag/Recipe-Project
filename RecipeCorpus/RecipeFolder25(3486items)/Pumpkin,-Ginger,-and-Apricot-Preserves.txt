Title: Pumpkin, Ginger, and Apricot Preserves
Categories: Can/preserv, Vegetable, Fruit, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 cups
-- peeled first
1    Cinnamon stick (3-inch)
2 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 lb Dried apricots
5 c  Fresh peeled, seeded pumpkin
-- (cut into 1/2 inch dice)
1 tb Fresh gingerrot, grated
In a bowl, let the apricots soak in 1-1/2 cups water, covered,
overnight. Drain the apricots, reserving the water, and cut them into
1/4-inch julienne strips.

In a large saucepan, combine the reserved water, the pumpkin, the
gingerroot, and the cinnamon stick, and bring to a boil over high
heat. Turn the heat down to simmer and cook the mixture, covered,
stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.  Discard the cinnamon stick.

In a food processor or blender, puree the pumpkin mixture with any of
its liquid and return it to the pan over moderate heat.  Add the
apricots and the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, turn
the heat down to simmer, and cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or
until it is thickened.

Spoon the preserves into hot, sterilized Mason-type canning jars,
filling the jars to withint 1/4 inch of the rims.  Wipe the rims with
a dampened cloth or paper towel and seal the jars with the sterilized
lids. Place the jars in a canning kettle or a deep steamer and add
enough water to cover the jars by 2 inches.  Bring the water to a
boil over high heat and boil the jars for 10 minutes.  With tongs,
transfer the jars to a dish towel to drain and cool.

NOTE: Don't throw away the pumpkin seeds. Spread them out on a cookie
sheet and dry them in a 350 F oven for about 30 minutes.  They're
delicious as nutritious snacks or to nibble with cocktails.
