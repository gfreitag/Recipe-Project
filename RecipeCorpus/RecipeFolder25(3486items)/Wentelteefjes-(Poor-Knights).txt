Title: Wentelteefjes (Poor Knights)
Categories: Dessert, Bread, European
Yield: 4 servings
2 oz Butter
2    Eggs
8 sl Stale bread
4 oz Sugar
10 fl Milk
Beat together the milk, eggs and the sugar in a soup plate. Melt a
nut of the butter in a frying pan. Soak one piece of the bread in the
egg and milk mixture and fry it golden in the butter turning once to
brown the other side. Continue until bread and batter are all used
up. Serve the poor knights immediately, sprinkled with more sugar.

SUGGESTIONS. Sprinkle the slices with cinnamon as well, or serve with
a spoonful of jam. Syrup - either golden or maple - is also delicious
with poor knights as are fresh strawberries and cream.
