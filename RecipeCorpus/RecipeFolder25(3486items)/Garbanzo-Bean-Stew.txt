Title: Garbanzo Bean Stew
Categories: Native amer, Beans, Beef, Game, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 sm Onion, chopped
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts White pepper
2 lb Dried garbanzo beans
10 c  Water
4 lb Stew beef or venison, cut
-into 1-inch cubes
Soak the garbanzo beans overnight in twice their volume of water.  The
beans will absorb much of the water and swell in size.  The following
day, drain and rinse the beans under cold running water.  Place the
beans in a large pot with the 10 cups of water.  Bring to a boil over
high heat, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, 1 1/2
hours, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the meat,
onions, salt, and pepper, stir well and continue cooking another 2
hours until the meat is tender and the beans are fully cooked.

Serve hot with one of the many Indian breads, for example, Indian
Tortillas, Adobe Bread, or Piki Bread. ***** Margaret Archuleta of
Picuris Pueblo taught me the recipe for this simple and satisfying
stew made with garbanzo beans.  I first tasted it while celebrating
New Year's Day with her family.
