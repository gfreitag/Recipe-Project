Title: Grantham Gingerbreads
Categories: British, Dessert, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 batch
2 1/4 c  Self-rising flour
2    To 3 tsp. ground ginger
1    Stick (1/2 cup) butter
1 1/2 c  Plus 3 tb. sugar
1    Egg; beaten
Grease two cookie sheets.  Heat oven to 350 F.

Cream the butter and sugar together.  Add the egg, beating well.  Add
flour and ginger gradually, beating until well-blended.  Form into
balls about the size of a walnut and place them well apart on greased
cookie tins.

Bake in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes.  (Kluger's note: On my
insulated cookie sheets, it took 40 minutes.)  The gingerbreads will
be pale in color and the tops will crack.  The insides will have
hollow places in them.

Yield: About 30.

Kluger writes: "I have changed the ounces and grams in the English
recipe to our regular measures and, again, adapted the hand-mixed
method to the electric mixer."
