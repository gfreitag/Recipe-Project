Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Vanilla
2 c  Flour
1 t  Baking soda
1 t  Cream of tartar
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Lightly packed brown sugar
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ea Egg

Coloured sugar, candied fruit or decorating candies for garnish Icing
Glaze (optional).  1 cup icing sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoon milk, food
coloring.  Cream the butter.  Add the brown sugar and sugar and beat
until light and fluffy.  Beat in the egg and then the vanilla.  Sift
together the flour, baking soda and cream of tarter. Gradually add
the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture, stirring only until
thoroughly mixed. Divide the dought into two, wrap each half in wax
paper and chill for 3 hours or longer. Preheat the oven to 375F. Roll
dough out to a thickness of 1/4" or less, working with a bit at a
time. Cut the cookies into the desired shaped and using a metal
spatula, place on baking sheets. Leave a space of about 1 1/2"
between the cookies for them to expand. Decorate as desired. (If you
wish to decorate with icing glaze, do so after the cookies have been
baked and cooled). Bake for 8 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool
flat on racks. Prepare the glaze if desired, and ice the cookies.
Store in an air-tight container. To make the icing glaze, combine the
icing sugar and milk in a small bowl. Stir until smooth. For a green
or pink glaze, add a few drops of food colouring and mix well. Spread
the glaze on the top of the cookies after they have been baked and
cooled. If you wish to garnish the glaze with coloured candies or
bits of cherries, do so immediately before the icing becomes too
hard. Yield 3 dozen cookies. From the book "Canadian Christmas
Cooking" by Rose Murray AR/92
