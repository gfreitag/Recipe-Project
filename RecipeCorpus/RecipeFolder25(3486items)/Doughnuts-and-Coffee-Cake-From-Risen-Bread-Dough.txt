Title: Doughnuts and Coffee Cake From Risen Bread Dough
Categories: Doughnut, Cake/cookie, Beverage
Yield: 1 servings  other delicacies.  When making a batch of bread, it is a simple
matter to remove 2 cups of the dough after the first rising, and work
other ingredients into it to make doughnuts or coffee cake. For
doughnuts, work into 2 cups once-risen bread dough 3 eggs 1/2 cup
melted butter 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 tsp. cinnamon or nutmeg approximately
2 cups flour, Or enough to make a dough that is soft, but workable.
Roll the dough out and cut with a floured doughnut cutter.  Let the
doughnuts rise until light and then deep-fry them. *** (I have other
recipes that call for brushing them with butter and baking them in
the oven.) Coffee Cake Using Risen Bread Dough: Into 2 cups of
once-risen dough work 3/4 cup sugar 1/3 cup soft butter. No extra
flour will be needed. Roll the dough to fit a 10 inch square pan.
Brush the top with butter and cover with a Streusel or simply with
sugar and cinnamon.  Let it rise and bake in a 350 oven for about 30
to 45 minutes.  One delicious variation is made by spreading the top
of the dough with apricot preserves and topping the preserves with a
meringue. Bake as directed. This is European and very, very good.
