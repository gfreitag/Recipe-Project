Title: Unleavened Griddle Baked Pita
Categories: Middle east, Bread
Yield: 12 pitas
1 c  Warm water
Vegetable oil
3 c  White flour
1 ts Salt
Combine flour & salt & add stir in enough water so that the dough
pulls away from the sides of the bowl & is no longer sticky.  Stir
till smooth. Knead on a board for 5 minutes.

Shape dough into rectangle & cut in half lengthwise.  Divide into 12
portions & shape into smooth balls.  Cover with damp balls & let rest
5 to 10 minutes.

Press each ball flat & roll into a 6" or 7" circle.  Cover with damp
towels.  Lightly oil a griddle or skillet.  Gently stretch each round
as thin as possible.  Cook until brown & bubbly spots appear on the
bottom, about 90 seconds.  Turn over & brown the other side.  Remove
from griddle & wrap immediately in towels.
