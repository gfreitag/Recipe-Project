Title: Beaumont Inn's Corn Pudding
Categories: Casserole, Vegetable, Holiday, Pudding, Side dish
Yield: 12 servings
3 c  Corn (two 11 oz. cans)
6    Eggs
6 c  Milk
3/4 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
6 tb Butter; melted
Combine flour, salt and sugar.  Mix it and the butter into corn.
Beat eggs well.  Pour into milk, then stir into corn mixture.  Pour
into a 3-quart greased casserole.

At this point, it may be refrigerated overnight or frozen for several
weeks.  (If you are freezing, use a dish that is both freezer and oven
safe.)

To serve, thaw and bake in a 400 F. oven 40 to 50 minutes, stirring
vigorously with a long-tined cooking fork 3 times about 10 minutes
apart.

(Additional baking time will be needed if the pudding is refrigerated
or frozen.  Pudding should be soft but set in center when done and
top should be golden.)

Colombo writes: "And from another Harrodsburg institution comes this
corn pudding recipe.  This was my first experience at freezing corn
pudding. It works like a charm.  My only advice is to place the
casserole on a cookie sheet before attempting to place it in the
freezer. The liquid sloshes around and spills over the sides."
