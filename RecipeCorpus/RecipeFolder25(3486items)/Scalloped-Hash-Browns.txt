Title: Scalloped Hash Browns
Categories: Potato, Microwave, Casserole, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 c  Sour cream
1/2 t  Salt
1/8 t  Pepper
1/2 c  Crushed cheese crackers
(serves 4 to 6)
1/4 c  Chopped green onion, tops
-included or 1 tablespoon
Freeze-dried chopped chives
1 T  Butter or margarine
3 c  Loose frozen hash browns
1 cn (10 3/4 oz.) cream of
-chicken soup
Place onion and butter in 8X8 inch dish.  Cover with wax paper.
Microwave at high 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until onion is tender. Stir
in remaining ingredients expect cracker crumbs. Cover with wax paper.
Microwave at high 8 to 9 minutes, or until cheese melts and potatoes
are tender, stiring 3 or 4 times during cooking. Sprinkle with
cracker crumbs. Microwave uncovered 2 minutes, or until thoroughly
heated. Now if you don't have a microwave you can still do this on
the stove for the onion (in a pot) and in the oven (I'd say about
325F) for the rest.
