ABOUT 40 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING:

1. In nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium high heat, cook pecans
until golden brown. Cool pecans slightly; coarsely chop.

2. In large bowl, combine buttermilk, oats, flour, baking soda, salt,
eggs, and 1 T confectioners' sugar and stir just until flour is
moistened; stir in toasted pecans.

3. Over medium heat, heat same skillet until hot; brush lightly with
oil. Pour batter by 1/4 cups into hot skillet, making 2 or 3 pancakes
at time. Cook until tops are bubbly and bubbles burst; edges will
look dry. With pancake turner, turn and cook until undersides are
golden; place on warm platter; keep warm. Repeat until all batter is
used, brushing skillet with more salad oil if necessary.

4. In small saucepan over medium heat, heat maple syrup until very
warm. In cup, mix cinnamon with 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar.
Sprinkle pancakes with cinnamon sugar; serve with warm maple syrup.
Garnish platter with fruit.

Sylvia's comments: this is a great pancake recipe, but let the batter
sit awhile before using and DON'T waste syrup on the cakes, just load
'em up with butter and brown sugar.  Complements the nutty taste
wonderfully, even though I didn't use the pecans.
