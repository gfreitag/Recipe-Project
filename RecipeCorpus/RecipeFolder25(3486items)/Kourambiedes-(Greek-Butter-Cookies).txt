Title: Kourambiedes (Greek Butter Cookies)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Greek
Yield: 36 servings
1 1/2 tb Cognac or brandy
4 1/2 c  Cake flour, sifted twice
1/2 lb Butter
3/4 c  Confectioner's sugar
1    Egg yolk
1.  Cream the butter in an electric mixer until thick and lemon
colored. Sift confectioner's sugar and add it gradually to the
butter. Add egg yolk, creaming well.  Add cognac.

2.  Gradually work in the flour to make a soft dough that will roll
easily in the palm of the hand without sticking.  If sticky,
refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.

3.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

4.  Pat and shape the dough into balls 1 1/2 inches in diameter.
Place on ungreased baking sheet and bake until sandy colored (not
brown), about 15 minutes.  Cool and sift over generously with
additional confectioner's sugar.

These crumbly cookies, coated with confectioner's sugar, are
traditionally served in Greek homes at all festive occasions.  At
weddngs they are served as a good luck token.
