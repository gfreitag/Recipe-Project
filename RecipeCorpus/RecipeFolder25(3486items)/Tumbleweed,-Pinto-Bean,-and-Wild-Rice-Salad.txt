Tumbleweed spreads quickly by tumbling across the sandy soil,
scattering seeds that catch and sprout in the depressions in the
soil. The new young shoots must be picked when they are two to three
inches tall, before they become dry and brittle and develop thornlike
prickers.

to harvest them yourself, pick the sprouts from the base of the stem.
Wash thoroughly until all the sand and dirt are removed.  Drain and
pat dry. *****

Soak the beans overnight in water to cover.  In the morning, drain the
beans, rinse them under cold running water, and place them in a
saucepan with fresh water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat,
then reduce the heat and simmer several hours until the beans are
soft and the skins begin to split.  Add water when necessary to keep
the beans from drying, and stir occasionally to prevent them from
burning and sticking. Remove from the heat, drain, and allow to cool.

In a bowl, toss together the greens, beans and rice.  Cover and chill
in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes.  In a blender, combine the
oil, vinegar, chives, garlic, pepper, and salt.  Blend at high speed
until the chives and garlic are finely pureed.

Pour the dressing over the salad, toss, and garnish with chive
blossoms.
