1 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Light Corn Syrup
2/3 c  Water
2 ea Tb Butter or Margarine
Butter baking pan 8 x 8 x 2 inches.  Heat sugar, corn syrup. water,
butter, cornstarch and salt to boiling in 2-quart saucepan over
medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook without stirring, until candy
thermometer registers 256 degrees (or until a small amount of mixture
dropped into very cold water forms a hard ball), about 20 minutes.
Remove frm heat; stir in vanilla, almond extract, almonds and food
color. Pour into pan. Let stand until cool enough to handle, 15 to20
minutes.  (Taffy should be lukewarm in center as well as at the
edges.) At this point, your guests can fold, double and pull the
taffy until it is light in color and stiff. Have them butter their
hands lightly if taffy starts to stick (see note). Cut tffy into
pieces with scissors. gueests can help wrap the pieces with plactic
wrap. (Taffy will lose its shape ifnot wrapped.) Makes about 1 pound
of taffy. NOTE: If taffy becomes too stiff to pull, reheat in a 350
degree oven 3 to 5 minutes. DAFFY TAFFY: Omit almond extract, almonds
and food color. Immediately after removing from heat, stir in the
vanilla and 1 package (6 ounce) semisweet chocolate or butter-scotch
chips. Pour into pan; cool. Cut into 1 inch squares. shape the candy
into rolls, decorate with nuts or wrap the squares around miniature
marshmallows. Recipe from Betty Crocker's Step by Step Recipes.
