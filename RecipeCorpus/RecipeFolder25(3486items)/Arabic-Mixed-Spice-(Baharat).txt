Title: Arabic Mixed Spice (Baharat)
Categories: Middle east, Mixes, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
2 ts Grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
2 tb Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Ground coriander
1 tb Ground cloves
2 tb Ground cumin
Put all into a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake. This makes
about 1/2 cup and will keep for about 1 year. A great all-purpose
spice mixture!
