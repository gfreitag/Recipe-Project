2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
2 tb Lemon or orange juice
1/2 c  Buttermilk, sour milk
-- or yogurt
1/2 c  Pecans, walnuts or peanuts

Chips for garnish
-(about 1/2 cup)

2 tb Bran*
2 tb Powdered milk*
1/2 c  Cornmeal

1/4 c  Butter or vegetable oil
1/2 c  Honey or maple syrup
Full of good B vitamins that help you keep your cool, these
lemon-flavored cornmeal pecan cookies perk up the lunchbox and are a
delicious after-school snack.  Make a big batch--they freeze well.

* You can substitute 1/2 cup Dynamite Mix for all these ingredients
Preheat oven to 325F.

Stir together all the dry ingredients in a bowl.  In food processor,
blender, or mixing bowl, beat the butter and honey together, then add
the egg, lemon zest, juice, and buttermilk and process until smooth
and creamy. Add the dry ingredients and mix briefly until
incorporated. (If you are using and electric mixer rather than a food
processor, follow the same procedure, except that you would add the
buttermilk alternately with the mixture of dry ingredients.) Stir in
the chopped nuts.

Drop the batter by teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet 2
inches apart, to allow for spreading.  Garnish with nuts or carob
chips. Bake for about 12 minutes.  Watch the cookies carefully, as
they burn easily. Remove to a wire rack to cool.
