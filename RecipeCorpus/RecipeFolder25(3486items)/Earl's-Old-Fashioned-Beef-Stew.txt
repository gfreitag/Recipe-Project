Title: Earl's Old-Fashioned Beef Stew
Categories: Meat, Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 c  Celery, cut into sml. pieces
4    Carrots, 1 inch slices
1    Green pepper, thin strips
3    Med. potatoes, peeled cubed
2    Beef bouillon cubes
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 lb Beef chuck, cut into cubes
2 tb Cooking oil
6 c  Boiling water
1 cl Garlic
1    Medium onion, diced
1    Or 2 bay leaves
Mix flour, salt and pepper.

Coat the meat with flour mixture and brown meat thoroughly in the
cooking oil in a large skillet.

Transfer the browned meat to a 2 qt saucepan. Add water, heat to
boiling.

Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 2 hours.

Stir in remaining ingredients. Simmer for 30 minutes more or until
vegetables are tender.

To thicken stew, in a small jar, shake 1 cup cold water and 3 tbs
flour until blended.  Stir into stew; heat to boiling, stirring
constantly. Boil and stir for 1 minute.

To make Oxtail stew, substitute 4 lbs oxtails for the stew meat and
cook for 3 1/2 hours instead of the 2 called for in beef stew.

I start my stew right after breakfast and let it simmer all day,
adding vegetables about an hour before I plan to eat. Like most soups
and stews, it is better when heated the second or third day. - Earl
