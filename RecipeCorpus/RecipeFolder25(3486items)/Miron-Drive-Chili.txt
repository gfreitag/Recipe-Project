Heat olive oil in a heavy pot.  Add pork and beef (I used all beef),
breaking up any large pieces, cook until meat is done. Add onion,
green pepper, celery, garlic, oregano, bay leaves, cumin (I left out)
and chili powder.  Stir to blend well.  Add tomatoes, brother, water,
salt & pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.
Add beans and cook another 10 min.  Remove and discard bay leaves.
Yield: 8-10 servings. SErve in hot bowls with a garnish of sour cream
or lime wedges.
NOTE:  To cook dry beans; pick over 1/2 pound of dry beans, removing
any broken ones or small stones, etc.; place in a pot with 5 cups of
hot water; bring to a boil and cook 3 minutes; remove from heat,
cover and let stand at least 1 hr., preferably 4 hrs., or more;
discard the water, rinse beans, and return to the pot with hot water
to cover by 1"; add bacon drippings, bacon or ham, and other desired
seasonings; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until beans are
just tender, adding HOT water as needed to keep beans just covered
with liquid; add salt to taste when almost done. DO NOT OVERCOOK as
beans will be cooked for another 10 min. in the chili. This is one of
CHUCK OZBURN'S recipes from *P. Paul made it (quadupled recipe) for
Riverton Mexican Fiesta!  It was tremendous. We used canned beans.
