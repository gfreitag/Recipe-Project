The acidity of different varieties of tomatoes varies greatly,
therefore the United States Department of Agriculture now recommends
adding bottledlemon juice to assure a safe product.  "The addition of
two tablespoons per quart or one tablespoon per pint of bottled lemon
juice is an important safeguard, but it doesn't eliminate the need
for following other safe canning procedures as well," said Sylvia
Treitman, home economist for the Michigan State University Extension
~ Oakland County. Processing times for canning omatoes need to be
followed carefully, advises Sylvia.  If you haven't canned for
several years, it is advised that you get updated canning
information. Origin: The Observer (Michigan paper) September 12,
