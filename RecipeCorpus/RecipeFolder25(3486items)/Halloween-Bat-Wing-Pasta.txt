Joyce Steins, who is the owner of Le Bar Bat and Cafe Iguana in New
York City, appeared on "Live" at Halloween with her solution to
'treat overdose' - give the kids a hearty and helathy dinner they
love that will fill them up enough to delay a candy binge. As
honorary Bat Lady of the day, Joyce said the peanut butter and to
bowtie shaped pasta in this recipe are the key ingredients that give
you the edge in tempting your little ghosts and goblins. 3 tbsp plus
1 tsp vegetable oil 3/4 lb uncooked chicken, diced salt and pepper to
taste 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 3/4 cup chicken broth 1 tsp
granulated sugar 1 cup peanut butter 1/4 cup sesame paste 2 tsp soy
sauce 1 lb bowtie pasta, cooked and drained 1/2 cucumber, peeled and
chopped 1/2 cup plain peanuts, chopped 2 scallions, finely chopped In
a large saucepan, heat 3 tbsp of the oil over medium high heat.  Cook
the chicken for 3-5 minutes, or until no longer pink, stirring
frequently. Season with salt and pepper.  In another saucepan, heat
the remaining teaspoon of oil over medium high heat.  Cook the garlic
for about 1 minute, or until lightly golden, stirring constantly.
Add the chicken broth and the sugar and bring to a boil.  Gradually
add the peanut butter, stirring constatnly until the mixture is
smooth and creamy. Stir in the sesame paste and soy sauce until
smooth.  Add the peanut butter sauce to the chicken and simmer for
about 5 mintues. Mixin the pasta "bat wings" and toss to coat.
