Categories: Snack, Cake/cookie, Kids, Chocolate
Yield: 48 cookies
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
Pecan halves
Assorted candy*
1    6-oz package semisweet
-chocolate pieces (1 c)
6 tb Butter or margarine
1/3 c  Shortening
2/3 c  Packed brown sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
*Candies that work best are 1/2-inch pieces of chocolate-covered
nougat bars with peanuts or caramel, candy-coated milk
chocolate-covered peanuts, and chocolate-coated caramel candies. In a
large mixer bowl beat butter or margarine and shortening with
electric mixer on medium speed 30 seconds. Add brown sugar and beat
till fluffy.

Add egg and vanilla.  Beat well.

Stir together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  Gradually
add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating well.  Cover and chill
in the refrigerator about 1 hour or till firm enough to handle.

Turn oven to 325F.  Follow directions for shaping turtles.*

Bake in the 325F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  Let cool on cookie
sheets 1 minute.  With a pancake turner lift cookies onto a cooling
rack to finish cooling.

In small saucepan melt chocolate pieces over low heat.  Spread atop
cookies.  Store in refrigerator.

*Shape the dough into 1-inch balls.  Press a piece of candy into each
ball and mold the dough around it.  For feet, arrange on ungreased
cookie sheets groups of 4 pecan halves so their ends touch.  Space
groups 2 inches apart. Put a ball of candy-stuffed dough atop each
group of pecan halves.
