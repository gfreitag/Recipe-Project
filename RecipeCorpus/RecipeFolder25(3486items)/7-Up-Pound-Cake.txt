MMMMM----------------YIELD: 6 SERVINGS (GUESSTIMA---------------------
3 c  Flour
2 T  Lemon extract
1 c  7-Up; room temp
1 c  Margarine
1/2 c  Shortening
3 c  Sugar
5 lg Eggs
Cream the margarine, shortening and sugar together beating until
light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, blending well after
each addition. Beat in the flour, then beat in the extract and 7-Up.
Blend well. Pour the batter into a well-greased and floured tube pan
and bake at 325 degrees F for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. This is an old recipe
that comes from a request in the local paper for "Classic Recipes".
They called the 7-Up bottling company and they did not even know
about it. Someone developed this on their own and never let the
company know about it. BTW 7-Up comes from the popular card game in
the 1930's. From The Rocky Mountain News "Food Fare" Section
