MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 c  Raisins
1 c  Chopped nuts
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
1    Egg
1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Persimmon pulp
2 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Milk
2 c  Powdered sugar
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Brown sugar
Cream butter and sugar.  Add egg.  Dissolve soda in persimmon pulp
and add to butter.  Mix well.  Add dry ingredients, raisins and nuts.

Drop by spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet and bake at 350 F.
about 10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Frost with caramel
frosting.

To make frosting, melt butter in a medium-sized heavy pan.  Add brown
sugar and cook 2 minutes.  Add milk and bring to a boil.  Remove from
heat and add powdered sugar.  Ice cooled cookies quickly to get a
glossy coating; the icing will set up as it cools.
