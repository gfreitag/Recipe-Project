Yield: 1 batch
Salt; to taste
2    Chopped onions
1 c  Sliced carrots
3 tb Butter
2 tb Curry powder
1/2 ts Paprika
1 lb Dried lima beans
-- soaked overnight
4    Whole cloves
4    Whole peppercorns
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Chile powder
Cook beans in water to cover with cloves, peppercorns, bay, chile
powder, salt, onions and carrots.  Cook until tender, about 1 1/2
hours.

In a small skillet, melt butter.  Add curry powder and paprika, and
stir for a minute to develop the flavors.  Add to soup and simmer
together for a few minutes before serving.

Marston writes: "This is an easy and tasty soup for fall.  I've had
the recipe for years, but have gradually changed it to suit my
family's taste. When I'm feeling ambitious, I make my own curry
powder using 1 teaspoon each of ground cumin and ground coriander,
1/2 teaspoon each of ground ginger and fennel seed, and 1 tablespoon
of turmeric."
