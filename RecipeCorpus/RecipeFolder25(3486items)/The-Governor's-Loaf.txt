all of the ingredeints except the cheese and the olives in a large
bowl. "Squish" the ingredients together with your hands and pat the
mixtuer into the prepared pan.  Bake for 60-75 minutes, or until
completely cooked. Top the loaf with the cheese and olive slices is
desired. Return the meatloaf to the oven and bake for 1-2 minutes
longer, or until the cheese is melted. Origin: Cooking with Regis and
