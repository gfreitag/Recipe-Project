Categories: Candy, Holiday, Dessert, Chocolate
Yield: 1 batch
1 1/2 tb Cognac vanilla
1    To 1 1/4 lbs. imported
-semisweet choc. coating
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 lb Imported semisweet choc.
-- chopped into pieces
1 1/2 tb Pure vanilla or
Heat the cream with the broken pieces of chocolate over simmering
water. Whisk until smooth, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.
When cool, stir in vanilla.  Cover and refrigate until the ganache is
very thick, about 5 hours or overnight.

Roll into small balls and place on a foil or wax paper-lined pastry
sheet. Freeze for several hours or overnight.

Melt the chocolate coating, but do not let it get hotter than 90 F.
Dip each truffle, one at a time, into the coating, turning it to coat
it well. Gently lift each truffle with a fork and hold it above the
pan for a few seconds to let the excess chocolate drip back into the
pan. Gently scrape bottom of fork against edge of pan to remove more
of the excess chocolate; this prevents the chocolate from forming
platforms under the candy pieces.

Using the flat side of knife or spatula, very gently slide truffle
off fork onto a foil or wax paper-lined pastry sheet. Store in the
refrigerator. Cover lightly when firm.

Yield: About 36 truffles, depending upon the size of the ganache
balls.

Variations: For chocolate Grand Marnier, cognac or Cointreau ganache
truffles, make the truffles as in the vanilla truffles but add 2 to 3
tb. of Grand Marnier, cognac or Cointreau to the cooled ganache
mixture instead of the vanilla.
