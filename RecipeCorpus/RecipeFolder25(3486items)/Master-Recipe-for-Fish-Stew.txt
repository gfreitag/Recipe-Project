1. Mix base and fish stock; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and
adjust seasonings with salt, pepper and cayenne to taste.

2. Add firmer fish pieces; simmer for 2 minutes. Add smaller, more
delicate fish; simmer, stirring gently to ensure even cooking, until
fish is almost cooked through, about 3 minutes longer. Remove kettle
from heat; cover and let stand until fish is just cooked, about 5
minutes. Fish is done when it feels firm and springs back to the
touch. Do not cook until the fish flakes. Put soup in a tureen or
ladle into individual bowls. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
