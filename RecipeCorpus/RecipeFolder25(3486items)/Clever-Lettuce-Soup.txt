The Clever Cleaver Brothers (two macho-looking chefs) always dress in
unique costumes and introduce their segments with rap lyrics.  They
really aren't borthers, but they sure are clever!  This flavorful and
low calorie soup recipe is one of their many inspired creations. 1/2
head iceberg lettuce, cut into 1 inch pieces (about 4 cups) 1/2 head
romaine lettuce, cut into 1 inch pieces (about 4 cups) 1 medium
spansih onion, chopped 3 cups chicken broth, divided 1 tsp curry
powder 1/4 to 1/2 tsp coarsely ground black pepper 1/8 tsp low sodium
worcestershire sauce

In a large saucepan, combine the lettuces, onion, and 2-3/4 cups of
the chicken broth. In a msall bowl, stir together the remaining 1/4
cup of broth, curry powder, pepper, and worcestershire sauce.  Stir
the curry powder mixture into the lettuce mixture.  Heat the soup
over medium high heat until it comes to a boil.  REduce the heat to
low and simmer for 15 minutes.  In a blender or a food processor
fitted with the metal chopping blade, process the soup until it is
almost smooth, but still has some texture.  If using a blender,
process the soup in small batches. Reheat if necessary and serve
immediately.  Makes 4 servings. Origin: Cooking with Regis & Kathy
