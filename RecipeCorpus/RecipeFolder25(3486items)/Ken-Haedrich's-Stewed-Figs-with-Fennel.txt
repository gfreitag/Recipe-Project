Title: Ken Haedrich's Stewed Figs with Fennel
Categories: Breakfast, Fruit, Side dish
Yield: 1 batch
1    Long wide (abt. 3") strip of
-lemon zest
1/2 ts Fennel seeds, crushed, plus
A few whole seeds to garnish
2 c  ;Water
1/3 c  Honey
1/4 c  Ruby port wine
3/4 lb Dried figs
Heat the water, honey and port in a medium-sized, nonreactive (not
cast iron or aluminum) saucepan.  Remove stems from the figs.  Cut
the figs in half lengthwise, then stir them into the liquid along
with lemon zest and fennel seeds.  Bring to a boil over medium heat,
then lower heat and simmer about 20 minutes, partially covered.  Stir
them occasionally, but do it gently so you don't push the soft seedy
centers out of the figs; this is unavoidable to some extent, but you
don't want to overdo it.

Remove fig mixture from the heat, then transfer contents of the pan
to a bowl.  Cool to room temperature, cover and refrigerate overnight
before serving.  Serve individual portions with a few whole fennel
seeds sprinkled on top.

Yield: 4 or 5 servings.
