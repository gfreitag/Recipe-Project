4 tb Flour
1 cn Tomato sauce (large can)
1/4 c  Red wine
1 lb Hamburger meat
6 x  Dried chili pods
1/2 c  Warm water
1 tb Oregano
1 ts Cumin
Hint: to test chili pod's heat, take a small nibble of dry chili in
your mouth, when cooked, it will about double in strenght. Brown
hamburger meat in large skillet. While browning, make chili paste.
Take 6-8 dried chili pods, remove some seeds, leave some in for
flavor. Remove stems. Put in blender with about 1/2 cup warm water or
so just enough to make a paste. Too wet will be difficult. When
hamburger meat is browned, drain fat. Add chili paste, oregano, cumin
and garlic cloves. Add salt to taste. Brown mixture well, Don't
burn!Add 4 tablespoons of flour. Brown this, immediately remove from
heat. In another large saucepan, add tomato sauce and red wine. Add
browned mixture. Simmer, simmer, simmer for (3 hours or more) you can
do this in s slow cooker. Thin if necessary, salt to taste, adjust
cumin and oregano as needed, thse flavors strenghten with cooking
(cumin tends to add a sweet hint of taste.) Salt enhances all flavors
Hint: buy more tomato sauce than you need, if chili is TOO hot when
done, add more tomato sauce. Serve with sour cream, grated mild
cheedar cheese or whatever you like. Hint: drink iced tea with chili,
it's the best beverage for hot mouth! Enjoy the lovely aroma in your
kitchen.
