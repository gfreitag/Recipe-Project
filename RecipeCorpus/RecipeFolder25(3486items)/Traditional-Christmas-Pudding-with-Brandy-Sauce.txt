Title: Traditional Christmas Pudding with Brandy Sauce
Categories: Dessert, Pudding, Holiday
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 1/2 ts Mixed spice
8 oz Brown sugar
4 oz Wholewheat breadcrumbs
8 oz Vegetable suet
1 ea Lemon, juice & rind
1 tb Molasses
5 tb Water & rum mixed
8 oz Currants
4 oz Sultanas
4 oz Raisins
4 oz Chopped candied peel
1 oz Skinned & chopped almonds
4 oz Wholewheat flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
Grease a 2 pint pudding basin & use a large saucepan to hold the
basin.

Wash currants, sultanas & raisins in warm water & pat dry.  Put fruit
in large bowl with candied peel & almonds.  Sift flour, salt & spices
into bowl & add sugar, breadcrumbs & suet.  Mix well then stir in
lemon juice, rind & molasses with enough of the water & rum mixture
to make a soft mixture.  Turn into the basin, cover with waxed paper
& aluminum foil & put basin into pot.  Pour enough water into the pot
to reach halfway up the side of the basin.  Bring to a boil, cover
saucepan & let pudding steam gently for 4 hours, watching the water
level & topping up with boiling water if necessary.

When cooked, cool the pudding & store in a cool dry place for up to 2
months.  Before serving, steam pudding agin for 3 hours.  Turn out
onto a serving platter & flame with brandy if you desire.

**NOTE I divide the pudding in half & make 2 smaller puddings.  Keeps
up to 3 months in the fridge.
