Heat the oil or melt the lard in a large heavy casserole over medium

and set aside. Add more oil or lard to the casserole if needed, then
add the onions and garlic and cook until the onions are translucent.

flour (masa harina) and cook 1 or 2 minutes longer. Return the
brisket to the casserole and add the tomatoes and their liquid. Bring
to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours.
Stir occasionally. Stir in the salt and black pepper. Taste and
adjust seasonings. Add the coffee and simmer, uncovered, for 1-1/2
hours longer.
