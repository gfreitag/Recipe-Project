Measure dry ingredients into a very large bowl that can be covered.
Add liquid ingredients.  Will keep for 6 weeks, if it lasts that
long. Fill muffin cups 1/2 full and bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes.

NOTE: The dry mixture may be stored and mixed as needed.  Mix at a
ratio of 3 cups mix to 1 cup buttermilk or sour milk, 1/4 cup oil,
and 1 egg. Reconstituted buttermilk powder may be used to replace
milk. Submitted By HELEN PEAGRAM   On   10-16-94
