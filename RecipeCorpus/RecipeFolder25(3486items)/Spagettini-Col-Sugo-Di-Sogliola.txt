Title: Spagettini Col Sugo Di Sogliola
Categories: Pasta, Seafood, Italian, Fish
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Canned Italian peeled plum
-tomatoes cut up, with
-their juice
Salt
1 lb Fresh fillet of sole
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Onion chopped fine
2 t  Garlic chopped fine
3 T  Chopped parsley
Hot red pepper to taste, cut into thin rings 1 pound spaghettini Wash
the Fish under cold running water and pat it thoroughly dry with
kitchen towels.  Cut it into strips about 3 inches long and 1-1/2
inches wide and set aside. Put the oil and onion in a medium size
skillet or saute pan and turn on the heat to high. When the onion
becomes colored a pale gold, add the chopped garlic. Cook only until
the garlic becomes translucent, then add the parsley. Stir 2 or 3
times, then add the cut up tomatoes, with their juice, a liberal
sprinkling of salt and the hot pepper. Lower the heat to medium,
cover the pan, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring from time to
time. If after 10 minutes the tomatoes are still watery, uncover the
pan, raise the heat and evaporate excess liquid. Drop the pasta into
a pot of abundant boiling salted water. Add the fish to the tomatoes,
and leaving the pan uncovered, turn the strips of sole over
frequently and gently, cooking them no more than 2 minutes, assuming
the pasta is nearly done.  The fish is done when its raw translucent
color changes to dull white.  If you are cooking the pasta later and
the sauce will need to be reheated, either hold back the fish
entirely until you reheat the sauce or cook it for just 1 minute the
first time. When the pasta is tender, but still firm to the bite,
drain immediately and toss at once with the sauce. Serve promptly,
without cheese.  For 4 to 6 persons. From: Asbury Park Press 9/28/94
