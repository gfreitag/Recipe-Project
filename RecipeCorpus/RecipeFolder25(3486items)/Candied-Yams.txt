Title: Candied Yams
Categories: Vegetable, Holiday, Side dish, Syrup, Sweetpotato
Yield: 1 servings
One stick butter or
-margarine
3-4 lbs. yams
One bottle DARK corn syrup
One bag mini marshmallows
Cook yams in boiling water for about 30-45 minutes, just until you can
pierce them with a fork. Cool and peel, then slice about 1/2 inch
thick. put a layer of yams in a 2 qt. casserole dish, dot with
butter, sprinkle some marshmallows over yam, then pour some corn
syrup over marshmallows continue layer in this manner until you use
up all the yams. ending with corn syrup. Bake along with your turkey
or bake seperate. The longer they cook the better they taste. If you
cook seperate bake at 325 for 2-3 hours. I hope you like these. They
are delicious. Posted by: Joan Madden (RHSV61B) - Prodigy Reposted
