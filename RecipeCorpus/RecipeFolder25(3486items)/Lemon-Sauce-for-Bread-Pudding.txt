Title: Lemon Sauce for Bread Pudding
Categories: Dessert, Cajun/creol, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 cup
Pinch of salt
4 tb Butter, cut into pieces
1 1/2 tb Fresh lemon juice*
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg yolk (white spot removed
1 1/2 ts Cornstarch
Half-fill the lower half of a double boiler with water and bring to a
boil. Meanwhile, cream together sugar and egg yolk (in a food
processor, or beating in a bowl with a wooden spoon).  Add cornstarch
and salt and blend well.  Add 1-1/4 cups water a little at a time,
blending after each addition, until all water is absorbed.

Pour mixture into the upper half of the double boiler and stir
constantly and strongly over low to medium heat, scraping the bottom
of the pot, until mixture begins to thicken.  (If egg starts to
scramble, remove the top half of the double boiler for a moment and
stir fiercely to cool the mixture, then return it to reduced heat).
Add the butter and lemon juice and continue stirring until butter
melts and mixture is creamy (about 10 minutes more).  If there are
any lumps, force sauce through a strainer. Serve hot or warm.

* Hard Sauce:  Substitute 1/4 cup brandy, whiskey, or rum for the
lemon juice.
