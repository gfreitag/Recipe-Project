Title: Corn Rice Bread
Categories: Bread, Nuts/grains, Rice
Yield: 2 loaf
Brown rice
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Water (or more)
2 c  Cornmeal
4 c  Whole wheat bread flour
2 tb Corn or sesame oil
3 c  To 4 cups cooled, cooked
MMMMM--------------------VARIATION (OPTIONAL-------------------------
1 tb Sunflower seeds
1 tb Sesame seeds
Or
Mix the cornmeal and flour and rub the oil in with your fingers.  Mix
in the rice, working it until the grains are all separate.  Add the
salt and enough water to make a pliable, kneadable dough; how much
water you need will depend on the wetness of the rice; if you rice is
on the chewy side, you may want as much as 3 cups.  Knead the sticky
dough until elastic, about 15 minutes.

The bread can be shaped at once and baked, but it is at its best (and
lightest) if you let it stand, covered 12 - 16 hours at cool room
temperature, then shape into two round hearth loaves and put them on a
cornmeal dusted baking sheet.  Place in a cold oven; turn to 350 F
and bake about an hour.

Cool completely before slicing, and slice very thin.

As you might expect from the modest salt measure, the bread's flavor
is subtle; but before you increase the salt, try it as is, sliced
very thin.
