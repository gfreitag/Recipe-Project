Title: Halloween Cheese Eyeballs
Categories: Holiday, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
MMMMM-------------------FROM:  SHELLEY RODGERS------------------------
1/2 lb (2 cups) Cheddar cheese,
-grated
1/2 c  Margarine (1 stick)
1/2 t  Salt
1 t  Paprika
1 c  Flour
6 oz Bottle stuffed green olives
-(small size = 8 oz = 63
-olives!)
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Shred cheese in work bowl
-of food processor, then
-place metal
Chopping blade in work bowl
-and add margarine.
Combine salt, paprika, and
-flour in separate bowl.
I was out of town for a few
-days and came up with a
-great gift
For my daughter, the book
-"Food Wizardry for Kids."
-We
Tried the recipe for Cheese
-Eyeballs today ++ a fairly
Appropriate recipe a few
-days before Halloween!
-This recipe
Works well with kids
-because all ingredients go
-into the
Food processor, and then
-the child can "roll up"
-the eyeballs
Just like playing with clay.
Turn on food processor, and slowly add flour mixture through the feed
tube. Stop processing as soon as ingredients are combined. Measure
approximately one teaspoon of this mixture and form an "eyeball"
around an olive. Turn the olive in the "eyeball" so that it is
"staring" outward. This recipe will yield about 24 "eyeballs". Line
up the eyeballs on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake in the oven for
approximately 15 minutes. If you want to make these ahead of time,
freeze them UNBAKED on the cookie sheet and transfer to a plastic bag
when frozen. Then just thaw and bake when needed.
