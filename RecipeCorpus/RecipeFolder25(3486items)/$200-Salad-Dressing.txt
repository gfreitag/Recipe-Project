NOTES:  Mr. and Mrs. Robbins were taking a motor trip last year
through the South.  At one of the Southern hotels they were served a
salad dressing which more than delighted their tastes.  Asking if
they might have the recipe, they were told to leave their name and
their address and it would be mailed to them.  On their return, they
found the recipe with a bill for $200.00.  Aghast, they consulted
their lawyer and were told that inasmuch as they had ordered with-
out asking the price, they would have to pay. Feeling that so costly
a recipe should be shared with many, Mrs. Robbins had copies made and
sent to her friends.  Try it and we think you'll smack your lips.
