Title: Lora Brody's Crackers
Categories: Bread
Yield: 1 batch
1 c  ;Water*
1/3 c  Seasonings and seeds**
3 c  Flour (at least 1 c. white)
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Olive oil
*Plus enough extra water to make a firm, smooth ball after 5 minutes
of mixing.

**Your choice of caraway, fennel, cumin, dill, sesame and poppy seeds,
kosher salt, coarse pepper, herbs de Provence, etc.).

Combine the flour, salt, olive oil and water in the bread machine;
let it mix until well-combined, at least 5 minutes.  If you've used a
lot of whole-grain flour, you may need to add water, so keep an eye
on it as it mixes.

Spread the seed-seasoning mixture on the counter.  Put the dough on
top of it and work the seasonings into the dough by kneading and
pressing. There will be some seeds left over but work at getting a
lot into the dough.

Cut the dough in half and roll as thinly as possible on the back of a
jellyroll pan.  Don't worry if it rips.  Use a pizza wheel (easiest)
or a thin knife to cut it into cracker shapes.  Bake 5 minutes.  The
outside crackers will be finished.  Remove them with tongs, then
finish cooking the others.  They should be light brown.  Serve them
immediately.

Yield: 30 to 50 crackers.

Note: If you don't have a bread machine, this recipe can be mixed in
your food processor.
