How can I tell if an unopened egg is raw or cooked? Spin the egg on
its side on a flat surface. If your egg rotates smoothly, with
effortless grace, it is hard-cooked.  If your egg wobbles noticeably,
it is uncooked. The wobbling occurs because centrifugal force
continuously changes the raw yolk's position inside the egg and so
keeps altering the egg's center of gravity. How to tell if an egg is
fresh:

Place the suspect egg in at least several inches of water in a bowl
or pot. If your egg sinks and lies on its's side, you have a fresh
egg. If it sinks but stands partially or fully erect on its tapered
end, your egg is over the hill, though technically still edible.  If
it floats, you are looking at a rotten egg, more suitable for a
garbage heap than a stomach. An egg acquires buoyancy as it ages
because, while it's yolk and albumen (egg white) are gradually losing
moisture to the outside world through the porous shell, the size of
it's air pocket is increasing. Why should eggs be stored upright?
Upright, in egg storing terminology, means with the larger end up
(tapered end down. Upright storage helps retard spoilage because it
maximizes the distance between the yolk and the egg's natural air
pocket. That gaseous space is potentially the egg's most prolific
breeding environment for airborne pathogenic bacteria, and the yolk
is more perishable than the albumen (egg white).  It stands to
reason, therefore, that you must keep the yolk as far away as
possible from the air pocket. When the large end is down the air
pocket arches upward (as doesn't any air bubble rising through a
liquid). From: Kitchen Science Shared By: Pat Stockett
