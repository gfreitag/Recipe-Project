First, make a batter. To do this take the starter from the fridge,
let it sit out to reach room temperature. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of
starter into a 2 quart bowl. Return the remaining starter to the
fridge. Add 1 1/2 cups of flour and about a cup of warm water and mix
well. You want to add just enough water to make the batter the
consistency of light pancake batter. Cover the bowl lightly to
prevent drying and let batter proof for 8-12 hours. When properly
proofed the surface will appear bubbly and it will exhibit a strong
pungent sour odor. (It NEVER takes mine this long to get to this
stage++starters must vary wildly here!). After proofing, measure out
the amount called for in the recipe and return the remaining batter
to the starter pot. Stir and refrigerate. Zoji Sour Dough Bread 1 cup
proofed batter 1/2 cup water (add more as needed) 1 tablespoon sugar
1 tsp salt 3 cups bread flour 2 tsp. dry yeast Put in bread pan and
press "Start"!

For variety you can add about 1/3 cup of sunflower seeds OR 2
Tablespoons of pesto or a few pine nuts. After pouring the batter
back into the start I always leave the residue in my big glass pyrex
bowl to dry. After a few days I scrape it off the sides with a spoon
and mash the "crumbs" in a mortar. Now you have a dry backup of your
starter to use in emergencies or to give to friends. Posted by: Linda
