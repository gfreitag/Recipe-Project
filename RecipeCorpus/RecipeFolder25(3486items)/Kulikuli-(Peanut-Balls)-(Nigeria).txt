Categories: Appetizer, African, Nuts/grains, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Cayenne
1 ts Salt
Oil for frying
1 lb Roasted peanuts
1/4 c  Peanut oil, or to taste
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
Grind or pound the nuts adding just enough oil to make a smooth
paste. With wet hands, squeeze the mixture to remove any excess oil.
Saute the onions, cayenne & salt in a tablespoon of oil until golden.
Knead into the nut paste.  Shape into 1" diameter balls adding a few

balls into hot oil or flatten & fry in a skillet.  Cook for 2 to 3
minutes until the outsides are crisp.
