3 tb Honey
1 lg Egg

All ingredients should be at room temperature, unless otherwise
noted. Add ingredients in the order specified in your bread machine
owners manual. Set bread machine on normal baking cycle, except
Panasonic/National models, which should be set on light. (I used
light crust setting)

Hint If dough appears too dry after kneading for the first couple of
minutes, add water no more than one tablespoon at a time, just until
dough appears elastic.  Do not add too much water.

Personal Note - with my Hitachi this recipe produced a dough much too
wet. I ended up adding four more tablespoons of flour during the
kneading cycle. This was for the large loaf.  Next time I cut back on
water.

I also always add one tablespoon of gluten to any bread recipe that I
use.

To get the liquids at room temperature I will microwave the
water/butter for a minute, then stir in the egg and pour into the
bread pan. The coolness of the bread pan brings down the water
temperature to be just right for my machine.

This recipe produced a very tall fluffy loaf that was about to touch
the dome of my machine before starting the baking cycle.  To avoid a
complete disaster I poked several holes in the top of the loaf with a
toothpick before the machine started the baking cycle.
