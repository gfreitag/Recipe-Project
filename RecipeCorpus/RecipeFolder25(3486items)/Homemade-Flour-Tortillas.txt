Title: Homemade Flour Tortillas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Oil
2 1/4 c  Hot water
5 c  Flour
3 t  Baking powder
2 t  Salt
Preheat a griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat. In a large bowl,
mix together the flour, baking powder, salt and oil. Work this
mixture for about 1 minute. Add the hot water, a little at a time,
until a soft dough is formed. Dough should be firm and elastic; if
it's sticky, add a little more flour. Cover and let rest for 5
minutes. Form dough into flat, thick balls approximately 2 1/2 inches
in diameter. Roll out one at a time, with a rolling pin, shaping into
circles about 6 inches in diameter. Roll only on one side; don't flip
dough, or it will be sticky. Place each circle on hot griddle for a
few seconds, until just beginning to brown. Turn and brown other
side. Stack tortillas on top of one another. Don't grease griddle.
Use a spatula, or fingers, to turn tortillas while cooking.
