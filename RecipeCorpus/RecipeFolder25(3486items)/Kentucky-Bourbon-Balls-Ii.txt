Title: Kentucky Bourbon Balls Ii
Categories: Candy, Holiday, Alcohol, Nuts/grains, Sthrn/livng
Yield: 1 batch
1/4 c  Bourbon whiskey
1 c  Chopped pecans
Cocoa; for garnish
1 c  Cake or vanilla wafer crumbs
1 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 c  Cocoa; or to taste
3 tb Clear corn syrup
Blend cake or vanilla wafer crumbs with the sugar, cocoa, corn syrup
and whiskey in a processor or electric mixer.  Stir in pecans.

If the mixture is too dry to roll easily into small truffle-size
balls, add a little more corn syrup.  The mixture should be soft.
Tasting is the best test.

Roll the balls in cocoa.  Store in a tin and refrigerate or freeze.

Yield: 30 to 36 bourbon balls.

Glenn writes: "This chocolate confection, half-cake/half-candy, is
believed to have been created in Kentucky by a German immigrant.  It
is impossible sometimes to unravel these culinary stories, but this I
know: The recipe traveled fast because it is one of the most
delightful chocolate candies to be so easy.

"It is at its best when made with leftover homemade cake, but vanilla
wafers work fine."
