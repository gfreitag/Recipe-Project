The following pizza recipe was inspired by the abundance of produce
that is available in the Southwest during the summer months.  Red,
ripe tomatoes are sweet and delicate in flavor; chiles range in taste
from subtle to robust; and fresh herbs are pungent and aromatic.
These ingredients provide a vigorous and distinctive flavor.
************************ Variation: This master pizza recipe can be
varied according to what you find in the garden, the market, and your
imagination.  Grilled rabbit, beans, tomatillos and raw onions are
all successful additions.
