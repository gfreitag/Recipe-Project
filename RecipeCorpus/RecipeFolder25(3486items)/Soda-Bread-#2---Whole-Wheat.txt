Title: Soda Bread #2 - Whole Wheat
Categories: British, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
2 ts Butter or margarine, cut in
-small pieces
2 c  Buttermilk
4 1/4    To 4-1/2 cups whole wheat
-graham flour
4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
Heat oven to 350F.   Grease a large cast-iron skillet or  baking
sheet. In a large bowl, mix 4 C.  flour with the baking powder,
baking soda, and salt.  Add butter and rub it into the flour by
scooping up handfuls of the mixture and rubbing it between  the palms
of your hands until pieces of butter  are  no  longer visible.

Add  buttermilk  to a bowl and stir with a  wooden  spoon  until
mixture forms  a dough.   Sprinkle about 1/4  cup of  remaining flour
on a board. Turn out dough and knead lightly for about 1 minute,
working in the flour from the board and forming  dough into a smooth,
round loaf about 8 inches in diameter.

Put loaf,  smooth side up,  in prepared pan and cut a deep cross in
it, slicing three-fourths of the way through the dough.  Bake 55-60
minutes, or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool
on a wire rack.
