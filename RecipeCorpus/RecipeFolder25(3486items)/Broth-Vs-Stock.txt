Title: Broth Vs Stock
Categories: Information, Chicken, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 info  The terms chicken stock and broth appear to have become synonymous ÄÄ
how many recipes call for "homemade chicken stock or canned chicken
broth"? Yet although broth and stock share common ingredients ÄÄ
chicken of some sort, onions, carrots, celery, and a bouquet garni
(thyme, bay leaf, and parsley sprigs) ÄÄ the similarities end there.

Broth is made with a whole chicken or chicken parts and simmered
until the chicken is done. The chicken is then pulled from the pot
and later either joins the  vegetables in the soup or is used in a
salad or casserole. Stock, however, is made from chicken bones, which
along with the vegetables, give their life to the stock, simmering in
the liquid for hours. The differences in taste cannot be overstated.
