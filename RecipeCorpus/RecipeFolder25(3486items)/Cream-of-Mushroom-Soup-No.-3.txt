Title: Cream of Mushroom Soup No. 3
Categories: Soup/stew, Mushroom, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
4 c  Half and half
1/4 t  White pepper
6 T  Butter or corn oil
1/2 lb Mushrooms, thinly sliced
-4 tbs all-purpose flour
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1 t  Salt
1 sm Onion, finely diced
In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter or corn oil and saute
the onion until it turns a rich golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.  Add
the sliced mushrooms and saute for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the
mushrooms soften and give up some of their juice. In a 3-quart
saucepan, heat the the remaining 4 tablespoon of the butter or oil.
Stir in the 4 tablespoons of flour. Cook, stirring constantly, to
make a golden roux, about 3 minutes. Do not let the roux turn brown.
Gradually add the half and half, using a whisk to beat the liquid
into the roux. Do this over low, steady heat and continue beating
with the whisk until all the liquid has been incorporated into the
roux.  Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently until the
mixture thickens. Stir in the sauteed onions and mushroom, salt, and
white pepper. Allow to heat through, but do not boil. Makes 4 to 6
servings. You can replace some or all of the half and half with
evaporated milk or even regular milk. NOTE: There was a time when
housewives discovered that there was a certain brand of canned cream
of mushroom soup that could be used to make an all- purpose sauce for
any number of stews, casserole or even vegetable dishes. As a result
everything from string beans to tuna casserole began to taste the
same, and good, old fashioned, blameless cream of mushroom soup
acquired a reputation for being just a little "tacky". But never
mind.  Forget the cans and try this easy from made-from-scratch
mushroom soup and you will understand why if was so popular to begin
with.
