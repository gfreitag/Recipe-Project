Title: No Cook "Marshmallow" Frosting
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 c  Sugar
3/8 c  Corn syrup, clear
1/8 ts Salt
1    Egg whites
Beat salt and egg white with electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Gradually add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until
smooth and glossy.  Continue beating and add corn syrup, a little at
a time, beating after each addition until frosting peaks.  Makes
enough to frost 9" layer cake or 9x13 cake.  Icing stays SOFT, easy
to spread.  Original recipe called for 2 egg whites and made too much
icing to use up.
