Title: Country Ham
Categories: Main dish, Pork, Sthrn/livng, Information
Yield: 24 servings
4 qt Ginger ale
10 lb Ham, country; to 15 lb.
Put ham in a clean can or very large pot filled with hot water (just
below the boiling point).  Let boil 10 or 15 minutes.  This step
gives the ham a good cleaning and removes excess salt from the
outside. Remove ham and discard water.

Place ham in can, and fill can half full with hot water.  Add ginger
ale, and put top loosely on can.  Bring to a full rolling boil; boil
30 minutes. (The ginger ale helps bring out the flavor of the ham.)

Place about 4 thicknesses of newspaper on the floor, and set ham
(still in can) on papers.  Press can lid on tightly; pull papers
around sides and top of can, and tie with string.  Cover with quilts
or blankets. Let sit for 10 to 14 hours according to size of ham. (A
12 to 13 lb. ham requires about 10 hours.)  Remove skin, and cut fat
from ham.

Slices of country ham can be fried or baked; serve as a main dish or
between bite-size biscuits as ah hors d'oeuvre.
