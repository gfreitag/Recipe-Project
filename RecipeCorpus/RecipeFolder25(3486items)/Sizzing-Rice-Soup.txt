turning once. Place on baking sheet and keep hot in oven.

For soup, place wok over med heat and pour in rice wine or mirin; add
onion and stir fry until soft but not browned.  Add celery, mushrooms
and cabbage; stir fry until lightly softened, about 5-8 mins.

Add broth and simmer 10 mins.  Scoop out 1/4c of hot soup and
dissolve miso in it, then return to wok.  Season to taste with soy

To serve, be sure rice patties are HOT, not just warm.  Place 1 patty
in each of 6 preheated soup bowls.  At the table, quickly pour hot
soup over rice.  Serve immediately.
