Title: Live-It-Up Carob Walnut Halvah
Categories: Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains
Yield: 48 slices
1/2 c  Sunflower seeds
1/2 ts Cinnamon
2 tb Carob powder
1/4 c  Crushed walnuts (optional)
1/4 c  Tahini
1/4 c  Honey
1/2 c  Unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 c  Wheat germ
Women in ancient Babylonia ate halvah to enhance their sex appeal,
and now research gives scientific support to this folklore. Potassium
in the sesame seeds and aspartic acid in the honey provide nutrients
that help relieve chronic fatigue and stimulate interest in
love-making!

In a medium-sized bowl, blend together the tahini and honey.  Using a
seed mill or blender, grind the coconut, wheat germ, and sunflower
seeds very fine.  Combine with the tahini mixture.  Add the carob and
cinnamon and knead the mixture into a ball of dough.

Separate the dough into 4 parts.  Roll each part into a roll about 1
inch in diameter, and coat with walnuts if you choose to use them.
Wrap each roll separately in wax paper and refrigerate.  Cut into
1/2-inch slices as needed.

Yield:  4 rolls, each 6 inches in length.  Each roll yields 12 slices
