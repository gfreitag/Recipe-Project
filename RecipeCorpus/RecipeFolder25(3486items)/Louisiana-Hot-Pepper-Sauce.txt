Title: Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Herbs/spice, Chilies
Yield: 1 servings
-peppers
3-4 cups fresh hot chili
MMMMM----------------------EQUAL AMOUNTS OF---------------------------
2 t  Salt
2 t  Cayenne pepper
White vinegar
Water
Cut chilies into quarters, removing seeds if desired. (I don't) Place
peppers in saucepan and add equal amounts of vinegar and water to just
cover peppers.  Boil for 10 minutes.  Remove from stove and
immediately add to blender or processor.  Whirl for about 2 minutes.
Let mixture "steep" for about 10 minutes.  Add salt and cayenne and
blend again for another 2 minutes or to your desired consistency.
Here you can strain the sauce for more of a "tabasco" look or use as
a puree (thicker) hot sauce. Both are excellent.  Process in a water
bath for 10-15 minutes if canning. Store in the fridge once opened.
Makes about 2 cups of puree. /\/\ichael ================= & Ms. /\/\
