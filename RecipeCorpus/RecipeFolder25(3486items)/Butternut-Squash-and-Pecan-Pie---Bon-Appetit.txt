FOR CRUST: Combine flour, sugar and salt in large bowl. Add butter and
shortening and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Mix ice water and cider vinegar; pour over flour mixture and
toss until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into
disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 45 minutes. (Can be prepared 1
day ahead. Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.)

FOR SQUASH FILLING: Preheat oven to 350 F. Cut squash in half
lengthwise. Scrape out seeds. Place cut side down in baking dish.
Bake until tender when pierced with knife, about 1 hour. Cool
completely. Scrape squash into processor, discarding peel. Puree
squash until smooth. Measure 1 C squash puree into medium bowl. Add
remaining ingredients; whisk until smooth. Roll out dough on floured
surface to 1/8-inch-thick round. Transfer to 9-inch diameter glass
pie dish. Press dough gently into dish. Trim dough, leaving 1/2-inch
overhang. Fold edge under and crimp decoratively, forming
high-standing rim. Freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.

FOR PECAN FILLING: Whisk first 5 ingredients in small bowl until
blended. Mix in 2/3 C chopped pecans.

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400'F. Spread
pecan filling in crust. Bake until filling is set and slightly
puffed, about 20 minutes. Cool 10 minutes.

Pour squash filling over pecan layer and smooth top. Bake until
squash is set in center, about 40 minutes. Cool completely on rack.
(Can be prepared 1 day ahead; cover and chill.)

Garnish pie with pecan halves. Cut into wedges and serve with whipped
cream, if desired.
