Title: Portuguese Sweet Bread with Macadamia Nuts
Categories: Bread, European, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
-beaten
3 ea To 3 1/4 cups white flour,
-preferably unbleached
4 T  Soft sweet butter
1 c  Macadamia nuts, roughly
-sliced
Makes 1 round loaf
1 T  Active dry yeast
3/4 c  Warm water
2 T  Nonfat dry milk
1/3 c  Sugar
pn Of salt
2 ea Eggs, at room temperature,
In a medium-size bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Stir in
the dry milk, sugar, salt, and beaten eggs.  Mix in 1 cup of the
flour, then beat in the soft butter a tablespoon at a time until it
is absorbed. Add enough more of the flour to make a manageable dough.
Turn the dough out on a floured work surface and let rest while you
clean and butter the bowl. Knead the dough lightly for a few minutes,
adding more flour as necessary, then return it to the bowl, cover
with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until double in
volume - about 1 hour. Turn the dough out, punch down, and knead in
the nuts.  Let rest, covered with a towel, for 10 minutes. Punch the
dough down again and form into a round. Place in a buttered 9-inch
cake pan, cover with a towel, and let rise again until double in
volume - about 45 minutes. Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 45
minutes.  Turn out and cool on a rack. The Book of Bread From the
