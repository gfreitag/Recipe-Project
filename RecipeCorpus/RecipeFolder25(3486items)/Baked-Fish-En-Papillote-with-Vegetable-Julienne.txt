Preheat the oven to 425. Rinse the fish, pat dry, and sprinkle
lightly with salt and pepper if you wish. Cut 4 double thickness of
aluminum foil, large enough to accommodate the fish. Brush with olive
oil. Lay a fish on each piece. Heat the tbs of olive oil in a large
heavy bottomed skillet and saute the vegetables and garlic together
over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring.  Add the Pernod and fennel
seed and continue to saute, stirring, for 5 minutes.  Add salt and
pepper to taste. Stuff the fish with some of this mixture and lay the
remaining vegetables over the fish. Squeeze the juice from half a
lemon over each fish. Enclose the fish in the foil and crimp the
edges together well. Place in a baking dish and bake in the preheated
oven for 20 minutes or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily.
Serve at once.
