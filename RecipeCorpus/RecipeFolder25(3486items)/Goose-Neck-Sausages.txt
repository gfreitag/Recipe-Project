Title: Goose-Neck Sausages
Categories: Can/preserv, Sausage, Poultry
Yield: 3 pounds
1/4 ts Allspice
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Fine grind white pepper
1 tb Vegetable oil
2 lb Chicken necks, about 10
3 lb Fresh goose
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Sage
1/2 ts Marjoram
Carefully, so as not to tear them, remove the skin from the chicken
necks. Use necks for something else. Mix remaining ingredients
together and run through the fine disk. Saute in a large skillet unti
the meat loses its raw look, about 10 minutes. Cool. Tie one end of
the chicken necks with chicken twine. Stuff and tie off other end.
Bake at 375 for 45 minutes, until the skins are crispy. Serve warm.
