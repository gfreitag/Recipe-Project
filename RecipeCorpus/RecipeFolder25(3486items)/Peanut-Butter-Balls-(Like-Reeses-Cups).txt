MMMMM----------------------ANOTHER VERSION---------------------------

All of the above, mix peanut butter, confectioners sugar, margarine
(or butter in one recipe) together.  Add graham cracker and coconut
(if using that recipe) to peanut butter mixture

Shape into little balls, place on waxed paper and chill for about one
hour.

Melt paraffin in top of double boiler until liquid, then add the
chocolate chips.

Keeping chocolate coating in double boiler, over low heat, dip each
ball into chocolate with two spoons.  Place on waxed paper to set (or
waxed candy cups).  They set firm in about 3 minutes. For coconut
version- after first coating, and completely set at end of batch,
take coated balls, and dip tops into coating, then into coconut -
forming a dome of coconut.

Makes anywhere from 80 - 100 balls depending on size.

If you have too much coating, leave at room temperature, and remelt
the next day in double boiler.
