Title: Rugelach 2
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 3 servings
6 T  Chopped raisins
6 T  Chopped walnuts
3/4 c  Jam (apricot, strawberry,
-or raspberry)
1 ea Egg yolk
1 T  Water
2 ea Sticks butter, softened
6 oz Cream cheese, room temp.
3 c  Flour
1/2 t  Salt
3/4 c  Sugar
2 t  Cinnamon
Combine the butter & cream cheese & beat until well mixed. Add the
flour & salt & mix until completely blended. The dough will be easier
to handle if you wrap & chill it for about an hour. Stir together 1/2
C. sugar & the cinnamon. Add the raisins & walnuts & toss to coat all
the pieces. Preheat oven to 375 degrees & get out some cookie sheets.
Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Keep chilled any dough you are
not working on. Roll 1 of the pieces into an 8" circle. Spread with 2
Tbsp. jam & sprinkle with 2 Tbsp. of the sugar-raisin- nut mixture.
Cut into 8 pie-shaped wedges. Beginning at the wide end, roll toward
the point, & form a crescent shape. Roll out & form the remaining
dough in the same way. Place the cookies, point side down, about 1"
apart on the ungreased cookie sheets. Mix together the egg yolk &
water & brush over the top of each cookie. Sprinkle each cookie with
a little of the remaining 1/4 C. sugar. Bake for about 15 minutes or
until lightly golden. Remove from oven & transfer to racks to cool.
48 cookies. This was shared with me on $p$ by Scott Hammon, who took
it from The Fannie Farmer Baking Book.
