Title: Spicy Christmas Ornaments
Categories: Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-------------------FROM: THERESA MERKLING------------------------
1 oz Ground nutmeg
1 oz Ground ginger
1 c  Applesauce
4 oz Ground cinnamon
1 oz Ground cloves
(did some research, from Reader's Digest, Secrets of Better cooking:
1oz = 1/8 c = 2 Tbs; 4 oz = 8 Tbs = 1/2 c.) Combine everything and
blend with your hands until dough is smooth.  Add more applesauce if
necessary. Divide dough into quarters. Sprinkle counter with cinnamon
and roll out portion of dough to 1/4" thick. Cut with cookie cutters
and transfer to cookie sheet. Pierce with skewer to form hole for
hanging. Turn ornaments every 12 hours and examine until they are
dry.  This takes 3 to 5 days. When the ornaments lose their scent,
dab on oil of cinnamon. Note: Roll out dough on aluminum foil and
move the foil onto the cookie sheet. It will help the ornaments keep
their shape. Note: You can alter the amounts as long as you use about
7 oz ground spices to 1 c applesauce.
