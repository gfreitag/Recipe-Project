Title: Dealing with Pumpkin

~ Pumpkins used for eating should be pumpkins raised for eating: 7
pounds or less.  They often have 'sugar' in the name, though not
always, and might be described as having 'firm, fine-grained flesh.'

~ Remove seeds, pulling off and discarding the stringy pulp.  Don't
wash the seeds.  Combine 1 cup of seeds with 1 tb. vegetable oil on a
baking sheet with sides.  Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp. salt and bake at 350
F. until seeds are light brown, about 20 to 30 minutes.

~ If you are mashing the pumpkin to pulp for cooking, cook before
peeling by steaming, microwaving or baking.  The skin should come off
easily when it's cooked.  Don't boil the pumpkin because it will
become waterlogged.

~ If you want to use pumpkin unmashed (as in the black bean soup and
pumpkin with apricot recipes in the accompanying story), microwave
large chunks of seedless pumpkin for a few minutes.  The pulp nearest
the skin should soften first, making it easier to peel.  Then you can
cube the meat and use it in recipes that require chunks of fresh
pumpkin.

~ The flesh of buttercup and butternut squashes, sweet potatoes and
pumpkins are often interchangeable in recipes.  The flavor will
change, of course, but all will taste good.

~ Squashes and pumpkins prefer to be stored in a cool, dry place.  An
enclosed, uninsulated porch or attic might be a better choice than a
damp but cool basement.

~ Pureed squash freezes well.  Keep three months at 0 degrees or
lower.

~ A pound of peeled, cubed pumpkin or squash makes about 2 cups puree.
