To make the sorbets: mix together the Kiwi fruit, sugar and water; rub
through a strainer and freeze in an ice cream machine. Repeat this
process for the raspberry sorbet and the orange sorbet. For the
raspberry and Kiwi fruit coulis, place the ingredients in a
liquidiser, blend and strain through a fine sieve. For the orange
coulis, bring the cream to the boil and infuse with orange peel.
Allow to cool on ice, remove the peel, and add the juice.

To make the branches: roll out the puff pastry to the thickness of a
coin. Using a template, cut out the shape of a branch and leaves.
Place on a lightly greased baking tray and brush with egg wash, three
times. Allow the pastry to relax for twenty minutes and bake in a
moderately hot oven until dark brown. Remove from oven, slice in half
as shown in the photograph. Arrange sorbets inside the pastry leaves.
Pipe the melted chocolate around the leaves and fill in with the
coulis as shown in the picture. Garnish with a mint leaf and serve
immediately. Bon Appetit-Exec.Chef Magnus Johansson Jul 94 Int'l
