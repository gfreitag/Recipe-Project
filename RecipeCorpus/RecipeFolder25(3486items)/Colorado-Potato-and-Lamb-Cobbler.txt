MMMMM-----------------TO BRUSH ON COBBLER DOUGH----------------------
1 tb Milk or cream
1    Egg yolk
*Cut from the shoulder or leg into 3/4" pieces, well trimmed.

Season lamb with salt and pepper; dredge with flour.

In a Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat oil to medium high heat.  Add lamb
and cook until well-browned on all sides.  Remove lamb from pot and
reserve. Add 1/2 cup stock, mushrooms, onions and garlic; cook,
stirring to scrape all brown bits from pan, until liquid has
evaporated and onions are tender. Add remaining stock, potatoes,
thyme and rosemary; cover and heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low;
add lamb and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes or until lamb
is tender. Season with additional salt and pepper if necessary. Stir
in chopped parsley. (Sauce should be the consistency of gravy. If
it's too thin, remove the ingredients to the casserole with a slotted
spoon and boil the sauce to reduce it.)

Meanwhile prepare cobbler dough.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Ladle lamb mixture into a 1 1/2 quart casserole
or 10" round deep-dish pie plate.  Top with cobbler dough, clustering
and overlapping leaves slightly, allowing open spaces for steam to
escape.

Beat together egg yolk and milk; brush dough with mixture.  Bake
about 20 minutes or until top is golden brown.

To make the cobbler dough:  In a small bowl, combine flour, sugar,
baking powder and salt.  Stir in cream; mix just until blended.
Gather dough into a ball.  On a lightly floured surface, roll dough
to about 1/4" thickness. Using a cookie cutter, cut dough into leaves
or other shapes; reroll scraps and cut more shapes.
