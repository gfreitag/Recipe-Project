This kid pleaser is even better on a prebaked pizza base than it ever
was on a bun.  You can add vegetable to the sauce, too - corn is
colorful. For the more adventurous, Asiago cheese is a zesty
substitute for Monterey Jack.  SErve with a crisp, fresh lettuce and
crunchy cucumber salad tossed with your favorite ranch dressing. 3/4
lb lean ground beef 3/4 cup spicy spaghetti sauce (commercial or
homemade) 1 10 inch round prebaked pizza crust 1/2 cup chopped green
onions 1 cup shredded monterey jack cheese

In large skillet, heat 1 tsp vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add
beef and cook, breaking up meat with back of spoon, for 4-5 minutes

sauce, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Place pizza crust on baking
sheet.  Spread sauce over crust.  Sprinkle with green onions, scatter
shredded cheese over top. Bake in 400F oven for 20-25 minutes or
until cheese is bubbly and golden. Makes 4 serings.  Per serving:
