Categories: Side dish, Thai, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
4 oz Rice vermicelli
3 c  Vegetable oil, for deep fryg
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
-- juice
4 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Tamarind water -=OR=- lime
MMMMM-------------------------SEASONINGS------------------------------
1 tb Tomato paste
3 tb Soy sauce
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 tb Onions, chopped
1 tb Garlic, chopped
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
1 ts Red pepper flakes, optional
Lemon wedges
1/2 c  Bean sprouts
1 tb Cilantro leaves, chopped
2 ea Green onions, diced
Heat the oil to very hot.  Drop a handful of uncooked noodles into
the hot oil.  They will immediately puff up to several times their
size. Turn them over & quickly fry the other side.  The entire
process only takes a few seconds.  Do not let the noodles brown.
Drain on paper towels.

Make the SYRUP by combining the water & tamarind water with sugar in a
small pot.  Cook over medium heat until it thickens.

Prepare the SEASONINGS by heating 1 tb vegetable oil in a wok or
skillet. Add the onion & garlic & stir-fry until lightly browned. Add
the tomato paste & soy sauce & stir-fry a further 3 minutes.

Clean the bean sprouts & remove the roots if you want.  Place the
noodles in a large bowl & pour the SYRUP & SEASONINGS mixture over
them at once & mix thoroughly with your hands.

Add the bean sprouts, cilantro & green onions & mix again, being
careful not to break the noodles into too small pieces.  Sprinkle
with the red pepper flakes if desired & serve with the lemon wedges.
