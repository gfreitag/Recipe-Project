Title: Stir Fried Pumpkin with Fermented Black Beans
Categories: Chinese, Stir fry, Main dish, Vegetable, Beans
Yield: 1 batch
2 tb Dark soy sauce or Kikkoman
-soy sauce
1/3 c  Whole shucked clams (opt'l.)
-- or canned ones, drained
-or-
1/3 c  Ground pork (opt'l.)
2    To 3 tb oil
1/2    Acorn squash*
1 tb Fermented black beans,
-- rinsed
3    Garlic cloves; crushed
2    Thin slices of ginger root
-- no peeling needed
*Sliced 1/4" to 1/2" thick and into bite sizes.

Heat 2-3 tbs. oil in a wok or skillet.  Drop in the ginger, garlic and
black beans.  Stir it around for about 20 seconds.

If you are  using pork, add it now  (If you are using clams, add them
last). Cook until the pork is a little browned and then add the
squash. (If you are not using pork or clams, add the squash at this
step) Cook until the squash is tender. If the whole thing is a little
dry, a tb. or two of water should be added to deglaze the wok.

Now add the clams, if you are using them, and stir it around until the
clams are done.

I like to spoon it over rice so I use a little cornstarch mixed with
water and a little soy sauce and add it the mixture to make more
sauce.

of the American custom of carving pumpkins at Halloween (I, the first
in my family to be born in this country, was not aware of this
practice until I was 5 years old).  So every year at this time of
year the appearance of the pumpkin heralded another family
custom...my Grandmother's stir fried pumpkin with fermented black
beans. It was her favorite and has become mine. I have modified the
recipe for use with acorn squash because they are of a more
manageable size, and have a better taste than the Jack-O-Lantern
pumpkins that are commonly available now." Formatted by Cathy Harned.
