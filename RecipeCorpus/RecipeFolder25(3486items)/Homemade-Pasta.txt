Title: Homemade Pasta
Categories: Pasta, Homemade, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  WATER
1 t  OLIVE OIL
2 1/2 c  All Purpose Flour
1/4 t  SALT
2 ea EGGS (Well Beaten)
Mix flour and salt in a large bowl.  Make a well in the middle of the
flour and pour in eggs, water and oil. Mix with hands by folding the
flour into the well.  Turn the mix onto floured, flat area and knead
until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. It will feel
considerably tougher than bread dough. Now we've got a large ball of
hard dough to make into little noodles. By hand: divide the dough in
half and roll it out on a lightly floured counter. It may become too
elastic. Just let it rest for a few minutes, and it will be fine to
try again. It is best if only a 1/16 of an inch thick, but it won't
hurt if thicker. By pasta machine: divide dough into thirds and pass
through at the machine's widest roller opening. Then set the machine
to the next smallest opening and repeat. If dough tears and gets
messy, fold over and start again after letting it rest five minutes.
Cut pasta into specific size; 1/4" for fettuccine, 3" for lasagna.
Cook pasta - 2-4 minutes in three quarts of boiling water with a
tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of cooking oil added.  Stir the
pasta to keep it from sticking.  Do not rinse pasta.  This only gives
you cold pasta. Serve immediately. Complements of Lon Walters whose
