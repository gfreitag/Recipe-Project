Categories: Potato, Pork, Cheese/eggs, Side dish
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
Bake one large potato. Cut in half.  Scoop out the inside, leaving
about a quarter inch shell of potato (reserve insides for hashed
browns or whatever).  Cut each half into four equal strips. Deep fry
the skins until crisp and brown.  Drain, and set aside. When skins
are cool, top with 3 oz. shredded yellow cheddar cheese, one half
ounce Parmesan cheese, and 2 oz. white cheddar cheese (you could
substitute Jack). Top with three slices of cooked bacon, crumbled.
You can do this up to 12 hours before serving if you like.  Just
cover, and refrigerate until needed.

At serving time, microwave 3 minutes, 20 seconds.  Serve garnished
with sour cream and chopped green onion.
