%%%%% DILL SEED  %%%%%
A pickle wouldn't be a pickle without dill - the seeds are the major
ingredient in pickling spice.  Its pungent, aromatic flavor livens up
fish and chicken dishes, salads, sauerkraut, green beans, stews, egg
dishes, salad dressing, creamy sauces and dairy products, such as
sour cream, cottage cheese and yogurt. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% FENNEL SEED %%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Like aniseed,
fennel has a licorice flavor, but it's less intense.  The small,
oval, greenish brown seeds of sweet fennel give Italian sausage and
pepperoni their characteristic flavor. Fennel is also used in fish
dishes, in curry powder and in pickling mixtures for sweet pickles
and salad dressing. Try it in eggs, vegetables or as Italian bakers
do, in breads and rolls. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%
FENUGREEK SEED  %%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% This seed actually
comes from a plant in the pea family.  It's primarily used in curry
powder, but you'll also find it in chutneys, pickling mixtures and
confections. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% MUSTARD SEED %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The seeds for making mustard come in
several shades; white, yellow and brown. The make the mustard that
goes on your hot dog, the seeds are milled to make mustard flour,
then mixed with salt, vinegar, and spices. Mustard seeds are used in
pickling mixtures, vegetable relishes, corned beef, coleslaw and
sauerkraut. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%  POPPY SEED  %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Tiny, blue-black, nutty tasting poppy seeds
contain no narcotics, although they come from the same plant that
produces opium.  Whole seeds are used as a topping for breads, rolls,
cookies, cakes and other baked goods. Browned in butter, they're
delicious over noodles, fish and cooked vegetables. Try themin fruit
salads, cottage cheese, cream cheese and scrambled eggs. Crushed
seeds, mixed with honey, become a filling for the Jewish Hamentashen
or Purim (festive holiday) cakes. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%
SESAME SEED %%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Small, flat, oval sesame
seeds add eye and flaor appeal to rolls and breads, breadsticks,
cokies ro crackers. They're baked into Southern benne (another word
for sesame seed) biscuits. Origin: Michigan Newspaper, Food Section,
