Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 60 servings
3/4 c  White flour
1/4 t  Baking soda
1/4 t  Baking powder
4 md Eggs, separated
1 t  Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Plus 1T Unsweet frozen Pine-
Apple-orange conc. Thawed
Line a 10" x 15" jelly roll pan with buttered wax paper; set aside.
Beat egg yolks in a small bowl at high speed for 5 minutes or until
thick and lemon coloured. Add vanilla extract and pineapple-orange
juice concentrate. Beat just to blend. Toss together flour, baking
soda and baking powder; fold into liquid. Set aside.

In a separate bowl beat egg whites until very thick, and peaks hold
their shape. Gently fold juice mixture into egg whites until just
blended. Spoon batter into jelly roll pan, and smooth evenly in pan.
Bake in a preheated oven at 325 degrees for 15 minutes or until firm
to the touch. Allow cake to cool in the pan 10 minutes. With a sharp
knife loosen cake from pan and pry up wax paper to loosen all edges.
Cover cake with a large wire rack and flip over. Remove pan and
carefully peel of wax paper. Use a sharp knife if necessary to loose
paper from cake. Allow to cool completely.

To make lady fingers, invert cooled cake onto a flat surface. Using a
ruler as a guide cut cake into quarters lengthwise and 1" pieces
widthwise. Cut a small point on the end of each cake rectangle. Place
ladyfingers browned side down onto a large baking sheet. Bake in a
preheated oven at 325 degrees for 5 minutes until crisp. Cool on wire
racks.

Use as directed in recipes or freeze for future use. To freeze,
loosely pack lady fingers in freezer containers. To use after
freezing, place frozen lady fingers on baking sheets to thaw. Bake
for 3-5 minutes in a 325 degree oven to crispness.

Yields 60 ladyfingers.
