Title: Mcdonald's Egg Mcmuffin (Ts)
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Pork
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea English muffin
1 sl Canadian bacon
1 ea Egg
1 sl American cheese
"You will need an empty
-clean can with the same
-diameter as
An English muffin.  A 6 1/2
-oz. tuna can works best."
Split the English muffin and brown each face in a hot pan. Set aside.
Keep the pan on medium heat. In a frying pan of boiling water, cook
the Canadian bacon for 10 minutes. Grease the inside of the (tuna)
can with shortening or coat with a nonstick spary. Place the greased
can in the hot pan over medium heat and crack the egg into the
center. Break the yolk and lightly salt the egg.  When the surface of
the egg begins to firm, cut around the inside of the can with a
butter knife to free the edges. Pull the can off the egg; turn the
egg over and cook for 1 minute more. Build the sandwich in the
following stacking order from the bottom up: Bottom English muffin
American cheese egg Canadian bacon Top English muffin Microwave for
15 to 20 seconds on high for uniform heating, if desired. Note: I'm
sure you are to remove both the top and bottom of the tuna can with a
can opener, leaving the sides only and clean the remaining can. I
just mention this because I don't think the recipe really makes that
clear. - Debbie Carlson Makes:  1 sandwich From: "Top Secret Recipes"
