Categories: Dessert, Diabetic, Cake/cookie
Yield: 16 cookies
MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT AND NUTS----------------------------
1/3 c  Raisins
1/3 c  Walnuts
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/4 t  Nutmeg
1/8 t  Salt
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
1 t  Baking powder
2 t  Cinnamon
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/4 c  Raisin water
1/3 c  Oil
1/4 c  Fruit sweetener
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line baking sheets with baking
paper. Toast the walnuts in the preheated oven for 7-10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool. Then process in a food
processor, using the pulsing action, until they are coarsely chopped.
Bring 2/3 cup water to a boil and add the raisins. When the water
returns to the boil, turn off the heat. Let the raisins plump in the
water for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins, saving the raisin
water. Sift the flour, baking powder, spices and salt into a large
mixing bowl. Stir in the rolled oats. In a medium size bowl, whisk
the wet ingredients together until thickened. Stir the wet mix into
the dry ingredients, mixing for one minute until the oats begin to
break down. Stir in the chopped walnuts and the plumped raisins.
Using a #24 (2 tablespoons) scoop, or a spoon, scoop out the dough
and place the balls 1 inch apart on the baking sheets, with lightly
moistened fingers, flatten each cookie to a thickness of 1/3 inch.
Bake until golden brown, 15-18 minutes. Remove the cookies to a wire
rack to cool.
