Title: Rosie's Un-Fried French Fries
Categories: Low-cal/fat, Vegetable, Potato
Yield: 4 servings
2    Large egg whites
1 tb Cajun spice
5    Large baking potatoes
Light vegetable oil spray
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Slice each potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch ovals, then slice even oval
lengthwise into match sticks.

Coat a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegetable oil (like PAM).

Combine the egg whites and Cajun spice in a bowl.  Add the match stick
potatoes and mix to coat.  Pour the coated potatoes onto the prepared
baking sheet and spread them out into a single layers, leaving a
little space between.

Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the fries are crispy, turning them
every 6 to 8 minutes with a spatula so that they brown evenly. Serve
immediately.
