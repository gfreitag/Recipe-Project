oven and cool.

2. TO PREPARE THE SALAD: Place the chicken in a pan and cover with
water. Bring just to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to medium-low.
Cook 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.  Remove from the
liquid and cool.  Cut into small chunks or pull into shreds.

3. Combine the chicken with the celery, raisins and lemon peel.

mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, honey, rosemary, salt and pepper.
Stir into the salad, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

5. Wash the romaine and radicchio, pat dry and wrap in paper towels.
Refrigerate.

teaspoon olive oil.  Tear the lettuce into small pieces and toss with
the lemon-oil mixture.  Divide between plates and top with the
