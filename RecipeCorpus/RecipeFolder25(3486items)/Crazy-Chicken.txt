Categories: Chicken, Fruit, Herbs/spice, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 9 servings
1 t  Ground turmeric (don't

Color and a little nip.)
1/2 t  Garlic salt
1/4 t  Black pepper
9 ea Chicken pieces (3 lb cut-up
-broiler/fryer w/skin on)
Chicken broth
1/3 c  Lemon juice
1/3 c  Lime juice
1/3 c  Canola OR vegetable oil
In a deep-sided skillet, simmer the chicken pieces with skin intact
in a single layer without crowding in chicken broth to cover, only
until the chicken meat appears milky white and the juices run clear
and are no longer pink.  Allow to cool, uncovered in broth.
Meanwhile, prepare the basting mixture by mixing together lemon and
lime juices, oil, turmeric, garlic salt and pepper. Arrange chicken
pieces, skin side up, in a single layer on a broiler pan. Brush with
basting mixture to evenly coat skin. Turn and baste underneath side.
Turn chicken skin side up. Broil 6 inches from heat, brushing with
basting mixture every few minutes until skin is crispy and golden
brown, about 5 to 8 minutes total fro large chicken pieces and 4 to 6
minutes total for smaller pieces.  Makes 9 chicken pieces. Gloria
