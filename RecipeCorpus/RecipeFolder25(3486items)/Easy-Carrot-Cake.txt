Title: Easy Carrot Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Vegetable, Nuts/grains
Yield: 30 servings
MMMMM---------------------ADD IN ORDER GIVEN--------------------------
1/4 ts Nutmeg
3 c  Raw carrots, grated fine
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Sifted flour
2 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
1 c  Pecans, chopped
1/3 c  Karo
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Brown sugar
4 x  Eggs
1 1/2 c  Salad oil
1 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Cloves
1/4 ts Ginger
Beat sugar, eggs, Karo and oil until light and fluffy. ***Be sure
you beat this a long time. I beat the entire time I grate carrots.
Add rest of ingredients in order given. *Do not beat much after
adding flour. Pour into 3-8"pans and bake at 350 degrees until, when
touched lightly with your finger, the cake barely springs back up.
Notes:
Only one recipe will fit in the ordinary mixer bowl at one time.
-2 mixes makes 1-16" layer, or 1-12",plus 1-8" layer, or 2-10"
layers plus 1-6"layer.
A 12" and 6" 2-layer cake requires over 1-2lb bag of carrots and 3
recipes.
one recipe makes 1-10" plus 2-6" layers.
one recipe is not quite enough for 1-14" layer
2 mixes makes 1-14" layer plus 1-10" layer *One bag of carrots
makes 2 recipes and a little over
For a 2-layer 14",10",6" cake, use 5 lbs carrots & 4 cups pecans+5
recipes.   Also need: 3 pks carrots, 1/2 bags brown sugar, 2 pks
pecans, over 1 qt Crisco oil.
Line bottoms of pans with baker's parchment/grease & flour the
parchment too!  Cake tends to stick in the pans. Source: A bride to
