Title: Persimmon Habanero Salsa
Categories: Condiment, Fruit, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 batch
1 lg Garlic clove
-- peeled and cut up
1/4    To 1/2 ts. Quatre Epices**
1    Very ripe kaki persimmon*
1    Ripe habanero; seeded
-- deveined and cut up
MMMMM-----------------------QUATRE EPICES----------------------------
3 1/2 tb Ground ginger
4 tb Ground nutmeg
1 1/8 c  Ground white pepper
1 1/2 tb Ground or powdered cloves
*I.e. one of the Asian types, not the American native.

**If you can't find Quatre Epices in a specialty food store, you can
make your own.  In France it's much used in charcouterie, but I like
it a lot in prune butter, pumpkin pie and apple crisp. Larousse
Gastronomique gives the following formula, but I think the one I buy
here in Philadelphia at Assouline & Ting has less pepper.

Scrape the flesh of the persimmon off the skin and into a food
processor; add the habanero, garlic and Quatre Epices. Pulse until
smooth.

If you cook this, it gets very thick and loses some of the terrific
persimmon color and some heat, but it isn't bad sauteed briefly.
Store in a closed jar in the refrigerator.

Goldstein's note: I had it with boneless pork chops just cooked in a
bit of olive oil, but you could add some of the salsa to the chops
after they've been browned over high heat; lower the heat and let the
chops cook in the salsa for 10-15 minutes.

Combine the spices really well...you could even use a hand mixer, and
store in a closed jar.

Yield: About 1 cup.
