Title: Brandied Mushroom-Walnut Pate
Categories: Vegetable, Condiment, Nuts/grains, Appetizer
Yield: 4 cups
1 T  Light miso, or to taste
3 T  Cognac
1/4 t  Grond allspice
Several grating of fresh
Nutmeg
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Mild vegetable oil, such as
Corn or peanut or 8 T butter
1 lg Onion, chopped
1 md Carrot, scrubbed and grated
1 1/2 lb Domestic white mushrooms,
Sliced
1 c  English walnuts, toasted
1. The day before serving, in a 10-inch skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the
oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and saute until it starts to
soften, about 3 minutes.  Add the carrot and saute until slightly
softened, about 3 minutes more.  Scrape the onion and carrot into a
food processor.

2. Add about one-third of the remaining oil to the skillet and heat
over medium heat.  Add one-third of the mushrooms and saute until the
mushrooms become limp, about 7 minutes.  Scrape the mushroooms into
the food processor and repeat with the remaining oil and mushrooms.

3. Add to the processor the walnuts, peanut butter, miso, cognac,
allspice, nutmeg, salt, and plenty of pepper.  Puree until absolutely
smooth. (It will be very thick.)  Taste and adjust the seasoning. It
may need additional miso, which gives it a salty, meaty heartiness.

4. Transfer the pate to a crock (or, less glamorously, to a
refrigerator storage dish).  Cover and refrigeate overnight ot ripen.
