Make the dough.  Mix together all the ingredients, except the egg
yolk, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.  Add the egg yolk
and quickly work into the dough.  Set aside in the fridge to rest for
at least 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 200øC/400øF/Gas Mark 6.  Roll out the dough and
use to line a high-sided, loose-bottomed cake tin.  Prick the base
with a fork. Bake the dough shell blind for 10 mins.

Make the filling.  Separate the eggs.  Press the curd cheese through a
sieve.

Mix together all the ingredients, except the egg whites.  Beat the egg
whites to form stiff peaks and fold them into the mixture.  Pour the
filling into the dough shell.

Bake for approximately 40-50 mins, until the mixture feels firm.
Cover with foil if the top starts to brown before the filling has
cooked.

Serve cold with a pure of strawberries or raspberries.
