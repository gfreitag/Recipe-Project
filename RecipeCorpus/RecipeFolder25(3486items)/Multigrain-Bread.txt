5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and stir in
margarine or butter until melted; stir in molasses and solt. Let cool
completely. Dissolve sugar in lukewarm water; sprinkle in yeast and
let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.  In large mixing bowl,
combine yeast mixture with cereal mixture. Using wooden spoon,
gradually beat in enough of the flour to make stiff dough. Knead for
about 10 minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease
all over.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours
or until doubled in bulk. Punch down dough, turn out onto lightly
floured surface and knead into smooth ball. Cover and let rise for 10
minutes. Divide dough in half, shape each portion into loaf and place
in greased loaf pans.  Cover and let rise for about 1 hour or until
doubled in bulk. Bake loaves in 375 oven for 30 to 35 minutes or
until golden brown. Submitted By FLORENCE THOMPSON   On   11-28-94
