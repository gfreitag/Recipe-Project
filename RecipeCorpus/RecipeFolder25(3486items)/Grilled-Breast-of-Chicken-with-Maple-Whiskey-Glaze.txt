Categories: Bbq/grill, Main dish, Poultry, Chicken
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Pure maple syrup
3 tb Jack Daniel's whiskey
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Dried thyme; rubbed

-- skinned and split
Rub thyme over both sides of chicken breasts; set aside.

Grill or broil breasts, basting frequently with marinade for a shiny
