Title: Italian Style Dry Sausage
Categories: Pork, Sausage, Italian, Homemade
Yield: 10 pounds
1 tb Garlic, finely minced
2 tb Coarse grind black pepper
1 c  Dry red wine
1/2 ts Ascorbic acid
1 ts Saltpeter
6    Feet medium hog casings
8 lb Lean pork, cubed
2 lb Cubed pork fat
5 tb Salt
1 tb Sugar
5 ts Fennel seed
2 ts Anise seed
Grind meat and fat separately through the coarse disk. Mix together
with remaining ingredients. Spread mixture in a large pan, cover
loosley with waxed paper and cure in the fridge for 24 hours. Prepare
casings, stuff and twist into 4" lengths. tie each off with cotton
twine. Hang the links 6-8 weeks, checking after six weeks by cutting
in half. If the texture is firm enough to suit your taste, the
remaining sausage may be cut down and wrapped tightly for storage in
the refrigerator. Prolonged drying will result in a sausage that has
the texture of something like beef jerky, at which time you can
either gnaw on it like a dog with a bone or use it to club intruders.
