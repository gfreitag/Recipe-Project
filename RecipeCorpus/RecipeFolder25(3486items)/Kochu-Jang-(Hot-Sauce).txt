Title: Kochu Jang (Hot Sauce)
Categories: Asian, Condiment, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 gallons
- (dried barley sprout malt)
2 c  MEJU powder (soy bean malt)*
8 1/3 c  Water
7 1/2 c  Glutenous rice powder
5 1/2 c  Chili powder
5 1/2 c  Salt
4 c  YEODKIREUM powder
* NOTE: Available in Korean markets. Consists of soy beans which are
made into dumplings, fermented, dried, and then powdered.

In a bowl, combine YEODKIREUM powder and water.   Mix well, then
strain off liquid into a large pot.  Add glutenous rice powder to
liquid and mix well. Cook over low heat (113F, 45C).  Remove from
heat and allow to stand until rice powder is dissolved.

Heat to boiling, then reduce heat and let cook for 30 minutes.

Transfer to a large bowl to cool.  When completely cool, stir in MEJU
and chili powder and blend well.  Leave overnight.

The next day, mix in 4 cups of the salt and transfer mixture to a
large container.  Sprinkle remaining salt over, then cover with
loosely woven cloth such as cheesecloth or gauze.  Leave in a sunny
place to ferment, stirring occasionally, for one month.

ADDITIONAL NOTES: Use a large container, as mixture rises as it
ferments. During fermentation, cover container at night.
