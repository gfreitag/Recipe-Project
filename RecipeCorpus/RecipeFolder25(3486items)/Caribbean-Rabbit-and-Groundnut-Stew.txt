In "The Complete book of Caribbean Cooking," Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz
credits the recipe to the former British Leeward Islands - now the
independent nations of St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda - but we
note that they're pretty close to Guadeloupe, which is so French it
actually votes in the French parliament.

In heavy pot, melt salt pork. remove crackling and brown rabbit
pieces in melted fat. Add onion and garlic and saute until tender.
Add stock, bay leaf, thyme, marjoram, parsley and salt and pepper to
taste. Cover and cook at low heat until rabbit is tender, about 1
hour.

Ladle off 2 cups cooking liquid. Place 1 cup in blender or food
processor with chilies, peanut butter and nutmeg. Process until
smooth. Put second cup cooking liquid in saucepan with peanut butter
mixture and simmer gently 15 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste. Add
rabbit pieces and simmer on very low heat just long enough to heat
meat through. Serve with rice and pass hot pepper sauce.
