takes it's inspiration from an Armenian dish that is traditionally
made with lamb and served on rounds of yeast bread.  For convenience,
beef replaces the lamb, and tortillas (always handy) make this a no
fuss dinner. Chopped green onion, sliced olives and diced tomatoes
would also make great accompaniments to sprinkle over top. 1 tsp
vegetable oil 1 onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tsp paprika
3/4 tsp groundallspice 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper 1 lb lean ground
beef 14 oz tomatoes (canned) 1/4 cup tomato paste 1 sweet green
pepper, chopped 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 8 8-inch flour
tortillas, warmed 1 cup diced cucumber 1 cup feta cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup hot pickled peppers Saute onion and garlic. Add paprika,
allspice, salt and pepper.  Add ground beef and cook until meat is
thoroughly cooked.  Add canned tomatoes and tomato paste. Boil and
then reduce to simmer.  Add green pepper and the parsley and cook for
10-15 minutes or until most of liquid has cooked off. Divide beef
mixture among tortillas, fold

tortillas in half to form pockets.  Sprinkle with cucumber, feta
cheese, and pickled peppers.  Makes 4 servings. Origin: Canadian
