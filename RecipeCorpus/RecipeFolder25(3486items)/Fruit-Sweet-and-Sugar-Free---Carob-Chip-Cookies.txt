3 c  White flour
2 c  Carob chips

1 c  Butter
1/2 c  +2 T fruit sweetener

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the walnuts for 7-10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Let nuts cook, and process in a food process
until coarsely chopped. Cream the butter and sweetener until light
and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Stir in the vanilla, baking soda and salt. When mixed, add
the flour, carob chips, and coarsely ground walnuts. Cover the dough
and refrigerate it for 20 minutes to make it easier to handle.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line baking sheets with baking
paper. Using a #24 (2 tablespoon) or a spoon, scoop out the dough and
place balls one inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. With
lightly moistened fingers flatten each cookie to a thickness of 1/3
inch. Bake the cookies until golden brown for 15-18 minutes. Remove
the cookies to a wire rack to cool.
