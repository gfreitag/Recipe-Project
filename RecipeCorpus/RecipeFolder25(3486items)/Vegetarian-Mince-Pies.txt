MINCEMEAT:  Mix everything together either by hand or, if you desire a
smoother texture, in a food processor.

PASTRY:  Rub shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles
fine breadcrumbs.  Add enough flour to enable the pastry to hold
together. Roll out pastry & cut into 12 cm circles.  Press circles
into the bottom of lightly oiled baking tins.  Fill with mincemeat &
cover with another pastry circle.  Press down at the edges & make a
small steam hole in the top. Bake for 10 minutes at 400F, 200C Gas 6.

These pise can be frozen before baking either in the tin or remove
from tin once they are solid.

Mincemeat will keep for 1 week covered in the fridge.

Makes 36 pies
