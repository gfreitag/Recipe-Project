Categories: Dessert, Nuts/grains, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 pie
2 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Brown sugar
16 oz Can unseasoned pumpkin
1 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1 c  Light cream
1    Unbaked 9" single crust pie
-shell, well-pricked w/fork
2 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Softened butter
4 tb Finely chopped crystallized
-ginger
4 tb Finely chopped walnuts
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
-cream
Lightly sweetened whipped
Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Combine the 2 tb. of sugar, butter, crystallized ginger and walnuts
until crumbly.  Gently press mixture into the bottom of the pie
shell. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown,
about 10 minutes.

While crust is baking, whisk eggs with 1/2 cup brown sugar, pumpkin,
spices and cream until smooth.  Pour filling into the prebaked shell
and bake until a table knife inserted toward the edge just comes out
clean, about 40 minutes.  (The center should be moist, since it
continues cooking as it cools.)  Cool pie on a wire rack and serve in
wedges with whipped cream.

Ligon writes: "Disguised as an ordinary, run-of-the-mill pumpkin pie,
this version has a crunchy surprise layer in the bottom that helps
keep the crust from becoming soggy.  Some years we've made the
filling from home-grown pumpkin - a messy and tedious process.  You
can emulate the flavor and texture with canned pumpkin, though, if
you take time to caramelize it lightly by stirring it over
medium-high heat in a heavy skillet for half an hour or so."
