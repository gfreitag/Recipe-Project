boiling. Cook at a boil for 10 minutes and then lower heat to Medium
Low for 15 minutes stirring several times. Lower heat again to simmer
& cook for 1.5 -2 hours stirring frequently. Add remaining cumin
after cooking for 1 hour. You may make this hotter by gashing the
sides of the Jalapeno peppers & by adding more of them. This recipe
when served over rice with fresh, piping hot cornbread is hard to
