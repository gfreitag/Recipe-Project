Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for 10 mins to soften.

Mix the icing sugar and water in a small saucepan and boil vigorously
for 10 mins.  Strain the gelatine leaves and pour in a little of the
hot sugar mixture.  Stir well so that the gelatine melts.

Beat the egg yolks in a large bowl.  Beating continuously, pour in
the hot sugar mixture in a thin stream over the egg yolks.  Work
quickly, otherwise the mixture will become lumpy.  Add the dissolved
gelatine, mix thoroughly and set aside to cool.

Pure the raspberries in a food processor or by rubbing through a wire
strainer.  Whip the cream.  Stir the raspberry pure and the cream
into the egg mixture.  Beat the egg whites to form soft peaks and
fold carefully into the raspberry mousse.  Pour the raspberry mousse
into a serving bowl or into separate dessert dishes.  Place in the
fridge for several hours or overnight to set.

Garnish just before serving.
