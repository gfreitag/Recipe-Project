In Laos the beef is dried in the hot sun in a net cage, to discourage
predators, for a day. It can be made succesfully in a gas oven with a
lighted pilot flame burning, but an electric oven is not suitable as
it is impossible to keep the heat low enough. Instructions: Trim off
any fat & slice beef into 1/8 in thick strips of equal thickness.
This is important for even drying. Mix all ingredients thoroughly and
marinate for at least 3 hours, or refrigerate overnight. Arrange meat
on racks, spaced so air can circulate, and place in a gas oven with
the pilot light lit for 10-12 hrs., with the door closed. Or, if
possible, dry meat in the sun, turning once during the drying
process. Beef strips should be removed as they dry to an airtight
container, where they will keep for 3 weeks. Beef can also be frozen
for up to 9 months. Strips can be broiled briefly to enhance flavor
before serving. From: Cuisines of Southeast Asia by Gwenda L. Hyman
