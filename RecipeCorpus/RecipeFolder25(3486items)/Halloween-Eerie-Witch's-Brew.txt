concentrate 1 can (6-oz) thawed frozen limeade concentrate 2 cups
seedless grapes 4 cups water 2 bottles (32 oz each) ginger ale 1 to 2
lbs dry ice Directions: In a 1 to 2 quart pan, bring 1 cup of
cranberry juice and candied ginger to a boil over high heat.  Boil,
uncovered, about 2 minutes, set aside. With a vegetable peeler, pare
peel (colored part only) from oranges; cut peel into thin 2-inch-long
worms; or use an Oriental shredder to make long shreds. Add orange
peel to cranberry mixture.  Cover and chill at least 4 hours or as
long as overnight. Juice oranges; put juice in a 6 to 8 quart pan or
heavy bowl. Stir in cranberry-ginger mixture, the 3 cups cranberry
juice, apple concentrate, limeade, grapes and water. If made ahead,
cover and chill up to 2 hours. Add ginger ale and about a 1 pound
piece of dry ice (DO NOT put small pieces in punch or cups); ice
should smolder at least 30 minutes. Ladle into cups.  Add any
remaining ice when bubbling ceases. Makes 5 quarts; allow about 1-1/2
cups for a serving.
