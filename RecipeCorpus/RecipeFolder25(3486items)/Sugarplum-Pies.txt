MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 lg Egg
1 tb Vanilla extract
1/3 c  Milk
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Butter or margarine; not

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 tb Lemon juice

3/4 c  Chopped pitted prunes
3/4 c  Chopped dried apricots or

1/3 c  Water
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1.  DOUGH:  Mix flour, baking powder and salt.  In a large bowl, beat
butter and sugar with electric mixer until pale and fluffy.  Beat in
egg and vanilla until blended.  With mixer on low speed, beat in
flour mixture alternately with milk just until blended.  Dough will
be soft and slightly sticky.  Divide in fourths.  Shape dough into 4
balls. Flatten each to a 1-inch thick round.  Wrap in plastic wrap
and refrigerate 4 hours or until firm enough to handle.

2.  MEANWHILE MAKE FILLING:  Cook prunes, apricots, water and sugar
in a small uncovered saucepan over medium-low heat, about 5 minutes,
stirring 2 or 3 times, until fruit is tender and water is absorbed.
Remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice, walnuts and nutmeg.  Cool
completely.

3.  Heat oven to 350F.  Lightly grease cookie sheets.

4.  On a floured surface with floured rolling pin, roll out
one-fourth the dough at a time to 1/8-inch thickness.  (Keep
remainder refrigerated.) Cut with a plain or scalloped 2-inch round
cutter.

5.  Place half the rounds 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheet.  Top
each with 1 teaspoon filling.  Moisten edges with water.  Top with
remaining rounds and press edges with fingertip to seal.  With a
small sharp knife, cut an "X" in center of tops.  Sprinkle tops with
granulated sugar.

6.  Bake 9 to 11 minutes until bottoms are *very* lightly browned.
Remove to wire rack to cool.  Store airtight up to 2 weeks or freeze.
