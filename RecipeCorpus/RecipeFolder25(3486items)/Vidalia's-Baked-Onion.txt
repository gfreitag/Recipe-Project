Title: Vidalia's Baked Onion
Categories: Vegetable, Side dish, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
4 lg Shittake mushroom caps,
-finely diced
4 oz Country ham, finely diced
4 tb Chopped chives
1    Ripe tomato, finely diced
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
4 lg Vidalia onions, whole with
-skins left on
8 tb Butter, softened
4 tb Brown sugar
8 tb Sherry vinegar
4 tb Beef glaze or bouillon
4 t  Chopped fresh rosemary
4 t  Chopped fresh thyme
Cut 1/4" from the bottom (rounded root end) of each onion. Score the
skin of each onion at 1" intervals, starting from the cut bottom and
upward to within 1/2" of the top. Pull the sections of onion skin
back and up over the top of each onion, like a tassel.

On a work surface, place four 12"-square pieces of aluminum foil.
Place a fourth of the butter, sugar, vinegar, beef glaze (or
bouillon), rosemary, thyme and diced mushroom in the center of each
piece. Top each with an onion and draw the foil from four corners to
the top center, like a pyramid. Crimp the foil around the "neck" of
the onion, leaving the "tassel" of onion skin exposed. There should
be a hole in the center.

Bake in a preheated 375'F. oven about 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until
soft. Transfer onions and mushrooms to serving plates, reserving the
juices.

Combine the cooking juices from all the onions in a saucepan and
gently heat with the ham, chives and tomato. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Pour 1/4 of the sauce over each onion and serve.
