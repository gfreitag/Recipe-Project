Name; Baked Chayote Squash with Cake and Raisin Filling

Cut the chayotes in half lengthwise and place them in a 2 to 3 quart
saucepan.  Cover them with cold water, and bring to a boil over high
heat.
Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer for 30 minutes, or
until the chayotes show no resistance when pierced with the tip of a
small, sharp knife.  Drain the chayotes in a large colander.  When
the chayotes are cool enough to handle, remove the seeds with a small
spoon. Then scoop[ out the pulp, leaving a layer of pulp about 1/8
inch thick intact in the shell. In a large mixing bowl, mash the pulp
with a fork until it is perfectly smooth.  Then beat in, a little at
a time, the eggs, sherry and ground nutmeg.  Add the raisins, sugar
and crumbled cake, and beat again. Then filling should have the
consistency of mashed potatoes and should hold its shape in a spoon;
if it seems too thin, add more cake crumbs.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  Fill the chayote shells with
the filling, mounding the top slightly, and dot with the almonds.
Arrange the shells side by side in a buttered baking dish and bake
for 15 minutes, or until the top of the filling is golden.
Serve the chayotes form the baking dish or arrange them on a
platter or on individual serving dishes.
