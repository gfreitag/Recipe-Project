Categories: Pork, Main dish, Marinade, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 servings
RED SAUCE:
1/3 c  Water
1 ea 14oz bottle Heinz ketchup
1 ea 12oz bottle Heinz chili
-sauce
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Dry mustard
6 ea Iowa pork chops
MARINATING SAUCE:
2 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Dark molasses
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Salt
Mix soy sauce, water, brown sugar, molasses and salt and bring to a
boil. Let cool. Put pork chops in a pan with the bone side up. Pour
marinating sauce over chops. Let stand in refrigerator overnight.
Next day, take chops out of sauce, place in a baking pan and cover
with foil TIGHTLY. Bake until tender in a 375 degree oven(about 2
hours). While chops are baking combine all red sauce ingredients in a
heavy saucepan or broiler. Mix dry ingredients and water together,
leaving no lumps. Bring all ingredients to a slight boil.  Red sauce
is done. After the chops are tender, remove them from oven and dip in
red sauce. Bake singly for 30 minutes at 350 degrees or until
slightly glazed. Serve now or keep chops at room temperature until
you are ready to put on charcoal grill, with grill as high as
possible for 15 minutes.  A little blacking does not hurt-BUT WATCH
CAREFULLY. Serve individually on serving plate or platter. Do not
stack (glaze is pretty) Submitted By STEWART HOPPER   On   12-23-94
