Title: Peachy Meat Loaf
Categories: Beef, Main dish, Meatloaf, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM----------------------------LOAF---------------------------------
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Celery seed
1    Onion, chopped or
1 tb Instant minced onion
1 1/2 lb Ground beef
1 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 c  Milk
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/4 c  Ketchup
2 tb Brown sugar
1    16oz peach halves, canned *
1/2 ts Cloves, ground
In medium bowl mix beef, bread crumbs, milk, egg, salt, pepper,
celery seed and onion.  Shape and place into a loaf pan. Bake at 350
F for 40 minutes. Mix cloves, ketchup and brown sugar, spread over
top of meatloaf. Place peach halves over top of meatloaf, pitted side
down. Bake another 20 minutes.

NOTE:  Made with dried onions.  Assembled and refrigerated for 1 hour
until ready to cook. (not necessary - just the way the day went)

Turned out very good. Sauce is not quite a barbeque sauce.  Peaches
add a nice touch.

* Next time I would use sliced peaches and arrange them on top of
loaf in herringbone design.
