Title: Jack's Easy Cincy Chili
Categories: Ground beef, Chili, Meat
Yield: 2 servings
MMMMM--------------------JACK WENTZEL FDGG51B-------------------------
3 c  Water
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1    Onion; finely minced
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
2 ts Cumin
1 tb Chili powder
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
2 lb Ground beef
15 oz Can tomato paste
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Vinegar
1 1/2 ts Ground allspice
Combine all ingredients in sauce pot.  Do NOT brown beef first!! Chop
up meat with fork as it cooks. Simmer 3 hours, coverd, stirring
occasionally. Meat shold be separated with fork while cooking, so
that it is very fine. Serve over pasta; top with chopped onion,
shredded COLBY cheese, kidney beans, oyster crackers, or any
combination thereof.
I've noticed a few recipes to replicate the "Cincinnati Chili"
recipe and coney sauce, and most seem to be really long, long, long
and complicated. Her is the one we use here in Ohio, and believe me,
it is IDENTICAL to Cincinnati Skyline Chili -- and VERY easy to make!
Let me know how you like it!!! MM Format Norma Wrenn npxr56b. From
