Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1/4 c  + 2 tbs brandy
1 2/3 c  Whipping cream, whipped
4 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
-coarsely grated
3 T  Cocoa powder
Extra whipping cream for
-garnish
6 ea Eggs, separated
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 1/2 c  Mascarpone cheese substitute
24 ea Lady fingers, split
-lengthwise
3/4 c  Hot water
2 t  Instant coffee granules
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Arrange half the lady fingers in the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan. Mix hot
water with coffee granules and 2 T. brandy. Pour 1/2 this mixture
gently over lady fingers. Set aside. Make a zablione by beating the
egg yolks and sugar in the top of a double boiler until ivory
colored. Add 1/4 cup brandy and whisk over simmering water until the
mixture starts to thicken - 8-10 minutes.  Let cool a little. Stir
constantly while cooking. Carefully mix zabliogne with mascarpone
cheese.  It will appear to be quite liquid. Whip the egg whites until
very stiff and fold into zabliogne/mascarpone mixture. Pour 1/2
zabliogne mixture over the lady fingers, which have been soaking up
the coffee/brandy mixture.  Top with 1/2 whipped cream. Sprinkle with
1/2 of cocoa powder and 1/2 of grated chocolate. Place balance of
lady fingers on top of this to create a second layer. Pour remaining
coffee mixture carefully over these lady fingers. Then repeat layers;
zabliogne, whipped cream, cocoa powder and grated chocolate. Cover
with plastic wrap and refrigerate till set. It is best if left
over-night. When ready serve, decorate with piped-on whipped cream
around the edges and more chocolate and/or cocoa powder if desired.
Yield 10-12 servings, depending on the size you cut them.  It is
quite rich so you might consider smaller sized pieces. NOTE:  You can
substitute Marsala wine for the brandy if you prefer and like the
taste of Marsala. >>> Continued to next message ++_ * SLMR 2.0 * ++-

SUBSTITUTE Mascarpone cheese is sold in Italian delis, cheese shops
and speciality food markets.  It is somewhat difficult to find and
very expensive (i.e. from Keywords: 9.95 per pound). From January
1991 Southern Living Magazine comes this substitute for mascarpone.
