*Unbaked pie crust dough can be wrapped well and frozen for several
months ++ in a ball shape, flattened into a disk or rolled out. A
ball of dough large enough for a standard crust will take about 3
hours to thaw at room temperature; a rolled out crust, 15 minutes.

* Baked or unbaked pie shells can also be frozen.  If baked, they
should be thoroughly cooled before wrapping and freezing. To Defrost
baked pie shells:  Unwrap and thaw at room temperature for 15 minutes
or in preheated 350 F. oven for 8 minutes. The oven method is
preferable, as it serves to recrisp and freshen flavor. To bake
frozen unbaked shells: Unwrap and place frozen shell in preheated 475
F. oven until golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. *Filled pies can
be frozen, preferably prebaked (the crusts of unbaked pies tend to
become soggy).  Two-crust pies generally give better results than
those with a single crust. Be sure to cool the baked pie thoroughly
before wrapping and freezing. To defrost baked pies: Let pie stand at
room temperature for 30 minutes, still wrapped. Unwrap and place in
preheated 350 F. oven about 30 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before
serving. From: Bon Appetit, Pies and Tarts Shared By: Pat Stockett
