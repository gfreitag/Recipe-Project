Title: Rosy Red Bean Ice Cream with Raspberry Sauce
Categories: Dessert, Ice cream
Yield: 8 servings
-- chilled
2 c  Adzuki bean puree
-- made from unseasoned
-- home-cooked beans
1 1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar; sifted
6 lg Egg yolks
2 c  Milk; scalded and kept hot
2 c  Heavy (whipping) cream
MMMMM----------------------RASPBERRY SAUCE---------------------------
2 tb Granulated sugar
1 tb Framboise, kirsch, or brandy
10 oz Frozen raspberries in syrup
-- thawed
In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat the sugar
with the egg yolks until light and lemon colored.  Reduce the speed
to low and add the hot scalded milk in a stream, beating until well
combined. Transfer the custard to a heavy medium saucepan and cook
over moderate heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until thickened
enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Strain the
mixture through a fine sieve into a metal bowl set in a bowl of ice
and let cool, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.

In a well-chilled bowl, beat the cream until it forms soft peaks.
With a rubber spatula, fold one-third of the cream into the bean
puree to lighten it, then gently but thoroughly fold in the remaining
cream. Fold the chilled custard into the bean mixture until
well-combined. Freeze in an ice cream freezer according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Serve with Raspberry Sauce.

RASPBERRY SAUCE: In a blender or food processor, puree the
raspberries, sugar, and framboise.  Strain the puree through a fine
metal sieve into a bowl, pressing down hard on the solids.  Serve
chilled or at room temperature.
