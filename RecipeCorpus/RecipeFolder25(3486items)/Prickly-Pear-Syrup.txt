Title: Prickly Pear Syrup
Categories: Native amer, Fruit, Syrup
Yield: 1 cup
1/4 c  Honey
12    Prickly pears
Wash and cut each prickly pear into quarters, leaving the skins on.

Place the fruit in a food processor and process until pulpy and
thoroughly blended.  Press the liquid through a fine sieve; discard
skin and seeds.

Put the prickly pear juice into a saucepan with the honey and bring
to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat and let simmer 10
minutes, until the mixture has thickened.  Remove from the heat and
let cool. The syrup will thicken further as it cools.  The syrup may
be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. ********************

Prickly pears have a sweet, tangy flavor that makes a delicious sryrp,
excellent with the Pinon and Blue Cornmeal Hotcakes and also a
wonderful topping for the Corn and Honey Pastel Ice or Picuris Indian
Bread Pudding.
