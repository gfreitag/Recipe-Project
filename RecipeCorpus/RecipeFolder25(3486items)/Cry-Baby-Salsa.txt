Hot Pepper Vinegar:

Dat'l Do-It Hot Pepper Vinegar is a great product by itself. However,
it comes in very small bottles.  Since we were continually "topping
it off," we decided to mix it in quantity.  The quantities specified
here are actually more diluted than the original product, so you may
choose to use the original formula directly.
