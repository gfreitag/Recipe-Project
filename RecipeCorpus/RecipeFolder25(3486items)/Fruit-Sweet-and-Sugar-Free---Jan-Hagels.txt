Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Jan Hagels
Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie, European
Yield: 3 dozen
3/4 t  Vanilla extract
2 c  White flour
1/2 c  Sliced almonds
1 c  Butter
2/3 c  Fruit sweetener
1    Egg, separated
1 t  Cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, lightly spray a 9 inch by 13 inch
rectangular baking pan with lecithin spray or line it with baking
paper. In a medium sized bowl, cream together the butter and
sweetener. When light and fluffy, add the egg yolk and beat for 1
minute. Stir in the cinnamon and the vanilla. When mixed, add the
flour. Use a rubber spatula to spread the dough evenly in the
prepared pan. In a small bowl, beat the egg white. Carefully brush
the surface of the dough with the egg white and sprinkle with the
sliced almonds. Bake until golden brown, approximately 25 minutes.
While the Jan Hagels are still hot, cut them into 1 inch diamonds.
Jan Hagels are quite fragile when still warm so it is best to let
them cool in the pan.
