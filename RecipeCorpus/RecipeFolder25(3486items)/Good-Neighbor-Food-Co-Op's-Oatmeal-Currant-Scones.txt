Title: Good Neighbor Food Co-Op's Oatmeal-Currant Scones
Categories: Bread, Fruit, Nuts/grains, Vegetarian
Yield: 12 servings
6 tb Cold butter
-- cut in 1/2" pieces
2/3 c  Currants
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk (approximately)
Half-and-half and sugar
-- for topping scones
2 c  Oats
2 c  Sifted, unbleached flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
Heat oven to 375 F.

Finely grind 1 cup of the oats in food processor. Blend in flour, 1/4
cup sugar, baking powder, soda and salt.  Add butter and, using quick
on-off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.

Put mixture in a large bowl.  Mix in currants and remaining 1 cup
oats. Make a well in center of mixture.  Gradually mix in enough
buttermilk to form moist dough.

Gently knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth, about
eight turns.  Divide into three pieces.  Pat each piece into 3/4"
thick round on floured surface.  Cut each into four wedges.

Brush with half-and-half and sprinkle with sugar.  Transfer to greased
baking sheet.  Bake until golden brown, about 28 minutes.  Serve hot.
