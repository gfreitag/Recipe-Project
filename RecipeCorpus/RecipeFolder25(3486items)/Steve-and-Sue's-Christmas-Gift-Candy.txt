Title: Steve and Sue's Christmas Gift Candy
Categories: Candy, Chocolate, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
Chocolate almond bark
White almond bark
Candy colors, optional
1 pk Ritz bits, peanut butter
1 pk Eagle brand pretzels
(the little "A" shaped ones)
Fill a crock pot halfway with water, turn on high, and put lid on
upside down. Cover a flat surface with waxpaper.  Chop up some bark,
and place the pieces in the upside down crockpot lid.   Go have a
brewski.  After you finish you brewski(es), stagger back to the crock
pot and, using a pair of tongs, dredge the Ritz Bits and/or pretzels.
Make sure each one is thouroughly covered with candy stuff and place
on wax paper to cool.
My wife likes to use Wilson's candy colors to color the white stuff
when we are using that- if you don't stir it in too well, you get a
nice attractive swirl look.  This also works quite well with fruits
and nuts and other things like that. (and it's lots of fun, too.)
