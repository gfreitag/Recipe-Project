This is one of my favorite recipes from The Firefighters cookbook,
compiled by John Sineno, one of New York's bravest and well fed!!
Brown sausage, ground meat, onion, and garlic in a pot. Add remaining
ingredients except beans, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer 1 1/4
hours. After cooking time is up, add the beans and stir. Top with
grated Monterey Jack cheese and finely chopped scallions. FROM:
