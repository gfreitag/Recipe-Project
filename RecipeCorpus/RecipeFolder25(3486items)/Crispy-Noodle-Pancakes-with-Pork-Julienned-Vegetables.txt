Cook the noodles (you can use any kind you like) in boiling

Topping: ========

Heat a little oil in a non-stick saute pan, and put a little
handful of the warm noodles into the bottom of it flattening the
noodles down into a "pancake." (The more noodles the bigger the
pancake so make the pancakes to the size the befits the appetite of
the gourmets in your family.)

While the pancake is cooking over low heat, julienne the
vegetables and slice the pork.

In second saute pan, put in a teaspoon of peanut oil and stir
fry the pork for a minute over high heat.

Add the julienned vegetables to the pork and stir fry for another
minute or two.

Add the bean paste, the salt, pepper, sugar and broth and stir.

Dissolve the cornstarch in a little cold water and add to the
stir fry cooking now to thicken and heat thoroughly throughout.

To Assemble: ============

When the noodle pancake is done and the stir fry is ready, turn
out the "pancake" onto a serving plate and slide the stir fried pork
and vegetables half on and half off the the noodles.

Garnish with a sprig of parsley, or a twist of orange, or a
radish rose and serve.
