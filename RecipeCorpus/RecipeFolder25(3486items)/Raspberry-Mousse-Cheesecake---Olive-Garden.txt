of water.) Combine gelatin with raspberry preserves.  Chill 10
minutes.

continue whipping until stiff peaks form.  Measure out 1-1/2 cups of
whipped cream for mousse and set aside.  Refrigerate remainder of
cream for topping. Gently fold raspberry mixture into measured
whipped cream.

Spread raspberry mousse on top of chilled cheesecake, mounding
slightly in the center.  Chill 1  hour before serving.

To serve, cut cheesecake into 6 servings and top each piece with a
dollop of reserved whipped cream.
