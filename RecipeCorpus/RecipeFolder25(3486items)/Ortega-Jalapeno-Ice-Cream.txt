NOTE---"It may never be a flavor of the month, but Ortega Jalapeno Ice
Cream is a frozen flame of flavors that teases the palate and keeps
you coming back for more. You can make this "hot" frozen dessert by
blending vanilla ice cream and finely chopped jalapenos. The end
product is a unique creation that will surprise you with a creamy
coolness that occasionally flares up with the fiery flavor of
chilies." "People expect the jalapenos to take over the flavor of the
ice cream," said Faye Egan, manager of the Nabisco Consumer Foods
Center. "While there are indeed moments when your mouth comes alive
with the pungent taste of peppers, most of the time the vanilla
flavor of the ice cream comes through." "This is a fun dessert," Egan
adds. "This idea of a hot and cold taste sensation in the same bowl
of ice cream is intruguing, and the two flavors happen to taste great
together." DESERT SUN NEWSPAPER-PALM SPRINGS, CA JUNE 25, 1992.
