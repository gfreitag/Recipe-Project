Title: Chou Farcie a la Correzienne
Categories: Main dish, Meat, Vegetable, French, Pork
Yield: 6 servings
100 g  Lard gras (pork back fat)
Oil/lard
Water/stock
1 md Savoy cabbage
1 md Onion, sliced
1 md Carrot sliced
MMMMM------------------------FOR STUFFING-----------------------------
Parsley
Crumb of 15 cm french bread
Milk
2 tb Cream
Pepper
1    Egg yolk (opt)
750 g  Mixed meats, raw/cooked
-including raw pork*
200 g  To 250g lard gras
1 sl Raw ham (bayonne type)
1 sl Cooked ham
1 md Onion, chopped
* NB.  As long as there's SOME raw pork, almost any combination of
pork, poultry and beef even can be used. Without cooked meat, use 1/3
pie veal and 2/3 lean pork. The lard gras should be 1/4 to 1/3 of
weight of lean meats.

Make stuffing. Slice bread, soak in milk, working in with fork. Drain
& work well. Chop all the meats together and mix with bread, parsley,
onion, pepper, cream and optional egg yolk - used if the meat is a
bit lean. If you have used ham and salted pork back fat, you won't
need salt.

Separate the leaves of the cabbage, carefully, and blanch them in
boiling water 5 minutes - refresh.

Using 1 or more leaves (depending on size) stuff each leaf with 1-2
tbs of stuffing, wrapping the leaves round to form a packet. Tie with
string.

Meanwhile, fry the remaining lard gras, sliced, in a little oil or
lard, in a large casserole until brown and all the fat has run. Fry
the cabbage packets a few at a time (cover bottom of pan) till well
browned on both sides. Fry the onion and carrot in the remaining fat
till softened. Return cabbage balls to pan and pour a little water or
stock over to half cover the lowest layer of balls. If you have used
ham and salted back fat, you won't need salt. Simmer, repositioning
the packets after half time, for about an hour, when the stock will
have reduced to a generous sauce. Submitted By IAN HOARE   On
