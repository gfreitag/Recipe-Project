1/4 ts Pepper, black
6 oz Rotini
2 tb Butter
2 c  Turkey; cooked, cubed
10 oz Spinach; chopped
Cook and drain pasta.  Melt butter in large skillet. Add turkey and
spinach; cook until thoroughly heated. Stir in soup, milk, garlic
powder, and pepper.  Cook, stirring constantly, until hot. Add pasta
and blend thoroughly.  Serve with Parmesan cheese.

Sylvia's comments: A keeper!  Fast and easy.  I used raw turkey
tenderloin and frozen spinach, cooked the spinach in the butter just
long enough to unfreeze it, added the cut-into-bite-sized-pieces
turkey, then added everything else until the turkey was cooked
through. I left out the garlic powder and pepper, so even Peter liked
it, and so did the kids. I used Vegelicious instead of milk. If you
used cooked turkey and pasta and already-thawed spinach, this would
be ready to eat in minutes.
