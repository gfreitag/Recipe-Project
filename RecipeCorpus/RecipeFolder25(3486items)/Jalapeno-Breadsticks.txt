Title: Jalapeno Breadsticks
Categories: Bread
Yield: 32 servings
1 1/2 t  Salt
6 ea Jalapeno chiles
- (fresh or canned)
- seeded, and chopped
1 c  Buttermilk
3 1/2 c  Bread flour
1 ea Tb Unsalted butter
1/2 md Onion; chopped medium fine
Cornmeal
2 t  Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1 1/2 t  Sugar
Saute onion in butter over medium heat until lightly browned.  Remove
from heat and set aside. Lightly grease three large baking sheets and
sprinkle them with cornmeal. Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a
mixing bowl. Let stand until yeast is dissolved, then stir in sugar,
salt, chopped jalapenos, sauteed onion, buttermilk and 2 cups of the
flour. Beat mixture well.  Stir in enough of the remaining flour to
make dough easy to handle. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
surface; knead about 5 minutes. Place in a large greased bowl, cover,
and let rise in a warm place until double, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
Punch down dough and divide into 4 equal parts. On a floured surface,
roll out one part dough to form an 8" x 8" square. Using a knife or
pizza cutter, cut the square into 8 equal strips. Place the strips
about 3/4" apart on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining
portions of dough. Let rise uncovered (1 hour or more for light, airy
breadsticks; 30 minutes for a denser, chewier texture). Bake in a
preheated 400oF oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
