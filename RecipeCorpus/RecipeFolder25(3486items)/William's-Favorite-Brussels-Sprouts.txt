Title: William's Favorite Brussels Sprouts
Categories: Vegetable, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Flour
1/4 c  Sour cream
2 c  Water
1 pt Brussels sprouts
2 c  Low fat milk
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
Remove the stems and any loose or wilted leaves from the Brussel
sprouts. Stab the tip of a paring knife into the bottom of each
sprout, cutting in about 1/2 inch deep.  Make another cut in each
sprout across the cut you've already made, forming a deep X in the
base of each sprout.

Pour the 2 cups of water in a heavy saucepan and bring to a gentle
boil. Add the sprouts and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes just until
tender. Do not overcook.

Drain set aside. Combine the salt, pepper, sour cream, flour and milk
into a cream sauce. Serve as a side dish.
