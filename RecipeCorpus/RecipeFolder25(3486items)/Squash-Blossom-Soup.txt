Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions and
garlic and saute until the onions are translucent.  Reduce the heat
to low, add the salt, pepper, and squash blossoms and saute 3
minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the stock,
bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat and serve hot, garnished with sprigs of chervil.

*** NOTE *** The wild onion grows throughout the Southwest during the
spring and summer. It thrives best in moist soil and can be found at
an elevati8on anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 feet.  It grows from a
basal bulb, the part of the wild onion that can be used like a
regular onion in cooking and sauteeing.  The leaf of the wild onion
is long and tubular, resembling a scallion or chive; it can be
chopped and used similarly. The wild onion also has flowers ranging
in color from white to pale pink, which are edible and make an
attractive garnish. *************************

This light, clear soup has a subtle, flowery taste that is quite
unusual. Serve it in the simmer when squash blossoms are readily
available. Plan to use squash blossoms the day you purchase or pick
them, as they tend to wilt easily and lose their delicate form and
flavor.
