Title: Pepperoni
Categories: Pork, Sausage, Beef, Homemade
Yield: 10 pounds
1 tb Crushed anise seed
1 ts Very finely minced garlic
1 c  Dry red wine
1/2 ts Ascorbic acid
1 ts Saltpeter
6    Feet small hog casings
7 lb Pork butt, cubed, fat includ
3 lb Lean beef chuck, round, or
-shank, cubed
5 tb Salt
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Cayenne
3 tb Sweet paprika
Grind meats separately through the coarse disk. Mix together with
remaining ingredients; spread out in a large pan, cover loosley with
wax paper and let cure in the refrigerator 24 hours. Prepare casings,
stuff and twist into 10" links. Using cotton twine, tie two separate
knots between every other link, and one knot at the beginning and
another at the end of the stuffed casing. Cut between the double
knots. This results in pairs of links. The pepper oni are hung by a
string tied to the center of each pair. Hang to dry for 6-8 weeks.
Once dried, the pepperoni will keep, wrapped, in the refrigerator for
several months.
