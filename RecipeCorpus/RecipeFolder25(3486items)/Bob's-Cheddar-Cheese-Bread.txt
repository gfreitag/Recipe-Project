"This rich bread is flecked with grated cheese.  If you're daring, try
adding 2 or 3 tablespoons of diced jalapeno peppers to it.  It's also
good toasted.  We have Bob and Melody Gabriel to thank for sharing
this gluten-free recipe."

Place all ingredients, except warm water, in bread pan, select Light
Crust setting, and press Start.  While the machine is kneading,
gradually pour in the water.  If the dough does not mix well, use a
rubber spatula to assist it occasionally.

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on wire
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.  1 1/2 pound loaf.
Optional bake cycles:  Sweet Bread, Rapid Bake.  (Nutrition info. not
