Title: Manuel's Seed Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 2 loaf
2 ts Poppy seeds
3 tb Sunflower seeds
1 1/2 c  Tepid water
3 c  Whole wheat bread flour
1 1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Sesame seeds
Combine all the ingredients except the water.  Make a well in the
center, pour in the water and mix into a slightly stiff dough, adding
more water or flour if necessary.  Knead well.  Keep the dough in a
covered container to protect it from invading critters, and in a
reasonably cool place (about 70 degrees)  Let it ferment for 12 - 18
hours, kneading it about two thirds of the way through the rising
time to refresh the dough.

When the dough feels dry (unsticky) and elastic, divide in two and
knead gently into rounds.  Let it rest protected from drafts for
another 30 minutes to soften,m then form into two small round loaves.
Sprinkle poppy seeds on the table and roll the loaf tops on them.
(Guessing this means additional poppy seeds)

Place in two greased one quart bowls or on a greased cookie sheet.
Put the shaped loaves into an oven preheated to 350 F without further
rising, and bake until done, about one hour and 15 minutes.  The
wheat colored crust will brown lightly.  Allow to cool completely;
slice thin.

This naturally leavened bread has a wonderful taste and dense but
bready texture.  It won't rise much in the bowl as it ferments, but
it may surprise you by springing in the oven.  The fermentation is 12
to 18 hours at room temperature, but on a cold winter day it may take
longer.
