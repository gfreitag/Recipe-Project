Title: Foolproof Sourdough Starter
Categories: Information, Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 999 servings
-skim, reg or buttermilk
1 c  Flour
1 c  Yogurt
1 c  Milk
Mix the milk and yogurt together in a glass, pottery or plastic
container.(NOT metal) Keep a lid on it, but don't seal it. (sealed
starters have been known to explode!)  Put this where the temperature
will be 80-90F for about 24 hours.  Then add the flour and put it
back in the warm place for 3-5 days. Stir it daily.  It will bubble
and have the odor of fermentation. It's ready to use.

A starter is a live thing and must be fed.  When you use it you should
replace what you used.  The amount you should replace will vary
according to need. If you use your starter often or you know you are
going to have a heavy demand soon, then you can put several cups of
milk and flour (equal measures) in it. Generally though you should
put in either 1/2 C to 1 C of both flour and milk.  I prefer to use
buttermilk, as it gives the starter a much stronger sour taste.  If
you are not going to use the starter for awhile, place it in the
refridgerator. It needs to be fed once a week...just a few spoons
flour or milk. If you forget and leave it in there for a long time
without food, don't just throw it out. Try first to bring it back by
adding 1/2c of flour and milk and leave out for a day or so. It is
remarkable how these things come back. Submitted By JOAN MERSHON   On
