Title: Kathy's Rum Balls
Categories: Candy, Holiday, Nuts/grains
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Powdered sugar
1 1/2 tb Lite Karo syrup
1 c  Finely chopped pecans
Ingredients:  1 cup vanilla wafer crumbs, 1 cup confectionery sugar,
dutch cocoa, and 1/4 cup or more of rum, bourbon or amaretta

Combine all ingredients. Using a teaspoon, measure out the dough and
roll into balls. Roll in the confectionery sugar and put into a
foil-lined tin.

Very simple ... I usually make up 2-3 recipes' worth at once and sit
them on the dining room table. Unfortunately, the temptation is to
have one every time I pass.

Hope you enjoy !
