1 c  Sliced, toasted almonds
*To make coffee syrup, brew 6 cups John Conti Gourmet Blend coffee.
Pour coffee into a small saucepan and simmer until reduced to 1/2
cup. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.

**Colombo's note: "Since it is no longer advisable to eat uncooked
eggs, I did not use the egg yolks.  The frosting was superb without
them and there was no problem with spreading.  However, if the
frosting seems too thick, add a small amount of water."

To make cake: Prepare coffee syrup.  Grease three 9" cake pans.  Line
with wax paper.  Grease wax paper.  Turn on oven to 350 F.

Sift together flour, soda, baking powder and salt; set aside.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream butter thoroughly.
Gradually add sugar.  Beat until fluffy.  Add unbeaten eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition.  Add coffee syrup to the
creamed mixture.

Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending
with flour.  (After each addition, stir with a wooden spoon just
until blended.)

Pour batter into prepared pans.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a
toothpick inserted near center comes out clean.  Cool cake in pans
for 10 minutes. Run a spatula around edge of pans.  Turn cake out
onto a cooling rack.

When completely cool, fill between layers with mocha filling.  Frost
top and sides of cake with mocha frosting.  Place sliced toasted
almonds around sides of cake.

To make frosting: In large bowl of an electric mixer, cream butter
thoroughly.  Add half the sugar and beat until light and fluffy.  Add
egg yolks and blend well.  Gradually mix in remaining sugar.  Add
coffee syrup and beat until well blended and very fluffy.

To make mocha filling: Combine frosting and almonds.  Mix well.  Place
between layers of cake.

from the John Conti Coffee cake contest held at this year's Kentucky
State Fair.

"First place went to Bessie Hulett of Shively."
