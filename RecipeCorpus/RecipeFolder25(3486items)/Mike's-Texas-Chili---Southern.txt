Brown pork and beef, and drain very well. Add all ingredients to large
crock pot and cover. Cook on high for 4 - 6 hours or low for 8 - 12
hours. The longer it cooks, the thicker it gets. Cubed roast or steak
may be substitiuted for the ground meat. NOTE: This can be cooked on
top of the stove. Brown pork and beef, then cook onions until they
become limp. Add all of the other ingredients first. Cook and mix for
