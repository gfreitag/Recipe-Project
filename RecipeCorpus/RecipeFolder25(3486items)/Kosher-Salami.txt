"This recipe makes real kosher salami if you have access to
kosher-butchered beef. If not, then just like kosher dill pickles,
it's the flavor that counts."

Grind the beef through the fine disk. Grind the ft through the coarse
disk. Mix the dry ingredients with the wine and pour this mixture
over the meat and fat. Mix well. Spread in pan and cure in the
refrigerator 24-48 hours. Prepare casings, stuff and tie off into
8-9" links. Hang to dry for one week. Wipe the sausage dry and smoke
over a cool (120) smoke about 8 hours. Increase smoking temperature
to 150-160 and smoke for an additional four hours. Because the
smoking aids in the drying process, the salami should be ready to eat
after about three weeks of additional drying.
