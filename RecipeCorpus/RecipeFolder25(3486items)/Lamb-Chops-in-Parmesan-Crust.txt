Jeffrey Nathan, owner chef of the New Deal Restaurant in New York
City, prepared the Easter dish, which is the restaurant's most
popular menu item. The recipe is far too good to keep for just once a
year.  You could easily cut it in half to serve at smaller get
togethers. 1/2 - 1 cup olive oil 16 rib lam chops all purpose flour
for dredging the chops 6 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 lb grated
paremsan cheese 1/2 cup butter 2 medium tomatoes, chopped 8 garlic
cloves, finely chopped 2 lbs spinach, thoroughly rinsed 1 tsp dried
rosemary leaves 1 tsp dried sage leaves salt and pepper to taste 2
lemons, cut into wedges, for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350F.  In a large skillet, heat 1/2 cup of the
oil over medium high heat.  Dip the lamb chops in flour to lightly
coat both sides; shake off any excess.  Dip the chops in the eggs and
then in the Parmesan cheese so that both sides are evenly coated.  A
few at a time, cook the chops for about 3 minutes on each side, or
until they are lightly browned. Transfer the chops to a roasting pan
that is large enough to hold them in a single layer.  Bake the chops
in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked the way you
like them, about 15-20 minutes for medium rare. In another large
skillet, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the tomatoes and
garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add th espinach
and herbs and cook just until the spinach is wilted, stirring
frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the lamb chops with
the spinach and garnish with lemon wedges. Makes 8 servings. Origin:
