Title: Microwave Divinity Candy
Categories: Candy, Microwave
Yield: 1 servings
2    Large egg whites
1/2 ts Vanilla
3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
2/3 c  HOT water
Combine sugar, corn syrup and water in 3 quart microwave safe bowl.

Cook on high for 12 minutes and 30 seconds. (Thin thread stage) Beat
egg whites until stiff, slowly beat in syryp, beating until mixture
loses shine.  Stir in vanilla.

Drop by teaspoon onto waxed paper.

I like these plain, but I know lots of people like chopped cherries
or nuts stirred in.
