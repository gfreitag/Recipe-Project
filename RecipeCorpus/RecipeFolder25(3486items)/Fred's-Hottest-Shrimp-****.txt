Fred Ferretti, who writes a regular column in Gourmet magazine, is
rumored to carry a flask of Tabasco sauce on his hip.  He insists
this is an exaggeration, but he has been known to shake droplets of
the pepper sauce even on dim sum.  Here's his recipe for shrimp with
a real kick.

======================================================================

In a small saucepan, combine the shrimp shells with the water and
boil for 10 minutes.  Remove the shells and reserve the stock.  In a
small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the shrimp stock with the Tabasco
sauce, catsup, salt and sugar; set aside.  Heat 1-1/2 tablespoons of
oil, add the bell peppers and saute for 1 minute, then remove the
peppers and set aside. Wipe the pan clean and add the remaining 2-1/2
tablespoons oil and the garlic and onion.  Cook over high heat for
about 4 minutes, or until the onion is softened and translucent. Stir
in the shrimp and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and mix well. The
shrimp should begin to curl. Add the reserved peppers and stir,
cooking for about 30 seconds. Stir the Tabasco sauce mixture and pour
it into the skillet, mixing all ingredients thoroughly. Remove the
pan from the heat and transfer the shrimp with the sauce to a warmed
serving dish.  Serve immediately with cooked rice.
