Wash the chicken and pat it dry inside an dout.  Place the lemon in
the cavity and place the chicken in a small roasting pan.  Cut one
clove of garlic in half and rub over the breast skin.

Bake the chicken for 20 minutes; add 1 1/2 cups both and bake for
another 20 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 354, add the remaining broth
and garlic and cook for another 30 to 40 minutes, basting every ten
minutes.  Remove the chicken from the pan and place it on a platter,
breast side down to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.

Pour the collected juices into a fat-skimming cup and defat.  With a
fork, mash the garlic.  Place the garlic and defatted juices back in
the roasting pan.  Over medium-high heat, reduce the juices by half,
stirring frequently.  Strain if you desire a smootehr sauce.  Carve
the chicken and pass the sauce at the table.
