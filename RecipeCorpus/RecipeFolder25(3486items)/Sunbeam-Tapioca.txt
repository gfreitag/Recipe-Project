Title: Sunbeam Tapioca
Categories: Dessert, Low-cal/fat, Fruit, Pudding
Yield: 4 servings
-- (canned), drained
1 c  Canned pineapple
-- (crushed or tidbits),
-- drained
3 tb Instant tapioca
1 c  Pineapple juice
1 c  Orange juice
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Mandarin orange sections
Combine the instant tapioca, pineapple juice, and orange juice in a
saucepan.  Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture comes to a
boil.  Remove from heat; add the lemon juice.  Cool, stirring
occasionally. Add the fruit and chill until firm.

HINTS: I used the 'packed in their own juices' tinned fruit, and so
used the juice from the tins plus some water and OJ to make up the
difference.

These are taken from "The McDougall Plan" and "The McDougall Program".
