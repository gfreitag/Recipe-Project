Title: Chocolate Almond Toffee
Categories: Candy, Holiday, Chocolate, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 batch
1 pn Salt
2 ts Pure vanilla, brandy or
-cognac vanilla
4    To 5 oz. semisweet choc.
-- melted
1 1/2 c  Whole almonds
-- blanched or unblanched
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
1 1/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Clear corn syrup
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
Spread almonds on a pastry sheet and place in a 160 F. oven for about
2 hours.  They must dry out and become crisp, but they should not be
toasted.

Combine the butter, sugar, corn syrup, cream of tartar and salt in a
heavy 2-quart or even larger saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Cover the
pan for 3 or 4 minutes to allow the steam to dissolve the sugar
crystals on the side of the pan.  Keep wiping the sides of the pan
with a brush that has been dipped in boiling water to remove the
sugar crystals or, better still, use a brush that has been dipped in
melted butter.

Boil, stirring gently, until toffee registers 300 F. on a candy
thermometer.  (If at any time the toffee seems to be darkening too
fast, place it over a flame tamer to prevent it from burning.)

Remove the toffee from the heat.  Allow the boiling to subside a
second or two, then stir in the vanilla or brandy.

Pour toffee over the almonds, stirring them about to cover them
thoroughly with the syrup; spread it out over the pastry sheet. Allow
toffee to cool. When the toffee has set, brush it with melted
chocolate. Cool and break into jagged pieces.  Store in a tin.

Yield: About 1 1/2 lbs.

To the wise: If the oven temperature is higher than 160 F., the
almonds will toast and brown, and this changes the flavor.

Glenn writes: "This toffee is delicious on its own, but with a coat of
chocolate it is marvelous."
