Peg...A roux is the first step in many sauces, gravies, gumbos, and
ettoufees. All it is is flour cooked in fat.  Some cook it very
slowly over low heat. Others, such as Paul Prudhomme, cook it very
fast. Either way, avoid burning the flour.  Some of Prudhomme's tips
follow: 1) Use a heavy skillet such as a cast iron one. 2) Use a
50-50 mixture of flour to fat. 3) Heat the oil to smoking before
adding the flour about a third at a time. 4) Stir or whisk
immediately and constantly (being very

careful to avoid burning yourself or the flour; Prudhomme refers to
it as Cajun napalm.) 5) If black specks appear in the flour, it has
burned and should be discarded. 6) If it appears the roux is
darkening too fast, remove from the heat and continue whisking until
you have it under control. 7) Depending on what you want to end up
with, you can produce a roux ranging from white (for that I wouldn't
start with oil heated to smoking) to light tan, to medium brown to a
dark, chocolate brown. 8) Keep whisking even after you remove the
roux from the heat because it will continue to cook for several
minutes and may burn.
