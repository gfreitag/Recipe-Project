Title: Crockpot Oatmeal
Categories: Nuts/grains, Breakfast, Crockpot
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Oats
Cook overnight. (really, that's all there is to it!!!)

Terry's comments: This is in response to the request concerning
cooking cereal in a crockpot. This technique not only works well for
oats but also polenta and other coarse cooked cereals.
