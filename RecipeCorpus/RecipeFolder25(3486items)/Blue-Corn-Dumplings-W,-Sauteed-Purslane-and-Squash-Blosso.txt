Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM--------------------SQUASH BLOSSOM SAUCE-------------------------
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
18    Blue Corn Dumplings
3 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Chicken stock
25    Squash blossoms, male or
-female

3 c  Purslane or watercress,

To make the Squash Blossom Sauce, combine the cream and stock in a
saucepan over medium-high heat.  Simmer 5 to 10 minutes, until the
mixture is reduced by half.  Set aside.

Wash and stem the blossoms.  If using male blossoms, remove stamens.
Place the blossoms in a steamer over enough water to reach the bottom
of the steamer.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, and
steam blossoms 4 minutes, until tender.

Process the squash blossoms and cream mixture in a blender until
smooth. Add the salt and pepper and blend 15 seconds.  Press through
a fine sieve to remove any pulp.  Gently reheat the sauce and keep
warm over lowheat until ready to serve.

Prepare the Blue Corn Dumplings.  While they are cooking, melt the
butter in a saucepan over medium heat, add the shallots, and saute
until translucent, stirring occasionally.  Add purslane and stir
until warm but not limp.

When the dumplings are cooked, remove from the heat and drain.

Spoon some of the Squash Blossom Sauce onto each plate and top with 3
dumplings and some fo the purslane greens.  Serve immediately.

Purslane (or verdolagas) is a wild plant whose succulent, fleshy
leaves are slightly tart and highly nutritions.  Watercress is an
acceptable substitute.
