1/2 c  Creamy peanut butter
1/4 c  Peanut oil
2 tb Dried onion bits
1    Clove crushed garlic or
Blend in a small pot over low heat:
Stir gently till bubbly don't burn the stuff.  Then allow to cool and
put in a small crock pot (the one you got left over from the school
PTA cheese sale) By the way this stuff will keep almost forever!  The
best medium to serve this disguised taste bud screamer is on Wheat
thins by (r) nabisco or triscut for the healthy nuts.

The really strange thing about this little trick is that it has three
different things that happen. First is that your taste buds get the
sweet from the honey. Second a mild taste of peanut butter. THEN
KABOOM *RED PEPPER!* I'LL SWEAR THAT THIS WORKS!  It should take from
a count of eight to ten seconds for the grenade to go off and you
oughta watch the faces of the UNSUSPECTED!
