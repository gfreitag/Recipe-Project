Yield: 12 candies
6 oz Semisweet or bittersweet

4 c  Unsalted roasted peanuts

This very rich Mexican candy is something like a giant peanut butter
cup made with dark chocolate and slightly grainy, freshly ground
peanuts. As the name indicates, it is a Mexican adaptation of
marzipan, substituting peanuts for ground almonds.

Grind peanuts fine in food processor. Add sugar and process into
compact paste. Divide into 12 equal pieces. In 2 1/2" diameter
ramekin, mold each piece into thick disk. Remove disks from mold
carefully.

Melt chocolate in double boiler and keep warm. Spoon 1 generous
tablespoon melted chocolate into wax paper. Carefully place 1 peanut
disk on top and move around to cover entire bottom of disk with
chocolate. Then enrobe top and sides with melted chocolate. Repeat
process to enrobe remaining disks. Place candies, still on wax paper,
in refrigerator until ready to serve.
