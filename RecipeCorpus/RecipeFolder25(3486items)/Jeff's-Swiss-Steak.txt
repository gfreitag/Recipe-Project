Title: Jeff's Swiss Steak
Categories: Meat, Main dish, Beef
Yield: 4 servings
28 oz Can whole tomatoes, drained
1/2 c  Onion, chopped fine
1/4 c  Green bell pepper, chop fine

Pepper, to taste
2 lb Round steak, tenderized

This is one of those "precious" recipes that my mother used to cook.

After tenderizing the round steak, dredge in mixture of the flour,
garlic powder and salt.

Brown the outside of the meat quickly in hot oil.

Add the onions, worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, tomato paste,
tomato sauce, and tomatoes (if desired.. chop as they cook).  Add
water if necessary to cover the meat.

Simmer covered for 2 hours on low heat.

Add the bell pepper and cook an additional 15-20 minutes.

Serve with mashed potatoes and rolls.

Bell pepper may be increased to 1/2 cup if desired.  (I do)

Enjoy! -  Jeff Duke
