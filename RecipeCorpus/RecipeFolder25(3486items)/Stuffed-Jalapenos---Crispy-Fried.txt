Categories: Tex/mexican, Vegetable, Appetizer
Yield: 12 servings
1    Bread crumbs
1    Flour
1    Deep fat for frying
12    Canned jalapeno peppers
1 pk Cream Cheese
1    Egg
1 c  Milk
Slice jalapenos in half, lengthwise, to remove the seeds and put
seeds in a bowl.  Mix 1/4 of the seeds with the cream cheese.  Stuff
the peppers with cheese and place in the freezer.  Combine milk, egg,
salt and pepper.
After jalapenos are frozen, roll in flour, dip in milk mixture and
roll in bread crumbs.  Dip again in milk mixture and once more roll
in bread crumbs.  Press the mixture firmly around the jalapenos and
return to the freezer until ready to fry.  At serving time, drop
frozen in deep fat, @ 325 degrees, until they are crispy and brown.
Serve HOT.

NOTE:  You might want to be careful with how you handle the peppers.
Wash your hands carefully before you touch your eyes or other
