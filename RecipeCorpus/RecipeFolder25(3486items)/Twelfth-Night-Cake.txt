Title: Twelfth Night Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Fruit, Nuts/grains, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
9    Eggs, separated
3 1/4 c  Flour
2 t  Mace
2 t  Cinnamon
3 lb Currants
1/2 c  Citron
1/2 c  Candied peel, cut into
- strips
1 lb Butter
2 c  Light brown sugar,
- firmly packed
2 t  Cinnamon
1 t  Baking soda
2 lb Seedless raisins
3/4 c  Almonds, blanched and
- chopped or cut into strips
In a large bowl, cream the butter and 1 cup of the sugar until light.
In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored
and add them to the butter-sugar mixture. In another bowl, beat the
egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold in a second cup of light
brown sugar and add this to the first mixture. In a bowl, sift the
flour, mace, cinnamon and baking soda; stir in the currants, raisins
and almonds. Add the flour-and-fruit mixture to the egg-butter-sugar
mixture. Combine the citron and candied peel and set aside.
Line two 12-in round pans with waxed paper, buttered on both
sides. Fill each pan 2/3 full, adding layers of citron and candied
peel. Cover loosely with buttered paper and tie into place. Steam the
cake for three hours and then bake it 1-1/2 hours in a slow oven (300
degrees) or bake it for 4 hours at 275 degrees without steaming. The
cake is done when it is firm to the touch and a wire cake tester
comes out clean and dry. Run a knife around the inside of the pan and
remove the cake when nearly cool. Frost with a thin white icing and
decorate with figures of birds, animals and flowers.
