Title: Mashed Potatoes with Herbs
Categories: Potato, Herbs/spice, Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Finely chopped chervil*
Salt and pepper; to taste
5    Potatoes (about 2 lbs.)
1 c  Thinly sliced onion
2/3 c  Milk
*While the recipe says you can substitute dried chervil, using 2/3
less the amount of the 1/4 cup, personally I think dried chervil
tastes like straw and I only make this in spring/early summer when
fresh chervil's in my garden.

Peel and quarter potatoes.  Put in a large pot; cover with cold
water. Add the onion and salt.  Bring to a boil and cook 20 minutes.
Drain. Beat in milk, butter, chervil and salt and pepper to taste.
