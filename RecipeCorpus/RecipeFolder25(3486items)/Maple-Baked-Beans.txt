water if necessary. Cut a slice from the salt pork and place in the
bottom of the bean pot. Add beans; place the onion in center of the
beans. Mix mustard, sugar, molasses, and maple syrup with bean
liquid; pour over beans. Cut 3 gashes in the remaining salt pork, and
place on top of the beans. Rind side up. Cover and bake 5 to 7 hours

pot the last half hour so pork rind will brown and become crisp.
Makes 6 servings.
