Title: Aggie Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Oregano or less to taste
POST-GRADUATE REFINEMENTS
(not in original recipe)
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
More or less to taste
1/2    Onion, finely chopped
2 tb Corn starch, dissolved in
1 c  Cold water
10    Chicken thighs, or cut up
Whole chicken or equivalent
3/4 c  Rose wine or what ever you
Have, type is not critical
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
2    Crushed garlic cloves or
Instant, not garlic powder
1 ts Ground ginger
1 tb Brown sugar
Bake at 350 for about 1 1/4 hrs or until done.  You shouldn't need
any salt because of soy sauce.  I haven't baked this in years and use
a pressure cooker instead.  On mine is done at 10 lbs pressure in
only 25 minutes. I like to thicken gravy with cornstarch after
chicken is done by removing chicken first then adding
water/cornstarch solution.  Don't add cornstarch directly to hot
sauce or you will have a mess. Dissolve in water first, add to gravy,
bring to boil while stirring. Need more gravy? No problem, double up
on wine/soy sauce mixture before cooking.  I almos always use a cup
or more of wine and a little more soy sauce.

SERVE OVER RICE.  Use long grain rice in 2:1 ratio such as 2 cups
water & 1 cup uncooked rice.  Bring salted water to boil and then add
rice & return to boil. Reduce to very low heat and cook 20-25 mins
after partially covering leaving air gap and watch out for boil-over
(I set about half off of burner).

I call this Aggie Chicken because it was a favorite and easy dish
which my roommates and I prepared while we attended Texas A&M
University and lived off campus.  The pepper flakes and onions were
not in the original recipe which I have adapted at home.

I have to have (frozen - Not canned) baby english peas to go with
this.
