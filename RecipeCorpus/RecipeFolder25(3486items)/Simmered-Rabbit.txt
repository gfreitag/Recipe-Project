Title: Simmered Rabbit
Categories: Game, Herbs/spice, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Flour
1/4 c  Oil (Canola oil)
1 tb Sugar
2    Rabbits (cut into serving
Size pieces)
1 c  Vinegar
1 cn Beer (12 oz)
2 lg Onions (sliced)
1 tb Mixed pickling spice
Marinate the rabbit pieces in the combined vinegar, beer, onions,
pickling spice, salt and pepper in a covered crock. Place in the
refrigerator for 1 or 2 days (I prefer 2 days) and turn the meat
several times. To Cook: Dry the rabbit pieces with paper towels. Dip
the pieces in flour and brown on all sides in oil using a Dutch oven
or deep frying pan. Pour off the oil. Strain the marinade, add sugar
and pour over the rabbit pieces. Bring to boiling point. Cover and
simmer over low heat for 40 minutes or until rabbit is tender. Add
1/2 cup white wine to the gravy and thicken. Submitted By HELEN
