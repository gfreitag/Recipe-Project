Title: Frozen Fudge Popsicles
Categories: Snack, Kids, Chocolate
Yield: 10 popsicles
2 tb Sugar
3 c  Milk
1 pk (3 3/4 oz) Chocolate Fudge
Pudding & pie filling.
Combine the pudding mix, sugar and milk in a saucepan. Cook over
medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a full
boil. Remove from the heat and cool 5 mins. stirring twice. Place in
the freezer about 30 minutes to cool and thicken. Spoon the mixture
into the 10 three oz paper cups and insert a wooden popsicle stick or
plastic spoon into each cup. Cover each cup with foil after cutting a
small hole just large enough to poke stick or spoon handle through.
The foil helps to position the sticks upright and will keep the
popsicles from dehydrating. Freeze until firm. Cut away the paper
cups before serving. Submitted By NANCY O'BRION   On   10-30-94
