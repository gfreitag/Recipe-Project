Categories: So. america, Pumpkin, Dessert, Pudding
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Salt
3    Egg; lightly beaten
1 c  Pureed pumpkin; freshly
;cooked or winter squash, or
;canned pureed pumpkin
1 1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
1/4 ts Orange peel; freshly grated
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  In a large mixing bowl,
combine the milk, brown sugar, orange peel, ginger, cinnamon and
salt. Stir thoroughly, then add the lightly beaten eggs and the
pureed pumpkin. Beat vigorously with a spoon until the mixture is
smooth, and pour it into a 1 quart shallow greased baking dish. Place
the dish in a large pan in the middle of the oven and pour enough
boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the baking
dish. Bake the pudding for about 1 1/4 hours, or until a knife
inserted in the center of the pudding comes out clean. Remove the
dish from the water and either cool the pudding to room temperature
before serving or refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until
thoroughly chilled. If you like, the pudding may be made in six 4
ounce porcelain or glass molds; in that case bake it for about 40
minutes, until firm.
