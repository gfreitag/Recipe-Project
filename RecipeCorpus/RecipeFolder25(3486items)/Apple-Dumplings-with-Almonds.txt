Line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper.  Make the dough.  Put all
the dough ingredients into a bowl and work together into a smooth
dough.  Set aside in the fridge to rest for at least 1 hour.

Peel and core the apples.  Prick the apples with a cocktail stick or
needle.  Brush with a little of the brandy and roll in the chopped
almonds.

Grate the almond paste, add the remaining brandy and mix together
until smooth.

Preheat the oven to 200øC/400øF/Gas Mark 6.  Roll out the dough to
form a square approximately 30 x 30cm/12 x 12 inches.  Cut the square
into 4 pieces.  Put one apple on each square.  Fill the centres with
the almond paste mixture.  Brush the dough edges with beaten egg.
Fold the four corners over the apples and pinch the edges together to
form a parcel. Put the apple dumplings on the prepared baking sheet,
brush with egg and sprinkle with the remaining chopped almonds.  Bake
for 20-25 mins.  Test with a fork or skewer to see if the apples are
fully cooked; hard apples with take longer.  Cover the dumplings with
foil if they get too brown during baking.
