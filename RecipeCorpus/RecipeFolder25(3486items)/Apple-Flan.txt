++++ TO MAKE THE CRUST: Mix the flour and sugar in a medium-sixed
bowl. Cut in the butter and 2 Tbls of solid vegetable shortening with
a pastry blender or 2 knives, until the mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Sprinkle the water ligthly over the flour mixture, 1 tb at a
time. (NOTE: Up to 4 Tbls of water may be used.) Stir lightly with a
fork after each addition to distribute the moisture evenly. Press
lightly to form a ball. Flatten into a 1-inch thick circle and wrap
in plastic; refrigerate for about 1 hour or until firm enough to
roll. Place the oven rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400
degrees F. (205 degrees C.). Have a 9-inch tart pan with a removable
bottom ready.  On a lightly floured surface, with a lightly floured
rolling pin, roll the dough out to an 11-inch diameter circle. Line
the bottom and sides of the tart pan with the dough, then prick all
over with a fork.  Press a 12-inch piece of foil snugly into the tart
shell. Bake 10 minutes or until the shell is set but not browned.
Remove the form from the oven and carefully lift off the foil.
Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. (180 degrees C.).
Lightly beat the egg whit in a small bowl with a fork until slightly
foamy.  Brush over the bottom and sides of the shell.  Bake 1 minute
to set the egg white.  Cool to room temperature on a wire rack. TO
MAKE THE FILLING: Arrange the apple slices, slightly overlapping, in
apinwheel fashion to cover the bottom of the tart shell. Whisk the
cream, sugar, eggs and vanilla in a medium-sized bowl until well
blended.  Carefully pour over the apples. Bake 40 to 45 minutes at
350 degrees until the custard is set and the edges of the apples are
lightly browned.  Cool slightly in pan on a wire rack. Meanwhile in a
small saucepan, stir the preserves over low heat until melted.
Strain, then brush evenly over the apples. Cool to room temperature
and remove the tart rim before serving.
