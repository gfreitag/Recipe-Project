Title: Roast Chicken Ii
Categories: Chicken, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper; to taste
Tarragon*
1    4 to 5 lb. chicken
-- (I used 5 lb.)
*My addition.

Unwrap chicken; remove giblets from cavity.  Thoroughly rinse chicken,
inside and out.

Put bird on roasting pan with shallow sides (no higher than 1"), put
in oven and bake 30 minutes at 450 F.  (High temperatures sear the
bird's outside, crisping the skin but keeping the meat inside moist.)
(I just used a regular roasting pan, without a lid.)

Reduce heat to 400 F.  Bake 15 to 25 minutes more (I baked it 25
minutes), or until thigh meat registers 160 F. on a meat thermometer
or juices run clear when poked with a fork.

Remove from the oven.  Let stand 10 to 20 minutes before carving.

Serve with baked potatoes and green beans or a salad.  (I put baked
potatoes and 1 small quartered onion in with the chicken.  New
potatoes would be good, too.)

My notes: This recipe is ultra-easy, good and quick.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
