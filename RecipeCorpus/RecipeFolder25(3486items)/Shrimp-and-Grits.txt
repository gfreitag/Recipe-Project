garlic. Season with nutmeg and a dash of tabasco, salt and pepper to
taste. Serve over grits. Garnish with the parsley.

To make the grits, bring water and salt to a boil. Gradually add
grits and stir.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add
cheese, stirring until melted, then add tabasco and pepper to taste.
