Capote's "A Christmas Memory"

Sook, a teetotaler herself,  got the bourbon whisky from an Indian
bootlegger who operated a "place of sin".  During Prohibition she had
to settle for moonshine corn whisky made by a full-blooded Apache
(who, some said, also ran a whorehouse).  The account of this small,
frail woman doing this in order to turn out a fruitcake is, by
today's convention, remarkable (right, Scarlett?). Converted by
