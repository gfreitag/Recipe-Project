Title: Maple Buttercream Frosting
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Syrup
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Milk
Cream butter and
-shortening.  Add maple
-flavoring.
g  Add powdered sugar.
-Gradually add milk and
1/2 c  Crisco shortening (regular
-only)
1/2 c  Butter, softened
1 t  Maple flavoring (like
-vanilla extract)
4 c  (1 lb.) powdered sugar
continue beating until light and airy.  Add more milk if needed.
Color with paste colors. This icing is a light yellow and colors you
add will be affected by this.  For pure white icing, use 1 cup
regular Crisco shortening and 1/2 tsp. Wilton butter flavoring. This
icing is somewhat stiffer.  For blazing white, add Wilton White
White. Wilton White White will also make the first buttercream recipe
whiter, but be careful with colors as they will still tend to be
yellowish. (I have never worried about the frosting color nor have I
ever used food colorings on it. Natural looks fine to me but I left
in the last paragraph in case it matters to you.) Posted by:  Debbie
