Title: Lang's Crunchy Peanut Butter Fudge
Categories: Candy
Yield: 12 servings
1 ea Jar of marshmallow cream
1 ea Jar of crunchy peanut butter
2 lb Sugar, powdered
1/4 lb Butter
1 cn Evaporated milk
Combine sugar, butter and milk in a large, heavy pot.  Bring to a boil
stirring constantly.  Be very careful not to burn!!!  Cook until
mixture forms a firm ball when tested in cold water.  About 15
minutes of boiling. Remove from heat and add the marshmallow cream
and the peanut butter and mix thoroughly.  Turn into a 9x12 buttered
pan and allow to partially set. cut into serving size pieces and
allow to fully set. This is the original recipe.  Adding an extra jar
of peanut butter still makes an excellent fudge which is more peanut
buttery and less sweet. Submitted By LAWRENCE KELLIE   On   11-12-94
