If bread machine typically uses 2 cups flour, use small loaf recipe.
If machine uses 3 cups flour, use large loaf recipe.

Follow manufacturers direction for loading ingredients into machine.
Measure ingredients carefully.
I baked the large loaf from this recipe.

***I had to add two additional tablespoons of flour to this dough to
get the proper consistency.

I warmed liquids in microwave before pouring them into the bread pan.

This was done in a Hitachi 101, and the loaf came just over the top
of the breadpan, but did not hit the lid.  Nicely formed loaf.

Remember to check the texture of the dough during the kneading to see
if it is too moist.

Next time I will add a bit less liquid and probably omit that extra
two tablespoons of flour.

Per slice:  Large loaf-12 slices   Small loaf-8 slices
