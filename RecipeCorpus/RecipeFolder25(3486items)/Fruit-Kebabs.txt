Title: Fruit Kebabs
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 8 kebabs
2 c  Papaya; cubed, (1 papaya)
2 c  Watermelon; cubed
16    Strawberries; hulled
8    12-inch wooden skewers
1 1/2 c  Fresh pineapple; cubes
8    1/2-inch kiwi slices (2)
Thread an assortment of fruit on each skewer with a strawberry at
either end.  Serve chilled.

This is an appetizing way to serve fruit--one that will appeal to
youngsters as well as to adults.  I like to serve fruit kebabs
garnished with lime wedges at breakfast, along with spiced bran
muffins right out of the oven.  They also make great snacks or a
healthy dessert.
