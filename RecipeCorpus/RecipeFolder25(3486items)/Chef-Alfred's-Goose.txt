Title: Chef Alfred's Goose
Categories: Game, Poultry, Herbs/spice, Main dish, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Sage or poultry seasoning
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2 tb Fat
1/4 c  ;Water
Flour for dredging
1    Wild goose; dressed
;(6 to 8 lbs.)
2 lb Potatoes
Goose liver; chopped fine
2 md Onions; chopped
1 tb Butter
1/2 ts Thyme
Clean and dress goose; wash in cold water, being sure that cavity is
clean. Let stand in cold water for at least 1 hour before cooking.
For the stuffing, boil potatoes in salted water with their jackets
on. After they have cooked, peel and mash while hot.

Lightly saute the goose liver and chopped onion in butter.  Add to the
mashed potatoes, together with the herbs, salt and pepper. (You can be
generous with the pepper, as the stuffing is best if very hot.) Spoon
stuffing into the cavity of the goose and sew with cord and skewers.
Do not overstuff.

Place on a rack in an uncovered baking pan; baste with the fat.  Add
water and bake at 350 F. for 2 hours, basting frequently.  In the
last half hour, dredge the breast with a small amount of flour. Baste
again with the hot drippings so the skin will get crisp and brown.

Serve hot with applesauce.
