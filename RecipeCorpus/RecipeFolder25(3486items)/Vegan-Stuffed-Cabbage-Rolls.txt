To prepare the cabbage:  Place the cabbage in the freezer for a
couple of days.  Remove and allow to defrost completely.  When the
cabbage has defrosted, the leaves will be limp.  Carefully remove the
leaves to fill.

Filling:  In a skillet, heat the oil and add the onion, celery and
green pepper.  Mix in the seasonings.  Add vegetables to rice and mix
well. Set aside.

Sauce:  Heat the oil in a an 8-quart pot.  Stir in the flour and cook
until brown, stirring continuously.  Add remaining ingredients in the
order listed.  Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the
cabbage rolls carefully, placing them in the sauce one at a time.
Cook on low heat for 2 hours, adding more water if necessary.

To fill the cabbage leaves:  Place a tablespoon of filling on the rib
of the leaf, near the base.  Fold the base of the leaf over the
filling and roll once.  Fold sides toward the center to enclose and
make straight edges.  Continue rolling until completed and place seam
side down into the pot (you can fasten the roll with a plain wooden
toothpick if you need to). Submitted By HILDE MOTT   On   12-09-94
