TO MAKE THE SAUCE: Heat tomatoes and crush with a potato masher.
Brown the ground beef and add to the tomatoes.  Saute onions and
garlic and add to the sauce.  Add tomato paste.  Fill used tomato and
tomato paste cans with water and add to sauce.  Blend well and bring
to a boil. Brown pork cutlets and add to sauce, along with remaining
ingredients. Add meatballs and simmer for 3 hours, or longer until
thick. TO MAKE THE MEATBALLS: Mix all ingredients together (a dough
hook is helpful) and roll into balls. Brown meatballs on all sides
and add to sauce. TO MAKE THE SPAGHETTI: Slowly add pasta to boiling,
salted water.  Cook until al dente, drain and rinse with hot water.
Add some butter, or olive oil after rinsing to prevent sticking
together. Origin: Old Farmer's Almanac, Hearth and Home Companion for
