----------- SOUP ----------
2 c  Bean Mix, washed
7 c  Any well-flavored vegetable
- or chicken stock, or water
1. In a large heavy soup pot, soak the beans in stock or water to
cover overnight. (If using chicken stock, refrigerate)

2. The next day add enough of the remaining stock or water to cover
the beans by 1 or 2 inches.  Add the soup bone if using, the bay
leaf, and chili.  Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to very
low and let simmer, covered, until the beans are tender, 1 to 3 hours
depending on the type of bean.

3.  Add the remaining ingredinets except the parsley.  Simmer,
covered, until vegetables are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

4.  If using the suup bone, take it out, bick off any meat that
clings to the bone, and return it to the soup.  Take out the bay leaf
and chili. mash a couple cups of beans against the side of the pot
with a wooden spoon to thicken the soup slightly.  Serve hot,
garnished with the parsley. This suop is even better the next day.
