The vegetables for this dish should be "chunky" rather than "leafy".
Some suggestions are fresh mushroom slices; scallions(white part),cut
in 1/2" diagonals; sweet red peppers, seeded and cut in 1" cubes;
sweet green peppers, cut the same way; water chestnuts, sliced; or
snow peas, cut in thirds. Use no more than 1/2 cup of any one.  You
may also include fruit if you don't use the plum sauce. Suggestions
are peeled mango, cut in 1/2" pieces; pineapple chunks; Ginger
Pickle; or melon chunks. If any of these are canned, rinse off the
syrup. This would give you 3 or 4 vegetables and one or two fruits, a
good combination.

1. In small bowl, combine corn starch, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and
sesame oil. Marinate cut chicken in this for 1/2 hour.

2. Heat wok over high heat for about 1 minute. Add 1 T peanut oil and
coat wok. Add the vegetables one at a time. The order isn't important
except for melon (if used) which should be added after the others
have cooked. Stir-fry the vegetables for about 1-2 minutes. Turn off
heat and reserve.

3. Wash and dry wok. Heat for 1 minute. Add 1 T oil and coat wok. Add
minced garlic and stir-fry till light brown. Add chicken with
marinade in a layer and cook for about 1 minute, then turn over and
cook other side fo the same time.

4. When chicken turns white, add vegetables and stir-fry all for
about 2 minutes.

5. Make well in center and add the chosen sauce. Stir-fry all
together for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until sauce thickens. Serve
immediately.
