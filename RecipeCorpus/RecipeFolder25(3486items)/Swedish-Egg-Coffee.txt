Anytime is coffee time in Lindsborg, Kansas, a town which has been
called more Swedish than Sweden.  Local resident Nancy Peterson gave
us the following recipes.  "This coffee is clear and has no bitter
taste," she told us.  "It reheats well.  Most people drink it black
and brew it in an enamel pot or saucepan." 1/3 cup ground coffee 1
egg 1 tbsp water 8 cups water, plus 1/2 cup

Beat coffee and egg into a sludge with 1 tbsp of water.  Bring 8 cups
of water to a boil.  Add the sludge and simmer for 7 minutes.  Remove
from the heat and add 1/2 cup cold water to settle the grounds.
