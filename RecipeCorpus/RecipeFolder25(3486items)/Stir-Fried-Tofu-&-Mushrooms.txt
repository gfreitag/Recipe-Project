If using regular tofu, it will need to be pressed & diced.  If using
deep-fried, dice it.  Then, marinate the tofu for 5 minutes.  Remove &
reserve the marinade.

Trim the mushrooms & quarter the caps.  Heat the vegetable oil in a
wok over high heat.  Fry the tofu until it begins to change colour.
Turn over & fry the other side, be careful not to break it.  (If
using deep-fried tofu, it won't need as long for cooking).  Remove
tofu & saute garlic. Stir-fry until it begins to brown.  Add the
mushrooms & stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the marinade & stir-fry
for a couple of minutes. Return the tofu to the wok with all the
seasonings plus 1/4 c water. Cook for another 5 minutes. Add the
green onions, cook 15 seconds & serve hot.
