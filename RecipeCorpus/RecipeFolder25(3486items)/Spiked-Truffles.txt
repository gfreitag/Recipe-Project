Title: Spiked Truffles
Categories: Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 7 dozen
-whole eggs
2 tb Brandy
1 ts Vanilla
Glace cherries (optional)
Chopped nuts (optional)
10 oz Semisweet chocolate
-10 squares
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
-2 squares
1/2 c  Butter; softened
8 oz Reduced-cholesterol liquid
1.  Line 2 large baking sheets with foil.  Combine semisweet and
unsweetened chocolate in top of double boiler set over hot, not
boiling, water; stir occasionally until melted and smooth.

2.  Add butter, liquid eggs, brandy and vanilla, beating with wire
whisk or fork until smooth.

3.  Place mixture over ice-water bath and chill 5 to 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until frostinglike consistency but still
smooth and creamy (consistency will be similar to butter cream
frosting).

4.  Spoon chocolate mixture into pastry bag fitted with a large, fine
star tip.  Pipe 1-inch diameter candies onto prepared baking sheets.
Repeat with any remaining mixture in top of double boiler, whisking
occasionally if mixture tends to harden.  Decorate with glace
cherries and nuts, if you wish.  Refrigerate for several hours or
until hard enough to loosen from sheet and handle.

5.  Store candies in tightly covered tin in the refrigerator for up
to 1 week.  Let come to room temperature to serve.  Truffles can be
frozen between sheets of wax paper in tightly sealed container for up
to 1 month.
