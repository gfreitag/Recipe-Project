saucepan, heat vinegar until hot, but not boiling. Pour hot vinegar

(Vinegar will corrode the metal.) Carolyn's note: Plastic lined metal
caps are fine. Let cool completely, then cover tightly. Let vinegar
stand in a cool, dark place for 1 week. After one week, remove herbs
from jar. Transfer vinegar to a clean 1 1/2 pint bottle. If desired,
add a sprig of fresh herbs to the bottle for easier identification.
Cover tightly, label and place in a cool dark place up to 6 months.
