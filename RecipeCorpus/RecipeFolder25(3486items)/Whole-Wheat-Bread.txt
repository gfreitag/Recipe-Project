Title: Whole Wheat Bread
Categories: Bread, Potato
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Mashed potatoes, without
-milk, or seasonings
2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 1/2 c  Bread flour
Melted butter for brushing
-of loaves
2 ea Envelopes active dry yeast
3 T  Granulated sugar
3 T  Brown sugar or honey
1 T  Salt
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
In a large mixer bowl, combine all of the ingredients in the order
given, but reserve 1-1/4 cups of bread flour.  Mix well for 5
minutes. Gradually blend in the rest of the bread flour, using as
much as needed to make a workable dough.  Transfer to a floured
surface, or use your electric mixer dough hook, and knead for 10
minutes.  Place dough in a greased large bowl (use either white
vegetable shortening or butter), cover with a towel and allow to rise
in a warm place until dough doubles in size, approximately 2 hours.
Punch dough down very thoroughly to break up any large air holes that
might have developed. Form into a smooth ball and place in the
regreased bowl.  Allow dough to rise until it doubles again in size,
approximately 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down again, cut in half, and
form into 2 loaves.  Place loaves in greased (8-1/2 x 4-1/2 x 2-3/4
inches) loaf pans.  With a dinner fork, prick each loaf 8 times,
plunging the fork all the way down to the bottom of the pan; this
keeps those nasty air bubbles from forming. Cover the loaves with a
towel and let rise until they are double in size, approximately 1-1/2
hours. Preheat oven to 325 F. Bake the loaves for 15 minutes, then
raise the temperature to 350 F. and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer.
Remove pans from oven, brush tops of loaves liberally with melted
butter, and tip the loaves out of their pans onto a wire rack to
cool. This keeps the loaves from getting soggy from their own steam.
