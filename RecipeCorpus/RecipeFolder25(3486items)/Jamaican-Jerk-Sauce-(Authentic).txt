Another dish you could try is Coconut Shrimp.  Just deep fry some
shrimp in a batter to which you've added some shredded coconut.  A
good dipping sauce would be crushed pineapple with a couple of good
dollops of a West Indian Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce, like Matouk's or
Mabel's or Hak Has. To soak up the heat, serve some fried plantains
and rice, and plenty of Red Stripe.
