Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
2 tb Oil
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Flour; to 3c --whole wheat
1 tb Butter; melted
1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
1 ts Brown sugar
1 c  Warm water
1 lg Egg
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
6 c  Shredded raw cabbage;
-tightly packed
1/2 c  Fresh parsley; chopped
3 ea Hard boiled egs; chopped
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Onion; chopped
2 tb Butter
8 oz Mushrooms; fresh, coarsely
-chopped, optional
1/2 ts Dill weed; to 1t
In large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let sit
about 5 mins or until surface is bubbly.

Combine egg, oil, and 1 1/2t salt and stir into bubbled yeast
mixture. Add flour by the half cutp, stirring vigorously, until the
dough is fairly stiff.

Turn out onto a floured board and knead for a full 10 mins.  Place
dough in a greased bowl, cover lightly, and put in a warm place to
rise until doubled in bulk.

In a large covered skillet, saute onion in 2T butter.  When onions are
transparent, add mushrooms if desired and saute until tender.

Add dill weed, cabbage and parsley.  Stir to combine.  Reduce heat,
cover pan and simmer until cabbage is tender but not soft, about
15-20 mins. Lightly stir in hard boiled eggs and 1t salt.

To assemble, punch down dough and divide into 2 equal parts.  Roll
out the first part into a rectangel about 10x14 inches.  Place on a
baking sheet.

Mound the filling onto the rolled out dough, leaving a 1 1/2" margin
all around.  Roll out the remaining piece of dough to same size and
place over filling.

Crimp upper and lower margins together, twisting a little to give a
braided rope look.  Cut three slits in the top to let steam escape.
Let rise in a warm place for another half hour.

Preheat oven 400.  Bake for 20 mins, then brush with melted butter.
Reduce heat to 350 and bake another 10 mins.

Helpful hints:  Serve with low far sour cream.  If you have a scrap
or two of extra dough, form into a few pretty leaf shapes to decorate
top of pie. Posted by Lisa Greenwood
