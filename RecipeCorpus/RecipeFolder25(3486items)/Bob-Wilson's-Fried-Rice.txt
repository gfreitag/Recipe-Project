Title: Bob Wilson's Fried Rice
Categories: Rice, Vegetable, Stir fry, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings  NOTE: Do not turn down heat, cook on FULL heat.

You need normal long grain rice, I personally use Jasmine rice as I
like the taste.  Wash the rice very well in running water, bring a
pan full of water to the boil, add one teaspoon of salt and a couple
of shakes of cooking oil, add the rice, slowly bring back to a boil,
then boil for *exactly* ten minutes, drain and leave to cool, not in
the fridge.

When COLD add a couple of level teaspoons of paprika to the rice and
mix in.  Chop some scallions (spring onions) and beat a couple of
eggs. Bring a wok to smoking hot, add one tablespoon of oil, fry any
meat you wish to use, remove from wok, add more oil & fry onion for a
couple of minutes. Remove from wok, lightly oil the wok and fry egg
until just set, fry it like an omlet, remove from wok.

Wash wok, add two tablespoons of oil to very hot wok and a dash of
Sesame oil, heat until smoking.  Add rice, cook until heated through,
stirring all the time.  Add meat & onion, cook a while then add a
couple of dashes of superior soy sauce (light soy sauce) stir and add
the egg, stir and chop until mixture is hot and egg is in pieces.

Serve and enjoy.  I use this method every time I make fried rice and
it turns out as it should *every* time, I have also cooked Chinese
food for others and they have said I make some of the best Chinese
food in town. I even have some regular customers who even pay for it!

I hope this is of help and your next batch of fried rice is to your
liking, let me know what you think when you have tried it.
