Title: Tangy Mustard Basil Chicken
Categories: Low-cal/fat, Chicken, Poultry, Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 ts Basil leaves
1/16 ts Pepper, black
4    Chicken breasts, boneless
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Yogurt
1/4 c  Honey
1 1/2 tb Dijon mustard
Combine buttermilk, yogurt, honey, mustard, basil, and pepper in 2-qt
rectanglar baking dish; mix well.  Place chicken in marinade, coating
both sides.  Cover dish with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.
Turn chicken occasionally.

To grill, coat grill with cooking oil.  Remove chicken from marinade.
Cook directly over medium-hot coals for 15-20 minutes; turn
frequently. Brush several times with marinade. Chicken is done when
juices run clear when chicken is pierced with a fork.  Serve
immediately.

To bake: Preheat oven to 375.  Remove chicken from marinade. Place
chicken breasts on baking sheet.  Coat generously with marinade. Bake
20-25 minutes, or until juices run clear when chicken is pierced.

Sylvia's comments:  I had turkey tenderloins, so used them instead of
the chicken.  It was too hot to bake, so I poached them in the
marinade. Very tasty and easy, and the kids had four servings each. I
also think the marinade would make a great sauce for vegetables,
although I didn't have anything handy to try my idea on.
