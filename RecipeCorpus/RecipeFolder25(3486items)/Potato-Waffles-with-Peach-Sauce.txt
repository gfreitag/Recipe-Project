POTATO WAFFLES: Heat a waffle iron and lightly coat the grids with
nonstick spray.  Sift the flour, baking powder and allspice into a
large bowl. In a medium bowl, combine the milk, egg substitute and
honey. Stir in the potatoes and hazelnuts.  Pour the liquid
ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix well.  In a clean bowl
with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until stiff.  Gently fold the
whites into the batter. Pour some batter into the waffle iron.  Cook
until the steaming stops and the waffles are crisp.  (Because of the
moisture in the potatoes, these waffles.) Serve with the peach sauce.
