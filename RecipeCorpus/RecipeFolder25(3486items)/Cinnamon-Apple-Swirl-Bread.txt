Categories: Bread, Breadmaker, Apples, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1 T  Dry Milk (Optional)
1 t  Cinnamon
1 c  Water or milk
2 1/4 c  Flour
1 t  Salt
2 T  Brown Sugar
2 T  Butter
You can go one of two ways here:  Either use the "Dough" setting, and
roll up the dough with the filling, then bake in a conventional
manner, or add some chopped apple at the beep.  The first way looks
better, the second way is easier. Filling: 1 Apple, peeled, cored,
and chopped into 1/4" dice 3 Tbs. Brown Sugar 1 tsp. Cinnamon 1 Tbs.
Flour 1/4 tsp. nutmeg (optional) Mix all the dry stuff together, then
toss over the chopped apple.  Roll out the dough into a rectangle,
then spread the mixture evenly over the rectangle.  Roll the dough
along the short edge, like a jelly roll. Place in a greased loaf pan,
let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes, then bake in a 350F degree
oven for about 40 minutes, until the loaf is nice and brown, and
sounds hollow when tapped. Let cool on a rack, devour.
