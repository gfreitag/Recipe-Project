Title: Cheater's Fish Stock
Categories: Soup/stew, Fish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 1/2 cups
3 c  Water
1    Dried chili pepper
2 lg Bay leaves
8    Black peppercorns
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 sm Onion; minced
1 md Carrot; peeled and minced
2    Celery ribs; minced
8    Parsley stems; chopped
1 c  Dry white wine
3    8-oz bottles clam juice
Bring all the ingredients to a boil; simmer to blend flavors (no
skimming necessary), about 30 minutes. Strain through cheesecloth,
pressing solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as
possible. Use in place of regular fish stock.

Note: clam juice is extremely salty, so don't add salt to the base
until after you've brought the doctored clam juice and base to a
simmer.
