Take coconut out of shell and process or grate it in the water, then
squeeze it through double-layered cheesecloth.  Use only the liquid;
throw gratings away. It works better if you let it sit for an hour or
so before sieving.

Cook the beans in the coconut milk for one hour (simmering).  Chop
onion and scallions and add with thyme, allspice, garlic, 1 tsp salt
and 2 lbs rice. Add water to cover + one inch over top of rice and
beans mixture. (use 1st knuckle to guess). Bring to a boil, turn down
heat and simmer, covered, 40 minutes or until rice is done.
