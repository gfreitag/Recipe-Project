Title: Kiwifruit Mint Jam
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 batch
2 c  Sugar
3    6" sprigs of fresh mint
2 lb Ripe kiwifruit
1    Lemon; zest of
Peel and quarter kiwifruit.  Slice thinly and combine with lemon zest
in a heavy, nonreactive 4-quart pan.  Bring fruit to a boil, reduce
heat to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring every 2-3 minutes.

When the mixture hisses as a spoon is drawn through it, begin adding
the sugar 1/2 cup at a time.  Continue cooking briskly and stirring
until jam mixture thickens and there is a tight pattern of bubbles
over the top. This will happen in less than 5 minutes.  The
temperature of the hot liquid will be 212 F.

Off the heat, crush the mint sprigs in the hot jam.  Let them steep
for 2 minutes.  Cool a spoonful of jam and taste.  Remove the stems
when the taste of mint is noticeable but before it is pronounced.

Fill hot, sterilized jars to within 1/8" of lips.  Wipe the rims
clean, attach new lids, and screw caps on tightly.  Invert jars
briefly for a quick vacuum seal or process in a boiling water bath,
submerged by 1 inch, for 10 minutes.

Yield: 2 2/3 cups.

The author writes: "A touch of citrus fragrance and the cool, soothing
sensation of fresh mint in this kiwifruit jam highlight the
considerable flavor range in this fuzzy little fruit.  It is sweet, a
bit acidic, particularly before it ripens, and its scent recalls ripe
bananas and strawberries."
