Title: Arroz Verde (Green Rice)
Categories: Tex/mexican, Rice, Chilies, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Onion; coarsely chopped
1/4 ts Garlic; finely chopped
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 c  Long grain rice; raw
4    Poblano chilies; or 4 green
;peppers, each 4 inches in
;diameter
4 c  Chicken stock; fresh or can
1 c  Parsley, fresh; coarsely
;chopped
Roast the chilies or peppers, remove their skins, stems, seeds and
thick white membranes and discard.  Chop the chilies into chunks.
Combine 1 cup of the chunks and 1/2 cup of stock in the jar of a
blender and blend at high speed for 15 seconds.  Then gradually add
the remaining chilies and the parsley, onions, garlic, salt and
pepper, blending until the mixture is reduced to a smooth puree.  (To
make the sauce by hand, puree the chilies, parsley, onions and
garlic, a cup or so at a time, in a food mill set over a bowl.
Discard any pulp left in the mill. Stir in 1/2 cup of stock and the
salt and pepper.)
Pour the oil into a 2 to 3 quart casserole and set it over moderate
heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the rice and stir
constantly for 2 to 3 minutes until the grains are coated with oil.
Do not let them brown. Now add the pureed chili mixture and simmer,
stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, bring the remaining
3 1/2 cups of stock to a boil in a small saucepan and pour it over
the rice. Return to a boil, cover the casserole and reduce the heat
to its lowest point. Simmer undisturbed for 18 to 20 minutes, or
until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid.  Before
serving, fluff the rice with a fork. If the rice must wait, remove
the cover and drape the pan loosely with a towel. Place in a
preheated 250 degree (F) oven to keep warm.
