Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 c  Asian pear, peeled, diced
1 ts Zest, lemon
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Juice, lime OR
1 tb Juice, lemon
1 ts Five spice, powder
1 tb Wine, plum
Sugar, confectioner's
3 ea Phyllo dough, sheets
1/4 c  Butter, melted
1/3 c  Coconut, toasted,
-- shredded
2 c  Lyche, seeded, halved
1/4 c  Walnut, roasted, chopped
1/4 c  Raisins, soaked in
-- plum wine
3 tb Ginger, candied
Filling: ========

Soak your golden raisins in plum wine overnight or longer.

Depending on the ingredients available to you, mix appropriate
quantities up so as to fill the dough.  You can certainly use more or
less of each ingredient to suit your individual tastes.  You'll need
about four cups total filling.

Assembly: =========

Spread the two sheets of phyllo dough out on your work surface,
one on top of the other.  Paint the top layer of dough with some of
the melted better and then spread a nice thin layer of toasted
coconut over the entire pastry.

Pour your filling along the long edge of the phyllo dough, and
roll the dough up as tightly as possible (remember to fold in the
ends as you roll so the ends are "sealed") and put on a non-stick
baking sheet.

Paint the top of the roll with melted butter and bake at 350 F
until the dough is golden brown.

When done, take the strudel out of the oven and let it cool on a
rack. Just before serving, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the
top. Slice the roll on a diagonal for a more attractive presentation.

For elegant presentation, you might serve the strudel pieces on a
plate with slices of kiwi, orange, lemon, and pear as garnish.
