Title: Baking Powder (Or Buttermilk) Biscuits
Categories: Bread
Yield: 18 biscuits
1/3 c  Shortening, veg., chilled
3/4 c  Milk OR Buttermilk
Milk for glaze (opt)
Sesame seeds (opt)
1/2 c  Cheese, sharp cheddar (opt)
2 c  Flour, sifted
1 t  Salt
4 t  Baking powder
-OR 2 t powder + 1/2 t soda
-for buttermilk biscuits
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Sift flour salt and baking powder (or
baking powder and baking soda for buttermilk biscuits) into a bowl.
Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender until the texture is like
coarse crumbs. (For a variation, add 1/2 c sharp cheddar cheese.)
Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Pour in the milk (or
buttermilk) and stir with a fork, just until the dough holds together.

Knead it gently on a lightly floured board for half a minute or so,
then roll it with a lightly floured roller until it is about 1/2 inch
thick. Cut it into rounds with a lightly floured biscuit cutter and
put them onto ungreased baking sheets.

Reroll and cut the scraps into more biscuits. If you like, brush the
tops with milk and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake 12 to 15 minutes
until they are lightly browned. Makes about 1 1/2 dozen 2-inch
biscuits.
