Title: Chicken Dog #1
Categories: Can/preserv, Sausage, Chicken, Poultry
Yield: 3 pounds
1/2 ts Ground mace
1/2 ts Finely ground mustard seed
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Fine grind white pepper
1 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
3    Feet small hog or sheep
-casings
3 lb Chicken meat-15% fat
1 tb Onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Finely fround coriander
1/2 ts Dried marjoram
Prepare casings. Mix the remaining ingredients together. If you
desire a sausage like texture, grind through the fine disk twice and
stuff. If you desire a texture more like commercial hot dogs, process
a third at a time in a food processor until it has a thick puree like
consistency. The result is harder to stuff, but seems more like a
"real" hot dog. Tie off into 5" lengths. Bring a large pot of water
to a boil. Add the links, without separating them, immediately reduce
the heat and simmer very gently for 30 minutes. Remove and place in
ice water. chill thoroughly. Remove, pat dry, and refrigerate up to a
week or freeze.
