Title: Old Fashioned Homemade Rock Candy
Categories: Candy, Homemade
Yield: 2 servings
No Ingredients Found
Fill a jar with HOT water, and begin disolving sugar in it. Keep
adding sugar until NO more will disolve, a super saturated solution.
Take the cover of the jar, punch a small hole in it. Suspend a string
thru the hole by tying a knot in the top. Put it away in a dark place
and let it cool or put it in the "ice-box." Go back and check it a
few days later and you have crystals on the string. Heat the water,
add more sugar, until saturated

and repeat putting the crystals back in the water. Keep doing this
until they are as big as you want them to get. Now this is really
nostalgia, from the '30s  [grin] Shared by: Bob Johnstone
