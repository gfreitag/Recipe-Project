Title: Japanese Frosting
Categories: Cake/cookie, Japanese
Yield: 1 servings
Flavoring
Food coloring
1/2 c  Butter
2 c  Icing sugar
2 ea Egg whites
Cream butter.  Gradually stir in 1/2 cup icing sugar, beating until
smooth. Set aside.  Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry.
Gradually beat in 1 cup of the icing sugar.  Combine both mixtures
and continue adding the icing sugar until you get a good spreading
consistency.  Add desired flavor and colorings.  Should be stiff
enough to hold it's own shape. Makes enough for a large layer cake.
(This is the best icing I have had....next to cream cheese icing....
