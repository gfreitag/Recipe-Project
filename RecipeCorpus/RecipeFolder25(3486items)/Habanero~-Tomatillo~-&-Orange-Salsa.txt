Title: Habanero~ Tomatillo~ & Orange Salsa
Categories: Dip, Fruit, Salsa/sauce, Chilies
Yield: 1 batch
-- with 3-4" of green
Salt
Lime juice
1 lb Tomatillos
3    Or 4 habaneros
2    Oranges
1 bn Green onions; sliced fine
In an ungreased skillet over medium heat, roast half of the
tomatillos in their husks for about 10 minutes, turning frequently.
Meanwhile, husk the remaining tomatillos, dice fine, and place them
in a bowl. Cool the roasted tomatillos, then husk and place them in a
blender.

Roast the habaneros over low heat, turning occasionally, for about 5
minutes, or until they are just soft and speckled with brown.  Wearing
rubber gloves, stem and seed them and add them to the tomatillos in
the blender. Puree the mixture.

Squeeze one of the oranges and pour the juice into the bowl
containing the diced tomatillos. Add the pureed peppers and
tomatillos. Peel the other orange, removing the pith, then seed if
necessary and cut into small dice. Add the diced orange and green
onions to the salsa.

Season the salsa with salt and lime juice, and let stand for about
half an hour before serving.

Yield: About 2 cups.

The authors write:  "This is one of our favorite salsas and one that
wins raves from habanero lovers in our cooking classes.  It is simple
and quick to make, and the recipe is easily doubled.  It is tropical
rather than Southwestern in flavor, but it can be used in any menu in
which you want a hot salsa.  It's great with white corn chips."

Recipe from Carolyn Dille and Susan Belsinger in their "Chile
Peppers: A Fiery Fiesta of Flavor" article in "The Herb Companion."
