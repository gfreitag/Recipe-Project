Categories: Vegetable, Beef, Main dish, Rice
Yield: 3 servings
No salt (it's in the soup)
1 c  Cooked Basmati Rice
Sauce
2 cn (28oz) Crushed tomatoes
1/2 t  Oregano
1/2 t  Basil
ds Parsley
1 tb Brown sugar

ds Dillweed
1 md Head Cabbage
MEAT FILLING
1/2 cn Tomato soup (undiluted)
1/4 c  Milk
1 lb Ground beef (a mixture of
Ground pork and poultry
Can be used also)
1/2 t  Oregano
1/2 t  Basil
1/2 t  Italian Seasoning
ds Dillweed
Pepper
1 md Egg
Put all sauce ingrediants in non-stick pot, simmer. Put rice
:
on to cook (i use 1/2 cup to 1 1/2 cups water & dash salt). Put large
pot filled with water on to boil, core cabbage and add whole cabbage
to water.. When rice is cooked sauce should be ready but you can keep
simmering till your ready to use. (stir to keep from burning). With
tongs peel each cabbage leaf off carefully while it is still in pot
(be careful of the steam) when they are limp enough to remove. Be
sure not to tear the leaf. You'll need at least 12 leaves.

Mix all filling ingrediants well, making sure all beef chunks
:
are broken up.
Fill leaves with about a 1/4 cup of fillings. Roll sides in
:
then back, then front, turn over in (9x13 glass) pan so that seams
are on underside. Pour half sauce over rolls and bake at 350 for 2
hours, covered with foil (shiny side in). Halfway through cooking you
may find a lot of water in pan.. drain this off carefully (sometimes
it's fat.. and who needs that..) and return to oven.
Serve with extra sauce poured over rolls. Makes 12-13 rolls
