Title: Steamed Lavender Chicken or Rabbit
Categories: Game, Main dish, Poultry, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
Salt and pepper
Few sprigs flowering
-lavender
4    Chicken or rabbit portions
Put a few sprigs of flowering lavender in the bottom of a steamer and
place the chicken or rabbit portions in the top.  Steam for 20 to 30
minutes, until the meat is just tender; it should still be nice and
juicy. Keep warm.

Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook, stirring,
for 2 minutes.  Pour in enough of the lavender-flavored water from
the steamer to give a sauce of the consistency you like, bring to the
boil and simmer for 5 minutes.  Season to taste.

Slice the meat and serve, covered in pale lavender sauce.  Decorate
each portion with a sprig of flowering lavender.

Leggatt writes: "Crunchy broccoli and wild rice go well with this
aromatic dish."
