Pozole is a simple, rustic stew common throughout the pueblos in New
Mexico and parts of Arizona.  Made from dried hominy, salt pork,
spices, and dried red chiles, the stew is usually cooked in large
quantities. It is customarily eaten during pueblo feast days, when
the pueblo's patron saint is celebrated, and on New Year's Day, when
a hearty meal for cold weather is welcome.

The stew is traditionally served with a variety of condiments.  It
tastes especially good with Red Chile Sauce, freshly roasted diced
green chiles, chile pequin and any of the Indian breads.
