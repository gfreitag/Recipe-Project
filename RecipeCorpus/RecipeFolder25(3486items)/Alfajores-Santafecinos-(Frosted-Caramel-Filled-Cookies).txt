Yield: 20 cookies

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  Pour the flour and salt into a
large mixing bowl, make a well in the center, and drop in the egg
yolks and melted butter.  With your fingers gradually mix the
ingredients together, continuing to mix until the dough can be
gathered into a compact ball. Remove the dough to a lightly floured
surface and knead it vigorously for 10 minutes, or until it is smooth
and elastic.
Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then roll it into a large circle
about 1/16 inch thick.  With a 2 inch cookie cutter or the rim of a
glass, cut out as many rounds as you can from the dough.  Gather the
scraps together into another ball, roll out again, and cut into
similar rounds, repeating until all the dough has been used.  Place
the rounds 1 inch apart on one or two lightly buttered cookie sheets
and bake in the middle of the oven for 10 minutes, or until the
cookies are lightly browned. With a spatula transfer them to a cake
rack to cool.
Pour the sugar into a small bowl and gradually mix in the heavy
cream. The icing should coat the spoon lightly.  If it seems thin,
add a few spoonfuls of sugar; if it is thick, add a little more
cream. With a pastry brush, coat the tops of half the cookies with a
thin layer of icing and let them dry for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile,
spread the remaining cookies with a 1/4 inch layer of natillas
piuranas. Pair the cookies like sandwiches, with the icing on top and
the natillas piuranas in the center.
