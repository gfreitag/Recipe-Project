2 t  Chopped, fresh
Tarragon or dill if using
Salmon (or 1 t . dried herb
1 t  Salt
1/8 t  White pepper
3 T  Lemon juice
3 dr Hot pepper sauce
Cut fish into 2-inch pieces; puree in food processor, using steel
blade. Add tarragon, salt, pepper, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, hot
pepper sauce, and egg to the pureed fish.  With motor running, pour
cream through feed tube and process until smooth and thick, about 25
seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl, and process again about 10
seconds. By hand, stir in wild rice until well blended. Chill 1 hour.
Tie one end of sausage casing with cotton string.  Spoon fish mixture
into pastry bag with 1/2-inch plain tip, and moisten tip with water.
Ease open end of casing completely over pastry tip, and slide rest of
casing length over tube, leaving a 4-inch end free. With steady,
moderate pressure, squeeze fish mixture into sausage casing, pulling
it off pastry tip as it fills. Tie the free end and then twist and
tie filled casing at 4-inch intervals.  You will have about 8
sausages.
In deep skillet, large enough to hold sausages in one layer, bring
enough Court Bouillon to cover suasages to a simmer.  Prick sausages
in several places with a needle or pin; simmer 15 minutes in Court
Bouillon. Remove sausages with slotted spoon and drain.
To serve immediately, heat butter in frying pan and add sausages;
brown quickly for 1 to 2 minutes. (dont over cook or they will bedry
and grainy.) Sprinkel with remaining lemon juice while browning.
Serve with Herbed Hollandise Sauce, if desired.
