Core apples from blossom ends, leaving stem ends intact.  Mix raisins
and walnuts and stuff into cavities of cored apples.  Set apples,
stems up in a 7x12-inch pan. In a 1 to 2 quart pan, mix brown sugar,
water, butter,cinnamon, and nutmeg; stir over high heat until mixture
boils. Pour hot syrup around apples. Bake, uncovered, in 350~ oven,
basting occasionally with syrup, until apples are tender when pierced
and skin begins to crack, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove apples from oven;
cool in pan at least 10 minutes or let cool to room temperature. Set
each apple in a small bowl and spoon syrup around fruit. In the top
of each apple, cut a hole large enough for one of the candy worms and
tuck one end into each apple, leaving most of the worm dangling.
Offer cream to pour over apples. Makes 6 ghastly servings.
