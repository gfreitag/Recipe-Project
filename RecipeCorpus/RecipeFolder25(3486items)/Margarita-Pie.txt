Soften gelatin 5 minutes in mixture of lemon rind and lemon juice.

cup sugar and salt.  Add gelatin mixture and cook over boiling water,
stirring constantly, about 7 minutes or until slightly thickened and
gelatin is dissolved.

Immediately transfer hot mixture to bowl; thoroughly blend in tequila
and Triple Sec.  Chill over ice water or in refrigerator, stirring
frequently until just cold to the touch.  (Mixture should not be too
thick.)

Beat egg whites to soft peak stape; gradually beat in 7 tablespoons
sugar. Whites should be glossy and moist.  Fold yolk mixture, about
1/3 at a time, into whites.

Spoon mixture into chilled Pretzel Crumb Crust; sprinkle with reserved
crumbs.  Chill until firm.  Pie is best when served the same day it is
made.

Pretzel Crumb Crust: Combine crumbs and sugar; add melted butter
gradually, stirring to mix well. Reserve 2 tablespoons crumb mixture
for garnish. Press remaining mixture onto bottom and sides of a
well-buttered 9-inch pieplate; chill.
