This is Chicken Paprika as fixed in our home - quickly. My
grandmother used to do it very muchly from scratch, using a stewing
hen (meaning, a chicken past its egg-laying prime) and it took
several hours to get tender... As in all my cooking, measurements are
approximate. 2 cooked, boned chicken breasts, cut in bite-size pieces
2 teaspoons paprika 1 small to medium onion, finely chopped 2
tablespoons butter or margarine 1 tablespoon flour 1 tablespoon sour
cream powdered chicken-flavored bouillon salt pepper

Roast onion in butter until starting to turn light brown. Add paprika,
stir.  Add flour, stir. Add 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, stirring
constantly.  Add enough chicken-flavored bouillon powder to obtain
fairly strong flavor.  Microwave chicken until hot, add to sauce.
Remove from heat while fixing dumplings. After dumplings are ready,
reheat to just below boiling. Remove from heat. Stir in one
tablespoon sour cream. Pour over dumplings. FLOUR DUMPLINGS 2 to 2
1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 egg 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons oil
milk Mix flour, egg, oil, salt with enough milk to make a fairly
thick dough. Drop teaspoon-to-tablespoon-size chunks of dough into
boiling salted water. Keep boiling until dumplings float to top.
Drain, and briefly rinse dumplings with cold water. If desired,
briefly swish them around in melted butter. Serves: 2 (Continued to

I spend many a lunch time with fish sandwiches.  Why do I always get
the brand new bottle of Heinz ketchup. Do they throw them away after
someone gets them started?  Do they save the new ones just for me.  I
tap, then I whack them harder.  All the time reminded of that great
poem, Ketchup bottle, Ketchup bottle First none'll come and then a
