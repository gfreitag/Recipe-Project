20 oz Broth, Chicken
1/2 c  Wine, Dry
1/2 c  Cheese, Parmesan; grated
2 tb Butter or Olive, Oil
2 tb Onion; finely chopped
1 c  Rice, white (raw)

=========================> Directions <==========================

Place two tablespoons hot olive oil in large heavy saucepan; saute
onion until golden about 2 minutes. Stir chicken broth and rice into
the onion mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook over
medium heat 10 minutes or until broth is almost all absorbed. Stir in
wine. Layer rice in casserole with sauce and sprinkle parmesan cheese
until all rice is used up ending with tomato sauce and cheese. Bake
in 300 degree oven for 1/2 hour.

=====================> Notes and Credits <=======================

This was a change from spaghetti which grandma Parodi would have on
alternate Sundays, and I can still see the large platter of this rice
on her table, the aroma getting to us all and making us go back for
seconds.

Dorothy's note: A collection of recipes tested in the kitchen of Jo
Parodi in a cookbook created with love for her family and friends. A
colleague has allowed me to borrow his mother's present to him, and
lucky for us, Mrs. Parodi has given her permission for me to post
some of the family recipes from her 1973 cookbook. From: DOROTHY HAIR
