Salad: Using wire whip, blend cold water with gelatin.  Add boiling
water and mix well.  Whip in sugar and vanilla and mix well. Whip in
sour cream and cool whip.  Pour into ring mold and refrigerate
overnight.

Several hours before you're ready to serve, make the topping.

Mom's topping: Stir junket into cold liquid in pan--we use part of the
raspberry juice to replace part of the water.  Bring to boil, boil 1
minute.  Cool completely, but do not refrigerate. Just before
serving, add raspberries, pour over unmolded salad, and serve extra
sauce on the side.

My Last-Minute Panicked Topping: stir sugar and tapioca into water and
bring to boil.  Boil 1 minute.  Cool completely but do not
refrigerate. Follow serving directions as above.
