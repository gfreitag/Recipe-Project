1. Cut each checken breast into two fillets. Lightly coat each with
flour seasoned with salt and pepper. 2. Pour oil into large frying
pan over medium heat. When hot, add fillets and cook until golden
brown on both sides. Remove from pan, discard oil. 3. Melt butter in
same pan and when hot add mushrooms. When lightly browned stir in
cream and parsley. (whipping cream must be used, not lighter cream as
this may separate when boiled). When hot, return fillets to mixture
