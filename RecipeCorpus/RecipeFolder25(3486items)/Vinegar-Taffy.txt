From Grandma Ruby's recipe file: newspaper clipping

Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of
the mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a
candy thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle
flavoring over top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward
the center until cool and firm enough to handle.

Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and
fingers are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to
pull taffy. When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with
both hands. Fold over and pull out again.

As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will
become stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand.  Pull until
it is difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.

Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors
and roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store
cooled taffy in an air tight container in a cool dry place.

If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2
Tablespoons corn syrup and 1/4 cup water.  Stir until dissolved and
then recook according to original directions.

Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added
as the taffy is being pulled.

I wish I had a date for this...I'd say recipe is at _least_ 30 years
old...possibly 40, maybe even more...  This is a lesson to all of you
to date your recipes, including newspaper clippings!
