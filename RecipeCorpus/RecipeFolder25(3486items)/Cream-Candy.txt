Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 batch
1 c  Boiling Water
2 ts Vanilla
1    Stick Margarine, Melted
3 c  Sugar
3 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Cream of Tartar
1 tb Apple Cider Vinegar

cover. Cook until steaming.  Continue to cook on high for 45 seconds,
remove the lid and lower heat to low.  Cook until the temperature is
240 degrees, add melted butter and cook until the temperature is 260
degrees. Pour candy on lightly buttered Marble slab, allow to cool
until you can handle it. Pull candy for 5 minutes, add Vanilla to
outside of the candy and continue to pull for 13 more minutes. Try to
end up with a rope about 5 feet long and cut it into pieces with
kitchen shears. Place the cut pieces on end and do not allow the
pieces to touch.

Lightly butter your hands before pulling the candy, after you add the
Vanilla the candy will be sticky, wash your hands in cold water when
this happens.
