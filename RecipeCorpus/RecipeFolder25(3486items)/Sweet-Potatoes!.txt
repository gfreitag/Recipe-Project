This is more of an information file than a recipe.  But, there are
several ideas for recipes in it.

Sweet potatoes and holiday dinners seem to go together.  This
versatile vegetable is a fiber-rich food, high in vitamins A and C.

Sweet potatoes are easy to cook.  Try baking them (450Ã¸ for 40 to 60
minutes).  Rub a little margarine on the skin before baking to make it
softer.  Or, you can boil them, whole and unpeeled, for 20 to 30
minutes.

For mashed sweet potatoes, peel boiled sweet potatoes and mash with
an electric mixer.  Add one Cup of warm milk and 1/4 Cup margarine
for every four cups of mashed potato.  For a different flavor, use
orange juice instead of milk and add a dash of nutmeg.

You can also shred raw sweet potatoes and add to salads; cube them
and add to stew; pan fry them cut into slices with sausage and apple;
pare, slice and serve raw with a dip; or french fry them like regular
potatoes.
