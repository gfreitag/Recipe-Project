In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
Cut in the lard until the mixture resembles cornmeal.  Add 1/2 cup of
water and stir until the dough can be gathered into a ball.  If
needed, add more water, 1 tbsp at a time.  Let the dough rest for 15
minutes. Divide the dough into 12 portions and shape into balls.
Turn onto a lightly floured board and roll each ball into a 7 inch
round.  Trim uneven edges to make round tortillas.  STack the rounds
and cut the stack into 6 wedges. In a deep skillet heat 1/2 inch of
oil.  Fry the wedges a few at a time for about 45 seconds, or until
they are crisp and lightly browned. Drain well on paper toweling.
Sprinkle the chips lightly with salt. In a blender container, combine
the remaining ingredients. Cover and blend until well combined.
