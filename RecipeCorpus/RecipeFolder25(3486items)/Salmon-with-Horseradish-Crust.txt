I use prepared horseradish, but fresh grated can be substituted. Heat
the oven to 425 degrees.  Drain the horseradish and combine it with
the mayonnaise.  Season the breadcrumbs with 1/2 tsp Salt and 1/4 tsp
pepper. Pat the Salmon Steaks dry with paper towel and put them on a
rack in a shallow pan.  Coat the top of the steaks with the
mayonnaise mixture and sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top.  Bake until
almost done, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and heat the broiler.
Broil the Salmon Steaks until the crust is brown, about 2-3 minutes.
