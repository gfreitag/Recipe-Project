Title: Old Fashioned Pumpkin Butter
Categories: Can/preserv, Homemade, Pumpkin
Yield: 18 servings
1 1/4 t  Ground cinnamon
1/2 t  Ground ginger
** Or process in blender or
-processor **
8 c  Pumpkin, cooked And mashed
-**
8 c  Brown sugar
Rind from 4 lemons, grated
Juice from 4 lemons
Combine all of the ingredients in a large pot or kettle.  Cook over
low heat for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently.  When the
mixture is very thick but still easily spreadable, spoon into hot
sterilize pint jars, leaving 1/4 inch headroom.  Top with sterilized
lid and tighten the screw bands down.  Place in a large canning
kettle of boiling water, making sure that there is 2-inches of water
above the tops of the jars.  Bring the water back to a full rolling
boil and boil for 5 minutes, adding 1 minute for every 1,000 feet
above sea level.  Remove from the water and cool. Check the seals on
the lids and store when fully cooled. NOTE: The water bath is safe
for this recipe for only one reason.  It contains acid in the form of
Lemon Juice.  If you were canning the pumpkin as a vegetable or in
the puree form, you would have to use a pressure cooker or add the
lemon juice in the same ratio as above.  If you want to freeze the
puree, the lemon juice is not needed. YIELD:  6 Pints
