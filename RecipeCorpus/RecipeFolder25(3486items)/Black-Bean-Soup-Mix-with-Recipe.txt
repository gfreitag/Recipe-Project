*It isn't made clear in the book, but I believe that it means the
pound of beans IN the mix, not an additional pound.

Mix: Place beans in an airtight container. Combine remaining
ingredients, store in an airtight container.

Soup: Soak beans overnight. Drain. Saute onion and polish sausage in
oil until onion is clear. Add beans and soup mix. Stir, then add
water. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, 2hours. Season with
salt and pepper. 8 servings
