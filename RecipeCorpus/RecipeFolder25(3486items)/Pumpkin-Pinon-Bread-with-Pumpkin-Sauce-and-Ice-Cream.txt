MMMMM--------------------PUMPKIN-PINON BREAD-------------------------
3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Sunflower oil
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Cooked pumpkin
1 1/2 c  Roasted pinons
2 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Ground cinnamon
3    Eggs, beaten
To make the pumpkin sauce and ice cream, beat the egg yolks and sugar
together in a large bowl.  Set aside.

Heat the milk and vanilla bean in a saucepan over high heat.  Stir
constantly until it almost reaches boiling poingt.  Remove from the
heat and slowly whisk the hot milk into the egg and sugar mixture.
Return the misture to the saucepan over medium-low heat and stir
constantly about 10 minutes to thicken mixture.  Do not allow mixture
to boil or it will curdle.

Once the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, remove
it from the heat and add the pureed pumpkin.  Stir until completely
mixed.

Put 2 cups of the mixture in a bowl and add to it the ground cloves,
nutmeg, and cinnamon.  Mix together well and set over ice, stirring
occasionally, until cool, then refrigerate.  This pumpkin sauce will
last up to 5 days refrigerated in a covered container.

Pour the remainder of the egg-pumpkin mixture into another bowl.  Set
over ice, stirring occasionally, until it has cooled completely, then
place in an ice cream machine and freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.  The ice cream will last several weeks
in a covered container in the freezer.

To make the pumpkin bread, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Sift
together the flour, baking soda, salt, sugar and cinnamon.

In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla an dmix
well.
Stir in the pumpkin puree and the dry ingredients, mix well, and
fold in the pinons.

Pour the batter into  2 greased 5-X-9 inch loaf pans and bake 45
minutes, until the bread springs back when touched.

Serve with the pumpkin sauce and Ice Cream as dessert.

*** NOTE *** To roast pinons, also known as pine nuts, place them in a
frying pan over medium heat and stir constantly so that they brown
evenly, 3 to 5 minutes.
No butter or oil is needed because the nuts contain natural oils.
************************

This is a moist, dense bread that can be eaten alone like a tea
bread, for a snack, or for breakfast.  With the addition of the
Pumpkin Sauce and Ice Cream, the bread can also be enjoyed as a
wonderfully rich dessert.
