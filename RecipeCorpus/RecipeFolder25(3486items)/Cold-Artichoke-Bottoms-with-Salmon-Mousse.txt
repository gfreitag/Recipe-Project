Cut the stems off the artichokes as close to the base as possible.
Remove the first few layers of outer leaves.  When the leaves become
light green and bend forward, cut them off with a sharp knife close
to the base. Rub the cut parts immediately with the cut side of 1/2
lemon. In a large enamel saucepan, combine the flour, 1 T lemon juice
& water. Bring the mixture to a boil, add a pinch of salt and the
artichoke bottoms. Cook them for 20 to 30 minutes or until tender. Do
not overcook them. Cool and dry well on paper towels.  As soon as
they are cool enough to handle, remove the choke with a spoon and
trim the artichoke bottoms with a sharp knife. Pour vinaigrette over
the bottoms. Cover the bowl and let marinate 2 hours. Puree the
salmon in a blender, add mayonnaise, salt, white pepper, a touch of
cayenne, lemon juice and dill. Chill the mixture for 1 hour. If it
seems too thick, thin it out with a little sour or whipped cream. The
mixture must be quite thick to stay on the artichoke bottoms. Drain
the artichoke bottoms and dry well on paper towels. Top each one with
a dome of salmon mousse.  Sprinkle lightly with paprika.  Make a
little circle of capers on each dome and top each one with 2 tiny
sprigs of dill and a black olive. Chill again and serve cold with
buttered pumpernickel. From "Seasonal Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.
