Title: Debbie's Split Pea Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Main dish, Pork, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 t  Pepper
1 ea Ham bone (leftover)
2 c  Ham, cooked & diced
1 lb Dried split peas
8 c  Water (2 quarts)
1 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Chopped onion
Rinse peas, add to a 4 or 5-quart saucepan.  Add water and bring to a
boil. Boil gently for 2 minutes.  Turn off heat; cover and let stand
for 1 hour. After the hour is up, DO NOT DRAIN!  Add the remaining
ingredients, except the diced ham, to the pot.  Heat to boiling.
Reduce heat and simmer on low heat for about 3 hours or until peas
are very soft and soup is of a creamy consistency. Remove bone and
check for any stray bones or grissle in the pot.  You can trim the
meat from the bone and add to the soup (if it hasn't already fallen
off the bone!)  Add diced ham. Continue to heat until the diced ham
is heated through and the soup is of the consistency you desire; add
more water if too thick. Check seasonings and serve with toasted
sourdough bread (yummy!) Note: We eat this soup as a main meal. It is
very filling and wonderful on a cold night! Serves: 3 to 4 Adapted
