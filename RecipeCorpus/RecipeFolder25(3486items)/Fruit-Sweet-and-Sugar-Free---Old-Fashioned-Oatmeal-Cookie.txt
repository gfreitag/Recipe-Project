Categories: Dessert, Diabetic, Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 dozen
1 t  Cinnamon
1 t  Baking soda
pn Salt
1 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
3/4 c  Walnuts
3/4 c  Raisins
1 c  Butter
3/4 c  Fruit sweetener
2    Eggs
1 t  Vanilla extract
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the walnuts in the preheated
oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring occsionally. Allow the nuts to cool.
Then process in a food processor, using the pulsing action, until
they are coarsely choped. Bring 1 cup water to a boil, and add the
raisins. When the water returns to a boil, turn the heat off, and let
the raisins plump in the water for at least 10 minutes. Drain the
raisins, saving any raisin water for another use. Cream the butter
and sweetener together. When light and fluffy, add the eggs one at a
time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla,
cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. When mixed, add the flour, oates,
chopped nuts, and plumped raisins. Cover the dough and refrigerate it
for 30 minutes to make it easier to handle. Preheat the oven to 325
degrees, line baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a #12 scoop
(or a 1/2 cup measure) for giant cookies or a #24 scoop (2
tablespoons) or a spoon for regular size cookies, scoop out the dough
and place the balls 1 inch apart on insulated cookie sheets. With
lightly moistened finers, flatten the cookies to a thickness of 1/3
inch. Bake until a light golden brown. Giant cookies bake for 20-24
minutes, and regular sized cookies bake for 12-15 minutes. Remove the
cookies to a wire rack to cool. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   10-19-94
