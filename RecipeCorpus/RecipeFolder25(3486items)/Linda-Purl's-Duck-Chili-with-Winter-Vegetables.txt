"The first thing I ever cooked," recalls Linda Purl, star of the
syndicated series ROBIN'S HOODS, "Was some butter cookies for Santa
in a little kiddie oven. He always ate them - at least, they were
gone in the morning."

Now, with a little kiddie of her own on the way, Purl no longer cooks
for Santa - but she does cook Christmas dinner for her husband,
screenwriter Alexander Cary. Her Duck Chili is anything by
traditional. "I was raised in Japan, but now and them the Yankee in
me comes out, which is where the chili fits in. And I like to cook
with the seasons. This utilizes all of the wonderful, hearty
vegetables available in the winter."

Preheat oven to 350'F. Coat a small roasting pan with vegetable oil.
Place duckling in pan and cook for 3 hours. Allow duck to cool.
Separate meat from bones and dice. Place in large pot with olive oil,
onions, turnip, and carrots and saute for 15 minutes. Add remaining
ingredients and let simmer for 15 minutes. Serve over rice.
