Title: Gabriella's Apple Crisp
Categories: Dessert, Apples
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1/2 t  Cinnamon
1/4 t  Salt
3/4 c  Flour
1/4 c  Butter
2 lb Tart green apples (about
-5 to 5 1/2 cups sliced)
1/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Brown sugar
Peel the apples and slice them thinly.  Put them in a rather shallow
1-quart casserole and spinkle them with the water.  Put them aside
while you prepare the crust.  Sift together the dry ingredients and
cut in the butter until all is well combined.  Sprinkle this mixture
thickly and evenly over the apples.  Don't mix the two together.
Cover the casserole and bake at 350degF for 1/2 hour, then uncover
and bake another 1/2 hour. The crust will be crisp on top and will
have partly seeped down through the apples, flavoring them and
binding them slightly together. Serve hot or cold.
