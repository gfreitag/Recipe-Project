Categories: Dessert, Ice cream, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Fresh Bing cherries, halved
1 ea Up milk
1/4 c  Shaved plain chocolate
2 ea Ar e eggs
Place the shaved chocolate flakes and the cherries in separate bowls.
Cover and refrigerate. Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light
and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time,
then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more.
Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend. Transfer the mixture
to an ice cream maker and freeze following the manufacturer's
instructions. After the ice cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before it
is done), add the chocolate and the cherries, then continue freezing

nothing except cooling them before acing in the ice cream mixture.
It does recommend shaving the chocolate th a cheese grater, after you
have frozen it.)
