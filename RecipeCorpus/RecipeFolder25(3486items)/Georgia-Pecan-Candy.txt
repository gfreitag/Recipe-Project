Title: Georgia Pecan Candy
Categories: Candy, Holiday, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 batch
3 tb Butter
1 ts Pure vanilla or
1 ts Cognac vanilla
2 c  Large pecan halves
1 c  Light brown sugar
1/2 c  White sugar
1/2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb White corn syrup
1/8 ts Salt
Put sugars, cream, corn syrup, salt and 2 tb. of the butter in a
bowl. Mix until sugars are saturated with cream.  Put in a heavy pan
over medium heat.  Stir occasionally and wipe down crystals from the
sides of the pan with a small, damp piece of cloth wrapped around the
handle of a wooden spoon, or put a lid on the pan and allow the steam
to evaporate the crystals.

Cook syrup until it registers 236 F. on a candy thermometer or a
teaspoon of the syrup dropped in cold water forms a soft ball. Remove
from heat and add remaining butter and vanilla.  When the candy has
cooled to 110 F., beat it until it begins to lose its transparency.

Add nuts.  Drop by tablespoonfuls on a buttered marble or pastry
sheet in the form of clusters.  Let cool and store in a tight tin.

Yield: About 24 candies, depending on size.

Variation:  This can be poured and made into fudge squares.  In this
case, use only 1 cup pecans or less.

Glenn writes: "This candy recipe came to me from a friend in Georgia
whose 'sweet tooth' drove her to become one of the best candy makers
in the South.  Her marble slab was covered with goodies most of the
time."
