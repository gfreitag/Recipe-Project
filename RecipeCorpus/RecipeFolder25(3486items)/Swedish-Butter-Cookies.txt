Title: Swedish Butter Cookies
Categories: Dessert, Cake/cookie, European
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
4 oz Semisweet chocolate (4
-squares)
2 T  Shortening
1/2 c  Butter
1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 t  Finely shredded lemon peel
1/4 t  Vanilla
Beat the butter with an electric mixer for 30 seconds.  Add the sugar,
lemon peel and vanilla; beat until combined.  Beat in as much of the
flour as you can with the mixer, scraping down the sides of the bowl
occasionally.  Stir in the remaining flour.  Cover and chill for 1
hour or until the dough is easy to handle.  Roll out the dough on a
lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 to 1/4 inch.  Use a
2-inch cookie cutter to cut out the dough.  Place the cutouts 1 inch
apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake in a 375F oven for 5 to 7
minutes, until the edges begin to brown.  Cool for 1 minute on the
cookie sheet then remove the cookies to a wire rack to cool.

Heat the chocolate and shortening in a saucepan over low heat,
stirring occasionally.  Dip part of each cookie into the chocolate
mixture. Cool on waxed paper for 30 minutes or until the chocolate
sets. (If necessary, chill the cookies until the chocolate sets.)

Makes about 40 cookies.
