Clean the goose and remove any remaining feather shafts. Season,
inside and outside, with the seasoning mix.  Put the bird,
breast-side down, into a very large roaster, along with any loose fat
as well as the stomach, heart, and chopped up wings. Put the apple
inside the goose. Add water to a depth of 1/5 of an inch. Roast at
475 degrees F to start out with, and then at 390 degrees F,
frequently turning and basting with pan juices, until brown and
crispy. Skim the fat off the pan juices, and thicken the gravy.
Remove the goose from the roaster, and adjust seasoning with more of
the above seasoning mix. Put on a broiler pan, and briefly broil at
570 degrees F so the skin gets extra crisp. Serve with potato
dumplings and 'Blaukraut' (red cabbage). Serves 4. From:
