Cooked brown or white rice
This curried broccoli slaw isn't a curry, but a fresh vegetable dish
flavored with curry powder. It's great served over cooked brown rice
as a vegetarian entree or side dish. Served cold, it makes a terrific
salad. Broccoli cole slaw is available in plastic bags in the produce
section; it contains shredded broccoli, red cabbage and carrots.

In a 10 to 12 inch skillet, stir the curry powder over medium heat
until it smells toasted, about 2 minutes. Add broccoli slaw, orange
peel, orange juice and maple syrup. Boil over high heat for about 8
minutes, or until vegetables are cooked tender-crisp, stirring
frequently. Stir cornstarch mixture and add to vegetables. Stir until
boiling. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve hot over cooked rice. Garnish with chopped parsley or
cilantro, if desired.

IN ADVANCE: Can be prepared in advance, refrigerated and served cold
as a salad.

Per Serving: None Given
