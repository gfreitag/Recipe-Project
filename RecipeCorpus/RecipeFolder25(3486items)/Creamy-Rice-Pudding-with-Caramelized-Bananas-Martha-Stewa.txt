Title: Creamy Rice Pudding with Caramelized Bananas-Martha Stewa
Categories: Fruit, Dessert, Pudding, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
1    Whole nutmeg
1/2 c  Long-grain white rice
2    Egg yolks
3 T  Butter
3    Ripe but firm medium bananas
1 t  Lemon juice
3 c  Milk
1 c  Heavy cream
1    Vanilla bean, split
6 T  Sugar, plus 3/4 C
Pinch of salt
1    Cinnamon stick
1. In a medium saucepan, combine 1 C of milk, the cream, vanilla
bean, 6 T sugar, salt, cinnamon, and a few gratings of nutmeg. Bring
to a boil, then remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 30
minutes.

2. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, add rice, and blanch
for 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and set aside. Remove vanilla bean and
cinnamon stick from milk mixture. Scrape seeds from bean and stir
them into the mixture; discard bean and cinnamon. Stir in blanched
rice and cook, covered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until
liquid is mostly absorbed, about 1 hour.

3. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolks and remaining milk. Add
to rice mixture, stirring well. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Do not allow to boil.
Add 1 tablespoon butter and stir until melted. Remove pudding from
heat, transfer to a bowl, and let cool slightly. Chill in
refrigerator 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until cold. Pudding will keep,
refrigerated, for up to 3 days.

4. When ready to serve, cut bananas into 1/2 inch-thick diagonal
slices. Melt remaining 2 T butter over medium heat in a heavy
skillet. Stir in remaining 3/4 C sugar and lemon juice and cook,
carefully swirling pan until a golden carmel forms. Add bananas and
cook, stirring occasionally, just until they soften and are coated
with caramel, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer pudding to individual dishes,
top with hot bananas, and serve immediately.
