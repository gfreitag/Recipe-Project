Title: Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Chocolate, Nuts/grains
Yield: 100 cookies
2 1/4 c  Flour; sifted with
1 ts Salt
1 c  Chopped nuts
12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate morsels
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Butter; creamed
3/4 c  Brown sugar
3/4 c  White sugar
2    Eggs, beaten
1 ts Soda; dissolved in
1 ts Hot water
Cream butter.  Add sugars and eggs.  Dissolve baking soda in hot
water. Add alternately with sifted flour. Add chopped nuts, chocolate
morsels, and vanilla.

Drop by half-teaspoonfuls onto greased cooky sheet.  Bake in moderate
oven, 375 deg F, for 10 to 12 minutes.  Makes 100 cookies.

At Toll House, we chill the dough overnight. When mixture is ready for
baking, we roll a teaspoon of dough between palms of hands and place
balls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets.  Then we press balls
with finger tips to form flat rounds.  This way cookies do not spread
as much in baking and they keep uniformly round.  They should be
brown through, and crispy, not white and hard as I have sometimes
seen them.
