Squid isn't tough when
-correctly prepared.  Here
-are a few basic
Rules to keep in mind
"When heated, squid protein becomes firm rapidly and then turns chewy
until long cooking breaks down the muscle.  Much of the squid's
reputation as a tough food comes from lack of knowledge of this
simple fact. Sautes should be cooked no longer than three minutes and
stews no less than twenty minutes.  Squid cooked for less than twenty
minutes or more than about three minutes probably will be tough.  If
you don't believe me, just try it. Squid absorbs water quickly from
marinades and sauces. Thus it can be prepared rapidly and still
acquire all the flavoring of its accompaniments. Marinades do help
the flavor of squid, but only up to a point. Squid should never be
marinated too long.  Half an hour is probably the optimum time. After
that, the meat starts to soften and may even take on a bitter taste
if lemon or vinegar is used. Squid, like any seafood, is fragile. It
should be refrigerated until just before use to keep it as fresh as
possible. The dark ink of the squid is its means of defense.  It
shoots it at intruders who venture too close, creating an obscuring
cloud behind which the squid makes a quick getaway.  The ink itself
is a salty, black liquid which makes an excellent flavoring for
sauces.  It is, not surprisingly, water soluble. Don't worry if you
get ink on your hands or clothes.  It washes right out." From "The
