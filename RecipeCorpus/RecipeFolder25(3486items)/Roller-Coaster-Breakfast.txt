Title: Roller Coaster Breakfast
Categories: Bread, Breakfast, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Milk
2 tb Melted butter
Powdered sugar
6    Eggs
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
Butter 9x13 pan <not pyrex> and put into the freezer while you mix the
batter. Heat oven to 450.

Break eggs into a bowl and beat with fork.  Slowly add flour and beat
well. Add salt, milk and melted butter.  Pour into cold pan and bake
at 450 for 18 mins; then 350 for 10 mins. Sprinkle with powdered
sugar and serve with butter and syrup. This is sort of a huge piece
of French toast in a baking pan that looks like a roller coaster.  It
is fun to watch if you have a glass door oven.
