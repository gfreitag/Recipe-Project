Preheat oven to 350F.  Peel onion, slice in halfon the equator. Remove
centres leaving a bowl in the onion halves.

FILLING: In a bowl, stir together 1/2 c breadcrumbs, corn, zucchini,
carrots & beets.  Firmly pack into onion hollows.  Arrange in a
shallow baking dish & pour water around the base.

GLAZE: In a separate bowl, whisk together the glaze ingredients.
Drizzle half the mixture over the top of the onions.  Bake 30
minutes. Drizzle with remaining glaze & bake another 30 minutes.

Just before serving, sprinkle onions with remaining breadcrumbs &
broil until the crumbs are toasted & golden brown.

* The recipe doesn't state which paprika, but I would opt for the
sweeter Hungarian variety.
