Instructions:

*Dark deboned in chunks I divided recipe portions (above) to make it
easier to pre-prepare. To make Sauce, mix cornstarch and water
together. Add garlic , ginger, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and wine.
Then add broth and MSG and stir 'til sugar dissolves. Refrigerate
'til needed. In separate bowl mix chicken, soy sauce and pepper. Stir
in egg. Add cornstarch until chicken is coated evenly. Add oil to
help separate chicken pieces. Divide chicken in small quantities and
deep-fry @ 350 until crispy and light brown. (Do not overcook; watch
temp, stir fry or meat will toughen). Drain on paper towels. Place a
small amount of oil in wok and heat 'til just hot. Add onions and
peppers and stir-fry briefly (peppers will give off acrid smoke..be
careful). Stir sauce; add to wok. Add chicken and cook just 'til
sauce thickens. Add water or water/cornstarch if needed. This amount
will fill two large platters and serves 8 6-8. Serve with white
steamed rice. This recipe courtesy of Chef Paul Kaewprasart of the
Siam Rest in Columbus, OH.
