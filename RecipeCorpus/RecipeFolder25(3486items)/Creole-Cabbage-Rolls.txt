SAUCE: Mince tomatoes. Add tomato sauce, onion, garlic, sugar,
oregano, salt, pepper and basil to the pot.  Cook for 20 minutes.
(From me: Or you could use tomato sauce that you have already
prepared.) CABBAGE ROLLS: Brown meat with onions and garlic.  Drain
fat. Add peppers, celery, bay leaf, oregano and water (or red wine).
Simmer until liquid is absorbed. Add cooked rice, crumbs and egg. Add
seasonings and mix well. Add 2 tablespoons mixture on each leaf and
roll (from me: roll up a little bit, then tuck sides into center and
continue rolling). Use toothpicks to hold together (I don't think
you'll have to do this if you roll up envelope-style, which is what I
suggested). Place in greased baking dish. Pour tomato sauce on top of
rolls. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes.
