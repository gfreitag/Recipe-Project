Categories: Chicken, Appetizer, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
Milk
Flour
Chicken wings
Oil for frying
1 ea Bottle KC Masterpiece
-Original BBQ sauce
Honey to taste
Eggs
Add some honey to the BBQ sauce (to taste).  Set aside.  To prepare
the wings, prepare an egg wash by mixing together some egg and milk
(depending on how many wings you are goint to do).  In another bowl,
have some flour handy.  First, dip the wings into the egg wash, then
into the flour, back into the egg wash and back into the flour one
more time. You can either deep fry them in oil (best) or spray them
with PAM and bake them at 425 degrees until brown.  Turn them once,
spray with PAM (if you are baking them) until both sides are browned.
Once wings are brown (fried or baked), place them into a pan with
sides on it. Pour over the BBQ/honey sauce and bake them until the
wings are done. The length of time will depend on how big the wings
are. From: Ellie Collin (CMKD93F) - Prodigy Reposted by: Debbie
