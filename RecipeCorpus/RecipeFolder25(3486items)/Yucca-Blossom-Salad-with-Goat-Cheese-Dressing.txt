At thenend of the growing season, when the corn has matured, some of
the ears that have been left on the plant develop a type of edible
fungus the Indians call cuitlacoche.  Inside each corn kernel is a
moist, black paste that resembles caviar.  It can be dried or canned
and used throughout the year.  Although it is not currently enjoyed
by much of the younger generation of Native peoples, the elders
consider cuitlacoche to be a delicacy.
