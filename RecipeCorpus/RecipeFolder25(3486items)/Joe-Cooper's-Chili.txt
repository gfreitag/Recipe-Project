6 tb Chili powder
3 ts Salt
10    Garlic cloves, chopped
In a six-quart pot, sear meat in hot olive oil, stirring constantly
over high heat until grey, but not brown. Add water and mix well. Add
bay leaves now, but remove and discard after 15 minutes of cooking.
Simmer covered 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add remaining
ingredients, except for flour and cornmeal. Cocoa should be added
now. Simmer, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes. Skim off any excess
fat. Adjust seasonings and add flour and cornmeal blended with a
little cold water to make a paste. Cook, stirring constantly to
prevent sticking, until chili is the desired comsistency. COOK'S
NOTE: "Of a certainly good chili has been made from finely ground
meat if there is not ample time for hand chopping into small
bite-sized cubes. A butcher's mill with a 1/2" plate (3/4" would be
better but seldom is available) will do a very acceptable job, thank
you." FROM: The Great American Chili Cookbook
