Title: Peach Honey (Native American)
Categories: Native amer, Fruit, Condiment, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 cup
3 tb Honey
1 ts Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 lb Fresh peaches, peeled,
-pitted, and sliced, or
-dried peaches
Blend all ingredients together in a food processor for 3 minutes to
make a smooth puree.  Pour into a squeeze bottle.

Peach Honey can be kept in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 weeks.

*** NOTE *** If using dried peaches, soak them in water to cover for
1 1/2 hours, until soft and pliable. Remove the skins with your
fingers, then proceed with the recipe, adding an extra tablespoon of
honey, if necessary, to compensate for the tartness of the dried
fruit. **********************

Peach honey can accompany a variety of dishes.  I use it with the
Pinon and Blue Cornmeal Hotcakes, Feast Days Pinon Torte, and Adobe
Bread.
