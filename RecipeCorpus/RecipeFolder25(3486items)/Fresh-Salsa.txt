included tomatoes, herbs and chilies. Mexicans use it both raw and
cooked briefly in oil, lard or butter.

zucchini, or hominy; sprinkle cheese on top. Dollop on a fish fillet,
then wrap in a softened corn hush or aluminum foil and grill or
broil. Add to ceviche or to avocados for guacamole. Poach red snapper
or tile fish in the sauce and season with cumin, canela and cloves;
shred and saut the fish. Simmer in chicken stock, then stir in
cooked chicken, fried corn tortilla strips, cubed avocados and
shredded cheese.
