Title: Honey-Orange Pork Chops
Categories: Main dish, Meat, Pork
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 ts Pepper
2 cl Garlic; minced
4    Pork loin chops; cut 3/4"
-thick (about 1 1/2 lbs)
1 tb Cornstarch
1/4 ts Finely shredded orange peel
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Pineapple juice
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Honey
(I use 3/4 cup of pineapple-orange juice instead of using separate
pineapple and orange juice.)
Trim fat from chops.  For marinade, in a shallow baking dish combine
orange peel, orange juice, pineapple juice, soy sauce, honey, pepper,
and garlic. Add meat; turn to coat.  Cover; chill in the refrigerator
for 6 to 24 hours, turning once.

Remove meat from marinade, reserving marinade.  Place meat on the
unheated rack of a broiler pan.  Broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat
for 12 to 14 minutes or till no pink remains, turning once.

Transfer marinade to a saucepan.  Stir in cornstarch.  Cook and stir
until thickened and bubbly.  Cook and stir 2 minutes more.  Pass with
chops.

Grill directions:  Prepare chops as above.  Grill on an uncovered
grill directly over medium-hot coals for 12 to 14 minutes or till no
pink remains; turn once.  Continue as above.
