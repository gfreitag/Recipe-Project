Title: JALAPENO JONEY ALE
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 3 Gallons
3 1/2 lb Plain light
Dried malt extract
2 1/2 lb Clover honey
1 1/2 oz Cascade Hops
(boiling)
1/2 oz Cascade Hops
( finishing)
8    Jalapenos,
Split lengthwise
1    Or 2 pk yeast
3/4 c  Corn sugar
3 g  Water
Add the malt extract, honey, jalapenos and boiling hops to 3 gallons
of water and bring to a boil. As it reaches a boil and the odor of the
jalapenos begins to become obvious, filter out the jalapenos. Boil
for 60 minutes, add the finishing hops in the final 10 minutes.
Sparge into the fermenter, charge with the yeast when cool. Add the
corn sugar and bottle after ageing for 2 weeks. (this was a little
mild, if doing this again, I'd let the jalapenos steep a little bit
longer). WALT Curt Snyder
