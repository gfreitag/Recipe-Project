Yield: 8 Servings

1/2 ga Milk
1 c  Rice long grain
1 c  Sugar
4 tb Butter (OPTIonal)
Salt
Cinnamon
Raisins
Place Milk, Rice and Sugar and a pinch of salt into Crock on Hi. Cook
for 1 and 1/2 hours. Stir and at this time if you like raisins add
them, a couple of hands full and sprinkle in some cinnamon. Cook for
another 1 1/2 hours keeping a check on the last hour stirring often.
As soon as it starts to thicken turn it off if you like it real
creamy, let cook longer if you like it thick. It will thicken a lot
after it cools. I use skim milk, omit the butter, and sometimes if I
have it on hand add a can of evaporated milk, gives a little creamer
taste, but either way it is just as good this way and a lot less fat
etc.
