Title: JAJA FASZEROWANE (STUFFED EGG SHELLS)
Categories: Appetizers, Poland, Upload
Yield: 6 Appetizers
3 ea Eggs; hard-cooked, unpeeled
2 tb Sour cream
2 tb Bread crumbs, dry
1 tb Green onion; chopped
Salt; to taste
Pepper, black; to taste
2 tb Butter/margarine
Fold a cloth towel in several layers. Holding the towel in 1 hand,
place 1 unpeeled egg on towel. Hold egg lengthwise. With a heavy,
sharp knife, split egg lengthwise halfway through with a firm stroke
of the knife. Firmly cut the rest of the way through so shell does
not break apart. Repeat with remaining eggs. (NOTE: I START WITH MORE
THAN THE NUMBER OF EGGS REQUIRED, BUT I STILL HAVE ALL MY FINGERS).
Carefully remove egg whites and yolks from shells. Reserve shells
intact.
Chop egg whites and yolks together. Stir in sour cream, 1 tablespoon
bread crumbs and green onin. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Carefully pack equal amounts of egg mixture into each egg shell. Place
remaining bread crumbs on small plate. Dip flat surface of each
stuffed egg shell in bread crumbs. Lightly press bread crumbs into
egg mixture. Melt butter in a skillet and place stuffed egg shells,
flat-side down, in skillet. Cook over medium heat 2-3 minutes or
until lightly browned. Serve immediately.
