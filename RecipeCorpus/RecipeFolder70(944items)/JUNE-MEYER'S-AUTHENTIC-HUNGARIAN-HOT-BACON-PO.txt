Here is the Hungarian staple food, potatoes. Hungarian have made an
art of using the potato. There is a summer Potato Salad with Sour
Cream and Eggs, and a winter potato salad with hot bacon. My father
was the one that made the dressing for this dish. He would roll up
his sleeves, put on one of my mother's aprons and slice the bacon and
fry it just right. This potato salad is best made fresh and served.
Make the diners wait for the Hot Bacon Potato Salad. You do not want
it to get cold. Serve warm. Regards, June Meyer. Cook potatoes in
boiling water until tender. Peel, cut into slices, not too small, and
place in mixing bowl. Dice and fry in frying pan 1/4 lb. bacon, till
almost crisp. Do not let burn. Remove diced bacon and place into
mixing bowl with other ingredients. Peel and dice onion and place
into reserved bacon fat. Saute a few minutes. Remove sauted diced
onion with slotted spoon and place into mixing bowl. Into at least 2
Tbs. bacon fat, cook 2 Tbs. flour until smooth and bubbly, add 3 Tbs.
vinegar and 2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tsp. salt, and enough water to make a
medium sauce. (About 1 cup or more). Bring to a boil and cook until
sauce is thickened. Pour over ingredients in mixing bowl, and toss
and mix. Taste, if needed add more salt. (Vinegar and Bacon are
salty, so add salt last).

Serve with hot baked ham, or sausage. Good with a hot bean dish or
salad.

Salad serves 4.
