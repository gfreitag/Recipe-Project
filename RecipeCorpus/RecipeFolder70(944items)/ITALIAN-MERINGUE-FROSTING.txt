Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Water
2/3 c  Sugar

1/8 ts Cream of tartar
2 tb Sugar

In a 3cup saucepan, combine the water and 2/3 cup sugar. Place over
low heat to dissolve the sugar, then increase the heat to medium high
and boil, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 235
degrees. (Wash down any sugar crystals slinging to the sides of the
pan with a brush dipped in cold water.) Near the end of the boiling
time, whip the egg whites with the cream of tartaruntil soft peaks
form. Add the 2 tablespoons sugar, and continue to whip until the
whites are stiff butnot dry. With the mixer running, pour the syrup
onto the whipped whites. Continue to whip onmedium speed, about 3
minutes more. Mixture will thicken, cool and form glossy, stiff
peaks. Addthe vanilla. Cool to room temperature, about 8 to 10
minutes, then frost cake right away.
