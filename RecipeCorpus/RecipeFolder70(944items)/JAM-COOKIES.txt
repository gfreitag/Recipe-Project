Title: JAM COOKIES
Categories: Bakery, Cookies, Vegetarian, Mark's
Yield: 13 Cookies
3/4 c  Rolled oats
1 1/2 c  Wholewheat flour
1/4 c  Oil
1/2 c  Maple syrup, or other liquid
-- sweetener
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 ds Almond extract
Raspberry or other fruit jam
-- as needed
Place the oats in a blender & grind until you have a flour. Place in a
mixing bowl with the remaining ingredients. Mix well. If the mixture
seems too wet, add a little more flour. You want a dough that is
stiff enough to hold together when you place it on a cookie sheet.

Divide the dough into 13 portions.  Roll each portion in your hands
into a ball & place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Press down so
that the cookie dough is flattened & make a thumb imprint in the
centre of each cookie. Fill the indentation with jam (raspberry is my
favourite for this, but any flavour could be used).

Bake in a preheated oven at 350F for 20 minutes or until the cookies
are cooked through & lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
