Cut the potatoes into chunks if they're large.  Boil gently in salted
water, covered, or steam until tender, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Oil a 10-inch cake pan or
quiche pan and sprinkle with bread crumbs.

When the potatoes are tender, drain and place in a bowl. Add the
margine and mash with a potato masher. Gradually blend in the milk,
beating with a wooden spoon or a whisk. When the milk is
incorporated, stir in the beaten egg, salt, paprika, tomato paste,
garlic, and peper to taste. Stir in 1/4 c of the Parmesan.

Transfer to the prepared pan and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over
the top.  Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes or until the
mixture is firm and the top is browned. Remove from the heat and
allow to cool 15 minutes before slicing or cool completely, this also
tastes good room temperature.
