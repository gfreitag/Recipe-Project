Title: JACK & DILL SQUARES
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 50 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Dried dill weed, OR
1 tb Fresh, dill weed
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Oil
1/4 lb (4 ounces) Jack cheese,
Shredded (1 to 1-1/2 cups,
Loosely packed)
1/3 c  Water
"Monterey Jack cheese and dill go surprisingly well together. These
are unusual crackers with a smooth texture. They are tasty hors
d'oeurves all by themselves. 325~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven
to 325~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour, dill,
salt, and pepper. Add the oil and mix until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Add the cheese and mix thoroughly so the cheese is
coated evenly.

Slowly blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions
for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll each out to
1/8-inch.

With a sharp knife, cut the rolled dough into 2-inch squares. Place
them on an ungreased baking sheet, making sure their edges do not
touch. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn them over and continue baking
another 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are medium brown. Cool on a
rack. Yield: 50-60.

VARIATIONS: Experiment with different kinds of cheeses, seeds, and
herbs. Cheddar and thyme are a good combination.
