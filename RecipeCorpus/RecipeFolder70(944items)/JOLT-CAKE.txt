Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Unsalted butter (4 sticks)
1 c  Espresso, brewed
1 c  + 2 tb sugar
1/4 ts Orange zest, fresh
1/4 ts Orange extract
2 tb Grand Marnier
12 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
4 oz Unsweetend chocolate, chopp
8 x  Eggs, large, beaten lightly
number of servings depends on how big you like your slices. <grin> In
a small saucpan, melt the butter over moderately low heat, stir in the
espresso, the sugar, the zest, the orange extract, and the Grand
Marnier, and transfer the mixture to a bowl.  In the top of a
double-boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the semisweet and
the unsweetened chocolate, stirring occasionally.  Stir the
chocolates into the butter mixture, add the eggs, stirring until the
mixture is just combined. Line the bottom of a buttered 9" cake pan,
2" deep, with parchment paper and butter the paper. Spoon the mixture
into the pan, put the pan in a baking dish, and add enough hot water
to the dish to reach halfway up the side of the pan. Bake the cake in
the middle of preheated 350F degree oven for 1 hour. Remove the cake
from the water bath, let it cool on a rack, and chill it, covered
loosely, for 3 hours. Run a thin knife around the inside of the pan
and dip the bottom of the pan in hot water for 3 seconds. Invert a
platter over the pan, invert thecake with a sharp rap onto the
platter, and cut it with a sharp knife dipped in hot water, cleaning
the knife before cutting each slice.
