Italian Envelopes

"A Chinese won-ton wrapper around Italian ingredients results in good
American eating."

In a small bowl, combine egg, ricotta cheese, salami, mozzarella
cheese, oregano, salt and pepper.  Place a won-ton wrapper at an
angle with 1 corner facing you. Spoon about 1 TABLESPOON cheese
mixture in center of wrapper.  Lightly brush edges with water.  Fold
right and left corners inward, overlapping slightly.  Then bring
bottom and top corners together, overlapping slightly in middle.
Repeat until all ingredients are used.

Heat oil in a large skillet.  Fry a single layer of envelopes at a
time, until golden on both sides. Remove from skillet; immediately
sprinkle tops with Parmesan cheese. Drain on paper towels. Repeat
until all are cooked. Serve warm.  Makes 18 to 20 servings.

[We made these, and they turned out just fine. They're really an
appetizer or part of a varied buffet ~ don't try to use them as the
entire meal! They're too strongly flavored for that, and you'll be
sick of them by the time you've had 6 or 10.  Definitely save this
for when you're entertaining, not just deciding what's for dinner
tonight.]
