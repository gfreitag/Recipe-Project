Title: JELLIED COTTAGE CHEESE-FRUIT SALAD (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
12 oz Lime flavored gelatin
1 qt Boiling water
2 c  Pineapple and peach liquid
4 lb Uncreamed cottage cheese
40 oz Canned crushed pineapple,
Drained -- 2 (20-oz) cans
58 oz Sliced peaches, drained -- 2
(29-oz) cans
Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and
seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing,
and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about
6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing
packages from the pans.

TO THAW FROZEN SALADS:  Remove freezer wrap.  Place food in baking
pan. Thaw in refigerator for about 24 hours. Serve on crisp salad
greens.
