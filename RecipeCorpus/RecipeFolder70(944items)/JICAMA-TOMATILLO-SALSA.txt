Prepare jicama; it can be diced finely or coarsely as desired -- 1/2
inch dice is typical.  Place in a large mixing bowl. To prepare
tomatillos, cut ends off, remove insides and dice skins. Add to
jicama in mixing bowl. Add jalapeno, cilantro, garlic, and shallots.
Mix all ingredients and adjust seasoning with lemon and lime juice,
salt and pepper. Add peanut oil and toss to coat mixture.  Correct
spiciness and heat by adding jalapeno vinegar. To make jalapeno
vinegar, drop scraps and trimmings from 3 jalapenos into 1 cup white
vinegar in a non-aluminum pan, bring to a boil, let cool and strain.
Let sit until completely cool. Store in refrigerator. From:

originated with Peter Rosenberg, chef/owner of DelicaTexas Food
Creations Catering. It was one of the salsas served with a seared
snapper dish, but can be used on its own as a dip or salsa. The
jicama gives it a fresh crunch.
