DOUGH: In large bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, curry powder,

Drizzle in water, stirring with fork and adding up to 2 tb more water

FILLING: In skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat; cook onion, green
onions, garlic and cayenne pepper for 3 minutes or until softened.
Remove with slotted spoon and set aside. Over high heat, saute beef
for 5 minutes or until no longer pink; drain off fat. Return onion
mixture to pan along with curry powder, thyme, tumeric, salt and
pepper; cook for 3 minutes over medium heat. Pour in water; bring to
a boil. Add crumbs; simmer for 3 minutes or until slightly thickened
but still juicy. Let cool. *(Can be covered and refrigerated for up

Divide dough into 16 pieces. On floured pastry cloth and using
stockinette-covered rolling pin, roll out each piece into 5-inch
circle. Brush edges of top half with water; place 2 heaping tbsp of
filling in the centre. Fold in half, pressing edges togther with fork
to seal. Prick twice; place on ungreased baking sheet. *(Patties can
