Title: JAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Ground allspice
1 tb Dried 4hyme
1 1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 ts Ground sage
3/4 ts Ground nutmeg
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
2 tb Salt
2 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Soy sauce
3/4 c  White vinegar
1/2 c  Orange juice
1 x  Juice of 1 lime
1 ea Scotch bonnet pepper,
1 x  Seeded and finely chopped
1 c  Chopped white onion
3 ea Green onions, finely chopped
4 ea Chicken breasts (6 to 8 oz e
1 x  Trimmed of fat
In a large bowl, combine the allspice, thyme, cayenne pep- per,
black pepper, sage, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, garlic powder and sugar.
With a wire whisk, slowly add the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar,
orange juice, and lime juice.  Add the Scotch bonnet pepper,. onion,
and green onions and mix well.  Add the chicken breasts, cover and
marinate for at least 1 hour, longer if possible.
Preheat an outdoor grill.
Remove the breasts from the marinade and grill for 6 minutes on
each side or until fully cooked.  While grilling, baste with the
marinade.
Heat the leftover marinade and serve on the side for dipping.
NOTE:  This is the recipe as listed in the cookbook. Per-
sonally, I would NEVER heat the leftover marinade and serve on the
side for dipping, especially something that you had marinated POULTRY
in. A MUCH better idea would be to reserve some of the marinade
(BEFORE you put the chicken in it) and save it for serving.
This recipe is also from Sugar Reef Caribbean Cooking by Devra
Dedeaux. "This recipe is not as hot as you would find in Jamaica. For
that authentic flavor, double the quantity of dry spices."
