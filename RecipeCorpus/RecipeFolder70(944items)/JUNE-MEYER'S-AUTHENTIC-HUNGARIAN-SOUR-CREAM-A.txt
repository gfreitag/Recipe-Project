Categories: Sauce, Hungary
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Sour cream

Sour cream is a staple in a hungarian kitchen. Practically every meal
has something made with sour cream, soup, salad, goulash, pancakes,
vegetables, desserts and sauces. This simple sauce is a mainstay when
ever we have hungarian sausage, or boiled beef. Regards, June Meyer.

Mix together in small sauce bowl. Add more horse-radish if you like it
stonger, more sour cream and sugar if you like it milder. Makes 2
cups.

Serve at room temperature with boiled beef from HUNGARIAN BEEF SOUP
recipe.

Serve at room temperature with boiled chicken from HUNGARIAN CHICKEN
SOUP recipe.
