This coffee cake consists of balls of coffee cake dough made in a
round tube cake-pan with nuts, cinnamon and a syrup-like glaze on the
outside. This recipe is not a quick one. It uses yeast in the dough
and that means a 2 1/2 to 3 hours spent in raising the dough. It is a
good recipe for a lazy Saturday or Sunday. I always double the recipe
to make two. One for the freezer and one for afternoon coffee.
Regards, June Meyer.

Mix sour cream, sugar, salt and yeast. Stir until yeast dissolves. Add
eggs, softened butter and half the flour. Mix well and add rest of
flour. Turn dough out on floured board and knead until smooth for
about 10 to 15 minutes. Place in greased bowl. Cover and let rise in
warm place until double in bulk for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch
dough down. Turn over and let rise again for 45 minutes. After second
rising, form into walnut-sized balls. Melt butter in small cup. Dip
each ball in melted butter and roll in sugar and walnut and cinnamon
mixture. Place in layers in 10-inch greased tube pan. Sprinkle any
remaining sugar-nut mixture or melted butter over the top layer of
balls. Cover pan with waxed paper and towel and let dough rise again
45 minutes. Bake 40 to 50 minutes at 375 degrees or until golden
brown. Run spatula around sides of coffee cake, and invert onto
plate. To serve, break coffee cake apart with two forks.
