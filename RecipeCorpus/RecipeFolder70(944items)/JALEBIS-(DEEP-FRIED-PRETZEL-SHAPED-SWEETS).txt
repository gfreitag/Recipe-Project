Categories: India, Desserts, Vegetarian
Yield: 5 Dozen
MMMMM--------------------------JALEBIS-------------------------------
3 c  Flour, all-purpose
1/4 c  Flour, rice
1/4 ts Baking powder
2 c  Water; lukewarm
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
4 c  Sugar, granulated
3 c  Water; cold
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
2 ts Food coloring, yellow
1/8 ts Food coloring, red
1 ts Rose water
x  Oil, vegetable
Batter: In deep bowl, make a smooth batter of the flours, baking
powder and lukewarm water. Let batter rest unrefrigerated and
uncovered 12 hours.
Syrup: Immediately before frying the jalebis, combine sugar, cold
water and cream of tarter in 4 qt. saucepan. Stir over moderate heat
until sugur dissolves. Increase heat to high and cook briskly,
undisturbed for 5 minutes, until 220F on a candy thermometer. Remove
from heat, stir in coloring and rose water. Pour into a bowl and set
aside.
Jalebis: Pour 3 cups vegetable oil into a 10" karhai or 12" wok or
into a deep fryer to 2-3 inches. Heat oil to 350F. Spoon 1 1/2 cups
of the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a plain tube 3/16"
diameter. Squeezing batter directly into hot oil, loop a stream of
batter back and forth 4-5 times to form a sort of pretzel made up of
alternating figure 8s and circles, one over the other. Each jalebi
should be about 3" long and 2" wide.
In batches of 5-6, fry the jalebis for 2 minutes, or until golden
on both sides. As they brown, transfer them to the syrup for a
minute, then place them on a plate. Serve warm or at room temperature.
