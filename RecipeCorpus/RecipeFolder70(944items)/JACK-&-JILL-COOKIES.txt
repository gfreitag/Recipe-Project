Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 36 Cookies
1 c  Butter or margarine; soft
3/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour

-- (quick or old-fashioned)
Beat butter until creamy.  Gradually add sugar, beating until fluffy.
Blend in egg and vanilla.  Sift together flour, soda and salt. Add to
creamed mixture; blend well.  Stir in oats.  For ease in handling,
chill dough about 1 hour.

Shape to form 1-inch balls.  Place on ungreased cooky sheets. Flatten
slightly with bottom of glass dipped in sugar. Insert flat wooden
stick or wooden skewer into each. Bake in preheated moderate oven
(375 F.) 10 to 12 minutes; cool.

Frost cookies with confectioners' sugar frosting. Attach chocolate
shot for hair and gumdrop pieces for eyes, nose and mouth. For girl
cookies, pipe a bow onto hair with thick frosting. Tie a ribbon bow
onto stick for boy's bow tie.

When frosting is set, insert sticks into large gumdrops so that
cookies stand up.
