Title: JACK DANIELS CHOCOLATE CHIP PECAN PIE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Extra large eggs, slightly
-beaten
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Butter, melted
1 c  Dark corn syrup
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Jack Daniels
1/2 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 c  Whole pecans
1    10-inch pie crust, unbaked
Preheat oven to 375 degrees (F).  Combine eggs, sugar, butter, syrup,
and whiskey.  Mix well and strain [I dont strain, w/no ill effects].
Sprinkle most of the chips over bottom of crust. Cover with pecans.
Pour filling over chips and pecans. Sprinkle top with remaining
chips. Bake 35-40 minutes or until knife inserted halfway between
center and the edge comes out clean [chips sprinkled on top will make
this difficult ~- they melt.] Let cool 30 min before cutting. Makes
6-8 servings.
