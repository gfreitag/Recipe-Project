Title: ITALIAN TIDBITS
Categories: Appetizers, Italian
Yield: 1 Servings  . All you do is skewer on a toothpick....a small cube of mozzarella or
provolone; a small cube of peperoni; and a piece of sun-dried tomato.
If you have fresh basil leaves, you can wrap the whole package in a
basil leaf before skewering it.

I brought these to a party once and didn't have any left to take home!
