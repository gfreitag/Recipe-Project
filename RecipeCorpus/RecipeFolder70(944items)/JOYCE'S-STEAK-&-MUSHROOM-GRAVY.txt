Title: JOYCE'S STEAK & MUSHROOM GRAVY
Categories: Improv, Kohl, Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
Good round steak, trimmed &
-cut into serving portions
Flour
Salt and pepper
Cream of mushroom soup
Cooking oil or shortening
Salt and pepper each side of the steak pieces. Roll thoroughly in
flour, coating each side heavily. Fry in hot oil until each side is
browned (steak doesn't have to be done...just brown). As each piece
is browned, remove from the skillet and set aside. While the steak is
frying, open the mushroom soup...at least 2 cans..and put the soup in
a bowl. Stir it up to smooth it...then gradually add equal amounts of
water, keeping the mixture smooth. Transfer the steak into a large
pot. Pour the mushroom soup mixture in with the steak. Bring to a
boil, then cover and simmer for at least 1-2 hours or longer. You
should be able to cut the steak with a fork, so the thicker the
pieces, the longer you cook it. You may also add some milk and/or
water, but not too much. The soup becomes the gravy, so let it boil
own to gravy consistency. You can also put this in the oven to cook.

Suggestions: Serve with buttery mashed potatoes, fresh green beans,
and a salad.

NOTE: Even people who ordinarily do not like mushrooms like this!
In fact, if you don't tell them about the mushrooms, chances
are they won't even know it....
