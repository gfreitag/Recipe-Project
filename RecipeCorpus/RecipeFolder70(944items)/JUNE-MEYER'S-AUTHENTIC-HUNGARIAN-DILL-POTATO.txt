Dill plants, green and feathery, tall and swaying in the breeze
perfuming the air in the garden. Whole bunches of dill, three feet
long or more hang drying in the summer kitchen waiting for the
harvest canning to begin. Dill is still a staple in our household.
Today, I buy bunches at the suppermarket and roll and wrap the fronds
tightly in aluminum foil to store in my freezer for use all year
round in salads, sauces, dips and soups.

This Dill Potato Salad Recipe is my favorite. It is full of fresh dill
flavor. It is simple to make, embarassingly quick and mouthwatering.
Regards, June Meyer. Cook potatos in pot of salted water till tender.
Cool enough to handle and peel. Slice potatos as for salad. Put
potatos into a bowl. Add diced onion. Add minced fresh Dill. Pour oil
and vinegar over ingredients in bowl. sprinkle 1 tsp. suger over all
and toss to mix. Taste and adjust seasoning. More salt or more sugar
if needed. Serve at room temperature. Serves 4. Walt
