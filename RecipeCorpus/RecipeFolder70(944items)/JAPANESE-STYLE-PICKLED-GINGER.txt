Title: JAPANESE STYLE PICKLED GINGER
Categories: Japanese, Pickles
Yield: 1 Bottle
10 oz 300 gr sliced ginger
1 c  Rice vinegar
1/2 c  Or more sugar
1 tb Salt
1/3 c  Water
Soak 300 gms sliced ginger in ice water with a little vinegar for a
few hours.  Drain. The ginger should then be blanched in salty
boiling water, drained, and allowed to cool.

Bring remaining ingredients to a boil and let cool.

After the mixture has cooled, add it to the ginger. Refrigerate.

Mark

p.s. I use a vegetable peeler to slice the ginger nice and thin; a
food processor does not work!
