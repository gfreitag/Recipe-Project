mixture until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Pat the mixture evenly over the
bottom of an ungreased 9 X 13 X 2 inch baking dish. Spread the pecans
evenly over this mixture. Combine the 2/3 cup butter with the
remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a medium saucepan. Heat to boiling,
stirring constantly, over medium heat. Boil 1 minute. Spread evenly
over crust in pan. Bake until golden and bubbly, about 18 minutes.
Remove the bars from the oven and immediately sprinkle the chocolate
bits over the top. Allow to melt slightly and then, using the sharp
point of a knife, cut through the chocolate, making swirls. Do not
spread the chocolate. Cool completely on a wire rack before cutting
into bars. MAKES: ABOUT 36 BROWNIES
