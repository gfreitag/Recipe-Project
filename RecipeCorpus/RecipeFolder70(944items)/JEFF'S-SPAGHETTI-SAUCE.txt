I rarely actually measure the ingredients, so they vary from sauce to
sauce.

Combine all except the grated Parmesan cheese.  Simmer covered, 30
minutes over low heat.  Add grated Parmesan (Kraft shaker style is
fine) and simmer additional 15 minutes.

Serve over hot pasta noodles.  Sprinkle more cheese on top.

I have also substituted 3 or 4 drops Tabasco Sauce for the lemon
juice.

Vary spice quantities to suit taste.

Enjoy! - Jeff Duke
