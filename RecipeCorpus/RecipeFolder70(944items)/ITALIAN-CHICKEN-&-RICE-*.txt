My notes: Convenient and tasty! I used chicken pieces from a whole
chicken. I made it up the night before and left it in the fridge
until I got home from work. For next time: Add more rice, more
tomatoes (just to make it go further), and it would still be good
with less Velveeta (to make it less expensive).
