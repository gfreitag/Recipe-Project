Prepare an ice bath.  Bring 2 cups water to a boil. Add a pinch of
salt. Blanch the green beans for 1 minute. Drain and plunge into the
ice bath. Drain and pat dry. Reserve.

Drain the tuna of its oil.  Place it in a bowl and flake it with a
fork. Add the green beans and all the other ingredients and toss
well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chill before serving.

Judi's Notes:  Serve as a salad or eat as a sandwich.

As suggested by the author, I made a couple of open faced sandwiches
with crusty french bread using this mixture. It was delicious. I
mixed a little olive oil, lemon juice, and a clove of minced garlic
together and spread it on the bread, then placed the tuna mixture on
top. It serves 2 people but found the amount not to be enough. Double
ingredients if you are hungry! Adapted recipe from: Salads by Leonard
Schwartz.
