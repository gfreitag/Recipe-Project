Categories: Pastry, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
Pie pastry dough for 2 crust
3 c  Blueberries
1/3 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/8 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Half&half
3 c  Blackberries
2 1/2 c  Raspberries
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1 tb Unsalted butter, in bits
Ice cream as accompaniment
Roll out half the dough 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface,
fit it into a 9 inch deep dish pie plate and trim edge, leaving a 1/2
inch overhang. Chill the shell while making the filling. In a large
bowl, toss together the berries, cornstarch, 1 1/2 cups sugar, lemon
juice, nutmeg, and cinnamon until combined well. Mound the filling in
the shell and dot with butter. Roll out remaining dough into a 13 ~
14 inch round on a lightly floured surface. Drape it over the filling
and trim, leaving a 1 inch overhang. Fold the overhang under the
bottom crust, pressing the edge to seal it.  Crimp the edge
decoratively.  Brush the crust with h&h, make slits in the top crust
and sprinkle with sugar. Bake on a large cookie sheet in a preheated
425f oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375f and bake for 35 - 40
minutes more or until crust is golden and filling is bubbling. Serve
with ice cream.
