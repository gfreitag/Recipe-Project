Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN DILL SAUCE F
Categories: Hungary, Sauce
Yield: 2 Servings
1 1/2 tb Soft butter
1 1/2 tb Flour
1 c  Milk or water or stock
1 1/2 ts Good vinegar
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Fresh dill chopped
1/8 ts Salt
Dill grows wild in most Hungarian gardens. Year after year it keeps
reseeding itself. It grows to great heights. Cool green lacey fronds,
pungent with the familiar aroma, waiting to be stripped for sauces and
salads. Mature plants top heavy with seed heads will be hung upside
down in the canning kitchen to dry for squash and pickles. This dill
sauce has a creamed base, is sweet-sour and served hot over boiled
beef and vegetables after the HUNGARIAN BEEF SOUP has been consumed.
Also serve hot over boiled chicken after the HUNGARIAN CHICKEN SOUP
has been consumed.

Regards, June Meyer.

You are going to make a basic cream sauce. Start by melting the
butter in a saucepan. Sprinkle the flour over the butter, stir and
cook until the mixture foams up. Do not let it brown. Stir in the
milk, water or stock and cook stirring so no lumps form. When
thickened, stir in vinegar, sugar, fresh dill and salt. Taste and
adjust seasoning if needed. Makes over 1 cup. This recipe can be
doubled or trippled if more is needed.
