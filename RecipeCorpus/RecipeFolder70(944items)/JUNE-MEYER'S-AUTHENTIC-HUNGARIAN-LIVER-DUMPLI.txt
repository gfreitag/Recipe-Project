Great Aunt Miller was my Grandfather Seine's sister. A wonderful
cook, she was a large woman and hard of hearing. It seems like she
was always shouting as though we were the ones that were deaf. But
when she shouted "liver dumplings ready" we were already seated
patiently at the table. We waited for a large bowl of chicken soup,
full of chicken bits, and wonderful liver dumplings. Nothing can
compare with the taste of those fresh parsley and chicken liver
dumplings, cut into the simmering soup. Easy to make, hard to forget.
Regards, June Meyer. Cream butter and egg very throughly. Add flour
till you have a nice dough. You may add a little more flour if
needed. Grate the onion into the dough. Finely chop parsely into
dough. Add 1/2 tea. salt and dash of pepper. Chop liver very fine.
Add liver to dough. Cut into soup with teaspoon when the soup boiling.

Serves 4.
