Finalist in 1980 Recipe Contest: JO STALLARD, Pacific Grove, CA.

"I'll never live this down;' teased grandmotherly Jo Stallard as she
was crowned with a tiara of fresh garlic and draped in garlic
wreaths. A vegetarian, Jo has turned her cooking talents to adapting
recipes for meatless cooking. This delicious soup has always been a
winner with her friends, she says, and so it was, too, with the 1980
Great Garlic Cook-off celebrity judges.

Generously butter inside of 3-quart baking dish. Combine all
ingredients, except cheese and cream, in dish. Cover and bake for 1
hour at 375 degrees. Stir in cheeses and cream, lower heat to 325
degrees and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer. Do not allow to boil.
Mmmmm- GOOD! Serves 4 to 6.
