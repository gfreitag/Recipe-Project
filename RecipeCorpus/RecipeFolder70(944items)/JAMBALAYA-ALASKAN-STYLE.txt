Title: JAMBALAYA ALASKAN-STYLE
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 1 Recipe
1/4 lb Bacon; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 md Onion; chopped
1 md Green pepper; chopped
1/4 lb Hot reindeer Polish sausage
-- cut in 1/4" slices
1/4 lb Reindeer Polish sausage
- (regular)
-- cut in 1/4" slices
1 tb Parsley
1/2 ts Thyme
Lemon pepper seasoning
Salt
Pepper
2 c  Beef or chicken broth
1 ds Tabasco sauce
1 1/4 c  Long-grain rice
1 1/2 c  Fresh or frozen shrimp
-- cooked
Saute bacon, garlic, onion and green pepper 2 to 3 minutes in large
skillet or kettle. Add hot and regular sausages. Saute until onion is
translucent but not golden. Add parsley, thyme, lemon pepper, salt
and pepper. Add broth and tabasco sauce; bring to a boil and boil
five minutes. Add rice, cover and simmer 20 minutes until rice is
tender but not mushy. Stir in shrimp and heat until just heated
through. Serves 4. Serve with a cool, tangy coleslaw and plenty of
cold beer-or something else to quench the fire! Those with timid
palates may want to substitute regular sausage for the hot; those
with cast-iron palates can use all hot sausage or add tabasco sauce
to taste. This recipe is moderately hot.
