I find it amusing that in my kitchen, I have all the latest culinary
gadgets, from coffee bean grinders, cusinarts, can openers, coffee
makers, juicers, and so on, to aid me in my cooking adventures, yet
when I want cole slaw I get out my hand held "Rapid Slaw Cutter"
(cica 1950). Made by the Bluffton Slaw Cutter Co. Bluffton, Ohio.
This non-technical hand held cutter sold for about 39 cents way back
then. It cuts the cabbage into delicate strands of slaw. Better than
any Cusinart can. If you frequent garage sales, or estate sales, you
may be lucky enough to find a used one. Frequent use will keep it
sharp. My cutter is willed to my son. Regards, June Meyer.

Wash hands and take off rings. Place your hands into the slaw, mix and
squeeze the slaw so it makes some juice. This will make the slaw limp.
Taste, add more salt if needed. Refrigerate till serving time. Good
the next day also. Serves 4 to 6.

If you try one of my recipes please tell me what you think.
