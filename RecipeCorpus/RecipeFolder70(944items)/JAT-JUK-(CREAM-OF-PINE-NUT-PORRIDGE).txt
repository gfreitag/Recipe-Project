Title: JAT JUK (CREAM OF PINE NUT PORRIDGE)
Categories: Soups, Korean
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Pine nuts
1 c  Water
4    Dried jujubes (korean dates)
-soaked in water 2 hours
2 ts Honey
1/4 c  Rice flour; dissolved in 1/2
-cup water; left 5 minutes
1/4 ts Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
"The porridge, it is not quite a soup, is usually served on three
different occasions. The first is for breakfast as a special treat,
since pine nuts are expensive everywhere. The second is as a restorer
of strength for persons who are ill or debilitated. The third
occasion is as a snack anytime of day when special friends meet --
not the tea or coffee hour but pine-nut soup time."

1. Grind the pine nuts in a processor with 1/2 cup water for about 1/2
minute. Add the balance of the water and process the mixture until
smooth. Pour through a metal strainer and rub the particles through,
preferably with a wooden spoon. Discard the small amount of residue,
which is mostly the "eyes" or buds of the pine nuts.

2. When the jujubes are ready, cut out and discard the pits. Cut the
jujubes into thin slices and mix with the honey. Set aside.

3. Simmer the rice flour paste in a pan over low heat, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture just starts to
bubble. This is the soup thickener.

4. Add the pine nut mixture, the sugar and salt to the rice flour and
bring to a low boil for 2 minutes. The lightly thickened porridge,
smooth and creamy, is now ready.

Pour it into individual bowls and garnish with a teaspoon of the
jujube and honey.

Serve warm.
