Title: JEFF'S CHOCOLATE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING
Categories: Frostings, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Cream Cheese -- softened
4 oz Butter -- softened
1 c  Cocoa Powder
4 c  Powdered Sugar
2    To 3 Tbsp.
Cream -- or milk
Cream the cheese and butter in your mixer. Sift or stir 1 cup of the
sugar with the cocoa powder and mix into the cheese and butter. Add
some cream if the stuff gets too dry. Continue adding sugar, and
cream as needed, to a spreadable consistency. Beat well to get all
the lumps out.

The exact measurements for the dry stuff is unimportant. Sometimes
(OK, all the time!-), for a more bittersweet flavor, I will add more
cocoa powder to taste
