In summer we usually made and ate cold Sour Cream Potato Salad. In
winter we made and ate Hot Bacon Potato Salad. This is a traditional
Hungarian summer Potato Salad, made with sour cream instead of
mayonnaise. It seems my teen aged life was spent in peeling potatoes
either cooked or raw. We made tons of Potato Salad. It was
inexpensive, it kept well, and everyone liked it. It also went well
with everything from plain cooked hot dogs, to home baked hams.
Regards, June Meyer. Wash potatoes and cook in boiling water until
tender. Do not over cook or salad will get mushy. Drain potatoes,
cool and peel. Slice into small pieces and place in mixing bowl with
minced onion, sliced celery, chopped eggs, and diced pimento. Into
bowl with these ingredients place the sour cream, vinegar, sugar and
salt. Mix all with two large spoons, or as grandma did with your
hands. Taste, if more salt is needed, add and add a few dashes of
pepper. Let the Potato Salad rest in the refrigerator for a few hours
to blend flavors. Put into a serving dish. Sprinkle a little Paprika
on top and sprinkle some chopped flat parsley on for beauty. Serve
cold.
