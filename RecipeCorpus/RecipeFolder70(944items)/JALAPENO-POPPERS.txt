SEE BELOW
Leave the stem on! Cut a narrow slit along one side and scoop out
seeds and ribs. I swirl a chopstick around through the slit to do
this and then shake out the seeds (save & dry them of course). Then
blanch them. Cool, then stuff w/ grated Pepper Jack & Cheddar
cheeses. Freeze peppers for 1 hr(minimum)! Using stems as handle,
coat FROZEN peppers in a corn-bread batter and drop into a fryer one
at a time. Remove when golden and crispy! Let cool for 5 minutes(the
cheese gets really hot) then serve w/ your favorite salsa.
