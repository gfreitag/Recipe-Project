Meatloaf - Fourth Prize Preheat oven to 350F. Mush first 14
ingredients together by hand until well mixed and put into a bread
pan. Stick knife in three places so meatloaf cooks evenly. Bake for
30 minutes. Increase heat to 400F for 20 minutes. Remove from oven
and drain juice from pan. Sprinkle all the Monterey jack cheese
evenly over the top of the meatloaf and return to oven for 15 to 20
minutes or until the cheese starts to bubble. Watch carefully so
cheese doesn't burn. The meatloaf will have shrunk enough so that the
cheese melted over all sides gives a frosted effect.
