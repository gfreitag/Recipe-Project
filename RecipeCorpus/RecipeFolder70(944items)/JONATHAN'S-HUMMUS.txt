Title: JONATHAN'S HUMMUS
Categories: None
Yield: 20 Servings
38 oz Chickpeas
8 oz Sesame tahini
2/3 c  Reconstituted lemon juice
2/3 c  Finely chopped fresh parsley
3/16 c  Tamari
2/3 ts Paprika
1/3 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
Drain chickpeas.  Place in large bowl and mash thoroughly. Pour off
as much oil as possible from the tahini, then add the tahini to the
chickpeas. Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly with masher,
adding up to 1/3 cup water until desired consistency is achieved:
halfway between stiff and soupy.

Cover and refrigerate overnight or for several hours to allow flavors
to blend and mellow.  Taste and re-season if necessary.

Use as a dip with vegetables, pita wedges, or crackers, or as a
sandwich spread with tomato, cucumber, or pepper slices.
