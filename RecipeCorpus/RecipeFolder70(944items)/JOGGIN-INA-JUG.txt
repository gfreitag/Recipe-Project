Title: JOGGIN INA JUG
Categories: Beverages, Health
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Apple juice
1 c  Grape juice
1    Or 2 Tbs apple cider vinegar
-(some use 1 until they get
-used to the vinegar taste)
Some folks also add a cup of cranberry juice to the above. Keep
pouring the portions in a quart or gallon jug. Seems to last forever.
The "Joggin' In a Jug" mixture has a higher vinegar taste than the
above recipe. This is an old folk's remedy that comes out of Vermont.
A man named Dr. Jarvis (if memory serves me correct) spread the news
all over Vermont about the benefits of taking apple cider vinegar.
The older (and smarter) folks mix one tablespoon of apple cider
vinegar in a glass of room temperature water then add one tablespoon
of honey to that. The apple cider vinegar acts like a rotor rooter in
your veins and the honey gives energy. You'll notice a remarkable
improvement in your energy level after a month.
