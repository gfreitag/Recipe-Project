In old world families, "Hamburgers for dinner" meant a hearty mound of
meat, fried in fat until it had a rich brown crust. It was served as
a meal for dinner, along with a vegetable dish, and mashed potato. In
Austria-Hungary the Hamburger was carried to new heights. This was
not a simple "make a thin flat patty and fry" recipe. Regards, June
Meyer.

Saute chopped onion in a little fat or oil. Wet bread with water,
tear into small pieces. In mixing bowl beat eggs well. Add meat,
bread and the rest of the ingredients and mix lightly with your
hands. Form mixture into medium sized balls, about 5 or 6. Flatten
slightly.

Fry SLOWLY in 1/2 inch of Crisco, lard or oil until tender and all
sides are nicely browned and some what crispy. Let each side cook
before attemping to turn with spatula.

Serve hamburgers hot along with a potato and vegetable dish, and
perhaps Hungarian cucumber salad. Serves 4 (you can double the recipe
for robust eaters. Leftovers are good the next day cold!) Honest!
