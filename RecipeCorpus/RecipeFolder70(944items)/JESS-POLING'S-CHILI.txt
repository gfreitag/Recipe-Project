Fat grams    per serving:
tbsp oil, add onions, bell peppers and celery and cook until
transparent. Add beef and brown thoroughly, stirring often. Drain off
excess grease. Add tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, tomato paste (to
thicken), and two tomato sauce cans water. Add chili powder, and stir
thoroughly. Add salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, and stir. Add chili
sauce and hot green chili and stir. Simmer on low heat for 5 to 6
hours. If chili begins to stick, add water, stir often. You may cut
down cooking time, but, the longer you let it simmer, the better the
chili will be. Some people will tell you if you cook with beans it is
not chili. For those people I say.....You cook chili your way and
I'll cook mine my way (VBGrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnnn). If you want to add
beans to this recipe, do so, I prefer the Sun Vista Pinto Beans.
Served with homemade bread or French bread and salad makes for a
complete meal. This recipe will serve approximately 20 persons. By
