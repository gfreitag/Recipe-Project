Title: JELLO SHOOTERS
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Box jello
1/3 c  Bacardi rum
Follow the directions for 1 small box of "Cherry Jell-O and use the
method for quick cooling. That is, rather than 1 cup of water, use 6
ice cubes and let them totally melt. Add 1/3 cup Bacardi 151 Rum.
Spray thirteen 2 ounce plastic cups with "Pam". The "Pam" allows the
Jell-O to come out much easier. Pour the Jell-O mixture into each of
the cups. Put'em into the "fridge" and let'em set for a couple of
hours.
