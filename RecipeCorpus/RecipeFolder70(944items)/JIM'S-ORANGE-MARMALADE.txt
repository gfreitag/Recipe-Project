Title: JIM'S ORANGE MARMALADE
Categories: Preserves
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Seville oranges (about 5)
1    Lemon
6 c  Water
7 1/2 c  Sugar
Directions: Put 4 small saucers in freezer. In a very large pot,
combine oranges, lemon and water. Cover and bring to a simmer. Let
simmer 2 hours. DON'T ALLOW TO BOIL. Turn off heat. Remove fruit. Let
cool 5 minutes. Cut in half and scoop pulp, seeds and pith back into
pan. Put shells to one side.  Bring pan to a boil and boil hard 5
minutes. Strain through damp cheese cloth in a seive. Gather ends and
squeeze out remaining juice. You should have 6 cups. Make up any
difference with water. Return liquid to pan.  Remove all white pith
from skins. Cut skins in fine strips (or as desired) and add to pan
with sugar. Place over low heat and stir to dissolve sugar.  Bring to
boil. Boil hard, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Boil
hard til jell point is reached, between 60 and 90 minutes depending
on natural fruit pectin available. Jell point test. Chill some
saucers in freezer while preparing marmalade, 2 or 3. Test: drop a
small amount of hot marmalade on chilled plate and chill for 2
minutes. Run finger through marmelade on plate.  If surface wrinkles,
it has reached jelling point.  If still syrupy, continue boiling.
Repeat test at 5 minute intervals til jell point is reached.  Remove
pan from stove and stir for 5 minutes, skimming off any foam. Ladle
into sterilized jars, leaving 1/2 inch head space. Seal as you like
