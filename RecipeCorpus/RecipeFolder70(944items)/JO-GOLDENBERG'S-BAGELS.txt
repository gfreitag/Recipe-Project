PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Mix yeast, 1 1/2 ounces sugar and warm water.
Let stand 2-or-3 minutes. Mix 2 cups flour and the salt and add to
the yeast mixture. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups flour. Knead for 5
minutes, adding flour if dough sticks to the table. Bagel dough
should be firm. Place dough in a clean, greased bowl. Cover and let
rise until double. Bring water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon sugar.
Divide dough into 12 pieces and shape each into a ball. Allow the
dough to relax 3-to-4 minutes. Flatten with your palm. With your
thumb, press deep into the center of the bagel and tear open with
your fingers. Pull the hole open. Place bagels on a sheet and cover
for about 10 minutes. Put 2-or-3 bagels at a time into simmering
water for about 45 seconds, turning once. Drain and place on greased
baking sheets. Brush with beaten egg white and sprinkle with salt,
sesame, poppy or caraway seeds. Bake for 35 minutes, turning over
when bagels are light brown. Bagels are done when they are brown and
shiny. Cool on a rack.
