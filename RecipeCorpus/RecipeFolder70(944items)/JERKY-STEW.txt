Title: JERKY STEW
Categories: Stews, Native amer
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Jerky, beef or buffalo
1 c  Whole dried hominy, soaked
-overnight in ample water
1 lg Yellow onion, peeled/chopped
1 lb Potatoes*, unpeeled/diced
Salt and pepper to taste
*Native Americans would have used prairie potatoes -- arrowhead
(Sagittaria latifolia).

Break the jerky up into 1-inch pieces and place in a heavy, lidded
kettle. Drain the hominy and add to the jerky, along with the onion.
Cover with water and bring to a boil. Simmer, covered, until the
hominy is tender, about 2 hours. You will have to watch this closely,
as more water will have to be added as you go along. Add the potatoes
and cook for an additional 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
