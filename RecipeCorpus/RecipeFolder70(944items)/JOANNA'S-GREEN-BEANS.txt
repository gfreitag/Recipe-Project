3 tb Olive oil
1/2 md Onion; very finely chopped
2    Red bell peppers; julienned

1 lb Green beans; trimmed

Melt butter.  Add 2 tb. of the oil and heat gently. Add onion and red
pepper.  Saute slowly over medium low heat until peppers are
tender-crisp and onion is translucent and tender. Remove 1/2 of this
mixture and reserve.

Add last tb. of the oil to the pepper and onion mixture remaining in
the skillet.  Continue to saute over low heat for 4 or 5 more
minutes, until onions are very soft and beginning to caramelize. Add
chicken broth and lemon juice, put the mixture in a food processor or
blender and process until creamy.

Steam green beans until tender; drain.  Combine green beans, reserved
sauteed pepper and onion and the onion/pepper puree. Salt. Heat
through and serve.

Shepherd writes: "With caramelized onions and sauteed peppers, this
green bean dish tastes rich and looks beautiful."
