Categories: Low-cal, Pizza
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Recipe for pizza dough
1 sm Can crushed tomatoes
Zuchini
Onion
Brocolli
Mushrooms
Tomatoe
1 c  Low fat mozzerella
Make your favorite pizza dough.  Roll out on a floured surface. Fitt
on to aluminum pizza pan(do not use oil). Cut off excess dough off
the sides. Pinch up sides to make a crust. Spread plain crushed
tomatoes over the dough as the sauce.  Put your toppings on as
desired. Top with Low fat cheese.  Bake @ 450 F for 15-20 minutes or
until cheese is bubbly and crust is brown.

Note: The taste of the vegetables will compensate for the lack of
seasonings in the sauce.  Be creative with your toppings, but
remember that olives are caloric and anchovies are usualy packed in
oil. Pepperonni is NOT a meat you want to be eating if you are trying
to loose wieght. The reason for the absence in seasonings in the
sauce is because I have found when I buy pizza sauce, it usually
contains oil. You may season your crushed tomatoes if you like.
