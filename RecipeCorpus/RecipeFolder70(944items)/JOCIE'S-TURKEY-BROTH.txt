Categories: Poultry
Yield: 12 Servings
4    Whole Turkey Wings
6 qt Water -- or to cover meat
4    Whole Carrots -- thinly
Sliced
4    Whole Celery Ribs -- thinly
Sliced
1 lg Onion -- thinly sliced
5    Whole Garlic Cloves --

2 tb Salt -- or to taste
_____Tie In Doubled
Cheesecloth___________
3    Whole Bay Leaves
1/4 ts Marjoram
10    Whole Peppercorns
1    Whole Allspice
1 tb Thyme -- leaves
2 tb Parsley -- flakes
Cook gently for several hours (as long as 5), until turkey is falling
off the bones.

Skim off fat, discard vegetables and turkey (the meat will be
thoroughly cooked out and dry - the broth will be infused with all
the meat's flavoring).  Strain the broth through a very fine mesh, or
several layers of cheesecloth. Correct the seasoning, and serve with
noodles or dumplings.

Optional:  The soup may be boiled down after straining, and clarified
to serve as a consomme.
