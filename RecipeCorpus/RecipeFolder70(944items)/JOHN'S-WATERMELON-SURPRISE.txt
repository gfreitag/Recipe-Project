Title: JOHN'S WATERMELON SURPRISE
Categories: Alcohol, Reinactment, Fruits, Beverages
Yield: 1 Batch
1/3 md Ripe watermelon
2 cn 12-oz. frozen lemonade con-
-centrate
1    Lemon
1/2 c  Sugar
2 cn Favorite distilled beverage
-using lemonade cans
Deseed and liquify watermelon without skin or rind, in blender.
Liquify a peeled and seeded lemon in blender. Add two cans of
lemonade concentrate following directions for lemonade, but
substituting alcohol for one can of water per can of concentrate.
John suggest unbonded whiskey, if available, but otherwise,
Everclear, vodka or light rum will do. Watch out for the Everclear
though. If you are in someone elses campsite you may never make it
back to yours. You may be found in the morning in the dewy grass with
the ants crawling in and out of your mouth...

Lest we digress...

Add sugar to taste starting with about 1/4 cup.  Cork in an old
whiskey or wine bottle, or even a mason jar. Keep in the cooler until
used. Serve to unsuspecting friends and be the hit of the party. Take
that for what it's worth.

NOTE:  A non-alcoholic version for young'uns, those of us with bad
livers, or designated drivers, is made by using the lemonade
concentrate as per directions without the booze. I have to say, the
flavor is refreshing and tasty.  Those drinking the leaded version
concur with us drinking the unleaded.
