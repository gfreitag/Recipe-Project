Title: JACK DUDLEY'S WOODPECKER PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
8 lb Suet
2 lb Peanut butter
1 oz To 8 oz bottle corn syrup
2 lb Rolled oats
(For all the birds at Pocomoonshine Lake, Maine)

Melt the suet in a canning kettle or other large container, pouring
the melted fat into another kettle as it cooks down. While the fat is
still hot, add the peanut butter, corn syrup, and oats, stirring
constantly until mixture is well blended.  Put the pudding into old
soup cans to cool and harden, and store in a cool place. To use, warm
the can until the pudding is soft enough to handle.  Drill a number
of 1 to 1-1/2 inch holes in a 4 inch diameter birch log (leave the
bark intact to provide toeholds for the birds)  Spread the pudding
into the holes, and hang the log outdoors where it is accessible to
the birds.
