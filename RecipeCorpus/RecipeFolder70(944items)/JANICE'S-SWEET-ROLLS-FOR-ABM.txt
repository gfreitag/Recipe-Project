Title: JANICE'S SWEET ROLLS FOR ABM
Categories: Abm, Rolls
Yield: 12 Rolls
4 c  All Purpose Flour
1 ts Salt
2 tb Shortening
8 tb Dry milk powder
1 md Egg--slightly beaten
1/2 c  Sugar
12 oz Water
2 1/2 ts Yeast--active dry *
Add to the breadmachine in order preferred by your machine. (In mine,
start with the flour and add dry ingredients first). Yeast should be
placed in the yeast dispenser. **note! If you use Fleishmans yeast,
increase the amount by 1 teaspoonful!

Run this on your dough cycle. After completion they can be finished
one of several ways. One is to take a pinch of dough about the size
of a small egg, pull, dip in melted butter, run through
sugar/cinnamon mixture and then tie them in a knot.

Another method is to roll out to about the size of a cookie sheet,
spread butter (slightly LESS than a stick) over surface, then top with
sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll and slice about 1/2 inch thickness. You
should get enough for about 3 9" round or sq. pans. I cover the
bottom of pans lightly with melted butter--just a small amt! Allow
room for them to double in size!

Place in a proofing oven (turn on oven set to 250 for 2 mins then
TURN OFF and place rolls in off oven). Let rise till very light and
double in bulk (will take about 1 1/2 hrs). Can cover with greased
waxed paper. (Do not use towels as they stick!!) Bake in preheated
oven at 375 degrees for about 20 mins. Remove from pan at once.

Can be frozen. Best when eaten warm! Recipe will work as a caramel
roll OR even just a plain sweet dinner-like roll. DO NOT use too much
butter as they will not rise enough!
