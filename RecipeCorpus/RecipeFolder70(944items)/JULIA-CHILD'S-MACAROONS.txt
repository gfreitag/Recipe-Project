Cut canned almond paste into 1/2" pieces.  Process on and off until
it's the texture of brown sugar.  add sugar and blend. add extract,
salt, and 1/4 C egg white. Process until no lumps remain. The dough
should not be stiff, but hold its mass on an inverted spoon.

For a crisp shell and soft interior, add a bit more egg white up to
the full 3/8 cup.

Beat in bowl with a wooden spoon until creamy and flexible.

Line cookie sheet with brown paper.  Drop small blobs on the paper,
leave room around them, they spread.
Smooth the tops. (Optional, at this point, you may decorate each
with a sliver of glaceed cherry)

Bake both cookie sheets at once in a 325 oven for 20-30 minutes,
depending on size.  Switch position of cookie sheets after about 12
or 15 minutes. They are done when lightly golden browned and crusty.

Let cool on paper.  When cool, turn paper up side down, dampen the
back of the paper to release the macaroons. Dry on a rack for another
30 minutes. Then store airtight or freeze.
