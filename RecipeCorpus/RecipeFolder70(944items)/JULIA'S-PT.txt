Title: JULIA'S PT
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Eggs; beaten
15 g  Butter
-OR- sunflower margarine
175 g  Leeks, cooked and chopped
1/2    Canned pimento
1 tb Summer herbs
-(finely chopped)
6    Black olives, stoned
-- to garnish
Salt to taste
This very unusual pt, made with leeks, herbs and pimento, is lovely
food. The distinctive flavours of the ingredients are not, however,
overpowering - they are well balanced by the eggs, which bind them
into a soft consistency.

Scramble the eggs in the butter or margarine until lightly set, then
leave to cool on a plate. Liquidize them, with the leeks, pimento and
herbs, to a pure. Season to taste. Pack into a small dish, and
garnish with granary toast.
