Title: JOHNNYCAKE WITH CHERVIL
Categories: Breads, Harned 1994, Herb/spice
Yield: 8 Servings
1 tb Corn oil
1 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1 pn Salt
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
2    Eggs; lightly beaten
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Buttermilk or soured milk
1/2 c  Fresh chervil, no stems*
-- loosely packed
*If chervil is unavailable, Italian parsley can be used instead.

Brush a square 8" baking pan with the oil.  Once oven is preheated,
heat greased pan until hot (but watch carefully). This helps ensure a
crispy bottom and sides. Muffin or cornstick pans may also be used.

Sift flour with sugar, baking powder and salt.  Stir in cornmeal. In
separate bowl, mix eggs with oil and buttermilk. Chop chervil leaves
to yield about 1/4 cup. Stir into milk-egg mixture. Make a well in
the dry ingredients and quickly pour in liquid.  Blend quickly with a
spatula just until mixed.  Do not overmix.

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake at 425 F. 20 minutes, or until
golden brown and crisp around edges. (Muffins or cornsticks may only
take 15 minutes). Cut into squares and serve at once, spreading with
butter if desired.

Save any leftovers and freeze for cornbread poultry stuffing.

Enright suggests serving this with stews, chowders, fried chicken or
ribs, and also says that this is good with a layered lamb stew.
