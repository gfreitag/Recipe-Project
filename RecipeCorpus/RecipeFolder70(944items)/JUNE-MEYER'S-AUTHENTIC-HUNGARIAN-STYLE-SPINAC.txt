I never knew what spinach was until I was a teenager. My parents
always planted Swiss chard, with the red veins, because the yield was
greater than spinach and the flavor was milder. I remember picking
the Swiss chard and washing those giant leaves for Hungarian creamed
Swiss chard or spinach. This is creamed spinach with a Transylvanian
touch. Regards, June Meyer.

Melt in a small saucepan over low heat 2 Tbs. butter with 1 finely
chopped fresh garlic clove. Saute garlic in butter a minute or so. Do
not let garlic burn or it will be bitter. Blend in 2 Tablespoons
flour to make a roux. Add 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper and heat
until mixture bubbles, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add
gradually 3/4 cup of cream or milk. Return to heat and stir until
mixture is smooth and thickened. Blend well drained spinach into
sauce and serve. Serves 4
