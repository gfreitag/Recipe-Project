Hungarian style green beans are unusual in that it combines, beans,
onions, fresh dill, vinegar and sugar to make a dish that is sweet,
sour, and dilly. This could only come from Hungary, where variety of
taste in a meal is commonplace. Use fresh or frozen cut green beans
for this dish. Not canned! It has always been received by
non-Hungarians as a new and delicious taste sensation. Regards, June
Meyer.

Cook beans in salted water till tender, not soft. Melt lard or
butter, add onions and sautÂŽ till limp, add chopped dill. Then add
flour making a roux. Add 1 cup of water, sugar and vinegar and stir
while the sauce gets thick. Add drained beans, and mix, if too thick
add a little more water. Serves 4 to 6.
