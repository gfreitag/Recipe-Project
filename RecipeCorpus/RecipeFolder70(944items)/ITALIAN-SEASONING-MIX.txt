2 tb Dry rosemary leaves
3/4 ts Fennel seed
1/4 c  Dry oregano leaves
1/4 c  Dry basil
1 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Dry thyme
Whirl rosemary and fennel seeds in a blender until powdered; stir in
and mix remaining ingredients; store in an airtight container for up
to 6 months. Makes about 3/4 cup. Sprinkle this seasoning on oiled or
buttered chicken   or turkey before cooking; sprinkle on any meaty
fish before grilling or broiling; add to a plain bean or vegetable
soup. It's the best combination I've found a lot cheper than the
