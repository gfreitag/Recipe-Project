Sylvia's comments: I converted this from a marinate-and-broil recipe
that required better meat. This worked great on cheap stew lamb; it
actually took away the strong lamb taste. I defatted the crockpot
juices, thickened with cornstarch, and used it on green beans. That
with the lamb and some yellow rice made a great dinner.
