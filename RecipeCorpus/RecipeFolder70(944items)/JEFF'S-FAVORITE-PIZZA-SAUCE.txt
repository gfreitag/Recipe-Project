Title: JEFF'S FAVORITE PIZZA SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Italian, Ethnic
Yield: 4 Servings
28 oz Canned Progresso Plum
Tomatoes w/Basil, drained
12 oz Tomato paste
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 ts Onion powder
1 tb Oregano, heaping
1 ts Garlic powder
2 tb Parmesan cheese
1/8 c  Olive oil
This sauce has a quality similar to restaurant flavor, but being
freshly made seems to take on a better flavor.

Puree the drained tomatoes well.  It is important to use Italian
Plum Tomatoes, not regular canned tomatoes. The flavor is
distinctively different.  If you cannot find Progresso Plum Tomatoes
with basil, add 1/2 ts. dried basil to the tomatoes.

Place the puree mixture in heavy saucepan.  Add remaining
ingredients except for the grated cheese. Simmer 1/2 hour, or longer
if necessary.

Add cheese last 10 minutes of cooking. The canned grated parmesan is
good in this recipe, as well as fresh.

Sauce can be frozen if needed.

Enjoy! - Jeff Duke
