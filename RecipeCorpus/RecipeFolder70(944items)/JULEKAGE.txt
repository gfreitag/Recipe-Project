Combine water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve
yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Blend melted
butter and egg into yeast mixture.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, remaining 3
tablespoons sugar, cardamom and salt into work bowl. Process until
mixed, about 10 seconds.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 20
seconds.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough milk through
feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that cleans the
sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl about 25
times. Trun off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining milk to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Knead in raisins and citron.
Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease
all sides. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm
place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Roll or pat into circle 8 inches in diameter.
Place in greased 9-inch round cake or pie pan. Brush with oil. Let
stand in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Beat egg yolk and cold water with fork. Brush
over bread.  Bake until evenly browned, 35 ~ 40 minutes.

Remove from pan immediately.  Cool on rack.
