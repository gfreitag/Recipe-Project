* SEE--June Meyer's Authentic Hungarian Smoked Butt in Brown Sugar
Hungarian style Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup takes advantage of the
very flavorful broth or cooking liquid remaining after cooking butt
made in the Austrian-Hungarian style. The butt is cooked in brown
sugar water. (See Smoked Butt Hungarian Style) I usually make the
butt and the Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup on the same day, but serve
the soup the next day. It is a hearty and filling soup, a favorite
with the children. Regards, June Meyer.

Into reserved smoked pork butt and brown sugar cooking liquid, add all
ingredients. Nice to add any left over smoked butt. Cover pot and
bring to a boil, lower heat and slowly cool until cabbage and
potatoes are soft. (About 1 1/2 hours). Adjust seasoning, add salt if
needed, add more brown sugar if needed.

The soup should have a sweet (from the brown sugar) and sour (from
the acid in the tomatoes). If you like, you can add a tablespoon of
good white vinegar or the juice of half a lemon to make it more sour.
Should be thick and full bodied.

Serve with a dollop of Sour Cream, crusty bread, and beer for a hearty
meal.
