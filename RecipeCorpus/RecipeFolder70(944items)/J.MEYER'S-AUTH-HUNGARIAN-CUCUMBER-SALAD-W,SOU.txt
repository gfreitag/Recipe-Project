Categories: Hungary, Canning, Condiment

1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Good vinegar (not red)

This cucumber salad is by far one of the most delicious and refreshing
salads you can eat. It has a wonderful cucumber flavor that is
enhanced by the garlic and sour cream. Originally this was a summer
salad to accompany roast meat or chicken dishes. Now that we have
cucumbers available all year round we can enjoy this dish all year.

I use a slaw slicer to slice the cucumber thinly enough to see
through! As a child I always enjoyed peeling and then grooving the
cucumbers with the tines of a fork before my mother would slice them.
I loved the refreshing cool cucumber spray that would mist my face.

Peel cukes. Drag fork tines down length of peeled cucumbers to create
long groves that will look very nice when you slice cucumbers very,
very thin. Put in mixing bowl.

Peel and chop clove of garlic. Add Salt and suger slices. Mix in sour
cream. Add vinegar (I like to use "Marukan seasoned gourmet Rice
Vinegar" orange label) and toss well, I use my hands, till cucumbers
slices and sour cream are all frothy and foamy.

Place in serving dish and sprinkle a little paprika on top for
decoration, and serve well chilled.

This will stay good in refridgerator for a few days. Serves 4. WALT
