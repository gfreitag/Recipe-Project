Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN RIVILCHAS FO
Categories: Hungary, Pasta, Dumpling
Yield: 25 Servings
2 c  Sifted flour
2    Whole eggs
1/2 ts Salt
How I loved to eat Hungarian Beef Soup with Rivilchas. A tiny chewy
dumpling for Hungarian soups, they were made fresh and cooked in the
soup in the big stock pot after the meat and whole vegetables were
removed to a separate serving platter. They cook up chewy, better
than any noodle. My Mother would guickly mix the stiff dough and
grate it into irregular gratings of dough. Regards, June Meyer.

Mix the flour, eggs and salt together. Knead to make a stiff dough.
You may add a little water if the dough is too stiff. Grate on the
medium side of a grater. Rivilchas should be the size of dried peas.

Drain and serve in hot Beef Soup, hot Chicken Soup or Tomato Soup.

Note: If you have a large pot of boiling soup, you can cook these
Rivilchas in the soup.

Serve instead of potato, noodles, dumplings or rice. WALT
