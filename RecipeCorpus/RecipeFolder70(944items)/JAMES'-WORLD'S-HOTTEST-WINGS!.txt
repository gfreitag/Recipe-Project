the wings and broil them until cooked. Usually approx 15 mins (+/- 5
mins). Take the marinade, put it on the stove, add 1/4 cup sugar and
heat to a boil. reduce until thick. Pour over wings and re-broil for
about 5 more minutes, serve with soda water for maximum heat effect
but keep plenty of ice water handy.
