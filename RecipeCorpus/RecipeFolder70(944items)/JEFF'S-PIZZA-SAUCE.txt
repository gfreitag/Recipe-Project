Title: JEFF'S PIZZA SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Italian, Pizza
Yield: 4 Servings
56 oz (2-28 oz cans) Italian Plum
Tomatoes, drained
6 oz Tomato paste (small can)
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Corn syrup
2 tb Brown sugar
2 1/2 tb Oregano
1 tb Tarragon
1 ts Salt
1 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Basil
1/2 ts Onion powder
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
If you don't like small bits of tomato in the sauce, puree the whole
tomatoes in the blender first. Otherwise, chop them as the mixture
cooks.

Mix all ingredients, except oregano, in large saucepan. Simmer for 30
minutes, then add oregano. Cook additional 15 minutes.

Sauce is best if cooked then chilled, overnight, in the refrigerator.

To Use:  Prepare basic pizza dough.  Spoon sauce onto crust out to
rims, cover with thick layer of mozzarella cheese. Top with meat and
vegetable toppings, then cover again with mozzarella and parmesan (or
romano) cheeses. All cheeses are best if freshly grated.
