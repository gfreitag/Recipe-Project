and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium an cook for about 35
minutes.

While the mixture cooks, thinly slice the andouille sausage and roast
in 350F oven for about 15 minutes (this will render out a lot of the
grease). Add andouille to the pot, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook
for about 30 minutes.  Add shrimp and cook for about 5 minutes.
Season with salt to taste.  Serve over rice.
