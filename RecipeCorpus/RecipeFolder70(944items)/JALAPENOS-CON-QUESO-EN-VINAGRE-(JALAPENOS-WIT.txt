Title: JALAPENOS CON QUESO EN VINAGRE (JALAPENOS WIT
Categories: Preserves, Appetizers, Mexican, Peppers
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Jalapeno Peppers
2 c  Vinegar
1 c  Vegetable oil
3    Carrots in slices
2 md Onions in slices
1 tb Spices: Bay leaf, oregano
- Thyme, sweet marjoram
Cheese*
*Cheese: the cheese need to be white, fresh and needs to resist the
warm temperature without melting.

Peel the peppers like poblanos: roast in the flame of a stove and
then put in a plastic bag for 20 min at least, then hold under water
while peeling them. (This peeling is optional.)

Cut one side of peppers and take out the seeds (keep one teaspoon of
this seeds).  Fill with a little amount of cheese and use a toothpick
to close the peppers. In the vegetable oil fry the onion slices,
carrot slices and the peppers just long enough to soften them. Add
vinegar and spices and a teaspoon of seeds and let boil only 3 or 4
min. Let cool and keep in glass jars.  You can use immediatly.  The
length of time you can keep these depends on the kind of cheese you
use.

Variations: You can add cloves of garlic and cauliflower, or add the
spices you like, if you add more ingredients you need also to add
more vinegar and oil, the peppers and vegetables need to be covered
with oil and vinegar. This recipe is a basic recipe, and you can make
changes as you like.
