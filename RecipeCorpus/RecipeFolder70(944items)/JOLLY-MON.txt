Title: JOLLY MON
Categories: Boat, Drinks, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
1 oz Dark rum
1 oz Coconut cream
Shredded coconut meat -- as
Garnish
Everyone has had it and it and probably has a gazillion names but it
is usually rum and coconut. This is my book and my variant so I'm
calling it a JOLLY MON. Mix it up and serve it over crushed ice.
Garnish with shredded coconut. (Don't want to water it down Mix up a
batch ahead of time mixing equal portion of all three ingredients and
store it a fridge. Serve cold.)
