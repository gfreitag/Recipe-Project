~------------- ~-- Put the sausage in the freezer until ready to
prepare. Remove sausage from freezer and separate under running
water. Once separated take a sharp knife and just cut through the
casing length wise. The casing will now peal away and can be
discarded. It's so much better if you do this. Cut the frozen sausage
into bite sized pieces. Put the sausage into a large cast iron frying
pan and cook over medium heat until brown. Reduce heat to low. Remove
the seeds from the peppers and discard. Cut the peppers into bite
sized pieces. Place the cut up peppers into a microwave proof
container and microwave approximately 20 minutes on High or until
they reach your desired doneness. Prepare the Minute Rice per
directions. Slice 1/2 pound of fresh mushrooms and microwave on High
for 2-1/2 minutes. Add the cooked peppers and mushrooms to the
sausage. Add the rice to the whole mixture and mix. This is a very
nice looking dish and there are never leftovers at my house. From:
