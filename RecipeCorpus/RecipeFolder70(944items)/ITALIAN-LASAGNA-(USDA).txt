Title: ITALIAN LASAGNA (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
2 1/4 lb Lean ground beef
1/3 c  Instant minced onion
3/4 ts Garlic powder
4 ts Salt
3/8 ts Red pepper -- crushed
1 tb Oregano
3 tb Parsley flakes
18 oz Tomato paste -- 3 (6-oz)
Cans
24 oz Tomato sauce -- 3 (8-oz)
Cans
2 1/4 c  Hot water
3 lg Eggs -- beaten
3 lb Ricotta cheese
1 lb Lasagna noodles -- cooked,
(18 noodles)
12 oz Mozzarella cheese --
Shredded
3/4 c  Parmesan cheese
Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

Crumble beef; cook until lightly browned.  Stir in onion. Cook until
onion is tender.  Drain off fat. Stir in seasonings, tomato paste,
tomato sauce, and water. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
In another bowl, blend eggs with ricotta cheese.

In each pan, spread a layer of meat mixture (about 3/4 cup). Add a
layer each of noodles (2 1/4), meat mixture (about 3/4 cup), ricotta
cheese mixture (about 3/4 cup), mozzarella cheese (1/3 cup), and
parmesan cheese (1 1/2 tablespoons).  Repeat layers until all
ingredients are used. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Bake 30
minutes or until sauce bubbles at edges.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
for 10-12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN LASAGNA:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until
sauce bubbles at edges and center is hot.
