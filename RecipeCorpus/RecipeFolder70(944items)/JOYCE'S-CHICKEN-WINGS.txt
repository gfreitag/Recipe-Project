Title: JOYCE'S CHICKEN WINGS
Categories: Improv, Kohl, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
Chicken Wings
Flour
Salt & Pepper
Crisco shortening
Cut each wing into three sections (I throw away the tiny meatless
part). Skin the "drumsticks" and cut away excess skin and
fat/feathery edges of the "double-bone" sections. Salt and pepper
both sides of each piece.

Put some flour into a bowl (with a lid that fits it). Add salt and
pepper. Dump all the chicken pieces into the flour, put the lid on
tightly, then shake to thoroughly cover each piece of chicken.

You can cook right away, but I usually refrigerate the chicken for a
couple of hours to allow the flour to get sticky. Then pull apart the
pieces, add flour and shake again while my Crisco is getting hot.

Deep fry the pieces in Crisco shortening...add enough Crisco to a
skillet to be about 1/2" deep.

Serve while hot with side dishes of hot sauce...my favorite recipe is
my own...contained in: IT NEVER TURNS OUT THE SAME WAY COOKBOOK A
