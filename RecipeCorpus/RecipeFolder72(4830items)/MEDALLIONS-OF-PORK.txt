* BOUQUET GARNI - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. ** Beurre Manie is
used to thicken sauces.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a
small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth
paste. Roll the paste into a ball. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Butter a large flameproof baking dish and set aside. Start by making
the sauce. In a heavy saucepan melt the clarified butter.  Add the
minced vegetables and cook them over low heat for 5 to 8 minutes or
until they are very soft but not browned. Add the flour and stir it
until it is well blended with the vegetables.  Raise the heat a
little and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes a
hazelnut brown. Do not burn or scorch the bottom of the saucepan.  As
soon as the flour mixture has turned nutty brown, add the hot brown
stock all at once and stir until the mixture is smooth and lightly
thickened. Add the Bouquet Garni, tomato paste, salt and pepper. Do
not oversalt as the sauce will become saltier as it reduces.
Partially cover the pan and simmer for 1 hour, stirring it from time
to time. Strain the sauce and reserve. While the sauce is cooking,
make the mustard butter. In a small bowl place the softened butter.
Add the Dijon and dry mustard and blend the mixture well with a
wooden spoon. Add the lemon juice and chill. THE PORK - In a large
skillet melt the 2 T of butter and oil. Season the pork medallions
with salt and white pepper. When the butter and oil are very hot, add
the pork medallions, a few at a time, and brown them on both sides.
As the medallions brown, remove them from the pan and set them aside.
Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and cook them over low heat
until they are soft but not browned. Add the meat glaze and the wine.
Bring it to a boil and scrape the bottom of the pan well. Reduce the
wine to 2 T. Add the strained sauce and bring it to a boil. Place the
pork medallions in the buttered baking dish and pour the sauce over
them. Cover the dish with foil and set it in the oven. Braise the
pork for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven to
the top of the stove. With a slotted spoon remove the pork to a
serving platter. Raise the heat and reduce the sauce slightly,
skimming off the fat. If it does not coat the spoon heavily, beat in
the Beurre Manie, bit by bit, until the sauce reaches the right
consistency. Add the minced capers and parsley and heat through.
Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the Mustard Butter little
by little until it is well incorporated into the sauce. Correct the
seasoning, adding a good dash of black pepper. Spoon the sauce over
the medallions and serve garnished with tiny glazed turnip and potato
balls.
