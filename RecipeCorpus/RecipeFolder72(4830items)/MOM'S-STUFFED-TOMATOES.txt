Title: MOM'S STUFFED TOMATOES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Tomatoes; large
2    Bread slices;whole wheat
8    Anchovies
1/2 ts Oil from anchovies
1/3 c  Parmesan cheese; reserve 2
1 ds Pepper
Preheat oven to 375F. Choose large, attractive tomatoes. Scoop out
tomato centres carefully, leaving bottoms intact. Set aside inside of
tomatoes. Toast bread and cut into 1/2" cubes. Pour oil from
anchovies on bread cubes. Mash anchovies or mince into fine pieces.
Mix anchovies, bread cubes and inside of tomatoes. Add parmesan
cheese to mixture (this will prevent it from getting too wet inside
tomatoes). Spoon mixture into hollowed out tomatoes. Sprinkle 2 tbsp
of reserved parmesan on top of tomatoes. Put in 8" square cake pan.
Carefully pour in 1/2 inch water around tomatoes. Bake 30 minutes in
a preheated 375F oven. Serves: 4 served this to my future husband
when we were both living in a o-op apt downtown. Another neighbour
had been bringing him brownies, gave him my stuffed tomatoes.
Fortunately, my husband wasn't (and) sn't a dessert lover, he
preferred my tomatoes! e flavour of anchovies is not evident in this
recipe and ven 'anchovy haters' will enjoy it. Source: Mom
