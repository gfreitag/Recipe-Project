Title: MONDEL BREAD
Categories: Breads, Cakes, Desserts=7f
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Oil
1 1/2 c  Walnuts or pecans
1/2 ts Baking powder
2 c  Flour
Mix sugar and eggs in Mix Master.  Add the oil. Remove from the mixer
and proced by hand.  Add [finely chopped] nuts into the mixture and
add the other ingredients into the mixture with a wooden spoon.
Mixture must not be too soft not too stiff so you can roll it into a
salami shape.

Place rolls on a cookie sheet in a 350 [f] oven until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and cut into diagonal slices. Return to oven for
about 15-20 minutes.

I find that I have to chill it over night and add flour to each roll
so it will stand up as a roll and not flatten out-sometimes as much
as a cup or even more depending on the size of the eggs. Submitted By
