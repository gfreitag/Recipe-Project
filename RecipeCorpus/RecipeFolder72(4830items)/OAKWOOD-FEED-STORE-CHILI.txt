Winner of the 1985 NY State Chili Cook-Off Fry bacon in a heavy pot
till crisp and the fat is rendered. Remove and reserve bacon. Pour
off most of the bacon fat into a heavy cast iron skillet, leaving s
small amount in the pot.  Brown the meat and garlic in the skillet.
Saute onions in the fat remaining in the pot until soft. Add the
meat, bacon, ground chilies, dried spices, the sauces, green chilies,
Jalapenos, stock and tomatoes. Simmer for two hours.
Allow the chili to sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours to give the
spices a chance to intensify.
For garnishes, serve fresh chopped Jalapenos, chopped raw onions,
shredded Monterey or sharp Cheddar cheese, and saltines. Serves 8
generously.
