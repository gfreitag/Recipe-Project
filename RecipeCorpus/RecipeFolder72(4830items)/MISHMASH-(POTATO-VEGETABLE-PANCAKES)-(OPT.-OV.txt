The technique of making potato cakes is a great one! I often steam
potatoes along with carrots and turnips or rutabagas or winter
squash, and then mash them all together with a little heated rice
milk. We call it "mishmash." My mother made us this dish (with ground
b**f) when we were convalescing, because it was easy to eat. It's
great with ketchup. Leftovers make wonderful cakes, mixed with matzo
meal or bread crumbs, and even egg white if you need a binder. It's
also easy to reheat in the microwave.
