In Spite of it's name, Mock Goose is a Vegetarian dish, with the added
wartime virtue that most of the ingredients could be grown.

Method: Pre-heat oven to gas mark 5, 375F, 190C. Toss the potatoes,
apples, onions, cheese and sage together, seasoning with salt and
pepper until they are well mixed. Turn the mixture into a large
buttered ovenproof dish and cover with a lid of buttered foil or
greaseproof paper. Bake for about 30 minutes until the fruit and
vegetables are really tender. Meanwhile mix together the topping
ingredients (Stuffing Mix and Grated Cheese). At the end of the
cooking time uncover the dish, sprinkle the topping liberally over
the dish and return to the oven, raising the temperature to gas mark
9, 475F, 240C for 10 more minutes or until just nicely browned. Serve
with a mixed green salad and plenty of crusty, wholemeal bread.
