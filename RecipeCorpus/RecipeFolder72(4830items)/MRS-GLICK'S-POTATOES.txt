Title: MRS GLICK'S POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles, Ew
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Large Yukon Gold or russet
-potatoes (about 6),
-scrubbed but not peeled
6 lg Cloves garlic, unpeeled
1 1/2 c  Low-fat cottage cheese
1/2 c  Reduced-fat sour cream
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 bn Scallions, trimmed & sliced
1/2 c  Grated extra-sharp Cheddar
1/4 ts Paprika
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly coat a 2 quart baking dish with
nonstick cooking spray or oil.  Place potatoes and garlic in a large
saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a simmer over medium
heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the potatoes are barely
tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and let sit until cool enough to
handle, about 20 minutes.  Peel the potatoes and grate them into a
large bowl; set aside. Squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins
into a food processor. Add cottage cheese and process until
completely smooth. Add sour cream, salt and pepper and process
briefly to combine. Add the cottage cheese mixture and scallions to
the grated potatoes and mix well. Turn into the prepared baking dish
and sprinkle with grated Cheddar and paprika. (The recipe can be
prepared ahead to this point and stored, covered, in the refrigerator
for up to 2 days.) Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown.
