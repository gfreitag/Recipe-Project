Title: OATCAKES (BAKESTONE RECIPES)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
4 oz Medium oatmeal*
1/2 ts Salt
1 pn Bicarbonate of soda
2 tb Melted bacon fat**
2 fl Hot water***
*Grinding down regular rolled oats slightly in a blender or grinder
will be a help.  **Or beef dripping. ***Approximately. -- Mix the
oatmeal, salt and soda in a bowl.  Make a well in the center.  Pour
in the melted fat and add enough water to make a stiff dough which
can be squeezed into a ball. Sprinkle the board and your hands with
oatmeal and knead the mixture until there are no cracks in it.
Flatten the ball and roll it out into a round just under 1/4 inch
thick. Invert a plate on top and trim off the ragged edges -- these
can be added to the next batch of dough to be rolled. Cut the round
into quarters, lift them onto a warmed and greased bakestone and cook
over moderate heat for 20 minutes or until the triangles curl at the
corners.  Turn and cook the other side for 5 minutes, or finish under
a moderate grill.  Store the oatcakes in an airtight tin, and toast
under a moderate grill, or in the oven, before serving.  -- These are
served with honey, marmalade or jam for breakfast, or with crowdie (a
slightly sweet Highland Scots cottage cheese) for tea. They are
especially good with fried herring or smoked haddock.  Not to mention
any kind of caviar you can get your hands on.
