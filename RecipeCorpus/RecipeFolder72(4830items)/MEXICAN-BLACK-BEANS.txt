Title: MEXICAN BLACK BEANS
Categories: Beans/peas, Mexico, Crockpot
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Black beans
1    Water to cover
1/4    Cup, chopped fine Onion
1 ts Cooking oil
1 ts Cooking oil
1/2    Chopped fine Onion
1/4    Cup, chopped Bell pepper
3    Cloves, diced Garlic
1    Salt to taste
Wash the beans.  Put A-D in a large pot and cook until tender. Then
saute E-H in a small pan, and add to the beans. Salt to taste and
cook about an hour more.

This is a highly modified recipe out of a Mexican cookbook. The author
suggested a crock pot for about 10 hours. It didn't get the beans
tender so I put it in a large pot and simmered the beans about an
hour. The author also said not to soak the beans over night, because
that would give the beans a strong flavor. I was doubtful, but that
advice seems to be right.

I also made some nachos with it.  I used about half a cup of cooked
beans after the first step (A-D).  I mashed them with a spoon, and
fried in margarine in a small skillet with a few diced onions. I
sauteed some ground turkey with taco seasoning, and then layered bean
paste, turkey, and cheddar cheese on chips. Very good. I am thinking
of making up a batch of beans just to make black bean paste.
