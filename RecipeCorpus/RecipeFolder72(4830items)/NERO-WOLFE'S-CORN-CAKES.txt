Title: NERO WOLFE'S CORN CAKES
Categories: Breads, Side dish
Yield: 18 Servings
2 c  Yellow corn meal
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Powdered sage
1 1/2 ts Salt
4 tb Butter
1/4 c  Minced celery
2 lg Eggs
3 c  Milk
Combine the corn meal, flour, baking powder, sage and salt in a bowl.
In a small skillet melt the butter and saute the celery until soft.
Beat the eggs and add to the corn meal with the celery and butter.
Mix well. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly until the
batter is the thickness of heavy cream. Heat the griddle, grease it,
and pour out the batter by spoonfuls to make cakes about two inches
in diameter. Turn once so they are nicely browned on both sides. Add
more milk to the batter if it begins to thicken. Serve as a side dish
with plenty of butter.
