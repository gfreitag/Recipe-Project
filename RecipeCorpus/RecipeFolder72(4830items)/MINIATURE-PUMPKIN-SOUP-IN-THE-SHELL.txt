Categories: New, Text, Import
8    mini pumpkins (each about
the
size of a large tomato)
Yield: 1 Servings
:
:
1/2 c  thinly sliced onion

1/2 TB minced fresh sage

:
3 c  chicken stock
1/4 c  freshly grated Parmesan
Chopped fresh parsley for

Cut the top 1/4 off 4 pumpkins, reserving the lids and discard the
seeds. Cut the remaining pumpkins in half and discard the seeds.

Bake the pumpkins (including the reserved lids), cut side down, on
lightly oiled baking sheets in a preheated 350 degree oven for 40
minutes or until they are tender. (Remove the lids after about 20
minutes.) When they are cool enough to handle, scrape all the pulp
out of the halved pumpkins. Scrape most of the pulp out of the
remaining pumpkins, leaving just enough in each so that it retains
its shape.

In a skillet cook the onion in the butter over low heat, stirring,
until it is softened. Add the sage and cook for 2 minutes. Add the
pumpkin pulp and chicken stock and simmer for 20 minutes.

Puree the mixture in batches in a blender and transfer it to a
saucepan. Stir in salt and pepper to taste and water to thin the soup
if necessary. Ladle about 1/2 cup of soup into each of 4 heated soup
bowls and put one of the hollowed-out reheated  pumpkin shells on
top. Fill each pumpkin shell with the soup and garnish with a
sprinkling of the Parmesan and some of the parsley. Top with the
reserved lids.

Yield: 4 servings
