Title: MIKE'S BLEU CHEESE DRESSING
Categories: Dressings
Yield: 34 Servings
3/4 c  Sour cream (I use fat free)
1/2 ts Dry Coleman's mustard
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 1/3 c  Mayonnaise, I use Best Foods
-Real Mayo, with all the fat
4 oz Bleu cheese, crumbled
In a medium bowl, mix all ingredients.  Best to let the flavors blend
overnight in the refer.  But usuable a couple hours later, if need be.

Hope you enjoy, Mike.
