Title: MONKEY ON A STICK (MARINATED BEEF STRIPS)
Categories: Beef, To/from mc-
Yield: 10 Servings
2 lb Lean beef, chopped small
1 c  Soy sauce, more as needed
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2    Onion, chopped small
2 tb Dark brown sugar
Slice beef thinly cross-grain (it will slice more easily if partially
frozen). Vary marinade ingredients to taste.

Place beef strips in a shallow glass container or a ziploc bag along
with marinade ingredients. Marinate overnight to 2 days, stirring
occasionally or turning bag to mix.

Thread beef on to wooden skewers and cook over very hot charcoal.

Serve while still hot with rice and oriental vegetables, or just as
an hors d'ourve. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #
