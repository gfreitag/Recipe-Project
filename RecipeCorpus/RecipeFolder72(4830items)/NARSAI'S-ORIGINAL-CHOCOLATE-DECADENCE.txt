Title: NARSAI'S ORIGINAL CHOCOLATE DECADENCE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 12 Servings
1 lb High quality bittersweet
Or semisweet chocolate
1/4 lb (plus 2 tb) unsalted butter
4    Whole eggs
1 tb Sugar
1 tb All-purpose flour
1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
Shaved bittersweet chocolate
1    Package (10-12 oz.) frozen
Raspberries, thawed
Flour and butter an 8-inch round cake pan.  Cut a round of waxed
paper to fit the bottom, butter it, and place in the pan. Preheat the
oven to 425F. In a small saucepan over very low heat or in a
microwave oven, melt the chocolate with the butter. Set aside. In the
top of a double boiler over very hot water, whisk the eggs with the
sugar. Beat over hot water until the sugar dissolves and the mixture
is just lukewarm. Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat
and beat the eggs until they quadruple in volume and become quite
thick. Fold the flour into the eggs. Stir 1/4 of the egg mixture into
the chocolate. Then, fold the chocolate back into the rest of the egg
mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 15
minutes; the cake will be liquid in the center. Cover and freeze the
cake in the pan overnight. To unmold the cake, carefully dip the
bottom of the pan in hot water and invert onto a cake plate. Remove
the pan and gently peel off the waxed paper.  Decorate the cake with
the whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Refrigerate until serving.
Puree the raspberries and their juice in a blender or food processor.
Pass the puree through a fine sieve and serve a tablespoon of the
sauce with each portion.
