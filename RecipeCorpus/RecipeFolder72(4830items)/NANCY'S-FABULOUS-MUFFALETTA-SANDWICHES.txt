Title: NANCY'S FABULOUS MUFFALETTA SANDWICHES
Categories: Italian
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lg Garlic cloves, crushed
1 c  Chopped green olives stuffed
-with pimientos
1 c  Pitted and chopped
-"black-ripe" olives or
-Calamatas
1/2 c  Roasted sweet red peppers,
-chopped
1 c  Olive oil
3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb White wine vinegar
1/3 lb Salami
1/2 lb Provolone Cheese
1/2 lb Mild Cheese
1/3 lb Mortadella Cheese
1/3 lb Prosciutto
The roasted red peppers are Italian-style, available at many Italian
delis. When you're ready for a sandwich the next day, assemble the
following:

One loaf fresh Italian bread (one big round for a monster, individual
hero (grinder, sub,...) loaves will do fine for smaller sandwiches)

Cut  the loaf (loaves) in half,  and scoop out a little of the inside
to make some room.   Drizzle some of the olive oil and juice from the
olive salad on each side of the open loaf -- use plenty. On the
bottom, place some  salami,  olive  salad, provolone, mild cheese,
and mortadella. Top with the other half loaf. Slice into wedges (or
eat the individual loaves).
