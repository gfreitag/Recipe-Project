Title: NONA'S BAKLAVA
Categories: Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 20 Servings
1 c  Butter (salted)
1 c  Honey
1/2 c  Sweet butter, melted
1 ea Box fillo dough
1 lb Walnuts, chopped
1 lb Almonds, chopped
1 ts Nutmeg
Heat regular (salted) butter with honey until mixture bubbles. Set
aside about 1/8 of it.  In a bowl, combine nuts and nutmeg. Pour
remaining 7/8 of honey syrup over nut mix to moisten. Lay fillo dough
on cutting board lengthwise.  Brush one layer at a time with melted
sweet butter (unsalted) until you have 3 layers. Line up a 1/4-inch
wide strip of nut mix along edge of dough about 1/4-inch thick. Pick
up that edge and roll dough into a cylinder with nut mix in the
center. Cut each cylinder into 8 pieces and place in 9 x 13-inch
baking dish. Repeat until all nut mix and fillo dough are used. Bake
at 350 degrees until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes. Warm
leftover syrup and spoon on top. Let cool before serving. If you
cannot locate fillo dough, use our pie crust recipe, roll dough very
thin, and use only one layer of dough instead of three. Makes 1 batch.
