In a heavy skillet, dry roast the chiles, cumin, coriander, cinnamon,
cloves and cardamom until fragrant. Place in a coffee or spice
grinder and grind to a fine powder. Place in a small bowl and add
enough water to make a paste. Set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a pan and saute the onion, ginger, garlic and
turmeric till crisp-tender. Add the coconut milk and Poblano chiles
and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Add the
tomatoes and shrimps and simmer until shrimps are just cooked,
approximately 3 minutes. Season if desired with salt and drops of
lemon juice. Serve immediately with a garnish of cilantro leaves and
steamed rice.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
