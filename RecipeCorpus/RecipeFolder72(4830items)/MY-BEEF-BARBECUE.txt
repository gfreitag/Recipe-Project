Title: MY BEEF BARBECUE
Categories: Beef
Yield: 20 Servings
4 lb Beef stew meat -- small
Cubes
30 oz Tomatoes -- chopped
2    Onions -- chopped
1 qt Water
1/2 ts Chili powder
1 ts Salt -- to taste
1 ts Black pepper -- fresh
Ground
1 c  Catsup
1/2 c  Cider vinegar
1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
4    Garlic cloves -- minced
1/8 ts Hot pepper sauce
* DO NOT attempt this recipe in a crockpot, since no evaporation takes
place there.

Combine all ingredients in a VERY large heavy pot. Simmer uncovered
over low heat until beef falls to shreds, stirring occasionally. This
will take 5 to 6 hours; watch carefully the last hour to make sure
that it is not sticking. Mixture should be very thick. The mixture
fills a large pot before cooking but becomes a small amount by the
time it is cooked.

While cooking I sometimes add chopped green peppers, celery, bay
leaf, or carrots.

Serve on hamburger buns with mustard.
