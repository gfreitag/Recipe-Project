BROWNIE LAYER: Cream soft butter with sugar. Add eggs one at a time

flour; being careful not to overmix.

In microwave, melt chocolate 2-3 minutes in small glass measuring cup,
stirring after 1 1/2 minutes. Stir chocolate into batter evenly. Pour
batter into greased 8-inch square casserole. Spread evenly. Cook 7-8
minutes on high, rotating after 3 minutes. Allow to cool.

MINT LAYER: Cream butter and sugar. Add milk and blend until creamy.
Add flavoring and enough color to be light green. Carefully spread
over cooled brownies, evenly. Allow mint layer to "firm up" before
adding chocolate layer. CHOCOLATE LAYER: Melt in glass measure cup
for 2-3 minutes. Stir after 1 minute. Allow to cool and spread over
firm mint layer. Spread carefully so mint and brownie layers are not
disturbed. allow to stand several hours. Cut into squares to serve.

I usually bake a 9 X 13 pan of brownies from a mix! Double the mint
and chocolate icing recipes. This is a very popular brownie!
