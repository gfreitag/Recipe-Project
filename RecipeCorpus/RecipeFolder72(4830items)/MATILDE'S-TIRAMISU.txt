Title: MATILDE'S TIRAMISU
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
14 oz Ladyfingers
14 oz Marscapone cheese
-(or ricotta)
4    Eggs separated
4 oz Sugar
2 c  Espresso or strong coffee
Cocoa and powdered sugar
Beat egg whites until stiff white peaks.  In a separate bowl, beat egg
yolks and sugar until creamy and lemon colored. Add marscapone cheese
to egg yolk mixture, beat until smooth. Then fold in the egg whites.

Soak the ladyfingers in the coffee, and make a layer of half of them.
(I found quickly dipping each ladyfinger in the coffee worked well)
Cover layer of ladyfingers with half the cheese. Repeat layer of
ladyfingers and layer of cheese.

Mix together about 2 tsp of cocoa with 2 tsp powdered sugar, and sift
over the top.  Cover and refrigerate.
