Title: NANCY SILVERTON'S OVERNIGHT YEAST BATTER
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Fresh or dried yeast
1/4 c  Tap water,
-in a 1 cup measure
1/4 ts Sugar
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Water,
-droplets more if needed
Crumble or sprinkle the yeast over the water in the measure, whisk in
the sugar, and let rise for several minutes until it begins to foam.
Whisk it again, then scrape into a 2 quart glass or plastic
container. Whisk in the cup of flour, then the water, to make a
mixture the consistency of pancake batter. Set uncovered at room
temperature for several hours, until it foams and produces bit heavy
bubbles. Stir it up, and leave overnight. May be used in place of the
Silverton starter in any of her recipes.

AHEAD OF TIME NOTE: If not to be used the next day, cover and
refrigerate. The batter will gradually turn into a sourdough; feed it
and treat it in the same way as the finished Silverton starter. From:
