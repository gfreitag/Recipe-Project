Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped
mushrooms and onions. Cook until juices evaporate, stirring
occasionally. Stir in lemon juice, flour and thyme. Stir for 2
minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool.

Spread 1/3 of mushroom mixture evenly over 1 pastry sheet. Starting
from one short side, roll up jelly roll fashion to the center of the
sheet only. Starting at second short side, roll to center. Press two
sides together and transfer to baking sheet.

Repeat with two remaining pastry sheets and mushrooms. Cover and chill
until firm, and least 2 hours or overnight. (Can be prepared up until
this point and frozen for 1 week.) Thaw slightly before baking.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Using a serrated knife, slice pastry
into 1/4-inch thick slices. Slices should look like figure eights.
Arrange cut side down on ungreased baking sheets, spacing 1 inch
apart. Brush with glaze.

Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.
