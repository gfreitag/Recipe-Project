2 c  Quinoa
In a 3-qt. pot, bring chickpeas, kombu and soaking water to a boil.
Cover, reduce heat to medium and boil for 2 hours. Add water as
necessary so that water just covers the chickpeas. Remove 2 c. liquid
from the pot and set aside in a 2-qt. pot.  Place onions, carrots and
turnips on top of the chickpeas and add enough water or stock to just
cover vegetables. Add salt, garlic, bay, cumin, pepper and olive oil.
Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce to light boil and cook for 40
minutes. Add Brussels sprouts and cook an additional 10 minutes.
Adjust seasoning. While vegetables and chickpeas continue to cook,
add 2 c. water and salt to the stock in the 2-qt. pot and bring to a
boil. Heat a thin pan, add oil and, while stirring continuously,
toast quinoa for 10 minutes. Add to boiling stock, cover and simmer
15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.
Gently mix from top to bottom with a damp wooden spoon. Cover pot and
allow to rest for another 5 to 10 minutes. Serve by placing a large
mound of quinoa on each individual plate. Flatten the mound in the
center and fill with vegetables and chickpeas. Pour 1/2 c. of hot
stock over all and serve hot.
