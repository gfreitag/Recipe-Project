1/2 c  Chopped onion
6 tb Butter
1 ts Salt

3 c  Cubed cooked chicken
1/2 c  Cooked peas

Dice)
1/4 c  Chopped pimientos
Prepare pastry; rollout 1/4 inch thick.  Cut to fit the tops of six
individual casseroles.  Bake on ungreased baking sheet at 450 degrees
fro 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, cook onion in butter until tender
but not brown. Blend in flour and salt. Cook, stirring constantly
until flour is cooked. Add broth all at one time. Cook and stir until
thick and bubbly; add remaining ingredients. Heat till bubbling. Pour
into 6 heated individual casseroles. Place pastry on hot filling just
before serving. Serves 6. Note: If you want to be incredibly daring
(for the 1950's), add 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms and a tablespoon of
sherry!
