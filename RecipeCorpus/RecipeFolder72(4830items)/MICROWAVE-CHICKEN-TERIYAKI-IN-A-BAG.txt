Title: MICROWAVE CHICKEN TERIYAKI IN A BAG
Categories: Microwave, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Whole chicken
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/3 c  Honey
1/3 c  Dry sherry
1 tb Cornstarch
Microwave cooking bag
1. Into the cooking bag, place soy sauce, honey and sherry. Add whole
chicken to bag and tie securely. Place the bag into a 2-quart oblong
glass baking dish. Refrigerate for 2 hours, turn the bag 2-3 times to
allow marinade to reach all surfaces of the chicken. 2. When ready to
microwave, cut a slit in the bag near the closure. If you are using a
temperature probe, insert through the slit into the thickest part of
the thigh. Avoid touching the bone. 3. Microwave at medium high until
temperature reaches 190 degrees, or about 20 minutes. Temperature
varies so check after about 17 minutes. Remove chicken from
microwave. 4. Prepare the sauce. Into a 1-quart glass measuring cup
stir together 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Cut
off one corner of the cooking bag and drain the juices into the
measuring cup with the cornstarch and water. Microwave on high power
for 2 minutes, stirring after one minute. Sauce should be thick and
clear. 5. Chicken should stand in bag for 10 minutes; remove bag
carefully, and place chicken on serving platter. Pour sauce over
chicken and serve immediately.
