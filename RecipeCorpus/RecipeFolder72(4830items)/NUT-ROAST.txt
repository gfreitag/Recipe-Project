Title: NUT ROAST
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Nuts
Yield: 4 Servings
4 oz Hazel nuts
3 oz Breadcrumbs
1    Carrot; grated
1    Onion; grated
1    Apple; grated
1 tb Tomato puree
1 ts Marmite
1 ts Olive oil
Garlic to taste
Put vegetables in water, boil a few minutes, reserve water. Mix all,
roll into shape, cover with breadcrumbs, bake 40 minutes at Mark 6
Serve with gravy made with tomato puree garlic and reserved water.
OH- forgot essential detail - must roast the hazel nuts at about 300
until skins blacken and then remove the skins - roasting hazelnuts
makes all the difference (don't eat them all separately-)
