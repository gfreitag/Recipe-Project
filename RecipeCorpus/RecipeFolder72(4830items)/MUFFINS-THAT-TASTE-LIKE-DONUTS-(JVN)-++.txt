Categories: Muffins, Doughnuts, Toppings, Favourites, Quick
Yield: 1 Dozen
1 3/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/3 c  Oil
3/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg
3/4 c  Milk
Jam (opt)
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Melted butter
3/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
Comment:  Better to make as 12 smaller muffins - giant ones cannot be
effectively coated.

In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. In
another bowl combine thoroughly oil, sugar, egg and milk

Add liquid ingredients to dry and stir only to combine.

Bake 350 for 20-25 min.

Shake muffins out immediately and while hot, dip in melted butter,
then sugar and cinnamon.

For a delicious variation, fill tins 1/2 full of batter, put 1 t jam
on top, and top with the rest of the batter.
