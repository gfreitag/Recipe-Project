Categories: Mexican, Soups, Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 lb Calf's foot
2 lb Honeycomb tripe
1 lg Onion
3    Garlic clove; peeled
6    Peppercorns
2 ts Salt; or to taste
4 qt ;Water
3 lg Chiles ancho
2    Green chiles, canned peeled
1 1/2 c  Hominy, canned
1 ts Oregano
Approx. Cook Time: 6:00

Cut the calf's foot into four pieces.  Cut the tripe into small
squares. Put them into the pan with the onion, garlic, peppercorns,
salt, and water. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower the flame, open the
windows(!) and simmer uncovered for about 2 hours, or until the tripe
and foot are just tender but not too soft.

Meanwhile, toast the chiles anchos well on a dry skillet, turning
them from time to time until the skin is charred. Slit them open
(wearing rubber gloves, if you like keeping your skin) and remove the
seeds and veins. Grind them dry to a fine powder. Add it to the pot
as the meat is cooking.

Remove the pieces of the calf's foot from the pan, and when they are
cool enough to handle, strip off the fleshy parts. Chop them roughly
and return them to the pan. Add the hominy and continue cooking the
menudo slowly, still uncovered, for another two hours. Adjust the
salt to taste. Sprinkle with oregano and serve.
