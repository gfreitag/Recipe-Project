Categories: Desserts, Tunisian, Holiday
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Semolina

1/2 c  Sugar

Masfouf is a desert snack traditionally served after the fast is
broken on Ramadhan evenings. It is, in fact, remarkably like the
various soojee (cream of wheat semolina) preparations encountered in
Kashmir and other parts of India. The techniques of assembling are
different, but the idea and ingredients are the same.

1. Mix the semolina and hot water in a bowl. Put it into the top
(kesskess) of a couscousier or a Chinese-style steamer and steam,
covered, over hot water for 10 minutes.

2. Remove the semolina to a bowl and stir in 4 tablespoons of the
butter. Mix and toss to separate the grains. Return the semolina to
the steamer and steam, covered, for 20 minutes. The semolina will
expand and will be cooked through.

3. Soak the raisins in hot water for 5 minutes and drain. Remove the
semolina the second time, stir in the balance of the butter, 4
tablespoons, and turn the semolina out on a serving dish. Add the
raisins, almonds, pine nuts and mix and toss together. Set aside a
few raisins and nuts to decorate the top of the Masfouf. Sprinkle the
Masfouf with the sugar and decorate with the raisins and nuts.

Serve at room temperature. Serves 6 or more.
