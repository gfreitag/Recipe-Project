Categories: Pasta, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Red onion
8 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 lb Italian canned tomatoes
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
10 lg Fresh basil leaves
Recipe by: Bugialli On Pasta Cut the onion into quarters. Place the
olive oil in a medium sized, flameproof casserole over medium heat;
when the oil is warm, add the onion and saute until the outer layers
are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes to the casserole
and cook for 25 minutes, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.
Remove and discard the onion, then pass the contents through a food
mill, using the disc with the smallest holes, into a second
flameproof casserole.  Place the second casserole over low heat and
reduce sauce for 10 minutes.

As the pasta cooks tear the basil leaves into thirds and add them to
the sauce.
