Title: OIGNONS CONFITURE (RED ONION RELISH)
Categories: Condiments, French
1 TB olive oil
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb red onions -- sliced very
thin
:
1 TB sugar
2 TB red wine vinegar
salt and pepper
:
2 TB dried fruit: raisins,
apricots, prunes) --
chopped
:
:
1/2 c  red wine

Heat oil in noncorrosive saucepan over medium heat. Add onions. Let
sweat gently until onions start to give off their juices.

Stir in sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper until the mixture starts to
melt. Add dried fruit and wine, then cover and reduce heat to lowest
setting. Use a heat diffuser on the burner, if necessary. Watch and
stir often, adding more wine or water as needed.

When the onions and fruit have melded and cooked down to a jamlike
consistency, taste and adjust seasoning.
Add more vinegar if needed to balance the fruit.

Note:  I stuff a tablespoon of this onion "jam" in small hollow
parboiled onions and roast them in the oven. -Kate Ratliffe, author
