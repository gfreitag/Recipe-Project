***ROASTING THE CHILIES ***

1. Lay dried mulato, ancho, pasilla, and chipotle chilies in a single
layer in 10x15" pans. Bake in a 300'F. oven until chilies smell
lightly toasted and are flexible, 5-8 minutes. While they are still
warm, discard stems and shake out seeds.

2. Rinse chilies and put in a large bowl; add 8 cups boiling water.
Let stand until soft, 20-30 minutes. Drain; save liquid. Smoothly
puree chilies, a portion at a time, in food processor or blender. Add
a total 2 cups reserved liquid. (In processor, use a little liquid to
get mixture moving; add rest when pureed.) Rub firmly through fine
strainer into a bowl; discard residue. Use, or chill airtight up to 1
day.

*** ROASTING THE VEGETABLES ***

1. In a 10x15" pan, combine onions, tomato, tomatillos, garlic (cut
side down), and tortillas. Bake in a 450'F. oven, turning
occasionally, until the vegetables and tortillas have dark brown
spots or edges. Let cool. Pull off vegetable skins and discard.

2. Smoothly puree mixture in a food processor or blender; add a total
of 1 cup reserved chili-soaking liquid, from step 1. (In processor,
use a little liquid to get mixture moving; add rest when pureed.) Rub
firmly through fine strainer into a bowl; discard residue. Use, or
chill airtight up to 1 day.

*** COOKING THE SEASONINGS AND THICKENERS ***

1. In a 10x12" frying pan over medium heat, stir sesame seed until
toasted, about 4 minutes; set aside.

2. To pan, add oil, plantain, almonds, peanuts, prunes, raisins,
cinnamon, coriander, and anise. Stir often over medium heat until
mixture is richly browned, 10-15 minutes. Smoothly puree mixture and
sesame seed in a food processor or blender. Add remaining
chili-soaking liquid, from step 1. (In processor, use a little to get
moving; add rest when pureed.) Use, or chill airtight up to 1 day.

*** ASSEMBLING THE MOLE ***

1. In a 5-6 quart pan, mix chilies, vegetables, seasonings and
thickeners, and broth. Bring to a simmer on medium heat; cover and
simmer to blend flavors, about 2 hours, stirring often.

2. Chop chocolate; mix with sauce until melted. Use mole as suggested,
following; or chill airtight up to 1 week or freeze up to 3 months.
