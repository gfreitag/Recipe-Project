Yield: 1 Batch

-(flounder) or cod
6    Egg yolks
2    Level tablespoons chopped
-spring onions (scallions),
-white parts only
1 ts Sesame oil
1/4    Level teaspoon MSG

"When the crab season ended, people were loath to give up the idea of
being without crab.  The following recipe is an excellent dish, but a
poor substitute for the heady concentrate of roe found in the furry-
clawed crabs of the Yangtse lakes."

Steam the fish for 10 minutes and flake it gently. Mix the egg yolks
together with the spring onions, sesame oil, MSG, salt and white
pepper. Add the fish and mix it in. Fry tablespoons of the mixture in
fairly deep fat, until the sides are almost brown or pinkish gold.
The fat will foam, but this cannot be helped. The final texture must
be firm. Serve hot with a separate dish of soy sauce mixed with
vinegar. Excellent with warmed wine.
