The poster wrote:  "This is yummy on baked chicken, ribs, beef or a
pork roast.  It is especially good when used on outdoor barbecues.
Fourth of July at our house always offered a rotisseried pork roast,
prepared over hot coals...my father brushed the sauce on the pork as
it cooked. Extra sauce was always served on the side.

"This has been in our family for over 40 years.  My mom got it from a
neighbor when she first got married...said she smelled the aroma in
her apartment hallway and knocked on the neighbor's door to get the
recipe."
