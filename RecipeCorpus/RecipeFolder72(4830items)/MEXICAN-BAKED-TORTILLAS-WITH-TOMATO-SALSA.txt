Soft flour tortillas, 7 to 9 inch diameter, are filled with potatoes,
bell peppers, and refried beans. We substituted a can of pintos that
was preseasoned with a bit of chipotle chili; coarsely chopped rather
than mashed the beans. This version is spicier than the original. *
Prepare the potatoes first. Drain and air cool. * Heat a little oil
in large skillet, saute onion and garlic until softened. Add a most
of or all of the remaining oil and add the bell peppers, potatoes,
diced chili, and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until potatoes are a
warm brown. Add the beans and mix well.  Season with salt, pepper,
cilantro, chili powder. Heat through. * Use vegetable spray to
lightly coat a cookie sheet. Set oven to 350F/180C. * Lay a tortilla
on a cutting board and fill with 1/4 of the skillet's mixture, along
one edge so that you can roll the tortilla into a buritto. Place the
tortilla on the sheet with folded side up; repeat. Use a little
vegetable spray on each folded tortilla. * Scatter the grated cheese
on top along the fold.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. ** Meanwhile, mix
the salsa ingredients in order listed, adding more or less tomato
juice as needed. Do not add the lime juice at this time. Use a hot
pepper sauce sparingly to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Stir and refresh with lime juice. (Note: leave peel on cucumber for
more color and fiber. Scrub well.)

Cooks TIP: If tortillas have been in the refrigerator for a while,
put a splatter screen on top of the pot while the potatoes are
cooking and soften the tortillas with steam. Wrap in foil, if
necessary, to keep warm and pliable.

Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese to around 480 cals, 16 grams fat. Pat
