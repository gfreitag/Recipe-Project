Recipe by: Felicia Pickering <MNHAN063@SIVM.SI.EDU> * plus butter for
greasing the pan

Butter a 7-by-4-inch loaf pan.  Line with wax paper, leaving an
overhang of about 1 1/2 inches all around to assist in lifting out
the pate later.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Rinse, dry and finely chop the mushrooms.  You should have about 5
cups. In a large saucepan melt the butter, and saute the onions and
celery until tender, about 5 minutes.

In a large bowl beat the eggs and cream cheese until smooth. Add the
bread crumbs, salt, basil, rosemary, oregano and pepper. Stir in the
onion mixture and the mushrooms. Blend well.

Spoon the mixture into the loaf pan.  Cover the top with foil, and
bake until firm, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool in the pan until lukewarm.
Remove from the pan, using the paper overhang as an aid. Serve at
room temperature with crackers as an appetizer.

Serves 12 to 14.
