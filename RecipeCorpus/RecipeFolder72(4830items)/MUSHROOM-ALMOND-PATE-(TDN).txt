Title: MUSHROOM-ALMOND PATE (TDN)
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Almonds
1/2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
2 ts Unsalted butter
1/2 cl Garlic, minced
1/8 ts Dried thyme
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 ts Sherry
1 ts Unsalted butter
1    Green onion, thinly sliced
For garnish
Place almonds in food processor or blender and process, using steel
blade, until finely ground.  Set the almonds aside.

Chop the mushrooms finely and set them aside for a moment. In a
medium-size, heavy, nonstick skillet over medium heat, melt the two
teaspoons butter and saute the minced garlic for a minute or two
until it realeases its fragrance.  Add the minced mushrooms and
continue to saute, stirring occasionally, until the liquid evaporates.

Add thyme, salt, pepper and sherry; simmer until the mushrooms are
dry.

Now add the last teaspoon of butter and the reserved ground almonds;
combine thoroughly.  Spoon into a serving dish. Cover the pate and
refrigerate for at least 30 mintues so the flavors can blend.

Garnish with sliced onions and serve with thin slices of French bread
or melba toast.
