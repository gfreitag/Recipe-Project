Title: MARY'S APRICOT PINEAPPLE JAM
Categories: Canning
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Dried apricots
1 lg Can crushed pineapple
(14 oz)
Sugar
Cut apricots and let soak in pineapple juice overnight.
Next morning combine the pineapple and the apricots and juice in
sauce pan.  For each cup of pineapple/apricot mixture, add 1 cup of
sugar. Cook over a medium heat, stirring *CONSTANTLY* (this is the
only hard part) until the mixture starts to thicken. Since it "sets
up" as it cools, put it immediately into sterilized jars after taking
off stove. Seal with paraffin.  (makes about 5 jelly glasses full)
This makes *great* Christmas presents! Me ke aloha, Mary Spero
