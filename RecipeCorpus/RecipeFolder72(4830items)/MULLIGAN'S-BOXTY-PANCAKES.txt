Title: MULLIGAN'S BOXTY PANCAKES
Categories: Pancakes
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
6    Pontiac potatoes
2    Onions
2    Eggs
Self-raising flour
Salt and pepper
Peel the potatoes and onions and process together to a coarse puree.
Do not overprocess - the texture should be a bit rough. Add 2 eggs,
beaten, and salt and pepper to taste. Add enough self-raising flour
to make a batter with a thick pouring Heat a hotplate or large frying
pan, add a little oil and pour in a large ladleful of batter on one
side of the pan and another on the other (there probably won't be
room for more than two pancakes at a time).

Cook on medium heat until the pancakes are golden brown underneath,
then turn and cook the other side. Serve with apple sauce (made by
stewing sliced granny smith apples with a little water, sugar and
lemon juice and stirring from time to time until a soft puree).
