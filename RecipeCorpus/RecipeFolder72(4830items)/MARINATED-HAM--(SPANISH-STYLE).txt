Categories: Meats, Main dish, Sauces
Yield: 30 Servings
15 lb Fresh, uncured ham
Salt
4 cl Garlic; 3 cut in slivers,
-1 minced
1 c  Fresh lemon juice
1 c  Fresh lime juice
Prepare ham the night before by trimming away some of the excess fat,
but leave as much skin as possible. Salt the meat to taste; cut small
slashes into the ham and wedge in the slivers of garlic. Mix a
marinade of minced garlic, lemon and lime juice.  Pour over meat,
cover tightly with foil, and refrigerate overnight.

When ready to cook, heat the oven to 300F.  Roast the meat about three
hours, basting evry half hour.  Bring the center of the ham to 165F
degrees (use a meat thermometer to check temperature). Just before
removing the ham from the oven, raise the heat to crisp the skin.
