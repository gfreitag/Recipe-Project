1/2 c  Garbanzo flour (70 g)

The next two (also from Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book) use the previous
recipe as a basis, with just a few changes.

GARBANZO RICE BREAD

This bread has a mellower flavor and keeps better than the plain
Brown Rice Bread.

Follow the mixing and rising instructions for Brown Rice Bread. Use
only two loaf pans and bake slightly longer, about 50 minutes to an
hour.

SOY-RAISIN RICE BREAD

Denser, cakier, more filling, this bread adds variety and interest.
The slice is golden in color and soft, almost like pound cake.

6 cups brown rice flour (600 g) 2 tablespoons soy flour (7 g) 1
tablespoon salt (16.5 g) 2 2/3 cups tepid water (635 ml) 4 teaspoons
active dry yeast (1/2 oz or 14 g) 1/2 cup warm water (120 ml) 1/3 cup
honey (80 ml) 1/4 cup oil (60 ml) 1/2 cup raisins (70 g) 1/4 cup
methocel (28 g)

Mix and let rise like Brown Rice Bread, incorporating the soy flour
into the first mixing and the raisins along with the honey. Divide
the dough into two loaves only, and bake cooler and longer, at 325
deg.F. for 50 to 60 minutes, or until done.
