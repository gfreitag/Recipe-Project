The potato has had a roller-coaster history. From South America, its
culture spread rapidly in the years following the discovery of the New
World. Spain and Italy grew the potato first on the Continent, and it
was firmly established in England by 1629, when John Parkinson, in
his A GARDEN OF PLEASANT FLOWERS, pronounced the Virginia potato, as
he called it, almost as good as the Spanish potato (we call the
latter sweet potato). He recommended cooking this sweet vegetable
with wine, sugar, and spices.

For sheer comfort, few dishes can equal a steaming baked potato,
freshly split, anointed with butter, and sprinkled with salt and
pepper. The addition of a meat or cheese topping makes the baked
potato a substantial entree. From Moscow, Idaho, home of the baking
potato, A.J. Marineau sends us a recipe for such a dish.

=======================================================
============== ====

Pierce potatoes in several places with a fork. Set potatoes on oven
rack and bake at 400'F. until potatoes give readily when squeezed,
about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a 1-1/2 to 2 quart pan over medium-high
heat. Add onion and stir often until limp, about 5 minutes. Mix milk
with cornstarch and stir into pan alongside with buttermilk and
marsala.

Stir over medium-high heat until boiling. Add cheese and stir until
melted. Stir in ham, mustard, and horseradish; if sauce is ready
before potatoes, set aside. To use, stir over medium-high heat until
hot.

Split potatoes in half lengthwise; fluff centers with a fork. Set 2
halves on each plate and spoon sauce onto potatoes. Sprinkle with
chopped parsley; season to taste with salt and pepper.
