Categories: Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 18 Servings
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla extract
3 dr To 4 yellow food color
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 c  Flaked coconut
36    Jelly beans
=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 350 F. In a medium sized
bowl, with an electric beater on medium speed, beat the sugar, egg
vanilla, and food color until well blended. Beat in the flour until
smooth, then fold in the coconut. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls 2
inches apart onto cookie sheets that have been coated with nonstick
baking spray. With a floured thumb, press an indention into the
center of each cookie mixture to create a "nest." Bake for 10 to 12
minutes, or until the edges are golden. Remove from the oven and
gently push 2 jelly beans into each nest. Let the nests cool slightly
on the cookie sheets, then remove to wire racks to chill completely.
Store in airtight containers.
