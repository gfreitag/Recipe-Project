Title: NOODLES WITH SNOW PEA GREENS
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb Snow pea greens
2    Red chilies
x  Some rice wine (sake,
Shaohsing, whatever)
1/2 c  Chopped shallots
12    Fresh shiitake mushrooms
2 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Rice vinegar
4    Chopped scallions
8    To 12 ounces japanese
Noodles (soba, udon,
Whatever -- I used soba)
Lightly steam pea greens -- crisp, but cooked. Chop chilies, shallots
and scallons.  Slice shiitake thinly.

Heat large non-stick skillet.  Roast chilies for a minute, then add
about 1/4 cup rice wine.  Add shallots and cook till they just start
to darken (about 4 minutes).  Add more wine if it starts to stick.

(put water on to boil for noodles)

With wine cooked off, add shiitake.  They should give up their own
water. Cook another 3-5 minutes till mushrooms are fully cooked and
pan is drying out.  Add soy sauce, vinegar, and scallions. Cook for a
minute and then turn off burner and set aside.

Water for noodles should be boiling, add noodles and cook till done,
about 5 minutes usually.

Toss noodles, pea greens and mushrooms.  Eat.

Ya know, slivered shiitake reminds me of tripe when it cooks. I bet
if you substituted shiitake for the tripe in a good recipe it would
make a tasty dish.
