Title: MIKE'S STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Chicken breasts, skinless
-and boneless
Salt and fresh ground black
-to taste
4    Thin slices processed ham
4    Thin slices mozzarella chees
4    Cooked asparagus spears
Flour for dusting
3 tb Butter
1 tb Oil
6 tb Marsala
2 tb Chicken stock
Asparagus spears to garnish
Place the chicken pieces between pieces of damp waxed paper and
beat/roll with a rolling pin until thin. Season with salt and pepper,
place a slice of ham and cheese and an asparagus spear on each
breast. Roll each breast up carefully, wind a piece of cotton string
around each to hold it and dust with the flour.

Heat 2 T of the butter and the oil to a saute pan and fry the chiken
rolls until golden and done.  About 15 minutes, turning to brown on
all sides. Remove the string and transfer to a hot serving dish and
keep warm.

Add the marsala, stock and remaining butter to the pan, bring to a
boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, while scaping the bottom of the
pan. Spoon this over the rolls and garnish with asparagus spears.

The recipe calls for Bel Paese cheese.  I never could find it, so
used a thin slice of Monterey Jack, Swiss or Mozzarella. Like the
Mozzarella the best.  Doubt that you have marsala wine, so I used
half brandy and half sherry.  Or all of one of the other depending on
what I hadn't already drank up.  A sweet sherry effect is what you
are looking for.

OK, that is as fast as I can type.  May I go get a cup of coffee now?
