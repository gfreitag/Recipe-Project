Title: MCDOUGALL'S NUT MILK
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Water
3/4 c  Raw cashews or blanched
Almonds
Place water in blender, add nuts, blend at high for 60 seconds. Keep
refrigerated, it will spoil.

According to my Wellness Encyclopedia, here's the breakdown for 3/4
cups of almonds; Calories 587 Fat 52 grams Protein 16 grams Saturated
Fat 5 grams Carbo 24 grams

That would make a 1 cup serving around 13 grams of fat, around 80%
calories from fat ((13*9)/(587/4)).
