Categories: Soups, Japanese
Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
6 c  Dashi (soup stock)
1/4 c  Chicken breast
1/2 c  Carrots; finely chopped
1 c  Potatoes; finely diced
2    Scallions; chopped
-finely
1/2 c  Miso (bean paste)
Sansho (Japanese pepper),
Minced,
Dashi (Soup Stock)
(optional)
1    Nori (Japanese seaweed)
5 c  Water
1 c  Flaked dry bonito
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Soy sauce
In a saucepan, bring the dashi to a boil.  Remove the chicken from
the bone and dice.  Add the vegetables and the chicken to the stock
and cook low, until tender. Add the miso and cook gently another 5
minutes. Remove from heat and pour into soup bowls. Sansho may be
added when serving. Rinse the nori well and place in the water in a
saucepan. Bring to a boil quickly and remove the nori.  Add the
bonito to the still boiling broth, then remove from heat immediately
and let stand about 2 minutes. Strain through a clean cloth and
season with salt and soy sauce.

Judi's Notes:

1) Dashi is a fish stock that is light and clear used in Japanese
cooking as a soup base.

2) The recipe does not specify how much Nori (seaweed) to use. It
states a quantity of 1.  Try using a 5-inch piece from a sheet of
Nori and if that is weak put in more.
