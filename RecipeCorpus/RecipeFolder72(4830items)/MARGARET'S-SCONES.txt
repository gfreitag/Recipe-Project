Sift dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Cut in shortening
until it is the size of small peas. Using a small bowl, beat eggs,
then beat in milk and pour into flour mixture. Stir just until
blended; do not overmix or dough will become tough. Fold in raisins.
Roll out dough on floured surface until 2 inches thick, then cut into
rounds on greased baking sheet. Bake in oven preheated ot 425 degrees
for 12 - 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Makes about a dozen.

Recipe by Margaret Hayes. These scones appear in the movie The Dance
Goes On. Montreal actress Louise Marleau takes them to a Gaspe fair.
