Title: NUT TORTE
Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings
3/4 c  Margarine
2 1/4 c  Sugar
Egg replacer
-- (equivalent of 3 eggs)
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 pn Salt
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
3/4 c  Soy milk, plain or vanilla
2 c  Chopped walnuts or almonds
1/2 c  Vegan marzipan
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

To prepare the dough, cream the margarine with 3/4 cup sugar until
fluffy. Add the egg replacer, lemon juice, and salt and mix well. Add
the flour and baking powder, and mix until a soft dough is formed.

Place two-thirds of the dough on a sheet of plastic wrap. With a
rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle about 11 inches in
diameter. Invert the dough into a 9-inch springform pan. Peel the
plastic wrap off the dough and press the dough into the bottom and up
the sides of the pan. Trim the edges if needed. Roll the remaining
dough into a circle about 9 inches in diameter and set aside.  This
will be used to top the torte.

To prepare the filling, stir 1 cup of the sugar in a large heavy
saucepan over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the
heat and boil the sugar unti it turns a caramel color. Add the soy
milk (which will bubble vigorously) along with the nuts and the rest
of the sugar. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, for 5
minutes. Remove from the heat and beat the marzipan into the mixture.
When it is well mixed, pour it into the cake pan and put the
rolled-out dough on top.

Bake the torte until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool completely
before removing the springform.
