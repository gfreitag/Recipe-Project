Categories: Appetizers, Cheese, Davidson
Yield: 6 Servings
15 oz Chili beans in chili gravy
9 tb Picante sauce
15 oz Corn tortilla chips
4 c  Cheddar; grated
1    Avocado
1 tb Lemon juice
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
1 tb Onion; grated
4    Scallion; with top, chopped
1 c  Olive, black pitted; chopped
1    Tomato; chopped
Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Mash the beans with one-half cup of the
picante until well mixed.  Grease two 9" x 13" baking pans. Place
half the chips in each pan, then spoon the bean mixture over them.
Sprinkle the grated cheese on top.  Bake for about minutes or until
the cheese is melted and beans are bubbling.

Meanwhile, peel, pit and mash the avocado, then mix it with the lemon
juice, 1/2 cup of the sour cream, the grated onion, and 1 tablespoon
of the picante. Garnish the nachos with the guacamole you just made,
the remainder of the sour cream, scallions, tomato, and olives.
