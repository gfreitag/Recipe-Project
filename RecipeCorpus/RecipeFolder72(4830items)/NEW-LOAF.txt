Title: NEW-LOAF: SUPER POTATO BREAD
Categories: Breads, Machine
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 sm Potato, peeled and halved
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb Granulated sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 ts Quick-rising yeast
In saucepan of boiling salted water, cook potato for 10-15 minutes or
until tender; drain, reserving 3/4 cup cooking water.

Mash potato well to make 1/2 cup. Let potato and cooking liquid cool
to room temperature.

From large (1-1/2lb to 2lb) bread machine, remove baking pan. Add to
pan (in order) cooking water, oil, sugar, salt, mashed potatoes and
flour. Sprinkle with yeast, making sure yeast does not touch water
mixture.

According to manufacturer's instructions, choose cycle appropriate to
nonsweet- or nonfresh-milk bread.

When baked, immediately remove pan from machine; shake loaf from pan.
Let cool completely on rack.

Because yeast thrives on starch, adding mashed potatoes to this loaf
creates an airy, even-textured bread. Ideally suited for hearty
sandwiches and toasts beautifully.
