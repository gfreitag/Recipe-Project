Title: NEW YEAR'S DAY BLACK-EYED PEA SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Black-eyed peas,dried
2 qt Water,more if needed
1    Ham bone with "trimmings"
3    Onion,medium,chopped
2    Bay leaves
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
Wash the beans well in cold water several times, then place in a
large, heavy stew pot and cover with water. Allow to soak overnight.
The next morning (start early ~ beans like to take their time), pour
off the soaking water, and ham bone, 8 cups of water, onion and
seasonings. Put on the back of the stove and let simmer gently until
beans are very tender, usually about 4 hours. Add more water if
needed. Remove and discard ham bone. If the water looks a bit scant
pour in 1-2 cups more. When beans are good and tender remove about a
cupful of the beans and mash well with some of the bean liquid. (This
can be done in a blender, of course.) Return mashed beans to pot,
taste for seasoning, and serve steaming hot over freshly cooked white
rice.
