Categories: Seafood, Casseroles, Tuna
Yield: 6 Servings
6 oz Tuna in water, drained
- and flaked
1 md Sized tomato, chopped
1/3 c  Shredded mozzarella cheese
1 ts Dried dill
1 c  Biscuit baking mix
2    Eggs
1/4 ts Black pepper
=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 4000F. Lightly grease a 9
inch pie plate. Sprinkle the tuna, tomato, cheese, and dill evenly in
the pie plate. Blend the milk, biscuit baking mix, eggs and pepper in
a blender on high speed for 15 seconds, or with a hand beater or wire
whisk for 1 minute, until smooth. Pour into the pie plate. Bake foe
30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out
clean. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. Note: Go ahead and add
your own favorite flavorings or veggies. Oh, there are so many
"lighter" options available, too. For instance, you can use skim
milk, light cheese, and even reduced fat biscuit baking mix instead
of the "regular" versions. And you can also use an egg substitute
(1/2 cup refrigerated egg substitute equals
2    eggs)
