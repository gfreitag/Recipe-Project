Heat 1/2 cup of the stock in a large saute pan and add the onions.
Simmer, covered, until onions are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the
mushrooms and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
the paprika, cayenne, lemon zest, and the remaining stock and simmer
briskly for about 10 minutes until reduced by one-third (1/3). Season
to taste with salt and pepper. Remove the pan from the heat, let the
mixture rest for about 5 minutes, and then swirl in the yogurt.
Sprinkle with chopped dill or parsley. Serve with slices of baked
polenta, steamed brown or wild rice, or noodles. Serves 2 to 4.
