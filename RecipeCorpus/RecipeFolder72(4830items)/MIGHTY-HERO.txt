Slice bread in half horizontally, using an electric or serrated
knife. Carefully remove soft bread from inside each half, leaving 1/2
inch-thick shells.  Set aside; reserve soft bread for another use.
Combine vinegar and next 5 ingredients in shallow baking dish; add
mushrooms, tomato slices, and onion rings. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes.
Drain with a slotted spoon, reserving marinade. Brush marinade
evenly inside each bread cavity.  Spoon 1 cup zucchini into bottom
half; arrange half of mushroom mixture over zucchini. Layer with 4
turkey slices and 3 cheese slices. Repeat layers with remaining
zucchini, mushroom mixture, turkey, and cheese. Top with remaining
half of loaf. Wrap loaf securely in aluminum foil-chill until ready
to serve. To serve, unwrap and slice loaf into wedges.
