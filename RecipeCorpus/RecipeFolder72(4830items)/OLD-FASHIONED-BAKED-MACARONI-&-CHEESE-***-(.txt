Nothin' fancy here, but it works for me. I love mac and cheese. This
is a huge recipe, so I always halve it and it still is more than
enough to feed my family of 4. It's from the Mission noodles company.
Got it right off the package. Cook macaroni as directed on package.
Pour cooked macaroni into 3 qt. baking dish. Melt butter in saucepan
over low heat; blend in flour, salt, pepper and mustard. Add milk and
Tabasco, cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until sauce is
thick and smooth. Remove sauce from heat; stir in cheese until
melted. Combine sauce with cooked macaroni. Mix together melted
butter, crumbs and paprika. Sprinkle crumbs over macaroni. Bake at
350F 25-30 minutes.
