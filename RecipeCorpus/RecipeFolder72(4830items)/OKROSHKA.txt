Title: OKROSHKA
Categories: Russian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Meat, cooked
1    Cucumber
2    Eggs, hard-boiled
3    Onions, green
1 ts Sugar
2 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Sour cream
4 c  Apple cider
This chilled meat and vegetable soup is a popular Russian dish. It's
served with ice cubes in it.  Since there's no substitute for Russian
Kvass, a fermented and slightly alcoholic liquid made from grain, the
ingredients in this recipe will have to do.

You may substitute 3 c beef stock and 1 c white wine for the apple
cider.

Dice meat.  Peel and dice cucumber and eggs.  Slice green onions.
Combine first 4 ingredients.  Mix together sugar, mustard, sour
cream, and cider, and beat well. Add beef mixture and chill. Serve
sprinkled with dill.

Sylvia's notes: I used apple juice and leftover corned beef, and it
was wonderful.  Absolutely addictive.
