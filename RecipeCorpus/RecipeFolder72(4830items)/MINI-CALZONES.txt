Recipe by: Jenna <JFULLER@UGA.CC.UGA.EDU> * like you put on pizza

Fold out pizza dough and cut into about 2" by 2" squares, pressing
seams wherever necessary.  Place 1 T. ricotta, 1 T. mozarella and a
Tablespoon or so of whatever combination of the remaining ingredients
you want i.e. I used spinach and onion, pepperoni and green pepper,
etc. etc.... Fold dough over filling, pressing edges together (like a
half-moon shaped turnover). Brush calzones with melted butter and
bake on a baking sheet at 400 for about 30 minutes- they should be
golden. I served them with a small bowl of commercial marinara sauce.
