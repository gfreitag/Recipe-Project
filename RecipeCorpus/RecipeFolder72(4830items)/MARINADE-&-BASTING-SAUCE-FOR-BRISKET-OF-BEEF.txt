Title: MARINADE & BASTING SAUCE FOR BRISKET OF BEEF
Categories: Cajun, Sauces, Outdoor
Yield: 8 Servings
3 c  Dry red wine
1 c  Olive or peanut oil
2 T  Wine vinegar
2 t  Onion powder
1 t  Garlic powder
3 t  Salt
3 T  Poupon mustard
2 T  Prepared horseradish
3 T  Lime juice
2 t  Ground cayenne pepper
Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour over whole beef
brisket.  Let marinate for several hours, or overnight if possible.
Also, use this marinade as a basting sauce.  Some people may find
Justin's 3 cups of dry red wine a little bit too much for their
taste. No problem, use as much as you like in the sauce, and drink
the rest. Sure won't go to waste.
