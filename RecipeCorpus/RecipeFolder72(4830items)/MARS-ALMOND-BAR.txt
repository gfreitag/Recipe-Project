Categories: Copycat
Yield: 14 Bars
2 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 c  + 2 tb. water
pn Salt
2    Egg whites
35    Kraft caramels
2/3 c  Whole roasted almonds
24 oz Milk chocolate chips
In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup,
1/2 cup of the water, and the salt. Heat to boiling, then cook using
a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature.

Beat the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks. Don't use a
plastice bowl for this.

When the sugar mixture reaches 270~F, or th esoft crack stage. Remove
from the heat and pour the mixture in thin streams into the egg
whites, blending completely with an electric mixer set on low.

Continue to mix about 20 minutes or until the nougat begins to harden
and thickens to the consistency of dough. Mix in the almonds.

Press the nougat into a greased 9 x 9 inch pan and chill until firm
about 30 minutes.

Melt the caramels with the remaining 2 tb. water in a small saucepan
over medium heat.

Pour the caramel over the nougat and return the pan to the
refrigerator.

When the caramel and nougat are firm (about 30 min), slice down the
middle of the pan with a sharp knife adn then slice across into 7
segments to make a total of 14 bars.

Melt the milk chocolate chips in a microwave for 2 minutes on half
power, stirring halfway through the cooking time. Melt completely,
but be careful not to overheat.

Resting the bar on a fork (and use fingers if needed) dip each bar
into the chocolate to coat completely and tap the fork against the
side of the bowl to knock off the excess chocolate. Place on waxed
paper and let cool at room temperature until the chocolate is firm
1-2 hours.
