MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
6 sl Boiled ham (thin slices)
1 c  Mozzarella cheese
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 tb All-purpose flour
3 sl Mozzarella cheese
Preheat oven to 400'F. Lightly oil a 9x5x3" pan.

In a large bowl, combine the meatloaf ingredients, adding more bread
crumbs if necessary, a tablespoon at a time, to make a firm loaf.
Lightly spray a large piece of aluminum foil. Place the meat mixture
on the foil, and form into a 12x8" rectangle.

Arrange the ham on top of the meat, leaving a small margin around the
edges. Sprinkle shredded cheese on top of the ham slices. Starting
from the short end, carefully roll the meat mixture jelly-roll style.
Seal the edges and ends.

Place the loaf seam side up in the prepared pan. Sprinkle the top of
the meatloaf with the flour. Bake 1 hour or until done. The center of
the loaf will be pink because of the ham. Top the loaf with slices of
cheese, then return to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese
melts. (Option: Broil the loaf to melt the cheese. Watch it
carefully.)
