Separate garlic into cloves and crush slightly with side of knife. Do
not peel.

Add garlic, onions and vegetable oil to a soup pot and saute until
onions just begin to soften. Do not brown. Add stock, wine, bay, sage
and cloves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer partially covered
for 45 minutes. Strain pressing down firmly on the solids to extract
all flavor. Return soup to pot and correct seasoning with salt,
pepper and lemon juice.

In a bowl, whisk olive oil into egg yolks by drops to form an emulsion
(mayonnaise). At serving time, beat 1 cup of hot soup into emulsion
in a thin stream. Gradually beat in remaining soup. Return to pot and
reheat gently being careful not to over heat or egg will scramble.
Serve immediately garnished with croutons, cheese and chives.
