Here's the recipe for Nasi Kuning.  Ignore the reference to Crisp
Beef. It's not necessary and is a lot of trouble to fix. Otherwise,
the recipe is easy and good.

Heat the oil in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until
hot. Add the rice and stir until it begins to brown, now add the
cloves, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric and pepper; stir for a minute or
so. Pour in the broth, add the salam or bay leaf. Bring to a rapid
boil then cover and reduce the heat to a very low simmer.  Simmer for
about 40 minutes. Garnish with Crisp Beef, Onion Flakes, thin strips
of bell pepper, and paper thin slices of cucumber.

FRIED ONION FLAKES: Heat one Tablespoon oil in a heavy frying pan over
medium-high heat. Add 1/2 cup dried onion flakes and stir until brown
and crisp.  Stores well in an airtight container.
