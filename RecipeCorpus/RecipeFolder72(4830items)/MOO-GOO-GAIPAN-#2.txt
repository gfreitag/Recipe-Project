Title: MOO GOO GAIPAN #2
Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
-breast
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Fresh grated ginger
1 tb Corn starch
1    Head/bunch fresh bok choy
1/2 lb To 3/4 lb fresh mushrooms
1/2 lb Fresh snow peas, stringed &
-halved
2 c  Chicken stock/bouillon
2 tb Corn starch
2 tb To 3 tb peanut oil
Remove any fat or tendons from the chicken and slice into pieces 1/4"
by 1" or so (this works better if chicken is partially frozen). Mix
chicken with next three ingredients and allow to marinate while you
are preparing the vegetables.

Wash bok choy thoroughly, trim off the tough ends of the leaves and
part of the base, and chop into bite-size pieces including the green
parts. Slice the mushrooms. Cut the snow peas in half or slice after
the tips and strings have been removed.  Mix the stock and the corn
starch in a shaker

Heat oil in wok until its almost smoking and then stir fry the chicken
until its almost cooked through.  Then add the vegetables and stir fry
until the bok choy leaves get sort of wilted down. Pour in the
stock/cornstarch mixture that was shaken just before pouring it in.
Stir constantly until the sauce thickens. Serve immediately over
cooked rice.

Note:  You can add bamboo shoots, sliced water chestnuts and all
sorts of other stuff to this but I like the plain version best. About
the only thing I change is to throw in some Mrs. Dash, which isn't
very Chinese, but heh! Enjoy.
