1 x  Or Cayenne pepper (more for
2 tb Ground cumin
1 lb Lean pork, ground
5 lb Boneless beef chuck,
1 x  Trimmed of fat, cubed 1/2"-3
2 ts Oregano
2 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
28 oz Italian plum tomatoes,
1 x  Canned, with juice
24 oz Good amber beer
1 x  (New Amsterdam, Dos Equis)
13 oz Beef broth
2 ea Bay leaves
34 oz Kidney beans
In a large flame-proof casserole or stockpot, heat the oil. Add the
onions.  Cover and cook over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Uncover,
increase heat to moderately high and cook, stirring frequently, until
the onions begin to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook another 1 or 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add
the chiles and cumin.  Cook, stirring, 1 minute then add the pork,
mashing and stirring, until the meat browns and begins to separate.
Add the beef, oregano, salt and pepper.  Increase heat to high and
cook, stirring frequently, until the meat loses most of its redness,
about 10 - 15 minutes.
Add the tomatoes and their liquid, the beer, beef broth and bay
leaves. Bring to a boil, partially cover and reduce heat to moderate.
Cook until the beef is very tender and the sauce is reduced to a
chili-like consistency, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
In a medium saucepan, heat the beans in the liquid from the cans.
Drain when hot and either add to the chili or serve on the side along
with other accompaniments such as steamed rice, sour cream, grated
cheddar cheese, thinly sliced scallions, onions, or chips. Serves 10
