Title: NERO WOLFE'S BACALHAU (PORTUGESE SALT COD)
Categories: Fish, Side dish, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2    To 2 lbs soaked dried cod *
2 lg Onions, sliced
6 tb Butter
1 cl Garlic, minced
3 lg Potatoes
2 tb Bread crumbs
10    Pitted green olives
10    Black olives
4    Hard-cooked eggs
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
Wine vinegar
Olive oil
Fresh ground black pepper
* NOTE: To prepare dried cod, soak in cold water for about 24 hours,
or until it is completely moistened. Change the water two or three
times. Drain thoroughly.

Put the cod into a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover. Bring
to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the
fish is tender. Drain; remove skin and bones. Flake the meat with a
fork into large pieces. Saute the onions in 3 tablespoons of butter
until they are tender and golden in color. Add the garlic. Boil the
unpeeled potatoes in salted water. When they are tender (about 20
minutes), remove from the heat, put under cold running water, and
remove the skins. Drain and slice into 1/4-inch pieces. Preheat the
oven to 350 deg.F. Grease a 1 1/2-quart casserole with the remaining
3 tablespoons of butter. Arrange a layer of half the potatoes, then
half the cod, then half the onions. Sprinkle with a little pepper and
repeat the layering. Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the top layer.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through and lightly browned.
Before serving, garnish the top with olives and eggs; sprinkle with
parsley. Serve with the wine vinegar and oil in cruets and black
pepper in a small dish.
