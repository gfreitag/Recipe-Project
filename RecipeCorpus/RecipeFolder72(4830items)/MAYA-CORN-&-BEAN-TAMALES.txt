: Just saw this recipe in today's _L.A. Times_.  I've been looking for
something like this.  It explains that in pre-Columbian times, the
Mayans didn't use lard in their tamales. change anything in this
recipe and haven't tried it yet, but it looked like it should be
shared! The recipe apparently comes from "Americas First Cuisines"
