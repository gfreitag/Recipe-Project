4    Chicken breasts
2    Green onions
1    Celery stalk

1. In large shallow saucepan, pour in water to depth of 2 inches; add
peppercorns, bay leaf and garlic. Heat over medium heat until
simmering (small bubbles form but do not break surface of water).

2. Add chicken to pan in single layer, meaty side down; cook for 15-20
minutes or until no longer pink inside. Using tongs, transfer chicken
to plate; let cool in refrigerator for about 1 hour or until chilled.
[Chicken can be covered and stored for up to
4    hours.]

3. Dressing: in small bowl, whisk together yogurt, mayonnaise,
parsley, lemon juice, mustard and pepper. (Dressing can be covered
and refrigerated for up to 8 hours.]

4. Meanwhile, thinly slice onions and celery. Pull off skin from
chicken. Pressing small paring knife against bone, cut off each
breast to remove in 1 piece. Cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch wide
strips; cut crosswise into 1/2-inch cubes.

5. One apple at a time, slice off 1 side close to core; repeat 3 more
times. Layer each piece cut side down; cut in half horizontally.
Holding layers together, cut into 1/2-inch wide strips; cut crosswise
into 1/2-inch cubes.

6. In large bowl, combine chicken, green onions, celery, apples and
pecans. Add dressing and stir gently to coat well.
