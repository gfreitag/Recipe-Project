Title: OIL CAKE (GLIKO TAPSIOU ME LADI)
Categories: Greek, Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 1 Cake
1 1/2 c  Oil *
1 1/2 c  Orange juice *
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Brandy (or slightly more)
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Ground cloves
1/2 c  Walnuts
1/2 c  Raisins
600 g  Flour
A few sesame seeds
A little oil
*[NOTE: Original recipe calls for "1-1/2 glasses of oil and 1-1/2
glasses of orange juice".  No mention of what size glass, as is
typical of Greek cookbooks.]

Combine the oil, the orange juice and sugar.  Dissolve the soda with
the brandy and add it to the mixture also; add the cinnamon and the
ground cloves.  Then very gradually add the flour, stirring
constantly. Finally, combine the walnuts and the raisins with the
mixture. Coat a medium-sized baking tin to spread the mixture evenly.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for 40-50 minutes. Cut to serve
into oblong pieces.
