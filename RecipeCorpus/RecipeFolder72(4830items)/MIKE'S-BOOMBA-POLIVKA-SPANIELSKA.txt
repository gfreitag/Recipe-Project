This is an old Ruthenian peasant dish, very popular in the Carpathian
Alps, as well as here in Fair Oaks, CA. Great for warming the tummy
on a cold winter day. This is easy to prepare, and good as a luncheon
dish served with salad, or as a first course soup prior to a lighter
entree.

Combine all ingredients except macaroni in a saucepan and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat, simmer 15 minutes. Add the cooked macaroni to
soup. Heat a few minutes longer. Top each serving with a generous
amount of parmesan cheese. Great with rye toast spread with garlic
butter.
