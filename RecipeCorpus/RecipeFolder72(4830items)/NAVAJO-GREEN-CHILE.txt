Based on a recipe from some chile cookbook), makes 6-8 servings? Broil
(blacken) the green chiles until the skin is blistered and loose -
remove skin while warm and discard seeds and stem. Chop in 1" square
pieces and put in large chile pot or crock pot. Cut off fat from pork
and save. Cut pork into 1/2" squares and set aside. Melt pork fat in
frying pan and saute onions and garlic - add to pot. Substitute veg.
oil or skip the sauteing to minimize fat (and taste). Brown pork in
same pan - add vegetable oil if needed - add to pot. Cut tomatoes and
green peppers into large pieces and add to pot.  Take out you
contacts now if you wear em. Finely chop habenaros and add the rest
of the ingredients. Bring to a boil and then simmer (uncovered!) as
long as you can stand it (adding water or beer as necessary).  Simmer
for 2 hours minimum to even out the heat. Serve with plenty of warm
flour tortillas. Notes: 1. Thought I'd submit my favorite green chile
recipe.  Two caveats:  it takes a while to make but its worth it, and
this recipe has been thoroughly modified from the original so feel
free to experiment yourself. 2. Beware, this "chile" kicks butt and
gets hotter after freezing.  This also makes a great chile-egg
burrito the next morning. "Durnell, David V."
