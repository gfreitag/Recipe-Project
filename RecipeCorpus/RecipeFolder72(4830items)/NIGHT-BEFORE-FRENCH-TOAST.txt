favorite of hers.
Grease a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish with the 1/2 tsp. butter or
margarine.  Arrange bread in one layer in baking dish.
In a large microwave safe bowl or pan, mix eggs, salt, sugar, milk
and vanilla.  Place the bowl in the microwave and heat on HIGH for
five (5) minutes, stirring twice.
For heating on the range, place the egg mixture in a medium
saucepan and heat on medium, stirring as needed, until hot, BUT NOT
BOILING, about 5 minutes. Be careful not to let the mixture boil,
because it will set the eggs.
Pour the hot egg mixture gently over the bread slices and cover with
plastic wrap.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.....
To bake - dot with the 2 tbsp. butter pieces and place uncovered
pan in cold oven.  Bake at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes, until
bread is puffy and lightly brown. Remove from heat and let stand 5
minutes.
Serve with Cary's SF Syrup, sugar free jelly, or fresh fruit.
