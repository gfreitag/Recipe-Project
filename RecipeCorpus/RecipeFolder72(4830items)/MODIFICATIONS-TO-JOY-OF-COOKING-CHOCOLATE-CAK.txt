Title: MODIFICATIONS TO JOY OF COOKING CHOCOLATE CAK
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
None
I've had good results modifying the 'quick oil cake' in the Joy of
Cooking. If you have the book, make all of the usual substitutions:
applesauce for oil, defatted cocoa for cocoa, ener-g egg replacer for
eggs. To make it really chocolatey, I halve the sugar amount, add an
extra 1/4-1/2 c. of cocoa. I usually double the recipe because my
housemates can snarf the whole cake in 12 hours (which acts as a
major control on *my* consumption :-) . If you don't have the book,
and want the recipe, let me know and I'll write one up and post it.

For frosting, I just mix up a little rice milk, cocoa, and powdered
sugar and make a glaze, and pour it on the warm cake so it soaks in a
bit.
