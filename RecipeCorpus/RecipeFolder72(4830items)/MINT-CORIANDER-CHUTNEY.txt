palates.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Coarsely chop coriander, mint, and peppers.

make a coarse paste. Transfer to a nonmetallic container.

Heat oil in a saucepan.  Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add
cumin seeds and stir until fragrant. Remove from heat and add to
chutney. Mix well before serving.

The chutney is best when made just before serving, but leftovers may
be refrigerated and used within 24 hours.
