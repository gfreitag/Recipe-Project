Title: MOM'S BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Egg
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Bread Cubes
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Butter, melted
1/8 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Chocolate Chips
Beat egg until light, add sugar and milk, then pour over torn up bread
cubes.  Add spices, butter, salt and chocolate chips, stir well. Pour
into a baking dish, set this in a pan of water and bake in a slow
oven (300 degrees) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until firm. Serve as is,
with milk or cream on it or with any sauce. Also good cold.

I don't always use a water bath when I make it because I like mine
extra crisp and not overly soggy in the middle. > Submitted By
