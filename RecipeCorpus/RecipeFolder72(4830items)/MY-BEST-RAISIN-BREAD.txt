Title: MY BEST RAISIN BREAD
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 999 Servings
1 1/8 c  Water
3 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Browm sugar
1 1/2 tb Butter
1 1/2 tb Dry milk
1 tb Cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Dry yeast
3/4 c  Raisins
Place all ingredients in order listed (for Hitachi machine). Set on
regular or rapid bread settings. Adjust as needed for your machine.

This was adapted by me from a recipe which came with my machine. I
find this to be equal to the raisin bread we used to get fresh from
the bakery. It is a heavy, rich and sweet loaf. Excellent for
snacking or breakfast.
