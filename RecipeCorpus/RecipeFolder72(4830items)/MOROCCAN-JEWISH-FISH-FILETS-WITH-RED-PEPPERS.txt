Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1/4 c  Vegetable oil or olive oil
2    Red bell peppers stemmed,
-seeded diced
20    Garlic cloves, minced
6 tb Minced cilantro
1 1/2 lb Sea bass or halibut filets
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 ts Paprika
2 c  Water
This flavorful fish dish, dotted with bright red peppers, cilantro
leaves and a generous amount of garlic, is a favorite of Moroccan
Jews. It is simple to make and is delicious hot or cold.

Heat the oil in a saute pan large enough to hold fish in a single
layer. Add the peppers and saute lightly over medium heat for 2
minutes. Add garlic and cilantro and cook over low heat, stirring,
for 1 minute.

Add fish and sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika. Add water and
bring to a simmer, basting fish occasionally. Cover and cook over
very low heat about 8 minutes, or until fish is just tender (when a
thin skewer is inserted into center of fish, it should come out hot
to the touch).

Using a slotted spoon, transfer fish to a deep platter. Boil the pan
juices, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1/2 cup. Taste for
seasoning, then pour over fish. Serve hot or cold. PER SERVING: 250
