Categories: Canning, Preserving, Vegetables
Yield: 9 Half-pints
4 lb Firm peppers*
1 c  Bottled lemon juice
2 c  White vinegar (5 percent)
1 tb Oregano leaves
1 c  Olive or salad oil
1/2 c  Chopped onions
2    Garlic cloves; quartered
-- (optional)
2 tb Prepared horseradish
-- (optional)
Yield: About 9 half-pints.

(Bell, Hungarian, Banana, or Jalapeno)

* Note: It is possible to adjust the intensity of pickled jalapeno
peppers by using all hot jalapeno peppers (hot style), or blending
with sweet and mild peppers (medium or mild style).

For hot style: Use 4 lbs jalapeno peppers.

For medium style: Use 2 lbs jalapeno peppers and 2 lbs sweet and mild
peppers.

For mild style: Use 1 lb jalapeno peppers and 3 lbs sweet and mild
peppers.

Procedure: Select your favorite pepper. Caution: If you select hot
peppers, wear rubber or plastic gloves while handling them or wash
hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face.

Peppers may be left whole. Large peppers may be quartered. Wash,
slash two to four slits in each pepper, and blanch in boiling water
or blister in order to peel tough-skinned hot peppers.

Peppers may be blistered using one of the following methods: Oven or
broiler method: Place peppers in a hot oven (400 degree F) or broiler
for 6-8 minutes or until skins blister. Range-top method: Cover hot
burner, either gas or electric, with heavy wire mesh. Place peppers
on burner for several minutes until skins blister.

Allow peppers to cool. Place in pan and cover with a damp cloth. This
will make peeling the peppers easier. After several minutes of
cooling, peel each pepper. Flatten whole peppers. Mix all remaining
ingredients in a saucepan and heat to boiling. Place 1/4 garlic clove
(optional) and 1/4 teaspoon salt in each half pint or 1/2 teaspoon
per pint. Fill jars with peppers, add hot, well-mixed oil/pickling
solution over peppers, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations in Table 1.
