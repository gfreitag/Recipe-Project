Recipe by: FWDS07A    Patricia Dwigans Put the 1 cup of cooked mashed
potatoes in a clean quart container. Add sugar, salt and warm water.
Mix well. Cover with a clean cloth and place in a warm locationfor
2-3 days or untl mixture ferments, bubbles up and smells pleasantly
sour. Use at this time or store in the refrigerator in a clean
plastic container. Cover of container should have a small hole
punched to allow gases to escape. Sourdough breads made rom this
starter will not taste any different than any other starter or have
any of the lavor of potatoes Replenish with equal portions of flour
and warm water added to the starter. Allow to ferment at room tep for
8-10 hours and ten return to refo. If starter is not used and
replenished once a week, stir down after 3-4 weeks, discard 1/2 of it
and replenish the balance with same recipe first used. A sprinkle of
dry yeast may be needed if starter doesn't appear bubbly and ferented
after being in use for a period of time. If a clear liquid forms on
top of mixture, simply stir down and continue to use as needed.
