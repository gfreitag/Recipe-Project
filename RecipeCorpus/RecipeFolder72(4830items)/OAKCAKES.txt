Title: OAKCAKES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pt Mixed milk and water
1 oz Yeast
6 oz Fine oatmeal
3 oz Plain flour
1 ts Salt (or slightly less)
Mix the flour, salt and oatmeal. Warm the liquid and stir in
gradually to make a smooth batter. Crumble in the yeast, stir gently
and leave to stand in a warm place for 20 mins. Stir again and cook
in a stong, well greased frying pan. Pour in enough batter to cover
the base fairly thinly and trun out when cooked.

Remarks: This recipe is heavily adapted, but works. Traditionally the
oat cakes were cooked on a `backstone' - a stone or iron sheet, over
an open fire. It is still possible in some places in Yorkshire to buy
a `girdle', a cast iron sheet, about 12 in diameter, with a hoop
handle - these are ideal. When cooked, the oatcakes where hung on
plain wooden rack suspended from the ceiling, known as bread fleaks.
The oatcakes were eaten either fresh or dried.

They can be fried with bacon, or suttered and eaten alone with cheese,
treacle, golden syrup etc.
