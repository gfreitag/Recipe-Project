Title: MOCHA BUTTERCREAM
Categories: Cakes, Toppings
Yield: 2 Servings
1/4 c  Instant coffee powder
2 ts Water
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter at
-room temperature
1/4 c  Confectioners sugar
3/4 c  Plus 2 Tablespoons heavy
-(whipping) cream, chilled
Flavored lightly with coffee, this variation on Rosie's Buttercream
has a lovely cafe au lait color.

1. Dissolve the coffee in the water.

2. Place all ingredients in a food processor and process until light
and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stop the machine several times to scrape
down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.

3. Transfer the buttercream to a medium sized mixing bowl and, using
the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, continue to beat on
medium-high speed, until the buttercream is white and fluffy, 15 to
20 minutes. Stop the mixer to scrape the bowl several times with a
rubber spatula (If you do not have a paddle attachment, you can use
the whisk) Use the buttercream for frosting within an hour or it will
need rewhipping.

Makes 2 to 2.1/4 cups, enough to fill and frost a two- or four-layer
cake
