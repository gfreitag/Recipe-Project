*I have never used nuts in this recipe, nor has Aunt Hushie, who was
the first to make it!! Mix all ingredients except coconut. Sprinkle
coconut on wax paper and roll mixture on coconut into 2 log-shaped
strips. Freeze. When ready to use, cut in sliced.

AUNT HUSHIE'S METHOD: Mix in melted chocolate, sugar, vanilla and
lemon juice. Pour this mixture over marshmellows in a large bowl.
Spoon out onto coconut covered waxed paper and shape into MARILYN'S
VERSION: Ingredients: 1 lb. Dark Chocolate Coating, 1 Bag Mini-Multi
Colored Marshmellows, 1 Bag Coconut. In a microwave-safe glass bowl
on HIGH for 2 minutes, melt chocolate. Pour over marshmellows. Spoon
onto coconut covered waxed paper. Shape into logs. Put into freezer
until firm. Slice when ready to use. These cookies look beautiful on
any cookie tray. Work with the recipe--can be tricky first few times,
until you find the method easiest for you. Ruth from PA
