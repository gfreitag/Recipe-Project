Title: MUSTARD SAUCE (PRODIGY)
Categories: Sauces, Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Champagne or white wine
2    Anchovy fillets
- roughly chopped
2 tb Finely minced shallots
3 tb Dijon mustard
1/3 c  Whipping cream
1 tb Butter
The tang of Dijon mustard and the smoothness of whipping cream
combine with the light flavor of champagne or white wine to make this
a wonderful, easy sauce for fish.

COMBINE THE BROTH, anchovies, shallots and mustard in a small
saucepan over medium heat on the stove. Bring to a boil and cook
until liquid reduces by about 1/3 and begins to thicken. Add the
cream and continue to cook until the mixture becomes saucelike and is
thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and
whisk in the butter. Serve immediately or keep warm in a water bath.

Makes 1 Cup
