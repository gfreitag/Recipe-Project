Memphis Style refers to the John Wills method and recipe of
:
John Wills Bar-B-Que Pit, in east Memphis Tennessee. John and his
family have provided pork ribs "crunchy brown on the outside and lean
white in the middle with a sweet and tangy sauce." Step #1: The
Memphis starts with rubbing a spicy dry marinade into the meat before
cooking.
Step #2: Tending the ribs on a long, low, smokey fire, of white oak
or hickory. Basting with a second marinade, turning often on a
horizontal rack, every half hour or so. Cook over a (225F) degree,
smokey fire. Cooking could take 5 to 9 hours depending on the size of
the cooker etc. Stop using the basting sauce about an hour before
serving.
Step #3: Warm the Memphis sweet sauce and either brush it on during
the last 20 minutes of cooking or serve it on the side.
Weber Method;
See #1 above and then. cook on low indirect fire on a large weber
kettle with chunk style charcoal. Use a water filled drip pan under
the ribs, a boiling pot of water over the coals. Stand the ribs up on
edge in a vertical rack, and try to cook the ribs on a calm day,
(wind under 10mph).
Cook 5 to 7 hours basting often (every half hour), with the basting
sauce, STOP using the basting sauce about an hour before serving.
See step #3 above for sweet sauce tips.
