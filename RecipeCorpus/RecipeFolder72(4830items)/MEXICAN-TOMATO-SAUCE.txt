Title: MEXICAN TOMATO SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Canning
Yield: 7 Quarts
2 1/2 lb -to...
3 lb Chile peppers
18 lb Tomatoes
3 c  Chopped onions
1 tb Salt
1 tb Oregano
1/2 c  Vinegar
Yield: About 7 quarts

Procedure: Caution: Wear rubber gloves while handling chilies or wash
hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face. Wash
and dry chilies. Slit each pepper on its side to allow steam to
escape. Peel peppers using one of the following methods:

Oven or broiler method: Place chilies in oven (400 degree F) or
broiler for 6-8 minutes until skins blister.

Range-top method: Cover hot burner, either gas or electric, with
heavy wire mesh. Place chilies on burner for several minutes until
skins blister. Allow peppers to cool. Place in a pan and cover with a
damp cloth. This will make peeling the peppers easier. After several
minutes, peel each pepper. Cool and slip off skins. Discard seeds and
chop peppers. Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30 to 60
seconds or until skins split. Dip in cold water, slip off skins, and
remove cores. Coarsely chop tomatoes and combine chopped peppers and
remaining ingredients in large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cover.
Simmer 10 minutes. Fill jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Adjust lids
and process according to the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2
depending on the method of canning used.
