12 oz Mushrooms, cleaned, sliced
Or cut in chunks
2 md Onions, halved andsliced

Add mushrooms, peppers and onions to a large non-stick pan. Saute over
medium-high heat until onions are soft and golden. (You may need a
squirt of non-stick cooking spray if you don't have a non-stick pan).

larger amount listed) and mix well.  Cook covered over the lowest
heat (simmer) for 20 minutes.
