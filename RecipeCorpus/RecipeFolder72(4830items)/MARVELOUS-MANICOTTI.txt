Title: MARVELOUS MANICOTTI
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 2 Servings
6    Manicotti noodles, *cooked,
Rinsed & drained*
1/2 pk Frozen chopped spinach,
*thawed and squeezed
Dry(er)*
1/2 c  White mushrooms
1/2 c  Shitake mushrooms
1/2 c  Onion
1/2 c  Pepper, *sauteed in red
Wine, open a nice bottle &
Drink the rest*
1 c  Fatfree cottage cheese (or
That dryer kind of cottage
Cheese)
4    Cloves garlic sauteed w/ the
Rest of the stuff
I forgot!
Italian herbs to taste
1/2 c  Fatfree Parmesan
All measurings except the six noodles (which serves 2) are
approximate. Really, I guess you can put in about anything you like.
I left the mushrooms out of Ben's because he's weird that way.
Anyway, stuff this mixture into the shells. You may have some left
over. So sue me. Put them in a baking dish and pour one jar of
Healthy Choice f/f spaghetti sauce over the noodles. Bake at 400 F
for about 45 minutes. This is very easy and I hope you like it as
well as we do. Mangia!
