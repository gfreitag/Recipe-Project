Categories: Bread/muffi, Eat-lf mail, Low fat
1 c  chopped dates
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 c  raisins
1/2 c  Dried Cranberries -- *Note
1 c  water
1/4 c  Lowfat Margarine -- **Note
1/4 ts salt
2    Egg Beaters=AE 99% Egg
Substitute -- ***Note
:
1 ts vanilla extract
1 c  all-purpose flour
1 ts baking soda

*NOTE:  Sally's recipe used 1/2 C dried prunes, chopped...I didn't
have any at the time so I used dried cranberries. **NOTE: Sally's
recipe used 1/2 C margarine...I adapted it. ***NOTE: Sally's recipe
used 2 beaten eggs...I adapted it. ****NOTE: Sally's recipe used 1/2
C mixed nuts, chopped...I omitted them.

In a saucepan combine dates, raisins, prunes (dried cranberries) and
water. Bring to boil and boil 5 minutes. Stir in margarine and salt.
Set aside to cool. Add remaining ingredients to fruit; stir just
until dry ingredients ar= e moistened. Spoon into greased MINI-muffin
pans. (I spooned it into 12 regular muffin tins.)  Bake in preheated
350-degree F oven for 15 minutes. (If desired can bake in a greased
11 x 7 x 2-inch pan for 30 minutes.)

Yield: 32 mini-muffins. (OR 12 regular size muffins)

These were FANTASTIC!! I had tasted them when Sally made them using
her recipe...and they were really wonderful!! But I wanted to lower
the fat a bit more and adapted th= e recipe a bit more. I think they
are excellent.
