Dough: 1. Pour hot water over flour; mix with fork. When cool enough
to handle, finish mixing with your hands until dough holds together.
Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until chilled through.

2. Work one piece of dough at a time; pinch off a walnut-sized chunk,
shape into a ball, knead several times, then roll flat on a floured
board. 3. Place dough circle in the palm of your hand; in the middle
of the dough, place about 1 tbsp filling.  Bring up edges and seal at
top with little gathers.  Leave a tiny hole at top for steam to
escape during cooking. 4. Line steamer or bottom of skillet with kale
leaves. Top with a layer of dumplings and steam over boiling water 15
to 20 minutes. If using a skillet use just enough water to cushion
the Mo-Mos; replenish water as needed. Serve immediately, pairing
Mo-Mos with soy sauce, ginger, and vinegar. May also be served with
Achar.

Khote Filling: 1. Melt butter in skillet. Add onion and garlic and
cook over low heat until onion is limp. Add chiles and spices and

salt and cayenne to taste.
