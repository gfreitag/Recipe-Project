This may be the earliest printed recipe for chili con carne and it is
surprisingly authentic, save for the suspect addition of "espagnole",
white sauce seasoned with hame, carrot, onion, celery, and clove. The
words are Mrs. Owen's own.

This might be called the national dish of Mexico. Literally, it means
'pepper with meat' and when prepared to suit the taste of the average
Mexican, is not misnamed. Take lean beef and cut in small dice, put
to cook with a little oil. When well braised, add some onions, a
clove of garlic chopped fine and one tablespoon flour. Mix and cover
with water or stock and two tablespoons espagnole, 1 teaspoon each of
ground oregano, camino, and coriander. The latter can be purchased at
any drug store. Take dried whole peppers and remove the seeds, cover
with water and put to boil and when thoroughly cooked pass through a
fine strainer. Add sufficient puree to the stew to make it good and
hot, and salt to taste. To be served with a border of Mexican beans
(frijoles), well cooked in salted water.

Frijoles or Mexican brown beans. Boil beans in an earthen vessel
until soft (four to eight hours). Mash and put them into a frying pan
of very hot lard and fry until comparatively dry and light brown.
Sometimes chopped onions are put into the lard before the beans are
added and sometimes pods of red pepper or grated cheese.
