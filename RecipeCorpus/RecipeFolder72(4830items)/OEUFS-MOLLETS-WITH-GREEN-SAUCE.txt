Title: OEUFS MOLLETS WITH GREEN SAUCE
Categories: Eggs, Brunch, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Eggs; boiled for 4 minutes
75 g  Peas, cooked
75 g  Asparagus, cooked
25 g  Sunflower margarine; melted
5 tb Bchamel sauce
A little single cream
Salt and pepper
Parsley sprigs to garnish
A sauce of pured peas and asparagus is the coating for soft-boiled
eggs in this recipe. Lovely summery food, best served with rice and a
tossed salad - and some warm, fresh bread on the side.

Plunge the boiled eggs into cold water as soon as the four minutes
are up. When they are cold, peel very carefully, making sure not to
break the white. Pure the peas and the asparagus together with the
melted margarine and bchamel - the pure should be smooth and a
lovely shade of green. Thin out with a little single cream and season
to taste. Divide the mixture into the bottom of two ramekin dishes.
Put the eggs on top and garnish with a sprig of parsley. Serve at
room temperature.
