Title: MOUSSAKA (VEGETARIAN EGGPLANT & CHEESE)
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb (about 4) eggplant,
-stems removed
2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Corn oil
4    Cloves garlic, chopped fine
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
6 oz Tomato paste
1 1/2 c  Water
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese, grated
This Jewish-style moussaka does not have meat since the kosher laws
prohibit mixing meat and milk together. The result is a complete
vegetarian dish with considerable dimension.

1.  Cut each eggplant lengthwise into 3 equal slices. Sprinkle with
the salt and let stand for 20 minutes, Dry the slices on paper towels
to absorb the liquid that accumulates. Set aside.

2.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a pan and stir-fry the garlic
over moderate heat until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato
sauce, tomato paste, and water and mix well. Simmer the sauce over
low heat until it becomes thickened, about 15 minutes.

3.  Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a skillet. Dip the
eggplant slices into the beaten eggs and fry over moderate heat for 2
minutes.  Fry all the eggplant slices this way.

4.  Assemble the moussaka in this manner.  Put a layer of eggplant
in a heatproof glass or metal baking dish. Cover with about 1/2 cup
of the cooked tomato sauce. Sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of the
grated cheese.  Cover this another layer of eggplant, then sauce,
then cheese. The last layer (there should be three) ends with the
cheese. Bake in a preheated
350    degrees F oven for 1/2 hour.

Serve warm.  Serves 6 with spaghetti or other dishes.
