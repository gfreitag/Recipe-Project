Title: NORMAN'S FAVORITE CHOCOLATE FUDGE
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/3 c  Granulated sugar
1    4.6 oz pkg JELLO Brand
Vanilla cook & serve pudding
Mix
3 tb All natural butter flavored
Sprinkles
2 tb Dutch Processed European
Style cocoa
4 tb Instant non-fat dry milk
Powder
1 c  (+2T) water
1 tb Pecan pieces (would be
Optional)
If using an electric stove, preheat the largest burner to highest
setting Line a 6" x 8" x 2" pan or dish with aluminum foil. No need
to veggie spray the foil since the fudge will not stick.

Combine all ingredients (except the pecan pieces) in a 10" dutch oven
(he uses cast iron).  Place on preheated burner and bring to a full
rolling boil while stirring continuously - Cook 4.5 minutes, stirring
continuously with a stainless steel whisk.

Remove from heat and continue stirring until mixture stops boiling.

Set a sheet pan (approx. 10" x 15") on top of a cold wet towel (cold
tap water is fine).  Pour mixture onto the sheet pan. Using a
spatula, move mixture around so as to combine and blend those fudge
crystals beginning to form on the bottom of the pan.

After 2-3 minutes move sheet pan to a fresh cold towel and continue
blending

After a few minutes move sheet to another cold towel and as mixture
starts to thicken begin moving and accumulating the mixture to the
corner of the pan. As mixture becomes very thick, pour out into the
foil lined pan. Spread fudge evenly and sprinkle the pecan pieces on
top.
