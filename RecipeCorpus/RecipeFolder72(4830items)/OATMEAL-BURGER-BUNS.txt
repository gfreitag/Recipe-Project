Title: OATMEAL BURGER BUNS
Categories: Vegetarian, Breads
Yield: 16 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1/4 c  Molasses
4 tb Dairy free margarine
2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Brown sugar
2 c  Oatmeal (uncooked)
1 c  Boiling water
1 c  Cool water
2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
Measure 1/4 cup warm water and stir yeast and 1 tablespoon of the
molasses in the water. Let stand until bubbly.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine margarine, remaining molasses,
salt, brown sugar, oatmeal and the boiling water, stirring until
margarine melts.

Add cool water and yeast to above mixture. Beat in 4 cups of the
flour, 1 cup at a time.

Turn out the dough onto a floured board and knead until smooth,
about 5 minutes, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking.
Turn dough over in a greased bowl; cover and let rise ina warm place
until doubled (about 1 hour).

Punch dough down and divide into 16 equalpieces. Shape each piece
into a smooth ball. Place balls about 2 inches apart on greased
baking sheets and flatten slightly. Cover and let rise in a warm
place until doubled (30 or 40 minutes.)

Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until lightly browned, about 20
minutes.

Note: This recipe can be shaped into 2 loaves and placed in greased
9 x 5-inch loaf pans. Allow to rise until double and bake in a 350
degree oven about 40 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped
on bottom.
