Title: MARINATED CUCUMBER & RED BELL PEPPER SALAD
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
2 oz Dry cellophane or bean
Thread noodles
2 c  Peeled, seeded, and sliced
Cucumbers
2 c  Thinly sliced red bell
Peppers (I chopped them into
Chunks )
1 c  No-oil Italian dressing or
Vinaigrette (I used less
Than 1C -- about 3/4)
1 tb Freshly minced basil
1 tb Freshly miced cilantro
1/8 ts Red hot chili flakes (I made
My own from dried chilis)
Lettuce
Drop the noodles into boiling water until done (length of time
depends on type; read the label). Drain. Toss all ingredients
together and marinate for at least 1 hour. Serve on a bed of lettuce.

Other tips:

I used 3.5 oz of noodles, and less dressing. The chili makes it hot
so if you don't like spicy, it would be fine to leave it out. You may
want to break the noodles a little before cooking (but not too much).
I made the mistake of not breaking them and ended up having to cut
them a little in order to get my ingredients to combine properly.

This salad is even better the next day. I imagine it travels nicely
because it isn't too soupy.
