Title: MICHEL RICHARD'S PASTRY EGGS
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
Puff pastry  -- frozen
Pastry cream
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Sugar
pn Salt
Vanilla bean  -- split
5    Egg yolk
1/3 c  Cornstarch
Glaze
Roll out little circles of pastry leaving the two edges slightly
thicker than the sides. Sprinkle with sugar. Cook the pastry cream
ingredients until it boils and is thick. Cool. Place a generous
tablespoon or so of cream on the pastry dough and two apricot halves
so it looks like two egg yolks. Bake in 350F oven for 35 minutes.
Brush pastry and apricots with a nice sweet apricot glaze. The baking
takes the sweetness out of the fresh apricots so you need this final
step.
