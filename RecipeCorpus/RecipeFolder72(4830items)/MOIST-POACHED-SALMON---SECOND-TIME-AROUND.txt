(Start with 4 steaks so you have enough for next day, second time
around).

Arrange salmon steaks, over dill stalks, in a single layer a shallow
skillet wide enough to accommodate them without crowding. Season with
salt and pepper. Add enough wine and water to completely cover
salmon; add peppercorns. Slowly bring liquid barely to a simmer.
Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until top of salmon looks
opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn heat off and let stand covered for 10
minutes or until other parts of your meal are completely cooked.
Remove 2 salmon steaks from poaching liquid and blot both sides of
fish with paper towels. Top with tomato sauce. Leave other steaks in
liquid until completely cooled to room temperature. Then remove, and
refrigerate, covered for next day.

Yield: 2 servings
