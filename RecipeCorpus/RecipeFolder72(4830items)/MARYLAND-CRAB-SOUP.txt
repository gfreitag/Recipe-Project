Title: MARYLAND CRAB SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Recipe
4 c  Water
2    12 oz cans tomatoes,
-minced
1/2 lg Onion, chopped
2    Carrots, sliced
1 cn Sweet corn
1/2 lb String beans, cut into
-1 inch pieces
1    Hot pepper, minced
Old Bay seasoning, to
-taste
1 lb Crabmeat
Put everything but the crabmeat into a large pot and bring to a boil.
Cover and simmer, adding crabmeat, for about 2 hours. Don't buy the
lump crabmeat, it's a waste. I used leftover crabmeat and clawmeat,
which gives it a bit more sweetness. If you're buying crabmeat, it's
probably best to by 1/2 lb each of claw and backfin.
