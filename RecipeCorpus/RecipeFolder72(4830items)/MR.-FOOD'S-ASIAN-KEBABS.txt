Title: MR. FOOD'S ASIAN KEBABS
Categories: Meats, Sirloin, Kebabs
Yield: 16 Servings
16    Wooden or metal skewers
1/4 c  Firmly-packed brown sugar
1/4 c  Sherry
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2 ts Crushed garlic
2 ts Sesame oil
1 lb Sirloin steak, 1 inch thick,
- sliced into 1/4-inch
- thick slices
======================================================= ====== If
using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 15 to 20 minutes.
Preheat the grill or broiler. In a small bowl, combine all of the
ingredients except the steak; mix well. Add the steak, cover, and
marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Thread the s NOTE: These
are not the typical American type of kebabs because they've only got
meat on them. So, why not grill some colorful veggies alongside
these, for serving with them? That way everything can be done just
right, instead of having the usual overcook
