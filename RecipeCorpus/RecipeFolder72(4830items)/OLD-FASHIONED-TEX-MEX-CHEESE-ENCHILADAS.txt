Title: OLD FASHIONED TEX-MEX CHEESE ENCHILADAS
Categories: Cheese
Yield: 1 Lot
4 tb Flour
1 ds Black Pepper
3 tb Chili Powder
3 c  Boiling Water
1/4 c  Melted Butter or Oil
12    Corn Tortillas
2 ts Ground Cumin
10 oz Grated Cheese(cheddar/jack)
1 ts Salt
1 lg Onion diced or chopped
1    Beef Bouillon cube
1/2 c  Green Pepper diced or chopt
1/2 ts Garlic Powder
1 1/2 c  Cooking oil hot for frying
Brown the Flour at about 450F. for 10-15 minutes; do not let it burn.
Combine the browned flour with the other dry ingredients and blend
with the butter (oil) over low heat until smooth. Slowly add the
boiling water, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously. Add
the bouillon cube and stir as you add the remaining water. Simmer the
sauce for about one hour, stirring occasionally. Fry the Tortillas,
one at a time, for about five to ten seconds per side in the hot oil
(they should not get crisp, this is just to "cook" them a little --
the time depends entirely on the temperature of the oil). Remove them
from the oil, draining excess oil back into skillet and then dip them
in the hot enchilada sauce. Place tortilla on a plate and spoon about
1 tablespoon of a mixture of the Onion and Green Pepper along a line
about 1-1/2 inch from the center of the tortilla. Place about 1
tablespoon of cheese along that line also. Carefully roll (it will be
hot) the tortilla around the filling and place it seam side down in a
rectangular baking dish. Repeat with all the tortillas. Pour the
remaining sauce over the enchiladas and then spread some of the
remaining onions/peppers over the top. Finally, top it with a
generous portion of the grated cheese. Bake at about 300F. for 15-20
minutes. DO NOT OVER COOK!

You can optionally add some spiced, cooked ground beef or some spiced
cooked boneless chicken to the filling; reduce the onion/pepper/cheese
amount by one-half and add one tablespoon of meat filling.
