Title: MEXICAN SHREDDED PORK
Categories: Try it, Mexico
3 lb Pork shoulder or roast, ~cut in 2" cubes
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1 t  Thyme*
1 t  Marjoram* Salt & pepper to taste
12 oz Pepsi or Coke
1/2 c  Orange juice

*This is a best guess - she wasn't measuring it. Heat a large skillet
over medium-high heat (NO FAT/OIL). When the pan is hot, add pork and
brown well on all sides (the meat is fatty & shouldn't need oil).
When meat is just about done, add the onion and cook till
transparent. Add remaining ingredients & bring to simmer. Cover &
cook 5 minutes. If there is still any liquid in the pan, uncover &
continue to cook until it's evaporated. Remove the pork to a plate to
cool. When cool enough to handle, shred the pork with your hands
removing as much of the fatty pieces as possible. Can be served alone
or in soft taco shells.
