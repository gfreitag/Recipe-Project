Preheat the oven to 300F. Pantry and Prep: lean, boneless center-cut
pork loin, cut into 1/4-inch by 1-inch pieces; 1 15-ounce can straw
mushrooms, drained may be substituted.

Spread each tortilla with 1 teaspoon hoisin sauce. Using scissors,
cut each one into 1/8-inch wide strips. Arrange the strips on a
baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, until crispy. Set aside until
needed.

In a small bowl, toss the pork with 2 teaspoons hoisin sauce, 1
tablespoon sherry, and sesame oil. Marinate for 1 hour in the
refrigerator.

Spray a Dutch oven or large nonstick saucepan with vegetable oil and
place over medium-high heat. Drain the pork, discard the marinade and
add the pork and saute for about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pork to a
separate dish. To the saucepan, add the garlic, carrots, and cabbage
and saute for 4 minutes, stirring, adding a few teaspoons water, as
needed to prevent sticking. Add the mushrooms, the rest of the
sherry, cornstarch-stock mixture, soy sauce, Worcestershire, ginger,
lemon juice, and peppers. Bring to a boil, stirring until thickened.
Return the pork to the soup and add the scallions. Top each portion
with the tortilla strips and scallions. [McRecipe:patH 18 Aug 96]
