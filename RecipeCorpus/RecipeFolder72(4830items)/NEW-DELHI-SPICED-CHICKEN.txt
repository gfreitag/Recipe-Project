* Pure chili contains only chili powder. There are no other spices in
it. Strengths vary from mild to fiery hot. If you cannot find pure
chili for this recipe, try regular chili.

1. Heat two tablespoons butter or margarine in a large skillet. Place
first six ingredients (all the spices) in skillet and brown for 1
minute over high heat. 2. Have the chicken breasts boned, skinned and
cut into bite-sized cubes. Place chicken in skillet with browned
spices; stir to coat well, then brown 1 minute longer or until
chicken has turned white on the inside (cut a piece to check). Remove
from pan and set aside. 3. Add remaining butter to pan and saute
onions over high heat until limp. Add remaining ingredients,
including browned chicken, and cook over medium heat until celery is
tender but still slightly crisp. Vegetables will give off some
juiciness as they cook.

Serve over brown rice.
