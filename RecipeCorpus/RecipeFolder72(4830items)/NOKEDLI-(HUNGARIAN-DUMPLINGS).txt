Title: NOKEDLI (HUNGARIAN DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Hungary, Pastas
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM-------------------LISA CRAWLEY  TSPN00B------------------------
1 c  Flour
3 sm Eggs
1/2    Egg shell of Club Soda*
Lg. Pot of Boiling Water
*Sour Cream may be substituted for Club Soda (about 1-1 1/2 tbs)
*Water may be used in place of club soda, but will make a heavier
dumpling If using lg. eggs, use 2 for every cup of flour Beat w/ a
wooden spoon in a lg. bowl. "Batter" should "crack" and snap and lg.
bubbles will rise. Batter should be stiff and very tacky, as in wall
plaster (odd comparison to a food...)  When batter is dropped from a
spoon, it will clump and fall very slowly, but in very lg. amts...
unlike pancake batter... Place a few lg. tbsp. of batter on a sm.
dessert dish. With an Ice Tea spoon, scrape pieces of the batter into
the boiling water, dipping the spoon into the boiling water to
facilitate ease of removing the dumpling. Repeat. Dumplings are done
when they rise to the top of the water. Strain. Mix w/ butter, serve
in soup, or top w/ your Chicken paprikas or szekely goulash. Can also
use a spatzel-maker to drop the dumplings in the water. NOTE: I use 7
c. flour and about 14 eggs. Makes a lg. amt. and we have leftover. I
just posted the ingred. for a sm. amt. as a basic recipe. Adjust
according to your needs.
