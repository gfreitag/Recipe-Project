Combine all dry ingredients (except for confectioners sugar). Add
liquid ingredients (except for 1 1/2 cups of oil) one at a time,
stirring between additions. Mix in apple. Let batter sit for 10
minutes. In a 1-quart saucepan over medium high-heat, heat the oil
until it crackles, not quite to the smoking point. Take precautionary
measures for using hot oil! Drop batter into the oil 1 tbls. at a

onto a paper towel when golden brown. Sprinkle with confectioners
sugar and serve.

Makes 15 to 18 fritters.
