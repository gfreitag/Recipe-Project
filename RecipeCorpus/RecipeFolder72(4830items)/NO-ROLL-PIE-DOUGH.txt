Title: NO-ROLL PIE DOUGH
Categories: Pies, Misc
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
3 tb Sugar
1 pn Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
6 tb Cold butter
1 lg Egg
COMBINE THE FLOUR, sugar, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl.
Cut the butter into six or eight pieces and distribute over the dry
ingredients. Rub in the butter finely, using fingertips or pastry
blender, until the mixture resembles a fine powder. DO NOT WORK THE
MIXTURE TO THE POINT WHERE IT BEGINS TO STICK TOGETHER. Beat egg with
a fork in a small bowl and stir into the flour-butter mixture: It
will remain dry and crumbly. Turn the dough out into a buttered 10-
to 11-inch removable-bottom tart pan or a 9-inch Pyrex pie pan.
Distribute the crumbly mixture evenly around the bottom and side of
the pan, pressing it into place with floured fingertips. As you press
the dough into place, it will adhere together and line the pan. Avoid
pressing the dough too hard or it will become thin in places. After
pressing the dough into the pan, inspect the surface for any
excessively thick or thin spots and press them even before
proceeding. Slide dough into a plastic bag and chill several hours or
overnight, or while preparing the filling. Makes one 10- or 11-inch
tart shell or 9-inch pie shell.
