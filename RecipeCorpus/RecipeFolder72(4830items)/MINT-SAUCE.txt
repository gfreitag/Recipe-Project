Title: MINT SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Irish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lg Handfuls of mint leaves
-(stems previously removed)
3 ts Granulated sugar
4 tb Wine vinegar
(From "English Country Cooking at Its Best" by Caroline Conran.
Villard, 1985).

Wash and shake the mint leaves, sprinkle then with the sugar and chop
them rather finely. Put in a bowl. Heat the vinegar and pour it over
the mint. Add more sugar if you think the sauce is too sharp. Serve
hot or cold with roasted lamb or other meat.

Alternatives: Use lemon juice instead of vinegar and you can also add
a little olive oil. This is not traditional mint sauce, being much
less violent in flavor, but it is exceptionally good.
