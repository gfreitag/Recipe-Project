Yield: 6 Servings

1 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
1 3/4 c  Granulated sugar, divided
1 3/4 c  Egg whites (about 11), at
-room temperature
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Cream of tartar
2 ts Vanilla
Fruit compote, optional (see accompanying recipes)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a small bowl, combine flour and cocoa with 3/4 cup sugar. Mix well
and set aside.

Place egg whites in a large mixing bowl. Add salt and cream of
tartar. Beat at high speed of an electric mixer until soft peaks
form. Test by turning off machine and raising beater slowly.
Gradually add the remaining sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, beating well
after each addition. Continue beating until stiff peaks form when you
remove the beaters.

With a rubber spatula, gently fold in the vanilla. Then sprinkle a
fourth of the flour mixture over the beaten egg whites. Using an
under-and-over motion, gently fold in the flour with the spatula. Do
5 strokes, rotating the bowl as you fold in the flour. Repeat three
more times, until the flour mixture is all used up. Then fold an
additional 10 strokes. Flour mixture should be blended into the egg
whites.

Gently pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake 35 to
40 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Invert tube pan
over the neck of a glass bottle. Keep the cake inverted until
completely cool, at least two hours.

With a sharp knife, carefully loosen cake from the pan. Serve plain or
garnished with a fruit compote.
