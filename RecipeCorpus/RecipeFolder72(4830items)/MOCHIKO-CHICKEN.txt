Title: MOCHIKO CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Chicken cleaned*
2 tb All Purpose flour
4 tb Cornstarch
4 tb Mochiko**
4 tb Granulated Sugar
5 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Chinese Oyster sauce
2    Eggs
MSG; Optional
Chopped green onions
7 tb Seasame seeds; to taste
*boned and cut up in bite sizes. **(Sweet flour made from glutinous
rice) Mix all of the ingredients with the cut up chicken in a large
bowl, stir well to coat all of the chicken. Marinate for two or three
hours. Fry in a large skillet as you would with normal fried chicken
until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. This basic
recipe is from the Honpa Hongwanji Buddist Temple Cookbook published
in Honolulu in 1973. That same Buddist temple has since then
published an additional four or five cookbooks. All of them I am told
are very good and offer a wide selection of island cooking covering
all of the ethnic groups in Hawaii not only the Japanese-Hawaiians.
Hawaii is a melting pot of races and it is also a melting pot of
cuisines with each of its many ethnic groups contributing to the rich
experience of Hawaiian foods. The island housewives "cook in many
languages" and I indeed enjoyed, and still do enjoy, "eating in many
languages" I hope this is the recipe you wanted Vicki. If not just
send a message this way and I will attempt to get just what you wish.
