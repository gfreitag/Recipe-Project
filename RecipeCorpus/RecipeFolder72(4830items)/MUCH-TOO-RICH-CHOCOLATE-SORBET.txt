Title: MUCH TOO RICH CHOCOLATE SORBET
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 3 Servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Droste cocoa
1/3 c  Sherry (add more sugar if
-you only
Have dry sherry in the house
:-), but it is best to use a
Cream sherry)
2 c  Water
Mix sugar and cocoa together in bowl.  Add water and whisk until
smooth. Add sherry and then taste to check if sweetness is to your
liking. Chill mixture a bit and then put in ice cream maker and
follow the directions that came with the device.  This concoction
will take longer than usual to freeze (perhaps as much 2 hours or
more). I like my chocolate bittersweet, so you may want to use more
sugar than I have. Also, depending on the size of your ice cream
maker, you may want to double the recipe.

Makes 3 cups, 6 servings.
