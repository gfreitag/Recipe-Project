The center of mid-South barbecue, Memphis offers a range of sauces
that take the high middle ground between Eastern and Western styles.
Like this version, they are often medium-bodied mixtures, moderate in
sweet, heat, and everything else except taste.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and
saute for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the onions begin to turn golden.
Stir in the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat to low, and cook
until the mixture thickens, approximately 20 minutes. Stir frequently.

Use the sauce warm. It keeps, refrigerated, for a couple of weeks.
