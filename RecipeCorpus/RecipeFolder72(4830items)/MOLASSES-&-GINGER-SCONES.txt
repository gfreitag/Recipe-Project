Title: MOLASSES & GINGER SCONES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 7/8 c  Whole wheat flour; -OR-
2 c  Unbleached white
2 tb Brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Ginger
4 tb Butter; cut into bits
1 lg Egg; beaten
2 tb Molasses
1/2 c  Lowfat yogurt
1/4 c  Raisins
PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment. Using a
wooden spoon, mix the flour, sugar, baking soda and powder and ginger
together. Stir in the butter, then the egg, followed by the molasses,
yogurt and raisins. Mix until too thick to stir. Flour a flat surface
and turn the dough onto it. Form the dough into a ball and knead
until it holds together nicely, adding flour if the dough sticks to
your hands. The dough should be slightly tacky. Pat the ball down to
1/2-inch thickness, and cut hearts from it. Place the hearts on the
cookie sheet and bake until golden brown and firm, about 15 minutes.
Serve with jam and tea. Makes 6 large heart-shaped scones.
