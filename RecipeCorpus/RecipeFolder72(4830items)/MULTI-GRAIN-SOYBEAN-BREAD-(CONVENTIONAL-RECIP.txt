1 pk (1/4 ounce) dry yeast
1 c  Water
2 c  Bread flour

Combine warm water, soybean oil, honey, and dry yeast into measuring
cup. Allow to stand 5 minutes.

Measure flours and other ingredients into mixing bowl. Blend warm
liquids into flour mixture. Beat with an electric mixer at medium
speed for two minutes, occasionally scraping the sides of the bowl.
The dough will be stiff.

Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead mixture until it
becomes smooth and elastic, and dough does not stick to the board.
Place dough in bowl that has been rubbed down with soy oil, and allow
to double in volume. Punch down. Knead lightly and shape into loaf.
Place in greased 9" x 4 1/2" loaf pan and let rise to double volume,
approximately 30 minutes.

Bake in 350 F oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool on rack.

Yield: one loaf of delicious and nutritious bread.
