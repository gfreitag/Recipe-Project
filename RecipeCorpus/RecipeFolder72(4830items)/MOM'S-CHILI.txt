Title: MOM'S CHILI
Categories: Entrees
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Ground beef
2 lg Yellow onions,
-chopped
1 lb Kidney beans
1/2 lb Tomato paste
6 oz Water
3    Garlic cloves
-(or more, to taste)
1    Bay leaf
Ketchup (1 "glub")
1 tb Chili powder
-(or more to taste)
Brown the meat and onions, separately if desired.  In a large, heavy
pot, combine the meat and onions, and the other ingredients except
the chili powder.  Simmer at least one hour. Six or more hours is
better. Stir in the chili powder.

NOTES:

*  A mild, hearty chili -- This chili won't win any awards in Texas,
but it's a nice, mild, flavorful dish. The recipe can easily be
multiplied; I usually make a triple batch and freeze the excess. For
a spicier chili, use more chili powder, or, even better, mix your own
spices. Yield: Serves 4-5.

*  I usually use more garlic; the cloves can be left whole and will
become soft and mildly flavored by simmering.

*  The flavor is best if the chili sits for a day before being served.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 to 6 hours cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
