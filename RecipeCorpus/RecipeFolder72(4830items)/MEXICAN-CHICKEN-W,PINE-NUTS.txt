Title: MEXICAN CHICKEN W/PINE NUTS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Roaster chicken
6 tb Dry sherry wine
Salt to taste
1 tb Ground cinnamon
1/2 c  Pine nuts
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
1/4 c  Raisins
2 tb Flour
1/4 c  Blanched slivered almonds
Quarter chicken, carefully removing any lumps of fat from body
cavity. Put chicken pieces in a pan with just enough salted water to
cover and cook gently, covered, until chicken is tender. This will
take 45 minutes or more, depending on the quality of the chicken.
Meanwhile, grind pine nuts finely in an electric blender or food
processor. In a small pan, melt 6 tablespoons butter and saute ground
nuts until a rich golden color. Drain chicken pieces, reserving
cooking liquid, and return them to the pan. Cover and keep hot. Melt
remaining butter in a small pan. Stir in flour and cook, stirring
constantly, to a golden brown, nutty roux. Gradually add 1 1/4 cups
reserved chicken liquid, stirring vigorously to prevent lumps
forming. Bring to simmering point, stirring.  Add nuts and their
butter, the sherry and cinnamon mixed with sugar. Mix well and bring
to a simmering point once more.  Pour over chicken pieces and cook
gently, covered, for 15-20 minutes longer. Finally, stir in raisins
and slivered almonds. Taste for seasoning, adding a little more salt
if necessary. Simmer for 5 minutes and serve.
