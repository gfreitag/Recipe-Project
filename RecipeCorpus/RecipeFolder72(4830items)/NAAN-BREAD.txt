Categories: Indian, Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
2 oz Fresh yeast, or
3 tb Yogurt
1 1/2 lb Fine whole wheat flour
1 ts Wild onion seeds
Lukewarm water
Melted butter or ghee
(1) Using the yeast, water and flour, follow the recipe for unleavened
bread below.  Add the seeds. (2) Divide the dough into four equal
parts. (3) Roll each part into a teardrop shape at least 1/4 inch
thick. (4) Preheat the grill to three-quarters heat, cover the rack
pan with foil, and set it in the midway position. (5) Put the naan on
the foil and grill it. Watch it cook (it can easily burn).  As soon
as the first side develops brown patches, remove it from the grill.
(6) Turn it over and brush the uncooked side with a little melted
ghee or butter. (7) Return it to the grill and cook it until it is
sizzling. Remove. (8) Repeat stages 5-8 with the other three naan.
Serve at once. LEAVENED BREAD: (1) Dissolve the fresh yeast in a
little lukewarm water. (2) Put the flour in a *warmed* bowl, make a
well in the center, and pour in the yeast. Yogurt can be used instead
of the yeast by non-vegans. (3) Gently mix into the flour and add
enough water to make a firm dough. (4) Remove from the bowl and knead
on a floured board until well combined.
Return to the bowl and leave in a warm place for a couple of hours to
rise. (5) Knock back the dough by kneading it down to its original
size.
