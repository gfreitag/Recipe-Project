Cookies:

Preheat oven to 300 F. In a medium bowl, combine flour, soda, salt,
cinnamon, ginger and allspice. Mix well with a wire whisk and set
aside. In a large bowl beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer
at medium speed til mixture forms a grainy paste. Scrape sides of
bowl, then add molasses and egg. Beat until light and fluffy. Add the
flour mixture and raisins, and blend at low speed just until
combined. Do not overmix.

Divide dough in half and shape each half roll into a roll 1 1/2
inches in diameter. Wrap rolls in waxed paper and refrigerate until
firm, about 2 hours. Slice cookies 1/2" thick and place on ungreased
cookie sheets, 1 1/2" apart. Bake for 25-27 minutes until cookies are
set. Immediately transfer cookies with a spatula to a cool surface
like your countertop.

To prepare the icing: Blend sugar and milk in a small bowl until
smooth. Using a small spoon or knife, drizzle cookies with icing.
