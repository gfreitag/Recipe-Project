Title: MERINGUE FOR PIES
Categories: Pies, Pastry
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Egg whites
1 ts Cream of tartar
1 pn Salt
6 tb Sugar
Beat the egg whites till they form soft peaks.  Add the cream of
tartar and salt and continue beating till the whites are stiff but
not dry. Add sugar, a little at a time, beating it in well. Spread
the meringue over the pie, being certain to cover the surface
completely, including the edge of the crust. If you are deft with the
pastry tube, you may pipe the meringue over the pie, using a #6
rosette tube. Bake the meringue at 350 degrees 15 to 18 minutes, or
until it is lightly browned. Note: The secret to keeping the meringue
from shrinking is to make sure there are no gaps between the pie
crust and the meringue.
