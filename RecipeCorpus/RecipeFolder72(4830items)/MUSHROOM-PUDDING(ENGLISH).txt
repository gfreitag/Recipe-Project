centre of the pudding, adding a little  stock or water.  Add the
dough lid, pressing the edges firmly together and sealing with a
little water. Tie a circle of greaseproof paper over the basin and
cover securely with kitchen foil. Place on a stand in a saucepan, and
pour round sufficient boiling water to come about half way up the
basin. Cover and boil for 2 to 2 1/2 hour's, topping up with boiling
water as necessary. Serve with potatoes and a green vegetable.
