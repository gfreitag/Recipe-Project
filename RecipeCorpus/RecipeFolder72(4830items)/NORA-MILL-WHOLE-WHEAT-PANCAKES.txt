Categories: Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  NORA MILL whole wheat pc mix
2 ea Eggs (3 for richer pancakes)
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk (milk is okay)

Beat eggs in a bowl until well mixed.  Add in buttermilk (or milk) and
butter.  Add mix and stir until dry ingredients are just moistened;
leave the batter a little lumpy. Bake pancakes on hot greased

before evaporating. Turn just once when pancakes begin to lose their
gloss and bubbles are starting to burst.
