Made with reduced-fat cream cheese and light sour cream, this
cheesecake is irresistible - just like its namesake cocktail.

FOR CRUST: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Spray
9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with vegetable oil
spray. Mix graham cracker crumbs and butter in medium bowl until
blended. Press crumbs over bottom and 1 inch up sides of prepared
pan. Refrigerate crust. FOR FILLING: Using electric mixer, beat
cheese in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in sour cream, then sugar,
triple sec, tequila and lime juice. Beat in eggs. Pour filling into
crust. Bake until outside 2 inches are set and center moves only
slightly when pan is shaken, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven; turn
off oven. FOR TOPPING: Whisk sour cream, lime juice and sugar in
small bowl to blend. Spread evenly over cheesecake. Return cheesecake
to hot oven. Let stand 45 minutes or less (Cheesecake will look very
soft, but will set up when chilled.) Refrigerate cake until well
chilled, up to 1 day. Run knife around pan sides. Remove pan sides.
Place cake on platter. Arrange lime half-slices and peel around top
edge of cheesecake.
