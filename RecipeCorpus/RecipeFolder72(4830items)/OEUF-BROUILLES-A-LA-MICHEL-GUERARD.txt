Title: OEUF BROUILLES A LA MICHEL GUERARD
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Breakfast
Yield: 2 Servings
4 lg Eggs
2 ts Butter
1 tb Creme fraiche
4 tb Finely chopped shallots
1 ts Finely chopped chives
Salt and pepper
2 oz Caviar
8    Long thin pieces of bread
- toasted
CUT EACH EGG SHELL about 1/2-inch from its pointed end with a serrated
knife (surgical scissors work well too). Pour out the insides into a
bowl. Wash the tops and shells in warm water, then turn them upside
down on a towel to dry completely. Over very low heat melt the butter
in a saucepan just large enough to hold the eggs. Beat the eggs with
a whisk, pour through a sieve into the warm butter and return to the
very low heat. Beat constantly with the whisk, gradually increasing
the heat, until the eggs are thick and creamy, but not solid. Remove
the eggs immediately from the heat and continue whisking while adding
the creme fraiche, shallots, chives, salt and pepper. Place the dried
eggshells in egg cups (or in a mound of coarse salt on a plate).
Using a teaspoon, carefully fill each shell 3/4 full with the creamed
eggs, then finish filling each shell with a tablespoon of caviar.
Replace the tops of the shells or garnish with some long stalks of
chives, if you wish. Serve with toast.
