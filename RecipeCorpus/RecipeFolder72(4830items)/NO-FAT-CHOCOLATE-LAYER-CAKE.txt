[They did *not* frost the sides. The sides of the cake layers show
the frosting, berries and jam oozing through.]

[Note: the picture on the cover showed the top layer being swirled
with the frosting, dottted with berries and then, dusted with cocoa
powder. This dusting of brown cocoa powder on the white frosting
looks delightful with the brown layers showing at the sides.]
