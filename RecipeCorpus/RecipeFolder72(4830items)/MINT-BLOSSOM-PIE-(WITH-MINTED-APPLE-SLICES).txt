Minted Apple Slices

Soften gelatine in cold water. Heat applesauce, sugar, salt, and
marshmallows over low heat, stirring frequently until marshmallows
melt. Remove from heat and add softened gelatine to hot mixture,
stirring until dissolved. Chill until partially congealed. Beat until
fluffy. Beat whipping cream until fluffy. Add lemon juice gradually
and beat until stiff. Fold into beaten gelatine mixture. Pour
one-half of mixture into baked pastry shell. Tint remaining filling
light green with few drops green food coloring and add peppermint
extract. Spoon green layer carefully over light layer. Chill until
congealed. Garnish top of pie with Minted Apple Slices. Serve.

Minted Apple Slices: Core and pare 2 medium firm apples. Cut each
into 8 or 10 slices. Combine 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon
peppermint extract, and few drops green food coloring in pan. Bring
to boil and add apple slices. Simmer until apples are transparent,
about 5 minutes, turning once. Cool in syrup. For a sophisticated
touch, add 2 tablespoons creme de menthe to the syrup as it cools.
Drain apples on absorbent paper. Arrange on pie.
