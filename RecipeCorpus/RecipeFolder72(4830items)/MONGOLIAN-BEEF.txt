+++++ Preparation:  Cut tops of green onions into 2" long pieces.
Combine sauce ingredients in small bowl & stir thoroughly. Cut steak
across the grain into thin slices, about 1/2" deep by 2" long. In
bowl big enough to hold meat, combine egg whites, salt & water
chestnut flour. Beat with chopstick until frothy. Add steak, & use
fingers to coat each slice. Deep-frying:  In wok, heat oil to
moderately hot. When ready, piece of coated meat will rise to surface
immediately. Fry meat in small batches; drop in 1 slice at a time to
avoid sticking. Cook until lightly brown, about 1 minute.  Drain on
Chinese strainer or paper bag. Stir-frying: Remove all but 2 T of oil
from wok. With wok at medium heat, quickly stir-fry green onions &
ginger for about 20 seconds. Add sauce; bring to boil on high heat
while stirring. Add beef all at once, & toss with sauce until beef is
hot & coated. Push beef out of sauce, dribble in cornstarch paste to
lightly thicken.  Recombine. Serve immediately.
