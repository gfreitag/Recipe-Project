Title: NORWEGIAN RYE BREAD
Categories: Breads, Abm, Good, Norwegian
Yield: 1 Loaf
2 1/2 ts Active yeast
1 2/3 c  Bread flour
1 3/4 c  Rye flour
5 tb Whole wheat flour
2 2/3 ts Caraway seeds
1/3 ts Salt
2 1/2 tb Margarine/butter
6 tb Molasses
1 c  Warm water (115 degree)
All ingredients except water must be at room temperature. Add
ingredients into the ABM as listed. Select white bread and start.

Notes: This is a dense loaf and rises less than other loafs. I have
added an extra 1/4 of water to increase size. Great to snacks or as a
sandwich
