Title: MIKE'S BEEF JERKY
Categories: Beef, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb London Broil
1/2 c  Soy sauce
2 tb Worstershire sauce
2 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Onion powder
2 ts Fresly ground black pepper
2 ts Red pepper flakes, less for
-sissies
2 tb Liquid smoke
Freeze the London Broil or other lean roast.  When ready to make
jerky, remove the roast from the freezer and let partially thaw. When
just able to slice, first remove all fat and then slice against the
grain in thin (1/4 inch or less) slices. Cover the meat with the
marinade, turn from time to time and let marinade overnight.  In the
morning line a shallow cookie sheet with a few layers of paper
towels.  Place on lower rack. Place upper rack in oven in top
position and lower rack in lower position. Hang the beef slices from
the upper rack with tooth picks above the paper towels. I find about
6 hours at 160F average temp is about right.

If your oven is real tight, you might crack open the door a bit to
allow the water vapor to escape.
