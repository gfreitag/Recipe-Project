Title: MOM'S PIEROGI DOUGH
Categories: Polish, Main dish, Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Flour
1/2 c  Milk, warm
OR
1/2 c  Water
1    Egg
1    Egg Yolk
2 tb Sour cream
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Butter (Optional)
Mix all ingredients and knead into a soft, pliable dough.  Let rest
for 10 minutes, covered in a warm bowl.  The kneading should only be
about 15 or 20 minutes.  We haven't used a pasta maker on this, but
that should work.

Divide dough in half.  Roll thing, about 1/8 inch.  Cut into 2 inch
squares or use a large round biscuit cutter.  Take a piece and
stretch lightly. Place a small spoonfull of filling in it.  Fold
dough over and carefully seal the edges.  A bit of water on the edge
helps make a good seal.

Place completed pierogis in salted boiling water.  Cook for about 5
minutes, or until they float.  Remove gently with a slotted spoon.

Place in a pan with melted butter and onions.  Allow to brown, if you
want. They are good either way.

They are great the first day.  Even better if you have some left over
the following day, either cold or re-fried.  I like them best the
second day when they are browned.
