Title: MELTING VEGETABLE KEBABS
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
750 g  Mixed vegetables*
3 tb Olive oil
1 tb Dried mixed herbs
75 g  Mozzarella, sliced
Salt and pepper
*(e.g. mushrooms, courgettes, tomatoes, celery, shallots, aubergine,
cauliflower, mange-tout, etc.)

Serves 2-3

Crunchy vegetable kebabs make an eye-catching main course, and the
final coating of melting mozzarella is quite mouthwatering. Serve
them on a bed of rice, with a sauce of your choice (see Sauces).

Slice all the vegetables to bite size and skewer them alternately on
to kebab sticks. Brush liberally with olive oil and sprinkle with
dried mixed herbs, salt and pepper. Grill under a moderate heat for
10-12 minutes, turning, until the vegetables are cooked through but
still slightly crisp. Then finally cover them with slices of
mozzarella and brown under the grill. Serve at once.
