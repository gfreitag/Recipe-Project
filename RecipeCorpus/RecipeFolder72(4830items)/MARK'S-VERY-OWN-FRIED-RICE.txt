Title: MARK'S VERY OWN FRIED RICE
Categories: Rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Cooked rice
1 lg Onion, finely chopped
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1 lg Carrot, scrubbed & diced
1 md Green pepper, diced
1/2 c  Frozen corn &/or peas
1 ea 3" piece ginger root, sliced
1/2 ts Chili pieces
Soy sauce
Salt & pepper, to taste
Ensure that the rice has been cooked ahead of time & is well cooled.

Heat about 2 to 3 tb vegetable oil in a wok.  When hot, add onions &
garlic & fry for 3 minutes.  Add the carrots & stir-fry for 2
minutes. Add the rest of the vegetables & continue to stir-fry for 2
or 3 minutes. Toss in the chili pieces & ginger root.  Cook for a few
seconds. Carefully stir in the cold rice.  Lower heat & continue to
cook, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes.  Add enough soy sauce to
coat the rice & cook for a further 5 minutes on low heat, stirring
often to prevent sticking. Season if desired with salt & pepper.
Serve when heated through.

This goes great with spicy tofu dishes or works well on its own as a
main dish in its own right.

If you desire something hotter, add more chili pieces. Use pieces
rather than powder because they are hotter.

For a variation, I sometimes toss in a few strips of tofu just before
adding the spices.
