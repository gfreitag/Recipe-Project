Title: NEVER-FAIL PIE CRUST
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Crisco or other GOOD
Shortening
1/2 c  Boiling water
Pinch of salt
3 c  Flour.
Mix shortening, salt and boiling water in a large bowl. Whip with a
fork until fluffy.  Add the flour all at once. Stir until it leaves
the side of the bowl. Roll between two sheets of wax paper. Makes
enough for a two-crust pie.  If using for two one-crust pies, bake at
375 10-12 minutes or until light brown before adding filling.

This also freezes well if made up ahead, if you like to have pie
shells on hand for one-crust pies.
