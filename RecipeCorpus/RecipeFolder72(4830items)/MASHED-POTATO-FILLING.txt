The recipe is from a cookbook I have on Amish and Mennonite cooking.
It calls for a pinch of saffron but because of the astronomic cost of
this spice I have always omitted it when making this recipe. Hope
it's similar to what you're looking for! 1.  Melt butter. Add celery
and onion. Cook until tender.  Pour over bread cubes and mix well.
2.Combine saffron(if using) and boiling water. Add to bread and mix
well. Add remaining ingredients to bread, mixing well after each
addition. Finished product should be very moist.  Add more milk if
necessary. 3. Turn into 2 well greased casserole dishes. Bake at 350
for 45 minutes. Note: I use one 9x13 pan instead of two smaller
casseroles.
