Cook the millet in the water for about 45 minutes and cool. Preheat
the oven to 350F. Gently stir the sweetener and salt into the millet
and spread half the mixture in an oiled 9" x 9" square pan. Sprinkle
1/4 - 1/2 cup of nuts over it and bake for 10 minutes. Let cool.

While the millet is cooking, combine the fruit filling ingredients
in a saucepan, bring to a low boil, then simmer on low to medium heat
for 30-45 minutes or until the fruit can be stirred easily into a
mushy fruit spread. Allow to cool completely.

Use most of the fruit mixture (depending on how sweet you would
like the squares to be) and spread it over the first layer of baked
millet. Sprinkle on more ground nuts if desired. Add the last of the
cooled millet mixture and spread it evenly over the fruit. Add
additional ground nuts or seeds if desired. Bake for about 20 minutes
more at 350F until somewhat drier and firm. Cool completely and chill
to help set the squares.

Serve at room temperature. Keeps 6-8 days refrigerated. Great for
lunches and snacks too. Some prefer this as a dessert, as is, or with
1/4 cup or more powdered natural sweetener added to the millet.

If a sweeter dessert is desired add extra powdered natural sweetener
to the millet mixture. MAKES: 8-14
