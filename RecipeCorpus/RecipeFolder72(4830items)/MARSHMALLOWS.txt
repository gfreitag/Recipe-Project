~=> Vanilla Sugar (Granulated or Powdered) Simply bury one, two or
even more vanilla beans in a jar of sugar and cover it with a tight
lid. If you want to the beans to flavor the sugar more quickly, cut
them lengthwise with kitchen shears.  do this over the container of
sugar so the tiny seeds ~ source of much of the flavor - will land
where they belong.
