To taste (opt)
This is the good part. Saute onions and garlic in water till starting
to turn yellow, add all other ingredients in a large pot with 2 1/2
cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer an hour (or
until peas are tender) and then puree in a blender. That's it!

Serve as a main meal with whole wheat pita bread. For a variation,
sprinkle fresh ripe diced tomato on top of soup (or this can be
blended in earlier). For those who remember the days when pea soup
used to have h*m or b*c*n in it, soy baco-bits, sprinkled in just
before serving, brings back that aura.
