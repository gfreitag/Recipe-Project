Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1    2 Lb Beef Fillet
1    Recipe; marinade for beef
1    Recipe; French lining pastry
1/4 lb Mushrooms; fresh, sliced
1    Recipe; Anglais glaze
Trim any gristle and surplus fat from the fillet, then place in a
medium-sized bowl. Pour the marinade over the fillet and cover the
bowl with plastic wrap. Marinate the fillet for about 4 hours, turning
occasionally. Remove the fillet from the marinade and drain well.
Roll out the pastry on a well-floured board to 1/8 inch thickness.
Cut into a rectangle wide enough to overlap the fillet by 1 1/2
inches and long enough to cover the ends well. Place the pastry
rectangle carefully over a shallow baking dish. arrange half the
mushrooms length-wise down the center of the pastry, then place
fillet over the mushrooms. Arrange the remaining mushrooms over the
fillet. Wrap, glaze, then decorate the fillet for baking according to
the step by step instructions. Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven
for about 40 minutes for a medium rare fillet or 50 minutes for a
medium doneness. Serve immediately. STEP BY STEP DIRECTIONS:
#1.Wrapping the fillet; Lift one long side of the pastry over the
fillet and brush the edge with cold water. Lift the opposite side
over the top of the pastry and press gently to seal. #2. Wet the
short ends and press together sealing well. Trim off the excess
pastry. #3. Brush the wrapped fillet with Anglais glaze. #4. Cut the
pastry trimmings into decorative rounds, crescents or into 3/8 inch
strips for braiding. Place over the seam on the top of the pastry.
Brush the trim with glaze. Any unused trim may be glazed and baked
separately until golden brown. This recipe requires three additional
recipes that I am posting with this outline. The recipes required
are; Mike Stock Marinade for Beef, Mike Stock french lining pastry,
and Mike Stock Angais Glaze.
