PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F with rack in lower area of oven. Oil a round
pizza pan, preferably black steel; sprinkle lightly with cornmeal.
Set aside. Roll dough into circle, roughly 11 inches in diameter,
letting dough relax a few minutes if it keeps withdrawing. Place in
prepared pan, gently stretching it back to size once it's in the pan.
Prick dough with fork. Heat oil in 7-inch skillet over medium high
heat. Remove casing from sausage; crumble meat into 1/2-inch chunks.
When oil is hot, add sausage, garlic and onion to pan. Cook until
onion is softened, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Spread mixture on
dough leaving 1/2-inch margin. Sprinkle 1/2 cheese over. Bake for 12
minutes. Sprinkle remaining cheese over. Bake until this cheese has
melted and dough is deeply browned, about 3 minutes more. Remove from
oven. Sprinkle with minced cilantro and green onions. Cut into
wedges. Garnish each wedge with drained salsa and cilantro leaves.
Serve hot.
