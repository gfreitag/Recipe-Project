Title: NUTTY RICE BURGERS
Categories: Main dish, Rice, Nuts, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Boiling water
1 c  Bulgur
1/4 c  Vegetable stock
1/2 c  Onions, finely chopped
1/2 c  Carrots, shredded
1/2 c  Zucchini, shredded
1 ts Thyme
3 c  Brown rice, cooked
1/2 c  Liquid egg substitute
1/2 c  Wholewheat flour
1/4 c  Walnuts, finely chopped
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Rosemary
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 tb Oil
Combine boiling water & the bulgur.  Cover & set aside until bulgur is
soft, about 20 minutes.  Drain well, pressing to remove as much
moisture as possible.  Set aside.

In a large skillet, heat broth.  Add the prepared vegetables plus the
thyme & cook until the vegetables are tender & the liquid has
evaporated. This should take about 5 minutes. Add to the waiting
bulgur.

Stir in the rest of the ingredients with the exception of the oil. Mix
until all ingredients are well combined. Shape into 6 patties, adding
more flour if necessary to hold them together.

Warm the oil in a large skillet over medium heat & saute prepared
patties until golden on both sides.

Serve in wholewheat pita breads with slices of tomato & onion.
