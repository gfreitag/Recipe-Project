Title: NON / FLAT ONION BREADS (CENTRAL ASIA)
Categories: Breads, Dumplings
Yield: 16 Servings
6 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Onions -- finely chopped
3/4 c  Water -- lukewarm
1 ts Salt
3 c  All-purpose flour
Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet set
over high heat.  Add the onions, reduce the heat to low and, stirring
occasionally, cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft but
not brown.  Transfer them to a bowl and cool to room temperature.

Melt the remaining butter in the skillet and pour it into a large
bowl. Add the lukewarm (110 - 115 F) water and, with a large spoon,
stir in the chopped onions, salt and 2 1/2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at
a time. If necessary, beat in as much of the remaining 1/2 cup of the
flour as you need to make a dough that does not stick to your
fingers. Gather the dough into a large, compact ball and divide it
into 16 pieces. With the palms of your hands, shape each piece of
dough into a 1 1/2 to 2 inch ball. Then, with a lightly floured
rolling pin, roll out the balls one at a time into circles that are
about 8 inches in diameter. Set the rounds of dough aside.

Set a heavy 10- to 12-inch ungreased pan over high heat. When it is
hot enough for a drop of water flicked across its surface to instantly
evaporate, place one round of dough in the center. Brown for 3 or 4
minutes on each side, turning it over with your fingers or a wide
spatula; do not be concerned if the bread does not brown evenly.

Transfer the bread to a rack to dry and proceed to fry and dry the
remaining dough similarly.  Serve the bread in a basket or other
porous container.  If for any reason the bread becomes limp after a
day or so, place the rounds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and
bake them for 5 to 10 minutes in a preheated 250F oven until they
freshen.
