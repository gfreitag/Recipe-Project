Title: NON-FAT BERRY YOGURT
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 qt Non-fat milk
1/4 c  Plain yogurt at room temp
berries in season

(to provide live cultures-make sure the yogurt says so, or you can
buy live yogurt cultures from any health food store)

Heat milk to just below boiling (120 degrees) using a candy
thermometer.

Allow milk to cool till tepid (90 degrees).  Stir in yogurt. Mix till
blended with milk.  Turn into glass bowl or 4 containers with fresh
berries.  Cover and keep barely lukewarm. Let container stand
undisturbed.

Remove when curd has formed.  Store in fridge. (in my yogurt maker, it
takes about 8 - 10 hours)
