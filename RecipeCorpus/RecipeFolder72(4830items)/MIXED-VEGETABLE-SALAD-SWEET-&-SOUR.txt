MMMMM------------------SWEET AND SOUR DRESSING-----------------------
1    Garlic clove
1/2 sm Onion; finely sliced
2 tb Honey
3 tb Tarragon vinegar
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Mustard
1 ts Snipped chives
1 ts Snipped dill
1 ts Parsley; finely chopped
150 ml Vegetable oil
Salt; to taste
Serves 3-4

To prepare the dressing, put the garlic, onion, honey and vinegar
into the blender. Add the lemon juice and mustard, and salt to taste.
With the blade working, add the oil in a thin stream and blend the
dressing until it thickens. Put it into a jar and leave it to stand
overnight for the flavours to amalgamate. Strain the dressing into a
jug, and stir in the chives, dill and parsley.

Arrange the shredded cabbage in the centre of a serving-platter and
toss it in half of the dressing. Arrange the French beans, artichokes
and corn decoratively around the cabbage. Serve the remaining
dressing in a sauce boat.
