Title: MICROWAVE TIPS - LASAGNE
Categories: Info, Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings  A trick I learned while working as a microwave oven demonstrator is
that cooked lasagne noodles may be replaced by layering flour
tortillas and thinly sliced Monterey Jack cheese.

I've found the most convenient way to do this is to slice the tor-
tillas into 1.5" to 2" strips and placing the jack cheese evenly on
top. Layer as you would the cooked noodles. While cooking, the two
blend together. The result is indistinguishable from using cooked
noodles except that you will experience an extra richness. If the
recipe you're using is very simple you may even find the results to
be better than using the actual noodles since it does add a very
desirable richness and texture.

I do not recommend that you use this method in a conventional oven.
I've tried it and the tortilla/cheese combination seemed to turn to
mush and lose its definition. Submitted by Lawren Freebody @ Salata
