*To eliminate oil from this recipe, saute the mushrooms in the tamari
or a bit of the water instead. Saute the mushrooms in the oil. Add
the flour and constantly over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes to
brown the flour for more flavour. Add the remaining ingredients and
stir with a wine whisk until the sauce is very well mixed and there
are no lumps. Stir constantly over medium heat until very hot. Reduce
heat and cook on the lowest setting for 10-15 minutes until the sauce
is thickened. Stir occasionally while simmering. Serve over hot
