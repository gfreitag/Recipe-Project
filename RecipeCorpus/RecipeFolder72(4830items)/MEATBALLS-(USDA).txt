Title: MEATBALLS (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
2 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
1 lb Lean ground pork
5 lg Eggs -- beaten
1/4 c  Instant minced onion
1 2/3 c  Fine dry breadcrumbs
3 tb Cornstarch
4 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1 tb Sage
2 c  Milk
Mix all ingredients well.  Shape into 48 balls, about
1 3/4    inches in diameter.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Place
meatballs in a shallow baking pan. Bake 30 minutes or until meat is
done. Serve with Mushroom Sauce.

TO FREEZE:  Place 12 balls in single layer on freezer wrap. Allow
enough extra wrap to fold over top. Complete wrapping by pulling
paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold
several times so paper lies directly on top of food.  Fold ends of
freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer tape. Label with name
of food, date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for
best eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12
hours before stacking packages.

TO BAKE FROZEN MEATBALLS:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place meatballs in a shallow baking pan. Bake 1 hour or
until meat is done. Serve with Mushroom Sauce.
