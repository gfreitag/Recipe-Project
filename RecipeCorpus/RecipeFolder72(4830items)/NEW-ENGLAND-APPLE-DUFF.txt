A duff of apples, such as this one, is far lighter than the orignal
and more of a souffle-like pudding. It is best served as soon as it
comes out of the oven.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart casserole.

Cut the apples into eighths and place in a large saucepan. Combine the
cider, tapioca, and 1 cup sugar, and stir until sugar is disolved;
pour over the apples. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 10
to 12 minutes, until apples are soft but not mushy. Turn into the
prepared casserole.

In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with a dash of salt and 6 tablespoons
sugar; set aside. Beat the egg whites with another dash of salt,
until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and whisk until stiff but not
dry. Fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. Add the vanilla,
and fold in the flour and almond extract. Pour batter over the apples
and bake 35 to 45 minutes, or untill puffed and golden brown.
