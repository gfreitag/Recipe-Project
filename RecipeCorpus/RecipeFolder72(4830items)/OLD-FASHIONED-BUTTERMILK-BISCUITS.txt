Title: OLD FASHIONED BUTTERMILK BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Cake flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Cold unsalted butter
34 c  Buttermilk or more
Preheat the oven to 450F; set rack in middle level. Prepare biscuit
dough. COMBINE THE FLOURS, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl
and stir well to mix. Rub in the butter by hand or with a pastry
blender until the mixture is mealy. Stir in 3/4 cup of the buttermilk
with a fork and continue stirring gently until the dough begins to
hold together. (If the dough is dry, add more buttermilk, 1
tablespoon at a time.) Sprinkle the work surface generously with
flour and scrape the dough onto it. Fold the dough over on itself two
or three times. Use the dough immediately . Pat dough into a 6-by-12-
inch rectangle and cut into eight 3-inch biscuits with a sharp,
floured knife. Transfer to a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Paint tops
with buttermilk. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until well risen and
golden.
