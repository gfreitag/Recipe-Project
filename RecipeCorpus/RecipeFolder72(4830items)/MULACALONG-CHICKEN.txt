Title: MULACALONG CHICKEN
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1    3-4 lb chicken, cut up
2    Onions, chopped
1    Dried red pepper -or-
1/2 ts Cayenne
-salt & pepper to taste
1    Red bell pepper, julienned
4 tb Oil
2 c  Chicken broth
2 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Coriander
1    Lemon
1    Ear fresh corn
Cut chicken in 6 to 8 pieces, wash and pat dry with paper towels.
Brown chicken in oil until golden on all sides. Remove chicken from
pan and reserve. Brown chopped onions lightly in the same oil. Return
chicken to the pan with stock and seasonings. Grate lemon rind and
reserve. Squeeze lemon and add juice to the stock. Bring stock to a
simmer and add the bell pepper strips.  Cut kernals from the ear of
corn and puree in a blender, add to the stock, cover pan, and simmer
for 8 minutes. Turn the chicken breasts and simmer until tender
(about 5 minutes). Remove cooked breasts to a serving platter and
keep warm while the other pieces finish cooking 15 to 20 minutes.
[COOKS NOTE: Use your judgement here. I find it is usually the backs
that I remove first, not the breasts] Transfer remaining chicken to
the serving platter and reduce stock rapidly over high heat. Pour
sauce over chicken and sprinkle with the reserved lemon rind. I serve
over a bed of rice so we don't waste any of the sauce
