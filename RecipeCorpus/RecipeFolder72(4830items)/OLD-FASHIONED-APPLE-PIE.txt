In saucepan, bring cider to boil and reduce to about
1/2    cup. Cool about 20 minutes.

Crust: mix together cider and water. In processor, mix together flour
and butter. Pulse off and on until coarse crumbs form. With motor
running, add water-cider mixture. Process just until dough leaves
side of bowl. Gather dough into a ball. Divide in half. Flatten each
into a disk & wrap in plastic wrap. Chill about 30-45 minutes.
Filling: in bowl, mix together sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add
apples to sugar mixture and toss to coat well. Sprinkle reduced apple
cider over all and toss to coat well. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
On lightly floured surface, roll out half of dough to a 12 inch
circle. Place in 9 inch pie plate. Spoon apple mixture into pie
shell, mounding high in center. Roll remaining dough into 12 inch
circle. Place over filling. Press edges together and roll up together
to form an even rim. Flute decoratively. Brush top of pastry with
water and sprinkle over all with 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar. Cut slits
in top of pie for steam to escape. Place pie on baking sheet and bake
30 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake
45 minutes or until crust is golden brown and apples are bubbly. (if
top crust begins to brown too quickly, cover loosely with a piece of
foil.) Cool on wire rack. Serve warm.
