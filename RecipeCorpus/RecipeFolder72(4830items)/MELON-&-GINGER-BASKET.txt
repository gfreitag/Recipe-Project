Cut a thin slice off one of rounded sides of melon (not pointed
ends), so melon will sit level on a serving plate.

To form a handle, make 2 cuts about 3/4" wide on either side of a
central strip. Continue cutting halfway down melon, then cut from
bottom of handle around either side of fruit so these two wedges can
be lifted away to form a basket shape. Cut away flesh from inside
handle. Remove seeds from melon. Scoop out balls with a small melon
scoop or cut flesh in pieces and place in a bowl. Smooth edge of
melon basket.

Add orange juice, stem ginger and syrup and nutmeg to melon balls and
stir lightly. Add kiwifruit, lychees, strawberries and grapes and mix
lightly. Spoon mixture into melon and arrange fruits attractively.
Cover and chill. Garnish with mint sprig, if desired, and serve with
ice cream.

VARIATION: Use fresh fruits such as cherries, pineapple, peaches,
figs and nectarines. Substitute freshly squeezed lime juice for
orange juice.
