Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Baking soda
3 tb Solid veg. shortening
-or unsalted margarine
3/4 c  Buttermilk OR 1 CUP HEAVY
-CREAM
1 c  All purpose flour, for
-shaping biscuits
2 tb Butter or margarine, melted
1. Heat oven to 475 degrees. Spray an 8" baking pan with cooking
spray. 2. In a medium sized bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder,
salt, and baking soda until blended. Cut in shortening with pastry
blender, or work it in with fingertips until lumps are no larger than
small peas. 3. Stir in buttermilk ( or cream) and let stand for 2-3
min. dough is very wet. 4. Pour remaining 1 cup all-purpose flour
onto a plate. Flour hands well. Scoop up about 2 Tbsp. dough and
scrape it onto the flour. Sprinkle more flour onto the dough. Gently
pick up clump of dough and shape into a soft round by passing it from
hand to hand, shaking off excess flour. Place in middle of prepared
pan. Shape 9 more biscuits this way. 5. Brush tops with melted
butter. Bake 16-18 min or until tops are evenly brown.

These are the best biscuits I ever made!  PLEASE MAKE THEM FIRST WITH
THE HEAVY CREAM.  IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN MAKING THEM WITH BUTTERMILK!
