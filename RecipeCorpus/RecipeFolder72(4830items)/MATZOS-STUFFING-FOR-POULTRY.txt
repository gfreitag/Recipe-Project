Meanwhile, squeeze excess water from the matzos and mix together the
matzos, half a teaspoon salt, 6 soaked, pitted and chopped prunes, a
dash of cinnamon, quarter of a cup of slivered almonds, and 2 eggs.
Mix well then turn into the pan of fried onions. Stir over moderate

Let cool a little then add 1 tablespoon chopped parsley. Use mixture
to stuff a large chicken and roast as usual.
