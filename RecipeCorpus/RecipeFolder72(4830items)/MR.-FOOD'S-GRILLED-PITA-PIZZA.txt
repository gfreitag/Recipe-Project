Title: MR. FOOD'S GRILLED PITA PIZZA
Categories: Sandwiches, Pita
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lg (about 8 inches) pitas
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1 1/3 c  Salsa, divided
8 oz Shredded Monterey Jack
- cheese, divided
2 1/4 oz Sliced black olives,
- drained, divided
4 oz Chopped green chilies,
- drained, divided
======================================================= ======
Preheat the grill to medium heat. Brush one side of each pita with
the oil. Place the pitas on a disposable aluminum baking pan and top
each one with the salsa, cheese, olives, and chilies, dividing
evenly. Place the pan on the grill, close the grill cove NOTE: I
usually use medium-hot salsa, but go with a milder or hotter one if
you prefer.
