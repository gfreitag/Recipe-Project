1 Because the dough has a tendency to drip as it bakes, I usually put
a cookie sheet or aluminum foil underneath the Bundt pan. That way I
don't have to clean up a mess in the oven when the bread has finished
baking. -- Rita M. Newton, Waukon, Iowa

2 Thaw dough in refrigerator for 12 hours. Combine 1 cup sugar and
the next 4 ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, and cook
1 minute. Remove sugar syrup from heat; let cool 10 minutes.

3 Cut each loaf of dough into 24 equal portions. Combine 1/4 cup
sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow dish; stir well. Roll
each portion in sugar mixture, and layer dough in a 12-cup Bundt pan
coated with cooking spray. Pour sugar syrup over dough; cover and let
rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 35 minutes or
until doubled in bulk.

4 Uncover, and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until lightly
browned. Immediately loosen edges of bread with a knife. Place a
serving plate, upside down, on top of the pan, and invert bread onto
the plate. Remove the pan, and drizzle any remaining syrup over the
bread.
