In  food processor or blender, puree strawberries. Pour 1 cup puree

In  1 quart saucepan, mix gelatin, sugar and salt. Add water; cook
over low heat until gelatin  is completely dissolved, stirring often.
Into puree in small bowl, stir 2 tablespoons of gelatin mixture. Into
puree in large bowl, stir  lemon  juice, vanilla, and remaining
gelatin mixture. Refrigerate  mixtures, stirring often, until
mixtures mound when dropped from spoon(about 45 minutes).

In small bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat egg whites until stiff
peaks form. In large bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat cream
until stiff peaks form. Using a spatula, gently fold egg whites and
cream into strawberry mixture in the large bowl.

Alternately  spoon  strawberry mixtures from  large and small bowls
into prepared souffle dish. Cut through mixtures with knife to make
marbled design, then cover and refrigerate until mousse is set(about
3    hours).
