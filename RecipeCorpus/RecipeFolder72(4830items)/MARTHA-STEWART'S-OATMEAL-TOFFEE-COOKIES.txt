Martha Stewart always thought it would be difficult to improve on her
own oatmeal cookie recipe until she tasted Torie Hallock 92s
exquisite oatmeal cookies filled with toffee pieces, chocolate
chunks, and dried cherries. An outstanding baker and cook, Torie
lives in rural Maine and still manages to locate the finest and most
delicious ingredients to use in her cooking.

Torie 92s oatmeal-cookie dough can be baked immediately, refrigerated
for 1-2 days, and frozen for up to a month.

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together the flour and baking soda
and set aside. In an electric mixer, using a paddle attachment cream
the butter and sugars on medium high speed until light and fluffy,
about 2 to 3 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl one or twice
during mixing. Add egg; mix on high speed to combine. Add vanilla
extract; mix to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

2. Add the sifted flour in additions on a low speed until well
combined. On low speed, add the oatmeal, cherries, chocolate and
toffee pieces and mix to combine.

3. Divide the dough into three equal portions and roll into logs using
plastic wrap, approximately 1 1/2-inch in diameter. Dough can be
frozen, chilled in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days or baked
immediately. Cut logs into 3/4-inch pieces. Bake on parchment-lined
baking sheets, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the
oven, and transfer to a baking rack to cool.
