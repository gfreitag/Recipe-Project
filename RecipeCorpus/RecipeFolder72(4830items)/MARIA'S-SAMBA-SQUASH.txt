Winter squash - acorn or butternut - is an exciting substitute for the
unusual baked or mashed potatoes. The bite of ginger spices squash up
perfectly. For a sweeter taste, add cinnamon, nutmeg and mace along
with the ginger. My Jamaican friend, Maria, shared her easy,
delicious recipe with us.

1. Place squash and carrots in a large, heavy pot and cover with
salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until
tender, 15-20 minutes. Drain well and remove to a bowl.

2. Coarsely mash vegetables along with the butter and ginger. Season
generously with salt and pepper.

NOTE: Butternut squash can be diffucult to cut, because the pulp is
very firm and the outer skin is slightly tough, so work carefully.
Cut the squash in half crosswise at the base of the large neck. Then
carefully cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out any seeds in the cavity
and slice the halves into 1" lengths crosswise. Peel the skin from
each piece and continue with recipe.
