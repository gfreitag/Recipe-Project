Title: NUTTY RICE LOAF
Categories: Low-cal, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
Nonstick vegetable spray
1 1/2 c  Cooked brown rice
1 c  Zucchini shredded
1/4 c  Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Wheat germ
1/4 c  Walnuts, chopped
1 c  Med. cheddar cheese shredded
3    Eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/4 ts Black pepper
My notes:  Omit wheat germ for gluten-free diet. Substitute bran if
wheat germ is not available, used to add fiber.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Spray 9 x 5 inch loaf pan with non-stick
vegetable spray.  Combine ingredients and pack into loaf pan.

Bake 40 - 45 minutes or until brown on edges and firm to touch. Cut
into slices.  Serve hot or at room temperature with a salad.

OR Microwave in glass loaf pan covered with wax paper for 8 minutes
on high power.  Rotate once.  OR if mixture holds together well
enough, shape into patties and brown in a non-stick frying pan.
