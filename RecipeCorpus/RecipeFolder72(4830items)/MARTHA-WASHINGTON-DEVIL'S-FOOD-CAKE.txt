Martha Washington Devil's Food Cake (from Baker's Book of Chocolate
Riches)

Melt  chocolate  in a saucepan over a very low  heat, stirring
constantly until smooth.  Add 1/2 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup of the
buttermilk. Stir until well blended. Cool thoroughly. Mik flour,
baking powder, soda and salt.  Cream  butter,  and gradualy beat in
the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar. Continue beating until light and
fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each. Blend
in about one-fourth of the flour mixture, then add the chocolate &
vanilla. Alternately add the remaining flour and buttermilk, beating
after each addition until smooth.

Pour  into two 9 inch greased & floured pans, and bake at 350 for
about 40 minutes.

I  used a cream cheese frosting on the outside and filled the space
between the layers with the chocolate frosting recipe on the
Hershey's cocoa box.
