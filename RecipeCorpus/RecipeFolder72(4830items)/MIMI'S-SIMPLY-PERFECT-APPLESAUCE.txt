Title: MIMI'S SIMPLY PERFECT APPLESAUCE
Categories: Magazine, Fruits, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Apples; preferably MacIntosh
1    Lemon peel strip; 2 inches
1/2 c  - to 2 cups water; as needed
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla extract
Heavy cream as garnish
1. Core and quarter apples, but do not peel. Cook with lemon peel in
large, heavy-bottomed saucepan with just enough water to cover bottom
of pan. Cover and simmer gently for about 15 minutes, or until apple
pieces are soft but not quite falling apart. If water evaporates, add
a little more, but the less the better.

2. Puree apples through food mill or strainer set over clean pot.
Discard lemon and apple peels. Set pot of puree over low heat, and
stir in sugar and cinnamon, but not vanilla. Simmer, stirnng
frequently, until applesauce is very thick-about 10 minutes. Adjust
flavor, adding vanilla.

3. Serve hot, warm, or cold. A trickle of cold sweet cream is a
delicious topping, especially on hot applesauce.
