Categories: Pasta, Main dish, Meatless
Yield: 10 Servings
9    Pieces Lasagne; uncooked
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 lg Onion; finely diced
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 lb Eggplant
-- peeled and finely diced
3 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese
4 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
1 c  Plain, low-fat yogurt

1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Cook lasagne according to package directions; drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Warm oil in a large saucepan over low
heat. Add onion, garlic and eggplant. Cover and let vegetables cook
until very soft, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the
ricotta, feta and yogurt. When vegetables are done, stir in tomato
sauce. Remove from heat and set aside 1 cup of eggplant mixture.

In a 9 x 13 x 2-inch baking dish, spread a little of the eggplant
mixture over the bottom and cover with 3 pieces of lasagne. Spoon
some of the ricotta over the lasagne. Continue to layer with eggplant
mixture, lasagne, and ricotta. Place a layer of lasagne on top.
Spread the reserved eggplant over lasagne and sprinkle with Parmesan.
Bake uncovered for 45 minutes, until cheese is brown.
