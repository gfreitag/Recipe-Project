Title: MINIATURE POTATO CUTLETS
Categories: Try it, Pileggi, Ovo-lacto
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------
~Jewish, Afghanistan
6 lb Potatoes ~ water
2    Eggs, beaten
1 c  Fine matzoh meal
1 ts Salt, or to taste
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Ground cuminseed
1/2 c  Corn oil

1.  Cover the potatoes with water in a pan and cook them in their
skins, covered, until tender.  Cool and peel the potatoes and puree
them in a processor.  Add the eggs, matzoh meal, salt, pepper, and
cuminseed and mix well.

2.  Prepare small football-shaped cutlets 1" long and 1/2" wide. Heat
the oil in a skillet and brown the cutlets, a few at a time, over
moderate heat. Drain them on paper towels.

Serve warm.  Serves 6.

Potatoes are often the filler needed during Passover when bread is
abolished for the holiday.  These small "footballs" of simple but
satisfying ingredients can be served during a meal, although I have
also served them with drinks as appetizers.
