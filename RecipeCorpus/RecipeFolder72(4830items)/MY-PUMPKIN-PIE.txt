Title: MY PUMPKIN PIE
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Browned, strained pumpkin
3 tb All purpose flour
1 c  Brown sugar
2 c  Milk
1 c  Cream *
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Nutmeg
2    Eggs, beaten
1    Pie dough for 2 pies
2 tb Sugar
1    Ginger
*  Recipe calls for heavy cream if possible, I prefer 2% canned milk.

This recipe calls for browned pumpkin which is accomplished by
buttering a heavy cast iron frying pan and cooking the 2 cups pumpkin
over medium heat, stirring and turning so all parts dry properly.
Keep this up til it is reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  It will be slightly
browned.

Place the browned pumpkin in a bowl, sprinkle with 2 tbsp of the
flour and brown sugar and stir til thoroughly mixed. Scald milk. Add
the cream, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.  Pour over pumpkin mixture.
Mix and add the eggs.  Beat together til well mixed. Line pie plates
with dough, well built up around edges. Mix together the 2 tbsp sugar
the remaining tbsp of flour and the pinch of spice. Sprinkle over
bottom pie crusts, spreading all over with tips of fingers. This
prevents sogginess. Fill shell 3/4 full. Place strips of foil around
edge and place in a preheated 450 oven. Bake for 15 minutes and
reduce the heat to 325. Bake 30 minutes longer. Pie is done when the
mixture shakes just in the middle when moved back and forth. Serve
hot or cold.
