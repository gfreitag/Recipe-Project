Yield: 4 Servings
Egg noodles
Parsley
1/2 c  Butter
MSG
Salt, to taste
Pepper, freshly ground
Sour cream
Parmesan cheese, grated

Garlic cloves, pressed
Cook the noodles; reserve.  Melt butter in a large saucepan. In the
blender, liquefy "3 to 4 times as much parsley as you'd think you'd
need" with "the least amount of water possible." Add to melted butter
with salt, MSG and "plenty" of black pepper.  Add sour cream until
good sauce, about a cup; blend.  (Don't heat sour cream too much
because it might curdle.) Add grated cheese(s) and pressed garlic,
then noodles.
