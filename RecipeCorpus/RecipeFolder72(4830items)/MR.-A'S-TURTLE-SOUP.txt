Categories: Soups, Turtle, Game
Yield: 6 Servings
15    To 20 lbs. fresh or frozen
-turtle meat
6    Carrots
4    Onions
1    Stalk celery, diced fine
1/2    Gal. Burgundy
4    To 5 gals. Povirade sauce
1 lb Gelatin
Stock pot:
1 tb Marjoram
2 ts Gumbo file
1 ts Coriander
6    Bay leaves
1    Kitchen spoon ground mace
1/2 oz Spanish Saffron
1 lb Whole anise
10    Whole lemons
veal bones

Boil turtle meat until tender; reduce stock and clarify. Add
ingredients for stock pot. To stock pot add carrots, onions, celery,
Burgundy, and Povirade sauce. Tighten with gelatin. This recipe will
yield approximately 10 gallons. Under refrigeration, the soup will
hold for several weeks.

Well, I hope this recipe helps in the use of turtles, though I
suspect you will have to have a very large family or like turtle soup
a lot, or scale the recipe to a more manageable quantity.
