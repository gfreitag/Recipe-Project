Title: NONFAT SCALLOPED POTATOES
Categories: Side dish, Low-fat
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Potatoes; well scrubbed
1 lg Onion (yellow)
1 1/2 c  Evaporated skim milk, approx
-(or amazake)
Freshly ground black pepper
Basil
Rosemary
Paprika
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Thinly slice the potatoes (leaving
skins on) and the onion.  Spray a glass baking dish with non-stick
spray. Layer the pan alternately with the potato and onion slices.
Just before the last layer, sprinkle on 1-3 tsp each of the pepper,
basil, and rosemary. Add the last layer of potatoes and onions. Pour
the evap skimmed milk (or amazake) over top. You should have enough
liquid to almost cover the mixture. Sprinkle on some paprika. Cover
with foil and bake for about an hour or until the liquid is all
absorbed. Remove foil for the last 15-20 minutes to crisp it a bit.

I guessed at the measurements for this dish, as I just sort of slap it
together without measuring.  Check it to see if it will be done early
or take a little extra time. It's a very forgiving dish. My only
complaint is that it doesn't freeze-and-reheat well (because of the
cooked potatoes).
