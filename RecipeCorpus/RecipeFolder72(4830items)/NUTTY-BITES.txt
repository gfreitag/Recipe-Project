Title: NUTTY BITES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 40 Servings
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
2 tb Light corn syrup
1/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
1/3 c  Raisins
2 c  Cornflakes
1/2 c  Hazelnuts; toasted, chopped
Put butter, corn syrup, cocoa and raisins in a medium-size saucepan;
stir over gentle heat until butter melts and mixture is well blended.
Remove from heat. Stir cornflakes and about 3/4 of the hazelnuts into
the melted mixture.  Spoon mixture into minature paper baking cups
placed on a baking sheet; sprinkle remaining hazelnuts over top.
Refrigerate 1 hour or until set.  Arrange Nutty Bites attractively on
a serving dish. If desired, use chopped candied cherries and toasted
almonds instead of hazelnuts and raisins.  Store in an airtight
container in a cool place for 2 to 3 days. Makes 30 to 40 cookies.
