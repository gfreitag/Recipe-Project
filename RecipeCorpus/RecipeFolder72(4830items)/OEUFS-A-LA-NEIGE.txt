Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 1/2 c  Low-fat milk
1    4x1-inch strip orange peel
1    Vanilla bean
-- split lengthwise
1/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Cornstarch
2 lg Eggs

FOR SAUCE: Combine milk and orange peel in heavy medium saucepan.
Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring mixture to simmer.
Combine sugar and cornstarch in medium bowl. Whisk in eggs. Gradually
add hot milk mixture, whisking constantly.  Return mixture to
saucepan. Cook over medium heat until mixture almost simmers and
thickens enough to coat spoon, stirring constantly, about 9 minutes;
do not boil. Strain into shallow bowl. Refrigerate until well
chilled, at least 2 hours. FOR MERINGUES: Place milk in heavy large
skillet. Add enough water to bring depth to 1-1/2 inches.  Bring
liquid to gentle simmer. Beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft
peaks form. Gradually add sugar and beat until meringue is stiff but
not dry. Using 2 soupspoons dipped into cold water, form 6 puffs from
half of meringue mixture, dropping each puff into simmering liquid.
Poach 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer meringues to kitchen
towel. Repeat procedure with remaining meringue. Arrange meringues
atop custard. Chill. (Can be made 4 hours ahead.)
