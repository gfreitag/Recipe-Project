Mix 1-1/2 tbsp of the fresh rosemary with the minced garlic and
spread half of the mixture underneath the skin of the chicken. Rub
the chicken with the remaining garlic mixture, cover, and refrigerate
for at leat 2 hours or overnight.  Remove and discard the papery
outer skin from each head of garlic, leaving the heads intact. Place
the garlic heads,remaining rosemary, and the 2 tsp oil on a 14 inch
long sheet of heavy duty foil, and seal tight.  Set a grill 6 inches
above white hot coals. Sprinkle the chicken with half of the pepper
and place on the grill along with the packet of garlic.  Cook,
turning often, for 30 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink
on the inside.

Meanwhile, mix the 2 tbsp oil with the parsley and remaining pepper.
Brush over the tomatoes and eggplant slices. Move the chicken and
packet of garlic to the edge of the grill, then place the tomatoes
and eggplant slices in the middle. Grill, turning once, for 15-20
minutes or until the eggplant is tender. About 5 minutes before the
eggplant is done, add the bread slices and grill, trunign once, until
lightly browned. Arrange the chicken,tomatoes, eggplant and bread on
a large platter. Separate the heads of garlic into cloves, squeeze
each clove to extract the pulp, and spead on the toast and
vegetables. Serves 4.
