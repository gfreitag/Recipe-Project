Title: NO BAKE FRUIT CAKE 2
Categories: Cakes, Holidays, Desserts, No-bake
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Seedless raisins
1 1/2 c  Pitted dates
1 lb Nuts of choice (I always use
-pecans)
1/2 lb Red candied cherries
1/2 lb Green candied cherries
1/2 lb Candied pineapple
1 cn Sweetened conden. milk
1 1/2 c  Crushed graham crackers
To 2 1/2 c.
-(my favorite) or
-vanilla wafers
-Butter to grease loaf pans
-or ring mold
Combine all ingredents except crushed cookies.  (I leave my fruit and
nuts whole but may be cut up if your wish.) Mix well to distribute
all the fruit and nuts in the milk. Gradually add the crushed cookies
to the mixture and stir.  As soon as the mixture is not "real" sticky
you will know you have enough crushed cookies mixed in. Butter your
loaf or ring pan very well and spoon in the fruit cake mixture. Press
down firmly with the back of a greased spoon (I just grease my
"clean" hands and push the mixture down to pack it well.) Cover with
plastic wrap or foil and place in the refridg. for at least 2 days.
When ready to serve, remove from refridg. and tip out on a serving
plate. IF there are any leftovers....;) you should store back in the
refridg.
