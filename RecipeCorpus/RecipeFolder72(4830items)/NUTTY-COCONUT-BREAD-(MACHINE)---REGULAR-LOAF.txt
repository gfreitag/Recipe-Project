pecans and walnuts make a harmonious trio in morning toast. Or serve
this bread freshly-baked as an accompaniment to your favorite fruit
salad.

For optimal flavor, use pure canned coconut milk instead of the
watter-added variety.

For additional chewy crunch, use shredded coconut.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
