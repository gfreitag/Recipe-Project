Recipe by: Joel.Ehrlich@salata.com (Joel Ehrlich) Cut off the top
part of the eggplants. Peel the eggplants. Slice the eggplants
crosswise into slices less than 1/4 " thick. Place the slices in a
large colander over a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with the coarse
grained salt. Place a dish on the eggplants as a weight to help
squeeze out the bitter liquid. Let stand for about 20 minutes. Heat
the solid shortening in a deep fryer. Wash the eggplant slices
carefully in cold water to remove all traces of th salt. Pat dry with
paper towels. Line a serving dish with paper towels. Lightly flour
the eggplant slices. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Deep fry the
eggplant slices, a few at a time, until they are lightly golde brown
on both sides (about 3 minutes). Remove the slices from the or deep
fryer and place on the prepared serving dish to drain. Sprinkle the
fried eggplant slices lightly with salt. Cut the prosciutto into
small pieces. Coarsely chop the parsley and marjoram together on a
board. Transfer these ingredients to a large bowl. Add the eggs and
milk. Mix well with a fork. Add salt and pepper to taste. Butter a
(13 1/2"x8 3/4"x1 3/4") oven safe baking dish. Place the eggplant
slices in the baking dish in layers. Pour the egg and seasoning
mixture over. Bake for 30 minutes. Serve immediately from the baking
