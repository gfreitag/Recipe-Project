ORIENTAL PANCAKES: Beat eggs in a large bowl with a wire whisk.
Combine the water, cornstarch, soy sauce and sugar; pour into eggs
and beat well. Heat an 8 inch omelet or crepe pan over medium heat.
Brush bottom of pan with vegetable oil; reduce heat to low. Beat egg
mixture; pour 1/4 cupful into skillet, lifting and tipping pan from
side to side to form a thin round pancake.  Cook about 1 to 1-1/2
minutes, or until firm. Carefully lift with spatula and transfer to a
sheet of waxed paper. Continue procedure, adding 1/2 teaspoon of oil
to pan for each pancake.  Makes 6 pancakes. MEAT FILLING: ombine
cornstarch, soy sauce and sherry in large bowl. Add beef, pork, green
onions, ginger and garlic; mix until thoroughly combined. ASSEMBLY:
Spread 1/2 cup meat mixture evenly over each pancake, leaving about a
1/2 inch border on one side. Starting with opposite side, roll up
pancake jelly-roll fashion. Place rolls, seam side down, in single
layer, on heatproof plate; place plate on steamer rack. Set rack in
large pot or wok of boiling water. Cover and steam 15 minutes. (For
best results, steam all rolls at the same time.) Just before serving,
cut rolls diagonally into quarters. Arrange on serving platter and
serve hot. Typed by Syd Bigger.
