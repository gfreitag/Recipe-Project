Makes one Generous Quart. Note: "New York Super Fudge Chunk was
developed as a regional flavor for the sophisticated New York palate.
After coming up with several variations in our Burlington lab,we
packed the samples in dry ice and shipped them by bus to our New

york consultants, a group of musicians on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Following several weeks of refinement and discussion, we all agreed
on this final recipe- a chocolate lover's dream." from Ben and
Jerry's Homemade Ice cream and Dessert book, by Ben Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield,(pg 34).
