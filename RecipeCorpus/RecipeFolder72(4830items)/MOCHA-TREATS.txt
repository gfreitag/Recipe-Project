Title: MOCHA TREATS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
4 oz Plain Cooking Chocolate
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
4 tb Custard Powder
2 tb Caster Sugar
2 ts Instant Coffee Granules
20 fl Milk
5 fl Soured Cream
MMMMM------------------------TO DECORATE-----------------------------
1 oz Grated Chocolate
Break up the chocolate and place in a bowl over a pan of hot water.
Leave until melted, stirring occasionally.

Use a pastry brush to brush the melted chocolate over the inside of 8
small brioche tins or other individual moulds in a thin layer. (you
can use double thickness paper cases instead.) Allow to set, then
repeat until all the chocolate is used.

Filling: mix sugar, custard powder and coffee together. Whisk in
about 5 fluid ounces of the milk.

Bring the remaining milk to the boil, remove from the heat and whisk
into the custard mixture. Pour back into the pan and stir constantly
over a low heat until thickened.

Transfer the custard to a bowl and cover the surface with a piece of
dampened greaseproof paper to prevent a skin forming. Leave to cool
completely. When cold, fold in the soured cream.

Loosen the top edge of each chocolate case with the point of a small
sharp knife. Press the sides of the tin gently until the chocolate
case has been removed. Fill each case with the custard.

Just before serving, decorate the top of each with raspberries and a
little grated chocolate.
