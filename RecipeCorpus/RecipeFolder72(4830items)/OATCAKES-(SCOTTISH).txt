1/2 ts Barcarbonate of Soda
Pinch of Salt
2 tb Bacon fat or Melted Butter
1/4 pt Hot Water

To test the correct heat of the gridle sprinkle it with a
:
little flour. If the flour browns at once it is too hot; it sould
take a few secounds to turn colour.
Set the oven to 375F/Gas 5 or heat a gridle or heavy
:
frying-pan. Mix the oatmeal, the bicarbonated of soda and salt
together in a bowl. Add the melted fat and the hot water. Stir well
until it makes a soft paste. Sprinkle some oatmeal on a board. From
the dough into a round and roll it out as thinly as possible, adding
oatmeal to the serface as necessary, to prevent sticking. Brush off
the excess oatmeal. Cut the dough into 4 or 6 pieces. To oven bake;
place on a large ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes. To
gridle bake; bake on a hot gridle or frying-pan until the edges begin
to curl. Turn over and cook the other side. Do not let the oatcakes
brown; they should be a pale fawn colour. Put on a wire rack to cool.
They are delicious served with cheese. :
