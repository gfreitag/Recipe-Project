Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
1 c  Fresh mint leaves
-- tightly packed
2    10 oz. cans condensed milk
1 qt Heavy cream
2 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 pn Salt
1/2 c  Southern Comfort or bourbon*
Green food coloring (opt'l.)

*Do not increase the amount of liquor in this recipe, since it will
prevent the ice cream from hardening properly. In a saucepan, bring
the sugar, water and mint to a boil. Simmer over medium heat for 5 to
8 minutes to make a simple syrup.  Cool and strain, discarding mint.
In a large bowl, combine the condensed milk, cream, milk, vanilla,
salt and liquor. Stir in the mint syrup.  Tint with a few drops of
food coloring, if desired. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze
according to manufacturer's instructions until firm.  Garnish with
additional mint sprigs. Yield: Approximately 2 quarts.
