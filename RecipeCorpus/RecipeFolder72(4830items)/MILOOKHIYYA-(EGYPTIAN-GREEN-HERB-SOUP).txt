Title: MILOOKHIYYA (EGYPTIAN GREEN HERB SOUP)
Categories: Soups, Middle east, Egyptian, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 qt Stock
1 c  Milookhiyya -=OR=- spinach,
-- washed & shredded
1 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Salt
Black pepper, freshly ground
2 ts Garlic, finely chopped
2 ts Ground coriander
2 tb Olive oil
In a heavy 3 to 4 qt saucepan, bring stock to a boil over high heat.
Stir in the milookhiyya, tomato paste, salt and a few grindings of
the pepper and reduce the heat to low. Stirring occasionally, simmer
for about 20 minutes, or until the milookhiyya has dissolved and the
soup is thick and smooth. With a mortar and pestle or the back of a
spoon, mash the garlic and coriander to a smooth paste.  In a small
skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat.  When hot, add the garlic
and coriander and, stirring constantly, cook for a minute or two
until the garlic is lightly browned. Add the entire contents of the
skillet to the soup and, stirring all the time, simmer for 2 or 3
minutes more. Taste for seasoning and serve at once from a heated
tureen.  In Egypt, milookhiyya is often accompanied by hot cooked
rice and sliced boiled chicken or game birds, presented separately on
individual plates.
