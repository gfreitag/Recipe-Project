=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a large bowl,
combine the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add the eggs, butter,
and vanilla, then fold in the apples. Pour the mixture into the pie
shell and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F. and
bake NOTE: I like to top each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped
cream or whipped topping and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
