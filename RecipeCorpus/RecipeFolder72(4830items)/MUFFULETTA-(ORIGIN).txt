Central Grocery's muffuletta (pronounced letta, not lotta) is the same
sandwich that has been served at the Decatur Street, New Orleans stor
for 9 decades. It's made of imported cheeses and meats and topped
with an olive salad that contains more than 40 spices and other
ingredients. The muffuletta-style bread was known earlie in Sicilyl
and immigrants brought the idea of baking the round loaves of Italian
bread to New Orleans where more than 1 baker served it as a sandwich
around the turn of the century. Putting the bread together with the
cold cuts, thus making the sandwich, is thought to be an American
version. The local family that has carried the tradition through to
modern fame is the Tusa familk, descendants of Salvatore Lupo, the
founder of Central Grocery. The sandwich ingredients are imported but
not all from Italy. Central Grocery's muffuletta contains Emmentaler
cheese from Switzerland, provolone cheese from Italy, Genoa salami,
Holland ham and mortadella sausage from Canada. The olive salad is a
family recipe. The sandwich is NOT served hot.
