Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
5 lg Eggs whites only
1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
1 pn Salt
1 c  Superfine sugar
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Coffee liqueur
1 tb Instant coffee powder
6 oz Coarsely chopped semisweet
-chocolate
24    Chocolate coffee beans
Preheat oven to 275 deg. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Draw
eight 3 inch circles on each. Beat whites with lemon juice* and salt
until soft peaks form. Add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time and beat
until stiff and shiny. Spoon meringue into pastry bag fitted with no.
5 star tip. Pipe rosettes or stars around circles, leaving space in
center. Bake until dry and slightly colored, about 45 minutes. Remove
from sheet and cool completely. Remove parchment. (Can be prepared 1
day ahead. Store in airtight container in dry place.)

Using electric mixer, beat cream with liqueur and coffee to stiff
peaks.

Melt chocolate in double boiler over gently simmering water. Using
spatula, spread thin layer of chocolate on baking sheet, smoothing
back and forth to even. Refrigerate 10 minutes. Using paint scraper
or putty knife held at slight angle, push chocolate away from you
quickly so chocolate folds into "ruffles." Repeat for a total of 8
ruffles. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Set 1 meringue on dessert plate. Top with another meringue. Fill
center with cream. Repeat with remaining meringues. Refrigerate 30
minutes. Garnish each with chocolate ruffle and 3 chocolate coffee
bean candies.

*Can substitute distilled white vinegar.
