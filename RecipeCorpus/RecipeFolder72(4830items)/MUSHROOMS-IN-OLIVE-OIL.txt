" The smallest mushrooms you can find in the market are the best for
preserving in oil. If you buy them in boxes that contain mixed sizes,
reserve the larger ones for other uses. Mushrooms prepared in this
way, like artichoke heats, made superb hors d'oeuvres when served
with salame (sic), carne secca and other cold cuts."
Cut all mushroom stems to be more or less the same length. Place
vinegar, lemon juice and salt in a saucepan (not aluminium) and bring
to a boil. Add mushrooms and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and cool
thoroughly for several hours. Add garlic and peppercorns and toss
lightly.
Place in glass jars and add olive oil to cover. Store in
refrigerator, where they will keep a few weeks. YIELDS: APPROX 1 1/2
