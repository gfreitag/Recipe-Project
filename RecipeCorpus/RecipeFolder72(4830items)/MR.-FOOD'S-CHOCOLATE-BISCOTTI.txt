============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 350 f . in a large bowl,
combine all the ingredients except the almonds; mix well with a
spoon. stir in the almonds until well blended; the dough will be
thick and sticky. Place half of the dough on a 10" x 15" rimmed
cookie sheet that has been coated with nonstick baking spray; form a
slightly rounded 4" x 12" loaf that is about 3/4 inch thick. Repeat
with the remaining dough on a second cookie sheet and bake for 30
minutes. Remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 F.
Allow the loaves to cool for 20 to 25 minutes. then cut into 1/2
~inch -thick slices. Lay the slices cut side down on the cookie
sheets and bake for 15 more minutes. Turn the cookies over and bake
for another 15 minutes or until very crisp. Allow to cool, then store
in an airtight container. NOTE: Biscotti are very crunchy. That's why
they're perfect for dunking in coffee, tea, hot chocolate,
cappuccino, and espresso.
