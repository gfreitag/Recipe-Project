1/2-inch-wide strips of peel lengthwise from eggplants, leaving
1/2-inch peel between the strips. Cut into thick slices, sprinkle
with salt, and let stand between two heavy plates while browning meat
and making sauce.
In frying pan melt the 4 tablespoons butter and in it saute meat
and onions until meat is browned. Add tomato paste, parsley, wine,
salt and pepper, and water. Simmer until liquid is absorbed. Cool.
Stir in cinnamon, eggs, cheese and half the bread crumbs.
Make sauce: In saucepan melt the 6 tablespoons butter over low
heat. Add flour and stir until well blended. Remove from heat.
Gradually stir in milk. Return to heat and cook, stirring, until
sauce is thick and smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste and the
nutmeg. Combine egg yolks with a little of the hot sauce, then stir
egg mixture into sauce and cook over very low heat for 2 minutes,
stirring constantly.
Brown eggplant slices on both sides in hot oil. Grease an
ovenproof casserole and sprinkle bottom with remaining bread crumbs.
Cover with layer of eggplant slices, then a layer of meat, and
continue until all eggplant and meat is used, finishing with a layer
of eggplant. Cover with sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese, and bake
in a 350-degree oven for 1 hour. Serve hot.
