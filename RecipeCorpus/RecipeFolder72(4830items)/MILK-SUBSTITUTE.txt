Title: MILK SUBSTITUTE
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
Zucchini squash
Trim all green from zucchini squash and discard.  Cut white part into
chunks and place in blender.  Liquefy. Substitute equal parts for
milk--no, and and no lactose! It may be frozen for future use. Freeze
in one-cup quantities for easy use. Source: Pat Eisenrich, De Leon
