Place an oven rack in center of the oven. Then turn on theoven and

over both cookie sheets. Pour the warm water into the mixing bowl.
Sprinkle theyeast over the water and let it stand about 5 min. to
soften. Then stir with the wooden spoon until completely blended. Add
the sugar, table salt, and 1 c. flour; stir until blended. Add 2 more
cups flour, 1/2 c at a time, stirring to blend after each addition.
The dough should be well blended. Sprinkle a little of the remaining
flour over a clean kitchen surface. Turn the dough out of the bowl
onto the floured surface. Knead until the dough is smooth and
elastic, sprinkling with flour if dough is sticky. Pull the dough
into 12 equal pieces. Roll 1 piece into a rope about 15 inches long,
then shape the rope into a pretzel or letter. Put the pretzel on one
of the baking sheets and repeat w/ the remaining pieces of dough.
Break the egg into the sm. bowl. Add 1 tablespoon water and stir
together w/ the whisk. Brush the egg wash over each pretzel, using
the pastry brush. Sprinkle with coarse salt with your fingers. Put
the oven mitts on and put a baking sheet in the oven. Bake until the
pretzels are golden brown. 15-20 min. Wearing mitts, carefully
transfer the sheet to a heatproof surface. Bake the second sheet of
pretzels. Using the spatula, transfer the pretzels from the baked
sheet to the rack to cool a little before serving them. Cool the
remaining pretzels when they are finished baking. FROM: My First
