Title: OKTAPODI TOURSI (PICKLED OCTOPUS)
Categories: None
Yield: 8 Servings
2 1/4 lb Young octopus
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
4    Garlic clove
Salt; to taste
Black pepper; to taste
1 ts Dried thyme
Lemon wedges, to serve
Prepare and wash the octopus (as in Octopus in Red Wine). Place the
head and tentacles in a pan with 6-8tbsp water, cover and simmer for
60 to 75 minutes until it is tender. Test it with a skewer. Drain off
any remaining liquid and set aside to cool.

Cut the flesh into 1/2" strips and pack them loosely into a
screw-topped jar.  Mix enough oil and vinegar to fill the jar - the
exact amount will depend on the relative volumes of the seafood and
the container - stir in the garlic and season with salt and pepper.
If you are using dried thyme, mix it with the liquid at this stage.
Pour it over the octopus, making sure that every last piece is
completely immersed. If you are using thyme stalks, push them into
the jar.

Cover the jar and set it aside for at least 4-5 days before using. To
serve, drain the octopus and serve it on small individual plates or
saucers with the lemon wedges.

Cubes of at least one-day old bread, speared on cocktail sticks, are
the usual accompaniment.
