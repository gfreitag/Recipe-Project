Title: MONSTER MUNCH
Categories: Snacks, Holiday, Nuts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Dry roast peanuts; unsalt
1/3 c  Butter or margerine
1 lb Marshmallows
1/2 c  Peanut butter
3 c  Puffed rice cereal
1 c  Apricots; chopped
1 c  Raisins
In a large bowl, combine cereal, apricots, raisins and peanuts. In a
microwave safe 13x9", melt butter and marshmallows on high for 2
minutes. Stir; add peanut butter cook on high 2 minutes longer. Stir
until well blended, add cereal mixture to dish and toss until well
coated. Working quickly with greased hand, form into balls, using
about 1/2 C mixture, per ball. If mixture begins to harden, cook on
high for 30 seconds, or until softened. If desired , mixture may be
spread in unbuttered 13x9" dish and cooled and cut into bars. Makes 1
dozen balls or 2 dozen bars, This is very similar to the Rice Krispie
treats, but with the apricaots and raisins it definitely gives it a
fall look. I saw another idea of putting the mixture into cookie
cutters, and letting it cool there so the shapes could be pumpkins,
witches, etc. With a little gel piping they would be great.
