Title: MOCK WHIPPED CREAM
Categories: Sauces, Low-cal, Low-fat, Desserts
Yield: 3 Servings
3/4 ts Unflavored gelatin
1 tb Cold water
1/2 c  Nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 c  Ice water
2 tb Confectioner's sugar
1 ts Vanilla
A fluffy, all-purpose topping that can double as a filling. Properly
whipped, it will be stiff enough to mound or pipe through a pastry
bag. Soften the gelatin in the cold water in a small heatproof
measuring cup. Set the cup in a pan of simmering water and heat about
4 minutes until the gelatin dissolves; remove from the heat. Combine
the dry milk, ice water, and confectioner's sugar in the chilled
small bowl of an electric mixer, then beat with chilled beaters at
medium speed until foamy. With the motor running, carefully pour the
gelatin down the side of the bowl so that it doesn't hit the beaters
and spatter all over. Continue beating at medium speed for 7 to 10
minutes until it is the texture of whipped cream, then beat in the
vanilla. If not using immediately, store in the refrigerator. If the
mixture should deflate on standing, simply beat until it again
resembles whipped cream. Makes 3 cups
