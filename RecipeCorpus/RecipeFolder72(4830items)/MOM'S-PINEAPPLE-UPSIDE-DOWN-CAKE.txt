MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
2 c  Light brown sugar (1 box)
1/2 c  Butter
2/3 c  Water
2 tb Karo
Grease 3 cast-iron skillets.  Drain pineapple rings, reserving juice.
Add all but 1 tablespoon of the juice to the buttermilk to make 1 1/2
cups fluid (equal parts, if possible).

Separate eggs; place all the whites in a large bowl, place 3 yolks in
one small container, and the other 3 in another. Prepare 3 8-inch
cake pans with brown-paper rounds (for bottoms) greased with
shortening. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Soften 1/2 C butter in a large bowl; add confectioner's sugar and beat
until thoroughly mixed. Add 3 egg yolks, one after another, and
continue beating.  Add vanilla and mix till thoroughly blended,
scraping sides with spatula if necessary.

Measure flour into a small bowl and stir in baking soda. Add to
butter/sugar mixture alternately with buttermilk in 4 steps,
beginning and ending with the flour.

Sprinkle about 1/2 t salt on egg whites.  Beat till stiff, but not
dry. Fold egg whites into batter.

TOPPING:  Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat; add 1 T of
pineapple juice and the sugar.  Add water and Karo and cook at a high,
rolling boil for about 3 minutes. Pour equally into prepared cast-iron
skillets (about 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick).  Place pineapple rings in
bottom of each skillet, and in the centers, place a cherry. (Can add
pecan halves, too.) Divide batter between pans and bake at 350
degrees F. about 30-35 minutes, until done.
