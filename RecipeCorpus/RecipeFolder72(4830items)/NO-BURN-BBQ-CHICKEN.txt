Title: NO BURN BBQ CHICKEN
Categories: Main dish, Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
8 ea Chicken thighs-boned
1/8 ts Salt
1 ea Onion, small-chopped
1/8 ts Paprika
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1/8 ts Parsley
1 ea Chicken bouillion cube, crus
1/8 ts Red pepper ground or cayenne
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Sage
1 x  Splash each vinegar and oil
Skin and bone chicken thighs or use boned, skinless breasts. ( The
butcher at my deli, does the thighs for me. He says it is easier to
do if the meat is semi frozen.) Combine all ingredients in shallow
bowl. Allow to marinate for at least 20 min. Gas Grill - Grill over
high heat 5 minutes, turn, reduce heat to medium. Baste with leftover
marinade. Grill 5 to 10 minutes more depending on thickness of meat.
Charcoal Grill - Cook over glowing coals for ten minutes, turning and
basting with the leftover marinade. Chicken is done when pierced with
the tip of a knife blade, and the "juice" is clear.  The marinade
gives it the flavor of a BBQ sauce with no sugary sauce to burn. Keep
a spray bottle of water nearby in case of a flare up if your chicken
is fatty.  Removing the skin, cuts out the added risk of flare ups
and the chicken cube gives it richer flavor. Thanks to all who
requested a repost! Linda JAX. FL  TWPK06B
