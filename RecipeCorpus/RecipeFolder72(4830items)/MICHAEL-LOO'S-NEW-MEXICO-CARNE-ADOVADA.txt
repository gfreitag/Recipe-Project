6    Cloves garlic, minced
1 ts Salt
1 tb Dave's Gourmet Insanity

-just a little
Combine first five ingredients and mix well. Place the pork in a
glass pan and cover with the sauce. Marinate overnight in the fridge.
Drain the cutlets. Broil them (or pan-broil them) for ten minutes or
until they are just cooked through. Meanwhile, strain the marinade
into a saucepan and heat for five minutes. Pour over cutlets. Serve
with rice and beans. An avocado salad helps cut the heat.

If you can't find Dave's, substitute for the sherry 1/2 c Melinda's
XXXtra Hot Sauce or Salsa Popular de Habanero plus 1 t sugar to cut
the vinegar.
