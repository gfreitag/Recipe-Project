Title: MR. FOOD'S FRESH APPLESAUCE
Categories: Desserts, Applesauce
Yield: 3 Servings
8    Granny Smith or other
- tart fresh apples
3/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg (optional)
Dash ground cinnamon
- (optional)
1 ts Grated lemon peel (optional)
=======================================================
============== ==== == Peel and core the apples; cut into thin slices
and place in a large pot. Add the water and sugar. Bring to a boil
then mix in the spices, if desired; reduce the heat to low, cover,
and simmer for 50 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally. NOTE: Cooking
time can vary, depending on the texture you like - for chunky
applesauce, cook it less; for smooth applesauce, cook it more. And if
your apples aren't really juicy, you may need to add a bit more water
during the simmering to prevent scorchi
