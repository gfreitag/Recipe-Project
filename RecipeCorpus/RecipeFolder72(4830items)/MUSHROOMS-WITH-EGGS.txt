Title: MUSHROOMS WITH EGGS
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
150 g  Mushrooms
1 tb Tarragon vinegar
2    Eggs
Salt and pepper
Mushrooms taste deliciously fresh cooked in this way - steamed in a
pan with a little tarragon vinegar, refreshingly sharp. The blandness
of the egg is a perfect match for them. This simple supper dish is
very quick and easy, yet distinctly different.

Trim the mushrooms, removing the ends of the stalks. Wash them and
pat dry. Cut each mushroom into fine slices and put them into a
well-greased frying-pan. Sprinkle with the vinegar and season with
salt and pepper. Cover, and cook over a gentle heat for about 10
minutes, shaking the pan from time to time.

Drop two eggs into the pan before all the water produced by the
mushrooms has evaporated. Leave to cook, uncovered, for a further 3-5
minutes, depending on individual taste.
