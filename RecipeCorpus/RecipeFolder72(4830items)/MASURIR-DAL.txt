Title: MASURIR DAL
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Bengali, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Water
1 c  Red lentils
1/4 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 ea Bay leaves
2 ea Dried red chiles
1/2 ts Kalonji seeds
1 c  Onion, thinly slivered
1 ts Green chile, chopped
1 ts Garam masala
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Cilantro, chopped
Bring water to a boil over medium heat & add lentils. Add turmeric &
simmer, covered, until the lentils are tender, about 15 minutes. They
are cooked when they easily break when pressed between the thumb &
index finger.  Add salt & sugar.  In a blender, puree until smooth.
Return to the pan & keep warm.

Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat.  Fry bay leaves & red
chiles until the chiles darken.  Add kalonji seeds & fry a few
seconds more. Add onion & fry until it darkens to a rich brown: do
not allow it to burn. If you have the heat nice & low, this should
take 15 to 18 minutes. Stir constantly.  Stir in the green chile &
pour this mixture over the pureed lentils.  Simmer for another 2 to 3
minutes.

Remove from the heat.  Stir in the garama masala, lemon juice (or
lime if you prefer) & cilantro. Garnish with lemon wedges & serve
immediately.
