Title: OAT FARLS
Categories: Bread/rolls, Ireland
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Rolled oats; (not instant)
2 1/4 c  Buttermilk
2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
Recipe by: From Celtic Hearths The day before serving, mix the oats
with 1-1/4 cups of the buttermilk in a bowl. Cover and let stand
overnight at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly
grease a baking sheet and set aside. Sift together the flour, salt
and baking soda. Gradually beat the flour mixture into the
oat-buttermilk mixture, adding remaining buttermilk as you work, to
form a soft dough. You may not need to use the full 2-1/4 cups
buttermilk. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and flatten with
hands or floured rolling pin so that it forms a circle about 1 inch
thick and 9 to 10-inches in diameter. With a sharp knife, cut into
quarters or eighths, as desired, and place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until browned. Serve warm. Note: These are
high in fiber and low in fat, provided you don't slather th with
butter. Delicious with jam or marmalade. Yield: 8 servings.
