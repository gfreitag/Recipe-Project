Cream butter and sugar until light.  Add flour and salt. Chill
slightly and roll 1/8" thick between wax paper sheets. Roll only a
small amount of dough at a time. Using a 2 1/2" cookie cutter, cut
cookies. Cut center out of half of cookies (I use my thimble to cut
centers). Bake all cookies on ungreased sheets at 400~ for 8-10
minutes or less, until very lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
Spread whole cookies with preserves, piled higher in center.  Top
with cookie ring. Sprinkle with 4x sugar. Store in tin box between
layers of wax paper.
