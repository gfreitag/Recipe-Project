Recipe by: The County Fair Cookbook - ISBN 0-7868-6014-6 1. In a large
bowl, beat eggs until light. Stir in milk and sugar. 2. In another
large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg
together. Stir half of the flour into the egg mixture. Add the butter
and lemon juice and mix until combined. Stir in the remaining flour
mixture to make the dough. Cover and chill about 90 mins. 4. On a
floured work surface, roll out the dough about 1/2 inch thick. Cut
with a doughnut cutter or cookie cutter into 3-inch rounds; cut out
the centers and either fry them for doughnut holes or roll again to
get a larger yield. 5. In a deep heavy skillet, heat 3 inches of
shortening to 365 F on a deep-frying thermometer. Fry 3 or 4
doughnuts at a time, turning with tongs, 2 to 3 mins or until golden
brown. Drain on paper towels. Replace the shortening as needed. Dust
with sugar, if desired. Note from Barbara says these are delicious
dipped in fresh maple syrup.
