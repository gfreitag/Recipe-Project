Salsa di Pomodoro Della Mamma To quote the author, "Children don't
usually like to see pieces of tomatoes and ingredients floating in
their sauce (we certainly didn't!), so our Mother used to prepare
tomato sauce the following way." Place the onion and half of the oil
in a saucepan and cook until the onion is lightly browned.
Add tomatoes, carrot, parsley, garlic, salt, basil and celery. Cook,
covered, over moderate heat, stirring very occasionally, for 1/2 hour
or until the vegetables are very soft.
Strain through a food mill, taste for salt and adjust if necessary.
(If sauce is too thin, place on heat again to thicken. ) Remove from
heat, add the remaining oil and stir.
NOTE: For a marinara or a more piquant sauce, just before adding the
last oil, add 1/4 tsp crushed hot red pepper and 1 clove garlic
passed through a garlic press or chopped very fine. YIELDS: 3 cups,
SERVES 6-8
