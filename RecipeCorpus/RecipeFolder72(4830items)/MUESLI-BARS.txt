3 1/2 ts Full-cream milk powder
4 oz Butter

1/2 c  Peanut butter

NOTES:

*  Delicious and nourishing bars for hiking or home are ideal to use
as trail bars, being both filling and full of energy, but are also
perfect as snacks at home or work.

*  The bars are best kept in the refrigerator, although it's by no
means essential.  They soften in the heat but don't disintegrate.

*  Any other cereal crumbs can be combined with cornflakes to make up
the 3 cups.  It's a good way to use up those otherwise annoying
scraps. If too much powdery stuff goes in, the bars can be somewhat
dense. Using Rice Bubbles (Rice Krispies) gives a lighter texture.

*  Desiccated coconut is best, as shredded coconut is too course.
