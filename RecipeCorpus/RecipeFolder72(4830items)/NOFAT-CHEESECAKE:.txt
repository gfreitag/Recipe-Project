TOPPING:  (This is my mom Sophie's recipe for pie filling):

3 cups berries (not strawberries) 5 - 10 packets of Equal Sweetener
or 1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon of thickener (flour, or
arrowroot, or corn or potato starch) 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4
teaspoon lemon juice

Put 1/2 of berries in a small pot (or microwave safe dish). Mix in
thickener. Heat to a boil, stirring.

Add sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice.  Don't add Equal at this time.
Stir as it cooks and thickens.  Turn off heat. Add Equal, if you are
using it. Stir in remainder of berries. Do not cook further.
Refrigerate if you like it cool, or use immediately if you want the
berries warm.
