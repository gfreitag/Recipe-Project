Title: MENNONITE WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
Categories: Breads, Penndutch
Yield: 4 Loaves
2 pk Yeast, dry
4 c  ;Water, warm
1/2 c  Butter; softened
1/4 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Honey
2 ts Salt
6 c  Flour, whole wheat
4 c  Flour, white
Dissolve yeast in the warm water.  Combine butter, molasses, honey,
and salt.  Mix well.  Add yeast mixture. Gradually add flour. Turn
onto a floured board and knead until smooth (this will take a fair
amount of shoulder; the dough is fairly heavy).  Place in a large
greased bowl, then turn to grease the top. Cover with a clean tea
towel, and let rise until doubled, about two hours.

Punch dough down, and let it rest a few minutes. Divide into
quarters, and shape into loaves.  Place in greased bread pans, and
let rise about one hour.  Bake at 375 F. for 35 to 40 minutes.
