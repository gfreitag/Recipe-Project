the paprika, cayenne, lemon zest, and the remaining stock and simmer
briskly for about 10 minutes, and then swirl in the yogurt.

hours. We put it to strain at the beginning of the preparation,
results were fine. 2. The original recipe calls for 1 cup of
vegetable stock, in lieu of chicken broth. Contributor: Ornish,Joyce
