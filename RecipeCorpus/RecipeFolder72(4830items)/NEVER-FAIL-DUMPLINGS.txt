Title: NEVER FAIL DUMPLINGS
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 8 Dumplings
3 ts Baking Powder
1 c  Flour
1 md Egg
6 tb Cold water
1 tb Oil
1 ts Salt
Beat the egg well then add the 6T of cold water. Measure the Water
carefully. Add the oil and salt and whisk together. Mix the
baking-powder and flour together. Blend the two mixes into a smooth
batter quickly. Drop into boiling stew and cover continuing to boil
for 15- 20 mins. Try to resist the urge to peek too often - the
dumplings will rise and produce a light tender crust - a cold draught
will cause them to fall. They can also be served as a dessert by
cooking in boiling water and served with pancake syrup or jam
drizzled over them. As a young boy scout in England during the war
these were or main camp dessert as the ingredients were usually
available from our skimpy home "Rations". There we called them
"Sinkers". We cooked and ate them by the dozen with our "fresh-air"
appetites and the name described the resulting feeling in our young
bellies quite well ! When I am travelling I usually make up the dry
ingredients into batches and carry them in zip-lock bags ready to add
liquid and the egg when I am ready to use them.
