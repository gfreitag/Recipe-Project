Title: OATBURGERS WITH MUSHROOMS
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 20 Servings
1    Large onion, diced
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms; diced
1/4 c  Oil
4 1/2 c  Water
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/4 c  Nutritional yeast
1/2 ts Seasalt
1/3 c  Soy sauce
1/4 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Thyme
5 c  Old fashioned
rolled oats

Saute the first four ingredients in a covered saucepan. While they are
sauteeing, bring to a boil all the other ingredients except the oats.
Lower heat, add the sauteed vegetables, and add the oats, one cup at
a time, sallowing each cupful to sink a little before stirring
gently. Cook up to five minutes--until mixture starts to stick to
bottom of pot. Set aside to cool. It's much easier to form the
patties if the mixture has cooled at least 10-15 minutes. Form into
patties, place on oiled cookie sheet, bake at 350 degrees for about
45 minutes. Turn once after about 20 minutes. Makes about 20- 25
burgers. Oatburgers lend themselves to many variations. Some further
suggestions are dill, parsley, celery, green or red peppers in
placeof the mushrooms. (From _Vegetarian Cooking for a Better World_,
