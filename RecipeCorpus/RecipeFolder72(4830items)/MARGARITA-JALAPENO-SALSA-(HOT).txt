Title: MARGARITA JALAPENO SALSA (HOT)
Categories: Other sauce, Salsas
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Cubed tomato, 1/2 " cubes
1/2 c  Chopped red or white onion
4 ea Or more copped jalapenos
1 ea Clove garlic, minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Gold or white tequila
A splash of tequila makes all the difference in this robust salsa; it
has a way of mellowing the searing nature of terrifically hot foods.
I like this sauce on seafood, chicken, and any king of chops - pork,
veal or lamb.

Combine all ingredients and let stand for at least 30 minutes at room
temperature.  Taste and adjust seasonings. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
