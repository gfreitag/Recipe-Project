Categories: Marinades, Meats, Poultry, Fish/shellf
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Onion; finely chopped
3    Sprigs parsley
3    Scallions; chopped
1/4 ts Powdered bay leaf
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Dried oregano
1    Clove garlic; crushed
Juice of 1 lemon
3/4 c  Oil
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly. Pour the mixture over the
meat, chicken or fish to be marinated and allow to steep for 2 hrs.,
turning occasionally. Then grill meat, and,if desired,slice thin and
serve on garlic bread. Below is another recipe. Just a quickie, but
quite good. I don't have amounts for everything. Just use your
judgement accdng to how much meat you have. Soy sauce; a little red
wine (optional); a bunch of garlic powder, and onion powder. Marinate
at least one hour, turning once. >>> Grill and do same as with other
marinade to serve. These two recipes are the only way we will eat
steak. We are in cold climate in fall and winter, so we don't get to
grill all year, but if we could, we would!! E N J O Y P.S. The red
wine in the second recipe also helps tenderize the meat, in addition
to adding flavor. FROM: DONNA HARTMAN (HDDW83B)
