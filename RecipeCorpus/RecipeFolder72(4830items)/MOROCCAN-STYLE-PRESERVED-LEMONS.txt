Title: MOROCCAN-STYLE PRESERVED LEMONS
Categories: Preserves
Yield: 12 Servings
12    Lemons
Kosher salt -- as needed
Procedures:   Select twelve unblemished organically grown small
lemons, preferrably Meyer (a small type). Wash and dry the lemons. If
using store-bought lemons, scrub them carefully to remove any
pesticides. Cut a thin slice from the top and the bottom of each
lemon. Set one lemon on end and make a vertical cut 3 quarters of the
way through the fruit, so that the 2 halves still remain attached at
the base; do not cut it in half. Turn the lemon upside down and
rotate it so that you can make a second vertical cut down the center,
crosswise to the first, leaving the bottom attached, as you did
previously. Fill each cut with as much salt as it will hold.
Carefully place the lemon at the bottom of a hot, sterilized,
wide-mouthed quart glass jar. Proceed in this manner with the
remaining lemons, compressing them in the jar untilno space is left
and the lemon juice has risen to the top. Seal and set aside at room
temperature. More lemons may be added in the following days as the
lemon rinds begin to soften. Make sure the lemons are covered with
juice at all times, adding freshly squeezed lemon juice if necessary.
The lemons are ready to use when the rinds are tender, in 5 to 6
weeks. Rinse them lightly before using. Once opened, refrigerate
:
preserved lemons for up to 6 months. Makes 12 lemons. Recipe By
