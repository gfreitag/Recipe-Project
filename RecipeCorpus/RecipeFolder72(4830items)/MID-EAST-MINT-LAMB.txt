Title: MID EAST MINT LAMB
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Lamb
4    Sprigs (6in long) fresh mint
6    Cloves garlic
1    Sprig (3 in.) fresh lavender
3 T  Butter
The cooking is quite simple. Dice lamb into cherry sized pieces. Chop
herbs, making certain to chop the garlic and lavender finely, and fry
all over medium high flame till meat just done (about 5 min, but
peoples tastes vary widely on what is cooked lamb). Tastes fantastic
in pita bread with some hummos and tabbouleh and maybe a bit of baba
ghannouj. If fresh herbs are unavailable, use about 2 tablespoons
mint, and one or two teaspoons of lavender. The difference between
the flavor of fresh and dried is enough to convince people to give up
kitchen window sills to herbs. Also note that some people may think
that that is a lot of garlic. We like garlic, we sometimes add more...
