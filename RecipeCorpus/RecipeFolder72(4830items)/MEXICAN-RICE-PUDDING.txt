4 tb Flour
3/4 c  Sugar

1 c  Hot steamed rice (white or

Heat the milk. Beat the egg whites to stiff but not dry peaks; set
aside.

Blend together the egg yolks, flour, sugar, salt an
1/2    cup of the hot milk.

Using a whisk, beat the yolk mixture into remaining milk.

Cook, stirring, over medium heat for 5 minutes.

Add the hot rice and continue cooking and stirring for 10 minutes, or
until the custard has thickened. Stir in the vanilla.

Pour the hot custard over the top of the beaten egg whites and gently
fold until blended (the custard will poach the egg whites).

Sprinkle cinnamon over the top.
