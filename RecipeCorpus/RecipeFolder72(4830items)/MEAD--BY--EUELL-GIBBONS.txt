Title: MEAD  BY  EUELL GIBBONS
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Honey
Yield: 1 Gallon
1 ga Water
4 lb Honey
6    Cloves
2    Sticks cinnamon
Juice & peel from one lemon
1 ts Activated dry yeast
In a large nonreactive pot, add the next four ingredients to the
gallon of water.  Boil all together for 30 minutes, then strain into
a crock that will hold it with a little room to spare. When cooled,
add the yeast, dissolved in some of the liquid.  Allow to ferment in
a cool place - 55 degrees is ideal - until it ceases bubbling and the
liquor clears, then bottle, cap tightly and store in a cool, dark
cellar. It should not be used for at least a month, and longer is
better.

Mead unlike many other drinks, does not improve with really long
aging, so it should be consumed within a year of the time it was
made. ;+}
