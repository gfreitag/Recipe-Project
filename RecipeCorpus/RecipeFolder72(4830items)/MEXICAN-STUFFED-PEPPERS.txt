Wash the peppers and cut them in half lengthwise.
Remove the seeds.

Place the peppers, cut side facing down, on a rack above boiling
water. Cover the pot and steam for about 10 minutes, or until the
peppers are just beginning to get soft. To ensure even doneness, do
not stack the peppers on top of each other; keep them in a single
layer. If you have a wok with a steaming rack, all the peppers can be
steamed at the same time. If not, do them in two batches.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Ad the onions, celery, cumin,
chili powder, basil and oregano. Saute until the onions are almost
tender.

Add the cooked rice and beans. Mix well; then add the shoyu or
tamari and the cayenne to taste. Mix again.

Lightly oil a shallow 7 - x - 11" baking dish. Fill each pepper with
the bean and rice mixture and place the peppers side by side in the
baking dish.

Mix together the canned tomatoes and the tomato paste.
If the tomatoes ar whole, chop them or break themup with a fork.

pour the tomato mixture over the stuffed peppers.
Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake at
350    deg for 30 minutes.

Serve with a big green saslad and slices of ripe avocado.

Variation:

Use 2 cups of tomato sauce instead of the canned tomatoes mixed with
tomato paste.
