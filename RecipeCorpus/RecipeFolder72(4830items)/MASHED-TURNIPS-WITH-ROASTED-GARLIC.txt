We used a pear to sweeten the strong flavor of turnips, then added
some roasted garlic for a robust alternative to mashed potatoes.
Steam turnips over boiling water until fork tender, about 15
minutes. Drain turnips and place in a food processor or blender along
with pear, garlic, and margarine. Process until smooth, adding skim
milk as needed. Season with salt and pepper.
Makes 8 servings.
