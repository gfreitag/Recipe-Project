Not unlike a That version of spaghetti sauce, this is from the
regional cuisine of north Thailand. Note: Dried shrimp and shrimp
paste give off a strong aroma during cooking, but the flavor mellows.

Place pork in a food processor and using an on/off motion, process
until it is ground. Alternatively, chop pork with a sharp knife. Set
aside.

In a heavy, medium-sized saucepan, heat oil over medium high heat. Add
garlic and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned. Add
shallots, chilies, dried shrimp or shrimp paste and lemon grass and
stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the pork and stir-fry for about 1
minute, or until browned. Add tomatoes, stock or water, fish sauce
and sugar and increase the heat to high. Cook, stirring frequently,
for 2 minutes, or until the mixture boils vigorously. Reduce heat to
low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until slightly
thickened. Serve with sticky rice.

Serves 4 as a main dish or 6 in combination with other dishes.
