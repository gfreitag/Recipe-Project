Place potatoes in medium saucepan with water to cover and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to low and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Drain the potatoes, and cool under running water. Refrigerate until
chilled.

While potaaaatoes are chilling, combine sour cream and yogurt. When
potatoes are chilled through, cut them in half. Cut a small slice off
of each rounded end so that the potatoes sit without rolling. Place a
teaspoonful of the sour cream mixture on each potato. Top with chives
and a half teaspoonful of caviar.  Top with freshly ground black
pepper if desired.
