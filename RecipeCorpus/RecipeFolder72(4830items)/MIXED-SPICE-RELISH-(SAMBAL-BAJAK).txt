Title: MIXED SPICE RELISH (SAMBAL BAJAK)
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
10    Red chillis
1 sl Terasi
10    Shallots
5    Cloves garlic
3    Kemiri (candlenuts)
3 tb Vegetable oil
Salt
1 ts Brown sugar
1 c  Thick santen (coconut milk)
This is a hot relish, and to make it all the ingredients have to be
pounded together. If you do this in a mortar, try to keep the mixture
off your fingers as much as possible if you have sensitive skin; it
is not only your tongue that can feel the effects of a strong chilli.
Sambal Bajak will keep for a long time in an air tight jar, and lose
none of its fierceness.

Take the first five ingredients above-that is, the chillis, terasi,
shallots, garlic, and kemiri-and pound them all together into a fine
paste. Alternatively, mince them first as fine as you can and then
put them in a liquidizer. Saute them in the vegetable oil for a few
minutes, then add the salt, sugar and santen. Simmer gently for 20
minutes, and finish by cooking on a high flame, stirring
continuously, for 1 minute.

Let the sambal cool before you store it. It can be served hot or
cold, and can be reheated many times without impairing the flavour.
If you have used a mincer and liquidizer during the preparation, wash
them several times in hot water and with plenty of detergent before
you use them for anything else.
