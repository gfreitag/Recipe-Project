Heat 5 cups corn oil to 325 degrees in a deep fryer or high-sided
saucepan. When hot, add half of the tortilla strips. Stirring
constantly, fry for 35 seconds or until crisp. Do not overcook or
tortillas will lose their color and burn. Remove from oil with a
slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining
tortillas.

In a large bowl combine beans, jicama, bell peppers, 3 tablespoons
corn oil, lime juice, cilantro and chilies; season to taste with salt
and toss to mix. Gently toss in tortilla threads, being careful not
to break them but making sure they are well coated with dressing.
Serve immediately.

* Red and blue corn tortillas may be found at Mexican markets or
specialty food stores
