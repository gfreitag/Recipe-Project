Categories: Meats, Beverages
Yield: 6 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
2 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork or
1/2 lb Sausage meat
2 lg Onions; chopped
3 cl Garlic; minced
1/2 c  Fresh parsley; minced
2 ts Dried oregano
2 ts Dried thyme
2 ts Nutmeg
2 ts Salt; optional
1 ts Pepper
3 tb Teriyaki sauce or
1 tb Soy sauce; low sodium
-preferred
2 tb Dijon mustard
1 c  Dry red wine
2 c  Unsalted crackers; crushed
1/2 c  Walnuts; finely minced
2    Eggs; slightly beaten
1/2 lb Cheddar cheese; cut into
-1/8-inch slices
Parsley sprigs
Into a large bowl place all the ingredients except the cheese and
parsley sprigs in the order given.  Knead the mixture well to mix
thoroughly,. Divide the mixture in half and form each half into a
compact loaf approximately 1 1/2 inches in depth.  Place the cheese
on the top of one of the loaves and top with the other loaf. Pinch
the loaves together well, to seal.  Place in a shallow roasting pan
and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven 1 hour.  Remove from the
oven. Slice the loaf and arrange slices on a a warm platter. Garnish
with parsley sprigs.

Judi's Notes:  I think a 400 degree oven is too high for meat loaf
and so always bake my meat loaves at 350-375 degrees and just cook it
a few minutes longer. I also like to remove some of the fat and
juices that accumulate in the pan about half way through cooking by
using a turkey baster to suction in out of the pan.
