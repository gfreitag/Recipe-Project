Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  For cake batter, cream butter in a
large mixer bowl until fluffy.  Gradually beat in sugar until light
and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Stir in lemon peel and vanilla.

Combine dry ingredients.  Blend in dry ingredients alternately with
sour cream, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Mix well after
each addition.  Gently fold in dried fruit.

For streusel, place all ingredients in a small bowl. Combine
ingredients using a pastry cutter until mixture is crumbly. Spoon
one-third of the batter evenly into well-buttered and floured 10-inch
tube pan. Sprinkle with one-half of the streusel.  Repeat. Spread
remaining one-third of cake batter over streusel. Bake for 55-60
minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.
Let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely
on wire rack. Cover and store at room temperature up to five days.

Cake may be made ahead of time and frozen up to two months. Thaw,
wrapped in refrigerator.
