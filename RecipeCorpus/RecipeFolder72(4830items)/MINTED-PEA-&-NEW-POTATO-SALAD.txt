Title: MINTED PEA & NEW POTATO SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 2 Servings
350 g  Small new potatoes
- scrubbed
1 tb Wine vinegar
2 tb Olive oil
175 g  Frozen peas, lightly cooked
5 tb Mayonnaise
2 tb Finely chopped fresh mint
Salt and pepper
Serves 2-3

A potato salad with a difference, this is a delightful summer dish.
New potatoes are mixed with lightly cooked peas and some fresh mint,
and lightly dressed with oil and vinegar. Lovely with a tossed salad
and warm bread.

Simmer the new potatoes for about 5 minutes, or until tender but
still firm and crisp. Drain. While the potatoes are still warm,
quarter them and halve the quarters. In a bowl drizzle the warm
potatoes with the vinegar and the oil, season them with salt and
pepper, and toss them carefully to coat them with the marinade.

Let the potatoes marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 2 hours
or overnight. Then add the peas, mayonnaise, mint, and salt and
pepper to taste and stir the mixture carefully. Transfer the salad to
a salad bowl and let it come to room temperature.
