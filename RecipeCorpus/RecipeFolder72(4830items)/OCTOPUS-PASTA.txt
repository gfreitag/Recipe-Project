Title: OCTOPUS PASTA
Categories: Seafood, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 sm Octopus (about 3 1/4 pounds)
1/2 c  Olive oil
1    Pinch Rosemary
1    Bay leaf
1    Pinch Oregano
1 ts Cumin seeds
Chopped parsley
1    Green chili pepper chopped
1/2 lb Tomatoes -- peeled and cut
3    Cloves garlic chopped
Salt and pepper
1 lb Spaghetti
The octopus must be very carefully washed and dried, and the mouth
removed. Cover the bottom of a saucepan with oil; add the rosemary,
bay leaf oregano, cumin seeds, parley, chili pepper, tomatoes and
chopped garlic. Place the octopus on top of this mixture and season
with salt and pepper. Cover the pot very tightly and simmer for about
45 minutes. Cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water
until it is 'al dente' (firm to the bite). Drain and turn onto a warm
serving dish. Mix the octopus sauce into the spaghetti. Serve piping
hot. NOTE: I used cleaned fresh squid from the fish counter...easier
and cheaper!
