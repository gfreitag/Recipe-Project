The Cheese: Bring milk to boil over high heat in 4 qt. saucepan. As
soon as foam begins to rise, remove from heat and gently but
thoroughly stir in yoghurt and lemon juice. Curds will begin to
solidify immediately and seperate from the whey.
Pour contents of pan into seive line with double thickness of
cheesecloth. Drain undisturbed until cool enough to handle. Wrap cloth
tightly around curds, wring out vigorously to squeeze out excess
liquid. Reserce 1 cup of whey.
Place cheese wrapped in cheesecloth on cutting board, cover with
another board or skillet and weigh the top with 15 pounds of canned
goods. Let rest 6-8 hours until cheese is firm and compact.
Unwrap, cut into 1/2" cubes, cover and refrigerate until ready to
use.
The Peas:  Heat ghee in skillet, add cheese cubes and fry 4-5
minutes, turning gently until golden brown on all sides. Transfer to
a plate as they brown.
Add ginger and garlic to ghee remaining in skillet. Fry for 30
seconds, stirring constantly. Add onions and salt, fry 7-8 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and golden brown.
Stir in 1/4 cup whey, add turmeric, red pepper, ground coriander and
garam masala. When well blended, stir in remain whey and tomatoes.
Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to low and simmer covered for
10 minutes, stirring occassionaly. Add peas and taste for seasoning.
If too acid, add up to 1 teaspoon sugar.
Remove cover, cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cheese
cubes and 1 tablespoon coriander. Cover tightly, simmer over low heat
10-20 minutes or until fresh peas are tender.
