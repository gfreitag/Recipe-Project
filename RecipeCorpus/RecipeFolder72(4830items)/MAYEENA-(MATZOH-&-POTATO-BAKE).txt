Jewish, Africa, Egypt
8    Matzohs, broken into 3" Pieces
2    Eggs, beaten
2 T  Corn oil
1 lb Cooked chicken or beef, cut Into small cubes
1 c  Onions, chopped
1/4 t  Allspice
1/4 t  Pepper
1 t  Salt
1/8 t  Nutmeg, grated
1 lb Potatoes, peeled and Quartered
2    Eggs, beaten
1/4 t  Salt
1/8 t  Pepper Lemon wedges

1.  Moisten the matzoh in warm water for a few minutes to soften them
and gently press out the excess liquid. Oil a 1-1/2 quart, heatproof
glass or metal baking dish. Dip the matzoh pieces into the first 2
beaten eggs and lay them in baking dish in an orderly layer.

2.  In a skillet, heat the oil.  Add the meat, onions, allspice,
pepper, salt, and nutmeg.  Stir-fry over moderate heat for 3 minutes.
Spread the mixture over the matzoh in the baking dish.

3. In a pan, boil the potatoes in water until soft but still firm. In
a processor, puree the potatoes and spread the puree over the meat
layer. Poke 8 holes about 1" deep in the puree.

4.  In a bowl, beat the remaining 2 eggs with the salt and pepper.
Pour the mixture over the potato puree. Bake in preheated, 375 degree
F. over for 1/2 hour.

Serve hot, cut into generous squares, with wedges of lemon. Makes 6
to 8 servings.

VARIATION:  Mayeena may be prepare as a dairy dish. Simply replace
the meat with 2 cups (1 pound) of cottage cheese mixed with 1 cup
grated yellow cheddar cheese. Scatter this over the matzoh in the
baking dish and cover with the potato puree and egg.

Bake in a preheated, 375 degree over for 1/2 hour.

Passover food is limiting but the Egyptian Jews have artfully
concocted a mayeena that conforms to the Passover ritual for both
dairy and meat occasions.
