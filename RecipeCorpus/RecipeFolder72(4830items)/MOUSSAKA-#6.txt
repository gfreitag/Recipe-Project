Title: MOUSSAKA #6
Categories: Greek, Hamburger
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Ground beef
1 c  Chopped onion
Olive oil
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Tomato paste
2 tb Minced parsley
1    Stick butter
Salt & pepper
2 md Eggplants
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
2    Eggs, well-beaten
1/2 c  Grated cheese
Brown the meat & onion in some olive oil. When well-browned, add
water, tomato paste, parsley, butter, & salt & pepper & let it simmer
on low for 1 hour or more, until sauce is thickened. In the meantime,
peel & cut lengthwise the eggplants in 1/4" thick slices. Saute in
olive oil to a golden brown. Add 2 tbs bread crumbs to the meat sauce
& mix well. Butter a baking dish well & sprinkle with some bread
crumbs. Place 1/2 of eggplant slices in the dish, & spread 1/2 of the
meat sauce on top - repeat. Pour eggs on top & spread evenly.
Sprinkle with cheese & bread crumbs & bake at 350 for 1/2 hour or
until golden. Serve with cheese sauce, if you want - I usually don't.
