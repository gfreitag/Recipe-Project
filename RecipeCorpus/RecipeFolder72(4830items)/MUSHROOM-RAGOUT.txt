Title: MUSHROOM RAGOUT
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 8 Servings
1 oz Dried porcini mushrooms (see
Note)
2 tb Diluted balsamic vinegar
1 lg Red onion, finely minced
2 sm Garlic cloves, finely
Minced
1 lb Fresh brown mushrooms, such
As cremini or
Portobello, well-cleaned
And sliced
3    4 small ripe plum tomatoes,
Chopped
1 tb Chopped flat leaf parsley
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Soak dried mushrooms in warm water to cover for at least 45 minutes or
until softened. Remove from liquid carefully and rinse well under cold
running water to remove any sand clinging.

Chop mushrooms roughly and drain thoroughly. Strain soaking liquid at
least twice through a sieve lined with cheesecloth and reserve.

Heat a couple of teaspoons of reserved mushroom liquid and diluted
balsamic vinegar in a heavy skillet and saute onion until translucent
and tender, 10-15 minutes. Use additional mushroom liquid if onions
start to stick. Add garlic and all mushrooms, turn heat to low and
cook, stirring intermittently, for up to 20 minutes, until tender.
Add tomatoes, parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking
another 5 minutes.

Serve over slices of polenta.

Note: the dried porcini are expensive but integral. They have an
incredible woodsy flavor and odor.
