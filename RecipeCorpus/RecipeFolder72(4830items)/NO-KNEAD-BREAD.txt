Title: NO-KNEAD BREAD
Categories: Breads, Low-fat, Mcdougall
Yield: 2 Servings
7 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
2 tb Active dry yeast
1 tb Molasses; unsulphered
4 c  Water; warm
Recipe by: McDougall Plan Put flour in a large bowl. Place in a warm
oven for 30 minutes to warm flour and bowl to 110 degrees (1 1/2
minutes in microwave). Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water (110
degrees). Add molasses and mix well. Let rest about 3 minutes. Then,
add the yeast mixture and the remaining water (3 cups, warm). Mix
well by stirring or use one hand to mix in bowl. Do no Knead. Dough
will be sticky. Use non-stick pans or lightly oil two large loaf pan
(9"x5"x3"). Sprinkle with cornmeal. Spoon dough mixture into pans.
Smooth top with hand dampened with water to prevent sticking. Cover
with towel. Place in a warm spot. Let rise about 1 hour or until
dough reaches top of pans. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake for 20
minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake 30-40 minutes longer.
Remove pans from oven, tip pans on sides, and let cool on racks for
15 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and continue to cool before
storing. Bread is moist, so keep best in refrigerator.

HELPFUL HINTS: Recipe may be doubled to make four loaves. Refrigerate
or freeze extra loaves until ready to use. Other flours may be used
in place of 1.5 cups whole wheat, such as brown rice flour, garbanzo
flour, or barley flour. Use of nonstick pans is recommended. From the
