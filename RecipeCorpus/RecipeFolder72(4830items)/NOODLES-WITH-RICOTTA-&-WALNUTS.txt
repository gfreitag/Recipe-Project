put together sauce ingredients. Have ready heated serving bowl or
plates. Roughly mix ricotta cheese, butter, walnut oil, 1/4 cup
walnuts and grated Parmesan cheese. Thin with half-and-half, stir in
herbs and season with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to wide

mixture. Toss everything together well, then place in heated bowl.
Scatter remaining walnuts over pasta and sprinkle with grating of
Parmesan cheese and plenty of ground pepper.
