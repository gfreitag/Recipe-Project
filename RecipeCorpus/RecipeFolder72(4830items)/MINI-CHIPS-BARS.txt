Title: MINI CHIPS BARS
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt (opt)
3/4 c  Ff yogurt
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
2    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Mini-chips
make just like cookies- mix yogurt and sugar together, add egg
whites, then flour, etc.  I baked it at 350 deg. for about 25 minutes
or so. It turned brown really fast, so I tested it with a toothpick.
The only thing that has a considerable amount of fat in it should be
the mini chocolate chips, but that was kind of the point. I used a
rectangular cake pan, sprayed with pam and dusted with sugar (that's
what we always did in my family). They are really chewy and kind of
hard to cut, because of the chewiness.
