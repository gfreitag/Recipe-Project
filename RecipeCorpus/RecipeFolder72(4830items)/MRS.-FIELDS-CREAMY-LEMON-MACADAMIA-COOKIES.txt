Categories: Cookies, Mrs.fields
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Light brown sugar, packed
1/2 c  White sugar
1/2 c  Salted butter, softened
4 oz Cream cheese, softened

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

2. In a medium bowl combine flour, soda and salt.  Mix well with wire
whisk and set aside.

3. In a large bowl blend sugars well with an electric mixer set at
medium speed.  Add the butter and cream cheese, and mix to form a
smooth paste. Add the egg and lemon extract, and beat at medium speed
until light and soft.  Scrape down sides of bowl occasionally.

4. Add the flour mixture and macadamia nuts.  Blend at low speed just
until combined.  Do not overmix.

5. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased cookie sheets, 2 inches
apart.

6.  Bake 23 to 25 minutes.  Immediately transfer cookies with spatula
to a cool flat surface.

***** NOTE: If your oven temperature is off, as in too high, and you
don't realize it, these cookies will be hard instead of soft and
chewy. Reduce baking time accordingly.
