Title: NEW MEXICO TAMALES
Categories: Southwest, Pork
Yield: 48 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------TAMALES-------------------------------
4 lb Pork shoulder
6 c  Water
6 tb To 8 chile powder
1/8 ts Oregano (optional)
1/4 ts Cumin (optional)
2 cl Garlic, chopped fine
MMMMM----------------------MASA FOR TAMALES---------------------------
5 lb Masa corn meal flour
1 lb Lard
Pork broth from above
48    Corn husks(dried)
Tamales: Boil meat in water until tender. Remove meat from broth,
saving broth for making dough and chile. Chop meat in 1/4 inch pieces
and place in pan. Disolve chile powder in 1 1/2 cups of the meat
broth, add to the meat, add garlic, spices and salt, and cook until
almost dry. Set aside, while preparing dough (masa).

Masa for Tamales: Cream lard in a medium size mixing bowl, using a
mixer at medium speed.  Add flour and mix. Add enough of the meat
broth to make dough spreadable with a table knife.

Assembling the Tamales: Rinse corn husks and soak in warm water until
pliable.  Spread the center portion of each husk with 2 tb of the masa
mixture. Top with the chile meat filling. Varied amounts of either
the masa or thee filling may be used (some like them thin, some like
more of the filling).  Fold the sides of the hushs toward the center,
the bottom of the husk up the top down. Tie each tamale top and
bottom with a narrow corn husk strip.

Pour 2 inches of water in a large kettle and arrange the tamales on a
rack above water level.  Steam tamales for about 40 minutes. WALT
