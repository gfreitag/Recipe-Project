Title: NEW YORK CLAM CHOWDER
Categories: Soups, Clams
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Dozen large hard clams,
-chopped, and juice
1/4 lb Salt pork, chopped (**or
-bacon)
1    Onion, chopped
1 c  Cubed potatoes
1    Carrot, sliced
16 oz Can tomatoes
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
1/4 ts Pepper
2 c  Hot water (**clam juice
-makes it better)
1 ts Thyme
Brown pork: add onion and, when yellow, add potatoes, carrots, canned
whole tomatoes and salt, pepper and water. Boil until potatoes and
carrots are done.  Add clams, thyme, and juice. Serves 6.

**My notes:  I use celery too sometimes.  The amounts don't really
matter. I use lots of my home canned tomatoes, sometimes even fresh.
The tomatoes and thyme along with lots of clams are what makes it
taste right.
