Title: MRS. PETTIGREW'S LEMON CAKE (GFDM86A)
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
2    Lemons
3/4 c  Sugar
8 tb (1 stick) soft butter
2    Large eggs, beaten
3/4 c  Flour
6 tb Milk
3 tb Sugar, for topping
Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease and line a 7 inch round cake pan or 8
inch loaf pan with parchment or wax paper. Grate the lemon rinds and
set aside. Combine the juice of 1 lemon with 3 T sugar in bowl and
set in a warm place until the sugar dissolves and forms a syrup with
the juice. Cream the margarine and the rest of the sugar together
until light and fluffy. Add the beaten eggs, a little at a time,
beating well after each addition. Stir in the grated lemon rind and
flour then beat again thoroughly (the longer you beat, the softer the
cake). Add the milk and beat again. Pour into the prepared pan and
bake for at least 1 hour. The cake should spring back when pressed
gently in the center. Immediately upon removing the cake from the
oven, prick the top with a long-tined fork or thin skewer and pour
the lemon juice-sugar syrup all over the top until completely
covered. Cool the pan to allow the syrup to be soaked up and create a
moist and tangy cake. Annette Thompson.
