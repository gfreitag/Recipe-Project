1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper

MMMMM--------------------------CIMA MIX-------------------------------
1/2 c  Finely chopped onions
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Whole wheat bread crumbs
1/4 lb Ground seitan
1/4 lb Fine soy grits
1/4 lb Hand crushed frim tofu
1/3 c  Nutritional yeast
2 ts Dried marjoram
2 ts Dried thyme
2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Chopped spinach, packed
1/4 c  Chopped roasted red pepper
1/2 c  Pistachios
1 c  Green peas
1 tb Agar flakes
1/2 c  Gluten flour
2 tb Liquid lecithin
Rinse tofu and pat dry.  Cube and puree in food processor with all
ingredients except cima mix.

Shape the cima mix into a 12" by 3" roll.  Sread the tofu puree on a
12" by 28" piece of plastic wrap and roll around the cima log. Smooth
out the seam. Steam 30 minutes, let cool 10 minutes, slice and serve.

Note:  you MUST have a steamer wide enough to support the entire roll
from underneath!  If you don't, it will slip and come unrolled. It'll
still get cooked, but rather than a pretty, colorful roll to slice
you'll have a serious mess.  This shouldn't be a problem, but for a
broke person cooking for nine @someone else's apartment, these
harware problems have a nasty way of only becoming apparently an hour
before mealtime. (sigh)

CIMA MIX: (makes 4 1/2C  Bro Ron suggests using the extra for
'meatballs' or something.  Far be it from me to argue w/my hero, but
remember to use a big enough skillet.)

Saute onions in oil until translucent.  Remove from heat. Add bread
crumbs, tofu, seitan, soy grits, nut yeast, water and seasoning. Mix
until evenly dispersed. Add vegs and nuts.

In a separate bowl, mix agar and gluten flour.  Heat lecithin and
stir into veg mixture, then stir in flour/agar mixture.
