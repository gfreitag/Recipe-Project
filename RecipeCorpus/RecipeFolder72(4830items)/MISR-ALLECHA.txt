Misr Allecha is a spiced red lentil puree.

Soak lentils for one hour.  Cook for 1/2 hour.  Drain. Mash and set
aside.

In dry pan over moderate low heat, stir fry the onion and garlic for 2
minutes.  Add the oil and stir fry for 1 minute more.

Add the mashed lentils, tumeric, salt and chili.  Mix well. Add the
water and cook for 3-4 mins longer to reduce the mixture to a thick,
red, well spiced puree.

Serve warm with Injeera.
