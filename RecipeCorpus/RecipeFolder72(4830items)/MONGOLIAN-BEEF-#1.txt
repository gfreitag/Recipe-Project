Categories: Chinese, Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Peanut Oil
15    Green Onion Tops
1 tb Minced Ginger
1 lb Flank Or Sirloin Steak
1 1/2 tb Water Chestnut Flour
2    Egg Whites
1 pn Salt
1    Cornstarch Paste
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 ts Chili Paste With Garlic
1/4 c  Chicken Stock
2 tb Dark Soy Sauce
1 pn Sugar
1 1/2 tb Dry Sherry
Preparation:  Cut tops of green onions into 2" long pieces. Combine
sauce ingredients in small bowl & stir thoroughly. Cut steak across
the grain into thin slices, about 1/2" deep by 2" long. In bowl big
enough to hold meat, combine egg whites, salt & water chestnut flour.
Beat with chopstick until frothy. Add steak, & use fingers to coat
each slice. Deep-frying: In wok, heat oil to moderately hot.  When
ready, piece of coated meat will rise to surface immediately. Fry
meat in small batches; drop in 1 slice at a time to avoid sticking.
Cook until lightly brown, about 1 minute. Drain on Chinese strainer
or paper bag. Stir-frying: Remove all but 2 T of oil from wok. With
wok at medium heat, quickly stir-fry green onions & ginger for about
20 seconds.  Add sauce; bring to boil on high heat while stirring.
Add beef all at once, & toss with sauce until beef is hot & coated.
Push beef out of sauce, dribble in cornstarch paste to lightly
thicken.  Recombine.  Serve immediately.
