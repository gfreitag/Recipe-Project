Title: MUSTARD MARINADE
Categories: Marinade
Yield: 1 Recipe
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Finely chopped green onion
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped garlic
1 c  Dijon style mustard
2/3 c  Olive oil
2 tb Brown sugar (or to taste)
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
Great with chicken, pork and meaty fish such as halibut or salmon.
Recommended wines: Mustard mellows as it cooks and this marinade works
deliciously with Sundial Chardonnay, Barrel Select Sauvignon Blanc and
Barrel Select Pinot Noir. In a food processor or blender, add wine,
onion and garlic and puree in 3 or 4 short bursts. Stir wine mixture
into remaining ingredients and adjust to taste. Store covered in
refrigerator up to 1 week.
