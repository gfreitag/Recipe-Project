Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 lb White mushrooms
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped shallots
2 ts Finely chopped garlic
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper,
-to taste
1/3 c  Coarsely chopped flat-leaf

2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
12 oz Butterfly or bow-tie pasta,
-uncooked
Coarsely grated Parmesan

For a delicate dinner or lunch pasta, try my mushroom sauce tossed
with bow-tie or butterfly shapes. Try to use extra-virgin olive oil
for flavor when cooking this dish, since there are so few
ingredients. It's not necessary to season the pasta with salt if
using Parmesan cheese, as it's a bit salty. And if you opt for the
Parmesan, freshly grated is a must!

1. Trim mushroom stems and wipe caps clean with a paper towel. Slice
lengthwise.

2. Toss mushrooms, shallots and garlic with oil in a large, heavy
saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, for 10 minutes.
Season with pepper. Toss in 1/3 cup parsley and lemon zest. Cook 1
minute longer. Reserve, covered, on the stove.

3. Shortly before serving, cook the pasta in boiling, salted water,
stirring once, 6-8 minutes or until AL DENTE. Drain, reserving 2
tablespoons of the cooking liquid. Toss pasta with mushrooms and
reserved liquid; then toss with Parmesan and serve immediately, or
serve the cheese alongside. Garnish with remaining tablespoon of
chopped parsley.
