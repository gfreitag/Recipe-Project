Title: MOCK CHOPPED LIVER
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Dried Lentils;
- cooked until soft, drain.
1 lb Green beans
- boiled or steamed until
- cooked, but not mushy
1/4 c  Peanuts (or more)
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
2 c  Diced onions; sauteed in oil
- until very soft
- and turning brown
2    Garlic cloves (or more)
- (saute with the onions)
1/4 c  Unsweetened peanut butter
- (like Laura Scudders)
- optional
Salt & pepper to taste
Spike seasoning
- (if you have it)
Blend it all in the food processor until smooth.  I do everything
separately, then mix it all together because my food processor is not
big enough to do it all at once. Serve as a sandwich spread, or on
crackers.
