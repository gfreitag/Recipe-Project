Title: MOROCCAN CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Chickens, quartered
2 lb Chopped onions (NOT A TYPO!)
9 oz Raisins
3 oz Pine nuts
1/2 c  Honey
Paprika
Salt
Cloves
Salt and paprika chickens. Brown in oil. In another skillet, saute
onions until clear. Add raisins, cloves, and pine nuts; saute a few
minutes more. Remove from heat and add honey. Adjust seasonings to
taste. Place chicken in baking dish, cover with mixture and bake at
325F for 1 hour or until nicely browned and tender. This recipe came
from a Moroccan restaurant in the old quarter of Jerusalem. The
owners generously gave us this recipe at our request -- in a mixture
of Hebrew and Arabic with metric measurements. Many people
contributed to the translation, and the result is worth their
efforts. So to be faithful, you should actually use 2.2 pounds of
onions -- 1 kilo!
