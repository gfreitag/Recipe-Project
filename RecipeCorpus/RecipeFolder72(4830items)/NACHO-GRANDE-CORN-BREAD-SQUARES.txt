Cornbread Twists Is anyone out there like me? I love the Bake-off
cookbooks published every year after the contest is over. This year's
had some great recipes in it and I will post two for those who didnt
get the book. This on is from Linda Sue Burlingame AND IS WONDERFUL .
Heat oven to 350, grease 13x9 pan: sprinkle with cornmeal. Unroll
dough. Press into bottom and 1/4 inch up sides of pan to form crust;
firmly press perforations to seal. Bake for 14-19 minutes or until
golden brown. Remove. Increase oven temp. to 400. Meanwhile in small
bowl mash beans with fork, stir in reserved bean liquid and chili
powder, mix well. Spread evenly over baked crust. Top with mushrooms,
tomatoes and jalapeno pepper slices. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at
400 for 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese melts. Cut squares and top
each with sour cream, green onions and sliced olives. Serves 6 or
makes 12 appetizers.
Enjoy
