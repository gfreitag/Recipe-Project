Title: MEXICAN DINNER
Categories: Main dish, Mexican
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Recipe refried beans
1    Recipe herbed rice
1    Recipe enchilada filling
1    Recipe uncooked salsa
2 c  Grated cheese
4    Corn tortillas
First make the refried beans, herbed rice, and salsa. Prepare the
enchilada filling.  In a medium frying pan, melt butter, soft-fry
each corn tortilla in the butter by cooking it on one side until it
starts to get limp, then turn it over and fry another second or two.
Roll 1/2 c filling inside each tortilla.  Store filled tortillas on a
plate, covered with a plastic bag, in the refrigerator until you are
ready to serve dinner. When ready to serve, place 1 rolled enchilada
on each plate, cover with about 1/2 c salsa, being careful to cover
the ends of the enchilada so they don't dry out during baking.
Arrange 1/2 c herbed rice and 1/2 c refried beans next to the
enchilada. Sprinkle it with 1/2 c grated cheese. Bake in preheated
350 degree oven for 15-20 min, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Serve immediately.  A dollop of sour cream and a few black olives are
excellent additions to each plate. ~--
