Preheat oven to 375F. Line cookie sheets with waxed paper.

In a double boiler, melt the unsweetened chocolate and the first
batch of chocolate chips. Stir frequently with a wooden spoon or wire
whisk until creamy and smooth. Pour melted chocolate into a large
bowl. Add butter and beat with electric mixer at medium speed until
thoroughly combined. Add the sugar, eggs and vanilla. Beat on medium
speed until well blended. Scape down the sides of the bowl. Add the
flour and the three types of chocolate chips. Mix at low speed just
until combined. Chips should be distributed equally throughout the
dough.

Roll a heaping tablespoon of dough into a ball, about 1 1/2 inches in
diameter. Place dough balls onto paper-lined pans, 2 inches apart.
With the palm of your hand, flatten each bal to 1/2-inch thickness.
Bake for 10-12 minutes. Transfer with a spatula to a cool, flat
surface like your countertop.
