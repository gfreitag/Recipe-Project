Cook peppers in a moderate oven or directly over a gas flame. Turn
frequently to ensure even cooking on all sides. When the skins are
charred & black, they are done. To peel, place peppers immediately
into a plastic bag & seal closed, cover with a towel & let stand for
30 minutes. Peel off the skins & rinse in cold water, pat dry. Cut
off the tops & remove seeds. Cut lengthwise into 4 or 5 pieces &
arrange on a serving dish.

Combine the rest of the ingredients, pour over peppers & refrigerate
for several hours.  Serve at room temperature.
