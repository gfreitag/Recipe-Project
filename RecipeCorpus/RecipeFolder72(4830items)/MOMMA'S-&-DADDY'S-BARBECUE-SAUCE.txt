Title: MOMMA'S & DADDY'S BARBECUE SAUCE
Categories: Bbq sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1    #10 can
12 c  Water
6 ts Celery salt
1    Head garlic -- peeled and
Crushed
6 ts Salt
2 ts Ground black pepper
1 ts Louisiana Hot sauce
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Worcestershire sauce
6 tb Fresh lemon juice
Zest from the lemons
3 tb Apple cider vinegar
Catsup -- (about 12 cups)
Combine ingredients, stirring to blend.  Simmer for about an hour
before using or canning to allow it to thicken. Charcoal broil or
cook in a pit meat or chicken until done. Cover with sauce and keep
warm until ready to serve.  Is best if meat can marinate for at least
30 minutes before serving.

Note:  You can get pretty comparable results from a Weber grill and
mesquite chips, as Bill's Barbecue was always smoked with mequite.
Daddy always said that you had to use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire
Sauce -- other brands made the sauce taste funny. This recipe made my
parents a fine living for many years before they retired, in the
highly competitive world of Texas Barbecue. Rosilyn H. Overton
