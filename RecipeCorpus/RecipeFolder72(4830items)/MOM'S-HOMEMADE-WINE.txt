Categories: Alcohol, Beverage
Yield: 1 Gallon
2    12oz cans Frozen Grape Juice
4 c  Sugar

Dissolve yeast in 1 cup of warm water.  Mix all other ingredients
together in the gallon jug.  Pour yeast/water mixture into jug. Fill
jug halfway full with warm water. Shake well to mix ingredients and
disolve sugar. Fill the jug to the lower neck with water. Put a toy
balloon on the neck of the jug. Poke a small hole in the balloon with

the balloon starts to deflate the wine is finished.  Do not move the
jug while fermenting.
This recipe came from my great grand mother in Germany. It was
:
passed on by my grandmother, to mother, then me. I hope that you
enjoy it. It is a little potent for wine!
