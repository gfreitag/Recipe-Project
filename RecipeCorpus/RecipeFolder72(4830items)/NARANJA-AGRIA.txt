Naranja Agria is used in Latin American cooking. Elisabeth Lambert
Ortiz in her "Book of Latin American Cooking" suggests one third
lemon or lime juice to two thirds sweet orange as a substitute. You
could also use 1 teaspoon cider vinegar to 3 Tablespoons sweet orange
juice. The naranja agria is actually the juice of a Seville orange.
Most of the Seville oranges are shipped to England for the marmalade.
The Seville orange has a sour bite.
