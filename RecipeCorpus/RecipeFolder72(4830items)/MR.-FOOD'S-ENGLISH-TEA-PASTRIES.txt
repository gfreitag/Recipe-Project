Title: MR. FOOD'S ENGLISH TEA PASTRIES
Categories: Desserts, Pastry
Yield: 16 Servings
8 oz Refrigerator crescent rolls
- (eight rolls per package)
3 tb Strawberry or raspberry
- fruit preserves or jam
1 tb Butter, melted
1 tb Chopped blanched almonds
1 tb Confectioners' sugar
=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Seperate the
crescent rolls into individual triangles. Cut each triangle in half
lengthwise, making 16 long triangles. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of
preserves over each triangle. Roll each triangle from the wide end to
the point, NOTE: These are quick throw-together treats that are
perfect for dunking in tea - and coffee, too. And remember, make as
many as you need by using more packages of crescent rolls (and
everything else, too!).
