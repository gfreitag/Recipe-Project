MMMMM----------------------------RICE---------------------------------
2 c  Water
1 c  Rice
1 1/2 ts Salt
Rice:  I cook mine in the microwave for 18 minutes, in a covered 2 qt
corning dish. Sauce: In a small bowl, mix half the stock with soy
sauce, sugar and pepper.  In a separate bowl, combine remaining stock
and cornstarch. Set aside.  (I use 1 pk bovril chicken with 1/2 cup
water) Stir Fry: Dice chicken (or pork or beef), mushrooms, cabbage,
and water Chestnuts into 1/4 inch cubes.  Keep chicken separate.
String and trim peas.  Combine diced vegetables, snow peas, bamboo
shoots and celery. I often vary my ingredients.  I use as
alternatives or additions, kale, sun chokes, jicama, or any other
ingredient you like. Heat wok over high heat til drop of water
sizzles into steam. Add oil, ( only use about 1 tbsp) heat and add
almonds; stir fry for about 2 min or til just golden. With slotted
spoon, remove almonds and set aside. Reheat oil and add ginger and
garlic and stir fry 30 seconds. Remove ginger and garlic and discard.
Add chicken.  Stir fry for 2 minutes. Add all vegetables and toss to
coat with oil. Stir fry for 30 seconds. Add soy sauce mix. Cover and
steam for 2 minutes or til vegetables are tender but crisp and
chicken cooked through. Stir cornstarch mix and pour into wok.  Stir
fry uncovered for 30 seconds or til ingredients are glazed. Transfer
to heated platter and serve topped with almonds.  Serve over rice.
