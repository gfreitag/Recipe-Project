rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough
down and let rise again until doubled. (1 hour more).  Divide dough
in half. Shape pretzel as follows: Roll dough into a rope about 30
inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Cross the ends leaving a
large loop in the center. Flip loop back onto crossed ends to form a
pretzel. Repeat with remaining dough. Place pretzels on greased
baking sheets.  Let rise 15 minutes more. Bake at 375 degrees F for
25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Mix
confectioners' sugar, water and vanilla to form a thin icing. Spread
icing on pretzels and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Makes 2 large
pretzels.
