Bring 4 qts of salted water to a boil in a large pot for cooking the
vegetables and noodles.  Snap the ends off the beans. If using long
beans, cut them into 3-inch pieces. Cook the beans in the boiling
water until crisp-tender, about 2 min. Transfer the beans to a
colander with a slotted spoon, rinse with ice water, and drain again.
Cook, drain, and chill the carrots the same way.  Add the noodles to
the boiling water and cook until tender, 6-8 min. Drain the noodles
in a colander, rinse with cold water, and drain again.  Pure the
garlic, shallots, ginger, and chilies in a food processor. Heat the
oil in a non-stick wok or frying pan. Add the garlic paste and
stir-fry until fragrant, about 2 min. Stir in the coconut milk,
stock, fish sauce, and pepper. Boil the mixture until slightly
thickened and very flavorful, about 2 min.  Stir in the noodles and
simmer until most of the sauce is absorbed, 2-3 min. Stir in the
beans and carrots and cook until heated. Correct the seasoning,
adding fish sauce or pepper to taste. Sprinkle the noodles with the
scallion greens and serve at once.
