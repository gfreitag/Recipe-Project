Title: MOLASSES BRAN BREAD & VARIATIONS
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Soda
1/2 c  Blackstrap molasses
1 1/2 c  Sour milk or buttermilk
(skim)
1 1/2 c  Bran
1/2 c  Raisins
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
Dissolve soda in molasses, add sour milk and mix well. Mix in bran and
raisins.  Gradually fold in flour; turn into an 8x4x2 inch loaf pan
greased or lined with wax paper, and spread evenly. Bake 45 minutes
in a moderate oven (350 deg. F)

My variations: I substitute 3/4 cup skim milk + 3/4 cup skim yogurt
for the buttermilk.  I substitute 1 1/2 cups oatmeal for the bran.
Last time I made this, I also added 2 grated carrots, and had nice
carrot cake. I also plump the raisins in the microwave with some
water.
