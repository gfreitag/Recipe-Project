Title: MOM'S DUCKLING A LA ORANGE
Categories: Duck, Mom
Yield: 1 Duck
Duck
Orange marmalade
Orange juice concentrate
1 tb Cornstarch
Water
Turn duck upside-down and prick through the skin into the fat all
over the bottom of the duck so the fat will drain. Preheat oven to
350 degrees F. Bake the duck in a little water around 30 minutes.
(Grab a leg; if it moves, it is tender enough.)  Keep duck covered
with foil, but baste often.

Make the glaze of equal parts marmalade and orange juice concentrate,
thawed.  Can add a little sugar to make it stick better; glaze is
prettier if you add about 1 T cornstarch dissolved in a little water.
