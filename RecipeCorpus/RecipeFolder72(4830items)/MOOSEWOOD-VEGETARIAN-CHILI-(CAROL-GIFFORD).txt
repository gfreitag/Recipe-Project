2 1/2 c  Raw kidney beans
6 c  + water
1 ts Salt
1 c  Tomato juice
1 c  Raw bulghar
Olive oil for saute
4    Cloves crushed garlic
1 1/2 c  Chopped onion

1 ds Of cayenne (to taste)
1 c  Chopped green peppers
2 c  Chopped fresh tomatoes
Juice of 1/2 lemon
3 ts Tomato paste
3 ts Dry red wine

Parsley
Put kidney beans in a saucepan and cover them with 6 cups of water.
Soak 3 4 hours.  Add extra water and salt. Cook until tender (about 1
hour). Watch the water level, and add more if necessary.

Heat tomato juice to a boil.  Pour over raw bulghar. Cover and let
stand at least 15 minutes.  (It will be crunchy, so it can absorb
more later.) Saute onions and garlic in olive oil. Add carrots,
celery and spices. When vegetables are almost done, add peppers. Cook
until tender. Combine beans, bulghar, sauted vegetables, tomatoes,
lemon juice, tomato paste, and wine and heat together gently, either
in kettle over double boiler, or covered in a moderate oven.

Serve topped with cheese & parsley.
