1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Shortening
2 ts Salt
1 c  Water, cold
2 tb Yeast
6 1/2 c  Flour to 7 cups
Heat 1 1/2 cup water and other ingredient til hot. Add cold water. In
a large bowl, mix 4 cups flour and yeast. Add warm liquid. Beat 2
minutes. Add 3 cups more flour gradually until proper consistency is
reached. Knead 3 minutes with dough hook.  Let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hour.
Make into 2 loaves. Rise again.  Bake at 350 35-40 minutes. 1 cup

the same with whole wheat or other types.
