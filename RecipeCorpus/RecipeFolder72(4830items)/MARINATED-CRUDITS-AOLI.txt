Title: MARINATED CRUDITS AOLI
Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers
Yield: 2 Servings
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE MARINADE---------------------------
300 ml White wine
300 ml Water
1    Bay leaf
1    Sprig thyme
150 ml Olive oil
1    Lemon; Juiced and grated
2 tb White-wine vinegar
4    Coriander seeds
4    Peppercorns
1/2    Dried chilli
-- soaked in warm water
15 g  Fresh root ginger
- (peeled and grated)
1    Garlic clove; chopped
Salt
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE AOLI----------------------------
2 lg Garlic cloves; crushed
300 ml Mayonnaise
MMMMM----------------------VARIOUS CRUDITS---------------------------
*Lightly steamed: baby French beans, mange-tout, broccoli florets,
baby sweetcorn, 750 g (1 1/2  lb) Raw: yellow peppers, baby carrots,
cauliflower florets, button mushrooms

For all its simplicity, aoli always makes a memorable meal - thick,
glossy mayonnaise, uncompromisingly garlicky, and aromatic vegetables
to dip into it. Serve this with warm granary bread and the dish is
complete.

Boil all the ingredients for the marinade together for 5 minutes.
Pour over the prepared crudits and refrigerate for 24 hours.

To make the aoli, stir the crushed garlic into the mayonnaise and mix
well. Cover and leave to stand for at least an hour, preferably
longer, before using.

Most of the vegetables used for the crudits can be eaten whole, but
slice the peppers into thin strips before serving.
