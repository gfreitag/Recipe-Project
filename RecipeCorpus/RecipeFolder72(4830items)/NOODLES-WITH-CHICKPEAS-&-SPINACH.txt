Categories: Pasta, Ww
Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
6 oz Lasagna noodles
1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon olive oil
3    Cloves garlic; minced
1/4 ts Dried oregano
12 oz Spinach leaves; stemmed
8 oz Canned chickpeas; rinsed
-and drained
3/4 c  Reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 oz Parmesan cheese; grated
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Break the lasagna noodles into
smallish pieces.  Add the broken lasagna noodles to the boiling water
and cook until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain in a colander.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil
until hot but not smoking.  Add the garlic and oregano and cook,
stirring constantly, until the garlic just starts to brown, about 30
seconds. Add the spinach and toss with two spoons to coat well with
the oil. Cook just until wilted, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the chickpeas and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to medium-low and simmer until the chickpeas are heated through,
about 3 minutes.

Add the drained pasta to the skillet, season with the pepper and
salt, and toss to warm through.  Transfer to a serving bowl, top with
the Parmesan, and serve. Serving size 1-1/2 cups.

DO AHEAD STEPS:  Stem the spinach, rinse and drain the chickpeas, and
grate the Parmesan ahead of time.
