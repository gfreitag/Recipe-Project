Preparation :
: Quick and Easy  *May use 1 green pepper, red adds color. Oven at 350
degrees.  1.  Saute onion and peppers and cook about 5 minutes,
uncovered. Add tomatoes, corn and marjoram, raise heat and cook
uncovered 5 minutes longer.  Pour into 1 1/2 quart casserole. 2. In
same skillet cook pork chops 2 minutes on each side. Lay chops on top
of vegetable mixture. 3. Cover with foil and bake 12-15 minutes or
until chops are done. Studies say that pork (chops, butterfly and
center) are equal to chicken in fat content if trimmed of all fat.
You be the judge. I'm very careful and seldom serve pork, but is nice
for a change which won't hurt you if you serve in moderation.
