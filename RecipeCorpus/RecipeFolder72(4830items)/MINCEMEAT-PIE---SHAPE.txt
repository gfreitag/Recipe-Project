Nonstick cooking spray
5    Sheets phyllo dough
18 oz Mincemeat -- 2 cups

To make the top pie crust, spray 2 sheets of phyllo dough with
nonstick cooking spray; stack sheets and cut the stack in half to
make 4 sheets. Stack the 4 sheets and place a pieplate on top to
score a circle the size of the bottom of the plate; trim off excess
dough. Use decorative cookie cutter to cut out a stencil in the
center. Set top crust aside and cover with a damp towel (always do
this when working with phyllo dough).

To make the bottom crust, stack the remaining 3 sheets, cut stack to
make 6 sheets.  Lay one sheet on the pie plate and spray with cooking
spray. Repeat with remaining sheets layering clockwise to cover
entire pie plate. Trim off excess dough. Bake 8-10 min or til lightly
golden. Let cool for 5 min.

Filling: Combine mincemeat, walnuts, apples, brown sugar and rum
extract in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer; cover. Cook 10 min or until
apples are tender, stirring occasionally. Pour filling into prepared
bottom crust and cover with prepared top crust. Bake at 350F for
10-15min or until golden.
