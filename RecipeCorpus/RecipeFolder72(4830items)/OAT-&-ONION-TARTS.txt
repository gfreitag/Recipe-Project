Title: OAT & ONION TARTS
Categories: British, Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE PASTRY----------------------------
5 oz Oat flakes (rolled oats)*
2 1/2 oz Whole meal flour
2 1/2 oz Plain white flour
2 1/2 oz Butter
2 1/2 oz Lard
2 1/2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
1 pn Salt
1 pn Paprika
1 pn Cayenne pepper
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
1 lb Onions
Salt and pepper; to taste
1 ds Each cayenne and paprika
1/4 pt Sour cream
2 1/2 oz Butter
2 1/2 oz Cheddar cheese
1    Whole egg + 1 egg yolk
*Note: Medium oatmeal may be used instead of oat flakes if preferred.

Mix the oats, flours, cheese and the salt, paprika and cayenne. Cut
then rub in the fat, bind with water and leave out to rest.

Peel, quarter and slice the onions wafer thin.  Turn them in melted
butter, cover and leave to sweat over very gentle heat for 20 minutes
or so until meltingly tender, just stirring occasionally.

This pastry is rather difficult to handle so it is best to divide it
in half and roll out in two batches. Keep the other half covered
meanwhile. Use the pastry to line little mincepie tins (or individual
4 " fluted flan tins if you prefer).  Don't worry too much if the
pastry tears; patch it together by pressing it with your fingertips.

Bake on a pre-heated baking sheet at 400 F., allowing 12 minutes with
greaseproof paper and beans, then 12 minutes without the lining.

When the onions are beautifully soft, remove the lid and cook over
increased heat for several minutes until they are a rich golden brown.
Season generously with salt and pepper, add dashes of cayenne and
paprika and mix well. Then tip the contents of the pan into a sieve
placed over a bowl to drain off the buttery juices and to cool the
onions slightly.

When pastry cases are cooked, beat the eggs with the soured cream, add
onions and check seasoning.  Spoon the mixture into the tarts,
sprinkle the grated cheese on top and bake at 400 F. for 20-25
minutes, until the filling is deliciously puffed up and golden.
