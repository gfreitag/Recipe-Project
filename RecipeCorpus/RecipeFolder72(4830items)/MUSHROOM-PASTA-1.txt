Title: MUSHROOM PASTA 1
Categories: Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 c  Flour
1 ea Pinch of salt
4 ea Eggs
2 tb Oil
1 tb Butter; unsalted
1 ea Shallot, minced
1/4 lb Mushrooms, fresh shiitake sl
1/4 lb Mushrooms, fresh oyster slic
2 tb Wine, port
1/2 c  Whipping cream
1 x  Salt & freshly ground black
1/2 c  Chicken stock (part 2)
Place flour & salt in the workbowl of a food processor. Add eggs, 2
tbs. water, and the oil. Process until dough begins to form a ball.
Remove dough and wrap securely in plastic wrap. Let the wrapped dough
rest 10 min. at room temp. (Be sure to refrigerate, if not intending
to use in the next 2 hrs. For best results, pasta should be used
within 24 hrs.) When rested, divide into four portions and knead each
through a pasta machine about 4 times, or until smooth and elastic.
Roll out the portions of kneaded dough to 1/16-in. thickness. Cut
into 1/4 in. strips. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy saucepan. Add the shallot and
sliced mushrooms and saute until golden. Add the port and stir to
deglaze pan.  Add Chicken Stock and cream and reduce until thickened.
