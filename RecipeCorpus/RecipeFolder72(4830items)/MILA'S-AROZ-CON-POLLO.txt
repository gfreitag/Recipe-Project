Shrimp can also be added.

Adding the rice to just coat with a tiny bit of oil.

Add the beer, tomatoes, turmeric, saffron, turmeric, food coloring
(if you use it) And bring this to heat. Add the drained chicken,
cover and simmer on very low heat until the rice is cooked and
separate. Approximately 15 minutes.

Then add the drained jar of green olives, some frozen green peas (the
heat of the rice will cook them), and the pimentos.

If you increase the amount of rice just add chicken stock to cover
about 1 inch. Because it's so flexible this is a good company dish.
And very pretty.
