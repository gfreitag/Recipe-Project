Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 10 Servings
MMMMM------------------BUTTERMILK BISCUIT CRUST-----------------------
3 c  Self-rising cake flour
3/4 c  Unsalted butter
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 1/2 lb Peaches; peeled and sliced
3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
3 tb Unsalted butter
MMMMM-----------------------FOR FINISHING----------------------------
Buttermilk

FOR THE DOUGH, PLACE FLOUR in a bowl and rub in butter until fine and
mealy. Do not allow to become pasty. Stir in 1 cup of the buttermilk,
adding the remainder if necessary. Press dough together on a floured
surface, wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest while preparing
filling. Preheat the oven to 450F and set a rack in the middle level.
Place the peaches in a bowl and add the remaining filling
ingredients, except the butter. Toss well to combine and pour filling
into a 2-quart gratin dish or other baking dish. Distribute pieces of
the butter evenly on the filling. On a floured surface, with the
palms of the hands, press out the dough to the size of the baking
dish and slide a thin cookie sheet under it. Slide the dough onto the
filling. Cut 3 or 4 vent holes in the crust with the point of a
knife. Paint the top crust evenly with the buttermilk and sprinkle
with sugar. Bake the cobbler about 20 minutes, until crust is
well-colored and filling is bubbling. Cool slightly on a rack and
serve warm or at room temperature.
