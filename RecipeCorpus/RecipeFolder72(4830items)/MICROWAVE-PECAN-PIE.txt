Title: MICROWAVE PECAN PIE
Categories: Pies, Microwave
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 c  Butter
1 c  Light corn syrup
3    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Dark brown sugar
1 c  Pecan halves
In 1 quart glass measuring bowl (I use pyrex), melt 1/3 c butter,
usually 30 seconds on high. Stir in remaining ingredients. Pour into
baked pie crust shell. Cook on medium, 18 to 20 minutes. Turn once
during cooking.

Hints: White sugar is made by removing the molasses, so I simply
reverse the process to make my own brown sugar. Add as much or as
little molasses to your white sugar as you like. I do the same thing
to light corn syrup.
