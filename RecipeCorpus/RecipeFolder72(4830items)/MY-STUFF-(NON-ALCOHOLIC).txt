Title: MY STUFF (NON-ALCOHOLIC)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Big servin
1/2 md Onion, sliced
4 oz Mushrooms (sm can sliced)
-reserve liquid
1/4 lb Roughly of ground hamburg
1/2    Package of dry gravy mix
1/2 c  Mushroom liquid plus water
-some frozen green peas
6 oz RED Zinfandel (not white)
Dump onions, and beef into a large frying pan and cook until beef is
browned.  Make the mushroom liquid up to 1/2 cup with water, and add
to the pan.  Then add the mushrooms and the dry gravy powder.  Cook
and stir a little until it thickens some.  Cover with a large cover
and let sit on the magic burner, at about 180 F.   Just before eating
throw in a handfull of peas, for color.  (I used to 'brown' the
mushrooms with the hamburg, but Shirley says it was a waste of time.)

Go drink the wine at the computer, watch the news, etc..  When ready
to eat (My Stuff was ready at the end of the last paragraph), make a
serving of instant potatoes and three slices of nice brown toast. Put
the potatoes and two slices of toast on a big plate. Put about 2/3 to
3/4 of My Stuff on top.  Refill wine glass.

When the toast is gone, and the potatoes are about 2/3 gone, get the
last slice of toast and put the rest of My Stuff on the toast, and on
the potatoes to warm them up.

My Stuff can sit on the magic burner for hours if you want.  It just
gets better.  Remember to turn off the magic burner.
