Title: MIRACLE COBBLER
Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
2 tb Butter
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
Pinch of salt
Preheat oven 375 F. Melt the butter in a baking dish, allowing it to
cover the bottom and grease sides of dis. Mix remaining ingredints.
Batter will be thin. Pour into buttered dish, Over the batter spread
4 cups canned or fresh fruit. Bake in a moderate oven (375) about 45
minutes. The batter will rise through the fruit and form a brown
crust.

This recipe is vague on draining the fruit if canned, I would suggest
doing so, since the same amount of fresh fruit can be used also (
this contains no juice.)
