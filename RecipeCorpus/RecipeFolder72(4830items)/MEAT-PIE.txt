TOSS THE MEAT with the flour and set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet
over high heat until nearly smoking. Add the meat in batches and
without crowding, brown well on all sides. Remove pieces as they are
done and reserve on a plate. Discard the cooking fat and reduce heat
to low. Add onion, celery, turnip and carrot. Cover and cook for 10
minutes. Add the garlic and wine, raise the heat and cook, uncovered,
until the wine has reduced to almost nothing. Add the stock and
continue to cook until reduced by about 2/3. Add the peas to the
skillet and replace the meat and any juices that have collected on
the plate. Add the salt and sage. Place in refrigerator to chill for
30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375F. Line a 9-inch pie dish with
your pastry and pour in the meat, vegetable and sauce. Cover the top
of the pie with the rest of your pastry. Poke a few holes in the top
to allow steam to escape during baking. Brush lightly with egg. Place
in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Serve immediately.
