Omar Khayyam, whose paradise required only a book of verses, a loaf of
bread, and a jug of wine, might have suffered seriously from
malnutrition (along with the mysterious Thou, who sang beside him) if
the loaf were the bubble bread we are all familiar with. Although
this flabby loaf contains niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and a rich
assortment of mono- and diglycerides (ethoxylated and otherwise), it
is not especially rich in protien and fiber, two pillars of
contemporary sound diet.
=======================================================
==================
1. The night before, sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large (at
least 4-quart) bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Then add
granulated sugar and rye flour; beat to blend well. Cover bowl
tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature up to a
day (at least 12 hours). Stir in 5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, rolled
oats, brown sugar, and salt.
2. TO KNEAD BY HAND, scrape dough onto a board lightly coated with
all-purpose flour. Knead, adding flour as required to prevent
sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place
dough in a greased bowl, turn over to grease top, and cover with
plastic wrap.
3. TO KNEAD WITH A DOUGH HOOK, beat until dough pulls cleanly from
bowl. If dough still feels sticky, beat in flour, 1 tablespoon at a
time; remove dough hook and cover bowl with plastic wrap.
4. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch
down and divide into 3 equal portions. Shape each portion into a loaf
and set in a greasd 4x8" loaf pan. Cover loaves lightly and let rise
in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. With a sharp
knife or razor blade, slash top of each loaf in about 3 places,
making cuts about 1/8" deep. Brush tops lightly with water.
5. Bake in a 350'F. oven; after 10 minutes, brush tops lightly with
more water. Continue baking until loaves are well browned, about 40
minutes total. For a shiny finish, rub tops of hot loaves with soft
butter. Invert onto racks. Serve warm or cool. If loaves are made
ahead, cool and package airtight up to a day; freeze to store longer.
Make 3 loaves, each about 1
1/2    pounds.
