"We serve lavender ice cream every Plant Day to appreciative oohs and
ahs. We only recommend Nichols Northwest lavender oil, for we know it
to be of the highest purity. This novel easy dessert provides merry
entertainment as friends guess the flavor."

Mince ginger; if it is hard to handle, sprinkle with a little sugar.
Place slightly softened ice cream in the chilled bowl of a heavy duty
mixer or food processor with ginger and a single drop of lavender
oil. Mix until flavors are blended, taste and add an additional drop
if you want a more intense flavor. Place ice cream in covered
container and refreeze for at least one hour before serving.

ALTERNATIVE TO LAVENDER OIL: Add fresh lavender blossoms and sugar to
whipping cream. In a small saucepan slowly heat, not to boiling, but
hot to the touch. Remove from heat and allow to steep and cool for 15
minutes. Strain and chill and add to ice cream as described above.
