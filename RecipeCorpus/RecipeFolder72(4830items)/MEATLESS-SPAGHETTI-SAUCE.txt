Title: MEATLESS SPAGHETTI SAUCE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Onion
1    Garlic clove
1 tb Parsley Flakes
1 ts Basil
2 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Tomato
2/3 c  Tomato paste
Saute onion in a little olive oil until soft.  In medium saucepan,
combine onion with remaining ingredients and simmer uncovered until
thick, stirring occasionally (about 15-20 minutes).

I use this sauce in my family favorite....lasagna.  If at any time you
decide to add meat (it mixes in very well).....about 1 lb. of
hamburger does great! Remember to brown it first though before adding
remaining ingredients.
