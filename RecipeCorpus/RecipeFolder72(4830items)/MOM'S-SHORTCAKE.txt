Title: MOM'S SHORTCAKE
Categories: Desserts, Quick bread, Mom
Yield: 1 Batch
3 c  Flour
2/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
3 ts Baking powder
1 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Milk (more as needed)
Butter, melted
Strawberries, for serving
Mix flour, sugar, salt and baking powder.  Cut in "1 cup shortening
or so" until texture is like 1/2 cornmeal, 1/2 pea. Add milk
gradually till well-moistened (might need more, up to 3/4 cup,
depending on humidity). Gather into a ball (will look like not enough
liquid); loose flour will disappear into it.

Pat about 3/4" thick onto wax paper sprayed with Pam. Drizzle top with
melted butter; spread over dough. Fold dough in half cross-ways; cut
into diamonds and place cakes on greased, foil-lined baking pan or
cookie sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F. about 15 to 20 minutes; yields
approximately 1 dozen.

Serve with butter and/or sliced strawberries (with sugar added) and
whipped cream.
