Categories: Petfood
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Oats
1/2    Bananas, mashed
2 tb Plain yogurt
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4    Apple, chopped
2 oz Berries in season
Mix oats and bananas, blending well.  Add yogurt, orange juice and
apple immediately to prevent browning. Mash berries and add to
mixture. Serve in small portions (1 tablespoon per cat); too much
fruit can cause diarrhea in a digestive system that is not used to
it. Typed in MMFormat by cjhartlin@msn.com Source: Cat Treats
