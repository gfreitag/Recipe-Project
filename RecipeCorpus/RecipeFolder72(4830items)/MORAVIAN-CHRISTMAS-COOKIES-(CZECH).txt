Title: MORAVIAN CHRISTMAS COOKIES (CZECH)
Categories: Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Dark molasses
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Margarine
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Cloves
1 ts Ginger
1 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 tb Baking soda
4 c  Flour
Mix flour, sugar, butter, and spices together.  Heat molasses until
lukewarm and add baking soda to it. Add molasses to rest of
ingredients and mix well.  If necessary, add a little water to the
dough to get it to a soft enough consistency to roll it.  Roll the
dough on a well floured surface, making it as thin as humanly
possible. (Paper thin, if you can!) Cut into desired shapes, and
transfer to a non-stick cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 6 to 8
minutes.  If ya do it right, you'll end up with a delicately thin,
not too sweet, yummy spicy cookie. This recipe makes about 40,000
cookies <g>, so be prepared to eat lots of 'em!!
