2    Eggs; lightly beaten
1/2 c  Olive oil

Trim the crusts of the bread. Cut the cheese into pieces slightly
smaller than the bread. Place the cheese on 6 slices of the bread.
There should be a margin of no more than 1/8Â”. Cover with the
remaining 6 slices of bread and dip the sandwiches into the milk,
dredge them with flour and coat them with beaten egg. Heat the oil in
a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is quite hot,
brown the sandwiches in it until golden brown and crisp. Remove with
a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels and transfer to a heated
platter. Add the butter to the pan and reduce the heat to medium.
Quickly swirl in the garlic, then the anchovies and stir with a
wooden spoon for 1 minute. Add the lemon juice, blend well and pour
the sauce over the fried sandwiches. Serve immediately.
