Cut orange in half and squeeze juice. Reserve juice. Stick 6 cloves
into each half of the orange. Set aside.

Heat olive oil in the pressure cooker. Add garlic, onions, leeks.
Saute until leeks are wilted. Add celery, red pepper, carrots and
mushrooms. Saute for another couple of minutes over medium high heat.

Add stock, tomatoes, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, lentils, reserved
orange juice and orange halves. Make sure orange halves are buried in
the stew.

Lock lid in place, bring up to pressure. Cook for 11 minutes. Release
pressure. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over couscous.

*Note: make sure to wash the leeks well. Mud tends to get caught
inside them and there is nothing worse than girt in your stew.
