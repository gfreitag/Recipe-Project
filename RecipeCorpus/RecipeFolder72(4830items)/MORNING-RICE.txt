Title: MORNING RICE
Categories: Digest, Nov., Powter
Yield: 1 Servings  2 c. cooked brown rice 1/2 c. soy milk
2    tsp. honey
1    apple, chopped
1    tsp. cinnamon
2    Tbl. raisins

Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl.  Jam could be used in
place of honey, and any fruit you like.

I also added 1/4 cup crushed pineapple with some of it's natural
juice. I microwaved it for approx. 30 seconds, just to take the chill
off.

I think that's it for this week.  Have a wonderful holiday!
