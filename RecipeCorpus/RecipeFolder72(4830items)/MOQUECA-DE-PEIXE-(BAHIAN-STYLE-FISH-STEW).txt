1 tb Fresh lemon juice

*Heat a coconut in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes so it will develop
"fault lines. Remove from oven and, holding it in a cloth (it will be
hot) over a large bowl, hit it along the fault lines with a hammer or
heavy mallet. The coconut will open. Reserve the liquid, remove the
meat from the shell and take off the brown outer pieces with a
pairing knife. Grate the coconut meat, either with a hand grater or
in a food processor. Wrap in cheesecloth and pour 1/2 cup warm water
over it while holding it over a bowl. Squeeze the liquid from the
coconut into the bowl. This is thick coconut milk. Add the reserved
coconut water and grated coconut residue. This is the only way to get
the true Brazilian taste. Otherwise, you can buy a bottle of coconut
milk from specialty stores (and it is pretty hideous). African
markets in the United States. Chop the coriander, tomato, pepper, and
onion in a food processor until you have a coarse paste. Then place
the mixture in a large, heavy skillet over low heat. Add the salt and
pepper and cook for 15 minutes. Add the fish fillets to the mixture
and continue cooking for an additional 5 to 7 minutes. Add the
remaining ingredients, stir and allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Serve
the moqueca hot with white rice and Farofa.
