Categories: Loo, Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Each of eggplant,
-zucchini, tomato,
-onion
1    Head garlic
-[!maybe he means
-"clove," maybe not]
Salt
Ground peppercorns
Bouquet of thyme & laurel
-[5 sprigs thyme, 3 large
-bay leaves]
1 pt Olive oil
-[!maybe he means "cup"]
Deep cast-iron pan
With lid
Found - a recipe by one of the more famous musicians [flutists] in
this world [my annotations are in square brackets] - (pronounce
RATATOOY)

Preparation time 1/2 hour. Cooking time 3 hours.

Wipe (do not wash) vegetables. Slice eggplants lengthwise, salt and
brown. Set aside. Likewise with onions. Peel tomatoes after dipping
them in boiling water. Line pan with one layer of eggplant slices.
[Crush, chop, and saute the garlic. Sprinkle on ad lib between layers
~ the original recipe lists garlic as an ingredient but doesn't say
what to do with it, so I guess this is more or less right.] Then, in
layers, add sliced tomatoes, zucchini, onions (salt and pepper).
Halfway up add thyme and laurel bouquet, then again eggplant etc.
finishing with one layer of eggplant. Cover and cook very, very
slowly for 3 hrs without stirring. Upon serving, stir, remove
bouquet, and add one beaten raw egg [optional!].
