Categories: Mexico
Yield: 7 Servings
1    MJNT73C
14    Medium green zuchinni*
1 lb Ground beef/pork/veal comb.*
1/2 c  Raw Unconverted Rice*
1/2    Medium Red Tomato*
1/8 c  Water*
1/2    Small onion*
1    Garlic clove*
2 tb Dried Mint Leaves*
1/2 ts Salt*
1/2 ts Black pepper, ground*
2    Garlic Cloves
1    Small onion
4    Medium red tomatoes
2 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Dried mint leaves
5 c  Water
1    Small hot pepper
1/2    Juice of 1 lemon
Wash zuchinni and cut off tips.  Using a small sharp knife, scoop out
the insides.  Combine meat and rice in a large mixing bowl. In a
blender, combine 1/2 tomato, water, garlic clove, onion, mint , salt
& pepper and blend in a blender until smooth.  Mix with the meat and
rice mixture. Stuff mixture into the zuchinni and place in a pressure
cooker. Mix the remaining garlic, onion, tomato, salt, mint,
water,pepper, salt & Pepper & blend. Add to pressure cooker, along
with the dried mint. Cook in pressure cooker on low after pressure
rises to maximum allowed pressure and cook for 20 minutes.  Allow
pressure to release of its own accord. Add the juice of 1/2 lemon and
check for salt. Although I haven't tried it, I believe this could be
cooked in the oven in the same manner if the rice is cooked first.
Starred <*> ingredients are those used in the stuffing. The rest are
for the sauce.
