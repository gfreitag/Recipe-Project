Title: MARINATED SOUVLAKI
Categories: Lamb/mutton, Greek
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Tender meat (pork, veal,
-beef or lamb, or boned
-chicken or innards or fish
-fillet)
3 oz Onion, sliced
1 oz Carrot, sliced
1 oz Celery
2    Garlic clove; crushed
1 pn Thyme
1 pn Rosemary
1 pn Coriander
4 pn Or,gano
2 pn Cloves
4 pn Black pepper
1    Bay leaf
Parsley; chopped
Zest of 1/2 lemon
2 ts Salt
2 tb Lemon juice
3 oz Olive oil
4 oz Wine, white
Cut the meat into small cubes.  In a bowl, preferably earthenware,
mix the marinade ingredients well and add the meat, mix again, cover
and leave to marinate for 24 to 48 hours. (He doesn't say to
refrigerate but I would certainly do so.  For the curious, the recipe
actually calls for marinating in a *kioupi* or earthenware storage
jar rather than a bowl. This would probably keep the ingredients
cooler.) When ready to cook, thread the meat on 18 to 24 skewers.
Grill over embers of vine branches (!). Serve hot.
