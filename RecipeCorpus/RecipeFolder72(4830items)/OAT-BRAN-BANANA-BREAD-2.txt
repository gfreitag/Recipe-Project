Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Yeast
1 c  Rolled oats (quick cook)
1 1/2 c  Better for Bread Flour
2 1/4 c  Oat bran
1 3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
4 tb Gluten
2 tb Wheat germ
1 ts Salt (optional)
2 tb Safflower (or any
-vegetable) oil
2 tb Honey
2    Ripe medium bananas,
-sliced
2 c  Plus 2 Tbsp very warm
-water
Get ready for a 3-4 pound loaf. Place yeast in bottom of Auto Bakery.
Add rest of ingredients except liquid into the pan in the order
listed. Add 1 cup plus the 2 Tbsp of very warm water. Select white
bread and push "Start." Leave the lid open. After a minute as the
machine mixes the dough, add the remaining very warm water slowly.

This recipe is very large and may kick up some flour over the edge or
on the glass dome at the beginning. Adding the liquid slowly will
help prevent this. The pan will be very full and the bread won't rise
very much. But, it will be a tall loaf. If your rises too much, cut
down on the liquid. If it seems too dry, increase the liquid.

Note: Try adding 1/2 cup walnuts.
