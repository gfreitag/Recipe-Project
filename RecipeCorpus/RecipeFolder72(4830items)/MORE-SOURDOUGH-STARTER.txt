Title: MORE SOURDOUGH STARTER
Categories: Breads, Meats
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Water,
1 c  Sugar, and
1/2 c  Potato flakes.
Now the starters.  This is the starter that Connie used. After that
is an alternative for people who have trouble with the first one.

Potato starter I:

Mix the ingredients.  Cover loosely and leave in a warm place, such
as on top of a water heater, for 3 or 4 days. If the mixture starts
to smell yeasty prior to 3 or 4 days, or is ready. Go ahead and feed
it and start making bread.  See the feeding directions below. This is
from the "Panola COunty Heritage Cookbook".

For people who have trouble cultivating wild yeast, this is an
alternate starter recipe.

Potato starter II: 2 evelopes (2 TBSP) active dry yeast, 1/2 cup warm
water (105 to 115 F), 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 F), 2/3 cup sugar,
and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a medium mixing bowl.
Stir in 1 cup warm water, sugar, and potato flakes.

Let the mixture sit out all day, then refrigerate 10 to 15 days. (A
10 day schedule works fine.)  Remove from refrigerator and feed, see
the feeding instructions below.  Now you are ready to use 1 cup of
the starter to make bread.

Return the rest of the starter to the refrigerator for another 5 to 10
days.  Before making your next batch of bread, feed the starter again.

Now that we have a starter, we need to feed it.

Feeding Recipe: Starter from recipes above, 1 cup water, 3/4 cup
sugar, and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.

Into starter, stir ingredients well and keep at room temperature for
10 to 12 hours.

Makes 2 - 3 cups.
