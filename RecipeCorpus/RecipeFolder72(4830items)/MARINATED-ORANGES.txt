Categories:
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Oranges -- large

1    Orange -- juiced (large)

With a sharp knife, cut off the ends of the oranges. Set each orange
on a cutting board and slice off the peel, making sure to remove all
the white spongy pith. Slice the oranges into thin rounds and remove
all the seeds.

Put the slices into a deep serving platter. Add the lemon and orange

with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about one hour. Serve with some
of the juices poured over. Typos by Brenda Adams
