To make pate, blend cream and blue cheese until smooth. Add Salt,
pepper and sour cream.  Whisk eggs and port wine, blend into cheese
mixture. Spoon mixture into a terrine or 9 by 5 inch loaf pan lined
with parchment paper or buttered foil.  Place in a large pan, pour in
enough hot water to reach half way up on side of baking dish. Bake in
a 325 oven for 1 hour or until a knife inserted into the centre comes
out almost clean. Cool overnight in refrigerator or until very firm.
Gently remove from terrine or pan. Remove foil, slice and serve on a
dessert plate with a little raspberry sauce. To make raspberry sauce,
combine all ingredients, bring to a boil and simmer until slightly
thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove ginger if desired, then puree and
strain. Pour over each pate slice.
