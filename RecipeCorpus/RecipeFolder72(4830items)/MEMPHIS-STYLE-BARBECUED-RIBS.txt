Title: MEMPHIS-STYLE BARBECUED RIBS
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Racks baby back ribs
2 ts Salt
2 ts Coarse ground black pepper
Apple Juice for Basting
1 c  Red wine vinegar
2 c  Onion, chopped
2 ea Garlic, cloves, minced
1/4 c  Mustard, yellow prepared
1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
2 c  Ketchup
2 ea Lemons, thinly sliced
1 ts Louisiana hot sauce
Trim as much fat as possible from ribs.  On bone side, work knife tip
beneath membrane that covers bone until finger tips can be worked
beneath rack membrane, loosening enough to get firm grip. Then peel
membrane off rack.  With paring knife, scrape any fat away from bone.

Sprinkle ribs on both sides with even, light coating of salt and
pepper. Place ribs, bone-side-down on grill. Grill over low fire 1
1/2 hurs, turning every 15 to 20 minutes, replenishing fire as
necessary. Baste with apple juice at every turn during first half of
cooking period either by brushing on, or simply spraying apple juice
from spray bottle. If smoking with indirect heat, turn at 1 hour
intervals, cooking 4 to 6 hours.

Combine vinegar, onion, garlic, mustard, sugar and hot sauce in
blender. Blend until smooth.  Place in saucepan and add ketchup.
Simmer 20 minutes. Add lemon slices. Stir occasionally to keep from
sticking. Use sauce as frequent baste for last half of cooking
period, whether grilling or smoking, being careful not to burn ribs.
Serve remaining sauce on side.
