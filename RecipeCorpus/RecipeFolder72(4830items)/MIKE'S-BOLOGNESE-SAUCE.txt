Thanks to Julian Manders for the start to my redition of this sauce.

In the micro, do the bacon till it is leathery and done, but not
crisp. Distribute bacon on one or two paper towels, roll them up, and
give them a good squeeze so the paper absorbs most of the remaining
bacon fat. Set aside.  Heat the oil in a deep, heavy non-aluminum
kettle (an enameled cast iron casserole or large skillet will do) and
add the vegetables. Cook, stirring, over low heat until the onions
are translucent and the vegetables are softened.  While the veges are
cooking, break up the sausage and fry in a separate pan till just
done.  Drain off the fat. Let the sausage cool a bit, then stick in
the food processor on low to break up the clumps. Now that the bacon
has cooled, pull it apart in small bite sized pieces.

To the veges, add the cooked bacon, broth and wine.  Raise the heat
and cook until the sauce thickens a little. Add the diced tomatoes,
paste, sauce, pepper, oregano, mushrooms, ground sausage, nutmeg, and
stir well.

When the sauce begins to bubble, lower the heat and simmer very
slowly, partly covered, for about 4 hours.  Stir occasionally to
prevent sticking. Before serving, taste for seasoning and adjust.

I serve over rigatoni with freshly grated parmesan. A small green
salad and a couple slices of sour dough spread with garlic butter and
toasted under the broiler in the oven will round out the meal.  Don't
forget the bottle of a dry red wine.  A nice Italian Chianti is in
keeping with the heritage of the meal.
