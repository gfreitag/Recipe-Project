Combine all ingredients except cream and garnishes in a saucepan.
Heat to a boil over medium heat, stirring now and then to prevent
sticking. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Chill.

Cranberry sauce may be stored in refrigerator as long as 1 week. Whip
cream in a cold bowl with cold beaters, to stiff peaks. To make
ahead, put cream into a cheesecloth-lined wire mesh strainer set over
a bowl. Refrigerate, covered. May be prepared as much as 6 hours
ahead of serving. To serve, fold 3/4 cup of the chilled cranberry
sauce, leaving streaks, into the whipped cream. Spoon into a stemmed
serving dish. Garnish with orange rind and mint.
