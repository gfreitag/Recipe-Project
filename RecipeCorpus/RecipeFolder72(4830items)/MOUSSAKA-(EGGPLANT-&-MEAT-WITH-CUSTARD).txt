Peel eggplant and cut into 1/4 inch slices.  Salt both sides heavily,
let sit for 30 minutes.  Pour cold water over eggplant and let sit
for 10 minutes more. Squeeze the water out and blot dry with paper
towels. The natural bitterness will be gone. Coat the pieces with
flour. Heat the begetable oil in a skillet and fry eggplant until
golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

Saute the onion in butter, add the ground meat, and brown well. Add
salt, pepper, nutmeg, parsley, tomato sauce, wine and boiling water.
Cover and cook until the sauce thickens. Beat the eggs and add. Add
cheese and half the grated toast and mix well.

Grease a 12x10x3-inch baking pan.  Spread remaining half of toast
crumbs over bottom.  Arrange half the eggplant over crumbs. Cover
with meat sauce, then sprinkle 2 Tb of cheese from topping over it.
Cover this with the remaining eggplant.

To make the cream sauce, melt butter in a saucepan. Make a paste of
the flour and cold milk and add the flour paste, warm milk and cream
to the pan.  Blend until smooth and simmer about 15 minutes. Remove
from flame and add beaten eggs while stirring the sauce vigorously.
Stir in the salt, nutmeg, and 1/3 cup cheese. Pour over the eggplant
dish. Sprinkle top with remaining chese.  Bake at 375 degrees for 45
minutes. Let the dish stand for 20 minutes before serving.
