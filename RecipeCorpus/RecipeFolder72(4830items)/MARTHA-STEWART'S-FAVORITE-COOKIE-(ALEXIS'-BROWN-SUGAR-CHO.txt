Categories: Chocolate, Cookies
Yield: 50 4-inch coo
2 c  Unsalted butter (4 sticks)
1 c  Granulated sugar
3 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
4 ea Eggs, add one at a time
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
3 1/2 c  All purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Best quality chocolate chips
Alexis Stewart developed this chocolate-chip cookie recipe for her
mother, Martha, when she was twelve years old. Best enjoyed with a
cold glass of milk, these flat buttery cookies combine perfect
amounts of crunch and chewiness. Use an ice-cream scoop to make
evenly sized cookies. If cookies harden before you have a chance to
remove them from the baking sheet, return the sheet to the oven for a
few seconds to soften the dough for easier removal.

1. Heat oven to 375 B0. Cream butter until smooth; add sugars. Beat
in eggs and vanilla. Sift together dry ingredients, and slowly beat
into wet mixture. Fold in chocolate-chips.  Chill dough until firm,
at least
15    minutes.

2. Drop 2 to 3 tablespoons chilled batter per cookie onto a
well-greased baking sheets lined with baking mats or parchment; space
batter about 2 inches apart for spreading.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes,
until golden. Remove from baking sheets, and allow to cool on baking
racks.
