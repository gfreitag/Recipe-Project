Bread
Sandwich fillings
Boiled egg
Piece of ham
For a sandwich fit for a monster, use 3 or more slices of bread
sandwiched together with your favorite fillings. Stack the slices up
and carefully cut diagonally in half. Make a monster face on top of
each half, using slices of boiled egg or cucumbr for eyes, and a
piece of ham, or anything else you can think of cut into a fanged
shape for a mouth.
