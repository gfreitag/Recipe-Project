Andrea's New Orleans Extra Virgin Recipes 1. Slice the skins off the
eggplants, and slice them about 1/4 inch thick from top to bottom.
Then slice across to get pieces the size of French fries. Put the
eggplant strips in a bowl and toss with the 1/2 cup of salt.

2. Move the eggplant strips into a colander, arraying them in a
relatively uniform layer up the sides. Put a bowl the same size as
the colander inside the colander and weigh it down with three or so
pounds of weight. [I find a foil covered common solid brick is a
handy kitchen tool.] Put the entire apparatus in the sink to drain
for 45 minutes. This will remove any bitterness from the eggplant.

3. Rinse the salt off the eggplant with cold water. Drain it well,
then SQUEEZE it dry. Put the eggplant in a bowl with the vinegar, and
marinate it for 30 minutes. [It will return to shape like a wet
sponge.]

4. Drain the vinegar from the eggplant and squeeze it dry again. Put
the eggplant into a bowl with all the other ingredients.

5. Pour the contents into a canning jar. Make SURE there is enough
olive oil to completely cover all the eggplant about 1/2 inch deep.
Tightly seal and refrigerate the jar. Marinate for at least a week;
The ideal time is actually three months, and the eggplant will keep
getting better even after that.
