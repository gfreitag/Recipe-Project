Meatloaf ~ 5th prize

Mix eggs, breadcrumbs, onion, V8 juice, green pepper and seasonings
in a large bowl until well combined. Add meat, 1/4 pound at a time,
and mix until combined. Shape into two round loaves and place two
strips of bacon in an X across each. Place on a rack in a roasting
pan and bake at 350F for 1 hour. (This is a healthy meatloaf.
Calories are reduced by baking loaves on a rack so the fat runs off!)
