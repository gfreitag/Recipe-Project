This is a worksheet for my Daikon Kim Chee....
:
Seenote: Salted Shrimp, "Assi" brand salted jarred shrimp. highly
recommended.
Day One: 1. Peel the daikon and cut into 3/4" cubes. Cut the onions
into 1 " strips and then shred lengthwise into slivers. Mix the
daikon and onion strips in a bowl, add the 1/2 cup of salt and mix
very well and let sit overnight.
2. Peel and mince garlic and gingeroot.  Cut celery,carrot, and
scallions, slice chives . Mix these ingredients together with the
pepper and granulated sugar and combine into the daikon and onion
mixture. Add shrimp, and chives The next day: 3. Slosh the liquid
around the cubes of daikon to wash off the salt. Lift the cubes of
daikon out of the brine and let them drip off in a strainer or a
colander. In a large bowl mix the daikon and onion with the garlic
gingeroot mixture, mix very well.
4. Pack the daikon and onion mixture into the bottom of a crock or
other non-metal container. Press down. Set a small weight on top of
the cover and let sit overnight. It can be stored for a week or
longer prior to opening. Keep it in a cool (60 degree) place. Daikon
Kimchee will be ready to eat in 2 days....
Mikenote: The question of whether to cover it tightly or to let the
kim chee breathe is still up to you.... The original crocks that
either were or were not buried in the ground, have a water seal
around the top that lets the air out but nothing back in..... I have
made good Kim Chee (to me), both ways... End Mikenote: 5. After
removing the Kim Chi from the crock it can be stored in glass jars
and used as needed. This is a medium hot recipe, if it is still not
hot enough, diced red peppers with seeds can be added, to the daikon
and onion mixture. Enjoy. Dramatically changed and updated by Mike
