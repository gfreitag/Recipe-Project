Title: MEAT BALL STEW
Categories: Stews
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Minced pork
1 tb Fat
1 ea Onion
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
3 pt Water
1/2 c  Browned flour
Mix the seasonings with the meat in a large bowl, add the onion,
browned in the fat. Work the mixture with the hands to make sure the
seasonings are well distributed .Look over your stock of spices and
use your imagination.remember that no one spice should predominate.
Shape the meat into 1 1/2 inch balls and flour them lightly. Drop
them into 3 pints of boiling water and cook slowly for 1 1/2 hours.
At the end of this time thicken the stock with 1/2 cup of browned
flour. Browned flour may be added directly to stock without being
mixed to a paste if the stock is boiling there will be no lumps. The
stock will jell when cool and your ragout de boulettes will keep for
some time.
