Title: MARINADE FOR CHARCOALED ROAST
Categories: Sauces, Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Inch thick sirloin tip
Roast
1/2 c  Oil
1/2 c  Red table wine
Juice of one lemon
1/4 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Rosemary
1 ts MSG
3 tb Green onion flakes
1 ts Salt
Lots of black pepper
1    Clove garlic -- pressed
1    Bay leaves
2 tb Meat tenderizer
Place in jar and shake well..  Take large fork and poke holes in
roast. Place roast and marinade in large Ziploc bag, or in flat pan
and squeeze or turn to thoroughly coat meat. Let marinate 2 days in
refrigerator.

I made a  medium fire in the bottom of the smoker and left out the
water pan and placed the roast on the grill for about 20 minutes per
side. It is supposed to be medium, not well done. You'll have to
check for doneness then and if not done to your taste, cook longer.
It is FANTASTIC!! Dark brown on the outside and very tender on the
inside.

I also used the same marinade, doubled, and marinated a whole sirloin
tip in a huge stainless steel bowl and smoked it with the water pan
and it was great too, but only for a crowd!
