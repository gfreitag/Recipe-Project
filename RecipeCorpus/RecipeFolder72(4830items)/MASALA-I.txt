Masala is a blend of spices and herbs used primarily in Indian,
caribbean, malaysian cooking.  In the US, we can get curry powder,
which is just another form of masala (I've learned this in the 3
years I've been here in South Africa).  You can mix your own or
purchase from a spice shop that carries Indian or Malay spices.  I
rarely use prepackaged curry powder, but it will work in the recipe.
I've included a couple of Masala recipes here. (If you can find
someone selling DURBAN SPICES, you've found the best Masala mixtures.)
