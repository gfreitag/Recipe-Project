Title: OCTOPUS TIDBITS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Octopus meat
2    Eggs
2 ts Dill weed
2 tb Finely chopped onion
1/2 c  Breadcrumbs
1/4 c  Melted butter
-OR- margarine
Boil fresh octopus for at least 10 minutes. Remove skin. The skin and
suckers will "slip" off the tentacles when it is cooked. Prepare
cooked octopus for tidbits by grinding as you would hamburger. Once
is sufficient. No further tenderizing is necessary. Mix ingre- dients
together. Form into balls no larger than 1" in diameter. Roll in
bread crumbs to coat. Pan fry in butter or margarine until golden
brown. Garnish with lemon, lime, tomatoes or lettuce.

These delicious tidbits are wonderful for fancy buffets, freeze well,
and make a hit at any and every party. Great for the gourmet, and
good for home. It is difficult to say how many this serves, as some
people love it and gobble them all up, and others only eat a few if
they know what they are eating. For a main meal, it should serve four.
