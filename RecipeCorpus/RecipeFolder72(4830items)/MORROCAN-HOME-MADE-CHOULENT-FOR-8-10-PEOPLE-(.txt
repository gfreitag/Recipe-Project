Yield: 10 Servings  2
2    cups of big white beans 1.5 cups of kidney beans (dark

1    tablespoon honey
2    big diced onions
2    whole onions w/ skin
diced parsley
4    tablespoons of cooking oil 1 cheese cloth (gauze or even
handkerchief)
1    big (very big) pot Directions: Soak all beans for at least
12 hours before cooking. Start cooking at 6:30 in the afternoon for
Choulent ready next day at 12:30 or so.

Sautee 1 diced onion till brown in oil. Add meat till brown, turn
over a few times in pot. Take meat out and then reduce fire. Add
layers (between every layer sprinkle with spices) of white beans,
hommous beans, kidney beans, potatoes, meat. Strain rice. Mix rice
with chopped parsley, paprika, salt, pepper and other diced onion.
Place in cheese cloth and tighten it (take in mind that rice expands
during cooking and so leave a little space in cloth). Place the rice
in middle of pot. Cover with another layer of beans. Add the rest of
the potatoes. Cover with water to about 4 cm from edge of pot. Bring
to a boil. Let simmer for about an hour on medium fire. Add eggs at
room temparature (whole eggs w/ shell). Add honey, onions with skin.
Reduce to minimum fire. Cover tightly with lid.

After 4 hours taste liquid and add spices if needed (add 1/2 a cup of
water so spices reach bottom of pot). During cooking you may add
water if needed (stew must be moist but not watery). Keep tightly
covered at all times. If about 2 hours before serving time the stew
seems too watery than uncover lid and increase fire so water can
evaporate.

Serving: Take eggs out and wash under cold water. Peal and cut in
half. Take out rice bag and open with scissors.

Enjoy (Watch out for the day after....)
