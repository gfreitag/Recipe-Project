In a large pan, saute the chorizo over moderate heat til it loses its
pink colour, about 3 min.  Remove with slotted spoon. Saute onion and
garlic in chorizo fat over moderate heat for 10 min. Add sherry, and
cook 4-5 min, til the liquid evaporates.  Add to the chorizo and set
aside. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. When hot but not
smoking, brown the pork cubes on all sides.  Return the pork and
chorizo mixture to the pot, add the spices, oregano and beef stock.
Bring to a boil over high heat, scraping the bottom of the pot to
remove any particles. Reduce heat to moderate, and cook 2 hours or
til meat is tender. Add the hominy and lime juice and cook 10
minutes. Mix in the green onions and cilantro just before serving.
Serve hot. We usually eat it on top of rice.
