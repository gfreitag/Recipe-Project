Title: NOODLES IN CREAM WITH BRESAOLA
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Tagliatelle
4 oz Button Mushrooms
4 oz Bresaola ( Air Dried Beef)
5 fl Double Cream
2 oz Grated Parmesan
1 ts Salt
1 ts Olive oil
Into a large saucepan of boiling water, put the salt and olive oil,
then the pasta. To cook it the crafty way, let the pasta boil for
exactly 3 minutes. Take it off the heat, put on the lid and let it
stand for exactly seven minutes to cook it perfectly al dente.
Meanwhile, trim mushrooms and clean by putting them into a colander
and pouring boiling water over them. Pat dry and slice them with the
bresaola into quarter-inch slices. In a saucepan, heat cream and stir
in the mushroom and bresaola. When the pasta is ready drain it well,
heap in a serving dish and pour the sauce over it. Toss it quickly
and serve with freshly grated parmesan and crisp salad
