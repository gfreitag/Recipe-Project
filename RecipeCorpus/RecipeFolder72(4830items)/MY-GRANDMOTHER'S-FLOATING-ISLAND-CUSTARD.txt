(My Grandmother was born in 1873 - this was HER mother's recipe!)
DIRECTIONS (As I recall watching her make it):

Cook milk, eggs, sugar and cornstarch until thickened. Remove from
heat, add vanilla. Cool and refrigerate.

NOTE: This custard is the consistency of gravy. Grandmother always
kept this in a quart jar and it was always served with her homemade
Angel Food Cakes.
