Title: MARTI'S WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 5 Servings
12 c  Whole wheat flour(up to 14
-cups)
2 tb Dry yeast;heaping
1/2 c  High gluten flour
500    MG Vitamin C
5 c  Warm water (120-130*)
1 c  Plain yogurt
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Honey
1 1\2 tb Salt

In mixer bowl equipped with kneading arm put ingredients in in this
order: water, yeast, honey, oil, yogurt, 9 cups ww flour, high gluten
flour, vitamin C and salt. Pulse a few times to mix. Turn mixer on,
and quickly add remaining flour, one cup at a time, until dough forms
a ball and cleans the side of the bowl. The amount of flour may vary.
Knead 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 200 during this time. Lightly oil
hands. Divide dough into equal portions. Shape into loaves and place
in greased (I also flour) bread pans. Turn off oven. Place bread in
oven, arranging pans with space between to allow heat to circulate
freely. Set a kitchen timer and watch closely. Let rise until almost
double in bulk, approx. 15-30 minutes. Leave bread in oven and turn
heat to 350, baking 30-35 minutes. Immediately remove from pans; let
cook on wire racks. This is adapted from Set For Life. This is how I
make it and the bread is moist, scrumptous.
