Title: MOVIE GLASS
Categories: Kids, Candies, Misc
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Water
1 3/4 c  White sugar
1 tb Light corn syrup
Recipe by: Beakman's World WHAT YOU NEED: 1/2 cup water - 1-3/4 cups
white (granulated) sugar - 1 Tbs light corn syrup - help and
permission from a grown-up.

WHAT TO DO:  Ask a grown-up helper to boil the water and stir in the
sugar and syrup.  Let it reach a hard boil. Boil six minutes. This
will be extremely hot - over 300 degrees - and very dangerous.
Carefully pour it onto a clean plate.  Let cool for an hour and it
will pop out of the plate.
This is break-away glass, like they use to smash over people's heads
in the movies.  It is also hard candy.
