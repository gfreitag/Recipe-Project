This combination makes a fragrant, satisfying end product. If you
forget the overnight soak you can still make the recipe (see note).

Directions:

Soak the millet in 2 c water overnight.  Without draining, bring the
millet, water, and salt to a boil. Reduce the heat and let the pudding
simmer about 25 min until tender.

Remove the pot from heat and add the fruit, spices, oil and extract.
Beat hard for a few strokes.  Gently stir in the diced fruit. Divide
into two bowls and top them with chopped almonds.

Note: If you want to make this pudding but forgot to soak the millet
overnight, simmer it 35 min over very low heat. Remove from the stove,
fluff with a fork and cover for 10 more min. Millet or any grain,
however, is more digestible when soaked or slow-cooked for hours.
