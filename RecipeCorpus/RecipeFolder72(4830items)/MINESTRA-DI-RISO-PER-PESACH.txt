"I did not learn of the traditional matza ball soup served during the
first two nights of Passover until I came to this country. Our
classic soup was a chicken soup with rice to which were added balls
of chicken breast and whole immature eggs (which are still at the
stage where the outer shell and white have not yet formed; they are
perfectly round and vary from less than 1" to less than 1 mm in
diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with the white rice,
the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens raised on
private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature
eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.

Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten
egg with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add
ground chicken, salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in
the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny
balls, no larger than the egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add
rice, chicken balls and cook, covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs,
discard whites and place one hard boiled egg yolk in each of the
eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg yolks and serve immediately.
