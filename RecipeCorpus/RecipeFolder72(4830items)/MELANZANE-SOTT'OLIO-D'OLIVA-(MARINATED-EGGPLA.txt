Title: MELANZANE SOTT'OLIO D'OLIVA (MARINATED EGGPLA
Categories: Italian, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
4 md Eggplants (about 3 1/2 lbs)
1/2 c  Salt
1 qt White vinegar
1 c  Extra virgin olive oil
3 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Chopped garlic
1 ts Crushed red pepper
1 tb Dried oregano OR
2 1/2    Fresh oregano
1/2 ts Salt
1. Slice the skins off the eggplants, and slice them about 1/4 inch
thick from top to bottom. Then slice across to get pieces the size of
French fries. Put the eggplant strips in a bowl and toss with the 1/2
cup of salt. 2. Move the eggplant strips into a colander, arraying
them in a relatively uniform layer up the sides. Put a bowl the same
size as the colander inside the colander and weigh it down with three
or so pounds of weight. [I find a foil covered common solid brick is
a handy kitchen tool] Put the entire apparatus in the sink to drain
for 45 minutes. This will remove any bitterness from the eggplant. 3.
Rinse the salt off the eggplant with cold water. Drain it well, then
SQUEEZE it dry. Put the eggplant in a bowl with the vinegar, and
marinate it for 30 minutes. [It will return to shape like a wet
sponge] 4. Drain the vinegar from the eggplant and squeeze it dry
again. Put the eggplant into a bowl with all the other ingredients.
5. Pour the contents into a canning jar. Make SURE therre is enough
olive oil to completely cover all the eggplant about 1/2 inch deep.
Tightly seal and refrigerate the jar. Marinate for at least a week;
the ideal time is actually three months, and the eggplant will keep
getting better even after that.
