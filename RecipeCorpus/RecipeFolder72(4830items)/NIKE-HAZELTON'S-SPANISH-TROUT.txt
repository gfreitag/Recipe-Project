Title: NIKE HAZELTON'S SPANISH TROUT
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Whole trout, cleaned
1/2    Lemon
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Soft fresh bread crumbs
1 cl Garlic, minced
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
1/3 c  Sherry
Preheat oven to moderate (350).
Rub the trout with the lemon, then squeeze the lemon and reserve the
juice. Season the fish with salt and pepper.
Heat the oil.  Remove it from the heat and stir in the bread crumbs,
garlic, and parsley.  Sprinkle half of the mixture over the bottom of
a greased shallow baking dish. Place the trout on top. Sprinkle the
fish with the remaining bread-crumb mixture.  Sprinkle with the
reserved lemon juice.
Bake the fish for 10 minutes, then add the sherry. Continue to bake
for 10 to 15 minutes, basting occasionally with the sherry. When the
fish is done, it should flake easily when tested with a fork. The New
