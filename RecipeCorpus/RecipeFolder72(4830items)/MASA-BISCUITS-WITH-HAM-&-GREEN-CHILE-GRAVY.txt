Title: MASA BISCUITS WITH HAM & GREEN CHILE GRAVY
Categories: Ham, Sauces, Mexican
Yield: 8 Servings
5    Long green chiles (Anaheims)
6 tb Unsalted butter
1 lb Firm, smoky ham, trimmed,
-cut into 1/4" cubes
1/4 c  Unbleached A-P flour
5 c  Milk, 2% ok
1/2 ts Salt
8    Freshly baked Masa Biscuits,
-(recipe), split
In the open flame of a gas burner or under a pre-heated broiler,
roast the long green chiles, turning them, until they are lightly but
evenly charred. Steam the chiles in a paper bag, or in a bowl,
covered with a plate, until cool.  Rub away the burned peel. Stem and
seed the chiles and coarsely chop them.  There should be about 3/4
cup.

In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the ham
cubes and cook them, stirring constantly, until lightly browned,
about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the ham cubes and cook,
stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.  Slowly whisk the milk into the
ham mixture. Stir in the green chiles and salt. Raise the heat to
medium and bring the milk mixture to a simmer. Cook, stirring
occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pan, until thickened into
a medium gravy, about 7 minutes. Adjust the seasoning.

Arrange the biscuits, split-sides up, on 8 plates. Spoon the gravy
over and around the, using it all. Serve immediately.

NOTE:  I tend to add a bit more "heat" by adding some fresh jalepeno,
cut into very fine julienne as garnish to each person's serving.
Looks pretty, too.  This is also a good dish to make using smoked
turkey (thigh) instead of ham.
