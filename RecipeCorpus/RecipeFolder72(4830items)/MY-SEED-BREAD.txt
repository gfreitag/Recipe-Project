1 c  Bread flour
1/2 c  Pecans
1 c  Wheat flour
1/4 c  Poppy seeds
1/4 c  Rye flour
1 1/2 tb Caraway seeds
1/4 c  Cornmeal

1 tb Puritan oil
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Honey
1/4 c  Raisins

(Put ingredients into b/m according to your machine's instructions. I
have the Panasonic; so the yeast goes into the yeast dispenser.) This
made a beautiful dense loaf, with a sweet nutty flavor. We all loved
it! Hope you all do, too! Bettie, DFW, TX FROM: BETTIE COOPER
