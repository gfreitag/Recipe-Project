Title: MARTY FEINS' EGG DROP SOUP
Categories: China, Soups/stews
Yield: 1 Servings   A simple and good egg drop soup is simply some very rich chicken
soup..

Some cornstarch to slightly thicken, like maybe a tsp, dissolved in a
little stock, added to for each bowl of soup, bring to a simmer, add
the cornstarch mixture when soup simmers. Add a little soy, very
little to taste. While soup is on low boil, beat an egg or two,
slowly dibble into the soup and stir quickly. Season to taste.

To make 'Egg Flower' soup, do the same, but when adding the eggs,
pour heavier down a fork right into the 'boiling' soup. Don't stir
until egg coagulates.
The egg will 'flower' up and look nice...
