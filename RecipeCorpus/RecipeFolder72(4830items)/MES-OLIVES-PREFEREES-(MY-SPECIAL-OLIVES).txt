Yield: 1 Servings
:
2    shallots -- whole or sliced
4    cloves garlic, to 5 cloves
barely crushed
thyme, rosemary, fennel seed
chives, sage -- fresh or
dried

1/2    lemon -- juiced
Worcestershire sauce
Tabasco or hot pepper
flakes

:
1 c  olive oil

Place the olives in a jar with a tight-fitting lid.

Add to the jar shallots, garlic, a handful of fresh or dried herbs,
chopped or left whole, lemon juice, a few shakes of Worcestershire
sauce and a few drops of Tabasco or shakes of hot pepper flakes.

Pour olive oil to cover the olives and herbs and seal the lid. Shake a
couple of times to mix all ingredients well. Leave these olives to
plump in the oil and absorb the perfume of the herbs. As you use them
replenish the stock with more olives in the same oil mixture until it
at last seems too tired to do the job. The herb-scented oil is then
perfect for brushing on grilled foods as they finish or in other
cooking.
