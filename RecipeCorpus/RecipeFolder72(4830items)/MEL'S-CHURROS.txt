1 c  White flour
3    Eggs
1/2 ts Cinnamon
3/4    Stick butter
1 c  Water
1 pn Salt
1 c  Powdered Sugar
Corn oil
Bring water to a boil. Add butter and salt.  Add flour & remove from
heat. Beat with a fork until well-mixed. Beat in the eggs and
cinnamon. Put the mixture into a pastry bag. Heat about an inch of
oil in a pan, or use a deep fryer, to about 350F.  Squeeze the
mixture into the oil, making the churros about 7" long.  Cook 3-5 at
a time, depending on how large your skillet or pan is until they are
a nice golden color, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels.
Transfer to another dish, sprinkle sifted powdered sugar over them,
and serve immediately. Makes about 18
