Title: NORWEGIAN NOG CHRISTMAS BREAD
Categories: Breads, Machine, Holidays
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Low-fat or regular eggnog,
Heated to 105 to 115 degrees
2 c  Bread flour (to 2 1/4c)
1 ts Ground cardamom
1/4 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
1 lg Egg yolk
4 tb Unsalted butter, softened
1/3 c  Dried currants or raisins
1/3 c  Chopped candied fruit & rind
Confectioners' sugar glaze
1. Combine yeast and eggnog in the bucket of a bread machine,
stirring to dissolve yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Add 1 cup flour. Begin dough cycle, letting it run just long enough
to mix dough. Stop cycle and  leave mixture in bucket, covered, until
it is light and puffy, about 1 hour.

2. Add 1 cup of the remaining flour, the cardamom, salt, egg, egg
yolk and butter. Begin dough cycle. After dough is mixed and as it is
still kneading, check the texture of the dough and add additional
flour as needed, to make a  soft, slightly sticky dough. Add currants
and fruit as indicated in instruction manual. Complete dough cycle.
When bread is cool, glaze if  desired.

Note: If you prefer a traditional shape, the dough can be removed
from the bread machine after the rising cycle. Shape dough into an
oval, place it on a greased baking sheet, cover and let rise at room
temperature for about 40 minutes. Brush the loaf with a glaze made
from an egg yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon whipping cream; sprinkle
with coarse sugar. Bake in a heated 325 degree oven until golden, 30
to 35 minutes.
