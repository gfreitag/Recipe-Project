Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Scalded milk
2 tb Margarine
2 ts Salt
1 c  Molasses
-or 1/2 molasses-1/2 honey
1 c  Cold water
1/4 c  :warm water (105F-to-115F)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Uncooked oatmeal
6 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
MIX THE MILK, MARGARINE, salt and molasses, stir in the cold water
and cool to lukewarm. Pour the warm water into a warm, very large
bowl, sprinkle in the yeast and stir to dissolve. Add the cooled
mixture, oatmeal and 4 cups of the flour and mix well. Mix in the
remaining flour and knead on a lightly floured board until elastic, 5
to 8 minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a greased bowl, turning to
grease all over. Cover with cloth and let rise in a warm, draft-free
place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down
and knead lightly 1 to 2 minutes. Divide the dough in half, shape
into 2 loaves, and place in greased 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pans. Cover
and let rise until almost doubled in bulk. Toward the end of rising,
preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the loaves 40 minutes until browned
and hollow-sounding when tapped. Turn out and cool upright on a wire
rack before cutting. Makes 2 Loaves
