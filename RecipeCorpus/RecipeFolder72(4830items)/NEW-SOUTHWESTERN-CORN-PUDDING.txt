4    ears corn
Yield: 4 Servings

1 1/2 c  cottage cheese -- cream in
processor
:
1/2 c  grated Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 c  grated Cheddar cheese -- or

1 TB chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper
:

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish.
Cook the corn in the husk for 2 minutes on high in a microwave oven.
Cool a minute or two, then remove the husk. Alternately, place the
shucked corn in a large quantity of boiling water until done, about 5
minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut the corn off the cob, then scrape
down the cob with the back of the knife to get the "milk" out.
Combine the corn, milk, cottage cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, Cheddar
cheese, eggs, onion, chile peppers, cornmeal mix, and cilantro.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. The pudding can be refrigerated
for 4 hours at this point.

Pour the mixture into the prepared souffle dish. Place a damp kitchen
towel in a baking pan. Place the souffle dish on the towel and add
enough hot water to the pan to reach two-thirds of the way up the
sides of the dish. Bake for 1 hour or until the pudding is lightly
browned and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
Serve hot.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings
