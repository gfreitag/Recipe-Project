=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 425 F. Butter the bottom
and sides of a 9 inch pie plate. Place a 12 inch square sheet of
waxed paper in the plate and butter the waxed paper. In a medium
sized saucepan, combine the chocolate chips, 1/2 cup butter, the
sugar, water, and coffee granules; heat over medium heat for 2 to 3
minutes, until the chocolate and butter are melted, stirring
constantly. Remove from the heat and stir in the eggs, until the
mixture is smooth. Pour into the waxed paper-lined pie plate. Bake
for 10 minutes; the cake will not be completely set in the middle.
Cool, cover loosely, then shill for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. When
ready to serve, remove the cake from the refrigerator and allow to
sit for 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto a large flat serving dish
and remove the waxed paper. Top with whipped cream.
