Title: NORWEGIAN SALMON SPREAD
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 2 Cups  1 8 oz. package cream cheese (room temperature) 1/4 to 1/3 pounds of
Lox - Chop the Lox into about 1/4" squares. (I use Lox trimmings,
you're going to chop them and they're Â½ the price of sliced Lox.) 1
1/2 to 2 green onions with some green left on. Finely chop the green
onions. 1/4 tsp. (more or less) course ground garlic powder (I use
Lawry's) white pepper to taste (optional)

Put all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Refrigerate, in plastic
wrap, until used. It's better to make it a day or two in advance. It
can be pressed into a mold that has been lined with plastic wrap and
turned out at time of serving.
