1 c  Potatoes, diced & peeled
1 c  Green peas, frozen or fresh
1 c  Green beans, 1/4 inch pieces
1 c  Finely shredded carrots
1/2 c  Finely shredded beets
1/4 c  Finely chopped celery
2 ea Hot green chilies, quartered
2/3 c  Cooked chick peas
3 tb Almonds
3 tb Walnuts
3 tb Sunflower seeds
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Turmeric
1 ts Garam masala
3/4 c  Soy milk
2 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Whole wheat flour
2/3 c  White poppy seeds
Ghee for shallow frying
Place the cauliflower, potatoes, fresh peas & green beans in the
bottom of a pot & cover with water.  Put the carrots, beets & celery
in a steaming basket, cover & place over the pot. Cook until the
vegetables are tender-crisp.  Drian, saving the water.  Add the
frozen peas, defrosted first, to the steamed vegetables.

In a blender, while it is running, drop in the chilies. Add the chick
peas, nuts & seeds & process until the peas are mashed. Some
vegetable water may facilitate this.  Add the cauliflower, potatoes,
fresh peas, if using, & beans.  Pulse on & off till they are coarsely
mashed. Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the steamed vegetables, salt,
pepper, turmeric & garam masala. Mix well.  Divide into portions.

Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.  Flatten a portion into an
almond shaped cutlet, 1/2 inch thick & place on the sheet. Cover &
refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Whisk the soy milk, cornstarch & flour in a flat bowl until smooth.
Dip each cutlet into the batter, roll in poppy seeds & set aside
briefly to air dry.

Heat ghee to a depth of 3/4 inch.  Without crowding, fry the cutlets
in batches for 2 minutes each side. Drain & serve.
