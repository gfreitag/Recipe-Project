Title: MR. FOOD'S LICKETY-SPLIT PASTA
Categories: Seafood, Scallops, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Uncooked spaghetti
28 oz Crushed tomatoes
1 lb Bay scallops, quartered
1 tb Dried parsley flakes
1 ts Dried basil
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
======================================================= ======
Prepare the spaghetti according to the package directions. Drain,
rinse, drain again, and set aside in a large bowl; keep warm.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat the tomatoes (and their juice)
over medium heat until bubbling. Reduce the heat to medium- NOTE:
Linguine, angel hair, or your favorite kind of pasta works just as
well as spaghetti! And if you'd rather use canned clams, cut-up
shrimp, or imitation crabmeat, those will all work as well as the
scallops.
