Categories: Entrees, Mom
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Sausage
2    Butternut squash, halved
1 lg Egg
2 tb Milk (or less)
Onion, chopped (optional)
1/4 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Tarragon

Fry sausage; scramble till thoroughly done and drain.

Bake squash in pan at 350 degrees face down in a pan with water barely
covering the bottom, for about 1 hour. (When you poke it, dimple will
remain.)  Cool squash.

Return sausage to skillet.  Scoop squash into skillet, leaving about
1/4 inch in shell to hold shape.  Stir squash and spices with sausage.

In small bowl, beat egg and milk; blend into cold mixture. Spoon back
into skins and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until set, with
no water in the pan.  Just before serving, dot tops with butter.
