Categories: Salads, Relishes
Yield: 9 Servings
1 pk Unflavored gelatin
2 tb Sugar
1/4 ts -Salt
1 cn 11 oz. Mandarin oranges
2 tb Lemon juice
1 cn Whole cranberry sauce; 16 oz
1/2 c  Finely diced celery
1/4 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
1. In saucepan, mix together gelatine, sugar and salt. Drain mandarin
oranges; stir syrup into gelatine mixture. Place over low heat; stir
constantly until gelatine and sugar are dissolved, then remove from
heat. (I do this in the microwave.) 2. Add lemon juice, whole
cranberry sauce, diced celery, and chopped nuts.
3. Arrange oranges in mold; spoon in cranberry sauce. (A ring mold,
small Tupperware mold, or pretty crystal bowl, can be used.)
Refrigerate. Serve.
I have used this recipe since 1962, when it was given to me by a
fellow employee at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. My
mother (80 years old in 1992) requests this every Thanksgiving. The
combined flavors are very tasty.
