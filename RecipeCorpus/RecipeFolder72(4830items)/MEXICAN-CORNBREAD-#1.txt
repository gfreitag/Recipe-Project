Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Chop the onion and the
jalapenos finely.  Crumble the bacon. Mix together the cornmeal,
flour, soda, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. In a separate bowl,
whisk together the buttermilk, beaten eggs, and oil.  Add to the dry
ingredients with a few swift strokes of the mixing spoon. Don't beat
the dough---just stir enough to moisten all particles.  Fold in the
onion, garlic powder, jalapenos, pimiento, bacon, corn, and cheese
quickly. Bake in a cast iron skillet in a 400 degree oven for 25 to
30 minutes, until the top is browned and a toothpick tests clean.
