Title: MILK PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 1 Servings
2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Milk
5 tb Unsalted butter; softened
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
Recipe by: Pizza In a large bowl combine 2 3/4 cups flour, milk,
butter, baking powder and salt.  Stir with a fork until a soft dough
forms. Shape into a ball.  Lightly flour a work surface with about
1/2 cup flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a round
1/8 inch thick and 12 inches in diameter.  Flip it over occasionally
as you roll it out. The dough should be slightly thinner in the
middle than at the edge. When it is the correct size, lift the edge
of the pizza to form a slight rim.
