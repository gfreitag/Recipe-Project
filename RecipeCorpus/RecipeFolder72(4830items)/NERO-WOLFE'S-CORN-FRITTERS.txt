Remove the husks from the corn and score each row of ears, letting
the corn milk drain into a bowl. Then cut the kernels off into the
bowl. Add the salt, milk, and sifted flour, and blend well. Let the
mixture stand in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Beat the egg whites

turning once. Serve immediately with blackberry jam, honey or anchovy
butter.
