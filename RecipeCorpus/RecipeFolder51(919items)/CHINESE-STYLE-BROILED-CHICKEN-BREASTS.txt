Title: CHINESE-STYLE BROILED CHICKEN BREASTS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Ethnic, Kooknet, Cyberealm
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Chicken Breasts, boned with
Wings attached
Salt and pepper
2 tb Soy Sauce
2 tb Maple Syrup
1 tb Sesame or Olive Oil
1 ts Red Wine Vinegar
1 ts Garlic, finely minced
1/4 ts Red Pepper Flakes
Sprinkle the breasts with salt an pepper. Combine the soy sauce, maple
syrup, oil, vinegar, garlic and pepper flakes in a dish large enough
to hold the breasts in 1 layer. Blend well.

Add the chicken breast halves and coat them with the marinade.
Arrange them skin side up in the dish and cover them with plastic
wrap. Let stand 15 minutes, or until ready to cook.

Meanwhile, preheat broiler or a charcoal grill. Arrange the breasts
skin side down in 1 layer in a baking dish. Place the chicken under
the broiler about 6: from the heat. Leave the door partly open. Cook
about 5 minutes and turn the pieces. Cook skin side up for about 2
minutes. Shift the pan to the lower rack so that the pieces are about
12" from the heat. Continue broiling skin side up with the broiler
door partly open about 5 minutes longer.

Turn the pieces skin side down and broil 5 minutes longer on the
bottom rack. Turn the pieces skin side up and pour the remaining
marinade over all. Place the chicken about 6" from the heat and broil
about 2 minutes. (If you barbecue, cook the chicken on the hot grill,
covered. The cooking time is the same.)
