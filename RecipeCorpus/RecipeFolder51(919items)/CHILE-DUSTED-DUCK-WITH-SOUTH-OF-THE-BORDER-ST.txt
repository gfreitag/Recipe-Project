Roast duck with stuffing is as easy to prepare as a turkey or a
chicken, though it is doubtful that the Conquistadors at the first
Thanksgiving took the time to stuff the ducks before roasting. In
these days of lean and no fat meals, many people refuse to consider
duck becuase it is perceived as being extremely fatty. Several simple
steps, however, can greatly reduce the fat content. First, if the
skin is pricked before cooking, much of the fat will drain off.
Secondly, removing the skin before serving will lower the fat content
even further.

(1) 4-1/2 to 5 pound duck, remove giblets and neck from inside wash
and pat dry ground red chile powder

Sprinkle the inside cavity of the duck with salt.

Saute the chiles and onion in the margarine until soft.

Combine the mixture with the apples, bread cubes, nuts, and cilantro,
and toss gently to mix. Fill the neck and body cavities loosely with
stuffing. Skewer the neck shut and cover the opening of the body
cavity with aluminum foil and tie the legs together. To be safe, do
not stuff until you are ready to cook.

Place the duck on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. With sharp fork,
prick the skin at 1-inch intervals, being careful not to prick the
meat or it will dry out. This is to allow the duck to continuously
self-baste so you can put it in the oven and forget it.

Dust the duck with the chile powder.  Bake in slow oven, 325 degrees
F., about 3 hours or to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.
