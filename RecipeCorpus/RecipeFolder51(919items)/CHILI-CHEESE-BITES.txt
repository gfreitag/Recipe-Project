Title: CHILI CHEESE BITES
Categories: Snacks, Appetizers
Yield: 32 Servings
4 tb Butter
5 ea Eggs
1/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ds Salt
4 oz Chilies, green, chopped
1 c  Cottage cheese, small curd
8 oz Monterey Jack, shredded
Preheat oven to 400.  Melt butter in 9" square pan in oven. Tip pan
to coat bottom with melted butter.  In large bowl, beat eggs. Stir in
flour, baking powder, and salt. Add melted butter; set pan aside.
Stir in chilies, cottage cheese, and cheese. Blend well. Turn batter
into pan. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake 30-35
minutes longer or until lightly browned. Cool slightly and cut into
small squares.

May be frozen.  If you freeze, flash freeze.  Flash freeze means to
freeze food uncovered until solid, then wrap well and return to
freezer. Use within 2-3 months. How to thaw: Place on baking sheet.
Thaw 1-2 hours at room temperature.  Before serving, reheat in
400-degree oven 10 minutes or until hot.

Note: The recipe may be doubled and baked in a 13"x9" baking dish.

Sylvia's notes: As usual, I didn't have the right size pan, so baked
it in two pie pans for 15 minutes at 400 and then 15 minutes at 350.
They were just a hair too well browned. Quite tasty and would work
well as a potluck where they could be kept warm or nuked.
