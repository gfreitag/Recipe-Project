4 lb Boneless pork roast
4 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 tb Soy sauce
1 1/2 tb Honey
1 c  Chicken broth
3 tb Vinegar
1/4 c  Water
Combine sugar, salt, honey, soy sauce and broth, pour over roast and
let marinate for at least one hour, turning occasionally. Place roast
in shallow pan, pour sauce over and bake at 350 degress for 2 1/2 to
3 hours (170 on meat thermometer).  Baste as often as you can with a
mixture of the vinegar and water to prevent sugar from sorching, and
to add a slight sweet-sour flavor.
