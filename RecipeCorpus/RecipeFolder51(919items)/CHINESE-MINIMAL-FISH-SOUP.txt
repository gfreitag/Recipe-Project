Call your seafood shop ahead of time and ask for the fish to be sliced
paper-thin.  If you have a problem finding someone to do this, the
fish may be sliced by hand. Partially freeze the fish so it is firm,
yet not frozen solid, and slice with a very sharp knife.

Bring water to boil in saucepan.  Add ginger and star anise and
simmer 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let steep about 7 to 10
minutes, no longer, then strain.

Put sliced bok choy in bottom of large serving bowl. Add sliced green
onions and iceberg lettuce.  Arrange fish slices in single layer to
cover.

Return broth to boiling.  Season to taste with salt. Present bowl
without broth at table, then pour boiling seasoned water over fish.
Ladle soup into serving bowls. Top each bowl with 1 cilantro sprig.
