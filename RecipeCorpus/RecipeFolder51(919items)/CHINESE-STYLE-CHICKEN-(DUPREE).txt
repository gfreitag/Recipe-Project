sauce and mix until just combined. Rub paste over chicken and place

golden and a meat thermometer inserted in thigh registers 180
degrees, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and
cook according to package directions, just until al dente. Drain and
place in a warmed large serving bowl. Transfer roasted chicken to a
cutting board or platter. Skim some fat from pan juices, then scrape
the pan with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits from bottom
