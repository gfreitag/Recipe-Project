Chop or shread the cooked lobster meat and refrigerate until dressing
has been prepared. For the dressing, place the yolk in a mixing bowl
and add vinegar, mustard, tomato paste, salt and pepper and cayenne.
Gradually add the oil, beating vigorously with a wire whisk. Juice
the lemon. Beat in the lemon juice, tarragon and cognac. Add lobster
and tomatoes to the dressing and fold in with a rubber spatula. This
may be done in advance and refrigerated for an hour or so. Prepare
the salad: When ready to serve, stack crisped romaine lettuce leaves
and slice them into fine shreads. Place shreads on individual salad
plates. Top with lobster dressing and serve immediately. (You may
substitute crabmeat or shrimp for the lobster.) A Craig Claiborne
