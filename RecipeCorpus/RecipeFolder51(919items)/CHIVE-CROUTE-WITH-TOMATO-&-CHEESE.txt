Categories: Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Sandwiches, Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
2 sl Round cheese bread
Butter
2 lg Ripe tomato slices
2 tb Fresh chives; chopped
2 sl Cheddar, mozzarella or Swiss
-cheese*
Salt and pepper; to taste
*Enough cheese to cover the tomatoes.

Lightly toast cheese bread (don't brown).  Butter bread and top each
slice with tomato slice.  Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle
about 1 ts. chives on top of each.

Top with cheese.  Place a few inches under a preheated broiler; broil
until cheese is melted and bubbling. Top croutes with remaining
chives and serve at once.

Enright suggests serving this as a snack or with soup for a light
lunch. She also suggests that, if serving this for brunch, a poached
egg be put atop each tomato before topping with the other ingredients.
