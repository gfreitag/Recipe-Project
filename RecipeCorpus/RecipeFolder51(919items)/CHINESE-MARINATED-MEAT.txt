Title: CHINESE MARINATED MEAT
Categories: Meats, Condiments
Yield: 1 Cup
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1/4 c  Dry sherry (cooking
-sherry will do)
2 tb Light soy sauce
1/4 c  Dark soy sauce
2 1/2 ts Sugar
1/4 c  Hoisin sauce
1 ts Curry powder
1/4 c  Pineapple juice,
-unsweetened (or use
-the juice from the
-can of pineapple chunks)
1/2 ts White pepper
2 tb Ginger root, cut into
-thin (1/8-inch) slices
MMMMM------------------------MEAT SKEWERS-----------------------------
1 1/2 lb Sirloin tip
12 oz Pineapple chunks
Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.

Cut meat into bite-size chunks and place on skewers with 2 or 3
chunks of pineapple in between the meat pieces. Marinate the skewers
overnight, in a covered container, in the refrigerator.

To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of
the chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on
skewers is even better.

NOTES:

*  Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade -- After frequenting a local
Chinese restaurant, I finally asked for the recipe for the marinade
for the meat that came on skewers on the pu pu platter. I was given a
list of ingredients with instructions like "heavy on this, light on
this". I devised my own amounts from this list. I served it to my
family and they enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending it to
mod.recipes.

*  You may need to double the marinade recipe.  I use a Tupperware
container made especially for marinating. Any container will do, but
it's tough having to turn over all those skewers.

*  The hoisin sauce, ginger root and light soy sauce should be
available in any good grocery store. Comments, revisions and/or
additions will be appreciated.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes
cooking. : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
