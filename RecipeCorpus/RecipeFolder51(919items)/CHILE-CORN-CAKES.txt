peppers, corn and onions for 23 minutes or until onions begin to
soften. Add the chili powder and cumin and continue cooking for 2
minutes, stirring constantly. Add the chicken stock to deglaze the
pan and continue cooking until most of the liquid has evaporated.

In a small bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder. Add the
cornmeal, egg, milk and butter and mix well until very smooth. Add
the corn mixture and cilantro and season to taste.
