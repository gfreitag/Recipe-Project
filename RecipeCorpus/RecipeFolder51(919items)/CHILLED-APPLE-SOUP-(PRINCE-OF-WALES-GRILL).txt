Recipe by: Jo Merrill * Peel, core, cut into eighths and set aside in
lemon water. Remove apples from water and place in 4-quart stock pot
with half the Reisling, half the Calvados and all remaining
ingredients except the cream and yogurt. Bring to a boil, and reduce
to a simmer. Cook for 20-30 minutes.  Remove from heat and force
contents of pot through strainer. Puree ingredients that remain in
strainer and return to the liquid. Chill soup over ice.  Whisk in
yogurt and cream and serve in iced glasses. Note: This recipe did not
say what to do with the remaining Reisling and Calvados. I think it
would be added after the soup is chilled if you wish a stronger taste
of those 2 ingredients. This recipe is from the world famous Prince
of Wales Grill at the Hotel Del Coronado in Coronado, California---Jo
