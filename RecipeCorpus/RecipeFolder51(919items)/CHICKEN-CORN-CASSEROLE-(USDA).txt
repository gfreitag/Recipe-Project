Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
1/2 c  Butter, margarine -- or

1 c  Unsifted flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
2 ts Instant minced onion
1 1/2 qt Hot chicken broth
2 1/4 lb Cooked chicken -- diced (7
Cups)
48 oz Whole kernal corn, drained
3    (16-oz) cans
6 oz Processed cheddar cheese --
Shredded (1 1/2 c)
3/4 c  Pimientos -- chopped
TOPPING FOR INDIVIDUAL
CASSEROLE ----
1/4 c  Fine dry breadcrumbs
1 tb Butter or margarine
Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

Melt fat.  Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and onion. Add broth slowly.
Cook until thickened, stirring constantly. Mix hot mixture with
chicken, corn, cheese, and pimentos.  Pour one-forth of mixture into
each baking pan. Spread well to avoid air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). For
each pan to be baked right away, mix 1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs
with 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine. Sprinkle over chicken
mixture in baking pan.  Bake 45 minutes or until crumbs are lightly
browned.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. For each pan to be baked,
mix 1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs with 1 tablespoon melted butter or
margarine. Sprinkle over chicken mixture in baking pan. Bake 1 1/4
hours or until crumbs are lightly browned, and center is hot.
