(Note:  make crepes *first*; then they'll be ready when the sauce and
filling are finished.)

Crepes: Mix all crepe ingredients in a bowl and beat with a rotary
beater till blended.

Heat a lightly greased 6-inch skillet.  Remove from heat. Spoon in
about 2 Tablespoons of batter; lift and tilt skillet to spread
batter. Return to heat; brown on one side only. (Or, cook on an
inverted crepe pan.) Invert pan over paper toweling; remove crepe.
Repeat to make 16- 18 crepes; greasing skillet occaionally.

Unfilled crepes freeze well, so if you have any remaining crepes,
store them in your freezer.  Just make a stack, alternating each
crepe with 2 layers of waxed paper. Then overwrap the stack in a
moisture-vaporproof bag.  Freeze up to 4 months.  Let crepes thaw at
room temperatur about1 hour before using.

Cheese sauce:  In a medium sucepan melt butter.  Stir in flour and
salt. Add milk, water and chicken bouillon granules all at once. Cook
and stir over medium heat till thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir
1-2 minutes more. Stir in cheese, wine, parsley and Tabasco. Remove 1
cup of the cheese sauce and set aside. Stir drained mushrooms into
remaining sauce.

Filling: Cook peas acording to package directions; drain. Combine
peas, chicken/turkey, pimiento and the 1 cup reserved cheese sauce.
Spread about 1/4 cup filling over the unbrowned side of each crepe,
leaving a 1/4-inch rim around edge.  Roll up crepe.  Place, seam side
down, in a 12x7x2 inch baking dish.  Repeat with remaining crepes.
Pour the remaining cheese sauce over crepes.  Sprinkle with paprika,
if desired. Cover; bake in a 375~ oven for 18-20 minutes or till
heated through. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
