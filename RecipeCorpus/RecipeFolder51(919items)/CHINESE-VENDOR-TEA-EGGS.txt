Recipe by: The Tea Book by Sara Perry and Judith Ann Rose
1. In a pot, cover the eggs with cold water and bring to a boil.
Simmer for 12 minutes. Remove from heat and reserve the water.

2. Place the eggs in cold water until they can be easily handled.
With the back of a spoon, lightly tap each shell all over
until it
is covered with a cobweb of cracks.

3. In the same pot, bring the reserved water (which should be 3
to 4
cups) to a boil. Add the tea leaves, 5-fragrance spice, salt
and
eggs. Simmer covered for an hour. Remove the pot from the heat
and
continue to let the eggs soak covered for 30 minutes. Remove
the
eggs from the water and halve them lengthwise or quarter them.
Their flavor is best enjoyed within 24 hours.

Makes 6 to 10 eggs.

NOTES:

In the Orient, tea eggs are often sold by street vendors as a tasty
snack. Their unusual appearance makes them a clever addition to any
picnic. Dusted with a combination of toasted sesame seeds and
coarse
salt, they make an excellent hors d'oeuvre.
