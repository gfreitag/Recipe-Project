Title: CHIN CH'IEN JOU (ROAST COIN PORK)
Categories: Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 lb Lean boneless pork *
6 oz Pork fat
2    Pieces scallion
-(6" long)
3    Slices ginger
1/4 ts 5 spice powder
2 tb Sugar
3 tb Soysauce
1 tb Wine (Kao-Liang)
1/2 tb Sesame oil
1/4 ts Black pepper
*(butt or loin)

Procedure:

1. Trim the meat into a round piede-1 1/2 inch diameter. Cut the
first slice almost through.  Cut the secon slice completely through.
Continue until you have 20 double pieces. (The shape should be like a
hamburger bun, that is one piece should not be cut completely
through). Cut the pork fat into 20 round pieces a little smaller than
the lean pork.

2. Place pork and fat into a bowl.  Add the crushed scallion and
ginger, five spice powder, sugar, soysauce, wine, sesame oil, and
pepper. Stir until the ingredients are well mixed. Soak about one
hour.

3. Put one slice of fat into each double slice of the lean pork. Put
the pieces on a skewer.  Don't put them too close together. Put the
skewer on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Roast the coin shape
pork for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. (after cooking for 15 minutes
remove and rub some of the marinade sauce on the pork and then return
to the oven). Remove the pork from oven and remove from the skewer.
Rub some oil on top.
Arrange on a platter in overlapping layers.

NOTE:  1.  Serve with Steamed Flower Shaped Rolls, which are in
Pei-Mei's Cook Book Volume I page 233. 2.
The skewer should be as long as a chopstick.
