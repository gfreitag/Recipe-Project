Remember the basic rule for chowing:  Have everything ready before you
light the wok.  Soak and prepare the vegetables, mix the sauce, and
then go to it.  Heat the wok and add the oil, salt, garlic, and
ginger. Chow for a moment and then add the vegetables.  Chow until
hot and tender and then add the sauce, the drained noodles, and the
chicken stock to the wok. Stir and simmer uncovered until the noodles
are clear and tender and have absorbed most of the broth.  Taste for
salt and place in a serving bowl. Garnish with green onions & serve.
