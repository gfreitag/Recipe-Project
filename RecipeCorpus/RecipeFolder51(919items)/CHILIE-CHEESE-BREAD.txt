-chilies; well-drained; *
I usually squeeze the chilies between a couple of layers of paper
towels to get rid of the excess moisture. If you don't want to use
green chilies, add about 1/2 tsp. of ground red pepper. Pour in all
ingredients (EXCEPT cheese and chilies) in the order listed (or if
your machine takes wet ingredients first, reverse the order) Select
white bread and push "Start". After the first knead, at the beeps,
add the chilies and the cheddar cheese. When the bread is finished
baking brush on some margarine or butter to the crust.
