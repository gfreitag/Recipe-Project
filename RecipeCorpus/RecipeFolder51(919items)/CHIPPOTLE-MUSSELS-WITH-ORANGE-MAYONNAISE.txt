To prepare the mussels, place in a large pot together with the garlic,
orange zest, chipotle, and water. Cover, bring to a boil and steam
for 4 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let sit for 5
minutes; mussels should then be open.  Remove the mussels and keep
covered in a warm place. Reduce the liquid by half and add the oil
and orange juice. Divide the mussels on the half-shell evenly between
soup plates and add the broth. Garnish each bowl with 1 Tbls of
Orange Mayonnaise and 3 sprigs of cilantro.

ORANGE MAYONNAISE:

Beat the egg yolk in a glass or stainless steel bowl until light and
lemon colored.  Transfer to a blender and add the oil drop by drop
fro the first 1/4 of a cup, then the remainder in a slow steady
stream, mixing at high speed until emulsified.  Add the other sauce
ingredients and blend together.  Let sit for at least 1 hour to allow
the orange flavor to develop. From The Coyote Cafe Cookbook by Mark
