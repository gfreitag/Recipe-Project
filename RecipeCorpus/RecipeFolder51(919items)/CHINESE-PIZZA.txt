This is from one of Martin Yan's books...  I haven't tried this, but
it looks pretty tasty.  In general, I don't care for Yan's recipes,
although I do get a kick out of his show. I don't know what it is,
but the few things I've made from this book just don't seem to quite
make it.

1.  To make crust:  Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let set
for 10 minutes.  Stir in oil and salt; add flour gradually. Knead
dough for 10 to 15 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in
greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts
until double in bulk (1 1/2 to 2 hours).  Punch down dough and roll
into thin crust. Make 2 pizzas of 12" diameter, 1/4" thickness. Place
crust on baking sheet.

2.  Combine ingredients for sauce and set aside.

3.Heat oil over high heat; put in garlic and ginger, stir for 5
seconds. Add remaining ingredients, except hoisin sauce, catsup and
sesame oil; reduce heat to medium-high. Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.
Add hoisin sauce and catsup and stir-fry for another minute.

4.  Spread sauce on dough, then top with stir-fried vegetables and
meat; brush sesame oil on top.

5.  Bake pizza at 375F for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve and
enjoy.

REMARKS: One cup of sausage is equal to 3 sausages. For a classier
pizza, add 1/2 cup sliced prawns For added hotness, put 1/2 teaspoon
hot chili oil into the sauce.
