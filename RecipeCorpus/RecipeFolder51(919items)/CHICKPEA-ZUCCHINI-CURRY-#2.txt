Title: CHICKPEA-ZUCCHINI CURRY #2
Categories: Indian, Instant ind, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
1    8oz can of tomato sauce
2 ts Instant India
1/4 ts Mashed garlic
1/4 c  Raisons
1    16oz can drained garbanzo
-beans
1    Piece sliced seitan
Microwaved covered for 10 minutes.

Added: 1 large zucchini, sliced into large triangular wedges.

Microwaved covered for a further 8 minutes.

Served with some yogurt cheese (non-fat yogurt drained for 24 hours
until reduced to half it's bulk) mixed in, which gives it a creamy
sauce.

Note that seitan is *not* an authentic Indian ingredient--they would
use panir, a solid whey cheese curded with yogurt and lemon, but I've
found that seitan blends nicely with Indian food and of course has
very little fat.
