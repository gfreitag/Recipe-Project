COMBINE ONION, garlic, cloves, coriander, pepper, salt and brandy in a
small saucepan and place over high heat on the stove. The brandy will
ignite. Cook, gently shaking the pan, until the alcohol burns off.
Remove from the heat and transfer the contents of the pan to a mixing
bowl. Grind the chicken, veal and bacon in a meat grinder fitted with
medium holes and add it to the mixing bowl. Add the egg whites and
mix everything together well. Stuff the sausages into casings, form
them into sausage patties, or form them into sausages by wrapping
them in heatproof plastic wrap. If using the plastic wrap method,
poach the sausages in rapidly boiling water for 2 minutes. Let them
cool, gently unwrap them and proceed to either grill or saute them.
