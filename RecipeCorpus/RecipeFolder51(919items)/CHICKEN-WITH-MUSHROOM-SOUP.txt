-garnish
Saute the mushrooms in the butter.  Add to the soup stock along with
the chicken and rice.  Cook until the rice is puffy, and serve with a
little lemon juice and chopped green onions in a bowl.

To make the chicken stock, simply boil some chicken in water until
the meat is falling off the bones.  Remove the chicken and the liquid
left is the stock.  To make this soup extra low fat, chill the broth
and skim off the fat that solidifies on top.

THis is a very simple but very delicious soup.
