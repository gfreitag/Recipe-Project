Heat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a broiler pan with foil. In
blender container or food processor, combine all roast pork
ingredients except pork.  Blend until smooth. Generously brush both
sides of the the pork steaks, reserving the remaining sauce.  Place
the pork steaks on the foil-line pan; bake 30 minutes.  Brush both
sides of pork with remaining sauce and bake 10 to 20 minutes more
until tender. Let cool. Finely chop the meat.

In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and sherry.  Blend well. Heat the
oil in a wok and stir-fry onion and water chestnuts until the onion
begins to brown.  Add soy and hoisin; stir to coat. Add the chicken
broth and stir in the cornstarch mixture.  Cook and stir until
thickened. Remove from heat; stir in pork.

Separate the dough into 8 biscuits.  Press or roll each into a 5-inch
circle on a lightly floured surfance. Place about 1/3 cup of the pork
mixture in the center and gather up the edges, pinch and twist to
seal. Place seam side down on an ungreased cookie sheet. In a small
bowl, beat the glaze ingredients until blended; brush over buns. Bake
at 375 until golden brown.  8 sandwiches.
