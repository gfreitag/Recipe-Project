Cut as small a slit as possible in one side of each chile to remove
seeds. Leave stems on. Pat chiles dry with paper towels.

Cut cheese into long thin sticks, one for each chile. Place one stick
in each chile, using more if chiles are large. If chiles are loose
and open, wrap around cheese and fasten with wooden picks.

Pour oil 1/4" deep into large skillet. Heat oil to 365Ã¸ F. Beat egg
whites in a medium bowl until stiff. Beat egg yolks lightly in a
small bowl and add all at once to beaten egg whites. Fold lightly but
thoroughly. Roll chiles in flour, then dip in egg mixture to coat.
Fry in hot oil until golden brown, turning with a spatula. Drain on
paper towels. Serve immediately topped with tomato sauce.

Tomato Sauce: Combine tomatoes, onion and garlic in blender or food
pro- cessor; puree. Heat oil in a medium saucepan, add tomato
mixture. Cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add broth, salt,
chiles, cloves and cinnamon. Simmer gently 15 minutes.
