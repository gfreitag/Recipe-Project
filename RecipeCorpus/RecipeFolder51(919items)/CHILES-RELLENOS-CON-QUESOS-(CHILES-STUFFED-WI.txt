chilies in a damp cloth to steam for five minutes. Pull peeling off.

Slit green chiles. Cut cheese into slices that will fit into the green
chile slits. (Be sure to remove seeds and membrane)

Prepare a batter by using one egg for every two chiles and one tsp of
hot water to each egg, plus enough flour (1 tbsp per egg) to make a
thin batter. Beat egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold in
beaten egg yolks and flour.

Drop the batter (the size of a 6-in.x4-in.oval) onto a greased fry
pan. Place a stuffed chile on it and cover with batter. Cook over low
heat until golden. Turn with spatula and brown on other side. Drain
on paper towels. Place in baking dish, cover with sauce, and top with
grated cheese.
