Title: CHILI-MARINATED PORK
Categories: Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Pasillo chilis, ground
1 ts Salt, coarse or Kosher
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
2 tb Oil, vegetable
1 tb Lime juice, fresh
3 cl Garlic, minced
2 lb Pork tenderloin
Mix chili, de-seeded*, salt,& cumin in small bowl. Stir in oil and
lime juice to make a smooth paste. Add garlic. Butterfly the port by
cutting lengthwise and 2/3 of the way through, leaving meat in one
piece; spread meat flat.  Cut tenderloin crosswise into 6 equal
pieces. Place port betwen pieces of plastic wrap and pound with meat
mallet to 1/4 in. thickness. Spread chili paste on both sides of pork
pieces to coat evenly. Place in shallow glass baking dish. Marinate,
covered in fridge or 3 hours. Prepare grill. Grill pork for 8-10
mins. turning once. *Toast dried peppers before mixing paste.  Heat
ungreased heavy skillet over med. heat, place chilies in the skillet
in a single layer. Cook for 2 minutes the color changes slightly,
press down with a spatula and turn occasionally. When chilies cool
enough to handle, cut each one open and pull out the seeds and
ribbing.  You could skip the toasting of the chilies, but remove the
seeds.I always add more chilies because I like it really hot. Posted
