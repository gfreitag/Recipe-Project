Title: CHILIPETIN SAUCE
Categories: Mexican, Sauces, Spices
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Green chili pequin peppers
-(ROAST 'EM!)
1 md Onion
1    Clove garlic
1    Green tomato (or tomatillo,
-but use a couple or so if
-using these)
1 ts Flour
1 c  Vinegar
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
Grind fine or chop the peppers, onion, garlic and tomato. Add the
flour

Bring the vinegar, sugar, and salt to a boil. Pour over the pepper
mixture and, stirring occasionally, boil, uncovered, for about 30
minutes, or until it thickens slightly. Seal while hot in sterilized
jars. The sauce will be thin, but will thicken with age. (like most
of us!)

Serve this as a condiment at your next Mexican cookout, with fajitas,
pinto beans, cornbread, and coleslaw. Makes 1 pint.

ENJOY!
