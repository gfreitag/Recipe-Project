:

The kick in honey glazed nuts comes from two chilies: cayenne and
chipotle.

The nuts: hazelnuts (filberts), almonds, pine, macadamias, recans,
pistachios, walnuts.

TO ROAST: Spread shelled nuts (except macadamias) in a single layer
on a baking pan. Bake in a 350F oven, stirring often, until golden.
Allow 5 to 7 minutes for pine nuts; 8 to 10minutes for pecans,
pistachios, and walnuts; about 15 minutes for almonds and hazelnuts.

Macadamias need lower heat because they scorch very easily; roast
them at 300F about 20 minutes. Watch nuts carefully since they brown
quickly. For more toasted flavor, bake nuts to a darker color.

1. Remove and discard chili stems. Whirl chilies, with seeds, in a
blender or food processor until finely ground.

2. In a bowl, mix ground chilies, honey, sugar, oil, salt, and
cayenne. Add nuts and stir until coated with seasonings.

3. Pour nuts onto oiled 10- by 15-inch pan- shake into 1 layer. Bake
in a 300F oven, stirring often, till golden brown (under skins, if
not blanched) and honey mixture hardens, 25to 30 minutes. If
necessary, push nuts apart; cool in pan. Serve, or store up to 3 days.

Makes 3 cups

To Blanch:  Remove shells. Immerse nuts in rapidly boiling water
until the skins shrivel and loosen, 15 to 20 seconds. Drain; set
aside to cool. The skin should slip off easily when rubbed or pinched
off.
