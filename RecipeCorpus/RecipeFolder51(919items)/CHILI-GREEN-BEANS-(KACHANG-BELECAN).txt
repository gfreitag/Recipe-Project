Title: CHILI GREEN BEANS (KACHANG BELECAN)
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
225 g  Green Beans
Sambal Oelek -to taste
Slice beans into bite-sized pieces.  Put in a pyrex microwave bowl
with a few drops of water.  Microwave on high for about 2 minutes.
Add sambal oelek and microwave on high for a further 1 minute. Serve
with rice. Serves 1 as a vegetarian meal with rice, or 2-3 as a
side-dish.

NOTES:Sambal Oelek is a crushed chili paste, with garlic, onion, rice
vinegar and such.  The original recipe would have sambal belecan
rather than sambal oelek (hence the name), but I have not come
accross this, and this substitute is just as good.
