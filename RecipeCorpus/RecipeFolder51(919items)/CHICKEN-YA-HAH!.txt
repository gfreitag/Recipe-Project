Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman Chicken "Ya-hah!" Saute the
celery, onions and garlic in the oils while you cut the chicken into
bite-sized pieces. When the onion is translucent add the chicken,
celery seed, jalapenos and water chestnuts. Saute until chicken is
barely done... add the remaining ingredients, cover and simmer for an
hour. Serve over either cornbread, rice or pasta... they're all good.
Enjoy!
