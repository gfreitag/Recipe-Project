salt. Remove from heat; let cool in cooking liquid for about 1 hour.

2. If using cumin seeds, toast in a dry pan over medium-low heat
until they release their aroma, about 2 minutes. Let cool and grind
to a powder in a spice grinder. Set aside.

3. Chop together 1/2 t salt, the garlic, and 1/2 t olive oil to form a
paste. Add chiles; chop to combine. Transfer to a small bowl and add
remaining oil.

4. Drain soaked chickpeas. If using canned chickpeas, rinse.) Combine
with 1 t chile mixture, or to taste. Add olives, cumin, lemon juice,
and salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve. The
salsa can be made 1 day ahead (return to room temperature before
serving).

5. Just before serving, coarsely chop arugula and toss with salsa.
