Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings

6 lg Mandarines
2 tb Orange flower water
Icing sugar
This fruit salad couldn't be simpler or more delicious after a rich
main course. Orange-flower water can be bought in Greek and Lebanese
food stores.

Zest 2 large or 4 small mandarines, peel 4 large or 8 small without
segmenting them and remove as much pith from the fruit as possible.
Slice into rounds, removing the pips, and overlap the slices in a
serving dish, conserving any juice. sprinkle with the zest and about
2 tablespoons orange-flower water, dust with icing sugar, cover with
cling film and leave to macerate in the refrig- erator for a couple
of hours. Taste the juices and adjust if necessary with sugar or a
little lemon juice. Chill again and serve.
