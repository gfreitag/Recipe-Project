Title: CHINESE FRIED PECANS
Categories: Desserts, Cathe
Yield: 12 Servings
4 c  Pecan halves
6 c  Water, boiling (or more)
1 c  Sugar
2 c  Oil
NOTE:  This dish must be started a full 24 hours before you plan to
serve it.

Put pecans in a large pot or heat-proof bowl.  Cover with boiling
water and let them soak 3 minutes.  Drain the pecans and spread them
in a single layer on a large platter or non-rusting cookie sheet.
Cover with sugar and stir until pecans are completely coated with the
sugar. (The sugar will dissolve slightly.)  You might have to add
water if the nuts are too dry for the sugar to stick.

Transfer the sugared nuts to a dry platter and set them aside to
air-dry overnight.  They really need to dry for 24 hours.

When ready to serve the pecans, bring the oil almost to the smoking
point in a wok or large pot.  Fry one quarter of them at a time,
being careful not to let them burn. The sugar will melt. Carefully
remove the cooked nuts from the hot oil with a strainer and put them
on a heatproof glass platter. Fry each quarter of the nuts
individually so all of them will get hot enough for the sugar to
melt. Serve immediately.
