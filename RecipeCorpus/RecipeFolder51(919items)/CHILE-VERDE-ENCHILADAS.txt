Recipe by: JHALAPI@WAYNEST1.BITNET Coarsely chop and combine the
chiles and the onion. Saute in the butter until the onion is
translucent (about 3 minutes). Remove from the heat. Set aside. Bring
the milk to a boil in a (2 1/2 Qt.) saucepan. Coarsely chop or cube
the cheese in a blender or food processor. Add the flour and 1/6 of
the hot milk to the work bowl. Process to a paste-like consistency.
Add the remaining milk into the work bowl. Process until smooth,
pausing every so often to scrape the sides of the work bowl. Return
the mixture to the saucepan. Cook, stirring steadily, over medium
heat until smooth and thickened (about 1 minute). Add salt and
pepper. To assemble the enchiladas: heat about 1/2" of oil in a
skillet large enou to accommodate the tortillas. Preheat the oven to
350 degrees. Heat the oil in the skillet to 300 degrees. Pass the
tortillas, one at a time, through the oil to soften and seal them. DO
NOT ALLOW THEM TO BECOME CRISP! Press between paper towels to drain.
Fill each tortilla with 1 1/2 tablespoons each of chicken and the
chile and onion mixture. Roll each tortilla up. Place the tortillas,
seam side down, in a baking dish large enough to accommodate them.
Cover. Bake about 10 minutes. Uncover. Top with the sauce. Bake for
another 8 minutes. Serve immediately garnished with minced scallions
