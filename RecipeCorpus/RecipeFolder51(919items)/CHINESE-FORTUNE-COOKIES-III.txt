Title: CHINESE FORTUNE COOKIES III
Categories: Chinese, Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 48 Servings
3    Large egg whites
3/4 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 lb Butter, melted
1/4 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Almond extract
1 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2 tb Water
Combine egg whites, sugar & salt. Beat in, one ingredient at a time,
the butter, extracts, flour & water. Blend thoroughly & chill for 20
minutes.Preheat to 350 deg. Do just 2 or 3 cookies at a time. Drop
slightly rounded teaspoonsful of thick batter for each cookie onto a
lightly greased cookie sheet. Spread the dough very thin, using the
back of the spoon, making rounds about 3 inches in diameter. Bake for
5 min., or until the edges begin to brown lightly. Remove to a wire
rack. Working quickly, place a fortune in the center of each cookie.
Fold opposite sides together, crease crosswise at the center of the
straight edge to form a flattened side, then bend backward for the
traditional shape. Cool in muffin tins or small glasses to hold
shape. Makes about 4 dozen. Shared by Micheal Kean, Prodigy ID#
