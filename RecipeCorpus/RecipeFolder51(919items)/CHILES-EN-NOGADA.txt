Make a vertical slit down the side of each chile and carefully remove
the seeds, leaving the stem intact.  Mix the veal and pork in a bowl.
Add the salt and pepper.  In a large heavy skillet, over a medium
heat, cook the oil with the onion until translucent.  Add the ground
meat and cook, breaking up any clumps, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the
almonds, pine nuts, cactus, raisins, and epazote.  Cook and stir
constantly, until the meat is done.  Remove the meat mixture from the
heat and let cool. Stuff the chiles with the meat mixture and put
them on an ovenproof platter, covered with loosely tented foil. Place
the platter in a warm oven while finishing the sauce. Place the
walnuts in a blender. With the motor running, add the milk slowly,
until smooth and thick.  Add the cream and blend well. Cover the
chiles with the walnut sauce and garnish with the pomegranate seeds
and parsley.
