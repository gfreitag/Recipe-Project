1 ts Salt
2    Scallions, chopped
1/2 c  Fresh shrimp, shelled,

2 tb Soy sauce
Heat 2 tablespoons lard or cooking oil. Beat eggs with 1/2 teaspoon
salt and scramble in oil until firm, breaking into small pieces.
Remove and reserve. Heat remaining oil. Add scallion and shrimp and
remaining salt. Ch'ao until shrimp shows pink. Break up lumps of cold
cooked rice. Add to shrimp. Stir until rice is heated and the grains
of rice are separated. Make a hole in the center of the rice. Add all
the rest of the ingredients except soy sauce. Stir until thoroughly
heated and mixed. Sprinkle soy sauce over rice and mix evenly
through. Salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with additional chopped
scallions if desired.

Note: The secret of making fried rice lies in the use of cold, cooked
rice. Freshly cooked rice will only produce a sticky mess.
