Approx. Cook Time: 1 1) Heat
Fat grams    per serving:
oil and brown chicken pieces on all sides over fairly high heat along
with the garlic cloves. (Leave garlic to one side to avoid burning;
remove if it appears it may burn.) Brown chicken in batches to avoid
crowding. Remove chicken to a warm platter and salt and pepper it on
all sides. 2) Tilt the pan and discard all but one tablespoon of the
cooking fat. Add onion to the pan and cook over medium high heat for
2 to 3 minutes, until wilted. Add tomato and chile or chile powder
and saute a minute or two. Add wine and let the wine cook down for a
couple of minutes. 3) Return chicken to the pan. Add pepper strips
and herbs. Bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, cover and cook
until the chicken is fork tender, 30 to 45 minutes for a young fryer.
If juices are too thin, uncover and raise heat until reduced to
desired consistency, removing chicken first if it is already done. 4)
Let the dish stand uncovered for 5 to
10    minutes before serving.
