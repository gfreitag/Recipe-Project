If you like an assertive chili-based relish, try this flavorful one on
nearly any white-fleshed fish (whole, steaks or fillets). Like it
hotter? Add some more chilies!

Grill chilies 4 to 5 inches from hot coals until soft and the skin
ruptures.  Let cool slightly; rub skin off. Seed and cut into a coarse
dice.  Add remaining ingredients and let sit while fish cooks. May be
made the day before.  Serve cold or at room temperature.

Makes 1 cup.
