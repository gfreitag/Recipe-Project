Here's one that looks feasible for just about any American kitchen.
Cut the chicken into 4 pieces. Season and fry until the flesh turns
white, then sprinkle with flour.  Add the liquid from the crushed
ginger and then add the wine and water to cover the chicken. Bring to
a boil and allow to simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the chicken pieces
and lower the heat of the fire.  Strain the liquid, check the
seasoning and add the coconut milk. Serve very hot with boiled white
rice.
