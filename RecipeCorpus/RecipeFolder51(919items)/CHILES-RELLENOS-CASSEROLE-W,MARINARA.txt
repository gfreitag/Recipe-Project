Categories: Chili, Mexican
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lb Jack cheese, cut in strips
1 cn 4 oz green chiles, seeded
4    Eggs
1/3 c  Milk
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
1 cn Marinara sauce
Pitted ripe olives(garnish)
Stuff chilies w/jack cheese.  Arrange chilies side-by-side in greased
shallow 1 1/2 qt. baking dish.

Beet eggs until thick and foamy, add milk, flour and baking powder -
blend.

Pour egg batter over chiles - cover all chiles with batter. Sprinkle
with cheddar cheese.  Bake uncovered @ 375 30 minutes or until set.
Serve with heated marinara sauce and olives.

Note: I used 18 fresh Anaheim chilies (1.5 pds). Blistered under
broiler until popped and brown.  Then peeled and seeded.

I also increased the recipe by half.  Very good.
