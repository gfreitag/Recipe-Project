Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Lean beef
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Garlic powder
4    Tomatoes
1 1/2 ts Shortening
1/2    Onion, chopped
1/2    Bell pepper, chopped
1 1/2 ts Flour
1/2 c  Canned whole green

4 fl Tortillas

1 c  Sour cream

Cut the beef into 4 pieces. Place in a 5 to 6-quart pan and add water
to cover. Bring to a boil; skim the foam from the surface. Add the
salt, pepper, and garlic. Simmer until tender, approximately 1-1/2 to
2 hours. Drain the beef, reserving 1/2 cup of the broth. When the
meat is cool, shred. Chop 2 of the tomatoes. Melt the shortening in a
pan over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and saute until
tender. Add the flour, whisking until no lumps remain, and cook 2
minutes. Add the shredded beef, reserved broth, chopped tomatoes, and
whole chiles. Simmer 15 minutes. Place about 1/2 cup of the meat
mixture in a line down the center of each tortilla. Fold both ends
over 1 inch to 2 inch; fold one side over the other and roll up in a
neat package. Secure with a toothpick. Deep fry in very hot oil 400'F
until crisp and well browned. Drain on paper towels. Preheat the
broiler. Place the chimichangas on an ovenproof plater or in a baking
pan. Spoon red chili sauce over liberally. Sprinkle with grated
cheese and green onion. Place under the broiler until the cheese
melts. Combine the sour cream and the whipping cream. Slice the
remaining 2 tomatoes. Top the chimichangas with the sour cream
mixture and Guacamole. Garnish with shredded lettuce, sliced tomato
and olives.
