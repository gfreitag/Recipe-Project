Title: CHILI ENCHILADAS
Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
Yield: 10 Servings
42 oz Tofu, firm; frozed & thawed
20    Corn tortillas; * see note
Marinade:
1/3 c  Soy sauce, low sodium
3 tb Tomato sauce; low-sodium
3 tb Peanut butter; ** see note
3 ts Onion powder
2 ts Chili powder
Enchilada sauce
1 lg Yellow onion; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
24 oz Tomato sauce; * see note
3 c  Water
3 tb Chili powder
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water; cold
Preparation Time: 1:30 Squeeze the excess water from the thawed tofu
and tear the tofu into pieces. Mix the next five ingredients
together, pour over the tofu, and mix well. Cook and stir in a large
saucepan over medium to high heat until slightly browned, stirring
constantly. Set aside. To make the sauce, saute the onion and garlic
in a small amount of water until translucent, add the remaining
ingredients, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Dissolve the
cornstarch in the cold water and gradually add to the sauce while
stirring. Cook and stir until sauce boils and thickens. Preheat the
oven to 350 degreees. Pour about 1 cup of the sauce into the bottom
of a 15" X 10" baking dish or two smaller baking dishes. Place 1/3
cup of the tofu mixture down the center of each burrito shell, roll
up, and place in the baking dish. Repeat until all burritos are
filled and rolled. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the filled
burritos and bake for 30 minutes.

VARIATION: For added richness, sprinkle with some grated soy cheese
and sliced olives before baking.
