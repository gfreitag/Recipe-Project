Title: CHILI-CILANTRO DRESSING (MCDOUGALL)
Categories: Digest, Jan., Mcdougall
Yield: 1 Servings
1    4-ounce can of chopped
Green chilies
1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
1    To 2 cloves garlic
2 ts Honey
Freshly ground pepper to
Taste
Place all of the ingredients in a food processor or blender. Process
until smooth.

Note: I copied the above.  I used fresh green chilies, dry cilantro
from a jar ( a little less than 1/4 cup), lemon juice instead of
lime, and no pepper.  EVERYONE loved the dressing.

Enjoy.  And I definitely recomment the New Mcdougall cookbook. The
recipes are not complicated and there is something for everyone.
