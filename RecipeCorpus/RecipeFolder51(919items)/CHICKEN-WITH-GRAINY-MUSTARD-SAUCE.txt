Reduce heat so liquid is at a bare simmer. Poach, adjusting heat to
maintain simmer and slimming skum off the top, until chicken is
sooked, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove chicken from stock; use a sharp
knife to remove meat from bones. Place meat in a dish. Add stock to
just cover. Return bones to pot; simmer until very flavorful, about 1
hour. Pass stock through a cheesclothe lined strainer and discard
solids. In a clean saucepan, return stock to a boil. Reduce heat so
stock is at a bare simmer. Add apricots and pineapple and poach until
tender, about 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove fruit; season
with salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 teaspoon tarragon. Raise
heat to high, cook stock until reduced to 1/3 cup, 45 minutes. Reduce
heat to low; whisk in mustard, 1/4 teaspoon each salt and tarragon
and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Divide lettuce among four plates. Slice
chicken, place on greens. Pour mustard sauce over chicken and serve
with reserved apricot and pineapple mixture.
