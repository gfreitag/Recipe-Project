Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Chickpeas -- cooked
1/2 lb Green Beans
-Dressing For Chickpeas-----
1/3 c  Oil
1/4 c  Wine Vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Garam Masala
2    Cloves Garlic -- crushed
1/8 ts Cayenne

1/4 c  Oil
2 tb Lemon Juice
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Garam Masala

1 ts Fresh Ginger Root -- grated
Heat chickpeas in their liquid and drain. Place in a bowl. Combine all
ingredients for chickpea dressing and pour over chickpeas while they
are still warm. Mix well. Cool, cover and set aside. Combine all
ingredients for green bean dressing. Wash and trim beans, and cut
into 3/4-inch long pieces. Steam or boil beans until just tender.
Drain thoroughly. Shake them in a colander until they look very dry.
Put beans in a separate bowl from chickpeas and pour bean dressing
over them. Let sit for 5 minutes. Combine the two beans and mix well.
It's best to let the chickpeas sit in their dressing for several
hours before mixing them with the green beans so the chickpeas can
absorb the flavors. Serve cold or at room temperature.
