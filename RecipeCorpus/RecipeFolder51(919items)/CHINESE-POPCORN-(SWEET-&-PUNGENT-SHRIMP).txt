A reader who requested the recipe for a sweet and pungent shrimp from
the Panda Inn in Pasadena won the everlasting thanks of our tasting
panel. Because it's as impossible to eat just one of these as it is
to eat a single kernel of popcorn, the recipe is often called Chinese
popcorn.

Peel and devein the shrimp.  Slice in halves lengthwise. Rinse well
and pat dry.  Add the egg white to the shrimp and mix well. Mix
1-1/2tablespoons cornstarch with salt and add to shrimp. Stir to coat
well. Add 1-1/2 tablespoons oil and mix well again. Place the shrimp
in a bowl and refrigerate at least 2 hours.Remove the shrimp and dust
with remaining cornstarch.  Shrimp should be dry to the touch. Heat
the remaining oil in a large wok to 350 to 375 degrees. Fry the
shrimp 1-1/2 to 2 minutes until crisp, being careful to separate them
with a long- handled wooden spoon or chopsticks to prevent sticking.
It may be necessary to fry the shrimp in several batches.  When done,
remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain well.  Combine the
shrimp and the sweet and pungent sauce and toss quickly to coat.
Immediately turn out onto a platter and sprinkle with finely chopped
green onions. SWEET AND PUNGENT SAUCE: Combine the sugar, catsup,
vinegar, and salt, and set aside. Heat the oil in a wok. Add the
garlic, ginger, green onion, red pepper, and zests of lemon and
orange; cook 30 seconds.  Stir in the sugar-catsup mixture.
Immediately add the sherry mixture and cook until slightly thickened.
