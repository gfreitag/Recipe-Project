Ancho chilies (sometimes called pasilla chilies) are sweet and fairly
mild. In this recipe, they give the chili a rich, dark color and
provide a unique, slightly spicy flavor. Remove stems and seeds from
chilies. Coarsely chop chilies. Place in bowl, cover with boiling
beef broth and let steep for 30 minutes. Heat oil in large Dutch
oven, add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and lightly
browned. Add garlic, salt and beef cubes.  Cook, stirring constantly,
just until beef loses its pink color. Strain chilies, reserving
liquid and chilies. Stir 2.5 cups of chili liquid into beef.  Stir in
chili powder and ground cumin seed and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat
and simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat for 1 hour, stirring
occasionally. Place soaked chilies and remaining liquid in blender
container, cover and blend until smooth. (If necessary, add 1/2 cup
more of water to make blending easier.) Add mixture to beef and cook
over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until
meat is tender. If a thicker chili is desired, gradually stir in
cornmeal 1 tbs at a time then cook, stirring constantly, until
thickened. Taste and season with salt as desired. Remove from heat
and ladle into bowls. Serve with a variety of condiments such as
chopped yellow peppers, red onions, tomatoes, avocado, fresh lime
juice or grated cheese. From: Fleurette Delisle Date: Mon, 01-1
