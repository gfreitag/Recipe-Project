Title: EGYPTIAN RICE & LENTILS
Categories: Arabic, Crockpot, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Brown lentils; washed &
-picked over
3/4 ts Salt
4 1/2 ts Olive oil
1 lg Onion; chopped
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 tb Cumin, ground
1/2 c  Rice
5 c  ;Water, to 6 cups
Place the olive oil (all of it) into the bottom of the crock pot.
Turn the pot onto the highest setting (if variable available) and add
the onions. Allow the onions 10-15 minutes to warm in the oil.  Add
the remaining ingredients, including the water. If cooking the dish
all day (i.e., a morning start), reduce heat to low; otherwise leave
on high setting. Cover. Leave to simmer.

Come home to a wonderful smelling house.  Stir the dish while in the
crock. If it is dry, add a little water.  If it's soup-like, remove
lid for a little while, or turn heat to high setting. Serve. It's
tasty as a main mean or as a pilaf to accompany other meals.

I got the basic recipe from Martha's book "Mediterranean Light"--p.
253.

It's one of my all time faves. And I used to think I hated lentils!
