Title: EGGPLANT CURRY
Categories: Main dish, African, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lg Eggplants, peeled & cubed
2 ts Salt
2 lg Onions, chopped
2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
4 tb Oil
1 ts Cumin seeds, crushed
1 ts Coriander
3 ea Cardamom pods
2 ts Ginger, grated
1/2 ts Turmeric
1 ts Salt
2 ea Chili peppers, crushed
3 lg Potatoes, chopped
1 ea Tomato, peeled & chopped
1 ts Tomato paste
Sprinkle eggplant pieces with salt & set aside for 6 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile in a large skillet, saute onions & garlic in the oil until
golden, stirring & ensuring that it's not scorching. Add all the
spices & peppers & stir-fry a couple of minutes. Squeeze eggplant
pieces to get rid of excess moisture.  Dump the pieces into the pot.
Stir until they become limp & slightly golden. Add more oil if
necessary Add the potatoes & let them brown on all sides. When
potatoes are somewhat tender, but still fork resistant, add tomatoes,
paste & 1 1/2 c water.  Stir, bring to a boil, reduce heat & simmer
until vegetables are tender but not mushy. The sauce should be thick,
like syrup. If too thin, simmer a little longer. Serve over rice.
