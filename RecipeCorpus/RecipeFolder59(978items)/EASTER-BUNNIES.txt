Preheat oven to 180C,350F, Gas Mark 4. Grease individual
castle-pudding moulds.

Put margarine, sugar, flour and eggs in a bowl. Combine ingredients,
then beat well until mixture is light in colour and texture. Stir in
orange rind and juice.

Divide mixture between moulds, filling each about halfway (tap tins so
mixture reaches bottom). Stand tins on a baking tray and bake in
preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until golden brown and well risen.
Turn on to a wire tray and leave to cool.

Beat butter until soft, then gradually add icing sugar, beating
ingredients together to give a soft, creamy consistency.

Trim bases of cakes so they stand level. Holding each cake on a fork,
spread buttercream over the top and sides, then roll cake in
dessicated coconut to coat. Use blanched almonds, glace cherries,
angelica strips and currants to mae bunnies' ears, noses, whiskers
and eyes.
