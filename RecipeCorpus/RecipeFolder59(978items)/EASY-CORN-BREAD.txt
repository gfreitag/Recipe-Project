Title: EASY CORN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 c  All purpose flour
3/4 c  Corn meal
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Milk
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 ea Egg, beaten
Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Grease 8 or 9 inch baking pan. Combine dry
ingredients.  Stir in milk, oil and egg, mixing just until dry
ingredients are moistened. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 20 -
25 minutes or until lightly brown and wooden tooth pick inserted near
center comes out clean. Serve warm.  Serves 9. Microwave directions:
Mix ingredients same as above and pour batter into UNGREASED pan.
Microwave on HIGH 5 - 6 minutes, rotating 1/4 turn after 2 minutes.
Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
Hope this is simple enough.....  As the recipe says...only mix
ingredients until moistened.  If you beat it too much it would come
out solid rather than light and airy. I cover the baking pan with
Saran Wrap leaving part of one corner pulled back for steam to get
out when I put it in the microwave...seems to help it bake more
evenly. The center will seem a little soggy when you take it out but
remember it continues to cook during that 5 minutes before you serve
it. Time also makes a difference depending on the wattage of your
micro. I think I leave mine in for about 7 minutes.
