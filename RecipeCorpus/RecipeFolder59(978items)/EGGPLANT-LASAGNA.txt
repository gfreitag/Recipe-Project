MIX THE OIL WITH THE OREGANO, basil, salt and pepper. Brush it onto
both sides of the eggplant and zucchini. Lay the eggplant and
zucchini in single layers on baking sheets. Broil them 2 inches from

side with the oil, and broil until the second side is done. Remove.
Preheat oven to 350F. Place half the eggplant slices in a wide,
shallow 2-or-3-quart baking dish. Add half the zucchini, then layer
in half of the mozzarella, ricotta, spaghetti sauce, fennel seed and
Parmesan. Repeat the layering with the second half of the
ingredients. Cover and bake 20-to-25 minutes or until hot and bubbly.
