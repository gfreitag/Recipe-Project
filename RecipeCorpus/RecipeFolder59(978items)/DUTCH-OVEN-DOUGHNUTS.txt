Title: DUTCH OVEN DOUGHNUTS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Flour
3/4 c  Milk
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1 tb Cooking oil
2 ts Cream of tarter
1/2 ts Powdered ginger
1/2 ts Powdered cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
Combine all ingredients into a smooth dough, rolled flat to 1/2"
thickness. Using can covers (or what you have <doughnut cutter*>) cut
into doughnut shape, using additional flour to keep dough from
sticking. If no suitable doughnut cutters are available, cut into 2"
squares. Fry in hot fat <cooking oil*> until golden brown. Drain on
absorbent paper. While frying, keep the fat hot enough to actively
bubble.

(note -- <*> indicates "translations" I've added)  I would roll the
fried doughnuts in sugar to "finish them". Oh WOW!! Dobi just handed
me a big plate of Shrimp Scampi!! See ya!! Gary
