Sift flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and
add eggs and water. Using a fork, stir the dough until it just holds
together and leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a floured
surface and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 mins or, if you
prefer, use the dough hook on your mixer or food processor). Cover
the dough and allow to rest for at least 30 mins.

Divide the dough into 4 parts. Dust your pastry board lightly with
cornstarch and roll each piece of dough out to an 11 x 14-inch
rectangle. Cut the 14-inch length into 4 equal parts and the 11-inch
length into 3 equal parts ( you will have 12 3 1/2-inch squares of
dough). Stack on a plate (the cornstarch will prevent sticking).
Repeat with the remaining 3 part of dough.

If you are not going to use right away, wrap securely and freeze.
