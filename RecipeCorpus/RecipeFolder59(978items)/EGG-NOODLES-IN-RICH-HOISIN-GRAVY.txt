Title: EGG NOODLES IN RICH HOISIN GRAVY
Categories: Pasta, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Hoisin sauce
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Asian sesame oil, divided
2 tb Peanut or vegetable oil
2 ea Large cloves garlic, minced
1 tb Minced ginger
1 lb Pork, boneless loin, minced
1 tb Chinese rice wine
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 ts Chili oil or to taste
1 lb Fresh Chinese egg noodles
1 ds Salt
2 ea Pickling cucumbers
3 c  Chicken broth or stock
1 1/2 c  Beans sprouts, blanched
To prepare: pickling cucumbers, peel, seed, and cut into strips
1/8-inch wide and 2-inches long. Mix cornstarch with 4 tablespoons
stock or water. Cook's notes: The Chinese would use egg noodles, but
you can substitute readily available Japanese ramen noodles. Hoisin
sauce, Asian sesame oil and chili oil are available at Asian markets
or supermarkets with large Asian specialty sections. Procedure: In a
bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, half the sesame oil
and the chicken stock. Heat the peanut oil in a wok and stir-fry the
garlic and ginger for 45 seconds, or until soft. Add the pork and
stir-fry until nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Add the rice wine and
stir-fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the broth mixture and bring to a
boil. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and return the entire mixture to
a boil; it will thicken slightly. Add chili oil to taste and keep the
gravy warm. Cook the noodles in boiling salted water about 1 minute,
or until done to taste. Drain well and toss the noodles with the
remaining sesame oil. Presentation: Divide the noodles among bowls,
pour the gravy over them and garnish with bean sprouts and cucumber.
