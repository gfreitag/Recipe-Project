Title: DUCK WITH HONEY & CURRY
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Duck, about 2-3 lbs
1    Yellow onion, peeled
2    Whole cloves
4 tb Honey
1 tb Or more curry
Salt and pepper to taste
Rinse and dry the duck. Rub salt and pepper in cavity. Put the two
cloves in the onion and place in the cavity. Mix the honey and curry
powder. Roast the duck at 325F for 1 hour, then begin to baste the
duck every few minutes with the honey/curry mixture for an additional
hour, or until completely done.

This also works well with roasting chickens.
