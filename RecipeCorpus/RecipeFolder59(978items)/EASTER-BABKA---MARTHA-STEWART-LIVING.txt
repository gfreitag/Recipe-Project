Title: EASTER BABKA - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Msl, Easter, Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 3 Cakes
2 c  Milk
1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter
2 pk (2 T) dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
4 lg Eggs
4 lg Egg yolks
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
Zest of 2 oranges
Zest of 1 lemon
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Orange-flavored liqueur
9 c  Sifted unbleached flour
1 c  Slivered almonds, chopped
1 c  Muscat raisins
1 c  Golden raisins
3 tb Confectioners' sugar (opt.)
1 1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar mixed
-WITH
1/4 c  Lemon juice AND
1 ts Water, for glaze
In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, scald milk. Add butter and
stir until melted. Remove pan from heat and let mixture cool to
lukewarm.  In a small bowl, stir yeast into warm water; let sit for 5
to 10 minutes, or until foamy.  In a large bowl, beat eggs, yolks,
and sugar until thick. Add salt, zests, vanilla, and liqueur. Stir to
combine. Stir in milk mixture, then yeast.  Add flour, a cupful at a
time, until dough is moist but not sticky, mixing with a wooden spoon
or your hands. Stir in almonds and raisins.  Knead dough on a floured
board, adding more flour if dough is too sticky, until dough comes
away from your hands, about 6 minutes. Place dough in a very large
buttered bowl.  Cover dough with a damp cloth and let rise until
doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down and let rise again until doubled,
45 minutes to 1 hour.  Heat oven to 350'. Butter three 9-or 10-inch
kugelhopf or angel-food-cake pans. Sprinkle pans with a tablespoon of
confec- tioners' sugar, if desired. Divide dough into 3 portions and
form into balls; arrange in pans and cover loosely. Let dough rise to
tops of pans, about 30 minutes.  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until
cakes are golden brown and tops make a hollow sound when tapped with
knuckles. Cool for 5 minutes in pans; turn out onto racks and cool
for 20 minutes more. Spoon glaze onto babka, allowing it to drip over
sides.
