Title: EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA ALLA NAPOLETANA
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Portions
40 oz Tomato puree
1 tb Tomato paste
1 tb Parsley, chopped
1/2 ts Sweet Basil, ground
1/2 ts Oregano, ground
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 lg Eggplant
Salt as needed
1 c  Flour
3    Eggs, beaten
2 c  Bread crumbs
3/4 c  Olive Oil
8 oz Mozzarella Cheese, shredded
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
Combine first eight ingredients and heat over medium heat for about 20
minutes.  Be careful, not to scorch. Reserve.

Place 1/2" sliced eggplant on rack; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let
stand for about 20 minutes so bitter juice can run off. Rinse each
slice and pat dry. Coat each slice with flour; dip in egg; then coat
lightly with bread crumbs.

Heat oil in heavy skillet (oil should be 1/2" deep). When oil is hot,
add eggplant slices.  Heat 2 minutes on each side or until soft and
golden. Reserve slices on paper toweling to absorb excess oil. Place
about 1/2" reserved tomato sauce over bottom of baking dish sprayed
with cooking spray.  Place eggplant in layers in dish; sprinkle each
layer with cheeses, alternate layers until all ingredients are used,
reserving a little of each cheese for top. Cover lightly with
remaining sauce and reserved cheeses. Bake at 325F. for 30 minutes.
