Title: EGG SALAD SURPRISE
Categories: Salads, Seafood
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Cooked lobster meat; diced,
1    Hard-boiled egg; diced
1 sm Avocado; (ripe) diced
2    Shallots
2    Lemons
1 c  Mayonnaise; (homemade)
1    Red leaf lettuce; (romaine)
1    Red ripe tomatoes
6    Asparagus spears; peeled & c
Salt and pepper; to taste
1. Mix the diced lobster meat, diced eggs and diced avocado
(sprinkled with fresh lemon juice) and fine diced shallots with
the mayonnaise, very gently. Use just enough mayonnaise to coat
and bind. Season to taste with salt and red pepper. I like to
use
the Japanese Sashimi Togarashi.

2. Spoon back into the lobster or avocado shell, and rest on a
bed of
shredded red romaine or curly lettuce. Garnish with lemon
wedges
and asparagus with reserved lobster claws on top.

Serves 1 or 2

April Fool! This is a thinly disguised Lobster Mayonnaise, with an
egg
and avocado salad, accompanied by a dish of Springtime asparagus.
Have
a sauceboat of the freshly made mayonnaise available. Serve with a
crusty bread and a chilled Chablis for a Spring Luncheon. The
Chablis
is one reason I use mayonnaise instead of vinegar. In spooning the
salad into the lobsters chest cavity, spoon it right on top of the
tomalley (the green liver of the lobster). For those who like it,
this
makes a fine taste. For those who don't, suit yourself, chacon a
son
gout!
