Authentic?  I sure as heck can't say.  Fattening++you bet! Good?
More'n likely.  How could it help but be with a brandy cream sauce
and crabmeat.

Melt the butter in a saute pan or skillet over low heat. Add the crab
meat and cook slowly, stirring very gently, just until hot, about 5
to 8 minutes.

To prepare the brandy cream sauce, melt the butter over low heat in a
sauce pan.  Stir in the flour gradually, cook for about 3 minutes,
then gradually pour in the milk, continue stirring.  Cook over low
beat until the sauce thickens, then add the salt, pepper and brandy.
Continue to cook about 5 minutes or until the sauce is medium thick.

To poach the eggs, bring the water and the vinegar to a boil in a
large skillet or saute pan.  Keeping the water at a continuous low
rolling boil, crack the eggs one by one into it. Cook until the egg
whites are firm, about 4 minutes.  Lift the poached eggs out of the
water with a skimmer or slotted spoon, allowing the water to drain
back into the pan. Place them on a heated platter while you assemble
the dishes.

Place 3 ounces of crab meat on each of 8 heated plates, then place 2
poached eggs side by side on the crab meat. Ladle sauce evenly over
the portions.

Makes 8 servings.
