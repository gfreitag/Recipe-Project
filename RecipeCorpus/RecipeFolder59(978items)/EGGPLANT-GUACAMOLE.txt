Title: EGGPLANT GUACAMOLE
Categories: Digest, July
Yield: 1 Servings
Eggplant
Minced onion
Peeled and diced tomatoes
Minced garlic
Cumin
Cilantro
Chili powder
Salt
Take the eggplant, prick it several times with a fork (this is very
important!), place in a shallow baking pan and bake at 350 F. for an
hour or so till it is cook through. Remove from oven and allow to
cool. Peel and mash.  Add the remainder of the ingredients.

Refrigerate mix for an hour or two before eating because it allows the
flavors to blend and smooth out better. After the dip sits for a
while some of the water from the tomatoes separates out and I just
pour that off. One advantage eggplant has over avacados (aside from
the FF aspect) is that eggplant keeps longer. Eggplant guacamole can
be made ahead of time and it will keep for a couple of days in the
refrigerator.
