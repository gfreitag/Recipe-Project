This is a good way to introduce eggs to your baby (if the
pediatrician says you are ready to).  Eggs contain all 22 of the
amino acids-the building blocks of protein-that we need for new
tissues, clotting of blood, and formation of antibodies.

Cold water Mother's milk or formula

Place egg in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil
and simmer very gently for 15 minutes. Remove and immediately fill
pan with running cold water. Let sit in cold water until shell is
cool. Crack open, discard the white and mash the yellow yolk with a
fork and add a few drops breast milk or formula. Go easy (small
amounts of egg for baby) at first to see if any allergies develop.
