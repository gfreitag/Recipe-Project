Title: EL CHARRO CHILE CON CARNE (RED CHILE & BEEF
Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Beef roast (eye of round or
Brisket)
1 c  Flour
1 tb Salt -- or to taste
1 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Oil
3 c  Salsa De Chile Colorado
1 tb Garlic puree -- *
1 ts Oregano
* Garlic Puree - peel 8 whole heads of garlic by smashing the cloves
with the side of a wide knife; the peel will slip off easily then.
Put the peeled garlic in a blender with about 2 cups of water, and
puree. Drain, if necessary, and store in a tightly closed glass jar
in the refrigerator.

This is the basic meat preparation that we serve in bowls along with
tortillas, on combination plates or as filling for Burros, Chimis,
Chalupas, Enchiladas and Tamales.

Cut meat into 1-inch pieces and place, a handful at a time, into a
paper bag containing flour, salt and pepper. Shake well. Repeat with
remaining beef.

In a large skillet, heat oil. Add beef, a batch at a time so that the
skillet is not crowded, and brown slowly. Add Salsa De Chile Colorado,
garlic and oregano. Cook over low heat 1 hour or longer, until meat is
tender, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Add a little hot
water if necessary.
