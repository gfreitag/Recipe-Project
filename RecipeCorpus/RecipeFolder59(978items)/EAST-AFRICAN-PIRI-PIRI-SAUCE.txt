Categories: Appetizers, Sauces, Dips
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Unsalted butter
3    Small red chiles
6    Cloves garlic

You like hot? You can increase the heat to "paint-remover" by using
hotter chiles or adding to spice quantities. Pound chiles and garlic
in a mortar (or process). Add to melted butter (in Africa, usually
clarified butler) with paprika and chile powder. Add lime or lemon
juice to taste (lime will be better for this one). Mix well. For
chicken wings, or breasts, or fish, or prawns, marinate meat for 5-10
minutes, baste with sauce while cooking and spoon sauce over before
serving.
