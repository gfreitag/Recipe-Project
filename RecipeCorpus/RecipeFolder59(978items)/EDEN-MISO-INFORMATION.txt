Title: EDEN MISO INFORMATION
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 Info  The variety of color, flavor and texture you'll find in EDEN Misos is
a reflection of the ingredients and climate in which they were made.
Whole beans and grains are cleaned, steamed, inoculated with koji
(Aspergillus oryzae), which is also used in the production of shoyu,
tamari and rice vinegar) and mixed with sea salt, then aged in wooden
kegs weighted with stones to allow time, temperature and climate to
create a uniquelY satisfying food.

Soybean
Hacho Miso
================================================ Hacho Miso is dark
and rich. It is aged a full 3 years. Use it alone when an intense
flavor is desired, or use mixed half-and-half with any other Miso for
soups, dressings or marinade. Mugi Miso Barley
================================================ Mugi Miso is made
with soYbeans and barley koji. It matures in 1-2 years, and has a
milder aroma than Hacho Miso. It is perhaps the most universally
appealing of all the misos, suitable for summer or winter cooking.

Rice
Kome Miso
================================================ Kome Miso is made
with soybeans and rice koji, and is the sweetest of the Misos. There
are many variations, including Shiro (Sweet White) Miso and Genmai
(Brown Rice) 1Miso.

Sweet Rice
Shiro Miso
================================================ Shiro Miso, sometimes
called "white miso", is the "youngest" Miso (made in just 40 days).
Like Kome Miso it has a light, sweet taste, suitable for use in a
wide variety of dishes.

Brown Rice
Genmai Miso
================================================ Genmai Miso is made
with brown rice koji. As contradictory as it may seem, this is a new
and not a traditional food. Prompted by many requests, a method was
developed for making koji from whole brown rice. The result is a
delightfully rich miso with a light flavor. Soba Miso Buckwheat
================================================ Soba Miso, made with
buckwheat and soybeans, is a hearty variety that tastes especially
good in cold weather.
