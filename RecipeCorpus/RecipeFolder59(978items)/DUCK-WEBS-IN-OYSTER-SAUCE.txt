Stephen Ceideburg
5    To 6 duck webs
1/2 lb Broccoli
2    To 3 Chinese dried
-mushrooms, soaked
2 sl Ginger root, peeled
2    Scallions (spring onions)
2 tb Rice wine (or sherry)
1 ts Soy sauce
1/2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1    Star anise
2 tb Oyster sauce
1 ts Sesame seed oil
1 tb Cornstarch (corn flour)
4 tb Oil
Remove the outer skin of the duck webs; wash and clean well. Crush the
ginger root and onions. Heat up 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil; toss in the
crushed ginger root and onions followed by the duck webs; stir a few
times; add rice wine or sherry and soy sauce. After 5 minutes or so,
transfer the entire contents to a sand-pot or casserole. Add sugar, a
little salt, star anise and a little stock or water. Simmer gently
for 3 hours. Just before serving, stir-fry the broccoli or greens
with the Chinese dried mushrooms, a little salt and sugar. Place them
on a serving dish, then arrange the duck webs on top of that.
Meanwhile heat a little oil in a saucepan, add oyster sauce and
sesame seed oil. Thicken with cornstarch (corn flour) mixed with a
little cold water; when it is smooth, pour it over the duck webs and
serve. The oyster sauce enriches the subtle taste of the duck webs
