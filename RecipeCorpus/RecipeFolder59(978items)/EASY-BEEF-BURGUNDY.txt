My old Sunset "Favorite Recipes" cookbook has a "Beef Burgundy" recipe
which I've made for years. Over time, I've adapted the recipe to take
advantage of a few shortcuts without sacrificing the great flavor. The
following is my version:

In a Dutch oven or heavy saucepan cook the onion and bacon until
onion is soft, but not browned. With a slotted spoon, remove onion
and bacon and set aside. Add the round steak to the pan drippings and
cook until browned on all sides. Sprinkle the meat with salt and
pepper, then add the mushrooms, garlic, wine, water, parsley, celery,
thyme, and bay leaf. Return the onion and bacon to the pan and stir
well, then cover and cook over low heat for 1-1/2 hours, or until
meat is tender. Keep an eye on the liquid in the pan and add water
and reduce heat if it seems to be boiling away quickly. When tender,
with a slotted spoon, remove meat mixture from the liquid to a
serving bowl. Discard the bay leaf. In a cup, mix some of the hot
liquid with the flour, then stir into the liquid remaining in the
pan. Cook stirring constantly until thickened (should only take about
1 minute). Pour the thickened liquid over the meat mixture in the
serving bowl, stir to mix, and serve immediately over rice.
