Categories: Frostings, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/3 c  Sifted icing sugar

1/2 ts Vanilla
Place all ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Beat at low speed until
ingredients are combined. Then, beat at high speed until stiff glossy
peaks form when beaters are lifted, about 5 to 7 minutes. Icing is
best used right away, but can be covered with plastic wrap or a damp
cloth and kept at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.
