Title: EASY BUT GOOD BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings  Mix 2C flour with 1 t salt  (I use 1/2 whole wheat flour and adjust
water)

Scald 1/2 C milk.  Add in 1 1/2 C boiling water and let cool to
lukewarm.

Dissolve 1 package yeast in 1/4 C lukewarm water.

Add the dissolved yeast to the milk/water and add to the dry
ingredients, along with 1 T sugar and 1 1/2 T oil.

Mix well but don't knead.

Cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk.

Punch down.  Form into two sort of flat shapes.  Roll each (sort of
jellyroll like) into two loaves. They'll be a little longer and
thinner than average bread. Cover and let rise again until almost
doubled in bulk, or until a finger indentation doesn't disappear
after a few minutes.

Place on oiled cookie sheet.  Place a pie pan with 1/2 " of boiling
water on the bottom of the oven.

Bake 15 minutes at 400 and 30 minutes at 350.

You know it's done when it sounds hollow when tapped on crust.
