Title: EFFORTLESS GRAVY WITH CRANBERRY SAUCE
Categories: Butterball, Gravy
Yield: 2 Cups  The addition of store-bought whole-berry cranberry sauce to a basic
recipe for turkey gravy ensures that first-time gravy makers will end
up with a sauce that has both depth of flavor and color.

3-1/2 tablespoons pan drippings from a roasted Butterball turkey
3-1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1-1/4 cups broth made from the turkey giblets or canned chicken
broth
1/4 cup cream sherry or cranberry juice
1/2 cup whole berry cranberry sauce
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

1. Put the turkey drippings into a small saucepan and heat over medium
heat. Add the flour, stirring continually with a whisk or wooden
spoon; cook for 1 minute, taking care not to let the flour mixture
brown. Slowly whisk in the giblet or chicken broth to make a smooth
mixture. Whisk in the sherry or cranberry juice and continue to stir
constantly until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.

2. Reduce heat to low and stir in the cranberry sauce until
incorporated. Season the gravy to taste with salt and pepper. Keep
warm over very low heat until ready to serve.
