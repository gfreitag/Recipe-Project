Title: EGGPLANT PARMESAN (PINES OF ROME)
Categories: Italian, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Eggplants, unpeeled, sliced
-1/2-inch thick
4    Eggs, beaten
3/4    To 1 cup flour
Soybean oil for frying
1 lb Mozzarella cheese, thinly
-sliced
FOR THE SAUCE
4    Cloves garlic, minced
2 tb Olive oil
28 oz Whole tomatoes (1 can)
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
1    Bay leaf
FOR THE EGGPLANT

Grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)

Dip the eggplant slices in the egg, then in the flour. Pour enough
soybean oil into a large frying pan to come an inch up the side. Fry
the eggplant slices for about 3 minutes on each side. Drain.

In an 8-by-12-inch oven-proof glass pan, place a layer of fried
eggplant, then a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering two more
times so that there are three layers of eggplant and three of
mozzarella. Bake for about 5 minutes in a 500-degree oven.

To make the sauce, saute the garlic in the olive oil. When it starts
to turn golden, add the tomatoes with their juice. Break each tomato
in half with a knife. Bring to a boil. Add the parsley, a pinch of
salt, pepper to taste, and the bay leaf.  Let boil for another 2
minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to stand for 5 minutes.

Slice the baked eggplant into squares.  Place on plates and top with
ladles of the sauce.  Top with grated Parmesan, if desired.

Makes 8 servings.
