Title: EGGPLANT DIP 2
Categories: Appetizers, Spreads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Eggplant
1/4    Onion, minced
3    Cloves fresh garlic, minced
Olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Cook eggplant in heavy skillet over low flame, turning frequently
until skin is dark and crackles to the touch. Cool, peel and mash
pulp; add onion and garlic. Add oil, a little at a time, while
continuing to mash pulp, until mixture is creamy in texture. Eggplant
absorbs the oil, so quite a bit is needed. Add salt and pepper to
taste. Refrigerate. May be used as a dip for vegetables or on chunks
of pita bread as a spread.
