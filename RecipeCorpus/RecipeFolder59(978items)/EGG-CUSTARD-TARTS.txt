Title: EGG CUSTARD TARTS
Categories: Chinese, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
Tart Pastry:
1/4 c  Butter
1/4 c  Lard
1    Egg
6 tb Sugar
2 c  Sifted all purpose flour.
Egg Custard Filling:
2    Whole extra large eggs
3    Extra large egg yolks
1 c  Whole milk
1/2 c  Half and half
1 c  Sugar
Cream the butter with lard. Add egg and sugar. Beat well. Add flour,
1 cup at a time. The dough will be mealy. Work quickly with your
hands to gather dough into a ball. Knead lightly so the mixture
adheres. You may chill it at this point while making the filling.

Egg Custard Filling: Be sure all the ingredients are at room
temperature. Beat whole eggs at low speed with egg yolks well. Do not
over beat, add sugar, then milk, then half and half. Let mixture rest
10 - 15 minutes. Skim foam from mixture.

Separate dough into 24 ball. Press each into 2 1/2 inch tart shell to
an even layer across the bottom and all the way up the side. Fill
shell with filling almost to the top. Preheat oven to 300. Place
tarts on cooky sheet and bake for 45 minutes. Cool for 10 - 15
minutes. Loosen slightly by inserting a toothpick along the sides.
Tart shell should unmold easily.

Rhoda Yee's comments: It is important that the ingredients for the
filling be at room temperature and beaten over a bowl of warm water.
Cold ingredients will cause filling to separate during baking. By
skimming off the foam, the custard will have a golden, creamy
appearance with a velvety smooth texture which is a most unique and
delightful gastronomic treat! Do not bake at high heat, this will
cause the custard to bubble up like a balloon and burst.
