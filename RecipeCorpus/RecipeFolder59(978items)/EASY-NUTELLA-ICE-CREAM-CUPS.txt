cream in the bottom of each ramekin. Drizzle 2 tsp nutella evenly
over the chocolate ice cream. Spread 1/2 cup coffee ice cream in each

freezer at a time, spread a smooth layer of nutella over the coffee
ice cream. Place a hazelnut in the center of each filled ramekin.
Freeze the ramekins just until the topping is firm, about 15 minutes.

press heavy aluminum foil around each ramekin. Label with date and
contents. Freeze up to 2 weeks.

TO SERVE: Unwrap the ramekins and let sit at room temperature 5 to 10
minutes to soften the ice cream slightly.
