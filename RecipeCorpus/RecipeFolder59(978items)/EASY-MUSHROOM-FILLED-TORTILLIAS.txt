Title: EASY MUSHROOM FILLED TORTILLIAS
Categories: Mexico
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Fresh mushrooms
5 tb Olive oil
Salt
Pepper
Oregano
Marjoram
Garlic
1/2    Bell pepper, sliced
- into bite-sized strips
1/2 sm Onion, thinly sliced
-and separated into rings
1 c  Prepared salsa
2    Flour tortillias
Shreded cheddar cheese
Heat tortillias in oven along with serving plate at low temp, as per
package directions (ie: in foil so they don't dry out). (If you plan
to do this in the microwave, wait.)

Saute mushrooms, bell pepper, onions, garlic, with seasonings in oil.
I prefer somewhat crunchy bell peppers, so i begin sauteing
everything before cutting up the pepper. This seems to get the timing
right. When the vegetables have reached

the desired level of doneness -- I like my mushrooms cooked to death
~- pour into the pan the salsa. Cook together for several more
minutes.

Place the cheese and mushroom mixture in the tortilla, roll and serve.

(This is a "what is edible in my refrigerator" recipe that actually
turned out well. So i thought i'd share. I never thought of mushrooms
in "Mexican" food before. 'Course we made shark fajitas a few weeks
ago with soy sauce, so "authentic" doesn't seem to make a dent with
me except for how i fix refried beans.) -- Judith Elaine Bush
