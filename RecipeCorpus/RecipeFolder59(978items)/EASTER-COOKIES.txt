Yield: 54 Servings

Preheat oven to 350 F (175 C).  Grease several baking sheets with
butter. In a large bowl, beat butter with sugar until creamy. Beat in
egg yolks, orange flower water and milk. Add currants. Sift flour and
salt into bowl; mix in to form a fairly stiff dough.  Knead lightly
on a floured surface until smooth.  Roll out to 1/8-inch thickness.
Using a round 2-1/2-inch-fluted cookie cutter, cut out circles from
dough; place on prepared baking sheets.  Knead and roll out
trimmings; cut out more circles.  Continue until dough is used up.
Bake cookies 10 minutes. Remove from oven.  Brush cookies with beaten
egg white; sprinkle lightly with superfine sugar.  Return to oven for
about 5 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Remove from baking
sheets to wire racks; cool. Store in an airtight container.  Source:
