Title: EASY PARKER HOUSE ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 c  Milk; scalded
2 ts Butter or regular margarine
2 pk Active dry yeast; or
1/4 c  Lukewarm water; 110 deg. f.
2 ts Butter or margarine; melted
3 ts Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
2 ts Active dry yeast; bulk
4 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
Pour the scalded milk over the sugar, 2 tbls of butter and salt in a
mixing bowl.  Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm
water and stir to dissolve. Add 2 cups of flour, and the yeast
mixture to the milk mixture.  Beat, with an electric mixer on medium
speed, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add enough of the
remaining flour to make a soft dough, then cover and let rest for 15
minutes. Knead the dough a few times on a lightly floured surface
until it is no longer sticky and roll out to a 1/2-inch thickness.
Cut into rounds, using a floured biscuit cutter. Brush the rounds
with the remaining 2 Tbls of melted butter and crease each roll in
the center with the dull edge of a knife. Fold the rolls over on the
crease and press the edges together lightly. Place on greased baking
sheets and cover. Let rise in a warm place until almost doubled,
about 30 minutes. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 10
minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from the baking sheets and
cool on wire racks. NOTE: These rolls are almost a must at the
Holiday dinners coming up shortly. Restaurants and most older cooks
make it a tradition to serve them.
