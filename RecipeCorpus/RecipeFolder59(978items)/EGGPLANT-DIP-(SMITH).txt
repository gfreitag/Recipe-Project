Title: EGGPLANT DIP (SMITH)
Categories: Sauces, Low-fat
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lg Eggplant
2    Garlic cloves
1    Green onion; chopped
1/4 c  Parsley
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Dill weed
Recipe by: McDougall Plan Cut the stem off the eggplant and prick it
all over with a fork. Place directly on the oven rack in a 350 degree
oven. Bake about 1 hour or until eggplant is soft and has wrinkled
skin. Remove from oven and cool. When it is cool enough to handle,
peel and chop. Place in blender with remaining ingredients and blend
until smooth. Chill before serving.

HELPFUL HINTS: Use as a dip for raw vegetables, such as broccoli,
cauliflower, carrots, zucchini. Or use as a dip for whole wheat pita
bread. If you add more water when blending, this makes an interesting
salad dressing, Also good as a sandwich spread. From the collection
