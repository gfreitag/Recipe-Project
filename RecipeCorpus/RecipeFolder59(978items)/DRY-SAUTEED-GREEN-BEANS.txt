Title: DRY SAUTEED GREEN BEANS
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Side dish, Beans, Chinese
Yield: 4 Servings
5 ts Peanut oil or canola oil
1 cl Garlic, peeled & minced
1 ts Minced gingerroot
1 lb Green beans (2" pieces)
1 ts Oriental sesame oil
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
1. Heat the oil in a wok or skillet.  Add the garlic and ginger, and
stir-fry the ingredients for 30 seconds. 2. Add the green beans, and
stir-fry them over high heat for 2 to 4 minutes. 3. Add the sesame
oil and salt (if desired), toss the ingredients to coat them, and
serve the beans. Preparation tip: The beans are supposed to be
tender-crisp and shriveled or even charred a bit on the outside. If
you like tenderer beans, cover the pan after adding the sesame oil
and salt, and continue cooking the beans for a few minutes over
moderately low heat.
