Title: DUCKLINGS SWIMMING IN A POND
Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
6 c  Rich chicken broth
1/2 c  Shelled green peas (or
-quartered snowpeas)
12    Shelled baby shrimp
4    Nami black mushrooms
3    Egg whites
Yellow food coloring
Even mature adults - gourmets no less - "oo" and "ah" when presented
with this simple-to-prepare soup.

Preparation:  Wash & soak mushrooms in warm water for 1 hour; slice
into thin strips; reserve.  Blanch shrimp in salted boiling water
(omit if shrimp are precooked).

Make ducklings within hour or less of serving.  Have steamer ready.

Work with eggs & mixing bowl at room temperature. Separate whites &
yolks; reserve yolks for another recipe. Beat egg whites, starting
slowly, then progressively faster after eggs begin to foam, until
eggs are stiff but not runny. If whites are too stiff, they tend to
break apart in shaping process.

Form 2 ducklings per serving.  Use tablespoon to form body; flatten
egg in spoon; turn over onto steaming plate. To body, add blob of egg
for neck & head, another piece for tail. Use toothpick to carefully
shape head & tail.

Steam one as test. Steaming should take 30-60 seconds to set surface
of egg. After steaming, swab beak & tail with yellow food coloring;
put color on toothpick to mark eyes.

Soup:  30 minutes or so before serving, heat broth to just under
boil; add mushrooms & peas.  5 minutes before serving, add shrimp &
desired seasonings.  Pour soup into warm serving bowl. Float
ducklings on soup. Serve.
