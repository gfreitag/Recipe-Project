Categories: Vegetables, Side dishes
Yield: 4 Servings
3 md Sized eggplant (batinjaan)
6 tb Flour
4 tb Butter
1 tb Lemon juice
Grated cheese
Salt and pepper
In Turkey this unusual eggplant dish is called Sultan's Pleasure, for
reasons which are obvious as soon as one samples it. Particularly
delicious with chicken. Grilling the eggplants gives the vegetables
an agreeable smoky flavor.

Grill eggplants whole without peeling them by holding over a flame and
turning slowly, or prick skin in several places and set in hot oven.
When the skin begins to break and the inside pulp feels soft, slip
off the skin and scoop the pulp into a saucepan. Mix lemon juice with
pulp and simmer until very soft, stirring often (10-15 minutes).
Meanwhile, melt butter, add flour to it and allow flour to brown.
Beat the butter and flour mixture into the eggplant. Slowly add
several tablespoons of hot milk and continue beating until mixture
resembles mashed potatoes. Lastly add several tablespoons of grated
Parmesan or Cheddar cheese and cook several minutes more. Serve
immediately. (From Food from the Arab World Marie Karam Khayat and
