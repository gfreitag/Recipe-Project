Title: EGGS & CHORIZO
Categories: Eggs, Main dish, Meats, Sausages
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Onion; Chopped, 1 Sm.
2 tb Vegetable Oil
8 oz Chorizo Sausage; Bulk
8    Eggs; Large
1/4 c  Half-and-Half
1/2 ts Oregano Leaves; Dried
Cook and stir the onion in oil in a 10-inch skillet until tender but
not brown.  Add the sausage, cooking and stirring , until the sausage
is done then drain. Mix the eggs, half-and-half and the oregano well
with a fork. Pour into the sausage mixture in the skillet. Cook over
medium heat. As the mixture begins to set at the bottom and sides,
gently lift the cooked portion with a fork or spatula so that the
uncooked egg mixture can run under the cooked portion.  Avoid
constant stirring as this will make the eggs tough and hard. Cook
until all the eggs are cooked but still moist, about 3 to 5 minutes.
