Title: EASY PINTO BEAN SOUP
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Bag pinto beans
2 pk Onion soup mix
I put a bag of pinto beans in my crock pot with water and let them
cook several hours until softened and then wondered how was I going
to season them.  After browsing my pantry for several moments I
decided to throw in 2 packages of onion soup mix.

Suffice it to say, they turned out wonderfully, (I've added nothing
else) and my 6 year old, who hates beans of any kind, had two bowls
last night and another today.

As far as I know, the soup is fat free.  And surprisingly ... no gas!
I don't know if the onions have anything to do with this, but thought
I'd throw that in. ;-)
