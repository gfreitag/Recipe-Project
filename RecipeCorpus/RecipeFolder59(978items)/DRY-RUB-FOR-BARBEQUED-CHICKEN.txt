Title: DRY RUB FOR BARBEQUED CHICKEN
Categories: Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Paprika
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/8 c  Salt
1/8 c  Garlic powder
1/8 c  Dried chipotles peppers
-ground
1 tb Celery salt
1 tb Onion powder
1 tb Pepper, black, fresh ground
1 tb Chimayo red chile, ground
Mix thoroughly.  To me, the thing that makes this outstanding is the
chipotles.  And note that these are not the canned ones in adobo -
they're dried.  This makes their smokiness a bit more intense. You
might have difficulty finding them.  Look for them in the Hispanic
section of larger grocery stores. Same with the Red pepper, use
cayenne instead.
