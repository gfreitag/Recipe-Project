1    5 lb domestic duck
Salt and pepper
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Orange juice
1 c  Good quality red wine
1 tb Lemon juice
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
1 tb Grated lemon or orange rind
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/2 ts Rosemary
pn Oregano
3 tb Orange curacao
Flour; for thickening
Cut duck into serving-size pieces; season with salt and pepper. Brown
in hot olive oil.  Remove to a casserole with tight-fitting lid. In
same skillet, add orange juice, wine, lemon juice, garlic, onion,
rind, and seasonings.  Bring to boiling, scraping up browned bits in
bottom and on sides of pan.  Pour mixture over duck; bake, covered,
in a 300 degree F. oven for 2 to
3    hours or until tender.

Remove duck to heated platter.  Strain and measure remaining pan
juices; taste and correct seasoning. Add orange curacao and enough
red wine to bring liquid to 2 cups. Thicken to desired consistency
with flour stirred smooth in a little wine.  Add to measured liquid;
cook, stirring constantly until thickened. Pour over duck. Serve with
rice. Source: Favorite Recipes of California Winemakers.

Judi's Notes:  This recipe was modified by me by adding garlic,
increasing alcohol to 3 tablespoons, and increasing the oven
temperature to 300 degrees F. to make sure poultry is evenly cooked.
Original recipe called for an oven temperature of 275 degrees, and I
felt it needed to be increased.  This is a very tasty dish, enjoy!
