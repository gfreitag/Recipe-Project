About 2 hours before serving or early in the day.

In bowl, combine yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup flour. In saucepan over
medium heat, heat margarine and 1 cup water until very warm (125
degrees).

With mixer at low speed, beat liquid into dry ingredients. At medium
speed, beat 2 minutes. Reserve 1 egg white; beat in egg and egg yolk
with 1 cup flour; beat 2 minutes.  Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour.

Turn dough onto floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic,
about 5 minutes, working in about 1/4 cup flour while kneading. Shape
dough into ball; cover and let rest 15 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 2 cookie sheets. Cut dough into
eighths.  For 1 bunny; cut 1 piece dough in half; shape half into
ball, with a kiss in center, for body. Place on cookie sheet. Cut
other half in half; shape half into ball; brush with egg white; place
next to large ball, tucking slightly under it for head. From
remaining half, pinch off 3/4-indh piece for tail and shape 2 ears.
Brush tail and ears with egg white; tuck slightly under bunny. Brush
body with egg white. Make 3 more bunnies. Bake 15 minutes or until
browned.  Cool on rack.  Repeat to make 4 more.

Mix confectioners' sugar with about 1/4 teaspoon water and a hint of
red food coloring (for pink); use to draw face on bunnies. If you
like, tie bows around bunnies' necks.
