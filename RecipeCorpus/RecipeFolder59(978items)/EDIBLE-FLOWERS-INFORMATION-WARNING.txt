Title: EDIBLE FLOWERS INFORMATION WARNING
Categories: Info
Yield: 1 Info
None
Not all flowers are edible. Some delicious looking plants are
poisonous, and eating them could lead to serious illness or death.
For instance, there are 60 commercial varieties of pansies, and only
three that are specifically for eating. Choose flowers only from
edible plants or those listed in a reliable source. Flowers also
should be eaten only in the amounts specified in recipes.

Persons who are prone to allergies can have an allergic reaction to
flowers, as to any food. Proceed with caution when trying unfamiliar
flowers. If you have any doubt about the identity of a flower, do not
eat it. Your best bet is to use flowers commercially grown especially
for eating.  Linda Beaulieu.
