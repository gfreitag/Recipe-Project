Title: EGG TACOS
Categories: Pickell
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Taco shells
8    Eggs
1/2 c  Milk
Salt & Pepper to taste
2 c  Shredded lettuce
2    Tomatoes, diced
1 c  Shredded Monterey Jack or
Cheddar cheese.
Salsa & sour cream (opt)
Heat taco shells as directed on package.

Beat together eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Heat a nonstick medium
skillet over medium-high heat until hot enough to sizzle a drop of
water. Pour in egg mixture and innediately reduce heat to medium-low.
As mixture begins to set, gently move spatula across bottom and sides
of skillet to form large, soft curds. Cook until eggs are thickened
and no visible liquid remains, but they are still moist, about 1
minute.

Divide egg mixture among taco shells. Garnish as desired with lettuce,
tomato, cheese, salsa and sour cream.
