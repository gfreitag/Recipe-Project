Spread an 8 ounce package of cream cheese on the bottom of a 9 inch
glass pie plate. Pour a small (14 oz.) jar of mild salsa over the
cream cheese; then sprinkle 8 oz. of grated old cheddar cheese over
salsa. Finish with a layer of chopped green peppers and green onions.
Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes or until cheddar melts.
Serve with large tortilla chips for scooping. (Keep napkins handy for
drips.)
