Title: DUCK WITH CHESTNUTS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings

1 lg Duck
1/2 kg Chestnuts
2 lg Oranges
This dish, Spanish in origin, is rich in flavour and well worth the
effort.

Well beforehand, disjoint a large duck by cutting it into 2 breast
pieces and 4 leg and thigh pieces. Use the back, neck and wings to
make a good strong stock. Remove the excess fat and render for use
another day. Parboil and peel 1/2 kg chestnuts.

Heat a large, dry frying pan to very hot and saute the duck pieces
until golden on all sides. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat
which will have accumulated in the pan and gently fry a finely
chopped large onion. When it is golden, add the zest and juice of 2
large oranges and stir to deglaze the pan.

Put the duck legs into a large saucepan, pour the orange- onion
mixture over them and add enough duck stock to cover and several
sprigs of thyme. Simmer for 30 minutes. Then add the duck breasts and
chestnuts and, if necessary, more stock to cover and cook for 20
minutes longer or until fork-tender.

Remove the duck and chestnuts to a serving dish and keep warm while
boiling the sauce hard to reduce until syrupy. Add a tablespoon of
red currant jelly, adjust the seasoning and pour the sauce over the
duck and chestnuts. Serve.
