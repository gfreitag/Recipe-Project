Title: EGGLESS MAYO ("BETTER 'N HELLMAN'S")
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Edensoy (Original)
2 2/3 c  Oil
2 tb Cider Vinegar
1 tb Maple Syrup (or sugar)
1 ts Salt
MMMMM------------------------NOW TRY THIS-----------------------------
Directions: Place soy milk in food processor (or blender). Put on
lowest setting.  Drizzle oil into soy milk. Add other ingredients. I
add about the same amount of lemon juice in addition to the vinegar.
Someatimes I add one tablespoon of dry mustard. You've got to try
adding basil and/or sage and/or oregeno.

I've also never had a problem adding all the vinegar, syrup, salt,
etc. to the soy milk first and then adding the oil.

You cannot fail.  Try it.

I got the basic recipe from Shirley Wilkes-Johnson. She is a gourmet
cook and inventor.
