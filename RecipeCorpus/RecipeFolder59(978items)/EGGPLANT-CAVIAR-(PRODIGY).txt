Title: EGGPLANT CAVIAR (PRODIGY)
Categories: Appetizers, Spreads, Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Eggplants
3    Garlic cloves; minced
1/3 c  Olive oil
1 tb Minced parsley
-(or Onion, Basil or
- Anchovies)
1    Lemon, juice only
Salt and pepper
This makes a dip that is delicious on raw vegetables or spread on
French bread, and is good as an appetizer, snack or light lunch.

HALVE THE EGGPLANTS LENGTHWISE and place under a broiler, 2 inches
from the flame. Broil for 50 minutes, turning once, until very soft.
Scoop out the flesh and discard the seed strips. Pass through the
coarse blade of a food mill or coarsely mash by hand. Add garlic to
taste (be careful, the taste becomes stronger with time). Beat in the
olive oil. Add the parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper.
