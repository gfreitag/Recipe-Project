Title: EASY BAKED TEMPEH
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Tempeh
16 oz Tomato sauce, Mcdougall
1/4 c  Onion; chopped fine
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
1/4 c  Soy sauce, low sodium
1/2 ts Curry powder
1/4 ts Ground ginger
Preparation Time: 0:50 Tempeh is a compact patty made by fermenting
cooked hulled soybeans with a beneficial mold that binds the beans
together. Other legumes, such as peas and lentils, and also grains,
such as rice, wheat, and barley -- alone or in various combinations
~- are sometimes added. Because it has a dense, solid consistency, it
is often used to replace meat in various dishes and on sandwiches.
Like tofu, it is high in fat and protein. You will find tempeh in the
refrigerated or frozen food sections of your natural food store.
Refrigerated, it lasts a week, and frozen, it lasts indefinately.
Freezing does not change its texture appreciably.

Cut the tempeh into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Preheat the oven
to 350 degrees. Combine the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan
and simmer over low heat until the sauce thickens slightly, about 10
minutes. Spoon a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 2 - quart
baking dish. Add the tempeh pieces and cover with the remaining
sauce. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes.
