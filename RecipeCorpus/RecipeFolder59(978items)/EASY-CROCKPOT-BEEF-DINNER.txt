Add the onion, garlic, carrots, celery to the crockpot. Place meat on
top of vegetables.  Add the Worcestershire sauce, Kitchen Bouquet,
dry soup mix. Last, pour the stewed tomatoes over the top. I cooked
this on Low heat for 7 hrs then added the mushrooms and let it cook
for an hour or so more. When done, remove the meat and if a thicker
gravy is desired, stir in 2 T flour and set crockpot to high while
stirring for a minute or so. Serve with rice or noodles. (Or can add
