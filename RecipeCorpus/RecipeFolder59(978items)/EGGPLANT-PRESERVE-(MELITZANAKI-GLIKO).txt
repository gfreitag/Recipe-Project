2 lb Eggplant

Wash the eggplants and trim.  Cut in walnut-sized pieces. Cover with
water and the juice of 1 lemon and leave to soak for an hour. Boil
until the pieces are just tender (about 10 minutes), remove and
drain. Push an almond inside each of the eggplant pieces.

In a preserving pan, heat sugar and water and add the eggplant. Heat
gently for 10 minutes.  Leave in the syrup overnight. Next day, heat
the syrup and add the rest of the ingredients, including the juice of
the second lemon. Simmer gently until setting point is reached. Test
in the usual way and put in hot jars. Seal and allow to cool. Store
in a cool place.

Santa Maria writes:  "This preserve, which is particularly liked in
Crete, is made with tiny eggplants. If you cannot obtain them, here
is a recipe which uses eggplant cut in pieces.  Otherwise, use the
same weight of tiny eggplants."
