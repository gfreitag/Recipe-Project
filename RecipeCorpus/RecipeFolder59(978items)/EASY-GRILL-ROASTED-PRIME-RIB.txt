Title: EASY GRILL ROASTED PRIME RIB
Categories: Beef, Grilled
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea 12 to 15 pound capless prime
Rib (aka export rib) bone in
1 c  Kosher salt
1 c  Coarse cracked black pepper
Rub the prime rib all over with salt and pepper.

In a large kettle grill, start a fire well over to one side. When the
coals are well lit, place the rib on the grill grid on the side
opposite the coals, being careful that no part of the rib is directly
over the coals. Put the lid on the kettle with the vents 1/4 open.
Cook for approximately 2 hours, adding a handful of fresh charcoal
every 30 minutes or so.

At the 2-hour point, check the rib with a meat thermometer to
determine doneness; remove from the fire at 118 F for very rare, 122
F for rare, 126 for medium rare, and so on, adding 4 F for each
degree of doneness. Allow to rest for 30 minutes before slicing.
