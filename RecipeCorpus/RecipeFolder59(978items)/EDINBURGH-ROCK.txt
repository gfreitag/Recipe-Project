nearly boiling, add a good pinch of cream of tartar and boil without
stirring until it reaches 258 F. in cold weather or 260 F. in
hot++that is, until it forms a hard lump in cold water. Remove from
the fire, add colouring and flavouring, and pour on a buttered marble
slab, preferably through buttered candy bars.  As it begins to cool,
turn the ends and edges inwards with a buttered knife.  When cool
enough to handle, dust it with powdered sugar, take it up and pull
gently (being careful not to twist it) until it is dull.  Cut in
pieces with a pair of scissors. Place the rock in a warm room and let
it remain there for at least 24 hours, until the process of
granulation is complete, and the rock is powdery and soft. "The
original Edinburgh Rock is made by the famous Edinburgh firm of
Ferguson. Confectionery is an important industry in the capital, and
the world-famous rock is one of the triumphs of the Scottish
confectioner's art.
