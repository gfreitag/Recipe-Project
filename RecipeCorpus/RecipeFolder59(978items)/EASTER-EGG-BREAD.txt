Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Flour, unsifted
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 pk Active Dry Yeast
2/3 c  Milk
2 tb Margarine
2    Eggs, room temperature

In a large bowl, mix 1 cup flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Combine milk
and 2 tablespoons margarine in a sauce pan and heat over low heat
until warm. (Margarine does not need to be melted). Gradually add to
the dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes on medium speed, scraping side
occasionally. Add the eggs and / cup of flour, beat on high speed for
2 minutes. Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough. Put on a
floured board and kneak until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased
bowl and turn one to coat. Cover and let rise for 1 hours. Combine
fruit, nuts and seeds. Punch down dough and knead in fruit mixture.
Divide in half and roll each into a 24" long rope and braid loosely
to form a ring on a greased cookie sheet. Put the raw eggs in the
spaces, cover and let rise until double about 1 hour. Bake 30-35
minutes in a preheated 350oF oven. Cool on rack, frost with powdered
sugar and sprinkles.
