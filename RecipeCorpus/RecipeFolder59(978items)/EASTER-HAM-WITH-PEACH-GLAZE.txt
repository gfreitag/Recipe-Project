temperature. Cover and refrigerate for 2 days. Bring glaze to room
temperature and discard spice bag before using.  Serves 10.

surface of ham. Score 1/4-inch-deep diamond pattern in upper surface.
Place ham in shallow baking pan just large enough to accommodate.

degrees. Set ham in oven. Add broth to pan.  Bake ham 2 hours,
basting every 15 minutes. Spoon off pan drippings. Spread glaze over
top of ham. Bake until glaze is light brown, about 45 minutes. Let
rest 20 minutes before serving. Serves 10.
