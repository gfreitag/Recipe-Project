"This is fun to make and everyone who came to my house had a second
serving and might have had more but unfortunately by that time it was
all gone. This recipe came from a cookbook published in 1917 during
World War 1 when cooks had to skimp." Anne's note: this is also
called "War Cake" or "Victory Cake" in some cookbooks. It might be
suitable for vegans (is shortening derived from animals?)

Into a saucepan, measure sugar, water, shortening and raisins. Boil
for 4 minutes. Cool. Sift together and add remaining ingredeints.
Bake at 350F for 40 minutes.
