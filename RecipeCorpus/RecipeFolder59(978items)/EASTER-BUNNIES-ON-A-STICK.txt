Title: EASTER BUNNIES ON A STICK
Categories: Holidays, Candies, Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Chocolate coating
1 lb White coating Or any color
1    Taffy molds
1    Sticks
1    Taffy covers
You can also buy your molds and sticks, and sleeves of plastic to put
over the taffy at a candy supply store. Melt the coatings. I use a
electric fry pan with water on low and use small stainless steel or
glass bowls to melt different color coatings and of course the
chocolate. Just fill the molds, put in stick and roll it to coat it
and set it in the coating. I place in the frezzer for a minute or two
to make them nice and shiny.
