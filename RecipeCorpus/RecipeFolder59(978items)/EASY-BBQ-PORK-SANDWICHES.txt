Title: EASY BBQ PORK SANDWICHES
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lb Boneless pork roast
4    Cloves garlic, minced
1 md Onion, minced
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Bottle of your favorite bbq
-sauce
Place the roast, garlic, and onion in a crock pot on high. Add the
salt and pepper and a little bit of water. Cook on high until you can
easily shred the pork roast with a fork. I would cook this in my
crock pot (Rival) for about 5 hours. Remove the roast and shred the
meat removing as much of the fat as possible and the bone. Strain the
grease in the crock pot, keeping any bits of garlic and onion left
and throwing out the grease. Place the shredded meat back into the
crock pot, along with the bits of garlic and onion. Pour the BBQ
sauce over all until the meat is covered. Mix well. Continue cooking
the pork in the crock pot for about three hours, on low. Serve the
BBQ pork on Kaiser rolls, onion rolls, pocketbook buns or any
speciality hamburger bun. Very Good.
