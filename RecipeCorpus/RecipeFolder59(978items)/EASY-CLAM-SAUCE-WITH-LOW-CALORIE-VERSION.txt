Title: EASY CLAM SAUCE WITH LOW-CALORIE VERSION
Categories: Fish and se, Pasta, Sauces and
Yield: 1 Servings
6 1/2 oz Can Minced Or Diced Clams
-see note
1 tb Olive Oil
1    Clove Garlic Minced
1 tb Oregano Or Basil -- or
Mixture
1/4 ts Salt
Few Grinds Of Pepper
* drain juice into small saucepan, and set clams aside.

Add garlic and seasonings to clam juice, bring to a simmer, and let
cook while the pasta cooks.  Drain pasta and return to pot in which
it was cooked. Remove juices from heat, add clams, and pour over
cooked pasta. Toss well and let stand a few minutes so juices can
permeate the pasta well before you serve it. I understand that it is
not chic to use grated parmesan or romano cheese with a seafood
sauce, but we love romano on this. These canned clams must not be
cooked--they turn into rocks if you do.
