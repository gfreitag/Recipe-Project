Title: EASY CROISSANTS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
1 c  Warm milk
1 ts Sugar
1 tb Yeast
1 c  Flour
3/4 c  Milk, room temperature
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg, beaten
1/2 c  Butter melted and cooled
4 c  Flour
1 c  Cold butter
1    Egg, beaten with cold water
Stir warm milk and sugar together.  Add yeast.  Let stand 10 minutes.
Stir well.  Add flour; beat well. Add milk, sugar and egg. Beat until
smooth. Add butter; beat and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, place
the 4 cups of flour and the chilled butter.  Cut butter into flour
until pieces are the size of beans (not too small). Pour the liquid
batter into the flour mixture; stir until moistened.  Cover the bowl
with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Remove from refrigerator. Press into a compact ball on a floured
board and divide into 4 parts. Roll each into a circle 12" or 16".
Cut each circle into 6 or 8 pie-shaped wedges.  For each croissant
roll a wedge towards the point. Shape into a crescent and place on
ungreased baking sheet.  Let rise at room temperature until doubled.
(May take 2 hours or more). Brush each with egg beaten with cold
water. Preheat oven to 400 F. Place croissants in oven. Lower
temperature to 350 F and bake for 15 - 20 minutes until golden. Makes
24 - 32.
