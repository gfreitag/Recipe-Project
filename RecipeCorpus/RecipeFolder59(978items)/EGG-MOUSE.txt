Title: EGG MOUSE
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Hard Boiled Eggs
2    Spring onions - or-
1 tb Chopped Fresh Chives
1 tb Lemon Juice
1    Tin Concentrated Consomme
6 tb Mayonnaise (not SALAD CREAM)
Salt and Pepper
Melt the consomme gently in a saucepan - do not bring it to the boil
~ then remove from the heat and add the lemon juice. As soon as it is
cool, chill it in the fridge. Trim the spring onions or chop the
chives and put them into a food processor or a liquidiser. Shell the
eggs, cut them in half and add them to the food processor. Whiz for a
few seconds, scrape down the sides, add the consomme mixture,
mayonnaise and seasoning and process for a few more seconds until
thoroughly blended. Do not over process - this is much nicer with a
light texture. Pour it all into a souffle dish and allow to set in
the fridge for at least two hours preferably four, to make sure the
whole lot goes firm. It can even be left overnight in the fridge
covered in cling film. This is nicest spooned out from the dish and
eaten with granary bread or toast.
