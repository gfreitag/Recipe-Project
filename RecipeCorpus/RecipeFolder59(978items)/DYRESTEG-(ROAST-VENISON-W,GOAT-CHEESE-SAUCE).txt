Title: DYRESTEG (ROAST VENISON W/GOAT CHEESE SAUCE)
Categories: Norwegian, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 lb Boneless haunch of venison
-or reindeer
3 tb Butter; softened
Salt & pepper
1 1/3 c  Beef stock
1 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
2 ts Red currant jelly
1/2 oz Brown Norwegian goat cheese;
-(Gjetst), finely diced
1/2 c  Sour cream
Preheat oven to 475øF. Tie the roaast up neatly at 1/2" intervals with
kitchen cord so that it will hold it's shape while cooking. With a
pastry brush, spread the softened butter evenly over the meat. Place
the roast on a rack in a shallow open roasting pan and sear it in the
hot oven for about 20 minutes. When the surface of the meat is quite
brown, reduce the heat to 375øF and sprinkle the roast generously
with salt and pepper. Pour the stock into the pan and cook the roast,
uncovered, for 1 1/4 hours. With a large spoon or bulb baster, baste
the meat with the pan juices every half hour or so. The interior
meat, when finished, should be slightly rare, or about 150øF on a
meat thermometer. Remove the roast to a heated platter, cover it
loosely and let rest in the turned off oven while you make the sauce.
Skim and discard the fat from the pan juices. Measure the remaining
liquid and either reduce to 1 cup by boiling it rapidly or add enough
water to make up 1 cup. In a small, heavy saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon
of butter and stir in 1 tablespoon of flour. Stirring continuously
with a wooden spoon, cook this roux for 6 to 8 minutes over low heat
until it is a nut brown color. Be careful not to let it burn or it
will give the sauce a bitter flavor. Now, with a wire whisk, beat the
pan juices into the roux. Next whisk in the jelly and cheese. Beat
until they dissolve and the sauce is absolutely smooth, then stir in
the sour cream. Do not allow the sauce to boil. Taste for seasoning,
remove the strings from the roast and carve the meat in thin slices.
Pass the sauce separately.
