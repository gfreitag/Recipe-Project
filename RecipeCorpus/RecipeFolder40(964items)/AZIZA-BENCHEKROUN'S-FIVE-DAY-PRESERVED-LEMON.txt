Wolfert writes: "If you run out of preserved lemons, or decide on
just a few day's notice to cook a chicken, lamb, or fish dish with
lemons and olives and need preserved lemons in a hurry, you can use
this quick five-day method taught to me by a Moroccan diplomat's
wife. Lemons preserved this way will not keep, but are perfectly
acceptable in an emergency."

With a razor blade, make 8 fine 2" vertical incisions around the peel
of each lemon to be used. (Do not cut deeper than the membrane that
protects the pulp.) Place the incised lemons in a stainless-steel
saucepan with plenty of salt and water to cover and boil until the
peels become very soft.  Place in a clean jar, covered with cooled
cooking liquor, and leave to pickle for approximately 5 days.
