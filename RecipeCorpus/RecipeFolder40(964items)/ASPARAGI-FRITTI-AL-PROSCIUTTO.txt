Categories: Vegetables, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
16    Fat asparagus spears
- washed and trimmed
- (See NOTE)
1 ts Salt
6 tb Butter
2    Eggs; beaten together

16 sm Slices prosciutto
1 tb Cooking oil
COOK ASPARAGUS IN BOILING salted water until barely tender, about 10
minutes. Drain in a colander, spray with cold water, and pat dry. Lay
asparagus out on a platter. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and drizzle
it over asparagus spears. Put beaten eggs on one plate and flour for
dredging on another. Heat remaining butter and oil in a skillet. Wrap
each asparagus spear in a slice of prosciutto. Roll them in flour
(brush off excess), dip in egg, and saute them until golden, about 2
minutes to a side. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. NOTE: If
there are no fat asparagus, use twice as many skinny ones; cook a few
minutes less and roll 2 spears in each slice of prosciutto.
