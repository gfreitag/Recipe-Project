Sea vegetables ran be added to soups or salads, cooked alone or with
other vegetables, and even brewed into teas. Their versatility in the
kitchen is as wide as the ocean. When dried, the succulence and
qualify of sea vegetables is not as apparent as when fresh, so it is
important to choose a brand you can trust. Eden (TM) brand sea
vegetables are the highest quality available, harvested from clean
Northern waters.
