Title: ARMENIAN EGGPLANT DIP
Categories: Spreads, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Batch
1 md Egg plant
1/4 c  Chopped red onion
1/2 c  Milk
1 tb Olive oil
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
Salt and pepper to taste
Freshly grated nutmeg
-- to taste
3 oz Parmesan cheese
Preheat oven to 400 F.

Prick eggplant with a fork in 10-12 places and rub with olive oil.
Bake uncovered for about an hour, or until the pulp feels quite soft.
Scoop out the pulp and place in a small saucepan. Add lemon juice and
cook over medium heat until the water has evaporated - about 5
minutes.

Saute the onion in butter. Blend enough of the flour in to make a
thick roux, then add milk slowly to form a thick sauce. Beat lightly
into the eggplant. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add the
Parmesan cheese and a few drops of warm milk if dip is too thick.

Store overnight in the refrigerator but bring to room temperature
before serving with crackers, bagel chips, or strips of crisped pita.
