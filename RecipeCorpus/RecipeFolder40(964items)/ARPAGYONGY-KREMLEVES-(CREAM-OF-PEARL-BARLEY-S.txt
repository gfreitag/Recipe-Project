Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Bones, pork & veal
2 ea Carrots; peeled, sliced
1 ea Parsnip; peeled, sliced
1/2 c  Pearl Barley; uncooked
3 tb Butter; clarified
1 tb Flour, all-purpose
1/3 c  Milk, whole
Salt
1/3 c  Heavy cream
1 ea Egg yolks
Cook bones and vegetables in 1 1/2 quarts water for about 2 hours.
Keep skimming the broth to remove scum. Strain. Add enough water to
bring the amount to 1 1/2 quarts again. Add barley to the broth and
cook until it is soft.
Make a roux with butter and flour. Cook the roux over low heat,
stirring constantly, but do not let it become dark. This should be a
light roux. Stir 1/3 cup cold water and 1/3 cup cold milk into the
roux and whip until smooth. Pour into soup and simmer it for 10
minutes.
Puree the soup in a blender or through a sieve. Adjust the salt to
taste. Mix cream with egg yolk and put it in a soup tureen. Just
before serving, pour hot creamed soup over the yolk and cream mixture.
