Title: ARTICHOKE-STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Jaw
Yield: 6 Servings
6    4 oz chicken breasts
1    Clove garlic
1 1/2 c  Frozen or canned artichoke
Hearts, rinsed and drained
1    Egg yolk
2 tb Heavy cream
1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
Dash nutmeg
1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley,
Divided
1/4 c  Chicken broth
Paprika
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a baking pan.

Salt and pepper the chicken breasts. With a very sharp small knife,
cut a pocket horizontally into each breast. Do not cut in half. Set
aside while you make the stuffing.

In a food processor, place the garlic, artichoke hearts, egg yolk,
cream, bread crumbs, nutmeg and about 1/4 cup of parsley. Process to
mix, but do not puree.

Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of stuffing in each breast pocket. Do not
close the pocket-the stuffing will puff up and out a bit.

Place the stuffed breasts in the baking dish. Pour the chicken broth
over the chicken. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake 12 to 15 minutes. Place
the breasts on a platter, spoon the pan juices over and sprinkle with
reserved 2 tablespoons parsley.
