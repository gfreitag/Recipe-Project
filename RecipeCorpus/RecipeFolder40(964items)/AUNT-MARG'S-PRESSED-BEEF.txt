The author writes:  "Spread on hot buttered toast, this protein-rich
snack is ideal for chilled skiers or skaters. Blade steaks, blade
roast, cross rib roast and stewing beef are all suitable cuts."

Place beef (bones, fat and all) into a large, heavy stockpot with the
soup bone, onion, carrot, bay leaf and salt. Cover with cold water
and bring to the boil, uncovered. Skim off any foam and cook two
hours or more (until beef falls off the bone).  Cover pot; let stand
in a cool place overnight to solidify fat. Next day, skim off and
discard fat, along with carrots, onions and bay leaf.  Remove meat
from bones and discard bones. Shred beef with a knife.  Return
shredded meat to stock in the pot; place over high heat.  Add
pickling spices (tied in bag) and let come to a boil. Add consomme.
Once stock is boiling, add gelatin. Stir and let simmer another 1
minute.

Spoon stock plus beef into a large mold or ceramic bowl (or two
smaller ones) and let sit in refrigerator, several hours or overnight.

Good with hot mustard, salt and pepper.  Keeps well, refrigerated, 1
week.

Yield:  6 to 8 servings.
