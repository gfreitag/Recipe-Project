Title: APPLESAUCE OATMEAL DROPS
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 c  White sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Natural unsweetened
Applesauce
1 c  Rolled oats
1 c  Sifted all purpose flour
1/2 c  Seedless raisins
Mix sugars and add applesauce.  Sift together dry ingrediants and
stir in. Add oats and raisins.  Drop by spoonfuls onto lightly
greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees about 10 minutes.

Note:  I left out the raisins because I don't care for them. Also, I
added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  The next time I make these I may cut back
on the sugar because they are rather sweet. These cookies were nice
and fluffy (for a fat-less cookie) and remind me of muffins. These
are so quick and easy to make, I just love them! I hope everyone
enjoys them.
