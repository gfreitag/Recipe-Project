Recipe by: HBWK07A    Chuck Ozburn In a small dry skillet, toast the

about 2 minutes; grind in a spice mill or a mortar; heat a large
enameled cast-iron casserole;  season the brisket with salt and
pepper; working in batches, add the meat to the casserole and cook
over moderately high heat until well browned  all  over, about 8
minutes; transfer each batch to a large plate; add  the garlic,
jalapenos and onions to the casserole and cook over moderate heat,
stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes; add the
commercial chili powder, pure red chile powder, coriander and half of
the ground cumin; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes; return the cooked
brisket to the casserole; add the beef stock, tomatoes and the
oregano; bring to a boil over moderately high heat, then lower the
heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for  3 hours; stir in
the ground chuck, season with salt and cook until the brisket is very
tender and the sauce has thickened, about 1 hour longer; stir in the
remaining cumin and simmer for 15 minutes; garnish with the scallions
and serve. 6 to 8 servings. Jonathan Levine Director of the New York
