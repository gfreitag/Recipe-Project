Title: ASE JUP JING HA (STEAMED PRAWNS WITH BLACK BE
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Prawns; raw
1 1/4 tb Beans, black
1    Garlic cloves; chopped
1    Scallions; chopped
1 tb Oil
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Oil
1 1/2 ts Soy sauce, light
1 ts Wine, white
1 ts Oyster sauce
Prepare the prawns by cutting off whiskers, cutting along the top
of the shell, and deveining them.  Leave the shells on the prawns
because this keeps the prawns more tender, tasty and plump. Wash,
drain and put prawns in a pie pan so as to be ready for steaming.
Wash black beans two times and mash into a paste; then add the
chopped garlic.
Combine remaining ingredients, EXCEPT the oil. Pour mixture over
prawns; then, pour oil on top. Cover and steam 10 minutes. Serve over
rice.
