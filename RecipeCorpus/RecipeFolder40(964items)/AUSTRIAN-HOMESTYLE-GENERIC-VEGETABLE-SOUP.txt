Title: AUSTRIAN HOMESTYLE GENERIC VEGETABLE SOUP
Categories: Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 3 Servings
4 tb Butter or margarine (or oil,
-or lard)
3 tb All purpose flour
1 1/2 pt Water
3 1/2 ts Knorr Beef Flavor Consomme
-Mix (or similar bouillon
Powder or cubes)
2 tb Chopped onion
1 md Carrot, diced
2 c  (approx.) broccoli or
-cauliflower, cut into small
-pieces
1 md Potato, peeled and diced
Melt butter over medium heat.  Add flour, stirring constantly, until
the mixture becomes puffy.  Add water, bouillon powder, onions,
potatoes and carrots. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce
heat and simmer until potatoes are almost done (about 5 to 6
minutes). Add broccoli and return to boil.  Simmer for another minute.

Makes 3 large servings (which with a chunk of French bread or the like
would make a hearty meal, quantity-wise.)

VARIATIONS:  For thinner soup, use less flour.  For vegetables with a
more delicate flavor, use less bouillon powder. If using sliced
mushrooms, asparagus and frozen or fresh green peas as vegetables,
use slightly less flour, slightly less bouillon powder, and a dash of
sugar. (Start with the asparagus, adding peas and mushrooms when
asparagus is almost done. No onion in that one, BTW, it would
overwhelm the other flavors.) If all you've got is potatoes and
onions, add quarter teaspoon caraway seeds early on (when you reduce
to simmering). What, not even potatoes? Throw in somewhat more
chopped onion and add rice, and serve with fresh chopped parsley.
