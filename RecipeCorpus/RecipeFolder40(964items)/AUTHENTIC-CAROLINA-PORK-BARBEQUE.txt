Title: AUTHENTIC CAROLINA PORK BARBEQUE
Categories: Pork & ham, Bar-b-q
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Pork butt (shoulder)
1 ga Cider vinegar
10 oz Worcestershire sauce
6 oz Chili sauce
1 1/4 oz Crushed red pepper flakes
Mix all sauce ingredients together.  Use as a basting sauce for the
meat.

The pork has to be barbecued - that is, cooked long and slow over a
real wood fire, preferably hickory. Temp should be around 220
degrees, and it takes at least 1-1/2 hours per pound, or until
internal temp. reaches 150-160 degrees.  Needless to say, this is
difficult to accomplish in the average backyard Weber kettle,
although it can be done. It has to be served on a CWB:  Cheap White
Bun.  After that, the only question is "with or without?" Sweet cole
slaw on top, that is.
