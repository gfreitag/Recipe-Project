Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
3/4 c  Heavy cream
2 1/4 ts Flour
1/4 c  Sugar, plus additional for
--dusting souffle dish
8 lg Fresh apricots; 4 diced,
--4 sliced
1 ts Kirsch
3    X-large eggs, separated at
--room temperature
Pinch cream of tartar
1 ts Butter
Confectioner's sugar
Preheat oven to 450 F.  Combine cream, flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and diced
apricots in a large saucepan.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat and
cook, whisking until thick, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, add
kirsch, then wisk in egg yolks one at a time.

Beat egg whites in a nonreactive mixing bowl until foamy; add cream of
tartar; continue to beat until very stiff.

Butter a small souffle dish (6 1/2 " diameter, 2 1/2" deep), dust with
sugar, and spread 1/4 cup apricot mixture on bottom. Add about a
third of the egg whites to the remaining apricot mixture; gently fold
together. Repeat, carefully folding in remaining egg whites in two
batches. Do not overmix.  Spoon over apricot mixture in souffle dish.

Make sure oven rack is low enough to allow souffle room to rise 2"
above rim of dish.  Bake souffle until lightly browned on top, 12-15
minutes. Dust generously with confectioner's sugar and arrange sliced
apricots on top.  Serve immediately. (Souffle will coninue to cook as
it rests; start eating on the outside and work your way into the
middle.)
