Title: AULD ALLIANCE
Categories: Cheese, Scottish
Yield: 4 Servings
350 g  Roquefort cheese
Whisky
This deceptively simple cheese cream from Overscaig in Sutherland is
delicious served as a cream pate for the first course or at the end
of a meal as a savoury.

Pound the cheese to a thick cream. Add drop by drop as much whisky as
it will 'drink' to make a firm cream.

Pack into small earthenware pots and chill in the fridge for 3 to 4
hours.

Serve with hot buttered toast or oatcakes.
