Serves: 6 Cooking time: 1 to 1-1/4 hours Sift flour and salt into a
bowl, add water and mix to a firm dough, adding more flour if
necessary. Divide into 2 balls and wrap in plastic.  Rest for 30
minutes. On a floured board roll out each ball of dough very thinly.
Cut into 5 mm (1/4-inch) strips either while it is flat or by rolling
up each sheet of dough and slicing with a sharp knife.  Place noodles
on a floured cloth, dust with flour and leave to dry for about 30
minutes. Wash split peas well and place in a pan with 1-1/2 cups cold
water.  Bring to the boil and boil gently for 30 minutes or until
tender.  Add red beans and liquid and keep warm. In a large pot bring
8 cups water to the boil, add 2 teaspoons salt, oil and noodles.  Put
noodles in gradually, stirring after each addition. Return to the
boil and cook uncovered for 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook for
further 5 minutes.  Drain in a colander and return to the pot. Add
split peas and bean mixture with its liquid, toss ingredients lightly
and keep hot over low heat. In a frying pan heat the 1/2 cup oil, fry
onion until soft and add ground meat. Stir over high heat until
juices evaporate and meat browns lightly. Add salt and pepper to
taste, tomato puree and water, cover and simmer 10 minutes, then
remove cover and let moisture evaporate. Sauce should be oily.
Combine chakah ingredients, add to noodles and toss well. Mixture
should be moist. Place noodle mixture in a deep dish and top with
keema.  Stir at the table and serve in deep plates.
