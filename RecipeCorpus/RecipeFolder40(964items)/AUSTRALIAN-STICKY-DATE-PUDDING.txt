This Australian recipe, a very moist cake, not what we'd call a
pudding, has taken Down Under by storm. you'll find it on restaurant
and dinner party menus across that country. This version was printed
recently by the New York times.

TO PREPARE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch round
baking pan withsides at least 2 inches high, such as a springform pan.

Place the dates in a saucepan and cover with water (about 1-1/2 cups).
Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Add the
baking soda (the mixture will foam) and set aside.

In a bowl, cream the cut up butter, sugar and eggs, adding the eggs
one at a time. Gently mix in the flour, salt and vanilla. Stowly stir
in the baking powder and 1/4 cup of the liquid from cooking the
dates, until the cake mixture resembles thick pancake batter. Drain
off remainder of date cooking liquid and discard. Stir in the dates.

Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked in the center.

TO PREPARE CARAMEL SAUCE: Combine the butter, whipping cream, brown
sugar and vanilla. Bring to a boil; reduce to simmer, and cook for 3
minutes.

TO SERVE: Drizzle some of the sauce over the cake as it is cooling.
Serve the rest of the sauce separately.
