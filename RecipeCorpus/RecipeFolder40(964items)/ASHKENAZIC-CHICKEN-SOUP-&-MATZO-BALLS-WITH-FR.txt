2 lb Chicken wings or drumsticks
9 c  Cold water
1 lg Onion, peeled

1 sm Parsnip, peeled (opt)
2    Celery stalks, including

1 tb Snipped fresh dill
MMMMM------------------------MATZO BALLS-----------------------------
2 lg Eggs
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Matzo meal
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Water or chicken soup
2 qt Salted water for simmering
Combine chicken wings, water, onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, parsley
and dill sprigs, and pinch of salt to a large saucepan and bring to a
boil. Partly cover and simmer 2 hours, skimming occasionally. Skim
off excess fat. (Chicken soup can be kept 3 days in refrigerator or
can be frozen; reheat before serving.)

Make matzo balls: In a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs with oil. Add
matzo meal, salt and stir until smooth. Stir in water, then let
mixture stand for 20 minutes so matzo meal absorbs liquid.

Bring salted water to a boil. With wet hands, roll about 1 teaspoon of
matzo ball mixture between your palms into a ball; mixture will be
very soft. Set balls on a plate. With a rubber spatula, carefully
slide balls into boiling water. Cover and simmer over low heat for
about 30 minutes or until firm. Cover and keep warm until ready to
serve. (Matzo balls can be kept 2 days in their cooking liquid in a
covered container in refrigerator; reheat gently in cooking liquid or
in soup.)

To serve soup, remove chicken wings, onion, celery, parsnip, parsley
and dill sprigs. Take meat off bones and add to soup; or reserve for
other uses. Add pepper to soup, stir in snipped dill and taste soup
for seasoning. Slice carrot and add a few slices to each bowl. With a
slotted spoon, add a few matzo balls. Serve hot.
