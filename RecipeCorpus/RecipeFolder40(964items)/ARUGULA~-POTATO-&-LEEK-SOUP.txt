Categories: Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 tb Oil
2 md Leek; trimmed, cleaned
-thoroughly, & chopped
1 md Onion; sliced (1 c)
1 ts Fennel seeds, ground
1 1/4 lb Potato; peeled & coarsely
-cubed
3 c  Chicken broth
1 1/2 c  ;Water
10 oz Arugula; washed, trimmed,
-to yield 4 cups packed
Pepper & salt; as needed
2 tb Ricard or Pernod
12 tb Yogurt
4    Arugula leaf; finely
-slivered (garnish)
Heat oil in large pot.  Add leeks and onion; cook over moderately low
heat, stirring often, until softened - about 10 min. Sprinkle with
fennel and stir 30 seconds.

Add potatoes, broth, and water.  Simmer 25 min, until soft. Add
arugula and cook about 10 min longer, or until stems are soft. Add
salt, pepper and liquor to taste.

Puree to rough or smooth texture, as you like.  Adjust seasoning.
Serve hot or chilled, topped with yogurt and garnished with arugula
slivers. As watercress changes potato soup into something that
doesn't taste quite like any of the individual ingredients, so
arugula transforms this traditional soup base.

Flexible, the soup can be pureed to a chunky or a smooth texture, and
served hot, as a main dish, or chilled, as a first course.
