Slowly drizzle the apricot nectar into the egg white mixture while
beating the mixture on a low speed. Then beat the mixture on medium

for 45 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center of
the cake comes out clean.  Cool the cake in the pan on a rack for 10

In a small saucepan, stir together the sugar, buttermilk, margarine
and vanilla.  Bring to a boil without stirring. Reduce heat and
gently boil for one minute.

Invert the cake onto a serving platter and remove the pan. While the
cake is still warm, use a toothpick to poke holes in it. Then pour
the glaze over the cake.

Cool before serving.

To store - cover the cake and refrigerate.
