Title: ARIZONA DESERT CHILI
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
3    Garlic cloves -- chopped
2    Onions -- chopped
1    Green bell peppers --
Chopped
3 lb Beef
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Ground oregano
3 tb Chili powder
10    Tomatoes -- peeled and
Chopped
2    Jalapeno peppers --
Optional
1 cn Beer
* Have beef chopped, not ground.

1. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add garlic, onions and green
pepper. Saute until soft, about 5-7 minutes. 2. Add beef and lightly
brown on all surfaces. Drain off some of the fat if a lot has
accumulated. Lean beef trimmed of all fat should not have an excess
amount, however. 3. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 1 hour
or slightly longer. Put a cover on skillet during cooking time, and
slightly tilt it so steam can escape. Check often and stir to prevent
sticking. Skim off fat as it rises. Best if allowed to sit, tightly
covered, for an hour after cooking is complete.
