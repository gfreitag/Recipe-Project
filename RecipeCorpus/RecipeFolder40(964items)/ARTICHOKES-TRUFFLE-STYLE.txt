The description "Truffle style" means they are cooked as truffles
would be (sliced paper thin and quickly fried with a little oil, salt
and pepper).

Prepare artichokes as directed in "Cleaning artichokes ~ Jewish
Style". Cut in half lengthwise and keep in lemon water. "Heat 1/4 cup
of oil in a large skillet. Drain 6 artichokes very well. Cut into
very thin slivers directly into the hot oil and fry, stirring
frequently, for 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and continue
to fry until slices are golden brown and crisp. Transfer to a hot
serving dish and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining oil and
artichokes.
