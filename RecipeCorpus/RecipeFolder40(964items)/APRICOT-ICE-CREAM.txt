Title: APRICOT ICE CREAM
Categories: Low fat, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Dried apricots
1/4 pt (5 fl oz) water
1/2 pt (10 fl oz) natural,
Unsweetened, low fat yogurt
1/4 pt (5 fl oz) fromage frais, if
Available
2 tb Lemon juice
4 oz Icing sugar
If not, use more yogurt
Put apricots and water in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer
for 20 minutes.  Allow to cool, then puree the result in a blender or
food processor, add the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly.
Freeze, stirring regularly.  An ice-cream maker would be even better,
but I don't have one.
