Oven-Crisp Tortilla Chips:  Here's an easy way to make your own
tortilla chips without frying them.  Cut flour tortillas into wedges
with kitchen shears or a knife. Place the wedges on an ungreased
baking sheet and toast in a 350F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or till
dry and crisp. You'll find they're sturdy for dipping, there's no
messy cleanup, and the chips are lower in calories than those you buy
in the store.
