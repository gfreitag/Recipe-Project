Artichokes
1. Pull off dark green outer leaves of artichokes until you reach the
pale green "heart." Cut 1/2-inch off top and trim stem end down to
the pale green part. Rub artichoke hearts well with lemon and cook in
boiling salted water until tender. Drain and pat dry. Pull out some
of the innermost leaves and spread the hearts open slightly.

2. In a bowl combine crabmeat, cream, capers, green pepper, green
onion, and mustard. In a small skillet over moderate heat, heat
butter and oil. Add shallots and cook until translucent (4 to 5
minutes). Add wine and cook until mixture is reduced to a glaze. Cool
slightly and add to crab mixture. Season with salt, pepper, and
Worcestershire sauce.

3. Stuff artichoke hearts with crab mixture. Pack into a tightly
sealed container along with a plastic bag of minced parsley and the
lemon wedges. At serving time, garnish hearts with minced parsley and
serve with lemon wedges.
