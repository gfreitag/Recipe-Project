soft. In a large measuring cup, place lemon juice with one cup of
reserved chicken stock. Set aside. In large mixing bowl beat eggs on
high speed for 4 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and continue beating

mixture, pour 2 cups of reserved chicken stock slowly, while
continuously mixing. Turn mixer off. Pour egg and lemon mixture
slowly into saucepan of rice and stock, stirring continually.
