COMBINE apricots and water in a saucepan; let stand 8 hours.

STIR in 2 1/2 cups sugar; cook over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture boils. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer,
stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Uncover and increase heat to
medium-high; cook, stirring often, 8-10 minutes or until thickened.
Remove from heat; cool slightly. Stir in extracts and, if desired,
liqueur; cool.

UNFOLD 1 pie crust, and press out fold lines. Cut to fit into the
bottom of a deep 2-quart baking dish, reserving excess pastry.

SPOON half of apricot mixture into dish; top with reserved pastry.

BAKE at 475 degrees F. for 12 minutes or until lightly browned. Spoon
remaining apricot mixture over pastry; cool.

UNFOLD remaining pie crust; roll to 1/8-inch thickness, and cut into
1-inch strips. Arrange in a lattice design over apricot mixture.

and almonds, and bake 2 to 3 more minutes. Serve warm with Custard
Sauce.
