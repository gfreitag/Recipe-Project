Title: APPLES IN RED WINE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 kg Apples (2 1/4 lb)
-- You NEED an apple that
-- will hold its shape
-- during cooking !!
5 dl Red wine ( 1 pint)
1    Stick cinnamon
250 g  Sugar (9 oz)
Ten hours in advance, cook the wine, cinnamon and sugar over a brisk
heat for 10 minutes, using a broad, shallow saucepan.

Peel the apples and, using a melon-baller of about 2.5 cm (1 in)
diameter, cut them into little balls.

Throw the apple-balls into the hot wine. They should not overlap:
this is why you need a broad, shallow pan. Simmer them for 5 to 7
minutes, covered with aluminium foil to keep them submerged.

When the apples are cooked but still firm, remove the pan from the
stove. Let the apple-balls macerate in the red wine for about 10
hours to take on a good red colour.

Serving: well chilled, with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, or in a
selection of cold fruit desserts.
