*Chicken broth can be used in place of wine if desired. Trim excess
fat from pork; set steaks aside. Ream the juice from the orange. In a
9 x 13 pan, combine orange juice, oregano, cumin, lemon peel, and
lemon juice. Turn meat in mixture to coat well; set aside. Mix onions
with liquid, then set meat back into pan topping with half the onion
mixture. Cover and let stand at least 30 minutes, or cover and chill
up to overnight. Melt 1 tabl. of margarine in a 12-inch frying pan
over medium high heat; scrape onions from meat and add steaks to pan.
Cook until meat is browned on both sides, 10-12 minutes then lift out
and set aside. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of margarine to pan on
medium high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of margarine to pan
on medium high heat. Add onion marinade, bell peppers, and garlic.
Cook stirring occasionally until onions are soft about 10 minutes.
Return pork to pan.  Add taco sauce and wine.  Bring to a boil;
cover, reduce heat, and simmer until pork is very tender when
pierced, 1 to 1-1/4 hours.  Lift out pork and place on a platter;
keep warm. On high heat, boil pan mixture, stirring until most of
liquid has evaporated, 8-10 min. Pour over pork and garnish with
cilantro. Serve with tortillas; add salt and pepper to taste. SOURCE:
