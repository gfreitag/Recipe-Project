18 sl Soft white bread; crusts
-removed
3 tb Unsalted butter; melted
6 oz Marinated artichoke hearts
-drained & finely chopped
3 tb Mayonnaise
1 tb Scallion; finely chopped

1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
1 tb Parmesan cheese; grated
Roll each bread slice flat with a rolling pin and trim it to form a 2
1/2" square.  Brush both sides of the squares lightly with the butter
and fit th squares into gem muffin tins, pressing the bread against
the sides of the tins.  Bake the croustades in the middle of a
preheated 350 deg. oven 12-14 minutes, oruntil the edges are pale
golden. These may be made 2 days in advance & kept in an airtight
container. In a bowl stir together the artich hearts, mayonnaise, 1
tb of the scallion, 1/4 c of the Parmesan, and salt & pepper to
taste. Divide the mixture by heaping teaspoons among the croustad and
sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on top. Broil the croustades under a
preheated broiler about 6" from the heat, being careful not to let
the croustade edges burn, for 1 minute, or until the filling is
bubbling. Garni the croustades with the scallion green and arrange 3
of them on each of 6 small plates. From Best of Gourmet 1992.
