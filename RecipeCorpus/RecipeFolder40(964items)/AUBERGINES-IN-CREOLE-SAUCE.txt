Browned slices of aubergine, sprinkled with breadcrumbs and baked
until golden are served with an exotic, spiced tomato sauce. Lovely
with a crisp salad and some noodles or rice.

Fry the sliced aubergines briskly in the olive oil for 2-3 minutes on
each side. Cook a few slices at a time. When all the aubergine slices
are cooked, return them to the pan.

Mix the shallots, garlic, parsley and breadcrumbs together. Sprinkle
this mixture over the aubergines, season and cook over a low heat for
a further 10 minutes.
