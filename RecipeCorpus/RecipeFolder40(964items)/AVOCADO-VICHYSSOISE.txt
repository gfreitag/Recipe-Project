:
6 c  milk -- up to 8 cups

1/2 c  sour cream
1 ts chipotle chile -- pureed

1. Steam or boil the potatoes until soft and let cool. Meanwhile,
roast, peel, and seed the poblanos. Roast the tomatillos and onions
until lightly charred.

2. Combine the roasted vegetables and potatoes in a food processor or
blender and puree. Add the serrano chile, cilantro, mint, lime juice,
ginger, and avocado and puree until smooth, adding milk as necessary
to facilitate the blending. Transfer to a bowl or storage container
and thin to the desired texture with milk. Add salt and pepper to
taste. Chill.

3. Taste the chilled soup for seasoning and correct if necessary. Mix
the sour cream and chipotle chile together and drizzle over each bowl
soup as a garnish.

Note: Normally this soup is served cold, but it can be reheated
gently and served warm.  If you prefer it less spicy, leave out the
chipotle garnish and simply garnish with a sprig cilantro. Serves 8
to 10

"The avocado in this soup turns a traditional potato-based soup into
something the French would never recognize! Because of the richness
of the avocado, we can use milk instead of cream without compromising
the texture." Source: Contemporary Southwest, The Terra Cotta
