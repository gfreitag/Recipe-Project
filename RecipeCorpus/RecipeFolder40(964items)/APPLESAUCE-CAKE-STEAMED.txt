Title: APPLESAUCE CAKE STEAMED
Categories: Dessert, Steamed foo
Yield: 10 Servings
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Applesauce
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/4 ts Nutmeg -- (opt.)
1/4 ts Allspice -- (opt.)
1 c  Walnuts -- chopped
In bowl cream butter; gradually add sugar to the creamed butter.
Thoroughly mix until fluffy. Add applesauce. Sift together all dry
ingredients, then add those to the mixture. Add the nuts, and stir
well. Pour cake mixture into wide-mouth canning jars. WARNING: Please
use only canning jars that are specially tempered. Do not use cans or
other jars that may not be appropriate for this method due to lead
content. Or, use a special crockpot baking pan available thruough
Rival Co. To assure that baked cakes will slip out easily, grease
inside of jars well. (Lining bottom of jars with waxed paper also
will help.) Cover each jar with a piece of foil greased on one side.
Place greased side down and press foil around edges to seal tightly.
Place jars in crockpot with crockery liner in place. Cover; cook on
high-heat setting for 2 3/4 to 3 hours or till cakes spring back when
touched and a wooden tothpick inserted near the centers comes out
clean. Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes. Unmold cakes; remove
waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with whipped topping, if desired.
