With a Japanese rotary slicer, cut cucumber into 1 long spiral.

slices.) In a bowl toss cucumber with vinegar, sugar, red pepper
flakes, and salt to taste.

In another bowl whisk together egg white, soy sauce and gingerroot
until combined well and stir in salmon, bread crumbs, scallions,
mustard seeds, and salt to taste. In a food processor puree 1/3 cup
salmon mixture and return to salmon mixture remaining in bowl.
(Alternatively, chop 1/3 cup salmon mixture fine and mash to a paste
with flat side of a knife.) Stir mixture to combine and form into
four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Drain cucumber well.

In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until
hot but not smoking and cook patties until golden, about 2 minutes on
each side. Cook patties, covered, over moderate heat until just
cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Arrange lettuce leaves on 4
pumpernickel slices and top with salmon burgers, pickled cucumber,
and remaining 4 pumpernickel slices.
