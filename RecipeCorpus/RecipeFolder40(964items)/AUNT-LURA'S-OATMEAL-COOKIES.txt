Rich, this is an old favorite of mine, from my great-grandmother.
Thought everyone would enjoy it.  I love them, and so does the rest
of my family. They were always part of Christmas baking for us.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine shortening, oats, flour, sugar,
raisins, milk, cinnamon, soda and salt. It should stick together when
you squeeze a small amount in your hand. Drop small amounts on sheet.
Bake 10 minutes.

Hope you try them, they are the best I've ever tasted, though I'm
probably biased.
