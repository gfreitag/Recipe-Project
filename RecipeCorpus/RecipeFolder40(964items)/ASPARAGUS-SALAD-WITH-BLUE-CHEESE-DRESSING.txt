Categories: Salads, Healthy, Dressing
Yield: 4 Servings
28    Asparagus spears -- trimmed
1/2 c  Nonfat yogurt
1 tb Blue cheese -- crumbled
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 tb Chives
1    Clove garlic -- peeled and
Minced
2    Tomatoes -- cored and

Salt and pepper -- to taste
1/2 c  Fennel
Bring water to the boil in the bottom of a steamer. Fit the baket
into the steamer.  Steam the asparagus over medium high heat for
about 6 minutes, until bright green and tender. Remove the steamer
from the heat and let the asparagus cool.

Combine the yogurt and blue cheese in a small saucepan. Warm over low
heat for 1 to 2 minutes, whisking constantly, just until the blue
cheese has melted.  Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the
lemon juice, chives and garlic.

Arrange the asparagus in the centrer of a serving plate and ring with
the tomato wedges. Drizzle the yogurt dressing over the asparagus.
Sprinkle with the salt and pepper and garnish with the fennel.
