supermarkets. If you can't find them don't worry, the recipe will
still work OK.

The Javanese seem to like their chicken pretty well done and chewy. I
prefer mine a little more tender and fry it for a bit less than ten
minutes. It has been a while since I made this, but I believe about
seven minutes is enough for me. This chicken is delicious and also
good cold. Make lots of it.
