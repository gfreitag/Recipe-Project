Title: AUBERGINES IN SESAME SAUCE
Categories: Vegetables, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
2 tb Sesame seeds
1 tb Soy sauce
4 sm Aubergines
Vegetable oil
- for deep frying
Sesame seeds to garnish
Browned sesame seeds, pounded with a little soy sauce, make an
interesting coating for deep-fried aubergines, and give them an added
subtlety of flavour. Serve them warm, with a rice dish - or chilled,
with a salad meal.

In a small heavy pan shake the sesame seeds over a moderate heat,
stirring and shaking the pan, for 4-5 minutes until golden. Reserve
1/4 tsp of the sesame seeds and transfer the rest to a mortar. Crush
them with the soy sauce.

Cut the aubergines in half lengthwise, and cut each half diagonally
into thirds. Deep-fry the aubergine in very hot vegetable oil for 1
minute or until just tender. Dry on paper towels. While the aubergine
is still warm toss it with the sesame mixture. Put on to a
serving-dish and garnish with the reserved sesame seeds.
