Emmenthaler is a dry, aged cheese that accents the flavor of
asparagus. Serve as the main course of a light lunch or supper.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Snap coarse ends off asparagus stalks leaving
spears about 3 1/2-inches long. (Save the trimmed-off ends to use for
soup.) Peel the asparagus spears using a swivel-bladed vegetable
peeler, lay them flat in a large heavy skillet, pour in boiling
salted water and set over moderate heat. Cover and cook asparagus for
about 10 minutes, until very tender. Drain well, return to the
skillet and shake over moderate heat for 30 seconds or so to
dissipate any excess moisture. Arrange the asparagus spears like the
spokes of a wheel over the bottom of the pie crust, with their tips
pointing toward the center. Combine the milk, cream, eggs, Parmesan
cheese, Kirschwasser, salt, dill, mace and pepper, and pour the
liquid evenly over the asparagus. Bake the tart, uncovered, for 35
minutes, or until the filling has set. Remove the tart from the oven
and cool it for at least 20 minutes before cutting.
