Topping: Toast pecans on ungreased baking sheet at 450F. until lightly

Melt butter in small, heavy saucepan.  Add brown sugar and cook,
stirring just until melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Watch closely because
sugar burns easily.

spread to coat bottom.  Sprinkle chopped pecans on top of
butter-sugar mixture. Place apples in concentric circles, slightly
overlapping, over pecans.

Cake: Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt into bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat butter at medium speed until light and
fluffy. add sugar and continue beating until creamy, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add egg and vanilla and continue beating until completely
incorporated.

Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture and milk, alternating in 3
additions.  Continue to mix only until dry ingredients are completely
mixed in, stopping to scrape sides if necessary.

Spoon cake batter over topping and spread carefully so batter is
even. Bake at 325F. until tester comes out clean, about 55 minutes.

Cool in pan 10 to 15 minutes.  Carefully run spatula around edge of
pan and let stand another 10 to 15 minutes. Invert pan over large
plate and let stand about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pan. Serve warm
with fresh whipped cream.
