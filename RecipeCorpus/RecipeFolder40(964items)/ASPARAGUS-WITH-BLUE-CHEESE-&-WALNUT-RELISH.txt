Place blue cheese, walnuts, onions, parsley and lemon zest in a bowl
and mix well.  (Blue cheese relish can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and
refrigerate. Bring to room temperature 30 minutes before serving.) To
prepare asparagus, cut off and discard tough, woody ends of stalks.
Bring enough water to cover asparagus to boil in a large deep
saucepan or skillet.  Lightly salt water and add the asparagus.
Simmer until just tender, 3-5 minutes.  Remove asparagus and drain
well. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

To serve, arrange asparagus on heated platter or in a shallow serving
bowl. Top with blue cheese relish. Serve hot.
