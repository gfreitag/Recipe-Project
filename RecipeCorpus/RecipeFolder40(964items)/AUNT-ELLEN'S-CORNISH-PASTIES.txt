AUNT ELLEN NOTT'S CORNISH PASTY RECIPE Aunt Ellen was born in 1851
and was 85 years old when she taught me [Mabel Weller] (in Cornwall
1938) to make pasties. I like to think that she had been taught by
her mother. The ingredients are simple: pie crust, cubed round steak,
onions and potatoes, salt and pepper. Turnip or leeks can be used for
a change of flavour. All ingredients are raw. Roll out pie crust and
cut into rounds or ovals about the size of a butter plate. On one
half of the pie crust arrange, in this order, a few slices of potato,
a layer of onion, a pile of steak and the salt and pepper. Moisten
the edge of the crust around the filling, and fold the bare crust
over. Seal the edge very well or the onion juices will run out and
make the pasty stick to the baking dish. Cut two vents in the top.
Bake at 400 F for about an hour. Modern pasties seem to be made with
leftovers: ground up cooked meat and left over assorted vegetables
mixed together in a pastry which is joined in a thick roll at the
top. This was reported by recent visitors to the U.K.
