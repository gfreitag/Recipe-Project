Jim Vorheis
1 1/2 c  Unconverted long-grain rice
1/3 c  Safflower oil, melted
-chicken fat, or melted lard
3 tb Finely chopped white onion
2    Chilies poblanos, charred,
-peeled, and cut in strips
4 c  Chicken broth
1    Garlic clove, peeled and
-roughly chopped
1 c  Firmly packed, roughly
-chopped flat-leaf parsley
1/2 c  Firmly packed, roughly
-chopped epazote or cilantro
Sea salt to taste
Green Rice
Put the rice into a bowl and pour very hot water over to cover; stir
and set aside for 10 minutes.  Drain in a strainer and rinse in cold
water; drain again and set aside.

Heat the oil in a heavy pan, stir the rice into it, and fry over
fairly high heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, for
about 5 minutes.  Add the onion and chile strips and continue frying
for 4 minutes or until the onion is translucent.

Meanwhile, put 1 cup of the broth into a blender jar; add the garlic,
parsley, and epazote and blend until smooth. Add this to the frying
rice and continue frying and reducing the puree over quite high heat,
stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the rice is dry.
Stir in the rest of the broth, add salt to taste, and cook over
fairly high heat, uncovered, until the liquid has been absorbed and
there are air holes in the rice. Cover with a towel and lid and
continue cooking over low heat for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat
and set aside, still covered, in a warm place for the rice to swell
up.  Before serving, turn the rice over with a fork from the bottom
where a lot of the flavor and oil will have settled.
