shell of flesh. Sprinkle each shell with salt, then turn over and
leave to drain for 30 minutes. Chop up the remaining flesh.

Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4.

Dry-fry the lamb and chopped aubergine over a moderate heat for 5
minutes, stirring frequently until browned. Drain off any fat, then
add the garlic and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Remove pan from
heat.

Add the spring onion, tomatoes, grated lemon rind, mint and seasoning
to taste. Mix well and bind with the beaten egg.

Rinse the aubergine halves and pat dry with kitchen paper. Fill the
shells with the prepared stuffing mixture, packing down firmly. Place
in an oiled ovenproof dish and drizzle with the oil. Cover and bake
in the preheated oven for 40 minutes or until aubergines are tender,
basting occasionally with the oil in the dish.

Garnish with chopped mint. Serve with cacik, green salad and freshly
baked bread.
