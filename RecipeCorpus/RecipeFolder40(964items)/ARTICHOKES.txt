Title: ARTICHOKES
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk 10 oz frozen artichoke
Hearts
1/2    Red onion, sliced VERY thin
6    Cloves garlic, whole
Juice of lemon, divided
Fresh rosemary sprig,
Chopped
Put everything (except some reserved lemon juice) in a lidded
casserole. Bake covered for about an hour. Uncover, add reserved
lemon juice, and bake another 5 minutes. You will have a HARD time
believing it's fat free because of what the garlic does - it gets all
gooey!
