Put the meat in a bowl.  Add grated onions and seasoning and mix
well. Make meat balls the size of walnuts. Put water in a 3 qt pot.
Add salt and rice and let cook for 15 minutes.  Add vegetables and
let cook for another 15 minutes.  Cut fresh pomegranate and take out
the seeds to make about 1 1/2 cups.  Add meat balls, pomegranate
seeds, and sugar to the soup and let cook for another 20 minutes on a
low fire or until the meat is done.

Rub dried mint in the palm of your hands to make it powdery. Add
cinnamon and pepper to the mint.  Add this to the soup just before
removing it from the fire.

Taste soup, and if needed add more salt and lime juice for the right
flavoring.  If the pomegranate is sweet it will require lime juice.

This is a popular winter soup.
