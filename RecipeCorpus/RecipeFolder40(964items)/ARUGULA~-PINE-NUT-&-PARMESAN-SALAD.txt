Title: ARUGULA~ PINE NUT & PARMESAN SALAD
Categories: Italian/tus, Salads/dres
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Pine nuts
3 oz Arugula -- stemmed and
Washed
2 oz Parmigiano-reggiano cheese
1 tb Red wine vinegar
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Fine sea salt to taste
1. Preheat the oven to 350#161#.

2.  Spread the nuts loosely on a baking sheet. Toast until lightly
browned, about 10 minutes. Check every few minutes to avoid burning
the nuts. Remove from the oven and turn out onto a large plate to
cool.

3. In a large shallow salad bowl, combine the arugula and toasted pine
nuts. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan cheese into long
thick strips directly into the bowl. Season the salad with fine sea
salt and toss gently to blend.

4. Drizzle 1 tablespoon vinegar over the salad and season with
pepper, and toss to blend. Add just enough oil to very lightly coat
the arugula, and toss to blend. Serve immediately, arranging on large
serving plates.
