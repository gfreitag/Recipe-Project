Categories: Sauces, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2    Diced green pepper
1/2    Diced onion
2    Chopped tomatoes
1/2 c  Red or white wine
1/2 c  Cream or milk
Your favorite spices
-basil, oregano, etc.
Salt & pepper
Heat olive oil in large skillet till water sizzles. Add 1/2 diced
green pepper, 1/2 diced onion, 1 to 2 crushed & diced cloves garlic,
and a couple chopped large tomatoes (peeled if you prefer). You can
also add other veggies if you wish.  After they saute for about 5
minutes, add one cup tomato sauce, 1/2 cup red or white wine (or
stock, or water from the cooking pasta), and 1/2 cup cream (or milk).
Flavor with a sprinkle of oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Turn down
heat and simmer about 5 minutes. Serve over pasta. This sauce is
quite different from the normal cook-all-day sauces; it is more fresh
and vibrant, but not as complex. It will accomodate almost any
vegetable you choose to add. Try eggplant or broccoli or asparagus,
just to name a few.
