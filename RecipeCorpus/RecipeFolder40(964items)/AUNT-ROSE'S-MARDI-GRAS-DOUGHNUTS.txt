Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder together in a bowl. Make a
well in the middle and add the eggs, milk, salt and vanilla. Beat
these together and gradually work on the flour. Roll out on a floured
board to about 1/4 inch or a little thinner if preferred.

Cut the dough into 2 x 4-inch strips and simply make 3 or 4 slits in
the center of each.  Fry in deep oil until golden brown. Sprinkle
with powdered sugar.

HINT:  These will be firmer than doughnuts.

Yield: approximately 18 to 20.
