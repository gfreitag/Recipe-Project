Title: ASPARAGUS & BLUE CHEESE QUICHE
Categories: Starters, Cheese/eggs, Tarts, French, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
8 oz Pastry *
1 oz Blue cheese (good)
1 1/2 oz Cream cheese (Philadelphia)
200 ml Made up to with half & half
3 md Eggs
Salt, pepper & cayenne
8 oz Asparagus; peeled & cooked
NB* As usual, the weight of pastry is the weight of flour used to
make it.

Roll out the pastry and line a 9" flan ring. Bake blind as usual at
a high temperature (400 for 8-9 mins weighted down then a futher 2-3
mins just to colour lightly). Meanwhile, mash the cheeses together,
put into a

measuring jug and make up to volume with cream or cream and milk.
Beat hard with the eggs (food processor). Season to taste with salt,
pepper and cayenne as usual.
The asparagus should have been peeled/trimmed as usual and boiled in
strongly salted water until just tender - for really freshly picked
asparagus <15 minutes will suffice. Immediately remove from water and
separate on a paper towel to cool quickly. When cold, cut into 2"
lengths

and spread out on the flan base. Pour over the custard and bake in a
moderate oven (375F) for around 30 minutes until nicely set. Serve
warm (not cold or too hot).
