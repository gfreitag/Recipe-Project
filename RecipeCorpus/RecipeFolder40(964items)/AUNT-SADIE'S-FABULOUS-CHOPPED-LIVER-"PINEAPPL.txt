I just have to pass this along to you. I don't want you to prepare
this bec none of us need the bad cholesterol ingredients. I just
wanted you to have pleasure of reading it. Saute liver, one chopped
onion, and celery in generous amount of chicken >> fat; cooking until
liver is just done, with no pink showing, but while live are still
soft. Put everything through a meat grinder, adding salt and pepper
to taste. Bl well, adding chicken fat if necessary. Chill well. Cut
the top off the pineapple and reserve top. Mold liver on a large
servi tray, copying the fresh >>>>>> pineapple shape as closely as
possible. Score diamond shapes and press olive slices into each
diamond. Place pineapple top onto top of liver mold. Surround
"Pineapple" with curly lettu buffet rye bread and cherry tomatoes.
