I noticed someone in here was requesting apricot recipes and someone
else is partial to white chocolate, so to kill two birds with one
scone (ga ka ka ka ka) here is a delicious scone recipe from one of
my parents' cookbooks.  They lived in England for three years, where
scones are virtually the staff of life.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, stir together the
flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch
cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry
blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in the butter until
the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, stir together
the cream, egg, and vanilla. Add the cream mixture to the flour
mixture and knead until combined. Knead in the white chocolate,
walnuts, and apricots.

With lightly floured hands, pat the dough out on a floured work
surface to a thickness of 5/8 inch.  Cut circles in the dough with a
biscuit cutter. Gather the scraps of dough together and repeat till
all the dough is used. Bake scones on ungreased baking sheet for 15
to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned on top.  Place baking sheet
on wire rack for 5 minutes, then transfer scones to wire rack to
cool. Serve warm or cool completely and store in an airtight
container.  Makes 8 or 9 scones.

* (Sue speaking) You can use those "Nestles Treasures" white chocolate
chips, but before they came out with those, I used to use a Nestle
Alpine White With Almonds bar, smashed into pieces. I would then omit
the walnuts and substitute half the vanilla extract with almond
extract for a delicious variation.

** To toast walnuts, place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking
sheet and bake at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the sheet a
couple of times, until the nuts are fragrant.
