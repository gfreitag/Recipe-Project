Title: APRICOT BARS
Categories: Bakery, Desserts, Cookies, Low-fat
Yield: 18 Bars
1 c  White flour
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Dried apricots
1 tb Walnuts, chopped
1 tb Cashews, chopped
1/3 c  Maple syrup
MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
1 c  Icing sugar
2 tb Shortening
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 tb Apple juice
Sift together flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder & salt. Stir in
the apricots & nuts.  Add the syrup. Stir until the mixture forms a
thick batter.

Spread the batter into a lightly oiled 8" X 8" baking pan (it is hard
work, but it will cover -- trust me!). Bake at 350F for 30 to 35
minutes or until the bars test done. Allow to cool slightly, cut into
bars. When completely cool, spread with icing & drizzle some melted
chocolate over the top if desired.

ICING: Cream together sugar & shortening.  Add remaining ingredients
& beat until smooth.  Makes 1/2 cup.
