The crisp coating keeps the lamb succulent and juicy. Bake 10 minutes
longer for medium-done. If you use frozen lamb, defrost in the
refrigerator overnight. 1. Combine jam, mustard, garlic, soy sauce,
olive oil and rosemary. Reserve 2 tb of marinade for sauce. Brush
remainder all over lamb. Season well with salt and pepper. 2.
Marinate for 30 minutes. 3. Broil lamb for 3 minutes per side. Then
bake lamb at 425F(220C) fat side up for 20 minutes or until just
pink. Remove from oven and let rest on a serving dish for 10 minutes.
Pour off any fat in pan. 4. Add red wine to pan and reduce to 1 tb.
Add beef broth, reserved marinade and any extra lamb juices from the
serving dish. Bring to boil and hoil for 2 minutes. 5. Slice lamb in
thin slices against the grain. Serve with some sauce poured over.
Serve with a Merlot wine from Ontario Canada, California USA, or St
Emilion. A chianti is another fine match.
