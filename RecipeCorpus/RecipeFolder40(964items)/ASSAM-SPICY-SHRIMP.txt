Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 x  ---------marinating---------
1 1/2 c  Water
2 lb Headless shrimp
1 tb Oyster sauce
1/2 ts Hot chili sauce
6 oz Tamarind
1 x  ----------cooking-----------
3 oz Young ginger root
4 ea Large garlic cloves
1 ts Blachan
2 ea Small red onions
3 tb Oyster sauce
1 tb Dark soya sauce
1 tb Hot chili sauce
3 tb Oil
1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
MARINATING:  Break tamarind apart, place in a small saucepan with
water. Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes or until pasty coating
separates from seeds. Press through a sieve or food mill to extract
all pulp and soupy liquid.  Discard seeds.  Rinse shrimps thoroughly,
pat dry and marinate fro 1 hour with 1 tablespoon of this tamarind
liquid, the oyster sauce and hot chili sauce. COOKING:  Meanwhile,
cut young ginger into toothpick-sized slivers.  If using mature
ginger, peel and sliver. Peel and sliver garlic. Place blachan in a
non-stick pan and heat gently fro 3 to 4 minutes to develop the
flavors.  Pell and cut red onions into wedges. Combine oyster, soy
and chili sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind liquid.
Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop of water sizzles
immediately into steam pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Swirl up
sides of wok, and when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and
garlic. Stir fry until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding more oil
as needed, stir frey shrimp in batches until orange red, about 3
minutes. Pour sauces over all the shrimp in the wok and cook at a
brisk bubble over high heat until shrimps are aromatic and sauces
have reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells, about 8 minutes. Mix
in sugar and onion wedges, taste to adjust seasoning, sweetening and
spiciness.  Makes plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice, enough
for
8    with other dishes.
