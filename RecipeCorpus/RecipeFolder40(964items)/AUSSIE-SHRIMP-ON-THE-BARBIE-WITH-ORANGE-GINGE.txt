Title: AUSSIE SHRIMP ON THE BARBIE WITH ORANGE GINGE
Categories: Australian, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
12    Giant Prawns, shelled and
-deveined (heads and tails
-intact)
1/4 c  Butter
1 c  Orange juice (freshly
-squeezed)
2 tb Sherry
1 ts Orange Zest (grated)
2 ea Green onions, tops and white
-(minced)
1 ts Ginger root (freshly grated)
Soak a dozen long wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Then push
skewers through prawns, lengthwise, from head to tail with only 1 to
a skewer.

Combine all ingredients in saucepan and cook over medium to low heat,
stirring, until butter is completely melted.

Dip skewered prawns in the orange sauce and position on oiled grill
rack about 4 inches above the coals. Baste liberally with sauce and
grill for 2 minutes. Turn the prawn over and baste again, cooking for
another 2 minutes. Smaller prawn will be done at this point, but
continue basting and turning larger prawn until they are pink and
cooked through. Remove from heat immediately when done, as they will
get tough of overcooked. Use any remaining sauce for a dip for the
prawns.
