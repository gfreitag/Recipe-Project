Title: AUSTRIAN GUGELHUPF
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Milk, warm (110 F to 115F)
2    Yeast, active dry packages
4 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 c  Butter or margerine
1/2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
1 c  Light raisins
1/4 c  Currants
2 ts Orange peel, finely shredded
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Almonds, whole blanched
Place warm milk in a medium mixing bowl.  Sprinkle yeast over milk.
Add 1/2 cup flour.  Beat with a large spoon about 1 minute. Cover and
let rise in a warm place until almost double (40 minutes). In a large
mixer bowl beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the
eggs, one at a time, mixing well after adding each. Stir in yeast
mixture, raisins, currants, orange peel and salt.  Gradually stir in
the remaining 3-1/2 cups flour. Lightly grease and flour a 9-cup
gugelhupf mold or 12-cup fluted tube pan. Arange whole almonds in a
design in the bottom of the pan. Carefully spoon batter over almonds.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost double (about 1
hour).  Bake in a 350 F oven about 40 minutes. If necessary cover top
with foil the last 15 minutes of baking time to prevent over
browning.  Remove from pan.  Cool on wire rack. Before serving, sift
powdered sugar over cake.
