Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Jerusalem artichokes
-- thinly sliced
-- (prepared weight given)
Salt
Pepper
Crushed garlic
7 fl Stock
Butter
Cream; hot
Parsley; chopped
Put the sliced artichokes into a well-buttered gratin dish or shallow
flameproof casserole, seasoning with the salt, pepper, and the merest
hint of crushed garlic between layers. Press down firmly, pour on the
stock and dot with butter.  Cook in a moderate oven or over a gentle
flame until the vegetables are tender but not disintegrated and most
of the liquid has been absorbed.  Drizzle on some hot cream and let
it slither down between layers.  Warm through briefly and serve
sprinkled with parsley.
