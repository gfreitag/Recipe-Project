Title: ASIAN MILLET SALAD
Categories: Digest, July
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Cooked millet
6 tb Mirin or dry sherry
1    10-oz  package of tofu,
Diced
3 tb Soy sauce
3/4 c  Chopped snow peas
1 1/2 tb Rice or cider vinegar
3/4 c  Frozen peas, thawed
1    Clove garlic, minced
1    8-oz  can sliced water
Chestnuts
1 ts Sugar (or other sweetener)
1/2 c  Chopped scallion
In a large bowl, combine the millet, tofu, snow peas, peas, water
chestnuts, and scallion.

In a small bowl, stir together the mirin, soy sauce, venegar, garlic,
and sugar.  Pour over the salad and toss to combine.

Although the original recipes didn't say to, I let both of these
salads chill for awhile to let the flavors blend before I served
them. I think that this step is a particularly good idea for the
Asian Millet salad, as it allows the tofu to absorb the flavors of
the dressing. If you try these, I hope you enjoy them as much as I
did!
