Title: Parchment-Wrapped Chicken
Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Appetizer, Chicken
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Sugar
2 ts Oil
24    Squares (6-in) parchment
(see NOTE)
2 c  Oil, for deep-frying
Hoisin sauce, for dipping
4    Scallions, green tops only
2    Whole chicken beast
1 ts Ginger juice (see below)
2 ts Dry sherry or
Shaoshing wine
2 ts Light soy sauce
1 ts Salt
Shred the scallions lengthwise and then cut into 1-1/2 inch lengths.
Cut the chicken breasts into strips 1/4 inch wide by 1-1/2 inches in
length. Squeeze enough fresh ginger in a garlic press to render 1
teaspoon of ginger juice. In a bowl, combine the ginger juice with
the sherry/wine, scallion strips, soy sauce, salt and sugar, to make
a marinade for the chicken strips.  Let the chicken marinate for at
least 10 minutes. Place a square of parchment in front of you, with a
corner toward you. Rub a bit of oil o the center of the paper.  Place
a little of the chicken and a bit of the scallion on the paper
horizontally, well below the center of the angled square.  Fold the
lower corner up to cover the meat, then fold the left corner over to
the right and the right corner over to left, to make a small
envelope. Fold the top corner down and tuck it in securely. Repeat
the process for the other 23 pieces of paper, using the rest of the
chicken and scallions. In wok or deep fryer, heat the oil to 375
degrees F. Deep fry the envelopes in the hot oil for 1 minute on each
side. Remove with a slotted spoon or a strainer, and drain on paper
towels. Serve with hoisin sauce. NOTE: Deep-frying foods in a
wrapping of paper is a Chinese trick. The paper
acts like a batter coating, to protect and insulate the
ingredient
against the hot oil.
Use cooking parchment or rice paper; other suitable papers are
available in cooking-supply houses.  The paper must be porous;
never
use aluminum foil or plastic cling wrap. -- Verdi
