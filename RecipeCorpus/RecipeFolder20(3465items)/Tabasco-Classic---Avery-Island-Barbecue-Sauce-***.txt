~-- In a heavy nonaluminum saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter
and saute the onion, celery, pepper, and garlic for 5 minutes, or
until the onion is tender but not browned.  Add the remaining
ingredients.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, until the sauce
thickens, stirring occasionally. Discard the lemon slices and bay
leaf.  Brush the sauce on chicken, ribs, frankfurters, or hamburgers
during grilling, broiling, or baking. Makes 2-1/4 cup.
