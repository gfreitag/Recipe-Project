Title: Sliced Kiwi and Banana with Strawberry Puree
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
1 T  Cornstarch
6 ea Kiwis
3 ea Bananas
1 pt Strawberries, hulled
1 ea Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 x  Water
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
Place strawberries in blender with lemon juice and 1/4 cup water.
(Thawed unsweeted strawberries could be substituted). Blend until
smooth. Press through fine strainer into medium-sized saucepan.
(Sauce foams as it cooks, so you will need the extra space).  Add
sugar to mixture; bring to a boil. Lower heat; simmer 5 minutes. Mix
cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water; stir into mixture 1 to 2 minutes
or until thickened.
Remove from heat.  Cool and chill. Just before serving, peel kiwis
and bananas.  Place several tablespoons for strawberry mixture in
corner of each dessert plate.  Slice 1 kiwi and half a banana into
overlapping semicircles around each pool of sauce. (If you have any
strawberry mixture left over, it's delicious on ice cream).
