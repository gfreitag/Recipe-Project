Title: Potted Meat
Categories: Penndutch, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Salt & pepper
1 x  Mustard
1 x  Meat
1 x  Cayenne
1 x  Butter, melted
Chop and pound to a paste any fragments of cooked ham, tongue,
poultry, game or fish. With ham use a quarter part of fat. Remove all
gristle and skin and pound until free from any fibre and reduced to a
paste. Season highly with salt, pepper, cayenne, and made mustard,
and moisten with a little melted butter (except ham, which has fat
enough).
Pack closely in small stone or earthen jars. Put jars in steamer and
heat for one half hour. Then press the meat down again and cover with
hot melted butter. This will keep some time and may be served in
slices or used for sandwiches. Ham and tongue may be mixed with veal
or chicken. Beef, game and fish are better alone.
