Heat the oil in a large pot over a medium-high flame.
When hot, put in the  peppercorns,  cloves,  bay leaves, and
cardamom pods.   Stir for a second.  Now put in the onions, garlic
and ginger. Stir and fry until the onions develop brown specks. Now
add the meat, ground cumin, ground coriander,  cayenne pepper,
and 1q/2 of the salt.   Stir and fry for  a minute.
Add  1 tablespoon of the yogurt.   Stir and fry for a minute. Keep
doing this until all yogurt has been incorporated. The meat should
also have a slightly browned look. Add the spinach and the remaining
salt. Stir to mix. Keep stirring and cooking until the spinach wilts
completely. Cover tightly and simmer on low heat for about 1 hour or
until meat is tender. Remove the lid and add the garam masala.  Turn
the heat to medium. Stir and cook another  5
minutes until most of the water  in  the  spinach disappears and you
have a thick,  green sauce.
Remove the whole spices and serve.
