Prepare tomato sauce; keep warm. Cut as small a slit as possible in
one side of each chile to remove seeds. Leave stems on. Pat chiles
dry with paper towels. Cut cheese into 6 long thin sticks. Place 1
stick in each chile, using more if chiles are large. If chiles are
loose and open, wrap around cheese and fasten with wooden picks. Pour
oil 1/4" deep into large skillet. Heat oil to 365 deg. f. Beat egg
whites in a medium bowl until stiff. Beat egg yolks lightly in a
small bowl and add all at once to beaten egg whites. Fold lightly but
thoroughly. Roll chiles in flour, then dip in egg mixture to coat.
Fry in hot oil until golden brown, turning with a spatula. Drain on
paper towels. Serve immediately topped with tomato sauce.
