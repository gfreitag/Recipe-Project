Yield: 1 servings
4 ea Egg
1/2 t  Cinnamon
1 c  Whiskey
1/3 c  Cream
2 c  Pumpkin, cooked
1 c  Sugar
1 T  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Butter

Take a large pumpkin, wash, cut in half and place, cut side down, in
pan in warm oven. Roast until soft, but not mushy. Scrape out the
flesh of the pumpkin with a spoon or fork. Place into colander and
let drain over night in a cool place. The next morning, put 2 cups of
the pumpkin in a bowl and whip thoroughly with a fork until all lumps
disappear, but avoid mashing. Drain out as much liquid as possible,
because the pumpkin should be dry. Add the sugar, yolks of eggs,
cinnamon and beat for 5 minutes. Quickly add the cream, the whiskey
and the butter, and mix well. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the
stiffly beaten whites of eggs and add to the first mixture. Pour into
a pan about 2 1/2 inches deep which has been lined with pie pastry,
and bake for one hour at 375-F. Allow pie to become cold before using.
