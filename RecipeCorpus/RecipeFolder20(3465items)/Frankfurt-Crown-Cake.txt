++++++++++++++ ++++ CAKE: To prepare cake, cream butter and sugar
until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in egg yolks, one
at a time. Mix in lemon rind and 2 T rum.  Sift baking powder and
flour together. Gently mix into the butter mixture.  Beat egg whites
until stiff but not dry. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.
Pour into a well-greased 10-inch tube pan. Bake in a preheated 325
degree F. oven for about 60 minutes or until the cake tests done.
Cool cake in pan for 10 minutes adn then turn out on wire rack to
cool completely. Slice cake crosswise into 3 layers. Pour about 2 T
of rum over each layer. Butter-Cream Filling: For butter-cream
filling, boil sugar and water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage).
Beat egg yolks until very light and fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes. While
still beating the egg yolks, add the sugar syrup in a thin stream.
Beat 5 minutes more, until very thick and doupled in bulk.
Slowly beat in the rum.  Beat the butter in a small bowl until soft
and light.  Beat butter into the egg mixture a little at a time.
Continue beating until thick. Chill until mixture can be spread. If
mixture is too soft, beat in additional butter. PRALINE TOPPING:
While butter-cream is cooking, spread 2 T butter thickly in a 9 X
13-inch baking pan for praline topping.  Then in a 1-quart saucepan,
boil sugar an water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage).  Stir in
almonds; cook until mixture reaches 310 degrees F. or until syrup
carmelizes. Pour syrup into prepared baking pan. When cool, break up
praline and grind it in a blender for a few seconds. APRICOT GLAZE:
Finally heat jam and press through a strainer or sieve to make
apricot glaze. CAKE ASSEMBLY: To assemble cake, place bottom layer of
cake on cake plate and spread with half of the butter cream. Repeat
with second layer.
Place third layer on top.  Spread top and sides of cake with apricot
glaze.  Press praline powder onto glaze. Any remianing butter cream
can be used to decorate the top of the cake.
