Gumbo is one of those dishes which don't really suffer if an
ingredient is added or subtracted--so feel free to modify. This
specifies andouille (Cajun) sausage, but you could substitute
kielbasa or even pepperoni.

IN A LARGE POT, saute the sausage until well-browned. Remove from the
pot. Add half the oil to the pot and add the okra. Cook until soft,
about 15 minutes. Add the rest of the oil, the onion, green pepper
and garlic, and cook 10 minutes more. Add the stock, tomato and
spices. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Add the shrimp and scallops
and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the crab meat and parsley, simmer
2-to-3 minutes and serve.
