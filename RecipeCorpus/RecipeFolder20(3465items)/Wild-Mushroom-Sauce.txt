Title: Wild Mushroom Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Meat, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Finely minced shallots
-=OR=- Onions
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sherry or Madeira
1/2 c  Whipping cream
4 oz Dried mushrooms
12 oz Assorted fresh mushrooms
- (chanterelle, cultivated,
- shiitake, oyster)
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Finely minced garlic
This sauce has an intensely woodsy flavor that would be good on pasta,
roast chicken or pork.

TO RECONSTITUTE DRIED MUSHROOMS, place them in a bowl and cover with
3 cups of warm water. Soak for at least 2 hours or up to 8. When
mushrooms are soft, drain and reserve water and squeeze out as much
water as you can from the mushrooms. Pour the mushroom water through
a double layer of cheesecloth or a cloth towel to remove any sand
that may have been lurking in the mushrooms. Reserve 1 cup of liquid
for this recipe. (Pour the remaining mushroom water into a plastic
container or airtight bag, label and freeze for up to a year to use
in soups and sauces.) Wash the fresh mushrooms and pat dry. (Slice
chanterelles and cultivated mushrooms, trim and discard the stems of
shiitake mushrooms, and trim and discard root tips of oyster
mushrooms.) Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat and
add the reconstituted dried mushrooms, garlic, shallots and salt.
Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes. Add the fresh mushrooms and continue
to cook another 10 minutes. Add the reserved mushroom water and
sherry. Increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid reduces
by about 2/3. Add the cream and cook until the liquid reduces to a
saucelike consistency and is thick enough to coat a spoon.
