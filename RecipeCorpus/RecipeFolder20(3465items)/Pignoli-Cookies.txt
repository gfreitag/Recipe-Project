Title: Pignoli Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains, Italian
Yield: 36 servings
2 c  Flour, or a little less
-(See NOTE)
1 c  Pine nuts, chopped
Granulated sugar
Sweetened milk, optional
1 1/4 lb Almonds; ground fine
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Salt
CREAM BUTTER AND SUGAR together until very soft. Then carefully blend
in the ground almonds, salt, vanilla and flour. The dough will be
rather firm. Cut off pieces about the size of prunes and roll them
into little cigar-shaped pieces about 1/2-inch thick. Roll these in
the chopped pine nuts and bend them into a half-moon shape. Place
these 1-inch apart on greased baking pans. Bake at 350F for 15-to-20
minutes. The crescents should not be browned. Cool about 5 minutes,
then strew with a little granulated sugar or brush with heavily
sweetened milk.

NOTE: For reasons never adequately explained, cake and other baked
foods need more flour on some days than on others.
