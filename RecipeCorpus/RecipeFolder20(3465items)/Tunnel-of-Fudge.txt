1 1/2 c  Butter
6 ea Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sifted flour

light and fluffy.  By nad, stir in flour, dry frosting mix, and
wlanuts until well blended.  Bake in greased and floured 12 cup bundt

Since the cake has the soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary doneness tests
can not be used.  Test after 60 minutes by observing a dry, shiny
brownie-type crust.  Cool 30 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack or
serving plate. Cake will have a moist center called the Tunnel of
Fudge.
