MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
1 x  Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef
1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note
1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)
NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut
these into strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips
that have skin on one surface. Cut carrots and onions into similar
strips.
In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork.
Mix in the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed. Set
aside. In a 1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the butter,
the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco and
meat seasoning mix. Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring
frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and
cool. Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk to
the meat and mix well by hand.
Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and center in the pan.
Bake at 450F until brown on top, about 30 minutes.
Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons. Set
meat and drippings aside.
Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork tender; drain, reserving
about 1 cup of the water.  Place the potatoes, while still hot, in a
large mixing bowl with the remaining 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup milk,
the salt and white pepper.  Stir with a wooden spoon until broken up,
then beat with a metal whisk (or electric mixer with a paddle) until
creamy and velvety smooth.
(NOTE: Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not
creamy enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine
the reserved drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable
seasoning mix; saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add the zucchini and yellow squash and continue sauteing
until vegetables are noticeably brighter in color, about 3 to 4
minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.
Mound undrained vegetables on top of the meat loaf, away from the
edges. Layer the mashed potatoes evenly over the top of the
vegetables and top edges of the meat, using all the potatoes. Bake at
525F until brown on top, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve immediately
with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun Sauce (see recipe) under each
serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana Kitchen"
