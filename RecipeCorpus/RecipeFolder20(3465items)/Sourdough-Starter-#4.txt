Title: Sourdough Starter #4
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Potato Water
1 x  Unbleached Flour
Boil some potatoes for supper, save the potato water, and use it
lukewarm with enough unbleached flour to make a thick batter. without
yeast. This is a good way to make it in camp, where you have no yeast
available and want fast results.  This is also the way most farm
girls made it in the olden days.  Let stand a day or so, or until it
smells right.
