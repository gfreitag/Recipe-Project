Fill machine with cold water up to water level for desired number of
cups. Do not cover safety valve hole with water. Fill brew basket to
rim with coffee. For 9 cups, remove the reducer from the brew basket
and fill entire basket. For 3 or 6 cups, use the reducer as follows:
long stem facing down for 3 cups; short stem facing down for 6 cups.
Clean off excess grounds from brew basket rim and o-ring.
Close and tighten down knob as far as possible. Close steam valve.
Place machine on high heat and put a carafe under valve to catch
coffee.
Coffee will begin to drip out slowly after 3-10 minutes, and appear
very dark. As brewing process continues, stream will become strong
and steady, and coffee will lighten. When coffee stops and becomes
noisy, close coffee valve and remove carafe.
If you are making cappuccino, close valve and let steam build up. Put
cream or milk in cup and open steam valve to froth.
