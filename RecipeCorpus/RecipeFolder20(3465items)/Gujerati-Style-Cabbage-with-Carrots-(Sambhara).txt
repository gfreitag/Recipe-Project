Categories: Asian, Side dish, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
1 ea Hot dried red chili
13/16 t  Salt
1/3 t  Sugar
2 2/3 T  Chopped fresh coriander
2/3 t  Lemon juice
1/2 lb Cabbage
1/2 lb Carrots
1/2 ea Fresh hot green chili
2 2/3 T  Vegetable oil
1 pn Asafetida
2/3 T  Whole black mustard seed
Core  the cabbage and cut it into fine,  long shreds.
Peel the carrots and grate them coarsely.  Cut the green chili into
thin, long strips. Heat  the  oil in a wide, casserole-type pot over a
medium-high  flame. When hot, put in the asafetida. A second later,
put in the  mustard seeds.   As soon as the mustard seeds begin to
pop, put in the dried red chili.   Stir once. The chili should turn
dark red in seconds.  Now put in the cabbage, carrots and green
chili. Turn the heat down to medium and stir the vegetables around
for half a minute. Add the salt,  sugar and green coriander. Stir and
cook for another 5 minutes or until  the vegetables  are  just done
and retain some of their crispness. Ad  the lemon juice.   Stir to
mix. (Remove the whole red chili before serving to those unfamiliar
with Indian foods.)
