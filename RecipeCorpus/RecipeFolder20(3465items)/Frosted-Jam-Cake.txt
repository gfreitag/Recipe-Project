This recipe comes from the Silver Leaf 1815 Inn in Lyles, Tenn.

Preheat the oven to 350 degree F., then grease and flour 3 9-inch cake
pans.

Cream the butter and sugar until light then beat in the eggs and jam,
blending well.  Sift the dry ingredients together and then add the dry
ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk, to the creamed mixture,
blending well after each addition.  Stir in the raisins and nuts.
Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans and bake for 35 to 45
minutes, or until the cake tests done, in the preheated oven. Cool
for 5 minutes on wire racks and turn out of the cake pans to cool to
room temperature. When cool, spread with the warm frosting,
