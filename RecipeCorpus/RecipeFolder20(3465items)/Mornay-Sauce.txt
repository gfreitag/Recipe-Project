Title: Mornay Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
Pepper
Nutmeg
1/2 c  Grated Gruyere cheese
2 tb Butter
3 tb Flour
1 c  Milk; hot
Salt
Pour this over any cooked vegetable and run it under the broiler to
brown for an easy gratin.

IN SEPARATE SAUCEPANS, heat the milk and melt the butter. Add the
flour to the melted butter and slowly stir over low heat with a
wooden spoon to mix together. Continue cooking for 2-to-3
minutes--let the mixture color but not brown. Add the milk and bring
the mixture to a boil, stirring to beat out the lumps. Boil for at
least 2 minutes. Season to taste, then add the cheese. If the mixture
isn't spreadable when warm, thin it by adding more milk--a tablespoon
at a time.

Makes 1 1/4 Cups
