Title: Southern Biscuit Muffins
Categories: Cajun/creol, Bread, Muffin
Yield: 12 servings
1/4 t  Sa;t
1/4 lb Plus 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 c  Cold milk
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 T  Baking powder
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt; mix well,
breaking up any lumps.  Work the butter in by hand until the mixture
resembles coarse cornmeal, making sure no lumps are left. Gradually
stir in the milk, mixing just until dry ingredients are moistened. DO
NOT OVERBEAT. Spoon the batter into 12 greased muffin cups. Bake at
350F until golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes.  The finished
muffins should have a thick crust with a cakelike centre. From Paul
