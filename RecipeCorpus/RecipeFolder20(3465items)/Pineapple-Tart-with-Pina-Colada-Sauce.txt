Title: Pineapple Tart with Pina Colada Sauce
Categories: Dessert, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 10 servings
4    Puff pastry shells
2    Pineapples,med,peeled
Mint sprigs (opt)
STRAWBERRY SAUCE
1/2 c  Sugar
4    Large egg yolks
3/4 c  Canned coconut milk
1 tb Rum (opt)
All-purpose flour
1. In a 1 1/2 to 2 quart pan, mix 1/3 cup sugar, yolks, and 3/4 cup
coconut milk. Stir over medium-low heat until mixture thickly coats a
metal spoon, about 10 minutes; do not boil. Stir in rum. Let cool. If
made ahead, chill airtight up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature;
stir. If sauce is too thick to pour, thin with a little coconut milk.

2. On a lightly floured board, roll each pastry shell into a 8"
round; trim edges to neaten. Set rounds slightly apart on 2 baking
sheets, each 12x15" Bake in a 400'F. oven until golden and crisp,
10-15 minues (in 1 oven, switch pans halfway through baking). Cool
pastries on racks. If made ahead, store airtight up to 1 day.

3. Halve pineapples lengthwise; core. Slice crosswise 1/4" thick.
Place 1/2 the pineapple on each baking sheet. Place 1 pan about 3"
below broiler. When tinged brown, about 10 minues, turn pineapple
over and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Broil until brown, about 6
minutes. Repeat to broil remaining fruit. If made ahead, let stand up
to 2 hours.

4. To present, put 1/2 or 1 pastry (break large bubbles to flatten)
on each dinner plate. Fan pineapple equally on pastries; pour coconut
sauce around desserts. Spoon dots of strawberry sauce onto coconut
sauce. Garnish with mint.
