Dry veal on paper towels.  Roll in a mixture of salt, sugar, white
pepper, and mustard.  Place a bacon slice on top of each piece of
veal. Place an unsliced egg on top of the bacon. Rollup each slice of
veal (jelly-roll fashion) and tie together with string.
Heat oil in frypan and brown veal rolls well on all sides. Add onion;
saute for 3 minutes.  Add the hot bouillon; cover and simmer gently 25
minutes.  Remove the veal from the pan. Remove the strings from the
veal and keep veal warm on a serving platter.  Add tomato paste to
the pan drippings; stir.  Thoroughly mix flour and red wine to remove
all lumps. Add to sauce and cook until mixture thickens. Add warm
veal rolls and heat through.  Before serving, place veal rolls on a
platter, pour sauce over the rolls and serve with pureed potatoes.
