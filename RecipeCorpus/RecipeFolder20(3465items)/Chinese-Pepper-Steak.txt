Categories: Beef, Chinese, Beverage
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Thinly Sliced Onion
1/2 c  Coca-Cola
2 md Ripe Tomatoes
2 1/2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Coca-Cola
1 tb Soy Sauce

2 tb Vegetable Oil
1    Clove Garlic, Minced
1 ts Salt
1 c  Beef Broth

Trim all fat from the meat and cut into pencil thin strips.  In a deep
skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil, garlic and salt.  Add the meat and
brown over high heat, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a
fork.  Add the beef broth.  Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or
until the meat is fork-tender.  Stir in the green pepper strips,
celery, onions and 1/2 cup Coca-Cola.  Cover and simmer for 5
minutes.  Do not overcook; the vegetables should be crisp-tender.
Peel the tomatoes; cut into wedges and gently stir into meat mixture.
Blend cornstarch with 1/4 cup of Coca-Cola and the soy sauce.  Stir
into the meat mixture until the sauce thickens, about 1 minute,
stirring lightly with a fork.  Serve over hot rice.  From:
