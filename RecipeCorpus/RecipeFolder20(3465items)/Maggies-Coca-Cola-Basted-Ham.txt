++++++++++++++++++ Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Place ham, fat side down, in a shallow baking pan.
Pour coke into pan until it is 1/2-inch deep.  Bake 2 to 3 hours, or
until ham can be easily pierced with a fork, basting with the
Coca-Cola every 15 to 20 minutes. (Center of ham will read 140
degrees F on a meat thermometer when properly cooked.)  Remove ham
from the pan and cool. Cut away rind and fat with a sharp knife.
Combine sugar, mustards, bread crumbs, and enough Coke to form a
thick paste.  Place ham on roasting rack in pan and pat all over with
the paste.
Add remaining coke to the bottom of the pan.
Increase the temperature to 375 degrees F. and bake the ham 45
minutes longer, basting every 20 to 15 minutes until sugar-mustard
paste has melted to a dark glaze. Let stand at room temperature 30
minutes before slicing.
