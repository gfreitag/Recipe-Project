Categories: Fruit, Beef, Meat, Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Raisins
1 x  Salt
4 tb Brown Sugar; Packed
2 tb Margarine Or Butter; Melted
2 ea Acorn Squash; Md
1 lb Lean Ground Beef
1 1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Cinnamon
2 c  Apples; Pared & Chopped,2 Lg
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Cut each of the squash in half and
remove the seeds and fibers.  Place the squash, cut sides down, in an
ungreased baking pan. Then add water to the depth of 1/4-inch and
bake, uncovered, until the squash is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.
While the squash is baking, cook and stir the meat in a large skillet
until it is brown. Drain off the excess fat.  Remove the skillet from
the heat and stir in the 1 1/2 ts of salt as well as the cinnamon,
the coarsely chopped tart apples and the raisins. When the squash is
cooked, turn them so that the cut side is up and remove them to a
platter.
Drain off any remaining liquid in the pan and dry.
Scoop out the pulp from the acorn squash, making a shell that is
1/4-inch thick all the way around.
Season the shells with salt to taste.  Mash the pulp and mix in the
meat mixture. Return to the shells, piling them full and sprinkle
with 1 tb of brown sugar on each. Drizzle with the melted butter.
Bake uncovered until the apple is tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.
Serve hot. NOTE: You can substitute a combination of 1/2 lb lean
ground beef and 1/2 lb of bulk pork sausage for the 1 lb of lean
ground beef.
