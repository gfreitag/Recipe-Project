Title: Phoenix-Tailed Shrimp
Categories: Seafood, Chinese
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Water, cold
2 c  Oil, for deep-frying
6 tb Salt, coarse
1/2 ts Black peppercorns
2 tb Szechuan  peppercorns
1 lb (medium) fresh shrimp
1 tb Vodka
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts White pepper
1 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
Carefully remove the shells from the shrimp, leaving the tail sections
intact. Devein and wash under cold running water; pat dry with paper
towels.  In a dish or bowl, marinate briefly in a mixture of the
vodka, salt, and pepper while you make the batter.

In a mixing, put the flour and baking powder; gradually add the cold
water, whisking until smooth.

In a wok, heat the 2 cup of oil until it reaches 350 degrees F.  Add 1
tablespoon of the hot oil to the batter and stir to combine.  Take a
shrimp by the tail and dip it into the batter (do not dip the tail),
then slide it into the hot oil. Deep-fry all the shrimp, a few at a
time, until golden brown. This should take about 2 minutes for each
batch. Drain on paper towels, and serve tails up, in a serving dish,
with the salt/pepper mixture for dipping. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer
servings.

FOR DIPPING:  In a bowl, combine coarse salt and the peppercorns.  In
a dry frying pan over high heat, brown the salt/pepper mixture.  When
browned remove and run the mixture through a grinder.
