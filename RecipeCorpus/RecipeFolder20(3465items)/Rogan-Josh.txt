Categories: Asian, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
2 ea Medium onions
1 t  Ground coriander
2 t  Ground black cumin
4 t  Red paprika
1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
1 1/4 t  Salt
6 T  Plain yogurt
1/4 t  Garam masala
1 x  Black pepper
2 ea 1" cubes of ginger chopped
8 ea Cloves of garlic
1 1/2 c  Beef broth
10 T  Vegetable oil
2 lb Lamb or beef stew meat
10 ea Whole black cardamoms
2 ea Bay leaves
6 ea Whole cloves
10 ea Whole peppercorns
1 ea 1" stick cinnamon
Put the ginger,  garlic, and 4 tablespoons water in blender. Blend
well until you have a smooth paste. Heat the oil in a wok to medium
high heat. Brown the meat cubes in several batches and set to one
side. Put the cardamom,  bay  leaves, cloves,
peppercorns, and cinnamon into the same hot oil.
Stir once and wait  until the cloves swell and the bay leaves begin
to take on  color. Now  put in the onions. Stir and fry for about 5
minutes or until
the onions  turn a medium brown color.  Put in the ginger garlic
paste and stir for 30 seconds.   Add the fried meat cubes and juices.
Stir for 30 seconds.
Now put in 1/6 of the yoghurt.   Stir and fry for 30 seconds or
until the yoghurt is well  blended.
Add  the  remaining yoghurt,  a  tablespoon at a time, in the same
way. Stir and fry  for another 3-4 minutes. Now add the rest of the
broth (a little more for beef than lamb). Bring the contents of the
pot to a boil, scraping in all browned spices on the sides and bottom
of the pot. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for about an hour if
lamb and two if beef. Every 10 minutes or so, give the meat a good
stir. When the meat is tender, take off the lid, turn the heat up to
medium and boil away some of the liquid.   You should end up with a
tender meat in a thick, reddish brown sauce.   All the fat  that
collects in the pot may be spooned off the top.
Sprinkle  the  garam masala and black pepper over the meat before
you serve and mix them in.
