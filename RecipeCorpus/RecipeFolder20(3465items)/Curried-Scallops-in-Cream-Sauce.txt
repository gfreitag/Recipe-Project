Drain and return to pan. Mash with 1 tablespoon of butter. Season
with salt and pepper. Beat well; cool slightly. Transfer to a large
pastry bag.

Preheat broiler. Pipe potato around edges of 4 ceramic scallop
dishes. Melt remaining butter in a saucepan. Add mushrooms, shallots
and Curry Powder and cook 2 minutes. Stir in flour and cook 1 minute.
Add reserved liquid and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 2
minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in scallops,
cream, parsley, salt and pepper. Spoon into dishes. Broil 4-5 minutes
or until lightly golden. Garnish with bay leaves, citrus twists and
dill sprigs, if desired, and serve hot.
