Title: Maple Oatmeal Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 2 servings
2 t  Salt
2 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1 tb Quick Rise Instant Yeast
1 ea Egg, beaten
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 c  Regular Rolled Oats
3 tb Butter, cut into bits
1 c  Boiling Water
1 c  Scalded Milk
1/3 c  Maple Syrup
in a large mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats and butter. Pour
boiling water over and stir until butter melts. Add scalded milk,
maple syrup and salt. Let mixture cool slightly until warm to the
touch (if using a thermometer, temperature should read 125 - 130
degrees). Stir in whole-wheat flour, yeast and egg; beat vigorously
with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to
make a stiff dough. Turn out on floured board and knead, sprinkling
surface with additional flour to prevent dough from sticking, until
smooth and elastic, about 8 - 10 minutes. Shape into a ball and place
a lightly buttered bowl; turn to coat dough on all sides with butter.
Cover with a clean dry towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Punch down
dough and divide in half. Shape into loaves and place in 2 greased 8
1/2 by 4 1/2 inch loaf pans. Brush tops of loaves with melted butter.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk -- about 35 -
45 minutes. Bake in an oven preheated to 375 degrees for 35 - 40
minutes or until done. Turn loaves out of pans and let cool on racks.
Makes 2 loaves. From The Gazette, 91/02/27.
