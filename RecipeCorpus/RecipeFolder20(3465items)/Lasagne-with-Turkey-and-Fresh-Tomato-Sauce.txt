To make sauce, core tomatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes.  Put
tomatoes in food processor and blend until coarsely chopped.  (There
should be about 4 cups.)
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in skillet; add 2 tablespoons garlic.  Cook
briefly but do not brown.  Add tomatoes, red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon
fresh oregano and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil and
simmer 10 minutes.
To prepare lasagne, heat 2 tablespoons oil in non-stick skillet;
add turkey.  Cook, stirring to break up meat, until lightly browned.
Add 1 teaspoon garlic, stir; add wine.  Bring to a boil over high
heat and cook until wine evaporates.  Add tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon
oregano and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil and simmer 5
minutes.
Meanwhile, cook lasagne in salted water, according to instructions
on package, adding lasagne strips one at a time.  Cook until tender.
Add cold water to cool.  Drain, and spread strips one at a time on a
damp cloth.
Lightly grease a 2-quart oblong baking dish.  Add a layer of
lasagne.
Beat ricotta with hot water to make it spreadable.  Spread about
1/3 of ricotta over lasagne.  Spread a layer of meat sauce over
ricotta and sprinkle about 1/4 of Parmesan cheese over top.
Continue making layers, ending with a layer of lasagne.  Sprinkle
with remaining Permesan cheese.  Pour melted butter over all.
Bake in preheated 400-degree oven 15 minutes or until lasagne is
piping hot and bubbling.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
