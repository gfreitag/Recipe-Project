Categories: Pork, Fruit, Herbs/spice, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
1 t  Grated Lemon Rind
2 tb Fresh Chopped Parsley
1/2 t  Dried Basil
1/4 t  Dried Thyme
1/4 t  Dried Oregano
1 lb Thin Pork Scallops
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 x  Salt
1 x  Freshly Ground Black Pepper
2 tb Olive Oil
1/2 c  White Wine
* Instead of using white wine, you can use vermouth or chicken stock.
Dredge the pork scallops in flour seasoned with salt and pepper.
Shake off excess. In a large heavy frypan, heat oil over medium-high
heat and cook the pork scallops in batches until browned on both
sides. Remove to a plate and keep warm. Add wine, vermouth or chicken
stock to frypan and cook over high heat, scraping up the brown bits
from bottom, until reduced by about half. Add lemon juice, rind,
parsley, basil, thyme and oregano. Return pork scallops to frypan,
turning occasionally, until well coated in the sauce and heated
through. Serve with noodles and a green steamed vegetable. Serves 4.
