ground; however I think a substitution of pre ground turkey would be
acceptable

To quote the author,"This delightful Passover dish must have been
brought to Italy by the Spanish refugees nearly five hundred years
ago, since its name and preparation are close to the Picadillo of
Spain and south America which is usually made with beef."

Break matzot directly into a shallow bowl and pour broth over them.
In a large saucepan, place meat and oil and season with salt, pepper
and nutmeg. Add bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary and saute,
stirring frequently until meat is dark brown on all sides. (If dried
sage is used, enclose it in the cheesecloth with the rosemary.If you
using ground turkey, add garlic and bay leaf to this cheesecloth
bundle). Transfer meat to a dish to cool.

Remove and discard bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary. Add nuts to
saucepan with oil and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain excess liquid
from the matzot, but do not squeeze dry. Add soaked matzot to the
saucepan and turn heat off. If using cubed turkey breast, grind it
now and return to the saucepan. Add beaten eggs and mix thoroughly.
Oil a 9 inch cake pan and sprinkle with matza meal. Pour meat mixture
into it; level it with a spatula. With a small ladle, make three
depressions near the centre and place 1 egg yolk in each depression.
Bake in 375F oven for 1/2 hour.
