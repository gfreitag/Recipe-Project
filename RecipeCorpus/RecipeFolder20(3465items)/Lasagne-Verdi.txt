Green Lasagna To quote the author, "Many years ago, I invited some
friends to try mu kosher green lasagne. At first they declined my
invitation (being strictly orthodox, they seldom accepted invitations
to eat in other people's homes). But when I insisted that I would buy
everything new -from pots and pans to tablecloth and dishes - they
accepted. They came early, so I prepared everything with their help.
We had a lot of fun, and they liked my lasagna so much that they
asked to stay for supper to eat the leftovers. Of course, I was very
flattered and delighted that they stayed."

Squeeze most of the liquid of the spinach. Chop very fine to the
consistency of a smooth paste.  Make dough with spinach, eggs and
flour as needed, following the directions for pasta - homemade. Roll
it thin, sprinkling often with flour to avoid sticking . Cut into
strips about 5X8 inches. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil with 3
Tbsp salt. Cook a few strips at a time for 2 minutes, uncovered.
Remove from boiling water with a slotted spoon and drop into a basin
of cold water. Drain and spread over a slightly damp cloth. Coat the
bottom of a lasagna baking dish with 2 Tbsp oil and 1/4 cup tomato
sauce. Place in it one layer; lightly cover it with tomato sauce and
dollops of cheese sauce. Sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese and
continue to make layers until you have used up all the pasta and the
sauces. Sprinkle top with remaining oil and bake in a 400F oven for
approximately 20 minutes. Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese in a
separate dish. SERVES: 6
