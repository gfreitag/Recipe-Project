Mateo Times 1/90 The recipe for green curry paste follows. You can
make it as hot as you like by altering the amount of peppers used.
THAI GREEN CURRY CHICKEN WITH BASIL Tiny pea-size Thai green
eggplants are cooked with this curry. You may substitute fresh garden
peas which satisfies the visual appearance.

Allow the coconut milk to stand for one hour or until it separates.
Skim about 1 cup thick coconut cream off the top.

Put coconut cream, galangal and fish sauce into a wok or saucepan.
Cook, stirring over high heat until it becomes thick and oily. Add
green curry paste and cook until it becomes aromatic, about 2 minutes.

Add chicken; cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add remaining 2 cups of coconut milk, citrus leaves, 1/2
cup of the basil, chilies and peas. Bring to a boil, stirring
frequently, and simmer 5 minutes.

Thin sauce with chicken stock or water. Garnish with remaining basil
leaves. Serve hot with rice.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
