Categories: Dessert
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Raisins or dates, chopped
1 c  Pecans, chopped
1 c  Blackberry jam (seedless if
-ossible)
Icing:
3 c  Light brown sugar
1 c  Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1 c  Unsalted butter
2 c  Sugar
5 lg Eggs, beaten
3 c  Flour plus 1 tbsp
1 1/2 ts Allspice
1 1/2 ts Cloves, ground
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Buttermilk
In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream together the butter and
sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.  Add the eggs and
combine well.

Into a bowl, sift together 3 cups of flour, allspice, cloves,
cinnamon, and salt.  In another bowl, combine the buttermilk and
baking soda. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in batches
alternating with the buttermilk mixture.  Beat well after each
addition.

In a bowl, toss together the raisins, pecans, and 1 Tbsp flour.  Stir
the mixture into the batter with the jam, stirring until well
combined.

Line the bottoms of 2 buttered 9-inch cake pans with wax paper and
butter the paper.  Pour the batter into the pans and bake in the
middle of a preheated 325f oven for 40 minutes or until a tester
comes out clean. Let layers cool in the pans on a rack for 15
minutes, invert them onto the rack and let cool completely.

In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, evap. milk, and butter. Cook
the mixture over mod-low heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.
Continue to cook, undisturbed, washing down any sugar crystals that
form on the side of the pan, with a brush dipped in cold water, until
it registers 238f on a candy thermometer.  Transfer the mixture to a
bowl, and beat until it is at spreading consistency. If the icing
gets too thick, dip the icing spatula in hot water.

Transfer one layer, bottom up to a cake plate.  Frost top with the
icing and top it with the other layer, bottom side down.  Frost the
top and sides with remaining icing.
