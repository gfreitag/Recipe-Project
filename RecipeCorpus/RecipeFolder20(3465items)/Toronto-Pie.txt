"The Home Cook Book , published in Toronto in 1879, included a recipe
for Toronto pie. Although continuing as a family favorite, the name
slipped into disuse during the intervening years. A delicate,
hot-milk sponge cake split and filled with raspberry jam, Toronto Pie
belongs in the same family as Boston cream pie." During my 30+ years
living in Toronto, I have never heard of this cake.

Grease a 9 inch round layer cake pan and line with wax paper. Combine
scalded milk and butter.

Sift or blend together flour, baking powder and salt. Beat 2 eggs
until very light and fluffy. Gradually beat in granulated sugar and
vanilla.

With mixer at high speed beat eggs and sugar for 1 minute. Fold in dry
ingredients and then stir in hot milk mixture. Turn into prepared
pan. Bake in preheated 350F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until cake
springs back when lightly touched.

Cool in pan. When almost cool, loosen edges and remove from pan.
Split into two layers, sandwich together with raspberry jam and
sprinkle icing sugar on top.
