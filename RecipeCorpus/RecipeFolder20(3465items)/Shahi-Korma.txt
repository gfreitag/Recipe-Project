Categories: Asian, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 ea 1" stick of cinnamon
2 ea Medium onions chopped
1 t  Ground coriander
2 t  Black cumin ground
1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
8 ea Cloves garlic
1 ea 1" cube of fresh ginger
5 T  Blanched slivered almonds
1 c  Water or beef broth
7 T  Vegetable oil
2 lb Boned lamb or beef (1" cubes    1 1/4 t  Salt
1 1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/4 t  Garam masala
10 ea Whole cardamom pods
6 ea Whole cloves
Put the garlic,  ginger,  almonds,  and 6 tablespoons water in a
blender and blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a wide,
heavy, preferable non-stick pot or wok over a medium-high heat. When
hot. put in just enough meat pieces so they lie, uncrowded in a
single layer. Brown the meat pieces on all sides, then remove them
with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the meat this
way. Put the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon into the hot oil. Within
seconds the cloves will expand. Now put in the onions. Stir and fry
the onions until they turn a brownish color. Turn the heat down to
medium.
Put in the paste from the blender as well as the coriander, cumin,
and cayenne. Stir  and fry this mixture for 3-4 minutes or until it
too has browned somewhat. Now put in the meat cubes as well as any
liquid that might have accumulated in the meat bowl,
the salt, the cream, and rest of the water or broth (a bit more for
beef). Bring to a  boil.   Cover,
turn heat  to  low  and simmer lamb for 1 hour and beef for 2 hours.
Stir frequently during this cooking period. Skim off any fat that
floats to the top.  Sprinkle in the garam masala and mix.
