Caponata Ebraica * to peel tomatoes, drop them first into boiling
water for about 1 minute, then in cool water and the peel will come
off immediately. according to the author, "It's hard to believe, -for
example, that eggplant and fiocchio (fennel), the quintessence of
Italian cooking, were originally only used by Jews." She quotes
Pellegrino Artusi in the cookbook _Scienza e L'Arte di Mangiar Bene_
published in 1910 that forty year earlier (1870s) that eggplants and
fennel rarely appeared in Florentine markets as they were considered
to be Jewish food only. Peel and dice eggplant. Season with salt &
pepper and set aside in colander to drain off liquid. Heat the oil in
a large skillet; add celery, onion, peppers, garlic and carrot and
cook, uncovered, over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, 10
to 12 minutes. Transfer vegetables to shallow baking dish, but retain
the oil. Add eggplant to oil in skillet and sprinkle with flour. Fry,
stirring, over moderate heat, until lightly golden. Add to baking
dish with vegetables. Add tomatoes, green olives, vinegar, sugar,
basil and parlsey and place in 350F oven for 1/2 hour. Remove from
oven; mix well, taste for seasonings and add salt and pepper if
necessary. Add capers, stir and place in oven for a couple of minutes
longer. Serve hot as a side dish or cold as an appetizer. SERVES: 6
