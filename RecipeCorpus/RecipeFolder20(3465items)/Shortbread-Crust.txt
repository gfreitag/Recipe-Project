~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Working on a large flat surface, such as a pastry board, place the
flour and the sugar in the center of the surface and mix together.
Form a small depression or well in the center of the mound. Add the
beaten egg yolk and the softened butter to the well, ten blend these
with the dry mixture. Mix the ingredients thoroughly using your hands
~- there's no substitute for warm hands. Shape the dough into a ball
and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 10 minutes.  Roll out
the dough to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. You should have a circle
of about 11 inches in diameter.
For best results, roll out your dough between 2 sheets of waxed
paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in a 9-inch circle.
Place the circle inside a 9-inch springform pan. Prick the crust
several times with a fork to keep the crust from puffing up during
the baking. Place the springform pan in the oven and bake for 15 to
20 minutes, or until light brown.  Allow to cool.  Using the leftover
dough, line the sides of the springform pan. Press the dough against
the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as to have a continuous layer
of crust all the way around the sides of the pan.  Make sure that the
side crust meets the bottom crust all the way around.  Brush the
reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the bottom and sides.
This will seal the dough and keep it from becoming soggy. Set aside
until ready to use. NOTE: For the Italian Cheesecake, add 1 ts of
grated lemon rind and 1 ts of Amaretto Liqueur when adding the egg
yolk and butter.
