Categories: Penndutch, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Egg, separated
2 c  Milk
1 c  Yeast
1/3 c  Water, lukewarm
1 x  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar
6 1/2 c  Flour
1 x  *dissolved in:
1 x  Butter, melted
Scald the milk and set aside to cool. Cream the sugar, butter and egg
yolk. Add to this the lukewarm milk, alternately with the flour and
the dissolved yeast cake. Beat lightly and add the stiffly beaten egg
white. Allow this mixture to rise over night. Flour a bake-board and
take out large spoonfuls of the dough to which just enough flour has
been added to permit it to be rolled into flat cakes. Spread on
well-greased pie tins and when light (about 1-1/2 hours) brush melted
butter over the top and strew thickly with brown sugar. If preferred,
spread "rivels" on top by combining 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and
2 Tbsp butter. Crumble together and sprinkle on top of cakes. Bake at
400-F about 20 minutes.
