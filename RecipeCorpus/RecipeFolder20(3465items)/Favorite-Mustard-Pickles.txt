~----------------- Finely chop or grind, through the medium blade of
a food chopper, the cucumbers, onions, and red pepper, and put each
ground vegetable into a separate bowl.  Rinse the food chopper
between each vegetable. Also put into separate bowls, the gherkins,
white onions, and the cauliflower flowerets.
Sprinkle each vegetable with the salt, using about 1/4 c to each
bowl. Cover the gherkins, pickling onions, and cauliflower with cold
water and let all the vegetables stand overnight. In the morning,
drain the chopped vegetables in a colander; drain the whole
vegetables and dry them with a towel.  Mix the vegetables in a
preserving kettle, stir in the sugar and 6 cups of the vinegar, and
bring the mixture to a boil. Combine the flour, mustard, tumeric and
celery salt and mix them to a smooth paste with the remaining
vinegar. Stir the paste gradually into the vegetables and continue to
stir until the sauce is slightly thickened. Turn the pickles into
jars and seal at once. Makes 6 quarts.
