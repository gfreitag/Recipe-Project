Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 ea One in cube ginger chopped
9 ea Cloves garlic
3/4 ea Fresh hod green chili
2 1/4 c  Water
6 T  Vegetable oil
3 ea Medium onions, minced
3 1/3 lb Chicken parts, skinned
2 1/4 t  Salt
2 1/4 T  Coriander seeds
2 1/4 t  Whole cumin
1 1/2 t  Whole black mustard seeds
1 1/2 ea One inch stick cinnamon
6 ea Hole cloves
3/8 t  Whole black peppercorns
3/8 t  Ground nutmeg
1 1/2 ea Whole dried hot red chili
3 c  Grated fresh coconut
Put the coriander seeds,  cumin seeds,  mustard seeds, cinnamon,
cloves, peppercorns,  nutmeg  and red chili in a small frying pan.
Place over a medium  flame.
Now  quickly  'dry-roast'  the  spices,  stirring
them frequently until they emit a very pleasant
'roasted' aroma.  Empty  the spices  into  a  clean coffee grinder or
spice grinder and  grind  until fine. Put spiced in bowl. Put the
coconut into the same frying pan and dry roast it over a medium flame,
stirring all the time.  The coconut should pick up lots of brown
flecks and  also smell roasted.   Put the coconut in the bowl with
the other dry roasted spices. Put the garlic, ginger, and green chili
into the container of  an electric blender, along with some water.
Blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a 10-12 inch frying pan
or saute pan over a medium high flame.   When hot put in the onions.
Stir and fry them until they pick up  brown spots.
Now pour in the garlic-ginger mixture and stir
once. Turn  heat to medium.  Put in the chicken pieces, salt, as
well as the spice  coconut mixture in the bowl. Stir and fry the
chicken for 3-4 minutes  or until it loses its pinkness and turn heat
to low, and cook for 25  to  30 minutes or until chicken is tender.
Stir a few times during this cooking period, making sure that you
turn over each piece of chicken so that it gets evenly colored.
