Title: Cheese and Tomato Souffles
Categories: Vegetable, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Parmesan cheese, grated
Cayenne pepper to taste
3 lg Eggs, separated
1 tb Medium dry sherry
2 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Milk
3 tb Tomato paste
1 c  Swiss cheese, grated
In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.  Stir in flour and cook
the roux, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and add the
milk, scalded, in a stream, whisking vigorously, until the mixture is
thick and smooth. Simmer the sauce for 3-4 minutes, and whisk in the
tomato paste, Swiss and Parmesan cheeses, cayenne, and salt to taste.
Whisk until the cheeses have melted.

Remove from heat and whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time, beating
well after each addition. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and let it
cool.

In a bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with a pinch
of salt until they hold soft peaks.  Add the Sherry and beat to stiff
peaks. Fold the egg white mixture into the cheese mixture gently but
thoroughly.

Transfer the mixture to 6 buttered 2/3-cup ramekins, and bake the
souffles on a jelly roll pan in the middle of a preheated 400foven
for 25-30 minutes, or until they are cooked through.

Serve immediately.
