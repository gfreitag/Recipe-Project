~-- Heat the oil in a large skillet to 375oF.  Deep-fry the fish
fillets until very crispy and golden brown.

Charcoal-broil/grill the chilies, garlic and shallots until their
outsides are charred.  Remove the garlic and shallot skins.

Place the fried fish, chilies, garlic and shallots in a mortor and
mash with the pestle until smooth, or use the blender.

Place the shrimp paste, fish sauce and palm sugar in a small saucepan
and cook for about 15 minutes on medium-high heat, so that the
mixture is reduced to a paste.

Thoroughly combine the mashed ingredients with the reduced sauce
ingredients.  Store in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and use as a
dipping sauce or for cooking.
