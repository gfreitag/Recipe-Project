Title: Sailor Frank
Categories: Snack, Hot dogs
Yield: 1 servings
1 ds Mustard (opt, or ketchup)
1 x  Frankfurter
Use a semi-thawed frankfurter, which is easier to cut. With a knife,
make a straight horizontal slit aboyt 1" from the top. On both sides
of the frank, make a slit upward so the franks looks like it has 2
arms. From the bottom of the frank, make a 1" slit upwards, to make 2
legs. Broil in the oven. As the frank cooks, the "arms" and "legs"
will curl out a bit, making it look more like a person.  When done,
remove from oven and decorate with mustard or ketchup. Put on eyes, a
mouth, buttons, perhaps shoes, etc. Kids love this, especially if
they can help with the decorating!
