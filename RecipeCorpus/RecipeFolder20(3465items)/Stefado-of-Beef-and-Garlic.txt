~----------------- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a heavy pot
that can be covered, combine all the ingredients except the feta,
walnuts and 1/2 cup parsley. Cover tightly and bake for 1 1/2 hours
or more, until the meat is very tender. Lower the oven temperature
during this time, so that the contents of the pot remain at a gentle
simmer.  Skim off the fat.
Do not boil the sacue down; it should remain rather thin. Ladle the
stew into a deep platter.  Granish with feta, walnuts, and the
remaining parsley.
