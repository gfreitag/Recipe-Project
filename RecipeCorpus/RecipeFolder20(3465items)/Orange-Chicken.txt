~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Place chicken, boned side up between two pieces of
clear plastic wrap. Working from the center to the edges, pound
lightly with a meat mallet, forming rectangle about 1/8-inch thick.
Remove plastic wrap.  Sprinkle chicken lightly with salt to taste.
In a small bowl, stir together the shredded orange peel, cooked rice,
and ground cinnamon.  Spoon the rice-orange peel mixture atop the
chicken breast portion, spreading it to within a 1/4 inch of edges.
Fold in sides of chicken breast and roll up, jelly-roll style,
starting at one end. Place chicken roll, seam side down, in a shallow
baking dish. Cover with vented clear plastic wrap. Micro-cook,
covered, on 50% of power for 4 to 5 minutes or till chicken is
tender, rotating the dish a half-turn after 2 minutes. Transfer
chicken roll to a plate. For orange sauce, in a 1-cup measure stir
together orange juice and cornstarch.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100%
power about 1 minute or till the orange juice mixture is thickened
and bubbly, stirring every 20 seconds. Stir in broken walnuts. Spoon
the orange sauce atop the chicken roll on the plate.
Garnish with cucumber rose, if desired.
