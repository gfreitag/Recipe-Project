++ Place the pork chops in an ovenproof casserole.  Mix the remaining
ingredients, except sour cream, and pour over the chops.  Marinate the
chops 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.  Bake the chops, uncovered,
in the marinade in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for 1 hour or until
tender. Add more wine if necessary.  Stir sour cream into pan juices
and heat through but DO NOT boil.  Serve chops with sour-cream gravy
