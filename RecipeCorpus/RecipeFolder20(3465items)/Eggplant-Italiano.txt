2 c  Mozzerella cheese, grated
Salt & pepper to taste

*Eggplant should be young, firm, a deep purple and without surface
blemishes or scars.*

Saute garlic, onion, celery and green pepper in hot oil in a skillet
(I use my beloved wok) for about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and saute 1
minute longer. Add eggplant slices to skillet, stirring well for an
additional 5 minutes. Add seasonings and tomatoes. Cover and heat to
simmering. Place in an oiled shallow casserole (Corning is ideal).
Sprinkle cheese over eggplant and place, covered, in a pre-heated
oven (350F.) for 20 minutes. Remove cover and bake an additional 10
minutes, until bubbly and golden.
