Clean squid and cut body sacs into rings.  Cut tentacles in half.

In a small saucepan, bring stock to a bare simmer.  Crush saffron and
combine it with wine in a small bowl.  In a flameproof casserole or
paella pan, heat the lard over moderately high heat. Saute the
chorizo and pork, turning them until they are browned.  Add the
onion, bell peppers, tomatoes, and squid and cook the mixture over
moderate heat, stirring, for 15 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook
for 1 minute, stirring. Stir in almonds, pine nuts, garlic, saffron
mixture, and artichoke hearts. Ladle in enough stock to just cover
the rice mixture. Bring to a boil and simmer it, covered, for 20
minutes.

Arrange the clams in the rice, add the peas, and simmer for 10-15
minutes, or until the rice is just tender and the clams open. Discard
any clams that do not open.  Garnish with pimientos and parsley.

This is a recipe by Eliz. David, appearing in an article in 1972 by
James Beard.  It originated on Spain's Costa Brava. "not a true
paella, but it is quite good."
