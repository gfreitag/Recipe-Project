I like chicken & I like almonds. When I can find a recipe that
combines both that usually means I am going to enjoy the concoction.
This one does both and I do enjoy it! You too!

Mix the chicken, mayonnaise, yogurt, soup, broth, pepper, salt, lemon
juice, onion, rice, water chestnuts, 1 cup almonds, & celery
together. Put into a large buttered casserole dish.

Mix 1/2 cup almonds, the butter, and the corn flakes together and top
the casserole with this mixture. Bake in a pre-heated 350 degree F
oven for 35-45 minutes. Serves 4-6 **NOTE** This dish refrigerates
well and freezes well so it can be perparted ahead and stored.
