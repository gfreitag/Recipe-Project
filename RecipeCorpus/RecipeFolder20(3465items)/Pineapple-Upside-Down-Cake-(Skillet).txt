This one may be a little strange to you, but is a classic in its own
right. The difference between this one and the one you usually find
in the cookbook, is that this one uses a skillet for a baking pan.

Drain the pineapple, reserving 2 Tbls of the juice.  Melt the butter
in a heavy 10-inch ovenproof skillet.  Stir in the brown sugar and
reserved pineapple syrup, blending well.  Remove from the heat.
Arrange the pineapple slices in the sugar mixture in a balanced
arrangement. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each
pineapple slice.

Combine the flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Add the milk and oil then beat, with an electric mixer set on high
speed, for 2 minutes.  Add the egg, lemon rind, lemon juice and
vanilla extract and beat for an additional 2 minutes.  Carefully pour
the batter over the pineapple in the skillet, spreading evenly. Bake
in a preheated oven for 25 minutes or until the cake tests done.
Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Place a
serving plate upside down on the top of the skillet and invert the
skillet and plate. Serve this cake warm.

VARIATION:

For Peach Upside-Down Cake, use a can of peach halves instead of the
pineapple slices and proceed as above.
