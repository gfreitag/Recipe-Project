Snap off tough ends of asparagus.  If asparagus is thick, old or
tough, peel bottoms.  Add asparagus to pan of boiling salted water.
Boil gently until cooked--bright green and tender--but still firm,
about 5 to 8 minutes.  Remove; drain on towel; put on platter and
drizzle with oil, lifting spears to coat.
Sprinkle with shallots and parsley.  Salt slightly.
