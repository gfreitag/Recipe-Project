Title: Creamed Onions
Categories: Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 t  Cayenne pepper
4 T  Butter
1/2 t  Salt
8 ea White onions
1/2 pt Whipping cream
4 T  Flour
Peel the onions.  Parboil in about 3/4 cup water.
(I do this part    in a covered casserole in the microwave). Make
white sauce with    rest of ingredients. If you like a stronger onion
flavor, thin the    white sauce with part or all of the onion water.
Otherwise, thin it    with your choice of cream, milk, water, chicken
broth or whatever
flavor you like.  Add onions and bake at 325 to 350 until bubbly.
If you're a real creamed onion pig like we are, this will not serve
four.
