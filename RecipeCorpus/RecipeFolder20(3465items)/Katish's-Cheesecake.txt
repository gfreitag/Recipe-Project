In a bowl, stir together the zwieback, butter, and sugar until the

9-inch springform pan. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream
together the sugar and cream cheese until the mixture is light and
fluffy. Add the flour, salt, vanilla bean, and egg yolks, beaten
lightly, and combine the mixture well. Stir in the sour cream.  In a
bowl, beat the egg whites until they just hold stiff peaks and fold
them into the cream cheese mixture gently but thoroughly. Pour the
filling into the pan and run a rubber spatula through the filling in
a circle about one inch from the rim to help the cake rise evenly.

turn off and let the cake stand in the oven for 30 minutes. Let the
cake cool completely or until it is set, in the pan on a rack. Chill
the cake covered, overnight. Remove the cake from the pan and garnish
it with lemon slices. a 1945 Gourmet Mag. favorite.
