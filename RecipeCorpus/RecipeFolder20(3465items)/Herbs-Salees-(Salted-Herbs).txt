"Salted herbs are a central element in traditional Acadian cuisine;
they are a basic ingredient in fricot, soups and most dishes which
use meat and fish. Traditionally made with chives, shallots and onion
shoots, salted herbs may also contain finely chopped onions."

Layer the ingredients in a stoneware or glass pot. Let the mixture
stand for several days until a brine is formed. Use as a seasoning in
a variety of fish and meat dishes.
