1. Transfer the kidney beans and the water in which they were soaked
to a large heavy saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a
boil over high heat. Lower the heat and continue boiling the beans,
partially covered, until tender, about 1 hour. Watch the water level
and add more, if necessary, to keep the beans from scorching.~ 2.
Meanwhile, place the tomato juice in another saucepan and bring to a
boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat immediately and add the
bulghur to the juice. Cover and let stand for 15 minutes. It should
be slightly crunchy. Set aside.~ 3. Heat the olive oil in a large
heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook until
the onions are translucent. Add the celery, carrots, tomatoes, lemon
juice, and all the spices - including the remaining salt - to the
onions and cook, covered, until the vegetables are nearly tender,
about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the bell peppers and continue cooking
another 10 minutes.~ 4. Add the kidney beans, the water in which they
cooked, and the bulghur to the vegetables in the large pot. Stir the
mixture thoroughly and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat. The chili
may be thick - add water as necessary and stir occasionally making
sure the bulghur does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Taste and
adjust seasonings.~
