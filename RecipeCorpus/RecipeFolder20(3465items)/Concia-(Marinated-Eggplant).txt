Garlic; minced
Basil, fresh; shredded
An ancient Roman Jewish dish No quantities are given "as they are not
important; Concia can be prepared to be more less piquant, according
to taste, by increasing or decreasing the quantity of herbs and
spices. It freezes beautifully in a tightly closed container, but it
must be used within a few days if stored in the refrigerator or after
thawing, being a rather perishable food. Eggplant was also prepared
as Concia in Rome, but its texture is less desirable than eggplant.

Trim off the ends of the zucchini; then cut each one in half; slice
each half thinly lengthwise and place slices on paper towel to dry
for several hours or overnight. Fry in hot olive oil in a single
layer until golden brown on both sides. Arrange in layers in glass,
plastic or porcelain container and season each layer with small
amounts of garlic, basil, salt and pepper, and a sprinkle of vinegar.
Cover the container and store in the refrigerator at least several
hours before using. The flavour will be enhanced if you turn the
Concia as a block inside the container a few times while it is
marinating to allow the juices to seep through.
