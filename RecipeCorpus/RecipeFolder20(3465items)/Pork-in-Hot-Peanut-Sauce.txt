+++++++++++++++++++ Soak radish in warm water for 45 minutes. Cut
pork into 1/2" cubes. Drain & rinse canned bean curd; cut into 1/2"
cubes. (If using fresh bean curd, wrap it in clean dish towel and
press it for 1 hour to make it more firm. Wrap it tightly & use about
a 5-pound weight.) Drain radish & cut into 1/2" cubes.  Cut green
onions, including tops, into 2" lengths. Sauce: In a cup, cream
together peanut butter and soy sauce. Slowly mix in remaining sauce
ingredients.  Set aside. Stir-frying:  Add oil to hot wok. When oil
starts to smoke, add pork. Stir-fry for about 1 minute. Add garlic &
ginger; stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Transfer pork to saucepan;
add peanut sauce; heat & simmer for 15 minutes, adding onions about
mid-way. Skim off excess oil.  Add more stock if sauce thickens.
Steaming: In Chinese steamer, steam radish & bean curd on its serving
plate for 15 minutes, just prior to serving. When ready to serve,
drain water off plate, and top vegetables with pork & peanut sauce.
