Categories: Bread
Yield: 16 servings
2 t  Salt
6 oz Lard
1 oz Fresh yeast
1/2 lb Demerara sugar
2 ea Eggs
1/4 lb Dried fruit
4 oz Candied peel
1 pt Warm water
1/2 t  Mixed spice
2 lb Plain flour
Oven: 450F, Gas Mark 8 for 15 minutes: 375F, Gas Mark 5 for 45
minutes. Soak the fruit and candied peel in the water with the spice.
Leave to steep in a warm place and use the warm spicy, strained water
to mix the dough. Sift the flour and salt and rub in the lard; cream
the yeast with the sugar and a little of the spiced water; mix this
into the flour, together with the eggs and use enough of the water to
give a firm, yet elastic dough. Knead well, leave to rise and knock
back;  blend in the drained fruit and knead again. Shape the dough
into loaves and set into greased 1 lb tins in a warm place to prove;
bake, reducing the temperature after the first 15 minutes.
Originally, in some recipies, the fruit content would have been fresh
currants or blackberries. Bara Brith is often served as part of the
traditional Welsh tea.  It can also be purchased at many of the small
bakeries found throughout Wales. British Cookery (BTA/BFPC)
