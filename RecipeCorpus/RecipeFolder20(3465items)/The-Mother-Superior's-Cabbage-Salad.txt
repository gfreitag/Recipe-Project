La salade de choux de la Mere Superieure

From Mme Benoit, "The Mother Superior at the village convent would
prepare this recipe from special guests. Many people still make this
cabbage salad with sour cream."

Mix together in a large bowl, grated cabbage, minced onion, salt and
grated apples. Mix together sugar, vinegar, salt, pepper and thick
sour cream. Refrigerate the salad and dressing for 20 minutes before
serving. Then pour the dressing over the cabbage, mix well, and salt
for salt and vinegar.
