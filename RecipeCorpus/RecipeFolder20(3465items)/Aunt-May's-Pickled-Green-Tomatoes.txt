~----------------- Arrange the tomatoes in layers in a large bowl or
pickle crock, sprinkling the salt between the layers. Let stand
overnight. The next day, drain, sprinkle with the alum, and pour the
boiling water over them. Let stand for 20 minutes.
Drain, rinse, and drain again.  In an enamel or stainless stell
preserving kettle combine cider vinegar, sugar and the spices, tied
in a cheesecloth bag.  (The spice bag should be kept in the syrup
right up to the very end.) Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is
dissolved and boil rapidly for 3 minutes.
Pour the syrup over the tomatoes and let stand overnight. Next day,
drain off syrup and bring to a boil. Pour over tomatoes and let stand
again overnight.  On the fourth day, put syrup and tomatoes into the
kettle, bring to a boil and simmer until the tomatoes are
transparent. Pack the tomatoes into hot jars. Boil the syrup until it
becomes quite thick or spins a long thread. Remove the spice bag and
pour the syrup over the fruit, filling the jars and seal. Makes 8
Quarts.
