Title: Granola Mix
Categories: Misc/food, Mixes
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Wheat Germ
2 c  Shelled Raw Sunflower Seeds
3 c  Chopped Nuts
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Honey
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 ts Vanilla
10 c  Old Fashioned Rolled Oats
1/2 lb Shredded Coconut
1 c  Sesame Seeds
1 1/2 c  Brown Sugar, Firmly Packed
1 1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
1/2 c  Molasses
2 ts Cinnamon
Raisins Or Other Dried Fruit
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. (150 degrees F.).  In a large bowl
combine oats, wheat germ, coconut, sunflower seeds, sesame seed and
nuts ( can include almonds, pecans, walnuts, or a combination of all
of them). Blend well.  In a large saucepan combine brown sugar,
water, oil, honey, molasses, salt, cinnamon and vanilla. Heat until
sugar is dissolved, but do not boil.  Pour the syrup over the dry
ingredients and stir until well-coated. Spread onto five 13 X 9-inch
baking pans, or cookie sheets with sides.  Bake 20 to 30 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Bake 15 minutes longer for crunchier texture.
Cool.  Add raisins or other dried fruit, if desired.  Put in airtight
containers and label as Granola mix. Store in a cool dry place and
use within 6 months.

Makes about 20 cups of mix.
