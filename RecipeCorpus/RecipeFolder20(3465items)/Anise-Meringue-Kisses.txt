Title: Anise Meringue Kisses
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 48 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Ground anise seeds
3    Egg whites
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after-
dinner dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy,
but if you prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn
off the oven and, with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to
an hour. These cookies are generally baked on parchment paper, but we
have found that regular bond paper makes a very acceptable
substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg whites until frothy.
Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar.
Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise. Using pastry
bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275 degrees F.
30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue is
desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed
about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0
