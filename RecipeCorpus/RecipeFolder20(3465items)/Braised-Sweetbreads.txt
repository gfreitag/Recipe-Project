Title: Braised Sweetbreads
Categories: Meat
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Finely minced shallots
1 c  Dry sherry
1 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Unsalted butter
Lemon slices
1 1/2 lb Calf's sweetbreads
1/8 ts Ground mace
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Flour
3 tb Flavorless cooking oil
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Pat the sweetbreads dry and peel and discard
the most obvious membranes without breaking the sweetbreads into
small pieces. Mix mace, salt and pepper with flour, and dust the
sweetbreads, shaking off the excess. Heat the oil in a heavy,
oven-proof frying pan over medium heat on the stove and add the
sweetbreads. Cook until they are dark golden on both sides, about 5
minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan or they won't brown. Tilt the
pan and pour off any remaining oil and add the shallots, wine and
broth and bring to a boil. Cover the skillet and transfer to the
oven. Turn temperature to 325F and cook 35 minutes, turning once.
Remove pan from oven and use a slotted spoon to transfer the
sweetbreads to a platter. Add the cream to the cooking juices and
quickly boil the liquid until it starts to become sauce-like, about
10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. When it's
time for dinner, strain the sauce over the sweetbreads; decorate with
slices of lemon.
