Title: Cookie Ice Cream-A-Rounds
Categories: Dessert, Cake/cookie
Yield: 15 servings
1 pk Vanill ice cream (1/2 gall.)
1 pk Pills. Slice'n Bake cookies
Use Pillsbury Slice'n Bake Chocolate Chip cookies (large roll). Slice
1 roll well-chilled Pillsbury Refrigerated Cookie Dough into 1/4"
slices. Place 2" apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 9-12 min. or
until golden brown.  Cool completely.  Use 2 cookies for each
sandwich. Place 1 scoop ice cream on bottom of 1 cookie. Top with
second cookie. Gently press together in center to spread ice cream to
edge.  Serve immediately or wrap sandwich in foil and freeze.
About 15 sandwichs. This is great with Chocolate chip cookies and
vanilla ice cream but would probably be great with any Pillsbury
cookie and any ice cream flavor you prefer.
