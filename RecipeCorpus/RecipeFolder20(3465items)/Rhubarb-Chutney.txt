Title: Rhubarb Chutney
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Paprika
1 tb Black mustard seeds
1/4 c  Currants
1 c  Light brown sugar
1 1/2 c  Light vinegar
1 lb Rhubarb
2 ts Coarsely grated fresh ginger
2    Garlic cloves

WASH THE RHUBARB AND SLICE into pieces 1/4-inch thick. If the stalks
are wide, cut them in halves or thirds lengthwise, first. Finely chop
the grated ginger with the garlic and chile. Place all the
ingredients in a non-corrosive pan, bring to a boil, then lower the
heat and simmer until the rhubarb is broken down and is the texture
of a jam, about 30 minutes. Store refrigerated in a glass jar.
