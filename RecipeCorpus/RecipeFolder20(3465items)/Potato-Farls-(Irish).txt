Categories: Bread, Appetizer
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 t  Salt
4 t  Vegetable Oil
1 1/4 lb Potatoes (3 or 4)
2 T  Butter, melted
1 c  Flour, all purpose
Peel and halve potatoes; put in large saucepan with enough water to
cover. Bring to boil; simmer, covered, 20 to 30 minutes, until
fork-tender. Drain well; return to saucepan over low heat.  Add
butter; mash potatoes well. Stir in flour and salt.  Gather mixture
into a ball; turn onto lightly floured surface. Knead lightly until
smooth. Divide dough in half. Roll out one half into an 8 in. (20 cm)
circle, about 1/4 in. thick. Cut into quarters; set aside.
Repeat with remaining dough.  In large nonstick skillet, heat half
the oil over medium-high heat.
Cook dough quarters in batches, 2 minutes on each side or until
golden brown, adding more oil as necessary. Serve warm.
