Title: Sourdough Sams
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1/4 t  Cinnamon
1/2 t  Baking Soda
1/2 t  Salt
1/3 c  Buttermilk or Sour Milk
1/2 c  Active Sourdough Starter
1/2 c  Sugar
2 T  Shortening
2 c  Unbleached Flour
1 t  Baking Powder
1 ea Large Egg
Sift dry ingredients, stir into liquid, roll out and cut with regular
donut cutter.  Then heat some oil in a deep fryer to 390 degrees F
and fry. Makes about 17 Doughnuts with holes. Just before serving
dust with powdered or cinnamon sugar. NOTE: These doughnuts are
virtually greasless. And if you want you can make several batches at
a time and freeze. They keep well and to me taste after a while in
the freezer. Take out as many as needed and thaw and put sugar on or
eat plain.
