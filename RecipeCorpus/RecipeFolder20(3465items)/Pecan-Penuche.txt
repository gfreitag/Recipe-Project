Title: Pecan Penuche
Categories: Candy
Yield: 10 servings
2 1/2 tb Butter; In Small Pieces
1 t  Vanilla
3/4 c  Pecans; Chopped
2 c  Dark Brown Sugar; Firm Pack
3/4 c  Milk
1/8 t  Salt
Oil a jelly-roll pan or an 8 X 8-inch pan.  Combine the sugar, milk
and salt in a heavy 3-quart pot, stirring to mix well. Place over
medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until the sugar
dissolves. Cove and let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.
Uncover and wash down the sides of the pot with a pastry brush
dipped in cold water.  Continue to boil, over medium heat, to the
firm ball stage (240-250 degrees F.), stirring only if it starts to
burn.
Remove from the heat and immediately place the pot in a larger pot
filled with cold water; this will stop the cooking process and bring
the temperature down.
Drop in the butter and let cool slightly, without stirring. beat
until it starts to thicken, add the vanilla and the pecans and
continue to beat until the candy loses some of its gloss. Spread
evenly in the pan and mark into squares.  When firm, cut into pieces
and store in an airtight container. From Fannie Farmer's New Cookbook
