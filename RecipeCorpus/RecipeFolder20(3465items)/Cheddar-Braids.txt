++++++++++++++++++ Pour the warm water into a warm bowl and add the
yeast. Stir to dissolve then let stand until light and puffed, about
5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, sugar and salt. Beat with an
electric mixer on the lowest speed for 1 minute.  Beat on medium
speed for 2 minutes longer. Add the butter to the yeast mixture and
beat for another 1 minute.
On the lowest speed on the mixer, beat in 1 egg and 1/2 cup of flour
until well blended, repeating until the 4 eggs are used up and enough
flour has been added to make a soft sticky dough. Continue to beat
with the mixer or by hand, until the dough is glossy and elastic and
pulls away from the side of the bowl.
Stir in the cheddar cheese by hand.  Cover and let rise in a warm
place free from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
When the dough has doubled in bulk, punch down and place in the
refrigerator for at least 5 hours or better, overnight. Remove the
dough from the refrigerator.
Divide in half and cover and refrigerate the second ball of dough.
Knead the remaining ball of dough on a lightly floured surface until
soft and pliable.
Divide the dough into 3 equal parts and roll each piece into a rope
12 to 16-inches long.  Braid the ropes, starting in the middle and
working toward each end. Pinch the ends together so seal them. Grease
a large baking sheet and place the finished braid on one side of the
sheet. Repeat with the refrigerated dough. In a small bowl beat the
egg and milk together. Brush the braids with the egg mixture and let
the braids rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until dough in
bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Do not cover.  Midway through the
rising time, brush with the egg mixture again. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees F.
When fully risen, brush with the egg mixture for a final time and
sprinkle evenly with the celery seeds.
Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until a wooden skewer or
pick inserted in the braid comes out dry. Remove from the oven and
from the baking sheet.
Cool to room temperature, on wire racks, before slicing.
