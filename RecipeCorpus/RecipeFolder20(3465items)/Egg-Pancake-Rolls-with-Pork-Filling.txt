Categories: Appetizer, Pork
Yield: 8 servings
Carrots, finely chopped
(for garnish)
4    Eggs
1 tb Dry sherry
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 ts Cornstarch, dissolved in
2 tb Water, cold
1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1 ts Salt
1 tb Peanut oil
1 c  (about 1/2 lb) ground pork,
Uncooked
2 md Fresh mushrooms,
Chopped fine
2    Scallions, chopped fine
(white parts separate from
The green)
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
Dash hot chili oil or
Tabasco
Sauce
2 tb Oyster sauce
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Plum sauce
In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl,
combine all the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of
the chopped scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to
blend well. In a 8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly.  Pour about a
quarter of the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet.  Heat
until the egg pancake has barely set, then transfer to a plate.  Make
3 more pancakes. Divide the filling into 4 portions and put a
portions on each pancake. Moisten your fingers with cold water and
spread the filling mixture evenly over the surface of the pancake,
then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll. Seal with a little
leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl.  Place the rolls on a flat
plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an inch of
simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the
slant. Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens
and the carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.
