~----------------- Butter the baking dish, pie pan, or springform pan
until generously coated. Sprinkle the crumbs as needed into the pan,
then turn the pan around and shake gently, distributing the crumbs
along the sides as well. The crumbs should completely coat the inside
of the pan. Chill briefly to set the crumbs and then fill with the
desired filling. CAKE: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  Sift
together the flour and baking powder and set aside. Press the cottage
cheese through a sieve. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and the
sugar until they are frothy. Add the spices and fruit rinds. Add the
cottage cheese and blend all the ingredients well.
Stir in the butter, then add the dry mixture, mixing well. Pour the
mixture into the prepared crust and bake for 1 hour. NOTE: Again this
is more like a quick bread, and you can increase the sugar if you
like as this is not particularly sweet.
