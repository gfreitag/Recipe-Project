Poitrine de Poulet au Sirop D'Erable

Chicken and pork are often baked or braised in maple syrup in the
Beauce. This easy recipe for chicken breasts can also be used with a
whole cut-up broiler-fryer chicken. It's from the collection of
Jeanne d'Arc Nadeau, long-time proprietor of Le Danube Bleu reception
hall in St. Marie and a cookbook author.

Dredge chicken pieces in flour seasoned with salt and pepper to
taste. In a heavy, flameproof casserole, heat butter until bubbling
and brown chicken pieces. Pour maple syrup over chicken. Sprinkle
with savory, thyme and sage. Arrange onion slices on top of chicken
pieces. Pour water into the bottom of the casserole. Bake, uncovered
in 350F oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until tender, basting
occasionally with pan juices. SERVES: 4
