Shrimp should be of a size to number 30-35 per pound. Melt the butter
and oil in a flameproof baking dish.
Add the garlic, herbs, peppers, bay leaves, paprika, and lemon
juice, and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down and simmer 10
minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the dish from the heat and let
the flavors marry at least 30 minutes.  This hot butter sauce can be
made a day in advance and refrigerated.
Preheat the oven to 450F.  Reheat the sauce, add the shrimp, and
cook over medium heat until the shrimp just turn pink, then bake in
the oven about 30 minutes more. Taste for seasoning, adding salt if
necessary. Nathalie Dupree writes of this recipe in her book "New
Southern Cooking," "Shrimp taste better when cooked in their shells
because the fat under the shells preserves their flavor and
tenderness. When the shells are crisp it is a pleasure to eat the
shrimp with their shells on. This rich butter sauce cries out to be
sopped up with crusty bread once the shrimp are gone."
