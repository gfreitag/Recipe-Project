Title: Colcannon
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
2 x  Garlic cloves, minced
1 ds Salt
1 ds Pepper
2 tb Margarine (soy)
1 bn Parsley
1 lb Potatoes, sliced
2 md Parsnips,peeled and sliced
2 md Leeks
1 c  Potato or soy milk
1 lb Kale or cabbage
1/2 ts Mace (optional)
Cook the potatoes and parsnips in water until tender. While these are
cooking,chop leeks (greens as well as whites) and simmer in the milk
until soft. Next, cook the kale or cabbage and have warm and well
chopped. Drain the potatoes, season with mace,garlic, salt and
pepper, and beat well. Add the cooked leeks and milk (be careful not
to break down the leeks too much). Finally, blend in the kale or
cabbage and margarine. The texture should be that of a smooth-buttery
potato with well distributed pieces of leek and kale. Garnish with
parsley. Colcannon is also made by cooking layered vegetables,
starting with potatoes, in a slow-cooker during the day. Drain
vegetables, blend with milk and margarine as above and garnish with
parsley. Total calories per serving-288 Fat-7grams From the
