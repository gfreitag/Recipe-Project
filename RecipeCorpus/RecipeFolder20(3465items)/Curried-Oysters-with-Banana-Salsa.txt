SALSA-------------------------------- *    Use the best curry powder
that you can find. Also the freshest. ** Cut the red bananas into
1/4-inch dice. *** Cut the red pepper into 1/4-inch dice. In a very
heavy skillet, saute the curry powder in the butter until fragrant.
Stir in the shallots and garlic, and add the fumet. Reduce the
mixture until 1/4 cup remains. Whisk in the cream and continue
reducing until slightly thick.  Whisk in the lime juice and salt.
Broil or grill the oysters over pecan or mesquite until they open.
Remove the top shell, pour the curry sauce over them and top with the
Banana Salsa. Serve. FISH FUMET: Combine all of the ingredients in a
large saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 40
minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for another 30 minutes.
Strain and reserve the liquid. BANANA SALSA: Mix all of the
ingredients together blending well. From the Coyote Cafe Cookbook By
