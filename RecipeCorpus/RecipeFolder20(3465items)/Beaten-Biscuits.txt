Title: Beaten Biscuits
Categories: Cajun/creol, Bread
Yield: 100 servings
1 t  Baking powder
1 c  Shortening
1 c  Milk
6 c  All purpose flour (soft)
1 1/2 t  Salt
1 T  Sugar
Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl or in a food
processor fitted with a metal blade.
Add the shortening and cut in or process until the mixture is the
consistency of coarse meal.  Pour in the milk and stir or process just
until the dough holds together. If it is dry or crumbly, add more
milk. If it is too wet, add more flour.  Knead briefly in the food
processor, then turn out onto a floured board or beat 1,001 times
with a rolling pin.
when it's ready, the dough should "snap" when you hit it. Fold the
dough in half.    Roll out the folded dough until it is 1/2 inch
thick. Cut with a 1-1/4-inch biscuit cutter into small rounds. Prick
each round with a fork, making two parallel sets of holes in the
biscuit. keep rolling out the dough, folding before cutting, until
all the scraps are gone and you have made about 100 biscuits.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the biscuits on a lightly
greased pan.  Bake for 30 minutes, until crisp, but not browned. They
should open easily when split with a fork. They will keep for weeks
tightly covered in a tin or in the freezer.
