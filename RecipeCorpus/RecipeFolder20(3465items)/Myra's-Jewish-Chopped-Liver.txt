Title: Myra's Jewish Chopped Liver
Categories: Poultry, Appetizer

Peeled
2 tb Brandy
1/2 ts Kosher salt
Pepper to taste
1 lb Chicken livers
1/2 c  Schmaltz or Nyafat
1 lg Onion, coarsely chopped
3    Eggs, hard boiled and
In broiler pan, spread livers and broil until very well done (no
pinkness remaining).  In skillet, melt schmaltz and saute onion until
very brown. Add livers and cook an additional few minutes, allowing
the liver to absorb the schmaltz-onion flavor.

In food processor or blender, chop eggs, add the liver-onion mixture
and remaining ingredients.  Pulse until everything is ground and mixed
together.

Put in bowl or crock and refrigerate.

NOTE:  Schmaltz is rendered chicken fat with onion, and is available
in the kosher section of your market.  Nyafat is a cholesterol-free,
schmaltz-flavored vegetable shortening, also available in the kosher
section.
