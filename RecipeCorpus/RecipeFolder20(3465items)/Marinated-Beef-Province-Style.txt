Cut meat into 2 inch cubes.  Dice the bacon.  Skin and crush the
garlic, using the tip of a firm knife, in a pinch of salt on the
chopping board, or use a garlic press; blend with the chopped
parsley, cloves,
and allspice. Put  the meat into a dish,  and add the wine vinegar,
wine, and garlic spice  mixture.
Peel  and  thinly slice one third of  the  onions
and carrots,  add to the marinade with a little salt and pepper.
Leave for at least 12 hours turning occasionally. Peel the remaining
onions and carrots,
quarter the onions but leave the carrots  whole.
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet,  fry the
diced bacon  and  quartered  onions  until golden
brown,  and  spoon  into  a casserole. Remove the meat from the
marinade, drain well.
Brown meat in the oil remaining  in the pan and add to the onions.
Pour the marinade  liquid and vegetables into the skillet and stir
well to absorb the last of the oil. Add the whole carrots, brandy,
and herbs. Cut the zest from the orange and squeeze a little orange
juice and add this and the zest to the sauce. Season the sauce with a
little salt and pepper. Pour over the meat and onions, cover the
casserole. Cook in the center of a slow (350 d F) for 2 1/4 hours. To
serve, remove the garni.
This dish is particularly good  when  served  with spaghetti,
macaroni, or noodles, topped with butter, grated cheese and a little
chopped parsley.
