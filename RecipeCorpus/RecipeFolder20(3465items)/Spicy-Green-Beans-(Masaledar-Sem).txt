Categories: Asian, Side dish, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
1 ea Dried hot red chili
2 t  Ground coriander
1 1/4 t  Salt
3 T  Lemon juice
1 t  Ground roasted cumin
1 1/2 lb Fresh green beans
1 ea In cube peeled chopped ginge
10 ea Whole cloves garlic
1 1/2 c  Water
5 T  Vegetable oil
2 t  Whole cumin seeds
Trim  the green beans and cut them crosswise at 1/4 in
intervals.   Put the  ginger and garlic into the container of an
electric blender or food processor.
Add 1/3 of the water and blend until fairly smooth. Heat the oil in a
wide,  heavy saucepan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin
seeds.   Five seconds later, put in the crushed chili. As soon as it
darkens,  pour in the ginger-garlic paste.   Stir and cook for about a
minute.   Put in the coriander.
Stir a few times.  Now put in the chopped tomatoes.
Stir and cook for about 2 minutes, mashing up the tomato pieces
with the back of a slotted spoon as you do so. Put in the beans, salt
and the remaining water. Bring to simmer. Cover, turn heat to low
and cook for about 8-10 minutes or until  the  beans
are tender.   Remove the cover.   Add the lemon juice, roasted
cumin, and a generous  amount of freshly ground pepper. Turn heat up
and boil away all of the liquid, stirring the beans gently as you do
so.
