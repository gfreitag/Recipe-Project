Title: Acadian Peppered Shrimp
Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Fish
Yield: 4 servings
5 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1 ea Bay leaf, crumbled
1/2 c  Black pepper, finely ground
1 x  Salt
4 lb Large raw shrimp in shells
1 lb Butter
1/2 c  Lemon juice
2 t  Fresh basil, chopped
2 t  Cayenne pepper
2 t  Fresh oregano, chopped
The shrimp should be of a size to number 30-35 per pound. Melt the
butter in a large deep-sided frying pan or iron skillet over low
heat. When melted, raise the heat, and add the remaining ingredients
except the shrimp.  Cook, stirring often, until browned to a rich
mahogany color, about 10 minutes.  Add the shrimp, stirring and
turning to coat well with the seasoned butter. Cook until the shrimp
have turned a rich deep pink, about 10 minutes.  Serve the shrimp in
their shells, peeling them at the table. From Nathalie Dupree's "New
Southern Cooking"
