Categories: Dessert, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 7 servings
1/2 ts Almond extract
1    Envelope (1.3 ounces)
Whipped topping mix
1/2 c  Cold skim milk
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
2/3 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Cocoa
1 1/2 c  (12-oz can) evaporated
Skim milk
In a medium saucepan, stir together gelatin, sugar and cocoa; add
evaporated milk, stirring until blended.  Let stand 1 minute.  Cook
over low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin is completely
dissolved, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat; pour mixture into
large bowl.  Stir in almond extract.  Refrigerate, stirring
occasionally, until mixture mounds slightly when dropped from spoon.
In small mixer bowl, stir together topping mix, milk and vanilla;
whip on high speed of electric mixer until topping peaks, about 2
minutes.  Continue beating 2 minutes longer until topping is light
and fluffy.  Reserve 1/2 topping for garnish (cover and refrigerate
until ready to use); fold remaining topping into chocolate mixture.
Let stand a few minutes; spoon into dessert dishes. Refrigerate until
cold. Garnish with reserved topping. Seven 1/2 cup servings.
