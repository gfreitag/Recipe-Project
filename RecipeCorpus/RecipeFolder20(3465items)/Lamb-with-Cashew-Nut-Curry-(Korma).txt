Categories: Asian, Main dish, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Saffron threads
6 T  Ghee (or melted butter)
1 c  Chopped onion
2 t  Salt
1/2 c  Unflavored yoghurt
1 1/2 lb Lamb cut into 2" cubes
2 T  Finely chopped coriander
1 T  Lemon juice
1/4 c  Boiling water
1 c  Cold water
1/4 c  Unsalted cashews
3 ea Dried hot red chilies
2 ea In piece of stick cinnamon
1 ea 1 in cube fresh ginger
1/4 t  Cardamom seeds
3 ea Whole cloves
2 ea Large garlic cloves peeled
2 T  Poppy seed (white)
1 T  Coriander seeds
1 t  Cumin seeds
To make the masala,  combine the cashews,  chilies, ginger and the
cold water  and  blend  at  high speed for 1 minutes. Add the
cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, garlic, poppy seeds, coriander seeds and
cumin. Blend again until the mixture is completely pulverized. Set
the masala aside. Place  the saffron in a small bowl, pour in boiling
water and let soak for at least 10 minutes. In  a  heavy skillet heat
the ghee over moderate heat until  a  drop  of water flicked into it
sputters instantly. Add the onions and, stirring constantly,  fry for
7 or 8 minutes,
until soft and golden brown.  Stir in   the  salt
and  the  masala,   then  add  the  yoghurt.
Stirring occasionally,  cook over moderate heat until the ghee
lightly films  the surface. Add the lamb, turning it about with a
spoon to coat the pieces evenly. Squeeze the saffron between your
fingers, thin stir it and its  soaking liquid  into the skillet.
Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly,
and cook  for  20 minutes,  turning the lamb cubes over from time to
time. Scatter  1/2 of the fresh coriander over the lamb and continue
cooking, tightly covered for 10 minutes more, or until the lamb is
tender. To serve, transfer  the  entire contents of the skillet to a
heated platter, and sprinkle the top with lemon juice and the
remaining fresh coriander.
