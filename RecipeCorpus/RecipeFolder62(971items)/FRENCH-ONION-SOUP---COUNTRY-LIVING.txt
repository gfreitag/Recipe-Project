Title: FRENCH ONION SOUP - COUNTRY LIVING
Categories: Soups, Microwave
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Butter
1 lg (about 1/2 lb) onion, very
-thinly sliced
1 tb Brown sugar
1 cn (10 1/2-oz) condensed beef
-broth
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
4    1-inch-thick slices French
-bread, toasted
1/4 c  Coarsely grated reduced-fat
-Jarlsberg cheese
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley leaves
NOTE: For best results, use a sweet onion, such as Vidalia or Texas
Sweet, in this classic soup recipe. When microwaved, these high-sugar
onions cook more quickly and are less bitter than more pungent
varieties.

1. In 2-quart microwave-safe bowl, microwave butter on high (100
percent) 20 seconds or until melted. Stir in onion and brown sugar.
Cover with waxed paper and microwave on medium (50 percent) 5 minutes.

2. Stir in undiluted broth and water; cover with paper and microwave
on medium 10 minutes, stirring after 5 minutes. Stir in pepper. (Soup
can be made ahead up to this point and kept refrigerated; reheat
before Step 3.)

3. Place bread slices on microwave-safe plate; divide cheese among
slices. Microwave on high 20 seconds or until cheese is just melted.

4. To serve, divide soup among 4 small soup bowls; place one
cheese-topped bread slice in each bowl and top with parsley. Serve
immediately.
