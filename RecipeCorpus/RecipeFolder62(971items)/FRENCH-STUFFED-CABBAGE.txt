Title: FRENCH STUFFED CABBAGE
Categories: Vegetables, Lamb/mutton, Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
1 md Cabbage, green
1 tb Butter
1/4 c  Onion; minced
1    Egg
1/4 lb Pork sausage, bulk
1 c  Lamb, cooked; chopped
1 c  Rice, cooked
1    Garlic clove; minced
2 tb Fresh bread crumbs
1/2 ts Salt
1 ds Pepper
1    Carrot; sliced
1    Onion; thinly sliced
2 sl Bacon
16 oz Canned tomatoes
In a large saucepan, simmer the whole cabbage in boiling salted water
to cover for five minutes. Shock the cabbage with cold water to
refresh, then drain well.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.

In a small skillet over medium heat, cook the minced onion in the
butter until tender.  In a medium bowl, beat the egg, then add the
sausage, lamb, rice, cooked onion, garlic, crumbs, salt and pepper.
Mix thoroughly. Set aside.

In a deep three-quart casserole, arrange the carrot and onion slices
in a single layer. Place two 20" lengths of string criss-cross on top
of the vegetables.  Set the cabbage, stem end down, on top of the
string. With a knife, cut out a three-inch round core from the center
of the cabbage, to about two inches from bottom.  Fill the cavity
with the stuffing. Lay the bacon slices across the top of the
cabbage.  With string, tie the cabbage together firmly, pulling the
leaves up over the stuffing. Pour the tomatoes around the cabbage.

Cover and bake 1-1/2 hours.  Remove the string, and cut in wedges to
serve.
