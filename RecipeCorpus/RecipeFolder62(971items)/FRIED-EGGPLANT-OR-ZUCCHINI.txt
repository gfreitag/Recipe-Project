Powdered sugar is optional
Combine seasoning mix ingerdients is a small bowl, mixing thoroughly.
Sprinkle the vegetables evenly with about 1/2 tsp of the mix. Place
the flour in a small bowl and the breadcrumbs in another. Add 1 tsp
of the seasoning mix to the flour and one tsp to the breadcrumbs,
mixing each well. (Use any leftover mix to season other vegetables
before cooking. In a seperate small bowl combine the milk and egg
until well blended. Heat 1 inch oil in a 2 qt. saucepan or deep fryer
to 350 degrees. Just before frying, dredge the chopped vegetables in
the seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Work quickly so flour doesn't
get too moist; it's best to use your hands for this, but a slotted
spoon will do. Then coat well with the milk mixture, then quickly
with the breadcrumbs, shaking off excess. Place the vegetables in hot
oil until dark golden brown, about 2-3 minutes, making sure to
seperate the vegetable pieces as you drop them into the oil. Adjust
heat as necessary to keep at 350 degrees. Drain and serve
immediately. Sprinle lightly with powdered sugar (If desired) Source:
