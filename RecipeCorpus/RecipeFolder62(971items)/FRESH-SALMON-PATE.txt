Title: FRESH SALMON PATE
Categories: Barry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Boned and skinned salmon
1 ts Salt
1 ts Ground white pepper
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground mace or nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground bay leaves
1/2 lb Butter
Fresh lemon juice
Chopped parsley or chives
-for decoration
Check that as many bones as possible really have been removed, then
put the salmon into a large saucepan of cold water with a pinch of
salt and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Bring it to the boil, then turn the heat down and poach gently for 10
to 15 minutes - one large piece of salmon will take longer than a
couple of smaller pieces.

Turn off the heat and allow to cool in the water for another 10
minutes. If the skin is still on, you will find it lifts away
effortlessly at this point.

Put the salmon into a big bowl and mash it with a fork, or use a food
processor. gently melt the butter in a saucepan and add to it all the
other seasonings - the ground bayleaves, white pepper, cloves, mace
or nutmeg and the salt. Stir thoroughly and pour it into the salmon.
If you are using a food processor, give it another quick whizz,
otherwise stir with a fork until it is thoroughly amalgamated.

If you want to serve the salmon pate in slices, spoon the mixture
into a loaf shaped container lined with cling film, otherwise put it
into a round bowl of souffle dish.

Smooth the top and sprinkle with a little parsley or chives for a
lovely contrasting colour, and chill in the fridge for at least four
hours.

Serve with lots of crusty french bread.
