Categories: Fruits, Salads
Yield: 8 Servings
4 c  Shredded cabbage
2    Apples -- sliced thinly
1 cn Pineapple chunks in juice --
Drained
1/2 c  Green grapes
1/2 c  Red grapes
Dressing: -----

1/2 c  Sour cream

1. Shred cabbage very fine, place into covered bowl or plastic bag and
chill. 2. Dressing: Blend together the mayonnaise, sour cream, sugar,
lemon juice, salt, pepper and cinnamon. Chill. 3. Drain pineapple
very well, wash grapes and add to pineapple; chill. Just before
serving, wash, core and slice apples into thin slices, then in half
again. Mix apples alongwith grapes and pineapple into cabbage. Toss
to blend well. 4. Add dressing and toss to coat. Don't add dressing
all at once in case you don't need it all. This is a little different
than the usual coleslaw, but very good and easy to prepare. Prepare
ingredients ahead of time, then put salad together whenever you wish.
