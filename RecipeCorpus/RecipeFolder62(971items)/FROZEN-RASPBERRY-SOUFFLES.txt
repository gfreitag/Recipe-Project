MMMMM--------------------------SOUFFLES-------------------------------
12 oz Package Frozen Raspberries;
-thawed
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
3 lg Egg Yolks
3/4 c  Whipping Cream; chilled
1/4 c  Raspberry Liqueur

Preheat oven to 350øF. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Stir
all the Almond Macaroon ingredients in a medium bowl until smooth.
Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared sheet, spacing 3"
apart. Using wet fingers, flatten each into a 2" round. Bake until
golden brown on edges, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on a rack.
Peel off parchment.

Puree raspberries in a food processor until smooth. Strain to remove
seeds. Cook sugar and water in a heavy saucepan over low heat,
stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil, without
stirring, until mixture registers 238øF. on candy thermometer,
tilting pan slightly to submerge thermometer tip completely, about 8
minutes.

Using an electric mixer, beat egg yolks in a medium bowl until pale
yellow and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted,
about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in hot syrup. Continue beating until
cool. Carefully fold in raspberry puree. Whip cream in large bowl
until stiff peaks form. Fold cream into berry mixture. Spoon 1/3 cup
into 1/2 cup souffle dishes or custard cups.

Pour liqueur into a small bowl. Dip macaroons into liqueur. Place 1
macaroon atop berry mixture in each dish. Divide remaining berry
mixture among dishes, covering macaroons completely. Freeze until
firm, about 5 hours.
