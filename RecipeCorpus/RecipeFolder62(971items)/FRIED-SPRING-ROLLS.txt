Categories: Philippine, Appetizers
Yield: 30 Rolls
3 c  Oil
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 lb Lean pork, ground
1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled, deveined,
-minced
3/4 c  Minced water chestnuts
2    Carrots, minced
1 c  Minced celery
1/2 c  Green onions, cut very fine
2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Salt (optional)
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
Spring roll wrappers, 8" in

Sweet and Sour sauce
In a wok or pan, heat 2 tb oil. Add garlic and stir until fragrant,
about 5 seconds. Add the pork and shrimp and stir-fry for 1 minute.
Add the water chestnuts, carrots, celery, and green onions. Stir-fry
for approximately 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but
still crunchy. Add the soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Stir. Remove from
heat. Drain excess moisture from pan.

To assemble the rolls, place about 1/3 c of the filling on the lower
third of the wrapper. Fold the portion of the wrapper nearest you
over the filling until just covered. Turn the wrapper again to
enclose the filling securely. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with
water or a mixture of cornstarch and water. Fold over the corners and
press down firmly to seal, making an envelope. Moisten the flap of
the envelope with water and turn, rolling firmly into a 1-inch
cylinder. Seal firmly. Set aside, seam side down. Repeat until all
the filling has been used.

Heat oil in a wok to 375 degrees. Place 4 or 5 rolls at a time in the
hot oil. Deep-fry until crisp and golden. Remove with a skimmer and
drain on paper towels. Serve hot with Sweet and Sour sauce.

Rolls may be prepared ahead of time and frozen, then fried when
needed.
