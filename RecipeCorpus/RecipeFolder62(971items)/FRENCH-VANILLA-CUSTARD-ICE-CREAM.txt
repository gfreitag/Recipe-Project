Title: FRENCH VANILLA CUSTARD ICE-CREAM
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 5 Cups
4    Egg yolks
4 c  Whipping cream *
2/3 c  White sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1 tb Vanilla extract
* (2 cups scalded, 2 cups left as is)

1.Beat the four egg yolks with the sugar and salt until thick and pale
yellow.

2.Stir in 2 cups scalded whipping cream.

3.Cook in heavy saucepan or in top of double boiler over _low_ heat,
stirring often (constantly is more like it), until mixture thickens
enough to coat a spoon.

4.Remove mixture from heat and add the vanilla and the remaining 2
cups of whipping cream. Stir well.

5.Cover and chill thoroughly.

6.Freeze according to instructions that come with your machine.

This makes about 5 cups (or a little more) of liquid so if your
machine is small, freeze half at a time. This makes for better
ice-cream because it gets frozen faster and increases in volume at a
much greater rate. Trying to do too much at one time is not worth it.
Haste makes waste usually, but in ice-cream, haste makes less product.

Variations: add melted baker's bittersweet chocolate (4 or 5 cubes
(oz.) to the custard mixture when removed from the heat.

Substituting maple syrup and a tich of maple flavouring and some
broken walnuts makes great maple walnut ice-cream.

As long as the the custard mixture is part of your recipe you can add
(almost) anything you want, ie. flavouring and nuts or chocolate
chips, fresh fruit, etc.
