Title: FRIED FISH WITH GARLIC SAUCE
Categories: Main dish, Fish, Cyberealm
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Fresh Anchovies or Whitebait
1 c  All-purpose Flour
5 tb Cold Water
1 pn Salt
Oil for Frying
MMMMM------------------------GARLIC SAUCE-----------------------------
4 sl Bread, crusts trimmed
(soaked in water for 10 min)
4 cl Garlic,
(peeled and roughly chopped)
2 tb Lemon Juice
4 1/2 tb Olive Oil
1 1/2 tb Water (optional)
Salt and Pepper
2 ts Fresh Parsley, chopped
Lemon Wedges for garnish
1) Sift the flour into a deep bowl with the salt. Gradually stir in
the
water in the amount needed to make a very thick batter.

2) Heat enough oil for frying in a large, deep pan. A deep-sided
saute pan
is ideal.

3) Take 3 fish at a time and dip them into the batter together. Press
their tails together firmly to make a fan shape.

4) Lower them carefully into the oil. Fry in several batches until
crisp
and golden. Continue in the same way with all the remaining fish.

5) Meanwhile, squeeze out the bread and put in a food processor with
the
garlic and lemon juice. With the processor running, add the oil in
a
thin steady stream. Add water if the mixture is too thick and dry.
Add
salt and pepper and stir in parsley by hand. When all the fish are
cooked, sprinkle lightly with salt and arrange on serving plates
with
some of the garlic sauce and lemon wedges.
