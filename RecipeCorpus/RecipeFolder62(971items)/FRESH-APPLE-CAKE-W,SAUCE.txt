<ajoy@CAPECOD.NET> Subject: Re: Looking for Apple Cake recipe Hi! I
have a favorite apple cake recipe...It is taken from the "The
Nashville Cookbook" published in 1977...The recipe was from Eva
Redmon and was distributed at a homecoming in East Tennessee.... I
usually double the recipe, and make extra, because the cake
disappears like magic in a day!!! (with or without company!) I
usually make it without raisins or nuts. Enjoy, Ann
