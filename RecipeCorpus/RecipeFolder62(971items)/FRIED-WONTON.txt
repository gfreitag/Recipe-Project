for 12-15 min. Yield: About 60-70 wonton.
COMMENTS: You may substitute ground turkey for pork in the wonton
filling. However, since turkey is drier and more bland than pork, add
a few more water chestnuts and 1/4 tsp. monosodium glutamate to
enhance flavor and texture. Serve with Sweet and Sour Sauce. Source:
