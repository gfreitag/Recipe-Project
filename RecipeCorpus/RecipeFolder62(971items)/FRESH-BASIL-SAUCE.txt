Categories: Seasonings, Italian, Sauces
Yield: 1 Batch
1/4 c  White wine vinegar or
1/4 c  Basil vinegar
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Shallot; finely chopped
1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
1 tb Fresh basil; chopped
1 c  Unsalted butter
3    Egg yolks; at room temp.

1 ts Fresh basil (up to 2 ts.)

"This buttery egg sauce is fashioned after classical French
bearnaise, but substitutes basil for tarragon."

Boil together first 5 ingredients in a small heavy saucepan until
liquid is reduced to about 2 tb. Remove from heat; set aside.

In a clean saucepan, melt butter; remove from heat when it begins to
bubble.  Meanwhile, place egg yolks in container of blender. Set a
small sieve over opening and pour basil-shallot reduction through
this and into the blender jar.  Press solids with back of a spoon to
extract all juices, then discard solids.

Place blender top on and blend briefly at high speed. Remove small
inner cap from the lid.  With blender running at high speed, add hot
butter in a thin, slow stream. Blend until mixture thickens and
machine begins to sound clogged.  Add salt and chopped basil to taste.

Serve warm.  (To keep ahead of time, place near a warm stove element
or in a pan of warm water.)  Good over grilled hamburgers and baked
potatoes; also delicious with green vegetables, poultry, fish and egg
dishes.

For Bearnaise Sauce:  Substitute tarragon vinegar for basil vinegar
and chopped fresh tarragon for basil.

Yield:  About one cup.
