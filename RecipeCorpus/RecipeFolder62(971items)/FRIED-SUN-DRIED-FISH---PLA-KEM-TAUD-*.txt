The South is known for its abundance of seafood and supplies much of
the seafood of Thailand.  This is one of the many easy but delicious
recipes for simply prepared fish. Sun-dried mackerel is available
already prepared, but its flavor may be too strong for Western
palates. Other fish may be substituted if desired.
~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Rinse the mackerel steaks and dry them thoroughly
with paper towels, removing as much moisture as possible.

Heat the oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Carefully lay the
mackerel steaks onto the oil and fry for 5 minutes on each side, or
until the outside of the fish is golden brown and the inside is hot.

Remove the steaks to a serving dish and scatter the shallots and chili
peppers on top.  Drizzle with lime juice and serve immediately.
