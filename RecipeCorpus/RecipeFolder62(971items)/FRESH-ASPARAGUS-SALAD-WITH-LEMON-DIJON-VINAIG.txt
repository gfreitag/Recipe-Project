Title: FRESH ASPARAGUS SALAD WITH LEMON DIJON VINAIG
Categories: Salads
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 lb Asparagus, tough ends
-removed
1 md Lemon (for both juice and
-peel)
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 tb Corn or canola oil
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 1/2 ts Dijon mustard
1 sl Bacon, cooked until crisp
-and crumbled coarsely
4    Dry-cured black olives,
-pitted
Freshly ground pepper
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the asparagus (cook
until tender but still bright green, 4-5 minutes). Remove with tongs
and immediately plunge into ice-cold water to stop the cooking and
preserve the color. Drain completely and arrange the asparagus on two
salad plates.

Remove half the lemon peel and cut into extremely thin strips. Boil
for 1-2 minutes; drain. Squeeze 3 tablespoons juice from the lemon.
Put the juice and boiled peel in a jar. Add the oils, salt, pepper
and Dijon mustard. Shake vigorously to combine. (This makes 3/4 cup
dressing. Refrigerate the unused portion for future salads.)

At serving time, spoon some vinaigrette over the asparagus. (Never let
asparagus sit in vinegar- or lemon based dressings; it turns an ugly
olive drab.) Sprinkle the crumbled bacon and pitted olives over the
top, along with a grind of pepper.
