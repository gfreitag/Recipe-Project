Title: FRISELLE (RING SHAPED CRISPS)
Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads
Yield: 20 Friselle
1 1/4 ts Dried yeast
1 3/4 c  Warm water
2/3 c  Biga Pugliese or durum flour
-- biga
3 3/4 c  Durum or wholewheat flour
2 1/2 ts Salt
Stir the yeast into 1/2 c warm water & let proof for 10 minutes. Stir
in the rest of the water & the biga. Mix until the starter is broken
up & well mixed.  Add the salt & the flour, 1 c at a time, mixing
until the dough comes together.  Add more water if necessary to
prevent the dough coming away from the bottom of the bowl. Knead on a
very lightly floured board until the dough comes together. Set in an
oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap & let rise until doubled, about 1
1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Shape each
one into a cylinder 8" long & as fat as a thumb by roling it on a
lightly floured work surface with the palms of your hands.  The dough
will be springy & elastic. As you roll each one, cover the others.
Set the rolls onto an oiled baking sheet & connect the ends, forming
rings, about 4" in diameter. Pat the tops so they are level, cover
with a towel & let rise until they are puffy & doubled, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400F.  Bring a large pot of boiling water to a boil.
Put the friselle, two or three at a time, into the boiling water.
Turn them over to submerge both sides, but leave them for only 1 or 2
minutes in all. Remove carefully & drain on paper towels. Set the
friselle on oiled baking sheets & bake for 20 minutes until golden &
toasty. Remove from the oven, let them cool slightly & then cut in
half horizontally. Set them cut side up on the baking sheets. Reduce
the heat to 350F & return the friselle to the oven for 15 minutes,
until crisp & crunchy. Use for bruschetta.
