Title: FROZEN YOGURT
Categories: Yogurt
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Yogurt cheese
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Vanilla
4    Egg whites
1 c  Fresh strawberries, thinly
-sliced
One cup of yogurt makes about 1/2 cup of yogurt cheese. But scientists
don't know how much calcium is lost straining off the whey, so 1/2 cup
yogurt cheese could contain nearly a cup serving's worth of calcium.
The calcium in this recipe is figured according to this formula.

It's easiest to make yogurt cheese from yogurt containing pectin.
These recipes have been analysed using non-fat yogurt. Low-fat yogurt
may be preferable to some taste buds.

To strain, place a colander lined with cheesecloth in a bowl. If the
colander has legs, it can stand right in the bowl. If it doesn't,
rest it on the bowl edge so there is room for the whey to drain off.
Weight the yogurt down with empty glass jars. Straining takes at
least six hours. Don't stop until the remaining cheese is about the
consistency of cream cheese.

Mix yogurt cheese, sugar and vanilla. Whip egg whites until stiff,
fold into yogurt cheese-sugar mix. Fold fruit into mixture. For best
results let the mix stand overmight in refrigerator. Freeze according
to ice cream maker instructions.
