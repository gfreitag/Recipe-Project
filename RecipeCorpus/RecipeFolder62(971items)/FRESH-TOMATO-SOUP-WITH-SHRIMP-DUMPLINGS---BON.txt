FOR SOUP: Chop tomatoes in processor in batches. Heat 1/4 C oil in
heavy large Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add shallots, garlic and
peppercorns; saute until shallots are tender, about 5 minutes. Add
tomato paste; stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes, 1/4 C oil and saffron.
Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add herbs. Simmer 5 minutes. Puree mixture in processor in batches
until almost smooth. Strain through medium sieve into large saucepan,
pressing on solids. Stir in broth. Season with salt and pepper. (Can
be made 1 day ahead. Cover, chill.)

FOR DUMPLINGS: Using on/off turns, coarsely chop shrimp in processor.
Transfer shrimp to large bowl. Stir in corn, flour, yolks, cilantro,
tomato paste, oregano and garlic; mix thoroughly. Season generously
with salt and pepper. Shape mixture by scant tablespoonfuls into 24
balls. Cook dumplings in batches in pot of simmering salted water
until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer
to baking sheet. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover, chill.)

Preheat oven to 450'F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet
over medium-high heat. Add half of dumplings; saute until golden,
about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining
dumplings, adding oil if necessary. Place dumplings on baking sheet.
Bake until heated, about 4 minutes.

Bring soup to simmer. Ladle into bowls. Add 3 dumplings to each bowl.
