Yield: 8 Servings
4 c  Pancake mix

2 ts Vanilla -- optional
1 c  Honey -- or sugar
1 1/4 c  Water
Preparation

mix the pancake mix, cinnamon, raisins, dried apple pieces, almonds,
coconut, and scrambled egg mix. Out into a zip lock gallon bag. Add
Sugar if using it instead of honey.

Peel and shred carrots to approximate 4 cups (a little more or less
does not make much of a difference). Pack carrots into a zip lock bag.

If using oil and honey, pre-measure into a 1pint plastic bottle with
the vanilla.

At the campsite:

If using margarine melt it in a small container made of aluminum foil

Add the oil-honey (if using it), carrots,  and water to the dry mix
and mix well. If there is liquid with the carrots add it to the dry
mix too.

Put into a lightly oiled dutch oven and bake 25-35 minutes with about
20 pieces of charcoal on the top and 10-15 on the bottom. Check after
15-20 minutes.
