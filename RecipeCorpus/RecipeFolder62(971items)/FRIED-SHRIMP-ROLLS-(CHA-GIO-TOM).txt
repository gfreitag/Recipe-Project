And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
great when served alongside Cha Gio. These are *really* good! Prepare
the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.

Set aside.

Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.

Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile. Work with
only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
barely damp cloth to prevent curling.

Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water. Remove and spread
flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
out without touching the other round. The rice papers will become
pliable within seconds.

Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Place 1 shrimp in
the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle. The completed
roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
in the same manner.

Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
often until crisp and golden brown. Drain the rolls on paper towels.
Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.

Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
coriander leaves.

NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.

Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.
