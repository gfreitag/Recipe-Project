Title: FRIED MOZZARELLA CHEESE
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Mozzarella cheese
1/2 c  Flour
3 lg Eggs
1 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
1 pn Salt and pepper
8 oz Marinara sauce,
-chilled
Vegetable oil
Cut the mozzarella into sticks a bit more than about 1/4 inch thick
and about 1 1/2 inches long. Coat the sticks with flour, shaking off
excess. Combine the bread crumbs and seasonings in a flat dish. Beat
the eggs and place in a separate bowl.

Coat the sticks by dipping them in the egg and then in the bread
crumbs. The coating on the first stick should be fairly dry when you
finish the last stick. Repeat with another dip in the egg and then in
the bread crumbs.

Deep-fry the coated sticks in oil for about 3 to 4 minutes until the
coating is cooked. Fry in batches, keeping the finished ones warm in
the oven. Serve with chilled marinara sauce or salsa.

NOTES:

*  Fried mozzarella sticks with marinara -- Use your imagination when
choosing spices. The spices listed here are just a suggestion.

*  Be careful when frying, as some sticks split open when they are
done, leaving lots of cheese in your frying oil. You may need more
egg or bread crumbs, depending on how many sticks you have and how
thick you coat them.

: Difficulty:  moderate (frying skill required).
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
