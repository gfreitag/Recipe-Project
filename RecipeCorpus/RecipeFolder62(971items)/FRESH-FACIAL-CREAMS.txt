** This cream is soothing for simple cases of windburn, sunburn,
insect bites, or poison ivy and it even calms the ravages of air
pollution if you apply it right after clensing. As with the creation
of any creams, remember the lessions learned from making mayonnaise,
slowly, very slowly, add the oil, drop by drop to the wax.

Antiaging Cream: Smooth a bit of this antiwrinkle prep every night
around the tender skin of your face and neck. Combine ingreds in a
class or ceramic bowl and gently whisk until thoroughly combined.
Store in tightly sealed container at room temp. It should last for at
least 1 mo which is about when you will want to make up a new batch.
To Use: Massage into skin around eyes and mouth using a circular and
upward motion. This motion will counteract the natural droop of
gravity.

Soothing Cucumber Cream: Cut cucumber into chunks and puree in food
processor. Strain through strainer lined with cheesecloth. Melt wax in
small bowl in the top of a glass or enamel double boiler over med
heat. As soon as the wax is melted, slowly add oil, stirring gently.
Add strained cucumber and blend thoroughly. Remove the pot from heat
and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let mixtue cool very slowly to
prevent crystals from forming in the wax. Stir mixture once or twice
until cool. When completely cool and smooth, store in airtight glass
container in refrigerator. Will keep 60 days. 4 oz Big Savings Typed
