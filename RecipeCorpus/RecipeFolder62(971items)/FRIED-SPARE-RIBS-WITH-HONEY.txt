Title: FRIED SPARE RIBS WITH HONEY
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 lb PORK RIBS, TRIMMED
3/4 c  SUGAR
1/2 c  VINEGAR
5 tb SOY SAUCE
3 tb SHERRY
4 c  COOKING OIL
1. Cut the ribs between the bones into single pieces. Heat the
sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, and sherry to a boil. Pour over the
ribs and mari- nate for at least one hour.
2. Heat the oil in a large wok. Add the ribs and fry for 5
minutes or until golden brown. Turn off heat and allow to
continue cooking an additional 4 minutes. Remove, drain, and
serve.
The sweet sauce, what we call honey, is our special touch. The
ribs, if prepared perfectly, will be crisp on the outside, sweet
and tender on the inside.
