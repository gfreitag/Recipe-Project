Oil for frying Powdered sugar

Dissolve yeast in the water, add sugar, seasonings, egg, evaporated
milk, oil, and flour.  Beat well until smooth. Cover with plastic
wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled.

Punch down, knead 4 or 5 times, and roll into a long, 18 by-12-inch
rectangle 1/8-inch thick.  Cut into rectangles 3 by 2 inches, cover
lightly with plastic, and let rise again about 20 minutes.

Heat oil in a wok or heavy skillet to 365 F and fry 2 or 3 at a time
until the beignets puff and turn golden brown on both sides. Drain on
paper towels.  Drop them in a paper bag filled with powdered sugar
and shake until coated.  Serve hot.
