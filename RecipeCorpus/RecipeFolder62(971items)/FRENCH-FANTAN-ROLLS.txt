Categories: Desserts
Yield: 48 Servings
1 c  Milk, scalded
1/2 c  Shortening (butter is best)
1/2 c  Sugar (or 1/4 c)
1 ts Salt
2 pk Dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (105-115)
4    Eggs, beaten
1/2 ts Imitation butter extract
-(only if you don't use
-butter)
1/2 ts Lemon extract
6 c  All purpose flour
1/4 c  Melted butter
Combine milk, shortening, sugar and salt stir until shortening melts.
Cool to 105-115.  Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing
bowl. Stir in milk mixture, eggs and flavorings.
Gradually stir in flour to make a soft dough.  Turn dough out onto a
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 5 min. Place
in a well greased bowl, turning to greast top.
Cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts, 1 hr. or until
doubled in bulk. (Watch closely, it usually doubles in no time at
all). Punch dough down and divide in half. Turn dough out onto a
lightly floured board.  Roll each half into a 12 x 6" rectangle.
Brush 2 T butter over top of each.  Cut each rectangle into 6 1"
strips. Stack 6 strips of dough, butter side up on top of one
another.  Cut each stack into 12 pieces about 1" wide.  Place in well
buttered muffin cups sideways.
(cut side down) Cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts
for 30 min.  Bake at 425 for 10-12 minutes.

Makes 48 rolls.
