1.  Chop the grogs' legs into bite-sized pieces and rinse with cold
water to get rid of any pieces of bone. Pat dry and put in the
refrigerator. 2. Combine the lemon grass, chilies, green onion,
garlic, sugar, salt, and 1 tablespoon Nuoc mam sauce in a blender or
food processor until a very fine paste results.  Rub the paste over
the frogs' legs, cover and refrigerate again for 30 minutes. 3. Soak
the vermicelli in warm wate for 30 minutes. Drain and cut into 2 inch
lengths. 4. Heat the oil in a wok over moderate heat. Add the onion
and saute until soft, then add the frogs' legs and brown well,
turning them over from time to time. This should take 3 minutes.  Add
the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and
simmer for 15 minutes. 5. Uncover the wok and add the coconut cream.
Add the cornstarch and the remainng Nuoc Mam sauce. Stir as the sauce
thickens and cook for another 15 minutes. 6. Add the vermicelli and
bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat. Sprinkle with black pepper
and garnish with cilantro sprigs. 7. Serve immediately with rice or
French bread or rice noodles. It is advisable to offfer an
alternative to frogs; legs since there are a few cynics who do not
believe that frogs' legs taste very much like chicken.
