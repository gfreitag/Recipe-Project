Title: FRENCH ONION SOUP (MACRO)
Categories: Mexican
Yield: 1 Servings
5 c  ; water -- or 6 cups
1    Onions; or 3 -- with skins*
1    Clean -- yellow onions with
1    Brown skin
1    Wakame; or kombu -- 3 in
1    Piece
1 tb Oil, corn -- or sesame
1 ts Barley malt
1/4 c  Tamari
2 ts Vinegar, rice
*Peel onions reserving skins. Bring water to a boil. Add onion skins
and kombu. Remove kombu after at least 5 minutes. (I use the wakame
and cut it up finely and put it back in the pot because I want to get
all the sea veg I can).  Let onion skins continue to cook until water
is deep yellow. Slice onions in half moons or dice and saute in oil
until translucent. Add the barley malt.  Saute until lightly browned.
Drain cooking stock and add onion mixture to it. Add the tamari and
rice vinegar. Simmer 10 minutes. Serve with chopped parsley or baked
mochi cubes.

Original Poster's Note: That is the way I got the recipe from Deborah
Kelley on *P.  You know me, I have to add or change. I add a
tablespoon of dark brown miso at the end of cooking. (Do not boil
miso as it destroys some of the enzymes in it.)  That way I get my
miso soup every day. I get a thick slice of sourdough bread and toast
it under the broiler, put it in the soup bowl and ladle the soup over
it.
