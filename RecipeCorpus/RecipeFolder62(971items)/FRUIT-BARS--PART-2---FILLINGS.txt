Using a food processor or a food chopper fitted with a medium blade,
grind together the dried fruit and nuts. Turn into a medium-size pan
and add the sugar, water, lemon or orange peel, lemon juice and
spices (if called for). Place over medium heat and cook, stirring
until mixture boils and becomes very thick (5 to 8 minutes). Mine
never did really "boil", it was more like dry frying. Let cool
completely. Divide the cookie dough into 2 equal portions;
refrigerate 1/2 until ready to use. On a floured surface, roll out
1/2 of the dough to a straight-edged 9 x 15-inch rectangle, cut
lengthwise into three strips. This wasn't that easy to do, that is,
until I figured out that my board was exactly 15-inches wide. I
rolled the dough the width of the board and measured 9-inches across
using my long ruler. I held the ruler against the sides and used my
fingers to press the dough into it. This is the hardest part of
making these cookies. Divide cooked fruit filling into 6 equal
portions (for the apricots it worked out to 1/2 cup per portion) and
evenly distribute one portion down center of each strip, bringing it
out to the ends. Using a long spatula, lift sides of each dough strip
over filling, overlapping edges slightly on top. ****Original Posters
Notes: I found this was hard to do so I cut each strip in half, then
draped the dough over the filling--it never did overlap but that's
OK. Press together lightly. Cut strips in half crosswise (I did that
earlier on); lift and invert onto greased baking sheets (seam side
should be down. Brush off excess flour with a pastry brush.
Refrigerate for about 15 minutes or until the balance of the cookies
are made. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or
until browned. Let cool on baking sheets on a rack for about 10
minutes; then cut each strip crosswise into 4 pieces. Transfer
cookies to racks and let cool completely. Store covered. The cookies
keep well, becoming softer and more flavorful after they have stood
at least 1 day. MAKES 4 DOZEN Food & Wine RT [*] Category 4, Topic 3
