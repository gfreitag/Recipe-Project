*To make basic sugar syrup, combine 1 cup sugar with 1/2 cup water in
a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and stir until all the
sugar is dissolved and the mixture is clear. Cool before using. Makes
1 cup.

In a wide - mouth jar, pour the vodka over the oranges, lemon and
cloves so that the vodka completely covers the fruit. Seal tightly
and let sit in a cool, dark place for 10 days. Strain through a paper
coffee filter and discard the solids. Add sugar syrup. With a funnel,
pour the liqueur into gift bottles and close tightly with corks or
screw - on caps. Let sit for 3 to 4 weeks before using.

Note: The prep time does not include the 5 1/2 weeks necessary for the
liqueur to steep and mature.
