In a bowl, cover bay leaves with water; let soak for 30 minutes. If
using wooden skewers for the souvlaki, soak four 10inch skewers in
water as well. With the side of a chef's knife, mash garlic with
salt. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk in lemon juice, wine,
oregano, oil and pepper. Measure out 3 tablespoons and reserve for
basting. Place tuna in a shallow glass dish and pour the remaining
marinade over it, turning to coat. Cover and marinate in the
refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes, turning often.

Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill.

Thread the marinated tuna onto skewers, placing a soaked bay leaf
between each piece of fish. Grill the souvlaki, covered, turning
several times and basting the browned sides with the reserved
marinade, until the tuna is opaque in the center, 8 to 12 minutes.
Serve with lemon wedges.
