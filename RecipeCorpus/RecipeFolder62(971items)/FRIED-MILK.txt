Title: FRIED MILK
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
3 1/2 c  Milk
1    Vanilla bean
5 1/2 tb Granulated sugar
1    Egg
4 1/2 tb All-purpose flour
4 1/2 tb Cornstarch
1 c  All-purpose flour
3    Eggs, beaten
2-3 TBSP vegetable oil for
Frying
Ground cinnamon and powdered
Sugar for dusting
In a large pot with heavy bottom, heat the milk with the vanilla bean
just until it starts to boil. Remove from the heat and set aside. In
a medium bowl, beat the sugar and 1 egg with a wooden spoon until
well blended. Add the 4 1/2 TBSP flour and the cornstarch; mix well.
Remove the vanilla bean from the milk and bring to a boil. Remove
from the heat and slowly add the milk to the flour mixture, stirring
all the while. Pour the mixture back into the pot and bring to a boil
again; stir constantly as you let it boil until it begins to thicken
a bit (about 6 to 8 minutes). WATCH CAREFULLY SO IT DOES NOT BURN.
Pour into a small greased baking dish or metal try. The mixture
should be about 3/4 inch deep. Cool in the refrigerator. Cut into
3-inch squares. Put 1 cup flour in a shallow bowl and the 3 eggs in
another. Pass the squares through the beaten eggs; gently fry on both
sides in vegetable oil until golden. Place in the middle of a metal
dish, sprinkle with cinnamon and powdered sugar and serve warm. (This
is a specialty of Spain) (From Mike Kalina's Traveling Gourmet
