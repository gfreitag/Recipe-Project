Title: FRESH HERB JELLY
Categories: Native amer, Southwest
Yield: 32 Ounces
2 c  Water
3/4 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 pk Powdered pectin (1 3/4 oz)
4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Fresh chives, finely chopped
1/4 c  Fresh thyme leaves, finely
-chopped
1/4 c  Fresh oregano leaves, finely
-chopped
1/4 c  Fresh basil leaves, finely
-chopped
1/4 c  Fresh tarragon leaves,
-finely chopped
In a large saucepan, stir together the water, lemon juice and powdered
pectin.  Scrape the sides of the pan to make sure all the pectin has
dissolved.

Place the saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Stir
constantly to prevent scorching.  Add the sugar and herbs while
stirring. Bring the mixture to a full, rolling boil 4 minutes, then
remove from the heat. Skim the foam off the top of the mixture and
pour into clean, sterilized jars. Seal with parrafin, if desired, and
allow to set overnight.

*** NOTE *** If the herb jelly does not set overnight, remove the
parrafin and reheat the mixture over high heat. Bring to a hard
rolling boil 2 minutes, repour into the jars, and reseal. Because you
are working with herbs and not fruit, sometimes the pectin doesn't
react the first time and needs to be reboiled.
