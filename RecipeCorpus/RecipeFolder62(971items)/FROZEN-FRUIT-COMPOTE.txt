1 lb Frozen, unsweetened
-blackberries
1 c  Granulated sugar, or less to
-taste, divided
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch

In a large bowl, combine strawberries, blueberries and blackberries
and 1/2 cup sugar. Let stand at room temperature until the berries
thaw, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally, taste, adding the
remaining sugar if necessary. In a large colander, strain the berries
with a bowl under it so you can save the juice. Place the cornstarch
in a medium saucepan and stir in the juice. Turn on the heat to
medium and cook, stirring, until the juice becomes thick and
translucent, about 10 to 15 minutes. Let it cool. Place the berries
in an attractive bowl. Pour the sauce over the fruit. Add the oranges
and stir gently. Cover and chill until serving time.
