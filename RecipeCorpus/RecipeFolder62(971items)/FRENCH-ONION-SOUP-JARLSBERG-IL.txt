Title: FRENCH ONION SOUP JARLSBERG IL
Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Butter, light
1 tb Fructose
1 c  Wine, white zinfandel
1/2 ts Pepper, ground, fresh
8 oz Jarlsberg cheese, sliced
1    Paprika
4 lg Onions, spanish or
8 md Onions, vidalia
1 tb Flour
3 cn Beef broth
1    Bread, french, dried
1 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1 c  Swiss cheese, grated
In a large, heavy dutch oven melt the light butter slowly.  When
melted, add the sliced onions, and fructose (normal table sugar may
be used if desired.)  Cover, and cook - stirring often - until the
onions are tender but colorless.

Take the top off the pan, turn the heat up to high - then cook
:
the onions until the sugar caramalizes on them turning them a golden
caramel color.

Stir in the flour and make a roux.  Blend well and cook over
:
medium heat for three minutes until the starchy flavor of the flour
is cooked out.

Carefully add the wine and pepper to the onions with stirring
:
over high heat until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.

Pour in the beef broth and bring to a boil.  When the soup
:
begins to boil, cover, reduce heat - and simmer for twenty minutes so
the flavors have time to blend.

To prepare for table, ladle the soup into small fire proof
:
crocks or broiler safe bowls.  Float slices of dried French bread in
the bowls then add a 1/4 c of each of the grated cheeses topping it
all off with a slice of Jarlsberg cheese. Let the slices overlap the
sides of the bowl slightly the toasted cheese that runs over the side
is a delicacy for most french onion soup lovers!

Place the crocks under your broiler and watch carefully as the
:
cheese on top melts, bubbles and begins to turn a rich dark brown on
top of the bubbles.

When you see the bubbles browing - your done.  Enjoy!
