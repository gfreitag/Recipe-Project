Title: FRIED FISH
Categories: Seafood, Mrs. g, Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
G GRANAROLI   (XBRG76A)
Pancake mix, complete
Water
Oil
Fish fillets
Add enough water to some pancake mix to make a somewhat thick batter.
Heat some oil in a frying pan until hot but not smoking. Dip the
fillets into the batter and right into the hot oil. By the time the
outside is crispy and golden the inside will be done. It only takes
about 1-2 min. on each side. Drain well on paper towels and serve
with a tarter sauce or a hot cocktail sauce or, do what I do and
serve both!
