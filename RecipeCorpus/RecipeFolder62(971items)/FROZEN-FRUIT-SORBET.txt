Title: FROZEN FRUIT SORBET
Categories: Digest, July, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Fruit
Hi, Patti and all!  Yes, I am the original poster of the "frozen
fruit in a can" sorbet.  (For those of you newbies who missed it:
Take a can of fruit in its juice [peaches, pineapple, etc.], freeze
it, open can and dump or push* contents into food processor and
process til smooth. That's it!) Since Patti brought up the can
freezing question again: aluminum drink cans and steel fruit cans are
not the same! The drink cans are made of light, flimsy aluminum with
a pre-planned weak spot - the opening. (I bet that's where yours
burst, Patti. That's where mine always have!) Steel fruit cans are
much sturdier and I'VE never had one burst in the freezer. YMMV. :-)

*open both ends of can and use one end as a plunger to push out the
contents.
