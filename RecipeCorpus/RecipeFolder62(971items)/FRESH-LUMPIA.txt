1 lb Potatoes, cut into cubes
2 lb Pole beans, cleaned and cut
-crosswise
1 bn Lettuce (not iceberg)
2 tb Soy sauce
4 tb Vegetable oil
Salt and pepper
2 tb Fish sauce ("patis"),

2 tb Accent salt, optional
Lumpia wrappers
For the stock, boil the shrimp shells in 1 1/2 cups water. Saute the
garlic, onions, ground port, shrimp, and tofu. Add the potatoes and
1/2 cup stock. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the
beans and cook for another 5 - 10 minutes. Then add turnips, soy
sauce, vegetable oil, salt and pepper (to taste), and fish sauce.
Continue to stir and cook for 5 more minutes. Drain and save the
broth for the dipping sauce. Allow the mixture to cool. Separate the
lumpia wrappers carefully. Line one end of the wrapper with a small
piece of lettuce so that the lettuce pokes out a little bit - this is
the top of the roll. Use 2 tbsp. of the mixture for filling (this
will be a fatter roll than for fried lumpia) on top of the lettuce
and roll the wrapper. Close the bottom end of the roll by folding it
and securing it with a little water. Wrap each roll with wax paper.
Makes 2 dozen, depending on size of roll. Spread garlic sauce (below)
liberally over lumpia. FRESH LUMPIA
