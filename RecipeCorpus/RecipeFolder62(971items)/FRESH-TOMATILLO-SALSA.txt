Title: FRESH TOMATILLO SALSA
Categories: Appetizers, Mexican
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM-----------------ALL QUANTITIES APPROXIMATE----------------------
8    To 16 Tomatilloes depending
On size.
12    Chiles (2_Serranos +
2    _Jalapenos + 8_Piquins) I
Typically use
The serranos and jalapenos
Green and the piquins red.
4    Cloves Garlic
1 sm Onion, really small, or half
Medium onion.
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Cilantro
Roast above ingredients in a[n oil-free] cast iron pan, turning
occasionally.  Leave husks on tomatillos while you roast 'em. The
husks will be nicely blackened, the skins translucent, and the fruits
soft when they're done.  [Let me add: the goal is to blacken the skin
while doing the least tomatillo-exploding that you can. That way they
don't lose juice into the pan, that burns and smells sometimes. That
means moving them around the pan as they roast.] Put roasted
vegetables in food processor with: Salt 1/2 Teaspoon Cilantro 1/4 Cup
and process briefly. Transfer to a pot, and cook the mixture for 5
minutes. [This darkens it up a bit, and mellows the flavors.  It
tastes too raw otherwise.] Source: Actually, my husband is the
green-salsa preparer, so I sent him e-mail at work, requesting the
recipe. Here's the (slightly edited) reply
