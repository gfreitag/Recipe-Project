Categories: Cheese, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 12 Servings
2 3/4 c  Unbleached flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Butter
2 1/2 c  Cheddar; sharp, shredded
2 ea Eggs; lg, beaten
1/2 c  Peach preserves
1/2 c  Strawberry preserves
Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Sift the dry ingredients together
and cut in the butter until the pieces are the size of peas. Add the
cheese and toss lightly. Add the eggs and blend well. Chill one
quarter of the dough. Press the remaining dough into the bottom and
sides of an ungreased 15 1/2 X 10 1/2 X 1/2-inch jelly roll pan.
Spread half the dough with the peach preserves and the other half
with the strawberry preserves. Roll the chilled dough, on a lightly
floured surface, to 1/4-inch thick. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch
strips and place the strips diagonally across the top of the
preserves making a lattice of the strips. Press the ends of the dough
against the side dough to seal. Bake in the preheated oven for 35
minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool before cutting into 2 X
3-inch bars.
