1/3 c  Warm water
2 pk Yeast; not instant
2 c  Milk
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
Recipe by: Jo Merrill Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over warm water;
sprinkle yeast over this. Let stand in warm place until doubled in
size; about 10 minutes Mix milk, remaining sugar, flour and yeast
mixture. Place in a plastic or glass container; about a 5-quart size.
Stir using a wooden spoon or paddle. Do not use metal since it
retards growth. Cover loosely and let stand in a warm place
overnight. The next day, refrigerate. Stir each day with a wooden
utensil.

On the fifth day, measure out 1 cup to bake with and 1 cup for a
friend. Feed the remaining starter 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk and 1/2
cup sugar. Stir well and refrigerate; stir daily.
On the 10th day, measure out 1 cup to give to a friend if desired.
You should have enough left to use in a recipe plus enough to feed as
before; refrigerated.
Thereafter, you can use the starter daily or as desired, feeding
every fifth day.
