Cook's notes: Black-eyed beans may take up to 1 hour to cook. One can
(14 ounces) diced tomatoes with their liquid can be substituted for
the fresh tomatoes. Dried shrimp are available in Asian markets;
small peeled fresh shrimp can be substituted ++ just add them during
the last 5 minutes of cooking. To prevent scorching, we added 1/2 cup
water when adding the cooked beans to the onion mixture. Chopped
fresh cilantro sprinkled over the finished dish is suggested.
Preliminaries: Soak the black-eyed beans overnight in plenty of
water. Procedure: Rinse the beans with fresh water several times then
boil them in a large saucepan, with plenty of salted water. Cook
30-40 minutes or until the beans are soft but not mushy. Drain and
set them aside. In a separate large cooking pot, heat the oil. Fry
the onions until golden, add the tomatoes, turmeric and chiles (hot
peppers) and stir well to prevent burning. Cook about 3 minutes on
medium heat, stirring all the time. Add the fish and prawns (shrimp)
and stir. Lower the heat and cook 3 more minutes. Stir in the cooked
beans and simmer 10-15 minutes. Presentation: Serve with grilled or
fried plantains and boiled "arroz blanco" (white rice). Yield: Makes
4 to 6 servings.Subj: Pargo al Horno a la Viszcaina FRIJOLES NEGROS
