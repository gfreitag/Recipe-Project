COBBLER: Place peaches in greased 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Mix sugar,
cornstarch and salt; sprinkle evenly over peaches. Sprinkle on lemon
juice and almond extract. Dot with butter. Place in preheated, hot
oven (400 degrees) until hot and bubbly, about 15 minutes.

CHEESE BISCUITS: Measure mix into small bowl. Stir in grated cheese.
Add melted butter and enough milk to make soft dough. Stir with fork
until well blended. Remove peach mixture from oven. Stir to mix
sugar. Drop dough onto hot peaches making 12 biscuits. Replace in hot
oven (400 degrees) until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

NOTE: This recipe is excellent with fresh apples using cinnamon
instead of almond extract.
