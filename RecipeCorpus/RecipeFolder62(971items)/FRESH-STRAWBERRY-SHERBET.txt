Title: FRESH STRAWBERRY SHERBET
Categories: Fruits, Froz-dezrt
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pt Strawberries
2 tb Sugar or to taste
1/4 c  Strawberry fruit spread
2 tb Non-fat yogurt
HULL BERRIES and cut in half, if large. Arrange on baking sheet lined
with waxed paper and freeze until solid, about 40 minutes. Once
frozen, they can be used right away or frozen for several months,
stored in an airtight plastic bag. Put frozen berries in food
processor with sugar. Pulse processor on and off several times to
chop berries. Process continuously until berries are minced into tiny
chips, stopping often to scrape down sides of work bowl with rubber
spatula. Remove cover, and add fruit spread and yogurt. Process until
mixture is smooth, about 5-8 minutes, stopping as necessary to scrape
down sides of work bowl. Can be served immediately or frozen. Let
soften slightly before serving. When ice crystals form, let soften
just enough to spoon back into work bowl. Process again, until smooth.

Makes 3 Cups
