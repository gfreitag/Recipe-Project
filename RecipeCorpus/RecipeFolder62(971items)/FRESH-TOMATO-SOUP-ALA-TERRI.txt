Categories: Soups, Kooknet, Cyberealm
Yield: 24 Servings
12 lb Very ripe fresh tomatoes
16 tb Sweet butter
4 tb Olive oil
4    Onion, finely minced
12 tb Flour
16 c  Boiling water
4    Bouquet Garni*
Salt & freshly ground
-white pepper
24 tb Sour cream
8 tb Finely chopped fresh dill
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
8 c  Cooked rice
4 c  Chicken stock
* Bouquet Garni - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
thyme and 1 t fresh marjoram. Leave the string long enough to hang the
garni in the pot and tie the string to the pot handle for easy
removal. Drop the tomatoes into boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and
peel. Chop coarsely and reserve.  In a large saucepan, heat 1 T of
butter and oil. Add the onion and cook over low heat until lightly
browned. Add the remaining butter. When the butter is melted, add the
flour and cook until it is golden brown.  Be careful not to burn it!
Add the chopped tomatoes stirring constantly.  Then add the boiling
water, Bouquet Garni, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer the soup for
35 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat. Remove the Bouquet. Cool
the soup and puree it in the blender. If it seems too thick, thin it
out with a little chicken stock or water. Serve the soup in
individual bowls, each topped with 1 T sour cream and a sprinkling of
dill. Notes: For a hearty soup, omit the sour cream and substitute
cooked rice.  From "Seasonal Kitchen, a Celebration of Fresh Foods"
