STARTER:  Mix water and honey in medium bowl.  Add yeast; stir to
dissolve. Let stand until foamy, 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup rye flour
and 1/2 cup bread flour; stir to combine.  Add remaining 1/2 cup rye
flour. Mix in enough bread flour to form shaggy mass that can be
worked with hands. Turn out starter onto floured surface; knead 3
minutes, adding more bread flour if too sticky to work. (Starter will
be doughlike in texture at this point.) Sprinkle 1 tablespoon bread
flour in medium bowl. Add starter dough to bowl.  Cover with plastic;
let stand at room temperature overnight (starter will lose its shape
and spread to a thick batter).

BREAD: Place 1/4 cup warm water in small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over;
stir to dissolve.  Mix 3 cups bread flour and rye flour in bowl of
heavy-duty mixer fitted with dough hook.  Add yeast mixture and
remainig 2 1/2 cups warm water; mix on low speed to blend. Add 1 cup
bread flour; beat 4 minutes. Add another 1 cup bread flour and beat 4
minutes. Add enough bread flour to form shaggy mass; beat 4 minutes.
Add salt and starter; continue mixing until dough pulls away from
sides of bowl, adding more bread flour if too sticky to form dough,
about 5 minutes.

Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface; turn to coat. Transfer
dough to large bowl.  Cvoer with kitchen towel. Let rise at room
temperature 1 hour.

Generously flour 1 heavy large baking sheet and 1 heavy medium baking
sheet.  Punch dough down.  Turn out onto floured surface. Knead until
smooth, 2 minutes. Divide into 3 equal portions. Shape each into ball.
Place 2 balls on large sheet and 1 on medium sheet. Cover with kitchen
towels.  Let rise at room temperature until doubled (test by pressing
2 fingers gently into dough; if indentations remain, dough has risen
compltely), about 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 450F. Place baking pan in bottom of oven; add water to
create steam.  Using sharp knife, cut 3 diagonal slits across top of
each loaf.  Place baking sheet with 2 loaves in oven. Bake until
breads are deep brown and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about
35 minutes. Transfer to rack.  Place remaining loaf in oven. Bake
until bread is deep brown and souds hollow when tapped on bottom,
about 35 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool.
