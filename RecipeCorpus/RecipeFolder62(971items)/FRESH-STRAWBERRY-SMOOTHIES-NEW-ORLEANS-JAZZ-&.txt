Terry Marks and Joe Gallo are both native New Orleanians. Joe's
family was raised in Independence, Louisiana on their own strawberry
farm. Terry and Joe own and operate GM Signs in Metairie as their
primary business, but look forward every year to getting the
concession trailer ready for the Jazz Fest. Joe's mother Frances and
a host of Joe's aunts, uncles and other relatives and friends work
for many hours before and during the Fest preparing the
chocolate-dipped strawberries. At the Fest, Joe, Terry, their wives
Dale Gallo and Linda Marks, and many friends and relatives work
hauling ice, restocking supplies, making the Smoothies, and serving
customers. In a Vitamix machine or blender, place strawberries, honey
and water. Blend at high speed while adding crushed ice to achieve
desired consistency. Smoothie should be stiff enough to hold a straw,
but still be pourable. It takes a little practice to get it just
right. This will yield 4 to 5 (8 oz.) drinks. Walt MM
