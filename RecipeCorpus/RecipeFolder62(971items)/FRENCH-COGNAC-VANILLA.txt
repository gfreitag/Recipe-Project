Title: FRENCH COGNAC VANILLA
Categories: Sauces, Mixes, Seasonings
Yield: 1 Bottle
759 ml Bottle of French cognac
9    Vanilla beans
Cut vanilla beans in half, crosswise.  Split beans open and scrape
seeds out.  Add beans and seeds to cognac. Let set for at least 2
months, shaking bottle frequently. It will still have more of the
cognac smell than it does a vanilla odor.  The flavor cooks into the
food as it bakes. This is very expensive and very good. You can buy
American cognac which is much cheaper, but the results are not as
good.
