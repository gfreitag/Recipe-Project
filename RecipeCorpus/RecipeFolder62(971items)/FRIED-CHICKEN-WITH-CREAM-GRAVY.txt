Title: FRIED CHICKEN WITH CREAM GRAVY
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Milk
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Garlic salt
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Black pepper
1/4 ts Poultry seasoning
3 lb Frying chicken cut up
3 c  Shortening or oil
1 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Milk
COMBINE MILK AND EGG in medium bowl. Combine flour, garlic salt,
paprika, pepper and poultry seasoning in paper or plastic bag. Add a
few pieces of chicken at a time, and shake to coat. Dip chicken in
milk-egg mixture, then shake a second time in flour mixture. Reserve
remainder of the flour. Heat 1/2 to 1 inch of shortening or oil to
365F in electric skillet or on medium-high in a large heavy skillet.
Brown chicken on all sides. Reduce heat to medium low or 275F.
Continue cooking until chicken is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Turn chicken several times during cooking, and drain on paper towels
in a single layer. To make the gravy, pour all but 2 tablespoons of
the fat from the skillet. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the reserved
seasoned flour, and stir constantly over low heat for 2 minutes.
Whisk in the chicken stock, stirring to scrape up the brown bits on
the bottom of the pan. Then stir in the milk and bring to a boil over
high heat, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer
for 5 minutes. Serve immediately, passing the gravy separately.
