Place vegetable oil in a deep saute pan to come no more than 1/3 of
the way up the sides of the pan. Heat oil until a deep fat fry
thermometer registers 360 degrees. Meanwhile, over an open flame,
carefully char the peppers until the skin blisters and blackens. Set
aside to cool. When the peppers are cooled, remove the seeds and
slice into thin strips. Now, in a large non-stick skillet, heat 3
tablespoons of oil, add onion and cook until softened. When the oil
is heated, carefully drop the potatoes into the pan, cook, stirring
for 5 minutes or until tender, golden brown and crispy. Cook the
potatoes in batches. Drain well on paper towels and add to the pan
with the onions. Then, add the pepper strips, and season with salt
and pepper. Finally, top with the cheese and cook for 1 minute.
Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately.
