Title: FRESH PASTA
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2    Eggs
Place flour in work bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade.
Add eggs and process until dough comes together and forms ball that
rides around on top of blade. If mixture is too dry and fails to form
ball, slowly add just enough water to bring ball together, no more
than 1 tablespoon.

Dough ball should be slightly sticky. If too sticky and soft, add
flour 1 teaspoon at time until texture is correct.

Knead dough by running processor. Ball with ride around on top of
blade, becoming more and more smooth. When smooht enough, remove from
processor. Wrap in plastic wrap. Let stand at least 45 minutes.

Roll dough out in pasta machine. Divide in quarters and work with 1
portion at time, keeping remainder wrapped in plastic wrap. Flatten
dough, then run through machine on widest setting. Fold double and
run through again, folded edge first. Repeat 2 or 3 times. Fold
double again, and run through sideways. Repeat 2 or 3 more times.
Dough will change from fairly sticky and possibly slightly dimpled on
1 side to satiny and smooth. Sheet should be as wide as baking dish
(if not, layer dish with 2 sheets rather than 1).

Change pasta machine to next-narrower setting. Run dough through
machine once. Repeat until next-to-last setting. Before rolling out
at next-to-last setting, cut pasta sheet in half. After rolling out
at next-to-last setting, lay pasta sheet on lightly floured dish
towel and cover with another dish towel.

Repeat until all dough has been rolled out.
