Roast the anaheim chiles, then peel, seed and dice them. Process the

Scrape down with a spatula and process for another minute. In a bowl,
mix together the corn puree,the chopeed chiles, salt, and pepper.
Slowly add the flour, small amounts at a time, while stirring. In a
medium saucepan, heat the clarified butter over high heat. Using a
large cook's spoon or serving spoon, gently drop spoonfuls of the
batter into the hot butter. When the edges are brown after about 2
minutes, turn the fritters over and cook another 2 minutes. Remove
the fritters and allow them to drain on paper towels. In another
saucepan over medium high heat, melt the unsalted butter, add the
apples and the celery seed, and saute about 3 minutes, until they
begin to soften. Serve hot with the fritters.
