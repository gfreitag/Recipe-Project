OYSTERS-----
~----------------SAUCE-------------------------- Cook cream in heavy
large saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, stirring
occasionally, about 20 minutes. Set aside. Julienne the chili, red
pepper and onion. Scrape kernels off the ear. Melt butter in heavy
medium skillet over low heat. Add chili, bell pepper, onion, corn and
garlic and saute until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Transfer
vegetables to bowl. Add tiquila to skillet and bring to boil,
scraping up any browned bits. Mix in reduced cream, vegetables, chili
powder and cumin. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne and simmer
until thickened to sauce consistency, about 5 minutes. Keep warm in
top of double boiler over warm water. Heat oil in deep fryer or large
skillet to 375 F. Combine masa mix, flour and 2 1/2 Tbsp. Brennan's
Cajun Seasoning Mix in medium bowl. Dredge oysters in mixture. Add
oysters to oil in batches and fry until golden brown, about 1 minute.
Transfer to paper towels using slotted spoon and let drain. Serve,
passing sauce separately. Brennan's Restaurant, Houston Bon Appetit
