Title: FRESH BLACK PEPPER PASTA
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Pound
2 c  All-purpose flour
2    Eggs at room temperature
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Olive oil
4 tb Water
1    Heaping tablespoon finely
Ground fresh pepper
Put the flour on a flat surface and shape it into a mound. Make a
well in the center and add the eggs, salt, olive oil, 2 tablespoons
water, and the ground pepper. (Be sure when you grind the pepper that
it isn't too large or it will tear the pasta.)  Mix with a wooden
spoon by combining the eggs and the flour with a circular motion,
taking some flour from the inside of the well.  Add the remaining
water and mix until it comes together. Transfer the dough onto a
floured board and knead it for 10 minutes. Work the dough into a
ball, cover it with a bowl, and let it rest for 15 minutes. Roll the
dough (using more flour, if needed) into a cylinder about 6 inches
long and slice into 1-inch pieces. Flatten each piece of dough with a
rolling pin or the palm of your hand. Roll dough out on a pasta
machine.
