1 c  Tasso Hollandaise Sauce, --
hot, recipe follows
:
2 TB chopped chives

Preheat the fryer. Marinate the soft-shells in the hot sauce for 20
minutes. Remove the soft-shells from the sauce. Stuff each soft-shell
with about 1/4 cup of the Crawfish Mash Potatoes. **Place the
stuffing in the soft pocket above the body of the soft-shell. Season
the flour and bread crumbs with Essence. In a small mixing bowl,
whisk the eggs and milk together. Season the mixture with Essence.
Dredge the soft-shells in the flour. Dip the soft-shells in the egg
wash, letting any excess drip off. Dredge the soft-shells in the
bread crumbs, coating each side completely. Hold the body of the crab
with the claw and legs hanging down over the hot oil and carefully
drop it in. Fry until golden brown, flipping the crabs with tongs 2-3
times to brown evenly. The crabs will float to the surface of the oil
when they are cooked. Remove from the fryer and drain on paper-lined
plate. Season the crabs with Essence. Mound the spinach in the center
of the plate. Lay the crabs on top of the spinach. Spoon the
Hollandaise over the crabs and around the plate. Garnish with chives
and peppers.
