Frozen bread loaf
Grease
Use slow cooker to thaw and raise bread. It gives it a beautifully
brown crusty round loaf. Generously grease frozen bread loaf. Place
in completely greased baking pan. Place pan in pot, cover and heat on
low 2 to 3 hours, or until bread is thawed and starting to rise. Turn
to high and bake 2 to 3 hours or until it is brown and tests done.
