Title: FRIED CORNMEAL MUSH WITH TOMATO GRAVY
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 c  Stone ground yellow cornmeal
1 c  Cold water
3 c  Hot water
1 ts Salt
Vegetable oil for frying
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
Flour for dredging

In a small bowl, combine the cornmeal, salt, and flour. Gradually
whisk the cold water into the mixture. Bring the hot water to a boil
in a large saucepan over high heat and gradually whisk in the
cornmeal mixture. Stir and whisk until it boils. Cover, lower heat,
and simmer for 5 minutes. The mixture will be very thick.  Pour into
an oiled 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, cut the loaf into 1/2 inch slices.  In a skillet, heat 2
teaspoons of oil or bacon fat.  Dredge 3 or 4 slices in the flour and
fry them over low heat until golden brown on both sides. Continue to
cook remaining mush, adding oil to the skillet as needed. Serve with
either maple syrup or Tomato Gravy and plan on 3 to 4 slices per
person.
