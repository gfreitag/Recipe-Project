Title: FRIED GARLIC CHICKEN BALLS
Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Ground chicken meat
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Dark soy sauce
2    Egg whites
1/2 ts Freshly grated ginger
2 tb Dry sherry
4    Cloves garlic, crushed
Coating:
1 c  Cornstarch
1 c  Water-chestnut flour
4 c  Peanut oil for deep frying
Mix the chicken with all of the seasonings and egg whites. Mix it very
well.  Form into balls about the size of large walnuts and set on
waxed paper.  When all are formed, mix the cornstarch with the
water-chestnut flour and roll each ball in this mixture. Deep fry in
several batches in 360 degree oil until the balls float and are
golden brown in color, about 5 minutes.  Taste one to be sure they
are done to your liking. From The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient
