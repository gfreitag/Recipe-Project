bottom and sides with greased waxed paper, allowing paper to stand 1"
above sides of pan. Sift flour, salt, Mixed Spice, ginger and baking
soda into a bowl. In a saucepan, combine corn syrup, molasses,
margarine and brown sugar and heat gently until melted. Stir into
flour mixture and add eggs and milk. Stir until evenly mixed.

Pour into prepared pan and bake in preheated oven 45-50 minutes or
until well risen and baked through. Cool in pan, turn out and remove
waxed paper. To make icing, put cream cheese into a bowl and soften

using a fork, to make a soft creamy mixture. Spread icing over cold
cake. Using blade of a knife, form a rippled effect on icing.
