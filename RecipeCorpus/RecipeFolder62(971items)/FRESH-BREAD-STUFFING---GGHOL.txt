Break up bread into bite sized chunks into large bowl. Diced and cook
bacon until not quite crisp, saving bacon grease. Chop onion and
celery and add to stuffing mixture. Add bacon and pour grease over
top of mixture. Add eggs, spices, butter and mix together. Use a bit
of warm water as needed in order to bind the mixture together until
it holds its own shape.

Rinse turkey and salt the inside.  Loosely pack the inside of turkey
with stuffing. Dry off the outside of the turkey by blotting it with
paper towels. Use additional butter to lightly coat the outside and
top of bird, lightly salt and pepper, and then cook according to
directions. (20 per lb)

If you are lucky enough to have stuffing left over, shape into balls
to place beside the turkey when it has about 1-1/2 hours left to bake.
