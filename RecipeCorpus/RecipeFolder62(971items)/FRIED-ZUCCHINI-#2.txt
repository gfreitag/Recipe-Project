Title: FRIED ZUCCHINI #2
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Zucchini,
1/4" slices, crosswise
(other veggies in pieces,
If desired, such as
Mushrooms, onion rings,
Eggplant slices,
Cauliflower)
2    Leaves of fresh basil,
Very coarsely chopped
1 md Red onion,
Sliced very thin
1 c  Grated Parmesan
Or
Romano cheese, grated
Vegetable oil for frying
1 c  Flour
1    Egg
3/4 c  Milk (or more if needed)
2 ts Garlic salt
Dash of black pepper
Mix together the flour, egg, milk and seasonings and whisk together.
The batter should be the consistency of a medium thick pancake
batter. Pour enough oil into a heavy fry pan to a depth of about 1/2"
and heat to high. Dip the slices of zucchini in the batter to fully
cover each slice and drop gently into the hot oil. Fry on each side
to a golden brown, drain for a few minutes on a paper towel and set
in a baking dish in layers. In between each layer sprinkle some
Parmesan cheese, spread a few rings of the onion slices and sprinkle
a little of the basil leaves. Cover with foil as you fry the
remaining zucchini to keep warm and lightly steam. Serve immediately.
