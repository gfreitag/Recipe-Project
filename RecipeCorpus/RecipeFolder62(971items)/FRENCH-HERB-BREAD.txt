In a large mixer bowl, combine 2 cups flour, yeast and 3 teaspoons
dry salad dressing mix.  Reserve remaining mix. Heat buttermilk,
water and shortening until warm (120-130~), shor- tening need not
melt. Add to flour mixture.  Add egg.  Blend until moistened; beat 3
minutes at medium speed.

Gradually add enough flour to make a firm dough. Knead on a well
floured surface until smooth and elastic (5-10 minutes). Place in
greased bowl; turn to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm oven (turn
on lowest setting for 1 minute, then turn off) for 20 minutes.

Punch down dough; divide into 2 parts.  On lightly floured surface,
roll or pat each part to a 12x7 inch rectangle. Star- ting with
longer side, roll up tightly sealing edges and ends. Place seamside
down on greased cookie sheet.  Make diagonal slashes about 2 inches
apart in tops of loaves. Cover; let rise in warm oven until light and
doubled, about 30 minutes.

Bake in preheated 375~ oven for 25 to 30 minutes.
While warm, brush with melted butter; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon
reserved salad dressing mix. Cool on wire racks.
