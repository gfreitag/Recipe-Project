Categories: Wildgame, Side dish
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk

chopped shallots *Option subst beer for milk Add ingredients to make
a batter. Heat deep frying oil to 400 degrees. Dip or roll batter
into quail-egg sized balls and drop into hot oil. Cooking time is
short, usually just 4 or 5 minutes. Too cool oil will cause slow
cooking and greasy, soggy hushpuppies. Too hot oil will result in
crisp brown coat with soft uncooked center. Suggestions: Some people
add crumbled-up crisp bacon bits. Recipe date: 11/29/87
