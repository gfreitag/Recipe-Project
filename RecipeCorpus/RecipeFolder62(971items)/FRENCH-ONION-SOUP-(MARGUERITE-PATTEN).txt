Cut the onions into thin rings, then halve these so they are easier
to eat. Crush the garlic clove. Heat the margarine in a saucepan,
then add the onions and garlic and cook steadily for about 10
minutes, or until the onions are

golden in colour. Stir well so these do not burn. Add the flour,
blend with the onions then pour in the stock or water. Bring the
liquid to the boil add the stock cube, if using this a little
seasoning and the sugar. Cover the pan and simmer gently for 20 to 25
minutes, or until the onions are tender. Spoon into individual soup
bowls, top with the bread or toast and cheese. Serve at once or place
under the grill for 1 to 2 minutes only to melt the cheese. Do not
leave for too long a period, otherwise the cheese becomes ` stringy'.
