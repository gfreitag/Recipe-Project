Bring 2 quarts of water to boil in a large soup pot.
Place the whole tomatoes in the water and cook for one minute.
Drain, and when the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, slip the
skins off; chop tomatoes, and set aside.

Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons water in a large soup pot. Add
the onions, garlic and celery and saute over moderate heat, stirring
frequently, unti the onion just begins to turn golden. Add 3 cups of
water and bring to a boil, then simmer over moderate heat, covered,
until the onions and celery are quite tender, about 15 minutes. Add
the tomatoes, basil, oil and mustard. Simmer for 10 minutes more.
Remove from the heat. Stir in the tomato juice and lemon juice and
season to taste with salt and pepper (salt carefully--you may not
need any at all if the tomato juice is salted). Allow the soup to
cook to room temperature, then puree in batches in a food processor
or blender untilsmooth. Chill before serving.

Just before serving, combine all the ingredients for the crunchy
vegetable garnish ina small mixing bowl.
Ladle the chilled tomato soup into bowls and divide the garnish over
the top of each.
