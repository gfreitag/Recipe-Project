Title: FRENCH HERB BLEND
Categories: Condiments, Herbs
Yield: 2 Cups
1/2 c  Tarragon
1/2 c  Chervil
2 tb Sage leaves
1/2 c  Thyme
2 tb Rosemary
5 tb Chives (freeze-dried),
-chopped
2 tb Orange rind,
-desiccated
2 tb Celery seed, ground
Dump everything together and mix until well-combined. Pack into small
jars and label (the now-empty spice jars that held the ingredients
are a good size). Store in a cool dry place. Crumble spices in hand
when using. Measure spices by volume, not by weight, because of the
large variation in moisture content.

NOTES:

*  A French-style mixture of herbs and seeds -- I found this in some
magazine many many years ago. I usually make it every year or so and
give it  to people as presents. The recipients are continually asking
either for the recipe or refills. This goes well in soups and similar
things but is especially good in scrambled eggs.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
