Put the prunes, currants, raisins, and apricot halves in a bowl and
pour the bourbon over the fruit.  Cover bowl and soak overnight. If
you are using salted macadamia nuts and salted cashews, put them in a
strainer and remove salt by rinsing them under cold water. Dry on
paper towels. Heat 2 tbsp. vegetable oil in a skillet and add the
nuts. Toast them, stirring constantly, until golden. Combine the
apples, onions, and celery in a large skillet along with the butter.
Cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the
onions are soft and celery is tender, about 11 minutes. Transfer the
onion mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add the macerated fruit and all
remaining ingredients. Gently mix the stuffing with 2 large spoons
until evenly blended. Set aside the stuffing while you prepare the
turkey for roasting.  Stuff turkey 3/4 full and roast according to
size. (for a 20 lb. turkey, approx. 9 cups)
