Title: FRIED FISH WITH BEER BATTER
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb White fish fillets
Oil for deep frying
1    Egg
1 c  Lager beer
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Black pepper
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
Put oil in dutch oven or other deep pot to a depth of at least 3".
Set over medium-high flame. Cut fillets into pieces about 2"x4". In a
bowl, mix egg, beer and 2 TBL oil together. Stir in flour and spices.
Mix until batter is smooth; it should be a little runny. When oil is
hot (350-360F degrees), dip fish into batter with tongs or fingers,
allowing excess batter to drip back into the bowl. Gently place fish
in the oil and cook until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.
Do not crowd fish; cook in batches. Drain on paper towels and serve
immediately. HINTS Use dark beer for stronger flavor. Don't skimp on
oil, and use a large pot, not a skillet. Use a skimmer between
batches to remove burned bits of batter. Pat fish dry before dipping
into the batter.
