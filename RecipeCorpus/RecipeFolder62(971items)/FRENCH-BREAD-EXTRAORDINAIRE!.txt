1.Place dough ingredients in bread pan, select Dough setting, and
press Start 2. When the dough cycle ends, the machine will beep. Set
a timer and allow the dough to rise 1 more hour. Open the machine,
punch down the dough, set the timer again and let dough rise another
hour in the machine. Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan, and
turn out dough onto a lightly floured countertop or cutting board.
Form into a smooth round ball then flatten it with your hands. 3.
Place a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) in a round wicker
basket that's at least twice the size of the dough. Dust the towel
liberally with flour. Place the round dough in the center of the
basket. Place basket in a warm place and let dough rise, uncovered,
about 45 minutes until double in size. 4. Gently turn dough out of
basket upside down onto a greased baking sheet. With a very sharp
knife held almost parallel to the loaf, carefully slash the top of
the dough at sharp angles in a # pattern. 5. Preheat oven to 450F.
Place a small pan on the floor or bottom shelf of the oven and
carefully add at least 1 cup boiling water to the pan. Place dough in
oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and place on cake rack
to cool 1 hours before slicing. To preserve the crisp crust, do not
store in plastic wrap or bag. Bread can be loosely covered or left
out for up to two days before it dries out completely. From THE BREAD
