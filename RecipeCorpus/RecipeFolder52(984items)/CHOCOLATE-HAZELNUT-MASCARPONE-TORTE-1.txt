Note: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 F.
Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 12 to 15
minutes, or until golden beneath the skins. Wrap the nuts in a clean
towel and cool completely. Transfer the cooled hazelnuts to a large
sieve and rub them back and forth to remove the loose skins. Make the
chocolate butter cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and
preheat to 375 F. Line the bottom of a 17 1/2-by-11 1/2-inch jelly
roll pan with parchment or waxed paper. Lightly spray the bottom and
sides of the pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk
together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Sift the
flour mixture onto a piece of waxed paper and set aside. In a 4
1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle
attachment, beat the butter at medium-high speed for 1 minute, until
creamy. While continuing to beat the butter, gradually add the
granulated and brown sugars, stopping the machine and scraping down
the side of the bowl as necessary. Beat the butter/sugar mixture at
medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one
at a time, and the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and alternately
add one-third of the reserved dry ingredients and one-third of the
coffee. In two more batches, alternately add the remaining dry
ingredients and coffee, scraping down the bowl as necessary. Scrape
the batter into the prepared pan and, using a metal cake spatula,
smooth the batter evenly into the pan. Bake the cake for 25 to 28
minutes, until the sides just begin to pull away from the pan and the
surface springs back when lightly touched. Cool the cake in the pan
set on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto a wire rack;
carefully peel off the parchment paper and allow the cake to cool
completely. Continued..........
