Title: CHOCOLATE BUTTER GLAZE
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Semisweet chocolate
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
3 oz Unsalted butter -- (6
Tablespoons)
Chop the chocolate into matchsticksize pieces with a chef's knife on
a dry cutting board. Place first the butter, then the chocolate
pieces in the top portion of a 1 1/2 quart double boiler (or a 1
quart mixing bowl that fits snugly over a saucepan or another mixing
bowl). Fill the bottom vessel half full with hot tap water (120130
degrees) and place the chocolate/butter bowl on top to melt. You may
put the double boiler on the stove over a very low flame just to
maintain the water's temperature while melting the mixture if you
wish. Stir occasionally to blend until the mixture is smooth, shiny
and liquid. Remove from the water, and set aside. Yield: one scant cup
