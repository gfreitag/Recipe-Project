Title: CHOCOLATE SPREAD
Categories: Diabetic, Sauces
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
1/4 c  Unsalted Butter;
3 tb Cocoa powder;
1/4 c  Lowfat cream cheese;
4 tb 6 tb artificial sweetener;*
Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Add the cocoa and cook,
stirring, for 3 minutes over low heat. Remove from the heat and leave
to cool for 5 minutes. Stir cheese into the cocoa, then mix in the
artificial sweetener to taste. Chill the chocolate spread in a
covered container and it will keep for about 3-5 days in the
refrigerator, depending on the shelf life of the cheese.

*This works very well but it important to avoid sweeteners containing
saccharine as they make the spread very bitter.
