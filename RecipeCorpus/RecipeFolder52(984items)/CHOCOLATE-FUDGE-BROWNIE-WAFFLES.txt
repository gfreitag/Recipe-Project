Preheat waffle iron. Preheat oven to 250=F8F (120=F8C). In a small,
heavy saucepan or double boiler melt chocolate and butter over low
heat.

In a medium-size bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda,
granulated sugar and cocoa powder. In a large bowl beat together egg
yolks, milk, sour cream and vanilla. Gradually stir in flour mixture
and melted chocolate and butter. Beat until smooth. Stir in walnuts.
In a small bowl whip egg whites until soft peaks are formed. Fold
into batter. Batter will be thick. Lightly brush hot grids with
shortening or oil. Pour enough batter to fill two-thirds of the
waffle iron. Push batter out to the edges with a wooden spoon. Cook
until crisp and a dark rich brown. Be careful not to overcook. Keep
finished waffles warm in the oven on a rack until ready to serve.
Repeat with the remaining batter.

To serve cut waffles into quarter sections. Sprinkle powdered sugar
through a fine sieve over the top.

Makes about 3 waffles or 4 servings.

Serve with powdered sugar or with ice cream, Chocolate Fudge Sauce and
whipped cream.
