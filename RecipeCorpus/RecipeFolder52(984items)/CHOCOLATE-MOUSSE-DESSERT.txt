Title: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE DESSERT
Categories: Chocolate, Mousses
Yield: 1 Servings
Chocolate Mousse-----
6 oz Semisweet Chocolate Chips --
Or chunks
5 tb Boiling Water
4    Eggs -- separated
2 tb Dark Rum -- (or coffee or
Liquer
Graham Cracker Crust-----
15    Graham Crackers
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Butter -- melted
Put the chocolate in a blender on high for 6 seconds (or so). Scrape
the sides of the blender with a knife. Add the water and blend on
high for 10 seconds.  Then add the yolks and liquer/coffee and blend
until smooth.

Meanwhile, beat the egg ehites to stiffness.

Fold the chocolate into the egg whites.  Pour mousse into cups or
into the graham crakcer crust.  It makes about 4-6 servings.

Break the crackers into a blender and blend into crumbs. Place the
crumbs into a bowl.  Stir in the sugar, cinnamon and add the butter
and mix. Press into a pie plate and chill before adding filling.

I cheated and bought a Keebler shell. I brushed it with egg white and
baked it at 350 for 5 minutes.  I guess you could do that with this
crust, never tried.

Your standard toll-house chocolate works fine for the mousse but the
Ghirardelli chocolate made my knees weak! I also used anisette
instead of rum.

You should have seen my kitchen!  Flour and chocolate EVERYWHERE! At
least I got to lick the bowl
