Mix chocolate cookie crumbs and melted butter/margarine. Press firmly
into the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan (or use a pie pan). Bake
for 7-8 mins. Cool.

Use your electric mixer to prepare the filling. Cream butter/margarine
until smooth and gradually add the sugar. Melt the chocolate over
simmering (not boiling water in a double boiler or in a microwave
according to manufacturer's instructions). Combine melted chocolate,
vanilla and peppermint extracts and blend into butter/sugar mixture.
Add eggs 1 at a time and beat about 3 mins after adding each egg.

Beat cream until it holds a firm peak. Fold whipped cream into
chocolate mixture. Gently spread into prepared crust. Sprinkle with
grated chocolate (or use chocolate sprinkles). Loosely cover with
plastic wrap (try not to let plastic touch the surface of the torte).
Chill for at least 3 hours.

NOTE: This is very rich. Keep servings small. Chocoholics WILL come
back for seconds........
