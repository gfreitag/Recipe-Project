Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 c  Unsalted butter, at room
-temperature
1 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Cocoa
1 ts Baking powder
1/2    Teaspoo salt
In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together on mediumhigh
speed until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract. In a
medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Sift
the flour mixture onto the butter mixture. Beat on low speed until
combined. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, flatten into disks,
wrap in plastic and chill at least one hour. Preheat oven to 350
degrees. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment. On a lightly floured
work surface, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch. Using a maple leaf
cookie cutter, cut out the dough and transfer to the cookie sheets.
Gather up the dough scraps, reroll and cut out more cookies. Bake
until the cookies are crisp but not darkened, about 8 minutes.
Transfer the cookies to racks and cool completely. To assemble ice
cream sandwiches: Remove ice cream from the freezer and let it soften
until it can be spread easily. Scoop onto the flat side of one
cookie, leaving 1/4" border. Top with another cookie; press gently to
spread the ice cream to the edge. Wrap well in plastic wrap and
freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1
