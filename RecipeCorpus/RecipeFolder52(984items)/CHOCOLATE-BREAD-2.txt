Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
1    Pkg Active Dry Yeast
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Warm Water
1 c  Warm Water
4 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/3 c  Dutch Process Cocoa,
-Unsweetened
2 ts Salt
1    Egg, Lightly Beaten
2 tb Sweet Butter, At Room
-Temperature
1 c  Chocolate Morsels
Combine the yeast with half the sugar and the first measure of warm
(110 degree) water. Let stand until foamy (about 3 minutes). Combine
the flour, cocoa and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Use a
wooden spoon to stir in the yeast mixture, the butter, remaining
sugar and the second measure of water. Fit the mixer with a dough
hook and knead the dough at medium speed until the dough is smooth
and supple (about 10 minutes). Turn out onto a lightly floured board.
Knead by hand for 1 minute, adding more flour if needed. The dough
must be quite firm, not sticky, as it must stand on its own. Knead in
the chocolate morsels. Place the dough in the mixing bowl. Cover with
greased plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk
(1-1 1/2 hours). Grease the baking pan. Turn the dough out. Punch
down. Knead for 1 minute to expel air. Let rest for 5 minutes. Form
into an 8" x 4" oval. Place on the baking pan. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap. Let rise until
doubled in bulk (about 1 hour). Place the baking pan on the middle
rack of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375
degrees. Bake for another 25 minutes. Cool on a rack. Serve with
sweet butter.
