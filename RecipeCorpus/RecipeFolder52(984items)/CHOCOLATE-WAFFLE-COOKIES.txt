Title: CHOCOLATE WAFFLE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
6 tb Cocoa Powder
1 tb Shortening
6 tb Butter Or Margarine
1 c  Flour
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Vanilla
Melt first three ingredients in small pan, then set aside to cool. Mix
rest, then add chocolate mixture. Drop by teaspoonful on each square
of a waffle iron and cook for one minute. When cool drizzle with
melted frosting.  I use BC chocolate frosting but a cocoa/powdered
sugar/milk frosting would work well also.
