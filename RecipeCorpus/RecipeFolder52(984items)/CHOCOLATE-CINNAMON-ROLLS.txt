Title: CHOCOLATE CINNAMON ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast OR;
1 tb Active dry yeast, bulk
1/4 c  Warm water (110-115F)
1/2 c  Milk, lukewarm (scald, then
-cool to lukewarm)
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Shortening
1    Egg, large
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Cocoa
2 1/4 c  Flour, unbleached
2 tb Margarine or butter,
-softened
1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
MMMMM------------------POWDERED SUGAR FROSTING-----------------------
1 c  Powdered sugar, sifted
1 tb Milk
1/2 ts Vanilla
Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl. Stir in the
milk, 1/4 c. of the sugar, the shortening, egg and salt. Mix the
cocoa with the one and one quarter cup of the flour and add to the y
east mixture. Mix with a spoon until smooth.  Mix in enough of the
remaining flour to make the dough easy to handle, but still slightly
sticky and soft. Turn out on a lightly floured board and knead until
smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Let the dough rest while you
wash the mixing bowl, dry and grease it with shortening.  Put the
dough into the bowl, turning to grease the top. (At this point, the
dough can be covered and refrigerated 3-4 days, punching it down when
it gets too big for the bowl.) Cover and let rise in a warm place
until double, about 1-1/2 hrs. (Dough is ready when an indentation
remains when touched.) Punch the dough down and roll into a rectangle
12/9 inches. Spread the rectangle with the softened margarine and mix
the 1/4 c. of sugar and the cinnamon together, sprinkling it over the
buttered dough when done.  Rull up, beginning at the 12-in. side and
when fully rolled up, pinch the seam to seal.  Cut the roll into 12
slices and place slightly apart in a baking pan 9x9x2 inches. (For
larger rolls, place in 13x9x2 in. pan and let rise until it fills the
pan.) Cover and let rise until double, about 40 minutes.  Heat the
oven to 375F. Bake 25-30 minutes. Spread with powdered sugar frosting
while still warm. Mix frosting ingredients together until reaching a
spreading consistency. Makes enough frosting for 12 rolls. (Increase
amounts for larger rolls.)
