Yield: 4 Servings
100 g  Dark chocolate

40 g  Caster sugar

A slim, dark slice of velvety chocolate on your plate, a dollop of
crme fraiche - what could be better? This is a light yet rich
dessert, irresistible to chocolate lovers.

Melt the chocolate with the butter and sugar over a bowl of hot
water. Beat the eggs and stir in the flour. Stir the two mixtures
together and pour into a greased loaf tin lined with greaseproof
paper. Bake at 200 degrees C / 400 degrees F / gas 6 for 45 minutes
or until a knife comes out clean from the centre. Cool on a rack and
turn out when cold. Serve sliced thinly, with crme fraiche.
