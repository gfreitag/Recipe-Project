Title: CHOCOLATE RAISIN POPPYSEED COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 24 Servings
1/4 c  Milk
1 ts Lemon zest
1/2 c  Poppyseeds
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 oz Unsweetened baking chocolate
3/4 c  Sifted flour
1/4 c  Butter, softened
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1    Egg yolk
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1/4 c  Raisins, coarsely chopped
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets
with shortening.

In a small saucepan, heat the milk till it coats the back of a metal
spoon. Remove from heat.  Stir the poppyseeds into the milk and let
soak. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over simmering water,
stirring frequently. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg
yolk, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Mix well. Stir in the melted
chocolate.

Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon and cloves. Gradually add the
flour and spices to the batter. Stir in the poppyseed and milk and
mix well.

Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of batter on the baking sheets, about 2
inches apart.  Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the cookies have
browned around the edges.

After they have cooled for 2 or 3 minutes, remove them to cooling
racks. Makes about 24 cookies
