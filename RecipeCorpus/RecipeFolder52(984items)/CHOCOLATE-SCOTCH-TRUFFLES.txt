Title: CHOCOLATE SCOTCH TRUFFLES
Categories: Candies, Christmas
Yield: 40 Servings
1 1/2 lb Good-quality unsweetened
-chocolate
2    Egg yolks
1 c  Confectioner's sugar
1/2 c  Heavy or whipping cream
4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 c  Scotch whiskey
30    Whole shelled hazelnuts
1 c  Sifted unsweetened cocoa
-powder, for dusting
1.  Preheat the oven to 375F.

2.  Place 10 oz. of the chocolate in a heavy saucepan, and melt over
low heat.  Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.

3.  Combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the confectioner's sugar in a
large bowl, and cream until well blended.

4.  Combine the cream, butter, and remaining 1/2 c. sugar in a
medium-size saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until the butter
and sugar are thoroughly melted.

5.  Slowly pour the hot sugar mixture over the egg yolk mixture,
whisking constantly.  Mix thoroughly and set aside to cool slightly.
Then stir in the melted chocolate and the Scotch; beat for 1 minute.

6.  Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill until firm, 30 to
45 minutes.

7.  Meanwhile, place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them
in the oven for 15 minutes.  Remove them from the oven and rub
handfuls of nuts in a kitchen towel to remove the skins. Set them
aside.

8.  Roll a spoonful of the chilled chocolate around each hazelnut to
form a truffle about 1 inch in diameter. Set them on a baking sheet
lined with waxed paper, and chill thoroughly in the refrigerator 2 to
3 hours.

9.  Melt the remaining 14 oz. chocolate in a heavy saucepan over low
heat. Remove the pan from the heat.

10.  Sprinkle a shallow dish generously with cocoa. Dip each truffle
in the melted chocolate, covering it completely. Then lift it out
with a fork and roll it in the cocoa. Arrange the truffles on the
baking sheet again, and chill before serving.
