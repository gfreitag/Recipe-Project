Slice'n'bake chocolate wafers

Cut four 14x12-inch pieces of waxed paper or plastic wrap; set aside.
In large bowl, cream butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla until light and
fluffy.

In med. bowl, combine flour, baking soda and cocoa. Gradually stir
flour mixture into sugar mixture until evenly distributed. Divide
dough into four equal pieces and shape each piece, using dampened
hands so it doesn't stick, into a long roll, about 8-10 inches long.
Wrap each roll in one piece of waxed paper. Place wrapped rolls in
plastic freezer container with tight-fitting lid OR wrap air-tight in
large piece of heavy duty foil. Label; store in freezer and use
within 6 months.

To use one roll of dough (about 36 cookies): Preheat oven to 350
degrees. Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. Cut frozen dough into
1/4-inch slices. Place slices on prepared baking sheets about 1/2
inch apart. Bake 8 to 10 mins., until cookies are set and slightly
firm on top. Remove and cool completely on wire rack.
