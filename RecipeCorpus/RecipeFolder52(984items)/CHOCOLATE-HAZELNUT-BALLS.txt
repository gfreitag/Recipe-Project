Title: CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT BALLS
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Box vanilla wafers
8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 c  Chopped hazelnuts
1/2 c  Frangelico hazelnut liqueur
3 tb Corn syrup
Powdered sugar
Pulverize the vanilla wafers to powder in a food processor. Melt the
chocolate chips (microwave works well), taking care not to burn them.
Combine wafers, chocolate, hazelnuts, liqueur, and corn syrup; mix
until blended. Form into bite-sized balls. Roll in powdered sugar,
brushing excess sugar off for marbled look and less dusty eating.
