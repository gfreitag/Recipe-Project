Pour skim milk in small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, remove from
heat, and allow to cool.  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.
Combine skim milk, yeast mixture, sweetener of your choice,
shortening, fructose, egg and salt in a large mixing bowl. Combine
the cocoa with 1 1/4 cup of flour in another bowl. Stir to mix. Add
to liquid mixture in bowl. Beat on low until mixture is blended and
smooth.  Add remaining flour and stir until all the flour is
incorporated into the dough.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; then knead for 4 to 5
minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. Place in a greased
bowl, turn dough over, cover, and allow to rise until double in size
(about 1 1/2 hours). Punch dough down and roll to abut 1/2 inch
thickness. Cut with floured doughnut cutter.  Place doughnuts onto a
greased cookie sheet or piece of waxed paper.  Cover and allow to

a doughnut. Place doughnut in the hot oil, and fry about 2 minutes on
each side.  Remove from oil; drain on paper towels. Repeat with
