Title: CHOCOLATE OATMEAL BARS
Categories: Bar cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 c  Vegetable shortening
2 c  Light brown sugar; packed
2 lg Eggs
2 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Rolled oats
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1    Semisweet chocolate chips
2 tb Butter
1    Sweetened condensed milk
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Walnuts; chopped
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

To make the crust, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. In a
large bowl, cream the vegetable shortening and brown sugar. Beat in
the eggs and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Fold in
the rolled oats. Press 2/3 of the crust mixture into an ungreased 13
x 9 inch baking pan.

To prepare the filling, melt the chocolate chips and butter in a
double boiler over low heat, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat
and stir in the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Fold in the
nuts.

Spread the filling evenly over the crust in the baking pan. Press the
remaining crust mixture on top of the filling. Bake for 25 to 30
minutes, until firm to the touch. Cool in the pan on a wire rack
before butting into large or small bars.

Variation:  I substituted approximately 1 cup coconut for the nuts.
It was very good. Contributor: 1001 Cookie Recipes from Gregg R.
