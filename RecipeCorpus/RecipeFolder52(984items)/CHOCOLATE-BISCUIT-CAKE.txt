A firm favourite over the years, this cake proves ever-popular.
Delightfully simple to prepare - no cooking! - it makes a lovely
dessert at any time of the year, and especially for picnics.

Work the butter or margarine with the cocoa, and mix in the biscuit
crumbs. Mix the sugar with a little water and dissolve it over a low
heat, stirring. Then bring to the boil and simmer until syrupy -
about 3-4 minutes. Blend into the cocoa mixture. Stir in the egg,
then fold in the biscuits broken into bite-sized pieces. Put into an
oiled loaf tin and chill until set. Turn out when completely cold and
serve sliced, with crme fraiche.
