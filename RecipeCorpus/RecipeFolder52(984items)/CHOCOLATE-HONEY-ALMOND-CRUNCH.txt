Categories: Candies, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Sliced almonds
1/4 c  Honey
6 oz Unsalted butter
8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
-chopped into 1/4" pcs
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Water
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
-chopped into 1/4" pcs
1/4 c  Myer's Dark rum
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast 2 cups of almonds on a baking
sheet in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 to 14
minutes. Remove the almonds from the oven and allow to cool to room
temperature. Transfer the almonds to a large dish or other suitable
container and set aside until needed. Melt the butter in a 2 1/2-qt
saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly as it melts so it does
not simmer or boil. As soon as the butter is completely melted, add
the sugar, water, rum, and honey. Increase the heat to medium high.
Heat the mixture to a temperature of 220 degrees, stirring
constantly. Add the untoasted almonds and continue to heat and stir
until the mixture reaches a temperature of 225 degrees. Evenly divide
the honey-almond mixture between the 2 baking sheets. Place the
baking sheets on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and
bake until the mixture is evenly caramelized, about 24 to 26 minutes.
Rotate the baking sheets from top to bottom about halfway through the
baking time. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
Combine the semi-sweet and unsweetened chocolate pieces and evenly
divide and sprinkle over the surface of the caramelized hone-almond
mixture. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to spread the
chocolate throughout the mixture. Evenly divide and sprinkle the
toasted almonds over the chocolate. Place both baking sheets in the
freezer for 20 minutes. Remove the Chocolate Honey Almond Crunch from
the freezer and break into irregular pieces. Store in a sealed
plastic container in the freezer or refrigerator. Yields: About 2 3/4
