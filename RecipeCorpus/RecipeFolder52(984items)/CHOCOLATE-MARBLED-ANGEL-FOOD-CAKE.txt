Title: CHOCOLATE MARBLED ANGEL FOOD CAKE
Categories: New, Text, Import
2 TB unsweetened cocoa powder
Yield: 4 Servings
3 TB boiling water
1 ts almond extract
14 lg egg whites, -- about 1 3/4
cups
:
1 ts cream of tartar
1 3/4 c  sugar
1/2 ts salt
2 ts vanilla
1 1/4 c  flour, -- sifted

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, combine the cocoa,
water, and almond extract until blended. Set aside to cool. Beat the
egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gently
beat in the sugar, salt, and vanilla until the peaks retain their
shape when the whisk is removed. Gradually fold in the flour until
well blended. Remove 2 cups of batter and combine it with the cocoa
mixture. Pour half of the light batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube
pan with removable bottom. Pour the chocolate batter over the light.
Finally, top with the remaining light batter. Gently swirl mixture
with a knife to help remove any air bubbles and to create a marble
pattern. Bake in the middle of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes until
the cake is springy and begins to pull away from the sides of the
pan. The cake will rise, crack on the top, and then fall slightly.
This is normal. Remove from the oven and invert the pan over the neck
of a bottle until the cake is completely cool, about 1 hour. Gently
loosen the sides and remove the cake from pan. Place it on a serving
plate. This cake can be served alone or with a chocolate sauce. A
serrated knife makes cutting the cake much easier.
