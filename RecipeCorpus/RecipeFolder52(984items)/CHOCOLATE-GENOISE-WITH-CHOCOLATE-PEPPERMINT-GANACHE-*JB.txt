For syrup: Stir water and sugar in small saucepan over low heat until
sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil. Remove from heat. Stir in creme
de cacao and vanilla. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill.)

For genoise: Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour 9-inch-diameter
springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides; line bottom with parchment
paper. Cover cake rack with paper towel; spray paper towel with
nonstick spray.

Sift flour, cocoa powder and baking soda into small bowl 3 times.
Combine eggs, egg yolk, sugar and salt in large stainless steel bowl.
{Step One} Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let
bottom of bowl touch water). Whisk until mixture is just warm to
touch (thermometer will register 110 B0F), about 2 minutes. Remove
mixture from over water. {Step Two} Using electric mixer, beat until
mixture triples in volume and falls in heavy ribbon when beaters are
lifted, about 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Sift flour mixture over in
3 additions; fold gently to incorporate each time. Drizzle butter
over and fold in (do not overmix or batter will deflate). Transfer
batter to prepared pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40
minutes. Cut around pan sides; release sides. Turn cake out onto
towel-covered rack; peel off parchment. Cool. (Can be made 1 day
ahead. Wrap; store at room temperature.)

For ganache: Place chocolate in large bowl. Bring cream to boil in
small saucepan. Pour cream over chocolate. {Step Three} Add corn
syrup and extracts; whisk until smooth. Cool to room temperature,
stirring occasionally.

Transfer 3 cups ganache to medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat
until very thick and light colored, about 12 minutes.

Using long serrated knife, cut genoise horizontally into 3 layers.
Place 1 cake layer on cardboard round or pan bottom. Brush cake with
3 tablespoons syrup. Spread 1/3 of whipped ganache over. Repeat 2
more times with remaining cake layers, syrup and whipped ganache.
Spread 1 cup unwhipped ganache thinly over top and sides of cake.
Refrigerate cake until coating sets, about 10 minutes.

If necessary, warm remaining un-whipped ganache until just pourable.
Place cake on rack set over sheet of foil. Pour ganache over cake as
glaze, spreading to cover top and sides smoothly. Chill until glaze
begins to set, about 30 minutes. Place cake on platter. Press
chocolate curls onto sides. Chill at least 2 hours.

Makes 10-12 servings.
