* (To make chocolate curls, scrape a bar of chocolate with a vegetable
peeler) PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 275F. TO MAKE THE MERINGUE SHELL: Beat
the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar together in the large bowl
of an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Slowly beat in the sugar.
Beat until meringue is very stiff. Beat in the vanilla. Grease a
9-inch glass pie pan. Spread the meringue over the bottom and sides,
building up the sides as high as possible. Sprinkle the nuts over the
bottom. Bake for 1 hour. (If, after 10 minutes, the sides start to
sag, gently push back into place.) Turn off the oven and let the
shell cool in the oven for 30 minutes. Cool completely on a wire
rack. TO MAKE THE FILLING: Melt the chocolate in the top of a double
boiler over hot water. Add the milk, vanilla and salt. Stir until
smooth. Cool. Beat 1 cup cream until stiff and fold into the cooled
chocolate mixture. Spread evenly in the meringue shell. Refrigerate 4
hours. Before serving, beat the remaining cream with the
confectioners' sugar until stiff. Spread over top of pie. Decorate
with chocolate curls.
