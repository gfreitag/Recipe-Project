NOTES:

*  A no-bake chocolate cake -- This is a very simple, quick, no-bake
cake for those of us who hate getting near an oven, but like
delightful cheese cakes. This recipe is originally from the _Yediot
Achronot_ (Latest News) newspaper supplement here in Israel. It
should be prepared a day or two before you intend to eat it, so that
the flavoring fills out. Definitely not for people on a diet. Yield:
Serves 6-8.

*  You can replace the milk and cream with about 1 1/2 lb of 9
percent milk fat cheese.  This is a product sold in Israel. The
nearest equivalent in North America is sour cream. If you do this,
replace the pudding with about 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. If you are
not a chocolate lover, you may replace the chocolate pudding with
vanilla pudding (or with vanilla extract if you are using the 9
percent cheese)

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
