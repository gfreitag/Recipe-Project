Note:  These intensely chocolate cookies deserve their name --
because of their shape, of course, and yours if you eat too many.

Yield: 25 Large Cookies

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. and grease 3 cookie sheets.

Melt the chocolate with the butter in a double boiler over simmering
water. Cool to room temperature.

Beat the eggs with the sugar in a mixer bowl until a ribbon forms
when the beaters are lifted, about 10 minutes. Beat in the chocolate
mixture and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a
medium bowl and stir into the chocolate mixture just until combined.
DO NOT OVERMIX!!! Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts. Drop batter
by quarter cupfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookies sheets
(DO NOT FLATTEN). Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until barely firm and tops
are just dry and slightly cracked. Cool on the cookie sheest for 2
minutes and then gently transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
