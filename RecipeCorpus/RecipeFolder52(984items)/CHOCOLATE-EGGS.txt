Title: CHOCOLATE EGGS
Categories: Holidays, Candies, Easter
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/3 c  Hot water
4 c  Granulated cane sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
3 oz Unsweetened chocolate, chopd
2 tb Butter
Chocolate compound coating
Stir hot water, sugar and corn syrup together in three quart heavy
saucepan. Place over high heat and stir constantly until all sugar
crystals are dissolved. Wash down sides of pan with pastry brush
dipped in hot water. Clip on thermometer and continue cooking without
stirring until temperature reaches 240, washing down sides twice more
as mixture cooks. Remove from heat. Entire cooking process takes
about 12 minutes. As soon as bubbles subside, pour mixture onto
marble slab or cookie sheet. Allow to cool, undisturbed, until
fondant holds the imprint of your finger and feels lukewarm, about
eight minutes. Cut butter in small pieces and scatter over surface.
Pour melted chocolate over fondant. Work the fondant with a scraper,
lifting it up from all sides and keeping the mass in constant motion.
When the fondant is stiff enough to hold the scraper staight up, it
is finished. Knead briefly and place the ball of fondant in a
container. Cover with a damp cloth, then cover the container. Get out
as needed and knead a little before using. Shape into egg shapes and
dip in chocolate coating or real chocolate. From Sweet Thing @5211
