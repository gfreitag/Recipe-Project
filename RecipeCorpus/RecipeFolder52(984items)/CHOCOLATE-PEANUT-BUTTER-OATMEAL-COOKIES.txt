Title: CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER OATMEAL COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 312 Servings
2 c  Sugar
4 tb Cocoa
1/2 c  Peaunut Butter
2 ts Vanilla
2 1/4 c  Oatmeal ( I use 3 c. when I
-make it)
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Margarine
1 ts Cinnamon ( This is optional
-and something that I added
-to this myself)
Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies

Blend sugar, margarine, cocoa and milk in a Large pan. Heat on stove
over medium heat until well blended. Bring to a boil for exactly 11/2
min. Add peanut butter, oats, vanilla, and cinnamon. Mix well and
spoon onto waxed paper.  Makes 31/2 to 4 dozen cookies. It is
important to watch the time that you let this boil, if you boil it
too long, the cookies, will turn into hard rocks, and you will
probably have a pan stuck with hard stuff, too.  It is important to
get the mixture on to the waxed paper as quickly as possible. This is
when the kids, and Teaspoons come in handy...
