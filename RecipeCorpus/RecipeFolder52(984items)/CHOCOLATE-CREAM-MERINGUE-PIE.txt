Yield: 1 Servings
1    9" baked pastry shell
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
6 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Milk
3    Egg yolks  -- slightly

1/2 c  Butter
2 ts Vanilla

4    Egg whites
1/2 ts Cream of tarter

Combine sugar, flour, cocoa and salt in medium saucepan; stir in
milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture boils;
remove from heat. Stir half of the mixture into beaten egg yolks;
return mixture to sauce pan. Continue cooking and stirring over
medium heat until mixture boils; boil and stir for 1 minute. Remove
from heat and stir in butter and vanilla. Cool for 10 minutes, pour
into pie shell. Heat oven to 350 F.

Meanwhile, prepare meringue topping: In a small mixer bowl, beat egg
whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat
until stiff peaks form. Spread this on warm pie filling, carefully
sealing to the edges of crust. Bake 5 to 8 minutes, or just until
meringue is lightly browned. Cool to room temperature; chill for
several hours. Refrigerate leftovers.
