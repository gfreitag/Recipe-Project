Title: CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Net
Yield: 12 Muffins
3/4 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter, melted
1    Egg
1 3/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
1/3 c  Brown sugar, packed
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Chocolate chips, semisweet
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
Heat oven to 400 degrees F.; line 12 medium muffin cups with paper
baking cups or grease bottoms only of muffin cups.

Beat milk, margarine and egg.  Stir in remaining ingredients, all at
once, just until flour is moistened (batter will be lumpy). Fill
muffin cups about 2/3 full. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until golden
brown.

Her notes:

*  I don't use paper baking cups. I spray with Pam only the bottoms
of the muffin depressions in the pan. I always increase the amount of
chocolate chips and nuts a little because I like them and I usually
think recipes are chintzy with them.

*  Use a fork to loosen them and tip them up in the pan as soon as
they come out of the oven. That way you'll get a crisper crust on the
bottom and sides.
