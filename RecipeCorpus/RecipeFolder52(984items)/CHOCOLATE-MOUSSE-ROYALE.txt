Title: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE ROYALE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
12 oz Semisweet chocolate
1 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
6    Egg yolks
Melt chocolate in top of double boiler, SLOWLY, over hot, not boiling
water.

Combine water, sugar and vanilla and cook syrup until it reaches 230
degrees on a candy thermometer.  Set syrup aside and let it cool to a
warm temperature around 125 degrees.

Meanwhile, whip the cream until it is stiff and refrigerate it. (
kitchen aid, use whip start on 8 ... increase to 10)

Place egg yolks in mixer bowl and beat them for 1 minute. Slowly (
just a fine line of syrup) start adding warm syrup beating all the
while until yolks are thick and cool...approx 5 minutes. (kitchen
aid, use paddle, speed 3)

Slowly beat in the chocolate until it is blended in the yolk mixture.
Slowly beat in the cream until it is thoroughly mixed. (kitchen aid,
use paddle...speed2)

Pour mixture into 8 long stem glasses or pretty desert dishes. Chill
until firm.  Serves 8

Notes.... This mousse is simple, yet a little tricky. The thing to
remember is that the  syrup needs to be warm when beating into the
egg yolks. Then beat the yolks until they are cooled.

* If you are useing this at holiday time, it is wonderful served in
chocolate boxes, or cups
