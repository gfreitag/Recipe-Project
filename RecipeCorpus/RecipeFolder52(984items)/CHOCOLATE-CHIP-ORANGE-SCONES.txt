Preheat oven to 400 degrees; butter a 9-inch
circle in the center of a baking sheet.  In a large
bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder
and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and
distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry
blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in
the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, stir together the eggs, orange juice,
vanilla extract and orange peel.  Add to the flour
mixture and stir to combine. The dough will be sticky.
With lightly floured hands, knead in the chocolate
chips until they are evenly distributed.  With lightly
floured hands, pat the dough into an 8-inch circle in
the center of the baking sheet. If desired, brush the
egg white mixture over the tops and sides of the
dough. With a serrated knife, cut the dough into 8
wedges. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a
toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool for 10
minutes. With a spatula, transfer the scones to a wire
rack to cool. Recut into wedges if necessary. Serve
warm or cool completely and store in an air-tight
container.
These scones freeze well.   Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
