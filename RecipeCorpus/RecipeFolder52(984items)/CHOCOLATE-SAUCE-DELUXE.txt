Title: CHOCOLATE SAUCE DELUXE
Categories: Sauces, Desserts
Yield: 3 Cups
1/2 c  Butter
3 oz Chocolate, bitter
2 1/2 c  Sugar, powdered
1 1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/8 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
Melt butter with chocolate in saucepan.  Add other ingredients (except
vanilla) and cook 20-25 minutes over medium heat. Mixture will slowly
thicken.  Add vanilla and serve over ice cream.

NOTES:

*  Hot fudge sauce for ice cream -- This is the fudgiest and best
sauce you'll ever taste. The recipe has been passed down in our
family for years and years.

*  This sauce becomes like fudge candy when refrigerated, and it's
hard to keep from poking your finger in it for a taste. Simply reheat
in a saucepan to melt it down.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
