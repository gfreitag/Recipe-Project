Title: CHOCOLATE PECAN UPSIDE-DOWN
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
8 tb Butter
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
1/2 c  Coconut
1/2 c  Chocolate morsels
2/3 c  Finely chopped pecans
1 tb Milk
1 c  Flour
1/2 c  White sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/3 c  Water
1    Egg
Melt 4T butter.  Stir in brown sugar, coconut, pecans, chocolate
morsels, and milk.  Blend well and spread on the bottom of a 9 inch
cake pan. Mix dry cake ingredients in a bowl. Add liquids and
remaining 4 T of melted butter.  Beat until the batter is smooth.
Pour over the pecan mixture in pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 30
minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cover with a large plate and flip.  Tap  plate and pan firmly on the
counter. Remove cake pan and scrape any remaining topping onto the
cake.

Serve warm  with ice cream.  It is good without the ice cream but I
serve it with vanilla ice cream scoops that are dusted with cocoa or
with a bit of warm caramel topping garnished with pecans. Utterly
disgraceful decadence!

If you don't like coconut, omit it and use a extra 1/2 C of pecans.
