Title: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE WITH RUM SOAKED RAISINS
Categories: Pudding, Mousse, Chocolate, Alcohol, Raisin
Yield: 1 Mousse
1/4 c  Dark raisins
1/4 c  Dark rum
7 oz Bittersweet chocolate
1 c  Creme Fraiche
3    Extra-large eggs; separated
Six ramekins or long-stemmed
-wine goblets.
Several hours (up to 24) ahead, combine the raisins and the rum in a
small bowl, cover tightly with plastic and set aside to soak. Break
the chocolate into pieces and process in a processor until ground
very fine. Heat the creme Fraiche to the boiling point, and with the
motor running, pour it through the feed tube in a steady stream.
Process a few seconds until smooth. Separate the eggs. Add the egg
yolks to the hot chocolate mixture, and process for a few seconds to
incorporate. Transfer to a large bowl, stir  in the drained raisins,
and cool completely. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites
until stiff but not dry. Scoop about one quarter of the beaten whites
onto the chocolate mixture, and using a large rubber spatula, stir
them into the mixture. Gently and quickly fold in the remaining
whites. Pour the mousse into the serving dishes, cover tightly with
plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and as long as 12
hours. Adding the yolks to the hot chocolate mixture cooks them
slightly and gives a creamier texture to the mousse, which is best
served the day it is prepared. Decorate with chocolate curls or extra
rum-soaked raisins. From: Jody Prival Busted and entered for you by:
