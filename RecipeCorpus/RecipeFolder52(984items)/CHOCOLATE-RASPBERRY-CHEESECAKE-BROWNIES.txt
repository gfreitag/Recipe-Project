Directions:

In heatproof bowl set over hot (not boiling) water, melt semisweet
with unsweetened chocolate. Remove from heat; stir until smooth. Let
cool to lukewarm. In large bowl, beat cream cheese with 1/3 cup of
the sugar until smooth. Beat in 1 of the eggs and 1 teaspoon of the
vanilla until well combined. Set aside. In separate large bowl, beat
butter with remaining sugar until smooth. Beat in remaining eggs, one
at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in remaining
vanilla, then chocolate, mixing well. Mix in flour and salt just
until combined.

Line a 13 x 9 inch cake pan with foil, leaving overhand for "handles".

Reserve 1 cup of the chocolate batter. Spread remaining chocolate
batter in pan. Spread with cream cheese mixture. Spoon reserved
chocolate batter in dollops over top.

Spoon jam in smaller dollops among chocolate dollops. With knife,
zigzag through layers for marble effect.

Bake in 350F oven for 35 minutes or until tester inserted 2 inches
from centre comes out slightly moist. Let cool on rack. Using foil
handles, lift onto cutting board; cut into squares.

(Can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 4 days; bring to
room temperature).
