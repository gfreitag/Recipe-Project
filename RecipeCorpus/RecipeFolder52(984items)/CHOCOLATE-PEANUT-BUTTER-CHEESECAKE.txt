F.

In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar until light and
fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.  Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla,
beat until smooth.  Add heavy cream, beat till well blended.

Transfer 1/3 of batter to another bowl and set aside. Beat melted
chocolate into remaining batter.  Pour into crust. With mixer on
medium speed, beat peanut butter into remaining 1/3 batter until
thoroughly mixed. Carefully spoon peanut butter mixture on top of
chocolate cheese mixture in pan. Using the long handle of a wooden
spoon, swirl the two flavors together.

Bake about 1 hour, or until cheesecake is set around edges and puffed
but still jiggles slightly in the center. Let cake cool 2 hours, then
refrigerate until well chilled, 8 hrs. or overnight.

For a crust, I use Oreo cookie crumbs and make a crust using their
recipe. I also do not swirl the flavors together. I like them layered
better.
