Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
Yield: 12 Servings

Separate eggs. Beat yolks lightly with fork. Melt chocolate and
margarine, add yolks. Beat whites with sugar until stiff, fold in
chocolate mixture. Divide in half and pour one half into a greased
26cm spring form. (nb. , I'd probably use a cake tin :-) Bake for
approx 15 minutes or until dry on top. Cool for a few minutes, then
pour over second half of mixture. Freeze immediately. If placed in
deep freeze, take out at least 30 mins before serving.
