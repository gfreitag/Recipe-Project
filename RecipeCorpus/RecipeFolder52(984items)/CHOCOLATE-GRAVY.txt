Title: CHOCOLATE GRAVY
Categories: Courtney, Breakfast, Chocolate, American
Yield: 1 Batch
3 tb Cocoa
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
2 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
2 ts Vanilla Extract
Mix the cocoa, sugar, and flour together.  Add the milk, making sure
it mixes smoothly.  Heat (medium) and stir constantly until it
thickens. This takes about 8 minutes. Take off of heat. Add butter.
Stir until it is melted and mixed.  Add vanilla and stir until mixed.

Serve hot over buttered biscuits.  Buttered toast will do in a pinch.

Notes: This is an almost lost Ozark classic. It hardly ever shows up
in ethnic or regional cookbooks.

If this cools, it becomes something else: chocolate pudding!

Chocolate gravy is a great way to make sure your kids get their
minimum daily requirement of sugar!
