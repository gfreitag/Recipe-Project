Title: CHOCOLATE PANCAKES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 3 Dozen
3/4 c  Margarine
3/4 c  Cocoa
2 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter cream
-frosting
Melt the margarine and mix with the cocoa.

In a small bowl, mix flour and salt.

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs.  Then add sugar, vanilla, and beat
well. Add flour and margarine mixture to this and blend thoroughly.

Heat skillet to medium-low.  Drop small clumps (about 1 T) and cook
like pancakes:  about 1 1/2 minutes on one side, 1/2 minute on the
other, then turn over again and remove after a few seconds. Freeze.
When relatively hard, coat one side with buttercream frosting.

NOTES:

*  Brownies in a skillet -- This recipe is based on a "chocolate
turtle" recipe by Mae Rabenius from a cookbook produced by Faith
United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona. Yield: 40 pieces.

*  One side of the pancakes may burn.  It doesn't particularly affect
the taste, and if you frost this side, no one will even know.

*  It's not necessary to cook the pancakes completely; if the middle
looks somewhat gooey, don't fret:  it will soon harden.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to
frost. : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
