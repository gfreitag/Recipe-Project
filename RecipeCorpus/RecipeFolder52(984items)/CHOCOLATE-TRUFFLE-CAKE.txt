Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
16 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 c  Sweet butter
1 1/2 ts Flour
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Hot water
4    Eggs, separated
Oil bottom of 8 or 9-inch springform pan.  Melt chocolate and butter
( I did this in a saucepan, although the original recipe calls for it
being done in a 200-degree oven.). Add flour, sugar, and water; blend
well. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.
In a separate bowl ( a metal one!) beat egg whites until stiff. Fold
gently into chocolate mixture. Turn into prepared pan and bake for 15
minutes in middle of 425 degree oven (I found that in the 9-inch pan,
I needed to extend this to 25 minutes for it to be completely
cooked.). Let cake cool completely. Sift or sprinkle powdered sugar
over top of cooled cake.
