Title: CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream, Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
2 c  Milk
1 3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Half & Half
1 tb Vanilla Extract
4 c  Whipping Cream
Pillsbury Chocolate Chip
- Cookie Dough (large size)
- OR homemade cookie dough
Take the chocolate cookie dough out of fridge and leave out till
needed. Scald milk until bubbles form around edge. Remove from heat.
Add sugar and salt. Stir until dissolved. Stir in half and half,
vanilla, and whipping cream. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Freeze
as directed by your ice cream machine's instructions. Once ice cream
has been through the entire ice cream machine process and is now a
chilled soft ice cream, add the chocolate chip cookie dough. Just
break up the dough as best you can with your hands and drop it in
small clusters into the soft ice cream. Try to mix it around to
ensure that the cookie dough is evenly distributed throughout the ice
cream. Put the ice cream in the freezer for several hours until
hardened. Origin: We pretty much took our vanilla ice cream recipe
and added the chocolate chip cookie dough. You can easily use the
Pillsbury cookie dough, but it's cheaper and better to use homemade.
Our Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough recipe makes this
especially yummy!
