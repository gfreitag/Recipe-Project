Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Flour, all purpose
1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
1/2 c  Cocoa powder
3 oz Butter; chilled
1    Egg
6 oz Semisweet chocolate; chopped
2 c  Whipping cream
2    Raspberry boxes;I assume
-they mean pints, I would
-use 3-4 cups
CHOCOLATE PASTRY: Combine flour, sugar & cocoa in work bowl of a food
processor. Pulse 2 or 3 times to aerate. Chop the butter into pieces
and distribute over the flour. Process until mixture reassembles
coarse meal, do NOT overprocess. With motor running, drop in whole
egg (no we do not mean the shell too) through the feed tube. Process
very briefly - do not let the dough come together or your pastry will
be tough. Remove the dough from work bowl and set aside at room
temperature until the filling is made. TRUFFLE FILLING: Place the
chopped chocolate in a medium size bowl, bring the cream to boil over
medium-high heat. Pour over the chocolate and whisk till all the
chocolate is melted. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
set. Preheat the oven to 375F. Work the chocolate pastry with your
hands and press it into an 8" or (" tart pan with removable bottom;
try to get an even thickness. Chill for 20 minutes. Prick the bottom
of the pastry with a fork. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25
minutes. Cool completely. TO ASSEMBLE: Remove the tart gently form
the pan and set it on a platter. Spoon over pipe the truffle filling
into the shell and smooth the surface. Arrange the raspberries over
the top in concentric circles. Serve at room Temperature for the
fullest flavour. Anne's note: I would not make this on very hot days
as the filling might melt. SERVES: 6
