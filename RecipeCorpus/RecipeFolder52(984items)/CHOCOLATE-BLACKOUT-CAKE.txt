Cake:

Butter 2 9" cake pans, dust with flour, set aside. Stir cocoa with
some milk to form a paste. Stir in the rest of the milk and beat with
a whisk until smooth. Set aside. Cream the butter and shortening with
the sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each
addition. Add the vanilla and blend. Sift the flour with the baking
powder, baking soda and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter in
three parts, alternating between each addition with the cocoa
mixture, beating after each addition. BEAT ONLY TILL INGREDIENTS ARE
ABSORBED. Divide batter equally in the two cake pans. Bake 35 to 40
minutes, or untill cake pulls away from sides on pan, and a cake
tester (toothpick) inserted into cake comes out clean. Place cakes on
wire racks and allow to cool completely.

Filling:

Combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in small saucepan. Gradually add
the milk while mixing with a wire whisk. Add the chopped chocolate.
Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, untill mixture
thickens and bubbles for three minutes. Filling should have the
texture of pudding (because that's just what it is). Place in small
bowl to cool with plastic wrap directly cxovering the surface to
prevent a skin from forming.
