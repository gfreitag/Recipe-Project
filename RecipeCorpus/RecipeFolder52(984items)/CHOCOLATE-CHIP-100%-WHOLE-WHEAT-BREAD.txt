Put all ingredients except chocolate chips into the bread maker in the
order listed.  Run the machine as if making raisin bread ("MIX BREAD"
setting on Hitachi and Regal machines). At the point where you'd add
the raisins to the dough, add the chocolate chips.  For easy removal
from the pan, let the machine run completely through its cool-down
cycle.
