Title: CHOCOLATE & CHESTNUT LOAF
Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 10 Servings
15 1/2 oz Can unsweetened chestnut
Puree
6 oz Unsalted (sweet) butter
4 oz Castor sugar (v. fine grain)
8 oz Darkest plain chocolate
2 tb Brandy
Piped cream (optional)
Maron glace (optional)
Recommended to make 1 day ahead.

Melt Chocolate (this should be at least 55% cocoa - 75% is great!).

Put better in bowl. Beat until pale and creamy. Add sugar and beat
until fluffy andf light. Add chestnut puree and beat until thoroughly
blended and smooth. (a mixer is so much easier!!! I didn't have one
and found the best way to make sure it wasn't lumpy was to press the
puree through a sieve first - interesting texture!).

Add melted chocolate, brandy and 1 tb of water. Mix thoroughly.

Brush a 2lb bread tin lightly with oil and line with greaseproof
paper and brush LIGHTLY with oil.

Put mixture into tin - flatten top and place lightly oiled greaseproof
paper on top. Cover tin with foil and refigerate for at least 8 hours.

Serve straight from fridge optionally decorated with piped cream
and/or maron glace.

Note: This is a VERY rich desert; a 3/4 inch slice is usually enough!

Time: about an hour (+8 hours cooling) Source: My sister
