Title: CHOCOLATE CORDIALS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Batch
Maraschino cherries or
-pineapple in heavy syrup
Summer coating
Divert sugar
Melt summer coating over hot (NOT boiling) water. Using a small
paint brush coat the insides of the molds, holding up to light to
check for thin spots. Chill until set.
Mix cherry juice or a small amount of pineapple syrup with divert
sugar to make a thick paste, about the consistency of the melted
chocolate. Put fondant mix into chocolate shells, add a cherry or
piece of pineapple. Cover with summer coating, tap sides of mold to
release air bubbles, and freeze for 2 to 3 minutes. When set unmold
and put each cherry into a paper candy cup.  Store at room
temperature for 2 days.
For an unusual treat, soak cherries for two weeks in liquor before
putting into shells.
