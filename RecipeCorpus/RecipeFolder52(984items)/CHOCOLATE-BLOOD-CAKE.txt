Dead simple this. Make up the sponge mix but add loads of red food
colouring to get the mixture nice and blood like. Next, add about
400g of the chocolate (melted of course) to the sponge mix, adding
more food colouring if the mixture seems to be getting too pinky.
Allow to cook for the normal length of time. Make up quite a bit of
icing in the meantime (adding the final 100g of chocolate to this)
and colour this red also.

When the cake has cooked, allow to cool for about 1 hour and then cut
in 1/2. taking the top half, pour the icing over and allow to set
pretty randomly, but place the vampire teeth in the icing where they
will cause maximum effect (in the centre is usually a good bet).
Before you serve this cake, place a generous layer of the ice-cream
on top of the bottom layer and replace the top. serve with extra
scoops of the ice cream and strawberry sauce.

Enjoy!

Whoops. Forgot to say mix the smarties into the cake mix, and stick a
few more in the icing. And remember use RED ones (you can really
freak ppl out by telling them they are blood clots!)
