Title: CHOCOLATE PECAN PRALINES
Categories: Candies, Chocolate
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Sugar; granulated
1 c  Brown sugar; light, packed,*
1/2 c  Light cream or half & half
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
2 oz Chocolate, baking; 2 squares
1 ts Butter
1 c  Pecans; coarsely chopped
*    You can use Maple Sugar, if you desire, in place of the Light
Brown Sugar.

Combine the sugars, cream, and salt in a large saucepan. Cook over
medium heat, stirring constantly, to 228 degrees F on a candy
thermometer. Remove from the heat and add the baking chocolate,
broken into small pieces, butter, and pecans.  Return to the heat,
stirring constantly, and cook to the soft ball stage (234 degrees
F.). Remove from the heat, add the vanilla, then cool the mixture for
5 minutes. Beat for 10 to 15 seconds until the mixture slightly
thickens. Quickly drop candy, by large spoon- fuls onto greased
plates or waxed paper. If the mixture becomes too thick to drop, stir
in a tablespoonful of hot water. Makes about 2 dozen pieces.
