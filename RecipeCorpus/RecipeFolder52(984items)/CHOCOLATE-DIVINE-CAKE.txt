Yield: 14 Servings
1 c  Sifted all-purpose
Unbleached flour
3/4 c  Sifted stone-ground whole
Wheat flour
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt (optional)
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  (plus 2 tablespoons lightly
Packed brown sugar
1    Medium baking potato, 4 oz.,

1 pt Nonfat plain yogurt or

2 tb Mild honey
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Chocolate flavor (optional)
1/3 c  Canola oil
3 lg Egg whites, at room temp
Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease a 12-cup Bundt pan and dust with
unsweetened cocoa powder.  Over a large bowl, sift both flours, cocoa
powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix in both sugars until there are no
lumps. Set aside. Put the peeled potato into a large food processor.
Using the steel blade, process the potato until finely minced. Drain
the yogurt of all excess liquid.  Discard excess liquid.  Add the
drained yogurt, honey, vanilla, chocolate flavor, and vegetable oil
to the minced potato in the food processor and mix on high for 60
seconds.  Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl while processing.
Pour this mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients and beat with an
electric beater on high for 60 seconds. Be sure to scrape the sides
of the bowl while beating. Clean and dry the beaters well. In another
bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold the egg whites
into the batter until everything is mixed well. Pour the batter into
the prepared Bundt pan. Bake in a preheated oven for 55 to 65 minutes
or until a cake tester comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven
and let cool for 25 minutes. Do not be concerned if the cake falls
slightly.  Using a knife, go around inside and out side edges of
cake. Invert the Bundt pan over a plate and carefully shake the cake
loose. Let the cake cool completely and frost with a chocolate glaze.
