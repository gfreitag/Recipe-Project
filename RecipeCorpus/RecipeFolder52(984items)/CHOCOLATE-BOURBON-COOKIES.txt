Title: CHOCOLATE BOURBON COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
Yield: 50 Servings
2 c  Flour
6 tb Cocoa powder unsweetened
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Butter, softened
1 c  Brown sugar, firm pack
1/2 c  Bourbon
1 c  Mini chocolate chips
- semi sweet
2    Egg whites
2 tb Water
3 c  Pecans, finely chopped
Combine the flour and cocoa powder, cinnamon and salt in a small
bowl. Set aside. Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl
until creamy and smooth. Beat in bourbon until well blended.
Gradually add dry ingredients to butter mixture, beating well after
each addition. Stir in the chocolate chips. Cover dough with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. When ready to bake
cookies, preheat oven to 350~F. Grease 2 large cookie sheets. Beat
together egg whites and water and set aside. Using 1 level tbls.,
shape dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter. Roll each ball first
in the egg whites then in the chopped nuts. Arrange the balls 1/2
inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets. If the dough gets to soft,
periodically return the dough to the refrigerator. Bake the cookies
in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until they are still soft
but have a light crackled crust. Cool cookies on the cookie sheets
for 2-5 minutes. Carefully remove the cookies to a wire rack to cool
completely. May use walnuts instead of pecans.
