Title: CHOCOLATE AMARETTO BROWNIES
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Shortening
4 oz Sq unsweetened chocolate
2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs; beaten
2 tb Amaretto
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
Handful sliced almonds
MMMMM---------------------AMARETTO FROSTING--------------------------
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
2 tb Half-and-half
1 oz Sq unsweetened chocolate
1 ds Salt
2 1/2 c  Powdered sugar, sifted
2 tb Amaretto
Note: 2/3 cup powdered baking cocoa can be substituted for the
chocolate squares. Combine shortening (Crisco butter-flavored is
good, or I've used margarine to be cholesterol-conscious) and
chocolate in heavy saucepan; place over low heat, stirring
constantly, until combined. Remove from heat and cool. Stir in eggs
and amaretto. Combine flour and salt; add to creamed mixture,
stirring well. Pour batter into a lightly greased 13 x 9 x 2" king
pan. Bake at 400 for 20 minutes; cool. Frost with Amaretto frosting,
sprinkle with sliced almonds (or arrange in flowery patterns). Cut
into squares. Note: 3 Tbs powdered baking cocoa can be substituted
for chocolate squares. Combine butter & chocolate in a heavy
saucepan; place over low heat and stir constantly until melted. Stir
in half and half. Add powdered sugar, salt, Amaretto, stirring until
smooth. Yield: Enough frosting for 2 dozen brownies. (Original recipe
