Title: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE PIE -1
Categories: Chocolate, Pies & past
Yield: 1 Servings
Crust-----
1 1/4 c  Chocolate Wafer Crumbs
1/2 c  Melted Butter -- or
Margarine
Mousse-----
8 oz Semisweet Chocolate --
Finely ground
1 oz Unsweetened Chocolate --
Finely ground
4 oz Heavy Whipping Cream
6 tb Unsalted Butter
2    Eggs -- separated
Bailey's Irish Cream --
Optional
CRUST:

Add butter to crumbs just until it will hold its shape when pressed
into a pan. I'm sorry but I've never bothered to measure the butter!

MOUSSE:

Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks forms.  Set aside. Heat the
cream and butter in a heavy saucepan or double boiler over medium
heat. When the butter is well-incorporated into the cream, add the
chocolates. Stir off the heat until melted and well-blended. Add the
egg yolks.

Quickly fold 1/4 of the chocolate mixture into the beaten whites,
then fold the whites into the chocolate.

Fill the crust with the filling and refrigerate several hours. If you
like you may add Bailey's Irish Cream to the filling to flavour and
whip cream with a tiny bit of sugar and some Frangelico liqueur.
Amaretto for the whipping cream is also nice. It's just a decadent
final touch to an alread-decadent dessert.
