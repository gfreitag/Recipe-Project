Title: CHOCOLATE CAKE MIX
Categories: Misc
Yield: 15 Cups
6 c  Flour; sifted
5 1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
5 1/2 ts Baking soda
2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 c  Vegetable shortening
Sift dry ingredients together.  Cut in shortening wiht a pastry
blender or two knives, or you can use your food processor for this
step.

Store mix in a tightly closed container on the pantry shelf.

Mix will keep for up to 6 months in dry weather.  If the weather is
hot and humid, keep this mix in the refrigerator.

Note: This mix can be kept handy on the pantry shelf and is very
convenient for a quick but rich treat. The basic chocolate cake from
your own mix can be varied by the addition of different kinds of
icings and fillings. Try spreading 1 cup of fruit preserves between
the layers before frosting, and sprinkle the top with shredded
coconut.
