Categories: Rosie's
Yield: 12 Servings
Light vegetable oil spray
8 oz Firm tofu
1/4 c  Part skim milk ricotta chees
4 oz Light cream cheese
1/4 c  Pure maple syrup
3 tb Cocoa powder, unsweetened
2 lg Egg whites
1 tb Ground cinnamon
3 tb Light Irish cream liqueur
1 tb Coffee liqueur
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE TOPPING---------------------------
1/2 c  Nonfat sour cream or plain

1 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 tb Honey
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 10-inch glass pie plate with 3
sprays of the vegetable oil. In the bowl of a food processor, combine
the tofu, ricotta cheese, cream cheese, maple syrup, cocoa powder,
egg whites, cinnamon, and the liqueurs. Puree until smooth and pour
into the prepared pie plate. Place the pie plate on the center rack
of the oven. On the bottom rack, place a baking pan filled halfway
with water. Bake for 1 hour. While the cake is baking, combine all
the topping ingredients in a small bowl and whisk thoroughly. When
the cake has cooked for an hour, remove it from the oven, spread the
topping on evenly, decorate if you wish, and return it to the oven.
Bake for about 10 minutes more, until the topping sets. Refrigerate
for 2 hours before serving. Decorate with the Chocolate Sauce Design
if you wish. Making a Chocolate Sauce Design: Put a mixture of 2
tablespoons pure maple syrup and 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
powder into a squeeze bottle or an improvised pastry bag, which can
be made by forcing the sauce into a bottom corner of a sturdy plastic
storage bag and pricking a small hole throught which it can flow.
Squeeze a series of straight lines across the cake, then rake the
tines of a fork across the top in the opposite direction to create a
pattern.
