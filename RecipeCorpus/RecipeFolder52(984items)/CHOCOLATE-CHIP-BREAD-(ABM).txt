This is untested.  For my Hitachi I would probably use less water
than this original recipe calls for.

Important to check the dough while kneading to see if additional
flour may be needed!!!

Depending on machine either your loaf will come out with most of the
chocolate chips whole, of if your bread machine warms up during
kneading and rising, the chocolate chips will melt to produce a
chocolate dough.

Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Add ingredients in the
order specified by your machine. Add chocolate chips at the
appropriate moment for your machine. Set bread machine on basic bread
making setting. If possible use light baking cycle, if not use normal
setting.
