Hi there!  I use this recipe in my bread machine but you could bake
it in two loaf pans just as easily. It's heavenly when it's warm and
spread with cream cheese! All I have to do is dump the ingredients
into the bread machine and press a button.  You'd have to knead, etc.
without one. Possible, but I have no pioneer spirit.

Enjoy!---Mary in SD Reformatted by Elaine Radis
