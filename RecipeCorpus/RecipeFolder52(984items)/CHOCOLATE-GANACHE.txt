Title: CHOCOLATE GANACHE
Categories: Chocolate, Desserts, Loo
Yield: 1 Batch
6 oz Semisweet chocolate;
-chopped fine
3/4 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Butter; unsalted
2 tb Sugar
Here are two I found on one of the echoes I host (ILink Chocolate).
Ganache, after all, is merely chocolate mixed with enough cream or
butter to make it spreadable. These are sub-recipes from Mrs. Fields,
I think, but they will work just about anyplace you need a smooth
spreadable chocolate. Bring cream and butter to a simmer. Stir in the
sugar. Pour cream over the chocolate in a bowl. Let stand covered for
5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Let cool to room temp.
