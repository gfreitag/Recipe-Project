Title: CHOCOLATE WALNUT BUTTER BREAD
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 32 Servings
1/2 c  Warm water
1 pk Yeast
3 1/2 c  Flour
1 tb Sugar
1 1/4 ts Salt
4 ea Eggs, room temp.
12 tb Butter, softened
1 c  Walnuts, chopped(lg. pieces)
6 oz Chocolate, semisweet *
* Use 6-one ounce squares, broken or chopped in large pieces. Put the
water in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Stir and
allow to stand for 5 minutes to dissolve. Add the flour, sugar, salt,
and eggs to the yeast mixture and beat vigorously until well blended.
Beat in the butter in Tablespoon sized pieces until it is all
incorporated and the batter is smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic
wrap and let the batter rise to double its bulk. Stir the batter down
and add the walnuts and chocolate pieces. Spoon the batter into two
greased 8 1/2x4 1/2x3-inch loaf pans (the pans should be half full so
the loaves will have nicely rounded tops when they finish baking)
Bake in a preheated 350 oven for about 45 minutes. Remove from the
oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes, then turn loaves out onto
racks. Makes 2 loaves; about 16 slices each. Source: The Breakfast
