*DIRECTIONS*

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir together first six ingredients. Add
the chips at the last moment so they won't get too crushed. Pour
batter into a greased and floured bundt pan. Bake at 350 degrees for
about 60 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool and
sprinkle top with confectioner's sugar.
