Categories: Cookies, Alcohol
Yield: 5 Dozen
-Natalie Canfield(sxnj32b)
1    Semisweet chocolate morsels
-(6 oz)
1/2 c  Bourbon
3 tb Light corn syrup
2 1/2 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
1/2 c  Powdered sugar; sifted
1 c  Pecans; finely chopped
Powdered sugar
Melt chocolate morsels in top of double boiler or in microwave. When
smoothly melted, remove from heat and stir in bourbon and corn syrup.
Set aside.  Combine crumbs, powdered sugar and pecans. Mix well. Stir
into chocolate mixture; let stand 30 minutes.  Shape into 1" balls.
Roll in sugar.  Store in an airtight container in refrigerator.
Yield: about 5 dozen.  Got this from December '84 issue of Southern
Living magazine. These are wonderful--now a holiday tradition at our
house! You can substitute english walnuts for the pecans. You can
also use rum instead of bourbon. I have tried several combinations,
but find the original the best to my taste.
