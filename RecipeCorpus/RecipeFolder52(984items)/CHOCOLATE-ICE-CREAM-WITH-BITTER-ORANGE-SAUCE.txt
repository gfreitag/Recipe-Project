ice cream maker. May be made 1 week ahead.

SAUCE: In a dry 1 quart heavy saucepan cook sugar, undisturbed, over
moderate heat until it begins to melt and continue to cook, stirring
with a fork, until melted completely and golden. Remove pan from the
heat and cool. While caramel is cooling, in a small saucepan of
boiling water blanch zest 15 seconds and drain. Return caramel to
moderate heat and add orange juice and zest, whisking until caramel
is melted completely. Whisk in preserves or marmalade until combined
well. Remove from heat and stir in liqueur. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
