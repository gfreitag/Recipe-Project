Author's Notes: You may have seen this on the cover of a recent
magazine when you were standing in the grocery line. It makes a very
rich, truly decadent chocolate cheesecake. A chocolate wafer is a
crisp chocolate cookie about three inches in diameter and an eigth of
an inch thick. If you can't find them, you can substitute any kind of
dry crunchy chocolate-flavored cookie. You can make the crust and
filling in a food processor if you have one. It makes it a lot easier.

Difficulty    : moderate. Precision
: measure carefully.
