Categories: Cheesecakes, Chocolate, Liquor, Creamcheese, Cakes
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Unslated butter; melted
6 oz Semisweet chocolate
1/4 c  Rum
1 lb Cream cheese
1/2 c  Sour cream
1 tb Vanilla
5    Eggs
Preheat oven to 325~. Butter inside of springform pan well & cover the
outside (bottom & sides) with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil,
shiny side out. This reflects heat away from cheesecake & prevents it
from baking too fast & becoming overcooked. Mix graham cracker crumbs
with 2 tb of the sugar & add melted butter. Press evenly on bottom &
sides of pan; refrigerate until ready to use. Cut chocolate into
small pieces. Melt in microwave; combine with rum. Set aside. Beat
cream cheese with electric mixer until ight & fluffy. Gradually beat
in sugar, sour cream & vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time. Mix well.
Place bowl over a pan of hot water & mix until smooth (do not let
water touch bottom of bowl). Pour about 1 1/4 cups of this batter
into a separte bowl & set aside. Whisk remaining batter w/the
chocolate, then stir over hot water until smooth. Take springform pan
from refrigerator & fill w/chocolate batter. Gently pour plain batter
over top & make swirls down into the chocolate batter with a fork.
Place on middle rack of oven & bake for 50 minutes. Cool to room
temp, remove foil & rim of pan & refrigerate overnight.
