2 1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup

Liquid coffee cream
1 lb Semisweet chocolate,
Melted (about 3 1/2 cups)

This is especially good with black walnuts- giving an old-fashioned
flavor to the fudge. Combine sugar, corn syrup, and heavy cream and
cook to 244 degrees F. Remove from heat and add semisweet chocolate,
marshmallow, Fondant, and vanilla. Beat by hand or in a mixer until
thick and creamy. Add walnuts. Spread in a 9x13-inch pan. Cut into
squares when mixture holds its shape. Makes about 80 pieces.
