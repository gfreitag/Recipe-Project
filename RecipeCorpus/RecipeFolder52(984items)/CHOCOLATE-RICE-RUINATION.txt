Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 cn Condensed milk (14 oz.)
2 oz Chopped semi-sweet
4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 c  Milk
2    Egg yolks
3 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Steamed boiled long-grained
1 ts Confectioners' sugar
1 c  Heavy or whipping cream
1    Piece of semi-sweet chocolat
1.  Preheat the oven to 325 F.  Butter a shallow souffle dish. 2.
Combine the condensed milk with the chocolate in a medium-sized
saucepan over low heat.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the
chocolate has melted, 5 minutes.  Gradually add the butter, and
stir until melted.  Remove the pan from the heat. 3. Whisk the milk
into the chocolate mixture. Beat in the egg yolks and 2 teaspoons of
the vanilla. Then stir  in the rice.  Pour the mixture into the
prepared souffle dish, and bake 30 minutes. The middle will be
slightly loose.
Cool on a wire rack.  Refrigerate, covered, until
well chilled. 4.  Before serving, beat the cream in a large bowl
thickened.  Add the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla
until slightly
and the
confectioners' sugar, and beat until stiff.  Pile the whipped
cream on top of the pudding.  Using a vegetable peeler, scrape the
piece of semi-sweet chocolate over the top to make chocolate curls.
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
