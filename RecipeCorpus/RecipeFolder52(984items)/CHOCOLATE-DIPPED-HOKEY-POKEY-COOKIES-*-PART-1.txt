Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM-------------------KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A------------------------
1/2 c  Sliced almonds
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 ts Pure almond extract
2 tb All-purpose flour
3 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
-chopped into 1/4" pcs
1    Egg white
1 ts Unsalted butter; melted
EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, small nonstick saute pan,
baking sheet, stainless steel bowl, rubber spatula, parchment paper,
cake spatula, pizza cutter, double boiler, instant-read test
thermometer.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast the almonds on a baking sheet
in a preheated oven until golden brown, about 8 minutes, then remove
from the oven and cool. Do not turn off the oven.

Combine the sugar, flour, egg white, butter, salt, and almond extract
in a stainless steel bowl. Stir the mixture until smooth. Gently fold
in the almonds until coated with the batter. Hold the batter at room
temperature for 20 minutes before using, stirring occasionally. This
is done in order to dissolve the sugar. If this step is bypassed, the
cookies will not have the desired taste and texture.

Trace 2  6-inch circles onto a piece of parchment paper (cut to fit a
baking sheet). Place the parchment paper, trace marks down, on a
baking sheet. Evenly divide the batter between the circles.
