Bittersweet chocolate
Melt bittersweet chocolate in a double boiler over hot water until
melted and liquid.  Line a cookie sheet with waxed paper and, using
washed and well dried strawberries, orange sections (all pith
removed-membranes left on), banana slices, glazed apricots or
peaches, blanched almonds, pecans, Brazil nuts, etc. Dip into
chocolate, allowing the excess to drip back into the pan.  Place
dipped items on >> waxed paper lined sheets & refrigerate until
chocolate is set. The banana slices have to be totally covered with
chocolate or they will blacken--use a fork to lower them into the
chocolate & then to remove them. The chocolate dipped fruits are >>
gorgeous as they are but sometimes I melt some white chocolate and
put it into a pastry bag with a tiny, plain tip and swirl some white
chocolate over the dark chocolate for an even more dramatic effect.
