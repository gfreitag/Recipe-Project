If you kids like the fruit gelatin snacks, they'll love these
chocolate snacks.

In a blender, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and let stand
for 5 minutes.  Add the boiling water and sugar, cover and blend on
low speed until the gelatin is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes.
Continue to blend, gradually adding small amounts of the chocolate
chips until the chips are melted and the mixture is smooth. Pour into
an 8- or 9-inch square pan. Refrigerate until firm and cut into
1-inch squares or shapes with cookie cutters.
