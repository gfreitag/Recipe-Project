Title: CHOCOLATE PINE NUT BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 24 Biscotti
2    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
2/3 c  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Cake flour
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Miniature chocolate chips
1/3 c  Pine nuts (pignoli)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, beat eggs with an
electric mixer on high speed until fluffy. Gradually beat in vanilla
and sugar until mixture is thick and lemon colored, scraping down
side of bowl frequently with a rubber spatula.

With a wire whisk, fold in cake flour mixed with cocoa powder, baking
powder, and salt just until thoroughly combined. Fold in chocolate
chips and pine nuts.

Grease a 10x4 inch strip  down center of 2 cookie sheets. Spoon half
of the chocolate mixture down center of each cookie sheet to make a
3x10 inch log. Bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven but leave oven on.

Let logs cool on sheets 3-5 minutes, or just until cool enough to
handle. With a serrated knife, cut each log diagonally into 12
slices. Place slices, flat sides down, on cookie sheets and return to
oven. Bake 5 minutes. Turn slices over and bake 5 to 7 minutes
longer, or until crisp on both sides. Remove to racks and let cool
completely before storing in an airtight container.
