Title: Chicken Marsala
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Olive oil,
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Marsala
4    Chicken; cutlets, skinless
1/4 c  Flour,
Salt & pepper
In a hot no-stick pan Dust chicken cutlets w/flour and saute in oil until
golden brown on both sides. Do it quickly and lightly. Remove from skillet
and set aside. Add 1/2 cup dry Marsala wine to the pan and scrape up the
brown bits that are on the bottom. Add 1/2 cup chicken stock and mix very
well, reducing the liquid in the pan by about 1/3. Return chicken to the
pan and heat through; about 2 minutes. Serve. A few T of butter could be
incorperated; but I hardly ever do. it does make the dish a bit richer.
