Karen Mintzias
30    Zucchini blossoms
3 tb Olive oil
4    Scallions, minced
1    Garlic clove; minced
1/3 c  Raw long grain rice
Soak the stems in cold water overnight, without soaking the blossoms.  The
following day, wash and drain on a towel.  Cut off and discard the stems
without breaking the blossoms, and set the blossoms aside while you make
the filling.  Heat the oil and saute' the scallions until soft.  Add the
garlic and rice and cook over moderate heat for 2 minutes stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the tomatoes, herbs, and enough
water to cover the rice, then season with salt and pepper and the sugar.
Simmer for 5 minutes, and remove from the heat.  Using a teaspoon, stuff
each blossom carefully, holding it in the palm of one hand, then close it
and lay it on its side in a buttered flameproof casserole large enough to
accomodate all the blossoms.  Continue until all are filled.  Pour 1 cup of
warm water into the casserole.  Invert a plate over the flowers, then cover
the casserole and simmer over lowest heat about 1-1/2 hours.  Check every
30 minutes to see if more water is needed; if so, add warm water (it should
all be absorbed when cooked).  Serve with poultry, meat or fish dishes, or
as a delightful first course.  From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma
