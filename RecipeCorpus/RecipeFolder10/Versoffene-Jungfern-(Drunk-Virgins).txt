Add the cinnamon and lemon peel to the red wine, and bring to a boil.

Reduce the liquid by keeping it at a light boil for 20 minutes.  Then
remove the cinnamon and lemon peel.  Season to taste with sugar, ground
cloves and, if desired, a bit of lemon juice.  Pour the sauce over the hot
dumplings and serve as dessert.
