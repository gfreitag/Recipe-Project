This has pleased many meat eaters at my table.  It's quite hearty.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.

Beat eggs.  Beat in Ricotta cheese until smooth.  Stir in the Parmesan and
spinach.  Season with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.

In loaf pan, place a thin layer of tomato sauce. Layer 1/2 each
