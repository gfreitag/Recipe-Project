Title: Yorkshire Pork Chops
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
3    Eggs
1 c  Flour
2 tb Melted butter
1/2 ts Salt
1    Lg golden delicious apple
4 tb Olive oil
4    Pork loin chops - 1-1/2 to 2
1 c  Milk
(Serve with warm applesauce.. OPTIONAL) Peel and slice the apple into 4
thick rings.  Melt the oil in an oven-proof pan, and brown them for about 1
minute on each side. Put an apple ring on each chop. Whisk the milk, eggs,
flour butter and salt until well mixed. Pour the batter over the chops and
bake for about 35 minutes at 450~ or until the batter is browned and puffy.
Serve immediately - with the warm applesauce. Since the Yorkshire batter
bakes with the pork chops, it swells up and around the chops and becomes
crisp on top, but stays soft and moist inside - like you think of yorkshire
pudding.  If you use thin chops they will tend to become dry and tough, so
best use thick ones for this recipe.
