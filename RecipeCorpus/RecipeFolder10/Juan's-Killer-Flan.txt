Title: Juan's Killer Flan
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Vanilla extract
1/2    Lemon; juice only
8    Eggs
1 cn Evaporated milk
1 cn Sweetened condensed milk
2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
Preheat oven to 375 . Mix eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, 1 cup of
the sugar, vanilla and lemon juice in large bowl. Mix well, no solids
allowed, and the sugar must blend very evenly. (Add a little bit of
Amaretto or Bailey's Irish Cream if you feel adventurous, or a little
softened cream cheese). In a meat loaf or bread mold, put the remaining 1
cup of sugar and the water tilt the mix so that becomes a syrupy mix. Heat
on high, watching it and moving it every once in a while to spread the heat
evenly. When it starts to turn brown, take it off the heat. The syrup
should be a medium caramel color. Put it in the freezer and let it set.
After the caramel sets, pour in the flan mixture you made in the bowl.
Cover TWICE and seal well with aluminum foil. Put the mold inside another
larger pan (double boiler) and fill the middle with water so that it almost
reaches the edge of the inside mold. It is VERY important to seal the top
of the mold; if steam or hot air gets inside the flan will not come out
creamy and firm (it will look like swiss cheese on the outside). Set oven
to BAKE and cook for 1 hour. Turn oven off and let it cool, then take the
flan out, remove from the larger pan and put it in the fridge to cool.
Ought to serve 8 or so, but I've seen it serve 1 over 3-days. It will last
quite a bit as long as it is refrigerated. +++++DON'T FORGET TO SEAL THE
PAN REALLY WELL! (BOOM! DIET'S DEAD!) Recipe from Juan Jiminez, GEnie
