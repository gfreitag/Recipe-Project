Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  Sherry
1/4 c  Brandy
2    Rock Cornish Game Hens, defr

Remove giblets from defrosted birds and discard.
Melt the butter in a heavy skillet with heat-proof handle. Season hens
with salt and pepper, then brown lightly all over in the butter, turning
frequently. This should take about 20 minutes. When hens are browned, add
sherry to the pan and transfer it to the oven.
Roast birds 45-60 minutes, until they are tender, basting often.
Transfer hens to heated (and heatproof) serving dish. Warm brandy in a
small saucepan and ignite it. Pour over the hens and serve flaming.

If you cannot get Rock Cornish hens, use squab, poussin (very young
chicken) or quail. These birds cook more quickly, so adjust the roasting
time accordingly.
