Title: Wiener Schnitzel
Categories: Veal, German
Yield: 6 servings
Salt
Flour
Beaten eggs (1 egg per two
-slices veal)
Fine dry bread crumbs
4 oz Veal slices (per person),
-milk fed, pink in color,
1/4    Inch thick
Olive oil
Lard
Trim all fat from veal. Pound each slice as thin as possible (about 1/8
inch thick). Make small vertical cuts all around the edges of the veal.
Salt each slice. Dip first into a soup plate containing flour, and shake
off excess; next into a soup plate of beaten egg; finally into a soup plate
containing dried bread crumbs, pressing crumbs well in with the palm of
your hand, then shaking off excess. Fry in deep fat, half olive oil, half
melted lard, so hot that it smokes, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or
until heat is right when the breading ripples golden brown. Schnitzel is
done and tender when a fork goes right through the meat. Serve garnished
with lemon wedges and potatoes or salad as a side dish.
