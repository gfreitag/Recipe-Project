cooked underground ala a Luau) (a substitute for the whole pig) Wash the
pork and rub with the season salt and rock of Kosher salt if you have it.
Sprinkle liberally with the liquid smoke. Wrap with the banana leaves and

cooking. Wrap in heavy duty foil and bake in a 250 degree over for
approximately 7 hours. I'll be back with more fairly soon.."Kapena" FROM:
