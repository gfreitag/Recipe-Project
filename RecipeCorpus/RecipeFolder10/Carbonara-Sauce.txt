Title: Carbonara Sauce
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 4 servings
Olive oil
Pepper
Salt
4 oz Salt pork or smoked bacon
1/3 c  Freshly grated Parmesan chee
4    Eggs
(1) Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the salt pork cut in small pieces, and
cook until golden brown.
(2) Beat the eggs just enough to mix the yolks and whites well. (You may
also use just the yolks alone.) (3) Add the grated cheese, a pinch of salt,
and pepper, > and continue stirring. Add a few tablespoons cream, if you
want to, to reach desired consistency. After the pasta is boiled and
drained, pour it into a large bowl.
(4)  Add the salt pork and the beaten eggs and cheese and mix everything
together very quickly.  Serve immediately. This sauce is especially good
with spaghetti or bucatini. Don't ask me what bucatini is - I'm just
quoting from the book!
