These bacon tarts can be made in two ways.  The dough base is always the
same, however, the topping is different.

Dough:

In a bowl, mix the flour and salt.  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in half
the lukewarm milk.  Form a well in the flour, and pour the yeast mixture
into this well.  Dust the liquid with flour, and cover the bowl.  Let rest,
in a warm spot, for 1/2 hour.  Then add the melted butter and knead and
beat the dough until it starts to form small bubbles.  Shape into rounds
that are about half a finger's width thickness and about 5 inches in
diameter.  Tweak the edges of the dough into a raised rim.  Cover the dough
circles with

A) egg yolk and then lightly press in the bacon and add the remainder of
the ingredients, OR

B) lard and then lightly press in the cracklings.  Season with salt.

Bake at medium heat for 30 minutes.  Serve hot.

Serves 4.
