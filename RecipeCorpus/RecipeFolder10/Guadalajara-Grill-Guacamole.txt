The VERY BEST guacamole I ever tasted was at the Guadalajara Grill in Old
Town San Diego.  They make it fresh, right at your table. (I recommend the
Haas avacodas).
Here's their recipe: Slice the avacodas in half, remove the pit and scoop
out the pulp with a spoon. Add all ingredients and mix gently,
crisscrossing two spoons in the bowl. The idea is to leave the avacoda in
small chuncks. Susan Husij
