Carmelize almonds by mixing with sugar and stirring constantly over low
heat until lightly browned. Cool on waxed paper and break into small pieces
and set aside. Combine dressing ingredients and mix wll. Refrigerate for a
few hours to marry the flavors. (That is to marry the flavors of the
dressing, not you and your guest) Just before serving, tear lettuce into
bite-size pieces and combine with celery, onions and mandarin oranges. Toss
with dressing and nuts and place on one larger piece of butter lettuce to
cradle the salad. This will serve 6 so I suggest you cut it in half. --From
