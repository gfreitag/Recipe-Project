Title: Trout
Categories: Fish/sea, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Maple syrup;  or honey
1 tb Dijon
Salt & pepper; to taste
4    Trout; butterflied
12    Figs; (never used them)
1 c  Sherry; dry(not cooking)
3 tb Vinegar; (sherry or mild)
Put 1st three ingredients in a non-reactive pan. Simmer for about 10
minutes. I skipped this step as I didn't use figs. I just simmered and then
wisked in the honey and mustard. Reduce by half. Brush on butterflied trout
and broil. We've done it on the grill too. Don't cook it to long. I f you
use the figs, take them out after you steep them for about a half hour. Put
them back in AFTER the reduction, enjoy, This is from TIME-LIFE, HEALTHY
HOME COOKING, Fresh Ways With Fish and Shellfish. We first used it on trout
and it is super and easy, and as a bonus, low in calories. WW; 4 Pt; 40 cal
