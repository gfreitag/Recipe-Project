Title: North Carolina Hush Puppies
Categories: Breads
Yield: 15 servings
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Buttermilk; *note
1/4 c  Water
1    Egg; beaten
1 c  Corn meal
1/4 ts Soda
1 tb Flour
1/4 ts Salt
Mix all dry ingredients together.  Then add egg, buttermilk, and water.
Drop by spoonful into hot deep fat. Fry to a golden brown. (If a deep pot
is used, the hushpuppy will float to the top when done).
*NOTE: If you don't want to buy buttermilk, substitute 1/2 c. milk with 1
T. lemon juice added. Stir and let it sit for 5 minutes. It works just as
well.  Please note: You can make variations of this recipe in several ways:
i.e., 1/4 c. finely chopped onion, less sugar, etc. But, at the coast of NC
the above type recipe is usually served. Judy Garnett, pjxg05a, Raleigh,NC
