Title: Marinated Shrimp
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Wine vinegar
1    Clove garlic
1/2    Bay leaf
1 tb Dry mustard
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Salt
Black pepper to taste
2 lb Shrimp peeled and cleaned
1    Lemon, thinly sliced
1    Onion, thinly sliced
1/2 c  Sliced pitted ripe olives
2 tb Chopped pimiento
1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/4 c  Oil
Boil shrimp. Drain, peel and clean.  Add lemon and onion slices, olives and
pimiento.  Toss.  In second bowl combine remaining ingredients and pour
over shrimp. Refrigerate overnight, stirring occasionally. Serve in
marinade and have toothpicks for spearing the shrimp. I found this in the
River Road Recipes II which is put out by The Junior League of Baton Rouge.
It is not only good, but easy.
