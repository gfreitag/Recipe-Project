THE CHICKEN WINGS, discard tips and heat the oil to a temperature of 375F
in a deep-sided pot. Rinse the chicken wings, and pat dry on paper towels.
Mix the butter with the Tabasco sauce, and set aside. Fry a batch at a
time, being careful not to crowd the pot. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, or
until golden brown. Drain in a single layer on paper towels, and repeat
until all wings are fried. As the wings are fried, roll them in the butter
mixture. Keep the wings warm in a 200F oven in a single layer. While the
wings are frying, make the dressing by combining the blue cheese,
mayonnaise, sour cream or yogurt, pepper, lemon juice and vinegar in a
small mixing bowl. Break up the cheese with a fork, but do not beat until
smooth. To serve, place the wings on a platter or plates, and serve with
the dressing and some celery sticks. Makes 36 pieces. The dressing can be
prepared up to two days in advance and refrigerated.
