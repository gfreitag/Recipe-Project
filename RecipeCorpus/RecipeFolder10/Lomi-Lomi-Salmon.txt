Title: Lomi Lomi Salmon
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
1    Medium yellow onion; chopped
8    Green onions
1 lb Salt Salmon
5    Large ripe tomatoes
I usually scoop the tomato insides out with a large melon baller attempting
to keep the outside shell of the tomato as intact as possible. Dice the
removed insides and place the diced tomatoes and their shells in the
refrigerator while proceeding with the recipe. Soak the salt salmon after
cleaning. Change the soaking water occasionally to drain off most of the
salt. After 3 to 5 hours of soaking remove all of the skin and the bones.
Cut the salmon into small pieces and placed in a bowl. Add the diced
tomatoes and also add the yellow onion which has been chopped into fairly
small pieces. Cover the mixture with ice cubes until ready to serve. Chop
the green onions very small and place them on top of the tomato mixture
that you will place in the tomato shells to serve. Just as you serve the
shells add a little crushed ice. FROM: THEODORE SEDGWICK (XPST31A)
