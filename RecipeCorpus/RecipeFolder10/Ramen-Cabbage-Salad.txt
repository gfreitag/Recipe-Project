Chop cabbage into small pieces, add sliced green onion to cabbage. Toast
sesame seeds and almonds on cookie sheet in oven. Be careful--they burn
very quickly!. Crush Ramen noodles* (Original Flavor) in package. Open and
remove broth package. Just before serving add crushed (uncooked) noodles,
sesame seeds and almonds to cabbage and onions. Dressing: Use a Good
Seasons salad dressing bottle--Add water, oil and vinegar as marked on
bottle. Add 1 package of Ramen seasoning and 1 T sugar. SHAKE WELL !!! Add

slaw loved it. Thank you Tom Hammond for supplying this great recipe. JL.
