Title: Medallions of Pork
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 servings
2 oz Butter; clarified
2 c  White wine
2 tb Butter; room temp
3 lb Pork tenderloin; in 2-oz.por
1 tb Corn oil
3 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Tomato paste; rounded
Begin the sauce early in the day by simmering the chicken stock.
Caramelize the tomato paste in clarified butter until it is very dark,
stirring frequently. Reduce the white wine to about 1/2 cup. Combine with
tomato paste and the chicken stock. Simmer for 10 minutes, strain, and set
aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 deg. In a large saute pan heat corn oil until it
is very hot (almost smoking). Place the medallions in the pan and sear
until brown. Using tongs and a spatula, quickly turn each medallion and
place the whole pan in the preheated oven. Bake 8 to 10 min. An internal
thermometer should register 150 deg.
While the medallions are roasting, reheat the sauce almost to a simmer.
If desired, cornstarch may be added at this point for a thicker sauce.
Remove meat from the oven and arrange on a serving platter. Take sauce from
the heat and swirl in 2 T. butter.  Pour over the meat and serve
immediately.
