CRACK LOBSTER CLAWS AND CUT BODY AND TAIL INTO FOUR OR FIVE PIECES. Saute

Simmer 20 minutes. Remove meat from lobster, reserving shells and broth.
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. Add flour. Cook, stirring
constantly for 2 minutes. Add 3 cups boiling milk all at once and whisk
until smooth. Crush lobster shells and add to sauce. Add reserve broth with
vegetables and simmer, covered, 1 hour. Strain through a sieve. Heat to
boiling and add 3 tablespoons cream. You can add a few drops of red food
coloring to give it that lovely pink color, if you wish. Add the lobster,
before serving, plus remaining cognac.
