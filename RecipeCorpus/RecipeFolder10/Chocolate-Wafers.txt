to 10-inch roll. Wrap each roll in 1 piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap.
Place wrapped rolls in plastic freezer container with a tight-fitting lid,
or wrap airtight in a 14 x 12-inch piece of heavy-duty foil. Label with
date and contents. Store in freezer.  Use within 6 months. YIELD: 4 rolls

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. Slice frozen
dough 1/4" thick and arrange on sheets 1/2" apart. Bake 8 to 10 minutes
until cookies are set on edges and slightly firm on top. Cool on racks.
