Title: Fettucini Florentine
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Chopped spinach
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
3 c  Heavy cream
3 tb Butter
1/4 lb Dried prosciutto
This is not authentic Florentine, but it sure is good. The recipe comes
from Julie Dannenbaum's "Italian, Fast and Fresh." REDUCE CREAM TO 1 1/2
CUPS. Heat butter in a large skillet. Saute prosciutto, 1 minute. Add cream
and chopped spinach and cook until thick enough to coat a spoon. Season
with salt and pepper and add Parmesan cheese. Makes enough for 1 pound
pasta.
