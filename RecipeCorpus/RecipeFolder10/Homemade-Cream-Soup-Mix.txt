Categories: Soups/stews
Yield: 9 servings
1 ts Basil leaves
1 ts Thyme leaves
1/2 ts Pepper
2 c  Powdered nonfat milk
3/4 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Instant chicken bouillon
2 tb Dried onion flakes
NOTE:  To use in place of canned cream soups in casseroles or as a base for
your own soups.  Much lower in fat and salt than the canned versions. The
trick is to have it made up ready to use!    Combine all ingredients,
mixing well.  Store in an airtight container until ready to use. To
SUBSTITUTE FOR ONE CAN OF CONDENSED SOUP: Combine 1/3 cup of dry mix with 1
1/4 cups of cold water in a saucepan.  Cook and stir until thickened. Add
to casseroles as you would the canned product. Makes equivalent of 9 cans
of soup. Source: The New American Diet, c1986
