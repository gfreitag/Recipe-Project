Title: Country Style Cream Soup
Categories: Soups/stews
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Whipping Cream (or 1/2-1/2)
1 ts Chervil, dried
1 ts Basil, dried
1 ts Tarragon, dried
3 tb Parsley, chopped fresh
3 c  Onion, Chopped
2/3 c  Unsalted Butter
3    Garlic Cloves, minced
2/3 c  Flour
8 c  Milk
3    Egg Yolks
Nutmeg, salt, white pepper Saute onion in butter in heavy skillet
until onions become soft and transparent, then add garlic and cook a few
minutes more. Stir in the flour and cook for about 3 minutes more--careful
not to scorch!  Pour the milk in and immediately wisk to blend. Add the
herbs and bring to boil stirring to avoid lumps. Simmer for at least 15
minutes.  Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, pepper. Before serving, whisk
the egg yolks into the cream then whisk the mixture into the soup. You can
substitute milk for the cream if you want a lighter soup. * This soup is an
excellent base for a wide variety of soups. I like to add fresh herbs and
sometimes some cheese to the soup. Chopped ham, turkey, or chicken
(leftovers), or any diced begetables can make an even meatier soup. If you
add pureed vegetables you might want to reduce the amount of flour to keep
the soup from getting too thick. * You can saute chopped vegetables
separately and add right after the milk is poured in for wonderful
vegetable cream soups.  Cabbage and Brussels Sprouts are two that work
particularly well. * The original of this recipe is from Francois Kissel
who had the Brasserie Pittsbourg in Seattle--an outstanding restaurant!
