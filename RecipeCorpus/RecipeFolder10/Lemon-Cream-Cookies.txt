Yield: 70 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Almonds; blanched, slivered
1/2 c  Sugar

Preheat oven to 350 deg. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or butter
them. Place almonds on baking sheet or pie plate and toast them in
preheated oven for about 4 mins. or just until they are crisp and faintly
colored. Set almonds aside to cool. Leave oven on. Place sugar in food
processor fitted with steel blade. Remove zest from lemons with a citrus
zester. Process zest and sugar until zest is grated, about 1 minute. Add
brown sugar, eggs and cream and process until very well mixed, 30 to 45
seconds. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of the batter on the prepared cookie
sheets, leaving 1 1/2 inches between cookies, then sprinkle the top of each
cookie with 2 or 3 pieces of toasted slivered almonds. Bake in center of
oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cookies are golden brown. Transfer
cookies to racks to cool. Store in airtight containers for up to 3 days;
the cookies can be frozen for up to 2 months. Judy Garnett/Raleigh, NC
