Title: Roast Wild Duck or Quail
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
----------------------------------RECIPE F----------------------------------
Soak one large duck or 2 mallards in marinade (See Page 57) overnight in
refrigerator. Season inside and out with salt and pepper. Brown well in
lightly oiled skillet to remove excess fat. Stuff each cavity with 2
chopped potatoes, 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped apples (this stuffing,
discarded after cooking, absorbs unwanted fat and wild flavor). Place 2 cut
up carrots in bottom of CROCK-POT to act as rack for bird(s). Put stuffed
duck(s) in pot. Add 1/2 cup sauterne, dry vermouth or water. Cover and cook
on High 2 hours, then turn to Low for 8 hours. Before serving, remove
chopped vegetables from each cavity. Serve with rice, baked sweet potatoes
or potatoes. NOTE: If ducks have been skinned, pin 2 bacon strips across
each breast and place under broiler 10 to 15 minutes before serving
