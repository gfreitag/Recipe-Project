Title: Duck Braised with Olives
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Red wine
1 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Basil
1 c  Olives pitted split
1    Large DUCK
1 c  Onions minced
1/2 lb Bacon, cut in small pieces
2 tb Celery, heart, minced
3 tb Green bell pepper, minced
Directions: Split the ducks, rinse and pat dry. In a large pan,brown the
duck halves in oil, skin side down and turn and brown the other side. Pour
off all but 2 tbs of drippings (the domestic duck will render some extra
fat) and add the onions, garlic and bacon. Cook slowly until the bacon is
brown and pour off the extra fat again. Add the carrots, celery and bell
pepper. Cook for a minute or two and add the stock, wine, mustard, tomato,
bay leaf, basil and thyme. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer.
Cover and cook for 30 minutes and add the olives. Cover and cook very
slowly until the duck is very tender (time depends on origin and size of
duck). Serve with wild rice.
