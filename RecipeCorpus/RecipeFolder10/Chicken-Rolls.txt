Title: Chicken Rolls
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Minced garlic
6    Slices ham
1/3 c  Flour
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
6    Chicken breast
2 ts Dried sage
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
PLACE A CHICKEN BREAST between two sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap and
pound to an even thickness of 1/4-inch with the bottom of a small skillet
or the blunt side of a meat mallet. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts.
Mix the sage with the salt, pepper and garlic. Rub the mixture on one side
of the chicken breasts. Place a slice of ham over the seasoning, and then
roll the chicken breast into a spiral. Secure the spiral closed with
toothpicks or by tying them with string. Rub the rolls lightly with flour,
shaking off any excess. Pour the oil into a skillet, and heat it over
medium heat. Add the chicken rolls, being careful not to crowd the pan, and
cook until golden brown on the bottom. Turn with tongs, and cook until all
sides are brown, and the chicken is cooked in the center, about 15 to 20
minutes. Drain on paper towels, and serve immediately. Serves 6.
