Title: COOKING WINTER SQUASHES
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Squash
x  Apples
x  Cranberries
x  Water
Cut open squash (cut in half or into chunks), scoop out seeds. Lay
cut-side down in a baking pan.  Peel and core 1 or 2 apples; slice,
and scatter the apple slices in with the squash. Scatter a handful or
two of cranberries around with the squash and apples.  If you like
your squash a bit moist, add a tablespoon or two of water to the
bottom of the pan (I don't do this; my husband does).  Cover the pan
with aluminum foil and bake at 400F for 1 hour, or until a fork stuck
into the hard outside shell meets with no resistance.  Scoop the
squash out of the rind, scoop up a bit of the apple and cranberries
on the side, and enjoy!
