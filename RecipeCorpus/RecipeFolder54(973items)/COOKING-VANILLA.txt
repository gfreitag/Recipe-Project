Title: COOKING VANILLA
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Bottle Straight
Bourbon Whisky -- (750 ml)
4    Vanilla beans
Slit open the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds out.
Place the split beans into the bottle, along with the seeds that were
scraped out. Shake well. The flavor will come out after about a month
or two. Keep shaking and sniffing the bottle. As soon as it starts to
smell sweet it's ready for cooking and baking. A great idea would be
to make an additional bottle this year so it will be ready for all
your holiday baking next year. Or, for a great gift to a fellow cook,
poor some into a decorative bottle with an additional bean inside and
wrap a ribbon around it. Remember, the longer the beans ferment in
there, the stronger the vanilla flavor you will have.
