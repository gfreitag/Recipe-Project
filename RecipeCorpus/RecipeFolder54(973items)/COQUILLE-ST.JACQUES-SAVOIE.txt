* Bouquet Garni - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. In a large
saucepan combine the wine, onion, Bouquet Garni and peppercorns.
Season with salt and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Add the
scallops. Cover the saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove the
pan from the heat. Drain the scallops and keep them warm. In a bowl
beat the mustards, tomato paste and lemon juice into a smooth paste.
Add the egg yolks to the mustard mixture and beat until it is light
and creamy. Melt the butter in the top part of the double boiler over
hot water. The butter should be warm, NOT hot. Keep the water
simmering and slowly whisk the yolk mixture into the melted butter.
The sauce should get thick and creamy. Be sure not to let it come to
a boil or the yolks will curdle.  Remove the sauce from the heat.
Season it with salt and pepper.  Add the parsley, capers and finally
the warm well-drained scallops.  Serve immediately, garnished with
chives and lemon quarters. Note:  In certain regions of France this
course is served surrounded by boiled potato balls and buttered
carrots.
