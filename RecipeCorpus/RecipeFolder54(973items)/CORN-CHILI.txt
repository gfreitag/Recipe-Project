Cut kernels from corn cobs and set aside; you should have 2 cups of
whole kernels. With the back of a knife, scrape down cobs to remove
liquid and pulp. Reserve in a small bowl; you should have a 1/2 cup
of corn puree.

Soak chilies in hot water to cover until soft. Drain, reserving
soaking liquid. In a blender combine chilies, cumin, coriander,
oregano and tortillas. Blend, adding just enough reserved chile
liquid to make a thick paste. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high
heat. Pour in chile paste and fry for about 3 minutes, or until it
thickens. Add onion, garlic and corn kernels and fry 2 minutes more.
Add corn puree, beer and chicken stock. Bring to a boil, and simmer
for 40 minutes, or until mixture is thick and flavorful. Season to
taste with salt and lime juice
