GUIDANCE:

1.) After procurement actions, decontainerize inputs. Perform
measurement tasks on a case-by-case basis.  In a mixing type bowl,
impact heavily on brown sugar, granulated sugar, softened butter and
shortening. Coordinate the interface of eggs and vanilla, avoiding an
overrun scenario to the bes of your skills and abilities.

2.) At this point in time, leverage flour, baking soda and salt into
a bowl and aggregate.  Equalize with prior mixture and develop
intense and continuous liaison among inputs until well-coordinated.
Associate key chocolate and nut subsystems and execute stirring
operations.

3.) Within this time frame, take action to prepare the heating
environment for throughput by manually setting the baking unit (by
hand) to a temperature of 375 degrees =F8F (190 degrees C). Drop
mixture in an ongoing fashion from a teaspoon type instrument in an
ongoing fashion onto an ungreased cookie sheet at intervals
sufficient enough apart to permit total and permanent separationof
throughputs to the maximum extent practicable under operating
conditions.

4.) Position cookie sheet in bake situation and surveil for 8 to 10
minutes or until cooking action terminates. Initiate coordination of
outputs within the cooling rack function. Containerize, wrap in red
tape and disseminate to authorized staff personnel on a timely and
expeditious basis.

OUTPUT: Six dozen official government chocolate chip cookie units.
