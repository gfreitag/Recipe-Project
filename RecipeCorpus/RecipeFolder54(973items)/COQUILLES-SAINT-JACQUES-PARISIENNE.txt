Bring to a boil 1 1/2 cups dry white wine with a bouquet garni. Add 2
pounds scallops and salt to taste and simmer the scallops for 3
minutes, or until they are tender. Drain them, reserving the broth,
and cut them into fine pieces

Clean and chop 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms.  Put them in a saucepan
with the shallots or onion,  2 Tablespoons each of butter and water,
1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, and lemon juice. Cover the pan
and simmer the mixture for 10 minutes.  Strain it and add to the wine
broth.

Melt 1/4 cup butter in a saucepan, add 1/4 cup flour, and stir the
roux until it is well blended.  Add gradually the combined hot broths
from the scallops and the mushrooms and cook the sauce, stirring
constantly, until it is thickened and smooth.  Remove the saucepan
from the heat and stir in egg yolks beaten with the heavy cream and a
little of the hot sauce. Correct the seasoning and stir in the
scallops, shallots, and mushrooms. Fill scallop shells or ramekins
with the mixture, piling them high in the center, sprinkle with bread
crumbs and dot with butter. Brown the filling in a hot oven (400F) or
under the broiler.
