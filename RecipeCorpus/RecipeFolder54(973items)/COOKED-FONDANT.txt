5 c  Sugar
1 c  Coffee Rich or Half & Half
1 c  Cream (no sub!)
4 tb Margarine or butter
1/2 ts Cream of Tartar
Combine butter, sugar, Coffee Rich, cream & Cream Of Tartar in a heavy
saucepan. Stir until sugar is well moistened. Place on high heat.
Bring to boil then cover mixture for 2-3 minutes (to prevent sugar
crystals from forming). Uncover & place thermometer in boiling
mixture. COOK WITHOUT STIRRING. Wipe any crystals from sides of pan.
Cook to exactly 236 degrees. Immedietely pour out onto a marble slab.
When heat is no longer coming from the mass of candy...test it with
your finger tips or wrist...when the dents made with your fingers
remain for a little time instead of filling in immedietely & candy is
luke warm, candy is ready to work. Work fondant with candy paddle
until it sets up. Allow it to rest 15 minutes, covered. Then knead it
until perfectly smooth. Like magic, the "crumbs will turn to
wonderful creamy candy!
Form into a ball, place on Saran wrap & into a bowl that can be
tightly sealed.
This fondant is best if kept a day or so before using, but may be
used I Hints:   For stiffer fondant, cook 1-2 degrees more. Freezing
makes it sticky.
