1/3 c  Finely chopped cilantro
2 tb Tahini
2 tb Miso
1 ts Dark sesame oil
3 tb Orange juice
1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
2    Green onions, finely chopped
1/2    Red bell pepper, minced
4 c  Cooked udon or soba noodles
-drained, rinsed and drained
-again
This can be prepared a day ahead. The bit of tahini (sesame paste)
creates a creamy sauce that contrasts well with the crisp vegetables.

In a large bowl, combine cilantro, tahini, miso, oil, orange juice,
and red pepper flakes. Toss in green onions, bell pepper and noodles.

Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and chill 3 hours or over- night. Serve
cold.
