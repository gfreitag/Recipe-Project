Title: COLCANNON #3
Categories: Irish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 lb Potatoes (cooked, mashed)
1 c  Cooked kale (finely chopped)
1 c  Hot milk
4    Chopped scallions (optional)
Butter
Strip the heads of kale away from the stems and shred them finely.
Kale is a tough vegetable which needs to cook for 10-20 minutes
depending on its age.  Cook as you would for any green vegetable in
furiously boiling salted water until it is just tender.  (Some people
add 1/2 tsp baking soda to the water to help keep the kale at its
brightest green.) Strain it and refresh it with cold water. Drain it
thoroughly and squeeze out any excess water. Nowadays I put the kale
into a food processor with the hot milk and blend them into a green
soup which I then mix through the mashed potatoes. I then reheat it
in the oven until it is very hot. This produces a dish fit for St.
Patrick's Day in greenness. It is perfectly acceptable just to mix
the kale and milk into the potatoes without recourse to the food
processor, but the resulting dish is just speckled green. Do not use
the processor if you are making colcannon with cabbage instead of
kale. Don't forget the coin and the ring to amuse the children.
