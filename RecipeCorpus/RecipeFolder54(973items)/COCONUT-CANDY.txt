Title: COCONUT CANDY
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Milk
3 c  Grated coconut
Boil the sugar and milk over a medium heat until it forms a thin
syrup. (232 to 240 degrees on your candy thermometer) Add grated
coconut, stirring frequently to prevent burning. When mixture
thickens, drop by the spoonful onto a piece of waxed paper and allow
to cool. This will make 24 nice pieces.

A drop of your favorite seasonal food coloring can be added for
variety.
