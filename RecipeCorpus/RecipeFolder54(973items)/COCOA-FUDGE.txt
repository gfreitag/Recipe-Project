Title: COCOA FUDGE
Categories: Desserts, Candies
Yield: 12 Servings
2/3 c  Cocoa
3 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream or non-dairy
Liquid cream substitute
1/4 c  Butter
1 ts Vanilla
A good basic chocolate fudge. The use of whipping cream or non-dairy
cream substitute makes stirring unnecessary. This makes a very creamy
fudge. Combine cocoa, sugar, salt, and heavy cream in a large
saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil; then reduce heat to medium and
cook to 234 degrees F. without stirring. Remove from heat and add
butter and vanilla. Do not stir. Cool to lukewarm (about 110 degrees
F.). Beat by hand or with mixer until fudge thickens and loses some
of its gloss. Quickly spread fudge in lightly buttered 8-inch square
pan. When cool, cut into squares. Makes about 49 pieces.
