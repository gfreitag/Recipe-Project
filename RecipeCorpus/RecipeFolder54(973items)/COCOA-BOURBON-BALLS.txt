Title: COCOA BOURBON BALLS
Categories: Christmas, Cookies, M. c.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Vanilla wafer cookies,
-finely crushed
1 c  Confectioner's sugar
2 tb Cocoa
1 c  Pecans, finely chopped
2 tb Corn syrup
1/2 c  Bourbon
Combine dry ingredients and mix well. Add corn syrup and bourbon and
mix well. If too moist add a few cookie crumbs, if too dry add a
little more bourbon. Shape into small balls and roll in fruit sugar
or fonely chopped pecans. I also roll some in cocoa powder. Store in
an airtight container.

NOTES : Also good made with dark rum. One year I made with Southern
Comfort and everyone liked them.
