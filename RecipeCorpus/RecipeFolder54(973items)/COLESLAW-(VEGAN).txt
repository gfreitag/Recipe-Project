What makes coleslaw really good is the "pickling" of the cabbage.
First you slice the cabbage real thin layering it in a bowl with a
generous amount of salt (you will eventually wash all this salt
away), then you place the cabbage/salt mixture in a warm place for a
few hours until the cabbage is wilted and well...pickled. My father
used to place the cabbage directly on top of one of the big
refrigerator compressors in the back room. Once "pickled" thoroughly
wash to remove as much salt as possible.

Add optional ingredients as desired.

Now for the dressings.  Mayo is out but there are lots of
alternatives. Balsamic or rice vinegar to taste (if you pickle the
cabbage first you'll need less vinegar). Or, vinegar, ginger and
sugar and roasted mustard seed (add a nice look and crunch, to roast
the mustard seed, heat a heavy saute pan and add the seed to the hot
dry pan for about 30 seconds to a minute). Or, vinegar, and a good
dijon mustard.

Remember to let the slaw sit in its dressing for a while before
serving. Recipe from Veggie Life recipe archives Submitted by Nancy
