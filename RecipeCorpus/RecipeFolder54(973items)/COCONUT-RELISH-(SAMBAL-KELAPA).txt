1/4    Fresh coconut
1 sl Terasi
1    Clove garlic
3    Cabe rawit *
Salt
1 sm Piece of gula Jawa or:
2 ts Brown sugar
1 tb Tamarind water or:
1    Kaffir lime, juice only or:
1    Lime, juice only
* This is the minimum amount of cabe rawit; if you like your sambal
really hot, put in 6 or 8 cabe rawit instead of 3. But remember that
cabe rawit is the hottest and fiercest of all the chilli family.

This sambal is made from fresh coconut, and should be eaten on the
same day.

Separate the white flesh of the coconut from all trace of the brown
outer skin, then grate it. Grill or fry the terasi, and then pound
it, together with the garlic, cabs rawit and gula jawa into a paste.
Add the tamarind water, or juice, season with salt, and mix the paste
thoroughly with the grated coconut. Serve.
