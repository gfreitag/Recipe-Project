Title: COCONUT CHICKEN SOUP
Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 6 Servings
1 cn Coconut milk
4 c  Chicken stock
1 md Chicken
1 c  Whipping cream
4 sl Galangal
1    Lime or lemon
pn Of chili powder
Salt
A very simple one...

Heat stock and add galangal, chili, whipping cream and coconut milk.
Cut chicken up into bite size pieces. As soon as the mixture begins
to boil, add the chicken pieces and squeeze in the lemon or lime
juice and salt to taste.  The trick is to add the chicken right when
the mixture starts to boil.  Don't let the milk really boil. Cook the
chicken for a very short time, about half a minute.

Serves 6.

NOTE:  I must admit that when I typed this recipe, I missed the
amount of coconut milk to use.  The one can is a guess++that's how
much I would use, at least on the first try.
