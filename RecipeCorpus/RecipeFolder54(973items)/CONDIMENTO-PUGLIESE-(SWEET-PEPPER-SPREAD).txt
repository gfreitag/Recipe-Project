Title: CONDIMENTO PUGLIESE (SWEET PEPPER SPREAD)
Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Sauces, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lg Red bell peppers, roasted
1 tb Olive oil
1/8 ts Red pepper flakes
Salt & pepper, to taste
Roughly chop the roasted peppers.  Set them in a food processor & add
the remaining ingredients.  Pulse until you have a slightly chunky
mixture. Be careful not to puree the mixture otherwise it will be too
fine. If you don't have a processor, finely dice the ingredients by
hand & mix them together.  Taste for seasonings & spread on crostini
or use a pasta sauce.
