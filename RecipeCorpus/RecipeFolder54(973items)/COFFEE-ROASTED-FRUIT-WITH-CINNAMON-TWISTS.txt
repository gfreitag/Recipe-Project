In a large, wide nonreactive saucepan, combine the coffee, brown
sugar, zest and juice of the oranges, ginger, and cinnamon stick and
bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 4 minutes. Add the
apples and return to the simmer. Gently simmer until the apples is
cooked through and tender, testing the fruit with a toothpick. Add
the bananas for a minute or so jut to heat through. The cooking time
will vary greatly depending on the type and size of fruit used. When
tender, remove from the heat. Scoop 1 cup of the poaching liquid into
a small saucepan. Leave the fruit in their liquid while making the
sauce.

Dissolve the cornstarch in the orange juice and add to the small
saucepan containing the cup of poaching liquid. Bring to a simmer and
cook for 3 minutes until lightly thickened. Remove from the heat and
set aside to cool.

Serve the fruit sliced in shallow bowls or on plates. Spoon some of
the sauce over and around the slices; garnish with 2 or 3 orange
segments and mint sprigs. Serve the Cinnamon Twists on the side.
