NOTES : This appetizer tastes best when the vegetable is overcooked.
Best price on Green Giant Asparagus Spears is restaurant supply and
buyers coops (like Price Club). Add a little fresh lemon juice to
refresh after draining and cutting. Oven rack in center position. Use
reduced fat or fat free cheese. Nutr. Assoc.
