Title: CORN BISCUITS
Categories: Breads--qui, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Butter, softened -- at room
Temperature
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
2    Eggs at room temperature
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (approx)
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Stir the butter into a soft
mass; slowly add sugar, blending together well. Add cornmeal, eggs,
and salt. Beat until the mixture is smooth; add 1-1/4 c. flour (the
mixture will be soft and moist).  Roll the dough out to 1/4"
thickness; if the dough is too sticky to roll, add 1/4 c. flour and
blend into the top of the dough with your hands (I find it's also
easier if you roll out on a lightly floured board).  Cut out 4 dozen
1-1/2" rounds with a cookie cutter (I've also used squares, etc. --
whatever cutters I had handy at the time). Place close together on a
lightly greased baking sheet, but don't let them touch. Bake on
center shelf for about 22 minutes or until biscuits are just starting
to turn slightly brown around the edges. Near the end of this baking
period turn the baking sheet around for even cooking. If the biscuits
near the outer edges of the sheet are browning too fast then just
remove them if they're done or rearrange the biscuits on the sheet so
the brown-er ones get moved to the center. Remove biscuits from the
oven and cool on a rack. These are wonderful served warm; they freeze
very well and can be warmed up when ready to serve.

If not freezing them, keep at room temperature in an airtight
container. Kept this way the biscuits will last up to 10-14 days.

These biscuits are terrific served with coffee or tea, or with a dish
of fresh fruit.  They are slightly sweet with a wonderful, grainy
texture due to the cornmeal in the recipe. They're quite addictive.

(makes 4 dozen, but they don't last long!)
