1 1/4 c  Flour
3/4 c  Yellow Cornmeal
1/4 c  Granulated Sugar
4 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Salt
1    Egg; slightly beaten
1 c  Milk
1/3 c  Butter; melted
----OR----
1/3 c  Vegetable Oil
Corn Bread from Scratch 2 to 3 hours

Corn bread mix is so successful you really don't need to make it from
scratch, but it costs more than a hand-mixed version. I grease the
mold for corn bread with bacon drippings.

To Cook: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar,
baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center. Turn the egg,
milk, and melted butter or oil into the well and beat into the dry
mixture until just moistened. Turn into a greased 2-quart mold, cover
with a plate, and place on a trivet or rack in the bottom of the slow
cooker. Cover the cooker, cook on high for 2 to 3 hours. Makes 6
servings.
