This recipe is 'supposedly' from GREENWALD'S SUPER DELICATESSEN,
Louisville, KY. It was in LOVE AND KNISHES; Sara Kasdan; 1956. Sara
says it comes from a 'hamish' deli; (very homelike) in a poor
neighobrhood. Doubtful it still exists. And my copy of the book is on
its way out too!!! OK here goes...Place brisket in a large stoneware
crock and cover completely with water. Add remaining ingredients,
stirring to distribute them evenly (I   would add more garlic and
more peppercorns; never enough in the mix) Let it stand at room temp
for 4 days. place in the fridge for 16 days.   Remove from the crock
and place in a large kettle. Cover with boiling water and boil for 1
1/2 hours. Turn off heat and let stand in water in which it has
cooked for at least 2 hours. Remove meat to another deep kettle.
Place in sink and let cold waater run into the kettle (not directly
ON the meat) for 1 hour. (this seals the meat juices) Remove brisket
from the water and refrigerate unntil ready to use. If you serve hot;
steanm...do NOT boil. Well let me add that she quotes Mr. Greenwald.
"You have to be crazy to go to all this trouble when you can buy at
Greenwald's fancy new delicatessen." Mr. Greenwald is right...you
HAVE TO BE CRAZY; but if you can't get it any other way...this sounds
KOSHER to me. Perhaps one of our great Kosher cooks can come up with
a more modern method, <grin>!!!  Oh yes, the deli moved after WWII to
the Highland section...a fancy, 'shmancy' neighborhood.
