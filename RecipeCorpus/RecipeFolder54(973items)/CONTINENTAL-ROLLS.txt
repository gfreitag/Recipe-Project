Title: CONTINENTAL ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 20 Rolls
2 c  Water; warm (not hot)
1 pk Dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
6 c  All-purpose flour (approx)
Shortening (soft)
1    Egg white; unbeaten
Measure warm, not hot, water into bowl.  Sprinkle dry yeast over
water; stir until dissolved.  Add sugar, salt, and 3 cups flour. Stir
to mix; then beat until smooth. Stir in 3 cups more flour.

Turn dough out onto lighlty floured board.  Knead until smooth and
elastic, about 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, and brush the top
with soft shortening. Cover. Let rise in warm place, free from draft,
until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down and turn out onto lightly floured board. Divide
dough in half.  Form each half into a roll about 10 inches long.
Cover and let rest 5 minutes. Cut into 10 equal pieces and form into
smooth balls. Place balls about 3 inches apart on a lightly greased
baking sheet. With scissors, make a cross 1/2 inch deep in the top of
each roll by making two snips at right angles to each other. Cover
and let rise until doubled.

Bake at 425 degrees for 15 ot 20 minutes.  Remove from oven. Brush
rolls with egg white and reutrn to oven for 2 minutes. Remove from
baking sheet. Serve either hot or cold.

Note: This makes a crusty roll very similar to the long loaves found
in France.
