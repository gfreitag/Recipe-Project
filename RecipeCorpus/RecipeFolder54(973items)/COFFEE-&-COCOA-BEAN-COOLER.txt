(nonalkalized)
14 oz Can Sweetened Condensed Milk
3 c  Water
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1 1/2 c  Heavy Cream

1/2 c  Dark Rum -- (optional)

Make the drink base:

1. Crush the coffee beans coarsely with a rolling pin. In a medium
saucepan, combine the crushed coffee beans, cocoa powder, and water.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce
the heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes. Add the sweetened condensed
milk and stir to combine.

2. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a metal bowl set in a
larger howl filled with ice water. Discard the coffee beans.
Refrigerate the coffee mixture until well chilled, at least 2 hours.
The coffee and cocoa bean drink may be brewed and chilled the day
before.

Assemble and garnish:

1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer
fitted with the wire whip attachment, whip the cream, sugar and
vanilla at medium-high speed until soft peaks begin to form. Fill a
pastry bag fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #6) with the whipped
cream. Refrigerate until ready to use.

2. If desired, stir the rum into the mixture. Divide the mixture in
half. Pour half into a blender container and add 3/4 cup of the
crushed ice. Cover and blend at high speed for 30 seconds. Pour into
4 tall 16-ounce glasses. Repeat with the remaining crushed ice and
coffee mixture.

3. Pipe a large rosette of whipped cream to float on top of the brewed
coffee and cocoa bean drink. Garnish with the chocolate shavings.
Serve immediately.

8    Servings.

PREPARATION: 20 minutes plus cooling time.
