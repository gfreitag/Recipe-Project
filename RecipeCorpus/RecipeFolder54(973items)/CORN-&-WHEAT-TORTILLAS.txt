Title: CORN & WHEAT TORTILLAS
Categories: Flatbreads, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Stone ground corn meal
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Boiling water
1/2 ts Salt
Pour the boiling water over the corn meal. Let sit ten minutes or
more. Mix salt and whole wheat flour. Add enough flour to the corn
meal mixture to make a kneadable dough. Knead 5 to 10 minutes. Let
sit 5 minutes. Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a
golfball. Roll out on a floured board to a more or less round shape
about 4 inches in diameter. Cook on an unoiled hot griddle or heavy
skillet, about 2 minutes on each side. You can salt the griddle to
keep the tortillas from sticking, but it is not really necessary. I
also like these cut into wedge shapes and deep fried in very hot
oil(corn chips) and served with guacamole, hot salsa or refried beans
and cheese(or all of the above). From The Deaf Smith Country
