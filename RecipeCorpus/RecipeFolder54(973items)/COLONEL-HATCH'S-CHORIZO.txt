Title: COLONEL HATCH'S CHORIZO
Categories: Meat
Yield: 20 Servings
1/2 c  Hatch red enchilada sauce
3 ts Oregano
1/2 c  Dried red chiles; ground
2 1/2 lb Lean ground beef (or half
-beef; half pork, ground)
Colonel Hatch's Chorizo (from the Hatch Chile Cookbook)

NOTE: Use only ground beef or beef and pork mixture in this recipe.

Mix the enchilada sauce and the oregano with the ground chile. Put
the meat in a large glass bowl or non-reactive pan. Cover the meat
with the sauce and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Next, pour
off any excess liquid. To cook, crumble the desired amount with a
fork and fry in a skillet. The chorizo may be frozen into serving
size packages, or may be stuffed into sausage casings. Makes 40
sausages. *Please note: recipe requires advance preparation.

Dot's notes: I used half ground beef, half ground pork, dried
oregano, and Hatch-brand enchilada sauce. Now you know why I'm always
on the prowl for Hatch-brand stuff in Michigan. This recipe makes a
lot of chorizo. I divided it into some 4 and some 8 oz. portions,
wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil and froze it.
It makes absolutely wonderful breakfast burritos and you can also use
it in the Blue Cornbread and Chorizo stuffing recipe found in Steven
Pyle's New Texas Cuisine. Enjoy.
