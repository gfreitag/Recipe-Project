Title: COLESLAW (CARTER FAMILY FAVORITES)
Categories: Salads
Yield: 12 Servings
2 ea Green cabbage heads,fresh*
2 ea Apples,crisp,peeled/cored
6 ea Crisp celery stalks
6 ea Carrots,scraped/washed
1 tb Celery seed
1 ts Salt
1 pt Mayonnaise
* - don't bother if the cabbage is the white limp variety - your slaw
won't be worth the makings.

1. Cut the cabbage in quarters, place in a large bowl of well-salted
cold water, and let stand for at least 1 hour. This is to make sure
any possible "critters" emerge - nothing spoils good slaw like a
many-footed friend. Once soaked, drain and place the cabbage on a
large chopping board and chop away like mad. The cabbage must be very
finely shredded. Dump into a big bowl and shred the apples, celery,
and carrots. Add to cabbage, stir in celery seed, salt, and
mayonnaise, and blend well. 2. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before
serving to allow flavors to mellow. If slaw is to be transported to
fish fry site, keep very cold - mayonnaise mixture can be deadly if
allowed to stand too long at room temperature.
