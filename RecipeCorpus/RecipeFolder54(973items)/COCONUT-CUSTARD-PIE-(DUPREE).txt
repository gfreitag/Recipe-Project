Title: COCONUT CUSTARD PIE (DUPREE)
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 4 Servings    1 1/2 c  heavy cream
1 1/4 c  milk
3/4 c  sugar
6 TB cornstarch
2 lg egg yolks
1 ts vanilla extract
2 c  shredded coconut
Meringue topping
:
5 lg egg whites, -- at room
temperature
:
1/2 c  sugar
1/2 ts cream of tartar
1    prebaked pie crust

Combine the cream and 1/2 cup of the milk in a saucepan with the
sugar. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the
sugar, until small bubbles form around the edge.

Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl whisk the remaining 3/4 cup of cold milk
into the cornstarch. Whisk in the egg yolks. Slowly stir in 1/2 cup
of the hot cream mixture, then slowly stir this mixture into the
remaining hot cream. Cook, continuing to stir, about 1/2 a minute
more until the mixture forms soft shapes when dropped from a spoon.
Remove the custard from the heat, and stir in the vanilla. Transfer
to a medium-size bowl, and stir occasionally to allow steam to
escape. Stir in all but 1/4 cup of the coconut. Cover the surface
with wax paper or plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and
cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
F. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Slowly
beat in the sugar and cream of tartar and continue to beat until the
meringue is shiny and holds stiff peaks.

Spoon the cooled custard into the prebaked pie shell and spread the
meringue over the pie, covering the entire surface. Sprinkle with the
remaining coconut. Bake on the center rack of the oven until the
peaks are golden, about 10 minutes. Let cool and refrigerate for 1
hour before serving.

Serves 8 to 10
