This recipe comes from Colombia in South America. Rabbit meat is very
low in fat and can be dry tasting, so it marries well with coconut
cream. It is best to cook the rabbit gently till it is falling off
the bone.

Chop a rabbit into serving pieces.  Chop finely one large onion and 2
cloves of garlic.  Seed and slice a large green capsicum, half a
large red capsicum and finely slice 3 birdseye chillies (decrease the
quantity and discard the seeds if you can't cope with too much chilli
heat). Peel and chop a large tomato and have ready 400 ml strong veal
or chicken stock and
150 ml coconut cream.

Heat a little oil in a frying pan and brown the rabbit pieces.
Transfer them to a large saucepan.  In the remaining oil in the
frying pan, saute the onions, capsicums and chillies. Add to the
saucepan with the tomato, salt and pepper to taste, and the stock.
Bring just to simmering point, cover and cook very gently for about 2
hours or even more. Lift the rabbit pieces out onto a dish and turn
the heat up high under the saucepan. Reduce the liquid in the
saucepan by about half.

Lower the heat and stir in the coconut cream.  Return the rabbit
pieces and cook gently, stirring, for a few minutes. Serve with rice.

(Serves 4)
