MARK'S NOTE:  An easy way to grill corn.  Soak the unhusked corn in
water for 20 minutes.  If using a grill, place the ears in the coals
right at the edge of your barbecue. Turn very often. They should be
done after 20 minutes, maybe a little less.  Or, bake in a 350F oven
for the same length of time.  This is my favourite way to cook corn,
it doesn't taste waterlogged using this method.
