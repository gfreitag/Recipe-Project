~------------- ~-- TO MAKE THE CAKE: In a large mixing bowl, combine
the cake mix, baking soda and eggs. Measure the Coca-Cola, stir
briskly until the foaming stops; add to the batter.  Blend
ingredients just until moistened, then beat at high speed of an
electric mixer for 3 minutes, scraping the bowl often. In a bowl,
combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice;add to the batter.
Add the chopped nuts to the batter and beat for 1 minute at medium
speed. Turn the batter into a well greased, lightly floured 9" X 13"
X 2" baking disk. Bake in a preheated 350Ã¸F oven for about 40 minutes
or until the cake tests done.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, remove
cake from pan and turn right side up on a rack to finish cooling. TO
MAKE SEA FOAM FROSTING: In the top of a double boiler, combine all of
the ingredients, except the vanilla extract. Beat for 1 minute at
high speed with an electric mixer. Place over boiling water (the
water should not touch the bottom of the top half of the double
boiler). Beat on high speed for about 7 minutes until the frosting
forms peaks when the mixer is raised. Remove from boiling water (for
the smoothest frosting, empty into a large bowl). Add the vanilla
extract and continue beating on high speed until thick enough to
spread, about 2 minutes.  Spread on the sides and top of the cold
banana cake.  From: "International Cooking with Coca-Cola", a give
