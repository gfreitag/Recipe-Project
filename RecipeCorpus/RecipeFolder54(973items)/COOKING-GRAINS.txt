Title: COOKING GRAINS
Categories: Grain veget, Info/tips
2    water
Yield: 4 Servings
1    grain

The easiest way to cook grains is to rinse first in a colander under
cold water until water runs clear. Then place in a fixed quantity of
water (2 parts water for 1 part grain), bring to a rapid boil and
lower heat to a simmer. Cover, simmer according to package directions
and don't be tempted to stir. (Stirring makes a mushy end product.)
This method is particularly well suited to softer grains, like
quinoa. To speed cooking of hard grains like barley and wheat
berries, soak several hours in cold water to cover. Then cook in a
large open pot of boiling water, (see package directions). Then check
out our recipes for some great grain-and-veggie combinations.
