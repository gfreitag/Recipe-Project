Title: COKE BARBEQUE SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Coke
1    Bottle ketchup
Coke has uses in barbeque besides just tenderizing meat. For a quick
sauce, pour a can of Coke Classic in a sauce pan, add a bottle of
catsup, stir well and cook it down to sauce consistency. That's it! I
know of a popular restaurant that uses this as its house sauce!!!!!!
