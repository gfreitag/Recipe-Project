Title: COFFEE CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 45 Servings
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Oat flour
1/4 c  Sugar
4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/3 c  Strong brewed coffee,
Cooled
"The pronounced flavor of freshly brewed coffee makes these crackers
an extraordinary treat. They are versatile enough for a champagne
brunch or a light dessert after a satisfying meal. 325~F. 12 to 18
minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Mix the flours and sugar together in a large bowl or in the food
processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Add the coffee and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On
a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a
sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut into 2-inch shapes.

Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
sheet. Prick each one all the way through in 2 or 3 places with the
tines of a fork. Bake for 12 to 18 minutes, or until the crackers are
medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 40-45.

VARIATIONS: If you like your coffee a little sweeter, lightly and
evenly sprinkle the rolled dough with sugar and roll over it lightly
with your rolling pin before cutting. For crunchiness, add 1/2 cup
cracked wheat with the flour.

Add 1 Tablespoon grated lemon zest to the flour. To prepare the zest,
lightly grate the skin of a medium-sized lemon against the fine grate
of a cheese grater. Use only the colored part. The underlying white
portion is bitter.
