Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Freshly grated coconut*

In a large bowl, combine the coconut and sugar.  In another bowl,
combine the eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, raisins, and butter. Stir
this mixture into the grated coconut. Sift in the flour, baking
powder, and salt. Combine, mixing until smooth.  Pour the batter into
2 greased 9-inch loaf pans, and bake in a preheated 350 deg. F. oven
for 1 hour, or until a tester comes out clean.  Set the pans on wire
racks to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the breads from the pans and
continue cooling on the wire racks. Yield: 2 loaves * Store bought
grated coconut will not give this bread the moistness that freshly
grated coconut will.
