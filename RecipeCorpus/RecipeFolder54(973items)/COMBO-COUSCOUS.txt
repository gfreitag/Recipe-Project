Procedure

1) In a large pot, put 5 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of oil, meat,
onion, tomato, cinnamon, pepper, and parsley. Bring to a boil and
then simmer for
45    minutes.

2) Meanwhile, place the couscous in a large bowl and sprinkle with 2
tablespoons of oil. Mix with 2 cups of water, and then rub the mixture
between the palms of your hands to separate the grains. Let stand for
30 minutes or longer.

3) Add the cabbage and zucchini to the large pot. Bring to low boil
for 10 minutes.

4) Put the couscous in a sieve. Make a well in the centre of the
mixture so that the steam will circulate while cooking.

5) Put the turnip, carrots, and potatoes in the large pot. Then place
the sieve in the top of the pot, above the cooking liquid. Place a
cloth over the top of the pot and secure it with the lid. Steam over
low heat for 30 minutes.

6) Place the couscous back in the large bowl. Mix in 1/4 cup of soup
liquid to slightly moisten. Then mound the couscous on a platter and
sprinkle with the raisons. Serve with the soup.

Variations:  Use different vegetables. Place the cooked meat and
vegetables on top of the couscous to serve. Sprinkle 1 cup of cooked
chick peas on the couscous.
