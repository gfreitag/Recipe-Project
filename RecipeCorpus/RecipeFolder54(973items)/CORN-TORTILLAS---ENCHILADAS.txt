Title: CORN TORTILLAS - ENCHILADAS
Categories: Mexican, Tortilla
Yield: 1 Servings
c  Quaker Oats Masa Harina mix
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1 ts Salt
Add salt to dry Masa Harina. (Quaker Oats Masa Harina mix (corn and
lime), is available in many supermarkets.) Mix masa with 1 1/3 to 1
1/2 C warm water. Mix in well and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Form
into golf ball sized balls.

Heat up a cast iron griddle over low-med heat, ungreased.

Put each ball of Masa between two pieces of wax paper and press down
flat with a flat-bottomed pan or bowl (or tortilla press if you want
to spend the money). You won't get it as thin as store bought
tortillas, but you want them a little thick. They taste better that
way! Pull off the wax paper off one side. Flip tortilla onto the
curled fingers of your other hand (so that remaining wax paper is now
face up), then very carefully peel off other wax paper. This might
take some practice. If one corner doesn't work, start at the other.
(If dough repeatedly sticks, you've used too much water. If dough
repeatedly falls apart, you haven't used enough water.)

Cook each tortilla on the griddle, first on one side , then the other.
Don't let them get crispy.

To make Enchiladas:

The above, plus some finely chopped onion, some grated cheese (Use
Monterey Jack)

Most recipes say you first fry the tortillas for a few seconds in hot
oil then drain before going on to the next step. You can skip this
step without much loss in flavor if you use home-made tortillas.
Experiment. Dip a tortilla in enchilada sauce. Put it down in a
lasagna pan. Sprinkle grated cheese and onion on it. Put another
tortilla that has been dipped in sauce over the top and repeat to two
or three layers thick.

At the end pour remaining sauce over top with remaining cheese and
onions.

Bake at 350 degrees for about twenty minutes.
