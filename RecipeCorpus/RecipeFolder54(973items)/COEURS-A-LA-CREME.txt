Title: COEURS A LA CREME
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Unsalted cream cheese
10 oz Soured cream
2 tb Caster sugar
2 lg Egg whites
MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
Fruit of your choice, such
-as raspberries and
-redcurrants
4 tb Double cream
Quite simply combine the cream cheese, soured cream and sugar
thoroughly in a mixing bowl. Then whisk the egg whites until they are
stiff and fold them carefully into the cream mixture. The whole lot
now needs to be drained - overnight - in a cool place, and this is
done by placing the mixture in a suitably-sized square of muslin, and
placing this in a sieve over a bowl. When it has drained completely,
pile the mixture into small dishes or ramekins, arrange your fruit on
top, then pour a tablespoon of cream over each serving.
