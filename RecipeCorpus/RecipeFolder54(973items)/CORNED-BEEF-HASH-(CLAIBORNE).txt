From "The New York Times Cook Book," Craig Claiborne. Harper and Row,
1990.

Put the corned beef in a kettle and add water to cover to a depth of
about 2". Bring to a boil and let simmer uncovered 1 hour. Cover
closely and continue cooking 3 hours.

Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a saucepan and add cold water to cover
and salt. Cook until almost tender but relatively firm, 20-30
minutes. The potatoes must not be overcooked or they will not cube
properly. Drain and let cool. Peel the potatoes and cut them into
very small dice. There should be about 3 1/2 cups. When the corned
beef is cooked, remove and let cool. Heat the butter in a skillet and
add the onions and green pepper. Cook, stirring, until wilted.

Trim away and discard the fat from the corned beef. Cut the corned
beef into very thin slices and cut the slices into very small cubes.
There should be about 5 cups. Put the cubed meat into a mixing bowl
and add the potatoes and onion mixture. Add the egg and egg yolk,
Worcestershire, salt and pepper and blend thoroughly with the
fingers. Press down with the fingers to make the mass compact. Cover
with clear plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Shape the mixture into 8 portions of more or less equal size. (Or, if
you prefer, heat butter or oil in a nonstick skillet and cover the
bottom with hash.) Flatten each portion into patties. Heat 1 teaspoon
of butter or oil for each patty to be cooked. Cook 2 or 3 minutes on
one side, or until brown. Turn the patty and cook 2 or 3 minutes on
the other side, or until brown. Serve if desired, with a poached egg
atop each patty.
