Title: COLCANNON #1
Categories: Irish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Curly kale or cabbage,
-cooked
1 lb Potatoes, cooked
1    Onion, chopped
1 oz Dripping per lb. vegetables
Salt and pepper
Milk if necessary
1    Ring, wrapped in greaseproof
-paper
Mash the potatoes or pass them through a food mill. Chop the cabbage
or kale and add it to the potatoes. Mix well. Peel and chop the
onion. Melt a little of the dripping in a large, heavy frying pan and
cook the onion in it.  Remove and mix with the potato and cabbage.
Season to taste, and stir in a little milk if the mixture is too
stiff. Add the rest of the dripping to the hot pan and, when very
hot, turn the potato and cabbage mixture into the pan and spread it
out. Fry until brown, then cut it roughly and continue frying until
there are lots of crisp brown pieces. Just before serving, slip in
the wrapped ring ~- the trick, as you can see from the rhyme, is to
make sure the ring doesn't turn up too soon -- then the children will
eat it all willingly!
