Title: CORN & POTATO CHOWDER
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Coarsely chopped onions
(preferably red)
4 c  Boiling veg. stock (or
More)
1 lb Thin-skinned potatoes,
Peeled and cut into 1/2"
Dice
1 lg Red bell pepper, seeded and
Diced
4 c  Fresh or frozen (defrosted)
Corn kernels
2 ts Fresh or 1/2 t dried thyme
Heat some stock in the cooker.  Cook the onions over medium-high heat,
stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the rest of the stock,
potatoes, red bell pepper, 1 C of corn, and thyme. (She notes here
that if you are using fresh corn, add the cobs too for more
sweetness.)

Lock the lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Lower
the heat just enough to maintain high pressure ad cook for 4 minutes.
(!!! I was impressed !!!) Reduce the pressure with a quick-release
method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess
steam to escape.

Remove the corn cobs (if used).  With a slotted spoon, put about 2 C
cooked veggies into a food processor and puree them w/2 more C of the
corn. (I just dumped the 2C corn into the cooker and used one of
those hand-held blenders right in there to puree things together
until it looked nice.) Stir the puree back into the soup together
with the remaining C of uncooked corn.  Add salt and pepper and
simmer until the just-added corn is tender, 2-3 minutes.
