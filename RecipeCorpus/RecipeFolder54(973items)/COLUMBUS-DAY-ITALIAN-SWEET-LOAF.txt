Title: COLUMBUS DAY ITALIAN SWEET LOAF
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
2 pk Dry yeast
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Melted butter
2    Whole eggs plus 3 egg yolks
1 ts Salt
4 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
1    Egg yolk combined with: 2
-tsp flour
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Water
Dissolve the yeast and brown sugar in warm water in a large mixing
bowl.

Set aside for about 10 minutes or until the yeast has become foamy.
Stir in the butter, eggs, additional yolks and salt. Blend well. Add
the flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing well. Turn the dough out onto a
floured board and knead with additional four for about 5 minutes or
until the dough is elastic and not sticky. Divided the dough in half.
Flatten and shape each half into a round loaf.  Place on a greased
baking sheet, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rise in a
warm,draft free place until the loaves are doubled in bulk, about 1-2
hours. Brush the egg mixture on the top of the loaves and slash twice
with a sharp knife. Sprinkle with additional sugar and bake in a
preheated 325 F oven for 35-40 minutes.

Cool on a wire rack before slicing. Makes 2 loaves.
