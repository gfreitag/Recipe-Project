MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
1 pk Coconut, sweetened
-(large)
1 x  Almond paste, broken
-into chunks
1 tb Vanilla extract
Salt
6 lg Egg whites
PREPARE ALMOND PASTE:  Process almonds in food processer until finely
chopped, almost almond butter. Add confectioners' sugar and process
till smooth.  Add egg whites.

Mixture should become very stiff and form a ball in the machine. If
you cannot get it to become evenly moistened, take the mixture out
and knead it on a board "floured" with confectioners' sugar. Divide
the well-blended paste into three equal batches.  (Can wrap well at
this point to refrigerate, up to a week.)

MAKE MACAROONS:  Make this recipe in a food processor in three
batches. For each batch use 1/2 Cup each granulated and
confectioner's sugar, 1/3 of the coconut and almond paste, 1/8 t
salt, 1 t vanilla and
2    egg whites.

In processor bowl, combine granulated sugar and coconut. Process
about 2 minutes or until the coconut is finely ground. Add the
confectioners' sugar and the almond paste. Process until the mixture
resembles cornmeal. With the machine running, add the salt, vanilla
and egg whites. Process until the mixture is evenly moistened.

Drop mixture by teaspoonsful onto a cookie sheet covered with brown
paper. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 15-20 minutes, or until the
macaroons are lightly browned. Remove from oven and place brown paper
on a damp towel. When cookies are slightly cooled, use a spatula to
remove them; place them in an air-tight container so they will remain
chewy. Makes 3 to 4 dozen small cookies or 18 large ones.
