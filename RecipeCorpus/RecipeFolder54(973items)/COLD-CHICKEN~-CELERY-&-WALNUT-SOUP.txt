Title: COLD CHICKEN~ CELERY & WALNUT SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Chicken legs
2    Onions, peeled
1    Carrot, peeled
6    Black peppercorns
1 1/2 l  Water ( 2 1/2 pints)
2    Heads celery, washed
3 tb Olive oil
5    Cloves garlic, peeled
200 g  Shelled walnuts (7 oz)
2 tb Yoghurt
Sea salt
Black pepper, freshly ground
Remove ALL skin and fat from the chicken legs, place them in a
saucepan with one of the onions, the carrot, the peppercorns and a
large pinch of sea salt, cover with the water, bring to the boil and
simmer for 40-45 minutes.

Halfway through this time, chop up the remaining onion and the celery
and put them to soften in the olive oil in a heavy, covered pan. When
they are soft and the chicken is cooked through, strain nearly all
the stock from round the chicken over the onion and celery and
continue simmering for another 15-20 minutes.

Strip the chicken meat from the bones and cover it with one spoonful
or so of stock to keep it moist. Discard the bones and the carrot and
the whole onion from the stock.

In a large mortar crush the garlic with a little sea salt. Pound the
walnuts into this until they are quite fine (*). Then pound in the
chicken meat, which should be quite soft. Bind this mixture with the
yoghurt, season it with pepper, liquidize the celery soup and stir
the chicken and nut mixture in.

Chill before eating (**).

(*) You can crush the walnuts in an electric blender first; but do
not add the garlic, as the blender would have a brutalizing effect on
its taste.

(**) This soup is best eaten cold, but is also good warm !
