Title: COCONUT JOYS
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 3 Dozen
1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)
3 c  Coconut
-(one standard package)
2 c  Powdered sugar
2 oz Chocolate (unsweetened),
-melted (2 squares)
Melt butter in a sauce pan.  Remove from heat.  Add powdered sugar and
coconut.  Mix well.

Shape rounded teaspoons of mixture into balls.  Make an indent in
center of each and place on cookie sheet. Fill centers with melted
chocolate. Chill until firm. Store in refrigerator.

NOTES:

*  Super-sweet, super-rich holiday cookies -- This is an easy recipe
that can knock your socks off for flavor and sweetness. In other
words, it will make your teeth fall out.

*  We use sweetened coconut and also use semi-sweet chocolate. This
is why they make your teeth fall out.

*  I tried an approach of melting the stick of margarine using the
microwave on full for 48 seconds. While it was melting, I measured and
mixed up the dry ingredients. I then poured half the liquid over the
premixed coconut-sugar mixture; mixed some and poured in the
remainder. This worked well for me, but my wife insists that the
listed method is easier.

*  Your clean thumb is the best way to make the indentations.

*  Be sure to keep them in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
