Title: COOL GHOUL TREATS
Categories: Gifts, Holidays, Kids
Yield: 1 Servings
Clear plastic or latex
-gloves
Twist ties
Scissors
Flavored drink mix, regular
-or sugar-free
Gummy worms (optional)
If the gloves have a powdery residue inside them, turn them inside
out and soak in warm water or wipe with soapy water and rinse. Allow
gloves to dry. Or, turn gloves inside out, leaving the powdery side
on the outside.

Mix your favorite fruit drink (sugar-free liquid freezes better than
liquids with sugar) and pour into the gloves. Add enough drink to
fill the gloves loosely but not so full that the fingers will not
move. Fasten the gloves with the twist ties. Place paper towels on a
cookie sheet and lay the hands on the paper towels. Freeze. When the
hands are frozen sol- id, carefully cut off gloves with scissors.
Float hands in a bowl of punch for scary fun. If you wish, you may
add gummy worms to the juice before freezing.
