Categories: Chicken, Picnic, Broiler
1/2 c  soy sauce
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  sherry
1 TB paprika
2    garlic cloves
6    chickens -- split in half
1/2 c  cooking oil

^^ Marinate 60 mins. Combine the soy sauce, sherry, paprika, garlic,
and hot pepper sauce, and pour over the chicken halves. Let stand for
an hour or two, turning occasionally. ^^ Broiler 35-40 mins. Remove
the chicken from the marinade and brush each piece with oil. Broil,
bone side to the heat, for 13 mins. Brush with the marinade and broil
for 3 more minutes. Turn, and move the chicken a little farther from
the broiling unit to prevent the skin side from blistering and
burning. Brush skin side with marinade and broil for 12 minutes.
Brush again, and continue broiling until tender. Cool the chicken and
wrap in aluminum foil for carrying to the picnic site.
