Title: COLCANNON 2
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
6 lg Potatoes (pref red)
1 md Head of cabbage
1 lg Leek
3    Pieces of fresh garlic
Salt and pepper
A wee bit o' oil
Butter (or marg) to taste
Cheddar cheese (optional)
Cut up the potatoes and put them in a pot, cover with water, and boil
until tender. You may choose to peel them or not. I left the skin on
and it was fine.

While the potatoes are cooking, thinly slice the cabbage (as if you
were making sauerkraut). Trim the leek(s) and slice thinly. Peel the
garlic, chop fine, and saute in a little oil until translucent, then
add cabbage and leeks (you will need a good-sized skillet or frying
pan. I used a wok). Saute vegetables until tender and almost
transparent, but not too flabby. Set aside.

When the potatoes are done, drain them and give 'em a good shake. Mash
potatoes well, adding salt and pepper and butter to taste. Then mix
cabbage and leeks into potatoes and stir well. It should turn a pale
green color.

There are several things you could do after this point. You could just
serve it up right away, or you could put it into a baking pan,
drizzle some melted butter or margarine on top, and put it in the
oven to brown on top. Or you could put it into a baking dish, top
with grated cheddar cheese, and put into the oven until cheese is
bubbly. The third method is my personal favorite.

Note: using instant mashed potatoes totally takes away from the
flavor and texture of the dish, besides being inauthentic...but then
again, how authentic is it to prepare a Celtic recipe using a wok?
