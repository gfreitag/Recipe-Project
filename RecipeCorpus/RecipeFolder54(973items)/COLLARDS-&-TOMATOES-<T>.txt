Categories: Vegetarian, Low-fat
Yield: 2 Servings
15    Collard greens; torn into bi
; pieces, rinsed
1 tb Italian seasoning
10 oz Tomatoes, canned; chopped, r
; liquid
Recipe by: adaption by Reggie Dwork  reggie@netcom.com I took another
poster's recipe Kale and Tomatoes (sorry I forgot who posted it) and
changed the kale to collards. It is excellent.

Rinse torn leaves and do not shake or dry them.  Put in pot/pan and
wilt. Add Italian seasoning, chopped tomatoes and continue to heat
about 5 min. Add as much of the liquid as you want (a lot makes it
into a soup, a little bit makes it into a side dish).  Heat about 2 ~
3 more min or until hot and serve.

This serves 1 person.
