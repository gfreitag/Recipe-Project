Title: CONFETTI SALAD
Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Apples
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Cider
1/2 ts Salt
3    Granny Smith apples
2 c  Carrots; finely shredded
1    Sweet red pepper; fine chop
1 tb Scallion greens; minced
Sugar; to taste (opt)
Combine lemon juice, cider and salt in a non-reactive bowl.Peel an
apple and grate it into the bowl,using the graters large holes so you
get shreds rather than pulp.Discard core.Stir to coat shreds with the
dressing so they don't brown,then repeat with the remaining apples..
Toss the carrots,red pepper and chives.The salad tends to clump,so a
large fork works better than a spoon.Let it sit for 10 minutes or so
to develop flavor,then add sugar to taste.The amount needed will not
be constant,since carrots and apples both vary greatly in
sweetness.Makes 6 to 8 servings..
