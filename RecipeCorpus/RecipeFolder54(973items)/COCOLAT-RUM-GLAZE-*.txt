Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM----------------------PATTI - VDRJ67A---------------------------
4 oz Bittersweet Chocolate
6 tb Butter
1 tb Light corn syrup
1 tb Dark rum (optional)
In heavy saucepan on low heat, melt broken chocolate with butter,
stirring constantly until smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in corn
syrup and rum. Place torte upside down on a rack over tray to catch
excess glaze. Spread a very thin layer of glaze over top and sides of
torte to set surface. Chill 15 minutes to firm glaze. Reheat
remaining glaze to thin and pour over top and sides of torte. When
glaze is firm, remove cake from rack to large plate. Decorate top and
sides with shaved chocolate, if desired. For shiny glaze, store cake
at room temperature until serving time.
