Combine the seasoning mix together in a bowl.  Stir the dipping sauce
ingredients together in a second bowl. Have this ready at the table
when the shrimp are done.

Mix together about 2 t of the seasoning mix, about 1 1/4 cups of
flour, the beer and the baking powder, and place this in a third bowl.

Combine the remaining flour with another 2 t of the seasoning mix.

Coat each shrimp with the remaining seasoning mix, then in the flour
mixture, then in the batter, then in the coconut. Deep-fry the shrimp
for about 1 minute and drain on paper towels.

NOTES:

*  Shrimp in coconut beer batter with dipping sauce -- Adapted from
Chef Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen." A nice appetizer, though
very caloric.

*  Don't put too much batter on or it will overwhelm the poor shrimp.
The dipping sauce is great for other things as well.

: Difficulty:  easy if you can deep-fry.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  Measure batter, improvise with spices and dipping sauce.
