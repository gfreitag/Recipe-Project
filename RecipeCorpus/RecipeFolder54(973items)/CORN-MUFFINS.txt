Yield: 2 Servings
1/3 c  Unbleached Flour
1/3 c  Yellow Cornmeal
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 ea Large Beaten Egg
1/4 c  Milk
4 ts Cooking Oil
1 x  Yellow Corn Meal
In a small bowl sift together flour, 1/3 c of yellow cornmeal, sugar,
baking powder, and salt.  Make a well in the center of the dry
ingredients. Stir together beaten egg, milk and cooking oil. Add all
at once to the dry ingredients, stirring just till moistened. Line

Sprinkle a little additional cornmeal atop muffins.  Micro-cook,

rearranging twice. (When done, the surface may appear moist but a
wooden pick inserted near the center should come out clean.)
