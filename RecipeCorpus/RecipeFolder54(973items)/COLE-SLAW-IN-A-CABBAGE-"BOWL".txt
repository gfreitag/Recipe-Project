The author suggests serving this salad at a picnic.

To make the cabbage "bowl," use a sharp knife and cut a lid one
quarter of the way from the top (not stem) end of the red cabbage.
Using a grapefruit knife, cut out most of the interior cabbage from
the lid, leaving a shell 1/4" thick.  Set aside.  Remove inner
cabbage from "bowl," leaving a sturdy 1/4" shell.  With a sharp
knife, trim off stem end so shell sits firmly. Shred cut red cabbage,
discarding any tough leaves or pieces.

In a large mixing bowl, toss together carrots, onions and shredded
red and green cabbage.

To make the vinaigrette, whisk together vinegar with the mustard and
salt. Slowly add oil by drops until smooth and thickened. Add caraway
seeds and chopped herbs. Taste and add sugar and/or lemon juice and
pepper.

Toss cabbage mixture with vinaigrette.  Cover and chill cole slaw,
overnight if desired.  To serve, fill cabbage bowl with slaw, top
with lid (and press firmly, securing with foil if transporting to a
picnic site.)

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
