Categories: Cyberealm, Kooknet, Mexican, Main dish
Yield: 12 Chiles
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE CHILES----------------------------
12    Poblano Chiles
8 oz Grated cheddar cheese
8 oz Monterey jack cheese, grated
1/2 c  Whole kernel corn
2 ts Dried basil
1 ts Dried oregano
Pepper
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE BATTER----------------------------
6 lg Eggs, separated
2 tb Flour
2 tb Baking powder
1 pn Salt
Flour
Red chile sauce
Fresh Cilantro sprigs
Corn oil
1. Preheat the broiler.

2. Arrange the Poblano chiles in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Broil until charred on all sides. Wrap in a plastic bag and cool.

3. Peel the skins from the chiles, and carefully make a slit in one
side of each chile. Remove and discard the seeds, rinse the chiles,
and pat dry.

4. Combine the two cheeses, corn, basil and oregano in a medium bowl.
Season this filling with pepper. Gently stuff each chile with 2-3
tablespoons of the filling, depending on the size of the chile.

5. Pour corn oil to a depth of 1" in a very large, heavy saucepan or
deep skillet. Heat the oven to 350F.

6. Beat the egg yolks in a medium sized bowl until slightly
thickened. Use clean, dry beaters to beat the egg whites in a large
bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold the egg yolks along with the
flour, baking soda, and salt into tht egg whites. Place additional
flour in a flat dish.

7. Roll each chile in flour to coat. Working in batches, dip each
chile into the batter. Fry until golden brown (about 2 minutes per
side.)

8. Transfer to paper towels using a slotted spoon. Place 1/4 cup of
the red chile sauce on each serving plate, and top the sauce with 2
chiles rellenos. Garnish with cilantro sprigs. Serve hot!
