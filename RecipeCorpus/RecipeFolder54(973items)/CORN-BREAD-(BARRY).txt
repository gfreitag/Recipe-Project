Title: CORN BREAD (BARRY)
Categories: Barry, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
14 oz Strong Plain Flour
10 oz Medium Yellow Corn Meal
-Not Corn Flour
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Baking Powder
8 fl Milk
4 tb Sunflower or Soya Oil
2 tb Natural Yoghurt
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
8 oz Grated Cheddar Cheese
Grease a 2 pound loaf tin and heat the oven to gas mark 5,375F,190C.
Place the flour, corn meal, sugar and baking powder into a bowl, and
beat in the eggs, milk, oil and yoghurt. Mix all the liquids together
first if you like, then pour them in. Give the mixture a good stir.
At this point you could add 8 ounces of grated Cheddar Cheese or
similar. Pour into the tin and bake for 55 minutes. Test with a
skewer - if it comes out clean it's ready, if it's a bit smeary it
needs another 5 to 10 minutes, but cover the top with foil to stop
the crust burning. Remove when ready and let it stand for five
minutes before turning out. You may find a knife round the edge helps
