Title: COQUILLES SAINT-JACQUES SAUTEES A LA PROVENCA
Categories: Italian, Shellfish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Or about 2 c. scallops
Cut into 1/2 inch pieces
Lemon juice, salt, and
Pepper
1/2 c  Flour
Olive oil or cooking oil
A 10 inch frying pan
(preferably a no-stick
Pan)
2 tb Minced shallots or
Scallions
1    Clove garlic, mashed
2 tb Butter
2 tb Minced fresh parsley
Dry the scallops in paper towels, then place on a large sheet of waxed
paper.  Sprinkle with drops of lemon juice, then with salt and
pepper. The moment before sauteing, dredge with flour and shake in a
sieve to dislodge excess flour. Film the frying pan with a 1/16-inch
layer of oil. When almost smoking, add the scallops. Toss for 4 to 5
minutes until scallops are lightly browned.  Then toss for a moment
with the shallots or scallions, and garlic; finally toss with the
butter and parsley and serve. Suggested accompaniments: If the
scallops are a first course, accompany with French bread. For a main
course, accompany with broiled tomatoes and green beans. Notes:
Sauteed scallops should be crisp light brown outside and moistly
tender inside. Keys to success are: have your sauteing oil very hot
before the scallops go in, and have no more than one layer of
scallops in the pan.  Otherwise the scallops will steam, exude
moisture, and will not brown. You may find, in using frozen scallops,
that they will start out nicely, then suddenly release juices in the
pan; to avoid this, blanch them before cooking by dropping them in a
large pan of rapidly boiling water and bringing them quickly back to
the boil, then drain immediately, dry them, and proceed with the
recipe.
