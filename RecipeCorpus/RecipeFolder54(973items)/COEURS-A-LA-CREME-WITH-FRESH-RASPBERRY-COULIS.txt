Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
8 oz Curd or cottage cheese
-OR- Cream cheese
10 fl Double (heavy) cream
2 tb Caster (superfine) sugar
2    Egg whites
5 fl Single (light) cream
8 oz Raspberries
MMMMM----------------------RASPBERRY COULIS---------------------------
10 oz Fresh raspberries
1/2 c  Caster (superfine) sugar
2 tb Lemon juice
Traditionally the heart-shaped moulds were made of wicker; now china
ones are used.  If you decide to use cream cheese, make sure it is
unsalted.

Press the cheese through a fine sieve into a mixing bowl and stir in
first the double cream then the sugar. Beat until light and fluffy.
In a small bowl, beat the egg whites just until stiff. Fold them
carefully into the cheese mixture.

Line six moulds with fine damp muslin or cheesecloth. Spoon the
cheese into the prepared moulds, tapping the sides gently to allow
the mixture to settle.  Fold the ends of the cloth over the moulds,
place them on a cake rack and refrigerate overnight.

To make coulis, liquidize the raspberries and sugar to a smooth
puree. Add lemon juice to taste.  Pass through a sieve into a small
bowl. To serve, spoon a little of the raspberry coulis on to each
serving plate. Discard any draining liquid and unmould the
heart-shaped desserts on top of the sauce.  Drizzle with cream and
surround with the raspberries.
