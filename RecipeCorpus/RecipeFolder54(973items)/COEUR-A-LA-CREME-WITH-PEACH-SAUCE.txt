Combine 1 cup whipping cream and sour cream in a small bowl; stir
well. Cover and let stand at room temperature 6 to 8 hours or until
slightly thickened. (If desired, mixture may be chilled overnight
after it has thickened before completing recipe. Let mixture return
almost to room temperature before proceeding.) Combine cottage
cheese, cream cheese and powdered sugar; beat at medium speed of an
electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add thickened cream mixture,
beating until smooth. Fold in whipped cream. Line a 4-cup coeur a la
creme mold with cheesecloth, letting cloth hang over edges of mold.
Spoon cheese mixture into prepared mold. Fold cheesecloth over top of
cheese mixture; place in a shallow dish, and chill overnight. Prepare
peach sauce immediately before serving. Place all ingredients in
container of blender; process until smooth. (Yield: 1 3/4 cups) To
serve, unfold cheesecloth, and unmold onto a serving plate with a
rim. Remove cheesecloth. Spoon Peach Sauce around base of mold. If
desired, garnish with fresh peach slices and lemon balm sprigs.
