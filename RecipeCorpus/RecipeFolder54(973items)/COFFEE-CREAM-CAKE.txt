5    Eggs; room temperature
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Instant coffee powder
3 tb Water; boiling
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  All purpose flour; sifted
1 ts Baking powder
2 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Coffee; very strong cold
2 tb Coffee liqueur
Walnut; chopped, toasted
Chocolate coffee beans
Preheat oven to 350~. Separate eggs. Combine egg yolks and 1 cup
sugar in large bowl and beat until thick and lemon colored, about 5
minutes. Dissolve coffee powder in boiling water. Blend in vanilla
and dissolved coffee powder. Combine flour and baking powder and
blend into batter. Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold into batter.
Turn into ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake 30 minutes. Invert onto
rack and let stand until completely cool. For frosting: Whip cream
with 2 tablespoons sugar until soft peaks form. Add coffee and
liqueur and beat until stiff. Slice cake crosswise into thirds. Use
about 1/3 of cream frosting to fill layers and remainder to frost
entire cake (save some frosting and pipe rosettes over top for
garnish, if desired). Chill until whipped cream is slightly firm.
Press nuts onto sides of cake and arrange coffee beans atop rosettes,
if desired. Chill 4 hours before serving.
