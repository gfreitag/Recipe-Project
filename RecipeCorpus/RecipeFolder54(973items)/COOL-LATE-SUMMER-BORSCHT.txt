the beets. Place beets in a heavy pot. Add the apple juice, water,
lemon juice and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and
cook soup for 15 minutes, partially covered, skimming foam that rises
to top. Remove from heat and cool to room temp. Place 2 cups yogurt
in a bowl and whisk in about 3 cups of the soup. Gradually whisk this

with a dollop of yogurt, then sprinkle with the diced radishes and
cucumbers. Per serving: 147 calories, .3g fat, and 1 mg cholesterol.
