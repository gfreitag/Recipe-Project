Any cream soup will do, although cream of mushroom is best.

Remove skin from chicken, bone, and cube into bite-size pieces. Bones
may be left in if desired. Skinless, boneless chicken breasts may be
used if dark meat is not desired.

Coat chicken pieces in flour. Brown coated pieces in oil in a large
frying pan. Remove browned chicken to a large casserole dish.

SautÂ‚ onion and garlic in same frying pan that was used for chicken.
Add soup and wine (note wine is used to dilute the condensed soup
instead of water). When well mixed add to the chicken casserole.

Add chopped parsley and mushrooms. Small button mushrooms would be
best for size.

Note: if sauce is too thick dilute with chicken stock or wine.

Place casserole in 350F oven for about 1 hour, or until chicken is
completely cooked.

Serve in puff pastry cups with rice, pasta or mashed potatoes.
