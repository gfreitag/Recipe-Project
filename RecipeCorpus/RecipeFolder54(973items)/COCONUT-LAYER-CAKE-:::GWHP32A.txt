2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Butter; or shortening

3    Eggs; unbeaten
1/3 c  Milk

Sift flour once, measure,add baking powder and salt, and sift together
three times.  Cream  butter thoroughly, add sugar gradually, and cream
together until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating
thoroughly after each.  Add  flour, alternately with milk, a small
amount at a time, beating after each addition until smooth. Add
vanilla. Bake in two greased 9-inch layer pans in moderate oven at
375degrees F.) 25 to 30 minutes. Spread Tinted Seven Minute Frosting
between layers and on top and sides of cake. Sprinkle top and sides
of cake with Baker's Southern Style Coconut. Use the recipe for
Coconut Layer Cake. Spread Fudge Frosting between layers and on top
and sides of cake. Decorate sides of cake with chopped pecans, if
desired.  Note: This recipe was taken from an old phamplet dated
1940, which featured Kate Smith's favorite Cakes. It was published by
General Mills, and the pampHlet is falling apart! I am glad to be
able to save these old recipes. For those who too young to remember,
where
it calls for the use of a rotary mixer in these recipes, just use
your electric mixer, or hand mixer as required.
