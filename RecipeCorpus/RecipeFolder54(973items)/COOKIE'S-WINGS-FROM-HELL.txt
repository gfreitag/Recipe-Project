Title: COOKIE'S WINGS FROM HELL
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Butter
4 c  Hot sauce
2 tb Cayenne
Chicken wings
To cut down the heat, use 1 Tb Ground Red pepper plus 1 Tb cayenne.
Heat sauce as needed, for 10 minutes at 350, then dip wings into hot
sauce mix. You can double the sauce recipe if you like. Use as much
as you need to coat wings. It will keep indefinitely.  Just shake the
jar and pour as much sauce as needed into a pan and reheat to dip
chicken wings. The chef who gave me the recipe makes it a gallon at a
time. He uses the cayenne-red pepper mix, I use all cayenne.
