Title: CORN FRITTERS (BARRY)
Categories: Barry
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Plain flour
1 sm Egg
8 fl Milk
6 oz Tin of sweetcorn, drained
Salt and Pepper
Blend the flour with the egg and the milk to make a smooth batter,
then leave to stand for 20 minutes.

Add the sweetcorn, season and stir. It should have the consistency of
double cream.

To cook, pour a tablespoon at a time into the pan with the hot oil in
which you have cooked the chicken. Turn the fritters after one or two
minutes so both sides are golden and speckled with brown. Add the
fritters to the dish with the chicken and bananas and serve with
gravy and plenty of mashed potatoes.
