Title: COCONUT ICE
Categories: Desserts, Ices, Vegetarian
Yield: 700 Grams
450 g  Granulated sugar
150 ml Water
1 ts Vanilla essence
100 g  Desiccated coconut
Red vegetable colouring
First line an 18 cm (7 inch) square tin with nonstick paper.

Put the granulated sugar and water into a medium-sized, heavy-based
saucepan and heat gently, without boiling, until the sugar has
dissolved.

Bring to the boil and let it simmer steadily until the temperature
reaches 120 C (240 F) on a sugar thermometer, or a little of the
syrup dropped into a cup of cold water forms a soft ball. Remove from
the heat immediately and add the vanilla essence and dessicated
coconut.

Stir the mixture for 5-10 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and
set, then pour half of it into the prepared tin and smooth it level.
Colour the remaining half pale pink with a drop or two of the
colouring, then pour this on top of the white coconut ice, spreading
it to the edges and making sure it's level. Press it all down quite
firmly with the back of a spoon, and leave it to harden.

Turn the coconut ice out and cut it into squares using a sharp knife.
