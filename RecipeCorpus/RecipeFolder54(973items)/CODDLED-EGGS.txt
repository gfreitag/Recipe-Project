Title: CODDLED EGGS
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
3 oz Baby Spinach Leaves, Trimmed
3    Tomatoes, Quartered
Salt and Pepper
4 ts Worcestershire Sauce
4    Eggs, Size 3
1/4 pt Soured Cream
2    Slices, Wholemeal Bread
1 oz Butter
1 tb Vegetable Oil
Parsley Sprigs to Garnish
Preheat the oven to Gas 4, 350F, 180C, 10 minutes before cooking the
eggs. Arrange the spinach in the base of four oven-proof ramekin
dishes. Add the tomatoes, then season well.

Add 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce to each ramekin, then carefully
break in an egg. Spoon the soured cream around each egg, then place
the ramekins in a shallow baking tin half filled with hot water.
Cover and cook in the oven for 35 minutes or until the eggs are set.

Meanwhile, cut each slice of bread into triangles. Melt the butter
and oil together in a frying pan, then fry the bread, turning once,
for 5 mins, or until crisp and golden.

Place the ramekins on a serving plate and arrange the fried bread
around the dishes. Garnish with the parsley sprigs and serve
immeadiately.
