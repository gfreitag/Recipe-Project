Categories: Soups, Low-fat/low
Yield: 4 Servings

1 c  Onion -- chopped
6 c  Corn kernels -- with any
Milk collec
Removed from the cob

Skimmed
1/2 c  Red bell pepper -- chopped
1/2 ts Fresh rosemary -- chopped

Preheat a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat for about 1 minute.
Spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Saute the onion for about 5
minutes, until translucent.  Add 4 cups of the corn and saute for 4

stock and cook until the corn can be mashed easily with a fork, about
20 minutes.

Transfer the contents of the pan to a blender and puree until smooth.
Return the puree to the saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the bell
pepper, rosemary, thyme, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and the
remaining 1 cup chicken stock and 2 cups corn. Stir and cook for
about 10 minutes more, until the chowder is thick and creamy.

Garnish with the chopped basil.
