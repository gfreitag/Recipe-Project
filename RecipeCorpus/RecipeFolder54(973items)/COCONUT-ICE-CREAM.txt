Title: COCONUT ICE CREAM
Categories: Desserts, Ice cream
Yield: 12 Servings
5 c  Grated fresh coconut *
1 c  Sugar
3 c  Milk
5    Egg yolks
1.  Put the grated coconut in a saucepan and add the sugar and milk.
Bring to the boil and cook about 5 minutes.  Let cool. 2. Strain
the liquid through a piece of cheesecloth and squeeze the
coconut meat to extract as much liquid as possible. Reserve 2
cups of the grated meat and discard the rest or put it to another
use. 3. Put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl and beat with a whisk.
Beat
in the sweetened liquid and scrape the mixture into a saucepan
and heat.  Use a wooden spoon and stir constantly, this way and
that, making certain that the spoon touches all over the bottom
of the saucepan.  Cook until the mixture has a custard-like
consistency and coats the sides of the spoon (180 degrees). Do
not let the sauce boil, or it will curdle.  This cooking will rid
the custard of the raw taste of the yolks. 4. Immediately remove
the sauce from the heat and continue stirring.
Set the saucepan in a basin of cold water to reduce the
temperature.  Let the sauce cool to room temperature. 5. Pour the
custard into the container of an electric or hand-
cranked ice cream maker.  Partly freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.  Add the reserved 2 cups of coconut
pulp and continue freezing until solid.

* GRATED FRESH COCONUT

Use 1 or 2 coconuts.  It is best to use 2 in case 1 isn't sweet
enough. Select large coconuts that are heavy and contain a lot of
liquid. You can determine the amount of liquid when you shake the
coconut.

Pierce the "eyes" of the coconut with an ice pick. Crack the shell of
the coconut in several places, using a hammer or hatchet.

Pry out the flesh with a blunt knife.  Pare away the dark skin. Grate
the coconut using the coarse blade of a grater or a food processor.
