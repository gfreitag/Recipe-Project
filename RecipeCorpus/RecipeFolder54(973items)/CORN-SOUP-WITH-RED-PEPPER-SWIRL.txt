Choose the freshest, darkest yellow corn to give this soup colour and
creamy texture. Bottled roasted red peppers also work well in the
sauce.

In saucepan, melt butter over medium heat; cook onions, garlic and
sage, covered and stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes or until
softened. Stir in corn; cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Remove 1 cup;
set aside.

Stir in flour to coat vegetables; cook for 1 minute. Pour in stock and
bring to boil, stirring frequently; reduce heat to low and simmer for
about 5 minutes or until thickened. In food processor or blender,
pure soup, in batches if necessary; returning to saucepan. Stir in
reserved corn mixture, milk and salt; heat through but do not boil.

Red Pepper Sauce: Meanwhile, in blender, pure red pepper, milk,
jalapeno, salt and pepper. Using spoon, attractively swirl about 2 tb
into each soup-bowlful.

Roasted Peppers: To roast sweet red peppers, grill or broil over
medium-high heat, turning often, until peppers are puffed and charred
all over. Or roast in 375F 190C oven for 30 minutes or until browned.
Let cool; peel and seed.
