Title: COOKIE ORNAMENTS FOR THE TREE
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 4 Servings
1 3/4 c  Hot Water
1 c  Salt
4 c  All-Purpose Flour
=== Egg Wash ==
1    Egg -- beaten with
3 tb Water
Pour the hot water into a bowl with the salt and stir for 1 minute (I
use my KitchenAid mixer).  The salt grains will reduce in size, but
they will not completely dissolve. Add the flour and blend until all
the water is absorbed. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and
knead a few minutes until it is smooth and pliable. Cover the dough
and allow to rest for 5 minutes.  Keep the dough in a plastic bag if
you do not plan to use it after the 5 minutes of resting time. Roll
the dough out 3/8" thick on a floured surface and cut out shapes with
cookie cutters. Place the cookies on a nonstick baking sheet and
brush lightly with the egg wash. Bake in a preheated 300 degree oven
for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until golden brown. You can also press
the dough into lightly oiled fancy ceramic molds* or lightly floured
wooden molds and bake as instruced by the manufacturer. *Decorative
ceramic cookie molds can be obtained from Brown Bag Cookie Art by
Hill Design, Inc. 7 Eagle Square, Concord, New Hampshire 03301 NOTES
: No, Virginia, you cannot EAT these cookies. The dough is made of
salt and flour and it will last for several years. This recipe makes
one dozen ornaments.  The Frugal Gourmet
