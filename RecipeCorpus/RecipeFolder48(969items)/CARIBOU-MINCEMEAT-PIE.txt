Categories: Game, Caribou, Pies, Jw
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Apple cider
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Dried currants
1 1/2 c  Apples; peeled and chopped
1/4 lb Ground caribou meat
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground allspice
1/4 c  Brandy or dark rum
1    Pastry recipe
In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, combine cider, raisins, and currants.
Cover and heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to low and
simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add apples, caribou,
cinnamon, cloves, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and allspice. Simmer 2 hours
longer. Add water as necessary to keep mincemeat from sticking to
saucepan. Cool mincemeat to room temperature, add the liquor and let
sit at least overnight before making pies.

Mincemeat can be kept in a cool place in a stone crock for 2 weeks,
canned or frozen. If frozen, thaw mincemeat before making pie.

Prepare pastry and refrigerate until ready to use-at least 30
minutes. Heat oven to 350'F. Divide pastry; roll out bottom crust and
roll out and cut strips for a top lattice. Carefully spoon mincemeat
into crust-lined pie plate. Place pastry strips one at a time across
mincemeat to create a woven grid. Lift edge of bottom crust over ends
of strips. Pinch together and flute edge. Bake pie 50 to 55 minutes
or until crust is lightly browned and filling bubbles. Cool 10
minutes on wire rack before cutting.

Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.
