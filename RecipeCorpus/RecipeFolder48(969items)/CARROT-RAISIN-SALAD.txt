Title: CARROT-RAISIN SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  GRATED CARROTS
1/2 c  SEEDLESS RAISINS
2 tb LEMON JUICE
1 tb SUGAR
1/4 c  MAYONAISE
1/2 c  NUTS, CHOPPED (PECANS OR
1 x  CASHEWS ARE GOOD CHOICES)
1/4 c  GRATED COCONUT
Grate carrot, being careful not to grate your finger, too! Toss
(that means mix together with a fork) the carrot, raisins, lemon
juice, and sugar.  Put in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Add the mayonaise and, if you like, the nuts and coconut. Toss
again to make sure the mayonaise coats all the carrot and serve.
To make it fancy, put each serving on a piece of lettuce.
