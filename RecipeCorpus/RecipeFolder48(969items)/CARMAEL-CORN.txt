Title: CARMAEL CORN
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
7 qt Popped popcorn
2 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Butter
Vanilla
1/2 c  Corn syrup
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Soda
Boil sugar, butter and corn syrup 4 minutes. Remove from stove and add
salt, soda and vanilla. (This will foam when soda is added). Pour over
popped popcorn, stir carefully. Put into a large pan into oven at
250F. for 1 hour. Carefully stir every 10 minutes. If pan is big
enough, shake popcorn--it doesn't crumble as much.
