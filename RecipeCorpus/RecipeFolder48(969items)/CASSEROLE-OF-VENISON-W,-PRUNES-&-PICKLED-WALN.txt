Categories: Scot/irish, Meats, Casseroles
Yield: 8 Servings
2 tb Flour; all-purpose (heaped)
1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper to taste
3 lb Venison; cut into 1-inch
.  cubes
4 tb Sunflower oil
3    Onions; finely sliced

The prunes and pickled walnuts provide just the sweet and sharp
contrast that complements the flavour of venison so well.

Put the flour, salt and a good grinding of pepper into a bowl. Toss
the pieces of venison in the seasoned flour to coat. Heat the oil in
a heavy flameproof casserole and brown the meat, a few pieces at a
time; remove the browned meat and keep it warm while you brown the
rest. When all the meat is browned, add the onions to the casserole
and cook them until they are soft and translucent, 5-10 minutes. Stir
in the wine and water, scraping the bits off the bottom of the
casserole with a wooden spoon. When the liquid is simmering. replace
the browned meat in the casserole, and stir in the pickled walnuts
and prunes.
Cover the casserole with a lid, and cook in a preheated moderate
oven (350øF / 180øC / gas 4) for an hour. Let the casserole cool
completely, then store in the refrigerator overnight. Cook it for a
further hour at the same temperature before serving. All stews and
casseroles benefit in flavour from reheating. "Lady MacDonald's
