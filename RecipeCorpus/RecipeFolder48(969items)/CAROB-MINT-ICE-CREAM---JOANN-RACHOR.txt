BANANA ICE CREAM INSTRUCTIONS:

Peel ripe, but not mushy bananas. Place in plastic bag and freeze
solid. This takes several hours. To make ice cream, cut 2 medium size
bananas into about 5 or 6 pieces. BLEND with 1/2-3/4 cup liquid, or
just enough to slowly turn bananas through the blades. The liquid may
be fruit juice such as pineapple, apple, orange or grape, or SOY OR
NUT MILK. While blending, use a rubber spatula to help bananas
rotate. Also, occasionally turn off machine and stir. Ice cream will
keep in the freezer up top 2 hours before getting hard to serve. Use
as a dessert or over WAFFLES, PANCAKES, GRANOLA, cooked cereal, etc.
