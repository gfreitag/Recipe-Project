Categories: Appetizers, Cheesecakes
Yield: 16 Servings
1 1/4 c  Gingersnap cookie crumbs
-(about 20 snaps)
1 c  Plus 2 tablespoons sugar,
-divided
1 ts Ground ginger
1/4 c  Unsalted butter or

-temperature (3 packages)
1 c  Shredded sharp Cheddar

5 lg Eggs, at room temperature
1/4 c  Non-alcoholic beer
1/4 c  Heavy cream
Preheat the oven to 300F.  Lightly butter the bottom only of a 9-inch
spring form pan with removable side.

In a medium-size bowl, combine the cookie crumbs, 2 tablespoons of the
sugar, the ginger, and butter. Press firmly into the bottom of the
prepared pan. Chill while making the filling.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat both
cheeses just until smooth.  Gradually add the remaining 1 cup of
sugar, beating just until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a
time, beating just until each is combined.  At low speed, beat in the
beer and heavy cream. Pour into the prepared pan.

Bake for 1 1/2 hours or until the center is set and the top is lightly
golden, but do not brown.  Turn off the oven and place a wooden spoon
in the door to hold it slightly ajar; let the cake sit in the oven
for 30 minutes.  Remove the cake to a wire rack and cool completely.
Chill for several hours or overnight.

Makes 16 servings.
