Combine in a large saucepan the beans, onion, carrot, celery, ham,

with the minced garlic, hot pepper flakes and the juice of 1/2 a
lemon. Set aside.

While the beans are cooking, combine the juice of a whole lemon,
olive oil, and basil leaves. Pour over the salmon steaks, and
refrigerate for 1 hour. Grill the salmon over a moderately high flame
for 4-5 minutes per side, basting with some of the marinade every
minute. Serve each steak with a portion of beans.
