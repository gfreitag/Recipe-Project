Title: CARROT PATE
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Carrots; sliced
1/4 c  Onion; diced
1 ea Garlic clove; slivered
1/4 ts Dill
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  -Water
1 tb Arrowroot; dissolved in
1 tb -Water
2 tb White miso
1/4 ts Sea salt
2 tb Tahini; optional
"For this recipe you may use a food processor instead of a blender to
puree the carrots. Mash the carrots roughly before pureeing them. You
might need to add a little extra water; in which case, simmer the
pureed, flavored carrots for a little while longer. The pare should
not feel wet. The additional of two tablespoons of tahini will make
the pate taste richer and help hold the ingredients together."

In a medium saucepan, saute the carrots, onions, garlic and dill in
the oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water, cover, and simmer until
the carrots are tender (about 20 minutes). Puree until a smooth paste
and return to the saucepan. Combine the dissolved arrowroot, miso,
salt and tahini, if you wish. Add this mixture to the pureed carrots.
Bring to a slow simmer, stirring constantly and cook until the pate
detaches itself from the sides of the pan. Remove from heat, turn the
pate mixture out onto a lightly oiled serving dish and let cool.
Serve the pate with crackers or toast, or serve it as a dip with
crisp, raw vegetables.
