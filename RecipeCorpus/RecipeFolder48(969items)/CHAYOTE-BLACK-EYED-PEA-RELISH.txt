Chef's Notes:  Stephan Pyles, the owner and chef of Dallas' hottest
new restaurant, Star Canyon, tells us: "Chayote, a green squash about
the same shape and size as a large pear, was a staple of the Aztecs
and Mayans, and it is still used extensively in Mexican and South
American cooking. In Louisiana and Florida, the chayote is known as
'mirliton.' It is more widely available during winter months and has
a crisp, crunchy texture and an earthy flavor that suits salsas and
relishes very well." Entered into MasterCook by Terri Law, 8/22/96.
