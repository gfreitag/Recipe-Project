Title: CARIBBEAN CABBAGE
Categories: Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Pork steaks
1    Small cabbage head
4    Carrots
1 c  Chicken stock or broth
1/4 ts Garlic salt
1 tb Ground Allspice
Salt & pepper; to taste
1 tb Butter, margerine or oil
2 tb Water; for deglazing
Brown pork steaks in butter, margerine or oil. Set aside to cool.
Deglaze skillet with 2 T water. Pour liquor into a 4 qt pot. Cut
carots into 1/8" thick slices. Add to pot and set pot over medium
heat. Add chicken stock, garlic salt, allspice, salt and pepper to
pot. Remove any bones from the pork steaks and cut them crosswise
into 1/4" wide strips. Add the pork strips to the pot. Core and
coarsly chop the cabbage. Add to pot. Stir well to mix all the
ingredients. Cover the pot and allow the meat and vegetables to steam
for a few minutes, but not too long. The carrots and cabbage should
still be somewhat crisp (al dente) when served. Serve with steamed
rice. OPTIONS: Alter spices any way you like. Add, delete or
substitute any of the ingredients. This dish is versatile, fast, easy
and very inexpensive. Since this is my first attempt at uploading
from MM to the Food Forum, I thought this was an appropriate recipe.
It's the first thing I ever cooked that had more than one ingredient.
It dates back to my college days (early 60's) when I, nor my
roommates, had much money. We had to build meals for four hungry guys
on a budget that allowed less than five bucks per meal. One of the
group hailed from Jamaica W.I. He devised this recipe based (loosly)
on something his grandmother prepared. It cost less than two bucks to
feed us all. Needless to say we started eating a variation of this
recipe almost every night. On Friday night we spent the money we had
saved to buy the five basic food groups (chili dogs, fries, pizza,
burgers and beer). Today, thirty years later, this recipe will still
feed four people for less than five dollers and takes less than 20
minutes to make.
