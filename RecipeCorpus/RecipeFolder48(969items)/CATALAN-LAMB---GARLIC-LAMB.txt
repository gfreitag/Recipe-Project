1    Shoulder of lamb
20    Cloves garlic, peeled
Flour
300 ml Stock

This recipe from northern Spain takes only minute of the cook's time
but produces melting lamb in a lush sauce, thick with sweet (and
innocuous) cloves of garlic.

In a wide casserole which can be used on top of the stove, heat a
tablespoon of olive oil and brown a shoulder of lamb on both sides.
remove the meat and add to the saucepan 20 peeled whole cloves of
garlic. Cook gently for a few minutes and sprinkle in a few
tablespoons of flour, stir well, then continuing to stir, add 300 ml
stock mixed with a tablespoon of tomato puree. Return the meat to the
casserole, turn it over in the stock mixture, cover tightly and
simmer very gently until the meat is cooked. Turn the meat over
halfway through cooking and check at intervals, adding more stock if
the sauce is getting dry.
