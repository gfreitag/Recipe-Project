Title: CARROT & ZUCCHINI VICHYSSOISE
Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 lb Carrots; chopped med. small
2 lg Onions; chopped medium small
Water (as needed)
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 1/2 lb Zucchini; peeled
- (reserve the skins),
-  and chopped medium small
1 lg Leek; well washed and
-  chopped medium small
In a large skillet place the first 1/4 cup of the olive oil and heat
it on medium high until it is hot. Add the carrots and onions, and
saut them for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are clear. Add
enough water to cover the vegetables.  Simmer them for 30 to 40
minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.  Place the vegetables in a
blender and pure them until they are smooth.  Set the pure aside
and let it cool.

In another large skillet place the second 1/4 cup of olive oil and
heat it on medium high until it is hot. Add the peeled zucchini and
leeks, and saut them for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are just
tender. Add enough water to cover the vegetables.  Simmer them for 25
to 30 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. Place the vegetables
in a blender and pure them until they are smooth. Set the pure
aside and let it cool.

Place the zucchini skins in a pot of boiling water and blanch them
for 3 minutes.  Drain the skins and place them in a blender. Add a
small amount of cold water and pure the skins so that a thick,
smooth consistency is achieved (the same consistency as the other 2
pures). Set the pure aside and let it cool.

Refrigerate the 3 soups until they are cold.

In each of 8 individual serving bowls place a portion of the 3 soups.
Swirl them together with a knife to form a design.
