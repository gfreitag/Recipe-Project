Recipe by: NDooley@president-po.president.uiowa.edu Mix all,
altogether. You may wish to combine the seasonings or grind them
together before adding them to the meat.

Shape in thumb-sized sausages, or in croquette size shapes.

Grill on open grill until done.

Serve with pita bread or hard rolls, and onions (raw or sauteed). The
smaller size works great for an appetizer (on a toothpick).

Traditionally, these are not served in barbeque sauce.
