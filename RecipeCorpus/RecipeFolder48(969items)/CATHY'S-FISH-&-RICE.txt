Title: CATHY'S FISH & RICE
Categories: Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb White fish (I used frozen
Pollock), cut in
1 sm Onion -- chopped
3    Cloves garlic
Handful cherry tomatoes
-halved
Some mushrooms -- sliced
Flour (for dredging)
Oil (for sauteing)
110 ml White wine
Curry powder
Black pepper
Cooked rice
1.  Saute the onions in a small amount of oil till they start to
soften. Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes, and then add the
mushrooms and cook for a few minutes more, till they lose their raw
look.

2.  Meanwhile, put a few tablespoons of flour and the pepper into a
plastic bag and shake the fish cubes in the bag (don't forget to
close the bag!) Remove the fish from the bag, shaking off any excess
flour.

3.  When the vegetables are cooked to your liking, remove them from
the pan and set them aside. You could drain them on a paper towel to
remove a bit of the oil, but it's not necessary.

4.  Add a little more oil to the pan, and heat it for a moment. Drop
the fish pieces in the oil, and saute them till them start to turn
opaque. Add the vegetables, the cherry tomatoes & the curry powder,
and stir to mix them in. Pour in the white wine (or other liquid of
your choice) and cook down till most of the liquid has evaporated.
Serve over rice.

Author's Notes: This is a recipe I made up the other night, when I
didn't feel like going out to the store. It's not exactly haute
cuisine, but it tasted OK, and used common ingredients. It'squick to
prepare, and doesn't taste very fishy since the dominant flavor is
the curry powder. (All measurements are approximate. This made more
than enough for 2 people).

The thing about this sort of recipe is that you can vary it in
countless ways ~- add some bell peppers if you want, or add different
spices. Use soy sauce and call it Oriental. Add a few hot chilli
peppers for more punch.

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: measure ingredients.
