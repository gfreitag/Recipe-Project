Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD (SELLERIESALAT)
Categories: Salads, German
Yield: 2 Servings
1 md Celery root (3-inch
-diameter), peeled,
Washed, and thinly sliced
1 c  Beef stock
2 tb To 3 tb salad oil
Wine vinegar
Salt
1 pn Sugar
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
Put the freshly sliced celery root immediately into the stock which
should be flavored with 1 tablespoon each oil and vinegar, 1/2
teaspoon salt, the sugar, and the chopped onion. Cook for about 20
minutes - until the celery root is quite tender and the liquid has
almost boiled away. Season the celery root and beef stock with the
remaining oil and a dash or two of wine vinegar, as well as with salt
if you wish.

Note:  If the salad is to be served as an appetizer, mix in some
coarsely chopped walnut and garnish with a few walnut halves.

Nowadays, in this age of crudites, it may be more usual to substitute
grated uncooked celery root, marinated in oil and vinegar, and
possibly mixed with grated raw carrot.

Makes 2 - 3 cups.
