Cut the flesh of the red snapper into 2" thick strips. Set aside. Add
the bones and trimmings from the fish to the boiling salted water.
Cook until reduced by 50%. Strain the fish stock. Set aside. Use a
heavy saucepan or Dutch oven to heat the butter and oil. Add the
onions. Cook until transparent. Add the tomatoes. Simmer until very
tender (about 5 minutes). Add the reserved fish stock, parsley, bay
leaf and thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil. Add the wine, salt and
pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Finely chop the almonds and the garlic. Use a grinder, mortar and
pestle or blender to make them into a paste. Add the paste to the
simmering wine sauce. Stir until thoroughly blended. Place the red
snapper slices in the bottom of a well buttered (2 1/2-3 quart)
casserole. Pour the sauce over. Cover. Bake until the broth begins to
simmer. Bake another 20 minutes. Serve from the casserole.
