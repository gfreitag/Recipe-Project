1 c  Boiling water
2 tb Vegetable oil
4    Lamb shanks
2 md White onions, halved
1/3 c  Raisins
2 tb Piloncillo, Mexican hard

1/2 ts Cumin
28 oz Tomato, whole peeled

1. Place chilies in small bowl with boiling water, let stand 1 hour
2. Heat lard or oil in Dutch oven over med. heat until hot. Add 2
lamb shanks. Cook turning often, until brown on all sides about 20
minutes. Remove to plate. Repeat. 3. Place chilies and 1/3 cup of the
soaking liquid in a blender and process until smooth. Discard
remaining soaking liquid. 4. Remove and discard all but 2 TBS oil
from Dutch oven. Add onions and saute' over medium heat about 4 mins.
or until soft. Reduce heat to med-low and stir in raisins, sugar,
garlic, oregano and cumin. Add chili puree and cook stirring
constantly for 2 minutes. 5. Add tomatoes, stock and bay leaves to
pan. Heat to boiling. Add lamb shanks and simmer over low heat,
covered, turning occasionally until lamb is very, very tender--about
2 to 2/12 hours/ 6. Remove lamb to serving platter and keep warm.
Skim and discard fat from cooking sauce. Stir in vinegar. Heat sauce
to boiling over med.-high heat and cook uncovered, stirring
frequently until sauce is thickened--about 10 minutes. Spoon sauce
over lamb. Serve, garnished with lettuce and olives (Maybe even some
quartered tomatoes). Accompany with Refried Beans garnished as
desired with shredded cheese and diced white onions. I recommend with
shanks that you clean them as well as possible of as much fat as
possible plus that white membrane. Don't remove all the membrane,
however, as something has to hold them together.
