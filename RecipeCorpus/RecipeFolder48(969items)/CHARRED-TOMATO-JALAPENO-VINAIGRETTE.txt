As soon as the snapper comes off the grill, sprinkle it with the
vinaigrette (which has to be at room temperature). The vinaigrette
heats up on the fish and all the flavors spring to life.

Brush the jalapenos and tomatoes with olive oil, and cook on the grill
until the skin is charred. Let the peppers and tomatoes cool and then
coarsely chop the tomatoes and slice the jalapenos thin.

In a large mixing bowl combine the remaining ingredients, including
the salt and pepper to taste, with the jalapenos and tomatoes, and
whisk until blended. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Spoon the vinaigrette, to taste, over the fish as soon as you take it
off the grill and serve immediately.

Yield: 2 cups
