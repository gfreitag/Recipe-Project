Preheat the oven to 450 F. Cut three-quarter-inch deep slits in the
meat, and insert garlic slivers. Brush the meat with two tablespoons
of oil. Heat the remaining oil in a heavy large skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the meat and brown on all sides. Do not wash
the skillet. Set the meat on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast to
desired doneness, about 30 minutes for rare.

For sauce: Melt one tablespoon of butter in the same skillet. Add the
shallots and cook until they are softened, about five minutes.

Pour off the fat from the roasting pan. Set the pan over high heat.
Stir in the broth, scraping up the browned bits. Add to the shallots.
Boil until the sauce is reduced by half. Add the Cognac and boil for
one minute. Reduce the heat to low, then whisk in the mustard. Stir
in the parsley. Whisk in the butter, one piece at a time. Season with
salt and pepper.

Cut the meat into half-inch slices. Arrange the slices on individual
plates, and spoon the sauce over. Serve at once.
