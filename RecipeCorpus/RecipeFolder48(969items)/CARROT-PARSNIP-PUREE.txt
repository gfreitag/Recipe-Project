Title: CARROT PARSNIP PUREE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Carrots, Peeled And Cut Into
- 3/4-Inch Pieces
1 lb Parsnips, Peeled And Cut
- Into 3/4-Inch Pieces
Salt To Taste
2 tb Heavy Cream
2 tb Butter Or Margarine
1 tb Bourbon
1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
Freshly Ground Nutmeg
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
The splash of bourbon along with the Tabasco sauce balances the
sweetness of the parsnips to give this dish a wonderfully mellow
flavor. In a 2-quart saucepan, cover the carrots and parsnips with
cold water. Add salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or
until the vegetables are tender but not mushy, then drain. Puree the
vegetables with the remaining ingredients on a food processor.
