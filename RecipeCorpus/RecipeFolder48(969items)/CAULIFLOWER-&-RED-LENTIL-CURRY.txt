Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Red lentils, rinsed
1 sm Onion, chopped
2 ts Madras curry powder,
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Turmeric
4    Plum tomatoes, chopped
4 c  Cauliflower florets

In a large saucepan over low heat, combine lentils, onions, curry

Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds
and cook for about 10 seconds.  Add garlic and ginger; saute until
the garlic is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Stir in cayenne and
immediately add the oil-spice mixture to the cauliflower mixture.
Stir in lemon juice, cilantro, and sugar. Taste and adjust seasonings
with additional salt and cayenne.

Serve over rice.
