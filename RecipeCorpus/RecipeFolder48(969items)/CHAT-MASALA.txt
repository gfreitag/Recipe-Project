Title: CHAT MASALA
Categories: Sauces, Indian
Yield: 1 Batch
2 tb Cumin seeds
1 1/2 ts Fennel seeds
1 tb Garam masala
1 tb Mango powder
1 tb Black salt
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1 pn Asafetida powder
1/4 ts Ground ginger
Asafetida, mango powder, and black salt distinguish the chat masala
from other masalas, giving the blend a sourness that makes it a
welcome accompaniment to fresh fruit and other snacks. ('Chat' refers
to various snacks and to the North Indian cafes that serve them.)
Fresh fruit often is sprinkled with lime juice and chat masala. Black
salt (which is actually reddish gray), available at Indian food
stores, has a distinctive flavor that's quite different from sea salt
or table salt. The garam masala is the wild card in this recipe;
either one of the (Tamil Nadu Curry Powder or Punjabi-Style Garam
Masala) masalas may be used.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Toast and grind cumin and fennel seeds and
combine with remaining ingredients.
