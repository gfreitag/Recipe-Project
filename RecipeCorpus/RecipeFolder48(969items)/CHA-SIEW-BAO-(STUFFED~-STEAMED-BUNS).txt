MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3    Scallions, minced
-(white part only)
1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger
2 tb Oil, peanut
1/2 lb Ground pork sausage
1.  For the buns, dissolve the yeast in the water.
Stir in the salt, and mix in the flour. 2. On a flat surface, knead
dough 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. 3. Place dough in an
oiled dish, turn over so the top is coated with oil, cover with a
cloth, and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour. 4. For the filling,
saute the scallions and ginger in the oil. 5.
Add the sausage and brown well, mashing the meat into small pieces.
Remove from the heat, and set aside. 6.
To assemble, punch down the dough and place on a flat surface. Break
off egg-sized pieces, and pat into 3 inch circles. 7. Place 1
tablespoon of pork mixture in the center of each circle. Bring two
opposite dough edges over the mixture and seal.  Cut off excess dough
from the remaining sides, leaving enough to seal in the pork. Gently
seal the sides and tuck under along the seam, forming mineature
loaves. 8. Cover and let rise for 15 to 20 minutes. 9. Over boiling
water, place the buns well apart in a steamer basket to allow for
expansion. Cover and steam for 5 to 10 minutes or until the surface
glistens and is firm to the touch.
Serve warm. Makes 10 to 12 buns.
