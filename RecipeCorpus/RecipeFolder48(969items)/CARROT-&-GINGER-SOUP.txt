Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Onion; chopped
1 tb Margarine
1 1/2 lb Carrots; sliced
1 ts Fresh grated ginger
Black pepper
4 1/2 c  Light vegetable stock or
-Water
1 lb Apples; peeled & chopped
3 tb Sherry
1. Saute onion in margarine, covered, for 5 minutes, without
browning. Add the carrots & ginger. Cover and cook a further 10
minutes. Stir occasionally.

2. Add the stock or water and bring to a boil, then simmer gently for
15 min, until the carrots are tender. Puree the soup in a food
procesor, then sieve (not really necessary).

3. Return soup to the rinsed-out pan, reheat gently and season to
taste with pepper.

You may use parsnips instead of carrots and add 1 T. curry powder to
the onions when you saute them.  A swirl of yogurt on top is good and
add some crisp croutons.
