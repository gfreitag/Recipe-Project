Charlene Prickett combines brain with brawn on IT FIGURES, her
long-running exercise show for Lifetime Television. "I have a real
academic streak," says Prickett. "I have a lot of interest in science
and in keeping up with the research that's always changing. Every
year I go to fitness conferences and sports-medicine clinics
throughout the country, and I always like to share what I've learned
by including an information element in my shows." So what does the
latest research say about the most effective way to get a good
workout? Says Prickett, "In terms of being optimally effective,
cross-training - weight training, along with some stretching and
aerobic activity - has come to be thought of as important. The
advantage is that you don't stress the body in the same way every
single day, and it prevents injury as well as boredom."

Prickett also believes that women have to work harder than men at
battling the bulge. "When you're young or if you're a man, the
likelihood of your staying near ideal weight with exercise alone is
good. However, if you're female or over 25, it generally takes both
regular exercise AND good food choices. That doesn't mean you can
never have an ice-cream sundae, but to stay at or near ideal weight,
you need to make discriminating food choices."

For dressing: mix all ingredients and chill.

For salad: mix all ingredients except lettuce in a bowl, add
dressing, and chill for 1 hour. Arrange lettuce leaves in a salad
bowl, add salad.

Garnish with lemon slices and chives.
