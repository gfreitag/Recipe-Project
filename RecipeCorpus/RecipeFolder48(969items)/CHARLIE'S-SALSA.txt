Title: CHARLIE'S SALSA
Categories: Mexican, Salsa
1 cn whole tomatoes
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 sm onion
2    Cloves garlic
3    canned jalapenos
1 ts honey

This is a recipe for salsa that is very different. I got it from a
longtime artist friend of mine who lives in taos, New Mexico. I don't
usually measure ingredients when I make it so use your own judgement.

Take 1 can whole tomatoes and extract the juice into a food
processor. I open the can, pour out the juice and then squeeze the
tomatoes with my fingers to extract more. Add onion, garlic,
jalapenos (or more to taste), and honey to the food processor or
blender. Process until smooth. Add the tomatoes and just hit the
button on the food processor a couple of times to chop the tomatoes.
DO NOT process them.  The salsa has a slightly sweet flavor due to
the honey combined with the hotness of the jalapenos gives it a
unique taste.
