Saute bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat until the fat begins
to render, about 4 minutes. Add butter and stir until melted. Add
onion, green and red peppers, celery, garlic, thyme and bay leaf.
Saute until the vegetables are almost tender, but not brown, about 8
minutes. Sprinkle the flour over vegetables. Stir 1 minute to cook
the flour. Gradually stir in the broth, scraping up the flour on
bottom of saucepan. Bring chowder to a boil. Add the corn and sugar.
Cover saucepan, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until
vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes, stirring the chowder
occasionally. Add cream, season chowder to taste with salt and pepper.

Transfer 1-1/2 cups of chowder to a blender and puree. Mix puree back
into chowder. Simmer 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Ladle into
bowls and top with a dollop of roasted pepper cream. Makes 4 to 6
bowls. Recipe By : Jurassic Cove Cafe / Philip Costner, executive
