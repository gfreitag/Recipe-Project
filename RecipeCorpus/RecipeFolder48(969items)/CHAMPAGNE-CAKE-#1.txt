2 3/4 c  Flour; sifted
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
2/3 c  Shortening
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  California champagne
6    Egg whites
******COCONUT FILLING*******
1/4 c  Butter
1 tb White wine
16 lg Marshmallows
1 c  Flaked coconut
******FONDANT FROSTING******
1 lb Powdered sugar
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
1/4 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 ts Almond extract
2    Or 3 drops red food coloring
6 lg Marshmallows
Sift flour, baking powder and salt together and set aside. Cream
shortening with 1 cup sugar until fluffy. Blend flour mixture
alternately with champagne and mix to a smooth batter.  Beat egg
whites until stiff and soft peaks form.  Fold about half the meringue
into the batter, mixing thoroughly with whisk. Gently fold in
remaining meringue. Turn into two greased and floured 9-inch cake
pans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until tested done.

When cake has rested 10 minutes, turn out to cool. When cold, put
together with coconut filling.  Over boiling water in double boiler,
melt marshmallows, butter and wine. Remove from heat and add coconut.
Sift powdered sugar in top of double boiler.  Add corn syrup and
water. Stir over boiling water until smooth. Add the vanilla, salt
and almond flavoring. For pink champagne effect, add 2 or 3 drops red
food coloring. Keep frosting warm so it spreads evenly. With spoon,
carefully pour fondant over top and sides of cake. Slice marshmallows
into 4 rounds each, dip in fondant and place at random on top of cake.
