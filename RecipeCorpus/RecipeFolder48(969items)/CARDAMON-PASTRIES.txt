Title: CARDAMON PASTRIES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
3 c  Plain flour
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Melted butter
1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Rum
3 tb Water
10    Cardamon pods pounded seeds
Removed and pounded again
Vegetable oil for frying
Icing sugar to dust
Sift the flour into a bowl and make a well in the centre. Break the
eggs in the centre and beat lightly with a fork. Add the remaining
ingredients, except the oil and icing sugar, and gradually
incorporate them into the flour.  Knead to form a smooth dough, wrap
in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Roll out the dough on a
lightly floured surface to form a thin even sheet and cut into the
desired shapes. Quickly deep fry the pastries in hot veg oil until
pale and crisp. Do not allow to brown. Set aside to drain and cool on
paper towels.  Dredge the pastries in icing sugar and store in a
covered container until ready to serve. Typed for you by Sherree
