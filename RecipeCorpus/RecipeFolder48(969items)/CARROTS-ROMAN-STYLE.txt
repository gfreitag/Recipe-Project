Title: CARROTS ROMAN STYLE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Carrots
8 sm Mint leaves
1    Lovage leaf; if available
-=OR=- several pale inner
- Leaves of Celery
2 ts Virgin olive oil
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
Salt
2 1/2 c  Water
1 tb Champagne vinegar
-=OR=- White Wine Vinegar
Freshly ground pepper
Finely chopped mint
-=OR=- Lovage leaves,
-  (for garnish)
SCRAPE THE CARROTS and slice them into pieces 2- to 3-inches long.
Cut each piece lengthwise into quarters or, if the carrots are very
large, into sixths or eighths. All the pieces should be about the
same size. Tear or chop the herbs. Warm the oil with the cumin seeds
and green herbs for a few moments to bring out their fragrances; then
add the carrots and toss them in the oil. Add a few pinches of salt,
the water, and the vinegar; bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and
simmer until tender, about 40 minutes. By this time, the liquid
should have reduced to almost nothing, leaving the carrots nicely
glazed. If the pan becomes dry before the carrots are done, add more
water in 1/4- or 1/2-cup increments until they are sufficiently
tender. When done, season with pepper and serve with a garnish of
fresh herbs.
