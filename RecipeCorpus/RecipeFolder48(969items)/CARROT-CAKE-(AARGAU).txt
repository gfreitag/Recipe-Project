The Story:

The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the main reasons
for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling industry. In this
area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and it has attributes
which allow it to be used everywhere, even in desserts.

This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been
extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain
that the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it
moist.

The Recipe:

Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest, until
light.

Add the finely grated carrots and the almonds.

Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder. Then
add the kirsch.

Mix or beat until smooth.

Beat the egg whites until stiff and carefully fold in.

Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the
mixture into the tin.

Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180 oC.

When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin fondant
icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.
