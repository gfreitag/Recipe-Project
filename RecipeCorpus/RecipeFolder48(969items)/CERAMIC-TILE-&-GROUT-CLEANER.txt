MMMMM------------------FOR HEAVILY SOILED AREAS-----------------------

** Safely removes soap film that forms on tile surfaces and between
tiles. A more concentrated paste of the cleaner can be made and left
to clean stubborn stains on the grout.

Pour baking soda into a clean gallon size plastic jug. Add ammonia,
vinegar, and warm water to fill. Swish jug to mix before it is
completely full. Cover tightly, label, and keep out of the reach of
children. Smaller pump-type containers can be filled from the jug for
small jobs--make sure these containers are labeled and kept away from
children.

To Use: Spray directly onto tile and wipe with damp sponge or
scrubbing pad for Teflon.

Hint: If tiles or grout are especially soiled, make a paste of baking
soda and CTGC. Brush onto stains with an old toothbrush. Let remain 5
mins, then scrub off and rinse.

Note: Contains ammonia. DO NOT MIX WITH ANYTHING IN THE BATHROOM
CONTAINING BLEACH OR DANGEROUS FUMES COULD RESULT. 1 gal.

Big savings.
