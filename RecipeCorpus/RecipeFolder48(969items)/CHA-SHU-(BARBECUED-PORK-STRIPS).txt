Title: CHA SHU (BARBECUED PORK STRIPS)
Categories: Pork, Barbeque
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Boneless pork butt
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
2 tb Chicken stock
2 tb Dark soy sauce
1 tb Soybean condiment
(mein see*)
1    Lrg. clove garlic, crushed
1 tb Chinese rice wine or
-dry sherry
1 1/2 tb Honey
3/4 ts Salt
2 tb Hoisin sauce
Few drops of red
-food coloring
Cut the pork into long strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches square. Mix all for
the marinade and marinate the meat for 3 hrs., unrefrigerated, or 6
hrs. in the refrigerator.  Turn the strips every hour or so.

Preheat the oven to 350^.  Place a large cake pan half filled with
water on the lowest shelf of your oven. This will catch drips from
the meat and prevent smoking. Place the meat strips directly on an
oven rack and put in the top position of the oven. Be sure that all
of the meat is over the dripping pan. Roast for 45 minutes without
disturbing the meat. Then, turn the heat up to 450^ and roast for an
additional 15 minutes or until the pork strips are crisp and a rich
brown color. Slice the meat and serve it hot or cold... or use in
other dishes as directed.

*Mein See:  The remains of the process of making soy sauce. Very rich
soybean condiment used in many Chinese dishes. Can be found in
Oriental markets under this name or soybean jam or condiment.
Refrigerate after opening.
