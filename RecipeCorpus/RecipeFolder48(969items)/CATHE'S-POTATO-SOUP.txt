1 ts Garlic, minced
1/2 ts Garlic salt
1 ts Black pepper, coarse

Cut potato into chunks and boil in water until quite done, a little
over-done.  You should end up with about a cup of water in the pot.
Mash potato chunks in pot with water; will be a juicy, mushy mixture.

Stir in spices, butter and half-and-half; mix well. Add paprika a
teaspoon or so at at time (to taste) until mixture thickens. Stir in
Tabasco sauce and serve.

*  Varies a lot from time to time; might need to experiment.
