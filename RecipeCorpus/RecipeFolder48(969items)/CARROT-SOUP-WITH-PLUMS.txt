Title: CARROT SOUP WITH PLUMS
Categories: Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Small carrots
1    To 2 small turnips
6    Cups, good homemade chicken
-stock
1 tb Honey
2 tb Dijon mustard
2    To 4 tbsp chopped parsley
1    To 2 tbsp chopped fresh
-tarragon
2    To 3 tbsp butter
6    To 8 pitted plums
Rind and juice of 2 oranges Salt and pepper

Grate the rind from the oranges.  Squeeze 1/4 cup fresh orange juice.
Clean the carrots and trim the stems. If the carrots are small, cook
whole; if they are larger, cut into any shape so they will cook in
about 10 minutes. Peel the turnips and cut into 1/2 inch pieces. In a
saucepan, cook the vegetables in the orange juice on slow heat until
tender. Add the chicken stock and let the vegetables steep on a slow
flame for another 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove to a blender and puree
until smooth; correct the seasonings.  Make a compound butter by
combining the orange rind, honey, mustard and herbs with softened
butter. Halve the plums and then slice each half into thin slices
that can be fanned out. Ladle the soup into bowls; garnish with a
piece of the compound butter and the plums.
