Title: CASHEW CRUNCH
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Honey
1 1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
2 c  Roasted cashews
In a heavy saucepan, preferably nonstick, bring the honey and lemon
juice to a boil over medium-high heat.
Add the nuts and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture
thickens and darkens (be careful not to let it burn), about 15-20
minutes. Pour out onto a nonstick pan, such as a jellyroll pan or a
large skillet moistened with cold water and spread to a thickness of
about 1/4 inch. Let cool completely. When fully hardened, break into
small pieces. Makes about 3/4 pound of candy. Store in a tightly
sealed tin.

Since I adapted this from a recipe for nuant, or walnut brittle, I
guess you can use any kind of nuts. You could dip the finished candy
in melted chocolate, too.
