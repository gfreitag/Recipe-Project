2 lb Pork tenderloin
2    Peppers seeded and stemmed

2 tb Peanut oil
5    Sprigs parsley
1 tb Vegetable oil

2 c  Cooked white rice

1 c  Sour cream
1. Trim the pork. Pound with a meat hammer to tenderize. Slice into
thin strips.

the food processor. Use the standard slicing blade. Pack the pepper
wedges and the bottom of the pepper horizontally into the feed tube,
and process.

3. Place the onion cut side down, and slice by hand into thin strips
(you want the strips of pork, chile, and onion of roughly the same
size).

4. Coat the bottom of a griddle with the peanut oil. Grill the pork,
peppers and onions over high heat until the meat is browned on all
sides (add more oil if needed).

5. Use the metal blade of the food processor to mince the parsley.
Melt the butter and vegetable oil in a 10-12 inch skillet. Toss in
the parsley and rice. Season with salt and pepper.

6. Place the rice on a warmed serving dish, and spoon the meat mixture
over. Top with warm Salsa Rojo.
