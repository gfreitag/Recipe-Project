Title: CAVATELLI WITH BROCCOLI & CREAM
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 2 Servings
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
4 tb Butter
1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
2 tb Marsala wine
1 c  Whipping cream
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 lb Cavatelli
1/2 lb Broccoli florets; parboiled
1/3 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
Cavatelli are small, ear-shaped pasta. This dish is more of an
American invention than a classic Italian dish, but it's delicious
just the same.

ADD THE LEMON JUICE to the mushrooms and mix well. Melt the butter in
a skillet; add the garlic and Marsala. Cook for 3 minutes, then add
the mushrooms. Cook for 5 minutes more. Add the whipping cream and
bring the mixture to a boil. Add some salt, then pepper liberally.
Remove from the heat. Cook the cavatelli al dente. Drain the pasta
and return it to the pan in which it was cooked. Add the broccoli and
the mushroom mixture to the pasta. Put the pasta mixture onto
individual serving plates and top each with grated Parmesan.
