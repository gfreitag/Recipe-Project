Title: CHANG-CHORIM (SP?)
Categories: Korean, Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
-I'm pretty sure my parents
-use stewing beef)
2    Scallions
3    Cloves garlic
1 c  Beef broth
1 c  Soy sauce
1/3    - 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
-dash black pepper
1) Place meat in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to boil,
skimming froth.  Simmer 2 hours. Remove meat from liquid and reduce
to 1 cup (or use canned broth and save this broth for something
else). Cool meat, then slice into pieces approx. 1 1/2 in. x 1 in. 2)
Coarsely chop scallions and smash and chop garlic. Place meat slices
into pan with scallions, garlic, beef stock and soy sauce and bring
to boil. Add cayenne and black pepper. Simmer 5 mins. 3) Remove pan
from heat and cool. Place contents in a container and refrigerate
(the fat will rise to the top and harden and can be easily removed).
This meat will keep indefinitely, but it's pretty tasty, so that's
not a problem with this small amount. I think this is the kind of
thing that is good to have on hand in the fridge to snack on (with
some rice and kimchee, of course) or as part of a simple meal.
