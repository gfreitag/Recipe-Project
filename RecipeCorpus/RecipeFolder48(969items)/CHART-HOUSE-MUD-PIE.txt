Title: CHART HOUSE MUD PIE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2 pk Nabisco chocolate wafers
1/4 c  Butter, melted
1 qt Coffee ice cream
1 1/2 c  Fudge sauce
Crush wafers and add butter, mix well.  Press into 9" pie plate.
Cover with soft coffee ice cream. Put into freezer until ice cream is
firm. Top with cold fudge sauce (it helps to place in freezer for a
time to make spreading easier).  Store in freezer approximately 10
hours.

Presentation: Slice mud pie into eight portions and serve on a chilled
dessert plate with a chilled fork. Top with whipped cream and slivered
almonds.

Gaye's Notes:  I first had mud pie on my honeymoon in

Honolulu in 1975. The Chart House was kind enough to share this
fabulous (and easy!) recipe with us.
