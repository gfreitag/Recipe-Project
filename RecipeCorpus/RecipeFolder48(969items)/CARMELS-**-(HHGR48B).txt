This is a recipe for carmels.  They can be soft or hard, depends how
long you cook them. My family makes them every holiday. It takes
awhile, but makes a lot. Combine in saucepan: Cook on med. til
dissolved, stirring constantly.  Cook to 240; stirring constantly.
Pour into well buttered pan (13x18-cookie sheet). Let cool. Cut in
strips and then into small pieces. Wrap each piece in wax paper.
Store where cool. Hope someone finds this interesting; it is
delicious.
It can also be used in recipes (turtles perhaps).
