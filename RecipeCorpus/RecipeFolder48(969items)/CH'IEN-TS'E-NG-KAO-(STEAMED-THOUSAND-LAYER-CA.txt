Categories: China, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
3 1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Lard or shortening
2 tb Red dates, chopped
Procedure:

1) Place flour in a large bowl.  Dissolve yeast in warm water (about
95 to 98 degrees F).  Add flour and knead about 5 minutes until mixed
well. Cover with a wet cloth and let rise until double in bulk.

2) Remove the dough to a pastry board.  Then roll until very thin,
about 2 1/2 feet long and 1 foot wide. Spread some lard and sprinkle
1 tablespoon of sugar and some red dates on the dough. Fold the right
1/3 portion to cover the middle portion and spread lard and sugar on
top evenly. Fold the left portion to the center to cover the right
portion.

3) Turn the dough around, so that a folded edge faces you. Repeat the
rolling procedure.  Spread lard and sugar. Repeat the folding step
twice. Finally fold the dough into 1 foot long and 8 inches wide. Let
the cake rest for 30 minutes.  Then place on a wet cloth on a steamer
rack. Put rack in place over boiling water. Steam about 50 - 60
minutes. Remove and let cool a little. Cut into small squares or
diamonds.
Serve.
