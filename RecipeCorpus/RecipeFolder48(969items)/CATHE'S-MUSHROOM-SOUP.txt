Title: CATHE'S MUSHROOM SOUP
Categories: Soups, Cathe
Yield: 1 Batch
3 tb Butter (more if needed)
2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
1/2 c  Burgundy wine, hearty
-(or less)
2 tb Flour
2 c  Half-and-half (or less)
Salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste
Saute mushrooms in butter until brown.  Add wine when mushrooms start
making their own juice; cook over medium heat until all liquid
evaporates and clear oil from butter is in pan, about 10 minutes.

Add flour and cook on high about 5 minutes; stir and blend, cook till
nut-brown.  (Like a medium brown roux, except for mushrooms and is
wine-colored.)  Can add more butter as necessary to make a smooth
"sauce" texture.  Stir constantly.

Stir in half-and-half (can substitute milk) until you have the
thickness or amount of soup you want; stir to creamy consistency.
Salt and pepper to taste.  Makes about 1 1/2 to 2 cups soup.
