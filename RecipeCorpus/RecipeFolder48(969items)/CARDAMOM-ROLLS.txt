Title: CARDAMOM ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Portion Four-Way Sweet 1 egg
-yolk
Bread Dough
-1 tsp. cream or canned milk
8    Pods whole cardamom
*Use Grated Raw Potato Starter

Remove cardamom seeds from pods and crush in mortar or place in small
plastic bag and use rolling pin. Flatten the ball of dough. Sprinkle
crushed seeds over surface and knead until evenly distributed through
the dough.  Divide in twelve pieces and shape as desired for muffin
tins. They can be made into a plain ball and then, after the top is
generously buttered, cut deeply with a Kaiser cutter or slashed with
a deep cross in the top with sharp knife or scissors. They are also
nice made up in brioche shape.  Cut off about 1/4 of the dough and
make a tiny ball to place firmly on top of the larger ball before
brushing all over with butter. When light, bake for about 25 minutes
in oven preheated to 350. About 5 minutes before the end of the
baking period brush the tops of the rolls with the egg yolk and cream
beaten together. Bake to a golden, glossy brown. These rolls are
perfect for serving with a chilled fresh fruit salad and whipped
cheese spread.
