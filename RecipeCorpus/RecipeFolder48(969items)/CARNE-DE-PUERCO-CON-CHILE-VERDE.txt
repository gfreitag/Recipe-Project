Title: CARNE DE PUERCO CON CHILE VERDE
Categories: Pork, Mexican, New_mexican
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Boneless pork roast
48 oz Tomatillos, drained &
-crushed
16 oz Green chiles; chopped
-(Ortega mild green)
5    Garlic cloves; crushed
1 lg Onion, chopped
3/4 c  ;Water
Salt
Pepper
optional -- your favorite fresh green chiles, chopped or sliced.
Cilantro if you like it.

Slice up the pork and trim away most of the fat.  Dice both the lean
meat and the fat into 1/2-inch cubes; set the diced fat aside.

In a heavy pot over a hot flame, cook the lean pork with the water,
stirring until the water is gone and the meat begins to brown. Add
onion & garlic, and stir constantly until the onion becomes
transparent.

Reduce heat to a simmer and add tomatillos & canned chilis (be *sure*
to drain the tomatillos before crushing; the water they are packed in
is too salty).

Cover the pot and simmer slowly for about an hour, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking.

Meanwhile, render the diced pork fat into cracklings by sauteeing in a
skillet over medium heat until the pieces are brown and crispy. Drain
and salt the cracklings and set aside; save the lard for any other
dish where you want some high-quality cholesterol stuff.

After an hour the chile verde should be pretty juicy but not watery.
Add a little water if it's too dry. Add salt & pepper to taste, and
if you want it hotter, add your fresh chiles now. Cover and simmer
again for at least half an hour.  The longer the better.

To serve, sprinkle with chopped cilantro (if used) and the cracklings.
Serve with Spanish rice, tortillas, black beans, and ice-cold beer.
Serves 6 or 8.
