MMMMM---------------------MIX AND SET ASIDE--------------------------
2 ts Cornstarch
1 c  Chicken broth
MMMMM----------------------CHICKEN MIXTURE---------------------------
2 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Soy sauce
2 lb Chicken breast, skinned
MMMMM-------------------VEGETABLE INGREDIENTS------------------------
4 x  Oil; Tbl - approx.
2    Celery stalk; thinly sliced
1/2 lb Green beans; 1/2" slices
2    Carrot; 1/4" slices
1    Onion; small, 1/4" slices
2    Garlic clove, minced/pressed
4 tb Water
2/3 c  Cashews; roasted
Mix the cornstarch with chicken broth and set aside.

Cut skinned and boned chicken into matchstick-size pieces. Combine the
ingredients for the "chicken mixture" ( cornstarch, soy, and
chicken). Mix well to coat chicken thoroughly; set aside.

Place wok in high heat. When wok is hot, add 2 TBL of the oil. When
oil is hot, add chicken mixture. Stir fry until chicken is opaque
(about 3 minutes). Remove chicken from the wok and set aside.

Add remaining 2 TBL oil to the wok. When oil is hot, add celery,
beans, carrot, and garlic. Stir fry 1 minute. Add water. Cover and
cook for 3 minutes or until veggies are just tender-crisp.

Return chicken and chicken broth mixture to pan. Stir until liquid
boils and thickens (about 1 minute). Stir in most of the cashews.
Garnish with the remaining cashews.

This recipe is from Sunset "WOK Cook Book" and is a delightful stir
fry.
