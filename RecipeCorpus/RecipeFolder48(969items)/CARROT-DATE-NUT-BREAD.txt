Drain, if all moisture has not evaporated. Put orange, buttermilk,

in dry mixture and mix until well blended but do not beat. Stir in
dates and nuts. Spread in 2 greased and floured small loaf pans
(about 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 x 2-1/2 inches).

Bake at 350 degrees F. 45  minutes to 1 hour, or until pick inserted
near center comes out clean.  Remove from pans to wire racks. Cool
overnight before cutting. Makes 2 loaves. Source: The Zucchini and
Carrot Book by Ruth Conrad Bateman.

Judi's Notes: One cup of sugar is sufficient for this bread and I
like to add 2 T of Orange Marmalade to the batter.
