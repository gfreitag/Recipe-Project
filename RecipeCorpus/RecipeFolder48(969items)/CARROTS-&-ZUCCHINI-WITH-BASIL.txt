"The tiny bush basil leaves are a perfect size to sprinkle whole over
crunchy vegetables.  Or chop whole sweet basil leaves, adding them
off the heat to retain color and flavor."

Wash zucchini and cut into 1/4" strips.  Put zucchini strips in
colander; sprinkle with salt.  Let stand 10 minutes to extract bitter
juices.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a heavy skillet.  Add oil and heat. Rinse
zucchini under running cold water and thoroughly pat dry.

Peel carrots and cut into 1/4" strips.  Add carrots to skillet; saute
6 to 7 minutes, stirring, over high heat, or until barely tender
crisp. Turn heat down to medium and add zucchini. Cook, stirring,
another 4 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in chopped fresh basil. Add
salt and pepper.

Spoon onto heated serving platter.  Garnish with tomato wedges and
whole basil sprigs.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
