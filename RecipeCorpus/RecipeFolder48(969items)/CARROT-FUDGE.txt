Title: CARROT FUDGE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Grated carrots
1/2 ts Lemon flavoring
3 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Sweetened condensed milk
1/2 c  Water
Cook carrots, sugar, milk, and water, to soft ball stage (234 - 238
F). Remove from fire, add flavoring, and cool to room temperature.
Beat until creamy.  Pour into buttered pan, pat down to 1 inch depth,
and when firm cut in squares.  The grain is likely to be a little
coarse due to the grated carrots. Mrs. L.G. Humichl, Perry, IA.
