"This delicious drink is great for kids who are lactose intolerant
because it tastes very creamy but does not contain milk. Although
optional, grenadine syrup (available in the soft drink section of
supermarkets) turns the shake a wonderful pink.

Peel banana and break into pieces. Place in blender or food
processor. Pour in pineapple juice, orange juice and grenadine syrup
(if using); blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add ice cubes;
blend for 1 minutes or until creamy and frothy.
