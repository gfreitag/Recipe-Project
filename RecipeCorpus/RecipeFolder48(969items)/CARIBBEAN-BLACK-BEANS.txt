Title: CARIBBEAN BLACK BEANS
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2    Chopped onions
3    Garlic cloves, chopped fine
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Fresh grated ginger root
1 ts Fresh thyme or 1/2 t dried
1/2 ts Ground allspice
4 1/2 c  Drained cooked black beans
(three 16-oz cans)
3/4 c  Orange juice
Salt and black pepper to
Taste
Saut the onions and garlic until barely soft.  Add the spices and saut
until very soft.  Stir in the beans and orange juice and saute for
about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Mash a
few of the beans with a fork or that back of a spoon. Add salt and
pepper to taste.

From the _Moosewood Cooks At Home_ book, again.  They are a little
dry on their own.  The book recommends serving them with Mango Salsa.
This is good but more work. They could probably be served with
regular, store-bought salsa and/or sour cream and/or guacamole.
