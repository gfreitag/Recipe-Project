Categories: Main dish, Korean, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
2 oz Cellophane mung-bean noodles
6 ea Chinese black mushrooms
1/3 lb Tender spinach leaves
1 ea Carrot
1 sm Zucchini
3 md Mushrooms
2 ea Chinese cabbage leaves
4 ea Scallions
4 tb Vegetable oil

Soak the Chinese mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for 20 minutes. When
they have softened, cut off the hard stems and slice the caps fine.
Drop the spinach into 10 cups of boiling water. Boil rapidly for 2
minutes. Drain. Run under cold water.  Squeeze out as much moisture
as possible. Peel the carrot, cut into 3 sections and then into fine
julienne strips. Wipe off the fresh mushrooms and break off their
stems. Cut the caps into very fine slices.  Cut the nonwoody part of
the stems into matchstick pieces. Cut away and discard the curly,
tender part of the cabbage leaves. Save only the V-shaped core of the
leaves. Cut this into julienne strips. Cut the scallions into
2-1/2-inch sections.  Quarter the section with the bulb lengthwise.
Combine the Chinese mushrooms, spinach, carrot, zucchini, mushrooms,
cabbage, and scallions in a bowl. Mix well, separating all the
spinach leaves. Heat the vegetable oil and the sesame oil in a wok or
a 10-inch saute pan over a medium-high flame.  When hot, put in the
garlic. Stir and fry for 10 seconds. Add all the vegetables in the
bowl. Stir and fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the vegetables are
tender-crisp. Turn the heat to low. Add the drained noodles, soy
sauce, and salt. Stir well, distributing the noodles evenly, and cook
2 to 3 minutes. Taste for seasonings.
