Combine all ingredients except chicken in food processor or blender,
and blend into a paste, making sure that the ingredients are all fully
integrated. The paste should be the consistency of a thick tomato
sauce. If its too thick, thin it with a little more white vinegar.

Cover the paste and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 2
hours, but not more that 2 weeks, for the flavors to blend together.
Overnight is ideal.

Rub the chicken with the paste and place over a very low heat. Or if
you have a covered cooker, put the coals to one side, the chicken to
the other and cover.

Cook about 1 hr without cover  or 1/2 hr if covered. The key here is
to use a very low heat.  Be patient. Hard to overcook, the only way
to screw it up is if you burn the paste by having the heat to high.
The longer the chicken stays on the grill, the more superior the
smoky flavor. Recipe By : Cecil AT From: Western Mexican Cookbook
