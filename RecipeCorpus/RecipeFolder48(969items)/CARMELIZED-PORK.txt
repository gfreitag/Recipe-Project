Title: CARMELIZED PORK
Categories: Vietnamese, Pork, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Fresh pork leg (ham)
1 tb Cooking oil
1 ts Salt
2 ea Green onions
1 ds Pepper
1 tb Fish sauce
Cut the fresh ham into several chunks about 1 1/2 to 2 inches square.
Chop the green onion fine.  Heat the oil in 2 quart pot, then add the
onion and the remaining ingredients, including the pork. Saute,
stirring, on medium heat until the meat is brown (about 5 minutes or
more). Add 4 cups water and simmer, uncovered, on medium heat for one
hour. Add the fish sauce and continue to simmer on medium heat 1 more
hour. Most of the water will be absorbed by the meat and the
remainder will be slightly thick--or carmelized.  Be careful not to
burn it. Serve hot as a main dish, with lots of rice.  This has a
very long life--it may be frozen, refrigerated, reheated, and served
as an appetizer, etc. Note: This takes a long time to cook, but is
very easy to do. In Hue, central Vietnam, pork belly is used in this
recipe. Bellyis very fat and is considered good in a cooler climate.
Don't discard the fat portions before tasting--it is surprisingly
good and surprisingly digestible. Recipe from: Vietnamese Cookery, by
