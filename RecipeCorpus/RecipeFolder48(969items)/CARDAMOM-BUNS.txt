Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, butter, salt and
cardamom into work bowl.  Process until mixed, about 10 seconds.

Add yeast mixture and 1 beaten egg to flour mixture. Process until
blended, about 10 seconds.

Turn on proecessor and very slowly drizzle just enough milk through
feed tube so dough forms a ball that cleans the sides of the bowl.
Process until ball turns around bowl about 25 times. Turn off
processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining milk to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough truns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Shape into a ball. Cover
with plastic wrap or inverted bowl and let stand at room temperature
until almost doubled, 30 -
45    minutes.

Uncover dough and divide into 12 equal parts.  Shape each into smooth
ball and place on greased cookie sheet. Let rise in warm place until
doubled, about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Brush rolls with egg white.  Mix sugar and ground
almonds and sprinkle over rolls. Bake until golden, 25 - 30 minutes.
Remove from cookie sheet and cool on wire rack.
