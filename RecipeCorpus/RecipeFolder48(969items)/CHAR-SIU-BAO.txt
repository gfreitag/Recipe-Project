3/4 lb Pork loin, boneless
Hoisin sauce
1 ts Cornstarch
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Soy sauce
1 ds White pepper
2 tb Oyster sauce
1/4 c  Chicken broth
2    Scallions
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 c  Milk; scalded
1/4 c  Sugar; (I add a little more)
1 tb Shortening
1/4 ts Salt
1 pk Yeast, dry
2 tb ;Water, warm
1    Egg white (opt)
3 c  Flour
Filling: Cube meat and stir fry in some oil with minced onion. (mush-
rooms and bamboo shoots can also be added) Cook meat until no longer
pink.

Add chicken broth to pan.  Heat to boiling, then cook covered for Stir
oyster sauce and cornstarch into 1 tablespoon water, add to pan. Cook
some more until thickened.

Dough:  Do the usual stuff about scalding milk, then stirring in
sugar, shortning, and salt; cooling the milk mixture; proofing the
yeast; etc. Stir the yeast and egg white into milk mixture, then pour
over 3 cups flour in bowl and stir until smooth.  Add more flour
until dough is easy to handle.

Knead, let rise, and punch down.  Divide dough into 20 pieces, roll
each piece into 3 inch circle.  Put 1 tablespoon of filling in
center, then twist to seal. Place on 3 inch square of waxed paper.
Repeat 19 times.

Cover & let rise 20 minutes, then steam.  I use a metal strainer in a
pot with a little water and a cheesecloth tied over the pot lid (to
prevent condensation).  Cover and steam for 12 minutes, then enjoy!
