Title: CARROT & POTATO PANCAKES
Categories: Pancakes
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1 lg Carrot
1 lg Potato
1/2    Onion
2 tb Chopped parsley
1    Egg
1 1/2 tb Milk
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tb Flour
Olive oil
Creme fraiche
These little pancakes, like a lot of now fashionable food, are
equally at home as nursery fare or as an entree or side-dish at a
smart dinner party. Nice served with a dollop of creme fraiche.

Grate (a food processor speeds things up) 1 large carrot, 1 large
potato and half an onion and transfer to a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons
chopped parsley, 1 egg, beaten, 1 1/2 tablespoons milk, salt and
pepper to taste and 1 tablespoon plain flour. (Add a little more
flour if the mixture looks too thin.) Heat a little olive oil in a
heavy frying pan and drop in the mixture by the dessertspoon if you
want elegant little pancakes, by the heaping tablespoon for a more
pedestrian size. Cook until brown and crisp on the underside then
turn and cook the other side. Serve.
