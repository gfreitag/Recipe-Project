Title: CARIBOU SAUSAGE #1
Categories: Game, Caribou, Sausage, Jw
Yield: 1 Batch
15 lb Caribou
5 lb Pork; fresh
3 oz Water
1 oz Pepper; black
3/4 oz Ginger; ground
1 1/4 oz Nutmeg; ground
1/2 oz Allspice; ground
1/2 oz Coriander; ground
2 oz Paprika
2 ts Garlic powder
10 oz Salt
1 tb Liquid smoke; opt'l
Sausage casings
Grind together the two meats and mix thoroughly. Add the water. Mix
the spices thoroughly and mix well into meat mixture. If sausage is
to be smoked, omit the liquid smoke.

You may stuff sausage into casings, making 6-8" links and smoke them.

OR make into patties for freezing.

Or boil them: Using a sausage stuffer, fill casings about 3/4 full to
allow for swelling. Tie the ends with string; put into a large kettle
of cold water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 1 hour, being sure
to prick each sausage with a fork after boiling 10 minutes. Drain and
cool.

They can also be canned after boiling.
