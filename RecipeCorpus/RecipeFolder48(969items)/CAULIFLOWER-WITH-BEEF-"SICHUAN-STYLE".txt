+++++ Combine soy and sherry for marinade. Marinate steak pieces for 1
hour.  Massage meat in marinade to aid tenderizing; drain, reserving
marinade.  Wash and soak mushrooms for 1 hour; drain, reserving
soaking liquid, thinly slice. Wash, peel and roll-cut carrots.
(Roll-cut means slicing on a slight bias in 1" lengths but turning
the carrot a quarter tur (90 degrees) between slices. Wash
cauliflower, trim off thick part of stems, and either break or cut
florets into pieces about the size of the carrot pieces. Parboil
carrots in boiling stock for about 3 minutes or until just beginnin
to soften. Reserve carrots and stock. Stir-frying: Heat peanut oil in
hot wok.  When oil just begins to smoke, add drained steak cubes;
stir-fry briskly for 1 minute until meat begins to lose pinkness.
Don't overcook meat or it will be tough. Remove to holding plate.
Swirl remaining oil into wok.
Add ginger, garlic and peppercorns; stir-fry 15 seconds. Add
cauliflower and mushrooms; stir-fry 1 minute. Add specified amounts
of liquids generated during preparation: reserved carrot stock,
marinade, and mushroom soaking liquid; bring to boil.  Cover wok;
reduce heat to medium, and simmer 3 minutes. Remove lid; turn heat to
high. When sauce boils again, add carrots and beef.  Mix together.
Splash vinegar down sides of wok. Push ingredients out of sauce,
thicken with thin cornstarch paste. Sauce should be a light gravy.
Add seasame oil.  Toss in green onion. Serve.
