Title: CARNE ADOBADO ( CHILE-MARINADED PORK )
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Chile caribe
4 c  Water
2 ts Salt
3    Cloves garlic
2 tb Ground Mexican oregano
2 tb Ground comino -- ( cumin )
5 lb Pork loin chops -- thinly
Sliced
Combine the Chile Caribe and water in  a blender ans whirl intul
mixed into a sauce. It will become somewhat thick, similar to ketchup
in consistancy. Add salt, garlic, oregano and comino to the sauce and
mix well. Trim the excess fat from the pork and lay slices flat in a
large baking dish. Cover with the sauce; turn the meat once to coat
evenly on both sides. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator
overnight. You can either cook this in the oven covered with aluminum
foil at 325 degrees for 30 minutes then uncover and bake another 30
minutes or grill over a fire with mesquite CHUNKS ( chips just burn
up, chunks give a much better flavor ) that have been soaked for
several hours in water. I prefer the grilling method. I also add a
touch of oil to the marinade and baste my pork loin with it when
grilling.  This makes great fajitas or just serve the meat as an
entree with rice and good beans.
