Categories: Appetizers, Vietnam, Seafood, Ham/pork
Yield: 80 Servings
2 oz Cellophane noodles, soaked i
-n warm water for 20 mi
1 lb Ground pork
1    Large onion, finely chopped
2 tb Tree ears, soaked in warm wa
-ter for 30 minutes, th
3    Cloves garlic, finely choppe
-d
3    Shallots or white part of 3
-scallions, finely chop
1 c  Crab meat; cartilage remove
-d and meat flaked
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
20    Sheets dried rice papers (ba
-nh trang)
4    Eggs; well beaten
2 c  Oil, peanut
Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Cut a round
rice paper sheet into quarters. Place the cut rice paper on a flat
surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten egg over the entire
surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for egg mixture
to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes about 2 minutes.
When you become adept at this, you can work on several wrappers at a
time. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 tsp.
of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold
the sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll. After
filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying  pan, put
the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate, and
fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown. (This is
Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).
