Parley to garnish
In a large skillet over medium to high heat cook and stir sausage and
garlic for about 10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remember that
the venison sausage has very little if any fat and it will burn if
you are not particularly observant.  Now add the mushrooms and the
onion. Cook for 3 to 4 more minutes.

Add the zucchini, summer  squash, tomatoes, basil, oregano and the
bouillon cube.  Add the chili powder and the hot sauce. Bring to a
boil, stirring all ingredients together.  Reduce the heat and simmer
for 15 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender but yet crisp.  Be
sure to stir occasionally so things don't burn on the bottom of the
pot.

When finished toss with pasta and then sprinkle on liberal amounts of
parsley.

Total preparation time should be less than 30 minutes.
