Title: CERVENY KAPUSTA
Categories: Loo, Vegetables, Polish
Yield: 3 -4 as a si
3 c  Rendered pork fat
-(trimmed from
-chops or roast)
Finely chopped onions
Paprika
1 md Head red cabbage
Salt
1/2 ts Paprika
Fresh ground black pepper
1 lg Apple, grated
2 tb White [sic] vinegar
1 tb White sugar
1/2 ts Caraway seeds
Render pork fat very slowly; remove "cracklings", & add enough finely
chopped onion for taste and flavor. Cook until golden. Add paprika
slowly, DON'T let it burn or smoke. Let cool, and store, covered in
refrigerator - will keep for a long time.

Wash the cabbage in cold water, quarter it & chop finely, salting as
you go. Discard the core. Heat about 3 cups of the pork-fat/onion
mixture, add about 1/2 teasp. paprika - don't let it burn. Add the
wet, salty cabbage & stir until it's coated with fat. Add pepper to
taste, grated apple, stir in; add about 2-3 tsps wine [sic] vinegar,
1 tbsp sugar. Rub about 1 1/2 tsp caraway seeds between palms, & add
to cabbage.

This totally "handed-down-through-the-Wincenc-family" recipe will
come out differently each time - until you arrive at the taste you
like best. Taste as you go along! But the true test will be on the
2nd or 3rd day when reheating the left-overs. I always loved it best
then!!
