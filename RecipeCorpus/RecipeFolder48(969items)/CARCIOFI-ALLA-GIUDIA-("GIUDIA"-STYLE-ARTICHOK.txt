Title: CARCIOFI ALLA GIUDIA ("GIUDIA" STYLE ARTICHOK
Categories: Vegetables, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
8 lg Fresh artichokes, sized
1    Lemon
Salt
Fresh ground black pepper
Extra virgin olive oil
Parsley, fresh, chopped
Snap off the artichoke stems, remove any tough or blemished petals,
then snip off prickly tips. Place artichokes in boiling water with
lemon juice and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove, pat dry and
sprinkle insides with salt. Set artichokes stem-down in a deep
stainless-steel kettle just large enough to hold them snugly. Add
enough oil to reach halfway up the artichokes. Bake uncovered in an
oven preheated to 200C(400F) for 10 to 20 minutes (time depends upon
the qualify of the artichokes). When cooked, discard most of the oil
and season generously with pepper and parsley. Serve immediately.
