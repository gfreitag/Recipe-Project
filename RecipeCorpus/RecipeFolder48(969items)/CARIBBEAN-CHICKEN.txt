1/4 ts Coarse black pepper
1 1/2 c  Orange marmalade

In a small saucepan, melt 1 cup butter over low heat, stir in 1/3 cup
lemon or lime juice, Italian seasoning, 2-1/2 teaspoons salt, garlic,
dry mustard, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Sprinkle each side of chicken
halves lightly with salt and pepper.  Place chicken on grill skin
side up; brush with herb butter. Grill about 4 to 5 inches from

the marmalade mixture on each chicken half to glaze; grill about 1
minute. Turn chicken; brush with remaining marmalade mixture; grill
about 1 more minute. Makes 6 servings.
