This is a simple meat roast for Passover.  It is usually served with
Kifte de Prasa.  It so be noted that some Greek families did not eat
boiled potatoes on Passover since they consider that the cooked
potato "rise up" like the leavened bread.  Rice is another food that
is forbidden on Passover, yet the Jews of India do eat rice
throughout the year. The Passover laws vary from region to region,
each community establishing its own tradition.
