Title: GERMAN EGG DUMPLINGS WITH CHERVIL
Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, German, Side dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
3 lg Eggs; beaten lightly
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
1 ds Grated nutmeg
1 tb Minced chervil or
1 tb Italian flat-leaved parsley
-- minced
1/2 c  Milk or water
-- or more as needed
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except butter, adding
enough liquid so that batter is the consistency of a thick crepe
batter. With a wooden spoon or spatula, beat batter in a circular
motion, to incorporate as much air as possible into the dough (about
5 minutes). Allow dough to rest 10 minutes, then beat again another 5
minutes.

Bring lightly salted water (or stock) to a boil.  Turn heat down so
water just simmers.  Using a large-holed colander, vegetable mill,
spatzle cutter or a pastry bag, drop small bits of dough into
simmering liquid. (If using colander, press batter through holes.
With pastry bag, break off small bits with a knife; or place a flat,
large-holed cheese grater over top of pot and press batter through
the openings with a spatula.) When cooked, spatzle will rise to the
surface (about 5 minutes).

Remove with a slotted spoon, rinse under cold water and drain well.
(To keep ahead of time, place spatzle on a damp towel and
refrigerate, up to a day or two.)

To reheat, place butter on a large baking pan and place in moderate
oven to melt butter.  Spread spatzle on pan and toss to coat with
butter. Heat, uncovered, in 350 F. oven until golden brown and
slightly crisp. Or saute in butter.

Good served with veal or pork chops and sour cream gravy.
