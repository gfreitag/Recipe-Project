Title: GARLIC STRAWS - NSVHOL
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 20 Straws
1/2 lb Puff pastry
Juice of 2-3 garlic cloves
2 oz Milk
1 ts Paprika
1 tb Parmesan cheese
Salt and cayenne pepper
Preheat oven to 425F. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured board
into a rectangle, as thinly as possible. Stir the garlic juice into
most of the milk and brush the pastry with half of it. Mix the
paprika and Parmesan, and season with a little salt and cayenne.
Sprinkle half of it over one half of the pastry. Fold the pastry and
roll out as thinly as possible.

Repeat with the remaining garlic milk and Parmesan mixture and roll
out to a rectangle not more than 1/4 inch thick. Brush with milk and
cut into strips about
1/2    inch wide and 6 inches long.

Arrange the straws, at least an inch apart, on greased baking sheets
and bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until well-risen and golden brown.
Serve warm, piled onto each other, log cabin style.
