Title: FUFU
Categories: Dumplings, Ghana
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 c  Bisquick
2 1/2 c  Instant potato flakes
Conventional west African fufu is made by boiling such starchy foods
as cassava, yam, plantain or rice, then pounding them into a
glutenous mass, usually in a giant, wooden mortar and pestle. The
first early-morning sounds of rural west Africa are often the
rhythmic thud-thud's of fufuf being made. This adaptation for North
Americans may trouble you if you try to stick to minimally-processed
foods. But it's worth trying at least once with west African
groundnut stews or Egusi soup. Recipe By : From:
