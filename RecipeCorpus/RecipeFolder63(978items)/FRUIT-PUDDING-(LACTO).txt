Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 lg Cooking apple (would work
Fine with a dessert apple)
1    250 gram packet of
Ready-to-eat prunes
4 tb Sugar
1 c  Water
1 ts Lemon juice
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
3/4 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 pn Salt
1/3 c  Skimmed milk, or substitute
2 tb Apple sauce
1 tb Sugar
Take a a pan that can go from stove to table; I have an 8-inch
diameter enamelled steel casserole that works well.

Peel, core, and slice the apple. Place it in the pan with the prunes,
sugar, water, and lemon juice. Bring it to a boil.

While it is heating, sift the flour with baking powder and salt, then
stir in the milk and apple sauce. Drop the mixture by teaspoonfuls
onto the hot fruit, then sprinkle with the remaining tablespoonful of
sugar.

Cover the pan and simmer for 15 mins. Serve hot.
