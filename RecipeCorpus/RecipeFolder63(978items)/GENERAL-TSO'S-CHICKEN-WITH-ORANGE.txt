This popular dish gets a lift from the addition of orange peel, hence
its other name, Orange Peel Chicken.

CUT CHICKEN INTO THIN SLICES 2 inches long, cutting against the
grain. Put it into a bowl together with the soy sauce, rice wine or
sherry, ginger, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Mix well, and
then let the mixture marinate for about 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a
wok or large skillet until it is very hot. Remove the chicken from
the marinade with a slotted spoon. Add it to the pan and stir-fry it
for 2 minutes until it browns. Remove it and leave to drain in a
colander or sieve. Pour off most of the oil, leaving about 2
teaspoons. Reheat the pan over a high heat and then add the dried
chiles. Stir-fry them for 10 seconds, and then return the chicken to
the pan. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir-fry for 4 minutes,
mixing well. Serve the dish at once.
