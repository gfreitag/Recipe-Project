Title: GADSBY'S TAVERN SALLY LUNN BREAD
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  (plus) milk
1/2 c  (short) melted shortening
3 1/4 c  Flour
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 oz Active dry yeast
4 tb Warm water
1    Egg
Heat milk and shortening to the temperature of a warm baby bottle. Mix
flour, sugar, and salt in a separate bowl. Add warm water to the
yeast in a separate bowl. Add the warm milk and shortening to the
flour, then add the yeast and the egg.

Beat the entire mixture until it comes off the side of the bowl
cleanly.

Cover, let rise in a warm still place until doubled in size, about 1
1/2 hours. Knead the bread down in size and shape into a loaf. Place
on a buttered cookie sheet and let rise to half again as big, about
45 minutes.

Bake at 300 F for approximately 45 minutes, basting the top with
butter after 30 minutes and after it has finished baking.

This is the recipe for the substantial Colonial-style bread served at
Gadsby's Tavern in Alexandria, Virginia.
