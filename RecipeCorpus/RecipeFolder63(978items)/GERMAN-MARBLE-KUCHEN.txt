Categories: Cakes, German
Yield: 1 Cake
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
3/4 c  Chocolate syrup
1/4 ts Soda
1/2 ts Salt
3 c  Sifted flour
3    Unbeaten eggs
2 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1 c  Milk
1 c  Butter or margarine
Sift flour with baking powder and salt. Cream butter thoroughly,
gradually add sugar, creaming until light and fluffy. Blend in eggs,
one at a time, beating well after each. Combine milk and vanilla. Add
alternately with dry ingredients. Blend thoroughly after each
addition.

Pour 2/3 of batter into 10" tube pan (the bundt is fluted, right?
that's what we use), greased on the bottom. Blend into remaining
batter the chocolate syrup and baking soda. Pour chocolate batter
over white batter. Do not mix. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes. Place a
sheet of aluminum foil on top and bake for 20 or 25 more minutes.
