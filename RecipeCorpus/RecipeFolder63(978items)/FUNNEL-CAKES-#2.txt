Title: FUNNEL CAKES #2
Categories: Desserts, Ethnic
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/4 ts Salt (optional)
1/2 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Baking powder
2 ts Honey
1 ea Egg
7/8 c  Warm milk
1 x  Oil for deep frying
1 x  Honey or maple syrup
Sift together all the dry ingredients and then add the honey, egg,
and the milk.  Beat until smooth. Heat about 2 inches of the oil in a
large cast-iron skillet. To test the correct temperature, drop a
small piece of dough into the oil.  If it floats to the top and
bubbles appear around the edges, you are ready to make the funnel
cakes.
Hold your finger at the bottom of the funnel and pour in some batter.
Then, using a spiral motion, let the batter pour into the oil. The
cakes should look like free-form spiral sculpture. Fry until golden
brown, turning once.  Drain on paper towels. Drizzle with honey oar
maple syrup and serve hot.
The amount you can make will depend upon the amount of batter your
use for each cake.
