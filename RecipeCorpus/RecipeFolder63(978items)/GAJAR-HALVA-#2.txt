Title: GAJAR HALVA #2
Categories: Candies, Indian
Yield: 6 Servings
6 md Carrots;scraped/coarse grate
1 qt Milk
1 c  Light cream
1 c  Jaggery (raw cane sugar)*
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Almonds, blanched;pulverized
1/4 c  Ghee
1/2 ts Cardamom seeds; crushed
1/4 c  Pistachios; toasted/unsalted
1/4 c  Almonds; unsalted/slivered/
-blanched/toasted
* Substitute 1 cup dark-brown sugar combined with 1 tb dark molasses

In a deep heavy 5- to 6-quart saucepan, combine the carrots, milk and
cream. Stirring constantly, bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce
the heat to moderate and, stirring occasionally, cook for 1 hour, or
until the mixture has reduced to about half its original volume and
is thick enough to coat a spoon heavily. Stir in the jaggery and the
sugar, and continue cooking for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to the
lowest possible point, add the pulverized almonds and the ghee, and
stir for 10 minutes more, or until the halva mixture is thick enough
to draw away from the sides and bottom of the pan in a solid mass.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cardamom.

With a metal spatula, spread the halva on a large heatproof platter,
mound it slightly in the center, and decorate the top with pistachios
and slivered almonds. Serve warm or at room temperature. In India,
gajar halva is also sometimes decorated with a special edible silver
leaf.
