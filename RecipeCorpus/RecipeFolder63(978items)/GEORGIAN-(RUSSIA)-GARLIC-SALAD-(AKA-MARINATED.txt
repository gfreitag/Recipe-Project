Title: GEORGIAN (RUSSIA) GARLIC SALAD (AKA MARINATED
Categories: Salad/dress, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
50    To 75 cloves of garlic,
Peeled
1 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice (or
Balsamic vinegar)
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground or cracked
Black pepper
1 tb Herbs (oregano is nice, or
Create your own mixture)
Start by peeling all that garlic.  Now bring a saucepan of water to
boil. Once the water is boiling, turn off heat and drop garlic cloves
into hot water. Let sit in water for 3 to 5 minutes. (Use the shorter
time if you like a sharper raw garlic flavor; the longer time results
in a much milder garlic flavor.) Remove garlic and plunge into (or
rinse thoroughly with) cold water to stop the cloves from "cooking"
any further.

Dissolve the salt into the lemon juice. Now make a "viniagrette" with
the olive oil, lemon juice/salt, pepper and herbs. Place garlic into
jars and pour oil mixture to top the cloves. Refrigerate for a
minimum of 1 week.

After one week, eat straight (or, for the faint of heart, slice up
garlic and mix with your salad greens). Be sure to keep refrigerated.
I don't know how long this will last in the refrigerator because I
eat it up too fast.
