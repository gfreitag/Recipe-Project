For the best results use skinned deboned legs of capon. Cut the
chicken into pieces no larger than 1 inch square. Prepare marinade by
combining egg white, cornstarch and 1 tablespoon soy sauce in a large
bowl. Add chicken pieces and set aside for two hours. In a deep pot,
heat the oil until it reaches 350 degrees. In a basket, or with a
slotted spoon, lower several marinated chicken pieces into the fat.
Fry about one or two minutes or until the chicken becomes crisp; test
for doneness before completing the batch. Continue until all pieces
have been fried. Set oil and cooked chicken pieces aside. In a wok,
on high heat, reheat two tablespoons of the reserved oil. Add
prepared ginger, scallions, garlic and chili peppers. Stir to prevent
burning. Add the fried chicken and stir quickly.Add sugar, soy sauce,
vinegar and cornstarch mixed with chicken stock. Remove from the heat
and stir sesame oil into the sauce. Spoon the mixture on to a hot
platter and serve immediately with steamed rice.
