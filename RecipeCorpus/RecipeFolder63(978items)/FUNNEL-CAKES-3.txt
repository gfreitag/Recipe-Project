Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1 ea Egg, beaten
2/3 c  Milk
Sift all dry ingredients together.  Mix egg and milk together; add to
dry ingredients.  Beat until smooth. (More milk will be needed, but
add it gradually until the consistency of pancake batter.) Fill pan
with 1 inch of cooking oil and heat as for cooking doughnuts. Hold
finger over bottom of funnel.  Pour in about 1/4 cup batter. Remove
finger and let batter drop in spiral motion into pan of hot oil.  Fry
until golden brown, turning once with tongs.  Remove from pan and
drain on paper towel. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve hot.
Makes 6 funnel cakes. (At the fair, these are also served with a
cinnamon/sugar mix sprinkled on them. I'm still trying to decide
which is better. I think I need to try both of them again <g>.)
