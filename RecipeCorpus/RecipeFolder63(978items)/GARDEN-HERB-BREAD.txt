NOTE:  I rewrote the recipe to follow order of my machine. It works
wonderfully in my Panasonic.

This bread tastes like stuffing!  It is WONDERFUL!!!! Here are some
hints from the book: 1. Use dried herbs that are flaked and not
ground. If using ground, reduce the amt. by half. If using fresh
herbs, double the recipe.

2.  This recipe can be made with the regular, rapid, or delayed time
bake cycles.

This recipes comes from "Bread Electric" from the Innovative Cooking
Enterprises.  I make the regular size loaf in my machine. Marilyn
