General Instructions Follow
Do not stir fudge once the boiling starts, unless the recipe
specifically requires it; unnecessary stirring may cause graining.
Beating fudge is very important. While fudge is cooling, it is
necessary to make the fudge creamy and smooth. Beating must be
started while fudge is comfortably warm and continued until it is
almost firm. For fudges that require cooling and beating, beat hot
fudge in pan or pour the hot fudge on a marble slab or formica; cool
to lukewarm, then paddle with spatula, until of the right consistency
to spread.
Marshmallow creme may be mixed into many of the following fudge
recipes just before the fudge sets up to make a softer, lighter
fudge. If fudge is overcooked, marshmallow creme will help it from
becoming hard and dry.
