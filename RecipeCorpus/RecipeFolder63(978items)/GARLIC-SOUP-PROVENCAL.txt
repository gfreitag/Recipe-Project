Title: GARLIC SOUP PROVENCAL
Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Herbs
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Heads of garlic
2    Leeks, thinly sliced
1 tb Olive oil
3 pt Chicken stock
2 c  Quartered tomatoes
1 lg Peeled potato cut in 2-3
Chunks
1/16 ts Crumbled saffron
2 tb Minced fresh sage
2 ts Minced fresh thyme
2    Sprigs chopped fresh parsley
To peel the garlic, separate the cloves and drop them into boiling
water for 30 seconds, drain, rinse the cloves in cold water, then
peel them. Saute the sliced leeks in the oil until tender, then put
them and all the rest of the ingredients into a soup pot and bring
the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 35 to 45
minutes, or until the garlic is tender and dissolving. Fish out the
cooked potatoes, whip them until smooth, then reserve them.  Strain
the soup through a sieve, pressing to get all the garlicky goodness
into the strained soup. Add the reserved potatoes, and whisk them in
until smooth.
