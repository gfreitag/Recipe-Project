the whole mass with a spatula fairly frequently until a nice brown
crust has formed. Serve hot. Makes 6 servings. Food Exchanges per
servings: 1 STARCH/BREAD EXCHANCE + 1 FAT EXCHANGE (If you make the
potatoes medium which would about 1/2 cup for Starch/bread exchange &
cut back on the oil by using a pan spray and use 1 fat exchange per
serving. This is really a dish that Bert would enjoy).
