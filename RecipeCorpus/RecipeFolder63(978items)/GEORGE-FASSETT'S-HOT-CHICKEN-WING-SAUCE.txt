Title: GEORGE FASSETT'S HOT CHICKEN WING SAUCE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Cup  Text only: "Melt 1/2 pound of butter and mix with as much Hot Tabasco
sauce as you can stand. For super hot, add the whole bottle (now,
that can get really hot depending on the size of the bottle you buy!).

Salt and pepper to taste, usually fairly heavy on the salt (keeps you
eating the wings, like popcorn despite the fire coming out of your
nostrils!)

Don't forget celery and blue cheese dressing to cool down the insides
of your mouth enough to go back and have some more!

A trick I like... coat your wings in this mixture, and then deep fry
them, and then coat again when done. Makes the wings nice and crispy!"
