=======================================================
==================
In boiling water over medium heat, cook potatoes in their skins
until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes. Drain and dry over low heat in
same pan.
While still warm, peel and cut potatoes into 1/4-inch thick
slices. Set aside and keep warm.
In a saucepan, combine green onions, broth, olive oil, vinegar,
mustard, celery seeds and salt and pepper to taste; simmer 2 minutes.
Cool slightly.  Stir in sour cream, mixing well. Pour dressing
over warm potatoes and mix gently. Sprinkle dill on top of salad and
serve at room temperature.
