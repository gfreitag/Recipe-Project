Title: FRUKTSOPPA (OLD-FASHIONED FRUIT SOUP)
Categories: Swedish, Soups/stews, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Dried apricots
3/4 c  Dried prunes
6 c  Cold water
1    Cinnamon stick
2 sl Lemon; 1/4" thick
3 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Raisins
1 tb Dried currnats
1    Tart cooking apple; peeled,
-cored & cut into 1/2"slices
Soak the dried apricots and prunes in 6 cups cold water for 30
minutes. Since the dried fruit expands considerably as it absorbs the
soaking liquid, you will need a saucepan (of stainless steel or
enamel) with a capacity of at least 3 quarts. Add the cinammon stick,
lemon slices, tapioca and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat,
cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden
spoon to prevent the fruits from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
Stir in the raisins, currants and apples slices and simmer an
additional 5 minutes, or until the apples are tender and offer no
resistance when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer. Pour
the contents of the saucepan into a large serving bowl and let cool
to room temperature. Remove the cinammon stick, cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate to chill. Serve the fruit soup in compote dishes
or soup bowls as a light year-round dessert.
