Categories: Breads, Desserts, Kids
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  All purpose flour
3 tb Granulated sugar
4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Cold butter
3/4 c  Milk
6 tb Brown sugar, packed
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 tb Butter, melted
YOU WILL NEED: a medium bowl, 2 mixing spoons, measuring spoons,
measuring cups, a pastry blender, a sharp knife, a small bowl, a
small saucepan, a hot pad, a pastry brush, a cookie sheet, oven mitts
and a wire rack. 1. Turn the oven on to 400 F. Measure the first 5
ingredients in the bowl. Stir well. 2. Add the butter and cut it in
with the pastry blender until it is in tiny pieces and the whole
mixture is crumbly. 3. Add the milk. Stir until it pulls away from
the side of the bowl and forms a soft ball. Turn out onto a lightly
floured surface. Knead 8 times or until dough is smooth. Cut the
dough into 2 equal portions. Cut each portion in half making 4 pieces
of dough. Now divide each piece into 3, making a total of 12 pieces.
Using the palms of your hands, roll each piece into a long rope at
least 12 inches long. 4. Measure the borwn sugar and cinnamon into
the small bowl. Stir well until evenly mixed. Pour onto working
surface. Spread into a rectangle about 4x14 inches. 5. Put the second
amount of melted butter into the saucepan.  Use the pastry brush to
brush another rectangle on the working surface, the same size as the
sugar-cinnamon. Roll 1 rope at a time in the butter, then roll it in
the sugar-cinnamon to coat. Roll up like a spiral or pinwheel, like a
snake might curl up. Pinch the last 1/2 inch of the end flat and tuck
it underneath the bun. Arrange the buns on the greased cookie sheet.
Bake on the center rack in the oven for 12-15 minutes. A wooden
toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean. Use the oven
mitts to remove the baking sheet to the wire rack. Cool. Makes 12
buns.
