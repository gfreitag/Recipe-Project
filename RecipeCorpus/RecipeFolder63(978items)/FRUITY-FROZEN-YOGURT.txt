Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
2/3 c  Sugar (or vary based
-on sweetness of fruit)
1/2 c  Orange juice
2 c  Fruit, cut into pieces
2 ts Lemon juice
1 c  Yogurt, plain
2    Egg whites
Combine sugar and orange juice in a saucepan.  Heat and stir until
sugar is dissolved.  Set aside to cool.

Whirl fruit and lemon juice in blender until fruit is pulp. Add
yogurt, blending well.  With motor running, add cooled orange juice
mixture.

Pour into a 9-inch square, flat pan and place in freezer for two
hours or until mixture is frozen into a slush. Break up mixture and
put in mixer bowl. Beat until smooth, adding eggs one at a time.
Continue beating until light and fluffy.

Return to pan or freezer-proof dessert containers and freeze until
firm, about one hour.

For very juicy fruit, such as raspberries or frozen fruit, the orange
juice may be decreased in proportion to the amount of juice. Increase
the lemon juice by 1 teaspoon for each 1/8 cup the orange juice is
decreased.
