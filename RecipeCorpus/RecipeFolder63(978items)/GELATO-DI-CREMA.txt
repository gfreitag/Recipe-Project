Title: GELATO DI CREMA
Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 8 Servings
2/3 c  Sugar
4    Egg yolks
1 c  Milk; at room temperature
1 pn Salt
1    Lemon peel strip (2-in)
1 c  Whipping cream
BEAT SUGAR AND EGG YOLKS together until pale yellow and very thick.
Slowly add milk, beating gently to avoid a build-up of foam. Add
lemon peel and stir in salt. Transfer mixture to the top of a double
boiler with an inch of boiling water in the bottom half. Regulate
heat so water remains at a low boil, and stir continuously 8 minutes.
Custard will thicken enough to coat the spoon, and surface foam will
disappear. Immediately remove top of double boiler and set it in a
large bowl of cold water. Stir 2 minutes to cool custard somewhat.
Then transfer it to a bowl, cover, and set in refrigerator to chill
thoroughly. Also chill whipping cream. When ready to proceed, whip
cream into soft peaks. Remove lemon peel from custard and fold in
whipped cream. Transfer mixture to ice cream machine and freeze
according to machine's directions. Makes 1 Quart
