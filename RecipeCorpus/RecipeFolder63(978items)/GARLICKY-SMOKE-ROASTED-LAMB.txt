1 Alder wood chips produce a delicately flavored smoke that enhances
the taste of the lamb without overpowering it. Mesquite chips can be
used also. Find wood chips for smoking at hardware or grocery stores.

2 Soak alder wood chips in water 1 to 24 hours. Drain well.

3 Trim fat from roast. Make 1/2-inch-deep slits into roast; place
garlic in slits. Combine wine and next 4 ingredients in a large
zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag. Add roast; seal bag, and marinate in
refrigerator 8 hours, turning bag occasionally. Remove roast from
bag, reserving marinade; set aside.

4 Prepare charcoal fire in meat smoker, and let burn 15 to 20 minutes.
Place alder chips on top of coals. Place water pan in smoker; add
reserved marinade and mint sprigs. Add hot tap water to fill pan.

5 Coat grill rack with cooking spray; place rack in smoker. Place
roast on rack; insert meat thermometer into thickest portion of
roast. Cover with smoker lid, and cook 3 hours or until meat
thermometer registers 140 deg (rare). Refill water pan with water,
and add additional charcoal to fire as needed.

6 Remove roast from smoker; let stand 10 minutes before serving.
Yield: 12 servings (serving size: 3 ounces lamb).
