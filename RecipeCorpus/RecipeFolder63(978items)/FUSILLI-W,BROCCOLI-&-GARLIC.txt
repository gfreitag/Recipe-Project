Title: FUSILLI W/BROCCOLI & GARLIC
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Broccoli flowerttes
1/3 c  Olive oil
6 c  Garlic; thinly sliced
Salt & pepper; to taste
Saute garlic in olive oil until JUST beginning to brown. DO NOT allow
garlic to brown. At the FIRST sight of browning the garlic is
finished. Any more cooking will make the garlic bitter. Add broccoli
& toss to coat, then add this mixture to the hot, drained pasta and
toss to mix completely. Season w/salt & pepper to taste.
