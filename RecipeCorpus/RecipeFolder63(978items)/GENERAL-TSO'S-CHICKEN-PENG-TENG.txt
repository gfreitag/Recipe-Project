-MICHAEKL KEAN VMXU03A
4    Chicken legs
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Distilled white vinegar
1 cl Garlic; minced
1 ts Ginger root; Peeled & minced
1 ts Cornstarch
1 lg Egg; beaten lightly
1/3 c  Corn oil
4    Dried hot chilis; seeded
Bone the chicken legs, including the thighs by scraping the meat from
the bone, working downward and keeping close to the bone. Pull the
meat down over the bone (pulling it inside out like a glove) and cut
it free from the bone. Discard the skin and cut the meat from each
leg into 6 pieces. In a bowl combine the soy sauce, vinegar, 1/2 c
water, the garlic and ginger root.

In another bowl, combine the egg and cornstarch and dip the chicken
pieces. Heat the oil in a wok or deep, heavy skillet until very hot,
add the chicken and fry it for 4 to 6 minutes, or until it is crisp.
Transfer the chicken with tongs to paper towels to drain and pour off
all but 1 T of the oil from the wok. Add the soy sauce mixture, the
chili peppers and the chicken and cook the mixture over moderately
high heat for 2 minutes, or until heated through.

Transfer it to a heated serving dish.
