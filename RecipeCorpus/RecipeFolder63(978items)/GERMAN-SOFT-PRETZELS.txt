Title: GERMAN SOFT PRETZELS
Categories: Breads, German
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
2 1/2    To 3 cups all purpose flour
2 tb Salad oil
1 tb Sugar
6 tb Baking soda in 6 cups water
Coarse salt
In a bowl , dissolve yeast in water.  Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour,the
oil,and sugar.  Beat for about 3 minutes to make a smooth batter.
Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn out onto a floured board and knead until smooth and satiny(about
5 minutes) adding flour as needed to prevent sticking. Place dough in
a greased bowl; turn over to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm
place until double(about 1 hour).

Punch down dough, turn out onto a floured board,and divide into 12
pieces. Shape each into a smooth ball by gently kneading. Then roll
each into a smooth rope about 18 inches long, and twist into a
pretzel shape. Place slightly apart on a greased baking sheet turning
loose ends underneath. Let rise, uncovered,until puffy(about 25
minutes) Meanwhile, in a 3-quart stainless steel or enameled pan(not
aluminum) bring soda water to a boil; adjust water to keep water
boiling gently. With a slotted spatula, lower 1 pretzel at a time
into pan. Let simmer for 10 seconds on each side,then lift from
water,drain briefly on spatula, and return to baking sheet. Let dry
briefly, then sprinkle with coarse salt and let stand,uncovered,
until all have simmered.

Bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until
golden brown.  Transfer to racks; serve warm with butter, mustard or
even cream cheese. Or let cool completely,wrap airtight,and freeze.
To reheat, place frozen on ungreased baking sheets and bake in a
preheated 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until hot. Makes 1
dozen pretzels.
