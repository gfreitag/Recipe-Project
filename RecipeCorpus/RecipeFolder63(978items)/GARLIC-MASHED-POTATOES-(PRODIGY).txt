Title: GARLIC MASHED POTATOES (PRODIGY)
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Med-size baking potatoes
2    Heads garlic
- broken up but not peeled
4 oz Unsalted butter
1 1/2 c  Milk
Salt to taste
Nutmeg to taste
4 tb Minced parsley
PEEL AND CUT POTATOES into quarters. Place in cold water in a
medium-size pan, bring to a boil and cook 15-to-20 minutes, until
tender. Meanwhile, plunge the garlic into boiling water and cook for
5 minutes. Drain, then peel when cool enough to handle. Place in a
small saute pan with half the butter over low heat for 10 minutes. Be
very careful not to let the garlic burn. Add 1 cup of milk, bring to
the boil and simmer 2 minutes. Puree in a blender or food mill, or
press through a sieve. Drain the potatoes well then put through a
potato ricer or food mill, or use a potato masher. (Do not use a food
processor, as it will make the potatoes gummy.) May be prepared up to
this point ahead of time, then reheated in a 325F oven for 20-to-30
minutes. Add more butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, 1/2 cup warmed milk
and seasonings to taste. Serve immediately for best flavor.
