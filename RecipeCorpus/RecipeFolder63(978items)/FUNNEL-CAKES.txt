Categories: Penndutch, Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 c  Unsifted flour
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1    Egg
3/4 c  Milk
(You need a metal funnel to make these delicious Pennsylvania Dutch
specialties. )

about 1 quart - Corn oil Confectioners sugar

Stir together first 5 ingredients. Mix egg and milk; add to flour
mixture. Stir until batter is smooth. Pour oil into skillet (no more
than 1/3 full). Heat to 375 degrees. An electric fry pan is excellent
for this. Holding forefinger over end of funnel, pour 1/4 cup into
funnel. Place over hot oil and remove finger to let batter flow. As
batter flows, move funnel in a circle to form a spiral cake. Fry,
turning once, 2 minutes or until golden brown. Drain and sprinkle
with sugar. Repeat. Makes enough for 6 funnel cakes.

Note: instead of the sugar, try drizzling with a thin icing and
sprinkle with chopped nuts.
