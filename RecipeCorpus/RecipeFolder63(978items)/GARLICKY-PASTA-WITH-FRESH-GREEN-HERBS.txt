Title: GARLICKY PASTA WITH FRESH GREEN HERBS
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Spaghetti
8 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
1/4 c  Basil, chopped
1/4 c  Chives, chopped
4 tb Sage, chopped
Salt & pepper
Cook spaghetti until *al dente*. Meanwhile, heat the garlic in the
olive oil until it smells fragrant, just a few moments. Toss in the
herbs & remove from the heat. Drain the pasta & toss in the pan with
the garlicky herbs.  Season & serve & do not add cheese as it only
interferes with the herby flavours. Be sure to add enough salt &
pepper, however. VARIATION: Omit the basil altogether. Replace the
sage with any of the following fresh herbs: marjoram; oregano; thyme;
rosemary or tarragon. Conversely, reduce the amount of sage & add a
little of all these herbs.
