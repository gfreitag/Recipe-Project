DIRECTIONS: In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the egg, oil,
and cornstarch. In a blender or food processor, or by hand, combine
the ingredients for Sauce 1. In a small bowl, combine the ingredients
for Sauce 2.  Place the measured ingredients beside the wok in the
order in which they are to be placed in the wok. Warm 2 serving
dishes, one lined with paper towel, in a 250=A1 oven. Fill the wok to
a depth of 1 1/2 to 2 inches with vegetable oil. Heat the oil to high
(400=A1), or until a day-old cube of bread browns in just under 1
minute. Heat another 4 minutes to stabilize the temperature.  Put the
chicken pieces into the oil one at a time until all are in. Stir-fry
3 minutes. Remove the pieces from the oil, draining well over the
wok, and keep warm in the oven on the paper-lined dish. Empty the oil
from the wok. Reduce the heat to medium (350=A1) and stir in Sauce 1.
As soon as it bubbles, stir in the chicken. Sprinkle Sauce 2 over the
chicken, stir-fry 1 minute more, then turn into the serving dish.
Scrape the sauce over the chicken and serve at once.
