This recipe is called garlic soup because it has so much garlic in it
but it is actually a very hearty soup with a very sweet garlic
flavor. It is well worth the time it takes to peel the garlic but you
must use fresh garlic do not replace with dried minced. Place 2 cups
of the water in a large stock pot. Add the whole garlic cloves and
cook over medium heat for 15 min. Remove the garlic cloves and mash
them thoroughly before processing. Blend in a food processor. Add the
remaining 2 1/2 qts water the barley and the wild rice. Bring to a
boil cover and simmer for 15 min. Add the remaining ingredients bring
to a boil turn down to simmer and cook until tender about 30-45 min.
This soup tastes best if made a day or two in advance to give the
flavors a chance to blend. Nutrition (per serving): 274 calories
