Title: GENERIC IMPOSSIBLE PIE
Categories: Casseroles
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/3 c  Milk
4    Eggs
5/8 c  Bisquick
1/2 ts Garlic salt
1/4 ts Pepper, black
1 ts Herbs
MMMMM-----------------------THINGS TO ADD----------------------------
1 c  Meat, cooked; chopped
1 1/2 c  Vegetables; bite-sized
1 c  Mushrooms; pieces
6    Onions, green; thinly sliced
1/2    Onions; chopped or rings
2    Bell peppers; rings/chopped
1 c  Cheese, shredded
Meat can be chicken, turkey, beef, ham, or even bacon. Vegetables can
be anything your family likes and you have in the freezer or garden:
green beans, corn, carrots, peas. If you use a watery vegetable such
as tomatoes or zucchini, be sure to drain well. Cheese can be
whatever will go well with the meat: ham and swiss, beef and cheddar,
chicken and monterey jack, garden vegetables and parmesan, shrimp or
crabmeat and almost anything. For a vegetable quiche, just use
vegetables and more cheese.

Preheat oven to 400.  Thaw and drain vegetables. Spray one foil pie
plate per 2 servings with nonstick spray. Mix meat, vegetables, and
cheese in pie plate. (If desired, reserve 1/8 c cheese per pie plate
to sprinkle on top for last 5 minutes of baking.)  Beat filling
ingredients until smooth (15 seconds in blender). Pour into plate(s).
Bake 20 minutes. Cool 5 minutes.

Sylvia's comments: this is a wonderful, flexible dinner pie. Great for
whatever leftovers you need to use up. I don't care what anyone says,
you can't fit 8 servings' worth into one pie plate.
