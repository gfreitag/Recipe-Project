Title: FRUITY SEAFOOD
Categories: Australian, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Butter
4    Shallots chopped
1    Green apple, peeled cored
-and diced
1 pn Dill
2 ts Mild curry powder
2 tb Plain flour
1 c  Apple juice
1 lb Scallops
1    Banana sliced
1/2 lb Green prawns in bite sized
-pieces
1/2 c  Cream
Salt to taste
Melt butter in saucepan, saute apple and shallots until soft. Add
curry powder and cook for a minute longer. Stir in flour, add apple
juice. Bring to boil, stirring constantly. Add salt and dill, simmer
for 5 minutes. Add prawns and scallops, cook until almost tender, add
banana 5 minutes before end of cooking time. Stir in cream, heat
through. Serve with fluffy or fragrant rice.

NB In this as in many recipes I use evaporated skim milk in lieu of
the cream, and thicken if necessary. Better for the arteries, with no
great compromise in taste or texture.
