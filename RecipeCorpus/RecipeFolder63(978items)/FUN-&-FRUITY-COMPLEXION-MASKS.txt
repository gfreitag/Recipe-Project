FACIAL RINSING LOTIONS or
FRESH FACIAL CREAM
** After using a mask, it's a good idea to follow up with either
FACIAL RINSING LOTIONS or FRESH FACIAL CREAM. 1. Peach Tightening
Mask: Whip peach and egg white together in a blender until smooth.
Gently pat mixture all over your face, relax 30 mins, then rinse off
with cool water. 2. Strawberry Drawing Mask: Mix strawberries and
cornstarch together to make a paste and apply to face, avoiding the
delicate area around your eyes. Leave on for 30 mins and rinse off
with cool water. 3. Apple Mask for Normal Skin: Srop apple into food
processor and chp. Add honey and sage and refrigerate 10 mins. Pat
mixture onto your face with a light tapping motion, tapping until
honey feels tacky. Leave on for 30 mins, rinse. 4. Cucumber Mask for
Oily Skin: Puree all and refrigerate 10 mins. Apply mixture to your
face and leave on 15 mins. Rinse with hot, then cool water. 5.
Blemished Skin Mask: Blend all until just combined. Apply to skin,
making sure the mixture is thick enough to stay on blemished areas:
cheeks, forehead, or chin. Add a bit more oatmeal to thicken the
mask, if necessary. Leave on 10 mins, then scrub off with a clean
washcloth dipped in warm water.
