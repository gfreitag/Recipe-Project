Title: GANG BA CURRY WITH MUSHROOMS
Categories: Side dish, Thai, Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
10 oz Straw mushrooms
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 1/2 tb Gang ba curry paste, see
-- recipe
2 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Sugar, optional
1/2 c  Oriental basil, chopped
2 ea Kaffir leaves
6 ea Red chili peppers, cut into
-- 4 or 5 pieces
If the mushrooms are very large, cut in half; however it is
traditional not to cut them in Thai cooking. Heat the oil in a wok
over medium heat. Add the curry paste & stir-fry until it releases
its aroma. Add 3 c water, mushrooms, soy sauce & sugar. Bring to a
boil, adjust the seasonings if necessary. Add the basil, kaffir &
chili peppers. Mix gently & serve hot with rice. NOTE: I make
variations of this adding a bunch assorted, cubed vegetables which I
stir-fry for a few moments before adding the water. Using the
vegetables gives a main dish rather than just a side dish. Good
vegetables in this curry are: eggplant, zucchini, corn, cauliflower,
bamboo shoots (I'm not sure how Thai this ingredient is though).
