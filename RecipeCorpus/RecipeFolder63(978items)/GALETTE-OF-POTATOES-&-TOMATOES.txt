This recipe has invariably proved to be very popular - and rightly
so. The combination of potato, celery and tomatoes, highlighted by
garlic and herbs, is a memorable one. Serve it either as a meal in
itself, with a salad, or as a side dish.

Saut the sliced onion in 2 tbs of the oil over a gentle heat for 5
minutes until it begins to brown lightly. Add the celery and cook for
a further 5 minutes. Remove from the pan.

Fry the sliced potatoes in 3 tbs more hot oil, adding more as needed,
shaking the pan until they begin to brown. Then lower the heat, cover
with a lid and cook for 5-10 minutes more until the potatoes are
tender. Season to taste.

Then stir in the tomatoes, garlic and herbs, along with the onion and
celery mixture, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring all the time. Put
into a heatproof dish and finish under a hot grill for 3-4 minutes.
