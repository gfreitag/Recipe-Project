MMMMM---------------------KLINGON ONION PIE--------------------------
1    Piecrust; for 9" pie
1/8 lb Bacon**
2 tb Margarine
1 1/4 lb Spanish onions
-coarsely chopped
3    Eggs
1 pt Sour cream
-salt and pepper
1/16 ts Nutmeg
**About a 1" cut right across a pound package of sliced bacon.
Line a 9" pie plate with the pie crust and flute the edges.
Cut the bacon into small bits and fry it until it is lightly
browned. Add the margarine, let it melt and then add the onion.
Stirring often, fry the onion with the bacon until the onion is soft
and golden. Remove from the heat and let cool while you mix the
custard part.
Put the eggs, sour cream, salt, pepper and nutmeg in a small bowl
and beat together with a whisk or eggbeater. Spread the cooked onions
and bacon in the pie plate. Pour the custard mixture over them. With
a spoon, even the contents of the pie pan out, if necessary. Bake at
375 for about 40 minutes, or until the custard is set and golden
brown and the crust is also browned. Cut the pie into 6 to 8 wedges
and serve hot.
