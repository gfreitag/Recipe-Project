"The batter for these pancakes needs to stand for about 4 hours (!
a.m.) before you start cooking. It helps if you have a flat pancake
griddle, but if you do not then use a heavy frypan and a good "bendy"
utensil to turn and lift the funkaso. They are similar to (although
smaller than) the Ethiopian injera which are made from a
millet-relative called teff and they can be served with Ethiopian
dishes such as the wars." 1. Sift flour into a bowl and gradually
pour in the warm water, stirring and mixing well as you do so to make
a smooth, runny paste. Set aside for 4 hours. 2. After this, heat the
margarine or oil in a shallow pan or griddle plate. While it is
warming. beat the batter with a spoon. 3. When the margarine or oil
is hot, ladle or pour enough batter in the pan to make a saucer-sized
pancake and cook until crsip. You can turn it once if you like but it
is not essential. Remove and keep warm. 4. Cook the others in the
same way and serve to accompany a main dish, or a snack with honey,
or chutney.
