I looked all through my Chinese books and the only one with a recipe
for Garlic Chicken was one by Martin Yan. I've never made this recipe
although I did have Garlic Chicken once in a restaurant and it was
excellent. Here's the recipe in Martin's own inimitable words... It
was once said in New York, "The only thing 50 cents will get you
these days is a seat on the subway." Garlic will get you a seat in no
time! Here's a power-packed dish that will remind you of your Italian
mother's cooking.

1.  Combine Chicken with garlic, wine, soy sauce, garlic salt and
sugar; marinate for 2 hours. 2. Add beaten eggs and flour to chicken
and mix well. 3. Heat oil in wok near smoke point. Reduce heat to
medium. Deep- fry chicken for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender.

NOTE: It doesn't say in the book, but the Garlic Chicken I had was
bone-in.
