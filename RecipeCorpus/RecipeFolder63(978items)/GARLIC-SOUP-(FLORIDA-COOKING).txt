Title: GARLIC SOUP (FLORIDA COOKING)
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/4 c  Chicken broth
2 ts Olive oil
1 sm Clove garlic or 1/2 large,-
-peeled and crushed
1 sl Cuban or French bread
1 ea Egg
Salt and freshly ground-
-pepper to taste
1 ts Minced parsley
2 ts Grated hard queso blanco-
-(see Note) or Parmesan-
-cheese
Bring the chicken broth to a boil.  In a small skillet, heat the oil.
Add the garlic and saute until golden and aromatic. Place the bread
in a large soup bowl, pour the oil and garlic over it, add the
boiling chicken broth, and immediately break the egg into the soup.
It will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.  Add salt and pepper, and sprinkle
with the parsley and cheese.

NOTE:  There are dozens of quesos blancos, or white cheeses, which is
exactly how the name translates. Some are soft, some fresh, but many
aged. Queso blanco generally is mild flavored, though some of the
aged ones can be quite tangy.  They are found in markets in Florida
and in most cities with colonies of residents of Caribbean, Cuban, or
Mexican ancestry. Try the cheeses, and choose the one that suits your
taste.
