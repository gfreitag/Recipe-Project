Title: GARLIC & ONION TOMATO SAUCE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 2 Servings
28 oz Plum tomatoes -- pureed
1/2 ts Ground thyme
1 ts Fresh basil -- minced
1    Garlic clove -- minced
1 sm Onion
Black pepper -- to taste
4 ts Olive oil
* Use plum tomatoes canned in tomato puree if available.

Chop onion; peel garlic and mince. In heavy skillet, place the olive
oil and heat over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; stir
occasionally and cook for 5-6 minutes until onion is tender. Drain
tomatoes through a sieve placed over a bowl. Add thyme, basil and
tomatoes to skillet. Use large spoon to crush tomatoes. Scrape the
puree from the sieve and add to the skillet. Do not use the remaining
tomato juice for this recipe. Bring the mixture to a simmer over
medium heat, stirring often. Continue to crush tomatoes with wooden
spoon. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes; sauce will thicken. Remove
from heat, add fresh ground black pepper to taste, salt also if you
wish. Serve this sauce with scrambled eggs, baked souffles, and
pasta, or refrigerate and use as needed by reheating slowly. Use in
recipes for cooked dried beans and in crockpot recipes using meats,
chicken or pasta.
