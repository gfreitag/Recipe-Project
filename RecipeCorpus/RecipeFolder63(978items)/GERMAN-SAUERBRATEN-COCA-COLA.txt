Categories: German, Beef
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Beef rump, sirloin tip, OR
Round bone chuck, boneless
1 1/2 c  Vinegar
1 c  COCA-COLA
3/4 c  Water
3    Onions, sliced
2    Stalks celery, sliced
2    Carrots, sliced

10    Whole cloves
3    Bay leaves
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt

3 tb Oil or shortening
MMMMM---------------------------GRAVY--------------------------------
3 c  Drippings plus strained
Marinade
5 tb Flour
5 tb Ginger snap crumbs
2 to 4 days before serving, wipe the meat with a damp cloth, then
place in a large plastic bag.

In a large bowl, throuoghly combine the vinegar, Coca-Cola, water,
onions, celery, carrots, pepper, cloves, bay leaves, sugar, and salt
and pour over meat.  Fasten bag tightly and lay flat in a 13x9-inch
pan. Refrigerate, turning bag each day. (If you like a sour
sauerbraten, let meat marinate 4 days.)

When ready to cook, remove meat (saving marinade) and dry well. Rub
the surface lightly with flour.  In Dutch oven, heat oil or
shortening and slowly brown the meat well on all sides. Add 1 cup of
the marinade liquid plus some of the vegetables and bay leaves. Cover
tightly and simmer on surface heat or in a preheat, 350Ã¸F oven for 3
to 4 hours until the meat is fork-tender.  If needed, add more
marinade during cooking to keep at least 1/2-inch liquid in the Dutch
oven. Remove the meat and keep warm until ready to slice.

Into a large measuring cup, strain the drippings.  Add several ice
cubes and let stand a few minutes until the fat separates out. Remove
fat, then make gravy. Makes 8 servings.

TO MAKE THE GRAVY:  In the Dutch oven, combine the gravy ingredients,
stir and cook about 5 minutes over medium heat until gravy is
thickened. Taste for seasonings. Makes 3 cups of gravy.
