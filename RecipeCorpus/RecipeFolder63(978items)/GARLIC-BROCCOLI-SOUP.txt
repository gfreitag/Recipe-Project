1 bn Broccoli
4 tb Butter, sweet

Drop unpeeled garlic cloves into boiling water for one minute (30
seconds for small cloves); remove from water, peel, and mince. Cut
broccoli into buds and stems, discarding woody portions. Cook in
boiling water until tender; remove and drain.  Melt butter in 2-quart
saucepan. When butter starts to bubble, add garlic, stirring rapidly
for a few seconds. Quickly add flour, salt, and pepper.  Stir
constantly for one minute. Add milk and broth, stirring briskly with
a wire whisk until sauce is thickened. In a blender or food
processor, puree broccoli with a little sauce, adding remaining sauce
until all of broccoli is blended. Correct seasonings to taste and
thin with half-and- half to the desired consistency. Serve sprinkled
with Hungarian sweet paprika.

NOTE:  This rich and creamy soup has excellent garlic flavor.
It is better the second day and may be served cold as well as hot.
Add a little half-and-half the next day just before serving.
