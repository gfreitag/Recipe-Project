1 ea Egg white
1 tb Cornstarch

Place chicken breasts in freezer for 1-2 hours or until very firm but
not frozen solid.  Slice crosswise into thin shreds. In bowl, lightly
beat egg white, then mix in 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 1 tablespoon
wine, stirring until cornstarch is dissolved.  Add chicken and mix
well to coat all pieces.  Let stand at room temperature for 30
minutes.

Meanwhile, slice green onions on the diagonal into very thin slices.
Mince ginger root and garlic. Combine SAUCE ingredients, mixing well.
Heat wok, add oil, and stir-fry chicken until no longer pink. Remove
chicken with a slotted spoon.  Add onions, ginger and garlic to wok
and stir-fry about 30 seconds, until ginger and garlic are fragrant,
but not brown.

Return chicken to wok, re-stir sauce ingredients and add to wok. Cook,
stirring constantly, until mixture is well combined, hot and bubbly
and thickened slightly. Serve over hot, cooked rice.
