until the spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove the lid and cook
until the excess liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in the
basil and Tofu "Cheese" Sauce.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a baking sheet and dust
with cornmeal.

Flour your hands and a rolling pin. Turn the pizza dough out onto a
floured work surface andpunch down.
Divide the dough into four pieces and shape each one into a ball.
Roll each ball into a 10-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick.

Divide the vegetable filling evenly among the dough circles, placing
it in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough circles in half
over the filling. Roll up the edges to form a 1-inch-thick border on
each calzone, and flute. Carefully transfer the calzones to the
baking sheet.

Bake until lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes. Servehot or at room
temperature.
