Title: FUDGE TRUFFLE CHEESECAKE -1
Categories: Cheesecakes
Yield: 1 Servings
Crust-----
1 1/2 c  Chocolate Cookie Crumbs
4 tb Unsalted Butter -- melted
3 tb Granulated Sugar
Filling-----
24 oz Cream Cheese -- softened
1 c  Granulated Sugar
3 lg Eggs
8    Semisweet Chocolate Squares
Melted & slightly co
1 ts Vanilla Extract
Heat oven to 325 degrees.  Line the bottom of your springform pan with
waxed paper (or do whatever you normally do to keep it from sticking.)

For the crust, mix the oreos, melted butter, and sugar in a bowl.
Press the mixture onto the bottom of your pan.

For the filling, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until
blended. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition just
until blended. Stir in the chocolate.

Pour the filling into the crust and bake for 60-65 minutes or until
center is almost set.

Note:  I always put a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake --
helps keep the oven moist so the cheesecake is less likely to crack.
