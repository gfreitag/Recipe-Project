Melt butter in a small saucepan.  Add garlic powder and mix well.
Heat oil in a 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 quart pot over medium high heat for 20
seconds. Add popcorn kernals. Stir until all kernels are coated with
oil. Cover pot. As soon as the first kernel pops, shake, continuously
until all kernels have popped.  Remove from heat and empty popper
kernels into a large bowl. Add melted garlic butter and toss.
VARIATION:  For a special treat, flavor popped kernels with 3/4 cup
finely grated cheddar cheese and place in a preheated 325~ oven for 6
minutes.
Either of these popcorns should be served immediately for best
flavor.
