Title: Protein Pancakes
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Baking Soda
1 1/2 c  Milk (or more)
2 x  Eggs
3 tb Plain Yogurt
2 tb Light Sesame Oil
1 1/2 c  Unbleached (wheat) Flour
1/2 c  Bran
1/4 c  Rolled Oats  *
1/4 c  Soy Flour(in health stores)
1 ts Baking powder
*  ground in blender, or 1/4 c Cornmeal The addition of soy flour or powder
to these pancakes boosts the protein content.
Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Beat the liquid ingredients (incl 2 T
of the oil) together and add them to the dry mixture. Stir to mix well,
mashing out the lumps with a wooden spoon. Add more liquid if necessary;
the batter should pour off the spoon slowly but smoothly. You can use water
instead of milk after you've added the first 1 1/2 cups of milk. Brush a
hot skillet with oil or butter. The skillet should be well greased. Heat
the skillet and cook the pancakes on the 1st side over med-hi heat until
the surface bubbles; turn and cook briefly on the 2nd side. Transfer to
warm plate.  Makes 12 pancakes.
