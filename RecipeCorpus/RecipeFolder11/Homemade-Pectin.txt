Title: Homemade Pectin
Categories: Preserve
Yield: 1 servings
(do not core or peel)
2 c  Water for each pound of
Apples
Underripe Granny Smiths,
Pippins, green apples;
Washed and cut into eighths
Place the apples and water in a large stockpot or soup kettle, cover, and
bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes or until apples are
tender.  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

Pour the pulp and juice through a jelly bag or line a large bowl with
dampened cheesecloth, pour the pulp and juice through, gather the corners
of the cheesecloth, and tie in a knot.  Suspend from a cabinet knob or
handle and allow to drip into a bowl overnight.

The next day, measure the apple juice and pour into a large pot.  Bring to
a boil voer high heat and cook until reduced by half.  Refrigerate and use
within 4 days or pour into containers and freeze for up to 6 months.

An easy way to determine reduction is to measure the depth of the liquid in
the pan with a plastic ruler before boiling.  Re-measure as liquid reduces.
No need to pour into measuring cup!
