Thoroughly scrub and clean a good oak barrel. Put as much good fresh-killed
beef as desired to be corned in barrel and cover with cold water. Have the
water 2 inches above the meat. Let stand for 48 hours. Drain off the water
and measure before discarding. Measure the same amount of cold water
(spring water, if possible) and to every gallon of water used, add the
above proportions of salt, sugar and salt peter. Boil for 15 minutes and
then skim. When cold, pour over the beef. Place a heavy weight on meat to
keep it under brine. Store in a cool cellar.
