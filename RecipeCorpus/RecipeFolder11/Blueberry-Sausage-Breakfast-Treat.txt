Title: Blueberry Sausage Breakfast Treat
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Sugar, brown
2    Eggs
8 oz Sour cream
1 c  Blueberries
1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
3/4 lb Sausage, pork
2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
Day before: Cook sausage and drain well.  Stir together flour, baking
powder, and baking soda.  In large mixing bowl, beat butter until fluffy.
Add sugars and beat until well-blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating
well after each.  Alternate adding flour mixture and sour cream to creamed
ingredients; mix well. Fold in sausage and berries. Pour batter into
ungreased 13"x9"x2" baking pan.  Sprinkle pecans on top. Refrigerate
overnight.

Preheat oven to 350.  Bake 35-40 minutes, until done. Cool on wire rack.

Sylvia's notes:  With two young kids, I didn't want to use chopped nuts, so
I sprinkled raw oats on top. Then, I didn't have a 13"x9" pan, so used two
8"x3-3/4" pans.  And my oven was broken so I used my toaster oven and baked
one pan 35 minutes at 350.  The batter is so thick it's very hard to work
with; I need to add more liquid next time. It's also too rich to bake
easily, think I'll replace some sour cream with water or milk.
