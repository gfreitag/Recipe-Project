Title: Rice with Red Beans (Korean Pat Bab)
Categories: Korean, Rice/grains
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Round red beans
1/2 c  Rice
1.  Quickly wash the red beans in cold water. Rinse the rice.

2.  Bring the red beans to a boil in 2 cups water, then simmer for 20
minutes over a low flame. Add the rice and cook for 20 more minutes or
until dry.

Variation: For a less pronounced red bean taste, bring a dozen red beans to
a boil in 2 cups water. Then simmer for 20 minutes. Add slightly less than
2 cups rice, boil a second time, then steam until dry.
