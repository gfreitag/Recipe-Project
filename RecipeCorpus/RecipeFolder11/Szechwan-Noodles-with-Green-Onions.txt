Categories: Chinese, Pasta
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Hot chili oil (or to taste)
6    Green onions, sliced finely
- on the bias, divided
Black sesame seeds, optional
Fresh cilantro, oprional
1/4 c  BBQ pork, optional
1 lb Chinese noodles (not canned)
3 1/2 tb Dark brown sesame oil
3 1/2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Rice vinegar
2 tb Granulated sugar (or to
- taste)
Bring a generous amount of unsalted water to a boil. Add the noodles (all
at once) for approximately 2 minutes, or until al dente (toothy but firm).
Use chopsticks or two wooden spoons to separate noodles as they cook. Do
not overcook.

Empty noodles into a large colander, then immediately flush with cold
running water until cool.  Shake off excess water and drain for 15 to 30
minutes.

Combine sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and chili oil; mix well. Pour
over noodles and use your hands to evenly distribute seasoned sauce. Work
carefully so noodles don[t break.  Gently spread sauce over each strand and
allow the noodles to fully absorb sauce before eating.

Add all onions except 2 tablespoons.  Toss and mix to evenly distribute the
onions.  Garnish with remaining onions, sesame seeds and cilantro, if
desired.

Noodles taste best if they are allowed to sit and the flavors meld for a
few hours before serving.

Serve refrigerated and cold, or at room temperature.
