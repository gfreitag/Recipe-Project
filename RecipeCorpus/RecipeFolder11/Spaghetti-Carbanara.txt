Title: Spaghetti Carbanara
Categories: Italian, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
1 sm Clove garlic crushed
2 tb Bacon fat fom above
1 lb Bacon cooked and crumbled
1 md Onion, diced
1    Green pepper, diced
-----------------------------------PASTA-----------------------------------
2    Eggs
2 tb Water
2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
2 ts Olive oil
Saute the onion and pepper. Cook pasta and drain. Add pepper, onion and
bacon Add 2 eggs and stir over med heat until egg starts to cook. You don't
want the eggs to become scrambled. It should be on the creamy side. Add
pepper and parmesan to taste. PASTA: Mix the flour, salt and olive oil,
then beat in the eggs, (a food processor, or a mixmaster does this very
easily).  When well combined, add all of the water. Work until this becomes
a dough ball, and then knead for two minutes, stretching out the dough, and
folding it. Put in a plastic bag, and store in the fridge for at least a
half an hour. Divide the dough into four pieces, and run through the
machine, adding flour (this is a good place to work in some semolina) so
that the dough is not sticky. After kneading on the widest setting for
about 10/15 passes, reduce the size of the roller one step at a time until
you reach the thinnest size. Put through the cutter of your choice, and dry
on a rack or a line. Use fresh, or freeze unused portions. Easy, and quick
and impresses the hell out of your guests! I sometimes add thyme, or
oregano to my dough when mixing (about 2 t) and this adds nicely to the
taste of the dough.
