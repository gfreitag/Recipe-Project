Title: Tabasco Classic - Hot Pepper Jelly ****
Categories: Preserve
Yield: 6 jars- 8 oz
3/4 c  Cider Vinegar
3 1/2 c  Sugar
3 oz Pouch Of Fruit Pectin
4 lg Red Or Green Peppers, Cored
- And Seeded
1 1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
We generally make our pepper jelly with aged Tabasco pepper mash from the
factory to give it color and flavor.  Although perhaps not quite as fiery,
this simple recipe using the pepper sauce makes a mellow, spicy jelly.
Spread cream cheese on crackers, then top with a dollop of the jelly for a
tempting morsel to serve with cocktails.  Pectin is available in
well-stocked supermarkets.

Cut the peppers into large pieces, then coarsely chop in a food processor
or blender.  In a large non aluminum saucepan over high heat, combine the
peppers, Tabasco sauce, vinegar, and sugar.  Bring to a boil and boil
rapidly for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and
stir in the pectin.  Return the pan to the heat and return to a boil. Boil
the jelly for exactly 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Stirring
frequently to prevent bits of pepper from rising to the surface, skim the
foam off the top.  Ladle the jelly into hot sterilized jars, seal, and
place on a rack in a deep kettle. Pour boiling water over the jars to cover
by 2 inches and bring to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil for 10
minutes, then remove to a rack to cool. Makes six 8-ounce jars.
