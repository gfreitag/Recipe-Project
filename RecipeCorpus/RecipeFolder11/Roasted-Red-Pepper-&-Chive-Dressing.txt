Roasted Red Pepper and Chive Dressing Hold red pepper over a flame, turning
it until evenly charred. Or cut it in half, rub with oil, and place under
the broiler until blackened. Wrap in a plastic bag and set aside to cool.
Scrape off the burned skin and remove seeds and stem. In bowl of blender or
food processor fitted with a steel blade, place red pepper, vinegar, and
garlic. Process until pepper is pureed. With machine running, slowly
drizzle

This recipe, featured at Neiman-Marcus, is from caterer George Dolese.
George serves this dressing over a salad of fusili pasta, chunks of fresh
mozzarella, julienned zucchini and prosciutto, sliced smoked chicken, and
blanched asparagus.
