Categories: Misc., Chili, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Cumin seed
2 c  Hot water
6 ts Chili powder
1 1/2 c  Canned whole tomato
2 ds Liquid hot pepper sauce
Salt to taste
4 lb Venison, bite size
- Chili grind fine  *OR*
Chuck, well trimmed, ground
1 lg Onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 ts Oregano
Place meat, onion and garlic in a large heavy skillet or Dutch oven. Cook
until light colored. Add oregano, cumin, water, chili powder, tomatoes, hot
pepper sauce (more or less to taste), and salt. Bring to a boil, lowering
heat, and simmer for one hour. Skim off fat during cooking. AUTHOR'S NOTE:
Even more fat can be removed if chili is stored in refrigerator, allowing
fat to rise to the top and solidify, when it can be easily removed. LBJ
preferred venison in his chili, and so did his doctor, because it is so
lean and fat-free. Ground beef heart is leaner still, and has a rich beef
flavor with the added value of high Vit B content. This recipe was tailored
to President Johnson after his first heart attack. Not only is it
relatively fat-free, it calls for lean venison, when available.The local
pronunciation of Pedernales is Purd-in-alice, and in this case local
extends at least from Texas to Washington,D.C., to New York City. FROM: The
