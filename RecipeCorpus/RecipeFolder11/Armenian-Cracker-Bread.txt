Title: Armenian Cracker Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 c  Whole wheat flour
Toasted sesame seeds
1 pk Dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1 ts Salt
Sprinkle yeast into warm water in large bowl and stir until dissolved. Add
salt. Combine all-purpose and whole wheat flours and add enough to yeast
mixture to make stiff dough. Turn out on floured surface and knead until
smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Shape into ball. Place in greased bowl
and turn to grease top. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1
1/2 hours. Punch down and let rise again until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Divide dough into 8 pieces and roll each out on lightly floured surface to
very thin circle about 9 inches in diameter. Place, one at a time, on
baking sheet and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake at 400F 5 to 6 minutes,
or until bread appears dry, lightly browned and blistered. Run palest side
under hot broiler until lightly browned. Cool and store in dry place.
