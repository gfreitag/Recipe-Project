Categories: Cookies
Yield: 32 servings
-------------------------------FOR THE DOUGH-------------------------------
2 c  Flour; all purpose
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
8 oz Cream cheese; softened
-----------------------------RAISIN NUT FILLING-----------------------------
1 c  Almonds;ground/or other nuts
1/4 c  Sugar; for topping
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Seedless raisins;or currants
1 ts Cinnamon
---------------------------STRAWBERRY JAM FILLING---------------------------
1/4 c  Sugar; for topping
1/2 c  Almonds; ground
1/2 c  Strawberry jam;or other jam
Cream the butter and cream cheese together. Beat in the flour, a little at
a time. Knead the dough lightly until all the flour is incorporated.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Divide the dough into two portions. Prepare
one of the fillings by combining the ingredients except the sugar for the
topping, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Roll out a portion
of the dough in a circle about 1/16" thick. With a knife or pastry wheel,
cut the pastry into 16 pie-shaped wedges. If the dough is sticky, dust it
with a little flour. Sprinkle or spread the filling on the wedge. Beginning
at the wide edge, roll the dough up toward the point. Place on an ungreased
cookie sheet and carefully sprinkle with a tiny bit of the reserved sugar.
Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Bake 15 to 18 minutes, or
until golden Notes: The dough for this cookie will literally melt in your
hands if not worked very quickly, and kept as cold as possible! I freeze a
marble pastry board before I begin to make these and use a marble pin for
rolling the dough. If you do not have this equipment, ice down the area you
aare going to work on. When rolling the dough, it is wise to place a sheet
of waxed paper over the board. If the dough gets too sticky to work, put it
back in the fridge for a while, then continue. This recipe is basically the
recipe in The Jewish Holiday Kitchen, by Joan Nathan. I have used various
flavors of jam or preserves, even Simply Fruit in it, and the cookies
disappear like magic. If I bake them for guests, I make at least two
recipes, or my sweet-tooth husband will eat them all before the company
arrives. (and I help him! <G>) Barb Day
