Title: Pierre Franey's Potato Pancakes
Categories: Vegetables, Breakfast
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
1/2 ts Minced garlic
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
Freshly ground pepper to
Taste
2 tb Vegetable oil
3    Potatoes (about 1.25 lbs)
Salt to taste
1 tb Butter
1/3 c  Half-and-half
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 c  Flour
Put the potatoes in a saucepan and add cold water to cover and salt. Bring
to the boil and cook until tender, 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain and peel the
potatoes and put them through a food mill or potato ricer.

In a mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, butter, half-and-half, eggs,
flour, onion, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper.  Blend well.

Heat the oil in a skillet, preferably nonstick.  Spoon potato mixture into
mounds and flatten to make patty shape.  Cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until
golden brown on one side.  Turn and cook 3-4 minutes on the second side, or
until golden brown.  Do not overcook or pancakes will be dry to the taste.
Serve hot.
