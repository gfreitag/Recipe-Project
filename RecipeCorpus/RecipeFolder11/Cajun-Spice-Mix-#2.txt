Spice is great on most all meats; including pork chops and steaks; chicken
and seafoods.  The food to be blackened should be moistened on both sides
with butter or margarine.  Then coated with the spice mix.  The coated meat
should then be cooked in a white hot cast iron skillet on both sides until
degree of wellness is reached and spice looks like a black crust.  Shrimp
should be peeled, leaving only the tails on.  Foods my also be cooked on
very hot grill.  Always cook in well ventilated area, as mixture may smoke
alot.  Amount of coating is to taste.  This is a very spicy mix.  Start
lite and work your way up.

Blackened shrimp makes for great appetizer along with a good cocktail
sauce.  Shrimp need to be attened continually while cooking as it only
requires a couple minutes each side.
