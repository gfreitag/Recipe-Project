Title: Sugared Walnuts
Categories: Chinese, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Peanut oil
2 c  Walnut halves, raw
1 tb Sugar
Blanch walnut halves for 30 seconds; drain.  While still slightly damp,
dredge nuts in sugar.  Spread them out to dry. Heat oil in wok to about 200
degrees, or until a test walnut browns in about 30 seconds. If walnut is
too dark, oil is too hot. Deep-fry nuts, 1/2 cup at a time. Sugar will melt
and form a thin, hard outer shell. Cool and cover until ready to serve.
