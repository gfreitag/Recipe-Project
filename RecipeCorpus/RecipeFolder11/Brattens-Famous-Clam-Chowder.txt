Drain Juice from clams and pour over onions, celery, and potatoes.  Add
enough water to barely cover.  Cook vegetables.  Meanwhile, melt butter,
add flour and blend until smooth.  Stirring constantly, add milk and cook

vinegar to vegetable mixture and heat through until thick.  Serve hot.

[My variations: Add 3 cans of clams (and juice) instead of 2, also use
about 4-6 C. potatoes, 3 T. Red wine vinegar. Goes just a little further.]

Comes from a restraunt that used to be located here in the valley.  We
would go there on special occasions.
