The food processor method is terrific for those of us who bake frequently.
Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in sugar, salt, rosemary,
oregano, 2 cups of the flour and the oil. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough
remaining flour to make dough easy to handle (dough will be soft). Turn
dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead about 5 minutes until smooth and
elastic.Place dough in greased medium bowl and turn greased side up. Cover
and let rise in warm place 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until double. (Longer rising
gives typical French bread texture.)Grease large cookie sheet and sprinkle
with cornmeal. Divide dough into 24 equal parts. Roll and shape each part
into rope, about 9 inches long, sprinkling with flour if dough is too
sticky. Place on cookie sheet. Mix egg white and 2 tablespoons cold water.
Brush over breadsticks. Sprinkle  with poppy seed. Heat oven to 400
degrees. Bake about 20 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown and
crisp. Immediately remove from cookie sheets. Store loosely covered. 2
