*This dish originally used 1 lb. of flank steak which was cut against the
grain into thin slices and then marinated same as the tofu. Sometimes I
make it with steak or tofu or a mixture of both. In addition, I
occasionally add a small bok choy which is first blanched and then cooled.
If other vegetables are added, increase the cornstarch mixture to three
times what is listed. Recipe can be doubled and comes out fine. Mix the
cornstarch with the soup stock and have ready until needed. Get tofu ready
according to your favorite methods. I usually slice it lengthwise in
half-inch blocks, put paper towels over and under it, and press with
telephone book to get out excess water. I also like to use tofu after it
has been frozen. Mix together the sherry, salt, pepper, soy sauce, sugar
and 1 1/2 tsp. of the oil in a shallow dish. Add the tofu or steak shreds
and leave to marinate for 15 minutes. Heat 2 1/2 tablespoons of the
remaining oil in a wok or pan over high heat. Add the ginger and onion and
stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes (about). Remove onions, place in a colander, and
let drain. You can use the oil left in pan if it is enough. Heat wok again.
When it is very hot, add the tofu or steak and garlic. Stir-fry the tofu or
steak and garlic in the oil for until brown. Mix in the onion and ginger
and stir-fry for a minute. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and cook,
stirring for about 30 seconds or until thickened. From "The Encyclopaedia
of Chinese Cooking". Enjoy! ~Karen- cookin' in Brick, NJ 05/05 08:38 pm
