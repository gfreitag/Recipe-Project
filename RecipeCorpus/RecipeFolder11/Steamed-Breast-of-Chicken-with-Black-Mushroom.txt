Title: Steamed Breast of Chicken with Black Mushroom
Categories: Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 2 servings
8    Water chestnuts
1    Chinese sausage (opt)
1 lg Chicken breast
8    Dried Nami black mushrooms
2    Green onions
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
2 tb Thin soy sauce
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 ts Sugar
2 tb Dry sherry
1 tb Cornstarch
2    Slices ginger root/minced
1 ts Sesame oil
Preparation:  Soak dried mushrooms in hot water for 1/2 hour or until soft.
Remove stems; thinly slice caps. Debone chicken; slice into 1/2" thick,
quarter-size coins; place pieces in shallow, heat-proof dish. Add marinade
ingredients to chicken; marinate for at least 30 minutes. Slice water
chestnuts in thin circles.  Cut green onions on bias into 1" sections.

There are 2 varieties of "Cantonese-style" Chinese semi-dried sausage
available in Chinese markets: duck liver & sweet pork meat. Either will do
for this dish. Cut sausage on bias into 1/8" thick slices. Marinade is not
used with sausage.

Steaming:  Mix sliced mushrooms & water chestnuts with chicken. If desired,
add sausage. Steam for 20 minutes. If using deep bowl, stir chicken after
10 minutes to make certain bottom pieces get cooked. Just before serving,
add green onions. Serve immediately, since cornstarch will become gummy if
dish is allowed to cool.

HINT: If using metal steamer, stretch dish towel under steamer cover, to
prevent build-up of condensed steam in dish.
