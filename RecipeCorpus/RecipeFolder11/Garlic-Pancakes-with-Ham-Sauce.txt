Title: Garlic Pancakes with Ham Sauce
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Oil
3 1/2 c  Milk
9    Large cloves fresh garlic,
-minced
1 lb Lean ham, minced
1/2 lb Butter
3 tb Rubbed sage
3    Large heads fresh garlic
2 c  Self rising flour
2    Eggs
Mix together 12 tablespoons (1-1/2 sticks) butter and sage; reserve. Remove
as much outer skin from garlic as possible without piercing the cloves'
covering. Set garlic in saucepan, cover with water and boil gently about 45
minutes or until cloves are quite soft. Remove from heat. When cool enough
to handle squeeze each clove to remove cooked garlic by grasping clove at
tip and pulling down toward base. In mixing bowl, beat garlic with fork
until smooth. Add to garlic same amount (at least one cup) flour, eggs, oil
and 1-1/2 cups milk to make pancake batter. Add minced garlic to batter and
set aside. Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter and keep warm. While waiting
for batter to work, place half the sage butter (6 tb) in saucepan, add 6 tb
flour to make a roux and cook at medium temperature, stirring frequently,
to brown. Meanwhile in skillet, place remaining 2 tb of remaining sage
butter and add ham. Heat thru, but do not burn. When roux is nicely
browned, add remaining 2 cups milk. Allow to thicken, stirring frequently.
Add ham and skillet drippings and mix to make ham sauce. Keep warm. Heat
griddle or clean skillet and grease lightly with a bit of remaining sage
butter. Drop batter by spoonfuls onto griddle to make silver dollar-sized
pancakes. Serve with melted butter and ham sauce. Makes 2 dozen pancakes.

Cooking the garlic until it is soft changes its flavor from pungent to
sweet and nut-like -- a very good addition to pancakes and a pleasant
compliment to the smokiness of the ham sauce. Serve for breakfast, brunch,
lunch or even a light supper.
