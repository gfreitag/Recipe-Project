Brown the venison (or other wild game) with some butter.  Venison tends to
be somewhat dry, so add butter as needed.  Drain well.  Add to 6-8 quart
slow cooker.  (A large pot on the stove will work, but overnight cooking is
preferred).  Add other ingredients, mixing well.  Add only enough water to
prevent burning.  Cook covered for 2 hours at boil.  Reduce heat to ~200
degrees and cook until you can't keep everyone away.  Consistancy should be
fairly thick.  Cook uncovered if too thin.

Top with shredded cheese of choice and serve with fresh cornbread.

Freezes well if any left over.
