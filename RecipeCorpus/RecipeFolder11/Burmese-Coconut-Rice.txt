Title: Burmese Coconut Rice
Categories: Mideast, Rice/grains
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Peanut Oil
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Extra Coconut Milk
3 3/4 c  Milk
1 lb Fresh Shredded Coconut
3 1/2 c  Long Grain Rice
3 md Onions, Grated
Bring the milk to a boil and add the shredded coconut.  Remove form the
heat and let it stand, covered, for 1 hour.  Mix the rice and onions and
fry together in the heated oil for about 3 minutes.  Add this mixture to
the milk and coconut and add the salt.  Mix well and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat, cover, and let simmer over low heat for 30 minutes, or
until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid.  If the mixture becomes too
dry before the rice is soft, add a little of the extra coconut milk; heat
the milk before adding, but do not let it boil.
