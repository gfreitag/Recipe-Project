Title: Quick Onion Tarka
Categories: Spices/etc.
Yield: 1 servings
6 oz Dried Onion Flakes
8 tb Cooking Oil
Onion Tarka is the traditional crispy brown onion garnish sprinkled over
many Indian dishes. This is a quick version that will keep in an airtight
container for several weeks.

1. Heat the oil, then add the onion flakes. 2. Briskly stir-fry for about 1
minute. They will burn easily so keep them moving. 3. Remove from heat and
drain. Serve hot or cold.
