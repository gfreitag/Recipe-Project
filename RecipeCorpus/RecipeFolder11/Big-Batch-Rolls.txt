warm water in a LARGE mixing bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Add dry milk powder

one portion of dough at a time, place dough on a lightly floured surface;
knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour, if necessary. Roll dough
to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut dough with a 2-1/2-inch round cutter.
Make a crease with dull edge of knife just off center on each round. Brush
lightly with melted butter.
Fold larger side over smaller so that the edges will meet. Seal. Place 15
rolls in a lightly greased 8-inch square baking pan. Repeat procedure
filling two additional 8-inch square pans.
Repeat procedure with remaining portion of dough, filling 3 additional
square pans.  (NOTE: When I made these rolls, I used a total of 7 toaster
oven size pans, each holding about 2 dozen rolls) Cover and let rise in a
warm place, (85F), free from drafts, 40 minutes or until rolls are doubled
in bulk. Bake at 375F. for 10--15 minutes. NOTE: To Freeze, prepare and
bake rolls as directed; let cool.  Wrap in tin foil; freeze. To serve, let
rolls thaw; then bake in foil at 375F. degrees or until thoroughly heated.
