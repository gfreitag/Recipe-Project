Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Oil for frying
1    Medium potato, grated (1 cup
1/4 c  Resh horseradish; grated
1/4 c  Nion; grated
Wring out grated potato to remove as much water as possible by scooping
about 1/4 cup of potato into your hand; squeeze firmly. Place potato flesh
in medium size bowl. Add remaining ingredients to grated potato; mix until
well blended. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet until it is almost
smoking. Pat 2 tablespoons of grated potato mixture into a flat disk about
2-inches in diameter. Repeat, leaving about 1 inch between pancakes. Cook
until bottom is browned and beginning to char, about 2 minutes. Turn; cook
until second side begins to char, about 2 minutes. Remove to warm plate.
Repeat with remaining grated potato mixture. Serve hot or warm, accompanied
by apple sauce. Adapted from Alan Harding, Nosmo King, New York Potato
pancakes with a horseradish punch are great way to work spring into your
menu. Fans of the tear-inducing fumes that rise from freshly grated
horseradish can tell you how they clear your head. What a culinary way to
drive out wintery thoughts as we move into the new season! Fresh
horseradish is rich in vitamin C and volatile oils. These oils are the
cause of its pungent bite. This bite gives an interesting flavor-lift to
potato pancakes. Alan Harding, chef at Nosmo King restaurant in New York,
is serving spring latkes, or pancakes, made from a blend of grated celery
root, potato, horseradish and onion. Since both celery root and horseradish
are bitter, I find that using 1 or the other makes pancakes with more
balanced flavor. Also, their texture is more velvety. Harding serves his
crunchy, fried latkes on top of a crisp green salad. It's a nice change
from croutons. They also make a zesty accompaniment to roast leg of spring
lamb or roast beef.
