Contributed to the echo by: Stephen Ceideburg Originally from: "Discover
Thai Cooking".Pierre Chaslin, Piyatep Canungmai, Luca Invernizzi Tettoni,
Times Editions, Singapore, 1987 Here's the recipe for the paste if you want
to go to the effort: Yellow Curry Paste Place the cumin and coriander seeds
in a pan without adding any oil. Dry fry them, stirring, over medium heat
for 1 to 2 minutes until they are slightly browned, and give off a roasted
aroma.

Coarsely chop the chilies and soak in water for 10 minutes. Drain. Pound
all the ingredients together to produce a fine paste which goes well with
beef and pork.

You can work out your frustrations pounding the spice mix in a mortar and
pestle or you can use a food processor if you're feeling particularly
harmonious... Make a lot of the paste and save it for use in other curries.
