Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Fresh ginger juice
1/4 ts Sesame oil
Cornstarch
3 c  Frying oil
4 c  Chicken broth
Salt and pepper to taste
Cornstarch paste
4    Sq. fresh hard beancurd
1/2 lb Ground pork, unseasoned
4    Dried Nami black mushrooms
1/2 c  Fresh shelled peas
2 ts Thin soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1    Clove garlic, minced
1    Green onion, minced
Wash and soak mushrooms in warm water for 30 minutes. Combine ground pork,
soy sauce, sherry, garlic, onion, ginger juice and sesame oil. Cover and
set aside.

Slowly heat deep-frying oil in wok; oil is hot enough when vigorous bubbles
come up around a bamboo chopstick stood vertically in oil. Deep-fry
beancurd squares until brown; drain.

Cut beancurd squares in half diagonally.  Use paring knife and spoon to
make hollow pocket in beancurd. Fill pocket with a tablespoon or so of meat
mixture; dredge meat face with cornstarch. Deep-fry each piece until face
is brown and crusty; drain.

Combine chicken broth, stuffed deep-fried beancurd, whole mushrooms and
peas in clay pot. Bring to boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 10
minutes. Uncover, return to boil, and thicken soup slightly with cornstarch
paste. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
