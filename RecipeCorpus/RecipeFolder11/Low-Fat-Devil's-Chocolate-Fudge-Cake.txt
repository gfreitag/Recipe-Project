Categories: Low-cal
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Plus 2 tb sugar
3/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Prune puree (see note below)
-or prepared prune butter
3 lg Egg whites

1 c  Plus 2 tb flour
Preheat oven to 350^.  Coat a 9" square pan with cooking spray.

In a mixer bowl, combine water, prune puree, egg whites and vanilla. Beat
thoroughly to blend. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking
soda and salt.  Beat dry ingredients into liquid mixture. Spread batter
into prepared pan.  Bake about 30 minutes, or until cake tests done.  Cool
on rack in pan.  Serve dusted with powdered sugar or with the following
icing.

NOTE:  To prepare prune puree, simmer 1/2 c prunes in water to cover for
about 10 minutes.  Let stand until cool.  Drain well. Force the prunes
through a sieve, leaving behind the skin particles and seeds.

ICING:  Combine 2 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1/4 c cocoa and 1/4 c low fat milk.
Spread on cooled cake.

This recipe for all of you healthy chocolate freaks. Note at the bottom,
there is a method for making prune puree (very similar to the WonderSlim
product that no one can find).  This recipe comes from an article about
fruit, since it uses prune puree instead of fat. My one gripe, about which
I have written to the paper, is that they do NOT do a nutritional analysis
of a recipe, even though they call it low-fat.  However, those of us who
are experienced in baking low-fat can see that there is little fat in this
cake.
