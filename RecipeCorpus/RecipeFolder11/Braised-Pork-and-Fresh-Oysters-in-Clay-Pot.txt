1/2 c  Peanut oil

1/2 lb Boneless pork butt, cut in

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
1 ts 5-spice powder
1 ts Lemon juice
1/4 c  Medium sherry
2 ts Thin soy sauce
2    Cloves garlic, minced
Marinating:  Combine marinade ingredients in bowl large enough to hold
pork, mixing well. Add pork, cover, and marinate at room temperature for 1
hour.

Braising:  Drain pork, taking care to remove pieces of garlic. Heat oil in
wok until it begins to smoke. Fry pork cubes, a few at a time, until brown
and crusty. Do this quickly to sear meat without cooking it through. Drain
in Chinese strainer or on paper towel. Strain and reserve cooking oil.

Clay Pot:  In cool clay pot, combine water, bean sauce, dark soy, minced
ginger, dried orange peel, and sherry. Bring to boil, then add braised pork
cubes. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, wash
and trim green onions, cut into 2" sections. Drain oysters. When pork has
simmered 30 minutes, add onions and oysters. You can stop the dish before
adding oysters and onion. Cover and cook at medium heat for 15 minutes
more. Turn up to boil, dribble in cornstarch paste to make light gravy.
Serve with garnish of parsley.
