Title: Char-Grilled Kangaroo Kebabs and Smoked Eggplant Puree
Categories: Australian, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Garlic cloves, minced
25 ml Lemon juice
1 tb Tahini
1/2 ts Sea salt
50 g  Yoghurt, plain
2 ts Parsley leaves, chopped.
600 g  Kangaroo fillet, trimmed and
-cubed
2 ts Coriander seeds, roasted and
-ground
1 ts Black pepper, freshly ground
2    Medium-sized eggplants
Roll the cubes of kangaroo meat in the ground coriander seed and black
pepper, coating lightly. Skewer meat and put on an oiled tray until ready
to cook. Grill the eggplants until skins are black and blistered. Cool
slightly and skin them while still warm. Squeeze out the bitter juices.
Mash the flesh with a large fork gradually adding the garlic, lemon juice,
tahini, sea salt, parsley and yoghurt. Grill the kebabs under (or over)
high heat, brushing with oil to keep moist being careful not to toughen the
meat. Spoon the eggplant puree onto the plates. Remove skewers and pile the
meat cubes onto the puree. Serve immediately.
