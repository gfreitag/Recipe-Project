Title: Zuppa Di Pomodoro Freddo
Categories: Italian, Sauces
Yield: 1 servings
-Chilled Tomato Soup
Serves 4

3 pounds fresh ripe San Marzano or Roma tomatoes 1 yellow bell pepper 1/2
cucumber 1 onion 1 clove garlic 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 1/2 cup extra
virgin olive oil Salt, pepper and Tabasco sauce to taste

Peel seed and dice the tomatoes, yellow pepper and cucumber. Chop onion and
garlic. Blend all vegetables in a food processor or blender until smoothly
pureed, adding lemon juice and olive oil gradually. Add salt, pepper and
Tabasco sauce to taste. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes for
flavors to blend.

Serve chilled soup in a tureen garnished with thyme croutons. (I just cut
some fresh-baked pane di Ariccia from Carol FieldUs recipe, into 1/2-inch
cubes, brushed them with extra-virgin olive oil in which lots of chopped
fresh thyme had steeped for about 45 minutes, and baked at 350 degrees,
shaking the pan frequently, until golden).
