Mix the last 3 ingredients well, rubbing out all the lumps. Divide the
mixture into 3 equal portions. Place meat in a large bowl and rub
thoroughly with one portion of the above mixture. Let stand 1 day. Follow
same procedure on second and third days. Turn meat several times a day.
Allow meat to remain in bowl for 7 more days, then hang in a warm place
until meat stops dripping. Whe dripping has stopped, hang in a cool shed
about 6 weeks to dry thoroughly. Wrap meat in clean muslin bags and keep in
cool place. If in 6 months meat becomes too dark, soak it in cold water for
24 hours and wipe dry. Wrap again in muslin bags and hang in cool place.
