Categories: Mideast, Rice/grains
Yield: 4 servings
8    Curry leaves
2    Spring onions, cut in 2 mm
-slices
1 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1/2 ts Ground turmeric
1 tb Oil
1/2 c  Peanuts, unsalted, shelled
-and roughly chopped
1 tb Dessicated coconut
1 c  Coconut milk
2 c  Water
1    Lemon grass stem, 10 cm long    2 1/2 c  Long grain rice
1. Heat oil in pan.  Add nuts, stir until golden; stir in coconut. 2. Add
coconut milk and water to pan.  Stir in lemon grass, curry leaves and
spring onions. Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2
minutes. Add cumin, cardamom and turmeric, bring to a boil. Add rice, cook,
uncovered, until steam holes appear at the surface. 3. Cover pan with a
tight fitting lid, reduce heat to very low. Cook for 10 minutes. Lift lid,
check if rice is cooked, continue cooking if required. NOTE: Jasmine or
Basmati rice can be used instead of long grain rice if preferred. Avoid
lifting the lid of the pan while rice is cooking, as all the steam will
escape, resulting in gluggy rice. HINT: The curry leaf is native to south
east Asia and as its name suggests, lends a rich curry-like flavour to
Asian dishes. Source: Cooking Indonesian
