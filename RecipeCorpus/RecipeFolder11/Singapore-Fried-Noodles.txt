1 ts Water
1/2 lb Barbecued pork
2    Stalks celery
2 c  Bean sprouts, blanched
-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Chili oil
1/2 c  Stock
2 ts Thin soy sauce
Noodles:  Rinse shrimp noodles.  Boil noodles in water until cooked but
still firm.  These thin noodles only take about 3 minutes to reach this
stage.  Drain, reserving boiling water, & rinse with cold water until
noodles are cooled & will not stick together.  Place in oiled bowl,
refrigerate until firm.  The noodles must be firm before frying. Can be
prepared day before.

Preparation:  Wash & soak dried shrimp for 30 minutes; cut into thin
pieces. Combine egg & water; cook as very thin omelet; cool; slice into 2"
long shreds. Thinly slice pork to match. Blanch bean sprouts in noodle
water (this water will have other uses, so hold onto it). Peel strings off
celery stalks, thinly slice. Peel & halve onions, slice thinly. Core
pepper, slice thinly in 2" lengths. Slice tomato in thin wedges. OR: slice
these vegetables to match size of bean sprouts for better looking dish (a
good shredder does this job quickly). Mix sauce ingredients in bowl.

Stir-fry:  Add 1/2 of peanut oil to hot wok.  When oil begins to smoke,
toss in garlic, ginger, shrimp & vegetables, except tomato; stir-fry on
high heat for 2 minutes. Add sauce, & continue cooking until sauce reduces
by half. Remove to holding bowl.

Rinse wok; return to high heat; when it is dry, reduce heat to medium & add
remaining peanut oil.  Heat oil to moderate (don`t let it smoke); add curry
powder, stirring to mix with oil. Avoid burning curry; if it burns, start
over.  Cook curry powder for about 30 seconds. Add noodles a fist-full at a
time, breaking noodles into short pieces. Toss noodles to coat & heat them.
When hot, add cooked shrimp & vegetables; toss together to mix. Turn off
heat. Add pork, egg shreds & tomato wedges; mix together. Serve. By the
time dish is on the table, tomatoes will be hot, but still firm.
