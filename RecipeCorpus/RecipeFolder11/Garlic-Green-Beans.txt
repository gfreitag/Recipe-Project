Title: Garlic Green Beans
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Walnut or olive oil
1/8 ts Salt (optional)
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 lb Green beans, ends trimmed
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 tb Red-wine vinegar
I tried this recipe from Jane Brody's "Good Food Gourmet" for Thanksgiving
last year and my family really loved it! Steam beans for 5 to 7 minutes or
until tender crisp. Rinse briefly under cold water to preserve color, but
do not chill. Cover and keep warm. In a large bowl, combine garlic and
remaining ingredients. Add warm green beans and toss until well coated. If
desired, you can reheat in microwave before serving. If you don't want such
a strong flavor of garlic, simmer the unpeeled cloves of garlic in a cup of
water for 5 minutes before peeling and mincing. I don't think the original
recipe is too strong though.
