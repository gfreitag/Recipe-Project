Title: Sweet Almond Pudding with Dates
Categories: Chinese, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Sliced pitted red dates
3 tb Cold milk, if needed
1/3 c  Sweet rice flour
2 tb + 2 t almond powder
1/2 c  Cold water
3 c  Cold milk
In small bowl, mix rice flour & almond powder; add cold water a little at a
time to make a thick, smooth paste. Thin further with 1/2 cup of milk. Pour
into heavy saucepan, add remaining milk, and slowly heat to just under
boiling, stirring constantly.  Keep stirring to prevent lumping & burning.
Turn off heat, cover & remove to cool place. You can prepare this first
stage anytime ahead of dinner, keep covered & refrigerated. Pudding should
be finished just before serving.

Just before serving, reheat pudding, stirring constantly. When hot, add
sugar a little at a time. Keep stirring. Add sliced dates. Cook just under
boiling point for 1 minute.  Add extra milk if pudding becomes too thick:
it should have consistency of melted ice cream. Pour into individual bowls
& serve hot.
