Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from the
recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and celery.  The
recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and quartered.
Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers) from
meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in the recipe(s)
you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2 pounds backs, necks
and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc. FOR
BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds beef shank (preferred) or other
beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones
(preferred) or other pork bones. FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
rinsed shrimp heads and/or shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab
shells (2-1/2 to 3 quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills
removed), or any combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster
liquor for all or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If
desired, you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
thoroughly browned.  Then use them to make your basic stock.  (When you
brown the bones and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on
the surface, which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it
dissolves in the stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to
cover the other stock ingredients.
Place all ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil
over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours, preferably 8 (unless
directed otherwise in a recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep
about 1 quart of liquid in the pan.  The pot may be uncovered, or set the
lid on it askew.  Strain, cool and refrigerate until ready to use.
(Note: Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20 to 30
minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO MAKE A RICH
STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering until evaporation
reduces the liquid by half or more.  For example, if your recipe calls for
1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2 cups of strained basic stock.
(Rich stocks are needed when a sauce requires lots of taste but only a
limited amount of liquid, for example, "Oyster Sauce for Beef." From The
Prudhomme Family Cookbook
