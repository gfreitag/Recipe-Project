The beauty of this recipe is that accurate measurements can go out the
window. Add more or less of the spicings that you like. Toss it all in and
mix it up. Patty up and grill. Serve like a regular hamburger. Tip: If you
have a grill that tells the temperature, keep it down! Or let the coals die
down some. Don't put lean buffalo meat in the flame. ( Buffalo is a lean
red meat and is some what dry so you have to cook it slowly to keep the
juices in.) These burgers were taste tested by the usually critical
teen-age crowd. They asked for seconds. I take that as an impressive OK.
