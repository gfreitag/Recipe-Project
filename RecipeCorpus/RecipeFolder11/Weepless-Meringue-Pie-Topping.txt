Title: Weepless Meringue Pie Topping
Categories: Toppings
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
3    Egg whites
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 ts Plain gelatin
1 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Cold water
1/2 c  Boiling water
Mix gelatin, cornstarch and cold water in small saucepan.  Stir until lumps
are dissolved.  Add boiling water.  Bring mixture to boil and cook 1
minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and stir in sugar. Pour
Mixture into small bowl and refrigerate exactly 25 minutes

After 25 minutes are up, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in medium bowl
until soft peaks form.  Add gelatin mixture and vanilla, and continue
beating until mixture is very stiff and resembles whipped cream.

Fill 9-1/2-inch baked pie crust with your favorite pie filling (lemon,
chocolate, banana, and so on) and top with meringue mixture, being sure to
seal in filling by touching meringue to all edges of crust. Bake at 350
degrees until meringue is lightly browned, 15-20 minutes. Place in
refrigerator, uncovered, until cool, then cover.
