Preheat oven to 450F.  Lightly coat an 8-inch pie pan with nonstick cooking
spray.  Combine 1/2 c of the unbleached flour with the whole wheat flour in
a bowl, or in a food processor bowl, and add the margarine. In the bowl,
use a fork to crumble the flour and margarine into a coarse mixture. In the
food processor, use the metal chopping blade and pulse the machine 10-12
times to cut the margarine into small pieces. As you form the mixture, add
the ice water, 1 tbspoon at a time, until the lumps appread moist. Transfer
the dough to a board, and lightly knead it for 1 minute. Form into a ball,
place in a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 10
minutes. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tbspoons of flour on a pastry board and
lightly coat the rolling pin with flour.  On the floured board roll the pie
dough out in a circle slightly large than your pie pan. Carefully transfer
the dough to the prepared pie pan. Crimp the edges of the dough against the
rim of the pie pan. You can use this unbaked pie shell in many recipes,
except for fruit fillings.  If you make a fruit-filled pie, you must
pre-bake the shell so the fruit juices won't make it soggy. To pre-bake it,
cover the crust with tinfoil, place 2 cups of clean beans or pie weights in
the center of the crust, and bake for 10 minutes. YIELD: Makes 1 8-inch pie
shell - Serving 8.
