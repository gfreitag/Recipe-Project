Title: Fettuccine Alfredo Ii
Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Butter or margarine
- softened
Grated Parmesan cheese
Freshly ground black pepper
1 c  Semolina flour
1 c  All-purpose unbleached flour
2    Eggs
Olive oil
1 ds Salt
Combine flours in large bowl. Mix well. Make well in center of flour and
drop in eggs, 1 tablespoon oil and salt. Using fork, beat mixture into
flour, working up to rim gradually and incorporating wet ingredients with
flour thoroughly. If too dry, add a few drops of water. When combined,
moisten hands with oil and work dough, kneading and folding about 10
minutes until smooth and pliable. Continue kneading 5 minutes longer until
dough is completely smooth. (Kneading, because of toughness of semolina
flour, will be difficult, but keep going. Keep hands moistened with oil
during kneading process to help stretch dough and make it pliable.) Form
into ball, cover and let stand 10 minutes to rest. Process through pasta
machine according to manufacturer's directions or roll very thin. Cut for
fettuccine noodles. Use at once or allow to dry and store for future use.

When ready to serve, drop fettuccine in boiling salted water and cook until
fettuccine rises to surface, about 2 minutes. Quickly drain and place in
warm bowl containing half of softened butter. Top with lumps of remaining
butter and 1/3 to 1/2 cup cheese. Toss lightly, using fork and spoon, about
2 minutes, until fettuccine is well coated and creamy sauce is formed.
Serve sprinkled with pepper and additional grated cheese.
