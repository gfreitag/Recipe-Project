Anne's note: 'Chez Piggy' is a terrific restaurant in the beautiful
city of Kingston, Ontario where I worked one summer as part of a
field work/study placement. The owner, Zalman Yanovsky, was once a
member of The Lovin' Spoonful. This cake is always on the menu.

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in large mixing bowl. Add
butter and beat with a mixture until blended. In another bowl, combine
milk, eggs and vanilla. Beat into flour/butter mixture until very well
combined. Stir in poppy seeds and lemon peel.

Transfer batter to buttered, floured 9 cup bundt pan or tube pan.
bake in preheated 325F oven for 1 1/4 hours. Cool 10 minutes and turn
cake on to serving platter.

Cook glaze ingredients until sugar dissolves. Glaze top and sides of
warm cake with syrup.

MAKES: 1 CAKE *If you are using unsalted butter, add 1/2 tsp salt to
the recipe in place of a pinch of salt.
