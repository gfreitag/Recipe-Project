Title: QUICK CHOCOLATE CAKE
Categories: Cake/cookie, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
MMMMM------------------------CAKE MIXTURE-----------------------------
1 3/4 c  Flour, self-raising
-(up to 2 C)
1 1/4 c  Caster sugar, or
-white sugar chopped
-in the blender
6 tb Cocoa (Use more if
-you like)
1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1/4 ts Salt
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
4 oz Butter (or margarine)
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 c  Cream, whipped with
-a little icing sugar
3 oz Cooking chocolate
1/2 oz Copha
Nuts
Sift the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Soften the
butter and add with the milk and vanilla to dry ingredients. Beat for
2 mins with a wooden spoon or until smooth. Add eggs and beat another
2 mins. Pour into an 8-inch round cake tin (I find the collapsible
type best). Cook in a moderate 350-375 degree F. oven for 1 hour.

Turn the cooled cake over, slice into two layers and fill with cream.
Melt chocolate with copha (do not burn) and pour over cake, dribbling
it down the side. Decorate with almonds, pecans or walnuts.

NOTES:

*  Dangerously delicious chocolate cake.

*  Self-raising flour is popular in Britain and Australia, and hard
to find in North America. Substitute about 2 cups of ordinary flour,
all-purpose with about 1/2 t of salt and about 3 t of baking powder
mixed in.

*  The North American equivalent of caster sugar is "granulated
sugar." There is no equivalent of copha, but a mixture of butter and
coconut is better than nothing. Crisco has the right cooking
properties to substitute for copha, but the wrong flavor.

*  You can pour a little Grand Marnier into the cake before spreading
the cream in the middle, but it doesn't need it.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour to cool and 5
minutes decorating. 5 minutes to eat.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients, though the cocoa and cream are
not critical.
