Kevin Aiken said to Randy Rigg on 9/5/94: Randy, that seems like a
fast and simple way to make french onion soup,but I would make 2
suggestions in addition to the sliced onions take 1 lagre onion, skin
it and cut it in half, then either saute or roast the onions off
until very brown, but not burnt, and add them to the broth, it will
help give it a deep color and a richer flavor...the second is it
can't be french onion soup with out a little shot of sherry in it 8-)
