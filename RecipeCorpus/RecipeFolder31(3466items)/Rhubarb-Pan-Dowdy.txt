Title: Rhubarb Pan Dowdy
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
3 c  Rhubarb; cut in chunks
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Flour
1    Egg; well beaten
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter; melted
1/2 c  Sugar
Stew the fruit, sweeten to taste and pour into a 9x9 cake pan. I
frequently do this in the microwave. Sift dry cake ingredients
together. Mix the egg, milk and butter and stir gently into the flour
mixture. Pour the cake mixture over the rhubarb and cook at 400 for
20 to 25 minutes until the top is golden brown. For a real cholestrol
disaster, pour heavy cream over this while warm for serving. It
tastes great without it but I like the cream for company. The cake
can be baked by itself in an 8x8 pan. Bake about 20 - 25 minutes. It
makes a wonderful shortcake for fruit. The cookbook (Fanny Farmer)
calls it Cottage Pudding. Submitted By BILL SPALDING   On   05-21-95
