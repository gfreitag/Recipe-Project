Title: Microwave Corn On The Cob
Categories: Microwave, Fatfree, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Corn on the cob
The easiest corn on the cob--peel the shuck back and rinse the corn
with water. Put the shuck back in place and microwave. The time
depends on the amount of corn and the power of your microwave. I use
5 minutes for one ear and add a minute for each other ear. Let the
corn sit for a minute or so or you might scald yourself with steam
when you break off the bottom of the shuck and remove shuck and silk
in one operation. I can't wait for summer and fresh corn.
