Use only mealy potatoes. Peel and slice as thin as you can. Soak in
cold salt water (1 tb salt to 2 c water) for an hour or more. Drain
and wipe them dry with a towel. Be sure they're dry or the fat will
sputter, and this could be dangerous. Have lard very hot ~ 375
degrees - and dip frying basket in first before adding potatoes, to
prevent sticking. Fry a little less than a cupful at a time. Cook
until light brown on both sides. Drain on absorbent paper and
sprinkle with salt.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
