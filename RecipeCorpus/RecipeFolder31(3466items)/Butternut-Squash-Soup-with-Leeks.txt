Title: Butternut Squash Soup with Leeks
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetarian
Yield: 10 cups
1 lg Butternut squash
-- (about 3 pounds)
2 ts Olive oil
3 md Leeks
6 c  Vegetable stock
1 tb Dried thyme
1 tb Salt (optional)
1 1/2 ts Black pepper
Coutons to taste
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Cut squash in half lengthwise and remove seeds and membrane.  Place
halves (cut-side down) on an oiled baking sheet and bake for 25 to 35
minutes, until tender.  Remove peel from squash when cool enough to
handle. Mash or chop squash into chunks.

Meanwhile, cut off most of the green leaves from leeks (reserve for
another use if desired).  Slice leeks in half lengthwise and rinse
well to remove all traces of dirt.  Cut into 1/4 inch thick slices.
Heat olive oil in Dutch oven or soup pot and add leeks.  Cover and
cook over medium low heat for 10-15 minutes, until leeks are just
barely soft. Stir in the squash, stock, thyme, salt and pepper, and
bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup about 20
minutes. Serve soup topped with croutons.
