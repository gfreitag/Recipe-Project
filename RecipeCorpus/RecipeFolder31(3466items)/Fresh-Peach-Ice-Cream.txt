Extract
1.  In a saucepan with a heavy bottom, combine the cream, milk, egg
yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and vanilla.  Cook over low heat or in a
double bolier, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon all around the
bottom to make sure the custard doesn't stick. 2. Continue cooking
and stirring until custard is as thick as heavy cream (180 degrees).
This cooking will rid the custard of the raw taste of the yolks.
Remove the custard from the heat at once, stirring constantly for a
minute or so. Let cool. 3. To the peaches add the remaining 1/2 cup
sugar.  Stir to dissolve. Add this to the custard. 4. Pour the
mixture into the container of an electric or hand- cranked ice cream
freezer and freeze according to the manufacturer's From: Sandee
