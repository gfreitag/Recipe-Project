Split fish down the back, wipe it well and lay in a greased pan. Mix
butter and other ingredients together, and pour a little over the
fish. Place in a hot oven and bake about 30 minutes, basting with
prepared butter every 10 minutes. Serve very hot. Mmmmmm!

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
