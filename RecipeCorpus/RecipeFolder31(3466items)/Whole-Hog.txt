Quessenberry's Quintessential Hog Mop:

3 quarts cider vinegar
1 1/2 quarts water
3/4 cup salt

Fire up the pit, preferably with a combination of hickory and oak, and
bring it to a temperature of 250. F.

Rut the hog thoroughly with the dry spices and lift it onto the pit,
belly side down.  If the pit has an offset firebox, position the head
facing away from the fire and cover the hams loosely with aluminum
foil. Every hour or so, sprinkle on more dry spices or mop the meat
with the vinegar mixture, alternating between the two applications.

Maintain a steady cooking temperature of 200 f. to 250 f. for 18 to 20
hours, or until the internal temperature of the meat is 165 f. to 170
f.

While the fire dies, allow the hog to sit in the pit for several hours
before carving.
