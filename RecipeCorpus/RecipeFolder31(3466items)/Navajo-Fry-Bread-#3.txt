Categories: Native amer, Breads
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Flour
3 tb Lard (or veg. shortening)
3 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Water
From: Arizona Cookbook.

Measure dry ingredients into deep mixing bowl. Add lard and knead with
hands until lard is in small pea size pieces. Add warm (not hot)
water and knead with hands until dough is smooth and does not stick
to sides of bowl. Knead at least 5 minutes. Cover with dish towel.
Place in warm place and let rest for not less than 30 minutes.

Melt enough lard in heavy 9" skillet so there is about one inch liquid
depth. Heat for deep fat frying. A small piece of dough when dropped
in will rise immediately to surface.

Tear off a piece of dough about 2/3 of tennis ball. Pat and shape
into a 6-8-inch diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Poke a hole in center
with finger. Drop into hot fat, turning only once so that each side
is a light golden brown.

Serve warm. Sprinkle top with sugar, powdered sugar, cinnamon, honey,
jam, refried beans.
