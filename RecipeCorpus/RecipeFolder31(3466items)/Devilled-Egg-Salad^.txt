Peel eggs and slice longways. Carefully remove yolks, so as not to
tear whites. Put yolks in a bowl and mash with fork, making a paste.
Mix remaining ingredients with yolks and blend till quite smooth.
Lightly pile yolks back into egg whites. Chill. Serve on lettuce with
mayonnaise or your favorite dressing. Deviled eggs go very well with
salmon.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven

and all.
