Title: Home-Made Beef Jerky`
Categories: Meats, Cowboy, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
2 lb Flank Steak, Trimmed *
1/2 c  Worcestershire Sauce
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
2 tb Liquid Smoke Flavoring
1 1/2 ts Seasoned Salt
1 1/2 ts Onion Salt
1/2 ts Garlic Powder
1/2 ts Pepper -- freshly ground
Nonstick Vegetable Cooking
Spray
* Use lean venison or elk flank if it is available.

1. Freeze the flank steak until partially frozen, about 1 hr. Using a
sharp knife, cut diagonally across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick
strips. (For chewier jerky, cut with the grain, but this is only
recommended for card-carrying cowboys.)

2. In a large plastic bag (preferably the self-sealing kind), mix the
remaining ingredients except the cooking spray. Add the sliced beef
and mix well. Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up
to 24 hours, turning the bag occasionally so the beef strips are
evenly marinated.

3. Remove an oven rack from the oven and lightly spary the rack with
nonstick vegetable spray. Remove the strips from the marinade,
shaking off excess marinade. Pat the strips dry with paper towels.
Arrange the strips, close together but not touching on the rack. Line
the bottom of the oven with aluminum foil (to catch drips).

4. Preheat the oven to 150 F. Place the oven rack with the jerky in
the oven. Bake until a cool piece of jerky (remove from the oven and
cool 5 mins) breaks when bent, about 5 hours. Blot any surface fat
with paper towels. Cool completely. Store in an airtight container
for up to 1 month at cool room temperature, 3 months in the
refrigerator, or 6 months in the freezer.
