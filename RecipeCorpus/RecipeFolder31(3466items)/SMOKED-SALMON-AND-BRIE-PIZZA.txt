Title: SMOKED SALMON AND BRIE PIZZA
Categories: Breads, Main dish
Yield: 2 pies
PIE: (makes 2 pies)
4 1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Water, lukewarm (105 to 115
Degrees Fahrenheit)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Olive oil
TOPPING: (for one pie)
1 lb Brie, rind discarded, cut
Into small pieces
12 oz Smoked salmon, cut into
Small pieces
1 sm Onion, red, very thinly
Sliced, separated into rings
1/4 c  Olive oil, extra virgin
Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.

Transfer the pie a pizza pan. Bake the pizza until the crust begins to
brown, about 6 minutes. Remove from oven and cover with cheese,
leaving 1/2 inch border around the edges. Arrange the salmon and
onion on top and drizzle evenly with olive oil. Return to the oven
and bake until the crust is golden brown and puffy, the cheese begins
to melt and the salmon is heated thru, about 4 minutes. Remove from
oven to a cutting tray or board and lightly brush the crust with
olive oil. Garnish with dill. Slice and serve immediately.
