Title: Fat-Free Matza Balls
Categories: Jewish, Fatfree, Passover
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Matza Meal
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 ts Powdered instant broth
(chicken or veggie)
2 ts Chopped parsley
(optional)
1 ds Onion powder
3    Egg whites
3 tb Cold club soda
Stir the dry ingredients together

Stir egg whites, club soda, and parsley slightly with a fork and pour
over the dry ingredients.  Mix well and refrigerate at least one
hour.

Form into 8 balls (1 1/2 inch diameter) and drop into a large pot of
boiling slated water or broth.

Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes.  Do not remove
the lid during the cooking period.  Remove matza balls with a slotted
spoon and serve in soup.

[Note:  I have not tried this recipe.  In general, though, matza
balls keep well in the fridge, just warm them up before serving in
soup.]
