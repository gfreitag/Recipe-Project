Categories: Cake/cookie, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
1 c  Flour, all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Mace
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 c  Butter, melted
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Coffee (black), cold
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Raisins
1 c  Fruit, mixed
1 c  Dates
1/4 c  Rum or brandy
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
4 tb Butter
1/2 c  Rum or brandy
1/2 c  Sugar
Mix the melted butter, eggs, rum and coffee together.  Add brown
sugar and mix well. Add rest of dry ingredients and place in a
buttered loaf pan.

Bake at 300 degrees F. for 2 hours or until done (it will separate
from the sides of the pan).  Make glaze when almost completely baked:
Melt (do not boil) butter.  Add rum and sugar.  Stir by hand.  Remove
the cake from the oven and pour half of the glaze over it.  Let it
cool 25 minutes, then turn it over and pour the remaining glaze on
the other side.

NOTES:

*  A traditional European-style fruit cake -- Although fruitcakes
have a bad reputation, this one is *excellent*. My mother has been
making it for years. She originally got the recipe from a friend, but
has since adapted it to suit her fans. (She gets requests for it all
year long.)

*  Don't use glass pans.  This freezes well, if you make more than
you can eat; just be sure to wrap it carefully so it doesn't get
freezer burn. Warm frozen cake in the oven, not the microwave.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 30 minutes finishing.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
