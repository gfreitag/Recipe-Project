Categories: Salads
Yield: 1 recipe
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Uncooked brown rice
3 c  Vegetable stock or water
-- (2 to 3 cups)
3/4 c  French dressing (of choice)
2/3 c  Sliced water chestnuts
1/2 c  Thinly sliced red pepper
-- (sweet)
1/4 c  Minced onion
1/4 ts Garlic powder (optional)
1/8 ts Italian seasoning (optional)
3/4 lb Snow peas
-- tips & strings removed
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms
-- thinly sliced
In a heavy casserole, heat the oil over moderate heat.  Add the rice
and saute for about 5 minutes or until the rice begins to darken;
stir often. Stir in the vegetable stock, cover the pan and reduce the
heat to low. Simmer until the liquid is absorbed about 1 hour.  When
the rice is cooked, toss it while still warm with 1/4 cup french
dressing.  Let rice mixture cool.  Add the water chestnuts, red
pepper, onion, mushrooms and desired seasonings to the rice, then add
another 1/4 cup of dressing and toss. Chill 1 hour.  Meanwhile, cover
the snow peas with boiling water. Let them stand 1 minute, then
drain.  Rinse with cold water and pat dry. Cut the snow peas into 1"
pieces and toss them with 1/4 cup dressing with rice mixture.
