Title: Pretzels
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 servings
1 pk Yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water
5 c  Flour -- approximate
2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
Combine yeast and 1/2 c warm water in a measuring cup, stirring until
dissolved.

Combine 2 c flour, the salt and the sugar in a bowl.  Add dissolved
yeast and remaining 1 c warm water.  Beat vigorously with whisk or
spoon for 2 minutes.  Gradually add enough flour, 1/4 cup at a time,
to make a soft dough.  Turn out of bowl onto a clean work surface.
Knead until smooth and elastic, adding as little flour as necessary,
about 8-10 minutes.

Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and put in a warm
place to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down and divide into 12 equal pieces.  Roll out each
portion into an 18-20 inch long rope, slightly tapered and thinner at
the ends. (My note:  You may have to roll the dough out partially,
let rest, and then finish rolling out to get the rope this long.)
Form into pretzel shapes. Place on 5 inch square of parchment paper.
(Also works on waxed paper sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.)
Cover with towel, let rest 20-30 minutes.

Bring to a boil 6 cups of water, 1/3 c baking soda, and 1/3 c salt in
a large shallow pan.  Gently drop 3 or 4 pretzels into the simmering
water, parchment side up.  Remove parchment.  Poach first side 2
minutes.  Turn and cook other side 2 minutes. Remove pretzels with
slotted spoon and place on towels to cool.

Brush pretzels with an egg white wash (1 egg white mixed with 1 Tbsp
water) and sprinkle with coarse salt.  Bake on a greased, foil lined
(this is important!!) baking sheet at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.
Remove from baking sheet and cool on wire rack.

These freeze well.
