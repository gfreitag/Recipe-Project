Title: Baked Tomato Sauce
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Tomatoes
Yield: 2 servings
4 tb Olive oil
3 lg Tomatoes, unpeeled & cubed
3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1 ea Dried red chile, minced
2 ts Basil
2 tb Parsley
1 1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Marjoram
Rigatoni, served hot
In a casserole, toss the olive oil, & tomatoes.  Cover with a tight
fitting lid, preferably place a piece of foil between the lid & the
dish to ensure that there is a good seal.  Place in an oven preheated
to 350F. Let bake for 3 hours.  The sauce will reduce considerably in
this time.

Remove the casserole from the oven, discard the foil.  Stir in the
chile, garlic & herbs.  Return to the oven & let bake for another 10
minutes. Serve tossed with rigatoni or with some other pasta of your
choice.

NOTE:  You could peel the tomatoes if you desire, but you will lose
the tanginess that the peel gives to the sauce.
