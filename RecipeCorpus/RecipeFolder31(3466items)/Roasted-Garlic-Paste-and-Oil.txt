Title: Roasted Garlic Paste and Oil
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Whole garlic heads
(6 to 8 heads)
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
-(use 1 cup for
-roasted garlic oil)
Salt and pepper to taste
Preheat oven to 375F. Slice off top third of each garlic head and
discard or save for another use. Peel off outer layers of skin. Place
close together in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold the
garlic. Pour oil over garlic and season amply with salt and pepper.
Cover with aluminum foil and bake until cloves begin to pop out of
their skins, about 1 hour. Uncover and bake another 15 minutes or
until golden brown.

To make the paste, squeeze the garlic cloves into a bowl and mash
them. To store, cover with a thin layer of the olive oil in which it
baked and refrigerate up to 2 days. Reserve baking oil in a tightly
covered, sterilized glass jar or bottle and use within 1 week.

Makes about 3/4 cup garlic paste and 1/3 cup garlic oil; or 3/4 cup
roasted garlic oil if using 1 cup oil.

Note: the roasted garlic-flavored baking oil is wonderful simply
added to vinaigrettes, for sauting vegetables, or in any recipe
calling for roasted garlic oil.
