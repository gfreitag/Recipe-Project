Title: Sourdough Biscuits`
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 servings
5 c  Unbleached Flour
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Baking Powder
2 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Vegetable Shortening Or
Lard
1 c  Sourdough Starter
2 1/4 c  (Approx) Milk
1 tb Butter -- melted
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Using a pastry blender or two forks, cut the shortening into the flour
mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center
and add the starter. Mix, adding enough milk to make a stiff dough.

2. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough briefly until smooth
and pat out to a 1/2-inch thick circle. Using a 2 1/2- inch round
biscuit cutter or glass, cut out biscuits. Gather up scraps, knead
briefly, and cut out more biscuits.

3. Place the biscuits about 2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Cover
with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled
in volume, about 3 1/2 hrs.

4. Preheat oven to 400 F. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the
melted butter. Bkae until golden brown, 15 to 20 mins. Serve hot.

NOTE: The biscuits can also be baked in a greased 14-inch Dutch oven.
Use instructions from Dutch Oven Biscuits recipe.
