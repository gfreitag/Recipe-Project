Title: Brined Dill Pickles
Categories: Vegetables, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
10 lb 4 to 6-inch cucumbers
3/4 c  Mixed pickling spices
2    To 3 bn fresh or dried
-dill
1 1/2 c  Canning salt
2 c  Vinegar
2 ga Water
Garlic -- optional
Wash and drain cucumbers. Place half the pickling spices and one
layer of dill in a clean pickling container. Add cucumbers to within
4 inches of top. Combine salt, vinegar and water; ladle over
cucumbers. Place a layer of dill and remaining pickling spices over
the top. Add garlic, if desired. Weight cucumbers under brine. Store
container between 70 degrees F. and 75 degrees F. Remove scum that
forms on surface of brine each day. Let cucumbers ferment until well
flavored with dill and clear throughout. Pickles should be ready for
use in about 2 to 3 weeks. Remove pickles from brine. Strain the
pickle brine; bring to a boil. Pack pickles into hot jars, leaving
1/4-inch headspace. Ladle hot liquid over pickles, leaving 1/4-inch
headspace. Remove air bubbles. Adjust two-piece caps. Process 15
minutes in a boiling-water canner. Yield: about 6 quarts.

NOTE:  You may use desalted, brined cucumbers in this recipe. If so,
make the following changes: 1) Use only 1/4 cup canning salt. 2) Let
set in pickling brine 3 weeks before processing. 3) Once a week,
drain liquid; bring to a boil and ladle over cucumbers.
