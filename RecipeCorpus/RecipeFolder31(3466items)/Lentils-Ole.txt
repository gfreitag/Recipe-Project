Title: Lentils Ole
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Water
1 c  Lentils
1 tb Olive oil
4    Cloves garlic -- minced
1/2 c  Scallion -- chopped
1/2 c  Green pepper -- chopped
3/8 ts Ground cumin
1 tb Chili powder
8 oz Tomato sauce
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Molasses
In a large saucepan, bring the water and the lentils to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and simmer the lentils
for 25-30 minutes or until the lentils are tender but not mushy.  Do
not overcook the lentils.

While the lentils cook, in a medium-sized skillet, preferably one
with a nonstick surface, heat the oil, add the garlic, scallions,
green pepper, cumin, and chili powder, and saute the ingredients for
2 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

Stir in the tomato sauce, vinegar, and molasses, and simmer the
mixture for 1 minute.

When the lentils are cooked, add the vegetable mixture to the
lentils, and heat the mixture through before serving it.
