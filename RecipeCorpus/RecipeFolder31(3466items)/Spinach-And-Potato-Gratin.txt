Saute the onion and pepper flakes in 2 tsp of the olive oil in a

until the spinach wilts.  Season liberally with salt and pepper.  Set
aside. Preheat the oven to 350.  Grease a 6 cup casserole and dust

chunks and make a layer of potatoes in the bottom of the prepared
casserole.  Season with salt and pepper.  Top with a third of the
cheddar cheese and a third of the spinach mixture.  Combine with the
eggs, milk, and mustard and pour a third over the top.  Continue to
layer the potatoes, salt and pepper, cheddar cheese, spinach and milk
mixture until all has been used up.  Even the top.  Mix the remaining
bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese and sprinkle evenly over the
top.  Drizzle the remaining olive oil over all.  Bake for 25 minutes.
Increase the oven temp to 450 and bake another 10 minutes, or until
mixture is bubbling and browned.  Cut into wedges and serve.
