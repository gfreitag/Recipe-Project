Title: Old Stone Inn Corn Fritters
Categories: Breads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
6 ea Ears tender fresh corn
3 ea Eggs; separated
7/8 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
Cayenne pepper to taste
2 ts Baking powder
Oil for deep frying
(1) Cut the corn from the cobs, and scrape the cobs well to extract
the milk. You should have 1-1/2 to 2 cups of corn. Mash 1/4 cup of
the corn pulp with a potato masher or in a blender or processor.
(This helps to distribute the corn flavor and extract some starch.)
Return it to the rest of the corn.

(2) Mix the egg yolks with the corn. Sift together the flour, salt,
sugar, cayenne, and baking powder. Add to the corn and mix well.

(3) Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry and grainy, and fold
them into the corn mixture.

(4) Heat fresh oil in a deep-fat fryer to about 375 degrees F. Drop
the batter by tablespoonfuls into the fat, and cook the fritters
until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Turn, and when both sides
are golden brown, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
towels. Serve at once.
