Title: Lima Bean Cheese Bake
Categories: Main dish, Casseroles, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Lima beans, cooked, dried,
-drained
1 md Onion, chopped
3 tb Catsup
3 tb Flour, whole wheat
1 1/2 c  Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 1/2 c  Milk
Preheat oven to 350F. Combine beans, onion, catsup, and flour in a
shallow 2 quart casserole. Add 1 cup cheese. Pour milk over beans,
top with remaining cheese. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes until sauce
is thickened and bubbling. As it cools, the sauce will thicken
further.

We serve this with Irish Soda Bread, and mixed vegetables or a salad.
You can bake the soda bread while the beans are cooking, and then pop
the casserole into the already hot oven.
