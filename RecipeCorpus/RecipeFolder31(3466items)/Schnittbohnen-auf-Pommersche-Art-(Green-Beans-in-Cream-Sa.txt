Categories: Aust/german, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 lb Green beans;trimmed and
_thinly sliced
1    Summer savory sprig
Salt
2    Slices fat bacon;finely
_chopped
3 tb Plain flour
2 1/2 c  Milk
Nutmeg; freshly grated
2 tb Parsley; chopped
Boil the beans with the savory sprig in salted water until just
tender. In a saucepan saute the bacon until the fat runs. Blend in
the flour with a wooden spoon and stir over a low heat for 1 or 2
minutes longer to make a pale roux. Gradually add the milk and,
stirring constantly, bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick and smooth. Season
with salt and a pinch of nutmeg, and stir in the parsley. Add the
cooked beans, reheat gently and serve.

In Pomerania and East Prussia this dish was traditionally served with
thick slices of "Katenschinken", the local raw smoked ham, but it
also goes well with most roasted or grilled meat dishes.
