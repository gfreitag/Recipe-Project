Categories: Bbq/grill, Sandwich, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
4    Boned chicken breasts
1 c  Of barbecue sauce (whatever
-you like)
1 1/2 c  Of whole wheat flour or any
-standard chicken
Breading
4 tb Butter
4 tb Oil
Barbecue spice (available at
-any store)
4    Fresh high quality kaiser
-rolls
8    Tomato slices
4 lg Washed lettuce leaves
Slightly flatten chicken breasts with mallet or meat cleaver.
Submerge the breasts in barbecue sauce, cover and refrigerate for 12
hours. Remove breasts from marinade and throw away the marinade. (It
contains chicken blood and uncooked juices).  Wipe excess barbecue
sauce from breast, shake barbeque spice on both sides of the breast
and roll in flour or breading. Be sure that the flour or breading
completely covers the chicken so that no frying oil can sneak in and
get on the chicken.  Heat butter and oil in a straight-sided frying
pan and saute the floured chicken breast until cooked.  About 2 1/2
minutes per side should do it. Press the chicken breast with your
finger.  If the flesh feels soft and slightly mushy, it isn't cooked
through yet.  If the flesh feels firm and bounces back, it is done
and ready to eat. Serve open face on toasted kaiser rolls, garnish
with lettuce and tomato slices. Serve with barbecue sauce on the side
for dunking.
