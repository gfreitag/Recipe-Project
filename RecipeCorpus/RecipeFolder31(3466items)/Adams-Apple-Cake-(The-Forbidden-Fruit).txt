Cake: Beat the eggs together until they are light and frothy; blend
them well with the sugar. Beat in the oil. Sift together the flour,
baking powder, and salt and add this to the egg mixture. Add the
vanilla; beat well. Peel the apples and slice them thin. Mix them
with the sugar and cinnamon.

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Grease a 9 inch by 13 inch pan. Pour in enough batter to cover the
bottom well, a little less than half the batter. Arrange the apples
evenly over the batter and cover them with the remaining batter. Bake
for 1 hour.

Toppings: To serve this as a dessert, spread the cake with whipped
cream sweetened with the 1/4 cup of sugar and flavored with the
cinnamon and rum extract.

To serve it as a coffee cake, brush the top with the melted butter.
Sprinkle a mixture of walnuts, cinnamon and sugar on top. Then place
the cake under the broiler for about 2 minutes. Serve it warm.
