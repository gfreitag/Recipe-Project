Title: Crusty Catfish Parmesan~
Categories: Fish, Seafood, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Dijon mustard
2 tb Milk -- or water
1/2 c  Bread crumbs -- fresh
3 tb Parmesan cheese -- grated
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Paprika
2    12-14 oz
Catfish fillets
Preheat the oven to 450F.  Stir the mustard and milk together in a pie
plate or shallow dish.  In another pie plate, mix the bread crumbs,
Parmesan, margarine, pepper and paprika with a fork or your fingers
until evenly combined. Trim the white or grayish fat from the catfish
fillets and cut each in two equal pieces; rinse in cold water and pat
dry with paper towels. Dip the rounded side of the pieces evenly in
the mustard mixture, then dredge the mustard-coated side of each
fillet in the bread crumb mixture.  Lay the fillets, crumbs up, on a
lightly oiled baking sheet and sprinkle with any remaining crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the fish is tender when
pierced in thickest part with a fork or skewer, 15-18 minutes.
Transfer to dinner plates and serve.

NOTE:  The texture of catfish is similar to that of chicken breast,
and it needs longer cooking than other fillets.  This extra baking
time allows a golden light crust to develop.
