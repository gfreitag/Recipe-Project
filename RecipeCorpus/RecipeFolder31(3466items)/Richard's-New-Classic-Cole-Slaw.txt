Categories: Salads
Yield: 8 servings
1 ea Cabbage, small head

1/2 c  Celery, finely diced
1/4 c  Onion, finely diced
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Vinegar, rice or white

-Richard's Classic Dressing
Grate/shred/process cabbage to desired consistency.  I prefer long
shreds; others prefer very finely chopped.  Do same with carrot. Mix
cabbage, carrots, celery, onion, sugar, vinegar, and salt in large
bowl. Add Richard's New Classic Dressing until desired liquidity.
Refrigerate overnight, stirring occasionally.

Remember, the slaw will break down overnight and become more liquid.
If you prefer your slaw finely chopped it will become VERY wet,
because it breaks down more.  Also, if your slaw is finely chopped,
you will want to process the celery and onion to the same degree.

Richard's New Classic Dressing 1 cup mayo 1/3 cup Dijon mustard 1/4
cup sugar 1/4 cup rice vinegar (or other mild vinegar) Whisk all
together until smooth and sugar has dissolved. Use as a dressing for
potato salad, macaroni salad, cole slaw
