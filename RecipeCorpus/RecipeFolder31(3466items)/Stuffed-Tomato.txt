Categories: Salads, Tomatoes
Yield: 1 servings
1    Tomato
Cottage Cheese
Onions, chopped
Bell Pepper, chopped
Radishes, chopped
4    Olives, chopped
Celery Seeds
Mayo
Durkee's Dressing
Salt/pepper
1/4 ts Horseradish - more or less
--to taste, as a seasoning
--not to make it hot.
I haven't added amounts of most ingredients...I just cut-up
according to preference and what I have on hand. Add mayo according
to amount of other ingredients and just enough Durkee's Dressing to
give it a tangy taste.
Scoop out insides of the tomato and cut into small pieces. Chop
onions, bell pepper, olives and radishes. Mix in cottage cheese,
mayo, Durkees, celery seed, salt, pepper and horseradish.
Place tomato shell over lettuce and fill.
