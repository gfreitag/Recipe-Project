Title: Jellied Tomatoes
Categories: Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
1 pt Canned tomatoes
2    Or 3 whole cloves
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Paprika
1 sl Onion
2 ts Sugar
1 tb Granulated gelatin
1/4 c  Cold water
Cook tomatoes, with juice and pulp, seasonings, onion and sugar for 5
minutes. Mix gelatin with cold water, let stand till soft. Strain hot
tomatoes into gelatin, pressing out juice. Stir to dissolve gelatin.
Taste and add a few drops vinegar if too sweet, more salt if it's too
bland. The seasoning depends upon how acid the tomatoes are. Pout
into a mould and chill until firm. Serve on lettuce with mayonnaise.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
