The day before you plan to cook the ribs, trim off all excess fat. Mix
together the dark chili powder, garlic, pickle spice, oregano,
paprika, black pepper and salt. Combine with enough of the olive oil
to make a paste. Using your fingertips, rub half the paste into the
grain of the meat, covering all the areas. Let ribs set 15 minutes
and repeat the rub with the remaining paste. Mix 2 cup of the
barbecue sauce with the wine. Place ribs in baking pan. Completely
cover ribs with sauce and wine mixture, cover pan and refrigerate
overnight. The next day, light the grill, (if using charcoal, be sure
to use enough coals for 2 to 2 1/2 hours). Remove the ribs from pan
and place on medium hot grill, turning frequently, for about 20
minutes. Be sure not to burn meat. Remove ribs from grill and place
back in pan. Pour remaining 2 cups of barbecue sauce over ribs, cover
pan with heavy foil and cook on grill over low to medium heat for 1
hour and 20 minutes. Remove pan from grill and siphon off excess
sauce, grease and juice with a turkey baster (place excess in heat
proof bowl). Separate grease from sauce. Place ribs back on grill and
baste with degreased sauce, turning frequently, for about 30 minutes.
Mix remaining 1 cup barbecue sauce with leftover basting sauce and
