Title: Loaf In Crust`
Categories: Breakfast, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
Filling-----
1 lb Braunschweiger
1 c  Bread Crumbs -- fine dry
1    Egg
1/4 c  Chopped Parsley
Crust-----
1    Egg -- slightly beaten
1 pk (8 Oz) Refrigerated Crescent

Preheat oven to 375 F. Combine filling ingredients and press firmly
into deep small bowl (this will be the shape of the loaf). Set aside.
For the crust, unroll biscuit dough and remove 1 rectangle (2
triangles). Place in the center of baking sheet. This serves as a
base for the Braunschweiger loaf covering. Separate remaining dough
into 6 triangles. Make a star shape by arranging each triangle around
the rectangle and sealing the edges that touch. Invert the bowl
containing the Braunschweiger filling in the center of star-shaped
crust. Pull points of dough to center top of loaf, lapping edges for
a continuous crust. Brush entire surface with egg. Bake 50 mins, or
until crust is deep golden brown. Cut into wedges for serving. Makes
4 main dish servings.

Ham Filling Variation: Combine 3 cups ground ham with 1/2 cup shredded
Swiss cheese, 1 tsp instant onion and 1 slightly beaten egg.
