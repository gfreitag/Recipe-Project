Title: MOM STERN'S NOODLE KUGEL
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 12 servings
6    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1 tb Vanilla
4 oz Raisins (1 small box)
4    Apples
1 lb Muller's Wide Egg
-Noodles (one box)
4 oz Butter (1 stick)
Cinnamon (for top)
Peel the apples and and slice them into small wedges.

Beat the eggs until they are foamy, add the sugar gradually and beat
well.

Cook the noodles according to package directions.  Drain.

Melt the butter in a 9x13 metal baking pan.  Swirl it around to coat
the pan, and then pour the excess butter into the egg mixture. Add
baking powder and vanilla to egg mixture, mix well, and then slowly
add drained noodles, apples and raisins. Mix thoroughly until all the
noodles have been coated and look gooey.

Pour the egg/noodle mixture into the metal pan, top with cinnamon if
you desire, and bake at 425 degrees F. for about 45 minutes to an
hour, or until the top looks a little brown and crispy. The kugel
should feel springy to the touch and not be "wet." Let cool, cut into
squares and serve.

NOTES:

*  Egg noodles, raisins, cinnamon and apples.  Yield:  Serves 12.

*  This feeds about 12 very hungry people (knoshers, as we call them)
or 16 normal ones.  What you don't eat right away you can wrap in
aluminum foil and freeze for a month or two. If it's too sweet for
your taste, you can use peaches or other fruit instead of the raisins.

*  Warning:  this stuff sits very heavy in the ol' stomach, so don't
try to eat more than 2 pieces in a 24-hour period.

*  Don't thank me, thank my mom.
