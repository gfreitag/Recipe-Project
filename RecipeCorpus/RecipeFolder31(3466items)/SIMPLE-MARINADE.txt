Title: SIMPLE MARINADE
Categories: Condiments, Meats, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1 tb Soy sauce (dark)
1 tb Brown sugar
1 ts Oil
1    Garlic clove
Crush the garlic and mix all ingredients together.  Add meat (steak)
and leave for at least 1 hour, the longer the better.

NOTES:

*  A simple and quite superb meat marinade -- This is a truly
wonderful marinade.  Just take the steak out of the freezer in the
morning before you go to work and pop it in the marinade. Yield: 1
serving .

*  The recipe calls for 1 clove of garlic, but we often use 2 or
more.  Be careful with the Soy Sauce, if it is too salty the marinade
is not so good. This basic mixture can be varied infinitely;
particularly, you can use more marinade than this for one piece of
meat.  I like to use sesame oil, or mustard oil for a little "bite"
instead of a bland vegetable oil.
