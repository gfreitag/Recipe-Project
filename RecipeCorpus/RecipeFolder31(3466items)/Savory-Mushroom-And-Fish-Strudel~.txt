3/4 c  Half And Half

1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/2 ts Dried Dill Weed
Seafood alternatives: Sea Bass, Halibut.

To make the filling:  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over
med-high heat.  Add the onion, garlic, mushrooms, celery and cabbage
and saute until the vegetables are starting to soften, about 5
minutes.  Stir in the lemon juice, turn the heat to high and fold in
the fish.  Add the cream cheese and fold into the mixture, taking
care not to break up the fish. Season with salt and pepper and cook
the mixture for about 2 1/2 minutes.

Whisk together the half and half, wine, flour and dillweed.  Add the
liquid mixture into the filling and carefully fold in.  Turn the heat
down to med-high and cook until thickened, 1-2 minutes longer.
Remove from the heat, cool to room temperature and then chill.  Store
regrigerated fro up to 2 days.

Preheat the oven to 400+.  Working quickly, layer 6 phyllo sheets,
lightly brushing with melted butter between each sheet.  (See phyllo

package instructions for covering dough not being worked with.)  Spoon
about 1/3 of the filling (about 1 1/3 cups) along one short end of the
dough, about 1" from the edge.  Roll up the phyllo dough, not too
tightly. Brush the last edge lightly with melted butter and seal it
against the roll. Place the phyllo roll seam-side down on the work
surface. Score the roll to mark 8 equal pieces with a serrated knife,
cutting about 1/2" into the top. Brush the outside of the roll with
melted butter and transfer to a lightly oiled baking sheet, seam-side
down; cover loosely with plastic wrap.  Make 2 more phyllo rolls with
the ingredients.  (The rolls can be assembled up to 4 hours before
baking.) Bake until golden brown, 18-22 minutes.  Remove from the
oven and let cool at least 20 minutes before serving.  Slice each
roll into 8 pieces with serrated knife.
