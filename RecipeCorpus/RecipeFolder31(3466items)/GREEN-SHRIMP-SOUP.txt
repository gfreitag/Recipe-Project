NOTES:

*  Fine pea soup with shrimp and champagne -- This is a recipe out of
a German low-calorie cookbook. It is a simple recipe for a really
delicate soup. It can be served as a festive appetizer or as a
gourmet snack.

*  The fresh spices can be substituted by dried spices.

*  If you use canned shrimp, never let them boil.  They would become
tough and lose their delicate taste.
