A 600 year old fort now guards the hill town of Hunza Baltit, but
other forts had existed for centuries beforehand. Built in the
Tibetan style, this aged building is a reminder that the Silk Route
once ran through here, linking China to the Mediterranean. This dish
has Chino-tibetan roots, the basis of true Balti cooking.

Heat the ghee or oil in your karahi on high heat, then stir fry the
garlic and the spices for 30 seconds. Add the onion, reduce the heat
and stir fry for 10 minutes, allowing the onions to become
translucent and begin to brown.
Add the masala paste and the chicken. Raise the heat again and
bring to a brisk sizzle, stir frying as needed for about 5 minutes.
Add the stock or water bit by bit, along with the beetroot, and say
sauce. Simmer, stirring, on a lower heat for about 10 minutes. Test
that the chicken is cooked right through by cutting into one of the
peices. When cooked as you like it, add the garam masala, coriander
and aromatic salt.

NB You may substitute any poultry or game meat or joints for this
