With input from several antique stores use the following process with
abused cast iron.

1. Clean all burnt-in grease with a oven cleaner, may take several
repeats to remove all the "paint like" grease. Helps to place the
sprayed cast iron in a plastic bag and wait 12 hours to repeat.

2. Clean with a heavy brush after each 12 hour period.  And re-spray
with oven cleaner.

3. Place clean cast iron in enough vinegar to cover, or use 1/4 pint
of acetic acid in 3-4 gallons of water. Acetic acid is available at
any drugstore for about 10 dollars a pint.  With rubber gloves on,
check ever-so-often if all the rust is removed.  With vinegar it will
take weeks, while with acetic acid will take days.  Rubbermaid makes
some plastic containers with lids that work great for the vinegar.
Any hardware store should have them.

4. With the rust removed do a final cleaning with a heavy brush.  Dry
cast iron with a towel, and with a brush apply mineral oil to all
surfaces, allowing the oil to soak in. After about 10 minutes place
the cast iron in a stove that is set at about 150 degrees and let
bake for a half hour or until the smoke gets too heavy.

IF YOU PLACE THE CAST IRON IN THE STOVE BEFORE APPLYING OIL IT WILL BE
WELL RUSTED WHEN REMOVED FROM STOVE.

5. Once cast iron is cooled down, apply a non-salted cooking oil and
repeat the baking process. Mineral oil is absorbed much better than
regular cooking oil, and provides a "deep" protection.  While cooking
oil protects the outside of the cast iron.

6. Re-apply the non-salted cooking oil a couple more times and
re-bake for optimal protection. Repeat re-oiling once/twice a year or
as needed.
