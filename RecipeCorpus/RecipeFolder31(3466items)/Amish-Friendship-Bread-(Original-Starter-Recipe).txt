Title: Amish Friendship Bread (Original Starter Recipe)
Categories: Penndutch, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
-Linda DiSanto, Austin,
-Texas
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 1/2 c  Warm water
2 c  Sifted flour
1 tb Sugar
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup of the warm water in a deep glass or plastic
container.  Stir in remaining warm water, flour and sugar. Beat until
smooth.  Cover with loose fitting cover. DO NOT REFRIGERATE! The
starter requires 10 days for fermentation as follows:

DAYS 1, 2, 3 and 4:... Stir batter DAY 5:................ Add 1 cup
each milk, flour, sugar and stir DAYS 6, 7, and 8:..... Stir batter
each day DAY 10: ............. Add 1 cup each flour, sugar, milk;
stir.

The batter is ready to use.

This makes 3 cups batter to use in the recipes. If you want to you
may pour 1 cup batter each into 3 containers and give 1 or 2 away.

(Seems to me that this will make more that three cups batter -
perhaps it means 3 portions of batter?)

Save 1 cup to begin process all over again OR you can use all 3 cups
batter for the recipes at 1 time and when you want to bake these
again just start the starter again.
