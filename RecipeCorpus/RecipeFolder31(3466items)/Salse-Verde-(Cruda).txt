Title: Salse Verde (Cruda)
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Tomate verde
(husks removed, rinsed
1/2 c  Cilantro
(loosely packed/roughly
Chopped
1 lg Garlic clove
(peeled and roughly chopped
2 tb Chopped white onion
1/2 ts Sea salt
Put the tomate verde into a pan, barely cover with water, and bring
to a simmer.  Continue to cook until the tomates turn a lighter,
faded green and are just soft but not falling apart--about 5 minutes.
Set aside to cool. Put 1/2 cup of the cooking water into a blender
jar, add the cilantro, garlic, onion, and salt, and blend until
almost smooth.  Drain the tomates and add them to the blender jar;
blend for a few seconds just to break them up roughly. The sauce
should have a rough texture. Tomatillos are used extensively for
various sauces, salsas, etc.  You usually parboil or blanch them for
5-7 minutes or so in boiling water. They are also sometimes called
tomate verde in Mexican cookbooks.   From THE ART OF MEXICAN COOKING
