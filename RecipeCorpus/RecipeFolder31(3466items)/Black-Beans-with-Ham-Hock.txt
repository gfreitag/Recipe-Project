Title: Black Beans with Ham Hock
Categories: Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1    Smoked ham hock
4 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Olive oil
2 tb Garlic, minced
1 sm Onion
-peeled and diced
6 c  Black beans,
-soaked overnight
-in water to cover
1 ts Dried thyme
2    Bay leaves
1/4 ts Hot red pepper flakes
2 ts Sherry vinegar
Fresh ground pepper
In a 3-quart saucepan, cover the ham hock with the stock. Bring to a
boil, then simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Add water if necessary to
keep the ham hock covered. Remove from heat and reserve.

In another 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add
the garlic and onion and saut lightly for about 5 minutes, until
softened but not browned.

Drain the black beans from their soaking liquid and add them to the
pot. Cover them with the ham hock liquid and add the ham hock, thyme,
bay leaves, and red pepper flakes. Add more stock or water if
necessary to cover the beans. Bring the beans to a boil, stirring
occasionally to keep them from sticking. Lower the heat and simmer
for about 1 hour 35 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more
liquid if necessary. The beans should be thoroughly cooked, stew-like
with a silky consistency.

Remove the bay leaf and ham hock;l discard the bay leaf. When the ham
hock is cool enough to handle, cut the meat off the bones, shred or
chop it, and return it to the beans. Season the beans with sherry
vinegar and black pepper and serve hot.
