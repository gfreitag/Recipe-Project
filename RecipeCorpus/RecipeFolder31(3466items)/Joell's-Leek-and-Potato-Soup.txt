Title: Joell's Leek and Potato Soup
Categories: Low cal/fat, Vegetarian, Soup/stew, Potatoes
Yield: 8 servings
5    Potatoes
4 pt Cold water
6 md Leeks
4 cl Garlic, crushed
1 tb Olive oil
4 tb Dry skim milk powder
1 ts Yeast extract
2 ts Ground black pepper
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Caraway seeds
Peel and cube the potatoes.

Top and tail the leeks, then slice into rounds. Wash in a bowl of cold
water, drain and rinse.

Saute the garlic in a large deep soup pan in the oil with the leeks
until tender. Add the potatoes. Increase the heat bringing the liquid
to a rolling boil. Add the skim milk powder. Reduce the heat & add
the yeast extract Stir well, reduce heat and add, black pepper, bay
leaves and caraway seed.

Simmer until everything is creamy in texture. Serve hot w/ caraway
seeds sprinkled on top. Next time I will process some of the soup to
make this thicker, I was too lazy and it tasted to good to bother.
