Title: Fines Herbes Omelets~
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
10 lg Eggs
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Loosely packed chopped herbs
2 ts Canola oil
2 ts Unsalted butter
* A mixture of 1/4 cup chopped parsley and 1/4 cup combined tarragon,
chives, and chervil.

Using a fork, beat the eggs, pepper, and salt in a bowl until
thoroughly mixed and well combined.  Stir in the herbs. Heat 1
teaspoon each of the oil and butter in a 10-inch nonstick omelet pan
over high heat.  When the oil and butter are hot, add half the egg
mixture.  Stir it continuously with a fork while shaking the pan for
about 2 minutes to create the smallest possible curds.  When most of
the mixture is solid, cook it without stirring, for 10 seconds to
create a thin "skin" on the underside of the mixture, binding it
together. Roll the omelet by bringing together two of its edges from
opposite sides of the pan.  Invert it onto a plate and repeat the
process, using the remainder of the ingredients to create a second
omelet.  Serve immediately, half an omelet per person.
