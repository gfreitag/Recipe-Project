Title: Gratined Braised Fennel
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
1 lg Fennel bulb
1 c  Chicken stock
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2    Bay leaves
1/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1 tb Olive oil
Preheat oven to 375F.

Cut off th top of the fennel bulb, reserving some of the sprigs. Trim
the base of the bulb and remove any unattractive outer layers. Chop
about 1 tsp of the fennel sprigs, set aside, and reserve the rest for
garnishes if desired.

Cut the bulb in half the long way and place cut side down in a shallow
ovenproof dish. Pour the chicken over the fennel, sprinkle with  tsp
salt (if using canned stock that has added salt, omit the salt here)
and the pepper, add the bay leaves, and loosely cover the dish with
foil. Bake for 40 minutes.

Uncover the fell and continue cooking, letting the chicken stock
reduce, until the fennel is tender when pierced with a fork, about
another 20 minutes, depending on the size of the bulb. The stock
should become sauce-like, but if it looks like it might evaporate
before the fennel is done, add a little water.

While the fennel is baking, prepare the topping by combining the
chopped fennel tops, bread crumbs, thyme, oregano, remaining  tsp
salt, a few grinds of pepper, and the olive oil in a small bowl. Stir
until well blended.

When the fennel is done, remove it from the oven. Sprinkle with the
topping and return it to the oven for 5 minutes. Just before serving,
place under the broiler to brown.

Note: This may be reheated in a 375F for about 20 minutes.
