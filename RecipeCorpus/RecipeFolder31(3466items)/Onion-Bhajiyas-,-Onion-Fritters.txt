Title: Onion Bhajiyas / Onion Fritters
Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers, Indian
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 c  Besan (lentil or chick-pea
-flour)
1 ts Salt or to taste
1 pn Baking soda
1 tb Ground rice
2 ts Ground cumin
2 ts Ground coriander
1/2 ts To 1 tsp chili powder
1    To 2 fresh green chi
-peppers, finely cho
-seeded
2 lg Onions, sliced into
-rings and separated
Scant cup water
Oil for deep frying
Sieve the besan and add salt, baking soda, ground rice, cumin, coriand
chili powder and green chili peppers; mix well.  Now add the onions
an mix thoroughly.  Gradually add water and keep mixing until a soft
thic batter is formed and the onions are thoroughly coated with this
batter Heat the oil over medium heat ( must be 300 to 350 F.) To test
this, t a tiny amount of the batter, about the size of a pea and drop
it into oil. If it floats up to the surface immediately but without
turning brown, the oil is at the correct temp.

Put in as main small amount (about half a tb.) of the onion/batter
mix as the pan will hold in a single layer.  Don't fry too many
fritters a this will result in the outsides overcooking while the
insides remain Reduce the heat to low as the fritters need to be
fried over a gentle to ensure that the batter at the center stays
soft, while the outside turns golden brown and crisp.  This sould
take about 12 to 12 mintues each batch. Drain fritters on paper
towels. These are suitable for freezing.
