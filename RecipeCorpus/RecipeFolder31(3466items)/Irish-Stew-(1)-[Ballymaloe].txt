There are more arguments about what makes a real Irish stew than
about any other recipe in the repertoire.  Some people claim that if
you put carrots in it, it's not an Irish stew any more.  Others say,
leave the carrots in, but no parsnips! -- and the arguments go on.
Here are three good recipes from the experts (Theodora FitzGibbon,
Biddy Whyte Lennon, and Myrtle Allen at Ballymaloe).  Pick the one
that sounds the best to you. I've made them all, and they're all
super.

Shred some of the lamb fat and render it down in a heavy casserole.
Peel onions and potatoes, scrape carrots.  Cut the meat into 8
pieces; only the excess fat is cut away.  Bones need not be removed.
Cut the carrots and onions in quarters. Toss meat in fat until color
changes, and repeat with onions and carrots. Add stock and season
carefully. Put whole potatoes on top.  Simmer gently until the meat
is cooked, 2 hours approx. Pour off the cooking liquid.  Degrease,
and reheat in another saucepan. Check seasoning. Then swirl in
butter, chives, parsley, and pour back over stew.
