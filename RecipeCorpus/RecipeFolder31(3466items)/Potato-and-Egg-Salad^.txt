Categories: Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings

Chop eggs finely with a silver knife to prevent discoloring. Cook
potatoes with skins on; peel and dice. Mix with eggs, season and add
dressing. Serve very cold on a bed of watercress. Many of the recipes
in this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I
have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
