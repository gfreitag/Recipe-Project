Title: Ginger Pancakes
Categories: Main dish, Pcake/waffl
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Flour
6    Egg (extra large)
2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 1/2 tb Sugar
2 ts Ground ginger
12    Scallions, white part only
Thinly sliced
Pam
Using a whisk, mix the flour and eggs until the mixture is smooth.
Heat the milk until it steams and whisk it into the flour mixture.
Whisk in oil, sugar, ginger and scallions.  Cover and refrigerate for
at least 1 hour.  Coat an 8" nonstick skillet with Pam.  Place over
high heat until smoking.  Pour 3 to 4 tbsp of the batter into the
pan, tilting the pan so that the batter runs over the bottom.  Pour
any excess batter back into the bowl.  Cook over high heat until the
batter sets, about 40 seconds. Flip and cook another 20 seconds.
Transfer to a plate.  Make the remaining pancakes in the same way.
You will need to regrease the pan every 3 or 4 pancakes.  Makes 24 to
26 pancakes.  Use 12 for Peking Chicken and reserve the rest for
Vegetable Blintzes.
