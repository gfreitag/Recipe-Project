6    Cloves garlic -- minced
2 cn Roma tomato (28 oz)
1/2 c  Basil leaves -- chopped
1 ts Crushed red pepper

Heat the oil in a large skillet over low heat.  Add the garlic and
cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden brown.  Do not

Using a spoon, break up the tomatoes into small pieces.  Add the
basil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  Simmer, stirring
frequently, for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the sauce is thick.
Taste for seasonings.  Meanwhile, bring water for cooking pasta to a
boil.  Cook the pasta according to the package directions.  Drain and
turn into a serving bowl.  Add a little cooked marinara sauce to the
pasta and toss well.  Spoon the remaining marinara over the top.
Grind additional black pepper over the top if desired. Serve with
thick slices of good bread for dunking.
