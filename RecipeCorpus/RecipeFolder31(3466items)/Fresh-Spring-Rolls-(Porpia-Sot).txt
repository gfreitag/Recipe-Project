FRESH SPRING ROLLS (PORPIA
SOT)
============================
Thais roll up a salad in thin, soft rice paper wrappers. Unlike
deep-fried spring rolls, these are served uncooked and at room
temperature. Serve whole or cut into pieces. You can add meat,
seafood, fresh basil, mint leaves, chiles, avocados or asparagus.
Make sure everythingis cut to a uniform size and that nothing is
runny.

2 oz Bean Sprouts 4 ea Green Onions 1/4 c Bean Curd (Tofu) 8 ea Water
Chestnuts 1 ea Carrot; peeled 3 ea Eggs; lightly beaten 1/4 c Fresh
Coriander Leaves 4 lg Rice Paper Crepes (wrappers) *

NON-VEGETARIAN:

For meat eaters, add one or more of the following:

7 oz Chicken Breasts; steamed; julienned 7 oz Shrimp or Scallops;
steamed 1 ea Chinese Sausage; julienned 7 oz Barbecued Pork; shredded

REMOVE roots from bean sprouts. Keep in a bowl of cold water until
ready to use. Cut green onions into 1 1/2 inch lengths. Cut bean curd
into small cubes or thin strips. Cube water chestnuts. Grate carrot
or cut into fine matchsticks.

IN small, lightly-oiled skillet, cook eggs into a thin omelette.
Drain, cool and cut into thin shreds.

SEPARATE rice paper crepes. Dip one at a time into lukewarm water to
soften; drain and lay on clean work surface. Crepes will turn white
and feel rubbery and pliable.

LAY lines of prepared ingredients along with coriander leaves and
choice of non-vegetarian items on 1/3 of each wrapper. Roll up
tightly, tucking ends as you roll. Transfer to tray; cover with a
damp cloth or plastic wrap until ready to serve (crepes will dry out
within 10 minutes in open air). Cut each roll into five bite-size
pieces. Serve on a bed of lettuce, garnish with raw vegetables and
serve with plum and hot sauce **.

Makes 20 pieces.

* Packages of large, dry rice paper circles are available in Oriental
grocery stores. They keep indefinitely.

** Serve these rolls with a familiar plum sauce and with Sriracha
sauce, the universal Thai bottled sauce made from hot red chiles,
vinegar, salt and sugar. It comes in mild, medium and hot (the rating
is on the neck of the bottle), and is available in many Chinese and
most southeast Asian stores.
