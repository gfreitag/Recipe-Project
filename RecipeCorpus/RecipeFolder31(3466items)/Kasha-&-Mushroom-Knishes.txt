Title: Kasha & Mushroom Knishes
Categories: Appetizers, Jewish, Snacks, Vegetables
Yield: 30 knishes
1 pk Frozen puff pastry sheets
-- 17 1/4 oz
1 c  Onions, diced
1 tb Safflower oil
3 c  Mushrooms, coarsely chopped
1/2 c  Liquid egg substitute
1 c  Kasha
2 c  Vegetable broth
Salt & pepper
1 ts Water
1 tb Poppy seeds
Thaw pastry sheets according to package directions.

Saute onions in oil in a large skillet until lightly browned.  Add
mushrooms & cook until mushrooms are lightly browned.  Set aside.

Place egg substitute in a bowl & toss the kasha in it.  Place tossed
kasha in a large skillet with a tightly fitting cover.  Over high
heat, flatten, stir & chop the kasha with a fork until the grains
separate. Remove from heat.

Bring broth to a boil.  Slowly pour broth over the kasha, cover
skillet, & cook over low heat until the liquid is all absorbed, about
10 minutes. Remove from heat.

Stir in onion-mushroom mixture, salt & pepper.  Cool to room
temperature. Preheat oven to 350F & oil a cookie sheet.

On a lightly floured board, roll one pastry sheet into a 11" X 14"
rectangle.  Cut into 3" circles & place 2 ts filling in the centre of
each circle.  Pull edges up around the filling, completely enclosing
it. Pinch dough together to form a tight package.  Turn packages over
& place seam side down on a cookie sheet.

Beat remaining egg substitute with water to make an "egg wash".
Brush each knish with this wash & sprinkle with poppy seeds.  Repeat
with remaining sheets of dough.

Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Serve warm or at room
temperature.
