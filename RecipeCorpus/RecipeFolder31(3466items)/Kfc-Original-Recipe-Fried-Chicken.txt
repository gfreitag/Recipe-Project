Title: KFC ORIGINAL RECIPE FRIED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
6 c  Crisco cooking oil
1    Egg, beaten
2 c  Milk
2 c  All-purpose flour
4 tb Salt
2 ts Black pepper
1 ts MSG (you can use Accent)
2    Frying chickens with skin,
Each cut into 6 pieces
"In 1983, in his book BIG SECRETS, author William Poundstone hired a
laboratory to analyze a dry sampling of the spice mixture. The
surprising discovery was that instead of identifying 'eleven herbs
and spices,' the analysis showed only four ingredients: flour, salt,
pepper and monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  The cooking
procedure is believed to be the other half of the secret. Colonel
Sanders became famous for using a pressure cooker shortly after its
invention in 1939."

Pour the oil into a pressure cooker and heat over medium heat to
about 400 degrees.  In a small bowl, combine the egg and milk. In a
separate bowl, combine the remaining four dry ingredients. Dip each
piece of chicken into the milk until fully moistened. Roll the
moistened chicken in the flour mixture until completely coated.  In
groups of four or five, drop the covered chicken pieces into the oil
and lock the lid in place. When steam begins shooting through the
pressure release, set the timer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes,
release the pressure and remove the chicken to paper towels or a
metal rack to drain.  Repeat with the remaining chicken.

Note:  If you prefer not to use MSG, you may substitute an additional
1/2 Tbsp. of salt.  Be aware, however, that using MSG produces the
best clone of KFC's Fried Chicken.
