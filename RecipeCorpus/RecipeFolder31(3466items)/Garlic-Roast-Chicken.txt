Title: Garlic Roast Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
6 lb Chicken
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Pepper
9    Cloves garlic -- minced
1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
2 c  V-8  vegetable juice, no
Added salt
1    Lemon -- juice only
Remove giblet packages from the chicken and scatter giblets over the
bottom of a large roasting pan.  Remove visible fat from around the
cavity. Wash inside and out and pat dry.  Mix 1 teaspoon of the salt
with 1 teaspoon of the pepper and rub the mixture into the walls of
the cavity. Preheat the oven to 400.  Run your fingers under the skin
of the breast and legs, gently separating the skin from the meat
underneath.  Mix the minced garlic with the remaining salt and pepper
and 3 tbsp of the olive oil. Rub 3 tbsp of this garlic-oil mixture.
Place the chicken, breast side down, on top of the giblets, and roast
for 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 and turn the chicken
breast side up. Roast for 1 hour more. Pour the V-8 juice over the
chicken and continue roasting for 30 minutes more, basting with the
juice every 10 minutes, until the skin is golden brown.  Allow to
rest for 10 minutes before carving.  While the chicken is resting,
skim and discard as much fat as possible from the surface of the pan
juices.  Pour the skimmed juices into a large measuring cup.  Add the
lemon juice.  You should have at least 2 1/2 cups.  If not, add
enough V-8 juice to make 2 1/2 cups. Heat to a simmer.  Serve 1 1/2
cups fo the sauce with the chicken. Reserve 1/2 cup pan juices for
Ziti Fagiolini.
