Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
5 lb To 8 ham
1    Carrot, sliced
1    Onion, peeled
1 sm Bay leaf
Prepared mustard
1/3 c  Whole cloves
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Fine bread crumbs

Wipe ham with a damp cloth. Put in a large kettle, add carrot, onion
and bay leaf; cover with water. Bring to a boil and simmer until
tender. Let ham cool in water it was cooked in. Remove ham rind and
score the fat with criss-crosses. Spread with mustard and stick
cloves in score marks. Mix together the sugar and crumbs with a
little vinegar - press this in a thick layer all over the ham. Bake
slowly to brown.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
