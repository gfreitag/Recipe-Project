Title: Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri Mix And Recipes
Categories: Fruit, Beverages
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------FROZEN DAIQUIRI MIX-------------------------
2 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Lime juice*
1/4 c  Water
1 qt Fresh strawberries, hulled
MMMMM--------------------STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRIS-------------------------
3 tb Rum (light or dark)
Replace with unsweetened
Pineapple juice if desired
1/4 c  Frozen Daiquiri Mix
3/4 c  Ice cubes (7 or 8 avg)
MMMMM-------------------STRAWBERRY PINA COLADA------------------------
3 tb Rum (light or dark) optional
1/4 c  Frozen Daiquiri Mix
3 tb Unsweet Pineapple Juice
1 tb Coconut cream
3/4 c  Ice cubes (7 or 8 avg)
* Juice from 2 medium limes.

Combine sugar, lime juice and the water in a bowl. Stir to mix, and
then let stand until sugar is almost completely dissolved, about 15
minutes (mixture will be thick).

In a blender or food processer, combine sugar mixture with
strawberries. Blend until smooth. Pack into half-pint, pint, or quart
freezer containers; freeze. Alternatively, pour the mixture into
ice-cube trays and freeze until firm; unmold and pack into resealable
freezer bags.

The mixture will become solid, but will have the consistency of a
very firm sherbet, so you will be able to scoop portins from the main
batch, then reseal the container.

TO PREPARE STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRIS For each servings, combine 3
tablespoons rum in a blender container with 1/4 cup Frozen Strawberry
Daiquiri Mix (2 average size cubes of mix that have been frozen in
ice cube trays) and about 3/4 cup ice cubes (7 or 8 average size
cubes). Blend until smooth. Most blender jars can handle up to 4
servings. Replace the rum with unsweetened pineapple juice for
Nonalcoholic Strawberry Daiquiries.

STRAWBERRY PINA COLADA For each serving, combine 3 tablespoons rum in
a blender container with 1/4 cup Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri Mix (2
average size cubes of mix that have been frozen in ice cube trays) 3
tablespoons unsweetened pineapple juice, 1 tablespoon coconut cream
and about 3/4 cup ice cubes (7 or 8 average size cubes). Blend until
smooth. Omit the rum for a nonalcoholic version.
