Title: Potato Starter Sourdough Bread
Categories: Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Starter,
1/4 c  Sugar,
1/2 c  Safflower oil,
1 1/2 ts Salt,
1 1/2 c  Warm water,
6 c  Bread flour (or 2 cups bread
Flour and 4 cups
All-purpose)
Place the cup of starter in a bowl and add the sugar, oil, salt, warm
water, and flour one cup at a time, stirring after each cup of flour.
(If desired, 2 cups of the flour may be whole wheat.)  Mix dough well
with a heavy duty mixer, food processor, or by hand.  Turn the dough
out onto a floured board and knead well.  Place in a large oiled
bowl, oil the top of the dough, cover with plastic wrap and allow to
rise overnight.

The next morning, punch the dough down.  Knead on a floured board
about a minute.  Divide into 3 pieces and shape into loaes.  Place
into greased 8x4 inch greased loaf pans.  Cover with a towel and
allow to rise 6 to 8 hours on the counter.  Bake the loaves in a 325F
oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans.

Note - if the weather is very cold or rainy, add a packet of dry
yeast to the dough to ensure that it will rise.  (Connie Jobe)
