*Old Bay seasoning is a blend of celery salt, mustard, red pepper,
black pepper, bay, cloves, allspice, ginger, mace, cardamom, cinnamon
and paprika.  It is available on the spice aisle in most grocery
stores.

In a medium bowl, combine marinade ingredients and add shrimp, coating
well.  Cover the mixture and refrigerate for at least an hour.

Bring 6 quarts of cold water to a boil.  Add the shrimp mixture and
simmer for 3 minutes, or until shrimp turn an opaque pink.  Drain the
shrimp, place them in a bowl and set them, covered, in the
refrigerator.

In a large bowl, whisk together the dressing ingredients.  Add bell
peppers, cooked shrimp, salt and pepper; toss to coat well.  Cover and
refrigerate for at least 2 hours, stirring from time to time.  Just
before serving, stir in the mint.  Garnish with a few whole mint
leaves.

Kane and Dob write: "A refreshing, highly seasoned dish for a hot
summer night.  Serve chilled or at room temperature with lightly
steamed string beans tossed with basil, chopped garden tomatoes,
balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.  Extra mint?  Rub a few sprigs
between your hands after cleaning the shrimp."
