Title: Bow-Tie Gratin with Radicchio and Mushrooms
Categories: Side dish, Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Uncooked bow-tie pasta
2 ts Olive oil
5 oz Assorted mushrooms, sliced
1/4 lb Radicchio
-coarsely chopped
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
Preheat oven to 400F.

Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Leave the
pasta more al dente than usual because it will soften considerably
during baking. Drain and reserve.

Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over high heat. Add the
mushroom slices and saut, tossing frequently, until the mushrooms are
browned, 2-3 minutes.

Combine the cooked pasta, sauted mushrooms, radicchio, cream, salt and
pepper in a 6-cup gratin dish or shallow casserole. Stir to combine,
then sprinkle the Parmesan over the gratin.

Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the cream has thickened and the gratin
is browned on top. Serve immediately.
