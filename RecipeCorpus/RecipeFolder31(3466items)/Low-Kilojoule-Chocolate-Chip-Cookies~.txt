Grated flecks of chocolate replace the traditional chocolate chips in
this low kilojoule version of a favourite American Cookie.

1. Preheat the oven to 190oC.  In a small bowl, combine the plain
flour, wholemeal flour and bicarbonate of soda and put aside.

2. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the margarine, white
sugar and  brown sugar at moderately low speed for 2 minutes or until
smooth and creamy; then beat in the egg, egg white and vanilla
essence.

3. Using a wooden spoon, mix in the dry ingredients and the chocolate.

4. Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking trays,
spacing the biscuits about 5 cm apart.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or
until lightly browned around the edges.  Remove immediately to wire
racks to cool. Makes about 36 biscuits.
