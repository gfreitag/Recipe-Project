Title: Lemon Ice Cream Ii
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
3 lg Ripe lemons
3/4 c  Superfine sugar
5    Egg yolks
3 c  Half and half
1 ts Vanilla
Remove zest from lemons with a zester or vegetable peeler. Be careful
to remove only the yellow zest and not the bitter white pith. Place
the zest and sugar into a food processor fitted with the steel blade
or in blender, and process until the zest is finely ground and mixed.
Add 3 tablespoons of juice from the lemons to the jar and process
briefly. Set aside. Beat the egg yolks with a mixer until thick. Beat
in the lemon sugar. Heat 2 cups of the half and half in a saucepan
until almost simmering. Slowly add the other cup to the beaten yolks,
along with the vanilla. Add heated cream. Turn the mixture back into
the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until
thickened enough for the mixture to coat the back of a spoon. Remove
from heat and chill until cold. Freeze in ice cream freezer, according

to manufacturer's instructions.
