This recipe orignally appeared in The Carolina Housewife. The last
line in the recipe is taken verbatim from the orignal by the authors.

1   C Cooked hominy 2 T Butter 2 Eggs 1 C Milk 1/2 C Cornmeal 1/2 t
Salt

While hominy is hot, stir in the butter. Beat eggs until light and
add to hominy, then add milk. Stir in cornmeal and salt. This makes a
very thin batter. Pour into a deep, buttered pan and bake in a 375
degree F. oven for about 30 minutes (about 1 hour in a glass baking
dish). This will serve 6.

When baked, it has the appearance of a baked batter pudding, and when
rich and well mixed it has almost the delicacy of baked custard.
