Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
4 c  Chicken Broth
1 lg Walla Walla Sweet Onion,
Peeled and chopped
1 c  Garlic Chives, chopped
2 c  Russet Potato, peeled and
Chopped
1/2 c  Light Cream
1/2 ts White Pepper
1/2 c  Garlic Chives, chopped with
1/2 c  Walla Walla Sweet Onion,
Minced
1/2 c  Dry Sherry
In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, onion, garlic chives and
potato. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, covered,
until the potatoes are just tender, about 15-20 minutes. Remove from
heat and let cool slightly, then puree the mixture in a blender or
food processor until smooth (this will have to be done in several
batches. Return the pureed soup to the pot, stir in the light cream
and white pepper and gently reheat.

To serve, ladle a portion into each soup bowl. Garnish each serving
with a bit of the chopped garlic chives and Walla Walla Sweet onion.
Pour the sherry into a cruet or some other container for easy pouring
and serve with the soup at the table so guests can drizzle a bit on
if desired. This soup is also delicious chilled, and can be prepared
up to 24 hours in advance.
