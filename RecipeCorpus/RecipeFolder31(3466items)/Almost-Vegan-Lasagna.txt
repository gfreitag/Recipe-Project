Rinse lentils & cook for about 25 minutes until soft.  Drain,
reserving the stock.

Heat oil in a large skillet & saute onions for 3 minutes.  Add
carrots, garlic & mushrooms & continue to saute for 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Add cooked lentils,
tomatoes, tomato paste, herbs & soy sauce.  Add a little of the
reserved stock if mixture is too dry.  Cover & cook for 20 minutes to
ensure that the flavours are well blended.

Meanwhile cook enough lasagna strips to make 3 layers.  Cook only
till al dente.

BECHAMEL SAUCE: Combine the water, cashews, salt, pepper & nutmeg in
the blender & blend till smooth.  Make the roux by heating the oil in
a pot & stirring in the flour when hot.  Slowly add the cashew milk,
add the bay leaf & bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly.  When
boiling, reduce heat to very low & simmer for about 1 minute or until
the sauce starts to thicken.  Set aside.

Oil a casserole dish.  Put a layer of lasagna in the bottom & layer
with the lentil mixture followed by the bechamel sauce.  Repeat,
ending with a layer of bechamel.  Top with shredded soy cheese if
desired. Bake at 350F for 35 minutes.  Let stand for 10 minutes
before serving.
