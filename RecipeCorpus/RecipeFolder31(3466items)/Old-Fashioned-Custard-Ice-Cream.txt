Alex Patout says, "This ice cream is delicious plain, but for a
desert that is truly out of this world, try it with Old Dominion
Pound Cake - recipe follows). This recipe also makes an incomparable
base for fresh fruit ice creams. Beat together the eggs, sugar,
flour, and salt. Scald 1-1/2 quarts of the milk in a medium saucepan.
Beat a little of the hot milk into the egg-sugar mixture, then whisk
this mixture back into the rest of the milk and cook, stirring
constantly over medium-low heat until the custard has become very
thick--it should drop from a spoon in globs. Let the custard cool
completely, then chill it.
When you are ready to freeze the ice cream, blend the evaporated
milk into the custard and add the vanilla.  Pour into the cylinder of
an ice cream freezer and add enough of the remaining milk to reach
the fill line. Freeze according to the manufacturer's directions.
Makes 4-5 quarts FRESH PEACH OR STRAWBERRY ICR CREAM Prepare as
above, but reduce the sugar to 2 cups and add 1 quart crushed
strawberries or peaches to the ice cream instead of the additional
milk. If you are making peach ice cream, substitute 2 teaspoons
almond extract for thr vanilla. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home
