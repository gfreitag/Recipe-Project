Chris McDonald says this dessert is the mainstay on Avalon's dinner
menu, where it is billed as "VALRHONA MOLTEN CAPPUCCINO CAKE" (The
cappuccino part refers to the cups in which it was originally
served). It hails from New York, where Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten
of Jo-Jo and Vong restaurant fame imported the idea from native
France. A cross between a cake, a pudding and a souffle, this
mini-dessert is simply devine. Served straight from the oven, each
one is accompanied by expresso creme anglaise, some whipped cream and
a few chocolate-covered coffee beans. McDonald okayed my substitute
cheater's sauce, made by melting some good coffee ice cream in the
microwave. He uses Valrhona chocolate, but we had super results using
bittersweet Lindt. Practise this recipe a couple of times before
serving it to guests because the timing is tricky; you want a moist
outer cake and a runny middle. We used foil muffin cups. McDonald say
he lets the batter sit in fridge at least a day for cakier, less
souffle-ish version.
................................................................... 6
oz Bittersweet Chocolate(175g); finely choped 1/3 c Butter 3 lg Eggs
1/3 c Granulated Sugar 1/4 c Plus 2 tb. All-Purpose Flour Place
chocolate in double boiler or bowl over barely simmering water. Add
butter, stirring until melted and smooth. Cool slightly. In bowl,
beat eggs, egg yolks and sugar at least 5 minutes until pale yellow
and thickened. Gradually beat in flour. Pour in chocolate mixture.
Continue beating about 5 minutes or until thick and glossy. Divide
batter among 6 buttered, floured, 3-inch aluminum muffin cups.
Refrigerate at least half an hour or up to 3 days. Bake in preheated
325F oven about 15 to 20 minutes or until each little cake is just
set around the edges but still slighty runny in the center. Makes 6.
