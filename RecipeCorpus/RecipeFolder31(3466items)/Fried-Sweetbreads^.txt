Sweetbreads
1    Or 2 eggs, beaten

Soak sweetbreads in cold water for 2 hours. Clean and parboil them
for 15 minutes. Cook and slice, then dip in egg, then in cracker
crumbs and fry in butter. Season to taste. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
