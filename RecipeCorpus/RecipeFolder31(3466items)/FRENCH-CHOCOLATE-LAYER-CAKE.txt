Yield: 1 cake
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
2 ts Espresso coffee,
-instant
1/4 c  Water, hot
7 oz Chocolate, semisweet
2 oz Chocolate, bitter
4    Eggs, separated
4 oz Butter
2/3 c  Sugar

3/4 c  Cornstarch, sifted
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
2 ts Espresso coffee,
-instant
7 oz Chocolate, semisweet
2 oz Chocolate, bitter
2 tb Butter
Combine espresso, hot water, semisweet chocolate and bitter chocolate
in double boiler filled with hot water and cover.  Without applying
additional heat, melt the chocolate.

Butter two layer-cake pans, lay a sheet of waxed paper in each, and
dust the pans with flour. (The pans should be able to hold about 4
cups each.)

Beat the egg yolks and then gradually add about 2/3 cup of sugar
until the yolks are thick and lemon colored.

Beat butter into the chocolate mixture.  Add the chocolate mixture to
the egg yolks and stir.

Beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar, and then
gradually add up to 2 T sugar.

Add the sifted corn starch gradually to the chocolate mixture,
alternating with the egg whites.  The corn starch and egg whites
should be folded in to the chocolate mixture.

Pour half the batter into each cake pan.  Bake on the lower middle
level of a preheated 350 degree F. oven until set on the sides. Cool
the cake in the pan, and then turn out onto a serving dish.

Combine the icing ingredients and ice the cake as you would a normal
layer cake.

NOTES:

*  A decadently rich chocolate cake -- My mother got this recipe from
a radio show about ten years ago. She was intrigued because the cake
contains no flour. It is definitely for chocoholics. Although it is a
two-layer cake, it is only about 3-4 inches thick when it's done, and
has the consistency and density of a chocolate candy bar. It can be
frozen if you find it too much to eat at one time.

: Difficulty:  difficult.
