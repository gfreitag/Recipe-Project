Title: Hearty Stew
Categories: Soup/stew, Fatfree, Casseroles
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Garbanzo beans; dry
1/2 c  Kidney beans; dry
2 qt Water
1 lg Yellow onion; sliced
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
2 tb Soy sauce, low sodium
2 ts Curry powder
2    Parsnips; scrubbed & sliced
2    Carrot; scrubbed & sliced
1    Zucchini; cut in chunks
1/2 c  Whole-wheat macaroni
[uncooked?]
1/4 c  Bulgur; uncooked
1 tb Lemon juice
2 c  Fresh spinach
Preparation Time: 4:30 Soak both types of beans overnight in a pan
filled with water, just covering the beans.

Canned beans do not work in this dish. The cooking liquid from the dry
beans makes a rich, flavorful stock which makes for the base of the
stew.

Place the beans in a large pot with the water. Soak overnight, or
bring to a boil, cook for 2 minutes, turn off heat, and let rest for
1 hour. Then add the onion, garlic, soy sauce, and curry powder.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook for 2 hours. Meanwhile,
prepare the rest of the vegetables and set aside.

Place the parsnips in a small amount of water in a small saucepan.
Cook until soft, about 15 minutes. Cool. Place in a blender or food
processor and process until smooth. When beans are almost tender, add
the pureed parsnips and the carrots and zucchini. Cook for 30
minutes, then add the pasta and bulgur. Cook an additional 15
minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and spinach and cook about 5
minutes. Serve at once. From the recipe files of Sue Smith,
