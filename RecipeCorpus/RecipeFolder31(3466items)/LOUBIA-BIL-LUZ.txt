Title: LOUBIA BIL LUZ
Categories: Main dish, African, Vegetables, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Green beans, fresh
4 c  Water, salted
3 tb Peanut oil
1    Garlic clove, mashed
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 tb Almonds, slivered
Clean and trim green beans.  Simmer in lightly salted water until just
tender, about 30-45 minutes. Drain and put in serving dish.

Put remaining ingredients (except almonds) in a saucepan over medium
heat and cook for two minutes, stirring constantly. Add the almonds
and stir briefly to coat. Pour the oil mixture over the green beans
and toss gently until beans are thoroughly coated. Serve warm.

NOTES:

*  Algerian green beans with almonds -- This is a variation on an
Algerian recipe from Rose Dosti's "Middle Eastern Cooking."  Since
when is North Africa in the Middle East? You may well ask.

*  Canned green beans are not an acceptable substitute in this recipe.
Powdered garlic is probably OK.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 50 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
