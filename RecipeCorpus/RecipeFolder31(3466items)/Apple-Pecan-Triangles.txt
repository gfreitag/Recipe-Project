Title: Apple Pecan Triangles
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
4    Granny Smith apples (or
-Pippin)
1/2 c  Soy margarine
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Currants
1/4 c  Pecans, chopped
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 c  Sugar (optional amount,
-depends upon personal taste
-and apple sweetness)
1 pk Filo pastry dough
1/4 c  Cinnamon-sugar mixture
Peel and core the apples and cut into small dice.

Melt 3 Tbsp of margarine in a heavy saucepan, add the apples and
saute 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add the lemon juice, currants, pecans, and spices and saute for
another 3-4 minutes.

Taste mixture and add sugar.  Set aside to cool.

Melt the remaining margarine.

Cut a 2" strip off the rolled filo dough.

Cover the remainder with a towel and roll out the cut strip.

Remove 2 pieces of the cut dough at a time and place on the cutting
board.

Brush the top piece with margarine and place about a teaspoon of the
apple mixture in the lower right hand corner of the filo.

Fold the filo into a small triangle, much like a flag is folded, from
corner to corner, or roll like a burrito.

Place the triangles on a baking sheet, brush the top with a little
margarine, and sprinkle with a small amount of cinnamon sugar.

Repeat the process until all the filo has been used.

Bake in a 375 F oven until the triangles are just golden, about 25
minutes.
