=================> Notes and Credits <===================== "This is
Grandma Bondi's recipe. Fresh peas are the best to use, but when they
are out of season, use frozen peas. Also regular potatoes can be used
instead of new potatoes. This can be used with any meat entree as
your vegetable and potato dish. Very easy to make." Dorothy's note: A
collection of recipes tested in the kitchen of Jo Parodi in a
cookbook created with love for her family and friends. A colleague
has allowed me to borrow his mother's present to him, and lucky for
us, Mrs. Parodi has given her permission for me to post some of the
family recipes from her 1973 cookbook. Typed by Dorothy Hair 6/94
