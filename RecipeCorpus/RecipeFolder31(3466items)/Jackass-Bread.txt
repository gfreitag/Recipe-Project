soda thoroughly. Mix in flour till it won't take any more or if using
a mixer till you have a clean bowl.  Knead for 5 minutes. Put in
greased bowl covered with a cloth or plastic wrap in a warm place to
rise till double. Punch down, knead again for 3 minutes and put into
a wll oiled 8 inch dutch oven (about half full), oil top of dough and
place lid loosely on pot. Let rise to top of kettle.  Bake covered in
375 oven for 30 minutes, then turn down to 325, bake 40 minutes more.
Turn out on rack, butter top and sides, cover with cloth and let
cool.  Cut in quarters after cooling.  Instead of dutch oven use 4
one pound loaf pans.  (NOTE: If cooking in a hole in the ground let
bake 5 - 6 hours.)
