Title: Neysa's Banana Nut Bread
Categories: Breads, Fruit
Yield: 3 loaves
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Crisco
4    Eggs
4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Buttermilk
6    Ripe bananas, mashed
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Broken walnuts
Cream crisco and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time. Beat until fluffy.
Mix salt, soda and baking powder with flour. Mash bananas and add
buttermilk and vanilla.

Mix dry ingredients alternately with wet ingredients into
sugar/egg/crisco mixture. Add walnuts.

Grease and flour three foil loaf pans and divide batter into them.

Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. After it has cooled to touch, put
each loaf in a 1 gallon zip lock bag. This will soften the crust.
Don't zip the bag until the bread is cool.

* I put my walnuts in a gallon bag and roll them with a rolling pin.
