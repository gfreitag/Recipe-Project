Title: Jezebel Sauce 2
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
10 oz Jar pineapple preserves
10 oz Jar apple jelly
1 1/2 oz Dry mustard
5 oz Jar horseradish
8 oz Cream cheese (optional)
This is the recipe for jezabel sauce that has been in my family for
years...Certain holiday celebrations are incomplete without it!  It
keeps indefinitely in the fridge in a covered container and at a
cocktail buffet, served on the side (without the cream cheese) with
ham/turkey/or raost beef and bread rounds....The men adore it!! Mix
together preserves, jelly, mustard and horseradish.  If using as a
sauce, store in fridge in covered container.....As a spread, spread
over block of cream cheese and serve with crackers.
