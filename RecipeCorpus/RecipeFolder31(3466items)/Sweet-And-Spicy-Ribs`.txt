Categories: Cowboy, Main dish, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Chili Powder
1/3 c  Packed Brown Sugar
1 ts Salt
5 lb Pork Spareribs -- cut in 3
-or 4 slabs
1 c  Mesquite Chips, Soaked 30
-Mins And Drained
1. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, brown sugar, and salt.
Rub the ribs all over the mixture and wrap each slab in a double
thickness of aluminum foil. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hr or
refrigerate for up to 1 day.

2. Make a medium-hot fire in charcoal grill.

3. Place the foil packets on a lightly oiled grill. Cover and cook,
turning often with kitchen tongs (don't pierce the foil), until the
ribs are just tender, about 1 hr. Carefully unwrap the ribs,
discarding the liquid in the foil. Add more hot coals to the grill
and sprinkle with the mesquite chips. Cover the grill and cook the
ribs, turning often, until they are browned, about 10 mins. Cut the
ribs between the bones and serve immediately.

NOTE: To cook the ribs on a gas grill, preheat the grill, then turn to
low. Cook the ribs in foil for 1 hr, then unwrap. Wrap the soaked
chips in heavy-duty aluminum foil and pierce the foil all over. Place
the packet directly onto the heating unit or lava rocks. Cover and
cook the ribs until tender, about 15 additional mins.

Makes 6 servings from Tom Christian of Figure 3 Ranch of Claude, TX.
