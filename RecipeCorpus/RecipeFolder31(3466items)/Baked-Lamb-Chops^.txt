Slice potatoes and lay in a flat, open baking dish. Put the onion,
salt and pepper on top. Cover with cold water and put lamb chops on
top of that, with a little more salt. Bake at 350F for about 1 1/4
hours. Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts
or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the
book, typos and all.
