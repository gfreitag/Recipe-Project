Title: CHOCOLATE BROWN SUGAR COOKIES
Categories: Cake/cookie, Usenet
Yield: 3 dozen
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 lb Butter
1/3 c  Honey
1 lg Egg
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
Flour (1.1 C --> glass
-measuring cup filled
-to the top)
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 c  Chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the
brown sugar, add egg and vanilla. Mix well. Add honey.

Measure flour and baking soda (I usually just mix the soda in with the
flour.) Add flour and soda to batter a little at a time and mix. Add
chocolate chips.

Drop by spoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 5-8
minutes at 375 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate chip cookies with honey and brown sugar.

*  For those of you who like your cookies warm!  I always make up only
enough to eat, and store the batter in the fridge.

*  You can substitute margarine for the butter if you want.

: Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
processor is tedious.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
