Title: Carolina Moravian Ginger Thins
Categories: Tasteofhome, Cake/cookie
Yield: 80 cookies
5 tb Light molasses
1/3 c  Water
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2/3 c  Light brown sugar; not too
-firmly packed
2/3 c  Butter
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground allspice or cloves
1 1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
2 3/4 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
Combine the molasses, water, and granulated and brown sugars in a
saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and add the butter. Allow
the butter to melt while stirring the mixture, then remove the pan
from the heat and set it aside to cool.
When the mixture is cool, pour it into the bowl of an electric
mixer. Add the slat, spices, and baking powder. Blend well. Add the
flour and mix thoroughly, but do notoverbeat. Cover the dough and
refrigerate until it is easy to handle, several hours.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it for
about 2 minutes. Then roll it out 1/8 inch thick (this makes a thin,
crisp cookie). Using a plain or scalloped 2-inch cutter, cut the
cookie out and place them on a white or light gray nonstick baking
sheet.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. They must not brown the least bit.
Leave the cookies in the oven to dry out, 10 to 15 minutes. Then cool
them on racks, and store in a tight tin.
