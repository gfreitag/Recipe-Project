MMMMM----------------ROAST VIDALIA ONION FLOWERS---------------------
6 lg Onions, Vidalia; (3 1/2 lb)
6 tb Butter, unsalted; melted
1/4 c  Nuts, Pecans; chopped
=========================== > Directions < ==========================

With a sharp knife, trim the root end of each onion on its root end,
cut parallel vertical slices at 1/4 inch intervals into but not
through the onion, stopping about 1/2 inch above the root end. Rotate
each onion 90 degrees and cut parallel vertical slices in the same
manner to from a crosshatch pattern, keeping the onions intact.
Arrange the onions, root ends down, in a lightly buttered shallow
baking dish large enough to let the onion open or "flower," drizzle
them with the butter, and season them with salt and pepper. Bake the
onions in the middle of a preheated 350 degree F oven, basting them
occasionally, for 1 hour, sprinkle them with the pecans, and bake
them for 30 minutes more.
