It is important to use a 'food mill' here--if pureed in a food
processor, the cooked red pepper must be strained afterward to remove
the skin.

Bring 8 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, prepare
the sauce. For the Red Pepper Sauce: Place the red pepper pieces in a
saucepan with 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, cover, and boil gently
for 10 minutes. Push the peppers and their cooking liquid through a
food mill fitted with a fine screen.  (You should have 1+3/4 cups.)
Crush the garlic with the flat side of a knife, chop it into a fine
puree, and add it to the red pepper mixture with the 3/4 teaspoon
black pepper, and 3 tablespoons olive oil. Stir well with a whisk and
set aside in the pan. Add the linguini to the boiling water and cook
it for about 8 minutes, until tender but still firm. Meanwhile, heat
the 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet. When it is hot, add the
onion and walnut pieces and saute' over medium heat for about 2
minutes, until the onion begins to brown.  Transfer the mixture to
the bowl in which you will serve the linguini, and stir in the 1/2
teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and parsley. Add 1/2 cup of
the pasta-cooking liquid to the onions and walnuts in the bowl.  Then
drain the linguini in a colander.  Place the drained linguini in the
serving bowl and mix well. Bring the red pepper sauce to a boil and
divide it among four large plates. Mound the linguini in the center
of each plate, sprinkle with the cheese, if using, and serve
immediately.
