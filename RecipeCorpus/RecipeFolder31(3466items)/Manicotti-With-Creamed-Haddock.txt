Title: Manicotti With Creamed Haddock
Categories: Pasta, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Smoked haddock fillet
2 1/2 c  Milk
2    Bay leaves
12    Manicotti tubes
6 tb Heavy cream
Salt and black pepper
4 tb Unsalted butter
4 tb All-purpose flour
1 c  Grated Cheddar cheese
Wash and dry the haddock; put it in a wide pan with the milk and bay
leaves.  Bring the milk slowly to a simmer and poach the haddock over
low heat for about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, lift
out the haddock with a slotted spoon, and leave to cool.  Strain the
milk through a fine sieve and set it aside to cool.

Bring a large pan of water to a boil, add 2 teaspoons salt and the
manicotti.  Boil, uncovered, for about fifteen minutes or until the
pasta is just tender.  Drain the manicotti in a colander and rinse
under cold water.  Leave it to drain completely on layers of paper
towels.

While the manicotti is cooking, remove the skin and bones from the
haddock and flake the flesh into a bowl.  Pound with a pestle or mash
with a fork until smooth, and gradually work in the cream.  Season to
taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Fit a pastry bag with a plain tube, fill it with haddock mixture, and
pipe it into the manicotti tubes.  Arrange the tubes in one layer in
an ovenproof dish greased with 1 tablespoon of butter.

Make a thick white sauce from the remaining butter, the flour, and
strained milk.  Stir 3/4 cup of the grated cheese into the sauce.
Cook for a few minutes over low heat, then pour it over the manicotti.

Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the sauce and put the dish in a
preheated oven at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes, or until the cheese is
bubbly and golden brown on top.

Serve the manicotti in the sauce while still hot.
