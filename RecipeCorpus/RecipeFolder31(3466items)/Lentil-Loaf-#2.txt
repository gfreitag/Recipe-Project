Preheat oven to 350. In large bowl, mix cooked lentils, cooked
bulgur, and remainder of ingredients. Mix it all up and put it into a
sprayed loaf pan, casserole dish, or whatever. Bake for about 40 min.
The oringinal recipe said to slice and serve, but I find it comes out
more of a scoop-and-serve consistency.

next time I make it, I'm going to try adding some cooked carrots and
potatoes, and maybe some peas.  Might add some nice color and
textures.
