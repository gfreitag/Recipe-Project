Yield: 1 servings
8    Country style spareribs
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Catsup
1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Chili powder
2 ds Tabasco sauce
1 1/2 c  Water
1    Thinly sliced lemon

Salt ribs and place in shallow roasting pan, meaty side up. Roast at
450 degrees for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a sauce pan combine catsup, worcestershire sauce, chili,
tabasco sauce and water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 3 minutes.

Drain off excess fat from meat. Top each piece with lemon and onion
slices. Pour sauce over ribs and return to oven. Cook at 350 degrees
until ribs are well done, about 1 hour. Baste with sauce about every
15 minutes. Thin sauce with water if it gets too thick.

For chicken, total baking time is 1 hour at 350 degrees. For barbecue,
brush sauce on ribs every 15 minutes after turning.
