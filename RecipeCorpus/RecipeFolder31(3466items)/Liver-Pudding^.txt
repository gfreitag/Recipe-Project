Title: Liver Pudding^
Categories: Meats, Puddings, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Liver
1 c  Rice
Milk
1    Onion, chopped
Lard
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Corn syrup
1 c  Raisins
2    Eggs, beaten
Cook and chop up liver. Cook rice in milk. Fry onion in lard, add
liver, rice, salt and pepper. Stir in syrup, raisins and eggs. Bake
in a moderate oven for about an hour. This makes a large pudding and
it's not too bad. Even if you don't like liver, you may just like
this. Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts
or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the
book, typos and all.
