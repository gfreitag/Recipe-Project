Title: Basic Salad Dressing~
Categories: Diabetic, Salads
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 tb Acceptable vegetable oil
4 tb Water
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/8 ts Garlic powder
1/8 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
In  jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine all ingredients.  Shake
well and refrigerate. Makes 1/2 cup. (Half of published recipe.)

My note: I frequently use bottled lemon juice which has sodium
listed, but there can't be much sodium in 1/2 tsp. divided among 8
servings. If you use fresh lemon juice, extra can be frozen in an ice
cube tray or small container.

1 tbsp - 31 cal 3 grams total fat, 5 mg potassium, 0 cholesterol, 0
sodium.
