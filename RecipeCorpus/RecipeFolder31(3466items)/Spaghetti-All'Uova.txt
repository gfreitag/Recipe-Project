Title: Spaghetti All'Uova
Categories: Pasta, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 lb Spaghetti
Salt
3 oz Romano or Parmesan cheese
6    Eggs
1/2 lb Butter
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to the boil, add the
spaghetti, and cook, uncovered, for 10-12 minutes or until al dente.

Meanwhile, grate the cheese into a serving bowl.  Break the eggs into
a large bowl and beat them lightly with a fork.  Put half the butter
on a serving dish and cut the remainder into small pieces.

Drain the cooked spaghetti in a colander and put it into a large hot
serving bowl.  Stir in the eggs quickly, tossing the spaghetti and
eggs thoroughly with two spoons until the eggs have set.

Dot the spaghetti and egg mixture with the pieces of butter and serve
at once.  Serve on the side the grated cheese and remaining butter.
