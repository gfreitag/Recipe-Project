Title: Crisp Quesadillas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------FROM: KATHY PITTS--------------------------
Flour tortillas (the
-biggest, thinnest ones you
-can find)
Oil for frying
Shredded cheddar, jack or
-jalapeno cheese (or a
-mixture)
Salsa for spooning on the
-above
Heat the oil in a large
-skillet (it should be at
-least 1/4 inch deep).
When the oil is very hot,
-but not smoking, place a
-flour tortilla in
It. It will almost
-immediately puff up
-slightly and begin to
-brown.
Turn and cook the other
-side, and when the
-tortilla is quite crisp,
Remove from the oil, and
-drain on paper towels.
-This may be done
Several hours in advance,
-if necessary.
At serving time, top the
-tortilla with a generous
-handful of grated
Cheese, and pop it under
-the broiler until the
-cheese is just melted
(this will only take a
-couple of minutes).
To eat this, everyone breaks off a hunk, tops it with a little hot
sauce or salsa, and eats.  I normally allow one 8-inch tortilla per
person, or 1 12-14 inch tortilla for 2 people.
