1 pk Active dry yeast
2 1/2 c  Warm water
2 c  Sifted flour
1 tb Sugar
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup of the warm water in a deep glass or
plastic container.  Stir in remaining warm water, flour and sugar.
Beat until smooth.  Cover with loose fitting cover. DO NOT
REFRIGERATE! The starter requires 10 days for fermentation as follows:

DAYS 1, 2, 3 and 4:... Stir batter
DAY 5:................ Add 1 cup each milk, flour, sugar and stir
DAYS 6, 7, and 8:..... Stir batter each day
DAY 10: ............. Add 1 cup each flour, sugar, milk; stir.

The batter is ready to use.

This makes 3 cups batter to use in the recipes. If you want to you
may pour 1 cup batter each into 3 containers and give 1 or 2 away.

Save 1 cup to begin process all over again OR you can use all 3 cups
batter for the recipes at 1 time and when you want to bake these
again just start the starter again.
