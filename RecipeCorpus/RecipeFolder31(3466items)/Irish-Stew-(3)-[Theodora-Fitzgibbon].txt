Trim the meat of bone, fat and gristle, then cut into fairly large
pieces. Layer the meat and the vegetables in a deep pan, seasoning
each layer well, and ending with potatoes.  Pour in the stock and
cover with a piece of buttered foil, then the lid, and bake in a slow
oven, 300F, for about 2 hours. Or, if preferred, on the top of the
stove, shaking the pan from time to time to prevent sticking. Add a
very little more liquid if needed.
