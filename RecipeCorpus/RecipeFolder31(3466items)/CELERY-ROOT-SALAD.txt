Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD
Categories: Salads, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Celery root
-(also called celeriac)
4 c  Water (salted), boiling
6 tb Olive oil
3 tb White wine vinegar
1 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
1 1/4 ts Mustard,  dry
1/2 ts Black pepper,
-freshly ground
1    Garlic clove, crushed
3/4 ts Dill weed, dried
-(use more if fresh)
1/3 c  Scallions, minced
1/3 c  Parsley, minced
Peel the celery root and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes.  Add the cubed
celery root to the boiling salted water and cook until tender, about
15 minutes. Drain.

Combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk or shake to make a
dressing. Pour the dressing over the cooked celery root and toss.
Refrigerate at least two hours before serving.

Celery root (also called celeriac) is sometimes hard to find.  Try to
get ones about the size of a large fist; smaller ones have too much
waste, and bigger ones are often pithy. This vegetable is not worth
eating raw.

NOTES:

*  Cooked celery root in vinaigrette -- This salad has an intense
celery flavor.  The taste is so strong that it should be served only
with other strongly flavored foods.  It would overwhelm veal, but
would go well with a lamb roast.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
