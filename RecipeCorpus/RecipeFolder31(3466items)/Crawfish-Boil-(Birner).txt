Title: Crawfish Boil (Birner)
Categories: Cajun/creol, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
Ah, well. Why wait. I looked
Up the recipes which we
Basically modify to
Taste and mood and weather.
We tend to prefer more lemon
Garlic and onion
And a bit less cayenne.
When I add corn I like to
See yellow not red on my
Plate.
This recipe is extremely hot
With cayenne. But he does
Mean it.
The crawfish boil is the premier social event in the spring time here
in Louisiana.  Friends and family gather for an afternoon under the
shade of an oak tree to enjoy a delicacy unequaled in the Southland.

30 quarts cold water 12 medium onions, quartered 6 heads of garlic,
split in half exposing pods 1 dozen lemons, quartered 1 quart cooking
oil 4 pounds salt 1/2 pound cayenne pepper 4 3-ounce bags crab boil
24 medium red potatoes 12 ears of corn 50 lbs cleaned crawfish

Live crawfish may be purchased already washed from your seafood
supplier. However, a second rinsing in cold water would not hurt. The
purging of crawfish, that is, washing the crawfish in cold salted
water, has been found to be useless other than to place the animal
under unnecessary stress. So forget the purging - rinsing in cold
water will suffice. In a sixty quart stockpot, bring water to a
rolling boil. Add onions, garlic, lemons, cooking oil, salt, pepper
and crab boil and continue to boil for thirty minutes. This boiling
of the vegetables will ensure a good flavor in the boiling liquid.
Add red potatoes and cook approximately ten to twelve minutes. Add
corn and cook ten minutes before adding the crawfish. Once the water
returns to a boil, cook crawfish seven to ten minutes, turn off heat
and allow to set in boiling liquid twelve additional minutes.
Crawfish should be served hot with potatoes and corn and pitchers of
ice cold beer. Bon Appetit
