Title: APRICOT CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Chicken pieces
1 pk French onion soup mix
2 c  Apricot nectar
1 1/2 lb Apricot halves (canned)
Flour (plain)
Dust chicken in flour.  Fry chicken lightly until starting to brown.
Place chicken in a casserole dish or a very deep frying pan.  Add
soup powder, nectar and apricots.  Mix everything well.  Simmer for 1
hour.

I normally use 2 pieces of chicken per person and about a 1 1/2 lb
can of apricot halves.  This will suffice for 4 to 6 people.  If you
cannot get nectar, then use the juice from the apricot halves.  (Of
course, if you can buy apricots in nectar...)

The French onion soup quantity is not critical, but a soup packet that
makes up about 6 C is about right for 4 to 6 people. Serve with potato
(baked or boiled), buttered carrots and peas.

NOTES:

*  Chicken embalmed in apricot nectar -- Apricot Chicken is the
ultimate bachelors delight.  It is very simple and tastes wonderful.
