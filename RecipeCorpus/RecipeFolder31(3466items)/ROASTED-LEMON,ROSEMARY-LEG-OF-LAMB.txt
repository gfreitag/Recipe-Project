Title: ROASTED LEMON/ROSEMARY LEG OF LAMB
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
8 lb Leg of lamb (approx)
2    Garlic cloves, slivered
3 tb Lemon juice (or less)
1 ts Rosemary, crumbled
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Butter (or margarine)
Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 1 hour before roasting.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Trim all but a thin layer of far from the lamb, and make small slits
over the surface of the meat. Insert the slivered garlic into these
slits. Brush the lamb with lemon juice, and rub rosemary, salt and
pepper into the meat.

Place the lamb, fat side up, on a roasting rack in a large, shallow
roasting pan. Roast at 350 degrees F. for 1 1/2 hours, or until a
properly-placed meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F. for rare, 150
for medium, or 160 for well- done. Carve and serve.
