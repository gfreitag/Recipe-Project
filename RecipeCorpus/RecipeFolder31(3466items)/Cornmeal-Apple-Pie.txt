"One of my favorite books about food is `Clarisse, or the Old Cook.'
A very small book, almost 100 years old, it propounds the reflections
and prejudices of `Clarisse,' the Chinese cook of an English
aristocrat. There is a small note in the front of the book that
reads: `This book is by a French connoisseur who wished to remain
anonymous.'"
