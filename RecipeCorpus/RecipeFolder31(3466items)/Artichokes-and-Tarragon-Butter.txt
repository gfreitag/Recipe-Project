Globe Artichokes are delicious when you pull the leaves off and dip
them in this herby butter. Preparing the artichokes too, is easy -
just follow the step by step instructions.

Preparation Time: 10 minutes Cooking Time: 30-40 minutes

Serving Suggestion: Serve each person with their own pot of tarragon
butter to dip the leaves in, and a side plate for the debris.
Alternatively try serving the artichokes cold with a french dressing,
or mayonnaise with a stiffly beaten egg white added.

Preparation:

Crush the garlic cloves and chop the fresh tarragon.

1. Hold the artichokes firmly and cut off the stalks together with the
first 12mm in from the bottom of the artichoke.

2. Turn the artichokes round, hold firmly and slice off the top 12mm
in of the leaves. Snip away the points from the lower leaves.

3. Tie two lemon slices firmly to the bottom of each of the
artichokes with string (this prevents the artichokes from
discolouring).

4. Place in a large saucepan of salted water, bring to the boil,
cover and cook for 30-40 minutes or until aleaf comes away easily if
pulled. Remove the lemon and drain the artichoke upside down for 1
minute. Place on a serving dish and garnish with remaining lemon
slices and tarragon sprigs.

5. Meanwhile make the tarragon butter: melt the butter over a low
heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Pour into a serving
bowl and stir in the chopped fresh tarragon. Serve with the
artichokes. Submitted By KAZ LANGRIDGE   On   05-21-95
