Aurora is the rosy glow that just precedes the dawn. It is the tomato
concentrate in this cream sauce that gives its warm hue.

Melt the 2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter in a heavy saucepan over medium
heat. Add 1 Tablespoon All Purpose Flour and stirring occasionally,
cook until frothy, but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups Whole
Milk a little at a time, stirring constantly. Simmer gently for 10
minutes. Just before serving, whisk in the 2 Tablespoons Tomato
Concentrate and season with Salt and Freshly ground White Pepper to
taste. Formatted by Olivia Liebermann.
