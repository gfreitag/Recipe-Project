Remove any bits from inside dressed bird. Singe and remove
pinfeathers. Wash under faucet. Dry inside and out. Stuff with a
light hand with dressing of your choice. Turn wings across back, sew
through wings and body with poultry needle and fine twine. Tie
firmly, leaving long ends. Press thighs close to body and sew
through; wrap twine around lower part of body and tie. Sew through
ends of legs and tie close together. Sew once or twice through body
opening if ragged. Rub with soft butter. Season well with salt and
pepper. Mix about 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup water in a pan and keep
hot for basting. Put bird on a rack in roasting pan. Sear in a hot
oven till browned, then reduce heat to moderate and bake until done,
basting often. Make gravy from pan drippings. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
