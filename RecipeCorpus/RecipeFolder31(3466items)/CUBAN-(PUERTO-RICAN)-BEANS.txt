Title: CUBAN (PUERTO RICAN) BEANS
Categories: Vegetables, Caribbean, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Beans, dried
1    Onion, diced
1/4    Green pepper, diced
3    Garlic cloves, diced
8 oz Tomato sauce
2 tb Olive oil
2 ts Salt  (You can
-vary the amount
-of salt according to
-preference.  My mother
-uses about 1 T )
MMMMM---------------------RICE TO GO WITH IT--------------------------
1 ts Salt (You can
-vary the amount of salt
-according to preference)
2 c  Water
1 c  Rice, long-grain
PREPARE BEANS:  Soak the beans for at least two hours (overnight is
okay too). Change the water and bring to a boil. Add the onion,
pepper and garlic; cover and simmer for 1 hour.

Add the tomato sauce, olive oil and salt:  cover and simmer 1 more
hour. (Be sure to keep the beans covered with liquid, adding more
water if necessary.)

PREPARE RICE:  Bring the water to a boil.  Add the rice and salt.
Cover and let simmer for 20 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Beans like they cook in many Caribbean countries -- This recipe is
from my mother, who undoubtedly got it from one of my father's
relatives. I've seen it described as being from various countries,
but it will always be Puerto Rican beans to me.

Any dried beans can be used, but kidney beans and navy beans are the
best. Chick peas aren't bad either.  You can use a ham bone for
flavoring instead of the olive oil if you don't mind using ham.
Yield: Serves 4.

*  This makes a very good main course or side dish.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  2 hours soaking, 5 minutes dicing, 2 hours cooking.
: Precision:  the rice is the only part you need to measure.
