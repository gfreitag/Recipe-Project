Title: Carmelized Garlic Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Pure olive oil
1 lg Bulb garlic -- roughly
Chopped
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1 1/2 c  Demi-glace
Madeira wine to taste
1 1/2 ts Sweet butter
Heat a saucepan; add oil and when it quivers, add garlic, cooking
until it's the color of straw, a very bright brown; pour garlic and
oil through a fine meshstrainer to stop cooking; wipe pan; add
chicken stock, demi-glace and cooked garlic; reduce to desired
consistency; add Madeira; add butter to the front of the pan, tilt
pan and shake to blend as the butter melts.

Notes:  Sauce should be nape; ie., just barely coat the back of the
spoon; if the sauce collects around the edge of the spoon before
dripping off, it is too thin. The garlic oil can be used to saute
chicken breast filets which are then drizzled with the garlic sauce.
This is an excellent sauce for chicken, veal, pork or beef.
