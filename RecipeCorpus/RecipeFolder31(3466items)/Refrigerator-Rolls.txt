Title: Refrigerator Rolls
Categories: Breads
Yield: 36 servings
1 c  White Potatoes -- mashed
2/3 c  Solid Vegetable Shortening
1 1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Sugar
2    Eggs -- beaten
1    Yeast Cake -- OR
2 pk Active Dry Yeast (1/4 Oz
Pkgs)
1/2 c  Lukewarm Water
1 c  Scalded Milk -- cooled to
Lukewarm
6 c  (To 8) All-Purpose Flour --
Sifted
Butter -- melted
While mashed potatoes are still warm, add shortening, salt, and sugar.
Cream well, then beat in eggs. Dissolve yeast in the lukewarm water.
Stir lukewarm milk into potato mixture, then add yeast. Add enough
sifted flour to make a stiff dough. Place on a floured board and
knead well. Then place in a large greased bowl and let rise until
double in bulk. Knead slightly on a floured board. Place back in the
bowl and rub top with melted butter.

Cover tightly and place in refrigerator until ready to use (will keep
for 5 to 6 days, supplying you with fresh rolls for a week). About 1
1/2 hrs before baking time, pinch off desired amount of dough and
either shape into cloverleaf or pocketbook rolls.

To make cloverleaf rolls, for 1-inch balls and place 3 in each cup of
a well-oiled muffin tin.

To make pocketbooks, roll out a portion of the dough to 1/4-inch
thickness. Cut with biscuit cutter and brush with melted butter. With
a knife make an indentation across each roll just left or right of
center. Fold the smaller half almost to the edge of the lower and
pinch together. Place in a greased pan.

Cover rolls with a towel and let them rise in a warm place for about
1 1/2 hrs, or until they double in size. Preheat oven to 400 F. Brush
rolls with melted butter. Bake for 15 to 20 mins or until nicely
browned.

Yield: 3 dozen rolls.
