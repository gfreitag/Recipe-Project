Title: Pate Maison Russell
Categories: Appetizers, Poultry, Dips/spread
Yield: 35 servings
2 lb Chicken livers
1/4 lb Butter
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/8 ts Oregano
1/8 ts Basil
1 ts Prepared mustard
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
5 ds Tabasco
5 tb Brandy
Wash livers in cold water, remove fat and veins.  Melt butter in large
skillet; add olive oil and heat together until bubbling.  Add next six
ingredients; mix well and add livers.  Cover and saute over medium
heat until done (livers are done when not reddish when cut).  Stir
occasionally while cooking; if pan dries add 2 to 3 tablespoons warm
water. Transfer livers to Foley Food Mill or sieve and mash into
mixing bowl. Add pan drippings and brandy.  Beat until smooth and
creamy paste (about 10 to 15 minutes).  If mixture appears dry and
crumbly, add more brandy. Pack in small jars and chill overnight.
Serve on toast rounds, saltines, or wheat crackers.  Good on celery
sticks. Serves 30 to 40 as a cocktail party item. Does not freeze
well, but will keep approximately two weeks in refrigerator.
