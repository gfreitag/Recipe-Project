Title: Abbacchio Alla Romana (Baked Lamb Roman Style)
Categories: Italian, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 kg Leg of young lamb
2    Rosemary sprigs
Salt
Black Pepper; freshly ground
50 g  Butter or lard
4 lg Potatoes
4 tb Dry white wine (optional)
Preheat the oven to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Peel the potatoes and cut
them into chunks. Sprinkle the lamb with rosemary leaves, or make
small incicions all over the meat and push a few rosemary leaves into
each one. Season with salt and pepper. In a heavy, heatproof
casserole, brown the lamb on all sides in the butter or lard.
Surround it with the potatoes. Bake for about 1 hour, or  until
tender. Turn the lamb and the potatoes occasionally so that they
brown evenly. If necessary baste the lamb with a little white wine to
prevent it browning too quickly. Transfer the lamb to a heated
serving dish and surround it withthe potatoes.

"The "abbacchio" which is served in Italy at Easter time is milk-fed
baby lamb, so young and small that a leg will serve no more than 4
people. Baby lamb is almost impossible to find in Britain or the
United States, but this method can be used to cook older lamb with
excellent results."
