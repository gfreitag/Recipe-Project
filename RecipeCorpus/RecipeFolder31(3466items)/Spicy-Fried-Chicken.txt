Title: Spicy Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1    Frying chicken (2 1/2-to-3
-lb), cut into serving
-pieces
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Black pepper
1/4 ts Poultry seasoning
1/2 c  Milk
1    Egg, lightly beaten
Shortening or oil for frying
RINSE CHICKEN PIECES under cold running water, and pat dry on paper
towels. In a paper or heavy plastic bag, mix the flour with the salt,
garlic powder, paprika, pepper and poultry seasoning. Mix milk with
egg in a shallow bowl. Shake a few chicken pieces at a time in the
bag of seasoned flour. Roll them in the egg mixture, and then shake
them again in the flour. Allow them to sit for 10 minutes so the
flour will adhere to the pieces. To pan fry, melt shortening or pour
oil in a heavy, deep-sided skillet to a depth of 1/2 to 1 inch. Heat
to 365F. Add the chicken pieces, being careful not to crowd the pan,
and brown the chicken on all sides. Reduce heat to 275 F and continue
to cook until the chicken is tender. It will take about 30 minutes
for white meat and 40 minutes for dark meat. Turn several times
during the cooking using tongs, and drain on paper towels. To deep
fry, heat shortening or oil in a deep fryer to 365F. Cook chicken for
15 minutes for white meat and 18 minutes for dark meat. Drain on
paper towels, and serve immediately. Serves 4.
