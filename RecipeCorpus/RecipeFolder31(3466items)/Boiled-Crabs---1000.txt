Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Fish
Yield: 4 servings
2 ea Lemons, quartered
4 ea Small ears fresh corn
1 c  Salt
1/2 c  Ground white pepper
12 ea Live blue crabs
8 ea New red potatoes
4 ea Small yellow onions
1/2 c  Ground red pepper
1/2 c  Ground black pepper
Fill a large (10-quart) stockpot one-third full with water. Add the
lemons, potatoes, corn, onions, salt, and peppers. Cover and bring to
a boil over high heat.  Let boil for 10 minutes. Add the crabs, (if
blue crabs are not available, substitute other small to medium
crabs), cover, and return to boil.  Once steam starts to escape from
under the cover, let cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let
sit, covered, for 10 minutes more. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home
Cooking" Published by Randon House Alex says, "Serves 2 Cajuns, 4
elsewhere." He writes, "We like to lay out the crabs and vegetables
on a large table covered with lots of paper and have a feast."
