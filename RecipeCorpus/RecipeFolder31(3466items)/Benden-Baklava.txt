Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
12 oz Melted Clarified Butter Or
-Fat
4 oz Vegetable Oil
32 oz Pulverized Benden Nuts
-(Walnuts)
Powdered Bark Spice
-(Optional) (Cinnamon)
40    Leaves Of Flour-And-Water
-Dough Stretched To Paper
-Thinness
(Phylo Dough)
12 oz Granulated Sweetening
1/4 oz Strained Citrus Juice
6 oz Water
1/4 oz Sweet Syrup
Mix the butter and oil.  Cut the dough to the shape of the baking pan
by laying the pan on top of the stacked leaves.  Butter the inside of
the baking dish.  Gently place one leaf of dough into the pan,
carefully fitting it to the bottom of the pan.  The leaves are very
fragile, so fold to pick them up, and unfold when in place in the
pan. Brush with the butter and oil mixture.  Repeat with nine more
sheets. Sprinkle with 3 Tbls of the powdered nuts (with optional
spice to taste) on the tenth leaf. Open two more leaves of dough on
top of the nut mixture, buttering each in its turn. Repeat with the
nut mixture, then two more leave and so on until all is used.  As the
last two leaves are used, bursh the top with the butter and oil
mixture.

With a very sharp knife, score the top of the pastry lightly ,
lengthwise, into four and then draw the knife diagonally to make a
lozenge-shaped portion.  Bake in a preheated 325 Degree F oven for 90
minutes.

Combine the next three ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook until the
sweetening dissolves.  Boil for 5 minutes or unti la drop of it forms
a soft ball when dropped into cold water.  Remove from the heat and
stir in the syrup.  Cool.  As soon as the pastry is baked, remove
from the oven and pour the sweet mixture over it.  Cool the pastry to
room temperature before serving.
