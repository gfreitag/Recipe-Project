Title: Artichoke and Potato Frittata+
Categories: Vegetables, Cheese/eggs, Potatoes
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Artichoke hearts (you must
-thaw them if they are
-frozen) 6 to 8 of them
2 tb Olive oil
1 sm Potato, cooked and cubed
1 ts Rosemary leaves, fresh and
-minced
Freshly ground
-black pepper to taste
3    Eggs
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Mozerella cheese, shredded
1 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
Italian parsley, chopped
1. Bring a small saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, and add
the artichoke hearts. Lower the heat and simmer for 3 minutes; then
rinse, drain and pat dry. Set them aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch skillet (preferable
nonstick.) Add the potato and rosemary, and saute until golden and
crisp, about 3 minutes. Add the artichoke hearts and saute until
golden, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper and
set aside.

3. Preheat the broiler.

4. Lightly beat the eggs with the 1/4 ts. and black pepper to taste.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet. Pour in the
eggs and cook, over medium-low heat, stirring lightly, just until the
bottom is set, 3 to 4 minutes. The top should still be wet. Add the
artichokes and potatoes; sprinkle with the cheeses. Place the skillet
under the broiler and cook until the frittata is golden and sizzling,
about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.

From the book "The New Basics cookbook" by Julee Rosso amd Sheila
Lukens Wonderful book, I highly reccomend it.
