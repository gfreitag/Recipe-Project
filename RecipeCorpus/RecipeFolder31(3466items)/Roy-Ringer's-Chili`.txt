Title: Roy Ringer's Chili`
Categories: Vegetables, Chili
Yield: 12 servings
8 oz Pinto Beans
5 c  Tomatoes, Canned With Juice
1 lb Green Peppers -- chopped
1 1/2 tb Salad Oil
1 1/2 lb Onions -- chopped
2 1/2 lb Beef -- coarsely ground
1 lb Pork -- coarsely ground
2    Cloves Garlic -- crushed
1/2 c  Parsley -- chopped
4 tb Butter
1/3 c  Chili Powder
2 tb Salt
1 1/2 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
Ground
1 1/2 ts Cumin Powder
Wash the beans and soak overnight. Cover the beans with at least 1" of
water and simmer, covered, until tender. Then add the tomatoes and
their juice, and simmer, covered, another 5 mins. In a large frying
pan, saute the green peppers in salad oil for 5 mins. Add the onions
and cook until tender, stirring often. In another frying pan, saute
the ground beef and pork, garlic, and parsley in the butter until the
meat is brown, approximately 15 mins. Then add the meat to the onion
mixture and cook 10 mins. Finally, add the onion mixture and the meat
to the bean mixture, with chili powder, salt, pepper, and cumin.
Simmer the whole mixture, covered, for 1 hour. Remove the cover and
cook slowly another 30 mins. Skim the fat from the top and serve.
Like most chili, this improves each day. Serve with guacamole and
sugar-and-spice gingersnaps.
