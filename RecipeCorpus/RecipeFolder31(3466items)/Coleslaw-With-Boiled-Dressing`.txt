Title: Coleslaw With Boiled Dressing`
Categories: Tasteofhome, Salads
Yield: 12 servings
1    Head White Or Red Cabbage
(2-3 Lbs) -- shredded
1 ts Salt
1 md Onion -- finely chopped
1 md Red Or Green Pepper,
Finely Chopped -- optional
3/4 c  White Vinegar
1/3 c  Vegetable Oil
3/4 c  Sugar
Shred the cabbage with a slaw-cutter or the slicing blade of a food
processor. Salt the cabbage and put in a bowl. DO NOT STIR! Place the
chopped onion and pepper over the top of the cabbage. Again, DO NOT
STIR! Bring the vinegar, oil, and sugar to a boil (the original
recipe called for 1 1/2 cups of sugar, but this is far too sweet for
most tastes). Set aside to cool. Then pour over the cabbage. Let
stand WITHOUT STIRRING for 1 1/2 hrs. Then mix thoroughly. Cover and
store in the refrigerator. It will keep for weeks or even up to 3
months.

NOTES:  Not stirring prevents a juice or brine from forming and thus
diluting the dressing. Recipe By
