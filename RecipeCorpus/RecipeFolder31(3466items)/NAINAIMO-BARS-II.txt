NOTES:

*  No-bake, 3-layer (chocolate covered) bars -- Nanaimo bars are a
traditional Canadian dessert, though nobody is certain where the
tradition came from. Laura Secord is a Canadian candy company; their
cook book says this about the origin of these fattening delicacies:

"A version of these no-bake bars developed in the Canadian kitchens
of a well-known food company, was christened by them Nanaimo bars
after the city of that name on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo (from
sne-ny-mo, a local Indian term for a loose confederation of five
bands) started as a Hudson Bay Trading Post in 1849."

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
