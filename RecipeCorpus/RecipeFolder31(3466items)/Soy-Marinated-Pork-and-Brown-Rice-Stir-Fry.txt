Prepare the brown rice one day ahead and have it ready for this quick
stir-fry.

Steam or boil the snow peas until crispy-tender, about 2 minutes.  Set
aside.

Heat the skillet (or wok) until hot enough to evaporate 1 drop of
water upon contact.  Add the oil and heat enough to sizzle one piece
of vegetable.  Add the sweet red bell pepper, mushrooms and carrots.
Stir-fry over high heat until browned, about 2 minutes.  Reduce the
heat. Add the garlic, ginger root and salt.

Add the green onions, rice, snow peas and the pork.  Stir until heated
through.  Taste and add soy sauce, sesame oil and salt to taste.
Garnish with the basil leaf strips.
