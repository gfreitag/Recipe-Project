Basic Biscuits Sift dry ingredients; rub in the shortening as lightly
as possible with fingers until just blended. Have milk as cold as
possible, mix with flour to form a soft dough. Mix with a flexible
knife rather than a spoon, as the steel blade is colder than a spoon
and also because the knife cuts and mixes more thoroughly. Turn out
onto a well floured board; pat to 3/4" thick. Cut into rounds; put on
a baking pan, being sure they do not touch. Bake at 425 degrees 12-14
minutes.

Sweet Rolls Make biscuits into a loaf; let raise. Roll out 1/4" thick;
spread with a thick layer of butter, cover with sugar. Roll up and
slice 1" thick. Let raise, bake at 350 degrees 20-25 minutes.

Cheese Biscuits Make Basic biscuits, adding cheese to the dough. Bake
the same way.

Parker House Rolls Make biscuits except use 2/3 cup milk; add sugar.
roll out 1/3" thick, cut into rounds, brush with butter, crease
across centers; fold in half. Bake as directed.

the chief requirements for "good biscuits" are: 1 A very soft dough,
so soft as to be almost sticky. 2. Very little handling because
manipulation destroys their lightness. 3. A very quick oven. If
"biscuits" are not allowed to touch each other in the pan, they will
be lighter and more delicate than when placed close together.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
