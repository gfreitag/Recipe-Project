Crisco shortening for frying
Rinse chicken pieces under cold running water and pat dry with paper
towels. Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a paper or heavy
plastic bag. Add a few pieces of chicken at a time and shake to coat.
Place Crisco in a heavy deep-sided skillet and heat to 360 degrees
(medium high on an electric stove). Fry the chicken, uncovered, for a
total of 30 minutes for white meat and 40 minutes for dark meat,
turning with tongs 4 to 5 times during frying for even browning.
Remove from the pan, drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.

Spicy Variation:

Combine milk and egg in shallow bowl. Set aside. Combine flour, salt,
paprika, pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasoning in paper or heavy
plastic bag. Shake a few pieces of chicken at a time in bag of
seasoned flour. Roll pieces in egg mixture. Shake again in flour.
Allow to sit 10 minutes so flour adheres to chicken. Melt Crisco to
depth of 1/2 to 1" in heavy deep-sided skillet. Heat to 365 degrees.
Add chicken. Brown on all sides. Reduce heat to 275 degrees. Cook
until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes for white meat and 40
minutes for dark meat. Turn several times during cooking. Drain on
paper towels. Serve immediately.
