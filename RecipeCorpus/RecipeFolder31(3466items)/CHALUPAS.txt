Title: CHALUPAS
Categories: Main dish, Tex/mexican, Usenet
Yield: 12 chalupas
Vegetable oil
12    Corn tortillas (the
-thinner the better)
6 c  Frijoles refritos
-(or less)
1/2 lb Cheddar cheese
-(sharp), grated
1 lg Tomato, chopped
3 c  Lettuce, shredded
In a small skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil.  Test the
oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.
When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to
bubble frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil
and the tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to
cook the chalupa shells. This is important because there is nothing
worse than a soggy chalupa shell which results from the oil not being
hot enough.

Fry tortillas completely flat on both sides until very crisp.  Drain
and keep warm on a newspaper-covered cookie sheet in a warm oven.

Spread about 1/4-inch thick layer of refried beans on each fried
tortilla. Top with a generous amount of grated sharp Cheddar cheese
and about 1 T chopped onion.

Place assembled chalupas on a cookie sheet and brown under broiler
until cheese melts.  Watch them carefully under the broiler, they can
burn quite quickly.  Top with shredded lettuce and tomato and serve.
