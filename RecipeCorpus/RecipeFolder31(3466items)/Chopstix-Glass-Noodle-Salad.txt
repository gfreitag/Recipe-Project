Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
8 oz Bean threads or rice sticks
1 c  Shredded red cabbage
1/2 lb Snow peas
1    Sweet red pepper
3 oz Enoki mushrooms
3 oz Daikon sprouts
-OR- other sprouts
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
2 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
2    Garlic cloves
1 tb Grated or minced orange peel
1/4 c  Minced cilantro
1/4 c  Minced green onions
9 tb Red wine vinegar
1/4 c  Oriental sesame oil
2 tb Safflower oil
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Chinese chili sauce
1 ts Salt
Soak bean threads or rice sticks in hot water until soft, about 30
minutes. Drain thoroughly and cut into 4-inch lengths.

Snap off stems of snowpeas and discard.  Blanch snowpeas for 5
seconds in in 2 quarts boiling water.  Immediately transfer snowpeas
to a bowl of ice water.  When cold, drain and pat dry, then cut into
fine slivers. Stem and seed pepper, then slice into 2-inch slivers.
Remove and discard dirty ends of mushrooms and separate strands.

In a food processor or blender, mince the garlic and ginger.  Add
orange peel, cilantro and green onions.  Process until finely minced,
then add remaining dressing ingredients and blend to combine.

To assemble, combine the bean threads (or rice sticks) with the other
salad ingredients.  Pour the dressing over and toss to combine
thoroughly. May be prepared up to 2 hours in advance.
