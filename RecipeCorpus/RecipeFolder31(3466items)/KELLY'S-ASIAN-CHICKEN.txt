Title: KELLY'S ASIAN CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
3 1/2 lb Frying chicken cut
-into serving pieces,
-or equivalent in
-chicken parts of
-your choice
3 tb Peanut oil
3/4 c  Distilled white vinegar
1/4 c  Soy sauce
3 tb Honey
1    Garlic bulb, peeled
-and coarsely chopped
-(yes that says BULB,
-the whole head)
2 sm Red peppers, dried
-(hot -- optional)
Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet and brown chicken on all sides
(5-10 minutes).  Use medium-high heat.

Add garlic and peppers about 1 minute before the end of the browning
process. Add the remaining ingredients and cook over medium heat until
chicken is done and sauce has reduced somewhat. This takes about 10
minutes.

If you are cooking white and dark meat together, remove the white meat
first or it will dry out. Watch that sauce does not burn or boil away.

Serve with rice, Chinese noodles or pasta.

NOTES:

*  Chicken with garlic and hot peppers -- Another winner from "The
Garlic Lover's Cookbook."  Don't let the amount of garlic scare you.

*  When you look in the skillet to see how everything is going and to
get a whiff of the lovely aroma, do not take a big whiff.  The
vinegar will knock you out!

*  This recipe won first place at a recent Garlic Cook-off at the
Gilroy Garlic Festival.
