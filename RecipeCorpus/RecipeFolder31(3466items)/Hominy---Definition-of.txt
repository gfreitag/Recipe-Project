HOMINY:

"  One of the first food gifts the American Indians gave to the
colonists, hominy is dried white or yellow corn kernels from which
the hull and germ have been removed. This process is done either
mechanically or chemically by soaking the corn in slaked lime or lye.
Hominy is sold canned, ready-to-eat or dried (which must be
reconstituted before using). It's commonly served as a side dish or
as part of a casserole. When dried hominy is broken or very coarsely
ground it is called 'Samp'. When ground, it is called 'hominy grits'
or simply 'grits' - and usually comes in three grinds - fine, medium,
and coarse. Hominy grits are generally simmered with water or milk
until very thick. The mixture can be served in a mushlike form or
chilled, cut into squares and fried. In the South, grits are served
as a side dish for breakfast or dinner."
