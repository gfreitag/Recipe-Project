Title: PAVLOVA II
Categories: Desserts, Down under, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
4 lg Egg whites
1 c  Sugar, castor
1 ts Cornflour
1 ts Vinegar
1 ts Vanilla flavour
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.  With an electric mixer beat the egg
whites until soft peaks form,  then gradually add the sugar.  Beat
until firm.

Add the cornflour, vinegar and vanilla.  When combined, turn out onto
a flat tray that has been greased and dusted with cornflour. Try a
circular shape with slightly more mixture at the edges so that it may
be served by placing goodies in its centre depression.

Cook in a pre-heated, cool (250 degrees F.) oven for one hour.  When
cooked, turn the oven off, leave the oven door slightly ajar, and
allow to cool slowly in the oven. This slow cooling works to prevent
the loss of too much height. Serve cold, with whipped cream and fresh
fruit pieces, strawberries and kiwi fruit for example.

NOTES:

*  Australian meringue dessert.

*  Cornflour is known in North America as cornstarch.  Castor sugar is
known there as granulated sugar.

*  Make sure that you start off with a clean bowl and beat the egg
whites well.  A bowl with smooth sides (glass, metal) will help the
eggs to whip up. A plastic bowl with scratches prevents the eggs from
attaining a very light texture. Also ensure that the sugar is fully
dissolved before going on to the next step. I have never had troubles
from over-whipping. The final texture should be meringue on the
inside with a thin crust on the outside.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients.
