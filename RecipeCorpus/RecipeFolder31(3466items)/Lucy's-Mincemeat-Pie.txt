For the mincemeat: Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring
to a boil, then lower heat, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring
frequently. Use 1/4 of the mixture for your pie and process the rest
for 20 mins to keep for later use.

For the crust: Preheat oven to 350 F. Put shortening in a bowl, pour
hot water over it, and stir, adding milk until the mixture is thick
and creamy. Sift the flour and salt together and beat into the
shortening mixture until a dough is formed. Pat into 2 balls. On a
floured board with a floured rolling pin, roll out 1 of them and
place in the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan. Put in mincemeat filling,
and cover with rolled-out 2nd ball of dough. Flute the edges and cut
slits in the top. Bake for 50 mins or until crust is golden.

Yield: 1 9-inch pie, plus extra mincemeat for canning.
