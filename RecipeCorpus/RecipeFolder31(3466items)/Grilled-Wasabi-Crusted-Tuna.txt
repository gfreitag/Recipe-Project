Title: Grilled Wasabi-Crusted Tuna
Categories: Fish, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Tuna steaks
2 tb Wasabi powder
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
Have fish seller cut tuna steaks in 3/4" thickness.  If desired,
swordfish or shark may be substituted for tuna. Mix wasabi powder and
lemon juice together to a thin paste consistency, adding more or less
of each ingredient until desired thickness is reached. Let stand ten
minutes for flavors to develop. Marinate tuna briefly in wasabi mix,
10 to 15 minutes, turning to coat. Wasabi should remain on steaks.
Grill steaks 3 to 4 minutes per side, allowing the grill-grate to
sear each side. Tuna is done when it barely loses its translucency in
the center. Serve immediately, with a seasoned rice pilaf and a
tossed salad.

Wasabi powder is found in small cans in most Oriental grocery markets,
although it can now be found in many of the larger supermarkets with a
gourmet foods section.  Wasabi is referred to as "Japanese
horseradish", although this is something of a misnomer since strictly
speaking the root from which the powder is ground is not a
horseradish. The powder is spicy hot, but not a long-burning heat.
Most of the heat will be lost in the marinating/grilling process,
leaving a wonderful crusted essence to flavor the tuna.
