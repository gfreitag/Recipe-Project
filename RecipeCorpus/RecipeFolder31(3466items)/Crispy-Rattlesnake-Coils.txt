Title: Crispy Rattlesnake Coils
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 10 servings
1    Rattlesnake; cut in strips
Flour
Salt & Pepper
Crisco
PREPARATION Cut rattlesnake into 8" strips about 1/4" thick. Salt and
pepper lightly. Put flour into a container that can be covered. Add
strips. Shake. Refrigerate for about two hours. This will allow the
flour to become sticky and while the Crisco is heating in a deep
fryer, pull the pieces apart and re-flour the pieces again.  Add
flour if necessary. When the Crisco shortening is hot, add only
enough snake strips so that all pieces are covered by the hot grease.
Fry until golden brown. Dump into a container that has been prewarmed
in the oven. Continue frying the rest of the rattlesnake strips.

NOTE:  The fried rattlesnake strips will appear to be coiled!

SERVING Use a basket lined with a cloth napkin. Add the fried, coiled
snake pieces. Cover with the napkin.
