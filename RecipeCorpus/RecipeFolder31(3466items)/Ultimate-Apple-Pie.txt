Using 2 knives, cut the butter and shortening with the flour and
salt. When crumbly add the water. Using the heel of the hand, press
small amounts of the dough away until well combined, working quickly.
Form into a ball, wrap in wax paper, and refrigerate.

Combine the apples, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice and rind,
flour and water. Adjust the seasonings.

Roll out a little less than half the dough between two pieces of wax
paper. Turn the dough into a pie tin, and fill with the apple
sections, which should come well above the rim. Dot with butter.

Roll out the remaining dough. Using your fingers, moisten the rim of
the bottom crust with cold water and cover with the top crust,
crimping top to bottom. With a fork, prick holes in the top.

Bake 15 mins in a 450 F oven, then bake 30 mins more at 350 F. Serve
immediately or the next day, but not the day after!

NOTES : The author thinks that apple pie does not improve with age.
She also, thinks that pie should be served warm with vanilla ice
cream or a wedge of cheddar. She says that any New England apple-pie
lover knows that "Apple pie without cheddar is like a kiss without
the squeeze." This pie is based on an 1887 recipe from Miss Parloa's
Kitchen Companion.
