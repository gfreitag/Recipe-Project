Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 30 servings
2 c  Bacon drippings (for roux)
7 c  Onion, chopped
3 c  Green onions, chopped
3 c  Parsley, chopped
1 x  Bacon drippins/brown chicken
1 x  Water
16 c  Tomato sauce
1 1/2 pt Stuffed olives
8 tb Louisiana hot sauce
6 tb Salt
6 c  Plain flour
1 c  Bell pepper, chopped
1 c  Celery, chopped
1/4 c  Garlic, chopped
20 lb Baking hens, (see directions
1 lb Mushrooms, sliced
8 c  Chablis wine
6 tb Lea & Perrins
1 ts Dried mint, crushed
The bacon drippings are for browning the chicken. The 20 lbs of
chicken should be cut up in 2-inch-long pieces. Justin likes more
wine in this sauce than some peoples.  If you don't wish to use all 8
Cups of Chablis in the sauce, feel free to drink what the sauce don't
take. Make sure you taste your sauce as you add the wine. Me, I likes
it. My wife, she don't. Make a roux.  (see the recipe for Justin
Wilson's roux, also posted here). Add onions, bell pepper, green
onions, and celery and saute until onions are tender and clear.  Add
parsley and garlic and saute. Brown off chicken while roux is being
made. After onions, etc. are tender, add water to bring roux to a
smooth paste. Add all other ingredients and enough water to cover
well.  Bring to a boil, and then cut heat. Cook for about 4 to 6
hours. Serve over spaghetti. This is for a party and will serve 20 to
40 people. You can freeze what you don't eat. From Justin Wilson's
