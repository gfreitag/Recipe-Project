Title: Red Sauce - {salsa Colorada}
Categories: Spanish, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
3 sm Tomatoes, red ripe
1    Head Garlic
2    Hard-boiled egg yolks
12    Almonds -- peeled and
Toasted
3/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Wine vinegar
1/2    Hot chili pepper
(or cayenne pepper to
Taste)
Salt -- to taste
Bake unpeeled tomatoes and garlic in oven until tomatoes are very
soft. Remove peel from tomatoes and garlic, mash in mortar or
electric blender with pepper.  Add yolks of hard-boiled eggs with
almonds; when well blended, gradually mix in oil and vinegar.  Season
with salt if necessary. This recipe makes 1 1/2 cups of sauce.
Comments:  Because the garlic is precooked, this sauce does not have
a particularly strong flavor, even though it calls for a head of
garlic.  It is particularly good with boiled vegetables, cold meats,
and cold or hot fish.    Recipe Source: THE SPANISH COOKBOOK   by
