Title: Basic Risotto
Categories: Rice
Yield: 4 -6 serving
1 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Finely chopped onion
2 md Cloves garlic, peeled and
Minced
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
4 c  Chicken broth combined with
1 cup water, heated
1/3 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
1. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the butter and oil over medium
heat.
Add the onion and garlic; saute until softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir
in the rice and cook, stirring 2 minutes.

2. Slowly start to add the liquid, about a ladleful at a time.  Cook,
covered, over low heat, 10 minutes.  Wait until the liquid has been
absorbed each time before adding the next ladleful.  Repeat the
cooking
process, covered, 10 minutes.  Uncover and continue cooking,

salt
and freshly ground black pepper.
