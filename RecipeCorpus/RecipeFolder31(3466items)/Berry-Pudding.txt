2 c  Fresh or frozen strawberries
Or raspberries
3/4 c  Frozen concentrated fruit
Juice, (i.e. apple or white
Grape, rasperry)
Put it all in a blender or food processer till smooth.  If you want
fruit chunks, save some berries out, chop coarsely, and stir in.

the kids.  It also makes a nice "sauce" for angel cake and fresh
berries.
