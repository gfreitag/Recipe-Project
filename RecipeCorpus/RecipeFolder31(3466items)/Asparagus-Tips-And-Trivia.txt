MMMMM-----------------ASPARAGUS TIPS AND TRIVIA----------------------
Wild asparagus was first gathered by the Greeks, who discovered it
growing on the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean.  By the year 200
BC, the Romans were cultivating it. It came to America with the first
settlers in the New World.

It is considered by many to be an aphrodisiac and is mentioned in love
poetry by early Greeks and in Chinese and East Indian literature. The
lusty Madame Pompadour served it often, drizzled in a lemon butter
sauce, and sexologist Van de Velde included asparagus as one of the
best all around love foods.

It is a member of the lily family and includes 150 different species.
Two of the most common are what I like to refer to as "fat ones" and
"skinny ones". Both are reputed to have the same flavor, although the
skinny ones seem to be most popular. Whte asparagus is nothing more
than stalks that have not been exposed to sunlight.

Asparagus is rich in potassium, phosphorus and calcium -- and six
medium spears contain a mere 20 calories. Drowning them in melted
butter, however, adds more calories.

It takes two years from planting time to first harvest to enjoy this
perennial vegetable. It requires a dormant period, and so grows well
in four season regions. Prime harvest time is generally between March
and June. An asparagus bed can be productive for 15 years or longer
with proper care.

Steaming in the microwave or on top of the stove, using a metal
steamer basket, is the recommended cooking method and only takes a
few minutes.

Stalks can be trimmed by snapping off the bottoms at the bending
point, or by peeling about 2 inches up with a vegetable peeler. Look
for firm spears with tightly closed heads.
