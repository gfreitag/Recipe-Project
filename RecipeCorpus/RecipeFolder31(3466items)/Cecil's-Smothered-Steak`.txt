1. In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat, turning once,

drain, leaving the fat in the skillet. Crumble the bacon and set
aside.

2. In the same skillet, in 2 batches, cook the steaks over medium-high
heat, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 6 mins.
Transfer to a plate and set aside.

3. Pour out all but 2 Tbs of the fat from the skillet. Add the onion
and bell and chile peppers. Reduce the heat to medium and cook,
stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 mins. Stir in the
tomato sauce and water and bring to a simmer, scraping up the browned
bits on the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Return the
steaks to the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer,
turning the meat occasionally, until very tender, about 1 1/2 hrs.
During the last 10 mins of cooking, add the bacon.

4. Skim any fat from the surface of the sauce. Season the sauce with
salt and pepper, and serve immediately over mashed potatoes or
noodles.
