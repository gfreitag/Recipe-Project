Chop the garlic very finely.  Chop the onion.  Combine in a suitable
pot the tomato products and seasonings. Bring to a simmer.

In a bowl, combine the meatball ingredients except the sherry.  Break
this mixture apart into small balls or bits according to preference.

Heat a wok or skillet and saute the meat mixture until cooked to
'rare'. Do not overcook or singe the meat.  Remove the grease from
the meat mixture by straining in a colander, then return to the hot
wok or skillet and reheat. Add sherry and reduce.  Add this to the
sauce in the pot.  Simmer this mixture on the lowest possible heat
for 6 or 7 hours. Stir occasionally.

NOTES:

*  An exotically spiced spaghetti sauce with meat -- This is a very
adaptable sauce which can be used in any recipe requiring tomato
sauces. Best on spaghetti with garlic bread!

*  I have found that Hunt's tomato products deliver the best flavor
for this sauce; they are somewhat sweeter and less acidic than other
brands. I always use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce.

*  This spaghetti sauce is the work of about 2 years experimentation.
It has won some of the local cooking contests here in Maine.

: Difficulty:  easy but tedious.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 7 hours cooking.
