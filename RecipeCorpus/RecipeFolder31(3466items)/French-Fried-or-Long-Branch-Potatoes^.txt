Peel good sized potatoes and cut in strips about 1/4" or 1/2" wide.
Soak in cold salted water for about an hour. Drain and dry
thoroughly. Fry as for potato chips. When making a large amount of
these for a crowd, fry them only until they are soft and tender, but
not brown. Drain and keep warm until dinnertime. then fry them again
in lard at about 395 degrees. Drain, sprinkle with salt and serve
right away, with ketchup if you like.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
