Title: Pot Roast
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/2    To 3 lbs bottom round, eye
-of round, or brisket
2 md Onions, sliced
4    Carrots, peeled and sliced
6    Cloves garlic, crushed
2 ts Salt, or to taste
2    Bay leaves
1 c  Ketchup
3 c  Water, or enough to cover
-the meat
Halfway
4    Potatoes, quartered
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

In a Dutch oven or heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid, place the meat,
onions, carrots, garlic, salt, bay leaves, ketchup, and enough water
to cover the meat halfway.

Cover tightly and cook in the preheated oven for 2 hours.  After 2
hours, add the potatoes and as much water as needed to again cover
the meat halfway.  Cover and continue cooking for 40 to 50 minutes
more, or until the meat is tender and the potatoes are cooked through.

Let cool at room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day remove all of the congealed fat and the bay leaves.
Slice the meat, reheat, and serve.  I always slice the meat cold
because it is much easier to get nice slices, then I replace the meat
in the gravy, cover the pot, and reheat on top of the stove over low
heat for 30 minutes, unto the potatoes are heated through.  Makes 6
servings.

ADVICE FROM MAMA:  Make this the day before you want to serve it.
This is a great "freezer to oven" dish, or one that is made several
days ahead of when you needed it.  The longer it hangs around, the
better it tastes.

I Love eating this pot roast with kasha varnishkes (see R-KASHA
VARNISHKES). In fact I can make a meal of just kasha varnishkes and
pot roast gravy.  Save the pot roast for sandwiches.
