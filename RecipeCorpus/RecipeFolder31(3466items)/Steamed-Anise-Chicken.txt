Title: Steamed Anise Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
2    Limes
1 tb Brown sugar
4    Star anise, divided (see
Note)
1/8 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
1/3 c  Water
4    Boneless and skinless
Chicken breast halves
1. Squeeze the juice out of the limes.  Reserve the peels.  Measure 3
tablespoons juice.

2. In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, brown sugar, 2 star
anise,
crushed red pepper, soy sauce and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce
the
heat and simmer 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.

3. Put the chicken in a glass dish and spoon half of the soy mixture
over,
turning to coat.  Marinate at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and
refrigerate for longer marination, up to 24 hours.

4. When ready to steam the chicken, put the lime peels, 2 star anise
and
about 8 cups of water into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Fit a
steamer basket or rack over the top.  Remove the chicken from the
marinade, discarding the leftover marinade, and place in the
steamer.
Cover tightly and steam about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is
no
longer pink in the center.

5. In a small saucepan cook down the remaining soy mixture until
reduced
to about 2 tablespoons.  (You can add a little water if you reduce
the
mixture too much.)  Spoon over the steamed chicken.

Note: Star anise is a dried spice with a pungent, licorice flavour.
It can be purchased at most Asian groceries.  You can substitute 1/2
teaspoon lightly crushed anise seed for 2 star anise, although the
flavour will not be as distinctive.
