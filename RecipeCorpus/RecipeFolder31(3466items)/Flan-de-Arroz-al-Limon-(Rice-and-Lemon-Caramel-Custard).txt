Title: Flan de Arroz al Limon (Rice and Lemon Caramel Custard)
Categories: Spanish, West europe, Desserts, Rice
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Milk
2 c  Single cream
4 tb Rice
Finely pared rind of 1 lemon
1/4 oz Castor sugar
6    Egg yolks
Put the milk, cream, rice and lemon rind in a saucepan. Bring to the
boil over low heat. Simmer gently for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, put 3/4 of the sugar in a saucepan over moderate heat.
Shake the pan occasionally until the sugar begins to melt. Stirring,
cook the syrup until it is a rich brown, being careful not to let it
burn. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the caramel into a 2
1/2-pint heatproof bowl. Turn the bowl around quickly so that the
caramel coats the sides evenly. Set aside. Preheat the oven to
150C/300F/gas mark 5. In another bowl, beat the remaining sugar with
the egg yolks. Remove the pan from the heat. Remove and discard the
lemon rind. Stirring constantly, gradually add the beaten egg yolks
to the milk and rice. Pour the mixture into the caramel-lined bowl.
Put the bowl in a baking tin filled with boiling water and bake for
30 minutes. Cool then chill the pudding in the refrigerator. When
thoroughly chilled, turn out on to a serving dish.

"The Spanish prefer to end a meal with fruit and, consequently, there
are not many recipes for desserts. In southern Spain the most common
dessert is "flan", a caramel custard. This recipe is a pleasant
variation."
