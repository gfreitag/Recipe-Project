MY WAY:  Start a loaf of French Bread in the bread machine so it is
finished about 15 min. before you want to eat.  Slice onion or chop
(not too fine) in a food copper.  Use water instead of wine and leave
out the flour.  Add 1 tsp extra liquid bouillon (eg. Oxo). If you
don't have fresh bread to serve on the side, dry croutons (bread
cubes) are good on top of the soup.  Sprinkle with parmesan. WARNING:
Guests may fill up on the bread/soup and not have room for dinner!
