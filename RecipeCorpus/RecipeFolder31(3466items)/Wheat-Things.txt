Title: Wheat Things
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Uncooked oatmeal
2 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Wheat germ
3 tb Sugar
3/4 c  Oil
1 c  Water
Mix ingredients and roll onto two cookie sheets. Sprinkle with salt,
roll again to press salt in. Cut into squares & bake at 350, about 20
minutes. Check often and remove crackers as they turn brown and hard.

When those things hit 3 bucks a box, I found these to be as good, at
1/4 the cost.
