Title: TAJINE
Categories: Soup/stew, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
Olive oil
Butter
1 lb Chopped lamb (no bones)
1    Onion
Ginger, fresh; 1" cube,
-minced
1    Cinnamon stick; 2"
1 pn Saffron (just for the
-colour)
1/2 lb Dried fruits (pick any
-combination you like,
-tutti-frutti always works
-fine combined with
-French dried prunes)
1 oz Sesame seed
Salt; to taste
Pepper, black; to taste
Fry meat, onion and seasoning until the meat turns brown (you can
either squeeze the ginger in a garlic-squeezer or something, or you
can smash it and add the whole thing).

Put meat and onion in a North-african cooking-pot (forgot its name,
but an ordinary stewpot will do just as fine).

Add water to a level that just covers the meat, put the lid on the
pot, and stew for about 1 hour.

Add dried fruits, and stew for another 30 minutes.

Roast sesame seed in a grill or dry frying pan till it's brown.

Remove the cinnamon and cover the dish with the roasted sesame seed.
