Categories: Game, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
4    Pigeons
1 1/2 pt Water or stock
1    Stalk celery, chopped
1 sl Salt pork
2 tb Butter

Clean and truss the birds as for roasting. Chop up the pork, fry out
the fat and brown the bids. Put pigeons in a casserole, add celery,
seasoning and stock. Cover closely and cook about 2 hours. Put birds
on serving dish, thicken gravy with flour and butter rubbed together.
Remove celery, and pour gravy over birds. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
