Yield: 1 loaf
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, cream butter and
sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well
after each addition.

Combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside.
Combine applesauce and molasses.

Add dry ingredients alternately with applesauce mixture  to egg
mixture. Fold in raisins and nuts. Pour into a greased 9 1/4 x 5 1/4
x 2 3/4 inch loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour, or until a
toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes,
remove from pan and continue cooling on a wire rack.

NOTES:

*  A simple, fragrant, apple-nut raisin bread -- I found this recipe
on the back of a label for a baking loaf pan.  It is easy to make and
because of the molasses it is very fragrant while baking. Yield: 1
large loaf.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, 30 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
