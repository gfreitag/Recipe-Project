To make the green herb dressing: combine all the ingredients in a
blender and blend to mix. Taste for seasoning, pour into a bowl and
chill until needed.

Preheat oven to 450F. In a shallow plate, combine the cumin, cardamon,
ginger, white peppercorns, coriander, salt and pepper; stir to mix
well. Press one side of the salmon into the spice mixture firmly so
the spices will stick.

Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof non-stick skillet. Add the
salmon, spice side down, and cook over medium-high heat until the
spices are aromatic and the crust is lightly colored. Transfer the
skillet to the oven and bake for 3 minutes. Turn the salmon and
continue baking until just opaque through, about 2 minutes longer.

Arrange salmon on individual plates, spoon the herb dressing over and
serve.
