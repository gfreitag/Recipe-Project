Categories: Appetizers, Polish, Pie/tart
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 c  Cool water
3 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Salt
8 oz Cream cheese
3 tb Melted butter
5 c  Flour
1 ts Sugar
Beat eggs until fluffy. Add cream cheese and mix until smooth. Add
sugar, salt and cooled butter. Add flour, milk and water. Knead until
smooth and elastic (3 to 5 min.). 1. Working with 1/3 of the dough at
a time: Roll the dough thinly (about 1/8"), and cut into 3-1/2" to
4-1/2" circles. You can use a biscuit cutter or a can that has been
washed, and both ends removed. 2. Using sticky side of dough, put
small amount of filling in half and press firmly together at edges,
being VERY careful not to let any of the filling touch the crimped
edge 3. Bring a 6-qt. pot of water to a full rolling boil. Carefully
add 10 to 12 pierogi, stirring gently with a wooden spoon. Do this
slowly, making sure the water continues boiling. 4. After perogi come
to top of the water, continue cooking for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
they become firm and slightly puffy. 5. Remove pierogi with slotted
spoon, and plunge into a large pot of cold water. Pour into a
colander and rinse with cold water.

Serving methods: Layer them in a large casserole with sauteed onions
and grated cheese....or they can be sauteed in butter until they are
a light golden brown. They can also be heated in a skillet in which 2
tablespoons of bread-crumbs and 1/2 cup of butter have been browned
together.
