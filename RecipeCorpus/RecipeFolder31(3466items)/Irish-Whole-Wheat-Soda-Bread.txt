Title: Irish Whole Wheat Soda Bread
Categories: Breads, Irish
Yield: 8 servings
3 c  Flour, whole wheat
1 c  Flour, all purpose
1 tb Salt
1 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk, yogurt, or milk
-soured with lemon juice
Combine the dry ingredients and mix thouroughly to distribute the
soda and baking powder, then add enough buttermilk to make a soft
dough but firm enough to hold its shape. Knead on a lightly floured
board for 2 or 3 minutes, until quite smooth and velvety. Form into a
round loaf and place in a well buttered 8 inch cake pan or on a well
buttered cookie sheet. Cut a cross on the top of the loaf with a very
sharp floured knife. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 35-40 minutes,
or until the loaf is nicely browned and sounds hollow when rapped
with the knuckles. (The cross will have spread open which is
characteristic of soda bread.) From _Beard on Bread_.
