Title: Champignons Sautes Au Beurre (Sauteed Mushrooms)
Categories: Holiday, Vegetables, French, Side dish
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Butter
1 tb Oil
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms, washed
-well dried, left whole if
-small, sliced or quartered
-if large
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
1 tb Minced shallots or green
-onions (1-2T)
Salt and pepper
Place a 10 inch enameled skillet over high heat with the butter and
oil. As soon as you see that the butter foam has begun to subside,
indicating it is hot enough, add the mushrooms.  Toss and shake the
pan 4-5 mins. During their saute the mushrooms will at first absorb
the fat.  In 2-3 mins the fat will reappear on their surface, and the
mushrooms will begin to brown. As soon as they have browned lightly,
remove from heat.

If using, toss shallots or green onions with the mushrooms.  Saute
over moderate heat 2 minutes.
