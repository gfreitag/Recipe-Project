Title: OATMEAL FUDGE COOKIES
Categories: Cake/cookie, Usenet
Yield: 3 dozen
3 c  Rolled oats
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Nuts, chopped (optional)
2 c  Sugar, granulated
1/2 c  Cocoa powder
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/4 lb Butter
Combine oats, vanilla and nuts in a bowl and set aside.

Combine sugar, cocoa and evaporated milk in a heavy, 2-quart sauce
pan. Bring to a full rolling boil over medium-high heat, STIRRING
CONSTANTLY. Let boil, while stirring, for 2 minutes.

Remove pan from heat and add the butter.  Stir until butter is melted
and incorporated.  Quickly add oat mixture to pan and stir until well
mixed.

Drop by the spoonful onto waxed paper.  Let cool for 2 hours to set.

NOTES:

*  No-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies -- This may be my all-time
favorite cookie recipe.  I don't remember where I got this particular
version of the recipe but I remember my great-aunt making these
cookies for us as kids.

*  My great-aunt never put nuts in these cookies.  I like nuts but I
find that they get lost in the recipe. If you want the oats to be less
prominent, use quick-cooking oats. They will fall apart somewhat in
the final mixing.

*  A heavy sauce pan makes burning the fudge less likely but stir,
stir, stir, anyway.

*  The cooking time at boil is important.  Cooked too little the
cookies will not set; too much and they start to harden before you
get them out of the pan.

*  These cookies are better the next day, if there are any left.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation and cooking, 2 hours cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients, watch the cooking time.
