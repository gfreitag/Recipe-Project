Title: INDONESIAN BRAISED PORK
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
4 lb Pork, cut into small,
-bite-size pieces
1    Onion, chopped
2 tb Red peppers, crushed
4    Garlic cloves, minced
1 tb Lime juice
2/3 c  Soy sauce
3 tb Brown sugar
Fry pork, onion, red peppers and garlic over high heat in a heavy
frying pan, stirring frequently for about 20 minutes or until
well-browned. Add lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar. Reduce heat
and simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes.

Put in a covered dish and keep warm in the oven while you make the
rice to serve it over.  This makes it easy to make the rice, and the
pork actually browns a little more during this time.

NOTES:

*  Pork with lime and hot peppers -- This recipe was originally based
on one I found in a paperback cookbook. Over the years I have adapted
it into what you see here. It is fairly hot, but always gets rave
reviews from everyone, even from people who normally don't like hot
food. Yield: Serves 6-8.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
