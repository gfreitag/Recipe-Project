Title: PEACH BLUEBERRY COBBLER
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
1    Pastry recipe
8    Peaches; peeled & sliced
2 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Lemon rind, grated
1/2 ts Almond extract
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Flour
2 ts Butter
1 pt Blueberries, fresh
In a bowl, turn sliced peaches in mixture of lemon juice, grated rind
and almond extract. In another bowl, blend together the sugar, flour
and butter until you have a texture of coarse crumbs. (These steps
may be completed several hours in advance of baking and prepared
ingredients refrigerated separately, covered.)  In a 9 x 13 baking
pan, sprinkle half the sugar mixture.  Add peach mixture in an even
layer.  Spread blueberries over the top so some of the peaches are
showing. Sprinkle with remaining sugar mixture.  Roll out pastry
large enough to cover the cobbler completely and drape over; slash
the crust to let the steam escape. Bake in oven preheated to 375
degrees for 40 - 50 minutes. Serve warm.
