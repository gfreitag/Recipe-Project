Categories: Bbq/grill, Vegetables
Yield: 1 recipe
2 md Aubergines
-- sliced into l/2" rounds
5 tb Olive oil
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Chopped fresh chives
Lightly salt the aubergine slices and leave to stand for 30 minutes
to draw out the bitter juices.

Meanwhile combine the oil, vinegar, garlic and seasoning and blend
thoroughly.

Rinse the aubergine slices and dry them thoroughly on kitchen paper.
Place in a large bowl, add half the vinaigrette and toss thoroughly.

Place on the barbecue turning regularly until golden brown on each
side. Brush with extra vinaigrette as necessary.

When cooked, remove the aubergine slices from the barbecue and toss
with any remaining dressing. Sprinkle with the chopped chives and
serve immediately.
