Title: AUTUMN FRUIT CORNISH HENS
Categories: Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
8    Cornish game hens
-(each about 1 lb)
12 lg Garlic cloves, peeled
-and finely minced
4 tb Oregano, dried
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
1 c  Red wine vinegar
1/2 c  Olive oil
1 c  Prunes, pitted
1 c  Apricots, dried
1 c  Green olives, pitted
1/2 c  Capers (plus a bit
-of the juice)
8    Bay leaves
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  White wine, dry
4 tb Italian parsley (chopped)
Clean hens well under cold water.  Pat dry.

In a large bowl, combine hens, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper,
vinegar, oil, prunes, apricots, olives, capers (with juice) and bay
leaves.  Cover and refrigerate overnight to marinate.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Arrange game hens in 1 or 2 shallow
roasting pans. Spoon all the marinade over the hens. Sprinkle evenly
with brown sugar and pour wine around them. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4
hours, basting frequently, until golden. Juice should look clear when
thigh is pricked with a fork. Transfer hens, fruit, olives and capers
to a serving platter. Moisten with pan juices and sprinkle with
parsley. Pass remaining pan juices in a sauce boat.

NOTES:

*  Cornish game hens stewed in fruit and sugar -- I originally got
this recipe from the Sunday magazine of the local paper. I served it
last year for Christmas dinner, and it's very good. What's more, this
recipe is easy: you just put everything in a bowl, marinate
overnight, then bake until done!

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
