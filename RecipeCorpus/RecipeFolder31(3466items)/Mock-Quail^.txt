Title: Mock Quail^
Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1    Pork or veal loin
Stuffing
Flour
Salt & pepper
Butter
Water
Cut meat into pieces about 4" long. Make an incision sideways to
create a cavity. Fill with your favorite stuffing and close with a
toothpick. Roll in flour, season and bake, basting with butter and
water. It isn't quail, but you may fool them. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
