* Reduced-fat or fat-free mayonnaise does not have the consistency
necessary for this recipe; regular mayonnaise is best.

In a medium bowl, stir the cream cheese until soft, then beat in the
mayonnaise until just blended.  Do not overmix.  Fold in the remaining
ingredients, except the garnish, until well combined. Put the dip in
a 9" x 13" baking dish or oven-proof serving dish.  Smooth out the
top but do not pack down.  The dip can be covered and refrigerated up
to 2 days at this point. Shortly before serving, preheat the oven to
425+. Bake the dip until it just starts to bubble around the edges
and the cheese has melted, 8-12 minutes.  Sprinkle with minced
parsley or green onions and serve immediately, with toasted bread or
crackers alongside for spreading.
