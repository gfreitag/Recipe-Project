Rinse chicken and pat dry. Place chicken in a single layer in a large
noncorrosive baking dish. Set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together all remaining ingredients until
thoroughly combined. Pour over chicken and turn each piece so it is
well coated. Cover and allow to marinate for at least 4 hours at room
temperature or 24 hours in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.

Bake chicken, in marinade, on the middle rack of a preheated 400'F
oven 45 to 50 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. If meat is
not entirely browned, place it under a preheated broiler 3 inches
from the heat and cook until golden. Garnish with additional cilantro
leaves.
