Title: Custard Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Milk
1 c  Heavy cream
6    Egg yolks
2    Eggs
10 tb Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
MMMMM-------------------------FLAVORING------------------------------
Vanilla, rum, brandy, or
-whatever, to taste,
-about 1 tablespoon
Heat the milk and cream in a saucepan but do not let boil.

Combine the egg yolks, eggs, sugar, and salt in the top of a double
boiler. Beat well. Pour in the hot milk and cream, whisking steadily.
Place over, not in, simmering water and stir continuously until the
egg yolks are cooked, that is, until mixture thickens somewhat, coats
a spoon, and feels hot to the touch.

Remove from the double boiler and continue to whisk off the heat.
Stir in the desired flavoring: vanilla, rum, brandy, whatever. If the
custard is to be served cool, continue to whisk occasionally as it
cools to allow steam to evaporate; otherwise, it can become watery.
