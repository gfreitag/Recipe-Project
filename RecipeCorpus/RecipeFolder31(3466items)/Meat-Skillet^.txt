Title: Meat Skillet^
Categories: Meats, Vegetables, Tasteofhome, Stove top, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 sm Onion, chopped
2 c  Cooked beef, veal, lamb or
Chicken
1 sl Thick bread
1 c  Milk
1 1/2 ts Curry powder
Salt to taste
1 tb Lemon juice
Hot cooked vegetables
Put meat and onion together through food chopper, or mix thoroughly.
Soak bread in milk and add both to meat; add eggs and seasonings. If
curry isn't very salty, you might add some salt. Heat a little fat in
the skillet, add meat and pat down flat. Cook slowly until brown and
crusty on the bottom. You may need to add more fat. Slice across
center and fold in half. Put on serving platter and surround with
vegetables; green beans, wax beans, carrots; whatever you have. Many
of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
