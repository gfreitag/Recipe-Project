Title: T-Bone Steaks With Perini's Steak Rub`
Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Pepper -- coarsely ground
2 ts All-Purpose Flour
2 ts Salt
1 ts Garlic Powder
1 ts Onion Powder
1 ts Sweet Hungarian Paprika
1 ts Granulated Beef Stock Base
Or
1    Beef Bouillon Cube --
-crushed well
1/2 ts Dried Oregano
1/2 ts Lemon Pepper
6    (14-Oz) T-Bone Steaks,
-About 1-Inch Thick
1/4 c  Unsalted Butter -- melted
1. Make the steak rub: In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients
except the steaks and butter. Rub the mixture all over the steaks.
Let stand at room temperature while building the fire.

2. Build a hot charcoal fire.

3. Cook the steaks on a lightly oiled grill, basting occasionally
with the melted butter, until the undersides are well browned, about
4 mins. Turn and continue cooking and basting for about 4 more mins
for rare meat. (One way to tell the doneness of steak is to press
it--the softer the steak feels, the rarer it is. Medium steak will
give slightly, and well-done meat is firm.)

NOTE: The steaks can be cooked over high heat on a gas grill.

Makes 6 servings from Tom Perini of Perini's Steak House of Buffalo
