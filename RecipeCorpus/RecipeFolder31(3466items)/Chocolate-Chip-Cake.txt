Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
3 c  Cake Flour -- sifted
3 ts Baking Powder
1/2 lb Lightly Salted Butter
2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
1 c  Milk
2 ts Vanilla Extract
2    1-Oz Unsweetened Chocolate
Squares -- grated
Preheat oven to 350 F. Combine flour and baking powder and sift 3
times. Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add 1 egg at a time,
beating well after each addition. This mixture must be kept at a very
light, fluffy consistency. Fold in dry ingredients, alternating with
the milk. Add vanilla. Then fold in grated chocolate. Pour into a
greased and lightly floured 10-inch tube or 8 X 10 X 2 1/2-inch
square pan. Bake for 1 hour (tube) or 40 mins (flat pan), or until
edges shrink from the sides of the pan and cake is firm to the touch
in the center. Serve plain or with Chocolate Frosting. (separate
recipe)
