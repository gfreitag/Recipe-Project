Title: Oriental Hot Wings
Categories: Asian, Appetizers, Hot/spicy
2 lb (to 3 lbs) chicken wings
MARINADE
Yield: 1 servings
:
1 c  soy sauce
1/2 c  sugar
1/4 c  sesame seeds
1 ts cayenne pepper

Cut wings into 3 pieces.  Discard the wingtips and marinate the
remaining pieces for at least 30 minutes.  Agitate the pieces
occasionally while they are marinating.

Cover a cookie pan with foil and, using tongs, place the marinated
wing pieces on it.   I suggest using a cookie PAN, as opposed to a
sheet, because the sides will insure that none of the marinade
mixture drips off the edge and screws up your oven.  There should be
a slight seperation between each individual piece so they don't stick
together.

Cook for one hour at 350 F, turning the wing pieces every 10 minutes.
If you want them to come out nice and even, you need to turn them
individually with a pair of tongs.  If you don't turn them, they'll
stick and burn on one side.

After they are done, let stand for at least 20 minutes.  Serve hot or
at room temperature.
