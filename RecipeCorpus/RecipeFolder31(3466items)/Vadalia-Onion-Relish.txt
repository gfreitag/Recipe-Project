Title: Vadalia Onion Relish
Categories: Can/preserv, Vegetables, Relishes
Yield: 1 recipe
4 md Vadalia onions, finely
-chopped
2 c  Shredded cabbage
1/4 c  Salt (Yes 1/4 cup)
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
2 c  Cider vinegar
1 tb Dried mustard powder
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/4 c  Flour
2 tb Celery seed
2 ts Mustard seed
Combine chopped onions and shredded cabbage in a large glass or
crockery bowl - not metal.  Dissolve salt in one quart of water and
pour over the vegetables, mixing well.  Cover and let soak overnight.

In the morning, turn the vegetables into a large colander and drain.
In a large pot, dissolve the brown sugar in cider vinegar.  Mix
mustard and turmeric with 1/2 water, then add the flour, mixing well
to make a thick paste with no lumps.  Add this to the vinegar and
brown sugar mixture and stir to blend, again making sure there are no
lumps.

Add celery and mustard seeds and bring it all to a oil over medium
heat, stirring to keep it from sticking.  The mixture will thicken as
it comes to a boil.  When it does boil, add cabbage and onions and
continue to boil and stir for five minutes.  (This mixture is very
pungent and will clear your head in nothing flat while you stir)

Put in sterilized jars, top with sterilized lids, and process in hot
water bath for 15 minutes to seal.

Makes 1 1/2 quarts.
