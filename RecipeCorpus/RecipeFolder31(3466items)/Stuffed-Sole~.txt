Title: Stuffed Sole~
Categories: Fish, Seafood, Low cal/fat
Yield: 6 servings
1 pk Cornbread stuffing mix
2 tb Butter or margarine
1 pk Frozen chopped spinach --
Thawed
6    4-oz Sole fillets
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Dry white wine
Pepper
Prepare the stuffing according to package directions, except use only
2 tablespoons butter and 1 1/2 cups water.  Squeeze the spinach to
remove most of the liquid.  Stir the spinach into the stuffing and
let cool. Preheat the oven to 400F.  Rinse the fish in cold water and
pat dry with paper towels.  Lay the fillets flat on a work surface.
Press a generous 1/2 cup stuffing evenly over the top of each fillet,
leaving 1 inch at the thickest ends clear. Beginning at the thin tail
end, gently roll up the fillets.  Pierce the rolls with a toothpick
or small skewer if needed to hold secure. Stand the fish rolls on
their ends, so the spiral design shows, in a lightly oiled baking
dish. Combine the lemon juice with the wine and drizzle over fish.
Sprinkle with pepper. Cover the pan and bake in the oven until the
sole is opaque through the center, 12-15 minutes.
