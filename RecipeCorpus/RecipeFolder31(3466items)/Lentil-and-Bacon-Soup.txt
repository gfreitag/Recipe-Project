Lentil and Bacon Soup is a substantial main meal soup and is
nourishing and filling. Serve it in winter to keep cold weather at
bay.

Preparation:

Peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and slice the carrots into 6mm
pieces.

1. Put the lentils in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to the
boil.
Boil for 3 minutes then drain thoroughly.

2. In another large saucepan heat 2 tbls of the olive oil and cook the
onion, bacon and half the garlic for 5 minutes. Add the remaining
olive oil, garlic, carrots, celery, tomatoes, lentils, 1 litre of
water and seasoning. Cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes, until the
lentils are soft.

3. Meanwhile make the croutons. Heat the oil to 190C/375F. Remove the
crusts from the bread and cut into 12mm. Deep fry until croutons
are
an even light brown then remove the basket or use a slotted spoon
and
drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle the croutons over the soup before
serving.

Tip:

For added flavour, shake the croutons in salt and pepper as they
drain on kitchen paper.
