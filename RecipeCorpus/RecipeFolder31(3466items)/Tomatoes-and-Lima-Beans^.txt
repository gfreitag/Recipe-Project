Title: Tomatoes and Lima Beans^
Categories: Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
4    Tomatoes
1 1/2 c  Lima beans, cooked
1 tb Parsley, chopped
2 tb Onion, grated
1/2 c  Nuts, chopped fine
2 tb Celery, minced
Salt & pepper to taste
French Dressing
Cut a slice from the top of each tomato and remove pulp with a spoon.
Mix beans, parsley, onion, nuts and celery with French dressing to
moisten. Fill tomatoes with the mixture and chill. Serve with more
dressing. (Any kind of dressing may be used) If you prefer, peel and
slice tomatoes thickly and pile mixture on top. Many of the recipes
in this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I
have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
