Title: Smoky Tarragon Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Chickens
1    Lemon
1/4 c  Minced fresh taragon
1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley
1/2 c  Olive oil
Salt and pepper Fruitwood chips, soaked in water

Cut chickens into quarters.  Chop off backbones and flatten breasts
with a smart blow from the flat of a cleaver or by pressing with the
palm of your hand.  Remove last joint from wings (wingtips).  Cut
several slits in the chicken legs.

Squeeze juice from the lemon.  Mince the parsley and tarragon
together. Mix together the lemon juice, olive oil and the tarragon
and parsley. Rub the mixture into the chicken.  Cover and marinate.

Recipe can be prepared to this point several hours ahead.

Start the fire in the grill.  Season the chicken pieces with salt and
pepper.  Put the dark meat chicken pieces on the grill about 6 inches
from the coals and cook, turning with tongs every 5 minutes, about 25
minutes in all.  After cooking dark meat for about 12 minutes, throw
the soaked fruitwood chips onto the coals; add the chicken breast
pieces, cover the grill, and let the smoke permeate the meat for at
least 5 minutes. Remove the grill cover and continue cooking until
the meat tests done, about 7 minutes more.  There is no need to baste
since the chicken skin has enough fat to self baste.

Yield: 4 servings.
