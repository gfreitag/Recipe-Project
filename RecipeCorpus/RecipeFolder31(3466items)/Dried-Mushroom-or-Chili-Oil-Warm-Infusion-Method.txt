Title: Dried Mushroom or Chili Oil-Warm Infusion Method
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
4    Fresh hot chilies
-(unseeded) or
8    Dried chilies
OR
1 oz Dried mushrooms
1 c  Olive oil
Chop mushrooms or chilies in a food processor until fine. Place in a
pot with the oil and heat until mixture begins to bubble. Let cook
10-15 seconds and remove from heat. Swirl until just warm. Strain
into a bowl through 4 layers of cheesecloth. Squeeze well to extract
as much oil as possible. Pour into a sterilized jar or bottle; seal
tightly, refrigerate, and use with 1 week for best flavor.

Makes about 3/4 cup mushroom oil or about 1 cup chili oil.

Note 1: Experiment with combinations of dried, fresh, and smoked
chilies to add different flavor dimensions to your oil, not just
heat. Try fresh poblanos, jalapeos, and serranos or dried anchos and
pasillas. Roast one of the fresh or dried chilies to add flavor. Add
black pepper to the mix; it makes a truly amazing oil. Mushroom oil
can be made from packaged, dried mushrooms such as porcini and
shiitake.

Note 2: If you filter through coffee filters, rinse them and squeeze
dry before use. You will need some patience and probably several
filters. Pour the oil little by little and stir occasionally. You
will recover almost all the oil if you use dried chilies, however,
the more fresh chilies, the less chili oil since the oil will bind
and be hard to separate after being infused.
