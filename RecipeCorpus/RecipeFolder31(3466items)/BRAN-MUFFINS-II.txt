NOTES:

*  Tasty muffins with bran and dried fruit -- This is a simple New
Zealand recipe based on golden syrup.  The muffins make a delicious
alternative to scones.  We eat them buttered, either hot or cold.
I've added the dried fruit to the original recipe as it makes them
much more interesting.

*  Golden syrup is a very thick sugar syrup that is readily available
in countries where people drive on the left-hand side of the road,
but seems to be rare elsewhere. If the gourmet section of your
supermarket does not carry it, you could try substituting some kind
of honey, such as sage honey.

*  Any dried fruit can be used instead of sultanas, e.g. raisins,
dates - whatever strikes your fancy.
