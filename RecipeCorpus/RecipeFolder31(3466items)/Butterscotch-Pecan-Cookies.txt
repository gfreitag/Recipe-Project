MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Dark brown sugar,
"firmly packed"
1 c  Salted butter, softened
2 lg Eggs
2 ts Scotch whiskey
1 c  Chopped pecans
1 c  Whole pecans
MMMMM-----------------------CARAMEL GLAZE----------------------------
8 oz Caramel candies
1/4 c  Heavy cream
Preheat your oven to 300 degrees.  In a mixing bowl combine the
flour, soda, and salt.  Mix well with a wire whisk and set aside.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the sugar and butter
together.  Mix to form a grainy paste, scraping down the sides of the
bowl. Add the eggs and whiskey, and beat on medium speed until soft
and lumpy. Add the flour mixture and chopped pecans, and mix at low
speed just till mixed.  Do not overmix.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons 2 inches apart on ungreased
cookie sheets.  Place a whole pecan atop each cookie in the center.
Bake for 23-25 minutes or until the edges begin to turn brown.
Transfer immediately to a cool, flat surface with a spatula.
To prepare the glaze: melt the caramels with the cream in a small
saucepan over low heat.  Stir with a wooden spoon till smooth.
Remove from heat.
Drizzle the cooled cookies with the glaze in the desired pattern
using a spoon or fork.
Note: You may substitute an equal amount of vanilla extract for
the whiskey.
