Yield: 1 batch
50    Cotton balls, plain
OR
Cotton wool, 3 by 6 feet
2 lb Bittersweet chocolate
1/2 c  Liqueur, any favorite
-[optional]
If starting from cotton wool, divide it into about 50 pieces, making
sure they are well formed, round, and the rough edges have been
worked back into the mass to make a smooth surface.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler being careful not to get any
water in the chocolate.

In batches of about ten put the balls of cotton on a fine rack or
grate. Sprinkle with the liqueur if you're using it.  [Be careful!
Too much will overpower the other flavors.]

Slowly pour enough chocolate over each ball of cotton to coat it
thoroughly, letting excess drip off. Allow the chocolate coating to
cool before taking the chocolate covered cotton from the rack.

Keep stored in a closed container in a cool place away from light.
Munitions boxes work well for this.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate covered cotton -- This is a recipe I invented after I had
cornered the cotton market and couldn't get rid of the stuff.

While good orlon can be substituted for the cotton, the resulting
product won't have the same flavor or texture as the real thing.
Your friends will be able to tell that you've been skimping. Egyptian
cotton works best. Yield: About fifty servings.

*  As a special cold-weather treat, use wool instead of cotton.
