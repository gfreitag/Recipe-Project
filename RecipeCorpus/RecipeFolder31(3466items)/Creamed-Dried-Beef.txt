Title: Creamed Dried Beef
Categories: Meats
Yield: 3 servings
4 oz Dried or smoked dried beef
Torn *
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb All-purpose flour
1 c  Milk
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
3 ea Toast slices
*Take the dried beef and drop it into a pot of boiling water.  Boil
the bejabbers out of it for 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from boiling
water and place on several thicknesses of paper towels.  Using a
rolling pin, press all the moisture from the beef and pat dry. (This
is not in the original recipe.)

Cook dried beef in butter till edges frizzle.  Push meat to one side;
blend flour into butter.  Add milk all at once.  Cook, stirring
constantly, till thick and bubbly, gradually incorporating dried
beef.  Add Worcestershire and dash pepper.  Spoon over buttered toast.

TIPS:  If dried beef is not your thing, you can substitute lean
ground beef browned in a skillet.  For breakfast, substitute browned
lean bulk sausage.
