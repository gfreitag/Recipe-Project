MMMMM--------------------PREPARING ASPARAGUS-------------------------
Trim off the tough, fibrous portion at the bottom of the asparagus
spear. Gently peel up from base, using a vegetable peeler or paring
knife, tapering off about 3 inches from the tip; this helps stalks
cook evenly from tip to base.

Blanching is the best way to retain color and flavor. Start with a pot
large enough to hold the asparagus spears horizontally. Fill the pot
3/4 full of water, add a teaspoon of salt per quart of water and
bring to a boil. Add the asparagus, cover just until the water begins
to boil again, then -- to retain the beautiful green color -- remove
the lid. (A lid bounces the volatile gases back down into the pot and
causes a reaction with the chlorophyll, resulting in olive-green
stalks.) Reduce the heat and cook 4 minutes, then begin testing for
doneness by piercing spears with a sharp knife. The asparagus is done
when just easily pierced.

If you're not using the asparagus immedately in a recipe, plunge it
in cold water to stop the cooking process. When spears are completely
cold, remove with a slotted spoon to a clean towel placed on a rack;
cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

You can also use this method to blanch asparagus before adding to
stir fry dishes or quick sautes, but remove the spears from water
while they are still firm.
