Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.  Process the meat in 2-3 small
batches until fairly smooth.  Add the meat to th rest of the
ingredien in the bowl.  Add the rest of the ingredients except the
oil and knead mixture until all the ingredients are mixed thoroughly
and mixture is smooth. Chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat over to 475 F.  Line a roasting pan with foil.  Divide the
kab mix into about 18 balls, each slighly larger than a glf ball.
Mold a into a skewer and form into a sausage shape by gently rolling
between palms ( about 405" long) and place in the preheat pan.  Make
the rest the kababs the same way.  Brush generously with the oil and
place the roasting pan just below the top rung of the oven.  Cook 6-8
minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and brush the kababs liberally
with the remaining oil and cook for a further 6-8 minutes.  Allow the
kababs to cool slightly before removing from skewers.
