Crust: Whirl the cookies in a food processor to make a powder.

Melt the butter and mix with the cookies. Press three inches up the
side and on the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.

Remove the ice cream or frozen yogurt from the freezer and let it
soften slightly. Starting with the chocolate, spoon the ice cream or
yogurt into the springform pan, pressing down until smooth. Repeat
with rest of the ice cream or yogurt.  Refreeze, wrapped well. You
can do this at least a week ahead.

To make the fudge sauce, melt the butter and the chocolate in a
saucepan over low heat. Add the cream and beat until shiny. Cool
slightly and add the vanilla. Just before serving, whip the cream and
pipe it around the mold. Garnish with fresh raspberries and serve
with sauce on the side.

Tip: You can also line the pan with lady fingers and use any kind of
ice cream or frozen yogurt that suits your fancy.
