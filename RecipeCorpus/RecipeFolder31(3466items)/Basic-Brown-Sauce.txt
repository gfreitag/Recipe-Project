Title: Basic Brown Sauce
Categories: French, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Butter
2 md Carrots -- diced
1 md Onion -- chopped
2    Sprigs Parsley
1 pn Thyme
1 sm Bay leaf
2 tb Flour
1 c  Dry white wine
1 1/2 c  Consomme
1 tb Tomato paste
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
In small, heavy saucepan, melt butter. Add carrots, onions, parsley,
thyme, and bay leaf. Cook over low flame, stirring constantly, until
vegetables are golden brown. Stir in flour and cook until slightly
brown. Stir in wine and consomme. Add tomato paste, salt, and pepper.
Bring to boil. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain. Makes about 2
cups of sauce. Brown sauce may be prepared in advance and keeps well
in refrigerator for more than two weeks. Comments: Brown sauce made
in the "grande maniere" has always been practically impossible to
prepare at home. It requires the previous preparation of stock, then
the reducing of the stock to glaze or half-glaze, and then the making
of the sauce itself. The housewife solves the problem by dispensing
with glaze or half-glaze and using instead strong bouillon, consomme,
or bouillon cubes. Canned beef consomme makes excellent brown sauce.
The characteristic flavor of consomme fades away into the flavors of
the other ingredients, leaving only that much of the taste which is
part of the sauce. Recipe Source: THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING by
