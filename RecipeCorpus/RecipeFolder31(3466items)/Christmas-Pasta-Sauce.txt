This is the other recipe I described.  According to the author, this
ragu from Emilia Romagna is served by many Italians with the
traditional pasta course at Christmas. It is really good. Enjoy-

1. Soak the porcini in warm water for at least 1/2 hour. Remove from
the water, squeeze dry and chop. 2. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan or
flameproof casserole, heat the olive oil over moderate heat. Add the
carrot, onion and celery and saute until the onion is golden, about 4
minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 3.
Add the sausage, ground beef and pancetta to the pan. Cook over
moderate heat, stirring to break up the meat, until the beef and
sausage are no longer pink. Drain off any fat. Season with the salt,
pepper and nutmeg. 4. Pour in red wine and cook, stirring
occasionally, until it evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato
paste, tomatoes, porcini and 1/2 cup of warm water. Simmer for 30
minutes. If the sauce gets too thick, add a little more water. (The
recipe can be made to this point up to 2 days ahead. Cover and
refrigerate; reheat before serving.)  Add the parsley just before
serving.
