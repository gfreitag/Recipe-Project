Title: Vegetable Oil Pie Crust
Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart
Yield: 2 9" shells
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Veg. oil
3 tb Cold milk
The oil gives this pastry a somewhat mealy rather than flaky texture.
Preheat oven to 425. Sift the flour and salt into a pie pan. Mix the
oil and milk in a cup until creamy. Pour the oil mixture over the
flour all at once and stir the ingredients lightly with a fork until
blended. Form into a crust right in the pan by patting out the dough
with your fingers. Bake 12 to 15 min and cool before filling.
