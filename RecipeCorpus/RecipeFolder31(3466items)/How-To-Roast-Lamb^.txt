Choose a roast that weighs at least 4 pounds. Wipe it of with a damp
cloth and trim off fat; rub well with salt and pepper. Put in a heavy
roasting pan, fat side up. If lean, put strips of bacon over the top.
Sear in a hot (450F.) oven until brown, then reduce heat and bake for
about 35 minutes per pound of meat. A boned or rolled roast will take
longer. When it's tender, put on hot serving platter and make gravy
from the drippings: add water to pan and scrape up all the juices and
baked pieces, bring to a boil and thicken with flour and water mixed
to a smooth paste; let it boil a few minutes. Season to taste and
strain. Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain
amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in
the book, typos and all.
