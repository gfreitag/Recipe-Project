MMMMM----------------------ELEPHANT GARLIC---------------------------
Elephant garlic is really a variety of leek that sets huge underground
cloves and tastes like mild garlic. Elephant garlic is big and the
cloves are easy to peel, but some say the cloves are too juicy to
saute nicely however when used raw, the juicy mildness is a great
asset.

To encourage the largest cloves possible, it helps to pick the flower
buds before they open. Most elephant garlic will begin to flower in
late May and into June. Pick the flower just as soon as the buds
begin to swell and keep it like a bouquet in water in the
refrigerator. They are delicious when quickly cooked and marinated
into refrigerator pickles. The buds are sometimes labled "garlic
tops", "garlic whistles"," garlic bud spears" or "garlic flower buds".

Edible garlic buds are a most seasonal product - short season - so if
you wait too long to pick them they'll be too fibrous and tough. If
you miss the best picking time, just let them go on and become
flowers. A late-summer bouquet of 3 foot tall dried garlic flowers is
dramatically beautiful.

If you decide to plant some elephant garlic yourself, wait until fall.
Usually plant by the shortest day of the year and harvest the cloves
shortly after the longest day of the year. You can prevent bitterness
by always curing and keeping garlic cloves in the dark.
