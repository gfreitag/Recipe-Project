Title: COCO-CHIPS
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1/4 lb Margarine (one stick)
1 1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1 c  Coconut, shredded
1 1/4 c  Chocolate chips
1 3/4 c  Condensed milk,
-sweetened (1 can)
Melt the margarine in a 9x13-inch pan.  Combine with graham cracker
crumbs and spread evenly on bottom of pan. Sprinkle coconut evenly
over crumbs. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over coconut.  Pour
condensed milk evenly over everything. Bake for 30 minutes at 350
degrees F.

Let cool for a bit.  Cut into squares and enjoy.  Mom insists on using
"Borden Eagle Brand" sweetened condensed milk. Don't ask me why.

NOTES:

*  A nicely fattening combination of coconut and chocolate chips --
This comes from Mom. (She doesn't know where she got it; she
memorized it years ago and lost the original recipe.) It's always
been a favorite with us kids, and last time I was home she gave me
the recipe. It's so simple that even a complete clutz like myself was
able to make it perfectly the first time.

: Difficulty:  trivial.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
