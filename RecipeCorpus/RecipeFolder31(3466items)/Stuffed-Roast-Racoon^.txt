Title: Stuffed Roast Racoon^
Categories: Game, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Sweet potatoes, mashed
1/2 c  Raisins
1 c  Bread crumbs
2    Apples, peeled and chopped
1/4 c  Butter, melted
Salt and pepper to taste
4 lb To 5 racoon
First make the stuffing; mix together all ingredients (except racoon,
of course) gently until blended. Set aside. Wash racoon meat
thoroughly and dry with a cloth. cut off some of the fat, leaving
just enough for a thin layer. Salt the inside of the coon. Stuff
gently with the sweet potato mixture and sew opening shut. Bake at
325F. for about 3-4 hours. When half done, turn over so all sides
will be browned. Serve with a crisp vegetable salad. Many of the
recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
