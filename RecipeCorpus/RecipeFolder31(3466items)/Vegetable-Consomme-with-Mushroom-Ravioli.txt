saucepan over medium heat until softened, about 10 minutes. Add
remaining oil, carrot, parsnip and turnip; cook 5 minutes. Add
tomatoes with juice, salt, marjoram and 8 cups water. Bring to a
boil. Lower heat; simmer, covered, 45 minutes. Strain through a
fine-meshed sieve, pushing on solids to extract all liquid. Discard
solids. Set aside.

Ravioli: Saute shallots in oil in skillet over medium-low heat until
softened, about 6 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook 10 minutes until
mushrooms are soft and almost all liquid has evaporated. Stir in
salt, pepper and Port. Cook 5 minutes over high heat until liquid has
evaporated. Cool to room temperature.

Lay 12 wonton sheets on a dry work surface. Cut each wonton in half
lengthwise. Lay a scan teaspoonful of mushroom mixture on top-half of
each wonton half. Dampen with water 4 sides of top half of wonton
where mushroom filling is; fold dry half over filling; press down
edges to seal. Repeat with remaining wonton wrappers and filling.

Bring consomme to a boil in a large saucepan. Drop ravioli in; cook 2
minutes. Drop in diced carrot, parsnip and leek; cook 2 minutes.
