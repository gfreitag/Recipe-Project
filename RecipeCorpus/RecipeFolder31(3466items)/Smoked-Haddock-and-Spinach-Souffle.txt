Notes:

Preparation Time: 30 minutes Cooking Time: 1 1/2 hours

Preparation:

Separate the eggs.

1. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and place a baking tray on the
middle shelf. Brush a 1.2l souffle dish with the melted butter and
coat with the breadcrumbs. Lay the smoked haddock in a shallow
ovenproof dish and cover with half of the milk. Add the bay leaf,
onion and peppercorns, cover lightly with a lid or foil and bake in
the oven for 30 minutes or until the fish is cooked. Strain the milk
through a sieve and reserve. Mash the haddock finely with the back of
a fork, then set it aside.

2. Rinse and shake exccess water from the spinach and put it into a
large non-aluminium pan. Set it over a low heat and cook gently for 5
minutes or until soft. Drain, allow to cool a little, then chop
finely.

3. Melt the butter, stir in the flour and cook for 30 seconds. Take
the pan from the heat and bring the sauce to the boil. Simmer it for
1 minute and then remove it from the heat, season and add the mustard
powder. Allow the sauce to cool slightly, and then beat in the egg
yolks. Stir in the mashed haddock and spinach.

4. Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff. Fold two large
spoonfuls into the sauce to slacken it, then gently fold in the
remaining egg whites. Spoon the mixture into the prepared souffle
dish, place on the heated baking tray and cook for 40-45 minutes or
until well-risen and rich-brown in colour.

Serve immediately.
