Title: Vegetable Barley
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
1 c  Uncooked pearl barley
1 tb Vegetable oil
-or olive oil
1 1/2 tb Onion(s), diced
1/2 c  Mushrooms, diced
1/4 c  Zucchini, diced
1/4 c  Carrots, diced
1 tb Soy sauce
Salt to taste
In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the barley with 4 cups of water. Bring
to a boil; reduce heat to keep the water at a low boil until the
barley is cooked, about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally while the
barley is cooking to prevent it from sticking. Drain.

In an 8-inch skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion,
mushrooms, zucchini, and carrots. Saut, stirring often, until lightly
browned and just cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked barley and
stir to combine.

Season with soy sauce and serve immediately.
