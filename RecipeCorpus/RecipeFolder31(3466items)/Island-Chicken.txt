Place cilantro, garlic, lemongrass and shallot in a food processor or
blender and pulse for about a minute, scraping down the sides as
necessary. Transfer to a large baking dish and stir in the coconut
milk, oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Add chicken breast halves;
coat well. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Remove the chicken and refrigerate.  Place the marinade, chicken
broth and ginger in a saucepan and boil 20 to 25 minutes, or until
reduced to 1 cup. Skim off the fat and strain.

Cut the mushrooms, carrot, snow peas, peppers and celery into
julienned strips, keeping each kind of vegetable and the bean sprouts
separate. Slice the tomato in half crosswise and squeeze out the
seeds; chop the flesh coarsely.

Heat olive oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat.  Saute the
chicken 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until cooked through.  Remove and
slice into 1/2" strips.  Keep warm.

Heat sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over high heat.  Stir-fry
the mushrooms and carrot for 1 1/2 minutes.  Add remaining
vegetables, except for the tomato pieces, and stir-fry for 1 1/2
minutes longer. Mix in the ginger and garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
Stir in the tomato and cilantro and cook for 1 minute.  Add soy sauce
and blend. Remove the pan from the burner.

Reheat the strained sauce over medium heat.  Whisk in the butter and
lime juice.  Serve chicken over white rice with the stir-fried
vegetables and sauce.

Kane and Dob write: "The many ingredients in here make for a
sensational tropical treat.  All you'll need to accompany it is
plenty of white rice and beer.  You may marinate the chicken and
prepare the sauce a day ahead if you like."
