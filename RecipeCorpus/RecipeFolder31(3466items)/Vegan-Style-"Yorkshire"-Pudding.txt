Title: Vegan Style "Yorkshire" Pudding
Categories: Side dish, Vegetarian, Puddings
Yield: 1 recipe
1 c  All-purpose white flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
Salt
Baking soda
Cream of tartar
1/4 c  Tofu, mashed
Salt & pepper
Water, as needed, at least
-- 1/2 cup
Combine all ingredients in a blender & blend until very well combined.

Place some oil in an 8 X 8 inch baking pan.  Place in a hot oven
until the oil is extremely hot, but not burning.  When hot, carefully
pour the batter into the pan, being careful not to get splattered in
the process. As it is best to keep the oil hot, you may want to have
the pan sitting on an "on" element while adding the batter.  Return
the pan to the oven & bake for 25 minutes, or until the pudding tests
done. (My timing on this is weird. Sometimes I need 20 minutes,
sometimes longer, so keep an eye on it).

Alternatively, heat a small amount of oil in muffin tins & then pour
in about 1 1/2 tb batter in each muffin "cup".  The puddings then
will need about 10 minutes or so, but again, be prepared to give it
longer if it needs it.

NOTE:  I believe that there are two keys to being successful when
making any batter pudding.  One, ensure that you use a hot oven, 425F
or even 450F is best.  Secondly, ensure that the oil is really hot.
