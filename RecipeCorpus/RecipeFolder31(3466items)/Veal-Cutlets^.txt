Title: Veal Cutlets^
Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 lb Veal cutlets, cut thick
1    Egg, beaten well
Cracker crumbs
Salt
Pepper
Season cutlets with salt and pepper. Dip into egg, then into crumbs,
coating thoroughly. Shake off all loose crumbs. Fry in hot fat and
cook the meat golden brown. Veal must always be thoroughly done.
Serve with gravy or tomato sauce. These are wonderfully "sticky". The
kids will love them and so will you. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
