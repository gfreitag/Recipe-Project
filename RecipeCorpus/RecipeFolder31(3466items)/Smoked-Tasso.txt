Title: Smoked Tasso
Categories: Cajun/creol, Sausage, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
4 lb Pork butt
1/4 c  Cayenne pepper
1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/4 c  Black pepper - cracked
1 tb Louisiana Gold Pepper Sauce
-- or Tabasco
1/4 c  Salt
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Garlic - granulated
Cut pork butt into 1/2-inch thick strips.  Place on a baking pan and
season with Worcestershire and Louisiana Gold sauces.  Once liquids
are well blended into meat, add all remaining ingredients. Mix well
into meat to ensure that each piece is well coated with the seasoning
mixture. Cover with clear wrap and refrigerate overnight. Using a
home style smoker, and using briquettes flavored with pecan wood and
sugar cane strips if possible, smoke tasso at 175-200F for 2-1/2
hours. Once cooked, tasso may be frozen or used to season gumbos,
vegetables, or a great pot of white or red beans.

COMMENT FROM JOHN FOLSE: Tasso is yet another example of the Cajun and
Creole desire for unique flavor in a recipe. Tasso is a dried smoked
product that is seasoned with cayenne pepper, garlic and salt and
heavily smoked. The word tasso is believed to have come from the
Spanish word "tasajo" which is dried, cured beef. Although this
delicacy is often thinly sliced and eaten alone, it is primarily used
as a pungent seasoning for vegetables, gumbos and soups. Today in
South Louisiana, tasso is becoming a popular seasoning for new and
creative dishes. It has also gained wide acclaim as an hors d'oeuvre
served with dipping sauces or fruit glazes. At Lafitte's Landing
Restaurant, we have incorporated tasso into our cream sauces and
compound butters to create a new taste unheard of in classical
cooking.  [Is great in pasta dishes, IMHO.]
