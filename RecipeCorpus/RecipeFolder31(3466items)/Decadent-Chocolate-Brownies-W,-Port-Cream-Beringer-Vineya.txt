Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM---------------------BERINGER VINEYARDS--------------------------
4 oz Chocolate unsweetened
4 oz Chocolate semi-sweet
6 oz Butter, unsalted
1 3/4 c  Sugar, granulated
7    Eggs; beaten
1 tb Vanilla
1 tb Salt
1 c  Flour
1/2 c  Walnuts; chopped (optional)
MMMMM-------------------------PORT CREAM------------------------------
1 c  Wine, Cabernet Port
1 c  Cream, heavy whipping
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter an 8 inch by 13 inch
medium baking pan.

Chop chocolate into bits and heat with butter in a double boiler until
completely melted. Remove from the heat and stir in sugar to partially
dissolve. Beat the eggs with vanilla. Separately stir the flour and
salt together. Stir the eggs into melted chocolate, and then stir in
the flour and walnuts just until combined. Do not over stir. Spread
into the buttered pan and bake 25 to 30 minutes for soft brownies (40
minutes for chewier brownies.)

Cool completely before cutting and serve with a dollop of Port Cream.

Simmer the Port over medium high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Then
chill.

Beat the cream until just thickening, then stream in the sugar,
reduced Port and vanilla. Continue to beat to soft peak.

Wine Suggestion: Serve as a first course with Beringer Cabernet Port
Wine.
