Title: Pasta with Saffron-Tomato Coconut Milk
Categories: Pasta, Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
3 lg Tomatoes
8 oz Fettucine or other pasta
2 ts Vegetable oil
1    Garlic clove
-- finely minced
6    Saffron threads; OR...
1 pn -Powdered saffron
1/4 ts Grated lemon peel
1 c  Coconut milk ("lite" is OK)
1/4 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Fresh basil leaves
Bring a pot of water to a boil (enough to cook the pasta).  Before
adding the pasta, drop the tomatoes into the boiling water for a few
seconds to loosen skins.  Remove tomatoes and set aside; put pasta
into boiling water and cook until tender.  Drain thoroughly and keep
hot while you prepare sauce.

For sauce: Peel skins from tomatoes.  Cut peeled tomatoes into wedges
and remove seeds.  Discard skins and seeds.  Chop tomatoes finely.

In a heavy skillet or saucepan, heat oil over moderately-high heat.
Add tomatoes, garlic and saffron to hot oil and stir constantly until
most of the liquid has evaporated and mixture is reduced by about
half. Stir in coconut milk and lemon peel, and season with salt and
pepper. Simmer gently a couple of minutes, until sauce is heated
through and flavors have blended.

Serve sauce ladled over hot pasta, garnished with a generous amount of
thinly sliced fresh basil.  Pass peppermill separately at table, if
desired.
