MMMMM------------------REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS-----------------------
The recipe comes from Gaziantep. However, this dish is very well known
thoroughout the country. Icli Kofte making is a time consuming
process. It also requires experience and a well-developed hand
manupulation. Therefore good home makers are judged by their success
in making firm, smooth and attractively shaped koftes. In old days
the basic mixture was prepared with only ground meat, fine bulgur,
onions and spices. Nowadays some other ingredients, such as boiled
potatoes, or egg, semolina or flour are included in the recipe in
order to form shells easily and successfully. Instead of steaming,
koftes can be deep fried in oil and drained on paper towel or steamed
koftes can be deep fried instead of sauteeing. This dish is prepared
for guests on special days. It is always served with soup.
