Title: Green Peas with New Potatoes^
Categories: Vegetables, Tasteofhome, Depress/era, Potatoes
Yield: 1 servings
2 sl Salt pork
1 lb Or so new potatoes
2 c  Green peas
Water
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tb To 2 flour
1 c  Milk
Dice up salt pork and fry a little in a kettle. Add potatoes, peas and
enough water. When tender, pour off all but about 1/2 cup water.
Season with salt and pepper, add milk and thicken with flour. If you
put the milk into a jar with the flour and shake it well, the sauce
won't get lumpy.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
