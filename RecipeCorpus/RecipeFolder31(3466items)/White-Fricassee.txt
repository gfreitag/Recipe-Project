It was either a stroke of genius or an accident which is responsible
for the anchovies.  The following recipe is taken from "The Carolina
Housewife", published in the fifties (18), and long out of print.  As
you can see from these ingredients, it was published in a time of
flourishing hospitality.

Juice of 1 lemon

Parboil the chickens, and when they are tender remove them from the
broth, skin them and cut them in pieces for serving.  Return them to
the liquor and add the seasonings, including the wine.  Stew gently
until very tender. Remove the onion and add the cream, the butter and
flour well blended, and when this has come to the boiling point add
the beaten egg yolk, but do not let it boil.  Add the lemon juice,
being very careful not to curdle the mixture.

Rich as this sauce is, it is suggested that mushrooms, a few capers
and oysters shredded in a little of their own liquor may be added.
Serve garnished with toast points.

This chicken dish has unusual flavor, for the anchovies "melt",
leaving no visible trace but a most elusive taste.
