Go to your favorite fishing spot and spend the better part of the day
fishing. Bring home the catch, clean (or better yet, have someone
else do it!). Dredge fish in seasoned flour and fry in butter until
flaky and tender. Serve with new potatoes and maybe some fresh peas.
Watch for those bones. Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
