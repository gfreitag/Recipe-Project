Title: Tarragon Chicken Breasts
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
4    Chicken breast halves with
-skin and bones left
Intact (about 2 pounds
-total)
Salt to taste if desired
Freshly ground pepper to
-taste
1 tb Butter
1 tb Plus 1 Tsp chopped fresh
-tarragon or half the
Amount dried (2 tsp)
1/2 c  Dry white wine
3/4 c  Chicken broth, fresh or
-canned
1/2 c  Heavy cream
Place the chicken breasts on a flat surface and hack off the thin
bones at the bottom of each piece.  Sprinkle the breasts with salt
and pepper.

Heat the butter in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken
pieces in a single layer.  Place the chicken pieces in the skillet
skin side down and cook for about 1 minute until nicely browned.
Turn the chicken and continue cooking for about 4 minutes.  Sprinkle
with 1 tablespoon fresh tarragon or half the amount dried (1 1/2
teaspoons) and pour the wine and broth over all.  Cover closely and
cook for 15 minutes.

Transfer the cooked chicken pieces to a serving dish.  Reduce the
cooking liquid to about 1/2 cup.  Add the cream and bring to a boil.
Remove the sauce from the heat and pour through a sieve into a
saucepan, pressing to extract as much flavor as possible from the
solids.  Pour the sauce over the chicken breast pieces and sprinkle
with the remaining tarragon.

Yield: 4 servings.
