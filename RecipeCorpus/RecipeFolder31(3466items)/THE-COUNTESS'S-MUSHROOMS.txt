Title: THE COUNTESS'S MUSHROOMS
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Usenet
Yield: 2 servings
1 lb Mushrooms, fresh
4 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
2 ts Broth
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Onion powder
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Tarragon
1/4 ts Curry powder
1/2 ts Black pepper,
-freshly ground
1/4 ts Salt (or to taste)
In a large frying pan, melt the butter.  Saute mushrooms in butter
until tender (about 5 minutes).  Mix flour and chicken base together.
Sprinkle over mushrooms. Cook one more minute, stirring. Add sour
cream, lemon juice and all seasonings. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more,
stirring.

We use chicken broth or chicken bouillon.  If you use a vegetable
broth this is a vegetarian dish.

If you can resist digging in right away, cook this ahead of time to
give the flavors a chance to mellow. At serving time, rewarm
carefully over low heat. This is wonderful as a main dish served over
rice, noodles or fettucini Alfredo.
