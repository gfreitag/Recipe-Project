Title: Fresh Flatbread
Categories: Breads, Healthy
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Water -- boiling
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Whole-Wheat Flour
1 c  Dark Rye Flour
Dissolve salt in boiling water. In a large bowl, combine wheat and rye
flours. Stir in water, using a little less or more as needed, to make
a daugh that is soft enough to knead. On a floured surface, knead
dough for 3 or 4 mins. Dough will be somewhat sticky - that's the
nature of rye. Divide the dough into 6 equal parts and form into
balls. With a floured rolling pin, roll out each ball into a very
thin circle, about 10 inches in diameter. Let rest for 5 mins. Pan
spray a skillet and cook flatbreads over high heat, flipping
frequently, until outsides are crispy. Makes 6 flatbreads.
