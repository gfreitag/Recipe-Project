~In this salsa, citrus shows its two sides, the sweetness of the
oranges contrasting with the tartness of lime juice. Chipotle peppers
contribute a dark, distinctive heat. They are sold dried or canned.
Look for them in Latino food stores. - SALSA

~ TO MAKE SALSA: With a sharp knife, remove skin and white pith from
oranges and discard. Working over a medium-sized bowl to catch the
juice, cut the orange segments from their surrounding membrane,
letting the segments fall into the bowl. Add onions, lime juice,
cilantro, Chipotle peppers and garlic. Stir to combine. Season with
salt and pepper. (The salsa can be prepared ahead and stored,
covered, in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours.) TO MAKE SALMON: Heat
a small skillet over medium heat. Add coriander and cumin; toast,
stirring constantly, until aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool and
transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Add peppercorns to the
mill and coarsely grind all the spices. Stir in salt. Prepare grill
or preheat broiler. Coat salmon with the spice mixture. Grill or
broil on a lightly oiled rack until the fish is opaque in the center,
about 5 minutes per side. Serve with the salsa. Serves 4. 251
