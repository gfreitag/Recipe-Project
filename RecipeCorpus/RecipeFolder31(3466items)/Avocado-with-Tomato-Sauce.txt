Title: Avocado with Tomato Sauce
Categories: Vegetarian, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
2 lg Avocados
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
16 oz Tinned Plum Tomatoes
1    Shallot
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Fresh Thyme
Salt
Ground Black Pepper
Preparation Time: 10 minutes plus chilling To prevent avocados
discolouring brush with oil or lemon juice. Preparation: Chop the
shallot. Freezing: Sauce can be frozen for up to six months.

1. First make the sauce: place the tomatoes and their juice, the
shallot, sugar, thyme and salt and pepper in a food processor or
blender and blend until smooth. Sieve, then chill in the fridge for
30 minutes.

2. Halve the avocados by slicing around the stone then twisting
apart. Make a nest with a tea towel on a chopping board and sit an
avocado half in it. Hit the stone with a large cook's knife then ease
it out.

3. Score the skin into segments with a small sharp knife then peel.
The tougher the avocado skin, the narrower the strips need to be cut.

4. Place the peeled avocado halves on a plate and make equal
lengthwise cuts, leaving the narrow end intact.

5. Gently push the avocado slices apart with your fingers so that the
slices fan out. Surround with a pool of the sauce then serve.
