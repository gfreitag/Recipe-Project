1. Prepare Poaching Liquid: In 3-quart saucepan, combine carrots,
celery, onion, thyme, parsley, salt, water, and wine. Heat to
simmering, cover; cook 20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, prepare Vinaigrette: In small bowl, combine cucumber and
shallot. Stir in vinegar, salt, and pepper until well mixed. Stir in
oil and set aside.

3. Prepare Salad: Rinse and drain lettuce; refrigerate until ready to
assemble salad. Trim green onions to 4 inches in length. Remove roots
and several layers of outer skin to reveal tender pale-green shoots.

4. In 3-quart saucepan, heat 2 inches water to boiling. Cook green
onions in water 1 1/2 minutes. With tongs, remove to colander and set
aside to drain. Add fava beans to same boiling water; cook 1 minute.
Drain and cool fava beans; remove skins.

5. In each of two 1-quart saucepans, heat 1 inch water to boiling.
Add peas to one saucepan and peeled fava beans to the other; cook
both until just tender. Time will vary with maturity of peas and
beans. Drain well.

6. Add salmon to simmering Poaching Liquid. Cook 3 to 5 minutes or
until fish is cooked all the way through but is a bit darker toward
the center. Time will vary depending upon thickness of fish. Remove
to plate to cool; discard Poaching Liquid or refrigerate for another
use.

7. To assemble salad, stir Vinaigrette; add about half to lettuce and
toss. Divide remaining Vinaigrette among green onions, peas, and fava
beans. Break up salmon into large chunks. On 4 chilled plates,
arrange lettuce, salmon, green onions, peas, and fava beans. Garnish
with nas- turtiums or other pesticide-free flowers or tear off
nasturtium petals and sprinkle over salad.
