Title: Simple Onion And Garlic Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
6 lg Onions, thinly sliced
6    Whole cloves garlic, peeled
3 tb Butter
4 c  Beef broth
1 c  Water
1/4 c  Red wine
Black pepper or lemon pepper
Optional: grated mozzarella
Or swiss cheese
In the soup pot, saute the sliced onions in the butter until they
turn a nice brown colour.  Add the beef broth, water, wine, and whole
garlic cloves.  Cover and simmer for about twenty minutes.

Remove the garlic cloves and a few tablespoons of the broth.  The
garlic cloves will be soft.  Put them in a bowl and mash them; add
some broth, and mash them again until they've made a soft puree.  Add
the puree back to the soup, mixing it in well.  Simmer for another
ten minutes.  Add pepper to taste.

Optional: sprinkle some grated cheese into each bowl of hot soup.
