Title: Boston Baked Beans #1
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
4 c  Dry white pea beans
3/4 lb Salt pork
1 lg Peeled onion
2 tb Tomato paste
2 tb Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Dark molasses
2 ts Salt
1 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1 c  Dark brown sugar, firmly
-packed
Powdered cloves
Soak the beans overnight in enough cold water to cover them
generously. Drain, put in a large kettle and cover with fresh water
by 2 inches. Bring to a boil slowly, reduce heat to simmer and cook
gently until the beans are almost tender. If the water boil away, add
more boiling water to keep them well covered. Drain, saving the
cooking water. Meanwhile, scald the pork in boiling water. Cut half
of it into pieces about 1-inch square, leaving the other half whole.

In the bottom of a large earthenware casserole or bean pot with a lid,
place the onion. Add half the drained beans, then the cubes of pork
and top with remaining beans. Put the chunk of pork on top. Mix
together the tomato paste, vinegar, a good pinch of cloves, molasses,
salt, pepper and sugar and pour it over all. Cover and bake in a
preheated 250 degree oven for 6-8 hours. Keep an eye on the beans. If
the liquid boils away, add any remaining bean liquid, heated to the
boiling point, or boiling water. The beans should always be covered
with liquid.

During the last half of cooking, uncover the pot and allow beans to
finish cooking. Do not add any more liquid during this time. Serve
with steamed Boston brown bread (canned) or hot rolls.
