MMMMM-------------------LEMON-LIME POUND CAKE------------------------
8 oz Unsalted butter; at room
-temperature
1 1/2 c  Sugar
5 ea Eggs; at room temperature
1 tb Grated lemon zest
1 tb Grated lime zest
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
(1) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter and flour a 9 x 5 x
3-inch loaf pan.

(2) In a large mixer bowl, cream the butter until smooth, about 1
minute. Gradually add 1-1/2 cups of the sugar and beat until light
and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well
after each addition; beat in the grated lemon and lime zest.

(3) Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder onto a sheet of
waxed paper. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture
in 4 to 5 additions, beating on low speed until just blended after
each addition.

(4) Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the cake for 1 hour
and 15 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes
out clean and the edges of the cake begin to pull away from the sides
of the pan. Leave the cake in the pan and allow it to cool on a rack
for 5 minutes.

****(5)  Meanwhile, in a small nonreactive saucepan, combine the 1/2
cup sugar, the lemon juice and the lime juice. Cook over moderate
heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not
boil. Remove the citrus glaze from the heat.

(6)  Invert the pan to unmold the cake. Set it on a rack over a sheet
of waxed paper. While the cake is still warm, brush all over with the
hot citrus glaze. Let cool completely. Wrap in plastic wrap anf then
overwrap with aluminum foil. Let the cake stand in a cool place for
at least 1 day before slicing. The cake will improve overnight and
will keep, tightly wrapped, for up to 1 week.
