Title: Infused Oils - Cayenne Pepper Oil "China Moon"
Categories: Chilies, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 servings
MMMMM-----------------------YIELD: 3 CUPS----------------------------
3 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
3/4 c  Pepper, Cayenne
Pour oil in a heavy, non aluminum 1 to 2 quart saucepan.  Bring the
oil to 225 degrees on a deep-fry thermometer over moderately low
heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the cayenne pepper, and let
cool to room temperature undisturbed, or overnight if you wish.
Strain the oil slowly and patiently through one or more large paper
coffee filters into an impeccably clean glass jar. Store at room
temperature. A whoppingly spicy-hot oil, this is the perfect
seasoning to use when you are wanting 1,000 watt chile power with
only a few drops of oil. It was suggested by a recipe in one of my
all-time favorite cooking-as-culture books, "Chinese Gastronomy" by
the erstwhile ladies Lin. Be strict about observing the oil
temperature, and do not add the cayenne if the oil is hotter than 250
degrees, or it will burn to a hideous mess. Like any dry spice, the
cayenne should smell "alive" if the results are to be good. The kind
we buy from our spice merchant comes in three grades of ferocity. We
buy the hottest. Why fool around? Source: "China Moon" Barbara Tropp
