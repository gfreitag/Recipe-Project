Title: EGGS AND MUSHROOMS
Categories: Main dish, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
4 lg Eggs
2 tb Butter
1/2 lb Mushrooms (fresh),
-sliced
2 tb Flour
1/2 c  White cooking wine
1/2 c  Chicken broth
3 tb Mayonnaise
1 sm Onion, chopped
1/2 ts Parsley, dried
Salt and pepper
-(to taste)
2 tb Butter, melted
3/4 c  Monterey Jack
-cheese, grated
Saute mushrooms in about 2 tablespoons butter.  Stir in flour.  Blend
well. Add wine, broth, mayonnaise, onion, parsley, salt and pepper.
Cook, stirring until sauce is smooth.

Pour sauce in shallow baking dish.  Break eggs over sauce, taking
care not to break the yolk (it makes serving easier if the eggs are
distributed symmetrically in the dish.) Pour about 2 tablespoons
melted butter over eggs. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F.
until eggs are cooked to your liking. (I like the yolks hard, so I
bake for about 20 minutes.)

NOTES:

*  Eggs poached in mushroom sauce -- I got this recipe off the side
of a bottle of cooking wine (which I had purchased for another
recipe).  It turned out to be so good that I used up the rest of the
bottle in repeat performances.

*  If you use ordinary white wine instead of cooking wine, add about
1/2 teaspoon of salt to it.

*  You can use any mild cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10-20 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
