1. Make the dry rub: In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients.
Rub the tenderloin with the dry rub. Tie the tenderloin crosswise and
lengthwise with kitchen twine. (The roast can be prepared up to 6 hrs
ahead, covered and refrigerated.) 2. Make the BBQ moppin' sauce: In a
medium bowl, combine all the ingredients. (This sauce can be prepared
up to 1 day ahead, covered and refrigerated.) 3. Place a 13 by 9-inch
disposable aluminum foil pan on 1 side of the bottom of a charcoal
grill. Pour 1 inch of water into the pan. Bank charcoal briquets on
the empty side of the grill, and make a hot charcoal fire. 4. Cook
the tenderloin on a lightly oiled grill over the coals, turning and
brushing with the moppin' sauce about every 5 mins, until all sides
are seared, about 15 mins total. (Sear each section of the tenderloin
before brushing with the sauce--moisture inhibts searing.) Move the
tenderloin over the pan and brush well with the sauce. Cover the
grill and cook until a meat thermometer reads 125 F for medium-rare
meat, about 20 more mins. (Check the meat's temperature frequently to
avoid overcooking.) 5. Let the tenderloin stand for 10 mins before
removing the kitchen twine. Carve crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick
slices and serve with the tomato sauce, if desired.
