Title: The Drinking Man's Sos
Categories: Breakfast, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Lean ground beef
3 tb Butter
3 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Dried parsley (heaping tsp)
-salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
-(heaping cup)
1/4 c  Dry vermouth
2/3 c  Sour cream
4    Toasted English muffins
Make white sauce by melting butter, mixing in flour slowly and
stirring while flour cooks for 2-3 minutes.  Add milk slowly,
stirring constantly. Do not allow bottom of pan to burn. When mixture
has thickened, add parsley, salt, pepper, mushrooms, and vermouth .
Stir until blended. Remove from heat and refrigerate until ready to
serve (the sour cream goes in just before serving).

Meanwhile, brown the meat in a saucepan, draining off all fat.
Refrigerate. When ready to serve dinner, combine the meat with the
sauce and add sour cream.  Heat gently until it is hot but not
boiling. If too thick, add a small amount of milk or vermouth.

Serve on toasted English muffins and garnish with fresh parsley. The
parsley should be coarsely chopped because it is more than a garnish.
It adds tang to this recipe.  Muffins add the needed texture
contrast. Try a fried or poached egg on top of each muffin if you
feel adventurous.
