Combine oil, lemon, garlic and oregano; set aside.

Slice eggplant into 1/2-inch rounds.  Cut small squash in half
lengthwise; cut larger squash into 1/2-inch thick pieces.  Cut bell
peppers into large chunks.  Cut onions into wedges or rounds.  Toss
vegetables with garlic oil to coat.

Place in a single layer on grid in covered grill over medium coals.
Grill 10 to 20 minutes or until tender, turning once and basting with
any remaining garlic oil.  Remove vegetables as they become done and
keep warm.

NOTE: If time permits, salt eggplant slices on both sides and spread
out in a single layer on paper towels.  Let stand 30 minutes to
drain, then press with dry towels to remove excess moisture.  This
helps eliminate any bitterness.
