Title: COCONUT MERINGUE DROPS
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday, Usenet
Yield: 5 dozen
3    Egg whites
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Coconut, shredded
Almonds, whole,
-unblanched (optional)
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  In large bowl use an electric mixer
to beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gradually beat in
sugar.  Add vanilla. With a rubber spatula gently fold in coconut.

Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased, floured cookie sheets.
Press an almond in center of each cookie.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for
20 to 25 minutes. Remove to racks to cool.

NOTES:

*  Holiday cookies -- Coconut and almonds give this cookie a
distinctive flavor.  For me the almonds are required.

*  It is a lot of work to beat the egg whites enough without an
electric mixer.

*  This cookie must be handled a little more carefully than most as it
forms a white shell which causes it to be slightly delicate.

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking and cooling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
