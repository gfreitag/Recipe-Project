cold water and mix to a dough.  Lightly knead into a ball, wrap in
plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.  Divide pastry into 6 equal
portions. Roll out each portion thinly and line 6 buttered 12 cm tart
tins with removable bases. Line with greaseproof paper, weight with
dried beans or rice and bake at 180 C for 8 minutes. Remove beans and
paper and bake for 2 minutes longer, or until just beginning to
brown.  For filling, heat oil in a saucepan and cook onion, capsicum,
garlic and thyme on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until onion
is soft.  Add spinach and toss well. Transfer to a bowl and cool.
Whisk eggs with cream and cheese until well combined. Add spinach
mixture and mix well.  Season with salt and freshly ground black
pepper to taste, divide filling among prepared cases, top with olive
halves and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until just set and beginning to
brown. Serve as a light lunch with a crisp green salad.
