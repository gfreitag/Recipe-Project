Prepare basic sauce by mashing garlic with salt in mortar, stirring
in egg yolks, and gradually adding olive oil while stirring in the
same

direction.  Lastly mix in tomatoes, peeled, squeezed to eliminate
seeds, and mashed to a pulp in a separate bowl. This recipe makes 1
3/4 cups of sauce. Comments: Popular in Andalusia, this sauce is
excellent with salads, cold fish, and cold meats. All-i-oli is easy
to make providing certain rules are observed, rules equally
applicable to mayonnaise. The ingredients, particularly the olive
oil, must be at room temperature. The oil must be be added very
gradually and the sauce must be stirred in the same

direction all the while. All-i-oli will keep several days under
refrigeration. Recipe Source: THE SPANISH COOKBOOK by Barbara Norman
