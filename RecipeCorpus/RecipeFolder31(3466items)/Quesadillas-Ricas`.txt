1. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the
onion, cover and remove from heat. Let stand until the onion is
wilted, about 10 mins. Drain well and transfer to a small bowl. Stir
in the chopped chile and bell peppers, mango, and cilantro. Cover and
set aside.

2. Place 1/8 of the cheese on the bottom half of a tortilla. Top with
1/8 of the mango mixture. Fold the top half of the tortilla over to
form a half moon and enclose the filling. Use a toothpick to secure
the tortilla. Continue the procedure with the remaining ingredients.

3. Make a medium-hot fire in the bottom of a charcoal grill.

4. In a small bowl, combine the melted butter and oil. Lightly brush
both sides of the quesadillas with some butter mixture. Grill the
quesadillas for 30 seconds. Rotate them 90 degrees and grill for
another 30 seconds. Turn over and continue grilling until cheese
begins to melt, about 1 min. Transfer to a cutting board, remove
toothpicks and cut each quesadilla into 3 wedges. Serve immediately.
