1 ts Olive oil
1 lg Yellow onion(s)
-finely chopped (1 cup)
3/4 c  Barley
-soaked overnight in
1 qt Water
4 c  (to 5 cups)

3/4 c  Flat-leaf parsley

1. In a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan, melt 3 tbs butter in the
olive oil over moderate heat. Add the onion and cook until very soft,
about 7 minutes.

2. Drain the barley, then rinse and drain again. Add it to the
saucepan with 4 cups of chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and cook
over low heat until the barley is tender, about 50 minutes.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk the yogurt with the egg until smooth. Stir
it into the soup. Cook over low heat for 10 minutes; do not boil. Add
more stock if the soup is too thick.

4. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt the remaining 1 tbs butter over
moderate heat. Add the parsley and mint and cook until wilted, about 1
minute. Stir the herbs into the soup and simmer for 2 minutes to
blend the flavors. Season with salt. Serve warm or cold.

Can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. Reheat carefully over very low
heat to avoid curdling the yogurt. Thin with more chicken stock if
desired.
