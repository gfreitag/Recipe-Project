Title: SNOWBALL COOKIES
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday, Usenet
Yield: 4 dozen
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Butter (or margarine),
-softened
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Walnuts, chopped
Confectioner's sugar
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease cookie sheets lightly with
unsalted shortening.

Sift together flour and salt.  Work butter in a bowl until creamy.
Add sugar and beat until well blended. Add egg and vanilla and beat
well.

Gradually add sifted dry ingredients, beating well after each
addition. Stir in walnuts. Shape dough into small balls about 3/4
inch in diameter.

Place balls about 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets.  Bake
12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.  Roll balls in confectioners
sugar while still warm.  Roll again in sugar when cooled.

Store these in a tight container.  Powered sugar makes this recipe a
little messy.

NOTES:

*  Nut-butter holiday cookie with a sugar coating -- Great for the
holidays when sampling lots of cookies.  Just pop one in your mouth
and enjoy!
