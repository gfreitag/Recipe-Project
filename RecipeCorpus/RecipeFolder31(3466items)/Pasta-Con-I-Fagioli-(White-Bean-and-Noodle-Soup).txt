Title: Pasta Con I Fagioli (White Bean and Noodle Soup)
Categories: Italian, Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 lb Dried white beans
3/4 lb Fresh pork belly with skin
1    Onion; finely chopped
1    Carrot; finely chopped
1    Celery stalk; finely chopped
1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
3    Parsley sprigs; finely ch.
1    Sage sprig; finely chopped
1    Bay leaf
Salt
8 oz Spaghetti or ribbon noodles
2 tb Fruity olive oil
Black pepper; freshly ground
Soak the beans overnight. Drain the beans and put them in a pan with
the pork, the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, parsley, sage and bay
leaf and water to cover. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover
the pan and simmer gently for 2 hours, or until the beans are soft.
Puree 1 cup of beans, then stir the puree back into the soup. Season
to taste with salt and pepper and bring to the boil again. Add the
spaghetti or ribbon noodles and boil for about 12 minutes, or until
they are cooked through, but are still firm to the bite. Remove the
piece of pork belly and cut it into thin strips. Just before serving,
dribble the olive oil into the soup and add with a grinding of black
pepper. Serve the soup warm rather than hot, accompanied by the
strips of pork on a separate plate.

This is a hearty, cold-weather peasant soup from the Veneto and
Friuli, where it is called "pasta e fasioi".
