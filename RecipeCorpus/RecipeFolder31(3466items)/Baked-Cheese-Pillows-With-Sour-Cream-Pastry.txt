BAKED CHEESE PILLOWS WITH SOUR CREAM PASTRY
===========================================
...................................................................

These delicious cheese pillows look like baked blintzes, although
they are made with sour cream dough. I sometimes double this recipe
and freeze half.
...................................................................
DOUGH: 1 c  Maragarine; room temperature 2 1/2 c Flour; sifted 1/2 ts
Baking Powder 2 tb Sugar 1/2 ts Salt 1 c Sour Cream 1/3 c Oil or
melted margarine for brushing FILLING: 1 lb Farmer Cheese (or 1/2 lb.
Farmer Cheese and 1/2 lb. cream cheese) 3-4 tb Sugar 2 ea Eggs 1/2 ts
Cinnamon pn Salt To make dough, cut maragarine imto flour with a
patry bleder, until dough is the consistency of peas. Add remaining
ingredients, mixing only until combined. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
Divide dough into 3 parts. On wax paper, roll eachpart into a
rectangle 1/4 inch thick. Brush with margarine or oil. Combine
ingredients for filling, and place a 1-inch-wide row of filling along
inside edge of dough. Roll and cut at 3 inch intervals to resemble
blintzes. Place on a greased baking sheet, and brush tops with
margarine or oil. Bake in preheated 375F oven for 35 minutes. Yields
about 24 "pillows". From: Classic Kosher Cooking by Sara Finkel
