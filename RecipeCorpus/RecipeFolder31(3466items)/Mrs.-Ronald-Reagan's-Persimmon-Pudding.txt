NOTE: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has found them to be potential carriers of
food-borne illness and recommends that diners avoid eating raw
eggs.Commercial egg substitutes that have been pasturized may be used
in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute
package for applications.
