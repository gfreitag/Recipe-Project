Title: Cepe Consomme
Categories: Sourdough, Soup/stew, Vegetables, French
Yield: 4 servings
3 pt Chicken stock
1/2 oz Dried Cepes
Salt & pepper to taste
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
1 tb Dry Madeira
Put stock - which should be home made and reasonably clear, and not
oversalted, in a saucepan and start heating gently while you wash the
dried cepes (porcini in Italian) in a sieve. Add the cepes to the
stock and when boiling, turn down to a very gentle simmer. Don't
cover, and allow to simmer until reduced to 2/3 volume. Strain and
allow to settle, as the cepes always give out a little sand, no
matter how carefully you wash them. When ready to serve, decant from
the sediment, reheat and season. Add the optional madeira and serve.
