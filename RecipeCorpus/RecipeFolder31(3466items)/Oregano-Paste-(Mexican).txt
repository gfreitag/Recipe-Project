Title: Oregano Paste (Mexican)
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Tex/mexican
Yield: 12 servings
8    Cloves Garlic, Minced
1 tb Mexican Oregano, Crushed
Between Palms
2 ts Salt, Preferably Kosher
1 tb Freshly Ground Black Pepper
Put garlic, oregano, salt and pepper in mortar, blender or food
processor. Process into paste. You can use this paste on chicken or
beef for roasting, or spread it on fish before grilling or baking. I
add a teaspoon or two to plain vinaigrette to add some zing to a
salad. I also put some in olive oil or herb butter. When I want
something hot, I add minced jalapeno and use it to saute shrimp or
boneless chicken pieces. With fresh mint, I use it to flavor a
seafood stew. By Zarela Martinez Copyright Los Angeles Times
