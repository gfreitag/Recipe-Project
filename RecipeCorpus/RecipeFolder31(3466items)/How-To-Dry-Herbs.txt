Categories: Information, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------------NO INGREDIENTS----------------------------
OVEN METHOD-Spread herb stems on a tray in a veory slow oven - no
warmer that 90-100~. (Too hot a temp will destroy the flavorful
oils). Leaves will be dry in 24 to 48 hours. KITCHEN DRYING-Tie
bunches of herbs together (2 or 3 stems) with string; hang upside
down in kitchen or cellar. (Upside down drying allows the oils to
drain into the leaves). Use dried leaves as needed. Or, place the
tied stems in a paper sack, taking care that leaves do not tough
sides of bag. Herbs will dry in 1 to 2 weeks.

Dry herbs till the leaves feel crackly dry. It stems are not as dry,
discard them. Store dried herbs in absolutely dry covered containers
so that mold and milder cannot form. REMEMBER: 1 tb fresh herb = 1 ts
dried herb.

NOTE-You can dry herbs in the microwave. Place herbs on paper towels
and micro until dried, changing towels if they get to damp.
