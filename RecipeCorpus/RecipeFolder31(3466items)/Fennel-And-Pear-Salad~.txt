Title: Fennel And Pear Salad~
Categories: Salads, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Corn, peanut or canola oil
8    Egg roll skins, cut to form
An oval
1/4 c  Pumpkin seeds
1/2 c  Dried tomatoes -- about 1
Ounce
1 sm Fennel bulb -- thinly
Sliced
1 md Bosc pear -- peeled, cored
2 tb Virgin olive oil
1 tb Sherry vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Brush a cookie sheet lightly with
1/2 teaspoon of the oil.  Arrange the egg roll ovals on the sheet and
brush the tops of them with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Bake
at 400 degrees until brown and crisp, about 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer
to a plate and set aside until serving time. Spread the pumpking
seeds on a cookie sheet and toast them lightly in a 400 degree oven
for about 4 or 5 minutes. Set aside.   Bring 2 cups of water to a
boil in a saucepan, drop in the dried tomatoes, and bring back to a
boil. Cover the pan and set it off the heat for 10 minutes.  Drain,
reserving the cooking liquid in the refrigerator or freezer for use
in soups or stews. Cut the tomatoes into 1-inch pieces. Bring 1 quart
water to a boil.  Add the fennel and cook it over high heat for about
3 minutes, or just until the water returns to a boil. Drain and cool
for a few minutes. In a bowl, gently mix together the fennel, pear,
and tomato pieces with the pumpkin seeds and all the vinaigrette
ingredients. To serve, place an egg roll crisp on each of the four
plates. Spoon the fennel mixture on top of the crisps and top each
serving with another egg roll crisp to create a salad "sandwich."
Garnish with the reserved fennel leaves and serve immediately.
