5. Cover with foil.

6. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about 50 minutes.

7. Uncover. Pour remaining sauce over ribs.

8. Bake at 350 degrees F. for another 40 to 50 minutes or until ribs
are no longer pink near the bones. The ribs should be nicely browned
and tender. Check for doneness.

salad.

Tips: Country-style ribs are more meaty than spareribs. Trim off
excess fat before cooking them. No extra salt is needed since the soy
sauce contains salt.
