**  Ed. comment:  There is obviously an error in the way this recipe
was printed.  I think it is likely it actually calls for 36 cherry
tomatoes? Check it out in the actual cookbook to be sure, or use at
your own risk.

Cut tops from tomatoes.  Scoop out pulp and save for soup or other
use. Invert tomatoes on paper towels to drain.  Mix cream cheese and
mayonnaise together until smooth.  Add remaining ingredients.  Fill
tomatoes with mixture.  To serve, place on lettuce-lined tray.
