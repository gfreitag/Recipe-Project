Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the
sugar, flour, sour cream, eggs and vanilla into a smooth mixture.

Core, peel and chop the apples.  Boil them in a small amount of water
with a little lemon juice for 3 to 5 minutes until they begin to get
tender. Drain apples and add to the mixture.

Pour into two 9-inch pastry shells.  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 30
minutes.

While pies are baking, crumble topping ingredients into a bowl and
mix with a pastry cutter or two knives. Remove pies from oven and
cover with topping recipe.  Put pies under broiler for 1 to 2 minutes
until the topping begins to bubble.

Don't take your eyes off the pies while they're under the broiler.  A
moment's inattention can mean burned pie!

NOTES:

*  Apple pie with sour cream goodness -- This recipe came from my
wife's boss, Dick Dolan, the editor of the _Hewlett Packard Journal_.
It is sinfully delicious and never lasts very long, even if you don't
have help eating it!

*  If there is any pie left over, the remainder should be
refrigerated.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
