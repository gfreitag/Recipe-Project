In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbs. oil over medium heat. Add garlic,
thyme, red pepper and 1/4 tsp salt; cook 2 mins. Add shrimp and cood
to skillet; saute with slotted spoon until shrimp and cod are almost
cooked through - about 3 mins. Add calamari to seafood mixture and
cook 1 min (do not overcook as calamari will toughen). Remove seafood
to large bowl or plate; cover to keep warm and set aside. Add
remaining 3 Tbs oil to skillet. Stir in tomatoes with liquid, wine,
sugar and remaining 1/4 tsp salt to skillet to make sauce; cover and
simmer 10 mins. Meanwhile, cook tagliatelle following package
directions. Uncover sauce and cook 5 mins longer. Remove from heat
and gently stir in reserved seafood. If desired, just before serving,
steam mussels until they open. Discard any that don't open. To serve,
transfer cooked pasta to serving platter, top with sauce and seafood
mixture, and toss until well combined. Garnish platter with mussels
and fresh thyme sprig.
