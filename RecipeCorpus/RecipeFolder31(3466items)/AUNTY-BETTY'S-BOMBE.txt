Title: AUNTY BETTY'S BOMBE
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Double cream
1/3 c  Sugar
4 tb Water
6 oz Chocolate, plain
3    Egg yolks
Whisk 1/2 of the cream until stiff and spread it around the edges of a
large bowl. Freeze for 1/2 to 1 hour.

Dissolve the sugar in the water, bring to the boil and simmer for 3
minutes until syrupy.  Meanwhile, break chocolate into blender or
warm bowl.

Pour the hot sugar syrup onto the chocolate and blend or whisk until
the chocolate has all melted.  Add the egg yolks and mix the whole lot
thoroughly.

Whisk the remaining cream into soft peaks and fold gently into the
chocolate mixture. Pour into the centre of the frozen cream and
freeze for several hours until solid. Cover when fully frozen.

NOTES:

*  A high-cholesterol chocolate dessert -- This recipe comes from a
friend's aunt. It always seems to taste wonderful no matter how
sloppily I measure things. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  Although the recipe "serves 4-6," two people will happily eat the
whole thing.

*  The outside is frozen solid, so you may find a fork useful for
breaking your portion into pieces without showering fellow diners
with fragments. It could be served in small portions, but don't count
on having any left over.

*  Double cream has more than 45 percent butterfat.  It is difficult
to find cream in North America that is richer than whipping cream,
which is typically 32 percent butterfat. If you can find heavy cream
it is likely to be 36 percent. Use the richest cream you can find.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooling.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
