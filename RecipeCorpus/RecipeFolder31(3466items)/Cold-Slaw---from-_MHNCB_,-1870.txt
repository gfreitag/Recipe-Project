#366. Cold Slaw.- Cut a head of hard white cabbage into very fine
shavings. It is seldom shaved fine enough. For a quart of the cabbage
take the yolks of three eggs, beat them well; stir into a tumbler and
a half of vinegar two teaspoonfuls of loaf sugar, a tablespoonful of
olive oil, one of thick, sweet cream, or a piece of butter as large
as a walnut, a heaped teaspoonful of mustard, salt and pepper to
taste; mix with the egg, and put this sauce into a stew-pan; when hot
add the cabbage; stew until thoroughly hot, which will only require
four or five minutes. Toss it up from the bottom with a silver or
wooden fork. Take it up and set where it will become perfectly cold,
on ice is best. The quantity of the vinegar will depend on its
strength.
