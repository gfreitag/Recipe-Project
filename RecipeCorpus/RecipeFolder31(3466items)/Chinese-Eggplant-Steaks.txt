Title: Chinese Eggplant Steaks
Categories: Nuts/grains, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Eggplant
Salt
1 tb Butter
2    Garlic cloves; fine chopped
2 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Rice wine vinegar
2 ts Oriental sesame oil
1/2 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Pepper
1 tb Toasted pine nuts
1    Green onion; finely chopped
At least one hour before serving, prepare eggplant: Trim and discard
ends of eggplant.  Cut crosswise diagonally into eight 1/2" thick
slices. Sprinkle both sides of slices lightly with salt; place in
colander and set aside 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare marinade.  In small skillet, melt butter over
medium heat.  Add garlic and saute until golden.  Add soy sauce,
vinegar, sesame oil, sugar and pepper.  Cook 1 minute.  Remove from
heat and spread in large shallow baking pan or jelly-roll pan.

Rinse eggplant slices and pat dry.  Place slices in pan with marinade,
turning to season both sides; set aside at least 20 minutes or up to 2
hours.

Heat broiler.  Drain marinade from pan; reserve.  Broil eggplant
slices 3" from heat source until lightly browned; turn to brown other
side. Transfer to serving plate and top with pine nuts and green
onions. Reheat marinade, pour over eggplant and serve.

Van Dyne writes: "Do-ahead cooks will enjoy this dish.  Although it
requires time to prepare and marinate the eggplant, the cooking takes
only minutes."
