NOTE: This is a version (Updated slightly) of a very old recipe.  It
was used by many a farmer's wife and frontier wife to use up sour
milk and cream for a dessert.  The vinegar is used to preserve the
pie where there was no refrigeration.  It is basically a spice
custard pie. Prepare the pastry and line a 9-inch pie pan.  Chill
while making the filling. Sift the flour, spices, and salt together
and set aside Beat the egg yellows thoroughly.  Wash and dry the
beater, then beat the 2 egg whites until they stand in peaks.  Gently
fold the sugar into the egg whites and stir into the yellows.  Add
the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream. Combine the
butter, vinegar, nuts, and raisins and stir into the filling. Pour
into the pie shell and bake in a preheated 450 degree F. Oven for 10
minutes.  Reduce the heat to 400 degrees F. and bake 5 minutes. Then
turn the heat down to 350 degrees F. and continue baking for about 15
minutes or until the filling is set.  Cool.  May be served with
whipped cream, if desired. From The Complete Book Of Pickles &
