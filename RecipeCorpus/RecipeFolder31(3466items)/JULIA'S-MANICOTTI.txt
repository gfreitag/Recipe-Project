MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
1 lb Ricotta
2    Eggs
1 c  Mozzarella, shredded
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
1/2 ts Black pepper
1    Garlic clove, crushed
MAKE SAUCE:  Saute onions in large pot with olive oil over medium
heat. Add crushed garlic.  Cook until onions start to brown.  Add
cans of tomatoes along with paste, breaking any large chunks. Add in
seasonings and red wine. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20-30
minutes.

MAKE FILLING:  mix filling ingredients in bowl, reserving about 1/2
cup of the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on top.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cook manicotti until they are al dente
(follow the instructions on the box). Drain and stuff each with
filling mixture. Cover baking pan with about 1/2 inch of sauce, and
arrange stuffed shells on top. Cover with sauce and reserved
mozzarella. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about 20 minutes, until cheese
is nicely browned and sauce is bubbling.

NOTES:

*  This is my (American) recipe for stuffed manicotti shells.
Perhaps it's not authentic, but it's tasty.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  While I prefer to use true manicotti, regular pasta shells are
easier to stuff and it's okay to substitute.  You can also cut each
manicotti down one side and rewrap it around the stuffing. This
freezes well uncooked; cover with plastic wrap and foil. Let it
defrost in a 200 95 oven for an hour or overnight in the
refrigerator. The cheese mixture can be modified to suit your tastes.
Cottage cheese can be substituted for the ricotta.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 20 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
