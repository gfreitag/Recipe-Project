Title: Cornmeal Crepes with Berries
Categories: Breakfast, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
3 c  Sliced strawberries
1 c  Milk
2/3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Apricot jam
* - or regular sour cream
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
2 tb Sugar
3 lg Eggs
1/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
2 1/2 ts Butter or margarine
Vanilla low-fat yogurt*
Mix strawberries and sugar; set aside. In a blender, whirl milk, eggs,
flour, cornmeal, and vanilla until there are no lumps. Place a
flat-bottom 7-8"-wide frying or crepe pan over medium-high heat. When
pan is hot, add 1/4 teaspoon butter and swirl to coat surface. Pour
in 1/4 cup batter all at once; quickly tilt pan so batter flows over
entire surface (don't worry if there are a few holes). Cook until
surface is dry and edge is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Turn with
a spatula and brown other side. Turn out onto a plate; keep warm.
Repeat to cook remainder, stirring batter thoroughly before cooking
each crepe (cornmeal sinks), and stacking crepes as made. Spread 1
side of each crepe lightly with jam; fold in quarters. Offer crepes
with berries and yogurt to add to taste. From the files of Earl
