Title: Orange Roughy With Tomato-Orange Salsa~
Categories: Fish, Seafood, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1    Orange
1 md Tomato -- core, dice
1    Jalapeno pepper -- seed,
Mince
2 tb Fresh cilantro -- chopped
1 tb Lime juice
1    Clove garlic -- minced or
Pressed
1/2 ts Fresh ginger root -- grated
Salt and pepper
1 1/3 lb Orange roughy fillets
Seafood alternatives:  Tilapia, Red Snapper, Halibut.

Preheat the oven to 400F.  Slice 1/2" from both ends of the orange.
Stand the orange on one end and cut away the peel and white pith with
a small sharp knife; discard.  Working over a bowl to catch the
juice, slice alongside the membranes to the center of the orange and
remove the segments. Squeeze the remaining membranes to release the
juice; set aside. Dice the segments and put them in a medium bowl
with the tomato, jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, garlic and ginger.
Stir to mix and season with salt and pepper.

Rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Lay the
fillets on a lightly oiled baking sheet and spoon the orange juice
over them; sprinkle with pepper if desired.  Bake for 5 minutes.
Spoon the salsa over the fish and continue baking until the fish is
opaque through the center, 3-6 minutes longer, depending on the
thickness of the fillets.
