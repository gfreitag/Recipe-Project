2    Loaves bread
Salt and pepper
Sage
1/2 lb Butter, melted
4 lg Apples

Wash and dry turkey, inside and out. Peel and pare apples, chop into
small pieces (I think they meant to say peel and core). Mix al
stuffing ingredients gently. Stuff turkey with alight hand, stitch
opening closed, and bake immediately for several ours at about
270-300 degrees. Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
