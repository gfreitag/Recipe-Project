Title: Spinach Pizza
Categories: Breads, Main dish
Yield: 2 pies
CRUST:
4 1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Water, lukewarm (105 to 115
Degrees Fahrenheit)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Olive oil
Topping:
1 bn Spinach, rinsed, stemmed
3 c  Mushrooms, sliced
2 tb Fresh garlic, minced
1 ts Dried basil, or 1/4 cup
Fresh minced
1 tb Olive oil
1 c  Mozzarella, grated
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.

Spread the olive oil and tomato sauce on the pizza pie, top with
shredded mozzarella. Steam the spinach leaves for a few minutes. Toss
spinach with mushrooms, garlic, basil, and olive oil. Spread veggies
on pizza crust. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until edges are brown and
cheese is bubbly. Cut each pie into 6 wedges.
