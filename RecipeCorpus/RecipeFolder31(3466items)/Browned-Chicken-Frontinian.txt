Translation of the original:

PULLUM FRONTONIANUM Roast the chicken a little to brown it, and then
season it with stock, olive oil, a bouquet of aniseed, chives,
savory, and green coriander. When the bird is done, remove it [from
the pan] and arrange it on a platter that you have soaked with boiled
wine. Sprinkle with pepper, and serve.
