a wok over high heat.  Stir-fry beef strips (half at a time) and
garlic 1 to 2 minutes.  Do not overcook; beef will still be pink;
remove from wok, season with salt and pepper and keep warm.  Add
remaining oil to wok. Stir-fry broccoli florets and red pepper over
high heat for 6 to 7 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Combine water,
cornstarch, and Italian seasoning; stir into vegetable mixture.  Cook

Return beef to the wok; cook until heated through. Serve over hot
cooked linguini.
