Title: AMBROSIA
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Cream, heavy
2    Bananas (or equivalent
-amount of soft fruit)
Broken meringue
Whip the cream.  Chop fruit coarsely, but don't crush.  Break
meringue into large crumbs.  Mix everything shortly before serving
and pile into glasses.

NOTES:

*  Simple dessert for failed Pavlova attempts -- My mother used to
make the banana variety of this when she cooked her meringues a
little too long or too hot. I've no idea of its origins.

*  I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the
banana version. Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never
tried it.

*  This is a neat way of saving a Pavlova attempt when the meringue
part fails:  it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever
know...

: Difficulty:  very simple.
: Time:  10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
