A marsala wine sauce is very easy. After you have sauteed your
meat--beef, chicken, etc--deglaze the pan with Marsala wine, add
chicken broth and reduce by half. Add sliced mushrooms if desired and
simmer for 2 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper, and that's all there is
to it! Source: Tony Cortese, Amerigo's Restaurant, NYC.
