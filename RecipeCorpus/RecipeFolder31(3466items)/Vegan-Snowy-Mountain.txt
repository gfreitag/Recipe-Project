Categories: Desserts, Vegetables, Fruit, Cake/cookie
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ea Chocolate cake, see recipe
2 tb Malibu*
2 ea Oranges, peeled & diced
1/2 c  Tofu
3 tb Rum**
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Lemon juice
1/2 c  Coconut, shredded
For this recipe, you need 1/2 of the chocolate cake recipe, so freeze
half or set aside for future use.

Roughly cut up the chocolate cake into good bite-sized pieces & place
in a medium sized serving dish.  Soak with the malibu.  Arrange the
chopped oranges over the cake.  Set aside.

In a food processor or blender, blend the tofu until smooth.  Add the
remaining ingredients & blend until well mixed.  Spread over the top
of the cake & oranges.  Chill until ready to serve.

* I liked the coconut-pineapple taste that the malibu provided, you
could use orange juice in place if you desire.

** Use some rum extract instead of rum & reduce the amount.  Or use a
fruit juice that might combine well with coconut but that is clear,
otherwise the topping will look a funny colour.

VARIATIONS: Use canned fruits, fruit salads or other fresh fruits of
your choice.  I find that naturally juicy fruits work the best.

Use a plain sponge cake instead of the chocolate cake.

Garnish with strawberries or kiwis before serving.
