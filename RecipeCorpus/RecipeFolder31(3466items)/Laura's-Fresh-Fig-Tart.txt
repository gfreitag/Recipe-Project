LAURA'S FRESH FIG TART
======================
Although fresh fig's are available now, they really come into season
later in the summer -- the ideal time to make this delicious dessert
from Laura Prentice.

12-18 lg Fresh Figs; quartered 1/4 c Metaxa Brandy 3 tb Granulated
Sugar

PASTRY:

1 1/2 c All-Purpose Flour 2/3 c Cold Butter; cut into cubes 2 tb
Granulated Sugar 3 tb Cold Water

FILLING:

3/4 c  Plain Yogurt 2 tb Pistachio Nuts; chopped 2 tb Liquid Honey 1
ea Egg Yolk 1 ts Ground Cinnamon

GREEK HONEY:

1/2 c  Water 1/2 c Granulated Sugar 3 in Cinnamon Stick 2 ea Whole
Cloves

In bowl, gently toss together figs, brandy and sugar. Set aside.

TO MAKE PASTRY, process flour, butter and sugar in food processor
until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add water, processing with
on/off motion until ball forms. (You can add 1 tablespoon more water
if required to form soft but not sticky dough).

Roll out pastry on lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch thick. Place in
10-inch flan pan, trimming edges. Line with parchment paper or foil,
fill with pie weights (dry beans work well) and bake inpreheated 325F
oven 25 minutes. Remove weights and and lining. Bake 10 minutes or
until pastry is very light brown at edges and dry on bottom.

FOR FILLING, combine yogurt, pistachios, honey, egg yolk and
cinnamon. Pour into shell. Place figs on filling attractively. Bake
20 minutes or until figs are tender. Cool.

In small saucepan, combine Greek honey ingredients. Bring to boil,
reduce heat to medium and boil about 10 minutes or until slightly
thickened and reduced by a third. When serving, drizzle a little
honey over each slice of tart.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
