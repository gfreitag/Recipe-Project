There is one great cheesecake recipe against which all others are
judged. None have ever come close. This is not a cream cheese pie,
this is a cake, lofty, light, delicate, with a melt-in-your-mouth
cheese texture. It simply is unlike any other cheesecake. It is also
world famous. It is the cheesecake as made at New York City's Lindy's
Restaurant - something people came from all over the world to
experience.

Make the crust first: Combine the flour, sugar, lemon peel and
vanilla in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center. Add the egg yolk
and butter. Use your finger tips to mix until a dough forms and
cleans the sides of the bowl. Form the dough into a ball. Wrap in wax
paper. Refrigerate for 1 hour or more.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease the sides and bottom of a 9"
springform pan. Remove the side from the pan. Roll 1/3 of the dough
on the bottom of the springform pan. Trim the edge of the dough to
fit the pan. Bake until golden (8-10 minutes). Divide the rest of the
dough into 3 parts. Roll each part into a strip 2 1/2" wide and about
10" long. Put the springform pan together with the baked crust on the
bottom. Fit the 3 dough strips to the side of the pan, joining the
ends inside to completely line the inside of the pan. Trim the dough
so that it only comes 3/4 of the way up the side of the pan.
Refrigerate the dough lined pan until you are ready to fill it.
Increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees.

Prepare the filling: Use the large bowl of an electric mixer to
combine the cream cheese, sugar, flour, lemon and orange peels and
vanilla extract. Beat at high speed just until blended. Beat the eggs
and egg yolks in one at a time. Add the cream. Beat until just well
combined. Pour the mixture into the springform pan. Bake 10 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees. Bake 1 hour longer. Cool
in the pan on a wire rack. Refrigerate at least 3 hours. Loosen the
pastry from the side of the pan with a spatula. Remove the side of
the springform pan. Cut into wedges. Serve.
