Saute onions in hot fat in the bottom of a dutch oven or any other
heavy iron pot with a tight fitting lid.  When onions are brown, add
the beans, potatoes and place meat in the center.  Mix flour and
seasonings and sprinkle over the top.  Add boiling water to cover.
Close lid and cook over low heat for 3 to 4 hours.  Lift cover to
make sure no additional water is needed, cover and place in a 375
oven for 1/2 hour. Lower heat to 225 degrees and allow to stay all
day or over night. Keep covered tightly, no basting and no peeking.
The pot may be given an additional shake or two before being placed
in the oven. The tcholent can also be cooked on the top of the stove.
After the first 3 to 4 hour, place the pot on the blech over a dimmer
flame. The flame should be as low as possible without the danger of
extinguishing during the night. Let the pot sit on the stove until
ready to serve.
