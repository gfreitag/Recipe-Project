Title: Curried Couscous with Pine Nuts and Currants
Categories: Side dish, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 c  Uncooked couscous
1 tb Olive oil
1 c  Hot water
1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)
1/2 c  Minced onion
3 1/2 tb Curry powder
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Salt
6 ds Tabasco sauce
1/2 c  Toasted pine nuts
1/2 c  Currants
Place the couscous in a bowl. Add the olive oil and rub the couscous
with your hands to thoroughly coat each grain. Add the hot water and
stir well until the water is absorbed.

In a 10-inch saut pan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the
onion and cook gently until it is soft, about 10 minutes.

Add the curry powder and cook another 2 minutes, stirring. Do not
brown the curry powder or it will become bitter.

Add the couscous, lemon juice, salt, Tabasco, pine nuts, and
currants. Stir well to distribute the seasonings. Cook until couscous
is hot and serve.

Note: This can be made up to a week in advance and reheated, covered,
in a 350F oven for about 15 minutes.
