MMMMM---------------------RED-COOKING LIQUID--------------------------
1 ts Sichuan peppercorns
4 c  Water
1/2 c  Black soy sauce
2 tb Chinjiang vinegar
2    Scallions

Red-Cooking Meat:  In medium hot wok, toast peppercorns until fragrant
(avoid burning); crush & finely mince with cleaver; reserve.  Cut
beef into 1 1/2" chunks.  Heat cooking oil in hot wok until it starts
to smoke; brown beef in several batches; drain oil & discard.
Combine peppercorns & remaining ingredients of red-cooking liquid;
add to wok. Bring to boil; reduce heat & simmer, covered, for 1 1/2
to 2 hours, until meat is very tender.  (If liquid evaporates before
meat is tender, add cup of water or stock and continue cooking.)
Remove meat from liquid.  If desired, cool meat, cover and
refrigerate.

Boiling Noodles:  Bring 4 qts. water to rolling boil; add noodles.
Drain when still slightly undercooked.

Stir-frying:  Heat peanut oil in hot wok.  When oil starts to smoke,
add scallions & stir-fry until fragrant.  Add garlic, ginger & Napa
cabbage; stir-fry for about 1 minute, until cabbage is slightly
wilted.  Add meat & all gravy ingredients except cornstarch paste.
Reduce heat to medium, cover, & simmer for about 3 minutes.  Remove
cover; dribble in enough cornstarch paste to make a light gravy; not
too heavy as you want to coat noodles, but not too soupy either.
Turn up heat; when sauce returns to boil, add noodles.  Toss to mix
(& reheat) noodles.  Transfer to warmed serving platter or large bowl.
