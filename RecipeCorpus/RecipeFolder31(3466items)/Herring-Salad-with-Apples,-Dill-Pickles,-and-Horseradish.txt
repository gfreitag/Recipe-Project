8 lg Matjes herring fillets (1lb)
1 c  Buttermilk
1 c  Sour cream (or light sc)
1/3 c  Plain non-fat yogurt
1 md Onion, finely chopped
2 md Tart apples, peeled, cored,
.coarsely chopped
2 md Dill pickles, minced
1 tb Prepared horseradish
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Sugar
Salt, pepper to taste
1. Lay the herring fillets in a shallow baking dish. Add the
buttermilk, cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.

2. On the next day, drain and rinse the herring fillets well, then
cut into bite-size pieces. Place the herring in a shallow glass or
porcelain baking dish.

3. Combine the sour cream, yogurt, onion, apples, pickles,
horseradish, lemon juice and sugar. Tast for lemon juice and sugar
and add a bit more of each, if needed. There should be a light lemon
flavor and just enough sugar to mellow the tartness. Season the sauce
to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon over the herring, cover and
marinate several hours in the refrigerator before serving.
