Title: Ants Crawling Up Trees
Categories: Chinese, Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
2/3 c  TVP
1/2 c  Hot water
1 tb Chopped or grated ginger
Root
2 tb Soy sauce
1    To 2 Tbsp hot bean paste
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
3 1/2 oz Bean thread noodles
2 c  Veggie broth or water (avoid
Broth that may have a sweet
Taste)
Pour the boiling water over the TVP and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Saute the gingerroot in a very small anount of oil or other liquid.
Add the soy sauce, bean paste, salt and TVP. Cook very very gently
and stir frequently as it burns easily. Cook about 5 minutes and set
aside.

Cook the bean threads in the broth until the broth has been absorbed
by the noodles. Add the noodles to the TVP mixture and stir until
blended evenly...ie. all the "ants" are distributed throughout. Enjoy!

Source: This is a dish that was a favorite at our local Chineses
eatery. I used to make it with ground turkey (before I saw the light)
and have found that TVP works just as well. It's hot and
spicy...delicious and just a little different.
