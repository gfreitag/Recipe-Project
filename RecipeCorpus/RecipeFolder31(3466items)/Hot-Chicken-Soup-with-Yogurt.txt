Title: Hot Chicken Soup with Yogurt
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 tb Rice
1 qt Chicken Stock
2/3 c  Plain Yogurt
1    Egg
Salt
Ground Pepper
1 tb Parsley, chopped
1 tb Fresh Mint, chopped
Simmer the rice in the chicken stock until tender, about 12 minutes.
Beat the yogurt with the egg in a bowl, stir in a little hot stock,
then gradually add the contents of the bowl to the rest of the
