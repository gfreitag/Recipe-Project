Marinate 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts in 1/2 cup Kraft
peppercorn ranch dressing for about 1/2 hour.  Drain and use this
dressing as a basting sauce while grilling chicken.  When done, slice
diagonally. Toss together spinach leaves, 1 cup halved cherry
tomatoes and one sliced red onion.  Arrange onto plates and 'fan'
with sliced chicken. Drizzle fresh dressing over top, or serve with
dressing on side.
