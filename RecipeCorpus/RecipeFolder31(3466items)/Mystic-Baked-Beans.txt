Title: Mystic Baked Beans
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1 lb Navy beans, dried
2 c  Water
2 ts Dry mustard
Pepper to taste
3 ea Onions, peeled & quartered
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Molasses
2 tb Sweet pickle juice
1/3 lb Salt pork, cubed
Soak beans overnight in water to cover. Pour beans into large pot,
and add remaining ingredients except salt pork. Bring to a boil,
lower heat, and simmer 1 to 2 hours till beans are tender. Place salt
pork in a bean pot or a crockpot.  Pour beans and liquid over. If
using a bean pot, cook in the oven at 250 for ten hours.  If using a
crockpot, cook on LOW for 8 to 12 hours. Beans should be dark and
sticky, but still somewhat liquid, when done. Great Northern beans
may be used instead of navy or pea beans. Keep some additional brown
sugar/molasses/water on hand if needed to keep beans wet while
cooking. Recipe may be doubled, but use a little less liquid.

SMOKE 'N' BEANS For a lower fat (and in my case, kosher) alternative,
use about 1/2 pound of smoked turkey (the real stuff, not the deli
variety) cubed in small bits instead of the salt pork. You will need
to add a little salt, about 1 teaspoon.  The flavor is excellent,
without all the fat and pork...
