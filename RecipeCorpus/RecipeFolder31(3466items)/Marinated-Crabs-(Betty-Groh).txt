Title: Marinated Crabs (Betty Groh)
Categories: Seafood, Main dish, Cajun/creol
Yield: 6 servings
6    Crabs, cooked
1 1/2    Lemons
1/2    + cup olive oil
5    To 6 cloves garlic, minced
3    Stalks celery, chopped
Parsley, chopped

(To cook crabs, place in boiling water with salt, crab boil and
lemons for 20 minutes.)

Clean crabs, removing legs. (This means: remove tops from crabs and
tear off the dead man's fingers -- the spongy material on top of the
shell on both ends).  Break crabs in half if small, quarters if
large.  Slice lemons and squeeze.  Combine lemon juice, olive oil,
garlic, celery, and parsley and pour over crabs.  Turn occasionally
while marinating.
