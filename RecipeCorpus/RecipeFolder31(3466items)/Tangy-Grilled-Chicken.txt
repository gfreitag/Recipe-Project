Title: Tangy Grilled Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
2    Chickens,about 3 lbs.
-each,cut into pieces
1 ts Salt
1 tb Hungarian sweet paprika
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/3 c  Water
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/3 c  Red wine vinegar
1/4 c  Butter,cut into bits
Vegetable oil
Place the chicken pieces in a large shallow glass or ceramic dish.

In a medium saucepan, combine the dry ingredients with the water.
Heat to boiling; remove from heat. Add the Worcestershire sauce and
vinegar. Stir in the butter. Pour over the chicken. Let stand 1 hour.

Preheat the grill. If using presoaked wood chips or chunks (chips are
for gas grills), or other flavorings, sprinkle over the hot coals or
lava rocks. Brush the grid lightly with oil.

Place the dark meat of the chicken on the grid and cover-cook with the
vents open over hot or high heat for 15 minutes, basting often with
the extra sauce and turning once. Add the white meat to the grid and
continue to cover-cook 15 to 20 minutes longer until both meats are
crisp and the juices run yellow when pricked with a fork. Baste often
and turn once. (Remove cover and continue to grill if chicken is not
crisp enough.)

Serve 6 to 8.
