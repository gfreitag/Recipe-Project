orange juice or milk, and vanilla til combined.  Beat in as much of
the flour as you can with the mixer.  Stir in any remaining flour
with a wooden spoon.  Turn dough onto waxed paper and knead in enough
red food coloring for desired color.  Cover and chill dough for 3
hours, or until easy to handle.

Stir together egg white and water.  Roll half the dough at a time on a
floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut with a 3 inch round cookie
cutter.  Cut cookies in half.  For each cookie, using a small brush,
brush egg white mixture on rounded edge and 1/4 inch wide strip on
front of cookie along the rounded edge.  Dip edge in green sugar.
Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Press a few chocolate pieces
into each for "seeds".

Bake in a 375 oven for 5-7 mins, or til beginning to brown on bottom.
Do NOT allow to brown on top.  Remove cookies and cool completely on
wire rack.
