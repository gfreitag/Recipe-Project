Title: Dan's Simple Jerky
Categories: Meats, Can/preserv
Yield: 12 servings
1/4 c  Salt
3/4 c  Sugar
1 qt Water
Cut meat into strips 1/4" to 3/8" thick, cut crosswise with the grain.

Mix ingredients in a NON-ALUMINUM bowl.  Immerse jerky meat in brine,
making sure that it is completely covered.  Let brine overnight, or 8
to 12 hours.

After brining is complete, remove jerky meat, and rinse thourghly in
cold water.  Allow to air dry.  you should note a glaze forming when
drying is complete (you can put the meat on the smoking racks to dry).

Load into smoker.  Use two or three pans of wood chips early in the
smoking process.  Smoke until jerky will crack, but not break when it
is bent. Submitted By LAWRENCE KELLIE   On   06-17-95
