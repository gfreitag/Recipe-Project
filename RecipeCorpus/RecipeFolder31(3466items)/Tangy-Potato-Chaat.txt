Title: Tangy Potato Chaat
Categories: Side dish, Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Cilantro, coarsely chopped
1 tb Jalapeo pepper
-cored, seeded, chopped
8    (to 10) mint leaves
1 tb Ginger, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 lb Waxy potatoes
-Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold
-peeled, cut in 1 1/2" cubes
1/4 c  Lime juice
1/2 ts Chaat powder
1/2 ts Salt
Put the cilantro, jalapeo, mint and ginger in a food processor and
process until finely chopped. Set aside.

Steam or boil the potatoes until they can be pierced easily with a
fork, 15-20 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix the lime juice, chaat powder and salt in a large bowl.
Add the cooked, drained potatoes and toss gently to coat; they will
absorb the juice quickly. Add the herb paste and toss again. Taste
and adjust seasonings. Serve immediately or chill for 45 minutes and
serve cold.
