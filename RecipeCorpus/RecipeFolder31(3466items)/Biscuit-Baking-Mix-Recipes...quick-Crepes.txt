Making crepes can be easy if you already have a batch of
:
baking mix in the pantry.  Flipping and filling takes some practice,
but you'll get it down.  Make sure your pan is hot enough to bounce a
drop of water, and has no rough spots.
Crepes can be filled with various meat stuffings for a quick
:
brunch or dinner, or they are great with fruit for dessert.  You can
make a batch of them and freeze them with wax paper or plastic wrap
between each one.

QUICK CREPES: Combine ingredients and beat until smooth in a blender,
food processor or shaker container. Mixture will be thin.

~To Use
For each crepe, pour about 1/4 cup of batter into a hot,
:
greased pan.  Turn pan until batter covers the bottom and cook over
medium heat until golden brown.  Loosen edge with a spatula, trn over
and cook the other side unit golden brown.
To reheat frozen crepes: either thaw, still wrapped, at room
:
temp for 1 hour before warming in an oven set at 350, or wrap and
place in a microwave on medium for 1 or 2 minutes.

~Ideas
For dinner or brunch crepes, try filling with a spoonful of
:
finely ground tuna, chicken, or turkey salad and top with white sauce.
For dessert, fill with spiced apples, sweetened cherries or
:
berries; top with sweetened whipped cream and dust with cinnamon.

BLINTZES:

Mix batter and cook, as for crepes.  Fill the crepe while still warm
with sweetened cream cheese, top with sour cream, and dust with more
sugar.
