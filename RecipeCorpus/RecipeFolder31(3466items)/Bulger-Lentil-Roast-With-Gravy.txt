LOAF:  Pick over lentils & remove any sticks & stones that there
might be in them.  Wash & drain.  Place in a large pot & add water.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat & simmer for 40 mintues to 1 hour.  The
lentils need to be good & soft.  Once they are soft, add the bulgur,
remove from the heat. Stir every once in a while, until the water has
been absorbed. Set aside.

Using a blender or food processor, grind the oatmeal until it is very
fine, of a flour-like consistency.  Transfer to a mixing bowl.  Add
the lentil-bulgur mixture & the remaining ingredients.  Mix very
well. Turn into a lightly oiled loaf pan.  Press down firmly.  Cover
with aluminum foil.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  When the oven is hot, bake the loaf for 55
minutes.  Remove the foil & return to the oven for another 5 minutes
to brown.  Remove from the oven & let sit, loosely covered, for 10 to
15 minutes.  Turn onto a serving plate & serve in slices.

GRAVY:  Heat oil.  When hot, stir in the flour & let cook gently for
30 seconds.  Add a dash of Worcestershire Sauce, followed by whatever
vegetable stock you have on hand.  Add the herbs & bring to a boil.
The amount of stock depends on how thick you want the gravy.  When it
boils, reduce heat & let it simmer on very low heat for 5 minutes or
so, to thicken.

VARIATION:  Add about 1/4 c sliced mushrooms to the gravy when you
add the stock.

TO SERVE:  This goes very well with Greek style roasted potatoes, a
green vegetable, such as asparagus or beans, & a vegan "Yorkshire"
pudding. Ask for the reciupe if you want it.  It keeps well in the
fridge (I've not tried freezing it) & is good served cold with a good
vegetable soup, a baked potato, picalilli & green tomato chutney.
