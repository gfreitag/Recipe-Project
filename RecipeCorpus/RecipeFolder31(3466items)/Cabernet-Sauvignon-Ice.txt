3/4 c  Lemon juice
1 1/2 c  Cabernet Sauvignon

In a 1 to 1 1/2 quart pan, combine sugar, water and wine.  Bring to

cool. Add grape juice and lemon juice.  Cover and chill until cold,
at least one hour. Pour mixture into 2 or 3 divided ice cube trays or
a shallow 9 inch square metal pan.  Freeze until solid, about 4
hours. Place ice, 1/3 to 1/2 at a time, in a food processor.  Whirl
with on/off bursts at first, then steadily until ice is a velvety
slush. Spoon into a container, cover, and freeze until solid.
Garnish servings with mint and grapes. Makes about 5 cups.
