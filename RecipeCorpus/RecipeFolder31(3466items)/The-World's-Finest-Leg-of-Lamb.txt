Title: The World's Finest Leg of Lamb
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1    4 1/2 lb leg of lamb
3    Cloves
Garlic
Olive oil
Black pepper, ground
6    Fresh rosemary sprigs
Trim the excess fat on the meat, but leave a thin layer. Make 1"
slits all over the meat, and insert a slice of garlic into each slit.
Rub well with a liberal coating of olive oil, and then coat heavily
with salt and pepper. Wrap securely with plastic wrap, and
refrigerate for at least several hours - the longer, the better!

Preheat the oven to 500F. Heat an oven-proof skillet large enough to
hold the lamb comfortably. Remove the lamb to a platter, and pour off
all but 1 T. olive oil. Cover the bottom of the pan with the
rosemary. Place the lamb on top, and cover the lamb with more
rosemary. Place in the oven, and reduce oven temperature to 375F
after 20 minutes. Roast 40 minutes longer. To serve: take the lamb,
in its pan, outside. Ignite the rosemary on the top of the lamb.
Allow the fire to burn itself out. Brush off the woody stems. Let
rest 10-15 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and enjoy!
