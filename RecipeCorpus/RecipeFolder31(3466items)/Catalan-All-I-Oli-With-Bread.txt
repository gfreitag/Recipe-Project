Title: Catalan All-I-Oli With Bread
Categories: Spanish, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
6    Garlic cloves -- peeled
1/2 sl White bread -- crust
Removed
1/2 ts Lemon juice or wine vinegar
1 c  Olive oil -- room
Temperature
1 pn Salt
Mash bread and garlic in mortar together with salt to taste. Stirring
constantly in the same direction, add olive oil very gradually. When
mixture is as thick as a good mayonnaise, add lemon juice or vinegar.
Still stirring, gradually add remaining olive oil. This recipe makes
1 cup of sauce.

Comments: Classic Catalan all-i-oli, used on fish, meat, vegetables,
and salads, is made without egg yolks. This requires the use of many
raw garlic cloves---too many for all but true garlic enthusiasts. The
addition of bread in this recipe permits the use of less garlic.
All-i-oli is easy to make providing certain rules are observed, rules
equally applicable to mayonnaise.  The ingredients, particularly the
olive oil, must be at room temperature.  The oil must be be added
very gradually and the sauce must be stirred in the same direction
all the while. All-i-oli will keep several days under refrigeration.
