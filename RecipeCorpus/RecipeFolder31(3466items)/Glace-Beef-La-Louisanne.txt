Title: Glace Beef La Louisanne
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1    3 lb. rump roast
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 c  Whiskey or bourbon
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Natural tenderizer - papaya
Or peach juice
1 tb Finely ground black pepper
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts and
Pistachio nuts
1 c  Broccoli tips, steamed until
Soft
1. Carefully trim excess fat and then cut the rump so it forms a long
strip (about 1/2 inch thick) and the width of the rump roast.

2. Carefully smooth the black pepper thoroughly over all the stripped
rump roast.  Set the roast in a shallow pan (large enough to hold
roast) and smother roast in marinade.  Cover and chill for several
hours, the longer the better.

3. Unroll the stripped rump roast and fill with the nut and broccoli
tips. Roll the roast and tie well so filling does not fall out.
Place on a rotisserie.  Use the marinade to baste.  Cook for at least
2 hours. Remove from spit and remove ties.

Serving suggestion: Slice thin and serve on a bed of mixed rice,
onions, and carrots.
