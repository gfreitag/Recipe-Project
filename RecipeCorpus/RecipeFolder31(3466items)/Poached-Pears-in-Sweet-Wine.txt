Title: Poached Pears in Sweet Wine
Categories: Side dish, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Sweet white wine
1    1" strip orange zest
2    Ripe pears
Combine the wine and orange zest in a deep nonreactive pan.

Peel the pears. Slice them in half lengthwise and remove the core.
Place the pears in the pot with the wine. Bring to a boil over high
heat and then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Poach the
pears for about 35 minutes or until tender. Test for doneness by
piercing a pear with a toothpick; it should go in easily. Gently
remove pears from liquid.

Poached pears may be served hot, cold, or at room temperature. If not
serving immediately, cool the poaching liquid and cover the pears
with it.
