until the skins are charred and peeling on all sides, about 5 mins.
Remove from the grill and cool completely. Discard the skins and
seeds. Finely chop the tomato flesh. Put the chopped tomatoes into a
fine sieve placed over a large bowl and let stand and drain for 30
mins. Discard the drained tomato juices.

3. In a medium bowl, combine the drained chopped tomatoes, lemon
juice, shallots, herbs, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in the oil.
Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

served on greens, also.
