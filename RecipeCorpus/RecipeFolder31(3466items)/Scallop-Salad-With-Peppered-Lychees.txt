Combine coconut cream and garlic in a bowl, add scallops and toss to
coat. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours to marinate. Strain scal-
lops and reserve marinade.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan, add palm sugar, chilli jam and
lime leaves and cook over medium to high heat for 1 minute, or until
sugar and jam are well combined. Add reserved marinade, soy and fish
sauce and heat until almost boiling. Add scallops and simmer gently
(do not boil as mixture will curdle) for 2-3 minutes, or until
scallops are barely opaque. Remove scallops with a slotted spoon to a
bowl. Reserve poaching liquid.

Arrange starfruit on serving plates. Toss scallops with peppered
lychees, lychee poaching syrup, remaining oil and 1 cup scallop
cooking liquid. Spoon into the centre of arranged starfruit and
sprinkle with snowpea sprouts and freshly ground black pepper. Serves
6.

Peppered lychees: Combine 1kg of lychees, peeled and seeded, 2 cups
white vinegar, 220g (2 cups) sugar, 2 thinly sliced cloves of garlic,
10cm piece of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced and 2 tablespoons
crushed black peppercorns in a large, heavy saucepan. Bring to the
boil and simmer for about 15 minutes. Spoon into sterilised glass
jars, seal and store in the refrigerator.  Will keep for up to 3
months. (Canned Iychees can be substituted - drain off syrup and
poach Iychees as above, reducing cooking time to 5 minutes only.)
