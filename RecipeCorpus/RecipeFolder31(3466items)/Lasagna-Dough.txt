Categories: Pasta, Information
Yield: 1 servings

1/4 ts Salt
3    Eggs
This recipe was posted to be used with Squash Lasagna, but is basic
and can be used for any recipe calling for lasagna noodles.

Mound flour on pastry board. Make well in center.

Add salt and eggs. Using spatula, slowly incorporate eggs into flour.
When most of flour is incorporated, knead until dough forms smooth,
firm ball. Divide pasta into 2 parts.

Flatten dough with heel of hand. Set pasta machine rollers to widest
setting. Insert dough and turn handle with 1 hand while supporting
dough with other.

Pass entire piece of dough between rollers.

Dust dough with flour, fold in thirds and pass through machine again.

Repeat folding and rolling procedure until dough is smooth and
satiny. This may require 4 to 6 passes. Tighten rollers 1 to 2
notches.

Lightly flour dough and pass through machine again. Keep passing
dough and tightening rollers 1 or 2 notches until dough is thin
enough to see hand through.

Lay dough flat on work surface. Cut in pieces to fit 11x7 pan (for
Squash Lasagna). Don't worry if size is not perfect; layers can
always be patched. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and set aside.
