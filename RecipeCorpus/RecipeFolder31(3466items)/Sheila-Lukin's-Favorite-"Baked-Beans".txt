Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Dried baby lima beans
2    Bay leaves
6 sl Bacon
1 c  Celery, coarsely chopped
2/3 c  Yellow onion, chopped
1/2 c  Bell pepper, chopped
2/3 c  Cilantro, minced
1 c  Ketchup
2/3 c  Light molasses
1 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Chili powder
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Salt
1 pn Black pepper
1 pn Cayenne
1. Rinse lima beans well. Place in a large heavy pot with water to
cover and soak overnight.

2. Drain lima beans; add bay leaves and 6 cups of water. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered for 30 minutes, until beans
are tender. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.

3. Preheat oven to 325F. Meanwhile, brown 2 slices of bacon in a
non-stick skillet over medium heat. Remove from skillet, crumble, and
set aside. Add celery, onion, bell pepper, cilantro and garlic to the
bacon fat in the same skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside.

4. Drain all but 1 cups cooking liquid from beans. Discard bay
leaves. Stir in cooked bacon, celery mixture, ketchup, molasses, dry
mustard, chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and cayenne.

5. Place beans in a shallow baking dish and cover with remaining 4
slices of bacon. Bake uncovered for 1 hours. Remove from oven and let
sit for 10 minutes to allow beans to absorb the sauce.
