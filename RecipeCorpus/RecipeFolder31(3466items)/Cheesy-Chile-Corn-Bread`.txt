1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Butter a 13 by 9-inch baking pan. 2. In
a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and
salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the buttermilk, eggs, and
melted butter. Stir just until combined; do not overmix. Stir in the
cheese and chile pepper. Spread evenly in the baking pan. 3. Bake
until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out
clean, 30 to 35 mins. Serve warm or at room temperture. Note: If you
have blue cornmeal, you can use it to make this bread, but you may
have to use a little more buttermilk to get a batter of the right
thickness. Blue cornmeal has a slightly stronger absorption rate than
the yellow cornmeal. Makes 9 to 12 servings from Clyde Nelson of The
