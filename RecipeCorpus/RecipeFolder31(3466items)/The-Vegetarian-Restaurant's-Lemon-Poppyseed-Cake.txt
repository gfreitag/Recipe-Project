The recipe was requested by Diane Silver of Willowdale, Ontario who
writes:

The Lemon Poppyseed Cake at The Vegetarian Restaurant ( 4 Dundonald
St., Toronto, (416) 961-9522 is "absolutely enjoyable and I am hoping
you can publish their version of this classic cake for me".

"We are pleased to share this recipe and suspect the request came
because the cake is unusually moist and has a wonderful strong lemon
flavour", says Susan Stachyra, who manages the bakeshop where
desserts for the downtown restaurant and The West End Vegetarian
Restaurant are turned out. Before getting into the baking business 1
1/2 years ago, the former school teacher from North Bay, Ontario says
that baking was a hobby. Typed into Meal Master format by Eric Decker

Editor's note: If there is any way humanly possible: use real demerara
sugar. Take my word for it, it is near impossible to duplicate it by
adding molasses to granulated sugar. It looks okay but the flavour
just is NOT right for the purist. Posted by Eric to Fido Cooking
