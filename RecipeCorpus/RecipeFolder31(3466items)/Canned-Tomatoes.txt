3 lb Fresh tomatoes
EQUIPMENT: Boiling water bath canner should be deep enough that with
the rack on the bottom, jars have room for at least 2 inches of water
over the tops. The rack is necessary because if the jars sit on the
bottom of the canner they could break during the boiling time of
processing. The lid is needed to keep water boiling gently without
evaporating before canning time is up. Use 1 quart or 2 pint jars for
each 3 pounds of fresh tomatoes to be canned. The wide mouth funnel
helps keep the rims of the jars cleaner as you fill them. Use the jar
lifter or tongs to lift the hot jars from the canner at the end of
the processing time without burning yourself. The timer is very
important to process the food for the correct amount of time in order
for the jars to seal properly and to keep the food from spoiling
after canning. Use the plastic or wooden knife to free any bubbles
from the jars to keep food from spoiling after canning. Make sure it
is long enough to reach the bottom of the jar you are using. Use a
wire cooling rack or folded towels to protect both the hot jars and
whatever surface they are set on to cool. Use a clean, damp cloth to
wipe the rims of the jars so they are thoroughly clean before putting
on clean, warm lids so the jars will seal properly.

BASIC STEPS: 1. Thoroughly clean and set out all equipment before
beginning. 2. Make sure to inspect jars carefully and discard any with
nicks in the rim or cracks, or food will not seal properly and jars
may break during processing. Keep jars, lids and bands hot in a pan
of hot water. 3. Prepare the tomatoes for canning.
2-1/2 to 3-1/2 lbs fresh tomatoes yields 1 quart canned
yields 10 quarts
yields 15 to 20 quarts
30 pounds (1 lug)
53 pounds (1 bushel)

PROCEDURE: 1. Choose fresh, firm, red-ripe perfect tomatoes. Be sure
they have no black spots, cracks, or soft spots. Imperfections could
harbor microorganisms that are harmful.  Prepare only enough tomatoes
at one time for 1 canner full. 2. In a large saucepan heat several
inches of water to boiling.  Wash and core tomatoes. Use a slotted
spoon and dip tomatoes into water for 1 minute or until skin breaks.
Remove from boiling water and dip into cold, or set aside while you
finish dipping the rest of the tomatoes into the boiling water to
loosen skins. When cool enough to handle, slip off skins. 3. Pack the
tomatoes into the jars, pressing each one gently into jar so that
juice rises around it keeping air bubbles from forming. Fill jars
only to within 1/2 inch of top to leave room for expansion during
processing without popping off lids.  By gently pressing down the
tomatoes as you go, you should create enough juice so that you do not
need to add any water to finish filling the jar.  If any air bubbles
remain after jar is filled, use non-metal thin tool down side of jar
to release bubbles. 4. Carefully wipe rim of jar with clean damp
cloth to make sure it is very clean before putting on lids and bands.
5. Put on lids and bands, carefully place on rack in canner so that
jars do not touch each other or bump into the side of the canner.
Add hot water to 2 inches above tops of jars. 6. Cover canner and
bring canner to gentle, rolling boil and set timer for 35 minutes for
pint jars or 45 minutes for quarts.  Adjust heat during the
processing so that the water boils gently but steadily.  Have a pan
of extra hot water on stove so that if the water evaporates during
the processing time, you can add boiling water to keep at least 1
inch over tops of jars at all times. 7. When the processing time is
up, carefully lift jars out of canner and place jars several inches
apart on rack or folded towels in a place without drafts to cool.

==== ==== <<***** Split Message. Part 2 Of 2 *****>> a cold draft on
the hot jars or they may break with the sudden temperature change.
Let cool, undisturbed for 12 hours, do not cover, do not tip jars
when moving them from canner to cooling space or food will touch lids
and cause them not to seal. 8. When jars are completely cool, remove
screw bands and check to make sure lids are depressed and there is no
leakage if jars are tipped. If the center of the lid can be pressed
down or there is any leakage when jar is tipped, place jar in
refrigerator and use immediately, or pour into another hot, clean jar
and reprocess. If jars are sealed, wipe with clean damp cloth, label
and store in cool dry place where they won't freeze. You can put into
boxes with lids to protect them from light. Submitted By DOROTHY
