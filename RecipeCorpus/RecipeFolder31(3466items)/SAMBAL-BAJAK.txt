1 tb Trasi (dried
-shrimp paste)
1 ts Salt
5 tb Tamarind liquid
2 tb Sugar
Chop the chilies, onion and garlic in a food processor.  In a small
frying pan, saute this mixture in oil until well-cooked.  Do not
brown.  Add the kemiri nuts, laos, trasi and salt.  Stir and mash
until it is well blended. Add the tamarind liquid and sugar; simmer
until the oil separates out. Cool and serve cold.

NOTES:

*  Fried chili-pepper sambal relish -- Indonesia is not known to have
nuclear weapon capability, but visitors to Djakarta often suspect
that if enough Sambal Bajak is put into an artillery shell it will
have the same general effect. Indonesian hosts normally warn
Westerners that this is "an acquired taste."

*  Laos is a form of ginger.  Other names for it are galangal, Java
root, galingale, or lengkuas.  If you can't find it, use about 1 t of
powdered ginger mixed with about 1/4 t of powdered cinnamon.  Trasi
is shrimp paste; it can be left out. Tamarind liquid is made by
soaking dried tamarind pulp in hot water for 1 hour and then
straining. To make about 5 T of tamarind liquid, use about 1/4 cup of
pulp and about 1/2 cup of hot water.

: Difficulty:  easy if you have the ingredients.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
