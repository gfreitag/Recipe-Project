Lesley flowers, who developed the recipe in Recipe #1, learned to
barbecue from the late Albert Steinbach of Baton Rouge.  "Mr
Steiney", as he was called, is till referred to as "the barbecue
king" around Baton Rouge. This is his original recipe which was also
cooked in an outdoor barbecue oven.

Mix all of the ingredients together and blend well.  Dip the meat in a
separate pan of vinegar and then into the sauce.  Sprinkle chili
powder over the meat and place in a large shallow pan and cover with
the sauce. Cook in the oven on medium heat for 2 to 3 hours, turning
the meat every 30 minutes. From Cow Country Cusine by Kathy G. Mc
