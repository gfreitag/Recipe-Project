Title: Peach Chutney
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit, Condiments, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 cups
3 lb Peeled, pitted peaches
-- cut into small chunks
3/4 c  White or cider vinegar
3 c  Water
1 lb Brown and/or white sugar
1    Head of garlic
8 sl Crystallized ginger
4    Red chili peppers
1 ts Salt
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Ground cloves
Put peaches, vinegar and water into a pot and bring to a boil.  Add
sugar and continue to cook.

Meanwhile, separate and peel garlic cloves.  Remove stems from chili
peppers (and seeds as well, if a mild chutney is desired).  Mince
garlic, chilies, and ginger, then add them to peach mixture.

Stir in remaining ingredients and cook until mixture is thick and
reduced to about 6 cups.  Stir often, and reduce heat if necessary to
prevent burning.

Preserve this chutney at your own risk; I have no idea if the
proportions given are safe for home canning!  Me, I'll just keep it
in the 'fridge since it's likely to be consumed within a couple of
weeks. :-)
