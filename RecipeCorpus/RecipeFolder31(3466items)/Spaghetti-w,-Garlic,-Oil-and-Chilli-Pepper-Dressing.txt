Boil the spaghetti in a large pan of salted water until it is tender
but still firm to the bite. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Cook the
whole garlic cloves and the pieces of chilli in olive oil over
moderate heat until the garlic is golden but not brown. Using a

Italian name: Spaghetti Aglio Olio E Peperoncino. "This marvellously
spicy spaghetti dish, which comes from the Abruzzo, can be made
hotter still by chopping both the chilli and the garlic finely, and
leaving them in the sauce. No cheese is served with this dish."
