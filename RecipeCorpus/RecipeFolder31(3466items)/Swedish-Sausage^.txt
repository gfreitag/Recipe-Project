Title: Swedish Sausage^
Categories: Meats, Sausage, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 lb Beef
1 1/2 lb Pork
Potatoes
Salt and pepper
1    To 2 onions, chopped
Grind together the beef and pork. Grind an equal amount of potatoes.
Add salt and pepper to taste and mix thoroughly. Put into casings;
boil slowly for one hour. You can leave out the onions and it's still
good. Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts
or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the
book, typos and all.
