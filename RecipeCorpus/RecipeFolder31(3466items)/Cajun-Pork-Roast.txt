Here is an easy and absolutely delicious recipe!  Serve it with some
wild rice or boiled new potatoes, a salad, corn bread and a nice ice
cold beer! Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine all the seasonings
in a bowl and mix well.  Rub the pork loin lightly with oil covering
all surfaces. Sprinkle the mixture of spices over the loin - covering
the entire loin. Pat gently to ensure full coverage.  Place in a
shallow pan and roast for approximately 1 hour or until no longer
pink. (Use a meat thermometer if

necessary)  Remove from the oven and let stand at least 5 minutes
before slicing.  If there are any juices left in the pan, reserve and
pour over the sliced meat.
