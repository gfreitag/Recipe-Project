MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
1 c  Sugar, powdered
2 tb Lemon juice
MAKE THE DOUGH:  Soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl.  Mix flour
with sugar and salt.  Cut in the butter until mixture has a fine,
even crumb.

Beat eggs and extra yolks; mix with yeast, then stir into the flour
mixture. Add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well.

Knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes.  Divide in half and
roll each half into a 12 inch square.  Cover.

MAKE THE FILLING:  Melt butter in a large pan.  Add poppy seed and
stir-fry for 3 minutes.  Add honey, lemon juice and raisins to poppy
seeds.  Cover and remove from heat. Let stand for 10 minutes.

Beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form.  Fold in
orange and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture.

Spread half of the filling on each dough square (after you uncover
them). Roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges.
Place on greased baking sheets and cover.  Let rise until doubled in
bulk (approx. 1 1/2 hours).

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Bake about 45 minutes, then remove
from oven and cool.

MAKE THE ICING:  Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth.
Spread this mixture evenly over the rolls.

NOTES:

*  Poppy seed rolls -- This recipe could be used as part of a
12-course meal known in Polish as Wigilia, or on its own. Wigilia is
eaten after sundown on Christmas Eve. Yield: Makes 2 rolls.

*  You can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle.  Specialty food
stores sell grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds.  Some
spice shops sell poppy seeds already ground, but like all spices they
lose their freshness much more rapidly after they are ground. This
year (1987) in Poland, the people are having a very hard time finding
enough poppy seeds for their strucle z makiem because there is a
government crackdown on the growing of all poppies in an attempt to
control opium production.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
