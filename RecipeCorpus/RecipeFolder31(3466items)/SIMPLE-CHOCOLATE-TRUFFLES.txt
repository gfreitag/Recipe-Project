good recipe for lazy chocolate freaks.  They're not as good as the
ones you buy in good candy stores, but they're still yummy.

*  If you're adventurous, try substituting the liqueur of your choice
for the vanilla.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 20 minutes rolling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
