Put a few drops of cool water and a few drops of lemon juice or
vinegar in a mortar with garlic.  Mash garlic well. Add raw egg yolks
and blend. Add olive oil very gradually while stirring in the same
direction. When all the olive oil has been absorbed, stir in the
mustard. Vary the amount of mustard according to the strength of the
product and your own preference. Add salt if necessary. This recipe
makes 1 1/2 cups of sauce. Comments: All-i-oli is easy to make
providing certain rules are observed, rules equally applicable to
mayonnaise. The ingredients, particularly the olive oil, must be at
room temperature. The oil must be be added very gradually and the
sauce must be stirred in the same direction all the while. All-i-oli
will keep several days under refrigeration. Recipe Source: THE
