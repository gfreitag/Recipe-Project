Categories: Cowboy, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 servings
7    Dried New Mexican Chile
Peppers *
2 c  Boiling Water
1 cn (16 Oz) Tomatoes, Peeled
In Juice -- drained
2    Cloves Garlic -- minced
1/2 ts Ground Cumin
1/2 ts Dried Oregano
* Use mild to medium-hot peppers. This sauce is as spicy as the
chiles you choose to use. Reserve the soking liquid for use in making
chili.

1. Rinse the chile peppers, split them open, and remove and reserve
the seeds. Remove and discard the stems. In a medium bowl, soak the
chiles in the boiling water. Let stand until they are softened, about
20 mins. Drain the chiles, reserving the soaking liquid.

2. In a blender, combine the soaked chiles with 1/4 cup of the soaking
liquid and the tomatoes, garlic, cumin, and oregano, process until
smooth. (Taste the sauce; if you like it hotter, add some of the
reserved chile pepper seeds, Also, if you fell the sauce could be a
little thinner, add more of the reserved soaking liquid.) Cover and
refrigerate for up to 1 week.
