Categories: Holiday, Beverages
Yield: 1 servings
8 c  Water
2    Or more apple-cinnamon
-herbal tea bags
1    To 2 Tblsp honey, (optional)
Put your coffeemaker to work brewing fragrant pots of apple-cinnamon
herbal tea. The tea perfumes your kitchen with its spicy, cheerful
aroma. Plus you have a welcoming hot drink--with no calories,
caffeine or alcohol--ready to pour when company drops in.

Add 8 cups water to your coffeemaker. Put two apple-cinnamon herbal
tea bags (more if you like a stronger tea) in the pot. Use no coffee
or filter paper, but make sure the filter basket is in place. Turn
on; when bubbling stops, your tea is ready. Remove tea bags and add 1
to 2 tablespoons of honey, if desired. Return pot to hot plate, to
keep tea piping hot and ready when you are.
