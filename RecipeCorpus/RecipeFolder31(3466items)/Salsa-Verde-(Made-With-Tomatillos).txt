Yield: 1 servings
15    Tomatillos (approx)
1 md Sized yellow onion
1/2 bn Cilantro
1 ts Garlic
1    Jalapeno pepper
1 ea Salt (must use some to bring
Out the flavor of the

Throw everything into the food processor and puree. My 1/2 mexican
roommate used to then throw the salsa into a pan and quick fry it for
a few minutes. Tastes great either way.
