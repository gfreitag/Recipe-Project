Title: MATZO BREI
Categories: Breakfast, Jewish, Usenet
Yield: 2 servings
2    Matzot (plural of
-matzah)
2    Eggs (or 3)
Salt and pepper, to taste
Oil or margarine
1/4 c  Cottage cheese, well-
-drained (optional)
Break matzot into medium-sized pieces and place in colander or
strainer. Pour boiling water over them and drain quickly (they should
be slightly limp, not soggy). Mix together matzot, eggs and seasoning
in a bowl. (You can add cottage cheese at this point.)

Heat the margarine or oil in a frying pan, and pour in the mixture.
You can either (a) heat one side until brown, then flip over, like an
omelette or (b) heat while continually stirring, like scrambled eggs
(my tradition). Serve hot.

NOTES:

*  Traditional Passover breakfast -- When I was growing up, the main
thing that kept us kids happy about matzah-for-eight-days was my
father making "matzah 'n' eggs" for breakfast nearly every morning.
I didn't even know it had a "real" name. As I was beginning to stock
my own kitchen, the very first Passover items I bought were a bowl, a
colander and a frying pan. Yield: Serves 1-2.

*  Any printed recipe for matzo brei that I've ever seen says "serve
with honey or jam."  However, in our family, this dish is considered
a savoury, not a sweet, and we're much likelier to sprinkle a bit
more salt and pepper on top.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes.
: Precision:  is to laugh.
