Categories: Appetizers, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Chana dall (split
-yellow peas)
3 sm Onions (button-sized)
6    Onion springs
4    Watercress sprigs
2    Green chilies

Soak the dall in cold water for a day, then drain thoroughly.

Chop all the vegetable ingredients finely.  Place the dall in a food
processor and process to a paste. Decant into a bowl, add turmeric,
salt and pepper, and vegetable ingredients and mix well.

Heat oil in a deep-frying pan.  When it is hot, roll walnut-sized
pieces of the paste in the palm of the hand and drop in to the oil to
fry until golden brown. Remove from the oil and drain the gateaux on
kitchen towels. Serve hot, with drinks.

NOTES:

*  Savoury spice balls -- This recipe is from the kitchen of Fred
Hopper, and is originally from the isle of Mauritius. Fred often
serves these as delicious late-night snacks, to accompany drinks.

*  The choice of drinks served will depend on how spicy you make the
gateaux: cool beer or lager usually goes down well.
