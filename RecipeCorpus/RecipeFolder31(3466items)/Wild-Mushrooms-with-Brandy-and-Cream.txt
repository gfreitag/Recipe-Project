Title: Wild Mushrooms with Brandy and Cream
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 2 servings
4 c  Mixed wild mushrooms
-(2 cups after sweating)
1 tb Butter
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Shallots, minced
2 tb Brandy
2/3 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper to taste
Lemon juice
2 ts Chopped herbs
-such as parsley, chives
-chervil (opt)
Trim mushrooms of any tough stems. Wipe each clean with a damp paper
towel and wipe dry.

Slice or quarter the mushrooms. Place mushrooms with the butter in a
large skillet and sweat gently over low heat. Stir occasionally. When
mushrooms have wilted, about 15 minutes, drain them. Reserve liquid
for another use.

Heat olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms and
saut them, stirring until slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the
garlic and shallots and saut another minutes, stirring. Don't let
them brown.

Remove pan from heat and add brandy; the brandy will ignite, so be
careful and stand back as you do this. Return the pan to the heat (if
the brandy hasn't ignited already, it will now) and cook rapidly
until the brandy has almost evaporated, about 15 seconds.

Add the cream, salt, and pepper and reduce the cream over high heat
until a light sauce-like consistency is reached, about 1 minute. Add
a squeeze of lemon and the herbs if desired and serve.
