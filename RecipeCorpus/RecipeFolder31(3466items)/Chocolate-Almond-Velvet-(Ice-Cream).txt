Title: Chocolate Almond Velvet (Ice Cream)
Categories: Jewish, Ice cream
Yield: 1 servings
1 cn (16 Oz) Chocolate Syrup
1 cn (16 Oz) Chocolate
-Condensed Milk
4 c  Whipping Cream
2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Blanched Almonds
Before starting, make sure you have a very large plastic container
with a tight fitting lid and enough room in your freezer to store it.
Measure 6 cups of water into the container and see if there is enough
space left to use an electric beater without it splattering over. Mix
together the syrup, milk and cream until blended. Pour the mixture
into the plastic container, cover it and place it in the freezer to
get icy cold. Meanwhile, chop the almonds coarsely and saute them in
a little butter until they are golden. Remove the mixture from the
freezer. Stir in the vanilla, and beat the ice cream at high speed
with a hand mixer until it is the consistency of softened ice cream.
This takes a fair bit of time. Fold in the almonds, store the ice
cream in the freezer. It is better if made one day ahead.
