NOTES:

*  A crunchy sesame seed granola -- I got this recipe from the back
of a page from a green engineering pad with a circuit diagram on the
other side. Where it came from before that I do not know. Yield:
About 6 servings.

*  These are much better than any store bought granola.  I eat it as
desert or carry it instead of gorp when backpacking. It is very good
eaten straight, with no milk.
