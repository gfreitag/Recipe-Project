Title: Harlequin Salad^
Categories: Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Red cabbage
1 c  Regular cabbage
1 c  Peas
1/2 c  Beets
1    Onion, diced
1/2 c  Carrot, diced
Salt & pepper
French dressing
Shave cabbage thin. Cook peas, beets and carrot till tender; drain and
chill. Mix all vegetables or arrange them in layers or heaps. The
effect is better if they are mixed and they are also easier to season
and arrange. Pour on French dressing an hour before serving. Pass
more French dressing at the table.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
