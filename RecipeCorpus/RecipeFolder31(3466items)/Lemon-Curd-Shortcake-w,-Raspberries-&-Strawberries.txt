Sift together the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a bowl. Cut
in the butter until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in the milk, 1 Tbsp at
a time, to make a dough that holds together.

Gather the dough into a ball and divide in half.  Flatten to 2 3-inch
circles about 1 inch thick.  Place the shortcakes 2 inches apart on an
ungreased baking sheet.

Bake at 425Ã¸F until lightly browned, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove
from the oven.  Place shortcakes on a wire rack to cool while
preparing the lemon curd.

To serve, split the warm biscuits open.  Spoon 3 Tbsp lemon curd on
each. Reserve remaining for another recipe or pass on the side.  Top
each with half the raspberries and strawberries.  Cover with top half
of biscuits. Add dollop of whipped cream to each and garnish with a
mint sprig. Serve warm.

heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Mix well.  Cook over low heat, stirring

Pour lemon curd through a wire sieve into a bowl.  Curd can be served
warm or cooled to room temperature.  Makes about 3/4 cup.

NOTE:  If desired, curd can be made a day in advance.  Cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate.
