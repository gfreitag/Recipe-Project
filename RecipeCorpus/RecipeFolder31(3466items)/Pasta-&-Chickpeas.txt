Title: Pasta & Chickpeas
Categories: Pasta, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Dry chick peas -- soaked
Overnight
4 qt Water
1/2 c  Olive oil
7    Cloves garlic -- chopped
1/4 c  Parsley -- chopped
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
1 ts Dried oregano
4    Cloves garlic -- chopped
10 oz Spinach -- chopped
Salt and pepper
1 lb Linguini
Drain the soaked chickpeas.  Put them in a large pot with the water,
cover, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Lower the heat to medium
and add 1/4 cup of the olive oil, 3 cloves or the garlic, the
parsley, red pepper flakes and oregano.  Cook over medium heat,
uncovered, about 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the chickpeas
are very tender. Partially mash the cooked chickpeas in the pot,
using a potato masher. Keep the chickpeas warm.  In a large skillet
over low heat, heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  Add the 4
remaining cloves of garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until the garlic is golden brown. Add the spinach and
sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cover, raise the heat to medium low
and cook about 3 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes, until the spinach
is wilted.  Pour the spinach mixture into the chickpeas and mix well.
Taste for seasoning.  Cook the linguine according to the package
directions. Drain and turn into a serving bowl.  Spoon about 1/4 of
the sauce over the top and toss well.  Spoon the remaining sauce over
the top. Serve with additional black pepper, if desired.
