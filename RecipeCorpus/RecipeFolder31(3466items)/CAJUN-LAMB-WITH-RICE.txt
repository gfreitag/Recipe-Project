Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix
together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb. Let stand
for 15 minutes. Heat oil in a skillet. Sear the lamb until all sides
are browned. Remove lamb to a roasting pan. Roast lamb for 35 to 40
minutes.

While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet used
for searing the lamb.  Saute until soft.  Add tomatoes, chicken
stock, basil, lemon and chili powder.  Bring to a boil and add the
rice.  Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is absorbed.

NOTES:

*  This is a spicy lamb dish that I picked up originally from a local
newspaper.  Yield:  serves 2-3.

*  Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged
piece of meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice
mix to cover all the surfaces.  You will be slicing up the roast
before serving anyhow.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  1 hour.
: Precision:  measure the spices.
