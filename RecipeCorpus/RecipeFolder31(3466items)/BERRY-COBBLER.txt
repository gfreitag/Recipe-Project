Title: BERRY COBBLER
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Sugar (for sprinkling)
4 c  Berries (fresh or frozen)
1 c  Sugar (for the batter)
1 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter (softened)
Nutmeg
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of sugar on the
berries and place them in the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish.
Combine the remaining dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder
and salt).

Add the milk and softened butter and beat well.  Spoon the batter
over the berries.  Sprinkle some nutmeg on top.  Bake for about 45
minutes.

NOTES:

*  Berry cobbler -- This recipe was lifted from _TV Guide's_ series of
recipes from television stars. It is similar to the recipe for Berry
Pudding found in Edna Staebler's "Food That Really Schmecks" cookbook.

*  You can use pretty well any type of berry for the base.  A
favourite of mine is a combination of strawberries, raspberries and
blueberries.

*  The base of this turns out to be a bit thin and liquidy.  If you
strain the juice from the fruit, add a couple of tablespoons of flour
to the juice, and then pour the juice over the fruit in the baking
dish, the base will be semi-firm.

*  You do not need to sprinkle the full 1/2 cup of sugar on the
berries; with sweeter berries, much less will often suffice.

*  If you would like a sweeter, candy-like batter, try adding more
sugar to the batter.  I wouldn't recommend putting more than about 1
1/4 cups of sugar into the batter, though, the crust of the batter
will be very candy-like, but the centre of the batter will not
properly bake if you do.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
