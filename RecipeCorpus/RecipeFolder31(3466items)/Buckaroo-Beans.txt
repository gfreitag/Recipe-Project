Title: Buckaroo Beans
Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 lb Dried pinto beans
6 c  Water
1 sl Ham Center Slices -- Cubed
1 ea Large Onion -- coarsely
Chopped
2 ea Garlic Cloves -- minced
1 sm Bay Leaf
2 c  Canned tomatoes
1/2 c  Sweet peppers -- chopped
2 ts Chili Powder
2 tb Brown Sugar
1/2 ts Dry Mustard
1/4 ts Dried oregano -- OR
Ground Cumin
Salt -- to taste
May use Smoked Ham Hocks instead of Ham Slice if desired. Soak beans
overnight or boil for 2 minutes and let stand for one hour in 6 cups
water. Cut ham in 1/2- inch cubes; add to beans and soaking water
along with onion, garlic and bay leaf. Bring to boiling point; cover
tightly. Cook at low heat for 1 1/2 hrs or until beans are almost
tender.

Add remaining ingredients except salt. Allow to simmer, covered, for
2 hrs, stirring once or twice. Taste and add salt if necessary. There
should be enough liquid left on the beans to resemble a medium-thick
gravy. The covered pot may be placed in a 325 F oven after the first
step, to finish cooking.  While this dish may be served immediately
after cooking, like any other bean recipe it does not gain it's full
flavor until it has been left standing in the refrigerator (covered)
for 6 to 8 hours (the longer the better) and then re-heated.
