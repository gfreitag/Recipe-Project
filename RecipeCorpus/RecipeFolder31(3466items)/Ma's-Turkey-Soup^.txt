Title: Ma's Turkey Soup^
Categories: Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1    Turkey carcass, skin &
Giblets
1 lg Onion, sliced
3    To 4 carrots, sliced
3    To 4 stalks celery, with
Leaves, chopped
1    Onion, sliced
1 tb Parsley
Salt & pepper to taste
Few handfuls of egg noodles
Put turkey bones, skin and giblets in a large pot and cover with
water. Add onion, bring to a boil and simmer for several hours.
Strain. Skim off fat and pick meat from bones. Put stock and meat
back into the pot and add the remaining ingredients. Simmer until the
vegetables are done. Add noodles the last 10 minutes before serving.
A batch of popovers served with the soup makes it seem less
"ordinary". Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain
amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in
the book, typos and all.
