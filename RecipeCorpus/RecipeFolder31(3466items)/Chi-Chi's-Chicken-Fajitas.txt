Favorite trick was from
-Chi-Chi's [ha!  I NEVER
-signed that non-disclosure
Agreement] .... the
-absolute best marinade for
-chicken (we used it for
Our fajitas) is margarita
-mix.  Yes, just go out and
-find your favorite
Margarita mix (Mr & Mrs T's
-is good) or a little sweet
-& sour, put the
Chicken breasts in a
-shallow pan and cover with
-the mix.  Marinate at
Least overnight, preferably
-for 24 hours.  NUMM!
