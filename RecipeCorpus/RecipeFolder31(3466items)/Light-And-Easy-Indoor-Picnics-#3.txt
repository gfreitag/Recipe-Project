This second picnic has something for everyone in the family. The
Cucumber Yogurt Soup is a wonderful recipe I learned from a friend in
the South of France. The soup is creamy without being rich and the
dditional chopped vegetables and eggs made the soup like a white
gazpacho. Tote the soup in a thermos to keep it chilled and
carryalong the garnishes in sealed baggies to add when serving the
soup inmugs or plastic bowls. The Buttermilk Baked Chicken is one of
my favorite recipes. It is a perfect picnic chicken, light and crispy
but without the added fat of frying. I used to send my son to school
with several pieces of thisdelicious chicken and he actually ate it
without the usual "barter for Twinkies routine." Remember to bring
plenty of wet napkins because this is great finger food. The berry
dessert is a feast of berries. It utilizes the fresh berries of
summer and tops them with a puree of berries. If you like, purchase
one of the low-fat or non-fat poundcakes, slice them in advance,
place a piece of cake on a plate, topwith fresh berries, and spoon
over the Fresh Berry Sauce. A few mint sprigs make a nice
presentation even in the great outdoors so tote them along in a
sealed baggie. And...finally, I want to leave you with a few
practical picnic suggestions. Number one ++ do not set your picnic
basket on top of a sprinkler head. Number two ++ don't wear a
bee-hive hairdo. And, number three ++ don't pack so much that you
need a pack of mules to get you there and back! Eating outdoors
should be great fun ++ whether you are picnicking by the ocean, at a
city park, or in your own backyard. You can have a picnic that is
elegant, healthy, and fun.
