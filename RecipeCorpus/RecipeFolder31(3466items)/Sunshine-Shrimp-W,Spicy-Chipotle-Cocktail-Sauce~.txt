If you are multiplying the recipe for a large party, do not cook more
than 5 pounds of shirmp in a batch.  Cooking time may need to be
adjusted for large batches.

To make Cocktail sauce, combine all the ingredients and mix well.
Regrigerate until needed.  The sauce can be prepared up to 5 days in
advance.

Peel and devein the shrimp, reserving the shells.  Combine the orange
juice, lime juice, zests, cumin, salt, cinnamon, cayenne, and the
shrimp shells in a medium saucepan.  Bring the mixture to a rapid
boil over high heat.  Stir in the shrimp, cover tightly and
immediately replace the cover. Cook 30 seconds longer.  Remove the
pan from the heat, stir the shrimp again and let cool 30 minutes in
the cooking liquid, uncoverd; the shrimp should be just cooked
through when cooled.  Chill the shrimp in the liquid, covered.  (The
shrimp can be prepared 2-3 days in advance.

Toss the shrimp in the liquid, then use a slotted spoon to scoop the
shrimp onto a serving platter or over ice, discarding the remaining
liquid and shells.  Serve with the chilled Chipotle cocktail sauce
and lime wedges along side.
