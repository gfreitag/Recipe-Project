their flavors well: Basil, Chives, Dill, Marjoram, Mint, Oregano,
Rosemary, Sage, Savory, Tarragon and Thyme. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS-Wash
and pat herbs dry on paper towel. If you are freezing basil*, mint,
oregano, parsley or sage, remove the leaves from stems. Freeze
chervil, dill, marjoram, rosemary, savor, tarragon and thyme on their
stems. Package herbs with care in plastic freezer bags or containers;
do not crowd packages to prevent crushing herbs. Place herb bags in
frreezer on top of heavier containers or place all your herbs in
their individual bags in 1 large plastic container to protect them.
Label all packages with herb name and date. Freeze up to 1 year.
*Basil leaves tend to discolor, so before you freeze them, place in
boiling water for 2 seconds, then rinse in cold water. Pat leaves
dry. Freeze as directed. Submitted By DIANE LAZARUS   On   06-19-95
