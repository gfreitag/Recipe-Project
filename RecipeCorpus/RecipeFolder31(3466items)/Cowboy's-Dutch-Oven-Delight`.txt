Yield: 1 servings
Double Recipe For Sourdough
Bread
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Ground Cinnamon
3/4 c  Butter -- melted
1. Make the sourdough bread dough through step 4. Tear off pieces
about the size of golf balls and roll them between your floured hands
to form smooth balls. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and
cinnamon. Dip the balls in the melted butter, thenr oll in the
cinnamon sugar. Place each ball in a well-buttered 14-in Dutch oven.
Drizzle any remaining butter on top, and sprinkle with the remaining
cinnamon sugar. Cover the Dutch oven with the lid and let balls rise
in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 hrs.

2. Build a charcoal fire with 28 briquets and let them burm until
they are coated with white ash. Using a garden spade or kitchen tongs
(protect your hands with oven mitts), spread about 10 of the coals in
a 14-inch circle, pushing the other coals to one side. Do not place
any coals in the center of the circle.

3. Place the Dutch oven over the ring of coals. Use th spade to place
the remaining 18 coals on the lid. Cook until the bread is golden
brown, about 45 mins. Let stand 10 mins, then remove from the Dutch
oven.. Serve warm, pulling off portions of the bread to eat. Makes 1
large loaf, about 12 servings from Cliff Teinert of Long X Ranch of
Kent, TX.
