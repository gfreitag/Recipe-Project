Title: Randy Pollak's Persimmon Pudding
Categories: Puddings, Holiday, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Flour
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Soda
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Milk
1 c  Persimmon pulp
1 tb Melted butter
1 c  Chopped nuts
1/2 c  Raisins
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1    Egg yolk
3/4 c  Powdered sugar
1    - 2T rum or brandy
1    Whipped egg white
1/2 c  Whipped cream
Mix the persimmon puree and the baking soda together and let it stand.
Cream together the sugar and butter, then add the egg, milk, vanilla,
(rum), and persimmon mixture. Add the remaining dry ingredients and
mix.

Pour into well-buttered pudding mold or tin can (i.e., a coffee can).
Fill them only 2/3 full. Place the mold on a trivet in a pan over a
few inches of boiling water. (I use one of those folding steamer
baskets). Cover the pan and steam over low heat for 2 hours. You will
need to add more boiling water as it evaporates. When a skewer tests
clean, it is done.

Let stand in the mold uncovered for about 15 minutes. Turn onto a
plate and let cool, or serve warm with hard sauce or whipped cream.
Beat the egg yolk with powdered sugar and rum or brandy. Fold in
whipped egg white and whipped cream.
