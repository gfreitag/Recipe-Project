Title: Hamburger Buns 4
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 buns
8 c  All purpose flour (divided)
2 pk Active dry yeast
2 c  Warm water (110 degrees)
3/4 c  Cooking oil
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Salt
3    Eggs
In a large mixing bowl, combine four cups flour and the two packages
of yeast.

Combine two cups water, the cooking oil and sugar and salt.  Add to
flour mixture; stir in three eggs.   Beat at low speed with mixer for
one minute, craping bowl.    Beat 3 minutes at high speed.  Then by
hand, stir in the four cups of remaining flour a little at a time
until you have a soft dough.

Turn out this dough on a floured surface; knead until smoth and
elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turning once - cover - let rise in
a warm place until doubled (about one hour)  Punch down, divide dough
in three portions, cover each portion and let rest another five
minutes.

Divide each portion into eight balls.  Turn ball in hands, folding
edges under to make even circle. Press ball flat between hands.
Place on greased baking sheets, pressing to form 3 1/2 inch circles.
Let rise until doubled (about 30 minutes) Bake at 375 degrees about
20 minutes or until golden brown. To test for doneness you can use an
instant therometer - fully cooked yeast breads will read 190 degrees.
