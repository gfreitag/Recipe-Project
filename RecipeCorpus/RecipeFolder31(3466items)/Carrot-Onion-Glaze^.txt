1/2 lb Small onions

Clean carrots with a scrub brush and cut longways into strips. Peel
onions and prick with a fork so they won't break. Cook onions in
boiling salted water for about 15 minutes. Add carrots and cook until
tender. Drain. Add vegetables to butter and sugar in frying pan and
cook until shiny and brown. Good as a garnish for roasts, ham or
chicken or as a side dish.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
