Title: Cornish Saffron Bread
Categories: Breads, British isl
Yield: 2 loaves
1/8 ts Saffron
1/4 c  Boiling water
1/3 c  Lukewarm water
2 ts Sugar
1 tb Yeast
3/4 c  Milk; scalded
1/3 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground cardamon
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Currants
1/4 c  Citron peal
2 ts Lemon rind
5 c  Flour.
Add saffron to boiling water and steep. Add yeast to 2 tsp. sugar and
water and keep warm to grow. Combine scalded milk, shortening, sugar,
salt and cardamon in mixing bowl. Cool and add saffron, yeast and
eggs. Beat well. Add currants, citron, lemon rind and half the flour.
Beat well. Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.
Knead until smooth and elastic. Let rise, then divide into two loaves
or 2 dozen buns and let rise. Bake at 375 F. for 30 t0 40 minutes.

I usually triple this recipe. The bread freezes well.

The old recipes do not have cardamon. If I omit cardamon I add a
little more saffron.
