Title: Veal Picatta
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
Olive oil or clarified
Butter for frying
Fresh lemon juice
Pepper & oregano for taste
1 lb Boneless veal cutlets
Flour seasoned with
Salt and lemon pepper
Dry white wine
Chicken broth
Heat oil or butter in a large frying pan until it develops a
fragrance. Meanwhile, pound the cutlets lightly (do not break the
meat), and dip in the seasoned flour.

Pop the cutlets into the pan (in batches if necessary, do not
overcrowd the pan), and brown on both sides.  Remove from the pan and
keep warm.

Pour off the excess fat, leaving just a thin film, and the brown bits
on the bottom of the pan.  Add a healthy glug of wine, and stir
wildly until the browned bits come off the bottom and begin to
dissolve.  Add chicken broth, and continue cooking, stirring, until
reduced by half (you only want a couple of tablespoons of sauce per
serving).  Add the juice of a fresh lemon, salt, pepper and oregano
to taste.  Pour the sauce over the cutlets, and serve.

We like this with pasta dressed with a little butter or olive oil and
Parmesan cheese, and a steamed green vegetable.

Sorry there are no quantities here -- I just toss stuff in the general
direction of the saute pan and keep cooking until it looks right.

If you really want to get fancy, cut a lemon into thin slices and use
the slices to garnish the meat.  A sprinkling of parsley wouldn't hurt
anything, either....
