the addition of meats.  It was served in a number of Plymouth
(Massachusetts) households once a year, on December 21, in
celebration of the date on which the Pilgrims landed."

Soak beans overnight.  Drain, cover with fresh water, and cook about 2
hours or until very tender.  Drain and work through a sieve or blend
in an electric blender.  While the beans are cooking, put chicken
(cut into serving pieces), corned beef, salt pork, and water in a
large kettle. Cook about 2 to 2-1/2 hours or until beef is tender.
