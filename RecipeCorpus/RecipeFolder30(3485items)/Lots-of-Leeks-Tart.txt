Title: Lots of Leeks Tart
Categories: Pie/tart, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Unsalted butter
1/3 c  Chicken stock or canned
-broth
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 ts Chopped fresh Italian
-parsley
10 ea Leeks - (white bulk and
-1/2-inch green), well
Rinsed and patted dry
1/3 lb Frozen puff pastry - thawed
1 ea Egg yolk
1 ts Water
1.  Preheat the oven to 400F. 2. Dice 9 of the leeks, reserving the
tenth. Set them all aside. 3. Roll the pastry out on a lightly
floured surface so that it will fit an 8-inch tart pan. Transfer the
pastry to the tart pan, and prick the bottom all over with the tines
of a fork. 4. Stir the egg yolk and water together, and using a
pastry brush, brush this egg wash all over the pastry. 5. Bake the
pastry for 7 minutes. Set it aside to cool. Leave the oven on. 6.
Melt the butter in a large skillet, and saute the diced leeks over
medium heat until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and simmer
until all the liquid has evaporated, 5 minutes. 7. Fill the cooled
crust with the leek mixture.  Slice the remaining leek into
1/4-inch-thick rounds, and decorate the top of the tar with them,
forming circles or a spiral.  Sprinkle with the pepper and parsley,
and bake until pale golden, 20 minutes.  Serve hot or at room
temperature.

4 portions.
