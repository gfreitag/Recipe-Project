Title: Taralli Scaldati Col Finocchio (Taralli with Fennel Seeds
Categories: Italian, Breads
Yield: 30 taralli
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Fennel seeds -=OR=-
2 ts Cracked black peppercorns
2 1/2 ts Dried yeast
1 c  Dry white wine, warmed
1/2 c  Olive oil
3 3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
Stir yeast into the warmed wine & let proof for 10 minutes.  Stir in
the olive oil & add then add the flour, salt, fennel/pepper. Mix
until the dough comes together, knead on a lightly floured board for
5 to 7 minutes, the presence of the olive oil should prevent it from
sticking. Knead until the dough is smooth & responsive.  Place in a
lightly oiled bowl, cover & let rise until puffy but not doubled, 1
to 1 1/4 hours.

Break off ap iece of dough the size of a lime & roll it between your
palms & fingers to form a rope 18" long & as thin as a breadstick.
Let each one rest while you roll out the rest (about 12 in all).  Cut
each piece into 6" lengths & conect their ends to form rings about 2"
in diameter. Press the ends together very firmly; pinch as tighly as
necessary, the dough will recover.  Set the rings on oiled baking
sheets, cover & let rise for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350F & bring a pot of water to a boil.  When
risen, plunge the taralli into the boiling water, a few at a time,
immersing them only until they bob to the surface.  Remove with a
slotted spoon & drain on paper towels.  Let them cool slightly.  Bake
on oiled baking sheets for about 20 to 24 minutes, until they are
crunchy.
