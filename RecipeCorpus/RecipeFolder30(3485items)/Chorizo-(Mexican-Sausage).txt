Clean the casings, rinse well with water, then pour the vinegar
through them.  Set aside.  Use a food processor or the coarse blade
of a meat grinder, grind the meat and fat.  Add the onions, garlic,
vinegar, tequila (if used), and seasonings, using the hotness of the
chile powder that your family and guests will prefer.  Stuff the
casings.  First cut the casing into 3-foot lengths and tie one end
together.  Using either a funnel or filling tube fill the length of
casing fairly loosely.  Tie off at about 4-inch intervals with heavy
thread or light string.  Place on a cookie sheet covered with wax
paper.  Set on the counter for about 2 hours and then refrigerate.
After a day, freeze what you will not use within a week or two.
Mixture should ripen for at least 8 hours before using.

NOTES:

If you have no food processor or grinder, buy triple-ground pork.
Prepare the recipe once and taste for the mildness or hotness of the
ground red chile.  Adjust to suit your taste for the next time you
make the sausage.

FREEZING:  Mold the sausage into 1/2 pound lumps and freeze between
pieces of foil inside a heavy plastic bag.  The maximum recommended
freezer storage time is 3 months.

This recipe is from Jane Butel's Tex-Mex Cookbook.  Hope that you and
your butcher friend as well as all of the people that liked the
Sowest series like this recipe for the main sausage of Mexico.
