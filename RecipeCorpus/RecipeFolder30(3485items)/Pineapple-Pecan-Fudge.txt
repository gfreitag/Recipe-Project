Title: Pineapple-Pecan Fudge
Categories: Candies
Yield: 24 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Margarine
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Pecans -- chopped
14 oz Crushed pineapple --
Drained
4 c  Sugar
1. Use a 14-ounce can of crushed pineapple. Invert over a sieve
placed in bowl to drain pineapple thoroughly.

2. Chop the pecans coarsely.

3. Combine the drained pineapple, sugar and cream in a heavy saucepan.
Stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat and bring
mixture to boiling. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.
Continue until mixture reaches 234 degrees on a candy thermometer
(soft ball stage). This will stick a little but DO NOT scrape bottom
and sides of pan; brushing down side of pan occasionally will help.

4. Remove from heat and let cool just until cool enough that you can
touch pan without being burned. DO NOT stir or disturb mixture in any
way while this is cooling.

5. Add the margarine (or butter) and the vanilla extract. Beat
vigorously until the candy loses its gloss. Stir in the pecans using
as little mixing as possible.

6. Immediately pour into 8 x 8-inch pan that has been greased with
margarine. Do not scrape the bottom or sides of pan as you are
putting the mixture into dish.

7. Let cool completely, then cut into small pieces for serving.

Yield: About twenty-four 1-1/2 inch squares.
