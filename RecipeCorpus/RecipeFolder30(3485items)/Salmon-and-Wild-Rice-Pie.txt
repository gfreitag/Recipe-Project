Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
4 cn Sockeye salmon
3    Eggs
1 1/4 c  Light sour cream
Pastry for deep 10 inch
-double crust pie
1 ts Milk
3/4 c  Wild rice

4    Green onions, sliced
2 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms

2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
Cook rice, drain and rinse.  Set aside.  Saute the onions, mushrooms
and celery until translucent and all moisture from the mushrooms has
cooked off.  Add to rice, along with the parsley, salt, pepper, and
dill. Drain salmon, and stir into rice mixture.  Beat the eggs, add
the sour cream and then mix into rice/salmon mixture. Spread into the
pie shell and cover with pastry top.  (Pastry at this point can be
brushed lightly with milk, or beaten egg)  Bake in a 400 F oven for
about 35-40 minutes until pastry has turned a nice golden brown
color. Allow to stand for about 1/2 hour before serving to allow the
salmon mixture to 'firm' up a bit. Makes 4, 6 or 8 servings,
depending on the size you want to cut the pie.
