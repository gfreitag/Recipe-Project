coffee may be substituted for brandy.

Cream shortening and orange rind together. Add brown sugar gradually
and cream thoroughly. Blend in well beaten eggs. Beat hard for 1-2
minutes to make a smooth batter. Sift flour, soda, salt and spices
together and add to creamed mixture alternately with the molasses and

floured 8" X 12" X 2-1/2" pan. bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
