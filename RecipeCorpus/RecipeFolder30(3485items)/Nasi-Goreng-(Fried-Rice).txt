The name Nasi Goreng means simply 'fried rice', and it is really a
collective description of an indefinite number of slightly differing
dishes.  You can vary the trimmings and garnishes to suit your taste;
but even the most elaborate Nasi Goreng is quick to make.  It is a
particularly good luncheon dish. Boil the rice a good long time
before you intend to fry it; you can fry freshly boiled rice, but the
Nasi Goreng will be better if the boiled rice is allowed to cool. Two
hours is a satisfactory interval. Leaving the rice to cool overnight,
however, gives less good results-the rice has time to go dry and
stale. An important point to note here is that rice for Nasi Goreng
must be cooked with the least possible quantity of water; this
prevents it from becoming too soft. For 1 cup of rice, use 1 cup of
water. Assuming you have now got your cool, boiled rice, proceed like
this: slice the shallots or onion, seed and slice the chilli (or
pound the shallots and chilli together in a mortar). Heat the oil in
a wok; it makes no difference, by the way, whether you use oil, fat,
or butter. Saute the shallots and chilli for a minute or so, and
season with salt, soya sauce, and tomato ketchup.  Put in all the
rice, and stir it continuously until it is well heated:  this will
take 5 to 8 minutes. Serve in a good large dish, generously garnished
with sliced cucumber, tomatoes, fried onions, and Krupuk.  [Shrimp
