Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables, Indian
Yield: 8 rissoles
Oil; for frying
Breadcrumbs; HOME MADE
4 oz Channa dhal
Salt
1 lb Potatoes; peeled
MMMMM---------------------------SPICES--------------------------------
1/2 ts Ground chillies (cayenne)
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1/2 ts Ground cummin
MMMMM---------------------OPTIONAL ADDITIONS--------------------------
-finely chopped
6 oz Cooked peas; fresh or frozen
2    Fresh green chillies
Soak the channa dhal overnight in enough water to cover. Boil in
twice its volume of water until soft, then strain and mask. add the
spices and salt to taste.

Cook (abt 20 mins) and mash the potatoes in the normal way. Divide the
potato into 8 equal sized lumps, then shape each lump into a "cup"
shape about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter and about 1 1/2 inches high
~ maybe a bit less. Fill each cup with about 1/8th of the dhall
mixture, and enclose in the potato by squeezing in at the top, before
flattening to a conventional rissole shape.

Coat the chaps in breadcrumbs, by rolling them about gently. Press the
crumbs in lightly, so they do not come off when fried. Heat the fat
in a pan to moderatly hot, and add the chaps. Fry one side till
brown, then turn over and fry the other side. Make sure that you have
enough oil to come half way up the chaps - or use a deep fat fryer.
Drain a couple of minutes on kitchen paper. Serve immediately.

Variations. You can add either of the optional ingredients to the
potatoes before shaping to give the chaps a little more interest.
