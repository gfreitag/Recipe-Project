raisins, and lemon peel, then bring to the boil and simmer for 2
minutes. Beat the egg yolks in a bowl and stir into the syrup.  Pour
back into the saucepan and cook, stirring over low heat, without
boiling, until thickened. Stir in the chicken. Pour into a 3-pint
dish and pour the reserved syrup over the top. Chill thoroughly.
If you prefer a fluffier texture, fold in 2 whipped egg whites at
the end, before pouring into the dish."

Henry IV at Westminster on 13 October, 1399.
