-CHOLENT)
The eggs in this Oriental version of this Shabbat dish take on a
marvelous taste, creamy texture, and rich brown color.

(garbanzo beans); soaked overnight 1 lg Onion; sliced 6 ea Raw Eggs

chicken, potatoes, and eggs on top. Add water to cover, plus 1 inch.
Place rice in cheesecloth ++ loose enough for rice to double in
volume ++ and tie securely. Place cheesecloth in pot, mostly below
surface of water. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer
for 1 hour. Place in 225F oven, or cover and cook on a covered
stovetop over very low heat overnight, or cook slowly in a crockpot
over high heat for almost an hour, then over low heat until ready to
be eaten. VARIATION: The Sephardic Jews, especially the Persians,
often stuff the whole chicken before placing it on top of the
ingredients in the pot. Combine 1 cup of raw rice with 1 medium diced
onuion, cut up gizzards if desired, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon
of pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Stuff chicken and sew or skewer
opening together. Place on top of other ingredients with the potatoes
and eggs, cover and cook slowly overnight until lunch the next day.
