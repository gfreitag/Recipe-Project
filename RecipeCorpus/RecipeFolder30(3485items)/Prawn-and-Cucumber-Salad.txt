This salad is particularly pretty as well as good to cat and, being
Thai in origin, is completely oil free and low kilojoules.

Drop 600 g raw prawns into boiling water for about 3 minutes or just
until they turn pink.  Set the saucepan aside and keep the prawns
cool in the liquid.

Peel a cucumber about 350 g in weight and slice it thinly.  Shell the
prawns and halve them lengthwise.  Arrange, prawns and cucumber
decoratively in a serving dish.

Make a dressing by combining 3 finely chopped shallots, 2 tablespoons
lemon juice, 1 tablespoon fish sauce and one small chilli, chopped
finely.

Spoon the dressing over the salad and scatter over the top 2
tablespoons chopped parsley.

Leave flavours to combine for half an hour before serving.

Makes 4 servings.
