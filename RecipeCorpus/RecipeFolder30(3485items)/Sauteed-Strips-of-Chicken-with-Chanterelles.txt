Sauteed Strips of Chicken with Black and Yellow Chanterelles and Red
Wine Sauce

This dish comes from Cahors, a town in the southwest of France known
for its dark, rough red wine.  The sauce is equally good with salmon.

Sprinkle chicken strips with tarragon, salt and pepper, then dust with
flour.

Lightly saute in about half the butter (or butter-oil combination)
until just cooked through (2 or 3 minutes).  Remove from pan and set
aside.

Saute shallots, garlic and mushrooms in remaining butter until lightly
browned, then pour in wine and cook over high heat until reduced to
only a few tablespoons.

Add broth and cook over high heat until this too is reduced by about
half and the liquid is well-flavored.

Add cream, return chicken and accumulated juices to pan, and heat
through briefly.

Serve immediately, garnished with chives if desired.

Serves 3 to 4.
