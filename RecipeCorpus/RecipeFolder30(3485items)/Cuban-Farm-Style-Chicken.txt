This dish features chicken that simmers on the stove until the meat
practically falls off the bones. Organic or free range chickens are
perfect for this recipe, since they are similar to the farm chickens
in Cuba

Wash the chicken, pat it dry with paper towels, and season liberally
with salt and pepper. In a mortar, crush the garlic into a paste with
the cumin and rub the garlic paste into the chicken. Place the
chicken in a nonreactive bowl, pour the orange juice over it, cover,
and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. Remove the chicken
from the marinade, (reserving the marinade) and pat dry. In a heavy
bottomed casserole, heat the oil over medium heat until fragrant,
then brown the chicken on all sides.  Add the reserved marinade, the
sherry, onion and stock, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer
until the chicken is fork tender, 35-45 minutes.  Transfer the
chicken to a serving platter. Strain the sauce through a colander and
return it with the flour to the casserole. Cook the cauce over low
heat, stirring, until it has thickened, 5 6 minutes, correct the
seasonings, pour over the chicken,and garnish with the parsley.
Serves 4.
