Title: Marinated Chinese Hamburgers
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Chinese
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Cornstarch
2 ts Finely minced garlic
2 ts Finely minced fresh ginger
Freshly ground pepper to
-taste
16 oz Lean ground beef
2    Egg whites
22    Scallions, finely chopped
-green and white parts incl.
4 ts Reduced-sodium soy sauce
I used ground turkey in this recipe and next time I make it I won't
use the egg whites.  I think it made them goopier than they needed to
be. I also used green onions instead of scallions.  This was an
interesting recipe--I've never had hamburgers with ginger before and
it was a unique taste!

1.  Preheat an outdoor grill or a broiler until hot (I would suggest
using a cooking spray on the broiler pan--I had fun soaking mine!)

2.  Combine the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, mix with your
hands, and form into 4 patties.

3.  Broil for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until cooked to the desired
degree of doneness.

4.  Serve hot.

The cookbook suggests serving this with Oven-Fried Potatoes, Onions
Baked in Their Skins, and Two-Lettuce Salad with Creamy Horseradish
Dressing.
