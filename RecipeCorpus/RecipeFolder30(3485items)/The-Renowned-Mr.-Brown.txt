The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the rub ingredients
in a small bowl. Massage the pork well with about half the rub. Put
the pork in a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.
Before you begin to barbecue, remove the pork from the
refrigerator and pat down the butt with another coating of rub. Let
the pork sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes.
Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200
degrees F to 220 degrees F.
If you plan to baste the pork, stir any remaining rub together
with the mop ingredients in a saucepan and warm the mixture over low
heat.
Transfer the pork to the smoker and cook it for about 1-1/2 hours
per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 170F to 180F.
Mop the pork about once an hour in a wood-burning pit, or as
appropriate for your style of smoker.
Remove the pork from the smoker and let it sit for about 15
minutes, until cool enough to handle. Pull off chunks of the meat,
and either shred or chop them as you wish. Make sure each serving has
some of the darker, chewier Mr. Brown [outside meat] along with the
lighter interior meat.
