Title: Scrapple or Pawnhaas 2
Categories: Breakfast, Meats
Yield: 1 batch
1 tb Sweet Marjoram
2 tb Pepper
1/2 tb Nutmeg; ground, if desired
1 ts Red Pepper; if desired
2 ts Onion Powder; if desired
8 lb Meat
6 lb Broth
2 lb Cereal
1 ea Bay Leaf; crushed

To make scrapple, cook heads, bones, or any other meat scraps and
water in a heavy pot until meat falls easily from the bones.  Remove
the meat and grind finely.  Strain the broth and return it to the pot
with ground meat. Bring to a boil and slowly add the cereal
thickener, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.  Boil the mixture for
30 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent scorching.  A few minutes
before removing the mixture from the heat season with listed
seasonings.

When the mixture has thickened and begins to leave the sides of the
pot, pour it into loaf pans and chill quickly.  Scrapple may be
frozen for up to 2 months.  To serve, slice and fry quickly, as you
would thick bacon.

NOTE:

Usually the cereal added is cornmeal, but some of the cornmeal may be
replaced with buckwheat flour in a ratio of 2 parts cornmeal to 1 part
buckwheat flour.  A small amount of wheat germ may also replace some
of the cornmeal.
