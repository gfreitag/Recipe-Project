Title: Fondant (Cream Filling for Eggs)
Categories: Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
-OR
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
2 tb Light corn syrup
(From the "Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book.")

Butter the sides of a heavy 1-1/2 quart saucepan. In it, combine
sugar, the water and corn syrup or cream of tartar. Cook and stir
over medium-high heat till sugar dissolves and mixture comes to
boiling. Cover and cook over for 30-35 seconds. Uncover. Cook over
medium-low heat until it reaches 240'F., about 35 minutes, without
stirring (mixture should boil gently over entire surface).

Immediately pour mixture onto a platter. Do not scrape pan. Cool for
45-50 minutes or until candy feels only slightly warm to the touch.
Do not stir candy.

Using a spatula or wooden spoon, scrape candy from edge of platter
toward the center, then beat vigorously about 10 minutes or till
fondant is white and firm. Knead fondant with fingers about 5 minutes
or until smooth and free of lumps. Form into a ball. Let ripen for 24
hours at room temperature. (Ripening is necessary for smooth and
creamy fondant.)

Makes about 3/4 pound.
