I love little meat pies of any description.  In the case of samosas,
they don't even have to have meat in 'em.  Here's a series of seven
recipes from all over the world for "turnovers".

Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of the warm water.  Let stand for
10 minutes until bubbly.  Then stir in remaining warm water 1/3 cup
olive oil, salt and whole-wheat flour.  Mix well.

Stir in 2 cups white flour and as much of the rest as needed to make
a soft dough.  Knead well.  Oil the sides of a large bowl with the
remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Put the dough in the bowl and
turn to coat with oil.  Let rise until doubled, 1 hour.  Punch dough
down and let sit for 10 minutes.

Roll dough into 20 x 24-inch rectangle and cut into 4 x 4-inch
squares. Fill with the salmon-rice or other desired filling.  Fold
over and seal. Trim excess pastry and decorate top of turnover.  Let
rise for 10 minutes. Mix egg and milk (or cream or water) to make an
egg wash and brush it on top of the turnover.  Bake in a 400F oven
for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.

Makes 30 pasties.
