Title: Clam Broth^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Butter
Salt & pepper
6 lg Clams in shell
1 1/2 c  Water
Scrub shells well; put them in a pan with 1 cup of the water. Cook
till shells open; remove clams, chop them and return to the pan with
the water. Cook 10 minutes, strain and add remaining water if
necessary to reduce the strength of the broth. Season, serve. Many of
the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
