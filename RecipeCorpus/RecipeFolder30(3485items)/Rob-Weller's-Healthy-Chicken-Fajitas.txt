1    Red pepper
1    Yellow pepper
1 1/2 lg Red onions
1/2 c  Chopped cilantro leaves
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1 lg Plump chicken breast
1/2 c  Celery (tops and tender,

1/2 md White onion

2 tb Olive oil
MMMMM------------------------BEAN FILLING-----------------------------
Salt to taste
1/4    Onion
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 lb Bag of pinto beans (red or
-pink)
8 c  Water
Poach chicken with celery tops, onions and peppercorns.  Cook for
about 15 minutes.  Let cool and remove skin.  When chicken is
skinned, slice or shred, then saute with olive oil in wok or large
skillet until barely browned around the edges.  Next add red and
yellow peppers and red onions. Toss and saute for about 10 minutes.
Watch closely so that peppers don't go limp.  Add cilantro leaves.
Remove from heat. Add salt and pepper to taste. Combine with beans
(see below). Place in tortillas, top with salsa and serve.

Cook beans in water for approximately 1 1/2 hours on medium heat.

Make sure that beans are completely covered in water.  Stir
occasionally. Beans will absorb liquid and become soft.  Add more
water if needed. Add salt when beans are thoroughly cooked.  Remove
from heat. Add chopped onion.  (Onions will cook from the heat of the
beans.) Drizzle with olive oil.  Let sit.

TORTILLAS: Warm six large flour tortillas in microwave on high (in
large zip lock bag to preserve moisture) for about 30 seconds.

SALSA: Two large, peeled and chopped tomatoes.

Serves 4.
