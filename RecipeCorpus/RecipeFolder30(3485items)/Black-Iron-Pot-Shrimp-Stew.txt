Make a rich, golden brown roux by stirring oil and flour in a large
cast iron  cookpot or skillet over medium heat for 45 to 60 minutes,
adjusting heat as necessary and stirring constantly to prevent
burning. (Roux should be dark peanut butter color. If the flour
should burn, discard and start over.) To this roux, add onions,
scallions and green peppers, reserving about one-third of the
scallions. Saute for 45 minutes, stirring frequently. Do not let
burn. Add worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, tomato sauce,
mushroom soup, tomatoes, salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, sliced
mushrooms, celery, sausage, bay leaves and wine. Simmer about one
hour. Add shrimp, and continue to cook on low heat for 30 minutes.
Keep heat constant and stir frequently. Before serving, add parsley
and reserved scallions. Serve over buttered and fried French bread
slices or fluffy cooked rice, as desired.
