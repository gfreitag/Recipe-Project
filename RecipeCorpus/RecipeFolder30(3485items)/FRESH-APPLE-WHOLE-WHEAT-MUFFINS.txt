Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Grease the muffin pans, or line them with
paper baking cups. Beat the butter, brown sugar and eggs together in a
large mixing bowl until creamy. In another bowl, combine the
whole-wheat flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon, and stir them
together with a fork. Add the combined dry ingredients, the milk,
apple, >> raisins and walnuts to the creamed mixture, and beat with a
spoon until all ingredients are JUST mixed. Spoon the batter into the
muffin pans, filling each cup about 3/4 full. Bake for about 15
minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin
comes out clean. Remove from the oven, and serve warm.
