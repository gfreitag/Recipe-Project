1.  Make a meatless spaghetti sauce.
2.  Boil the noodles for 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain and set them aside to
cool.
3.  Cook the hamburger and sausage, adding whatever spices you like.
Throw the onions in too, near the end of the cooking process.
4.  Drain the meat mixture and throw it into a LARGE mixing bowl.
Let it cool for a little while.
5.  To the cooled meat, add most (about 4/5) of the cheese, the egges
and the bread crumbs.  Add whatever spices you like.  Mix thoroughly.
6.  Carefully stuff the meat/cheese mixture into the noodles.  Set the
stuffed noodles in a large, lightly-greased baking pan.
7.  Cover the noodles with sauce.  Sprinkle some of the cheese on top
of the sauce, cover and bake in a 325 degree oven for about an hour.
Save left-over sauce, if any, to put on the table for those who like
a lot of sauce.
8.  Eat! Eat! You're so thin! Eat!

Sorry about the inexact measurements, but I've been making this dish
(or something very much like this dish) for over 20 years and this is
pretty much what I use.  It never comes out exactly the same way
twice, but I've never had any complaints. <g>

Two stuffed noodles is a "meal" and may cause all but the heartiest of
eaters to explode right there at the dinner table.
