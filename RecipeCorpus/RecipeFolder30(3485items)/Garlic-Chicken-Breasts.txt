Categories: Poultry, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
4    Chicken breast halves, boned
-but not skinned
2 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
1 sm Head of garlic, unpeeled
1/4 c  Chopped fresh Italian

In a small saucepan, place the garlic head in water to cover. Bring
to a boil and drain. Peel the garlic and slice very thinly. In a
small bowl combine the garlic and the parsley. Season with salt and
pepper to taste. Reserve half of the mixture for the sauce. Gently

Stuff each pocket with a quarter of the remaining garlic mixture.
Grill or broil chicken breasts 8-10 minutes on each side or until
springy to the touch. Do not overcook. Heat the butter in a small
skillet and add the remaining garlic mixture. Saute for a few
seconds, add lemon juice, and heat through. Place the chicken on a
warmed platter. Spoon the garlic-parsley sauce over the chicken and
serve.
