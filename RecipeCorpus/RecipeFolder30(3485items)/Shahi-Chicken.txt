Categories: Indian, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Crushed ginger
1/4 ts Red chili powder or cayenne

1/4 ts Coander powder (opt)
1/4 ts Turmeric powder
1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken

1 ts Crushed garlic
Place cashew nuts in small bowl and cover with hot water. Soak 30
minutes and drain most of the water. Blend nuts in blender until they
form a somewhat smooth paste that retains some texture. Heat oil in a
saucepan or wok and saute the onions until golden brown. "Splutter
fry" 1/2 teaspoon of the garam masala powder, and reserve the
remainder to garnish the finished dish. Quickly add garlic, ginger,
red chili powder, coriander powder and turmeric powder to the pan.
Add the chicken and mix well until the meat is sealed with the
spices, about 2 minutes. Mix in tomatoes and simmer until the chicken
is cooked. Then add the cashew paste and cream. Bring to a boil. If
needed, correct the consistency of the dish by adding water. You want
a smooth, slightly thick sauce. Raise heat and "fimmer" dish until
the oil floats on top. Add raisins. Garnish with remaining garam
masala and cardamom powder. Serves 2 as a main dish, 4 if served with
other dishes.
