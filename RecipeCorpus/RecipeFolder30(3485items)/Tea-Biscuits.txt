dough, kneading lightly. Roll out dough about 1/2-inch thick and cut
with a small biscuit cutter. Brush each biscuit with additional
melted butter and put in butter pans. Cover with a tea towel, place

425 F. Bake biscuits 12 to 15 mins or until golden. These are
delicious; serve hot with butter and jam. Yield: about 3 dozen
biscuits.
