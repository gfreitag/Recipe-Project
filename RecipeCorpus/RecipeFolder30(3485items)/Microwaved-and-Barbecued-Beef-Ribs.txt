Here are a few more BBQ recipes I found in a July food supplement.
Scanning sure is great.  I'm finally making progress on my huge pile
of newspapers! I've never used the microwave for cooking ribs, but I
imagine precooking them would serve the same purpose as parboiling
them (which I don't do either...)

Combine ketchup with the vinegar, salt, chili powder, oregano, garlic,
pepper and honey.

Mix well and marinate ribs in the mixture for 20 minutes in a
microwave-safe dish.

Cover with plastic wrap and microwave at full power for 10 minutes.

Remove plastic wrap and turn ribs.

Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for an other 10 minutes.

Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white-hot, or preheat a gas
grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.

Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals.  They will take
about 4 minutes per side.

Serves 4.
