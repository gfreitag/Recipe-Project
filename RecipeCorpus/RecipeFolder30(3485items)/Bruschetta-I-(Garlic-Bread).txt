Title: Bruschetta I (Garlic Bread)
Categories: Breads, Italian, Side dish, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
Olive oil
Salt and pepper
12 sl Bread, homemade or fresh,
-Italian or French loaf
2 cl Garlic, lightly crushed
The best bread for this recipe naturally is home-made bread, but
if this is not available, use fresh-baked bakers' bread or a long
French or Italian stick. Pre-sliced or packaged bread will not do.
Toast the bread in the oven until brown and crisp. Rub at once with
crushed garlic, brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle generously
with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve hot.
