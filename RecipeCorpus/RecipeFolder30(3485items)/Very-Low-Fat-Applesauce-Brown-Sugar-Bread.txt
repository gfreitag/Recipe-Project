Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Walnuts Or Pecans
1 1/2 c  Unsweetened Applesauce
1 lg Egg
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/2 c  Packed Dark Brown Sugar
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
1 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Baking Soda
Heat oven to 350 F. Grease a 8 1/2 X 4 1/2 X 2 3/4-inch loaf pan.

FOOD PROCESSOR METHOD: Put flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking
powder, baking soda, and salt into the bowl of a food processor.
Process a few seconds to mix well. (make sure the brown sugar is
crushed.) Add the nuts and process briefly to chop them fine. Add
applesauce and egg. Process a few seconds to mix well. Spread the
batter in the prepared pan and bake until the bread is lightly
browned and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out almost clean,
45 to 50 mins. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for about 20
mins. Loosen the edges of the bread. Turn it out onto the rack and
turn over. When completely cool, wrap airtight and store at room
temperature several hours or overnight for flavor to develop. BY
HAND: Chop the nuts fine. Place in a large bowl and add the flour,
cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir to mix well.
Beat the egg and brown sugar in a medium-size bowl, mashing up any
lumps of sugar. Beat in the applesauce until well blended. Add to the
flour mixture and stir until well blended. Bake as directed above.
Note: To make a virtually fat-free version, replace the nuts with
raisins or Zante currants (add them at the end so they don't get
chopped up) and the egg with 2 egg whites. YIELD: makes 6 to 8
portion if this is for breakfast; 10 to 12 if a treat with morning
coffee.
