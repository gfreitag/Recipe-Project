Title: Fricassee of Chicken (Low Calorie)
Categories: Poultry, Low cal/fat, Microwave
Yield: 170 servings
1/4 c  Minced leeks
2 tb Chicken stock
3    Bay leaves
1 ts Olive oil
2 tb Minced fresh basil
1 tb Light cream or milk
1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
-breasts, cut
Into 1-inch pieces
3    Plum tomatoes, peeled and
-chopped
2    Cloves garlic, thinly sliced
Place the chicken in a 9-inch glass pie dish and cover with vented
plastic wrap.  Microcook on HIGH until the chicken is cooked through,
about 4 1/2 to 5 minutes, stopping to stir midway. Remove the chicken
with a slotted spoon and drain off any liquid. Combine the tomatoes,
garlic, leeks, stock, bay leaves, and oil in the same dish. Cover
with vented plastic wrap and microcook on HIGH for 2 to 2 1/2
minutes, stirring once midway.

Immediately stir in the basil and cream or milk and let stand for
about 4 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves and serve hot in shallow
bowls.

NOTE:  At this the sauce (everything but the chicken and bay leaves)
can be whirled for a few seconds in a blender before being poured
over the chicken.  This isn't necessary, but it does make a more
attractive, blended sauce.

Makes four servings of 170 calories each.
