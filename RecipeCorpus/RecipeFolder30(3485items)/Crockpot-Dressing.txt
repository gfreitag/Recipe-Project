Title: Crockpot Dressing
Categories: Crockpot, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
2    Eggs, well beaten
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Sage
1 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Marjoram, optional
3 1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 c  Margarine
2 c  Onion, chopped
2 c  Celery, chopped
1/4 c  Parsley sprigs
2 c  Mushrooms, 8 oz., drained
12 c  Bread cubes, slightly dry
1 ts Poultry seasoning
Melt butter in a skillet and saute onion, celery, parsley, and
mushrooms. Pour over bread cubes in a very large mixing bowl. Add all
seasonings and toss well. Pour in enough broth to moisten. Add eggs
and mix well. Pack lightly into Crockpot.  Cover and set to high for
45 minutes then reduce to low to cook for 4 to 8 hours. This recipe
is from the Rival Crock Pot Cookbook.  I have enjoyed this many times
at a friend's house. Using this recipe, I'll bet you can modify your
own to work perfectly in the crockpot. Sure saves oven space in
Thanksgiving!
