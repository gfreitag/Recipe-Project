This dessert can also be made with white wine instead of Marsala;
call it a sabayon instead.  Serve with amaretti biscuits or tuiles.

In heavy saucepan, whisk egg yolks with sugar over low heat until
light and fluffy.  Whisk in Marsala and cook gently, whisking until
mixture has tripled in volume.  Remove from heat and let cool
slightly.  Whip cream; fold into egg mixture.  Spoon into 9x5 inch
loaf pan.  cover with foil and freeze for 5 hours or until firm.

SAUCE: In blender or food processor, puree peaches, amaretto and lemon
juice.  Fold in lemon rind and slivered almonds.

GARNISH:  Cut strawberries through to stem several times, leaving each
berry intact.  Fan out.

TO SERVE:  Spoon sauce onto individual plates.  Place slice of
zabaglione on top.  Decorate with strawberries.
