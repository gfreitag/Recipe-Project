How to Save a Pot of Burnt Rice:

If the rice should scorch while it is cooking, the pot of rice may
still be rescued.  Simply place a dampened cloth or a slice of bread
and I or 2 tablespoons of water over the surface of the rice, cover,
lower the heat to a simmer and cook until rice is tender.  The cloth
or bread will absorb the burnt smell.

[This really does work quite well.  I've done the bread version and it
saved the meal.  S.C.]

Steamed Glutinous Rice:

Glutinous rice may be prepared in the same manner as steamed long-
grain rice by increasing the soaking period to 4 hours and the
cooking time to 35 minutes.

How to Reheat Rice:

Cooked rice may be reheated in several ways.  To reheat by simmering,
place the rice in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.  Then for each
cup of rice, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water over the surface of the
rice, cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is hot.  To
reheat by steaming, place the rice in a heat proof bowl, sieve or
colander and place this with about 2 inches of water in a large pot.
Cover and steam over medium heat for 10 minutes or until heated
through. To reheat in the oven, place rice in heat proof dish or pan
and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water for each cup of rice over the
surface. Place, covered, in a preheated 400F oven for 20 minutes.
