Title: Asopao De Pollo
Categories: Caribbean, Poultry, Meats, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 qt Water
1 tb Capers
1/4 c  Diced pimento-stuffed olives
2 c  Uncooked rice
Garnish:
1 c  Cooked peas
4    Pimentos, julienne
1/2 c  Grated parmesan cheese
1 lb Frying chicken
Salt to taste
1 ts Dried oregano
1    Clove garlic, minced
2 tb Lard
1/3 c  Diced cooked ham
1 md Onion, diced
2 md Tomatoes, diced
1    Green bell pepper, diced
Serves 6 to 8. Wash the chicken and cut it into serving pieces. Mix
the salt, oregano, and garlic together and rub it onto the chicken
pieces.

Heat the lard in a heavy saucepan. Brown the chicken in the lard and
then add the diced ham, onion, tomatoes, and green pepper.

Lower the heat, cover the saucepan, and simmer the mixture for 30
minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat; when the chicken is cool enough to
handle, remove the meat from the bones, and replace it in the pot.

Add the water, capers, and olives and cook for 5 minutes. Add the
rice, stir, and simmer until the rice is tender but still slightly
moist.

Serve at once, garnished with the cooked peas and pimento strips, and
sprinkled with the Parmesan cheese. The asopao must be served
immediately, otherwise it will lose its characteristic soupiness.
