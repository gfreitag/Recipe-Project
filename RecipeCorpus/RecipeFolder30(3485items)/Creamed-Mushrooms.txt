Title: Creamed Mushrooms
Categories: Mushroom, Pastry, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  Madeira*
1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves -
-crumbled
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper, to taste
1 ts Snipped fresh chives
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Minced shallots
2 ts Unbleached all-purpose flour
12 oz Fresh cultivated mushrooms
-- sliced
3/4 c  Whipping cream
1.  Melt the butter in a skillet.  Add the shallots and cook over low
heat for 5 minutes.  Sprinkle the shallots with the flour; then add
the mushrooms, cream, Madeira, and thyme and stir. 2. Simmer the
mushrooms over low heat until the sauce has thickened slightly, 25
minutes. Season with the salt and pepper, garnish with the chives,
and serve.

2 portions.

Author's note:  Lovely on toast or a puff pastry square (or shells).
This is a great first course, or luncheon or supper fare.

*Note from me: If you don't like Madeira or have any on hand, you
could add some liquid from steeping dried imported mushrooms instead,
and throw in the reconstituted mushrooms to make this dish even
richer.  I'd wager you could use yogurt instead of the cream for a
low fat sauce, too. Source: The New Basics Cookbook
