Title: Homestead Breakfast^
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Homemade, Potato
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
Pepper
2 lg Boiled potatoes
6 sl Bacon, chopped
1    Onion, chopped
6    Eggs
Fry bacon until crisp and pour off some of the fat. Add onions and
fry for a few minutes. Dice the potato and add to bacon, fry until
browned. Beat eggs a little, add milk, salt and pepper. Pour over
potato mixture. Cook, stirring often, until eggs are set. Very
filling! Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain
amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in
the book, typos and all.
