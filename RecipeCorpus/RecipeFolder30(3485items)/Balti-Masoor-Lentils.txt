Title: Balti Masoor Lentils
Categories: Side dish, Balti, Indian, Vegetables
Yield: 10 servings
8 tb Fried dehydrated onion flake
2    Garlic cloves, fine chopped
Aromatic salt to taste
18 oz Red lentils (masoor dhal);
-split and polished
4 tb Balti masala paste
There are many small lentils which make excellent dhal. The most
readily available and the fastest to cook is the red lentil in its
split and polished form - available as red egyptian lentil or masoor
dhal.

1 Examine and rinse the lentils as described in Balti Vegetable
cooking information. Soak in cold water for around 30-45 mins. Strain
and rinse.

2 Bring twice the volume of water of the soaked lentils to the boil.

3 Give the lentils a final hot rinse and place them in the boiling
water. Stir after a few minutes to ensure the lentils are not
sticking.

4 Reduce the heat to achieve a gentle simmer. Leave the lentils to
cook for about 30 minutes, stirring from time to time and skimming
off any skum that forms. Keep an eye on the water content. It
_should_ absorb precisely. If it looks too dry, add some water.

5 Add the remaining ingredients, including aromatic salt to taste, and
simmer for a minimum of ten minutes.

6 Serve on its own, or added to other Balti recipes. Freeze any
surplus.
