MMMMM----------------------LAURA MANCHESTER---------------------------
7/8 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Almond extract

Jon's notes: As you know, this is very soothing and refreshing,
especially on a hot summer day.  Also excellent for a sore mouth.
Sometimes Laura makes this in a ring mold, then fills the center with
fresh fruit. Sometimes she makes it in a long pan and cuts the
gelatin into diamond shapes.  She then makes a basket out of a
watermelon, and combines the diamond shaped gelatin with melon balls,
strawberries, fresh pineapple, etc.  Sometimes she puts the diamond
shapes in a punch bowl, and adds fresh fruit and ginger ale.  She
suggests that you reduce the sugar.
