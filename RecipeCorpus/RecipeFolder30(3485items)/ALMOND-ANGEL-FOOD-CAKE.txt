Sifted icing sugar extra
3/4 c  Sifted flour
1 1/2 c  Pure icing sugar
1 c  Egg whites (about 7 eggs)

small bowl. Whisk egg whites in a large copper, steel or glass bowl
until frothy.  Sift cream of tartar over whites, add a pinch of salt,
and whisk to very soft peaks (when bowl is tilted, whites should just
flow and not run or slide out of bowl in a mass).  Sprinkle 2tbsps
sugar over whites, and whisk in gently.  Repeat until all but 2tbsps
of sugar is used.  Sift reserved sugar with flour, then sift 2tbsps
over mixture, and fold in gently.  Repeat until all flour is used.
Sprinkle 2tbsps of ground almonds over mixture, and fold in gently.
Repeat until all almonds are incorporated.  Pour mixture into an
ungreased 20cm angel food ring pan with a removable base. Bake for
50-60 mins, or until golden brown and springy to the touch. Remove
from oven, turn pan upside down, suspend on a bottle or funnel, and
cool cake in pan for 1 hour.  Turn cake right side up, loosen around
edges with a sharp knife or metal spatula and remove gently from the
pan.  Serve sprinkled with extra sifted icing sugar.
