FROM:

The other day, hubby had requested chicken for dinner.  It was still
slightly frozen (boneless chicken breasts) by the time it came to fix
dinner.  Well, I wanted to do something interesting but relatively
low, cal, so I threw this together, and while it might not be real
chicken florentine, it was yummy.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lay the frozen spinach evenly
across the bottom of a small casserole dish.  Mix the yogurt, nutmeg,
salt, pepper, and cornstarch thoroughly, then add chicken and mix
well.  Lay the chicken mixture on top of the spinach, spreading as
evenly as possible, and covering as much of the spinach as you can.
Cover the casserole dish and bake for 40 minutes.  Serves 2.
