* Dried chile pepper flakes are best in a long slow simmered sauce but
bottled hot sauces blend in quicker in this faster version.
My wife, Roslind, makes superior Lasagne to me but unfortunately has
no firm recipes, never measures and won't go near a computer. By
observation, I think this is approximately what she does.

The sauce can be made ahead of time. In a heavy saucepan, combine the
tomatoes, sauce, paste and seasonings. Add salt to taste. [We don't
add extra salt. Start simmering uncovered.

In a large frying pan, heat the oil or grease, add the onion and
garlic and saute until translucent and fragrant. Add the meat [and
salt] and cook until no longer pink. Add to the tomato sauce and
simmer 1 hr.

Prepare the Lasagne in salted water to the "Al Dente" stage. Preheat
oven to 350. In two 13x9 baking dishes, put in a layer of sauce, then
noodles, then cheeses. Repeat two or three times and build up to just
below the brim of the dish. Bake 40 min.
