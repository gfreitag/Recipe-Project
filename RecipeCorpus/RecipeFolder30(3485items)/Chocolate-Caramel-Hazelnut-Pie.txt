Publishing).

Filling preparation: First, prepare the pie shell. Then, in a large,
heavy-bottomed saucepan, stir together the sugar and water. Set the
saucepan over medium-high heat. Let the sugar mixture come to a boil
and continue to cook until it caramelizes. Do not stir the sugar as
it cooks. If it caramelizes unevenly, you can move it around by
swirling it in the pan. When the sugar is a rich golden brown, remove
it from heat and stir in the butter and evaporated milk gradually,
mixing well with a wooden spoon until smooth. Let cool for 5 minutes
and stir in the chocolate. Beat with a whisk until very smooth. Set
the filling aside to cool for 10-15 minutes and then stir in the
nuts. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 475'F.

Assembly and baking: Pour the filling into the pie shell and bake for
10 minutes, until the edge is very brown and the center is bubbling.
Once the pie has cooled to room temperature, about 1 hour, decorate
it, if desired, by making small flowers with the whole hazelnuts and
sliced almonds.

Makes one 9" single-crust pie.
