Title: Grilled Ginger Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/4 c  Rum
1 tb Brown sugar
1/2    Inch piece fresh ginger
-root, finely chopped
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
5 lb Chicken legs
2    To 3 cloves garlic, chopped
-or pressed
2 ts Salt
4 tb Freshly squeezed lime juice
-(about 3 limes)
Rinse the chicken and dry with paper towels.  Rub the chicken with the
garlic and salt; place in a non-metallic dish or a heavy plastic bag.
Combine the remaining ingredients and add to the chicken.  Marinate
in a cool place for at least one hour or refrigerate for up to two
days.

Prepare the grill.  When the coals are medium hot, drain the chicken
and cook over the coals, turning after 10 minutes and basting them
frequently with the marinade, for a total of 30 minutes, or until
they are golden brown.  If the chicken is browning too quickly, move
to a cooler part of the grill.

Serve hot or at room temperature.

Serves six.
