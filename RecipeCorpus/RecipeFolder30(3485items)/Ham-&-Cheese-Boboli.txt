the ham with a layer of mayonnaise. Sprinkle the chopped tomato and
onion over the top of the mayonnaise. Sprinkle with garlic powder to

layer. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and then the cheddar. Bake in

spreading. 2) Before topping the Boboli, brush some egg white around
the edge of the crust and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Submitted By
