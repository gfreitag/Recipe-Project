-to your favorite recipe
Just from the ingredients I would never have guessed this to be a
Mexican recipe.

We thank Angela de Leon Perez for this delightful chicken in cream
sauce. Disjoint the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and saute
in shortening until golden brown and almost done.  Turn once or twice
to brown evenly. When almost done, remove chicken from bones and cut
into chunks.

Prepare a rich white sauce according to your favorite recipe and add
to it 2 well-beaten egg yolks.  Cook noodles according to directions
on package and add white sauce, salt, pepper, grated cheese, and meat
extract, and pour into a buttered ring mold.  Heat in a 350F oven
over a pan of hot water for about 1/2 hour or until mold is firm.

Place chicken pieces in cream and heat, but do not allow the cream to
boil. Unmold the noodles and fill with creamed chicken in the center.
Garnish with watercress.

Makes 4 or 5 servings.
