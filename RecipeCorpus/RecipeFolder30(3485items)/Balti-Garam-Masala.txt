Categories: Herbs/spice, ', Indian, Balti
Yield: 200 servings
1 oz Green cardomom seeds
1/2 oz Cloves
1/4 oz Dried mint leaves
1/16 oz Dry bay leaves
2 1/8 oz Coriander seeds
1 1/2 oz White cummin seeds

To obtain green cardamom seeds, take the pods, and split them open to
reveal the seeds - which is what should be used in this recipe.

Lightly roast everything in a low oven. Do not le the spices burn.
They should only give off a light steam. when they give off an aroma,
remove from the heat, cool and grind in batches.

After grinding, mix thoroughly, and store in an airtight jar. Garam
masala will last almost indefinitely, but it is always better to make
small fresh batches every few months to get the best flavours.
