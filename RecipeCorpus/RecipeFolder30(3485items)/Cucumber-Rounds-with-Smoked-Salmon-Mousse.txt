Combine the mousse ingredients in the bowl of food processor and blend
until the mixture is smooth. Chill at least 30 minutes. Cut each
cucumber crosswise into approximately 20 slices, each slightly less
than 1/4" thick. Cucumbers can also be peeled, striated with fork
tines or cut into decorative shapes with biscuit cutters. Assemble
hor d'oeuvres no more than an hour before serving by softening the
mousse with a wooden spoon and putting it in a pastry bag with a leaf
tip. Pipe mousse on top of each cucumber slice and garnish with a
small watercress leaf.

NOTE: If you prefer, you can slice the cucumbers a bit thicker than
1/4" and make a small hollow for the filling in the center of the
slice with a melon-ball scoop.
