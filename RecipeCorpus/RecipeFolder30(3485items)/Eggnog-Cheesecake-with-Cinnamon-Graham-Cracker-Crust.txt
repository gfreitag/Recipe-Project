mixer until very smooth.  Add dark rum, brandy, vanilla extract and
ground nutmeg and beat to blend.  Reduce speed to low.  Add eggs 1 at
a time, beating after each addition until just blended.  Spoon
filling into crust. Bake until filling is puffed, very light brown
and softly set in center, about 45 minutes.  Transfer cheesecake to
rack and cool 30 minutes. (Center may fall slightly.)  Increase oven
temperature to 400 F.

For Topping:  In medium bowl whisk sour cream, sugar and vanilla
extract to blend.  Pour mixture gently over cheesecake, filling
center depression, and spread evenly to edges.  Bake until set, about
8 minutes.  Transfer cheesecake to rack and cool.  Cover and
refrigerate overnight.

Cut around sides of pan to loosen.  Release pan sides.  Sift ground
cinnamon and nutmeg over cheesecake.  Arrange cinnamon sticks in
center and serve.
