2/3 c  Milk
1/4 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In Dutch oven or cast-iron pot (either having tight covers) melt the
butter.
Dredge the roast with the mixture of flour, cinnamon, and salt, and
thoroughly sear in the heated butter, browning all sides.
Mix basil, rosemary, and thyme. Mix spices with combined dates,
figs, and apples.
Arrange spiced fruits around the meat. Sprinkle sugar or drizzle
honey on fruits.
Carefully pour on beef stock around the edges of the pot so as to
avoid 'flooding' any food surfaces. Cover tightly.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 3 hours, or until tender. Remove from oven
to cool for 30 minutes. Increase oven heat to 450 degrees F.
Prepare a very thick batter by vigorously stirring all batter
ingredients except parsley. Add extra flour if necessary.
Add chopped parsley to the batter.
Pour batter over the roast allowing the excess to trickle down into
the gravy. Return meat to hot oven (450 degrees F) for 5 to 10
minutes so that coating browns nicely.
Cut the roast in its dough jacket. Serve the 'crisps' which formed
in the juices, along with the gravy and fruit.
