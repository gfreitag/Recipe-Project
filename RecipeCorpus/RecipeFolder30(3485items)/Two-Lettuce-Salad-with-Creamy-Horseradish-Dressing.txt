MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1 ts White horseradish
1 ts Capers
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
1 tb Mayonnaise

1 ts Grainy-style Dijon mustard
1.  Tear the lettuce into pieces and place in a salad bowl.

until smooth.

*It is best to use prepared horseradish preserved in vinegar for this
recipe.

Neither I nor my husband (who's a salad freak) were terribly
impressed with this salad.  He looked in the bowl and said, "What's
all this rabbit food?" We usually don't eat salad that's just
lettuce!  Also, they mean what they say about serving immediately.
Erik tried to have some the next day and said that it was very bitter.
