Place the orange juice in a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Reduce
the heat and simmer until it is thick and syrupy, 10-12 minutes. You
should have 1/4 cup syrup. Set it aside. In another saucepan, melt
the butter in a thin stream. Process a few more seconds, until thick.
Serve immediately. Makes 2 cupes; serves 4.
