1 tb Snipped fresh cilantro
1    Broiler-fryer (2 1/2 to 3

Rinse chicken and pat dry.  To make the chicken quarters lie flat on
the grill, break the wing, hip, and drumstick joints and twist the
little wingtips under the back.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and
pepper.

Grill the chicken, bone side up, on an uncovered grill directly over
medium coals for 20 minutes.  Combine the salsa and lime juice.  Turn
the chicken and grill for 15 to 20 minutes until tender and no longer
pink. Brush often with about 1/2 cup of the salsa mixture during the
last 10 to 15 minutes.

For the vegetable sauce, combine the remaining salsa mixture, the
cucumber, green pepper, and cilantro in a small saucepan.  Bring just
to boiling, then remove from heat.  Serve vegetable sauce with the
chicken.

Makes 4 servings.
