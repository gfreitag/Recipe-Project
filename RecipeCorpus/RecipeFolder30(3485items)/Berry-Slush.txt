refreshing dessert.  It's a perfect choice for hot weather dining.

Pour 1/3 cup of the cream into a food processor or blender.  With the
motor running, add the berries, about 1/4 cup at a time, and continue
to process until smoothly blended.  (If you are using a blender, you
may need to add 2 to 4 Tbls more of the cream.)

Stir in the sugar, then spoon the mixture into 4 glasses.  Serve
immediately, or, for a thicker consistency, place in the freezer for
a few minutes.
