the seeds pop, take the skillet off the heat & quickly add the
turmeric, cayenne & tomatoes.  Cover & put the skillet back on the
heat for 1 minute & uncover.  Put in 1 cup water, potatoes, tamarind
& salt. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat & simmer gently for 30

be thick & cling to the potatoes.
