Title: Fig Spooks
Categories: Holiday
Yield: 1 batch
-- stemmed
Soft white butter icing
1 pk Cake mix
-- gold, spice or white
1/2 c  California dried figs
Make cake according to package instructions, folding in figs which
have been cut into small pieces.  Fill cup cake pans 2/3 full.  Bake
25 minutes at 375 F.  To make Spooks, turn cup cakes upside down.
Place a dab of icing in the center, and set whole California dried
fig upright with the stem standing erect at the top.  Let stand until
firm, then ice the whole thin with soft white butter icing.  Let
icing flow around the base of the cake to resemble a sheet.  Mark off
slits for eyes.  Weird-looking; wonderful-tasting!
