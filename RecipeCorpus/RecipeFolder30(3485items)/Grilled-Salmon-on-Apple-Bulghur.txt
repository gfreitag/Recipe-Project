Title: Grilled Salmon on Apple Bulghur
Categories: Herbs/spice, Fish
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  Marsala wine
1 lg Orange
10 oz Salmon fillet
1    Lemon
1/4 ts Salt
Black pepper to taste
1 md Onion, chopped
1 ts Olive oil
4 oz Shiitake or white mushroom
1 lg Apple
1/2 c  Bulghur
1 c  Chicken stock or broth
Chop the whole onion.  Heat nonstick pan large enough to hold all the
ingredients but the salmon until it is very hot.  Reduce heat to
medium-high.  Add oil and saute onion until it begins to soften.

Meanwhile, wash and slice the mushrooms, removing the stems.  Wash,
peel, core and cut apple into quarters; slice quarters thinly.  Add
the mushrooms and apple to the onions and continue sauteing for about
2 minutes longer.

Add the bulghur, stock and wine.  Reduce the heat to simmer; cover,
and continue cooking until the bulghur is soft, about 10 to 15
minutes.

Grate the orange peel.  Prepare the stovetop grill.

Wash, dry and place the salmon fillet skin side down on grill, and
cook salmon according to the Canadian rule: measure at the thickest
part, and allow 8 to 10 minutes to the inch, turning once.

Grate the lemon peel.

When the salmon is cooked, remove the skin and sprinkle grated lemon
over the salmon.  Season bulghur with salt and pepper to taste.
Sprinkle with grated orange peel, and arrange salmon on top of the
bulghur mixture. ** New York Times  //  28 December 1994  **
