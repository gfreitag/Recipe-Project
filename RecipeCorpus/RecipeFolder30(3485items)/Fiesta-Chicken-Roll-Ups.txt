~-- Pound meat into 1/8" thickness.  Halve three chili peppers
lengthwise and remove any seeds.  Place one half of a chili on each
chicken piece.  Fold in sides of chicken and roll up as a jelly roll.
Secure with wooden toothpicks.  Combine 1/4 flour, cornmeal, garlic
powder, red pepper and 1/4 t salt and set aside.  Beat together egg
and 3 T milk.  Roll each chicken roll in flour mixture, dip in egg
mixture and then again in flour mixture. In a skillet, heat 1/4 c
oil.  Cook chicken in hot oil for 10-15 minutes, browning on all
sides.  Transfer chicken to a 12" X 17-1/2" baking dish. Bake in
400Ã¸F oven until tender, approximately 15 minutes. Prepare the sauce
while chicken is in oven.  In a 2 quart saucepan, heat 3 T oil. Add
onion, garlic and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the
undrained tomatos, chicken broth, chili powder, vinegar, crushed red
pepper, cumin, oregano and 1/4 t salt.  Simmer for 20 minutes
uncovered. Transfer chicken to a platter and remove toothpicks.
Combine tomato mixture with 1/2 cup milk and 2 T flour.  Thicken for
1-2 minutes.  To serve, pour sauce over rolls, top with cheese and
olives.
