Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon
pepper.  Dust lightly with flour.

Heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet. Add
the chicken breasts; saute until lightly browned on both sides and
cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the
skillet, cover and keep warm.  Remove and discard the oil and butter
from the skillet.

Heat the remaining butter in the skillet.  Add the mushrooms, red and
green peppers, and the scallions; saute for about 3 minutes until the
vegetables are softened.  Add the sherry; stir to loosen browned bits
from the bottom of the pan.  Add the chicken stock and simmer until
the liquid reduces to 1/4 cup, about 7 minutes.  Mix the cornstarch
and heavy cream together; add to the skillet.  Bring to a boil and
simmer until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.  Return the chicken
breasts to the skillet and simmer them to heat through, about 1
minute.

To serve, place a chicken breast on each warmed dinner plate and
spoon a portion of the sauce over each chicken breast.  Sprinkle with
parsley and serve immediately.

Makes 4 servings.
