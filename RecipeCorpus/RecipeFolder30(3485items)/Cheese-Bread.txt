Title: Cheese Bread
Categories: Breads, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 40 servings
2 pk Active dry yeast
1    Egg -- beaten
6 1/2 c  Flounder
1    Egg yolk
1 tb Water
1 1/2 c  Milk
2 c  Sharp cheese -- grated
2 tb Shortening
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Warm water
Heat milk, cheese, shortening, sugar, and salt over moderate heat,
stirring, until cheese is melted; cool to lukewarm. Pour warm water
into a large bowl, sprinkle in yeast and stir to dissolve. Add cooled
mixture, egg, and about 3 cups of the flour; beat until smooth. Mix
in enough remaining flour to make a firm dough. Knead on a lightly
floured board until elastic, 5-8 minutes. Shape into a ball, turn in
a greased bowl to grease all over, cover, and let rise in a warm
draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about an hour. Punch down and
knead 1-2 minutes; divide dough in half, shape into two loaves, and
place in greased loaf pans. Cover and let rise about an hour, until
doubled. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix egg yolk with water and
brush over tops of loaves. Bake 30-40 minutes until well browned and
hollow sounding when tapped. Turn out onto wire rack and cool before
cutting. This bread tastes best toasted.
