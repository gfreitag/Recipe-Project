Juicy tender racks of baby lamb are ever popular in summer months.
Marinate the lamb in a piquant mixture of Manuka honey, New Zealand
grapefruit and a few cardamom seeds for a really different taste.
Cook the lamb carefully so it's rare and juicy and serve with a
Chardonnay with citrusy aromas or a light red wine.

Mix the oil, grapefruit juice, honey, seasonings and cardamom seeds
together. Place the lamb to marinate in this mixture for around half
an hour, then cook over a low flame on the barbecue, until still pink
but juicy. Carve and serve at once with salads. Serves 6.
