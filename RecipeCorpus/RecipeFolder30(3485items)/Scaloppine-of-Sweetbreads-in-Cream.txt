Categories: Italian, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
Salt and freshly ground
-white pepper
6 sl Of bread, crusts removed,
-sauteed golden brown in
-butter
2 lb Sweetbreads, soaked,
-trimmed, and blanched
Flour
4 tb Butter
1 tb Chopped shallot
1 c  Dry sherry wine
Cut the sweetbreads into 1/2-inch slices, season them with salt and
pepper, and dust lightly with flour.  Heat the butter in a large
frying pan over fairly high heat until the foam subsides and brown
the sweetbreads for about 3 minutes on each side.  Transfer them to a
hot serving platter and keep warm.  Add the shallot to the butter in
the pan, cook until it begins to color, add the sherry, and reduce to
1/2 its quantity. Add the cream and continue cooking until slightly
reduced and thickened. Taste, and correct seasoning.  Arrange a few
pieces of the sweetbreads on each of the slices of toast and spoon a
little of the sauce over each.

Serves 6.
