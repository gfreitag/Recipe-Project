Title: Chicken Breasts with Mushrooms and Marsala (Microwave)
Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Casseroles
Yield: 5 servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
6 oz Fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/4 c  Marsala wine
1/4 c  Beef broth
2 ts Cornstarch
3 tb All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
4    Boneless skinned chicken
-breast halves (5 oz each)
2 tb Unsalted butter, divided
Combine the flour, salt and pepper on a piece of waxed paper. Dredge
the chicken in the flour mixture to coat well.  Heat 1 tablespoon of
the butter and the vegetable oil in a large, heavy skillet over
moderate heat. Add the chicken and brown on both sides.  Drain the
cooked chicken on paper toweling.

Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet.  Saute the
mushrooms over moderately high heat for 3 minutes.  Add the Marsala
wine. Scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the skillet.
Remove from the heat.

Place the chicken in a microwave-safe 12 x 8 x 2-inch baking dish
with the thickest parts toward the outside.  Pour the mushroom-wine
mixture over all.  Cover with waxed paper.  Microcook at 100% power
for 6 to 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked, rotating the
casserole 180 degrees at half time.

Remove the chicken and mushrooms with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Keep
warm. Whisk together the broth and cornstarch in a small bowl until
smooth. Stir into the baking dish liquid.  Microcook, uncovered, at
100% power for 2 to 3 minutes until the sauce thickens and boils,
whisking at half time. Return the chicken and mushrooms to the baking
dish.  Spoon sauce over the top and serve with noodles.

Makes 5 servings.
