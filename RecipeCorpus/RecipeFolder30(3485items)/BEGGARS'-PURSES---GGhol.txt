-(or creme fraiche)
Butter; melted
Chives; blanched
Caviar
Sour cream
COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS for the crepes, except the butter. Whisk well
and pass through a fine strainer. Let rest 1 hour. Add butter before
cooking the crepes. Cook the crepes and be careful not to brown them.
Lay the crepe out on a piece of parchment or a clean towel (don't lay
out more than 12 at a time or they will dry out). Fill with a
spoonful of caviar and sour cream. Pull the edges of the crepes up to
form small purses and tie with a chive. Serve warm or at room
temperature, lightly brushed with butter. These crepes can also be
rolled or folded in the more traditional manner if forming the purses
seems like a daunting task. The result is beautiful, however, and
worth the extra effort.

This elegant recipe comes from Katherine Alford, chief instructor at
the New York Cooking School. Katherine used to be the chef at the
Quilted Giraffe in New York. These crepes are a signature dish of
that restaurant.
