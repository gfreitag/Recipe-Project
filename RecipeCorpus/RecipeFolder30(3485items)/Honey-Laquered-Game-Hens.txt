Here's a new and exciting dish that's easily prepared. It's especially
delicious served with sesame noodles or your favorite rice pilaf. For
an ideal meal without much effort, simply steam up some fresh snow
peas to serve on the side.

1. Rinse game hens and pat dry. Place in a bowl. Trim off wing tips,
necks and any excess fat from the neck cavities.

2. Place garlic and ginger in the bowl of a food processor; process
until nearly smooth. Reserve.

3. In another bowl, combine soy sauce, honey, peanut oil, orange
juice and orange zest. Add the reserved garlic and ginger. Pour
mixture over game hens to coat well.

4. Let rest at room temperature for 4 hours, or refrigerate overnight,
turning game hens in marinade 3 or 4 times.

5. Preheat oven to 350'F. Place game hens in a shallow roasting pan
to fit. Pour marinade on top.

6. Bake game hens 1 hour or until cooked through, basting every 15
minutes.

7. Remove hens to a serving platter. Pour cooking juices into a small,
heavy saucepan and boil over high heat for 5 minutes or until sauce
thickens slightly. Pour over the hens just before serving.

NOTE: These birds can be served whole or, for smaller portions, are
lovely split in half. Just be sure to remove the backbones and wing
tips before preparing.
