Title: Fig Sugar Plums
Categories: Fruit, Candies, Holiday
Yield: 1 recipe
MMMMM----------------------FIG SUGAR PLUMS---------------------------
With your hands, pull California dried figs gently into their original
shape, smoothing out wrinkles and perking up stems.  With a sharp,
small knife, slit the smoothest side of the figs.  Stuff them plump
and full with any of the following goodies:

* half of mint or wintergreen cream patties * half of chocolate
covered mint patties * salted nuts * toasted walnut meats *
marshmallow, slit, with piece of chocolate tucked into it * wedge of
candied ginger * ground nuts mixed with honey * fondant * ground or
chopped salted peanuts mixed with peanut butter * blanched almonds,
dried slowly in oven * candied cherry * chunk of candied pineapple

Arrange these good-to-eat and good-to-look-at figs on pretty tray.
Place candle into a stem-clipped fig, which will serve happily as
candle stick. Conversation piece -- and piÂŠce de resistance!
