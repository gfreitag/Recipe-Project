Title: Sour Cream Fudge
Categories: Candies
Yield: 24 servings
Vanilla*
1 c  Pecans Or Walnuts --
Coarsely chopped
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Sour Cream
1/8 ts Salt
3/4 ts Vanilla Extract Or Cognac
* To make cognac vanilla, take a vanilla bean and carefully split it
lengthwise; then snip into smaller pieces. Place the vanilla bean
pieces into a brown medicine bottle (approx 1 pint) and add a good
quality cognac. Store for 2 weeks before using; shaking gently
periodically during that time. As you use this flavored vanilla, you
may replenish with more cognac finally equalling about 2 or 3 pints.
Then you should discard the beans and start a new batch. This is
especially delicate variation on vanilla extract and once used, you
will never go back to any other type.

1. Combine the sugar, sour cream, and salt in a bowl, and mix until
the sugar is well moistened. Pour the mixture into a heavy saucepan,
and put it on a 'flame-tamer' over medium heat. (Flame-tamers are
merely heat diffusers that will even heat a pot and work both on gas
and electric ranges.) From time to time wipe the crystals from the
sides of the pan with a damp pastry brush.

2. Cook until a candy thermometer reads 236 F, or a tsp of the syrup
dropped into cold water forms a soft ball, about 10 mins. Remove the
pan from the heat. Wipe any crystals again from the sides of the pan
with the damp brush.

3. Cool the fudge to 110 F. Then add the vanilla, and beat with a
wooden spoon until the fudge begins to lose its transparency, 5 mins.
Stir in nuts.

4. Pour the fudge onto a buttered marble slab or a buttered baking
sheet measuring about 12 x 9 inches. Cool completely, then cut into
squares. Store in a airtight tin container. Makes 24 squares.

This white fudge has a pleasing lemony tang to it. Flavor improves if
you let it 'age' overnight.
