Title: Roast Loin of Pork (#18)
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 to 5 serve
1/2 ts Salt
1 ea Boneless loin of pork, tied
. about 2 pounds*
4 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Cracked black pepper
*  Have the butcher bone out a 3 1/2-pound pork loin, trimming,
cracking and saving the bones, to yield a 2-pound boneless roast,
tied. Place the bones in a shallow casserole to act as a "cradle" for
the loin as it roasts.  Otherwise, make a "bed" of celery tops and
sliced carrots.

1.  Heat oven to 325 degrees F.

2.  In a small bowl, stir the soy sauce, sugar, pepper, and salt.
Pour this mixture over the loin and rub it in.

3.  Place the loin, fat side up, on the bones, vegetables (see
above), or on a small rack in a baking dish.  Roast, uncovered, 1
hour and 45 minutes. Add a few tablespoons water if the bottom of the
pan is dry. The pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of
155 degrees F. It will continue cooking after it is removed from the
oven. Remove from the oven when it reaches just under 155 degrees F.

4.  Cover and let stand 5 minutes.

5.  Slice the loin and serve (with the bones if you have them).
