Categories: Appetizers, Indian, Meats, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
Ghee or oil
1    Egg yolk
1/2 c  Chopped fresh coriander
-(cilantro) OR parsley
Fine breadcrumbs (HOME MADE)
1 oz Channa dhall, split
8 oz Fatless stewing steak
1/2 lg Onion; chopped
1    Inch length fresh ginger
Salt to taste
MMMMM---------------------------SPICES--------------------------------
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Garam masala
1    Brown cardamom, ground
1    Bay leaf
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
These are great at barbecues, and as a snack, starter or main course,
amd are familiar friends at the Indian restaurant. You should get
about 8 kebabs from this mix. Serve with salad, lemon wedges and
tandoori chutney.

Soak the dhal overnight, then boil in twice its volume of water.
Strain off any excess water.

Put the meat, onion, peeled and chopped ginger, garlic and spices
through a mincer (grinder). Mix well and add salt to taste. Add the
dhal to the mixture, and fry in a little ghee for 20 minutes. Add a
_little_ water if it dries up too much. Leave aside for about 3 hours
or overnight to thicken and dry.

the next day, or when ready, add the egg yolk, and if it doesn't hold
together, add gram flour to thicken, or water to thin. Add fresh
coriander or parsley.

To make Seekh kebabs, divide mixture into 8, then roll into sausage
shapes in breadcrumbs. Skewer them alongh their length, and cook over
charcoal (best) under the grill, or fry in a frying pan.

To make shami kebabs, roll into balls, coat in breadcrumbs and deep
fry.
