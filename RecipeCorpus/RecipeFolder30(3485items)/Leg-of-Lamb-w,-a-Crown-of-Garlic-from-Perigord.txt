Categories: French, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Sauternes; or
1 c  Montbazillac; or
1 c  Other sweet wine
Salt
Black pepper; freshly
-ground
5 lb Leg of lamb
Salted water
1 1/2 oz Goose fat; or
1 1/2 oz Butter
50    Garlic cloves; peeled
3 tb Armagnac; or
3 tb Brandy
Blanch the lamb by putting it in boiling, salted water for 15 minutes.
Drain the leg and dry it well with absorbent paper or a clean cloth.
Melt the fat in a large, deep casserole. Add the lamb and brown it
all over. Put the garlic cloves around the lamb. Pour over the
Armagnac or brandy and set it alight. When the flames die down, add
the wine and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the
casserole tightly, using foil to make a perfect seal. Cook over very
low heat for 5 or 6 hours, turning the meat over every 2 hours. Serve
the lamb on a large dish with its cooking juices and place the garlic
around it in a circle. This dish is traditionally served with pureed
haricot or broad beans or a dandelion salad.

French name: Gigot Perigourdin a la Couronne d'Ail. This wonderful
dish appears in various parts of France under different names. The
long slow cooking removes any slight bitterness from the garlic and
it becomes a vegetable - tender, golden brown nuts of delicate
flavour. It is a dish for midsummer, when the young garlic is still
tender and juicy, its fat stalks coloured with green and purple
streaks, its skin silky.
