Title: Saltimboca Alla Romana
Categories: Italian, Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
Flour
6 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
12 sl Of veal from the upper leg,
-cut 1/2 inch thick
12    Thin slices prosciutto (fat
-and lean)
24    Fresh sage leaves
Put the veal slices between sheet of wax paper and pound them with
the flat side of a meat cleaver to make them slightly thinner than
they were cut. Season them with salt and pepper, place 2 sage leaves
(dried sage is a poor substitute for this dish, but it may be used if
necessary) and a slice of prosciutto on each slice, fold the slices
in half, secure with toothpicks, and dust with flour.  Melt the
butter in a large frying pan (or use 2 frying pans with slightly more
butter so that all of the veal may be cooked at the same time) over
fairly high heat, add the slices of veal, brown quickly for about 2
minutes on each side, reduce the heat a, and continue cooking for
about 5 minutes, or until the veal is just tender. Do not overcook.
Transfer the veal to a hot serving platter, remove the toothpicks,
and keep warm. De-glaze the pan with the wine, scraping the sides and
bottom with a wooden spoon, reduce by 1/4 and pour over the veal.

Makes 6 servings.
