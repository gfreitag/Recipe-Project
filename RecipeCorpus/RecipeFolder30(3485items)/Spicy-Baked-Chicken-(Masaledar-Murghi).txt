Title: Spicy Baked Chicken (Masaledar Murghi)
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Salt
2    Cloves garlic; mashed
6 tb Lemon juice
1 1/2 kg Chicken pieces
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Ground cumin seeds
1 tb Paprika
1/2 tb Cayenne
1 tb Turmeric
1/2 tb Ground black pepper
Combine the spices, salt, garlic and lemon juice in a bowl. Mix well,
and rub this mixture into the _unskinned_ chicken pieces, pushing the
paste into any flaps & openings and along the bone of the drumsticks.
Spread the chicken pieces in a shallow baking tray, skin side down
and set aside 3 hours (or longer - but cover with cling film to
prevent drying out).

Preheat oven to gas mk 6, 400F 200C. Brush over the chicken pieces
with oil and bake 20 mins. Turn the chicken and bake a further 25
mins (or till tender). Baste 3-4 times with drippings. If a lot of
liquid accumulates in tray, remove extra fat and decant liquid into
pan - boil down until somewhat reduced.

Arrange the chicken pieces on a platter, pour over the sauce and
serve at once.
