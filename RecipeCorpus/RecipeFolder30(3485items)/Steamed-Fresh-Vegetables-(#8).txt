Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
. chunks
3 tb Butter
2 tb (to 3 T) Chopped fresh
. basil, dill, or parsley
2 tb (to 3 T) Chopped scallions
x  Salt and Freshly ground
. black pepper
1/2 lb Thin asparagus (if thick,

2 md Carrots, peeled, cut into
. 2- x 1/4-inch matchsticks*
2 c  Broccoli florets
1 md Yellow squash or zucchini,
. cut into 2- x 2.5-inch
1.  Trim and discard the woody ends from the asparagus.**  Cut into
2-inch lengths.

2.  In a deep covered skillet, heat 1 inch of lightly salted water to
a boil.  Add all the vegetables except the squash.  Return to a boil.
Cover and steam 1 minute; add the squash.  Steam 3 minutes longer,
until vegetables are crisp-tender.  Drain.

3.  Melt the butter in the same skillet.  Return the vegetables and
toss with the basil, dill, or parsley; the scallions; salt; and
freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.

TIPS:  *  To cut matchstick pieces of carrot or other vegetables, peel
carrot.  Cut into 2-inch lengths.  Put each piece on end.  Carefully
slice down, with a chef's knife, into 1/4-inch strips.  Stack a few
strips and cut lengthwise into sticks.

**  Asparagus spears have a natural "breaking" point.  Hold each
uncooked spear with one hand in the middle and the other at the stem
end. Snap the spear.  It will break at the right point.  Discard the
woody end.
