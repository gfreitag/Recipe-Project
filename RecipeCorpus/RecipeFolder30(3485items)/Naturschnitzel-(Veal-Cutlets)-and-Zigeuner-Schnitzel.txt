Title: Naturschnitzel (Veal Cutlets) and Zigeuner Schnitzel
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Aust/german
Yield: 6 servings
4 tb Butter
6 sl Lightly sauteed ham
1 c  To 2 cups Zigeuner sauce
-(see recipe)
2 ea Veal cutlets, each 1/2-inch
-thick and 1-1/2 lbs
Salt
Lightly sifted flour
Trim 2 veal cutlets- each about 1/2 inch thick and weighing 1-1/2
pounds- remove the bones, and cut the meat into 6 serving pieces. Cut
the pieces across the grain of the meat, leaving the little 'nut',
which is divided from the rest of the cutlet by a skin, in a single
piece. Pound each piece lightly: the pieces should be thicker than
Wienerschnitzel or scallopine. Sprinkle the 6 cutlets with salt and
dredge them lightly in sifted flour. Saute them in a large skillet in
4 tablespoons butter for 10 minutes, until they are brown on both
sides. Keep the sauteed cutlets hot in a very slow oven (250 degrees
F) until all are done.

Sauce for Veal Cutlets (Naturschnitzel) DO NOT USE FOR ZIGEUNER
SCHNITZEL

To the juices in the skillet, add 1/2 cup beef or veal stock, 2
tablespoons butter, the juice of 1/2 lemon, and 1/2 teaspoon 'glace de
viande' or meat extract. Bring the sauce to a boil and pour it over
the cutlets. Garnish the platter with lemon wedges and parsley.
Naturschnitzel are best prepared for a small number of people and
served at once, without being kept hot in the oven.

ZIGEUNER SCHNITZEL:
Saute 6 veal cutlets as for Naturschnitzel but do not make the
sauce. Serve them on a platter with alternating slices of lightly
sauteed ham, cut the size of the veal slices. Serve with
Zigeuner-Sauce, gypsy sauce (see recipe).
