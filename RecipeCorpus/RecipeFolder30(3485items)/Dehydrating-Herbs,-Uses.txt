Refer to your herbal referencesfor specific uses, especially if you
are interested in using herbs for healing.  Proceed with caution, but
don't be afraid to learn. Even if you are not yet interested in their
healing properties, remember thatherbs are food, and may be used to
enhance your meals every day.  And,don't forget the simple pleasure
of a fragrant cupful of herb tea....

TEAS are perhaps thecommonest and easiest way to use dried herbs.
There is a whole world of herb teas, strong ones, blandones, minty
ones, tangy, bitter and delicate ones.  Refreshing, soothing ones.
Learn about them. Generally, use a rounded teaspoonful of dried herb
per cup, or more, to taste.  It is not necessary to powder herbs when
using for tea. Pour boiling water over and steep 5 to 15 minutes.
Strain, add a bit of honey to taste.  When using roots or woody
stems, simmer for 10-20 minutes, but never simmer or boil the leaf.
