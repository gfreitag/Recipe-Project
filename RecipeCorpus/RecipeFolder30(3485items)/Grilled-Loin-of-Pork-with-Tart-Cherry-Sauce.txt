Dunno how you feel about NutriSweet and such ilk, but I'm posting a
bunch of stuff from NutriSweets cookbook.  Some of it looks right
good. Tart cherries in a red wine sauce are the perfect complement to
roast pork, while they give a dinnertime favorite new taste appeal.

Lightly sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper; place on rack in
roasting pan.  Insert meat thermometer so tip is in center of meat.
Roast at 325F until thermometer registers 170F, about 2 hours.

Heat the wine, orange juice, shallots, garlic, ginger root, allspice
and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to boiling in medium saucepan; reduce heat to
low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.

Heat to boiling once more.  Mix cornstarch and cold water; stir into
boiling mixture.  Boil, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Stir in
cherries; cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat;
cool for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in NutraSweet Spoonful.  Slice pork
and arrange on platter; serve with Cherry Sauce.

NOTE:  Tart Cherry Sauce is also excellent served with venison or
other game.

Makes 12 servings.
