Pepper
2 c  Lima Beans -- fresh
2 c  Fresh Corn Kernels, Tender

1. Drop the lima beans into a pot of boiling salted water to cover,
and cook at a low boil until almost tender, 18 to 20 mins. Tasting is
the best test. Drain.

2. Combine the corn, lima beans, and 1 1/2 cups of water in a
saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, over medium heat,
shaking pan often, until the corn is tender and water is almost
evaporated, 3 mins. (If the water boils away before vegetables are
tender, add a little more and cook until veggies test done.) Drain,
add the butter, and allow it to melt over vegetables. The succotash
should be creamy. Season with salt and white pepper or cayenne.
