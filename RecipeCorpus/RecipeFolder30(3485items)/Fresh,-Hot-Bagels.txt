Categories: Breads
Yield: 18 servings
MMMMM-----------------------*INGREDIENTS*----------------------------
1 tb Salt
4 c  All-purpose flour (4 to

1 1/2 c  Warm water (105 degrees to

3 tb Sugar
MMMMM------------------------*DIRECTIONS*-----------------------------
Makes 18

Stir yeast into 1-1/2 cups warm water in large bowl; let stand until
bubbly, about 5 minutes. Stir in sugar, salt and enough flour to make
soft dough. Knead dough on lightly floured board until smooth and
elastic, adding remaining flour as necessary.

Let dough stand covered in warm place 15 minutes. Punch down dough;
roll on lightly floured board to rectangle 13x4 inches (about 1-inch
thick). Cut dough into 18 strips with floured knife. Roll each strip
gently to form rope 1/2-inch thick; moisten ends and press together
to form bagels. Place bagels on floured cookie sheets. Let stand
covered 20 minutes.

Heat 1 gallon water to boiling in large saucepan; reduce heat to
medium. Place 3 or 4 bagels in saucepan; simmer uncovered 7 minutes
(no longer). Drain on towel. Repeat with remaining bagels.

Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake bagels on ungreased cookie sheets
until golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on wire rack.

Makes 18 bagels.

Note: To top the bagels with poppy or sesame seeds, remove them from
the oven after 10 minutes of baking. Brush them with 1 egg white
beaten with 1 tablespoon water, sprinkle with seeds. Continue baking
until golden.
