Title: MENNONITE WHITE BREAD
Categories: Breads, Penndutch
Yield: 2 loaves
2 c  ;Water, warm
2 1/2 tb Shortening; melted
6 c  Flour; more as needed to 7 c
1 pk Yeast, dry
1/2 c  ;Water, warm
1/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
Dissolve yeast in the 1/2 cup water. In a large bowl, combine the
sugar, salt, water and shortening.  Add the yeast mixture.  Gradually
add flour to form a soft dough.  Turn dough out onto a floured board
and knead until smooth.  Place dough in a greased bowl; turn to
grease the top. Cover with a clean tea towel and let rise until
doubled, about two hours.

Punch dough down; then divide in half and form loaves.  Place in
previously greased bread pans.  Prick the tops with a fork.  Let rise
until higher than the pans (about two hours).

Bake in a 375 F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes.
Butter the tops of the loaves.  Place pans on their sides until bread
loosens. Remove loaves and cool completely on racks.
