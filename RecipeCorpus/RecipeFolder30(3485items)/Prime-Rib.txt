Title: Prime Rib
Categories: Meats, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
12 lb Standing Rib Roast
Many cooks think there is some special preparation for this popular
restaurant meal but there really is nothing special in preparing
prime rib. Many times your local grocery store will have standing rib
roast on sale at lower prices than ground beef.  Preheat oven to
325øF.  Place the roast on a rack in a 9-1/2" X 13" baking dish with
the fat side up. Insert a meat thermometer into the fat side so the
point of the thermometer is in the middle of the roast and not
touching any bone or large pieces of fat. Bake the roast for 25
minutes per pound or until the meat thermometer reads 165øF.  The
roast will be pink in the middle. That's all there is to making prime
rib.  If you have not tried this wonderful treat at home, I encourage
you to do so.  It tastes even better at home than in the restaurant.
