Title: Foaming Volcano (non-edible)
Categories: Kids
Yield: 6 servings
4 tb Baking soda
This recipe I got many years ago when my kids were still small enough
to enjoy playing in the dirt.  Have the kids build up a big mound of
dirt or sand and then you can mix the stuff up for them.

Warm water

Stir until dissolved in an old coffee can, or soup can for those faint
hearted first timers! 8-}

In a bowl, mix up a combination of 1/4 cup dish soap, 1/4 cup
vinegar, and some red food coloring.

When the kids are all sitting around the big dirt mound, dig a hole
in the top to place the first can that has the water and baking soda.
When you are sure you have their undivided attention, pour in the
vinegar, dish soap and food coloring mixture, and STAND BACK!!  It
will foam up and over and all down the sides, and your kids will be
so impressed with you!!! 8-}
