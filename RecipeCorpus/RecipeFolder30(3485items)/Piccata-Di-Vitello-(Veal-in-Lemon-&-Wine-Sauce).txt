Title: Piccata Di Vitello (Veal in Lemon & Wine Sauce)
Categories: Meats, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2    Lemon, juice of (or more)
Sprigs parsley
1 1/2 lb Veal round, sliced 1/8"
Thick
1/2 c  Flour
6 tb Unsalted butter
This amount of veal usually cuts up into 6 to 10 very thin slices,
some larger than others.  Pound them with a meat pounder to make them
uniform and even more tender.  Flour them by pressing them in the
flour and patting them gently to get as much as possible to adhere.
Melt the butter in a big frying pan over medium heat and add the veal
slices. Turn them the minute their edges whiten, and salt them
lightly. When both sides are done, pour in the wine, and let bubble
until its vapors cease to tingle the nose. Add the juice of 1/2
lemon.  Sometimes 1/2 lemon is too little for that nice tang that
lemon juice should give to this sauce. If more lemon is needed,
squeeze it on, stir, and cook a moment more. Serve with the sprigs of
parsley, which many find adds still a third distinct flavor to the
sauce & meat. From Romagnoli's Table.
