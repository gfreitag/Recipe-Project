make flush with pan rim.

Pour nuts onto a towel and rub lightly to remove salt.  Lift nuts from
towel and put in pastry.

In a bowl, beat to blend eggs, sugar, candied ginger, fresh ginger,
and vanilla.  Pour evenly over nuts.

slightly when pie is gently shaken, about 40 minutes.  Cool on a
rack.  If making ahead, wrap airtight and chill up to a day.  Offer
warm chocolate sauce to spoon onto wedges to taste; accompany with
ice cream.  Makes 9 to 10 servings.
