Title: Veal Marsala with Provolone (Sallie Austin)
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Olive oil
4    Fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/2 c  Marsala wine
4 tb Butter, cold
2 lb Veal cutlets
Flour
Salt & pepper
2 tb Butter
Provolone cheese, sliced

Pound veal cutlets between sheets of waxed paper til about 1/4" thick.
Combine flour and salt & pepper to taste.  Dredge cutlets in the flour
mixture.  Combine butter and olive oil in a large frying pan over
medium high heat.  Cook cutlets until lightly browned, about 2-3
minutes per side. Remove cutlets to a platter or pan suitable for use
under a broiler.

Place mushrooms in the pan and cook until tender, adding a little
butter if needed.  Add Marsala and reduce sauce to about half of the
original volume.

Pre-heat broiler.  Lower heat under the frying pan to VERY low, or
place pan in a larger pan of hot water. Whisk in cold butter, 1 Tbsp
at a time, adding each just before the last is completely
incorporated. Remove sauce from heat immediately when done. Place a
slice of Provolone on each cutlet and broil until cheese bubbles and
just starts to brown. Serve sauce alongside the cutlets, or spoon
over as they are served. (This type of sauce will separate if it
becomes too hot at any point- mine always does :) ).

Other ideas:  Use chicken in place of veal.  Place a slice of
prosciutto on the chicken or veal, then the slice of cheese before
broiling.
