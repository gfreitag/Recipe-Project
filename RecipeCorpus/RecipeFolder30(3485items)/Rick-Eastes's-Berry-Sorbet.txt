Rick Eastes travels to Chile routinely to arrange for shipping that
country's seasonal fruits here. It's summer in Chile now, so his Berry
Sorbet is seasonal, sort of. In it he uses fructose. Not because this
sugar is more easily digested by some people, but because he had some
on the shelf the day he ran out of granulated sugar. If you've run
out of fructose, you can use granulated sugar it its place.

=== 1. In a 2-3 quart pan, combine the 2 cups of blackberries and
raspberries, fructose, water, and lime juice. Bring to a boil over
high heat, stirring often. Then reduce heat and simmer until
blackberries mash redily, 3-4 minutes. Whirl mixture, a portion at a
time, in blender or food processor until smoothly pureed. To remove
seeds, rub puree through a fine strainer into a bowl. 2. Pour puree
into a 9-10" square metal pan. Cover airtight and freeze until firm,
at least 8 hours or up to 2 weeks. 3. Frozen sorbet has an icy
texture. If you like a softer texture, break frozen sorbet into
chunks and beat with a mixer until slushy; serve at once or return to
freezer up to 1 hour. Top servings of sorbet with additional berries
and liqueur to taste (1-2 tablespoons per portion). Makes about 3
cups. Submitted By ROBERT MILES   On   05-09-95
