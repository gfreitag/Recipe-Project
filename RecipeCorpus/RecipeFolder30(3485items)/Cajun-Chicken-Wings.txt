Title: Cajun Chicken Wings
Categories: Appetizers, Poultry, Main dish, Cajun/creol
Yield: 2 servings
2 ts Garlic powder
1 c  Flour
1/2 c  Cajun seasoning
Oil - for frying
2 1/2 lb Chicken wings - separated
-and trimmed
3/4 c  Plain yogurt
2/3 c  Louisiana hot sauce.
A disclaimer.  I've never made these, and I don't really believe that
Cajuns would use yogurt and "Cajun seasoning."  The Cajun seasoning
can be picked up in the same place as the yogurt, at your local
supermarket. The variety of so-called Cajun seasoning is endless, so
is the quality and flavour.

In a bowl, mix together yogurt, hot sauce and garlic.  Add chicken and
marinate overnight in the refrigerator.  The following day, mix
together flour and cajun seasonings in a bowl.  Remove chicken from
the marinade and coat evenly in flour mixture.  In a wok or deep
fryer, heat oil to 370F. This can be achieved by heating over medium
high heat. Use enough oil to cover 4 to 5 chicken wings at a time.
Deep fry wings for approximately 8 minutes.  Drain on paper towel.

Serves 2 to 4
