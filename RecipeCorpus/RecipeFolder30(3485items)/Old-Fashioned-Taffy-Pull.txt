Title: Old-Fashioned Taffy Pull
Categories: Candies
Yield: 90 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
4 ts White vinegar
1. Mix all ingredients except milk in heavy saucepan. Use low heat and
stir often until sugar is completely dissolved. Increase heat and
bring mixture to boiling. VERY slowly add the evaporated milk in a
thin stream so boiling does not stop.

2. Put candy thermometer in place; continue stirring. Cook and stir
constantly until mixture reaches 248 degrees (firm ball stage). Wash
crystals from sides of pan a few times while cooking. To do this use a
pastry brush dipped in water and gently brush downward. When candy has
reached desired temperature, remove from heat, remove thermometer and
WITHOUT scraping sides and bottom of pan, pour mixture onto large
platter which has been greased with margarine.

3. Let mixture cool enough to handle. Grease your hands with
margarine, take a small portion of the candy and begin pulling. Use
only the tips of your fingers to pull. Candy should be white in color
and no longer feel sticky when it has been pulled enough.

4. Twist each pulled strip slightly and place on waxed paper. When
all the candy is pulled, cut each strip into 1-inch pieces. Wrap each
piece in waxed paper and twist ends or get paper especially for this
purpose at a cake decorators' supply store. Store in a container with
a tight fitting cover.

Yield: About 90-95 one-inch pieces.
