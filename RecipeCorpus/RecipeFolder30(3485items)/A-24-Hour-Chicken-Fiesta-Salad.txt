"A layered salad, such as this avocado-topped chicken salad, can
simplify your busy life.  Make it the night before, and the next day
you can come home to dinner waiting in the fridge."  sounds good to
me! ;-)

Place lettuce in the bottom of a large salad bowl.  Layer in the
following order:  cheese, beans, chicken or turkey, tomatoes, jicama,
and, if desired, olives.  Spread Avocado Dressing evenly over the top
of the salad, sealing to the edge of the bowl.  Cover tightly with
plastic wrap.  Chill for 4 to 24 hours. Before serving, sprinkle with
the crushed tortilla chips.  Makes 4 servings.
