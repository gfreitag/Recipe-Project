Title: Chicken Lemonaise
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Soy sauce
NOTE:  All these amounts are
-approximate.  This is a
-very
Forgiving dish.
1    To 2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 ts Cayenne
Juice of 1 lemon
Zest of 1 lemon (remove with
-vegetable peeler)
1/2 ts Tarragon
1 2.5--3 lb chicken, cut up approx. 1-2 tablespoons mustard
(preferably Dijon or dijon-style) 1/2 to 3/4 cup vegetable oil

1.  Put all ingredients except chicken and oil in a blender. 2. In a
slow but steady stream, add the oil.  This will create a sauce with a
mayonaise-like consistency.  (This sauce will keep, so if you have any
leftover, refrigerate it.)

You do not have to add the oil as slowly as you do when you are making
mayonaise, but be gentle with it--use a slow but steady trickle; take
approximately a minute or a minute and 3. Brush the sauce all over
each piece of chicken and marinate 4. Grill or bake until done. The
amount of time the chicken must cook depends on the thickness of the
pieces, whether there are bones in the pieces, etc.  I usually figure
to grill legs and wings about an hour on a slow fire; if the breasts
have been boned, they will need only 20 minutes or so. I sometimes
bake the pieces at 350 deg. or so for an hour.
