Title: Country Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Onion powder
1 tb Paprika
1/4 ts Ground sage
1/4 ts Ground thyme
1/8 ts Baking powder
Oil for frying
3 lb Fryer (or equivalent pieces)
3/4 c  (to 1 cup) buttermilk
Coating:
1 1/2 c  (to 2 cups) flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Garlic powder
Wash and pat dry chicken with paper towel; place in large flat dish.
Pour buttermilk over chicken; cover, and allow to soak at least 1
hour of overnight in refrigerator.  Combine coating ingredients in
double strength paper bag and shake chicken pieces, one at a time, to
coat well. Lay coated chicken pieces on waxed paper for 15 minutes to
allow coating to dry (will cling better).  Meanwhile, pour oil to
depth of 1/2" in electric skillet and heat to 350-360 degrees.  Fry
chicken, several pieces at a time, for about 3 minutes on each side.
Be careful not to overcrowd. Reduce heat to 325 degrees; cook
chicken, turning occasionally, for 25 to 35 minutes or until juices
run clear and chicken is tender. Remove to paper towel-lined platter.
