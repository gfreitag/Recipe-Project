Title: Chocolate dipped Chocolate Biscotti
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 2 servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
4 oz Semi-sweet chocolate,
-chopped
3 lg Eggs
1 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Grated orange peel
4 tb Salad oil
4 tb Sifted cocoa
Method: Using a mixing bowl and an electric mixer fitted with a whip
attachment, whip the eggs, sugar, orange peel, oil and cocoa for 3
minutes on medium speed. Sift the remaining dry ingredients, except
the semi-sweet chocolate. Mix until the ingredients come together in
a firm paste.

Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and on a lightly floured
surface, divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll out into 12-inch
logs. Transfer the rolled dough onto a greased and floured baking
sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the logs are firm to the
touch. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. With a sharp
knife, cut the logs every inch and turn them over on their sides.
Return the biscotti to the oven for the second baking. Bake an
additional 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.

Melt the chocolate slowly in a double boiler. As soon as the
chocolate is melted, remove it from the top of the double boiler to
prevent it from burning. Line a clean baking sheet with parchment
paper. Dip one side of each cooled biscotti and place it
chocolate-side down on the wax paper. Once the chocolate has
hardened, you can store the biscotti in an airtight container. Makes
2 dozen cookies.
