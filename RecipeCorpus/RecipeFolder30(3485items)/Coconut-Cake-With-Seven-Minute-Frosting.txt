Coconut milk can also be bought in cans.

Preheat oven to 350 F. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt
together twice. Beat egg whites until stiff, then add 1/4 cup of the
sugar and set aside. Cream butter until fluffy and add remaining 1
1/2 cups of sugar and the egg yolks, mixing well. Add flour,
alternating with milk and coconut milk, and blend until smooth. Add
vanilla and grated coconut. Last, fold in egg whites. Bake in 3
well-buttered 8-inch cake pans for 30 mins, or until the edges shrink
from the sides of the pans and the cakes are firm to the touch in the
center. Loosen the cakes by running a knife around the edge of the
pans. Turn onto cake racks and cool. When cool, cover with
Seven-Minute Frosting.

Yield: 12 servings.

SEVEN-MINUTE FROSTING: Place egg whites, sugar, cold water, cream of
tartar or corn syrup, and salt in the top of a double boiler. Then
place over rapidly boiling water, beating constantly with an egg
beater, for 7 mins, or until icing will stand in peaks. Remove from
heat, add vanilla, and continue to beat until thick enough to spread.
When entire cake has been frosted, sprinkle coconut generously over
top and sides. Yield: enough for one 9-inch cake.
