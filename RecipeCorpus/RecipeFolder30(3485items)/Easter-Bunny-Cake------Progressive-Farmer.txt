1    Sheet white construction
.  paper  (12x9-inch)
1 pk White cake mix  (18oz)
1 cn Flaked coconut (3oz)

6    Yellow plastic picks
MMMMM----------------------VANILLA FROSTING---------------------------
2 tb Milk
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  Butter or margarine, softend
4 c  Powdered sugar, sifted
Prepare cake mix according to package directions; spoon batter into
two greased and floured 8-inch round cakepans.

Bake according to package directions or until a wooden toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in the pans on wire
racks for 10 minutes.  Remove from the pans, and cool completely on
the wire racks.

Cut one layer in half crosswise forming two half-circles.  (Freeze the
other layer for future use, or make two Easter Bunny Cakes.)

Spread 1/2 cup frosting (see below) on the bottom (flat sides) of one
half-circle; top with second half-circle (flat sides together). Stand
the layers upright on the cut edge on a piece of foil-covered
cardboard or a platter.

Cut to shape a bunny; then shape reserved coconut portion to form a
tail, and attach with frosting.

Spread the remaining frosting on the cake, rounding out the sides;
sprinkle with coconut.  Position the pink jelly beans for eyes and
the red jelly bean for the mouth.  Attach the plastic picks on the
sides of the mouth for whiskers.  Cut out 2 pink and 2 white paper
ears (about 5 1/2 x 1 1/2-inches); trim the pink pieces 1/8-inch
smaller than the white.

Glue the pink pieces to the white pieces; crease the lower half of the
ears, and attach.

**  Vanilla Buttercream Frosting  **

Beat the butter at medium speed with a mixer until creamy; gradually
add the sugar, beating until light and fluffy.  Add the milk and
vanilla, beating until spreading consistency.   Yields about 3 cups.
