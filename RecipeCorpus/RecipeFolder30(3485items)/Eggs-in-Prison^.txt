Title: Eggs in Prison^
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Homemade, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
Stale browned bread crumbs
Seasoning to suit the meat
2 c  Cold cooked meat
4    Eggs
Thoroughly grease four small cups and sprinkle thickly with the bread
crumbs. Season and flavor the meat rather highly, and line the cups
with it, leaving a hollow in the middle. You may want to mix a little
gravy or stock with the meat if it's too dry. Break an egg into each
hollow left for this purpose in each cup. Salt and pepper each
serving and bake in a moderate oven till the eggs are set. Turn out
onto a plate and serve with sauce or gravy if you like.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
