Categories: Poultry

1/2 ts Garlic powder
6    Skinless, boneless chicken
-breast halves
1/2 c  Plain nonfat yogurt
1 ts Chicken boullion powder
1/2 ts Black pepper
Makes 6 servings

In small bowl, whisk together yogurt, boullion, garlic, and pepper.
Blend. Place in a shallow glass dish.  Add the chicken breasts,
turnign to coat all sides with marinade. Cover and refrigerate at
least 2 hours. Remove chicken from dish and discard leftover
marinade. Grill or broil chicken until cooked through, approsimately
5-6 minutes per side.

This is great served with wild rice and a green salad.  I usually
take the chicken skins off before marinating.
