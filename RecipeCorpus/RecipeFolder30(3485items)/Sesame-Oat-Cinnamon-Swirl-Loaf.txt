Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 servings
-sugar
1/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
4 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tb Ground cinnamon
1 1/2 c  Boiling water
1 c  Rolled oats, quick or

1/2 c  Sesame seeds
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water (105-115'F.)
1/2 c  Tightly packed dark brown
In large mixing bowl, combine boiling water and rolled oats. Place
sesame seeds in small fry pan. Toast over medium heat, stirring
frequently, until seeds are golden, 3-5 minutes. Stir seeds into oat
mixture.

In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; add brown sugar, and let
stand 5 minutes until yeast bubbles. Stir in the butter, salt and
cooled oat mixture. Add whole wheat flour and beat in the all-purpose
flour until mixture makes a stiff dough. Let rest 15 minutes.

Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead for 10 minutes, until
smooth and satiny. Wash bowl, grease it, and add dough to bowl; turn
over to grease top. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down and divide in half. Roll each out to make a rectangle
8x12"; sprinkle each half with half the cinnamon. Roll up tightly.
Seal seams and ends. Grease two 8-1/2x4-1/2" loaf pans. Let rise
until doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Heat oven to 375'F. Bake
until loaves are golden and sound hollow when tapped, 30-35 minutes.
Remove immediately from pans. Cool on wire racks.

Makes 2 loaves; serves 24.
