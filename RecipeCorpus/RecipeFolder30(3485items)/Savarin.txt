Title: Savarin
Categories: Breakfast, Cake/cookie
Yield: 10 servings
pn Salt
1/4 c  Corn Oil
1/2 ts Butter Flavor
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/2 c  Raisins, White
1/4 c  Luke-Warm Water
1    Env Dry Yeast
1    Egg -- well-beaten
1/2 c  Skim Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
1 g  Sugar Substitute
MMMMM-------------------------RUM SAUCE------------------------------
1/4 c  Dark Rum
1/4 ts Lemon Extract
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  White Corn Syrup
Stir the yeast into the water and let stand 10 mins. In a large
mixing bowl combine the egg, milk, sugar, sugar substitute, salt,
corn oil, and butter flavor. Stir in the yeast mixture. Beat in the
flour gradually. The batter will be soft. After all the flour is in,
beat about 5 mins, cover, and let rise in a warm place. If placed in
an 85 F place, the dough will double in about 40 mins. After the
dough has risen, work in the raisins with a wooden spoon. Empty the
bowl of batter into a lightly oiled angel food cake pan, cover, and
let stand for 10 to 15 mins, until the batter approximately doubles
in volume. It will rise more quickly in a warm location. Bake in a
pre-heated 375 F oven for 20-25 mins, until the top is golden brown,
and a cake tester comes out clean. Allow to cool, then turn out onto
a plate. Spoon rum sauce over the cake and fill the center with
strawberries before serving. Serves 10 to 12.
