Title: Matt's Honey Curry Chicken Wings
Categories: Poultry, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Turmeric, ground
1/4 ts Cumin, ground
1/4 ts Allspice, ground
1 ts Ginger, ground
2 lg Garlic cloves, pressed
2 tb Sesame seeds, toasted
2 ts Cornstarch
24    Chicken wings (about 4 lbs)
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Honey
1/4 c  Prepared mustard
1/4 c  Orange marmalade
2 tb Red wine vinegar
1 ts Salt
1 tb Curry powder (Madras)
Preheat oven to 350F. Rinse wings well and pat dry with towel. Combine
butter, honey, mustard, marmalade, cumin, turmeric, salt, allspice,
ginger, garlic & curry powder in pyrex bowl. Heat mixture in
microwave to dissolve ingredients, stirring well. Dissolve cornstarch
in vinegar and stir into heated mixture. Dip wings, a few at a time,
into the mixture and then place onto a cookie sheet or open casserole
dish . Bake at 350F for 45 minutes on one side, basting occasionally.
Turn wings over, sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for an
additional 30 minutes, then serve with rice (I drop a 1/4 tsp. of
turmeric into the rice water before cooking).

Note: For variety I will dredge the wings or thighs in a seasoned
flour
mixture and then paint the mixture on with a pastry brush before
baking. Gives the skin a little more "presence".
