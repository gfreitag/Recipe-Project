Title: Summer Pudding
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
3 1/2 oz Caster sugar (4 oz if nec.)
1    Strip lemon rind (optional)
8    To 10 slices day old white
Bread (1/4" thick)
2 1/4 lb Soft red fruit, such as:
-Black and Red Currants
-Blackberries, Raspberries,
-and Bilberries
Pick over and clean the fruit, put into a bowl with sugar to taste
and the lemon rind, if used, and leave overnight. Turn the fruit and
sugar into a pan, discarding the lemon rind, and simmer for 2 - 3
minutes until very lightly cooked. Remove from heat. Cut the crusts
off the bread. Cut a circle from 1 slice to fit the bottom of a 1.25
litre pudding basin. Line the base and sides of the basin with the
bread, leaving no spaces. Fill in any gaps with small pieces of
bread. Fill with the fruit and any juice it has made while cooking.
Cover with bread slices. Place a flat plate and a 1kg weight on top,
and leave overnight, or longer if refrigerated.

Serve turned out, with chilled whipped cream, sweetened if liked.

Note. This 18th century pudding was invented (probably at Bath) for
spa patients on a slimming diet who were not allowed the rich creams
and pastries popular at the time. It was then called Hydropathic
Pudding. Bilberries are traditionally used in the North.
