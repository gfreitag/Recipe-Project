through a fine sieve (or blender). Put aside. Heat the oil in a large
pan and gently saute the garlic, onion, celery, carrot, rosemary and
bacon until they begin to brown. Dilute the tomato paste with a
little warm water, stir it into the pan, then add the cabbage, leeks,
zucchini (courgettes), basil, parsley, and clove, as well as the
pureed and whole beans, and their cooking water. Add a little extra
hot water if needed. Check seasoning. Cook slowly for 30 minutes.
If using rice or noodles, add them to the broth at this point and
cook until tender. Otherwise, serve the thick soup poured over slices
of toast, adding a little extra olive oil.
