Saute half the onion in 1/3 of olive oil over medium heat until
translucent.  Add half the minced garlic and continue to cook until
golden brown.  Add spinach and saute 2 minutes.  Add 1/2 c water,
cover, and cook until water has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Transfer
to bowl and let cool at room temperature.  Repeat this process with
broccoli.
Drizzle about 1 1/2 tsp olive oil on a pizza pan and rub in with a
small piece of paper towel.  Roll out 1 loaf of the bread dough on a
well floured surface, to form a large, thin circle the size of your
pan. (You may have to let this dough rest frequently.)  Place dough
in pan, with edges drooping over rim.  Prick as for a pie shell.
Spread broccoli over half the dough and spinach over other half.
(It doesn't specify which half for each.  I might pick the center for
one and the edges for the other half.  :-)
Scatter dollops of ricotta on top and sprinkle with parmesan and
shredded mozzarella.
Roll out second piece of dough, and place over top, as evenly as
possible.  Press down gently to smooth out lumps.
Take a rolling pin and roll around the sides of the pan, to cut the
edges off the dough and seal the edges.
Brush with egg wash and score with a knife to form an attractive
pattern.
Bake at 400 degrees on lower rack for 20 minutes, or until golden
brown.
Slice and eat.
