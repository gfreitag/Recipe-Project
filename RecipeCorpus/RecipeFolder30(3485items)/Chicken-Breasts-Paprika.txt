Heat butter and cooking oil in heavy skillet. Flour and sprinkle each
chicken breast with paprika. Simmer, slowly, for about 20 to 30
minutes, turning frequently, until tender and browned. Don't
overcook, because chicken meat will become dry and tough. Serve with
warm Roquefort Sauce.

until blended, then slowly, stir in 1 1/2 cups milk. When sauce is
smooth and hot reduce heat and add 8 oz. crumbled Roquefort
cheese.Season with 1/4 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp dry mustard. Stir
sauce until cheese is melted.
