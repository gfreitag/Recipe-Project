Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday

These are traditionally made in mid November and stored in stone
crocks in the

coolest room in the house.  Line crocks with tea towels and cover
with tea towels.  Don't let the rest of the family know where they
are or you won't have any for Christmas!

These are very low calorie and habit forming!  Heh heh.

add condensed milk to make total of 6 cups (Not Eagle Brand!)

5    ea   eggs 2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp cardamom 1/2 tsp anise 2 tsp mace
2 tsp nutmeg 1 Tbs vanilla The above ingredients are imperative to
making these goodies.  The ones below are "icing" on the cake.

1    tsp  baking soda* 1 tsp baking powder* *Omit these two if you use
self-rising flour - regular flour is best.

2    pkg  dry yeast 2 Tbs honey (to keep 'em chewy) Omitted
traditionally - I use it. 14 cups flour (approximately) See
instructions.

Recipe can be cut in smaller portions.  This recipe is an all-day job.
Don't start this at 4:00 p.m. or if you are not feeling extra
energetic. If you have a bad back it mat be wiser to PAY some one to
do this for you.

I have actually kept part of the dough in the refrigerator over night
with no noticeable detriment.

NOTE:  If you use a Kithcen Aid or some other machine with dough
hooks it takes more flour and you need to add more sugar and spices
to keep the flavor savory.

Mix, in a large mixer bowl, all ingredients except flour.  Melt
margarine (if used). Dissolve yeast in warm water and add to other
liquids. This will expand to fill a large mixer bowl to the top.  It
will also taste VERY sweet and rich before you add the flour. The
finished flavor is really very subtle
