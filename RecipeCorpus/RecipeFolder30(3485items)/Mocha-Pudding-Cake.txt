Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 6 servings

-regular or decaffeinated

1 c  Boiling water

1 1/3 c  Granulated sugar, divided

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 350'F.
Coat the baking pan with cooking spray.

In a large bowl, combine 2/3 cup of the sugar, the flour, salt, 1/4
cup of the cocoa, baking powder and cinnamon, and stir well to blend.
Whisk in the oil, milk and vanilla. The batter will be stiff. Scrape
the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.

In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 2/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup
cocoa. Sprinkle evenly over the cake batter. Dissolve the coffee
powder in the boiling water and pour it over the batter. Do not stir.

Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the top of the cake looks
crisp and crackled, and a cake tester inserted in a "cakey" area
comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for about 5 minutes. Serve warm
from this baking pan.
