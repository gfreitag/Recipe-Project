Title: Mutton Broth^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
1    Onion, diced
2 tb Barley
Salt & pepper to taste
1 ts Parsley
2 lb Neck of mutton
2 qt Cold water
1 ts Salt
1 sm Turnip, diced
1    Carrot, diced
Wipe off meat with a damp cloth. Cut meat into small pieces and put
in a small saucepan with water. Let it come slowly to a boil and then
add the salt, which causes any scum to rise. Simmer for one hour,
skimming the scum occasionally. Add vegetables and barley and cook
till the vegetables are very tender. Season to taste; add parsley
just before serving. Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
