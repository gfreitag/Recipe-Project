1 c  Warm milk (105 to 115 degs)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Packed light brown sugar

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 c  Chopped pecans

3 tb Packed light brown sugar

2 ts Ground cinnamon
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1/3 c  Rum
1 1/2 c  Pecan halves
1 c  Packed light brown sugar
1/2 c  Honey
1 c  Unsalted butter, melted
One day before serving: DOUGH: Pour the milk into a large bowl. Stir
in the yeast and 1/2 c brown sugar and let stand 5 minutes. Beat in 2
c of the flour, all the softened butter, the eggs, orange zest, 2 T
cinnamon and the salt until blended. Gradually stir in enough of the
remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Knead on a alightly floured
surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.  Place the dough
in a buttered large bowl and turn to coat the dough with butter.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in the refrigerator overnight.
FILLING: Process 3 T brown sugar, the sugar, 2 t cinnamon and 1 c
chopped pecans in a food processor fitted with a steel blade until
combined but still coarse and crumbly. Add the raisins and process
very briefly to distribute the raisins evenly through the mixture.
Set the filling aside. TOPPING:  Mix the 1 c brown sugar, the honey
and melted butter in a small bowl.  Stir in the rum and pecan halves.
Set the topping aside. ASSEMBLY:  Remove the dough from the
refrigerator and punch down.  Roll the dough on a lightly floured
surface into a large rectangle, about 1/3" thick.  Sprinkle the
filling evenly over the dough and press it into the dough with a
rolling pin. Starting at one long edge, roll up the dough as thightly
as possible like a jelly roll. Lightly butter the sides of a 13 x 9"
baking pan. Spread the topping evenly on the bottom. Cut the dough
crosswise into 3/4" slices and arrange in rows of 3 over the topping,
leaving room for the buns to rise.  You should be able to fit 12 to
14 slices in the pan.  Cover and let rise until doubled, 45 minutes
to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake the buns 25 to 30
minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 minutes.  Invert the
buns onto large platter and serve immediately.  From The Silver
