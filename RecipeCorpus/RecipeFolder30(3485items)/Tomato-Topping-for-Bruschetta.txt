Title: Tomato Topping for Bruschetta
Categories: Italian, Vegetables, Snacks, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 batch
-minced
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
6    Basil leaves, chopped
Salt, pepper and oregano to
-taste
2 lg Tomatoes, chopped
OR
4    Plum tomatoes
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
1 cl Garlic, minced
1    Jalapeno pepper, seeded and
Mix all ingredients in a medium bowl.  Allow to sit for 1-2 hours to
allow flavors to blend.  The oil/vinegar amounts are just guesses.  I
just add about equal amounts until it gets to the right consistency.
Cut Italian or French bagnette into thin slices (about 1/2") and
toast to desired browness.  Top with tomato mixture and eat while
sipping red wine.

IMPORTANT:  Use Balsamic vinegar for best results.  Red or white wine
vinegar can be used in a pinch.  Lacking any of those warrants a trip
to the store.
