Title: Anticucho Style Grilled Fish
Categories: Marinades, Fish, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
5    Peeled garlic cloves
1 ts Cracked black pepper
1    Fistful of fresh cilantro
-(remove the stems)
4    Fish filets, like shark,
-tuna, cod, mahi mahi
2    Pickled jalapenos, plus 2
-Tbsp of the juice
1/4 c  To 1/2 c fresh lime juice
1/4 c  Soy sauce
Combine and blend all ingredients, except fish, in blender until
smooth. Marinate fish for 30-40 minutes. Grill over medium hot coals
until cooked through. Baste with the reserved marinade several times
during cooking. Serve with lime wedges, avocado slices and pico de
gallo.

We have also used this same marinade on boneless, skinless chicken
breasts. We marinate the chicken breasts for a couple hours though,
and then barbeque them like we did the fish.
