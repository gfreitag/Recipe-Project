1. Rinse the chicken wings well and pat them thoroughly dry. Tuck the
end of each wing under the tiny drumstick, so they keep their shape.

2. In a medium-size bowl, mix together the lemon juice, olive oil,
rosemary, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange the chicken
wings in one or two nonreactive ovenproof dishes, so they aren't
crowded. Pour the marinade over them. Turn the wings to coat them
with the marinade, cover the dishes,, and refrigerate overnight or
for at least 8 hours. If possible, turn  the wings once or twice as
they marinate.

3. Preheat oven @400.

4. Bake the chicken wings in the marinade, uncovered, until they are
golden and crisp, turning them once, 30 minutes. Remove them from the
oven and let them cool. Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled.
