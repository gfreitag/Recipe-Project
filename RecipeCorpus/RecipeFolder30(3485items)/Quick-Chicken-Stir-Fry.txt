Servings 2 Original by: John P. Nicholson

Pre-heat non-stick skillet with the tsp of cooking oil.

De-bone, skin and cut up chicken breast halves into 3/4" cubes.

Start the chicken cooking in the skillet, stiring to coat each piece
with oil.  Just before the chicken is white all over, add the above
seasonings.

While chicken is cooking, coarsely slice the 1/2 onion, cut bell
pepper halve into thin strips and halve these slices, add these to
the chicken. Stir frequently.

When the onion and bell pepper are sauted with the chicken, add the
sliced mushrooms and mushroom soup, stir to blend, lower heat and
cover the skillet with lid.

Use the next few minutes to prepare the remaining dishes.  I opened a
can of asparagus tips and put on stove top to warm and fixed a two
person tossed salad.  Total time aprox 20 min.  The taste was out of
this planet. There was enough planned over for another meal by adding
the remaining 3 oz of sliced mushrooms.  Try it you'll like it.
