Title: Shredded Beef Filling for Tacos
Categories: Tex/mexican, Meats
Yield: 10 tacos
2 ts Dried oregano
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Salt
16 oz Solid pack tomatoes
Pureed in blender
3 lb Chuck roast, cut into
2 inch cubes
3 tb Lard or oil
1 md Onion, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
Place meat in a pot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil,
cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours or until very tender. Allow meat to cool
in the broth until easy to handle.

Remove meat and shred by using fingers or two forks.  The meat will
also shred easily in a food processor using the plastic blade.  Place
a few pieces of meat at a time into the container and process
briefly. (Avoid shredding the meat too fine)

Reserve broth for another use.

Heat lard or oil in large skillet.  Add the shredded meat and cook
until lightly browned.  Add onion and garlic and cook until the onion
is soft. Stir in the oregano, cumin and salt.  Slowly add the tomato
puree and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally
until done. If necessary, add small amounts of beef broth or water to
maintain a moist mixture.

Makes enough filling for 10 tacos, burritos, or enchiladas.
