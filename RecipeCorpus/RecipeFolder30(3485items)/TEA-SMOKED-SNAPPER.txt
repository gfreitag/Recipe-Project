Title: TEA SMOKED SNAPPER
Categories: Fish, Main dish, Asian
Yield: 6 servings
6    Cloves garlic, crushed
Marinade:
2 c  Iced water
6 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Ginger juice (see below)
2 tb Salt
1    Luga snapper fillet (about
-1 lb)
6 tb Chinese black tea leaves
6    Star anise
3    Cinnamon sticks
20    Cloves
6 tb Raw rice
Mix the marinade, put in the fish and leave for about 3 hours. Remove
from the marinade, drain, dry with paper towels and set aside. Heat a
wok over a low fire and put in the remaining ingredients. Put the
fish on a wire grill or round bamboo rack inside the wok, at least
5cm above the smoking ingredients. Cover the wok and smoke over a low
fire for 15-20 minutes, until the fish has turned brown and is cooked
through.

Slice and serve either hot or cold with a tangy pickle of Chinese cab-
bage.

Ginger juice: Peel 125 g fresh young ginger, cut into chunks and
place in a food processor. Add 5 tablespoons of water and process
until smooth. Pour contents into a fine sieve or into a piece of
clean, fine cloth. Squeeze to extract the fresh tasting, peppery
ginger juice.
