Thought you might be interested in these two recipes for a birthday
cake. Michael, one of my roommates, just had his big 5-0.  He said he
wanted a mocha cake so I hauled out a couple of fifty year old
cookbooks and put together this cake.  (Well, they were almost 50
years old++one was put out in '46, the other in '50.) The cake++the
first I'd ever made from scratch++turned out great.  It was nice and
moist, if a tad on the heavy side.  The recipe is actually for
cupcakes, but I just made one big layer. The frosting is outstanding,
a definite keeper.

Sift flour, cocoa, soda, baking powder and salt together 3 times.

Cream shortening with sugar until fluffy.  Combine whole egg and egg
yolks, beat well and add to creamed mixture.  Combine coffee and
buttermilk. Add sifted dry ingredients and liquids alternately in
small amounts, beating well after each addition.  Pour into greased
cupcake pans and bake in moderate oven (350F) for 20 minutes.

Makes 18 medium or 12 large cupcakes.

Frost with Fluffy White Icing.  Melt 1 ounce (square) chocolate with 1
teaspoon butter and put a band around each cake with teaspoon or
pastry brush.

MOCHA ICING:

Sift sugar.  Cream butter.  Add sugar.  Beat until smooth.  Add
remaining ingredients.  Beat until well blended.
