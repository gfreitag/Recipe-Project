Title: Casava Bread
Categories: Caribbean, Breads
Yield: 2 rounds
1 pn Salt
3/4 c  Water
1 tb Corn oil
3/4 c  Casava flour
1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
Mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl.  Slowly add the water,
stirring & smoothing the dough as adding.  Stir in the corn oil.  The
dough should hold together well enough to allow it to be rolled out
into a thin disk. Add more water if necessary, but only 1
tablespoonful at a time.

Divide the dough into 2 pieces.  Store one piece in a plastic bag to
prevent it from drying out.  Sprinkle a pastry board with casava
flour & roll the dough out to a 1/4" thick, 6" to 8" irregular circle.

Heat a griddle or heavy frying pan large enough to hold the rolled out
dough.  When hot, brush lightly with oil.  Cook each disk of dough
for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  The surface should be dotted with
brown spots. Cool on a wire rack, but eat before it gets cold or else
it will toughen.

If it goes cold, re-heat in a 350F oven for a crisp casava bread.  If
you like, brush with olive oil & crushed garlic before dropping into
the oven.
