Well, with all the talk about the corned beef and how much salt it
has, I dug out the following recipe that was used on the farm to make
"Corn or Pickled Beef Or Venison."

It is best to cut the meat into 4 to 6 lb pieces.  Have barrel ready
and spread a layer of salt on the bottom.  Rub each piece of meat
wtih a mixture of salt and pepper and pack down in layers, covering
each with a layer of salt.  The top layer should be of salt.  Let
stand overnight.

In the morning pour on the following brine: For 25 lbs of meat: 3 lbs
Salt 1/2 t Saltpeter 1/2 c Brown Sugar, Packed Or Molasses 1/2 t
Baking Soda 2 Gals Water

Dissolve the ingredients in 2 gallons water, stir until salt is
dissolved. Test with an egg; if it floats, fine if not, add more
salt. Pour over the packed, salted meat and if necessary, pour on
more water to cover the meat. Invert a dish over itand put a heavy
weight on it, to be sure that the meat will not float.  It maybe used
in 2 to 3 weeks. For 100 lbs of meat, double all ingredients.
