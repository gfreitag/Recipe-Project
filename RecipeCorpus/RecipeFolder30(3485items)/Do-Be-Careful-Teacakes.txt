Title: Do Be Careful Teacakes
Categories: Irish
Yield: 16 buns
8 tb Sugar
3/4 c  Melted butter
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
4    Eggs, well beaten
1/2 oz Dried yeast
1/2 c  Warm water
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
Preheat the oven to 400'F.

Mix yeast with water and 1 cup flour in a small bowl. Cover with a
clean cloth and leave in a warm place for 10-15 minutes to form a
sponge. Then add the yeast mixture to the rest of the flour, salt and
sugar. Add in the other ingredients, mix well and turn out on a
floured board. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic.

Divide the dough into 16 balls. Place them on baking sheets and leave
in a warm place covered with a damp cloth for 20 minutes to allow
them to rise. Brush with beaten egg before putting them into the
oven. Bake for 20 minutes, until nicely browned.

Eat hot, and do be careful not to drip the butter on your clothes and
not to eat too many, or indigestion will ensue.
