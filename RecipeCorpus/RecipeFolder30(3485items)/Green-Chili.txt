1 lg Onion; coarsely chopped

* cut into 1-inch cubes ** as many as your taste buds will allow ***
optional

Roast the chiles over the flame of a gas stove, or under the broiler,
until charred.  Remove, allow to cool in a paper bag, and peel and
seed. Chop coarsely or cut into strips.  If the peppers are extremely
hot, or if you are faint-hearted, add enough roasted and peeled sweet
peppers to make a total of at least a cup of roasted peppers.

Roll the pork cubes in flour, and brown in the hot olive oil.  Remove
from the pan and set aside.  Add the chopped onion and garlic to the
pan, and cook until the onions are transparent, but not browned. Add
enough flour to the pan to absorb all of the remaining fat, and cook
until the flour is golden brown.  Return the pork to this mixture,
and stir in the chicken stock (you'll want enough stock to cover the
meat).

Add the roasted chiles, cumin and oregano to taste, and simmer until
the pork is tender.

Personally, I like the undisguised flavor of the peppers and pork in
this dish too much to add tomatoes, but if you want tomatoes, add
them as part of the liquid in the dish.  For best flavor, roast the
tomatoes along with the chiles, and peel before adding to the stew.
