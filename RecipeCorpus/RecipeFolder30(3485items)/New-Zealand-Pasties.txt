Title: New Zealand Pasties
Categories: Meats, Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
1 pn Of salt
2 tb To 3 tb water (approx
8 oz Flour
2 oz Crisco
2 oz Butter (or Marg)
Sift the flour and salt. Rub in the Crisco and butter until a sandy
texture is reached. Make a hollow in the middle and add water. Handle
as little and as lightly as possible. Wrap in grease proof paper and
refrigerate for 24 hours. Now it's ready to use for the Cornish
Pasties..

4 oz finely diced RAW potato 4 oz ground beef 2 oz chopped onion 2 oz
finely diced RAW carrots 1 oz green peas (optional)

Roll out pastry to approx 1/8" thick, cut into 5" diameter rounds, I
cut around a dessert dish, moisten the filling with a little water
and place a generous spoonful in the middle of each round. Make sure
it is in a pile not flattened out. Moisten the edges of the pastry
with beaten egg. Fold in half and flute the edges. Now stand them up
so the fluting is a cross the top, and push with your fingers to make
the join into a wavey seam. Boy.. thats hard to try and explain
without being able to show you...Mind you that part is only for
looks! Brush the outside of each pastie with beaten egg, and cook at
275 degrees for 3/4 hr to an hour. When cooked, pastry should be
nicely browned......ENJOY. From: Penny Plant
