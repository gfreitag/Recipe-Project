COUNTRY CREAM GRAVY

1  Tbs margarine 1 Tbs all purpose flour 1/2 cup evaporated skimmed
milk 1/4  cup chicken stock (homemade is best, or use undiluted,
canned chicken broth 1 tsp dry sherry 1/4 tsp ground WHITE pepper 2
Tbs chopped fresh chives.

To make gravy, place margarine in a 4 cup glass measure and microwave
at hight for 30 seconds or until melted. Add flour, stir until smooth.
Gradually add milk, broth and sherry; stir until smooth. Microwave at
high for 3-5 minutes, stirring once. Stir in pepper and chives.
Margarine can also be melted in saucepan on stove. Add flour and stir
over medium flame until margarine is bubbling and smooth. Gradually
add milk, broth and sherry, stirring until smooth and thick. Add
pepper and chives. Serve at once.  NOTE:  I felt the gravy was sort
of bland tasting, so I added it to the pan in which I had cooked the
chicken. It picked up the flavor from the drippings, as well as a
little carmel color. It looked and tasted better than the original
recipe. However, since my husband is a GRAVY FREAK, I made double
recipe of the gravy. He saved the left overs and ate it later, for
breakfast, on biscuits.  His idea, not mine.
