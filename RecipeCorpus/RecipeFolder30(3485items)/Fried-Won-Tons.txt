Categories: Chinese, Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
-chopped
2    Stalks green onions, finely
-chopped
2 sm Eggs, beaten
1/4 ts Pepper

Here are three won ton related recipes++fried won tons, won ton soup
and a dip for the fried won tons.  I have recipes for won ton dough
too, if you want them.  Personally, I find the won ton skins
available in markets to be just fine and a lot less work!

Yield: About 60 to 70.

Shell and devein prawns.  Mince fine.  Stem mushrooms and mince caps.
Mix with prawns, pork, water chestnuts, green onions, half of the
beaten eggs and all of the seasonings.

WRAPPING:

Place won ton squares on working surface so corners face up, down,
left and right.  Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each skin.

Dip a little of the beaten egg onto the bottom corner, bring top
corner to meet bottom corner.  Press to seal.  Moisten left corner
and bring right corner to meet it.  Press to seal.  [This should give
you a little bundle that looks kinda like a nurses hat.  S.C.]

FRYING:

Heat 4 cups oil in wok.  Fry wrapped won ton until golden (about 2
minutes).  Turn over once.  Drain and serve hot.

DO-AHEAD NOTES:

Deep fry won ton, cool and freeze.  To reheat, preheat oven to 350F.

Place frozen won ton onto cookie sheets and heat for 12 to 15 minutes.

COMMENTS:

You may substitute ground turkey for meat in won ton filling.

However since turkey is drier and more bland than pork, add a few more
water chestnuts and 1/4 tsp. monosodium glutamate to enhance flavor
and texture.
