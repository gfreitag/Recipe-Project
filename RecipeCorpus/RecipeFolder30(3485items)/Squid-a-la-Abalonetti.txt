Categories: Seafood

2 lb Squid, cleaned and cut open

1/2 c  Evaporated milk

This recipe is from Abalonetti's, an Italian seafood restaurant on
Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, Ca.  The specialty of the house is to
fix squid so as to be indistinguishable from abalone.  They do a fine
job of it too!  I've gained many pounds from scarfing down their
excellent squid. It's plain, simple, to the point and very, very
good!!! Give this to those folks who say "Eeeauu, I HATE squid!".

Combine milk, egg, salt and pepper.  Dip squid in mixture and roll in
cracker meal.  Place squid in a single layer in hot oil in a 10-inch
frying pan.  Fry at a moderate heat until lightly browned.  Turn
carefully. Cook the other side.  Drain on absorbent paper.  Serve
with lemon wedges.

From "The International Squid Cookbook" by Isaac Cronin, Aris Books,
Berkeley.  1981.  ISBN 0-915572-61-3.

TIP:  Do NOT overcook the squid.  By the time the breading is nice and
golden, the squid should be done...
