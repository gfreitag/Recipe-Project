Title: Basic Egg Noodle Dough
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 pound
4    Eggs
3 c  Sifted flour
Place the flour in a bowl, add the unbeaten eggs and mix with your
hands until the dough can be gathered in a ball. Turn our onto a
smooth surface and knead until all the crumbly particles are worked
in. The dough should be VERY stiff. If necessary work in more flour.
Divide the dough into thirds and one portion at a time roll into a
thin sheet. Let stand a half hour covered with a towel. Cut into
strips or squares the size called for in your recipe. Let dry
thoroughly and store covered until needed.
