This is a hot and tasty variation of the usual vinaigrette that gains
heat the longer it sits.  Any combination of greens will do, as the
dressing turns even an ordinary green salad into something special.

To make the vinaigrette, whisk together in a small bowl or combine in
a jar, cover and shake well.  Allow to sit for 1 hour to blend the
flavors. To make the salad, combine all the ingredients and drizzle
on the dressing. Toss to mix, garnish with the olives, and serve.

Yield: 3/4 cup dressing
