Categories: Thai, Appetizers
Yield: 1 batch
2 tb Light soy sauce
1 ts Salt
3 tb Wheat flour
2 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Sweet corn kernels
1    Egg
1 tb Yellow curry paste
2    To 3 tablespoons rice flour
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/2    Chili, crushed
1/4 c  Peanuts
1/4 c  Cucumber, thinly sliced
4 tb Vinegar
4 tb Water
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
MMMMM---------------------YELLOW CURRY PASTE--------------------------
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1 tb Chopped lemon grass
2 tb Chopped shallots
1 tb Chopped garlic
1 tb Yellow curry powder
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 ts Coriander seeds
8    Dried chilies
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Salt
Mix together the corn, egg, curry paste, rice flour, soy sauce and 1
teaspoon salt.  Shape the mixture with your hands to form circular
cakes about 1 inch in diameter.

Dip the cakes in the wheat flour and then fry immediately in the very
hot oil.  (Do not fry more than 6 to 8 cakes at a time or they will
not cook properly.)

To make the sauce, bring to a boil the vinegar, water sugar, salt and
chili.  Let it cool.

Pound the peanuts and add to the cooled mixture.  Lastly, add the
cucumber.

NOTE:  These little guys are tasty!  Scoop up some of the sauce on
each one and wolf 'em down.  I've used plain curry powder instead of
the yellow curry paste with good results, but here's the recipe for
the paste if you want to go to the effort:

Place the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan without adding any oil.
Dry fry them, stirring, over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until
they are slightly browned, and give off a roasted aroma.

Coarsely chop the chilies and soak in water for 10 minutes.  Drain.
Pound all the ingredients together to produce a fine paste which goes
well with beef and pork.

From the same book.  You can work out your frustrations pounding the
spice mix in a mortar and pestle or you can use a food processor if
you're feeling particularly harmonious...  Make a lot of the paste
and save it for use in other curries.
