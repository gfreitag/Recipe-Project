Categories: Poultry, Dress/stuff

1/4 lb Mushrooms (chopped)
1 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Sage
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
1 c  Buckwheat groats

Kasha is frequently called buckwheat groats.  It is made from
buckwheat grain and then roasted, which gives it a delicious nut-like
flavor. Aside from being a tasty stuffing for poultry, this recipe
makes an excellent side dish in place of rice, potatoes, or noodles.
So if you have any stuffing left over, be sure to refrigerate it and
save for a future meal.

Mix the groats with beaten egg, then add to frying pan over high
heat. Stir constantly until grains separate.  Now add the briskly
boiling water, cover pan, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, fry bacon in another large frying pan.  When bacon is
lightly browned, push to one side and add butter.  Let this sizzle
and add onion, garlic , green pepper, and mushrooms.  Stir well while
they are cooking so that they do not become too brown.  Add oregano,
sage, and salt and pepper. Reduce heat and add the cooked groats. Mix
well, adjust seasoning, and remove from heat.

This is enough for a small roast chicken and more than enough for 2
Cornish game hens.  Increase ingredients for goose.
