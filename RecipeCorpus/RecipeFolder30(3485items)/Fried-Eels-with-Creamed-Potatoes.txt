Skin and clean the eels carefully, cut into 3-inch pieces, sprinkle
with salt and leave for an hour.  Rinse and dry thoroughly, dip in
beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry in plenty of butter.  Serve
with the browned butter and creamed potatoes.

CREAMED POTAYOES:  Melt a tablespoonful of butter, add 1 1/2
tablespoons flour and a little milk.  Stir over a low flame until
thickened; season with salt and a little sugar.  Cut boiled potatoes
in small pieces and add to this sauce.  Serve garnished with chopped
parsley and butter.

When Danish anglers meet to have fried eel, they try to eat so many
that the backbones form a ring around each plate.
