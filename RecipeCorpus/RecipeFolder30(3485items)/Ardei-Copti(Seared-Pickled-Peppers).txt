Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Vinegar
1 x  Peck peppers, red or green
1 x  Salt
Pick large meaty peppers. Wash well and allow to dry. Place peppers
over flame on grill or stove and sear until skins turn black and
pepper is baked. Turn until all sides are blackened. Try not to prick
or break skin while cooking. As peppers are finished place in a
container and cover. When all peppers are done remove the skin. Place
in clean container, salt well and allow to stand overnight. Scald
canning jars, place peppers in jars and cover with a liquid made from
1 part vinegar to 1 part water. The juice left from the salted
peppers should be measured as part of the water content. Process in a
water bath 15 minutes to seal, turn jars capside down while cooling
to ensure seal. When peppers are served a little oil, sugar and more
vinegar can be added to taste. Submitted By MARK MIKLAS   On
