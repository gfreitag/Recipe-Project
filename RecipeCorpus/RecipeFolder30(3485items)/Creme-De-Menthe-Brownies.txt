Title: Creme De Menthe Brownies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 32 servings
1 ts Vanilla
2 tb Creme de menthe
2 tb Milk
2 c  Powdered sugar
6 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
1 c  Unsalted butter -- divided
1 c  Granulated sugar
4    Eggs
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
16 oz Chocolate syrup
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cream 1/2 c of the butter with the sugar.  Add eggs one at a time.
Mix flour and salt in a separate bowl and add to creamed mixture
alternately with the chocolate syrup.  Stir in vanilla.

Pour batter into a 9x13 pan and bake for 25 minutes.  Cool completely.

Mix creme de menthe, 1/4 c of the butter, and the powdered sugar.
Add milk or water until consistency is spreadable.  Spread on cooled
brownies and refrigerate.

When creme de menthe frosting is set, melt chocolate chips and
remaining 1/4 c butter together. Pour onto brownies and spread evenly
over top.

These are very rich, and should be cut into small pieces!
