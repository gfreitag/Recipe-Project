The easiest and, many people think, the best way to prepare squid is
to saute it.  The basic recipe and variations provided here do not
begin to cover the many ways to saute squid.  This dish takes 10
minutes or less to make once you have cleaned the squid.

If you are using garlic, saute it in 1 Tb of olive oil or butter in a
heavy frying pan over low heat until it is lightly browned.  Turn up
to a medium-high flame.  Add the rest of the oil, and when it is hot
the squid, parsley, salt and pepper.  Saute for 3 minutes.

Serve with lemon wedges and boiled or fried potatoes.

VARIATIONS:

1.  Add quartered, cooked artichoke hearts or coarsely sliced beets
along with the squid.

2.  Substitute 1 tsp of dried or fresh dill, or 2 Tbs of fresh basil
for parsley.

3.  Substitute 1 tsp cayenne for black pepper.
