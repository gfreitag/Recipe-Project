Categories: Breads, Snacks, Desserts, Muffins
Yield: 12 servings
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1    Egg
1 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1 tb Cinnamon
1/3 c  Butter or margarine, softend
1/2 c  Raisins, optional
3 1/4 c  All-purpose flour, divided
1 tb Yeast, quick-rise
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Milk
1/4 c  Water
Set aside 1 cup flour. Mix remaining flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a
large bowl. Heat milk, water and 1/4 cup butter to 105-115 F. Stir
liquids into flour mix, stir to blend completely. Add the egg. Add
enough of the reserved flour to make a soft dough that does not stick
to the bowl. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead 5 times. Cover
dough and let rest 10 minutes.

Mix brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together (amounts can be
increased up to 1 1/2 times given for extra sticky buns). Gently roll
dough into a 12"x9" rectangle. Spread with cinnamon mixture and
sprinkle with raisins if desired.

Roll up from long side and pinch to seal the seam. Cut into 12 equal
slices with a sharp knife. Place cut side up in greased muffin tins.
Place muffin pan on a baking sheet on top of a large shallow pan half
filled with boiling water. Cover dough and let rise for 20 minutes.

Bake at 375 F. for 20 minutes or until browned. Remove from muffin
tins immediately to cool. Serve warm!
