Title: Orange Custard Cream Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
1    9-inch pie shell, baked
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
pn Of salt
14 oz Can sweetened condensed milk
4    Eggs, separated
1/2 c  Orange juice
2 tb Orange liqueur
This custard pie is similar in style to key lime pie, but flavored
with orange and topped with meringue rather than whipped cream ++ to
use up the egg whites that otherwise go to waste.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  To make the filling, stir together the
milk, egg yolks, orange juice and orange liqueur.  Pour into the
prepared pie shell and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until just set.
Remove from the oven and turn the heat to 450F.

To make the meringue, combine the egg whites and sugar in a metal
bowl. Set in a pan of simmering water (or place the pan directly over
lowest heat if desired) and stir for a minute or two ++ your clean
index finger is t;he best tool for stirring ++until the sugar has
dissolved and the mixture is warm.  Remove from heat, add the cream
of tartar and salt, and beat until the meringue stand in soft peaks.
Spread over the pie and return to the oven for about 5 minutes, until
golden. Cool to room temperature.
