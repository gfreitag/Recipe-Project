consume quantities.

rice. Melt butter and add to rice.  Beat eggs and grate cheese. Add
milk to eggs, then add cheese, then spinach and mix well, but gently.
Add onion, worcestershire, and seasonings.  Set aside after placing
in a 2 quart casserole.

When ready, set casserole, uncovered, in pan of warm water and bake
at 350 F for 45 minutes.
