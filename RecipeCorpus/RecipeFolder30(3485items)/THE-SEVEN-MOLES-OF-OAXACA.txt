The state of Oaxaca has been called the land of the seven moles, each
one colored by distinctive chiles or, in the case of the green mole,
herbs. They are mole negro (black mole); mole colorado (colored
mole), a deep reddish brown; amarillo (yellow); verde (green);
chichilo (black); coloradito ("little colored"), a bright orangey
red; and mancha manteles (tablecloth strainer), a deep brickish red.
Although these moles used to be made exclusively with dried local
chiles- chilcostle; black, yellow, or red chilhuacle; or a thin
yellow chile similar in shape to a costeno- most cooks have
substituted the cheaper and more readily available guajillos and
anchos. Submitted By EARL SHELSBY   On   05-06-95
