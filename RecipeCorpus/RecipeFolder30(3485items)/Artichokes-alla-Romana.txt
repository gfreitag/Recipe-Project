** "The most superbly prepared artichokes I've ever tasted." Tavola
Calda da Alfredo, New York, NY Slice tops from artichokes. Remove
tough outer leaves and cut off stems to make flat base. Trim off
thorny tips using scissors. Rub cut edges with lemon halves. Drop
artichokes and lemon into lg pot filled with enough boiling salted
water to cover. Cover partially and parboil 10 mins. Remove with
slotted spoon and turn upside down to drain. When cool, gently spread
leaves, remove fibrous chokes from center with spoon. Preheat oven
400F. Combine consomme, oil, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper in
bowl. Place artichokes upright in baking dish and pour consomme
mixture evenly over top. Bake until outer leaves begin to turn copper
color, 25-35 mins. Baste and broil until tops brown, 3 mins. Serve in
soup plates with remaining liquid. S: Fav Rest Rs, Bon A Submitted By
