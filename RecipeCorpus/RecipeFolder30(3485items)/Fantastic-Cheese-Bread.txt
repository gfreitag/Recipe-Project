Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
1/3 c  Skim milk powder
1 c  Cheddar cheese (old, cut in
_1/2 inch cubes and frozen)
7 c  Flour
1 c  Water (warm)
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Cheddar cheese (old, grated)
1 1/2 tb Yeast
1/4 c  Shortening (melted)
1 c  Beer (flat)
2 ts Salt
PROOF In a 2 cup measure, pour 1 cup warm water. Add 1 teaspoon
sugar, but do not stir . Slowly sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons yeast into
the water, making sure each particle gets wet. Again, do not stir.
Wait 10 minutes until the yeast is thick and foamy.

MIX While you are waiting for the yeast to proof add the following
ingredients to your bread bowl, stirring well after each addition: 1
cup flat beer, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup skim
milk powder, 1 cup grated, old cheddar cheese. Then add the yeast and
1 cup of flour, stir. Add 1/4 cup cooled, melted shortening.

ADD FLOUR (slowly) Add the remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, to make a
moderately soft dough. Make sure that the dough is lightly covered
with flour before proceeding.

KNEAD Turn the dough out onto a very lightly floured surface and
knead for 10 minutes. Sprinkle  teaspoon of flour on the bottom of
the dough and whenever it becomes too sticky to work with. Knead
until smooth and elastic.

1ST RISE Place the dough in a greased bowl, turn to grease the top,
cover and allow to rise until double: 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough
down and turn it out onto a clean kneading surface. Knead the frozen
cheese chunks into the dough, then cut dough in half. Shape each into
a smooth ball and allow to rest 10 minutes.

SHAPE When the dough is easy to work with, shape it into a sandwich
loaf. Place into 2 greased pans. (size not noted)

2ND RISE Cover the dough and allow to rise until double: 30 minutes.

BAKE Bake in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. Cool on wire racks.

Note: Place a cookie sheet under the loaves while they bake to catch
any escaped cheese.
