Title: Fig Gems
Categories: Desserts, Candies, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
3 tb Peanut butter
1/2 c  Strained honey
20    California dried figs
1/2 c  Seeded raisins
1 c  Pecan meats
Warm your food grinder.  With medium blade, grind figs, raisins and
nuts. Stir together with sugar and peanut butter.  Add honey to
soften enough to make fruit pliable.  With your hands, make balls the
size of small walnuts, and roll in confectioners' sugar.  Place on a
pretty plate or tray, surround them with figs stuffed with candied
cherries or nut halves, for festive (but fast disappearing)
centerpiece.
