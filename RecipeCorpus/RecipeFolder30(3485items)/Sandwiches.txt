Yield: 2 ideas  CALIFORNIA RANCH FOREMAN SANDWICH: Here's a welcome change for school
lunch -- or for that inevitable mid-afternoon snack. Snip California
dried figs into small pieces, right onto bread richly spread with
peanut butter and broken nut meats. Sprinkle lightly with brown sugar.

TOASTED FIG & CHEESE SANDWICH: Snip California dried figs onto bread
slices.  Lay a slice of mild American cheese on top of the figs. Top
with a fig split in half and dotted generously with butter or
margarine. Broil until cheese begins to melt. Extra good served with
apple and walnut salad, a sweet pickle or two, a hot soup and
favorite beverage. Makes an ideal lunch-at-home for busy homemakers.
