Title: Braised Chicken w/ Tarragon Cream Sauce
Categories: French, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 oz Butter
5 tb Chicken stock
6 tb Double cream
Tarragon; chopped
4 1/2 lb Fat chicken with giblets
Salt
Black pepper; freshly ground
1 bn Fresh tarragon
Season the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper and tuck the
bunch of tarragon in the cavity. Melt the butter in a deep,
flameproof casserole and brown the chicken gently until it is a light
golden colour. Slip the giblets underneath the bird, add the stock
and cover the pan. Simmer on slow heat for 40 minutes, or until the
chicken is cooked. Because of the gentle heat the cooking juices
should be a pale colour, neither brown nor burned. Remove the
tarragon from the chicken and discard it. Leave the chicken for
another few minutes before cutting it up and placing it on a heated
serving dish. Stir the cream into the pan juices, correct the
seasoning, and heat the sauce thoroughly. Pour the sauce through a
strainer over the chicken. Add a small sprinkling of chopped tarragon
and serve very hot.

French name: Poularde braisee a la creme d'estragon. Chicken with
tarragon cream sauce is truly a classic of French cooking. There are
many versions. This recipe is from the Auberge du Pere Bise, on the
shore of Lake Annecy. Because herbs increase in flavour with the sun,
northern tarragon may have to be used in greater quantity to achieve
the same effect. Fresh, not dried, tarragon must be used.
