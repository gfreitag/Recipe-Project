Title: Margarita Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1    Medium lime
Zest of 1 lime
4    Large breasts of chicken
1/2 c  Tequila
1/2 c  Margarita mix
Wash chicken and remove skin from meat. Pierce breasts several
times with a fork and set aside.
Grate the lime peel, using medium sized grater slots. (Grate only
the green part of the lime's peel). Sprinkle the grated peel over the
breasts. Place chicken in a larger bowl, and pour the mixture of
tequila and margarita mix over the chicken; slice and squeeze the
lime over the meat, and place lime slices in the bowl. Allow to
marinate at least one hour.
Remove chicken from marinade, pat dry, and grill over medium heat,
until the chicken is done. Discard marinade prior to grilling. Baste
chicken with fresh tequila and mix if desired.

well).
