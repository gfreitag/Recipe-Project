Title: Mark's Nan Bread
Categories: Indian, Breads, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 nans
1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Vegetable oil
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
2 tb Lemon juice
3/4 c  Warm water
3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 tb Baking yeast
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 ts Salt
In a mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients & mix well.  Add the
garlic cloves, oil, lemon juice & enough water to form a dough. Knead
the dough for several minutes until it is very soft & pliable. Return
to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth & let rise for 2
hours or until doubled in volume.

Turn out dough & punch down.  Divide into 8 equal balls.  Roll each
ball into a tear shape & quite thinly.  You should get a flat bread
of about 6" to 8" in length & 3" wide.  Place on an ungreased cookie
sheet. Cover with a damp cloth & let rest for 15 minutes or so.

While the bread is resting, heat the oven to 500F.  It is necessary
to get the oven really hot.  Set the shelves in the middle of the
oven. Bake each cookie sheet of bread for 5 minutes.  Pull out, flip
over & return to the oven for another 3 minutes.  If you want the
bread a little browner, then leave for another 2 minutes, but watch
them as they will dry out rapidly once they have cooked.

Cool on wire racks, brushing with oil & sprinkling with poppy seeds if
desired.

NOTE: These nans freeze very well.  When using from frozen, I have
best results if I thaw them on wire racks.  Preheat an oven to 350F.
Turn oven off & then pop in the breads until warmed through: they
will only need about 2 minutes to heat through.

They can be reheated very well on a grill come barbeque time as well.
