============================
A SAVOURY PIE FOR PERSONS
-OF DELICATE DIGESTION
Cut up fowl and sweetbread, lay in the dish in alternate layers with
meat, jelly, and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs without the whites,
and flavour with lemon juice, white pepper, and salt; cover with rice
prepared as follows: boil half a pound of rice in sufficient water to
permit it to swell; when tender beat it up to a thick paste with the
yolk of one or two eggs, season with a little salt, and spread it
over the dish thickly. The fowl and sweetbread should have been
previously simmered till half done in a little weak broth; the pie
must be baked in a gentle oven, and if the rice will not brown
sufficiently, finish with a salamander. From: The Jewish Manual by "A
Lady". Intro. by Chaim Raphael Transcribed By: S. Lefkowitz
