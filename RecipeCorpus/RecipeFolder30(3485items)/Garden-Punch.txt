From "The Herb Garden Cookbook" (Gulf, $12.95), by Lucinda Hutson. If
lemon verbena or lemon balm are unavailable, mint may be substituted.

Gently wring the bunches of lemon balm and mint to release the flavor.
Place in a large glass pitcher, cover with the juices and the lemon
slices. Chill overnight, occasionally stirring and pressing down on
the herbs with the back of a wooden spoon. Pour into iced glasses
with a splash of sparkling water or champagne and a sprig of fresh
lemon balm or mint.

Makes about 10 4-oz servings.
