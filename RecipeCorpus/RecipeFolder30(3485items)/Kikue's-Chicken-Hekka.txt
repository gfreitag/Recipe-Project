Chop chicken into bite-size pieces.  You may bone chicken if you
prefer. Melt margarine in wok or iron skillet. Add crushed garlic and
minced ginger.  Stir to obtain flavor. A little oil may be added to
the margarine if skillet is extra large.  Saute chicken until almost
done. Keep stirring and add sliced bamboo shoots. Cook until liquid
practically dries out. Add mushrooms, shoyu and sugar to taste.
Simmer until chicken is tender. Liquid will be scarce. If you are
intending to serve Hekka right away, add beer, stir and simmer for
one or two minutes. Add bean sprouts or watercress and chopped green
onions.  Cover and simmer over very low flame for only 60 to 90
second (the sprouts, watercress and onions should not be soft or
soggy). Service with white rice or brown rice.

NOTE:  Doreen suggest adding bean curd sticks and/or tofu.
