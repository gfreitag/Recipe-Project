Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 10 servings

1 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Quick polenta
Olive oil
1 oz Dried porcini mushrooms

The use of instant polenta in this recipe from Carol Fields' "Italy in
Small Bites," is strictly optional. If you prefer, make it the
traditional way. Just be sure to warm up your stirring arm in advance.

Soak dried mushrooms in warm water to cover at least 45 minutes or
until softened. Remove from liquid carefully and rinse well under
cold running water to remove any sand still clinging. Chop mushrooms
roughly and drain thoroughly. Strain soaking liquid at least twice
through sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels, and reserve for
use in another dish.

Heat olive oil in heavy skillet and saute onion until translucent and
tender, 10-15 minutes. Add garlic and all mushrooms, turn heat to low
and cook, stirring intermittently, for up to 20 minutes, until
tender. Add tomatoes, parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Continue
cooking another 5 minutes.

Cut Quick Polenta into slices 2" wide and 3-4" long and brush lightly
with olive oil to taste. Broil until firm and lightly crisp on both
sides. Place spoonful of hot mushroom sauce on top of each crostino
and serve.
