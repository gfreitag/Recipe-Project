Title: Jan Raymond's Tongue pickles
Categories: Can/preserv, Pickles
Yield: 4 pints
1/2 ts Pepper
1 ts Canning salt
1 1/2 lb Brown sugar
2 c  Vinegar
5 lb *ripe* cucumbers
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Cloves
1 ts Ginger
Peel cukes, remove seeds, and cut into pieces about 2 inches long.
Place in an enamel kettle or pot.  Put spices in a mesh bag or
cheesecloth tied at the top.  Add sugar and vinegar and spicebag to
pot. Cook until cukes are transparent.  Let sit overnight. Reheat,
put pickles in hot, sterilized jars and add liquid, leaving 1/4 inch
headroom. Adjust lids and process in boiling water bath for 10
minutes. My yield was 2 pints, but I suppose that could vary
according to how seedy your cukes are. Good luck! Date: 08-23-94
