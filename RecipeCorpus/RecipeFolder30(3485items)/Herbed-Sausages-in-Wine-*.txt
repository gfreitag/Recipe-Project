medium heat, cook the Italian sausage for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
lightly browned. Drain off the fat.  Add the remaining sausage and
the green onions, and cook for 5 minutes more.  Reduce the heat to
low, add the remaining ingredients, and simmer for 20 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Serve immediately, or keep warm in a chafing
dish. Serve with toothpicks.
