In a large saucepan, combine rutabagas, potatoes and water. Bring to a
boil; cook over low heat 25 minutes or until tender. Drain, reserving
liquid. Mash rutabagas and potatoes until smooth. Butter a shallow,
2-quart casserole dish; set aside. Preheat oven to 300'F. In large
bowl, beat potato mixture on high speed, adding 1/2 cup of cooking
liquid. Beat in flour, bread crumbs, cream, syrup, 1/4 cup melted
butter, eggs, salt, allspice, nutmeg, ginger and white pepper. Beat
until light and fluffy. Spoon into prepared casserole dish. Use a
spoon to smooth top. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons melted butter. Bake,
uncovered, 1.5-2 hours or until lightly browned.
