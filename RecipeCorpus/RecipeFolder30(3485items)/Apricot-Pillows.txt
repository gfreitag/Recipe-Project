Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 20 servings
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 c  Firmly packed dried apricots

From "375 Great Cookies & Brownies," by Joanne Lamb Hayes and Bonnie
Tandy Leblang (HarperCollins, 1993, $16.95).

In medium bowl, beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium
speed until well blended. Beat in egg and almond extract until light
and fluffy.

Mix together flour, baking powder, salt and add, beat on low speed
until dough is smooth, scraping down sides of bowl frequently with a
rubber spatula. Wrap dough and refrigerate 2-3 hours, until firm.

Meanwhile, finely chop dried apricots. In a small bowl stir together
apricots and honey. Set apricot filling aside at room temperature
until dough has chilled.

Heat oven to 350'F. Between pieces of waxed paper, roll out dough 1/8"
thick. Cut out cookies with 2" round cutter. Reroll scraps to make
additional cookies.

Place half of cookies 2" apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Spoon
about 1/2 teaspoon apricot filling into center of cookies. Moisten
edges of cookies with water and top with remaining cookies to make a
sandwich. Press edges together with fingertips to seal. Pierce center
of each "pillow" with tines of fork.

Bake 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown. Let cookies cool
2 minutes on sheets, then remove to racks and cool completely. Store
in a tightly covered container. Makes about 20 cookies.
