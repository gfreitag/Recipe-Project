heat, stir fry for about 10 minutes, allowing the onion to become
translucent and begin to brown. Add the masala paste and the duck.
Raise the heat again and bring to a brisk sizzle, stir-frying as
needed for about 5 minutes.
Add the tomatoes, tangerine segments and mint. Add the stock or
water, bit by bit, and simmer, stirring, on a lower heat for about 20
minutes.
Test that the duck is cooked right through by cutting into one of
the pieces. When cooked as you like it, add the garam masala, fresh
coriander and aromatic salt to taste.  Simmer 5 minutes before
serving.

NB. You can substitute any poultry or game meats or joints for the
duck in the recipe.
