Title: Hazelnut Praline
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 .5 cups
1 ts Vanilla
1 tb Unsalted butter
1 1/2 c  Hazelnuts
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Water
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Toast the hazelnuts on a baking sheet
for 7 to 10 minutes.  Rub the nuts against each other in a kitchen
towel to remove the skins.  Slowly heat the sugar and water in a
heavy medium size saucepan to boiling.  Then boil rapidly for 2 to 3
minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.  Remove from
heat, add the nuts, and stir until evenly coated with syrup.  The
sugar will start to crystallize. Return to medium heat to melt the
sugar again and caramelize the nuts. Cook, stirring constantly with a
wooden spoon, until the nuts begin to color.  Stir in the vanilla.
(If the mixture begins to smoke, remove it immediately from the heat.
Allow it to cool slightly before continuing.) Continue to cook and
stir until the nuts turn a nice golden color. Remove from heat and
stir in the butter. Spread the praline mixture on a oiled piece of
aluminum foil and let stand until completely cooled. Break the cooled
praline into pieces and process in a food processor fitted with a
steel blade until coarsely chopped.  Store the praline in an airtight
container.  From The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook by Julee Russo
