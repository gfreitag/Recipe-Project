Lay the chicken quarters in a large glass or pottery baking dish.

in the refrigerator, turning the pieces occasionally, for several
hours or overnight.

Preheat the broiler. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving
the marinade. Broil, skin side down, 7 to 8" from the heat for about
30 minutes. Turn and brush with the marinade. Broil until tender, 15
to 30 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large skillet. Add the onions
and pine nuts. Saute over medium heat until the onions are light
yellow and the pine nuts are golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Spoon
some of the onions and nut mixture on the tops of the pitas. Top each
with a broiled chicken quarter.

Makes 8 servings.
