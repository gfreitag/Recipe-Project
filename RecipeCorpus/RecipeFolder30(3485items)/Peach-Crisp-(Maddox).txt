Title: Peach Crisp (Maddox)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter, softened
6 c  Peeled, sliced fresh peaches
1 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 c  Sugar
All this talk about peaches caused me to look up one of my favorite
childhood memories.  My mom used to make this peach crisp.  The
recipe says it makes six servings, but don't count on it!

Place peaches in a lightly-greased 8-inch square baking dish; set
aside.

Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a medium mixing bowl; cut
in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.
Sprinkle mixture evenly over peaches in prepared dish.  Bake at 375F
for 45 minutes or until golden brown.  Spoon into individual serving
bowls; serve warm with whipped cream.
