Title: Moist Barbecue Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
Bed Of Medium Hot Coals
1    Cut Up Chicken
Favorite Barbecue Sauce
As in my holiday turkey, I like to have my barbecued chicken moist and
juicy. This is more of a technique than any special recipe.  Place
chicken pieces on the grill.  Cook for 2 minutes and turn over.
Baste each piece with sauce.  Cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Turn and
baste.  Keep turning and basting at 3-4 minute intervals until
chicken is done.  By turning at frequent intervals the sauce doesn't
have time to burn.  If there is anything special about the technique
it is the frequent turning and the bed of medium hot coals.  From:
