Even if you don't live in tornado country, the dramatic and
unpredictable nature of twisters commands the respect of all people.
The image of Dorothy being swept away to the land of Oz by a tornado
in Kansas lives in our memories and imagination.  Here's a safe
version of this fascinating force of nature you can create at home or
camp.

Fill the jar with water to 1" from the rim.  Add 3-4 drops of food
coloring (which is optional) and 1 teaspoon detergent.  Screw the lid
tightly to the jar.  Hold the jar horizontally in front of you with
hands on both ends. Shake the bottle straight out in front of you in
a smooth, rapid, circular motion about 10 times.  Immediately turn
the bottle upright. A tornado will emerge and twist around for about
8 seconds. It's amazing! Let the water settle and repeat.  Talk about
the damage tornadoes can cause and also review safety steps you
should take if a tornado is sighted.
