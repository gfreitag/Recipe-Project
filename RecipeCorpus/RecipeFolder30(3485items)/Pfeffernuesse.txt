PFEFFERNUESSE

Beat the eggs and brown sugar until light and thick. Add the lemon
rind. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and spices. Add
alternately with coffee. Stir in the citron. Chill the dough for 2
hours. Form into rolls 1 inch in diameter, and cut each roll into 1/2
inch pieces. Arrange, a little apart, on greased cookie tins and let
stand in a cool place overnight. Next morning, turn each cookie over
and put a drop of apricot brandy on each. Bake at once for 20 minutes
at 300F. While still hot, roll in confectioners' sugar. This makes
about 65. Pfeffernuesse become hard very quickly, so if not used at
once, they should be frozen.
