This one looks a tad odd.  Any adventurous pasta eaters out there?

Fragrant fresh ginger, flakes of hot red pepper and a hefty jolt of
garlic season this pasta dish.

Boil spaghetti until al dente.

Meanwhile, heat garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes in olive oil,
cooking until garlic becomes golden around the edges.  Do not let it
brown!

Drain spaghetti.  Remove ginger slices and toss spaghetti with
garlic/red pepper mixture; season with salt to taste.

Toss with basil and mint; serve immediately.
