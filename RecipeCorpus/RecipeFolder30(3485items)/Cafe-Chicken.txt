8 Source: The Crockery Pot Cookbook NOTE: Since this is a French
recipe from Paris, try to serve this with a crusty French bread, and
a little pot of sweet butter. A carafe of white wine is also a nice
addition.

Note from Gaye:  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and the
recipe was delicious!
