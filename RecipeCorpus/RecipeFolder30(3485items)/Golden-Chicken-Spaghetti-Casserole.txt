Title: Golden Chicken Spaghetti Casserole
Categories: Casseroles, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
12 oz Spaghetti, broken up
2 c  Diced cooked chicken
12 oz Shredded cheddar cheese
1 c  Chopped onion
1 ts Olive oil
1 lb Canned tomatoes, cut up
2 c  Well-seasoned chicken broth
Saute onion until tender.  Add tomato and broth; simmer uncovered
until sauce is reduced to 2 1/2 cups.  In greased 3-qt casserole
layer half the spaghetti, all the chicken, half the cheese, then
remaining spaghetti. Pour on sauce; sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake 40 minutes at 325F. This is recipe can be adjusted to fit your
likes (budget) without hurting it. I usually use more spaghetti and
more tomatoes, and less cheese. It also freezes well; I divide it
into two casseroles.
