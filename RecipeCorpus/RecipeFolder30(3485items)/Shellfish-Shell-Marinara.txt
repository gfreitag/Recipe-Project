For company or a special family meal, there is nothing quite like
littleneck clams and shrimp quickly cooked up in a robust marinara
sauce. (No cheese is necessary with this sauce; flavoring the oil
with garlic is the secret to its great taste.) The clams will take
longer to open than the shrimp will take to cook, so add the shrimp
at the last moment. Be sure to discard any clams that don't open -
this could mean they are not safe to eat.

1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
garlic and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until it colors slightly
but does not burn. Remove garlic from heat and carefully stir in the
tomatoes.

2. Return the pot to medium heat. Add the wine, parsley, basil,
oregano, salt, pepper and sugar. Cook sauce slowly, stirring
occasionally, for 30 minutes.

3. Slightly before serving, cook pasta in boiling, salted water for
10-12 minutes or until AL DENTE (just tender).

4. While pasta is cooking, add the clams to the sauce; cover and cook
for 8 minutes or until the clams just begin to open, shaking the pot
once or twice. Add shrimp and cook 5 minutes longer.

5. Divide the cooked pasta among six shallow bowls. Spoon the hot
sauce over the top, distributing the clams and shrimp evenly, and
serve immediately.
