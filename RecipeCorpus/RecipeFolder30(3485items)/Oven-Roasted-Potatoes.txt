Title: Oven-Roasted Potatoes
Categories: Potato, Tasteofhome
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Paprika
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
4    Baking potatoes -- (about 2
Lbs)
2 tb Butter or margarine --
Melted
These golden melt-in-your-mouth potatoes go perfectly with roast
beef. They make a homey side dish that's also convenient because they
can share the oven with the baked apple slices Mom serves for dessert.

Peel potatoes and cut into large chunks; place in a shallow 2-qt
baking pan. Pour butter over and toss until well coated. Sprinkle
with paprika, salt and pepper. Bake, uncovered, at 350~ for 45-60
minutes or until potatoes are tender.

Yield:  4 servings

Marjorie's note:  I used regular red potatoes and omited the salt
completely. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and tender on the
inside. It took longer to cook than stated, and next time I'll use
cooking spray on the glass dish, because they did stick to the bottom
of the dish. They were delicious! Next time I'll make more! Also, I
think they would be good with other seasonings on them. (The cooking
spray worked great! I used Barbque Spice instead of paprika and they
were delicious!)
