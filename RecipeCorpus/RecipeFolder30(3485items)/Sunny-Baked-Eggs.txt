An easy way to fix eggs for a crowd - Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
For each serving, toss the parsley, ham and Brie together in a 3"
wide ramekin. Break the eggs over the ham mixture and drizzle the
cream over the eggs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Place
the ramekins in a baking pan and pour hot water into the pan to come
1" up the ramekins. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, depending on how set you
want the eggs. Serve immediately. From the Silver Palate Good Time
