Title: Ma's Pea Soup^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
3    Carrots, sliced
1    Onion, chopped
Salt & pepper to taste
1 lb To 1 1/2 peas
1    Ham bone
3    Potatoes, halved
Wash and pick over peas to remove any little stones. Put in a large
kettle, cover with water and simmer a few hours. Meanwhile, simmer
ham bone covered with water, separately from the peas. When the peas
are soft, strain them. Put back into kettle, add ham picked from the
bone, ham juice and remaining ingredients. Peas will mush up and turn
into a puree as the soup finishes cooking. Simmer gently until
potatoes are done. Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
