New Orleans' most popular sausage, a type of country sausage made with
pork, or pork and beef.  It's not really smoked, but has a fine smoky
flavor that makes it an ideal seasoning meat for our favorite bean
dishes, gumbos, and jambalayas.  We also like it pan grilled as a
breakfast or dinner sausage.  [Also makes great po-boys--EC]  Allow
about 20 to 25 minutes for grilling.  When used as a seasoning meat
in other dishes, it requires no precooking.

(To make HOT sausage, omit the liquid hickory smoke and add 1 tsp
cayenne and 1 tsp black pepper.  Hot sausage is a good accompaniment
to bean dishes or smothered vegetables or as a breakfast sausage with
grits and eggs. It is not recommended as a seasoning meat in
traditional bean dishes as it is likely to overwhelm the flavor of
the other ingredients.

Prepare the sausage casings and stuffing.  Mix ingredients lightly;
the stuffing should be slightly coarse in texture.  Cut the casing
into 12 inch lengths and stuff.  Allow 2 smoked sausages per serving.
