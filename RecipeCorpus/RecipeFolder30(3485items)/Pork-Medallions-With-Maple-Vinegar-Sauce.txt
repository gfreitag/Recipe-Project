Title: Pork Medallions With Maple-Vinegar Sauce
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Dijon mustard
1 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Maple syrup
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
4    Pork chops
Pepper
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Shallots -- minced
Flatten pork chops with a meat mallet or rolling pin between two
sheets of waxed paper.  Season both sides of each chop with pepper.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat.  Add pork and
saute until brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
Transfer to plate.

Add shallots to same skillet.  Cook 30 seconds.  Mix in mustard and
chicken broth and simmer until reduced by 1/4, about 5 minutes.  Stir

consistency, about 5 minutes longer. Return pork and accumulated
juices to skillet. Cook until just heated through, about 1 minute.
Serve pork and spoon sauce over top.

NOTES:  1 Tbsp red wine vinegar may be used for balsamic vinegar.
