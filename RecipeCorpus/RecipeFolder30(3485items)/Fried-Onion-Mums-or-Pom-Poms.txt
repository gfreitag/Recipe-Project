Categories: Appetizers, Down under, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Flour
1 c  Cracker crumbs
Oil for deep frying
1 lg Texas or Vidalia Onion
Boiling water
Ice water
1    Egg; beaten
Select a well-rounded onion.  Peel outer skin off.  Leave root intact
and cut off any hanging roots.  Using a small, sharp knife, divide
onion into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the
top and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2" away.  Cut each
section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover
it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or petals, will begin to
open. Remove onion from water and immerse into ice water, which will
further the opening. Drain well by turning upside down on paper
towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat
with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to coat. Put cracker
crumbs in bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat. Refrigerate 1
hour before deep frying in oil to a golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
