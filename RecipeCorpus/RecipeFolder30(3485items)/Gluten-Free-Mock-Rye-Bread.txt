Follow directions for bread machine.  Use single rise setting. I wrap
the bread in a towel for about 4 hours after it is done baking and
then slice it thinly with an electric knife.  It freezes well. I take
individual slices of bread out the the freezer and then microwave
about 30 seconds per slice. This bread is wonderful! Many of my
non-celiac guests request this over homemade whole wheat bread. From:
