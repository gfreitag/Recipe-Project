Title: Mark's Basic Pasta Recipe
Categories: Side dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Olive oil
Water, as necessary
1 c  Durum semolina
1 c  All-purpose white flour
1 pn Salt
Combine the dry ingredients & mix.  Add the oil & slowly add as much
water as is needed to until you have a ball of dough.  Knead the
dough vigorously for several minutes, until it is very soft &
elasticky. Roll into a ball, & cover with a damp cloth.  Set aside to
rest for at least 2 hours, but be careful to ensure that the cloth
does not dry out.

When ready to make pasta, slice into four equal parts.  Either roll
out each portion until very thin & cut into desired shapes, or put
through a pasta maker until the desired thickness is reached & then
cut.

Cook in plenty of boiling, salted water for 3 or 4 minutes.  Serve
with sauce or herbs.

VARIATION: Substitute all-purpose white flour for whole-wheat flour.
