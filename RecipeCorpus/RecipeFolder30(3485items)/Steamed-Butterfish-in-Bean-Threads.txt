Title: Steamed Butterfish in Bean Threads
Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 2 servings
1/3 c  Chicken stock
2    Green onions, shredded
1 1/2 tb Shredded ginger
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Asian sesame oil
8    To 10 dried shiitake
-mushrooms
1 1/2 oz To 2 oz bundle bean threads
1 lb Butterfish (about 6),
-cleaned
There are a couple of kinds of butterfish.  One is the large
"sablefish". The other is the smaller silvery diamond shaped fish
familiar to those who hang out around Asian markets.  This calls for
the latter type.

In separate bowls, soak the mushrooms in warm water and the bean
threads in hot water until soft, 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain the
mushrooms, discard the stems, and toss the caps with a teaspoon of
soy sauce. Drain the bean threads and place in a deep heat-proof
plate or glass pie pan that will fit inside a wok or other steaming
pot.

Arrange the fish on top, tucking the mushroom caps in around them.
Pour in the chicken stock, scatter the green onion and ginger on top
of the fish, and sprinkle with the remaining soy sauce.

Bring the water in the steamer to a rolling boil and place the plate
on a rack an inch above the water.  Cover and steam for 20 minutes.
Sprinkle with the sesame oil and serve from the steaming dish. Serves
2 to 3 as a main dish, 4 with other dishes.
