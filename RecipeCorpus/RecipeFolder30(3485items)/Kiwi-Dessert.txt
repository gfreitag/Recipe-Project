Title: Kiwi Dessert
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 35 servings
1 lb Cream cheese
2/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
5-6 kiwis; strawberries,
Blueberries or raspberries
For garnish
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
2 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cornstarch
2/3 c  Water
1 1/3 c  Water; boiling
Step 1: Mix butter, powdered sugar and flour like pie crust. Pat into
an 11x15" pan. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes or until golden in
color. Step 2: Mix 2/3 cup water with cornstarch; then add the sugar.
Stir these three ingredients into the boiling water and boil one
minute; stirring constantly. Remove from heat and cool completely.
Step 3: Mix cream cheese, sugar, vanilla thoroughly and spread over
the cold crust. Step 4: Peel and thinly slice kiwis. Place evenly on
the cream cheese mixture which covers the crust. Each proposed piece
of the dessert should be centered with a slice of kiwi. A pan of this
size could serve as many as 35 and thus will require 35 slices of
kiwi. Pour cooled sugar/cornstarch/water mixture over the sliced
kiwi. Refrigerate at least four hours. Cut into squares. Garnish with
strawberries, raspberries or blueberries. Submitted By DAN KLEPACH
