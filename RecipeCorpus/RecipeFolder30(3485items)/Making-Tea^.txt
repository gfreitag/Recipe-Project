Title: Making Tea^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
1    Text recipe
Scald an earthenware or china teapot; put in 1 teaspoon tea and pour
on 2 cups of boiling water. Let stand on back of range or in a warm
place 5 minutes. Strain and serve immediately with or without sugar
and milk. Avoid a second steeping of leaves with the addition of a
few fresh ones. If this is done, so large an amount of tannin is
extracted that various ills are apt to follow. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
