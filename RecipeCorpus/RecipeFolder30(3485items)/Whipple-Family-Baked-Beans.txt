Title: Whipple Family Baked Beans
Categories: Casseroles, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1    Pc Salt Pork (3" Square)
1    Onion -- whole or sliced
2 tb Molasses
2 c  Dried Beans (Yellow-Eyed,
-Kidney or Pea), soaked
-overnight
Soak beans overnight in cold water. Next morning, boil the beans in 4
cups of water until they look as if they will burst when you blow on
them. Drain and transfer to a 1-qt bean pot or pottery casserole.

Make 1" gashes every 1/2" in the salt pork, without cutting through
the rind. Then push it into the beans with just the top showing. Add
the onion and push it down. Add the molasses and 1 cup of water.
Cover the beans and cook in a 250 F oven for 4 hours. If too dry, add
a little more water. After 4 hours, raise the temperature to 350 F,
remove the cover, and brown the top for 1 more hour.

Mrs. Whipple's note: "Don't add ketchup to the baked beans--that's
not the old-fashioned way. If you like, add 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1
Tbs brown sugar and a bit more molasses."
