The secret to tender baked beans is to leave the salt out until they
are finished cooking. For some reason, salt toughens them. To pamper
your tummy, rinse off the beans when they are finished soaking in
several changes of cold water. This recipe is easy to prepare ahead
and cooks in only two hours.

1. Place the beans in a bowl, cover with cold water and soak
overnight. Drain and rinse beans very well under cold water.

2. Place the beans in a large, heavy pot. Add enough water to cover
the beans by 2". Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and
cook for 45 minutes, or until beans are tender but not mushy. Skim
off any foam that rises to the surface. Drain the beans.

3. Place the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof casserole. Add the
onions and wilt over medium-low heat until transluscent. Remove from
heat and stir in the beans.

4. Stir in the tomatoes and reserved juices along with all remaining
ingredients except the salt and pepper.

5. Bake, covered, for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 30 minutes
more. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
