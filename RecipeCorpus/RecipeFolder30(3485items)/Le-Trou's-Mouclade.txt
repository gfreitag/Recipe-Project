Title: Le Trou's Mouclade
Categories: French, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  White wine (240ml)
1/2 ts Saffron threads
1 c  Heavy cream (240ml)
1 tb Fresh parsley, chopped
1    Clove garlic, mashed
3 qt Mussels, cleaned
6 tb Unsalted butter (75g)
6    Shallots, chopped fine
Bouquet garni (celery, bay
-leaf, thyme, parsley stems)
This one is almost enough to get me off my duff and over to the coast
to gather some mussels.

Robert Reynolds, chef/owner of Le Trou Restaurant Francais in San
Francisco provides this recipe.  He has used it as a vehicle for
teaching his students about saffron's special qualities.  This recipe
originated in the French Bordeaux region.

Steep threads in wine for 30 minutes.  Saute 6 shallots in butter
until limp.  Add Bouquet garni and wine.  Simmer for 1 minute.  Add
cleaned mussels, cover pan with tight-fitting lid, and steam mussels
open, shaking pan occasionally.  Check after 3 minutes.  Remove
opened mussels and set in colander over a bowl to catch their juices.
Discard any mussels not opened after 6 minutes.  Saute remaining
shallots in butter until limp. Add mussel juice and cream and reduce
to desired consistency. Add parsley and garlic, then toss mussels in
sauce until well coated. Serve in soup bowls.
