Whenever cold soups call for chicken broth, be sure to defat it
completely for best results. Also, black pepper is the only spice in
this chowder, so freshly ground is a MUST.

1. Place broth, corn cobs and dill sprigs in a heavy pot. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat, simmer 10 minutes. Discard cobs and dill.

2. Add potatoes to broth and cook for 8 minutes or until tender. Add
corn kernels and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat; pour soup
through a strainer, reserving vegetables and broth.

3. Place yogurt and 2/3 of the diced cucumbers in the bowl of a food
processor; pulse on and off just to combine ingredients (so some
texture remains). With motor on, pour in 1 cup of reserved broth
through feed tube and pulse machine on to just combine ingredients.
Remove to a bowl. Save any leftover broth for another use.

4. Stir in the reserved vegetables, remaining diced cucumber, bell
pepper and chopped dill. Season with fresh black pepper. Refrigerate
for up to 2 hours. Serve chilled.

NOTE: If you like, cut 3 more ears of corn (with kernels) into 1"
lengths and cook separately for 2-3 minutes. Then divide corn between
bowls and ladle soup on top.
