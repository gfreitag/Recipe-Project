From the traditional to the (comparatively) new-fangled.  Stained
glass or bishopcakes, very popular in the US, are so called, one
presumes, because they consist almost entirely of glace fruit and
nuts, and the glace fruit has something of the translucency of a
stained-glass church window.

[This is news to me.  I've never heard either of the two terms
applied to fruit cakes.  Other terms, maybe, but not those...  S.C.]

Butter a round 23 an cake tin and line with grease proof paper.

Butter the grease proof.  Chop the glace fruits roughly.  Sift
together the flour and baking powder.  Mix in all the fruits,
together with the nuts. Put the mixture into the cake tin, wet hands
and press mixture down firmly.

Bake in a preheated 150C oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Take cake out of the
oven and drizzle the Grand Marnier or Cointreau over the top.  Leave
the cake in the oven to cool to warm then wrap it, tin and all, in
aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight.

Remove from tin, peel away paper and store in airtight tin.
