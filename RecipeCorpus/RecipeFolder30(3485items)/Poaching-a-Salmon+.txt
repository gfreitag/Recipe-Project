Title: Poaching a Salmon+
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 1 salmon
3    Sprigs thyme
1    Salmon, fresh or frozen and
-thawed, about 4 lbs.
Splash of Balsamic vinegar
3    Sprigs of Tarragon
5    Cloves
3    Sprigs parsley
1/4 c  Celery leaves
Saute, in a dry pan, the tarragon, cloves, celery tops, parsley and
thyme till fragrant.

Wash the fish thoroughly and wrap in cheesecloth. Tie it to the rack
insert. Cheesecloth and tying the fish in isn't necessary if it's a
small fish.

Fill poacher with water and bring to a simmer (or I should say a
shimmer) at which you keep the water throughout the cooking process.

Add the herbs and Balsamic vinegar and the fish on the rack. Cook 4
minutes per pound or until a thin metal skewer is inserted into the
thickest part of the fish for a couple seconds. Withdraw quickly and
place tip on your lower lip. Cold means rare; lukewarm - almost done;
fully warm - perfect; hot - overcooked.

I've used this recipe more than a couple times and find if you follow
the instructions to the letter the fish will turn out wonderfully.
