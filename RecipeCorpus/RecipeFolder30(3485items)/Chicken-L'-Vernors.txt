*  If you can't get Vernor's Ginger ale, use regular ginger ale but
double the amount of fresh ginger to 4 slices, and add a dash of
vanilla to the orange juice.  This will approximate the flavor of the
real thing.

Remove fat from cavity of duck; cut off extra neck skin.  Wipe
quartered pieces with damp cloth, sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place skin side down on roasting pan.  Bake 50 minutes.  As duck
bakes, combine Vernors and ginger slices in saucepan.  Simmer until
reduced to 1 cup.  Add orange juice, brown sugar, marmalade, mustard,
scallions and 2 T brandy.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer
until mixture is like a thin syrup, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove ginger.
Turn duck skin side up, drain fat, and baste thoroughly with Vernors
sauce.  Return to oven; bake another 45 minutes, basting every 10
minutes.  Add remaining brandy to sauce and simmer until thickened.
Remove duck to heated plater and pour on the sauce. Garnish with
orange slices and serve.
