1/8 ts Ground red pepper
2    To 2 1/2 pounds meaty

-thighs, drumsticks)

I use one of those cut-up chickens and I also usually double the
amount of glaze.

Rinse chicken; pat dry.  Place chicken pieces, skin side down, on the
unheated rack of a broiler pan.  Broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat
about 20 minutes or till lightly browned.

Stir together all other ingredients for glaze.  Brush chicken with
glaze. Turn chicken; brush with more glaze.  Broil for 5 to 15
minutes more or till tender and no longer pink, brushing often with
glaze during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
