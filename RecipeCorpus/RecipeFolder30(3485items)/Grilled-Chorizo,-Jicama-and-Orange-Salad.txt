Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
2 ts Paprika
4 lg Parsley sprigs
1 lb Jicama
3/4 lb Chorizo or pepperoni

In her book "Little Meals" (Villard Books), Rozanne Gold uses jicama
as a bed for warm, spicy chorizo and the drippings that mingle with
citrus juices.

Peel the jicama and cut into matchstick julienne. Set aside.

Cut sausage into 1/2" thick slices, broil on tray until cooked
through. Keep warm.

Divide jicama among 4 plates. Top each portion with 5 orange segments,
sprinkle with 1 tablespoon lemon juice, top with 6-7 slices of
sausage with drippings, sprinkle with paprika and garnish with
parsley.
