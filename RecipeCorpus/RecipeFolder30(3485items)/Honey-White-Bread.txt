1. Scald the milk. Remove from heat and add in the butter and honey.
Stir until the butter melts. Let cool to room temperature. 2. Add the
milk mixture and all remaining ingredients in the order suggested by
your ABM manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions. The bread is good warm, cool, or toasted.
It stales faster than store-bought white bread, so wrap the loaf well
and use quickly or freeze.
