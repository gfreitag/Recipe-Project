Title: Boston Brown Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 servings
1 ts Salt
3/4 c  Molasses
2 c  Sour Milk Or 1 3/4 C Sweet
Milk
3/4 c  Raisins -- optional
1 c  Rye Meal Or Whole-Wheat
Flour
1 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Graham Flour
3/4 c  Baking Soda
Mix and sift the meals and flours with the baking soda and salt. Add
the molasses and milk and stir well. Add the raisins, well floured.

Butter well a brown-bread tin and cover, or a 1-pound coffee tin.
Fill 2/3 full and cover. Tie down the bread-tin cover with string, or
cover the coffee tin with aluminum foil and string (as the bread
rises, it might force off the cover).

Place the tin on a rack in a large pot filled to halfway up the sides
of the tin with boiling water. Cover tightly and let steam for 3 1/2
hours for the larger mold or 1 1/2 to 2 hrs for the 1-lb coffee tin.

Remove the mold from the water, take off the cover, and set the mold
in a 300 F oven for 15 mins to dry out a bit.

Remove the bread from the mold and eat warm with lots of butter and
baked beans.
