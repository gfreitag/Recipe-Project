Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1 sm Onion (or 2 shallots), diced
1/2 ts Dried thyme, tarragon, or
-rosemary
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/4 c  Heavy cream or half-and-half
-(optional)
2 1/2 lb Meaty chicken breasts or
-thighs
2 tb Vegetable oil (or more, if
-needed)
2 tb Butter or margarine

Skin chicken pieces, if desired.  Heat oil and butter in large, heavy
skillet over medium heat.  Add chicken in one layer, without
crowding; cook in two batches if necessary.  Cook until lightly
browned, about 5 minutes; turn and brown other side.  Season lightly
with salt and pepper. If cooking two batches, remove cooked chicken
from skillet and keep warm while cooking second batch.  Arrange all
of the chicken in the skillet and sprinkle with onion and dried herb;
saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour wine over chicken, cover, and simmer
until tender, about 12 to 15 minutes for breast meat or 15 to 18
minutes for thighs.  Uncover and boil briskly for 1 to 2 minutes.
Remove chicken to a warm platter.  Stir cream into sauce and pour
over chicken.  Serve immediately (with rice cooked in chicken broth).

Makes about 6 servings.
