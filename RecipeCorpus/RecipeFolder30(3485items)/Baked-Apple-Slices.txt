Nothing beats these tender apple slices over ice cream for satisfying
harvest flavor. This old-fashioned treat gives a new twist to
traditional baked apples. They are also excellent served over waffles
or with ham. I make sure to save room for dessert!

Place apples in a greased 1-qt baking dish. Combine sugar, cinnamon,
nutmeg, ginger, and apple cider; pour over apples. Dot with butter.
Sprinkle with nuts or raisins. Bake, uncovered, at 350~ for 45-60
minutes or until apples are tender. Serve warm over ice cream.
