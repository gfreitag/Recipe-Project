Wash and peel 2 pounds white turnips and cut them into eighths.
Simmer them in boiling salted water to cover for 10 to 15 minutes, or
until they are tender. Drain them thoroughly and season them well
with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Arrange the turnips in a
warm serving dish, pour over them 1/2 stick or 1/4 cup butter,
browned, and grate the rind of 1 lemon over the top. Sprinkle the
turnips with the juice of the lemon and border the dish with 1/4 cup
chopped parsley mixed with 2 hard-boiled eggs, put through a medium
sieve. From the files of Joyce Monschein
