Title: Pasta Primer
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 servings
No ingredients
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water, with a tablespoon
of olive oil added to keep pasta from sticking together. After adding
pasta, stir once.

Pasta should be cooked until it is just tender - not too hard and not
too soft - or AL DENTE ("to the tooth"). Taste for doneness as it
cooks. Cooking time starts when the water returns to a full boil
after adding pasta.

Dry pasta takes longer to cook than fresh. Begin tasting after it has
cooked for 5-6 minutes, depending on the shape and size. Fresh pasta
may take no longer than 2-3 minutes.

For hot pasta dishes, rinse just-cooked pasta under warm water to
remove starch, if desired. (A bit of starch holds the sauce better.)
Rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Pasta is best when
drained and served with sauce immediately.

For best flavor when making pasta salads, toss pasta with a
vinaigrette-style dressing while it's still warm.

Rule of thumb: heavy sauces for heavy, shaped pastas and thick
ribbons; light sauces for small, shaped pastas and thin ribbons.

Save a small amount of hot cooking liquid to toss into the pasta if it
seems too dry, depending on the sauce.

When serving cheese, use only freshly grated. Invest in a large
piece. It keeps refrigerated for a long time when well wrapped.

It's fun and practical to serve pasta in shallow bowls.

For best results, use a large tossing bowl, so the pasta and sauce
are not cramped.
