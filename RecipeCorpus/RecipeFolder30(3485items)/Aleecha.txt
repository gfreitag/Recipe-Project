Aleecha is a mixed vegetable stew. Quemam contains an ingredient not
found in the US.  I'd substitute dry berebere.
In dry pan over moderate low heat, stir fry onion, garlic, and
carrots for 2 mins.  Add 1/2c of the water and cook  5 mins longer.
Add the oil and continue to simmer.

Add the tumeric, chilies, and cabbage.  Cover the pan and steam to
reduce the bulk for 2 mins.  Stir well and add the quemam, tomato
paste, salt and the potatoes.

Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins.  Add the remaining water and
simmer for 5 minutes more to soften the potatoes and thicken the
sauce somewhat.

Serve at room temperature with Injeera.
