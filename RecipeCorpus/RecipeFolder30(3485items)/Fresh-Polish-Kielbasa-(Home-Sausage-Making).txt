"Recipes for this sausage are so variable that what passes for
kielbasa in one area might be regarded as not authentic in another.
The ingredients and pronunciation of kielbasa are as variable as are
the vagaries of the spring weather, the time of year when kielbasa is
traditionally made. This version uses pork, beef, and veal and makes
five pounds."

1. Prepare the casings.

2. Grind the meats and fat together through the coarse disk.

3. Mix the remaining ingredients with the meat.

4. Stuff the casings and leave the sausage in long links. Lengths of
eighteen inches to two feet are traditional.

5. Allow the sausage to dry in a cool place for three or four hours or
refrigerate for twenty-four hours uncovered.

6. Cook by roasting in a 425~ F. oven for forty-five minutes. These
sausages are also excellent grilled over a charcoal fire and eaten in
a Kaiser roll, lathered with a spicy brown mustard.
