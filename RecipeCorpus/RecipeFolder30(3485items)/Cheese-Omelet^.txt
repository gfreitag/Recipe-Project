Title: Cheese Omelet^
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Pepper
2 tb Butter
Salt, if needed
3    Eggs
3 tb Water
2 tb Mild grated cheese
Beat the eggs lightly, add water and seasoning. Melt butter in an
omelet pan, pour in the eggs and stir and lightly mix lightly till
they begin to set. Sprinkle with the cheese, then scrape and push the
omelet to one side of the pan. Cook about 1 minute, then either turn
in the pan by slipping a knife under the omelet or hold the pan for a
moment in front of the fire or under the flame of the gas range. Turn
onto a hot dish and serve at once. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
