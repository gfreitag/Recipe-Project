In large saute pan or wok, stir-fry chard, mustard greens and kale
just with water clinging to leaves after rinsing. After green have
cooked 3-5 minutes, add garlic and cook until all greens are tender,
about 10 minutes, stirring frequently to keep from scorching. Add 1/2
of lemon juice and stir until all moisture is re-absorbed. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.

Heat non-stick saute pan over high heat. When very hot, add mushrooms
and cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until browned. Add to
greens and allow to cool completely. Mixture should be completely dry.

In large mixing bowl, combine ricotta, goat cheese and lemon zest. Add
remaining 1/2 of lemon juice and stir to combine. When greens are
completely cool, add to cheese mixture and stir well. Season to taste
with salt.

After Fresh Pasta has been made, assemble lasagna. Spread bottom and
sides of glass baking pan with 3/4 cup of tomato puree. Cook pasta in
pot of boiling water. Drain. Then lay 1 sheet of pasta in bottom of
pan. It should cover bottom completely. Spread 1/2 of cheese mixture
over pasta sheet. Sprinkle 1/3 of mozzarella over top.

Repeat layering once more, finishing with third sheet of pasta. Spread
remaining tomato puree over top and sprinkle with remaining
mozzarella. Bake at 300'F. 30-45 minutes, until heated through.
