Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 30 servings
MMMMM-----------------------GLAZED ALMONDS----------------------------
1 1/2 tb Amaretto liquor
1 1/2 ts Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Slivered almonds
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 sm Egg; room temperature
2 ts Amaretto liquor
Sugar
Powdered sugar, optional
1 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 pn Salt
1/2 c  Unsalted butter; room temp.
1/2 c  Sugar
For almonds:  Melt butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat.
Add almonds and amaretto and stir until almonds are golden brown,
about 5 minutes.  Cool on paper towels.

For dough:  Preheat oven to 350-degrees.  Lightly grease 2 large
baking sheets.  Sift 1 cup flour with salt into small bowl.  Using
electric mixer, cream butter with 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until
light and fluffy. Blend in egg and amaretto.  Add flour and mix until
dough binds. (Dough will be sticky.)

Divide dough into 30 pieces.  Roll each between palms into balls,
dusting hands with flour if necessary.  Set on baking sheets, spacing
2 inches apart.

Fill small bowl with water.  Mound sugar on plate.  Dip bottom of
2-1/2" round glass into water and then into sugar.  Press glass down
onto 1 dough ball, flattening into 2-1/2- to 3-inch round.  Repeat
with remaining dough. Sprinkle rounds lightly with sugar.

Gently press several glazed almond slivers into each round in flower
pattern.  Bake until edges of cookies are golden brown, 8 to 10
minutes. Cool on rack.  Just before serving, dust cookies with
powdered sugar if desired.
