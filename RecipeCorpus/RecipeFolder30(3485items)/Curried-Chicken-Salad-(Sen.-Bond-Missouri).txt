Note from Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri - Following my son,
Sam's, christening at the First Presbyterian Church in my hometown of
Mexico, this savory chicken salad was featured along with asparagus
and a watermelon basket brimming with fresh fruit. That Father's Day
in 1981 is a date we'll never forget.

Combine chicken, scallions, and water chestnuts with rice. In a
separate bowl, combine mayonnaise, chutney, curry, salt and pepper.
Mix well. Thoroughly combine mayonnaise dressing with chicken-rice
mixture. Chill. Taste and adjust seasonings. Cut bananas diagonally
into 1" slices. Dip slices into lemon juice and coat with peanuts. To
serve, arrange salad on small platter. Surround salad with banana
slices and garnish with chopped nuts. Additional condiments may be
served: chopped green peppers, toasted almonds, plumped raisins and
coconut are a few choices. Yield: 6-8 servings. Source: The NEw
