Title: Caramel-Pecan Marshmallows
Categories: Candies
Yield: 32 servings
1/2 lb Marshmallows --
(approximately 32)
1/2 lb Caramel candy -- (vanilla)
3 tb Hot water
3/4 c  Pecans -- finely chopped
* Toasted coconut may be substituted for part or all of the pecans.

Line a cookie sheet with waxed paper. Place the caramels and hot
water in top of double boiler. Heat over simmering water, stirring
often, until caramels are melted. Use a fork or thick skewer to hold
marshmallow; dip into melted caramel and turn to coat entire surface.
Roll the marshmallow in the finely chopped pecans. Place each on the
waxed paper. Work quickly to coat each marshmallow. Stir the caramel
mixture occasionally to keep it smooth. When all are finished, place
in a cool place until caramel is firm. Store in a covered container
in a cool place.

Yield: 32 covered marshmallows. Double this recipe if you wish,
remembering to work quickly so caramel will not cool too soon.
