Title: Maryland Black Cake
Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 cake
4 c  (level) seeded raisins
6 c  (level) currants
2 ts (level) Baking powder
1/2 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Fruit juice
4 c  (level) shredded candied
-citron peel
1 c  BUTTER *
2 2/3 c  (level) brown sugar
1 ea Nutmeg; grated
2 ts (level) powdered cinnamon
1 ts (level) powdered cloves
1 tb (level) powdered ginger
6 ea Eggs; separated
2 1/2 c  (level) flour
* Untested. I don't know if substituting salt-free Margarine for
butter will work, or if such even exists.

Cream butter [margarine?] well; add one-half of sugar mixed with
spices and mix well, now add remainder of sugar mixed with beaten
yolks of eggs, and beat for five minutes (this was meant for
hand-beating). Beat up whites of eggs and add them to mixture. Now
add flour mixed with currants and raisins cut in halves, baking
powder mixed with molasses and wine. Mix carefully and place
one-fourth of this mixture in a large cake pan lined with greased
paper, then sprinkle in a layer of citron. Repeat until batter and
citron are all used. Bake in a moderate oven for four hours. [Be
careful]...the cake burns easily. It may be necessary to put a pan of
hot water in the oven to moderate the heat, or to place a tin or
asbestos mat underneath. Sufficient for one large cake.
