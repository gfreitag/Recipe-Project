Categories: Breads, African, Homemade
Yield: 8 breads
3 tb Club soda
3 c  Warm water
2 1/2 c  Self rising flour;GoldMedal
Place warm water into food blender. Add flour to water and blend,
slowly at first, then with rapid speed. <Do in two batches unless you
have a large and powerful blender> Remember to scrape down sides of
bowl with rubber spatula.

Place batter in 6 cup bowl and stir in the club soda.

Heat 12 inch electric frying pan <SiverStone lined> to 400. Using
ladle, pour 1/4c of batter onto one corner of the hot pan.
Immediately tilt the pan about to cover the bottom of the pan evenly
with the batter. Cook, uncovered, until the top of the pancakelike
bread is filled with holes and is no longer wet.  The edges should
begin to curl just a bit. Remove quickly with your fingers and place
the bread on a kitchen towel. Let it cool 3 or 4 mins as you prepare
the next bread. Place the cooled breads on a plate.

Continue this process until all of the batter is used. Stack the
cooled breads one on top of the other and cover with plastic wrap
until dinner.

Can be made 3 hours in advance of dinner.
