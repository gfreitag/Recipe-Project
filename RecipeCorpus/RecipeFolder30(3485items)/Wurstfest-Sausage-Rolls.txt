Title: Wurstfest Sausage Rolls
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 36 rolls
1 c  Hot water
3    Eggs, beaten
4 1/2 c  Flour
Wurst sausage, cut into
1 1/2" x 1" strips
1 pk Dry yeast
1 tb Warm water
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Shortening
1 ts Salt
Combine yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon sugar; set aside.  Combine
shortening, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, water, and eggs; beat well.  Stir in
another 2 - 2 1/2 cups of the flour to make a soft dough. Refrigerate
covered dough in large mixing bowl overnight.  Divide dough into three
portions.  Roll one portion of dough into circle 1/4" thick and cut
with biscuit cutter into 2-inch diameter circles. Simmer sausages in
covered pan about 5 minutes.  Moisten edges of dough with water, lap
one side of dough over sausage and press edges of dough together to
seal. Repeat with remaining dough.  Place rolls on greased cookie
sheet and let rise about 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled. Bake in
preheated 350F oven about 10 - 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
