Title: Buffalo Turkey Wings
Categories: Poultry
Vegetable Oil 3/4 cup all
6 tbsp. butter, melted 1/2 tsp. salt 2
Yield: 4 servings  4 turkey wings, about 5 lbs
purpose flour
tbsp. distilled white vinegar 1 tsp. cayenne pepper 2 tbsp. hot red
pepper sauce Cut off wing tips; reserve for other use.

Cut wing into 2 pieces at joint. Combine
flour, salt and cayenne pepper on a plate.  Dust wings in flour
mixture, shaking off excess.  Heat 1-1/2 inches of oil in large
skillet over medium heat.  Add wings in single layer and fry, turning
once, until browned, 10 minutes; drain on paper towels.  Repeat with
remaining wings. ***I skipped their sauce and did it this way,
because I thought it sounded better. :-) Combine butter, Kraft
Bar-b-q sauce, a little cayenne. Place wings in a large baking pan;
drizzle on sauce over wings.  Bake in 375 oven, 1 hour, basting 4 or
5 times, turning once, until wings are browned. Serves 4
