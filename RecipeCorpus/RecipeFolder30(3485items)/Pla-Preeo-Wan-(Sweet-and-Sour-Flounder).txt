While I was in Southeast Asia, I tasted a wonderful broiled flounder,
topped with a sweet-and-sour sauce of pineapple, cucumber, tomato and
onion. For spice, I've added lots of fresh ginger and garlic. Serve
the fish in shallow bowls, with the sauce ladled atop.

1. Carefully remove any tiny bones from flounder with a tweezer. Set
fish on a broiler tray lined with aluminum foil. Preheat broiler.

2. Combine diced pineapple, cucumber, tomatoes, onions and pineapple
juice in a heavy saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

3. Reduce heat, add garlic and ginger, season with salt and continue
cooking for another 5 minutes.

4. Remove 1/4 cup of liquid from saucepan and mix it with cornstarch
until smooth. Stir back into saucepan and cook, stirring, 2 minutes
more to thicken fruit sauce slightly. Remove from heat; set aside.

5. Brush fish fillets with olive oil and drizzle with lime juice.
Sprinkle with salt. Place fish 4" from heat source and broil 4-5
minutes, or until fish is opaque and flakes easily. Remove, cut in
half crosswise and place one piece of fish in each of 8 shallow bowls.

6. Heat fruit sauce for 1 minute over medium heat, stir in cilantro
and ladle evenly over fish. Serve immediately.
