Title: Chips
Categories: Snacks, Low cal/fat, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Vinegar, malt
Another way to make wonderful chips is to mix MALT Vinegar (not
regular vinegar) and water in a spray bottle. Lightly spray corn,
pita, flour chips. Then sprinkle with your favorite seasonings:
garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, whatever. Bake at 325 for
10-15 minutes. Watch closely so you don't overcook.  They are
fabulous and a lot cheaper than the commercial.
