Soak cucumbers, peppers, cabbage, onions, and tomatoes in salt water
overnight (1/2 cup salt to 2 quarts water).  DRAIN.

Cook carrots and green beans in boiling water until tender.  DRAIN.

Mix soaked and cooked vegetables with remaining ingredients and boil
10 minutes.  Place in steralized jars; seal at once.  Process in
water bath for 5 minutes.

Note:  I use zucchini in place of cukes or with.  I also add hot
pepper to make it more tasty and zippy.
