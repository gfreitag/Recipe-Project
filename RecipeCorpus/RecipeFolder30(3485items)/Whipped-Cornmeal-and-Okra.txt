Title: Whipped Cornmeal and Okra
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter, cut into pieces
2 c  Water
6    Pods fresh, tender okra
1 c  White cornmeal
Bring the water to a gentle boil in a 3-quart saucepan, add okra and
cook for about 10 minutes.  Remove the okra with a slotted spoon and
set aside.

Raise the heat under the saucepan so the water boils briskly.  Add the
cornmeal in a thin, steady stream, stirring all the while to prevent
lumping.  Add the salt and okra; cook, stirring for 10 to 12 minutes.
Remove from heat and add the butter a piece at a time, stirring after
each addition, until all the butter is incorporated.  Keep stirring
until this okra has practically disappeared and the cornmeal is light.

Correct seasoning and serve hot.

Serves 4.
