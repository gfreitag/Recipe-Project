Mary Anne Tyndall's Pillsbury Bake-Off grand prize-winning recipe:

Preheat oven to 350'F. In medium saucepan, combine chocolate chips and
butter; cook and stir over very low heat until chips are melted and
smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk; mix well.

Lightly grease spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In medium
bowl, combine flour, optional nuts, chocolate mixture and vanilla;
mix well. Shape 1 tablespoon (use measuring spoon) of dough around
each candy kiss, covering completely. Place 1" apart on ungreased
cookie sheets.

Bake at 350'F. for 6-8 minutes. Cookies will be soft and appear shiny
but will become firm as they cool. Do not overbake. Remove from
cookie sheets and cool.

For the glaze: Combine white baking bar and shortening in small
saucepan. Over low heat, stir until mixture is melted and smooth.
Drizzle over cookies. Store in tightly covered container.
