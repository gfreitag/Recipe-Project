Cut the salmon into 6 equal serving pieces, wash, and pat dry on paper
towels. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Sear the salmon on each side for 2-3 minutes, keeping the center
slightly rare since the fish will continue to cook after it is taken
from the pan. Remove the fish from the pan with a slotted spatula and
keep warm. Reduce the heat to low and add the shallots and garlic to
the pan. Saute, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.

Add the basil, parsley, wine, cream, lemon juice, pepper and salt to
the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the
mixture is reduced by half. Taste for seasoning, adding pepper and
salt as needed.

To serve, reheat the fish slightly in the sauce and the serve the
sauce around the salmon fillets.

NOTE: The fish can be prepared up to three hours in advance. Reheat
the fish in the sauce over low heat, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
