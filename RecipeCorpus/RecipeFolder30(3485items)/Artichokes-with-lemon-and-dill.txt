Categories: Vegetables, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Water (or more)
1/4 c  Fresh dill, chopped
2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Flour
2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 c  Lemon juice
6    Artichokes, fresh (3-4 lbs)
1    Lemon, halved
1/3 c  Olive oil
8    Green onions, chopped
Pour 2 Tbsp lemon juice into a large bowl of water. Cut stem from 1
artichoke; pull off and discard 3 outer bottom layers of leaves,
exposing pale green base.  Carefully trim base and leaf ends. Cut
arichoke in half. Using a small spoon, remove choke and prickly
leaves from center. Rub cut edge of artichoke with the cut side of
lemon half. Place artichoke in bowl of lemon water. Repeat with
remaining artichokes.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over med-high heat. Add chopped green
onions, saute until tender about 3 minutes. Add 3 cups water, dill,
sugar, salt and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Bring to simmer. Drain
artichokes, add to Dutch oven; cover and simmer until artichoke
bottoms are tender and leaves can be pulled off easily; occasionally
push artichokes under water while cooking, about 30 minutes. Using
slotted spoon, transfer artichokes to platter and cover with foil to
keep warm.

Place flour in small bowl, whisk in 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.
Pour flour mixture into liquid in Dutch oven; bring to boil, stirring
constantly and thinning with more water if necessary, about 2
minutes. Season with salt & pepper. Pour over artichokes and serve
warm or room temperature.
