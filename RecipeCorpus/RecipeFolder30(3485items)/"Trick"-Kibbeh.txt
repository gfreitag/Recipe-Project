The "trick" in this Syrian-Lebanese vegetable soup is that there's no
meat in the kibbeh "meatballs." The idea that a vegetarian dish is a
deception (vegetarian dolmas are known as yalanji, the Turkish word
for "counterfeit") goes back at least 1,200 years in the Near East.

In bowl, mix bulgur, flour, 1/2 tablespoon salt, cinnamon, green
onions, mint and parsley. Add enough water to make thick dough. Rolls
into 24 very firmly packed balls the size of large marbles. Set aside
to dry.

Put 9 cups chicken stock in pot, add lentils and bring to boil 10
minutes. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons, reduce heat and simmer until lentils
are tender, 20-25 minutes.

Add bulgur balls and boil 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, garlic and oil.
Simmer until balls are done, 10 minutes. Garnish with thin lemon
slices.
