Yield: 2 servings
1 pk (1/4 Oz) Active Dry Yeast
1/4 c  Warm Water
3 c  Whole-Wheat Flour
2 c  Soy Flour Or Unbleached
White
Flour
1/2 c  Wheat Germ
1/2 c  Bran
1 tb Safflower Or Corn Oil
1 tb Butter
1 tb Honey
1 tb Molasses
1 tb Brown Sugar
2 1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Boiling Water
1 c  Scalded Milk
Place oil, butter, honey, molasses, brown sugar, and salt in a large
mixing bowl. Pour in the boiling water and scalded milk, stir well
and cool until luke warm. Mix yeast in warm water and add to bowl of
lukewarm liquids (hot liquid will kill the rising action of the
yeast, so be forewarned). Stir in flours, wheat germ and bran,
blending well until dough is moist but not stickly. Turn it onto a
floured board and let rest 10 mins. The knead, adding more of any
flour if necessary, until dough is an elastic and smooth ball. Place
in a greased bowl and turn dough so that the whole ball is oiled,
then cover bowl with a tea towel and let dough rise in warm place (70
~ 80 F) - in direct sunshine, on top of TV, or near stove, etc.-
until doubled in bulk. This usually takes from 1 to 2 hrs, depending
on the available heat. After the dough has risen, puch down, sprinkle
with flour and knead slightly on the board, shaping it into 2 loaves.
Place dough in 2 greased 8-inch bread pans, cover, and let rise until
again doubled in size. This takes from 45 mins to an hour. Bake in a
preheated 350 F oven for 45 mins to 1 hr or until bread is nicely
browned and the edges have pulled away from the sides of the pans.
Remove from pans and cool. This bread, wrapped in heavy foil, will
keep in freezer for up to 3 mons.
