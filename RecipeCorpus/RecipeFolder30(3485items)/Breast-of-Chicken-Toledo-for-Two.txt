Title: Breast of Chicken Toledo for Two
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Sweet sherry
2 tb Fresh lime juice
1 ds Tabasco sauce
1/3 c  Pimento-stuffed green
-olives, sliced
1    Lime, quartered
2    Parsley sprigs
1    Whole chicken breast,
-halved, boned, and skinned
1/4 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Paprika
1 tb Olive oil
4    Scallions, sliced
1    Clove garlic, crushed
Flatten the chicken breast halves between two sheets of waxed paper
with the side of a cleaver or a rolling pin.  Mix the flour, salt,
pepper and paprika.  Dredge the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour
and set aside. Heat the olive over medium heat in a frying pan; add
the scallions and garlic.  Saute and stir for about 2 minutes.
Remove with a slotted spoon to a heated dish.

Add the butter to the same frying pan.  Add the chicken pieces when
the butter is bubbly.  Fry the chicken until brown, about 3 minutes
on each side.  Increase heat to high; add the sherry, lime juice,
Tabasco sauce, sliced olives and the reserved scallions and garlic.
Cook less than 2 minutes.  Remove the chicken to heated serving
plates.  Spoon the sauce from the pan over the chicken.  Garnish with
lime quarters and parsley sprigs.

Serve with an 8-ounce can of stewed tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of
bottled Caesar-type salad dressing mixed in with it and sprinkled
with Parmesan cheese.

NOTE:  This recipe can be doubled.
