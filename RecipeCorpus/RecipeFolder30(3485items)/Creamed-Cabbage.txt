Title: Creamed Cabbage
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
A few sprinklings of nutmeg
1 c  Heavy (whipping) cream
1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
3 c  Thinly sliced cabbage, red
-or green
1 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 350'F.

Spray a shallow baking dish - such as a pie pan - with non-stick
baking spray. Spread the sliced cabbage around in the dish as evenly
as possible. Scatter sugar, salt and nutmeg over the cabbage and pour
in the cream.

Top with bread crumbs in as even a layer as you can make it. Bake at
350'F. for 45 minutes.

NOTE: This is a very flexible dish. It can bake for an hour at 325'F.
or a half-hour at 375'F., so it can go into the oven with something
else. You may also substitute evaporated skimmed milk for the heavy
cream if butterfat is a concern for you, although the dish will not
be quite as pleasing in that case.
