Title: Maple Tourlouche ( Upside Down Cake )
Categories: Cake/cookie, Canadian
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg or cinnamon
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Nutmeats -- finely chopped
(opt)
1 c  Maple
1 tb Butter -- softened
3 tb Sugar
1    Egg
1 c  Flour -- all purpose
2 ts Baking powder
Bring syrup to a boil and pour into a generously buttered 8 by 8 by2
baking dish.  Let stand in a warm place.  With a large spoon beat
butter, sugar and egg together until creamy. Mix remaining dry
ingredients and add with the milk to the creamed mixture, stirring
until well blended. Place as four large balls into hot syrup, then
stretch dough with two forks until all are joined together.  This is
easy because the dough gets soft when it comes in contact with the
hot syrup. If using nut meats, add them to the hot syrup. Bake at 350
degrees for 30 minutes. Tastes great with ice cream or whipping
cream, served warm.
