Title: Finger Juice
Categories: Microwave, Snacks
Yield: 8 servings
2 pk Gelatin, unflavored
2 c  Juice, apple
Any fruit juice can be substituted for the apple juice.

Microwave: In 1-qt square casserole, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over
juice; let stand 3 minutes.  Microwave at HIGH 1 minute; stir
thoroughly. Then microwave at HIGH 2 minutes.  Remove from microwave
and stir until gelatin is completely dissolved.  Chill in pan or mold
until firm, about 3 hours.  Cut into 1" squares.

Conventional: In medium saucepan, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over
juice and let stand 1 minute.  Stir over low heat until gelatin is
completely dissolved, about 5 minutes.  Pour into 1-qt square
casserole; chill and cut as above.

Jellosicles: prepare juice and gelatin as above.  After gelatin is
completely dissolved, pour juice into popsicle mold or small cups with
popsicle sticks in them, then freeze completely.  The gelatin keeps
it from dripping TOO much and makes the jellosicles easy for small
hands to grab.
