1 tb Onion juice

1/2 lb Bacon
1    Hard boiled egg
1    Head red lettuce
2 bn Of spinach
This is the first salad I ever tasted that I actually LIKED rather
than just endured.  And that was when I was in my early thirties!  I
got it from my cousin and she got it originally from Sunset Magazine
if I remember correctly.  At any rate it's excellent.  One of the few
salads that I consider a full meal in itself.  The dressing has
become my house dressing. I usually make a double recipe.  Keeps good
in the fridge.

Mix the dressing ingredients and set aside to blend flavors.  Clean
the spinach and lettuce and tear into pieces.  Fry the bacon crisp
and crumble it into not-too-small pieces.  Chop the egg coarsely.
Toss it all together and add dressing to taste.
