Roe Griffith of Kansas City gave me her favorite zucchini-relish
recipe, from her mother's family, the Maccans. Not I share it with
you to make and enjoy all summer long as a topping for burgers,
sandwiches and cold meats. This relish is so yummy and easy to make,
you'll want to keep some on hand all year long.

1. Place zucchini, onions and salt in a large bowl; mix well and
cover. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, place mixture in a fine
strainer. Drain well, rinse under cold water and drain again for 1
hour.

2. Place mixture in a heavy pot and remaining ingredients. Bring to a
boil and simmer, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes.

3. Cool completely and store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 4
weeks. Or sterilize 3 or 4 pint-sized canning jars in boiling water.
Fill with relish, seal and process in boiling water for 10 minutes.
Carefully remove jars with tongs. Let rest until relish comes to room
temperature. Store in cool, dark place for up to 6 months.
