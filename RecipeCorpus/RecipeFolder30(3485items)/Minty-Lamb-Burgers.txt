If you are tired of beef yet looking for a great-tasting burger,
here's a splendid choice, easily mixed up with lots of fresh mint,
onion and garlic. The fresh mint is essential for an exciting burst
of flavor in these luscious patties. Chop the leaves coarsely with a
good, sharp knife so that they will stay nice and green. For a
garnish, nothing goes better than plain yogurt and ripe tomato
slices. Drain the yogurt through a strainer lined with cheesecloth
for one hour before serving.

1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.

2. Place the ground lamb in a bowl and mix well with onion, garlic and
chopped mint, being sure not to overmix. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Gently form the mixture into 4 patties.

3. Grill the burgers over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 4
minutes per side for rare meat or 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.

4. Serve the lamb burgers immediately on buns topped with a tomato
slice and a dollop of yogurt, if desired.
