Title: Sauteed Greens for Piadini
Categories: Italian, Breads
Yield: 6 servings
Salt
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 tb Chopped garlic
Freshly ground pepper
1 lb Fresh spinach or Swiss chard
1/2 lb Broccoli top (cime di rapa)
-or other bitter greens
1 lb Head Savoy cabbage
Wash spinach and cime di rapa thoroughly.  Discard the darkest outer
leaves of the cabbage and cut off the stem; cut cabbage in quarters.

Bring 3 or 4 quarts of water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon salt and put
in the cime di rapa.  Cover loosely top and cook for 8 to 12 minutes.
Drain and set aside.

If using chard, cook in exactly the same manner, stalks included, but
in its own water.  The cabbage is cooked the same way, but without
salt, for 15 to 20 minutes.  If using spinach, cook in a covered pan
with just the water that clings to the leaves, adding salt to taste.
Cook until tender, drain, set aside.

Gently but firmly squeeze all the moisture you can out of all the
greens. Chop together, but not too fine.

Put oil and garlic in medium saute pan and saute over medium heat
until garlic becomes lightly colored.  Add chopped greens, turning
with a fork so they are evenly coated, seasoning with salt and
pepper. Saute about 10 minutes, turning frequently.  Taste and
correct seasoning.

Serve hot.

Serves 6.
