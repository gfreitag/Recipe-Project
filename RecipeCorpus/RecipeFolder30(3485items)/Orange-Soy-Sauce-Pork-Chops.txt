Title: Orange Soy Sauce Pork Chops
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Black pepper -- freshly
Ground
8    Sprigs thyme -- or 1/2 tsp
Dried
3 tb Olive oil
6    Pork chops -- 1 inch thick
11 oz Mandarin oranges in juice --
Drained
2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1    Clove garlic -- pressed
With a sharp knife, lightly score the pork chops in a crisscross
pattern on each side.  Place in a shallow bowl in a single layer.

In a food processor, blend the oranges to form a thick juice.  Add
the soy sauce sugar, garlic, pepper and thyme, and pulse to blend.
Pour the mixture over the chops, cover and let sit for at least 30
minutes. Drain and reserve the marinade.

Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet.  Add the chops and brown
on both sides over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and pour the
reserved marinade over the chops.  Cover and cook until the chops are
done, about 8-10 minutes.  Remove the chops to a heated platter.

Reduce the marinade in the skillet until it is thickened and syrupy.
Pour over the chops and serve immediately.
