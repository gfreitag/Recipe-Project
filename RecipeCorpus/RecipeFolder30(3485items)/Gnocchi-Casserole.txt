Title: Gnocchi Casserole
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 ds Cayenne
1 c  Cheddar cheese, grated
1    Egg, beaten with a fork
2 c  Milk, heated but NOT boiling
1/2 c  Cream of Wheat cereal
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Margerine, chopped
(editors note: this is a really impressive, fluffy and smooth side
dish for any roast.  It can be served with gravy or just butter.)

Place warm milk, cream of wheat, salt, margerine and cayenne in double
boiler, heat thoroughly until margerine is melted.  Stir often.

Remove from heat, add grated cheddar.

Add the egg. (I add 1 Tblsp of the warm mixture to the egg and stir
lightly, then another Tblsp and stir.  do this five times, then add
egg mixture to whole warm mixture.  This way you avoid danger of egg
curdling.)

Place in greased casserole and let stand at room temperature.

Bake at 350 for 1 hour until nice and brown on top.

Doubles quite nicely, but do not increase salt.
