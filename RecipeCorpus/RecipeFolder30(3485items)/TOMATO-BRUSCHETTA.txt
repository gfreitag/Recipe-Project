Yield: 6 servings
-taste
4 lg Large tomatoes diced
1/2 bn Basil (leaves only) chopped
6 pn Sea salt or more to taste
1    Loaf good quality Italian
-bread
2    To 3 garlic cloves peeled
8 tb Virgin olive oil or more to
Prepare a charcoal fire or heat a griller, setting the grill rack
about 10 cm from the heat.

Slice the bread on the diagonal, 1/2" thick.  The thickness of the
bread is important in this recipe.  We suggest 1/2" to 3/4" thick so
that the bread will be toasted on the outside but moist and chewy on
the inside. An average loaf should give you about 12 slices. Toast
both sides of each slice of bread, remove from the grill, and rub one
side of each slice with the garlic cloves.  The texture of the
toasted bread acts like sandpaper on the garlic, wearing it down so
that its pulp and juice fill the pores of the bread.  The more garlic
you rub into the bread, the stronger the flavour.

Drizzle the bread lavishly with olive oil, top each slice with the
tomato and basil, and sprinkle with sea salt.  Serve immediately.
