~-- Preheat oven to 325øF.  Remove the giblets from the bird.  Rub
the inside of the clean body cavity with salt until there is a
coating of salt over the whole inside.  This holds the juice inside
the bird and the salt will season your dressing. Even after cooking
most of the salt will remain inside of the body cavity. Place the
stuffing in the bird and close the body cavity.  Melt the butter and
add the orange juice.  Baste the bird with the butter/orange juice
mixture.  Place a meat thermometer between the thigh and body in the
meaty part of the thigh, not touching any bone. Bake the bird until
the thermometer reads 190øF, basting frequently.  When the skin turns
golden brown, tent the bird with a large sheet of aluminum foil.
Allow the bird to cool while making gravy, then carve and serve a
moist holiday tradition.  If you use an aluminum baking pan it will
add about one hour to the baking time.  If a moist turkey is what you
want, give this method a try.  I have not had any problems with using
the excess salt and I have a problem with too much salt.  From: Syd's
