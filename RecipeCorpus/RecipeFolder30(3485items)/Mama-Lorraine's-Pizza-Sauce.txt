This comes from the true article:  the mother of a girlfriend of
mine. The romance ended a long time ago, but I'm still welcome
whenever I come to Bellingham.  (In fact, they rather *insist* and
get very offended if they learn I've been and don't show.)  This is
the best pizza that I've ever had.  And yes, you're reading the time
on the sauce right. 6 HOURS...not a second less. (Please also note
that there are no measurements with the spices.  What do you expect
from a good Italian grandmama anyway????)

In a very large saucepan, add 3 T olive oil and heat.

Add onions and garlic.  Saute to golden.

Add paste with 1 can water, mix well and bring to boil, then add
tomatos (mashed a little).  Bring to second boil.  Keep stirring.

Add wine and salt and pepper along with cans of sauce.  Put Tabasco
and taco mix in too.  Bring to boil.

If sauce seems a little too thick, either add water (1/2 to 1 cup) or
wine (preferably half and half).  Mix in ground cloves.  Add
mushrooms. Cover, reduce heat to low.  Simmer 6 hrs.

Tastes best after re-heating; freezable.  Enough for a week's worth of
Italian food.
