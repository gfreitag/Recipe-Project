Title: Orange-Almond Snails
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 4 dozen
2 c  Ground almonds
2/3 c  Sugar, plus additional for
Coating
2 tb Finely grated orange zest
1/2 ts Almond extract
1 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
1/3 c  Powdered sugar
9 tb Unsalted butter, cold, cut
Into pieces
1    Egg
1 tb Water (or as needed)
Process the flour, powdered sugar and butter in a food processor
fitted with a steel blade until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Add the egg and with the machine running, add 1 T water by drops just
until the dough starts to gather into a ball.  Do not overprocess.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours.  Place the
almonds, 2/3 c sugar the orange zest and almond extract in the food
processor. Process to a coarse paste.  Divide the dough in half and
roll out each half on a floured surface into a rectangle about 1/8"
thick. Sprinkle the almond filling evenly over the dough rectangles.
Using a rolling pin, press the filling firmly into the dough.  Roll
up the dough like a jelly roll, starting from a long edge and rolling
as tightly as possible. Freeze the rolls on trays for 15 minutes so
that they will be easier to slice. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly grease cookie sheets. Cut the rolls with a sharp knife into
1/4" slices and place on the cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.
Immediately remove the cookies to wire racks to cool.  When cooled to
room temperature, roll each cookie in a shallow bowl of sugar to coat
evenly. From The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook by Julee Russo &
