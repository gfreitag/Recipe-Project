Categories: Homestyle

Sugar
Grapes
Pick grapes from stalks. Crush and place over a slow fire till juice
runs freely. Strain through a fine cloth or jelly bag, squeezing out
all the juice. Measure. For each quart of juice, use 1 1/2 cups
sugar. Scald juice, add sugar, boil 5 minutes after the sugar is
melted. Bottle and seal.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
