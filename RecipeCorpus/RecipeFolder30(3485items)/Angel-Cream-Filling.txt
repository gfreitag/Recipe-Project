Title: Angel Cream Filling
Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Flour
1/4 c  Crisco shortening
1 ts Vanilla (white)
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter or oleo
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
Blend milk and flour together in pan until smooth. Cook until
mixture thickens; cool.  Cream remaining ingredients and combine the
two mixtures.

Beat until fluffy.

The fluffiest filling can be obtained by adding 3 tbs. of merengue
powder, and beating at highest speed with a PADDLE type beater, such
as on Kitchen Aid mixers.

Rotary type beaters are really not satisfactory for this kind of
work. Submitted By BILL SPALDING   On   04-26-95
