Mix together either set of five spices in equal quantities.

Panch Phora needn't be ground; more often than not it isn't, but one
or two teaspoons are added to chopped or diced vegetables. The usual
method is to slice an onion or two finely, fry in fat, add vegetables
and panch phora, cover with water then simmer till the vegetables are
soft. Then eat with either rice or poorees, with or without pickle or
chutney. Panch phora, if added to stews or plain boiled vegetables,
will give them a distinctive aroma and a pleasant unusual flavour.
Many who never accustom themselves either to the richness or pungency
of curries like the addition of panch phora to their food. Taken from
