MMMMM----------------------ALMONDEGOS SOUP---------------------------
Put a knuckle of veal and calf's foot into two quarts of water, with
ablade of mace and a bunch of sweet herbs, a turnip, a little white
pepper, and salt; when sufficiently done, strain and skim it, and add
balls of forced meat, and egg balls. A quarter of an hour before
serving beat up the yolks of four eggs with a dessert spoonful of
lemon juice, and three ounces of sweet almonds blanched and beaten
with a spoonful of podered white sugar. This mixture is to be stirred
into the soup, till it thickens, taking care to prevent its curdling.
