Here's what I've done a time or four. This "recipe" has not been
cooked often enough to be stabilized and really called a recipe.
Still, there have been no complaints and many requests for seconds.

A tsp to a Tbsp or so of the following (to taste): Onion powder Garlic
powder (NOT garlic salt) Ground black pepper Ground red pepper
(cayenne) Ground white pepper Basil Parsley Paprika Oregano Spaghetti

Put the chicken into a crockpot early in the day.  It's fine if they
are still frozen.  Add as little liquid as possible. Water, chicken
stock, or a bit of white vermouth, or a combination works fine.  Add
a couple of bay leaves, and some salt.  Turn the crockpot on low and
go to work (or carry on your normal day's activities.

When you get home, or in the evening, turn off the crockpot.  Put
water  on to boil the spaghetti.  Remove chicken from the crockpot
and discard skin and bones.

In a deep pot, heat olive oil.  Add onion and garlic and cook until
the onions are clear. Add tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, tomato
puree, the chicken and about a cup of the chicken broth from the
crockpot.  (If you add too much broth, the sauce will be too soupy;
if you add too little, the chicken taste will be a bit weak.)  Stir,
cutting up the whole tomatoes. Add celery, onion powder, garlic
powder, peppers, basil, parsley, paprika, and oregano.  Cook,
stirring from time to time, while the water for the spaghetti comes
to a boil.  Cook spaghetti, drain and serve with grated Parmesan
cheese on the side.
