Preheat oven to 350 F. To make topping: Melt butter in a saucepan and
add brown sugar. Cook over a low flame until well blended, then stir
in crushed pineapple. Pour about a tsp of this topping into the
bottom of each greased miniature muffin cup and add a sliver of red
cherry. (See Note)

To prepare batter: Cream butter, add sugar, and beat until fluffy.
Beat egg yolk and add. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together;
add alternately with the pineapple juice. Stir in vanilla. Beat egg
white until stiff and fold into batter. Pour batter over topping,
filling each cup 2/3 full, and bake for 25 mins, or until cupcakes
pull away from sides of pan and turn golden on top. Cool, then turn
cupcakes carefully onto a cake plate, pineapple side up.

Note: The topping can be poured into a 9-inch skillet, using 5
pineapple rings instead of the crushed pineapple.
