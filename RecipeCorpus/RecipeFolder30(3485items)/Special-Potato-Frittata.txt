A while back Earl was kind enough to send me a cookbook he authored.

It's a small paperback on camp cooking that has both tips on things
like how to avoid eating freeze dried noodles and grayling for six
days straight and recipes tailored for the camp cook.  Since I go
camping about once every other decade, I don't think I'll wait to try
the following...

Here is a breakfast better than many get at home.  With the cheese and
seasonings, it makes getting up in the morning a pleasure.

Melt butter with oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Mix potatoes and
flour.  Add potato, paprika, garlic powder and Italian seasoning to
skillet and cook until potatoes are just tender, stirring often for
10 minutes. Combine eggs with parmesan cheese in medium bowl.  Season
with salt and pepper.  Pour egg mixture over potatoes.  Pierce holes
in egg mixture and lift edges with spatula, tipping pan to allow
uncooked egg to flow under, until edge forms, about one minute; do
not stir. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet and continue until eggs
are set.
