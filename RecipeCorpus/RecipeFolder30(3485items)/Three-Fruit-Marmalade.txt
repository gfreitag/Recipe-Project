Title: Three-Fruit Marmalade
Categories: Can/preserv, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1    Lemon
Sugar -- as needed
1    Grapefruit
1    Orange
Grate about a quarter of the rind of each fruit. Then slice each
fruit in half (including remaining rinds). Remove and discard seeds
and white fibrous centers. Slice half of each fruit as thinly as
possible through the rind and pulp. Peel the rind off the remaining
halves and cut in thin, narrow strip; chop the fruit pulp. Place all
fruit and rind in a bowl; cover with cold water and let stand
overnight. The next day, boil rapidly for a half hour in the same
water. Cover and again let stand overnight. Measure fruit and its
liquid and for each cupful add 1 cup sugar. Return to stove and boil
rapidly for about 45 mins, stirring often. Toward the end of cooking
time, test frequently, until marmalade jells, by dropping a small
amount on a cold dish. Runniness indicates that marmalade needs to
cook a little longer. Place in half-pint jars. To seal, process in
simmering water for 10 mins. Yield: about 2 pints or 4 half-pints.
