Title: Kielbasa (Barry Strittmatter 1)
Categories: Homemade, Sausage, Meats
Yield: 24 servings
MMMMM----------------FROM : BARRY STRITTMATTER, D---------------------
1 ts Allspice
4 ea Tb Garlic
4 lb Pork
2 lb Pork fat
2 lb Beef
8 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
4 ts Pepper
4 ts Majoram
1 ts Nutmeg
Combine pork, fat, and beef.  Add all spices and mix well by hand.
Pass through grinder on course blade.  Stuff into casings.
(hint.++After cubing meat, place in freezer until the center of the
meat and fat is firm. This makes grinding easier in that it lessens
the blades from becoming "clogged")  Most Kielbasa recipes say that
the secret to making good Kielbasa is to ground the meat twice.  I
prefer the course texture attained by a single grinding.  Other
sausages I grind twice.
