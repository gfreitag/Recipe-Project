Title: Chicken Breasts with Tomato Sauce
Categories: Poultry, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Butter
TOMATO SAUCE:
2 c  Canned tomatoes, preferably
-imported
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1 ts Finely minced garlic
4    Skinless, boneless chicken
-breast (1 1/2 Lb)
Salt to taste, if desired
Freshly ground black pepper
2    Eggs
1 tb Finely chopped fresh
-rosemary (or 1/2 Tbl dried)
2 tb Water
1/2 c  Flour
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Tomato Sauce:  Blend the tomatoes thoroughly in a food processor or
blender.  Heat the oil in a saucepan; add the onion and garlic.  Cook
briefly, stirring.  Add the tomatoes and seasonings and bring to a
boil. Simmer for about 20 minutes.

Split the chicken breasts down the center.  Trim off and discard fat
and membranes.  Pound each chicken breast half lightly with a flat
mallet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and add the rosemary, water, salt,
and pepper.  Beat well.  Coat the chicken pieces with the flour and
shake off the excess.  Heat the oil and butter in a large, heavy
skillet.  As the oil heats, dip the chicken pieces in the egg
mixture.  Coat well and allow the excess to drip off.

When the oil and butter are hot add half of the chicken pieces and
cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes on one side, until golden
brown. Turn the chicken and continue cooking about for 2 minutes on
the second side. The total cooking time for each piece should be 5 to
6 minutes. Remove the cooked chicken to a warm platter and cook the
remaining pieces.

Serve the chicken hot with the tomato sauce on the side.

Yield: 4 servings.
