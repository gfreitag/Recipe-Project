Title: French Pancakes^
Categories: Pcake/waffl, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Milk
Fruit preserves
Powdered sugar
1 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs, beaten
Add eggs and milk to sifted flour, salt and baking powder. Beat well,
being careful there are no lumps. Melt a teaspoon of butter in a
skillet. When pan is hot enough, pour in enough batter to just cover
the bottom. Cook until golden brown, turn. Spread with fruit, roll up
and sprinkle with powdered sugar just before serving. Many of the
recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
