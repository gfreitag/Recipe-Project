* One 2-pound to 2-1/2 pound boneless top sirloin steak about 2 inches
thick, cut with a pocket for stuffing, or two 1-pound to 1-1/2 pound
steaks of similar shape, each about 1-inch thick.

About 1 to 2 hours before you plan to barbecue, combine the dry
rub ingredients together in a small bowl. Rub the steak well with the
mixture inside and out. Wrap the steak in plastic and refrigerate it.
Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200
degrees F to 220 degrees F.
About 20 minutes before barbecuing, remove the meat from the
refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature.
To make the filling, break the garlic bulb apart and squeeze each
soft clove from its skin.
In a small skillet, heat the butter with the anchovy paste. Add
the garlic, mashing it with a fork to form a rough puree. Stir in the
green onions and wine, and cook a minute or two, until the onions are
limp. Remove the pan from the heat and let the filling cool briefly.
Spoon the filling into the pocket of the sirloin or, if you are using
two individual steaks, layer the filling on one steak and top it with
the other. It is not necessary (or desirable) to secure the pair with
toothpicks as long as you handle the sirloin 'sandwich' with care.
If you plan to baste the meat, stir together the mop ingredients
in a small saucepan and warm over low heat.
In a heavy skillet, sear the sirloin quickly on both sides over
high heat. Transfer the meat to the smoker and cook for about 1-3/4
hours, depending upon your desired doneness. Mop every 30 minutes in a
wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for your style of smoker. We
prefer the meat when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F
to 150 degrees F, or medium rare. Let the meat sit for 5 minutes and
serve.

Note from JP: try putting a couple of small onions in water pan.
