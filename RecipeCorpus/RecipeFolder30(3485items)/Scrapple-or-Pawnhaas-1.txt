of pork for several hours.  Remove the meat from bones and grind.

To make the scrapple:

Bring the broth to a boil.  Into it dribble cornmeal, stirring

Cook slowly in a heavy kettle or double-boiler, stirring constantly
for the first 15 minutes and then frequently for a half hour.  Pour
into loaf pans about three inches deep and keep in a cool place.  To
serve, slice 1/4 inch thick and fry in hot fat until brown on both
sides.
