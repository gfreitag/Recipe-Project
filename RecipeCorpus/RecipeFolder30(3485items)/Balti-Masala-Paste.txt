Title: Balti Masala Paste
Categories: Herbs/spice, ', Indian, Balti
Yield: 675 servings
3/4 c  Vegetable oil
1    Recipe Balti masala Mix
3/4 c  Vinegar; eny type
Place the ground masala spices in a bowl. Add the vinegar and enough
water to make a creamy paste. Leave to stand for at least 10 minutes.
**

Heat the oil in a karahi or wok. Add the paste to the oil. It will
splatter a bit so be careful.

Stir fry the paste continually to prevent it sticking until the water
content is cooked out (it should take about 5 minutes). As the liquid
is reduced, the paste will begin to make a regular bubbling noise
(hard to describe, but it goes chup-chup-chup-chup) if you don't
stir, and it will splatter. this is your audible cue that it is ready.

you can tell if the spices are cooked by taking the karahi off the
stove. Leave it to stand for 3-4 mins. If the oil "floats" to the
top, the spices are cooked. If not, add a little more oil and carry
on cooking and stirring. ++

Bottle the paste in sterilised jars. Then heat up a little more oil
and 'cap' off the paste by pouring in enough oil to cover. Seal the
jars and store.

NB ** When I tried this recipe I used volumes instead of weights, and
found that I had FAR too much liquid and oil. Beware of the
quantities therefore, and be prepared to add your liquids in two or
three batches just in case. IMH

++ I found it very hard to judge the stage of doneness and nearlyv
burned the paste. This wasn't helped by the fact that I had far too
much oil for the spices. IMH
