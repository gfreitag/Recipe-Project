To cook the crepes: place all the ingredients in a food processor and
process until the mixture is thin and smooth.  Refrigerate for 30
minutes. Pour a thin layer of the batter into a 22cm lightly oiled
crepe pan and cook quickly over medium high heat until the crepe is
lightly coloured underneath and set on top.  Turn and cook until the
other side is lightly coloured.  Remove the crepe and cook the
remaining batter, stacking the crepes, with a piece of grease- proof
paper between every second crepe. To cook the lime curd: place all
the ingredients, except the butter, in the top of a double saucepan
and whisk gently over simmering water until the mixture thickens.
Beat in the butter and set aside to cool. To serve: when the crepes
are cool cut each in half and place a slice of the mango and a
teaspoon of the lime curd on each half. Fold the crepe over and tuck
the ends under spoon of sugar on each bundle and place the bundles on
a greased oven tray under a hot griller until the sugar is
caramelised. Serve immediately with a chilled zabaglione (recipe
follows) on the side. Loise Lechte. Bon Appetit, Exec. Chef Magnus
