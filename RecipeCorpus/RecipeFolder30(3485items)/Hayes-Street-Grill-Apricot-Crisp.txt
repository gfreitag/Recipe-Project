Adapted from "A Taste of San Francisco", Doubleday, 1990.

Preheat oven to 375F.  Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan or shallow,
round baking dish with a little of the butter.

Toss the fruit in lemon juice and granulated sugar to taste.  Pile
into a baking dish.

Combine the flour, remaining butter, brown sugar, salt and cinnamon
in a bowl.  Rub together with fingertips until the mixture is
crumbly. Sprinkle on top of the fruit.

Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the fruit is bubbly around the edges
and the top has browned.  Allow to cool briefly; serve while still
warm, with whipped cream, creme fraiche or ice cream.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
