Title: Sharbate Beh (Quince Sherbet Drink)
Categories: Middle east, Beverages, Fruit
Yield: 3 cups
1/2 c  Lemon juice, fresh
2 1/2 c  Sugar
2 md Quinces, fresh; about 1 lb.
3 1/2 c  Water, cold
2 tb Lemon juice, fresh
With a small, sharp knife remove the skins from the quinces.  Slice
each fruit lengthwise into quarters and cut out the seeds and cores.
Combine 2 cups of the water and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice in a
bowl and, using the fine side of a stand up hand grater, grate the
quinces into the lemon water mixture to prevent their discoloring.
Drain the grated quince in a fine sieve, then wrap it in a double
thickness of cheesecloth and squeeze vigorously over a bowl to wring
out as much juice as possible before discarding the pulp.
In a 2 to 3 quart enameled or stainless steel saucepan, bring the
remaining 1 « cups of water and the sugar to a boil over moderate
heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Increase the heat to high
and cook briskly, uncovered and undisturbed, for 5 minutes, or until
the syrup reaches a temperature of 220 degrees on a candy
thermometer. Add the quince juice and the remaining « cup of lemon
juice and, stirring frequently, simmer over low heat for 5 minutes
more. Pour the syrup into a bowl and cool to room temperature.
For each serving, pour « cup of the syrup into a tumbler or highball
glass.  Stir in « cup of cold water, then fill the glass with crushed
or shaved ice.
