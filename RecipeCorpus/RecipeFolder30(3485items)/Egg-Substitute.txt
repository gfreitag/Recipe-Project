Title: Egg Substitute
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Water
1 ts Cornstarch +
Substitute 1 t cornstarch for each omitted egg, adding 3 T water for
each t cornstarch.

This was tried on several different brands of cake mix including one
which called for 3 eggs.  There was a slight change of texture,
depending on the brand used.  (One was slightly dry and crumbly, and
another was super moist and tendewr.)  When you need to substitute
only one egg, there is no discernible change.

Naturally, this will not work with chiffon, sponge or angel food cake
when the whipped volume of the eggs is essential.
