Title: Buttermilk Wheat Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 loaves
2 ts Salt
3 tb Butter, melted
2 1/2 c  Whole-Wheat Flour
3 1/2 c  Flour,unbleached bread
2 ts Active Dry Yeast
1/2 c  Water, warm
3/4 c  Water, very hot
1/4 c  Honey
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk, cold
Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let proof for about 5
:
minutes.
Mix the hot water with the honey and butter and add the
:
buttermilk. The temperature should be just slightly warm.
Stir the flour and salt together, making a well in the
:
center. Pour the yeast and buttermilk mixtures into the well and
incorporate the flour well. The bread is lightest if the dough is
slightly soft. Knead for about 20 minutes. Form the dough into a ball
and place it smooth side up in a slightly greased bowl and cover and
let rise.
After about an hour and a half, gently poke the center of the
:
dough with a wet finger about 1/2 inch deep. If the hole doesn't fill
in at all or if the dough sighs, it is ready for the next step.
Press flat, form into a smooth round, and let the dough rise
:
once more as before. The second rising will take about half as much
time as the first.
Press the dough flat and divide in two. Round it and let it
:
rest until relaxed. Then deflate and shape into two loaves and place
into your loaf pans. Cover and let rise again until the dough slowly
returns a gentle fingerprint. This dough makes a very high loaf when
properly kneaded, so be a little bold about giving it time.
Bake the bread in a preheated 325 degree oven for 55 minutes.

Brush the loaves with melted butter while still in the pans and allow
