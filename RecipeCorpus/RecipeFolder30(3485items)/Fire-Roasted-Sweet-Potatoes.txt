Categories: Side dish, Bbq/grill, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
Soy sauce, as needed
4 sm Sweet potatoes, washed
2 oz Sesame seeds, toasted
Prick the sweet potatoes with a fork to prevent them from exploding
while cooking.  Wrap in foil individually.  Place in the white hot
coals of the barbeque for about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on the

Alternatively, leave unwrapped & grill slowly over grill over the hot
