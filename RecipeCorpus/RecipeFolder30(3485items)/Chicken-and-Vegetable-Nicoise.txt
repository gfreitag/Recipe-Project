2. Combine vegetables, garlic and 2 teaspoons parsley in a bowl. Toss
with 1 teaspoon olive oil, salt and pepper.

3. Take a large, heavy piece of aluminum foil, about 18" long, and
fold in half crosswise. Place the chicken breast half in center of
one side of the foil. Brush with remaining 1/2 teaspoon olive oil and
sprinkle with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Surround with the
seasoned vegetables.

4. Fold remaining half of foil over chicken and vegetables. Crimp
edges together to make a tightly sealed packet. Place on a baking
sheet and bake in center of the preheated oven for 20 minutes.

5. Place cooked pasta on a dinner plate or in a shallow bowl. Serve
chicken and vegetables atop pasta. Sprinkle with remaining teaspoon
of parsley. Serve with a lemon wedge alongside.
