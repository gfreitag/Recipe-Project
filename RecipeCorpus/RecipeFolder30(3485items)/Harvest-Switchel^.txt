Title: Harvest Switchel^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Ginger
1 ga Water
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Molasses
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
Mix sugar, molasses, vinegar and ginger in 1 quart water; heat until
dissolved. Add remaining water and chill. Serve cold! Switchel is
especially thirst quenching, so be sure to have plenty ready when it's
haying time and the men are hot and sweaty. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
