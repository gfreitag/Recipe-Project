Title: Creamed Chicken on Cornbread
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Cooked cubed chicken (I used
-a pound of
Skinned and boned chicken
-breast)
A little grated cheddar
-cheese (I used colby)
1    Recipe cornbread (use your
-favorite)
2 tb Butter, margarine or
-vegetable oil
2 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup (but
-I used cream of
Chicken, which was just as
-tasty)
Start your cornbread and get it in the oven. Cook your chicken breast
cubes if they weren't already cooked.

Melt the butter in a large frypan. Add flour and stir til pasty. Add
milk. Stir til thick and bubbly. Add cream of mushroom soup and heat
until hot and thick. Add chicken and heat up.

Slice cornbread into sixths. Then cut each sixth in half, and pour
creamy chicken mixture over the cornbread halves. Sprinkle with
cheese. Serve with a vegetable (I served peas in lemon butter).

My family loved it...even Miss Picky-Picky Kristin! :)
