Categories: Middle east, Greek, Desserts, Cake/cookie
Yield: 24 cookies
1 ts Baking powder, double acting
2 1/4 c  Flour, all purpose
1/4 c  Walnuts; finely chopped
1/2 lb Butter; melted and cooled
2 tb Sugar, confectioners
1/2 c  Sugar, confectioners
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  In a large mixing bowl,
combine the melted butter, 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the baking
powder and stir together with a large spoon.  Sift in the flour about
1/4 cup at a time beating well after each addition, then stir in the
walnuts.
On a lightly floured surface, pat 2 tablespoons of dough at a time
into round cakes about 1 « inches in diameter and « inch thick. Shape
into triangles by pinching and pulling out the sides of each cake
with your thumbs and forefingers.  If you prefer "S" shaped cookies,
roll about 2 tablespoons of the dough at a time into ropes about 6
inches long and 1/4 inch in diameter, and twist them one at a time
into S shapes. Place the cookies about 1 inch apart on a large baking
sheet and bake in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes, or until
they are lightly browned and firm to the touch.
Cool the cookies on a rack.  Just before serving, sprinkle the
cookies with the remaining « cup of confectioners sugar.
