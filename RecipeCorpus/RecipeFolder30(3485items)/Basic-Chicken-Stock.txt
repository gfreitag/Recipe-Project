Title: Basic Chicken Stock
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
4    Fresh Parsley Sprigs
4    Cloves
4    Black Peppercorns
1 ts Thyme, Dried, Crumbled
1    Bay Leaf
4 lb Chicken Wings
4    Cold Water
3    Stalks Celery, Sliced
1    Onion, Sliced
1    Carrot, Sliced
Combine chicken wings and 4 quarts water in heavy large pot. Bring to
boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15
minutes, skimming foam from surface.  Add remaining ingredients to
pot; simmer 2 hours. Strain stock, lightly pressing on solids to
release all liquid. Chill stock until cold and fat on top is solid,
at least 6 hours and up to 2 days. Discard fat. Boil stock in heavy
medium saucepan over high heat until reduced to 8 cups, about 30
minutes.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Cover and refrigerate 2 days or
freeze up to 6 months.) Makes 8 cups. Recipe from Bon Appetit, March,
1993 - from Jim Fobel, whose most recent book is "The Whole Chicken
Cookbook" (Ballantine, 1992). Note from me: We usually freeze our
stock in ice trays until frozen; then we put in large zip lock
freezer bag, labeled for storage.  We know that approximately 7 stock
"cubes" equal one cup of stock, so it makes it easy to pop out a few
when cooking, or take out a measured amount for a recipe. Sure is
nicer to have your own *unsalted* stock to use instead of the canned,
which is so hard to find with little or no salt.  We also make our
own garlic broth and store it the same way, and occasionally make our
own beef broth.  Whenever we make a smoked turkey (and can resist
using the carcass for gumbo), we make turkey stock, too. Source: Bon
