warm water to come halfway up the sides of the smaller pan. Divide
grits among artichoke hearts. Bake for 20 minutes.

For mango butter, in a saucepan, place wine, vinegar, shallots and bay
leaf. Reduce over medium-high heat until 1 tablespoon of liquid
remains. Add cream. Simmer 2 minutes, then remove bay leaf. Whisk in
butter and mango puree. Strain. Add cheese, salt and pepper. Serve
stuffed artichokes warm topped with lobster pieces and a few
spoonsful of mango butter.
