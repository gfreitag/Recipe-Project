Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Indian, Balti
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Balti chicken stock -=OR=-
Water
1 tb Balti garam masala
1 tb Coriander (cilantro) fresh
-very finely chopped
Aromatic salt; to taste
1 1/2 lb Skinned and boned chicken
-meat, weighed AFTER dis-
-carding unwanted matter
3 tb Ghee or corn oil  **
4    Garlic cloves; fine chopped
1 c  Onion; finely chopped
4 tb Balti masala paste
**Ghee is clarified butter - made by heating unsalted butter gently
till the froth starts to subside, allowing to settle, skimming and
decanting from deposited casein.

Cut the chicken into 3cm cubes (1.5"). Prepare aromatic ingredients -
balti spices, onions, garlic and coriander.

Heat the ghee or oil in a karahi or wok (or very large frying pan) on
high heat, then stir fry the garlic for 30 seconds. Add the onion,
reduce the heat and stir fry for about 10 minutes, allowing the onion
to become translucent and begin to brown.

Add the masala paste and the chicken. Raise the heat again and bring
to a brisk sizzle, stir frying as needed for about 5 minutes. Add
about a cupful of stock or water, and simmerm stirring, on a lower
heat for about 10 minutes.

Test that the chicken is done by removing a piece and cutting it in
two. If there is any trace of pink, replace the halves in the pan and
continue cooking. When cooked as you like it, add the garam masala,
coriander leaves and salt to taste.

Note: this recipe can be used for any boneless poultry or feathered
game. Adjust times accordingly; duck, for instance, will take about
20 minutes longer than chicken or turkey.
