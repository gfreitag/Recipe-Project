Title: Peachy Mustard Baby Back Ribs
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Minced garlic
Salt and pepper to taste
2    Racks baby back ribs, about
-2 pounds, each
1/3 c  Honey mustard
3 tb Peach preserves
3 tb Peanut oil
3 tb Lemon juice
Baby back ribs are cut from the back rib section of the pig, and the
meat on them is as tender as a center-cut pork chop.  For that
reason, they can be grilled fairly quickly without any precooking.

Mix mustard with the peach preserves, peanut oil, lemon juice,
garlic, salt and pepper.  Marinate the ribs in this mixture for at
least 30 minutes.

Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white hot, or preheat a gas
grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.

Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals.  They will take
about 6 minutes per side.  Be careful, this sweet sauce burns easily.

Serves 4.
