This steamed egg dish exemplifies the simplicity of Chinese home
cooking it takes about 5 minutes to prepare.  The Chinese use a heat-
proof porcelain shallow bowl 7 inches wide by 3 inches deep with
sloping sides to steam this egg dish.  A 1 quart ceramic souffle dish
or a Pyrex bowl works just as well.  To ensure a smooth, silky
texture, avoid high heat when steaming.

Combine the clam juice, chicken broth, oil, wine, soy sauce, sugar and
pepper in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Remove from heat; cool
completely.

Lightly beat the eggs in bowl.  Slowly stir the cooled broth mixture
into the eggs until thoroughly mixed.  Avoid over-beating.

Scatter the clams and 2 tablespoons of the chives in the bottom of a
1quart heat-proof bowl.  Strain the egg mixture through a fine mesh
sieve over the clams.

Bring the water in a steamer to a boil over high heat.  Place the
bowl on a rack above the boiling water.  Cover, reduce heat to a
gentle boil, and steam for 2 minutes, or until the eggs begin to set.

Carefully remove cover from steamer, and scatter the shrimp on top of
the custard.  Cover and steam for 5 minutes longer, The custard is
done when a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.

Carefully remove bowl from the steamer.  Drizzle with oyster sauce and
garnish with remaining chives.  Spoon over rice.  Serve hot.

Serves 4 to 6.
