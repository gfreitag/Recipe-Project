Everyone has banana bread recipes, but this one uses buttermilk which
I thought was interesting.

Banana bread is made all over the Northern Hemisphere but this recipe
is from the South.

Combine flour, soda and salt in a mixing bowl.  Cream butter with
sugar and beat in eggs with bananas, buttermilk and vanilla.  Stir
into dry ingredients and fold in nuts.  Spoon into a greased 9 x
5-inch pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for about an hour, or
until bread tests done in the center.

Makes 1 loaf.

From the San Francisco Chronicle, 11/16/88.
