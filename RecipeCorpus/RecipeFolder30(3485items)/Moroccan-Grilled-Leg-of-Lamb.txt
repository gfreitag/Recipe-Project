The grilled lamb is served with a trio of condiments which can also be
eaten with the grilled fish, for non meat-eating guests. 1 leg of
lamb, about 2.25kg, boned or 'butterflied' and gently pounded to
about 2.5cm thick Chermoula seasoning mixture made by combining the
following in a food processor 1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
1-2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped 4 tablespoons chopped
flat-leaf parsley 4 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves 1/4
teaspoon powdered saffron (you could substitute turmeric) 1 teaspoon
freshly ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon chilli
powder 6 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons lemon juice Process the
chermoula seasoning ingredients until the mix forms a smoothish
paste. It will keep for a couple of days in the refriger- ator but I
prefer, if making it in advance, to leave out the onion until it is
to be used. Rub the chermoula mixture well into both sides of the
lamb, cover and marinate for two hours at room temperature or
overnight in the refrigerator. Roast at 200Ã¸C for about 40 minutes,
turning the meat halfway through the time. This will give pink meat.
Finish with the skin side of the leg and put under a grill quickly at
the end if it is not nicely browned. Serves 6. Serve with Couscous
and Harissa, Preserved Lemons and Coriander and Mint Relish. (From
Taste of Morocco, Robert Carrier, London 1987.)
