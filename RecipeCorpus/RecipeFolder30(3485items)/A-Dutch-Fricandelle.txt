MMMMM--------------------A DUTCH FRICANDELLE-------------------------
Take two pounds of dressed fish, remove the skin and bones, cut in
small pieces with two or three anchovies and season well, soak the
crumb of a French roll in milk, beat it up with the fish and three
eggs: butter a mould, sprinkle it with raspings, place in the fish
and bake it; when done, turn out and serve either dry or with anchovy
sauce; if served dry, finely grated crumbs of bread should be
sprinkled thickly over it, and it should be placed a few minutes
before the fire to brown it. From: The Jewish Manual by "A Lady".
