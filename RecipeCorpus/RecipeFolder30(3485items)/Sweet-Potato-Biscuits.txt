Title: Sweet Potato Biscuits
Categories: Breads, Homemade
Yield: 12 servings
ds Ground Cinnamon
1/2 c  Melted Butter
1 c  Sweet Potatoes, Boiled,
Peeled, Mashed
2/3 c  Buttermilk
2 c  All-Purpose Flour -- sifted
3 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Baking Soda
3/4 ts Salt
3 tb Brown Sugar
Preheat oven to 425 F. Sift together dry ingredients and set aside.
Using a medium-size bowl, beat melted butter into sweet potato. Add
dry ingredients, a little at a time, stirring; alternating with
buttermilk. Mix just well enough to moisten through. Form into a ball
and turn out onto a lightly floured board. Lightly pat top side with
flour as well, since this is a sticky dough. Roll out to 1/2- to
3/4-inch thickness with a floured rolling pin. Cut with a floured
biscuit cutter. Bake for 20 to 25 mins or until lightly browned.

Yield: 12 to 14 biscuits
