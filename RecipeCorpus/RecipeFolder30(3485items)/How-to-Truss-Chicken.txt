Prepare chicken for roasting.  Draw skin of neck smoothly over back.
Fold wing tips under.  Press wings and legs against body. Thread a
large needle with white twine.  Use double.  Press needle through one
wing at middle joint, through end of neck skin, and through second
wing at middle joint. Pull cord firmly under breast and up across
legs and thighs. Draw the legs close together, covering the opening
made for drawing the fowl. Cross the string over the legs and tie
them to the tail.  Skewers may be used to hold wings and legs against
body.  If desired, the wings may be folded tightly in position over
the folded neck skin and the legs slipped through the vent opening.
