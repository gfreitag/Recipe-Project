until top is golden brown. Serve warm with sauce.

For the Whiskey Sauce:

Cream butter and sugar over medium heat until all butter is absorbed.
Remove from heat and blend in egg yolks.  Pour in bourbon gradually
to your own taste, stirring constantly.  Sauce will thicken as it
cools.  Serve warm over warm bread pudding.

NOTE: For a variety of sauces, just substitute your favorite fruit
juice or liqueur to complement your bread pudding.

Entered by Dale & Gail Shipp, Columbia Md. Personal note: Went to a
cooking class here and they prepared this recipe except that they
added drained canned peaches to the bread and used a peach liqueur
instead of whiskey for the sauce.  It was superb.
