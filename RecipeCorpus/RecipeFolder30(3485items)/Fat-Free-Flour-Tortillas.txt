Tucsonan R.D. Skinner has recently put out a new cookbook, "R.D.
Skinner's Best in Fat-Free Cooking." The book is not yet available in
major book stores, but can be ordered by calling (602) 797-7832.
Here's a sample from the book.

In large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well. Add
fat-free mayonnaise and use pastry blender (or fork) and blend until
flour mixture appears to be coarse throughout.

Add hot water and stir well. Knead in extra flour. Cover and allow to
stand for 10 minutes.

Set iron griddle over medium to medium-high heat. Tear off a piece of
dough, roll into a ball (approximately 2 1/2").

On well-floured board, roll dough out into a circular flat form as
thin as possible (less than 1/8" thickness) approximately 6" in
diameter. Add more flour if dough is sticky. Place tortilla on heated
griddle and allow it to bubble slightly. heat for approximately 1-2
minutes.

Flip tortilla and brown other side approximately 1 minute longer. If
tortilla has browned in variable spots and does not have a dough-like
texture, then it is done.
