Categories: Cheese/eggs, Hot/spicy
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
1 tb White vinegar
8    Eggs
Warm pita bread
1 c  Plain yogurt
2 lg Garlic cloves, pressed
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
12    Sage leaves, fresh
1/2 ts Paprika
Stir yogurt and garlic in a small bowl to blend. Season to taste with
salt & pepper. Divide mixture equally among 4 plates, spreading to
coat the center of each plate.

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add sage leaves,
paprika, and red pepper flakes; stir until butter sizzles. Remove
from heat, season with salt.

Add vinegar to a large skillet of simmering water and reheat to
simmering. Crack eggs into the water and simmer until the eggs are
softly cooked, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove eggs from
water, drain briefly and place 2 eggs atop yogurt on each plate.
Rewarm butter mixture if necessary, spoon over the eggs and serve
immediately with warmed pita bread.
