Title: Delicate Whole-Wheat Pasta
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 8 servings
2 ea Eggs
2 ts Olive oil
2 tb Water -- (more as needed)
1 c  Flour -- whole-wheat pastry
1 ts Salt
1 c  Flour -- unbleached
Sift flours and salt together into a large mixing bowl or food
processor. Add the eggs and oil, and work together until you have a
moderately sticky lump (if working by hand) or a grainy mixture (if
working with a food processor).  Add 2 T. water, and work the dough
until you have a fairly firm lump.  Add a little more water or flour
as needed to get a good-feeling texture.

If working by hand, don't try to reincorporate the flakes that fall
off the main lump.  Knead the dough gently for 5 minutes, wrap in a
damp dish towel, and let it rest 30 minutes to an hour.

Divide the dough into 8 parts and roll out very thin with a rolling
pin or pasta roller.  It will thicken and shrink a bit after the
rolling, so roll a little thinner than you want it to end up.

Makes 24 lasagna noodles, or enough spaghetti/fettucine for 8.
