Cook split peas with 8 cups water plus the turmeric.  Bring to a

until the peas are quite tender.  Remove from heat & let sit for 5
minutes.

Using a ladle, remove the thin liquid on top of the peas.  Add enough
of the remaining thicker liquid to make up 5 1/4 cups.  Put in a
blender, in batches if necessary, along with cumin, lemon juice,
salt, pepper & chile. Blend & check for seasoning.

Chill for a few hours, but not long enough that it begins to jell.
Meanwhile, cut scallions into paper thin rounds, put in a bowl of
water & refrigerate them.  Drain well & pat dry.

Add cilantro to soup & pour into individual bowls.  Divide tomato,
cucumbers, scallions into the bowls & serve.
