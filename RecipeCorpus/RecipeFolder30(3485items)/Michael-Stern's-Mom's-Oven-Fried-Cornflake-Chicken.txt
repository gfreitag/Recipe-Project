Michael Stern and his wife, Jane, are the coauthors of the
best-selling American cookbook Square Meals.

Like many Americans - and for that matter like many of the worlds'
great chefs and food experts - Michael came by his love of good
simple food at his mother's table. Regarding his recipe he writes:

Cornflake chicken is the playful side of American home cooking. Of
course, it is no replacement for chicken pan-fried in lard; but it is
easy, it is delicious in its own right, and it is fun. Such culinary
fun, which involves making something new from unlikely off-the-shelf
supermarket products, is as

American as mock apple pie.

1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Mix together eggs and milk in a shallow
dish. Mix cornflake crumbs, salt, and pepper in a separate dish.

2. Dip chicken pieces first in the egg mixture, then dredge in crumbs
to coat evenly.

3. Arrange chicken pieces in a greased 13 X 9 X 2-inch  baking dish.
Drizzle with melted butter. Bake uncovered for 1 hour.
