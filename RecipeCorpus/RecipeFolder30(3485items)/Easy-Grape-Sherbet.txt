Title: Easy Grape Sherbet
Categories: Desserts, Homestyle
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Milk
1 c  Unsweetened Grape Juice
1/2 c  Sugar
Warm grape juice. Dissolve sugar into it. Add cold milk. (See note.)
Pour into 2 ice trays and freeze. When solid, remove from trays and
beat briskly with an egg beater. Return to trays, cover with foil or
wax paper, and refreeze. For some reason this sherbet tastes like
violets. Note: Mixture may curdle but will become smooth during the
freezing process.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
