Pass the hot potatoes through a food mill and cool. Lightly knead in
the flour. Add the egg yolk, ricotta and ricotta salads and knead
lightly. Add the chard, cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper, mix well and
knead until smooth. Do not over-knead.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into 1/2" ropes and
cut into 3/4" lengths. Chill for at least 45 minutes.

Bring 3 quarts of salted water to the boil and add the gnocchi in
three batches. Cook until they rise to the top and remove with a
slotted spoon.

Warm the chicken broth and whisk in the garlic puree, olive oil, salt
and pepper. Divide the gnocchi into 8 dishes, ladle with the broth
and garnish with prociutto and cheese.

Note: To roast garlic, remove the papery skin from the whole head and
slice off 1/4" across the top. Place garlic in a small baking dish
and drizzle with olive oil. Cover with foil and cook for 30 minutes
at 350'F. Remove foil and cook 20 minutes longer, or until soft.
