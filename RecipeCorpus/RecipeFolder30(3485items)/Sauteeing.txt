Title: Sauteeing
Categories: Meats, Information
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients
To saute, heat a film of oil or clarified butter in a saute pan until
it smokes. (Clarified butter is heated until it separates and the
solids skimmed off). Add a thin slice of boneless meat, dredged in
flour, and cook just long enough to brown well on both sides. The
meat must be thin enough and tender enough to cook to doneness in
that amount of time. If it is thicker, it should be grilled, broiled,
or pan-fried.
