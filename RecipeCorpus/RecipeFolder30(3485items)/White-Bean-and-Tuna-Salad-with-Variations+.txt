If you use the canned beans, after draining them, rinse them well
under cold running water in a colander to get rid of the thick gummy
liquid that clings to them. Shake well to free of excess water, then
put the canned or the freshly cooked beans into a serving bowl or
dish. Pour the vinaigrette sauce (made of olive oil, wine vinegar,
pepper and garlic) over the beans, letting it run through to coat
them, then toss very lightly to distribute the vinaigrette-don't toss
too much or the beans will break up. Put the onions and tuna on top
of the beans. Sprinkle with the basil and parsley. Just before
serving, add a little more oil and vinegar, if the salad seems to
need it, and toss lightly to combine ingredients.

VARIATIONS:

1. Add 1/2 cup small black olives and 6 chopped anchovy fillets with
the onions and tuna.

2. Use canned salmon, or boneless, skinless canned sardines instead of
tuna.

3. Omit the tuna. Serve bean salad in tomato shells, as a first
course. To prepare the shells, slice off about 1/2" of the top, scoop
out all the seeds and pulp, and turn the hollow shells upside down to
drain.
