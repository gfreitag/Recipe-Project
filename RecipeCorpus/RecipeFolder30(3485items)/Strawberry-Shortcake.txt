Title: Strawberry Shortcake
Categories: Fruit, Cake/cookie
Yield: 6 servings
(packed)
2 tb Butter -- melted
3/4 c  Low-fat Milk
1 pt Strawberries*
Heavy Cream  (optional)
3/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
3/4 c  Unbleached White Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Plus 3T Brown Sugar
* Sweet, ripe strawberries, hulled and crushed

Preheat oven to 400 deg F.

In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt.
In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter
until it dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the
dry ingredients and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the
dough out onto a well-floured board and knead for a minute or so.
Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll
out to to fit the bottom of a pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2
lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until dough is
golden brown.

In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining
3 T sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.

Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch.
Place 1 round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top
with the other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best
served fresh and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly
beaten heavy cream if you'd like.
