From Julia Burton, wife of British Consul General Graham Burton.

Wash the potato.  Prick with a fork and rub with salt.  Bake in a
350F oven until potato is tender, about 1 hour.  Cut in half and
scoop out the flesh without breaking the skin, leaving only a thin
layer of potato on the inside.

Chop the smoked salmon and divide between potato halves.  Spoon in 2
or 3 tablespoons of sour cream and top with red or black caviar, or
some of each.  Serve.

From the San Francisco Chronicle, 6/15/88.
