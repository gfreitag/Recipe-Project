Title: May Wine (Maibowle)

*****  NONE  *****
Any good light, white wine should go into the punch powl -- Sauterne,
Moselle, or Rhine wine -- about a quart of it, and be stirred with
1/2 cup brandy.  Add simple syrup to taste and toss in slices of
pineapple, orange, lemon and a good handful of wild strawberries, the
biggest you can find. Add a large chunk of ice and crown it all with
white stars and leaves of sweet woodruff. In fact, it is of better
flavor, if the latter soaks in the wine an hour or so before the
fruit and ice are added. You may add a pint of cold champagne at the
last minute to give sparkle. Not too sweet herb cookies or pound cake
flavored with caraway or anise seeds are more suitable with a
cheese and crackers.

This is the most elaborate recipe I have seen.  Enjoy!
