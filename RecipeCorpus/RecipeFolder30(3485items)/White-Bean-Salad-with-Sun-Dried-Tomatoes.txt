may be rinsed in cold water to speed cooling.)

Finely chop tomatoes and garlic, either by hand or in a food
processor. Mix together chopped tomatoes and garlic with remaining
ingredients. Pour tomato mixture over drained beans and toss gently
to combine. Serve at room temperature, or lightly chilled.

May be served as a main dish with a salad of mixed greens and crusty
bread, or as an accompaniment with other foods.  Makes a nice picnic
dish!
