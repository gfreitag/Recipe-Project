Fish curry is the literal translation of kare Ikan; but I should
explain that Indonesian 'curry' is rather different from Indian
curries. The recipe may be used for almost any fish.  In the former
version of this book I suggested salmon steaks, which it suits well;
but these are now rather expensive.  It is better to select a white
fish with firm flesh, such as haddock, angler-fish, swordfish or
dogfish. In Australia the various fish known as whiting would be a
good choice. Americans might like to use snappers. Whatever fish is
used, it can be cut into small cubes or slices before frying.  Heat a
little oil in a heavy frying-pan, and carefully brown the fish in it.
Meanwhile, in another frying-pan, fry the chopped shallots (or onion)
and garlic until tender. Stir in the chilli, ginger, turmeric,
coriander, lemon grass, salam, salt and tamarind water. Let this
mixture simmer for 10 minutes, then put in the fish. Cover, and
simmer for another 10 minutes.  Add the santen and cook for a further
5 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with very thin slices of cucumber and
chopped mint. (Alternatively, put the cucumber and mint into the kare
itself for the last 2 minutes of cooking.) Incidentally, the same
kare can be made with prawns. There is no need to fry the prawns
separately; but fry them in the mixture of onion, etcetera for a few
minutes before you put in the tamarind water. Makes 4 servings. From
