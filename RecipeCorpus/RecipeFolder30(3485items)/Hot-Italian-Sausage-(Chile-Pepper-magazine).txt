Title: Hot Italian Sausage (Chile Pepper magazine)
Categories: Homemade, Sausage
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Fennel seed
1 ts Italian seasoning
3 oz Dry red wine
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Crushed red chile
1/2 ts Cayenne powder
2 lb Pork, coarsely ground
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 ts Coarsely ground black pepper
Knead together all ingredients in a large bowl.  Stuff the mixture
firmly into hog casings, pricking any trapped air bubbles with a pin.
Tie off in 4 to 6-inch lengths.

Cook the sausages in your preferred manner and crumble them over
lasagna, or slice and serve them with a spicy marinara sauce over
spaghetti. I advise doubling the recipe and making sausage pizzas.
