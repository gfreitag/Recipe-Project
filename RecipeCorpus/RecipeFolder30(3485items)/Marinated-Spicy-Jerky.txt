Categories: Meats, Game
Yield: 2 pounds
4 ts Onion powder
2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Liquid smoke
1 c  Water
3/4 c  Soy sauce
1 c  Worcestershire sauce
8 lb Beef or venison round
-or flank steak
8 ts Salt
4 ts Pepper
4 ts Chili powder
4 ts Garlic powder
Trim all fat off the meat and cut into 1/8" thick strips. Mix other
ingredients together in a bowl. Add the meat and cover. Marinade
overnight. Remove from marinade and pat strips between towels. Line a
cookie sheet with foil and arrange meat on it in a single layer. Dry
for 8 or more hours at 175, turning after 6 hour. Cool and store in a
tightly covered jar or sealed in plastic bag. Or place in a
dehydrator until dried. Sun drying is the original method and takes
several days. Cover drying meat with cheesecloth to keep insects away
while drying. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   05-14-95
