This doesn't get any easier.

Take 1 chicken breast.  Place on a microwavable plate.  Sprinkle the
back with lemon juice, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and
crushed basil or tarragon.  Turn over and repeat on front.  Cover
with Saran Wrap with a little opening left for excess steam to
escape. Microwave on HIGH for about 5 minutes (depending on the size
of the breast -- if they're small, you may want to check after 4
minutes).  Very tasty and juicy.

Of course, you can cook more pieces (or different pieces) at the same
time. If you increase the number of pieces, arrange them on the plate
so the fleshy parts are toward the outside of the plate, since that
part cooks faster than the middle of the plate area, and adjust the
cooking time.

I test for doneness by cutting in to the bone.  If I see no red and
the juices run clear, the chicken is done.
