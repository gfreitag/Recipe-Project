This is a toned-down version of the soup that Rasputin always said
gave him his health, vigor ... and virility. It was, according to his
daughter, his favorite dish. "Restaurants in Petrograd and Moscow
would prepare the concoction whenever they expected Rasputin to
dine." Paprika and minced ginger usually went into his recipe.

Clean codfish. Remove head and cut fish into fillets. Remove fish
bones. Cut fillets into 2" pieces and place in saucepan. Add milk and
whipping cream. Place over medium heat and bring to scalding
temperature. Do not boil.

Reduce heat and continue simmering until fish is done. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup bowls and serve hot.

Makes about 1 quart, or 4 servings.
