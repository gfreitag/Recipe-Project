This simple Indian curry is a good example of green mango use. To 50 g
desiccated coconut add just enough boiling water to moisten, stir and
set aside (or use 70 g fresh coconut).  Peel 800 g green prawns and
devein them.  Peel two green mangoes and cut the flesh into 2 cm
cubes.

Into the bowl of a food processor put 3 birdseye chillies (or less to
taste), a tablespoon of ground coriander and the coconut.  Process to
a paste.

Peel and slice 2 onions.  Chop half a bunch of fresh coriander. In a
saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and fry the onions gently until
they are transparent.  Add 2 or 3 fresh or dried curry leaves and the
coconut paste and continue frying over a low heat, stirring
occasionally, for about 10 minutes.  Add 500 mL water. salt to taste,
half a tablespoon of turmeric, the mango and simmer for 10 minutes.
Add half a cup of thick coconut milk and the prawns and cook for a
further few minutes, just until the prawns turn pink.

Remove to a serving dish, scatter the chopped coriander leaves over
the top an serve with rice.

Makes 4 to 5 servings.
