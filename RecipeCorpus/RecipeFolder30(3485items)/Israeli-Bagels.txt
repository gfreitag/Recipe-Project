ISRAELI BAGELS

These chewy bagels can be seen strung around poles at just about every
kiosk in Israel. They are thinner, but larger in circumference, than
American bagels -- crispier, with more salt on the outside and less
on the inside. Chewing these pretzel-like bagels is a good outlet for
excess energy.

Dissolve yeast and sugar in water. Combine with remaining
ingredients. Beat well. Knead until soft and smooth. Let rest for 10
minutes but do not let rise. Shape into bagels by pinching off pieces
of dough. Roll each piece into a rope 1/2-inch thick and 6 inches
long. Attach ends. Place on a greased cookie sheet, brush with
yolk-water mixture, and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake in a
preheated 425 F oven for about 20 minutes until golden brown.

VARIATION:

Dough can be rolled into pencil-thin strips, shaped into pretzels or
different letters of the alphabet, and baked at 425 F for 15 minutes.
