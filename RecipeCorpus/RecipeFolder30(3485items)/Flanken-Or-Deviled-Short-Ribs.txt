FLANKEN OR DEVILED SHORT RIBS

Have the butcher cut the meat into serving portions. Cut off excess
fat, and melt it in a heavy saucepan. Mix flour, mustard, salt and
pepper. Roll the pieces of meat in this. Brown the meat well in the
fat over medium-high heat. Add onion and brown slightly. Add vinegar,
cover the pan, and cook over very low heat about 2 hours, until the
meat is tender. Skim off any excess fat. A 2 or 3 quart saucepan may
be used for this. From: The Original Jewish Cookbook by Mildred G.
