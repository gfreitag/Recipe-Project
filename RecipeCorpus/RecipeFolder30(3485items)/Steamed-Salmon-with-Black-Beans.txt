Title: Steamed Salmon with Black Beans
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 3 servings
1 tb Fermented black beans,
-coarsely chopped
1 ts Sesame seed oil
Cilantro or parsley sprigs,
-for garnish
1 lb Salmon fillets or steaks
3 ts Dry Sherry
1 ts Grated, peeled fresh ginger
1/4 ts Salt
1    Garlic clove, pureed
2 tb Thinly sliced scallions
Place the fish in a heat-proof dish at least 1" deep. (If you are
using a fillet, place it skin side down.) Stir together the Sherry,
ginger, salt and garlic in a small bowl. Pour this mixture onto the
fish and rub generously on both sides. Let stand at least 15 minutes.

Spread the scallions and beans evenly on top of the dish. Drizzle with
sesame seed oil.

Bring the water in the steamer to a vigorous boil. Place the dish on
the steamer tray and cover. Steam about 10 minutes, checking for
doneness after about 8 minutes. The fish will look opaque and feel
springy to the touch. It is better to undercook slightly than to
overcook; the heat in the fish will finish the cooking. Serve
immediately
