Title: Kentucky Moutain Pancakes
Categories: Breakfast, Pcake/waffl
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Milk
7 tb Unsalted Butter -- melted
And cooled
4 tb Butter
2 tb Vegetable Oil
2 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Baking Powder
3 lg Eggs -- separated
1. Sift the flour into a bowl. Add the sugar, salt, and baking
powder, and sift again. Set aside.

2. Put the egg yolks in a large bowl. Beat well by hand or with an
electric mixer. Add the milk, and beat again.

3. Add the flour mixture and mix gently but thoroughly, Blend in the
melted butter.

4. Beat the egg whites until they are stiff but not dry and grainy.
Gently fold them into the egg mixture. Allow the batter to rest 20 to
30 mins, if you can.

5. Heat the solid butter and the oil in a small saucepan, and keep
warm. Heat a black iron or electric griddle over high heat and brush
it with the oil and butter before you cook each batch of pancakes.
Use 2 to 4 Tbs batter for each pancake.

6. When pancakes are golden brown on one side, turn them with a
spatula to brown the other. DO NOT TURN THEM BUT ONCE. However, shake
the griddle often as the pancakes cook so they will brown more
evenly. Serve at once with butter and your favorite syrup. Never keep
a pancake waiting!

Serves 6.

Note: This batter can be made with an electric mixer, but it is best
made by hand with a whisk. Because of the large amount of baking
powder, this batter is stiffer than you might expect, but the
pancakes will be very porous and tender.
