Title: Abgeruerter Gugelhopf
Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie, Jewish
Yield: 8 servings
1/16 ts Salt
x  Lemon Rind; grated
3 c  All-Purpose Flour; sifted
1/3 c  Seedless Raisins
1/4 c  Citron; chopped
1 ea Compressed Yeast Cake
1 c  Lukewarm Milk
1/2 c  Soft Butter
1/3 c  Sugar
3 ea Eggs; well beaten
Dissolve the yeast in the milk. Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar and 1
cup of the flour. Beat until smooth and let rise for 30 minutes at
85F. In a separate bowl cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs,
salt, lemon rind, and yeast sponge, and beat thoroughly. Blend the
remaining flour with raisins and citron and add. Pour into a
well-greased 10 inch tube pan and let rise at 85F until the pan is
7/8 full. Bake at 350F for 20 minutes, then cover the pan with a
piece of brown paper to prevent too rapid browning. Continue baking
about 15 minutes longer, until a cake tester inserted in the center
comes out dry, the cake has shrunk away from the sides of the pan
slightly, and the top is a rich brown. Invert on a rack and remove
from the pan. Serve inverted. This makes 8-10 portions.

BUNT KUCHEN:

Omit raisins and citron from Gugelhopf batter. Decorate a well greased
bunt form (this is a fluted tube pan) with blanched almonds, pour in
batter, and let rise and bake as Gugelhopf.

SAVARIN:

Prepare and bake Gugekhopf. While it is still hot, pour about 1/4 of
the following Rum Syrup over it. Cool completely and serve with the
remaining warm syrup and Whipped Cream.

RUM SYRUP FOR SAVARIN
=====================

Cook 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, and 1 1/2 grated lemon rind for 5
minutes after it comes to a boil. Strain and add 1/4 cup rum. Pour
over the cake while the syrup is still warm, and serve warm.

WHIPPED CREAM
=============

Chill the required amount of whipping cream thoroughly. Place in a
bowl with steep sides and whip with a rotary or electric beater until
the cream thickens. For ice creams and frozen pudings, whip until the
cream barely holds its shape. For Whipped Cream beaten stiff, whip
until it stands in peaks. Serve plain, or sweeten to taste with
confectioners' sugar , and flavor with a few drops of extract. As a
topping for cake, 1/2 cup of well drained chopped fruit may be added
to each 1 1/2 cups of Whipped Cream after it is beaten; whipping
cream before it is beaten.
