Title: Korean Skewered Beef
Categories: Korean, Meats
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  Sesame or other oil
1/4 c  Minced green onions
Toasted sesame seeds
1 lb Sirloin steak
1    Clove garlic, crushed
1/2 c  Soy sauce
Thinly slice steak into 1-inch wide strips.  Dip strips into a
marinade made by combining garlic with rest of ingredients.  Now dip
in crushed toasted sesame seeds to cover the meat completely, and
return to the marinade for an hour.  Weave on bamboo sticks and broil
quickly, or, if you prefer, fry quickly in a little oil.  (The sesame
seeds are toasted by cooking slowly in a heavy skillet, until brown.
They are then crushed in a mortar or heavy bowl, with salt.  The
mixture should not be smooth.)
