Title: Roast 'possum
Categories: Meats, Game
Yield: 1 servings
1    Hard boiled egg
1 ts Salt
Water for stuffing
1 qt Water for roasting pan
4 sl Bacon
1    Opossum
1    Onion chopped
1 tb Fat
1/4 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 c  Bread crumbs
Opossum: Possum should be cleaned as soon as possible after shooting.
(Or however Jeff gets his dinner) It should be hung for 48 hours
(that is more than enough time for you to come from Bama to Md) and
is then ready to be skinned and cooked.  The meat is light colored
and tender. Excess fat may be removed, but there is no strong flavor
or odor contained in the fat.

Rub possum with salt and pepper.  Brown onion in fat.  Add liver and
cook until tender.  Add bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, egg, salt
and water. Mix thoroughly and stuff possum.  Truss like a fowl.

Put in roasting pan with bacon across back and pour one quart of
water into the pan.  Roast uncovered in 350 oven until tender - about
2 1/2 hours. Serve with sweet potatoes.
