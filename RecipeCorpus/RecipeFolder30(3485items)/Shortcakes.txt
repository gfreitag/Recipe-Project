Title: Shortcakes
Categories: Breakfast, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Butter -- melted
1 1/2 qt Combined Fruit*
Granulated Sugar -- to
Taste
Whipped Cream -- for
Topping
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
4 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 tb Brown Sugar, Soft
1/3 c  Vegetable Shortening Or
Butter
2/3 c  Light Cream
* Combine strawberries or raspberries mixed with blueberries and
sliced peaches. Preheat oven to 425 F. Mix and sift flour, baking
powder, salt, and brown sugar. Cut in shortening with a knife or rub
into batter with fingertips. Add light cream gradually, mixing to a
soft dough. Roll out on a lightly floured board to slightly over
1/2-inch thickness. Cut 12 circles with large biscuit cutter. Place 6
circles in a lightly buttered pan or on a cookie sheet. Brush with
melted butter and top with the remaining 6 circles. Bake for 15 mins.
Then let the shortcakes cool slightly, remove the top half, and put
the fruit, sweetened with sugar to taste, in any combination of your
choice between the halves and on top of the cakes. Make sure the
fruit has lots of juice. (add a little orange juice if it doesn't.)
Top with a dot of whipped cream. NOTE: The same shortcakes can be
used with creamed meat or fish filling, by omitting the brown sugar.
Yield: 6 shortcakes.
