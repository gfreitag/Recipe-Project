-
For frying
1 c  (Heaping) Sugar
4 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Salt
pn Nutmeg
3 1/2 c  Flour
1    Egg
Mix dry ingredients and add t the egg, milk, and cream or lard, using
enough flour so the mixture will not soak. Knead well. The consistency
should be like bread dough.

Roll out about 1/3" thick, cut with a doughnut cutter, and let sit
for 5 mins.

Heat the frying lard of shortening to near smoking. The doughnuts
should be fried quickly on each side so they will not soak up the
fat. Drain on brown paper.

Note: If you like, roll the doughnuts in confectioners' sugar. You can
freeze the doughnuts and then heat them at 400 F for a few mins until
thawed -- almost as good as newly cooked.

Makes 25 doughnuts and holes.
