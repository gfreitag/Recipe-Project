Title: Proper Scottish Oat Scones
Categories: Breads, Low cal/fat
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Raisins
1 lg Egg; lightly beaten
1/2 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
2 tb Canola oil
2 tb Butter
1 1/4 c  Rolled oats
3/4 c  All-purpose white flour
3/4 c  Whole-wheat pastry flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
The yogurt reduces the grams of fat to 1/2 the regular recipe.
Browning the butter intensifies its flavor, so less is needed. Soft
pastry flour requires less shortening than harder, higher gluten
all-purpose or bread flour. [You could probably replace the 1/4 cup
sugar with 1/8 cup Fructose, but I have not tried this.]

Preheat oven to 425. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking
spray. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat and cook until
it begins to turn light brown., about 2 min. Skim foam and pour into
a small bowl. In a large bowl, stir together oats, flour, sugar,
baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir in the raisins and make a
well in the center. In a small bowl, combine the browned butter, egg,
yogurt and oil; add to the dry ingredients, stirring until just
moistened. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead
several times to form a ball. Pat into an 8" circle and cut into 8
wedges. Place the wedges on the baking sheet and bake about 12 min.,
or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Transfer to a rack
and let cool slightly. Serve warm.
