Title: Kerry Casserole (Irish)
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Irish
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Onions
3/4 c  Stock
1 x  Salt and pepper
2 oz Butter
3/4 lb Belly of pork
3/4 lb Smoked bacon
2 lb Potatoes
1/4 lb Mushrooms
1 ts Rosemary
(Irish pork belly has a fatty layer, vital for the flavor, and a meaty
layer.  See if you can get your butcher to give you pork that has
about equal amounts of pork and fat.  Plain lean pork will not taste
as good.) Cut meat into one-inch cubes. Peel and thinly slice
potatoes. Peel or wipe mushrooms, and slice if large.  Grease a large
ovenproof dish with some of the butter, and place a layer of sliced
potatoes in the bottom.  Add half the meat pieces, seasoned and
sprinkled with rosemary.  Layer with half the vegetables, plus
another layer of potatoes.  Repeat, using all meat, veg and potatoes.
Pour stock over and dot potatoes with remaining butter.
Cover and cook in a moderate oven, 325F, for 2 1/4 hours.  Uncover
for the last half hour of cooking to brown the potatoes.
