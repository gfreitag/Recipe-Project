This is a light dish from "What's for Dinner" by Michael Roberts
(Morrow) that is worthy of main-course status. Top them with
ratatouille or grilled vegetables.

Combine the couscous, flour, coriander, baking powder and 1/4
teaspoon each of the salt and pepper in a bowl. Add the eggs and
milk, mixing well. Stir in the butter, cover and set aside to rest
for 20 minutes.

To cook the pancakes: Place an 8" skillet over medium heat and brush
with a little melted butter. Stir the batter to recombine. Then spoon
2-3 tablespoons of batter per pancake into the skillet, making 3
pancakes at a time. Cook until bubbles rise to the surface of the
pancakes and break, about 1-2 minutes. Using a spatula, flip the
pancakes and cook for 2 minutes. Remove pancakes from the skillet,
cover and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, using as
little butter as possible without allowing the pancakes to stick to
the bottom of the pan.

To serve, warm the pancakes in a hot oven, if necessary. Arrange the
pancakes on individual plates, and mound the ratatouille or grilled
vegetables next to them. Spoon any vegetable juices around, and serve
