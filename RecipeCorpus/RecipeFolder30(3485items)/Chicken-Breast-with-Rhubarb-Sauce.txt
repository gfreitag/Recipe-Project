Title: Chicken Breast with Rhubarb Sauce
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Flour
1/4 ts White pepper
5 c  Rhubarb cut into 1/2 inch
2 tb Honey
Bunch watercress, washed
4 x  Whole chicken breasts
1 ts Thyme
4 tb Oil
2 ts Freshly grated orange zest
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
Cut each breast into two and gently cut and pull the skin and fat
away from the meat.  Mix the flour with the thyme and pepper then
lightly dust the breast halves with the mixture and set aside. Heat a
tablespoon of oil in a saucepan and toss in the rhubarb.  Cover and
cook gently over medium- low heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until the
rhubarb is tender. Stir in the orange zest, a tablespoon of honey and
the worcestershire sauce.

Cover again and cook for another minute or two. Taste and add the
extra honey if you want a sweeter sauce. Stir to form a puree and set
it aside in a warm spot.  Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and
add the halved breasts to the pan. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes or longer
if they are especially large. To serve, place each breast on a warmed
plate and slice on the on the diagonal into 6 or 7 thin slices. Add
some rhubarb puree and watercress. Serves 8. Potatoes, carrots, and
fresh peas are all good accompaniments.
