Food writer Norene Gilletz has adapted her grandmother's chicken soup
recipe for cooking by microwave.
In a soup kettle, combine chicken and salted water. Bring to a boil. Skim
surface. Add carrots, celery, onion, dill and pepper to the hot broth.
Cover and simmer until meat is tender and vegetables are cooked -- about
two hours. Strain and refrigerate. Remove the fat that congeals on top and
discard. Serve soup with noodles or rice, cooked separately or in the
strained broth.
Microwave method: Gilletz prefers this method, because all the ingredients
and can be added at once and there is no need to skim the broth.
In a bowl, pour boiling water over chicken. Trim off excess fat. Place
chicken in a five-quart microwave-safe casserole. Cut carrots and celery
into chunks. Add to chicken along with onion, dill and seasonings. cover
with water. To prevent boiling over, take care water remains 1 1/2 inches
below top of the casserole. Cover casserole and microwave at high (100 %)
power for 30 - 35 minutes or until soup is boiling. Stir. Simmer at medium
power for 25 - 30 minutes. Let stand covered for 15 - 20 minutes. Strain
soup. Serve as above.
