Categories: Beef, Lamb, India
Yield: 6 servings
3 lb cubed lamb
4 ts paprika
1/2 ts cayenne pepper
1 1/2 ts dried ginger
3 2/3 c  water or beef broth
1/4 ts garam masala
1 tb whole fennel seeds
3 1/4 c  plain yoghurt
6 tb vegetable oil
1 ea 3/4" stick of cinnamon
1/2 ts whole cloves
2 1/2 ts salt
1 pn asafetida
Grind  the fennel seeds until find.   Put the yoghurt in a bowl and beat
it with a fork until smooth and creamy.
Heat  the oil in a large pot over a high flame.   When hot,  put in  the
cinnamon and cloves.   A second later,  put in the ground asafetida.   A
second after that,  put in all the meat and the salt.   Stir the meat an
cook, still on a high flame for about 5 minutes.  Now put in the paprika
and  cayenne and give the meat a good stir.   Slowly add the yoghurt,  a
small amount at a time,  stirring the meat vigorously as you do so.  Add
all  the yoghurt this way.   Keep cooking on high heat until all  liquid
has  boiled  away and the meat pieces have browned  slightly.   Add  the
fennel and ginger.   Give the meat some more good stirs.  Now put in the
water  or broth,  cover so as to leave the lid very slightly  ajar,  and
cook  on medium heat for 30 minutes.   Cover completely and cook on  low
heat for another 45 minutes or until meat is tinder.   Stir a few  times
as  the meat cooks,  making sure that there is always some liquid in the
pot.
Remove  the  lid and add the garam masala.   You should  have  a  thick,
reddish brown sauce.  If it is too thin, boil away some of the liquid.
