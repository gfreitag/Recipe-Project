Title: Apple Butter
Categories: Fruits
Yield: 12 servings
1 lb Brown Sugar
3/4 c  Apple Cider
3 qt Unsweetened Applesauce
2 lb Granulated Sugar
-----------------------------------SPICES-----------------------------------
3/4 ts Cloves
3 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg

The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier
texture that's best for applesauce.
Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider together and cook in a slow oven (325
deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more.
Apple butter requires long, slow cooking.
(Can also be made in a crockpot.)
