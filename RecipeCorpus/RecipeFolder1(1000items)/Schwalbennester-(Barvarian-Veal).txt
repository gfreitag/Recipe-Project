unsliced egg on top of the bacon.  Rollup each slice of veal (jelly-roll
fashion) and tie together with string.  Heat oil in frypan and brown veal
rolls well on all sides.  Add onion; saute for 3 minutes.  Add the hot
bouillon; cover and simmer gently 25 minutes.  Remove the veal from the
pan.  Remove the strings from the veal and keep veal warm on a serving
platter.  Add tomato paste to the pan drippings; stir.  Thoroughly mix
flour and red wine to remove all lumps.  Add to sauce and cook until
mixture thickens.  Add warm veal rolls and heat through.  Before serving,
place veal rolls on a platter, pour sauce over the rolls and serve with
pureed potatoes.
