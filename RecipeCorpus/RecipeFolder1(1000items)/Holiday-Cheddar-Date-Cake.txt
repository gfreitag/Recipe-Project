Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. and grease and flour a 10-inch tube
pan; set aside.  In a large bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar with an
electric mixer on medium, until well blended.  Add the eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in the cheddar cheese.  Sift
the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves into a medium bowl.  In
another medium bowl, combine the dates, pecans, cherries and raisins.  Add
2 Tbls of the flour mixture, tossing lightly to coat the fruit and nuts.
Alternately beat the remaining flour mixture and milk into the butter
mixture until well blended.  Stir in the floured fruit mixture by hand
until distributed throughout the batter.  Turn into the prepared pan.
Bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours in the preheated oven until the cakes shrinks
from the side of the pan and the top springs back when lightly pressed.
Cool for 15 minutes in the pan on a wire rack then remove from the pan.
Cool completely on the wire rack.  When cool, store in a container with a
tight lid for up to 6 weeks.  To serve, cut into thin slices.
