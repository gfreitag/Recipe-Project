Title: Tzatziki Sauce
Categories: Garlic, Appetizers, Sauces
Yield: 2 servings
1 x  Same As In 6
Prepare the Sauce as in Tzatziki but only drain the yougurt for 6 to 7
hours.  The mixture can be used in several ways.  It is zesty on hamburger
sandwiches.  Top each burger with a slice of ripe tomato, a small heap of
grated cabbage, and a dollop of Tzatziki sauce.  It can also be served
with grilled meats.  The meat juices mingling with the tzatziki are
utterly delicious.
As a sauce for tomatoes, it is something special.  Cut several ripe
tomatoes into sections, cutting from stem to stern, but do not cut all the
way through.  Open the tomato like a flower.  Salt lightly and invert on
paper towles to drain for a few minutes.  Fill each tomato with some
tzatziki and garnish with fresh mint.
