Title: Creamed Onions
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
4 tb Butter
1/2 ts Salt
8 ea White onions
1/2 pt Whipping cream
4 tb Flour
Peel the onions.  Parboil in about 3/4 cup water.  (I do this part
in a covered casserole in the microwave).  Make white sauce with
rest of ingredients.  If you like a stronger onion flavor, thin the
white sauce with part or all of the onion water.  Otherwise, thin it
with your choice of cream, milk, water, chicken broth or whatever
flavor you like.  Add onions and bake at 325 to 350 until bubbly. If
you're a real creamed onion pig like we are, this will not serve
four.
