Title: Snails, Sicilian Style
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 x  Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c  Lemon juice
2 lb Land snails
1 x  Water
1 x  Salt
2 ea Cloves garlic finely chopped
Serves 6 to 8.
1.  There is a small membrane, known as an operculum, at the opening
of each snail.  Use a toothpick to remove this membrane and it will
come off easily.
2.  Place the snails in a basin and rinse thoroughly with cold
water.  Drain and rinse once more in cold water that contains a
generous amount of salt.  Rinse once more in cold water before
cooking.
3.  Add four quarts of cold water to a kettle and add the snails and
about three tablespoons salt.  Bring slowly to a boil and simmer six
minutes, stirring occasionally.
4.  Meanwhile, place the garlic and one teaspoon of salt in a small,
heavy bowl.  Crush the garlic with a pestle or the back of a heavy
spoon to make a paste.  Add the oil, pepper (to taste), lemon juice,
and six tablespoons cold water.  Stir with a whisk to blend.
5.  Drain the snails and serve hot with the sauce cold.
Note:  To eat the snails, pull out the meat with a pick and dip them
one at a time in the sauce.  The whole snail may be eaten, although
the most fastidious prefer to skip the soft after end of the meat,
which is the digestive tract.
