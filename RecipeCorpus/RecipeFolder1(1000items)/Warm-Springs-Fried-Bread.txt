Title: Warm Springs Fried Bread
Categories: Breads, Londontowne
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
2 tb Melted butter
1 ts Sugar
1 x  Fat for deep frying
3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 tb Butter
2 ts Baking powder
3/4 c  (to 1c) Warm milk
Combine dry ingredients; cut in butter. Add enough warm milk to make a
soft dough, easy to handle. Knead on floured board until dough is very
smooth and soft but elastic. Do not use a lot of extra flour.
Divide dough into 6-8 balls and brush the tops with melted butter. Cover
and let stand 30-45 minutes. Pat out each ball into a round, 5 or 6 inches
in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Fry in deep fat (preheated to 365
degrees). Dough should rise immediately to surface. Cook until brown on
one side, turn, and brown on other side being careful to not pierce crust.
Drain on absorbent paper and serve hot.
