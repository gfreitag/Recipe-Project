Scrub baking potatoes with a brush.  Prick with a fork in several places.
Place potatoes in a shallow baking dish.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100%
power for 6 to 8 minutes or till potatoes are tender.  Cut a lengthwise
slice from the top of each potato.  Discard the skin from the lengthwise
slices, place the potato portions from the lengthwise slices in a mixing
bowl.  Scoop out the insides of the potatoes leaving two 1/4-inch thick
shells; reserve the shells.  Add the insides of the potatoes to the mixing
bowl containing the potato portions from the top slices; mash.  Stir in
shredded cheddar cheese, butter or margarine and sliced green onion.  Beat
in enough milk to give the mixture a stiff consistency.  Season to taste
with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Pile the mashed potato mixture into
the reserved potato shells.  Return to the shallow baking dish.
Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power for 2 to 3 minutes or till potato
mixture is heated through.  Sprinkle with paprika, if desired.
