1/2 c  Grated parmesan
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley

If using fresh spinach, wash the spinch and remove the rough stems.  Place
in large bowl and sprinkle heavily with salt.  Rub the salt into the
leaves by thakin them up, a bunch at a time, and rubbing them between your
hands;  the volume of spinach will decrease drastically as you do. Tear
the sponach up as you do this. Rinse the salt off thoroughly and dry the
spinach, squeezing it in bunches in a towel.  (If using frozen spinach,
just let it thaw and squeeze out the excess moisture.)
Saute the onion and mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter with the
garlic and salt and pepper to taste. When both onions and mushrooms are
tender remove from heat.
Beat the eggs in a large bowl and crumble in the feta, add the parmesan,
then the spinach, onions, mushrooms, stir in the parsley, organo,
rosemary, some freshly ground pepper, and a little salt (remembering the
feta is very salty
