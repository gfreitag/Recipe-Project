Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never counted, so I
don't know for sure.  But it sure does make a bunch.  The main
reason why I said 48 is because the program, MenuMaster, won't
let you past that field unless you tell it something.
Justin Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that
originated after the Civil War.  People didn't have enough for
themselves to eat let alone feed their dogs, so when the old
hounds started barking from hunger, they would throw pieces of
fried corn bread to them, yelling, 'Shut up, dog!  Hush puppy!"
