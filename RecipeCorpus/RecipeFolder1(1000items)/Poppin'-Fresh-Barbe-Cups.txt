the bbq sauce, onion and brown sugar and set aside.  Separate the biscuit
dough into 12 pieces and place one in each of 12 ungreased muffin cups,
pressing the dough up the sides to the edge of the cup.  Spoon the mixture
into the cups and sprinkle with the shredded Cheddar Cheese.  Bake in a
preheated 400 degrees F. oven for 12 minutes.  Serve hot.

pieces) in place of the meat mixture.  You can also add green bell pepper
or a hot pepper to the above recipe with good results.
