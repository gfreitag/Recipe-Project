Title: Pan Fried Trout
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Butter
1 x  Salt & Pepper; To Taste
2 lb Trout; Whole Or Fillets
1/2 c  Cornmeal
Rinse the trout under cold running water.  Pat dry.  Sprinkle with salt
and pepper.  Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet on medium-high heat.
Coat the trout in corn meal and shake off the excess.  When the butter is
melted, place the coated trout, flesh side down, in the skillet.  Fry 4-5

frying, if desired.)
