Title: Rice, Apple and Raisin Dressing
Categories: Cajun, Beef, Pork/ham, Dressings
Yield: 8 servings
-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
1 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Black pepper
2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts White pepper
1 ts Garlic powder
------------------------------RICE INGREDIENTS------------------------------
4 tb Unsalted butter
1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted
1/2 c  Raisins
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot,
about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans,
so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for
about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the raisins and butter
(these are added together so the raisins will absorb as much butter
as possible).  Stir until butter is melted, then cook until raisins
are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and
seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like
ce Krispies)  Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted rice.  Lucy
used brown, long grain rice - super!.  This will require about 2 to
3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice looks "frizzly".
Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in the apples.
Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5
minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is
tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.  (We cook the rice
this slow way to let the flavors build to their maximum.)
Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person.
