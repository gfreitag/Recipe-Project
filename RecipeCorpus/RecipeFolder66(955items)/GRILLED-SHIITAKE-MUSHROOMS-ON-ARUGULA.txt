Categories: Appetizers, Side dish, Vegetables

12 ea Shiitake mushrooms
4 ts Roasted sesame seeds
MMMMM----------------------SEASONING SAUCE---------------------------
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Oriental sesame oil
2 tb Olive oil

1. Prepare the seasoning sauce by combining the soy sauce, sesame oil,
olive oil, and sugar. Can be prepared up to a week ahead.

2. Preheat the broiler.

3. Wash the arugula and spin dry.

4. Clean the mushrooms and remove the stems. Place them cup side up
on a broiling rack.

5. Brush the seasoning sauce on the mushroom caps. Position the rack
4-6 inches from the heat and broil until the mushrooms look brown and
crusty, 2-3 minutes. They cook very quickly, so keep an eye on them.

small amount of seasoning sauce that's left in the pan over the
arugula. Sprinkle with the roasted sesame seeds and serve.
