In 7th century England, herbs were one of the few flavourings
available to cooks and were used heavily... Melt the butter in a
heavy pan and fry the meat with the leeks and garlic till the
vegetables are slightly softened and the meat lightly browned. Add
the barley, water, vinegar, bay leaves and seasoning. bring the pot
to the boil, cover it and simmer gently for 1 - 1 1/2 hours or till
the meat is really tender and ready to fall from the bone. Add the
sage and continue to cook for several minutes. Adjust the seasoning
to taste and serve in bowls-- the barley will serve as a vegetable.
