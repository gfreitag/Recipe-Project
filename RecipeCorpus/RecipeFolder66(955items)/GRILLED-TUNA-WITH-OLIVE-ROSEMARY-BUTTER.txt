ahead. Wrap tightly and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 45
minutes before continuing.)

Whisk olive oil with remaining 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice,
remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary and pepper in shallow dish. Arrange
tuna steaks in dish, turning to caot both sides. Let stand 15 minutes.

Prepare barbecue (high heat).  Grill tuna until just cooked through,
about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to platter. Place 1 tablespoon
rosemary butter on each steak. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.

Note from author:  A simple, sunny dish with the flavors of the south
of France.  The seasoned butter is our bonus, since the fish is
already delicious after its quick marinating in a rosemary
vinaigrette. Add a sliced tomato salad and buttered orzo (rice-shaped
pasta) for a satisfying meal.  Finish with freshing lemon sorbet.
