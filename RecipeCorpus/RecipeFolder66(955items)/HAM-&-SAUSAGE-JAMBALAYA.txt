Title: HAM & SAUSAGE JAMBALAYA
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 lb Hot sausage
4    Bay leaves
3 tb Oil
1/4 ts Powdered cloves
1 lb Ham, diced
1/4 ts Allspice
4    Onions, chopped
1/2 ts Powdered thyme
2    Bell peppers, chopped
1 ts Chili powder
5    Ribs celery, chopped
Salt
Black and cayenne pepper
1 lg Can tomatoes
4 c  Raw rice
6 c  Beef or chicken stock
1 bn Green onions, chopped
4    Cloves garlic, chopped
Slice the sausage and fry it up in the oil (preferably in a big cast
iron pot) until it is brown.  Then add the ham. Stir the ham and
sausage mixture while chopping the onions, peppers and celery. Then
add these vegetables to the pot and cook until they are tender. Nest,
add the tomatoes and cook a few minutes more. Add the stock, bring to
a boil and let simmer for 30 minutes.

While the food is simmering, chop and add the garlic, the bay leaves,
thyme, chili powder, allspice, cloves, salt, black pepper and cayenne
pepper. [Unless you have a healthy tolerance for hot food, start off
with 1 t of cayenne pepper and taste  before adding the rice.]

Now add the rice, bring to a boil and kepp it there for about 3
minutes. Then cover the pot and set stove to very low heat. After 15
minutes, stir the jambalaya. If it seems dry, add some more water.
Put the lid back on and cook for 15-20 more minutes. Add the chopped
green onions a few minutes before serving.

This makes 8-10 servings.  Also, it freezes very well, so don't be
afraid to make a lot.
