Brown meat and drain. cover meat with water. Add onion and garlic.
Boil slowly for 30 minutes. Add remaining ingredients. Simmer until
meat is tender (about 1 1/2 hours.)

The recipe above is a fairly old (circa 1983) but reliable one,
somewhere in between "competition" and "eating " chili. It would be a
good starter for any novice cook.
