Title: HAGGIS #2
Categories: Scottish
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Sheep's stomach bag plus the
-pluck (lights, liver and
-heart)
1 lb Lean mutton
6 oz Fine oatmeal
8 oz Shredded suet
2 lg Onions, chopped
salt and pepper about 1/4 pint beef stock Soak the stomach bag in
salted water overnight. Place the pluck (lights, liver and heart) in
a saucepan with the windpipe hanging over the edge. Cover with water
and boil for 1 1/2 hours. Impurities will pass out through the
windpipe and it is advisable to place a basin under it to catch any
drips. Drain well and cool. Remove the windpipe and any gristle or
skin. Mince the liver and heart with the mutton. (Add some of the
lights before mincing if you wish.) Toast the oatmeal gently until
pale golden brown and crisp. Combine with minced mixture, suet and
onion. Season well and add sufficient stock to moisten well. Pack
into the stomach bag, filling it just over half-full as the stuffing
will swell during cooking. Sew up the bag tightly or secure each end
with string. Put an upturned plate in the base of a saucepan of
boiling water, stand the haggis on this and bring back to the boil.
Prick the haggis all over with a large needle to avoid bursting and
boil steadily for 3 to 4 hours. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
