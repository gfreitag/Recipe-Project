Shepherd writes:  "BBQing vegetables brings out their sweetness and
imparts a smoky, nutty quality that is extraordinarily delicious.
Make them whenever you light up the coals all harvest season."

"Choose colorful ripe garden-fresh vegetables, such as summer squash,
eggplants, onions and different colored bell peppers. Cut eggplant,
onions and squash on the bias into about 1/2" thick slices. Cut
peppers into 2 to 3" strips or big scallops.  About an hour or so
before cooking, combine vegetables with any good olive oil-based
vinaigrette or use balsamic vinegar and olive oil with added minced
garlic, basil, pepper and salt.

"Prepare a BBQ fire, preferably using some fruit wood or mesquite
chips. When coals are evenly at the white ash stage, drain vegetables
well and grill on fine mesh BBQ grid about 4 to 6" from the coals.
Grill as slowly as possible until tender when pierced, turning
several times and moving vegetables around with a fork so that they
cook evenly. A little charring on the edges doesn't hurt them. Enjoy
warm with or without a meat course, and have crusty French bread to
sop up the tasty juices."
