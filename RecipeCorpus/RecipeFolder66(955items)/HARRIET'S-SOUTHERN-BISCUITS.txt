Title: HARRIET'S SOUTHERN BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Flour, plus 2 Tablespoons
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
2 tb Crisco
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1 tb Crisco, for frying pan
Mix the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Blend in the Crisco
until the mixture is coarse and grainy. Harriet uses a fork, but I
have better luck with a pastry blender. Then, using a fork, stir in
the buttermilk.  Do not overmix.

Put on a floured board and knead just a few times. Pat out the dough
to about 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with a biscuit cutter or a glass.
(Flour the cutter.)  Do not handle the dough too much, or it will get
tough.

Use a heavy black frying pan.  Place the 1 tablespoon of Crisco in the
frying pan and put the frying pan in the over for about 7 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven and place the biscuits in the pan. Turn
each once in the oil and bake the biscuits at 500 degrees for 10
minutes, or until light brown.
