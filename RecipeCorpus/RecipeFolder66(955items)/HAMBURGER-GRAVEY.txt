Contributed to the echo by: Marge Hamburger Gravy Okay... several
onions, maybe 2 large or three medium, very coarsely chopped. 1 pound
hamburger, probably ground chuck or leaner. Scramble/brown the
hamburger and onions together over medium heat, keeping the meat
chopped as finely as possible, you don't want big clumps in this,
until meat is cooked, and onion translucent. Drain off the excess
grease from the meat, trying to leave about a tablespoon or two in
the skillet. Sprinkle a scant two tablespoons of water over the meat
mixture, and stir it in well over low to medium heat. Add
approximately a cup and a half of water, and stir to blend. (You
might want to toss a bouillion cube in at this point, won't hurt it
any!) Simmer, stirring, until the "gravy" thickens... Taste and see
about adding a healthy shake or three of pepper and (if you omitted
the bouillion cube) a dash of salt. Won't hurt it to stay warm on the
back of the stove for a while while the potatoes finish boiling, the
flavor will go into the gravy more that way. Howzat for indefinite?
But there WAS no recipe...we just made it!
