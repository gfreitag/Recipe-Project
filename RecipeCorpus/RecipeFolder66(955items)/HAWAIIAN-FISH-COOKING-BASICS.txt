Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
1    (No Ingredients)
FISH: Select 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of 3/4" thick pieces AHI, HEBI, MAHI
MAHI, ONO, OPAH, SWORDFISH, or TOMBO. (Fish may have dark-colored
sections that are stronger flavored than lighter flesh.) Cut off and
discard any skin. Rinse fish, pat dry, and cut into pieces as recipes
direct. Rub fish all over with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

TO GRILL: Place oiled fish on a greased grill 4-6" above a solid bed
of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2-3
seconds). Cook fish, turning once or twice, until done to your liking
(cut to test). For rare (still the raw color in center), allow about
3 minutes total. To cook evenly (center slightly translucent), allow
5-6 minutes total.

TO SAUTE: Place a 10-12" nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan
is hot, add 1 teaspoon salad oil and oiled fish. (For 2 pounds fish,
cook half at a time.) Turn once or twice to brown and cook to your
liking (cut to test); drippings may scorch and smoke. For rare (still
the raw color in center), allow about 3 minutes total. To cook evenly
(center slightly translucent), allow 5-6 minutes total.
