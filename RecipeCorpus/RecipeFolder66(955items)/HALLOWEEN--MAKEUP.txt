Preparation : In bowl, mix 3 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 tablespoon
flour. Gradually stir in 3/4 cup Karo corn syrup and 1/4 cup water
until smooth. This amount will make up 4 children's faces. Divide
mixture between 4 paper cups. Color 3 batches with food colors of
your choice (1/2 teaspoon liquid or 1/4 teaspoon paste for each
batch). Leave 1 batch untinted.

For additional colors, prepare more makeup.  Separate tissues into
single layers; tear lengthwise into 2-inch wide strips. Using swabs
or brush, paint generous coat of untinted mixture on forehead; place
strip of tissue over area; pat firmly with fingertips. Brush on more
of same mixture to cover any dry spots on tissue. Continue painting
rest of face, one area at a time, and covering it with tissue.  Don't
paint eyelids or around eyes. Let dry about 15 minutes; time depends
on temperature and humidity.

Stir colored batches before using.  Paint on 1 color at a time as
desired. Let dry slightly before using another color if you want them
to blend, or let dry completely if you don't. To speed process, use
hair dryer on air setting.

For deeper, smoother, candy-color effect, use several coats of same
color (allow to dry slightly between coats).

TO BUILD UP EYEBROWS, nose or chin (or for beard) apple cotton to
damp, untinted mixture.  Paint with more of the same. Cover with
tissue and paint desired color.

FOR GHOULISH EFFECT, dust made-up face with flour.

FOR WARTS, stick on Puffed Wheat cereal with untinted mixture, then
coat with layers of mixture-soaked tissue. Paint desired color.

TO REMOVE MAKEUP, wet face, then gently peel tissue away. Wash face
with warm water.
