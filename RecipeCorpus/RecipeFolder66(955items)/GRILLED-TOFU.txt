Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings

1 lb Firm tofu
1/4 c  Orange juice
2 ts Low-sodium soy sauce
Cold and Spicy Noodles,
-See Recipe
Tofu, once pressed, grills beautifully. Joanie pressed and marinated
the tofu ahead of time; we grilled it on a portable hibachi.

Slice the block of tofu in half, then slice each half into four thick
slabs. Place a double layer of paper towels on a cutting board set
over the sink. Arrange tofu in one layer on the cutting board, then
top with a clean dishtowel. Place a second board on top, then a 4 to
5 pound weight, such as a thick phone book or heavy pot. Let press 20
minutes.

Uncover tofu and place in one layer in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle
with orange juice and soy sauce. Marinate at room temperature 20
minutes.

Broil or grill over hot coals until lightly browned, turning once.
Serve with Cold and Spicy Noodles.
