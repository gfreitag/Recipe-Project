: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REHYDRATE DRIED CHILES: Stem and
seed the chiles, then place them in a skillet, on a comal, or in a
250 degree oven and dry-roast them for 3 or 4 minutes. Shake them
once or twice and be careful not to scorch them or else they will
taste bitter; this in turn will make sauce taste bitter. The chiles
should then be added to water that has been heated t just below the
boiling point, if it is boiling, the chiles will lose flavor. Use
just enough water to cover the chiles and press them down with a lid.
Allow them to sit for 20 minutes or until they are soft. At this
point, you should taste the water to see if it is bitter, discarding
it if it is. The chiles can then be used as directed in the recipe.
: METHOD: Remove stems from the Guajillo. Roast and rehydrate the
chiles. Puree with the remaining ingredients. To use as a sauce, heat
2 tb peanut oil or lard in a high-sided pan and refry sauce at a
sizzle for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring continuously. Add a little water
if necessary. ---
