Title: HARVEY'S SAWMILL GRAVY
Categories: Breakfast, Meats, Sauces
1/8 ts Salt 3 tb All purpose
Yield: 4 Servings  4    (1.5 oz) hot sausage patties
flour 1/8 ts Pepper
1 1/2 c  Milk

In a saucepan, fry sausage patties, drain and keep warm. [I prefer to
use my 3-qt saute pan.]  Pour off all but two tablespoons grease.
Blend in flour and brown, stirring constantly. [I don't like to let
the roux get much past the yellow-gold stage.] Gradually add milk or
water, mixing well. [I prefer milk.] Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer. Crumble sausage patties and add to gravy along with salt and
pepper. Simmer two minutes. Serve over hot open-faced biscuits.
