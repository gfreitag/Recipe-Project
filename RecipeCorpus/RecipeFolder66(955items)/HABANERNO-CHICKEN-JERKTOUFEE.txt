:
2 TB Jamaican jerk sauce
1 pn black pepper

1 pn salt
1 ts dry jerk seasoning
1/2 c  vegetable oil
1/2 c  flour
1 qt heavy cream
2 c  chicken stock
1/3 c  tomato sauce
1/3 c  tasso or smoked ham

Season the chicken pieces with Poultry Magic. Melt 1/2 pound butter
in a 4-quart saucepan. Add the chicken pieces and saute until cooked,
about 7 minutes. Remove the chicken and drain it on paper towels.
Pour off the butter from the saucepan and then add all the vegetables
and seasonings. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
vegetables soften, about 10 to 15 minutes.

As the vegetables soften, make a roux. Heat the vegetable oil until it
begins to smoke. Reduce the heat and add a small amount of flour and
stir to combine. Keep adding the flour in small amounts until all the
flour is incorporated with the oil and the flour mixture is caramel
colored. Stir constantly to keep the roux from scorching.

When the vegetables have softened, add the cream, chicken stock,
tomato sauce, cooked chicken and tasso. Cook until the liquid has
reduced by half. Add the roux, one tablespoon at a time until the
mixture has thickened moderately. Stir in the rest of the butter, one
tablespoon at a time, until incorporated. Serve over a large square
of cornbread.
