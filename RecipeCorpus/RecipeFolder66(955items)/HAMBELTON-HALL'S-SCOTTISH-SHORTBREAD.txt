Categories: Beverages, Cookies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Plus 2T sugar
3/4 lb Sweet butter, room temp
3 1/4 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2/3 c  Sifted cornstarch
1.  In a large bowl, beat 1 cup of the sugar with the butter until
light and fluffy. 2. Sift together the flour and cornstarch and
gradually mix into the creamed butter. Gather the dough into a ball
and flatten into a disk. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for 1
hour. 3. Preheat oven to 225F. Trace a 12-inch circle on a large
baking sheet. Pat out the chilled dough to fit the circle, taking
care that the top is even and smooth. Score the top of the pastry
into 8 equal wedges. Press decorative designs into the edges, if
desired. 4. Bake the shortbread in the upper middle of the oven for
35 minutes; do not allow to color. Remove from the oven, sprinkle
with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and let cool on the sheet.
Break into wedges before serving.
