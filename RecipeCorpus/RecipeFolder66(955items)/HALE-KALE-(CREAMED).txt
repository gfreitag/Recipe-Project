with calcium, iron and vitamin C. 1. Blanch kale (about 2 min.) in
boiling water until tender. Rinse in ice water and cut into 1/2-inch
ribbons. 2. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the kale,
milk and nutmeg. Simmer 2 min. Reduce heat to low and cook for 5
min., or until the milk has reduced and thickened. Stirin sour cream
and season to taste with pepper.
