Title: GULYAS SATURDAY NIGHT
Categories: Soups, Hungarian
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Bacon grease
1    Green chile; (opt, julienne)
2 lg Onion; chopped
2    Garlic clove; smashed &
-chopped
1 tb Paprika, Hungarian
3/4 lb Flank steak; cubed
3/4 lb Pork; cubed
2 c  Tomato; canned
Pepper, black
Garlic salt; to taste
Sour cream; for garnish
In large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, saut peppers & onions in the
bacon drippings until onions are translucent. Make a space, and add
garlic directly to the hot surface, stirring until fragrant. Now add
the paprika and stir it all until it loses its raw smell. Add cubed
meats, canned tomatoes and a hefty grinding of pepper and stir. When
mixture reaches a simmer, cover and allow to cook for 1 to 1-1/2
hours, until meat is tender. Check after 45 minutes; if there seems
to be too much liquid, leave cover off to reduce sauce. And if, when
the meat is tender, there is still too much sauce, thicken it in the
following manner: remove a cup or so of liquid and stir into it
perhaps a teaspoon of arrowroot; return all to pan and stir until
thickened nicely. Serve on noodles if you like, although they're not
absolutely necessary. Suggestion: serve WITH fresh, steamed green
beans, left whole.
