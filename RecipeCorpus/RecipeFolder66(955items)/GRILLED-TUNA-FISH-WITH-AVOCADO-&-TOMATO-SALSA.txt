Title: GRILLED TUNA FISH WITH AVOCADO & TOMATO SALSA
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
10    Cherry tomatoes
1    Red pepper
1    Green chilli (or to taste)
1    Ripe, firm avocado
Olive oil
Salt and pepper
4    Tuna steaks, cut from the
-belly
2 tb Chopped chives
1 tb Coriander leaves
2    Lemons or limes
Roughly chop the tomatoes, pepper and chilli and place in a bowl. Cut
the avocado in half and, with your hand wrapped in a tea towel for
protection, hold the half with the stone in it. Lightly tap the stone
with a sharp knife so that the blade lodges in the stone. Twist the
knife and the stone should come away easily. Slice the flesh from
both halves into chunks and add to the chopped ingredients. Pour over
a generous amount of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and set
aside.

Grill the tuna steaks for two minutes on each side, or longer if you
don't want them too underdone. Remember that the fish will continue
cooking a little even when you remove it from the heat. Season with
salt and pepper on both sides and allow to rest in a warm oven.

To serve, divide the salsa equally on four plates, place the tuna
steaks on top, sprinkle with the chives and coriander and serve with
half a lemon or lime.
