Heat oven to 375 F. Line 15-1/2x10-1/2x1-inch jelly roll pan with
foil; generously grease foil. In large mixer bowl, beat egg yolks on
medium speed of electric mixer 3 minutes; gradually add 1/2 cup
sugar, beating 2 additional minutes. Stir together flour, cocoa, 1/4
cup sugar, baking soda and salt; add to egg yolk mixture alternately
with water, beating on low speed just until batter is smooth. Stir in
vanilla; set aside. In small mixer bowl, beat egg whites until soft
peaks form; gradually add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, beating until
stiff peaks form. Gradually fold beaten egg whites into chocolate
mixture until well blended. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan.
Bake 14 to 16 minutes or until top springs back when touched lightly.
Immediately loosen cake from edges of pan; invert onto clean,
slightly dampened towel. Carefully peel off foil. Cool completely.
Meanwhile, prepare PUMPKIN FILLING. Cut cake crosswise into four
equal pieces. Place one piece on serving plate; spread about 3/4 cup
PUMPKIN FILLING over top. Repeat layering with remaining cake and
filling, ending with cake layer. Spread CHOCOLATE GLAZE over top;
garnish with almonds, if desired. Refrigerate until serving time.
Refrigerate leftovers. 8 to 10 servings.

PUMPKIN FILLING: In small saucepan, combine pumpkin and flour; cook
over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils (mixture
will be very thick). Remove from heat; set aside. Cool completely. In
small mixer bowl, beat butter and shortening until creamy; add
spices. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating until light and fluffy.
Slowly blend in pumpkin mixture. Refrigerate until mixture ready to
use. About 2-1/4 cups filling.

CHOCOLATE GLAZE: In small saucepan over low heat, melt butter; add
cocoa and water. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens.
Do not boil. Remove from heat; gradually add powdered sugar and
vanilla, beating with whisk until smooth. Add additional water, 1/2
teaspoon at a time, until of desired consistency. About 1/2 cup glaze.
