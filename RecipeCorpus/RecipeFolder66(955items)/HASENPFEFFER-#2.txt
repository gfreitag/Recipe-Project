-JUDI M. PHELPS (G.PHELPS1)
4 lb Rabbit
1 1/2 c  Dry red wine
3/4 c  Cider vinegar
2 ts Salt; optional
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  Onions; chopped
1 tb Mixed pickling spice
1/2 c  Flour
4 tb Butter
1 c  Onions; thinly sliced
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Sour cream
Cut rabbit in serving-sized pieces.  Wash, scrape, and soak in
salted cold water for 1 hour.  Drain and dry.

In a glass or pottery bowl mix together the wine, vinegar, salt,
pepper, bay leaf, chopped onions, and pickling spice. Add the rabbit
and let marinate in the refirgerator for 3 days. Turn the pieces
occasinally. Drain the rabbit; strain and reserve the marinade. Dry
the rabbit with paper towels and roll in flour.

Melt butter in a Dutch oven or deep heavy skillet; brown the rabbit
and sliced onions in it.  Pour off fat and add sugar and 1-1/2 cups
marinade. Cover and cook over low heat 1-1/2 hours or until rabbit is
tender. Turn the pieces occasionally and add more marinade if needed.
Taste for seasoning.  Mix the sour cream into the gravy just before
serving.
