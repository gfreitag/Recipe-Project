Yield: 16 Servings
1 c  Butter, sweet
1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Sugar, brown, dark
2 lg Egg
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 1/2 c  Flour

Drain plums well, reserve syrup and chop plums.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter
until creamy and light, then gradually add the sugars, beating until
creamy and smooth.  Beat in the eggs, then the vanilla. Sift all dry
ingredients together; stir into the butter mixture, alternating with
1/2 cup of the reserved syrup, beginning and ending with dry
ingredients. Stir in the plums.  Pour the batter into a greased 9" x
13" baking pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick tests
clean. Turn the cake out of the pan and cool on a wire rack. Dust
with confectioners' sugar.
