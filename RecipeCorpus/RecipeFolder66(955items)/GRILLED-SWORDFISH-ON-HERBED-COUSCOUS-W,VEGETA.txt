HERBED COUSCOUS:

1    Bay leaf
1 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
1/2 ts Chopped fresh rosemary

1 ts Olive oil
1 c  Couscous
SWORDFISH:
1 1/2 lb Fresh swordfish (4 6-oz

Sprigs of fresh thyme or
Rosemary, for garnish (opt.)
To make the vegetable minestrone, heat the oil in a large saucepan
over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook just until it starts to
sizzle; do not brown. Add the herbs, juice, stock and peper and bring
to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes. Set aside.

To make the couscous, combine the stock, pepper, herbs and oil in a
small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the couscous, mix well and
remove from the heat. Cover tightly and allow to stand for at least 5
minutes, or until all of the liquid has been absorbed. Set aside.

Wash the swordfish and pat it dry.  Rub the surface with a little
olive oil and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground black pepper and
herbs, if desired. Cook over a charcoal grill or under a broiler just
until it turns from translucent to opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes per
side. Do not overcook or the fish will become tough.

To serve, place a rounded 1/2 cup of couscous on each of 4 plates and
top with a piece of grilled swordfish. Spoon the minestrone around
each serving, dividing it equally. Garnish each serving with a sprig
of fresh thyme or rosemary, if desired.
