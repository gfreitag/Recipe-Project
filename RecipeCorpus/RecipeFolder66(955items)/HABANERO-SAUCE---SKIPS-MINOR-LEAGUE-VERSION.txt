Title: HABANERO SAUCE - SKIPS MINOR LEAGUE VERSION
Categories: Chiles, Sauces
Yield: 2 Cups
1/2 c  Cider vinegar
1/2    Onion
1 cl Garlic
1/2    Grated carrot
12    Habaneros, cored
1 ts Olive oil
1/3 c  Chicken broth
1/4 c  Tequila gold
1 ts Leaf oregano
Lawrey's seasoned salt
1/4 ts Worstershire sauce
1/2 c  Honey
cook the onions in the olive oil until they just start to turn
golden. half way through this process add the grated carrot. Then add
the minced garlic and stir for a minute, just to soften it. Add the
oregano at this time as well. Stir over moderate heat for about a
minute. Add the habaneros and the vinegar, bring to a simmer, cover
and cook about 10 minutes until the habs are soft. take off the heat
and cool a little bit. Put in the blender and blend thoroughly.

Put back in the pot and bring to a simmer again. add chicken broth,
worstershire sauce, and honey. salt to taste. Add the tequila and
cook long enough to take away the raw alcohol flavor.

it's pretty hot but the carrots and honey make it so you can taste the
flavor of the habs without scorching yourself in the process. The
chicken broth and tequila ensure that it's not too vinegary.

I'm going to try a variation on this with my jalapeno crop when it
comes due... I'll let you know.  Walt - MM - Chile-Heads
