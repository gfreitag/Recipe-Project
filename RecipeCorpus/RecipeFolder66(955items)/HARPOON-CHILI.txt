Great chili to make with friends.  Makes about 16 cups. Substitute
2-1/2 to 3 cups each white and blanck beans, cooked. Use garbanzos
instead of navy or white kidney. You may want to add a 2nd bottle of
Ale to the Chili when it needs it. If you don't like eggplant, or
can't find it, use 2 zucchini. Need about 3 to 4 cups of diced
eggplant/zucchini. Ifyou want to make vegetarian chili, omit the
chicken.

1. Heat oil over low flame in a heavy-bottomed stockpot. Add onion,
garlic, and spices and cook, covered, until golden, about 15 minutes.

2. Add eggplant and cook, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

3. Add beans, Harpoon ale, oregano, and tomatoes. Cook, covered, over
medium heat for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook for 2 to 3
hours (or less if using already cooked beans), partly covered, making
sure all beans are completely soft.

4. Add chicken and peppers and cook until just heated.

6. Serve with a dollop of (soft) goat cheese and fresh cilantro.
