"Most kids don't like fruit cake, so I have devised a moist version
of a classic gumdrop cake. Freeze the cake until Christmas or
refrigerate up to two weeks."

Preheat the oven to 350F. Cut the gumdrops into small pieces *(get
your kids to do this); leaving out the black ones. In a small bowl,
toss with the raisins and
1/2 c  flour. Reserve.
In a separate bowl, combine the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon,
nutmeg, and salt with the remaining flour.
In a large bowl, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Gradually
beat in the sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.
Stir in the applesauce, flour mixture and lemon rind. Fold in the
gumdrop and raisin mixture.
Butter a 9 X 5 inch loaf pan and line with buttered wax or parchment
paper. Pour in the batter.
Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or till knife inserted comes out clean.
Turn out the cake and let it cool completely. Wrap well with foil and
store for 1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Freeze if keeping longer
than 2 weeks. MAKES: 1 loaf
