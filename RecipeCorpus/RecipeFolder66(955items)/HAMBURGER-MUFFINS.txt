Title: HAMBURGER MUFFINS
Categories: Meats, Children
Yield: 24 Servings
1 1/4 lb Hamburger
10 oz Can cream of mushroom soup
1    Egg
Chopped onion,to taste
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
3/4 c  Grated yellow cheese
Salt and pepper,to taste
1    Loave,white or brown bread
Mix together all ingredients, except bread.  Cut the crusts off very
fresh bread slices.  Butter 1 side only; with buttered side down,
line muffin tins with bread slices, making sure you don't break the
bread at the bottom.  Fill each muffin cup with a good tablespoon of
hamburger filling. Bake at 350F for 30 mins. They can be frozen, then
reheated, or can be served cold.  I use a lean ground beef.
