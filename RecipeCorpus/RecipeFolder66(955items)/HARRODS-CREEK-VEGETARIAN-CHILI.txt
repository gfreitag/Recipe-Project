medium heat. Add onion, cook until translucent. Add celery, carrots,
tomatoes, lemon juice, and spices. Cook until vegetables are tender,
about 10-15 minutes. Add diced green pepper and cook another ten
minutes. Add kidney beans, garbanzo beans, bulgur wheat mixture and

minutes over low heat. If too thick, add water as needed and stir
occasionally so the bulgur doesn't stick.
