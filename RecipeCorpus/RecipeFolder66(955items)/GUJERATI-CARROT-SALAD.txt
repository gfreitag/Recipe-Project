This is a Madhur Jeffrey recipe, published in the Toronto Sun.
"Jaffrey was in town last week teaching at the Bonnie Stern School of
Cooking. Using ingredients available locally, primarily in the shops
along Gerrardjust west of Coxwell, she wowed the classes with her
masterful teaching, attention to detail and wonderful aromatic
dishes. She also proved how good and easy Indian cooking can be. ...
Jaffrey taught us how roasting, crushing and grinding bring out
different qualities in a spice. Crushing mustard seeds, for example,
brings out their heat but tossing them 'til they pop in hot oil calms
the heat and brings out a sweet nuttiness. Black mustard seeds, the
finest mustard seeds are essential and inexpensive ingredient, found
in Indian groceries."

Trim and peel and grate carrots. In a bowl, toss with salt and set
aside. In a small heavy pan over medium heat, heat oil. When very
hot, add mustard seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to pop, in a few
seconds, pour oil and seeds over carrots. Add lemon juice and toss.
SERVES:4 Serve at room temperature or cold.
