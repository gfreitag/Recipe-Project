Title: HALIBUT POACHED WITH VERMOUTH & THYME
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 lb Halibut steak
1/4 c  Vermouth, dry; mixed with
1/4 c  ;Water
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 tb Olive oil
1 ts Thyme, dried
1/4 c  Leek; white only, quartered
1    Celery rib; thickly sliced
2    Garlic clove; sliced
2    Bay leaves
Rinse the halibut and place in a shallow pan large enough to hold it
in a single layer.  Add the vermouth and water, lemon juice, olive
oil, and enough water (or court bouillon) just to cover the fish.
Remove the fish and bring the poaching liquid to a boil.  Add the
thyme, onion, celery, garlic, and bay leaves to the poaching liquid
and bring back to a boil over high heat.  Lay the halibut back in the
pan in a single layer. Cover the pan and return to a boil, then
reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the
thickness of the fish. Remove fish from the pan, draining well, and
serve immediately.
