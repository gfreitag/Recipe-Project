Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings  ~-------------------------CHICKEN--------------------------
4 ea Boneless chicken breasts,
1 x  Skin on
4 ea Firm bananas, skin on
1 x  And halved lengthwise
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Soft butter
2 tb Molasses
1 x  Lime halves for garnish -------------------------SPICE
RUB-------------------------
3 tb curry powder
2 tb paprika
1 tb cayenne pepper
2 tb freshly cracked black pepper
3 tb ground cumin
2 tb powdered ginger
2 tb salt

Mix all the spices together well.  Rub this mixture over both sides
of each chicken breast, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours. Over a
medium fire, grill the chicken breasts skin side down for 7 to 8
minutes, until well browned and heavily crusted. Turn them and grill
an additional 10 minutes. Check for doneness by nicking the largest
breast at the fattest point: The meat should be fully opaque with no
trace of red. Remove the chicken from the grill. Rub the banana
halves with vegetable oil and place them on the grill flat side down.
Grill them for about 2 minutes, or until the flat sides are slightly
golden in color. Flip them and grill for an additional 2 minutes.
Remove the banana halves from the grill. Mix the butter and molasses
together and paint this over the bananas. Serve the chicken breasts
and the banana halves together, sprinkled with a little lime juice.
