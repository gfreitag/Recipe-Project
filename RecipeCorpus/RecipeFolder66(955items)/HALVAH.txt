Title: HALVAH
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
3 c  Water
2 c  Granulated sugar
1    Cinnamon stick
3    Whole cloves
1    Lemon (peel only)
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Coarse semolina or farina
4 tb Pine nuts
2 tb Blanched, chopped almonds
3 tb Whole blanched almonds
Combine the water, sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, and lemon peel (or 1
tablespoon lemon juice) in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil
for 10 minutes, then cool. Meanwhile, slowly melt the butter in a
heavy saucepan, and cook for several minutes, without browning.
Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly add the semolina or
farina. Cook over low heat until the mixture turns a golden chestnut
color; do not brown. Add 2 tablespoons of the pine nuts and chopped
almonds and continue cooking 1 more minute. Remove cinnamon stick,
cloves, and peel from the cooled syrup. Gradually add the syrup to
the semolina mixture, stirring with a long-handled wooden spoon; the
mixture will bubble furiously. Cook over the lowest possible heat
until the syrup has been absorbed and the mixture thickens. Remove
from the heat and drape with a clean towel for 10 minutes. Turn into
a mold, spreading with a knife or a spatula. Cool, then reverse onto
a serving platter, sprinkle with cinnamon, and garnish decoratively
with the remaining pine nuts and the whole almonds. Cut into small,
diamond-shaped pieces.
