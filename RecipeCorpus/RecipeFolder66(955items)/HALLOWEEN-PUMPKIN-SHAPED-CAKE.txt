Title: HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN-SHAPED CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Kids, Holidays
Yield: 1 Cake
2 pk Cake mix, prepared
2 cn White frosting
Food coloring
1    Hostess Ho-Ho (or similar
-cake-roll snack item)
This is actually more a method than a recipe, but given the recent
requests for Halloween goodies I thought it might be of interest. I
originally saw this in Parents Magazine about two years ago.  It has
been a favorite for our family celebrations since then!

Prepare two cakes in bundt pans, cool completely. Color most of the
frosting a deep orange, reserving about 1/2 c , which should be
colored black (you may also use dark chocolate fudge frosting). Place
one bundt cake upside down (rounded side on the bottom) on cake
plate; frost top only.  Place second bundt cake flat-side down on top
of first cake. Frost entire cake with orange frosting, making up and
down motions with spatula to simulate pumpkin. Insert Ho-Ho in the
middle of the top of the bundt cake to make the stem. Use black
frosting to make eyes, nose, mouth, etc. Black rope licorice may also
be used.
