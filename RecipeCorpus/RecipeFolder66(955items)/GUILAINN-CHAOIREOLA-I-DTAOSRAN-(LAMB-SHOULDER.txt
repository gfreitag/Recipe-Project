Title: GUILAINN CHAOIREOLA I DTAOSRAN (LAMB SHOULDER
Categories: Ireland, Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
12 oz Shortcrust or flaky pastry
3 lb Boned shoulder of lamb
6 tb Butter
1 tb Mixed chopped herbs
Salt and black pepper
Milk or egg to glaze
Make the pastry and chill for at least 1 hour before using. See that
the lamb is fairly free of fat, and securely tied: put in a roasting
pan and rub with about a third of the butter. Put into a very hot
oven, 450F for 20-30 minutes. Take out and allow to cool slightly. --
Miz the remaining butter with the herbs, salt and pepper. Roll out
the pastry to a piece large enough to wrap around the joint.
Carefully remove the string from the lamb, trying to retain the
shape. Put it in the center of the pastry, dampen the edges, and draw
the pastry up over the top: secure well by squeezing the pastry ends
and edges together. Turn over so that the fold is underneath, and put
on a baking sheet. Prick all over the top lightly with a fork, then
brush with either the milk or beaten egg. Put into 400F oven and cook
for about 1/2 hour, or until the pastry is nicely browned. Turn the
sheet once during baking to make sure the browning is even. Serve,
cut into fairly thick slices.
