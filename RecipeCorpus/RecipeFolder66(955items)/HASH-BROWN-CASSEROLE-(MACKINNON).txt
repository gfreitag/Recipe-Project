Make ahead casserole from Caterer Pat MacKinnon of Pat's Palatables in
Summerville, SC.

Mix thoroughly the hash browns, onions, cheese, sour cream, soup,
salt, pepper and 4 ounces of the margarine, melted. Place in a
greased 3-quart casserole dish. Cover top with breadcrumbs and pour
remaining 4 ounces margarine over the top. Bake at 350 degrees for
about 1 hour and 10 minutes. -- MacKinnon also shares a recipe for
Hash Brown Casserole, a popular side dish that goes with any meat.
Cooked regular potatoes don't freeze well, she says, but this dish,
made with frozen hash browns, makes a great keeper in the freezer.

MacKinnon thaws the casserole for about an hour before baking then
covers it loosely with foil for about half the baking time. The
casserole is done when it's bubbling and browned on top.
