Recipe by: Doug Weller <eat@RAMTOPS.DEMON.CO.UK> In a large bowl,
combine the ground lamb with the bread, allspice, coriande garlic,
onion, savory, and salt and pepper, and knead thoroughly. The mixtu
should be spicy, though not too herby, and hold its shape. Break into
5 sections, each as large as a navel orange, then break each section
into 6 b Knead and flatten slightly to a thickness of about 3/4. Cut
the bacon slice widths equal to these balls, keeping the slices of
bacon between them. Slip cane skewer through the centers and roll
gently with the palms to smooth th edges. (There will be 5 or 6
skewers, depending on their length.) Cover and refrigerate overnight.
When ready to cook, set on a broiler tray or grill a cook under
moderate heat, turning every 5 minutes.

(The bacon will baste the meat.) The surface will be crusty and the
inside cooked within 25 minutes. To serve: Put out the bread, meat,
tomatoes seasoned with the vinegar and oil, parsley and yogurt in
separate dishes. Guests may open pocket bread and stuff them with
meat and seasonings.

6    Servings.
