Remove florets from broccoli rabe and cut stems and leaves into 1-inch
pieces. In a 10-inch to 12-inch saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons extra
virgin olive oil until just smoking. Toss scallions and cook 2
minutes, stirring often until just wilted. Add broccoli rabe and
sweet vermouth and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes, until scallions
are quite soft. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside and allow to
cool to room temperature. In a blender, add sundried tomatoes,
soaking water, balsamic vinegar, capers and 1/4 cup extra virgin
olive oil and blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Remove from blender
and set aside.

Clean soft shell crabs by cutting off face and removing. Season with
black pepper and throw onto grill. Cook until crisp and bright red
(about 5 minutes each side). Meanwhile, divide rabe/scallion mixture
among 4 plates. Place 3 crabs on each plate, drip 2 tablespoons
tomato pesto around crabs and serve immediately.
