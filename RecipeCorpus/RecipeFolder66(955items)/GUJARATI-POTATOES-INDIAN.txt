Gujarat is a part of India on the western coast, right at the Tropic
of Cancer, between 20 and 25 deg. N. latitude. This recipe, adapted
from Madhur Jaffrey, uses only one "mystery ingredient," asafoetida
powder (you should find some if you're going to get into Indian
cooking at all.)

Jaffrey says use two pounds of medium, very waxy boiling potatoes. I
used one pound but left everything else the same and it was perfect
for two hungry people.

Peel potatoes (optional) and cut into long French-fries 3/8" (9mm)
square. Dunk in a bowl of cold water for 1/2 hour. Peel and sliver
garlic. Heat the oil in a 9- or 10-inch skillet over medium. Drain
and pat dry the potato fingers. Put potatoes in hot oil and turn
occasionally for 8 or 10 minutes to partially cook -- not brown.

Remove potatoes with tongs or slotted spoon to a plate with a paper
towel on it. From here on you have to move kind of fast: throw the
sesame seeds into the skillet, stir once. Add the garlic, and
continue to stir. When it =just= begins to turn brown, quickly add
turmeric and asafoetida, and stir once more.

After just a couple of seconds put the potatoes back in, with salt and
cayenne or hot powder. Reduce heat and cook gently until done. Stir
frequently. (I added a tiny bit of water and loosely covered the
skillet with a plate during the last few minutes.)
