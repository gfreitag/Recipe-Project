bay leaf and white wine. Cover and cook over low heat for 1 hour. Add
small additional amounts of water if needed. Add the potatoes and
stir gently. Cover and cook over low heat for 20 minutes. Correct
seasoning. Add the peas, olives, and pimentos and cook over low heat
for 10 minutes.

Note: The flavour will be greatly improved if the stew is prepared
early in the day and reheated before serving.
