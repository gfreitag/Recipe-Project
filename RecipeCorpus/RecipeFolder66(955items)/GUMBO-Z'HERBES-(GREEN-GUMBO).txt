Wash fresh greens; tear into small pieces.  Remove large stalks and
ribs. (If using frozen greens, thaw and drain before proceeding).
Place cleaned or thawed greens, cabbage, bay leaves, basil, thyme,
oregano, allspice, cloves, and nutmeg into a large soup pot. Add
stock and enough water to cover greens by 3 inches. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat. Cover; simmer while preparing remaining ingredients.
Prepare Seasoning Mix. Cut pork and ham into bite-size pieces. Add
meats to Seasoning Mix. Shake to coat lightly. Set seasoned meat
aside while oil heats. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over
medium-high heat. When oil is very hot, add seasoned meat; stir until
brown on all sides.  Remove browned meat with a slotted spoon; add to
simmering greens.  Reduce heat to medium; add onions, celery, bell
pepper, and garlic to skillet. Cook until vegetables are wilted,
about 5 minutes. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon; add to
simmering greens. Stir in sugar; simmer, uncovered for one hour.
Season to taste with salt, black pepper and cayenne. Cover; simmer 2
hours. About 10 minutes before serving, GENTLY stir in oysters with
their liquor, green onions, and parsley. Cook until edges of oysters
curl. Spoon about 1/2 cup rice into each soup bowl. Spoon gumbo over
rice; top with a pinch of file powder. Makes 8-10 good-sized
servings.

bag and shake to combine.
