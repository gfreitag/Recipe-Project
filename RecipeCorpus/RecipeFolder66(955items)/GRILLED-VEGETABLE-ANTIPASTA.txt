Make the marinade: in a bowl whisk together the ingredients.

In a large shallow glass or ceramic baking dish, arrange the
vegetables. Add the marinade, turning the vegetables to coat with the
marinade, and let stand, covered and chilled, for at least 2 hours,
or overnight. Drain vegetables reserving marinade.

Heat grill pan over moderately high heat until hot. Add vegetables and
grill, in batches, for 3 - 4 minutes on each side, or until tender.
Transfer vegetables to a serving dish, drizzle with remaining
marinade and sprinkle with parsley. Garnish with olives and Parmesan
shavings.
