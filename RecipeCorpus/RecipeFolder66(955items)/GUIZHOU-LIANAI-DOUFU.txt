MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 tb Peanut oil
1 tb Finely chopped garlic
1 tb Minced peeled fresh ginger
1 tb Dark soy sauce
1 tb Rice wine
2 ts Light soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Chicken stock
1 ts Cornstarch; mixed with
1 ts Water
2 ts Sesame oil
DRAIN THE BEAN CURD AND CUT IT into 2-inch squares. Set to drain
further on paper towels. Heat a wok or large saute pan until is is
hot. Add the oil and all the filling ingredients and stir-fry for 1
minute. Put the cooked ingredients in a bowl and allow them to cool
thoroughly. Heat a wok or large saute pan until it is hot. Add the 2
cups oil and, when it is hot, deep-fry the bean curd on both sides
until it is golden brown. Remove the bean curd squares from the wok,
drain them well on paper towels, and allow them to cool thoroughly.
Drain and discard the oil. Take each of the bean curd squares and,
with a knife, split it slightly open on one side so a pocket is
formed. Place a spoonful of cooked filling in each of the pockets.
Continue to fill the squares until you have used all the bean curd.
Wipe the wok clean, reheat, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Then add the
garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Then add the rest of
the ingredients except the cornstarch mixture and sesame oil. Bring
the mixture to a boil, return the fried bean curd pieces and cook
over medium heat for 3 minutes. Now add the cornstarch mixture, stir
gently to combine, and then add the sesame oil. Give the mixture a
final turn and serve at once. Serves 4 as part of Chinese meal, or 2
as a single dish.
