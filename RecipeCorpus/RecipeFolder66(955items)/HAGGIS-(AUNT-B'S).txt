Title: HAGGIS (AUNT B'S)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
Sheep's pluck (heart,liver
And lights)
2    Teacupfuls toasted oatmeal
1 ts Salt
8 oz Shredded suet
Stomach bag of sheep
2    Onions
1/2 ts Black pepper
Clean the bag thoroughly,washing well in cold water,then in warm and
scraping till fresh.Then soak it overnight in cold water to which a
little salt has been added.Well wash the pluck,and put on to boil
with sufficient cold water to cover.See that the windpipe hangs over
the side of the pot, so that any impurities may escape.Boil 1 1/2 to
2 hours,remove from water and allow to cool.Retain a pint of the
liquid for use afterwards.Now cut away the windpipe, and any
superfluous gristle.Chop the heart and lights and grate half the
liver (the rest is not required for the haggis.Mix with the shredded
suet and the onions (which have been par-boiled and finely chopped )
then the oatmeal toasted to a pale brown in the oven or in front of
the fire.Add the pepper and salt mix thoroughly, then stir in the
pint of pluck liquid.Now fill into the bag which should be only
slightly more than half full in order to allow room for swelling.Sew
up the hole securely with needle and thread and place in a pan of
boiling water big enough to take the haggis comfortably. If liked a
glass of milk can be added to the water in which it is boiled. To
prevent the bag from bursting,prick it occasionally all over as it
boils. Continue to boil steadily without a lid for three hours.If the
haggis is not to be used right away remove from pan and place on a
flat dish.Later reheat by boiling it steadily for at least half an
hour.Serve on a folded napkin placed on a hot dish and before serving
make a three cornered gash in the top so that the serving spoon can
be inserted easily.Serve with potatoes (cooked in their jackets or
mashed),mashed turnip and brussels sprouts.If sheep's bag is not
available,pack mixture into a basin ,cover with greaseproof paper and
a scalded cloth and steam steadily for four to five hours.
