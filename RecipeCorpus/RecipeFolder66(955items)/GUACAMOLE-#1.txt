Title: GUACAMOLE #1
Categories: Dips, Mexican
Yield: 5 Servings
1    Yellow Onion Quartered
1    Juice Of 1/2 A Lemon
1/3 c  Mayonnaise
1/2 ts Crushed Chili Peppers
1/2 ts Salt

Put the metal blade chopping in your food procesor, then place the
onion, lemon juice, mayonnaise, chili peppers and salt in the work
bowl. Run the processor nonstop for 10 seconds. The onion should be
minced, and the other ingredients blended together. Use a tablespoon
to scoop out large chunks of avocado into the work bowl. Clean out
each avocado shell as thoroughly as possible.  Distribute the chunks
of avocado around the chopping blade of the food processor. Pulse
process two or three times, until the mixture is churned, but lumpy
(like cottage cheese).
