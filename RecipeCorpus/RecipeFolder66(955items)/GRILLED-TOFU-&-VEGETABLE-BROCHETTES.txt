For the marinade add scallions, garlic and ginger to a food processor
or blender and pulse until finely chopped (can also be done by hand)

In a small skillet, heat the olive oil and stir-fry scallions mixture
for a minute or two. Stir in the soy sauce and sugar and bring to a
boil. Off heat, cool slightly and stir in sesame oil and red chile
flakes, if using.. Cool and pour over the tofu cubes and marinate for
at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Soak bamboo skewers in water for
at least 30 minutes and then attractively thread pieces of marinated
tofu, mushrooms, peppers and onions on skewers. Brush vegetables with
leftover marinade and then grill or broil until vegetables are crisp
and tender. Serve with Sesame Spinach.

Yield: 4-6 serving
