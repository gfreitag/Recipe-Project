Title: HAM & CHEESE CHICKEN ROLLS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Boneless skinless chicken
Breast halves
4    Ham slices, extra lean
4    Swiss cheese slices -- very
Thin
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 ds Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper -- fresh
Ground
1/4 ts Lemon pepper -- optional
1/2 c  Soft bread crumbs
1    Egg
2 1/2 tb Canola oil -- or peanut
1. Skin the chicken breasts and pound to 1/4 inch between sheets of
waxed paper. 2. Lay one slice of fully cooked thin ham on chicken,
then one slice of very thin Swiss cheese. Roll up very carefully;
secure with wet toothpicks or tie twine around tightly. Unwaxed
dental floss makes a good tie. 3. Mix the flour, pepper, salt and
lemon-pepper (optional). Dust this over the chicken rolls lightly.
Dip one at a time into the beaten egg. Roll in the bread crumbs. 4.
Heat the oil in a 9 or 10-inch heavy skillet with lid. Place the
chicken rolls into hot oil, seam side down. Saute about 10 minutes,
turning carefully once or twice. 5. Add 2 tablespoons of water or
chicken broth, cover immediately, and turn heat to simmer. Simmer for
10-15 minutes. Remove from pan, let stand 3-4 minutes, then carefully
remove the toothpicks or twine. Serve warm.
