Title: GYROS  *** KJNX92A
Categories: Lamb, Greek, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Beef ;or lamb
4 ea Green onion; finely chopped
1 ea Cl Garlic ; minced
1 ts Oregano,
1/4 ts Cumin,
1/4 ts Parsley
1 ts Salt,
1/4 ts Pepper ; freshly ground,
8 ea Lg Pita
(recipe follows).  Mix all ingredients except pita, mixing well and
kneading until m;ixture is stiff.  On skewer pack meat mixture about
5" long and not more than 2" in diam. Put as many "fingers" as
possible on a skewer leav- ing a 1" space in between.  Cook over hot
coals o 10 to 15 mintues,  turning frequently.. Take pita and slide
gyro onto center. Drizzle with sauce.  Fold over to eat SAUCE:   Mix
together 1 cup yogurt, 2 Tbp. mayo,  juice of 1 lemon, 2 scal- lions
incl. green tops, finely chopped. I have another recipe that gives
the following for the meat mixture:   2# lean ground lamb,  2  slices
homemade gread toasted and crumbled; 1 tsp. crushed allspice, 1 tsp.
crushed corian- der seed1 clove pressed garlic; 1 grated onion; 1
tsp. chopped fresh savory; salt and freshly ;ground pepper.   This
latter recipe also suggests wrapping the "fingers" on the skewer with
sliced bacon. If anyone tries this, let me know how it works out. I
have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S.,  but as I have
said, I view it as a "deli" item. Krinos Foods has a "gyros kit" that
is sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets. FROM:    C
