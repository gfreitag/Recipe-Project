Yield: 40 Balls
MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------
~Jewish, Africa, Morocco
1 lb Hazelnuts, shelled
1/2 lb Almonds, shelled
1/2 lb Pitted dates
1/2 lb White raisins

1.  In a processor, coarsely grind the nuts together. Add the dates
and raisins.  Continue to grind everything together until you reach a
consistency that is smooth but still has some texture.

2.  Prepare balls of the mixture about 3/4-inch in diameter. Put each
ball on a small square of wax paper.

Serve when wanted during Passover.

Passover is a difficult time for desserts since most sweets are
"hamatz" or forbidden.  The Moroccan have solved part of the problem
with these delectable dates and nut balls.
