Categories: Breads, Fruits, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Italian
Yield: 40 Bread stix
1 pk Active dry yeast
2/3 c  ;Warm water (abt. 110 F.)
1/2 ts Anise seeds; crushed
2 tb Salad oil
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 ts Grated lemon peel
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour (approx.)
2/3 c  Pine nuts
1    Egg; lightly beaten
2 tb Coarse salt
In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water; let stand for about 5
minutes to soften.  Stir in anise seeds, salad and olive oils, lemon
peel, salt, sugar and 1 cup of flour. Beat until smooth. Add pine
nuts and enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough.

Turn out onto a floured board and knead until smooth and elastic
(about 5 minutes), using additional flour as needed. Place dough in a
greased bowl; turn dough to grease top. Cover with plastic wrap and
let rise in a warm place until doubled (about 1 hour).

Punch dough down and divide in half.  Cut each half into 20 equal-size
pieces.  Using palms of hands, roll each piece into a 7" length. Place
parallel and about 1/2" apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let
rise until puffy (about 30 minutes).  Brush with egg and sprinkle
lightly with salt.

Bake at 325 F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve
hot or cool on wire racks.  Store airtight at room temperature for 3
to 4 days; freeze for longer storage.
