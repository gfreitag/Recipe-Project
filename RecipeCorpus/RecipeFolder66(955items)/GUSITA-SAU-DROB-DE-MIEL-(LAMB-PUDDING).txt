Title: GUSITA SAU DROB DE MIEL (LAMB PUDDING)
Categories: Meats, Romanian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  Lambs toung heart & liver
1 x  Onion, large, chopped
1 tb Bland lard*see note*
5 x  Slices dutch toast*note*
5 x  Eggs
1 x  Parsley, to taste
1 x  Salt and pepper, to taste
Parboil tounge and remove skin and any veins. Cut up lungs, heart,
toung and livers into small chunks; sautee onion in lard*NOTE* what
they call bland lard I would consider to be white, or refined top
lard< add meat and brown lightly. Chill. Grind up chilled meat and
onions. Turn into a bowl add the toast*NOTE* "Dutch Toast" I think is
like a garlic bread without the garlic, But I'd use stale garlic
bread< add eggs, chopped parsley, salt and pepper and mix well.
Place lamb casing in a greased baking dish, place mixture in casing
and fold over edges. Bake at 350 deg for one hour or until done.
If you wish you may leave out the casing and just make a meatloaf
out of this, topped with rashers of bacon and tomato sauce or salsa.
One variation is to place the meats in a pan with onion, carrot and
parsley and boil until tender. Remove from water, skin tounge and put
meats through a food grinder. Fry onions until transparent and add to
meat mixture, with more parsley, dill, salt and pepper, and eggs. Mix
eggs in well.
Another variation is to take one egg, five tablespoons of flour, a
walnut sized hunk of butter and enough cold water to make a dough,
cut the flour, butter and egg together as for pie dough and roll out
large enough to cover bottom of casserole dish and encase meat
mixture, fold dough over top and prick several times with a fork.
Bake as above.
