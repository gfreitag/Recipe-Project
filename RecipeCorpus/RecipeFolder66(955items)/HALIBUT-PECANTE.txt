Recipe by: Martin Golding <martin@PLAZA.DS.ADP.COM> Heat butter in
frying pan until foaming subsides, reduce heat to medium to medium
low and fry fish five minutes per side, being careful when you turn
not to break it up.

While fish is frying, combine sauce ingredients.

When fish is done, remove to plates or serving platter. Deglaze pan
with th sauce, stirring briskly until it begins to thicken just
slightly. Pour sauc decorously over the fish, and serve.

NOTES:

Other mild, tasty vinegars could be substituted. If all you have is
wine or cider vinegars, use two Tbs of that and two Tbs of some kind
of unsweete fruit pulp or juice.

Since you don't have muscadine wine, substitute a dry
gewurtztrameiner or maybe a riesling- anything dry, with a spicy or
fruity flavor.

Other thick, firm fish ought to do. Fry it five minutes per side per
inch of thickness.

Ride safe, eat dangerously
