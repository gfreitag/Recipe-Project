Title: GUJERATI STYLE CABBAGE
Categories: New import
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Cabbage
3/4 lb Carrots
1/2    To 1 fresh, hot green chile
4 tb Vegetable oil
pn Ground asafetida (optional,
See note)
1 tb Whole black mustard seeds
(see note)
1    Whole, hot dried red chile
About 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2    Teaspoon sugar
4    Heaping tablespoons chopped
Fresh cilantro
1 tb Lemon juice
Core the cabbage and cut it into fine, long shreds. Peel the carrots
and grate them coarsely. Cut the green chile into thin, long strips,
discarding stems and seeds. Set these aside. Heat the oil in a wide,
casserole type pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add asafetida. A
second later, add the mustard seeds. As soon as mustard seeds begin
to pop (this takes just a few seconds), add the dried chile. Stir
once. The chile should turn dark red in seconds. Add cabbage, carrots
and green chile. Reduce heat to medium and stir for half a minute.
Add salt, sugar and cilantro. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes or
until vegetables are just cooked and retain some of their crispness.
Add lemon juice. Stir to mix. Remove and discard whole red chile.
Makes 4 to 6 servings.

NOTE: Asafetida and black mustard seeds are available at import
groceries that sell Indian foods.
