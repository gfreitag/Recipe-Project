Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine all the ingredients in a
5x9 inch loaf pan. Seal the pan snugly with aluminum foil. Bake until
the rice is tender, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

NOTES:

*  A basic steamed rice for gumbo dishes -- If you are making the
gumbo for appetizer servings, make a 1/3 recipe. If you make this
ahead, leave out the bell peppers, since they sour quickly.

*  You can use the rice right away, or leave it in the oven to stay
warm for a couple of hours. If you save it longer than that, reheat
in the top of a double boiler or stir it in a skillet with a little
butter.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 70 minutes cooking.
