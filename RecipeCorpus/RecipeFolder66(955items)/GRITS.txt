Title: GRITS
Categories: Misc, Side dishes
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Grits; white (not instant)
1 tb Salt
Recipe by: Sylvia Woods Preparation Time: 0:30 Heat the water to
boiling in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour in the grits very
gradually, stirring the whole time to prevent lumps. Add the salt,
reduce the heat to low (one or two bubbles should rise to the top at
time), and cook, stirring constantly, until tender, about 10 minutes.
Grits should be as thick as oatmeal, not runny or stiff. If the grits
get too thick toward the end of the cooking time, stir in a little
hot water. Serv hot.
