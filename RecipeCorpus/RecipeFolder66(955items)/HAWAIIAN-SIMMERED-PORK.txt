Title: HAWAIIAN SIMMERED PORK
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
-Hawaii
4 lb Boneless pork loin or butt
3/4 c  White vinegar
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 ts Ground ginger (I like to use
-fresh ginger)
Place pork loin or butt in a 5-quart kettle.  In a bowl, mix together
vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar and ginger. Pour over pork, cover and
simmer approximately 3 hours or until pork is tender when pierced
with a fork. This is one of my old tried and true recipes. The
original recipe card is so faded that I can hardly read it! I like to
serve this with hot rice.
