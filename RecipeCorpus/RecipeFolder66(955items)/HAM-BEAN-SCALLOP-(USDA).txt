Title: HAM-BEAN SCALLOP (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
2 lb Dry navy (pea) beans
2 qt Boiling water
1 tb Salt
1/4 c  Instant minced onions
1 c  Green pepper -- cut in thin
Strips
3/4 c  Butter or margarine
3/4 c  Unsifted flour
4 ts Dry mustard
1 1/2 qt Bean cooking liquid and
Milk
8 oz Processed cheddar cheese --
Shredded (2 cups)
2 1/2 lb Cooked ham -- diced (8
Cups)
TOPPING FOR EACH PAN -----
1/4 c  Fine dry breadcrumbs
1 tb Melted butter
Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

Add beans to boiling water; return to boiling.  Boil beans 2
minutes;then soak beans 1 hour (or overnight, if preferred).

Add salt to beans.  Cook beans slowly until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
Drain; save cooking liquid.  Cook onion and green pepper in fat about
5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in flour and mustard.

Add enough milk to the reserved bean liquid to make 1 1/2 quarts. Add
the bean liquid and milk slowly to the vegetable mixture. Cook until
thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in beans, cheese, and ham. Pour
one-fourth of mixture into each baking pan.  Pack food tightly to
avoid air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 375B0 F. (moderate). Mix
1/4 cup fine breadcrumbs with 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine
for each pan which will not be frozen. Sprinkle topping over bean
mixture in baking pan.  Bake 30 minutes or until crumbs are lightly
browned.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 375B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Mix 1/4 cup fine breadcrumbs
with 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine for each pan. Sprinkle
topping over bean mixture in baking pan. Bake 1 1/2 hours or until
edges are bubbly, crumbs are lightly browned, and center is hot.
