Title: HALIBUT WITH ORANGE
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 oz Plain Flour
4    Halibut Steaks, 4-6oz each
1 oz Butter
1 tb Cooking Oil
6 fl Fresh Orange Juice
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Mix the flour and nutmeg. Dust the fish with it. In a large frying
pan, big enough to take all the steaks, heat the butter and oil.
Saute the steaks gently on both sides for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn up the
heat, add the orange, Lemon juice and worcester sauce and bring to a
rapid boil, spooning sauce all the time over the fish. It will
thicken and glaze in 1 or 2 minutes. The fish will be tender and
succulent. Serve at once with Tagliatelle or new potatoes.
