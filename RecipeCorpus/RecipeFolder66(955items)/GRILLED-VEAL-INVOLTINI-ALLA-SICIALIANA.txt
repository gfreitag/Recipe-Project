8 sl beef, top round, -- about 4

Yield: 4 Servings
:
1 c  grated Pecorino
4 TB bread crumbs
2 bn flat parsley, finely chopped
to yield 1/2 cup

8    3-inch rosemary sprigs,

2 oz olive oil
Lemon wedges

Preheat barbecue or grill.

Using a kitchen mallet or wide cleaver, pound each slice of beef
between 2 oiled pieces of wax paper until thin yet not torn, about
1/16-inch thick. Lay each piece out on a cool working surface. In a
mixing bowl, stir together Pecorino, bread crumbs, parsley, pine nuts
and plumped, drained currants until well blended. Season the beef
slices with salt and pepper. Divide the Pecorino mixture among the 8
pieces of beef, spreading it out thinly. Roll the beef up tightly
like a burrito and secure with toothpicks.

Lay 4 pairs of beef rolls side by side a half inch apart and skewer
them with 2 rosemary sprigs to yield 4 sets. Season with salt and
pepper and brush with olive oil. Grill until cooked, about 3 to 4
minutes per side, and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

Yield: 4 serving
