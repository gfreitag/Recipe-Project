Title: GRILLED SWEET POTATOES WITH BALSAMIC GLAZE
Categories: Vegetables, Side, Dishes
Yield: 8 Servings
8    Sweet potatoes
1 c  Balsamic vinegar
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Butter -- cold
2 tb Olive oil
Scrub sweet potatotes well. Place in a large pot and cover with cold
water. Bring water to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until almost
tender, about 40 minutes (they should be a little undercooked).
Remove from heat and drain; peel and set aside. (Sweet potatoes can
be prepared 1 day in advance up to this point.)

Combine balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan over high heat.
Simmer mixture until it is thick and syrupy, or reduced by one-half,
about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter and cool.

If using grill, heat grill to high. Cut sweet potatoes crosswise into
1/2-inch-thick slices. Brush tops of slices with oil and place,
brushed side down, on grill until marked, about 2 minutes. While
slices are cooking, brush the other sides with remaining oil and turn
over. Grill until marked, about 2 more minutes. Brush grilled sweet
potatoes on both sides with vinegar glaze and serve.

If using broiler, heat broiler to high. Arrange sweet potatoe slices
on a baking sheet and brush tops with glaze; no oil is necessary.
Place baking sheet under broiler and broil until glaze starts to
bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from oven, turn potatoes over, and
brush with glaze. Broil for 3 to 4 more minutes.
