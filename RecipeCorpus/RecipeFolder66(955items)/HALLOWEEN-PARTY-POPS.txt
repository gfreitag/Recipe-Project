Yield: 20 Servings  :
1 pk Refrigerated sliceable
cookie dough
:
20    Wooden sticks
Frosting
:

Cut dough into aobut twenty 1/2 inch slices.  Roll each slice into a
ball. Arrange part of the balls in a circle on ungreased baking
sheets, 3 inches apart and 2 inches from edges. Securely insert a
wooden stick into each ball with end pointing toward center of cookie
sheet. Bake in 350* oven for 10 to 14 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool 2 minutes; remove from baking sheet.  Cool completely on wire
racks. Frost or decorate as desired with ready to spread frosting (or
your favorite homemade). ....this is the oldest trick in the book and
still is at hit (even with teen-agers). Festive and fun!

Decorate the cookies to make pumpkin faces, spider webs and cat
faces. Use assorted seasonal candy for eyes, mouth, whiskers, etc.
