1 lb Prunes
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Nuts
1/2    Orange; pulp, rind-no seeds
1/4 c  Sugar
Cook prunes and remove pits.  Pour boiling water over raisins and let
stand till plump.  Drain.  Put prunes, raisins,nuts, and half orange
in FP.

Zap with steel blade.  Add sugar.  Sara says to put it through the
medium blade of a food chopper or mill.
Anyone have one of these anymore?

Recipe from LOVE AND KNISHES , Sara Kasdan. This one is my personal
favorite filling.  My Bubbe used to chop it up in a large wooden bowl
w/ a hand held single bladed food chopper. She didn't have fancy
gadgets, <G>.
