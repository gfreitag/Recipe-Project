Title: HAWAIIAN JERKY
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Lean meat, thinly sliced
1 ts Salt
1 ts Ground ginger
1 tb Brown sugar
1/4 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
1    Crushed garlic clove
1/4 c  Pineapple juice
1/4 c  Soy sauce
General jerkey method: All recipies use 1 lb lean meat, thinly sliced.
(3/16-1/4 in thick) In a small glass bowl, combine all ingredients
except meat.  Stir to mix well.  Place meat 3-4 layers deep in a
container, spooning sauce mixture over each layer. Cover tightly and
marinate 6-12 hours in the 'fridge, stirring occasionally and keeping
the mixture covered. Layout on trays, 24 to 36 hours in dehydrator. I
used a couple of cans of pineapple chunks with the juice in the
marinated. Just dehydrated them with the meat. Very interesting.
