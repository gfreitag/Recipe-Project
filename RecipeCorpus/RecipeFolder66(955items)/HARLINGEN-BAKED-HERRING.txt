4    Good-sized fresh herring
-(about 1 1/2 pounds),
-cleaned and boned

1 c  Plain yogurt

Adapted from "Seafood", by Alan Davidson (Simon and Schuster, 1989).
According to Davidson, this rich dish of her- ring, eggs and potatoes
serves 4 Dutchmen or 6 others.

Sprinkle the boned herring with half the salt, let stand 5 minutes,
then rinse quickly and soak in cold water to cover for 1 hour.

Melt 2 teaspoons of the butter in a skillet over low heat and cook the
shallots until translucent.

Combine with a third of the yogurt in a bowl.

Drain the fish, cut into bite-size pieces, and add to the bowl with
the shallots and yogurt.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the remaining butter in the
skillet over low heat and stir in the remaining yogurt, egg yolks and
mashed potato.

Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg whites and fold them into the mixture; season with the
sugar and the remaining salt.

Spread half the potato mixture in a buttered baking dish, top with the
herring mixture, and spread the remaining potato mixture on top.

Bake 45 minutes.
