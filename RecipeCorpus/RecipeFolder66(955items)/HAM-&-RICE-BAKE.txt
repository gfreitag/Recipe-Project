2 c  Cooked ham; cubed

-condensed; 10 3/4 oz
3/4 c  Evaporated milk

1 cn Asparagus spears; 14-1/2 oz
1/2 c  Sharp cheddar cheese; grated
Combine ham, rice, onion, soup, milk, salt and pepper, mixing well.
Pour half of mixture into a buttered 1-1/2 quart casserole. Place
asparagus in one layer over mixture. Pour remaining mixture over
asparagus. Sprinkle top with grated cheese. Bake in a preheated oven
at 375 for 30 minutes.

NOTES : I used 1 pound of frozen asparagus just as a personal
preference. Also four of us polished this off with no problems at
all. So if you are planning on serving 6 .I hope they are light
eaters.
