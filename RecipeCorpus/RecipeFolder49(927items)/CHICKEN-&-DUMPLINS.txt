MMMMM-------------------------DUMPLINGS------------------------------
2 c  Bisquick
2/3 c  Milk
Boil chicken. I use some spices to boil in like sage, basil, oregano,
rosemary, garlic, and salt. Any spices you like. De-bone chicken. Add
soup, milk, Lemon Pepper and chicken to chicken broth. Bring to a
boil. Mix milk and Bisquick. (If you have your own dumplin recipe,
use it. I use this one for convenience.) Drop small spoonfulls of mix
into broth mixture. Cover 5 min. Uncover 5 min. VERY HOT! Let cool a
little. I also use more Lemon Pepper than that. It's to taste. I
don't use much salt as the soup has plenty.
