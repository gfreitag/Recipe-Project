Place chicken, onion, bay leaves, spices in a pot and cover with
chicken stock. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer until
the chicken is done. Remove the chicken, let cool and shred. Strain
the broth and save.

Drain, rinse and drain the pinto beans. Place the pinto beans in a
food processor and process until smooth, adding a couple of
tablespoons of either salsa or chicken broth or sour cream if too
thick. In a bowl, combine the chiken and beans, again adding salsa or
the chicken stock until the filling mixture is moist enough to stick
together. (If you get it too wet, add more processed beans. Add the
chopped red onion, the jalepeno pepper, the chopped cilantro and mix.

Take a large flour tortilla and spread with a little bit of the fat
free sour cream and some grated cheese. Add a couple of tablespoons
of the filling on one end and fold the sides over and then roll up.
You can use a toothpick to keep it rolled up or place it end side
down to keep it from unrolling.

Either bake in a hot (450-degree) oven until brown and crunchy or
microwave until hot. Serve toped with lettuce, tomatoes, red onion,
fatfree sour cream, grated cheese, salsa and jalepenos.
