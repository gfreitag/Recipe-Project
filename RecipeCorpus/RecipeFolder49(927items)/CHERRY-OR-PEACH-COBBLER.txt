1/3 c  To 1/2 cup Milk
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Drain cherries or peaches, reserving 1/4 cup juice. Discard the
remaining juice. Combine fruit and lemon juice and set aside. In a
saucepan, combine sugars, cornstarch, cinnamon and nutmeg; stir in
reserved fruit juice. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently about 2
minutes. Remove from heat and add fruit and vanilla. If using
cherries, stir in almond extract instead of the vanilla. Pour into an
ungreased 8 inch square baking pan.

For topping, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt; cut in
butter until crumbly. Stir in enough milk to moisten. Drop by
tablespoonfuls over fruit mixture. Bake at 450 for 10 to 13 minutes
or until golden brown.
