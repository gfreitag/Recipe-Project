This dish looks pretty, layered with the colors.  The first time I
made thi it was good, but it stuck to the pan. The next time I
greased my pan, and did not stick. I also used a 9"x9" pan. It works,
but it is very full and bakes quite tall.  Since they did not specify
size of pan, you could probab use a larger pan. The picture looked
like an oval white pfalzcraft cassero dish.

This is one of the tastiest and handiest recipes we have created in
the kitchen.  The whole dish is prepared, covered, refrigerated
overnight and baked when you are ready the next day. It can be baked
on the same day, but the flavor is not quite as good.
