Title: CHEWY APPLE & OATMEAL COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 13 Cookies
5 oz Wholemeal (wholewheat) flour
5 oz Porridge oats
3 oz Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
5 oz Applesauce
Water to mix
NOTES: 5oz flour = 1 cup
5 oz oats = 1 1/2 cup
3 oz sugar = 1/2 cup
5 oz applesauce = 1/2 cup

Mix the dry ingredients together. Mix in the applesauce, then add
enough water to make a sticky but not too runny batter.

Do this as quickly as possible, then place spoonfuls of the mixture
on a lightly-greased baking tray, flattening into cookie shapes -
they will rise and expand sideways slightly.

Bake at 325 F (Gas 3, 160 C) for about 30 minutes until cooked but not
crisp. NUTRITION per cookie: 107 C, 2.4g protein, 0.8g fat,
