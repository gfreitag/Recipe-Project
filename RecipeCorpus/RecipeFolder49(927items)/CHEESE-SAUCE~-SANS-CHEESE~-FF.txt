Add all ingredients to a blender or food processer and blend until

stirring until barely boiling and sauce is thick and smooth. Serve
imeejetly, if not sooner.
Great on anything on which you'd use a cheese sauce or it's even
good by itself. If you reheat, first add a little water, stir, then
heat. : The original rcp calls for pimientos, but roast peppers give
it a much better flavor. : Modified after Ornish - I think. Jim K
