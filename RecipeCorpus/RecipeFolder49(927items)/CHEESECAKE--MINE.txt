Title: CHEESECAKE- MINE
Categories: Cheesecakes, Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
4 lg Eggs
3 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Cornstarch
2 lb Cream cheese, softened
4 8oz. packages
2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Butter - 1 stick softened
1 pt Sour cream
Fruit topping optional
Beat eggs in large bowl. Blend in sugar, flour and cornstarch. Add
remaining ingredients blending well after each addition. Blend until
smooth. Pour into 9 inch springform pan. Pan will be very full.Bake
for 1 hour at 325F. Turn oven off and leave cake to cool with oven
door open for another hour. Remove and refigerate.

Note: This recipe does not call for a crust. I usually use a basic
graham cracker or chocolate cookie with butter crust. I have used a
10in pan for this cake as well. This is a very tall cake you can use
more or less sugar to your taste. Decorate with fruit, chocolate
whatever you want!
