Yield: 6 Servings
1    (stick of)Butter [melted]
3/4 c  Flour
2 c  Milk [room temp.]
1 1/2 tb Onion powder
1 1/2 tb Garlic powder
1 ts Italian seasoning
1 1/2 ts Mrs. Dash [original]
1 1/2 ts White pepper
1 cn (4oz) Mushrooms [sliced]
(or ¬ c fresh `shrooms)
1/2 c  Parmesan (or Romano) cheese
[Grated]
Pasta for 6 servings
In a med to large bowl make a silk sauce by wisking the flour
1)
into the melted butter adding a little at a time `til the butter
won't take any more flour and you have a thick paste. Wisk in the
room temp. milk `til it is silky smooth and free of lumps... 2) Pour
this into an electric frying pan and simmer on low just to keep warm,
stirring to prevent lumping. (you may add more milk ¬ c at a time to
keep smooth, BUT NOT THIN)... 3) Add the remaining ingredients
(except the pasta) wisking completely after each addition (adjusting
for your personal taste)... 4) Prepare your pasta, (fresh is best if
you can find it or make it), stirring the sauce occasionally... 5)
When the pasta is tender but not over cooked, drain it in a collender
and put it on a warmed serving plate or platter, then carefully pour
the sauce over the top and garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley...
Serve with fresh italian bread or rolls (plain or garlic) and a nice
italian wine...

Variations: a) With meat; Brown 1« lbs. of ground beef and 2 tb of
dried minced onions in a frying pan. Drain off the fat and pour on
top of the pasta before you pour on the sauce... b) With meatballs;
Prepare your favorite meatball recipe and when they are done put them
in the sauce and serve over the pasta... c) All together now; The way
that we like it is; after the pasta is tender but not over cooked,
add the ground beef, stirring to mix well, then add the sauce, again
stirring to mix well...
