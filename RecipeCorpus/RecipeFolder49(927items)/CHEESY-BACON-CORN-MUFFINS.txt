Categories: Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
8 sl Bacon; Diced
1/4 c  Onion; Chopped
1 1/4 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted
1/4 c  Yellow Corn Meal
1/2 c  Sugar
3 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs; Beaten

Fry the bacon and onion in a 10-inch skillet, over medium heat, for 5
minutes or until the bacon is crisp and the onions are tender. Remove
the bacon and onion and drain on paper towels. Sift the flour, corn
meal, sugar, baking powder and salt into a bowl, and set aside. In
another bowl, combine the eggs, milk, and butter, blending well. Add
the egg mixture, all at once, to the flour mixture, stirring just
until moistened. Stir in the bacon-onion mixture, and cheese,
blending well. Spoon the batter into greased 3-inch muffin-pan cups,
filling each 2/3 rds full. Bake in a preheated 400 Degree F. oven for
15 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin
comes out clean. Cool, until cold to the touch, and wrap in foil, or
serve immediately while still hot.

TO REHEAT:

Heat the foil-wrapped muffins in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for
10 to 12 minutes.
