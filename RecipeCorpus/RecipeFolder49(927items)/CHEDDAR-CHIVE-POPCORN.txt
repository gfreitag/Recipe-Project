Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the popcorn in a large bowl.
Put the butter, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic in a small saucepan

softened. Add the chives and stir well. Pour over the popcorn and
toss. Spread the popcorn evenly in a large jelly-roll pan. Bake in

occasionally. Remove the pan from the oven. Toss the cheese with the
popcorn, allow to cool slightly, then serve at once, adding salt to

added to the popcorn. Spread the grated cheese on a plate and chill
it, uncovered, in the refrigerator, for several hours or overnight.
