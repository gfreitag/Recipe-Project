Categories: Desserts, Cheesecakes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  Softened, but still cool
1 c  Sour cream; cold
1 pn Coarse salt; kosher type
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Superfine sugar
1 c  Whipping cream; cold
3 tb Lemon juice; fresh
1.  Chill a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer.
In the bowl, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until soft and
smooth. Gradually add the sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, beating well
after each addition.  Beat in the sour cream and then the whipping
cream. Add the salt, lemon juice and vanilla and beat the mixture
just until thick and smooth. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or
until very cold. Wash and dry the mixer beaters and chill again. 2.
Using the chilled beaters and gradually increasing the mixer speed
from low to medium, beat the cold ice cream mixture until loose and
creamy, about 3 minutes. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serve immediately, or
pack the ice cream into a covered container and freezer for up to 24
hours. (Note: If you do this, use a decorative mold!). Allow the ice
cream to soften in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes before
serving. Makes about 1 quart. Recipe from Food & Wine, December, 1991.
