Recipe by: Midwest Living, December 1995 Run cold water over the wild
rice in a strainer for about 1 minute, lifting the rice to rinse it
thoroughly. In a large saucepan, mix the wild rice, broth and pepper.
Bring to a boil; reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer for 40 to 45
minutes, or until the rice is tender. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook
the mushrooms and shallots in butter until tender, but not brown. Add
the mushroom mixture, chicken and parsley to the soup. Heat through.
