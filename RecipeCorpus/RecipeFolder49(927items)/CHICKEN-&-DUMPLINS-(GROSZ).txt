Title: CHICKEN & DUMPLINS (GROSZ)
Categories: None
Yield: 2 Servings
1    (3 to 4 lb) hen, cooked &
-deboned
(I used 4 thighs for just
-us)
2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening
1/2    To 1 cup COLD water
2 c  Chicken broth
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Butter
Salt & pepper to taste
These are my directions on how to put together: Boil chicken in
seasoned water, I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, some liquid
smoke..just a dribble, and salt and pepper and boiled the chicken
till tender...about an hour. Scoop chicken out and drain, then take
and discard skin...put in freezer to cool while you make dumplins. To
the chicken water, pour in one can or so of evaporated milk...skip
the butter, enough fat from the chicken...let simmer while you make
the dough. put flour and shortening with a dash of baking powder in
large bowl and cut together till crumbly. I used my large whisk since
I've lost my pastry cutter many moons ago...then add just enough cold
water as you need it for a nice soft, non sticky dough. Roll out on
floured surface and roll into thin sheet(s). Cut with sharp knife
into squares. Get your soup boiling and drop the squares in one at a
time...DON'T STIR after adding dumplins..just press. em down a little
and keep adding em in. Let slow boil for about 20 mins.. add the
chicken that you've chopped while the dumplins was cooking...and
EAT!!! Hubby doesn't like garlic, but he sure scarfed these down in
no time!!! You can add veggies now and then..my daughter always liked
this recipe with chopped broccoli..go figure!
