Title: CHICKEN & ASPARAGUS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Chicken Breasts, deboned
-and split
1/2 c  Shredded Part-skim Mozzerela
6    Asparagus Spears, washed and
-sliced into 2-3 inch length
Marinara Sauce (bottled or
-fresh
Rice or Small pasta
Italian Seasonings (Garlic
Plus your favorites)
V small amount of light oil
Toothpicks
Flatten each chicken breast and season to taste. Sprinkle a little of
the mozzerella at one end of each breast. Lay one (or two if they'll
fit side by side) asparagus length on top, cross-wise Roll the breast
up and secure with toothpicks...you should have a bundle of chicken
rolled cylindrically around the spear (e.g. like paper towels on a
cardboard roll). The mozzerella should be at the center ONLY, not
distributed throughout the roll. Repeat for all breasts.

Saute the breast-rolls in a LIGHTLY oiled frypan (as little as you
can get 	away with) until browned. Pour Marinara Sauce over it all
and simmer until the chicken is cooked 	thoroughly. Stir occasionally
to keep from sticking. Serve over Rice or pasta.......WARN your
guests about the toothpicks!

Enjoy!!! Lauretta

I 'invented' this waaay back in grad school. It was the first time I
didn't yelp "Aigh, shouldn't have used so much of, what was that
spice?" I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed trying all the
wonderful recipes posted here.
