Title: CHICHA DE JORA (PERU)
Categories: Beverages, Peru, Holiday
Yield: 4 Quarts
1 lb (4 full cups) Maiz de Jora
-purchased or homemade
2    15-oz cakes chancaca <OR>
1 c  White sugar and
2 c  Brown sugar; packed
+additional for sweetening
8    Whole cloves
1    Dried hot chili pepper
1    Fresh stalk (about 36")
Sugarcane (1-1/2 lbs)
-cut into pieces; crushed
1    Lemon; sliced for garnish
In a stainless-steel stockpot large enough to hold 2-1/2 gallons of
liquid, combine the jora, chancaca or sugars, cloves, pepper, and
crushed sugarcane with 8 quarts of cold water. Allow to soak for 1
hour. Place over high heat and bring to boil, stirring now and then
with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the pot to prevent
sticking and burning. When the mixture comes to a full boil, lower
the heat and gently simmer, covered, for 4-1/2 hours, stirring now
and then.

Remove from heat and allow to rest for about 2 hours undisturbed. Pour
through a strainer.  Press liquid from the sugar cane and discard the
pulp. Strain the mixture again through a double layer of cheesecloth
into a ceramic, porcelain, or glass container and store in a dark,
cool place, covered tightly with cheesecloth or a kitchen towel.
Allow to sit from 3 to 8 days, depending on how strong and how thick
you want the chicha to be. The longer the chicha sits, the higher the
alcohol content and the thicker it will get.

To serve, add the additional sugar to taste, chill thoroughly, and
garnish with lemon slices.
