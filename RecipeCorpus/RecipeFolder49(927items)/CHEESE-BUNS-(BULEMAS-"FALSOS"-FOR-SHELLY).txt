MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 c  Water
1 1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
3 c  Bread flour
2 1/2 ts Yeast
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/3 c  Feta Cheese; grated
1/3 c  Parmesan or Romano Cheese
MMMMM----------------------------MISC---------------------------------
1 oz Vegetable oil; approx
Grate all cheeses. (You may use parmesan or romano cheese or a
mixture of both. Amounts are approximate.) Place some of the
parmesan/romano cheese in a small bowl. Mix the remaining cheeses
together. Make the dough using the "dough" cycle of the Breadmaker.
When done; take the dough out of the pan and squeeze out gasses. Make
12 balls of dough and place temporarily in a baking pan that is lined
with vegetable oil. One at a time, take each ball and spread or roll
(rolling pin is fine) into a six or seven inch circle. Place a
generous strip of the cheese mixture along one side and roll up like
a log. Gently make a coil out of each log. If necessary, seal the end
with a little water. Dip the top in some additional parmesan on an
ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat until all of the balls look like cute
little buns, then bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes or until lightly
browned. This recipe was adapted for the breadmaker from Mom's recipe
for Spinach Bulemas. I leave out the spinach because my husband,
Shelly, HATES spinach! As a part of our Sephardic (Jewish) family
tradition, Bulemas and hard boiled eggs are served before the main
meal on holidays and after returning from synagogue on Saturdays.
