Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Mix the 1 cup of the biscuit baking

into a ball on a floured cloth-covered surface after kneading the
ball 5 times to mix. Roll out the dough until it is 2 inches larger
than an inverted 9-inch pie pan.  Ease into the pan and flute the
edges. Set aside. Cook and stir the meat and onion in a large skillet
until the meat is brown. Drain off the excess fat.  Stir in the salt,
pepper, 2 Tb of the baking mix, and the worcestershire sauce.  Turn
the meat filling into the pastry lined pie pan. Arrange the tomato
slices on the meat mixture. Beat the eggs slightly and stir in the
cheese. Spoon onto the tomatoes spreading the mixture to cover the
top completely.  Bake for about 30 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve
with chili sauce, if desired.
