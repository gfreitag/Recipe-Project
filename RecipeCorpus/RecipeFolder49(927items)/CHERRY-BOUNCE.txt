Title: CHERRY BOUNCE
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 Quart
-Sue Woodward
MMMMM--------------------FOODS OF THE HUDSON-------------------------
5 lb Sweet cherries
1 qt Rum
Brown sugar
Wash and stem cherries.  Crush them between your fingers. Pour the
rum over them and let them stand 1 week. Stir them every day. After 1
week, strain them into a bottle or screwtop jar that has been rinsed
with boiling water. Measure the juice, and add sugar in proportion -
for every gallon (see Sue's note) of juice, add 3/4 lb. brown sugar.
Allow the Bounce to stand 6 weeks before serving.  I keep it in the
refrigerator, it is very nice cold or poured over ice cubes.

Sue's note - as written in the cookbook, it does say "for every
gallon" - perhaps they meant quart?
