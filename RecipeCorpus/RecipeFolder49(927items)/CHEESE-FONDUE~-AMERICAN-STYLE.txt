Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet on low. Slowly add
grated cheddar cheese, Kirsch, and garlic (for best results use
freshly pressed) If mixture looks too thin, add 2 or 3 tb flour to a
small amt. of cold milk, stir until smooth, and slowly add to pot
while stirring. FRENCH BREAD: get the baguettes if available in your
area, if not, any type will have to do. Be sure to heat it in oven at
350 degrees for about 10 minutes, then cut it into bite sized pieces.
It's best when crusty. MEAT DIPPERS: (heat and cut into bite sized
pieces any or all of these). Ham, shrimp, smokie links, cocktail
wieners, smoked sausage, turkey breast, chicken breast, turkey ham,
hot dogs. VEGETABLE DIPPERS : (slightly cooked ...do not overcook, or
else the pieces will slip off the fondue fork and get "lost" in the
pot.... or raw), cut into bite sized pieces Broccoli, cauliflower,
carrots, mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery stalk,
radishes. VARIATION: Instead of cheddar cheese soup use Campbell's
Nacho cheese dip (soup) in cans, and substitute part or all of it for
regular cheddar cheese soup, or add some finely chopped jalapeÂ¤o
peppers to the cheese mixture for extra zest. SPECIAL HINTS: Serve to
company (it's always a hit!) on a cold fall day for lunch, or a
freezing winter's night, or warm their hearts during a gentle spring
rain. Best if served accompanied by champagne or wine. Best mood is
created if candles are lit and a fire is blazing in the fireplace.
Sit fondue pot with fondue in the middle of the table, pot on low
heat. Place dippers in individual bowls. Each guest gets a fondue
fork and first spears a dipper with it, then dips it into the cheese
sauce, twirl it around slowly and balance into mouth. Very addictive,
so be careful. (Renate's own recipe developed and perfected over many
years). Enjoy!
