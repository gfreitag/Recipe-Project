Categories: Pies
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour

3 tb Vegetable shortening
3 tb Ice water; plus

This is a good basic pie crust recipe from Lindsey Shere at Chez
Panisse. It is flaky and has a good butter flavor.

MIX THE FLOUR, SALT AND SUGAR in a bowl. Cut the salted butter in
pieces 1/3-inch thick and quickly cut them into the flour mixture
until it is the texture of cornmeal. You can do this with a pastry
blender, with your hands by rubbing quickly and lightly between your
fingers, or in an electric mixer or food processor. Cut in the
unsalted butter and the vegetable shortening until they are in larger
pieces, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch in diameter. This helps to make the
dough flaky. Sprinkle in the 3 tablespoons ice water, tossing the
dough lightly with a fork to moisten it evenly. Use another teaspoon
of water if necessary to make the dough hold together. Stir the dough
with the fork until it has come together in small lumps and there is
no dry flour left. Divide the dough in half and press it into two
balls. Be careful not to knead it--just squeeze it together. Kneading
activates the gluten, which makes the dough tough. However, if the
dough is crumbly, knead it together very briefly. Wrap tightly in
plastic and chill for at least 4 hours. During this time, the enzymes
in the flour will mellow the gluten to permit the water to be
absorbed completely; this conditioning will help to prevent shrinkage
and toughness later. Makes enough for two 9-inch pie shells.
