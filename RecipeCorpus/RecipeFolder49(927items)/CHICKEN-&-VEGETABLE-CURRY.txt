Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
500 g  Chicken thigh meat
1 lg Boiled potato cut in pieces
2 c  Mixed vegetables
1 lg Onion chopped
2 tb Ghee or vegetable oil
1    Tin coconut cream
1 lg Ripe banana chopped
2 tb Lemon juice
Pinch of sugar
1 tb Cornflour mixed with water
2    Chicken stock cubes
1 tb Chopped ginger
2 tb Good quality curry powder
2 ts Cumin seeds
2 tb Chopped coriander
Cut chicken into bite size pieces and saute with onion and curry
powder in oil until lightly brown.  Add coconut cream, lemon juice,
cornflour, stock cubes. Bring to boil and cook gently for 10 mins.
Blanch raw vegetables in boiling water for a few mins:  drain and add
to the curry together with potato, cumin, ginger and banana. Season
with salt and pepper and serve garnished with coriander. This is not
a traditional Fijian-Indian curry, as the Indians rarely use coconut
cream in their curry.
