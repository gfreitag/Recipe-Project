Title: CHEESE-CRUSTED CHICKEN WITH CREAM
Categories: Cheese
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lb Broiler-Fryer Chicken
1 tb Butter -- melted
5 oz Gruyere Cheese -- shredded
1 tb Dijon Mustard
3/4 c  Whipping Cream
Watercress Sprigs -- for
Garnish
Remove chicken neck and giblets; reserve for other uses. Pull off and
discard lumps of fat.  Rinse chicken inside and out, then pat dry.
Brush skin with butter. Place chicken, breast up, on a rack in a 12-
by 15-inch roasting pan.  Roast, uncovered, in a 375 degree oven
until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh (not
touching bone) registers 185 degrees, or until meat at thighbone is
no longer pink (cut to test), about 1 hour. Using poultry shears or a
knife, cut chicken into quarters. Arrange pieces, skin side up and
slightly apart, in a shallow ovenproof serving dish (use a 9-by
13-inch rectangular or 12- to 15-inch oval dish). Sprinkle with 3/4
cup of the cheese. Return to oven and turn off heat. Skim and discard
fat from pan drippings. Stir in mustard and 3/4 cup of the cream;
bring to a boil over high heat and boil, stirring, until shiny
bubbles form 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat, add remaining
1/2    cup of cheese, and stir until cheese is melted and sauce is
smooth (if necessary, thin sauce with a little more cream). Keep sauce
warm. Broil chicken 4 to 5 inches below heat until cheese is bubbly,
about 1 minute.  Pour sauce around chicken; garnish with watercress.
