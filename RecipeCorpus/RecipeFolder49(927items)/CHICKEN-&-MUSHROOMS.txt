Title: CHICKEN & MUSHROOMS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1    (3-lb) frying chicken
- cut into serving pieces
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 tb Olive or vegetable oil
1 1/2 c  Chopped onions
4 tb All-purpose flour
2 c  Chicken broth
1 lb Mushrooms, sliced
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Wash chicken pieces and pat dry. Season with
salt and pepper. In large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat oil over high
heat and brown chicken pieces, turning when necessary. Adjust heat so
that chicken browns quickly but does not burn. Transfer chicken to
shallow casserole large enough to hold chicken in 1 layer. Add onions
to skillet and cook, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes or until
onions are soft and lightly colored. Stir in flour, mixing well with
spoon. Pour in chicken broth and, stirring constantly, bring to a
boil. Reduce heat and let it simmer 2-to-3 minutes. Pour sauce over
chicken in casserole. Bake, covered tightly, about 20 minutes.
Scatter mushrooms over chicken, re-cover and bake 10 minutes longer
or until chicken is tender. Sprinkle parsley over top and serve.
