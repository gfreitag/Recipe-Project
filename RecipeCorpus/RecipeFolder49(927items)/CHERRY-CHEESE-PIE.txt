bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. FILLING: Beat the two
packages of cream cheese in a bowl using an electric mixer set on
medium speed, until smooth. Gradually add 1/2 cup of sugar and the
vanilla, blending well.  Gently fold the stiffly beaten egg whites
into the cream cheese mixture. Pour into the brown sugar pie crust.
Bake at 325 degrees F. for 25 minutes or until the filling is set.
Cool on a wire rack.  Drain the cherries, reserving 1/2 cup of the
juice. Combine the reserved juice with a few drops of red food
coloring, 1/4 cup of sugar, and the cornstarch in a 2 quart saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils
and thickens. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.  Arrange the
cherries over the cheese filling, then spoon the glaze over the
cherries. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator or
until the glaze is set.  Serve cold.
