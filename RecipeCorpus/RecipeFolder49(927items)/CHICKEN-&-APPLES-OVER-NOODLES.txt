Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Chicken -- cut up
2 tb Corn oil
1 lg Onion -- chopped
1    Garlic clove -- minced
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Apple juice
1 tb Fresh ginger root -- finely
Chopped
1 c  Plain yogurt
1 tb Cornstarch
2    Apples -- cored, chopped
Black pepper -- to taste
8 oz Egg noodles
1. Remove as much skin and fat as you can from the chicken. Cut
chicken into 16 pieces. 2. Heat oil in skillet large enough to hold
chicken pieces in a single layer. Brown chicken on all sides over
medium heat; remove and set aside. Chicken should be done at this
point since it is cut into small pieces. 3. Saute onion and garlic in
same pan until onion is limp and translucent. Add wine, apple juice
and ginger; cook over medium heat until liquid is reduced to 1 cup.
4. Stir cornstarch into yogurt; add to pan with apples and chicken
then season with black pepper. Simmer for about 5 minutes only. 5.
While chicken is cooking, prepare egg noodles according to

instructions on package. Serve over noodles.
