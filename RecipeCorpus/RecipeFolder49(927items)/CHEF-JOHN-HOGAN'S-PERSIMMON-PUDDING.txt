4 tb Butter, melted
1 c  Sugar, plus 2 tb
1 c  Persimmon puree
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground clove
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda

1. Heat an oven to 300 degrees. In a small dish, combine brandy and
raisins.

2. In a bowl, combine melted butter, 1 cup sugar, persimmon pure,
pecans, nutmeg, clove and vanilla. Mix, then add flour, baking soda
and salt and mix again. Add the brandy and raisins.

3. Bring water to a boil in a tea kettle. Using a mixer or hand
beater, whip the egg whites to soft peaks. Continue beating while
gradually adding remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until glossy,
stiff peaks form.

4. Fold this meringue into the persimmon mixture and pour it into a
greased 1-quart souffl mold or six to eight 4-ounce ramekins. Place
the mold in a high-sided pan, place in the oven and fill the pan
half-way with boiling water. Close the oven and bake for 45 minutes,
or until the center of the pudding is springy to the touch.

5. Serve from the mold along with scoops of vanilla ice cream or with
whipped cream.
