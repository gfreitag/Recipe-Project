1    Fryer; cut up
1 c  Mushrooms,  or fresh ones >>
1 pk Lowerys; original style spa
1 c  White wine
COAT BOTTOM OF OVEN proof dish with a cooking spray (Pam), add the
drained canned mushrooms (or fresh ones). Place the chicken on top of
mushrooms and sprinkle the dry spaghetti sauce mix evenly over the
top of the chicken. Then pour wine over the top of chicken>> wetting
down the dry sauce mix. Add wine until you can just see it coming up
around the chicken pieces (about 1 1/2 - 2 cups in a 10" x 10" baking
pan). Loosely cover with foil (you want some steam to escape) and
bake in a 350 oven for about 45 min or until chicken is done. This is
a real simple, quick dish to fix. The sauce and wine make a kind of
gravy so I usually serve it with buttered noodles.
