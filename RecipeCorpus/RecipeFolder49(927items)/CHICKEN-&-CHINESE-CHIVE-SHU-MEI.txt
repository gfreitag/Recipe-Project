Title: CHICKEN & CHINESE CHIVE SHU-MEI
Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Appetizers
Yield: 24 Servings
Filling:
1 lb Ground chicken
1/2 c  Finely chopped Chinese
-garlic chives
1    Clove garlic, crushed
1 tb Dry sherry
1 tb Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Freshly grated ginger
1/2 ts MSG (opt)
1 pn Sugar
1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
1 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground white pepper
Assembly:
Additional whole chives
24    Shu-mei wrappers (Gyoza
-skins)
Mix all filling ingredients together.  Whip by hand until the mixture
holds together very well.  Place about 3/4 T filling in the center of
each wrapper and bring up the corners so that you have a little
"money bag." Leave the top open so that you can see some of the meat.
Blanch the whole chives in very hot tap water just for a moment. Tie
one chive around the neck of each dumpling so that it looks like it
is wearing a little green belt.  Steam in an oiled bamboo steamer for
15 minutes, on high heat. From The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient
Cuisines, Jeff Smith, Avon, c 1989. Typed by Terri St.Louis-Woltmon
