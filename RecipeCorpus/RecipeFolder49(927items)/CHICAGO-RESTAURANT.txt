Chicago Diner 3411 N. Halsted St. (312) 935-6696

it is a REALLY great place for vegan food, and even though I live in
San Francisco now, I still keep their business card posted up at my
desk because I love what it says on the back:

"In one lifetime, the average American eats 11 cows, 1 calf, 3 sheep,
23 pits, 45 turkeys, 1097 chickens and over 1000 fish. Altogether 2180
animals.  Nearly 5 Billion animals are slaughtered each year in the
U.S.A. LOVE ANIMALS DON'T EAT THEM"
