1 1/2 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water (105-115 deg)
1 tb Sugar
3 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal

1/2 c  Warm water
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 cn Tomatoes; 6-1 brand or plum

1 ts Basil
1 ts Oregano

10 oz Mozzarella cheese; sliced
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
1/2 lb Italian sausage; casing rem
Olive oil
Garlic
DOUGH: Dissolve yeast in the 1/2 c. warm water. Add the sugar and stir
well.  Set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 c. of flour,
salt and cornmeal. Make a well in the center of the flour. Add the
yeast mixture, the vegetable oil, and the 1/2 c. of water. Stir and
mix thoroughly until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and a
rough mass is formed. Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a
well-floured work surface. Knead and pound the dough (dust with flour
if dough sticks to hands) for 5-6 minutes, until it is smooth and
soft. Dust the dough and a large mixing bowl lightly with flour.
Place the dough in the bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
a kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 1/2 hrs. After the dough has doubled, turn it out of the bowl
and knead for about 2 minutes. Oil the bottom and sides of the pizza
pan. Spread the dough in the pan with your fingers and palm. (It will
spread more easily if you let it sit in the pan for about 10 min.)
Work the dough until it covers the bottom of the pan. Pull the edges
of the dough up to form a lip or a pronounced border around the pan.
Preheat the oven to 475 deg.  Prick the dough bottom with a fork at
1/2-inch intervals. Let rise for 30 min. Parbake for exactly 4 min.
Brush the crust with olive oil or butter. TOPPING:  In a bowl,
combine the tomatoes, basil, oregano and salt. ASSEMBLY: Lay the
slices of mozzarella cheese evenly over the crust. Spoon the tomatoes
over the cheese. Sprinkly the grated Parmesan cheese over the
tomatoes. Add Italian sausage. Drizzle about 1 T. olive oil on top.
Bake the pizza in a preheated 500 deg. oven on the bottom oven rack
for 5 minutes;  move the pizza to an oven rack 2 levels above the
lower rack and bake an additional 15 minutes, until crust is lightly
browned and sausage is cooked through.  Caroline McCall
