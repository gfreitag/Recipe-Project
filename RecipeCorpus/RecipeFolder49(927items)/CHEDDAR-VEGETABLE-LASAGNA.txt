1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
1/4 c  Margarine, divided
4 c  Shredded carrots
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1/4 c  Flour
2 1/2 c  Milk

1 oz Grated parmesan cheese
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Saute mushrooms in 1 Tbsp margarine until tender; remove from skillet.

Saute carrots and onions in remaining 3 Tbsp margarine 5 minutes or
until carrots are tender.  Reduce heat to medium.

Blend in flour.  Gradually add milk; cook, stirring constantly, until
thickened.  Stir in mushrooms.

For first layer, arrange 3 noodles in bottom of greased 13x9" baking
dish. Top with half the cheddar cheese and half the vegetable mixture.

Cover vegetable mixture with 3 noodles and combined cottage cheese and
spinach.

Repeat first layer.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.

Bake 30 minutes; sprinkle with parsley.  Let stand 10 minutes.

*NOTES: This is a *big* hit with my family!  I always use ricotta
instead of cottage cheese -- works just great.
