Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
2 3/4 c  Milk
1 tb Sugar
1 pk Active dry yeast
5 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 ts Salt
1    Eggs
3 tb Butter
3/4 c  Flour (approx)
1 1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese

2 tb Sesame seeds
1/2 lb Butter

Have egg at room temperature. Heat milk to lukewarm. Soften butter.
Stir the milk and sugar in a large bowl, sprinkle on yeast, let
soften. Beat in 3 1/2 cups flour, cover, let rest 15 minutes. Beat in
the salt and egg, then add the 3 T butter, a little at a time, as you
stir in the remaining whole wheat flour. Turn out and knead on
floured board 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turn, cover, let
rise until double.

Make herb butter with 1/2 lb butter, basil, oregano and a few drops of
lemon juice.

Punch down dough, gradually kneading in the cheese. Divide dough into
fourths.  Roll each into a circle (keep dough not in use covered).
Spread rolled dough with herb butter, cut into wedges, roll up, put
on baking sheet.  Cover loosely.  Repeat with remaining dough. Let
rise until almost doubled.  Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with a few
sesame seeds.

Bake at 375 degrees F, 25 minutes.
