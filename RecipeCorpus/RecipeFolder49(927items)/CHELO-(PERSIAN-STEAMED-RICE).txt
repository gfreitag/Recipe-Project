If you are using Iranian rice, start at least 6 hours ahead. Spread
it on a clean surface and pick out and discard any dark or discolored
grains. Then wash it in a fine sieve or colander set under warm
running water until the draining water runs clear. Finally place the
rice in a large bowl or pot, add 1/4 cup of salt and enough cold
water to cover it by about 1 inch and soak overnight, or for at least
6 hours. If you are using other long-grain rice, wash it in the same
way, but soak it in the salt water for about 2 hours.

In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan equipped with a tightly fitting lid,
bring 6 cups of fresh water to a boil over high heat. Drain the rice
thoroughly and pour it into the boiling water. in a slow, thin stream
so the water does not stop boiling. Stir once or twice, then boil
briskly, uncovered for 5 minutes. Drain in a sieve.

Pour 1 cup fresh water and the melted butter in the saucepan and pour
in the parboiled rice, mounding it slightly in the middle of the pan.
Cover the pan tightly with a strip of aluminum foil and set the lid
in place. Simmer the rice over moderate heat to 15 to 20 minutes, or
until the grains are tender and have absorbed all the liquid in the
pan.

Serve at once. Traditionally, when served with skewered broiled meat
or chicken, the rice is served mounded into individual portions with
a well in the center of each. A pat of butter is placed on top, a raw
egg yolk is dropped in, and the top is sprinkled with salt, a
grindings of pepper and if desired a little dried sumak.
