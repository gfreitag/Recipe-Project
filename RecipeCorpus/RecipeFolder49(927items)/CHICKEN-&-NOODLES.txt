1 pk (10 oz) frozen peas

Cook's Note:  If you like, you can add other cooked vegetables to this
dish.  Blanched sugar snap peas, sauteed mushrooms, or cubes of cooked
butternut squash are delicious.

1. Remove chicken from crockpot with a large slotted spatula or
slotted spoon.  Strain liquid; if time permits, place strained broth
in refrigerator; when fat congeals, remove the fat, discard, and save
the broth.  If making Chicken and Noodles immediately, place strained
broth in fat separator (this is a container that collects the fat and
pours out the lean juices through a spout that's connected at the
bottom); discard fat left in separator.

2. Place juices in saucepan and reduce by one third.  Add carrots and
cook on high heat until carrots are cooked tender-crisp, about 1
minute. Remove from heat and add peas and thyme; set aside.

3. Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions until
cooked al dente.  Drain.  Combine noodles and chicken broth mixture.
Remove chicken from bones and skin, tearing into bite-size pieces;
add to noodles. Add green onions and parsley.  Season with freshly
ground black pepper and salt to taste.

Presentation: If desired, top individual servings with a small amount
of Parmesan grated cheese and garnish with sprigs of fresh Italian
parsley.
