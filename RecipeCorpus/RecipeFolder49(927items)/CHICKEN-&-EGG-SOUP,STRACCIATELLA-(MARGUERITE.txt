This is a very light but satisfying classic soup. It is often called
Stracciatella. Don't worry ifthe soup has a slightly scrambled egg
look, it should do.

Pour most ofthe stock or water into a saucepan, add the chicken stock
cube. Bring the stock or water to the boil. Beat the eggs, blend with
the rest of the cold stock or water, the semolina and cheese. Pour a
little of the boiling liquid over the egg mixture, then return to the
saucepan. Cook over a steady heat for 3 or 4 minutes, do not allow to
boil. Add the parsley and seasoning to taste then serve.
