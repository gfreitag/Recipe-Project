Still got those chestnuts sitting around?  Here's what Ken Hom has to
say about preparing fresh chestnuts or use in Chinese cooking, along
with a recipe for a braised dish in which they can be used. The
recipe doesn't specify how many chestnuts to use so use your own
discretion.

"The Chinese use the same Western chestnut with its sweet flavor and
soft, mealy texture in stir fried dishes and stews like Chinese Beef
Stew and in stuffings.  Shop for large, dark brown chestnuts in the
fall, when they are in season.  Dried chestnuts, once soaked, can be
used like fresh chestnuts.

1. Boil the chestnuts for 30 minutes, shells on.

2. Peel the outer skin first.

3.  Peel the inner skin, revealing the golden meat. Chestnuts are
usually used either whole or split in half.
