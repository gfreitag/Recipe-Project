and saute until warmed. Remove and set aside.  Deglaze pan by
stirring 1 tablespoon vinegar into skillet. Add chicken broth and
simmer, stirring until broth is reduced by 1/2. Add cream, stirring
and reduce liquid again by 1/3. Boil and drain fettuccine and
reserve.  In saucepan, toss with remaining 4 tablespoons butter.

whisking constantly. Sauce must not boil after egg is added - can add
more vinegar to taste. Season as desired. Stir in parsley. Arrange
chicken and artichokes on bed of fettuccine. Serve with green salad.
