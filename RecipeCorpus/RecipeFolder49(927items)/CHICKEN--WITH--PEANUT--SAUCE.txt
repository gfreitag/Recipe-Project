Title: CHICKEN  WITH  PEANUT  SAUCE
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 2 Servings
2 lg Whole chicken breasts(2 lbs)
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Packed brown sugar
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1    Clove garlic, crushed
PEANUT SAUCE:
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
-(optional)
1 tb Vegetable oil
1/3 c  Peanut butter
1/3 c  Water
1 tb Lemon juice
1/4 ts Ground coriander
3    Drops red pepper sauce
1 ds Brown sugar to taste
Preparation : Cut chicken into 3/4 inch pieces. Mix with remaining
ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, stirring
occasionally. This can be broiled at 550 degrees on skewers for 5
minutes each side. I baked chicken pieces in a glass baking dish at
400 degrees for 20 minutes with all the sauce plus 1/2 cup water. I
thicken the juice with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and same amount of
water. Cook and stir onion in oil in 1 1/2 quart saucepan until
tender. Remove from heat. Stir in remaining ingredients; heat over
low heat just until blended (sauce will separate if over cooked).
Serve on the side as a dip.
