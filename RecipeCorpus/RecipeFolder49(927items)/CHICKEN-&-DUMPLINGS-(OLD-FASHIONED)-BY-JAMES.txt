Follow the recipe for poached chicken in Double Chicken Broth.
:
See: Double Chicken Broth Stock recipe. In this recipe you leave
the chicken in the pot and add the dumplings, as described below,
then serve the chicken and dumplings. * Directions for Dumplings *
While the chicken is cooking in the other recipe, make up the
dumplings, which will be added for the last 15 minutes of cooking
time. Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the eggs and milk
together lightly and blend with the flour mixture to make a fairly
stiff dough. Form very small dumplings by taking a tablespoon full of
dough and rolling it into a ball shape. You may use the palm of your
hand to do this. About 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time,
remove the lid from the pot in which the chicken is cooking and drop
the rounded tablespoons of the dumpling dough over the surface of the
liquid, spacing them a few inches apart as the dumplings puff up.
Cover the pan, keeping the liquid at a simmer, and cook the dumplings
for 15 minutes, until light and cooked through. Do not remove lid
while dumplings are cooking. Serve with the poached chicken.
