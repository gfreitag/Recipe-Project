Here is a new twist on the old standby....something different,but
truly delicious! Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add
chicken and onion; saute 2 to 3 minutes until chicken turns white.
Add broccoli and broth; simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked
through, 5 minutes. Transfer chicken and broccoli to bowl using
slotted spoon; set aside and cover to keep warm. Cook down pan juices
until 1/4 cup remains. In food processor or blender, process rickety
with mustard until smooth. Add pan juices, season to taste with salt
and pepper and stir in tarragon and chives. Process until well mixed.
Divide sauce between 4 plates. Spoon chicken over sauce and sprinkle
with herbs. Serve with rice or pasta.
