Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet, add onions, garlic, peppers,
paprika and diced pecans. Cook over medium heat until onions are
clear. Add Tabasco sauce.

Turn heat to high, add sliced pecans and fish pieces cut about 1 inch
thick. Cook on high 4-5 minutes per side. Smear uncooked side with
sauce before turning. Add lemon juice and oregano after turning.

NOTES:

*  Fish in a hot garlic/pecan sauce -- The Cajun Cafe in Portland
Oregon serves a sauce whose recipe they got under license from
K-Paul's in New Orleans.  They devoutly refused to answer all of my
questions about the sauce or its ingredients, so I've tried to
formulate it on my own, at home. This stuff doesn't taste exactly
like what the restaurant serves, but it's delicious in its own right.
Maybe it's best to title the recipe "fish with something not entirely
unlike hot fanny sauce."

This sauce is best served with a moderately strong fish:  I would
recommend sturgeon, swordfish, or tuna.

*  If you are cooking more pieces of fish than will fit in the
skillet at once, make the sauce ahead, put it aside (keep warm) and
add it before cooking each piece of fish.

*  Serve with a simple rice or pasta dish.  I use saffron rice with
snow peas, or linguine with shrimp meat and pesto.
