MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
4 qt Water
1    Beef roast - 2 pounds
2 lg Onions
1    Horseradish root
Salt to taste
Crusty French bread
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Brown roast in large heavy stock pot. Brown chopped onion after the
roast. Cover roast and onions with 4 quarts of water. Boil until
roast is tender. Take off heat and cool long enough so that you can
shred the meat by hand.

Return the shredded meat to the stock pot and season soup to taste.
Slice bread on diagonal and float on stock. Take cleaned fresh
horseradish and grate it into the soup. Taste occasionally until you
have got it as you want it (at least 1/4 C of grated horseradish).

Stand back while you are grating soup into boiling stock. The fumes
will make your eyes burn and water and your sinuses will instantly
clear. Submitted By JOYCE MONSCHEIN   On   07-02-95
