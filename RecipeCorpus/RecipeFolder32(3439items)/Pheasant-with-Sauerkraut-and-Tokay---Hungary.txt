Clean and wipe pheasants with a cloth soaked in brandy. Let the
pheasants stand for thirty minutes at room temperature then rub the
birds inside and out with the salt, pepper and paprika. Put crab
apples, onions, parsley, celery, green pepper, chervil and garlic
inside and sew up the opening.

Cover the breast with the sheets of fat pork and brush with the
anchovy butter. Truss and roast the birds in a moderate 350 oven for
twenty five minutes or until brown on all sides.

Have ready the sauerkraut which has been marinated overnight in the
Tokay, juniper berries, cloves, caraway seeds, onion slices, carrots,
raisins and peppercorns.

Cook the sauerkraut and bacon for about thirty five minutes. Arrange
the pheasants on the sauerkraut, cover and bake in the oven thirty
five more minutes or until tender. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Arrange the sauerkraut on a large heated platter, carve the birds,
reshape and nest them on the sauerkraut. Serve with a chilled mixture
of red current and guava jellies.
