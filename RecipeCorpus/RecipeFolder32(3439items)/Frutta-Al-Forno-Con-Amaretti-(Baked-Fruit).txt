Categories: Italian, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
4    Peaches; freestone -- ripe
1 tb Amaretto liqueur
1 tb Butter
1    Egg yolk
1/4 c  Brown sugar -- packed
8    Italian macaroons
(Amaretti)
1/4 c  Almonds -- finely chopped

Cut peaches in half from stem to root end (don't peel). Twist to free
from pit.  Place peach halves, cut side up, in a 10" well-buttered
baking dish. Combine remaining ingredients.  Beat with a fork to
blend well. Stuff each peach hollow with almond mixture. Bake in
preheated 350 oven for 20 minutes, or until peaches are soft but
still hold their shape. Serve warm. This can also be done with pears,
apricots, nectarines or apples. All are very good.
