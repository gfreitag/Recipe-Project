Title: Galab Jamuns (Northern India)
Categories: Breads, Indian, Side dish
Yield: 12 servings
4 c  Sugar
4 c  ;Water
3    Cardamom pods
2 c  Nonfat dry milk
1 c  Biscuit mix
1/2 c  Liquid milk
2 tb Melted butter or margarine
Vegetable oil for frying
Combine sugar and water in a pan and stir to dissolve.  Crush
cardamom and add it to the syrup.  Bring to a boil, cook 15 to 20
minutes or until mixture is syrupy, then remove from heat.  Remove
about a quarter of the syrup to another smaller pan and keep that at
a simmer.

Meanwhile, combine dry milk, biscuit mix, milk and melted butter.
Grease hands and palms and shape the milk mixture into balls less
than 1" in diameter.  Heat about 3" of vegetable oil in a pan.  Add 1
ball - it shouldn't crackle, but should make small bubbles in the
oil. If the heat is right, cook remaining balls in the oil, a few at
a time. Cook 6 to 8 minutes, or until light brown (they will expand).
Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon.

Place the fried balls in the syrup that you've set aside in the
smaller pan.  Bring to a boil, then remove the balls and put in the
large pot of syrup.  Keep adding fried balls to small pan, then
transfer to large pan of syrup.  Discard the syrup left in the small
pan. Discard cardamom pods before serving.

Serve chilled or at room temperature. Serve in a small bowl with the
syrup.

Yield: About 24, or 12 servings.
