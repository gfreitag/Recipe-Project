MMMMM-----------------COMBINE AND MIX THOROUGHLY----------------------
2/3 c  Mayonnaise
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb Honey
2 tb Half and half
1 tb Prepared mustard
1 1/2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/8 ts Dry mustard
1 tb Parsley; chopped
MMMMM----------------OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS TO ADD---------------------
1/8 ts Curry
1    Green onion; chopped
1/2 ts Celery seeds

NOTE: You can garnish the greens to reflect your own intentions by
combining common ingredients in an unusual way. A creative
arrangement of olives and carrots could be mildly fliratious--or
boldly suggestive, depending on how you slice them! Compose your
salad to best express your desires, but keep it simple and make your
own dressing, if possible. This recipe is a basic honey-lemon
dressing whose variety is almost endless. Source: Cooking In The
