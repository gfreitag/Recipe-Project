Title: Mediterran Tomato Soup with Pasta
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables, Vegetarian, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Olive Oil
1 lg Onion, minced
2 1/2 lb Ripe tomatoes, cut in large
Dice
4 lg Garlic cloves, chopped
2 c  Chicken stock or any broth
1 1/4 c  Water
1 1/4 ts Dried leaf oregano crumbled
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
1 c  Small pasta, such as thimble
Shaped ditali (salad
Macaroni)
2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh basil
Bowl of freshly grated
Parmesan cheese (for serving
If desired)
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add onion
and cook, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes or until soft but
not brown. Add tomatoes, garlic, stock, water, oregano, salt, and
pepper; bring to a boil.  Cover and cook over low heat 45 minutes.

Puree soup in a food mill; or puree in a food processor and strain,
pressing so pulp goes through strainer.  (Soup can be kept, covered,
2 days in a refrigerator.)  Return soup to saucepan and reheat.  If
soup appears thin, simmer uncovered 2-3 minutes to thicken slightly.

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and add salt.  Just before
serving add pasta and cook uncovered over high heat, stirring
occasionally, 5-8 minutes or until tender but firm to the bite.
Drain well. Add to soup.

Stir in 1 tablespoon basil.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  Sprinkle
with remaining 1 tablespoon basil.  Serve with parmesan cheese, if
desired.

NOTE: Made this only when you have very ripe tomatoes - they are the
soul of this soup while the ditali, or pasta thimbles, give it body.
The soup is relatively easy to prepare because there is no need to
peel or seed the tomatoes.   After cooking, they are pureed in either
a food mill or food processor.  A garnish of tomato slices nad basil
sprigs looks very attractive.

This recipe came from a friends pasta cookbook.  It is great!!!
