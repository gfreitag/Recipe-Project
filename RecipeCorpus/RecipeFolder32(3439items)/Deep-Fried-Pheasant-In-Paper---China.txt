Put two, sixteen inch squares of parchment paper or heavy cellophane
next to each other with one point facing you. Put half the pheasant a
little below the center of each square and fold the point of the
paper up from the bottom and in from both sides to cover the
pheasant. Fold the top down and secure in the split created by the
previous folds. In a large skillet, bring four cups of oil and fry
for ten minutes. Remove the packets and serve immediately. Slit the
paper and serve pheasant from the paper.
