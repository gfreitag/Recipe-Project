Recipe from Kimberly's Cafe, Wilton Manors, FL

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously grease and flour 2 (9-inch)
round (1-1/2 inch deep) cake pans.

Drain peaches, reserving the syrup.  Add enough water to the syrup to
measure 1-1/4 cups liquid.

Prepare the cake mix according to package directions, substituting the
peach syrup mixture for the water.

Divide the batter as evenly as possible between the two prepared
pans. Bake for 24 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center
comes out clean. Place pans on wire racks and cool cakes in pans for
10 minutes. Invert the pans onto the wire racks and cool cake layers
completely.

Meanwhile, cut the peach slices crosswise into 3/8-inch pieces.  Dry
well on paper towels.  Mix the whipped topping thoroughly with the
yogurt and fold in the peaches.

Place one cake layer, top side down, on a serving plate.  Cover with
about half the whipped topping mixture.  Top with the other cake
layer, top side up, and spoon remaining topping mixture over the
cake. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or until completely chilled.
