Fry the salt pork until crisp in a Dutch oven or heavy iron pot.
Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Mix the flour with the pepper in a paper bag. Add the fresh beef
cubes and shake to coat them before quickly browning in the pork fat,
adding more fat or oil if needed. Remove beef as it is browned and
add to the reserved salt pork cubes. Lightly brown the onions in the
same fat.
Return beef cubes and pork to the pot, cover with broth, and simmer
until beef is barely tender, about 30 minutes.  Add potatoes and
corned beef and simmer 30 to 45 minutes more. Halfway through, taste
for seasoning and, if salt is needed, add anchovies. For a heftier
taste, add Worcestershire sauce.
