These polpette are glorified meatballs that have that typically
Italian flavor given by a mixture of lemon peel, garlic, and parsley
that is known as gremolada.  This is a recipe from Lombardy.

Mince finely together the zest of 1 small lemon, 2 teaspoons parsley,
and 2 cloves of garlic.  Add to this the ground beef, together with
the salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Stir in the crumbled white bread that
has been soaked in milk and squeezed dry.  Finally, stir in 1 beaten
egg. On a floured board, form the mixture lightly into small
flattened cakes about 1/2 inch thick and 1 1/2 inches wide.  Do not
work the mixture or press it too much. Brown the cakes in 1/4 cup hot
olive oil for about 2 minutes on each side. Drain them and serve at
once.
