Title: Steamed Rice Coconut Milk Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Rice flour
3 c  Granulated sugar
3 c  Coconut milk
1 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Active dry yeast
1 ts Water
1    Wine rice ball, crushed to a
-powder
Combine 3 tablespoons of the rice flour, 1/4 cup of the coconut milk,
and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast with the wine rice ball.  Cover and allow
to stand at room temperature for three hours.

Cook 2 1/2 cups of the coconut milk with the sugar just long enough
to melt the sugar.  Remove from the heat and cool.

After the yeast-rice flour mixture has rested for three hours,
combine it with the coconut milk-sugar mixture.  Mix well, cover, and
allow to rest at room temperature for another 3 hours.  At the end of
the resting time, combine the mixture with the remaining coconut
milk, lemon juice, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, which
should first be dissolved in the teaspoon of water.  Transfer to
several small bowls or pans so that the mixture fills it only halfway
to allow room for expansion. Let stand overnight, at room
temperature. The following day, steam [using the wet steaming method
as described on page 36] for 30 minutes.

Serve the cake either hot, cold, or at room temperature.

Note: A wine rice ball can be purchased in Oriental grocery stores.
They are about the size of a camphor ball, and white.  To crush, use
a rolling pin or a blender.

Steaming

A steamer consists of a pot in which water is boiled and at least two
more metal inserts or layers that fit directly on the lower pot of
water, one above the other.  These inserts are perforated, allowing
wet steam to circulate freely through the layers and enabling either
a large quantity of one food or several different foods to be cooked
at the same time.
