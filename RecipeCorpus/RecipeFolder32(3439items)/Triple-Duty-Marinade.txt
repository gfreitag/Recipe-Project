Title: Triple-Duty Marinade
Categories: Meats, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Garlic clove, chopped
6 tb Dry white wine
2 tb Raspberry vinegar
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 tb Green peppercorn mustard
-or Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Canola oil; or other
-flavorless vegetable oil
This recipe makes enough marinade for 2 large flank steaks, at least
1 1/2 pounds each.

Score one steak on both sides.  Put it in a shallow glass or ceramic
dish. (Wrap and refrigerate the other steak for the next two meals.)
Sprinkle the steak with garlic.  Whisk in the oil.  Pour the marinade
over the steak, turning to coat.  Marinate at least 6 hours, covered
and refrigerated.  When the meat is ready for cooking, reuse the
marinade with halved portions of the second steak.

NOTE:  You may substitute a simpler marinade made by whisking together
canola oil and red wine vinegar in 3-to-1 proportions.  Sprinkle the
meat with chopped garlic, then pour the whisked mixture over it.
