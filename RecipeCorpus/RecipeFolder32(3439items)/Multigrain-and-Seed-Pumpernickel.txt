"Bread Machines" article by Beatrice Ojakangas; author of Great
Holiday Baking Book and the forthcoming Light Muffins (Clarkson N.
Potter).

This is for those who love a chewy, grainy, close and even textured
bread, even though it turns out with an irregular and "funny" top. It
is a recipe that I adapted from Jane Brody's Good Food Gourmet.
Gluten is optional but will improve the texture of the bread. You can
find it at most whole foods or natural foods stores.

Combine the water, wheat and millet in the bread pan. Let stand for 30
minutes until the mixture has cooled to lukewarm. Add the remaining
ingredients in order, ending with the dry yeast on top. For machines
that reverse the order, combine the water, wheat and millet in a bowl
and let cool for 30 minutes. Measure remaining ingredients in reverse
order into the bread pan and pour the wheat mixture over the top.

Program the machine to wheat bread, or basic bread. Press start.

In about 1-1/2 hours, your bread machine will produce this dough all
ready for shaping, rising and baking. The original recipe produced
three loaves. I have successfully made this dough in the small as
well as the larger bread machine baking pans. To produce a baked
loaf, use a machine with a pan capacity of at least 12 cups and
reduce the amount of yeast to 1-1/2 teaspoonful.
