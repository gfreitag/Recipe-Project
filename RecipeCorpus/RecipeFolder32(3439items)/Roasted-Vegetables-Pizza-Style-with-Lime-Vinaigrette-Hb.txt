Prepare vegetables: Place eggplant and zucchini in a colander and
sprinkle liberally with salt. Allow to drain for 30 minutes.

Pat the eggplant and zucchini dry. Brush the eggplant slices lightly
with some of the oil. Set aside.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 3 T  of the oil. Add
the onions and peppers and saute until soft. Add the garlic and cook
for 1 minute. Set aside.

Liberally brush the bottom of a 14-inch-diameter pizza pan with oil.
Arrange the egg-plant slices in an overlapping pattern to cover the
bottom. Arrange the zucchini in the same way on top of the eggplant.
Sprinkle with the onion-and-pepper mixture, then the tomatoes.
Sprinkle evenly with the stock, herbs, and any remaining oil. Season
with salt and pepper to taste. Bake in a preheated 350'F oven until
the eggplant is tender, about 50 to 60 minutes.

Prepare vinaigrette: Combine all ingredients and whisk well.

Remove vegetables from oven, let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
Slice into wedges like a pizza and serve with lime vinaigrette.
Serves 8 to 10.
