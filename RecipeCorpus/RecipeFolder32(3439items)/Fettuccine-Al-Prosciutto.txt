Categories: Pasta, Guestchefs
Yield: 4 servings
6 oz Prosciutto
4 oz Butter
2 tb Minced onion
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 lb Fresh fettuccine
2/3 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
SEPARATE FAT AND LEAN parts of prosciutto. Chop fat coarsely; cut
lean into 1/2-inch squares. (If prosciutto has little or no fat,
simply increase butter by 1 to 2 tablespoons.) Melt butter in a
skillet. Add onion and prosciutto fat and saute 5 minutes. A Drain in
a colander but not too thoroughly: leave them a little moist.

pepper, and toss again. Strew reserved prosciutto on top and serve at
once.
