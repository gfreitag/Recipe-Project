This recipe is said to have been a favorite of President and Mrs.
Kennedy as prepared by Renee Verdon, White House chef during the
Kennedy Administration.

Roast the pheasants for about thirty minutes at 350; baste every ten
minutes with melted butter. Remove the pheasants and keep warm. Pour
drippings from the toasting pan into a skillet, add the cognac or
brandy and flame it. Combine a small amount of sherry, some brown
sauce and heavy cream and bring to a boiling point.

Place the pheasants in an oven-proof terrine, spread with the foie
gras, sprinkle with truffles and pour the gravy on top. Cover and
bake in a preheated 300 oven for ten minutes.
