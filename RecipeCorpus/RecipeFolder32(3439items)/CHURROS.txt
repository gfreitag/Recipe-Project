"Here's a recipe from a local Mexican resturant, called Listas, that
I use to frequent." - Anne Nicol

Sift together the flour and cinnamon.  Heat oil (1 inch in depth) in
large heavy skillet to medium-high(375 degree). In a medium heavy
saucepan, bring water to a boil over high heat; add butter and salt,
allowing butter to melt.  Remove from heat.  Add dry ingredients;
mixing well with whisk. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking well.
Spoon into a pastry or piping bag, fitted with star shaped tip.
Squeeze batter in a straight line into hot oil, making each churro
about 6 inches in length.  Fry until churros are golden brown, about
3 minutes, turning occasionally.  Drain well on paper towels and sift
confectioners' sugar over churros.  Serve warm.
