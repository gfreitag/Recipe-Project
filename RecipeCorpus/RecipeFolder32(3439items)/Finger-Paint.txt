Title: Finger Paint
Categories: Kids
Yield: 3 cups
1    Envelope Unflavored Gelatin
1 c  Water, cold, divided
1/2 c  Liquid Laundry Starch
2 c  Water, hot
1/2 c  Soap Flakes
Food Coloring
Dissolve gelatin in 1/4 cup of cold water, set aside.

Combine laundry starch and remaining cold water in a saucepan.  Add
the hot water and cook over medium heat, strirring constantly (use a
non-metal spoon), until mixture reaches a full boil and thickens
completely.

Remove from heat, blend in dissolved gelatin.  Stir in soap until
completely dissolved.

Transfer mixture to covered containers, dividing as desired.  Add food
coloring to mixture in each container.  Use only small amounts of food
coloring, as too much additional liquid will make the paint runny.

Store in covered containers.

VARIATON:  Substitute 1 small package of sugar-free gelatin (any
flavor) for the unflavored gelatin and omit food coloring.
