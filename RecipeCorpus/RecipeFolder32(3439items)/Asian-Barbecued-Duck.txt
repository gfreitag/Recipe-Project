Combine the remaining ingredients in a food processor. Puree. Place
the duck pieces in a flat glass baking dish, Pour the marinade over.

Let the duck pieces marinate for 1 hour, turning once during that
time. Prepare the barbecue - it is NOT ready until ALL the coals have
a THICK, even coating of gray ash.

Place a drip pan in the center of the barbecue with the hot coals
surrounding it. Place the duck pieces on the grid directly over the
drip pan. Place the lid on the barbecue. Cook until the skin is brown
and the duck is done to taste. Serve hot.
