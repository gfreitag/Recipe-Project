Rub pheasant cavity with one tablespoon of the soft butter, salt and
pepper literally, then truss bird securely.

In a heavy skillet or large dutch oven, heat three tablespoons of
butter over a low fire, add pheasant and brown on both sides. When
the pheasant is browned, transfer to a plate. Add a half cup of
chopped onions and cook until golden brown, then add the wine and
bring to a boil. Stir in the water, bay leaf, salt and pepper to
taste. Return the pheasant to the casserole, drape the bacon across
the breast, cover and simmer for forty five minutes. Remove the bird
to a warm platter, cover with foil, while you make the sauce.

SAUCE

In a skillet, melt the remaining butter over high heat, do not burn.
When the foam subsides add the mushrooms and cook for three minutes,
stirring occasionally. Add the flour and stir for about one minute,
gradually add the cream until sauce thickens. Taste for seasoning.
Carve the pheasant into serving pieces, pour the sauce on top and
serve at once.
