1. Egg Sfoglia - On clean surface, place flour in a mound and make a
well in center. Add eggs, oil and salt in center. Beginning with the
flour in the center of the well, incorporate with the egg mixture
using your fingers or a fork so the wall of flour prevents the egg
from spilling onto the work surface. Gradually knead in all the flour
necessary to make a smooth firm dough. Spinach Sfoglia: Follow above
procedure putting the minced spinach in the center along with the
other ingredients.

2. On a clean work surface or using a pasta machine, roll-out egg
dough to an 8 x 24 rectangle with a 1/16th-inch thickness. Cut dough
into twelve 4-inch squares. Select 6 parsley leaves, rinse, pat dry
and place on a clean work surface. Roll the pin over each leaf,
pressing OUt any excess juice. Pat parsley dry again. Place one leaf
in the center of each of the 6 squares. Place the other 6 squares on
tOp. Roll out each square to less than 1/16th inch and trim edges to
make a neat square. Roll out spinach dough to an 8 x 12 rectangle and
less than 1/16th-inch thickness. Cut into six 4-inch squares. Place
pasta squares on a drying or cooling rack up to 1 hour or until
surface is a little dry to the touch.

3. Ripieno (Stuffing): In a medium casserole or saute pan over medium
heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter and saute the scallops until the
surface is opaque white, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup fish stock,
simmer for 1 minute, add 1/8th cup wine and simmer for 1 minute. Pour
scallops into a colander to drain off the cooking liquid. In the same
casserole or pan, melt 1/2 tablespoon butter over medium heat and add
the remaining 3/4 cup fish stock. Reduce by half, about 2 to 3
minutes. Transfer the scallops back into the pan and add 1/2 teaspoon
ginger juice. Simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Cool for 1
minute, then whisk in the remaining 1-1/2 tablespoons cold butter to
thicken sauce. Season to taste.

4. Meanwhile, in a deep pot of boiling water, add salt, then the pasta
squares and boil until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes (watch them
carefully). Immediately drain.

5. Assemble: On warmed serving plates, place one spinach pasta square
in the center of each plate. Using a slotted spoon, arrange the
scallops on top of each spinach square and spoon 1 tablespoon of the
sauce over them. Then place one egg-with-parsley pasta square at a
90-degree angle on top of the scallops and spoon 1 tablespoon of the
sauce over. Serve immediately. Consult photograph on preceding page
for final presentation. Notes:A mixture of scallops, shrimp and white
fish filet such as red snapper or bass may be substituted for the sea
scallops. Store-bought, sheet pasta may be substituted for the
homemade.
