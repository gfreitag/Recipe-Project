Soften yeast in water. Combine flour, sugar, nutmeg, salt and lemon
rind in a large bowl. Make a well in center. Add yeast mixture, milk,
eggs, egg yolks and combine completely. Beat in butter until dough
forms a ball. Place on floured board; incorporate more flour if
necessary. Knead until smooth and elastic. Stir dough in well
buttered bowl and turn so all surfaces are buttered. Cover with a
towel and let rise 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk. Brush baking
sheet in butter. Punch down on lightly floured board. Knead, then pat
into a 14" cylinder. Place on baking sheet and form into a large
ring. Press trinket into dough so that it is hidden. Set aside,
covered with a towel, to rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Before baking, brush
top with the egg milk mixture. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven
for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack. Beat
icing ingredients until smooth. Spread over top of cake, letting drip
down sides. Immediately sprinkle sugars over icing in 2" wide strips
of purple, green and yellow stripes. *Colored sugar is sold in baking
supply houses. If you can't find it, tint icing with food coloring.
