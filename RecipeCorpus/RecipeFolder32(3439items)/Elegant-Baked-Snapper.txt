Place fillets in a baking dish and sprinkle with dill weed. Mix the
sour cream, seafood seasoning, and pepper together and use a rubber
scraper to "frost" the mixture over the fillets. Sprinkle with the
chopped onion and the grated cheddar cheese. Bake at 400o F until
lightly browned and the fish flakes easily with a fork when tested in
the center. Serves 6.

Microwave version: Prepare as above, cover and cook in the microwave
on high for 8 minutes. Test and continue to cook until the fish
flakes easily. Brown in the oven (lightly). Alaska Seafood Cookbook
