"The traditional cookie for Purim, hamantashen is Yiddish for "Haman's
pockets".  They are meant to recall the story of Haman, a wicked
Persian prince who wished to destroy the Jews but was foiled by
Mordecai and Esther."

To make filling: In a small saucepan, combine prunes, raisins and l/2
c. water.  Simmer over low heat until the prunes are tender but still
firm and liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.

In a food processor, combine the prune mixture, apples, walnuts,
sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest; process until smooth.  Transfer to
a small bowl and set aside. (The filling can be made up to 2 days
ahead and kept, covered, in the refrigerator.)

To make cookies: In a medium-sized bowl, using an electric mixer on
medium speed, cream sugar, oil and butter until smooth.  Add egg and
beat until smooth.  Add vanilla and beat until blended.

In another medium-sized bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and
salt. Using a wooden spoon, stir the dry ingredients into the sugar
mixture until just combined.  Gather the dough together into a ball,
wrap with plastic wrap, and flatten slightly.  Refrigerate for 2 to 3
hours or overnight.

Line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment or coat with non-stick
cooking spray. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Divide the dough in half. (Refrigerate the other half.)  Roll out on a
lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/2" inch.  Using a 2 1/2"
diameter cookie cutter, cut the dough into circles.  Place l/2 tsp.
of the filling in the center of each circle.  Bring the edges
together to cover the filling, forming a 3-cornered cookie.  Pinch
the corners together to seal.  Place about 1 1/2" apart on the
prepared baking sheets.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the tops are golden.  Transfer to
racks to cool.  Repeat with the remaining dough. (Store cookies in an
airtight container for up to 3 days.  Freeze for longer storage.)
