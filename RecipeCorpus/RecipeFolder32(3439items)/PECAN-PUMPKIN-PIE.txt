Prepare pie shell.  Keep chilled.

In another bowl, combine corn syrup, about 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3
eggs, about 3 T butter, vanilla, lemon rind, lemon juice and salt.
Stir in pecans.

Spread the pumpkin layer into the pie shell, then carefully spoon the
pecan mixture over it.  Bake in the upper third of a preheated 425
degree F. oven for 20 minutes, then reduce to 350 degrees F. for

temperature.  Reheat in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 10 to 15
minutes.
