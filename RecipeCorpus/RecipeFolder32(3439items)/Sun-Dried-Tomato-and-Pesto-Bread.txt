Holiday Baking Book and the forthcoming Light Muffins (Clarkson N.
Potter).

This bread has a wonderful flavor with the aroma of basil and a bite
of pepper. It's perfect with an antipasto smorgasbord, chilled or hot
soup, or a pasta salad. To reconstitute sun dried tomatoes simply
soak them in warm water for 10 minutes.

Measure the ingredients into the container of the bread machine in the
order given. (Reverse the order in machines which call for adding the
liquids last of all.)

Program the machine for the basic or regular cycle and press start.
