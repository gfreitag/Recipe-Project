Title: Knishes  - Dough
Categories: Jewish, Pastry
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 c  Flour -- sifted
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
2/3 c  Salad oil
2    Tablspoons
Water
Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl.  Make a well in
the center and drop the eggs, oil and water into it.  Work into the
flour mixture with the hand and knead until smooth.    There are two
ways to fill the knishes.  In either case, divide the dough in two
and roll as thin as possible.  Brush with oil. Now you can spread the
filling (the recipes for four fillings are included in this database)
on one side of the dough and roll it up like a jelly roll. Cut into 1
1/2-inch slices. Place on an oiled baking sheet cut side down. Press
down lightly to flatten. Or you can cut the rolled dough in 3-inch
circles.  Place a tablespoon of the filling on each; draw the edges
together and pinch firmly. Place on an oiled baking sheet, pinched
edges up.    In either case, bake in a 375 degree oven 35 minutes or
until browned.  Makes about 24.    Recipe Source: THE ART OF JEWISH
