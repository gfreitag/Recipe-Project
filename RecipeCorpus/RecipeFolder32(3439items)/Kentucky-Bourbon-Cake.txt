Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts, Alcohol
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 lb (3 sticks) butter
2 c  White sugar
2 1/4 c  Light brown sugar, firmly
-packed
6    Eggs
5 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Mace
2 c  Bourbon whiskey (alcohol
-cooks out when
-baked--flavor remains.)
3 1/2 c  (1 lb) pecan meats
Cream butter until soft in your largest mixing bowl.  Combine white
and brown sugar thoroughly. Gradually work half the sugar mixture
into  butter, keeping it as smooth as possible. In a separate bowl
beat eggs  until light and fluffy.  Then gradually beat in remaining
sugar until  you have a smooth, creamy mixture. Stir into butter
mixture thoroughly. Sift flour, salt and mace together. Add flour
combination and the whiskey to the batter--alternating them and
beginning and ending with  the flour.  Break pecans into pieces and
stir then into the batter.  Pour into a well-greased 10 inch tube pan
(batter should almost fill the  pan) and bake in a preheated 300 F.
oven for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours OR until the cake shrinks slightly from
pan. Allow cake to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then turn it
out onto a cake rack, and cool completely. Bourbon cake improves with
age. It should be well-wrapped in foil and stored in the
refrigerator. DO NOT FREEZE.
