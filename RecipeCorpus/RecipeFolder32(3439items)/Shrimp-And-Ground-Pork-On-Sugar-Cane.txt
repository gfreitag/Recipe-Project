1.  If using dried shrimp, soak for about 1 hour in warm water.
Squeeze out excess water and chop finely.  Wash the fresh shrimp and
chop finely. 2.  Put the ground pork into a large bowl.  Add the
onion, cilantro, fresh and dried shrimp, salt and pepper, and Nuac
Mam sauce. 3. Pour the egg into the pork and shrimp mixture, and mix
well with your hand. The mixture should come together so that it can
be molded around the lengths of sugar cane, or around bamboo skewers.
It is is too runny, sift a little all-purpose flour or 4. Peel the
sugar cane, leaving 1 inch of the green covering on at each end, or 2
inch at one end. Mold the mixture on to the peeled part of the sugar
cane. 5. Broil the sticks under a moderately hot broiler, turning to
ensure evenness in the cooking. Make sure that the sugar cane does
not burn. Alternatively, deep-fry in hot oil for 4-5 minutes. 6.
Serve on a bed of lettuce. The sugar cane should be chewed or suched
as you eat the shrimp and pork.
