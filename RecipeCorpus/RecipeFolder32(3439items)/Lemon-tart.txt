Title: Lemon tart
Categories: Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
250 g  Sweet flan pastry
Butter and flour for the
- tart tin
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3    Eggs
1    Egg yolk
3    Lemons; juice
1    Orange; juice
1 1/2 dl Double cream
150 g  Sugar
Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC (500 oF).

Butter and lightly flour a 20 cm tart tin with a removable base. Line
it with the pastry and blind-bake it for 10-15 minutes. Take care to
protect the pastry with a disc of aluminium foil, which should be
pressed up to and over the edges before it is weighted down. When
itis cooked, let it cool without taking it out of the tin. Lower the
oven temperature to 180 oC (350 oF).

Whisk all the ingredients for the tart filling together - the eggs,
orange and lemon juice, cream and sugar.

When the mixture is nice and frothy, pour most of it into the tart
shell. The mixture needs to come right to the top, but to avoid
spilling it put the partly filled tart into the oven (with the
temperature now reduced) and finish filling it with a spoon.

Bake the tart with the oven door ajar, and wait until the filling has
become firm. This should take about 35 minutes. Check the firmness of
the filling by giving the tin a little shake.

Take the tart out of the tin when it is lukewarm and leave it on a
cake rack to cool.
