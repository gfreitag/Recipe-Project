Categories: Salads, Dress/stuff, Oldies
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Flour
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Vinegar
1/3 c  Water
2    Eggs -- well beaten
1 ts Butter
In a saucepan, mix flour, sugar, dry mustard and salt. Stir in the
vinegar and water; add the eggs. Cook, stirring all the while, until
thick. Add butter; chill. You may want to thin this with a little
cream when ready to use, as it does get pretty thick.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
