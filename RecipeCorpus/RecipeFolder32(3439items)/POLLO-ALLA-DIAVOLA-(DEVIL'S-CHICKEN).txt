Title: POLLO ALLA DIAVOLA (DEVIL'S CHICKEN)
Categories: Italian, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1    3 - 4 lb chicken
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 tb Hot pepper sauce *
2    Lemons, juice only
1 tb Black pepper, freshly ground
1 ts Salt
Pepper to taste
*  Tabasco or the like

Using poultry shears, cut the bird open by cutting down the backbone.
Flatten a bit by pounding with your hand so that the chicken is
"butterflied."

Mix the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and marinate the bird
for 2 hours.

Grill on a medium-hot charcoal barbecue, skin side down, for 25
minutes. Turn and cook until the juices run clear, about another 20
minutes. Keep basting with the remaining marinade.
