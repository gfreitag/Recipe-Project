Have meat and vegetables cut, sauce ingredients set out and everything
ready before you start to cook!

Combine the soy sauce, sherry, sugar, cornstarch, add them with the
sliced beef and stir so that the pieces of beef are coated with the
marinade.

Heat the fry pan or wok. When the pan is hot, pour in 2 tb. of oil,
when the oil is hot, saute the ginger root in the oil for 2 minutes.
Remove and discard the ginger root. Add the beef to the oil in the
pan and stir till it is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove and
keep hot.

Add 2 tb. of oil to the wok. When the oil is hot, add the mushrooms.
stir fry for 2 minutes. Push the mushrooms to the side of the wok,
Add another tb. of oil and when it is hot, add vegies that take
longer to cook first. Then add the easier to digest when raw vegies
(such as scallions) Stir fry for another minute. Pour in the stock
and cornstarch mixture and continue cooking until clear and bubbly.
Return beef to the pan and heat through. serve immediately.

Stir frying is a kind of free-wheeling cooking. It all goes together
very fast and practice will help you develop your "feel" for the
cooking. Vegetables should be crispy tender and the meat should be
tender and juicy.
