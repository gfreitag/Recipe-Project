1 qt Vanilla Ice Cream
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Line two 8 or 9-inch round cake
pans with aluminum foil, allowing the foil to extend over the sides
of the pan.
Spray with non-stick cooing spray or grease lightly.  For the
topping, combine the oats, flour, and brown sugar, cut in the peanut
butter and margarine until the mixture is crumbly, then set aside.
For the brownie layers, in a medium saucepan, over low heat, melt the
margarine and chocolate pieces, stirring frequently.  Remove from the
heat and cool slightly.  Stir in the sugar and vanilla, blending
well. Add the eggs, one at a time, blending well.  Combine the flour,
oats, baking powder and salt, blending well, then add the mixture to
the chocolate mixture, mixing well. Divide evenly between the
prepared pans. Sprinkle each with half the reserved topping, patting
it down gently. Bake 22-24 minutes for the 8-inch layers and 20-22
minutes for the 9-inch layers, or until the center is set. DO NOT
overbake! Cool completely, in the pans, on wire racks. Soften the ice
cream in the refrigerator for about 15 to 20 minutes.  To assemble
the sandwich, spread the ice cream over one of the brownie layers,
while it is still in the pan.  Lift the second layer out of the pan
and remove the foil.  With the topping side up, place the second
brownie layer on top of the ice cream, pressing down gently. Cover
with foil and freeze for several hours or overnight.  Remove from the
freezer 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  Lift from the pan, using
the foil edges and remove the foil totally.  Cut into 12 wedges.
