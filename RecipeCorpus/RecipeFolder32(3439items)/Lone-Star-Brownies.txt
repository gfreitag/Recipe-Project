Title: Lone Star Brownies
Categories: Chocolate, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 recipe
1 c  Butter
2 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
1 tb Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/3 c  Cocoa
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Chopped pecans
2 c  Miniature marshmallows
12 oz Pkg. semi-sweet chocolate
-- morsels
Melt butter.  Add sugar, eggs and vanilla.  Stir well.  Stir in
flour, cocoa and salt and beat with spoon about 30 times.  Stir in
pecans and pour into greased and floured baking dish.  Bake at 350
degrees for 30 - 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with
marshmallows and chocolate morsels.  Bake another five minutes to
soften marshmallows. Let cool for 10 minutes, then lightly swirl the
marshmallows and chocolate chips to give a "marbled" icing.

NOTE: One of our favorites are my own special brownies. I named them
`Lone Star Brownies.'  My reason for giving my brownies that name is
because I had always heard that things in Texas are bigger, better,
and richer -- usually all three.

This is a variation of an old favorite, Mississippi Mud.  Adding more
pecans and dark chocolate just make these brownies extra rich!
