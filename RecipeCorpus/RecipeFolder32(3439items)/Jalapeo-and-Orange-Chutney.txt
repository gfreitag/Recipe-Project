Title: Jalapeo and Orange Chutney
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 5 cups
10    Oranges
2 tb Jalapeo peppers, minced
-roasted, peeled, seeded
2 ts Ginger, peeled and minced
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
6 tb Honey
Cut 4 of the oranges, unpeeled, into thin slices and set them aside.
Grate the rind off one of the remaining oranges (there should be 1
tbs orange zest) and squeeze the juice out of all of the oranges.
Scrape the pulp out of the squeezed oranges and add it to the juice.

Combine the grated orange zest, juice and orange pulp, the jalapeo
pepper, ginger, sugar, and water in a large saucepan. Cook the
mixture slowly until the sugar is dissolved. Add the honey and the
orange slices. Simmer for about 15 minutes or until the sliced
oranges are transparent. Keeping the orange slices intact, drain the
mixture through a strainer, reserving the liquid. Set the orange
slices aside and reduce the liquid over low heat until it has
thickened; this will take about 30 minutes. Combine the reduced
liquid with the orange slices; you should have about 5 cups.

Bake in a pastry shell for a light, refreshing dessert or serve as a
relish on bread or crackers, or over cream cheese with crackers for
an appetizer. Vincent's Cookbook by Vincent Guerithault ISBN
