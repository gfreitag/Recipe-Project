Pastry for turnovers
1 ea Egg yolk
1/4 c  Skim milk
2 tb Coarse, granulated sugar
Preheat oven to 425F.  In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, 1/4
cup of the sugar and the cold water.  Bring to a simmer over medium
high heat and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain in a fine
sieve. Transfer to a medium bowl.  Combine with the pears, remaining
1/4 cup of sugar, the vanilla and the mint.  Meanwhile, place the
dough on a lightly floured counter top.  Roll the dough to 1/8 inch
thick slab. Cut into approximately ten 4-1/2 squares.  Spoon about
2-3 tbsp of the filling mixture into the center of the pastry square.
Repeat with the remaining filling and pastry. In a small bowl, whisk
together the egg yolk and the skim milk. Brush the edges of the
pastry with the mixture. Fold the pasry over to touch the adjoining
edges to form a triangle. With the tines of a fork, press the edges
of the pastry, snip a little cut to allow the cooking pastry to vent.
Vrush the top of the pastry with the egg mixture. Sprinkle the top
with the coarse granulated sugar. Transfer to a nonstick cookie
sheet. Bake on the lower rack of the oven until golden, about 20
minutes. Remove and transfer to a cake rack to cool. Serve warm.
