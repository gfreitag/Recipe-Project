Clean, wash and dry pheasant. Season with salt and pepper. Heat
butter and olive oil in a casserole and brown pheasant on all sides.
Add onions and chestnuts and cook over low heat until lightly brown.
Sprinkle with flour and add broth, stirring gently to the boiling
point. Combine orange juice, currant jelly, bay leaf and thyme. Cover
tightly and bake in a preheated 350 oven for one and a half hours,
basting frequently. Baste with the seasoning and discard bay leaf.
