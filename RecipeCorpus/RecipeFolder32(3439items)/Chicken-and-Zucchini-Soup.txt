1 lb Sweet Italian sausages cut

Salt and pepper to taste
Place the chicken in a 6-quart pot.  Add all the ingredients
through the parsnip, plus the parsley sprigs, lemon slice,
peppercorns, and 1 tsp salt. Add the chicken stock and enough water
to cover the chicken by 2 inches. Heat to boiling, skimming any
residue as it gathers. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered,
1 hour.
Remove the chicken from the stock and set the stovk aside. Allow
the chicken to cool enough to handle, then carefully remove the meat
from the bones and cut it into bite-size pieces. Cover and reserve.
Return the bones and skin to the stock.  Returen it to the boil;
reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 45 minutes. Strain the stock
into another pot, pressing the vegetables gently with the back of a
spoon to release their juices. Meanwhile, saute the sausage

pieces in a lightly oiled heavy skillet until well browned, about 8
minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Add the sausages to the stock. Heat
to boiling; reduce the heat. Simmer, uncovered, skimming any fat that
rises to the surface, for 20 minutes. Add the pasta shells; cook 10
minutes longer. Add the zucchini and the reserved chicken; cook 5
minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with the chopped
parsley.
