Clean and truss a large pheasant and put it in a large kettle with one
large red onion, two dried chili peppers seeded and crushed, one
carrot and one fresh chili pepper seeded. Add cold water to cover and
salt and pepper to taste. Bring the water to a boil, skim if
necessary and simmer the pheasant until tender, do not overcook.
Remove the pheasant from the broth, and disjoint it into twelve
pieces and set aside. Strain the stock, measure three cups, if
necessary add a little water. Return the liquid to the kettle, add
one and a half cups of rice and cook for twenty minutes or until
liquid has been absorbed. Soak a half teaspoon of dried saffron in a
little hot water for five minutes then stir into rice. In a skillet,
saute two finely chopped onions, two garlic cloves crushed and cook
in a half cup of oil until golden brown. remove the vegetables, drain
and stir them into the rice. Add the pheasant pieces to the oil
remaining in the skillet and saute over high heat until they are
crisp and golden brown on all sides. Add the pheasant to the rice and
toss the mixture gently with a fork.
