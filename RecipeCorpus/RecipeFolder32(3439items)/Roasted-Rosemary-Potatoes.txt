Title: Roasted Rosemary Potatoes
Categories: Potatoes, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2 1/2 lb Small red potatoes
Olive oil
Seasoning salt
Dried rosemary leaves
This a method more so than a recipe.  For those who require
quantities, I recommend about 1/4 cup oil, about 2 tsp seasoning
salt, and about 2 TBS dried rosemary leaves. Cut potatoes into
quarters, about bite-size pieces. Do not peel.  In a large bowl, toss
potatoes in oil to coat. There shouldn't be a lot of oil left in the
bowl. Sprinkle with seasoning salt and rosemary leaves, then turn a
couple of times to coat. Cover a large baking sheet with aluminum
foil and spray LIGHTLY with cooking spray. Place potatoes on a single
layer on the sheet. Roast in a pre-heated 400 degree oven for 45 to
55 minutes, until golden brown and slightly puffed. You may turn
potatoes once, after 25 minutes, if you wish. Serve ASAP from oven.
If desired you may adjust seasoning (more salt) before serving.
