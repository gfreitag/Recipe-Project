Title: Budino di Carciofi (Individual Artichoke Molds)
Categories: Vegetables, Italian, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
2    Eggs
2 oz Heavy cream
3 oz Grated Pecorino
1/2 ts Minced mint
1/4    Onion, minced
Fresh black pepper
1 sl Of lean bacon minced
6    Artichoke bottoms*
Salt
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Olive oil
* To prepare the artichoke bottoms, remove the outer leaves of the
artichokes and steam them lightly, using about 1 inch of water in the
pan. This should take about 10 to 12 minutes.(The insides of the
artichokes should not be cooked entirely through.) Remove from pan
and let cool. When you can handle them, peel off the remaining
leaves, and if there are chokes remove them. Hollow out the inside of
each enough so that there is a small cup in each bottom. Trim the
stems so that they can sit in small ramekins without toppling over.

1. Saute the bacon in the olive oil without crisping it. Remove and
drain on paper. Discard all but 1/2 tablespoon of the fat and cook
the onion in it until translucent. Do not brown. Remove and drain on
paper.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 350-F. Beat the eggs, cream, and Pecorino
together, then stir in mint, onion, salt and pepper.

3. Place the artichokes in ramekins that have been lightly oiled and
have had equal portions of the broth poured in the bottom of them.
Set the artichoke bottoms in the ramekins. Stir the egg mixture once
more and with a small table ladle, fill each hollow almost to the top
of the rims. Sprinkle lightly with Pecorino and bake until custard is
just set. Cool on a rack, invert on plates and serve garnished with
mint. Source: Journal of Italian Food & Wine
