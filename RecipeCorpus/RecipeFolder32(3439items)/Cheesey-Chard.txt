Title: Cheesey Chard
Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Rice (brown basmati is nice)
1/2 md Onion, cut in chunks
2 tb Olive oil
pn Black pepper, fresh ground
2 qt Chard, fresh, cut in 2" pcs.
6 oz Montery jack
-or mild white cheddar
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
1 cn Baby corn
2 c  Squash vine tips, peeled
-cut in 1" pieces
Soy sauce or tamari
Cook the rice with approp. amount of water for the rice; I use a rice
cooker and equal amounts of rice and water; twice the water for
standard covered pot and brown rice.

Wash and drain the chard, remove and discard stems, and cut leaves in
2 inch squares.

While the rice is cooking (about 8 minutes before it is done), saute
the onion, and squash vine if used, in the olive oil with a grind or
two of black pepper. Add the drained baby corn, if used, and cover to
heat through.

Add the chard just when the rice is done cooking. Turn off the heat.
Add the hot rice and grate the cheese on top. Mix quickly so the
cheese melts, but not so much so that everything sticks together.

Serve with soy sauce, if desired.
