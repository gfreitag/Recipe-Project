MMMMM---------------------------MEATS--------------------------------
Beef and poultry are used
-sparingly as they have a
-strong flavor.  Pork is too
-sweet to make a good soup.
FILLER:  There are may ingredients which make soups heartier - try any
one... rice, potato, beans, barley, lentils, peas or noodles.

VEGETABLES: Tomatoes, both canned and fresh, onions, parnsips, leeks
or celery make good soup.  Turnips, broccoli stems and lima bean
should be used sparingly because of strong flavour.  Peas, corn and
carrots are too sweet to be used alone.

THICKENING: Add the following per cup of soup liquid: 1 tsp barley, 1
tsp rice, 1 tsp oatmeal, 2 tbsp wheat germ, 2 tbsp soy flour or 1-1/2
tsp flour. These work best when mixed in cold water and then added to
the soup. Leftover gravy is an excellent soup thickener.

SEASONINGS: Salt, pepper and a selections of peppercorns, paprika,
thyme, bayleaf, barley, cayenne, mace or allspice are generally used
in seasoning soups. Season lightly in the beginning, adding more
seasoning immediately before serving. Soup is best one day old whe
nit's flavor has intensified. Grease forms a cake that is easily
removed from cold soup.
