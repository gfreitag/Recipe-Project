Title: Red and Yellow Bell Pepper Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2 lg Red bell peppers, roasted
2 lg Yellow bell peppers, roasted
2 tb Shallots, chopped
2 tb Olive oil
4 c  Chicken stock
2 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper to taste
Keeping the colors separate, peel the roasted peppers, remove the
seeds, and dice the flesh. Using 2 pans, saut 1 tbs chopped shallot
in half the olive oil in each pan; add the diced pepper, the red to
one pan, the yellow to the other, and saut for 2 minutes. Add 2 cups
of chicken stock to each pan and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.
Add 1 cup of cream to each pan and simmer the mixtures for about 5
minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Separately, pure the mixtures
in a blender until smooth.

When both soups are made, pour them, using two ladles,
simultaneously, into soup bowls, one color on each side. Serve hot.
