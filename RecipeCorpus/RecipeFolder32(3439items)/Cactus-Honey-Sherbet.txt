Title: Cactus Honey Sherbet
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
3 md Peaches
1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Cold water
1 c  Prickly pear juice
1 1/2 c  Prickly pear pieces
1/2 c  Honey
5 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Whipping cream
Plunge the peaches into a large pot of boiling water for one minute;
using a slotted spoon, transfer them immediately to a large bowl of
cold water. The skins should slip off easily.  Slice the peaches.
There should be about 1 1/2 cups.

Sprinkle gelatin over the 1/4 cup of cold water in a small bowl.  Set
aside.  Combine 1 cup prickly pear juice with peach slices and
prickly pear pieces in a medium saucepan.  Simmer over low heat for
five minutes.

Turn off the heat under the fruit and strain off 1 cup of juice.  In a
small saucepan, combine the juice and honey and cook gently just at a
simmer for eight minutes.  Add the softened gelatin and lemon juice
to the honey mixture and stir until gelatin is dissolved.

Puree the fruit and remaining juice in a blender.  Combine with the
gelatin and honey mixture and freeze in a bread pan or similar
container. When nearly hard, remove from freezer, transfer to a bowl,
and beat with an electric mixer.  Beat the whipping cream until stiff
and fold into the fruit mixture.  Return to the bread pan.  Refreeze
until firm.
