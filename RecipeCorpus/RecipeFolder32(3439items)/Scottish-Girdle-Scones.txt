Title: Scottish Girdle Scones
Categories: Scot/irish, Breakfast, Breads
Yield: 1 batch
8 oz Flour
1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 oz Butter
1 ts Golden syrup
8 oz Buttermilk, full cream
- milk, or sour milk
Sift the flour into a bowl.  Add the other dry ingredients and mix.
Rub in the butter.  Add the syrup and the milk and mix with a palette
knife to a soft consistency.  Turn on to a floured surface and roll
quickly and lightly (handle as little as possible) to about 3/4 inch
thick. Cut into rounds.  Grease and heat the girdle or heavy
frying-pan (it should be quite hot).  Lift the scones on to the
girdle and, with a slice or broad knife, turn once until brown on
both sides. Serve freshly baked, spread with butter.
