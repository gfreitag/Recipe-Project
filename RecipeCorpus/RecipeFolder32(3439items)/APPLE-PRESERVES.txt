Title: APPLE PRESERVES
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
6 c  Peeled-cored-sliced apples
1 tb Lemon juice
1    Lemon; thinly sliced
4 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
1 pk Pectin
2 ts Ground nutmeg
This is NOT jam.  I like to use these warmed as a side dish (like

escalloped apples). This is from the Ball Blue Book.

Mix apples, water, lemon juice in large pot. Simmer covered 10 min.
Stir in pectin and bring to full rolling boil, stir frequently. Add
lemon slices/sugar and bring to full rolling boil again and boil for
1 min, stir frequently.  Remove from heat and add nutmeg. Pour into
hot jars or cool and put into freezer containers. If canning, process
10 min in boiling water bath. Yield 6 half pints.   IF FREEZING, MAKE
SURE YOU COOL FIRST, IT WILL BE HOT ENOUGH TO MELT PLASTIC !!!! (I
speak from experience !)
