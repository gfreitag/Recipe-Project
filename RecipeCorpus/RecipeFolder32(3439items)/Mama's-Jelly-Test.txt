Title: Mama's Jelly Test
Categories: Information, Can/preserv, Dips/spread
Yield: 1 servings  Testing for jelly-- Take a little cooked juice in a spoon, cool
slightly and pour slowly back into kettle from the edge of the spoon.
If the jelly is not cooked sufficiently the juice will fall in 2
parallel drops. When the jelly is cooked sufficiently the drops run
together and fall from the spoon in a flake or sheet leaving the edge
of the spoon clean. Remove from the heat and skim. Pour immediately
into glases or jars. Pour carefully to avoid splashes or drops on the
rim, since these cause a poor seal with the paraffin.
