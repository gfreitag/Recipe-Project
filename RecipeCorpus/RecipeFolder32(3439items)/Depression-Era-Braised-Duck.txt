Truss duck as for roasting or cut into joints. Cut the pork into small
pieces and fry. Add vegetables, bay leaf and parsley; cook 5 minutes.
Put in duck and fry till browned. Place the whole works in a baking
dish, add water, cover closely and cook in a moderate oven till
tender, adding more water if need be. Dish up, and thicken gravy with
flour and butter mixture. Season highly and serve with currant jelly
or apple sauce. Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
