Spice (Harvard Common Press, 1994), a guide to cooking with smoke.

1. Rub each pork chop with 1 teaspoon spice rub, then sprinkle with
salt. Let rubbed chops stand, loosely covered, in refrigerator for 2
to 3 hours. (Can be sealed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for 2 to
4 days.)

2. Following instructions for grill or smoker setup (see "How To
Smoke-Cook with a Kettle-Style Grill" or "How To Smoke-Cook with a
Water Smoker," page 19), soak wood chunks and set up grill or smoker.

3. Smoke pork chops until chops are firm but not hard, about 1 1/2
hours. Serve.
