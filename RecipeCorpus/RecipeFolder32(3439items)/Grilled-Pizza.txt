Categories: Breadmaker, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Water
3 tb Water (only if needed)
2 tb Olive oil
2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Cornmeal
3 c  Flour
2 ts Yeast
MMMMM-------------------------TOPPINGS:------------------------------
3 tb Olive oil
2    Cloves garlic -- minced
1/2 c  Mixed fresh herbs (basil,
Thyme, oregano)
1/2 c  Fontina cheese -- shredded
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese -- grated
6    Sun-dried tomatoes,
Oil-packed -- in 1/4's
Place dough ingredients in machine and program for knead and first
rise. Press start.  Check after 5 minutes and add extra water if
needed, 1 tbsp at a time.  Preheat grill.  When dough has finished,
transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface and use your hands
to push and flatten the dough into a rough 10 to 12" circle.  Lay the
dough on the grill and let it cook for 1 minute, or until it puffs
slightly and the underside stiffens and grill marks appear.  Use a
wide spatula  or tongs to turn it over and place it on the side of
the grill (off the direct heat).  Quickly brush the top with half the
oil and distribute the garlic, herbs and cheeses over the top.  Add
the sun-dried tomatoes and finally drizzle on the remaining oil.
Slide the pizza back to the middle of the grill and continue cooking
while you rotate it to assure even cooking.  Cook about 5 to 6
minutes. Serve immediately.
