Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 servings
4    To 5 unpeeled apples
2 tb Unflavored gelatin
1/2 c  Cold water
2 c  Sugar
1 tb Cornstarch
1/8 ts Salt
2/3 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
1 ts Grated lemon peel
1 tb Lemon juice
1/3 c  Confectioners' sugar (for
-rolling)
Wash apples; without peeling or coring, cut in small pieces.  Cook
until very tender in just enough water to avoid scorching.  Put
through a food mill or sieve and measure 2 cups pulp into a 2 quart
heavy saucepan. Cook until thick, stirring often.

Soften gelatin in cold water. Mix sugar, cornstarch and salt; add to
apple pulp.  Cook again over low heat, stirring constantly, until
mixture is very thick.  Add gelatin; stir until gelatin is dissolved
and mixture is again thick.  Remove from heat.

Stir in walnuts, lemon peel, and juice.  Turn into an 8" square
shallow glas dish that has been rinsed with cold wate.  Let stand 24
hours.

Cut rectangles (about 60).  Roll in confectioners sugar, and place on
rack until outside is dry.  Store in covered container.   Makes about
1 pound 12 ounces.

Note: You can use 2 cups sweetened canned applesauce to make this
confection, but reduce the amount of sugar from 2 to 1-1/3 cups.
