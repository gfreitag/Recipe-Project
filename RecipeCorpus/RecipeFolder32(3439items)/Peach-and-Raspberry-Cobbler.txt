2 tb Cornstarch
2 ts Lemon juice
1 pt Raspberries
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder

Heat oven to 400. Peel peaches and slice. Combine them with 3/4 cup
of sugar, the cornstarch and lemon juice. Gently stir in raspberries.
Transfer to 2-qt. baking dish. Cover with foil. Bake until juices are
bubbling, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup sugar, flour,
baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Stir milk into flour mixture until ingredients just hold
together. Drop eight heaping spoonfuls of dough onto hot fruit and
sprinkle remaining sugar on dough. Bake, uncovered, until the
biscuits have browned, about 25 minutes.
