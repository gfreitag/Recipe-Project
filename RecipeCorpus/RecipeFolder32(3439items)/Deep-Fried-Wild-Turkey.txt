Title: Deep-Fried Wild Turkey
Categories: Game, Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Wild turkey, whole, dressed
2 1/2 ga Peanut oil
1 c  Italian salad dressing
1/2 c  Lemon juice, fresh
3 tb Onion juice
3 tb Garlic juice
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Liquid smoke
1 1/3 oz Cayenne
1/4 c  Salt
Mix all ingredients except turkey, pot and peanut oil to make a
marinade. Let stand overnight in refrigerator. Use meat injecting
needle to inject all through turkey. Put turkey and marinade in a
large plastic bag and keep in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 days.
Remove in time to bring to room temp before cooking. Heat oil in a
40-60 quart pot to 325 degrees (Use candy thermometer). Immerse
turkey completely and cook for 4 minutes per pound. Place a pie tin
with holes in the bottom in the bottom of the deep fryer to prevent
sticking. This is supposed to be a red-hot favorite. Try one. Recipe
