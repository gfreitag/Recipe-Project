Trim and remove excess fat and lightly salt lamb chops.

Toast cumin seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan
frequently, just until they become golden and fragrant.  Grind them
in a spice mill or crush with a mortar and pestle.

In a shallow Pyrex dish or pie plate, combine cumin with garlic,
lemon rind and juice, orange juice, and basil and oil, mixing well.
Add the lamb chops, pressing the herb and spice mixture onto both
sides of the meat.

Marinate at room temperature for several hours or overnight in the
refrigerator.  Barbecue chops over charcoal, basting occasionally with
marinade.  Serve garnished with fresh lemon slices and green basil
sprigs.
