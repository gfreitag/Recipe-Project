Rigatoni con Sugo di Carciofo (Rigatoni with Creamed Artichoke Sauce)

Salt Freshly ground fresh pepper Pecorino cheese

1. Slice the artichokes in quarters the long way and cook in the
butter and oil combined over medium low heat taking care not to burn
the butter. Turn, so artichokes cook on all sides.

2. Slice the onion thinly and quarter the garlic. Cook with the
artichokes for 5 more minutes. Remove the garlic pieces. Add the
tomato paste and reduced broth minus the bay leaf. Cook for another
five minutes, incorporating all the elements thoroughly.

3. Add the heavy cream and stir, cooking over very low heat. Add salt
and generous amounts of freshly ground black pepper. Do not boil the
sauce at this point.

4. Spoon over the rigatoni, cooked firmly.

Variation Finished in the Oven

Pre-heat the oven to 375-F. Gently stir into sauce and pasta 1/4 cup
Pecorino. Turn into a greased casserole dish and sprinkle liberally
with more Pecorino. Bake for 20 minutes or until top is browned.

Variation II

Follow the base recipe and the first variation. However, before
placing in oven, sprinkle lightly with freshly-grated fine bread
crumbs. Then sprinkle on a bit of the Pecorino. Next, dot with butter
and place in oven for 20 minutes. Browning time may be slightly
shorter.

A final note: The above dishes may be topped with slices of fresh
tomato (seeded and juiced) before the topping goes on and casserole
is baked.
