3/4 lb Swiss Chard leaves, stemmed,

1/2 ts Coarse salt

In a pot, steam the chard leaves until tender, about 5 minutes.  Set
leaves in a colander to drain.  Squeeze out the excess moisture and
shred coarsely.

Crush garlic in a mortar with salt, coriander and chile until a thick,
crumbly paste forms.

Heat olive oil in a 10 inch skillet and saute onion until pale
golden. Add garlic paste and tomato paste and stir into oil until
sizzling. Add chard, garbanzos, and cooking liquid, and cook,
stirring occasionally for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and let stand
until ready to serve. Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold, with
lemon wedges. (I think it is best when warm or at room temp).
