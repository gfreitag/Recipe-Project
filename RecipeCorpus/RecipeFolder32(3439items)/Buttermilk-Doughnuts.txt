Title: Buttermilk Doughnuts
Categories: Breads
Yield: 30 servings
3    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Oil
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
1 ts Ginger
1 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
5 1/2 c  Flour -- not sifted
Preheat fat fryer to 350 degrees.  Mix the eggs, sugar, oil and
buttermilk with a wire whisk until the sugar is dissolved and the
yolks are broken up and distributed.  Add the spices, vanilla, baking
powder, baking soda and salt; mix well.  Fold the flour into the
mixture until the ingredients are no longer wet.  Let sit for 5-10
minutes.  The batter will thicken by itself without needing more
flour, which would toughen the doughnuts. Drop half the dough onto a
floured board and knead lightly into a ball with folded ends
underneath. Roll the dough into a round shape 1/2 inch thick. Cut
with a doughnut cutter. Knead the leftover dough into the second half
of the mixture. Repeat kneading and rolling. Be very sparing with the
flour. Dust the dough very lightly, but don't overflour. Your dough
should not be sticky if left to rest 5-10 minutes as instructed. Cook
the doughnuts in hot oil, 1 inch deep in the pan. Brown the doughnuts
for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.
