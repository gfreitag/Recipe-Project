This is and easy recipe that tastes very similar to the pudding pops
available in the stores.  The kids will love 'em.

Use the quantity of milk recommended on the pudding box. Place the
Cocoa in small bowl and add the milk, a little at a time, mixing into
a smooth paste.  Continue adding the milk until all is combined with
the cocoa. Using the milk and cocoa mix, make the pudding according
to the box recipe. Cook until thick and pour into molds.  Add the
sticks after a few minutes when the pudding begins to set.  Place the
molds in the freezer for a few hours until frozen.  If you like you
can make several batches and store the frozen pops in plastic bags
placed in the freezer. Submitted By JOHN PRATHER   On   07-18-95
