Title: "Patouli" - tabouli with potatoes instead of couscous
Categories: Salads, Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
20 sm New red potatoes
2 c  Parsley, fresh, chopped fine
2 tb Mint leaves, fresh, chopped
3/4 c  Diced spring onion
- including some of the tops
1    Tomato, ripe, diced
1/2    Lemon, juiced
4 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
2 tb Olive oil
Wash the potatoes and put on to steam until tender.

Finely chop and combine the parsley, mint, onions, and tomato.
Squeeze in the lemon juice. Mix thouroughly.

Crumble the feta and turn into the salad makings.

Drain the potatoes and place five in in a shallow bowl. Cover with
1/4 of the salad mixture. Potatoes should be mashed or sliced by the
person eating. No salt or butter is necessary, really.

This dish was born of necessity when I intended to make tabouli, but
found I had no bulgur (which I use instead of couscous), but did have
fresh, new potatoes. The dish made a meal! The kind one feels good
after.
