Roast the pheasant and keep it just underdone. When quite cold lift
out the breast and leave the legs and wings attached to the bird. By
means of scissors, completely bone the bird; garnish it inside with a
truffled foie gras Parfait and cover it with a thin coat of foie gras
Mousse. Replace the breast upon this Mousse, after having sliced
them, and fill any gap that exist between the slices with some of the
same Mousse, thus, reconstructing the bird. Let the Mousse set
thoroughly and glaze with aspic jelly.
