Title: Yankee Corn Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Butter or margarine
3 tb Honey
2 c  Buttermilk
2 lg Eggs, beaten
1 3/4 c  Corn meal
1 c  Whole wheat flour
3/4 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8 X 8 baking dish. Melt the butter
and honey together in a small saucepan or microwavable dish. Add to
buttermilk and eggs and beat well. Sift the dry ingredients together
and add to buttermilk mix, combining well. Pour into greased dish and

more cake-like and moist, while Southern-style cornbreads tend to be
drier and more crumbly (higher proportion of corn meal. Both are GOOD!
