as good as the Super Nachos served at Loma-Linda's just outside
Toledo." - Pat Garcia

In a small bowl, mash the avocado with lemon juice. Stir in the onion,
tomato, salt and pepper; set aside. Mash beans with 1/3 cup water;
place in a skillet and cook over medium heat until hot. Stir in oil;
remove from the heat and set aside. In another skillet, brown beef;
drain. Stir in chili powder and remaining water; cook until liquid
evaporates. Line a baking sheet with foil. Arrange chips in a single
layer. Top with teaspoonfuls of bean and meat mixtures. Sprinkle with
cheese. Bake at 400 degrees until cheese is melted, about 4 min. Top
with avocado mixture and sour cream. Serve immediately. 6-8 servings.
