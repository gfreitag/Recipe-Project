Title: Sugar classifications and names
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 servings
English castor sugar is the
-equivalent of USA
-superfine sugar. English
Icing sugar is the
-equivalent of powdered
-sugar or 10x sugar (used to
Frost or "ice" cakes)
In England I used to put granulated sugar in the blender and blend
for a couple of seconds, no too long or it will turn into powdered
sugar. Actually, in the USA the regular granulated sugar is finer
than the British granulated sugar, so you could probably just use the
regular sugar with no detriment to the recipe. In fact a lot of
recipes calling for castor sugar can just as easily be made with
granulated sugar. Hope this helps. If you need any further assistance
converting British ingredients to US ingredients, do not hesitate to
ask:-) Shared by: Sylvia Mease
