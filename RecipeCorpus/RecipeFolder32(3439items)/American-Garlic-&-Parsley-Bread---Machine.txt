Title: American Garlic & Parsley Bread - Machine
Categories: Breads, Breadmaker
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
3 c  Bread flour
3 tb Wheat germ
3 tb Wheat bran
1 3/4 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Vegetable oil
2    Garlic cloves, minced
3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 1/4 c  Water
Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.  For DAK/Welbilt, use White bread setting.
Let the loaf cool before slicing.  Serve plain or toasted.
"This is good bread for a steak sandwich, French dip roast beef,
or a grilled mozzarella cheese and tomato sandwich.  Baking the
garlic right in the bread lightens the garlic flavor.  If this is not
a strong enough garlic statement for you, add another clove."
