Categories: Meats, Cajun/creol, Sausage, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
4 lb Lean fresh pork
2 lb Pork fat
2 ts Finely minced garlic
1 tb Cayenne pepper
1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Salt
1/2 ts Ground bay leaf
4 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Sugar
3    Yards sausage casing (opt.)
Grind the pork and fatback to a medium to coarse grind, and mix well
with the other ingredients.  Stuff into sausage casings, and tie them
off so that each sausage is about six inches long.  You can omit this
step and make sausage patties if you like.

Fresh sausage should be used quickly, and will keep in the
refrigerator for three days.  You can also freeze it for up to three
months.
