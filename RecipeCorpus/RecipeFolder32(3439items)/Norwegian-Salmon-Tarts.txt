TO MAKE PASTRY:  Cut Butter into flour with a pastry blender and add
water, a little at the time, until a stiff dough is formed. Roll and
cut out top and bottom crusts for 12 tarts.

TO MAKE FILLING:  In a skillet, melt butter, add onion and brown.  Add
mushrooms and sour cream; simmer for five minutes and cool. Meanwhile,
poach or steam fish until it flakes easily. Drain fish and flake in a
bowl. Mix whole eggs and dill with fish. Season with salt and pepper
to taste. Blend the fish and the mushroom mixtures and spoon into
bottom crusts. Top with second crust and pinch edges together to
seal. Brush egg white over top crusts and edges. Prick crusts for
steam vents. Bake 10 minutes at 450 degrees F., or until crust is
golden brown.

TO MAKE TOPPING:  Mix together sour cream and seasonings. Add a
spoonful to each tart before serving.
