SEPARATE LEAVES OF WHICHEVER type of green you're using. If using
escarole or curly endive, use just the pale inner leaves. (Outer
leaves can be sauteed with garlic and chile-- delicious!) Gently cut
or tear leaves into attractive pieces, wash and dry the If walnuts
are really fresh, simply crack them and break them into quarters and
eighths. If they aren't so fresh, toss them in a little walnut oil
and toast them at 350F until lightly roasted, about 7 minutes.
Prepare vinaigrette and use half of it to dress the leaves. Set them
on salad plates. Dress pears with remaining vinaigrette and settle
them into leaves. Scatter walnuts over salad along with cheese.
Garnish with chervil and dust lightly with pepper.

VINAIGRETTE: In bowl, combine vinegar with salt, then whisk in oils.
Adjust oil or vinegar to get the balance you like. DEBORAH MADISON -
