Title: Curried Mahi-Mahi Kebabs Belize
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Fish fillets *
1 lg Papaya; not too ripe
1 lg Plantain OR
-underripe banana
Vegetable oil (for grill)
Cilantro sprigs to garnish
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  White wine
1/4 c  Onion; minced
3 tb Cilantro; minced
1 tb Curry powder
Salt and pepper
* mahi-mahi, swordfish, shark, halibut

Rinse the mahi-mahi and pat dry with paper towels. Cut the fish into
1-inch cubes. In a shallow dish, combine the marinade ingredients and
mix well. Add the cubes of fish and toss to thoroughly coat. Cover
and refrigerate for 1 hour. If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a
bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before grilling.

Meanwhile, halve the papaya and scoop out and discard the seeds. peel
away the skin with a small knife or vegetable peeler. Cut the papaya
into 1-inch cubes. peel the plantain and cut across into 1-inch
pieces. Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red,
with white ash around the edges.

Take the fish cubes from the marinade, allowing excess to drip off;
reserve the marinade. Thread the fish onto the skewers, alternating
with pieces of papaya and plantain. Do not crowd ingredients on the
kebabs, but leave a little space between so they will cook evenly.
Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill, add the kebabs to
the hot grill and cook until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Brush a
little marinade over the kebabs, then turn and continue cooking until
the fish is opaque through, about 5 minutes.
