I finally found it and we are hooked. Thanks to my bread maker; we
have no excuse for not having a great homemade pizza in no time. I
hope you'll try it out and let me know how you like it. By the way,
this doesn't make a Pizza Hut type of pan pizza dough, instead it is
a hand-tossed type that is tender and not tough...delicious! Try it.
Another note: I have a Welbilt 350.

Put all ingredients in your bread maker on manual and let it do the
work. I let it rise for a little longer after it finishes, but judge
for yourself if it requires that. Divide into two 12" pies (I roll it
out) Put on two cornmeal covered pans, prick with a fork, brush with
oil, add toppings and preheat your oven to 500F. Let the pizzas rise
for 15 minutes or so, then bake for 7 minutes. MMMama Mia!! I've
gotten great recipes off this BB, so I thought I'd reciprocate! Hope
you like it!!
