Title: Best Ever Baked Beans
Categories: Vegetables, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
5 lb Pork and beans - canned
(actually 4 to 5 lbs.)
1/2 c  Onion - chopped
1/2 c  Celery - chopped
1/3 c  Bell pepper - chopped
2 tb Mustard - prepared
1/2 c  Molasses
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
3 dr Tabasco - actually 3 to 4
-drops
1/2 c  Barbecue sauce - bottled or
-homemade (see recipe)
1/2 c  Catsup
2    Strip bacon - uncooked and
-cut in half
Combine all ingredients, except in bacon, in large ovenproof
container. Lay bacon strips on top.  Place on smoker grid and smoke
for 2 to 2-1/2 hours.

Note from me:  If you don't have a smoker, you can cook at about 350F
for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the bacon is curling.  Better
flavor in a smoker, but divine beans without!

Makes 8 to 10 servings.

Recipe from "Cook'n Cajun Water Smoker Cookbook" by Sondra Hester.

This is undoubtedly one of the best baked bean dishes we've ever
tasted. Easy to make and no tending necessary.  You can have ribs
smoking on the bottom rack and beans on the top rack.  Add garlic
bread and coleslaw, potato salad or macaroni salad and you've got a
Super Bowl party, bowl game or Monday Night Football dinner! Source:
