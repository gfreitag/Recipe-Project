Rub this aromatic mixture onto salmon, mackerel, or bluefish fillets.

1. Toast fennel, coriander, and peppercorns over medium heat in small
skillet, shaking occasionally to prevent burning, until first wisps of
smoke appear, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cool to room
temperature, then mix with remaining ingredients.

2. Grind to powder in spice grinder or with mortar and pestle. Source:
