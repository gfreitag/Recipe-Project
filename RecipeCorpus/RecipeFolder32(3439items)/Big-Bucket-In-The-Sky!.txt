Wipe Chicken pieces dry.  Make paste of first 5 ingredients.  Brush
to coat chicken evenly with paste.  Cover skin-side and underside
well. Stack pieces in large refrigerator container.  Cover or seal in
foil. Refrigerate several hours or better yet -- overnight.

1 and 1/2 hours before serving, heat oil and Crisco till melted in
heavy saucepan.  Put just enough of this into 2 large heavy skillets
that it covers the bottom of the pans 1" deep.  The shortening will
have to be replaced as you remove the fried pieces and continue to
fry other pieces. Once it is melted, just set it aside.

Dip each paste covered piece of chicken first in milk and then into
pancake mixture, having combined it as directed above with the last 3
ingredients. Dust off excess and place skin-side down first in the
very hot oil mixture, browning the pieces on each side till golden
blond.

Place browned pieces in shallow baking pans in single layer,
skin-side up. Sopon remaining milk over pieces.  Seal with foil on 3
sides o pan, leaving 1 side unsealed.  Bake about 40 minutes at 375
degrees F -- or till chicken is fork tender.  Remove foil entirely
and bake another 8 to 10 minutes or till coating is crispy.  Baste
with milk and pan drippings ever few mintues.

Serves 6 to 8.  Leftovers keep up to a week refrigerated.
