Preparation: Shell the broad beans

Put the rice in a saucepan with the water, salt and saffron. Bring to
the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until all
the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to Gas Mark 5/190C/375F. Put the garlic
cloves in a small roasting tin with the oil and roast in the oven for
10-15 minutes or until they are soft and golden but not brown. Turn
them once to make sure they do not brown underneath.

Add the beans to the rice, pour on the stock and bring to the boil.
Add the garlic cloves and their oil, reduce the heat and simmer for
15 minutes. Remove from heat, cool a little then puree in a food
processor or blender. Taste and season to taste, then serve
immediately. Submitted By KAZ LANGRIDGE   On   07-02-95
