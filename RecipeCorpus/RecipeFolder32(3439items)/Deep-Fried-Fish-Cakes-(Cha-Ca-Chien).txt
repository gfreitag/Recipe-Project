1.  Cover the fish with the coconut milk.  (If there is not
sufficient add a little water or cow's milk.)  Bring the milt to a
boil and simmer for 10 minutes or until the fish is tender.  Remove
any skin or bones and flake the fish. 2. Place the fish, potato,
tomatoes, and cilantro in a bowl and mix well. 3. Combine the Nuoc
mam sauce and egg. Add half the mixture slowly to the fish mixture so
that it retains its shape. Add some flour if the mixture is too
runny. 4. Shape the mixture into small balls. Dip each ball into the
remaining egg and Nuoc Mam sauce mixture, and roll into the rice
flour. 5. Heat the oil until it is smoking and deep-fry until the
balls are golden brown. 6. Serve hot, garnished with the lettuce and
sprigs of mint.
