Title: BOB'S BUFFET BISCUITS
Categories: Breads, Usenet
Yield: 2 dozen
40 oz Biscuit mix
-(e.g. 1 box of Bisquick)
3/4 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1/3 c  Green onions, chopped
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
2 c  Milk
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a big bowl mix the biscuit mix,
onions, eggs, milk and about 1/2 cup of the cheese.

Put the dough into a  9x13 inch baking pan and smooth it down.  You
will have to flour your hand or spatula to do this. Sprinkle the rest
of the cheese over the top and then use the spatula or knife to score
the dough into square biscuits. Cut all the way to the pan.

Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 to 45 minutes.
When they are done a wooden toothpick stuck into the dough will come
out clean.

NOTES:

*  Some not-so-plain biscuits -- This recipe is from Bob Clover of
Sausalito, California and was first published in _Sunset_ magazine.
Yield: 24-30 biscuits.

*  When you take them out of the oven, flip the pan upside down over
a rack to get the biscuits out, then flip the rack over to get
everything back right side up again.

*  This is good if you are having a lot of company or want a lot of
leftovers.
