Title: Wild Rice and Mushrooms
Categories: Canadian, Rice, Game, Vegetables, Dips/spread
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Wild rice
1 1/3 c  Water -- cold
1 ts Chicken bouillon
2    Bacon slices
1/2 c  Mushrooms -- sliced
2 tb Green onion
Thyme -- dried Parsley -- snipped

Pour cold water over rice in strainer and lift rice with fingers (to
remove any impurities). Combine rice and 1 1/3 cups water and
bouillon. Bring to a boil, reduce heat. Cover and simmer 60 minutes.

* Meanwhile cook  bacon partially and add mushrooms, green onion and
thyme. Cook till bacon is crisp and mushrooms soft. Drain off fat.
Add to cooked rice. Season  with pepper. Sprinkle with chopped
parsley.

*Time consuming and expensive. Be prepared to give wild rice as much
cooking time as possible, occasionally it will require a bit more
time as it absorbs water more slowly than regular rice.
