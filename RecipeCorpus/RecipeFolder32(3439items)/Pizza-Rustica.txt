Place all dough ingredients in pan and program for knead and first
rise. The dough will be firm and pull away from the side of the
machine.  While the dough is rising, prepare the filling.  In mixing
bowl, whisk together all the ingredients and refrigerate until you
are ready to assemble the pizza.  Preheat the oven to 400 with the
rack in the center postion. Grease a 9" springform pan.  When the
dough cycle is completed transfer the dough to a lightly floured work
surface, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rest for 5 minutes.
Cut the dough in 2 pieces; one piece should be one third of the dough
and the other piece should be 2/3.  Roll out the larger piece to a
14" circle.  Line the springform pan with the circle. A small amount
of dough (1") should overlap the top of the pan. Arrange 5 slices of
salami on the bottom.  Spread a third of the ricotta filling over the
salami, then sprinkle on a third of the basil.  Lay out a third of
the peppers.  Lay out 4 slices of provolone.  Repeat this pattern for
the next 2 layers.  Roll out the small piece of dough to a 9" circle.
Brush water around the rim of the dough already in pan, then fit the
9" circle on top. Trim away about 1/2" of the overlapping dough from
the bottom circle. Crimp together the top and bottom edges.  Brush
the top of the dough with olive oil and salt and pepper.  With a pair
of scissors, cut a vent in the top crust about 1" in diameter.  Bake
for 15 minutes at 400, then at 350 for 15 minutes. Remove the pizza
from the oven and immediately remove the sides of the springform.
Cool before slicing to allow layers to set.
