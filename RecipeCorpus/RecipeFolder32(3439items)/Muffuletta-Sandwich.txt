Terry Thompson writes, in his book Cajun-Creole Cooking, "A visit to
New Orleans without eating a Muffuletta would be like a trip to
Ireland without kissing the Blarney Stone!  A Muffuletta, one of
life's great pleasures, it is a 10-inch round sandwich stuffed with
meats and cheese topped with a concoction known as Olive Salad.  In
New Orleans, the two best Muffulettas, bar none, can be had a Central
Grocery or at Napoleon House on Chartres Street.  At Central Grocery,
you stand in line at the counter to shout your order.  You can eat
your sandwich while wandering through the tiny, crowded grocery.
You'll find open barrels of flours and beans, wooden crates of dried
salt cod, huge jars of olive salad and oil-cured olives, every brand
of olive oil imaginable along with boxes of every size and shape of
pasta made.  The Napoleon House is a real cafe and bar located in one
of the French Quarter's oldest buildings.  Here you may dine
unmolested by elbows and tromping feet."
