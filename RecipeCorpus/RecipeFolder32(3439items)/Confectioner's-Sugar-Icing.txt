Title: Confectioner's Sugar Icing
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
1 tb Water
1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the butter and
water until the butter melts. Remove from heat and let stand until
cool, about 5 minutes. Add the sugar to the butter mixture and whisk
vigorously until smooth and thickened, about 1 minute. Use within 5
minutes, or the icing may become too thick to drizzle. If the icing
does become too thick, rewarm it for 2 to 3 seconds over low heat,
whisking constantly. Makes a scant 1/2 cup.

Variations: Orange flavor: Use 1 tablespoon undiluted thawed, frozen
orange juice concentrate in place of the water.

Brown sugar flavor:  Add 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar to the warm
butter mixture and stir until the sugar dissloves; let cool, then
whisk in the confectioner's sugar.

Clove flavor:  Add 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves with the confectioner's
sugar.

Lime or lemon flavor:  Use 1 tablespoon fresh lime or lemon juice in
place of the water and add 1/2 teaspoon grated lime or lemon zest
with the confectioner's sugar.
