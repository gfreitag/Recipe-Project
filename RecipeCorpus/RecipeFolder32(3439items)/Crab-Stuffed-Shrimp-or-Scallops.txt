Categories: Dress/stuff, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
24 ea Extra large shrimp per
-serving
1 c  Salad shrimp
2 c  Fresh bread crumbs
2 ea Beaten egg whites
4 tb Lemon juice
4 ea Chopped shallots
1/8 c  Chopped parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Butter or margarine, melted
Fresh lemon wedges
Peel and devain shrimp leaving on tail.  From the underside slice
down the shrimp slightly at the tail end and almost all the way
through at the thick end.  Put aside.  Mix salad shrimp, chopped
shallots, parsley, lemon juice and egg whites. Add bread crumbs until
its right.  Make into 24 balls all the same size and put one on each
shrimp at the large end. Place shrimp in broiling pan with any extra
stuffing put under the shrimp. Drizzle melted butter over all.  Place
under the broiler and check often. Time mostly depends on the size of
the shrimp and to overcook them would ruin the dish. Note:  Fresh Sea
Scallops can also be used.  But instead of stuffing them place the
stuffing balls under and around them in the pan. Serve with fresh
lemon wedges. Serves: 4
