Arrange the pheasant pieces in a single layer in a shallow dish.
Combine the orange rind, juice, onion, salt, mustard, pepper and
tabasco. Pour the mixture over the pheasant, marinate from one to
three hours. Drain remaining marinade for gravy.

Combine flour and paprika and coat the pheasant thoroughly with this
mixture. Save any leftover flour for gravy.

Brown pheasant in a large skillet containing a 112 inch of oil. Turn
often and brown on all sides. When pheasant is brown add one
tablespoon water and cover tightly, brown on all sides.

Uncover and continue cooking slowly until crisp. Remove pheasant to a
warm platter and prepare gravy. The gravy is made by taking a
tablespoon of butter, two tablespoons of flour and one cup of
marinade liquid, adding water as needed. Melt butter in the skillet
and stir in the flour, cook stirring constantly for about two
minutes. Gradually add the liquid and cook until the sauce thickens.
