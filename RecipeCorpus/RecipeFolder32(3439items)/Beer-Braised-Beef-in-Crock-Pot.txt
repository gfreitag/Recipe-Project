Title: Beer Braised Beef in Crock Pot
Categories: Meats, Crockpot
Yield: 6 servings
Ingredients:
3 lb Lean beef stew meat cut into
-1 1/2 inch pieces
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
2 md Onions thinly sliced
1    8 oz can mushrooms (or
-pieces) un-drained
1    12 oz can of beer
(I prefer a dark beer, and my favorite dark beer is Negro Modelo, a
Mexican beer) 1 Tbsp vinegar 2 beef bouillon cubes 2 tsp sugar 2
cloves garlic, minced 1 tsp thyme 2 bay leaves

Put the beef in the crock pot.  Combine all the other ingredients and
pour over the beef.  Cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-5
hours. Before serving thicken juices if desired.  Joyce says she uses
some flour or corn starch to do this.
