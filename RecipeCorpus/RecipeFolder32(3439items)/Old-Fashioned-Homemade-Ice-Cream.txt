Title: Old-Fashioned Homemade Ice Cream
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 6 quarts
2 ea Eggs, beaten well
4 tb Flour
2 1/2 tb Vanilla
3 c  Sugar (less for 5 qt freezer
Milk (about 1 gallon)
In saucepan, combine sugar and flour.  Stir well to break up any
lumps.  Add 2 to 3 cups milk and eggs.  Cook, stirring constantly,
until thick (usually until it comes to a boil).  Cool.  Add vanilla.
Pour into freezer and add enough milk to fill freezer 2/3 to 3/4
full. It usually takes our ice cream freezer from 25-40 minutes to
get the ice cream done.
This is a recipe we've used in our family since the 1950's.  I
hope you enjoy it as much as we have!
