Title: Greek Style Pizzettes
Categories: Breadmaker, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Water
1 ts Honey
1/2 ts Lemon rind -- grated
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Salt
2 3/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Yeast
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1/4    Stick unsalted butter
1/4 lb Spinach leaves -- rinsed and
Dried
14    Kalamata olives -- pitted &
Cut in half
1/2 c  Feta cheese -- crumbled
2 tb Parsley -- chopped
Salt and pepper
3 tb Olive oil
Place all ingredients in machine and program for knead and first rise.
Press start.  After the first 5 minutes of kneading the dough will be
firm and pull away from the sides of the machine.  While the dough is
rising you can prepare the toppings.  In a saute pan, heat the butter
over low heat and cook the spinach long enough for it to wilt, about
2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the garlic.  Set
the mixture aside while you assemble the pizzettes.  Preheat the oven
to 425 with the rack in the center position.  Lightly flour 2 baking
sheets and set them aside. When the dough is completed, transfer to a
lightly floured surface, cover it with a clean towel and let it rest
for 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 even pieces and roll each
piece out to a 6" circle. Transfer the circles to the prepared baking
sheet.  Distribute the spinach over the circles followed by the
olives and feta cheese. Sprinkle on the chopped parsley, salt and
pepper.  Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the top of each.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until the crust is deep golden brown and the
top is starting to brown.
