Butter a bowl and line with the roasted and chopped hazelnuts.

Mix caster sugar and butter, add egg yolks slowly. Add grated
chocolate and ground nuts.

Beat egg wthites until stiff and gently fold into mixture. Turn into
the lined bowl, cover with a double layer of greaseproof paper and
tie firmly with string. A double strip of kitchen foil laid under the
bowl and projecting up the sides will make lifting it out easier.

Place the bowl in a large saucepan 3/4-full of water and steam for 2
hours.

Carefully turn out on to a serving plate. Just before serving, pour
over some of the lightly whipped cream. Serve the remaining cream
separately. Submitted By RENE GAGNAUX   On   07-09-95
