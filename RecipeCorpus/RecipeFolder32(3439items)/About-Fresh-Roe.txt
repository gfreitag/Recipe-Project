Title: About Fresh Roe
Categories: Fish, Information
Yield: 1 text file  Roe can be broken out of its membrane and salted to create caviar or
cooked in a variety of ways. There will be two sacs in each fish.
Handle carefully to keep the membranes intact.

To poach: cover with boiling water. Add a dash of vinegar or lemon
juice and a pinch of salt. Simmer until firm, 5 to 10 minutes
depending on the size.

To broil: Dry the poached roe gently on a paper towel. Dredge in
flour, baste with melted butter and broil 3-4 minutes per side.

To fry[1]: Fry bacon and set aside. Blend an egg with 1 Tbl milk and
dip poached roe in the egg wash. Then dip in seasoned flour or crumbs
or in cornmeal. Fry in the bacon fat until browned. Serve with bacon
bits as a garnish.

To fry[2]: Dredge raw roe sacs in flour and sautee in sizzling garlic
flavored butter until thoroughly cooked and browned.

To fry[3]: Fry poached roes in butter with salt, pepper, lemon juice
and fine herbs [ parsley, tarragon, chervil and chives]. Serve with
pan juices dripped over the roes.

To cream: Simmer several roes, chopped onion, and chopped spinach or
sorrel in a covered skillet with 2 Tbls butter and 1 cup dry white
wine about 20 minutes. Remove the roes and add a cup of heavy cream;
reduce until thickened and serve over the roe. Season with salt and
pepper to taste.

To bake: Poach first and place in a baking dish. Smother with creole
or mushroom sauce and bake uncovered 15 minutes.

To serve: use as a hot hors d'oeuvre, on toast as a canape, as a
between course savory, as a garnish for fish dishes or in larger
quantities as a light luncheon entree.
