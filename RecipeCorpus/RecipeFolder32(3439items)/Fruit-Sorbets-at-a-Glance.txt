Sugar Content in Selected Fruits

The sugar content in fresh fruit differs according to the specific
variety (some apples are naturally sweeter than others) and ripeness
(ripe fruit contains more sugar than unripe fruit). Below is a list
of the average sugar content in some common fruits based on figures
in Harold McGee's The Curious Cook. To make sorbets with fruits not
listed in the chart above, find a fruit in the chart with a
corresponding sugar level and acidity and replace one fruit with the
other.

Blackberry
Blueberry
Cantaloupe
