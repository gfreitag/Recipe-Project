Categories: Pie/tart, Guestchefs
Yield: 2 servings
2 c  Unbleached all-purpose

6 1/2 tb Cold unsalted butter
3 tb Vegetable shortening

This is a good basic pie crust recipe from Lindsey Shere at Chez
Panisse. It is flaky and has a good butter flavor.

MIX THE FLOUR, SALT AND SUGAR in a bowl. Cut the salted butter in
pieces 1/3-inch thick and quickly cut them into the flour mixture
until it is the texture of cornmeal. You can do this with a pastry
blender, with your hands by rubbing quickly and lightly Cut in the
unsalted butter and the vegetable shortening until they are in larger
pieces, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch in diameter. This helps to make the
dough flaky. Sprinkle in the 3 tablespoons ice water, tossing the
dough lightly with a fork to moisten it e During this time, the
enzymes in the flour will mellow the gluten to permit the water to be
absorbed completely; this conditioning will help to prevent shrinkage
and toughness later. Makes enough for two 9-inch pie shells.
