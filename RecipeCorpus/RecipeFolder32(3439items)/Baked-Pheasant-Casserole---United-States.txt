Coat pheasant pieces in flour mixture with seasonings. Brown quickly
in a half inch of oil. Remove meat from pan. Make gravy using
drippings in a pan plus bacon fat, seasoned flour and cream. Thin
with milk if necessary. Stir in vegetables and simmer. Place meat in
a deep casserole, breast first, meatside down. Liquid should fill
casserole two- thirds full after gravy has been added. Add milk if
needed. Cover and bake at 350 oven for about two hours.
