Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2    Ducks or 1 Goose
Lard or shortening
Flour
Water
Salt
Pepper
1 sm Apple, quartered
1    Potato, chunked
1    Onion, quartered

Lightly salt and pepper inside of bird(s). Roll in flour to coat.
Slowly brown bird on all sides. Remove bird to Dutch oven. Add flour
to pan drippings. Cook and stir until brown. Add water, salt, and
pepper. Cook and stir until thickened. I usually make 4-5 cups of
gravy.

Stuff cavities with apple, onion, and chunked potato. Put potatoes and
onions around bird. Pour gravy over all. Cover. Bake slowly 3 1/2 - 4
hours or until the meat is falling off the bones -- tender and moist.
Serve 1/2 duck to each person or slice goose. Pass potatoes, onions
and gravy.
