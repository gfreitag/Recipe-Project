Categories: Ussr, Soup/stew, Meats, Ethnic
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Boneless lean lamb
; cut in 1" cubes
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
; to taste
3 tb Butter
1 md Onion, finely chopped
4 c  Beef broth
1 md Potato, peeled and cubed
1 sm Quince
; peeled, cored, and cubed
1/2 c  Dried pitted prunes
OR 1 c fresh sour prunes
1/4 lb Chestnuts, shelled & peeled
2/3 c  Canned chick-peas*
; drained & rinsed
2 tb Clarified butter
Season the lamb with salt and pepper.  In a heavy pot, melt the 3 tb.
butter over moderate heat.  Add the lamb and onion; saute until
browned, stirring frequently.  Add the broth; season to taste with
salt. Cover; simmer 30 minutes. Add the potato, quince, prunes, and
chestnuts. Cover; simmer 20 minutes. Add the chick-peas and simmer,
covered, about 15 minutes or until done. Stir in the clarified butter
and allow to melt before serving soup. Note: 1/4 tsp. ginger or a
pinch of powdered saffron dissolved in 2 tb. warm water may be added
with the chick-peas, and the soup served sprinkled with 1 ts. crushed
dried mint, accompanied by chopped onion and sumakh on the side. In
the Caucasus, ground kyurdyuk is normally used instead of the
clarified butter, and dried chick-peas* rather than canned ones.  The
dried chick-peas are soaked several hours, drained, and added at the
beginning with the broth. Note: Sumakh (labelled as sumac, a spice
mixture) at Middle Eastern groceries. Submitted By DON HOUSTON   On
