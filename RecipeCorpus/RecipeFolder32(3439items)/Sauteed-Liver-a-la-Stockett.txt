Title: Sauteed Liver a la Stockett
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Calf or baby beef liver
1 lg Mild onion
Flour for dredging
Salt & pepper
Oil for cooking
Stock- beef or chicken - opt
Heat and iron skillet over medium heat.  Add a little oil and heat.
Meanwhile, peel onions and cut into THIN slices.  Place in oil and
saute slowly until onions are light brown and beginning to
caramelize. Remove onions from skillet.  Add a little more oil to
skillet if necessary. Dredge liver - should be sliced thinly -
lightly in flour and season with salt and pepper.  Turn skillet heat
to high, and sautee liver until crisply brown on outside and still
slightly pink (yes, medium rare!) on the inside. Turn liver slices a
couple of times while cooking and regulate heat so meat doesn't
scorch. Return onions to skillet briefly to reheat. A little stock
(chicken or beef) may be used to deglaze the pan and create a
flavorful gravy;  but don't simmer the liver past medium rare lest it
become tough. Serve immediately, with roasted or mashed potatoes and
a green vegetable. Submitted By RICHARD DOUVILLE   On   07-14-95
