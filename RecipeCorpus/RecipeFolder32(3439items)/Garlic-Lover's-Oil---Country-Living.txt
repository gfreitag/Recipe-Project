Title: Garlic-Lover's Oil - Country Living
Categories: Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------YIELD: 1 1-LITER BOTTLE-----------------------
1 lg Head garlic
3 3/4 c  Vegetable oil or light olive
-oil
Garlic-chive flowers (opt.)
1 ea Separate garlic into
-individual cloves,
-reserving 4 or 5 cloves.
Lightly crush remaining garlic cloves; peel and coarsely chop them.
2. In large jar, place crushed garlic and cover with oil; seal
tightly. Store in the refrigerator a week to 10 days. 3. Strain the
garlic-flavored oil and pour into a 1-liter bottle. Peel reserved
garlic cloves and thread onto a long wooden skewer. Insert skewer
into bottle along with garlic-chive flowers, if desired. Seal and
store bottle in the refrigerator. Ideal for stir-frying, this
garlic-infused oil should always be kept refrigerated in the coldest
part of the refrigerator (38' F) to reduce the risk of botulism.
Unrefrigerated garlic-in-oil mixes can permit the growth of
Clostridium butulinum bacteria, a toxin that does not affect the
taste or smell of the oil. Spores of this bacteria are commonly found
in the environment and sometimes on produce such as garlic. These
spores are harmless when there is oxygen present. But, when
spore-containing garlic is bottled and covered with oil, an
oxygen-free environment is created that promotes the germination of
the spores with subsequent toxin production resulting at temperatures
of 50'F or above. Country Living/Sept/90 Scanned & fixed by DP & GG
