1.  Wash and prepare the seafood.  But the fish fillets into
bite-sized pieces.  Scrub the mussels and remove the beards.  Take
the limbs off the crab and crack the shell with a hammer so the meat
is easy to remove at the table.  Remove the outer shell, c 2. Put the
garlic, chilies, and cilantro root in a blender and make a coarse
paste. Put to one side. 3. Heat the oil and fry the garlic, chili and
cilantro over medium heat. Add the seafood and stir-fry gently so the
fish fillet does not break up. Add the oyster sauce and NuocMam
sauce.  Taste, cover and simmer for a few minutes. 4. Remove the lid
and add the sweet bell pepper, onion, shallots, and mint, and
stir-fry gently (the fish fillets are now even more delicate) for a
couple of minutes then remove from the heat. 5. Arrange on a large,
shallow serving dish and garnish with whatever herbs you happen to
have around. Serve with a large bowl of steaming rice.
