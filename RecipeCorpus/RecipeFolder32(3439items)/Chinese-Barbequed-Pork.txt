Trim any fat off the tenderloins; tuck ends under and tie each with

TO PREPARE THE MARINADE:  Whisk together the soy sauce, hoisin sauce,
sherry, blackbean sauce, gingeroot, sugar, garlic, sesame oil, and
five-spice  powder.

Pour the marinade over tenderloins and turn to coat.  Cover and
refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours; turn
occasionally. Let stand for 30 minutes at room temp before cooking.

Place tenderloins on rack in roasting pan, reserving marinade.  Pour
1 cup water into pan.  Bake, basting generously four times, in a
preheated, 375 degree F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a meat
thermometer inserted at 20 degree angle registers 160 degree F. and
the meat still has a hint of pink.

Remove to a cutting board, and tent with foil.  Let stand for 10
minutes.

Remove the string.  Using a sharp knife, slice the pork diagonally
into thin slices.

Makes 6 servings.
