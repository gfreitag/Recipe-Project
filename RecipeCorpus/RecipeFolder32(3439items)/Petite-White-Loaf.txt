Holiday Baking Book and the forthcoming Light Muffins (Clarkson N.
Potter).

This makes a perfect little loaf, 4-3/4 inches square and almost 5
inches high. When you've mastered this loaf, double the ingredients
for a good Basic White Bread. It tastes great hot with butter and
jam, and it toasts well, too, if you happen to have any left over.

Measure the ingredients into the container for the bread machine in
the order given. (Reverse the order in machines which call for adding
the liquids last of all.) Select the basic or rapid bread cycle and
the medium setting for the crust. Press the start button or program
the machine for delayed start if desired, and press start.
