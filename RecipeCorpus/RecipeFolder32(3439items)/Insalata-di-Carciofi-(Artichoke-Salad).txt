-artichokes
3 tb Olive oil
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1    Bay leaf
1/2    Lemon, sliced razor thin

1. Trim the artichokes of tough leaves, spines and ragged stem ends.
Heat the regular olive oil in a heavy skillet that can be covered.
Saute the garlic and remove. Place the artichokes in bottom-side down
and cook over low heat for ten minutes. Add the bay leaf and a half
cup of water, bring to boil, reduce heat to simmering, cover and cook
for 15 to 20 minutes or until artichokes are just tender on the
inside.

2. When the artichokes are cool enough to handle comfortably, peel
off the leaves and reserve. Remove the hairy choke and discard. If
the bottoms are large, slice them in halves, or quarters. If small,
leave them whole. Toss with the lemon juice.

3. Scrape the succulent meat from the bottom part of the larger
leaves and place in a bowl with the olive oil, 2/3rds of the parsley,
salt and pepper to taste. Mix well, until bound. You may use an
electric mixer on this.

4. Pour over the artichoke bottoms and lemon juice, gently mixing
with a big wooden spoon. Arrange on a platter with lemon slices,
sprinkle with minced onion, olives and more parsley. Toss before
serving. Serve at room temperature with good crusty bread.
