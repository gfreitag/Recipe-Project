Title: Deep Dish Peach Cobbler
Categories: Fruit, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
16 oz Can sliced peaches in syrup
1 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Granulated sugar
2 ts Cornstarch
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 c  Baking mix
2 tb Milk (to 3)
Frozen vanilla yogurt; opt
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Drain peaches and measure syrup, adding
water if necessary to make 2/3 cup; set syrup mixture aside. Turn
peaches into 1 quart casserole and drizzle with lemon juice; set
aside.

In a 1 quart saucepan, stir together sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon
until free of lumps; whisk in peach juice and bring to a boil over
medium heat, stirring often. When syrup comes to a simmer and is
slightly thickened, pour over peaches and set aside while you make
drip biscuits.

In a small bowl, stir together baking mix and milk just to blend.
Divide in half and spoon over peaches to make 2 drop biscuits. Bake
20 minutes, or until topping is browned and peaches are bubbling.
Serve warm or cold with frozen vanilla yogurt if desired.
