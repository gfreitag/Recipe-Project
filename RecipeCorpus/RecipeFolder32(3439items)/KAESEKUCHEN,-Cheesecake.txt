The cheesecake you are referring to is quarkkuchen. To the best of my
knowledge, the closest thing to "quark" would be pureed or strained
cottage cheese.
Here's a recipe for you. Prepare dough and with it line bottom and
sides of a greased cake tin. Strain cottage cheese, stir in cream.
Add sugar, eggs, grated lemon peel, vanilla, raisins and cornstarch.
Mix flour and baking soda and add. Pour batter into dough lining, top
with grated almonds and bake in 375F oven for about 1 hour.  When
done, cool cake in a warm place.  Do not chill. CRUST; Mix all
ingredients and, on a bread board, knead to a supple dough.  Roll out
and use as instructed in above recipe. In view of the large butter
content of this dough, it should be thoroughly cooled before baking.
