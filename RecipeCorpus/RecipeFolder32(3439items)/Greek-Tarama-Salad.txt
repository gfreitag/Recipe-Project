Title: Greek Tarama Salad
Categories: Greek, Salads, Appetizers, Dips/spread
Yield: 8 servings
3 tb Tarama [Carp Roe]
2 tb Lemon juice

In a mixer or blender, blend on low the tarama and lemon juice. Trim
the crusts from the bread, soak the bread in water, and squeeze out
the excess water. Break the bread into the mixture and blend on

thicken like mayonnaise. Serve as a dip with raw vegetables and
