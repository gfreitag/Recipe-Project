Yield: 1 servings
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Frozen lard or shortening --
Cut into bits
3 tb Ice water
To ensure a tender crust, this recipe should not be doubled.
Thoroughly freezing the lard or shortening will give you the flakiest
crust.

PLACE THE FLOUR AND SALT in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2-3
times. Scatter the lard or shortening over the flour mixture.
Sprinkle with the water and process about 5 seconds or until dough
just begins to form. Shape into a ball, then flatten it

Yield: 1 single-crust 8- to 10-inch pie shell.
