Wash cranberries and pick out the ones that are soft or blemished.

Beat together the milk, eggs, cream cheese, a little nutmeg and a
dash of salt.  Stir in the cooked vegetable mixture and pour this
filling carefully into the prepared shell.  Bake at 375 degrees F.
for 40 minutes or until the top is golden and firm. Serve.

NOTES:

*  Sweet potatoes, carrots and cranberries in cream cheese quiche --
This recipe has become a real holiday favorite in our family.  It is
originally from "The Vegetarian Epicure, Book Two" by Anna Thomas.
It is sweeter than most quiches, but not as sweet as most pies, and
can be eaten either as a side dish, or as dessert. We usually eat it
with the turkey because no one wants to wait until dessert time!

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  25 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
