banana mixture and beat well. Continue beating and add all the
chocolate mixture.

Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Quickly, but

completely set and firm.

Carefully loosen the sides of the mousse cake with a warmed metal

off the base of the tin onto a serving plate. Whip the remaining
cream until it is thick and pipe a decorative border on the mousse
cake. Sprinkle with chocolate curls and chill well before serving.
