Soup
2 c  Milk
1    Onion, grated or chopped
-fine
2    7 oz cans green chili salsa
1 lb Cheddar cheese, grated
1    Cube chicken bouillon
1 c  Boiling water
Place chicken breasts in buttered baking dish - brush with melted
butter; salt and pepper.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.

Bone, skin and cut chicken into bite-size pieces; set aside.  Cut
tortillas lengthwise into 1" strips; set aside. In a separate bowl,
combine soups, milk, onion and chili salsa; mix well.

In a small bowl, dissolve bouillon cube in 1 cup boiling water.  Place
about 3 Tbsp. of this bouillon over bottom of a buttered 3-qt.
casserole (throw rest of bouillon away). Place one half of the
tortilla strips in the bottom of the casserole, 1/3 of the chicken,
half of the soup mixture, remaining tortillas, remaining chicken and
sauce. Top whole thing with grated cheese. Cover and refrigerate for
at least 24 hours.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees and bake for 1 1/2 hours or until heated
through.

Note:  I usually boil the chicken for about 45-60 minutes instead of
baking it.  This renders a moister chicken and it's easy to skin
after boiling. Mom used to serve this popular dish to company along
with her Herb Bread and a green salad with her French Dressing. -
