Prepare the chipotle mayonnaise and set aside. Peel the roasted
chiles, then split them down the center and remove the seeds.

Divide the ground beef into 16 portions and make patties. Season each
patty with salt, pepper and chile powder, and brush with olive oil.
Using two patties for each burger, place half a peeled green chile
and cup shredded cheese between the patties and press them firmly to
seal in the "filling" completely.

Grill the burgers to desired degree. Serve in hamburger buns with
chipotle mayonnaise garnished with slices of tomato, red onion and
avocado.
