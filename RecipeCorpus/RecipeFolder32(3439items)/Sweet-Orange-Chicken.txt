Title: Sweet Orange Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 recipe
1    Whole chicken
1 cn Frozen orange juice
3/4 cn Water
Thyme
Sweet basil
Garlic powder
Black pepper
Allow the frozen orange juice to thaw and mix the concentrate with the
water.

Wash the chicken thoroughly under running warm water.  This will
loosen the skin.  Separate the skin from the meat by separating the
skin under water throughout the chicken by allowing the water to
expand the skin. Prevent the water from running out the tail or neck
portions by closing them up with your hand.  Allow to drain and rest.

Take the frozen juice mixture and pour into the pocket formed by the
loosened skin, making sure you cover the entire chicken under the
skin. Allow to drain into a separate bowl or cup for reuse.

Sprinkle the thyme, basil, garlic powder, and pepper into the same
cavity created by the separation of the skin from meat.

In a metal bowl or  pan, place the chicken and cook in the oven or on
the grill.  Halfway through the the cooking process, about 20 to 30
minutes, pour the remaining orange juice over the top of the chicken.
This step can be repeated as necessary to promote a golden glaze.

Allow the chicken to cool slightly, about 10 minutes, slice and serve.
