Title: Home-Smoked Salmon
Categories: Fish, Bbq/grill
Yield: 8 servings
1 lb Salmon fillets or steaks
Alderwood chips
Chimney Smoker
This is a method rather than a recipe.  The key is to use alderwood, a
hardwood found in the Pacific Northwest, as the smoking wood.  It is
my understanding that in the PacNW, smokehouses and seafood grills
use GREEN alder twigs, but such things aren't available on the East
Coast.

Ready a chimney smoker (I made one out of a galvanized trashcan
several years ago, but they are currently cheaper to buy than to
make!) with a small amount of coals while soaking the alderwood
chips. When the coals are glowing hot, drain the water from the
chips, place the chips on the hot coals, get the drip catcher and the
grate in place, and put the salmon directly on the grate.  Close the
lid and leave it alone for 6 to 12 hours! The fish will cook at 130
to 140 degrees, and will probably flake when removed from the grate.
This is of a different flavor and consistency than your normal
perception of smoked salmon. The fish may be served directly in small
dishes with a fresh lemon wedge and a quality toast as an appetizer,
or it can be mixed with a little cream cheese, sour cream, and lemon
juice as a spread.  Use your imagination!!!
