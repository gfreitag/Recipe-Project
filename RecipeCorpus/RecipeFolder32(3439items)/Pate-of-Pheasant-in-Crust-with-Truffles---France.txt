Make a pate dough by putting the flour on a large piece of wax paper,
make an indentation in the center, add the teaspoon of salt, six
eggs, butter and the water. Work this dough with hands until it is of
rolling consistency.

To make the pate, cut the breasts in slices the size of french fried
potatoes. Marinate overnight in the cognac, salt, pepper, sage,
allspice and any other spice you would like to use.

Grind the pork shoulder and the legs of the pheasants with the bone
removed, using the finest blade of the food grinder. Add the rest of
the eggs and marinade.

Line the bottom and sides of a casserole, fourteen inches long, four
inches wide and four inches deep with one quarter inch of dough. Make
layers of the pork and the pheasant to the halfway mark of the
casserole. In the center make a roll of truffles, and keep rotating
pork and pheasant, finishing with the pork. Cover the dish with the
remaining dough making little holes in the top to let the steam out.
Cook in a preheated 350 oven for three hours. This recipe makes
twenty five servings.
