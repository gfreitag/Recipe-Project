Cake:  Sift flour once, measure, add baking powder, and sift together
three times.  Cream shortening thoroughly, add sugar gradually, and
cream together until light and fluffy.  Add flour, alternately with
milk, a small amount at a time.  Beat after each addition until
smooth. Add vanilla. Fold in egg whites.  Bake in two greased 9"
layer pans in a 375 F. oven 25 to 30 minutes.  Put layers together
with Orange Filling and cover top and sides of cake with Seven Minute
Frosting. Decorate with mandarin orange sections. Filling: Combine
ingredients in order given. Cook in a double boiler ten minutes,
stirring constantly. Cool. Frosting: Put egg whites, sugar, water,
corn syrup, and salt in top of double boiler and mix thoroughly.
Place over rapidly boiling water and beat constantly with a rotary
egg beater until the mixture will hold a peak (about seven minutes).
Remove from hot water, add vanilla and marshmallows and beat until
cool and thick enough to spread.
