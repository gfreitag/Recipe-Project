Title: Dill Pickles
Categories: Jewish, Pickles
Yield: 1 servings
30    Cucumbers
1/2 c  Coarse salt
2 qt Water
2 tb Vinegar
4    Garlic cloves
4    Bay leaves
1/4 ts Mustard seed
1 ts Mixed pickling spice
10    Sprigs Dill
Buy even-sized cucumbers and be sure they are very firm. Wash and dry
them. Arrange the cucumbers in a crock or jar. Bring the salt and
water to a boil.  Cool; then add the vinegar, garlic, bay leaves,
mustard seed and pickling spice.  Pour over the cucumbers. Arrange
the dill over all. The liquid should completely cover the cucumbers;
if not, add more salted water.  If crock is used, cover with a plate
or wooden board to weight it down.  Loosely cover with cheesecloth.
Keep in a cool place for a week. If you like very green pickles, you
might test one at the end of 5 days. Recipe Source: THE ART OF JEWISH
