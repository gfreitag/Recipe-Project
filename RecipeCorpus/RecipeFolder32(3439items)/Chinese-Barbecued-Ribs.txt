PREPARATION: -Trim excess fat from ribs. -Place ribs in long; shallow
pan. -Mix marinade.  Pour over ribs.  Baste thoroughly. -Marinate at
least 3 hours at room temperature or 6 hours in refrigerator.
Overnight is OK. Turn regularly. COOKING: -Put large shallow pan of
water on bottom of oven. -Pre-heat oven to 375F. -As if hanging a
hammock, suspend ribs from the uppermost rack of oven. -Roast
undisturbed for 45 minutes. -Raise temperature to 450F. Roast 15
minutes longer or until crisp and deep golden brown. -Cut into
individual ribs. >>> You might want to check the ribs after the first
45 minutes and see how well done they are. Depending on the size of
the ribs, sometimes the extra 15 minutes isn't necessary, or not at
450.
