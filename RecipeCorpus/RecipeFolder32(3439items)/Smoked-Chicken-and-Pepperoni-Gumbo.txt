SMOKED CHICKEN and PEPPERONI GUMBO

VEGETABLES: Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut rest in
fine chop (or use food processor).

MEATS: Debone chicken breasts, skin and pull into bite size pieces by
hand. If you do not have smoked chicken, you may get away with using a
small amount of liquid smoke.  I would guess no more than 1/4
teaspoon. Cut pepperoni into moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch
or about twice as thick as presliced pizza pepperoni usually is).

Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and singe them
over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes, stirring
constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for about 5
minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add spice
mixture and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry roux.
Add the broth and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to medium low
and simmer for at least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are tender and
flavors are merged. About 5 minutes before serving, add the chunks of
chicken breasts to the mixture. At the same time, add more roux to
thicken if desired.

Serve in bowl over lots of rice.

For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese
cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni.
Remove all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken
pieces. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
