Title: Spicy BBQ Shrimp
Categories: Hot/spicy, Fish, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Butter, or margarine
3/4 c  Bottled hickory flavored
-BBQ
Sauce, or substitute your
, own favorite sauce
2 tb Lemon juice
2 lb Medium to large shrimp
, unshelled
1/2 c  Dry Sherry
Cayenne pepper
Black pepper
Garlic Powder
Instructions:

1. Turn on broiler and melt butter in a 13x9-inch broiler pan, or
other broiler-proof dish.

2. Remove pan from oven and stir in BBQ sauce and lemon juice.

3. Add shrimp and toss to coat. Spread out in pan.

4. Sprinkle cayenne pepper, black pepper and garlic powder GENEROUSLY
over the shrimp, remembering that the shell is on the shrimp and not
all seasoning will be absorbed!

5. Broil five inches from the heat source for four minutes. Turn
shrimp. Add sherry and broil for four minutes longer.

6. Let stand for a few minutes to absorb the spices (my dad's astute
addition)

7. Makes 4-6 servings, depending on your "hearty" appetite. I serve
it with boiled potatoes in butter and parsley and some other veggie,
depending on the season.

8. Don't have too much wine while making this. I did one time and
ended up with little fireballs that were even too spicy for me
(amazing, but true!!)

WARNING: This is a WONDERFULLY addictive recipe and VERY VERY VERY
messy, as you have to peel the shrimp when done. NO white shirts or
pants allowed (although SOME kind would be appropriate ;-) ) Enjoy!
I've seen lots of requests for spicy food. My dad got this recipe out
of the State Times in Baton Rouge about 6 years ago. The
author/creator/goddess is Lynn Greeson Mitchell. It's VERY easy and
quick.
