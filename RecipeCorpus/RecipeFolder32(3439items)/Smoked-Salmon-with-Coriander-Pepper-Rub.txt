Spice (Harvard Common Press, 1994), a guide to cooking with smoke.

1. Rub each salmon fillet with 3/4 teaspoon spice rub, then sprinkle
with salt. Let rubbed salmon stand, loosely covered, at room
temperature for 30 minutes. (Can be covered and refrigerated
overnight if fish is fresh.)

2. Following instructions for grill or smoker setup (see "How To
Smoke-Cook with a Kettle-Style Grill" or "How To Smoke-Cook with a
Water Smoker," page 19), soak wood chunks and set up grill or smoker.

3. Smoke salmon until just opaque, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve. Source:
