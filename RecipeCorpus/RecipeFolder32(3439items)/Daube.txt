Categories: Meats, Pasta, Tomatoes
Yield: 6 servings
4 lb To 5 lb beef chuck roast
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1/2 c  Chopped green pepper
1    To 2 cloves garlic
8 oz Can tomato paste
8 oz Can tomato sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
4    Or 5 carrots
Tried this recipe the other day.  I prefer a little more tomatoe-y
sauce for spaghetti, but I thought the meat was divine. I omitted the
carrots, just because I forgot them.  @:-)

On the butcher's recommendation, I used a center cut chuck roast
(which was 10 cents more a pound than blade cut).  Cut the bones off
before cooking and have them stashed in the freezer for veggie soup
later this winter.

I made this in my cast iron Dutch oven.

Sear roast in heated olive oil.  remove from pan and andd onions,
green pepper, and garlic.  Fry until soft but now brown.  Add tomato
paste and sauce.  Stir and cook about 5 minutes.  (MY NOTE: I've read
elsewhere that this allows the sugar in the tomato porducts to
crystalize, sweetening the sauce.)  Add meat, salt, and pepper. Add
water to cover roast. Simmer about 5 hours.

Thirty minutes before serving, add carrots. Serve with spaghetti.
