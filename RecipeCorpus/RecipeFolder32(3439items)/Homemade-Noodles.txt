Title: Homemade Noodles
Categories: Jewish, Pasta
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Flour
2    Eggs
1 tb Water
1/2 ts Salt
Place unsifted flour on a board and make a well in the center.  Drop
eggs, water and salt into it.  Work into the flour with one hand and
knead until smooth and elastic. Roll and stretch the dough as thin as
possible.  The thinner it is, the better the noodles. Let the rolled
dough stand until it feels dry to the touch, but don't let it get too
dry. You can cut the dough into squares, strips or very narrow
noodles.  For narrow ones, roll up like a jelly roll and slice as
thin as balance in tightly closed jars. Recipe Source: THE ART OF
