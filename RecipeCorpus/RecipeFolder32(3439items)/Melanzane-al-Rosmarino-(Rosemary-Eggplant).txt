Categories: Vegetables, Italian, Herbs/spice, Nuts/grains
Yield: 6 servings
3    Cleaned, peeled medium-sized
-eggplant
(about 2 pounds) cut into
-1-1/2" cubes
3 tb Rosemary leaves, fresh
Or preserved in salt
4 lg Cloves garlic, peeled
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
3/4 c  Olive oil
10    To 12 slices of crusty
-Italian bread without
-sesame seeds,
About 1-inch thick, lightly
-coated with olive oil
20    Sprigs Italian parsley
1. Place the eggplant on a serving platter, sprinkle about 2
tablespoons coarse salt over, then place a second platter over the
eggplant as a weight, but do not crush them. Let rest for at least 1
hour.

Meanwhile, finely chop rosemary and garlic together on a board.
Transfer to a small bowl, add salt and pepper to taste and mix very
well.

3. Rinse the eggplant many times under cold running water, then pat
dry with paper towels.

4. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is
moderately hot, about 300-F, add the eggplant, preferably in one
layer, and cook uncovered for 3 or 4 minutes. By that time the lower
part of the eggplant should have a thin, golden crust. Turn the
eggplant over, cover skillet and cook for 3 or 4 minutes more.

5. Sprinkle with the rosemary mixture all over the eggplant and mix
very well with a wooden spoon. Some cubes of the vegetable may fall
apart; this is all right. Keep cooking until all the cubes are soft.
With a skimmer, transfer the eggplant to a crockery or glass bowl.
Discard all the remaining oil in the skillet.

6. Add the parsley leaves to the eggplant and mix again. Immediately
place some of the eggplant mixture over the slices of bread and
serve. This dish may be served as an appetizer or a vegetable, but
always warm.
