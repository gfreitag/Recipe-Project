Title: Jello Fruit Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Sugar
3 1/2 tb . Jello
Flavor of fruit.
Baked Pie Shell
2 1/2 tb . Cornstarch
1 c  Water
Whipped Creme
4 c  Fruit (frozen is alright)
Combine sugar, cornstarch and water in heavy saucepan,  Cook at
medium heat until thick and fairly clear.  Remove from heat and add
Jello Mix. Stir until  dissolved.  Stir in fruit, pour in shell and
chill. Serve with whipped cream

**Use all of a small package of Jello with a little more juice or
water and fill  2 small crusts.

My notes.......  I mostly use a ready made chocolate graham shell for
this. Then I set all the berries in the shell so they all stand up.
I pour the boiled mix over it.  If it doesn't look thick I add more
cornstarch and cook until it clears.  And you can use any type fruit
that has a jello flavor to match.
