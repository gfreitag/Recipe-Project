Grandma's Rice Pudding (Susan Barrington)

This is from my grandma and it's the only rice pudding recipe she ever
used.  Now it's the only rice pudding recipe I ever use!

Nutmeg

Use 1 egg per c of milk and 1 Tbsp sugar or honey per c of milk. Add
1/2 c raisins per egg.  Stir in 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Add 1/3 c cooked
rice per c of milk.  Mix well and sprinkle with nutmeg. Set pan in
hot water. Bake at 325 degrees for 45 - 60 minutes.

This is incredibly easy and ALWAYS turns out!

From Marge Clark:

Rice Light cream Raisins Brown sugar

I had forgotten one of my favorite desserts when I was growing up. If
there was leftover rice, my mother would throw it in the top of the
double boiler, add some light cream, a double handful of raisins, and
a scoop of brown sugar, let it heat up all during dinner.

oooooh that was good stuff!
