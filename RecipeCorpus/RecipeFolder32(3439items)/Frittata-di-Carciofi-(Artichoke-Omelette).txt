Title: Frittata di Carciofi (Artichoke Omelette)
Categories: Vegetables, Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
4    Artichokes
1    Lemon
2 tb Minced Italian parsley
1/2 md Onion minced
2 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
Six eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons water Salt Freshly ground black
pepper

1. Remove tough outer leaves of the artichokes, slice in very thin
slices, lengthwise and place in a bowl with lemon juice for 1/2 hour.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy skillet and cook onion until
translucent, then remove. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat to
medium.

3. Drain the artichokes and pat dry. Slip them into the hot oil
carefully. Cook, browning slightly, until they are tender. Remove,
drain on paper, salt and pepper them.

4. Pre-heat the broiler. Wipe the skillet out so that no hardened
particles remain. Put in the remaining butter and oil, heat to
medium, add half the egg mixture, arrange the artichokes on top,
sprinkle with the onion and parsley, then the rest of the eggs. Cook
until the bottom is just set. Run under the broiler to barely brown
the top. If you like, you may dust with a little Pecorino cheese
before running under the broiler. Serve hot, warm, or at room
temperature. This also is delicious on a sandwich, or with a salad on
the side.
