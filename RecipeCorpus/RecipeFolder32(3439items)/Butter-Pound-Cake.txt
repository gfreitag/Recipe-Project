Title: Butter Pound Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 8 servings
3 lg Eggs -- at room temperature
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  Cake flour
3/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Unsalted butter -- at room
Temperature
3/4 c  Sugar
Preheat oven to 350~. Put rack in middle of oven. Butter and flour an
8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together
the eggs and vanilla extract until blended. In a small bowl, sift
together flour, baking powder and salt. In a large bowl, using an
electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat the butter until light.
Gradually add the sugar, beating until fluffy and ivory colored.
Gradually beat in egg mixture until well mixed. Reduce speed to low
and gradually beat in flour mixture, occasionally scraping down the
sides of the bowl, just until combined. Do not overmix. Transfer
batter to prepared pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake
until top is deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into center
comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let
cool in pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto rack, turn right-side up and
let cool completely. Makes 1 loaf cake.

Note:  Cake can be stored in a lock-top plastic bag at room
temperature for up to 2 days.
