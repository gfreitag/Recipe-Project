Title: Sweet Potato Chips~
Categories: Healthy, Potatoes
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 lb Sweet potatoes
1/2 tb Corn oil
1.  Preheat oven to 400 F.  Lightly coat a baking sheet with non-stick
cooking spray.

2. Slice the sweet potatoes by hand in very thin slices, or use a food
processor with a 2-millimeter disk.

3. In a large bowl carefully toss the sweet potato slices by hand in
the oil to coat the chips lightly. Lay the slices in a single layer
in the prepared baking pan.

4. Bake the chips for 15 minutes.  Turn each piece over with a metal
spatula and bake for 5 more minutes.  Chips should be dry and slightly
crisp. If not, bake up to 3 more minutes, checking every minute so the
chips won't burn. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
