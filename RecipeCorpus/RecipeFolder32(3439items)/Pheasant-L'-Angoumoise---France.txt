Season to taste

Stuff the pheasant with pork fat which has been rubbed through a
sieve. Truffles and chestnuts should be cooked in consomme. This
preparation should be seasoned, ought to be cold when stuffed into
the pheasant. Wrap the bird with the slices of bacon. Roast in a
preheated 350 oven for forty five minutes and take care to remove the
bacon slices seven or eight minutes before the cooking is completed
so that the outside of the pheasant can brown. Set on a platter and
serve with periqueux sauce.
