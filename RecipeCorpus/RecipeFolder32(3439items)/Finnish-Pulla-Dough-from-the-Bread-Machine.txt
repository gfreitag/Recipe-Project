MAKES 1 LOAF

Measure all of the ingredients, except those for the glaze, into the
container of bread machine in the order given. (Reverse the order in
machines which call for adding the liquids last of all.)

Set the machine to the "dough" cycle. Press start.

When the dough is complete, remove from the pan and turn out onto a
lightly oiled work surface. Cut into 3 parts and roll each part into
strands about 20 inches long.

Braid the strands and place on a greased or parchment covered baking
sheet. Cover and let rise until puffy, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375-F. Brush the braid with the egg beaten with
the milk and sprinkle with the almonds and/or pearl sugar. Bake for
20 to 23 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the loaf comes out
clean and dry. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.
