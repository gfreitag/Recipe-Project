Title: Cranberry Meatballs
Categories: Meats, Fruit, Crockpot, Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------FROM: CINDY TARSI--------------------------
Take 1 can each whole and
-crushed cranberry sauce
-and 8 oz tomato sauce.  Put
-all in a dutch oven and
-heat.
Combine 1 lb ground beef
-with 1 egg and enough
-bread crumbs so that the
-meatballs will hold
-together firmly.  (I used
-about 1/2 cup, I think it
-needed a little more).
You should be able to get
-about 25 meatballs to the
-pound (She swears she has
-this down to a science).
When she showed me, I got
-26.  I always was an
-overachiever ++ Grin!)
Chop up 1 small or medium
-onion (about 1/2 - 1 cup)
Heat some oil (enough to
-cover bottom of frying pan,
-or less, as desired and
-depending on the pan).
Begin to brown the onions
-in the pan.  Add as many
-meatballs as will
"comfortably" fit; brown
-meatballs.  When meatballs
-are browned, add to
-cranberry mixture.  Add
-more oil as necessary and
-continue adding/browning
-meatballs until all are
-brown and put in cranberry
-mix.  Remaining browned
-onions, drained, may be
-added, as well.
Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes or until thoroughly
cooked/heated through.  Serve, preferably with lots of bread for
dipping available. Family favorites for dipping are hard-crusted,
Jewish rye bread or challah.
