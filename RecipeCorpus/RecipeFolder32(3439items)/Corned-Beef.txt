When cool, pour over:
This salted beef actually has nothing to do with corn but got its
name in Anglo-Saxon times when a granular salt the size of a kernel of
wheat--"corn," of course, to a Briton--was used to process it.  To
corn, combine:

A 5-lb. piece of beef:  brisket or tongue which has been placed in a
deep enameled pot or stoneware jar.

Add:

3 cloves garlic

Weight meat to keep it submerged, and cover pot.

Cure in refrigerator 3 weeks, turning meat every 5 days.

If it is to be stored, wash in lukewarm water, dry thoroughly, then
wrap in layers of heavy paper and hang in a cool, dry place.
