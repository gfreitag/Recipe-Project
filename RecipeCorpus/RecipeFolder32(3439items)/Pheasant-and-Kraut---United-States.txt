Saute pheasant pieces in butter and brown well. Drain kraut and put
in a large sauce pan. Add pepper, celery seeds and salt pork. Pour in
wine and simmer for one hour. Add pheasant pieces and make sure they
are well buried, simmer for one more hour. Combine the sausage and
simmer until pheasant is quite tender, about half an hour more.
