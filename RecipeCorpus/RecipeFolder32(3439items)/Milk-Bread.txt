"Bread Machines" article by Beatrice Ojakangas; author of Great
Holiday Baking Book and the forthcoming Light Muffins (Clarkson N.
Potter).

This is a basic loaf of bread that weighs about 1-1/4 pounds, and
works out well in all of the machines I tested. To make a tasty
buttermilk bread, use buttermilk powder in place of the nonfat dry
milk.

Measure the ingredients into the container of the bread machine in the
order given. (Reverse the order in machines which call for adding the
liquids last of all.)

Program the machine for Basic White Bread, light crust and press
start. Source: Good Taste (July 1995).
