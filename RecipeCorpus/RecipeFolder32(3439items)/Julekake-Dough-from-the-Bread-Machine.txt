If you traditionally make Julekake for special occasions, your bread
machine can make the dough with a minimum of mess and counterspace
involved. Fruit is added after the machine has mixed the dough for 15
to

Pour the milk into the bread pan; add butter and stir until melted.
Add the egg. Add the flour, sugar, salt, cardamom and yeast.

Set the machine to the "dough" cycle and press start. After 15 to 18
minutes of mixing, add the cherries and raisins.

In about 1-1/2 hours the machine will indicate the dough is ready.

Remove dough from the machine. Shape into a round ball. Place on a
lightly greased cookie sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place
until almost doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350-F. Uncover dough and bake 30 to 35 minutes until
golden brown and a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the loaf
comes out clean and dry. Cool loaf on a rack. Frost, if desired.
