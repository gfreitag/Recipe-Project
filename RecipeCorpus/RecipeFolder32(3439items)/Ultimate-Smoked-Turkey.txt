Title: Ultimate Smoked Turkey
Categories: Poultry, Bbq/grill
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM-----------------------*INGREDIENTS*----------------------------
1    Turkey - 8 to 10 pounds
1 md Onion
2    Bay leaves
1/2 c  White wine
Super Smoking Sauce - (see
-recipe)
Rinse turkey, pat dry and rub liberally with oil (we'd rub it with
Liquid Smoke instead).  Place onion, bay leaves and wine in water pan
with hot water (we'd add a few sticks of celery and a few cloves of
garlic). Place water pan in smoker and turkey on grid (it won't hurt
to put a quartered onion, a few stalks of celery and a bay leaf
inside the turkey; we also sometimes mix freshly ground black pepper,
a bit of salt and some crushed thyme together and after loosening the
breast skin with your hands, push this mix up under the skin and
spread over the breast of the turkey). Place dome on smoker and do
not remove until midway through cooking time. Then remove dome and
liberally paint turkey with Super Smoking Sauce. Replace dome and
continue smoking.  When turkey is done, liberally paint again and
allow to smoke for 15 minutes more.

Yield:  8 to 10 servings.

Charcoal:  Use 10 pounds charcoal, 5 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks
(we use about 5 to 8 presoaked wood blocks) and smoke 4 to 6 hours.
Electric: Use 4 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks and smoke 4 to 6
hours.

Add water to water pan after about 4 hours or as needed (you can tell
when smoker needs water by the sizzling sound it will make).
