This is an American version of the oriental use of honey in cooking.
The use of honey imparts an even glaze to game birds, sealing in the
juices and adding a delicate flavor.

Combine the first four ingredients and set aside. Rub the pheasant
with the salt and pepper. In a foil lined pan in a preheated 350
oven, melt the butter and remove from the fire. In it arrange the
pheasant, skin side down and brush on some of the honey mixture. Bake
thirty minutes, brushing occasionally with the honey mixture. Turing
the pheasant bake thirty minutes more. Just before serving, dribble
with the remaining honey mixture.
