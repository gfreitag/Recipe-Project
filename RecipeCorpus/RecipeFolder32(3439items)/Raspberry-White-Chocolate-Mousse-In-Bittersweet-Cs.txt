Categories: Chocolate, Fruit
Yield: 10 servings
8 oz White Chocolate, Imported
2 c  Heavy Cream
12 oz Bittersweet Chocolate
2 c  Raspberries, Fresh washed
- and drained
1. Melt white chocolate in a double boiler over hot --- not boiling
--- water or in a glass bowl in a microwave on Medium about 2 to 3
mins, stirring several times. In a medium saucepan, heat cream to
boiling; boil 30 secs. Whisk cream into white chocolate until
thoroughly blended and smooth. Refrigerate 5 to 6 hours, or
overnight,
until well chilled. 2. Meanwhile, prepare bittersweet chocolate Cs.
Place 10 paper muffin Cs in muffin tins. In a microwave or over low
heat, melt bittersweet chocolate until smooth and shiny when
stirred.
Using a table knife or pastry brush, coat inside of paper muffin Cs
with melted chocolate. Be sure coating is not too thin, or Cs will
break when paper is peeled away. Refrigerate until set and well
chilled, 2 to 3 hours. Remove Cs from muffin tin and peel off
paper.
Place chocolate Cs on a baking sheet. Cover loosely and return to
refrigerator. 3. Place white chocolate mousse in a large bowl. Beat
with an electric mixer on high speed, until mixture is fluffy,
stiff,
and holds its shape when beaters are lifted, 4 to 6 mins. Do not
overbeat. 4. Reserve some raspberries for garnish and gently fold
remaing raspberries into white chocolate mousse. Spoon into
chocolate
Cs. Return to refrigerator and chill at least 1 hour and up to 4
hours before serving. Serve garnished with raspberries.

Note: White chocolate and raspberry mixture can also be served
alone
(without chocolate Cs) in stemmed glasses for an attractive
dessert.
NOTES : The section on making chocolate Cs is useful for many other
unique desserts.
