CYRANO JONES SANDWICHES
Prepare graham crackers by separating each into halves. On each place
four squares of chocolate bar. Toast marshmallows on open flame. If
you're little, get an adult to help you with this. Now, quickly place
each marshmallow on one of the chocolate-covere cracker halves and
cover with other half. Squeeze the two halves together until the
marshmallow is flat. Serve. [TCM Note: Okay, so this is just the same
old standard treat of "'Smores". I never said they were _original_.
