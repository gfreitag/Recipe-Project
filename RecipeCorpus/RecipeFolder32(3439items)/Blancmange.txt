Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 recipe
2 1/2 c  Milk, divided
2    Lemon's zest, grated
1 c  (4 oz) slivered almonds
3    Envelopes (1/4 oz)
-unflavored gelatin
5/8 c  Sugar
2 1/2 c  Half-and-half
6 tb Brandy
In a saucepan, combine 2 cups of the milk and the lemon zest.  Bring
to a low simmer; reduce heat to very low and let stand 30 minutes,
covered, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, toast the almonds over very low heat for about 7 minutes,
until they become fragrant and begin to color.  In a food processor
or, blender, grind them finely.

Stir the gelatin into the remaining 1/2 cup of the milk and let rest 1
minute.

Pour the hot milk through a strainer to remove the lemon zest.  Stir
the softened gelatin and the sugar into the hot milk.  If the sugar
and gelatin do not dissolve completely (no grains should be visible
in a metal spoon), heat briefly, stirring.  Stir in the
half-and-half, brandy, and ground almonds.

Pour the mixture into a 1-1/2 quart mold, or into 10 individual molds.
Chill 4 or more hours, until fully set, before unmolding.

Makes 8 to 10 servings.
