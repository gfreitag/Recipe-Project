and cook until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove lid and
keep pot on a very low simmer.

In a third pan, fry bacon until crisp, then crumble into sauerkraut
mixture. Remove most of the bacon fat and fry onions and flour until
they just brown. Mix into sauerkraut mixture.

Remove the meats from the second pan as they become tender. Cut away
fat and bone and cut into small pieces. Add to sauerkraut mixture.
Skim the fat off the meat juices and add to sauerkraut mixture. Take
off skin from kielbasa and cut into slices. Add to sauerkraut mixture
with the tomatoes. Salt, pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, simmer 5
