Tarte de Tours au nougat.

(For a flan ring, about 22 cm / 9 in diameter, 2 cm / 3/4 in deep)

The candied fruits: cut into small dice and place in a saucepan with
the rum. Warm slightly to speed up the maceration and leave to
macerate.

The pastry case: on a lightly floured marble or wooden surface, roll
out the pastry as thinly as possible. Grease the flan ring, stand it
on a baking sheet and line with the pastry. Pinch up the edges of the
pastry to make an attractive, even frill. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
15 minutes before you take the pastry case out of the fridge, preheat
the oven to 200 oC (400 oF).

Prick the bottom of the pastry case with the point of a knife or a
fork, line it with greaseproof paper or foil, fill with baking beans
and bake blind in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Leave to
cool slightly, then remove the beans with a spoon and lift out
carefully the paper or foil.

Reduce the oven temperature to 180 oc (350 oF).

Put the apricot jam in a saucepan and heat until reduced by
one-quarter. Immediately brush the glaze over the bottom of the
pastry case. Spread the candied fruits as evenly as possible on top
of the glaze.

Beat the egg whites until firm, then beat in the sugar. Using a
slotted or metal spoon, gently fold in the ground almond and icing
sugar mixture, taking care not to overwork. Pour the mixture into the
pastry case and smooth the surface with a palette knife. It should be
very smooth.

Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Leave in the tin for 10
minutes, then unmould the tart and place on a wire rack to cool.

Sprinkle lightly with icing sugar and serve this dessert still just
warm. Submitted By RENE GAGNAUX   On   07-05-95
