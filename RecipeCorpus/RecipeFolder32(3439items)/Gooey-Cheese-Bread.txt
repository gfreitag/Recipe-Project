Title: Gooey Cheese Bread
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 c  Water
2    Eggs
1/4    Stick unsalted butter
1 ts Honey
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Yeast
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 c  Swiss cheese -- shredded
Place all dough ingredients in pan and program for knead only.  Press
start.  The dough will be slightly sticky.  After the kneading cycle,
transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic
wrap, and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight, or as long as 24
hours. Grease and flour a 9" cake pan.  Preheat the oven to 375 with
the rack in the center position.  Remove the dough from the
refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured work surface.  Roll
the dough to a 14 x 10 rectangle with the long side nearest you.
Sprinkle 2 cups of the cheese over the surface of the dough.
Starting with the edge closest to you, roll the dough up like a jelly
roll.  Press the edges together and turn it over so the seam is now
facing down.  With the seam still down, roll the cylinder around
itself in a coil and tranfer it to the prepared pan.  Sprinkle the
remaining cheese over the top of the loaf and allow to rise,
uncovered for 20 minutes.  Bake for 35 minutes at 375, then turn the
oven down to 350 and bake for 10 more minutes.  If the cheese begins
to brown quickly during the first 35 minutes, turn the oven down
sooner.
