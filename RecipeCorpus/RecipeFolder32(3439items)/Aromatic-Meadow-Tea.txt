"HEIRLOOM HERBS - Using Old-Fashioned Herbs in GArdens, Recipes and
Decorations" by Mary Forsell.  1990 Running HEads Inc. (my
note...this is an absolutely charming book, a "coffee table" book
full of lovely photographs of breathtaking herb gardens.  The text
contains history of herbal uses through the generations, as well as
