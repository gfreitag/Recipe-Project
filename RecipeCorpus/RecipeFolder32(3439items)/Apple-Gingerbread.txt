3 oz Demerara sugar
1/4 lb Golden syrup
3 oz Butter
6 oz Flour; self-rising
1 ts Ginger; ground

Set oven to 350Ã¸F or Mark 4.  Grease an 8x6-inch baking tin.  Peel,
core and slice the apples.  Put into a pan with a little water and
sufficient sugar to taste.  Stew gently until tender, then mash and
cool. In a separate pan melt the syrup and butter and demerara sugar

ginger, and cloves into a bowl and make a well in the centre.  Add
the egg to the syrup mixture and beat well into the flour.  Stir in

the tin and cook for 30 minutes until firm. Leave to stand for a few
minutes in the tin before turning out to cool on a wire rack; cut
into slices.
