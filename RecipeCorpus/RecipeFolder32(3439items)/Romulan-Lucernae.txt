MMMMM----------------------TANGERINE LAMPS---------------------------
1 ea Tangerines***
Olive oil
Glass votive cups
*** One tangerine per person and a couple extra for practice. Cut
through the rind of the tangerine around the middle, perhaps a little
closer to the stem end than to the bottom. Gently loosen the skin
from the sections, and carefully remove the top (the half including
the stem end). Gently remove the sections from the bottom half, being
sure to leave some of the pithy center part attached to the bottom
half of the shell. Press the pithy strands together to form a sort of
wick about 1/4 to 1/2" long. Put about a spoonful of oil in the
bottom half and swirl it around to coat the inside of the shell. With
the whole inside of the shell oil-coated, the lamp will look better
and last longer. Add or remove oil to leave a slight puddle in the
bottom of the shell about 1/16" deep. Then light the wick. This will
probably take several tries, before it will stay lit. Next, take the
top half, and cut a 1" hole in the center so that the flame can get
air when you set the top back on the bottom half. Oil the inside of
the top half of the lamp, and then wipe it dry so that more light
will be able to shine through. Place the lamp on top of the votive
cup and it is ready. FROM: JOANNE FERRY (CMSJ69B)
