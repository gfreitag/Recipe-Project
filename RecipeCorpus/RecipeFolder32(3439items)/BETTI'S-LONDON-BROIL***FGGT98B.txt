Here is my daughter's favorite recipe.  I have been making London
Broil this way almost as long as I have been married, and that is
over 30 years. Melt butter in skillet. Cook and stir onions and 1/4
tsp salt in the butter until onions are tender. Keep warm over low
heat. Stir together salad oil, lemon juice, garlic, 1/2 tsp salt and
the pepper; brush on top side of meat. Set oven control at broil
and/or 550~ degrees.
Broil meat 2-3 inches from heat about 5 minutes or until brown. Turn
meat; brush with oil mixture and broil just until rare, 5 minutes
longer. Cut meat across grain at a slanted angle into very thin
slices; serve with onions.   NOTE: A can of mushrooms can be added
with the onions. Brisket meat can be substituted for the flank steak.
My Seasoning: 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part
ground black pepper. Mix well before adding to recipe.
