prepared 1 or 2 days in advance, covered and refrigerated].

Individually roast the Peppers over open heat until they are evenly
charred.  Place them in a covered bowl to steam for 10 min., then
scrape off the charred skins with a knife.  Slit the peppers open;
seed and de-vein them, and cut into long slivers. To make the
dressing, roast the cumin and coriander seeds in a small pan over
moderate heat until they darken a few shades.  Place the seeds, the
remaining dressing indgredients, and one roasted pepper in a blender
and process until creamy. Just before serving, peel, seed and dice
the avocado, sprinkle with lime juice. Pour 1 third of the dressing
over the beans and gently mix.  On individual plates or a platter,
arrange black beans, peppers and tomatoes, green beans and avocado.
Top with remaining dressing and drizzle with olive oil.
