moist enough to hold together. Shape dough into ball.
On floured surface, roll dough lightly from center to edge into
12-inch square.  Spread with 1 T softened butter.  Fold 2 sides to
center. Roll to 16 x 10 inch rectangle.  Cut crosswise into 16 (10
inch) strips. Wrap 1 strip around each apple wedge. Place 1/2 inch
apart in ungreased 13 x 9 inch pan.
Brush each wrapped apple wedge with melted butter.  In small
bowl, blend sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over wrapped apples. Bake at
425 degrees for 20 minutes.  Pour water into pan. Bake an additional
12 to 17 minutes or until golden brown. Spoon sauce in pan over
twists.
