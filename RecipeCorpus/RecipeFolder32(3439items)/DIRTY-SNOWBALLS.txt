Title: DIRTY SNOWBALLS
Categories: Cake/cookie, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Sugar, granulated
4 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
4    Eggs
2 ts Vanilla
2 ts Baking powder
2 c  Flour
1 c  Sugar, powdered
Melt chocolate in double boiler or microwave.  Combine melted
chocolate, granulated sugar, vanilla and vegetable oil in a mixer.

Add eggs, one at a time, blending well each time.  Sift (or stir)
together flour and baking powder, add to wet mixture.  Mix well.

Let stand in refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.  Roll dough
into small balls (no more than about 1 inch in diameter), and roll in
powdered sugar until coated. Bake for 12 minutes in a preheated 350
degree F. oven.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate cookies with powdered sugar coating -- This recipe was
handed down to me from my step-sister who got it from her mother.
Yield:  Several dozen.

*  The temperature is very important:  any lower and the cookies
won't bake properly; any higher and the powdered sugar will glaze.

*  If you coat your palms with powdered sugar before attempting to
roll the balls your hands will get less sticky.  Put the dough back
in the refrigerator whenever you are not actively using it; it is
easier to work when cold.

*  You don't actually have to bake these; they make a reasonable
fudge when left uncooked, but if left in the refrigerator for several
days before baking they will become dried out. When done, the unused
powdered sugar will have small shards of chocolate in it; these can
be strained out and the sugar will be re-usable.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling, 20 minutes
baking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
