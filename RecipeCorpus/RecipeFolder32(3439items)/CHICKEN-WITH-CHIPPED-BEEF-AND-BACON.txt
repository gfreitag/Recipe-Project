Cut chipped beef into strips.  Line the baking pan with them.

Wrap bacon around chicken.  Put in pan on top of beef.

NOTES:

*  Succulent and easy chicken -- This recipe makes the most succulent
and juicy chicken I've had.  It is very easy to make.  The only
drawback is that you have to start the night before you want to serve
it. It would be a good recipe for when you have company, since you
can do most of the work the previous day.

*  A note on ingredients for non-US cooks:  "chipped beef" is cooked
spiced beef cut into very thin slices and packaged for sandwiches.  A
worthy substitute is  roast beef sliced very thin and seasoned
lightly with salt and pepper. A "can of mushroom soup," such as
Campbell's soup, is 1 1/2 cups of double-strength cream soup
concentrate. You can substitute the Knorr Swiss dried mushroom soup
mix (available worldwide) if you make it with a mixture of milk and
water. Use 1/2 of a 70-gram package of soup mix with 1 cup of water
and 1/2 cup of milk. Cook the soup according to package directions,
then let cool.

: Difficulty:  easy.
