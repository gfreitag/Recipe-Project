Title: Jamaican Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Chickens, split
1/2 c  Chili sauce
2 tb Cider vinegar
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 c  Minced onion
1    Clove garlic, minced
2 tb Vegetable oil
Wash and dry chickens.  Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl
and marinate chickens for 3 to 4 hours in this mixture.  Remove
chickens from marinade and place on smoker grid.  Brush with marinade
sauce before cooking and just before serving.  (I don't think this
part is right. It would be like eating raw chicken.  I would cook it
for a while.)
