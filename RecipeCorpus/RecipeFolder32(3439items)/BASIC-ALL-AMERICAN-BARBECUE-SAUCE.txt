Recipe by: The Thrill of the Grill by Chris Schlesinger

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, saute the onion in the oil over
medium-high heat until golden brown, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Add all the remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, then reduce the
heat and simmer uncovered at the lowest possible heat for 4 hours.
(This long cooking removes as much acidity as possible from the
tomatoes.)

Puree sauce in 2, 3, or more batches to prevent it from spilling out
of your food processor or blender.

Will keep 2 weeks, covered, in the refrigerator.
