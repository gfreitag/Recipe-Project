Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Sugar
2 tb Orange juice
1 c  Water

Select prickly pear cactus (or small barrel cactus if you own one
since it is illegal to remove it from the desert,) and remove spines
and outside layer with large knife.  Cut pulp across in slices 1 inch
thick. Soak overnight in cold water; cut in 1 inch cubes and cook in
boiling water until tender. Drain. Cook slowly in the following syrup
until nearly all the syrup is absorbed. Do not scorch.

Heat all ingredients until sugar is dissolved.  Add cactus.  Remove
cactus from syrup, drain and roll in granulated or powdered sugar.
For colored cactus candy, any vegetable coloring may be added to
syrup.
