I do not have any idea what "Chicago Style" is.  While virtually any
bread recipe will work as a pizza dough, this is what I use for two
crusts:

Soften yeast in warm water for about 10 minutes.  Mix in ingredients
(except the flour) and combine well.  Add flour all at once and knead
until a smooth dough is formed.  If it is a bit sticky, then add a
little more flour. Let rise for an hour, beat down, roll out and
spread one's choice of toppings. If you are pressed for time, the
first rising can be shortened to 15 minutes, but this is not
recommended. MK
