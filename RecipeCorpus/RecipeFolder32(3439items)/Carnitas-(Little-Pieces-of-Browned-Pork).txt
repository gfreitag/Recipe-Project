Title: Carnitas (Little Pieces of Browned Pork)
Categories: Tex/mexican, Meats, Snacks
Yield: 6 servings
3 lb Pork shoulder, skin and bone
-removed *
Cold water
2 ts Salt, or to taste
* There is no need for an expensive cut.  Shoulder, butt, or
country-style spareribs are all suitable.

Cut the meat, with the fat, into strips about 2 x 3/4 inches. Barely
cover the meat with water, add the salt, and bring to a boil,
uncovered.

Lower the flame and let the meat continue cooking briskly until all
of the liquid has evaporated -- by this time it should be cooked
through but not falling apart.

Lower the flame a little and continue cooking the meat until all of
the fat has been rendered out of it.  Keep turning the meat until it
is lightly browned all over, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

The meat will get more evenly cooked if the dish is rather large and
shallow.  Do not add too much water at the beginning or the meat will
fall apart at the frying stage.  If the meat is still fairly hard
when the water has evaporated, then add a little more water and
continue cooking. Choose pork that has a fair amount of fat or you
will have to add some lard for it to brown properly.

Makes 6 servings.

"Certainly throughout the central part of Mexico, carnitas (literally
'little meats') are the very favorite snack.  They can be crisp or
juicy, with a little bone or without, and sometimes mixed with the
soft rind and little bits of fat all chopped up together.  Whatever
you choose, douse it well with a fresh sauce (Salsa Mexicano Cruda),
Salsa de Tomate Verde Cruda, or Guacamole---and wrap it in a hot,
floppy tortilla--the simplest and most delicious taco."
