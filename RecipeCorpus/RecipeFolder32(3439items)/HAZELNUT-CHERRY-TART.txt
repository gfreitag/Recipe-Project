Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
1/2 c  Plain flour
1/8 ts Salt
2 oz Hazelnuts, roasted
-ground
2 tb Sugar
2 oz Butter
1    Egg yolk
2 ts Water
MMMMM----------------------CUSTARD FILLING---------------------------
4    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 3/4 c  Cream
3 ts Gelatine
2 tb Water
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2 lb Cherries, canned
2 ts Gelatine
2 ts Rum (see note)
MAKE PASTRY:  Sift flour and add all dry ingredients together, with
the sugar in the centre, on a pastry board. Add the butter
(softened), egg yolk and water. Work the liquids into the sugar,
until it is creamy.

Now work in the flour mixture, as you would for any sweet pastry.
Press the dough into a greased 9-inch flan tin. Prick the base of the
pastry all over. Refrigerate for 30 mins, then cook in a moderate
oven (375 degrees F.) for 15 to 20 mins (until golden brown)

MAKE FILLING:  Put egg yolks, sugar and vanilla into a bowl and beat
until thick and creamy.  Heat cream carefully until almost boiling.

Combine the two mixtures, beating until smooth, then add the result
to the top of a double boiler and simmer until it thickens (STIR
CONSTANTLY).

Dissolve the gelatine in the water and add to the cream mixture,
stirring well until it is well mixed. Allow this mixture to cool
completely before adding to the pastry case. Refrigerate until it
sets.

MAKE TOPPING:  Drain the cherries and reserve about 1 cup of the
syrup. We don't use commercial canned cherries.  I would suggest a
"light" syrup. Arrange the pitted cherries artistically over the top
of the tart.

Put the reserved syrup, gelatine and rum (we usually use cherry
brandy or kirsch) into a saucepan and heat (stirring) until gelatine
dissolves.  Cool the liquid and pour over the cherries.  Refrigerate
until set.

NOTES:

*  A thoroughly decadent desert -- This has simply got to be the best
dessert you'll ever try. My wife has made this one many times. The
only complaint ever lodged is that there was not enough.

*  Don't be put off by the complexity of the recipe; it is well worth
the effort.

*  All the egg whites "wasted" can be used in something else, such as
a Pavlova.

: Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
: Time:  several hours preparation, cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients carefully.
