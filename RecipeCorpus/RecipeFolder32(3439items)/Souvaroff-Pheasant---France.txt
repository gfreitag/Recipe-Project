Combine the large glass of Madeira and meat glaze in a medium sized
sauce pan, add truffles and cook for five minutes. Take out the
truffles and put them in the casserole dish in which the pheasant
will be cooked.

Cut the foie gras into large pieces, stiffen these in the truffles'
cooking liquid and stuff the pheasant with these. Truss the bird,
wrapping it in bacon slices and two-thirds roast it.

When this is done, put the pheasant into the casserole containing the
truffles, add the roasting liquid, the small glass of Madeira and game
gravy. Cover the casserole and continue cooking for about fifteen
minutes.
