This is a nutty, old-fashioned spice cake traditional in the South.
When made with raspberry or blackberry jam it's called " Jam Cake".

For one Bundt cake, 10 to 12 servings, you will need:

Vanilla wafer crumbs Sliced oranges, for garnish

Caramel Frosting: Combine 3/4 cup light brown sugar, 1/4 cup whipping
cream, 2 teaspoons dark corn syrup, and a pinch of salt in a
saucepan. Add 2 tablespoons butter. Bring to a boil. Boil until syrup
reaches 234 degrees F on a candy thermometer or until a drop in cold
water forms a soft ball. Beat until cooled and creamy.

Preparation:

1. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar,
cinnamon, baking powder, soda, salt, cloves, nutmeg, butter,
marmalade, eggs, milk, lemon juice and nuts.

2. Blend at low speed, scraping the bowl. Increase speed to medium
and beat for 2 minutes.

3. Butter an 8 1/2-inch (10-cup) tube type pan. Dust with vanilla
wafer crumbs.

4. Pour batter into the prepared pan.

5. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55 minutes or just until a skewer
inserted in the center comes out clean.

6. Remove from the oven. Cool 5 minutes.

7. Turn out of pan and finish cooling on a rack.

8. Glaze with Caramel Frosting and garnish with sliced fruit.
