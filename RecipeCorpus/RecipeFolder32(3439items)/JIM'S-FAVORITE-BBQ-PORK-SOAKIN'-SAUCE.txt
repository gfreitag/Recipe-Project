Title: JIM'S FAVORITE BBQ PORK SOAKIN' SAUCE
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill, Meats
Yield: 2 servings
1 c  White vinegar
1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Water
1 lg Yellow onion; dice & saute
4 lg Garlic cloves; mince & saute
1/2 c  Brown sugar; packed
2    Whole fresh lemon; sliced
-with peel and pulp removed
1 lg Bay leaf
3/4 ts Red pepper flakes
3/4 ts Ground black pepper
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Vegetable salad oil
4 tb Water
1 1/2 c  Chili sauce
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Soy sauce; (optional)
1 tb Dry mustard
This sauce is added to boston butt pork right off the grill and
shredded for BBQ sandwiches.  About 30 minutes before mealtime, add
enough sauce to the pork for it to "puddle" slightly around the meat.
Put all, except for last 5 ingredients, in a 3 quart covered sauce
pan and simmer for 1 hour.  Remove pan from heat and add remaining
ingredients. Mix well, recover, and set aside for at least 2 hours
allowing flavors to blend.
*If desired, some of the sauce may be prepared extra "spicy" for use
at the table to enhance the BBQ sandwich flavor. Put 3/4 cup of the
sauce in a separate saucepan, add an additional 1/4 ts red pepper
flakes and simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and add another
1/2 ts dry mustard (make a paste with a tad bit of cold water). Put
in a small pouring pitcher and pass around table.  Be sure to have
enough cold beer to go with this sauce.
The sauces will stay fresh for 2 weeks under refrigeration - just
long enough for seconds on that butt.
