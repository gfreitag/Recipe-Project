Put four ounces of butter in a deep dish. When butter is hot cook the
pheasant until golden brown, add the shallots and onions and cook
slowly for three or four minutes. Add wine, tomatoes, mushrooms,
broth, salt and pepper to taste. Cook slowly for twenty five minutes.
Remove the pheasant pieces and keep warm. If desired, trim off wing
tips and exposed bones.

Boil the broth slowly and thicken with two ounces of butter blended
with the flour. Boil the sauce slowly for five minutes, add the
tarragon, bay leaf and thyme. Pour over the pheasant pieces.
