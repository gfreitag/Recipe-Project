See note
* Note:  The recipes for 10 different strudel fillings are included
in this database.    Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.  Make a
well in the center and drop the eggs, oil and water into it.  Work
into the flour, mixing until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl.
Knead the dough for 10 minutes or until ver dough as thin as you can.
Now you must begin stretching it. Flour the knuckles of your hands
and gently pull the dough toward you from underneath, using the back
of your hands. Change your position as the dough stretches so as not
to put too much strain on any one part.  Stretch until dough is
transparent, then brush with oil or melted butter.  Cut away any
thick edges. Spread one of the fillings over half the surface; then
raise the cloth and roll up the strudle from the filled side, guiding
it with the other hand. Place on a heavily greased baking pan. Brush
with oil or melted butter.    Bake in a 400 degree oven 35 minutes or
until browned and crisp. Cut into 1 1/2-inch slices immediately.
Makes about 40 slices. If you like a smaller strudel, divide dough in
two before rolling, makes 2 strudels.   Comments:  Strudel dough
takes practice and patience. Your first few tries may not be
successful but try again--it's worth it.    Recipe Source: THE ART OF
