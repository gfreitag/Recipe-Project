Title: Sweet flan pastry
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 1 servings
300 g  Unsalted butter
500 g  Plain flour
150 g  Sugar
1 ds Salt
1    Egg yolk
1    Egg
Put the butter, cut into pieces, with the flour, sugar and salt, into
a mixer. Work it until the mixture resembles coarse semolina.

Add the egg yolk and the whole egg and do not work the machine for a
moment longer than necessary (VERY IMPORTANT) to amalgamate the eggs
with the flour mixture. Form it into a ball and leave it to rest in
the refrigerator for several hours before using it.

(The pastry will keep very well in the refrigerator for a few days,
wrapped in transparent film)
