Title: HOLLANDAISE
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
4    Egg yolks
3 tb Lemon juice
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Dry mustard
8    Drops Tabasco sauce
* Into the top of a double broiler put all ingredients Place about
one inch of water in the bottom part of the double boiler, and bring
water to a boil.  Turn the fire down to very low. Place the top part
of the double boiler into the bottom part.  Add 1 stick (1/2 c) of
VERY COLD butter to the egg mixture.  Whisk until the butter melts
and the sauce thickens. Keep the sides and bottom scraped.  If the
water seems to be boiling too much simply lift the top part of the
double boiler out of the bottom, and let it calm down.
When the sauce thickens, put a top on, and try to>>> serve as soon as
possible.  This never curdles on me.
Let me know if it does on you.  Sometimes, I even reheat this (if I
ever have leftovers).  When I reheat it, it curdles. The trick then
is the following:  Add a small amount of milk (about 1/2 to 1
teaspoon), and whisk, whisk, whisk.  Hope this is the info you need.
