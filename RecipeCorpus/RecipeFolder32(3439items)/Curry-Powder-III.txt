Categories: Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
"Although purists are
-correct in saying that
-there is no such thing as a
Standardized curry powder
-in Indian cuisine, there
-are several good mixtures
Of spices sold outside
-India as "curry powder."
-This is one version of such
seasoning.  It is obviously fresher and, by intention, more delicate
than any store-bought version. Make a small amount and adjust it to
your taste. If you prefer a hot curry powder, add as many tiny dried
hot peppers as you like to the pan with the whole spices to be
toasted (first removing all their seeds), then grind them with the
other spices. "Don't make a very large amount of curry powder at
once, as the spice flavors tend to fade or become acrid if kept too
long." Makes 1/2 c Optional, although recommended: 2 1/2 ts fenugreek
20 med cardamom pods, or enough to produce 1 ts seeds (smack the pods
with a meat pounder or flat side of a cleaver to crack them and
release the seeds) 3 Tbs coriander seeds 1 Tb cumin seeds 1 Tb
mustard seeds 6 whole cloves 1 thin cinnamon stick (2 to 3" long),
broken into pieces 1/4 ts ground mace 1/4 ts grated nutmeg big pinch

min, shaking the pan a few times. Let cool. Combine the toasted

peppers in a spice mill and grind to a powder.  Store airtight. From
