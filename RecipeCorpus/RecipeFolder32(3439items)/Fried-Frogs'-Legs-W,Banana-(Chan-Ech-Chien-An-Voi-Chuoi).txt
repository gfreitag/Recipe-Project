cornstarch and mix well.  Place in the refrigerator and leave to
marinate for at least 2 hours. 2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large

flour with the salt and baking powder. Stir in enough water to form a
liquidy paste.  Lightly fold in the beaten egg white. 5. Heat 3
inches oil in a wok.  Peel the bananas, cut in half lengthwise and
dunk into the batter.  Dip them into the hot oil and cook in batches
until golden and puffy.  Drain on paper towels and serve with the
frogs' legs.
