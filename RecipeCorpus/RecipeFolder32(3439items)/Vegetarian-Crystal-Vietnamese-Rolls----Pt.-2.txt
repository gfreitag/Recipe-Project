thoroughly and squeeze out excess water.  If using regular mushrooms,
wash and dry them thoroughly.  Slice thinly. 4. Place a clean tea
towel on the surface you are working on.  Dip a single sheet of Banh
Trang into warm water and place it on the tea towel. It should be
soft and pliable but not too wet. Place some vermicelli, dried
mushrooms, wood ear fungus, pickl 5. Spread the filling into a
sausage shape.  Roll the bottom edge of the Banh Trang up and tuck
tightly under the mixture.  Fold the left and right sides into the
center and continue rolling away from you.  Continue until all the
mixture is used. 6. Place the vegetarian rolls on a dish. The guests
help themselves to letuce leaves, one at a time. On the lettuce they
place a roll, some mint, cilantro, and cucumber. They then roll
everything up and dip it in the dipping sauce.
