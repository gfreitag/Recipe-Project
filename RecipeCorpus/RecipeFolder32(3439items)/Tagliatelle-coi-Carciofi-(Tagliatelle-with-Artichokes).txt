Categories: Vegetables, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 6 servings
4 sm To medium artichokes
1    Lemon
1 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
4 oz Pancetta, minced
1 md Onion
1/4 c  White wine
1 c  Chicken broth, homemade if
-possible
One pound fresh tagliatelle Parmigiano cheese Salt Freshly ground
black pepper

1. In a bowl large enough to accommodate the following, mix the juice
of the lemon and enough water to cover the 4 artichokes and the hull
of the lemon. Pull off the tough outer leaves of the artichokes.
Slice the artichokes lengthwise into bite-size pieces and slip into
the acidulated water for approximately 1/2 hour to soften them.

2. Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter together in a heavy skillet,
add the pancetta and onion, and cook until lightly golden brown.

3. Drain the artichokes and douse them, in the same bowl, with the
white wine. Place them in the skillet and cook over medium-low,
tossing. When the liquid disappears, add the broth. Cook covered for
1/2 hour. Reduce the liquid to a sauce-like consistency. Add salt and
black pepper to taste. Serve over tagliatelle cooked al dente.
Sprinkle with the grated cheese. Source: Journal of Italian Food &
