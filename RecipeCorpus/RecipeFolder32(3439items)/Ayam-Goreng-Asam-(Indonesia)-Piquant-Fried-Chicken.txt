Title: Ayam Goreng Asam (Indonesia) Piquant Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2    Roasting chicken
3    Cloves garlic
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Ground black pepper
1 ts Palm sugar or substitute
2 ts Ground coriander
1/2 ts Ground turmeric
1/3 c  Tamarind liquid
Oil for frying
Cut chicken into small serving pieces. Crush garlic with salt to a
smooth paste and combine with pepper, sugar, coriander, cummin,
turmeric and tamarind liquid. Rub over the chicken pieces and leave
for 1 hour, or cover and marinade in refrigerator overnight. Heat
enough oil in a large heavy frying pan to cover base of pan. Take
chicken pieces from marinade and drain on paper towels to get rid of
excess moisture. Put pieces into the frying pan and cook over medium
heat for 2 minutes on each side, turning with tongs until golden
brown. Reduce heat, cover pan and cook for 10-12 minutes longer,
turning pieces half-way through. Drain on absorbent paper and serve
warm.
