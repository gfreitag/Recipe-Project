Categories: Vegetables, Italian, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
6    Fresh, large artichokes
1    Lemon
2    Cloves garlic, minced with
-->
2 tb Minced fresh Italian
-parsley, and
12 tb Minced fresh mint
3/4 c  Chicken broth
3/4 c  Dry white wine
8 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1. Remove large outer leaves of artichokes. With a sharp scissor,
trim the remaining outer leaves so that they are about 1-1/2 inches
long, squaring them off neatly in the process. Square off the bottoms
so the artichokes will sit upright while cooking. With a very sharp
knife, slice the top of the artichoke off about 1/2 inch down,
removing any spines that stick out. Rub the cut edges as you go along
with the open side of a split lemon.

2. Gently open the leaves and in each of the outer openings, stuff a
bit of the mint-parsley-garlic mixture.

3. In a deep casserole that can be fitted with a cover big enough to
accommodate the artichokes in one layer standing upright, heat 2
tablespoons of the olive oil. Place the artichokes, bottoms down, in
the pan, add the white wine and broth, bring to a boil, lower to a
simmer and cover loosely. After 15 minutes, check artichokes for
tenderness by piercing with a long-tined fork. Finish cooking if need
be, remove to a warm platter, reduce sauce and drizzle on top of each
artichoke. Serve warm, but not blazingly hot.
