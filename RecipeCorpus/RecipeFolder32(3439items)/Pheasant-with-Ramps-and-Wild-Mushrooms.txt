Hayes writes: "Ramps (allium tricoccum) are wild leeks.  In early
spring, their broad green leaves and oniony aroma permeate fields and
forest floors in the eastern half of North America as far south as
Georgia. Morels are one of the few mushrooms that have defied
cultivation. As a result, they are available only from early spring
through early summer and can be very expensive."
