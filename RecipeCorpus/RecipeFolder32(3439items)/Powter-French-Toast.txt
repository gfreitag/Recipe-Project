Beat the eggs and egg whites together.

Add the milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to the eggs and mix well.

Soak the sliced bread in the egg mixture for approx 5 mins, until the
mixture is absorbed.

Preheat oven to 350.  Arrange bread on a nonstick baking sheet.  Bake
for approx 15 mins, until bread is lightly browned. Or, fry slices in

My note:  I dip the slices in the mixture in a bowl, then pour any
remaining over to soak in.  This stuff is really good!
