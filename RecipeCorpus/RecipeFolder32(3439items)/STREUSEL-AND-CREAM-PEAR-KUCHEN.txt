In a large saucepan, combine pears, 1/4 cup lemon juice and enough
water to cover tops of pears. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer,
covered, for 10 minutes or until tender. Drain pears; set aside.
Grease two 9 inch round cake or springform pans. In large bowl,
combine hot-roll mix with yeast from foil packet, 1/4 cup sugar and
1/2 tsp cinnamon. Stir in hot water, 1/4 cup butter and 1 egg until
well combined; dough will be soft and sticky. Divide dough evenly
between greased pans; pat out dough to cover bottom of pans. Cover
with plastic wrap and towel. Let rise in warm place (80 to 85
degrees) for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine all filling ingredients. Beat at
medium speed until smooth; set aside. In another small bowl, combine
first four streusel ingredients; mix well. Cut in butter until
crumbly. Set aside.
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Uncover dough. With lightly floured
hands, gently pat edges of dough halfway up the sides of the pans.
Pour filling mixture evenly over dough in each pan. Sprinkle streusel
mixture evenly over each filling. Thinly slice pear halves
lengthwise, keeping slices together. Place four halves, rounded side
up, on top of streusel mixture in each pan. Sprinkle pear halves with
a mixture of 1 Tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.
Bake at 375 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes or until edges of kuchen
are golden brown and filling is set. If desired, sprinkle with
powdered sugar just before serving. Serve warm. Store leftovers in
refrigerator. 2 kuchens (8 servings per cake) Upl by Dr. Jim
