Title: ANT/ROACH KILLER
Categories: Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Powdered boric acid *
1 ts Sugar (confectioners or
-granulated)
-Pepsi Cola (optional) **
* (boric acid may be obtained at most any drug store) ** Coca Cola or
RC will work but I prefer to drink them and consign Pepsi to this
fate.

Mix boric acid and sugar until well combined. Add Pepsi and mix until
you have a thick semi-liquid paste. Put mixture in bottle caps and
place in areas where bugs are active. Wait a few days and bug traffic
will dwindle and die off. Keep one or two caps on duty in case of
second attack.

There are two types of ants... sugar seeking ants and oil seeking
ants. If you are after ants and this doesn't get them - substitute
butter, oil, or margarine for the sugar in the receipe and forget
about the Pepsi (not a bad idea, anyway B^)= ). Nasty old cucaroaches
don't care. Either mixture will zap them just as dead.

Now, for the bonus... this stuff is non-lethal to pets and humans.
It's environmentally friendly. It's cheap. It's so politically
correct it ought to run for office. And best of all - IT WORKS!!!

Tested and approved in (hanging head and scuffing toe in dirt) Uncle
Dirty Dave's Kitchen. With many thanks to retired Ag Science teacher
and ex F-I-L, Bill Renaud of Mt. Auburn, IL.
