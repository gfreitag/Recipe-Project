Season beef steaks and lamb chops generously with this pungent rub.

1. Toast peppercorns, coriander, and cumin over medium heat in small
skillet, shaking pan occasionally to prevent burning, until first
wisps of smoke appear, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cool to room
temperature, then mix with pepper flakes and cinnamon.

2. Grind to powder in spice grinder or with mortar and pestle. Source:
