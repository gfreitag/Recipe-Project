Title: Apples Baked in Parchment
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
4    McIntosh, Granny Smith or
-Red Delicious apples
1/4 c  Sugar
4 tb Orange zest
4    Vanilla beans
Preheat oven to 350F. Cut apples in half horizontally and remove
seeds with a melon baller. Place  tbs of the sugar into the cavity of
each half apple and caramelize it (place the apples under a preheated
broiler for 1-2 minutes). Sprinkle orange zest on top of the
caramelized sugar.

For each serving, place two apple halves on a 12x10-inch piece of
parchment paper. Add 1 vanilla bean, which has been slit to release
the seeds (do not scrape out seeds). Fold in the sides and close the
top of the parchment paper, securing with a toothpick if necessary.
Bake the apples for about 20-25 minutes. Open the packages (but do
not unwrap the apples entirely) and remove the vanilla beans. Serve
hot.
