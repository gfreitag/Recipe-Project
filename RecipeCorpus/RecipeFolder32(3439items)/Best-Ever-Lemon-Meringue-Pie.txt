....................................................................
"Have I got a treat for you! It is the world's best (and easiest to
make) lemon meringue pie. No, this not a recipe my grandmother gave
me. It is one I got about 15 years ago from a cab driver in New
York." --- Ann Landers
...................................................................

Mix sugar and cornstarch in top of double boiler. Add water. Combine
egg yolks and lemon juice; beat until well mixed. Add to sugar
mixture. Cook over boiling water until thick, about 25 minutes. Add
lemon extract, vinegar and butter; stir throughly. Pour mixture into
pie shell and cool.

FOR MERINGUE, blend cornstarch and cold water in saucepan. Add boiling
water and cook, stirring until clear and thickened. Let stand until
completely cold.

With electric beater at high speed, beat egg whites until foamy.
Gradually add sugar; beat until stiff but not dry. Turn mixer to low
speed. Add vanilla and salt. Gradually beat in cornstarch mixture.
Turn mixer to high and beat well. Spread meringue over cooled pie
filling.

browned.
