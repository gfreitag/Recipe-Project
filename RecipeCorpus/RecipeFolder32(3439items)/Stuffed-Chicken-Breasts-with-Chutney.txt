mixture. Roll meat around filling to enclose; fasten with wooden
picks. Place chicken rolls in pan used for spinach.

In a small bowl, mix vinegar, stock and chutney. Pour over chicken.

Increase heat to high and bring chutney mixture to a boil. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1/2 cup (about 5 minutes);
then pour over chicken. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup spinach.
