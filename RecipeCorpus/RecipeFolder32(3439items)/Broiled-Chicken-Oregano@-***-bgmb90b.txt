Title: Broiled Chicken Oregano@ *** bgmb90b
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
4    Chicken breast
1/3 c  Lemon juice
1/3 c  Olive oil
Salt & pepper to taste
1/3 c  Lemon juice
3 tb Oregano, fresh or 1 t dried
Several hours before serving-or the day before, if time allows, rub
the chicken pieces pieces with the garlic and place them in a deep
china or earthenware bowl. Combine marinade ingredients and the
garlic clove and pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate
the chicken. Turn chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook,
preheat the broiler to its highest setting. Arrange the chicken
pieces on the broiler rack and baste with a little of the melted
butter mixture. (Reserve part of the basting mixture to serve over
the chicken when served.) Broil the chicken 3-4 inches from the heat
for 5-8 minutes per side, basting often. Chicken is done when juices
run clear when pierced with a sharp knife. Remove to serving platter,
pour reserved basting mixture over the chicken breasts and serve
immediately. This is also good done on a BBQ.
