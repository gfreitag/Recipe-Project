Clean fresh Carp roe(eggs) of all membrane and salt well. Place in
enamel or porcelain bowl and cover, keep in basement or cool place
for 2 to 3 days, or until roe acquires an orange color. Place in a
mixer and beat well, adding oil a little at a time, until it is all
absorbed. Soak bread in milk. Add soaked bread, onion, lemon juice,
pepper and continue beating until light and fluffy. Keep
refrigerated. Serve on crackers or thin rye bread. This is like a
poor-man's caviar, though I prefer salmon eggs to carp. And yes, crap
is the romanian word for carp! Submitted By MARK MIKLAS   On
