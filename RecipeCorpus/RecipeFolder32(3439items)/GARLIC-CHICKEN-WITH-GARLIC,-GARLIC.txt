1    Whole frying chicken (3 lbs)
40    Unpeeled garlic cloves (!!)
Salt & Pepper to taste
3/4 c  Dry white wine
Pat the chicken dry.  Rub inside and out with one split clove of
garlic. Lightly salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 400~. Place chicken
on a roasting rack in a baking pan and arrange cloves of garlic
around the pan. Place in oven and reduce heat to 350~. Bake 20
minutes then pour wine over chicken. Baste again in 10 minutes and
again 10 minutes later. Roast a total of 1 hour.
According to Jeff Smith: "My friends serve this chicken on a
platter with the garlic on the side.  In this way, you can squirt the
cooked garlic cloves onto bread, rolls, or potatoes."
According to Gaye:  I have not tried this.  I don't have the guts!!
