Put the water, sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon stick into a pan and over a
very low heat dissolve the sugar. Then bring the syrup to the boil
and boil it rapidly for a minute. Remove the pan from the heat.

Plunge the peaches into a pan of boiling water for a quick count of
ten, then transfer them to cold water and peel off the skins. Cut
each peach in half and remove the stone. Put the fruit halves into
the syrup and poach them over a low heat for 3 minutes.

Leave the fruit in the syrup to cool, then stir in the Drambuie and
chill the peaches for at least 4 hours before serving.

Serve with cream.
