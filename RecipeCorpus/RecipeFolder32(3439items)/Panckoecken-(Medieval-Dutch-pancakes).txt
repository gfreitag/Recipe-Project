Title: Panckoecken (Medieval Dutch pancakes)
Categories: West europe, Medieval, Breads
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Flour
7/8 oz Fresh yeast
1 1/4 c  Tepid milk
1    Egg
7/8 oz Melted butter
1/3 oz Salt
Make a dough from the ingredients and knead it, preferably with your
hands. After you've done that, let the dough raise for one hour.
Then roll it out as thinly as you can manage (stop when small holes
appear) on a flour-dusted surface.  In the middle ages, people
deep-fried the panckoecken in rapeseed oil.

For special occasions they sometimes added a few raisins or small
pieces of apple (used as a cake for Lent). At what stage of the
preparation is not known, but I assume they added them to the dough
before rolling it out. This way, the pancakes turn out thicker, but
that's what is needed to keep the raisins or pieces of apple from
falling out. Since this is a medieval recipe, it didn't have a list
of ingredients, only instructions. The amounts of the ingredients
mentioned in this recipe are educated guesses by the Dutch cookbook
author Annie van't Veer.
