Title: Shrimps Pacifica
Categories: Main dish, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Large raw shrimp in shell
1/2 c  Peanut oil or salad oil
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1 ts Italian seasoning
1 ts Seasoned salt
1/2 ts Seasoned pepper
2 tb Brown sugar
1 ts Soy sauce
1/4 c  Green onions, thinly sliced
Wash shrimps under cold running water; remove feelers but do not
shell; drain on paper toweling.  Place in medium size bowl. Stir
peanut oil or salad oil, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, and seasoned
salt and pepper together.  Pour over shrimp and let stand for about
30 minutes -- stirring frequently.  I prefer to let them stay in the
marinade overnight in the frig. Lift shrimp from the marinade about
1/2 hour before barbecuing and let them drain. Place on grill about 6
inches from hot coals. Brush with marinade.  Grill, turning once and
brushing with marinade. Takes about 6 minutes per side or until pink.
Pour remaining marinade into a small saucepan, stir in brown sugar
and soy sauce. Heat to boiling, then stir in green onions. Serve
separately as a dip for shrimp. Have plenty of napkins or damp
washcloths. I use shrimp that is 12-16 per lb. I figure about 4 per
person -- but sometimes for big eaters 6 per person. I then make an
extra half of recipe of the marinade.
