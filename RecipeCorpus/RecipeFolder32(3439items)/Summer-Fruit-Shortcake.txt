or two knives, cut in shortening and butter until well mixed.  With
fork, blend in soured milk to make soft dough.  Don't overmix.  Turn
out dough onto lightly floured surface; knead 6-8 times.  Roll out or
pat dough to 1/2 inch thickness. Using floured 3 inch round cutter,
cut out 6 biscuits. Sprinkle lightly with more sugar. Bake on greased
baking sheet in 425 F oven for 12-15 minutes or until tops are
browned. Let cool until warm;cut in half horizontally.  Spoon fruit
mixture onto bottom halves of biscuits, reserving some fruit for
garnish. Stir strawberry puree with remaining sugar; spoon over fruit
mixture. Top with dollop of whipped cream, then biscuit tops. Garnish
