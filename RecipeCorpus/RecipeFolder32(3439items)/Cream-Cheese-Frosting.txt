Title: Cream Cheese Frosting
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Cream cheese -- at room
-temperature
6 tb Unsalted butter -- at room
-temperature
1 1/4 c  Confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and butter. Using an
electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat until smooth. Reduce
the speed to low, add the confectioner's sugar and again beat until
smooth. Beat in the vanilla extract until well blended.

To store, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Bring to room
temperature before using. Makes about 2 3/4 cups.

Variations: Almond flavor: Add 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract with the
vanilla extract.

Orange flavor:  Add 2 tablespoons undiluted thawed, frozen orange
juice concentrate and 1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange zest with the
vanilla extract.

Coconut flavor:  Bring 1 can sweetened cream of coconut to a boil in a
large, heavy saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer without stirring
for 10 minutes. You should have about 1 cup. Remove from the heat and
refrigerate for 1 hour until cool, then beat the cooled coconut cream
into the finished frosting. Add 1 cup toasted sweetened shredded
coconut and beat until fully combined. This will yield 4 cups
frosting. For an easier coconut-flavored frosting, beat 1 1/2
teaspoons imitation coconut extract and the 1 cup toasted coconut
into the finished plain cream cheese frosting.
