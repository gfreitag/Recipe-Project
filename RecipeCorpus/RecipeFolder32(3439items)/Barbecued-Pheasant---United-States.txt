Cut pheasants and dredge in seasoned flour. Brown in hot oil. Saute
onions in melted butter until tender. Combine brown sugar and
cornstarch; mix with onions. Gradually add remaining ingredients and
season well. Cook slowly twenty minutes or until thick. Pour sauce
over pheasant. Cover. Bake in a preheated 300 oven for one and a half
hours, basting often to prevent drying.
