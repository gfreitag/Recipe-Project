tablespoon of the milk over part of the mixture.  Gently toss with a
fork. Push to side of bowl.  Repeat till all is moistened.

On a lightly floured surface roll dough into an 11-inch square.  Cut
into four 5 1/2-inch squares.

Remove and discard core or pit from fruit.  Peel and chop fruit.
Place 1/4 of the fruit on half of each square of dough.

In a small bowl stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
Sprinkle over fruit.  Dot with some of the butter.

Moisten edges of squares with a little milk.  Shape into rectangles by
folding squares in half over fruit mixture.  With the tines of a fork,
press edges to seal.

Place on an ungreased baking sheet and make small slashes to allow
steam to escape.  Brush with milk and sprinkle with additional sugar,
if desired. Bake in a 375F oven for 14 to 18 minutes or till brown on
edges. Transfer to a wire rack.  Serve warm or cool.
