-about 6 oz each
MMMMM---------------------------SALSA--------------------------------
1    English Cucumber, finely

1    Green Onion, thinly sliced
1 tb Fresh Mint, cut into thin

4 tb Seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar
2 c  Fresh Strawberries, hulled
-and finely diced
MMMMM-----------------------BARBECUE SAUCE----------------------------
1/2 c  Unsalted Butter
1    Clove Garlic, finely chopped

For best results, prepare salsa 1 hour ahead. In a medium bowl, mix
cucumber, green onion, mint and vinegar. Cover with plastic wrap and
chill for 1 hour. Just before serving, stir in strawberries.

To prepare barbecue sauce, in a small saucepan melt butter with
garlic over low heat. Stir in honey, soy sauce and lemon juice and
cook for 2 minutes. Set aside.

Prepare fire in a charcoal grill. When coals are ready, brush sauce on
salmon pieces and place in a well-oiled fish-grilling rack. Place
rack over coals about 4 inches from fire and grill approximately 4-5
minutes on each side. Brush with sauce again after turning, then
baste again with barbecue sauce as it finishes cooking. You can tell
when fish is done when it is just barely firm and resilient to touch.

To serve, open rack and remove fish fillets with a spatula. Transfer
to a warm platter and top with Strawberry, Mint and Cucumber Salsa.
