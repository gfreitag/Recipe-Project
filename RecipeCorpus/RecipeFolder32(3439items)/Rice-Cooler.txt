Title: Rice Cooler
Categories: Beverages, Spanish, So. america
Yield: 2 quarts
2 c  White rice
1 c  (about 4 oz)blanched almonds
3 tb Ground cinnamon
2 qt Milk; warmed OR hot water
3/4 c  Granulated sugar;or to taste
1 ts Vanilla extract
Kahlua (optional)
Ice cubes
NOTE:
Popular in Central America as well as Spain, this refreshing summer
beverage deserves to become better known north of the border.  When
the rice is steeped in milk rather than water the final result is
tastier. Covered and refrigerated, the cooler keeps up to a week. Top
it off with a splash of Kahlua, if you enjoy the liqueur.

Wash and drain the rice.

In a large bowl, combine the drained rice, almonds, and cinnamon with
the warm milk or water and soak at least 6 hours, or preferably
overnight. Drain, reserving liquid.

Puree half the rice-almond mixture in a food processor or blender. Add
about 1 cup of the reserved liquid and blend until as smooth as
possible. Transfer the blended mixture to a bowl and repeat with the
remaining rice mixture and liquid.

Strain the mixture through 3 layers of dampened cheesecloth into a
glass pitcher or jar, squeezing the cloth to extract all the milky
liquid. Stir in the sugar and vanilla.  Chill and serve over ice
cubes.

Variation:  For a chocolate-flavored drink, add about 1/4 cup
sweetened cocoa powder, or to taste, to the rice and almonds.
