LEMON-GARLIC BUTTER:

Fry garlic in 1 Tb of butter until lightly browned. Add rest of
butter and lemon.  When butter melts, sauce is ready.

ROUGHLY-CHOPPED GARLIC:

Actually, this is not a sauce, but it was such a hit at one squid
party that I am including it here.

Throw in a handful of chopped garlic 1 minute before the squid rings
are ready to come out.  Remove golden brown garlic with a mesh scoop
after you take out the squid. Be sure you get all the pieces out.

Anything left in the oil will burn and impart a bitter flavor to the
next batch of squid.

AIOLI MAYONNAISE:

This French garlic mayonnaise recipe is from The Book of Garlic. It
makes a great dipping sauce for squid. You can make it in a blender
for speed, but it tastes better made the authentic way.

Peel the garlic and pound in a mortar until smooth. Add the egg yolks
and seasoning.  Continue pounding until the paste is smooth. Then
beat in lemon juice with a whisk. Start adding the oil a drop at a
time while continuing to whisk.  If you use a blender, whirl the
garlic, lemon juice and egg yolks for about a minute until smooth and
then add a slow, thin stream of oil while blender is still on high.
Do not over liquefy! The sauce should be thick like mayonnaise. If
the sauce gets too thick, add water or lemon juice.

Makes about 3 cups.
