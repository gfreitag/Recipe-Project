Title: DOPIAZA - (PORK CURRY WITH ONIONS)
Categories: Meats, Curry, Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 lb Onions - skinned
4 fl Ghee or vegetable oil
2 tb Lime or lemon juice
1 1/2 lb Boneless pork, cubed
2 ts Ground coriander
2 ts Turmeric
1 ts Fenugreek seeds
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Chilli powder -more if liked
Chop half the onions very finely. Heat the ghee in a heavy-based
saucepan or flame-proof casserole, add the onions and the lime or
lemon juice and fry very gently for 20 minutes, stirring frequently,
until light golden and quite dry. Remove with a slotted spoon and set
aside on a plate.

Add the pork to the residual ghee in the pan and fry over high heat
until well browned on all sides. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a
seperate plate.

Thinly slice the remaining onions. Add to the pan, with the coriander,
turmeric, fenugreek, salt and chilli powder. Fry gently for about ten
minutes until the onions are soft, then return the pork to the pan
and stir to mix with the onions. Moisten with a little water if
necessary, then cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the pork is
tender.

Add the reserved chopped onion to the pork and mix well. Continue
cooking for about 15 minutes, stirring constantly until the sauce is
thick and almost dry. Turn into a warmed serving dish and serve hot.
