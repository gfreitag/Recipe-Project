Title: DRIED APPLE PIE
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 9" pie
Double-crust pastry
-dough
3/4 lb Dried apples
4 c  Apple cider
1/4 c  Plus 1 Tbsp sugar
3 tb Cornstartch
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
2 tb Cold unsalted butter,
-cut into bits
1 tb Cold milk
1    To 3 Tbsp heavy cream
-if desired
Divide the dough into 2 slightly unequal portions, roll the larger
portion into a round 1/8 inch thick, and fit it into a 9 inch pie
plate. Roll the remaining dough into a round 1/8 thick and transfer
it to a foil-lined baking sheet.  Chill the pastry.

In a kettle combine the apples and cider, adding water if necssary to
just cover the apples, bring the cider to a boil, and simmer the
apples, covered partially, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30
minutes, or until they are softened but not mushy.  Drain the apples,
reserving 1/4 cup of the cider, and let them cool.

Into a bowl sift together 1/4 cup of the sugar, cornstartch,
cinnamon, and nutmeg, add the apples and toss the mixture. Add the
reserved cider and toss the mixture until it is combined well. Spoon
the apple mixture in the shell and dot it with the butter. Lay the
remaining pastry loosely over the filling and crimp the edges
together decoratively. Brush the pastry lightly with the milk,
sprinkle it with the remaining 1 Tbsp sugar, and cut several long
steam vents in the crust. Bake the pie on a baking sheet inteh lower
third of a preheated 425F oven for 15 minutes, reduce the heat to
400F and bake the pie for 30 minutes more. For an old-fashioned
pour-through pie, drizzle the cream into the steam vents 5 minutes
before the pie is finished baking.  Serve the pie warm with ice cream
or sharp Cheddar as an accompaniment.

This pie is a homespun American favorite.  The pour-through crust is
an old farm tradition.
