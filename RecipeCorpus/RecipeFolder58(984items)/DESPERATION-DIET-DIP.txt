Another of my recipes.  This one goes well when you're feeding people
who are ready to party, but are also trying to diet. Has a very nice
garlicky tang to it. Use it either with raw vegetables or any kind of
cracker or diet cracker.

tsp Italian seasoning Salt and pepper to taste
Â«

Mix all the ingredients together (you can even beat this mixture until
smooth if you're going to be dipping things like cauliflower in it).
Replace in the cottage cheese container. Cover and refrigerate for at
least an hour and preferably overnight. At party time, remove from
refrigerator and serve either picnic-style in the cottage cheese
container or put in a bowl for serving. Sprinkle a bit of paprika on
the top for color.
