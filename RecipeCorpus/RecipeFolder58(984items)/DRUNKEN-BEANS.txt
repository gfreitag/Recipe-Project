1    Clove garlic -- chopped

2 c  Dried pinto beans -- picked

Necessary
Preheat oven to 300 F. In a 6- to 7-quart ovenproof kettle cook bacon,
onion, oregano, and garlic over moderately high heat, stirring and
scraping up brown bits, until onion is browned lightly. Add beans,
water, jalapenos, and beer and bring to a boil. Bake mixture,
covered, in middle of oven until beans are soft, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
(Add additional water if beans begin to dry out. Mixture should be
soupy with beans very soft but not falling apart.) Stir in 2
teaspoons salt and bake beans 10 minutes more. Check seasoning,
adding remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt if necessary. Beans may be made 2
days ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered. Typos by Brenda

This dish is an excellent accompaniment to almost any Mexican meal.
The beans should be whole, perfectly tender and swimming in a
generous amount of broth. Source: Gourmet, July 1996
