Title: DRIED FRUIT CREAM SCONES
Categories: New, Text, Import
2 c  all-purpose flour
Yield: 4 Servings
1 TB baking powder
1/2 ts salt
1/4 c  sugar
3/4 c  dried apricots, -- chopped
1 1/4 c  heavy cream
Glaze:
:
3 TB butter, -- melted
2 TB sugar

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Use an ungreased baking sheet.

Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl, stirring
with a fork to mix well. Add the dried apricots. Still using a fork,
stir in the cream and mix until the dough holds together in a rough
mass (the dough will be quite sticky).

Lightly flour a board and transfer the dough to it. Knead the dough 8
or 9 times. Pat into 2 circles about 6 inches round. For the glaze,
spread the butter over the top and side of the circle of dough and
sprinkle the sugar on top. Cut each circle into 8 wedges and place
each piece on the baking sheet, allowing about an inch between pieces.

Bake for about 11 minutes, or until golden brown.

Yield: 12 scones
