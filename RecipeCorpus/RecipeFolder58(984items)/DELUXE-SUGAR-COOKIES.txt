Title: DELUXE SUGAR COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Butter or margarine
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Almond extract
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Soda
1 ts Cream of tartar
Cream butter and sugar. Add egg, vanilla, almond extract. Mix well.
Add flour, soda, and cream of tartar until smooth. Chill dough 2-3
hours. Roll out to about 1/4" thickness. Cut dough with cookie
cutters. Bake on greased cookie sheet 7-8 minutes at 375~. These
cookies are sweet and they really don't need any frosting, but they
should be sprinkled with colored sugar before baking. They are very
pretty at Christmas time. I make large stars and sprinkle half of one
star with green sugar and the other half with red sugar.
