Yield: 4 Servings

4 lg Russet potatoes
1 cl Garlic
6 tb Butter

***A diner standard, with more pizazz than hash browns. These are
cottage fried and are great accompanying any meat entree or for
breakfast with an omelette. Preheat oven 450. Peel potatoes, slice
into 1/4" thick disks. Dry between paper towels. Rub large cast-iron
(yes indeed, a well used one at that) skillet with cut edge of garlic
clove. Melt 3T butter. Add onion, toss in potatoes and saute over
high heat, 3 mins, flipping and separating to coat evenly. Arrange
disks in an overlapping pattern in pan. Dot with remaining butter,
salt, and pepper. Saute over high heat 2 mins. without stirring.
Transfer to oven, bake 30 mins or until rims of disks are golden
brown.
