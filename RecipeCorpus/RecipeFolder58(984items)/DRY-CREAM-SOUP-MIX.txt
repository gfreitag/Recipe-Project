Title: DRY CREAM SOUP MIX
Categories: Diabetic, Low fat, Newspaper, Soups
Yield: 2 Cups
1 c  Nonfat dry powdered milk
1 tb Dried onion flakes
2 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Chicken bouillon powder
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/4 ts Black pepper
Mix all the ingredients together.  Keep this calorie-saving mixture
in an airtight container until you are ready to make a cream soup.
The base can be used to make any flavor you want just by adding the
main flavoring ingredient. For cream of mushroom soup, you would add
fresh or canned mushrooms; for cream of celery soup, add some fresh,
chopped celery, etc. Just add 2 cups of cold water to the magic
mixture and put into a large saucepan.  Over medium heat, cook the
mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Add the main
ingredient and heat for a few more minutes. If it's a little too
thick, just add water to thin it or if it's too thin, add a
tablespoon or two of dry milk powder.
