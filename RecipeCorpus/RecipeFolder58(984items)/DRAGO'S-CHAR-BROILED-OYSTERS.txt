Heat coals in outdoor grill to medium-hot. Place grill rack 4 inches
above coals. If using indoor broiler, heat.

Wash and dry reserved shells well. Replace oysters in shell halves. If
broiling, place shells on baking sheet.

oysters with Parmesan cheese. Grill or broil oysters just until they
begin to puff. Remove from heat and top with chopped parsley. Serve
immediately. Klara and Drago Setanovich opened the doors of their
seafood restaurant 22 years ago, and Louisiana locals have been
crossing its threshold ever since. This popular oyster dish was added
to Drago's menu by his son, Tommy, manager of this family-run eatery.
