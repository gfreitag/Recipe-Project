Title: DINNER TONIGHT
Categories: Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
10    Sheets phyllo (oil-free)
2    Cloves garlic minced
1 ts Chopped basil (I used the
-dry kind)
1 pk Frozen spinach (the boxed
-kind)
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1 tb Parmesan (soy or FF)
-cooking spray
-pepper
5 tb Ricotta (fat-free)
5 ts Mozzarella (fat-free)
I nuked the spinach 5 minutes on high, and while it was doing, I
sauted the garlic in a skillet. When the spinach was done, I added
it, the bread crumbs, the parmesan, the pepper, and the basil. When
the water was pretty much gone, I cut the phyllo sheets in half, then
lay down one sheet, sprayed with a little spray, put down another
sheet, sprayed, until four half sheets were down. Then I took 1/5 of
the spinach mixture, then put on a tablespoon of the ricotta, and a
teaspoon of the mozzarella. Then I rolled it, sprayed it once more
lightly, then started on the next "roll." Then I baked em until they
were golden at about 350. They came out pretty good too.

Well, hey, for spontaneous cooking, I was excited. =-)
