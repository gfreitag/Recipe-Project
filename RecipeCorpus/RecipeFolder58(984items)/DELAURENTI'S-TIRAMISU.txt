flavored with about 4 TB amaretto, marsala, or any favorite lique

1.  In a bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg yolks. Gradually add
the mascarpone and continue stirring until the mixture becomes
creamy. In another bowl, whip the egg whites to a meringue
consistency (stiff peaks). Carefully fold the meringue into the
mascarpone mixture.

2.  Quickly and lightly dip enough ladyfingers or biscuits into the
brewed espresso to line the bottom of an 8-by-8-inch pan or glass
serving dish. Cover the ladyfingers or biscuits with one half of the
mascarpone mixture, followed by a thorough dusting of cocoa and
shaving of chocolate. Repeat the layering process. (If you prefer a
less moist dessert, you can divide the layers into thirds, or dip
your ladyfingers even faster....)

3.  Once assembled, shake the pan lightly to settle the ingredients.
Chill at least two hours (overnight is preferable) before serving.
Cut into portions and serve.
