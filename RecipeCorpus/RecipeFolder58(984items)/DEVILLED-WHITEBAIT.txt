Title: DEVILLED WHITEBAIT
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
3 tb Flour
2 ts Cayenne pepper
Salt to taste
600 g  Whitefish
Heat oil for deep-frying. Put 3 tablespoons plain flour in a paper or
plastic bag and add 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper and salt to taste.

In batches, put the whitebait (600 g in total) into the bag and shake
until they are coated with seasoned flour. Shake off excess flour,
then deep-fry for 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain well
on kitchen paper.

When all the whitebait have been cooked, put them back into the frying
basket, reheat the oil and plunge the basket back into the hot oil for
another couple of minutes until they are golden. (Depending on the
capacity of your deep-fryer, you may have to do the second cooking in
batches as well.) Drain and turn out into a serving dish lined
thickly with paper napkins. Serve with wedges 6 of lemon.
