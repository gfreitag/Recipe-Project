1 lb Milkcote coating
In the top of a double boiler, melt milkcote over hot, not boiling
water. Paint sides and bottoms of candy cups or small baking cups
with melted coating, using a good quality 1-inch brush. Freeze until
firm. Remove from freezer and fill to within 1/16-inch from the top
with dietetic jellies, peanut butter filling, nut meats, raisins, or
any filling a diabetic may eat. Add milkcote to cover top and seal
edges. Chill again until top is firm.  Store candies in their paper
cups. Source: Ideals Candy Cookbook by Mildred Brand
