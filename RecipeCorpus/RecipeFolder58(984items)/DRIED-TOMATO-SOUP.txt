Title: DRIED TOMATO SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
4    Garlic cloves, large
2 sm Onions, sliced
1 ts Basil, dried
1 ts Oregano, dried
1/2 ts Rosemary, dried
1/4 ts Ginger
12    Dried tomato slices, 4in
Diameter
6 c  Water
1 pn Salt
Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium heat. Slice the garlic
in fairly large pieces and add to the oil, add the sliced tomatoes.
Saute on mediun heat until soft. Add the herbs and ginger. Saute for
a minute or 2 longer. Add a little water if it gets to dry. Add
enough hot water to fill the pot, 4-6 cups worth. Cover, bring to a
boil, reduce to a simmer. Keep covered stirring occasionally to
prevent sticking. Taste and add a little pinch of salt if you think
it's needed 10 minutes or so before serving. I left this simmering
for about 3 hours. I imagine it would be ready anywhere after about
half an hour.

This made a lovely brothy tomato soup.

All the herbs were whole dried. I crumbled them into the pot as the
onion and garlic were cooking. All the ingredients except for the
garlic, olive oil, ginger and water were homegrown and dried. Don't
know if this will taste as good with store bought stuff. The dried
tomatoes had no seasoning or oil on them.
