Revised to add soup bases and red pepper flakes 02/11/96 A revised
recipe for my crockpot beans and ham. I used home grown horticulture
beans, added beef and chicken soup base, and red pepper flakes to
spice them up a bit. Got such raves from the family I decided I
better revise the recipe while I still remembered what changes I made
to it. Also decided to try soaking the beans overnight in baking soda
water in an attempt to avoid the usual gassiness. Seems to have
worked quite well, the beans were quite tender without being mushy.
