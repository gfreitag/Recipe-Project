=========================== > Directions < =========================

Cook the pasta according to package directions.

In a large skillet or sauce pan: Heat the Olive Oil and the Sherry
Pepper Oil. Add and Saute the Oregano, Onions and Shallots until
almost translucent before adding the garlic and walnuts. Add the
walnuts and garlic. Saute, without letting the garlic brown. Add the
crushed Tomatoes and Burgundy wine and Basil. Cook slowly over a low
heat, uncovered.

In a microwave oven: Cover and cook the julienned Red Pepper for 1
minute. Set aside. Cover and cook the julienned Zucchini for 2 to 3
minutes. Set aside. The Red Peppers and Zucchini will maintain their
pretty coloring by cooking "al dente" in the microwave.

When the tomato sauce has been reduced and is the consistency
desired, add the Red Peppers and Zucchini.

Heat the Broiler.

Drain the cooked pasta.  (Because water can cling to the insides of
these little "macaroni pipes", I give the pasta a few spins in my
Lettuce Spinner.)  Add the pasta to the tomato sauce and toss.

Taste the sauce, adding salt and Crushed Red Pepper Flakes as desired.

Transfer the Pasta and Sauce to a oven proof serving dish. Liberally,
sprinkle shredded Mozzarella Cheese on top of the Pasta mixture. Place
under the broiler until the cheese melts. Remove from the oven and
garnish with the Basil florets and leaves.
