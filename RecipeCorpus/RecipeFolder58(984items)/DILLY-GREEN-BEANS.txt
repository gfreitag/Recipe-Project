Title: DILLY GREEN BEANS
Categories: Pickles, Vegetables, Appetizers, Canning
Yield: 7 Pint jars
4 lb Table perfect whole green
-beans
1 3/4 ts Crushed dried HOT red pepper
3 1/2 ts Dried dill seed, OR 7 fresh
-dill heads
7    Cloves fresh garlic
5 c  Vinegar
5 c  Water
1 c  Less 1 tablespoon pickling
-salt (non-iodized)
Wash beans thoroughly, remove stems and tips, and cut them as much as
possible in uniform lengths to allow them to stand upright in 1-pint
canning jars, coming to the shoulder of the jar.  Have jars clean and
very hot, and lids and sealers ready in scalding water.  In each jar
place 1 dill head or 1/2 teaspoon dill seed, add 1 garlic clove and
1/4 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper.  Pack beans upright in jars,
leaving 1 inch of headroom.  Heat together the water. vinegar and
salt; when the mixture boils, pour it over the beans, filling each
jar to 1/2 inch from the top. Run a plastic knife down and around to
remove trapped air, adjust lids, and process in a 185F. bath for 10
minutes after the water in the canner returns to a simmer.  Remove
jars, complete seals if necessary.

The beans are almost garden-crisp, but the high acidity of the vinegar
allows this boiling-water bath to be safe for a low acid food.

If you substitute ground cayenne pepper for the crushed hot red
pepper, halve the amount of cayenne: use only 1/8 teaspoon cayenne to
each jar.

Wait at least two weeks for these beans to develop their flavor.

NOTE:  I prefer to put in one whole dried or fresh (preferably)
serrano or Cayenne type pepper.  It will not make the beans too
spicy, but will add a delightful tang, much as commercial pickled
"hot" okra, which is not really hot to my leather palate.  JMH
