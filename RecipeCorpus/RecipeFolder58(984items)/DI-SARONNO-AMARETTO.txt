: Here's a recipe that was originally written to appear in More Top
Secret recipes, but never made it into the final version. Now, at
last, I can share it with you. This is a great recipe to have if you
like Amaretto, since it's sooo much cheaper to make your own version
at home. Just get the cheapest Vodka you can find and have an empty
bottle on hand to store the stuff in.
