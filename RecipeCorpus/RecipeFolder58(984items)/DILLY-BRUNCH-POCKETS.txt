Categories: Mexican, Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Eggs/cheese, Jaw
Yield: 6 Servings
12    Corn tortillas
1    Large tomato, seeded and
Chopped
1/4 c  Plus 2T sliced green onion
1 ts Chopped fresh dill OR
1/4 ts Dried dill
1 tb Margarine
6    Eggs, slightly beaten
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Pkg. Canadian Bacon (5 to 6
Ounces) or 12 thin slices
Folded in half
1 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
To warm and fold corn tortillas, briefly cook each tortilla on both
sides in a nonstick skillet, about 1 minute (do not overcook) and
fold in quarters.  Keep prepared tortillas covered with cloth towel
until all tortillas are folded and ready to be filled.

In 10 inch nonstick skillet, briefly saute tomato and 1/4 cup green
onions with dill in margarine.  Add beaten eggs, salt and pepper to
taste. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until eggs
are just cooked, but still soft.  Remove from heat.

To fill each tortilla, place one slice of Canadian bacon in one
"pocket" of folded tortilla; fill second "pocket" with about 2
tablespoons egg mixture. As each tortilla is filled, arrange
overlapping in shallow 12x8x2 inch baking dish (lightly brushed with
margarine or spaayed with nonstick cooking spray). Sprinkle with
cheese, if desired, and remaining 2 tablespoons chopped green onion.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until just heated through.
