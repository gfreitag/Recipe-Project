Title: DEER MARINADE IV
Categories: Wildgame, Spices
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Wine, dry white, bottle
1 c  Vinegar
1/2 c  Oil, any type
1    Onion, large, sliced
2    Carrots, large, sliced thin
4    Shallots, chopped
3    Parsley, chopped, sprigs
1 ts Salt
6    Peppercorns, crushed
4    Juniper berries
1/4 ts Thyme
Place cutup and chopped vegetables around meat in a large bowl. Pour
mixed liquids over it. Oil rises to the top and retains flavor of
marinade. Use for 2 hours to 48 hours, dependent on how you assess
the tenderness and flavor of the meat. Retain marinade liquid for
soup base, gravies or reuse later. Keep meat in refrigerator if not
cooking the same day. OPTIONS: Omit juniper berries. Add rosemary or
tarragon with or in place of thyme. Recipe date: 01/15/63
