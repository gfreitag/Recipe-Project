Title: DENDENG PEDAS ('HOT' FRIED BEEF)
Categories: Indonesian, Beef, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 6 Servings
1 kg (2 lb) topside (beef)
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 tb Dark soya sauce
MMMMM---------------------------BUMBU--------------------------------
10    Shallots
4    Red chillis (or 2 tbs
-Sambal Ulek)
2 tb Vegetable oil
Salt
1 tb Lemon or fresh lime juice
* Cut the beef fairly thin and trim it into small, square pieces.
Marinate it for 1 hour or longer. Remember that pedas=hot++spicy hot!
This is fried beef, with a robust flavour of chilli. Slice the
shallots finely. Seed and slice the chillis.  Fry them in a
tablespoonful of oil, in a wok, stirring all the time until they are
golden brown. Add salt to taste. Keep hot. Put a tablespoonful of oil
in a thick frying-pan, and fry the slices of meat a few at a time.
Three minutes on each side will be ample*. When all the pieces are
cooked, put them into the wok with the shallots and chilli. Heat, and
mix well.  Sprinkle over the mixture 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,
or, better still, fresh lime juice. Stir, and add more salt if
necessary.  Serve hot, with rice. * NOTE: In Indonesia, the meat is
usually fried until crisp.  You can even buy sun-dried dendeng which
only needs coating with bumbu and frying. Crisp dendeng can be rather
tough, and I prefer it as described above; however, a purist might
say that my recipe is not 'genuinely' Indonesian. Makes 6 servings.
