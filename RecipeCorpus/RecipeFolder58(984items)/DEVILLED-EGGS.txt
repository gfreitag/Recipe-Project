1 lb Tomatoes, skinned and choppd
Or2 x 14oz tined, chopped
Juice of 1/2 a lemon
1 tb White wine vinegar

Hot, spicy sauces - devils - were popular in Britain in the 19th
century. This sauce is served with poached eggs but goes equally well
with fried eggs. The sauce can be made the night before and kept
covered in the fridge. Warm through just before serving. An egg
poacher can be used.

Fry the onion in the butter for 3 mins. Add the tomatoes, lemon
juice, half the vinegar, the tomato puree, Worcestershire sauce,
brown sugar, stock, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to
the boil and simmer gently for 20 mins until fairly thick. Keep the
sauce warm.

Lightly toast and butter the crumpets or muffins, and keep them warm.

Half fill a deep frying pan with water. Add the rest of the vinegar,
and bring to a gentle rolling boil. One at a time, crack each egg
into a cup, and slide the egg into the bubbling water. Poach the eggs
for 3 mins. Using two spoons, gather in the egg whites as they start
to set, to give each egg a neat shape.

Lift out the cooked eggs and drain on kitchen paper. Put each crumpet
or muffin on a plate, and top with an egg. Spoon over the hot sauce,
and serve immediately.
