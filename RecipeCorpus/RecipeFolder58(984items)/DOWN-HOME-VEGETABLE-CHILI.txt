Preparation time: 25 minutes.  Cooking time: 1 hour. Yield: 9 1/2
cups.

1.  Heat oil in 3-quart non-aluminum saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add garlic, onion, carrots and  1/2 cup of the zucchini. Cook,
stirring often, until onion is softened, about 4 minutes. Add kidney
beans, tomatoes and their liquid, tomato paste, beef broth, 1 1/2
cups water, brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, oregano and salt. Stir
until combined. Simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, 40 minutes.

2.  Add remaining zucchini, bulgur wheat and corn kernels. Simmer 10
minutes more.  Add remaining  1/2 cup water as necessary. Taste and
adjust seasoning. Serve hot. Pass light sour cream or low-fat yogurt,
sliced green onions and cilantro leaves separately. Note: This is a
highly flavorful, crunchy and substantial chili. As with most chilis,
it's best made at least a day ahead so the flavors fully develop. Can
be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen as long as 3
months. Reheat gently, adjusting water and seasoning as needed.
