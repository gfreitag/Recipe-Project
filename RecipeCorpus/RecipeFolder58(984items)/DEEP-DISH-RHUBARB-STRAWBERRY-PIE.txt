MMMMM----------------------FLAKY PASTRY II---------------------------
1 1/2 c  Flour, sifted
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Vegetable shortening
4 tb ;Water, cold, approx
Sift flour and salt into a medium bowl; cut in shortening with a fork
or pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle cold water over
mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time; mix lightly with a fork just until
pastry holds together and leaves sides of bowl clean. Make a ball;
flatten it. Wrap dough in plastic and store in refrigerator until
ready for use.

Mix sugar, flour, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl.

Wash rhubarb; trim ends; cut into 1-inch pieces (You should have 6
cups). Wash strawberries; hull and halve (you should have 4 cups).
Place both in a large bowl. Sprinkle with sugar mixture; toss lightly
to mix. Let stand 15 minutes.  Toss again.

Spoon rhubarb-strawberry filling into an 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking dish;
dot with butter or margarine.

Prepare pastry.  Roll out to a 10-inch square on a lightly floured
surface. Cut in 1/2-inch strips with a pastry wheel or knife. Weave
strips into a lattice. Cover filling. Turn ends under just enough so
that strips touch sides of baking dish.  Brush lattice top with milk
or cream; sprinkle with sugar.

Bake in hot oven (425 F) for 40 minutes, or until pastry is golden and
juices bubble up.  Cool.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream, if you
wish.
