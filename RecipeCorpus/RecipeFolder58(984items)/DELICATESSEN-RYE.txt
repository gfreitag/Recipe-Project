Categories: Breadmaker, Sourdough
Yield: 1 Large loaf
-TMPS67B    CLAUDIA WOODARD
2 1/4 ts Yeast
2 2/3 c  Bread flour ]
1 c  Rye flour; plus 2 Tbsp
2 1/4 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt

This bread really does taste just like deli rye.
Follow your machine's instructions. It's such a good sourdough, you
may have to cut back on the yeast. I made a loaf this morning and cut
the yeast back from 2 tsp. to 1 1/2 tsp. and it still spilled over
the pan.
