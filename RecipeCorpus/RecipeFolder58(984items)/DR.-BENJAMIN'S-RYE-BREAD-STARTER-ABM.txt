Title: DR. BENJAMIN'S RYE BREAD STARTER ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 ts Yeast
2 c  Water
2 c  Rye flour
1 sm Onions
1 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Rye flour
Sprinkle yeast over tepid water.  Beat in flour till no lumps remain.
Peel and halve onion; add to starter. Cover loosely with cloth & let
stand at room temp for
24    hrs.

Remove onion.  Beat in tepid water & flour.  Cover with cloth and let
stand for 24 hrs more.  The starter should now be pleasingly
sour-smelling, almost beery and bubbly.

Feed once a week with 1/2 c tepid water & 3/4 c rye flour and leave
out overnight.  Otherwise keep in fridge. (Good idea to feed the day
before you're going to use it.)
