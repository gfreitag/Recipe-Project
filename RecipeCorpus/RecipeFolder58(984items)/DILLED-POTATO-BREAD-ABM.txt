Title: DILLED POTATO BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
1/2 tb Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
3 tb Wheat germ
3 tb Powdered milk
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Dill seed
2 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Oil
1    Eggs
1 1/4 c  Water
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Leftover or just cooked and mashed potatoes give this bread a soft
texture and tangy, almost sourdough taste. The loaf is very good with
pot roast or roast beef, meat loaf, vegetable soups, and chowders.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments:
