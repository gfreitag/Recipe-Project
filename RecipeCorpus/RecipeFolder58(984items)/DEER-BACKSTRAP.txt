Title: DEER BACKSTRAP
Categories: Wild, Game
1    whole venison backstrap
Yield: 3 Servings
1/2 lb bacon slices
1 TB salt
1 TB black pepper
1 ts garlic powder

An easy recipe for venison backstrap is to cut it lengthwise into 3
equal strips. Season to taste (we use salt, pepper and garlic powder)
then roll each strip up, circle with a slice of bacon and secure with
a toothpick. What you should have will look like a filet mignon and
after you grill it rare over coals will taste twice as good.
