Title: DELICIOUS CHICKEN WITH POBLANO SAUCE
Categories: Chiles, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Chicken breasts cut in
Half with no bones
1/2    Onions
1 cl Garlic
1 c  Cream
5    Poblano chiles
250 g  Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tb Instant Coffee
1 tb Vinegar
Instructions

Cook the chicken in medium pot with water, the onions, garlic and
salt. 2. Place the chiles directly over the stove's grill and let
them roast until they start to become black on both sides.
Inmediately introduce the chiles in plastic bag and let them sweat
for five minutes. 3. Now make an incision in the chiles, only large
enough to take out all the veins and peel them so that all the burnt
skin is off and they are green again. 4. Put the chiles in a small
bowl with water, one teaspoon of soluble coffee and one tablespoon of
vinegar. Let them sit for 1/2 hour to 1 hour. This extracts the
capsine from the chile, reducing its hotness and making the more
tasty. 5. Drain the chiles and rinse in water. Next, put in blender
along with the cream, salt and pepper. 6. Put the chicken breast in a
heat resistant container and pour the strained Poblano sauce.
Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and dot with butter. 7. Bake for
20 minutes aprox. at 200 degrees Celsius. Walt
