This is from Deborah Madison's "The Savory Way" (Bantam, 1990). When
the cake cools, slice it horizontally and spread it with raspberry
jelly or whole, sugared raspberries. Replace the top and dust with
powdered sugar.

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325F. Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan.
Combine the almond paste and the sugar in a food processor and work
until well blended. Add the butter and continue to process until
blended; then add the eggs, one at a time, the sour cream and the
flavorings. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Sift the flour
with the baking powder, soda and salt. Add it to the batter a third
at a time, gently stirring in each cupful. Turn the batter into the
baking pan and bake the cake in the middle of the oven until the cake
is golden on top and springy to the touch, about 1 hour. Remove the
cake from the oven and let it stand to cool slightly; then turn it
out onto a serving plate. When cool, dust it with sifted powdered
sugar. This cake will keep well, wrapped tightly for several days.
Makes 1 large cake.
