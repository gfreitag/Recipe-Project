Title: DRINKING CUSTARD
Categories: Desserts, Beverages, Kump
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pt Milk
1 pt Heavy cream
1 c  Sugar
12    Egg yolks
1 tb Flour
Eggnog is essentially a dessert sauce called creme anglaise. The
addition of flour to this recipe is unorthodox but it enables you to
boil the sauce without curdling it.

HEAT MILK, CREAM AND SUGAR in a saucepan and bring just to a boil.
(Do not stir--leaving the sugar on the bottom of the pot will prevent
the milk from scorching.) Beat the egg yolks and flour together with
a wire whisk. Add about a cup of the hot milk mixture to the yolks
and whisk to blend. Then whisk the yolk mixture into the mixture in
the saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil gently for
10 seconds, then remove from heat and strain into a bowl, discarding
the flour lumps. Chill and serve with rum, if desired.
