Title: DIABETIC STRAWBERRY/BANANA MILKSHAKE
Categories: Beverages, Low-cal, Diabetic
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Frozen whole strawberries
1    Ripe banana
1 c  Milk (skim and low fat work
Fine)
4 pk Sugar substitute (or more to
Taste)
1/2 ts Vanilla
Place all ingredients in a blender and run the blender on the highest
setting.  The shake will take longer in the blender than most people
will expect because of the frozen strawberries. However, the frozen
berries along with the banana provide the smooth thickness of this
drink. Remember, this recipe is not a scientific formula. The
quantities of each ingredient are very flexible, experiment until you
find your favorite.
