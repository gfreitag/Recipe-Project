Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/4 ts Salt

Combine all ingredients in a jar.  Tighten lid and shake until

"This is a simple flavor enhancer", Remus tells me. "It's thin enough
to read today's headlines through....but not so thin that a
politician can." Remus Assures me that this authentic sauce can be
used as a mop during cooking and as a dip after your meat has been
taken off the grill.
