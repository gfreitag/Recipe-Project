Title: DRAMBUIE TYPE LIQUEUR
Categories: Liqueurs
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Scotch whiskey
2 c  Orange honey
3 1/2 tb Coriander seeds
First of all, if you can't find orange honey, just add 1 T grated
orange peel to regular honey. Combine ingredients and shake until
honey is dissolved. Cover, leave to mature for at least 4 weeks. You
may have to experiment a little with this recipe because the quality
and flavor of the honey will vary from region to region. The batches
I have made taste better than the $40. fifth you can buy at the
liquor store.
