*********************** Melt 2 squares (1 oz each) unsweetened
chocolate and 1 aquare semi-sweet chocolate with 2 tablespoons butter
over low heat. Heat 3 tablespoons kahlua and 2 tablespoons heavy
cream together. Combine chocolate and kahlua mixtures with 2 cups
powdered sugar (free from lumps).  Beat until well blended and thick.

spreading consistency. Frost brownies immediately as mixture stiffens
upon setting. Posted by Kay Mainguth in Fidonet Cooking, 5/18/92.
