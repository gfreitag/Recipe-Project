Title: DERBY SAGE PARSNIPS(ENGLISH)
Categories: English
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Parsnips
3 oz Flour
1 1/2 oz Derby sage cheese
Finely grated
Salt and pepper
2 tb Dripping
Set oven to 400/F or Mark 6. Mix the flour   , cheese, salt and
pepper in a mixing bowl. Peel the parsnips and cut into small chunks.
Place the parsnips in a pan of boiling, salted water and bring back
to the boil. Cover and cook for 3 minutes. Drain the parsnips and,
while hot, drop a few at a time into the cheese mixture. Shake the
bowl to ensure a good even coating, then transfer to a tray. Place
the dripping in a roasting tin and heat in the oven. When hot, remove
the tin from oven and place in it the coated parsnips. Spoon the hot
fat over the parsnips, return to the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes,
turning over after 20 minutes. The cheese mixture will  only coat the
parsnips while they are steaming. To keep them `steamy', drain only a
few at a time.
