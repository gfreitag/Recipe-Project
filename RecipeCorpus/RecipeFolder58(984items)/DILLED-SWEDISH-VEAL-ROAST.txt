cut lengthwise into quarters.) Sprinkle with chopped dill and white
pepper. Pour in lemon juice and wine.  Cover and cook at low setting

Carefully lift veal to a warm deep platter. Using a slotted spoon,
lift carrots and mushrooms from cooker and arrange around veal; keep

cooker. Increase cooker heat setting to high; cover and cook,
stirring 2 or 3 times until suace is thickened. (15-20 more minutes).

To serve, remove and discard strings from veal. Slice across the
grain. Spoon some of the sauce over veal and vegetables; if desired,
garanish with lemon peel and dill sprigs. Serve remaining sauce in a
bowl or pitcher to add taste.
