******************
* THE BIG DIPPER *
****************** Just as the right wine can make a
meal, the ultimate success of a dip is dependent upon the dipper.
Each recipe in each of the files contains the recommended pairings
that will do your dips proud.
The possibilities are endless, limited only by your ingenuity and
your taste buds.  To help you get started, I have included this file
and a few recipes and suggestions for dippers.
*********
* CHIPS *
********* The age-old standard-bearers of dipping,
chips are the frontline soldiers traditionally thrust forward by those
armies of outstretched arms advancing on the dip table.
While I fell that it would be somewhat disrespectful to disparage the
troops that have seen the most action (and hence the recipes for
homemade potato chips and tortilla chips), one need not be limited by
tradition. You will also find recipes for preparing a number of novel
variations, including elephant garlic chips, butterflake biscuit
chips, noodle chips, and potato skins. You may also want to try
toasted bagel chips. Just cut a bagel into slices, as thin as
possible, and toast them until golden brown.
EASY-TO-MAKE HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS: Scrub 6 to 7 medium potatoes
(about 2 pounds) under cold running water and peel, if desired. Slice
the potatoes as thinly as possible, (thin enough to see through). As
you proceed, place the slices in a bowl of cold water to remove the
starch. The water will turn white.  Drain and refill the bowl,
repeating this until the water remains clear.  Drain and let the
potatoes dry.
Fill a heavy skillet or saucepan halfway with vegetable oil or melted
vegetable shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil crackles.
Place the potato slice into the hot oil, a few at a time being
careful not to overcrowd the pan.  When the potatoes are brown on
both sides, 4 to 6 minutes, remove from the pan and drain on paper
towels. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.
Makes about 180 chips, or enough for about 3 cups of dip.
******************
* Tortilla Chips *
****************** These dippers can be made
from either flour or corn tortillas. Corn tortillas are the more
familiar breed, from which the dippers served with salsa in Mexican
restaurants are made. Cut them into either triangular chips or small
strips. Fried flour tortillas will hold up better in the larger chip
form, have a stronger, deep fried taste, more like a toastada.
Cut the tortilla into thin strips (12 to 16 per tortilla) or into
triangles (8 per tortilla).
Fill a heavy skillet halfway with vegetable oil or melted vegetable
shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil crackles. Put the
tortilla strips or triangles into the hot oil a few at a time. Watch
carefully, as they fry very quickly (about 30 seconds). When brown on
both sides, remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.
10 whole tortillas make enough chips for about 1 1/2 cups of dip.
EDIBLE TORTILLA BASKETS: A tortilla basket will lend flair to your
dip table and set off a Mexican dip nicely. Fill a heavy skillet
halfway with vegetable oil or melted vegetable shortening and cook
over medium heat until the oil crackles. Have read an empty 1-lb
coffee can (washed, free of grounds and very thoroughly dried).
Place the tortilla in the hot oil, being careful of spattering.
Protecting your hand with an oven mitt, grasp the coffee can with
tongs, position it over the center of the submerged tortilla, and
lower onto the tortilla. Continue to hold down until the tortilla
turns golden brown and begins to rise up around the coffee can,
forming a tulip shape (about 2 to 3 minutes.  Put the hot coffee can
aside and remove the tortilla basket from the oil and drain.  Cool to
room temperature before using.
