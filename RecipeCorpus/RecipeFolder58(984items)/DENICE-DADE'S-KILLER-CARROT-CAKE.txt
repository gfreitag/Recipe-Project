Title: DENICE DADE'S KILLER CARROT CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 c  Vegetable oil *
2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs, slighlty beaten
2 c  Raw, grated carrots
1 c  Diced peaches or pineapple
1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
8 oz Cream cheese, softened
1 lb Box confectioner's sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
12 tb Butter/margarine
1.  Cake:  Sift together dry ingredients.  Add the rest of the cake
ingredients and mix well.  Pour into greased bundt or 9x13 pan and
bake at 325 degrees F for 30 mintues to 1 hour (depends on how much
liquid is in your fruit), or until cake springs back from finger when
lightly pressed on top.  Cool completely prior to frosting.

2.  Frosting:  Cream together all frosting ingredients and spread over
cooled cake.

*  To lower the fat in the recipe, I often replace 1/2 to 3/4 cup of
the oil with the juice left over from the peaches or pineapple (I use
canned). It turns out fine. I have also used lowfat cream cheese in
the frosting with success...it's just slightly less firm.
