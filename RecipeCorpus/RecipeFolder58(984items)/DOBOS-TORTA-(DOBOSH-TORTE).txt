To prepares the cake: Butter and flour baking sheets to accomodate six
layers. Using a plate as a guide, mark an 8 inch circle on baking
sheets for each layer. While you can rotate the baking sheets, they
must be rebuttered and floured for each layer. Preheat the oven to
375 degrees. Sift the flour with the salt and beat the eggs with the
electric mixer and add the sugar gradually. Fold in the flour, taking
care not to overmix. Divide the mixture into six portions and spread
each portion on the marked circles. Bake for 6-8 minutes or until the
eges are very lightly browned. Trim the edge of each circle with a
knie and lift the cake onto a wire cooling rack. Put aside 1 circle
on alightly oiled baking pan. This will be covered with caramel to
make the top layer of the finished cake. To prepare the butter cream,
put the sugar and water in a small heavy saucepan and cook until the
mixture reaches 218 degrees on a candy thermometer. Add the syrup to
the lightly beaten egg yolks and beat in the butter a little at a
timeed cake layer. Cover the sides with butter cream. Press the
grated chocolate against the sides of the cake. Deocrate the top of
the caramelized layer with piped butter cream. Leave the cake to
season for 6 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Dobos Torta -
