Categories: Turkey, Alcohol, Holiday, Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
12 lb Turkey
2 lb Mixed dried fruit
1 c  Golden raisins
4 ea Granny Smith apples,
4 ea Oranges, juice from
1 cn (92.5 oz) chiles chipotles
3 c  Tequila
3 c  Grand Marnier
2 ea Sticks unsalted butter
-cut into 1-inch wedges
Preheat oven to 325~F. Rinse turkey and pat dry inside and out. Set
aside. Combine dried fruit, raisins, and apples in a medium-size
bowl. Put orange juice and chiles (with sauce that clings to them)
into a blender or food processor and process for 1 minute. Add 1 cup
each of tequila and Grand Marnier, then pour the mixture over the
fruit and let rest 15 minutes. Drain the fruit, reserving the liquid.
Cut half the butter into 1/2-inch pieces and combine with the fruit.
Stuff cavity of the turkey with most of the fruit. Place the turkey
in a roasting bag, arrange remaining fruit on top of the bird and
pour reserved orange juice-liquor mix over it. Combine remaining
tequila and Grand Marnier. Have ready a basting syringe fitted with a
metal injection nozzle and inject the mixture all over the turkey.
Melt remaining butter and carefully pour over the turkey in the
roasting bag. Seal bag and cut 1/4-inch slit on the top to let steam
escape. Place in a roasting pan and roast for 2 1/2 hours. Every 30
minutes open bag (being careful to shield your face from steam) and
inject more liquor, eventually using it up. When ready to serve, slit
open bag, arrange turkey on a platter, and scoop out the fruit
stuffing. Place all the fruit in a serving bowl. Strain the juices
that have accumulated in the bag, skim off any fat, and serve in a
gravy boat. Serves 8 to 10
