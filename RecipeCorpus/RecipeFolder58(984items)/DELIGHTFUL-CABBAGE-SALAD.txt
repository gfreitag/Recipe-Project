I was just given this recipe about two months ago and have taken it to
about six different events and the response is incredible. Even
children like it, because it is crunchy and sweet. We sometimes have
it all alone with homemade bread for dinner.  This recipe will
surprise you!!!!!!

I make it up in "triplicate" for luncheons and parties, however, you
do not need to "triple" the oil...I only use 1/2 cup of oil for a
triple recipe. GET READY FOR LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS AND REQUESTS FOR
THIS ONE!!!!
