2 c  Flour
1 c  Salt
1 c  Water
Combine flour and salt in large, flat bottomed bowl.
Add a little water at a time, mixing as you pour to form a ball.
Knead for 7 - 10 minutes until dough has a smooth, firm consistency.
Add small amounts of water if necessary. Keep in plastic bag to
prevent drying.
When ready to use, flour hands and work space to keep the dough from
sticking.  Roll out to cut shapes or form into desired shapes with
hands. Join pieces together by moistening both surfaces with water
and pressing together. Either let air dry for 48 hours, longer if
they are thick or bake at 325 - 350 deg until surface turns light
golden brown. The last step is to paint with acrylic paints, enamels,
clear acrylic or varnish to seal out moisture. NOT EDIBLE, but not
toxic.
