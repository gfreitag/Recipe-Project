Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2    To 3 cup all purpose flour
2 c  Rye flour
2 pk Fast acting yeast
2 c  Whole bran cereal
1 tb Salt
1 tb Caraway seeds
2 ts Onion powder
1 1/2 c  Milk

In large mixer bowl, combine 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup rye flour,
yeast, bran cereal, salt, caraway seed and onion powder; mix well. In
saucepan, heat milk, 1/2 cup water, molasses, oil and chocolate until
very warm (125-130 degrees; chocolate does not need to melt). Add to
flour mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at
medium speed.

By hand, gradually stir in remaining rye flour and enough remaining
all purpose flour to make a firm dough. Knead on floured surface
until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl,
turning to grease top.

COver, let rise in warm place until double, 30-45 minutes. Punch down
dough.

Divide into 2 parts. On lightly floured surface, shape each half into
a round loaf. Place in greased 8 inch layer cake pans. Cover; let
rise in warm place until almost doubled, about 15 minutes. Bake at
375 degrees for 40-45 minutes. Combine 1/4 cup water and cornstarch
for glaze in small saucepan; heat to boiling. Brush on loaves 5
minutes before end of baking. Sprinkle caraway seeds on loaves, if
desired. Return loaves to oven for 5 minutes or until glaze is glossy
and loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove from pans when cool.
