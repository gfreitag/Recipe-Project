This simple little Turkish ice can be served as a dessert or as a
palate-cleansing between-courses Sorbet. You don't need an ice-cream
machine to make it.

In a saucepan, make a syrup with 2 cups water and 1 cup sugar. Stir
over heat until the sugar dissolves, then add the juice of half a
lemon and boil the syrup vigorously for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.

In a food processor, puree 3 punnets of hulled, strawberries with
quarter of a cup of milk and a couple of drops of red food colouring.
Combine puree with the syrup and pour into a narrow rectangular cake
tin or a freezer tray and freeze.

To serve, break up the strawberry ice with a fork and spoon it into
chilled dishes or glasses.  Serve immediately.

Makes 6 servings.
