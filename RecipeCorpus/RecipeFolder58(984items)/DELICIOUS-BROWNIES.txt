Title: DELICIOUS BROWNIES
Categories: Brownies, Chocolate, Nuts
Yield: 12 Servings
1    Double Fudge Brownie Mix
6 oz Nestles chocolate chips
4 oz Almonds; sliced
In a 9x13 pan, sprinkle the chocolate chips and nuts over the prepared
Brownie Mix and cook according to package directions. Be careful not
to overcook; if anything, "undercook" and then let them cool for at
least an hour before you cut them in 2" squares (or 3" to be really
impressive). And if anyone asks you where you got the recipe, just
smile and say it's a secret.
