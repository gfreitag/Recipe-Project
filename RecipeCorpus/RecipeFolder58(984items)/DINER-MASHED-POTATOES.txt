Title: DINER MASHED POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes, Mash
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM------------------------SQUARE MEALS-----------------------------
6    Russet potatoes
6 tb Sweet butter
Salt and pepper
3/4 c  Warmed milk
***These are indeed hand mashed, not whipped or riced. Potatoes should
never be allowed to cool once they are put into the pot to cook.
Always have the milk warmed. Prepare them right before serving so
they're piping hot. Don't cut the potatoes too small prior to
cooking, they'll be mushy. Peel potatoes, and boil until tender.
Drain, return to pot over med heat, tossing and stirring until all
moisture is gone. Mash with a masher, adding butter and salt when
they are clear of lumps. While mixing vigorously with a heavy whisk,
add warm milk. The more you beat, the fluffier they will be. Serve
immediately, garnished with pepper and pats of butter. Note: if they
are to accompany Diner Meatloaf, serve potatoes with an ice cream
scoop. Plop a scoopful on the plate next to the meat, then flip the
scoop over and use its rounded surface to indent a crater in the top
of the potato globe. Hence the name, Crater Potatoes. The crater is
for the gravy.
