Title: DOUBLE BROWNIES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM----------------------CHOCOLATE LAYER---------------------------
2    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 c  Cocoa
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
MMMMM---------------------BUTTERSCOTCH LAYER--------------------------
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
2    Eggs
2 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
Chocolate layer first 2 eggs 1 cup sugar 3/4 cup flour 1/2 cup chopped
walnuts 1/8 tsp salt 1/4 cup cocoa 1/2 cup butter or margarine

Beat  2 eggs 'til foamy.  Add sugar, flour, nuts, and salt. Melt
cocoa and butter together in saucepan. Add to egg mixture and blend
well. Spread in greased 9 x 13 pan. Set aside. Butterscotch layer next

1/2 cup butter or margarine 1 1/2 cups brown sugar 2 eggs 2 tsp
vanilla 1 1/2 cups flour 1/4 tsp salt 1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Cream butter and brown sugar.  Add eggs and vanilla. Beat until well
mixed. Add flour, salt, and nuts. Spoon over chocolate layer in small
blobs, and spread as best you can.

Bake at 350 F (or 180 C) for 30 minutes 'til brownies begin to pull
away from pan. Note: I usually do it opposite so that I can use one
bowl, and they're just as yummy. My family hates walnuts, so I never
get to taste them in these, though I bet they would be *wonderful*
(poor Mom ~- she's always sacrificing -- can't you just hear those
violins playin'...).

I bet just the butterscotch part would be yummy baked in a 9 x 9 or 8
x 8 pan.  I'm going to go home and try it (maybe *with* walnuts)
because that's my favorite part.
