Title: DOLMA ICI ZEYTINYAGLI (RICE STUFFING FOR VEGE
Categories: Ethnic, Vegetarian, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb Long grained rice
1/2 c  Olive oil
1 c  Water
1 lg Tomato
1 md Onion
Few sprigs dill & parsley
1 oz Pine nuts (pignoli)
1 ts Sugar (more to taste)
1 pn Thyme
Salt and pepper
1 oz Currants
This stuffing is for eggplants, pepper, tomatoes and zucchini. It is
made with olive oil and served as a cold vegetable dish.

Slice onion very finely, skin and roughly chop tomato and wash the
rice until the water runs clear. Heat the olive oil in a deep pot and
fry the onion until it becomes soft. Add the tomato, pine nuts,
currants, sugar, thyme and season and then stir in the drained rice
and fry them together for two or three minutes. Cover with just
enough water to come half an inch above the the level of the rice and
then boil out the water and steam for a few minutes until the rice
mixture is dry. Allow to cool. Stuff veggies with mixture, arrange in
a flat roasting pan, cover each one with its lid (after insides are
scooped out and sprinkled w/ salt). Pour around them enough water to
come half-way up their sides. Bake in a 350 oven for 45 min. or until
they are well cooked through & soft, but have not lost their shape.
Sprinkle w/ chopped dill and parsley. Enough stuffing for 2 pounds of
peppers.
