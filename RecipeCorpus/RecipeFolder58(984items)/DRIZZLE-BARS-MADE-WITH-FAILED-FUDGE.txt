Title: DRIZZLE BARS MADE WITH FAILED FUDGE
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 2 1/2 dozen
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 c  Butter
1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
1 c  All-purpose flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 1/2 oz Shredded sweetened coconut*
1    Recipe failed fudge (too
-hard, too soft, etc)
1 c  Candy chips*
1 c  Walnuts; chopped
14 oz Sweetened condensed milk
* can double these amounts. For chips, choose a flavor complementary
to fudge flavor. For instance, with chocolate fudge, use butterscotch
or peanut butter chips. Use semisweet chocolate with almost anything
else.

Preheat oven to 375'F. Melt butter and blend with sugar and flour
until cohesive. Then press into ungreased pan (8x8 or 9x9). Bake for
20 to 30 minutes. While crust is still hot, spread coconut over it.
Top with chips. Pour too-think fudge haphazardly over chips; dice
too-hard or grainy or chewy fudge and scatter over chips. Scatter
walnuts over that. Drizzle sweetened condensed milk over everything.
Bake for 20 minutes, then use a spatula to press down and compact
bars. Finish baking for 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on a rack and cut.

Yield: 2 1/2 dozen 2x2-inch bars.
