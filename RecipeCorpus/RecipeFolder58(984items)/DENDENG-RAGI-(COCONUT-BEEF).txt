vegetable side-dish. sambal and rice.

Slice half a kilo of rump steak into thin slices.  In a food
processor, process together 1 tablespoon of ground coriander, several
fresh basil leaves, 1 tablespoon of palm sugar (or substitute brown
sugar), 1/2 teaspoon of instant tamarind paste, 3 cloves of garlic
and 3 medium onions.

Heat a little oil in a frying pan or wok and gently fry the resulting
paste for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time. Turn up the heat,
add the beef to the pan, season and fry over high heat to taste. Set
aside.

Heat another pan or wok, without oil, and add to it 500 g of freshly
grated coconut (or 100 g moistened desiccated coconut) and 2 daun
salam leaves (or substitute bay leaves).  Turn the heat down
immediately and cook gently, stirring, until the coconut is golden

meat mixture and stir until the meat is reheated.  Remove bay leaves
and serve.
