Title: DORO WE'T (CHICKEN STEW)
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Chicken
9 oz Tomato paste
3    Sticks butter
10    Hard boiled eggs -- slightly
Scored
3 lb Onion -- fine Chopped
2    Cloves garlic -- minced
4 tb Berbere or awaze
1 ts Black pepper
Remove skin from the chicken and score each piece slightly with a
knife so the sauce can penetrate.

In a large stew pot, melt the butter, then saute the onions and
garlic for five minutes.  Add berbere, followed by tomato paste,
stirring occasionally while the mixture simmers about 15 minutes. A
piece at a time, stir in the chicken, coating well with the sauce.

Continue to simmer, adding enough water to maintain the consistency
of a thick soup.  When chicken is half done, after about 20 minutes,
put in the hard boiled eggs. Cover and continue cooking until the
chicken is tender.

The dish is ready when the oil has risen to the top. Add black pepper
and let sit until slightly cooled.
