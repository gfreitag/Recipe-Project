CHOCOLATE PIE CRUST: Sift the salt and flour into a bowl and cut in
the shortening, using a pastry blender, until coarse crumbs form. Add
the chocolate and water, tossing with a fork, until the dough forms.
Press the dough firmly into a ball and then roll out on a lightly
floured surface into a 13-inch circle. Loosely fit the dough into a
9-inch pie plate and trim the edge so that there it reaches 1 inch
beyond the rim of the pie plate.  Fold the extra under the edge of
the crust to from a ridge. Flute the edge and prick the entire
surface of the pie shell with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12
minutes or until a golden brown. Cool on a rack. CHOCOLATE PIE: Stir
the 1/4 cup of sugar, the gelatin and salt together in a 2-quart
saucepan.  Stir in the milk and slightly beaten egg yolks. Add 3 (1
oz) squares of unsweetened chocolate and cook over low heat, stirring
constantly, until the chocolate melts and the gelatin dissolves.
Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Chill in the
refrigerator, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is the
consistency of unbeaten egg whites. Remove the chocolate mixture from
the refrigerator and set aside Immediately beat the egg whites and
cream of tartar, in another bowl, until foamy, using an electric
mixer set on high speed. Gradually add the 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 Tbls
at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until
stiff, glossy peaks form when the beaters are slowly lifted. When the
chocolate mixture mounds slightly when dropped from a spoon, beat
until smooth, using an electric mixer at medium speed. Fold the egg
white mixture into the chocolate mixture; then fold in the whipped
cream. Chill in the refrigerator until the mixture mounds well when
spooned. Turn into the chocolate pie shell.  Chill in the
refrigerator for 2 hours or until set.  To serve, decorate the pie
with puffs of sweetened whipped cream. Grate and sprinkle the
chocolate over the whipped cream.
