Title: DELENA'S RICE CRISPIES FRIED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
3 ea Chicken fryer
3/4 c  Margarine
3 3/4 qt Rice crispies cereal
It's real simple; crush up the rice crispies in a bag. Dig Chicken in
butter, and then roll in rice crispies. Bake at 350 for about 45
minutes or until done. That's it. It sounds disgusting, but it tastes
great! Source: Delena Gaittino
