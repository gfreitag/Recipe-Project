For the cake, sift flour, baking powder and salt together. Grease and
lightly flour three 9-in cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, cream
butter with sugar, using an electric mixer, if possible. Add eggs,
one at a time, mixing well after each addition. The mixture should be
smooth and creamy. Using a spoon, add 1/3 of the flour & fold into
the batter with 1/3 of the milk. Repeat until flour & milk are
incorporated into batter. I is important that the ingredients be
folded in; the batter should not be beaten after flour has been
intorduced. Stir in vanilla. Distribute batter evenly among 3 cake
pans & bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 30 min. or until
layers are golden brown & spring back when gently pressed in the
middle. Cool for about 5 minutes & turn layers out of pans. For the
filling, combine sugar, flour & salt in a heavy saucepan. Add 2 c.
water & mix well. Cook over low-medium heat, stirring occasionallym
until thick. Add egg yolks, lemon juice, lemon zest & butter & cook
for 12 min, stirring occasionally. Cool For the topping: mix sugar,
cornstarch and salt in a heavy saucepan. Add 3/4 c. water gradually.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil 1 min. Remove from heat
and stir in butter & lemon rind. Greadually stir in lemon juice. Cool
To assemble:cover 1st & 2nd layers w/lemon filling. Spread
generously. Coat top of 3rd layer & sides of cake with clear lemon
topping. Filling & topping must be thoroughtly cooled before using.
Cake is better when made 24 hrs. before serving. Filling will be a
rich, yellow, lemon curd-type mixture and the topping a clear, tart
jelly. Source: Jan Adams Finn, The Washington Post, date unknown.
