heat. Add 2 celery stalks, 1 carrot and 1 chopped onion and cook
until vegetables begin to soften, stirring frequently, about 8
minutes. Mix in all remaining ingredients except sherry and rum. Add
stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.

3.  Discard bay leaf.  Mix in sherry and rum  (or use sherry pepper
sauce). Add fish, and serve immediately. (Note: The Bermudians add
sherry peppers at the table.)
