Title: BEAN BURGERS BY ANITA CECENA.
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Minced green onions.
1 1/2 tb Minced garlic.
2 tb White wine/stock
29 oz Cooked drained pinto beans
3/4 c  Cracker meal or bread crumbs
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Seasoned rice vinegar
1/2 ts Italian seasonings (oregano,
-basil, etc.)
Preheat oven 350 degrees. Saute onions/garlic in stock/white wine.
Combine with beans, cracker meal, egg whites, parsley, vinegar,
seasonings. Mash well with fork until blended, but not entirely
smooth. (Here I depart from recipe...I make up a bunch of hamburger
sized patties, freeze some, refridge some, and cook them as needed
for about 20 minutes in a toaster oven...I know they are done when
the egg/bread crumbs are brown and the patty is a bit dry.  I find
this basic recipe can absorb many, many changes.I've used white
beans, black beans, whatever, sauteed mushrooms, hot sauce, catsup,
etc. The main thing is to get a good texture/cohesiveness in the
final product, so it sticks together. Have fun!)
