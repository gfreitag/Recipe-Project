Recipe by: Joel.Ehrlich@salata.com (Joel Ehrlich) TO PREPARE COCONUT
MILK: Remove the shell and the brown inner skin from the meat of a
fully ripe coconut. Chop the meat (NOTE: you may substitute 1 cup of
packaged shredded coconut for the chopped coconut meat). Combine the
chopped coconut meat with one cup of scalded whole milk. Let stand
for 20 minutes. Remove bones and fat from the lamb. Cut the meat into
1" cubes. Melt half the butter in a large, heavy pan. Add the onion.
Cook until tender (about 5 minutes). Use a slotted spoon to remove
the onion. Set aside. Add the remaining butter to the pan. Brown the
lamb cubes on all sides. Return the onion to the pan. Add the ginger,
sugar, pepper, salt, curry powder, mint and milk. Mix well. Cover.
Simmer over low heat for 1 hour. Add the coconut milk and grated
coconut. Cover. Cook for 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the lime juice.
Slowly blend in the cream. Cook over low heat (DON'T LET IT BOIL !)
until the lamb is tender (10-15 minutes). Serve over hot, fluffy rice.
