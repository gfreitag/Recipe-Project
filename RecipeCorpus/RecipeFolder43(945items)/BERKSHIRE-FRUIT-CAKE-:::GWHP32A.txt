by General Foods Corp This is the last in a collection of 33 butter
cakes, and their frostings and fillings from an old pamphlet left by
my mother-in-law, Mrs. Mae Keller. Soon I will be working with the
balance of the pamphlet. I hope you have all enjoyed these recipes as
much as I have enjoyed sharing them with you. Note: I have posted 51
recipes in the Kate Smith Collection. If anyone is collecting these
recipes, and does not have 51, you can advise me which ones you do
have, and I will be happy to post any that you are missing.
