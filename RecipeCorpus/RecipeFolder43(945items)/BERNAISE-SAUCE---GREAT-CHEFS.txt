Title: BERNAISE SAUCE - GREAT CHEFS
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 2 Cups
1/2 lb Butter
4 lg Egg yolks, at room
-- temperature
1 1/2 tb Sauce, Worcestershire
2 tb Wine, red
1 pn Pepper, cayenne
2 tb Wine, Chablis
Salt (to taste)
1 tb Wine, white
2 ts Tarragon, dried, finely
-- crumbled
Melt the butter in a skillet over a medium flame. Do NOT burn the
butter.  When the butter is completely melted, remove the skillet
from the burner.

Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, red wine
and cayenne pepper in the top of a double boiler. The water in the
bottom pan should not touch the top pan and should be simmering, not
rapidly boiling.

Using a wire whisk, beat the egg-yolk mixture until it thickens
and a sheen forms, approximately 3 minutes, but no more than 5
minutes.

In a slow, steady stream, begin adding the melted butter with a
ladle, whipping it with a wire whisk. Continue until all of the
butter has been added.

Add the Chablis and whip well.  The sauce should be light and
fluffy.

In a small saucepan heat 1 tablespoon white wine and the tarragon
leaves until the liquid evaporates. Remove from the heat and add to
the sauce, mixing well.

Hold the sauce at room temperature until serving time.
