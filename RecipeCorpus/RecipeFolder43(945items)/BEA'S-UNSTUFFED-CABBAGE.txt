Categories: Ground beef, Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Onion diced (1 cup)
2 lb Head green cabbage,dice
8 oz Tomato sauce
28 oz Can peeled tomatoes & juice
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Honey

NOTE:  This has a long cooking time.  It is a dish that is best
prepared early in the day and reheated at serving time since the
flavor improves. NOTE:  Ms. Brody says that this dish could easily
feed a crowd if you have a pot or pots big enough to double or
guadruple, etc. it.

1.  In a large heavy pot combine all the soup ingredients except the
raisins.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat while preparing the
meatballs.

2.  Combine meatball ingredients, stirring them to mix thoroughly.
With wet hands, roll the meat mixture in 1 1/4" balls. Add the
meatballs to the boiling cabbage soup, reduce the heat to medium-low,
cover and simmer for 2 hours.

3.  Remove the cover, add the raisins, and cook for another 30
minutes in the uncovered pot.

She suggests that mashed potatoes would be an excellent accompaniment.
Also, that the dish goes well with broad egg noodles.
