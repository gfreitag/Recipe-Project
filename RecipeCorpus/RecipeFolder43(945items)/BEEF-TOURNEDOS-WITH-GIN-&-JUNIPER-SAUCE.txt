Categories: Main dish, Meats, Low-cal
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 c  Defatted beef stock
2 tb Gin
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
2 ts Juniper berries, crushed
1 ts Vegetable oil
2    Beef tenderloin steaks,
- trimmed of fat (4 ounces

1/2 ts Coarsely ground black peppe
Salt to taste
In a measuring cup, combine beef stock, gin, vinegar and juniper
berries. Set aside. Brush or rub steaks with vegetable oil. Press
pepper onto the steaks and season with salt.  Heat a medium-sized
cast-iron or heavy skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Place
steaks in the heated pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or
until browned on the outside but still pink inside.  Transfer steaks
to a plate and keep warm. Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium
and add the reserved stock mixture to the pan. Cook, stirring to
scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan, until reduced
slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Place the steaks on individual plates and
spoon the sauce over. Serves 2. Calories: 242 per serving; Protein:
