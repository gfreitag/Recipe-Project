MMMMM-------------------------BASIC STEW------------------------------
1 1/2 lb Boneless beef chuck
1 c  Stock
3/4 c  Onions, chopped
1/2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed
MMMMM-----------------------THIS VARIATION----------------------------
3 c  Beef stock
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Oyster sauce; or black bean
16 oz Mixed vegetables; NOT thawed
8 oz Capellini; thin spaghetti
sl Green onions; for garnish
You may substitute lamb or pork shoulder for the beef. Use beef stock
for beef, chicken stock for pork or lamb.

Basic stew: Trim meat of fat and cut into 1-1/2" chunks. Bring all
ingredients to boil in 4-qt pot, cover tightly, reduce heat, and
simmer 2-1/2 hours, until meat is tender. Crockpot directions: pile
all ingredients into crockpot and cook all day on LOW. When done:
skim off and discard fat.

It takes less than 8 minutes to assemble this stew. Then you can pay
it little or no attention as it simmers for about 2-1/2 hours. Make
multiples of the basic stew, then divide stew into 4-serving
portions; refrigerate or in airtight containers for up to 5 days, or
freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in microwave-safe container on
defrost or in refrigerator for 24 hours.

To assemble: heat basic stew, stock, water, and oyster sauce in 4-qt
pot over medium heat until boiling gently. Stir in vegetables. Coo9k
5 minutes, until thawed and hot. Add pasta and, stirring almost
constantly, cook 3 minutes, until pasta is firm but tender and stock
is thickened.

Lamb and pork would be good here, too.  Oyster sauce and black bean
sauce are available in the Asian-food section of your market. Keep in
mind that noodles will continue to absorb liquid, so this stew should
be served immediately.  If you're not sure how soon it will be eaten,
cook noodles separately, thicken stock with 2 tb cornstarch stirred
into 1/2 c cold water, and then add cooked noodles just before
serving.
