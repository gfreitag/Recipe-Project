This salad is very easy to make, and combines the sour, sweet and
salty flavors typical of Thai cuisine. From "Thai Cooking From the
Siam Cuisine Restaurant" (North Atlantic Books, 1989).

Pound dried shrimp in a mortar to flatten them into soft, crumbly
pieces. (They should still be in relatively whole pieces.) Set aside.

Soak the mung bean thread noodle in water for 1 hour, until soft.
Using a strainer to hold the noodles, dip them into boiling for 1
second. Remove and immediately dip into ice water to stop the
cooking. Drain well and set aside.

Using a strainer to hold the prawns, boil for 6 seconds until they
turn pink. Drain well.

Combine prawns and lime juice in a medium bowl; let stand 1 minute.
Add the dried shrimp, noodles, fish sauce, sugar, mush- rooms rooms,
celery, green onions and coriander leaves.

Arrange the salad on a bed of lettuce and serve immediately. PER
