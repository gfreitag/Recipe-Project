++++++++++++++ +++++ Remove membrane from flank steak. If it is a
thick slab of meat, slice with grain into thin sheet about 1/4"
thick. Slice across grain into matchsticks about 2 1/2" long. Halve
and core bell pepper; scald pepper halves until color turns bright
green; plunge in cold water to stop cooking process. Slice pepper
thinly to match cooked meat. Peel and quarter garlic clove; add to
peanut oil. Mix sauce ingredients. Stir-frying:  Heat wok as hot as
possible. Add garlic and 1/2 the oil; stir; remove garlic when it
browns. Add salt to oil; stir. Add half of flank steak; toss and stir
briskly to coat with oil and prevent scorching of   meat.  When meat
begins to shrivel, remove to platter. Rinse wok; reheat; add rest of
oil.  Stir-fry remaining meat. Add peppers, sauce, other beef; toss
briskly for about 1 minute until sauce evaporates. Serve. Garnishing
note: Time and inclination permitting, deep-fry about 12 shrimp
chips.  Arrange on serving platter around beef and peppers.
