Title: BEER-BATTER ONION RINGS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 tb Oil
2    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Beer
2 lg White onions
-sliced 1/4-in thick
Oil for deep frying
MIX THE FLOUR, SALT, PEPPER, oil and yolks together. Gradually whisk
in the beer. Refrigerate the batter 3 1/2 hours to rest before using.
Slice onions, and dip them in the batter. Deep-fry in 375F oil until
golden brown. This batter also works well on other vegetables besides
onion rings--and it's great on fish, too.
