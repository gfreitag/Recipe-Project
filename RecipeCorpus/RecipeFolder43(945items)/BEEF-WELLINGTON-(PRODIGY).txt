STUFFING: Puree the mushrooms and onions together in a food
processor. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, add the
mushroom and onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
mixture is dry. Add salt and pepper to taste and mash in the pate.
Transfer the stuffing to a bowl and chill in the refrigerator.

MEAT: Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the beef and sear
on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Place in the refrigerator until cold.

ASSEMBLE THE WELLINGTON: Roll out chilled puff pastry into a rectangle
large enough to enclose the beef. Spread the dough with a generous
layer of stuffing, place the beef on top and spoon another bit of
stuffing on the beef. Wrap the pastry to enclose the beef and
stuffing and place the Wellington in the refrigerator to chill for at
least 15 minutes.

COOK THE WELLINGTON: Preheat oven to 425F. Place Wellington in oven
and immediately lower heat to 350F. Roast for about 20 minutes.
