Title: BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH RED WINE SAUCE
Categories: None
Yield: 12 Servings
3 lb Beef tenderloin
2 c  Cabernet Sauvignon or other
Dry red wine
2 ts Dried marjoram
1 ts Salt
8    Black peppercorns, crushed
6    Whole cloves
4    Garlic cloves, halved
13 3/4 oz Can no-salt-added beef broth
Vegetable cooking spray
2 tb Cornstarch
INSTRUCTIONS: Cabernet Sauvignon gives depth and peppercorns give
bite to this robust dish. You might want to use a bigger-bodied
Cabernet or Zinfandel, which will reduce to a fine sauce.

Trim fat from tenderloin; fold under 3 inches of small end. Tie
tenderloin with string at 2-inch intervals. Combine wine and next 6
ingredients in large zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag. Add tenderloin
to bag, and seal. Marinate in refrigerator 2 hours, turning
occasionally.

Remove tenderloin from bag, reserving marinade. Strain marinade;
discard solids, and set marinade aside. Coat a large Dutch oven with
cooking spray; place over medium-high heat until hot. Add tenderloin,
and cook 2 minutes on all sides or until browned.

Place tenderloin on rack coated with cooking spray; place rack in
roasting pan. Insert thermometer into thickest portion of tenderloin.
Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes or until thermometer registers 140
degrees (rare) to 160 degrees (medium).

Place tenderloin on a serving platter; cover with aluminum foil. Let
stand 10 minutes. Remove string before slicing.

Place cornstarch in a bowl. Gradually add the 1/4 cup reserved
marinade, blending with a wire whisk; set aside. Place remaining
reserved marinade in Dutch oven. Bring to a boil, and cook 2 minutes.
Add cornstarch mixture to pan; bring to a boil, and cook 1 minute or
until slightly thickened, stirring constantly. Serve the sauce with
tenderloin. Yield: 12 servings (serving size: 3 ounces tenderloin and
1/4 cup sauce).
