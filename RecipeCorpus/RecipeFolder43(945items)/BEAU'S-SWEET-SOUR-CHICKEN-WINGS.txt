Title: BEAU'S SWEET-SOUR CHICKEN WINGS
Categories: Appetizers, Family
Yield: 1 Batch
20    Chicken wings
7 1/2 oz Tomato sauce (half can)
2 tb Orange marmalade
1 tb Honey
2 ts Ginger, minced
2 ts Fermented chili sauce
-(Summit brand)
2 ts Pepper vinegar
4    Garlic cloves, peeled
1 ts Salt (scant)
2 ts MSG
1/2 c  Water (more as needed)
ds Tabasco, to taste
-(or other hot pepper
-sauc )

Cut off spurs from chicken wing-tips and rinse chicken wings. Place in
pressure cooker with water; bring to pressure and cook at high heat
for up to five minutes. Remove from pressure cooker and place
cooked-out fat in wide-mouthed, tapered jar for other uses.

Blend all ingredients except chicken and Tabasco (or hot sauce) until
fairly even consistency, with no large chunks of ginger or garlic.

Place 3/4 of sauce in pan.  Roll wings in sauce; remove wings to
broiler pan (with slotted top).  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 20
minutes. Remove from oven and spoon about half of remaining sauce on
top of each piece; broil for 5 minutes.  Add Tabasco or other hot
pepper sauces to taste and serve.

Beau's notes:

*  Use vinegar "which has been used to keep a supply of bird's-eye
peppers."

*  After discarding chicken spurs, wash hands with very warm water
and Dial soap (and follow up with isopropyl alcohol rinse); wash all
utensils with bleach.  (One should always regard chickens, even if
processed in USA or inspected by USDA, as unclean! USDA inspectors
are notoriously less than thorough, and U.S. packing houses often
neglect basic hygienic rules in working with chickens, especially in
dealing with their entrails, waste products un-excreted, etc. And one
should not expect much better from out-of-country chickens.)
