Comment in book:  This is the hot and exotic spice mixture that give
Eritrean and Ethiopian cooking its characteristic flavor. The
traditional method of preparation is lengthy and uses some spices and
herbs not readily available here.  The mixture presented is a close
adaptation, and it keeps well for months refrigerated. Berbere is
called for in the W'et recipes and can be used in other recipes that
call for a hot spice.
