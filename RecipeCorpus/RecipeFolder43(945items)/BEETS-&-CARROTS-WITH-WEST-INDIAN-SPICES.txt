Title: BEETS & CARROTS WITH WEST INDIAN SPICES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Beets (about 4 medium)
1 lb Carrots, sliced
2 tb Grated fresh gingerroot
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
x  Grated zest of 1 orange
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Mace
Wash the beets well and cut off the leaves, leaving an inch or so of
stem. Cover with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer, covered
until tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and cover with cool or lukewarm
water. When cool enough to handle, slip off the skins. Cut the beets
into slices or chunks.

Peel and cut the carrots into slices or chunks, resemling the beets
in size and

style.  Steam or boil in lightly salted water about 5 minutes or until
tender but not soft. Drain.

Combine the ginger, sugar, orange juice, vinegar, orange zest and
spices in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook until
thickened. Simmer the cooked beets and carrots in this sauce for
about 5 minutes.

Note:  Alternatively, you may bake the beets in a foil-covered pan for
about an

hour.  When cool, slip off the skins.  Cut the beets into slices or
chunks.

Since I didn't want to waste the beet tops, I sliced the green beet
tops and steamed them and when I combined the sauce with the cooked
beets and carrots, I

also added the steamed beet tops.

This came from the Eat More, Weigh Less book by Dr. Dean Ornish.
