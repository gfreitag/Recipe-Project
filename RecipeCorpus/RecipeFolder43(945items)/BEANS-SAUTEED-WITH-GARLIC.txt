Title: BEANS SAUTEED WITH GARLIC
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb String Beans
1 lg Fat Clove of Garlic
2 tb Sunflower oil
1 c  Water
Salt and Pepper
Take a handful of beans, lay them flat and cut of the ends. Do the
same with the other end, then the rest of the beans. Wash them. Heat
the oil in a large frying pan, preferably one in which you can lay
all the beans in one layer, and put in the beans and finely chopped
garlic. Turn for two or three minutes until well coated in garlic and
oil. Pour in just enough water to cover and turn the heat up to
maximum. The water will boil away as the beans cook - it will take no
more than seven or eight minutes. Once the beans started to sizzle as
the water boils away, sprinkle them generously with salt and black
pepper. When the water has completely evaporated the beans are ready.
