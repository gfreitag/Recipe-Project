Title: BEANS COOKED IN A POT (FRIJOLES DE OLLA)
Categories: Mexican, Beans
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Beans - black, turtle, pink,
-or pinto
An earthenware bean pot (I
-used my crock pot)
10 c  Hot water
1/4 c  White onion, roughly sliced
2 tb Lard
1 tb Salt, or to taste
2 lg Sprigs epazote (only if
-black beans are used) (An
-herb)
*Pinto or pink beans will need 12 to 14 cups water

Rinse the beans and run them through your hands to make sure that
there are no small stones or bits of earth among them.

Put the beans into the pot and cover them with the hot water. Add the
onion and lard and bring to a boil.

As soon as the beans come to a boil, lower the flame and let them
barely simmer, covered, for about 3 hours for black beans and 2-1/2
hours for the other varieties, or until they are tender, but not
soft. Do not stir during this time.

Add the salt and epazote, if you are using it, and simmer for another
30 minutes.  Set aside, preferably until the next day. There should
be plenty of soupy liquid.
