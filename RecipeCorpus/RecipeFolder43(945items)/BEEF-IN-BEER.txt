Title: BEEF IN BEER
Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Vegetable oil
3 lb Boneless chuck cut into
Chunks for stew
6 c  Sliced onions (1 1/2 lb)
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
4    Garlic cloves, minced
1 c  Beef stock or bouillon
2 tb Brown sugar
2 c  To 3 cup dark beer
(microbrew preferred)
1 lg Herb bouquet *
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch - blended with
2 tb Red wine vinegar
Herb bouquet is 6 parsley springs, one bay leave and 1/2 teaspoon
dried thyme tied in a cheesecloth.

Preheat oven to 325.  Add oil to heavy skillet and heat until almost
smoking.  Brown meat quickly in batches, do not crown the pan. Set
meat aside.

Reduce heat to medium, add onions (add more oil if necessary)and brown
onions lightly for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from pan
and set aside. Season with salt and pepper and then stir in garlic.

Arrange half of the browned meat in dutch oven and season lightly
with salt and pepper.  Spread half of the onions over the beef.
Repeat with the rest of the beef and onions.

Heat the stock in the skillet scrapping up any browned bits stuck to
the bottom.  Stir in the brown sugar and pour over the beef/onion
mixture. Add enough beer so the meat is barely covered. Bury the herb
bouquet in the center of the meat chunks.  Bring the mixture to a
simmer on top of the stove, cover and place in lower third of the
preheated 325 degree oven. Cook at slow simmer for 2 1/2 hours.

Remove herb bouquet. Drain liquid into a saucepan and skim off fat.
Blend cornstarch mixture into the cooking liquid and simmer for 3 to
4 minutes. Taste and correct seasoning. There should be about 2 cups
of sauce. Pour sauce back over the meat.

When ready to serve, cover the casserole and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes
until meat is heated through.

Serve with new potatoes or noodles garnished with parsley.
