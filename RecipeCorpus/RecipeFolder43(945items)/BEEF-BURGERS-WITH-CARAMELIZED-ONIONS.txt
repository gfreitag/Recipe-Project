Categories: Grbeef
Yield: 4 Servings
1/3 c  Bulgur
2 ts Olive oil
4 c  Onion(s), sliced (4 med)
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Balsamic vinegar
Salt to taste
3/4 lb Lean ground beef
2 tb Tomato paste
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
1/4 ts Black pepper
4    Hamburger buns
Split and toasted
Lettuce
In a small bowl, combine the bulgur with  1/2 cup warm water; let
stand for 30 min, or until the bulgur is tender and the water is
absorbed.

In a large non-stick skillet, heat oil over low heat. Add onions and
sugar; saute until the onions are tender and dark golden, about 15
min. Stir in 1/4 cup water and vinegar. Season with salt and keep
warm.

Prepare the grill or preheat the broiler. In a medium bowl, combine
the bulgur, beef, tomato paste, parsley, 1/2 tsp salt and pepper; mix
thoroughly but lightly. Shape into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Grill
over high heat or broil on a lightly oiled rack until browned and
cooked through, about 5 min per side. Blot the patties with paper
towels. Place each patty on a bun, top with the caramelized onions
and garnish with lettuce.
