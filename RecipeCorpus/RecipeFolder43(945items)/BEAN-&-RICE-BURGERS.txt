Title: BEAN & RICE BURGERS
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Cooked brown rice
1 1/2 c  Cooked beans -- pink,
-kidney, navy,
1/2 c  Wheat flour (or white)
1 tb Margarine or butter

1    Clove garlic -- mashed

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
1 c  Cooked mashed potatoes
1/2 c  Cornmeal
1/2 c  Bran
1/2 c  Cracked wheat
1 sm Pepper -- diced
1    Grated carrot
Heat greased (I use cooking spray) grill or electric frypan on med
heat. ***Or, you can grease a 13"x9" glass baking pan and bake at
350* for 30 Min. Just spread mix in pan and cook uncovered. Use a
pancake turner to cut and remove cooked 'burger'.*** Mash beans. Add
all ingredients and mix well. (If you use all of the ingredients
listed your mix may be a bit dry. You might want to add a 1/4 to 1/2
cup of soy, nut, or rice milk. Of coarse you also could use whole
milk. Be sure you don't thin it too much or it will be mushy. Look
for a 'hamburger' consistency.) Spoon about 2 heaping Tablespoons of
mix onto grill or frypan for each burger and flatten with greased
pancake turner. Turn several times rather than just once on each side
like conventional burgers, they have a better texture that way.
