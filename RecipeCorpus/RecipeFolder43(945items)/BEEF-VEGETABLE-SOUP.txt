Wash soup bones.  Put on aluminum lined tray and brown in a 400F oven
until well browned on both sides.  Put bones in soup pot, drain
grease and then get as much of the browned bits as possible using a
little water to help them along.  Add water until the bones are well
covered. Turn on heat. Add carrots, onions, celery, tomatoes
(whatever goes with the soup) some salt and pepper and let simmer
most of the day. Remove bones and chop what meat there is.  Throw out
the vegetables and skim off as much fat as possible (if left in
refrigerator overnight it will come to the top and get hard and can
be removed easily).  Put chopped meat back, add 3 quarts whole
tomatoes (mashed), a couple of cubed potatoes, and about a half
package of frozen mixed vegetables.  Let simmer until potatoes are
done and until needed. The soup is better the next day. Cooked
noodles can be added.
