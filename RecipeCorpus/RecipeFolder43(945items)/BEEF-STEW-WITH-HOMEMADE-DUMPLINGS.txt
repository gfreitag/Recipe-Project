Dutch oven, saute beef in oil over med-high heat to brown. Add bay
leaf, broth and wine. Bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low;
cover and simmer 1 hour. Stir occasionally. Cut carrots, onion,
potatoes, and celery into 1-inch chunks. Add vegetables to stew.

longer. To serve, sprinkle with chopped parsley if desired.
