Place the gizzards in a large saucepan with water to cover; salt and
pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, and simmer 20 minutes or until the
gizzards are done. Drain the gizzards, reserving the broth, and chop
them into bite-sized pieces. Skim the broth.

Make a light roux of the flour and butter, then add the garlic. Bring
the reserved broth back to a boil, then pour about a cup of the
boiling broth into the roux, stirring constantly. When the mixture
thickens, gradually pour in enough of the broth to make a cream-soup
consistency, stirring constantly. Return the gizzard pieces to the
stew, and heat a few minutes. Serve with challah.
