Title: BEEF TIPS IN RED WINE SAUCE
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Jaw
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Cubed beef sirloin, trimmed
Of all visable fat
2 ts Olive oil
1 md Yellow onion, chopped
2 c  Sliced mushrooms
1    Clove garlic, crushed
1 tb Flour
1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1 1/2 c  Beef broth
3 c  Cooked extra-wide egg
Noodles
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
Brown beef cubes in the olive oil in a 12 inch nonstick skillet set
over medium heat. Turn the cubes frequently to ensure even browning
on all sides. Add the onions and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until
the onions are fragrant. Add the mushrooms and garlic and reduce heat
to medium low; cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes
longer, or until mushrooms are brown.

Combine the flour, thyme leaves, black pepper and nutmeg in a small
dish. Sprinkle the flour mixture evenly over the meat and mushroom
mixture, stirring well. Allow the flour mixture to "toast" in the pan
without burning for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then, stir in the red
wine and beef broth. Stir until the liquid comes to a boil and
thickens very slightly. Reduce heat to low, cover loosely, and simmer
for 20 minutes. The sauce will continue to thicken as water
evaporates during cooking. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a few
tablespoons of water or beef broth.

While the meat is cooking, cook the noodles according to package
directions. When tender, stir the noodles and parsley into the beef
mixture and heat through.
