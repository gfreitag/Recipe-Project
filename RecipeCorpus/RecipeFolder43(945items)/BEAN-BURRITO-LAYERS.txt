Servings:  4

Rinse lentils and beans, discarding any that look suspicious, and
soak in clean water 4 - 6 hours, or overnight. Put into medium
saucepan, bring to boil and simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Add water if
necessary.

Peel and chop onion.  Microwave on "High" 2 - 2 1/2 minutes until
soft. [If you prefer, you may saute the onion in about 2 T. oil. I
omit the oil to keep the fat content down. The flavour does not seem
to suffer.] Chop the Jalapena pepper.  (*) Adjust the quantity to
your own taste and / or tolerance.

Peel and crush the garlic.

Drain the lentil-bean mixture.  Reserve 1/2 cup of liquor. In a food
processor puree the lentil-bean mixture, the onion, the garlic, the
jalapena peppers, the oregano, the chile powder, and the coriander
leaves, adding some of the reserved liquor as necessary to process.
[The final puree should be quite thick.]

Pre-heat the oven to 325 F.

Assemble as follows on an oven-proof plate, pizza-pan or cookie-sheet:

Place a flour tortilla on the *lightly* greased surface. Cover with
lentil-bean puree [4 - 5 T.]. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Add
another flour tortilla and repeat, saving enough cheese to cover the
top of the final flour tortilla.  Bake for 20 - 30 minutes.

Remove from oven and allow to "firm-up" for 5 - 10 minutes before
serving.

Garnish with salsa, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce. Serve with
rice, Couscous and / or corn.

The amount of oregano, coriander leaves, chile powder, or jalapena
peppers may be varied to suit individual tastes. I use more peppers!
If you're prone to "problems" with beans, add 1/4 - 1/2 t. Hing [Hing
is a mixture of rice-flour, turmeric and asafoetida
<ass-uh-fuh-TEE-duh> found in most East-Indian specialty stores. It
can significantly reduce flatulence.
