Title: BENNAGIN'S GARLIC MASHED POTATOES
Categories: Copycat, Side dishes, Potatos
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Red potatoes
3 tb Butter
1/4 c  Half and half
4    Cloves Roasted Garlic
To get the REAL flavor, these potatoes need to be baked, not boiled.
Bake them in a 350~ oven for 20-30 mins. This would be a great time
to roast the garlic too. You can either use a traditional roaster, or
just wrap the bulb in foil and roast that, be sure to coat the bulb
with olive oil. Remove the potatoes from oven and allow them to cool.
You can leave the peels on or off. I leave a few of them on. Chop
potatoes, add butter, and half and half, and mix with an electric
mixture. Add cloves of garlic, and add salt and pepper to taste. You
will want to reheat the potatoes before serving. Formatted by
