For Sesame-Chili Sauce, in a small saucepan combine all of the
ingredients except chicken. Cook over medium heat till bubbly,
stirring frequently. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Set
aside.

Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels. If desired, remove skin from
chicken and discard.  If using quartered chickens, break wing, hip,
and drumstick joints so the bird will lie flat during cooking. Twist
wing tips undr backs.

Place chicken, skin side down, on an uncovered grill directly over
MEDIUM coals.  Grill for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 15 to 25 minutes
more or till tender and no longer pink. Brush with sauce frequently
during the last 10 minutes of grilling.

Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Heat any remaining sauce
either on the grill or stove top; pass with chicken.

Make-ahead tip:  The Sesame-Chili Sauce can be made up to 5 days
ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.
