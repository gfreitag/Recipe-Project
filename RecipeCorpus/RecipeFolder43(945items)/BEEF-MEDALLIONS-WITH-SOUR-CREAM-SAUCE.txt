Title: BEEF MEDALLIONS WITH SOUR CREAM SAUCE
Categories: Beef, Sauces, From cook4u, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Filet of beef
3 tb Butter
1/4 lb Mushrooms, thin sliced
1 tb Shallots, minced
2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 tb Capers
1 c  Sour cream
1 tb Dill chopped fresh
1. Trim all fat from beef. Cut the fillets into 12 crosswise pieces of
equal size, about 1/2-in. thick. 2. Melt 2 tbsp of butter in a skillet
large enough to hold the pieces comfortably without crowding. Add the
pieces of filet and cook over moderately high heat about 35-40 sec.
The pieces should be nicely browned on one side. Turn the pieces and
cook about 30-45 sec. on the other side. 3. Immediately transfer the
pieces to a warm serving platter. Add the mushrooms to the skillet
and stir. Add the shallots and cook about 15 sec. Stir in the vinegar
and capers. 4. Add the sour cream and stir well. Let the sauce come
to a simmer. Add any juices that have accumulated around the steak on
the serving platter. Remove the skillet from the heat and swril in
the remaining butter. 5. Pour the sauce over and around the steak and
sprinkle the dill on top.
