This is Ben and Jerry's most popular base, has creamy texture, medium
body, and a subtle, understated taste. It's especially good as a
background for fruit,cookies and candy. Whisk the eggs in a mixing
bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a
little at a time, then continue to whisk until completely blended,
about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend.
Makes 1 quart.
