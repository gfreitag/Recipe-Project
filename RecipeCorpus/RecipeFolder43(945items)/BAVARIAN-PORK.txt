Categories: Pork, Ham

4    Boneless pork sirloin chops
2    To 3 garlic cloves -- minced
2 tb Cooking oil -- divided
1/2 c  Seasoned flour
1/2 lb Mushrooms -- sliced

1/2 ts Thyme
1 cn Beer -- room temperature
1 tb To 2T sour cream -- optional
In 1 tablespoon of oil, saute garlic; then lightly flour pork and
brown until golden. Remove pork and set aside. In same skillet, add
another tablespoon of oil; saute scallions and mushrooms. Return pork
to pan; sprinkle with thyme.  Add 8-12 oz beer, depending on
thickness of cut; bring to boil (the alcohol evaporates and leaves a
"malt" flavor, so thedarker the brand, the better). Cover and simmer
8 minutes for thin, 15-20 minutes for thick. Spoon sauce over meat to
serve. For a richer sauce, add 1-2 tablespoons sour creamjust before
serving. From Ann Conway
