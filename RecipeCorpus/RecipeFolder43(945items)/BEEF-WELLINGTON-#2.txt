Title: BEEF WELLINGTON #2
Categories: Beef, Meats, Kooknet
Yield: 8 Servings
1 ea 10-ounce package frozen
Patty shells
4 lb Beef tenderloin roast
Salt
All-purpose flour
2 c  Fresh mushrooms, chopped
2 tb Butter
4 oz Can goose liver pate
1 tb Cognac
2 ts Chives, snipped
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 ea Egg yolk
1 tb Water
Allow patty shells to thaw 2 hours in refrigerator before rolling
out. If meat is quite long (Lin, control Thyself!!), fold narrow end
under to form a roast about 12 to 13 inches in length. Place on rack
in shallow roasting pan.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and flour. Bake,
uncovered, in 425 F oven until meat thermometer inserted in thickest
portion registers 120 F, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Cool meat
sufficiently to handle, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in skillet, cook
mushrooms in butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add pate, Cognac and chives. Make a deep slit in center of roast,
cutting from side, to but not through opposite side. Sprinkle pocket
with salt and pepper. Spoon mushroom-pate mixture into pocket.  On
lightly floured surface, arrange patty shells in a rectangle,
overlapping edges slightly; press edges to seal. (If necessary,
moisten edges with a little water.) Roll out to a 16x11-inch
rectangle. Place roast in a greased 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Lay
pastry over roast, tucking under securely.  Brush pastry with mixture
of egg yolk and water. Bake in 425 F oven for 20 minutes more, or
until pastry is golden. Makes 8 servings.
