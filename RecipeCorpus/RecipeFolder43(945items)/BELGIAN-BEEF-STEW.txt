Title: BELGIAN BEEF STEW
Categories: Soups, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Lean stewing beef
- cut into 1 1/2-in cubes
Flour for dredging
5 tb Vegetable oil
2 lg Onions
- peeled and thinly sliced
2    Garlic cloves
- peeled and minced
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
12 oz Beer
2 lb Sauerkraut
- rinsed and squeezed dry
2 tb Marjoram
2 tb Dark brown sugar
1 ts Celery seed
1    Bay leaf
3/4 c  Pitted green olives, sliced
1 c  Cream (optional)
1/2 c  Minced flat-leaf parsley
- for garnish
PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Dredge the meat in flour. Heat 3 tablespoons of
oil in a Dutch oven. Add only enough meat to cover the bottom of the
pan without crowding and brown on all sides, scraping and turning the
cubes so that they don't burn. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon
to a bowl, and continue until all the meat is browned, adding fresh
oil as needed. If the oil has burned or more oil is needed, add the
remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot. When it is hot, add the
onions and cook for 6-to-7 minutes more, stirring frequently until
they are light brown and soft. Stir in the garlic. Add the meat,
salt, pepper, beer, sauerkraut, marjoram, brown sugar, celery seed,
bay leaf and olives and stir to mix well. Cover and transfer the
casserole to the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally. After the
meat is tender, remove the bay leaf, skim off any excess fat and stir
in the cream, if desired. Add the parsley.
