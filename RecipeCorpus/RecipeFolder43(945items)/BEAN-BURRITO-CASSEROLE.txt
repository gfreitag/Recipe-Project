Title: BEAN BURRITO CASSEROLE
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
12    Tortillas; * see note
3 c  Pinto beans, canned; rinsed
2 c  Brown rice, cooked
1 c  Green onions; chopped
Enchilada sauce:
2 c  Tomato sauce; ** see note
3 c  Water
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Onion powder
3 tb Chili powder
4 tb Cornstarch; *** see note
Preparation Time: 2:07 This may be made without the brown rice; use 5
cups mashed cooked and drained beans instead. The sauce can also be
used in other Mexican recipes.

To make the enchilada sauce combine all ingredients in a saucepan and
cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens,
about 7 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the
enchilada sauce in the bottom of a covered casserole dish. Take one
tortilla at a time and spread some beans, rice, and scallons down the
center. Roll up and place seam-side-down in the casserole dish.
Repeat until all ingredients are used. Pour the remaining enchilada
sauce over the rolled-up tortillas, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.
