Mix all the ingredients thoroughly, either in a food processor or
with a potato masher. The cooked beans should be mashed, not pureed,
and the mixture should form into balls easily. If the mixture is too
wet, add a little more breadcrumbs or flour. Form the mixture into
eight burgers and place them on a lightly greased baking tray. Bake
at 350'F. for 45 minutes, turning them over after 30 minutes. Place
the burgers inside buns ("Eating In" also includes a recipe for
whole-wheat buns) and top with fried onions, lettuce, tomato,
pickles, or whatever your taste dictates. Each burger contains: 352
