Title: BEEF OR GAME JERKY
Categories: Appetizers, Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Salt
2 c  Soy sauce
1 c  Water
1 c  Red wine
1/2 ts Onion powder
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Tabasco sauce
Trim all fat from meat.  Slice meat with the grain to about 1/4" to
1/2" thick.  The meat slices nicely when semi-frozen, or your butcher
will slice it for you in his machine. Place meat in the cool marinade
and leave overnight, or for no less than 8 hours.

Remove from brine and allow to air dry without rinsing. Smoke in your
smoker for 12 to 16 hours or until jerky has dried out to your
liking. Use your favorite fuel for smoking.
