4 lb Boston pork butt
1    Bottle BBQ Saucee
Cook Boston pork butt all day, or until it is so tender it falls apart
easily.  Romove from pot and let it cool slightly, but do not let it
get cold.  Pull meat away from fat (remove fat and discard) and shred
meat with two forks.  Return meat to crockpot and add a bottle of
your favorite barbeque sauce (I like KC Masterpiece, or Kraft Honey
Barbeque sauce) and stir until thoroughly combined. Continue cooking
until heated through. This makes great sandwiches on buns, or meat
entree. Great with coleslaw and baked beans.
