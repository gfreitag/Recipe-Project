Trim the leaves off the beets, but do not remove the tops or pierce
the beets themselves, or their juice will bleed into the water and
flavor and color will be lost. Fill a saucepan with enough water to
cover the beets generously and bring to a rapid boil. Add the beets
and reduce the heat so that the beets boil gently until tender, 20 to
30 minutes. When you can pierce them easily with a sharp knife, thin
skewer, or, better yet, a cake tester, they are done. (Try to use
something as thin as possible to prevent the beets from bleeding
excessively when they are pierced.) They should be tender but not
mushy.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine all the dressing ingredients,
including salt and pepper to taste. Whisk to blend. When the beets
are cooked, drain them into cold water to cool so they can be
handled. Drain again and cut off the tops and slip off the skins. Cut
into 1/4-inch thick slices and place in a salad bowl. Pour over the
dressing, toss well, and serve. The beets can also be left to
marinate at room temperature for several hours.

Ahead-of-time note: This entire dish can be prepared a day in advance,
covered, and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before serving.
