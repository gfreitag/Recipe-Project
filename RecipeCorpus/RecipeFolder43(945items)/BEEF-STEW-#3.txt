Coat meat lightly with flour and brown in oil (or you can stick the
coated meat on a broiler pan and brown it in the oven (saves time and
has the added option of not being fried in oil). Put meat in stew pan
(I used a large turkey roasting covered pan), add carrot chunks,
potatoe chunks and onion.  Add enough water to cover everything and
put in the oven @ 350 for 2.5 hours. After the stew has been in the
oven for approx. 1.5 hours add the packaged dry gravy (no need to mix
it with water -- there should be enough water in the stew pan). Mix
it in well and continue stewing! This is great served with dinner
rolls and a green salad.
