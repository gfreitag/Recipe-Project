Title: BEINETS OR FRENCH FRITTERS
Categories: Breads, Brunch, French
Yield: 5 Servings
-ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
6 tb -water
1 tb Butter
6 tb All-purpose flour
4    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
Confectioner's sugar
These are as light as air.  Heat deep fat to 370 degrees. Combine
water, butter and flour in a saucepan and boil (stirring constantly)
over low heat for about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and beat in
one at a time, the eggs.  Beat the batter for about 3 minutes AFTER
each egg. Add the vanilla and drop the batter from a teaspoon into
the hot fat. Cook until golden, drain and dust with the
confectioner's sugar To be good these must be delicate in flavor,
therefore the frying fat must be impeccable. If you fry in the usual
bland cooking oil, heat it to 365-70 degrees and cook the batter
until almost golden. If you use butter or part butter for frying,
start frying with the fat at 330 degrees and let the heat rise over a
7 minute period to 360. Be sure to bring the heat of the fat DOWN to
330 again between cookings.
