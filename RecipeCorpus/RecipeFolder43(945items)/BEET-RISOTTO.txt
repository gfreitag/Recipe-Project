keep broth at a low simmer. 2. Heat butter and oil in a heavy-bottom
4-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and cook for 1-2
minutes or until it begins to soften, being careful not to brown it.
3. Add rice and stir for 1 minute, making sure all the grains are
well-coated. Add wine and stir until wine is completely absorbed.
Add beets and 1/2 cup of the hot broth. When broth is almost
completely absorbed, add another 1/2 cup of hot broth. Stir for 30
seconds.  Continue to cook on medium to medium high heat, adding
broth in 1/2 cups, stirring for 30 seconds and cooking until almost
all the broth is absorbed. 4. After approximately 18 minutes, when
the rice is tender but still a little firm and all broth has been
added and absorbed, remove from heat and stir in cream, parmesan and
chopped parsley. Stir vigorously to combine.

Presentation: Spoon into 4 shallow bowls and garnish each bowl with a
sprig of fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley.  Serve immediately.
