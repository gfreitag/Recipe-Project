Title: BEIGNETS DE CARNAVAL OR FASTNACHTSKIECHLA
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
4 lg Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Butter, softened
1/2 c  Beer
Oil for deep frying Confectioners sugar mixed with ground cinnamon

Pour the flour and salt into a bowl and make a crater. Into the
crater put the eggs, sugar, butter and beer. Mix well with a wooden
spoon, then turn out of bowl onto a heavily floured surface. Knead
until mixture is a firm dough.  Let stand, covered, for 1 hour.

Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4
inch (1/2 cm).  Use a cutter or knife to cut the dough into any
shapes you wish: squares, rectangles, crescents, hearts etc.

Heat the oil to 375 F. (190 C).

Fry the fritters in hot oil for about 3 to 4 minutes turning to brown
on both sides.  Remove when they are the proper shade of golden brown.

Drain on absorbent paper and sprinkle with a mixture of confectioner's
sugar and cinnamon.

These may be served as dessert; but they are also delicious at
breakfast or for between-meals snacks.

Yields 24.
