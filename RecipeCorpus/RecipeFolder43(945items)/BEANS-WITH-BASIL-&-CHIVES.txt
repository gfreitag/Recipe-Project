Title: BEANS WITH BASIL & CHIVES
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Fresh green beans
1/4 c  Olive oil
1    Clove garlic, crushed
1 tb Chopped chives
1/4 c  Diced green pepper
1/4 c  Diced red pepper
1/4 c  Diced yellow pepper
1/2 c  Boiling water
1 ts Salt
2 tb Fresh basil minced
1/2 c  Grated Paremesan cheese
For this dish, only use the freshest ingredients, and use only fresh
herbs. If fresh herbs are not available, it simply will not be the
same. For a nice aesthetic touch, reserve a teaspoon of each color of
diced pepper and a few pinches of chopped chives. Also save a sprig
or two of the fresh basil (the centerpiece that looks like a flower
of leaves would do nicely). When the dish is placed in it's serving
dish, sprinkle the peppers, and chives over the cheese and top with
sprigs of basil.
******************************************************* *************
You may use 3/4 cup diced green pepper instead of 1/4 cup of each
green, red and yellow, or any combination thereof if the yellow
and/or the red are not available, but they add a touch of color and
distinction to the dish. Take fresh young beans and remove stem and
any strings (the young ones shouldn't have much of a string to worry
about). Break them in half (or so the segments are a couple of inches
long). Heat oil and garlic in a large frying pan (make sure it is
large enough to hold all the beans). When the oil becomes hot, add
the peppers and cook slowly for 3 minutes. Add the beans, water,
salt, basil and chives and turn everything over until the herbs and
peppers are well distributed over the beans. Cover and simmer until
the beans have turned a bright green and are al'dente (tender but
still crisp; which should take about 5 minutes). Mix in 1/4 cup
cheese and sprinkle 1/4 cup on top. If you've reserved some of the
diced peppers, chives and whole basil leaves, garnish the top of the
dish with these.
