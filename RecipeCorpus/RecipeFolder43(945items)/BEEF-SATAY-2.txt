Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes and place in a bowl or plastic bag. In
a 2-cup measure, combine the soy sauce, honey, lime juice, curry and
chili powders, onion and garlic. Blend thoroughly and pour over the
meat. Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature. Thread the meat on
bamboo skewers, soaked in water to prevent charring, or on small
metal skewers. Push the meat close together if some rare portions are
wanted or space it slightly for well done meat.  Grill 2 to 3 inches
above hot coals until done as desired, about 8 minutes total cooking
time for medium-rare.
