1 1/2 lb Lean Ground Beef
1 lg Egg; Slightly Beaten
1 ts Salt

Cut the onions in half crosswise, pull of the skins, and scoop out the
centers. leaving sturdy shells. Chop the scooped-out onion. Combine
the beef, egg, salt, 3/4 cup of sauce and the chopped onion. Blend
well and shape into 6 large meatballs.  Cut 6 squares of heavy duty
foil, large enough to contain each onion half, and on each of the
squares. Put a meatball in each onion half and spoon a little of the
sauce over the combination.  Fold the foil up around the onions and
seal tightly, allowing space in the foil packets for steam. Grill 4
to 6 inches above the hot coals about 30 minutes. Protecting the
hands with mitts, peel back the foil so tops of the meat and onions
are exposed. Baste with the drippings in the foil packets or with
additional sauce. Cover the grill or shape a loose tent of foil over
the onions and continue cooking 25 minutes longer or until the onions
are as tender as desired and the meat is done to your taste.
