Title: BEEF LOAF (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
4 lg Eggs -- slightly beaten
2 2/3 c  Milk
12 sl Bread -- diced
1/4 c  Instant minced onion
1 c  Celery -- finely chopped
4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 c  Catsup
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
6 lb Lean ground beef
Preheat oven to 375B0 F. (moderate).  Have four 8x8x2-inch baking pans
ready.  Do not line pans for this recipe.

Mix eggs and milk.  Add remaining ingredients except meat. Beat well.
Mix in meat lightly.  Divide mixture into four parts. Press each part
into a baking pan. Pack mixture tightly to avoid air pockets. Bake 1
hour or until loaf is done.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Serve immediately after removing from the
oven.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Remove from pans
and place on freezer wrap.  Allow extra wrap to fold over top.
Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of
wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze
immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 375B0 F. (hot). Remove freezer
wrap. Place food in baking pan.  Bake 1 hour or until center is hot.
