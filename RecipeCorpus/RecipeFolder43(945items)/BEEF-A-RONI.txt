Categories: Meats, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings

Brown ground beef in a large frying pan. Add spaghetti sauce, tomato
sauce, corn, sliced mushrooms and chopped onion. Simmer until the
mushrooms are cooked. Add seasonings and continue to simmer. In a
large pot cook the shells and drain. Mix sauce with shells and serve.
Leftovers are even better and I always make extra. From: Syd's
