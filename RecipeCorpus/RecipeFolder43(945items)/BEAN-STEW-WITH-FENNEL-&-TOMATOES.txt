Preparation Time: 25 minutes Soaking Time: several hours Cooking
Time: 1 hour

1. Soak beans in a large bowl of water to cover for several hours or
overnight.  Drain.

2. Place soaked beans into a pot with stock or broth and enough water
to cover by 2 inches.  Add bay leaf and whole garlic cloves. Heat to
a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until beans
are tender (about 45 minutes).  (The beans should be softer than al
dente but not cooked to the point where they begin to disintegrate.)
Don't drain beans until fennel and tomato sauce is cooked.

3. Meanwhile, cut stalks off fennel bulb.  Chop the feathery leaves
and reserve.  Trim off root end of the bulbs; cut bulbs in half
lengthwise and slice thinly. There should be about 8 cups of fennel
slices. Discard stalks or save for soup.  Heat 1/3 cup olive oil in a
large heavy skillet; cook fennel over medium-low heat until wilted
and translucent, about 10-12 minutes.  Do this in batches if
necessary.

4. Add tomato to fennel; cook 5 or 6 minutes.  Discard garlic and bay
leaf from beans; drain beans.  Add beans to the skillet, tossing
gently to combine all the ingredients. Add parsley and chopped fennel
leaves. Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat, add lemon
juice and remaining olive oil to taste. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
