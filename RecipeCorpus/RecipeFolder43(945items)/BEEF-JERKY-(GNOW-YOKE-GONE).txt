Chinese Beef Jerky is a favorite snack in China. The flavor is a bit
on the sweet side compared to its western counterpart and definitely
not spicy. You can purchase ready made jerkies in Chinatown. However,
in case there is not one near you, here's a home made recipe Ms. Yee
enjoys sharing. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for MM
