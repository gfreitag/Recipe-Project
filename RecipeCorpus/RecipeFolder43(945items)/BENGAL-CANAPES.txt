Title: BENGAL CANAPES
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 16 Servings
8 sl Bread
1 tb Butter
4 oz Chopped ham
1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
Mango chutney
Grated Parmesan cheese
Paprika to taste
Make toasted bread croutons:  Using a small glass, cut 2-inch rounds
out of slices of bread (you'll get about two per slice). Lightly
toast both sides of bread.

Heat butter, ham and cheese together.  Spread on toasted bread
croutons. Top with a dab of mango chutney and grated Parmesan cheese.

Brown slightly under broiler.  Sprinkle with a little paprika and
serve hot.

Note:  If you make your own French bread, make a loaf smaller in
diameter. Freeze, then slice frozen to crouton thickness or thinner.
Makes for better base.
