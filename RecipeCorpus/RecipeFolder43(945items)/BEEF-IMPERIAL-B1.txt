Title: BEEF IMPERIAL B1
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 lb Semi-frozen flank steak
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1    Egg
Salt & pepper; to taste
1 ts Cornstarch
2 c  Oil
Imperial sauce
5    Dry black chinese mushrooms
- (originally: "5 to 6")
- soaked in warm water
- 20 minutes, drained,
- remove stems and slice
1 c  Bamboo shoots, sliced
3 sl Ginger
2    Garlic cloves; sliced.
Handful of fresh snow peas,
- stringed
Oriental sesame oil
- optional
Remove fat, muscle & any gristle from meat. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise.
Slice each piece crosswise, against the grain & on a slight slant, so
you have 1/4-in. slices. Place in bowl & marinate for 1 hr. in soy
sauce, sherry, egg, salt, pepper & cornstarch. Heat a wok hot & dry.
Add oil. When it's just beginning to smoke, add meat mixture,
stirring it quickly so the pieces separate. After 1 minutes, drain
through a colander or sieve, reserving 2-3 tbs. oil.

Prepare the Imperial Sauce.

Return reserved oil to the wok. Add mushrooms, bamboo shoots, ginger,
garlic, snow peas & meat. Move wok back & forth rapidly in the air so
the vegetables are flipped into the air continuously. Add Imperial
Sauce & continue flipping vegetables & meat 3 minutes or until the
sauce thickens. If desired, sprinkle a few drops of sesame oil on
mixture. Serve.

Don't mistake Oriental for American sesame oil. They are totally
different.
