750 g  Cuttlefish or squid
1/3 c  Olive oil
Water
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
750 g  Spinach
1 c  Chopped spring onions
1/2    Lemon (juice only)
Cuttlefish (soupies) as distinct from squid (kalamaria) are preferred
for this dish, though either may be used. Cleaning cuttlefish can be
a rather messy business as these marine molluscs have an ink sac from
which the pigment sepia is obtained.  The sac ruptures easily and is
usually ruptured by the time you purchase them, so don't be put off
by their colour ~ the ink rinses off easily.

Rinse cuttlefish or squid and remove head, attached tentacles and
intestines; discard intestines.  Pull out cuttle bone or fine
transparent bone if squid is being prepared. Pull off fine skin and
rinse. Remove eyes and beak from head, leave head attached to
tentacles and pull or rub off skin from tentacles, or as much skin as
will easily come off.

Slice hood or body into strips.  If squid are large, slice head and
tentacles - cuttlefish tentacles are usually small and these are left
intact.  Place prepared cuttlefish or squid in pan and set on medium
heat. Cover and cook for 15 minutes in its own juice. Add half the
oil, just enough water to cover, and salt and pepper to taste, cover
and simmer gently for 45 minutes or until tender.

Meanwhile trim spinach and wash thoroughly.  Drain well and chop
leaves and stalks coarsely.

Heat remaining oil in a separate pan and gently fry spring onion until
soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts. Add spinach
mixture to cuttlefish or squid with lemon juice and adjust seasonings
with salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer for further 10-15 minutes.
Serve hot.
