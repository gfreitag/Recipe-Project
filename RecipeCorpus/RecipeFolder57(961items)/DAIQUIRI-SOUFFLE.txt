Title: DAIQUIRI SOUFFLE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Cold water
1 tb Unflavoured gelatin
4 ea Large eggs, separated
3/4 c  Sugar
1 ea Rind of lemon and lime
2 tb Lime juice
2 tb Lemon juice
4 tb Light rum
1 c  Whipped cream
Put water in a pan.  Sprinkle gelatin on top; let stand at least 5
minutes. Beat egg yolks and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Add
lime and lemon rind; mix to blend.  Cook gelatin mixture over low
heat until dissolved. Add egg yolk mixture; cook gently, stirring
constantly, 3 to 5 minutes. Don't let mixture boil or it may curdle.
Remove from heat; stir in rum, lemon and lime juices.  Cool until
just beginning to gel. This can be hastened by setting bowl on bed of
ice.
Stir occasionally to prevent jelly forming.  Whisk cream in bowl
until soft peaks form.  Fold whipped cream and beaten egg whites into
gelatin mixture. Pour into prepared dish. Chill. Decorate with
whipped cream, violets, and lime slices.
