thaw if frozen.  Cook pasta, drain and cool. Poach chicken in

To prepare sauce, add first 7 ingredients to a blender and process on

In a cup, combine oils and drizzle into blender mixture while
blending at low speed.

In a large bowl combine blanched or thawed corn, cooked pasta, celery,
cilantro and 3/4 of the sauce. Chop chicken and arrange with snow
peas over the pasta mixture. Top with remaining sauce and toasted
sesame seeds. Serve chilled or at room temperature
