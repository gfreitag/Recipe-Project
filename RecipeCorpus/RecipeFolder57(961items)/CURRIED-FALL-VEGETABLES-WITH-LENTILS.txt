Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Lentils, red
2    Onions; chopped
1 tb Cumin, ground
2 ts Black pepper
2 tb Lemon juice
1    Pepper squash, or other
-winter squash
1    Sweet pepper, red

1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
2 1/2 c  Chicken or vegetable stock
1 sm Cauliflower
1/2 lb Green beans
1/2 c  Peanuts
Pick over lentils for small stones or impurities. Wash them in a sieve
under cold running water.  Drain well and set aside.

In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat and saute onions and
garlic about 3 minutes or until softened. Stir in cumin, coriander,
turmeric, pepper and chilies. Cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Stir in
lentils to coat well with oil.  Stir in lemon juice and stock. Bring
to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, peel squash and cut into 1 inch pieces. You should have
about 4 cups.  Cut cauliflower into small florets, about 6 cups
worth. Cut red pepper into thin strips. Trim beans and cut in two.
Stir squash and cauliflower into lentil mixture. Bring to a boil
again, reduce heat. Cover and simmer another 5 minutes. Stir in red
pepper and beans and simmer 5 minutes longer.  Stir in salt and
peanuts.

Cook, uncovered, about another 5 minutes, or until all vegetables are
tender and lentils have formed a thick sauce. Adjust seasonings to
taste. Serve over hot rice. The curry will thicken if made ahead and
reheated. Add more stock or water if necessary. Submitted By SAM
