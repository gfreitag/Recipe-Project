Title: DEATH BY VANILLA PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 20 Servings
1 c  Tapioca; small pearl
1 qt Whole cream
2 c  Water
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Sugar; brown
4    Eggs; large
3 ts Vanilla; madagascar bourbon
soak tapioca in 2 cups cold water in refrigerator overnight. Drain and
place in a large sauce pan with cream and 2 cups water. Bring to a
boil, add sugar and vanilla slowly, stirring the whole time (it will
get very thick very fast and lump if you don't)   Beat eggs to a
froth, add to pudding mixture.  Simmer for 5 minutes (until eggs are
set with the rest of the pudding) Chill overnight, warm each serving
(microwave works best) and serve. This is a very rich pudding. Most
people will not want very much, however they will savor each bite! If
you do not chill the pudding overnight you are missing the chance to
taste the best vanilla pudding you have ever allowed you pallet to
enjoy. The vanilla called for in the recipe may be purchased through
williams sonoma (direct or mail order) or may be replaced with any
GOOD real vanilla extract such as found in many fine cooking stores.
I have tried it with "american" vanilla extracts but keep returning
to the madagascar.
