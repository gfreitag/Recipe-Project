Chop the onion, the leek, and the scallions.  Reserve a little of the
grenner parts of the scallions for garnish. Grate the squashes, seeds
and all.  In a heavy pot melt the sweet butter. When the butter foams
and is quite fragrant, add curry powder, and cook while stirring for
2 or 3 minutes.  Add the onions, leeks, scallions, and squash, and
season to taste with salt and pepper. Saute this mixture briefly,
then turn down the heat, cover, and cook until squash is soft and
juices have been extracted. Uncover, and evaporate half of the juice.
Add the chicken stock and potatoes.  Cook uncovered for 15 minutes,
or until potatoes are just cooked through. To Serve: Hot, country
style - add the heavy cream and serve in warmed soup bowls.  Pureed -
chilled or hot - let the soup mixture cool, then puree in batches in
food processor or blender. Strain the puree. Stir in heavy cream.
Serve iced or heated. Garnish with reserved scallions. By Chef Deedy
