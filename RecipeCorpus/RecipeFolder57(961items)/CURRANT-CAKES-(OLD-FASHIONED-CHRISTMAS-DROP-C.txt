1 lb Sugar
1 lb Butter
6 ea Egg
3/4 lb Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 lb Currants
1 ea Lemon, juice of
1 ea Lemon, rind of
Mix the currants with some of the flour. Work butter and sugar
together to a smooth cream, then slowly work in whole eggs one at a
time. Add a little of the flour, rind and juice of the lemon and
salt. Work in slowly the rest of the flour and the currants. Drop by
spoonfuls on large buttered pans, pressing flat with a knife as the
cakes are better when very thin. A good plan is to heat the pan a bit
and allow the cakes to melt as much as possible before putting them
in the oven to bake. Be sure to butter the pans thoroughly;
otherwise, the thin cakes will be difficult to remove. (recipe didn't
include baking time or temp). Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book -
