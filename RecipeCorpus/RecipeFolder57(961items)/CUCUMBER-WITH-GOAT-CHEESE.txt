This ultra-simple entree depends absolutely on the quality of its
ingredients.  The cucumbers must be at their peak, the goat cheese
the best you can buy and the oil hazelnut if possible but, in any
case, a well-flavoured nut oil.  As hazelnut oil can be difficult to
find, you could substitute a walnut or macadamia nut oil.

Score 750 g of cucumbers lengthwise with the tines of a fork or peel
them if you prefer.  Slice paper thin, put in a colander, sprinkle
with salt and let them degorge for half an hour.

Turn out of the colander, rinse and dry with paper towels. In a bowl
toss the slices with 50 mL lemon juice, then arrange them on six
plates. Dust with white pepper.

Cut about 100 to 120 g firm goat cheese into thin slices and arrange
two or three on each plate. Sprinkle 50 mL of hazelnut oil over the
six servings.

Makes 6 servings.
