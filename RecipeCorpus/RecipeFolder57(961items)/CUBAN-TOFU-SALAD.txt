Ingredients:

firm tofu 1/3 cup nutritional yeast with salt, pepper, and
1 lb
paprika added to taste oil 1 lb new potatoes 1 goodsized sweet potato

good), sliced or chopped 4 eggs, hard cooked, sliced 1/2 cup green
peas, cooked until still slightly firm 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
1 can asparagus tips mayonnaise (about 3/4 c.) about 2 tblsp dill
weed vinegar, mustard, or "Durkee's special sauce" 1. Cut tofu into
1" squares, 1/2" thick. Coat with nutritional yeast. Fry in oil over
medium heat until golden brown and slightly chewy. Drain on paper
towels.

2.  Cut potatoes and sweet potatoes into 1" cubes. Boil until tender.
Drain.

3.  Mix together tofu, potatoes, apple, 3 of the eggs, peas, and
onion. Add enough mayonnaise to make it creamy or to taste. Add dill
weed, fresh if possible. Add enough vinegar, prepared mustard, or
Durkee's Sauce (basically a mustardvinegar sauce) to give it a tang.

4.  Garnish with additional egg and asparagus spears. Sprinkle with
paprika for beauty.

Variations and substitutions:

Broil the tofu to reduce fat.  It won't have a nicy chewy texture,
though. Substitute chicken for the tofu (as in the original recipe).
Substitute plain, nonfat yogurt for some of the mayonnaise to reduce
fat content. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
