This version of a Malaysian classic is both rich and subtle.

Furthermore, with a food processor, it is quite simple to prepare.
Disjoint a chicken, then chop the resulting pieces in half. In a food
processor, process the flesh of half a small coconut to shreds.

Toast it, stirring, in a dry frying pan until it is light brown.
Return it to the processor and process it with 700 ml thin coconut
milk. Set aside.

Wash the processor bowl and blade, and process to a paste 2 brown
onions, 6 cloves garlic, 5 fresh red chillies, 2 cm ginger, 2 cm
cinnamon stick, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 2 tablespoons coriander, 2
teaspoons cummin, a pinch of mustard seeds, 1 teaspoon cardamom, 1
teaspoon turmeric and a 2 cm cube of blachan (dark, hardened shrimp
paste). Juice a lemon.

Heat 3 tablespoons of oil or copha (coconut fat) in a saucepan and
fry the spice paste until it smells fragrant. Add the chicken pieces,
the coconut mixture and the lemon juice and simmer without a lid for
about
45    minutes to 1 hour.

Serve with rice and garnish with deep fried onion flakes.

Makes 4 servings.
