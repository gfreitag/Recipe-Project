Title: CRUNCHY OATMEAL COOKIES
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Uncooked Quick Oats
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
1 c  Packed brown sugar
1/2 c  White granulated sugar
3/4 c  Shortening
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Molasses
raisins, nuts, chocolate chips, birdseed, etc.

Preheat oven to 350 F

Mix dry ingredients.  Cream together sugars, shortening, vanilla,
molasses. Mix in dry ingredients until mixed. Add "extras" --
raisins, nuts, chips, etc. (I like pecans and chocolate chips). Roll
tablespoons of the batter into little balls (the molasses will make a
mess out of your hands -- I have to wash them a few times) about 3/4"
or 1" in diameter; place on a greased cookie sheet. Press them down
with your fingers to flatten them, and put them in the oven for 11-13
minutes. If you bake them at a bit lower than 350 you can do it
longer and they get more crispy. Remove from oven and let sit for a
minute or two so they don't fall apart when you cool them on a wire
rack.

Enjoy!
