1 c  sour cream -- optional

In a medium-large saucepan, saute the onions and scallions in butter
until golden brown.  Stir in the pumpkin. Add the chicken broth, bay
leaf, brown sugar, curry powder, nutmeg, and parsley and simmer,
uncovered, for 15 minutes. Transfer the soup to a food processor and
puree with the half-and-half or chicken stock to reach the desired
consistency, creamy with medium density. Add salt and pepper to
taste. Serve with a handful of roasted pumpkin seeds or chopped
chives. A small dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche may also be
used to garnish. How to Cook Your Pumpkin: One 3-pound pumpkin
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the pumpkin in half vertically
and discard the seeds and stringy pulp. Place the pumpkin, cut-sides
down, in a shallow baking dish and add water about a 1/2 inch high.
Bake for about 1 hour or until tender. The pumpkin is ready when it
is easily pierced with a fork. Cut each half into wedges and peel. A
3-pound pumpkin yields about 3 pounds cooked.
