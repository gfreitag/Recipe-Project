Title: DATE TAPIOCA
Categories: Desserts, Low-cal
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Egg, separated
2 c  Skim milk
3 tb Tapioca
1/8 ts Salt
12    Dates, quartered
3/4 ts Vanilla
Beat egg yolk.  Mix in saucepan with milk, tapioca and salt. Let
stand 5 min.

Beat egg white until stiff.  Set aside.  (My note:  my mixer will
beat a large egg white but not a medium one.)

Bring tapioca mixture to a boil over medium heat.  Add dates and cook,
stirring constantly 6 to 8 minutes or until thick. Remove from heat,
add vanilla.  Gently fold tapioca mixture into egg white.

Cool at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Refrigerate until
chilled.
