Title: CURRY POWDER (SAROJINI MUDNANI'S #2)
Categories: Mix, Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Cloves
1 oz Cinnamon
4 oz Black pepper
1 oz Mace
1 oz Cardamom
4 oz Cummin seed
1/2 oz Dry bay leaves
Mix these spices together, and roast in a moderate oven, or parch dry
in a large frying pan. The spices should be heated until they give
off a rich aroma, but not burnt. Grind thoroughly (we use an old
coffee grinder) and pass through a fine sieve (regrinding if
necessary). Keep in an airtight stoppered bottle in a dark cool
place, where the curry powder will improve for a year or so.

This recipe will seem milder and more mellow than Sarojini Mudnani #1
curry powder to those not used to the heat of curries, though the use
of coriander and fenugreek will give the first a distinctive flavour.
