A Cuban friend gave me this recipe and I adapted it to a pressure
cooker (I also removed all references to olive oil).

2   cups black beans 5 cups water

Put cleaned, washed beans in a 4 to 6 qt. pressure cooker. Boil beans
for 2 minutes; turn heat off, cover beans and let sit for 1 hours.

Add the following ingredients:

1   or  2 bell peppers, chopped l large onion, chopped 4 cloves
garlic, minced 1/2 tsp pepper salt or to taste 1 tsp oregano 1 bay
leaf 2 tbsp sugar

Cook at 15 lbs pressure for 25 to 30 min.   Open cooker when the
indicator has dropped down.

Remove about 1/2 to 1 cup of the beans and mash; return to pot and
add the following ingredients:

2   tbsp vinegar 2 tbsp red wine (cooking wine ok)

Bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 min.

Serve over white rice.
