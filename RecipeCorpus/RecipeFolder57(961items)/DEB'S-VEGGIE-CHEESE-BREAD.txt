Categories: Breads, Dkuhnen msn, Breadmaker
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  V-8 juice, warmed to room
Temperature
1/4 c  Feta cheese, chopped
3 tb Freshly chopped basil leaves
1 tb Chopped scotch bonnet pepper
(jalapeno would work too)
3 tb Chopped pitted black olives
1 tb Olive oil
3/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Sugar
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour

I did this on the fast bread program in my breadmaker (2 hours 40 mins
including cooling time.)  It made a really great tasting, moist loaf!
My husband raved about it and insisted I share the recipe. Hope you
like it!.
