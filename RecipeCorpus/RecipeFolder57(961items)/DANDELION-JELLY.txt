Title: DANDELION JELLY
Categories: Desserts, Jams
Yield: 6 Servings
1 qt Dandelion blossoms
2 qt Water
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 3/4 oz Powdered fruit pectin
5 1/2 c  Sugar
Pick bright, fresh dandelion blossoms and pack the quart container
pretty tightly.  This is going to require a lot of dandelion
blossoms! Rinse quickly in cold water to remove any insects/dirt on
the petals. Don't leave the blossoms in the water for very long
though, as they will be a little the worse for wear.

Next, pull up a chair somewhere comfortable, as this part is going to
take awhile...Snip off the stem and green collar under each blossom,
so that only the petals are left. This takes about four hours!

In an enamel saucepan, boil the dandelion petals in water for 3
minutes, or a little longer, until the water takes on their color. (I
boiled the petals for 4 minutes until I liked the color better.)

Cool and strain, pressing against the petals with your fingers to
extract all of the dandelion juice.  (Or you can cheat and line a
sieve with moistened cheesecloth and strain it that way.)

Measure out 3 cups of dandelion liquid.  Add the lemon juice and fruit
pectin.  Stir to combine.

Bring to a boil, using a large kettle.  Add the sugar, stirring to mix
well. Continue stirring and boil the mixture for 2 and 1/2 minutes.

Pour into hot sterilized jelly jars and seal.  Process for five
minutes in a boiling water bath.

Yield:  Five 1/2 pint jars.
