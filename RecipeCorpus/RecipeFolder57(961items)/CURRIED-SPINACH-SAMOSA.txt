Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Recipe
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 c  Water
1/3 c  Organic safflower oil
1 pn Salt
3 c  Whole wheat flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 tb Sesame oil
1 bn Green onion; finely chopped
3 md Carrots; diced
1 lb Fresh spinach
-- washed, dried & chopped
1 pn Salt
1/4 ts Curry powder
1 tb Tamari
1/4 c  Water
1 tb Kudzu (Japanese arrowroot)
Combine water, oil, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.
Remove from heat and beat the mixture with a whisk until it has a
milky appearance. Add to flour in a large bowl. Gently knead the
dough just until mixed well. Form into a ball and let sit for 30
minutes (or cover and place in a refrigerator until needed and then
bring to room temperature.) For the filling: heat oil in a skillet.
Saute onions and carrots for 1 minute. Sprinkle with salt and curry
powder and add chopped spinach. Cover and steam over medium heat
until spinach wilts and the carrots are tender, about 4 minutes.
Season with tamari. Dissolve kudzu in 1/4 cup water, add to spinach
mixture, and cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly, to thicken
and glaze. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Divide the dough in half and
roll out until about 1/8" thick. Using a saucer or a small plate as a
guide cut the dough into 4" circles. Place 2 Tbs. of filling in the
middle of each circle. Fold over and pinch edge shut. Using a fork,
poke a few holes in each samosa. Place on an oiled cookie sheet and
bake for 30 minutes. Delicious hot or cold.
