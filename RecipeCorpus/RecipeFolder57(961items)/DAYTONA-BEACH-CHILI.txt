Brown meat, onions, garlic in olive oil, drain. Return to pot and add
all other ingredients. Bring to a boil. Turn heat down and simmer for
about 2 1/2 hours. Mix the cornmeal and beef stock and add to pot.
Cook this the day before it is served. CROCK POT: Place all
ingredients in crock pot. Add meat and cook on high 4 hours or on low
for 8 hours. After 3 hours on high or 6 hours on low mix the
cornmeal, if needed with the beef stock and add to pot. This is the
first time I tried this chili. It was cooked in the crock pot because
Sears tried to deliver a damaged stove on 02/17/94. Chili was cooked
on 02/19/94. The Daytona 500 is on Sunday the 20th. We will have ribs
cooked in the Nesco. Linda made her potato salad and we will have
this chili. NOTE: The crock pot was to full, use less meat or less
liquid. NOTE: Chili was no good! We mixed it with dry dog food and
gave it to the dogs. The meat must be browned before it is put in the
C/P.
