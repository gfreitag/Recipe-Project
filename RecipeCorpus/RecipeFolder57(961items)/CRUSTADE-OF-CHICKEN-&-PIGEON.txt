Title: CRUSTADE OF CHICKEN & PIGEON
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
12 oz Wholewheat pastry
1    Pigeon
2    Chicken breasts
Or whole legs
2/3 c  Dry white wine
-several grinds of black
-pepper
4    Cloves
1/2 oz Butter
2 oz Mushrooms, roughly chopped
1 oz Raisins
3 lg Eggs
-salt
-pepper
1/2 ts Ground ginger
Roll out 8 oz of the pastry and line a 8 inch flan dish; back the
crust blind. Put the pigeon in a pot with the stock, wine, pepper and
cloves and cook very slowly for an hour. Add the chicken and continue
to cook for a further 45 minutes or till the meat of both birds is
really tender. Meanwhile cook the mushrooms lightly in the butter.
Remove the birds from the stock and bone them. Cut the flesh into
quite small pieces, mix it with the mushrooms and the raisins and
spread them over the base of the flan case. Beat the eggs with a fork
and season with the salt, pepper, and ginger. Add 1 cup of the
cooking juices and pour over the meat in the flan case. If you want
to have a lid, roll out the rest of the pastry and cover the flan.
Bake it in moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes if uncovered, 35
minutes if covered. Serve warm with a good green salad. For a more
20th century flavor-- double the chicken, leave out the pigeon, and
substitute 1 oz chopped fried bacon for the raisins.
