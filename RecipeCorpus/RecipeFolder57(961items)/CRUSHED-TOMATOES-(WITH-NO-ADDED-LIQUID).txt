Title: CRUSHED TOMATOES (WITH NO ADDED LIQUID)
Categories: Vegetables, Fruits, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  A high-quality product, ideally suited for use in soups, stews, and
casseroles. This recipe is similar to that formerly referred to as
"Quartered Tomatoes."

Quantity: An average of 22 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 14 fresh pounds is needed per canner load of 9
pints. A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 17 to 20 quarts of
crushed tomatoes--an average of 2-3/4 pounds per quart.

Procedure: Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30 to 60
seconds or until skins split. Then dip in cold water slip off skins,
and remove cores. Trim off any bruised or discolored portions and
quarter. Heat one-sixth of the quarters quickly in a large pot,
crushing them with a wooden mallet or spoon as they are added to the
pot. This will exude juice. Continue heating the tomatoes, stirring
to prevent burning. Once the tomatoes are boiling, gradually add
remaining quartered tomatoes, stirring constantly These remaining
tomatoes do not need to be crushed. They will soften with heating and
stirring. Continue until all tomatoes are added. Then boil gently 5
minutes. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid to jars (See
acidification directions). Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the
jars, if desired. Fill jars immediately with hot tomatoes, leaving
1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process. Recommended process
times are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

section of the guide appears to contain some sort of error in the
information given within Table 3 above. In the USDA book, there are
only TWO sizes of jars specified in the table, but there are THREE
separate lines of figures in the table, and it is not completely
clear which jar size the second and third entries refer to. I have
given the second entry's numbers as those to be used for Quart jars,
and below I have reprinted the third entry on the table, for an
unknown jar size.
