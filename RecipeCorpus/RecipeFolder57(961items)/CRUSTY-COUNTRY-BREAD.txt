Title: CRUSTY COUNTRY BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Envelope dry yeast
1/3 c  Warm water (105-115 F)
4 c  Hard wheat white flour
2 ts Sugar (optional)
2 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Warm water (120-130 F)
Makes 2 baguettes or 1 long or round loaf

Lightly grease large bowl; set aside.

Stir yeast into 1/3 cup water and let stand until mixture bubbles,
about 5 to 7 minutes.  Combine with flour in mixing bowl. Begin
beating, adding sugar, salt and remaining water, and continue beating
until well mixed.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, turning to coat
entire surface.  Cover with plastic wrap and hot, damp towel and let
stand in warm place until almost tripled in volume.  When dough has
risen, transfer to board, punch down and knead about 2 minutes to
eliminate any air bubbles. Return to bowl, cover and let rise again
until at least doubled.

Preheat oven to 425 F.  Grease baking sheet.  On lightly floured
board, punch dough down, roll into oval, then form into desired
shape. Make several slashes diagonally across top with knife or
scissors. Place on baking sheet and let rise until loaf is doubled.
Bake 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 F and bake 5 to 10 minutes more
for baguettes, or 15 minutes for single loaf, until golden brown and
bread gives hollow sound when tapped on bottom. Cool on rack.

Bon Appetit
