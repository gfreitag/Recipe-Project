medium-sized bowl, combine the pork with soy sauces, rice wine,
sesame oil and cornstarch and set aside. Peel the cucumbers, split
them in half, and with a spoon, scoop out the seeds. Then finely
slice the cucumber. Heat a wok or large saute pan until it is hot.
Add the oil, then chili bean sauce, garlic, Sichuan peppercorns,
chili flakes and salt, and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Then add the
pork; stir-fry 1 minute. Add cucumbers; stir-fry for 1 minute. Pour
in soy sauce, wine, vinegar and sugar. Stir-fry 2 minutes, or until
all the liquid has evaporated. Serve at once.
