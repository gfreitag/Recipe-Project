Title: DANA'S NEW TRADITIONAL RELISH.
Categories: Sauces, Holiday, Fruits
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Part cranberries
2    Parts apples *
1    Sugar
*cooked with a bit of cider, spiced with cinnamon and ground cloves.
sweetening this year, instead of 1 part sugar, I used maple syrup. The
relish is quite tart this way, but it's how our family likes it. Have
a happy, delicious holiday.
