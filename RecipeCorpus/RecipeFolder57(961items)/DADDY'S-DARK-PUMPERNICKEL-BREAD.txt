Title: DADDY'S DARK PUMPERNICKEL BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 c  Bread Flour
2 ts Brown sugar
3/4 c  Rye Flour
2/3 ts Instant Coffee granules
1/2 c  Whole Wheat Flour
2 ts Caraway seeds (opt)
1 tb Dry Milk
1 1/2 tb Cocoa powder
1 ts Salt
2 tb Molasses, dark
1 tb Butter
7 1/2 oz Water
3 tb Cornmeal
1 ts Yeast
Add ingredients to your bread machine in recommended order. In the
Panasonic, add the dry ingredients first, then the liquids. If using
Fleishmans yeast, increase amount!

This will make a 1 lb. loaf. (Tested and created by Robert Birr,
using a composite of the Panasonic manual--some people do read
manuals!--, Donna German's receipe and probably more of his
imagination than he gives himself credit for!)
