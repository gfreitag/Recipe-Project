Title: DAVE'S GRAPE-PUDDING-TART
Categories: Dupree
3 c  seedless green grapes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  sugar
2    egg yolks
1    egg
1/2 c  butter
1 c  flour
2 ts rum flavoring -- or 2
TB rum
1/4 ts almond extract
1 c  milk

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Sprinkle the grapes with half the sugar,
and let stand 30 minutes. For the batter, in a bowl beat together the
remaining sugar and egg yolks. Then beat in the egg. While beating,
gradually add the butter, then the flour. Finally, add the rum
flavoring, almond extract, and milk and beat until very smooth. May
be done in the food processor. Pour 1/3 of the batter into a heavily
buttered 8- or 9-inch baking dish or pie pan. Spoon the grapes and
their juice over the batter. Pour the remaining batter over the
grapes. Bake the tart on the lower rack of the oven for 40 minutes,
or until a toothpick comes out clean. The texture should be soft and
nearly custardy. Cool slightly and serve from the pan in wedges or
squares. May be done several days in advance. Serve warm, heated, or
at room temperature. Yield: 4 to 6 servings
