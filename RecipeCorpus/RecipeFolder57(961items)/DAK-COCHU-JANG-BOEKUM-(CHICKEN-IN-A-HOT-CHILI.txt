"Koreans in the southern part of the country like salty and chili-hot
foods. The cities of Kwangju and Chongju in the southwest Korea,
where I spent some culinary research time, are centers for this hot
salty dish."

1. Cut the chicken into 3-inch pieces. Divide the wings. Mix the
parts with the sugar and marinate for 1 hour or more (the sugar is a
tenderizer).

2. Mix together all the other seasonings -- garlic, scallion, ginger,
soy sauce, gochu jang, sesame oil and sesame seeds. Mix well, add to
the chicken, and marinate for another hour.

3. Pour the 1/2 cup of water into a pan and bring to a boil. Add the
chicken and marinade and simmer, covered, over low heat for about 1/2
hour, which is enough to cook the chicken and evaporate nearly all
the liquid. Stir the mixture once or twice during this process.

Serve warm with rice, salads and kimchi.
