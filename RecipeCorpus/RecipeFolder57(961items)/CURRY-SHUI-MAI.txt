Title: CURRY SHUI MAI
Categories: Chiles, Chinese, Poultry, Turkey
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 lb Ground turkey
5 tb Corn starch
5 tb Water
3 tb Sherry
3 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
8 oz Whole water chestnuts,
Finely chopped
6    Scallions chopped
Including greens
2    Eggs
4 ts Curry powder,
Madras brand
Gyoza wrappers
(Sun Luck Brand)
Stir all ingredients very well.

Add curry powder, mix in very well

Fold into gyoza wrappers, about 1 tblsp in each. Leave the top open.
Served a lot for new years, as they look like purses, to insure
prosperity in the coming year.

We recommend Sun Luck brand gyoza wrappers as they are thinner than
most.

Steam 7 minutes, or until meat is cooked through, but not too long,
because it can lose flavor. WALT
