*DIRECTIONS* Under cold running water, wash the chilies and remove
their stems. Brush out any seeds that cling to the skin and break the
pods into small pieces.

To make red curry paste: combine the chilies, shallots (or scallions),
garlic, paprika, sereh, trassi, laso, caraway, coriander, lemon peel
and salt in the jar of an electric blender and blend at high speed
for 20 to 30 seconds. Turn off the machine, scrape down the sides of
the jar and blend again until the mixture is a smooth paste. Tightly
covered and refrigerated, the paste may be safely kept for a month or
so.

To make green curry paste: substitute 6 fresh hot green chilies
(about 2 inches long) for the dried red chilies and omit the paprika
from the recipe. Then follow the above directions precisely. Green
curry paste may be covered and refrigerated for about a month.

*VARIATIONS*

For a more fiery paste, include some seeds - the hottest part of the
chili.
