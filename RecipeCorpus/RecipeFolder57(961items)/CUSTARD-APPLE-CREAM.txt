Title: CUSTARD APPLE CREAM
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
3 ts Gelatine
1/3 c  Boiling water
500 g  Cream cheese, softened
1/2 c  Caster sugar
190 ml Cream
2 lg Custard apples
This dessert is related to cheesecake but while it has the latter's
richness, it is much more subtle. Because of that subtlety, it is
difficult to decorate in any way. At most, you could try some shaved
curls of white chocolate, but it is at its best with no more than a
thin topping of completely plain pouring cream.

Dissolve 3 teaspoons of gelatine in one third of a cup of boiling
water. Beat 500 grams of softened cream cheese thorough- ly, then add
the gelatine mixture, half a cup of caster sugar, 190 mL cream and
the pureed flesh of 2 fairly large custard apples. Beat until smooth
then pour into 8 dessert glasses or pots.

Refrigerate for 2-3 hours.
