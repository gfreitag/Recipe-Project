the squid.   Wash under cold running water and dry thoroughly. Remove
the skin from the snapper (ensure no bones remain) and cut the meat
into tiny pieces.  Crush the garlic.  Beat the egg whites lightly,
add the snapper and garlic and season with salt, white pepper and
nutmeg. Stir to blend thoroughly, then stuff the mixture into the
squid. Chop the shallots, chiles, candlenuts, and lemon grass, then
saute in very hot oil for three to four minutes. Add the coconut milk
and bring to the boil, then lower heat and add the stuffed squid.
Allow to simmer until the squid is very tender, approximately one
hour, then transfer to a serving dish and pour the sauce on top.
