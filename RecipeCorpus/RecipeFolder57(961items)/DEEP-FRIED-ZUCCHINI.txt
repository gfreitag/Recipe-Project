Title: DEEP FRIED ZUCCHINI
Categories: Side dish, Italian, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
250 g  Zucchini (small ones)
150 ml Soy milk
50 g  Flour
Salt & pepper, to taste
Oil for deep frying
Note. The zucchini should be reasonably small no longer than 6" (15
cm).

Trim the ends from the zucchini and cut them in half across (to give
two pieces around 3" long). Then cut each half into lengthwise slices
around 1/4" (6mm).

Season the flour generously with salt and pepper, and start heating
the oil. Dip the zucchini pieces into the milk, then into the
seasoned flour, shaking off any excess flour. As soon as you have
enough to make a batch, deep fry them in hot oil intol golden. Drain,
and serve as soon as possible. These zucchini do _not_ keep at all.
