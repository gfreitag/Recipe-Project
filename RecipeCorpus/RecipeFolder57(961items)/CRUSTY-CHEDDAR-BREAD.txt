++++++++++++++ ++++ Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let
stand 5 minutes. Gently stir to completely dissolve. With an electric
mixer, blend the softened yeast into the cottage cheese, sugar, salt
and egg. Add the flour in 1/2 cup portions to form a stiff but light
dough and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Butter a 1
1/2 quart casserole dish and stir the dough down, then add 1 cup of
the grated cheddar cheese. Turn into the buttered dish. Let rise 30
to 40 minutes longer or until almost doubled in size.  Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees F. and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until golden
brown. Brush the top with butter.
