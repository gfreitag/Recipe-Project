2 ea Unflavored Gelatin;Envelopes
1/2 c  Cold Water
4 oz Cream Cheese
4 oz Danish Blue Cheese
1 c  Heavy Cream
1 lb Seedless Green Grapes
*    Use 1 loaf (11 oz) of thin sliced pumpernickel bread. NOTE:
Since this is a Cheese pie rather than a cake, you will need one
9-inch pie tin.

First prepare the crust.  Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F, then dry
the bread slices in the oven until they are hard enough to crumble
easily, (about 20 to 25 minutes). Meanwhile melt the butter. Crush
the bread, making about 1 1/2 cups of crumbs.  Add the butter and the
sugar and mix very well.  Press the crumbs into the pie tin. Raise
the oven temperature to 35o degrees F. and bake the crust fro 15
minutes. Allow to cool before filling.  Then prepare the filling. In
a medium-sized saucepan, combine the gelatin with the water and cook
over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is
clear (about 6 to 8 minutes). Cool. In a large mixing bowl, beat the
cream cheese until light and smooth. Mash the blue cheese well and
combine with the cream cheese. Pour the gelatin mixture into the bowl
with the cheese and mix well. Whip the cream until stiff and fold
into the cheese mixture.  Pour the filling gently into the prepared
crust. Press the grapes upright into the pie, leaving the tops
showing. Chill the pie for several hours or until set.

NOTE:

Since there is no sugar in this recipe, all the sweetness comes from
the grapes, it is not as sweet as a cheesecake. If it is too tart for
you, add just a little sugar, but it is well liked by most as an
appetizer without any sugar added.
