Title: DEEP FRIED SHRIMP BALLS
Categories: Seafood, Oriental, Wok
Yield: 5 Servings
1 lb Shrimp, cleaned & deveined
2    Bacon strips
4    Water chestnuts
-OR
1/2 md Onion
Salt
Pepper
1    Egg, beaten
2 tb Corn starch
Oil for deep frying
1. Mince shrimp, bacon, onion or water chestnuts together until fine.
Place mixture in bowl. Remove crusts from bread. Dice bread into very
fine cubes. Place cubes in shrimp mixture. Add salt, pepper, egg and
2 tablespoons corn starch to mixture. Combine thoroughly.

2. Fill a wok halfway up with oil. Heat oil on highest heat setting.
When you think oil is sufficiently heated, test the temperature of it
with a small piece of bread crust. If it frys to a golden brown
colour, then oil is ready for deep frying. If bread crust fails to
brown readily, then oil is not ready yet. If bread crust frys to a
dark brown, then oil is too hot. Shut heat off of wok, allow oil to
cool 5 minutes before turning heat on again. Retest oil with bread
crust to see if it is of proper temperature.

3. When oil is ready for deep frying, take 2 teaspoons, dip into
shrimp mixture and form a 1" diameter ball. Drop ball into hot oil,
Place about 8 balls into the hot oil. Allow each ball to deep fry 3
minutes. Turn balls so that each will fry to a golden brown colour.
Remove balls to paper toweling to drain excess oil from them. Repeat
procedure for deep frying rest of shrimp mixture until all of the
mixture is used up. Place shrimp balls on a serving platter. Garnish
with parsley or other raw vegetable.
