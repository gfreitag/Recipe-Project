Title: DANDELION GREEN FETTUCCINI
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Dandelion greens
2    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
Some people find dandelion greens too strong simply added to a salad,
but here is a basic pasta recipe that uses them to the best effect.
It also works for other greens; beet greens, arugula, orach, or
chicory. It is so tasty that it needs only butter and grated Asiago
cheese. When making the pasta, adjust the amount of flour to the
moisture of the greens.

DIRECTIONS: =========== 1.) In a blender put dandelion greens and
eggs, blend until smooth.

2.) Transfer to a bowl, add salt and start adding flour while beating
with a spoon.  Keep adding until dough is stiff.

3.) Turn out onto floured surface and knead until smooth
(approximately 5 minutes).

4.) Roll out with rolling pin to 1/8"-1/4" thickness or thinner.

5.) Allow to stand and dry 1 hour, then cut into strips.

6.) Drop into boiling water and cook 1-2 minutes.
