This stock is one of the keys to achieving the "restaurant curry".

1. Mix the spices with water to make a paste the consistency of
catsup. Let it stand. 2. Heat 5 to 6 tablespoons of oil in a 6-8 pint
sauepan. Stir-fry the garlic puree for 30 seconds, then add the
ginger puree and cook for another 30 seconds. Add 5 to 6 more
tablespoons of oil and when hot addthe spice mixture and stir-fry for
another 30 seconds. Add the remaining oil and the onion puree and
stir-fry gently for about 10 minutes. 3. Puree the canned tomatoes in
a blender then add with the tomato paste to the pan. Mix in well and
add enough water to get a medium thick soup consistency. Add sugar
and salt to taste. 4. Simmer gently for at least 30 minutes and at
most 1 hour. Reduce to a thickish but easily pourable applesauce
texture. If it starts to get too dry add a little water. 5. Separate
into 10 equal portion and freeze in small freezer containers.

Substitute this curry gravy for the individual garlic, ginger and
onion purees in many recipes. This is just a mild base to which you
can add spices as required.
