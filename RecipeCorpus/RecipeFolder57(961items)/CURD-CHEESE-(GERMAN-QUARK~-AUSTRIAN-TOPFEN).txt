Title: CURD CHEESE (GERMAN QUARK~ AUSTRIAN TOPFEN)
Categories: Cheese, German
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM------------------OLD WORLD KITCHEN; LUARD-----------------------
4 tb Yogurt; or wine vinegar, or
5 tb Lemon juice
2 qt Milk
You will need a saucepan, a bowl, and a sieve.  If using yogurt,
bring the milk to a boil and then leave it to cool to finger
temperature (100 F). Mix with milk with the yogurt in a basin. Put in
a warm place for 4 to 5 hours to set as solid as yogurt.

If using vinegar or lemon juice, stir into the milk and bring it to a
near boil (200 F) in a bowl set in a saucepan of water. Remove and
keep in a warm place for 4 to 5 hours.

Pour the mixture into a sieve lined with a scalded clean cloth. After
an hour put a plate on top to weight and encourage the whey to drip
through. The curds in the cloth are the cheese. Cover and store in a
cool pantry, and it will keep for about a week. Drink the whey,
flavored with fruit juice, for your health - or use to to make
scones. Keep in refrigerator and eat within 2 days.

Yield:  1/2 lb Time: Overnight
