Title: DARK ROUX
Categories: May, Issue
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Vegetable shortening
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
Place rack in center of oven. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Melt
shortening in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat.
Gradually sift flour over shortening; whisk to combine. Mixture will
be thick and pasty. Combine to whisk until light brown, 10 to 12
minutes. Transfer skillet to oven; let roux cook until very dark

minutes if the pan is not cast iron). The roux can be kept,
refrigerated, for up to a week before using.
