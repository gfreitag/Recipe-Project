1    Egg

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cream the butter and shortening,
add the sugars and beat until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla,
mix well, then add remaining ingredients (if you're using a mixer,
stir in the last four ingredients with a spoon).  Drop by rounded
teaspoonfuls on an ungreased cookie sheet and bakd for about 10
minutes, or until golden brown. Cool slightly before removing from
cookie sheet.

Makes several dozen depending on how big your "drops" are and how
much of the dough you eat while you're dropping.
