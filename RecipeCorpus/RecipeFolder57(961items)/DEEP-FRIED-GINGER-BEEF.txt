1/4 c  Cornstarch

1 1/2 tb Flour
1 ts Pepper - freshly ground

1/4 c  Water
2 tb Soy sauce
1 1/2 tb Mushroom soy sauce

1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 tb Powdered chili

Cutting against the grain, slice flank steak into strips about 2
inches long by 1/4 inch wide. (slightly frozen meat makes this task
easier -- FHT). Combine batter ingredients and mix with steak slices;
toss to coat and set aside.

Cut up green and red peppers into same size strips and mix with
garlic and ginger.

Combine sauce ingredients and set aside.

To cook Ginger Fried Beef, put 10 cups of cooking oil into a deep
fryer or pot and preheat to 250 F.  Fry coated meat mixture, a few
pieces at a time, until crispy, about seven to ten minutes. Set meat
aside on paper towel to drain and keep oil at the same temperature
for second stage frying.

Put 3 Tbsp cooking oil in wok and heat.  Add green and red pepper
mixture and stir-fry over high heat 15 to 20 seconds. Add sauce
mixture and cook another 15 to 20 seconds until somewhat thickened.
Cooking times may be a little longer on a conventional stove.

Deep fry beef a second time for one minute.  Remove from oil and add
to stir fry; toss lightly to coat thoroughly and serve.
