Categories: Seafood, Appetizers
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/3 c  Yogurt
1/4 c  Coconut
1/4 c  Peanuts, chopped
2 tb Chutney
1 ts Curry powder
1/4 ts Ginger
4 1/2 oz Shrimp
MMMMM--------------------------BUNDLES-------------------------------
6    Phyllo dough sheets
1/2 c  Butter
In small mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, coconut, finely chopped
peanuts, chopped chutney, curry powder, and ginger. Gently stir in
shrimp.

Preheat oven to 375.  Unfold phyllo dough.  Place one sheet of phyllo
dough on a waxed-paper-lined cutting board. Cover remaining sheets
with a damp paper towel. Keep covered to prevent drying. Generously
brush with butter. Top with another sheet of phyllo, then brush with
more butter. Repeat with a third sheet of phyllo and butter. Using a
sharp knife, cut the stack of buttered phyllo sheets into twelve 4"
squares. Place about 2 t filling in the center of each square. For
each bundle, bring the 4 corners together; pinch and twist slightly.
Repeat with remaining phyllo dough and butter to make 24 bundles
total. Arrange bundles on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 18-20 minutes,
until golden.

To freeze: prepare phyllo bundles as directed, except do not bake.
Freeze unbaked bundles on baking sheet, then transfer to storage
container. Do not thaw before baking.
