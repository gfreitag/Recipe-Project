Categories: Stew, Chile, Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
24 ea Green chiles-roasted,peeled
2 lb Roast pork-cubed
1/4 c  Flour
2 tb Bacon drippings
2 lg Onions-fine chop
6 lg Tomatoes-chop
6 oz Tomatoe paste
2 c  Water
2 ea Garlic cloves-crush
2 ts Salt
Flour the pork and brown it in the drippings in a skillet.
:
Remove pork to a large stew pot, 3 to 5 quart size. Add onions to
drippings in the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.
Add the onions to the pork.  Cut the chiles into 1 inch
:
slices; add to the meat and onions in the pot.
Add the remaining ingredients and cook over medium heat for
:
about 1 hour, until the stew is slightly thickened.
If you prefer the all day method, follow the same directions
:
except put the ingredients in a crock pot. Cook on low for 10-12
hoursor high for 5 hours.
I like using fresh jalepenos. Depending on where the chiles
:
are from you can have a rather firey brew!!! Make sure you have
plenty of flour tortillas handy, you will not want to miss one tasty
drop.
