Title: CURRIED BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
4 tb Butter
2 c  Onions, yellow, chopped
4 ts Curry powder
2    Butternut squash
2    Apples
3 c  Chicken Stock
1 c  Apple juice
Salt & pepper
1    Granny Smith apple
Squash and apples complement each other naturally; curry adds an
exotic note. Feel free to experiment with other types of winter or
summer squash.

Melt the butter in a pot. Add chopped onions and curry powder and
cook, covered, over low heat until onions are tender, about 25
minutes.
Meanwhile peel the squash (about 3 lbs). A regular vegetable peeler
works best. Scrape out the seeds and chop the flesh.
When the onions are tender, pour in the stock, add squash and the 2
apples (peeled, cored and chopped). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
simmer, partially covered, until squash and apples are very tender,
about 25 minutes.
Pour the soup through a strainer, reserving liquid, and transfer the
solids to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, or
use a food mill fitted with a medium disk. Add 1 cup of the cooking
stock and process until smooth.
Return the purÂ‚ed soup to the pot and add apple juice and additional
cooking liquid, about 2 cups, until the soup is of desired
consistency.
Season to taste with salt and pepper, simmer briefly to blend and
heat through. Shred Granny Smith apple, unpeeled. Serve soup
immediately, garnished with shredded apple.
