Drain the can of salmon and flake the fish. Set aside.

Mix together the mayonnaise, yogurt, lime juice, curry paste, dill
cucumber, avocado and apple. Season lightly and stir in the salmon
flakes.

Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry each poppadom, not too rapidly
or they will lose their shape and curl up unevenly. Cook until they
are crisp and the edges have curled up. Pile equal amounts of the
salmon curry onto each poppadom and serve on individual plates,
garnished with a little salad and lime slices.

Serves 6. Approx. 240 kcals per serving
