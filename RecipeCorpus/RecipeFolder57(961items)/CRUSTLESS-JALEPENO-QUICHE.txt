Categories: Budget, Cheese/eggs, Non pc, Stone 9x13
Yield: 24 Servings
12    Eggs
1/3 c  Butter or margarine; melted
1 pt Cottage cheese
8 oz Shredded cheese (i use
-valveeta)
1/4 c  Onion; minced
1/2    Hormel bacon or ham bits
1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
MMMMM--------------------------TO TASTE-------------------------------
1    Seasoned salt
1    Fresh garlic
1    Cilantro
1    Jalapeno or other hot
-chilli; I use Trappeys in j
Preheat oven to 350F.  Heat margerine in a 9 x13" Baker. Mix all
ingredients together, except jalepenos. Pour into baker and add
jalepenos to the top of the mixture, place inch by inch, and cook for
20 min. Check by inserting knife 1/2 way between edge and center to
see if done. Cook more if it is'nt done. Garnish the top with a
Habenero pepper, cut with scissors starting at top and go down to
stem, keep moving around the pepper, spread out to make look like
flower, and place in the middle of the quiche.  I usually take this
to functions, since it is way to much food and way to fattening to
eat by myself. You will slice this in very small slices, usually by
the inch, this dish feeds a crowd. Source: My friend, Marggi Wallace
