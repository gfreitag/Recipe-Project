Title: DAL
Categories: Vegetables, East/orient
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Red or brown lentils,
-yellow or green split peas,
-or split, hulled mung beans
4 c  Water
2    Dried chiles, whole
1/4 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
1 c  Chopped onions
1 ts Fresh ginger root,grate/peel
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ts Garam masala (optional)
Wash lentils in several changes of cold water. In a medium pot, cover
with the water and add the whole dried chiles, turmeric, and salt.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often, until very
tender. This will take about 30 minutes for red lintels, 45 minutes
for peas, or an hour or more for mung beans. It may be necessary to
add more water to prevent sticking,but only 1/2 cup at a time,
because the final consistancy should be fairly thick. When the
lentils are almost cooked, heat the oil in a small pan, add the cumin
seeds, and cook for 10 or 15 seconds. Stir in the onions and ginger
and cook until the onions begin to brown, about 5 or 10 minutes.
When the lentils are tender, remove and discard the hot peppers.
Stir in the onion mixture, lemon juice, garam masala, and salt to
taste. Serve, passing additional garam masala to sprinkle on top, if
desired.
