Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
100 g  Spinach
- trimmed & washed well
175 g  Ricotta cheese

2    Eggs; lightly beaten
8    Crpes
100 g  Italian Fontina cheese

It's worth while making this dish for friends on a special occasion-
it takes a little time to prepare, but every mouthful justifies the
effort!

Cook the spinach in its own water for 2-3 minutes, until the leaves
are soft. Drain, squeeze dry and chop it. In a bowl combine it well
with the Ricotta, 2 tbs of the Parmesan, the eggs, and the nutmeg,
salt and pepper to taste.

Spread about 3 tbs of the mixture on each crpe, put a strip of the
Fontina across the centre, and roll up the crpes to enclose the
filling. Arrange them seam side down in one layer in a buttered
gratin dish. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the crpes and bake
in the middle of a preheated oven at 220 degrees C / 425 degrees F /
gas 7 for 15-20 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden.
