Sort and soak beans overnight; drain and discard soak water. In a
4-quart pot, saute onion in butter until tender but not browned. Add
soaked beans, 4 cups water, bouillon cube, ham (cut into chunks), bay

Remove 1 cup of beans from pot and mash with a potato masher or fork.
Add mashed beans back into pot and stir to thicken.  Remove ham
chunks and dice. Remove bay leaves and red pepper, if used and
discard. Add diced ham, green pepper and rum to beans. Cover and
simmer for 15 minutes.  Serve beans over rice and top with sour cream
if desired.
