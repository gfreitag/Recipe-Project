Title: CRUNCHY CORN BREAD DRESSING
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
15 oz Pkg. corn bread mix
8 oz Bacon, cut into 1/2" pieces
5    Celery stalks, diced
1    Green onion bunch, chopped
1 lg Onion, chopped
2 1/2 ts Poultry seasoning
3    Eggs, beaten to blend
1 c  Chicken stock or canned
Low-salt broth
Prepare corn bread according to package directions. Cool completely;
crumble (can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room
temperature). Preheat oven to 350F. Place corn bread on baking sheet.
Bake until slightly dry, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Transfer corn bread to large bowl.  Maintain oven temperature. Grease
13x9x2" glass baking dish.  Fry bacon pieces in heavy large skillet
over high heat until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes.  Using slotted
spoon, transfer bacon to bowl with corn bread.  Add diced celery and
all onions to same skillet. Saute vegetables over high heat until
just tender, about 12 minutes; add poultry seasoning and stir one
minute. Scrape contents of skillet into bowl with corn bread and toss
to blend. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Mix in eggs, then
chicken stock. Transfer to prepared dish. Cover dressing with
aluminum foil. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead; refrigerate). Bake
dressing covered 30 minutes; uncover and bake until golden and crisp
on top, about 30 minutes more. Optional: add about 2 dozen fresh
oysters (or two 8 oz. jars, drained) just before baking, cutting them
into pieces if they are very large.
