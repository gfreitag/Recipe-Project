Title: CURRIED FRUIT
Categories: Fruit, Holiday
Yield: 8 Servings
5 lb Fruit (pears, peaches,
-pineapple, apricot, etc.)
12    Cherries
3/4 c  Light brown sugar
3 ts Curry powder
1/3 c  Butter, melted
3/4 c  Almonds (blanched),
-slivered
Add sugar and curry powder to melted butter and mix well. Drain all
fruit well.  Arrange fruit and nuts in layers in casserole dish.
There should be enough fruit to fill the dish about three-quarters
full. Pour butter mixture over fruit.

Bake at 325 degrees F. for one hour.    Refrigerate overnight. Reheat
at 350 degrees F. until hot before serving (about 10-15 minutes).

NOTES:

*  Baked fruit with curry sauce and nuts -- This dish can be served
as a desert, alone, or on top of ice cream or pound cake (or both!).
But, our favorite way of serving it is as a side dish at brunch on
Christmas day. As long as I can remember, Mom has had this dish,
along with an egg/cheese casserole, bacon and muffins for Christmas
brunch. It is especially easy since you make it a day ahead of time.
Yield: Serves 8-12.

*  I use standard American "curry powder".  Any other that you want
to use should be ok.  Adjust the amount of curry powder to your
taste, or use cinnamon if you really don't like the flavor of curry.

Use your imagination in choosing the fruits to go in it. Cherries and
almonds are a must, but the rest is up to you. We use canned fruit,
but fresh would be good too.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, overnight cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
