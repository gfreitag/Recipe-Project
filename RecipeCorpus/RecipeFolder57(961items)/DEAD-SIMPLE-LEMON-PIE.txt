1 ea.12 oz. can of frozen lemonade, undiluted, 2 ea. 8 oz. cartons of
non-dairy frozen whipped toping and one can of sweetened condensed
milk, Borden is the cheapest in my area, and pour into a 9 oz.
KEEBLER graham cracker crust.

Thought you might like a recipe for a lemon pie.  It is dead simple
and rivals key lime pie for taste but has none of the egg yolks. Got
this out of my local Rural Electric monthly newletter.

If you chill this mix in a freezer it tastes an awful lot like ice
cream.
