Categories: Side dish, Mine
Yield: 2 Servings
1 lg Idaho potato
1 c  Vegetable oil
-for frying
1    Garlic clove(s)
-finely minced
2 ts Mild curry powder
1/4 ts Salt
Peel the potato if desired, it is not necessary. Slice it very thin
and put the slices in a colander. Rinse them with cold water and dry
them between paper towels.

Heat the vegetable oil in a 10-inch skillet to about 350F. It is hot
enough when a potato slice sizzle on contact.

Fry the chips in batches, 5-6 at a time, and keep them moving as they
cook to make sure they brown evenly and don't stick. When they turn
golden brown, use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the chips to
paper towels to drain.

When all the chips are fried, place them in a bowl. Place about 1 tbs
of the hot frying oil in a small bowl, add the garlic and let it sit
for 30 seconds. Add the curry powder and salt and stir well. Drizzle
this mixture over the chips and toss very gently to coat all the
chips. SErve warm or at room temperature.
