Title: DEATH BY CHOCOLATE CAKE (#7)
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
3 pk Ladyfingers
1/2 c  Dark rum
1 1/2 lb Butter  (no substitutes)
27 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
12    Eggs
2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
2 tb Vegetable oil
Paint outside of the ladyfingers with rum, and place flat side down,
around the sides and on the bottom of a 10 in. springform pan. Melt
butter in medium pan; remove from heat and add 24 oz. of the
chocolate bits. Stir until melted; cool slightly.  Beat the egg yokes
into the mixture one at a time until all are incorporated into the
chocolate. Beat the egg whites until they form stiff, not dry, peaks.
Fold the whites into the chocolate mixture, and pour into the lined
springform pan. Chill for at least 6 hours.

Whip the cream until thickened and add the sugar and vanilla. Continue
whipping until very stiff.  Turn the cake onto a serving platter,
removing the pan sides and bottom (the lady fingers will now be on
top). Spread a layer of whipped cream over the entire cake, then pipe
the rest of the whipped cream decoratively however you wish around
the cake - be imaginative! Melt the remaining chocolate chips with
the oil in a double boiler.  Cool completely.  Dribble the sauce down
the sides of the cake. Garnish with stemmed candied cherries. Store
in the refrigerator.

Should make about 16 servings, or 8 - depending....

Note: If the cake is going to be displayed for any length of time,
you may wish to use stabalized cream, and add 1 teaspoon of dissolved
gelatin to the cake mixture.

One more note: I don't know to whom the credit goes for this
"slightly" fattening recipe, and I apologize for that. But I am
passing it on to those of you who are in good health. If you are not
in good health, you use this recipe at your own risk - 12 eggs, 2-1/2
cups of cream, 27 oz. of chocolate, 1-1/2 lb. of butter (no
substitutes) - there ought to be a law! Thanks for listening.
