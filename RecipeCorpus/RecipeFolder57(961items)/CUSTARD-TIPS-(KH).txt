Stirred Custard: The standard test is to cook until mixture will
"coat the back of a metal spoon," not as easy to determine as it
sounds because uncooked custard will also leave a film on a spoon.
The difference is that cooked custard should leave a thick,
translucent, almost jellylike coat about the consistency of gravy. If
you suspect that custard is on the verge of curdling, plunge pan into
ice water to stop cooking.

Baked Custard: Insert a table knife into custard midway between rim
and center (not in the middle as cookbooks once instructed). If knife
comes out clean, custard is done. Remove at once from water bath and
cool. To chill quickly, set custard in ice water-but only if baking
dish is one that can take abrupt changes of temperature without
breaking.

What to Do About Curdled Custard: If it's baked custard, the best
idea is to turn it into a Trifle by mixing with small hunks of
cake=7F if stirred custard, strain out the lumps and serve as a sauce
over cake, fruit, or gelatin dessert.

Caution: Keep custards refrigerated; they spoil easily, often without
giving a clue.
