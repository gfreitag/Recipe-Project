Cherry Rum Sauce Glaceed Cherries

Soften yeast in warm milk. Beat in 1 cup of the sifted flour. Cover
and let rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Cream together
butter, sugar, and salt until smooth and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Stir in flavoring, then
remaining 2 cups of flour. Add yeast-raised sponge, blending well.
Pour into greased 9-inch spring-form tube pan or 9-inch angel food
cakepan. Let rise until triple in bulk. Bake in moderate (375-F) oven
for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from pan; cool on rack. Prick ring with
fork.

Place ring on large serving plate. Baste with warm Cherry Rum Sauce.
Just before serving, arrange Glazed Cherries over ring. Fill center
with scoops of vanilla ice cream, if desired. Makes 10 servings.

Cherry Rum Sauce: Drain 1 can (20 oz.) frozen cherries, defrosted.
Reserve cherries. To cherry juice add enough water to make 2 cups
liquid. Combine cherry liquid and 2 cups sugar in saucepan. Boil over
medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat cool to lukewarm,
and add 2 tablespoons rum or 1 1/2 teaspoons rum flavoring.

Glazed Cherries: To the reserved cherries, add 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup
corn syrup, and 2 or 3 drops red food coloring. Heat until sugar is
dissolved.
