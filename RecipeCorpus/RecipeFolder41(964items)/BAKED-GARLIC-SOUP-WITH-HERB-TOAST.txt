Title: BAKED GARLIC SOUP WITH HERB TOAST
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Head garlic
1 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1 tb Balsamic vinegar -- or
Brandy
1    Sprig fresh rosemary --
(3-inch)
SOUP:
3 c  Vegetable broth
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Salt and pepper -- to taste
HERB TOAST:
1/2    Loaf bread -- see note
1    Clove garlic -- cut once
Lengthwise
Extra virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 tb Garlic chives -- minced
Preheat the oven to 300F. Slice the top from the head of garlic and
remove most of the papery outer skin from the head, but do not peel
or separate into cloves. Place in a small ovenproof dish. Pour the
olive oil over the top and add the vinegar and rosemary. \Cover with
aluminum foil and bake until very tender, about 1 hour. Remove from
the oven and let cool. NOTE - Prepare 1/2 loaf of whole wheat Italian
bread: cut diagonally into 1/2 inch-thick slices. Preheat the oven to
350F. Squeeze the softened garlic from the skins into a saucepan, and
add the broth and wine. Heat to a simmer over medium-low heat and
cook for 15 minutes. While cooking, make the herb toast. Bake the
bread slices on a baking sheet until crisp but not golden, 6 to 8
minutes. Rub the bread with the cut sides of the garlic clove, then
brush generously with oil. Sprinkle on a thin layer of the Parmesan
cheese and chives. Bake until the cheese is melted, another 5
minutes. Serve immediately with the hot soup.

Substitution for the Chinese garlic chives: 1 clove garlic and twice
as much volumn of fresh chives.

NOTES : Two stage process. First, roast/bake the garlic. Second, use
roasted garlic to flavor a broth. Serve with herb toast. Make extra!
Garlic paste can be added to mashed potatoes, served with meats or
vegetables, or simply spread on slices of toasted Italian bread.
