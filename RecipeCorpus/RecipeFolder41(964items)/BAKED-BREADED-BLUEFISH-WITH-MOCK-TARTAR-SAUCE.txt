Preheat the oven to 350F.  Combine the skim milk, egg white and
pepper to make a seasoned egg wash.

Dip the fillets into the egg wash, then dredge them in the bread
crumbs. [Let sit for 10 minutes.]

Lay the fillets on a nonstick baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.

NOTE:  For me this dish is a marvelous replacement for fried fish.

Sauce:  Combine all ingredients and refrigerate in a tightly covered
container.

NOTES:  This sauce will keep for a week if stored as suggested. Use
this as you would regular tartar sauce with any dish. Try it as a
replacement for mayonnaise on sandwiches and in salads.
