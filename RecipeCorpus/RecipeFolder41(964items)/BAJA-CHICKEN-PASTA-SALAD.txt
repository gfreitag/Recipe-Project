~----------------- Heat enough salted water to cover the chicken
breast (1/4 tsp salt to 1 cup of water) to boiling in a 4 quart Dutch
oven. Add the chicken breast.
Cover and heat to boiling, reduce the heat and simmer until the
chicken is done, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the chicken with a
slotted spoon.
Heat the water to boiling and add the fruit and ring macaroni or orzo

stirring occasionally, just until the ring macaroni is tender, about
6 to 8 minutes or 10 minutes for the orzo, then drain.  Rinse with
cold water and drain again.  Cut the chicken into 1/2-inch pieces and
mix with the fruit, macaroni, jicama and onions. Mix the remaining
ingredients and toss with the chicken mixture.  Cover and refrigerate
until chilled, at least 2 hours.
