This spread pleases the palates of East and West alike with its
slightly sm okey taste and rich creamy texture. It is considered best
when heavily lade n with the freshest garlic, and is excellent as a
meza or cocktail dip with potato chips, toast rounds, or Arabic bread.

Cut stem and green hull from top of eggplant. Bake it whole or broil
over a n open flame until the flesh is soft and the skin becomes
crisp and starts to crack open. Scoop pulp out of the skin. Mash
thoroughly or pass through a food mill. Slowly beat in lemon juice
alternately with taheeni. Crush gar lic with salt and mix to a paste
with a little lemon juice. Blend this into the eggplant mixture.
Adjust seasoning to taste adding more salt or le mon juice. Pour onto
shallow serving dishes or platters. Garnish with chopp ed parsley or
leaves. Arrange pomegranate seeds in rows across top.

Serve cold with olive oil, radishes and green onions.

Baba ghannouj can be prepared in small quantities in the electric
blender. Beat the grilled pulp first, then alternately add taheeni
and lemon juice, and garlic crushed with salt. Prepare a third of the
quantity given above so as not to overfill the blender.
