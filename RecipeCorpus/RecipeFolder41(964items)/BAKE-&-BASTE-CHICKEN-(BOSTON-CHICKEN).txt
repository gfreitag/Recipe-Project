1 tb Lime juice
1/4 ts Paprika
4    Chicken breast halves,
-washed and patted dry
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, combine canola oil,
honey, lime juice and paprika. Place chicken, skin side up, in a
7x11
inch baking dish. Apply mixture to chicken pieces in a single layer.
Bake in over for 35-40 minutes, basting every 8-10 minutes or until
well browned and juices run clear when you cut into the thickest
part
of chicken. Remove from oven. Cover with foil for 15 minutes. This
softens chicken and keeps it hot until served. Serves 4. From: Pat
