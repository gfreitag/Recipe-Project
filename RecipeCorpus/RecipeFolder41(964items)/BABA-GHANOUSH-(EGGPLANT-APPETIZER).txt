Title: BABA GHANOUSH (EGGPLANT APPETIZER)
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 2 Cups
2 ea Eggplants, about 1 1/2 lbs.
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/4 c  Tahini (sesame seed paste)
2 ea Cloves garlic, crushed
Salt to taste
Olive oil
Freshly chopped parsley,
Paprika or pomegranate
Seeds to garnish
1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Cover baking sheet with foil. Wipe
eggplant and pierce with point of sharp knife. Place on prepared
baking sheet and bake in preheated oven 35 to 45 minutes. When cool
enough to handle, peel eggplants and remove seeds.  Place in
container of food processor and sprinkle with lemon juice to keep
from browning.

2.  Add tahini, garlic, and salt.  Process until smooth.

3.  Spread onto serving platter and pour small amount of olive oil
over top.  Garnish with chopped parsley, paprika, or pomegranate
seeds. Serve with warmed pita bread and crudites. Cover and store in
refrigerator.

Notes:  Baba ghanoush is a traditional dish of Lebanon and Syria, and
is often served with raw or blanced vegetables. The combined flavors
of eggplant, garlic, and lemon juice are very Mediteranean. For a
smokey flavor, grill eggplant over hot charcoal instead of baking in
the oven.

Variation:  In Greece, olive oil is used instead of tahini. In Syria
yogurt is added for a lighter tasting dish. In Turkey it is called
Hunkar Begendi, tahini and garlic are omitted and 1 cup white sauce
and 1/3 cup grated cheese are mixed into the eggplant and heated
before serving.
