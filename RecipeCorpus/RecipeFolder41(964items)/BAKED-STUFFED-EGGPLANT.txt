1/4 lb Mozzarella cheese; diced

Recipe by: Janet Morrissey <janetm@MAGNUS1.COM> Preheat oven to 350F.

With a tablespoon, scoop out some of the pulp from the eggplant
halves, making sure not to break the skin. Place the eggplant halves
on a large platter and sprinkle generously with slat. Let stand about
20 minutes to allow the salt to draw out the eggplant's bitter
juices. Pat the eggplant dry with paper towels.

Dice the pulp of the eggplant and put it in a bowl with the tomatoes,
mozzarella, basil, parsley, garlic, and olive oil. Season with salt
and pepper flakes. Fill the eggplant's cavities with this mixture.

Oil a baking dish lightly, and put the eggplant halves into the dish.
Bake until they are lightly golden, soft to the touvh, and easily
pierced with the tip of a thin knife, 15 to 25 minutes, depending on
the size of the eggplants.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

NOTES:

This is from Biba Caggiano's _Trattoria Cooking_ cookbook. It is easy
to do and can be doubled and frozen for an additional meal later on.

One of Biba's notes is that she will dice any leftover eggplant and
toss it quickly in a skillet with extra virgin olive oil and freshly
diced tomatoes and serve it over penne, shells, or rigatoni.
