1 c  Water
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 tb Butter
1 c  Shredded Mozzarella
1 tb Sundried tomatoes; crumbled
2 tb Dehydrated onion
1 ts Minced basil
2 c  Bread flour
1 tb Dry milk
2 ts Dry yeast
I've been playing around with these ingredients and my husband thinks
I should "go public" with this recipe! It's for a bread machine, but
you could make it by hand in the conventional way, too. In my
Zojirushi machine the crust is rather dark (but still delicious) so
other machines may need a light crust setting. Enjoy! Place ingred.
in B/M in order given (start at bottom for>>>> Welbilt/Dak) set crust
to light and bake on white bread setting. I'm munching on the "heel"
as I type and am thinking about how good a sandwich will be in a few
hours! Maybe next time I'll add pepperoni and have all the sandwich
ingredients in each slice. It has a real pizza taste! LINDA IN
