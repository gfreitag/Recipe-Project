Categories: Casseroles, Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
12 oz Uncooked Medium Egg Noodles
1 tb Vegetable oil
8 oz Boneless chicken breasts
-- (without skin),
-- cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 sm Red onion, diced
3 ts Curry powder
-(or more, if desired)
1 1/2 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
10 oz Evaporated skim milk
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
1 c  Frozen peas
1 1/2 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms

Prepare pasta according to package directions. While pasta is
cooking, heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large
heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and onion and
stir until the chicken begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the
curry powder and continue stirring 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken
broth and reduce heat to low. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and
evaporated skim milk together until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir
the cornstarch into the skillet, heat to simmering and simmer 2
minutes.

Pour the contents of the skillet into a large bowl. When the pasta is
done, drain well. Add the cooked pasta, peas, mushrooms, lemon juice
and salt and pepper to the curry sauce. Toss well. Pour the mixture
into an 11 x 9-inch baking dish and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top.
Bake until the edges are bubbling and the crumbs are golden brown,
about 15 minutes. Serve hot.
