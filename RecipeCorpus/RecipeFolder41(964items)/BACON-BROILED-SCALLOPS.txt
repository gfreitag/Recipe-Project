24 lg Sea scallops, 1 1/4 lbs

Rinse scallops with running cold water to remove sand from crevices.
Pat dry. Preheat broiler. Cut each bacon slice crosswise in half,
wrap each half around a scallop. Secure with toothpick. Sprinkle
lightly with salt and seasoned pepper. Broil 8-10 mins, turning
frequently so bacon will brown evenly, until scallops turn opaque
through. Remove toothpicks. Arrange on platter, garnish with lemon
wedges. 205 cals per serving. Good source of iron S: GH Ckbk
