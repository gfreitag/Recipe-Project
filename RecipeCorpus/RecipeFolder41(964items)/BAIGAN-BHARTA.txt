2 tb Veg oil
2    To 3 serrano chiles, seeded

Someone on r.f.v.c requested a recipe for Baigan Bharta yesterday;
here is one from Yamuna Devi's "The Best of Lord Krishna's Cuisine",
slightly tweaked, that I make a lot. (also posted on r.f.v.c.)

Bake the eggplant 40 minutes at 425F on a baking sheet. Split it and
scoop out the pulp; discard the skin. (Some people roast the eggplant
over charcoal for a nice flavor).

Heat the ghee on medium; add cumin seeds, serranos, and asafetida.
Cook until the cumin seeds darken.  Add the eggplant, salt, and
corriander; cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occassionally. When
it thickens, remove from the heat, add the yogurt, cilantro, and
garam masala, and serve. (The yogurt might curdle; to prevent that,
let the eggplant cool first, then add the yogurt etc, then briefly
reheat.)
