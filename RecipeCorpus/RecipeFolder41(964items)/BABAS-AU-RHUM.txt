Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter
1 pk Yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
2    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1/4 ts Grated lemon rind
2 tb Dried currants
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
2 oz Dark rum
Rum syrup; hot
Recipe by: Craig Claibourne - The New York Times Cook Book 1. Scald
the milk, add the butter and blend. Cool to lukewarm. 2. Sprinkle the
yeast on the luke warm water and stir until
disolved. 3. Beat the egg yolks and gradually add the sugar.
Vigorously
beat in the whole egg.  Add the milk to the mixture, disolved
yeast, lemon rind and currants. 4. Stir in the flour and beat
until smooth.  Cover the batter and
let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about one hour.
Stir down. 5. Spoon into six individual well-greased baba molds or
small
custard cups, filling them two-thirds full.  Let rise, uncovered,
until the batter reaches the tops of the molds, about thirty
minutes.  Fifteen minutes before the babas are ready,
preheat the oven to moderate (350F). 6. Bake until a cake tester
comes out clean, about twenty
minutes.  Remove from the molds and cool on a cake rack.
If desired, wrap in foil and freeze. 7. Marinate the babas in hot
rum sauce several hours before
serving.  To serve, ignite two ounces heated dark rum in a
ladle and pour over the babas.
