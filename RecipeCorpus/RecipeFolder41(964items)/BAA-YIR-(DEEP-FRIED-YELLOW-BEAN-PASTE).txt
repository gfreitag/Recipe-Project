Soak the moong beans in water for 30 minutes; drain. Roll the kaffir
leaves into thin cigarettes; slice into slivers. In a mortar pound the
drained moong beans to form a paste. Add the other ingredients in
turn, stirring well.  Pluck a small piece of the paste and form into
a ball the size of a walnut.  Do not mould too tightly. Deep-fry the
balls until golden brown, drain and serve with the thick sweet sauce

THE SAUCE: Gently heat the three ingredients until the sugar
dissolves. Allow to cool before serving.
