Combine water, 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar and yeast. Stir to
dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Add butter and remaining 3
tablespoons brown sugar to work bowl. Process until mixed, 10 - 15
seconds. Stop processor once or twice, if necessary, to scrape sides
of bowl.

Add eggs and salt to butter mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.  Stop processor and scrape sides of bowl, if necessary.

Add 1 1/4 cups of the flour and yeast mixture to butter mixture.
Process on/off 8 to 10 times until blended.

Turn on processor and add enough of the remaining flour through feed
tube so dough forms a ball that cleans the sides of the bowl. Process
until ball turns around bowl about 25 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Knead raisins into dough.
Shape dough into a ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning to
grease all sides. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in
warm place until almost doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Roll out dough into a 16
inch square.  Combine sugar and 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon and
sprinkle over dough. Roll up dough jelly-roll fashion. Pinch seam to
seal. Cut into 8 equal slices.  Place slices cut side down in greased
tube or Bundt pan. Let stand in warm place until almost doubled,
about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until done, 30 - 35 minutes.

Remove bread immediately from pan and invert onto wire rack. Combine
powdered sugar and remaining 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Sprinkle mixture
over bread. Cool.
