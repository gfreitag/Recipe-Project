MMMMM-------------------COOKING ACROSS AMERICA------------------------
6    Sheets phyllo dough, 14"x18"
-thawed if frozen
1/2 c  Unsalted butter; melted, to
-brush with
4 sl Ham, (thin), about 7"x4"
2 sl Cheddar, (thin), about 7"x4"
2 sl Swiss, (thin), about 7"x4"
Preheat the oven to 375~.  Keep the phyllo wrapped until the ham and
cheeses have been cut to size. Place 1 phyllo sheet on a damp towel
with the short edge of the dough nearest you. Brush sparingly with
butter; continue layering 2 more sheets in this manner. Set aside and
proceed with the next 3 sheets in the same way.

Fold the phyllo in half.  Place a slice of ham on the phyllo, leaving
at least 1.1/2" margin of dough uncovered at each side. Place a slice
of Cheddar cheese over the ham. Repeat with another piece of ham, and
top with Swiss cheese.  Fold the margins in and brush with butter.
Lift one end of the phyllo and carefully roll it, jelly-roll fashion,
starting with the short end.

Place the roll, seam side down, on a lightly buttered cookie sheet and
brush with butter.  Repeat with the remaining phyllo, ham, and
cheeses. Bake for 20 to 25 mins., until golden. Serve immediately.
