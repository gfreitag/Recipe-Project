Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Recipe
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar
6    Eggs
1 c  Raisins
1 c  Currants
1 c  Pecans
Flour
2 c  Breadcrumbs
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Allspice
MMMMM-------------------------HARD SAUCE------------------------------
1 c  Powdered sugar
2    To 5 Tbls butter
1/8 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla or
1 tb Coffee, rum, whisky,
-brandy, or lemon juice
1    Egg or
1/4 c  Cream
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Beat butter until soft.  Gradually add the sugar and blend until
creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time.
In a bowl, combine raisins, currants, and pecans and sprinkle
lightly with flour. Add these ingredients to the butter mixture.
Combine breadcrumbs, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice; stir these
ingredients into the butter mixture.  Bake in a greased tube pan or
baking dish for about 1/2 hour. Serve with about 1 cup Hard Sauce.

Hard Sauce:

The basic ingredients of hard sauce are always the same, although
proportions and flavoring may vary.  In this recipe, the larger
amount of butter is preferable. An attractive way to serve hard sauce
on cold cake or pudding is to chill it and mold it with a small fancy
cutter--or put it through and individual butter mold.

Sift the powdered sugar.
Beat butter until soft; add sugar gradually.  Beat well until
ingredients are well blended.
Add the salt and flavoring.  Beat in the egg or cream. Continue to
beat until sauce is very smooth. Chill thoroughly. Submitted By
