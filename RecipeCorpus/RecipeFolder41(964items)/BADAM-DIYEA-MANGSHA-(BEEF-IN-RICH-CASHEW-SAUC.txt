1. Heat 2tb oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the potatoes until
they turn medium brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon
and set aside. (Omit this step for a lower-fat dish.)

2. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pan and heat over medium low heat.
Fry bay leaf, red chili, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves for a few
seconds. Add onion and fry until richly browned but not burnt, 18 to
20 minutes, stirring constantly.

3. Stir in ginger, garlic, green chili, turmeric, cumin, and sugar.
Add meat and water. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, 30 minutes.
Add the potatoes and simmer, covered, until both meat and potatoes
are tender, about 30 more minutes. Turn heat very low. Blend in
yogurt, nuts, and salt and remove from heat. (Prolonged heating will
curdle the sauce, detracting from its appearance and texture.) Stir
in garam masala. Decorate with onion rings and cilantro.
