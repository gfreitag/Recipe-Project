Categories: Side dish, African, Ivory coast, Fruits, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lg Very ripe plantains
2 ts Chillie sambal, fresh
1 c  Rice flour
60 ml Corn oil
2 ts Turmeric powder
Salt to taste
Peel the plantains, cut them into small chunks & put into a large deep
mixing bowel. Mash into a thick paste with your fingers or an electric
clender. If using a blender, you may need to add 30-60 ml of water for
smoother blending. Add the chilli sambal, rice flour, salt and mix
well. Gently heat the corn oil in a frying pan and add the turmeric.
Stir well, remove from the heat and blend into the plantain mixture
which should be thinck yet soft enough to pour. If it is too soft,
add small amounts of rice flour or if too stiff, add small amounts of
water until it reached th described consistency.

Grease a loaf tin, and pour plantain mixture into it. Bake in teh
overn on medium to low heat at 150-180C for 1 hr. or until cooked and
firm. When cooked, remove from the overn and allow to stand for
approximately 5-10 mins before turning it out on a wire rack. Slice
and serve with salted peanuts or as an accompaniment to spicy dishes.
