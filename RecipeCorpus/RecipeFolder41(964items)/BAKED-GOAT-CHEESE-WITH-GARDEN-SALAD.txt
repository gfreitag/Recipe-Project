to 1 day. Mix bread crumbs and dried thyme. Set aside. Make dressing
with 1/2 cup olive oil, vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Set

slices. Brush each slice with some of melted butter. Place on baking
sheet and bake at 350F 5 to 7 min utes, or until croutons are lightly
browned. While still warm rub each crouton with cut clove of garlic.
Dip marinated cheese slices in bread crumbs. Place in lightly oiled
baking dish. Bake at 400F 6 minutes, or until cheese is barely
bubbling and is golden brown. Toss lettuces with enough dressing to
lightly coat. Arrange on 4 salad plates. Place cheese in center of
plates, browned side up. Arrange croutons around cheese.
