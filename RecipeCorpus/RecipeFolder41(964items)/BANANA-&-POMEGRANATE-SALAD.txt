Title: BANANA & POMEGRANATE SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 Servings

1 tb Palm Sugar
2    Pomegranates
3    Bananas
Juice of 2 limes
Lime Dressing
This is a side-dish from the north of India. It makes a refreshing and
pretty contrast to a highly spiced dish and couldn't be simpler. Try
it next time you are having a curry meal, or use it as one of several
salads for entertaining.

Mix together the juice of 2 limes and a tablespoon of palm sugar (or
substitute brown sugar). Taste and adjust for sweet- sour balance if
necessary. Cut 2 pomegranates which have been chilling in the fridge
into quarters and twist each wedge to help free the seeds. Coax them
out and mound them in the centre of a serving dish. Slice 3 bananas
and arrange them around the peri- meter of the pomegranate seeds.
Sprinkle with the lime dressing and serve.
