Title: BAKED ONIONS WITH SOUR CREAM - PLHOL
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Bermuda or Vidalia onions,
-3" dia
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) butter,
-at room temperature
1/4 c  Sour cream, room temperature
1 tb Brown sugar
1 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Finely minced fresh parsley
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Preheat oven to 375 degrees (F).  Place the unpeeled onions in a
foil-lined shallow pan.  Bake, uncovered, for 1-1/2 hours. Warm a
heatproof shallow serving dish. When onions are tender, remove from
oven. Spear each with a fork, snip or cut off both ends, and remove
skin. Place the peeled onions in the warmed dish. Immediately add the
butter and sour cream so they will melt from the heat of the onions.
Then add the rest of the ingredients and toss lightly to mix. [Note:
these will hold nicely in a warm oven for 1/2 -
1    hour.]

If you can't make this with real butter and sour cream, it really
isn't worth making.  When you do, this is absolute heaven!
