Title: BAKED FRANKFURTERS & RICE (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
2 1/4 c  Rice -- uncooked
1 ts Salt
1 qt Boiling water
2 1/4 lb Frankfurters -- cut in1/2"
Slices
58 oz Canned tomatoes -- 2 (29-oz)
Cans
1/4 c  Sweet pepper flakes
1/2 c  Instant minced onion
1 lb Processed cheddar cheese --
Shredded
2 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate).

Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow
enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings
or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served
without freezing.

Place rice in a large baking pan.  Add salt and water. Stir. Cover
and bake 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes.
Combine cooked rice with remaining ingredients. Pour one-fourth of
the mixture into each 8x8-inch baking pan.  Pack food tightly to
avoid air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Bake 45
minutes or until pepper flakes and onion are tender.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove freezer
wrap. Place food in baking pan.  Bake 1 1/4 hours or until center is
hot.
