Categories: Fish, Portuguese
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Salt cod; soaked
2 lg Onion; sliced
6 tb Butter
1    Garlic clove; minced
3 lg Potato
2 tb Bread crumbs
10    Green olive, pitted
10    Olive, black
4    Egg; hard-cooked
1/2 c  Parsley, fresh; chopped
Wine vinegar
Olive oil
Pepper, black
Soak the dried cod in cold water for about 24 hours, or until
completely moistened.  Change the water several times; drain
thoroughly.

Put the cod into a saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes or until fish is tender.
Drain; skin and bone the fish. Flake with a fork into large pieces.

Saute the onions in half the butter until they are tender and golden.
Add the barlic.  Boil the unpeeled potatoes in salted water. Once
tender, remove from the heat, refresh in running cold water; then
remove skins. Drain and slice into 1/4" pieces.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease a 1-1/2 quart casserole with the
remaining butter.  Arrange a layer of half the potatoes, then half
the cod, then half the onions. Sprinkle with a little pepper, and
repeat layering. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top layer.  Bake for
15 minutes, or until heated through and lightly browned. Before
serving, garnish with olives and eggs, and sprinkle with parsley.
Serve with wine vinegar and oil in cruets and pepper on the side.
