Fry bacon until crisp.  Chop bacon and reserve drippings. Cook onions

3 minutes. Add flour, stirring to prevent lumps. Cook 3 - 5 minutes
until mix just begins to run golden.  Add chicken stock gradually,
whisking to prevent lumps, until liquid thickens. Reduce heat to
simmer and add potatoes, cream, chopped bacon, parsley, garlic,
basil, salt, pepper sauce and black pepper.  Simmer 10 minutes; DO
NOT ALLOW TO BOIL. Add grated cheese and green onions.

Heat until cheese melts smoothly. Garnish each serving as desired with
chopped bacon, grated cheese and chopped parsley.
