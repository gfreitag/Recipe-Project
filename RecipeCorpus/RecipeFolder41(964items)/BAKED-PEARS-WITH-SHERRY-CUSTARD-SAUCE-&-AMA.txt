Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a small saucepan, combine the
raisins and wine and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let
stand 15 minutes to allow the raisins to plump. Strain the raisins
and drain well, reserving any liquid. Place the pears in a baking
dish just large enough to hold them. Combine the raisins with the
pine nuts and fill the cavities of the pears. Put the butter, brown
sugar, white wine, lemon zest and the reserved raisin liquid in the
saucepan and simmer to melt the sugar, approximately 2 minutes.
Drizzle over the pears. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the pears
are tender when pierced with a toothpick, basting occasionally with
the juices. Serve the warm pears in shallow wide-rimmed bowls. Spoon
the Sherry Custard Sauce around and sprinkle with crushed Amaretti
Cookies. Garnish with the mint sprigs, if desired.

Yield: 8 servings
