Here is a recipe from Lora Brody's "The Kitchen Survival Guide."

Heat oven to 375'F. with rack in center position. Spray a 2-quart
casserole with non-stick vegetable cooking spray or coat it lightly
with vegetable shortening. Pour rice over botton of prepared dish,
then pour in broth. Rinse chicken and pat it dry with paper towels.
Layer the chicken over the rice.

Combine remaining ingredients, mix well, and spread over the chicken.
Cover loosely with foil and bake 40-50 minutes. Remove the foil and
continue baking 10 minutes, or until chicken is done. Makes 6
servings.

NOTE: Test chicken for doneness by pricking with fork; juices should
run clear. Or slice into thickest part with a small sharp knife to
make sure there is no pinkness in the meat. If liquid is not
absorbed, let sit 5-10 before serving.
