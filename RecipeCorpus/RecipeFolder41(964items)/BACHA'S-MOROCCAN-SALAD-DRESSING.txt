Yield: 1 Recipe
2 tb Lemon juice*

4 sm Garlic cloves, chopped
1/2 ts Sweet red pepper**
1/8 ts Hot red pepper***
Salt & black pepper
4 tb Italian parsley, chopped
4 tb Cilantro, chopped
Mix together all the ingredients & let sit for a while to allow the
flavours to marry.  Then use. * Or replace with wine vinegar ** I use
Hungarian paprika, it's sweeter than Spanish *** I use cayenne. You
need the hot to contrast with the sweet.
