In a bowl, sift together paprika, mustard, garlic powder, cayenne,
black pepper and ginger.  In another bowl combine the honey, red wine
vinegar, and Worchestershire sauce. Slowly stir the liquid
ingredients into the dry ingredients, adding as much beer as needed
to form a thick smooth paste. Rub the spice mixture across all
surfaces of the ribs. Place the ribs arch side up in a roasting pan
without overlapping. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator about 1
hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the roasting pan on the
lower rack of the oven, cooking ribs until tender, about 2 1/2 to 3
hours. Test doneness by inserting skewer into the meat; it should
meet with little or no resistance. Remove ribs form oven and allow to
rest 15 minutes before serving. Optional grill finish: Place the ribs
on a preheated grill, arch side down, cooking until slightly charred,
5 to 10 minutes.  Turn over fot 2 to 3 minutes and serve.
