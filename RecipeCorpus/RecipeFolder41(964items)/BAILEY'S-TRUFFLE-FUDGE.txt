2 tb Butter; cut in pieces
4 tb Bailey's Irish Creme
*Bailey's Original Irish Creme gets its flavor from a blend of Irish
whiskey and fresh cream, which is delivered daily to the Dublin plant
that makes the liqueur. This dessert is packed with chocolate and
rich flavor. Using all semisweet chocolate will yield a deeper,
darker fudge.

FUDGE: Melt all chips with butter until they are soft enough to stir
smooth. Do not overheat. Add chocolate/butter mixture to powdered
sugar and Baileys. Stir until smooth. Add nuts, if desired. Mix well.

Place fudge in an 8-inch square pay sprayed with vegetable spray. Lay
a sheet of plastic wrap on top and gently press to smooth fudge.

TOPPING: Melt chips until smooth. Remove from heat. With a fork, beat
in butter and Bailey's until smooth.

Spread topping over fudge with a knife. If a very smooth top is
desired, use a piece of plastic as done on fudge.

Refrigerate until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Can be frozen. Makes 64 pieces.
