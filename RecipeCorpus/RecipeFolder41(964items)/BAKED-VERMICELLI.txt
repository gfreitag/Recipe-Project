Title: BAKED VERMICELLI
Categories: Cheese, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Vermicelli -- cooked and
Drained
4 tb Butter
4 tb Flour
1/4 c  Onion -- finely diced
16 oz Evoporated Skim Milk -- (3
sm Cans)
4 oz Colbyjack Cheese -- grated
4 oz Parmesan Cheese -- grated
1/4 ts Black Pepper, Freshly
Ground
3 ds Tabasco Sauce
1 ds White Pepper
1 ds Cayenne Pepper
1 ds Ground Nutmeg
2    Eggs -- beaten
1/3 c  To 1/2 C Breadcrumbs
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cook vermicelli according to package directions. Drain and place into
a baking dish that has been buttered, oiled or sprayed with cooking
spray.

Melt butter in a sauce pan, and add onions and saute until
transparent. Add flour to make a roux and cook for about 3 or 4
minutes. Add the milk and stir until hot. Remove about a cup of the
milk and set aside. Add the cheeses to the saucepan and continue
stirring untill the cheese has melted. Add the spices. Gradually add
the eggs to the cooled reserved milk and beat until the eggs are
incorporated. Stirring continuously, add the eggs to the saucepan a
little at a time. Continue stirring and cook until the sauce begins
to thicken. Pour the cheese sauce over the vermicelli and sprinkle
withe the breadcrumbs. Bake for 30 minutes or until brown on top.

For a really neat looking dish, do a crust of breadcrumbs by layering
the bottom and sides of the baking dish with beaten egg followed by a
layer of breadcrumbs. Repeat several times. Then bake and unmold onto
a serving plate.
