Title: BAKED STUFFED SQUID
Categories: Greek, Seafood
Yield: 5 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1 lb Squid
Salt
6 tb Olive oil
1    Onion; chopped
1/3 c  Raw long-grain white rice
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint leaves
2 tb White wine
1/4 c  Pine nuts
1/4 c  Black raisins
Freshly ground pepper
4    Peeled tomatoes; drained
1/3 c  White wine
Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and
small sand bag and ink. Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them
inside and out with cold water.  Heads and tentacles should be rinsed
thoroughly and cooked along with the sacs after you stuff the latter.
Drain and set aside.

Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy frying pan, then add the onion and
cook, without browning, until transparent. Stir in the rice and saute
a few minutes, until golden.  Blend in the parsley, mint, 2
tablespoons wine, pine nuts, and raisins, and season with salt and
pepper to taste. Add enough water to half cover and cook for a few
minutes, then stuff the squid sacs with the mixture using a very
small spoon and allowing enough liquid in each for the rice to cook.
Seal opening with skewers or toothpicks. Place the stuffed sacs with
the heads and tentacles in a baking-serving dish.  Sprinkle with salt
and pepper and set aside.

Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, 1/3 cup wine, and a little salt and
pepper in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour the sauce
over the squid and dribble the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over
the top. Bake in a medium-slow oven (300 F) for 1 1/2 hours or until
the squid and rice are tender and the sauce has thickened. Serve warm
or cold.
