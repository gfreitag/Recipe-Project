Categories: Rice, Korean
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Rice
6    Chestnuts
3 1/2 c  ;water
Korean chestnuts are the size of a small egg -- very large, solid and
sweet. It is astonishing in the autumn, the chestnut season, to see a
large heap of these giant chestnuts piled in pyramids in the public
marketplaces. In New York, during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season,
reasonably good chestnuts imported from Italy are available and make
a satisfactory substitute.

Prepare the chestnuts in this manner: Chestnuts that have been well
dried by leaving them at room temperature for a day or two are easier
to peel with a serrated knife. Sometimes the peel can be broken off
with your fingers. To remove the inner and outer skin, cut off about
half of the thick outer shell and drop the chestnuts in boiling
water. Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Drain, cool enough to
handle, then pull off both skins.

1. Rinse the rice in cold water and drain.

2. Peel the chestnuts of their outer brown skins and the inner,
thinner skin linings. Cut them into halves, if large, or leave them
whole if they are small.

3. Combine the rice, chestnuts and water, bring to a boil, then
reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes. Stir once or twice
toward the end of the cooking. The water will have been absorbed and
the chestnuts softened.

Serve warm. Serves 6 at Korean meals.
