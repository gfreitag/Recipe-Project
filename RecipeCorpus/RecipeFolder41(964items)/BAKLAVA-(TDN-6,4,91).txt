Title: BAKLAVA (TDN-6/4/91)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Honey
2 c  Walnuts, finely chopped
3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Allspice
1 1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1 lb Phyllo dough
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

In saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water; bring to a boil,
stirring until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook over medium heat for
about 20 minutes (until thickness of honey). Stir in honey, continue
to cook about 10 minutes longer.  Remove from heat and set aside to
cool.

In bowl, combine walnuts, 3/4 cup sugar, and spices, set aside. Melt
butter, set aside.

Remove phyllo dough from package, cover unused portion with damp towel
while working with it.  Using kitchen scissors, cut to fit a 9x13
inch pan. Coat pan with melted butter. Place 10 phyllo sheets in pan,
two sheets at a time, brushing each top sheet with melted butter.
Place trimmings between full sheets.  Spread with 1/3 of nut mixture,
4-5 sheets of buttered phyllo then the remaining nut mixture. Top
with remaining phyllo, buttering every other sheet.

With a small, very sharp knife cut pastry lengthwise into 6 strips.
Then cut diagonally to make small diamonds. Heat remaining butter
(there should be 1/2 cup) until frothy and pour it over pastry,
letting it run down into cuts.

Bake in slow oven for 1 hour.  Remove from oven.  Turn oven to 400
degrees. Pour about half of syrup mixture over pastry. Return to oven
for 2-3 minutes until browned on top. Pour remaining syrup over
pastry. Let stand at least 3 hours before serving.
