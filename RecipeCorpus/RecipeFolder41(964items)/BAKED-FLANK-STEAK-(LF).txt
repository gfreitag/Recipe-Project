Title: BAKED FLANK STEAK (LF)
Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Flank steak
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Hot water
Bay leaf
1 lg Garlic clove -- crushed
1 ts Salt

Trim away any visible fat from the steak.  Sear the steak in the oil
over medium to med-high heat.  Place the steak in a casserole dish.
For extra flavoring, pour the water into the skillet you seared the
meat in, and stir.  Pour this over the meat, then add all the other
ingredients. Cook uncovered at 350F for 30 minutes, or longer if you
prefer your meat well done. Makes 4 servings, 4.5 oz each, plus
sauce, but without optional gravy. LIGHT GRAVY: (Optional) Heat 1
Tablespoon of vegetable oil, and stir in 2 Tablespoons of whole-wheat
flour. Take a cup of liquid from the meat and stir into the roux.
Stir until thickened, and serve over the meat. Using the Gravy adds
30 calories and 3 grams of fat; nutrient values of the meat liquid
and other ingredients are included in the original analysis.
