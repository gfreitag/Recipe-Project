CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Toss the pecans and raisins with
1/2 c flour and set aside.  Sift the remaining flour, the baking
powder, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg together and set aside.  Beat
the butter and sugar in a mixer bowl until light and fluffy.  Mash
the bananas and beat into the butter mixture.  Add the eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition.  Fold in the sifted flour
mixture and bourbon alternately, beginning and ending with the dry
ingredients. Fold in the pecan mixture. Pour the batter into an
ungreased 10" tube pan. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool and remove
from the pan. Cut the cake in slices and serve with Bourbon Creme
Anglaise spooned over it. BOURBON CREME ANGLAISE: Heat the cream and
sugar in a small saucepan just until the sugar dissolves.  Remove
from the heat.  Whisk the egg yolks together in a mixing bowl. Slowly
beat in a third of the cream mixture; then whisk the egg yolks back
into the cream mixture.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly,
just until thickened. Be careful not to let the mixture boil. Remove
to a clean bowl. Stir in the syrup and bourbon. Cool completely. From
