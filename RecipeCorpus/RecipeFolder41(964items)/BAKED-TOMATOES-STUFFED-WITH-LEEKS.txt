Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
6 md Tomatoes
1 lg Or 2 small leeks
4 tb Olive oil
Salt & pepper
Tabasco sauce
6 tb Dry bread crumbs
3 ts Olive oil
3 tb Chopped parsley
Preheat oven to 400 F.

Grease a shallow baking dish or pan large enough to hold the 6
tomatoes. Wash tomatoes and cut off stem end (not too close). Using a
teaspoon, scoop out seeds and pulp and discard. Turn tomatoes upside
down on paper towels to drain and place in baking dish.

Wash leeks very thoroughly and pat dry.  Cut away the tough green
tips. Lay the leek pieces flat on a cutting board and slice crosswise
very fine. Heat the 4 tablespoons butter in a saute' pan, add leeks
and cook until soft (do not overcook). Season with salt, pepper, and
Tabasco.

Spoon 1/6 of the cooked leeks into each tomato, then a tablespoon of
breadcrumbs over them.  Place a 1/2 ts olive oil on top of each
tomato. Lower oven temperature to 350 F and bake for 12 minutes.

Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.
