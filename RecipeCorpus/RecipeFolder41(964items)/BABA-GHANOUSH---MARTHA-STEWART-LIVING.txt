Title: BABA GHANOUSH - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Appetizers, Dips/spread
Yield: 4 1/2 cups
6 md Eggplants, about 1 1/4 lb
-each
1    Clove garlic, peeled and
-finely chopped
5 tb Tahini (sesame paste)
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
3 ts Salt
2 pn Freshly ground pepper
Chopped parsley, for garnish
1. Heat oven to 425'. Place each eggplant directly over the flame of
a gas burner or under a broiler, turning occasionally until skin is
lightly charred, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and
roast for about 30 minutes, or until the eggplants have shriveled and
feel very soft all over when pressed. Let sit until cool enough to
handle.

2. Slit each eggplant open and remove seeds (don't worry if you miss a
few). Scrape flesh from skin with a table knife and transfer to a
large bowl. It's okay if some charred skin is included. Discard skin
and seeds.

3. Mash eggplant with a fork or whisk untl it is fairly smooth but
still has a few lumps. Mix in garlic, tahini, and lemon juice. Add
salt and pepper. Adjust flavors as desired. Garnish baba ghanoush
with chopped parsley and serve at room temperature.
