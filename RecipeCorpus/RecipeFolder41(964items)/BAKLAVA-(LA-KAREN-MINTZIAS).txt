Title: BAKLAVA (LA KAREN MINTZIAS)
Categories: Desserts, Greek
Yield: 60 Servings
3 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 1/2 c  Water
2 tb Honey
1 ea Lemon rind
1 ea Stick cinnamon
4 ea Whole cloves
1 1/4 lb Walnuts & blanched almonds*
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground cloves
1 1/2 lb Commercial filo sheets
1 lb Sweet butter, melted
*Note- Walnuts and almonds should be chopped medium fine. Combine 3
cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices in a
saucepan and bring to boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15
minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool. Meanwhile,
in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and
ground spices and set aside. Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed
paper and then a damp towel. Keep covered except when removing to
assemble the baklava. Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and
refrigerate to reserve for the top. Using a large pastry brush,
butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch by 3-inch baking pan. Lay a filo
sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with warm butter, and repeat
using 8 sheets.  Scoop up a handful of the nut-spice mixture and
sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan. Lay on 3 or more
filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with the
nut mixture. Continue until all the nuts and filo are used. (The
important things here are to butter each filo and spread the nuts
evenly. The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times
during the procedure.) Now you can remove the reserved sheets from
the refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet.
Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom
into diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired.  Be sure
the knife touches the bottom of the pan as you cut.  Heat the
remaining butter to sizzling and pour over the top.  Bake in a 300
degree oven for 1 1/4 hours or until golden chestnut in color and
flaky.  Remove from the oven (in the pan) to a rack, and spoon the
cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve each
piece individually. Source: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras
