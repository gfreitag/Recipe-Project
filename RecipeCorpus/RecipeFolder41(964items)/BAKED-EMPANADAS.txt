MMMMM----------------------TO COMPLETE DISH---------------------------
2 pk Frozen empanada dough (13oz)
-20 5-inch disks
Make the Bean Filling:  Coarsely mash the beans.  Stir in the onion,
garlic, chilies, chili powder, cumin and vinegar.

Make the Beef Filling: Saute the beef, onion, and garlic and a
skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat into small bits. Cook
until the beef is browned and the vegetables are soft, about 5
minutes. Drain off fat in a colander. Wipe out skillet with paper
towels, and return the meat mixture to it, off the heat. Stir in the
chilis, chili powder, cumin and salt to taste.

Finish the dish: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place a disk of
daugh on a work surface. Spoon 2 scant tablespoons of bean filling
onto one half leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Top with 1
tablespoon grated cheese if you like. Brush the edges of the dough
with water. Fold the dough over the filling, forming a half circle.
With the tines of a fork, press the edges together firmly, and poke a
few holes, in the top to let the steam escape.  REpeat until you have
used all the filling. Use the same procedure with the meat filling
topping with 1 tablespoon salsa if you wish. Place the empanadas on a
baking sheet, and coast them lightly with vegetable oil spray. Bake
for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or at room
temperature.
