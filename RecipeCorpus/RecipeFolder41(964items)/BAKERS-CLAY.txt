MM format by Ursula R. Taylor.
Mix together into a stiff dough.  Knead 5 minutes. Roll out dough
to 1/4" thickness and cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Place on
cookie sheets. Bake in a 350~ oven for 1 hour or until hard when
tapped with a fork. The "cookie" shuld ping.
Can be decorated with water color or poster paint and coat with
varnish, spray lacquer or plastic.  This will prevent there getting
soft and spoiled.  DO NOT DOUBLE MIXTURE AND USE WITHIN 4 HOURS AFTER
MIXING.
Personal Note from Ursula Taylor - folks Lynne didn't say - but I
would think that if you're going to use these "cookies" as ornaments
be sure to put a hole in the top of them before baking them.
