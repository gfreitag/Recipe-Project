Title: BALSAMICO CHICKEN WITH OLIVES
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2    Recipe Fricasseed Chicken
- frozen or fresh
3 tb Tomato paste
1/2 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 c  Balsamic vinegar
3/4 c  Pitted green olives; drained
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
DEFROST THE FRICASSEED CHICKEN, if frozen. Arrange the chicken pieces
in an oven-proof casserole or Dutch oven. Combine the tomato paste,
broth and vinegar in a small bowl, and add to the chicken. Add the
olives, cover and place in the oven. Turn the oven on to 375F and
bake for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place the fricassee sauce in a small
saucepan over medium heat, and cook until it is thick enough to coat
a wooden spoon, about 5-to-10 minutes. Uncover the casserole and
strain the sauce over the chicken. Continue to bake, uncovered,
another 5 minutes. To serve, arrange the chicken and sauce in a
serving bowl or on a deep serving platter, and sprinkle with the
parsley.
