Title: BABY POTATO PANCAKES
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 2 Servings
225 g  Potatoes, cooked
25 g  Sunflower margarine
4 tb Milk, 3-4 tbs
1 lg Egg; beaten
2 tb Crme fraiche
Salt and pepper
Unsalted butter; melted
Serves 2-3

These little rounds of golden-brown, puffed potato mixture are very
scrumptious and take some resisting! Warming food for cold weather,
they are lovely with coleslaw or a tomato and onion salad.

Put the potatoes in the blender with the margarine and the milk and
work to a smooth pure. Add the beaten egg and crme fraiche and
liquidize again. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Heat a griddle or a large heavy pan over a moderate heat until it is
hot, and brush it with melted butter. Stir the potato batter, drop it
in tablespoonfuls on to the griddle to form small rounds, and cook the
pancakes until bubbles appear on the surface. Add more melted butter
as necessary. Turn the pancakes, and cook them on the other side
until they are golden. Transfer them to a platter and keep them warm,
covered, in a very low oven until ready to serve.
