Title: BAGUETTES
Categories: Breads, French
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 c  ;Water, lukewarm
1/2 ts Salt
1 pk Yeast, dry
1 tb Shortening
3 1/2 c  Flour; sifted
1 tb Sugar
Combine in a small bowl the water, salt, yeast, and sugar. Add the
shortening and let proof.  Sift the flour into a large bowl. Make a
well in the center and gradually add liquid, stirring constantly.
Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough starts to leave the sides of
the bowl. Turn out and knead for 10 minutes. Place the dough in a
lightly greased bowl and cover with a clean tea towel and let rise
about 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down and let rise again for 30 to 45
minutes. Punch down and let rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough onto
a floured board and roll into a 15" x 10" oblong.  Roll up tightly
toward you, beginning with the wide side. With a hand on each end,
roll the loaf back and forth to taper the ends and lengthen the loaf.
Place diagonally on a greased and cornmeal- sprinkled cookie sheet.
Slash at 2" intervals and let rise uncovered for about 1 1/2 hours.
Place in a 425 F oven.  For the first 15 minutes, spray with a fine
mist of water every four minutes. Reduce heat to 350 F and bake 20
minutes longer.  The loaf should be golden brown and slide off the
sheet easily.
