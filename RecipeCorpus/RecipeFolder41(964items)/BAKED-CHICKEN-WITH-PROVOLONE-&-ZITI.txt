Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Boneless chicken breasts
1/2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Dill
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Parsley
3 c  Prego sauce or your own
2 lg Slices provolone cheese
Ziti, make the amount you
-think you will eat!
Put the chicken breasts in a baking pan, sprayed with a non-stick
spray. Sprinkle herbs ontop of chicken breasts. Bake uncovered at
350F for 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat the sauce and cook the ziti
separate- ly (cook ziti according to directions on the box). Once the
ziti is cooked and drained, return to the saucepan and put a pat of
margarine or butter in it. Mix well, and pour into another 1 1/2 qt
sprayed baking dish. When the chicken is finished baking, put it
ontop of the ziti, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Pour the sauce
ontop of all and place the cheese ontop of the chicken. Put under the
broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
