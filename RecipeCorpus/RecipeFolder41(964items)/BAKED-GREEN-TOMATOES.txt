Title: BAKED GREEN TOMATOES
Categories: Casseroles, Harned 1994, Kentucky, Southern, Vegetables
Yield: 24 Servings
15 lg Green tomatoes
Salt and pepper
2 c  Brown sugar
3 c  Coarse butter-cracker crumbs
2    Sticks butter
Cut tomatoes in half and arrange in an oiled shallow casserole.
Season with salt and pepper and spread each with a tablespoon of
sugar. Cover with crumbs and dot with butter. Bake at 350 F until
tender but still firm - the time will depend on the size and
greenness of the tomatoes - but will probably range from 30 to
40    minutes.

Note: 1/2" slices may be baked in this same manner. Bake 25 minutes.
