Title: BACCALA ALLA BOLOGNESE
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1 3/4 lb Dried codfish
Flour; for dredging
4 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
1    Clove garlic; minced
3 tb Fresh parsley; minced
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Lemon; juiced
Put the cod in a deep dish, add cold water to cover, and let it soak
for 2 days in the refrigerator in order for it to "plump" up and
change the water several times. Rinse and dry the fish and cut it
into 2-inch chunks. Dredge the fish in the flour, shaking off the
excess. In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbl of the butter and the olive
oil. Add the fish pieces and brown them well on all sides over
medium-high heat. Sprinkle the fish with the minced garlic and
parsley and stir the mixture gently. Cut the remaining 2 Tbl butter
into bits and add it to the pan. Sprinkle the fish with salt and
pepper and pour over the lemon juice. Serve immediately.
