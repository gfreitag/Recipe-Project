I found this recipe in an old cookbook I picked up at a yard sale.
The title, 150 Recipes  Casserole Cookery One-dish Meals for the Busy
Gourmet and the authors are Marian and Nino Tracy and it was first
printed in 1940! The last print date is October 1950!
I hope that you get a kick out of some of these recipes. Trish.
