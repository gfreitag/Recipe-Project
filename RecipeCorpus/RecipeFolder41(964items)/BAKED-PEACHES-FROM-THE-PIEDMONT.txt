6    Ripe peaches
1/3 c  Sugar

Try this with white peaches, if available, for a subtle variation on
the original.

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F and set a rack in the middle level. Rinse,
halve and pit the peaches. Puree 2 of the peach halves in a food
processor. Place the puree in a bowl and add the sugar, crushed
macaroons and the egg yolk. Cover each peach half with this filling

remaining butter over the peaches and bake for about 30 minutes,
until the peaches are baked through and the filling is a deep golden
color. Serve hot or at room temperature.
