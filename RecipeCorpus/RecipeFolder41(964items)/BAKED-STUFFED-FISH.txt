-4-6 servings
2 c  Soft bread cubes;about
-1/2" cubes
1    Small onion; chopped
-fine
1    Green pepper; blanched
-and chopped
8 oz Imitation crabmeat
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  HELLMANS mayo
Salt & pepper to taste
Mix all these ingredients together and roll up in fish fillets,
securing them with toothpicks. Divide it among four or five
good-sized pieces. Bake at 400 for 30 minutes. During last 10 minutes
pour newburg sauce over fish.
It's good with flounder, but any white fish will do. I've used large
cod and catfish fillets and butterflied them. Just enough so you can
roll it up over the stuffing.
