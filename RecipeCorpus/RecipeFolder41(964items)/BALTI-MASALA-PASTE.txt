Title: BALTI MASALA PASTE
Categories: Indian, Spices, Sauces, Balti
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Recipe Balti masala spice
6 fl Vinegar (spiced or plain, as
-you prefer)
6 fl Vegetable oil (sunflower or
-peanut)
A paste which, like Balti sauce, appears repeatedly in Balti recipes.

Place the ground spices in a bowl.  Add vinegar, and water sufficient
to make a paste.  Let stand 10-15 minutes.

Heat the oil in a wok.  Add the paste.  Stir-fry until the water
content is cooked out (about 3-5 minutes) and the paste thickens and
begins to bubble with the same kind of boiling noise that oatmeal
makes. Remove from heat.

Bottle while hot in boiled jars.  When in the bottle, add heated oil
to top off, seal, and store.
