Title: BAVARIAN CREAM
Categories: Desserts, Dairy
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
2 tb Cold water
2    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ds Salt
1 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Heavy cream, or 2 cups
-whipped topping
Sprinkle gelatin on cold water. Beat egg yolks, sugar & salt in the
top of a double boiler. Beat until light. Add milk. Cook over boiling
water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick & smooth. Add
softened gelatin, dissolve. Add vanilla. Cool until thick, stirring
often. Whip cream until it is very thick, but not stiff, fold into
the cooled gelatin mixture. Pour into a 6-cup mold rinsed in cold
water, chill until set. Unmold, serve with chocolate sauce. Makes 6
servings.

My Notes: I added an extra egg yolk, & about half a pint of red
raspberries to the milk mixture to make sure it would thicken. I
didn't have heavy cream, so I used a cup of lite sour cream.
