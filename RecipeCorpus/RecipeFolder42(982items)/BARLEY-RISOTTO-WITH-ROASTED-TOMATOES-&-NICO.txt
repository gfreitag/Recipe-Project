Title: BARLEY RISOTTO WITH ROASTED TOMATOES & NICO
Categories: Rice and gr, Side dishes, Texas, Tomatoes
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Tomatoes (about 1 1/2
Pounds) -- cut crosswise
5 c  Water -- more if needed
1 1/2 c  Chicken stock -- homemade or
Canned
1 tb Olive oil
1    Onion -- chopped fine
1 1/2 c  Pearl  barley (about 11
Ounces)
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Butter
6 tb Parmesan cheese -- grated
2 tb Heavy cream -- optional
3 tb Nicoise olives -- chopped
Heat the oven to 300 degrees.  Put the halved tomatoes, cut-side up,
on a baking sheet.  Dry the tomatoes in the oven until shriveled but
still juicy, not hard and dry, about 2 hours. Let cool and then cut
into 1/2-inch pieces.

In a medium saucepan, bring the water and stock to a boil. Remove
from the heat and keep covered.

In another medium saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the
onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5
minutes.

Add the barley and stir to coat.  Add about a third of the hot stock
mixture and cook at a gentle boil, stirring occasionally, until
absorbed. Add another third of the stock and cook, stirring
frequently, until absorbed.  Add the remaining stock and the salt and
cook, stirring frequently, until the barley is tender, about 1 hour
and 15 minutes total cooking time. Any stock that has not been
absorbed should be thickened by the starch from the barley.

Stir the barley vigorously to make the texture creamier. If it is
dry, add more water.  Stir in the butter, Parmesan, the cream, if
using, and three quarters of both the tomatoes and the olives.  Serve
the barley risotto topped with the remaining tomatoes and olives.
