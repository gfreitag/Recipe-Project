Title: BARBECUED INDIAN SPICE TURKEY
Categories: Indian, Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Turkey breast, boned and
-halved, partially frozen
1 c  Plain nonfat yogurt
1 tb Minced seeded jalapeno chili
1 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
2 ds Nutmeg
1 ds Garlic powder
Trim halved turkey breast slices of all fat and skin. Butterfly meat
by using a sharp knife, starting in center of one long side and
cutting in half to within 1/2" of second long side; open meat like a
book (using partially frozen turkey makes this process easier). Set
meat flat on a platter.

Mix together yogurt, chili, cumin, pepper, nutmeg, and garlic powder
in a small bowl.  Rub mixture over turkey, cover, and chill overnight
(or at least 2 hours).

Prepare barbecue.  Grill meat 4 inches from heat source until cooked
through, about 4-6 minutes per side. Let stand for 5 minutes, then cut
diagonally into slices. Serve with a rice salad. Makes about 6
servings.
