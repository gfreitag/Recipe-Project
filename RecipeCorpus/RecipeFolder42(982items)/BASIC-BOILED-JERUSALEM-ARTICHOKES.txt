Title: BASIC BOILED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES
Categories:
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Jerusalem artichokes
Salt
Ulsalted butter -- melted
1.  Wash and gently scrub the artichokes under cook, running water.
If they have just come out of the refrigerator, let them until they
warm to room temperature, about an hour. 2. Put just enough cold
water to cover the artichokes in a kettle that will comfortably hold
them. Turn on the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a boil.
3. Throw in a small handful of salt and add the artichokes. Let the
water return to biling and reduce the heat to medium. Simmer,
uncovered, until they are to the level of tenderness that the
individual recipe requires. To eath them plain or in salads, they
should be just tender and may take as little as 10 minutes ; for
creamed, or mashed, artichokes, they should be as soft as boiled
potatoes and may take as long as half an hour. 4. Drain them well and
serve warm with lots of melted butter following a recipe for mashed
potatoes.
