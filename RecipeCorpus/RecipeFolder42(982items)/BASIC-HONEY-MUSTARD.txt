Now the fun begins.  Flavor can be varied by the addition of herbs.
Such as:

3 Tbl fresh, finely chopped tarragon leaves OR/ 1 1/2 tsp dried
tarragon leaves

Or freshly chopped cilantro add nice flavor, especially when used with
chicken

Or be a mad chemist in the kitchen ad add a mixture of this and that:

2   Tb freshly ground pepper 1/2 ts nutmeg 1/2 ts ground cloves 1 ts
ground ginger

Add any of the above to the basic honey mustard "to taste". Any extra
can be kept in a tightly sealed jar, for about 6 months. Use in
sauces served with meat, especially good with pork.
