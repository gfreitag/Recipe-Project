1/4 ts Sugar
2 3/4 c  Better for Bread flour
2 tb Gluten
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Baking soda
1 c  Sharp cheddar cheese;shredde
1/2 c  Canned corned beef;chopped

Place all the ingredients (EXCEPT THE 1/3 CUP CORNED BEEF) into the
pan in the order listed. Select white bread and push "Start." Add the
chopped corned beef at the "beep," 88 minutes into the cycle. (33
min. with DAK Turbo II) This bread should be stored in the
refrigerator or freezer. This tasty bread is reminiscent of the 1950s
open-faced sandwich favorite made by covering split hamburger buns
with canned comed beef, cheese slicesand a dollop of barbecue sauce,
then heating them in the oven. Shared by Barb Day
