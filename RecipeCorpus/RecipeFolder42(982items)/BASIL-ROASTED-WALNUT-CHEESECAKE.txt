CIBO Cheese is a goat cheese mixed with cream and other flavorings. I
bought it at an upscale grocery store, in the deli section.

Make the crust:

Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Process flour, salt and
butter just until combined and crumbly in texture. Add water, 2
tablespoons at a time. Do not overprocess. Press evenly into pan, up
1 1/2 inches at the side. Allow to chill while making the filling.

Make the filling:

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Combine CIBO goat cheese, ricotta, butter, eggs (adding one at a time,
processing well after each addition), flour, salt and pepper. Pour
filling into shell, bake until puffed and brown for 25-30 minutes.
