Title: BANANA CHOCOLATE CHIP LOAF
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter, softened
2    Eggs
1 c  Mashed ripe bananas
1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 c  Nuts (optional)
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9" x 5" x 3" loaf pan. Cream the
sugar and butter with an electric mixer until light. Add the eggs and
mix well. On low speed, mix in the bananas, milk, and vanilla. Stop
the mixer and add the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix until just
combined, then stir in the mini chocolate chips and nuts. Transfer
batter to prepared pan. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the
center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan 5 minutes;
turn onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

** NOTE:  Mini chocolate chips work better than regular chips because
the regular size ones tend to sink to the bottom of the loaf during
baking.
