Recipe by: Woman's Day Cookbook 1. Fill a roasting pan or a 13x9-inch
baking dish half full of hot tap water and place on an oven rack in
the center of the oven.  Heat the oven to 350F.

2.  In a small heavy saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the sugar over medium
heat for about 5 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally until the
sugar has melted and turns golden brown. (Watch the sugar carefully
after it liquefies.  If it gets too dark it will taste burned.)
Immediately pour the mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf pan so the sugar
covers the bottom of the pan completely.

3.  In a large bowl, beat the banana and the remaining 3/4 cup sugar
with an electric mixer on high speed until completely liquefied with
no lumps. Beat in the eggs.

4.  Add the evaporated milk, vanilla, nutmeg, and salt. Beat with a
mixer on low speed or stir just until blended. Pour the mixture into
the loaf pan. (Don't worry if the caramel cracks.)

5.  Carefully place the baking pan in the center of the pan of hot
water. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes to 20 minutes, or until a knife
inserted near the center comes out clean and the top is browned.
Remove the pan from the water and set on a wire wrack to cool
completely. When cooled, cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.

6.  To serve,  run a thin knife around the inside edges of the
custard. Invert a serving plate over the pan. Invert the pan and
plate together. Lift the pan and allow the syrup to runonto the
plate. Serve right away or cover loosely with plastic wrap and
refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut into 10 slices.
