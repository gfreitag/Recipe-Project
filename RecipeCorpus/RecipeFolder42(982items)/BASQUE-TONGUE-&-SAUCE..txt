more hours. When the tongue is tender, run cold water over it and
skin it. Be sure to trim the membranes under the tongue. Next slice
the tongue to about 1/4 inch slices. (The tongue can be fixed a day
or two ahead and then wrapped in saran wrap and refrigerated. Saute
the garlic, onion and green pepper until golden brown. Add tomato
sauce, pimento and sugar. Simmer slowly for 15 minutes. Add the
tongue and continue simmering until the tongue is good and hot. This
dish is good hot or cold. The sauce can also be used for tripe, pigs
feet or any left over meat. Walt
