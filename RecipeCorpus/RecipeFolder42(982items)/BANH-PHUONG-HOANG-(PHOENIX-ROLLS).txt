2    Fileted  chicken breast
10    Pieces of ham 2" by 1/2"
1/4 lb Shrimp
2    Green onions minced
2 ts Lemon grass minced (fresh)
Salt
Black pepper
Cornstarch
1 c  Cooking oil
1. Cut each chicken breast into 5 thin slices 2. Place shrimp in
mortar and smash into a paste, add onions, lemon grass, salt and
pepper continue mashing until you have a paste 3. Lay chicken fillet
on flat surface, place a piece of ham on 1 end, top ham with 1/10 of
shrimp mixture 4. Roll up , dip in cornstarch and fry in oil until
golden. I have never tried this without the ham, but it seems like it
might work. Dgeign
