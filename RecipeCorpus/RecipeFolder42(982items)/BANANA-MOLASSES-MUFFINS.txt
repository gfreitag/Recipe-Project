Title: BANANA MOLASSES MUFFINS
Categories: Breads, Fruits, Muffins
Yield: 4 Servings
3 ea Bananas; Ripe, Md
1 ea Egg; Large, Unbeaten
2/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Light Molasses Or Syrup
2 tb Shortening, Melted
2 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Walnuts; Chopped, Optional
Mash the bananas until no lumps remain.  Add the unbeaten egg, mixing
well. Beat in the sugar, molasses and the shortening. (NOTE: The
secret of this recipe is to mix the above ingredients well until very
smooth.) Sift the flour, baking power, soda, and salt together and
add to the liquid mixture. As these are a quick bread, do not beat
the dry mixture into the liquid but rather fold it in only until it
is moistened and no streaks remain. Spoon the mixture into a muffin
tin that has been sprayed with a non-stick coating.  Bake at 350
degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until done. Serve warm.
