Title: BANANA MALT
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1    To 2 frozen very ripe
Bananas
1    To 2 Tbs Malt powder
1 c  Rice Milk (maybe more?)
1 ts Vanilla (optional)
Break or slice the banana into small chunks and put in a blender. Add
malt powder.  Add a small amount of the rice milk and start to blend.
Add more rice milk as necessary until the banana goes from chunks to
puree, then blend for another minute or two before adding the rest of
the rice milk and optional vanilla.

If you try to blend all the ingredients at once you're likely to end
up with un-blended banana chunks.

This recipe is a good way to use over-ripe bananas, which we peel and
freeze when they've been on the counter for a bit too long.
