Combine 1 tablespoon of the sugar, warm water and yeast. Stir to
dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Blend egg
into yeast mixture.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, butter, 2 tablespoons
of the remaining sugar and salt into work bowl. Process until mixed,
about 15 seconds.

Turn on processor and slowly add yeast mixture through feed tube to
flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10 seconds.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough milk into flour
mixture so dough forms a ball that cleans the sides of the bowl.
Process until ball turns around bowl about 25 times. Turn off
processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining milk to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lighyly greased surface.  Knead raisins, currants and
candied fruit peel into dough. Shape into smooth ball and place on
greased cookie sheet. Flatten ball into a circle about 6 inches in
diameter. Brush with oil and let stand in warm place until doubled,
about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until bread sounds hollow when tapped, 40 -
50 minutes.

Mix cold water with remaining 1 tablespoon of the sugar.

Remove bread immediately from cookie sheet and place on wire rack.
Brush with sugar-water mixture.  Cool.
