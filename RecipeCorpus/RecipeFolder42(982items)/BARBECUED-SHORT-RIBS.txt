Title: BARBECUED SHORT RIBS
Categories: Meats, Bar-b-q
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Short ribs (or chicken)
2 c  Chicken broth
2 c  :Water, or enough to
-barely cover ribs
1 tb Brown sugar
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
1/4 c  Catsup
2 tb Tomato paste
1 tb Dry mustard
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Chili powder
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
THE DAY BEFORE GRILLING THE RIBS, put the sugar and vinegar in a pot
large enough to hold the ribs and place over medium heat on top of
the stove. Cook until the vinegar reduces and forms a syrup with the
sugar, about 8 minutes. Watch carefully, as the syrup will suddenly
darken in color. Immediately add the broth, water, catsup, tomato
paste, mustard, Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and pepper and
bring to a boil. Add the ribs and cook 20 minutes. (If using chicken,
cook for 10 minutes.) Remove from heat, remove the ribs from the
liquid and place covered in the refrigerator. Cook the liquid over
medium heat until it becomes thick and syrupy. The next day, light a
charcoal grill. Place the ribs on the grill so they are not directly
over the coals and cover the grill so that smoke collects inside. If
your grill does not have a cover, improvise one out of aluminium
foil. Cook for 40 minutes, basting with barbecue sauce every 10
minutes. When ribs are well heated, remove to a platter and serve.
Offer any additional barbecue sauce on the side.
