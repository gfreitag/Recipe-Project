Pastry. 1. Line the quiche pan with the pastry, pinch up a rim, and
prick the bottom all over with a fork. Partially bake the pastry, if
you wish, and set it aside. 2. To make the filling: Whisk together
the eggs, flour, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Blend in the cream,
and then the milk. 3. Evenly distribute whatever cheese, meat, and/or
vegetables you are using in the prepared shell, and pour in the
custard filling. (if you are using high-moisture vegetables, such as
tomatoes, zucchini, or mushrooms, they should be cooked first to
evaporate some of their water content.). 4. Preheat oven to 375.
Place the filled pan on a baking sheet. Generally, custard quiches
should be baked for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custard is just
set. Let the quiche rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing and
serving it. Make one 9 to 11-inch or four 4-inch tarts. This is the
basic custard mixture that goes into many of our quiches. Some of our
favorite combinations appear below, but we hope you'll use them as
inspiration for your own creations. Just about any combination of
grated cheese, vegetables, leftover meat, poultry, or seafood, or
whatever else appeals to you can be added to this all-purpose
custard.JM. Mary Prentiss Inn Cambridge, Massachusetts
