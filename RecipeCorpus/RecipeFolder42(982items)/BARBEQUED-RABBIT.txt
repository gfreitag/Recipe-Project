Title: BARBEQUED RABBIT
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
SEE DIRECTIONS:
Lay the rabbit in salt and water half an hour, scald with boiling
water, wipe dry, grease with butter, and sprinkle with pepper and a
little salt. Lay it on the gridiron, turning often so that it may
cook through and through, without becoming hard and dry.  When brown,
lay on a hot dish, butter plentifully on both sides, and add a little
salt and pepper. Set in the oven, while preparing four teaspoonfuls
of vinegar, one of made mustard, and one of currant jelly or brown
sugar. Pour this over the rabbit, rubbing it in, then pour over the
gravy and serve hot.
