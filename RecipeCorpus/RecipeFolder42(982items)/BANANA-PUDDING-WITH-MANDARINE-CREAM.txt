4 lg Bananas
200 g  Caster sugar
6 tb Mandarine juice
3 tb White rum
4    Eggs, separated
1 pn Salt
3 tb Sugar
210 ml Mandarine juice
Loosely related to a dessert from the English-speaking islands of the
West Indies, this makes a wonderful - and legal - winter fruit
pudding. Despite its richness, it has next to no fat and, if you use
eggs modified with omega 3 oil, it couldn't be more nutritionally
sound.

Mash 4 large bananas (if anything, slightly overripe) with 200 g
caster sugar, 6 tablespoons mandarin juice and 3 tablespoons white
rum. Separate 4 eggs and beat the whites with a pinch of salt until
they stand in stiff peaks. Fold the whites through the banana mixture
gently and turn the mixture into a serving dish or dishes. Chill for
several hours until set.

Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with 3 tablespoons of sugar until thick
and creamy. Tip the mixture into the top of a double boiler or a
basin over simmering water, add 210 mL of mandarine juice and whisk
over a gentle heat until it reaches coating consistency. Don't let it
boil. Chill for several hours. Serve with the pudding.
