Title: BARBECUE FISH SAUCE
Categories: Barbecue
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3/4 c  Onion -- chopped
3/4 c  Catsup
3/4 c  Water
1/3 c  Lemon juice
3 tb Sugar
3 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Prepared mustard
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
Saute onion in oil in medium heavy saucepan over medium-high heat
until tender. Combine with all ingredients and simmer 10 - 15 mins.

Using any mild fish, fileted or whole, place fish in wire basket that
will hold fish firmly in place or put a wire mesh on your grill.
Brush fish with seafood sauce occasionally until fish is flaky.

This sauce is also excellent on shrimp.

Oh, and if you're not happy with the freshness of your fish, soak it
in milk for a few hours. It takes the "fishy" smell out of the fish.
