Recipe by: The Ultimate Pasta Machine Cookbook Following the
instructions given in your owner's manual, prepare and set up the
pasta machine with an extruder die to make the desired shape of pasta.

All ingredients must be at room temperature.  Place the liquid
ingredients in a glass measuring cup.  If less than 3/4 cup, add some
water to make up the balance.

Add the dry ingredients to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the
pasta machine on.  Slowly pour the liquid ingredients through the
feed tube. Mix for approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough
appears to be coming together in soft pea-sized crumbs.

Following the instructions given in your owners' manual, begin to
extrude the dough.  Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and
discard. As the pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from
the machine. Cut with a sharp knife or scissors at desired lengths.
Place extruded pasta on a wire rack or on a clean kitchen cloth. Let
sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking, or store for later use.
