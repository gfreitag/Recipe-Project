Title: BARB'S MEATLOAF WITH CHEESE
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Ground beef
1/2 tb Pepper
3/4 c  Cheddar cheese; cubed
1/2 tb Celery seed
1/2    Onion; chopped
1/4 tb Paprika
1/2    Bell pepper; chopped
1/2 c  Milk
1    Egg; beaten
1/2 c  Bread crumbs; dry
1 tb Salt
OVEN TEMP: 350 DEGREES MIX ALL INGREDIENTS TOGETHER. PLACE IN LOAF
PAN. BAKE FOR 1 HOUR 15 MIN. *I LIKE TO FORM THIS IN A BALL AND PLACE
IT ON A RACK TO COOK, SO THAT MOST OF THE FAT DRIPS AWAY FROM THE
MEAT. THIS MEAT LOAF MAKES GREAT SANDWICHES AND IS FLAVORFUL WHEN
COLD.
