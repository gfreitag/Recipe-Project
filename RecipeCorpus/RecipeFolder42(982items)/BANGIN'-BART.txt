Title: BANGIN' BART
Categories: Entrees, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lg Eggplants, unpeeled,
-diced
2 lg Tomatoes, diced
2 lg Onions, finely chopped
2 tb Oil (or clarified
-butter)
2 ts Salt
1 ts Black pepper
In a large frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until it is
translucent. Add the spices and stir for 1 minute. Add the eggplant
and tomato, stir well and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until
vegetables are mushy (about 1/2 hour).

Remove the lid and continue cooking until most of the liquid
evaporates (about 15 minutes). The finished dish should be thick
enough that you could use it as a dip.

NOTES:

*  Indian eggplant, onion and tomato casserole -- This is an Indian
dish, called Baigan Bartha in Hindi.  We make it a lot and call it
"Bangin' Bart." It is eggplant, onions and tomatoes, but not in the
usual way.

In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked to mush, with only a small
amount of tomato, just enough to flavor it. Yield: serves 6-8.

*  I don't make this with any spices but salt and pepper. The genuine
Indian version of the recipe adds various Indian spices; try about 1
t of fresh ginger, about 1/2 t of turmeric, about 1/2 t of cayenne,
and about 1 t of garam masala for a more authentic Indian flavor.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
