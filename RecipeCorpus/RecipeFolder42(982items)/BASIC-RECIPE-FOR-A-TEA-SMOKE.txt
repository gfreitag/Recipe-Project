Title: BASIC RECIPE FOR A TEA SMOKE
Categories: Info
Yield: 4 Servings
--- ENOUGH SMOKE FOR 4 ----
---- CHICKEN BREAST ------
2 tb Raw brown rice
1 tb Brown sugar
4    Whole cloves
Tea leaves from 2 earl Grey
- tea bags, removed from
- packets
1/4 ts Olive oil
2    6oz boneless skinless
- chicken breasts
Take 3 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil 15 inches square and start
rolling the edges under to from a circle that fits in the bottom of
your Dutch oven -- in our case, a foil saucer approximately 5 inches
in diamerter.  When the edge is rolled to about 1 inch high, stop and
flatten it. Then, depress the center to hold the smoke ingredients.

In the depression of the aluminum foil saucer first sprinkle the
rice, then the sugar, cloves and the contents of the tea bags. The
order of ingredients is very important. Place the foil dish in Dutch
oven, cover tightly and cook over high heat until ingredients in the
foil start smoking ~- about 5 minutes.

Brush a steamer platform with the olive oil.  Place the chicken on
platform, skinned side up.  Put into Dutch oven over the smoke
ingredients, cover and continue smoking over high heat until done --
about 11 minutes.
