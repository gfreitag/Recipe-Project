Title: BATTERED ONION CRISPERS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
*****  NONE  *****
Peel and slice 1 large Spanish onion into 3/8-inch strips and set
aside. Sift 1 cup flour and 1 teaspoon paprika into a bowl. Beat 1
egg yolk into 1 cup of ice-cold water and then quickly blend into the
flour. Small lumps may be there, but that's okay.  Its better not to
over mix. Coat 2 or 3 onion strips at a time and drop into 2 inches
of hot oil. Separate with a fork.  Fry 1-2 minutes or until golden
brown.  Drain on paper towels and keep warm until ready to serve.
Sprinkle with lots of salt and pepper.
