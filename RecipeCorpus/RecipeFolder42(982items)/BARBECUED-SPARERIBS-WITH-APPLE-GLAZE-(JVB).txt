9 lb Pork spareribs
A splash of brandy
4 cl Garlic, minced
2 tb Minced fresh marjoram*
1 tb Dry mustard*
1/2 ts Salt

500 ml Apple butter

ingredients into teaspoons.

Place spareribs in large pot, cover with water, add splash of brandy
(or other liquor) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, simmer 45
to 60 minutes - until tender; drain well and cool slightly.

Combine garlic, marjoram, prepared mustard, salt, pepper and rub over
ribs. Arrange on platter, cover and let marinate in refrigerator up
to 24 hours.

Bring all glaze ingredients to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer gently
, stirring often, for 15 minutes, let cool. Refrigerate until ready
to cook.

Let ribs and glaze stand at room temperature a half hour before
cooking. Place ribs on greased grill over low heat; cook until crisp,
turning every 10 to 15 minutes and brushing with glaze during the
last 15 minutes; 30-45 minutes in all.

Or brush ribs with glaze and bake in medium oven, basting occasionally
until they begin to crisp around the edges.
