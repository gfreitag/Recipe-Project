Title: BANANA CHOCOLATE-CHIP SOUFFLES *JB
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lg Egg whites
1/3 c  Sugar
2    Firm-ripe bananas (each
-about 6 ounces)
2 1/2 tb Miniature semisweet
-chocolate chips
Note: Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

Preheat oven to 450 F. and lightly butter six 3/4-cup ramekins (3 1/2
inches in diameter by 1 1/2 inches high).

In a bowl with an electric mixer beat whites until they just hold soft
peaks and gradually beat in sugar until meringue holds stiff peaks.
Coarsely grate bananas onto meringue and gently fold with chocolate
chips into meringue.

Arrange ramekins on a baking sheet and divide mixture evenly among
them, mounding it in centers. Run a knife around sides of ramekins,
freeing mixture to aid rising, and bake soufflés in middle of oven
until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Serve soufflés immediately.

Serves 6.
