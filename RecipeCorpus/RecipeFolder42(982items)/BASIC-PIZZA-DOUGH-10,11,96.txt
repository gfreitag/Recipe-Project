Title: BASIC PIZZA DOUGH 10/11/96
Categories: New text im, Cooking rig
Yield: 1 Servings    2 1/2 ts (1 envelope) dry yeast
1/2 ts sugar
3/4 c  lukewarm water
2 c  all-purpose flour
1 ts salt
3 TB olive oil

Mix the yeast, sugar, 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup flour together in a
bowl and let proof for 10 minutes. Mixture should look frothy. Add
remaining flour, salt and olive oil and mix well. Turn out onto a
lightly floured work surface and knead for 8-10 minutes or until
dough is elastic and smooth. Alternately you can do this with the
dough hook in a heavy duty mixer. Dough should feel moist and tender.
If it's too stiff, add a bit more water.

Place dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat it evenly. Cover and
let rise in a warm spot in kitchen (at least 75 degrees) for 1-2
hours.

Yield: 1 large rectangular pizza
