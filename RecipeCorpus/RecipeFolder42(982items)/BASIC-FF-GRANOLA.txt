Title: BASIC FF GRANOLA
Categories: Low fat, Cereals
Yield: 1 Servings
6    8 C oats
1 c  (approx) concentrated fruit
Juice
1 tb Cinnamon
Raisins
Mix it up in a large bowl, then spread into a jelly-roll type pan.
Bake at 250 F until done, an hour or so, stirring occasionally. Pour
the warm granola back into the mixing bowl and gently fold in dried
fruit. When cool, store in an airtight container.

That's the basic recipe, but it's easy to modify. Here are things I
substitute or add:

honey, nutmeg, maple syrup, Smuckers syrup, amaranth seeds, oat bran,
rye flakes, craisins, dried apricots.

Here are a few baking tricks:

* Don't overcook it. You'll end up with a pan-o-pebbles. Bake only
until "al dente". * It's less messy (with all that stirring) to use a
pan with high sides. * zip lock bags make good storage containers.
