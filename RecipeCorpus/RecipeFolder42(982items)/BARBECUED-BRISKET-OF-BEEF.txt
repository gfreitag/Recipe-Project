Title: BARBECUED BRISKET OF BEEF
Categories: Meats, Bar-b-q
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  White wine
3 c  Apple cider
1/4 c  Honey
2 tb Dijon mustard
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2 tb Brown sugar, packed
1 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Minced fresh ginger root
1 tb Whole coriander
2    Sprigs fresh thyme
1    Brisket of beef (2-1/2 lb)
COMBINE WINE, CIDER, HONEY, mustard, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic,
ginger root, coriander and thyme in Dutch oven or heavy roasting pan.
Add brisket. Cover tightly and place in oven. Turn oven to 350F and
cook 1 hour. Remove brisket from cooking liquid, cover and set aside.
Transfer liquid to medium pan and cook over medium heat until reduced
to a glaze and thick enough to coat back of spoon. Using covered
grill, light about 12 charcoal briquettes and add small piece of
mesquite or other wood. Be sure to place charcoal and wood to one
side of grill. Arrange brisket on grill so that it is not directly
over burning wood. Paint it with some glaze. Place cover on grill and
smoke brisket 1 hour, turning meat and coating with glaze every 15
minutes. Add charcoal or wood, small piece at a time, if fire seems
to get too cold. Remove from grill, thinly slice meat against grain
and serve. Offer any remaining glaze on side.
