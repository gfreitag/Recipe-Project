Title: BANANA CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 70 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Baking soda
6 tb (3/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2 tb Honey
2 tb Warm water
2/3 c  (1 large) mashed banana
"These flavorful crackers are an obvious choice for a breakfast
snack. A wonderful fruit cobbler crust can be made by finely
crumbling these crackers, moistening them with melted butter, and
pressing them into a baking dish. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the
oven to 350~F.

Combine the flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl or in the
food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse
meal. Add the banana and blend well.

In a separate bowl, dissolve the honey in the warm water. Slowly add
the sweetened water to the flour-banana mixture and blend to form a
dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, at most 1/8 inch. With a cookie
cutter or a small glass, cut into 2- to 2-1/2-inch circles. Arrange
the circles on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake
for 15 to 20 minutes, turning over once during baking. These crackers
should be medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 60-70.

VARIATION: Substitute 1-1/2 cups rice flour for an equal amount of the
all-purpose flour.
