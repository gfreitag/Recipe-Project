-SHERI KONOPKO (GXCH63B)
3 c  Matzo farfel
4    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Butter; melted
2 md Bananas; unripe; sliced
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
Pour cold water over farfel; and drain immediately, so that farfel is
moist, not soggy.
Beat eggs with salt, sugar, and melted butter. Mix in farfel.

In greased 1 1/2 qt. baking dish, place 1/2 of farfel mixture.
Arrange bananas on top, and sprinkle with nuts. Top with the rest of
the farfel mixture

Bake at 350 for 45 min. or until set, and lightly browned. I haven't
tried this one, but it looked interesting.
