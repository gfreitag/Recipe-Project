Categories: Breads, Rolls, Dinner, Book, Tried 1994
Yield: 32 Rolls
6 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
2 tb Active dry yeast
1 c  Water
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Margarine/butter
1    Egg
Melted margarine/butter if 	 Desired

In large bow;, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend
well. In small saucepan, heat water, milk and 1/2 cup margarine until
very warm (120-130 F.). Add warm liquid and egg to flour mixture.
Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.
By hand, stir in an additional 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour until dough
pulls clenaly away from sides of bowl. On floured surface, knead 1
1/4 to 1 3/4 cups flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 to
10 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl; cover loosely with plastic
wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80 to 85 F.) until
light and doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. Punch down dough
several times to remove all air bubbles. Divide dough in half. To
make PAN ROLLS, lightly grease two 13x9-inch pans. Divide each half
of dough into 16 equal pieces. Shape each into a ball, pulling edges
under to make a smooth top. PLace balls, smooth side up, in greased
pans. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size,
about 20-30 minutes. Heat oven to 400 F. Uncover dough. Bake at 400
F. for 16 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove rolls from pans
immediately; cool on wire racks. Brush with melted margarine.

TIP: To make dough a day ahead, after first rise time, punch down
dough, cover and refrigerate dough overnight. Shape dough as directed
in recipe; let rise a second time until light and doubled in size,
about 25 to 35 minutes. Source: The Complete Pillsbury Book of Baking
