Title: BASIC CHEESECAKE CRUST:
Categories: Cheesecake, Kooknet, Cheesecakes
Yield: 1 Crust
1 1/2 c  Crushed graham crackers
-(1 package)
1/4 c  Sugar
5 tb Melted butter
Mix the graham crackers and sugar, then add butter and mix with a fork
until completely moistened.  Press mixture into the bottom and up
1/3rd of the side of a 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Variations:  Use ginger snaps instead of graham crackers for a spicier
crust or for cakes like pumpkin. Use chocolate wafers instead of
graham crackers for a chocolate, white chocolate, or certain
fruit-flavored or ~topped cheesecakes like raspberry, cherry, or
orange. For a sweeter, moister crust (do this only if the cheesecake
is going to get eaten quickly, because it gets mushy faster) use
brown sugar instead of white.
