Title: BASIC PREPARATION OF HEADS FEET TAILS EARS &
Categories: Chinese, Info
Yield: 1 Servings
Information Text
One or both of these first two steps is required in all the recipes
that follow.

Step I: Cleaning

Remove any hairs on heads, feet, tails, ears or snouts by singeing
over an open flame or plucking.  Scrub well (using a vegetable brush
if desired) and then sprinkle with salt, rubbing it into the skin.
Rinse well with cool water; pat dry.  Remove any excess fat. Poultry
feet (chicken, duck or turkey) must be stripped of their outer scaly
skin; plunge them in boiling water for 1 minute, as you would do
before peeling tomatoes. Proceed with recipe.

Step II: Parboiling

Parboil in salted water (1 teaspoon salt for each quart water) for 5
minutes.  Drain, discarding water. This step serves the propose of
ridding the meat of running blood as well as clinging meat, fat or
bone residue, thereby adding clarity to sauces.

All these recipes are from "Innards and Other Variety Meats". Jana
Allen and Margret Gin.  101 Productions. San Francisco, 1974.
