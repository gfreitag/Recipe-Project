Title: BANANA FLOUR
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Ripe Bananas
Slice and dry full grown bananas. Use only the fruit that is full
grown as green bananas contain too much starch. After drying, grind
or pound in a mortar, then pass the powder through a sieve. This
flour can be used in equal parts with regular flour in making
desserts where a starchy substance is used.
