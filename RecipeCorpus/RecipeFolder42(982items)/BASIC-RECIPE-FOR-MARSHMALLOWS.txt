Title: BASIC RECIPE FOR MARSHMALLOWS
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 1 Batch
2 pk Gelatin, unflavored
1/2 c  ;Water, cold
2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Corn syrup, light
3/4 c  ;Water
2 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Sugar, confectioners;
-mixed with
1/4 c  Cornstarch
Combine the gelatin and cold water in a large mixing bowl.  Let the
mixture stand while preparing the sugar syrup.

Lightly oil a two-quart saucepan.  Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and
three-quarters of a cup of water in the saucepan.  Cook over medium
heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves.  Cover, and
bring to a boil.  Remove the cover as soon as the mixture boils;
cook, without stirring, to 245 F. (firm ball stage).  Remove from the
heat. Pour the hot syrup slowly into the softened gelatin, combining
with a mixer. The entire process should take 15 minutes. Add the
vanilla at the very end of the beating process.  At this point the
marshmallow mixture should be very light and fluffy.

Lightly oil an 8"x8"x2" pan.  Sprinkle half the confectioners' sugar-
cornstarch mixture over the bottom; pour the marshmallow mixture over
this. Chill overnight in the refrigerator.

When you are ready to cut the marshmallows, sprinkle the rest of the
confectioner's sugar-cornstarch mixture over the top of the
marshmallow. Lift the entire piece out of the pan onto a cutting
board. Use very sharp scissors, dipped into cold water periodically,
to cut the marsh- mallow into one-inch square pieces.  Roll pieces in
the confectioners' sugar-cornstarch mixture; there will be enough
left in the bottom of the pan for this step.  Let the marshmallows
dry on a cooling rack for an hour or two.  Store in an airtight
container. The marshmallows will stay moist at least three weeks.

This recipe makes 64 one-inch marshmallows or 128 half-inch
marshmallows.
