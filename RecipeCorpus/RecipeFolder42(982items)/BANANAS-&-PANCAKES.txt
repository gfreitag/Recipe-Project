Title: BANANAS & PANCAKES
Categories: Low fat, Desserts
Yield: 3 Servings
1 lg Or 1-2 small bananas per
Person
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Calvados, grand marnier or
Cointreau
5 fl Oz orange juice
2 tb Molasses sugar
1    Egg
4 oz Flour
10 fl Oz lager beer
Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way
(I used a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan). Fold each
pancake in half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle
(if you're as bad at cooking pancakes as I am, they'll come out in
bits anyway - if so, pretend it didn't happen!), and place them in a
large flan dish.

Peel bananas, cut in half long-ways and in half again cross-ways, and
place face-down on top of the pancakes. Put the remaining ingredients
into a frying pan or small saucepan, and boil for 3-4 minutes, until
just beginning to be syrupy.  Pour over bananas and pancakes, and
bake in a moderate oven (Mark 4 - 350 F) for 20-30 minutes.

I served this with fromage frais (cream substitute) and a chocolate
sauce, for which the recipe follows:
