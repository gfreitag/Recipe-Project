Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans.

yolk in the top of the double boiler. Cook, stirring constantly, over
hot water until smooth. Remove from heat.
Sift the flour with the baking soda and salt into a medium bowl.
Beat the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer until
light. Slowly beat in the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the two
remaining egg yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each
addition. Slowly add the chocolate mixture.
Combine the tomato sauce, cream and vanilla in a small bowl. Add
to the batter in thirds, alternating with thirds of the flour mixture.
Beat the egg whites until stiff; fold into the batter.
Pour the batter into prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick
inserted in the centre comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool on a
wire rack before unmolding.
FROSTING: Combine water, corn syrup and sugar in a medium
saucepan. Heat to boiling; boil until the mixture thickens and forms
a ball when a small spoonful is dropped into cold water (about 240F
on a candy thermometer).
Beat the egg whites in a large bowl of the electric mixer until
stiff. Slowly beat in the hot syrup. Combine to beat until spreading
consistency. Beat in orange juice and vanilla. Spread over bottom
layer, the sides and tops of cake. SERVES 8-10
