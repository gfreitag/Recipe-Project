Preparing the Pastry: ==================== 1. In a bowl, combine the
flour, sugar and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
resembles coarse meal. Add the water and stir just until the dough
comes together. Shape into a disk, cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes or overnight.

2. Preheat the oven to 375øF. On a floured surface, roll out the
dough to an 11" round. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the
overhang to 1/2", fold it under itself and crimp decoratively. Freeze
until firm, about 10 minutes. Bake the pie shell for about 25 minutes
at 375øF. for about 25 minutes or until golden. Let cool on a rack.

Preparing the Filling: ===================== 3. In a small saucepan,
heat the cream just until boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in
the chocolate until melted. Transfer to a bowl and add the salt.
Refrigerate, sitrring often, until cooled and thickened, about 45
minutes. Arrange the banana pieces vertically on the pie shell in
concentric circles. Pour the choclate over them and refrigerate until
firm, about 2 hours.

4. Meanwhile, heat the milk in a heavy saucepan. In a bowl, combine
the sugar and cornstarch. Stir in the egg yolks, then whisk the
mixture into the milk. Whisk over low heat until the custard thickens
and almost boils, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, add the
coconut and vanilla and let stand until cooled, stirring. Refrigerate
until chilled, about 20 minutes.

5. Spread the coconut custard over the pie and refrigerate until firm,
about 2 hours. Just before serving, arrange the Banana Brittle over
the top of the pie.

BANANA BRITTLE: ============== This sweet, crunch brittle makes a fun
snack on its own or a clever decoration for sundaes, cakes and pies.

Preheat oven to 350øF. On a large baking sheet, melt the butter in
the oil. Spread to coat the pan evenly and sprinkle with 3 Tb. of the
sugar. Cover with the banana slices in a slightly overlapping layer.
Sprinkle with the remaining 2 Tb.sugar, the cinnamon and peanuts.

Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the slices around the edge are
crisp and golden. Let cool slightly so they firm up. Transfer the
browned slices to a plate and bake the remaining slices for about 3
minutes or until browned.

(MAKE AHEAD): The brittle can be wrapped in wax paper and kept in an
air-tight container for up to 5 days.
