Title: BANANA LOAF (VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
3 md Ripe bananas, mashed
1 ts Baking soda
2 tb Ground flax seed, mixed with
2 tb Water
1/4 c  Applesauce
1 c  Packed brown sugar
1 1/2 c  Flour (use up to 1cup whole
Wheat ..half WW and half
White works best...all WW
Doesn't cook quite right)
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
"Cream" applesauce and brown sugar, add flax mixture. Mash bananas and
baking soda together, add to the other mixture. Mix dry ingredients
together. Stir wet and dry to moisten. Use a 9 x 5 inch loaf ban
(nonstick or sprayed with Pam). Cook at 350 (175C) for about an hour
until it passes the toothpick test.

Note: I usually add some vanilla as well. It's supposed to make 16
servings, but they are paper thin slices--so I'd guess 8-10 real
people servings. I haven't tried freezing it yet.

cookbook.
