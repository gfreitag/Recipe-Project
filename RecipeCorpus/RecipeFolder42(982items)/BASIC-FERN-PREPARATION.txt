Tatum writes: "The young, tender, tightly curled fronds - croziers or
fiddleheads - of bracken (or brake ferns) and of ostrich and cinnamon
ferns are all prepared in the same way.

"Rub off the fuzz (or, for some ferns, the scaly coating) of the
young, crisp fronds, wash them and place them, lying flat, in a
saucepan or skillet with a small amount of boiling salted water.
Bring water again to a boil.  Turn to low heat, cover and simmer for
10 to 20 minutes, or until fronds are just tender (time will depend
on the size and kind of fronds)."

Season with butter, salt and pepper to taste, or serve with lemon
juice of any sauce suitable for asparagus.
