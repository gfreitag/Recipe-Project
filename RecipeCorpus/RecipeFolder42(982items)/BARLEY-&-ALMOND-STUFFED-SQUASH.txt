Title: BARLEY & ALMOND STUFFED SQUASH
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
1 md Acorn squash, or another
-winter squash of a similar
-size
1/3 c  Almonds; chopped
1 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Onions; chopped
1/2 ts Thyme
1 c  Barley; cooked
1 tb Tamari
Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and membrane and
place the squash cut-side down on a lightly oiled baking dish. Bake
at 350 degrees until the squash is still firm, but tender enough to
easily scoop out with a spoon, about 45 minutes.

After the squash has been baking about 25 minutes, place the chopped
almonds in a pie tin or another small ovenproof container and bake
until they turna toasty light brown (10-15 minutes). Check boththe
almonds and the sqash occasionally so you will know when they are
done.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and the thyme.
Saute over low heat until the onions are well done. Add the cooked
barley, tamari, and toasted almonds to the sauteed onions.

Using a small spoon, scoop bite-sized chunks out of the cooked
squash, leaving enough flesh around the shell so that it stays strong
enough to hold its shape. Add the scooped out squash to the barley
mixture. Mix well. Fill the empty squash shells with this mixture,
mounding it as high as possible.

Place the stuffed squash in a baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil
and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.
