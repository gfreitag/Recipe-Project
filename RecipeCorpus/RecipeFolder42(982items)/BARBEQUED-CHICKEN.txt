Title: BARBEQUED CHICKEN
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Split fryer chicken
White vinegar
5 ts Salt
2 ts Dry mustard
2 ts Coarse grind garlic powder
2 ts Cracked black pepper
2 ts MSG
1 ts Crushed thyme
1 ts Celery salt
1/2 ts Dried ground lemon peel
I let the chicken stand in the fridge for a good hour before cooking
on the Weber with a combination of charcoal and hickory (plain tap
water in the drip pan.) I personally thought it was a tad bit on the
salty side, but the family said it was fine. Must have been me. Next
time I might back off some on the plain salt and the garlic powder
and make up the difference with Lawry's (Coarse Ground with Parsley)
Garlic Salt, which I happen to like a lot.
