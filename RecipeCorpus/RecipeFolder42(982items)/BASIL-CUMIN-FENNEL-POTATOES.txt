Title: BASIL-CUMIN-FENNEL POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Potatoes, cooked peeled, and
Cut into 1/2 inch dice
x  A little garlic
x  Equal amounts cumin seeds
And fennel seeds (these
Should add the main
Flavors)
x  Lots of fresh chopped basil
(canned, dried would be
Acceptable)
x  Salt
x  Black pepper
x  Cayenne (optional)
Heat some oil in a pan.  When hot, throw in the cumin and fennel
seeds. After a few seconds, put in the potatoes, along with the salt,
black pepper, and cayenne. Fry the potatoes, stirring occasionally,
until they get crusty.  A minute before serving, add the basil. These
can be eaten plain, or wrapped in a flour tortilla with yogurt, or in
pita bread with yogurt.  If you're combining them with yogurt, the
spices should be a bit heavier, as the yogurt is fairly bland.
