Title: BARBECUE SAUCE - NORINE JUENGER - LENZBURG
Categories: Bar-b-q, Sauces, Pork
Yield: 3 Servings
16 oz Tomato Sauce
2 tb Brown Sugar
1/4 c  Vinegar
2 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1 ts Salt
1 tb Paprika
1 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Chili Powder

1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
salt, paprika, mustard, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Simmer 15
minutes, stirring occasionally.
Serve hot.  Makes 2 1/2 cups. ***** While there was no indication, I
would expect that this is best with Pork, since the idea of 'BBQ' in
that area was nearly always pork.
