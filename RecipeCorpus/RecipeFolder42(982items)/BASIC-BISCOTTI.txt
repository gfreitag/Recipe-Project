Title: BASIC BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies, Italian
Yield: 72 Servings
4 oz Blanched almonds
2 1/2 c  Flour
2 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
3    Eggs
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and toast them
in oven until lightly golden. Let cool. Coarsely chop half the nuts.
Butter 2 large baking sheets. Mix flour, sugar, salt and baking soda.
Beat in eggs, then whole and chopped nuts. Mix to obtain a firm
dough. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 pieces. On a floured
work surface, roll each piece under your hands into a cylinder 15
inches long and about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place 2 rolls, well
separated, on each baking sheet and bake 15 to 20 minutes, until very
lightly browned and firm to the touch. With a spatula, carefully
transfer the rolls to a cutting board and slice each one diagonally
into cookies about 1/2-inch thick. Set wire racks on the baking
sheets and lay out the biscotti on them. Return them to the oven for
20 to 30 minutes, or until very firm and crisp. Cool on the racks,
then transfer them to a tin for long keeping. Try adding 1 1/2-to-2
tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to this recipe for a nice
variation.
