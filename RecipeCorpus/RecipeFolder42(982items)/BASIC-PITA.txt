Title: BASIC PITA
Categories: Bakery, Oriental, Breads
Yield: 24 Small pita
2 c  Warm water
2 tb Yeast
1/2 ts Sugar
2 ts Salt
5 c  White flour
Pour water into a large bowl & add yeast.  Stir & add the sugar &
salt. Gradually add the flour, stirring constantly until the mixture
is smooth. Work in another 1/2 cup of flour with your hands, kneading
as you go, until the dough is no longer sticky.  Knead on a board for
another 5 minutes. Shape dough into a rectangle. Cut it in half,
lengthwise, & divide into 24 portions (or make 12 large pitas).
Shape each portion into a smooth ball & place each ball on a floured
surface. Cover with a damp cloth. Press each ball flat.  With a
rolling pin, roll each round from the centre out turning the dough
1/4 revolution each roll. A small pita should be 5 to 5 1/2" in
diameter & 1/4" thick. (Large ones should be 8" in diameter). Flip
pitas over & smooth out any creases. 15 minutes before loaves have
finished rising, preheat oven to 500F & warm an ungreased baking
sheet. As each loaf is rolled, place it on a floured surface, cover
with a dry clean towel & let rise for 30 to 45 minutes.  Place pitas
on the hot baking sheet. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until
puffed & lightly browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes for small
ones & 3 1/2 for large ones. If desired, flip the pita over to brown
on the other side. Remove from oven, wrap in dry towels until cool
enough to handle. Serve warm or at room temperature.
