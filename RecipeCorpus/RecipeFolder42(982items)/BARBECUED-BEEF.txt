-into 1/8" thick slices
1/4 c  Onions; chopped
1 tb Brown sugar
2 ts Paprika
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Chili powder
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Salt

2 cl Garlic; minced
1 c  Ketchup
1/4 c  Water
1 tb Vegetable oil
1/4 c  Tarragon vinegar

2 dr Liquid smoke
Combine ingredients in slow cooker; cover.  Cook on low for 4 to 6
hours, depending on how well done you want meat. Remove bay leaf
before serving. Serve by itself or on rolls. To save time, use meat
that has been cut up for stir fry. If you're cutting your own, it's
easier if the meat is slightly frozen when you slice it.
