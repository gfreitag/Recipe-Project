Place all ingredients (EXCEPT CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND CHERRIES) into the
inner pan in the order listed, select white bread and push "Start."
Add the chips and cherries when the Auto Bakery "beeps," 88 minutes

fresh, chilled or toasted, this soda fountain special is even more
spectacular when spread with cream cheese blended with minced
maraschinos and their liquid. Shared by Barb Day
