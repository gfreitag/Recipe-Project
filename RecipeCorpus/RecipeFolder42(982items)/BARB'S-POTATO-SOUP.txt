Title: BARB'S POTATO SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------BARB DAY-------------------------------
4 sl Bacon; diced
1 lg Onion; diced (See note)
2 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Cabbage; chopped
12 oz Chicken broth
3 lg Potatoes; peeled, diced
-Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Egg noodles
2 c  Milk
1 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Butter
Note: I like to prepare onion by placing it in a covered vessel and
placing it in the microwave on high, (skin on) for about 5 minutes.
When the onion is done, the skin can be slipped off easily, and the
onion chopped.  This is equivalent to sauteeing to the point where
the onion is translucent, but for this dish the onion still needs to
be sauteed. Using this method cuts out the tears and most of the
odor, not to mention, no use of fat! Cook the bacon in the butter
until it is lightly browned, then add the onion and cook for a few
minutes, until the onion just begins to brown. Add the cabbage, and
cook until it is very limp. Now add the diced potatoes, and chicken
stock. Salt and pepper to taste.
Cover and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender. Add the
noodles on top of the mixture, and cover again. Cook for about 6 to
eight minutes, or until the noodles are almost done.
Add the milk and cream, and the 2 tablespoons of butter, and correct
seasonings. Stir and cover the pan again. Cook over low heat just
until warmed through.
Serving Note:  You might like a little crisp fried, crumbled bacon
and/or chopped chives or green onion tops as a tasty garnish.
