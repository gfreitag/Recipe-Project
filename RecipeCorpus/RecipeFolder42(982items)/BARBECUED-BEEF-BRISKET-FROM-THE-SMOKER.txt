Title: BARBECUED BEEF BRISKET FROM THE SMOKER
Categories: Outdoor, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lb Beef brisket
1/2 c  Barbecue sauce
1/4 c  Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Liquid smoke
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Onion powder
1 ts Fresh cracked black pepper
1/2 ts Celery salt
Trim fat off brisket. Combine barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce and
liquid smoke. Place brisket on center of a large piece of tin foil.
Pour barbecue sauce mixture over both sides of brisket. Combine
remaining ingredients and sprinkle over both sides; wrap brisket
tightly with two more sheets of tin foil turning the wrap 90 degrees
after each wrapping. This will help keep the juices from seeping out.
Refrigerate over night turning over at least once. Remove from
refrigerator at least 2 hours before smoking. Smoke for 5 hours.
