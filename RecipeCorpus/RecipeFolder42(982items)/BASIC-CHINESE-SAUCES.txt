Title: BASIC CHINESE SAUCES
Categories: Chinese, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Water
4 ts Cornstarch
4 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Sesame oil
1 ts Oyster sauce
1 ts Chili paste
Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Stir-fry your
meat first and set aside; then stir-fry your vegetables, return meat
to wok or skillet with the sauce mixture. This recipe would be for
using 1 lb of meat, but I like to double this recipe as we like a lot
of sauce.
