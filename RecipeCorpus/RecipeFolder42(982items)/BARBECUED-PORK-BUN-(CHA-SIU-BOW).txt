Mix together the warm water, 1/2 tsp. sugar and yeast in an 8 oz.
measuring cup.  Let stand until it rises to the 8 oz. level (about 20
minutes).

Sift flour, cake flour, sugar and salt into a large mixing bowl.

Add shortening, yeast mixture and mil,.

Knead mixture 5 minutes to form a dough.  Cover with a damp cloth and
set dough in a warm place.  Allow the dough to rise for 3 hours.

Heat wok, add oil and stir-fry pork for 2 minutes.

Add 2 tablespoons water, salt, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce and
hoisin sauce.  Bring it to a boil.

Prepare thickening by mixing the cornstarch and 4 tablespoons cold
water. Stir into the mixture and cook for 1 minute. Let cool before
using.

After 3 hours, when the dough has risen, shape into rolls about 2
inches in diameter.  Cut each roll into
1-1/2    inch pieces.

Shape each piece into a shallow bowl shape.

Put 1 tablespoon filling in the center, close ans twist dough to form
a bun.  Put the bun on a 2 inch square of white paper. (This prevents
the bun from becoming soggy while steaming.) Place 8 buns in a pie
pan and allow them to set and rest for 15 minutes in a warm place.

Steam for 25 minutes.
