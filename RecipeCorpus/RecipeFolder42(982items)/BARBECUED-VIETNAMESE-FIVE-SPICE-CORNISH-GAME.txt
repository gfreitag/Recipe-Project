4    Cornish game hens (14 ounces
-each)
4    Garlic cloves
2    Shallots, or 3 green onions,
-white part only
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Five spice powder
1 1/2 tb Vietnamese fish sauce
-(nouc mam)
1 1/2 tb Light soy sauce
1 1/2 tb Dry sherry
This aromatic barbecued game hen can be easily served West- ern style
with rice, cole slaw or a green salad. [But it would be better with
Thai cucumber salad or Vietnamese carrot salad. Mmmm... S.C.] Halve
the hens through the breast. Flatten with the palm of your hand. In a
mortar or food processor, pound or mince garlic, shallots and sugar.
Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Pour mixture over hens;
marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight in refrigerator. Set hens,
skin-side down, on grill and barbecue over medium coals for 15
minutes. Turn and barbecue 15 minutes longer or until they are
thoroughly cooked. Serve with Nuoc Cham dipping sauce.
