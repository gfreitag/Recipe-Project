1 1/2 c  Warm water (105-115^)
1/3 c  Butter
4 c  Unbleached flour
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
2 tb Pesto
2 cl Garlic, minced

Combine yeast and warm water in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup; let
stand 5 minutes.

Combine yeast mixture, butter, 2 cups flour, and next 3 ingredients
in a large mixing bowl; beat at medium speed of an electric mixer
until well blended. Stir in pesto and garlic. Gradually stir in
enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. (Dough will be sticky.)

hour or until doubled in size.

Stir dough; spoon into greased muffin pans, filling half full. Cover
and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 45 minutes.

melted butter, if desired.
