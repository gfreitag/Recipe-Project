Title: BASIC BREAD MACHINE RECIPE
Categories: Breads, Low-fat, Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Loaf
2 3/4 ts Yeast
1 ts Malt
11 oz Water (110 - 120 deg.F)
3 c  Whole Wheat flour
1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
2 tb Sugar, honey, molasses...
1 ts Salt
2 tb Gluten
put yeast and malt into machine with several oz. of water. Use a
thermometer for the water. Too hot will kill the yeast. The yeast
will now proof (start to multiply) In a separate bowl, measure out
all dry ingredients and mix. After a few minutes, yeast should be
bubbling, add dry stuff and any liquids including the water. start
the machine and see how it looks. If too dry, add until it looks
right. Should be one big mass not several. Flour:  I often substitute
1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of gluten for a cup of WW flour.
For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar (I commonly use honey,
molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins. 3 T of carroway seeds
or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great. I have also added 2
mashed bananas, then cut the water.
