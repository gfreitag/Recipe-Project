See recipe: Basic White Bread by James Beard, for instructions on
kneading. That is a "real" load of bread!
:-) * Instructions * Proof the yeast in the water in a large mixing
bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the dry milk, sugar,
butter, salt, optional garlic, and 2 cups flour. Beat the batter by
hand or with an electric mixer at medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in
the remaining flour by hand and stir the mixture well to make a soft
dough. Cover it with a damp towel and let it rise in a warm,
draft-free place for about 40 minutes or until it is double in bulk.
Preheat the oven to 375dF. Uncover the risen dough and stir it
vigorously for 1 minute. Butter a 1-1/2 quart straight-sided
casserole or souffle' dish and put in the batter. Brush the top with
the egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake the bread in the
center of the oven for about 1 hour, or until it is delicately
browned and sounds hollow when rapped with the knuckles. Remove from
the casserole dish and serve warm, cut into wedges.
