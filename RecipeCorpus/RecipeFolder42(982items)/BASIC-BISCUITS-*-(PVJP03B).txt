Nathalie Dupree's Matter of Taste Cookbook and they are really good
and easy too! Preheat oven to 450 to 500 degrees. Sift 2 cups of
flour with the baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut in the
shortening with a pastry blender or fork, or work in with your
fingers. Add the milk to make a soft dough, mixing just until the
dough holds together. Flour your hands. Pull off a piece of dough the
size of a biscuit and dip the wet edge into extra flour. Then roll or
pat into a biscuit shape. Place the biscuits, slightly touching, on a
lightly greased baking sheet. Bake until golden brown 8 to 10 min.
Makes 12-18 biscuits. FROM: SHERYL JEFFRIES (PVJP03B)
