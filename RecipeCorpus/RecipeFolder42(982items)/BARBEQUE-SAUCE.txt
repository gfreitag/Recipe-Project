Title: BARBEQUE SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Bar-b-q
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Catsup
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
1/3 c  Water
1/4 c  Butter
1 tb Paprika
1 ts Brown Sugar; packed
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
Heat all ingredients except lemon juice and worcestershire sauce.
Bring to a boil.  Add lemon juice and worcestershire sauce and heat
until hot. Makes about 2 cups.  [Variations I make: 1 Can Tomato
sauce + 2 T. sugar. Slightly less butter, or none at all. The chicken
seems to produce enough of it's own fat to make up for leaving any
out. 1/2 T. packed brown sugar.] Pour over Skinned and cleaned
Chicken. Cook in crockpot for about 6-8 hours on low. 4-6 hours on
high. ______
