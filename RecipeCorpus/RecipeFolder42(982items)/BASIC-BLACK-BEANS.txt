2 ts Ground cumin
1 ea Green pepper, quartered
1/2 ea Onion, finely chopped

Rinse beans and discard any stones. In a large pot, soak beans
overnight in water with baking soda, oregano, cumin and green pepper.
The next day, add onion, garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, sherry and

until the beans are very tender and liquid is reduced and somewhat
thickened. Make sure liquid in pot does not entirely boil away.  To
prevent beans from burning, add more water when necessary.
