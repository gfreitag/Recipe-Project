Title: ABOBONG MANOK (CHICKEN ADOBO)
Categories: Chicken, Phillipines, Submitted
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Chicken pieces
1/2 c  Soy Sauce
3/4 c  Vinegar, white
1 ea Garlic head
2 ea Bay Leaves
1/2 tb Peppercorns
Salt; to taste
Boil Chicken with soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves and
peppercorns and simmer for half an hour. Remove the chicken pieces
from the pot and broil them in a pan for 10 minutes. Let the sauce in
the pot boil until it is reduced by half. Add salt to taste. Cover
the broiled chicken pieces with the sauce. Serve hot.
Serve with rice. Note: I find this dish doesn't need any salt as
the soy sauce is salty enough. I also remove the chicken skins. Mark
