The process is simple. Initially, the boiling procedure may seem
strange, but once you've done it, you'll wonder why you hesitated.
Just boil a pot of water as you would for spaghetti, and boil the
shaped bagel for about 2 minutes, turning once. Your first few bagels
may not come out round and smooth on top, but they'll taste good
anyway. Be patient. The second batch will look better; by the third,
you mat think you're ready to go into business.

Basically, these are the basic steps required to make bagels. We'll
go into each in detail.

1. Mix, knead and first rise: Mix flour, water, salt, sugar (or malt
or honey) and yeast, knead them and let the dough rise for about an
hour. Mixing and kneading can be done in a bread machine, a food
processor, a heavy duty mixer, or by hand. this same procedure is
used to make any yeast bread.

2. Shape bagels: Form the dough into the traditional bagel shape by
rolling, poking a hole in a ball or using a bagel cutter.

3. Second rise: Allow a short rest and second rise period, about 20
minutes.

4. Boil or "kettle": Drop the bagels into boiling water for 1 to 3
minutes and drain. You can bake immediately or refrigerate for 1 to
24    hours.

5. Glaze and apply topping: This step is not essential to the final
product.

6. Bake: Bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 35 minutes.
