Title: ALSATIAN GRATIN OF ROOTS (LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 10 Servings
3 lg Onions finely chopped
4 lg Carrots (1 lb) chopped
3 c  Broth chicken, beef, or
Vegetable
3 lb Potatoes (about 6large)
1 lb (2 medium) rutabagas
1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley
1 ea Nutmeg to taste
3/4 c  Jarlsberg cheese (I used ff
Cheese instead)
In a 5-6 quart pan (I used a small roaster) cook onions and carrots
in 1/2 cup of broth until softened. Add to this the parsley.

Peel and thinly slice the potatoes and rutabagas. Arrange half of the
potato/rutabaga combo in the bottom of the pan (I sprayed with Pam
first). Top with half the onion/carrot mixture. Repeat with the other
half of the ingredients.  Over the top, pour the rest of the broth.

Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours in a 425 degree oven. Top with cheese
and sprinkle with nutmeg.  Broil until cheese is browned.

Makes 10-12 servings

Comment: I wanted to share a recipe which I have been making this
winter for my family.  It is a good cold weather dish. It makes
enough for a crowd ~ my family (2 adults and 3 teens) only eat about
half. This can be made ahead and chilled until ready to use.
