1/2 ts Salt

1/4 ts Ground black pepper
1/4 ts Onion powder

Cut the potatoes into 1" cubes.  Add to boiling salted water. Cook

Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the salt, peppers, onion and garlic
power, cumin and cayenne pepper.  Add the potatoes to the spices.
Toss to coat all pieces evenly.  You may do this much in advance and
hold the potatoes as long as an hour before completing the dish. Heat

piece of potato sizzles when added to the oil. Add the potatoes. Fry
until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently. Remove from fat,
drain and serve immediately.
