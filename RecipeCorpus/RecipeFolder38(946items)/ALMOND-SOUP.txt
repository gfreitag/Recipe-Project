F.&R.Dahl: "This delicate soup, popular 100 years ago, is now
unusual. On no account should it be liquidized at any stage, as that
ruins the texture"

Mince the almonds and, using a pestle and mortar, reduce to a paste
with the egg yolks and a little stock, to stop them oiling.

Bring the stock up to simmering point in a saucepan and whisk in the
beurre manie. When that has dissolved, whisk in the almond paste.

Cook gently for 30 minutes.

Strain through a sieve, add the cream, season with salt and pepper,
heat gently and serve.
