Title: ALPHA'S PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  Sugar
5 oz Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Butter
1 tb Light corn syrup
18 oz Peanut butter
1 ts Vanilla
In a medium saucepan, dissolve sugar in evaporated milk. Add butter
(cut in pieces) and corn syrup, and, stirring constantly, cook over
low heat until butter is melted. Continue cooking, stirring
frequently, to soft ball stage. Remove from heat and mix in peanut
butter. Cool to about 120 degrees F and mix in vanilla. Spread in
suitable size pan (the larger the pan, the thinner each piece of
candy will be; I use a 8x8 pan). Fudge will still be very soft at
this stage; it takes a few hours to set up.
