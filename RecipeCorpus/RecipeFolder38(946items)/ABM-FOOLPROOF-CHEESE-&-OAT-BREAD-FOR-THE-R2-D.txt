Title: ABM FOOLPROOF CHEESE & OAT BREAD FOR THE R2 D
Categories: Breads
Yield: 20 Servings
1/2 tb Yeast
2 1/2 c  Flour, bread
1 c  Oats
1/4 c  Milk, powdered
1/2 tb Salt
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Oil
1    Eggs
1 c  Water; warm
1 c  Cheese, shredded
Sharp cheddar cheese is recommended.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" to 11 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot, humid weather, use 1/8 c less water; also in very cold
weather.

Tested in DAK 1-1/2 lb R2D2 bread machine.  Sylvia's comment: a
hearty, easy-to-slice bread, surprisingly good for sandwiches. I even
used powdered buttermilk when I ran out of powdered milk with good
results.
