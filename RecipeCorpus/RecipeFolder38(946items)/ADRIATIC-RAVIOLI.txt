Put a large pot of water on to boil. Snap off and discard the tough
asparagus ends, and cut the stalks into 1-inch pieces. You will have
about 3 cups of asparagus. Steam until barely tender, 6 to 8 minutes,
and set aside.

Begin cooking the ravioli, stirring occasionally.

Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute'
the red pepper, mushrooms, and garlic until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat.

Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large, heavy saucepan
over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, and let it cook for a minute or
two. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly until thickened,
about 3 to 5 minutes.

Add the salt, paprika, mustard, basil, Romano cheese, and pepper to
taste stirring until the cheese is melted. Reduce the heat to very
low, and stir in the sauteed vegetables.

When the ravioli is tender and begins to float , after about 10 to 12
minutes, drain it well, and transfer it to a large serving bowl.

Pour on the sauce, and toss gently.  Garnish with paprika, and serve
with Parmesan on the side.

Tender ravioli, asparagus, and mushrooms tossed with a Dijon and basil
cheese sauce make for this elegant entree, named for Italy's beautiful
Adriatic coast. 4 servings
