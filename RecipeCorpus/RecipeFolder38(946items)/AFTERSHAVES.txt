The tangy tingling sensation it causes after being splashed on is one
way to describe an aftershave. Most aftershaves act as astringents;
they help firm skin tone and close skin pores when applied
immediately after shaving. Many aftershaves contain alcohol, which
possesses antibacterial abilities, helping to prevent infections of
knicks or shaving cuts. It also should contain glycerine and/or other
ingredients known to be beneficial to skin care. Glycerine will help
counter the drying effects on the skin, and the chafing and
irritation that can develop with dry skin. *Most drug stores contain
all of the above tinctures and oils. Herb and health food shops carry
the essential oils.
