Blueberries freeze very well.  Simply sort the fruit, don't wash, and
pack in freezer bags or boxes. When you use the frozen fruit, simply
wash in running water and use. Don't thaw. This is especially nice
when adding blueberries to fruit salad or muffins where you don't
want the rest of the product to turn purple. If you've already washed
the berries, let them dry before freezing. My favorite way to eat
blueberries is "straight up." For breakfast try the berries in rice
(brown, white, what ever) with a little cinnamon and/or clove.
