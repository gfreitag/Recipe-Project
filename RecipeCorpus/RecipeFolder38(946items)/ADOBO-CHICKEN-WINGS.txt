Title: ADOBO CHICKEN WINGS
Categories: Chicken, Phillipines
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Soy sauce
3/4 c  Vinegar
1 ea Whole head of garlic, peel
-and crush cloves
1-2 bay leaves
5 ea Peppercorns
2 tb Brown sugar
3 lb Of chicken wings
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix everything but the wings together.
Place wings in large pan, layering is okay, but make sure that the
pan is large enough to hold the wings and sauce. Pour sauce over the
wings, and bake until wings are done and golden brown.  Stir
occasionally. Typically, Adobo is done with a whole chicken, and
simmered stove top and served with white rice.  It's fairly flexible,
some folks will broil the chicken after simmering to crisp it up a
little, and reduce the sauce a bit. Others will add a cup or two of
water during the simmering process. Some add brown sugar for a little
sweetness, and/or cayenne to spice it up a bit. Adobo Chicken Wings
