[Saffron gives this dish its traditional Paella coloring. It is
however, expensive. Turmeric can be used as a substitute.]

Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the garlic, onion and leek for 5
minutes. Stir in the rice, prawns, mussels, salmon juice, stock, lemon
juice and saffron. Mix well, bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and
simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the liquid is almost completely
absorbed by the rice.

Stir the tomatoes into the rice along with the salmon, broken into
large flakes.

slices. Serve immediately.
