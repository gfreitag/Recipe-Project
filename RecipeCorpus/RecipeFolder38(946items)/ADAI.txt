Categories: Vegetarian, Indian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Rice
1/3 c  Urad dal
1/3 c  Chana dal
1/3 c  Yellow split peas
1 ts Salt
1 ts Red chili powder
1 lg Onion (opt)
1    Carrot (opt)
1/4 c  Coconut, grated (opt)
Mix rice, chana dal, urad dal, and yellow split peas in a large
vessel. Soak in a lot of water for about 2 hours.

Grind the soaked mixture with chili powder and salt coarsely, without
adding much water.

Ferment for about 3 - 4 hours, then refrigerate or freeze. In cold
weather, the fermenting process might take longer, and it might be a
good idea to ferment in an oven (the pilot light will keep the
mixture warm).

Add either onions (finely cut), carrot (grated) or coconut before
preparing.

Freezing Notes

If freezing, only ferment for about an hour.  The mixture will have
to be left out for a while before being ready to use.
