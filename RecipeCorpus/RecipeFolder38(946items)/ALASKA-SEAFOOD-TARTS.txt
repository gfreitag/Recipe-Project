Title: ALASKA SEAFOOD TARTS
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
418 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
350 g  Packet filo pastry
3 tb Walnut oil
15 g  Margarine
25 g  Plain flour
2 tb Greek yogurt
175 g  Seafood sticks; chopped
-(crab flavored)
25 g  Walnuts, chopped
100 g  Grated Parmesan
-OR- grated Cheddar cheese
Pre-heat oven to 80 C, 350 F, Gas mark 4. Lightly grease 8 individual
pie dishes or ovenproof pudding bowls.

Drain the can of salmon and make the juice up to 200ml / 7fl.oz. with
water for fish stock. Flake the salmon. Set aside.

Brush each individual sheet of filo pastry with oil and fold into
sixteen 12.5cm / 5inch squares. Put one square into each pie dish
leaving the pointed corners protruding over the edge. Brush with oil
then put a second square of pastry onto the first, but with the
corners pointing up in between the original ones to create a water
lily effect. Brush the points well with oil then bake for 5 minutes
to set but not brown. Take out of the oven.

Reduce the oven temperature to 150 C, 300 F, Gas mark 2. Melt the
margarine and stir in the flour. Blend in the fish stock, beating
well to remove lumps. Stir the yogurt, seafood sticks, walnuts and
flaked salmon into the sauce and divide equally between the 8 pastry
cases.

Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top then return to the oven to heat
through for 5-8 minutes or until the cheese and pastry have turned
golden brown. Serve immediately.
