Title: AEBLESKIVERS
Categories: Pastry, Danish
Yield: 1 Batch
3    Egg; separated
2 c  Buttermilk
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Cardamom
Beat yolks of eggs with buttermilk.

Mix together sugar, salt, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and
cardamom.

Beat egg whites until stiff.

Mix egg yolk-buttermilk mixture with dry ingredients. Add egg whites,
carefully folding them in so that they don't break down.

Heat aebleskive pan. Put 1 tsp salad oil in each hole and fill
completely with batter. Let bake until slightly crusty on bottom.
Turn slightly with a knitting needle or skewer. Continue cooking,
turning the ball to keep it from burning, until the knitting needle
comes out clean when stuck in the center.

Serve aebleskive hot with powdered sugar, jam, and jelly.

Notes included with recipe: For those of you who are unfamiliar with
aebleskive, it is a baked delight made with a pancake-like batter,
cooked in a special pan that turns the aebleskive into a crusty ball,
and is known as the "Danish Doughnut." As you can tell, it is a
little difficult to give aebleskive an easy definition other than to
tell you that it is good enough to go ahead and order the pans if you
are likely to serve breakfasts and brunches to family and friends.

Aebleskive pans are available through most gourmet cookware shops or
can be ordered from Pea Soup Andersen's Santa Ynez Valley Wine Center,
