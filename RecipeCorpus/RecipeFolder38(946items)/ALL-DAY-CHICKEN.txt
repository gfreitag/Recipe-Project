Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Frozen OJ
2 c  Chicken stock
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Tomato paste
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Brown sugar
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 ds Allspice
Remaining ingredients:
4 lb Chicken, breasts and thighs
1/4 lb Mushrooms, sliced
2 tb Margarine or butter
11 oz (1 can) mandarin orange
Sections, drained
1/2    Of a medium-large bell
Pepper, sliced lengthwise
1/4 ts Ground ginger
3 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Cold milk
1/4 c  Cold water
Marinade:

The night before you plan on slow cooking your dinner, mix together
the marinade ingredients in a large, closable container large enough
to also hold the chicken pieces. When marinade is thoroughly mixed,
add the chicken, close container and refrigerate until morning.

In the morning place the chicken in the slow cooker and add marinade
up to about an inch from the top of the container. Set the cooker on
low and cover.

6 to 8 hours later, turn the cooker to high.  About an hour later,
saute the sliced mushrooms in the margarine or butter. Then add the
mushrooms (with pan juices), mandarin sections, green pepper and
ginger into the slow cooker and stir thoroughly. Mix together the
cornstarch, milk and cold water, then gradually add into the slow
cooker while stirring until the entire mixture thickens a bit.

Re-cover the slow cooker and let simmer for 15 to 30 minutes until
serving. Serve with baby carrots and small new potatoes.
