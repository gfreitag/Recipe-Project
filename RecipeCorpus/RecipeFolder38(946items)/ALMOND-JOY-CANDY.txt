Title: ALMOND JOY CANDY
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Condensed milk; sweetened
-14 oz
2 oz Chocolate; unsweetened
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
3 c  Coconut; shredded
45    Almonds; whole, salted
Preheat oven to 350F. In top of double boiler, combine condensed milk,
chocolate and salt. Cook over rapidly boiling water; stirring often,
for 5 to 7 minutes, or till until mixture thickens. Remove from heat
and stir in vanilla and coconut. Form cookies by dropping teaspoons
of mixture on well greased baking sheet, 1" apart. Top each with a
whole almond. Bake on middle sheet of oven for 10-12 minutes,
watching cookies carefully after 8-9 minutes,as the bottom can get
too brown. Immediately remove cookies from pan with metal spatula and
cool on wax peper covered rack.

These taste a bit like the chocolate bars; hence the name. They freeze
well. from _Heartland: The Best of the Old and the New from Midwest
