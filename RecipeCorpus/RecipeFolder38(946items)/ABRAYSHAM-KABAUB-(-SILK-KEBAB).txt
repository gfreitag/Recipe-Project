Title: ABRAYSHAM KABAUB ( SILK KEBAB)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 30 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Water
1 ts Lemon juice
1/4 ts Saffron threads (optional)
MMMMM---------------------------OMELET--------------------------------
8    Eggs
1 pn Salt
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
2 c  Oil
3/4 c  Finely chopped pistachios *
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
*Note: Instead of pistachio nuts, walnuts may be used if desired.
Dissolve sugar in water in heavy pan over medium heat. Bring to the
boil, add lemon juice and saffron and boil for 10 minutes. Cool and
strain into a 25 cm (10 inch) pie plate.  Keep aside. Break eggs into
a casserole dish about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. The size and
flat base are important. Add salt and mix eggs with fork until yolks
and whites are thoroughly combined - do not beat as eggs must not be
foamy. Heat oil in an electric frypan to 190 C (375 F) or in a 25 cm
(10 inch) frypan placed on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or
burner. Have ready nearby a long skewer, the plate of syrup, a baking
sheet and the nuts mixed with the cardamom. A bowl of water and a
cloth for drying hands are also necessary. Hold dish with eggs in one
hand next to the pan of oil and slightly above it. Put hand into egg,
palm down, so that egg covers back of hand. Lift out hand, curling
fingers slightly inwards, then open out over hot oil, fingers
pointing down.  Move hand across surface of oil so that egg falls in
streams from fingertips.  Dip hand in egg again and make more strands
across those already in pan.  Repeat 3 to 4 times until about an
eighth of the egg is used.  There should be a closely meshed layer of
egg strands about 20 cm (8 inches) across.  Work quickly so that the
last lot of egg is added not long after the first lot. Rinse hands
quickly and dry. Take skewer and slide under bubbling omelet, lift up
and turn over to lightly brown other side. The first side will be
bubbly, the underside somewhat smoother. When golden brown lift out
with skewer and drain over pan. Place omelet flat in the syrup, spoon
syrup over the top and lift out with skewer onto baking sheet. Roll
up with bubbly side inwards. Finish roll should be about 3 cm (1 1/4
inches) in diameter.  Put to one side and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat
with remaining egg, making 7 to 8 rolls in all. Though depth of egg
diminishes, you will become so adept that somehow you will get it in
the pan in fine strands. When cool, cut kabaubs into 4-5 cm (1 1/2 to
2 inch pieces and serve. These keep well in a sealed container in a
cool place.
