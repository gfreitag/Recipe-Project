Here's a seasoning blend used to make Blackened Salmon steaks:

Mix this up well, and then dip the fish fillets first in melted
butter, then smear the seasoning mixture on both sides of the fish.
Heat a cast iron skillet for about eight minutes onhigh heat. Put the
fillets in the pan without crowding, pour a few tablespoons of melted
butter on top, cook on both sides for about two minutes and serve
immediately with butter and lemon.
