Title: AIKEN COUNTY CORN BREAD DRESSING
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  White corn meal
1 c  Flour
2 c  Milk
2 tb Shortening
2 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1    Onion
2    Eggs
Pepper to taste

Make a batter of the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, shortening
(the oil from the baking fowl is generally used) and milk. Bake in a
hot oven (400) until done, about half an hour. Then crumble the
bread, add one medium sized onion, chopped fine, pepper and a little
more salt. Break in the two eggs and wet with the juice from the
baking chicken or turkey. The liver chopped fine and added to the
dressing improves it, as does the addition of hard cooked egg. After
mixing thoroughly, put the mixture on one side of the baking dish and
roast with the fowl until brown. When basting the fowl, baste the
dressing also to keep it moist and to improve the flavor. This amount
will serve 12 persons.
