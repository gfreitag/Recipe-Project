1. Combine the flour, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and cinnamon
in a large bowl.  Add the beef cubes and toss with a fork to coat. 2.
Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Brown the
beef, in batches, on all sides.  Return the beef to the pot. Add the
beef broth and apple juice.  Cover and simmer over medium heat until
the meat is tender, about 1 hour. 3. Add the potatoes, bell peppers,
