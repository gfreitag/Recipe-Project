2 c  White wine -- dry
6 c  Tomato sauce

Make a dark roux with olive oil and flour.  When roux is dark brown,
add onion, green onion, bell pepper, and celery; cover and cook until
onions are clear, stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes and continue
cooning for 10 min; stir often. Add water and stir to make a thick
liquid. Add garlic, Worcestershire, lemon juice, salt, hot sauce,
wine, and tomato sauce, making sure to mix well. Add alligator, and
enough water to cover the ingredients by 2 inches; stir to mix. Bring
to a boil, stirring frequently. After it comes to a boil, turn heat
to low and cover, checking from time to time, and stir to prevent
sauce from sticking. Continue cooking for 3 to 4 hrs. until meat is
tender. Serve over cooked rice or spaghetti with Parmesan cheese.
Freeze leftovers in serving size containers.

This recipe is for a party--no one would go to this much trouble if
the recipe only fed 4 peoples.
