The root beer you'll make here is a simplified version of Roy Allen's
method from the early 1900's.  Instead of harvesting roots, herbs, and
berries, you have the luxury of using a root beer concentrate that
can be found in most grocery stores. In 1922 Allen expanded his
business, he formed a partnership with entrepreneur Frank Wright.
This led to the name that would become famous, A&W, the country's
best-selling root beer.
