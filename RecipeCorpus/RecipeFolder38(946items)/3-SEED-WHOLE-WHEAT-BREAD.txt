Title: 3-SEED WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
Categories: Breads, Abm
Yield: 1 Loaf
2 ts Dry yeast
2 tb Sunflower seeds
2 tb Sesame seeds
2 tb Poppy seeds
1/2 c  Rolled oats
1 ts Salt
2 c  Whole wheat flour
3 tb Olive oil
2 tb Honey
1 c  Warm water
This will make a 1 1/2 lb loaf.  Use the whole wheat setting on your
machine.  We love this bread, but I'm not a big fan of all whole
wheat, so I usually use 1 1/2 cups of BREAD flour and just 1/2 cup
Whole wheat.
