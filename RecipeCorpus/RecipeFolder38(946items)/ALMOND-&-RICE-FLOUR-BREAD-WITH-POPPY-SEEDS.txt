Title: ALMOND & RICE FLOUR BREAD WITH POPPY SEEDS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Whole almonds, with skins
1 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
3 ts Poppy seeds
1/2 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
1/2 c  Water
1 lg Whole egg
1 lg Egg white white
2 tb Vegetable oil
This and the following two recipes are wheat free, utilizing brown
rice flour.  They're from an article by Jacqueline Mallorca in the
Chron. For those to whom it is important, she's working on a book
about wheat-free baking.  No hint as to the release date though.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan.

Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and
grind until a fine meal is formed++the flour will prevent the nuts
from turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt
and 2 teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly.

Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2-cup
measuring cup.

With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed
tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix.

Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Sprinkle with remaining poppy
seeds, and bake for 55 minutes.  Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread
slices best after several hours, or the next day).

Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).
