Check the state of origin on the bag to see if you have Michigan
boilers or an off brand Idaho baker. For boiling, I like Michigan
(plain old brown potatoes), red (thin skinned), and Yukon Golds - and
those lovely new red potatoes in the spring!  For baking, Idaho or
russets. For mashing, russets. I know there are lots of neat
varieties out there that I haven't seen, please let us all know about
them!
