Title: ABSOLUTELY APRICOT
Categories: Abm, Fruits, Misc
Yield: 1 Loaf
3 ts Yeast; (active dry)
3 c  Bread Flour
2 tb Dry milk
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Apricot Jam
3/4 c  Dried Apricots; chopped
1 1/4 c  -Water
If your machine offers the option, use the "light crust" setting as
the crust browns more due to the sugar content of the jam. Try to use
a jam with a high fruit content & few additives. This recipe can be
baked on the regular, rapid bake, or timed settings. I have a DAK
Turbo II & baked it on the reg setting.  It was one of the few loaves
that have turned out really well lately...think my DAK is dying; just
today ordered a ZOJI from Irwin. The bread kept VERY well in a
Rubbermaid container...was nice & fresh for a whole week (I forgot
about the last couple of slices!). I even made it when MY
mother-in-law came to visit & she LOVED it! Hope it turns out good
for you.
