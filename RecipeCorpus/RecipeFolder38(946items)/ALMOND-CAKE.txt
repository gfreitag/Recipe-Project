FOR THE PASTRY: Combine pastry ingredients by hand or in a food
processor to form a soft dough. Do not overmix. Chill for 30 minutes.
Roll out and line an 11-or-12-inch pie or tart pan. Prick the base
and chill for 15-to-20 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F. FOR THE
FILLING: Heat 1/3 of the butter in a saute pan, add the chopped
almonds and saute over medium heat until browned. Cool. Melt the
remaining butter in a small saucepan. Cool. Mix the ground almonds
and sugar in a bowl and add the eggs one by one, beating after each
addition until the mixture is light and thick. Sift the potato or
corn starch with the baking powder and salt and fold into the almond
mixture. Fold in the melted butter. Do not overmix. Pour the mixture
into the tart shell and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the batter
begins to set. Quickly scatter the chopped almonds over the top in
one even layer. Return the tart to the oven and continue baking for
17-to-20 minutes or until the pastry is brown and the filling is firm.
