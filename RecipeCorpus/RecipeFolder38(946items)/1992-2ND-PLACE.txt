Title: 1992 2ND PLACE: PECAN TASSIES
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 c  Butter, softened
3 oz Cream cheese, softened
1 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 ea Egg
3/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
1 tb Butter, melted
Pinch salt
3/4 c  Chopped pecans
Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 25 minutes

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ready 2 miniature muffin tins with
cups that measure about 2 inches across and 7/8 inch deep.

2. For crust, beat butter with cream cheese until smooth. Add flour
and mix until a dough forms. Divide into 24 balls. With your fingers,
press each ball into an ungreased muffin cup, taking care to make a
smooth, even layer over the bottom and up the sides.

3. For filling, whisk egg in a medium bowl. Add sugar, butter and
salt and mix well.

4. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon chopped pecans into each crust. Add
filling so it comes almost to the top of the cups, making sure it
doesn't spill over. Sprinkle remaining pecans over the top.

5. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 250 degrees and continue to bake
until crust is light brown at the edges, 10 minutes. Cool. When
muffin tin is cool enough to handle, loosen cups from the sides of
the tin and carefully transfer to a wire rack. Cool to room
temperature.
