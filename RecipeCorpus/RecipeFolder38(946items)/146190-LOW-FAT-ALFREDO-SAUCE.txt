Title: 146190 LOW FAT ALFREDO SAUCE
Categories: Low fat, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Evaporated skim milk
6 oz Parmesan cheese, low fat
-Pepper to taste
Warm milk, add cheese until melted and thickened.  Add pepper. I
usually add a medium white sauce to make more and lighten the taste.
Also, crab meat, broccoli, spinach, mushrooms can be added; mixed or
separately. Have fun with it and pour over pasta.  (White sauce is
also good made with evaporated skim milk.)
