Corn/maize was introduced to Africa from Latin America by the
Portuguese, mainly to provision their slave ships.  The grain was
quickly accepted because it grew rapidly and undemanding in
cultivation. The name 'maize' comes from 'mahiz', the word used by
the Caribbean Taino Indians from whom the Europeans probably first
learned about the crop. in North American the English settlers were
shown it by local Indians. 'Corn' was a general name given to any
grain, so they called it simply 'Indian corn'.

Columbus noted that maize was "most tasty boiled, roasted or ground
into flour".  And in southern Ghana today a common food is 'kenkey',
fermented corn/maize flour balls, wrapped in corn/maize leaves and
steamed. Akpith, this recipe, is more straightforward.

In a large saucepan, boil the water and then

in half of the corn/maize meal and all the soy flour to make a thick
porridge. Add the baking powder, chili powder if using and sugar;
season.

Cook this for 10 minutes over a low heat, stirring constantly.  Then
remove the pan and set aside to cool for 10 minutes or so.

At this point, mix in the remaining corn/maize meal and combine
thoroughly, adding water to produce a stiff dough.

Now pour enough oil into a pan or wok to give a depth of around 2
inches (5 cms), and heat up.  While it is warming mould the dough
into balls about 1 inch (2.5 cms) in diameter.

With the oil sizzling hot, slide 4 or 5 balls carefully into the pan
and cook for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown.
