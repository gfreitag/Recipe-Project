floured wax paper to 1/8 -inch thickness. Cut out with cookie
cutters. Return dough to refrigerator if it gets too soft. Transfer

This second-place winner, from Judy M. Drux of Dyer, Indiana, makes
very thin, crisp, delicate cookies. The dough keeps well in the
refrigerator if well-wrapped. This cookie was a tribute to her
husband's grandmother, Antonia Drux, who emigrated to this country
from Germany in 1923. (Oma means "grandma" in German.) The recipe has
been passed down as just a list of ingredients. Drux added a few
hints to help make baking them easier for future cooks. from the
