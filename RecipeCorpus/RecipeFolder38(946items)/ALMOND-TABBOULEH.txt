2/3 c  Chopped natural almonds
1 c  Bulgur(cracked wheat)
1 c  Quartered cherry tomatoes
OR a 1/2 c raisins
2/3 c  Sliced green onions
1/2 c  Lightly packed chopped
Parsley
2 tb Chopped fresh mint
1/3 c  Lime or lemon juice
1/4 c  Almond or other polyunsaturd
Oil
1/4 ts Pepper
Spread almonds in a shallow pan. Toast in a moderate oven (350F) 10
minutes, or until lightly browned, stirring once or twice while
toasting; cool. Place bulgur in large bowl. Pour boiling water over
to just cover. Let stand until water is absorbed. Add cherry tomatoes
or raisins, green onions,parsley, mint, lime or lemon juice, oil and
pepper. Toss until mixed. Cover and chill. I thought this was a
really nice twist, but then I love almonds. Have a great day, great
lady!! Hugs, Pam
