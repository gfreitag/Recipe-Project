** For a quick fix for a stubborn odor, here's a traditional solution
that you can customize to your taste.

Into a clean gallon size plastic jug pour baking soda, ammonia, and
the scent of your choice. Slowly fill with warm water. Label and cap
jug. Keep out of the reach of children. Pour small quantities of the
solution into pretty containers with spray tops--old perfune
containers or atomizers are ideal. Then you can leave the refresher
on the counter in rooms where you need it frequently.

To Use: Simply mist the air where unpleasant odors abound. Avoid
spraying on or near furniture or pets. Wipe up any reside if you
overdo, but the mist will not harm anything if you don't soak an item
with the mist. Especially AVOID spraying directly on FINE WOOD
FURNITURE--The ammonia, scent, or water could harm the finish. 1 gal.

Big savings.
