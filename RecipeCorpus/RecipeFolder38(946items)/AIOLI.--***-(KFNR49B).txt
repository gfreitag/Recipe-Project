I find a recipe in my Encyclopedia of Cooking by JoAnna Morris for
aioli. Here it is: Remove the crusts from bread and soak in milk.
Squeeze dry. Place in large mortar with garlic & mash with pestle
until a fine paste.  Add the yolks & salt & mash in. Drop by drop
pound in olive oil.  When the sauce becomes thick; the remaining oil
may be beaten in. Thin with water & lemon juice to taste. FROM: PAM
