Ann Smith of Plainfield won second place, and described how her
gingerbread men left Bohemia in 1872 and immigrated to the United
States. Smith's great-grandmother, "Babicka" Novak, lived in a small
Czech-American town in South Dakota where Smith's mother grew up in
the 1920s. At Christmas time, her great-grandma would give her
neighbors Old World gingerbread men, reindeer and rocking horses.
"One year when Great-grandma delivered the cookies, she brought
along her teenaged grandson, who was visiting from a small ethnic
Czech community in Nebraska," Smith wrote.
"Introductions made that day over the watchful eyes of the
gingerbread men eventually lead to wedding bells for my parents a
decade later. Great-grandma Novak probably had planned this all
along!" from the Chicago Tribune second annual Food Guide Holiday
Cookie Contest December 14, 1989
