Title: ALL-AMERICAN COLE SLAW
Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Green cabbage; quartered,
-   cored, and shredded fine
3 tb Vinegar; cider, malt, distld
2/3 c  Mayonnaise
1    Onion, small; grated (optnl)
2    Carrot, medium; grated
1/4 ts Salt
In a large mixing bowl, toss the cabbage with the vinegar and salt.
Grate the carrots and optional onion directly into the bowl. Add the
mayonnaise and toss well.
The slaw can be served immediately, but it is much better -- more
melded and tender -- if allowed to stand and tossed occasionally for
30 minutes to 1 hour. For a very limp slaw, refrigerate several hours
or overnight.

^^^^^^^^^^
The law on cole slaw is cabbage and vinegar.  All the rest is
interpretation.  Adjust the recipe to taste: Add more mayonnaise,
substitute sour cream or yogurt for some (but not all) of the
mayonnaise, or add a supplement of one or the other. Add diced green
and/or red pepper if you have one, celery or caraway seeds if you
like that kind of thing, or shredded celery for an extra fresh taste.
