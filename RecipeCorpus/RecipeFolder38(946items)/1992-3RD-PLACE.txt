1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13-by-9-inch baking pan.

2. With an electric mixer, cream the butter, granulated sugar, eggs
and vanilla until light, 2 minutes. Add the chocolate and mix well.
Stop the mixer and fold in the flour then the nuts.

3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake just until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 minutes. Cool completely.

4. For the filling, mix all ingredients until smooth. Spread in an
even layer over the cooled brownies.

5. For the glaze, melt chocolate with butter; mix well. Pour over
filling and gently tilt pan so glaze covers the entire surface.
Refrigerate until glaze is set; cut into squares or sticks. For
holiday cookie trays, cut the brownies into small squares and
decorate them with holiday finery.
