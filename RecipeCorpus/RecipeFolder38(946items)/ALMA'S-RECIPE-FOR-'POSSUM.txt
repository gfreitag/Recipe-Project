Title: ALMA'S RECIPE FOR 'POSSUM
Categories: Meats, Game, Southern
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Lime
1 g  Water
1 c  Salt
1    Red pepper pod
Put 1/2 cup lime in about 1 gallon of boiling water and scald
quickly, and pull off hair while hot.  Scrape well--remove feet,
tail, and entrails--like you would a pig.  Cut off ears, remove eyes
and head if desired.  Pour hot water over it and clean thoroughly.

Put one cup salt in sufficient cold water to cover possum, add 1 pod
red pepper and let stand overnight.  In the morning remove salt water
and pour boiling water over it.  Cook in enough boiling water to boil
up over possum but not enough to cover.  Cook until skin can be
pierced with a fork easily, and let stand in water until ready for
baking.

When ready to bake, place possum in pan with skin side up.  Bake in a
moderate oven until crisp and brown.  If fire is too hot, skin will
blister and burn.

Carve possum and surround with potatoes (sliced or quartered) which
have been previously baked.
