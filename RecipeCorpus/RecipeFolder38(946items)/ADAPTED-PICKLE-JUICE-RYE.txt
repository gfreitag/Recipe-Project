3 c  Bread Flour
3 ts Fleischmann's Active Yeast
1 c  Sour Dill Brine
3/4 c  Water; warmed to 120 degrees
2 tb Crisco
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Dry Dill Weed
1 1/2 c  Med. Rye Flour
1 1/2 ts Caraway Seeds
1    Lg. Egg; room temp.
I used my crock dill brine and decreased the salt from the original
recipe which called for 2 ts. due to the high salt content of my
brine. I forgot the egg that is called for! I used 3 ts. Active Dry
Yeast instead of the 3 pkg. called for in the conventional recipe. I
warmed the brine and the water.
