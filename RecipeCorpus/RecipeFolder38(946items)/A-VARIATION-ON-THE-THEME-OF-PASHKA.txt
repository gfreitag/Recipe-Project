Title: A VARIATION ON THE THEME OF PASHKA
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 16 Servings
4    8 oz. pkgs cream cheese
1 c  (2 sticks) butter
3    Egg yolks
2 c  Sifted powdered sugar
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Toasted, slivered almonds
2 pt (or 3) fresh or frozen
Strawberries
Let cream cheese, butter and egg yolks stand at room temperature at
least 2 hours.  Beat cheese in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon or
blend at low speed in electric mixer. Add butter and continue
beating. When well blended, add sugar, then egg yolks, one at a time.
Add vanilla and fold in almonds.

Wash and dry the inside of a Pashka mold or a new 2 quart clay or
plastic flowerpot with drain holes in the bottom. Line the pot with a
double thickness of cheesecloth wrung out in cold water. Spoon cheese
mixture into the pot to the brim.  Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate several hours or overnight on a plate.

To unmold, trim around and discard top of the cheesecloth. Invert a
dessert plate over the opening of the flowerpot and quickly turn the
whole thing upside down.  Place on table and gently lift off pot,
tugging at the cheesecloth lining if necessary.   When the pot is
clear, gently remove the cheesecloth.

Garnish the base and top of the Pashka with whole strawberries and
strawberry halves.  Serve with additional crushed, sweetened
strawberries as a sauce. You may add some brandy or liqueur to the
sauce if you wish.
