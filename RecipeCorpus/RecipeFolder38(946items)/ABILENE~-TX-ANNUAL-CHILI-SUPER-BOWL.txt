Hope this ins't too late.  I haven't checked in on the board in a
while. We just had our annual Chili Super Bowl (Abilene, TX). They
make a pot to feed 5000. It's BIG pot. This recipe is pretty good
too. You will want to multiply the recipe items by 10.

Brown beef and drain. Add all ingredients and cover. Cook for 7-17
hours on medium high.

Good luck!  If you try this, let me know how your customers like it.
