Title: ADOBE BREAD
Categories: Bakery, Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
1 pk Active dry yeast (1/4 oz)
1/4 c  Lukewarm water
1 ts Salt
3 tb Vegetable shortening, melted
1 c  Cold water
4 1/2 c  All purpose flour
In a large bowl, soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. Mix the
salt, 2 tablespoons of the shortening, and the cold water together
and add to the yeast mixture. Sift in the flour gradually, beating
well after each addition for a smooth consistency.  You will probably
have to knead in the final cup of flour. Shape the dough into a ball,
brish lightly with the remaining shortening, and cover with a dry
cloth.  Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in bulk, anout 1
hour. Punch the dough down and, on a floured board, knead about 5
minutes. Shape into 2 round loaves on a well greased baking sheet.
Cover with a dry cloth and set to rise another 45 minutes. Preheat
the oven to 400F. Bake the loaves on a cookie sheet 50 minutes, until
they are light brown and sound hollow when tapped.
