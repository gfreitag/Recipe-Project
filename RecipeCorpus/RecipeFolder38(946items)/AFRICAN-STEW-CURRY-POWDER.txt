Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the
heavy influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders
are made from different proportions of spices, dried and ground.
Spices can be dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low
temperature oven, or on top of the stove in a dry skillet. If using a
skillet be sure to shake the spices constantly so they don't burn.
Grinding is usually done with a mortar and pestle.  Curry powders are
not necessarily hot, they are made that way by the addition of chili
peppers.

Dry spices, grind to a powder and bottle in an airtight jar. Use 2
teas. powder or as much as is required for 400 g or 1 lb stew meat.
Coconut milk (see below) can be used in this curry.
