1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 15- by 10-inch jelly-roll pan.
Cream butter, sugar, egg and vanilla in mixing bowl. Stir in cinnamon
and salt. Add flour, a little at a time. Blend well. Press into pan
to 1/4 ~inch thickness with wax paper.

2. Brush beaten egg white over dough. Combine streusel ingredients
in food processor. Process until butter is evenly blended. Sprinkle
streusel over dough. Bake 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack 15 minutes.
Cut into 2- by 1 1/2 -inch bars while still warm.
Note: The test kitchen found that a mixture of ground spices such as
cinnamon, allspice, ginger, cardamom and cloves also works nicely in
place of the cinnamon, and for the holiday season, a sprinkling of
colored sugar before baking brightens up these cookies.
