Preparation time: 2 1/2 hours Chilling time: Overnight Cooking time:
12 to 15 minutes

1. Beat butter and cream cheese in large bowl of electric mixer until
light.  Beat in flour and cream until well mixed. Divide dough into 4
portions. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
3. Sprinkle the work surface and the rolling pin generously with
confectioners' sugar. Roll out 1 dough portion at a time to about
1/4-inch thickness. Use a small (2-inch diameter) round cutter or
glass to cut out cookies. Transfer to ungreased baking sheets,
leaving 1 or 2 inches between each cookie. Make a small depression in
the center of the cookies with your fingertip. Fill scantily with
jam, jelly, preserves, cheese or nut filling. (If you use too much
filling it will run out onto the baking sheet.) 4. Bake until bottoms
are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Sprinkle
generously with confectioners' sugar while still warm.

Cream cheese filling: Beat together 1 package (8 ounces) softened
cream cheese, 1 egg yolk, 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon
pure vanilla extract until well mixed.

Nut filling: Cook 1 cup coarsely ground walnuts in 2 tablespoons
butter with  1/3 cup granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon pure vanilla
extract until nuts  turn golden. Cool.
