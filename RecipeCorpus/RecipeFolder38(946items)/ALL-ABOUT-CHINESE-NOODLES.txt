* Cellophane noodles: Aka bean thread; mung bean flower noodles. Soak
in hot water first before using, but not before frying. Do not boil.
Good in soups and stir-fries. * Rice flour noodles: Aka Mai fun (like
angel hair pasta). Good for stir-frying. * Chow fun: lg noodles; toss
with vegetables and meat. Dried noodles: Aka Rice sticks. Don't boil
before using. Thin- soak in warm water to soften; thick- cover with
boiling water, let stand to soften. In hot oil these are the noodles
that will puff up. Wheat Noodles: Fresh-- Cantonese style, aka
regular mein or lo mein noodles (will say so on pkg), can be thick or
thin. Cook to taste, 4 mins or so in boiling water to soften. Do not
cook Chinese noodles al dente; they must be soft. Typed by Sherilyn
