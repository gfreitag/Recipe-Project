FOR THE PASTA:  Pour the flour onto a large pastry board. Make a well
in the middle and add the eggs, water and salt. Work the eggs and
water into the flour, then knead to a smooth elastic dough, about 10
minutes. Roll the dough out as thinly as possible in two sheets.

FOR THE FILLING:  Combine all of the Bechamel Thick Sauce ingredients
together and cook until thickened, then let cool. Saute the scallions
in the butter. Add the remaining Stuffing ingredients to the pan. Mix
the stuffing with the Bechamel Thick Sauce.

FOR THE SAUCE:  Reduce the whipping cream by half then add the
remaining Sauce ingredients.  Cook until a slight boil.

ASSEMBLY:  On one sheet of the pasta arrange teaspoons of the
stuffing in litle piles at regular intervals, about 1 1/2 inches
apart. Cover with the second sheet of dough and press with the finger
tips around the edges of the stuffing.  Cut the Agnolotti square with
a pastry wheel and make quite sure the edges are firmly sealed.
Sprinkle lightly with flour and let them rest for 30 minutes,turning
them after 15 minutes.

COOKING:  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
Agnolotti and cook for 12 minutes.  Lift them out with a slotted
spoon and transfer to a heated serving dish. Add the Sauce and top
with Parmesan cheese if desired.
