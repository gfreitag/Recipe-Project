750 g  Pork fillet, leg or loin
1/4 c  Butter
500 g  New potatoes; peeled
250 g  Small mushrooms
1 c  Red wine
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 ts Crushed coriander seeds
Cut pork into approximately 3 cm (1-1/4 inch) pieces leaving some fat
on meat as this is desirable.

Heat half the butter in a heavy based pan and brown potatoes. Remove
and keep aside.

Add remaining butter and brown pork on each side, push to side of pan.

Trim and clean mushrooms and fry quickly in pan next to meat. Stir to
combine.  Reduce heat to low.

Pour in wine, add salt and pepper to taste and place potatoes on top.

Sprinkle with coriander seeds, cover pan with lid and simmer over low
heat for 45 minutes or until pork and potatoes are tender.

Serve with a tossed green salad.
