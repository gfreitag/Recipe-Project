Title: 40 CLOVE GARLIC CHICKEN (SVMF28B) 1I29
Categories: Chicken, Main dish
2    Chicken breasts -- split
Yield: 4 Servings
4 TB Oil
4 TB Butter
1/4 c  Sweet vermouth
40 c  Garlic; peeled -- whole

Melt butter in frying pan.  Add oil.  Brown chicken well on both
sides. Remove chicken.  Add garlic and saute for about a minute. Add
dry vermouth. Stir. Put chicken back in the pan on top of garlic.
Cover and simmer about one hour, turning chicken every once in a
while. When done serve chicken with cloves of garlic. Garlic will pop
out of the shell easily and you can either mash it onto some hot
bread or eat it plain with the chicken. The garlic carmelizes when
cooked with the vermouth and it is almost sweet-tasting. Good luck
and I hope you enjoy this!!
