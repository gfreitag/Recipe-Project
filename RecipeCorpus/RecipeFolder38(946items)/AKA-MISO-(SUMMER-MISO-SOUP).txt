Title: AKA MISO (SUMMER MISO SOUP)
Categories: Japan, Soups/stews, Submitted
Yield: 6 Servings
6 c  Ichiban dashi (recipe)
1/2 c  Aka miso (red soybean paste)
Aji-no-moto (msg)
Place the ichiban dashi in a 2 quart saucepan and set a sieve over
the pan. With the back of a large spoon, rub the miso through the
sieve, moistening it from time to time with some of the dashi to help
force it through more easily.
Bring the soup to a simmer over moderate heat. Then remove from the
heat and stir in a small pinch of MSG.
Pour the soup into bowls, add misoshiru no-me (miso soup garnish -
see recipes) and serve at once. If the soup seems to be seperating,
stir to recombine it.
Miso soups are sweeter than other Japanese soups and usually are
served toward the end of a formal Japanese meal.
