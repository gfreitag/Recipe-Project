Title: ALL-PURPOSE POTATO-BASED GRAVY
Categories: Potatoes, Sauces, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
2 sm Or 1 lg potato
1 c  Water
1    Brown onion -- coursely
Minced
Coursely ground black
Pepper
Olive oil -- amt. opt
Veggie stock concentrate --
(such as Vegex
Or Organic Gourmet
Vegetable
Broth concentrate) -- to
Taste
(Optional: Any combination of stuff like poppy seeds, celery seeds,
toasted sesame seeds, Lawry's Seasoned Salt) Microwave the potato(s)
for about 8 minutes more or less, depending on your potato(s) and
your microwave. Then, put them in a blender (do not peel) with the
water and whirl until you have a puree. Set aside. In a hot skillet
(I use my trusty electric wok), saute the onion in the olive oil
until it's the way you like it. Pour in the potato puree, and moosh
it around, cooking the hell out of it until it's also the way you
like it (is there any other way?), adding seasonings to taste. That's
it!  This is great over steamed veggies or grains or biscuits or
toast  or eggs or corn on the cob or spinach even potatos! You could
try it over ice cream or fruit salad but you'd be really weird.
