Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the
heavy influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders
are made from different proportions of spices, dried and ground.
Spices can be dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low
temperature oven, or on top of the stove in a dry skillet. If using a
skillet be sure to shake the spices constantly so they don't burn.
Grinding is usually done with a mortar and pestle.  Curry powders are
not necessarily hot, they are made that way by the addition of chili
peppers.

Brown the spices in a hot oven until crisp.  Grind and seal in an
airtight container until used.  Add 1 teas. powdered turmeric, and
chili powder to taste for every teas. of your special curry powder.
