(Not-Just-Your-Ordinary!) Combine chuck through seasonings. Add milk
and breadcrumbs. If necessary, add a little additional milk until it
just barely keeps together in your hands when you try to pick it up.
In small open roasting pan, form into oval. Lay strips of bacon on
top. Bake at 450 for approximately 1 hour, or until bacon is crisp.
Remove to paper towels to drain before placing on serving platter.
