Categories: Fish/shellf
Yield: 6 Servings
6    (4 to 6 oz each) Alaska
Salmon fillets, thawed
1 cn (16 oz.) whole berry
Cranberry sauce
1/2 c  Cranberry juice cocktail
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Dry vermouth
1 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger root
1 ts Asian sesame oil

Place salmon in a large, non-reactive pan or dish. Combine remaining
ingredients except vegetable oil. Pour marinades over salmon, turning
to coat both sides. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 1 hour.
To cook, remove salmon from marinade, reserving marinade. Pat salmon
dry with a paper towel. Heat small amount of oil in large skillet
over medium-high heat. Cook salmon, working in batches if necessary,
for 10 minutes per inch of thickness, measured at thickest part, or
until salmon just flakes when tested with a fork. Remove salmon from
pan and keep warm. Discard oil from pan. Add reserved marinade. Cook
stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, 8-10 minutes. Serve
salmon fillets with approximately 1/4 cup sauce per serving.
