Mix all except rolls together in bowl. Seperate rolls, and roll them out
thinner (like pie crust). Place 2 - 3 TB of filling in middle of long edge.
Fold corners up and roll up remaining flap.  Bake at 350 F until brown
(10-12 minutes).  These are quick, easy and great for unexpected company.
They look better if you use clear vanilla.
