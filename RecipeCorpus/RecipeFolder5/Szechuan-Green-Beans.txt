Title: Szechuan Green Beans
Categories: Vegetables, Microwave, Beans
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Hot red-pepper flakes
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Rice wine vinegar
1 lb Green beans, tipped/tailed
6    Garlic cloves, peeled
2    Quarter-sized slices ginger
2    Scallions, cut in 2" lengths
1 tb Vegetable oil
Peel garlic and ginger.  Smash garlic.  Trim scallions and cut into 2"
lengths (don't be fancy, the next step is a food processor). Place garlic,
ginger, and scallions into a food processor and process until finely
chopped.  Remove to a 14x11x2" dish.  Add oil and pepper flakes.  Cook in
microwave, uncovered, at 100% for 3 minutes.

Remove from microwave and stir in remaining ingredients, tossing gently to
coat green beans.  Cook, uncovered, at 100% for 10-15 minutes, stirring 4-5
times.

Serve hot or cold.

Notes:  This recipe takes only a tablespoon of oil for a pound of green
beans.  I have used half that with good success.  These are good cold for
picnics or between meal snacks.
