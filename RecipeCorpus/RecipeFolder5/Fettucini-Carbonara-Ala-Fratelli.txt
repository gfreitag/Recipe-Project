Title: Fettucini Carbonara Ala Fratelli
Categories: Italian, Pasta
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
1    Egg yolk
2 x  Servings fettucini, cooked
Chopped parsley for garnish
3 sl Bacon, cut into 1" pieces
3 tb Onion, diced
4    Garlic cloves, crushed
3/4 c  White wine
3/4 c  Half-and-half
In an 10" pan, fry the bacon until the fatty portions are just beginning to
turn clear.  Add the onion, and saute over high heat until the onion is
translucent.  Drain off the fat, remove the bacon and onion, and set aside.

Add the garlic to the pan, and deglaze the pan with the wine, scraping up
any bacon leavings.  Simmer for about 1 minute.  Add the half-and-half to
the pan, and wait until the sauce come back up to the simmer (with
practice, this can be done so that the half-and-half does not curdle in the
wine.  If it does curdle, that's okay - the taste will still be there, it
just won't look as nice).  Add the Romano cheese (parmesan is acceptable,
but the taste will be a little more pungent), and stir until smooth, about
30 seconds.  At this point, the sauce may be removed from the heat and held
for about 15 minutes.

To serve, bring the sauce back up to temperature.  Add the cooked fettucini
to the pan and toss to coat the pasta.  Add the bacon, onion and raw egg
yolk, and toss to mix thoroughly.  Dish onto two plates, garnish with a bit
of chopped parsley, and serve immediately.
