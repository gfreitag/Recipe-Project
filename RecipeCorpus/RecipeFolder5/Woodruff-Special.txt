Title: Woodruff Special
Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 servings
1 qt Spaghetti sauce
1 lb Chopped beef
1/2 ts Oregano
Garlic salt to taste
Salt and pepper to taste
4    Slices bacon
Cabbage leaves (1/4 head)
1 md Onion, chopped
2 c  Rice, cooked
1 cn Sauerkraut (large can, well
Drained)
DIRECTIONS Fry the bacon fairly crisp and reserve it. Use the bacon fat to
grease a pan or casserole (a 10" x 12" x 2" pan is just about right for
this recipe). Tear cabbage leaves as necessary to line the bottom of the
pan, about 2-3 leaves thick. Break up the chopped beef and crumble on top
of the cabbage leaves. Crumble the bacon pieces on top of the beef. Add the
chopped onion, and then add salt, pepper, garlic salt and oregano. Cover
this with the cooked rice and then the sauerkraut. Cover with another layer
of cabbage leaves, about 2-3 leaves thick. Finally, pour the spaghetti
sauce on top, distributing it evenly.
Bake, covered at 325 degrees for 3-4 hours.
