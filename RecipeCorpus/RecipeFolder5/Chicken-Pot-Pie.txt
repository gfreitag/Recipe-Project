Wash, clean and cut chicken into individual portions. Place a layer of
chicken in the bottom of a large iron kettle and cover with thick
slices of raw potato, then with slices of onion and salt & pepper.
Roll dough out rather thick and cut in 2 inch squares and place on top
of onion. Continue until kettle is filled having the top layer of pie
dough. Add water to cover contents halfway. Cover kettle tightly and
cook over a low flame until chicken is tender.
