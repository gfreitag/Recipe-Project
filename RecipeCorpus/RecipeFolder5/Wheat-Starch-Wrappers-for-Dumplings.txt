Title: Wheat Starch Wrappers for Dumplings
Categories: Chinese
Yield: 30 servings
1 tb Peanut oil plus more to oil
The wrappers
1 c  Wheat starch
1/4 c  Tapioca starch
1 c  Boiling water
Combine the wheat starch and tapioca starch in a mixing bowl.  When
the water reaches a boil immediately pour it into the flour and stir
vigorously into a ball, with a wooden spoon.  The hot boiling water cooks
the starches.  Add the oil to the dough and mix together as well as
possible.  The dough at this point is quite thick and lumpy.

While hot, gather up the dough and knead on a lightly oiled surface
until smooth and well blended, about 3 minutes.  It should feel a bit
rubbery and putty-like.  Cover with a damp towel.

Dough is ready to make Ha Gow or Fun Gwau.

Makes enough dough for 2 1/2 dozen Ha Gow or Fun Gwau dumplings.
