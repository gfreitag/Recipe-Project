Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, Ethnic
Yield: 2 servings
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
1/4 ts Salt
50 g  Margerine
50 g  Wholemeal flour
50 g  Plain white flour
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
50 g  Peeled and diced potato
50 g  Peeled and diced carrots
210 g  Chick peas
Salt
Pepper
1/2    Peeled and chopped onion
1 tb Oil
1/2    Crushed garlic clove
1/2 tb Ground coriander
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Filling.

1. Fry the onion in the oil for 5 minutes and add the garlic, spices,
carrot and potato. Cook for ten minutes, or until the vegetables
are tender.

2. Add the chick peas and season with the salt and pepper. Leave to cool
down.

3. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/GM6.

Pastry:

1. Sift the flours and salt into a large bowl. Add the margerine and
rub into the flour with your hands until the mixture is like bread-
crumbs.

2. Add the cold water and press the mixture together to form a dough.
Turn out onto a floured board and divide into 2 equal pieces.

3. Take out one piece of the dough and knead lightly, pressing it into a
round shape.

4. Roll it into a circle about 15cm across. Put 1/2 of the vegetable
mixture on top and fold into a pasty type shape and press the edges
together.

5. Pierce a couple of holes in the top and bake for 20 minutes or until
crisp.

This recipe is also nice with filo pastry, or the samosa packets you can
buy. If you use filo pastry remember to brush the outside with some melted
margerine or butter to prevent sticking.
