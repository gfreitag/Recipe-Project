Title: Lamb Patties Moroccan Style with Harissa Sauce
Categories: Lamb, Moroccan, Sauces
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Grated onion
4 tb Chopped parsley
Salt to taste
1 tb Vegetable oil
Harissa sauce
1 1/2 lb Ground lean lamb
1 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Crushed dried hot peppers
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
1 ts Ground cumin
2 ts Chopped garlic
Put the lamb in a mixing bowl and add all of the ingredients except the
vegetable oil and harissa sauce. Blend the mixture thoroughly by hand.
Shape the mixture into 8 equal size patties similar to hamburgers. Heat the
oil in a non stick skillet large enough to hold all of the patties. Two
pans may be necessary. Add the patties to the skillet. Cook them over
medium high heat about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, depending on the degree
of doneness desired. Drain on paper towels and serve with the harissa sauce
on the side.
