Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Baking soda
4 oz Candied papaya, chopped
4 oz Candied mango, chopped
4 oz Candied pineapple, chopped
4 oz Dried apricot, chopped
8 oz Chopped Macadamia nuts
8 oz White chocolate chunks
1/2 c  Butter

1 c  + 2 T all-purpose flour

A taste of the tropics in every bite!

Preheat oven to 375ø.

In a large bowl, cream butter. Gradually add brown and white sugars and
beat until creamy. Beat in egg and vanilla.

Sift and stir in flour, salt and baking soda. Fold in candied fruits, nuts
and white chocolate.

Drop batter by teaspoonfuls, well apart, on a greased cookie sheet. Bake
at 375ø for about 8-10 minutes. Remove to wire racks and let cool.

Note: If you can't purchase all of the candied fruits, use what you have on
hand-it will still be scrumptious.

Yield: 2 1/2 - 3 dozen. Larry Rosenberg, author of Muffins & Cupcakes
