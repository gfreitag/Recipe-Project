Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman Jello Flavored Cake In one mixing
bowl sift 1-1/4 cups of the sugar, flour, baking powder and gelatin
together. In another bowl, combine milk, oil and lemon extract.

Beat the liquids into the dry ingredients until batter is smooth. Beat egg
yolks in one at a time into the batter. Whip egg whites until stiff but not
dry with 1/4 cup of sugar. Fold the egg whites lightly but thoroughly into
the batter.

Grease ring pan with vegetable shortening and dust with flour. Spoon batter
into pan and bake at 325 F. 40 to 50 minutes until cake springs to the
touch. Turn out immediately onto a wire rack.

Decorate with a thin icing and trim with what ever you want.

Note: I used strawberry jello and extract and decorated after drizzling
icing on top with fresh strawberries cut in half. I also have used orange
jello. Decorate with candied orange slices. I also found that 40 minutes
was too long to bake this cake in my oven.
