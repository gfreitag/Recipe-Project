1/2 pk Sausage, fully cooked
1 c  Rice, long cooking white
Louisiana hot sauce
Black pepper
2 cn Dark Red Kidney Beans
1/2    Onion; Chopped
Cajun, Creole seasoning
Cayenne pepper
Cook rice according to package directions.  Microwave is best.  Takes about
20 minutes.  Meanwhile, in saucepan, combine cans of beans, 2 cans water,
Louisiana hot sauce (Red Devil is right kind but not Texas Pete or tabasco.
Sauce is based on cayenne peppper.)  Also onion, Creole and/or Cajun
seasoning, avail. in spice or Cajun section of store; but LOOK OUT FOR
THOSE THAT CONTAIN SALT if so, don't add too much and don't add extra salt.
If Cajun seasoning contains salt, you can easily get too salty- Also may
add cayenne pepper to taste; Black pepper.  Chop up sausage (any kind is OK
as long as "Fully cooked"; hot is preferable to most who prefer a hot
taste-) Taste as you go to make sure not too salty or too hot.  Boil slowly
for about 20 minutes, until it begins to thicken and smells REAL good.
Serve beans in bowl OVER white rice.
