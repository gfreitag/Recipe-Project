Cover crabs with boiling salt water and boil for 30 minutes. Drain off

spongy fingers and the stomach, which is found under the head. Pick
out all the meat and set aside. Clean the upper shells of the crabs
thoroughly. Melt the butter and add the flour and blend. Stir in cream
and cook until mixture thickens, stirring constantly. Add the parsley,
mashed egg yolks, seasonings and crab meat. Fill the shells with this
mixture and cover with bread crumbs. Bake at 350-F for 10 minutes or
put in a frying basket and plunge into hot oil until golden brown.
