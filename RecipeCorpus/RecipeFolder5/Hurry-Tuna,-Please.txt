Title: Hurry Tuna, Please
Categories: Casseroles, Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Milk
1 c  Chicken bouillon; (that's
-one cube of bouillon in one
-cup of water)
1    (8-ounce) package egg
Noodles; cooked & drained
Or
1 c  Cooked rice
-----INGREDIENTS-----
1    Large 12-1/2-ounce can white
Or light meat tuna, drained
2 tb Vegetable Oil
1    Apple; cored and chopped
1 sm Onion; chopped
1/2 ts Curry
3 tb Flour
THIS MEAL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRECK AND QUICK TO MAKE

Fry the apple and onion in a little oil until lightly cooked. Add
flour and slowly stir in milk and bouillon. That will make a lumpy white
sauce.  (The lumps are from the apple and onions and are not your fault.)
Add tuna, breaking it up well, and sprinkle in the curry. Mix well. Serve
over hot noodles which take nine minutes to cook and should have been
started back while the apples and onions were cooking. If time is not a
problem, serve this over rice.  (Now that should have been started BEFORE
the apples and onions.)
