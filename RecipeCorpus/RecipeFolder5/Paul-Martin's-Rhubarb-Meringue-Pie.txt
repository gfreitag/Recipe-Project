leadership hopefulls. Paul Martin's Rhubarb Meringue Pie

To make pastry, sift flour and salt and cut in shortening until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs. Add water and work with a fork until mixture holds
together. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Roll pastry
and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Prick with a fork and bake at 400F for 10
minutes.

For filling, sift sugar and flour together and add rhubarb. Cook slowly
until mixture thickens, stirring constantly. Stir in egg yolk and cook 1
minute longer. Remove from heat and add orange juice, rind and butter. Cool
and pour into baked pastry shell.

Meringue: beat egg whites until frothy. Add sugar by the tablespoon,
beating until stiff. Add vanilla. Spread meringue over the pie and return
to 350F oven for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly browned.
