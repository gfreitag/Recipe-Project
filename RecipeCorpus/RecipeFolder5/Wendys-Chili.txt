Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman I have never tried it, but I
found this recipe in a newspaper that says this is the recipe to make
Wendys chili. WENDYS CHILI Brown beef in oil. Break meat into tiny rice
size pieces. Place onion soup and half of cooked beef into a blender and
process on high speed until it resembles cement mortar. Place with
unblended beef into 2-1/2 qt saucepan. Add remaining ingredients and simmer
until flavors are blended.
