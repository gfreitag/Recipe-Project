This recipe is from my father-in-law Ed Stang. He just dumped in whatever
goodies are on hand; they always taste great.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a medium bowl add all-purpose and whole wheat flours, baking powder and
salt. In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugars; blend in eggs and
vanilla. Beat well.

Add dry ingredients and mix well. Add oats, fruit, nuts and chocolate
bits; mix in thoroughly. Dough will be crumbly.

Drop by teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheets, using fingers to shape
together. Bake at 350ø about 12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to
rack to cool.

Yield: about 6 dozen. Kathleen Stang, freelance food writer, Seattle, WA
