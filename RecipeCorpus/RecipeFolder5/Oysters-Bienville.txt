Here's a popular Creole recipe, not, of course, Cajun, from New Orleans. If
you can get the ingredients, it is a true winner. This is by Austin Leslie,
probably the top Creole-Soul chefs in New Orleans. This is a "Crescent City
Classic." Those of you in Dry Dock will have to suffer without, or better
yet, Come On Way Down Yonder. OYSTERS BIENVILLE (N.O. pronunciation =
Bee-En-Vill, not quite true French) Preheat 6 pie pans filled with rock
salt. Preheat broiler to highest flame or oven to 475 degrees. Place boiled
oysters in shells and cover each with 2 tbs. cold Bienville sauce.

Sprinkle with bread crumbs and cheese and place on cookie sheets. Sprinkle
melted butter over oysters to moisten amd place under broiler or in oven
until lightly browned and bubbly. Place six oysters on each pre-heated pie
pan and rock salt. Serve 6, immediately.
