Title: Chinese Almond Cookies
Categories: Cookies, Chinese
Yield: 1 servings
2    Eggs, beaten
4 ts Almond extract
Almond halves for garnish
Additional egg for glaze
4 c  Flour
2 1/2 c  Sugar
4 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1 lb Shortening
These delicate cookies melt in your mouth and are the perfect
accompaniment to a Chinese banquet.

In a large bowl, sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda
together. Gradually beat in the shortening. When the shortening is well
blended, add beaten eggs and almond extract. If mixture is sticky, add one
or two more tablespoons flour.

When mixture is well blended, remove from bowl and separate into four
portions. Shape each portion into a log about 1-inch in diameter. Wrap in
plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Lightly grease baking sheets.

Remove logs from refrigerator and cut each log into pieces 3/4- inch
thick. Use your hands to roll each slice into a ball. Place the balls on
cookie sheets and flatten slightly with your finger tips. Brush gently with
beaten egg and place half an almond in the center of the cookie.

Bake at 350ø for 12-15 minutes (do not allow cookies to brown they should
be almond colored). Remove from oven and let cookies cool on cookie sheets
for about two minutes, then remove to racks to cool completely. (They tend
to crumble if you remove immediately to racks.) Store in tightly covered
tins.

Note: These cookies may be frozen for up to 2 months Thaw in original
wrapping and, if desired, freshen in a warm oven for 4-5 minutes.

Yield: 7-8 dozen. Jane Bradley, author of Southern Style (published by The
