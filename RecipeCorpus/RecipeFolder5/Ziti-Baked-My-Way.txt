Title: Ziti Baked My Way
Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/3 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
2    (32 oz) Jars Spaghetti Sauce
-----OR-----
2 qt Italian Homemade Sauce
-----INGREDIENTS-----
1 lb Ziti or Mostaccioli
- Pasta;, cooked and drained
3 lb Ricotta (low-fat)
THIS IS VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE AND DO THE NIGHT BEFORE

Cook the ziti or mostaccioli pasta until al dente. Drain.

In a large roasting dish, spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom.
Sprinkle with 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese. Soften the ricotta cheese in
Microwave by cooking on LOW (30%) for about 1-1/2 to 2 minutes.

Layer with half each of ziti, ricotta cheese, sauce, and half of remaining
Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers. Bake in a preheated 350F. degree oven for
approximately 1 hour.  Let stand for 1/2 hour before serving. NOTE: If
making the night before, cover with plastic wrap.

DO NOT COVER WITH FOIL if dish is to be stored as the tomato mixture reacts
against the foil.

NOTE:  Remove plastic wrap and cover with foil before baking.
