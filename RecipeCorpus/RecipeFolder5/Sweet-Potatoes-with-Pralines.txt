SWEET POTATOES WITH PRALINES Preheat oven to 350F.

Peel and boil sweet potatoes in a covered saucepan until tender - about 20
min. Drain and mash. Mix in the softened butter, sugar, vanilla, and milk.
Pour into a baking dish or casserole.

Bring cream to simmer in a small saucepan. Add brown sugar and stir until
dissolved. Cook over medium heat to soft ball stage - 235F. Remove from
heat and beat in butter and pecans. Pour over sweet potato mixture.

All of the above may be done up to 2 days in advance and stored in the
fridge. Then just heat in the oven until bubbling hot and enjoy.
