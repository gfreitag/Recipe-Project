Cooking Empanadas con Picadillo

Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl, or place in a food
processor and mix once or twice. Rub in the margerine and shortening until
the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, or work in the food processor,
being careful not to over-mix. Mix the liquid gradually, adding enough to
bring the pastry together into a ball. (In a food processor, add the liquid
through the funnel while the motor is running.) Wrap the pastry well, and
chill for 20 to 30 minutes.

Brown the ground meat well, and drain away as much of the fat as possible.

until the onion is soft. Add to the meat. Then add the cocoa, flour,
spices, oregano, and seasonings. Stir well and cook briefly before adding
the chilies and the tomatoes. Cook slowly for 10-15 minutes.

Add the nuts and the olives, and allow to cool. (Oh, you were supposed to
add the parsley with the tomatoes, above.)

Roll out the pastry on a floured surface. (We didn't do this. We ran the
dough through the pasta machine - much easier! We found the #3 setting on
our Atlas pasta maker to be the right thickness.)

Cut the dough into 4 inch rounds. (I used a leftover container from ricotta
cheese to get the right size.)

Place about 1-1/2 tablespoons of filling on the dough circle. Fold over,
and press to seal. If the dough is a little dry, moisten the edges with a
little warm water (with your finger) before pressing the edges together.
Crimp the edges with a fork. With a toothpick, prick several holes on the
top of the empanada to allow the steam to escape.

Mix the glaze ingredients together. Place empanadas on a baking sheet, and
brush with the egg glaze.

Bake at 425 for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.

If you like, you can freeze these. To bake frozen empanadas, place the
frozen pastries on a cooking sheet and brush with the egg glaze. Bake for
30-35 minutes at 425 degrees.

Makes 15 empanadas.
