Title: Acorns
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour, sifted
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 c  Butter, melted
3/4 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1 1/2 c  Pecans, chopped fine,*
* divided in 3/4 cup portions

This is an easy yet elegant butter-pecan cookie shaped to resemble an
acorn and dipped in melted chocolate chips and chopped pecans.

Preheat oven to 375ø.

In a large bowl, beat together butter, brown sugar, 3/4 cup chopped pecans
and vanilla on medium speed until well blended. Add flour and baking powder
and mix well, using low speed.

Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Slightly flatten by pressing balls onto
ungreased cookie sheets; pinch tops to point to resemble acorns. Bake for
10-12 minutes at 375ø. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.

In top of a double boiler over simmering water, melt chocolate chips,
stirring until smooth. Remove from heat; keep double boiler over water. Dip
large ends of cooled cookies into melted chocolate, then roll in chopped
pecans. Cool to set chocolate.
