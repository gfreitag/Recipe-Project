Title: Bubbie's Dairy Noodle Kugel
Categories: Ethnic, Pasta
Yield: 10 servings
1 c  Sour cream
1 c  Cottage cheese
Salt; to taste
1/2 c  Raisins ; optional golden
16 oz Noodle; cooked package/fine
6    Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar; to taste
1    Margarine; melted
Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, drain well.
Add the other ingredients and mix until combined. Put into a 9 x 13 baking
dish (greased) and bake at 350 degrees for an hour. Never fails.

You can serve with fruit (fresh) or put pie filling over it. Try putting
some sour cream on top. Enjoy You can incorperate the egg yolks and beat
the whites for a very light texture. I sometimes add a bit of lemon juice.

This is a very forgiving recipe. If you leave the sour cream, sugar and
raisins out, you have a wonderful salt kugel to serve with chicken or beef.
