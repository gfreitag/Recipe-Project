Cookery, by Carol Medina Maze Chili Colorado Power level: medium high
Cooking time: 20 minutes Coarsely grind the cilantro and cumin seeds in a
spice grinder, and then put into the bowl of the food processor. Break the
chili pods into small pieces, and coarsely grind in the spice grinder, and
then add to food processor bowl. Add the garlic and onion to the food
processor, and process until the onions are chopped.

Add the remaining ingredients and process until pureed. Place the mixture
in a 2-quart casserole dish. Cover and microwave on 70% (medium high) for
twenty minutes, stirring after 10 minutes. (I assume you could make it on
top of the stove, too.)

Makes 3-1/2 cups.
