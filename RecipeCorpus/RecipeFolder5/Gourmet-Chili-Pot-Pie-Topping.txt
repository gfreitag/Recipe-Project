GOURMET CHILI POT PIE TOPPING (from Joan Gruzen) Into a bowl sift together
the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder. Add the butter, milk and the
egg, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Stir in the cheddar and
the chilies and cover the top of the casserole in which you have the chili.

Bake the potpie in the middle of a preheated 400 oven for 10 minutes.
Reduce the heat to 350 and bake the potpie for 30 minutes more.
