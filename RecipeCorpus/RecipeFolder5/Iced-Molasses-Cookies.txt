Children love these because the ginger and molasses flavors are not
overwhelming.

In a large bowl, mix molasses, sugar, shortening and hot water. Stir to
combine thoroughly, although shortening doesn't need to melt completely.

In a separate bowl, mix baking soda, ginger and cinnamon with 4 cups of
flour. Mix into liquids, stirring to blend well. Gradually add enough of
the additional flour to make a dough stiff enough to roll. Chill 1-2 hours
before baking.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Grease cookie sheets. Roll out dough to about
1/6-inch thick and cut shapes with your favorite cookie cutter. Bake 8-11
minutes at 350ø until done. Cool completely and frost with decorative
frosting. Cookies can also be dusted with decorative sugar or sprinkles
prior to baking.

To make frosting, beat egg whites until frothy, then beat in sugar and
vanilla. If you like, separate the icing into several bowls and add a drop
or two of food coloring. To yellow, add 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract.

Yield: 7-10 dozen, depending on size of cookie cutters. Martina Boudreau,
