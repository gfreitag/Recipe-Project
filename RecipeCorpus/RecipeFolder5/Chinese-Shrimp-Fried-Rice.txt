1/3 c  Light soy sauce **
6 x  Green onions, chopped
Vegetable cooking spray

Preparation time: 40 mins. Cooking Time: 15 to 20 mins

Rinse, peel and devein shrimp. Coat a 10 to 12" non-stick skillet with
cooking spray and melt butter over high heat. Make an omelet by adding the
eggs to the milk and salt and pepper to taste and whisking until fluffy.
Pour egg mixture into hot skillet and spread evenly. Cook until puffy and
set. Remove omelet with spatula, place in a plate and chop with a knife and
fork. Set aside.

Reheat skillet; add sesame oil. Cook Spanish onions on medium heat until
slightly transparent, about 3 mins. Add shrimp, cook until they turn plump
and pink, about 3 mins. Then add ginger, sherry, bean sprouts and omelet
pieces. Cook on low heat and stir frequently so that sprouts are thoroughly
covered with the wine and ginger. Add the rice and thoroughly stir mixture.

Add soy sauce and continue to toss mixture so that the soy sauce coats all
the rice. Add green onions and continue to mix thoroughly. Serve
immediately.
