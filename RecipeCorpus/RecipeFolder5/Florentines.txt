These crisp, nutty cookies are said to be a gift from Florence, Italy. The
thin layer of chocolate spread over the bottoms makes them taste positively
decadent.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a bowl combine almonds, fruits and peels; set aside. In a medium
saucepan combine butter, milk, sugar and honey. Bring to a full rolling
boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Stir in almond mixture; stir
in 1/4 cup flour (adding more if mixture is too liquidy).

Drop by level tablespoonfuls, at least 3 inches apart, onto a greased and
floured baking sheet. (Prepare only 6 cookies at a time on a baking sheet.)
Using back of spoon, spread dough to 3- inch circles. Bake at 350ø for 8-10
minutes. Remove from oven and let stand 1 minute on baking sheet. Carefully
remove with spatula to waxed paper. Cool completely.

In a small saucepan melt chocolate pieces and shortening over low heat.
When cookies are cooled, evenly spread bottom of each cookie with about 1
teaspoon of the chocolate mixture. When chocolate is almost set, draw wavy
lines through it with tines of a fork. Store cookies, covered, in
refrigerator.
