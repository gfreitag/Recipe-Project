Wrap tortillas tightly in foil. Heat in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.
Cut the cheese into 6 sticks. In a bowl, stir together the refried beans,
1/2 cup onion, chili peppers, and chili powder. Remove one tortilla from
foil; recover remaining tortillas. Spread the tortillas with about 1/3 cup
of the bean mixture to within 2 inches of the edge. Top with 1 tablespoon
chopped tomato. Place one cheese stick in center of tortilla. Fold in two
sides; roll up jelly-roll style. Place on a greased baking sheet. Repeat
with remaining tortillas. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or
till heated through. Serve bundles warm. Spoon taco sauce atop each bundle
and sprinkle with additional sliced green onion, if desired.
