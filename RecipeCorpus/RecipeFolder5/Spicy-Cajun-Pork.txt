I saw this in Parade Magazine the other day. Don't have time to make this.
Probably time consuming but enjoyable to make if you have the time or the
weather (who wants to be indoors cooking in the Summer?) Don't make this
for the creep who puts ketchup on everything. Wouldn't it be annoying after
spending so much time cooking someone throws some unwanted condiment onto
the food? Enjoy!!
