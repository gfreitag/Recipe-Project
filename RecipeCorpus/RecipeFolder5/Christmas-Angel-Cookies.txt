Title: Christmas Angel Cookies
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Vanilla
2 c  Candied fruit, mixed
2 c  Broken pecans or almonds
1/2 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Cream cheese, softened
1 c  Light brown sugar,*
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2    Eggs
3 c  Flour
* firmly packed

The cream cheese gives these cookies a smooth texture, while the fruits
sparkle and sweeten the flavor. Nice for using the candied fruits that
didn't make it into the fruit cake.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large bowl, cream shortening and cream cheese until smooth and
fluffy. Add sugars and eggs, mixing well. In a seperate bowl, sift flour,
baking soda and salt together.

Add flour mixture to egg and sugar mixture; add vanilla. Mix well. Add
candied fruit and nuts.

Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake at 350ø
for about 10-12 minutes. The cookies will be just browned at the edges.

Hint: You may have to mix candied fruit and nuts in with your hands; a
little shortening on your fingers will keep the mixture from sticking.
