1 1/4 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley

Scrub mussels clean in several changes of fresh water and pull off beards.
Discard any mussels that are cracked or do not close tightly when tapped.
Put mussels into a saucepan with wine and water. Cover and cook over high
heat, shaking pan frequently, 6-7 minutes or until shells open. Remove
mussels, discarding any which remain closed. Strain liquid through a fine
sieve and reserve.

Heat butter and oil in a saucepan. Add onion, garlic, leek and fenugreek
and cook gently 5 minutes. Stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Add saffron
mixture, 2-1/2 cups of reserved cooking liquid and chicken stock. Bring to
a boil, cover and simmer gently 15 minutes. Meanwhile, keep 8 mussels in
shells and remove remaining mussels from shells. Add all mussels to soup
and stir in chopped parsley, salt, pepper and cream. Heat through 2-3
minutes. Garnish with parsley sprigs, if desired, and serve hot.
