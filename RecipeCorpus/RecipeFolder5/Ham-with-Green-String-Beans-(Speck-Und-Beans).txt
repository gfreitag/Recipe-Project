DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
*** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
if using a cooked ham.
Cover the piece of ham with cold water and set over a low flame to
cook for 3 hours. Add water from time to time during cooking in order
to have at least one quart of broth at all times. Wash and clean the
string beans, break into small pieces and add to the ham. Continue
cooking about 25 minutes. Pare and quarter the potatoes; add to the
beans and ham and cook about 25 or 30 minutes, or until beans and
potatoes are tender. About 15 minutes before serving, add salt and
pepper to taste. Serve hot, providing vinegar for those who like the
dish strongly flavored.
