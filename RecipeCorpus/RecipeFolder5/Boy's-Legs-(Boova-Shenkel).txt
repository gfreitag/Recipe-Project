DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
*** The recipe specified "butter and lard mixed" for "shortening".
Wash the meat, cover with water, add seasonings to taste and cook
slowly for several hours. Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into thin
slices. Cook until tender. Drain off all of the water, add the 3 Tbsp
of butter, salt and pepper to taste, parsley and onion. Mix well. Beat
the eggs, add to potatoes and beat mixture lightly. Let stand until
pastry is made. Sift together the flour, baking powder and 1/2 tsp
salt. Work in the 4 Tbsp of shortening and then add the water, using
only enough to hold dough together. Roll thin on a floured board and
cut into large circles, about 10 inches in diameter, spread with some
of the potato mixture, fold dough to form a semi-circle, pressing
edges together with prongs of fork. Drop into the hot meat and broth,
cover pot closely and boil about 25 minutes. While these are cooking
make a sauce of the 3 Tbsp of butter or bacon drippings, add the bread
cubes and brown. Stir in the milk. Arrange the "Boova Shenkel" on a
platter and pour over all the milk sauce. Serve at once.
