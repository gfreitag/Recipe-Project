mashed potatoes and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Let stand for four hours. To
the scalded milk, add the butter and stir until melted. When cool add
the eggs, 1/2 cup of sugar, and salt and combine with the yeast
mixture. Sift in the flour and knead thoroughly. Cover and let rise in
a warm place until morning. Roll out to about 1/4 inch thick, brush
the dough with melted butter and cut in 2 inch squares. Turn up the
four corners toward the center. Place on a greased baking sheet about
2 inches apart and let rise until light. Bake at 450-F for 20 minutes.
Remove from oven, brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with powdered
sugar. Serve hot with plenty of coffee.
