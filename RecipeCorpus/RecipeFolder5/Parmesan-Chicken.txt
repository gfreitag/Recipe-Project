Place 1/2 of bread crumbs on baking sheet. Then put 6 chicken

them so there is two inches between them. Spoon soup mixture onto
chicken breast so you have a mound on each about 1/3 cup of mixture.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes uncovered. Remove baking pan and
place the remaining bread crumbs on each piece to cover it completely.
Spread over the crumbs and chicken about 3 TBSP of melted butter each
and bake at 300 degrees for 30 minutes until golden brown.
Serve at once with a lemon wedge and a spear of green pepper.
Melted butter with 1/4 tsp. Marjoram to place on top of bread
