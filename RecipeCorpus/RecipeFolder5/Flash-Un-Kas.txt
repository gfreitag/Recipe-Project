DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
Work into the flour the butter and cream cheese. Chill thoroughly...
over night is not too long. Take pieces of dough and roll very thin,
as quickly as possible. Cut with a round cookie cutter, size of a
water glass or larger if desired. Mix together ingredients for one of
the fillings. Spread on dough, fold over and bake at 400-F until
brown. These may be shaped earlier and baked just before serving.
Serve as an appetizer with beer, except the anchovy or caviar which
should be served with cocktails. Make the anchovy and caviar
appetizers somewhat smaller than the ones that are to be served with
beer.
