Place meat in a bowl and add rice, salt, pepper, bacon bits, onion and
paprika. Add egg and mix thoroughly. Cut stem end off green peppers and
remove seeds and ribs. Soften peppers for a minute or two in boiling water,
then fill with the meat mixture. Place peppers upright in a deep saucepan.
Combine remaining ingredients and pour over peppers, the liquid should come
to about 2 inches from the top of the peppers. Add more tomato juice if
required. Cover and cook slowly for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Add more sugar or a
touch of lemon juice to adjust flavor.

Serves 6.
