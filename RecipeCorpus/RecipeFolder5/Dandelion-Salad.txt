DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
Carefully wash and prepare the dandelion as you would lettuce. Roll in
cloth and pat dry. Then put into a salad bowl and place in warm place.
Cut bacon in small pieces, fry quickly and drop over the dandelions.
Put the butter and cream into a skillet and melt over a slow fire.
Beat eggs, add salt, pepper, sugar and vinegar and mix with slightly
warm cream mixture. Pour into skillet and under increased heat, stir
until dressing becomes thick like custard. Take off and pour piping
hot over dandelion. Stir thoroughly. Never use dandelion after it has
begun to flower, for then it is apt to be bitter.
