Well, the folks are gone and I never took the time to gather any recipes
so I can't really put together any "old favorites", but wandering through
the collection here I'd have to say this would make a pretty durn good
sit down for a few folks.  Don't know how you'd deal with the dual stuffings
though ...

Title: BEGGARS' PURSES - GGhol
Categories: Appetizers, Kump
Yield: 6 servings
-----------------------------------CREPES-----------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Milk
4    Eggs
3 3/4 oz Pastry flour -=OR=-
3 oz - All-purpose flour -AND-
3/4 oz - Cake flour
1 pn Salt
1/2 oz Melted butter
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
Chives; blanched
Caviar
Sour cream
-(or creme fraiche)
Butter; melted
COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS for the crepes, except the butter. Whisk well and
pass through a fine strainer. Let rest 1 hour. Add butter before cooking
the crepes. Cook the crepes and be careful not to brown them. Lay the crepe
out on a piece of parchment or a clean towel (don't lay out more than 12 at
a time or they will dry out). Fill with a spoonful of caviar and sour
cream. Pull the edges of the crepes up to form small purses and tie with a
chive. Serve warm or at room temperature, lightly brushed with butter.
These crepes can also be rolled or folded in the more traditional manner if
forming the purses seems like a daunting task. The result is beautiful,
however, and worth the extra effort.

This elegant recipe comes from Katherine Alford, chief instructor at the
New York Cooking School. Katherine used to be the chef at the Quilted
Giraffe in New York. These crepes are a signature dish of that restaurant.

towels. Use additional butter to lightly coat the outside and top of bird,
lightly salt and pepper, and then cook according to directions. (20 per lb)

If you are lucky enough to have stuffing left over, shape into balls to
place beside the turkey when it has about 1-1/2 hours left to bake.

Preheat oven to 325~F. Rinse turkey and pat dry inside and out. Set aside.
Combine dried fruit, raisins, and apples in a medium-size bowl. Put orange

processor and process for 1 minute. Add 1 cup each of tequila and Grand
Marnier, then pour the mixture over the fruit and let rest 15 minutes.
Drain the fruit, reserving the liquid. Cut half the butter into 1/2-inch
pieces and combine with the fruit. Stuff cavity of the turkey with most of
the fruit. Place the turkey in a roasting bag, arrange remaining fruit on
top of the bird and pour reserved orange juice-liquor mix over it. Combine
remaining tequila and Grand Marnier. Have ready a basting syringe fitted
with a metal injection nozzle and inject the mixture all over the turkey.
Melt remaining butter and carefully pour over the turkey in the roasting
bag. Seal bag and cut 1/4-inch slit on the top to let steam escape. Place
in a roasting pan and roast for 2 1/2 hours. Every 30 minutes open bag
(being careful to shield your face from steam) and inject more liquor,
eventually using it up. When ready to serve, slit open bag, arrange turkey
on a platter, and scoop out the fruit stuffing. Place all the fruit in a
serving bowl. Strain the juices that have accumulated in the bag, skim off

Title: ASPARAGUS WITH BLUE CHEESE - GGhol
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Asparagus; cleaned
2 ts Red wine vinegar
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Chives; minced
4 tb Blue cheese; crumbled
White pepper; freshly ground
Snap ends off asparagus spears.  Fill medium skillet with 1-inch water and
bring to a boil.  Add asparagus in single layer and cook 8 to 10 minutes or
until tender. Drain well and arrange on a serving plate. Stir together
vinegar and oil in sm bowl.  Add blue cheese and chives and mix well. Pour
over hot asparagus. Season to taste with plenty of white pepper. Set aside
until tepid, then serve.

Hint on cleaning asparagus:  Hold the bottom end of the stem in one hand
and gently bend the stalk with the other. The stalk will break where it is
tender, thus giving you a piece of asparagus that is entirely edible. With
a little practice you will know exactly where to break the vegetable. Save
the broken-off ends for soups. Slice and add to soup stock, then drain and
discard the coarse stalks before serving.
