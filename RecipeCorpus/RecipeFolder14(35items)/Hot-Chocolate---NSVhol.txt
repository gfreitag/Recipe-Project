Title: Hot Chocolate - NSVhol
Categories: Beverages, Nsv
Yield: 2 servings
1 pt Milk
3 oz Imported chocolate (milk
-chocolate or semi-sweet)
Pour 1/4 cup of the milk into a small, thick-bottomed pot.  Break the
chocolate into small bits and add to the milk in the pot.  Over very
low heat, let the chocolate melt, then pour in the rest of the milk, bit
by bit, whisking well with each addition.  When the chocolate is  melted
and the milk faintly steaming, remove from the heat, beat vigorously
with a whisk until frothy, and serve.
Variations: A small amount of chocolate-based liqueur, such as
Cheri-Suisse, Vandermint, or Droste Bittersweet is liked by some. Of
course, unsweetened baking chocolate can be used instead.  Use the same
proportion: 1 1/2 oz. chocolate per cup of milk and sweeten to taste.
