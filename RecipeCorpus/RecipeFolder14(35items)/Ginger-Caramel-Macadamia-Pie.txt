1 1/2 c  Macadamia nuts
-- (salted, roasted)
3 lg Eggs
1 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 c  Minced candied ginger

Fit pastry over bottom and press against sides of a plain or fluted 9-inch
tart pan with removable bottom; fold any excess pastry down to make flush

Pour nuts onto a towel and rub lightly to remove salt.  Lift nuts from
towel and put in pastry.

In a bowl, beat to blend eggs, sugar, candied ginger, fresh ginger, and
vanilla.  Pour evenly over nuts.

Title: Kourambiedes
Categories: Cookies, Greek
Yield: 50 servings
1 c  Sweet butter
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1    Egg yolk
2 tb Brandy or Cognac, (optional)
1 ts Almond extract
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 ts Baking powder
2 1/4 c  Sifted cake flour; (or more)
3/4 c  Ground almonds; toasted
1 lb Powdered sugar; sifted
In electric mixing bowl, whip the sweet butter until it is fluffy and
white.  Continuing to beat on medium speed, gradually add the 1/2 cup
powdered sugar, egg yolk, and flavorings.
Meanwhile, sift the baking powder with the flour and gradually add to
the batter, mixing by hand and working the flour thoroughly into the
mixture before adding more.  Mix in ground almonds.  Knead until a soft,
buttery dough is formed that will stay together when a little is rolled in
the palms of your hands.  Break off pieces slightly larger than a walnut,
then roll into balls, half-moons, or S-curves.  Place on cookie sheets
allowing an inch between each.  Bake on the center rack of a 350-degree
oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden colored, not chestnut.  Remove
from the oven and carefully lift each Kourambie and place on a generous
layer of sifted powdered sugar.  Immediately sift more powdered sugar over
to cover Kourambiedes.  Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before lifting
and rolling to be sure they are evenly coated.  May be served in
individual fluted paper cups.

Title: Cinnamon Shortbreads
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 24 pieces
100 g  Plain wholewheat flour
100 g  Plain white flour
50 g  Cornflour
50 g  Semolina or ground rice
2 ts Cinnamon (or more)
225 g  Soft butter or margarine
100 g  Caster sugar
Set the oven to 170 C (325 F, Gas Mark 3) and grease a 19 cm x 29 cm
(7-1/2 inch x 11-1/2 inch) shallow tin with butter.

Sift the flours, semolina or ground rice and cinnamon into a large bowl or
food processor, adding the residue of bran from the sieve.  Then put in
the butter or margarine and the sugar.  Whizz, or beat, all the
ingredients together until they form a soft dough which leaves the sides
of the bowl clean.

Press this into the tin, leveling the surface by pressing with the back of
a metal spoon.  Then prick the surface all over with a fork.  Bake for
about 45 minutes, until the shortbread is set and quite crispy on top and
very lightly tinged with gold.  It's more tricky to tell when these are
done than with normal shortbreads because they are already rather brown!
If you are in doubt, you can lift up one of the end pieces and look
underneath it to see if it looks done underneath.  If not, carefully put
it back and let the shortbread cook for a bit longer.  When it's done, cut
it into sections, if you haven't already done so, and leave it to cool and
crisp up in the tin.

This shortbread keeps well in a tin for several days, if it gets the
chance, and also freezes well.  It defrosts very quickly; you can use it
almost straight from the freezer.

Title: Gingerbread Teddy Bears
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 16 servings
1 c  Butter (or margarine)
2/3 c  Brown sugar
2/3 c  Corn syrup and/or molasses
4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Ground cloves
3/4 ts Baking soda
1    Egg; lightly beaten
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
In a saucepan combine butter, brown sugar and corn syrup. Cook and stir
over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Pour into large mixing bowl; cool
5 minutes. Sift together flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and baking soda.
Add egg and vanilla to butter mixture; mix well. Add flour mixture; beat
til well mixed. Divide dough in half, cover and chill 2 hours or
overnight.

For each bear, shape dough into one 1-inch ball, one 3/4-inch ball, six
1/2-inch balls and one 1/4-inch ball. On ungreased cookie sheet flatten
the 1-inch ball to 1/2" thickness for body. Attach the 3/4-inch ball for
head and flatten to 1/2" thickness. Attach the 1/2-inch balls for arms,
legs and ears. Attach the 1/4-inch ball for nose. Bake at 350 degrees for
8 to 10 minutes, cool and decorate.

I usually make these smaller than described here; about 1/2 the size.
Also, the ears start to look like MOUSE ears if they're not a little
smaller than the arms and legs. Roll the nose ball to make it more oval in
shape and place it on the LOWER half of the bear's face. These can be
decorated with any icing-- I use tinted Royal icing made from meringue
powder to add eyes, nose and bow tie to each bear.

For Easter, make these into bunnies. Use only light corn syrup, no
molasses. Substitute white sugar for the brown sugar. Omit spices and add
a bit of almond extract if desired. Make them the same way, but make two
long ears on the top and two cheek-balls instead of the nose-ball.
Decorate with pastel icings.

Title: Cranberry Fritters
Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian, Vegan
Yield: 4 servings
8 oz Cranberry jelly, canned
5 tb Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Sugar
5 tb Water
Vegetable oil
-- for deep-frying
Flour; for dredging
Cranberry tartness suggests the original Chinese ingredient, a firm,
gelatinous jelly flavored with the hawthorn berry (or 'shan dza',
which in northern China is pureed to make a delicious tart, thick,
cooling drink). Enclosed within a light, deep-fried batter, the
strips of jelly become hot and soft or, in the case of cranberry,
almost liquid.  Buy the "jellied cranberry sauce", not the
whole-berry type.

This recipe makes three to four small servings.

DIRECTIONS:
===========
Cut the jelly crosswise into three round slices, 1/2 inch thick.  Cut
each slice into three strips, approximately 1/2 x 1/2 x 2-1/2 inches.

Prepare a batter by blending the flour, baking powder, sugar, and
water.

Heat oil for deep-frying; after it is hot, keep the heat around
medium-high.  Dredge the cranberry jelly strips lightly in flour,
making sure all sides, including the ends, are dusted.  Then dip them
in the batter to coat completely, and immerse them in the oil until
golden brown. Fry only a few at a time.  Drain on paper toweling, and
eat while hot.
