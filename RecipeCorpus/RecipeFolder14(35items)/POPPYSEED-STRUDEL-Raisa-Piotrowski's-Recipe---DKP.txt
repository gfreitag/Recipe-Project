(100').
Now divide the dough in two balls, roll it out to about 1 finger
thickness, spread the poppyseed filling and roll together. You will have

Di Note:  I worked with Raisa when I was with CBS.  She had come over
from Russia and she and I would chat on the phone (she lived in
New York).  One day, I described this strudel thing and asked her
if she knew what it was and she sent me her recipe.  Very good.
