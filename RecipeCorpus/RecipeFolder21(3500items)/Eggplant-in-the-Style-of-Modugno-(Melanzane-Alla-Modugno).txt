Title: Eggplant in the Style of Modugno (Melanzane Alla Modugno)
Categories: Italian, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
1 lg Eggplant (about 2 lbs),
Sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch
Thick
1 tb Salt
2 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
2 ts Minced garlic (3 medium
Cloves)
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
1 3/4 c  Grated mozzarella cheese
(8 oz.)
1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
Cheese (2 oz.)
Freshly ground pepper
1 c  Marinara Sauce
1.  Layer the eggplant slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer
with the salt.  Set aside to drain for at least 1-1/2 hours.  Gently
squeeze out the excess liquid.  Pat dry with paper towels. 2. In a
large skillet, heat the olive oil over moderately high heat to 375F
or until a small bread cube browns in about 1 minute.  Add the
eggplant slices in small batches and fry, turning once, until golden
and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove with a slotted
spoon and drain on paper towels. 3. Preheat the oven to 375F.  In a
medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic, parsley, mozzarella
and all but 2 Tablespoons of the Parmesan. Stir in the egg and season
with salt and pepper. 4. Spoon 3/4 c. of the Marinara Sauce into a
nonreactive 8-by-12-inch baking pan. Spread about 1 Tablespoon of the
mozzarella mixture on each slice of eggplant, roll up and place seam
side down in the pan. Spoon the remaining 1/4 c. Marinara Sauce over
the eggplant rolls and sprinkle the reserved 2 Tablespoons Parmesan
on top. (This dish can be prepared to this point several hours ahead
and kept covered at room temperature.) Bake until the mixture bubbles
and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. Serve hot or at room
temperature. These eggplant rolls are from Apulia, the region that
forms the heel of the Italian boot.  They make a wonderful antipasto
or a delicious luncheon dish.  Serve at room temperature to enjoy
their fullest flavor.
