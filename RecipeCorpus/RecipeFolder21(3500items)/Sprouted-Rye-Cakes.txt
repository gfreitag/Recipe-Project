Title: Sprouted Rye Cakes
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 40 servings
2 c  Sprouted rye
1/4 ts Anise seeds, crushed with a
Rolling pin
1/4 ts Salt
1    Egg, lightly beaten
1 c  Flour
"Chewy and quite zesty, these flavorful Sprouted Rye Cakes are
excellent with cold corned beef or pastrami. 300~F. 35 to 40 minutes
Preheat the oven to 300~F.

Drain the sprouted rye very well. Finely chop it in the food
processor, blender, or by hand. (If you are using the blender, chop
the rye about 1/3 cup at a time.) Add the anise seeds and salt and
mix well. Blend in the egg.

Mix in enough flour to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball. The amount of flour needed will depend on how dry the
sprouts were after draining. This dough is very sticky, and you will
want to keep your fingers well-floured for the next operation.

Using two spoons, divide the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in
diameter. Place each ball on a lightly greased or parchment-lined
baking sheet. Mash the balls into flat circles with the well-floured
palm of your hand or the floured side of a glass.

Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, turning once after about 20 minutes, when
the bottoms have browned. Yield: 30-40.

VARIATIONS: Try other sprouted grains, such as wheat or oats.
