Title: Hamburgers with Goat Cheese
Categories: Beef, Cheese/eggs, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Ground beef, very lean
Salt and pepper
1/4 lb Goat cheese
1 tb Tarragon
1. Preheat the broiler to high. 2. Divide the beef into 4 portions.
Shape each portion into a patty about 1-in. thick. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper. 3. Place a wire rack in a baking dish and arrange the
patties on the rack. Put under the broiler, 1-2 in. from source of
heat and leave the broiler door slightly open. Cook about 3 min. on
the first side if you wish the meat to be rare. If you prefer it more
well done, cook up to 6 min. on the first side. Turn the patties and
continue cooking 2-4 min. 4. Meanwhile, crumble the cheese. 5. Top
each patty with an equal portion of cheese, pressing it down lightly
to keep it on the top of the meat. Return the cheese-topped patties
to the broiler and broil about 2 min. or until the cheese is browned
on top and partly melted. 6. Sprinkle with the tarragon.
