Categories: Fish
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  White vinegar
2 tb Wine vinegar
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 pt Water
1/2 ts Salt
1/2    Bay leaf
1    Clove
2    Peppercorns
1/4    Onion, chopped
1/4    Carrot, chopped
1/4    Celery heart, chopped
1 lb Fish bones and heads
2    Fresh brook trout
Combine all the ingredients except the trout and bring to a boil.
Lower the heat and simmer 20 minutes.  Strain the mixture through a
cheesecloth.
While the liquid is boiling, clean the fish.  Do not wash, and
handle as little as possible.
Bring the strained liquid to a boil, reduce the heat, add the trout
and simmer, uncovered, until the trout turns blue and the fish flakes
easily when tested with a fork, seven or eight minutes. Remove from
the liquid and serve with boiled potatoes. The New York Times
