Title: Succotash Snacks
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 55 servings
1 c  Lima bean flour (available
At health food or specialty
Stores)
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Corn meal
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
2/3 c  Water
"Lima beans and corn are a traditional combination which works very
well in these crispy thin crackers. Served with a hearty bowl of
soup, they are a lunch in themselves. 325~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat
the oven to 325~F.

Stir together the flours, corn meal, salt, and sugar in a large bowl
or in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
resembles coarse meal.

Blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together
in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 portions for rolling.
Roll out to 1/16 to 1/8 inch. Cut into 2-inch shapes and place on an
ungreased baking sheet. Prick each one 2 or 3 times with the tines of
a fork.

Bake for 15 minutes. Turn over and continue baking another 10 to 15
minutes, or until medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 50-55.

VARIATION: For a coarser texture and different taste, try substituting
whole millet for the corn meal.
