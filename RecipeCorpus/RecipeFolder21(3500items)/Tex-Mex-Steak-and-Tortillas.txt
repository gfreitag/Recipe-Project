Categories: Beef, Tex/mexican, Vegetable, Meat
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 lb Boneless sirloin each about
1/2-in. thick
1/2 c  Corn oil
3 ts Garlic, chopped
4 tb Red wine vinegar
1 lb Ripe tomatoes
1/2 c  Onion, chopped fine
1/4 c  Red chilies, chopped fine
1/4 c  Coriander, chopped fine
12    Flour tortillas
1. Prepare a very hot charcoal fire. 2. There should be about 6
individual steaks. Cut each of these in half. Blend the oil, 2 tsp
garlic ans 3 tbsp vinegar in a flat dish. Add the steaks, turning to
coat the pieces well. Set aside. 3. Core the tomatoes but do not peel
them. Cut them into 1/4-in. cubes and put them in a mixing bowl. Add
the onion, chilies, coriander, remaining garlic and vinegar. Blend
well. Set this sauce aside. 4. Put about 4 slices of steak at a time
on the hot grill and cook for 1 min. or less to a side, depending on
the desired degree of doneness. Simultaneously, add a similar number
of tortillas and cook them for a few sec. to a side just to heat
through. Do not heat for for long or they will dry out. 5. Place one
piece of steak in the center of a warm tortilla, spoon a little sauce
over the meat and fold the side of the tortilla over the ends up to
enclose the meat. Eat like a sandwich.
