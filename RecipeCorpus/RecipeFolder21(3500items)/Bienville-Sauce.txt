BIENVILLE SAUCE

Heat butter in heavy pot. Add flour and cook slowly for 3 minutes.
(Do not brown roux.) Add fish stock and whip vigorously for 1 minute,
then simmer for 1/2 hour. Stir occasionally. Next, add trout, shrimp
and egg yolks, mix with cream and beat vigorously for 4 minutes. Add
Chablis and beat 1 more minute. Refrigerate at least 1/2 hour.

member of the weakfish family, a sweet semi-firm fleshed fish.]
