Title: Yogurt Thins
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 85 servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Oil
1/2 c  Plain, unsweetened yogurt
"The flavor of these crispy snacks varies subtly with the type of
yogurt used. A bit of sweet jam or honey complements these somewhat
tangy crackers. They are also excellent with almost any dip.

15 to 20 minutes
325~ F

Preheat the oven to 325~ F.

In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.
Add the oil and mix until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the
yogurt and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball. If necessary, add an addional Tablespoon of yogurt.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll in a rectangular shape 1/8 inch thick.
Using a spatulay, rolling pin, or your hands, pick up the rolled
dough and transfer it to a large baking sheet.

With a sharp knife, score the surface into 2-inch squares, taking
care not to cut all the way through the dough. Prick each square in 2
or 3 places with the tines of a fork.

Baike for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Turn over once
during baking and pull off any individual crackers at the edges that
are already brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 80-85.

VARIATIONS: A sweeter cracker will result by substituting sweetened
yogurt for the plain yogurt. Lemon and berry flavors are good. If you
use fruit-at-the-bottom yogurt, be sure to stir it first. Note that
the color can be affected by the type of yogurt used.

Substituting 1/3 cup toasted wheat germ for the same amount of flour
lends this cracker a nutty flavor.
