Title: Hijiki Nimono
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 oz Hijiki
2 oz Carrots
1    Age (deep-fried tofu) puff
1/3    Block hard tofu
5    Green beans
2 tb Sesame oil
1 c  Dashijiru (soup stock)
3 tb Shoyu (soy sauce)
2 tb Sake
2 tb Mirin
1 ts White sesame seeds
-- lightly sauteed
Seven pepper; to taste
- (Shichimitogarashi)
A.)   Rinse the hijiki in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running
water. In 3 times the amount of warm water, soak for 10 to 15
minutes.  Remove the hijiki with a tea strainer.  (Sand and pebbles
will sink to the bottom of the bowl.)  Return to fine-mesh strainer
and drain off excess water. Grate the carrots into matchstick
slivers.  Dip the age puff for 30 seconds in boiling water, and cut
into matchstick slivers.  Place tofu in a heated skillet and mash
with a spatula.  Let it simmer in its own water until reduced to
small crumbs.  Snap the ends off the green beans and place in boiling
water for 1 to 2 minutes.  Immerse in iced water, drain, and cut into
1/2-inch-long pieces.

B.)   In a heated skillet, saute sesame oil, hijiki, carrots, age,
and tofu (all completely drained of water).  When ingredients have
acquired a shiny appearance, add dashijiru, shoyu, sake and mirin.
Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has
been absorbed.  Turn off heat and add green beans.

C.)   Place B in serving dish, sprinkle with sauteed sesame seeds.
If you like, add seven-taste pepper to taste.
