Title: Filo Mushroom Pies
Categories: Appetizer, British
Yield: 42 servings
1 pk Filo pastry sheets
3/4 lb Flat mushrooms (w/o stalks)
1/2 lb Onions
7 oz Feta cheese
2 ts Whole cumin
2 ts Coriander seeds
- toasted & lightly crushed
Butter or oil
2 sm Eggs
Chop the onion finely and soften it in a little butter or oil, then
fry hard until frazzled.  Remove and reserve.  Dice the mushrooms and
fry them in the fat remaining in the pan; stir and turn them as
necessary to drive off most of their moisture and to concentrate
flavour.  Mix the two vegetables together and season with plenty of
salt and pepper.  Stir in the cumin, coriander and grated cheese.
When cool bind with the beaten eggs.

Unwrap the pastry one sheet at a time.  Keep the rest covered with a
damp cloth to prevent drying out.  Cut each sheet into strips about 3
x 10 inches long and brush on one side only with melted butter.  Put
one rounded metal teaspoonful of the mixture near the short edge of
the buttery side of the first pastry strip - about 1 inch from the
bottom and slightly to the left-hand side.  Fold the bottom
right-hand corner of the pastry diagonally over the filling to make a
triangle.  Continue folding the pastry at right angles up the whole
lenghth of the strip so you end up with a neat little triangular
parcel.  Make more little pies in the same way until all the filling
is used up.

To cook, simply brush the pies all over with melted butter or oil,
arrange them side by side on baking trays and bake at 350-375 F
(180-190 C) gas mark 4/5 for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is
golden and crisp.  It is best to turn the pies over after the first
10 minutes and brush with more butter or oil.  For even crisper
results the pies can be deep-fried.
