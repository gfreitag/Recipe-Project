1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Pure maple syrup

The night before serving, dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water.  Add
warm milk, flour and salt.  Mix into a smooth batter.  Cover loosely

before cooking, mix in maple syrup, baking soda dissolve in hot
water, and melted butter. Stir in walnuts.  Heat 2 teaspoons butter
in a skillet or on a griddle until it foams.  Scoop 1/4 cup batter
onto hot surface for each pancake. Cook over moderate heat until the
pancake is covered with bubbles. Flip and cook another minute or two,
until pancake feels spring. Keep warm while preparing the rest of the
pancakes, greasing the pan with more butter for every batch. Serve
with syrup, fruit and honey or flavoured butter. Makes 12 pancakes.
