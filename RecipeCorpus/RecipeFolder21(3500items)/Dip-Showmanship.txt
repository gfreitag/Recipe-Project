To dress up dips in holiday style, serve them with festive flair.
Leave your serving bowls on the shelf and try one of these fresh
ideas.

PARTY-PERFECT PEPPER POTS: Start with a large red, yellow or green
pepper. Place the pepper on its side and cut a large slice from the
top, forming an opening that's large enough to dip into easily.
Remove the seeds and membranes and fill the pepper with your favorite
dip.

COLORFUL CABBAGE CUPS: Cut a thin slice off the stem end of a red or
green cabbage so it will be upright. Using a small, sharp knife, cut
a "bowl" in the top of the cabbage and tuck in a small glass bowl.
Fill the bowl with your favorite. Save the cabbage you've removed for
coleslaw, or toss it into a salad.

BEAUTIFUL BREAD BOWL: Cut a thick slice off the top of a small round
loaf of bread and hollow out the bread, leaving a 1/2-1" thick shell.
Fill the bread bowl with your favorite dip. Cut the top slice and the
bread you've removed from the inside into bite-size cubes to use as
dippers. Works great with classic Pace Con Queso Dip.
