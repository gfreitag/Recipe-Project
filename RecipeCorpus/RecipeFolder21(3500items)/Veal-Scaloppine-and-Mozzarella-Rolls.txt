Categories: Italian, Veal
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Can imported tomatoes
8    Slices scaloppine of veal
1/2 ts Finely chopped rosemary
Salt and pepper
1/4 lb Mozzarella chesse
2 tb Olive oil
2    Cloves garlic,minced
1/4 c  Dry white wine
3 tb Chopped parsley
1/4 c  Grated parm cheese
1. Place the tomatoes in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Let
cook until thickened and reduce to 3 cups. 2. Pound the meat lightly
with a flat mallet without breaking the fibers. Place the slices on a
flat surface and sprinkle with rosemary, and salt and pepper to
taste. Cut the mozzarella into 8 thin "fingers" of equal size. Place
one finger in the center of each veal slice. Fold over the edges,
then roll, envelope fashion, to enclose the cheese. Tie each roll
neatly with string in two places. 3. Preheat the oven to 400. 4. Heat
the oil in a heavy skillet. Add the veal rolls and brown quickly and
evenly over high heat, about 4 min. Transfer the rolls to a baking
dish and remove the string. 5. To the skillet add the garlic and cook
briefly. Add the wine and stir to dissolve the brown particles that
cling to the bottom and sides of the pan. Add the cooked down
tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 5 in.,then stir in the
parsley. 6. Pour the tomato sauce over the veal rolls and sprinkle
with parm cheese. Bake 10-15 min. until piping hot.

A nice dry red wine that goes with this meal would be Valpolicella or
Bardolino.
