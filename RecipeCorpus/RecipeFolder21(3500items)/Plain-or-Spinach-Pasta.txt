I make my pasta in the food processor with the steel blades. I put my
flour in first and spin. Then I drizzle the beaten eggs through the
tube. I let it run until the dough cleans the bowl. For a spinach
pasta, I put the spinach in with the flour and spin for about a
minute before adding the eggs.
Note from MK: I use the same recipe and method, using large eggs
and unbleached flour.
