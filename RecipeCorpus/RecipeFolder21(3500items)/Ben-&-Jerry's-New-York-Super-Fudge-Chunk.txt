Categories: Ice cream, Chocolate, Dessert, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  White chocolate; chop coarse
1/4 c  Semisweet chocoate; chop
1/4 c  Pecan halves; chopped
1/4 c  Walnuts; chop coarse
1/4 c  Chocolate covered almonds;
- cut in half
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1 c  Milk
2 lg Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Heavy or whipping cream
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 pn Salt
Combine the coarsely chopped chocolate, pecans, walnuts and chocolate
covered almonds in a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Melt the unsweetened
chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling water.
Whisk in the milk, a little at a time, and heat, stirring constantly,
until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool. Whisk the eggs in a
mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar,
a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended,
about 1 minute more. Add the cream, vanilla and salt and whisk to
blend. Pour the chocolate mixture into the cream mixture and blend.
Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1-3 hours, depending on your
refrigerator. Transfer the cream mixture to an ice cream maker and
freeze following the manufacturer's instructions. After the ice cream
stiffens (about 2 minutes before it is done), add the chocolate and
nuts, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready.

Makes one Generous Quart. Note: "New York Super Fudge Chunk was
developed as a regional flavor for the sophisticated New York palate.
After coming up with several variations in our Burlington lab,we
packed the samples in dry ice and shipped them by bus to our New york
consultants, a group of musicians on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Following several weeks of refinement and discussion, we all agreed
on this final recipe- a chocolate lover's dream."
