until the leaves come off. Cut off the hard stem parts, and put the
leaves in boiling salted water one at a time until they are partialy
cooked.

Mix the meat, bread, salt, pepper, egg and onion together. Make a
white gravy out of the margarine, flour, water, and milk. Season with
salt and pepper and add capers. You can also use tomato sauce for a
change.

Grease the bottom and sides of a large casserole dish. Layer in the
cabbage, meat and gravy alternately. Top with cabbage. Cover and bake
