Title: Hot-And-Spicy Short Ribs
Categories: Asian, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Beef short ribs *
*cut in 1-in lengths
4    Garlic cloves
- peeled and minced
2    1-in cubes ginger
- peeled and minced
3 md Scallions; trimmed & minced
2/3 c  Soy sauce
2 tb Sesame oil
1 1/2 ts Spicy sesame oil
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Cider vinegar
1 tb Mirin (sweet rice wine)
1/4 tb Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Toasted sesame seeds
TOAST THE SESAME SEEDS by spreading them over the bottom of a pie tin.
Roast them at 300F for 12-to-16 minutes. Stir sesame seeds often,
until they are golden. With a very sharp knife, score the meat on
each short rib in a crisscross pattern, making the cuts about
3/8-inch apart and cutting almost to the bone. This will allow the
marinade to penetrate and help tenderize the meat. Place the short
ribs in a large shallow baking pan. Combine the rest of the
ingredients, pour the marinade over the meat and toss well to mix.
Cover and refrigerate the ribs for 24 hours, turning them in the
marinade several times. When you are ready to cook the short ribs,
preheat the oven to 325F. Arrange the ribs on a rack in a shallow
roasting pan. Brush ribs with a little of the marinade. Roast them
uncovered for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, turn the ribs
and brush them with the marinade. Raise the oven temperature to 500F.
After the ribs have stood for 10 minutes at room temperature, return
them to the oven and roast them for 5 minutes. Turn them again, baste
them lavishly with the marinade and roast them for 3 to 5 minutes
longer for rare, about 8 minutes for medium-rare. Brush the ribs with
any remaining marinade and serve them with fluffy boiled rice and a
crisp salad.
