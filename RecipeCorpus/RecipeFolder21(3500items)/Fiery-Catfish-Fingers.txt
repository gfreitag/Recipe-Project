In the South Folks grow up loving catfish, which is plentiful in the
bayous and rivers.  Now it's farm-grown, and northerners are
discovering its mild and versatile flavor.  We coat bite-size fingers
of catfish fillets with plenty of Tabasco sauce and deep-fry them for
a knock-your-socks-off appetizer.
~---------------------------------------------------------------------
~-- In a large bowl, stir together the mustard, egg white and Tabasco
sauce. Add the fish and toss to coat well.  Cover and marinate for 1
hour.

In a shallow dish, mix together the cornmeal, flour, salt and pepper.
Pour the oil into a heavy 3 quart saucepan or deep-fryer, filling it
no more than one-third full, and heat over medium heat to 350oF.
Dredge the fish in the cornmeal mixture and shake off the excess.
Carefully add the fish to the oil, a few pieces ata time.  Cook for 2
minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.  Drain on paper towels.
Serve the catfish hot with spicy mayonnaise or picante sauce.  From:
