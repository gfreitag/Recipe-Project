Title: Sprout, Bean & Vegetable Stew
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Yellow lentils
1/3 ts Turmeric
1 lb Brussels sprouts
1/4 lb Green beans, sliced
1 tb Tamarind paste
3 tb Light vegetable oil
3/4 ts Black mustard seeds
1/4 ts Fenugreek seeds
2 ts Chopped garlic
1 tb Sambaar powder
2 ts Salt
2 tb Coriander leaves, chopped
Wash lentils.  Put in a large pot with turmeric & 4 cups of water.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat & simmer, partially covered, for 30
minutes.  Add another 3/4 cups water & continue to simmer for another
30 minutes.  Stir often to prevent burning.  You should have a stiff
puree.  Set aside.

While lentils are cooking, wash vegetables & dry.  Prepare sprouts as
you would for any cooking.  Heat oil in a deep saucepan & when very
hot, add mustard seeds.  After 15 seconds, add fenugreek.  Then add
garlic & sambaar powder.  Stir for a moment & add sprouts & beans.
Fry the vegetables, turning & tossing them for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add
tamarind paste, salt & 1/4 cup warm water.  Reduce heat & cook,
covered, for 20 minutes. Add lentils to the vegetables.  Cook for
another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are completely
cooked. Stir in coriander & serve with plain cooked rice.
