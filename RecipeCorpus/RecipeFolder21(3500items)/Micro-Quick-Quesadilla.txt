cook several at one time, increase the cooking time a bit.

Place tortilla on microwave-safe plate or paper plate. Microwave at
HIGH 10 seconds or until just softened. Top with cheese, Pace Picante
Sauce and, if desired, optional toppings. Fold in half and microwave
on HIGH 30 seconds or until cheese melts. Let stand a minute or two
before serving; cheese will be very hot. Top with guacamole, if
desired, and serve with additional Pace Picante Sauce.
