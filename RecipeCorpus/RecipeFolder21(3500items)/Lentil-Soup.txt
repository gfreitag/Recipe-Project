Contributed to the echo by: Larry Maki Originally from: "McCall's Cook
Book" Lentil Soup Ellen, I have been making lentil soup for years and
have found this to be one of the best tasting basic lentil soup
recipes I have yet come across. It was originally from the 'McCall's
Cook Book' but has been modified slightly. Hope you enjoy it!

Put lentils in 5 cups cold water in a large kettle and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Meanwhile, cut the
bacon in small pieces and saute, in a large skillet, until crisp.
Discard half of the bacon fat. (Only discard half or less or the soup
will not taste complete). To the bacon in the skillet, add the onion,
carrot, pepper and tomato and saute over low heat for 5 minutes.
Combine with the lentils in the kettle.

Melt butter or margarine in the same skillet and remove from heat.
Slowly stir in the flour until smooth then gradually stir in the
bouillon. Add salt and vinegar and bring to a boil while stirring.

Pour into lentils and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for
about 30 minutes.

Serve and enjoy!
