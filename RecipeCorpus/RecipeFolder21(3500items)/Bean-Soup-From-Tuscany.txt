Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Dried cannellini beans
2    Red onions
10    Sprigs fresh parsley leaves
1 lg Celery stalk
2 cl Garlic, peeled
1 tb Fresh basil
1 ts Fresh rosemary leaves
Coarse grained salt
3    Fresh tomatos OR
3    Drained canned imported
Italian tomatos
1 oz Boiled ham
1 oz Salt pork
1/4 c  Plus 8 ts olive oil
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper
1/2 ts Dried thyme OR
1/2 ts Tarragon
1 sm Savoy cabbage, (2 lbs)
8    Slices coarse Italian bread
Soak the beans overnight in cold water; rinse and drain. Coarsely
chop one onion, parsley, celery, garlic, basil and rosemary. Place in
stockpot. Add beans, coarse-grain salt to taste and 5 quarts of cold
water. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat, then simmer for
about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, finely chop the remaining onion, chop
up the tomatos in a food processor and cut the ham and salt pork into
small pieces. Heat 1/4 cup of the oil and lightly saute the onion,
ham and salt pork for about 10 minutes, then add the tomatos. Taste
for salt and pepper and add the thyme or tarragon. Simmer for about
10 minutes, then set aside. Clean and wash the cabbage. Cut into
1/2-inch strips. When the beans have finished cooking, remove about
half the beans and vegetables with a slotted spoon and puree in a
food processor. Return the puree to the stockpot and add enough cold
water to make about 4 quarts liquid and bring to a boil. Add cabbage
and simmer about 25 minutes, then add tomatos and meat to the
stockpot and simmer 5 minutes longer. Toast the slices of bread and
place in each individual soup bowl. Ladle the soup over the bread and
serve, adding a ts of olive oil to each serving. NOTE: Dried herbs
may be substituted for fresh using 1/3 to 1/2 ts dried for each Tb
fresh, or to taste.
