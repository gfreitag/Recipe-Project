Times Pork Chops with Apples and Sweet and Sour Sauce

Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper to taste and set aside. Cut the
Apples into quarters. Peel the quarters and discard the core. Dredge
the chops in flour. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet, and add
the chops. Cook until well browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn
the chops and continue cooking about 5 minutes. Remove the chops, and
add the quartered apples. Cook about 2 minutes turning the apples
often. Remove the apples and pour off the fat from the skillet. Add
the shallots and vinegar and cook briefly, stirring with a wooden
spoon. Add the broth and honey. Cook 1 minute and stir in the tomato
paste. Return the chops and apples to the skillet. Spoon sauce over
them, and cover closely. Cook ten minutes, and serve chops covered
with sauce.
