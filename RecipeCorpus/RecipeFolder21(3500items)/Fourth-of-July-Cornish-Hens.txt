Contributed to the echo by: Ellen Cleary Originally from: local New
Oreleans newspaper Fourth of July Cornish Hens Blend garlic, seasoned
salt, oil, lemon juice, dressing, onions, pepper, and thyme. Marinate
the birds overnight in the refrigerator.

Cut the birds lengthwise. Cook on outside grill bone side down 10
minutes, flesh side down 5 minutes, alternating 10 minutes and 5
minutes in this manner for 1 hour and basting with marinade
frequently (at least every 5 minutes) while cooking.

Serves 8 polite people or 6 of us.

Oven method: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place skin side up in a
shallow pan, baste with marinade, cover with foil and roast for 30
minutes. Remove foil and brush with marinade again. Roast again
uncovered for 20-30 minutes. (Test for doneness: drumsticks should be
soft and juices should not be tinged with pink when you pierce the
thickest part of the thigh with a fork. Brush with marinade twice
more during this second roasting period.
