PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch oven-proof glass or
earthenware casserole dish. Make an incision along the length of each
bell pepper and remove the stem, seeds and membranes, keeping the
peppers whole. Fill a medium-size saucepan or skillet halfway with
water and bring it to a boil. Add the peppers, let the water return
to a boil and cook until the peppers are just softened, about 3
minutes. Remove and blot them very dry with paper towels. Let them
cool completely and then line the bottom of the casserole with them.
Separate the eggs into 2 large bowls. Beat the yolks until smooth,
then stir in the cheese, corn, milk, jalapeno peppers and salt and
black pepper. Whisk the whites until soft peaks form, then fold them
into the yolk mixture, gently stirring just until almost blended.
Scrape the mixture into the prepared dish and transfer it to the
middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake just until the eggs are puffy
and the top is lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to
325F and continue cooking until the eggs are baked through but not
dry, 22 to 25 minutes. Test by inserting a knife into the center. It
should come out almost clean. Remove the pan and let it sit for a few
minutes before cutting the casserole into 12 rectangles. Serve each
portion with some salsa spooned on top.
