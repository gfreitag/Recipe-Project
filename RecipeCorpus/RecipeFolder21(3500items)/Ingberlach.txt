1 lb Honey
1/2 lb Coarse matzah meal or matzah
1/2 ts Ginger
Sugar or  matzah meal
Here is the recipe I think that you are looking for. It is called
INGBERLACH and this recipe is from Passoverama, a cookbook for
Passover. The cookbook is from Temple Beth Hillel-Beth El in
Wynnewood, Pa.

Boil ingredients together in a large saucepan until the mixture is
thick and forms a ball. (Mixture should retain shape when dropped in
a glass of cold water) Roll small amounts on board covered with sugar
or matzah meal. Roll into heavy cigar shapes (3" long) or flatten
with palm of the hand to 1/2" thicknesses and cut into diamond or
square shapes. I hope that this helps and is what you have been
loooking for.
