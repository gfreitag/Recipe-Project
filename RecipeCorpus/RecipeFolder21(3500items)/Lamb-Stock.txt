Title: Lamb Stock
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
1    Bone from a 6-lb leg of
Lamb, cut in half
3    Stalks celery, cut into
Small pieces
2    Carrots, cut into small
Pieces
2    Onions, peeled and
Quartered
1 lg Ripe tomato OR
1 c  Canned tomato, cut into
Small pieces
Any drippings from roast
Lamb
4    Peppercorns
1    Bay leaf
1    Parsley
add enough water to just cover the lamb bone.  Bring to a boil over
high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer, partially covered, 1 to 2
hours, or until the stock is somewhat reduced and flavorful. If it
tastes weak, simply raise the heat a bit and let it reduce further.

2.  Drain the stock into a colander set over a large bowl. Remove
the bones and cut any remaining meat off and set aside. Discard the
vegetables and bones.  Remove any fat that has floated to the top.
The stock can then be refrigerated or frozen, or used right away to
make a soup.

Makes about 8 cups.
