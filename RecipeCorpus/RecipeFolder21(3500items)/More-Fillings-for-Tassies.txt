I haven't made these lemon ones yet, but I scaled down a larger
recipe from some cookbook to resemble the pecan tassie proportions,
hoping to have enough lemon filling for a batch of tartlets. So it
may or may not be enough, thought I'd let ya know.

LEMON TASSIE FILLING

In a small saucepan over low heat, cook the 1 st three until
dissolved. Beat the eggs with a mixer and add the hot mix very
slowly, mixing constantly. Then return mix to the saucepan and cook
for about 3 minutes until it's of pudding consistency. Stir in lemon
peel. Let cool to room temp. Fill each tartlet with about 2 tsps of
the lemon mix. Bake at 350 F for 20-25 mins., or until golden.

The back of the tart tamper package also suggested some other
fillings, like cherry or blueberry pie filling, or vanilla pudding
topped afterwards with a strawberry or a few blueberries (glaze with
some heated currant jelly).
