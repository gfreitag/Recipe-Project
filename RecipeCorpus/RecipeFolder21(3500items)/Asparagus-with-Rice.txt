Soak and rinse the asparagus. Cut off the tips and put aside. Boil the
stalks in lightly salted water. When tender, press the stalks through
a sieve and return the pulp to the cooking water. Keep hot. Finely
chop the onioin. Melt the butter in a saucepan and gently fry the
onion and the asperagus tips for a few minutes. Add the rice, mixing
and turning with a wooden spoon until the grains are coated in the
fat. Pour the wine over the rice, raise the heat and boil briskly
until the wine has evaporated. Dilute the bouillon cube and the meat
extract in the hot asperagus water. Add a little of the liquid to the
rice, lower the heat, stir and add more liquid as it reduces, until
the rice is al dente. Adjust the seasoning if necessary, glaze the
rice with 1 tbsp butter and add the grated cheese. Stir well and
serve immediately.
