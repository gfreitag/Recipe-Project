Title: Tempeh Mock Chicken Salad
Categories: Salad, Appetizer, Vegetarian
Yield: 3 servings
6 oz Tempeh
1/4 c  Mayonnaise*
1    Celery stalk, finely chopped
2 tb Minced dill pickle
2 tb Minced onion
2 tb Minced fresh parsley
1 ts Prepared mustard
1 ts Soy sauce
1 ds Garlic powder
Steam tempeh for 20 minutes.  Allow to cool enough to handle.  Cut
into cubes slightly smaller than 1/2 inch.  Combine with remaining
ingredients & mix lightly.  Serve on a bed of lettuce or as a
sandwich filling.

* I use tofu based mayonnaise, blend the tofu well with a touch of
salt & pepper, lemon juice & a crushed garlic clove.
