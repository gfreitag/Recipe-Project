Title: Ham Rolls with Grapes and Tomato Cream Sauce
Categories: Pork, Salsa/sauce, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Butter
1 tb Shallots, chopped fine
1 c  Cubed ripe tomatoes
6 tb Dry white wine
1 c  Heavy cream
1 lb Thinly sliced ham
1 1/2 c  Small white seedless grapes
1. Preheat the oven to 400. 2. Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a saucepan
and add the shallots. Cook briefly, then add the tomatoes. Cook about
10 min., stirring occasionally. Add 4 tbsp of the wine and cook about
3 min. Stir in the cream. Simmer about 15 min. 3. Butter a oval
baking dish( a dish measuring about 9 x 12 x 2 in. is ideal). Roll up
the ham slices into cigarette shapes not quite 1-in. in diameter.
Arrange the rolls close together in the dish, side by side in a neat
row. Melt the remaining butter and brush over the ham rolls. Set
aside. 4. Put the sauce through a fine strainer. Return to the
saucepan and cook about 5 min. longer. 5. Meanwhile, place the grapes
in a small skillet with the remaining wine. Bring to a boil and cook,
shaking the skillet, about 3 min. Do not over cook or the grapes will
become mushy. They must retain a nice texture and shape. Add the
sauce and bring to a boil, stirring. 6. Place the ham in the oven and
bake about 5 min., just to heat through. 7. Pour the grapes and the
sauce over the ham.
