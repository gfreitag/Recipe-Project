1/2 ts Black pepper

"These buttery crackers have a shortbread-like texture. The use of
both cashew butter and chopped cashews brings forth the rich and
subtly sweet flavor of this nut to creat a truly elegant cracker.
350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

To prepare the lemon zest, lightly grate the skin of a firm lemon
against the fine grate of a cheese grater. Use only the colored part
of the rind; the underlying white portion is bitter.

In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the lemon zest,
flour, salt, pepper, and sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture
is the consistency of coarse meal. Mix in the cashew butter, chopped
cashews, and water, stirring until a smooth dough forms. Wrap the
dough in wax paper and chill 1 hour.

Once chilled, divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a
floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to approximately 1/4 inch
thick. With a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares and transfer to an
ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden
brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 30-35.
