2 c  Cake flour
6    Eggs
2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  CRISCO
Cream Crisco & sugar together.  Add eggs one at a time. Add flour &
vanilla.  Bake at 325 degrees approximately 1 hour 20 minutes or
longer in tube pan. Cool in pan at least 10 minutes.
NOTE: You must use CRISCO. Nothing else makes the top crunchy.
The middle of the cake dents in a little, so don't think the cake has
fallen or flopped. Formatted by Elaine Radis; 8/92
