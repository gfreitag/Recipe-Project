Categories: Jewish, Bread, Dessert
Yield: 40 servings
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
4 1/2 c  Flour
1 lb Honey
8    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Ginger
Mix eggs, flour and baking powder and knead well.  Dough should be
soft but stiff enough to roll.  Roll  with hands by bits into long
ropes 1/2" in diameter.  Use very little flour in rolling to avoid
toughness.  Slice in 1/2" lengths.  Heat oven to 350 F.  While oven
is heating, bring to boil the honey, ginger and sugar in a shallow
broad bottmed pan.  Put into this the pieces of dough.  Then place
pan into oven.  Do not open oven for first 15 or 20 min.  By this
time the honey will have coated each piece of dough. Now, stir every
10 min. to prevent the pieces from sticking to each other. Takes abt.
an hour for baking.  Pieces should be brown and when tested in cold
water should remain firm and crisp.  Pour onto moistened board,
flatten, sprinkle nuts on top and cut into squares. Makes 40 pcs. and
will keep.
