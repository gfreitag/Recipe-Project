Each of the three grain combinations can be formed using timbales or
other molds, or by the quenelle method using two large tablespoons.

COUSCOUS, RICE AND QUINOA:  Heat all couscous ingredients in a double
boiler until warmed through.  Pack mixture into 6 small timbale molds
(or scoop mixture in a tablespoon, round a second tablespoon over the
mixture and press spoons together).  Unmold mixture and set aside.

Repeat procedure with basmati rice ingredients; set aside.

Repeat with quinoa ingredients; set aside.

COULIS:  Grill, broil or roast corn in their husks for 10 to 12
minutes, until corn is cooked.  Discard husks and remove kernels from
cobs.  In a food processor blend kernels with enough water to produce
a sauce.  Pass mixture through a fine strainer, and season the liquid
with salt and pepper.

TO SERVE:  Pour coulis on 6 plates and place one serving of each
grain on each plate.  Garnish couscous with fried sage leaves;
garnish basmati rice with fried zucchini.

NOTES: To make tomato concasse, peel, seed and dice tomatoes and toss
with olive oil, salt and pepper.

To make shiitake duxelles, finely mince mushrooms and saute in oil
with a pinch of minced shallot or onion.

To fry sage leaves and zucchini for the garnishes, heat 3/4 inch of
oil in a pan to 350 F (a drop of water should ripple and pop on
surface of the oil); fry sage leaves for 1 minute, remove to a paper
towel and drain.	Repeat with finely julienned zucchini, frying just
until golden.
