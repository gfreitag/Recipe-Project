Title: Webster's North Carolina Bbq Ribs
Categories: Meat, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 c  Water
12 ts Powdered mustard
3 ts Black pepper
1 ts Chili powder
1 c  Vinegar
6 ts Salt
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Ground cumin
This is enough sauce for 9 lbs. of ribs (for 6 persons) allowing 1
1/2 lbs of pork ribs per person.
Adjust the fire to a "five-second" temperature; that is, you
should be able to hold you hand where the meat will be for 5 seconds.
Cooking Time:  Skinny ribs-50 min.; average ribs-60 min.; meaty
ribs- 70 min.  Every 2-3 minutes, stir the sauce to keep it from
settling, baste the ribs and turn them.  The sauce should run out 4-6
min. before the end or the cooking time so that the last turn on each
side should be "dry." Check the temperature frequently and keep it as
even as possible for the entire cooking time.  A covered grill is
desirable for temperature controll and also improves the flavor by
smoking the meat as the the cooking proceeds. Thee success of this
recipe depends on slow cooking at a moderate temperature, with
frequent basting.  Grease flare-ups should be suppressed with water
to avoid charring.
In some parts of North Carolina, a liquid resembling water is used
for refreshment, fueling cars and other purposes.  Do not
accidentally use it for suppressing the fire unless you want to
finish your meal in Georgia.
