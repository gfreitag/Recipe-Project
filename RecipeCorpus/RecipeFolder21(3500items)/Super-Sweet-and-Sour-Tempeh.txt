Mix water*, salt (reduce if you want), coriander & garlic in a bowl.
Dip tempeh chunks into bowl & then coat with cornstarch.  Deep fry in
hot oil till golden brown.  Drain on paper towels & set aside.

SAUCE: Heat oil in skillet & saute onion for 4 to 5 minutes.  Add
water, honey, soy sauce, vinegar, tahini, ginger & green onion.
Bring to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tb water & stir into sauce.
Stir till thickened. Place tempeh chunks into the sauce & cook
briefly over low heat till heated through.  Serve over rice or pasta.

* I usually save the mixture that I've used to dip the tempeh chunks
& add enough water to make up to 1/2 cup.
