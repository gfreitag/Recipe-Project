This is not the usual oat gruel, but a fresh white cheese, naturally
soured, or turned with rennet.  It needs a little livening - with
herbs or spark it up with wild garlic.

Heat the milk (100 F, 40 C).  Stir in the rennet.  Leave in a warm
place until the milk junkets.  Line a sieve with muslin wrung out in
boiling water. Set over a bowl and let it drain until crumbly.  Work
in the seasoning, herbs and butter.  Yields 5-6 oz.
