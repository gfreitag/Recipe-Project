American-Stateman", May 1990 Pepper Shells With Potatoes Dice
potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes. Cut off top of each pepper to make
shells about 2 inches high. Remove seeds, keeping shells intact. Then
tops; set aside. Par-boil shells in boiling salted water for 3
minutes and turn upside down to drain.

In a large frying pan, melt margarine over medium-high heat. Add
onion, potatoes, and chopped pepper; cook, turning until golden brown
(about 8 to 10 minutes). Add coriander, cumin, mustard seeds,
turmeric, salt and pepper during the last few minutes. Remove from
heat and sprinkle with lemon juice.

Arrange shells in a shallow, greased, baking dish. Pile potatoes into
shells. Bake uncovered in a 350 degree F. oven 20 minutes.

Makes 6 servings.
