Title: Cantaloupe Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
4    Cantaloupes
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
Fresh mint leaves about
One good size handful plus
Some for garnish
Port
Lemon juice
Carefully cut three of the cantaloupes in half in a zig-zag pattern
using a very sharp knife. Scoop out and throw away the seeds. Use a
melon ball scooper to scoop out the flesh of the melon; Take it down
to the green part. Do the same thing with the remaining fourth
cantaloupe. It doesn't matter how you slice this one because all you
will be using is the flesh. Place all of the scooped cantaloupe in a
food processor. Add the sugar and mint leaves, a splash of port and
splash of lemon juice. Be careful not to over-process the mixture; it
should retain some texture. Garnish with remaining mint leaves.
