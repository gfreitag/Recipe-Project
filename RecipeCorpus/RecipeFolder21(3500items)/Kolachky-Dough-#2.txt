Dough #2 Mix yeast in water and stir in 3 tablespoons flour. Let
stand for one hour. Beat eggs, sugar, butter and shortening until
creamy. Add to yeast mixture. Blend in sour cream and vanilla. Slowly
add flour to make a soft dough, kneading by hand. Make into a large
ball and refrigerate overnight. Take a small portion of dough (keep
the rest refrigerated) and roll out very thin on a powdered sugar
pastry cloth. (Do not use flour.) Cut into 2" squares. Put 1 teaspoon
of filling in center of square and pinch two opposite corners
together. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in 350 oven for 10 to
12 minutes. When cool, sprinkle with powdered sugar.
