Title: Breakfast Pizza
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Italian, Pizza
Yield: 6 servings
8 oz Mozzarella Cheese, grated
6    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Milk and/or cream
Salt and Pepper, to taste
1/4 md Onion, chopped
3/4 md Onion, from above, ringed
1 md Green pepper, ringed
1    Pizza crust
Prepare your favorite pizza crust and get ready to bake, as a regular
pizza.  Make sure that you have a fairly high ridge, as the there is
a lot of mixture, and it is fairly watery. Pugliese bread dough works
very well for a crust.

Beat eggs lightly.  Add cheese, onion and salt and pepper.  Mix
gently.

Lightly brush olive oil over the pizza base.  Pour mixture over the
crust. Place rings of green pepper over the top.  You can also
include onion rings, mushrooms, or other favorite Pizza toppings.
Color contrast helps here, as the mixture is rather plain looking.

Bake at 450 degrees for about 15-20 mins, or when crust is brown and
egg mixture is set.

I got the recipe from a TV show about how to make Pizzas, on PBS.
People that won't eat Pizza or Eggs with even go for this!
