Title: Self-Rising Flour-Substitution
Categories: Misc/food
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------SELF-RISING FLOUR--------------------------
1 c  A.P. flour
1 1/2 ts Leavining/baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
Self-rising flour may ONLY BE USED in place of all purpose flour
only if recipe you are making calls for salt and baking powder.  When
using self-rising flour in place of all purpose (A.P.) flour omit
salt and leavening as indicated in amounts shown above.

One problem with self-rising flour:  you can never be sure of the
efficacy of its built-in leavener (baking powder).  Long or improper
storage will weaken its leavening power and may affect the final
produce adversely.
