Title: Parmesan Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 50 servings
8 tb (1 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 c  (about 8 ounces) finely
Grated Parmesan cheese
1    Egg yolk
1/2 c  Water
"Parmesan Crackers are great with a cold beer or soda. Once you have
started eating them, it is nearly impossible to stop. 350~F. 15 to 20
minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, cut the butter into the
flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cheese and egg
yolk and mix well.

Add enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball. The texture will be somewhat crumbly, but the dough
will hold together when pressed.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll each into a rectangle about 1/4 inch
thick. Cut out individual crackers about 2 inches across with a
cookie cuttter or sharp knife and arrange them on an ungreased baking
sheet.

Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Bake for 10
minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake another 5 to 10 minutes, or
until medium brown.

Cool the crackers on a rack. Yield: 40-50.
