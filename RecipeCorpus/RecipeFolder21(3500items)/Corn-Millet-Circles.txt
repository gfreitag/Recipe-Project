Title: Corn-Millet Circles
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 50 servings
1 c  Corn flour
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Whole millet
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
1/2 c  Milk
"Corn flour provides an extra special sweetness for these crackers.
Millet gives them their incomparable texture. Corn-Millet Circles are
great with sharp Cheddar cheese or a rich pate. 325~F. 25 to 30
minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Mix the flours, millet, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl or
in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
resembles coarse meal. Slowly blend in enough of the milk to form a
dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8-inch thickness.

Using a 2-inch round cookie-cutter or the rim of a small glass, cut
out circular crackers. Place them on an ungreased baking sheet. Prick
each in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned, turning the
crackers over half-way through. Cool on a rack. Yield: 40-50.
