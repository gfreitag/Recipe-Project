Title: Snails with Frogs' Legs / Escargots Aux Grenouilles
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
48    Burgundy snails
Court bouillon
4    Shallots
Chives
3/4 c  White Macon wine
24    Frogs' legs
1/2 c  Milk
Flour
4 tb Butter
Salt and pepper
Chopped parsley, to garnish
[Looking at the ingredients, I figure that this'll feed 4 as a main
course or 8 as an appetizer.  -- mkm]

Preparation 1 1/2 hours.  Cooking 1 1/4 hours.

Cook the snails in advance in a court bouillon, then remove them from
their shells.  [There's a description of court bouillon in "Joy of
Cooking." Basically, a court bouillon is an aromatic liquid or stock,
sometimes containing wine, vinegar or lemon juice, used mainly for
cooking fish and shellfish, but also sometimes white offal (variety
meats) and some white meats.  -- mkm]  Chop them, together with the
peeled shallots and a small bunch of well-washed chives.  Place these
ingredients in a saucepan with the wine, cover and simmer for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, soak the frogs' legs in the milk for 1 hour.  Drain them,
then roll in flour and saute in the butter in a frying pan over a
brisk heat for 10 minutes.  Add the snails, together with their
cooking juices, and season with salt and pepper.  [Personally, I
prefer to mill the pepper at the dinner table.  The smell of the
freshly ground pepper would otherwise be lost.  -- mkm]  Turn up the
heat and cook for a further 5 minutes.

Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

White wines:  Macon-Clesse, -Lugny, -Vire or -Ige, Hermitage, Crepy.
