1/2 c  Cold water
1/4 c  Green Creme de Menthe
1/4 c  White Creme de Cocoa
1/2 c  Sugar, divided
1/8 ts Salt

Sugar crystals.
Sprinkle gelatin over water in a med. saucepan.  Add 1/4 c. of the
sugar, salt, and beaten egg yolks.  Stir until thoroughly blended.
Place over low heat and stir constantly until gelatin dissolves and
mixture thickens slightly, about 5 min.  Remove from the heat and
stir in liquers. Chill, stirring occasionally, until mixture mounds
slightly when dropped from a spoon.

Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Gradually add remaining
1/4 c. sugar and beat until very stiff.  Fold in gelatin mixture.

Beat the cream stiff and fold in the vanilla.  Fold into the
mixture and turn into a six cup mold.  Chill.  Unmold onto a green
plate and sprinkle with green sugar sprinkles.
