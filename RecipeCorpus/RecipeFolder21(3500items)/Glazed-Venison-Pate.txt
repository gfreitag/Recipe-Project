Title: Glazed Venison Pate
Categories: Meat, Game, British
Yield: 2 servings
1 lb Venison (trimmed weight)
1/2 lb Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)
1/2 lb Chicken livers
1 sm Orange
1    Lemon
2    Garlic cloves
1 1/2 ts Fresh thyme (more to taste)
Whole and ground bay leaves
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Olive oil
1/4 pt Red wine
1 ts Gelatine powder
A few kumquats to decorate
Mince all three meats fairly finely and put them into a bowl.  Add
the zest of the orange and lemon, the crushed garlic, the thyme,
olive oil, vinegar, a generous pinch of powdered bay and plenty of
black pepper.  Mix thoroughly and stir in the wine.  Cover and leave
to marinate overnight.

Season with salt - I find 1 teaspoon about right but fry a small
nugget of the mixture to check.  Turn the pate into a terrine of
about 2 1/4 pint capacity.  Pack the mixture well down into the
corners of the dish and use a spoon to hollow out slightly the centre
top.  Cover with greaseproof paper and foil, stand the dish in a
roasting pan containing enough hot water to come halfway up the sides
of the dish.  Bake at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for 2-1/4 to 2-1/2
hours.

Using a bulb baster, remove and reserve most of the juices that
surround the pate.  Replace the greaseproof paper and foil, press the
pate lightly with 1-1/2 to 2 lb weights and cool for 1-1/2 hours.
Then drain off any remaining juices that have not been re-absorbed by
the pate.  Mix all the venison juices that you have collected with
the juice of the orange and measure.  Add a splash of water if
necessary to make 1/2 pint in total. Dissolve the gelatine powder in
the mixture and use it to glaze the pate, adding a few bay leaves and
kumquats to decorate if liked.
