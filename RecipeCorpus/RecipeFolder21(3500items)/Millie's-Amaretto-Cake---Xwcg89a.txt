1/4 c  Amaretto liqueur

For the cake, in a large mixer bowl, mix together cake mix pudding
mix, eggs, water, extract, oil and amaretto on low speed. Beat on
high speed for 2 minutes. Generously grease the bottom and sides of a
bundt or tube pan and springle bottom with nuts. Pour in cake batter
and bake at 325F for 50-60 minutes or until a tester inserted in
center comes out clean.
For the glaze, in a saucepan, combine all ingredients and heat on
medium heat to melt butter and sugar. Stir frequently. Bring to a
boil and boil for 2-3 minutes.
Let baked bake cool in pan for 10 minutes on a rack. Remove from pan
and place on rack that has been placed over a deep dish. Gradually
spoon hot glaze over warm cake, a few tablespoons at a time, so cake
will absorb all of the glaze.
