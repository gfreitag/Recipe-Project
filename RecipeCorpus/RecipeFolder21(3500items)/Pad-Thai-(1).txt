Categories: Thai, Seafood, Poultry, Chicken
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 lb Thai flat rice noodles
- (bahn pho), OR rice sticks
Oil; for deep-frying
1/2 lb Fresh firm bean curd
- cut into tiny cubes
1/4 c  Peanut oil
1/2 tb Garlic, chopped
1/2 c  Chicken breast meat
-- (very thinly sliced)
1/4 lb Shrimp, peeled
- cut in half the long way
2    Eggs; beaten
1 tb Dried shrimp powder
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
3 tb Finely chopped peanuts
- (dry-roasted salted type)
2 tb Lime juice, freshly squeezed
1 tb Sugar
6 tb Thai fish sauce
1/4 c  Tamarind sauce
2 ts Red chili paste with garlic
2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
2    Limes; quartered
1/3 c  Fresh coriander leaves
3    Chopped scallions
4 tb Finely chopped peanuts

Soak the noodles in ample warm water until supple, about 15 minutes,
drain and set aside.  Place the noodles in boiling water and cook
just until the water returns to the boil.  Drain again.

Heat the oil for deep-frying to 375 degrees and deep-fry the cut bean
curd. Be sure the pat the bean curd dry on a paper towel first so
that it will not spatter fat on you.  Drain the bean curd and set
aside.

Heat a large wok and add the peanut oil, garlic, and chicken.  Chow
for a few minues and then add the shrimp, drained noodles, beaten
eggs, and deep-fried bean curd.  Toss well and chow for 3 to 4
minutes over medium-high heat.  Add the remaining ingredients, except
the garnishes, and chow or stir for a few more minutes until the
noodles are hot and tender.

Place on a serving platter with the garnishes, which are an integral
part of the dish.
