Title: Veal Piccata
Categories: Italian, Meat
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Boneless veal round,
(about 9-10 small pieces)
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
3 tb Flour
3/4 ts Dried oregano
3 tb Olive oil
2    Cloves garlic
1 lg Onion, chopped
1 1/2 c  Beef broth
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
8    Thin slices lemon
2 tb Capers
1/4 c  Finely minced fresh
Parsley
Rub the veal pieces with the salt, pepper, flour, and oregano. Heat
the oil over moderate-low heat in a 12-inch skillet. Add the garlic
and onion and saute for 3-5 minutes or until soft but not browned.
With a slotted spoon remove the onion and garlic and set aside. Raise
the heat to medium-high and brown the veal slices on both sides.
Return the onion and garlic to the pan and add the broth. Bring to a
boil, cover, then turn to simm for 10-15 minutes. Stir in the lemon
juice and coat the veal slices evenly with the juice. Arrange on a
heated serving platter and garnish with the lemon slices, capers, and
parsley. A nice accompaniment is Gnocchi a la Romaine.
