Categories: Cracker
Yield: 80 servings
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 tb Grated lemon zest
1/2 c  Sugar
8 tb (1 stick) butter or

"These delicate crackers never fail to attract a crowd. Fresh lemon
zest is the secret to their popularity. Perfect party fare or dessert
crackers, these treats are not too sweet, and they go well with a
fresh pot of tea in the afternoon. You will bake these crackers again
and again. 325~F. 12 to 15 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

To prepare the zest, lightly grate the outer peel of the lemon
against the fine grate of a cheese grater. Use only the colored part
of the rind; the underlying white portion is bitter. You should have
about 1/2 Tablespoon zest for this recipe. Squeeze the lemon for its
juice; you should have about 1-1/2 Tablespoons.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, cream the butter and sugar
together. Add the egg, the lemon juice, and the lemon zest. In another
bowl, combine the flour, coconut, baking powder, and salt.

Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and blend to form a dough
that will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2
portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll
thin, at most 1/8 inch. Cut out individual crackers about 2 inches
across with a cookie cutter, juice can, or knife and arrange on a
lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

Prick each cracker all the way through 2 or 3 times with the tines of
a fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake another
2 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness, or until just very
lightly browned. Cool the crackers on a rack. Yield: 75-80.

VARIATIONS: Try substituting orange zest and orange juice for the
lemon. If absolutely necessary, you can substitute dried ground lemon
peel. The result will not be as fresh and tasty, however.
