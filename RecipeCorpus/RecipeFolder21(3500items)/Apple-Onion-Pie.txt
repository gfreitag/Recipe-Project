Contributed to the echo by: Cheryl Johns Originally from "Sweet
Vidalia Onions - Blue Ribbon Recipes" Okay, folks, our favorite time
of year has come. The Vidalia onions have reached Virgina. I just
bought a 10 pound bag and a cookbook called Sweet Vidalia Onions -
Blue Ribbon Recipes. I'll post a few recipes tonight that I think
look interesting. Remember I just got the book tonight so I haven't
tried any of them. Peel, core and slice apples into 1/4 inch slices.
Peel and thinly slice onions. Layer the onion slices in a buttered 9
1/2 inch pyrex pie plate. Put a layer of apples on onion slices,
another layer of onions, ending with apples. Pour one cup of bouillon
over the layers, then sprinkle cracker crumbs on top. Drizzle melted
butter over the crumbs. Bake in oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or
until top has browned.
