Title: Salmon Pate
Categories: Appetizer, Fish
Yield: 16 servings
1 sl White bread
1 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Diced onion
1/2 c  Dry white wine
4    Eggs
3    Egg whites
1/2 lb Whitefish
2 1/4 lb Salmon
1 ts Salt
1 ts Ground white pepper
1 ts Ground coriander
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2 c  Whipping cream
PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Remove and discard the crust from the bread.
Tear the bread into pieces and set aside. Melt the butter in a
skillet over medium heat on the stove, add the onions and cook,
stirring for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the wine, bring to a
boil and cook 1 minute. Add the bread and cook, stirring 5 minutes.
Scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl. Roughly cut the whitefish and
salmon into 1-inch pieces and add to the bread in the mixing bowl.
Add the salt, pepper, coriander and nutmeg and mix. Place the mixture
in a food processor and process until smooth. Or, fit a meat grinder
with a medium die and grind the fish mixture twice. Transfer mixture
to a mixing bowl and place bowl over a pan of ice water. Add the eggs
and the whites and mix well. Slowly add the cream. Pack the mixture
into a 9-by-5-by-3-inch glass, ceramic or metal loaf pan. Tap the pan
on a counter to firmly pack. Cover tightly with a double layer of
aluminum foil. Place loaf pan in a larger pan and fill with boiling
water until it rises halfway to the top of the loaf pan. Place in the
oven for 1 hour. Remove pate from oven and its water bath. Place loaf
pan on a baking sheet. Cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate for at least 3
hours. To remove, run a knife around edges of the pate. Dip loaf pan
in hot water for a minute. Turn out onto a plate. Serve with toast or
crackers.
