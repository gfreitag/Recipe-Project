Allow 3/4. lb. per serving.  Baking a whole fish with the head on
helps to seal in juices at higher elevations.  Serve baked fish as
soon as it is taken from the oven so it will not become soggy.

Preheat oven to 375.  Use fish no smaller than 3 lbs.  Have pocket
made for stuffing.  Rub inside with salt and pepper.  Stuff
two-thirds full with Herb Stuffing for Fish (recipe follows).  Fasten
opening closed with skewers or picks.  Place fish on greased rack in
open roasting pan. Brush with melted  butter or margarine, sprinkle
with salt and seasoned pepper. Bake, basting with pan juices, until
fish is tender and flakes easily, about 12 - 20 minutes a pound for
fish over 5 pounds, and about 1 to 2 minutes per ounce for smaller
fish.  Serve baked with Bearnaise Sauce or Chablis Sauce (recipes
follow).

Herb Stuffing for Fish About 4 cups Combine all ingredients. Toss
with fork until well blended.  Put stuffing lightly into fish cavity
or wrap fish fillets around stuffing and secure with skewer or
toothpick.

Bearnaise Sauce About 3/4 cup In top of double boiler over boiling
water, melt butter with hot water. Stir in egg yolks. Beat with wire
wisk or rotary beater until frothy. Stir in vinegar, shallots or
onion, parsley, salt and paprika to taste.
Cook, stirring constantly, just until thickened and smooth, about 8
minutes. Remove double-boiler top from heat at once. Serve warm.

Sauce Chablis In small heavy saucepan, combine Chablis wine, lemon
juice, bay leaf, salt and peppercorns. Cook 5 minutes over low heat,
stirring to blend. Strain sauce, adding enough water to make 1 cup.
In separate saucepan, melt butter; stir in flour.   Add strained
liquids. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened.
Beat a little hot sauce into beaten egg yolks, then add yolk mixture
to saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring vigorously, just until
thickened - one minute or so. Serve hot. The High Altitude Cookbook,
