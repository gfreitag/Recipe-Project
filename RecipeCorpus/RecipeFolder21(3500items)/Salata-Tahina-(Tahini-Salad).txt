Title: Salata Tahina (Tahini Salad)
Categories: Misc/food, Salsa/sauce, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
2    Garlic cloves
Salt
3/4 c  Tahini
1 tb White vinegar
1    Lemon; juiced
1/2 c  -Water
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
Crush garlic cloves with 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Place tahini in mixing bowl and beat well.  This preliminary beating
reduces the strong flavour of the tahini.

Beat in garlic and vinegar.  Gradually add lemon juice alternately
with water.  To make a cream salad of good consistency add enough
lemon juice to make the tahini very thick before adding water.  This
way you have more scope in adjusting the flavour and consistency of
the sauce.

Add salt to taste, and more lemon juice if a sharper sauce is
required. Blend in cumin and parsley and chill until required.  Serve
as a mazza or as directed in recipes.

Makes about 1 3/4 cups
