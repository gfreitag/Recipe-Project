Title: Eggplant Stuffing
Categories: Greek, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
3 md Eggplants (1 lb ea.)
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  Chopped scallions
-=OR=- Shallots
1    Garlic clove; sliced (opt.)
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Chopped fresh fennel or dill
1/2 ts Allspice; more if necessary
1/4 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Tomato paste; MIXED WITH:
1/2 c  Water
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise.  With a small knife, cut away
the eggplant flesh from the skin without breaking the skin (if
planning to stuff the shells, leave 1/4-inch of the flesh with the
skin as a firm base) and set the shells aside.  Dice the eggplant
flesh and push through the medium blade of a meat grinder as quickly
as possible to avoid discoloration.  (Or the eggplant may be pureed
in a blender or food processor.)

Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the scallions and garlic.  Add
the parsley, fennel, allspice, wine, and the diluted tomato paste.
Stir in the eggplant pulp, season with salt and pepper, and simmer
for 20 minutes. Taste to adjust seasonings.  Add the bread crumbs to
absorb excess liquid.

Stuff the eggplant shells, if desired, and place in an oiled baking
dish. Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 35 minutes.  Serve warm - or
particularly good - cold.
