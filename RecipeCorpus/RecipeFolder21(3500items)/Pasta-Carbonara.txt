Title: Pasta Carbonara
Categories: Italian
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Thick-sliced bacon, diced
2 tb Salt
1 lb Linguini
3    Eggs
1/3 c  Chopped Italian parsley
Grated Parmesan cheese
Fresh ground pepper to taste
1.  Saute the bacon in a small skillet until crisp. Remove with a
slotted spoon and drain well on a paper towel.

2.  Boil the water and cook linguini until firm and tender.

3.  Meanwhile, beat the eggs thoroughly in a large bowl suitable for
serving. Have the cooked bacon and the chopped parsley ready at hand.

4.  When the pasta is done, drain it immediately in a colander, and
pour into the bowl of eggs and immediately begin tossing it. As the
strands of pasta become coated with the beaten eggs, their heat will
cook the eggs.

5.  Sprinkle the bacon and parsley on, and serve immediately. This is
great with lots of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground
black pepper.
