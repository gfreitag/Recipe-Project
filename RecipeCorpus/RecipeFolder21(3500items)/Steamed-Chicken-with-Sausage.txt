Categories: Poultry, Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
1    Roasting chicken, 4 - 4.5 lb
- cut up
4    Chinese pork sausages
- thinly sliced diagonally
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 tb Light soy sauce
2 tb Chinese rice wine
-or dry sherry
1 tb Sesame oil
1 ts Sugar
1 pn Salt
ARRANGE THE BACK PIECES on a heat-proof plate. Surround them with the
rest of the chicken pieces. Between the pieces, insert thin slices of
pork sausage. Put the breast meat on the bottom, so that it is
surrounded by the longer-cooking dark meat. Put some water in the
bottom of the wok. Use enough that it won't boil away, but not so
much that it touches the plate. The food must be suspended at least 1
inch above the water level. Cover the wok tightly so that the steam
is captured under the lid and can circulate freely around the food.
Keep a kettle of water on hand to replenish the steaming liquid in
the wok if the level gets too low. Be careful not to pour the water
onto the food.

Makes 4 to 6 Servings
