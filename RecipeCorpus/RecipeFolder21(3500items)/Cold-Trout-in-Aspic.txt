Title: Cold Trout in Aspic
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 servings
6    Trout
Salted Water
4 c  Quick fish aspic
Green onion stems and
Hard-cooked egg whites
(sliced thin) for decorating
Cook the trout in simmering salted water for 4 to 6 minutes, or
until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.  Place on a
wire rack. Make two diagonal incisions on one side of the fish a few
inches apaprt. Pry under the skin and peel it off, leaving the head
and tail intact. Chill the fish.
Spoon chilled but still-liquid aspic over fish.
Make a flower design on the skinned portion of fish as follows:  Use
trimmed green parts of onions as stems.  Cut the egg white slices
with a paring knife to simulate flower petals.  Dip the decorations
with still- liquid aspic and arrange on the fish. Chill.
Cover with layers of aspic as desired, chilling after each layer is
applied.  To serve, garnish the fish platter with chopped aspic and
serve with mayonnaise.
