newspaper Randy Farkas Jerked Chicken Mix seasonings and soy sauce
and rub over the chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate overnight to
marinate. The next day, bake marinated chicken in 350F oven for 1-1/2
hours. Meanwhile, make the sauce by blending all ingredients in
blender or food processor until smooth. When chicken has cooked for
1-1/2 hours, remove from the oven and dip each piece in blended sauce
mixture. Return chicken to oven and bake an additional 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, boil remaining sauce for 15 to 20 minutes, or until
thickened. Serve hot sauce with the chicken.

Serves 4.
