2/3 c  Potato flour
2 tb Dried chives, OR

"A healthful and appealing alternative to potato chips for kids and
adults alike. We add chopped chives for a classic baked potato flavor
combination, but various herbs would complement the strong potato
flavor of this cracker. 350~F. 15 to 30 minutes Prehat the oven to
350~F.

In the food processor or a large bowl, combine the flours, chives,
salt, and pepper. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Slowly blend in the water to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out into a thin rectangle 1/16 to 1/8
inch thick. Sprinkle lightly and evenly with a little salt and
paprika, if desired, and roll over the dough lightly with the rolling
pin.

With a sharp kife or a cookie cutter, cut into 2-inch squares or other
shapes. Transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each
cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Some crackers will
brown more quickly than others, so keep a careful watch during the
last five minutes of baking. Remove to a rack to cool. Yield: 65-70.

VARIATIONS: For the ultimate baked potato cracker, substitute sour
cream for the water and crumble crisp bacon into the flour. Increase
or decreas the amount of pepper to taste.
