Title: Scandinavian Hardtack
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Rye flour
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat or all-purpose
Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1/4 c  Oil
1 c  Plain yogurt
"The yogurt lends an initial tartness, but the aftertaste is mellow
and full of rye flavor. This simple cracker is good with peach jam.
300~F. 30 to 35 minutes Preheat oven to 300~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flours, salt,
and sugar.

Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the
yogurt and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
ball. The dough should be quite stiff. Divide into 4 equal portions
for rolling.

On a floured surface, roll these out, one at a time, into large
circles. Roll as thin as possible, about 1/16 inch, so that each is
approximately 12 inches in diameter. Prick all over with a fork,
making certain to push all the way through the dough.

Place on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Turn the
circles over and continue baking for another 15 to 20 minutes, or
until crisp and completely dried throughout. Watch carefully and
remove the hardtack the moment it starts to brown. Browning adversely
affects the flavor of these crackers. Cool on a rack.

VARIATION: All rye flour can be used instead of the wheat-rye
combination.
