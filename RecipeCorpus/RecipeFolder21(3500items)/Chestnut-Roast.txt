Dried breadcrumbs
Melt the butter (or substitute) and saute the onion and celery over
moderate heat for 10 minutes until soft but not brown.  Transfer to a
large bowl.  Drain the chestnuts and add to the bowl.  Mix these
ingredients together well.

Mash the chestnuts, onion and celery, then mix into the bowl the
chopped parsley, lemon juice and garlic.

The mixture should be soft but firm enough to form into a roll, so
add a few whole-wheat breadcrumbs, if necessary, especially if you're
using canned chestnuts.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper to
taste.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Pour a little of the oil into a roasting
pan and put into the oven to heat.

Form the chestnut mixture into a roll about 8 inches long, pressing it
together carefully, then coat it well with the dried breadcrumbs.
Put the chestnut roll into the roasting pan and carefully turn it so
that it is coated with hot oil.

Bake for 45 minutes, until it is crisp on the outside, spooning a
little more of the oil over the roll from time to time during the
cooking.  Serve the Chestnut Roast cut into slices.
