Title: Stuffed Prawns
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 2 servings
8    Giant prawns
1 tb Olive oil
2 tb Minced onions
1 tb Minced garlic
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1 tb Chopped parsley
1/4 lb Smoked salmon
2    Egg whites
1/3 c  Dry white wine
3 tb Unsalted butter
PEEL THE PRAWNS. Using a small knife, make a deep slit down the back.
Remove and discard the vein and set 6 prawns aside in the
refrigerator. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat,
add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Remove from
heat and scrape into a food processor. Add the bread crumbs, parsley,
smoked salmon, 2 leftover prawns and egg white to the blender and
blend until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl. Remove the
prawns from the refrigerator and lay them flat on a work surface.
Spoon some stuffing into each prawn and lightly press the sides
together around the stuffing. Preheat a broiler. Arrange stuffed
prawns in a small ovenproof dish, pour in the wine and place under
the broiler for about 4 minutes or until prawns and stuffing are
completely opaque in color. Remove from the broiler and transfer the
prawns to a serving plate. Stir the butter into remaining liquid in
the broiling pan and pour over the prawns. Serve immediately.
