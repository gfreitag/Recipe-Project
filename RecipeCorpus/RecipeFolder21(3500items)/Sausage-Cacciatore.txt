Title: Sausage Cacciatore
Categories: Italian, Pork
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Italian Sausage
(hot/sweet/both)
1 lb Green bell peppers
3/4 lb Spanish onions
3 cl Garlic
1/2 lb Canned mushrooms
3 c  Italian tomatoe sauce
Fry sausage until 3/4 cooked ( about 15min ). Remove. Cut and core
peppers and slice into strips. Peel and slice onions into strips. Fry
pepper strips in sausage grease add oil if not enough grease. Fry
about 5 min and onions and continue frying chop garlic and add
mushrooms and fry about 5 mins. Add sausage and sauce and simmer on
low until meat is hot about 10 min. I usually serve this as a "hot"
dish in a hot and cold buffet. It can serve as a main dish with a
side of pasta or rice. Also makes a great hot sandwich on Italian
bread.or great pocket sandwich on syrian (pita) bread. It also makes
great table art when you drop it on a white tablecloth (smile). Its a
very versitle dish can substitute with any kind of meat.Enjoy!
