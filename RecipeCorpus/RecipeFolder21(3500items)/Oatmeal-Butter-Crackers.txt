Title: Oatmeal Butter Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 60 servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats (oatmeal)
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
6 tb (3/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, melted and
Cooled
1/2 c  Milk
Preheat the oven to 325~ F. "Crunchy and nutty, these crackers make a
nutritious snack. Put your feet up after a hard day's work and enjoy
a few with a glass of fresh lemonade.

20 to 25 minutes
325~ F

Stir together the flour, oats, salt, and sugar in a large bowl or in
the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Blend in enough of the milk to form a dough that will
hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divid the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll as thin as possible, to about 1/16 inch
thick. Using a spatula, rolling pin, or your hands, transfer the
rolled dough gently onto a large baking sheet.

With a sharp knife, score the dough into 2-inch squares without
cutting all the way throug the dough. Prick each square 2 or 3 times
with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, turning over after 15 minutes, until
crisp. Cool on a rack. Break into individual crackers when cool.
Yield: 50-60.
