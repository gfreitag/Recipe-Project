This came from my friend's Pennsylvania cookbook. I tried it once and
hope to try it again. It's different from anything I've had before.

Cook 4 large potatoes. Mash and add 1/4 lb. white American cheese.
Cook 1/2 box lasagna noodles and drain. Grease an oblong pan with
butter. Add a little milk to prevent sticking. Fry 2 large onions in
butter. Layer noodles and potatoes. Top with onions. Bake at 350
degrees for 35 minutes.
