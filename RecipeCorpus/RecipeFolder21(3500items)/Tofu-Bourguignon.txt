Title: Tofu Bourguignon
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Firm tofu
- cut into 1 in. squares
1 1/2 c  Dry red wine
1/4 c  Tamari
4    Garlic cloves; pressed
-Water as needed
2 tb Olive oil
2 c  Sliced onions
4 c  Sliced mushrooms
4    Bay leaves
1 ts Thyme
1 ts Tarragon
4 tb Whole wheat pastry flour
Place the pieces of tofu in a large, shallow dish.  Mix together the
wine, tamari, and garlic.  Pour the mixture over the tofu, add water
as need to cover it, and let it marinate for at least one hour.  If
the tofu is going to marinate for more than an hour, place in the
refrigerator.

Place the marinated tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet, reserving the
marinade.  Bake at 375oF for 35-45 minutes or until crispy and brown.
Turn the tofu over once during the baking so that it browns on both
sides.

While the tofu bakes, heat the oil in a large pan and slowly saute the
onions.  When the onions are almost tender, add the mushrooms and the
herbs.  Saute for a few minutes more.  Add the flour and mix well.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in a little of the marinade.
Continue stirring until a paste is formed.  Return the pan to the
heat and slowly add the remaining marinade, stirring constantly.  Add
the baked tofu and simmer until thickened.

Serve over pasta, rice or millet.
