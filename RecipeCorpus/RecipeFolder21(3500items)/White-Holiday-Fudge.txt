Butter a 9 x 13-inch baking pan; set aside. In a heavy 4-quart
saucepan, combine cream, corn syrup, butter and sugar. Place over
medium heat and stir occasionally with a wooden spoon until mixture
comes to a boil. If sugar crystals are present, wash down sides of
the pan with a wet pastry brush. Clip on candy thermometer. Cook to
238 F (115 C) or soft- ball stage. Remove from heat and let stand
undisturbed until the thermometer reads 200 F (95 C). Remove
thermometer. With a wooden spoon, beat mixture until it thickens and
lightens in color. Stir in vanilla, nuts and fruits and mix well.
Turn into prepared pan, pressing mixture into corners. Refrigerate 24
hours. Cut into 1-inch squares and serve or dip into tempered
chocolate if desired. Shared by ELLIE COLLIN (CMKD93F).
