Title: Steaks with Crushed Peppercorns
Categories: Beef, Salsa/sauce, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
4 ea Shell steaks 10 oz each
Salt
1 tb Peppercorns, black
3 tb Corn oil
5 ts Butter
2 tb Shallots, chopped fine
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1. Sprinkle the steaks with salt. 2. Using a mallet or the bottom of a
saucepan, crush the peppercorns but not to finely. Sprinkle the
steaks with equal amounts of pepper on both sides. Press down with
the hands to help the peppercorns adhere to the meat. 3. Heat the oil
in a heavy skillet. When it is hot and almost smoking, add the
steaks. Cook about 3 min., then turn the steaks over. Cook on the
other side about 2 min., or longer, depending on how you like your
steaks done. Remove the steaks to a warm platter and keep hot. 4.
Pour the fat from the skillet. Add 2 tsp of butter to the skillet and
when melted, add the shallots. Cook, stirring, until translucent. Add
the wine and cook, stirring, until the wine is almost reduced. Stir
in the cream and cook over high heat about 1 min. 5. Swril in the
remaining butter. Pour the sauce over the steaks.
