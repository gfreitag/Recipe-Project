Title: Barley Chips
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 55 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Barley flour
1/2 c  Rolled barley (barley
Flakes)
2 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
8 tb (1 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/2 c  Milk
"Very few people really know the taste of barley. Rolled barley looks
like oatmeal, but has a slightly sharper taste and less nutty flavor.
These sweet barley crackers have a tender texture. Try them with just
a cold glass of milk. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
325~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, stir together the flours,
barley, sugar, and salt.

Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add enough
of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut into 2-inch
circles or squares and place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined
baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a
fork.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until medium brown. Cool on a wire rack.
Yield: 45-55.

VARIATIONS: For a richer cracker, substitute 2 Tablespoons barley malt
syrup for the sugar and reduce the amount of milk slightly.

This recipe can be made with oatmeal (rolled oats) and oat flour for a
distinctive oat flavor.
