Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman Lentil Loaf Oil for loaf pan

Saute onion and tomato in oil until onion is golden and tomato is
soft. In a bowl mash up the cooked lentils a little. Add onion &
tomato; mix in garlic powder, salt, milk, cheese, and 1 cup of the
bread crumbs. Preheat oven to 350. Glop mixture into oiled loaf pan,
sprinkle remaining crumbs on top and bake for 1/2 hour or until done.
You could add a Tbs. of ketchup...you could put just about anything
in there (celery, bell pepper...) Tonight I'm going to beat one egg
and mix it in to make the loaf stick together better. And maybe add a
touch of ketchup or BBQ sauce or something. You can serve with any
sauce or gravy or anything.
