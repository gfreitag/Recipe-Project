Title: Saltimbocca Alla Genovese (From Liguria Area)
Categories: Italian
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Veal scallops, sliced 1/4"
Thick, pounded thin
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Fresh sage, dried sage or
Ground sage
1/2 lb Thin slices of prosciutto
Flour
4 tb Butter
1 c  Marsala or dry white wine
1/2 c  Hot beef bouillon
Trim the veal scallops so that they are approximately all the same
size. (Save trimmings for sauces.)  Sprinkle a little salt and pepper
on each slice of meat.  Place 2 or more leaves of fresh or dried sage
on each veal slice, or sprinkle about a scant 1/4 teaspoon ground
sage on each. Cut prosciutto to the same size as veal slices.  Top
each veal slice with a prosciutto slice.  Roll up and secure with
toothpicks or tie with kitchen thread.  Coat each veal roll lightly
with flour, shaking off excess flour. Divide butter between 2 large
frying pans; heat it  without browning. Over medium heat, cook veal
rolls about 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides.  Reduce
heat and add 1/2 cup marsala  and 1/4 cup beef bouillon to each
frying pan.  Cover frying pans and  cook for 5 to 10 minutes longer;
cooking time depends on the size and  thickness of the rolls. Shake
the pans frequently to prevent sticking.  If necessary, add a little
more beef bouillon; there should be 1 to 2 tablespoons sauce for each
veal bird. Transfer the cooked veal birds  to a heated serving dish
and spoon the sauce over them.  Serve  immediately and very hot with
a tossed green salad.  6 servings.
