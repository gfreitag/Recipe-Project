8 lasagne noodles (San Giorgio if possible or an imported) *Cook
noodles until easy to work with but very al dente. Drain on flat
cloth to get rid of exess moisture.
Filling: 1 lb ricotta 4 oz grated mozzarella 1/2 cup grated Ital.
cheese 1/2 pk frozen chopped spinach, cooked and drained well 1 egg
salt and pepper to taste Sauce: Any meat, marinara or jarred sauce if
you prefer. I prefer homemade. There is a marinara sauce posted that
is easy and good. I will post a meat sauce befor the end of the day.
Assembly: Mix filling ingredients together well. On each wide noodle
place filling along entire strip leaving 1" at each end. Gently roll
each noodle carefully keeping the filling inside. In a rectangular
dish, cover bottom with sauce. Place roll-ups side by side. Pour
enough sauce over top to partially cover. Seal with foil. Bake at 375
for 45 min. For a special topping use a white sauce or what is called
"bachemal".
