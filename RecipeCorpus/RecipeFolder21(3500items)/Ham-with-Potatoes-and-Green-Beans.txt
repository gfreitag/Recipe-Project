Title: Ham with Potatoes and Green Beans
Categories: Meat
Yield: 4 servings
1    HAM (w/ bone) 3-5 lbs.
A buncha potatoes
A couple a handfuls of
Cut green beans (canned is
OK in a pinch)
Get a big pot o' water (enough to sink the ham), slow boil the ham
'til it starts falling off the bone, quarter the spuds, and when
they're about done, drop in the beans. Season to taste.  That's the
extent of my cooking prowess, try it, it's cheap, and it's easy, and
it tastes pretty good (to my palate, anyway).
