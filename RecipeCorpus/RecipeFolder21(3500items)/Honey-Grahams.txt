Title: Honey Grahams
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 40 servings
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Turbinado sugar (regular
Sugar can be substituted)
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Cinnamon
8 tb (1 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/4 c  Honey
1/2 c  Warm water
"These are slightly sweet crackers with a wonderful wheaty flavor. The
crystalline turbinado sugar gives them a unique crunchiness. Perfect
in a lunch bag or as an after-school snack, they are best next to a
tall glass of cold milk. 375~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
375~F.

Mix together the flours, sugar, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon in a
large bowl or in the food processor. Cut the butter into these dry
ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Dissolve the
honey in the warm water. Add this honey-water mixture to the flour
mixture and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll the dough out to about 3/16 inch thick.
With a sharp knife, cut into 2- by 3-inch rectangles. Prick each one
all the way though in 3 or 4 places with the tines of a fork.

Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Turn and bake an additional 10 to 15
minutes, or until light brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 35-40.

VARIATIONS: Put thin slices of banana or other fruit on top of some
of the rectangles or dough pieces left over from cutting. They may
take an extra 4 to 5 minutes to bake. These afterthoughts have a
tendency to disappear first.
