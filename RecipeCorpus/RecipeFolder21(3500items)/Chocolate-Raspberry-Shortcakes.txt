From Gourmet/May 1991 For the shortcakes
Make the shortcakes:  In a bowl sift together the cocoa powder,
the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt, add
butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the
cream and stir the mixture with a fork until it forms a dough.
Divide the dough in half, arrange each half in a mound on a lightly
greased baking sheet, and bake the shortcakes in the middle of a 425
oven for 12 min., or until a tester inserted in the centers come out
with crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a rack to cool.

In a bowl mash 3/4 cup of the raspberries with a fork, stir in 1
tbsp. of the granulated sugar and the framboise, stirring until the
sugar is dissolved, and stir in the remaining 3/4 cup raspberries.
In a small bowl with an electric mixer beat the cream until it holds
soft peaks, add the remaining 1 tbsp. granulated sugar, and beat the
cream until it holds stiff peaks.  Cut the shortcakes in half.(The
shortcakes are delicate and crumble easily.)  Top each bottom half
with half the raspberry mixture, divide the whipped cream between the
2 shortcakes. With a spatula carefully top each serving with the top
half of a shortcake. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and garnish
with mint. Serves: 2 Shared By: Pat Stockett
