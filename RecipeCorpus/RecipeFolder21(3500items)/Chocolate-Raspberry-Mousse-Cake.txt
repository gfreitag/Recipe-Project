CHOCOLATE CAKE:   In large bowl, beat egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the
sugar until very pale.  In separate bowl, beat egg whites until soft
peaks form; gradually beat in remaining sugar until stiff peaks form.
Fold egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture. Sift flour and cocoa
over egg mixture; gently fold in.  Pour into buttered 8 inch
springform pan;bake in 350F oven for 30-35 minutes or until top
springs back when lightly touched. Run knife around edge of cake to
loosen.  Let cool on wire rack.

RASPBERRY SYRUP:  In small saucepan, combine sugar and water; cook
over medium heat until sugar has dissolved, about 1 minutes.
Stir in liqueur.  Let cool.

RASPBERRY MOUSSE:  In small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water; let
stand for 5 minutes to soften.  Pass berries through food mill to
puree and remove seeds to make aobut 2 cups. Transfer puree to
separate saucepan. Add sugar and lemon juice; cook over medium heat,
stirring occasionally, until sugar hs dissolved, about 5 minutes.
Stir in liqueur; transfer to large bowl.  Over low heat, heat gelatin
until dissolved; stir into raspberry mixture.  Chill, stirring
occasionally,over larger bowl of ice and water for about 20 minutes
or until consistency of raw egg whites. Whip cream; fold into cooled
raspberry mixture. Reserve 1/2 cup for garnish.

TO ASSEMBLE: Cut cake into 3 or 4 thin layers; reserve 2 layers and
freeze remaining layers for another use.  Sprinkle 1 cut side of each
of the 2 layers with raspberry syrup.  Place 1 layer, syrup side up,
in 9 inch springorm pan; pour in half of the raspberry mousse. Top
with second cake layer;pour in enough of the remaining mousse to come
almost to top of pan. Smooth surface.  Refrigerate until firm, 1-2
hours.

CHOCOLATE GLAZE: In top of double boiler over hot, not boiling,
water, melt chocolate with crea, stirring until smooth.  Let cool to
room temperature yet still spreadable; pour over mousse and spread
evenly. Spoon remaining mouse into pastry bag fitted with small plain
tip; pipe three concentric circles over top of cake.  Pull toothpick
through circles to form spiderweb design.  Refrigerate until chilled.
