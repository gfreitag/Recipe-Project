1/3 c  Loosely packed brown sugar
1 tb Toasted caraway seeds,

A knife
1 1/2 tb Powdered, unsweetened cocoa
5 tb Plus 1 teaspoon (1/3 cup)

1 tb Toasted whole caraway seeds

"The cocoa gives a dark color and rich flavor to these unique rye
crisps. They go well with soups. Try them slightly warmed with cold
12 to 18 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
Vichyssoise. 350~F.

In the food processor or a large bowl, mix the flours, cornmeal, salt,
baking soda, brown sugar, ground caraway seeds, and cocoa. Cut in the
butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Add the whole caraway seeds and mix to distribute them evenly
throughout the dough. Blend in the molasses and enough of the water
to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or wax paper and chill for at least 1/2
hour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife,
cut into 1-1/2 by 2-1/2-inch rectangles. Place them on a lightly
greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Brush the
tops with the egg white mixture. Bake for 12 to 18 minutes. The edges
should be slightly browned, and the center surfaces should be firm
and resist pressure when touched with your finger.

Cool on a rack. Yield: 35-40.

VARIATION: Substitute anise seeds for the caraway seeds.
