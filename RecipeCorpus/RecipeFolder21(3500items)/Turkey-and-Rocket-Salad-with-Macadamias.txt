Title: Turkey and Rocket Salad with Macadamias
Categories: Salad
Yield: 4 servings
1    Bunch of rocket, discarding
The coarse stem ends
1 sm Soft lettuce
250 g  Macadamia nuts
2 cl Garlic, chopped
Salt & pepper to taste
100 ml Macadamia oil
50 ml White wine vinegar
1 lb Turkey, sliced
Chives
Turkey meat, which tends to be dry, benefits particularly from
this macadamia dressing, but any roast poultry meat you have left
over can be used instead. Another soft lettuce can stand in for the
rocket (arugula) if you simply can't obtain the latter, but it won't
provide the delicate, savoury flavour. Macadamia oil can now be
obtained in some supermarkets.
Arrange the leaves on four plates.

Heat 250 g macadamia nuts in an ungreased container in the oven
until they smell appetizing, then set half aside and tip the other
half into the bowl of a food processor. Add: 2 garlic cloves, roughly
chopped. With salt and pepper process to a paste.
With the food processor.running, slowly add 100 ml macadamia oil,
then 50 ml white wine vinegar.

Slice or shred enough turkey for four people and gently loss it
in the macadamia salad.

Arrange the dressed turkey on the prepared plates, drizzle
left-over dressing over the salad leaves, Sprinkle with reserved
macadamia nuts, roughly chopped, and finely chopped chives. Serve.

A few extra chillies would give this salad a lot more punch.
