Title: Celery Seed Circles
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 50 servings
3 c  All-purpose flour
2 1/2 ts Celery seeds
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
3 tb Vegetable shortening
About 2/3 cup water

"Celery seeds are not the seeds of the celery you eat as a vegetable.
Rather, they are the tangy fruit of a plant related to the parsley
family. Try them with a cold glass of fruit juice mixed with club
soda. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

Stir together the flour, celery seeds, salt, and pepper in a large
bowl or in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the
mixture is the consistency of coarse meal. Add enough of the water to
form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch thick maximum. Cut the
dough into 2-inch circles with a cookie cutter. Arrange them on
ungreased baking sheets.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.
Yield: 40-50.

VARIATION: Caraway seeds can be substituted for celery seeds. Grind
the caraway seeds in a food mill before using. The caraway version of
these crackers is delicious with cream cheese.
