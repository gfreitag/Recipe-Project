Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM-------------------ALYCE MANTIA - KRBS41A------------------------
8 lg Navel oranges
5    Basil sprigs
1/2 c  Basil leaves; packed
2    Egg yolks
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Dry white wine
Using a vegetable peeler, remove a strip of zest from one of the
oranges and chop enough to measure 1/4 tsp. Using a knife, peel skin
and pith from oranges and cut in between the membranes to remove the
sections. Using hands, lightly crush the basil sprigs and toss in a
large bowl with the orange sections.  Cover and chill 2-6 hours.
Mince the 1/2 cup basil. In a medium bowl combine the egg yolks,
sugar, wine and reserved orange zest. Place over a saucepan of
simmering water and whisk until the zabaglione is frothy, thick, and
doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced basil.  Drain
the orange sections and remove basil sprigs. Divide among 3 dessert
dishes and spoon a heaping tablespoon of zabaglione over each one.
