Title: Great Guacamole
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
1    Avocado
12 ts Spike or parsley
Pinch Mexican seasoning
1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Dried oregano
Cut avocado in half, remove seed, and scoop out pulp, reserving seed.
In small bowl, mash with fork, mixing in seasonings. Whip with fork
until creamy. If you are not going to serve guacamole immediately,
return seed to bowl to prevent discoloration, cover tightly, and
refrigerate until ready to use. Serve as dip for natural corn chips,
celery stalks, or other raw vegetables.
