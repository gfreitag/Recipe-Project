Title: Garlic Roaster

1    Homemade garlic roaster
Making roasted garlic is simple and easy, even without one of
those "in" garlic roasters!

Peel slightly, and cut the whole head of garlic in half
horizontally. Put both halves cut side up in a baking dish.  Add
about 1/4 c. chicken stock, if you're so inclined.  Drizzle both
halves with olive oil, and sprinkle with rosemary, if you like.
Cover with foil.

Bake at 350 F. for 45 min., or until garlic is soft.  Use a knife
or spoon to dig out the now-soft cloves of garlic, and smear on
toasted French rounds.
