Categories: Snack, Appetizer, Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
6 md Potatoes
3 tb Yellow split peas
Salt
2 tb Oil
5 ea Fenugreek seeds
2 tb Chopped onions
3 tb Parsley
1 ea Fresh hot green chili
Two hours before using, boil the potatoes in their jackets.  While
they are boiling, boil split peas in 3 cups water with a sprinkling
of salt for 15 minutes.  Remove from heat & drain very well, ensuring
that you get rid of all the excess water. Set aside in a covered bowl.

In a skillet, add the oil & heat over a medium flame until it is very
hot. Add the fenugreek.  When they change colour, add onions & fry
for 2 minutes, till the onion starts to brown.  Add parsley, green
chili & stir another 2 minutes.  Next, put in the split peas, a
little more salt if desired & cook, stirring for 5 minutes or until
you are sure that all the water has evaporated.  The mixture should
become one lump.  Cover & set aside.

Peel & mash the potatoes with a fork or hand masher, do not use an
electric beater otherwise your patties wil lnot hold together when
cooked. A few lumps will remain, but get it as smooth as you can.
Add somec salt & mix thoroughly.

Divide the potatoes into 12 balls & do the same with the split pea
mixture. Flatten each potato ball in you hand, put one portion of the
split pea mixture in the centre.  Roll up into a ball again & flatten
once more into a patty.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

To cook the patties, you need very little oil & some patience so as
not to lose the crust to the skillet when you turn them over.  Coat
the bottom of the skillet with a small amount of oil.  Cook no more
than two patties at any one time in each skillet.  Cook for 7
minutes, gently turn over & cook for another 7 to 8 minutes.  The
patties should be reddish brown on each side.  Keep the heat fairly
low otherwise they will burn.

Serve with chutney.
