flavoured with whole spices. the recipe was given to me by my
sister-in-law Rachna, who entices her family to eat carrots this way."

Slice the onion into thin half rounds. In a large, heavy bottom
saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the bay leaf. cumin,
cloves, cardamom pod, cinnamon and peppercorns. cook until the spices
puff up and darken ( 1 to 2 seconds), then add the sliced onion and
