Title: Millet Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 85 servings
1/4 c  Whole millet
1/2 c  Millet flour
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
5/8 c  (1/2 cup plus 2 Tb) milk
1 tb Honey
"Millet is an excellent grain which is too often overlooked. It adds
both texture and a sweet flavor. These simple crackers are splendid
with a fresh fruit salad. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
350~F.

Stir together the millet, flours, and salt in a large bowl or in the
food processor. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Warm the milk in a small saucepan. Dissolve the honey in
the warm milk. Add this sweetened milk to the flour mixture and blend
to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If
necessary, add a little more milk.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, maximum 1/8 inch. With a sharp
knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares and place them on a lightly
greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3
times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 10 minutes. Turn over and continue baking another 10 to 15
minutes, or until medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 75-85.
