Contributed to the echo by: Blanche Nonken Originally from: The
Krishna Echo I make a lentil soup called mung dahl which is very nice
accompaniment for grains, like rice with peas, or chapattis which are
unleavened wheat-flour 'tortillas' made from very finely ground wheat
flour called atta or durham flour. Put in large saucepan, cook high
till foam rises, skim foam off.

Put tomato into boiling soup for couple mins until skin breaks, take
it out and under cold water, skin tomato and navel, cut into small
cubes. Put back into soup, then: Add to soup then add: turmeric and
salt

Now, in a small frying pan, put 2 T of ghee or oil (ghee preferred)
and put in 1/2 t red chillis (more or less to taste) after oil is
heating up, don't burn, then put in 1-1/2 t. cumin seeds, let brown,
don't burn, and add, 3/4 t. mustard seeds and pop 'em all. This
mixture is called 'chaunce' and add that to the boiling soup very
carefully. The chaunce should explode with a 'chunnnnggg' and a
strong aroma fill the immediate cooking area (hehe). If you start to
cough a bit, you're doing just fine. Let cook until beans are no
longer recognizable, or have dissolved, about 1/2 hr to 40 mins all
together from flame on to end of cooking time. Serve very hot.
Sprinkle generously with the leaves only of corriander (cilantro).
Worth the time.
