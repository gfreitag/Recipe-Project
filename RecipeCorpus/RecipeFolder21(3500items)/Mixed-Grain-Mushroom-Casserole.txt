Title: Mixed Grain Mushroom Casserole
Categories: Side dish, Main dish, Casserole
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Wild rice
1/2 c  Pearl barley
1/2 c  Brown rice
1/4 c  Oil
1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
4    Garlic cloves; chopped
4 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
-OR- Oil
1/2 lb Mushrooms; thickly sliced
3 1/2 c  Broth
1 ts Crushed dried thyme
1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
Salt & pepper; to taste
Combine grains in a mixing bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a
2-3 qt. casserole which is safe for both stovetop and oven cooking,
and place on med. heat. When hot , saute onion and garlic until
tender and translucent, about 5-6 mins. Add the mixed grains and
saute for 1 min., stirring constantly.

Meanwhile melt butter or margarine (if using) in a separate pan on
med. high heat. When hot , add mushrooms and saute quickly, stirring
frequently, until the shrooms are hot and have just absorbed the
"butter" (about 1 min.). Immediately remove from heat.

Add the broth, herbs, and mushrooms to the casserole with the onions
and grains, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to
taste, cover tightly (use aluminum foil between pot and cover if
necessary for a good seal), and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hr.

NOTES: I use alot less oil (only as much as needed to keep things from
sticking in my cast-iron dutch oven), add hot peppers and fresh herbs
(rosemary is especially delicious; i dislike dried oregano so i use
less or none), add soy sauce instead of salt, and saute the mushrooms
first in the same pan (taking them out when done) so i dont have to
wash two pans :^>. Frankly i can't see where they get 8 servings
from, this lasts me maybe 3 meals....It's really a hearty dish, so
save it for a cold day (some of us still have a few left, despite the
advent of spring). Enjoy!

(8 servings as a side dish, less as an entree)
