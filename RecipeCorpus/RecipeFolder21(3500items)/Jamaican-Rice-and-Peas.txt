Title: Jamaican Rice and Peas
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings    1 c  dried red kidney beans, washed
coconut milk (see NOTE)
1 ea sprigfresh thyme
1 ea clove garlic, crushed
1 ea green onion, chopped
salt, to taste
3 sl hot pepper, such as Scotch Bonnet (optional) 2 1/4 c uncooked
long-grain, regular or parboiled rice In a medium saucepan with a
tight-fitting lid, place the washed beans. Add the coconut milk and
bring to boil.  Reduce the heat. Cook until the beans are tender, 1
to 2 hours. Add the thyme, garlic, green onion, and salt. Add the hot
pepper if desired. Simmer for a few minutes. Add the rice.

The liquid should come up to 1-inch above the rice.  Add water if
needed. Cover the pot.  Bring to a boil again.  Reduce the heat to
low. Cook for 15 minutes (for regular rice) to 20 minutes (for
parboiled). It should not be necessary to add more water, but if to
much liquid boils away, replace it with boiling water.

The rice is ready when the liquid disappears and the grains of rice
are separate.  Stir just before serving to evenly distribute the red
kidney beans. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

NOTE:  For coconut milk, crack 1 mature coconut with a hammer, cut off
the brown shell, and grate the coconut meat.  Into a bowl, add
the coconut meat and 6 cups of water.  Mix well, then squeeze to
extract as much liquid as possible.  Press through a sieve and
use as directed above.

Etoria says his preferred method to separate the coconut
meat from the brown shell is with a butter knife ("or the
dullest knife you have") to prevent cuts.  Slip the knife
between the white flesh and the shell, and it should come
away easily.
