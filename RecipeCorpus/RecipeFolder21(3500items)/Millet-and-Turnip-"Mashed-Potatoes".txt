Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM------------------FORMATTED BY S.GRABOWSKI-----------------------
4 c  Millet
6 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Diced turnips
Wash millet and drain with a fine mesh strainer until water comes
clean. Place millet in a heavy pot and add cooking water. Let soak
4-8 hours or overnight before cooking.

Add salt and diced turnips. Bring to a boil, place heat deflector
under the pot, then simmer over low flame for 45-50 minutes. For a
creamier texture, allow millet to sit in the pot 10 minutes before
uncovering. Mash with a potato masher; if necessary, add a cup of
water while mashing to make a mashed potato consistency. Transfer to
a serving bowl and cover. Serve with an ice cream scoop and top with
gravy.
