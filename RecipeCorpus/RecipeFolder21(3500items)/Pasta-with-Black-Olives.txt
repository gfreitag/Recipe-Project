Title: Pasta with Black Olives
Categories: Vegetarian, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 lb Rigatoni
2 tb Olive oil
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c  Black olives, pitted
- roughly chopped
MMMMM---------------------SWEET PEPPER SAUCE--------------------------
2 lg Red peppers
4    Garlic cloves; peeled
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Cook the rigatoni in a large saucepan until al dente.  Drain
immediately and return the rigatoni to the still-warm pan with the
olive oil; season the pasta to taste with salt and black pepper.

While the pasta is cooking, make the Sweet Pepper Sauce.

Serve the pasta on warmed plates, pour the sauce on top and sprinkle
with the chopped olives.

SWEET PEPPER SAUCE:  Put the peppers into a saucepan with enough
water to almost cover.  Bring to a boil, then simmer until tender.
Remove the peppers from the water, reserve the water and discard the
stems and seeds. Chop and place in a blender or food processor.

Add the garlic to the peppers, together with 1 1/4 cups of the cooking
water, and blend to a puree.

Transfer to a clean saucepan.  Season with salt and pepper and reheat
gently.
