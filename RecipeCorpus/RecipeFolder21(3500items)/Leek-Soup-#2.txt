Heat the butter and oil together in a large casserole or dutch oven.
Add the leeks and stir to coat. Cover. Cook over low heat for 15

Slowly stir in hot chicken stock. Simmer, partially covered, for
about 30 minutes until the flavor develops. Season with the white
pepper and salt, to taste. Serve in mugs with your favorite crackers.
