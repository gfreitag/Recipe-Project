Title: Crab Dip #1
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
24 oz Cream cheese
1 lb Crab meat
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
2 tb Mustard
1 tb Powdered sugar
1 ts Chopped onion
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Sherry
Combine all the ingredients except the sherry in the top half of a
double broiler and heat until creamy. Add sherry to taste; half a cup
is not too much, depending on whether it is to be served from a
chafing dish or as a dip, when the mixture should be slightly thicker.
