SUNFLOWER

Remove all leaves from artichoke. Set aside those that are firm
enough to handle and have a good edible portion on ends. Cut heart
into quarters.

Blend cream cheese with garlic and onion powders, hot pepper
seasoning and enough milk or cream to make a smooth paste. Adjust
seasoning. Spread filling on tip of each reserved leaf. Place small
shrimp on top of filling and dust with paprika. Arrange leaves in
concentric circles on a round tray to resemble open sunflower. Place
cut artichoke heart in center of leaves.

Servings: 4 to 6
