7    Large eggs,
Separated keep at room tempe
1 1/3 c  Sugar
3 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Grated orange rind
4    Very ripe bananas,
Mashed (about 1 1/3 cups)
1 c  Matzah cake  meal
1 c  Coarsely ground almonds
1 ts Salt
In a large bowl, with an electric mixer beat the yolks and they are
thick and pale. Gradually add the sugar, beating until the mixture is
very thick. Beat in the lemon juice and the rind, add the bananas,
the matzah cake meal, the almonds and the salt and beat the mixture
until it is combined well. In a clean dry bowl, with clean dry beater
beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks, stir 1 cup of them
into the banana mixture and fold in the remaining whites gently but
thoroughly, Pour the batter into an ungreased 9" tube pan (3 1/2"
deep) with a removable bottom and bake the torte in the middle of a
preheated 350 oven for 55-60 minutes, or until a tester comes out
clean.

Invert the pan over the neck of a bottle and let the torte cool upside
down. Run a thin knife around the edge and tube of the pan and remove
the side of the pan. Run the knife under the bottom of the torte to
release it and transfer the torte carefully with 2 spatulas to a
serving plate.

I hope you enjoy this as much as I have.
