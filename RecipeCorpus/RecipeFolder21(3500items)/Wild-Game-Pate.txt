First, marinate the strips of game. In a non-reactive bowl, mix
together the marinade ingredients, the cognac, salt and pepper,
thyme, allspice and green onions. Add strips of game and marinate
while preparing stuffing. For stuffing, cook onions slowly in the
butter until tender. Scrape into large mixing bowl. Pour cognac into
same skillet and boil until reduced by half, scraping bottom of
skillet to loosen any pan drippings. Scrape into bowl with onions.
Add pork and veal, beaten eggs, salt, pepper, allspice, thyme and
garlic. Beat vigorously with wooden spoon until thoroughly blended.
To assemble pate, line bottom and sides of laof pan with blanched
bacon (to blanch plunge bacon into boiling water, remove immediately
and drain briefly under cold running water), reserving a few strips
for top of pate. Drain game strips, reserving marinade. Beat marinade
into stuffing. Divide stuffing into three parts. Dip hands in cold
water and arrange first third of the stuffing in bottom of loaf pan.
COver with half the strips of game. Repeat layers, another third of
stuffing and remaining half of game strips. SPread remaining thrid of
stuffing on top. Place bay leaf on top and cover with remaining
blanched bacon. COver top of pan with aluminum foil and set in larger
pan of boiling water (water should come about halfway up the outside
of loaf pan). Bake in oven preheated to 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.
Remove loaf pan from water and place another loaf pan (preferably
glass so it's heavy enough to weight down the pate) on top of
foil-wrapped pate. Cool pate at room temperature several hours or
overnight. Chill, still weighted. Serve in slices with crackers.NOTE:
A "pinch" is about 1/8 ts.
