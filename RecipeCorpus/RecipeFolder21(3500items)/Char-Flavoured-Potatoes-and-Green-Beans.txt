Categories: Main dish, Indian, Vegetable
Yield: 7 servings
2 md Tomatoes, chopped
5 md Potatoes, cubed
2 1/2 c  Green beans, cut into 1 1/2
- inch pieces
1 tb Basil
2 ea Whole dried red chilies
4 ea Sprigs fresh coriander
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/8 ts Asafetida
1 ts Salt
1 ds Black pepper
6 tb Ghee
2 2/3 c  Water
Place all the ingredients into a large heavy bottomed pot in the
order in which they are listed.  Bring to a boil over a moderate
heat, reduce heat & boil for 5 minutes.

Reduce the heat further & gently boil, partially covered, for 20 to 25
minutes.  Check that the water is not evaporating too quickly.  You
may have to add more water.

To finish cooking, raise the heat to fairly high & fry quickly,
without stirring, to allow the crust to form & just begin to char.
Remove from the heat & let stand, covered for 5 minutes.  Stir in the
crust & serve, remembering to remove the red chilies, you may not
want to bite into them. :)
