Title: Stuffed Artichokes
Categories: Italian, Vegetable
Yield: 3 servings
3 lg Artichokes
5 oz Parmesan cheese, grated
1 lg Clove of garlic, minced
1 c  Italian bread crumbs
1/4 c  Olive oil (this needs to
Be olive oil, NO

Lemon juice
Cut the stems and the tops (Just low enough to remove the pointy ends
of the leaves) off of the artichokes. Mix cheese, garlic,and crumbs.
Spread the artichoke leaves so you can fill each layer, from the
outside in, with the crumb mixture.

Place the artichokes in a pot with about 1-2 inches of water.  Drizzle
olive oil and lemon juice over the top of each artichoke. Cover and
steam 45 minutes or longer, checking occasionally that the water has
not completely evaporated. The artichokes are done when a leaf can be
easily pulled off.
