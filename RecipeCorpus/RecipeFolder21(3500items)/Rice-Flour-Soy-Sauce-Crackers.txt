Title: Rice-Flour-Soy Sauce Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 80 servings
1 c  Rice flour
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Oil
2 tb Soy sauce or Tamari, to
Taste
1    Egg white, lightly beaten
1/4 c  Buttermilk or rehydrated
Buttermilk powder
"Rice flour gives these simple crackers a slightly grainy texture,
and the soy sauce lends a lovely brown tint. This is just the cracker
to serve as a light afternoon snack with pot of green tea. 325~F. 15
to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Combine the flours in a large bowl or in the food processor. Add the
oil and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in the
soy sauce and egg white. Blend in enough of the buttermilk, little by
little, to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/16 inch thick. With a sharp
knife or a cookie cutter, cut into 2-inch circles or squares. Place
the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
Prick each one with a fork in 2 or 3 places.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp, turning over once during
baking. Cool on a rack. Yield: 70-80.
