Title: Buckwheat Flatbread
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Buckwheat flour
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Water
"Buckwheat flour is available in health food and specialty stores. It
has a musty, earthy flavor which gives an interesting twist to this
simple, traditional flatbread-style cracker. It goes well with fruit
and cheese. In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the
flours and salt. In a slow stream, stir in enough of the water to
form a soft, but not sticky, dough.

Remove to a well-floured surface or pastry cloth and knead lightly.
Cut the dough into 6 equal portions and roll each piece into a large,
thin circle, approximately 1/16 inch thick and 8 inches in diameter.
Prick each circle all over with the tines of a fork.

To cook, gently place the circles, one at a time, on a hot griddle or
saute pan. Cook over medium heat until pale brown spots begin to
develop on the underside of the cracker, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the
cracker to cook the second side. Continue flipping in this manner
until the cracker feels dry and crisp. Remove to a rack to cool. If
upon cooling the cracker remains slightly pliable, you may return it
to the pan for further cooking, or place in a preheated 350~F. oven
for a few minutes, until fully "dried out." Yield: 6.

VARIATIONS: For a crunchier cracker, add 1/3 cup buckwheat groats and
increase the water slightly.

Buckwheat has a strong flavor. According to your taste, you may wish
to increase the all-purpose flour and decrease the amount of
buckwheat.
