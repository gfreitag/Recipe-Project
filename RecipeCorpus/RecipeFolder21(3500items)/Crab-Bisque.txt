Title: Crab Bisque
Categories: Soup/stew, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Crab, in shells
1    Leek, sliced coarsely
1    Carrot, sliced
1    Celery stalk, sliced
2    Shallots, chopped
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 tb Tomato puree
1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 qt Water
1    Chicken bouillon cube
1 pn Saffron
1    Herb bouquet
1 tb Safflower or olive oil
4 tb Cornstarch
4 tb Non-fat powdered milk
4    Basil leaves
1 ts Tarragon, minced
1 tb Chives
1/2 ts Cognac or brandy
Remove meat from shells.  In a large saucepan, heat the oil over
moderate heat, then add the crab shells and cook them.

Stir slowly but continuously for 5 minutes.  Add the vegetables and
tomato puree and cook another 5 minutes, stirring. Add the wine and
bring to a boil for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom to dissolve any
coagulated juices. Add the water, bouillon cube, saffron and herb
bouquet (1/2 ts thyme, 1/2 bay leaf, 5-6 fresh parsley stems, tied in
cheesecloth). Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 hour.

Pour the stock through a fine strainer into a bowl, pressing down on
the vegetables and crab shells with a soup ladle to extract all of
the liquid. (For a finer result, strain again through cheesecloth.)

Return the stock to a boil.  Moisten the cornstarch in a little cold
water, then add it to the saucepan and boil for 4 minutes. Taste for
salt and pepper.  (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and
refrigerated.)

Bring stock to a simmer.  Add the crabmeat and cook for 3 minutes.
Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and divide among 4 heated
soup plates.

Pour the stock into a blender, add the powdered milk and cognac. Blend
until smooth and homogeneous.  Pour immediately into the soup plates
over the crabmeat.

Garnish each dish with an equal amount of the herbs.
