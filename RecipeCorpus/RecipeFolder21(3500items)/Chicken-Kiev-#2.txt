Title: Chicken Kiev #2
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Chicken
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Butter
3    Cloves garlic, diced
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/2 ts Mixed vegetable seasoning
2    Chicken breasts
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Scallions, diced fine
3 c  Cracker crumbs
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
In a fry pan, melt butter and saute garlic with lemon juice and
seasoning.

Using flavorizer, inject breasts with butter mix.  (The flavorizer
can be purchased at any kitchen supply store.  It looks much like the
needle a doctor uses for injections, and it's use is also similar.)

Add remaining liquid to eggs and beat.  In a separate bowl, combine
scallions, cracker crumbs, and Parmesan cheese.  Dip breasts in egg
mixture, then into cracker mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 30
minutes.
