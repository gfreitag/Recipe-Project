Categories: Appetizer, French
Yield: 6 servings
18    Snails
1    Bay leaf
1 c  White wine
2 tb Chopped onion
4    Cloves garlic, crushed
1    Dash allspice
1 ts Soy sauce
1/4 ts Vegetable seasoning

Capture 18 snails.  Place them in a ventilated box with corn meal.
With a sprayer bottle, spray the corn meal.  Keep them in this
environment at least 72 hours. Remove the snails and wash them in
cold water. Drop them into boiling water with bay leaf and let simmer
15 minutes. Drain in colander and pick meat out of shell. Remove the
fall or the tail end where the snail is attached to the shell. Wash
snails in cold running water. Set aside. If you prefer, use canned
snails, and rinse in cold water.

In a sauce pan, combine white wine, onion, garlic, allspice, soy
sauce and vegetable seasoning.  Add snails and cook over low heat 10
minutes.  Remove and drain snails, reserving liquid.  To this liquid
add butter, parsley and green onions.  Heat through; add nutmeg.
Place mushroom caps in baking dish, top each with a snail, and pour
liquid over all; bake at 450 degrees for 7 minutes.  Serve
immediately with sliced french bread.
