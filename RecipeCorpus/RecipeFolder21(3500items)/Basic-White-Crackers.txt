Title: Basic White Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 100 servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1 c  Milk
Salt for the tops (opt.)
"These basic crispy crackers go well with soups, salads, dips,
appetizers, and cheese. They will remind you of childhood rainy days
and tomato soup. Preheat the oven to 325~ F. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour and salt.
Cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Slowly mix in enough of the milk to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball. If necessary, add up to 1 additional
Tablespoon of milk.

Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll the crackers paper thin. They will look
almost translucent. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops with salt
and gently roll over the dough with your rolling pin.

With a sharp knife, carefully cut the crackers into 2-inch squares.
Handling them gently, transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet.
Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.
Yield: 95-100.

VARIATIONS: This basic recipe can be the starting point for much
interesting experimentation. Simply varying flour or liquid can
produce an entirely new cracker unavailable anywhere but in your
kitchen.
