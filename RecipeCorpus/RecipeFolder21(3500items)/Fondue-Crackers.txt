Title: Fondue Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 80 servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg
4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/2 lb (8 ounces) Swiss cheese,
Shredded (2 to 2-1/2 cups,
Loosely packed)
1/4 c  Water
"If you want the flavor of cheese fondue, but don't want the fuss and
commotion, try these crackers. You may never bother with the real
thing again. These cheese crackers are very rich, but very light.
They are excellent with a light Alsatian Gewurztraminer or Grey
Riesling. 325~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, mix the flour, salt,
pepper, and nutmeg. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Add the cheese and blend until it is evenly coatd. Blend
in the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface of pastry cloth, roll out to about 3/8 inch thick. Cut into
bite-sized squares (about 1 inch by 1 inch). Arrange on an ungreased
sheet, making sure the edges of the crackers are not touching.

Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the crackers over and continue baking
another 10 to 15 minutes, until medium brown. These crackers should
be crisp. Cool them on racks. Yield: 70-80.

VARIATIONS: For a more traditional fondue taste, add 1 teaspoon
Kirsch or cherry liqueur when adding the water. And use two different
types of Swiss cheese, such as Gruyere and Emmenthaler.
