Butter Frosting: Combine water, yeast and 1 T. sugar. Let stand in
warm place until yeast dissolves and mixture foams. Mix together
nutmeg, flour, cinnamon, salt and margarine as you would for pie
crust. Add egg yolks and yeast mixture. Blend well and form into a
ball.

Divide dough into 4 parts. Roll each into an 8- or 10-inch circle
onto wax paper. Cut into eight to ten wedges. Spread each piece with
mixture of egg white and 1/2 c. sugar and sprinkle with nuts. Roll
from wide end to pointed end to form a horn. Bake on greased cookie
sheet at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes until lightly browned.

To make frosting, combine ingredients and beat until fluffy. Frost
when cooled.

If left unfrosted, can dust with powdered sugar or leave plain. For
non-spiced cookie, omit cinnamon and nutmeg.
