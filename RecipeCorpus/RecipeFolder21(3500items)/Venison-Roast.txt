Contributed to the echo by: Bob Lester Assorted Meat herbs (whatever
you like) Put a LARGE oven cooking bag in an oblong baking pan (so
that the bag fits inside the pan). To the bag, add the venison. Add
all liquids, then veggies around the meat. Put the 'shrooms on top of
everything else, then the spices on top of them. You want to have
about 1 inch of liquid in the bottom of the bag, so if you need more,
add a little water (or white wine!).

Seal bag. Poke several small holes in top of bag to let steam escape.
Bake at 300-325 for 3-1/2 hours. (If you chop the veggies big, they
won't overcook).
