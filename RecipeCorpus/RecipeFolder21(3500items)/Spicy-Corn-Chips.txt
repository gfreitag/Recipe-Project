"The measurements below yield a flavorful, spicy fire cracker. For a
milder or an extra hot cracker, adjust the amount of cayenne, cumin,
and chili powder to taste. These are delightful with a salsa dip.
375~F. 10 to 12 minutes Preheat the oven to 375~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, mix the cornmeal, garlic,
cayenne, cumin, chili powder, and salt. Add the butter and boiling
water and blend well.

Allow the mixture to cool and rest for 10 minutes. It will thicken
slightly.

Slowly blend in the flour, using just enough to form a dough that
will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 3 equal
portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll as
thin as possible, to about 1/16 inch thick. Sprinkle lightly and
evenly with salt and paprika roll over the top of the dough lightly
with the rolling pin.

Cut the dough into 2-inch triangles or squares. Arrange them on an
ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on a rack.

These crackers will crispen as they cool. If they are not crisp enough
after cooling, put them back in the oven for a few minutes longer and
allow them to cool again. Yield: About 150.
