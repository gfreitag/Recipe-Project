"This hearty vegetarian standard takes the place of roast turkey at
White Cloud Inn, in the Pocono Mountains of Penn." Preheat oven to
375. Saute onion and celery in oil.  Put all ingredients into a
greased 11-3/4 " x 7-1/2" baking dish and bake until just firm and
slightly brown on top, about 35 to 40 minuets. Serve with you
favorite sauce or gravy. The Inn uses a mushroom sauce, but the dish
is also good with a tomato sauce or onion gravy. Yield: 5 to 6
servings.
