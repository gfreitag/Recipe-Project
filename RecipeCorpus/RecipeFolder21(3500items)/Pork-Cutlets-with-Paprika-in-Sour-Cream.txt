Title: Pork Cutlets with Paprika in Sour Cream
Categories: Pork, Meat, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 lb Boneless loin or
Tenderloin of pork
Cut into 8 slices
1 ts Sweet paprika
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Onion, chopped fine
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Sour cream
Parsley, chopped for garnish
1. Place the meat on a flat surface and pound with a mallet to flatten
without breaking the meat. 2. Hold a small sieve over the meat and
add the paprika. Tap the sieve, moving it over the meat so that the
slices are evenly coated with paprika. 3. Heat the butter in a
skillet large enough to hold the meat in one layer. Add the meat and
cook over high heat to brown on one side, about 3 min. Turn and brown
on the other side, about 3-4 min. 4. Transfer the slices to a warmed
platter and keep hot. Pour off the fat from the skillet. To the
skillet add the onion. Cook briefly, stirring, until wilted. Add the
wine to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom of the
skillet. Add the chicken broth and simmer about 5 min. 5. Remove the
sauce from the heat and stir in the sour cream. The sauce may be
spooned over the meat now, but it is preferable to put it through a
fine sieve and reheat it briefly before serving. 6. Sprinkle with
parsley.
