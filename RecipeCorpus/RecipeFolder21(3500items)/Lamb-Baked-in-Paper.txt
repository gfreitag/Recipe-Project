Title: Lamb Baked in Paper
Categories: Greek, Meat
Yield: 6 servings
1    Leg of lamb *
2 oz Feta or Kasseri (or more)
1 ts Thyme
1 ts Spearmint flakes
1 ts Oregano
2    Garlic cloves
2    Lemons, juice only
1 tb Salt
Pepper to taste
*Note: Lamb shanks may be substituted for leg of lamb.

Wipe meat with damp cloth. Make incisions with small sharp knife on
all sides of leg or shanks. Insert pieces of garlic clove and cheese.
Rub with lemon juice. Sprinkle with herbs, salt and pepper. Wrap
securely in heavy paper twice. Use greaseproof paper such as cooking
parchment or oil brown paper. (do not use aluminum foil. It prevents
browning.) Tie with string. Bake a leg for 2 1/2 hours in 350 F oven.
Bake 2 hours if using shanks.
