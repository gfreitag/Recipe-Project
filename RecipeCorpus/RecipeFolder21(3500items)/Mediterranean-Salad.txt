1 lg Garlic cloves;finely chopped
1/2 ts -pepper, black, ground
1 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/4 ts Allspice, ground
9 tb Olive oil; extra virgin
""NOTE: After a couple of hours, the croutons will start to absorb the
dressing. Some people like this; others (including the reviewer for
Toronto Life!) do not. Time the addition of the croutons to suit your
taste."

Preheat oven to 350F. Spread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet
& toss with the oil. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown,
turning them every few minutes. They will take 10 to 20 minutes,
depending on how fresh the bread is. Assemble the cucumber, peppers,
green onion and parsley in a large bowl; leave out the tomatoes for
now. Prepare the dressing: Stir the lemon juice, salt and garlic
together until the salt dissolves. Add the pepper, cinnamon and
allspice, then slowly beat in the olive oil. (May be prepared up to
12 hours ahead to this point.) Place the cut up tomatoes on top of
the other vegetables. Pour on the dressing and toss well; add the
croutons and toss again (see note).
