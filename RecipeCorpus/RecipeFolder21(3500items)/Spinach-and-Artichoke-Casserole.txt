If frozen artichokes are used, cook according to instructions. Do not
overcook. Drain the artichokes, and place them on bottom of a 3-quart
casserole. Squeeze as much moisture as possible from the spinach, and
layer it on top of the artichokes. In an electric mixer blend the
cream cheese, mayonnaise, and butter or oil until light and fluffy.
Gradually beat in the milk, and spread this mixture over the top of
the spinach. Sprinkle with pepper and the cheese.

Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees for 40 minutes, or until the top is
lightly browned.

You can refrigerate this dish after putting it together and before
baking it, but if it is chilled, slightly increase the baking time.
