Categories: Pork, Salsa/sauce, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Loin of pork
4 ts Coriander seeds, crushed
1 ts Black peppercorns, crushed
1 ts Brown sugar
1 tb Olive oil
3 c  Dry red wine
3 tb Butter
1/2 c  Coriander leaves, coarse
Chopped
1. Cut the pork into 1-in. cubes and place them in a mixing bowl. Add
1 tsp of the coriander seed, the peppercorns and sugar and stir well
to blend. Cover the bowl and let marinate for a least 20 min. If you
can leave the meat for longer, you will need to pat it dry with a
paper towel befor cooking. 2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large
enough to hold the pork cubes in one layer. When the oil is quite
hot, aromatic and almost smoking, add the meat. Cook, turning often
to brown evenly, about 2-3 min. 3. Add the wine to the skillet and
bring to a boil, stirring. After 1-2 min.,reduce the heat to low and
cook gently, turning the meat occasionally, until the meat is tender
and the wine reduced to about 4 tbsp. This should take about 20 min.
4. Add the butter and the remaining coriander seeds. Increase the
heat to medium high and stir well to mix the melted butter with the
wine for a few sec. Add the coriander leaves, toss to coat the meat
and serve.
