"Very aromatic and delicate, this Armenian Cracker Bread is the
perfect complement to your favorite chicken salad. 350~F. 8 to 12
minutes

In a small bowl, combine the yeast with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and
1/4 cup of the warm water. Set aside in a warm place until the yeast
is dissolved and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Combine the flour, sesame seeds, remaining 1-1/2 teaspoons of sugar,
and salt in a large bowl or the food processor. Stir in the yeast
mixture and mix well. Add enough of the remaining 3/4 to 1 cup warm
water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. The
dough should be smooth and elastic, not sticky.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn over to coat all
sides. Cover with a damp towel and set it in a warm place until it
has doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350~F. Punch the dough down and turn out onto a
lightly floured surface. Knead a few strokes. Cut the dough into 12
equal pieces. Roll each piece into a large circle approximately 7 to
8 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick.

Place the circles on a baking sheet and prick them all over with the
tines of a fork. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, until just barely browned
and crisp. Cool on a rack. Yield: 12.

VARIATIONS: Substitute poppy seeds for the sesame seeds, or omit the
seeds.
