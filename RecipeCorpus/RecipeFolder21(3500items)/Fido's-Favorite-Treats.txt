Yield: 10 servings
1 c  Uncooked Oatmeal
1 ts Bouillon Granules
3/4 c  Powdered milk
1    Egg, Beaten
1/3 c  Margerine
1 1/2 c  Hot Water
3/4 c  Cornmeal
3 c  Whole Wheat Flour
In a large bowl pour hot water over oatmeal, margerine, and bouillon
granules: let stand 5 minutes. Stir in powdered milk, cornmeal and
egg. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.
Knead 3 to 4 minutes, adding more flour if necessary to make a very
stiff dough. Pat or roll dough to 1/2 inch thikness. Cut into bone
shapes and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake in a 325 degree oven
for 50 minutes. Allow to cool and dry out until hard. Makes
