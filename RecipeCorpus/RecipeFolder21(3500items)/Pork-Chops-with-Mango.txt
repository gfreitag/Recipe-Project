1 tb Curry powder, more or less
To taste
1 tb Flour
1 c  Chicken broth
1    Large ripe mango

1. Heat the butter in a skillet large enough to hold the chops
comfortably in one layer. Add the chops and cook over high heat about
2-3 min. or until well browned. Turn the chops and cook the other
side about 2-3 min. Remove the chops and set aside. 2. Add the onion
and garlic to the skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring,
until wilted. Add the curry powder and flour and stir to blend. Cook,
stirring, about 2 min., then gradually stir in the broth. 3. Return
the chops to the skillet. Cover and cook gently about 25 min. 4.
Meanwhile, cut the mango in half along one side of its flat seed. Cut
out the seed as neatly as possible. Peel the mango halves and slice
thinly lenghtwise. 5. Add the mango slices to the skillet and cook
3-4 min. longer or until the mango is heated through. 6. Transfer the
chops and the mango slices to a warmed serving platter and keep hot.
7. Increase the heat under the skillet and cook down the liquid until
reduced by about half. Add the cream and cinnamon and stir to blend.
Bring back to a boil. 8. Pour the sauce over the chops.
