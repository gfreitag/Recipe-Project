1 c  Whole wheat flour
3/4 c  Rolled oats (oatmeal),
Regular or quick cooking
(not instant)
1 ts Salt

"The surprising combination of molasses, sour cream, and oats
produces an intriguing blend of flavors in these hard crackers. Serve
them in place of graham crackers. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the
oven to 350~F.

Stir together the flours, oats, salt, baking soda, and pepper in the
food processor or in a large bowl. Mix well.

In a separate bowl, combine the sour cream, water, and molasses. Mix
well. Add to the dry ingredients and blend to form a dough that will
hold together in a cohesive ball. The dough will be very sticky.

Divide into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a well-floured surface or
pastry cloth, roll out to approximately 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle
lightly and evenly with salt and gently roll over the top with the
rolling pin to press the salt in.

With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares and place them
on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each
square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the edges have turned golden
brown. Yield: 80-90.
