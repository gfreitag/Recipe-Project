Title: Hot Italian Sausage (2)
Categories: Italian, Pork
Yield: 2 servings
2 1/2 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
6    Dried hot red peppers
(each about 1-1/2 inches
Long), seeds removed, OR
2 ts Crushed dried red pepper
Flakes
1 tb Paprika
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1 ts Fennel seeds
1/2 ts Very finely minced garlic
1 3/4 lb Lean, trimmed pork, cut
Into 1-inch dice and
Chilled
1/2 lb Fresh pork fat, cut into
1/2-inch dice and chilled
1. Combine the salt, peppercorns, hot peppers, paprika, thyme, and
fennel in a spice mill or a mortar and grind to a coarse texture, not
a powder. Mix in a small bowl with the garlic. 2. Combine the meat,
fat, and spices in a large bowl. 3. Put half the mixture in the
container of a food processor and process to a medium-coarse grind
(if you are using a meat grinder, follow the directions on page 4,
using the medium disc). The meat and fat should be distinct from each
other, but reduced to pieces of about the same size; do not
overprocess. Scrape into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining
ingredients, then knead the batches together, cover the bowl, and
refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. 4. Stuff the casings as indicated in
the general sausage-making instructions on pages 4-5, tying off the
links at 4 to 5 inches. If weather is cool, hang the sausages for a
few hours, until they are just dry to the touch. If it's too hot or
humid to hang the sausages, simply refrigerate them, uncovered, for a
minimum of 12 hours. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or
freeze for longer storage. TO COOK: Prick the sausages with a needle
and arrange in a single layer in a baking pan. Bake in a 425-degree
oven for 25 minutes, or until browned, tuning often. Or place the
pricked sausages in a large skillet and add 1/4 inch of water. Cook
over moderate heat, turning often, until the water has evaporated and
the sausages are well browned.
