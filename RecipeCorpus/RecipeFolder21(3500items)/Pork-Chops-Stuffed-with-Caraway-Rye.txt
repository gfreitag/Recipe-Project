Title: Pork Chops Stuffed with Caraway Rye
Categories: Pork, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Rye bread with caraway
Seeds, cut into 1/4-in. dice
1/4 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Onion, chopped fine
1/2 ts Garlic, minced
1/4 lb Mushrooms, diced
1/2 c  Parsley, minced
1 ts Caraway seeds
1    Egg, lightly beaten
4    Loin pork chops
Each abut 1-in. thick
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb Red wine vinegar
3/4 c  Chicken broth
1. Preheat the oven to 300. Put the bread cubes in a baking dish and
place in the oven. Bake about 5 min. or until lightly brown. 2.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan and add 1 cup of the chopped
onion, the garlic and the mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until wilted.
Spoon the mixture into a mixing bowl and add the parsley, caraway
seeds, bread cubes and egg. Stir well. 3. Holding a knife parallel to
the surface of the meat, split each chop in half to the bone, top to
bottom, but do not cut entirely through. Place the flaps of each chop
on a flat surface and pound with a mallet. Do not break the flesh or
the stuffing will ooze out. Stuff each chop with equal portions of
stuffing. Flod the flaps together to enclose the stuffing and secure
with wooden toothpicks. 4. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large
enough to hold the chops in one layer without crowding. Add the chops
and cook over moderately high heat about 4 min on each side until
well browned. Continue cooking, turning occasionally, about 15 min.
Transfer the chops to a hot serving dish and keep warm. 5. Pour off
the fat from the skillet and add the remaining onion. Cook, stirring,
about 1 min. then add the vinegar and stir well. Add the broth and
bring to a boil, stirring. 6. Remove the toothpicks from the chops.
Srain the sauce, pushing through the sieve as much of the solids as
possible, and serve.
