1/2 c  Olive oil

Remove crust from bread- preferrably Italian white bread.  In a small
bowl, combine bread and milk.  Let soak 5 minutes.  Squeeze the bread
with your hands to get rid of any excess liquid.  Place bread,
garlic, egg yolks, and lemon juice in blender or food processor
fitted with a steel blade. Process 10 seconds, or until completely
smooth.  With machine running, slowly drizzle in oil until thickened.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

VARIATION: Rouille Add 1 peeled, seeded, roasted red pepper to Aioli
recipe.  Combine in blender or food processor with bread, garlic, egg
yolks, and lemon juice. Follow the rest of the Aioli recipe.

VARIATION: Skordalia Add 1/2 cup finely ground blanched almonds and 2
tbsp chopped parsley to one Aioli recipe.

At a true Provencal feast, Aioli is served with mounds of boiled
vegetables ~ leeks, cauliflower, green beans - boiled eggs, poached
flaky salt-cod, and crusty French bread.  Or the dip may accompany
sea snails or bourride - a Provencal fish stew.
