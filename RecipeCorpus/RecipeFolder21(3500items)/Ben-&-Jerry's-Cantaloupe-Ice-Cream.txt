Categories: Ice cream, Fruit, Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Cantaloupe, very ripe
1    Lemon; juice of
Sweet cream base #1
This is one of Jerry's Favorite flavors, but they never figured out
how to make it in large batches. It's sold only in their downtown
store. Cut the cantaloupe in half and clean out the seeds. Scoop the
fruit into a mixing bowl, add the lemon juice, and mash until the
fruit is purred. Drain the juice into another bowl and reserve. Cover
the melon puree and refrigerate. Prepare the sweet cream base and
whisk in the fruit juice. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker
and freeze following the manufacturer's instructions. After the ice
cream stiffens, about 2 minutes before it is done, add the
cantaloupe. if more juice has accumulated, do not pour it in because
it will water down the ice cream. Continue freeziung until the ice
cream is ready. Makes 1 generous quart.
Variation: COCONUT CANTALOUPE: Use half the amount of cantaloupe and
lemon juice asked for in step 1. Add 1 cup coconut cream, such as
Coco Lopez, to the Sweet cream Base in step 2. Complete the recipe as
directed.
