Title: Basque Potato Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Italian Sausage
1/2 c  Chopped onion
2 lb Canned tomatoes
6 c  Pared and diced potatoes (4)
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
1 c  Sliced celery
2 tb Chopped celery leaves
1 1/2 c  Water
2    Beef bouillon cubes
1    Bay leaf
1 tb Salt
1/2 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Pepper
1 tb Lemon juice
In large saucepan or kettle, brown sausage over medium heat. Add
onion and cook for 5 minutes.

Add remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
uncovered 40 minutes or until potatoes are tender.

A little tabasco sauce to taste is good with this.  It actually
improves in flavor as a leftover.

Enjoy! Gloria Martin
