Title: Siopow (Steamed Dumplings)
Categories: Asian, Appetizer
Yield: 30 servings
1    Wrapper recipe
1 c  Water
1 tb Oil
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Chopped shrimp
1/4 c  Ground pork
1 c  Minced water chestnuts
1/4 c  Minced scallions
1/4 c  Minced onions
1    Egg
1 ts Pepper
1 ts Salt
Boil wrapper. Remove from heat and pour in 1 1/2 cup flour and beat
until it forms a ball.  Divide into 1 1/4 inch balls and roll each
until paper thin.  Spoon 1 tbls. mixture into each wrapper, fold and
seal. Arrange in steamer and steam 30 minutes.

Again some expanation... these can be made with much thicker
wrappers (the ones the street vendors sell are more like 1/2 to 1
inch thick) and the filling can be just about anything.  I have done
these with leftover meat and a few vegetables ... such as mushrooms,
celery etc.
