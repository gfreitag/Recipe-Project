TO COOK PRAWNS: Leaving the shells of the prawns intact, insert the
toothpicks along the inside curves to prevent curling. Drop the prawn
into 3/4 pt of boiling water and cook briskly, uncovered, for about 3
minutes until pink and firm. Drain in a sieve and cool quickly under
cold running water.  Remove the toothpicks and peel the prawns,
leaving the last section of shell and tail on each one. De-vein the
prawns by making a shallow incision  across their tops with a small,
sharp knife. Lift out the vein. Butterfly the prawns by cutting along
their inner curves 3/4 of the way through, spreading the open and
flattening with a cleaver. MARINADE Put the vinegar, water, salt,
sugar and MSG into a mixing bowl and stir together thoroughly.  Add
the prawns, marinade at room temperature for 1 hour. FILLING Drop the
egg yolks into a small saucepan and beat lightly with a fork. Remove
2 1/2 t of the yolks and set aside.
Add 3/4 pt of water to the remaining yolks, stir thoroughly, and
cook over a moderate heat for 10-15 minutes until the yolks are firm
and hard-boiled.  Drain them in a sieve, and mash them into a paste.
Beat the sugar, salt, salt, lemon juice, MSG, and the rest of the raw
egg yolks and continue to beat.  Rub the mixture through a fine
sieve. TO ASSEMBLE AND SERVE Divide the seasoned egg filling into 6
equal parts and pack each part into the center of a prawn. Seal the
edges by pressing them together. Serve at room temperature.
