Categories: Chinese, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Boned,skinned chicken breast
2 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
2 md Garlic cloves
- peeled and minced
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Sweet port or Sherry
-=OR=- Madeira
3 tb Sesame oil
1 ts Chili oil
1 1/2 lb Asparagus
1 md Yellow onion
1 md Red bell pepper
1 ts Cornstarch; blended with
1/4 c  Chicken broth
POUND THE CHICKEN BREASTS as you would for scaloppine, then slice them
crosswise at 1/2-inch intervals. Marinate chicken for 30 minutes at
room temperature in a mixture of the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, port
and 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. Trim the coarse stem ends from
the asparagus. Peel the asparagus and slice them crosswise, slightly
on the diagonal, into 1-inch lengths. Peel and halve the onion, then
cut each half into thin slices. Core, seed and slice the red bell
pepper lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips. Set a wok or large skillet
over high heat. Add the chili oil and 1 tablespoon of the remaining
sesame oil and heat the oil for about 1 minute, until ripples appear
on the wok bottom. Add the onion and red pepper and stir-fry the
mixture for 1 minute. Cover the wok and allow the mixture to steam
for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables from the
wok to a heatproof plate. Add the remaining sesame oil to the wok,
pour in the chicken and marinade, and stir-fry over high heat for 2
minutes. Blend in the cornstarch mixture, stirring it for about 1
minute, until the sauce has thickened and becomes clear. Return the
vegetables to the wok, toss the mixture lightly for about 30 seconds,
and serve. Accompany the chicken with fluffy boiled rice.
