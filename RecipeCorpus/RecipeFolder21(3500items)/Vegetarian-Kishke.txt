Kishke traditionally is prepared by stuffing a seasoned mixture of
flour, onion and meat into casings.  This recipe is a flavorful
vegetarian version.

Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Spoon half of the mixture onto a
piece of aluminum foil and roll into a cylinder.  Repeat with
remaining mixture.

Place cylinders on a cookie sheet or baking pan.  Bake at 350 degrees
for 45 minutes.  Turn cylinders upside down and cook for an
additional 45 minutes.  Remove and discard foil.
