1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Barley miso
1/2 c  Mirin
1/4 c  Plum sauce
1 tb Brown sugar
4    Atsu age cakes

In a small saucepan, whisk together arrowroot and water.  Heat and add
miso, mirin, plum sauce and brown sugar.  Stir and continue cooking
until thickened, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool.

Slice each eggplant in half lengthwise and trim ends from green
onions. Wipe shiitake mushrooms with a damp towel to remove dirt.
Set aside.

Brush grill with oil to prevent sticking.  Cook tofu over medium-hot
coals 7 to 8 minutes each side until edges start to crisp.  While
tofu grills, place whole green onions, shiitake mushrooms and
eggplant (cut-side down) on grill and cook 5 minutes.  Turn and baste
with miso sauce.  Continue cooking 5 to 8 minutes until eggplant can
be pierced easily with a fork. Serve with extra sauce.
