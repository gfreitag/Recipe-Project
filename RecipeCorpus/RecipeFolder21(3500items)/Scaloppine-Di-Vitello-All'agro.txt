Title: Scaloppine Di Vitello All'agro
Categories: Italian, Meat
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Veal scaloppine
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
1/4 c  Butter
1 tb Olive oil
Juice of 2 lemons
3 tb Chopped parsley
2    Garlic cloves - chopped
2 tb Capers
Place scaloppine between 2 pieces of waxed paper and pound until
thin. When pounding meat do not use a straight up-and-down movement.
Use a sliding action so meat is stretched more than flattened (I use
the edge of a saucer for this).  Coat meat lightly with flour.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter with oil in
a large heavy skillet. When butter foams, add veal.  Cook over high
heat about 1 minute on each side. Veal should be light golden outside
and pink inside.
Place veal on a warm platter.  Add 1 tablespoon butter and lemon
juice to skillet.  Deglaze skillet by stirring to disolve meat juices
attached to bottom of skillet.  Stir in parsley, garlic and capers.
Taste and adjust sauce for seasoning, then spoon over veal. Serve
immediately.
