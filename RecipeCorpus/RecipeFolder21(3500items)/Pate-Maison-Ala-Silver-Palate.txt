Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 10 servings
2 sm Celery ribs with leaves
4    Whole peppercorns
6 c  Water
1 ts Salt
1 lb Chicken livers
Tiny pinch of cayenne pepper
1/2 lb (2 sticks) sweet butter
2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/4 c  Roughly chopped onion
1 sm Garlic clove
1/4 c  Calvados
1/2 c  Dried currants
1.  Add celery and peppercorns to 6 cups water in a saucepan. Add the
salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

2.  Add chicken livers and simmer very gently for about 10 minutes;
livers should still be pink inside (slightly).

3.  Drain; discard celery and peppercorns, and place livers in the
bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add remaining
ingredients except currants and process until well blended and very
smooth.

4.  Scrape into a bowl, stir in currants, and transfer pate to a 3-4
cup crock or terrine. Smooth the top of the pate, cover, and
refrigerate at least 4 hours. Allow the pate to stand at room temp
for about 30 minutes before serving.

About 3 cups pate, or 8+ servings
