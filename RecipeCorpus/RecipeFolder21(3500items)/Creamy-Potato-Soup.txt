Title: Creamy Potato Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Unsalted butter
2    Onions, chopped
1    Leek, white part only,
Thinly sliced
3    Ribs celery, diced
4    Waxy boiling potatoes,
Peeled and diced
1 ts Sweet paprika
6 c  Chicken broth
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1 sm Bay leaf
5    Sprigs parsley tied
Together with
Kitchen string
1 ts Worchestershire sauce
3/4 c  Heavy cream
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Minced fresh parsley leaves
(optional)
Place the butter and onion in a large soup kettle, set over low heat
and cook until onions have softened, about 5 t 8 minutes. Increase
the heat to medium, add the leek and stir-cook 1 minute. Add the
potatoes and paprika; stir-cook 30 seconds. Stir in the broth, thyme,
herb bundle, and Worchestershire sauce. Bring the soup base to a
boil, then cover and simmer 50 minutes, or until the potatoes are
tender. Scoop out about 1 cup of the vegetables and mash them; then
return them to the pot. Discard the herb bundle. (The soup may be
prepared in advance up to this point.) Stir in the heavy cream,
season with salt and pepper to taste, and let the soup cook without
simmering until hot throughout. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve
immediately.
