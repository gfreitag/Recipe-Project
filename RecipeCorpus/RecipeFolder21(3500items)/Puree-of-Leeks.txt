Title: Puree of Leeks

Yield: 4 servings
3/4 lb Leeks; very thinly sliced
Butter
Drop the thinly sliced leeks (tender green parts as well as white)
into 1/2-inch fast-boiling salted water.  Cook until very tender.
Save the cooking liquor.  Whizz the leeks to a smooth, pale green
puree.  Season, enrich with knobs of butter and thin with a little of
the cooking liquor if liked.  Serve garnished with a bouquet of green
coriander and triangles of fried bread.  Add some soft-boiled eggs
for a quick vegetarian supper.
