Peel the shrimp and boil the shells in 1 gallon water with the scraps
from chopping the onion and celery and 2 teaspoons salt. Reduce the
liquid to 1/4 or about 1 quart of stock and strain. Blanch the shrimp
in the stock. Do not overcook. Strain and reserve shrimp and stock
for soup. Saute the celery, carrots and onion. Add black pepper,
curry powder, chili powder, thyme and chopped garlic. Add flour and
mix well. Gradually add 1 quart of hot shrimp and stock and simmer
for about 15 minutes on low heat. Add diced tomato, green pepper and
potatoes to stock mixture and continue to simmer until potatoes are
tender. Add salt to taste and rock shrimp just before serving. Serve
topped with oyster crackers and fresh chopped parsley.
