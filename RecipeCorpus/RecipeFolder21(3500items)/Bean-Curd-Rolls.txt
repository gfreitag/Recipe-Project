To make rolls, spread about 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of filling

to prevent drying. Fold bottom corner over filling to cover, then
fold over right & left corners.  Roll over once to enclose filling.

rest of the rolls.

Add rolls two at a time & cook for 2 minutes on each side, or till
golden brown.  Transfer to a heat proof dish & keep warm in a 200F
oven while cooking remaining rolls.

To serve, cut each roll into thirds.
