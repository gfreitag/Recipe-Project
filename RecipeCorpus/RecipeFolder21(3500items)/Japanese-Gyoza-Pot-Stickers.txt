Chop cabbage fine, place in colander and pour boiling water over the

out. In a bowl mix cabbage, chopped green onions, chopped mushrooms
and grated ginger. Mix ground beef, wine, soy sauce, sesame oil and
black pepper together with vegetables; mix well. Place a small amount
of filling (about 1 ts) in center of gyoza wrapping and fold in half.
Pleat edge to seal. If edges won't stick together, dampen the inside
edge with a little water, then pleat. Put 2 Tb salad oil in heated
skillet (on medium heat). Place gyozas in skillet, close together and
fry until golden brown. Then, at edge of pan, pour in a little water,
up to 1/4 of the depth of the pot-stickers. Cover, turn heat to low
and simmer until water is gone. Serve with dipping sauce as
appetizer, or with hot rice as entree. SAUCE: Mix soy sauce with
chili sesame oil. Use a proportion of 10parts soy sauce to 1 part
oil; if you use a 5 to 1 proportion it may be a little hot for most
people. The authentic sauce is a 2 to 1 proportion.
