Traditionally concannon was eaten at Halloween.  A heaping portion is
dished onto each plate.  A well is made in the center of the mount to
hold a generous portion of butter.  The colcannon is eaten from
around the outside in.  You take a scoop, dip it in the well of
butter in the center and eat.  With a glass of buttermilk, the WAS a
meal in itself.  In the Midlands, colcannon is called "thump".  In
the north and western parts of Ireland it is called "champ".  To tell
fortunes on Halloween, a ring and a silver coin were mixed into the
colcannon...whoever got the ring was soon to marry and whoever got
the coin would be wealthy.
