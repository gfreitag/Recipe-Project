Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 lb Dried red beans
Water
1 c  Dry red wine (opt)
3    Large onions, chopped
1 tb Garlic chopped
1/2 c  Finely chopped parsley
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
1/4 c  Bacon drippings
1    Ham bone and scraps (hocks)
10 c  Ham stock or water
Salt to taste
Tabasco sauce to taste
Prepare the beans the night before.  Clean and pick through beans to
remove foreign objects.  Rinse several times in water to make sure
beans are absolutely clean.  In a lge. mixing bowl, combine the
beans, with enough water to cover by 1 inch, and the wine, onions,
garlic, parsley and green onions.  Soak overnight, covered. Next
morning, saute the hambone and scraps in the bacon drippings, in an 8
qt. pot. Pour the beans, with soaking water and all the seasonings,
into the pot, then add enough stock to cover the beans by 2 inches;
bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer for 2 hrs.,
stirring occasionally so the beans won't stick and burn.  Season with
salt and hot sauce when the beans are tender. To make beans thicker,
remove about a cup full, mash, and return to the pot. Stir in.  Serve
over hot cooked rice.
