To make coconut milk: Blend 2 cups fresh or frozen grated coconut with
water. Strain through double cheesecloth, pressing out all liquid.
This is thick coconut milk. To get thin milk, add warm water to
residue from first straining. Let stand 5 minutes, then press as
before.

For coconut cream, refrigerate first pressing and cream will rise to
top. Refrigerate or freeze. Two cups coconut makes 3 cups thick milk,
of which 6 tablespoons is cream.
