Title: Cheese Chili Bites
Categories: Appetizer, Snack
Yield: 20 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Hot chili powder
1 lg Pinch cayenne pepper
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1/2 c  Finely grated Cheddar cheese
1    Egg, beaten
1 tb Cold water
1 tb Sesame seeds
1 tb Poppy seeds
Preheat oven to 400'F. (205'C.). Sift flour, salt and spices into a
bowl.

Cut in butter finely until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add grated
cheese and mix well. Mix egg with cold water. Add 2 tablespoons of
egg mixture to cheese mixture and mix to form a fairly stiff dough.
Knead gently on a lightly floured surface. Roll out dough to a 12x6"
rectangle. Trim edges. Cut in half lengthwise and transfer to a
baking sheet.

Breush each half with remaining egg mixture. Sprinkle 1 half with
sesame seeds and the other half with poppy seeds. Cut each half in 10
triangles and separate slightly to prevent sticking. Bake in
preheated oven 10-12 minutes or until light golden and cooked
through. Cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container up to 2
weeks.
