Title: Vegetarian Ginger Snaps
Categories: Cake/cookie, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Shortening
1 c  White sugar
2 ts White vinegar
1/2 c  Molasses
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon
2 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Nutmeg
2 c  White flour
Beat shortening till fluffy.  Add sugar & continue to beat until well
combined.  Add the rest of the ingredients in order, beating well
after each addition.  When the ingredients are well mixed, wrap the
mixture in waxed paper & refrigerate for 1 hour to make the dough
easier to handle.

On a floured board, roll out the dough until it is about an 1/8 inch
thick. Using a cookie cutter, cut into cookies & place on a cookie
sheet. Bake 8 to 10 minutes at 275F.  Cool for a couple of minutes on
the sheet & then remove to a wire rack to cool.
