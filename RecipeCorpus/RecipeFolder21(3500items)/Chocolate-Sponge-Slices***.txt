1 c  Mascarpone
1/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Brandy
11 oz Chocolate (your preference-

Beat the mascarpone, sugar and brandy with a wooden spoon. Cut a
sponge cake into little rectangles. Spread with mascarpone mixture
and top with another slice of cake to make a sandwich. Lightly press
together. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate with water. Remove
from heat and before it cools dip the little sandwiches and coat on
all sides. Use a fork to hold and a spoon to drip the choc. to cover
all spots. Place on serving dish and sprinkle with the chopped nuts.
Refrigerate to harden outside. Serve almost at room temp.
