and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Place the blanched vegetables in
a large, shallow baking dish, add the rest of the ingredients,
including the remaining chopped garlic. Toss lightly, then spread the
tomatoes on the surface. Cover and bake in a preheated 500 F oven
until vegetables are cooked, about 20 minutes.  Do not overcook.
