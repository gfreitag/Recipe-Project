Title: CHUCK'S STUFFED ZUCCHINI
Categories: Stuffing, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2 c  Anasazi beans -- soaked
Overnight
1/2 c  Brown rice
1/2 c  Wild rice
4 c  Water
1 lb Zucchini squash -- (1
Large)
Reserved seeds and pulp
5    Dates
1    Stalk celery
Parsley
1 sm Italian zucchini
1    Carrot
1    Green onion
1    Roma tomato
1 tb Curry powder
1/4 ts Mace
1 ts Honey
1/8 ts Cinnamon -- or more
Salt and pepper -- to taste
1/2 c  Monterey jack cheese --
Grated
1> Cook the Rice and Beans together in the water (bring to a boil;
cover, reduce heat, simmer 35-45 mins). Stir occasionally and add
water as needed. Meanwhile... 2> Cut the ends off the zucchini; cut
in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and pulp, chop and transfer
to a medium mixing bowl. 3> Cut, chop or dice the other vegetables to
a coarse slaw. Check the refrigerator for odds and ends.You might add
some apple; a leek instead of the spring onion. Skip the tomatoand
add red bell pepper for color. Crunchy jicama or the bite of a radish
~- be creative. 4> Mix the spices together in a separate bowl and
toss HALF the blend with the vegetable slaw. Add the rice and beans
to this mixture and stir to blend. Taste, adjust with salt and
pepper. 5> Prepare an oblong baking pan (line with foil, or spray).
Mound the stuffing into each zucchini "boat." Extra stuffing can be
scattered between the boats; this 'extra' may needwater during
baking. Sprinkle with grated cheese. Sprinkle top with the remaining
HALF of the spices (a sifter works well).

BAKE 350F for 30 minutes.  Turn off heat and cover. Go to the party.
Keep it warm but don't overcook: the big zucchini is hollowed out yet
what pulp remains should be firm.

Pat's note:  I think the foil was necessary not just to keep the dish
warm but to retain moisture.
