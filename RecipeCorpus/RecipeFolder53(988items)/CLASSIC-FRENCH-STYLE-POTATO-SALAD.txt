Title: CLASSIC FRENCH-STYLE POTATO SALAD
Categories: French, Potatoes, Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Yukon Gold Potatoes;
-scrubbed, not peeled
3 2/3 c  Dry white wine
Salt; to taste
White pepper to taste;
-freshly ground
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1 tb Shallots; minced
2/3 c  Scallions; chopped
Boil the whole unpeeled potatoes in generously salted water until fork
tender, 20-30 minutes, depending on size.  As soon as you can handle
the potatoes, but while they're still warm, slice them just under 1/2
inch thick with a very sharp knife.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, boil the wine until it's
reduced by half.  Sprinkle the salt, pepper, and hot reduced wine
over the warm potatoes; toss gently.  Add the olive oil, tossing just
until combined, and then add the shallots and scallions.  Taste and
adjust the seasonings. Serve at room temperature.

VARIATIONS

Follow the basic recipe above - just omit the scallions - and
substitute one of the following combinations.

Chopped tomato, diced crisp bacon, and hard cooked egg.

Chopped anchovies and sliced roasted red peppers.

Chopped olives, minced garlic, and cubed chicken or turkey.

Paprika, capers, and smoked salmon (To avoid cooking the salmon,
don't add it until the salmon is at room temperature).
