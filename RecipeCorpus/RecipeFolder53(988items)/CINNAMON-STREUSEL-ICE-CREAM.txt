3    Egg yolks
2 c  Whipping cream
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE STREUSEL---------------------------
1/2 c  Light brown sugar, packed

1/4 c  Butter
FOR THE ICE CREAM: 1.In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks until slightly
thickened. Set aside.
2.In a saucepan, combine cream, milk, and sugar. Bring to a gentle
boil over medium high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Whisk about 1
cup of the hot mixture into the egg yolks, then whisk the egg yolk
mixture back into the pan.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the
mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Pour through a
fine sieve into a large bowl. Stir in vanilla. Cool slightly. Then,
cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up
to 2 days.
3.Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's
instructions.
Transfer ice cream to a freezer container and gently stir in cinnamon
streusel just until marbleized. Cover lightly and freeze 1/2 to 2
hours before serving.
Note: To add extra smoothness and volume to homemade ice cream, make
the mixture a day ahead and refrigerate. After churning, ripen the
ice cream in an airtight container in the freezer from 1/2 to 2 hours.
FOR THE STREUSEL: 1.Preheat oven to 300F.
2.In a medium bowl, mix the brown sugar with the flour and cinnamon.
Using knives or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture
is crumbly.
3.Spread evenly on a baking sheet, and bake 5 minutes. Stir several
times while baking, watching to be sure the topping does not burn.
Cool, then break up any large clumps that may have formed. -----
