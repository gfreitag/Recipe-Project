Title: CINNAMON-RAISIN BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Batch
6    Eggwhites
1 tb Vanilla
1 c  Sugar
2 c  Flour
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Raisins
Variations:

for Almond-Cocoa Biscotti: (omit cinnamon and raisins) add 3/4cup
slivered, toasted almonds, 2t almond extract and 1/3 cup cocoa

for Orange-Pistascio Biscotti: (omit cinnamon and raisins) add 3/4cup
toasted pistaccio nuts, 1T orange zest, 2T orange juice conc (the
frozen stuff), and you may need a little extra flour.

Beat egg whites and extracts (and orange juice, if using) together
well. Combine all the dry ingred. and add to the egg and mix well.
Fold in the raisins or nuts. The dough should be firm, but not too
stiff. You may need to add as much as 1/4cup more flour if your egg
whites were large or you are using the orange juice.

Divide the dough in half and shape each into a 'log' about 2" wide and
10"long.  Place each on a greased cookie sheet and bake in a
preheated oven at 325F for 25-30 min.

They should be firm to the touch, but not too brown. Remove from the
oven and turn down the temp to 250F.

Slice each olg into 20-24 pieces and place upright (if you can balance
them!) on the cookie sheets. Return to the oven for about 30-40 min.
The thicker the slices, the longer it takes, but they should not
brown too much more.  Cool them COMPLETELY before storing them in an
airtight container.

The cinnamon/raisin ones have only a trace of fat per cookie and the
ones with nuts have 1.5g fat per cookie.

These are VERY crunchie and you really do need some tea or a nice skim
capiccino to dunk them in! Submitted By RHOMMEL
