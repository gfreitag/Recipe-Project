Title: CINNAMON NUT BISCUITS - *P COOKING CLASS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
3/4 c  Milk
3 tb Melted butter
1/2 c  Firmly packed dark brown sug
3/4 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 450F. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt
in a large mixing bowl. Cut in the vegetable shortening using a
pastry blender or two knives until the mixture has the consistency of
coarse crumbs. Add the milk, adding more milk if necessary so the
dough is pliable but is still wet. Turn the dough onto a heavily
floured surface, and knead it lightly (8 to 10 times). Do not
overwork the dough. Roll the dough into a rectangle 1/3-inch thick.
Mix the melted butter with the brown sugar, cinnamon and nuts. Press
the mixture into one half of the dough, then fold the dough over to
encase the filling, pressing it lightly to adhere. Cut out biscuits
with a 2-inch round cutter (the diameter of a juice can), dipping the
cutter in flour between cutting each biscuit so they do not stick.
Place the biscuits on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake in the
center of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve
immediately, or bake up to 2 hours in advance and reheat for 5
minutes in a 300F oven. Makes 12 to 14. These biscuits are delicious
served warm with sweet butter or apple butter.
