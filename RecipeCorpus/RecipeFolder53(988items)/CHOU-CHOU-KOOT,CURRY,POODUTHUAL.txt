Title: CHOU-CHOU KOOT/CURRY/POODUTHUAL
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 md Chayote squash
1/2 c  Shredded coconut
2    Green chillies, crushed
Turmeric; to taste
Salt; to taste
Mustard
1    Red chilli
Urad dal
Oil; (seasoning)
Curry leaves; (seasoning)
Peel skin of squash. Cube. Cook with a little water, turmeric and
salt. When done yet firm, add coconut and green chilli mix. Pour
seasoning on top. If there's more liquid it becomes kootu, if moist
but not liquidy then poduthual.

Variations:

Can do plaintanos (raw, green or, if not there, very, very green
chiquita bananas) for a vazhakai poduthual/thoran. Also can do red
pumpkin/butternut squash similarly.

An excellent and quick ckakka thoran is also possible. A Thai canned
product is green jackfruit, already cooked. Just shred this by hand,
prepare seasoning in 5-6 tablespoons oil and toss crushed coconut and
green chillies in. Salt. Stir well and remove when thoroughly heated
through and still moist. This dish needs a fair amount of coconut,
and the fresh one is preferred.
