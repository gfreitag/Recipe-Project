Mince the dates, apples and onions and place in a large pan. Add the
sultanas and stir in the sugar.

Add all the other ingredients and stir well, but make sure the bag of

Remove the bag of spices and ginger.  Bottle and store in a coolish
place. Eat.

NOTES:

*  An easy chutney with no cooking -- This recipe filtered down to me
through a grapevine of neighbours. You will need a supply of jam-jars,
jam-jar covers and a large pan to keep the ingredients in. Yield:
Makes several jars.

*  I sometimes use currents in place of the stoneless dates, in which
case you don't need to mince them. If the mixture appears too liquid
after the 24 hour standing time, it is worth draining off some of the
vinegar before bottling.

*  The beauty of this recipe is that you don't have a vast pot of
strange things bubbling away on the stove for hours. A big win!

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  25 minutes preparation, 24 hours standing time.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK, but don't go overboard with
the vinegar.
