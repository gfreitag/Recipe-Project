1. Combine flour, salt, baking powder, 1 egg, sugar, & butter; mix
well. 2. Gradually add enough wine to make a firm dough. Knead until
smooth & elastic. Roll into very thin sheets; cut into 12 squares. 3.
Place metal cannoli tubes diagonally onto each square so tube divides
each square into 2 triangles. Lay points of triangles over tubes so
they meet in middle. Separate remaining egg & use a little of the egg
white to moisten overlap. Press gently to seal. 4. Heat 3-4 inches
deep olive oil in deep pan. Fry cannoli until golden brown, drain
well on paper towels, & cool. Remove metal tubes. 5. Combine
remaining part of egg with ricottta cheese, orange flower water,
candied orange, & chocolate & blend well. Fill cannoli with cheese
mixture. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.
