Title: CINNABON CINNAMON ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Desserts, Breadmaker
Yield: 12 Servings
4 tb Melted butter
4 tb Water
1/2    Box instant vanilla pudding
-(1/2 of a 3.4oz. box)
1 c  Milk
1    Egg; (beaten)
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Bread flour
2 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
-Fill with:
1/2 c  Softened butter
1 c  Brown sugar
2 ts Cinnamon
ROLLS: Place ingredients in machine following the specifications of
that particular machine.  Set for dough cycle (about 1 hr. 40 minutes
in my Hitachi B101 ~ Debbie Carlson). After complete on dough cycle,
remove from machine & roll out to 17 x 10 (approx) rectangle.

FILLING: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread softened
butter over dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over
top. Roll tightly from long end, pinching edges closed when
completely rolled. Slice rolled dough into 1/2" slices (or larger if
a larger bun is preferred ).Place into greased cake pans. ( I use 3 -
9" pans ) I usually get 19 - 20 buns from this. Let rise until
doubled. Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes, until golden. Do not
overbake. FROST with: 4 oz cream cheese (softened) 1/4 C butter
(softened) 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1 1/2 tsp milk

SPREAD on very warm rolls.  They are best when eaten fresh, but we
have found that 10 - 15 seconds in the microwave rejuvenates them!

Note:  I made these in my Hitachi B101 and the dough turned out
beautifully!  I added chopped nuts to the filling though and doubled
the cinnamon.  I also sliced my rolls about 1" and placed them in a
non-stick 13x9" baking pan which rendered about 10 large rolls. Also,
because I don't care for a cream cheese frosting, I used 3 cups
powdered sugar, 4 Tbsp. softened butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and about 3
Tbsp. milk which made lots of frosting, perhaps too much. (Debbie
