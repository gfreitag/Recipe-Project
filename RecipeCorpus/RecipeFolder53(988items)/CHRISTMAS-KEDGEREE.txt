Title: CHRISTMAS KEDGEREE
Categories: Breakfast, Holiday, Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
4 tb Butter
2 c  Cooked rice
2 c  Smoked yellowfish
3/4 c  Heavy cream
1 ts Curry powder
Salt to taste
4    Hard boiled eggs
3 tb Chopped parsley
CHRISTMAS EVE PREPERATION  (20 MINUTES) 1. Prepare hard boiled eggs.
Cook rice, fluff gently and refrigerate. 2. Prepare fish. You can use
any fish or shell fish but I use thick
slabs of smoked yellowfish, or thick slabs of smoked haddock. Thin
fillets tend to break up into pieces too small. Place fish in pan,
cover with water, and heat gently until just before boiling point.
Drain and refrigerate. Allowing fish to boil will turn it into
mush
during final cooking. CHRISTMAS MORNING PREPERATION (15 MINUTES)
1. In a microwave dish or double boiler, melt butter and heat cream
(reserving 3 T for moisture adjustment). Add cooked rice and mix
well. 2.  Gently break cold fish into bite size pieces and add to
mixture.
Chop hard boiled eggs and add to mixture. 3. Adjust moisture
before heating mixture. Microwave mixture should be
moist but not damp. If using doubleboiler to heat mixture, add
reserved
cream until mixture is slightly sloppy or it will dry out during
heating. 4. Heat mixture in microwave on high, stirring every
minute until hot.
Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.
