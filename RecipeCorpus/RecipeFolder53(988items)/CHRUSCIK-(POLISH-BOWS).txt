Title: CHRUSCIK (POLISH BOWS)
Categories: Polish, Cookies
Yield: 8 Servings
9    Egg yolks
3 tb Sour cream
1 tb Rum
1 ts Vanilla
1    Confectioners sugar
3 c  Flour (sifted)
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
1    Oil for deep frying
Beat the egg yolks with the sugar until well combined. Add sour
cream, rum and vanilla and mix until smooth. Sift the flour, baking
powder and salt and add it to egg yolk mixture, a little at a time.
On a heavily floured surface knead the dough vigorously, punching and
squeezing as much flour into it as it will take until the dough is no
longer sticky (1/2 hour). Separate dough into several portions and
roll very thin. Turn the dough and loosen often when rolling. The
dough should look like parchment paper that you can see through. Cut
dough into strips approx. 1 1/2 inches wide, 4 inches long. Make slit
closer to one end and bring the longer end through the slit. Heat oil
to 375 degrees and fry quickly (only a few seconds) until golden not
brown. Turn only once. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners
sugar. Makes
8    dozen.
