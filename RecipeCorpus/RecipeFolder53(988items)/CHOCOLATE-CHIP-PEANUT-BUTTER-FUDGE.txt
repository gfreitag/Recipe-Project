Categories: Candies, Desserts
Yield: 3 Dozen
2 c  Granulated sugar
2/3 c  Milk
2 tb Light corn syrup
1 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1 c  Milk chocolate chips
Combine sugar, milk and corn syrup in a heavy saucepan (3 quart);
bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Continue
boiling without stirring to the soft-ball stage (234 F). Remove from
heat. Add butter, without stirring, and cool to lukewarm (110 F). Add
vanilla and peanut butter; beat until mixture begins to thicken and
lose its gloss. (Watch carefully, this fudge has a short beating
time.) QUICKLY add chocolate pieces, and turn into buttered
8x8x2-inch pan. While warm, mark into squares.  Cool until firm, then
cut as marked.
