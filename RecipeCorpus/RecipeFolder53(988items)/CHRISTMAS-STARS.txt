Categories: Cookies, Christmas
Yield: 3 Dozen
MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
1 c  Solid shortening
-(NOT butter)
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
2    Eggs
1 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Almond flavoring
2 3/4 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
2 tb Cream or milk
1 1/2 ts Vanilla (not Mexican,
-unless you like
-tan frosting)
Food coloring
Cream together the shortening and sugar.  Beat in the eggs, salt and
flavorings.  Stir in the flour until blended. Chill in the
refrigerator for an hour or two.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out on a floured surface to a
thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut with the cookie cutters of
your choice (this was always a cause for argument in our family).
Bake on ungreased cookie sheets until tan around the edges, about
8-10 minutes. Allow to cool.

Make the frosting by beating together the sugar, milk and vanilla
until smooth.  Divide and color each portion. Frost the cookies.

NOTES:

*  Frosted cookie-cutter cookies -- My mom got this recipe many years
ago in a cookbook that came in installments, so it didn't have a name
on the binder and I don't know what it was called. She had us (the
kids) make these cookies every year. Yield: 2-4 dozen.

*  These cookies are about the only ones I know that taste better
cooked and cold than as raw dough.

*  Cinnamon red hots make good eyes for animals or Santas.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 15 minutes rolling
and baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
