Title: CINNAMON ORNAMENTS
Categories: Misc, Gifts, Apples
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Cinnamon
1    Jar applesauce
Drain the moisture from the applesauce for 10 or 15 minutes (or
longer if necessary) by putting it in a colander or strainer which
you've lined with a coffee filter (or something similar). Pour the
whole container of cinammon into a bowl and add just a little
applesauce at a time; stir; keep adding but check carefully each
time; until you have a VERY STIFF dough. Roll out the dough between
two sheets of waxed paper until it's around a quarter inch thick,
then cut it with cookie cutters. Make holes in the dough cutouts with
drinking straws. Put the cookies in a very low oven (only about
175-200 degrees F) for several hours; watch carefully so they don't
burn (if they start to, lower oven). Or you can air-dry them for
several days, turning them over carefully each day. When COMPLETELY
DRY, put ribbons thru the holes and hang on the tree. Submitted By
