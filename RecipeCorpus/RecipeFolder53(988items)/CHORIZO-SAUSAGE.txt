Chorizo is a Mexican sausage that can be used in many ways, chief
among them in breakfast tacos combined with skillet fried potatoes
and/or scrambled eggs. There are many variations - this is my
favorite. You can make it in bulk as it freezes well. Cook as you
would ground beef but on lower heat to avoid burning the spices.
Combine herbs and spices, tequila and vinegar. Add to pork and mix
well.
