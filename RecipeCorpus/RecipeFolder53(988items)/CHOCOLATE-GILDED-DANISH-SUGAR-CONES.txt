Title: CHOCOLATE-GILDED DANISH SUGAR CONES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 16 Servings
1/2 c  Butter or margarine,
-softened
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla
3 oz Bittersweet chocolate
-OR
1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 400'F. Generously grease 4 cookie sheets. Beat butter
and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy. Blend in flour. In
clean, dry bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Blend into butter
mixture with vanilla.

Using measuring teaspoon, place 4 mounds of dough, 4" apart, on each
prepared cookie sheet. Spread mounds with back of spoon dipped in
water to 3" diameter. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, 5-6 minutes or until
edges are just barely golden. (Do not overbake or cookies become
crisp too quickly and are difficult to shape.) Remove from oven and
quickly loosen each cookie from cookie sheet with thin spatula. Shape
each into a cone; cones become firm as they cool. (If cookies become
too firm to shape, return to oven for a few seconds to soften.)

Melt chocolate in small bowl over hot, not boiling, water. Stir until
smooth. When all cookies are baked and cooled, dip flared ends into
melted chocolate. Let stand until chocolate is set. If desired, serve
cones by standing them in a bowl. (Adding about 1" of sugar to bottom
of bowl may be necessary to hold them upright.)

Makes 16 cookies
