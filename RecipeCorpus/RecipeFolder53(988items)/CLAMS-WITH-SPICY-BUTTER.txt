When renowned chef Pierre Franey visited Avery Island, he observed
some age-old local commercial enterprises ~ crawfish farming, oyster
shucking and boudin making ~ with great curiosity and enthusiasm.
Here he brings his incomparable touch to cherrystone clams, best
enjoyed with a loaf of crusty French bread and a carafe of wine. The
southermers defer to the Yankees on this one.
~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Preheat the broiler.  Open the clams and arrange
them neatly on half shells on a baking sheet. In a small bowl, cream
the butter with the remaining ingredients. Spoon the mixture evenly
over the clams. Place them under the broiler for 1 minute. Serve
immediately with French bread.
