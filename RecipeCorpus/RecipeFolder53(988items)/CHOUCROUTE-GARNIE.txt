Polish sausage may be substituted for Italian sausage.

Cover bacon strips with boiling water; set aside  Cut pork into 1"
chunks. Slice knackwurst and Italian sausages in half. Combine pork,
knackwurst, and sausages and set aside. Drain sauerkraut, rinse in
cold water and squeeze dry.  Drain bacon and pat dry. Chop bacon. Mix
into sauerkraut and add crushed juniper berries and gin. Add half of
sauerkraut mixture to crockpot, then add mixed meats and remaining
sauerkraut, sprinkling with pepper as you go. Pour wine over all and
cover. Cook about 2 hours on High.

Turn into warmed serving bowl.  Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with
boiled potatoes.  Pass around mustard  or horseradish, if you wish.

Sylvia's comments: cook on HIGH?  In a crockpot?  Then what's the
point? I cooked it all day on LOW and everything was falling apart. I
have a similar recipe that includes apples and brown sugar that I
like better; this is great for someone who favors bitter tastes, I
served it with applesauce which cut the bitterness well and the
result was delicious.
