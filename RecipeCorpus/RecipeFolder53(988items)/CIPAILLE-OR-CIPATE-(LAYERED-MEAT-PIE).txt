Pastry for double crust pie Cut chicken, beef and pork into 1 inch
cubes and place in a large bowl. Combine with onions; cover and
refrigerate for at least 12 hours or overnight.

Arrange salt pork evenly in the bottom of a 3 quart casserole,
preferably cast iron with a cover.  Layer with 1/3 of the meat
mixture and 1/3 of the potatoes; season with 1/3 of salt, pepper and
spices. Roll out half of the pastry slightly thicker than for a
normal pie and arrange on the potato layer, cutting a small hole in
the centre. Repeat with 2 more layers of meat and potatoes seasoned
with salt, pepper and spices. Cover with remaining pastry, cutting a
small hole in the centre.

Slowly add enough chicken stock through the hole until liquid appears.
Cover dish and bake in a preheated 400 deg F oven for 45 minutes or
until liquid simmers. Reduce temperature to 250 deg F and continue to
bake, covered, for 5 to 6 hours more or until top crust is a rich
golden brown.
