Title: CHOPPED LIVER II
Categories: Poultry, Jewish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Chicken livers
1 lg Onion
2    Garlic cloves
3 tb Schmaltz (chicken fat;
-see note below)
3    Eggs, hard-boiled
Melt the schmaltz in a large frying pan.  Saute the onions and garlic
in the schmaltz until the onions are tender. Add the chicken livers
and saute until done. (Livers are done when they are no longer red or
pink on the inside.)

Chop the cooked livers and onions, along with the hard boiled eggs. I
always chop by hand, using a chopper and a wooden bowl. Regardless of
how you chop them, they should be fairly coarsely chopped. Season
with a little salt and a little more melted schmaltz if things are
dry.

NOTES:

*  Chopped liver Just like Mom used to make -- This is NOT liver
pate; it's chopped liver.  And lots of folks who claim to hate liver
love this stuff.

*  Schmaltz is rendered (melted) chicken fat.  If you want to make
your own (which I recommend), get some chicken fat (from the butcher,
or from a chicken you fix; one chicken's fat is plenty). Put the fat
in a frying pan on low heat. Stir the pieces of fat frequently; if
there's lots of fat, you can drain the pan into a container to keep
things from splattering too much. The fat will eventually melt down
to a tough, dry blob (the griveners, which are pure poison, but I
love 'em!), at which point you're done rendering. The liquid fat is
the schmaltz.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
