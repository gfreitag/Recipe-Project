Title: CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT THUMBPRINTS
Categories: Cookies
1/2 c  hazelnuts
Yield: 36 Servings
1 1/2 c  flour
1/4 c  unsweetened cocoa
1/2 ts salt
1/2 c  plus 2 tablespoons unsalted
butter -- room
temperature
:
:
7 TB sugar
1    whole egg
1    egg yolk
1/2 ts vanilla
1/3 c  raspberry preserves
1 ts powdered sugar

1.  Put the nuts in a small baking pan and toast in a preheated
350-degree oven about 7 to 10 minutes, or until the skins start to
crack. Cool slightly and put into a kitchen towel; rub together to
remove the skins. Cool completely.  Process in a food processor until
finely ground. Set aside. 2. Sift together the flour, cocoa and salt;
set aside. With an electric mixer cream together the butter and sugar
until fluffy. Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla; mix to blend. Slowly
add the flour mixture in 3 additions, beating well after each
addition. Add the nuts, mixing until well blended. 3. Roll the dough
into 1-inch balls and place on 2 ungreased baking sheets. Make an
indentation with your thumb in the center of each cookie. Spoon a
little of the raspberry preserves into the indentations. (It is
easiest to use a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon.) 4. Bake in a
preheated 350-degree oven 12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
Just before serving, sift the powdered sugar lightly over the cookies.
