Title: COCA-COLA RIBS
Categories: Barbeque, Marinades, Bbq sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lb Pork Ribs
3 c  Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper
3 c  Ketchup
1 c  Packed Dark Brown Sugar
6 tb Chili Powder
4 tb Ground black pepper
2 tb Dry mustard
1 tb Ground cinnamon
Transfer the ribs to a large non-reactive glass or ceramic dish pour
2 cups of Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper over them. Reserve the third cup of
the soda for a sauce to be made later. Let the ribs marinate, tightly
covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated, overnight.

About 6 1/2 hours before you plan to serve the ribs, start a fire in
your smoke/cooker and begin heating a quantity of coals. Then turn
your attention to the sauce.

Pour the remaining 1 cup of soda into a blender or food processor and
measure in the catsup, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, dry
mustard, and cinnamon.  Mix until smooth and well blended. No need to
cook this one, as least for now.

Add some well-soaked aromatic wood such as hickory or mesquite to the
glowing coals in your cooker.  Set a pan filled with hot water in
place, and smoke cook the ribs, covered at 220 to 240 degrees F. for
about 3 hours.

After this initial smoking, turn the ribs, slather them with the
sauce, check the supply of wood and water in their respective pans,
and continue cooking for another 3 hours, this time turning the ribs
every 30 minutes and mopping them with sauce each time they're
turned. By the end of the 3 hours, they should have long since
reached the internal temperature of 160 to 170 degrees recommended
for pork.

After the last basting of the ribs, tote the remaining sauce inside
and simmer in a medium-size saucepan over low heat until quite thick.

Serve the gloriously gooey sauce in dipping bowls with the finished
ribs.
