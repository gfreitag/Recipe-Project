Preheat oven to 325 F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with nonstick
cooking spray. Put 1 Tbs flour in bottom of pan and shake to evenly
coat it. Set aside, then prepare crust.

To make crust, mix remaining flour, oats, 1 cup sugar and salt in
large bowl; stir to mix well. In separate bowl, combine 1/4 cup egg
substitute, oil, water and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Pour the
liquid ingredi- ents into dry ingredients. Mix well to form dry
dough. Scrape the dough into previously prepared pan. Using a large
sheet of wax paper, press the dough, using your hands, across bottom
of pan and up the sides about 1/4 inch (The dough will not stick to
your fingers because of the wax paper.) Discard wax paper and bake
the crust for 15 to 17 minutes, or until firm to touch and lightly
golden.

In same large bowl, combine remaining 1 cup sugar, and cornstarch and
stir until well mixed. Pour in 3/4 cup egg substitute, lemon juice,
lime juice, lemon rind and remaining vanilla extract. Whisk mixture
until sugar is dissolved and no cornstarch lumps remain. Pour
custard- filling over the crust and bake 20 min. longer, until
filling is set. Remove from heat, allow to cool completely. Sprinkle
with confectioners sugar and cut into 32 pieces.
