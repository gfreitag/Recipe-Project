Title: CINNAMON POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes, Breakfast, British
Yield: 3 Servings
3    Potatoes, lg.
2    Onions, chopped, med.
3 tb Butter
2 tb Cinnamon
Salt
Pepper
***NOTE*** Do NOT replace the butter in this recipe for anything
else. I can tell you from my experience and experimentation that the
results are NOT the same.  It is the combination of tastes of butter,
onions and cinnamon that make this dish.  I have even tried
combinations of oleo and butter, and oil and butter with disastrous
results. The frying fat MUST be pure, 100% butter. ****** Peel and
slice potatoes. Peel and chop onions. Melt butter in a skillet. Place
potatoes and onion in skillet. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add
cinnamon (I used the quantity of 2 tb, this is merely a guesstimate,
I use a VERY generous amount). Fry on medium heat, turning
occasionally, until potatoes are tender and slightly browned. Great
served with shirred eggs or fried eggs with crisp bacon.
