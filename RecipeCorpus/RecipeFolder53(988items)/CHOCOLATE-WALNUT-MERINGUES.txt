Title: CHOCOLATE-WALNUT MERINGUES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 48 Servings
2 c  Unsifted powdered sugar
1/4 c  Cocoa powder (not a mix)
1    Jumbo egg white
1/2 c  Finely ground walnuts
- OR pecans
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 300F. Beat all the ingredients together at the
highest mixer speed for about 1 minute, or mix them in a food
processor fitted with the metal chopping blade for about 30 seconds.
The mixture will be about as thick as fondant. With a stockinette-
covered rolling pin, well-dusted with powdered sugar, roll the
mixture on a board, also liberally dusted with 10X sugar, until it is
1/4-inch thick. With a 1 1/2-inch cutter dipped in 10X sugar, cut the
meringue into small circles. Reroll the scraps and cut as many
meringues as possible. Space the meringues about 1 1/2 inches apart
on baking sheets. The baking sheets should be liberally dusted with
flour. Bake them uncovered for 15 minutes. Cool the meringues for
about 5 minutes on the baking sheets; then, with a spatula, carefully
loosen them. Transfer them to wire racks. When they are cool, store
them in airtight containers.
