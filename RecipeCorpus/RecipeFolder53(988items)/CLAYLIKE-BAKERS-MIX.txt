Mix together the flour and salt; add water while stirring. If using
glycerine, cut water slightly.  If adding liquid color also adjust
water. Knead until smooth and workable for 5 to 10 minutes.
This is very, very flexible - it can be flattened, cut, rolled,
braided, layered, squeezed through garlic press, cut with cookie
cutters, pressed into molds, pinched, coiled, or whatever you can
think of to do.
When baked, this becomes extremely hard, similar to ceramic clay.
The temperature and time depend on the thickness of design and
materials added to basic dough. Some items with bulk should be baked
in a 350~ oven for 1 hour.  cookie type flattened items need long
slow drying -- use low temp (150~) overnight -- about 8 hours.
