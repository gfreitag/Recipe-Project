Title: CHRISTMAS COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Christmas, Holiday
Yield: 2 Servings
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Melted butter
2    Eggs beaten
1 ts Vanila
2 c  Sifted flour
1 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
Blend sugar and shortening welll.  Stir in beaten eggs and vanila.
Sift and mix dry ingredients and add to butter mixture, blending
well. Chill. Turn on to lightly blouredboard and roll to 1/8 inch
thickness. Cut with floured cutters.

Before baking, I sprinkle colored sugar on to the cookies. It sticks
and then there's no need for frosting, unless you would rather have
it.

On greased cookie sheets, bake in dg.375 oven for 10 to 12 minutes.
