Title: CHOCOLATE-DIPPED STRAWMBERRIES
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pt Strawberries with stems on
-(preferably a
Long-stemmed variety),
-washed and
Patted dry
4 oz Semisweet chocolate
1 tb Cooking oil
Spread strawberries on a working surface with wax-paper-covered tray
nearby. You will also need one or two bamboo skewers or other picks.

In the top of a double boiler over hot water, melt the chocolate with
the cooking oil, stirring to mix thoroughly. (The cooking oil will
add a beautiful shine to the completed sweet.) Place melted chocolate
near working surface, but keep chocolate warm.

One at a time, insert the skewer in the stem end of a strawberry and
dip into the chocolate.  Lift out and shake any excess chocolate back
into the pot.  Place the strawberry on the wax paper and continue
with the remaining berries.  The strawberries should set for about 10
minutes before being served.

Chocolate-dipped strawberries can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours,
during which time the chocolate will harden.
