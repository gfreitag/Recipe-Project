For dough, soften yeast in lukewarm water.  (Use warm water for dry
yeast.) Pour scalded milk over sugar, salt and shortening. Cool to
lukewarm. Stir in 1 cup flour. Add softened yeast and oats. Stir in
enough more flour to make a soft dough.

Turn out on lightly floured board or canvas; knead until smooth and
satiny, about 10 minutes.  Round dough into ball; place in greased
bowl; brush lightly with melted shortening. Cover and let rise in
warm place until double in size, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down; cover; let rest 10 minutes.  Divide dough in half.
Roll one half to form a 15 x 8-inch rectangle. Brush with melted
butter; sprinkle with half of filling made by combining sugar and
cinnamon. Starting with short side, roll up as for jelly roll.

Place on greased 8-1/2" x 4-1/2" x 2-1/2" loaf pan. Brush lightly with
melted shortening.  Repeat with other half of dough. Cover; let rise
until nearly double in size, about 45 minutes.

Bake in preheated moderate oven (375 F.) 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from
pans; brush with melted butter. Cool.
