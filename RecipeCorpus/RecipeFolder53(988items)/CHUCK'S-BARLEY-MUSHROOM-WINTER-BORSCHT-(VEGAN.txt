Title: CHUCK'S BARLEY-MUSHROOM WINTER BORSCHT (VEGAN
Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Barley
1/2 c  Mixed baby lima beans, split
Peas, brown lentils
1 tb Olive oil
6 c  Water
2 tb Miso
1 lg Onion, chopped
5    To 6 turnips, peeled and
Cubed (or 2 parsnips, or 2
Potatoes)
2    Carrots, sliced about 1/2"
Thick
1/2    To 3/4 pound mushrooms,
Sliced
3    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 ts Pepper (or to taste)
2 ts Marjoram
1 ts Rosemary
1/3 c  Tamari
3 tb Unsalted butter (or magarine
For vegan)
Saute the garlic and onion in olive oil on medium heat until the
onions are translucent. Combine the barley, lima beans, split peas,
lentils, miso, and water with the onion/garlic, and bring to a boil.
Add the turnips and carrots, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer
for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

("But grandma, where did they get miso in the Ukraine?" "Shut up and
eat your soup.")

(If you have broccoli stems, peel and slice them and add them at this
point.  I also snagged about 1 cup of shredded/sliced cabbage from
the main dish, and added about 1/2 hour before the soup was done).

Add the mushrooms, spices and tamari and continue cooking on a low
heat for another hour.  Add the butter or margarine, let sit for a
few minutes, and serve.  If cooking the night before, you might want
to add 1 cup of water and heat again just before serving; the barley
tends to absorb water, and if you omit this extra water you end up
with a tasty gruel.

The butter can be omitted, but it makes for a heartier soup.
