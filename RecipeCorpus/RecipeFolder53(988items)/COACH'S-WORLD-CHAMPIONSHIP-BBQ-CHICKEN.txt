Title: COACH'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP BBQ CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Whole chickens (Tyson)
24 oz Italian salad dressing,
Wishbone
1 lb Head Country BBQ spice
3 c  Coach's BBQ Sauce
1 ga Zip lock bag
Put two whole chickens in a gallon zip lock bag with a 24 oz. bottle
of Wishbone Italian Salad Dressing. Seal the bag and refrigerate
overnight. Remove from bag and pat dry. Sprinkle the spice over the
chicken inside and out.  Place chicken in the smoker and cook for 5
hours or until done. Every hour brush on a lemon mop ( see recipe).
If you are grilling the chicken, brush on more often. At the four
hour mark brush the BBQ sauce over the chicken, repeat every 30
minutes till chicken is done. This recipe works well with chicken
halves or chicken breasts. Also you can grill the chicken pieces.
Leave the skin on while grilling so the chicken will not dry out. Put
the BBQ sauce on the last 10 to 15 minutes of grilling. Otherwise the
chicken will burn if the BBQ sauce has tomatoes or sugar in it. Also,
if you cook pieces of chicken DO NOT marinate them more then 3 to
4    hours.
