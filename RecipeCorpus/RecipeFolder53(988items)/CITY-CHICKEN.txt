City Chicken -- See below:
Cut 2 lbs lean pork and veal into pieces 1 1/2 inches long and 1/4
thick. String pieces of veal alternately with the pork, about 8 or 9
pieces on a skewer (wooden or metal). Salt the meat. Dip in flour,
beaten egg and bread crumbs.  Fry in a little bit of oil to brown.
Remove to a baking dish that has been sprayed with Pam. Cover and
cook until tender. *As kids we ate the meat right off of the wooden
skewers as though it were a chicken leg!
