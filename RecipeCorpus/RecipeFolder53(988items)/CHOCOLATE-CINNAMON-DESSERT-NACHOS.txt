2 tb Sugar; granulated - and
1/2 c  Sugar; granulated
1/2 ts Cinnamon

6    Tortillas; Flour - 8"
1 c  Cream; heavy or whipping
1/3 c  Sugar; brown - packed

Preheat oven to 350F. In small bowl, mix together 2 Tbsp granulated
sugar and cinnamon. Melt 4 Tbsp butter. Brush melted butter on both
sides of tortillas. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar on 1 side. Stack
tortillas on top of one another, sugared sides up, and cut the stack
into 10 to 12 wedges. Place tortilla wedges. Place tortilla wedges,
sugared sides up, in a single layer on buttered baking sheets. Bake
12 to 14 minutes or till tortilla wedges are crisp and golden brown.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine cream, remaining 1/2 cup
granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Heat to boiling over medium heat,
stirring often. Boil 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, till slightly
thickened. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Transfer half of
mixture to a bowl. Add chocolate and stir till melted. To remaining
mixture, stir in remaining 1 Tbsp butter. Let both sauces cool to
lukewarm. To assemble nachos, scatter tortilla pieces in single layer
over a large serving platter. Drizzle some chocolate sauce and
caramel sauce over tortilla and sprinkle about 3 Tbsp nuts on top.
Repeat layer until all ingredients are used. Serve immediately.
