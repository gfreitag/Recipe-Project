Recipe by: TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH6287 Preparation Time: Line a 12
1/2 x 4 1/2inch sharpedged loaf pan with enough foil to hang over the
sides about 3 inches.

Chop the chocolate into small pieces and melt with the butter in the
top of a double boiler or in a bowl over simmering water. Remove from
the heat and stir in the Kahlua. Whisk in the egg yolks until well
combined.

Whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gently fold the whites
into the chocolate mixture in two stages.

Pour into the prepared pan, tap on the counter to remove air, smooth
top, and cover with plastic wrap touching the top surface. Chill 6
hours or overnight.

To serve, remove the plastic wrap and invert onto a serving platter.
The chocolate should release easily. Remove the foil.

Coat dessert plates with Espresso Creme Anglaise. Top each with a
slice of chocolate. (This slices most easily with a long, thin knife
that has been dipped into hot water.)
