remove from heat. Add flour all a once; beat very hard with a wooden
spoon. over low heat, beat until very smooth-about 2 minutes. Remove
from heat; let cool slightly. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating
well after each addition. Add vanilla. Continue beating until mixture
has a satinlike sheen. Meanwhile, in a deep skillet or deep fryer,
slowly heat salad oil (at least 1-1/2 inch) to 380*F on deep fry
thermometer. Press the doughnut mixture through a large pastry bag
with a large, fluted tip, 1/2 inch wide. With wet scissors, cut
batter into 2 inch lengths as it drops into hot oil. Deep fry, a few
at a time, 2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Lift out
with slotted spoon; drain well on paper towels. Meanwhile combine
cinnamon and sugar in a medium bowl. Toss drained doughnuts in sugar
mixture to coat well. Serve warm.
