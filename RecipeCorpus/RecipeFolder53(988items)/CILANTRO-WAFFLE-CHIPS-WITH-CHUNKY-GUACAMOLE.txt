1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Cornmeal
1 1/4 tb Double-acting baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper

Preheat waffle iron. Preheat oven to 200'F. Melt butter; reserve in a
large bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking
soda, salt and pepper to mix. In another bowl, beat together
buttermilk and egg until well blended and whisk into dry ingredients.
Stir in cilantro and jalapeno. Fold in corn oil and melted butter,
mixing only until combined.

Lightly butter or spray grids of your waffle iron, if needed. Brush or
spray grids again only if subsequent waffles stick.

Spoon out 1/2 cup of batter (or amount your waffle maker's
manufacturer suggests) onto iron, spreading it evenly to edge of
grids with a metal spatula or wooden spoon. Close lid and bake until
golden and crispy. Remove waffle from iron and separate into hearts
or cut into whatever size pieces you want. Place on a baking sheet,
in a single layer, and put into preheated oven. Continue making rest
of batch and putting finished waffles on sheet in oven. The waffles
should bake in oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until they are very
crispy. Serve immediately or cool on a rack and serve at room
temperature.
