Title: CINNAMON HONEY ALE
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 5 Servings
3 1/2 lb Laaglander Amber dry malt
1 1/2 oz Cascade hops (boiling)
6 x  Inches cinnamon bark
2 1/2 lb Raw honey
1/2 oz Cascade hops (finishing)
1 pk Ale yeast (Glenbrew)
Add honey, malt, and boiling hops to 5 gallons of water. Boil for one
hour, skimming the surface every few minutes to remove the assorted
bee antennae and eyeballs from the unfiltered honey. Lightly crush
the cinnamon bark and add during the final 10 minutes of the boil.
Add the finishing hops 3 minutes from the end of the boil. Sparge,
cool, and siphon into primary, topping off to 5 gallons with
pre-boiled water. Pitch yeast, ferment, prime with 3/4 cup of dry
malt boiled in 1 1/2 cups water, and bottle. Allow beer to age at
least a month before drinking. As is typical with honey-based brews,
this beer gets better and better with age.
