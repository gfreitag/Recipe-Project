Title: CLASSIC MEATLOAF
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
8 oz Tomato sauce
1 c  Soft bread crumbs
1 sm Onion; finely chopped
1    Egg; slightly beaten
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Dried thyme leaves
1/2 ts Garlic salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 tb Packed brown sugar
1 ts Dry mustard
By shaping the ground beef mixture into small, two-serving loaves,
baking time can be reduced by 30 minutes. Gentle handling when mixing
the ground beef with the other ingredients will ensure a moist,
tender meatloaf.

Preparation and cooking time: 1 hr.

1. Heat oven to 350 F. Reserve 1/4 cup tomato sauce. In large bowl,
combine ground beef, remaining tomato sauce, bread crumbs, onion, egg,
Worcestershire sauce, thyme, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly
but thoroughly.

2. Divide mixture into thirds and shape to form three loaves, each
about 1-1/2 inches thick; place on rack in open roasting pan. Combine
reserved tomato sauce, brown sugar and mustard; spread over top of
loaves.

3. Bake in 350 F oven 40 to 45 minutes or until no longer pink and
juices run clear. To serve cut each meatloaf into 1-inch thick slices.

Cook's tip: To make soft bread crumbs, place torn bread slices in food
processor, fitted with steel blade, or blender container. Cover;
process 30 seconds, pulsing on and off, until fine crumbs. One and a
half slices will yield 1 cup soft bread crumbs.
