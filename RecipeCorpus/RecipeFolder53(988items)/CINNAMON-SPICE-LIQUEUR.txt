In a glass bottle or jar, steep the cinnamon stick, minced ginger,
cloves and nutmeg in the vodka and brandy for about 2 weeks in a
dark, cool place, gently shaking the bottle each day.

Gently pour the jar's contents through a regular strainer or sieve,
pressing hard on the solids to release all their flavor. Follow this
with 2 strainings through slightly damp cheesecloth. For true clarity
and professional - looking results, pour the strained mixture through
a large clean coffee filter placed inside a funnel or clean coffee
cone; loosely cover the contents with plastic wrap, since the process
may take several hours.

In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil over
moderately high heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Let cool to
room temperature.

Funnel the strained spice mixture into a glass bottle, then funnel in
the sugar syrup. Cork tightly; shake to blend. Let mature at room
temperature or slightly cooler for at least 1 week. Makes about 1
pint.

Note: The prep time does not include the 3 weeks necessary for the
liqueur to steep and mature.

Sodium NOTES : The author's favorite way to serve this zesty liqueur
is mixed into whipped cream for gingerbread topping or added to a mug
of steaming tea.
