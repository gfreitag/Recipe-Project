and ginger, stir for about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, potatoes,
carrots, and chopped cilantro, stir often until carrots are tender to
bite, about 7 minutes. Add flour and stir for 3 minutes. Remove from
heat, let cool slightly, and mix in eggs and bread crumbs. Add salt
and pepper to taste. On plastic wrap, shape vegetable mixture into 4
patties, each 1/3 inch thick. Swirl 1 teaspoon oil in a clean 10 to
12 inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Place patties in pan, 2
at a time, and cook until deep golden on bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.
Turn, add remaining oil if needed, and brown other side. Spread buns
with chutney and serve burgers with lettuce, tomato, onion, and
cilantro sprigs. Per burger with chutney, without buns: 348 cal (28%
