Preheat the oven to 325=B0F.

Place cherries and wine in a small bowl and allow to plump for at

With a mixer, beat the eggs and sugar together until fluffy and light
yellow. In a separate small sauce pan melt the butter, chocolate and
cocoa together, add vanilla. Fold into the egg mixture. Drain the
cherries and stir in.

Mix the baking powder and flour together and beat in until the dough
pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is just slightly tacky.
With floured hands, roll into 2 15-inch logs, 1 1/2 inches in
diameter. Bake on parchment paper in a preheated oven for 20-25
minutes or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Remove from
oven and cool until logs can be cut on the diagonal into 1/4 inch
widths. Place biscotti in a single layer on baking sheet and return
to oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes.

Store airtight for up to 1 month.

Yield: Approximately 36 biscotti
