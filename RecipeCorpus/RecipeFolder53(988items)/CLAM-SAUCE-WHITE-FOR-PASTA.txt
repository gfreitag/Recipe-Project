Title: CLAM SAUCE WHITE FOR PASTA
Categories: Pasta, Fish, Sauces
Yield: 2 -4
24    Littleneck clams, small
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2    Cloves garlic, minced
Fresh Ital. parsley, minced
2 tb Creme fraiche
Olive oil
1 tb Flour
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  Water
Fresh chervil, minced
1 ds Louisiana hot sauce
1/2 lb Spaghetti or linguine
Freshly ground black pepper
3    Heated pasta plates/bowls
Soak clams in cold fresh water. Put a large pot of water on to boil
for the pasta. Put the bay leaf, the wine, and the water in a large
covered non-reactive skillet and bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 min.
Return to med-high heat and add clams. Cover. Cook until you start to
hear clams popping open - about 5 min. Begin checking on clams every
30 seconds and remove clams to heated covered bowl as they open,
replacing covers each time. If any clams have not opened after 10
minutes total cooking, discard them. When clams are done, pour all
accumulated broth into a pitcher and set aside. Put pasta in boiling
water to begin cooking and set timer so that pasta will be slightly
undercooked. Return skillet to moderate heat and add olive oil,
garlic, flour, and half the minced herbs. Cook 2 - 5 minutes, but
***do not let the garlic even begin to brown***. Add about a cup of
the clam broth. Stir with a whisk. Broth should thicken slightly into
a thin sauce. Reduce or add more broth as necessary. Whisk in the
creme fraiche and the hot sauce and bring just back to a simmer, then
remove from heat. Toss with cooked pasta. Put pasta on heated bowls
and surround with clams. Sprinkle generously with freshly-ground
pepper and the other half of the herbs.
