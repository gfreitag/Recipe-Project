a lighlty floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Transfer dough into oiled bowl, turning to coat all sides.

until doubled, about an hour. Grease two large baking sheets. Punch
down dough. Turn onto lightly floured surface and roll out into a 12
x 18 rectangle. Spread with butter. Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar,
nuts, raisins and cinnamon. Starting with a long side, roll up jelly
roll style. Cut into slices slightly over 1 inch thick. Arrange on
prepared baking sheets, tucking ends of dough under. Let stand in a
warm draft free area until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.

minutes. Prepare icing while rolls are baking...Combine all
ingredients in a small bowl and beat until smooth, using only enough
orange juice to thin for spreading or drizzling...Spread or drizzle
while rolls are still hot. Serve warm or at room temperature Makes 16
