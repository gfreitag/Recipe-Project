Crust: Add all ingredients into food processor. Blend well. Put in 10"
springform pan. Press evenly on bottom and 1/2 up the sides.

Filling: Beat cream cheese in large mixing bowl with electric mixer on
medium speed until smooth and fluffy, stopping to scrape down sides
of bowl occasionally. Gradually add sugar, flour, lemon peel, salt
and vanilla, beating constantly. Add eggs and yolks one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Scrape down sides once or twice.
Mix in sour cream; the mixture will be thin. Pour into crust lined
pan.

Place on baking sheet. Bake at 500 degree oven for 8 minutes or until
top is golden. Reduce temperature to 200 degrees and continue to bake
for 1 hour or until center jiggles slightly. Remove to wire rack and
cool in draft-free place at room temperature for 3 hours or overnight.

Remove sides of springform. Make desired glaze and spread evenly over
top of cheescake as directed. Refrigerate until serving.

Strawberry Glaze: Slice 1 cup of the berries and place in a medium
sized saucepan with the water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat and
cook for 2 minutes. Push berries with spoon through a strainer placed
over small bowl; scrape bottom of strainer to remove all pulp. Return
berries to saucepan and stir sugar and cornstarch. Bring to a boil
over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens. Stir
in food coloring. Cool to lukewarm.

Slice remaining berries in half and arrange in concentric circles
over top of cake. Spoon warm glaze over berries, letting some of the
glaze drip down the sides of the cake. Refrigerate until set, about 1
hour. Submitted By PGL@IGLOU.COM (DON THOMAS)  On   27 FEB 1995
