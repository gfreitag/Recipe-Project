Title: CLYDE'S MEATLOAF
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2 c  Old-fashioned oatmeal
1/2 c  + 2 T honey
1/2 c  Milk
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
Salt and fresh pepper
2 1/2 lb Ground chuck
3/4 c  Grated carrots
1/3 c  Ketchup
1 ts Dry mustard
1. Combine the oatmeal, honey and milk in a large mixing bowl. Allow
to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F.

2. Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat and add the onion and
garlic. Add salt and pepper to taste, and saute until the onion is
translucent and softened slightly.

3. Add the onion to the oatmeal mixture, along with the meat, add
salt to taste, and plenty of black pepper. Add the grated carrots,
mix thoroughly, and place in a non-stick 9 x 5 x 3 loaf pan. (If
using a regular loaf pan, oil it lightly.) Place the loaf pan on a
cookie sheet to catch any spills and put in oven. (Typist's note: I
used a bundt pan and it works much better -- no boil over of grease).

4. Bake the meatloaf for 50 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully
tip the pan to drain off the excess fat and liquid, and then turn the
meatloaf out onto the cookie sheet. Turn right side up. Combine the
ketchup and mustard and spread the mixture over the top of the
meatloaf. Return meatloaf to the oven and bake for an additional 20
minutes.
