In a large bowl, beat the ricotta cheese, heavy cream, rum, chocolate
flavoring, cocoa, and sugar until very smooth and creamy. Pour the
mixture into a well-buttered springform pan and bake in a preheated
400-degree oven for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to
325-degrees and continue to bake for another hour, or until golden
brown. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool completely. When
completely cooled, remove the sides of the springform pan and
decorate the top of the cake with the powdered sugar. Either
refrigerate or serve immediately. From: Dottie Cross Reformatted for
