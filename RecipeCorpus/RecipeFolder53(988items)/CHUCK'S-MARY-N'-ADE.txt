Title: CHUCK'S MARY N' ADE
Categories: Sauces, Rubs
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lb Chuck roast
1 c  Red Wine
60 ml Garlic -- Sliced
1 ea Sliced Onion
1 ts Thyme
1 tb Cayene Pepper
1 tb Paprika
1 ts Basil
Combine all ingredients and let marinade for at least 4 hours but not
longer than 12. If you are smoking the meat, 4 hours is enough but
smoke with the wood you prefer for at least 2 hr/lb. If you want to
grill the meat, marinate for the 12 hr. and quickly sear on a very
hot grill for 15 min. Turn once for another 15 mins and let stand for
15 min before slicing. Of course, your hot is different than my hot.
While the meat is resting, grill the onions on Al foil.
