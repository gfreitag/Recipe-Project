Title: CINNAMON-APPLE LOLLIPOPS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 20 Each
1 ts Vegetable oil
10 lg Cinnamon sticks, 2" to
2 1/2" long
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
1 ts Cinnamon oil
2 tb Apple-juice concentrate
Brush vegetable oil evenly over a baking sheet.  With a large chef's
knife, cut each cinnamon stick in half lengthwise along the groove
between the two curled edges. Arrange the cinnamon sticks on the
prepared baking sheet and set aside.  In a heavy medium saucepan,
combine sugar, corn syrup, cinnamon oil and 1/2 c water; bring to a
boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
Clip a candy thermometer to the pan and boil until the temperature
reaches 300 degrees and is at hard-crack stage (when a bit of syrup
dropped into ice water is hard and brittle and does not stick to
teeth).  This will take about ten minutes. Remove from the heat and
stir in apple-juice concentrate.  Return saucepan to high heat and
cook, stirring, until thoroughly combined. Continue cooking, swirling
the pan just until the mixture begins to color, 1 to 3 minutes.
Immediately remove from heat and let stand until the bubbles subside,
about 2 minutes. Spoon about 1/2 T of the hot sugar mixture over the
tip of each cinnamon stick and let stand until hardened, about 5
minutes.  (If the sugar mixture hardens before all lollipops are
formed, return the pan to high heat just until the syrup begins to
bubble; be careful not to let it burn. Let stand for 1 to 2 minutes,
then continue.) When lollipops have set, carefully loosen them from
the baking sheet. (The lollipops can be stored in an airtight
container, with was paper between each layer, in a cool, dry place
for up to 1 week.)  28 calories per lollipop: 0 g protein, 1 g fat, 6
