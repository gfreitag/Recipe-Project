Categories: Breads, Holiday, Snacks, Desserts, Breakfast
Yield: 6 Servings
2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Butter or margarine
1 1/4 c  Sugar, divided
3    Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Dairy sour cream
2 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour, balking powder, and
salt in a small bowl until well blended. In a large bowl, beat butter
and 1 cup of the sugar until creamy and light. Beat in eggs, one at a
time and vanilla until well blended. Beat in flour mixture and sour
cream, alternately, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. In
a small bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the cinnamon. Spoon
about one third of the batter into greased and floured 9 x 5-inch
loaf pan. Sprinkle with one third of the cinnamon mixture. Repeat
with remaining batter and cinnamon mixture until all is used up.
Sprinkle the top of the bread with pecans, pressing them in slightly
with your fingers. Bake 50 to 55 minutes, or until a wooden pick
inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool bread 10 minutes in the
pan on a wire rack. Remove from pan and cool completely on rack.
