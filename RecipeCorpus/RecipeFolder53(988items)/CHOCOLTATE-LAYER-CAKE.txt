HELLO FELLOW PASSOVER CHEFS!!! Every year my mother-in-law has a large
first seder (35 people) and every year we have the same food!!! I have
offered to bring a new carrot dish, does any one have a simple tasty
dish to serve with the main course? Below is a wonderful chocolate
layer cake recipe that is easy and fun for kids to help make: DIP ONE
SHEET OF MATZAH IN THE WINE AND PLACE ON A PLATTER, SPREAD WITH
FROSTING, CONTINUE DIPPING AND LAYERING UNTIL YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH
THE HEIGHT OF YOUR CAKE AND FROST THE OUTSIDE AND DECORATE WITH FRUIT
OR NUTS OR CHOCOLATE. REFRIGERATE OVER NIGHT SO THE MATZAH HAS TIME
TO SOFTEN. REGARDING THE FROSTING, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN >> KOSHER
FOR PASSOVER VERSION OR YOU CAN USE THE STORE BOUGHT KIND IF YOU ARE
NOT TOO OBSERVANT. I PERSONALLY AGREE WITH SANDI BROOKS, I FOLLOW
PASSOVER TRADITION BUT NOT THE STRICT LAW. LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR
CARROT RECIPES, Reformatted by Elaine Radis
