Categories: Condiments
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Fresh coconut*
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 lb Granny Smith apples
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/2 lg Bunch cilantro, stemmed
2    Serrano or jalapeno chilies,
-seeded, stemmed, halved
2    Garlic cloves, each cut in

3/4 ts Salt
*Buy a heavy coconut that has no cracks and that sounds full of
liquid when shaken.

Preheat oven to 375 F.

After draining liquid from coconut, bake until shell begins to crack,
about 30 minutes. Tap coconut shell with hammer to remove shell. (The
white meat with its brown skin should fall away from shell; if it
doesn't, use paring knife to release meat.) Using paring knife, cut
away brown skin from coconut, if desired. Rinse coconut. Coarsely
chop in processor to measure 3/4 cup (reserve remaining coconut for
another use).

Heat small skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds; stir until
fragrant, about 3 minutes (do not burn). Transfer seeds to plate;
cool. Finely grind seeds in spice grinder or in mortar with pestle.

Core apples; cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Place apples in medium bowl.
Add lemon juice and toss to coat. Combine 3/4 cup coconut, cumin,
apples and all remaining ingredients in processor. Chop finely.

(Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
temperature before using.)
