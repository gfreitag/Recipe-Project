Title: COATING FOR YOUR THANKSGIVING TURKEY
Categories: Chicken, Condiments, Poultry, Holiday
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 c  Paprika
Salt
Garlic powder
Onion; dried
Pepper
Water; to make paste
This will do about a 13-15lb turkey.  Other seasonings are to taste. I
never did measure. This is a coating you can put on all poultry before
roasting.  Basically you make a paste of the above ingredients. It
should be the consistencey of finger paint--thick and not runny. If
you have kids, put them in old clothes and let them help. I smear it
in and out of the cavity. Notice that this does not have any Gravy
Master or oil...both unneeeded in my opinion. The skin cooks nice and
crisp. Remember to baste during cooking. BTW, use this in the Nuke
too.
Sometimes we do a turkey or chicken in there when we have lot's of
other baking/roasting to do.  When Howard was in training to be a
Chef, he brought home a bunch of fellow students for dinner. Not one
of them even came close to guessing that the turkey had been made in
the nuke. I hope all of you have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.
