Title: CHOPPED LIVER (SULSUM SINE SULSO)
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Chicken livers
3/4 c  Olive oil
Salt and pepper
1) Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a frying pan and gently saute
the chicken livers for 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked
through.

2) Remove the cooked livers, place in a mixing bowl, and mash well
with a fork (or use a blender). Add another 1/4 cup of the oil, salt
and pepper to taste, and mix well with the liver.

3) Place the chopped liver in a serving dish and shape it into the
likeness of a fish.  Pour the remaining 1/4 cup oil on top of the
fish. Serve. NOTE: Liquamen (recipe posted earlier) may be used in
addition to or in place of the salt. Apicius' recipe calls for a fish
mold; if you have a fish-shaped gelatin mold, you could not be more
authentic. If it is a large one, however, you may have to double the
recipe.
