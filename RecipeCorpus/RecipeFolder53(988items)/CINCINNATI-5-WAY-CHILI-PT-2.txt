Title: CINCINNATI 5-WAY CHILI PT 2: CONSTRUCTION
Categories: Beef, Main dish, Tex-mex, Pasta, Chili
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------PART TWO-------------------------------
8 oz Thick spaghetti
16 oz Can red kidney beans
2 x  Onions, chpd
1 lb Wisconsin cheddar,fine grate
The bottom layer is always spaghetti, the thickest you can find. If
you have trouble, try using long, thin macaroni like perciatelli.
Break into 4" pieces, boil in salted water to which oil has been
added. For a touch o swank, melt a stick of sweet butter into the
just-cooked noodles before you dish them out. You will need about
2-3oz per serving. You want them soft enough to cut easily with a
fork, but not so soft they lose their oomph. Remember, they are the
support layer for four other ingredients. Spread them out to cover
the bottom of a small oval plate. Ladle on the chili, enough to cover
the noodles. Wash kidney beans and heat with 2c water, then drain.
Spoon a sparce layer atop the chili. Spread onions over beans.
Quickly (so it melts) spread cheese to cover everything. Don't skimp.
Cheese should completely blanket the plate, enough so that you can
pat it into a neat mound with your hands, just the way they do in
Cincinnati. Variations: 3-Way or 4-Way: Omit either beans or onions,
or both.
