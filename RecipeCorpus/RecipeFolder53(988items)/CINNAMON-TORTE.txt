Title: CINNAMON TORTE
Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
4 oz Self-raising flour
1 ts Powdered cinnamon
4 oz Ground almonds
4 oz Caster sugar
4 oz Butter or margarine
1    Lemon; (grated rind only)
8 oz Raspberry jam
Icing sugar
Sift the flour and cinnamon into a bowl or food processor, then put
in the ground almonds, sugar, butter or margarine and grated lemon
rind. Process, without the plunger (to let in more air and make the
mixture light), or rub the fat into the other ingredients with your
fingers. Either way, the result will be a soft dough. You can roll
this out straight away, but it's easier to handle if you wrap it in
polythene and chill it for 30 minutes.

Set the oven to 180 C/350 F/Gas Mark 4.  On a lightly floured board,
roll out two-thirds of the almond mixture, to fit a 20 cm/8 inch flan
tin. Put the pastry into the tin and trim the edges. Spread the jam
over the pastry, then roll out the remaining pastry, including the
trimmings, and cut long strips to make a lattice across the top of
the jam. Bake the torte for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is set
and lightly browned. Serve hot or cold, with a snowy topping of
sifted icing sugar.
