Peel orange and remove all white pith and seeds from the flesh. In a
blender or processor, puree pulp and juice until almost smooth.
Measure 1/2 c of the pulp and juice and set aside. Discard the
remaining pulp.

Measure the dry ingred. and then place in pan. Add the pulp and juice,
water and oil, honey and yeast.  Place in the bread pan... (add
ingred. according to your mfg. instructions... I have to add the
yeast FIRST)

Program the machine for the WHOLE WHEAT MODE (I use WHITE BREAD CYCLE
in the ABM100-Welbilt).
