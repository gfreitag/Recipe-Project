This is from Electric Bread.  I'm putting the ingreds for what they
call a "regular loaf" because the "large loaf" could've been used for
special effects for a volcanic eruption. My sister and I are drooling
over the idea of serving this with chili at a football party this
fall. Would also be great cut into triangles (which is how I cut my
bread when I don't want to plop a big square slice >>> down for
somebody); toasted, then run under the broiler with cheddar cheese on
it. YUMMM. Make sure to drain chilies and peppers well; don't get
juice in eyes; I didn't bother to chop since they were decimated by
the kneading anyway... Adios! 07/16 04:58 pm EDT
