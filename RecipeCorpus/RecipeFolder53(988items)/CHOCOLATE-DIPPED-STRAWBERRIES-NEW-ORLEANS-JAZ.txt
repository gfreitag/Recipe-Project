Title: CHOCOLATE-DIPPED STRAWBERRIES-NEW ORLEANS JAZ
Categories: Candies, Dips, Fruit
Yield: 10 Servings
Fresh Louisiana strawberries
Candymaker's chocolate
(milk, dark, or white);
Look for chocolate labelled
As "couverture" chocolate
Wash the strawberries well, but do not remove stems. Spread the
berries on towels or absorbent paper in a single layer, and allow to
air dry until all water has evaporated (chocolate will not adhere
properly if the berries are damp). Melt 1/2 pound chocolate in a
double boiler deep enough to cover strawberries. Holding the berries
by the stem, hand dip each one 3/4 of the way up to the top. Place on
waxed paper and allow to harden or refrigerate until hard. Keep
refrigerated until ready to serve. Walt MM
