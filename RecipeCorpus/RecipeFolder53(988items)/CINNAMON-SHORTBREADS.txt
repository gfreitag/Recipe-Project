Title: CINNAMON SHORTBREADS
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 24 Pieces
100 g  Plain wholewheat flour
100 g  Plain white flour
50 g  Cornflour
50 g  Semolina or ground rice
2 ts Cinnamon (or more)
225 g  Soft butter or margarine
100 g  Caster sugar
Set the oven to 170 C (325 F, Gas Mark 3) and grease a 19 cm x 29 cm
(7-1/2 inch x 11-1/2 inch) shallow tin with butter.

Sift the flours, semolina or ground rice and cinnamon into a large
bowl or food processor, adding the residue of bran from the sieve.
Then put in the butter or margarine and the sugar. Whizz, or beat,
all the ingredients together until they form a soft dough which
leaves the sides of the bowl clean.

Press this into the tin, leveling the surface by pressing with the
back of a metal spoon.  Then prick the surface all over with a fork.
Bake for about 45 minutes, until the shortbread is set and quite
crispy on top and very lightly tinged with gold.  It's more tricky to
tell when these are done than with normal shortbreads because they
are already rather brown! If you are in doubt, you can lift up one of
the end pieces and look underneath it to see if it looks done
underneath. If not, carefully put it back and let the shortbread cook
for a bit longer. When it's done, cut it into sections, if you
haven't already done so, and leave it to cool and crisp up in the tin.

This shortbread keeps well in a tin for several days, if it gets the
chance, and also freezes well.  It defrosts very quickly; you can use
it almost straight from the freezer.
