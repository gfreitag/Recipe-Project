Bake covered 30 minutes at 35OÃ¸. Uncover for last 5 minutes. This is
based on my grandmother's recipe and was originally made with
oysters. She lived in Iowa and in those days (20s & 30s); oysters
came in on the trains once a year at Christmas time. Unfortunately,
living in Toronto, we don't get oysters on the trains! Serves:4
