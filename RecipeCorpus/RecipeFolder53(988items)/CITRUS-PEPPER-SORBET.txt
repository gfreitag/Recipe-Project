1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
3 tb Light corn syrup

Sorbets can be served either as a dessert or as a refresher between
courses. Peppers add just a little heat to the frozen fruit juices.
If your ice-cream freezer holds less than 6 cups, make this in
batches or halve the recipe.

At once cold and hot, Citrus-Pepper Sorbet has fruity flavor with a
bite.

Combine 1 1/4 cups water with sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a
boil, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and
cool to room temperature. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Meanwhile, chop the fruit, discarding any seeds. (You should have
about 3 1/2 cups.) In a blender or food processor, Puree oranges and
remaining ingredients. Add 1/2 cup water, blend briefly and strain
through a sieve. Refrigerate until needed.

Stir the sugar mixture into the fruit mixture. Pour the mixture into
an ice cream freezer and freeze according to the manufacturer's
directions. (Alternatively, transfer the mixture to a shallow pan and
freeze until almost solid. Break into large chunks and whirl the
mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth. Transfer to a
chilled airtight container and return to the freezer for 30 minutes
to 1 hour, or until firm.)
