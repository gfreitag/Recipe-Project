Oranges; halved; pulp
Removed
Brown sugar
Cinnamon sticks
Whole nutmeg
2    Whole clove
Tissue paper
<<<OR>>>
Colored plastic wrap
Cut oranges in half and remove the pulp as best you can. Dry the
oranges in a 250 degree oven for abut 2 hours on warm. Allow to cool
thoroughly. Mound brown sugar into the empty half shell. Use cinnamon
sticks for legs along the sides (6 to 8 depending on the size of the
orange). Just push into the sugar.

A whole nutmeg is pushed into the sugar as the head with 2 whole
cloves for eyes.

Wrap in tissue paper or colored plastic wrap with instruction to just
drop into two quarts of cider and heat through. My neighbors love
these and ask for them year after year.
