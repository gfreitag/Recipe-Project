Title: CINNAMON TWISTS
Categories: New text im, Cooking rig
Yield: 24 Servings    1 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 c  (2 Sticks) Unsalted Butter,
cut into bits
:
1/2 c  Sour Cream
1/2 c  Almonds -- finely chopped
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 TB Ground Cinnamon

In a food processor, combine the flour and butter. Pulse 2 or 3 times
until the mixture resembles very coarse cornmeal. Add the sour cream
and pulse brefly until the dough just begins to come together. Do not
over mix. Form into a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 4
hours or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with aluminum
foil or parchment. In a medium bowl, combine the almonds, sugar, and
cinnamon. Sprinkle the almond-sugar mixture over a work surface,
place the disk of dough on top, and roll out into a 9-by-12-inch
rectangle approximately 1/8-inch thick, encrusting the underside of
the dough with the almond-sugar mixture. Trim the edges and cut into
even strips, 9 inches long by 1/2- inch wide.

Gently pick up the ends of the strips and twist 2 or 3 times to form a
corkscrew shape and place on the baking sheet. Bake the twists for
approximately 15 minutes or until they're brown and crisp. Remove to
a rack and allow to cool. The twists should be stored in an airtight
container even for a few hours and are best eaten the same day they
are baked.

Yield: approximately 24 twists
