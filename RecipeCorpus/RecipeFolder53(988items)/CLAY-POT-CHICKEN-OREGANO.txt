Title: CLAY POT CHICKEN OREGANO
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lb Chicken
4    Whole garlic bulbs --
Unpeeled
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 c  White wine
2 tb Oregano
1 tb Salt
1 ts Pepper
1 tb Garlic -- minced
Bay leaves -- for garnish
Oil -- for drizzling
1.  Rinse clay pot with warm water and then soak in warm water for
about 15 to 20 minutes.

2.  Wash chicken thoroughly under cold water and remove giblets &
neck and refrigerate for another purpose if desired.  Reserve chicken
on a clean platter.

3.  Take a large ziplock bag-large enough to fit the entire
chicken-and marinade ingredients in the bag.  Put chicken in the bag
with marinade and refrigerate for 2 hours or more.  Every hour remove
bag from refrigerator

and make sure all parts of bird are covered with marinade in the bag.

4.  After chicken has marinated 2 hours or more, put whole bird in
clay pot with breast side up.  Wash garlic gently to remove any dirt
and cut the very top portion of each bulb off with kitchen shears.
Arrange rinsed whole garlic around bird and a few bay leaves if
desired. Drizzle each garlic bulb with up to 1 tablespoon of oil and
gently close lid of clay cooker.

5.  Gently put clay cooker in cold oven and turn temperature on to
450. Roast bird for 1 hour and 25 minutes.  A 4 pound bird will come
out roasted to perfection at that cooking time.
