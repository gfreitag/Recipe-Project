In a wok over medium-high heat, heat rice wine or mirin until
bubbling. Add ginger, garlic, carrots and broccoli. Stir-fry until
carrots soften slightly, about five minutes. Add cabbage and green
onions; cover and cook three minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove
vegetables to a platter and set aside. Add water, sesame oil, up to 1
tsp. cayenne, honey and hoisin sauce, if desired, to wok and heat
until bubbling. Add noodles and stir-fry until heated through. Add
vegetables and heat through. Add soy sauce to taste. Note: The sesame
oil gives this dish a great flavor, but leave it out if you can't
afford the few grams of fat it contributes.
