3. Mix sugar, vinegar, soya sauce, wine together in a small bowl.
Reserve.

4. Heat oil in wok until smoking, add dredged chicken, stir fry on all
sides. If oil is hot enough for chicken, pieces will not stick to wok.

5. Add sugar and vinegar reserve, hot peppers. Place cover over wok.
Add 1/2 cup water, cook over medium heat 5 minutes. Self gravy should
form in the bottom of wok. Stir chicken in gravy so it will cook in
gravy. Gravy should become gelatinous after 5 minutes of cooking. If
it becomes too thick, thin gravy out with small amounts of water.

6. Sprinle in 1 cup of peanuts, mix thoroughly.

NOTE: Canned hot peppers are too soft to be used for this dish. If
desired, dried cayenne peppers can be reconstituted for use. If you
are fond of this dish, it is well to freeze your own hot peppers, in
season.
