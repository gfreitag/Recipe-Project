Title: HOT PASTA PRIMAVERA * *(PSTT79C)
Categories: Main dish, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 x  Heavy cream,
1 x  Butter,
1 x  Reggiano Parmesan; grated
1 x  Salt black pepper to taste.
Mix all the ingredients together in a saucepan until melted and
smooth. Taste, adjust seasonings pour over hot angel hair or linguine
that has been tossed with steamed-----> vegetables (sliced carrots,
broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, yellow squash (seeds removed), snap
peas, snow peas, red bell pepper--you name the vegetable--you can put
it in there) For special effect, I cut each slice of carrot and
zucchini into flower shapes. It makes a stunning presentation. I
serve this as an appetizer in a large scallop shell.
