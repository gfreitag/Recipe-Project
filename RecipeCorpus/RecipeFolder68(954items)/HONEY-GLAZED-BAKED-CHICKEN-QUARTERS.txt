Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/3 c  Flour
1 ts Garlic salt
1 ds Fresh ground pepper
3 1/2 lb Chicken (1 whole) --
Quartered
6 tb Butter
1/4 c  Honey
3 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Soy sauce
1    Dsah

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix flour, garlic salt, and pepper,
then coat chicken quarters thoroughly. Put 2 tablespoons of the
butter in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold the chicken
in a single layer; put dish in oven to melt butter while oven
preheats. Arrange chicken, skin side down, in melted butter. Bake,
uncovered, 30 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter with honey, lemon
juice, soy sauce, and ginger. After 30 minutes remove chicken from
oven, turn skin side up, and cover with butter mixture. Continue
baking, brushing occasionally with butter-honey sauce, until chicken
is tender and richly browned (30 to 40 minutes more). Serve
immediately.
