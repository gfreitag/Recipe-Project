Title: HOT PRETZELS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Pretzels
1 c  Water (105-115 degrees F)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2 tb Soft butter
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
1 1/4 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
4 c  Water
5 ts Baking soda
Coarse salt (i.e. kosher)
Combine water and yeast. Add 1 1/2 cup flour, butter, salt, and sugar
and beat at least 3 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/4 cup flour and knead
until dough is not sticky. Let rise in greased bowl until double.
Punch down and divide into twelve pieces. Roll pieces into 18 inch
long sticks with tapered ends. Loop into pretzel shape (helps to have
a commercial pretzel handy if you can't remember what they look
like). Place on greased baking sheet and let rise again until
doubled. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.

Boil 4 cup water and 5 tsp baking soda (do not use aluminum pan) and
lower each pretzel into the water with slotted spoon. Let stay in
water about a minute or until they float. Return to greased cookie
sheet and sprinkle with coarse salt.

Bake until crispy and brown, about 12 minutes. Best eaten immediately
but can be cooled and stored about a week.

This looks like the recipe in Joy of Cooking, so I will give credit
where credit is due!
