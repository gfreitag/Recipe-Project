Original title: Chocolat.

A generous ounce (40 grams) of good sweet chocolate is needed for a
breakfast cup.  Put the chocolate broken up into pieces with a small
quantity of water or hot milk in a casserole on a gentle heat. Cover
the pan, let the chocolate soften, remove from the fire and whip into
a smooth paste with a whip or wooden spoon; add first of all two or
three tablespoons of boiling liquid (water or milk) to dilute the
paste, then the rest of the liquid, still boiling, continuing to stir
all the time. To retain the full aroma of the chocolate (the same
applies to cocoa) it must never be allowed to boil.

Gabi's notes: (1) Excellent with Mexican chocolate, such as Ibarra.
(2) I got good results using cold milk, added gradually to the hot
mixture until fully incorporated, then heated to warm (don't allow it
to boil). I use a wooden hand whisk.
