Title: HOMESTYLE CORNED BEEF & CABBAGE
Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Water
1/4 c  Honey
2 tb Dijon mustard -- divided
1 md Cabbage head -- cut into 8
Wedges
3 tb Butter or margarine --
Softened
1 1/2 ts Fresh dill -- chopped OR
1/2 ts Dried dill weed
2 1/2 lb Corned beef brisket
Place brisket and water in Dutch oven;  cover tightly and cook 1 hour
at 350  degrees (F).  (  It is very important to simmer the meat
slowly because boiling will cause meat to become tough.) Turn brisket
over and continue cooking,  covered,  1  1/2  to  2 hours, or until
meat is tender. Remove brisket  from cooking liquid and place,
flat-side up, on rack in broiler  pan  so surface of meat is 3 to 4
inches from heat. Combine honey with 1 tablespoon mustard;  brush
half of mixture over top of brisket and broil 3 minutes. Brush with
remaining mixture and continue broiling 2 minutes,  or until  brisket
is glazed. Meanwhile, steam cabbage 15 to 20 minutes,  or until
tender. Combine remaining mustard with butter and dill; spread over
hot cabbage wedges.  Carve brisket diagonally across the grain into
thin slices and serve with cabbage.
