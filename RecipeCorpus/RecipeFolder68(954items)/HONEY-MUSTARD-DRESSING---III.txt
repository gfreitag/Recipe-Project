Title: HONEY-MUSTARD DRESSING - III
Categories: Dressing, Salad
Yield: 12 Servings
3 tb Cider vinegar
3 tb Honey
6 tb Mayonnaise
1 tb Dijon mustard
1 tb Onion; finely minced
2 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
Pinch of salt
3/4 c  Vegetable oil;olive & peanut
Heat vinegar and honey in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring
until honey dissolves (or use microwave). Pour into bowl and cool.
Whisk in mayonnaise, mustard, onion, parsley and salt. Gradually
whisk in oil. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.
Bring to room temperature before using.)

NOTE: I usually make 2/3 batch.  Needs more salt than indicated above
~ about 1/4 tsp for the 2/3 batch. Best to consider parsley for the
full batch to be about 1 1/2 tbs instead of the 2 indicated above.
This is nice with a spinach/mushroom salad.

Makes about 1 1/2 cups
