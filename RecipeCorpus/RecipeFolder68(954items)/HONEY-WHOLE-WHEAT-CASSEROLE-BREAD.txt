Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
Jim Vorheis
1 c  Milk
3/4 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Honey
2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Warm water
2 pk Dry yeast
3    Eggs, slightly beaten
4 1/2 c  Unsifted flour
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 ts Soft butter
In a small saucepan, heat milk until bubbles form around edge of pan.
Remove from heat.  Add shortening, honey and salt, stirring until
shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast over water in
large bowl and stir until yeast is dissolved.  Stir in milk mixture
and eggs. Combine flours.  Add 4 cups flour mixture to yeast mixture.
With electric mixer at low speed beat until blended. Beat at medium
speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. With wooden spoon gradually beat
in remaining flour mixture. Then beat, stretching dough 20 to 30
times. Cover with waxed paper and a moist towel. Let rise in warm
place, free from drafts, until double in bulk, about 1 hour.  Lightly
grease a 2 1/2 to 3 quart casserole. Punch dough down, and beat with
spoon until smooth, about 30 seconds. Turn into casserole, cover and
let rise until double in bulk, 20 to 20 minutes. With a sharp knife,
cut a 4-inch cross, 1/2 inch deep, in top of dough. Bake at 375 F for
45 to 50 minutes, or until bread is nicely browned and sounds hollow
when rapped with knuckle. Remove to wire rack. Rub butter over top of
bread. Serve warm.
