Title: HOMEMADE HAND LOTION
Categories: Misc, Household
Yield: 1 Recipe
1/2    Gill glycerin
1/2    Gill alcohol
1/4 oz Gum traganth
1/2    Gill cologne
Dissolve gum in 1 cup lukewarm water.  Soft water should be used. Let
stand 24 hours or til it gels, then add other ingredients. Shake well
and dilute with warm soft water until the desired consistency is
obtained.

Personal note from Sherry - Nope, I don't know what gill is...other
than that it is obviously a unit of measure. I don't know what gum
tragacanth is either, but I thought some of you may enjoy looking at
this recipe and maybe figuring out what those things are!
