Title: HOT BABA GHANOUSH WITH PASTA
Categories: Pasta, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Eggplant
1/2 c  Lowfat Yogurt
2 tb Tahini
1/4 c  Dry Sherry
1/4 c  Lemon Juice
3    Cloves Garlic -- minced
1 tb Olive Oil
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts To 1/4 t Cayenne -- to taste
1/4 c  Fresh Parsley -- for
Garnish
1 lb Dry Pasta -- * see note
* spirals or wide ribbons are recommended.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut the eggplant in half, and place cut
side down on lightly oiled baking sheet. Pierce with fork several
times, then bake for 40 minutes, until really soft and collapsing.
When it has cooled, scoop out the insides and puree everything except
the parsley and pasta in a food processor or blender. Let sit awhile
to flavors can blend.

Bring several quarts of water to a boil and cook pasta al dente. While
pasta is cooking, gently heat the sauce. Drain the pasta and mix with
the sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley (you can also put parmesan on
this, it sounds really weird but is good - it's also good without
it!).
