double boiler over medium high heat. When the cream reaches 180
degrees, add the tartaric acid and stir it for 30 seconds. Remove the
cream from the stove and continue to stir for another 2 minutes.
Pour the cream into the lined strainer and refrigerate. When it is
cold, cover with plastic wrap. Let the cream sit in the refrigerator
for 12 to 18 hours.  It will become very thick and firm. Mascarpone
will keep for a week in the frig. She says it does not have quite the
creamy consistency of the store bought but is a good substitute. A
mail order source of the tartaric acid is STAR MART, 567 Golden Gate
Ave., San Francisco, CA 94102. It is also used in winemaking so might
be available for those suppliers too. Cherie Christensen
