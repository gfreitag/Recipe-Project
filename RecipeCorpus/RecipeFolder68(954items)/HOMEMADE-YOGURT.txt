There are several yogurt-making devices, but you can easily make it
at home in a large thermos bottle using a candy thermometer.
Sterilize all equipment in boiling water before using. Bring milk to
a boil, then cool to 100 degrees F. In a small bowl blend yogurt with
1/4 cup of warm milk. Whisk it back into warm milk. Pour into a
pre-warmed thermos, seal, and set aside in a warm place for 7 hours.
Turn yogurt out into a bowl set in a bowl of ice water, stirring to
quicken cooling. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours, or until
thickened. Sweeten to taste, if desired, and serve with raspberries.
Yogurt will keep for 4 to 5 days, covered and refrigerated.
