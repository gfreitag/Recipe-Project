Yield: 2 Servings
-New Basic's CB
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Celery salt
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Seasoned salt
1 1/2 c  Mixed unsalted roasted
-nuts
1 tb Coarse (kosher) salt
1 1/2    Cups
1. Preheat oven to 325_F.

2. Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan over low heat. Add the
remaining ingredients excepts the nuts and coarse salt. Simmer over
low heat for several minutes to combine flavors.

3. Add the nuts and stir until evenly coated. Spread on a baking
sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.

4. Toss the nuts with the coarse salt and let cool. Store in an
airtight container.

Adding a little spice just before a meal begins is an excellent way
to stimulate the taste buds and whet the appetite. We love this
recipe made with one favorite nut or a combination of many. We often
warm them just a bit in the oven before serving in a ceramic crock,
an antique basket, or an art deco silver bowl.
