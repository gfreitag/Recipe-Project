6 cl Garlic
3 c  Sugar

Wash peppers and slice into rings.  You can remove core and seeds or
leave intact.  In a 6 to 8 quart saucepan, combine sugar, vinegar,
water and pickling salt. Bring to a boil. Add sliced peppers and
return to a boil. Remove from heat.  Place a clove of garlic in each
hot, sterilized pint jar.  Use tongs to immediately fill jars with
hot peppers. Fill jars with brine, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.
Carefully run a nonmetallic utensil down inside of jars to remove
trapped air bubbles. Wipe jar tops and threads clean. Place hot lids
on jars and screw bands on firmly. Process in boiling water canner
for 5 minutes.

Note:  For smaller yield, halve ingredients. Processing times and
other directions remain the same.
