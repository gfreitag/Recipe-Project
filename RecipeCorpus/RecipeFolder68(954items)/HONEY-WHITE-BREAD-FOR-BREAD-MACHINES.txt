Title: HONEY WHITE BREAD FOR BREAD MACHINES
Categories: Breads, Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/4 c  Milk
3 tb Butter, unsalted
2 tb Honey
1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
3 c  Bread flour
3/4 ts Salt
Scald the milk. Remove from the heat and add in the butter and honey.
Stir until the butter melts. Let cool to room temperature. Add the
milk mixture and all remaining ingredients in the order suggested by
your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle
according to the manufacturer's directions. The bread is good warm,
cool, or toasted. It stales faster than store-brought white bread, so
wrap the loaf well and use quickly or freeze. Makes 1-1/2 pound loaf.
