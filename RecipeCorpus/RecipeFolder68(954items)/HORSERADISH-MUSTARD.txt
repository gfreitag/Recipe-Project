Title: HORSERADISH MUSTARD
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 /2 cup
1/2 c  Dry mustard, preferably
-imported
1/2 c  Hot tap water
1/2 c  White wine vinegar or
-Oriental rice vinegar
2 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
1 tb Bottled horseradish
1    Clove garlic, peeled
-and sliced
1 ts Sugar
6    Whole black peppercorns,
-crushed in a mortar, or
-pinch of ground black
-pepper
2    Whole allspice berries,
-crushed in a mortar, or
-small pinch ground allspice
A little dry white wine,
-or additional white wine
-vinegar if needed.
1.  Stir together the dry mustard and water and let stand, uncovered,
for 20 minutes, stirring once or twice. 2. In the container of a
blender or a food processor, combine the vinegar, salt, horseradish,
garlic, sugar, peppercorns, and allspice. Process until the garlic
and horseradish have been pureed in the liquid, then strain through a
fine-meshed strainer, pressing all juice from any pulp in the
strainer. 3. Combine the strained liquid with the mustard-water
mixture in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water.
Cook, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes, or until the mustard
has thickened (it will thicken more while cooling). 4. Cool and
taste.  Add more prepared horseradish, if desired, and if the mustard
seems too thick, thin it with a few drops of white wine or additional
vinegar. Makes about 1/2 cup
