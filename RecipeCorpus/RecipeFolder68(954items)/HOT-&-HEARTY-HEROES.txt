1 c  Thinly sliced green pepper
1/4 c  Italian salad dressing
1 tb Dijon mustard
1 pk Hot roll mix
1 c  Hot water (120F-130F)

5 oz Thinly sliced deli ham

In large skillet, cook onion and green pepper in salad dressing just
until tender.  Stir in mustard; remove from heat. Set aside.

Grease cookie sheet.  In large bowl combine flour mixture with yeast
from foil packet.  Stir in HOT water, 2 T oil and egg until dough
pulls away from sides of bowl. Turn dough out onto floured surface.
With greased or floured hands, shape dough into a ball. Knead dough
for 5 minutes until smooth. Sprinkle additional flour over surface to
reduce stickiness. Cover with large bowl; let rest 5 minutes.

On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 16x14" rectangle. Arrange
ham, salami and Swiss cheese lengthwise over half of dough,
overlapping slices; sprinkle with cheddar cheese.  Spread onion
mixture over meats and cheeses. Fold remaining half of dough over
filling. Pinch edges to seal; tuck ends under. Place on greased
cookie sheet. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and cloth
towel. Let rise in warm place (80 to 85F) 15 minutes.

Heat oven to 400F.  Uncover dough.  Brush with 1 T oil; sprinkle with
poppy seed.  Bake at 400F. for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden
brown. Let stand 15 to 30 minutes before serving. Cut in half
lengthwise, then make 10 crosswise cuts forming 20 slices. Submitted
