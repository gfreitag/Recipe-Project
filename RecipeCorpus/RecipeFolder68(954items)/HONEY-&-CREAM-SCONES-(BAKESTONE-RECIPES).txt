Title: HONEY & CREAM SCONES (BAKESTONE RECIPES)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
6 oz Whole wheat flour
6 oz Plain flour
2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1 ts Cream of tartar
1 oz Butter
5 fl Sour cream
4 oz Clear honey
1    Egg
Milk for glazing
Sift the flour, soda, and cream of tartar into a mixing bowl. Cut the
fat into the flour and rub it to a breadcrumb consistency. Miz the
sour cream and honey together until the honey is dissolved. Beat in
the egg. Make a well in the flour, pour in the liquid and mix to a
soft dough. Turn onto a floured board and knead in a little extra
flour if necessary. Roll out 1/2 inch thick and cut into rounds with
a 2-inch cutter. Lift onto a heated and greased bakestone and brush
the tops of the scones with a little milk.
Cook until the underside is golden, then turn and cook the other
side. Serve hot, split and spread with butter and honey: or serve
cold with butter or clotted cream.
