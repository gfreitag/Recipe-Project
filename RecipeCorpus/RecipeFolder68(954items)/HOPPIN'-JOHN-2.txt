Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Small dried peas such as
-cowpeas or black-eyes
6 c  Water
1    Dried hot pepper (opt)
1    Smoked ham hock
1 md Onion, chopped (~3/4 cup)

Wash and sort the peas. Place them in a saucepan, add the water, and
discard any peas that float. Gently boil the peas with the pepper,
ham hock and onion, uncovered, until tender but not mushy - about 1

pot, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, never lifting the lid.

Remove from the heat and allow to steam, still covered, for another 10
minutes. Remove the cover, fluff with a fork, and serve immediately.
