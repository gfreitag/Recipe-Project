Categories: Beverages, Holiday, Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM------------------FORMATTED BY JULIE LEWIS-----------------------
1    20 oz. container non-dairy
-coffee creamer
1    2 pound package nestles
-quick choc. drink mix
1 c  Powdered sugar
1    Bag miniature marshmallows
-(optional)
1    Pkg. nonfat powdered milk
-which yields 8-10 quarts
Mix all ingredients in a very large bowl and store in air tight
container. I mix mine in a Tupperware fix - n - mix bowl and just
store it in that. To serve, just heat water on the stove or in a mug
in the microwave. Also, the marshmallows will dry out and become
hard. That's fine - afterall, the ones in the commercial brands are
hard as little rocks!!! Use as much as you want to suit your own
taste. When I first received this recipe back in the early 80's
someone had taken the time to figure out that a serving of commercial
brand cocoa mix cost about 23 cents a serving while this recipe costs
about 7 cents.  Also, GENERICS WORK FINE in this recipe which will
save you even more.
