Title: HONEY PARTY BUNS
Categories: Breads, Sandwiches
Yield: 4 Dozen
1 c  Butter OR margarine; cut
-into pieces
1/2 c  Honey
2 c  Boiling water
2 pk Dry yeast (1/4 oz each)
1/3 c  Warm water (110-115 degrees)
2    Eggs; beaten
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
3 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
4 c  All-purpose flour (up to
-4-1/2 cups if needed)
Sliced ham, cheese and
-lettuce, opt.
Place butter and honey in large mixing bowl; pour the boiling water
over and set aside to cool to 110-115 degrees. In a small bowl,
dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside. To honey mixture, add eggs,
baking powder and salt.  Add yeast mixture and whole wheat flour;
beat until smooth. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft
dough. Turn onto a floured board; knead until smooth and elastic,
about 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease
top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down; divide in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll
each half to 1/2 inch thickness; cut with a 2-1/2 inch cutter. Place
on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
doubled, about 1 hour.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes or
until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks. Make into
small sandwiches, if desired, by filling with ham, cheese and
lettuce, or serve plain.  Yield: 4-5 dozen. (I would think you could
fill them with anything you liked, ham salad, chicken salad,
whatever!)
