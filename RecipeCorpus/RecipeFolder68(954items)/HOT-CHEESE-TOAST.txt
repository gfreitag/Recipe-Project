Title: HOT CHEESE TOAST
Categories: Appetizers, Cocktail, Cheese, Breads, Do ahead
Yield: 24 Strips
8 sl Bacon; cooked; crumbled
1/3 c  Mayonnaise
1 c  Shredded sharp Cheddar
Cheese
1 sm Onion; grated
1    Egg; lightly beaten
Freshly ground pepper
1/8 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
Several dashes Tabasco sauce
8 sl Firm white day-old bread
Cook bacon by placing on a rack over a shallow pan and bake at 350
degrees for about 20 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels
and set aside.

Combine all ingredients except bread in a bowl. Crumble bacon and add
to mixture; set aside.

Cut crusts from bread slices and toast on both sides. Spread each
slice generously with cheese mixture; then cut each slice into three
long strips. Sprinkle with paprika; place on baking sheet, cover with
waxed paper and refrigerate.  This may be done the day before. Remove
from refrigerator 30 minutes before ready to bake; bake at 350
degrees for about 20 minutes, or until light brown and puffy.  Serve
hot. Double the recipe for a cocktail party of 20.

Note:  These strips are quite filling.  For a daintier appetizer, cut
strips in half before baking.  These are delicious nd versatile,
providing a good luncheon or brunch dish. They should be served with
sliced tomatoes and garnished with parsley clusters; in which case,
serve two whole bread slices per person, not cutting into strips. MM
