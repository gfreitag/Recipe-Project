Title: HONEYED ONIONS WITH CURRANTS - MARTHA STEWART
Categories: Vegetables, Sides, Soup/stews
Yield: 1 Cup
2 lg Spanish onions
1 tb Unsalted butter
3 tb Honey
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Dried currants
Peel and cut onions in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4-inch-thick
semicircles. Place in a large skillet with butter, 1 1/4 C water,
honey vinegar, and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil; cook over
medium-low heat until most of the liquid has evaporated and onions
are very soft, about 40 minutes. Continue to cook until onions are a
deep golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Add water as needed to keep
onions from scorching. Stir in currants and serve.
