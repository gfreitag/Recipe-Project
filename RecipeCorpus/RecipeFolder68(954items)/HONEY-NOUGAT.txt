Categories: Candies, Gift
Yield: 20 Servings
1 c  Hazelnuts
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
3/4 c  Honey
1    Egg white
Toast hazelnuts in moderate oven on oven tray for 10 minutes. While
nuts are warm, rub off skins using a clean tea-towel.

Place sugar and water in small saucepan, stir over low heat until
sugar is dissolved. Cook syrup, without stirring, until it reaches
140 degrees C when tested with a sweets thermometer or until syrup
reaches soft crack stage. Stir honey into syrup and return to the
boil until temperature is 140 degrees when tested with a sweets
thermometer or until syrup reaches soft crack stage. Beat egg white
until stiff peaks form, continue to beat egg white while adding the
hot syrup in a thin stream. Beat mixture constantly until it thickens
and becomes stiff. Fold through hazelnuts, pour into lightly greased
18 cm square pan. Allow to cool and set overnight. Cut into bars
using a wet knife. Wrap each piece of nougat in cellophane;
refrigerate until required.

Makes about 20.
