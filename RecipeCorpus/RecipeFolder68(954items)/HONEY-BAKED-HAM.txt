Title: HONEY BAKED HAM
Categories: Pork, Meats, Wine
Yield: 10 Servings
-CAROLE ROCK (TSTW72B)
1    Smoked ready-to-eat ham,
-13 to 15 pounds
2    To 3 bottles gingerale
3 c  Dry white wine
GLAZE:
5 tb Dijon mustard
1/3 c  Honey
1/3 c  Real maple syrup
SAUCE:
1 1/4 c  Chicken stock
3 tb Real maple syrup
2 tb Dijon mustard
2 ts Cornstarch
Remove the rind and score with diagonal cross-cuts. Put ham in a close
fitting kettle and cover with gingerale. Bring to boil, then simmer
for 20 to 30 minutes. This step removes the too salty taste and adds
a delicate flavor. Drain the gingerale, add ham to a roasting pan and
pour the wine over it.  Cover with foil and bake at 350~ for 1 hour.

Combine the glaze ingredients.  After the ham has baked 1 hour, brush
the ham with the glaze, using all of the mixture. Return ham to oven
(uncovered) and bake an additional 1-1/2 hours, or until internal temp
reaches 140~.  Baste occasionally after the glaze has "set", about 45
minutes.  If the glaze gets too dark before the temp gets to 140
degrees, tent the ham with foil.

When ham is done, transfer it to a serving plate and loosely cover
with foil to keep warm.  Skim the fat from the juices, reserving all
the juice and caramelized bits from the glaze. Heat this to a boil
along with 1 cup of the chicken stock (reserving 1/4 cup), syrup and
mustard. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup of reserved chicken stock
and whisk it into the sauce to thicken.  The sauce should be a rich
dark color. Strain and pour into a gravy boat.  Serve the sauce over
the ham.

NOTE *** In step 1, "close fitting kettle" means the tightest fitting
kettle you can fit the ham into, so it takes less gingerale to cover
it.
