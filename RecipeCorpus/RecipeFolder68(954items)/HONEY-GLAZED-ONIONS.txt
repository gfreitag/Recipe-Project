MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
10 md Onions, sweet variety
1 c  Seasoned breadcrumbs
1 c  Corn kernels
1 c  Zucchini, diced

1/2 c  Honey

2 ts Paprika (Which?)*
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
Preheat oven to 350F.  Peel onion, slice in halfon the equator. Remove
centres leaving a bowl in the onion halves. FILLING: In a bowl, stir
together 1/2 c breadcrumbs, corn, zucchini, carrots & beets. Firmly
pack into onion hollows.  Arrange in a shallow baking dish & pour
water around the base. GLAZE: In a separate bowl, whisk together the
glaze ingredients. Drizzle half the mixture over the top of the
onions. Bake 30 minutes. Drizzle with remaining glaze & bake another
30 minutes. Just before serving, sprinkle onions with remaining
breadcrumbs & broil until the crumbs are toasted & golden brown. *
The recipe doesn't state which paprika, but I would opt for the
sweeter Hungarian variety.
