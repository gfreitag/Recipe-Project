Title: HONEY-HAZELNUT SPREAD
Categories: Spreads, Condiments
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 c  Oregon hazelnut kernels
1 c  (12 oz.) whipped honey
Yield: 1-1/2 cups.

Place hazelnuts in a single layer in a 9- to 10-inch wide pan and
bake in a 350 oven until golden throughout (cut one in half to check
color) 10 to 12 minutes. Let nuts cool. To remove skins, place nuts
in a clean towel and rub gently to loosen peel. The nuts do not need
to be completely skinned. Place nuts in a food processor or blender.
Whirl, pulse on and off, just until finely chopped; do not whirl into
a paste. In a bowl, combine honey and nuts; mix to blend. Serve, or
pack into small containers and cover. Store in cool place up to 1
month.
