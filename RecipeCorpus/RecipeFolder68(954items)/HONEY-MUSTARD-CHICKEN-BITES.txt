Categories: Chicken, Appetizers, Spicy

3 tb Honey
2 tb Catsup
1    Minced Garlic Clove
1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
1 lb Boned, Skinless Chicken

These tangy chunks of chicken, easily made with "on hand"
ingredients, are a good change of pace from Buffalo chicken wings.
~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- In a medium bowl, mix the mustard, honey, catsup,
garlic and Tabasco sauce. Set aside 1/4 cup of the mixture; add the
chicken to the rest and stir to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for at
least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Preheat the broiler.  Arrange the chicken pieces on a rack in the
broiler pan and broil, turning once and brushing with the marinade,
until the chicken is tender, about 10 minutes. Serve with the
reserved sauce as a dip.
