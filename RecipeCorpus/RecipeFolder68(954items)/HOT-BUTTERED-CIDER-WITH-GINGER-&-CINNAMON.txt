boil, reduce the heat, and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and
stir in the cloves, allspice, cinnamon and ginger. Let the mixture
stand for 1 hour or longer. Strain into a bowl and return to the
saucepan. Stir in the apple cider, orange juice and lemon juice.
Serve in mugs with a slice of butter on top and a cinnamon stick.

Note: The punch may be prepared several hours ahead and reheated
before serving, if desired.
