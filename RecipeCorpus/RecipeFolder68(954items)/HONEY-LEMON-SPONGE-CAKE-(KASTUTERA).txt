Categories: Dessert:, Cakes
1 c  sugar
plus 1 tablespoon
Yield: 1 Servings
:
1/4 c  honey
1 ts vanilla
1 ts lemon extract
1/4 ts salt
7 lg eggs -- separated
1 c  cake flour -- sifted
1/8 ts cream of tartar

1.  Preheat oven to 325F.  Use parchment to line the bottom of a 10
inch tube pan, preferably with a removable bottom. Grease the
parchment. In a large bowl, whisk 1 cup sugar, honey, vanilla, lemon
extract, and salt into egg yolks. Place bowl in a large pan of hot
water. With an electric mixer, beat about 5 minutes on medium-high
speed until pale yellow and doubled in volume. Gently fold in sifted
flour.

2.  Wash beaters.  In a large bowl, beat egg whites in electric mixer
on a low speed 1 minute, increasing speed to medium-high. When foamy,
sprinkle in 1 tablespoon sugar and cream of tartar. Beat until stiff
but not dry. With a spatula, fold the egg whites in thirds. Pour
batter into pan. Tap gently on the counter to remove air bubbles.

3.  Bake on middle rack of oven 35 to 45 minutes or until golden
brown. When done, cake sides will pull away from pan slightly; top
will be flat and feel spongy when pressed with finger. Cool 20
minutes. Run a small knife between edge of cake and pan. Remove from
pan carefully. Pull off parchment and cool completey. Serve or store
airtight.
