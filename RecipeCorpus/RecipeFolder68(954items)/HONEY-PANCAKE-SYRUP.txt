Title: HONEY PANCAKE SYRUP
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Water
1 c  HONEY
1 ts Vanilla
Heat water in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add honey just before
boiling. Stir well until combined- do not boil. Remove from heat -
stir in vanilla. Store in covered jar or syrup dispenser in the
refrigerator. Honey can be used straight from the jar on pancakes -
but this syrup pours nicely and dilutes the overwhelming sweetnees of
honey. From Connecticut Honey by Eastern Connecticut Beekeepers
