NOTE: We use Saco buttermilk powder and adjust the water accordingly.

ROLLS:  These our one of our favorite rolls.  We let the machine do
the work through the MANUAL method (or DOUGH cycle). Then kneed again
adding some flour if the dough is sticky. shape into rolls and allow
to rise until doubled in bulk.  I usually do this on top of the dryer
when it is in use. Then I bake at 375 degrees until lightly browned.
Sometimes I use an egg wash and sprinkle with seeds of our choice;
sesame or caraway.
