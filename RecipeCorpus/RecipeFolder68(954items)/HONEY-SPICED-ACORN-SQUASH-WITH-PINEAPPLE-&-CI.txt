minutes or until squash is tender.

Into a large bowl, scoop out the pulp and mash it. Add the remaining

greased porcelain baker and bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes

Judi's Notes:  I cut the honey to only 2 tablespoons and did not use
the salt in this recipe due to my sodium restrictions. Instead I
added freshly ground pepper to taste and it turned out very well. I
believe I also used more cinnamon and nutmeg than was called for in
the recipe.
