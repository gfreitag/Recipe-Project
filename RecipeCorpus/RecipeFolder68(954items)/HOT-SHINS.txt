Title: HOT SHINS
Categories: Barbeque, Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
16 ea Chicken Drumsticks (2 /12 to
-3 1/2 pounds)
1/4 c  Flour
2 ts Paprika
1 ts Black pepper, ground
1 ts White pepper, ground
1 ts Cayenne pepper, ground
1 ts Thyme, ground
1 ts Garlic, powder
1 ts Salt
The day before you plan to serve these drumsticks, lay them out on a
cutting board or butcher block and pierce them all over with a fork so
that, when they are seasoned, the spices will permeate the meat
nicely. Set aside.

Measure into a Ziploc-type plastic bag the flour, paprika, black,
white, and cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and salt. Close the
bag and shake to blend the spice well.

Add the drumsticks to the bag, zip it shut again, and shake until the
drumsticks are thoroughly coated with the seasoning. Refrigerate
overnight.

The following day, about 2 hours before dinnertime, fire up your
smoker and, when the coals are glowing, add some wet wood to the fire
pan and fill the water pan halfway with hot water. Transfer the
drumsticks from their bag to the grill and cover the smoker snugly.

Smoke at 200 to 220 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the juice
runs clear when the meat is pricked and the drums are lusciously
tender.
