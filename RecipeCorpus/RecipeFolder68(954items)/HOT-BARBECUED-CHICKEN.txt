Title: HOT BARBECUED CHICKEN
Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Chicken (3 lb)
Juice of 1-1/2 lemons
2    Cloves garlic, (see note)
1 tb Fresh ground black pepper
2 tb Ground cayenne pepper
1 tb Paprika
2 tb Melted butter
NOTE: the two cloves of garlic should be crushed with
1    tablespoon of salt. Split and butterfly the chicken by
cutting down the backbone and opening the chicken leaving the breast
attached. Squeeze lemon juice over the chicken.  Mix together the
garlic, peppers, and paprika, and add to the melted butter. Pour over
chicken. If possible, let the chicken sit overnight, uncovered, in
the refrigerator. Prepare the grill.  Place the chicken, breast side
up, on the grill. Cover the grill and cook chicken for 50 minutes or
until done. Don't turn. If the skin is not crispy, place the chicken
under the broiler to crisp the skin and brown, watching carefully so
that it doesn't burn.
