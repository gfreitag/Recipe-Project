Charcoal-grilled fish takes on a new level of flavor when marinated
in this wonderful sauce, intensified by a full tablespoon of Tabasco
sauce. ~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Prepare a charcoal fire for grilling. In a shallow
dish, mix the lemon juice, butter, oil, parsley, sesame seeds,
Tabasco sauce, ginger, and salt. With a fork, pierce the skin of each
fish in several places. Roll the fish in the lemon juice mixture to
coat thoroughly. Leave the fish in the marinade, cover the dish and
refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning the fish occasionally.

Remove the fish, reserving the marinade, and place them in a hand-held
hinged grill.  Brush the fish with the marinade. Cook about 4 inches
from the hot coals for 5 minutes. Turn, brush with marinade, and cook
for 5 minutes longer, or until the flesh appears opaque and flakes
easily.
