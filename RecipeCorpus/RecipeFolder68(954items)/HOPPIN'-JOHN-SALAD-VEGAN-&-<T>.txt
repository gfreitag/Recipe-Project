Title: HOPPIN' JOHN SALAD VEGAN & <T>
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------WHOLESOME HARVEST--------------------------
1 1/4 c  Cooked or canned (rinsed
And drained) black-eyed
Peas
1/3 c  Chopped onion
6 tb Distlled white vinegar
1 1/2 c  Cooked brown rice
2 tb Water
1    10-oz  pkg. frozed chopped
Spinach, thawed and well
Drained
1/4 ts Pepper
2 tb Baco Bits (optional)
In a large bowl, toss the black-eyed peas, rice, spinach, and onion
until completely combined.

In a small bowl, stir together the vinegar, water, and pepper. Pour
over the salad and toss.  Chill for at least a few hours to let
flavors blend. Sprinkle on the Baco Bits (if you use them), toss
again, and serve.

Note:  I've never made this with the Baco Bits and think it is just
fine without them.

Note 2:  One of these days I'm going to have to try to redeem my
reputation as a cook and submit a <T>-ed recipe more complicated than
"Dump all this stuff together and put it in the refrigerator"!!
