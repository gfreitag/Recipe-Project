Title: HONEY ALMOND TWIST (BASIC SWEET DOUGH)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2    Recipe Basic Sweet Dough
1/4 c  Lightly salted butter
3 tb All-purpose flour
3 tb Honey
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Chopped blanched or un
-blanched almonds
Grease a 10-inch pie plate or round cake pan.

With the palms of your hands, roll the Basic Sweet Dough into a long
narrow roll about 1 inch in diameter. Coil the roll into the prepared
pan, starting at the outside edge and twisting the roll as you go.
Leave a little space between each coil. Cover and let rise in a warm
place until almost doubled in volume, about 35 minutes.

Heat the oven to 350F.  Melt the butter in a small pan. Remove from
the heat, stir in the flour and then the remaining ingredients. Spoon
the mixture over the risen dough.

Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until done.  Place the pan on a rack to
cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. Serve from the pan.

Makes one large twist.
