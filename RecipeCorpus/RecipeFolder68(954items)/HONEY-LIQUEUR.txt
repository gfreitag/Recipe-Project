Title: HONEY LIQUEUR
Categories: Liqueurs
Yield: 1 Quart
2 c  Vodka or brandy
3/4 lb Honey
3 tb Orange rind, or 1/2 the
Peel of an orange
1 c  Water, warm but not boiling
1    Clove
2    Cinnamon sticks, 2 inches ea
Peel the orange find in one long spiral if possible, particularly if
you want an attractive presentation. Disolve the honey in the water
and add to the vodka and spices in an attractive bottle with the
orange peel.

Let stand, well corked shaking every few days.  I like the flavor well
developed, and do not usually strain it at all, but check it after 2
or 3 weeks, and if you don't want too strong an orange spice flavor,
strain the peel and spices out and rebottle. Submitted By
