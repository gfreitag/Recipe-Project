Title: HONEY ORANGE BISCOTTI LF
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
2 c  Flour
1/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Dried grated orange rind
1/3 c  Chopped pecans or currants
-(optional)
1/4 c  Fat-free egg substitute plus
2 tb Fat-free egg substitute
(can use egg whites)
2 tb Honey
2 tb Frozen orange juice concen
-trate, thawed
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and
orange rind and stir to mix well. Add the pecans or currants if
desired and stir to mix. Add the remaining ingredients and stir just
until the dough holds together.

2. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape into two 8
x 2 inch logs. (If the dough is too sticky to handle, knead in a
little more flour.) Flatten out the logs a little bit or else the
crust will split and crack. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking
spray and place the logs on the sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for
about 23 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer the logs to a
wire rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

3. Place the logs on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to
slice the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place the
slices on a baking sheet and bake at 300 degrees F for 20 minutes or
until lightly browned, turning after 10 minutes.

4. Transfer the biscotti to wire racks and cool completely. Serve
immediately or store in an airtight container.

NOTE: These are very easy to make and taste great. I made them
without the pecans or currants, so there were even less fat and
calories.
