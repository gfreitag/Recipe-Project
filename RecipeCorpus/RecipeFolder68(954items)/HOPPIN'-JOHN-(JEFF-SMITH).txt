Title: HOPPIN' JOHN (JEFF SMITH)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 -6
1 c  Dried fried peas (cowpeas)
4 c  Water
1 md Onion, sliced
1/2 lb Bacon, thick sliced, cut
-into 1/2 inch pieces
1 c  Raw long grain rice
1 ts Salt
Black pepper,
-freshly ground, to taste
Put the peas and water in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer and cook the peas, covered, until just barely
tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes. You will have to add additional
water during the cooking process.  Watch that the peas do not dry
out. Drain the peas, reserving the water, and return them to the
kettle.

Saute the onion along with the bacon until the onion is clear. Add to
the pot along with the rice and 2 1/2 cups of the reserved liquid.
Add the seasonings. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer
for 15 minutes, covered.  Allow the dish to rest off the heat for 10
minutes before you lift the lid.

This dish looks like a normal starch dish, but the name is
intriguing. In the South it is served as often as you wish, but
always on New Year's Day, in which case it is to bring you good luck.
I am told that the children were so fond of this dish in the old days
that they would hop about the kitchen waiting for it to cook thus
giving it the name.

It can be made with black-eyed peas, red lentils, or dried field
peas, but the remaining ingredients are always constant.
