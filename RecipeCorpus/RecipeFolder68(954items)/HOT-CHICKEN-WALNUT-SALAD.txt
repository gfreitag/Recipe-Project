1. Lightly mix romaine, chicory, and tomatoes; cover and refrigerate
if done ahead.

2. Using flat side of a meat mallet, pound chicken breasts between
pieces of waxed paper, to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Cut into
bite-sized strips about 1/2 inch wide; sprinkle with salt and pepper.

3. In a large frying pan, heat oil and lightly brown half the chicken,
stirring and turning over medium-high heat until cooked through
(about 3 minutes); remove from pan. Add remaining chicken and cook as
above. Return all the chicken to the pan and mix in onion, garlic,
and walnuts. Cook, stirring, until onion is limp (about 2 minutes).
Stir in vinegar; remove from heat.

4. Place greens on 4 plates. Spoon hot chicken mixture over greens,
dividing it evenly. Serve with Walnut Oil Dressing to add to each
serving to taste.

Walnut Oil Dressing: In a medium bowl mix vinegar, lemon juice,
mustard, salt, and pepper. Using a whisk or fork, gradually beat in
oil until well blended and thickened. Makes 2/3 cup.
