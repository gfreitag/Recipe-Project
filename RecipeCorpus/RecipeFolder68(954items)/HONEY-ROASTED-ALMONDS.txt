2 c  Whole almonds; with
Skins
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Honey
2 tb ;water
2 ts Almond or vegetable oil
Spread the almonds in a single layer in a shallow ungreased baking
pan and place in a cold oven.  Bake at 350 degrees, stirring
occasionally, until the internal color of nuts is tan (about 12 to 15
minutes). Remove from oven and set aside.  Thoroughly mix the sugar
and salt. Stir together the honey, water and oil in a medium size pan
and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Stir in the roasted almonds
and continue to cook and stir until all the liquid has been absorbed
by the nuts (about 5 minutes). Immediately transfer to a medium bowl
and sprinkle sugar mixture over all and toss. Spread on wax paper and
cool. Makes about 2 cups.
