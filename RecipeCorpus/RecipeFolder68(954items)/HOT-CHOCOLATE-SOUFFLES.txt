Title: HOT CHOCOLATE SOUFFLES
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
9 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
4 lg Egg yolks
2 tb Dark rum
1 tb Unsalted butter, melted
6 lg Egg whites
1 pn Cream of tartar
In the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, melt the
chocolate, stirring, until it is smooth. Remove the pan from the
heat, add the egg yolks, one at a time, whisking well after each
addition, and whisk in the rum and butter.  Transfer mixture to a
large bowl.

In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the cream
of tartar and a pinch of salt until they hold stiff peaks. Stir a
quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture then fold in the
remaining egg whites gently but thoroughly.  Spoon the mixture into 6
buttered 2/3 cup souffle dishes and bake them on a baking sheet in
the middle of a preheated 400f oven for 10-12 minutes, or until they
are puffed and a tester comes out nearly clean.
