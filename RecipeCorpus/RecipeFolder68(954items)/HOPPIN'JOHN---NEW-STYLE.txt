Title: HOPPIN'JOHN - NEW STYLE
Categories: Vegetarian, Southern, Low-fat, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Black-eyed Peas, cooked
1/2 c  Rice, white or brown
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Celery, chopped
1/2 c  Onion, chopped, or
1/4 c  Green pepper, chopped
4-5 green spring onions, chp
4 oz Mushrooms, sliced, canned
2 ts Poultry Seasoning
4    Tomatoes, crushed
1/2 ts Red pepper, crushed (opt)
Directions: Combine ingredients in a stockpot or crockpot, and cook
until rice is done, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. A little more liquid
may have to be added. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking as the
mixture thickens whichever method is used. In crockpot, cook about 4
hours on high, and 6-7 hours on low heat.

Cook's Note:  In any authentic Southern cookbook, there will almost
always be a recipe for Hoppin' John, which is basically a combination
of rice and black- eyed peas. To this basic recipe, each cook will
add his/her personal touches and I have added mine. White rice is
traditional, but brown rice has more fiber. Tomatoes are optional.
Mushrooms are a modern touch. In some areas, red pepper sauce or
tabasco sauce replaces the crushed red pepper.  In Texas, Purple Hull
peas are frequently used, with Picante Sauce served on the side. In
Louisiana, Red Beans and Rice are the popular combination. In other
places, is found the combination of black beans and rice as the
popular dish.
