Title: HONEY BUTTER SPREAD
Categories: Spreads
Yield: 8 Servings
1/4 c  Soft butter or margarine
1 tb Honey.
Stir to combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices of bread. Because
the honey promotes browning, use this on pockets which only have to
brown and heat through. If used on egg sandwiches,etc... the bread
may over brown before the egg finishes cooking.
