Title: HOT & COLD SHRIMP (GOONG KOB POH)
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
1 kg Medium size fresh shrimp
7    Red hot chili
3    Cloves garlic
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Hot water
2 tb Lime juice
1 tb Hot sauce *
1 tb Chopped coriander
* (Sriracha or Sambel
-Lampung) [Sriracha is a
Thai hot sauce, available here, and comes in several varieties++ from
mildly warm to blisteringly hot. Some of them are quite similar to a
thick Tabasco sauce which is what I would use for a substitute. S.C.]

Here is a recipe from my new Thai cookbook that is mainly a dip,
since the shrimp are either grilled or eaten raw with the rest of the
ingredients. I haven't made this yet, but the dip sounds quite
similar to the Vietnamese "Nuoc Cham" (which would be good also.)

Peel shrimp, remove the center black line, leave the tail on. Clean
and drain, arrange on a plate, chill for 2 hours. Pound the chili and
garlic until fine. Place into a small bowl. Mix sugar, salt and hot
water and stir until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over pounded chili and
garlic. Add lime juice and hot sauce, stir and top with chopped
coriander.

To Serve:  Thread the shrimp onto the sticks.  Cook over charcoal
until done to satisfaction.  Dip in prepared sauce to taste. It can
be served raw and cold.
