Hot Apple Muffins TOPPING: To prepare the topping, core and peel the
apples, keeping them whole. Cut each one into 4 to 5 thick rings. Mix
the sugar and cinnamon together and coat the apple rings. Reserve.

MUFFIN: Sift together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. In
another bowl beat the eggs, add the milk and melted butter. Stir the
liquid very quickly into the flour mixture - do not beat and do not
worry about lumps. Speed is essential. Fold in the chopped apples.
Fill 24 (5in.) greased muffins tins or paper cases, filled to
one-third, and put one cinnamon apple ring on each muffin.

Bake in a preheated hot oven 425F, for 15 to 25 minutes, until cooked.
Remove from tins and serve hot.

Servings: 24
