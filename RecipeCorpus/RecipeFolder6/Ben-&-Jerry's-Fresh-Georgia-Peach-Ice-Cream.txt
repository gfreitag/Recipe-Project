The best way to capture the elusive flavore of summertime. Ben and Jerry
prefer small peaches because they have more flavor and less water than the
larger ones. Combine the peaches, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the lemon juice
in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, stirring the mixture every 30
minutes. Remove the peaches from the refrigerator and drain the juice into
another bowl. Return the peaches to the refrigerator. Whisk the eggs in a
mxing bowl until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 3/4
cup sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely
blended, about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to
blend. Add the peach juice and blend. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream
maker and freeze following manufacturer's instructions. After the ice cream
stiffens (about 2 minutes before if is sone) add the peaches, then continue
freezing until the ice cream is ready. Makes 1 generous quart.
