Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian, Beans, Salsa
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 ts Liquid smoke
1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Pepper
1/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
Cooking spray (optional)
1 c  Tomato-based salsa
- homemade or purchased
1 1/2 tb Salad oil
1 sm Onion; finely chopped
1/4 c  Red bell pepper
- (finely chopped)
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 md Fresh jalapeno chili
- seeded & finely chopped
2 cn Pinto beans (15 oz each)
- drained & rinsed
In a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat, combine 1 1/2
teaspoons of the oil with the onion, bell pepper, garlic and chili.  Stir
often until onion is limp but not browned, about 5 minutes.

In a bowl, coarsely mash beans with a potato masher until they stick
together.  Stir in onion mixture, liquid smoke, cilantro, cumin, and
pepper, mixing well.

Spread cornmeal on a sheet of waxed paper.  When bean mixture is cool to
touch, divide into 8 equal portions, shaping each into a 1/2-inch thick
cake.  Coat cakes with cornmeal.

Return the frying pan to medium-high heat.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil.
When oil is hot, add cakes and brown lightly, 8 to 10 minutes; turn cakes
over once.  Coat pan with cooking oil spray if cakes start to stick. Serve
cakes with salsa to add to taste.
