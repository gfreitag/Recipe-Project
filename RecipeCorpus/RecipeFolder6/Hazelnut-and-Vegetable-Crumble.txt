Title: Hazelnut and Vegetable Crumble
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
2/3 c  Hazelnuts
-chopped or slivered
1 sm Onion; peeled and grated
1    Garlic clove; crushed
1/2 ts Dried thyme
-OR- herbes de Provence
2 lb Peeled, diced vegetables:
-Carrots, Rutabagas,
-Turnips, Onions, Celery
1/4 lb Butter or vegan margarine
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 c  Rolled oats
Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Broil the vegetables in water to cover for
15-20 minutes, or until tender.  Drain, reserving the water.

Blend about one-third of the vegetables with 2 tablespoons of the butter or
vegan margarine and enough of the reserved water to make a puree in a food
processor or blender.

Add this puree to the rest of the vegetables.  Season to taste with salt
and pepper.  Spoon the mixture into a shallow ovenproof casserole.

To make the crumble topping, put the oats into a bowl with all the nuts,
the onion, garlic, herbs and salt and pepper.  Add the rest of the butter
or vegan margarine, and mix with a fork until the topping mixture resembles
coarse breadcrumbs.

Sprinkle the crumble mixture evenly over the top of the vegetables.  Bake
for 30-40 minutes, until topping is crisp and lightly browned.
