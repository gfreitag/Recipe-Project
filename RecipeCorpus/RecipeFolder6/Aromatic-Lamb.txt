Title: Aromatic Lamb
Categories: Meats, Lamb
Yield: 8 servings
Olive oil
Butter
Rosemary, thyme & oregano
1    Leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)
3 lb Potatoes (about 5 oz each)
Lemon (may be doubled)
Honey
Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan.  Bruise the leaves of 2 or 3
sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat.  Add plenty of pepper
and 1 tablespoon honey.  Rub the mixture into the meat with your hands.
Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing the juice on to the meat as
you do so.  Do not add any salt.  Leave to marinate for 4 to 24 hours.

Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer
round the lamb.  Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at least half
a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong citrus flavour.
Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the roasting pan, then
sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2 tablespoons chopped fresh
rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh chopped thyme and oregano, and
some salt and pepper.  Drizzle on 1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon
olive oil, then dot with 1 oz butter.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for
a further 1 to 1-1/4 hours.  The ingredients will become gilded and will
burnish to a rich brown in places.  Lift the meat and turn the potatoes
occasionally, and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to
prevent drying out.
