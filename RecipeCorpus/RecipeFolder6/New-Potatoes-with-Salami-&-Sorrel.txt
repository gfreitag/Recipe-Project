Title: New Potatoes with Salami & Sorrel
Categories: Salads
Yield: 2 servings
Coriander seed
Wholegrain mustard
Olive oil
White wine vinegar
1 lb Small new potatoes
1 sm Handful of sorrel
2 oz Italian salami (or more)
-- thinly sliced
1 sm Onion
Chop the onion roughly and partially soften it in 2 generous tablespoons of
the oil.  Do not let it brown.  Scrub the potatoes (but on no account peel
them) and steam them.  Wash and dry the sorrel, discarding tough stalks.
Roll up the leaves tighly in your fingers, just a few at a time, as though
making a cigarette, and snip across into fine ribbons.

Tip the softened onion and its juices into a big bowl.  Stir in 1/2
teaspoon each vinegar and mustard, some salt and lots of pepper and
coriander seed.  The coriander seed should be freshly toasted and ground
coarsely using a pestle and mortar or a spare peppermil.  Add the potatoes
to the bowl while still piping hot, so they drink up the flavours of the
dressing.  Cut each potato in half or into quarters depending on size, and
toss gently.  Scatter some of the sorrel over the base of a shallow serving
dish.  Pile the potatoes into the centre, encircle them with the sliced
salami and scatter the remaining ribbons of sorrel over the top. Serve
while potatoes are still warm.
