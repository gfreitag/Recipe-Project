Ben and Jerry have been making Oreo Mint ever since they opened their first
store in the gas station. it was their top-selling flavor for a long time
and was only recently nudged out of first place by Heath Bar Crunch. Place
the cookies in a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Whisk the eggs in a mxing
bowl until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a little at a
time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more.
Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend. add the peppermint extract
and blend again. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze
following manufacturer's instructions. After the ice cream stiffens, about
2 minutes before it is done, add the chopped cookies, then continue
freezing until the ice cream is ready. Makes 1 generous quart.
