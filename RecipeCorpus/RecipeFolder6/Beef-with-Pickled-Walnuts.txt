Title: Beef with Pickled Walnuts
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
2    Bay leaves
3 tb Beef dripping or olive oil
1 1/2 oz Flour
1 pt (scant) light stock
2 1/4 lb Stewing steak
1/2 lb Ox kidney
4    Onions
1 lb Carrots
6    Pickled walnuts (or more)
Prepare the meats in the usual way, removing all traces of fat, gristle and
membrane, and cut into large chunks.  Cut the onions into one-eighths.
Scrub or scrape the carrots and cut them into 1/2 to 3/4 inch lengths. Toss
with the meats, onions and carrots in the flour (which should be
well-seasoned) and brown and seal, in batches, in sizzling hot frying pan
barely filmed with dripping or well-flavoured oil.  Transfer to a
flameproof casserole.  "Wash out" the frying pan with some of the stock and
add it to the casserole.  Add the rest of the stock, 2 tablespoons juice
from the jar of pickled walnuts and the bay leaves.  Season with salt and
pepper and bring to simmering point. Cover and cook at 300 F (150 C) gas
mark 2 for about 3 hours until the meats are very tender and the gravy is
deliciously rich.

Add the quartered or sliced walnuts to the beef.  Check the stew for
seasoning and cook for about 15 minutes more before serving.
