Yield: 3 servings
2 tb Minced fresh parsley

1 ts Soy sauce
1 ds Garlic powder
6 oz Tempeh
1/4 c  Mayonnaise*
1    Celery stalk, finely chopped

Steam tempeh for 20 minutes.  Allow to cool enough to handle.  Cut into
cubes slightly smaller than 1/2 inch.  Combine with remaining ingredients &
mix lightly.  Serve on a bed of lettuce or as a sandwich filling.

pepper, lemon juice & a crushed garlic clove.
