Title: Chicken Liver Stroganoff
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 oz Unsalted or clarified butter
1/2 pt Soured cream
3 tb Fairly acid yoghurt
1 lb Chicken livers
1/2 lb Cap mushrooms
2    Onions
Thoroughly heat a large saute or frying pan.  Add a scant 1/2 oz of the
butter and tilt so that the fat runs sizzling all over the pan base.  Add
the mushrooms (whole if small or sliced thickly if large) and saute over
high heat for 5 minutes.  Remove and keep hot.

Add the rest of the butter to the pan, then the onions which should be
thinly sliced and pushed into rings.  Cook very gently indeed for 15-20
minutes until beautifully softened.  Meanwhile stir the yoghurt into the
soured cream and season very generously with salt and pepper; trim the
chicken livers and pat them dry with kitchen paper.

Lift the onions out of the pan with a slotted spoon, so all the buttery
juices drip back into the pan, and keep them hot.  Increase the heat under
the pan and saute the chicken livers for about 3 minutes so they become
crusted with brown on the outside, but remain deliciously pink and tender
within.

Return the mushrooms and onions to the pan and immediately pour on the
seasoned soured cream.  Let the sauce bubble up and cook for a few minutes
until it is very hot, slightly reduced and thickened.  Stir gently every
now and again to encourage the sauce to cling creamily to the meat and
vegetables.  Check seasoning and serve without delay.  Green beans and
triangles of fried bread go well with this dish, and I like to accompany it
with plenty of crusty hot French bread to mop up every luscious drop of
sauce.  More substantially, you could substitute rice or thin ribbons of
pasta for the bread.
