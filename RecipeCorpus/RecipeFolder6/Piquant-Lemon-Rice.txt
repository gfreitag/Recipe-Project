Title: Piquant Lemon Rice
Categories: Rice/grains, Ethnic, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Black mustard seeds
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/3 c  Lemon juice
3 tb Coarsely chopped coriander
1/4 c  Shredded coconut
1 c  Basmati white rice
2 c  Water
1 ts Salt
3 tb Ghee
1/2 c  Raw cashew pieces
1/2 tb Yellow split peas
Wash rice.  Bring water to a boil.  Stir in rice, salt & 1/2 tb ghee. Cover
with a tight-fitting lid.  Reduce heat to very low & gently simmer, no
peeking, for 20 to 25 minutes.  The rice should be light & fluffy & the
water should be absorbed.

Set side, leaving covered.

Heat the remaining ghee in a small pot over a moderate heat till hot. Drop
in the cashews & stir fry till golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon &
pour over rice.  Cover the rice again.

Raise the heat slightly & toss in the split peas & mustard seeds (you can
omit the peas) & fry till the seeds turn grey & sputter.

Pour the fried seeds into the rice & sprinkle with turmeric, lemon &
coriander.  Gently fold till well mixed.

Garnish each serving with coconut.

For a variation, substitute lime juice for lemon juice.
