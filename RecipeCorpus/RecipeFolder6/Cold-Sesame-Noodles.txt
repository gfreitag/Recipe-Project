---------------------------------GARNISHES---------------------------------
- thinly sliced
Sesame seasoning salt
-(gomasio)
1 lg Cucumber; peeled, seeded,
- and diced
1    Scallion; (green part only)
Bring about 6 cups of water to the boil.  Blanch the snow peas in the water
for 1 minute.  Remove them with a slotted spoon, place in a strainer, and
refresh immediately under cold running water. Cut into thirds and set
aside.

In the same boiling water used for the snow peas, cook the pasta until
tender but still chewy.  Drain well and reserve about 1/2 cup of the
cooking water.

In a serving bowl, immediately toss the hot pasta in the sesame oil to
prevent it from clumping together.

In a blender or food processor, combine the remaining ingredients, starting
with 1-1/2 tablespoons tamari and 1/4 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns, with
just enough of the pasta cooking liquid to create a medium-thick sauce (the
consistency should be like pancake batter).

Toss the sauce and reserved snow peas with the pasta.  Taste and add more
tamari and pepper if desired.

Garnish with the cucumber and scallion, and sprinkle with sesame seasoning
salt before serving.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
