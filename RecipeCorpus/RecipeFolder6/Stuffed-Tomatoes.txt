tomatoes carefully. Toast bread and cut into 1" cubes. Pour 2 tsp anchovy
oil (from can) onto bread, mash anchovies and mix with bread cubes and
inside of tomatoes. Add lots of parmesan cheese (approx 1/4 cup) to prevent
mixture from getting too wet and soaking up too moisture from inside of
tomatoes). Stuff tomatoes with mixture. Sprinkle parmesan on top. Put in
