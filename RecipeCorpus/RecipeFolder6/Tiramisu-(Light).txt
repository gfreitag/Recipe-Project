2. Combine hot water and expresso granules. Split ladyfingers in half
lengthwise. Quickly dip 20 ladyfinger halves, cut side down, in expresso (
which you've mixed in a small bowl). Place, dipped side down, into the
bottom of a 9" square baking dish. Dip 20 more halves cut side down into
the expresso; arrange dipped side down on top of the first layer. Spread 2
cups of the cheese mixture over the lady- fingers evenly; repeat procedure

cocoa.
