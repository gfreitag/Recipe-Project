Title: Soynog
Categories: Beverages, Low-cal, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
--(liquid or granules)
1/8 c  -to
1/4 c  Almonds
1/4    Nutmeg
1 ts Carob powder (optional)
1 pn Tumeric (optional)
1 c  Soy milk
1 tb Soy milk powder
1/4 ts Vanilla
1 ts Corn oil
--(or canola oil or
--flax seed oil)
1 ts Lecithin
Grind the almonds first in the blender dry.  Add the rest of the
ingredients and in a blender until light and fluffy. Can be served cold or
hot (do NOT boil!).  For variation sprinkle the top with some anise seed
and/or coriander, or, orange or lemon rind gratings, or, powdered cardamom.
If your soy milk is not very sweet, then add a little honey to the above.
If you can't find soy milk powder, then try thickening the soynog with,
say, with 1/2 to one fresh banana. If you want that slippery taste of
"real" eggnog then just add more oil, but I think is better to simply allow
your taste preferences to adapt and come to enjoy this soynog on its own
terms   :-)
