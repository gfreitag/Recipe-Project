Title: Tofu Whip
Categories: Sauces, Desserts, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Vanilla
1 tb Water, or more, optional
1 lb Firm or extra-firm tofu
- drained & cut into chunks
1/4 c  Maple syrup
It's light, fast, and a perfect complement to pies, puddings, and fruit
compotes.  Tofu Whip can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week; if
the mixture separates, blend it thoroughly before using.  The recipe may be
cut in half.

In a food processor or blender, blend all of the ingredients until very
creamy, adding water if needed to achieve a whipped cream consistency.
Refrigerate until needed.

VARIATION: Instead of maple syrup, try 3 to 4 tablespoons of
fruit-sweetened preserves and some finely minced citrus peel.  Choose the
fruit and citrus flavors to complement the dessert.

Makes about 2 cups
