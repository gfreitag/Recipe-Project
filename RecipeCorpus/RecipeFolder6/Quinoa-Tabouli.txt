Title: Quinoa Tabouli
Categories: Rice/grains, Mideast, Spices/etc., Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/3 c  Safflower oil
2 tb Fresh mint
Salt; to taste
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Quinoa
3 md Ripe tomatoes
1 c  Parsley
1 c  Scallions
Note:  The author says that 1 tsp. dried mint could be used, but dried mint
is nasty stuff, IMHO!

Pour water into a 1-quart saucepan.  Add quinoa; bring to a boil.  Reduce
heat to a simmer; cover.  Cook for 10 to 15 min., or until all water has
been absorbed.

While the quinoa is cooking, finely chop the tomatoes, parsley, and
scallions.  Add lemon juice, oil, and mint to tomato mixture.  Stir in
cooked quinoa and salt.  Mix well.

Let tabouli sit in the refrigerator for a day to blend flavors.

Note:  Also, she neglected to mention that tabouli is traditionally served
at room temperature.

The recipe was from Linda Najjar of Seattle, Washington, and the "Herb
Companion" note on it said:  "Substituting quinoa for the traditional
bulgur wheat gives this tabouli a lighter, fluffier, and slightly nutty
taste and enables people allergic to wheat to experience the flavorful joys
of this Middle Eastern dish."

(The Herb Companion, June/July 1993)
