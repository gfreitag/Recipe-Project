Cecila came up with this combination for actress Darryl Hannah, a
vegetarian who cooks for meat eaters.  The Philippines-inspired cold tomato
and lime dressing is compatible with grilled fish or chicken as well as
mushrooms.  To prevent the bamboo skewers from splintering in the heat of
the fire, soak them in cold water for about half an hour and place them in
the freezer for a few minutes before cooking.

Combine all marinade ingredients in a glass or ceramic bowl.  Add the
mushrooms, toss to coat and set aside to marinate for 1 hour at room
temperature.
