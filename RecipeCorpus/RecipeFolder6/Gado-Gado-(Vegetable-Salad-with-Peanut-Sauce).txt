Steam or parboil the carrots & potato slices for 5 minutes. Then cook the
cabbage, bean sprouts & cucumber for 1-2 minutes. Drain the vegetables and
leave them to cool. If using tofu, heat 1 Tbsp oil in wok or pan & cook it
for 3-5 minutes, turning from time to time until it is golden all over. Now
arrange the steamed vegetables in layers on fat platter, potatoes, then
bean sprouts, carrots & cucumber. Put the tomatoes and tofu on top. For the
sauce, heat the oil in a wok or large pan. Stir fry the garlic, onion, and
chili for 2-3 minutes. Add the peanut butter, lemon juice or vinegar and
coconut milk and simmer for 2-3 minutes. The sauce should be thick but
pourable so add more lemon juice/coconut milk if necessary. To serve, pour
the hot sauce over the vegetables and garnish with scallion, onion slices.
