Title: Roasted Eggplant with Chilies
Categories: Ethnic, Vegetarian, Chili
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Red chili peppers
1 tb Hungarian sweet paprika
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
1/2 c  Chopped coriander
2 lb Eggplant
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 c  Onion, finely chopped
1 c  Tomatoes, chopped
1/2 c  Finely shredded ginger
Grill or broil whole eggplants until they collapse.   When cool enough to
handle, slit them open & scoop out the flesh into a skillet with the oil.
Add the onion & cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes.  Stir frequently to
prevent scorching.

Add all the reemaining ingredients excepting the coriander.  Cook, stirring
often for 10 to 15 minutes.  Take care not to let it burn.  Stir in the
coriander & serve.
