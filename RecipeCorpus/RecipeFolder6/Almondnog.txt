Title: Almondnog
Categories: Beverages, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
-- more if desired
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Almond milk
- (See SOYNOG recipe)
2    Bananas (not over-ripe)
Blend the above until smooth, then sprinkle a little nutmeg on top. Serve
immediately as banana changes flavour when it sits after blending, so don't
try to keep in the refrigerator.
