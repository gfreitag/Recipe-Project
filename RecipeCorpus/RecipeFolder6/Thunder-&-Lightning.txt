Categories: Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Basil
1 tb Parsley
Olive oil for drizzling
8 oz Dry chick peas, soaked
1 lb Elbow macaroni
2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
2 tb Olive oil
Drain & wash chick peas.  Cook for 50 to 60 minutes, or until tender.

Meanwhile, cook the macaroni in a large pan of boiling water, lightly
salted for 10 minutes, or until just resistant to the bite.  Drain.

Saute garlic in a large skillet in olive oil for a few minutes.  Add
cooked, drained chick peas & macaroni.  Mix in the basil & parsley.  Cook
over a very low heat, stirring occasionally, til the flavours are absorbed
& the mixture is heated through.  Season with salt & pepper & serve hot
with a crisp green salad.
