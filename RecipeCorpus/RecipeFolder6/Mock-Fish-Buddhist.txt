Wood ears are a type of mushroom or shelf fungus. When soaked it has a
crunchy, gelatinous texture with little taste. If you can't find them, I
imagine that you could use the dried mushrooms although they wouldn't give
exactly the same effect. A closer substitute would be dried jellyfish, but
if you're some- where that sells dried jellyfish, I'm sure that they have
wood ears as well...
