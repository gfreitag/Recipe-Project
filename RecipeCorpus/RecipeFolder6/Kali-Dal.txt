hours.  Add the onions, ginger, tomatoes, 1 cup water, cardamom, coriander,
pepper, salt & 6 tb ghee.  Mix well, bring to a boil & simmer for 4 1/2 to

Return to the pot.  Keep the dal on a low simmer.

Pour over the dal & mix in the coriander.  Simmer till heated through.

Serve with Royal Vegetable & Rice Casserole.
