Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
--------------------------FORMATTED BY S.GRABOWSKI--------------------------
1 1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Diced turnips
4 c  Millet
6 c  Water
Wash millet and drain with a fine mesh strainer until water comes clean.
Place millet in a heavy pot and add cooking water. Let soak 4-8 hours or
overnight before cooking.

Add salt and diced turnips. Bring to a boil, place heat deflector under the
pot, then simmer over low flame for 45-50 minutes. For a creamier texture,
allow millet to sit in the pot 10 minutes before uncovering. Mash with a
potato masher; if necessary, add a cup of water while mashing to make a
mashed potato consistency. Transfer to a serving bowl and cover. Serve with
an ice cream scoop and top with gravy.
