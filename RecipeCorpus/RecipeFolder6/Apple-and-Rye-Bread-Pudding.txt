1 tb Sunflower butter ->OR<-
Tahini
1 c  Water
2 tb Mellow or sweet miso
2 c  Amazake beverage (original)
->OR<-
Vanilla soy milk
5 1/2 c  Cubed fresh or stale

Bread
1/2 c  Raisins
1 tb Caraway seeds ->OR<-
Anise seeds
5 c  Diced apples
1/2 c  Apple bitter
Cube bread and toss in a large bowl with raisins and caraway seeds. Stale
bread may be used instead of fresh. Toss apples in a bolw with bread cubes.

Combine apple and sunflower butter (or tahini), 1 cup water, miso, amazake
or soy milk, then pour liquid mixture over apples and bread. Stir to coat.
Spoon mixture into a lightly oiled 2-quart casserole dish or two 9-inch pie
plates or cake pans. Cover with lid (oven-proof).

Allow mixture to sit for 2 to 4 hours before baking so bread will soak up
flavors. Bake covered at 350F for 1 hour or until slightly firm and mixture
pulls away from sides slightly. Then remove from oven and spoon into
individual dessert cups. An ice cream scooper works well. Allow to cool
slightly and then serve.
