Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Cayenne
1/8 ts Asafetida
1/2 ts Turmeric
1 tb Ground almonds
1/2 tb Lemon juice
5 tb Ghee
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 lb Fresh okra, washed & dried
2 tb Whole coriander seeds,

1 tb Whole cumin seeds
- coarsely crushed
2 ts Fennel seeds
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 tb Garam masala
Slice the stems off the okra & the very tip at the other end.  Slit each
pod lengthwise, leaving 1/4-inch unslit at both ends.  Be careful not to
cut the pods completely in half.

Combine the crushed coriander, cumin & fennel seeds with the balck pepper,
garam masala, cayenne, asafetida, almonds, lemon juice & 2 tb of ghee.
Blend well, using your fingers if necessary till you have a dry oatmeal
type texture.

Using a butter knife, put about a 1/4 ts of the stuffing into each okra
pod, then press the edges closed & set aside covered till you are ready to
cook.

Place the rest of the ghee in a large skillet & heat till hot.  Add the
stuffed okra pods & spread out in one layer.  Keeping the heat moderate,
cook for 5 minutes, covered.  Gently turn the okra to ensure even cooking.
Continue this for 20 to 25 minutes or until the okra is completely cooked.

Place the okra on paper towels & toss with salt.  Serve piping hot.
