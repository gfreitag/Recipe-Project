Title: Scrambled Tofu
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
- mashed or crumbled
1/2 ts Dried leaf oregano
1/4 ts Tumeric (optional)
1/4 c  Finely chopped green olives
-(pitted)
1    Sheet nori sea vegetable
- finely shredded (optional)
Tamari or soy sauce
- to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
Hot sauce (optional)
1 tb Olive or canola oil
1 lg Onion
- peeled & coarsely chopped
2 lg Garlic cloves
- peeled & finely chopped
6    Scallions; thinly sliced,
- (keep white & green parts
-  separate)
1/4 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
1 sm Red bell pepper
- seeded and diced
1 lb Silken or soft tofu; drained
Great for brunch or a light supper dish, this recipe can easily be doubled
to serve 4 to 6.  Silken tofu results in a very soft-cooked texture, while
soft tofu will be slightly firmer.

NOTE: Tumeric will give a faint yellow color to the mixture, but will not
contribute significantly to the taste.

DIRECTIONS: In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil and saute the onion,
garlic, and white of scallions until the onions turn light brown, about 4
to 5 minutes.

Add the mushrooms, red pepper, tofu, oregano, and tumeric (if using), and
continue to saute over medium-high heat for another 3 minutes, stirring
frequently.  Stir in the scallion greens, olives, nori (if using), soy
sauce and pepper to taste.  Pass optional hot sauce.
