Pick over, wash, and drain the mung beans.  Wash and drain the rice.  Wash
the spinach well and separate the leaves.  Peel the onion, cut in half
lengthwise, and slice into fine half-rounds. Put the mung beans in a heavy
4-quart pot.  Add water and bring to a boil over a medium-high flame.
Cover, lower heat, and simmer two mintes.  Turn off the heat and let the
pot sit, covered, for an hour.  Bring the water to a boil again. Add the
rice and the ginger and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn heat to low, and
cook gently for one hour.  Stir occasionally during this period. Now add
the spinach and salt.  Bring to a simmer. Cover and cook gently for 1/2
hour, stirring now and then to avoid sticking. Add a little hot water if
the porridge seems too thick. Heat the ghi in a #5 skillet over a medium
flame.  When hot, put in the hing. Two seconds later, put in the whole
cumin seeds.  Five seconds later, put in the onion. Stir and fry until the
onion begins to turn brown at the edges. Add the ground cumin, coriander,
and cayenne.  Stir and fry for one minute. Empty the contents of the
skillet into the rice and bean pot. Stir. Cover and cook for five more
minutes.  Discard the ginger. Sprinkle with pepper. Serve in individual
bowls with some or all of the garnishes.
