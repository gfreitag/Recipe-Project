Title: Braised Spicy Eggplant
Categories: Vegetables, Oriental
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Dried chile bean sauce, -OR-
1    -dried red chile
1 tb Bean sauce
1 tb Granulated sugar
1 1/3 c  Water
2 ts Chopped scallions (optional)
1 lb Eggplants,
2 ts Salt
1 tb Oil
1 tb Finely chopped garlic
1 tb Finely chopped ginger root
2 tb Finely chopped scallions
2 tb Dark soy sauce
ROLL-CUT THE CHINESE EGGPLANTS or, if using the regular large variety, trim
and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Sprinkle the cubes with salt and leave in a
sieve to drain for 20 minutes, then rinse under cold running water and pat
them dry with paper towels. Heat a wok or large skillet to a moderate heat.
Add the oil and let it heat up for a few seconds, then add the eggplant,
garlic, ginger and scallions and stir-fry for 1 minute, until they are
thoroughly mixed together. Now add the rest of the ingredients except for
the scallions. Turn the heat down and cook, uncovered, for 10 to 15
minutes, until the eggplant is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the
heat to high and continue to stir until the liquid has been reduced and has
thickened slightly. Turn the mixture onto a serving dish and garnish with
the chopped scallion tops.
