Title: Love in Disguise
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Wine vinegar
French mustard
15 oz Canned tomatoes
A little stock
2 oz Butter
1 oz Well-seasoned flour
Few spoonfuls yoghurt (opt.)
2 lb Pigs' hearts
1 sm Onion
4 oz Fresh breadcrumbs
Bay leaves
Parsley
2    Lemons (zest only)
1    Egg; beaten with milk
2 tb Milk; to beat with egg
You may get 2 or 3 large hearts for this weight or several smaller ones.
Whatever the size, they will be slashed; this is normal.  Wash the hearts
and trim away waste - fat, membrane, gristle and arteries.  Soak in lightly
salted water for 10 minutes then rinse, drain and dry well.  Chop the onion
finely and soften it in 1 oz butter.  Away from the heat stir in the
breadcrumbs, lemon zest, 4 tablespoons parsley and lots of salt and pepper.
Bind with the egg and milk.  Use the mixture to stuff the heart cavities,
and secure the openings with toothpicks or cocktail sticks - there is no
need to make perfect closures.

Whizz the tomatoes in a blender, stir in the vinegar and add enough stock
to make up to 1 pint.  Dust the hearts thoroughly with the well-seasoned
flour.  Melt 1 oz butter in a flameproof casserole, stir in the leftover
flour and let it brown a little.  Blend in the tomato mixture and make a
smooth, bubbling hot sauce.  Lay the prepared hearts in the sauce and tuck
the bay leaves among them.  Cover with greaseproof paper and the lid, and
cook at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for 1 hour.  Turn the hearts gently and
continue cooking for 1 to 1-1/2 hours more until meat is beautifully
tender.

Transfer the hearts to a warmed serving dish.  Stir the mustard into the
sauce, add salt and pepper to taste - and carefully blend in the yoghurt if
liked.  Pour the sauce over the hearts, scatter lavishly with chopped
parsley and serve with boiled potatoes or noodles.
