"Peanuts - which are really a legume not nuts -came originally from Brazil
but today they are cultivated around the world and especially in Africa and
the United States."
To begin with, heat the oil in a saucepan & cook the onion until it
becomes transparent. Add the ground peanuts or peanut butter, potatoes and
a little stock and mash well. Alternatively, put these ingredients into a
blender.
Now pour the rest of the stock slowly into the puree, mixing well.
Bring the soup to a boil, then let it simmer, covered, for 5-10 minutes.
after this, remove the pot from the heat and season. Stir in the cream
before serving (if desired), sprinkling the chives on top.
