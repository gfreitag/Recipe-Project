~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Butter the baking dish, pie pan, or springform pan until generously coated.
Sprinkle the crumbs as needed into the pan, then turn the pan around and
shake gently, distributing the crumbs along the sides as well. The crumbs
should completely coat the inside of the pan.  Chill briefly to set the
crumbs and then fill with the desired filling. CAKE: Preheat the oven to
325 degrees F.  Sift together the flour and baking powder and set aside.
Press the cottage cheese through a sieve.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the
eggs and the sugar until they are frothy.  Add the spices and fruit rinds.
Add the cottage cheese and blend all the ingredients well. Stir in the
butter, then add the dry mixture, mixing well. Pour the mixture into the
prepared crust and bake for 1 hour. NOTE: Again this is more like a quick
bread, and you can increase the sugar if you like as this is not
particularly sweet.
