SAUCE:  In a heavy saucepan cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over
low heat, stirring, for 2 minutes, add the parsley, the basil, the
tomatoes, the tomato paste, the stock, the wine, the sugar, the romano, the
salt and the oregano, and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, for 30
minutes. MEATBALLS:  In a bowl combine well the bread, squeezed, the chuck,
the eggs, the romano, the parsley, the garlic, the oregano, the salt, and
the pepper and form the mixture into 10 meatballs. In a large skillet brown
the meatballs in the oil over high heat, turning them often. Transfer the
meatballs to the sauce with a slotted spoon and simmer the mixture,
stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. The dish improves in flavour if it
is cooled and chilled, covered, overnight or up to 2 days.
