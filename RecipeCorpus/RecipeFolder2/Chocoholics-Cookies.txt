Categories: Cookies
Yield: 50 servings
3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/4 ts Salt
6 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate
8 oz Pecan Halves
8 oz Walnut Halves
6 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate, melted
4 oz Unsweetened Chocolate
12 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate
3 oz Unsalted Butter
3 oz Margarine
1 1/2 tb Instant Espresso
4 ea Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sugar
4 tb Vanilla
in oven until toasted, 10 to 12 minutes or until they develop a toasty
aroma.  Remove from oven and set aside to cool.  Increase oven temperature
to 350 degrees.  Place unsweetened chocolate, 12 oz semi-sweet chocolate,
butter, margarine and espresso in top of double boiler and place over
simmering (not boiling) water until chocolate is about 3/4 melted.
Meanwhile, beat the eggs with a wire whisk in a large mixing bowl.
Gradually add sugar, whisking until mixture becomes thick and light in
color.  When chocolate is almost melted, remove from heat and stir until
completely melted and satiny in appearance.  Gradually whisk chocolate
into egg mixture.  Stir with a wooden spoon to incorporate.  Sift flour,
baking powder and salt directly into chocolate mixture.  Gently stir until
the dry ingredients are barely incorporated.  Cut the 6 oz of semi-sweet
chocolate into 1/2 inch chunks and stir into dough along with the toasted
nuts.  Lightly butter 4 aluminum baking sheets.  (do not use foil or
cookies will burn)  Drop dough by tablespoonfuls, 12 to a sheet to leave
room for cookies to spread.  Bake only one sheet at a time in center of
oven.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies lose
their shine.  Cookies will still be very soft.  Allow to cool for 2
minutes before removing from pans.  Using a pin-sized tip on an icing bag,
pipe melted semi-sweet chocolate onto cookies in a criss-cross pattern.
Allow to cool at least 1 hour before storing in tins.
Makes 50 one-ounce cookies
