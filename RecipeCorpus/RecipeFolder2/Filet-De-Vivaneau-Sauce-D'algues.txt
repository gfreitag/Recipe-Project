Categories: Fish/sea, Sauces
Yield: 4 servings
2/3 lb Fresh Seaweed
1 1/2 qt Water
1 x  Salt
1 x  Ground White Pepper
2 tb Cornstarch (optional)
1/4 c  Skim Milk (optional)
4 ea 3/4 in. Red Snapper fillets
1 tb Olive Oil
2 ea Medium Carrots, chopped
1 ea Small Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Minced Fresh Mushrooms
2 lb Fish scraps
1 ea Lobster head
1 ea Bouquet Garni
* Fish scraps: Heads and bones of red snapper, turbot, sole or halibut.
** Bouquet garni - a leek tied with parsley, whole cloves, thyme, a bay
leaf and whole peppercorns.
Heat oil in heavy pot, add carrots, onions and mushrooms and cook over
medium heat for 2 minutes.
Add fish scraps, lobster head, bouquet garni, seaweed and water and simmer
very slowly for 2 hours skimming off any scum that forms on the surface.
Strain fish stock through a fine sieve or a strainer lined with a tea
towel. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
If desired, blend cornstarch and milk together and stir into stock. Cook
gently until the sauce is thickened. Blend smooth in blender or food
processor.
When ready to cook fish, preheat broiler to hot and have rack 4 inched
from heat. Oil grill and broil fish for about 4 minutes, then turn and
continue broiling for 8 - 10 minutes or until fish flakes with a fork.
Season with salt and pepper, serve with hot sauce.
You may bake fillets in a heavy pan instead. Spread with some seaweed,
arrange fish on top, pour 1 cup of sauce over seaweed, cover and bake at
450 degrees for 8 - 10 minutes. Or, you can steam the fish. Arrange as in
baking, steam for about 8 minutes.
Christian Leveque, chef-proprietor of Restaurant Champs Elysees made this
low-fat sauce for grilled red snapper with a fish stock he seasoned with
seaweed.
