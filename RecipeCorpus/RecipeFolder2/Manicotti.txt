stir in the remaining ingredients for the Meat Filling.  Fill the uncooked
manicotti shells, packing the filling into both ends.  Place the shells in
an ungreased baking pan, 13 X 9 X 2-inches.  Heat the oven to 375 degrees

Tomato sauce except the Parmesan Cheese to boiling, stirring occasionally.
Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 5 minutes.  Pour the
sauce over the filled shells.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake
until the shells are tender, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours.  Sprinkle with the
cheese and cool 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
