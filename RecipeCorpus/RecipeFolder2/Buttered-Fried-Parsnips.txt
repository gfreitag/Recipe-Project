Title: Buttered Fried Parsnips
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 x  Salt & Pepper; To Taste
1 tb Parsley; Chopped
2 lb Parsnips
4 tb Butter
1/8 ts Nutmeg
Wash, trim and scrape the parsnips.  Cut into uniform pieces and boil in
salted water, 25 to 30 minutes or until tender.  Drain well, and let dry.
Just before serving, heat the butter in a skillet and saute over moderate
heat until light brown on all sides, letting the parsnips caramelize a
little in their own sugar.  Season with the nutmeg, salt and pepper and
serve in a warm vegetable dish, garnished with parsley.
