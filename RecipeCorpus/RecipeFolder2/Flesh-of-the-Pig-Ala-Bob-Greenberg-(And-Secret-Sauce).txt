1 ea Open Pit small bottle
1/4 c  Molasses
Regular old supermarket pork. Spare ribs, country ribs, or any other pork
Not too much fat. Cut off any gross excess, and cut them to EVEN thickness.
You'll ruin everything if you cook the meat unevenly. You may compensate by
scoring the meat. In a large baking pan, soak the ribs with cider vinegar,
after which sprinkle them with garlic salt and finely ground black pepper.
(Don't use pepper mills, or other peppers.) It doesn't seem to matter how
long the ribs soak, or how much vinegar is on them. Just make sure it hits
all sides, you don't have to puncture them. This sweetens the meat. The key
to the fire is the hickory chips. Keep feeding these amazing little fellows
to the charcoal. The flavor comes out of these chips and you cannot do
without them. Make sure the fat and chips don't light up your whole dinner
and ruin it. Cooking: A moderate hot fire a couple of inches or more from
the meat, and a grill of reasonable cleanness. As the meat cooks turn it
often, do not let it burn, do not baste it with anything. Don't cover the
grill and don't stray too far -- fire is always hiding in the wings. Here
is the catch -- the trick -- the hard part, is the timing. You may ruin
some meals before you hit it, but the time to take them off the grill is
one minute after trichina danger is past. As soon as the meat turns brown
it's time to eat. You can use the small strips you cut off to judge just
when things are perfect. Special Purpose Sauce: (don't eat it cold, it's
awful) 1 bottle Open Pit, One bottle A-1 Sauce, 1/4 C of molasses. Start
re-heating the sauce until slow boil, dump in the cold pork from the
fridge. alt. without sauce wrap the meat in foil and heat at 325 oven for
15-20 minutes. Sauce can be stored and re-used, but remember it will have
pork fat in it now.
