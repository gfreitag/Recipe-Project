Heat 3/4-inch of water to boiling in 10-inch skillet; carefully place fish
in water.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, uncovered, just until
fish is opaque, about 30 seconds (DO NOT overcook or fish will fall apart);
drain carefully.  Mix remaining ingredients except tomato and avocado in a
glass or plastic dish. Stir in fish carefully. Cover and refrigerate 2 day,
carefully stirring occasionally. Just before serving, gently stir in tomato
and avocado; drain. Serve fish mixture on saltine crackers or tortilla
chips, if desired.
