Title: Phipps Famous Shortbread
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 48 servings
1 lb Butter, soft
1 c  Sifted rice flour
2 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose
1 c  Fruit sugar
1/2 lb Belgian chocolate
Spread the all-purpose flour on a cookie sheet and place under a pre-heated
broiler about 4-5 inches from the element.  Roast the flour, watching it
all the time until it is medium brown.  Turn the flour with a spatula to
brown the other side.  The entire procedure takes about three minutes and
gives the flour a rich nutty flavour. Let the flour cool.
Mix the soft butter with the fruit sugar and add the sifted rice flour.
Fold in the roasted flour and blend well.  Chop the chocolate into chunks
just a little smaller than a sugar cube. Mix them into the dough, taking
care you don't soften the chocolate too much. Shape as desired. Bake at
300F for 1 hour.  Cool, then store in an airtight container. Yield depends
upon size and shape.
