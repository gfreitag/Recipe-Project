Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set
aside.  Cream together the butter and sugar in a bowl until light and
fluffy, using an electric mixer set at medium speed.  Add eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla. Add dry
ingredients alternately with water to creamed mixture, beating well after
each addition.  Stir in sauerkraut. Spread batter in greased 13 x 9 x
2-inch bakeing pan.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 35 minutes
or until cake tests done. Cool in pan on rack. Frost with Creamy Chocolate
Frosting.  Cut into squares. CREAMY CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Melt chocolate in a
custard cup in hot water. Cool slightly. Combine chocolate, cream cheese,
milk, confectioners' sugar, salt, and vanilla in a bowl. Beat with an
electric mixer at high speed until smooth and creamy. NOTE: This is one of
those dishes that sound absolutely horrible, but tastes great. It is also
one of those recipes that is a classic but you can never find in most
cookbooks.  I have fooled my kids with this as well as seen it done on TV.
Everyone thinks that the sauerkraut is coconut. So be sure to rinse and
drain the sauerkraut several times when you make this recipe.
