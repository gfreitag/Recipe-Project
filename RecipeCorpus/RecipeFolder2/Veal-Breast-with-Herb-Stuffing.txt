Stuffing: To prepare stuffing, dice bacon and onion.  Cook bacon in a

chop mushrooms, add to frypan and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove
mixture from heat, let cool and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Add herbs,
ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, and sour cream. Mix thoroughly. Season
with salt and pepper. Veal: With a sharp knife, cut a pocket in the veal
breast or leg.  Fill with stuffing; close opening with toothpicks. (Tie
with string if necessary.) Rub outside with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a
Dutch oven.  Place meat in the pan and bake in a preheated 350 degree F.
oven about 1 1/2 hours. Bast occasionally with beef broth. When done, place
meat on a preheated platter. Pour rest of beef broth into the Dutch oven
and scrape brown particles from the bottom. Bring pan drippings to a
simmer. Thoroughly blend cornstarch with sour cream and add to pan
drippings while stirring cook and stir until thick and bubbly. Slice veal
breast and serve sauce separately.
