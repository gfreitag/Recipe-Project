Mix meat and salt.  Shape mixture into 4 patties, each about 3/4 of an inch
thick.  Press pepper into both sides of the patties.  Cook the patties in a
large skillet over medium-high heat, turning once, until the desired
doneness is reached, about 8 minutes.  Drain off the fat. Sprinkle the
cognac over the patties, immediately ignite, if desired. Remove patties to
a warm platter.  Stir the wine into the drippings in the skillet. Heat just
to boiling, stirring constantly.  Serve sauce over the patties.
