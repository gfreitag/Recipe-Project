Put the metal blade chopping in your food procesor, then place the onion,
lemon juice, mayonnaise, chili peppers and salt in the work bowl. Run the
processor nonstop for 10 seconds.  The onion should be minced, and the
other ingredients blended together. Use a tablespoon to scoop out large
chunks of avocado into the work bowl. Clean out each avocado shell as
thoroughly as possible.  Distribute the chunks of avocado around the
chopping blade of the food processor.  Pulse process two or three times,
until the mixture is churned, but lumpy (like cottage cheese).
