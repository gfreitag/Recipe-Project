Prepare basic meatballs except -- cook in a Dutch oven.  Drain off excess
fat.  Add the remaining ingredients and heat to boiling.  Reduce the heat,
cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender,
about 40 minutes.  Remove the bay leaf and serve. NOTE: You can substitute
1 24-oz package of frozen stew vegetables for stew for the carrots, celery
and potatoes.
