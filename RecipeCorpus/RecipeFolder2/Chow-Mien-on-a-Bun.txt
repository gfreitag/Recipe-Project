Cook and stir the meat and onion in a large skillet until the onion is
tender.  Drain off the excess fat.  Mix the water, cornstarch, soy sauce,
molasses and ginger and stir into the meat mixture.  Add the bean sprouts
and water chestnuts.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens
and boils, about 5 minutes.  Serve on the toasted buns and pass the soy
sauce. NOTE: For Chow Mien omit the buns. Serve the chow mien mixture over
hot cooked rice or chow mien noodles.
