Title: Pork Chops with Crust of Onions
Categories: Pork/ham
Yield: 4 servings
1 x  Thyme (fresh or dried)
2/3 c  Dry White Wine
2/3 c  Chicken Stock
2/3 c  Fresh homemade Bread Crumbs
2/3 c  Freshly Grated Parmesan
4 ea Large center-cut Pork Chops
1 x  Salt
1 x  Freshly Ground White Pepper
5 1/2 tb Butter
2 ts Chopped Fresh Tarragon
4 c  Chopped Onions
* You can use 1 teaspoon of dried tarragon instead of 2 teaspoons of fresh
tarragon. The pork chops should have the bone in and weigh about 10 oz
each.
** Your doctor will have a sh*t-fit if he/she knows about the butter.
Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper.
Melt 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter in a large heavy frying pan over
medium-high heat and brown chops on both sides, turning frequently so they
do not stick.
Remove from pan, sprinkle with tarragon, cover and keep warm.
Add another tablespoon of butter to the pan drippings and saute onions for
3 minutes or until soft and golden.
Spread 2/3 of the onions in the bottom of a shallow casserole, arrange
chops, tarragon-side down on top. Sprinkle lightly with thyme and cover
with onions.
Pour wine into pan, bring to a boil, add chicken stock, return to the boil
and cook until liquid is reduced to about 2/3 of a cup. Pour mixture over
chops.
Combine bread crumbs and cheese, spread over onions and chops. Melt
remaining 2 tablespoons butter and drizzle it over the crumbs. Bake at 400
degrees for 30 minutes. Serves 4.
