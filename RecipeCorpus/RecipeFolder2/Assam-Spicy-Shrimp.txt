Categories: Fish/sea, Oriental
Yield: 6 servings
1 x  ---------marinating---------    1 1/2 c  Water
1 tb Oyster sauce
6 oz Tamarind
3 oz Young ginger root
1 ts Blachan
3 tb Oyster sauce
1 tb Hot chili sauce
1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
2 lb Headless shrimp
1/2 ts Hot chili sauce
1 x  ----------cooking-----------
4 ea Large garlic cloves
2 ea Small red onions
1 tb Dark soya sauce
3 tb Oil
MARINATING:  Break tamarind apart, place in a small saucepan with water.
Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes or until pasty coating separates from
seeds.  Press through a sieve or food mill to extract all pulp and soupy
liquid.  Discard seeds.  Rinse shrimps thoroughly, pat dry and marinate fro
1 hour with 1 tablespoon of this tamarind liquid, the oyster sauce and hot
chili sauce. COOKING:  Meanwhile, cut young ginger into toothpick-sized
slivers.  If using mature ginger, peel and sliver. Peel and sliver garlic.
Place blachan in a non-stick pan and heat gently fro 3 to 4 minutes to
develop the flavors. Pell and cut red onions into wedges. Combine oyster,
soy and chili sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind liquid.
Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop of water sizzles immediately
into steam pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Swirl up sides of wok, and
when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and garlic. Stir fry until
golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding more oil as needed, stir frey shrimp
in batches until orange red, about 3 minutes. Pour sauces over all the
shrimp in the wok and cook at a brisk bubble over high heat until shrimps
are aromatic and sauces have reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells,
about 8 minutes.  Mix in sugar and onion wedges, taste to adjust seasoning,
sweetening and spiciness. Makes plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice,
enough for 8 with other dishes.
