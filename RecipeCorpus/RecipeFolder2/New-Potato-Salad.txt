2 lb Potatoes; new (approximatel
5 ea Green onions; finely choppe
A local restaurant serves a simple, but elegant, potato salad as part of
their Sunday Brunch menu.  This is my own attempt at duplicating it. Stir
the chopped green onions into the Dill Cream Dressing.  Add salt and pepper
to taste.  You may also want to add more lemon juice or Dijon mustard at
this point, as this produces a fairly bland dressing. Slice potatoes (leave
skins on) about 1/4 inch thick. Place in a large bowl and fold in the
dressing.  Serve chilled.  Best made the day before so the flavors have a
chance to mingle. Source:  Sallie Austin
