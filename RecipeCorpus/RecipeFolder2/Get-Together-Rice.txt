1/3 lb Honey Roast Ham
2 ts Soy Sauce
1 ts Sugar

1 ea Egg
1 x  Salt
1/2 c  Uncooked Rice

Fill a saucepan with water and add the rice. Bring the water to a boil and
let the rice boil freely for 9 minutes or until it is cooked through.
Drain and stir in the 2 tablespoons of corn oil.
While rice is cooking, wash and cut all of the vegetables and ham into
very small diced pieces. Mix the soy sauce and sugar together.
Heat a wok or frying pan and add the peanut oil. When it is smoking, add
the onions and stir fry for 1 minute. Add the scallions and continue to

Crack the egg and drop it into the hole, beating to mix the yellow and

together and continue to fry another 3 - 4 minutes.
Taste for seasoning. Add salt if necessary.
