Preheat oven to 375 deg F.
Heat the oil in large skillet. Add the onion, celery, and garlic and
saute over low heat until the onion is translucent. Add the green pepper
and continue to saute until the onion is golden.
In the meantime, stem the eggplants and cut them in half lengthwise.
With a sharp knife, score each half several times lengthwise and across,
carefully removing the pulp. Leave a sturdy shell of about 1/4" all
around.
Chop the eggplant pulp and add it to the skillet mixture along with all
the remaining ingredients except the bread crumbs. Add a bit of water,
just enough to keep the mixture moist. Simmer, covered, over low heat
until the eggplant is tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the bread
crumbs.
Set the eggplant shells in an oiled shallow baking dish, which should be
of a size that they can be securely propped up against each other. Stuff
them, then bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the shells are tender but not
collapsed.
