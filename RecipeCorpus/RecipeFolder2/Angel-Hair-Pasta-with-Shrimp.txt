Categories: Pasta, Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 tb Flour
1/2 c  35 per cent cream
1 1/2 tb Chopped parsley
2 tb Grated paresan cheese
1/2 ts White pepper
2/3 lb Capellini
1/4 lb Snow peas, trimmed
1 1/2 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 1/2 tb Pesto sauce
1 tb Minced garlic
1/2 ts Salt
1 x  Worcestershire and tabasco
1/2 ea Red pepper, cut in strips
1 lb Jumbo shrimp
In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter, stir in flour and cook for a
few minutes until golden.  Add milk and cream, bring to a gentle simmer and
continue to stir until thickened.  Add pesto, parsley, garlic, parmesan,
salt, pepper, worcestershire and tabasco, and stir until blended. Reduce
heat and keep warm, stirring occasionally. Cook pasta quickly in a large
pot of boiling water (3 to 4 minutes, or until al dente). At the same time,
poach the pepper, snowpeas and shrimp in another pot of boiling water ( 2
or 3 minutes, or until just heated through). Drain the pasta, mix it with
the sauce and portion it into heated individual serving bowls. Garnish each
portion with shrimp and vegetables, and serve immediately.
