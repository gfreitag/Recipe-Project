Title: Burgundy Style Beef
Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 servings
1 x  Salt and pepper to taste
2 ea Garlic cloves
1 ea Bay leaf
2 ea Strips lemon peel
4 tb Oil
2 tb Flour
6 oz Mushrooms
2 lb Round steak
3 ea Onions
1/8 ts Thyme
1 ts Parsley
1 1/4 c  Burgundy
3 ea Slices bacon
2/3 c  Beef stock
Cut  the meat into neat,  fairly large cubes and put into a  dish. Add salt
and  pepper to taste.   Peel and slice the onions and garlic
very thinly, sprinkle 1/3 of the onions and the garlic over the meat, and
add the  thyme,  bay leaf,  and parsley.   Add the lemon peel and wine with
about 1/4 of the oil.   Leave the meat to marinate for at least 2 hours,
turning occasionally. Cut  any rind from the bacon and dice it. Heat the
remaining oil in  a heavy pan and gently fry the rest of the onions and the
bacon until just golden. Lift  the meat from the marinade with a perforated
spoon or  strain  the liquid from the meat, retaining the liquid. Toss the
meat in the flour then fry for several minutes with the bacon and onions.
Strain the wine marinade into the pan, stir well to blend, add the beef
stock  with a little more salt and pepper, bring to a boil, lower the heat
and cover the pan tightly. Simmer gently for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours until the
meat is very  tender, adding the mushrooms in the last 5-10 minutes.
