Cut meat into 2 inch cubes.  Dice the bacon.  Skin and
crush the garlic, using the tip of a firm knife, in a
pinch of salt on the chopping board, or  use a garlic
press;   blend with the chopped  parsley,  cloves,
and allspice. Put  the meat into a dish,  and add the
wine vinegar,  wine,  and garlic spice  mixture.
Peel  and  thinly slice one third of  the  onions
and carrots,  add to the marinade with a little salt
and pepper.   Leave for at least 12 hours turning
occasionally. Peel the remaining onions and carrots,
quarter the onions but leave the carrots  whole.
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet,  fry the
diced bacon  and  quartered  onions  until golden
brown,  and  spoon  into  a casserole.
Remove  the meat from the marinade,  drain well.
Brown meat in the oil remaining  in the pan and add
to the onions.   Pour the marinade  liquid and
vegetables into the skillet and stir well to absorb
the last of  the oil.  Add the whole carrots, brandy,
and herbs. Cut  the zest from the orange and squeeze a
little orange juice and  add this and the zest to the
sauce.  Season the sauce with a little salt and
pepper.  Pour over the meat and onions, cover the
casserole. Cook  in  the  center of a slow (350 d F)
for 2 1/4  hours.   To  serve, remove  the  garni.
This dish is particularly good  when  served  with
spaghetti, macaroni, or noodles, topped with butter,
grated cheese and a little chopped parsley.
