+----------------------*** MAPLE YOGURT SAUCE
***------------------------- * A large, firm, tart
apple is best. Use Ida Red or Northern Spy. A Cortland
can be used. However, if you use a McIntosh, you must
shorten the cooking time.
Core apples and remove top inch of peel. Make a
shallow out through skin around centre of each apple
to prevent skin from bursting. Place apples upright in
baking dish or pie plate. In a small bowl, combine
brown sugar, raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spoon into
centres of each apple. Add water to cover bottom of
dish. Bake, uncovered in 375 F for 25 to 30 minutes
for less firm apples and up to 50 minutes for firm
varieties or until apples are tender when pierced with
a toothpick.
Combine the yogurt and maple syrup to make the sauce.
Pour over the baked apples.
