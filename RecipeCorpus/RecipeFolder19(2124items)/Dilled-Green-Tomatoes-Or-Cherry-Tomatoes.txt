Pack the tomatoes into sterilized jars and to each
quart jar add 1 clove peeled garlic, 1 stalk celery,
several strips of green pepper and a large spray of
dill. Bring to a boil 2 quarts of water, 1 quart
vinegar, and 1/2 cup pickling salt and boil for 5
minutes.  Pour the hot brine over the vegetables in
the jar and seal.  The pickles will be ready to us in
about 4 weeks.  Hot red pepper, celery seed and
