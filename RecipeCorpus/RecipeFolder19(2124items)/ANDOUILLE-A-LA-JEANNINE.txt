1 c  Dry white wine
2 T  Honey
Slice andouille 1/4-to 1/2-inch thick.  Mix all liquid
ingredients and pour over andouille in a covered
skillet.  Cook over low heat until andouille is tender.
Andouille is gumbo sausage for all you peoples who
live away from the center of the universe.  You can
use other sausage and it would taste okay.
