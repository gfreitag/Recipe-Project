BREAD PUDDING:
Break bread into ovenproof dish (1-1/2 quart at
least).  Soften bread with small amount of milk.  Beat
sugar and egg yolks.  Add milk, stir well.  Add
vanilla and salt.  Pour milk mixture over bread.  Fold
in raisins if used.  Cut butter into chunks and fold
in.  Place dish in pan of water and bake at 300
degrees for 40-50 minutes, or until a silver knife
inserted comes out clean.  Make meringue adding 2
level tablespoons sugar to each egg white. Spread, and
return to 350 degree oven until brown (browning in a
slow oven prevents falling).  Serve warm WHISKEY SAUCE:
Cook until dissolved.  Remove from heat, add whiskey
to individual taste.
From "Talk About Good"  Submitted by Mrs. Henry
Gauthier, Sr. I haven't tried this one, but it sure
looks good.  It is quite different, what with the
meringue, than that served up at Prejeans.
