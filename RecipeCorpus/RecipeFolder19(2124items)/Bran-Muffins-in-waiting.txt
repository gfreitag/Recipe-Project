Title: Bran Muffins-in-waiting
Categories: Muffins Breads Breakfast
Servings:  2
1 c  Warm Water
3 1/2 c  Wheat/Oat Bran Cereal
2 1/2 c  Unbleached All-purpose Flour
2 1/2 t  Baking Soda
1/2 c  Butter/Margarine, Room Temp.
1 1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
2 ea Large Eggs
2 c  Butter/Sour milk.
I use Whole wheat pastry flour for the unbleached
flour and I also add 3 Tablespoons of Wheat germ.
*sour milk is 1 cup milk 1 Tablespoon vinegar as a
general rule   2 cups butter/sour milk = 1 3/4 c milk
+ 2 Tablespoon vinegar + 1 stick   butter melted (has
worked well for me).
