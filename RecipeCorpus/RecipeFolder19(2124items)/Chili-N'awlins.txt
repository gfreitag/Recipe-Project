I had this when visiting friends in N'awlins.  He
didn't know the source of the recipe, but this was
sure passable chili. In a large, heavy pot, brown the
meat with the onions and the garlic. Drain off the fat
and stir in the chili powder (depending on quality,
you may want more - we get real cool stuff up here in
the north). Add chilies, tomatoes, tomato paste, bay
leaves, salt, oregano, vinegar, and brown sugar.
Cover the pot and cook for 2 hours over low heat.
Add beans and cook, uncovered, 30 minutes more.
Serve with side dishes of corn chips, shredded
lettuce, and shredded Cheddar cheese.
