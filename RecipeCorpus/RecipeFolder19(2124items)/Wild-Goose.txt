and 2 apples, both quartered. Place breast side up in

all fat from pan and discard. Remove bacon.
Add to the pan 1 onion, quartered, 1 carrot,
quartered, 1 cut up stalk of celery, 1 bay leaf, 2 or
3 sprigs of parsley, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 2 cans
consomme with 2 cans water, and 1 cup of dry red wine.
Cover the pan and roast at 375 degrees for 2 to 2-1/2
hours, basting often. Goose should be done so that
meat will readily pull off carcass. Remove goose from
roaster and place on warm platter. Remove and discard
stuffing. Strain the gravy and thicken with 1

water.  Correct seasoning if necessary. Serve with
wild rice. Mrs. Nicholas J. Constantine
