Categories: Indian Main dish Spicy Entertain Ethnic
Servings:  4
1/4 c  unsalted cashews
3 ea dried hot red chilies
2 ea in piece of stick cinnamon
1 ea 1 in cube fresh ginger
1/4 t  cardamom seeds
3 ea whole cloves
2 ea large garlic cloves peeled
2 T  poppy seed (white)
1 T  coriander seeds
1 t  cumin seeds
1/2 t  saffron threads
6 T  ghee (or melted butter)
1 c  chopped onion
2 t  salt
1/2 c  unflavored yoghurt
1 1/2 lb lamb cut into 2" cubes
2 T  finely chopped coriander
1 T  lemon juice
1/4 c  boiling water
1 c  cold water
To make the masala,  combine the cashews,  chilies,
ginger and the  cold water  and  blend  at  high speed
for  1  minutes.   Add  the  cinnamon, cardamom,
cloves, garlic, poppy seeds, coriander seeds and
cumin.  Blend again until the mixture is completely
pulverized.  Set the masala aside. Place  the saffron
in a small bowl,  pour in boiling water and let  soak
for at least 10 minutes. In  a  heavy skillet heat the
ghee over moderate heat until  a  drop  of water
flicked into it sputters instantly.   Add the onions
and, stirring constantly,  fry for 7 or 8 minutes,
until soft and golden brown.  Stir in   the  salt
and  the  masala,   then  add  the  yoghurt.
Stirring occasionally,  cook over moderate heat
until the ghee lightly films  the surface.
Add  the lamb,  turning it about with a spoon to coat
the pieces evenly. Squeeze the saffron between your
fingers,  thin stir it and its  soaking liquid  into
the skillet.   Reduce the heat to low,  cover tightly,
and cook  for  20 minutes,  turning the lamb cubes
over from time  to  time. Scatter  1/2 of the fresh
coriander over the lamb and continue  cooking, tightly
covered for 10 minutes more, or until the lamb is
tender. To  serve,  transfer  the  entire contents of
the skillet  to  a  heated platter,  and  sprinkle the
top with lemon juice and the remaining fresh coriander.
