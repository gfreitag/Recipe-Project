Hold red pepper over a flame, turning it until evenly
charred.  Or cut it in half, rub with oil, and place
under the broiler until blackened.  Wrap in a plastic
bag and set aside to cool.  Scrape off the burned skin
and remove seeds and stem.  In bowl of blender or food
processor fitted with a steel blade, place red pepper,
vinegar, and garlic. Process until pepper is pureed.
With machine running, slowly drizzle in olive oil
until fully combined.  Stir in chives and season with
salt and pepper to taste. This recipe, featured at
Neiman-Marcus, is from caterer George Dolese.  George
serves this dressing over a salad of fusili pasta,
chunks of fresh mozzarella, julienned zucchini and
prosciutto, sliced smoked chicken, and blanched
asparagus.
