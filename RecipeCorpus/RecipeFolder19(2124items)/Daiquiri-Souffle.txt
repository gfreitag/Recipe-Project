Title: Daiquiri Souffle
Categories: Desserts
Servings:  4
1/2 c  Cold water
1 T  Unflavoured gelatin
4 ea Large eggs, separated
3/4 c  Sugar
1 ea Rind of lemon and lime
2 T  Lime juice
2 T  Lemon juice
4 T  Light rum
1 c  Whipped cream
Put water in a pan.  Sprinkle gelatin on top; let
stand at least 5 minutes.  Beat egg yolks and sugar
together until pale and fluffy.  Add lime and lemon
rind; mix to blend.  Cook gelatin mixture over low
heat until dissolved.  Add egg yolk mixture; cook
gently, stirring constantly, 3 to 5 minutes.  Don't
let mixture boil or it may curdle.  Remove from heat;
stir in rum, lemon and lime juices.  Cool until just
beginning to gel.  This can be hastened by setting
bowl on bed of ice.  Stir occasionally to prevent
jelly forming.  Whisk cream in bowl until soft peaks
form.  Fold whipped cream and beaten egg whites into
gelatin mixture.  Pour into prepared dish.  Chill.
Decorate with whipped cream, violets, and lime slices.
