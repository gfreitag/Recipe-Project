2 ea Egg Whites; Large
1 c  Sugar
1 T  ;Water
2 T  Maraschino Cherry Juice
1 T  Light Corn Syrup
1/4 t  Cream Of Tartar
10 ea Maraschino Cherries; Chopped
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together sugar,
butter and shortening.  Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Add flour and Fresca
alternately.  Add baking powder and when mixture is
fully creamed, add vanilla and fruit rinds.  Pour into
greased and floured 9 X 13-inch Cake Pan.  Bake 1 hour
or until cake tester comes out clean. FROSTING:
Mix all ingredients except cherries and beat
constantly while heating in the top of a double
boiler.  When thoroughly mixed, thick, and spreadable,
frost cake.  Decorate top of cake with chopped
maraschino cherries. NOTE:
Since Fresca is available only in limited areas if at
all, 7-up may be a good substitution, or any
lemon-lime drink.  Also, since the problem with the
cherries has been resolved with a different food
coloring, you may use the new ones or use gum drops
instead for the garnish.  Syrup from a can of dark
cherries might be substituted for the Maraschino
cherry syrup.
