++++++++++++++++++ Divide the pastry almost in half
and roll out the larger half on a lightly floured
surface to a 13-inch circle.  Line a 9-inch pie tin
with the pastry.  Trim the edge to 1/2-inch beyond the
rim of the pie tin.  Combine the apples, 1 cup of
apple cider and the sugar in a 3-quart saucepan and
cook, over high heat, until the mixture comes to a
boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 8 minutes
or until the apples are tender.  Drain the apples,
reserving the syrup.  Add enough additional apple
cider to the syrup to make 1 1/3 cups.  Return the
syrup and apples to the saucepan. Combine the
cornstarch and water in a small bowl and stir until
well blended.  Stir the cornstarch mixture and the
cinnamon into the apple mixture.  Cook over medium
heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to
a boil.  Remove from the heat and stir in the butter,
then pour the mixture into the pastry lined pie tin.
Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle.
Fold the pastry gently, so as not to tear it, into
quarters and cut slits in the folds.  Gently unfold
the pastry on to the top of the filling and trim the
edge to 1-inch beyond the rim of the pie tin.  Fold
the top crust under the lower crust and form a ridge
by fluting the edge of the pie.  Bake in a 400 degree
F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm before
cutting and serving. NOTE:
This is the perfect pie to serve with the rich cheddar
sauce in this file.
