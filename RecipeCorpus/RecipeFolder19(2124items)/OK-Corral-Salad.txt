This pasta salad gets its name from the shape of the
pasta, but you could just as easily use shells and
rename it Seashell Salad, etc.  Toss all the
ingredients in a large salad bowl and chill. The salad
can be made the night before and refrigerated. If you
want to take it easy, just slice all the veggies with
a food processor. BASIC DRESSING
