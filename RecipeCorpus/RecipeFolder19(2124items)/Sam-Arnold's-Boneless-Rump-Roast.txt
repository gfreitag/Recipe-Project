NOTE:  This recipe is adjustable to all sizes of
roasts.  This is the Marinate the meat for a couple of
hours in a liquid that is slightly acidic--a liquid
such as wine, beer, vinegar, or lemon juice.  Roast
for 15 minutes per pound at 325 degrees F.  For the
last 15 minutes, cook at 500 degrees F.  For example,
for a 4 pound roast, total cooking time is 1 hour but
it will be 45 minutes at 325 degrees F. and 15 minutes
at 500 degrees F.  This will crust the outside of the
roast and the inside will be medium, barely pink.
This is based on room temperature meat.  If the meat
is quite cold, extend the baking time.  After 3/4 of
the cooking time, sprinkle with salt and some fresh or
dry rosemary needles.  Turn the roast with WOODEN
SPOONS (Very important that you do not pierce the
meat) and season it all over.  Rosemary, seasoned salt
or garlic salt are nice, and some freshly ground black
pepper adds to the flavor also.  Swab the roast with
some fresh lemon juice--this will also add to the zing
of the meat.  When cooked, snip off the cords and
slice to serve.  From the roasting pan, spoon off the
fat from the accumulated juice.  Add some beef stock
or red wine to the juices, a few minced shallots or
green onion shreds and cook down at high heat to a
reduction or concentrated sauce. Adjust the
seasonings, salt, pepper, and herbs of your choice,
and serve with the roast.
