-------------------------MEATBALLS-------------------------
2 ea Slices bread, soaked
1 lb Ground chuck
2 ea Large eggs, beaten lightly
1/2 c  Freshly grated romano
1 ea Clove garlic, minced
3 T  Minced parsley
1 t  Dried oregano

SAUCE:  In a heavy saucepan cook the onion and the
garlic in the oil over low heat, stirring, for 2
minutes, add the parsley, the basil, the tomatoes, the
tomato paste, the stock, the wine, the sugar, the
romano, the salt and the oregano, and simmer the
sauce, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
MEATBALLS:  In a bowl combine well the bread,
squeezed, the chuck, the eggs, the romano, the
parsley, the garlic, the oregano, the salt, and the
pepper and form the mixture into 10 meatballs.  In a
large skillet brown the meatballs in the oil over high
heat, turning them often.  Transfer the meatballs to
the sauce with a slotted spoon and simmer the mixture,
stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.  The dish
improves in flavour if it is cooled and chilled,
covered, overnight or up to 2 days.
