Title: Chocolate Pecan Pralines - Prudhomme
Categories: Cajun Candies
Servings: 24
1 1/2 ea Sticks unsalted butter
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Packed, light brown sugar
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
2 c  Whole pecan halves
2 T  Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
NOTE: Chocolate chips should be chilled.
Assemble all the ingredients and utensils before
starting to cook. (Measure out the chocolate chips and
keep them refregerated until just before needed.)  You
will need a large, heavy-bottomed aluminum pot or
skillet with deep sides, a long-handled metal whisk or
spoon, 2 large spoons (or an ice cream scoop with a
manual release) and a very lightly greased cookie
sheet.    Melt the butter in the pot over high heat;
add the sugars, milk, cream and chopped pecans.  cook
5 minutes, whisking constantly.  reduce heat to
medium, and continue cooking and whisking 10 minutes.
Add the pecan halves and continue whisking and
cooking until done, about 8 to 10 minutes.  (If the
mixture smokes excessively toward end of cooking time,
lower thge heat.)  Stir in vanilla.  then immediately
drop about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into about
one-sixth of the batter.  Stir quickly and just enough
to cover some of the chips with batter but not nenough
to allow the chips to melt.  Quickly drop the
chocolate mixture onto the cookie sheet by heaping
spoonfuls, using the second spoon to push the batter
off the first (or use ice cream scoop); each praline
should be about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch
thick.  repeat with remaining mixture, stirring
briefly before adding more chocolate chips.  The
cooled pralines should be light brown, opaque,
somewhat chunky and crumbly. LAGNIAPPE:  To clean the
pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with the
utensils in it.  This will melt the batter off. From
