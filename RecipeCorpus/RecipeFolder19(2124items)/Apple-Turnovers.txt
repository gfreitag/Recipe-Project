Categories: Cheese Fruits Pies
Servings:  6
2 1/4 c  Unbleached Flour
1/4 t  Salt
2/3 c  Vegetable Shortening
6 oz Cheddar; Sharp, Shredded
1 x  Water
3/4 c  Brown Sugar; Firmly Packed
1 t  Cinnamon; Ground
6 ea Apples; Pared And Cored
1/4 c  Butter
Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Combine the flour and
salt, mixing well, then cut in the shortening until
the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sir in the
cheese and sprinkle with water while mixing lightly
with a fork, (From 6 to 8 Tbls of water maybe
required), continue mixing until dough makes a ball.
Divide the dough into three equal portions and roll
each portion, on a lightly flour surface, into a 14 X
7-inch rectangle.  Cut each rectangle into 2 7-inch
squares.  Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon, then
fill the centers of the apples topping each apple with
butter.  Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar mixture
over the pastry. Place an apple in each square and
fold the corners to the center, pinching the dough at
the top of the apple to seal.  Bake in the preheated
oven for 30 to 35 minutes.  Top with whipped cream.
