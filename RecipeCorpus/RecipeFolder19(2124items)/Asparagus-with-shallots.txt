Snap off tough ends of asparagus.  If asparagus is
thick, old or tough, peel bottoms.  Add asparagus to
pan of boiling salted water.  Boil gently until
cooked--bright green and tender--but still firm, about
5 to 8 minutes.  Remove; drain on towel; put on
platter and drizzle with oil, lifting spears to coat.
Sprinkle with shallots and parsley.  Salt slightly.
