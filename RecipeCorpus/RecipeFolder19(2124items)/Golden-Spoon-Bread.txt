very gradually, stirring constantly.  Stir until the
mixture thickens and becomes smooth. Remove the top of
the double boiler from the simmering water and
gradually add the beaten egg yolks, stirring
constantly.  Mix in the grated cheese, butter, sugar
and salt.  Beat the egg whites, in a small bowl, until
round peaks are formed.  Gently spread the beaten egg
whites over  the corn meal mixture then carefully fold
together until just blended.  Turn the mixture into
the greased casserole dish.  Bake at 375 degrees F.
for 35 to 40 minutes or until a wooden pick or cake
tester comes out clean when inserted in the center of
the dish.  Serve piping hot with butter and maple
syrup or honey.
