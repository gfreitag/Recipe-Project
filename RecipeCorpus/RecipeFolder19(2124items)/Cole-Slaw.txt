Put mayonnaise and mustard in a bowl large enough to
hold complete mixture, but shaped so that the mixture
can be beaten with a fork.  Beat mayonnaise and
mustard until combined.  Add olive oil slowly, beating
all the time.  Beat until mixture has returned to the
thickness of original mayonnaise.  Add Louisiana hot
sauce, continuing to beat.  Add ketchup and keep
beating. Add salt and garlic salt, beating all the
time.  Add wine vinegar (this will thin the sauce
down).  Beat this thoroughly, adding the lemon juice
as you do so.  Taste for salt and pepper. Place
shredded cabbage, peppers, and onions in a large salad
bowl. pour sauce over and toss well.  This should be
done about an hour before serving.
Tastes even better the next day.
