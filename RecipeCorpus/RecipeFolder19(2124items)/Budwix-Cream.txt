*Budwix is a mixture of millet, almonds and flax seed.
You can use plain yogurt or Quark cheese instead of
cottage cheese. Other seasonal fruits can be used
instead of a banana. In a blender, grind the
grain-and-nut mixture until homogeneous but gritty.
Add oil, cottage cheese, lemon juice, honey and fruit
to the mixture in the blender. Blend until smooth and
serve immediately. From The Gazette, 91/02/20.
