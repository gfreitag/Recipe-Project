1 ea Dill cream dressing recipe
5 ea Green onions; finely choppe
1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
A local restaurant serves a simple, but elegant,
potato salad as part of their Sunday Brunch menu.
This is my own attempt at duplicating it. Stir the
chopped green onions into the Dill Cream Dressing.
Add salt and pepper to taste.  You may also want to
add more lemon juice or Dijon mustard at this point,
as this produces a fairly bland dressing.  Slice
potatoes (leave skins on) about 1/4 inch thick. Place
in a large bowl and fold in the dressing.  Serve
chilled.  Best made the day before so the flavors have
a chance to mingle. Source:  Sallie Austin
