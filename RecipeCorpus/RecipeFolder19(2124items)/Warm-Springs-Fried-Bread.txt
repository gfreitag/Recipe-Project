Title: Warm Springs Fried Bread
Categories: Breads Londontowne
Servings:  6
3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 T  Butter
2 t  Baking powder
3/4 c  (to 1c) Warm milk
1 t  Salt
2 T  Melted butter
1 t  Sugar
1 x  Fat for deep frying
Combine dry ingredients; cut in butter. Add enough
warm milk to make a soft dough, easy to handle. Knead
on floured board until dough is very smooth and soft
but elastic. Do not use a lot of extra flour. Divide
dough into 6-8 balls and brush the tops with melted
butter. Cover and let stand 30-45 minutes. Pat out
each ball into a round, 5 or 6 inches in diameter and
1/4 inch thick. Fry in deep fat (preheated to 365
degrees). Dough should rise immediately to surface.
Cook until brown on one side, turn, and brown on other
side being careful to not pierce crust. Drain on
absorbent paper and serve hot. Mrs. Bernard Mahon
