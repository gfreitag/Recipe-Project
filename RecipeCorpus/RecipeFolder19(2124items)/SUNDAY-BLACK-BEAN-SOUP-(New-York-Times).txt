saute carrots, onions, celery, and garlic until onions
are golden.  Add cumin and jalepenos. When beans are
ready to cook, add ham hocks to beans along with
sauted vegetables, and chicken broth and enough water
to cover.  Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until tender.
Drain the bean mixture and reserve cooking liquid.
Puree beans and vegetables.  Add sherry and lime
juice and enough of the reserved liquid to make a
thick soup. Can be served with chopped corriander or
sour cream or lemon slice.
