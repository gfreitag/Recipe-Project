Categories: Chicken
Servings:  4
4 ea Chicken breast
1 ea Garlic clove; quartered
1 x  ----marinade----
1/3 c  Lemon juice
1/3 c  Olive oil
1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
3 T  Oregano; fresh or 1 tbsp dr
1 x  ----basting ingredients----
5 T  Butter; melted
1/3 c  Lemon juice
3 T  Oregano; fresh or 1 tbsp dr
Several hours before serving-or the day before, if
time allows, rub the chicken pieces pieces with the
garlic and place them in a deep china or earthenware
bowl.  Combine marinade ingredients and the garlic
clove and pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and
refrigerate the chicken.  Turn chicken pieces
occasionally. When ready to cook, preheat the broiler
to its highest setting. Arrange the chicken pieces on
the broiler rack and baste with a little of the melted
butter mixture.  (Reserve part of the basting mixture
to serve over the chicken when served.)  Broil the
chicken 3-4 inches from the heat for 5-8 minutes per
side, basting often. Chicken is done when juices run
clear when pierced with a sharp knife.  Remove to
serving platter, pour reserved basting mixture over
the chicken breasts and serve immediately. This is
also good done on a BBQ.
