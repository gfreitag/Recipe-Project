CREAM--------------------------- Heat the oven to 375
degrees F.  Line a jelly roll pan, 15 1/2 X 10 1/2 X 1
inch with aluminum foil or waxed paper, grease
generously.  Beat the eggs in a small mixer bowl, on
high speed, until thick and lemon colored, about 5
minutes; pour into a larger mixer bowl.  Gradually
beat in the sugar.  Beat in the water and 1 tsp of
liqueur on low speed.  Gradually add the flour, 1/4
cup of cocoa, the baking powder and salt, beating just
until the batter is smooth.  Pour into the jelly roll
pan.  Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the center
comes out clean, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Immediately
loosen cake from the edges of the pan; invert on a
towel sprinkled generously with cocoa.  Carefully
remove the foil.  Trim off the stiff edges of cake if
necessary.  While hot, carefully roll the cake and
towel up, together, from the narrow end.  Cool on a
wire rack at least 30 minutes.  Unroll the cake;
remove the towel.  Sprinkle 2 tb of the liqueur over
the cake spread with Cinnamon Whipped Cream; roll up.
Sprinkle with cocoa, if desired and refrigerate until
serving time. CINNAMON WHIPPED CREAM:
Beat all of the ingredients in a chilled bowl until
stiff.
