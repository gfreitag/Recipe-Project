2 1/4 t  whole cumin
1 1/2 t  whole black mustard seeds
1 1/2 ea One inch stick cinnamon
6 ea Hole cloves
3/8 t  whole black peppercorns
3/8 t  ground nutmeg
1 1/2 ea Whole dried hot red chili
3 c  grated fresh coconut
1 1/2 ea One in cube ginger chopped
9 ea Cloves garlic
3/4 ea Fresh hod green chili
2 1/4 c  water
6 T  vegetable oil
3 ea Medium onions, minced
3 1/3 lb chicken parts, skinned
2 1/4 t  salt
Put the coriander seeds,  cumin seeds,  mustard seeds,
cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns,  nutmeg  and red chili
in a small frying pan.  Place over a medium  flame.
Now  quickly  'dry-roast'  the  spices,  stirring
them frequently until they emit a very pleasant
'roasted' aroma.  Empty  the spices  into  a  clean
coffee grinder or spice grinder and  grind  until
fine.  Put spiced in bowl. Put the coconut into the
same frying pan and dry roast it over a  medium flame,
stirring all the time.  The coconut should pick up
lots of brown flecks  and  also smell roasted.   Put
the coconut in the bowl with  the other dry roasted
spices. Put  the  garlic,  ginger,  and  green chili
into the  container  of  an electric blender, along
with some water.  Blend until you have a paste. Heat
the oil in a 10-12 inch frying pan or saute pan over a
medium  high flame.   When hot put in the onions.
Stir and fry them until they pick up  brown spots.
Now pour in the garlic-ginger mixture and stir
once. Turn  heat to medium.  Put in the chicken
pieces,  salt,  as well as the spice  coconut mixture
in the bowl.   Stir and fry the chicken  for  3-4
minutes  or until it loses its pinkness and turn heat
to low,  and  cook for  25  to  30 minutes or until
chicken is tender.   Stir a  few  times during this
cooking period, making sure that you turn over each
piece of chicken so that it gets evenly colored.
