Title: GARLIC SAUCE
Categories: Sauces Appetizers
Servings:  1
1 ea Large head of garlic
10 ea Slices white bread
1 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  White vinegar
1 T  Lemon juice
3 T  Water
Peel and crush the garlic, the entire head.  Remove
the crusts from the white bread, and place the
crustless bread in a mixing bowl.  Add the garlic
along with the olive oil and vinegar. Let this soften
for 1 hour. Beat with an electric mixer until all is
smooth. Don't do this with a food processor as it will
be too smooth.  Add lemon juice, slowly add water
while the mixer is running so you will have a thick
and fluffy sauce.
