Title: Italian Sausage in Tomato Sauce
Categories: Cajun Appetizers
Servings: 10
2 lb Italian Sausage
2 T  Olive oil
2 c  Tomato sauce
1 t  Oregano
1 c  Chablis wine
1 lb Mushrooms, fresh and sliced
Saute Italian sausage for a few minutes in olive oil -
just long enough to seal it or firm it up.  Remove
sausage and let cool. Cut into bite-size pieces.  Mix
the rest of the ingredients in the skillet.  Bring to
a boil.  Add sausage and cook for 1 hour on low heat.
Serve as a hot appetizer.
You may wish to be cautious with the wine at first.
Some may find 1 cup too much.
