Categories: Beef Marinade Main dish Entertain
Servings:  4
2 lb round steak
1 x  salt and pepper to taste
3 ea onions
2 ea garlic cloves
1/8 t  thyme
1 ea bay leaf
1 t  parsley
2 ea strips lemon peel
1 1/4 c  burgundy
4 T  oil
3 ea slices bacon
2 T  flour
2/3 c  beef stock
6 oz mushrooms
Cut  the meat into neat,  fairly large cubes and put
into a  dish.   Add salt  and  pepper to taste.   Peel
and slice the onions and garlic  very thinly, sprinkle
1/3 of the onions and the garlic over the meat, and
add the  thyme,  bay leaf,  and parsley.   Add the
lemon peel and wine  with about 1/4 of the oil.
Leave the meat to marinate for at least 2 hours,
turning occasionally. Cut  any rind from the bacon and
dice it.   Heat the remaining oil in  a heavy pan and
gently fry the rest of the onions and the bacon until
just golden.
Lift  the meat from the marinade with a perforated
spoon or  strain  the liquid from the meat,  retaining
the liquid.  Toss the meat in the flour then fry for
several minutes with the bacon and onions. Strain the
wine marinade into the pan,  stir well to blend, add
the beef stock  with a little more salt and pepper,
bring to a boil,  lower  the heat and cover the pan
tightly. Simmer  gently  for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours
until the meat is very  tender, adding the mushrooms
in the last 5-10 minutes.
