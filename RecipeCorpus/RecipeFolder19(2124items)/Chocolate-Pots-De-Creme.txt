SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE:  You'll find three
basic types of chocolate in the baking supplies
department of most supermarkets--semisweet chocolate,
unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate.  The
semisweet chocolate is made from chocolate that is
just slightly sweetened with sugar.  Unsweetened
chocolate is the original baking or cooking chocolate
and has no added flavorings or sugar.  And sweet
chocolate, such as the German cooking chocolate used
in the Chocolate Pots de Creme recipe, is chocolate
mixed with sugar and sometimes additional cocoa butter
or flavorings.
