Title: Cheddar Fans
Categories: Breads Cheese Quickbreads
Servings:  4
5 oz Cheddar; Sharp, Grated
2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted
1 t  Salt
1/2 c  Butter Or Shortening
1/2 c  Milk
1 x  Butter; Softened
1 x  Butter; Melted
1 tb Baking Powder
Grease the bottoms of 12 muffin pan cups.  Grate the
cheese into a bowl, if not already grated and set
aside.  Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a
bowl.  Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or
two knives, until the mixture resembles coarse corn
meal.  Make a well in the center of the mixture and
add the milk all at once.  Stir with a fork until the
dough forms a ball.  Gently form the dough into a ball
and put on a lightly floured surface.  Knead it
lightly with the fingertips 10 or 15 times.  Roll the
dough into a 12 X 10-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch
thick.  Cut into 5 strips and spread with the softened
butter.  Sprinkle four strips with the grated cheddar
cheese and stack the four on top of one another and
top with the fifth strip.  Cut into 12 equal pieces
and place on end in the muffin cups.  Brush the tops
of the rolls with the melted butter.  Bake at 450
degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes or until the biscuits
are golden brown.  Serve hot with butter. Makes 1
dozen Cheddar Fans.
