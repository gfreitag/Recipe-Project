Servings:  1
1 x  Unbleached Flour
1 x  Potato Water
Boil some potatoes for supper, save the potato water,
and use it lukewarm with enough unbleached flour to
make a thick batter. without yeast.  This is a good
way to make it in camp, where you have no yeast
available and want fast results.  This is also the way
most farm girls made it in the olden days.  Let stand
a day or so, or until it smells right.
