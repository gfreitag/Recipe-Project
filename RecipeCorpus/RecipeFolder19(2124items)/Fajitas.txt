Title: Fajitas
Categories: Mexican Main dish Poultry
Servings:  8
1 1/2 lb Boneless chicken breast
2 x  Garlic cloves
2 x  Jalapeno peppers
1/2 c  Olive Oil
1/3 c  Dry Sherry
1 T  Chili Powder
2 t  Ground cumin
Slice the chicken breast into long 1/2 inch wide
strips. To make a marinade, drop the garlic cloves and
jalapeno peppers through the feed tube of a food
processor with the chopping blade in place and the
motor running until chopped finely (10 seconds or so).
Add the remaining ingredients and process until
smooth (about another 10 seconds.) Pour the marinade
over the chicken and let marinate for 2 hours at room
temperature or overnight in the refrigerator, turning
occasionally. Preheat the oven broiler.
Drain the chicken, reserving the marinade.  Arrange
the chicken on a rack on a broiler tray and broil 3
inches from the heat source for 5 minutes; turn, baste
with marinade, and broil for another five minutes.
Serve with warmed tortillas, shredded lettuce,
shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes and salsa verde.
