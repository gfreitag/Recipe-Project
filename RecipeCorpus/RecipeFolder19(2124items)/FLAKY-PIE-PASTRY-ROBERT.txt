Title: FLAKY PIE PASTRY ROBERT
Categories: Pies Desserts
Servings:  1
1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 c  Crisco
3 tb Or 4, ice water
Blend flour and salt together in large mixing bowl.
Blend Crisco into flour mixture using pastry blender
until mixture resembles a combination of coarse meal
and peas. Add ice water one tablespoon at a time,
tossing mixture lightly with a fork to combine. When
mixture can be compressed easily with a fork, enough
ice water has been added. Form pastry mixture into a
flat disk and wrap tightly in plastic wrap or waxed
paper. Pastry may be refrigerated until ready for use.
Roll between two sheets of waxed paper to 1/8-inch
thickness. If pre-baking for non-baked filling, bake
at 425 degrees F. for 12 minutes. Yields one 9-inch
pie shell.
