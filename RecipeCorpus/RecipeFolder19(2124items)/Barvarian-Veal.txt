on top of each piece of veal.  Place an unsliced egg
on top of the bacon.  Rollup each slice of veal
(jelly-roll fashion) and tie together with string.
Heat oil in frypan and brown veal rolls well on all
sides.  Add onion; saute for 3 minutes.  Add the hot
bouillon; cover and simmer gently 25 minutes.  Remove
the veal from the pan.  Remove the strings from the
veal and keep veal warm on a serving platter.  Add
tomato paste to the pan drippings; stir.  Thoroughly
mix flour and red wine to remove all lumps.  Add to
sauce and cook until mixture thickens.  Add warm veal
rolls and heat through.  Before serving, place veal
rolls on a platter, pour sauce over the rolls and
serve with pureed potatoes.
