Title: Sour Cream Brittlebread
Categories: Cajun Appetizers Breads
Servings: 10
2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 t  Baking soda
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Sour cream
2 T  Creole seasoning
2 T  Kosher salt for sprinkling
Preheat the oven to 400F.  Sift together the flour,
sugar, salt, and baking soda into a bowl or food
processor.  Cut in the butter.  Add the sour cream and
Creole Seasoning (see recipe for Creole Seasoning),
and mix to a soft dough.  Roll out paper-thin on a
floured board.  Cut into 1-1/2 inch squares.  Sprinkle
with kosher salt and place on an ungreased baking
sheet.  Bake for 5-8 minutes.  Turn off the heat and
allow the bread to crisp in the oven.
Nathalie Dupree describes this recipe in her book "New
Southern Cooking" this way; "This crisp, cracker-like
bread is good just flavored with salt and sour cream.
But add Creole Seasoning and you'll have a hot and
spicy appetizer that will leave your guests begging
for the recipe.  It's nice to keep a big airtight
cookie jar full of these for snacking."
