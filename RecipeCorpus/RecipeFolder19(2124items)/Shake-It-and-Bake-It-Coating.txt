Title: Shake It and Bake It Coating
Categories: Poultry
Servings:  4
1 c  All-purpose flour
2 t  Salt
1 t  Pepper
1/2 c  Cracker crumbs
1 t  Paprika
1/2 t  Basil or Oregano, crushed
1/2 t  Powdered Thyme
1/2 t  Garlic powder
This mixture is sufficient to coat six pounds of
chicken. In a large jar, shake together the flour,
salt, pepper, crumbs, paprika, basil, thyme and garlic
powder until evenly mixed. Place mixture in a plastic
bag. If using only 3 pounds of chicken, place half of
the mixture in a tightly sealed jar and reserved for
later use. Moisten the chicken pieces with milk or
water. Place chicken pieces, one at a time, in the bag
and shake until evenly coated. Bake coated chicken
pieces in a greased shallow pan at 350 degrees F for
45 - 60 minutes. From The Gazette, 91/01/16
