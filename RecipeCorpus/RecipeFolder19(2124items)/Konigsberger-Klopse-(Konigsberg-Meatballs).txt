Meatballs:
Soak the roll in the water for about 10 minutes.
Squeeze it dry; place in mixing bowl with the ground
beef.  Add the bacon, anchovy fillets, onion, egg,
salt and pepper.  Mix thoroughly.  Prepare broth by
boiling the water, seasoned with salt, bay leaf,
onion, and peppercorns.  Shape the meat mixture into
balls about 2 inches in diameter.  Add to the boiling
broth and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.  Remove
meatballs with a slotted spoon, set aside, and keep
warm. Gravy:
To prepare gravy, heat butter in a frypan and stir in
flour.  Cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
Slowly blend in 2 cups of reserved broth. Add the
drained capers, lemon juice, and mustard.  Simmer for
5 minutes. Remove a small amount of the sauce to blend
with the egg yolk.  Stir egg yolk back into the sauce.
Season with salt and pepper. To Serve:
Place reserved meatballs into the gravy and reheat if
necessary.  Serve on a preheated platter.
