"... Ingredients in a marinade can be varied, but it
is important to use wine, vinegar, lemon juice, or
some acidic liquid to break down the connective
tissues.  This process will make the steak more
tender. Remaining marinade ingredients add flavor."
Use a good-quality olive oil or walnut oil; add
good-quality wine or vinegar and a combination of
fresh and dried herbs, seasonings, garlic and soy
sauce to make a flavorful marinade. 1.  Place all
ingredients in glass screw-top jar; shake vigorously.
Arrange meat in shallow glass dish; pierce with a
fork. Pour marinade over meat; turn to coat. Cover and
refrigerate several hours or overnight, turning meat
occasionally. 2.  Remove meat from marinade; pat dry.
Remove any pieces of spices or herbs that may stick to
meat. This recipe is a steak marinade, but the
ingredients can be adapted for other meats using the
same techniques.
