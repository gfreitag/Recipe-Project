++++++++++++++++++ CHEDDAR CRUST:
Combine the flour, cheese and salt in a bowl.  Using a
pastry blender or two knives, cut in the shortening
until coarse crumbs form.  Sprinkle the iced water (5
or 6 tbls will be needed) and using a fork, toss the
crumbs until a dough is formed.  Press the dough
firmly into a ball. FILLING:
Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the
larger half, on a lightly floured surface, to a
13-inch circle.  Line a 9-inch pie plate with the
pastry, trimming the edges to 1/2-inch beyond the rim
of the pie plate.  (Note:  When lining the pie plate,
be careful not to stretch the pastry when spreading it
out.  This will cause holes or the pastry will shrink
and the filling will run over in the oven as it is
baked.  Place in the pie plate and gently, working
from the center, spread the pastry out until it covers
the bottom of the pie plate and then lay the rest of
the pastry over the rim and trim.)  Combine the
apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl, mixing
well.  Arrange the apple mixture in the pastry lined
pie plate.  Roll out the remaining pastry to an
11-inch circle. Gently fold into quarters and cut
steam slits in the folds.  Unfold the crust and place
on top of the filling, trimming the crust to 1-inch
beyond the rim of the pie plate.  Fold the top crust
under the lower one and flute to form a ridge around
the edge of the pie plate.  Combine the egg yolk and
water, then brush the mixture over the top crust and
rim.  Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 45 to 50
minutes or until apples are tender and the crust is a
golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm
and serve with Vanilla Ice Cream, if desired.
