Title: Pappacito's Mango Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Servings:  2
1 ea 14 oz can, Mangoes
1/2 c  Orange Juice
4 ea Cloves of Garlic
1/4 t  Salt
2 tb Salad Oil
4 ea Chicken Breasts
1/2 c  Seasoned flour
2 t  Butter
2 tb Orange Liqueur
1 x  Toasted Almonds
Pound the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.
Reserve 8 perfect mango slices for garnish.
In a blender or food processor, whirl mangoes
(including syrup) with orange juice, garlic and salt.
Set aside. Heat oil in saute pan. When hot, dip
chicken breasts in seasoned flour -- be careful to
shake off excess flour -- and place them in the hot
pan. Saute chicken, for approximately 2 minutes per
side. Add butter and mango puree to the pan. Cook
until the sauce is reduced and fairly thick -- about 2
minutes. With a spatula, remove the mango-covered
chicken breasts from the pan and place them on a hot
platter. Spoon remaining mango puree over the chicken.
Sprinkle with toasted almonds. Garnish each breast
with 2 mango slices. For a more pronounced mango
flavour, use fresh mangoes. Use 2 fresh mangoes and
1/2 cup of orange juice. Boil for 1 minute. From
owner-chef Barry Pall of Pappacito's, a fast-food
restaurant in the Bell Canada Tower ind downtown
Montreal. He refused to identify the spices in the
seasoned flour but will admit that there are 2
teaspoons of powdered chicken soup per cup of flour.
