Title: Warm Bean and Tomato Salad with Basil
Categories: Salads

1/2 lb Green Beans, ends removed
3 tb Olive Oil
2 ea Large Dry Shallots, chopped
1 tb Balsamic or Red Wine Vinegar
1 c  Chickpeas, drained 19oz
2 ea Tomatoes, seeded, chopped

* You can use 1 teaspoon of dried basil instead of the
fresh stuff. Remove the ends from the beans and cut
into 1 12 inch lengths. Cook in boiling water until
just tender, about 5 - 7 minutes. Drain well.
Meanwhile heat one tablespoon of oil in a large frypan
over medium heat; cook the shallots until softened,
about 2 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar and cook until
liquid is reduced. Drain chickpeas and stir in
chickpeas and green beans; cook until heated through,
about 2 minutes. In a serving bowl, combine the bean
mixture with tomatoes, olives and basil. Whisk
together the remaining oil with lemon juice and pour
over salad; season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve warm or at room temperature. Serves 2 as main
course, 4 as side dish. From The Gazette, 91/03/06.
