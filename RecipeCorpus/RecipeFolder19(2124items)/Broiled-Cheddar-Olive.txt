Hard cook the eggs and slice them into a medium-sized

Prepare and add the olives, green pepper and onion.
Blend together the catsup, mayonnaise and prepared
mustard and the spices (blend them together in a small
cup or bowl).  Add the mixture to the cheese mixture
and set aside.  Set the oven to broil and split the
buns (if not already split) with a sharp knife.  Set
the buns on the broiler rack, cut sides up, and broil
with the buns 2 inches from the heat source until
golden brown.  Remove the buns from the oven and
spread with butter.  Spread about 1/8 of the cheddar
mixture on a buttered side of each bun and return to
the broiler with the tops of the sandwiches 3-inches
from the heat source.  Broil until the cheddar is
bubbly and serve right from the oven.
