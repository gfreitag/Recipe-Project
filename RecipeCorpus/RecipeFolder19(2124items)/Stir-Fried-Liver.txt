Title: Stir-Fried Liver
Categories: Meats Chinese
Servings:  4
1 lb Calves liver
1 x  Small onion
4 x  Mushrooms
4 x  Scallions
1 x  Clove garlic
1 t  Corn starch
2 T  Peanut oil
1 t  Soy sauce
Slice liver thin and mix with corn starch and crushed
garlic. Brown quickly in hot oil. Add finely-sliced
onions and mushrooms. Stir-fry until meat is evenly
browned, then add chopped scallions and soy sauce.
Continue cooking with constant stirring for 6 to 9
minutes. A tablespoon of brandy may be added to the
meat just before frying for that little touch of
luxury the Chinese lavish on honored guests.
