++++++++++++++++++ Sift together the flour, baking
soda and salt; set aside.  Combine sugar, eggs, and
oil in a mixing bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer set
at medium speed for 2 minutes.  Beat in the beets,
cooled chocolate, and vanilla. Gradually add dry
ingredients, beating well after each addition.  Pour
into greased 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan.  Bake in a
preheated 350 degree F. oven for 25 minutes or until
cake tests done.  Cool in pan on rack. Cover and let
stand overnight to improve flavor.  Sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar. NOTE:
This is similar to a recipe that I had from one of the
local cooking shows that was sent out to the listeners
when the Red food coloring was banned. While I have
not tried this recipe, I did make the other one and it
was good.  But the other recipe is long gone.
