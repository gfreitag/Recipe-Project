---------------------------SAUCE---------------------------

1/2 c  Sour Cream
Thoroughly mix ground meats, onion, bread crumbs, 3 T
cold water, and eggs.  Flavor with salt, praprika,
mustard, and parsley.  Blend ingredients thoroughly.
Flatten out meat mixture in the shape of a square, (8
X 8-inches).  Arrange whole hard-boiled eggs in a row
along the middle of the meat.  Fold sides of meat
pattie over the eggs.  Shape meat carefully into a
loaf resembling a flat bread loaf.  Occasionally rinse
hands in cold water to prevent sticking.  Cube 2
strips bacon; cook in a Dutch oven about 2 minutes.
Carefully add the vegetable oil; heat.  Place
meatloaf in the Dutch oven and cook until browned on
all sides.  Cut remaining bacon strips in half and
arrange over the top of the meatloaf. Place uncovered
Dutch oven in a preheated oven for about 45 minutes.
While meat is baking, gradually pour hot beef broth
over the top of the meatloaf; brush occasionally with
pan drippings.  When done remove meat to a preheated
platter and keep it warm.  Add 1/4 cup of hot water to
pan and scrape all particles from the bottom.  Bring
to a gentle boil and add cornstarch that has been
mixed with 1/4 cup water.  Cook until bubbly and
thick.  Remove from heat and stir in sour cream.
Reheat to warm.  Season with salt and pepper if
desired.  Serve the sauce separately.
