++++++++++++++++++ Combine 1 1/2 cups of the flour,
the sugar, undissolved yeast and salt thoroughly in a
large bowl.  Heat the milk and butter together until
very warm (115-125 degrees F.).  Gradually add to the
dry ingredients and beat at medium speed on an
electric mixer for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl
occasionally.  Add 1/2 cup of the flour and the
cheese.  Beat fir 2 minutes on high speed on the
mixer, scraping the bowl occasionally.  Stir in enough
additional flour to make a stiff but light dough.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes.  Place
in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.
Cover with a dishtowel that has been soaked in hot
water and then wrung out until almost dry.  Let rise
in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch the dough down and turn out on a lightly
floured surface and shape into a 20-inch rope.  Place
seam side down in a buttered 6 1/2 cup ring mold,
pinching the ends together.  Cover and let rise in
warm place until nearly doubled in bulk, about 35 to
40 minutes. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for
25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the ring mold.
NOTE:  For a softer crust, brush with melted butter
while still hot. Crust will become crisp when cool if
you do not.
