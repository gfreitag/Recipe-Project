Worcestershire sauce, and pepper together. Shape the
mixture into 6 patties, each about 3/4-inch thick.
Mix Parmesan cheese and cornflake crumbs.  Dip the
patties into the egg, then coat them with the
cornflake mixture.  Brown the patties in a large
skillet over medium heat, turning once.  Drain off the
excess fat.  Mix the tomato sauce and Italian
seasoning and pour over the patties in the skillet.
Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.  Top each patty with
a slice of cheese and cover.  Heat until the cheese is
melted, about 2 minutes.  Serve the leftover sauce
over the patties.
