Cover the apricots with the apple juice and bring to a
full boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, 30
minutes.  Stir the apricots occasionally so they will
not stick or burn.  Let the apricots cool, then
strain. Reserve the cooking liquid.  Chop the cooked
apricots and set aside.  In a 2-quart saucepan combine
the orange juice, honey, water, cornstarch, ginger and
cinnamon.  Heat, stirring constantly, until thickened
slightly. Remove the pan from the heat and add the
apricots, their cooking liquid and vermouth.  Serve
hot or well chilled. Each Tablespoon contains:
