Categories: Desserts Snacks
Servings: 48
18 oz PKG Devil's Food Cake Mix
2 ea Eggs
2 T  Water
2 T  Cooking Oil
1/2 c  Bitter Cocoa Powder
1 ea Envelope Unflavored Gelatin
1/4 c  Cold Water
1 c  Crisco
1 t  Vanilla
1 lb Plus 1 Cup Powdered Sugar
Blend all COOKIE DOUGH ingredients together until you
can shape the dough into a smooth ball.  Let it stand
20 minutes, loosely covered.  Form dough into
marble-sized balls.  Place 2 inches apart on greased
cookie sheet. Flatten each with smooth bottom of a
drinking glass greased once and dipped into Nestles'
Quick Powder. (Or use sweetened chocolate drink
powder).  Bake at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.  Remove
cookies at once from baking sheet, to paper toweling
and at once, flatten each cookie with back of pancake
turner.  Let cool 20 minutes.  Fill with COOKIE
FILLING mixture. (Cookie Filling)
Soften gelatin in cold water.  Place in heatproof cup
in pan of hot water till gelatin is transparent.
Meanwhile beat Crisco till fluffy, adding vanilla and
sugar a little at a time.  Beat in Gelatin mixture
when it is completely cooled, but not yet "set" or
firm.  This is used to give the filling stability - as
well as protein!  When cooled, shape filling into 1
inch balls.  Place between the two bottom sides of the
cooled cookies, pressing gently till filling has
spread to edge of cookies and rounded-out like the
originals. This is suppose to be a great imitation
version of the original Nabisco Oreos.
