++++++++++++++++++ Sprinkle the yeast over the warm
water and let stand 5 minutes.  Gently stir to
completely dissolve.  With an electric mixer, blend
the softened yeast into the cottage cheese, sugar,
salt and egg.  Add the flour in 1/2 cup portions to
form a stiff but light dough and let rise in a warm
place until doubled in bulk.  Butter a 1 1/2 quart
casserole dish and stir the dough down, then add 1 cup
of the grated cheddar cheese.  Turn into the buttered
dish.  Let rise 30 to 40 minutes longer or until
almost doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F. and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until
golden brown.  Brush the top with butter.
