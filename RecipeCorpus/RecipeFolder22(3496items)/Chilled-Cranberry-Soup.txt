Title: Chilled Cranberry Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 5 servings
2    Whole cloves
4    Black peppercorns
1 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Heavy cream
3/4 c  Dry red wine, or to taste
12 oz Fresh cranberries (1 bag)
3 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Sugar, approximately
2    Cinnamion sticks
2    Allspice berries
Pick the cranberries over for stems and rinse in cold water. Combine
the 3 cups of water, the sugar and the spices in a large saucepan and
bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and add the cranberries.  Gently
simmer the soup for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cranberies are
soft and the liquid is well flavored.  If necessary, add additional
sugar to taste.

Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water to make a paste.
Whisk this mixture into the soup and boil for 1 minute.  The soup
should thicken slightly.  Let the soup cool to room temperature, then
refrigerate until chilled.  The recipe can be prepared up to 48 hours
ahead up to this stage.

Just before serving, stir in the heavy cream and wine.  The spices
can be left in or removed before serving.  Serve the cold cranberry
soup in chilled glass bowls.  If you like, you can garnish each bowl
with a dollop of sour cream.

Makes 5 servings.
