Title: Apple Potato Salad
Categories: Fruit, Vegetable, Apples
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Dressing, No-Oil
1/4 ts Dill (optional)
4    Potatoes, new, small
4    Celery stalks
1    Apple, Delicious
Slice the potatoes into bitesize pieces and boil until tender, but not
soft.  Peel the apple and slice into bitesize pieces (sprinkle with
lemon juice until ready to use). Chop the celery finely. Cool the
potatoes by draining and placing in pan of ice water. Combine all
ingredients and mix with dressing and dill if desired. I used Medford
Farms (tm) Creamy Dill No-Oil Dressing. Chill several hours. Quick
and delicious.
