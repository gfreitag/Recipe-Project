Title: Curried Rice
Categories: Chinese
Yield: 8 servings
1 t  Salt
1/2 c  Slivered almonds
1/2 c  Raisins
4 c  Boiling water
1 c  Green peas, fresh or frozen
2 c  Basmati rice, white or brown
1/4 t  Ground cinnamon
1/8 t  Ground cardamom (or seeds of
-cardamom pods, crushed)
1/2 t  Turmeric
Toast the rice in a large skillet over medium heat until it starts to
become opaque and somewhat chalky in appearance. Add remaining
ingredients, except peas, and bring to a simmer.

Cover the pot and cook until rice is tender and all the water is
absorbed (20 minutes for white rice, 60 minutes for brown rice).

Stir in the peas just before serving (a few minutes sooner if you're
using fresh peas).

Serves 6-8. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40 ---
