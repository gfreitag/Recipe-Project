Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian, Asian
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Hoisin sauce
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Dark soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Sesame oil
1 lb Firm bean curd (tofu)
8    Whole scallions
1/2 c  Peanut oil
1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
2 tb Coarsely chopped garlic
2 tb Rice wine
CUT THE BEAN CURD cake into 1-by-3-by-1-inch pieces. Lay them on paper
towels and drain for 10 minutes. At a slight diagonal, cut the
scallions into 3-inch pieces. Heat a wok or large saute pan until it
is hot. Add the 1/2 cup of peanut oil, and when it is hot, fry the
bean curd on both sides until it is golden brown. Drain the bean curd
well on paper towels. Drain and discard the oil. Wipe the wok clean,
reheat, and add 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil. Then add scallions and
garlic, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Put in the rest of the
ingredients except the sesame oil. Bring the mixture to a boil,
return the fried bean curd pieces and cook over high heat for 10
minutes or until the bean curd has absorbed most of the sauce. Add
the sesame oil, and give the mixture a final turn. Serve at once.
