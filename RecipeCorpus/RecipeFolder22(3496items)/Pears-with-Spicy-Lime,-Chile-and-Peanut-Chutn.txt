Cut each pear lengthwise into quarters. Using amelon baller or
grapefruit spoo, create a well in the center of each quarter. If
pears are very small, consider using halves instead of quarters.

In a small bowl, prepare chutney by mixing together lime juice and
zest, red pepper, garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar and peanuts. Spoon
chutney in hollowed out section of pear quarters. Add a sprig of mint
for garnish. Place on a serving tray. Makes 12 appetizers.

Helpful hint: Chutney can be prepared up to a week in advance. To
avoid browning, cut pears no earlier than a few hours before serving;
then sprinkle with lime juice.
