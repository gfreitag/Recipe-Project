MMMMM------------------------FOR THE SOUP-----------------------------
1 tb Parsley
6 c  Stock (see above)
1 pk Silken soft Mori-Nu tofu
1/8 ts Black pepper

2 tb White miso
1 lb Asparagus
2 tb Olive oil

Snap off the lower ends of asparagus where they easily break and
bend. Chop these and add to the other stock ingredients with 8 cups
water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes and strain. Cut
off the very tips of the asparagus and set aside. Chop the middle
pieces and set aside.

Saute the leeks, onions and shallots in olive oil over medium heat
for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the middle pieces of asparagus,
salt, pepper and parsley and stock. Simmer for 10 minutes or until
asparagus is tender. Blend with the miso and strain well through a
fine screen or food mill.

Blend the tofu and add to the soup. In another pot bring a few cups
of water to a boil with a little salt. Cook the asparagus tips until
crisp-tender and strain in a colander. Garnish soup with asparagus
tips. Serves 6-8.
