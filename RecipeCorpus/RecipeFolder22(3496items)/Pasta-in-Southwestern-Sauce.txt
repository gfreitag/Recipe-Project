While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook
pasta 3-5 mintues, or until tender. Stir often to prevent sticking.

Drain pasta well. Rinse breifly with hot water to remove excess
starch, and drain again.

Add pasta to sauce in skilelt, sprinkle with basil and parsley. Toss
well with sauce and serve immediately.

Helpful hints:

Select a fresh pasta that contains no egg yolks; otherwise, you will
add cholesterol to the dish. (Note: Vegan pastas are available)

For added color and taste, use fresh pastas made with spinach,
artichoke, beet and other flavors.

To reduce spiciness, remove seeds and inner ridges from jalapenos
before chopping. To tame further, use less jalapeno.
