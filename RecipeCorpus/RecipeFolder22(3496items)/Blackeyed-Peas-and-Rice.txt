Look thru peas for rocks and wash through 3 waters.  Soak peas in
water overnight in fridge.  The next day, throw out water they soaked
in; some claim this keeps beans from giving you a problem, but stay
on this diet a couple weeks and you won't have a problem anyway.  It
goes away.  Wash stew meat and put stew meat and pre-soaked peas in
big pot on stove and bring to boil, with PLENTY of water.  Add
seasonings to taste.  If you use Cajun seasoning it contains salt; so
don't add extra salt!!!!  Otherwise, add salt to taste.  When stew
meat and peas come to a boil, reduce to Medium and keep watching to
add water so they don't scorch.  After about 40 minutes add packet of
Rice and Sauce, preferably Cajun flavor.  Start watching the water
really carefully now, and add a pint from time to time. After about
20 minutes of rice cooking, add bell pepper, onion, and more
seasonings if you need.  (This dish is good hot and peppery)
Everything should be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all
is ready, eat!
