addition, then add the milk, lemon rind, and vanilla.  Stir in the
flour and blend until smooth. In another large mixing bowl, beat the
egg whites until they form soft peaks, then gradually add the

pour the mixture into the prepared crust. Bake for 55 minutes or
until the center appears firm. Let the cake cool in the oven for 15
