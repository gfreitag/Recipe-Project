1.  Peel and quarter potatoes. Place ina  medium or large pot with
water to cover. Add garlic, celery, parsley, peppercorns, onion, and
bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for
15 to 20 minutes or until very tender.

2.  While potatoes are cooking, prepare filling. Heat 1 T oil,
onion, and garlic in a large skillet. Saute for 1 minute over medium
heat, then add mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Crumble tofu in
chunks into skillet and saute briefly, mixing well. Stir in barbecue
sauce, yeast, gravy mix, thyme, paprika, and tamari. Mix well and
saute, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes over medium heat. Preheat
oven to 400.

3.  Transfer potatoes from water to a large bowl, reserving potato
stock. Add miso, oil, and 3/4 to 1 cup potato stock to potatoes, in
1/4- to 1/3-cup increments, mashing as you add the stock. Add only
enough water to moisten potatoes adequately. Do not overmoisten.

4.  Add corn and spinach to filling and mix well. Pour filling into
an oiled, shallow ovenproof casserole.
Pat down with back of a large spoon. Spread potato crust evenly over
filling, smoothing top with a spoon or spatula. Dust evenly with
paprika. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until crust is golden.

5.  While casserole bakes, prepare gravy. Heat oil in a large
skillet. Add flour and yeast, and stir with a whisk over medium heat
to form a paste. Slowly stir in 2 1/2 cups of reserved potato water,
whisking as you stir to allow gravy to thicken. Stir in instant gravy
mix and continue whisking until gravy is thick and smooth; add
additional potato water, if necessary.

6. Serve casserole with crust on the bottom and filling on top. Spoon
gravy over top.
