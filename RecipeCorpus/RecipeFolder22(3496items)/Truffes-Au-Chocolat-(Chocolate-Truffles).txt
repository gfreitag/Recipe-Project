Title: Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)
Categories: Chocolate, Candy, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
2 oz Powdered sugar
2 tb Fresh cream
3 oz Chocolate
1 1/2 oz Butter
Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by
skimming the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to
settle. Melt butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler,
stirring to mix well. When melted, remove the double boiler from the
fire, leaving the hot water in the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift
the powdered sugar in slowly, so that it will not form lumps,
stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool place. (In winter, 12
hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time, cut a piece of
this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife or spoon.
Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of the
bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles
are better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into
balls, you can also shape them to look more like truffles.
