Title: Lettuce Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
3 1/2 c  Chicken Stock
1    Med. Head Iceberg Lettuce,
-shredded
1    Egg Yolk, slightly beaten
1/2 c  Heavy Cream
2 tb Minced Onion
1 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg (fresh grated)
1 ds Fresh Ground Pepper
Saute onion in butter until lightly golden.  Stir in flour, salt,
nutmeg & pepper.  If using bouillon cubes, dissolve in boiling water;
add to onion mixture slowly.  Cook over medium heat, stirring until
thickened. Add lettuce.  Cover and let cook 3 minutes.  Mix together
egg yolk and cream. Stir 1/4 c. Soup into yolk/cream mixture.  Pour
this mixture into soup, stirring constantly.  Cook over low heat,
stirring, until soup comes to a boil.  Remove from heat and serve at
once!

As I said, this is a great way to use up wilted lettuce of any kind.
I have used all different types singularly and together.  BTW, it
serves six!
