Title: Potato-Mushroom Burgers
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Carrots; grated
2 ts Ginger root, fresh; grated
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Bread crumbs; dry
1/2 c  Sesame seeds
3    Garlic cloves; minced
1/2 c  Mushrooms; finely chopped
4    Scallions; thinly sliced
1 tb Canola oil
1/2 c  Cashews, raw, unsalted
2 1/2 c  Potatoes; mashed
Saute garlic, mushrooms and scallions in oil until vegetables are
limp, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place cashews in a blender or food
processor and grind to a coarse meal. Transfer mushroom mixture and
ground cashews to a large bowl and add potatoes, carrots, ginger,
salt and pepper. Add bread crumbs and mix well. The mixture will be
soft and moist.

On a large bakin sheet or bread board, make 8 to 10 beds of sesame
seeds for patties. Using a large spoon, scoop out vegetable mixture
and form 8 to 10 patties; place on sesame beds. Flip to coat both
sides generously. Gently transfer to a well-oiled vegetable grill and
grill for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until medium brown. Makes 8 to
10 patties.

Variation: Saute burgers in olive oil until golden brown.
