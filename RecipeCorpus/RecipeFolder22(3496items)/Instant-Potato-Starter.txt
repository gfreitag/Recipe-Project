1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Oil,
6 c  Flour
1 c  Starter,
1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
1 ts Salt,
STARTER:  Dissolve yeast in 1/2 C. of warm water. Add remaining
ingred. and stir well. Place in glass jar, covered loosely with foil,
plastic wrap, etc. (to allow for gas expansion). Keep at room
temperature for 24 hrs. Then place starter in frig. for 3-5 days.
Feed: After starter has been refrigerated 3-5 days, take out and feed
it above mixture. Let stand out (loosely covered) all day (8-10
hrs.). Take out 1 C. to use in making bread and return remaining
starter to frig. Keep refrigerated from 3-5 days; feed again. After
feeding, take out 1 C. to use in making bread, or give 1 C. to a
friend, or throw 1 C. away. Starter must be fed again in 3-5 days.
Bread: Mix first 5 ingred. together. Add in flour 1 C. at a time
until thoroughly mixed. Knead until good "elastic" consistency, but
don't over knead. Place approx. 2 Tbl. oil in bottom of large boowl;
turn dough over so oiled side is facing up. Cover with dish towl; let
rise until double - about 8-10 hrs. Punch down, knead again only a
few times, mixing in flour until good consistency. Divide dough in
half, shape into loaves. Place in ungreased loaf pans; let rise again
(4-6 hrs.). Bake @ 350 for 25-35 min. until golden brown and loaves
sound hollow when tapped. Cinnamon Bread: Before placing dough in
loaf pans to rise, roll out, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with
cinnamon and sugar. Roll up and place in loaf pan to rise. This is a
great receipe - I've enjoyed it for years! Your starter should bubble
a little after it has set out for the day (before you feed it). If
not, I have added yeast to the warm water of the "feed" and added it
in and the starter has recovered just fine! Enjoy! And let me know
how you like it! Don in Arlington, TX 8/28 9:40 a.m.
