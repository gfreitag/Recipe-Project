Title: Crispfried Tofu and Greens
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Cornstarch
1/2 c  Cornmeal or cornstarch
2    Cakes of tofu, frozen
-overnight and thawed
1/2 c  Water or vegetable stock
Marinade:

1/3 c soy sauce 1/4 c rice vinegar 1 T finely grated gingerroot 2
cloves garlic, minced or pressed dash cayenne

Sauce:

3 T soy sauce 1/4 c dry sherry 2 tsp rice vinegar 2 tsp honey or brown
sugar

Vegetables:

3 T oil 3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed 1 c thinly sliced onion 6
c mix of coarsely chopped pak choi, chard, kale, nappa cabbage or 9
c. chopped spinach

Gently squeeze as much liquid out of thawed tofu as possible.  Cut
tofu crosswise into 1/2inch thick slices, then diagonally, to make 4
triangles.* Combine marinade ingredients and mix well.  Arrange tofu
triangles in one layer in a dish and cover with marinade.  Allow to
sit for at least 10 minutes to absorb the flavors.  Prepare sauce mix
by combining all ingredients in a small bowl.  In a separate bowl mix
the water or stock and the 1 tsp.  cornstarch.  Dredge marinated tofu
pieces in cornmeal or cornstarch and fry over medium heat in 1/8 to
1/4 inch of oil, for 34 minutes on each side.  Drain and keep warm in
200F oven. Add leftover marinade to sauce mix.  Heat 3 T.  oil in a
wok.  Stirfry garlic and onion until onion is tender.  Add greens and
continue stirfrying until just wilted but not mushy.  Add sauce mix
and cornstarch mix and stirfry just until sauce is thickened.  Add
reserved fried tofu. Serve with rice.
