Categories: Meat, Bread
Yield: 8 servings
1 pk Frozen spinach; (10 oz)
- thawed and drained
1    Egg; lightly beaten
1    7 oz jar diced pimientos,
- drained
1 pk Sliced pepperoni; 3 oz
12    Large pimiento-stuffed green
- olives, cut in half
1 cn Refrigerated prepared pizza
- crust dough (10 oz)
4 c  Mozzarella cheese; grated
1 lb Spicy pork sausage, browned
- and drained
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
1 ts Oregano flakes
1/2 ts Basil flakes
Preheat oven to 400F.  Unroll dough and cut off one-fourth of dough
crosswise; set aside.  Line a greased 9 1/4x5 1/4x2 1/2-inch loaf pan
with the large piece of dough. Moisten the dough with water at
corners and press to seal.  Place one-half of the cheese on the
bottom of the dough and top with sausage. Spoon tomato sauce over
sausage and sprinkle with oregano and basil.  Combine spinach with
egg and spread over tomato sauce. Layer pimientos on top of spinach
and top with remaining cheese. Arrange the pepperoni on top of the
cheese layer.  Top with olive halves. Cover filling with reserved
dough and crimp edges of dough to seal. Cut slits in top of dough to
allow steam to escape. Bake 50 minutes or until crust is well browned
(if crust browns too quickly, cover loosely with aluminum foil).
Allow to cool 10 minutes before removing from pan and cutting into
slices.
