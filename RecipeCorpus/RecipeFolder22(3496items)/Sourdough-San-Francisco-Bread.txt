5 1/2 c  White flour
1/2 ts Baking soda

in warm place 1 hr or until double in bulk. Combine 1 c of the
remaining flour with baking soda. Stir batter down and add
flour-baking soda mixture. Gradually add remaining flour to make a
stiff dough. Turn out onto floured board and knead, adding additional
flour only as needed to prevent sticking, approx 300 strokes of
folding and turnin or until dough is smooth and elastic. Sprinkle a
greased baking sheet with cornmeal. Form dough into 2 oblong loaves
and place on sheet. Cover with towel and let rise in warm place 1 to
1-1/2 hr or until not quite double in size. With sharp razor, slash
the tops of loaves diagonally. Mist with water and bake in 450 oven
10 mins. Reduce heat to 400 and bake 35 mins longer or until bread
tests done. For a harder crust, place a pan of hot water on bottom of
oven and mist with water several times during baking. Remove pan of
water after 15 mins of baking. Turn out onto wire rack and cool.
NOTE: If you like your sourdough very dar, remove the baked bread
from the pan or sheet and place under broiler about 2 mins, or until
rich brown in color.
