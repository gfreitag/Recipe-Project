Title: Hearty Bean and Vegetable Stew
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetarian
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 c  Mushrooms  diced
1    Onion  diced
1 t  Basil, dried
1 t  Parsley, dried
1    Bay leaf
3    Clove garlic  minced
1 t  Black pepper  ground
1 c  Rice or pasta  cooked
1 lb Beans, assorted, dry
2 c  Vegetable juice
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Soy sauce
1/3 c  Apple or pineapple juice
-vegetable stock or water
1/2 c  Celery  diced
1/2 c  Parsnips  diced
1/2 c  Carrots  diced
Sort and rinse beans, then soak overnight in water.

Drain beans and place in crockpot.  Add vegetable juice, wine, soy
sauce, and apple or pineapple juice.  Cover with vegetable stock or
water; the amount added depends on whether you prefer a soup (more
liquid) or a stew (less).  The juice adds just a tad of sweetness and
the soy sauce adds depth and the tang of salt.

Cook at high for 2 hours.  Add vegetables, herbs, and spices, and
cook for 56 hours at low until carrots and parsnips are tender.  When
tender, add rice or pasta and cook for one additional hour.

Notes:

For beans use 3 or 4 kinds, such as: black, red kidney, pinto, baby
lima, lentil, and green and/or yellow split peas.

prepared in a crock pot.  Just decrease the liquid ingredients (not
as much liquid will evaporate from a closed slowcooker) and let it
rip for 6 or more hours.
