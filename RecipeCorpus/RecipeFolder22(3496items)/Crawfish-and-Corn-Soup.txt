Make stock first.  Ten pounds of boiled crawfish make one pound of
meat. Peel crawfish, reserving shells and claws.  Rinse shells and
let drain. Melt butter in a large pot; add shells and fry until
sizzling and hot, turning them often.  When shells are hot enough,
heat a small pot, pour in brandy and ignite.  Remove shells from
fire, pour in brandy, tossing and turning until the flame dies down.

Add wine and water to cover shells.  Add onion, celery, green onions,
parsley, garlic, thyme and bay leaf.  Let it all simmer for an hour.
Strain carefully and reserve.

In another pot, melt butter, add flour and let cook on low fire until
medium brown.  Add chopped vegetables and let cook on a low fire until
wilted, stirring often.  Chop tomatoes and add to pot with reserved
liquid. Let cook a few minutes.

Add stock -- just enough to make a soupy consistency -- then add
Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, thyme, crawfish, corn and about four
of the cobs (for added flavor).  Let simmer an hour.  Taste for salt,
pepper and Tabasco.  If using boiled crawfish, it is usually peppery
enough.

Remove the cobs and serve.

If the soup is too thick, add more stock or water.  If it's too thin,
cook a little more flour and add to thicken it.

Serves 8.

NOTE:  If you prefer to buy crawfish tails already picked, buy a
couple of pounds of boiled crawfish and pick them so as to have the
shells to make your stock.  Shrimp may be substituted.
