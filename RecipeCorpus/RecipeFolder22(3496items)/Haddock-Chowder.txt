HADDOCK CHOWDER From America:

Have the haddock cleaned and cut up to boil.  Barely cover with salted
water and cook until the fish comes off the bones. Don't cook until
the flesh is soft and mushy. Set aside to cool.

While fish is cooling, cut the pork into 1/4" cubes and fry until
crisp in a large heavy kettle. Drain the cubes on paper towels and
pour off all but 4 tbls of the fat. In this fat, cook the chopped
onions over low heat until trnasparent.  Add the potatoes and enough
of the fish liquor to cover them. Simmer gently until potatoes are
cooked.

Pick the fish flakes from the bones, adding to the chowder mixture
when the potatoes are done.  Add quart of milk and evaporated milk.
Set aside until serving time.

It imporves the flavor of the chowder greatly to let it stand for
several hours before serving.  Be sure it is piping hot when bringing
it to the table.

Biscuits and pickles always go with a good chowder.
