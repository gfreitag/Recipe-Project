This French side dish is hearty enough for a whole meal when served
with a green salad. The thin tomato slices add flavor and help make
the potatoes tender.

2 T olive oil 1 t tomato paste 1 lge all-purpose potato, scrubbed and
cut into slices 1/16-in thick 1 plum tomato, cut into thin slices
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 t Parmesan cheese 1/2
t freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 400F. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive
oil and tomato paste. Add the potato slices, tossing to cover evenly.
In an 8-inch ovenproof skillet, layer the potatoes around the outside
and in the center. Slide the tomato slices evenly between the sliced
potato. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and heat the pan on top
of the stove at medium-high heat until crackling noises are heard,
about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven to bake until the
slices are slightly crisp and the potato is tender when pierced with
a knife, about 25 minutes. Remove, sprinkle on the Parmesan cheese
and run the dish under the broiler just until the cheese is lightly
colored, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, watching carefully. Remove and sprinkle
on the parsley, and serve.
