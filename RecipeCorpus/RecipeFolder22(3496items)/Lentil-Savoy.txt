Title: Lentil Savoy
Categories: Vegetarian, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
-savoy) - 1 mixing-bowl-ful
1    Red bell pepper
1/2    -1 Tbsp
-cinammon
3/4 c  Lentils
1 1/2 c  Well-spiced veggie stock
Or more as needed
1/2 lb Mushrooms
1/2    Head purple kale (aka salad
1. Rinse lentils and cook in 1 1/2 cups of veggie stock. (I used a
rice cooker for this step.)

2. While the lentils are cooking cut the stems off of the kale. Chop
stems into 1/2 - 1 inch peices

3. Chop the red bell pepper.

4. Put pepper and stems in large pan with enough stock to cover the
bottom of the pan (1/4"?) and cook on medium for a couple of minutes
then turn flame all the way down.

5. While the peppers etc. are cooking wash and chop mushrooms. Add to
pan.

6. Around 20-30 minutes after step 1. (probably 5-10 minutes after
end of step 5.) pour the lentils into the pan. If you are using the
rice cooker, just shut it off manually - don't wait for it to finish.

7. Add cinnamon and other spices (see note).  Stir mixture in pan
then add the kale leaves on top - this will steam the leaves, don't
mix them in.

8. Cook for another 15 minutes or so until the leaves have a buttery
taste.

9. Remove the kale from the top and serve separately.

enjoy! Have some black pepper available on the table for the lentil
stew. Try the kale leaves with some nutritional yeast...

Poster's NOTES: * If you don't have stock handy try adding alot of
spices in step 7. Try oregano, chile passilla, roasted garlic, etc. *
Use wild mushrooms if at all possible - they are more expensive than
buttons (unless you or friends go mushrooming) but are worth it for
the extra taste. (IMHO, of course. ;-) * Purple kale - you know, the
type they use as a decoration in salad bars...
