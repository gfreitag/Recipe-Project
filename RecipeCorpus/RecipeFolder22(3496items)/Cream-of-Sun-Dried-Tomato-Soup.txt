This creamy, vibrant red soup has but 100 calories per serving if you
use low-fat milk and no cream.

PLACE THE MILK, ONION, peppercorns, salt and bouquet garni in a
saucepan and bring slowly to a boil. Form a smooth paste of the rice
flour and the cold milk. Put into the just-boiling milk and stir
briskly until there are no lumps. Simmer over very low heat for 20
minutes. Meanwhile, boil the sun-dried tomatoes in the 2 cups of
water; do not drain. Strain the milk mixture, add the tomatoes and
their liquid, and simmer another 5 minutes. In a blender, in batches,
liquefy the soup. Return to the stove and bring just to a boil. Add
the optional cream, if desired, and serve in hot bowls garnished with
a minced green herb.
