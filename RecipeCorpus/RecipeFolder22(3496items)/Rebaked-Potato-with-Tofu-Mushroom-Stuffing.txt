Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 lg Baked potatoes
6 oz Soft tofu, mashed (3/4 c.)
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Chopped onion
3/4 c  Chopped mushrooms
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Sage
In a skillet, combine onion, mushrooms, soy sauce and sage. Cover and
stew over low heat until mushrooms are tnder, about 10 minutes.

Cut baked potatoes in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out insides,
leaving a shell about 1/4 inch thick.

Puree scooped-out potato, tofu and salt in a food processor, or whip
them together by hand, making the mixture as smooth as possible. Stir
in all but a quarter cup of the cooked mushroom-onion mixture. Fill
the potato shells and top each half with 1 tablespoon of the reserved
mushroom- onion mixture. Place potatoes on a baking sheet in oven (or
toaster oven) and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Makes 4 potato
halves.
