Title: French Chocolate Cake
Categories: Chocolate, Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 10 servings
1 c  Flour
1/3 c  Hazelnuts, coarsely chopped
1 ts Baking powder
7 oz Semisweet chocolate
14 tb Butter or margarine
4    Eggs
3/4 c  Sugar
Makes about 10 servings

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Grease a springform pan with
detachable bottom that has a diameter of about 9 1/2 inches.

Melt cooking chocolate and butter in a  thick-bottomed pot over low
heat. Beat eggs and sugar until light and airy.  Carefully stir the
somewhat cooled chocolate mixture into egg mixture.

Blend flour, nuts, and baking powder together, and fold carefully into
batter.  It's important to fold it in gently.

Pour batter into pan and bake in the oven for about 15 minutes.  The
cake should not become firm.  The "unbaked" batter tastes like a
delicious filling.

You may garnish cooled cake with a bit of grated chocolate and a ring
of whipped topping.
