1 1/2 C dry black beans, rinsed and soaked 6 hrs or overnight 1 small
onion, diced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1/2 chipotle chile,
minced or 1 T smoked chile salsa 1 (16-oz) can peeled tomatoes,
chopped, juice reserved 1/2 bunch of cilantro GARNISHES: Sour cream
Grated muenster or Monterey Jack cheese Chile pequins or other small
dried red chiles DRAIN THE BEANS and put them in a soup pot with
enough cold water to cover by a couple of inches. Bring to a boil and
skim off the foam that rises to the surface; then add the onions and
the garlic. Lower the heat and cook until the onions are soft, about
15 minutes; add the tomatoes and their juice, the pureed chiles and
half the cilantro and lightly salt. Simmer until the beans are
tender, an hour or so. Occasionally give them a stir while they're
cooking. When done, taste for salt, stir in the remaining cilantro
and garnish as desired. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
