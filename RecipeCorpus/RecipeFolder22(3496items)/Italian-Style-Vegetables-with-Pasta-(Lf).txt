Heat a large skillet.  Add the stock and all the ingredients except
the pasta.  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 15 to 20 minutes,
or until al dente. Cook the pasta according to the package
directions. Drain well and serve with the vegetable sauce. Makes 4
servings. One serving is equal to 1 cup pasta and 1 cup sauce.

*I used the water from soaking the sun-dried tomatoes instead of the
vegetable broth.  We really enjoyed this, it's DELICIOUS!
