1 lb Parsnips, thinly sliced
1 lb Apples, peeled/cored/sliced

Heat the butter, and when foaming, add the parsnips, apples, and
onions. Soften them but do not let them color.  Add the curry powder,

thick, dilute with a little stock or water.  Add the cream and
reheat, but do not let it boil.  Serve garnished with chopped chives
or parsley.
