4    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Sugar
1.  Put eggs and vanilla in a bowl.  Beat in sugar and salt just until
mixedÄno more.  Stir in milk.  (It's scalded when bubbles form around
the edge of pan.)

2.  Pour through a sieve into eight 5-ounce custard cups-no buttering
needed.  Sprinkle lightly with nutmeg, then place cups, not touching,
in shallow baking pan.

3.  Pull out oven shelf a little and set pan on it for easy handling.
Pour boiling water from kettle into the pan to make a depth of about
1 inch around the cups.

4.  Let them bake lazily in a slow over (325ø) 30 minutes or until
centers are almost set but still soft.  (Do not over bake: custards
will set as the cool.)  Lift cups from water; cool.

Makes 8 5-oz. custard cups.
