3 tb Parsley flakes
1 tb Italian seasoning
2 lb Turkey italian sausage
1 ts Honey
1 ts Salt
Pepper to taste
4    Eggs (or egg substitute to
-equal 4 eggs)
Parmesan cheese to taste
1 pk Uncooked lasagna noodles
Water to cook noodles
1 ts Salt for water
4 c  Shredded mozzarella cheese
-low cal, low fat
3    Jars pasta sauce of your
-choice (or 8 cups)
2 lb Low-fat ricotta cheese
1 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Low-fat parmesan cheese
1. Heat sufficient water in a large sauce pan to cook the lasagna
noodles. Add the salt to the water to speed cooking. Add the uncooked
noodles to the boiling water, and boil about 10 minutes or until
flexi- ble but not fully cooked. Drain on aluminum foil or waxed
paper and cool completely.

2. In a large saute pan, saute turkey italian sausage until completely
cooked. Crumble. Drain and set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, add ricotta cheese and mix in eggs
whisking one at a time to blend well. Add parmesan cheese, mozarella
cheese, parsley, sugar, honey, salt, italian seasoning, pepper, and
mix well.

4. In a very large (roasting pan size) baking pan, add 1/2 cup of the
sauce to the bottom. Line the bottom with lasagna noodles; add 1/2 of
the cheese mixture, and then add 1/2 of the sausage on top of the
cheese. Add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of sauce over this layer, top with
noodles and repeat process. When the final layer of noodles is added,
top with sauce and additional mozarella cheese and parmesan cheese,
if desired.

5. Heat oven to 400F. Bake for 30 minutes covered, then uncover and
bake for an additional 30 minutes or until cheese is bubbly (and the
pan is sufficiently dripping to make a mess ;). Serve in 4 x 3
squares.
