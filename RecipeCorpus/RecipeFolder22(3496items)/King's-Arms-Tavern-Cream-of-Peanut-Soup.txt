This is as served at the King's Arms Tavern in Colonial Williamsburg,
Virginia.

"Peanuts (ground nuts) are from Brazil that sailed with the Portuguese
explorers to Africa and back to the Americas with the Negro. In 1794,
Thomas Jefferson recorded the yield of sixty-five peanut hills at
Monticello.  The cultivation of peanuts increased in the South in the
nineteenth century, but it was not until after the Civil War that they
gained national acceptance."
