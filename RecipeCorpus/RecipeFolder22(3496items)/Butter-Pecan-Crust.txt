To quote the author, "Marg Curry served this at a ladies' luncheon.
The filling was fresh glazed strawberries slathered with whipped
cream. But you could use this crust whenever you want to be
impressive."

Blend together butter, flour and sugar until the mixture is crumbly.
Stir in pecans. Press the mixture into a 9 inch pie plate and bake at
375F for 12 to 15 minutes. "Extravagant but delicious.
Try this with other nuts - almonds, brasils, walnuts - chopped with a
knife."
