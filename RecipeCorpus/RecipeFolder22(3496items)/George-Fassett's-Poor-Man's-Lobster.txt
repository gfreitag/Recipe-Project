Title: George Fassett's Poor Man's Lobster
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 serving  Text only:

"If you like seafood, try this sometime. It's a fillet from the Monk
Fish, and is usually available at most fresh seafood counters.

The meat is translucent pink, with a darker purple membrane on one
side. Cut off that membrane, and discard. Then cut the fillet into 1
1/2 to 2 inch chunks.

Bring a pan of water to a boil and drop the chunks into it. Count to
10 then spoon back out. The meat will double in size and be a nice
white color.

Place chunks on a broiling pan and baste with melted butter (add lemon
and/or garlic if desired). Broil on each side for about 5 minutes,
until lightly browned.

Cut into fork-sized pieces and dip into melted butter, just as you
would lobster. A little milder flavor, but definitely is a good
substitute, at a much cheaper price! Cook some cube steaks with this
meal and call it Poor Man's Surf and Turf!"
