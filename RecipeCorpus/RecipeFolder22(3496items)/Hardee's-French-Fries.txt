Oil temp. is critical in cooking these french fries. Be sure to test
the oil on several potato slices before cooking large portions. And
keep in mind that the more your cook at once, the longer your cooking
time may be.
The blanching stage may seem to be a nuicance, but it is crucial
if you want your fries to come out right. Blanching allows the fries
to soak up a little oil while cooling, and wil make them crispy when
done.
