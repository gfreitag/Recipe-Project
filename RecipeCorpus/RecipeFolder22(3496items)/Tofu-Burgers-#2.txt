Wrap tofu in a kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels. Place
on a cutting board, and weight with an iron skillet or wooden cutting
board for 30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, saute onion and garlic in oil
until onion is limp and slightly brown on the edges.

Remove towels and place tofu in a large bowl. Mash with a fork and add
onion-garlic mixture. Add chili sauce, worcestershire sauce, soy
sauce, cumin, bread crumbs and hazelnuts if desired; mix well. Place
in a food processor and pulse to form a uniform texture. Add salt and
pepper to taste. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

With wet hands, shape tofu mixture into 8 to 10 patties and place on
a well oiled vegetable grill. Handle patties gently; they're
delicate. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until browned.

Variation: Instead of grilling, saute burgers in olive oil until
lightly browned on both sides.

Note:  This burger is especially tasty when served with a spicy sauce
made of low-sodium soy sauce mixed with chili sauce or barbecue sauce
and topped with sauteed mushrooms.
