Since 1952, when Colonel Harland Sanders opened his first franchise,
only a select few have been privy to the secret "herb & spices"
contained in the billion-dollar blend. To protect the top-secret
recipe, the company claims, portions of the secret blend are premixed
at two confidential spice cos. and then distributed to KFC's offices,
where they are combined. In 1983, in his book "Big Secrets", author
Wm. Poundstone hired a lab to analyze a dry sample of the spice mix.
The surprising discovery was that instead of identifying "eleven
herbs & spices," the analysis showed only four ingredients: flour,
salt, pepper, and monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer.
The cooking proceedure is believed to be the other half of the
secret. Colonel Sanders became famous for using a pressure cooker
shortly after its invention in 1939. He discovered that hungry
travelers greatly appreciated the 10 min. pressure-cooking time
(compared to the usual 30 min. it used to take for frying chicken),
and the new process made the chicken juicy and moist inside.
KFC is the 3rd largest fast-food chain in the country, and uses
around 500 million chickens every year.
