4 tb Soft butter
1    Egg
1 c  Warm milk
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Chocolate chips
1 pk Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
2 tb Brown sugar
2 tb White sugar
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon
Put the first 10 ingredients into the pan, select white bread and push
start. When the Auto Bakery "beeps" 5 minutes from the end of the
second mixing, add the chocolate chips.

NOTE: The chips tend to get a little well done, so turn the darkness
control a bit toward light. This bread has a cake-like texture.
