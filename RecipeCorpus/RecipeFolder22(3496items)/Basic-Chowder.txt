Title: Basic Chowder
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 2 servings
1    Bay leaf
2    Cloves of garlic (or 3)
1 ts Pepper
4 oz Bacon bits
1    Carrot, thinly sliced
2    Sticks celery, thinly sliced

"All you really need is a big pot and some bacon bits.  After that,
you improvise....  (Otherwise) we are stuck with the tyranny of the
formal recipe which defines The Only Way To Do It in a form as exact,
and frequently as exciting, as a prescription from the doctor."
