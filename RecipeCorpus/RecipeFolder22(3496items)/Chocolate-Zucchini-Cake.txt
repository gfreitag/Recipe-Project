Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease a 9x13" pan.  Combine sugars,
butter and oil.  Add eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla and mix well. Sift
together the flour, cocoa, soda, cinnamon and salt. Add to the
mixture. Stir in zucchini. Pour into pan and sprinkle chips over the
top. Bake 45 mins, cool, then turn out on wire rack.

This is a really moist cake that may last for awhile.

About the best non-standard use for zucchini is this cake which
Catlyn's, a wonderful gourmet-to-go deli makes.

chocolate chips 2 c zuchini, unpeeled, grated (grate medium by hand)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease a 9x13 inch pan.

In a bowl, cream butter and eggs.  Add oil, vanilla and sugar. Blend

cloves, and cinnamon.  Add to the butter mixture alternately with the
