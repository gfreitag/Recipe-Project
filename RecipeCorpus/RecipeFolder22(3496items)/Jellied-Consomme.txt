If using homemade beef broth, be sure that you clarify the broth
before preparing this recipe.

In saucepan combine beef broth, onion, green pepper, parsley, and
worcestershire sauce. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat; simmer
uncovered, for 15 minutes to reduce liquid slightly (it should
measure 3 to 3 1/2 cups). Strain mixture, discarding vegetables.
Return the strained broth to saucepan.

In small bowl combine sherry and water; sprinkle gelatin over liquid
and let stand to soften gelatin. Stir gelatin mixture into broth;
heat and stir till gelatin dissolves. Pour into large bowl. Chill
till set. Before serving, whip cream and curry powder just to stiff
peaks. Break up consomme with a fork; spoon into serving dishes. Top
each serving with a dollop of the whipped cream. Makes 4 to 6
servings.
