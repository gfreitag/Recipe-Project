instructions

In 4-cup glass measure, combine butter and onions.  Microwave, uncov-
ered, on HIGH 1 min. or until onions are wilted.  Stir in soup, water
and vermouth.  Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 5 min. or until boiling,
stirring once during cooking.

Ladle soup into four 10-oz. bowls.  Sprinkle croutons over soup;
sprinkle with cheese.  Let stand, uncovered, 1 min. or until cheese

*TIP  In high-altitude areas, food may cook slower, even though  * *
it may boil vigorousl y.  For liquid mixtures such as soups,  * * you
may need a larger container; also remove the cover if  * * it's
boiling too hard. To compensate for low boiling temp-  * * eratures,
increase the power level by one level or lengthen  * * cooking time.
Liquids also tend to evaporate faster at high * * altitudes, so you
may need to add more water or liquid. *
