Title: Spiced Yam Pudding
Categories: Side dish, Holiday, Vegetable, Sweetpotato
Yield: 8 servings
Ground pepper; to taste
1 tb Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Nutmeg; freshly grated
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
-ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
4 md Sweet potatoes; or yams
-about 2 lbs
1    Onion
6    Eggs; lightly beaten
3 tb Vegetable oil
Kosher salt; and freshly
Set the oven at 375 degrees.  Peel the potatoes and grate them using
a flat rectangular grater with large square holes (I would use the
large grate on the FP), directly into the mixing bowl. Grate the
onion as well.

Beat in the eggs, 2 T of the oil, salt and pepper. Add the cinnamon,
nutmeg, cloves, brown sugar, flour and baking powder. Pour the
remaining 1 T of oil into a 8x11 baking dish. Grease the entire pan
with the oil. Pour the sweet potato into the prepared pan and bake in
the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until nicely browned.
Remove from the oven, slice into serving-size pieces and cover with
foil when ready to transport. Or serve immediately.
