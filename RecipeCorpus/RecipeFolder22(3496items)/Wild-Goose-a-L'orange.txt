Title: Wild Goose a L'orange
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Game
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 ts Mustard, dry
1/4 c  Currant jelly
2 tb Wine, port or cranberry
1    Orange, pared and sectioned
1 1/2 ts Cornstarch
1    Goose, wild ready to cook
1    Onion, minced
1/4 ts Tarragon leaves
2 tb Butter or margarine
1/2 c  Orange juice
2 tb Orange peel, shredded
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Wash a 6-8 lb. goose and pat dry. Skewer neck skin to back, cross
wing tips over back. Place goose breast-side-up on rack in shallow
roasting pan. Cook onion and tarragon in butter until onion is
tender. Add orange juice and peel, salt, mustard and jelly. Stir
constantly over medium heat until jelly melts.

Reduce heat, stir in wine and orange sections. Reserve half of sauce
for glaze; baste with remainder during 3 1/2 hour cooking time. If
goose gets too brown, place aluminum foil lightly over breast. Bird
is done when drumstick meat feels very soft.

Stir reserved sauce slowly into cornstarch, cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils 1 minute; serve
with goose.
