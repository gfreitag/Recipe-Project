There's nothing bland about tofu when it's combined with garlic, soy
sauce and other flavorful ingredients. This is a very quick
vegetarian meal--it takes only minutes to prepare.

1 lb firm fresh bean curd 3 T oil, preferably peanut 1/2 lb small
fresh button mushrooms, whole 1 T oil, preferably peanut 2 cloves
garlic, crushed 1/4 t salt SAUCE: 1 T dark soy sauce 2 T rice wine or
dry sherry 2 t sugar 2 T chicken or vegetable stock 2 scallions,
sliced on the diagonal

CUT THE BEAN CURD into 2-by-1/2-inch squares. Heat 3 tablespoons of
oil in a large frying pan or wok. When the oil is hot, fry the bean
curd on each side until it is golden brown. You may have to do this
in several batches. Drain each cooked batch on paper towels. Drain
the oil and wipe the wok clean. Reheat the wok over moderate heat and
add 1 tablespoon of oil. Then add the garlic and salt and stir-fry
for 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms and the rest of the sauce
ingredients. Cook over moderate heat for 5 minutes or until the
mushrooms are cooked. Return the bean curd to the wok and once it is
heated through, it is ready to be served.
