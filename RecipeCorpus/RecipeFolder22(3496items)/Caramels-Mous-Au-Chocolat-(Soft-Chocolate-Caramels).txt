Title: Caramels Mous Au Chocolat (Soft Chocolate Caramels)
Categories: Chocolate, Candy
Yield: 1 servings
2 oz Cocoa powder
1 1/4 oz Honey
1/2 lb Sugar
9 oz Fresh heavy cream
Cook together in a copper pan (or a pan not lined with tin) until the
mixture reaches th 'ball'stage. (To test the stage of the cooking by
finger, dip the thumb and index finger into cold water, then into the
mixture, bringing the 2 fingers together and dipping them again into
water. This should be done quickly to avoid burning. The mixture
forms a small ball that can be rolled with the tip of the fingers)
Pour this cooked sugar onto an oiled marble slab, keeping it at an
even thickness of 2/3 in., using 4 oiled rulers to make a framework.
Let cool and cut.
