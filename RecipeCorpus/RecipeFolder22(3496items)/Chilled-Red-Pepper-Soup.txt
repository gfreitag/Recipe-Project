4 c  Chicken stock
2 1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Sugar

4 c  Frozen or fresh corn kernels
MMMMM-------------------HERBED TORTILLA CRISPS------------------------
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
3 lg Flour tortillas
- cut into 12 sections each
2 tb Vegetable oil
IN THE BOWL of a food processor fitted with a steel chopping blade,
combine the peppers and garlic, and puree until smooth. Scrape the
mixture into a large non-aluminum bowl. Add the chicken stock,
buttermilk, sugar, salt, corn, nopales, oregano, and Tabasco, and
stir to blend. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour. In a small bowl,
combine the yogurt and oregano. Cover and refrigerate.

TO MAKE THE CRISPS: Turn on your broiled, and position the rack at
least 5 inches from the heat. Lightly brush the top of the tortilla
wedges with oil. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Sprinkle
on the oregano, crumbling it with your fingers as you do this, then
drizzle on the Parmesan cheese. Run them under the broiler, just to
crisp and color lightly, watching so they do not burn. Before
serving, ladle the soup into bowls. Add about a tablespoon of the
yogurt in the center. Sprinkle on chopped oregano and serve with the
tortilla wedges.

NOTE: Although Tex-Mex and other Latin delicacies are now available
in many markets across the country, pickled nopales or tender cactus
leaves are less available than jalapeno peppers, for example. If you
cannot find them, either chop a few pickled jalapeno peppers (with
the seeds removed) or simply omit them.
