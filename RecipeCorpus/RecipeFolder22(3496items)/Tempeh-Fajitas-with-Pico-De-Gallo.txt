Fajitas: Whisk together garlic and lime juice and pour over tempeh in
a flat dish. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for several
hours, turning tempeh occasionally.

Drain tempeh. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium-sized skillet over
moderate heat. Brown tempeh on both sides, adding an additional
tablespoon oil if necessary. Add stock or water and cover pan
tightly. Steam until liquid is almost absorbed, then add soy sauce
and turn tempeh to coat. Cover and cook away remaining liquid. Remove
tempeh from pan and cut into thin strips.

Wrap tortillas in aluminum foil or place in a tightly covered pan.
Warm in a moderate oven for several minutes. Remove from oven.
Arrange tempeh strips down the middle of each tortilla, spoon Pico de
Gallo on top, and fold or roll up. Serve immediately with extra
sauce. Makes 4 fajitas.
