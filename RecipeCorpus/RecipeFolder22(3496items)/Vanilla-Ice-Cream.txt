Title: Vanilla Ice Cream
Categories: Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Heavy cream (1 pint)
1    Vanilla bean OR (emergency)
2 ts Vanilla extract or flavor
1/8 ts Almond extract
3    Egg yolks
1 pn Salt
7/8 c  Sugar (1 c. less 2 tb.)
2 c  Milk
In large bowl of electric mixer, beat egg yolks with the salt and
about half the sugar untill very thick.  Meantime, heat the milk and
cream with the remaining sugar almost to simmering.  Remove from heat.

While beating egg-yolk mixture on low speed, slowly add about half of
the hot milk and cream; mix well.  Stop beating and stir the contents
of the bowl into the pot of hot milk and cream.

Split vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape as many of its tiny seeds as
possible into the pot; add the halves of the bean pod.  Cook the
custard over low heat, stirring constantly, until it almost simmers
(it should have thickened lightly, just enough to coat a metal
spoon).  Set pot at once into kitchen sink containing cold water to
stop the cooking.

Cool the custard and stir in the almond extract.  Chill it thoroughly,
covered. Fish out halves of vanilla bean.  Strain the custard into
the can of your ice cream freezer and freeze according to
manufacturer's directions.

Yield:  abt. 1 1/2 qts.
