An omnivorous friend of mine needed to borrow my kitchen and
appliances to make something for a New Year's Day party. He arrived
with bruschetta in mind and a bag full of tomatoes, herbs, and olive
oil. "Do you have a recipe?" he asked. (I guess I'm developing a rep
as a cook around here!) I pulled out Ornish's _Eat More, Weigh Less_
and we adapted this recipe from it.  (It originally called for
sun-dried tomatoes, we were doing this on the cheap!)

For the uninitiated (I was), this is sort of an Italian salsa. It
can be served on toasted french bread, on veggie sandwiches, as a
pasta sauce or, in my opiion, it would be great on polenta! We
tripled this recipe for the party and it made quite a bit!

Mix this all together in a container and let sit for at least one
hour! We ran everything through the food processor, so it hardly took
any time at all. It tasted great that night, and the leftover report
is that it improves over the next couple of days!

The Tracy Pikhart Ritter recipe suggests toasting french bread in a
350 degree oven till brown. Top with room temperature bruschetta.

enjoy! sal
