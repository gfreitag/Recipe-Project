Categories: Dessert, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Almond extract
1 cn Evaporated whole milk - (12
-oz.)
1/2 c  Whole milk
3 tb Sugar
3 lg Eggs
1/3 c  Brown sugar - dark brown,
-packed
2 ts Vanilla extract
1.  Preheat the oven to 300F.  In a small saucepan, combine the
granulated sugar with 1 tablespoon water.  Stir over moderate heat
until the sugar turns a medium caramel color, about 3 minutes.
Working quickly, pour the caramel into six (6-oz.) custard cups;
don't worry if they're not evenly coated.

2.  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs.  Whisk in the brown sugar,
vanilla and almond extract. Gradually whisk in the evaporated and
whole milk. Strain the mixture through a sieve and then pour it into
the custard cups. Place the cups in a baking pan and add enough hot
water to reach halfway up the sides.  Bake for about 1 hour or until
set. Let the flans cool to room temperature in the water bath. Cover
and refrigerate overnight.

3.  Run a knife tip around the edge of each flan and invert onto
dessert plates.  Serve cold.
