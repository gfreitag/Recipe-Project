Boil 2 quarts of salted water. Place spinach in the boiling water for
2 to 3 seconds and remove.

When onions and garlic have cooled, mix them with spinach and add
seasonings. Set aside.

Place a phyllo sheet on a dry work surface. Using a pastry brush,
lightly coat it with corn oil. Place a second sheet over the first
and brush with oil.

Fold the phyllo into thirds vertically, making a strip about 4" wide.

Place 2/3 cup of spinach filling on bottom left corn of phyllo.
Encase it by folding the left-hand, bottom corner over the filling,
forming a triangle with two equal sides.

Continue folding at a right angle to the end of the strip.

Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets until all filling is used.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown.

Serve immediately or store up to one week in refrigerator or freeze.
