Title: Glazed Pineapple with Macadamia Nut Crunch
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1/3 c  Light brown sugar (packed)
1 pn Salt
4 tb Unsalted butter; melted
1 lg Pineapple, ripe
- ends trimmed,
- skin and eyes removed
1 c  Coarsely chopped macadamias
Preheat the broiler.  Cut the pineapple into 8 slices, each about 1
inch thick.  For a decorative presentation you might want to cut
notched grooves 1 inch apart on the top of each slice to suggest the
grooves in a scallop shell.

In a small bowl, combine the nuts, brown sugar and salt.  Add the
butter and stir until well-blended.

Place the pineapple slices on a baking sheet lined with foil.
Sprinkle with a few tablespoons of the nut mixture or arrange in a
graphic pattern over each pineapple slice.

Broil the pineapple slices about 6 inches from the heat until the
filling starts to carmelize, about 1-1/2 minutes.  Serve hot.
