Title: Jody's Leftover Rice Snacks
Categories: Snack, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Parmesan, grated
1 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
1 ts Italian herbs
2 c  Rice, cooked
1 ea Eggs
1 c  Mozzarella, shredded
Preheat oven to 425.  Mix all ingredients.  Press mixture into 9"x13"
baking pan, greased, and bake until crispy.  Remove from pan and cut
into little squares. Serve as snack or appetizer.

Sylvia's notes: I made this for the kids, and they were delighted
with it. It's so easy to make, I may have Irene make it next time.  I
used a pie plate instead of a 9x13" pan, and it took about 30 minutes
to get nice and crispy on the outside.
