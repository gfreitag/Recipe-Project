1/3 c  Cornstarch
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1.  Put 4 cups of milk into a large, heavy saucepan.  Add unsweetened
chocolate and heat over moderate heat, watching carefully, until
bubbles form on milk around edges of panÄÄmilk is then scalded.
Remove form heat and set aside.

2.  Put cornstarch, sugar, salt and remaining 1/2 cup milk into a
small bowl.  Use a small whisk to stir cornstarch mixture until all
dry ingredients are moistened and no lumps remain.  Be sure mixture
is well stirred just before adding to hot milk.

3.  Using a large wire whisk, stir hot-milk mixture in saucepan while
gradually adding cornstarch-milk mixture.  Return saucepan to heat
and cook over moderately high heat, stirring constantly, until milk
mixture begins to boil.  Boil 1 minute longer, stirring constantly.

4.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.  (If you must stop
for a short while, place a piece of plastic wrap on surface of
pudding to prevent a skin from forming.)  Spoon 1/3 of the chocolate
pudding into a 2-quart souffl dish or fancy glass bowl. Top with 1/3
of the cookie crumbs.

5.  Set aside 1/2 cup cherry-pie filling.  Gently spoon half of
remaining filling onto crumbs in bowl.  Repeat layering with another
third of chocolate pudding, crumbs, the remaining cherry-pie filling
and the remaining chocolate pudding.

6.  Spoon remaining cookie crumbs around chocolate pudding to form a
border.  Top chocolate pudding layer with remaining 1/2 cup cherry-pie
filling, placing it in the center.  Refrigerate trifle, covered, until
pudding is well chilledÄÄ5 to 6 hours.
