Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Chilli powder
1/2 ts Amchoor *
4    Corn ear, husked
2    Lime
1 ts Salt

Cut limes in quarters, or halves if soft.  Mix dry ingredients
together.

Roast ears of corn, one or two at a time, over a hot grill or open gas
burner flame, until kernels are lightly browned.  Dip lime sections in
spice mixture.  Squeeze lime juice into corn kernels while rubbing
with cut surface of lime to allow lime juice to carry spices into the
corn. Continue until lime slices and spices are used up.
