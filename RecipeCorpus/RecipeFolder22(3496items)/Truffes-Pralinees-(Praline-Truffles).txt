Title: Truffes Pralinees (Praline Truffles)
Categories: Chocolate, Candy, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
3 oz Butter
1 1/2 oz Praline paste
1/2 lb Good chocolate
About 1/2 glass water
3    Egg yolks
Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil,
remove from the fire, and add the yolks, beating with a spatula, then
replace on a low fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop
beating. Remove from the fire and add the butter and the praline
paste. Let cool, beating from time to time (this cooling takes a
rather long time). When the mixture begins to solidify, take some
with a spoon, place it in some grated chocolate (prepared in
advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These truffles keep a
week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable shortening for the
butter.
