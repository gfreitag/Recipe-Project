STORING AND FREEZING COOKIES: 1). Separate soft and crisp textured
cookies for storage. Soft cookies should be kept in tightly covered
containers. Crisp cookies may be stored in a cookie jar or container
with loose fitting lid in a dry climate. In humid climate, store
crisp cookies in a tightly covered container.
2). If soft cookies begin to dry out, add a piece of apple or bread
to the container to help them retain moisture. If crisp cookies
become soggy and are not decorated, heat in a 300~ oven for 3-5
minutes to crisp them.
3). Store frosted cookies and thumb print cookies in a single layer
in a tightly covered container. If need be for space, layer cookies
between waxed paper to protect.
4). Bar cookies may be stored, tightly covered, in baking pan. Some
may require refrigeration because of ingredients in them.
5). Unbaked cookie dough can be refrigerated for up to one week or
frozen for up to 6 weeks. Rolls of dough should be sealed tightly in
plastic wrap; other doughs should be stored in airtight containers.
6). Crisp cookies freeze better than soft cookies. Bars and brownies
are an exception to this rule since they freeze extremely well.

7). Freeze unfrosted cookies from 9-12 months. Separate layers with
waxed paper or plastic wrap.
8). Freeze frosted cookies uncovered until they are firm. Then pack
them in airtight container lined with plastic wrap or foil. They can
be frozen for 2-3 months.
9). Cardboard containers are not recommended for storage as the
flavor and aroma from the box may be absorbed by the cookies.
10). Frozen cookies thaw in about 10 minutes at room temperature.
