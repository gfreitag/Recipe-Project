"This recipe has been in the family since my great grandmother begun
making it as a frugal jam for her family. Generations of
Loewen/Howard women have made it as a mainstay of family breakfasts.
My father particularly enjoyed the jam, but with a family of three
sons, there seemed to be no one to carry on the tradition. That
changed however, when my brother presented my father with a year's
supply of tomato jam one Christmas. These are, after all, the 90s."

Halve and seed orange and lemon. In food processir, finely shop fruit
with rind. Transfer to heavy saucepan; add tomatoes and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until rind is tender.
Stir in pectin. Return to boil; boil for 1 minute, stirring. Stir in
sugar; bring to a full rolling boil. Boil, stirring, for 1 minute.
Remove from heat and skim off foam. Pour into hot sterlized jars,
leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Seal jars; process in boiling water bath
for 10 minutes. Store in cool, dark, dry place. MAKES: ABOUT 5 CUPS
