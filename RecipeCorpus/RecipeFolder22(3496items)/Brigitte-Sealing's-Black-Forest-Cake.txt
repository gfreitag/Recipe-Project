MMMMM--------------------FILLING AND TOPPING-------------------------

3/4 pt Fresh double cream
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 tb Powdered sugar

2 1/2    - 3 1/2 oz Sugar
4 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Cherry spirits
2 ts White ground gelatine
For the pastry bottom:

1. Mix together flour, cocoa, and baking powder; make a hole in the
middle and pour in sugar and egg white, and mix until it is a thick
paste. Cut the margarine in little blocks, and put them in the mid-
dle and voer with a little flour and knead it all quickly with hands
into a smooth, firm paste. If it is sticky, put it in the
refrigerator for a short time. Grease the base of a 10" round
cakepan, roll out the pastry to fit. Preheat oven for 5 minutes on
VERY HOT (425F) and then reduce heat to 350F and bake for 20 minutes.

For the Sponge Cake Mixture:

1. Whisk the egg yolks with the water until frothy, then add 2/3 of
the sugar, a little at a time, and continue whisking until the mix-
ture is creamy and thick. Add the flavorings and the cinnamon. Whisk
the eggwhites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form and gradually
whisk in the rest of the sugar. Pour the egg white mixture over the
egg yolk mixture. Mix the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and
sift over the egg white mixture. Fold all together very gently (DO
NOT STIR OR BEAT). Line a round cakepan bottom, the same size as the
pastry, with wax paper. Fill with the sponge mixture and bake
immediately in a moderate oven (350F) for 30-35 minutes.

For the Filling and Topping:

1. Pour the cherries through a sieve, and collect the juice. Measure
juice off to 1/2 pint, and if necessary fill up with water to make
1/2 pint, and blend 4 T. of the juice with the cornstarch. Bring the
rest of the juice to a boil, and remove from heat. Stir in the
prepared cornstarch, return to heat, and boil up briefly. Mix in the
cherries and put aside to cool When cold, sweeten to taste with the
sugar and the cherry spirits. Blend the gelatine with water and set
aside for 10 minutes to swell. Stir over low heat until gelatine is
almost completely dissolved, then cool. Whip the cream until almost
thick, then add the lukewarm gelatine mixture and the powdered sugar,
continue whisking until it is quite stiff.

2. Spread 1/2 of the cherry mix and 1/2 of the cream over the pastry
layer base. Cut the sponge through once horizontally and lay one half
on the pastry base. Press well. Cover with the rest of the cherry
filling and 1/2 of the remaining cream. Cover this with the other
half of the sponge cake and pile the rest of the whipped cream on
top. Sprinkle with the grated chocolate. Cool well before cutting.
