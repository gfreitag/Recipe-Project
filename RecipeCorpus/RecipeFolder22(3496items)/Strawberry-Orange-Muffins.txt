Preheat an oven to 400~.  Butter standard muffin tins. In a large
bowl stir and toss together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and
salt. Set aside.  In a medium bowl whisk together the sugar, milk,
sour cream, oil, egg and orange zest until mixed; stir in the
strawberries. Add to the combined dry ingredients and stir just until
blended. Place a spoonful of batter in each prepared muffin cup. Top
each with a scant teaspoon of strawberry jam. Spoon the remaining
batter over the jam, filling each cup about two-thirds full.  Bake
until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin comes out
clean, 15-18 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then remove.
