Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon.  It is cured with salt and
is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a large salami.  Widely used
in Italian cooking, especially in Emilia-Romagna, it is vital to many
dishes. If available, buy a large quantity, cut into several pieces
and freeze it. You can substitute domestic bacon for pancetta. It
must be blanched in boiling water for two to three minutes to reduce
the smoky flavour. Fresh side pork can can also be used. Melt butter
with oil in a large saucepan. When the butter foams, add onion,
carrot, celery and pancetta. Saute over medium heat until lightly
browned. Add veal. Cook and stir until meat is no longer pink.
Season with salt and pepper.  Increase heat and stir in wine. Cook
until wine has evaporated.  Press tomatoes (one 28 oz. can crushed
Italian-style tomatoes) through food mill or sieve, to remove seeds
and skin.  Stir tomato pulp into veal mixture. Cover and reduce heat.
Simmer 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until sauce reaches a medium-thick
consistency. Stir occasionally during cooking. Add Milk and cook 5
minutes longer. Makes 2-1/2 to 3 cups of sauce.
