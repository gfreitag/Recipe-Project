1 1/4 lb Potatoes, peeled and

As watercress changes potato soup into something that doesn't taste
quite like any of the individual ingredients, so arugula transforms
this traditional soup base.

Flexible, the soup can be pureed to a chunky or a smooth texture, and
served hot, as a main dish, or chilled, as a first course.

About 10 oz arugula, washed, trimmed, to yield 4 c packed Pepper and
salt, as needed About 2 Tb Ricard or Pernod Yogurt, about 2 Tb per
serving Garnish: 4 arugula leaves, finely slivered

Heat oil in large pot.  Add leeks and onion; cook over moderately low
heat, stirring often, until softened, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with
fennel and stir for 30 seconds.

Add potatoes, broth, and water.  Simmer for 25 minutes, until soft.
Add arugula and cook for about 10 minutes longer, or until stems are
soft. Add salt, pepper and liquor to taste.

Puree to rough or smooth texture, as you like.  Adjust seasoning.
Serve hot or chilled, topped with yogurt and garnished with arugula
slivers.
