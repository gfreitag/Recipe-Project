Title: Potato Soup with Kale and Bacon
Categories: Vegetable, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper
1 c  Heavy cream
1 bn Chives (optional)
5 ts Balsamic vinegar
2 lb Boiling potatoes
3/4 lb Bacon
1 bn Kale (about 1 pound)
1    Clove garlic
Peel the potatoes and put in a pot with enough cold, salted water to
cover. Cover and bring to a boil.  Lower heat, uncover, and simmer
until done, about 25 minutes.  Drain, reserving the cooking liquid.
Break up potatoes with a potato masher; they should be lumpy, not
smooth.

Cook the bacon until crisp.  Drain and chop.  Pour off all but 2
tablespoons of the bacon fat, reserving the extra fat.

Stem and chop the kale.  Mince the garlic.  Cook half the kale and
half the garlic in the 2 tablespoons bacon fat over medium heat until
kale is wilted, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper and
transfer to a bowl.  Repeat with remaining kale and garlic, using the
reserved bacon fat as needed.  Return all the kale to the frying pan
and add the heavy cream. Simmer over low heat until the kale is
tender, about 10 minutes. Mince the chives.  (Recipe can be made to
this point several hours ahead.)

Cooking and Serving:  Combine potatoes with about 4 cups of the
reserved cooking liquid in a large pot.  Add more cooking liquid or
water if too thick.  Add kale mixture to the pot and bring to a
simmer.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour into bowls and
sprinkle with chives and bacon.

Yield: 4 servings.
