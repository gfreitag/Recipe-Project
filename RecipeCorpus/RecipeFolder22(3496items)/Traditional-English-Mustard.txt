Title: Traditional English Mustard
Categories: Spread
Yield: 12 servings

Mustard loses potency if heated therefore the traditional recipe
calls for COLD water. Mix mustard powder and cold water in
proportions to make a smooth paste but only enough for current use.
Let stand for at least 10 minutes before serving to allow the enzymes
to develop. Serve: with beef, ham, cheese and sausages.
