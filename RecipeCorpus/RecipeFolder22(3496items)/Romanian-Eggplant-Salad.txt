Title: Romanian Eggplant Salad
Categories: Vegetable, Salad
Yield: 21 servings   1 1/2 tsp sea salt, or more to taste 1/3 cup safflower oil 1/4 cup
extra-virgin olive oil 1 Tbsp milk 1 fresh tomato, sliced 15 Greek
black olives 1/4 cup chopped onion

Roast each eggplant, turning frequently, over a flame or under a
broiler, until the skin is charred all over, 20 to 25 minutes.  Using
a sharp knife, peel the eggplants and rinse thoroughly under cold
water.  Quarter the eggplants lengthwise and discard as many seeds as
possible. Toss with 1 tsp sea salt, then place the eggplants in a
stainless-steel or other non-aluminum colander and squeeze out as
much water as possible. Allow to drain in the colander for 30
minutes. Blot up any excess moisture with paper towels.
Cut the eggplant flesh into 1 1/2 inch cubes.  Place the cut
eggplant in a glass or ceramic bowl and, stirring continuously with a
wooden spoon, slowly add the safflower and olive oils and remaining
1/2 tsp sea salt.
