Cut off the ends of cucumbers. Cut each cucumber widthwise into 6
pieces and turn pieces so they are flat. With a melon baller or
grapefruit spoon, gently scoop out some flesh from the top of each
cucumber.

IN a food preocessor or blender, make hummus by combining garbanzos,
oil, water, lemon juice and salt.
Puree, ading more water if needed for creaminess. Stir in
blackolives and spoon mixture into the hollowed out part of each
cucumber. Place on a serving tray. Makes 12 appetizers.

Helpful hints:

Use California black olives for a mild taste, or Greek black olvies
for a more pungent flavor.

Hummus can be made up to a week in advance. Filled rounds can be
prepared up to two days in advance but are best assembled immediately
before serving.

Keep cucumbers covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
