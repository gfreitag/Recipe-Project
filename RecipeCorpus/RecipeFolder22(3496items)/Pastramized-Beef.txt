Title: Pastramized Beef
Categories: Meat, Can/preserv, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Salt
4 T  Black pepper; freshly ground
3 T  Mixed whole pickling spice
6 lb Beef brisket
1 t  Saltpeter
2 T  Brown sugar; firmly packed
3 t  Ginger; ground
Mix the Salt, Saltpeter, spices and Sugar together and then rub into
the Beef forcing it into the meat. Set into a pan, cover closely, and
put into the refrigerator or a very cool place.  Turn every few days
for 3 weeks, then smoke over a barbecue pit or in a smokehouse --
over very low heat for 4 hours.  It will keep well for some time in a
cool place. To prepare, cover with cold Water and cook until tender.
The length of cooking time depends on how long it was smoked.  A
large goose may be also treated this way to make a delicious treat.
