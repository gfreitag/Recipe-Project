Mexican Chocolate Cake

Confectioners' Sugar

Line the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan with waxed paper. Lightly
grease the wased paper and side of pan.  Melt the chocolate and cool
to room temperature.  In a large bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat
the egg yolks.  Graduly add sugar and beat until light about 4
minutes. Add mayonnaise and beat for 1 minute longer. Stir in the
ground almonds and flour until blended. Stir in Kahlus. In a medium
bowl, using clean beater, beat egg whites until stiff and fold into
the batter. Pour mixture into the prepared pan.  Bake at 350 for 55
min. or until firm.

Cool the cake in the pan on a wir rack for 10 minutes.  Remove the
side of the pan and cool the cake 30 minutes longer. Invert onto a
wire rack and remove bottom of pan and waxed paper.  Cool completely.
Sprinkle with confectionr's sugar you might try using a geometric
patter made from paper to create an interesting design instead of the
old doilie trick. Hope this is it. Emily Jorge
