Categories: Vegetarian, Soup/stew, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
3 md Boiling potatoes; cut into
-1/2-inch thick slices
1 cn Unsweetened tomatoes in
-puree (28 oz)
1 c  Vegetable stock
1/8 ts Red pepper flakes; crushed
1/2 c  Fresh basil; chopped, OR
1 ts Dried basil
1 c  Mediterranean black olives;
-pitted and chopped
1 lg Eggplant; peeled and cut
-into 1-inch cubes
1 1/2 tb Fine sea salt
3 tb Olive oil or more as needed
1 md Onion; chopped
2    Celery ribs, with leaves;
-chopped
1    Green bell pepper; seeded
-and chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
Place the eggplant in a colander and toss with 1 teaspoon of the
salt. Let stand for 1 hour to draw out the bitter juices. Rinse well,
drain and pat dry with kitchen towels.

Heat 2 tbs of the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the
eggplant and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 4
minutes. (You may have to add a little more oil if the eggplant
sticks). Transfer to a plate and set aside.

Heat the remaining 2 tbs oil in the pan, and add the onion, celery,
bell pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about
5 minutes. Stir in the reserved eggplant, the potatoes, the tomatoes
with their puree, vegetable stock, the remaining 1/2 tsp salt, and
the red pepper flakes; if using dried basil, add it now. Bring to a
simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring
occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes to 1
hour.

Stir in the olives and, if using, the fresh basil, and continue
cooking to blend the flavors, about 5 minutes. Serve the stew hot,
warm or at room temperature.
