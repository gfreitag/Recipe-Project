Heat 1/4 cup olive ol in a large heavy frying pan; add onions and
sweet peppers and cook over very low heat until vegetables are quite
tender and slightly caramellized, about 35 to 45 minutes. Stir in
garlic and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 5 minutes longer.

Combine the remaining olive oil, lemon juice, Italian spices, and
salt and pepper to taste. Whisk and reserve.

Cook pasta in 4 quarts boiling water until al dente.
Drain and rinse well in cold water, then drain again.
With a sharp knife, diagonally slice each piece of pasta in half
crosswise. Toss in a large bowl with onion mixture and reserve
dressing.

Toss eggplant cubes and chopped basil with pasta.
Garnish with basil leaves.

Serves 6 to 8 as a first course, 10 to 12 as a salad.
Good side dish with barbecued tofu.
