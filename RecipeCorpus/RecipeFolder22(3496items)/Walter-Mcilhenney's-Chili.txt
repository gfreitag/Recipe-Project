TABASCO CLASSIC: Walter McIlhenny was very fond of homemade chili and
liked to serve his version to former Marine Corps buddies who visited
him on the island.
~---------------------------------------------------------------------
~-- In a 5-quart Dutch oven or heavy saucepan, heat the oil over
medium-high heat.  In three batches, brown the beef well, removing
each batch with a slotted spoon.  Set aside.

Add the onion and garlic to the pot and cook for 5 minutes, or until
tender, stirring frequently.  Stir in the chili powder, cumin, salt,
and Tabasco sauce; cook for 1 minute.  Add the water and chilies;
bring to a boil.  Return the beef to the pot.  Reduce the heat and
simmer uncovered, 1-1/2 hours, or until the beef is tender.  Serve
the chili over rice with onion, cheese and sour cream, if desired.
