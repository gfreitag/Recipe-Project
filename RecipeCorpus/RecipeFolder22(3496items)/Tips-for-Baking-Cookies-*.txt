BAKING COOKIES: 1). Bake only one baking sheet at a time in oven for
best results. If cookies brown unevenly, rotate the baking sheet from
front to back halfway through baking. If you do use more than one
baking sheet at a time, switch them halfway through baking. Space
oven racks 6" apart.
2). Make sure baking sheets do not touch sides or back of oven.
3). Allow baking sheets to cool between batches. Dough will spread
on warm baking sheets.
4). For bar cookies, rack should be in center of oven.
5). Watch cookies carefully to avoid overbaking. Check them at the
minimum baking time, then often to make sure they do not overbake. It
is generally better to underbake than overbake.
6). Most cookies should be removed from baking sheets as soon as
they come from the oven. Use a wide spatula to keep them from
breaking.
7). Cool bar cookies in pan on wire rack.
8). Most cookies should be removed from cookie sheets immediately
after baking. Cool on waxed paper or paper towels. Only use wire
racks to cool cookies that are firm. If cookies stick to pan before
you can remove them, return to oven for a few seconds to warm them
for easier removal.
