Title: Brenda's Black Bean Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
-tangerine
1 tb Vinegar (if you used a sweet
-orange or tangerine)
1    Stick oleo
2 tb Of flour
3 c  Dried black beans
2    Ham hocks
1    Bell pepper (chopped)
1 sm Onion (chopped)
1    Whole sour orange or
Tried out the "White Trash Cookbook" last night and whipped up this
black bean soup. In spite of the fact that I forgot to finish it with
the browned flour and butter, it turned out pretty darn good, if a
tad bland. (I did cheat and use real butter instead of oleo.) Here's
the recipe. Never having had black bean soup before, let alone making
it, I'm not sure what would be kosher to liven it up a bit. Anyone
have any tips? I served it with cornbread and a plate of sliced home
grown tomatoes. BTW, the recipe is transcribed exactly as it appears
in the book to give a taste of Mickler's writing style. Pretty neat
stuff, though I'm not sure if I'm ready for the cold collard sandwich
yet...

Salt and pepper to taste

Put your beans in a soup pot and cover with water. Boil, take off the
fire and let sit until cool. Cook onions and bell peppers in 1/2 the
oleo until limp. Add them and the ham hocks and orange to the cooled
beans; cover charitably with water. Simmer until beans is soft (1 to
2 hours). Fish out the orange right now, before it gets tore up. With
the rest of the oleo, brown the flour in a black frying pan, then
stir it into the beans. Brenda says: "Make sure you got a soup, now.
If you need to add some more water, do it."
