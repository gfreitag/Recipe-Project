PREPARING COOKIES: 1). Read the entire recipe before beginning to
make sure you have everything needed.
2). Measure all ingredients accurately and assemble in order given in
recipe.
3). Prepare pans according to recipe directions. Use only solid
shortening or margarine for greasing pans.
4). Cookie sheets with little or no sides will allow cookies to bake
quickly and evenly. Aluminum or teflon coated pans give the best
results. Dark metal pans cause cookies to have an undesirable dark
crust.
5). Adjust racks and preheat oven about 10 minutes before you begin
baking cookies.
6). Easy does it when adding flavorings and colorings to cookie
dough. Pour mixtures into measuring spoon away from batter in bowl so
if excess spills out it will not ruin the dough.
7). Use standard measuring cups for all dry ingredients. Use glass or
plastic liquid measuring cups with pouring spout to measure liquid
ingredients. Place the cup on a flat surface, fill to desired mark and
check at eye level.
8). Use standard measuring spoonsto measure, not eating or serving
spoons. For dry ingredients, fill spoons to overflowing and level off
with straight edge of metal spatula or knife.
9). Lightly spoon flour into correct measuring cup and then level it
off. Do not tap or bang the cup nor dip it into the flour. This will
pack the flour, giving more than needed. Too much flour will make dry
cookies.
