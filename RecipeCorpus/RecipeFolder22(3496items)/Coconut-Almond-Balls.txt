Title: Coconut Almond Balls
Categories: Candy, Chocolate, Microwave
Yield: 26 servings
-pieces
1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
26    Whole natural almonds (1-oz)
4 c  (8 1/2-oz) shredded coconut
-(fresh package!)
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
1 pk (11 1/2-oz) milk chocolate
Tastes just like Almond Joy.

Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling
rack on paper; set aside.

Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.

Place corn syrup in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1
minute or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm
syrup into coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is
thoroughly coated. This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough
syrup.

Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by
squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between
both palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into
balls.) Place 2 inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes.
Reroll coconut balls so there are no loose ends of coconut sticking
up.

Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4-cup glass measure or 1 1/2
quart microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until
mixture can be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice.

Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate
over each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting
excess chocolate drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating
is still soft, lightly press whole almond on top of each. Let stand
to set or place in refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight
container. Keeps best if refrigerated. Makes 26.
