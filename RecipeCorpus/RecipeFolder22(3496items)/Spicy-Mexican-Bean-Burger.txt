Title: Spicy Mexican Bean Burger
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1/8 c  Picante sauce or salsa
1 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Black pepper or to taste
Dash of chili powder
16 oz Canned red kidney beans,
Drained and mashed
1/2 sm Onion, coarsely chopped
1/2    Green pepper, coarsely ch.
1    Carrot, steamed, mashed
Mix all ingredients together. Add more flour to create a firmer
mixture, or more salsa if mixture is too stiff. Form into balls and
smash into patties. Bake at 450 degrees for 15-20 minutes, until
firm, brown and done. Serve on a whole wheat bun with lettuce, tomato
and salsa. Accompany with tortilla chips and a large glass of iced
tea. These can be grilled or pressed in those new=fangled sandwich
presses... a lot quicker and tastier than baking.
