Title: Rosemary's Root Beer Tonic
Categories: Beverage
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 oz Ground Ginger
1/2 oz Ground Cinnamon
1/4 oz Orange Peel, dried
3 oz Sassafras Bark, dried
2 oz Sarsaparilla, dried
1 oz Dandelion Root, dried
1 oz Burdock Root, dried
This sweet, bracing drink from Rosemary Gladstar Slick is reminiscent
of old-fashioned root beer, due to the sassafras.  It has a cleansing,
revivifying effect from the dandelion, burdock and sarsaparilla.

Mix together all ingredients and store in a tightly closed container.
In a large pot combine 1 quart of water and 4 tablespoons of dry
mixture. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
Strain and sweeten with honey or stevia (also called "sweet herb") if
desired.

Makes about 4 cups

Variation:  For iced tea, chill the simmered mixture, then dilute it
with 1 quart of sparkling water.  Serve over ice with a twist of
orange peel.
