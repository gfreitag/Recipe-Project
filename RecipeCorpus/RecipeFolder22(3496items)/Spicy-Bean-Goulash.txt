Heat the oil in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion in the oil
for 4 to 5 minutes or until soft. Add the garlic, chile, peppers and
mushrooms and cook for five minutes. Cover and cook the mixture for
15-20 minutes over a very gentle heat.

Add the cooked beans, potato, paprika, thyme, tomato puree and miso
to the stew.

Simmer gently for 30 minutes, adding a little bean liquid if
necessary. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot with rice or
noodles. Serves four.
