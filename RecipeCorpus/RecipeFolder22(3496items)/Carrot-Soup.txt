Carrot Soup

Place carrots, stock, salt and potato in a saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Cover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.

Saute onions and garlic in a little butter or margarine, until the
onions are clear.

Puree everything in the food processor until smooth.  (I did it in two
batches in the food processor.)

Return to the kettle, c ?????? add the nuts, and then whisk in the
yogurt. Heat very slowly. Add the sherry and heat a little longer.

This is quite good.

It makes about 4 hearty servings.
