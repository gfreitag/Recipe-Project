Categories: Muffin, Bread, Side dish
Yield: 12 servings
3 lg Carrots; peeled and grated
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder

-ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Light brown sugar; packed
3    Eggs
1 tb Lemon juice
1/3 c  -water
Set the oven at 350 degrees.  Grease a muffin tin that will hold 12
large muffins.

In a bowl of an electric mixer, beat the oil, brown sugar, eggs, lemon
juice and water together.  Add the carrots and mix well.

Stir in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon,
mixing only until the dry ingredients are moistened. Fill the
prepared muffin cups by evenly distributing the batter.

Bake in a preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until it's golden
brown and springs back lightly to the touch. Remove from the oven.
These are best eaten hot and may be reheated if you are taking them
to someone's house.

ELAINE'S NOTE:  These muffins are no relation to carrot cake but are
rather more like a popover in the shape of a muffin. They are meant
to be eaten as a savory side dish to the turkey.
