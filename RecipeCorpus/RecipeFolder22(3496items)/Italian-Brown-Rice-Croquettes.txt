2 c  ;water

2    Garlic cloves; minced
1/2 lb Tofu, firm; crumbled
1 c  Vegetable stock
1/4 c  Oats, rolled
3 tb Soy sauce
1 c  Parsley, fresh; finely
In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium-high
heat. Add the rice, cover, and return to the boil. Immediately reduce
the heat to low and simmer until the water is absorbed, 30 to 40
minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the
celery, onion, garlic and cook, until softened, about 6 minutes.
Transfer to a large bowl.

Put the tofu, vegetable stock, oats and soy sauce in a blender and
blend until smooth. Add the parsley, basil, balack pepper, and
cayenne and pulse until blended. Add to the onion mixture.

Add the cooked rice to the onion mixture, along with the whole wheat
bread crumbs and olives, and mix well.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil a baking sheet.

Shape the rice mixture into 2-inch balls (about 1/2 cup) for a main
dish or 1-inch balls (about 1/8 cup) for an appetizer. Roll each ball
in the Herbed Bread Crumbs, patting to make the crumbs adhere, and
put the croquettes on the baking sheet. Bake until lightly browned,
20 to 30 minutes.

Arrange the croquettes on a serving platter and serve the Nutty Basil
Pesto on the side.
