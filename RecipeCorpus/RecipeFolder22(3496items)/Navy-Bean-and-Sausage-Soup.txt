Soak the navy beans overnight in plenty of cold water; the next day
drain the beans and rinse them under cool water.  Set aside.  Place
the oil and onion in a soup kettle, set over low heat and cook slowly
until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes.  Increase the heat to
medium, add the garlic and celery and stir-cook for 1 minute.  Drop
in the bay leaf and parsley bundle.  Stir in the allspice, red pepper
flakes, broth, and navy beans. Bring the soup base to a boil,
skimming it as necessary; boil 3 minutes. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2
hours, or until the beans are quite tender. Discard the parsley-bay
leaf bundle.  (The soup may be prepared in advance to this point.)

To finish the soup, grill the sausages under the broiler or pan-fry
them for about 20 minutes, letting them cook for 10 minutes on each
side. Slice the sausage into 1/3-inch disks.  Add the sausage rounds
to the soup and let simmer for 5 minutes longer to blend the flavors.
Season with salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste.  Ladle the soup
into warm bowls and serve piping hot.

Makes 5 servings.
