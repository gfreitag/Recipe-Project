2 ts Baking powder
3    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Milk or buttermilk
1 qt Blueberries; rinsed,
- picked over and dried
1 c  Unsalted butter; softened
1 1/2 c  Sugar

1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Butter a 12-by-18-inch jelly roll pan and
line the bottom with a sheet of parchment or waxed paper. In a large
mixer bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft and light. Add the
eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the
vanilla. Sift together the flour and baking powder and stir into the
batter in three additions, alternating with the yolks and milk,
beginning and ending with the flour. Spread the batter evenly in the
prepared pan. Scatter the blueberries evenly over the batter,
pressing them in gently.

FOR THE CRUMBS: MIX THE FLOUR, SUGARS, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl.
Melt the butter and stir it in evenly. Rub the mixture to coarse
crumbs by hand. Scatter the crumbs over the berries as evenly as
possible. Bake the cake about 40 minutes until batter is firm and
crumbs are well-colored. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack. Cut the
cooled cake into 24 3-inch squares. Remove the squares from the pan
to a platter.

VARIATIONS: Substitute 4 cups pitted sour cherries for the
blueberries.
