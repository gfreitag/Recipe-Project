Title: Apricot Fritters
Categories: Bread, Fruit, Dessert
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Water; plus
1 tb Water
3 tb Melted butter
1 1/2 qt Vegetable oil; for frying
Confectioners' sugar
12 sm Apricots; -=OR=-
6 lg -Apricots, halved
12    Whole almonds
2 tb White rum
1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 c  Cornstarch
3 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
RINSE THE APRICOTS, slit the sides and remove the pits with a small
spoon, leaving the apricots intact. Replace each pit with an almond.
Place the apricots in a bowl and sprinkle the slit sides with the
rum. For the batter, combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk
in the water, then the melted butter. Pour the oil into a 4-quart pan
and heat it to 350F. With a fork, dip the apricots into the batter
and add to the hot oil 3 or 4 at a time, frying them about 6 or 7
minutes, until the batter is a deep golden and the apricots are
cooked, but still firm. Drain the fritters on absorbent paper as they
are fried and keep them warm in a 300F oven. To serve, sprinkle the
fritters generously with confectioners' sugar.
