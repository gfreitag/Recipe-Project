1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Honey or sugar
1 ts Mustard
1/2 ts Salt
1 lb Tofu
1/2 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
1/2 c  Raw cashews
1 c  Rice, nut, or soy milk
2 tb Margarine or butter
Mix all ingredients in blender on high until smooth. Then just
heat in saucepan and serve over your favorite vegetable.

You could also add some chili powder and a dash of cayanne
pepper (if you like it a bit spicey) and serve over nacho chips.

It's also great on pizza, as a bread spread, in quiche, in
layered casseroles, in lasagna, fondue...use your imagination.

You may omitt either the cashews or the yeast flakes (but not
both) and still have a yummy cheese-type sauce. I enjoy it best with
both but when I'm out of one of those I go ahead and omitt it.

You may also substitute 1 1/2 more cups of the milk for the Tofu
if you don't have any.  Just thicken it with cornstarch when you heat
it.
