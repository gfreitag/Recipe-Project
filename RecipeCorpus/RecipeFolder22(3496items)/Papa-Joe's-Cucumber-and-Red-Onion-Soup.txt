This is from Alice Brock at Alice's Restaurant.  Yes, THAT one.

Peel and slice cucumbers as thin as you can.  Peel and slice red
onions thin as you can.  (It's easier if you cut the onion in half
and slice cut side down)

Use a deep 1 gallon bowl or crock.  Alternate layers of cukes and
onions with sprinkles of the salt and sugar between each layer.  This
will draw out the juices that make it soup.  Pile sour cream on top.
DO NOT STIR. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours or more.

To serve, add the fresh dill weed and lemon juice and stir it up. Add
more lemon juice or sugar to taste.

Cool and refreshing, this is just perfect when it is too hot to cook,
and cucumbers are running wild.
