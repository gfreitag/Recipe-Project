Title: Coconut Fudge
Categories: Dessert, Candy
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Vinegar, optional
1/8 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Coconut, shredded, moist
3 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Syrup, corn, light
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Molasses
Combine sugar, corn syrup, milk, molasses vinegar (if using) and
salt in a heavy pan.  Stir over medium heat until the sugar is
dissolved. Bring to a boil and cook, covered, for about 3 minutes
until the steam has washed down from the sides of the pan any
crystals that may have formed.

Uncover and cook slowly to the soft-ball stage (238 F. on candy
thermometer) without stirring.  Remove from heat and stir in shredded
coconut and butter.  Pour candy on to a buttered platter.  When cool
enough to handle, shape into small balls and place them on foil to
dry.

Yield:  about 1 1/2 pounds of candy
