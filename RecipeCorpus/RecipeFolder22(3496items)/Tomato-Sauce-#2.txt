Title: Tomato Sauce #2
Categories: Vegetarian, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
6 oz Tomato paste
28 oz Tomatoes, canned or fresh;
-chopped
1 c  ;water
Salt and pepper
2 ts Olive oil, cold pressed
1/2    Onion; finely chopped
1/2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Marjoram
2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
1. Place the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion, basil, oregano,
and marjoram and cook, covered, over medium heat until the onion is
golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Remove the onion
and garlic and reserve. 2. Place the tomato paste in the same
saucepan and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.

3. Add the canned tomatoes and mash wiht a fork or potato masher. If
you prefer a creamier sauce, blend the tomatoes in a blender until
smooth. Add the water and bring to a fast boil.

4. Reduce the heat. Add the reserved onion, garlic, salt and pepper.
Simmer, covered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Note: for a thick sauce (if sauce is to be used for pizza), cook,
uncovered, during the last half hour, stirring often to prevent
burning.
