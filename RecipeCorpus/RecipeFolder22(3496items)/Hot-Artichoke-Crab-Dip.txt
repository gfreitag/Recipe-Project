These dashes are then put into MM as extra ingredients lines starting
with the dashes as if it is reading them as a two column ingredient
list. Have you had this happen to you, and if so is there a way to
prevent it from happening? I'm asking you because you seem to be an
expert on these conversion programs. I can delete them fairly easily
but that is a pain.

I hope it's OK to ask this here.

Thanks,
