Filling:  Precook grains in water until done.  Crush tofu. Saute
remaining ingredients in oil until cooked and add cooked grains.

Sauce:  Season tomato sauce with remaining ingredients.

Cabbage: Core cabbage and cook in boiling water for several minutes.
Pull leaves away as they soften.  Cut out hard core of leaf. Cut
largest leaves in half.

Preheat oven to 300.  Oil 9"x13" casserole.  Place enough tomato
sauce to cover bottom.  Fill cabbage leaves with cooked filling and
wrap, tucking sides and ends in to form neat rolls. Place rolls
snugly in casserole against each other. Spoon remaining sauce over.
Cover tightly and bake 2 hours. Leave in oven until serving time.

Sylvia's comments: I thought the original filling looked way too
bland, so I modified it quite heavily and stirred in some sauce as
well. I also doubled the recipe (thank goodness for Meal Master!) and
now have a large amount of filling tucked in the freezer for future
use. I made the sauce up in small batches, since I didn't have a huge
kitchen; the "remaining batches" header is so the amounts on the MM
shopping list will be correct. And I used part of the filling for
stuffed peppers, which were pronounced absolutely delicious by a
non-vegetarian. (He didn't ask what the ingredients were, and I
didn't tell him it was vegetarian. <g>)
