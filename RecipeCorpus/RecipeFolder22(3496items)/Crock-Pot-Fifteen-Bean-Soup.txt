Title: Crock-Pot Fifteen-Bean Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable, Pork
Yield: 4 servings
1    Bay leaf
1 ds Cayenne pepper
Ground pepper to taste
1 pk Polska kielbasa, sliced into
-coins (we prefer turkey
-kielbasa)
1 pk (20 oz) 15-bean soup mix
-(throw away the flavor
-packet!)
1 lg Onion, chopped
1 ts Garlic
1 ts Celery salt
2    Stalks chopped celery
Soak beans overnight, changing water frequently.  Drain.  In crock-
pot, cover beans with 1 inch water.  Add all other ingredients except
kielbasa. Cover and cook on high for one hour; turn to low and cook
overnight. Stir once or twice during cooking.  One hour before
serving, check the texture of the soup.  If it's too thin, mash some
of the beans with a potato masher.  Add sliced kielbasa.  Cook for
one hour.  Serve with Tabasco sauce and bread or rice.

Serves 4 generously.

NOTE:  This soup freezes well.  Leftovers are excellent (usually
thicker from reheating), and are delicious served over rice.
