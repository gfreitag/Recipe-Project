Title: Green Tomato Frittata
Categories: Vegetable, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian, Tomato
Yield: 6 servings
3    Basil leaves
- torn or finely sliced
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 lb Firm green tomatoes (approx)
Cornmeal or flour
6    Eggs
3 tb Chopped scallions
SLICE THE TOMATOES into rounds a little less than 1/2-inch thick and
dredge them in the cornmeal or flour. Heat enough oil in a 10-inch
nonstick pan to cover the surface lightly and fry the tomatoes
briefly on each side, until they are lightly colored. Do not let them
get soft. Lightly beat the eggs with the scallions and basil and
season them with salt and pepper. Pour them over the tomatoes. Let
the eggs sit for about a minute, then give the pan a shake to loosen
the bottom. Cook over medium-low heat until the eggs are nicely
colored on the bottom, then slide the frittata out onto a large
plate. Place the pan over it, invert and return it to the heat to
cook the other side. Turn the frittata out onto a serving plate and
serve, hot or tepid, cut into wedges.
