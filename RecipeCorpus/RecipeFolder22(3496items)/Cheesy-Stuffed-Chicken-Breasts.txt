Categories: Poultry, Tex/mexican, Cheese/eggs, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 tb Chili powder
1/3 c  Flour
2 lg Eggs
1 c  Vegetable oil
Guacamole and/or salsa
4    Skinless, boneless chicken
-breast halves
(about 1 1/2 pounds)
1 1/2 c  Coarsely shredded Monterey
-Jack cheese with
Jalapeno peppers ( 8 ounces)
2 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
Place each chicken breast half between waxed paper and pound very
thin with a mallet or rolling pin to form a "cutlet".  Be careful not
to pound holes in the meat. Place 1/3 cup cheese in center of each
"cutlet"; sprinkle with oregano.  Fold sides over to seal cheese,
then roll up. Hold in place with wooden toothpick. Combine cornmeal
with chili powder on sheet of waxed paper; place flour on another.
Beat eggs slightly in a pie plate. Coat the stuffed rolls with flour;
dip in egg then cornmeal mixture to coat well. Chill at least an
hour. (This much of the preparation can be done ahead). Preheat oven
to 350 F. In a large skillet, heat oil until very hot. Quickly brown
the stuffed chicken rolls, turning often, until golden. Lift out with
a slotted spoon; drain well.  Place in a shallow baking pan. Bake 20
minutes or until juices run clear when pierced with a small knife.
Serve with guacamole and/or salsa.

Makes 4 servings.
