1.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over
moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes.
Add the asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes.  Add
the salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the
heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender,
about 15 minutes.

2.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce
the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very
slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs,
whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg
mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  Increase the heat to
moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just
thickens, about 8 minutes.  Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs
will curdle.  Remove from the heat.

3.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl.  Ladle the
hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.

Serves 6.

NOTE:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
day-old or slightly stale bread.  Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.
