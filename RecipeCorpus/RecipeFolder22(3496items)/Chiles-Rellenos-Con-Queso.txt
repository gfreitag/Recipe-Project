~- Prepare the tomato sauce and keep warm.  Cut as small a slit as
possible in one side of each chile to remove seeds.  Leave stems on.
Pat chiles dry with paper towels.  Cut cheese into long thin sticks,
one for each chile. Place one stick in each chile, using more if
chiles are large. If chiles are loose and open, wrap around cheese
and fasten with toothpicks. Pour oil 1/4" deep in a large skillet.
Heat oil to 365Ã¸F. Beat egg whites in a clean medium bowl with clean
beaters until stiff. Beat egg yolks lightly in a small bowl and fold
into beaten egg whites. Roll chiles in flour, then dip in egg mixture
to coat. Fry in hot oil until golden brown, turning with a spatula.
Drain on paper towels.  Serve immediately, topped with tomato sauce.
TOMATO SAUCE:  Combine tomatoes, onion and garlic in a blender or
food processor and puree.  Heat oil in a medium saucepan, add tomato
mixture.  Cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add broth, salt,
chiles, cloves and cinnamon.  Simmer gently for 15 minutes.
