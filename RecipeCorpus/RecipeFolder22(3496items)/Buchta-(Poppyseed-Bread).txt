beating until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks, and beat. Add
uyeast-milk mixture and heavy cream;blend. Sift together flour and
salt and add to egg yolk mixture. Knead until the dough no longer
sticks to your hands.(this can be done in a mixer with a dough hook
too.)Put the dough in a greased bowl, cover and let rise until
doubled in bulk. Divide dough into 7 balls. On a floured surface,
roll each ball into a rectangle 1/4" thick. Spread with your favorite
filling and roll up as you would a jelly roll. Place the rolls on a
greased cookie sheet(1 roll per pan), cover and let rise until
doubled. Bake at 325 F for 30 minutes. Filling: After you roll out
the dough, brush with melted butter then mix poppyseeds and sugar
together and spread over the dough. Drizzle with melted butter to
which some vanilla has been added and then roll up. From *Prodigy's
