Title: Yoghurt Sourdough Starter
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Natural plain yoghurt
1 c  White flour
NFXS18B
1 c  Low fat milk
Heat milk to 100F on thermometer. Remove from heat and stir in
yoghurt. Pour into scalded glass jar or bowl, cover with plastic and
place in a warm location for 18 hrs. Consistency will be like thin
yoghurt. Stir in flour until well blended, cover again with plastic
and pierce with fork to release gases. Place in a warm draft-free
location at an even 85F for 2 days; stir several times each day. It
should have a strong sourdough smell and show bubbles. Refrigerate
until ready to use. When replenishing starter, add lukewarm milk
instead of water.
