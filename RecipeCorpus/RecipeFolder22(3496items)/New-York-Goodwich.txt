florets. Place broccoli and cauliflower in vegetable steamer,
covered, over boiling water for 5 minutes or until vegetables are
tender when pierced with tip of sharp knife. Combine carrot, cabbage
and squash and mix thoroughly.

Prepare the barbecued onions, if desired.

Assemble the goodwich. In hot dry skillet, heat tortilla or chapati,
turning from one side to the other until soft but not crisp. Place on
large sheet of plastic wrap. If using pita, heat in oven for a few
minutes to soften it, and cut a sliver from top so pocket opens
easily. Combine all other ingredients; mix well, and stuff into
pocket.

Spread tortilla  with eggless mayo. Add a line of broccoli down
center. Crumble cauliflower and place aline of it on broccoli. Add a
line of pickle, a line of grated vegetables, a line of barbecued
onions. Top with lettuce, sprouts and avocado. Sprinkle with Spike if
desired.

Roll tortilla tightly, crepe-style, around vegetables.
Wrap tightly in plastic wrap until ready to serve.

This Goodwich will keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator. Cut it in
half and push plastic wrap partially down, but leave one end closed
to catch the drippy sauces.
