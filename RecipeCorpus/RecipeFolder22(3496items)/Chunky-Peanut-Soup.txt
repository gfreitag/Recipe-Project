1.  Melt the butter in a large stockpot over medium heat.  When it is
hot, add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring constantly, until
the onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.

2.  Meanwhile, mix 1 cup of the stock with the peanut butter in a
medium-sized bowl until smooth.

3.  Add the remaining 7 cups chicken stock to the vegetables.  Stir,
and add the tomato, potatoes, roasted pepper, and 2 Tablespoons of
the parsley. Pour in the peanut butter mixture, and stir.  Cover and
bring almost to a boil.  Simmer, partially covered, until the
potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes.  Then add the zucchini
and the mushrooms, stir, and continue cooking until the zucchini is
tender but still has texture, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the fish and
the peas, and cook until the fish is opaque and the peas are still
bright green, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the lemon juice, stir, and season
to taste with salt and cayenne pepper.

4.  Ladle the peanut soup into warmed soup bowls, garnish with the
remaining 1 Tablespoon parsley, and serve immediately.
