Title: Peanut Brittle
Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/4 c  Raw, shelled peanuts
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Vanilla extract or flavor
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
3 tb Unsalted butter
1) In heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup and water and bring
to a boil over med. heat, stirring. Wash down any crystals on sides
of pan with wet pastry brush. 2) Add the butter and cook over med.
high heat, without stirring, until candy thermometer reads 250 F. Add
nuts and cook, stirring, until mixture reaches 300 F. 3) While candy
is cooking, butter cookie sheet and metal spatula. 4) Remove candy
from heat. Stir in the salt, soda and vanilla, then spread the candy
as thin as possible on cookie sheet, using spatula. Cool sheet of
candy for few minutes, then turn it over on the cookie sheet with
spatula. 5) Stretch candy with your hands (wear gloves if necessary),
pulling firmly in all directions until it has at least doubled in
area and halved in thickness. Start with edges first, because they
cool fastest and get brittle first. Don't mind holes--candy will be
broken up anyway. 6) Cool candy completely, then break into pcs.
Store airtight. Will keep for months.
