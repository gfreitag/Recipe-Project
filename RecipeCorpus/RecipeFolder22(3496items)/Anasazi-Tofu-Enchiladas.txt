1/4 c  Chopped green onion
Mix first five ingredients together. Add 2 T. enchilada sauce.
Moisten tortillas in warmed enchilada sauce. Fill tortilla with
mixture and roll. Place in greased 6 1/2" X 10 1/2" pan with the

*  "Anasazi" is a Navajo word meaning "ancient one."  Anasazi beans
have been found in many southwestern Indian dwellings.  Bean
connoisseurs will appreciate the characteristic taste and texture
talents of pinto and kidney combined within this ancient Indian
entrant. Versatility of this variety is limited only by your
imagination: take them for a "dip": enlist them for creative Mexican
food construction: they even taste good straight!
