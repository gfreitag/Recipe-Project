The year 1989 marked the 100th anniversary of the Aunt Jemima
trademark. The name was conceived in 1889 by Chris Rutt while he was
attending a vaudeville show and watching a New Orleans-style dance
number performed to a jazzy tune called "Aunt Jemima."  Rutt liked
the music so much he stuck the name on his products.  The syrup came
along much later, in 1964, and is now the country's largest selling
syrup.
Today some folks tell the story of how their friends or
relatives one met Aunt Jemima many years ago and how she was a kind a
cordial woman. Little do they realize these people were fooled by a
promo. campaign for the broducts back in the 40's & 50's that used
actresses traveling from town to town dressed up and acting like the
"famous woman." There never really was an Aunt Jemima. ~--from "Top
