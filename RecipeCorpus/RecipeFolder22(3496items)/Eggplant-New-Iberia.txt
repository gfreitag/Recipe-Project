Eggplant is a favorite in Louisiana, where they fry it, smother it,
devil it, bake it and stuff it.  This versatile recipe makes a
delicious dip or spread.
~---------------------------------------------------------------------
~-- Preheat oven to 375oF.  Trim the ends off the eggplant and cut
the eggplant in half lengthwise.  Place the halves on a greased
baking sheet, cut side down.  Bake for 35 minutes, or until tender,
then cool and peel and dice.

In a large bowl, mix the eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, green onions and
parsley.  In a small bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients.
Pour the marinade over the vegetables and mix well.  Cover and let
stand for several hours to blend flavors.  Serve at room temperature.
Makes 1 quart.

Note:  To microwave the eggplant instead of baking it, place the
halves cut side down on a greased microwave-safe dish.  Cook on high
5 to 6 minutes, or until tender. From: The Tabasco Cookbook.  Typed
