Cactus looks forbidding. Stripped of its prickly points, however, it
is a mild-mannered vegetable with a slightly tart flavor. Look for
easy-to-use canned cactus (sold as NOPALES or NOPALITOS) in
supermarkets and Mexican groceries.

In a 4-5 quart pan over medium heat, stir oil and onion often until
onion is golden, about 15 minutes. Add tomatillos; stir often just
until soft, about 6 minutes. Add broth; bring to a boil over high
heat. Stir in cactus, lime juice, and cilantro. Cook until hot. Ladle
soup into a tureen. Offer cheese to add to taste. Accompany with lime
wedges.
