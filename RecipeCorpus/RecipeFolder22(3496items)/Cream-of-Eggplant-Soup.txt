Title: Cream of Eggplant Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
1 pn Thyme
1 pn Basil
4 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Potato, diced
1/2 c  Cream
1 lb Eggplant
Salt
2 oz Butter
1 md Onion, finely diced
2    Stalks celery, diced
1 ts Curry powder
Salt Pepper Diced tomato, for garnish Chopped chives, for garnish

Dice the eggplant but do not peel.  Sprinkle a little salt over the
eggplant and leave to stand for about 30 minutes.  Put in a strainer
and run a little water over the dice, pat dry.  This removes any
bitter taste which would spoil the soup.

Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the onion, celery and eggplant.
Saute', stirring occasionally until the vegetables have slightly
softened. Eggplant absorbs butter very rapidly so you may have to add
a little more or the vegetables will stick.

Add the curry powder and fry to release the flavors.  Add thyme,
basil, chicken stock and the potato.  Cover and simmer until the
vegetables are quite soft, about 30 minutes.

Put the soup through a sieve or moulin and add the cream.  Taste for
seasoning.  Add a little diced tomato or chopped chives for garnish
and color.

This soup keeps well for several days.  However, if you intend making
it beforehand and keeping it, only add the cream when you reheat it.
It thickens as it stands, but it can be thinned with a little milk.
