Prepare the crepes.

Filling: Place the shiitake mushrooms in a bowl. Cover them with
water and let them soak for at least 1 hour.
Discard the stems and finely chop the mushrooms. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a skillet. Add the onion, garlic and bay leaves.
Saute over low heat until the onions are translucent. Add the
shiitake mushrooms, the fresh mushrooms, and the tarragon. Cook until
the mushrooms are done.

Stir in the flour and mix well. Pour in the wine while continuing to
stir. Cook until the mixture thickens.
Add the tamari and cayenne to taste. Set the filling aside while you
make the sauce.

Sauce: Dissolve the arrowroot or kudzu in the water.
Add the wine. Cook in small saucepan over high heat, stirring
constantly, until the sauce thickens. This is not supposed to be very
thick, so do not overcook it.
Add the tamari to taste and mix well.

To assemble:  If the filling mixture has cooled down, heat it by
returning the skillet to the stove and stirring the mixture over
medium-high heat until it is hot.

Place about 1/4 cup of filling in the center of each crepe and roll
up the crepes.

Place the crepes on individual serving plates. Pour some of the
sauce over each crepe and serve.

Note: If you made the crepes earlier and want to heat them up, place
the unfilled crepes in a cake pan, cover them with aluminum foil, and
bake them at 350 degrees until heated through.
