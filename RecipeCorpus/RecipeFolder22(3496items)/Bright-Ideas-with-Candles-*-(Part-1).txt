1). Candle wax cleanup: Where there are glowing candles, there can
be some dripped wax. Colored wax, especially red, can cause stains.
To remove hardened wax from washable fabrics, carefully scrape the
excess with a knife. Place the stained fabric between several layers
of white paper towels. Press with a warm (not hot) iron, replacing
paper towels as wax is absorbed. If the spot remains, place the
stained side down on whole paper towels; sponge the unstained side
with cleaning fluid. Launder the cloth as usual. If any stain
remains, do not put in dryer. Repeat the cleaning fluid process;
apply liquid or spray laundry stain remover and wash with appropriate
bleach.
2). Place candles in the freezer for a while before lighting. They
will burn more slowly and drip a lot less.
3). Brighten an adult's dessert plate with soft candle glow by using
the small candle holders designed to clip onto christmas tree
branches. Insert a candle and clip to each dessert plate and light
the candles just before serving for a sparkling, festive touch.
4). Red apples can be made into candle holders by cutting holes in
them with an apple corer or paring knife. Insert candles and tie
colorful ribbons around them.
