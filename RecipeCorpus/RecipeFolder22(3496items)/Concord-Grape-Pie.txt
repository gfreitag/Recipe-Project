Title: Concord Grape Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Sugar
1    Lemon; zest and juice
3 tb Flour
1    Egg yolk (optional)
1    Recipe pie crust
-(your choice),
- enough for
2    -9" crusts)
3 lb Concord grapes; washed
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Make the crust, line a pan and roll out the 2nd
crust. Refrigerate both while you make the filling. If you have the
larger amount of grapes, use a deeper pie tin. Slip the grapes from
their skins, working directly into a sauce pan. Put the skins into a
bowl. Cook the grapes until they turn whitish and the seeds are
loosened, about 3 minutes. Pass them through a food mill to get rid
of the seeds, working directly into the bowl with the skins. Stir in
the lower amount of sugar, the lemon zest and the flour. Taste and if
more sugar is needed, add the rest. Add the lemon juice, to taste.
Let cook for 15 minutes. Pour the filling into the shell and cover
with the 2nd crust. Crimp the edges together well so that the juice
doesn't leak out. For a more golden crust, brush the top with a
little beaten egg yolk. With the tip of a knife, etch a decorative
design over the top. Or cut some grape leaves out of the scraps of
dough and fasten them to the crust with a little egg yolk or water.
Bake for 10 minutes in the lower 3rd of the oven then reduce heat to
350F. Bake another 35 minutes or until the crust is nicely browned.
Cool before serving.
