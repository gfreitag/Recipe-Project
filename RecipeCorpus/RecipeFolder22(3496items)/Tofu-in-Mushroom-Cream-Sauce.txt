A couple of days before you will cook this, put a block of tofu in the
freezer in a freezer container.

About 24 hours before you cook, take the tofu out of the freezer.
Pour the vegetable broth over it, and put it in the refridgerator to
marinate. Once the tofu has thawed, cut it into slices and return to
the marinade for at least a few more hours.

When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan. Take the
slices of tofu out of the marinade and dredge in wheat flour. Then
fry until golden brown, turn and fry the other side. Place on a dish
and set aside.

In the same saucepan, add more oil and the water. Add the mushrooms,
green onions, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper and saute until the
mushrooms are soft.

Mix the wine, soymilk, and cornstarch together until there are no
lumps. Add to the saucepan and stir until mixture thickens. Then
carefully place the tofu slices back in the saucepan. Cover, reduce
the heat, and simmer about a minute.

Serve the tofu slices with the mushroom mixture on top. Serve with a
steamed green vegetable, such as asparagus, and a french-style bread.
