Title: Bean and Rice Burritos
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 10 servings
Cumin; dash
Garlic powder; dash
3/4 c  Water
Salsa, oil-free, low sodium
10    Tortillas, whole wheat
1 cn Pinto beans, 16 oz waterpak
1 c  Brown rice; cooked
1/2 c  Onions; frozen, chopped
1/2 c  Gr. peppers; frozen, chopped
1/2 c  Corn; frozen
Chili powder; dash
MMMMM---------------------OPTIONAL TOPPINGS--------------------------
1    Tomato; chopped
Lettuce, chopped
1 bn Scallions; chopped
Saute the frozen onions and green peppers in a few tablespoons of
water in a skillet.  Drain and rinse the beans and place in a skillet
and mash with a potato masher. Add the cooked rice, corn, spices and
water. Heat 5 to 10 minutes until most of water is absorbed, stirring
occasionally.

Heat the tortillas quickly (just to soften) in a preheated skillet, a
toaster oven, or a microwave. Place a line of bean mixture down the
middle of each tortilla, add a teaspoon of salsa and any of the other
toppings as desired.  Fold up 1/2 inch on each side, tuck in the top
edge and roll into a burrito.  Serve immediately, topped with
additional salsa if desired.

The leftover bean mixture can be kept in the refrigerator and
reheated in the microwave prior to assembly.

The bean mixture can be adapted by changing the kind of beans (try
kidney beans) or omitting the corn, or adding your favorite
ingredient. I got more servings out of the recipe than the book got
out of the original recipe, so I guess I put less mixture on each
tortilla.
