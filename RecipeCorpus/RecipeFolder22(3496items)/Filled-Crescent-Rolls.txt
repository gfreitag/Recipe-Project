Title: Filled Crescent Rolls
Categories: Breakfast, Bread
Yield: 8 servings
Egg replacer for 1 egg
1/4 c  Applesauce
1/2 c  Quick rolled oats
2 c  Unbleached white flour
--or whole/wheat pastry
"Fruit only" jam or preserve
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Water, warm
1/4 c  Soy or rice milk, scalded,
--then cooled to luke warm
1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
1/2 ts Salt
Dissolve yeast in warm water, in large bowl. Stir in milk, sugar,
salt, egg replacer (mixed with water, as directed), applesauce, oats,
and 1 cup of flour.  Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining
flour to make dough easy to handle.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and
elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in bowl that has been sprayed with
nonstick coating. Spray top of dough with a little more nonstick
topping. Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2
hours. (Dough is ready if an indentation remains when touched)

Punch down dough. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface into a
12-inch circle. Spread with your favorite "fruit only" jam or
preserves. Cut into 8 wedges. Roll up each wedge, beginning at
rounded end.

Place rolls with points underneath on a baking sheet sprayed with
nonstick spray; curve to form crescents. Let rise until double, about
45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350. Bake  for 20 - 25 minutes, until rolls are golden
brown.
