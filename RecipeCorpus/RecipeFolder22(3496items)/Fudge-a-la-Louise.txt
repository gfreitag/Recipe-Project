Title: Fudge a la Louise
Categories: Candy, Chocolate, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Butter, plus extra for
-greasing platters
1 c  Chopped nuts
1 1/3 ts Vanilla
4 c  Sugar
3    Squares dark baking
-chocolate
1 1/3 c  Milk
In a heavy saucepan mix together the sugar, chocolate, and milk.
Place the pan over high heat and stir constantly until the choclate
is melted and the sugar is dissolved. Bring to a full boil, and lower
the heat so the candy continues to boil gently, not vigorously. Stir
no more. Put a candy thermometer into the center of the mixture and
cook until the temperature reaches exactly 232 F. Meanwhile, butter a
large platter (turkey size) and a flat pan about 11 by 13 inches.
When the fudge reaches 232 F., pour it into the readied platter - do
not scrape the pan, but let it drip out. Dot with 2 tablespoons
butter and let the mixture cool until the platter feels cool
underneath. Add vanilla. Take a large slotted spoon and start to stir
the liquidy mixture - it will take about 15 or 20 minutes. You will
see a steady change from dark to light color, from glossy to dull,
from liquid to solid. When the fudge begins to get dull, add the nuts
and mix in thoroughly. Put fudge into the large buttered pan and
press into shape with the flat of your palms. Cut into squares; store
in airtight container if there's any left.
