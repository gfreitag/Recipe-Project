Title: Whole Wheat Tortillas
Categories: Vegetarian, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
1/2 c  Hot water
Additional flour/kneading
1/2 c  Whole wheat bread flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 ts Salt
In a medium-sized bowl, stir together flours and salt. Drizzle in oil
and distribute it evenly with a fork. Add water and stir mixture to
form a dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and cover
with a cloth towel. Wash and lightly grease bowl.

Thoroughly knead dough, lightly sprinkling flour on kneading surface
only as necessary to keep dough from sticking. When dough is smooth
and resilient, form into a ball, return to bowl, and cover with a
damp towel and plate. Set aside for at least 30 minutes, but
preferably several hours or overnight; it will keep several days
refrigerated.

Divide dough into 6 equal balls. While working with one ball, keep the
others covered. With a rolling pin, roll each ball into a circle 9 to
10 inches across. Stack between waxed paper and cover.

Heat an ungreased but well-seasoned griddle until water sizzles.
Place a tortilla on the griddle and cook 20 seconds, until bottom is
slightly browned and bubbles appear on the surface. Turn and cook 15
to 20 seconds more--the tortilla should still be soft and pliable.
Immediately wrap in a cloth towel and cover with an inverted bowl.
Cook and wrap remaining tortillas in the same manner. Serve warm.
Makes 6 large tortillas.

Variation: For sesame tortillas, omit oil and add 2 tablespoons
roasted, grounds sesame seeds to dough.
