Pour tomato juice into a large bowl.  Set aside.
Place onion, garlic and water in a small saucepan.
Cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes, until onion softens slightly. Add
onion-garlic mixture and remaining ingredients except melba rounds to
tomato juice.  Stir well. Cover and refrigerate several hours to allow
flavors to blend.  Stir well and pour into soup bowls.
Serve with melba rounds.  Serves 8.

Author's Note:  This chilled soup is resplendent with crunchy
vegetables. Don't let the long list of ingredients fool you: It's
really a simple dish to prepare. It keeps for several days in the
refrigerator.
