Prepare cake mixes and bake accordingly to directions.Prepare pudding
mix and chill until ready to assemble. Crumble white sandwich cookies
in small batches in blender, they tend to stick, so scrape often. Set
aside all but about 1/4 cup. To the 1/4 cup cookie crumbs, add a few
drops green food coloring and mix using a fork. When cakes are cooled
to room temperature, crumble into a large bowl. Toss with half the
remaining cookie crumbs and the chilled pudding. gently combine. Line
new, clean kitty litter box. Put mixture into litter box. Put three
unwrapped Toostie rolls in a microwave safe dish and heat until soft
and pliable. Shape ends so they are no longer blunt, curving
slightly. repeat with 3 more Tootsie rolls and bury in mixture.
Sprinkle the other half of cookie crumbs over top. Scatter the green
cookie crumbs lightly over the top, this is supposed to look like the
chlorophyll in kitty litter. Heat remaining Tootsie Rolls, 3 at a
time in the microwave until almost melted. Scrape them on top of the
cake and sprinkle with cookie crumbs. Serve with a new pooper scooper.
