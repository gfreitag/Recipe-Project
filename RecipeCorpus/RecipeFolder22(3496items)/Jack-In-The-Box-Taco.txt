Categories: Tex/mexican, Main dish, Meat
Yield: 12 servings
12    Soft corn tortillas
3 c  Cooking oil(Crisco prefer'd)
6 sl American cheese
1    Head lettuce, chopped fine
1 lb Ground beef
1/3 c  Refried beans
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Chili powder
1/4 c  Ortega taco sauce
1) Slowly brown ground beef over low heat, using wooden spoon to chop
and stir meat, keeping it very fine and smooth. 2) When beef is
browned, drain fat. 3) Add refried beans and use wooden spoon to
smash the whole beans into the mixture, creating a smooth texture. 4)
Add the salt, chili powder, and 2 tbs. of the taco sauce to the
mixture. Remove from heat. 5) In another skillet, heat 1/4" of oil
until hot. (Test with small pc. of tortilla--it should bubble when
dropped into the oil.) Crisco oil will give the food a taste closest
to the original. 6) Spread 1/12 th of beef mixture on center of each
tortilla. 7) Fold tortillas over and press so that the beef filling
acts as an adhesive and holds sides together. 8) Drop each taco into
the pan of hot oil and fry on both sides until crispy. 9) When
cooked, remove the tacos from the oil and place them on a rack or
some paper towels until they are a little cooler. 10) Pry open each
taco slightly. Add 1/2 slice of american cheese (cut diagonally) and
some lettuce. Top with abt. 1 1/2 tsp. of remaining taco sauce.
