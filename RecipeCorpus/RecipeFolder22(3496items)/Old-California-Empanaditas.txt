Title: Old-California Empanaditas
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1    Egg yolk
2 ts Cream or milk
1 c  Butter
1 pk (8 oz) Cream Cheese
1/2 ts Salt
Beat butter, cheese and salt together in a mixer until completely
smooth and blended.  Work in flour to a smooth dough.  (You can use a
mixer for this step, too, but results are superior if you work in the
flour with your fingertips, a fork or rubber spatula).  Flatten dough
in foil to form a an 8 X 6 inch rectangle.  Chill overnight.  (You
can chill it several days before using).  Remove from refrigerator 8
to 10 minutes before rolling. (Many recipes suggest a 30 minute wait
before rolling dough, but it's easier to handle when rolled as cold
as possible). Divide dough for ease in rolling and to insure cold
dough.

Keep unrolled portion in refrigerator until ready to use.  Roll on
floured pastry cloth with floured rolling pin or between two sheets
of waxed paper. The former is easier, in my opinion, and I find
absolutely no sticking when I use a pastry cloth and covered pin.  I
first rub cloth and pin well with flour, then shake out excess.  When
using waxed paper, loosen it on both sides of pastry several times as
you roll.

Shape as directed in specific recipes and chill before baking.  Brush
tops (only) of all pastries with egg yolk beaten with cream.  Bake in
moderate oven (350 degrees) unless otherwise specified.
