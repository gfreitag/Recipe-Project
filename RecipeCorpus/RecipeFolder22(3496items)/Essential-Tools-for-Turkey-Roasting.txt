Make sure you have the following:
* A LARGE ROASTING PAN.
* VEGETABLE OIL AND BUTTER, SALT AND PEPPER.
* A TOWEL. You will have greater luck with the drumstick clamp if
you grasp it and the slippery turkey with a towel.
* AN INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER. This is your most important tool.
With this, you don't need a roasting chart or a clock. Read the facts
on the dial. If you don't have one, get one.
* Also Make Sure You've Got o A TURKEY LIFTER. Some recipes out
there ask the cook to  flip a hot turkey from breast to back during
cooking, supposedly to distribute juices. Try this once and you'll
let nature's browning take its course. But you will have to lift the
turkey out. I recommend a turkey lifter. The best turkey lifter looks
like snow chains but acts as a sling. Two strands of metal chain-link
lie on the bottom of your roasting pan with handles draped over the
side of the pan. The turkey rests on top of the sling. You simply
grasp both handles and heave. This device will put an end to burned
hands, greasy potholders and lost drumsticks.
* FOIL. For great-looking turkeys, lay a sheet of loose foil over
the bird halfway through cooking time. Make it loose, or you'll steam
the bird you're attempting to roast. Also, you may need to wrap foil
booties around the drumsticks so they don't get dry and crunchy.
* BULB BASTER, OPTIONAL. Makes basting easy, but begs the question
about basting at all. New thinking discourages basting. Basting
causes streaking through the skin's sheen. Turkey skin is so thick
that basting really can't penetrate it. Basting only keeps the cook
busy.
* A STRAINER. For straining clear juices for gravy.
