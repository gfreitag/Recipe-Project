1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3/4 c  Cold coffee

Few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce
something that's not possible with a mix.  This sourdough chocolate
cake falls in that category.  It's got a fudge-like quality you can't
get any way except with sourdough and since it's all mixed in one
bowl, it's almost as easy as a boxed cake.

Put the starter in a large bowl, cover loosely and allow to stand at
room temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour. Then
add the rest of the ingredients, in the order given, beating well
after each addition.  It is not necessary to sift or premix any of
the ingredients as long as you are careful to get the baking powder
and soda evenly mixed.

Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, pour in the batter,
which will be thin, and bake in a preheated 350Ã¸. oven for about 30
minutes, or until the layers test done when poked with a toothpick.
The cake will have pulled away from the sides of the pan.

Allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans, then finish
cooling the layers on wire racks.  Do not frost until the cake is
completely cold.

A mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake.
