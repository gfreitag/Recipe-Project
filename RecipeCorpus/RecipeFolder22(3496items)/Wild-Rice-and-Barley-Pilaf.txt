Title: Wild Rice and Barley Pilaf
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 5 servings
3 1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Pearl barley
Salt and pepper
1 sm Onion; minced
1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
1    Garlic clove; minced
1 c  Wild rice
In a 12-inch frying pan or 2- to 3-quart pan, combine onion,
mushrooms, garlic, and 1/2 cup water.  Cook, uncovered, on high heat
until liquid evaporates and a brown film forms in pan, about 15
minutes; stir often. Add 2 or 3 tablespoons water and stir to free
the brown film; cook until the film forms again.  Repeat this step 4
or 5 times until onions are richly browned, about 15 minutes.

Rinse and drain rice.  Mix with broth in pan.  Bring to a boil on high
heat; cover, and simmer 30 minutes.  Rinse and drain barley.  Add to
rice; simmer until grains are tender to bite but just slightly chewy,
about 20 minutes longer.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Makes 5 or 6 servings.
