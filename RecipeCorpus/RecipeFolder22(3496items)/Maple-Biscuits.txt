Sift flour with baking powder and salt.  Cut in shortening until

is formed. Knead lightly on floured board for about 20 seconds.  Roll
to about 1/4 inch thickness and spread well with soft butter. Now

has been scraped from the pail. Fold the other half of buttered dough
over the sugared half. Cut in 1 inch squares and place thightly
together in buttered baking pan. Bake quickly in 450 F. for 15
minutes.
