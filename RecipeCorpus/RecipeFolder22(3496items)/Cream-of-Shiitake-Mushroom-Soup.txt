This rich, earthy soup has but 100 calories per serving if made with
non-fat milk.

PLACE THE MILK, ONION, peppercorns, salt and bouquet garni in a
saucepan and bring slowly to a boil. Form a smooth paste of the rice
flour and the cold milk. Put into the just-boiling milk and stir
briskly until there are no lumps. Simmer over very low heat for 20
minutes. Meanwhile, cut off the tough ends of the mushroom stems.
Reserve a few mushroom slices for garnish and chop the remaining
mushrooms coarsely, then place in a food processor with a steel blade
and chop as finely as possible. Strain the milk mixture through a
fine sieve back into the saucepan; add the chopped mushrooms and
continue simmering 5 minutes. Add the cream and Madeira, if you wish,
and serve in hot bowls, garnished with a slice of mushroom.
