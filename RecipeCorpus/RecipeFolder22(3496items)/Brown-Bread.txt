Categories: Bread
Yield: 16 servings
1 t  Salt
1 c  Black raisins or currants
2 c  Buttermilk
3/4 c  Dark unsulfured molasses
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 c  Rye flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
2 t  Baking soda
Mix cornmeal and flours in a large bowl with the baking soda,  salt,
and raisins.  Beat together liquids in a separate bowl.   Vigorously
blend liquids into dry ingredients with a wooden spoon,  then  pour
into two well-greased or buttered one-pound coffee cans.  Butter two
6" squares of foil and tie around the tops of the coffee cans  with
string. Place on a rack in a closely covered pot, pour 2" of water
into the pot, and weight down the cover for a tight seal and steam
for three hours. Do not open the pot until at least two hours have
passed. Let cool 20 minutes before unmolding.
