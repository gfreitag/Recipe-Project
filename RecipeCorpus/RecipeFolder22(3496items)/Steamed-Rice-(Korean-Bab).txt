Title: Steamed Rice (Korean Bab)
Categories: Asian, Vegetarian, Rice
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Water
2 c  Rice
1.  Pour the rice into a cooking pot. Fill the pot nearly to the brim
with cold water, then pour the water out. The rice will remain at the
bottom of the pot. Repeat this process 4 or 5 times, or until the
water seems quite clear. Rinsing the rice in this manner eliminates
any excess starch.

2.  Cover the rice with 2 cups water and let it stand for 30 minutes.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and steam for 20 minutes or until
dry.

Generally speaking, if Americans are to be served, use 1/2 cup
uncooked rice for each person. Double the amount if cooking for
Koreans, especially Korean men.
