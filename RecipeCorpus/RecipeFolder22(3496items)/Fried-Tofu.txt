Yield: 4 servings
Oil for deep-frying

7 oz Firm Chinese tofu
Deep-fried tofu is used everywhere in Southeast Asia as a hot
appetizer with a dipping sauce  or as a meat substitute. The first
step of pressing the tofu may not be necessary if your tofu is firm
enough; just drain it thoroughly. Most Japanese-style tofu will have
to be pressed.

1. Drain tofu cakes well. Wrap in a clean kitchen towel or several
thicknesses of paper towel, place in a plate set on a sheet pan, and
invert another plate on top. Place a 1-pound weight (canned food, a
cookbook, etc.) on the top plate. Let stand 30 minutes, unwrap, and
drain. The tofu will have exuded a lot of liquid. The recipe may be
prepared ahead of time to this point and refrigerated.

2. Slice pressed tofu into squares, triangles, or other shapes about
1/8 inch thick. Heat oil to 350 degrees F in a wok or other deep pan.
Fry tofu pieces a few at a time until puffy and golden brown, 6 to 8
minutes.

Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer.
