Title: Tomato and Basil Pesto
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
2 ts Fresh lemon juice
-salt (to taste --
-optional!)
-freshly ground black
-pepper (to taste)
3 md Vine-ripened tomatoes
2 c  Tightly-packed basil
1/2 c  Tightly-packed Italian
-parsley
2    Cloves minced garlic
2 ts Balsamic vinegar
* Core the tomatoes and cut in half.  Grill over very hot coals for
only a few minutes to take some of the colour and flavour. (Use oven
broiler if you don't have access to hot coals.) Remove from the grill
and set aside to cool.

* Place basil, parsley, and garlic in a food processor. Process until
smooth. Add the tomato, vinegar, and lemon juice and process. Season
with the salt and pepper to taste.  (I always leave out the salt and
go heavy on the black pepper)

Tastes wonderful on homemade gnocchi or al dente whole wheat pasta.
Freeze excess in ice-cube trays, transferring to a ziplock bag once
frozen.
