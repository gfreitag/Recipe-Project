1 c  Sour cream
3    X-lg eggs
5 tb Butter; melted
12 oz Can Green Gian Mexicorn;optl
1/2 c  Bacon; coarsely chopped
Cupcake papers
1 1/3 c  Flour
2/3 c  Cornmeal
1/2 c  Sugar
3 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda

I like to add the Mexicorn and bacon to this recipe. It certainly does
enhance the flavor, but if you want plain corn muffins, you can
certainly omit these 2 ingredients. Preheat oven to 400~. You'll need
either one or two 12 unit muffin tins, lined with cupcake papers.
Whisk the dry ingredients together, throughly, in a bowl and set
aside. Whisk the sour cream, eggs amd melted butter together until
well-blended. Make a well in the dry ingredients, pour in
cream/butter/egg mixture and if you're adding the corn and bacon, add
them now. Using a spatula, fold the ingredients together, just until
combined--DON'T OVERMIX. Spoon the mixture into the lined muffin
tins, filling them evenly, about 3/4 full. Bake for 20-25 minutes,
testing until a wooden pick comes out clean. Let me know if these
muffins are what you're looking for.  I have more recipes if they're
not. Enjoy.......Susan MM Format Norma Wrenn npxr56b
