Lentils are soft. Meanwhile, heat the Ghee or Oil in a frying pan and
fry the Onion and Garlic. When the Onion softens add the Coriander,
Cumin, Turmeric, and Chili, mixing well. Cook for two minutes, then
add the Cardamoms, Cloves, and Cinammon. Now add the Lentils together
with any liquid they have been cooking in and stir rapidly to ensure
the spices mix in well. Add a little more water if necessary. (This
dish should be fairly liquid.) Add the Salt and continue to cook for
a further 5 minutes. Blend the Coconut with 2/3 Cup Water in a
liquidiser and add to the pan. Chop the Tomatoes into quarters and
add to the Dal just before serving.
