Title: Bean Burritos with Tvp
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
Garnish:
Diced tomatoes, black olives
Guacamole, diced onions,
Picante Sauce
8 lg Flour Tortillas, 10"
2 c  Black or pinto beans
1 c  Vegetarian Chili Mix (TVP)
7/8 c  Water, or white grape juice
1    Medium onion, diced
Method: Heat water or juice to boiling and pour over TVP in a
heatproof bowl. Allow to sit for 10 minutes until water is absorbed.
Add beans with juice to TVP. Saute onions in a little water or juice
until soft. Lay out your tortillas flat, and divide bean-TVP mixture
evenly among the 8 tortillas. Then fold the tortilla up from the
bottom, down from the top, and then fold the two ends to the middle.
"Pin" them with a toothpick. Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray,
place the "envelopes" on the cookie sheet, and spray them with the
cooking spray. Place in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes until
crisp and slightly browned. Take the toothpicks out when baked - they
will stay in shape. Use what you need, and freeze the rest in plastic
freezer bags. When ready to serve, heat in oven or microwave and top
with tomatoes and onions - guacamole and black olives, picante sauce
as desired.
