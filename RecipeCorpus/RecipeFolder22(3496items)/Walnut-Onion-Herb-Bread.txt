*This recipe is for making bread in a casserole dish with no
kneading. To make it in a bread machine cut liquid and flour in half.
In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar over the
warm water. Stir to dissolve and let stand until foamy, about 10
minutes. In a large bowl, combine the mild, remaining sugar, egg,
salt, oil or butter, dill and 1 1/2 cups flour. Beat with a wisk or
heavy duty mixer until smooth. Add the yeast mixture and remaining
flour 1/2 cup at a time, beating vigorously about 2 minutes. Batter
will be sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm area
until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Sprinkle the onion and walnuts
over the top of the batter and stir down, beating vigorously to
evenly distribute. Turn into a well greased 3-quart casserole or
souffle dish, 9-inch springform pan, or 9-inch kugel of tube mold.
Cover loosley with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm area until
doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Bake in the center of the oven until the top is crusty brown, hollow
when tapped and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out
clean, about 45-50 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the sides of the
pan and turn out of the pan onto a rack to cool right side up.
Variation: add 4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into cubes. *For Bread
machine, dump in all ingredinets and push start.
