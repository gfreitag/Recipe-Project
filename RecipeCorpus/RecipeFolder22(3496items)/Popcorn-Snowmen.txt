Title: Popcorn Snowmen
Categories: Snack, Holiday, Popcorn
Yield: 6 servings
Gumdrops, cinnamon candies;
-fruit leather, jelly beans,
-licorice, pretzels,
-for garnish.
4 tb Unsalted butter
4 c  Mini marshmallows
9 c  Popped popcorn
1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
1 tb Milk
In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the
marshmallows and cook, stirring often, until melted and syrupy, about
5 minutes. Place the popped popcorn in a large lightly greased
shallow pan. Pour the syrup over the popcorn, tossing to coat evenly.
While still warm, form 6 balls about 5" in diameter from the coated
popcorn for the bottom sections, giving the balls flat bases so the
snowmen will stand. Form 6 balls about 3-1/2" in diameter for the
middle sections. Then form 6 balls about 2" in diameter for the top
sections. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and milk together until
smooth. Use the icing to stack three popcorn balls of decreasing
sizes into a snowman, then attach candies to decorate. (Gumdrops for
hats, fruit leather for scarves, etc.)
