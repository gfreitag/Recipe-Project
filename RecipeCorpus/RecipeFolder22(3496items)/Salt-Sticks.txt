med. stiff dough.

Form dough into ball and turn in buttered bowl. Turn buttered side up,
cover with plastic, and let rise till doubled in bulk, abt. 1 hr.
Punch dough down, turn onto working surface, and divide into 4 pcs.
Let pcs. rest, covered with towel for 5 min.

Roll each pc. into 10" round. Cut into 8 wedges, then roll each
tightly from the wide end to the point, stretching and elongating the
dough as you roll.  Place on parchment-covered or lightly greased
baking sheet (14 x 17) with point of each roll underneath, leaving
abt. 1 1/2" between salt sticks. Continue till all dough is rolled.
You will fill 2 sheets.

Let sticks rise, covered, to 3/4 proof.  Preheat oven to 400 F.  When
proofed, brush with glaze and sprinkle with seeds and salt.

Bake on upper and lower racks of oven for 5 min., then swap sheets
and turn end for end so browning is even.  Bake 3 min. more, then

golden brown with no white spots on sides.  Cool on racks.  May be
