If you do not have enough STARTER to have 2 Cps for bread recipe,
you can use just one C. STARTER and 2 T. dry yeast.

NOTE:--> The lady who gave this to me, in Anchorage, has the follow
ing notation: I like the taste of the bread made as above, better
than the other. // So much for that. When my starter is ready to use,
I'm going to do the whole thing in my DAK and see what happens..I
might really be roll ing in the dough... All it can do is devour me,
and the West Coast..Ha!

Good Baking to you.. Oven if you're loafing'.. FROM: LYMAN EDDY
