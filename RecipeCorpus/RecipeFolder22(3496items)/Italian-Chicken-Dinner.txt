1    Sm Cabbage; cut in wedges
1 c  Mushrooms; canned
2 tb Tapioca; quick cooking
In a 3 1/2 to 6 quart crockery cooker place cabbage wedges, onion and
mushrooms.  Sprinkle tapioca over vegetables. Place FROZEN chicken
pieces atop vegetables. Pour spaghetti sauce over chicken. Cover;
cook on low-heat setting for 10 to 12 hours.  Transfer to a serving
platter. Sprinkle with Parmesan Cheese. Makes 6 servings.

Notes from Gaye:  The original recipe did not indicate the amount of
onion to use.  I used 1/4 cup dried chopped onion (equivalent to one
onion).  I used 1 cup of Ragu Garden Style with Tomatoes, Garlic and
Onions. Also, I used fresh, skinned chicke n breasts.
