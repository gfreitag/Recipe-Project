1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Lemon juice
1 lb Firm tofu

Mash all ingredients until cottage cheese appearance.

This recipe is great for anyone watching their cholesterol or for
people who don't eat animal products.

Use as you would ricotta cheese; in lasagna, stuffed shells,
manicotti.  Also great on pizza or in layered casseroles.

**Also, if blended until creamy it makes a great sour cream
replacement**
