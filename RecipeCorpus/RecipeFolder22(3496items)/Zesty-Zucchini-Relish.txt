PRESERVING DAY Drain vegetables; rinse with cold running water and
drain into cheesecloth-lined colander, twisting cheesecloth to remove
excess moisture.

in canner over high heat.

Place vegetables in a large stainless steel or enamel saucepan.  Stir
in remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
45 minutes until thick.

Place snap lids in boiling water; boil 5 minutes to soften sealing
compound.

Ladle relish into a hot jar to within 1/2 inch of top rim.  Remove air
bubbles by sliding rubber spatula between glass and food; readjust
head space to 1/2 inch.  Wipe jar rim removing any stickiness.
Center snap lid on jar; apply screw band just until fingertip tight.
Place jar in canner.
Repeat for remaining relish.
