dough and to keep from sticking when kneading. ** Butter or
margarine must be at room temperature or use the same
amount of vegetable oil. In a large bowl mix 2 cups of the
flour, the yeast, sugar, and salt. Stir in the hot water and when
mixed, beat with an electric mixer at medium medium speed or with a
wooden spoon for 2 minutes, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.

Add butter and 1 cup more of the flour; when mixed, beat at medium
speed or by hand for 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally.  With
wooden spoon, gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
a soft dough.

Turn dough out on lightly floured surface (use some of the remaining
flour) and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until dough is smooth and
elastic, adding only enough flour to keep dough from sticking.

Cover dough with bowl and let stand 20 minutes.

In the meantime grease two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pans or a
large baking sheet.

Uncover dough and knead briefly; divide in half and place in pans or
on baking sheet.  Brush 2 sheets of plastic wrap with oil and cover
loaves loosely.

Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours.

When ready to bake, remove from refrigerator, uncover and puncture any
surface bubbles with a skewer or wooden toothpick.  Place in an
unheated oven; turn on oven to 350 degrees F.   Bake 40 to 60 minutes
or until done.

Cool loaves on wire rack.
