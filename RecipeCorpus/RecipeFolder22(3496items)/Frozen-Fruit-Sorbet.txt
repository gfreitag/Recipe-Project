Title: Frozen Fruit Sorbet
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
Strawberries
2 c  Froszen fresh pineapple
1 c  Pineapple juice
1    Frozen banana
1 c  Frozen blueberries or
Preparation time: 10 min.    Cooking time:  none

Put the juice into the blender.  While the blender is running, add
pieces of frozen fruit through the feed tube. Blend untill the
mixture attains a "Soft serve" consistency. Pour into individual
serving dishes. Serve immediately or hold in the freezer for a short
time before serving.

HINT: When I made this I used a food processor. And I put the
leftover into ice cube trays to have again later. You just have to
add a little bit of juice to process it again.
:)  Kids loved it too. :)
