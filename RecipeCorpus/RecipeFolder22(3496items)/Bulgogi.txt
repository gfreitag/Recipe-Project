Title: Bulgogi
Categories: Asian, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Sugar
3 tb Finely minced scallions
1 1/2 tb Finely minced garlic
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 lb Beef top round
1/4 c  Soy sauce
3 tb Rice vinegar
3 tb Sesame oil
2 tb Toasted sesame seeds
1.  Cut the beef on the diagonal into flat 1/8-inch-thick slices,
about 3 to 5 inches long by 1 1/2 inches wide. Place the pieces in a
noncorrosible bowl.

2.  Add the remaining ingredients, one by one, to the bowl. Using
your fingers, mix the preparation gently byt thoroughly.

3.  Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for 12 to 24
hours. Mix the preparation occasionally.

4.  Remove the bowl from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before
cooking the marinated beef.

5.  Drain the beef before cooking, being careful not to press out its
succulent juices or to rub off the clinging sesame seeds. Discard the
marinade, or reserve it for future sauce making.

6.  Barbecue the marinated beef slices in a single layer (the slices
should not touch each other) over hot coals for 25 to 40 seconds per
side, depending on the thickness of the meat and intensity of the
heat.

7.  Serve the 'bul-gogi' immediately.
