Melt together;honey,sugar,cold coffe and butter in small bowl, by
warming it slowly, best in microwave.Let it cool off. Mix the flour
and baking Powder together in bowl, make a well in the middle and put
in the egg and the spices and stir all together slowly adding the
cold honeymixture too. The dough has to be thick but has to drop of a
spoon slowly ,if to thick add a little bit more cold coffe. Grease a
cookiesheet very good and with a wet spatula spread the dough out on
it,about 1 cm thick. Heat oven to 350 gegress F and put the
cookiesheet on the highest rack in the oven. Bake about 20 minutes.
Make the glaze and immedietly glaze the dough when it it comes out of
the oven, cool a little and cut into rectangles. Store in a tightly
closed tin container so they stay soft. Those are the old,
traditional German Lebkuchen and the stores just add fancier shapes
and chocolate icings.The best is to expiriment a little.
