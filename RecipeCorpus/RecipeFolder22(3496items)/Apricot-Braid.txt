1 lb Loaf frozen dough
4 tb Margarine; softened
4 tb Brown sugar
Let bread dough completely thaw. On a lightly floured surface, roll
thawed loaf into a rectangle approximately 14 by 8". Place rectangle
of dough on a greased sheet pan. Spread with 2 tablespoons margarine
and 2 tablespoons brown sugar (save remaining margarine and sugar for
glaze). Drain the apricots, reserving the liquid for the glaze.
Place drained apricot halves lengthwise down center of rectangle.
Sprinkle with marshmallows and cinnamon. With sharp knife or
scissors, cut dough into strips lengthwise down eachside of
rectangle. Make strips 1" wide an 2" deep (or cut in until it almost
hits the filling). Gently stretch each strip and criss-cross over
filling.
Let rise in warm area until puffy, 30 to 60 minutes (see note).
While rising make glaze.
For glaze, combine remaining sugar and margarine with reserved
apricot syrup in a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil. Let boil for 5
minutes. Remove form heat. Set aside. When twist has risen, bake in a
preheated 350 oven for 25 minutes.
Remove from oven and brush with glaze. Return twist to oven and
bake 10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove from oven, brush with additional
glaze. Remove twist from sheet pan to cool on a wire rack. When cool,
slice and serve.
Note: Twist can be assembled in the evening to rise in the
refrigeratior overnight. This enables you to quickly bake it for
breakfast in the morning. Simply brush the unrisen twist with some
melted margarine and cover with plastic wrap to keep from drying out
while in the refrigerator. In the morning, proceed with remaining
recipe instructions.
