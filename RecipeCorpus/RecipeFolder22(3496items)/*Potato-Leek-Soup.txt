Title: *Potato-Leek Soup
Categories: Vegetarian, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 t  Garlic powder
1/8 t  Freshly ground white pepper
1/4 t  Dried dill (optional)
1/2 c  Chopped scallion (optional)
4 c  Peeled & chunked potatoes
4 c  Water [or broth]
2 x  Leeks, white parts only,
- washed well & sliced
1/2 t  Onion powder
Place the potatoes, water and leeks in a medium-sized soup pot. Bring
to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and cook until the potatoes are
tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a blender or food processor and
process until smooth and creamy. Or transfer only half of the soup to
a blender or processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Return to
the pan and stir to mix. This will yield a creamy soup with chunks of
vegetables.

Add the remaining ingredients. Heat through. (If you are using the
optional ingredients, cook over very low heat for 10 minutes.) Serve

Comments: using a hand blender right in the soup pot worked fine.
