DIRECTIONS: Peanut Butter Fudge: Grease 10 by 7 inch baking pan; set

Into 6 quart heavy saucepan, measure sugar, milk and salt. Over medium
heat,heat to boiling, stirring constantly.

With candy thermometer in place, cook, without stirring, until
temperature reaches 235-F or soft ball stage (when a small amount of
mixture dropped into very cold water forms a ball which flattens on
removal from water). Remove saucepan from heat.

Without stirring, allow mixture to cool to 110-F or lukewarm, about 45
minutes (bottom of pan will feel comfortably warm).

Stir in marshmallow creme and peanut butter. With wooden spoon, beat
mixture until it holds its shape and loses some of its gloss, about 5

30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Chocolate Fudge. Pour chocolate layer over peanut
butter layer; allow to set completely.
