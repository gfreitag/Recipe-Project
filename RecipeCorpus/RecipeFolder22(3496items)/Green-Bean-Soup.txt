Title: Green Bean Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Flour
5 c  Bouillon
1 pt Sour cream
1/2 c  Butter
2 md Onions, diced
2 c  Fresh cut green beans
Meat for flavoring: ham hocks, leftover roast, stew or ground beef,
and/or mashed potatoes Salt, pepper, garlic powder, bouquet garni
Additional flour if needed

Melt the butter in a large sauce pan and brown the onions. Add green
beans and simmer for five to ten minutes. Stir in flour and cook five
more minutes. Gradually add bouillon, stirring constantly so that the
flour doesn't lump. Reduce heat and simmer for one hour. Add meat
and/or mashed potatoes if desired. All are extremely good. Season to
taste and continue to simmer slowly. Just before serving, mix a
little of the soup with the sour cream until the cream becomes rather
liquid. If the soup seems too thin, add a little flour to the sour
cream mixture. Add this to the soup. Serve with salad and garlic
bread.
