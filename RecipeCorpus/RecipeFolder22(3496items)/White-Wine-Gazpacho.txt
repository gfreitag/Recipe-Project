the heat.  Thin slices of zucchini and the piquancy of dry white wine
plus Tabasco sauce give this gazpacho a delicious twist.

~-- Coarsely chop the tomatoes; you should have about 1 1/4 cups.
Drain, reserving the liquid (about 1/2 cup).  In a large skillet,
heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the green onions, zucchini and
garlic; saute for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes, pepper, parsley, salt
and Tabasco sauce. Stirring frequently, cook for 5 minutes, or until
the pepper is tender. Turn the vegetables into a large bowl and mix
in the reserved tomato liquid and the broth and wine.  Cover and
refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
