"Chowder originated as fish stew.  But in areas where seafood was
unavailable, resourceful Americans used vegetables.  This recipe comes
from....Rich Spencer, a chef in the Mount Washington Valley."

Peel the parsnips and squash (or sweet potatoes) and cut each into
1/4 inch dice.  Cut the bacon into 1/4-inch strips and render it in a
large saucepan.  When the bacon pieces are lightly browned, transfer
with a slotted spoon to paper towels to dry.  Discard all but 3
tablespoons af the rendered fat.

Add the onion and celery to the pan and cook over medium heat for 3
to 4 minutes, until soft but not browned.  Stir in the flour and cook
for 1 minute to make a roux.  Whisk in the chicken stock and bring to
a boil: the mixture will thicken slightly.

Add the bouquet garni, cinnamon stick, parsnips and squash.  Simmer
the chowder for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender
but not soft.  Stir in the cream, salt, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg.
Just before serving, remove the bouquet garni and cinnamon stick.
Ladle the chowder into bowls and sprinkle each with chopped chives
and nutmeg.

Serves 6 to 8.
