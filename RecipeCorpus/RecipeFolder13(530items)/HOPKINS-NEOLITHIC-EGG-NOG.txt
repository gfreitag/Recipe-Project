Title: HOPKINS NEOLITHIC EGG NOG
Categories: Drinks, Holiday, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
4 C  Heavy cream, beaten
4 C  Milk
4 C  Bourbon
1 C  Dark rum
-e.g., Myers's Rum
12    Egg whites
1/2 C  Sugar
12    Egg yolks
1 C  Sugar
1/4 t  Salt
Beat whites stiff; beat in about 1/2 cup sugar.

Beat yolks until very light with about 1 cup sugar and the salt.  Combine
and stir until thoroughly blended. Add cream, then milk, then Bourbon. Beat
well.  Add rum.  Store in a cold cellar for a week.

Serve with freshly-grated nutmeg.  The egg nog should be ladled from the
bottom of the bowl, and never stirred, in order to maintain its layered
quality.

NOTES:

*  Traditional layered eggnog with bourbon and dark rum -- This is the egg
nog that was served at the Hopkins Neolithic Xmas Party, a party that some
friends used to have every year. We now serve it for our Winter Solstice
celebration. It's purported to come from the original "Fanny Farmer
Cookbook."  Yield: Serves 15-20, inebriates 6.

*  An alternate method, preferred by some, is to make a creamy, non-layered
egg nog by stirring gently every day.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5-10 minutes preparation; 1 week aging.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
