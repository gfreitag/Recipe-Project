Yield: 4 servings
1/2 C  Double cream
-(whipping cream)
Paprika
Salt and pepper
4    Bananas (fairly unripe,
-but not green)
4 sl Ham

Peel bananas, sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika (be generous with
this). Wrap a slice of ham around each banana. Place bananas in a greased,
oven-proof dish and pour cream over them.  Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on
top.  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve
cold (but not refrigerated).

NOTES:

*  Bananas with ham and paprika -- This comes from the "Vogue French
Cookery Book." It seems to go down rather well as an appetizer, although it
would make a nice supper snack, I suppose.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
