1 1/2 t  Green bell pepper,

inch loaf pan. Seal the pan snugly with aluminum foil. Bake until the rice

NOTES:

*  A basic steamed rice for gumbo dishes -- If you are making the gumbo for
appetizer servings, make a 1/3 recipe.  If you make this ahead, leave out
the bell peppers, since they sour quickly.

*  You can use the rice right away, or leave it in the oven to stay warm
for a couple of hours. If you save it longer than that, reheat in the top
of a double boiler or stir it in a skillet with a little butter.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 70 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
