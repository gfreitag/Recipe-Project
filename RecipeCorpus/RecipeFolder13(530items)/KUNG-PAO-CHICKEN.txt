Dust chicken breast with cornstarch and massage in egg white.  Mix sauce
ingredients.

Heat oil in wok and stir-fry peanuts briefly.  Remove from pan.  Stir-fry
chicken about two minutes.  Remove from pan.

Pour in red pepper, garlic and ginger.  Fry until peppers begin to change
color.  Add pea pods, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, chicken and sauce.  Stir
and cook 1 minute. Add peanuts, toss and serve.

NOTES:

*  Stir-fried chicken with vegetables -- This recipe is from a Szechuan
cooking class taught by Susan Newberry, Minnetonka, Minnesota.

*  The original recipe said the mushrooms and pea pods are optional but I
found that they are a must.  The cornstarch and egg white act to seal the
moisture so the chicken does not get dry.  This gives the chicken a very
different texture.  I feel this is the way to stir fry chicken.  But make
sure that you do not let the chicken and egg white stand for more than 5
minutes, otherwise the egg white starts to run. Raw skinless peanuts are
best, but you can also use blanched peanuts. The hoisin sauce and bean
sauce are available at any oriental grocery store and at some supermarkets.
