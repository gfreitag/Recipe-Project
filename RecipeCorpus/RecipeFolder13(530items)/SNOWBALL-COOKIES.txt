Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Usenet
Yield: 4 dozen
1    Egg
1 t  Vanilla extract
1 C  Walnuts, chopped
Confectioner's sugar
2 C  Flour, all-purpose
1/2 t  Salt
3/4 C  Butter (or margarine),
-softened
1/2 C  Sugar
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease cookie sheets lightly with unsalted
shortening.

Sift together flour and salt.  Work butter in a bowl until creamy.  Add
sugar and beat until well blended. Add egg and vanilla and beat well.

Gradually add sifted dry ingredients, beating well after each addition.
Stir in walnuts. Shape dough into small balls about 3/4 inch in diameter.

Place balls about 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets.  Bake 12-15
minutes or until lightly browned.  Roll balls in confectioners sugar while
still warm.  Roll again in sugar when cooled.

Store these in a tight container.  Powered sugar makes this recipe a little
messy.

NOTES:

when sampling lots of cookies.  Just pop one in your mouth and enjoy!
