Title: COGNAC COOKIES
Categories: Usenet
Yield: 3 dozen
-whole pecans)
1/2 C  Sugar (white,
-granulated)
1/4 C  Corn syrup
1/3 C  Cognac (Use the best
-you can afford,
-it makes a difference!)
6 oz Chocolate chips
-(semi-sweet)
2 1/2 C  Vanilla wafers,
-crushed fine (a box
-less some nibbles)
1 C  Pecans (finely chopped;
-start with 8-10 oz
Melt chocolate bits.  If you have never worked with melted chocolate
before, then use a double boiler with the burner set on low.

Crush vanilla wafers very fine (fineness is important).  Chop pecans (again
fineness is everything).  Add sugar, corn syrup and cognac (I use 1 nip of
cognac and  1/2 nip of rum, works fine and costs less).  Stir in pecans and
wafer crumbs.  Now you learn why you were supposed to grind them very
finely.

By now the mixture should be a smooth paste.  Remove from heat and form
into about 1-inch balls. Roll balls in extra granulated sugar.

NOTES:

*  A rich chocolate no-bake cookie -- A terrific, very rich, no-bake
cookie. Adapted from a recipe in the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."
Yield: makes 3-4 dozen.

*  Store these in an air-tight container; if you are a chocoholic, have
someone hide them from you.  They are best if you allow  them to age and
mellow.

: Difficulty:  Moderate to hard (melted chocolate is tricky, and rolling
the mixture into balls takes practice).
: Time:  30-60 minutes or more, depending on how deftly you can roll the
balls.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

: Cheers
