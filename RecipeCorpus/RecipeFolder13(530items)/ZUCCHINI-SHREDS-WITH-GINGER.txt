Heat the oil in a large frying pan over high heat for 3 minutes.  Add the
cumin, let the oil darken slightly (about 10 seconds) and add ginger and
chili.  Cook for 30 seconds, stirring frequently.

2 minutes of cooking.

Turn off the heat.  Sprinkle lemon juice and salt to taste, mix, transfer
to a serving plate and garnish with coriander.

NOTES:

*  Zucchini with ginger and chili peppers -- This is a nice spicy vegetable
dish.  It goes well with fish, especially catfish.  I've always used
zucchini, though it works as well with carrots or cucumbers. You can serve
it as an appetizer or as a side dish, hot or cold. The recipe is originally
from _Travel & Leisure_ magazine. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  I've found that this recipe works best if you use small zucchini, so
that each slice has some peel (skin?) attached. Center slices without
peel/skin fall apart.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
