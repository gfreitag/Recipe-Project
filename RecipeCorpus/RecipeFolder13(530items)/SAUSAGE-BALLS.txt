Title: SAUSAGE BALLS
Categories: Appetizers, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1 lb Cheddar cheese (sharp),
-grated
1 lb Bulk sausage, hot
3 C  Biscuit mix
-(e.g. Bisquick)
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Grate the cheese.  Combine all the
ingredients and knead until well mixed.  You may need to add a little beef
broth to get it to stick together.

Shape into  1-inch balls and place on a cookie sheet or broiler pan.  Bake
at 375 degrees F. for 25 minutes.

NOTES:

*  A spicy snack to be eaten with cocktail sauce -- I got this from my
sister who got it from my mother. My mother has been cooking it for a long
time. Serves 10-12 as appetizer.

*  Don't put too many on a cookie sheet or the grease will fill it up and
run off into your oven. These should be served with cocktail sauce. They
are very rich. They can be made ahead and frozen until your party, then
warmed before serving.

*  Cooks outside North America should remember that a biscuit is a scone.
If you don't have any biscuit mix, you can make some by cutting together
about 2 1/2 cups of flour, about 4 t baking powder, and about 1/2 cup of
vegetable shortening or butter.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
