NOTES:

*  A crunchy sesame seed granola -- I got this recipe from the back of a
page from a green engineering pad with a circuit diagram on the other side.
Where it came from before that I do not know. Yield: About 6 servings.

*  These are much better than any store bought granola.  I eat it as desert
or carry it instead of gorp when backpacking. It is very good eaten
straight, with no milk.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking
: Precision:  no need to measure.
