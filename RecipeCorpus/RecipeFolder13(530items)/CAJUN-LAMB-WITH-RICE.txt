Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix
together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb. Let stand for 15
minutes. Heat oil in a skillet. Sear the lamb until all sides are browned.
Remove lamb to a roasting pan. Roast lamb for 35 to 40 minutes.

While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet used for
searing the lamb.  Saute until soft.  Add tomatoes, chicken stock, basil,
lemon and chili powder.  Bring to a boil and add the rice.  Reduce heat and
simmer until liquid is absorbed.

NOTES:

*  This is a spicy lamb dish that I picked up originally from a local
newspaper.  Yield:  serves 2-3.

*  Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged piece of
meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice mix to cover all
the surfaces.  You will be slicing up the roast before serving anyhow.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  1 hour.
: Precision:  measure the spices.
