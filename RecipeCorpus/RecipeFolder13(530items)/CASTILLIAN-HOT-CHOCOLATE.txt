Title: CASTILLIAN HOT CHOCOLATE
Categories: Drinks, Spanish, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
7 t  Cornstarch (cornflour)
1/2 C  Water
4 C  Milk
1/2 C  Cocoa (powdered),
-unsweetened
1 C  Sugar
Mix the cocoa and sugar together.

Dissolve the cornstarch (cornflour) in the water and combine with the
cocoa-sugar mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.  Stir this until it is a
smooth paste.  Begin heating this mixture, continuously stirring it with a
whisk.  Gradually pour in the milk.  Continue stirring as you bring it to a
simmer.  Simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.  The cocoa is ready
when it thickens and is glossy and smooth.

NOTES:

*  Thick, rich Spanish hot chocolate -- I first tasted this wonderful
beverage while touring in northern Spain with a choir. It's not like any
hot chocolate I've had anywhere else, and I was delighted to find a recipe
in "The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two." It is the best hot chocolate in the
world (at least to me.)

*  The consistency of the finished product should resemble chocolate
pudding that didn't quite set. If you halve this recipe, you'll get just
the right amount for two large mug-fulls. This cocoa is especially
fantastic when you dip churros into it (a churro is a sugary, deep-fried,
doughnut-like stick, and if anyone wants to send out a recipe, I'd be most
grateful).
