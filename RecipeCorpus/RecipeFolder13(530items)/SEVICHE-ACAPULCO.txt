NOTES:

*  A tasty, marinated fish appetizer from Mexico -- This recipe comes from
the Delicias Culinarias cookbook that I brought from Mexico. The
introduction to the recipe reads: "Seviche is prepared with raw marinated
fish.  It is very popular in Ecuador, Peru and in the north of Chile.
Depending on the region in Mexico, there exist several different styles to
prepare it.  This recipe comes from the Acapulco region".

I am sure that you have tasted this appetizer if you have ever been to a
beach in Mexico. It is usually served right where you are "roasting" in the
sun or swimming. Yes, the fish in this recipe is raw. However it is
"cooked" by marinating it in lime juice.

*  Use fresh lime juice.  You can use any kind of fish that you like with
the condition that it does not fall apart after marinating. For instance,
it does not work with white fish.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes (after marinating the fish).
: Precision:  no need to measure.
