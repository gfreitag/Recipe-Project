Categories: Pies, Fruit, Usenet
Yield: 1 pie
2 1/2 t  Cornstarch
10 C  Fruit, sliced
Cinnamon or nutmeg,
-ground (to taste)
1    Pie shell (make your own,
-or buy the frozen,
-uncooked kind)
1/2 C  Water
1 C  Sugar
Mash about 2 C of the fruit in a saucepan with the water, sugar, and
cornstarch.  Add another sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon.  Boil until the
liquid becomes clear (about two minutes).

Place the remaining fruit in the pie shell, and a sprinkle of the nutmeg or
cinnamon.  Pour the hot mixture over the fruit, and let cool for at least
two hours.

Serve with whipped cream or ice cream as desired.

NOTES:

*  A quick fruit tart pie -- This is just about the ideal way to use up any
fresh fruit you have lying around.  I got the recipe from my mom.

*  Any fresh fruit in season will do; I've made peach, nectarine and
strawberry/banana, all to good effect.

*  Scheduling usually works out well if you make this shortly before
serving the meal, and let it cool while you eat.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, two hours cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
