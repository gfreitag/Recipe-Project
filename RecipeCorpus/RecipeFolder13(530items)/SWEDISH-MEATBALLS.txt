Title: SWEDISH MEATBALLS
Categories: Meats, Appetizers, Swedish, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Meat, ground
-(mixture of beef
-and pork)
Salt and pepper
1/2 C  Bread crumbs
1/2 C  Milk
1 sm Onion
1    Egg
Mix bread crumbs and milk.  Let it swell for about 10 minutes.  Mince the
onion and fry it until soft.  Mix all the ingredients.

Form into small balls with your hands.  This is easier to do with wet
hands. The size of the balls can vary a little, but a cherry is too small
and a ping-pong ball is too big.

Fry the balls in butter in a frying pan (medium hot) for about 5 minutes.
Turn them around to get them fried on all sides.  The balls get dark brown.

NOTES:

*  A traditional Swedish recipe -- It is served at the smorgasbord and also
at Christmas in Swedish homes (as one of many dishes). It can also be
served with brown sauce, potatoes and lingonberry jam at lunch or dinner.
Kids love the meatballs with pasta.

*  It's a little bit tricky to get the balls round.  Don't put all the
meatballs in the frying pan at once.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30-40 minutes.
