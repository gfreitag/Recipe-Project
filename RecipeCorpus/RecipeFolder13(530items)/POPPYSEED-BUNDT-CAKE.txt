Title: POPPYSEED BUNDT CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Usenet
Yield: 1 servings
2 oz Poppy seeds
-(about 1/4 cup)
1 t  Almond extract
-(or vanilla extract)
4    Eggs (separated)
1/4 C  Brown sugar
1 t  Cinnamon
1 C  Butter (or margarine)
1 1/2 C  Sugar
2 1/2 C  Flour (sift
-before measuring)
1 t  Baking soda
2 t  Baking powder
1 C  Buttermilk
Soak poppyseed in the buttermilk for 15 minutes.

Cream together butter and sugar.  Add yolks to creamed mixture.  Add almond
extract or vanilla.  Add dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk
mixture, a little at a time.

Beat egg whites very stiff as for angel food.  Fold egg whites into
mixture. Pour half of this batter mixture into well-greased Bundt pan.
Sprinkle with a mixture of about 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 1 t
cinnamon.  Pour in remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour.
Cool and invert onto serving dish, then remove Bundt pan.

NOTES:

*  A light, delicate cake -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure
where she got it.

*  When folding in egg whites, be gentle.  Lift and turn the batter instead
of using a stirring motion. Don't worry if a little bit of egg white
remains unmixed; the egg whites will collapse if you mix it too much.

*  I have tried both vanilla and almond extracts with this recipe, and
prefer the former.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate (folding the beaten egg whites into the
batter takes some skill).
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  Measure carefully.
