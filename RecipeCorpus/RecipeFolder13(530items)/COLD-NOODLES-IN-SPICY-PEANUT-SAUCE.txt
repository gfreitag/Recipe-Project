Title: COLD NOODLES IN SPICY PEANUT SAUCE
Categories: Entrees, Chinese, Pasta, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 T  Hot bean paste
-(up to 2 T)
1 T  Sesame oil
1 lb Lo mein noodles (other
-noodles will do,
-such as ramen noodles,
-or even spaghetti)
2 T  Garlic, minced (fresh)
3 T  Coriander, minced
-(fresh)
1/2 C  Peanut butter
5 oz Soy sauce, light
5 T  Sugar
Rice wine (between
-1/2 t to 1 T)
Cook the lo mein according to directions.  Let cool.  Mix the rest of the
ingredients.  Peanut butter doesn't mix very well, so for a few minutes
you'll think you've made a mistake. Don't worry, just keep stirring until
it's smooth. Add the sauce to the noodles.

Hot bean sauce also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is the
main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care.  Vary this
ingredient to taste. This recipe is probably very good without it. It's
also quite good served when the noodles are still hot.

NOTES:

*  Mildly spicy cold noodles -- I first had this at Brandy Ho's in
Chinatown, San Francisco. I forget where I found the recipe.
