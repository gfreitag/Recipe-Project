Title: PLAIN OLD BREAD
Categories: Breads, Usenet
Yield: 2 loaves
2 1/2 t  Sugar
1 t  Salt
1 3/4 C  Water
2 T  Vegetable oil
6 C  Flour, all-purpose
1/2 oz Yeast (dry),
-quick-rising
-(2 envelopes)
1/4 C  Water, lukewarm
7 T  Milk, dry
In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in about 1/4 cup lukewarm water.

In a large mixing bowl, mix the powdered milk, sugar, salt and about 1 3/4
cups water together.  Stir with a whisk until smooth, then add yeast
mixture.

Sift in about 3 cups of flour and mix until smooth.  Add the oil; mix.

Gradually sift in the remaining flour.  When it becomes stiff enough to
handle remove from the bowl and knead it as you add the flour. Knead it for
5-7 minutes after the last flour is added.

Place the dough in a oiled bowl and turn it over to coat uniformly.  Then
place it in a warm place to rise until it has doubled in size (about 45
minutes).

Remove from bowl and knead a little.  Divide into two equal parts, shape
into loaves, and place in loaf pans. Let rise again until doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Bake 45 minutes.  Remove loaves from pans
and cool on a wire rack.

NOTES:

*  Ordinary white bread -- This recipe is derived from the basic bread in
the American Heart Association Cookbook.

*  This is good everyday bread.  Be careful:  it's easy to eat too much and
get fat.  You may want to have someone who has made bread before help the
first time as the amount of flour may have to be adjusted depending on the
slight differences in your measurement of the liquids and the humidity of
the day. Once you have done it it is easy to do by the feel of the dough.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising, 1 hour cooking and
cooling.
: Precision:  measure carefully.
