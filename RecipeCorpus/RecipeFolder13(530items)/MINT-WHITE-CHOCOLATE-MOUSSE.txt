Title: MINT WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
Categories: Mousse, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2    Egg whites
-(at room temperature)
4 oz Chocolate, white
3 T  Creme de menthe, green
1 C  Cream, heavy
Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.  When melted, stir in the
creme de menthe. Let it cool a bit and stir in about 2 1/2 T of cream. Let
cool.

Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Fold the
chocolate-creme-cream mixture into the beaten egg whites. THE MORE
CAREFULLY YOU FOLD, THE LIGHTER WILL BE THE MOUSSE.

Whip the remaining cream, until soft peaks form.  Fold the egg
whites-chocolate mixture into the whipped cream.  AGAIN, THE MORE AIR YOU
PRESERVE, THE LIGHTER THE MOUSSE.  Spoon carefully into small bowls or cups
and chill for about two hours.

NOTES:

*  Sinful and light mint chocolate mousse -- This concoction is a variation
of another white chocolate mousse, which is a variation of a dark rum
chocolate mousse. It was invented for a friend's birthday, which happens to
be on St. Patrick's Day. We were sitting around the day before, planning
the celebration, and I offered to bring some white mousse. Someone
suggested it should be green, in honor of the occasion. I came up with the
perfect way to make green chocolate mousse....

: Difficulty:  moderate, depending on folding and whisking skills.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
