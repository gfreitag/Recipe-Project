NOTES:

*  A make-it-yourself mix for buttermilk pancakes -- This recipe comes from
the "More Make-a-mix Cookery" cookbook put out by HP Books.  The premise of
this book and its predecessor, Make-a-mix Cookery is that you can save time
and money by making your own mixes for every stage of dinner planning.  It
seems to work.  Yield:  10 cups of mix of mix.

*  Use the mix within 6 months of when you make it.

*  The pancakes made from this mix aren't as sweet as those made from Aunt
Jemima mix, but they are good.  You can always add sugar, of course.

*  Although we haven't tried this (yet), you could probably vary the recipe
by using a different type of flour to make, for example, your own buckwheat
pancakes.

*  If you can't find buttermilk powder in your local grocery store, try a
bulk food store.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes to make the mix if you have the ingredients.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
