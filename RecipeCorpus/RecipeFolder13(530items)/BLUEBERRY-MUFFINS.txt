Title: BLUEBERRY MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Usenet
Yield: 12 muffins
3/4 C  Milk
1/3 C  Cooking oil
3/4 C  Blueberries
1 t  Lemon peel
1 3/4 C  Flour
6 T  Sugar
2 1/2 t  Baking powder
3/4 t  Salt
1    Egg, beaten
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Stir together the flour, sugar, baking
powder and salt. Make a well in the center.

In a separate bowl, combine the egg, milk and oil.  Add egg mixture, all at
once, to the flour mixture.  Stir JUST until moistened.  Yes, the batter
should be lumpy.  (If you try to stir all the lumps out, your muffins will
be very tough.) CAREFULLY fold in blueberries and optional lemon peel.

Grease muffin cups, or line with paper bake cups; fill each 2/3 full. Bake
at 400 degrees F. for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from
pans; serve warm with butter.

NOTES:

*  Award-winning blueberry muffins -- these muffins won a blue ribbon
during the years that I was eligible for the Dade County (Miami, Florida)
Youth Fair. I think this particular recipe came originally from the "Better
Homes and Gardens Cookbook," but I could be wrong.

*  The less you stir once you've combined the two mixtures, the better your
muffins will be.  (To a point, but over-mixing is much more common than
under- mixing.) Frozen blueberries work fine, if you can't get hold of
fresh berries. I'm sure other kinds of fruit will work fine, too, but I
haven't tried them.

: Difficulty:  moderate (proper mixing technique required).
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 25 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
