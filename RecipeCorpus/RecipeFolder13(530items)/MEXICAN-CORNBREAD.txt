NOTES:

*  Corn Bread with peppers and cheese -- I got this recipe from net.cooks
in the fall of 1983. It's really good! We always make a batch of Mexican
cornbread when we cook chili; it's also a good dinner with just a salad and
the beer of your choice.  The original recipe came from akgua!akguc!mah.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 90 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
