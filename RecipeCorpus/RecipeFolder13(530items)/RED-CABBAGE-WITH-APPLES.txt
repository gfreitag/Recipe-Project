Title: RED CABBAGE WITH APPLES
Categories: Entrees, Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
2    Apples, tart, cored
-and diced (not peeled)
2 T  Brown sugar
1 T  Wine vinegar
1/2 t  Caraway seeds
3 lb Red cabbage
6 T  Bacon fat or butter
-(or less)
1    Onion, finely chopped
1 C  Red wine, dry
Discard the outer leaves of a firm,  3-lb red cabbage, and cut it in half.
Shred finely and soak in salted water for 15 minutes.  Drain well.

Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large, heavy skillet and add 1 finely
chopped onion.  Cook onion until transparent, about 5 minutes, then add
cabbage.  Toss well with two wooden spoons, as you would a salad.  When
cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste,
and red wine.

Simmer for 5 minutes and then add 2 tart apples, cored and diced, but not
peeled.  Sprinkle with brown sugar, and add wine vinegar and caraway seeds.
Cover, with lid slightly askew, and simmer over low heat for about 45
minutes. Serves 8 and is good hot or cold.

NOTES:

*  A fruity cabbage saute -- I just tried this recipe from a column in the
local paper.  It's good winter food, very satisfying on a cold nasty day.
My only caveat is to use a *large* skillet, or halve the recipe. I cooked a
full batch and had cabbage overflowing onto the stove.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

: Enjoy!
