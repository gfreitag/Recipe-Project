Categories: Cheesecakes, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
2/3 C  Brown sugar
1/2 C  Butter, unsalted
-(at room temperature)
2 C  Rolled oats (do not
-use instant oatmeal
-or steel-cut oats)
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
3/4 C  Cottage cheese,
-small-curd
1 t  Vanilla extract
11 oz Cream cheese
-(at room temperature)
3    Eggs
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix crust ingredients with your hands until
well blended.  Put the mixture in a 9-inch springform pan and form a crust,
pushing it about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan.  Bake the crust
about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F. and let it cool.

Beat (or mix) the filling ingredients, at very high speed, for seven
minutes. The mixture must be very smooth. Put the filling in the baked
crust.  You may want to re-form the crust slightly first.

Bake for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees F.  The cheesecake is done when the
filling is firm, but not dark (burned) on top.  Let it cool, then chill it.

NOTES:

*  A moist cheesecake with a wonderful crust -- A college friend gave me
this recipe, oh so many moons ago. It comes from his parents, and may have
roots in Belgium. It is very different from the typical New-York-style dry
cheesecake.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure carefully.
