6    Szechuan peppers

2 T  Sesame oil (or
-a mixture of sesame
-oil and clear vegetable
-oil, to taste)
In a wok heat the oil, then toss in the Szechuan peppers.  After about 30
seconds (long enough for the scent to be released) toss in the cubed

eggplant is tender (about 10 minutes.) Remove the peppers before serving.

NOTES:

*  A simple Chinese-style recipe for fresh eggplant -- My favorite for
eggplants out of the garden is to stir-fry them with garlic and hot peppers
in sesame oil, according to this simple recipe.

*  I've heard it said that the Armenians judge the value of a woman by how
many ways she can cook eggplant.
