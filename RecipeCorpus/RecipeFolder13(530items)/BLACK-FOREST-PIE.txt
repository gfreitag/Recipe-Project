Categories: Pies, Usenet
Yield: 1 pie
2    Eggs, beaten
1 1/4 lb Cherry pie filling
-(one large can)
8 oz Whipped cream
1 oz Chocolate (unsweetened),
-coarsely grated
1    Pie crust, cooked
3/4 C  Sugar
1/3 C  Cocoa, unsweetened
2 T  Flour
1/4 C  Butter
1/3 C  Milk
Prepare your favorite crust for a filled 1-crust pie.  Preheat oven to 350
degrees F.  In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, cocoa and flour; add
butter and milk. Cook until mixture begins to boil, stirring constantly.
Remove from heat.

Add small amount of hot mixture to eggs, mix well, then fold egg mixture
into the chocolate mixture. Fold 1/3 of the pie filling into chocolate
mixture; save the rest for the topping. Pour chocolate mixture into pie
crust. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 35-45 minutes or until center is set but
still shiny. Cool and chill one hour.

Whip the cream.  Combine 2 cups whipped cream and grated chocolate and
spread over cooled pie. Top with remaining pie filling and the remaining
whipped cream. Chill at least half an hour before serving.

NOTES:

*  A rich chocolate/cherry pie -- I got this recipe from my mom; I don't
know where she got it.

*  I use a pre-mixed whipped topping rather than real whipped cream when I
make this pie.
