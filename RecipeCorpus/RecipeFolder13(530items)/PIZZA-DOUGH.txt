Title: PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Breads, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
2 t  Salt
2 C  Water
5 C  Flour
2 pk Yeast (dry), active
2 T  Sugar
Mix all of the dry ingredients first, then add the water.  It will appear
to be too dry. Do not add water. Keep working the dough until it is smooth.
(This requires a little faith but it really works).  Let the dough rise
once (approx 1 hour). Punch it down and knead again.

At this point you may choose to freeze some of the dough.  If you do freeze
it, be sure to wrap it well and freeze it quickly.  With either fresh or
thawed dough, let the dough rise a second time.

After it has risen, punch it down and use it for your pizza.  The dough
will rise a little while you put the rest of your pizza toppings on it.
Then bake as appropriate for pizza thickness and toppings.

NOTES:

*  Simple pizza dough -- I don't remember where I learned this simple
recipe for pizza dough. It makes enough dough for two 12 x 18 pan pizzas. I
like it because it is so easy to memorize and it makes good pizzas. Of
course, it is not quite as easy to memorize in its metric rendering. Yield:
2 pizza crusts.

*  I have tried variations like whole wheat, and just about any flour
combination that works for bread works for pizza dough.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
