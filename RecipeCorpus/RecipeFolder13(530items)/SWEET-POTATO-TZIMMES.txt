Categories: Casseroles, Jewish, Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 lb Prunes, pitted and
-halved
1/3 C  Water
1/3 C  Sugar
1 t  Cinnamon, ground
1/2 t  Nutmeg, ground
1/2 t  Ginger, ground
4 lg Sweet potatoes,
-peeled and diced
1    Butternut squash,
-peeled and diced
4    Tart apples, peeled,
-cored and diced
1/3 C  Passover wine, sweet, red
Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix well to distribute the
liquid evenly.  Dump into a baking dish and seal the baking dish tightly
with aluminum foil and a lid. Bake 1 hour at 350 F. Cool.

To serve, reheat, then empty into a serving dish.  Don't serve it out of
the pan you cooked it in (the movement into the serving dish squeezes
juices out of the fruit).
