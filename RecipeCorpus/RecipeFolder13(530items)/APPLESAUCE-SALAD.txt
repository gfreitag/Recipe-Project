3 oz Lemon jello mix

Place the candy and water in a pot.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve

Stir in applesauce and ice cubes until ice cubes are melted.  Pour into a
bowl and refrigerate until set (1 hour or more).

NOTES:

*  Applesauce jello salad -- A delicious jello salad, taken from The
Monterey Coast Guard Officers' Wives Club Cookbook. My sister-in-law was
the president of the club which put that cookbook together.

*  Substituting apple cider or apple juice for the water adds tremendous
taste.  We prefer homemade chunky style applesauce to processed commercial
brands.
