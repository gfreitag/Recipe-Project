NOTES:

*  Moist cookies with cranberries, apples and cinnamon -- Many years ago
one of my brothers complained to me that he didn't like cookies much, that
they were always too dry and pasty. I came up with this recipe for him. He
still doesn't like cookies, but the recipe has made its way to various
other people to become a favorite.

*  Don't store these in a cookie jar, they will get too mushy.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes baking.
