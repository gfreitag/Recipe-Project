Title: CURRIED RICE
Categories: Grains, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 C  Chicken broth (or
-chicken bouillon,
-or water)
2    Parsley sprigs
1    Bay leaf
2 1/2 t  Butter
1 C  Onion, chopped
1/4 t  Garlic, minced
1 C  Rice
1 T  Curry powder,
-vary to taste
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Obtain casserole or heavy ovenproof
saucepan with a close-fitting lid.

Over a burner on moderate heat, melt half the butter in the casserole and
cook the onion and garlic, stirring constantly, until the onion is
translucent.

Add the rice and stir until well-coated with butter.  Add the curry powder
and stir until well-blended. Add the broth and stir to make sure there are
no lumps. Add the parsley and bay leaf on top.

Cover and bake in the oven for 17 minutes (Franey says exactly 17 minutes,
but basically "cook until done.") Discard parsley and bay leaf and stir in
remaining butter.

NOTES:

*  Baked rice with a mild curry flavor -- This is a slight modification of
the "Riz a l'Indienne" from the 60-Minute Gourmet (Pierre Franey). It's
more French than Indian, and goes well with, say, sauteed chicken in cream.

*  This basic recipe may be varied by modifying quantities (for example,
less onion) or adding ingredients (for example, pine nuts or apple chunks).

: Difficulty:  easy
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 25 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  Measure the rice and broth.
