Tabasco sauce,

1    Onion (very large),

1/2 C  Raisins
1/2 C  Rice, raw
2    Yams
Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp.  Add chopped
greens and fry a bit.

Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then slice
them into thick slices.  Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes, salt and
pepper.  Cook a couple of minutes.

Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot.  Put the rice in the
well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is done,
about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste.

NOTES:

*  A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got it from
a friend. It's very easy to make.

*  I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless you put
in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue. You should add
enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
