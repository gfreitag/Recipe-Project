Title: RUBEN VILLAVICENCIO'S VEGETABLE PIE
Categories: Entrees, Usenet
Yield: 3 servings
1    Garlic clove, crushed
-(or more to taste)
1    Broccoli bunch, broken
-into small florets
1/2 t  Basil, dried
Thyme
2 C  Cheddar cheese, grated
1 C  Milk
Paprika
3 C  Potato (raw),
-packed, grated
-(about 3 large potatoes)
1 t  Salt
4    Eggs
1 1/4 C  Onion, grated
-(or more to taste)
2 T  Oil
3 T  Butter
Drain the potatoes and squeeze dry.  Add about 1/2 t salt, 1 egg and about
1/4 cup (or more to taste) grated onion. Pat potato mixture into well-oiled
10-inch pie pan and bake at 400 degrees F. for 30 minutes.  Brush potato
crust with oil, reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. and bake for
another 5-10 minutes, until crust is brown.

While crust is baking, saute about 1 cup chopped onion and garlic in
butter. If you like a lot of onion and garlic, use more. Add broccoli,
about 1/2 t salt, basil, a dash of thyme, and cook covered, stirring
occasionally, for a few minutes.

Spread half of cheese over baked crust.  Top with sauteed vegetables and
remaining cheese.

Beat together remaining 3 eggs and milk,  and pour over vegetable/cheese
mixture.  Sprinkle paprika on top.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 35 to 40
minutes until custard is set.

NOTES:

*  A wonderful vegetable pie -- This recipe is originally from the _Los
Angeles Times_.  It takes a lot of time to make, but it's quite good.
Yield: serves 3-4.

*  This recipe can be made in two stages:  you can make the crust in
advance and then can make the vegetable topping and bake it later.

*  An electric grater is a real time-saver for the crust ingredients.
