Title: STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB PIE
Categories: Pies, Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
---------------------------------PIE CRUST---------------------------------
5 T  Milk, cold
-(can use water)
2 1/4 C  Flour
3/4 C  Shortening
--------------------------------PIE FILLING--------------------------------
6 T  Tapioca (tapioca
-starch preferred,
-but quick-cooking
-tapioca is okay, too)
1 C  Sugar
1 lb Rhubarb, cut into
-1/2-inch pieces
6 C  Strawberries (or less)
Cut the strawberries in half.  Place in a bowl with the rhubarb and add the
sugar and tapioca.  Mix and let sit for at least 15 minutes. Make the pie
crust:  Cut the shortening and flour together.  This can be done with two
knives, with a pastry cutter, or with some electric mixers.  (I do mine in
a Kitchen Aid food processor/mixer.) When the mixture has an even
consistency (it should resemble coarse sand), add in the milk (or water).
Take about 5/8ths of the dough and roll out on a floured board until it is
a little bit larger than a 10-inch pie pan. Put this in the pie pan. (The
rest of the dough is for the top of the pie.)

Pour the strawberries and rhubarb mixture into the pie crust.  Roll out the
remainder of the pie crust.  Place on top of the pie, crimping the edges of
the top and bottom crusts together.  Make one or two slits in the top of
the crust for steam to escape. Bake 45 to 50 minutes at 400 degrees F. or
until Ayrup boils with heavy bubbles that do not burst.

NOTES:

*  A sweet and tart dessert, this recipe came from the _Los Angeles Times_
about 15 years ago.

*  Strawberries and rhubarb are both seasonal fruits.  Their season is late
spring/early summer.

*  You can use about 3/4 cup sugar if you like it less sweet.

*  I recommend putting a piece of aluminum foil under the pie as it is
cooking, because it invariably leaks.  This will save you from having to
clean up the oven.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  Preparation:  20-25 minutes; baking:  45-50 minutes; cooling:  30
minutes.
: Precision:  Measure the crust ingredients!
