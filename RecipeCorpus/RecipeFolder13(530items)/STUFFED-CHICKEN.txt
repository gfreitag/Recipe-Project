Title: STUFFED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Usenet
Yield: 2 servings
-tip of a paring knife)
2    Celery stalks
10 md Mushrooms
3    Scallions
3 T  Butter
1    Chicken, with giblets
1/2 C  Rice, white (raw)
1 pn Saffron (use the
-amount that sticks
-to the first 1/2 inch
Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees F.  Clean the chicken, remove any large gobs
of fat and rinse away any residual goo from its inside.

Cook the rice in 1 cup of water, along with the saffron.  Salt to taste.
Saute the giblets in about 2 T of butter.  While these are cooking, clean
and cut up the celery, mushrooms and scallions into small pieces.

When the giblets are done, chop them well.

Mix the rice, vegetables and mushrooms together in a bowl, and cram as much
as will fit into the chicken. Tie the ends of the drumsticks and the tail
together.  Rub about 1 T of butter over the skin of the chicken.  Place
remaining stuffing into a glass or ceramic casserole, cover, and set aside.

Place in the chicken in the oven, uncovered.  After 10 minutes, lower heat
to 350 degrees F. The chicken should cook approximately 20 minutes per
pound. Test the chicken by pricking it in the thickest part of the thigh;
when it is done, only clear juices will come out. If the chicken is still
underdone, blood will come out.

Half an hour before the chicken is done, put the additional stuffing in the
oven.

If there are leftovers, be sure to remove any extra stuffing from the
inside of the chicken, as it will sour if stored inside the bird.
