Drain apples and add to the mixture.

a pastry cutter or two knives. Remove pies from oven and cover with topping

Don't take your eyes off the pies while they're under the broiler.  A
moment's inattention can mean burned pie!

NOTES:

boss, Dick Dolan, the editor of the _Hewlett Packard Journal_. It is
sinfully delicious and never lasts very long, even if you don't have help
eating it!

*  If there is any pie left over, the remainder should be refrigerated.
