Categories: Cakes, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
1/2 C  Butter, melted
2    Eggs
3/4 C  Coffee (black), cold
1/2 C  Brown sugar
1 C  Raisins
1 C  Fruit, mixed
1 C  Dates
1/4 C  Rum or brandy
1 C  Flour, all-purpose
1/2 t  Salt
1/4 t  Baking soda
1/4 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Allspice
1/2 t  Cinnamon
1/2 t  Cloves
1/2 t  Mace
1/2 t  Nutmeg
-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
1/2 C  Sugar
4 T  Butter
1/2 C  Rum or brandy
Mix the melted butter, eggs, rum and coffee together.  Add brown sugar and
mix well. Add rest of dry ingredients and place in a buttered loaf pan.

Bake at 300 degrees F. for 2 hours or until done (it will separate from the
sides of the pan).  Make glaze when almost completely baked:  Melt (do not
boil) butter.  Add rum and sugar.  Stir by hand.  Remove the cake from the
oven and pour half of the glaze over it.  Let it cool 25 minutes, then turn
it over and pour the remaining glaze on the other side.

NOTES:

*  A traditional European-style fruit cake -- Although fruitcakes have a
bad reputation, this one is *excellent*. My mother has been making it for
years. She originally got the recipe from a friend, but has since adapted
it to suit her fans. (She gets requests for it all year long.)

*  Don't use glass pans.  This freezes well, if you make more than you can
eat; just be sure to wrap it carefully so it doesn't get freezer burn. Warm
frozen cake in the oven, not the microwave.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 30 minutes finishing.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
