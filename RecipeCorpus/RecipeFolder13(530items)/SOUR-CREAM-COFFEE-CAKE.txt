Title: SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
1/2 pt Sour cream
6 T  Butter, softened
1 C  Light brown sugar,
-firmly packed
2 t  Cinnamon
1 C  Nuts, chopped
-(walnuts or pecans)
1/2 C  Shortening
3/4 C  Sugar
1 t  Vanilla
3 lg Eggs
2 C  Flour, sifted
1 t  Baking powder
1 t  Baking soda
Prepare a 10-inch tube pan.  I use one with a removable center.  Grease the
pan and cut a circle of waxed paper to cover the bottom.  Preheat oven to
350 degrees.

Cream shortening, sugar and vanilla, thoroughly.  Add eggs, singly, beating
well after each addition.

Sift flour, baking powder and baking soda together.  Add flour mixture and
sour cream to creamed mixture.  Alternate a little of each, blending after
each addition.

In separate bowl, cream butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together.  Add
nuts and mix well.

Spread 1/2 of the batter in the tube pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 of the nut mixture
evenly over batter in pan.  Cover with remaining batter.  Sprinkle with
remaining nut mixture.  Bake in preheated oven for about 50 minutes.

When the cake cools, run a knife around the side of the pan and remove the
inner section.  Carefully remove the cake from the base of the pan and
remove the waxed paper.

or as an evening dessert. Enjoy it. Yield: Fills 10-inch tube pan.
