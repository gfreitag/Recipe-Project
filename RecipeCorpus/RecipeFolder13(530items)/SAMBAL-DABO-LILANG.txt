NOTES:

*  Indonesian relish with lime, chili and basil -- This recipe comes from
the "Time/Life Pacific and Southeast Asian Cooking." I've been unable to
find a recipe even remotely resembling it in any other Indonesian cookbook.
I like to cross-reference recipes and learn where they came from, but only
the Time/Life reporters seem to have found this one. In any event, it's
quite wonderful. Not for the faint of heart.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 hours sitting.
: Precision:  no need to measure, but count the chili peppers.
