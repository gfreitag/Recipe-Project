NOTES:

*  A southern-hemisphere Christmas plum pudding -- We here in the Southern
Hemisphere have a summer Christmas so we have adapted some of the more
traditional festive fare to local conditions.  Here is one example.  It is
very easy, and it can be made up to a week ahead of using.  Yield:  Serves
8-10.

*  The original recipe called for the use of a microwave to do the heating
and cooking. This works well for melting the gelatine but is a bit of a
nuisance otherwise.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate (timing matters).
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, overnight freezing.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
