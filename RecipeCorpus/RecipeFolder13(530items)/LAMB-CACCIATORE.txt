Title: LAMB CACCIATORE
Categories: Meats, Soups, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Sage leaves, dried
2 t  Flour
1/2 C  Vinegar (white or wine)
1/2 C  Water
Salt and pepper,
-to taste
4 lb Lamb shoulder or leg;
-trim fat and cut
-into bite-size cubes
1/3 C  Olive oil
1 sm Garlic clove, minced
1 t  Rosemary, dried, crushed
In a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish brown the meat in hot olive oil.
Be careful not to burn the olive oil: it has a lower burning temperature
than other kinds of cooking oil.

Add garlic, rosemary and sage.  Stir.  Sprinkle flour on meat and stir.
Continue cooking the meat while stirring, to brown the flour a bit.  Add
vinegar and water.  Stir thoroughly.  Cover, lower heat, and simmer 1 hour
or until meat is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Stir frequently during cooking, and add a little hot water if necessary to
prevent burning.

NOTES:

*  An Easy Lamb Stew -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure where
she got it. It's not a typical cacciatore (i.e. smothered in tomato sauce);
instead, it's tart and tastes of herbs.  It smells great when it's cooking.
It's very easy to make.  Yield:  Serves 4 to 6.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20-30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
