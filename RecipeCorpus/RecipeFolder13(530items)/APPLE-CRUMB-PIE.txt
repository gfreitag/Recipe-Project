Title: APPLE CRUMB PIE
Categories: Pies, Usenet
Yield: 1 pie
1/4 C  Flour, all-purpose
1/4 C  Butter, melted
1/2 C  Nuts, chopped
-(walnuts, pecans, etc.)
1    Pie crust
4 C  Apples, tart
2 T  Butter
3/4 C  Sugar
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1 t  Cinnamon
1/2 C  Brown sugar
Core, peel and slice the apples.  Melt the butter and mix the rest in with
it. Pour over apples and mix around so the apples are coated. Put in an
unbaked pie shell.

Combine brown sugar, flour, melted butter and nuts.  Spread over top of the
filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes, or until it is bubbling.

NOTES:

*  One-crust apple-crumb pie -- The pie can also be frozen and then baked,
right from the freezer, at 360 for 90 minutes.  The pies will keep a very
long time in the freezer and not be worse for wear.

*  PS:  For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but the
convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday when the mood
grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a big plastic bag.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
