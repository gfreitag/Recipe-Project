Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
2 t  Lemon juice
1 C  Yogurt, plain
2    Egg whites
2/3 C  Sugar (or vary based
-on sweetness of fruit)
1/2 C  Orange juice
2 C  Fruit, cut into pieces
Combine sugar and orange juice in a saucepan.  Heat and stir until sugar is
dissolved.  Set aside to cool.

Whirl fruit and lemon juice in blender until fruit is pulp.  Add yogurt,
blending well.  With motor running, add cooled orange juice mixture.

Pour into a 9-inch square, flat pan and place in freezer for two hours or
until mixture is frozen into a slush.  Break up mixture and put in mixer
bowl. Beat until smooth, adding eggs one at a time. Continue beating until
light and fluffy.

Return to pan or freezer-proof dessert containers and freeze until firm,
about one hour.

For very juicy fruit, such as raspberries or frozen fruit, the orange juice
may be decreased in proportion to the amount of juice.  Increase the lemon
juice by 1 teaspoon for each 1/8 cup the orange juice is decreased.
