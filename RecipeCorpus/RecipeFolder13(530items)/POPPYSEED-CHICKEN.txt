Title: POPPYSEED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 C  Ritz cracker pieces
-(about 1 "tube" of
-crackers)
2 oz Butter
2 T  Poppy seeds
2 C  Chicken, cooked
-(white or dark meat)
13 oz Sour cream
13 oz Cream of chicken soup
-(1 can of condensed soup)
Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and put it on the bottom of a
casserole dish big enough to hold it.

Combine sour cream and condensed chicken soup in a pan and pour it over the
chicken in an even layer.

In the same pan, (save dishes!) melt the butter and add broken-up crackers
and poppy seeds. Mix together and distribute over the chicken and sauce.

Bake at about 325 degrees F. for 20-30 minutes, until the topping is brown,
the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is hot.

NOTES:

*  Chicken casserole with poppy seeds -- This is an easy and good way to
use some cooked chicken. I got the recipe from my grandmother, who "hates
to cook" but nevertheless seems to do a great job...

*  Somehow this doesn't seem very nutritious.  Serve it with lots of
vegetables.  Broccoli and carrots go well.  Use more or less of the
ingredients to taste, or depending on how many you are serving.  Use
different soups. Add mushrooms. Add other stuff. Have fun.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  40 minutes.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
