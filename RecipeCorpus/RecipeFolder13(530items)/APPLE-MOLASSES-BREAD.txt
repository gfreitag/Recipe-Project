Yield: 1 loaf
1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground
1/4 t  Nutmeg, ground

1/4 C  Dark molasses (treacle)
1 C  Raisins
1/2 C  Nuts, chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar
until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
addition.

Combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside. Combine
applesauce and molasses.

Add dry ingredients alternately with applesauce mixture  to egg mixture.
Fold in raisins and nuts. Pour into a greased 9 1/4 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4 inch
loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted
into the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes, remove from pan and
continue cooling on a wire rack.

NOTES:

back of a label for a baking loaf pan.  It is easy to make and because of
the molasses it is very fragrant while baking. Yield: 1 large loaf.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, 30 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
