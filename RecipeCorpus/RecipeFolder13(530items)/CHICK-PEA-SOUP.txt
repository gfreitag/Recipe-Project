Title: CHICK-PEA SOUP
Categories: Soups, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 C  Olive oil
2 t  Salt
Lemon juice
1 lb Chick peas
2 T  Baking soda
4 sm Onions (or fewer),
-chopped
Soak the chick peas in water overnight.  Drain the chick peas and sprinkle
the baking soda on them. Stir them a little and let them stand for one
hour.

Rinse the chick peas with plenty of water.  Put them in a pot and cover
them with water. Bring them to a boil, then lower heat to medium. Skim off
the scum that forms on the surface, and then add the onions. Cover and cook
on low heat for about two hours or until the chick peas are soft. (If
necessary, add some hot water into the pot while the chick peas are
cooking).

Add the olive oil and salt, and cook for a few more minutes.  Serve with a
dash of lemon juice, plenty of fresh bread and, if you like, a chunk of
feta cheese on the side.

You're supposed to remove the skin off the chick peas.  I was never able to
do it (it comes off only with some difficulty, and you have to do it for
each individual pea), but it doesn't seem to affect the dish adversely.

You know that the soup is done when the chick peas begin to dissolve,
making the soup rather thick. This might not give the dish a very
attractive appearance, but the taste is an entirely different matter.

NOTES:
