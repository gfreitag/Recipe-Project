Title: CHINESE MARINATED MEAT
Categories: Meats, Condiments, Usenet
Yield: 1 cup
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
1/4 C  Pineapple juice,
-unsweetened (or use
-the juice from the
-can of pineapple chunks)
1/2 t  White pepper
2 T  Ginger root, cut into
-thin (1/8-inch) slices
1/4 C  Dry sherry (cooking
-sherry will do)
2 T  Light soy sauce
1/4 C  Dark soy sauce
2 1/2 t  Sugar
1/4 C  Hoisin sauce
1 t  Curry powder
--------------------------------MEAT SKEWERS--------------------------------
12 oz Pineapple chunks
1 1/2 lb Sirloin tip
Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.

Cut meat into bite-size chunks and place on skewers with 2 or 3 chunks of
pineapple in between the meat pieces.  Marinate the skewers overnight, in a
covered container, in the refrigerator.

To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of the
chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on skewers is even
better.

NOTES:

*  Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade -- After frequenting a local Chinese
restaurant, I finally asked for the recipe for the marinade for the meat
that came on skewers on the pu pu platter. I was given a list of
ingredients with instructions like "heavy on this, light on this". I
devised my own amounts from this list. I served it to my family and they
enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending it to mod.recipes.

*  You may need to double the marinade recipe.  I use a Tupperware
container made especially for marinating. Any container will do, but it's
tough having to turn over all those skewers.

*  The hoisin sauce, ginger root and light soy sauce should be available in
any good grocery store.  Comments, revisions and/or additions will be
appreciated.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
