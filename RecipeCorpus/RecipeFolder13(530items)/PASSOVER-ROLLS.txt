Title: PASSOVER ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Jewish, Usenet
Yield: 12 rolls
1 C  Water
1/2 C  Peanut oil
4    Eggs
2 C  Matzah meal
1 t  Salt
1 T  Sugar
Combine matzah meal with salt and sugar.  In a medium saucepan, bring oil
and water to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the matzah
meal, mixing well.

Beat in the eggs thoroughly, one at a time (this is where it starts to get
sticky).  Let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes (can be refrigerated).

With well-oiled hands, shape it into rolls and place on a well-greased
cookie sheet (you will have to keep re-oiling your hands). Bake in a
preheated 375 degree F. oven for 50 minutes or until golden brown.

NOTES:

*  Bread-like Passover rolls -- This recipe comes from a poster-sized sheet
of recipes printed by Manischewitz many years ago (probably before I was
born). Besides making reasonably good mock "rolls," it's also great fun for
kids to make (very sticky!).

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  35 minutes preparation (including waiting), 50 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
