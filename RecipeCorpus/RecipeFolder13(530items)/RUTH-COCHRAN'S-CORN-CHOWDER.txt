Title: RUTH COCHRAN'S CORN CHOWDER
Categories: Soups, Usenet
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 C  Water
Salt and pepper
16 oz Canned corn
-(cream-style or regular)
2 C  Milk
3 T  Butter
1 sm Onion, chopped
1 C  Ham, cubed
3 md Potatoes,
-peeled and cubed
Melt butter and saute onions until soft and transparent.  Add the ham,
potatoes, water, salt and pepper (to taste) and cook, covered, until the
potatoes are done (easily pierced with a fork).  Add the corn and the milk
and heat thoroughly. Do NOT boil. Serve with fresh bread.

NOTES:

*  A hearty corn soup -- This recipe comes from my mother-in-law and is a
family favorite.  It makes a good, hearty meal when served with fresh bread
or rolls. Yield: Serves 2-4 people.

*  If you don't have any ham, you can substitute 6 slices of bacon.  Fry up
the bacon and remove from the pan.  Saute the onions in the bacon fat and
continue from there.  Crumble the bacon and add with the milk and corn
instead of with the potatoes. Bacon gives a slightly different flavor. Note
that many stores offer canned ham in 6 3/4-oz cans, packaged like tuna
fish.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
