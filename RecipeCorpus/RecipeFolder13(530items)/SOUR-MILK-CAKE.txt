chocolate cake out of it. This cake is from the "Farm Journal's Choice
Chocolate Recipes" cookbook, and was originally posted to net.cooks by

It is moist and rich and does not need frosting Mint chocolate ice cream
and a slab of this cake makes an outrageous dessert.

enough milk to make about 1 cup.
