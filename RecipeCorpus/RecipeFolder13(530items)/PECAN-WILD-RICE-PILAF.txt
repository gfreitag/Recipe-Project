for 50 minutes or until rice is tender. Do not overcook. Remove to a large
bowl.

While the rice is cooking, in another saucepan bring about 2 1/4 cups water

to low and simmer 15 minutes, or until pilaf is tender. Remove from heat,
let rest 15 minutes, and add to the (cooked) wild rice. Add remaining
ingredients and toss well. Serve at room temperature.
