NOTES:

*  A simple Mexican-style casserole with beef and cheese -- This a
conglomeration of several of my favorite Mexican casserole recipes.  I took
what I liked best from each one and this is what it turned out to be.  My
family devoured it instantly and  completely, and it has become one of our
favorites.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  You can adjust the seasonings to suit your own tastes; I listed
conservative amounts (for me, anyway!).  You can also add salsa (homemade
is best) to the casserole, if desired. Serve with fried rice (plain or
flavored) and green salad.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
