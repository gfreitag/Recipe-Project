Title: CHICKEN TARRAGON
Categories: Poultry, Herbs, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 C  Cream, heavy
1 t  Tarragon
1 pn Salt and pepper
4    Chicken breasts
3 T  Butter
1 C  Vermouth, dry
2 t  Mustard, dijon
Remove the skin and bone from the chicken breasts.  Pound with a meat
mallet until chicken breast is of even thickness.

Melt the butter in a skillet.  Saute chicken 4 minutes on each side. Remove
the chicken to a warm dish while you prepare the sauce.

Mix the dijon mustard into the vermouth and pour the mixture into the
skillet. Stir to dissolve the browned bits in the pan. Reduce volume of
liquid by half over medium heat. Add the heavy cream and the tarragon. Stir
continuously, 5 to 10 minutes, until mixture thickens.

Arrange the chicken on a serving dish and pour some of the cream sauce over
it.  Serve the remaining sauce on the side.

For a different flavor, saute about 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms before de-
glazing the skillet with the vermouth.

If you are daring, you can cook the chicken breasts at the same time you
are making the sauce, using one hand for each. This will make the chicken
be warmer when served.
