Title: TARAMOSALATA
Categories: Spreads, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1 T  Onion, finely chopped
-(or more to taste)
Black pepper,
-freshly milled
1/2 C  Smoked cod roe
1 C  Olive oil
1    Garlic clove
2 T  Lemon juice
2 T  Chopped parsley
Cover cod roes for a few minutes in boiling water to loosen skins, then
peel them.

Crush garlic and rub around a mixing basin (bowl).  Discard garlic.  Dice
roe, add about 2 T oil, and stand for 15 minutes to soften. Pass roe
through sieve into garlic-rubbed basin and beat until smooth.

Add half the lemon juice, gradually beat in the rest of the oil, adding the
remainder of the lemon juice at the half-way stage.  Stir in the chopped
onion, parsley and black pepper to taste.  Chill and serve.

NOTES:

*  Greek smoked fish-roe pate -- This is a particular family favorite at my
parents' house.  The word Taramosalata means "fish egg salad" in Greek.

*  This recipe can be made with any kind of fish roe.  Greeks sometimes add
about 1/2 cup of cooked potatoes.

*  The only tricky bit comes in adding the oil:  you should do it a little
at a time like preparing mayonnaise, and be careful not to let the oil
separate. If it does begin to separate, add another dash of lemon juice.

*  Taramosalata will keep for about a week under refrigeration.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
