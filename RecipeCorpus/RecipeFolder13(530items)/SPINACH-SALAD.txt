NOTES:

*  A spinach salad for summertime -- This is one of the scrap pieces of
paper floating around in my kitchen. I think it came from Kay Dasch. Yield:
serves 6.

*  You can toss the salad without the dressing and keep it in the
refrigerator until you are ready to serve it. Don't add the dressing until
you serve the salad or the spinach will wilt.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation.
: Precision:  measure the dressing ingredients.
