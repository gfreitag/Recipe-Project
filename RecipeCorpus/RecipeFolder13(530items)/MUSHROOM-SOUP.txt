Title: MUSHROOM SOUP
Categories: Soups, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 T  Butter
2 T  Flour
2 T  Lemon juice
Salt, white pepper
8 oz Mushrooms
2 1/2 C  Milk
1    Stock cube
-(beef or chicken)
Wash mushrooms and cut into slices.  Melt butter over medium heat.  Fry the
mushrooms for about 2 minutes or so.

Stir in flour to form a thick-ish paste.  Gradually stir in the milk and
stock while heating. Add the lemon juice and seasoning, bring to the boil.
Simmer for about 10 minutes (or longer if you want).

NOTES:

*  Quick and easy mushroom soup -- This is based on a recipe my sister got
from her high school cookery class.  It's easy to make whilst constructing
a more involved main course. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  My sister insists on using a chicken stock cube, but I prefer beef.
Chicken gives you a lighter colour, but I prefer the darker colour given by
the beef.  (Of course, real stock is better, but takes time to prepare)

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
