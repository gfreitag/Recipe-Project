Title: SWEET CUCUMBER CHUNKS
Categories: Pickles, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
5 t  Salt (non-iodized salt
-is best)
4 C  Vinegar
10    Cucumbers, not too fat
8 C  Sugar
2 T  Pickling spice
-(see note)
Wash cucumbers and place in large pot.  Pour boiling water over cucumbers
until they are covered.  Let stand for 24 hours and then drain.  Repeat
this procedure for three (3) days. The cucumbers will be rather slimy after
this. This is normal.

On the fourth day drain and slice into bite-size chunks.  If the cucumbers
are fat you can halve or quarter the chunks so you end up with bite-size
pieces.

Combine the remaining ingredients.  Bring mixture to a boil, stirring
frequently.  Pour cooked mixture over the cucumber pieces.  Return to a
boil, but just a boil. Do not cook. Pour cucumbers and liquid mixture into
canning jars and seal. Jars should be sealed in a boiling water bath for 10
minutes.

NOTES:

*  A very sweet cucumber pickle -- My wife's grandmother provided us with
this wonderful pickle recipe. Yield: Serves many.

*  These are best if they sit for a month or so after canning, to give them
time to work.  If you use iodized salt, they are more likely to get cloudy
during that month.

*  If your grocery does not sell pre-mixed pickling spice mixtures, try
various combinations of mustard seeds, celery seeds, coriander, dill, or
any other strongly-flavored spices that you like.

*  We increase this recipe by several times.  Last year we used about 200
cucumbers.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  4 days of soaking.  About 1-2 hours of real work.
: Precision:  Approximate measure ok.
