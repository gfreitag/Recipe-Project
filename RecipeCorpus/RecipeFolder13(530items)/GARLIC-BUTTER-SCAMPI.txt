NOTES:

*  I serve this over fettucini (1 1/2 lbs for a full batch).  To save the
trouble of de-veining shellfish, you can have two or three big ones for
each person, and use small bay shrimp for the remainder.

*  This recipe comes from the "Garlic Lovers' Cookbook," published by the
Gilroy Garlic Festival, P.O.  Box 2311, Gilroy, California, USA.  North
America mail order price is $9.45 (paperback) or $12.45 (spiral) for each
of the 2 volumes.

: Difficulty:  Moderate.
: Time:  45 minutes cooking, 1 1/2 hours for de-veining scampi, 10 minutes
for other preparation.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
