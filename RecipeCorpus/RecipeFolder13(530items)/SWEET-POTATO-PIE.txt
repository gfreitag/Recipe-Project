Title: SWEET POTATO PIE
Categories: Pies, Holiday, Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
2    Eggs
1 t  Vanilla
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1    Pie crust, unbaked
1 1/2 lb Sweet potatoes
1 C  Sugar, granulated
12 T  Butter, unsalted
-(or use corn-oil
-margarine)
Boil potatoes until tender (20-30 minutes).  Drain and peel.

In a blender, put the potatoes, sugar and butter.  Mix up a little, then
add eggs, vanilla and nutmeg. Blend ingredients together well, until
mixture is very smooth. Pour into unbaked pie shell and bake at 375 degrees
F. for 45-55 minutes until filling is set.

NOTES:

*  This is an extremely simple and extremely good pie recipe.  You can even
cheat and use store-bought pie crusts, in which case the whole thing takes
about 5 minutes to put together.  Yield:  Serves 3-8.

*  If you don't want to make your own pie shell, I find that the Pet Ritz
factory pie shells work well.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
