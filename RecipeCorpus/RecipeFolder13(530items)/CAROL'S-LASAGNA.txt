Grease the inside of the baking pan with a light vegetable oil.  Now make
three filling layers.  For each, put down 1/3 of the noodles, in two
layers. Then spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on the noodles. Then
sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Finally, top with 1/3 of the

5-10 minutes before serving.
