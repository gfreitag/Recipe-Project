Title: STEVE'S MEAT LOAF
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
------------------------------------LOAF------------------------------------
1/3 C  Marinara sauce
-(or spaghetti sauce
-or pizza sauce)
2    Garlic cloves,  minced
2 t  Seasoned salt (or use
-a mixture of salt,
-pepper, cayenne and
-celery seed)
2 lb Hamburger
1    Egg
1 ds Nutmeg
1/4 t  Black pepper
1/2 C  Mushroom soup
-concentrate, canned
1/2 C  Onion, chopped
1/2 C  Bread crumbs
-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
1/2 C  Sour cream
1/4 C  Drippings (from
-baking the loaf)
8 oz Canned mushroom soup
-concentrate (use the
-rest of the can)
3 oz Mushrooms, sliced
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Mix all ingredients together well, shape
into loaf and put into a pan. If you use a roasting rack instead of a bread
pan, the loaf will be less greasy and you can use some of the drippings to
make the sauce. Bake 20 minutes uncovered at 425 degrees F. Turn down the
oven to 375 degrees F. and continue baking, uncovered, for 55 more minutes.

MAKE THE SAUCE:  Fry the mushrooms in the drippings and then combine the
drippings and mushrooms with the mushroom soup and sour cream.  Heat this
mixture in a sauce pan.  When meatloaf is done, put on a plate, cover with
sauce, slice and eat.

reviews from guests.  Yield:  serves 4-6.
