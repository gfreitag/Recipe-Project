Title: BEEF STROGANOFF
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 t  Nutmeg
1 T  Chives, chopped
1 t  Garlic, minced
-(or more to taste)
Salt
Pepper
Pasta (or steamed rice)
1 1/2 lb Round steak or
-other beef fillet
8 oz Mushrooms (canned),
-sliced
12 oz Sour cream
4 oz Wine, white
2 T  Onion, chopped
2 T  Worcestershire sauce
Cut meat into strips about 1/2-inch thick by 2 inches long.  Saute the
onions in butter until brown. Place meat in pan with onions. Sear quickly
in frying pan along with onion. (This seals the juices inside.) Avoid
overcooking the meat.

Add mushrooms and stir in the wine, chives and garlic for about 5 minutes.
Finally add sour cream, Worcestershire sauce and chives, and simmer until
it almost boils. Serve on noodles or steamed white rice.

NOTES:

*  Sumptuous beef stroganoff -- This easy recipe can be served either on
steamed rice or on noodles.

*  You may want to vary the thickness of the sauce.  I do this by adding
sour cream to thicken, or adding wine to lighten.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 to 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
