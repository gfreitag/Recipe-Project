NOTES:

*  No-bake, 3-layer (chocolate covered) bars -- Nanaimo bars are a
traditional Canadian dessert, though nobody is certain where the tradition
came from. Laura Secord is a Canadian candy company; their cook book says
this about the origin of these fattening delicacies:

"A version of these no-bake bars developed in the Canadian kitchens of a
well-known food company, was christened by them Nanaimo bars after the city
of that name on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo (from sne-ny-mo, a local Indian
term for a loose confederation of five bands) started as a Hudson Bay
Trading Post in 1849."

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
