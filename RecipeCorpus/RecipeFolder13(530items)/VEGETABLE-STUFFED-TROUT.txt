Title: VEGETABLE-STUFFED TROUT
Categories: Fish, Usenet
Yield: 2 servings
1/2    Onion
Assorted seasonings
-(salt, pepper,
-bay leaf, basil,
-dried parsley, etc.)
2    Trout, about
-1/2 pound each
1 T  Margarine
2 T  Lemon juice
1    Green pepper
Clean and scale the trout.  Wash carefully.  You can leave the heads on if
you like.

Cut up the green pepper and onion into bite-size chunks.  If you're feeling
experimental, try adding a bit of tomato (or whatever).

Melt the margarine in a microwaveable dish big enough to accommodate the
fish. Stir in the lemon juice. Roll the fish around in the lemon-butter
mixture and sprinkle with seasonings to taste. Add the vegetables to the
dish (don't put them in the trout yet).

Cover loosely to prevent spatters (a paper plate or wax paper works fine)
and microwave on high power for about 7 minutes, or until the fish is
opaque and flaky and the vegetables are tender. Flip the fish over and stir
the vegetables once or twice during this time. Scoop some of the vegetables
and sauce into the body cavity before serving.

NOTES:

*  Stuffed trout cooked in a microwave oven -- I prefer fish cooked in the
microwave to ordinary baked fish, because it doesn't get dried out.  The
texture is similar to what you get when you cook fish wrapped in aluminum
foil outdoors over a wood fire. It's also much less work!

*  This recipe is for a standard 600 to 700 watt microwave oven.

: Difficulty:  easy if you know how to clean a trout.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
