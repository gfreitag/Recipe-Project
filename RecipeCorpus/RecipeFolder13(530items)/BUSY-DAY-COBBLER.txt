Title: BUSY DAY COBBLER
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
13 oz Tart cherries
-(one normal U.S. can)
2 T  Sugar (to sweeten
-and thicken; use less
-or more as needed)
1/4 C  Butter (or margarine,
-if you must)
1/2 C  Sugar
2/3 C  Milk
1 C  Flour
2 t  Baking powder
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drain cherries, saving liquid.

Cream butter and sugar together.  Alternately add in milk and sifted dry
ingredients.  Pour into a buttered and floured casserole dish.  Top evenly
with cherries.  Sprinkle sugar on top and cover with saved liquid/juice.
Bake 45-50 minutes.

The batter will expand and surround the cherries so they're evenly mixed
throughout the cobbler.  The juice will congeal to fruity and pudding-like.
Serve warm topped with cream, milk or ice cream.  (I prefer milk).  If any
is left, it's good cold, too.

NOTES:

*  An extremely quick cherry cobbler dessert -- This recipe came from a PTA
recipe collection from my Aunt's school a number of years ago.  It's not a
true, classic cobbler, but I think it's better.  My favorite dessert!

*  As the name implies, this is a very quick recipe to make.  Depending on
how soft the butter is to start with, or whether or if you use a food
processor (I don't, but it should work) this recipe takes only 5 to 10
minutes to mix.

*  You can use any unsweetened canned fruit for this recipe.  You can also
use frozen fruit, by thawing it before adding to the pan. Berries or
peaches are standard substitutes. Yesterday I made one with crushed
pineapple.  I used brown, rather than white sugar atop the fruit. It tasted
very much like pineapple upside down cake (though the appearance was a bit
different).

: Difficulty:  easy, I've been making this since I was about 8 or 9.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
