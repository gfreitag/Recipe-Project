Title: SPICY KEBABS
Categories: Meats, Barbecue, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1 t  Cumin, ground
1/2 t  Pepper
4    Onions
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 t  Lemon juice
1 T  Brown sugar
1 T  Soy sauce
2 lb Pork or lamb
-(boneless), lean, cut
-into 1 1/2 inch cubes
1/4 C  Peanut butter, smooth
1 t  Coriander, ground
1 1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Cayenne pepper (or more,
-to taste)
Grate the onions.  This is best done using a food processor.  Mincing is
not good enough; you want to end up with something wet and mushy. Don't
stick your nose into the food processor.

Put all the ingredients into a large bowl, mix well, and cover. Refrigerate
for several hours, mixing occasionally.

Put meat cubes on skewers, keeping as much of the onion mixture on them as
you can. Grill over hot coals, turning to brown each side, for 20 to 25
minutes or until meat is cooked through. (Lamb should still be slightly
pink; pork should not.)

NOTES:

*  Spicy pork or lamb kebabs -- I copied this from a newspaper or magazine
a long time ago; I forget where. It was originally for pork, but it's good
with lamb, too.

*  You could probably put some vegetables (onions, bell peppers) on the
skewers between the meat chunks; watch out that the veggies don't burn.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 30 minutes
cooking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
