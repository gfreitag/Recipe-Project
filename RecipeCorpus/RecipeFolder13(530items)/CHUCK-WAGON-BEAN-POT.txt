Title: CHUCK-WAGON BEAN POT
Categories: Crockpot, Soups, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
7 oz Green chili salsa
-(up to 10 oz; or use
-tomato sauce, canned
-or stewed tomatoes)
1 lb Bean (any variety), dry
1    Ham hock or shank
1 lg Onion, chopped
6 C  Water
1 t  Salt
Rinse the beans and remove any foreign matter.  Mix all ingredients in the
cooking vessel.

IF USING A SLOW-COOKER:  Cover, set temperature at low, and forget for at
least 10 hours.  If you have only half a day, cook the mixture 5 or more
hours on high.

IF USING A STOVE:  Heat all ingredients to boiling with pot uncovered. Turn
down heat, cover, and simmer gently, adding enough boiling water to keep
beans well covered. Most bean varieties will be done in 2 to 3 hours.

When beans are done, take out ham bone, cut off the meat and put it back
into the pot. Serve hot with corn bread or muffins. Green chili salsa is a
Mexican sauce made from green chili peppers, onions, vinegar and other
ingredients.

NOTES:

*  A Hearty Bean Stew -- I got this recipe from "A Primer on Bean Cookery"
by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board and other organizations. This
savory stew, featuring ham and beans, borrows its robust seasonings from
the chuck wagon cooks of the old western cattle ranges. The secret is long,
slow cooking, and your electric slow-cooker is ideal for the job. Just
follow the directions that come with your particular model. If you don't
have one, slow-cook the mixture on top of the stove in a heavy pot with a
lid.

: Difficulty:  Easy
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, many hours cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
