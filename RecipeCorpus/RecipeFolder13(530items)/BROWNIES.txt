Title: BROWNIES
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1 T  Vanilla extract
1 1/2 C  Flour
2 C  Walnuts, coarsely
-chopped (optional)
8 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
-(8 squares)
1/2 lb Butter
5    Eggs
2 1/2 C  Sugar
Grease a 13x9 inch pan and pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Melt the
chocolate and the butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering
water.  Whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool while beating eggs.

Beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla at high speed for a full 10 minutes. Blend
in the chocolate-and-butter mixture at low speed.  Add flour, beating just
to blend. Stir in walnuts, if desired.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes.  Do not overbake.  The brownies are done when a
toothpick inserted into the center comes out slightly dirty.  Cool in pan,
then cut into squares.

NOTES:

*  Serious chocolate brownies -- This is an adaptation of the "Scrumptious
Brownies" recipe found on a box of Baker's unsweetened chocolate.  I've
reduced the amounts of sugar and flour from the original, which I find
makes for a very fudgey brownie. Yield: 32 brownies.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
