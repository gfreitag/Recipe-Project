Cream together the shortening and sugar.  Beat in the eggs, salt and
flavorings.  Stir in the flour until blended.  Chill in the refrigerator
for an hour or two.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out on a floured surface to a
thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut with the cookie cutters of your
choice (this was always a cause for argument in our family). Bake on
ungreased cookie sheets until tan around the edges, about 8-10 minutes.
Allow to cool.

Make the frosting by beating together the sugar, milk and vanilla until
smooth.  Divide and color each portion.  Frost the cookies.

NOTES:

*  Frosted cookie-cutter cookies -- My mom got this recipe many years ago
in a cookbook that came in installments, so it didn't have a name on the
binder and I don't know what it was called. She had us (the kids) make
these cookies every year. Yield: 2-4 dozen.

*  These cookies are about the only ones I know that taste better cooked
and cold than as raw dough.

*  Cinnamon red hots make good eyes for animals or Santas.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 15 minutes rolling and
baking.
