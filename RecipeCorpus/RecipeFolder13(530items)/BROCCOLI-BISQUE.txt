Title: BROCCOLI BISQUE
Categories: Soups, Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
1 t  Salt
2 t  Curry powder (or less)
1 ds Pepper
2 T  Lime juice
8    Lemon slices, (optional)
1/2 C  Sour cream
1 T  Chives, snipped
-(optional)
1 1/4 lb Broccoli (fresh),
-trimmed and cut up
-(okay to use more)
4 C  Chicken broth
-(2 cans of canned broth,
-or use fresh stock)
1 md Onion
2 T  Butter
Place the cut broccoli in a large saucepan along with the broth, onion,
butter, salt, curry powder and pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and
simmer, covered, for 8 to 12 minutes or until broccoli is just tender.

Place about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the mixture at a time into a blender
container. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour into bowl or another large
pan.  Repeat with remaining mixture. BE CAREFUL. THE HOT LIQUID MAY SCALD
YOU.  Stir in the lime juice.

Now you can either cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours to serve cold
(great in warm weather), or you can go right ahead and serve it hot (great
in cold weather). Once ladled out, you can garnish with a thin slice of
lemon, a small dollop or sour cream, and a sprinkling of chives.

NOTES:

*  A broccoli soup (hot or cold) -- This recipe is from my mom.  It's been
a hit every time she or I have served it. It is rather spicy - not for the
timid or faint-of-heart.

*  You can refrigerate unused portions for serving later, but it doesn't
keep well for long. I like to blend it pretty well, so that the texture is
quite smooth. Some people like it a little chunkier.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  45 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
