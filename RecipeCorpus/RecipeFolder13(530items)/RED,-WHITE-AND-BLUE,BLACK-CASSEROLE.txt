Categories: Entrees, Vegetables, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
-cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 lg White onion, cut into
-thin slices (optional)
3 lg Tomatoes, cut
-into 1/2-inch slices
1 1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese,
Cut the eggplant lengthwise once, then slice crosswise into semi-disks
about 3/4 inch thick.

In a shallow casserole dish (about 2 in deep), stand some slices of
eggplant on the narrow cut edge, to make a row, then follow this with
slices of tomato, then slices of mozzarella cheese. Repeat until the whole
dish is full.  It should appear from the top to have bands of red, white
and black.

Use your favorite seasoning (basil/oregano is the default), and bake until
bubbly (about 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  Eggplant casserole with tomato and cheese -- From "Victory Garden
Cookbook" maybe? Anyway, that's an excellent source for ideas...

*  You may wish to put a layer of onions on the bottom, horizontally,
before you put the eggplant in the pan.

*  This only works with European-style eggplant; Japanese and Asian
eggplants are too narrow.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
