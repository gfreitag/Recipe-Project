NOTES:

*  Delicious high-fiber oatmeal drop cookies -- These oatmeal cookies are
for cookie lovers to splurge with. Not only are they great tasting, but
they are very high in fiber content and easy to make. The recipe is mine
and is based on several different ideas in different cookbooks as how to
best to make them. In fun, I call them "Invisible Oatmeal Cookies" because
they are wont to disappear whenever unguarded. Enjoy.

*  If any children (young or old) live within smelling distance of your
stove, make extra cookies for when they suddenly show up for an unexpected
visit.

*  The recipe may be halved, doubled, or whatever without harm.  The batter
as well as the baked cookies freeze well. Thaw batter on countertop. Thaw
cookies either in microwave or in oven.
