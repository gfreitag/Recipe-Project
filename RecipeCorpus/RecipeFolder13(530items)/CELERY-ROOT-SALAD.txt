Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD
Categories: Salads, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 t  Black pepper,
-freshly ground
1    Garlic clove, crushed
3/4 t  Dill weed, dried
-(use more if fresh)
1/3 C  Scallions, minced
1/3 C  Parsley, minced
2 lb Celery root
-(also called celeriac)
4 C  Water (salted), boiling
6 T  Olive oil
3 T  White wine vinegar
1 t  Salt
2 t  Sugar
1 1/4 t  Mustard,  dry
Peel the celery root and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes.  Add the cubed celery
root to the boiling salted water and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain.

Combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk or shake to make a dressing.
Pour the dressing over the cooked celery root and toss.  Refrigerate at
least two hours before serving.

Celery root (also called celeriac) is sometimes hard to find.  Try to get
ones about the size of a large fist; smaller ones have too much waste, and
bigger ones are often pithy. This vegetable is not worth eating raw.

NOTES:

*  Cooked celery root in vinaigrette -- This salad has an intense celery
flavor.  The taste is so strong that it should be served only with other
strongly flavored foods.  It would overwhelm veal, but would go well with a
lamb roast.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
