MAKE PASTRY:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease the bottom and
sides of a 9-inch-diameter, 3-inch deep springform pan.

Prepare the pastry by stirring flour and sugar together in a bowl.  Cut in
butter, egg yolk and extract.  Work the dough (which will be very crumbly)
with hands to complete the mixing.  Evenly press the dough on the bottom
and up the sides (to within about 1/2 inch of the top) of the springform
pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove and set aside to cool while preparing the filling.

MAKE FILLING:  Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F.  Beat the
cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth and soft. Beat in the sugars,
flour, spices and pumpkin until well blended. Add egg yolks and eggs one at
a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract, beat in
well. Stir in the cream.

Pour filling into the pastry crust.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Without opening
the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. and leave the
cheesecake in the oven for an additional 1 hour and 15 minutes.  At the end
of the baking time, turn off the oven, but leave the cheesecake sitting
inside (without opening the door) until the oven cools (about 2 to 3
hours). Remove from the oven, refrigerate overnight.
