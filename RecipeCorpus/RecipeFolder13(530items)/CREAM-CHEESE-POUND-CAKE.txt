Title: CREAM CHEESE POUND CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
3 C  Cake flour, sifted
1/4 t  Salt
1 1/2 t  Almond extract
1 t  Vanilla extract
3/4 lb Butter
3 C  Sugar, granulated
1/2 lb Cream cheese
6 lg Eggs
Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees F.  Cream the butter, sugar and cheese
together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add salt, vanilla and
almond extract. Beat well. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after
each.

Stir in flour.  Don't be vigorous; mix it just enough to incorporate the
flour.  Spoon into a greased tube pan.  Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2
hours.  Cool for 15-20 minutes, then invert the cake onto a serving dish
and remove the tube pan. If you wait too long, it will stick.
