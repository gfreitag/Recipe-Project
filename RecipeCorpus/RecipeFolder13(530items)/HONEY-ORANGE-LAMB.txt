Title: HONEY-ORANGE LAMB
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 C  Tomato puree
-(puree of 1 tomato)
3    Garlic cloves
-(or more to taste)
1/4 t  Black pepper, ground
1    Half leg of lamb,
-butterflied
1/4 C  Soy sauce
3/4 C  Pinot noir (Burgundy)
1/4 C  Orange juice
-(juice of 1 orange)
2 T  Lemon juice (juice
-of 1 lemon)
2 T  Honey
1 t  Mustard, dry
Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb in a
bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass 9x13 pan
works well). Pour the marinade over the lamb. Cover and marinate in the
refrigerator for 12 hours, turning occasionally.

Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook 20 minutes on
each side.

After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness. Contrary
to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should still be a
little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.

NOTES:

*  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This recipe is the same as Anita
Cochran's recipe for grilled butterflied leg of lamb, except that it uses a
different marinade.  I got the marinade recipe from a local wine merchant.
Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  This marinade also works well with chicken.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
