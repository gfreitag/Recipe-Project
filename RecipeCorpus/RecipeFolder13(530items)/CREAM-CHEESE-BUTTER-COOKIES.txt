Title: CREAM CHEESE BUTTER COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Usenet
Yield: 3 dozen
1    Egg yolk
4 oz Cream cheese
Raspberry jam
1/2 lb Butter
1 C  Sugar
2 1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar.  Add
the flour and egg yolk and mix well. Add the cream cheese and mix well.

Roll into balls about 5/8 inch diameter.  Place them on an ungreased cookie
sheet (the cookies don't grow when baked, so they can be somewhat close
together).  Then press your thumb into each to flatten it and make an
indentation to hold some jam.  Fill it with jam.  Bake at 350 degrees F for
15 to 20 minutes.

You can use any flavor jam you like.  The jam is the only part of the
cookie that has any texture, so I prefer using it to jelly.

Don't eat the cookies straight from the oven, or you'll probably burn your
tongue.  The jam stays hotter much longer than the cookie.
