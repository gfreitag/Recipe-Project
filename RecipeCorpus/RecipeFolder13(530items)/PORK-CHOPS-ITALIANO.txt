Title: PORK CHOPS ITALIANO
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 2 servings
1    Onion, diced
1    Bay leaf
Oil for frying
Salt and pepper
2    Pork loin chops
10 1/2 oz Tomato soup, condensed
-(1 small can)
1    Green pepper, sliced
Heat the oil in a saucepan or frying pan (choose one with a lid).  Season
both sides of the chops with salt and pepper to taste. Brown the chops
quickly on both sides. Remove from the pan.

Fry the onions until soft, but not brown.  You may need to add a little
more fat, but I prefer to use as little as possible. Return the chops to
the pan, add the tomato soup, green pepper and bay leaf. Bring to the boil,
then simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, or until the chops are cooked.

NOTES:

*  Pork chops simmered in tomato and onion -- Apologies to anyone of
Italian descent, I'm sure this dish will seem a slander on your culinary
heritage, but that's the way I learned this recipe.

As much as I like grilled pork chops, I enjoy a change.   This recipe isn't
haute cuisine, but I think it is particularly good when you get home from
work on a cold, wet evening. The preparation is fairly quick, and it leaves
you time to warm up in front of the fire with a cup of tea and read a
newspaper.

*  I serve this with rice.  If you like brown rice, it has the advantage of
taking as long to cook as the rest of the meal, so you get an uninterrupted
half-hour.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
