Prepare pie shell.  Keep chilled.

Whisk together until smooth pumpkin, about 2 T brown sugar, 1 egg, sour
cream, cinnamon and nutmeg.

In another bowl, combine corn syrup, about 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 eggs,
about 3 T butter, vanilla, lemon rind, lemon juice and salt. Stir in
pecans.

Spread the pumpkin layer into the pie shell, then carefully spoon the pecan
mixture over it.  Bake in the upper third of a preheated 425 degree F. oven
for 20 minutes, then reduce to 350 degrees F. for 20-30 minutes more.  The
filling will puff slightly, but the center will not be completely set. Cool
on a rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  Reheat in a preheated 350
degree F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
