1 c  Prepared inst van pudding
1/4 c  Applesauce
1/4 c  Water
1    Egg, beaten
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
4 c  Flour
1 tb Dry yeast
Process on "dough" cycle. The filling would be 1/2 cup melted
margarine or butter (I use 1/4 cup) topped with 1 cup brown sugar
mixed with 3 TBS cinnamon. (I add raisins and nuts.) The topping is 4
oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter or margarine (I skip this) 1/2 tsp.
vanilla, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar and a teaspoon or two of milk.
I've done these both "full fat" and "reduced fat." It's hard to tell
the difference, so we go "reduced," including using light
(Neufchatel) cream cheese. I've tried ALL the fat free cream cheeses
and NONE of them work. JUDITH PENZINER (GGMB18A)JUDITH PENZINER
