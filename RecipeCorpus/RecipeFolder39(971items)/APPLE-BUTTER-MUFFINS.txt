Title: APPLE BUTTER MUFFINS
Categories:
2 c  flour
Yield: 12 Servings
3/4 c  brown sugar
1 1/2 ts baking powder
1/4 ts baking soda
1/2 ts salt
1 ts cinnamon
1/2 ts ginger
3/4 c  apple butter
1/2 c  butter or margarine, melted
and cooled
:
1/4 c  skim milk
2    eggs, lightly beaten
3 TB honey
1 ts vanilla
1/2 c  raisins  (optional)

Preheat oven to 400 F.

In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients (the first 7 ingredients)
and make a well in the center. In smaller bowl, combine wet
ingredients (the next 6 ingredients). Pour wet mixture into the
"well" of the dry ingredients and stir just to combine (10-15
strokes). Fold in raisins with as few strokes as possible.

Spoon batter into 12 muffin cups (if you don't use muffin liners,
spray the pan with cooking spray).

Bake 20-25 minutes, until cake tester comes out clean. Remove muffin
tin to cooling rack and cool 5 mins. before removing muffins from
tin. (Do *not* let muffins cool completely in the tin.)
