Title: APPLE CAKE (KATHY COOKS)
Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 9"x9" cake
2 tb Butter or margarine
1/4 c  Honey
1/4 c  Date sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1 pn Cloves
1 pn Nutmeg
1    Apple; peeled, cored,
-- sliced about 1/8" thick
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Pitted dates
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Melt first 2 ingredients together in a 9"-square cake pan by putting
the pan with the ingredients into the oven as it is preheating.

While the ingredients are melting, mix the next 4 ingredients
together and then mix them into the melted butter and honey. Lay
apple slices in the syrup to completely cover the bottom of the cake
pan in an attractive way. (You may need more than one apple if you
use a small one.)

Fill a 1-cup measuring cup with pitted dates, but don't pack the
dates into the cup.  With the dates in the cup, fill the cup with
water, then pour both dates and water into a blender. Add 1/2 cup
more water into the blender.  Now blend till it forms a smooth, thick
paste. Add the 1/4 cup butter or margarine and blend till totally
whipped in. Put the blender mixture into a mixing bowl and add the
last 5 dry ingredients. Mix just long enough to thoroughly blend in
all the dry ingredients. Pour this batter on top of apple slices and
spread evenly in the cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40
minutes or till a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes
out clean. When done, remove from oven and immediately turn the cake
pan upside down to empty out onto a serving platter.
