This is supposed to be the REAL Buffalo Wing recipe from the Anchor
Bar in Buffalo.

The Sauce This makes enough for about 30 "wingettes". Mix all the
ingredients in a small sauce pan over low heat until the margarine is
completely melted. Sti occasionally.

The Wings Fry the wings in a deep fryer set at 375 degrees F.,
using vegetable or peanut oil. I fry 15 wings at a time for 12-15
minutes. Drain the wings for wings have been fried, pour the sauce
over them, cover the bowl, and shake to completely coat the wings.
They can be eaten now, or you can put them o for a few minutes to get
an extra-crispy coating. Serve with carrot and cel beer (Genee Cream
Ale is traditional). ** (FRANK'S, now Durkee's)
