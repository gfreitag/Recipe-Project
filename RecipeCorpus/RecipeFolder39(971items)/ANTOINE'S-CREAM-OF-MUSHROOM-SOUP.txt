Title: ANTOINE'S CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
4 tb Butter
20 md Mushrooms; sliced
1/4 c  Sherry
3 c  Chicken stock
2 c  Heavy cream
3/4 c  Sherry
Salt and pepper (to taste)
Chicken-Hazelnut Quenelles
2 tb Hazelnuts; skins removed,
- and chopped
To roast the hazelnuts you should place them on a sheet pan and put
them in a 400øF oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the outside skin
starts to break away.  Rub the hazelnuts together so that the outer
dark skins flake off. You do not want to toast them, you just want
the skin to loosen up.

In a large skillet place the butter and heat it on medium high until
it has melted.  Add the mushrooms and saut them for 4 to 5 minutes,
or until they are brown. Add the 1/4 cup of sherry and deglaze the
pan. Add the chicken stock.  Cook the ingredients on medium heat for
12 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced by 1/2.

In a small saucepan place the 3/4 cup of sherry.  Cook it on medium
high heat for 4 to 6 minutes, or until it is reduced by 3/4.

Add the reduced sherry, salt, and pepper to soup, and stir them in.

In each of 4 individual serving bowls place 3 of the Chicken-Hazelnut
Quenelles.  Ladle the soup on top. Sprinkle on the hazelnuts.
