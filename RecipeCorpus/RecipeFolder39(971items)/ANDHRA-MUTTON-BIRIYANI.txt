Categories: Other meat
Yield: 1 Servings
8 ea Chiles, serrano (or jalapeno
-;stems removed
4 c  Basmati; (or long grain
-rice)
3 lb Mutton; 1.5" cubes
2 c  Yogurt
1 1/2 cc Ginger
10 lg Garlic cloves
2 ea Cinnomon stick; 1"
14 ea Cloves
10 ea Cardomon seeds
10 sm Onions; sliced
1 1/2 c  Ghee
6 c  Water; boiling
1 ts Turmeric
3 ts Salt
Wash and soak the rice in water for 1/2 hour. Drain off the water and
tie the rice into a cloth. Add the meat to a mixture of the yogurt
and 2 tsp salt and set aside. Saute the chiles in 1 TBS ghee. Mix the
chiles, ginger, garlic, and half the cinnamon, cloves and cardamom
together and grind into a fine paste. Rub the ground spices into the
meat. Heat half the remaining ghee and add the meat and spice/yogurt
mixture and half the onions and cook over a low fire until the meat
is tender. Heat the remaining ghee and add the remaining cinnamon,
cloves and cardamom. After they have cooked for a few minutes add the
rest of the onions and fry until they are golden brown. Add the rice
and fry it until it is slightly brown. At this point, add the 6 cups
boiling water, and then the turmeric and remaining salt. Let the rice
mixture cook until the water is almost level with the grains (the
rice should be half done by then) and then add the meat and its
gravy. Do not mix them, but, after placing a tight lid on the pot,
let the biriyani simmer for 15-20 minutes. After this, mix well and
serve. Serves 8. This is almost a complete meal by itself, although
pickles, chutneys and vegetables dishes would probably be served with
it. Heat scale: Hot. ANDHRA MUTTON BIRIYANI
