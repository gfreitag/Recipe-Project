Title: ANOTHER GYROS
Categories: Lamb, Greek
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Lean ground lamb
2 sl Homemade bread, toasted and
-crumbled
1 ts Allspice, crushed
1 ts Coriander seed, crushed
1    Clove garlic, pressed
1    Onion, grated
1 ts Fresh savory, chopped
Salt, to taste
Freshly ground pepper, to
-taste
Bacon slices (optional)
In large bowl, combined all ingredients.  Mix well, kneading until
mixture is stiff.  Make fingers of meat (about 5-inches longer and
not over 2-inches in diameter). Place fingers on skewer spacing about
1-inch apart. Cook over hot coals for 10 to 15 minutes, turning
frequently until cooked through.

You may wrap the "fingers" on the skewer with sliced bacon. If anyone
tries this, let me know how it works out.

NOTE:  I have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S., but as
I have said, I view it as a "deli" item. Krinos Foods has a "gyros
kit" that is sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets.
