Title: ANTS IN THE SAND
Categories: Kids, Snacks
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Graham crackers
Chocolate sprinkles
Place graham crackers in a plastic sandwich bag and crush with a
rolling pin.  Add a few chocolate sprinkles to make ants, then seal
the bag. Give them to the kids to take outside and eat or let them
pour it into a small bowl and eat at the table--using their fingers,
of course. Variations: Add raisins (call them beetles), red hots
(ladybugs) or mini chocolate chips (spider eggs).  Source: Healthy
