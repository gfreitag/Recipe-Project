Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Pie
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
8 c  Apples, Peeled & Sliced
12 oz Frozen Apple Juice
-Concentrate
1 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 3/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 c  Apple Juice Concentrate
1/4 ts Salt
12 tb Sweet Butter
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Combine the apple slices, apple
juice and cinnamon in a large saucepan. Leave the saucepan uncovered.
Simmer over low heat until most of the liquid is absorbed into the
apples, stirring occasionally. The apples will be ready after about
30 minutes. Cool slightly. Combine the white and whole wheat flours
and salt in a bowl. Combine 1/3 of the mixture with enough of the
apple juice to form a paste. Cut the butter into the remaining flour
mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Stir in the paste. Form a
soft dough but do not knead. Roll out half the dough and fit into the
(9") Pie Plate. Fill with the cooked apples. Roll out the remaining
dough and form a top crust. Place the top crust over the filling and
press the edges together with a fork. Prick a few vents in the top
crust. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375
degrees. Bake until golden brown (15-20 minutes). Serve warm, at room
temperature or cold. Excellent with sharp cheddar or vanilla ice
cream.
