Title: AMERICAN COUNTRY BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Flour
2 1/2 ts Double-acting baking powder
2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
7 tb Butter
3/4 c  Milk
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Cut the butter into
small bits and stir them into the dry ingredients, using your finger
tips to make sure its well combined. (Note:I used a pastry
cutter.worked just as well as my fingers and lot less messy.)
Next,slowly add the milk to the mixture while stirring continually.
Once the milk has been added, knead the dough for one minute until
smooth. Roll the dough out to quarter inch thickness. Cut into
squares and place on a dry cookie sheet. Place the cookie sheet on
the middle shelf. Bake for 12 minutes and feel secure in knowing that
you have passed on a small piece of America's heritage on to your
children.
