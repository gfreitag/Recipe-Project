1 1/2 c  Rye flour
1/3 c  Cracked wheat
1 1/2 tb Sugar

order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

This barely sweet, fruity rye tastes good with scrambled eggs or in a
turkey sandwich.  For tea sandwiches, slice thin and spread with cream
cheese and toasted sliced almonds.
