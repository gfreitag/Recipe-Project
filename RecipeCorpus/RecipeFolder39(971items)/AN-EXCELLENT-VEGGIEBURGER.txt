Title: AN EXCELLENT VEGGIEBURGER
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Walnuts
1 1/2 c  Cooked rice
1    Onion
2 tb Bacon bits
2 tb BBQ sauce
x  Salt
x  Black pepper
x  Garlic powder
x  Flour
Blend the walnuts, rice, bacon bits, BBQ sauce, and spices into a
paste. Saut the onions and add them to the mix. Add enough flour so
that it forms a workable dough. Shape into patties and sprinkle flour
onto the outsides of the patties. Refrigerate for at least one hour.
Fry, or grill, or bake (they hold together reasonably well on the
grill, only slightly more crumbly than an actual hamburger is.)

Serve with extra BBQ sauce on a bun, perhaps with onion, lettuce,
tomato, or whatever else you want on it. Makes six.
