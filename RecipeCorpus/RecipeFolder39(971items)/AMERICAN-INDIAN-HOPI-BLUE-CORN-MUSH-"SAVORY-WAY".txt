Title: AMERICAN INDIAN HOPI BLUE CORN MUSH "SAVORY WAY"
Categories: Native amer, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 qt Water
Salt
1 1/2 c  Blue cornmeal
Oil, for frying
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt to taste, and whisk in
the cornmeal. Lower the heat and stir the cornmeal for 10 minutes or
until it tastes done.  The coarser the meal, the longer it will take.
Pour the cooked cereal onto a cookie sheet or into a bread pan and
set it aside to cool for an hour or so or until firm. Once it has
cooled, slice it into pieces for frying. Fry the slices in butter or
oil in a nonstick pan until lightly crisped on both sides. If this is
to be eaten as a savory, sprinkle a little red chili or paprika on
top just before serving.

This is cooked like cornmeal mush, molded in a bread pan, and then
sliced and fried. It is delicious with a clear corn flavor and odd
purple-blue color. It's good with eggs and bacon, or with butter.
