Title: APPLE & CELERY SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Head of fresh celery
2 lg Cooking apples
1 oz Butter
60 fl Stock
2 md Onions, peeled and diced
Salt and milled pepper
Milk to finish
Chopped parsley and
-browned flaked almonds
-to garnish
1 ts Soft brown sugar
In a large saucepan sweat off the diced onion in the butter. Wash,
trim and dice the celery, add to the onion and continue on a low
heat. Remove and bruises from the apples and grate them into your
pan, discarding the core. Cook for a further 10 minutes before adding
the stock, seasoning and sugar ~ beware too much salt if you are
using a stock cube. Bring to the boil, then simmer, lid on, for 30
minutes - don't over cook or the celery flavour becomes jaded and the
colours dull. Allow to cool a little before liquidising thoroughly.
Pass through a large mesh sieve to ensure there are no stringy
threads of celery remaining. Check seasoning and consistency, adding
a little milk if needed. Serve in warmed bowls, sprinkled with
parsley and the browned almond flakes.
