Title: ANISE COOKIES " ANESPLATZCHEN"
Categories: Cookies, Ethnic
Yield: 5 Dozen
3    Eggs, room temperature
1 c  Plus 2 Tbs. sugar
1 3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Anise extract
Beat eggs until fluffy in mixer bowl at medium speed. gradually beat
in sugar. Continue beating 20 minutes more ( a must ). At low speed
blend in flour, baking powder and salt. Add anise extract and beat
only to blend. Drop by teaspoonful on greased and floured baking
sheets about 1/2 inch apart. Swirl each to make a circular form. You
can bake these two ways. Either let stand on baking sheets for 8
hours at room temperature ( to dry out ) or bake immediately. Either
way bake at 325 degrees about 10 minutes or until firm looking or
set. cool on rack and store airtight. If made the first way to dry
out these are a coffee dunker cookie or if baked immediately they are
much softer and delicate.Either way they are delicious. I bake mine
the second way.
