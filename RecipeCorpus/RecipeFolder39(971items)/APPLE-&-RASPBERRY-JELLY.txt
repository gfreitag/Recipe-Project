Categories: Canning

1 c  Red raspberry juice
2 c  Bottled apple juice
5 1/4 c  Sugar
1    Sure-jell pectin
1/2 ts Butter or margarine
Recipe by: Jo Merrill
Pour juices into a 6-8 quart kettle. Measure sugar into a separate
bowl. Add the Sure-Jell and butter to juices. Bring mixture to a full
rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Quickly stir sugar
into juices and bring the mixture back to a full rolling boil--boil
for 1 minute while stirring constantly. Mixture will rise to within 2
inches of the top of the pan so make sure you stir continuosly.
Remove from the heat and skim off foam with a spoon. Fill jars to
1/8th inch from top. Wipe jar rims then cover with flat lids. Screw
lids on tightly. Use a water bath to finish sealing. Recipe (from
Bonnie Trigg of Oceanside) was a prize winner at the 1994 Del Mar, Ca
county fair.
