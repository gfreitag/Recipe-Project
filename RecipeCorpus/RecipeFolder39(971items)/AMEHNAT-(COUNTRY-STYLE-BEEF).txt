This dish is known as a 'slow cook' and is prepared over wood fires
in the villages.  Keeping the pan covered and simmering slowly
ensures that the flavors are sealed in. It is a typical method of
village cooking.

Marinade: 1. Mix the marinade ingredients together; pour over been,
and marinate for 15 minutes.

2.  Put the beef and marinade in a pan, add the water and lemongrass,
and stir to mix.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat
for about 1 1/2 hours. Do not uncover the pan until beef is almost
tender. Shake the pan once or twice during this time.

3.  When the beef is tender, add the tamarind liquid; adjust the salt
if necessary.  Cook the beef for 5 minutes more.

Serve warm with rice and other dishes.
