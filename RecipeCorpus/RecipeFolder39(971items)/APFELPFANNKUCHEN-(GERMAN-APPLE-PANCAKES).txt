Title: APFELPFANNKUCHEN (GERMAN APPLE PANCAKES)
Categories: Fruits, Penndutch, Breakfast, German
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lg Cooking apples (Yellow
-Delicious, or Granny Smith)
1/4 c  Butter
1 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg, grated
Confectioners sugar
Preheat oven to 475.  Peel, core and very thinly slice the apples: you
should have approximately 1-1/2 cups. Melt 3 T sp. of the butter over
medium low heat in a small fry pan, and saute the apples until they
are just tender.  Keep apples warm while preparing the batter.

Place a 9 or 10 inch cast-iron skillet in the oven to heat for at
least 5 minutes--the pan has to be very hot for this to work. When it
is well heated, add the remaining 2 T sp. of butter to melt and put
the skillet back in the oven;  the butter should be very hot buy not
brown when you add the apples and the batter.

Place the flour, milk, vanilla, salt and nutmeg in a blender and whirl
until smooth.  Remove the skillet from the oven, quickly arrange the
warm apple slices over the melted butter, and pour the batter evenly
over all. Bake for 15 min., reduce heat to 375 and bake 10 min
longer. The pancake will puff and climb up the sides of the pan.
Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar, then cut in wedges and serve with
maple syrup.

Note:  If you do not use apples, add 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter to
the hot skillet.
