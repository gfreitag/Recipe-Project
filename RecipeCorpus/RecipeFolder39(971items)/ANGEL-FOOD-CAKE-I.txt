275 F. oven for 30 minutes, then increase the heat to 300 F. after
the cake has risen to its full height, and bake 15 minutes longer or
until the cake shrinks slightly and is well browned. Remove from oven
and invert pan until cake is cold. Remove from pan and ice if
desired. The cake in the illustration is iced with Boiled Icing
tinted yellow, and settled in a nest of coconut tinted green.  The
breen leaves are mode with green icing. The flowers are cut from
marshmallows, and tinted with violet coloring.

Boiled icing:  Mix sugar, cream of tartar and water and cook over low
heat until syrup spins a thread (240 F). Meanwhile, add salt to egg
whites and beat with a flat beater until stiff. Pour syrup in a thin
stream over the egg whites; add flavorings.  Beat until the right
consistency to spread.
