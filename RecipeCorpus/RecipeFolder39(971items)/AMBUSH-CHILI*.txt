has won in many cook-offs, and is retired from competition. The new
recipe is called Ambush-2 Chili and has been entered now, in some 12
cook- offs and has placed each time including 3 1st's! "CHILI RULE
#1: NEVER USE BEANS IN CHILI! THEY ARE A SIDE DISH, NOT PART OF
CHILI!"

I believe this is from dandy Don Huston, down Floriday way...
