Title: APPLE DELIGHT
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 8 Servings
2    Egg
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
3 tb Flour; rounded
1 c  Apple; chunks
1/4 c  Walnuts
Beat eggs light.    Add sugar slowly and beat well. Add flour, baking
powder, salt and vanilla.  Beat. Stir in apple chunks and walnuts.
Bake in 6 x 9 inch pan (my Mom seems to have the only pan that size,
which was my great-grandmother's pan--a 7 x 11 pan or
8 x  8 works OK).

Double the recipe if you are using a 9 x 13 pan.  I have used rhubarb
instead of apples, and other fruits would work as well.
