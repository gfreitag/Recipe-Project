1.  In a skillet, sautee the garlic, onion and frying peppers in the
olive oil until onion is transluscent (about 2 min). Add the Broccoli
and let it cook until bright green.

2.  Add the rest of the peppers and the brussel sprouts/cabbage, the
tomatoes, basil and salt and pepper. Toss very well so the tomatoes
have a chance to cook. Add the grouper andcover for about 5 min.

3.  The liquid from the fish mixes with the tomatos for a kind of
sauce. Add the parsley and cover until the fish is cooked all the way
through.

4.  Take off heat and mix with the cheese. Some people may like more
than 1/2 cup of cheese so keep it handy.

5.  Serve over Cappelini.

Author's Notes: Here is a kind of throw together recipe I came up
with:

If you are entertaining you can garnish with fresh parsley and serve
with a caesar salad, garlic bread and a nice chablis. The vegetables
can vary. I've used mushrooms, spinach, cauliflower etc. Grouper
works well with this because it has a lot of flavor. I've used fresh
tuna and halibut but prefer grouper.

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: measure ingredients.
