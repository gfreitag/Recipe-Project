MMMMM-------------------ALYCE MANTIA (KRBS41A------------------------
6    Croissants; large, cut
-crosswise in 1/2" slices
8    Eggs; large, beaten slightly
2 c  Sugar
3 c  Half-and-half
1 tb Amaretto
2 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Almond paste; about 3 oz,
-cut into bits
1/2 c  Almonds; slivered
Butter a baking pan, 9x13 and place the smallest croissant rounds in a
lawyon in the bottom.  Then top with a layer of the larger ones,
until all are arranged in the pan. Whisk the eggs and sugar together
well, then whisk in the half-and-half, Amaretto and vanilla, mixing
well. Pour over the croissant rounds. Sprinkle the almond paste over
the top and push down with a spoon so that the bread absorbs the
liquid. Let set for 10-20 minutes at room temperature. Sprinkle the
almonds over the top and bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes, or until
golden and puffed. Serve warm or at room temperature.
