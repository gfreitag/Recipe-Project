Title: ANGEL'S TIP
Categories: Mixed, Drinks, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 oz White creme de cacao
1/4 oz Sweet cream
Pour creme de cacao in a pousse-cafe glass. Carefully float cream on
top, being careful not to let ingredients mix. (You can float the
cream by holding a teaspoon bottom-side up over the glass and pouring
the cream slowly over it.)

Float cherry on top of cream (also known as a King Alphonse when you
add the cherry).
