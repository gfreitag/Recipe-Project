1. For pie crust, sift flour and salt into large bowl. Cut in butter
and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add orange
rind. Sprinkle in juice and water,. 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing
with fork until flour is moistened and soft dough forms. Shape into
ball. Refrigerate, covered, 1 hour.

2. For crumb topping, mix flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and
ginger. Work in butter with fingers until mixture is crumbly.

3. For filling, peel core and cut apples into 1/2-inch slices. Put
slices in large bowl; toss with 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons flour. Add
sugar, cinnamon, orange rind, vanilla extract, nutmeg and salt. Stir
in honey; let stand 1 hour.

4. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Roll half of dough into a circle; fit in
metal, 9-inch pie pan. Trim edge. Drain liquid from apples, reserve.
Set 1/4 cup of the crumb topping aside. Layer apples with remaining
crumbs in dough-lined pan. Use crumbs like mortar to build fruit up.
Dot apples with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter. Sprinkle with 5 tablespoons
reserved apple liquid.

5. Roll out remaining dough; cut with knife or fluted pastry wheel
into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Weave strips into lattice over fruit. Seal

Sprinkle reserved crumbs in holes of lattice. Brush only crust edge
and strips with beaten egg.

6. Bake on foil-lined baking sheet at 450 degrees, 5 minutes. Reduce
oven temperature to 350 degrees; bake until apples are tender, 50 to
55 more minutes (or only 40 minutes if you like crunchier apples).
Cool on wire rack to room temperature.

vanilla sugar and orange-flavored liqueur.
