Categories: Breads, Desserts, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Loaf
4 oz Tofu
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Amaretto
14 fl Coconut milk
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Baking powder
1 c  Unsweetened coconut flakes
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease a 9" x 5" x 3" loaf pan.

Blend together tofu and sugar thoroughly in an electric mixer or by
mashing them together in a large mixing bowl with the utensil of your
choice. :-)

Mix Amaretto and coconut milk into tofu until well blended.

Meanwhile, sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Toss in
coconut flakes, then add dry ingredients to liquid mixture and blend
thoroughly.

Spoon batter into prepared loaf pan.  Bake until done, about 50
minutes. Cool slightly before removing from pan.

Toasted slices of this bread are very nice with tea, coffee, or your
fave hot beverage.

[Note: 1 teaspoon of almond extract and 1/4 cup of water may be
substituted for the 1/4 cup of Amaretto. 1 1/2 cups water plus 1/4
cup oil may be used instead of coconut milk.]
