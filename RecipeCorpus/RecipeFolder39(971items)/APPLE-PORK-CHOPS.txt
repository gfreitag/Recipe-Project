Title: APPLE PORK CHOPS
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
6    Pork chops
Pork chop fat or oil
2 ts Butter
-salt and pepper to taste
3    Apples-unpeeled with cores
1 ts Sugar

Cook the chops using melted fat trimmed from the meat and 1 tsp
butter. (Note from Anne MacLellan; those concerned about their fat
intake may chose to use corn oil or some other vegetable oil rather
than the pork fat). Season to taste and set on hot platter. Keep warm.
Slice the apples 1/2" thick and add to the pan with 1 tsp butter, the
sugar and a few pinches of cinnamon or cloves. Cook over medium heat
for about 10 minutes, turning once or twice until some of apples are
browned. Arrange them around the chops and serve. Serves: 4-6
