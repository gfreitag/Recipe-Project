Title: APPLE UP & DOWN CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Low-fat
Yield: 12 Servings
1 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Lightly packed brown sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
3 md Apples, peeled, cored sliced
3/4 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
1    Egg
1    Egg white
1/4 c  Oil
1/4 c  2% milk
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Dried currants or raisins
1 md Apple, cored and grated
My suggestion:  line a 9 x 9 inch cake pan or large deep dish pie
plate with wax paper.  Melt the butter in a small glass cup in the
microwave, stir in brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spread as evenly
as possible over the wax paper.  Original recipe used 10 inch skillet
with ovenproof handle. Arrange apple slices (or chunks) in butter
sauce.

Combine flour, baking powder and salt on a piece of wax paper or in a
mixing bowl.  In second bowl, beat together sugar, egg, egg white,
oil, milk and vanilla. Combine with dry ingredients until just
blended. Fold in currants (or raisins) and grated apple.  Leave the
skin on the apple for extra fiber if you are using a food processor
for the grating.

Pour into pan over apple layer.  Bake at 350 F for 25 to 30 minutes or
until cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Set
aside to let cool.

Carefully invert pan and remove cake to serving plate. Makes 12
servings.
