Title: APPLE & CARAMEL PUDDING
Categories: Lakeland, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
6 oz Self-Raising Flour
3 oz Suet
1/4 ts Salt
Cold Water to mix
4 oz Soft brown sugar
1 oz Butter
2 lg Cooking Apples
Butter the pudding basin thickly with the ounce of butter, then press
in 3 ounces of the sugar. Mix the flour, salt and suet together. Add
just enough cold water to make a soft. but not sticky dough. Do not
overwork or you will get tough pastry. Roll out two-thirds of the
pastry and line the buttery, sugary basin. Slice in the peeled and
cored apples. Sprinkle in the last ounce of sugar. Make a circle for
a lid with the last of the pastry. Moisten the edges to make a firm
seal, pinching the two layers of pastry together well. Trim any
surplus. Cover with a double layer of greaseproof and steam for two
hours. Turn out your pudding for service and a caramel sauce will be
coating the outside.
