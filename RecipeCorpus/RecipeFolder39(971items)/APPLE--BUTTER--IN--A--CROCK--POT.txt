Title: APPLE  BUTTER  IN  A  CROCK  POT
Categories: Sauces, Crock pot, Butters
Yield: 4 Servings
5 c  Apples (cooked and mashed)
5 c  Sugar
2 tb Vinegar
Boil applesauce on high heat, then add sugar and vinegar. I hold the
cinnamon until last 1/2 hour because I think it evaporates some. Cook
on high heat (about 4 hours) until the apple butter is as thick as
you want it when you cool and serve.
