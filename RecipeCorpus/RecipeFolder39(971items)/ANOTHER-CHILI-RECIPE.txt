Title: ANOTHER CHILI RECIPE
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  TVP, rehydrated
8    To 16 oz of tempeh, chopped
8    To 16 oz of tofu, crumbled
1    To 2 cans pinto beans,
Rinsed
1    To 2 cans kidney beans,
Rinsed
1    To 2 cans white beans,
Rinsed
x  Any other bean you like
2    To 4 large onions, chopped
10    Or more cloves garlic,
Chopped
2    To 4 green peppers, chopped
1    Or more hot peppers of your
Choice (jalepeno,
Serrano, ..), minced
2    To 4 15 oz cans crushed
Tomatoes
6    To 12 oz tomato paste
1/2    To 1 lb mushrooms, coursly
Chopped
1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
2 tb Chili powder
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Vinegar
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Allspice
1 tb Cumin
Saute the onion, peppers, hot peppers, and garlic until the onions are
translucent.  Add all other ingrediants and simmer a minimum of 30
minutes (about how long corn bread takes to cook ;-). Add water if
chili is too thick.  Adjust seasonings during cooking to taste.

That's it!  Last night's batch had TVP, 1 can pinto beans, 2 cans
kidney beans, 1 can black eye peas, so I used double the spices and
the higher amounts of the rest of the ingrediants. Very tasty last
night and of course even better today for lunch.
