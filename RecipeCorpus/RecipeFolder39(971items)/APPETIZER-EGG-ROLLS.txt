until lightly browned. Stir in the mushrooms, bean sprouts, currants,
and almonds and saute, stirring for 1 minute.  Dissolve the
cornstarch in 2 T water, and combine with sherry, soy sauce, and
ginger; add to the pork mixture and bring to a boil, stirring.
Remove from heat and cool.  Stack the egg roll wrappers and cut in
half to form rectangles. Forming one roll at a time, place a heaping
a teaspoonful of pork mixture on one end of rectangle, moisten the
long edges, and roll up.  Press the edges together to seal. Egg roll
may be prepared to this point, then refrigerated for several hours or
overnight or frozen for several days before frying. Adjust time for
browining. If rolls are frozen, let them thaw before cooking. Heat
the oil to 375 degrees F. and fry the egg rolls, 4 or 5 at a time,
until golden brown and crisp on all sides.  Frying will take about 4
to 5 minutes; turn rolls once. Drain on paper towels and keep warm
while frying the remaining rolls. Serve with warm Ginger Apricot
Sauce. GINGER APRICOT SAUCE: Combine the apricots, sugar, ginger, and
salt with 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer, uncoverd, for 5 minutes. Pour the mixture
into a blender container or food processor. Add lemon juice, cover
and process until smooth. Serve warm.
