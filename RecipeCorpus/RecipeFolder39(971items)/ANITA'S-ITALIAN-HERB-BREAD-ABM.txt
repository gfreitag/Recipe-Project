Title: ANITA'S ITALIAN HERB BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 tb Yeast
2 c  Flour, bread
1 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Basil leaves
1/4 ts Oregano leaves
3 tb Buttermilk, powdered
1 1/2 oz Cheese, Parmesan, grated
1 tb Oil
7/8 c  Water
Bring bread ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

For best results, use the finest and freshest ingredients available.
That is especially true for this particular recipe.
Lois' sister Anita, who loves Italian food, will tell you that this
fabulous bread is well worth the trip to your nearest Italian market
or deli to purchase a chunk of imported Parmesan.
You'll be disappointed with anything less, once you've tried it.
