Title: APPLE BUTTER/OVEN
Categories: Canning
Yield: 12 Servings
3    Unsweetened applesauce
2    Granulated sugar
1    Brown sugar
3/4    Apple cider
Spices:
1/2    Nutmeg
1/4    Allspice
3/4    Ground cloves
3    Cinnamon
The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier
texture that's best for applesauce. Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider
together and cook in a slow oven(325 deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring
occasionally. Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more. Apple
butter requires long, slow cooking. (Can also be made in a crockpot.)
