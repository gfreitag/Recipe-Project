Title: APPLE & FENNEL PANDOWDY
Categories: Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
5 lg Apples
1 1/2 c  Fennel bulb
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Apple cider
1 1/2 tb Sambuca (anise liqueur)
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1/4 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2 ts Sugar
12    Hazelnuts
1 3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 oz Cold shortening
3 oz Cold unsalted butter
4 tb Ice water
Peel and core apples and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Dice fennel. Toast
and peel hazelnuts. Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces.

Combine  apples, fennel, lemon juice, honey, cider, sambuca, nutmeg,
allspice and salt in a bowl; toss gently to combine. Cover and set
aside.

Topping: Combine sugar, nuts, flour and salt in a processor. Pulse
until nuts are finely ground. Add shortening and butter and pulse
until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a
time, pulsing briefly after each addition.  Continue adding water
until mixture holds together when pinched between your fingers. Do
not overmix or the dough will be tough. Pat into a disc, wrap in
plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Spoon the apple mixture into a 9 x 13-inch glass baking dish. Roll
out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 9 x 13-inch
rectangle; gently lay the dough over the fruit, tucking in the edges.
Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and, using a spoon or
spatula, break crust into 3- or 4-inch irregular squares. Press
pieces into the apples, "dowdying" the appearance of the dish. Return
to oven and bake for 20 minutes, until well browned. Let cool 15
minutes before serving.
