Serving
Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water for 4 to 6 minutes, or until
just tender.   Drain the pasta and toss it with 1 tablespoon of the
oil to keep it from sticking together, then keep it warm. Heat the
remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet. Add the garlic and
saute it lightly; do not brown. Add the broccoli flowerets and
peppers, and saute over medium heatuntil tender, about 5 to 7
minutes.  Remove the vegetables from the skillet. Add the cream to
the pan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until it
starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and
nutmeg, and cook an additional 2 minutes to thicken it a bit more.
Add vegetables and the cooked pasta. Toss them together well. Season
with salt and pepper if needed.  Serve immediately, with additional
Parmesan on the side.
