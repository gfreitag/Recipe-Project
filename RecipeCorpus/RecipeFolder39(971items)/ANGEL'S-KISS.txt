Title: ANGEL'S KISS
Categories: Mixed, Drinks, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 oz Dark creme de cacao
1/4 oz Creme Yvette
1/4 oz Brandy
1/4 oz Sweet cream
Pour ingredients slowly, in order given, into a pony or pousse-cafe
glass, being careful not to let ingredients mix. This produces a
multi-colored "striped" effect of the liquors.For best results pour
each ingredient slowly over a teaspoon held bottom-side up over the
glass. You can achieve the same effect by inserting a glass stirring
rod into the glass and then slowly pouring each ingredient down the
rod.
