1 c  Cake Flour;sifted
1 1/4 c  Sugar; granulated/sifted
1 c  Egg whites
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Cream of tartar
3/4 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Almond extract
Sift flour once, measure, add 1/4 cup sugar, and sift together four
times. Beat egg whites and salt with rotary egg beater or flat wire
whisk. When foamy, add cream of tartar and continue beating until
eggs are stiff enough to hold up in peaks, but not dry. Add remaining
I cup sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating with rotary egg beater
or whisk after each addition until sugar is just blended. Fold in
flavoring. Then sift about 1/4 cup flour over mixture and fold in
lightly; repeat until all is used. Turn into ungreased angel food
pan. Cut gently through batter with knife to remove air bubbles. Bake
in slow oven (325 degrees F) 45 to 50 minutes Remove from oven and
invert pan 1 hour, or until cold. Spread Raspberry Icing thinly on
top and sides of cake. Angel Food Cake is often served plain or
sprinkled lightly with confectioners'sugar. For Large Angel Food
Cake, use above recipe, increasing sugar and egg whites to 1 1/2 cups
each. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar to flour and 1 1/4 cups to egg whites.
Bake in slow oven (325 degrees F) 1 hour. Note: Remove eggs from
refrigerator several hours be- fore using. They beat up lighter and
more easily when at room temperature, and give increased fineness of
grain and delicacy of texture to angel food cakes. Kate Smith
