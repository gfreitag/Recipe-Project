Categories: Diabetic, Nuts, Fruits, Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
1/3 c  Dried apple rings;
1/4 c  Heaped bulgur;
2/3 c  Cup natural yogurt
-=OR=-
2/3 c  Fromage frais;
1/4 c  Milk;
A little artifical sweetener
-(optional)
Mix the apple and bulgur in a bowl, then stir in the yogurt or formage
frais and half the milk.  Cover and set aside for 30 minutes, or
until the bulgur is softened and swollen. The grain should stillhave
some bite, although it can be left covered in the refrigerator
overnight. Stir well and add extra milk necessary to make the mixture
creamy. The mixture can be sweetened with artificial sweetener if
liked.

Very the fruit, if you like, or add fresh fruit to the plain soaked
bulgar.
