Have your fish dealer prepare the squid (skin, remove the long bone
on the inside, the yellow deposit, and the ink sac). Wash the squid
well, dry thoroughly, and cut crosswise into 1/4" slices resembling
rings. Poach in white wine to cover just until tender. Drain. Cool to
room temperature.

Thoroughly wash and scrub the mussels, removing grit and sand. Place
the mussels in a large pot. Pour in 1/2 cup boiling water, cover and
steam over medium heat for 5 minutes or until the shells open. They
should be cooked and served the same day you buy them.

Arrange an assortment of the seafood attractively on 8 plates.
Garnish with lemon wedges. Whisk together the oil and lemon juice,
and drizzle the mixture over the seafood. Using a whisk, combine the
mayonnaise, catsup, brandy, and Worchestershire sauce. Serve a dollop
of this sauce on each plate.

Venetian cooking allows the delicate flavor of the seafood full rein.
This antipasto is actually a filling first course.
