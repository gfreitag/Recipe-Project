Title: AM KA MURABBA (GREEN MANGO PRESERVE)
Categories: Jam/jelly, Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Mangoes
1 1/4 pt Water
2 oz Almonds; toasted/blanched
1 ts Citric acid
6 dr Kewra essence OR 1 tb ruh
-kewra
3 lb Sugar
8    Green cardamom; seeds only
Wash, peel, cut the mangoes into large slices and prick all over with
a fork. Or cut them into fancy shapes and do not prick. Tie the slices
loosely in a piece of muslin, and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes in 1
1/4    pint of boiling water.

Remove and dry them on a piece of cloth. Add sugar and citric acid to
the water in which mango slices were boiled. Cook to one-thread
consistency (remove the scum from the surface of the syrup). Add
mango slices, simmer till the syrup thickens and the slices become
tender and slightly translucent. Leave for 12 hours.

Remove the slices from the syrup if they are sufficiently tender. Tie
the crushed cardamom seeds in a piece of muslin and add this to the
syrup. Boil till it again acquires one-thread consistency.

Remove the muslin containing the cardamom seeds, squeeze out the
juice and discard the seeds. Add mango slices and peeled halves of
blanced almonds and cook for a few minutes more. Remove from the heat
and cool.

Add ruh kewra or essence and pour into hot clean glass jars,
previously cleaned with boiling hot water. Fill just short of
overflowing, put a disc of 2 to 3 layers of greaseproof or waxed
paper over the mouth of the jar and cover with a screw-cap.
