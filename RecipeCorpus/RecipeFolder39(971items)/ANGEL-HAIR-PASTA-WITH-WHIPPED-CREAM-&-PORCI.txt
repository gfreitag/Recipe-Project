Title: ANGEL HAIR PASTA WITH WHIPPED CREAM & PORCI
Categories: Pasta, Dairy, Mushrooms
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms *
3 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Chopped shallots
3/4 lb Fresh mushrooms, chopped
1/2 pt (1 cup) whipping cream
3/4 c  Angel hair pasta
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
pn Salt and pepper to taste
Place the porcini in a small bowl and and 1/2 cup warm water. Allow
to soak 45 minutes.  Drain, reserving the liquid. Heat a large frying
pan. Add the oil and shallots, and saute a minute. Add the fresh
mushrooms and saute until tender.  Chop the porcini coarsely and add
to the frying pan, along with the reserved liquid. Simmer until most
of the liquid is evaporated.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil along with a pinch of salt. In a
separate bowl, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Refrigerate
the whipped cream until the pasta is cooked. Cook the pasta in the
boiling water until al dente.  Drain well, return the drained pasta
to the pot and add the mushroom mixture, cheese, whipped cream and
salt and pepper to taste.

Using a large spatula, fold all of the ingredients together. Do this
quickly, yet carefully, so that the whipped cream doesn't collapse
entirely.  You may want to save a bit of the whipped cream to dollop
on top of the pasta as a garnish.

Serve immediately.
