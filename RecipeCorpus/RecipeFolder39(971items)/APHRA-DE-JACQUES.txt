Title: APHRA DE JACQUES
Categories: Garlic, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 lb Monterey Jack cheese
30    Cloves fresh garlic
4 c  Peanut oil
1 tb Italian seasoning
3    Eggs beaten
2 c  All-purpose flour
3 c  French bread crumbs
3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 sm Jar Marinara Sauce
Slice cheese into 30 slices about 1/4 inch thick. Peel garlic and
slice each clove lengthwise into about 6 ovals. Heat oil in deep,
heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic ovals and simmer 5 to
7 minutes, being careful not to burn or brown cloves. Remove slices
as they float to the surface and are light brown in color. Drain on
paper towel. Reserve oil for cheese.  Mince garlic and mix with
Italian seasoning. Spread half the cheese slices evenly with garlic
mixture. Press remaining cheese slices on each of make 15 bars. Dip
flour-coated pieces into egg again, then into bread crumbs mixed with
parsley.  Be sure to cover sides.
Reheat oil to medium-high and fry cheese in oil a few pieces at a
time until lightly browned (takes about 2 minutes). Skim particles
from oil as they accumulate. Drain cheese on paper towels and keep
warm until all are fried.  Serve with toothpicks and Marinara Sauce
for dipping. Makes about 30 pieces.
