3 c  Apple cider
2    Envelopes unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Sugar
6 oz Frozen lemonade concentrate
2 lg Apples, skinned and diced
1/4 c  Chopped celery
1/4 c  Slivered almonds
Whipped cream for topping
Mix 1 cup cider with gelatin in small pan. Let stand for few minutes.
Add sugar and cook; stir until dissolved, remove from heat. Core and
dice apples and mix with thawed lemonade concentrate to prevent any
darkening. Lift out apples with slotted spoon and reserve. Stir
lemonade and remaining cider into gelatin mixture. Regrigerate until
thick and syrupy, then add apples and celery. Place almonds or other
chopped nuts in bottom of 6 cup mold. Spoon gelatin over nuts, cover
and chill firm. Dip mold to the rim in hot water for 5 seconds to
invert onto serving plate. Surround with lettuce leaves and serve
with whipped cream. Sour cream goes good with this too.
