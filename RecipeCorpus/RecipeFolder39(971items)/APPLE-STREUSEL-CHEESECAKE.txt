Title: APPLE STREUSEL CHEESECAKE
Categories: Kooknet, Cyberealm, Cheesecake, Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 1 Cheesecake    I make this cheesecake often, especially in the fall. I don't use
special recipe, just make a plain, New York type cheesecake, but add
apple pie spices like cinnamon and nutmeg (to taste). Then add diced
fresh apples to taste (couple of cups usually). Then top the whole
thing with a streusel topping (butter, sugar and a little flour all
cut up together) like you would put on a Dutch Apple Pie and bake as
the directions for the plain cheesecake suggest.
It is wonderful.
