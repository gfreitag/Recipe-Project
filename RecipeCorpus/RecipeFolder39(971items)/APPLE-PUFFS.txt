Title: APPLE PUFFS
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 c  Aunt Jemima (Orig) pancake m
3/4 c  Skim milk
2 tb Vegetable oil*
1 ea Jar chunky apple sauce
1 ea Large egg
8 ea Large ripe strawberries
1 x  Powdered sugar
1 x  Cinnamon
Mix the  pancake mix, milk, egg and oil in a 2 cup measure. OK to
have a little rough mixture. Make the mixture a little thinner than
regular batter but thicker than for a crepe.
Heat an 8" shallow Teflon (sloped sided) pan with a drop of oil on
medium heat. Pour in 1/4 of the batter (enough to make a thin
pancake. Allow the dough to cook until the bubbles form on top but
the pk is not cooked all the way through. The bottom should be a
light golden brown. Scoop 3 Tbs of apple sauce on one half of the
pancake. Quickly fold the other half over so it puffs up. Cook for
about a minute or so (being careful not to burn). Turn over briefly
to cook other side and warm the apples.
Serve each on a large platter and top with cinnamon and sliced
strawberries Finish with a little powdered sugar.
I think what happened was that the applesauce mixed with the still
uncooked pancake top and was cooked (combined) to make an unusual
fluffy inside. * Use one Tb of oil to cut fat. ...George
