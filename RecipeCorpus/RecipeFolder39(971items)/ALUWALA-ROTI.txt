Cover with a damp cloth for 20 minutes. Boil potatoes, peel and mash.
Add salt, onion, pepper and coriander. Mix well. Divide into 8
portions. Knead dough well until smooth and pliable. Divide into 6
round balls. Flatten each ball slightly. Put one portion of filling
in centre. Close up completely. Shape into round balls again. Roll
out each ball on a lightly floured board into a round disk 6" (15 cm)
diameter. Cook one at a time on a hot griddle over medium heat. Put
about 1 or 2 tbsp ghee around the edge. Turn gently. Cook until sides
turn golden brown in colour. Serve with yogurt. Vegetarian Kheema
Roti: Instead of potato stuffing, used cooked and seasoned vegetarian
minced meat (Anne's note: the preface lists "nutri nuggets"; I
suspect that this is an Indian brand of TVP) for stuffing.
