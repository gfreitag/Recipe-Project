Title: APPLE CRUNCH COBBLER
Categories: Lowfat, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Instant oat meal
1 c  Whole wheat flour
3/4 cn Frozen apple juice
Concentrate, thawed
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1    Golden delicious apple
1    Egg replacer
1/4 ts Baking powder
makes 1 8-9" pan full

Cut the apple into bite sized pieces.  Mix together everything except
the apples.  Put a thin layer (1/8-1/4") of mixture on the bottom of a
non-stick or Pammed round pan. Put apples on top of this. Then spread,
plop, drop or get the rest of the mix on top of the apples *some
way*. Then bake at 350F. I baked it for 25 minutes but it made the
apples really mushy so next time I'll probably only bake it for 15-17
minutes.

I thought this turned out really good.  My husband even liked it and
he thinks that there isn't anyway that a fatfree dessert can taste
good. :-) Date:
