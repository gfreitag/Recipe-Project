Title: ANOTHER IRISH SODA BREAD RECIPE <T>
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
6 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
3/4 c  Sugar
1 lb Raisins
3 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ea Caraway seeds to taste
(usually 1/8 cup
1 qt Buttermilk
Mix all the dry ingredients in a LARGE bowl. Mix in caraway and
rasins. Mix in buttermilk. It helps to use your hands to mix this
because the dough is stickey DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC MIXER. I did this
a couple of times and the bread came out very flat. Divide batter
into two buttered cake pans. Flour a knife and cut a cross into the
tops of each. Bake at 350 for about an hour. The top should not be
allowed to get to brown.

in Ireland.
