Title: APPLE PANCAKES (SMITH)
Categories: Breakfast, Fruits
Yield: 2 Servings
1 1/2 c  Whole-grain wheat pastry flo
3/4 c  Bran
3 tb Applesauce
2 ts Active dry yeast
3/4 c  Water; warm
2 ts Egg substitute, dried; mixed
4 tb Water
1 1/2 c  Apple juice
2 md Apple; peeled and grated
Recipe by: McDougall Mix flour and bran. Add applesauce and mix well.
Add yeast to warm water, stir to dissolve. Let rest 5 minutes while
grating the apple. Add the apple juice, grated apple, and yeast
mixture to the flour mixture. Stir batter well. Mix the egg replacer
with water, beat until frothy. Add to batter. Cover batter and let
rest for 15 minutes. Cook on medium-hot non-stick griddle, about 10
minutes on first side, about 5-8 minutes on other side.

HELPFUL HINTS: Ladle the batter on the griddle and flatten cakes, or
the center won't be done. Do not turn until bubbles form on top.
These are much thicker than regular pancakes and take longer to cook.
