*DIRECTIONS* Melt stick of butter and lightly brown the bread crumbs.
Set aside to cool. Sprinkle the cooled bread crumbs over the
stretched dough. Spread the sliced apples evenly over the dough and
sprinkle sugar, cinnamon and lemon rind over the apples. Melt the 1/2
stick of butter and when it has cooled spoon over the apples. Roll up
dough. Place in well greased pan and bake in 350 F oven for one hour.

notes: Be careful not to puncture the dough when transferring to the
pan, otherwise the strudel will stick to the pan.

*VARIATIONS* Instead of lemon rind Grandma uses lemon juice. Grandma
also waits until the dough is ready to slice the apples, that way
they don't turn brown. She also uses the slicer on the side of a
grater to slice the apples really thin.
