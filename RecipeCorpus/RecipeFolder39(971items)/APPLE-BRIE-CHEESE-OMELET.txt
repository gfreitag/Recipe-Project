Title: APPLE-BRIE CHEESE OMELET
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Apples; peeled, cored &
-thinly sliced
8 tb Butter
8    Eggs
8 ts Cream
Salt & pepper
2 tb Butter
8 tb Diced Brie cheese
Saute apple in butter. Beat together eggs, cream, and salt & pepper
until blended but not frothy.  Melt butter in omelette pan over high
heat until foam begins to recede but before beginning to color. Pour
in egg mixture and prepare omelette, beating to lighten but still
allowing it to set on the bottom.

Fill with sauteed apples and diced Brie cheese cubes. Fold or roll and
slide out of pan onto a heated plate.

Gail's Notes: YUM!  Good luck trying to "dice" Brie, tho! <ggg>
