Categories: Medieval, Fruit
Yield: 6 Servings  Rapey.  Take half fyges and half raisouns; pike hem and waishe hem in
water.  Skalde hem in wyne, bray hem in a morter, and drawe them
thurgh a straynour.  Cast hem in a pot and therwith powdur of peper
and oother good powdours; alay it vp with flour of rys, and colour it
with saundres. Salt it, seeth it & messe it forth.

125 g/4 oz well-soaked dried figs
125    g/4 oz stoned raisins 275 ml/10 fl oz/1 1/4 cups red wine
(not too dry) Good pinch of ground black pepper
1/3    teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8    teaspoon ground cloves Soft dark brown sugar to taste 3
teaspoons rice flour or cornflour A drop or two of red food colouring
Salt to taste

Drain the figs, reserving the soaking liquid.  Discard the stalk ends
of the fruit and put them in a saucepan with the raisins and wine.
Add the spices and a teaspoon of sugar and bring to the boil. Take
off the heat and cool slightly, then turn the mixture into an
electric blender and process until smooth.  Add a little of the
soaking water if the mixture is stubbornly solid.

Cream the rice flour or cornflour with a little more soaking water or
wine and brighten the tint with a drop of food colouring. Blend the
'cream' into the dried-fruit puree. Then return the whole mixture to
the saucepan and simmer until it thickens slightly. Season with salt
and a little extra sugar if you wish.

The mixture can be served hot or cold over a sweet cereal dish, firm
stewed fruit or - best of all- ice cream. Some versions in other
manuscripts are stiffer and make a good filling for tartlets or fried
puffs. One encloses the filling in pastry to make dumplings.
