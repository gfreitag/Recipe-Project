* demerara: a brown sugar, but each grain is kind of separate. If you
have a Carribean store in your neighbourhood, their brown sugar is
what you want. But you can substitute light brown sugar for it.

Muscvada: Very dark brown sugar (almost black), sticks together in one
solid lump and has to be prised apart. The rawest (and tastiest) of
all the sugars. Really good for dark cakes and especially Christmas
puddings.

Brown crystal. Very large variagated brown crystals of sugar, hard and
crunchy usually used in coffee.
