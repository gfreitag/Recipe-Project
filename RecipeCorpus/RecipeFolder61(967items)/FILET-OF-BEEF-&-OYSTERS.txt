Title: FILET OF BEEF & OYSTERS
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Filet mignon steaks
2 tb Butter or olive oil
1 qt Oysters, reserve liquid --
Shucked
2/3 c  White wine to deglace
2    Garlic cloves -- thinly
Sliced
1    Juiced lemon
1 tb Chopped parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
Pan fry the filets in the butter or olive oil until rare or medium
rare over medium to med. high heat. For me, about two minutes per
side is fine. Use a non-stick pan. Remove the filets to a serving
plate, reserving the pan drippings in the frying pan.

Deglace the pan with the white wine. Add the thinly sliced garlic and
the lemon juice. Add the oysters and the oyster liquid and simmer for
approx. 6 - 8 minutes until the oysters are just cooked; until the
edges of the oysters are just beginning to curl. Do not over-cook!

Carefully remove, with a slotted spoon, the oysters and arrange
around and over the filet, reserving the liquid in the pan.

Put the remaining liquid back on the stove-top, over med/high heat and
reduce to half. The sauce will slightly thicken. At the last minute
add the chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Be very careful with the
salt as the oysters and liquid have a salty flavor.

Pour the sauce over the filets and oysters, garnish with parsley and
serve. Sounds weird but WOW!!! it's good.
