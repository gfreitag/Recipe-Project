Title: FLAVORED OLIVE OILS
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
Olive oil
Fresh rosemary sprigs
Fresh thyme sprigs
Crushed red chili flakes
Granulated garlic
Italian seasoning
Dried basil
I make my flavored oils by putting fresh sprigs of rosemary and thyme
in the bottle. I also put a little crushed red chili flakes, some
dried granulated garlic, Italian seasoning, dried basil and anything
else you like.   As you use the oil, you can keep adding more oil
until the herbs look scuzzy.
