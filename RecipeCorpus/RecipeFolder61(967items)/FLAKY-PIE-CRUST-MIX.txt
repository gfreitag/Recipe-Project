Combine unbleached flour and salt in a large bowl and blend well.
With a pastry blender, cut in shortening until evenly distributed.
Mixture will resemble cornmeal in texture. Put in a large airtight
container and lable as Flaky Pie Crust Mix.  Store in a cool, dry
place and use within 10 to 12 weeks.  Or put about 2 1/2 cups of
mixture each into 6 freezer bags. Seal and label bags and freeze.
Use within 12 months.

Makes about 16 cups mix, enough for 6 double pie crusts or 12 single
pie crusts. FLAKY PIE CRUST:

Crumble Flaky Pie Crust Mix, if frozen.  Put mix in a medium bowl. In
a small bowl, combine ice water, egg and vinegar. Sprinkle a spoonful
of the water mixture at a time over the flaky pie crust mix and toss
with a fork until dough barely clings together in the bowl. Roll out
dough to desired thickness between 2 sheets of lightly floured
waxpaper. Place dough in 9-inch pie plate without stretching. Flute
edges. If filling recipe calls for a baked picrust, preheat oven to
425 degrees F. (220 degrees C.). Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until very
lightly browned. Cool. Fill and bake according to directions for
filling.  For double crust pie, place top crust over filling, press
and flute edges, and cut slits in top crust. Makes enough crust for
one 9-inch double-crust pie or two single-crust pies.
