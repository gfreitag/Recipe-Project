Title: FOCOCCIA BREAD/PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
2 pk Fast-rising dry yeast
2 c  Tepid water (90 degrees)
2 tb Sugar
4 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Salad oil
1 ts Table salt
5 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
3 cl Garlic
Dissolve the yeast in the tepid water.  Add sugar, olive oil, salad
oil, and regular salt.  Mix 3 cups of the flour and whip until the
dough begins to leave the sides of the mixing bowl, about 10 minutes.

Mix in remaining flour by hand or with a dough hook and knead the
dough until it is smooth.  Allow the dough to rise twice, right in
the bowl, and punch down after each rising.

Either freeze at this point or roll out into two pizza rounds. Put on
pizza tray and rub with garlic.  Add toppings and bake at 450 degrees
for 10-15 minutes. Check to see when done.
