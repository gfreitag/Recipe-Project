Categories: Sauces, Desserts, Weird
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Butter
2 c  Seedless green grapes
- split in halves
2    Hot chiles; minced
-habaneros, jalapenos or
-serranos
3 tb Rum
1 tb Honey
1/4 ts Vanilla
1 ds Ground nutmeg
1 ds Ground cinnamon
Melt butter in small omelet pan.  Add grapes and saute 3 minutes. Add
minced chiles and rum.  Saute l more minute, then flambe by carefully
tilting pan into gas flame until pan flames up or by holding match
over evaporating alcohol. When flames subside, add honey, vanilla,
nutmeg and cinnamon.  Cook 3 minutes more, stirring frequently. Makes
about l l/3 cups, 4 servings. From the article in the LA Times,
issued 6/28/92, comes this comment on this recipe: "Chef Frank Khachi
concocted grape-habanero topping to serve over a handmade pineapple
parfait, but it's great served over plain ice creams such as
chocolate, vanilla or strawberry. Add the sauce to the ice cream just
before serving. Chiles vary widely in their level of heat, but they
become milder as they are cooked. If you're cooking for total
sissies, try this with only one pepper. If you already have a serious
pepper habit, better increase the dosage to three or four".
