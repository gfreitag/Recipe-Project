Categories: Chinese, Seafood

1/4 lb White fish filets (such as

2 ts Minced green onions
1 ts Soy sauce
1/4 ts Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salad oil
1/4 ts Sesame oil
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 ts Sugar
1/8 ts Liquid hot pepper seasoning
1 ds Pepper
1 pk Tofu (about 22 oz)
Salad oil
3    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2    Head iceberg lettuce, cut in
-2 inch squares
1/4 c  Frozen peas, thawed
4 oz Whole mushrooms
1 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Cornstarch
2 ts Soy sauce
1 tb Water
Finely chop fish.  Mix with green onion, soy sauce, cornstarch, salad
oil, sesame oil, salt, sugar, hot pepper seasoning and pepper, set
aside. Cut tofu block crosswise in four equal slices, then cut each
slice in half diagonally.  Place in a colander and let drain for 15
minutes, then place between paper towels and gently press out excess
water. Change paper towels several times until they no longer soak up
any moisture. On widest side of each triangle, cut a pocket to within
1/2 inch of edges. Gently stuff each pocket with about 1 1/2 t fish
filling.  In a wok or deep pan, pour oil to a depth of about 1 1/2
inches and heat to 350 degrees. Add several bean curd triangles at a
time and fry, turning once, until golden on all sides (about 4 to 5
minutes).  Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Cool, cover,
and chill, if made ahead. In wide frying pan, heat 1 T salad oil over
medium-high heat.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, just until it
begins to brown.  Add lettuce, then stir and cook just until lettuce
begins to wilt (about one minute). Stir in peas and mushrooms; top
with stuffed tofu. Pour broth over tofu, cover, and simmer over low
heat for 8 minutes (15 minutes if chilled). Stir together cornstarch,
soy and water. Push tofu away from one side of pan and stir soy
mixture into broth; cook, stirring carefully so as not to break the
tofu, until sauce bubbles and thickens.
