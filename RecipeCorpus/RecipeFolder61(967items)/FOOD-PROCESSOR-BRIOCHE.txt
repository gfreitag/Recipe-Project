Title: FOOD PROCESSOR BRIOCHE
Categories: Breads
Yield: 10 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (105F-to-115F)
2 1/3 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Butter
- cool but not hard-chilled
3    Eggs
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1    Egg yolk; beaten, mixed with
2 tb Water
GREASE AND FLOUR 10 small fluted 1/3-cup brioche tins. Or use 1 3-cup
brioche pan. Dissolve yeast and a pinch of sugar in warm water. In
food processor or mixer, add flour and the rest of the sugar. Beat in
the cool butter. Add yeast and water; beat in the 3 eggs, 1 at a
time. Beat until shiny and glossy, and the dough forms long slick
strings with an adhesive quality. If the food processor turns off,
the dough is ready. Place it in an oiled plastic bag or oiled bowl;
turn to coat. Seal or cover. Let rise in a warm place until tripled.
Punch down and let rise again covered, in the refrigerator for 6
hours or overnight. Take 2/3 of the now-spongy dough and, working
quickly, form into balls. Put balls in tins. Cut a deep cross in the
center of each ball. With remaining dough, form small pear-shaped
knobs. Fit the pointed ends of the knobs into the center of each
cross, pressing firmly in place. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm place
until the dough doubles.

PREHEAT OVEN to 375F. Brush dough with egg glaze. Bake 20 minutes, or
until browned. For a quick brioche, cover dough in the greased bowl
with plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Grease
brioche forms or muffin tins. When dough is chilled, knead it with
floured hands. It should not require any more flour. Shape. Brush all
over with glaze. Let double 15 to 20 minutes, and bake in a 400F
oven, about 10 minutes or until brown.
