This version of the popular Italian flat bread gets a head start from
thawed frozen bread dough.  It takes 25 minutes to prepare and bakes
in 8 minutes. Cut dough into 6 equal pieces. On a lightly floured
board, roll each piece into 5-to-6 inch circle. Lightly spray three
12 by 15 inch baking sheet with cooking spray. Place 2 circles of
dough far apart on each sheet. Brush circles with olive oil. Sprinkle
with topping. Lightly cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm
place until dough rises and appears puffy, about 20 minutes. Preheat
oven to 475 degrees. Bake until puffed and golden. 8 to 10 minutes.
Serve warm. Best eaten same day; freeze for longer storage.
