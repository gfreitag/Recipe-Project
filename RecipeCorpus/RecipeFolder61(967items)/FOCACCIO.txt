Categories: Breads, Barry
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb White Unbleached Plain Flour
4 tb Olive Oil
1 ts Salt
1/2 pt Warm Water
1/2    Dry yeast Sachet
pn Sugar
Rosemary or Sage
Mash the yeast with a little of the water until it looks like mud.
Add the sugar and leave for 10 minutes until frothy.

Put the rest of the water, the flour, a little of the salt and the
olive oil into a large bowl. When the yeast is frothy, add that too.
Knead thoroughly for about 5 minutes. cover with a clean, damp tea
towel or cling film and leave it in the bowl in a warm place for
about 30 minutes. It will double in size.

Take the dough out, put on a board, cut it in half and spread so you
have two dinner plate-sized pieces. Sprinkle the rest of the salt
over the top, then add the rosemary or sage leaves, patting them into
the dough.

Put the loaves into a hot oven, gas mark 7, 400F, 200C for about 20
minutes.

The bread will only rise marginally and will have a lovely pale
golden top.
