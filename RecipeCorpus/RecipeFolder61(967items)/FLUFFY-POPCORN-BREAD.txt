Title: FLUFFY POPCORN BREAD
Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/2 c  Water
2 1/2 tb Butter
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 tb Vital gluten
1 c  Milled popped popcorn
3 c  Bread flour
2 ts Yeast
Pop popcorn. 1/2 cup popcorn yields 8 cups. Mill the popped popcorn.
8 cups of popped popcorn will yield 4 cups of fluffy popcorn flour.
Put ingredients in breadpan in order given. Set for rapid bake. The
resulting loaf is high and light--the texture almost of "Wonder
Bread" but much more flavorful. I milled the popcorn in my electic
Miracle Mill but the hand mills should work fine,too. Popcorn must be
compressed a bit as it's entering the mill and a wooden lemon reamer
works well as a "stuffer". Do NOT attempt to mill unpopped popcorn in
your electric mill. I can only break those hard kernels with my Back
to Basics hand mill. The extra popcorn flour can be frozen in a
ziploc and stored for future loaves. The fragrance is wonderful!
