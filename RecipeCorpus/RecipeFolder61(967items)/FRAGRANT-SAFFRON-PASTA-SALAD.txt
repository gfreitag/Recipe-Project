minutes less than the pack instructions. Rinse well with cold water
and drain thoroughly. Transfer to a serving bowl. 2. Heat the oil in
a small saucepan and add the saffron, flaked almonds, currants and
garlic. Cook gently, stirring, until the almonds turn a rich nutty
brown. Remove from the heat and blend in the lime juice, honey, cumin
and coriander. 3. Gently fold the pasta, pepper slivers and fresh
herbs into the dressing until lightly coated. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. 4. Refrigerate for 1 hour and then serve the salad,
garnished with sprigs of fresh coriander.

Preparation and cooking time: 30 minutes + 1 hour chilling

Freezing not recommended Use the smallest pasta shapes (pastini) you
can find for this spicy salad. Italian food shops may stock orzo
(barley) pasta which resemble grains of rice. This beautifully
fragrant and colourful salad is a good accompaniment to barbecued
chicken or lamb.
