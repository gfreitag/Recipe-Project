combine the suet, ham, bread crumbs, parsley, lemon peel, thyme,
sage, salt and a few grindings of pepper. Stir thoroughly, then add
the egg and mix together until the forcemeat can be gathered into a
ball. Divide into 12 equal pieces and with lightly moistened hands,
shape each piece into a ball about 1 1/2 in in diameter.
