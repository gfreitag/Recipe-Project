-directions
1/3 c  Sliced almonds

1.  Adjust oven rack to middle position.  Heat oven to 325 degrees.
Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter or margarine.

2.  Reserve 1 egg white for later use.  Beat 2 eggs yolks and 1 egg
white in a medium bowl.  Add cheese and rosemary; stir to combine and
set aside.

3.  Roll thawed dough on a lightly floured work surface into a
rectangle about 6 ny 20 inches.  Place cheese mixture lengthwise on
center of dough. Fold the dough over the filling and pinch to seal
seam. Place roll seam-side down around the outside of the prepared
springform pan to make a ring; pinch ends to seal. Brush with sliced
almonds.

4.  Bake for 1 hour.  Release pan hinge and remove bread immediately,
allow bread to rest 15 minutes on a wire rack before serving. Slice
apples and place them in a bowl of cold water that has been mixed
with 1 tablespoon lemon juice.

5.  Place cheese-filled bread in center of large round platter. Brain
apples and pat dry.  Arrange overlapping in small groupings around the
bread. Garnish with sprigs of fresh rosemary, if desired. Serve with
chutney, if desired.  Cut bread into wedges.

Advance preparation:  Assemble and freeze, unbaked. Thaw 6 hours in
the refrigerator.  Increase baking time by 5 minutes.

Note:  Cheese will shred more easily in the food processor if it is
very cold.  Place it in the freezer for 10 minutes before grating.
