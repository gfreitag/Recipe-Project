*    Use fresh or frozen Haddock or other fish fillets in this
recipe. Cut ancho chiles open, discard stems and seeds. Cut the
chiles into small pieces with a pair of scissors or a sharp knife.
Place in a small bowl and cover with boiling water; set aside for 45
to 60 minutes to soak. Drain. Meanwhile, thaw fish if frozen. Lightly
brown the fish fillets on both sides in hot oil. Arrange fish in a 13
X 9 X 2-inch baking dish. Season with a little salt.  In a blender
container, combine drained ancho chiles (or crushed red peppers) with
the UNDRAINED tomatoes, orange juice, onions, garlic, salt, oregano,
cumin, cinnamon, and cloves. Cover and blend until smooth.  In the
skillet used for cooking the fish, simmer the tomato mixture for
about 20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Pour
over the fish in the baking dish. Bake, uncovered, in a preheated 350
degree F. oven for 30 minutes.  Transfer the fish fillets to a
serving platter.  Top with lettuce, garnish with orange slices and
radish roses.
