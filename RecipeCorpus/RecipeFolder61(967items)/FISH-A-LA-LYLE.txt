Title: FISH A LA LYLE
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Eggs
Splash of milk
1 pk Golden Dipt Breading Mix
4 c  Bread crumbs
Garlic powder, salt and
-pepper to taste
Vegetable oil to fry
4    Fillets of fish (perch,
-walleye pike, etc)
"Here's my quick and dirty recipe to cook fresh fillets...

Soak your fish in a pan of milk first, overnight if you have time.

Mix the eggs in a bowl with just a splash of milk. Mix in equal
portions Golden Dipt Fish Style breading and 4 cups of bread crumbs.
Note -- do NOT read the Golden Dipt box, mix it dry with the bread
crumbs.

Add garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. For older men (Pat) use
more garlic powder... this really does help (g).

Put about 3/4 inch of oil in a frying pan and heat for about 10
minutes on medium/high or until water sizzles when splashed in the
grease (carefully).

Take your fillets from the pan of milk and dip it in the egg/milk
mixture. Then take it from there to the dry batter and make sure that
the entire fillet gets a good coating. Place it in the pan of hot oil
until golden brown. After you have repeated the process for all of
the fillets, eat your heart out!!"
