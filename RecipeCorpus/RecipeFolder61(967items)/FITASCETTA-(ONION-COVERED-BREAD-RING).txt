Title: FITASCETTA (ONION COVERED BREAD RING)
Categories: Main dish, Italian, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Large ring
3/4 ts Dried yeast
1 c  Warm water
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 1/2 c  All-purpose white flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 lb Red onions, sliced very fine
4 tb Margarine
Salt & pepper
1 pn Sugar
Olive oil
Stir the yeast into the water in a large mixing bowl & let stand
until it is creamy, about 10 minutes.  With a wooden spoon, stir in
the olive oil followed by the flour & salt. Knead by hand until moist
& velvety. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover & let rise
until doubled. Meanwhile, saute the onions in margarine over the
lowest possible heat until they are soft & transparent, about 40
minutes.  Season with salt & pepper & sugar. Leave to cool. When the
dough has risen, turn out onto a floured board & shape into a long
log. Transfer to a greased baking sheet & join the two ends to make a
ring of 6" tp 8" diameter. Keep the hole in the centre as open as
possible. Cover & let rise till doubled. 30 minutes before baking,
preheat oven to 400F.  When the dough has risen, scoop up the onions
in a slotted spoon & pile on top of the ring. Bake for 15 minutes,
then reduce the heat to 375F, brush the exposed surface with more
olive oil & bake another 15 to 20 minutes until golden & crispy.
Remove & slide onto a wire rack to cool.
