Title: FIT IN YOUR PANTS~ EGGPLANTS
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 lb Eggplant, peeled and cut in
1*inch cubes
1/2 c  Onion, chopped
3    Cloves garlic
1 1/4 c  Veg. broth (I use "chicken"
Flavor)
1/2 c  Rice
1/2 ts Thyme
1    Bay leaf
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper or pepper
Flakes
1 c  Crushed tomatos
Pepper to taste
Saute onions and garlic in 1/4 cup of broth until wilted. Add
eggplant and pep per and mix.  Cook for about 5 minutes. Add the rest
of the ingredients and cook c overed until the rice is done (stir
occasionally). Remove the bay leaf.  This recipe really holds in the
heat so let it cool in the pan for a while. Enjoy

*Note:  Some types of rice require different water/rice ratios.
Adjust the bro th and rice quantities accordingly. You may need to
add a little more broth or water during the cooking process.  I think
the eggplant soaks some of it up.
