Title: FRANKFURTER BUNS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Lard
3 ts Salt
2 pk Active Dry Yeast
1 ts Sugar
1 c  ;Warm Water, (115 Deg. F.)
10 1/2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
2 lg Eggs
Scald the milk in a 1-quart saucepan, over medium heat. Meanwhile
combine the sugar, lard and salt in a large mixing bowl and set
aside. Pour the milk over the sugar mixture and cool to lukewarm.
Sprinkle the yeast and 1 ts of sugar over the lukewarm water,
stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 10 minutes to proof, (become
foamy). Add the yeast mixture, 5 c of the flour, and the eggs to the
milk mixture. Beat for 2 minutes, using an electric mixer set to
Medium speed. Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
a soft dough. NOTE: The dough should be light and slightly sticky and
not heavy. This is very important because if you have to much flour
in the dough, the bread will not rise correctly. Turn the dough out
and let rest while you wash, dry and lightly grease the mixing bowl.
Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and satiny,
about 8 to 10 minutes.  Place the dough in the prepared bowl, turning
once to grease the top of the dough.  Cover and let rise in a warm
place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and divide
into fourths. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Roll each fourth
into a 9 X 4-inch rectangle. Cut into 9 (4 X 1-inch) strips. Roll
each strip to form a 5 1/2-inch cylinder. Place on greased baking
sheets, about 3-inches apart, and flatten slightly with the palm of
your hand. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake
in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for 18 minutes or until golden
brown. Remove from the baking sheets and cool on racks. When cold to
the touch, wrap in foil until ready to use.
