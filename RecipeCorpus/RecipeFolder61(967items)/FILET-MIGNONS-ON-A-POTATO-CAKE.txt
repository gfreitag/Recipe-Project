Categories: Beef, Vegetables, From cook4u, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Potatoes
5 tb Butter
4    Filet mignon, 6 oz each
2 tb Brandy
2 c  Botton mushrooms, quartered
1/2 ts Thyme
1/3 c  Beef broth
1/2 c  Sour cream
12    Green olives, halved
And pitted
2 tb Corn oil
1. Preheat the oven to 375. 2. Peel the potatoes and cut them into
slices about 1/8-in. thick. As the potatoes are sliced, drop them
into a bowl of cold water to prevent them discoloring. 3. Spread
about 1 tsp of the butter over the bottom of a large heavy skillet
with a overproof handle. Drain the potato slices and pat dry. Layer
them in the skillet, spinkling the layers with small pieces of
butter(using all but 2 tbsp). 4. Cover the skillet closely and cook
on top of the stove over moderate heat about 20 min. Uncover and
tranfer to oven. Bake 20 min. 5. Meanwhile, sprinkle the steaks with
the brandy. Set aside. 6. Heat the remaining butter in a saucepan,
add the mushrooms and thyme and cook until wilted. Add the broth and
cook until reduced by 1/3. Add thge sour cream and olives. Remove
from heat and set aside. 7. Drain the brandy from the steaks and
reserve. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and add the steaks. Cook
over high heat about 3-4 min. on each side (or longer if you prefer
your steaks medium to medium-well). Remove and keep hot. 8. Add the
brandy to the skillet and cook, stirring to dissolve the brown
particles that cling to the pan. Stir in the sour cream sauce and
heat through without boiling. 9. Turn the potato cake onto a warmed
serving dish. Arrange the steaks on top and spoon a little sauce over
them. Serve the remaining sauce separately.
