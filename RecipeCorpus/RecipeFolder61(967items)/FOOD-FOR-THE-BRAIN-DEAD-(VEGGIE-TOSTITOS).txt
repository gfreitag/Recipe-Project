Title: FOOD FOR THE BRAIN DEAD (VEGGIE TOSTITOS)
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Whole wheat tortillas
x  Refried beans
x  Toppings of choice
x  Salsa
I always try to keep a package of whole wheat tortillas in my 'fridge
and a can of refried beans in the pantry. Spread the beans on the
tortillas, add your choice of toppings or not, pop them in the
toaster oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes (they get nice and
crispy) add salsa and consume. If I'm really on top of things, I'll
make a batch on Sunday (I package of 12 tortillas = 1 can of beans),
freeze them, then thaw a few each night.
