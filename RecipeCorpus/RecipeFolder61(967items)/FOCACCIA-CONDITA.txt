Categories: Main dish, Italian, Vegetarian
Yield: 3 Pizze
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1/4 ts Dried yeast
1/2 c  Warm water
3 c  Water, room temperature
3/4 c  Durum flour biga, see recipe
7 1/2 c  Durum flour
1 tb Salt
MMMMM--------------------TOPPING FOR 3 PIZZE-------------------------
3 3/4 ts Oregano, chopped
6 tb Olive oil
2 lg Juicy tomatoes
3 ea Green onions, white part,
-- trimmed & sliced, opt.
3 ts Capers, optional
1 1/2 ts Salt
Olive oil
Cornmeal
Stir yeast into warm water in a mixing bowl & let proof for 10
minutes. Add the 3 c water & squeeze the biga into the flour through
your fingers. Whisk in the flour & the salt, 1/2 c at a time until
the dough becomes too thick to whisk.  Using your hands, continue to
mix until a dough is formed. Set it on a floured surface & knead 13
to 15 minutes until smooth & elasticy. Set dough in a large, lightly
oiled bowl, cover tightly & leave to rise in a cool spot until
tripled, 8 hours. Shape dough by turning out onto a floured surface &
divide into 3 pieces. Shape each piece into a rough ball. Oil 3 14"
or 15" pizza pans & stretch each ball of dough to cover (or roll with
a rolling pin). If the dough resists, allow it to rest for a few
minutes before resuming.  You will need a 1" rim on each dough base.
The dough can be left for up to an hour before being topped. Sprinkle
the oregano over the dough & drizzle on the oil, spreading it over
the top. Squeeze the tomato chunks right on top of the dough &
scatter the rest on top.  Add green onions & capers. Finish by
sprinkling salt over. Preheat oven to 450F.  Bake pizze until the
crusts are golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Brush edges with oil & serve
hot. VARIATION: Shape dough into 3 rounds & place on oiled baking
sheets sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover & let rise for 2 hours.  Bake
at 450F until hollwo when tapped. Makes 3 loaves.
