Recipe
After the dough has been punched down and allowed to rest (step 3):

4. On a floured board, shape the dough into a roll about 20 inches
long. with A sharp knife, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces.
Let it rest again, covered with a cloth or plastic wrap.

5. Using the palms of your hands, roll each piece of dough into a
roll 3/4 to 1 inch diameter and about 9 to 10 inches long (or
whatever size will fit on your baking sheet). Twist each piece, if
desired, to make twisted bread sticks. Place each piece on a lightly
oiled baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. (Make sure the pieces
about 2 inches apart; use 2 baking sheets, but be sure to put them on
the same rack.)

6. Cover the dough loosely with a cloth or plastic wrap and let it
rise in a warm place until doubled in size. Lightly brush each bread
stick with egg glaze sprinkle with cornmeal.

7. Preheat the oven to 350F. For soft bread sticks, bake for 12 to 15
minutes, until lightly browned. Watch carefully, or they will become
too dry if overcooked. Cool on a wire rack and store in an airtight
container. Serve warm with cilantro, garlic and cumin-spiced soft
butter. If you like harder bread sticks, bake them in a 30 oven for
about 30 minutes or until very crispy and nicely browned.
