1/2 c  Paprika
Salt
Garlic powder
Onion; dried
Pepper
Water; to make paste
--LIKE a thick finger paint
This will do about a 12lb turkey. Cut the amounts in half for a
roasting chicken. Other seasonings are to taste. I never did measure.

Here is a coating you can put on all poultry before roasting.
Basically you make a paste of the above ingredients. It should be the
consistency of finger paint; thick and not runny. If you have kids,
put them in old clothes and let them help. I smear it in and out of
the cavity. Notice that this does not have any Gravy Master or oil;
both unneeded in my opinion. The skin cooks nice and crisp. Remember
to baste during cooking.

BTW, use this in the Nuke too. Sometimes we do a turkey or chicken in
there when we have lot's of other baking/roasting to do. When Howard
was in training to be a Chef, he brought home a bunch of fellow
students for dinner. Not one of them even came close to guessing that
the turkey had been made in the nuke.

Since this has no added fat; (no usual added butter or oil); it helps
keep the turkey moist without adding calories. I have done this on
skinless breasts too. It adds minimal 'calorically'.

I simply roast the chicken/or turkey the normal way (usually with a
stuffing).  The skin is crisp and good (but probably not for you).
