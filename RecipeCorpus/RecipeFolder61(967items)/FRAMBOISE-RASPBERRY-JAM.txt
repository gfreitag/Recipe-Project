Categories: Desserts, Jams
Yield: 4 Servings
INGREDIENTS:
4 1/2 c  Fresh raspberries
3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Framboise
Servings: makes 4 - 1/2 pint jars Notes: The combination of the
delicacy of fresh raspberries and the mellow framboise (raspberry
brandy) makes a remarkable jam. Use both as a spread and as a dessert
garnish.

DIRECTIONS: Place all ingredients in heavy saucepan over medium heat.
Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. When mixture comes to a boil,
raise heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, for about 20
minutes. As mixture begins to thicken, watch carefully to prevent
sticking. When mixture has reached a jamlike consistency, immediately
remove from heat. Pour into hot sterilized jars and vacuum seal (hot
water bath method, or can be refrigerated up to 6 weeks).
