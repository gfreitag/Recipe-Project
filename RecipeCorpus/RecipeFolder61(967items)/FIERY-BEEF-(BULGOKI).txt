Title: FIERY BEEF (BULGOKI)
Categories: Korean, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Beef filet or sirloin
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Toasted sesame seed *
4 tb Light soy sauce
2 tb Water
1 tb Oil
2 tb Minced scallions
Tabasco sauce to taste
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/2 ts Freshly grated ginger
* Toasted sesame seed:  Place 1 cup sesame seed and 1 teaspoon salt
in a skillet, brown seeds slowly until they are toast colored and
puffed. Stir constantly while toasting. Remove from heat and allow to
cool. Pulverize seeds in a mortar or a blender. Store in a tightly
capped bottle.

Cut beef into very thin strips and pound to flatten; then cut into
medium size squares.  Combine all the other ingredients. The
marinade, as the name of the dish implies, should be quite fiery. Mix
meat and marinade and set aside for 4 to 5 hours, or longer if
refrigerated. Broil very quickly over hot charcoal, dip in Bulgoki
sauce (next recipe) and serve immediately with white rice.

NOTE:  The marinated beef can also be fried in hot peanut oil for
just a few minutes.
