Title: FRED'S FISH SAUCE M&M
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 Servings
3 ts Catsup
2 ts Worchestershire Sauce
2 ts A-1 Sauce
5 dr Red Pepper Sauce **
**I prefer Crystal Hot Sauce. Use what you like.

Mix together the ingredients using the basic measurements, except for
the hot sauce. Add it as needed for seasoning and heat. Adjust
seasonings with sauces to taste.

This dipping sauce is perfect for any firm white fish, such as
halibut, cod, monkfish, along those lines.

My dad (Fred) invented this sauce sometime in the forties and I've
used it all my life.

Enjoy!
