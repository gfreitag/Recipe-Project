Title: FLOUR TORTILLAS 1
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Vegetable shortening (or
-lard)
2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Salt
2 c  Tap-hot water
Combine all ingredients except water.  Add water slowly, until dough
is soft, but does not stick to hands. Knead dough until satiny.
Softer dough is easier to roll. Make 2 inch balls of dough, and
flatten, roll on floured surface with a light rolling pin. Cook on
cast iron griddle, that has been preheated.  Griddle should be hot
enough to burn dough in less than 20 seconds.   Adjustments are
neces- sary, especially on electric stoves. Heat is approximately 300
F. Yield: 1 dozen.
