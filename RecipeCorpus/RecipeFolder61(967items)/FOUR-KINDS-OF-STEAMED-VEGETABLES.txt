Title: FOUR KINDS OF STEAMED VEGETABLES
Categories: Chinese
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Stalks canned baby corn
1 cn Peeled straw mushrooms
2 md Size fresh tomatoes
8 sm Stalks of bok choy
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Chicken stock
1 ts Peanut oil
1/4 ts Sugar
Cornstarch paste
2 tb Chicken oil (rendered fat)
Preparation:  Have water in steamer boiling.  Dip tomatoes to loosen
skins; remove skins; slice in half. Wash and trim bok choy stalks.
Use slender end of stalk only (use leaves and thick stalk in other
dish). Drain baby corn and straw mushrooms.

Steaming:  First steam baby corn and straw mushrooms for 5 minutes.
Place tomatoes and bok choy on separate plate; sprinkle with salt;
steam for 3 minutes; drain. Arrange vegetables on warm round serving
platter in flower pattern.

Sauce:  To render chicken fat, place pieces in small saucepan with a
few drops of oil to prevent sticking. Cook on medium heat for 20
minutes or so, until chicken oil separates from solids. Drain oil,
reserve. Alternatively, make aromatic oil by steeping several peeled
garlic cloves in hot cooking oil (after removing it from heat). In
small saucepan, heat chicken stock, peanut oil and sugar.  When it
starts to boil, dribble in enough cornstarch paste to give a light
body. Keep warm until ready to use. When vegetables are being
steamed, reheat sauce with chicken oil. Pour sauce over vegetables.
Serve.
