Title: FLANK STEAK MEPHISTO
Categories: Beef
Yield: 1112 Servings  3 tablespoon prepared dijon mustard 2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1 minced clove garlic optional 1
tablespoon whole coarsely cracked peppercorns optional

Put steak on cutting board and make shallow diagonal cut with point of
sharp knife. Continue making shallow cuts about 1/2 inch apart, then
make cuts in opposite direction so surface of steak is scored in
diamond crisscross pattern. TUrn steak over and repeat on opposite
side. This cuts through surface fibers and keeps steak from curling
as it cooks, and makes it easier to slice, too. Be careful not to cut
too deeply.

Spread both sides of steak with combination of mustard, worcester-
hire sauce, soy and minced garlic, if desired. Spread peppercorns
evenly over one side of steak, if desired.

To crack peppercorns, put them in plastic bag and hit with hammer or
other handy unbreakable object, just until peppercorns are very
coarsely cracked, texture should be much coarser than commercially
available cracked pepper.

Broil, barbecue or pan fry steak, in nonstick skillet sprayed with
cooking spray, peppercorn side down first, to desired doneness, about
4-6 minutes each side depending on thickness.
