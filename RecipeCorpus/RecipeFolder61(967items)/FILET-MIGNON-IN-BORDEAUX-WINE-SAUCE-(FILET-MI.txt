Salt and pepper

1 tb Shallots chopped fine
1/2 c  Dry red wine

1. Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper to taste. Heat the oil in a
large skillet, large enough to hold the slices in one layer. Brown
the meat on both sides, about 1-2 min. to a side. Or cook longer if
you prefer meat well done. 2. Transfer the meat to a heated serving
platter and keep warm. 3. Pour off the fat from the skillet. Add 1
tbsp of the butter and when it is hot, add the shallots. Cook
briefly, stirring, then add the wine. Cook until almost reduced by
half. Stir in the brown sauce and cook about 2 min. 4. Put the sauce
through a fine strainer into a small saucepan. Add salt and pepper to
taste. Swril in the remaining butter. Spoon the sauce over the meat
and garnish with watercress.
