Preheat oven to 350~. Grease a 9" square pan. Line bottom & two side
with foil, letting foil extend over the edges. Grease foil. Combine
flour, oats, sugar, salt & soda. Cut butter into pieces & add to
mixture, cutting in until the mixture is moist & crumbly. Remove 1
1/2 cups of these crumbs & set aside, press remaining crumbs into the
pan. Spread jam to within 1/4" of the edge of the pan. Sprinkle
remaining crumb mixture on top of jam. Bake until golden brown, about
45-55 min. Cool completely, before cutting into bars.
