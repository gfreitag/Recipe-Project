Title: FETTUCINI WITH PESTO
Categories: Seasonings, Italian, Main dish, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Fettucini
2 c  Fresh basil leaves; packed
2    Garlic cloves; peeled
Salt and pepper; to taste
1 c  Olive oil
3 tb Pine nuts
1/2 c  Fresh grated Parmesan cheese
"Whether using fresh pasta or a dried variety, figure on 3 or 4
ounces of uncooked pasta for each person for a main course. We like
to make some extra so the leftover noodles can be cooked into an
Italian frittata - a type of omelet - the next day."

Bring a large pot of cold, salted water to a rolling boil. Add
fettucini and cook, uncovered, 5 to 7 minutes for fresh, 8 to 10
minutes for dried, packaged noodles.

Pesto Sauce:  Blend all ingredients except olive oil in container of
electric blender or food processor, just until mixed. Gradually pour
in olive oil in thin stream until of desired consistency. It can be
smooth or slightly crunchy.  If freezing, do not add Parmesan. Put in
small, airtight containers to freeze; thaw before using, adding
Parmesan, then hot pasta water, to heat through.

Drain cooked pasta in a colander, reserving 2 tb. of the hot pasta
water. Blend hot pasta water with pesto sauce to heat; toss well with
fettucini.

Serve in heated bowls and pass with extra Parmesan and more freshly
grated black pepper. To complete a simple meal, serve with a loaf of
crusty Italian bread and a salad of romaine lettuce with fresh,
sliced tomatoes.

Note:  When I freeze pesto, I put a thin film of olive oil on the top
to prevent darkening.  Pesto turns darker when exposed to air.
