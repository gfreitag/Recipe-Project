1 ea In a small, heavy saucepan

saucepan over low heat, simmer the milk, salt, the remaining sugar,
and the cinnamon until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let
cool to room temperature. 3. In a bowl, mix the whole egg and egg
yolks until lemon-colored. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the
cooled milk, stir, add the vanilla, and mix well. 4. Pour the mixture
into the caramelized pan, set it into a larger pan on the middle oven
rack, and pour lukewarm water into the outer pan, reaching two thirds
of the way up the side of the custard. 5. Bake 1 hour, uncover, and
insert a cake tester in the center to see if it is set. (Or use Mama
Nena's method: shake the pan, and if the custard is wobbly, it is not
done. ) If not set, cook the custard, uncovered, another 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven and the water bath, let cool to room
temperature, cover, and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours. 6. To serve, run a
knife around the inside edges of the pan, invert the custard onto a
serving plate, and spoon the caramel over it. Makes 6 to 8 servings
