Put all the vegetables and the rosemary in a deep pan. Cover with
water and add salt and pepper to taste -- about 1 tblspn salt and 1
tspn pepper. Bring to a boil gradually over low heat. Cover pot and
simmer the soup gently for 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until all the flavors
are well blended. Taste and correct the seasoning. Serve with
crackers, cheese, or whatever you'd like. * Examples of variations *
First day: Enough soup for four people. Serve as described above.
Second day: Add to the remainder another couple of peeled and chopped
tomatoes, a few leaves of finely chopped spinach, another zucchini,
and a few leftover cooked chickpeas. Add a bit of grated lemon rind
and a touch of onion about 10 minutes before serving. Third day: For
lunch, the soup is good cold with a dollop of creme frai'che. Fourth
day: Add 2 or 3 peeled and diced beets, another cup of finely
chopped, cooked cabbage, 3 or 4 more mushrooms, and if any, a little
left over vegetable broth cooked from another day. NOTE: Of course,
if you have some chicken or vegetable broth you can add it to the
soup. The secret is to have variations of color, texture and flavor.
