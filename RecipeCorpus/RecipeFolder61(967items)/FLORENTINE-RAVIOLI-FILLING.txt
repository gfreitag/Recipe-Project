Title: FLORENTINE RAVIOLI FILLING
Categories: Pasta, Cheese, Italian
Yield: 1 Batch
16 oz Ricotta, skim milk
2    Eggs
6 oz Mozzarella; shredded
3 tb Parsley, fresh; chopped
2    Garlic clove; chopped
1/2 pk Spinach, frozen chopped;
-thawed & drained
4 oz Parmesan or Romano; grated
In a large mixing bowl beat the ricotta and eggs until fluffy and well
combined. Add the parsley, garlic and spinach and mix together with a
spoon.  Stir in the shredded cheese and stuff into prepared ravioli
pasta. This is also a wonderful filling for manicotti, large pasta
shells, and as the cheese filling for a truly sinful lasgna.  I
almost forgot, I add a healthy dose of fresh cracked pepper.

BTW, be sure you drain and squeeze as much water as possible out of
the spinach or the filling will be very runny.

If you want to try the wonton wrappers place a tablespoon or so of
filling in the middle of one wrapper, cover with another wrapper
being careful to press all of the air out as you seal the two
together. You can get a good seal if you brush the edges with a
little water first. If you don't press out the air the ravioli tend
to burst when you boil them. Drop a few at a time into rapidly
boiling water and remove when they float to the top. Serve with your
favorite sauce (nice with marinara or alfredo). You might try a dash
of nutmeg in the filling as a variation, seems to me it would be very
nice with the cheese and spinach.
