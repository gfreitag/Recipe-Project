Title: FILETS OF SOLE RENDEZVOUS
Categories: France, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Small filets of sole
18    Large whole spinach leaves
Clam broth
Very light sauce
If frozen fish is used, let it thaw entirely in the refrigerator.
Thoroughly wash spinach and remove heavy stems. Steam in water that
clings to the leaves only until they are limp. Set aside. Pat fish
filets dry and roll each one neatly. Secure with thread ***  at top
and bottom. Arrange rolled fillets in a large shallow saucepan and
pour in clam broth to come half way up the filets. Bring broth to a
boil, then reduce heat so that the liquid barely  simmers. Poach,
covered, until filets are just opaque, about 5 minutes. Remove from
heat. Make Very Light sauce. To serve, place one rolled filet on each
serving plate and remove the threads. Arrange steamed spinach over
the fish and top with Very Light Sauce. You may place the dish under
the broiler for a minute or two if you wish. Serves 6.
