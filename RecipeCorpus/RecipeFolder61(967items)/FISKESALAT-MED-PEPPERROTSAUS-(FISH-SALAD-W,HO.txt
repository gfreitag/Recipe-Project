If you are using bottled, prepared horseradish, drain it through a
fine sieve, pressing out the excess juices with a wooden spoon or
squeeze it dry through a kitchen towel or double thickness of
cheesecloth. In a large mixing bowl, combine the horseradish, sour
cream, salt, pepper, onions, vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the chopped
dill. Break the fish into 2" chunks and carefully fold it into the
sour-cream dressing with a rubber spatula. Marinate for at least 30
minutes in the refrigerator, then arrange the fish, sauce and all, on
a bed of dried, chilled lettuce leaves. Garnish with the sliced eggs
and tomato wedges and, just before serving, strew the remaining
tablespoon of chopped dill over the salad.
