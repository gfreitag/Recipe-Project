Title: FRANK'S EGGPLANT SICILIANO
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1 qt Marinara sauce
1 lg Eggplant, peeled & sliced
1 lb Italian sausage, pan sauteed
1 lb Mozzarella cheese
2 c  Grated Romano cheese
1 ts Garlic powder
4 ts Basil leaves
2 ts Oregano
Black pepper to taste
First, take a 10 x 14 glass baking pan and coat the sides and
bottom with the olive oil. Then pour a cup of the marinara sauce into
the pan and spread it out evenly.
Next, place a layer of the sliced eggplant in the pan (making sure
to work it into the sauce). Then spread on another half-cup or so of
sauce to cover the eggplant. Now SPRINKLE on some Italian sausage ...
then some mozzarella...then some Romano...then some garlic
powder...then some basil...then some oregano. Just try to get the
SPRINKLINGS as evenly distributed as possible.
At this point, ladle on another cup of the sauce, spread it
around, and cover it with another layer of eggplant. Now repeat the
entire process over and over again until all the ingredients are
used, and top off the dish with a heavy layer of mozzarella.
Now, preheat your oven to 350 degrees, season to taste with the
black pepper, and cover the dish TIGHTLY with heavy-duty aluminum
foil. All that's left is to bake it in the upper third of your oven
for about an hour (or until the eggplant is soft and tender), then
cool for about 20 minutes before serving.
