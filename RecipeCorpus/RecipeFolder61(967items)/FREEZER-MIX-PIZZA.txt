Heat oven to 425'. Mix baking mix and yeast; stir in water and beat

about 20 times. Let dough rest a few minutes. While dough is resting,

Divide dough in half. Roll each half on ungreased baking sheet into
rectangle, 13x10 inches, or on pizza pan into 12-inch circle. Pinch
edges to make a slight rim. Spread Meat Mixture almost to edges. Top
with green pepper and cheeses. Bake until crust is brown and filling
is hot and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut into squares or wedges.
