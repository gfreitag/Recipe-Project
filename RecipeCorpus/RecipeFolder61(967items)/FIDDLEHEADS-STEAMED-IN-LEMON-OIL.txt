Polk wrote: "It's just about fiddlehead fern time here in the
Northeast and perhaps in other areas down the Mid Atlantic. Molly
O'Neill in the Boston Globe today featured them. She wrote:
;Fiddlehead ferns epitomize vernal ephemera. Coiled as they are like
tiny watch springs, fiddle heads are a sign: edible when tight and
young, they become when fully unfurled unfit for human consumption."
Fiddleheads are rare and fleeting and thus precious. And contentious.
Which is as it should be.'"
