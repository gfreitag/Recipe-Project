Deep-frying Rice Stick:  Break up rice stick before measuring. Heat

heating until it just begins to smoke; add drained pork & stir-fry
briskly for about 2 minutes. Add bamboo, garlic & ginger. Toss with
pork for 1 minute. Re-stir liquids and add to wok.  Cover wok, &
simmer for 3 minutes. Remove cover; turn up heat again; boil briefly
to reduce sauce; sprinkle on vinegar.  Ladle over rice stick & serve.
