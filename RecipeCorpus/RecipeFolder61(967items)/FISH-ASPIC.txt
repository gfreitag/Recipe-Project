1 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Lemon juice
2    Onions, sliced

In a kettle, combine the fish trimmings and bones, wine, lemon juice,
onions, and herbs.  Bring mixture to a boil, stirring frequently to
prevent scorching, and boil it until liquid is reduced by half. Add 8
cups water and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil, and skim
it. Simmer for 20 minutes, strain it into a large saucepan, and let
it cool. Skim again. Sprinkle gelatin over the stock and add the egg
whites, beaten to stiff peaks, and the shells, crushed. (Do not stir
in.) Bring stock slowly to a boil over moderate heat, whisking
constantly. Remove pan from heat and let stand for 30 minutes. Strain
the aspic through a fine sieve lined with a dampened kitchen towel.
Let it cool. To apply to a dish, cool only until just thickened and
paint or spoon onto the fish or other dish. To solidify, chill in
refrigerator. Makes about 8 cups. Gourmet Mag.
