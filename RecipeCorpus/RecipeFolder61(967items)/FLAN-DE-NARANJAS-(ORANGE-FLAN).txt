2 c  Light cream or half-and-half
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
6 lg Eggs
1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
1 tb Finely grated orange peel
pn Of salt
cn Mandarin orange sections,

For garnish
1 ea Preheat the oven to 350
-degrees. In a small, heavy
-skillet over
medium heat, cook 1/2 cup of the sugar, stirring frequently after it
begins to bubble, until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Be careful that
it does not burn. Remove from the heat, divide the syrup among 6 to 8
custard cups (depending upon their size), or pour into a 2-quart
ovenproof mold, and swirl to coat the bottom. 2. In a small, heavy
saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream, the remaining sugar,
and vanilla, heat until bubbles begin to form around the sides, and
remove from the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, orange
juice, peel, and salt, and whisk until smooth and light. Add the
cream mixture and mix well. 3. Strain the mixture through a fine
sieve into the caramelized custard cups or mold, place in a large
pan, and fill the outer pan with lukewarm water two thirds the height
of the cups or mold. 4. Bake 1 hour for a large mold or slightly less
for custard cups, or until a cake tester inserted in the flan comes
out clean, then remove from the water bath, cool to room temperature,
cover, and refrigerate. 5. To unmold, run a knife along the edge of
the mold and invert it onto a serving platter. Spoon the caramel over
the flan and serve at once, garnished with the oranges. Makes 6 to 8
