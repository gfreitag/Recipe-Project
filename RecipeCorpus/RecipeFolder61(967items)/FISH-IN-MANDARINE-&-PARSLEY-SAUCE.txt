2    To 4 mandarines
4    Fish fillets
4    To 8 mandarines, juice only
1    Piece fresh ginger, grated,
-2 cm
1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
2 lg Onions, chopped
2    To 3 cloves garlic, chopped
3 tb Olive oil
Use any good meaty fish fillets for this dish. Grate the mandarine
peel with a light hand on a sharp grater or it will tear.

Grate the zest of 2-4 mandarines (depending on size). Place 4 fish
fillets (about 800g) in a large dish and pour over them the juice of
4-8 mandarines mixed with 2 cm fresh ginger, grated. Cover and leave
in the refrigerator, turning occasionally, for up day or at least one
hour.

Finely chop 1 cupful or more of fresh parsley, 2 large onions and 2-3
large cloves of garlic. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium
size saucepan, add the parsley, onion and garlic mixture, cover the
pan and sweat gently, stirring from time to time, until the onion is
almost melting.

Heat the grill to very hot, drain the mandarine fish mari- nade into
to onions and add the zest. Simmer the onions and marinade,
uncovered, until the excess liquid disappears. Puree in a food
processor, blend or sieve and add salt and pepper to taste. Reheat
gently. Meanwhile, dry the fish fillets, brush them with olive oil
and grill them for a couple of minutes on each turning only once,
until the fish flakes at its thickest point. Serve with the sauce.
