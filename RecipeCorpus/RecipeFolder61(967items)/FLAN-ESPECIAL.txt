Yield: 1 Servings

Ingredients: 1 medium orange 1 lime 1 quart milk 3/4 cup sugar pinch
of salt 3/4 cup  sugar 6 eggs Peel orange and lime into thin strips
with as little white pith as possible. (the rest of the fruit will
not be used in this recipe)

Combine peel, milk, 3/4 cup sugar and salt in a large pan. Bring it
to a boil and cook gently until it is reduced to 3 cups. (stir
occasionally to break the film that forms on the surface) When done,
strain and cool slightly.

In the meantime, heat 3/4 cup sugar in a skillet over medium heat
until sugar begins to melt.  Reduce heat to medium and continue to
cook, stirring occasionally. When sugar is melted and brown,
immediately spoon over bottom and sides of a shallow 11/2 quart
baking dish and cool.

Begin preheating oven to 325 F.

Beat eggs into a large bowl.  Gradually add warm milk mixture to eggs
and beat well.  Then, pour the mixture into the baking dish
containing the caramelized sugar.

Place the baking dish into a pan and pour water into the pan until it
reaches half way up the sides of the baking dish. Bake about 11/2
hours or until a knife inserted offcenter comes out clean. If
necessary, cover loosely with foil to prevent excess browning.

Remove dish from hot water and cool.  Then refrigerate for at least 3
hours.  Run a knife around the edge and invert onto a platter just
before serving. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
