CHINESE PORK SAUSAGE BUNS (Lop Cheung Bow)

DOUGH: 1/2 recipe of basic bun dough.

FILLING: 6 pairs of Chinese pork sausage, cut into halves. You should
have 24 3-inch sausages. [These are very good, sweet sausages. I
can't think of anything to substitute for them. S.C.]

Divide dough into 24 balls.  Roll each ball into 2-inch rounds.

Place sausage in middle and fold dough over, leaving ends open. Place
seam side down on square piece of was paper. Let rise in warm place
for 1 hour or so.

Steam for 10 minutes.  Pork Sausage Buns can also be baked at 350F
for 20 to 25 minutes.  Mix beaten egg whites with a little water and
sugar and brush buns (to keep crust soft). Brush with melted butter
when done.
