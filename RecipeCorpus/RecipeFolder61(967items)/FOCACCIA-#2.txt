Title: FOCACCIA #2
Categories: Italian, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Unbleached flour
2/3    Fresh cake yeast,
Dissolved in 2/3 cup warm
Water
10 tb Olive oil
1/3 c  Water
2 1/2 ts Salt
Mix 2 cups flour with the dissolved yeast.  Knead the dough for 10
minutes, either by hand or in the bowl of an electric mixture with a
dough hook.  Shape the dough into a ball, and put in an oiled bowl to
rise until doubled in bulk, about 3 hours.

Punch down, put the dough on a floured board, and knead again,
incorporating the remaining flour, 1/3 cup olive oil, water, and salt.
Knead until dough is smooth and elastic. Let rise again in a covered
bowl for another 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Divide the dough in half and roll out on a well-floured board to
circles or squares 1/2 inch thick. Brush with the remaining olive oil
and press the topping of your choice into the top of each circle.
Bake on a baking sheet until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve
warm or at room temperature, cut into wedges, squares, or triangles.

NOTE:  Slashes may be made in a decorative or random pattern in the
breads before baking.
