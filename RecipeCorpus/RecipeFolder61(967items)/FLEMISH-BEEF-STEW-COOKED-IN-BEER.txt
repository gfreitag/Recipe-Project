Title: FLEMISH BEEF STEW COOKED IN BEER
Categories: Stews, Belgian, Flemish
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lb Beef stew meat; 2" cubes
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Flour; to 3 tb
3 tb Unsalted butter; to 4 tb
3 lg Onions; thinly sliced
24 oz Belgian beer
2    Sprigs thyme; to 3 sprigs
2    Bay leaves
1 1/2 tb Red currant jelly
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1. Season beef cubes with salt and pepper and coat with flour. Shake
off any excess.

2. In a large, heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over high
heat until hot, but not smoking. Add beef cubes and saute until
nicely browned on all sides. Work in batches so as not to crowd beef
cubes or they will steam instead of saute. Add another tablespoon of
butter, if needed. Transfer beef to a heavy Dutch oven.

3. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skiller over medium
heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned,
about 15 minutes. Combine onions and meat in Dutch oven.

4. Add beer to skillet. Raise heat to high and bring to a boil,
scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any
browned bits.

5. Pour beer over meat. Add thyme and bay leaves. Simmer, covered,
over low heat until meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

6. Just before servig, stir in jelly and vinegar; simmer for 5
minutes. Remove thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Taste, adding more salt
and pepper if needed.
