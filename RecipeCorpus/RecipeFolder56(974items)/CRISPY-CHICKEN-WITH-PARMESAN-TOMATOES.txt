About 50 minutes before serving:

Preheat the oven to 400 Degrees F.  In a small bowl, mix the bread
crumbs, chopped parsley, minced garlic, 2 ts of the olive or salad
oil, and 1/4 ts of the pepper, blending well. Brush the Dijon style
mustard onto the skin side of the chicken-breast halves, then coat
with the bread crumb mixture, firmly pressing the coating mixture
into the chicken. Spray an 11 X 7-inch glass or ceramic baking dish
with non stick cooking spray. Place the chicken, skin side up, in the
baking dish. Bake the chicken, without turning, for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut each tomato, lengthwise, in half. On waxed paper, mix
the Parmesan cheese, oregano, salt and 1/4 ts of black pepper,
stirring to mix well. Sprinkle the cheese mixture over the tomato
halves.  Add the tomatoes to the chicken in the baking dish and bake
for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until the coating on the
chicken is crispy and browned and the juices run clear when the
chicken is pierced with the tip of a knife.

To Serve:

Toss the watercress with the salad dressing.  Arrange the tomatoes,
chicken and the salad on 2 plates and sit down to eat.
