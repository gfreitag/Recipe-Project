This chicken and vegetable soup is an Argentinean classic. It is as
thick as a stew and as creamy as a bisque.

Preheat oven to 400F.

Spread half of the onions in a large, deep baking dish. Place chicken
on top.  Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle garlic, thyme and bay
leaves over chicken. Spread remaining onions on top; drizzle with 1
cup stock. Roast uncovered for 30 minutes, or until chicken turns
golden around the edges.

Place chicken (remove skin, if desired), onions, garlic and herbs in a
6-quart soup pot.  Deglaze roasting pan with some water or stock and
add to the pot. Add the remaining stock and the potatoes to the pot.

Simmer for 15 minutes, then add the carrots and corn. Simmer for 25
minutes.

Using a wide fork, roughly mash at least 4 of the "falling apart"
potato chunks to help thicken the soup.

Beat egg yolk into the cream, then beat in 1/2 cup of the stock from
the soup pot.  Blend in the arrowroot if you want a thicker soup.
Pour the cream mixture back into the soup, stirring until
well-blended.

Just before serving, add the minced parsley and cilantro. Ladle into
wide, deep soup bowls.  Make sure each bowl has a chunk of potato, a
piece of chicken, a couple of carrots and a piece of corn.

Serves 6.
