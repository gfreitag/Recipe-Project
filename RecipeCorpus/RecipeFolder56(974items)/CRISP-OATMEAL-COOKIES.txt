Title: CRISP OATMEAL COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  White sugar
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1    Egg
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Oatmeal
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/4    To 1/2 cup ground walnuts
Cream the sugars and the butter until the mixture is very smooth.

Blend in the egg and the vanilla.  Mix in the oatmeal.

Sift together the flour, soda and salt.  Blend that into the dough.
It will be a very soft dough.  Let it stand for a few minutes to firm
up. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350F.

Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto a cookie sheet, leaving 2
inches between dough mounds. Sprinkle each with some ground nuts,
pressing them into the dough and flattening the cookies at the same
time. Bake for 10 minutes, until cookies are uniformly brown.

Makes approximately 18 cookies, 4 1/2 inches in diameter.
