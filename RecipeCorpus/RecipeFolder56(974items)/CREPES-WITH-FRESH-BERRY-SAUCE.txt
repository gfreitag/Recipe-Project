Yield: 1 Servings
3    Eggs
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Cream sherry
-melted butter for cooking
1 qt Fresh blueberies OR

1/4 c  Cream sherry
2/3 c  All purpose flour

Crepes: (Makes about twelve 6- to 7-inch crepes) Beat the eggs in a
large mixing bowl.  Combine the flour, salt, and sugar and, in a
separate bowl, combine the sherry and milk. Gradually add the dry
ingredients to the eggs, alternately with the milk mixture. Beat
until smooth. Let the batter stand, covered with plastic wrap, for 30
minutes. Heat a crepe pan over moderate heat and lightly brush with
melted butter. When butter is hot, add just enough batter to cover
the bottom of the pan, tilting the pan and distributing the batter to
make a very thin crepe. Cook until brown underneath and quickly turn
and cook the other side. Continue cooking crepes until all of the
batter is used, brushing pan with butter as necessary. Sauce: Reserve
1/4 cup berries for garnish. In a bowl combine the berries with sugar
to taste. Add the sherry and mix lightly. To serve, fill each crepe
with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and 2 tablespoons of the
sauce.  Fold the crepe into the desired shape and top with a small
dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with a fresh berry. Serves 4 to 6.
