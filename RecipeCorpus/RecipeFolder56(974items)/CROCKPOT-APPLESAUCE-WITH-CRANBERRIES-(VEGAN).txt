Title: CROCKPOT APPLESAUCE WITH CRANBERRIES (VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Dec., Crockpot
Yield: 1 Servings
10    12 medium apples
1    To 2 cups cranberry juice
1/2    Lemon juiced
2 tb Sugar, or up to 1/4cup if
You want it sweet
1/4    To 1/2 cup dried cranberries
Or "craisins" (sweetened
Dried
Cranberries)
Wash the apples and chop them up without peeling. Squeeze lemon juice
over them as you cut them.

Put apples in crockpot with cranberry juice -- use 1 cup if you want
the applesauce thick, more if you want it thin. Stir in sugar to suit
your taste.

Let apples stew on low for 6-8 hours.  About an hour or two before
serving, stir in cranberries or craisins. (All I found at my store was
craisins--since they're sweetened, I used less sugar.)

The applesauce is a very pretty pink and the cranberries & juice give
it a nice zing.

As you can see, the recipe is simple and forgiving -- let the apples
stew a little longer or a little less ~- the longer you stew them the
mushier the applesauce will be. It warms up nicely, or you can eat it
cold.
