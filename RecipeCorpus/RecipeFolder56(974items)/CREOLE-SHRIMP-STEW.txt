* Instead of using bacon fat to blend with the flour, it can be
drained off and you can use oil. cook bacon in large, heavy pan over
medium heat until fat escapes and bacon is crisp. Blend in flour and
whisk until it burns a peanut brown color. Add celery, onion, green
pepper and green onions and cook, stirring until vegetables soften,
about 10 minutes. Blend in tomato paste, seafood stock, water, lemon
juice, sugar and spices to taste. Stir to blend mixture into a roux.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer very slowly, stirring
frequently, until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Add uncooked,
shelled, deveined shrimp and parsley and continue to cook over low
heat, just until shrimp turn pink. taste and adjust seasonings. Serve
hot over hot rice. 4 servings. By Christophe Ritoux, Cajun House,
