Categories: Poultry, Chinese, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1    (3 1/2-lb) chicken
Chicken stock or water
Oil
3    Lemons; juiced. Reserving:
1    -Squeezed lemon half
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
1 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Cornstarch
Lemon peel triangles (opt.)
Cook chicken in simmering chicken stock to almost cover until nearly
tender, about 20 minutes. Remove and suspend over bowl to dry at room
temperature at least 4 hours, or until chicken is thoroughly cooled.
Heat enough oil to 350F in wok to deep-fry whole chicken. Add chicken
and fry 20 minutes, turning until golden on all sides. Meanwhile,
combine lemon juice with squeezed lemon half, sugar and water in
saucepan. Bring to boil and simmer 2 to 3 minutes until sugar is
dissolved. Add 2 teaspoons oil and soy sauce. Remove from heat and
set aside. Split chicken in halves down back and cut into serving
pieces. Reassemble on serving platter and garnish with triangles of
lemon peel which have been cut with serrated knife, if desired. Bring
reserved lemon sauce to boil again. Mix cornstarch with small amount
of cold water to make paste and stir into lemon sauce. Cook,
stirring, until thickened slightly. Spoon over chicken pieces.
