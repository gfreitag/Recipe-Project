Remove giblets and neck from chicken.  Stuff garlic and bay leaves
into chicken cavity.  Place in crockpot, breast side down, and add
onions, carrots, and potatoes. Add wine and seasonings. If there is
still plenty of room in the crockpot, add stock. Remember that
chicken juices will raise the liquid level in the crockpot during
cooking. Cook on LOW all day.

Sylvia's comments: fine, flavorful recipe.  I thickened the juices and
served over noodles.
