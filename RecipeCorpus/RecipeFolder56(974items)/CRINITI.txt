Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM-------------------ROMULAN SPICE COOKIES------------------------
1 c  Butter
2 c  Brown sugar
2    Eggs
2 2/3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Walnuts, chopped
1 c  Raisins
1/3 c  Milk
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar together.
Add the eggs and stir vigorously until the mixture is well blended.
In a small bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients except the
raisins and walnuts. Then add the dry ingredients and the milk to the
butter mixture, stir it in gently, and when it is all moistened, stir
hard to mix it all together evenly. You should have a stiff batter.
Fold in the raisins and nuts and mix them in well. Grease your cookie
sheet, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Drop the dough onto the
sheet by the spoonful. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the
cookies just begin to brown at the edges and a toothpick comes out
clean.
