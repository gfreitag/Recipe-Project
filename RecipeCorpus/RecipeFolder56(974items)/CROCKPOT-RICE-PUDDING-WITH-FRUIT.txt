Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 3:00 * Use half nonfat
and half whole milk, or all nonfat for lower fat content.

Substitute canned milk for the regular milk for a very rich
flavor. The cooking time will vary greatly, anywhere from 1-1/2 to
3-1/2 hours. The longer it cooks the thicker it will be.
It is important to have the dried apricots minced. Put all
ingredients into crockpot. Stir to blend well. Cover and cook on high
1- 1/2 hours, stir once after about 1 hour. Or, cook on high for the
first 30 minutes, turn to low and cook as long as you desire. Check
after the first 2 hours of low cooking and stir. If rice is not
absorbing the milk quickly enough, turn the crockpot up to high
again. Keep cover on at all times.

Crockpot temperatures vary widely among different brands. Only
experimentation can tell you the correct amount of time for cooking
in your crockpot. Rarely will a crockpot recipe fail, though, as the
long, slow cooking process does not require precise timing.
