2 tb Bacon fat; divided
1 md Onion
1 cl Garlic

Mince onion and garlic finely, then grind in a mortar and pestle until
pureed.

In a large skillet, add 1 tb bacon fat and gently fry the ground
pork. Add the pureed onion and garlic together with the spices and
continue  to cook. Take off the fire.

After mixture cools, press the mixture through a sieve to form a
puree. Add the beef stock or milk so the mixture is spreadable.

over the top to seal and add extra flavour. Refrigerate until used.

Serve on crackers as a snack or on toast for a hearty breakfast.

This recipe is reconstructed by Roslind Minault from childhood
memories of how her grandfather used to make it on the family farm in
Rocky Lane, Alberta. The concept originated in Quebec and is
distinctly French-Canadian.
