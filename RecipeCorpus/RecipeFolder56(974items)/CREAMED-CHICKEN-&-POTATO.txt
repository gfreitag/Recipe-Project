This dish takes very little to prepare and is easy for baby to digest.

Melt butter in small heavy pan over low heat.  Stir in flour and blend
well.  Add milk and stir until smooth.

Cook over low heat until mixture begins to thicken, then add chicken
and potatoes and stir for about 2 to 3 minutes more or until heated
through. Feel free to add a few vegetables. Add cheddar and stir
until melted.

Serves 1-3
