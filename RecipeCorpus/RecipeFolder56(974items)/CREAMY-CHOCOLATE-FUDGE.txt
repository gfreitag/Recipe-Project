Title: CREAMY CHOCOLATE FUDGE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
2 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Evaporated milk
-or thin cream
2 tb Corn syrup
3 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla
Grease an 8x8" square pan with butter. Grease a heavy-bottomed
saucepan with butter. Grate the chocolate into it and add the sugar,
milk and corn syrup. Stir over low heat until chocolate melts and
sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil the
mixture until it reaches soft ball stage (240F.). Stir just enough to
prevent scorching., remove from the heat and add the butter. Cool to
lukewarm (110F.) without stirring. Add the vanilla. Beat until the
candy loses its gloss and becomes thick enough to hold its shape.
This will take 10 minutes if you use a heavy electric mixer and
longer by hand. Immediately pat into the prepared pan. Cool and cut
into squares. Yields 36 pieces.
