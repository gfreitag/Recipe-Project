Title: CROCKPOT LEMON-GARLIC CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Crockpot
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Chicken
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  Garlic cloves; crushed
1 ts Seasoned salt
1 ts Poultry seasoning
2 ds Tabasco
1 c  White wine
Skin and cut up chicken.  Combine with other ingredients in crockpot.
Set on low.  Upon return from work, debone chicken. Serve over rice.
If you freeze chicken pieces separately, and mix up other ingredients
the night before, you can dump it all together quickly in the
morning. And if you start with frozen chicken it doesn't fall apart.
