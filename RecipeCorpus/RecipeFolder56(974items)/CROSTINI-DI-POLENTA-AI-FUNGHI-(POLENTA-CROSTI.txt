MMMMM--------------------------POLENTA-------------------------------
6 c  Water
2 1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Cornmeal, finely ground
Olive oil
Soak the porcini mushrooms in warm water to cover for at least 45
minutes. Carefully remove from liquid & rinse well under cold water.
Chop roughly & pat dry. Heat olive oil in a heavy saute pot & saute
onion until it is translucent & soft.  Add the garlic & all the
mushrooms. Reduce heat to low & cook, stirring intermittently, for 20
to 25 minutes, until tender. Add the tomatoes, parsley, salt & pepper
& cook for another 5 minutes. POLENTA: Bring the salted water to
vigorous boil in a large pot. Reduce heat to low & slowly sprinkle in
the cornmeal in a thin stream, first whisking it in & then stirring
constantly being careful to eliminate any lumps. Keep the water at a
steady simmer & stir frequently. When it comes away from the side of
the pot, after 20 or 25 minutes, then it is cooked. Check for salt.
Allow to cool by pouring onto a baking sheet & patting until it is as
smooth as possible. Cut the polnta into slices that are 2" wide & 3"
to 4" long.  Brush lightly with the olive oil.  Broil until they are
firm & lightly crisp on both sides.  Place a spoonful of the hot
mushroom sauce on the top of each crostini & serve. Can be served as
an appetizer, as an antipasto, as a side dish or as a main dish.
