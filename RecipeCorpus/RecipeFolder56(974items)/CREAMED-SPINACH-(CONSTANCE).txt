Title: CREAMED SPINACH (CONSTANCE)
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 bn Of English spinach or
1    Of silverbeet
1    White bread roll, soaked in
-water *
3 tb Oil
4 tb Plain flour
Stock (or milk)
2    Cloves of garlic, finely
-chopped
Salt
* (or milk when serving a dairy-based meal)

Wash the spinach thoroughly, slice and put it into a saucepan over
brisk heat.  (The spinach will cook in the water still on the
leaves.) Cook until limp and tender. Squeeze the liquid out of the
roll and sieve the roll and the spinach together or blend them to a
puree in a food processor.

In a saucepan, gently heat 3 tablespoons oil, add the garlic and when
it is bubbling add the plain flour to make a paste or roux. Stir over
the heat until the roux changes colour to beige. Add the spinach
mixture and enough stock or milk to make a thickish sauce, stirring
all the time until bubbles break the surface. Add salt to taste and
continue to cook, stirring, for a few more minutes.

Makes 4 servings.
