MMMMM-----------------------SALAD DRESSING----------------------------
2 tb Dijon mustard
1/2 ts Garlic, chopped
1 ts Salt
1/3 ts White pepper
1 tb Red wine vinegar
5 tb Olive oil, extra virgin
MMMMM-------------------------SALAD MIX------------------------------
1    Head Boston lettuce
1 1/4    Head red tip lettuce
1    Belgian endive
1/2    Head radicchio
In a pan in hot corn oil, deep-fry the wonton skins, one at a time
until crisp, about 15 seconds per side (do not allow oil to smoke).
Set aside. In a bowl, thoroughly mix the goat cheese, cream cheese,
sour cream, chives, parsley, thyme, garlic, and shallots. Season to
taste with the freshly ground pepper. Set aside. TO PREPARE THE
DRESSING: In an electric blender, place the mustard, garlic, salt,
pepper, and vinegar. With blender running, slowly add the olive oil
in a thin, steady stream until mixture is thickened to dressing
consistency. Set aside. TO PREPARE THE LETTUCE: Separate the lettuce
leaves; then tear each leaf into bite-size pieces. In a large bowl,
toss the lettuce and dressing, using just enough of dressing to
evenly coat all the pieces.  Set aside. TO ASSEMBLE THE EACH SALAD:
Spread over one side of each deep-fried wonton skin some of the goat
cheese mixture.  On 4 plates, place a wonton, cheese- side up. Stack
some of the lettuce pieces on the wonton. Top with a second wonton,
cheese-side down. Some of the lettuce will spread out onto the plate.
Garnish each salad with heart of palm slices and cherry/yellow
teardrop tomato halves drizzled with the remaining salad dressing.
Makes 4 salads.
