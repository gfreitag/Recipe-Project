Here's one that I got from Country Woman magazine in the spring of
1989. I have made it so many times for company and it is absolutely
fail-proof and DELICIOUS!! * Or other thick-sliced bread. Combine
eggs, milk, salt and vanilla; mix well. Dip bread slices into egg
mixture; coat both sides with crumbs. Place on well-greased cookie
sheet. Drizzle melted butter over crumb -coated bread.  Bake at 450
for 10 minutes. To make syrup, combine sugar, water, corn syrup and
cinnamon in saucepan. Bring to boil; cook 2 minutes.  Remove from
heat; add milk, flavoring and butter. Serve syrup warm with toast.
Yield: 4 Servings. Serve with Canadian bacon, bacon or sausage as
desired. Note: I always had to double this recipe after the first
time as my family would not stop at 1 1/2 pcs. And they insisted that
I make it when their friends came over. Beverly in NC FROM: BEVERLY
