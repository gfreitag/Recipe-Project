With a variety of canned and packaged foods and a few leftovers in
your refrigerator, you can create a casserole in minutes. Mix and
match one ingredient from each category to suit your taste and
supplies you have on hand.  Choose selections that enhance each other.
Layer all ingredients except topping in a greased 2 quart casserole
dish, adding salt and other seasonings to taste. Bake at 350~ until
hot thorugh for 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle on topping and bake until
slightly browned - another 10 to 15 minutes longer.
