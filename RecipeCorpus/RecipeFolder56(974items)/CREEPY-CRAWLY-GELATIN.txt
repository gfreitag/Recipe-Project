Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Boiling water
1 lg Pkg orange-flavor gelatin
1 1/2 c  Cold water
Gummy worms candy
Stir boiling water into gelatin in large bowl at least 2 minutes until
completely dissolved. Stir in cold water. Pour into pie plate that
has been sprayed with no-stick cooking spray.

Refrigerate about 1-1/2 hours or until thickened (spoon drawn through
leaves definite impression). Push gummy worms into gelatin.
Refrigerate 2 hours or until firm. Unmold.

Helpful hints: Place pie plate on tray before pouring in gelatin to
prevent spilling. Also, when unmolding, dip the pie plate in warm
water for about 15 seconds. Gently pull gelatin from around edges
with moist fingers. Place moistened serving plate on top of pie
plate. Invert pie plate; holding pie plate and plate together, shake
slightly to loosen. Gently remove pie plate and center gelatin on
plate.
