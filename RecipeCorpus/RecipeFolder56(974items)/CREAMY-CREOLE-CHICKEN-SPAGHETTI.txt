Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Boneless chicken breast -- 1
Pound
2    Bell pepper -- chopped
2    Onion -- chopped
4    Stalks celery -- chopped
Salt -- to taste

Cayenne -- to taste
Paul Prudhommes Poultry
Magic -- to taste
1 c  Mushroom -- sliced
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup,
Condensed
4 tb Butter -- melted
8 oz Monterey jack cheese
12 oz Angel hair pasta
Boil 2-3 quarts of water.  Add 1onion, 1 bell pepper, 2 stalks
celery; all coarsly chopped.  Season water with salt, pepper,
cayenne, and prudhommes poultry magic seasoning to taste. Add 4
boneless chicken breast and boil for about 30 minutes or until
chicken is done. Strain and save stock. While chicken is cooking;
Saute 1 bell pepper, 1 onion, and 2 stalks of celery, all finely
chopped in butter until vegatables are soft. When vegetables are
almost done, add 1 cup sliced mushrooms and saute until tender. Add 1
can cream of mushroom soup.  Add cheese to mixture and stir until
melted. Add 1 cup of above chicken stock. Season mixture to taste
with salt, pepper, dash of cayenne and Prudhommes poultry magic
seasoning. Be pretty liberal with the poultry magic.  I add a lot.
Cut chicken into 1 inch cubes and add to mixture.  Can season more,
if needed with the above seasonings. Boil angel hair pasta in chicken
stock and cook according to package directions. Combine pasta with
chicken sauce. Tip: Can use velvetta cheese, or cream cheese. If I
use jalapeno cheese, I use Montery Jack cheese with Jalapeno. DO NOT
USE VELVETTA CHEESE WITH JALEPENO, MAKES IT TOO HOT. The Jalepeno
cheese is just a variation. Source: Charmaine Hebert
