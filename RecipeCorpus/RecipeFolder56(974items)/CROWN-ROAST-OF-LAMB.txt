MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
3    Garlic cloves

1/4 c  Olive oil; -=OR=--

PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Make small incisions in the meaty part of the
lamb every few inches and insert slivers of garlic if using it. Paint
the meat well with olive oil or rub with softened butter. Sprinkle
all over with rosemary and pepper. Crumple a ball of aluminum foil
and stuff in the center. Place on a small rack and surround with the
potatoes in a low roasting pan just large enough to hold it. Place in
the oven and immediately turn the heat down to 400F. Roast until
done, depending upon weight and size, about 30 minutes or until
internal temperature reaches 140F. Remove the foil ball and
immediately salt the meat. Remove to a warmed platter, and let rest
5-to-10 minutes before serving. If waiting longer, cover with foil to
retain heat. To serve, place paper frills on the rib bones and fill
the center with vegetables or stuffing, surround with potatoes and
garnish with watercress or curly parsley. Any sauce would be served
on the side. Makes 6 to 8 Servings
