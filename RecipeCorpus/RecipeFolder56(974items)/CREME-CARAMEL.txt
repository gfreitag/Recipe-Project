"Creme caramel is a great favorite in many restaurants. It is
basically a super rich baked egg custard made with added heavy cream.
It looks small and innocent, but packs a devastating amount of
"shadow energy" (many calories with few nutrients). Our substitutions
are indeed radical ...but they are delicious and reduce the fat
significantly.

Preheat the oven to 300F. In a large saucepan, heat the milk,
rosemary and orange peel until just about to boil. Strain into a
large bowl and stir in the vanilla, egg substitute and sugar. Pour
the custard into 4 individual souffle dishes. Place a 9 inch X 9 inch
baking dish on the oven rack. Place the filled souffle in the dish
and pour in the hot water - the souffle dishes should be about three
quarters submerged. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake
for 1 hour - the custard should be well set. Take the souffle dishes
out of the water and let them cool a bit -a bout 1 hour. To serve:
Loosen the custard from the souffle dish with a knife. Invert the
dish over an individual serving plate and shake the custard out.
Spoon 1 Tsp of the maple syrup over the top. Garnish with a sprig of
rosemary..voila! You can serve Creme Caramel at room temperature or
cold. Serves: 4
