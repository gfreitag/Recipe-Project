Title: CROCKPOT LACQUERED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
2 lb Whole chicken
3 lg Onions -- peeled and
Chopped
5 lg Tomatoes -- chopped
1 md Orange -- unpeeled, seeded,
Ch
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Water
1    Chicken bouillon cube --
Crumbled
3 tb Currant jelly -- red, or
Raspberry
1/4 c  Sweet sherry
In a medium skillet, over medium high heat, heat the oil and saute the
chicken, turning often, until well browned all over. Remove the
chicken to a plate. Saute the onion in the skillet until well
browned. Turn into the crockpot.  Place the tomatoes, orange, sugar,
salt and pepper in the pot and set the chicken on top. Rinse the
skillet with the water and scrape into the cooker. Add the bouillon
cube. Cover and cook on Low for 5 to 7 hours. Before serving, remove
the chicken to a deep serving dish and keep warm. Turn the pot
contents into a skillet, set the heat to high and simmer until thick
enough to mound on a spoon. Stir in the jelly and the sherry and
cook, stirring until the sauce boils. Do not overcook, lest the sauce
lose its shiny quality. If you wish, add some sugar or sweet sherry
to further brighten the taste. If sauce is not shiny enough, bring
back to a very brisk boil and quickly stir in some jelly. Pour sauce
over the chicken.
