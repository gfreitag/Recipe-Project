Title: CROCKPOT MEATBALLS
Categories: Crockpot, Hamburger, Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Jo Ferry
2 lb Hamburger
1 c  Breadcrumbs
1    Egg
Grated parmesan cheese
Parsley and oregano
Onion and garlic powder
Milk
1 cn Beer
1 pk Ketchup; regular size
Mix hamburg, breadcrumbs, egg, seasonings and milk together. Make
small meatballs. Mix ketchup and beer in the crockpot and start to
heat. You can put the raw meatballs into the sauce and simmer for
several hours. I like to bake the meatballs first to get out most of
the grease.
