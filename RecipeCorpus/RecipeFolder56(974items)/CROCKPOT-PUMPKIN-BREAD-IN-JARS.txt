Use only CANNING JARS for this recipe.  Others may not be tempered to
withstand the heat.  Do NOT use coffee or vegetable cans as most
contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that may give
off toxic gases when heated.

This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your
pantry but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:

Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put
on lid and ring and screw on tightly.

Jars will seal as the cake cools.  Store like canned goods.

If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
(about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid or as large as
you'd like) and put it on top of the lid, then screw on the ring.
Make sure you screw the lid on very tightly. I like to use pinking
shears to cut the cloth out with.
