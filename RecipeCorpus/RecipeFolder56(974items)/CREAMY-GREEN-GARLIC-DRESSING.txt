Title: CREAMY GREEN GARLIC DRESSING
Categories: Sauces, Salads, Vegetarian, Dressings
Yield: 1 Servings
8 lg Roasted garlic cloves
- peeled
1/2 c  Minced parsley, packed tight
2 tb Finely chopped shallots
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 oz Silken tofu; mashed
2    -to
3 tb White wine vinegar
1/2 ts Sea salt; or to taste
2 tb -Water, or more as needed
NOTE:  To roast garlic, peel off as much papery skin from each large
head of garlic as will come off easily while still keeping the head
intact. Brush each head liberally with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place in
a small, shallow baking dish in the toaster oven and roast at 375 F
until the outside is lightly browned and the innermost cloves are
soft, about 20 minutes. Refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 2
weeks.

DRESSING:  In a blender or food processor, combine all of the
ingredients and process until smooth, adding water as required to
create a slightly thick consistency.

Use immediately or refrigerate in a tightly sealed container for up
to 1 week.  Bring to room temperature before using and reblend, if
necessary.

Makes 1 cup
