FOR THE QUAIL: In a blender, combine hoisin, soy sauce, oyster sauce,
chile paste, garlic, ginger and wine and pulse to make a smooth
mixture. Whisk together and add quail and toss to coat evenly.
Marinate refrigerated for at least 2 hours.

Add oil to a depth of 1 inch to a deep pan and heat to 350 degrees
(use a thermometer). Combine flour, cayenne, 5 spice and salt
together on a plate. Remove quail from marinade and wipe off excess
marinade. Light coat with flour mixture and deep fry quail in batches
until golden brown and crispy (6-8 minutes). Check at leg joint to
make sure quail is cooked through. Keep quail warm in a low oven and
make sure oil returns to 350 degrees before adding new ones.

Toss the peppers, jicama, scallions and carrots together with 1/3 cup
or so of the vinaigrette and arrange attractively on plates. Top with
a warm quail and serve immediately garnished with cilantro sprigs.
Yield: 6 servings

FOR THE VINIAGRETTE: Saute the shallots in the olive oil until soft
but not brown. Set aside in a mixing bowl to cool. Whisk in the lemon
juice, honey and salt and pepper to taste. Store refrigerated up to 5
days.

Yield: approximately 1 cup
