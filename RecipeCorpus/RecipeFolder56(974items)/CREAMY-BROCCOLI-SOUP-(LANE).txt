CHOPPED MEASURES:  1-1/2 cup onion;  1-3/4 cup potato PREPARE the
broccoli by cutting off and reserving the dark green florets. With a
small, sharp knife, peel the stems lengthwise to reach the tender,
nonfibrous part inside. Discard the peelings and coarsely chop the
tender parts of the stems. Set aside stems and florets. In a large
kettle, heat olive oil over medium-low heat. Add onion and saute for
3 to 4 minutes or until soft. Add garlic and saute 1 minute longer.
Stir in the flour until it coats the onion mixture and cook for 1
minute, stirring constantly. Add the water and bring to a boil over
low heat. Add the potato, broccoli, salt, thyme and white pepper and
simmer covered for 35 minutes. Add the evaporated skim milk and lemon
juice and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes longer. Strain broth and
the vegetables. Puree the vegetables in a food processor or blender;
(or use a hand-held immersion blender). Recombine the pureed
vegetables and the broth and stir well.  Makes 9-1/2 cups.
