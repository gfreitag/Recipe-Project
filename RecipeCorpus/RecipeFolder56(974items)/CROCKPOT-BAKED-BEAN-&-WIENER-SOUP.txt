Title: CROCKPOT BAKED BEAN & WIENER SOUP
Categories: Soups/stews, Crockpot
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1 lb Wieners; sliced diagonally
1    Garlic clove; minced
3 tb Margarine or butter
3 tb Flour
1/4 ts Dry mustard
2 c  Tomato juice
1 c  Water
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1    21 oz can baked beans
Shredded cheddar cheese, if
In large pan saute onion, wieners and garlic in margarine until onion
is tender.  Stir in flour & mustard. Cook 1 minute, stirring
constantly, until smooth & bubbly. Gradually stir in tomato juice,
water, Worcestershire sauce and baked beans; cook until thickened,
stirring constantly. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered 30 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Garnish each serving with cheese. (I also add
a little A-1 sauce sometimes, or use V-8 juice instead of
tomato--whatever's handy!) Enjoy!
