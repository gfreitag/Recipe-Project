Title: CREPES FILLED WITH POACHED PEACHES
Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Hearty red wine
1/2 c  Red raspberry preserves
1    1" x 3" piece of orange zest
1    Cinnamon stick
5    Whole cloves
20 oz Frozen sliced peaches
- (unsweetened)
1 pk Prepared crepes (8-10/pkg)
Warmed vanilla yogurt, opt.
-=OR=- Whipped cream, opt.
IN A SMALL SAUCEPAN, COMBINE the wine, preserves, orange zest,
cinnamon and cloves and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.
Continue cooking until the preserves are melted and the liquid has
thickened, about 6 to 7 minutes. Strain the liquid into a large
skillet, transferring the cinnamon stick to the pan. Add the frozen
peaches to the liquid and over medium-high heat bring the liquid to a
slow boil, carefully separating the frozen slices. This will take
about 3 to 4 minutes. Once the liquid returns to a boil, cook until
the peaches are just warmed through, about 3 minutes. Turn off the
heat and let the peaches cool in the syrup. Place 2 crepes folded in
quarters on each plate. (Leave the extra 2 crepes for seconds.) Spoon
the peaches over the crepes and top with vanilla yogurt or softly
whipped cream, if desired. Serve at once.
