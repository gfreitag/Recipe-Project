Title: CREME DE MENTHE
Categories: Liqueurs
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  80 proof vodka
1 c  Water
3 oz Mint extract
2 c  White sugar
1/2 c  Green mint leaves, washed
Combine the vodka, water, extract of mint, and mint leaves. Cover and
let mixture infuse for 10 days. Strain and add white sugar. Shake
vigorously until the sugar is absorbed. Let stand overnight. If the
green is not deep enough, add green food coloring. If you want clear
creme de menthe, buy clear mint extract and omit the mint leaves.
