stirring often. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Using a
hand-held blender, puree half of the soup. Stir in the parsley.

For the dumplings: In a small mixing bowl, combine the Goat's cheese,

incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the
cheese mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper. Brush the edges
of the wrappers with a little water. Bring two corners of the
wrappers together and seal, forming a triangle. Fry the wontons for
1-2 minutes or until the dumplings are golden and crispy. Remove from
