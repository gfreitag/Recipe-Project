Title: CRUMPETS ANYONE? RECIPE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Package active dry yeast or
1    Cake compressed yeast
1/4 c  Water*
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
3 tb Butter or margarine
1 c  Milk, scalded
1    Egg
3 c  All-purpose flour
Use very warm water (105øF. to 115ø F.) for dry yeast; use lukewarm
(80øF. to 90øF.) for compressed. Sprinkle dry yeast or crumble cake
into water. Let stand for a few minutes; then stir until dis- solved.
Add sugar, salt, and butter to warm milk, stirring to dissolve; cool
to lukewarm. Add egg, yeast mixture, and flour and beat thoroughly.
Let batter rise in warm place for 30 minutes; with spoon, beat for 3
minutes. Repeat rising and beating and then rising again. Pour batter
into greased 4-inch muffin rings on medium hot greased griddle
(325øF. on electric griddle), filling one third full. Bake until well
risen and browned on one side. Turn over, rings and all, and brown on
other side (should take about 18 to 20 minutes). Remove, cool, split,
and toast. Serve with butter and orange mar- malade or jam. Makes 8
to 10. Note: If rings are not available, roll dough to 1/2-inch
thickness on lightly floured board. Cut with floured 4-inch cutter.
Bake 5 minutes on each side. Am I invited for tea? doggie
