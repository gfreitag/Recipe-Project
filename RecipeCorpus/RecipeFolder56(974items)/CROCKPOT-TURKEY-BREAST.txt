Title: CROCKPOT TURKEY BREAST
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Turkey
Chicken broth
Salt and pepper -- to taste
Sage -- to taste
Breast -- frozen
Take frozen turkey breast right out of the freezer........throw it in
the crockpot usually adding a little bit of broth, some salt, pepper,
and sage. If you are not trying to watch your fat content too closely
you can just rub the breast with a thin glaze of butter or margarine
to help the seasonings adhere. Cook on low all day until you get home
and are ready to eat.  The result is turkey so tender it falls right
off the bone!
