Title: CREME BACHIQUE (WHITE WINE CUSTARD WITH HONEY
Categories: Pudding
Yield: 8 Servings
2 1/2 c  White wine; Hermitage or
-other white Rhone wine
3/4 c  Honey
1    Strip lemon zest
1    Cinnamon stick; 2-inch piece
6 lg Eggs
"Made with white wine in place of milk or cream, it tastes like
chilled, spiced wine. It's a refreshing end to a large fall or winter
meal because the flavors are in keeping with the season, and it's
lighter than a traditional custard."

Combine the wine, honey, lemon zest, and cinnamon stick in a medium
saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered,
for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the zest and
cinnamon.

With a whisk, lightly beat the eggs in a medium heatproof bowl. Whisk
in the hot wine mixture, pouring slowly at first in a thin steam, and
then more rapidly. Using a liquid measuring cup divide the mixture
among 8 4-ounce ramekins or 8 Pyrex custard cups. Cover each with a
small square of aluminum foil and press the foil around the rim to
seal.

Set the containers on the steamer rack, place over simmering water,
cover, and steam until the custard is just set but jiggles in the
center when shaken, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then refrigerate
until chilled. Serve very cold.
