1. Combine all filling ingredients together in 2-quart saucepan. Cook
over medium heat, stirring occasionally until mixture comes to a
boil. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Remove from
heat. Cover with plastic wrap; set aside.

2. For topping, combine 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/3 cup flour in
medium bowl; cut in 1/4 cup butter until crumbly. Set aside.

3. Heat oven to 350'F. Stir together flour, baking powder, baking
soda and salt for cake. Set aside. Combine butter and sugar together
in larger mixer bowl of an electric mixer. Beat at medium speed,
scraping bowl often, until creamy, about 1 minute. Add eggs and
vanilla; continue beating until light and fluffy, 1 to
2    minutes.

4. Reduce speed to low. Beat, gradually adding flour alternately with
sour cream to butter mixture, until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes.
Spread batter into greased 12- by 9-inch baking pan.

5. Spoon filling mixture over cake by tablespoons; sprinkle with
topping. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean and
cake is golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool completely. Meanwhile,
stir together all glaze ingredients in small bowl until smooth;
drizzle over cooled cake.

NOTE: The cake will become very high during cooking, but will drop
slightly during cooling. Also, 2 (10- or 11-inch) springform pans can
be used in place of the 13- by 9 inch baking pan.
