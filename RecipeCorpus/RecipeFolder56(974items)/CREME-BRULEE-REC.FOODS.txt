Bring cream to a simmer. In a bowl, whisk together yolks, 1/3 cup
sugar and salt until blended. Slowly whisk in hot cream, then stir in
vanilla extract. Divide mixture into portions (in 6 molds); set them
in a baking pan and pour boiling water to come halfway up the side of
the molds. Bake in preheated 300' oven for 35-40 minutes until set;
don't overbake. Remove from pan, cool, then chill thoroughly. Before
serving, sprinkle 2 tsp. sugar over each custard. Place molds under
broiler for a few seconds until the sugar melts and carmelizes.
