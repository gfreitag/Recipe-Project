Next time I'm confronted with a hollow turkey it gets filled up with
this one. This unusual combination of flavours comes from Argentina.
The original recipe includes fresh peaches but substituting ripe
mango is an improvement.

Melt the butter and cook the onion gently until it is transparent.
Add the minced meat and cook until it changes colour, breaking up
lumps with a fork.  Take off the stove.

Soak the bread in milk, squeeze out and break up.  Mix with the
onion-meat mixture.  Then add the herbs, eggs, olives, peaches,
seasonings and eggs. Blend well.
