Title: CREAMY TOFFEE SAUCE :)
Categories: Ron's, Desserts
Yield: 1 Batch
200 g  Can evaporated milk
Unopened!
Easy to make creamy toffee sauce....

Boil the unopened can of condensed milk for 3 hours remembering to
keep the water in the pan topped up. Leave to cool before using. When
you open the can, you will have a rich creamy home made toffee that
goes so well in other recipes - with ice cream, as a sauce or as a
sweet spread. From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)
