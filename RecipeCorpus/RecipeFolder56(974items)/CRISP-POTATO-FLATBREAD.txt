Title: CRISP POTATO FLATBREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 lg Baking Potato; unpeeled
1/2 c  Milk; heated to 110 degrees
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 ts Sugar
1    Egg
3 tb Butter; softened
1 1/2 c  Bread flour
3 tb Rosemary; chopped
Olive Oil
Coarse Kosher Salt
Preheat the oven to 400d.
:
Prick the potato all over with a fork and bake in the oven for one
hour or until soft.
Remove from the oven, peel and mash the potato until smooth with the
paddle attachment of a heavy duty stand mixer.
Allow to cool.
Meanwhile, in a measuring cup, whisk together the milk, yeast, and
sugar.
Proof the yeast for 10 minutes until very foamy with the egg and
softened butter.
Gradually beat in the flour and the rosemary until smooth. The
mixture will be more like a batter than a dough.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature
until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour.
Stir down with a wooden spoon, cover and refrigerate overnite.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly oil or spray a 13" by 9"
baking sheet. Using oiled hands spread the dough evenly over the
sheet.
Set aside until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Drizzle with a little olive oil and the salt.
Bake for 25 minutes or until golden.
Cut into wedges and serve.
