Title: CROCK POT POT ROAST
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
3 1/2 lb Pot roast (or chuck)
1 lg Onion, chopped
3 lg Carrots, peeled and sliced
16 oz Can diced tomatoes, with
-their juice
I prefer to brown the roast on top of the stove beforehand, although
this is not necessary.  I just brown it on all sides in a little
vegetable oil.

Place the onion and carrots on the bottom of the crock pot (you'll
need at leasta 4 quart crock pot for this recipe). Put the meat on
top and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the tomatoes over
all and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, or on high for 4 to 5 hours.
This is particularly wonderful served with noodles or mashed potatoes
alongside. If you can manage to do the prep work the night before,
it's a good meal for those times when you'll be out all day and
wantto come home to something comforting.  Enjoy!
