To prepare and cook: 1. ea For sweet milky paste, knead butter and
sugar together, then add sifted flour and other ingredients. Steam
mixture over boiling water for approximately 20 minutes until firm.
2. Mix filling ingredients and set aside. 3. Make each dough
separately, kneading their ingredients togeth- er (using water as
necessary to create soft textures). Make small balls (approximately 4
g each) from each dough. 4. Take an outer layer dough ball, slightly
flatten it, and place an inner layer dough ball on top. Roll two
layers together 'into a round shape. Flatten it into a long shape
with a rolling pin.  Roll it up towards you, to form a tube shape.
Place tube sideways on work surface, roll it flat and fold it from
left to right in thirds.  Flatten it again. 5. Place some filling
paste (approximate 1/3 tsp) on flattened dough. Roll it up into a
ball, then flatten half of the ball lightly. Press a knife into
flattened end to make indented lines forming five "fingers", folding
one or two inwards. On back of "hand", draw a few lines across the
surface. At thick end indent a hole with a chopstick. 6. Brush
completed set of "hands" with egg yolk. Bake in an oven at medium
heat for approximately 12 minutes until golden. (The peach garnish
recipe is not included. It is steamed dough with colouring and
decorative leaves and stem.)
