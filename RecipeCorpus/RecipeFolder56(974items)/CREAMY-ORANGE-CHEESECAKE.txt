for garnish, if desired. Press the crust onto the bottom and 2" up
the sides of the springform. Set aside. 2. Puree the cottage cheese,
cream cheese, and sour cream in a food processor until very smooth.
Transfer the cheese mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar,
orange juice concentrate, milk powder, eggs, egg whites, vanilla and
salt and combine thoroughly. Pour the filling into the prepared pan
and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. When it is done, the cake will be

clean and then wet it again before cutting each slice, if necessary.
