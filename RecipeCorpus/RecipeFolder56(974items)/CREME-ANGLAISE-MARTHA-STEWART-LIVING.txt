Title: CREME ANGLAISE-MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Desserts, Soup/stews
Yield: 1 1/2 cup
1 1/4 c  Milk
1    Whole vanilla bean
1/3 c  Sugar
3 lg Egg yolks
1 ts Cornstarch
1 tb Cognac
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring milk and vanilla bean
to a boil. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Remove
vanilla bean.

2. Using an electric mixer, beat together sugar and egg yolks until
thick and fluffy. Add cornstarch. Mix in boiled milk, a little at a
time, on low speed. When mixture is thoroughly blended, transfer to a
heavy enameled saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring slowly and
constantly with a wooden spoon. Continue stirring, without letting
sauce boil, until sauce thickens to a creamy consistency and surface
froth has subsided.

3. Remove mixture from heat and whisk in cognac. Strain through a fine
sieve and cool. Refrigerate in a covered container until ready to
use, up to 2 days.
