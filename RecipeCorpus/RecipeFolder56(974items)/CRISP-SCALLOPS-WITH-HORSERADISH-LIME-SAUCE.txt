2 tb Bottled horseradish --
Drained
1 1/2 ts Fresh lime juice
1/2 ts Lime zest -- freshly grated
1/8 ts Black pepper -- freshly

6    5-by 2 1/2" graham crackers

FOR SAUCE:

In a bowl, whisk together mayonaise, horseradish, lime juice, zest,
and pepper.  Cover and chill.

FOR SCALLOPS:

Put graham crackers in a resealable plastic bag and with a rolling pin
lightly crush until crumbs are course. In a bowl, stir together
crumbs and salt. Discard small tough muscle from side of each scallop
and halve any large scallops.  Pat scallops dry.

In a 4-quart heavy saucepan or heavy kettle, heat 1 1/2 inches oil to
365 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer. Working in batches of 6, dip
scallops in egg to coat, letting excess drip off, and roll in crumb
mixture. Fry scallops, stirring gently, 2 minutes, or until browned
and cooked through. Transfer scallops as cooked with a slotted spoon
to paper towels to drain and season with salt and pepper.

Serve scallops on a platter with sauce.

Makes about 24 hors d'oeuvres or 2-3 main course servings.
