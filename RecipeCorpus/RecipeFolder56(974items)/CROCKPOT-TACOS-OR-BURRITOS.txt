Leave meat in whole pieces; you may even put it in frozen. In the
morning, put the meat into the crockpot, add taco seasoning mix, and
water. Plug it in and turn it on simmer according to manufacturer's

If you have time in the morning, shred the cheese and lettuce and
chop the tomatoes and store in ziplock or Rubbermaid containers in
the refrigerator.

When meat is cooked, remove with slotted spoon to a platter and allow
to cool enough to handle.  Place chicken breasts or beef on cutting
board, and using a fork, shred the meat, while discarding any pieces
of fat, etc, that you find.  Return shredded meat to crockpot. Warm
refried beans in small sauce pan or microwave. Wrap tortillas in foil
and warm in the oven. Put remaining ingredients out in dishes on
table (or counter) and holler "DINNER!!!" very loudly. The diners can
put together their own soft tacos or burritos with the ingredients
they like best.
