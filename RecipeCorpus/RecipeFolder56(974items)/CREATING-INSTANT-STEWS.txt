Selecting the trimmest, fastest-cooking ingredients is the basis for
instant stews. But the key to creating such a stew is in the assembly
of those ingredients.
There are five simple steps to cooking an instant stew in your home
kitchen: Step 1. In a soup pot, bring broth to a boil over medium-high
heat. Step 2.  Add tender, lean, skinless poultry or fish that's been
cut into small pieces. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer
for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and reserve the meat. Step 3.  Add hard,
long-cooking fresh foods like potatoes, carrots or winter squash and
dried foods like lentils, uncooked white rice and grains, as well as
any dried herbs or spices. Stir, cover and simmer for 5 to 10
minutes. Step4. Add dried food, such as various kinds of pasta and
quick rice (which have shorter cooking times that those mentioned in
Step 3), canned beans, frozen vegetables, tender fresh vegetables and
aromatics like garlic or onions. Bring to a boil. Stir, cover and
cook for 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 5.  Return cooked poultry or fish to the pot. Add fresh snipped
herbs, fresh pasta or fresh greens, like spinach or kale. Stir, cover
and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve the stew immediately.
