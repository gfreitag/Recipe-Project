MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
2 tb Reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tb Rice-wine vinegar
1 tb Scallions; chopped
1 ts Honey
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Lightly oil a wire rack large enough
to hold scallops in a single layer. Put the rack on a baking sheet
and set aside.

In a bowl, whisk together egg white, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and
soy sauce until creamy.  In a shallow dish, stir together
breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, and ginger.

Add the scallops to the egg-white mixture, tossing to coat them well.
Transfer the scallops to the breadcrumb mixture in two or three
batches, tossing each with a spoon to coat evenly. Place the scallops
on the prepared rack; they should not touch each other. Bake for 8-10
minutes or until the outsides are golden and the centers are opaque.

To Make Dipping Sauce:  In a small bowl, stir together the sauce
ingredients.  Serve alongside the hot scallops. Serves 4
