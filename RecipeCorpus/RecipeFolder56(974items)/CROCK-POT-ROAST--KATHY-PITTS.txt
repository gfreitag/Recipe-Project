Title: CROCK POT ROAST--KATHY PITTS
Categories: Crockpot
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Fairly lean pot roast
1 pk Dehydrated onion soup mix
1    Onion, thinly sliced
Place half the onion in bottom of roast.  Rub the roast with the soup
mix. Place roast in pot, and top with remaining onion. Cover and cook
on low heat for at least 12 hours. Do not panic and add water--it
will make its own juices.

You can add carrots or potatoes to the roast.  Just be sure to place
veggies in the bottom, so they will absorb the juices. Posted on
