Title: CREAMY CHICKEN GRAVY
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 8 Servings
2 tb Pan Dripping from roasted
Chicken, or unsalted butter
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1/4 c  Finely chopped celery
4 tb All-purpose flour
4 c  Chicken stock
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  Lowfat or skim milk
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper*
1.  In a medium-size sauce-pan heat the drippings over moderate heat.
Add the onion and celery and saute, stirring occaisionally, for five
munutes or until the vegetables are tender. Lower the heat, stir in
the flour and cook, stirring, 3 minutes more or until golden and
bubbling. (Watch it doesn't get to hot...this is the critical stage.)
Add the stock and bay leaf, return to a boild, then lower the heat
and simmer, sitrring frequently, for 10 minutes. Add the milk, salt,
and pepper and simmer for about 2 minutes or until heated through.
Remove the bay leaf. Makes a scant more than 8- half cup servings.
*Spice note: I like to use course ground black pepper (or restaurant
grind) in order to give the appearance of "Country Gravy" especially
when serving fried chicken and mashed potatoes, or with biscuits for
breakfast. Other times I use white pepper, for flavor without
appearance. Use your imagination and your preferences.
