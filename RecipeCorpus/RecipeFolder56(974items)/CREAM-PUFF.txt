Title: CREAM PUFF
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Hot water
1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Butter -- room temperature
1 c  Flour
4 lg Eggs
Boil water, salt, butter. Add flour, all at once. Lower heat and beat
with wooden spoon for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove to mixer bowl and rest
(cool) for about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time and beat one
minute after each addition. Then beat on medium speed for 3 minutes
to incorporate air into mixture. Refrigerate the dough covered for
one hour. It should be good and cold. Preheat the oven for 15 or more
minutes to 450F Use parchment paper on jelly roll pan and ice cream
scoop to get nice size puffs on sheet. Six puffs is probably all it
will hold. Bake at 450F for 15 minutes and then reduce heat to 350F
and bake for 30 minutes. DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR during this period. As
soon as the final 30 minutes is up. Turn the oven off and open the
oven door leaving the jelly roll/puffs in the oven to cool for one
hour.
