Some of the best garlic recipes come right from Gilroy. Here's one-a
rich, filling soup that would go well with a light seafood or poultry
entree.

Place garlic heads on cookie sheet, sprinkle with olive oil and bake
in 350-degree oven for 1 hour. Let cool. Cut off end of each clove
and squeeze out contents. (Garlic will be soft and creamy.) Set
aside. Saute chopped onion in butter until softened. Add buttermilk
and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a food
processor. Rice potato and add with garlic to onion and buttermilk
mixture. Puree until smooth. Return mixture to saute pan. Add cognac,
dill and salt. Heat thoroughly. If soup is too thin, add additional
potato. If soup is too thick, add addi- tional buttermilk. Serve
immediately, garnished with additional dill and croutons. Makes 4
servings.
