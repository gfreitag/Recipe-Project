Mushroom soup is so readily available in cans that it seldom occurs
to the cook to make it from scratch. The canned product is, in fact,
so universal, reliable, and chameleon-like in flavor that it has
become the base of a thousand casseroles.
If you seek a more intense mushroom flavor, however, look no further.
Erid Lie, tooting his own horn, claims to have the answer to your
prayers right here.
Flour plays a part in the thickening of this soup, but the basic body
and emphatic statement of mushroom flavor come from cooking part of
the mushrooms with onions until they are mellow and lightly browned,
then pureeing them.
The flavor is further enhanced by adding sliced mushrooms before the
final heating.
=======================================================
============== ===
1. Chop half the mushrooms; thinly slice the remaining mushrooms and
set aside.
2. Melt butter in a 5-6 quart pan over medium-high heat; add chopped
mushrooms, onion, and thyme. Stir often until the vegetables are
lightly browned, 15-20 minutes. Mix flour with vegetables.
3. Pour into a blender or food processor; whirl, adding as much broth
as needed to get the mixture smoothly pureed. Pour mixture back into
pan; add remaining broth, sliced mushrooms, bay leaf, and cream.
4. Bring soup to a boil on high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce
heat to low and simmer to blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Add
sherry, salt, and pepper to taste. Make about 8 cups.
