Title: SOUR CREAM BELGIAN WAFFLES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
2    Eggs
1 c  Sour cream
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Milk
1/4 c  Margarine, melted
Note:  The secret to light and crispy Belgian waffles is folding in
the egg whites.  Throwing them in with the egg yolks will work, but
you'll get a heavier waffle.

Separate the eggs and place egg yolks in one bowl, and the whites in
another.  To the egg yolks, add the sour cream, milk, margarine and
vanilla;  Mix well.  Add the flour, sugar and baking powder; mix well.

With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff. Fold into the
batter with a spoon.

Bake on a hot waffle iron.  Serve with maple syrup.
