Title: SHORT RIBS BRAISED IN RED WINE *JB
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Short ribs (about 6 pounds)
2 tb Coarse salt
1/2 ts Fresh-ground black pepper
1 tb Olive oil
1    Onion, chopped
1    Carrot, chopped
1    Rib celery, chopped
1 1/4 c  Water
2 c  Red wine
1. Trim any excess fat from the ribs. Sprinkle each rib on all sides,
except the bone-side, with 1 teaspoon of the salt. Put the ribs on a
rack atop a baking sheet to catch any drips. Cover with plastic wrap
and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.

2. Heat the oven to 325 B0. Dry the ribs with paper towels and then
sprinkle them with the ground pepper. In a large pot, heat the oil
over moderately high heat. Add three of the ribs and brown them well
on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove the ribs. Brown the remaining
ribs and remove them from the pot.

3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pot. Reduce the heat
to moderately low. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the
water and simmer 2 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot to
dislodge any brown bits.

4. Transfer the vegetables and liquid to a roasting pan. Arrange the
ribs, side by side, on top of the vegetables and add any accumulated
juice. Pour the wine over the ribs. Cover tightly with aluminum foil
and cook in the oven until tender but not falling off the bone, about
2 hours and 20 minutes.

5. Remove the ribs and keep warm. Pour off most of the fat from the
roasting pan. Strain the braising liquid into a medium saucepan and
press the vegetables to get all the liquid. Discard the vegetables.
Bring to a boil over moderately high heat and continue boiling until
the liquid is reduced to 2-1/2 cups, about 5 minutes. Serve the ribs
with the jus poured over them.
