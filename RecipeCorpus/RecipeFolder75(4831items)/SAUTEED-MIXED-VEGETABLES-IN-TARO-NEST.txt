Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Vegetable SAUTEED
MIXED VEGETABLES IN TARO NEST (12 servings)

Chef: Lam Sing-lun (Hotel Furama Inter-Continental) "Fragrant
Surroundings Pond" conveys images of rural peace and petite elegance,
both enhanced further by the rhyming sounds of the Chinese
characters. A traditional dish, sauteed mixed vegetables, is
presented innovatively.

1.  For taro nest , cut taro length ways into thin (3 mm) slices. Cut
two-thirds of slices into thins strips (for edge of basket). Cut
remaining one-third into strips 1.5 cms wide (for base of basket).
Marinate with salt for 1 hour.  Then rinse under cold running water
for 3 hours. Drain and mix with cornstarch. Form woven basket on
inside of one mold. Lay second mold on top.  Deep-fry mould-framed
taro over low flame. 2. Slice each mushroom into four.  Halve each
fungus. Remove snow pea strings. Cut celery diagonally.  Cut carrot
into patterned pieces. 3. Mix sauce ingredients well. 4. For garnish
(optional): Slice black mushrooms. Peel tomatoes, remove seeds and
cut each into 4 slices. Cut baby corns and mustard green stems in
half.  Drain black fungi. To cook 1. Bring garnish seasoning
ingredients to the boil, add mustard green stems and black mushrooms
for 1 minute. Add remaining garnish ingredients and bring to the boil
again for another minute.  Drain and trim. 2. Bring seasoning
ingredients to the boil, add all "sauteed vegetables" ingredients
except snow peas and cook for 1 minute.  Remove vegetables. 3. Blanch
snow peas in boiling oil for 1 minute, and remove when crisp. Pour
excess oil out of wok. 4. Add sauce and all "sauteed vegetables".
