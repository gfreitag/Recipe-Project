This recipe for pretzels uses traditional Irish soda bread dought
instead of a yeast based dough. It's quick and works great! The
pretzels come out excellent--like the street vendor type.  I hope you
enjoy...

Combine water and soda in a non-aluminum pot (Corning works well).
Heat to a boil or until all soda dissolves. Take off heat and set
aside. This will be your dipping solution.

Preheat oven to 400 deg F Sift flours and soda together and mix
homogeneously. Add honey and slowly add buttermilk while working with
hands until it is a firm dough. With a pin, roll dought into a flat
sheet. Cut dough in long strips to make large pretzel twists, or cut
into bite sized pieces (like I do!). Dip the prepared pieces of dough
completely into the dipping solution. This will create the brown
crunchy pretzel shell. Once dipped, place on an oven rack (if bite
sized pieces are being made, cover the rack with aluminum foil and
spray with PAM). Sprinkle with course salt if desired.

Cook for 10 minutes of until dark brown on the second oven rack from
the bottom.

This method works great.  Pretzels are basically regular bread dough
dipped in a baking soda solution before baking. The advantage to this
method is that soda bread, a quick bread, has no yeast and does not
require the time needed for rising before cooking. As soon as the
dought is made, it is ready for the oven! Walt MM
