Though it's been around a long time, there's something almost
quintessentially American about the sandwich. It's casual,
convenient, and incredibly adaptable, equally at home in the
lunchbox, the all night diner, and the hors d'oeuvres tray.
Chances are we'd be enjoying sandwiches today even if the gambling
table hadn't been invented, but they wouldn't be called sandwiches.
After all it was the gambling table that prompted the fourth Earl of
Sandwich ( 1718-1792 ) to have his food served to him between two
slices of bread so he wouldn't have to interrupt his gaming to eat.
Actually though people were  munching on various foods stuffed
between slabs of bread long before the earl came into the picture.
I've tried to get a good range of different types of sandwiches,
different fillings, salads and garnishes, as well as I hope, some
useful information.
So please sit back and enjoy, and I'll start posting some of what I
have found in the way of " Sandwich Stuff."
