My dad did that for as long as I can remember.  Scott takes the idea
one step farther, letting meat juice drip in. With Scott's method,
you'll probably want to refrigerate it so the fat will harden and be
easy to remove.

What I do is make my sauce, but keep it a little on the thin side. I
pour it into a pyrex dish, and set it off to the side on the smoker
for the last few hours. You'll get a blackish film that forms on the
surface. Just stir that in every half your or so, until you get the
flavor you want. Much better than using liquid smoke.
