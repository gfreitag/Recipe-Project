For elegance and drama, borrow the Sazerac tradition of serving
colorful sorbets in a glistening swan ice sculpture. The ice mold,
which is truly impressive, is easy to create with a soft-plastic mold
filled with distilled water and frozen overnight. The next day,
simply pull off the plastic. Info on ordering the mold included at
end of recipe.

DIRECTIONS: If using ice swan, prepare several days in advance. Fill
mold with distilled water. Freeze until firm throughout. Remove from
mold and return to freezer until ready to use.

To make Lemon Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat water and sugar to
boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
temperature. Stir in mineral water, lemon juice, and rind. Gently
fold in egg white. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).

To make Strawberry Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat sugar and water
to boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
temperature. In food processor, with chopping blade, puree
strawberries, a cup at a time. Strain juice and pulp into bowl;
discard seeds. Stir strawberry puree and orange and lemon juices into
sugar mixture. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).

To make Blackberry Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat sugar and water
to boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
temperature. In food processor, with chopping blade, puree
blackberries, a cup at a time. Strain juice and pulp into bowl;
discard seeds. Gently fold blackberry puree and egg whites into sugar
mixture. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).

Just before serving, place swan on cloth napkin lined serving platter
and garnish with mint and flowers, if desired. Scoop sorbets into
swan or a glass bowl and serve immediately.

Freezing Directions: If using ice cream maker, freeze sorbet mixture
following manufacturer's directions. If not using an ice cream maker,
pour sorbet mixture into 13 by 9 inch baking pan; cover and freeze 6
to 8 hours or until frozen. Remove sorbet from freezer; cut into 1
inch squares and let stand at room temperature 20 minutes or until
slightly softened. Meanwhile, chill large bowl and beaters of
electric mixer. Place softened sorbet squares in chilled bowl. Beat
on low speed until squares are broken up, then beat on high speed
until smooth and fluffy- about 1 minute. Pack sorbet into a freezer
container and freeze until ready to serve.
