Yield: 48 Servings
1 lb Unsalted butter
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Condensed milk
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Cornstarch
COMBINE BUTTER, sugar and salt in an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle, if you have one, and beat at medium speed until creamy. Add
condensed milk and vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed
to slow and slowly add the flour and then the cornstarch. Beat until
incorporated. Divide the dough unto 4 balls, wrap in plastic wrap and
chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or until firm. Lightly flour a
work surface and roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness. Keep
lifting the dough and, if it sticks to the surface, sprinkle with a
little more flour. Preheat oven to 300F. Using a 2 1/2-inch round
cookie cutter, cut out circles of dough, or use a knife to cut dough
into 2-inch squares. Place on a non-stick or lightly buttered cookie
sheet, and replace in the refrigerator to chill, about 15 minutes.
Place rack in the middle of the oven. Place cookies in the oven for
15 to 20 minutes. The cookies should color only slightly. Cool
completely.
