Cut beef into 1/2-inch strips, put in a plastic bag with 3
tablespoons of flour and the salt. Shake until the meat is evenly
coated. In a heavy skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil/shortening, add
the meat strips and brown slowly, stirring often. Add onion, garlic,
Coca-Cola, and 1/4 cup of water, mix well. Cover and simmer 30 to 45
minutes or until the meat is fork-tender. In a bowl, mix the 2
tablespoons of flour with the 1/2 cup of water until smooth. Stir
into the meat along with the Worcestershire sauce and the undrained
mushrooms. Stir and cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. (If making

then complete the recipe directions.) Stir in the sour cream and heat
gently just until the gravy simmers. Sprinkle with parsley and serve
over potatoes, noodles, or rice. Makes 6 servings or 3 cups.
