minutes. Add salmon and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat and
simmer, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily
with fork. Remove from heat and let salmon cool in liquid. Strain
poaching liquid and reserve. Mousse: When salmon has cooled, remove
skin and all bones carefully. Break fish into small pieces and add
1/2 cup of reserved stock. In a small bowl, soften gelatin in lemon
juice. In saucepan, bring 1 cup reserved stock to boil. Add gelatin
mixture and stir until dissolved. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl,
combine salmon, gelatin mixture, mayonnaise, sour sour cream, nutmeg,
salt and pepper. Mix together gently but thoroughly. Beat cream until
stiff and fold gently into salmon mixture. Oil a six-cup- capacity
mold and carefully spoon in mousse. Cover and refrigerate until set.
Cucumber Sauce: Grate peeled, seeded cucumbers into bowl. Add
remaining ingredients and mix well. Refrigerate until serving time.
To serve, invert mousse onto tray, garnish with dill and lemon
wedges. Serve with Cucumber sauce. From Martha Stewart Entertaining.
