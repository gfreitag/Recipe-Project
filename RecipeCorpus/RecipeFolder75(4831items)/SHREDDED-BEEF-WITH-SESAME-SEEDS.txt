Categories: Meats, Oriental
Yield: 4 Servings

1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Cornstarch
2/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
1 tb White sesame seeds

1 ts Sugar
2 ts Rice wine or dry sherry
1/2 ts Roasted Sichuan peppercorns

CUT THE STEAK INTO FINE SHREDS 3 inches long. Combine them with the
egg white, salt and cornstarch, and chill for about 20 minutes. Heat
the oil in a wok or large skillet until it is moderately hot. Add the
beef mixture and stir-fry it quickly in the oil to keep it from
sticking. Cook until it turns white, which should take about 1
minute. Drain the beef immediately in a colander or sieve and drain
off the oil. Clean the wok and add about 1 tablespoon of the drained
oil. Reheat it until it is hot. Add the sesame seeds and stir-fry
them for 1 minute or until they are slightly brown. Add the sauce
ingredients and bring to a boil. Return the cooked beef to the pan
and stir-fry the mixture for another 2 minutes, coating the pieces
thoroughly with the sauce and sesame seeds. Serve at once, or let it
cool and serve at room temperature.
