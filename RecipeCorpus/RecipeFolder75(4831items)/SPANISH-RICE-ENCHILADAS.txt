Title: SPANISH-RICE ENCHILADAS
Categories: Mcdougall, Fat-free, Mexican
Yield: 1012 Servings
1/4 c  Water
1    Onion, chopped
2 c  Fresh spinach, chopped
3 c  Cooked brown rice
1 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Ground cumin
5 or 6 c  Enchilada sauce 10 or 12 Soft corn tortillas

1. Place water and onion in a medium saucepan.  Saute
until onion softens slightly.
2. Add the spinach.  Cover and steam until just
tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Remove from heat.  Add rice and seasonings.  Mix
and set aside.
(I would probably use a little wine, Bragg's
Amino, and/or some veggie broth instead of the
water for sauteing.) 4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
5. Spread 1 cup of Enchilada sauce over the bottom of
a casserole dish.
6. Spread a line of the spinach-rice mixtue down the
center of a tortilla.
7. Roll up and place, seam-side down, in the
casserole.
8. Repeat until all of the ingredients are used.
9. Pour the remaining sauce over the tortillas. 10. Cover and bake
for 30 minutes.
(Anyone NOT following the McDougall Plan, could
top this off with some
no-fat cheddar cheese and/or serve with a bit of
no-fat sour cream.
