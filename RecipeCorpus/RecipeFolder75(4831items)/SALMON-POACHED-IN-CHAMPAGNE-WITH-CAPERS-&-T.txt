Categories: Fish, Low-fat, Low-cal
Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 1/4 lb Salmon fillets
2 c  Champagne
1/4 c  Fresh-squeezed lemon juice
1/2 md Yellow onion; sliced
1 tb Capers
4    5-inch sprigs fresh tarragon
Several grinds of pepper
Rinse the fillets and place in a shallow pan large enough to hold
them in one layer.  Add the champagne, lemon juice, and enough water
to just cover the fillets. Remove the fish and bring poaching liquid
to a boil. Lay the fish back in the pan in a single layer and top
with the onion slices, capers, tarragon, and pepper. Reduce heat to
low, cover, and simmer 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the thickness of
the fish. Fish is done when mostly opaque but still barely
transparent at the very center. Remove fish from the liquid, along
with onions, capers, and tarragon. Drain well and serve immediately
on warmed plates. This is nice with a wild rice pilaf and a tossed
green salad.
