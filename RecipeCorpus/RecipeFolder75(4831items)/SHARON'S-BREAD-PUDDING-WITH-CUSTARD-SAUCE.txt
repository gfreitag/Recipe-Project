Categories: Inn recipes, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
6    Eggs
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Cinnamon
1 tb Nutmeg
1 tb Vanilla
1/2 c  Melted butter
3 c  Milk
1 c  Evaporated milk
1    French bread loaf
Torn into 1-inch pieces
1 c  Chopped pecans
1 c  Raisins; (optional)
Sauce:
4 lg Eggs
4 lg Egg yolks
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
2 c  Milk
1 c  Evaporated milk
2 ts Vanilla
2 tb Dark rum or amaretto
Whip eggs until foamy. Add sugar, spices, vanilla, and melted butter;
mix well. Add milk and torn pieces of French bread. Mix until all
bread is saturated. Add pecans and raisins, if using. Pour into
greased 9 x 13 inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. While
bread is in oven, make custard sauce. Beat eggs and egg yolks
together until light and creamy. Beat in sugar, cornstarch, milk and
evaporated milk. Microwave at high for 2 minutes. Whip with wire
whisk. Continue cooking at high until mixture is very thick, stirring
with wire whisk every 30 to 60 seconds. (If you overcook, custard
will have unsightly little bumps, blend in food processor or blender
until smooth.)Remove from microwave and whisk in vanilla and amaretto
or rum. Spoon over hot bread mixture in attractive bowls or glasses.
Serve warm. If making ahead, refrigerate both bread and custard.
Re-warm both in microwave.JM. Victorian Oaks Bed & Breakfast Minonk,
