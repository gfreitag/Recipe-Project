Title: SODA BREAD (QUICK) (CALLERY)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Sugar (optional)
2 c  Buttermilk
Mix dry ingredients.  Add enough buttermilk to make a soft dough.
Knead the dough lightly.  Form a round loaf about as thick as your
fist. Place it on a lightly-floured baking sheet and cut a cross in
the top with a floured knife.  Bake near the top of a preheated 450
degree oven for 30-45 minutes.

The first recipe is adapted from one I found years ago in the
newspaper. The second recipe is from "A Little Irish Cookbook" by
John Murphy Chronicle Books, 1986 (ISBN: 0-87701-400-0)
