Title: SOPA DE ENTULHO (RUBBLE SOUP)
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Dry red beans
1 lg Onion
2    Cloves
2    Turnips
3    Carrots
3 md Potatoes
4 pt Water
1 sl Pumpkin
4 oz Unsmoked bacon -OR-
4 ts Olive oil
1/2    White Cabbage
Wine vinegar
Salt
Soak the beans for a few hours; fill a large pan with 4 pt cold water,
press the cloves into the onion, as if their were pins, and add to
the pan with the beans. (resist the temptation to use canned beans;
it's worth the extra trouble). Add the bacon cut into small pieces.
When the beans are tender add the turnip cut into small cubes, the
carrots sliced thinly and the pumpkin slice cut into large cubes.
Discard the onion. When the carrots are almost cooked add the potato,
peeled and cut into small cubes, the washed leaves of the turnip
broken into medium size pieces by hand, and the leaves of the cabbage
hand-shred into large pieces. Let everything cook together for a
while, until soft. Place a teaspoon of vinegar in each bowl, and fill
with the hot soup. Some soup lovers will add a dash of piri-piri
sauce, or of Tabasco. The soup will taste even better if you boil a
ham bone with the beans. If there is any meat left in the bone shred
it and add to the soup. Discard the bone. (How obvious can I get?) <G>
