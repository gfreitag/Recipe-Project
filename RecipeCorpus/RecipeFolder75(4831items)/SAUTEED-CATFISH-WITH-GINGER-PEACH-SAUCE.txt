Title: SAUTEED CATFISH WITH GINGER PEACH SAUCE
Categories: Seafood, Sauces, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM---------------------GINGER PEACH SAUCE--------------------------
1 tb Butter
1/2 ts Ginger, ground
16 oz Peaches, sliced; drained
1 c  Fruit spread, peach
1 tb Catsup
1 tb Vinegar, white wine
MMMMM--------------------------CATFISH-------------------------------
1/2 c  Flour
1 tb Thyme leaves; crumbled
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper, black
1 1/2 lb Catfish fillets
2 tb Oil
1 tb Butter
1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
You may use 1-1/2 c peeled sliced fresh peaches instead of the canned
peaches.

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; add ginger and stir
1 minute. If using fresh peaches, add and cook, stirring
occasionally, until peaches are fork tender, about 2 minutes. Add
canned peaches, if using, and preserves; stir until jam melts. Stir
in catsup, vinegar and hot pepper sauce. Transfer mixture to a
blender or food processor and whirl until peaches are coarsely
chopped. (Sauce can be cooled and refrigerated up to 2 weeks) To
serve, warm sauce, stirring, in a sauce pan over medium heat.

Makes about 2 cups.

In a medium size bowl or pie plate, combine flour, thyme, salt and
pepper. Rinse fish and pat dry. Dredge fish in flour mixture; shake
off excess and lay fillets in a single layer on a plate. In a 10 to
12 inch frying pan over medium heat, heat oil and butter; add pecans
and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer nuts to paper
towels to drain. Add fish to pan, without overlapping (you may need
to cook in 2 batches) Cook until fish is crisp and golden on bottom,
about 4 minutes; turn fillets over and cook until fish is opaque and
tender in center of thickest area, another 4 minutes. Transfer fish
briefly to paper towels to drain then arrange on plates. Spoon about
3 Tablespoons warm Ginger Peach Sauce over each serving; sprinkle
with pecans.

Makes 4 servings.

Ginger Peach Sauce is a nice counterpoint to the savory crispness of
the fish. Keep some around to try with fried catfish, fried oysters
or grilled shrimp.
