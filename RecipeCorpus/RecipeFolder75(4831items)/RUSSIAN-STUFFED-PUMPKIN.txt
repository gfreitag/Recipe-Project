This spectacular stuffed pumpkin can be the centerpiece of your
Thanksgiving table.  Pumpkin is stuffed with rice, apples, raisins
and sour cherries, then baked.

Cut the stem end of the pumpkin as if you were about to carve a jack
o'lantern.  Set aside "lid".  Remove insides of pumpkin and discard
(or save to roast and munch on). Using a grapefruit knife or melon
baller, scoop out the flesh of the pumpkin as much as you can without
piercing the skin.  Chop flesh and set aside.

In lg saucepan, bring 3 qts of salted water to boil and dump in the
rice. Cook over high heat, covered until still a bit hard to the
bite...about 15 minutes. Drain well.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In large bowl, combine, pumpkin, partially cooked rice, raisins,
dried sour cherries and melted butter. Season with sugar, salt and
cinamon. Spoon stuffing loosely into pumpkin, sprinkle with the hot
water and put "lid" on tightly.  Place on baking sheet and bake till
pumpkin is tender to a point of a knife...about 2 hrs. Cut into
wedges and serve.
