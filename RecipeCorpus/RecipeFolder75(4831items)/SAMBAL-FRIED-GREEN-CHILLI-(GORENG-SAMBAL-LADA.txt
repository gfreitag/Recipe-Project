Title: SAMBAL FRIED GREEN CHILLI (GORENG SAMBAL LADA
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1/4 lb Green chillies
2    Onions, thinly sliced
1/4 c  Oil
Salt, to taste
2    Green tomatoes, diced
1    Tin anchovy fillets in olive
-oil, chopped
Pound chilli into paste in a mortar or put in a blender with 2
tablespoons of water and switch on for 20 seconds on medium speed.
Stir-fry onions in hot oil until golden. Add chilli and salt, stir
and reduce heat. Let simmer for 2 minutes. Add diced tomatoes,
chopped anchovies, oil and all. Stir and let simmer very gently for
15 minutes. Stir occasionally. This long cooking removes the bite of
the chilli and blends all the flavours together. The same recipe can
be prepared using red chilli instead of green chilli and ripe
tomatoes instead of green ones. This sambal will keep for a week if
put in the refrigerator.
