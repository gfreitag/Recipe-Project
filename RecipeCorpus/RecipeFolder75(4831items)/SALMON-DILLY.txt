Title: SALMON DILLY
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Salmon fillet or steak
1/2 c  Half-and-half or milk (or
-less)
1/2 ts Minced fresh dill, chopped
-chives, or basil
-Salt (optional)
This is the easiest way I know to cook tender and delicate salmon.
It's especially good prepared with fresh dillQbut if you prefer
chives or basil, it's still a delightful dish.

Preheat oven to 350!F. Place salmon in shallow baking dish and add
half and-half or milk so fish is half immersed. Sprinkle with dill,
chives or basil, and salt if desired. Bake 30 minutes, occasionally
spooning some of the half-and-half or milk over salmon. Check for
doneness; when fish is predominately pale pink but is still a
somewhat darker pink in center, it's done.

Makes one serving.
