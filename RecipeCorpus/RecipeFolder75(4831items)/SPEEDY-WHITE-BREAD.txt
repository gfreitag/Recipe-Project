6 c  All purpose flour
3 tb Sugar
2 1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Active dry yeast
2 1/4 c  Water (120-130 F)
3 tb Margarine or butter

until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. Stir in an
additional 2-1/2 to 3 cups flour until dough pulls cleanly away from
sides of bowl.
On a floured surface, knead in 1/2 to 1 cup flour until dough is
smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl;
cover loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel. Place bowl in pan of
warm water (about 95 F); let rise 15 minutes. Or if using rapid
yeast, let bowl stand in a warm place for
15    minutes.
Grease cookie sheet. Punch down dough several times to remove all air
bubbles. Divide dough into 2 parts; shape into round balls. PLace on
greased cookie sheet. With a sharp knife, slash 1/4-inch deep lattice
design on top of each loaf. Cover; let rise in warm place 15 minutes.
Heat oven to 400 F. Uncover dough. Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until
loaves sound hollow when lightly tapped. Immediately remove from
cookie sheet; cool on wire racks.
