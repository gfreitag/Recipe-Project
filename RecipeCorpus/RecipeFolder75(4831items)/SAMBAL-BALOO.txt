(Thai Dragon is a small very hot chile pepper from Thailand.)  Remove
stems from the peppers and peel the garlic cloves. Put all
ingredients in a food processor (using the steel blade) and mix 3 - 4
minutes. Boil 10 minutes and put in sterilised jars.  This makes a
sambal that is much hotter than the usual Sambal Olek you can find in
Asian stores.  Use it when making hot Oriental food.

Wash your hands with 80% alcohol after you handled the peppers! Don't
touch your eyes or your private parts before you have washed your
hands with alcohol! It will burn for hours.
