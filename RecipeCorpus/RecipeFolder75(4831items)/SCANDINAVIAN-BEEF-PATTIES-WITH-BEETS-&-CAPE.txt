1    Small onion; minced
1 lb Ground sirloin
1    Egg yolk
1/2 c  Finely chopped pickled beets

In a large saucepan of boiling salted water, cook potato until tender

peel, and mash with heavy cream, and cloves plus salt and pepper to
taste. In a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat.
Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes.
Stir into mashed potato. Add ground sirloin and egg yolk to potato

patties about 1-inch thick. Transfer patties to wax-paper-lined
baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour. Dredge
patties in flour; shake off excess. In a large skillet, melt
remaining butter in oil over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook
until bottoms are browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until
desired doneness, about 5 minutes for medium. Source: 365 Ways To

patties with whipped mashed potatoes and a cucumber salad. I have
also used the mixture to make meatballs. These go nicely with a
dipping sauce made of sour cream blended with a bit of the liquid
from the pickled beets.
