1. Cut pheasant legs through the joints to separate drumsticks from
thighs. Set drumsticks aside; bone and skin thighs and breasts.
Refrigerate remaining pheasant pieces and bones for another use.

2. Place wood in smoker and ignite following manufacturer's
directions. Or, place a layer of wood in the bottom of an
aluminum-foll-lined shallow roasting pan, place rack over wood in
roasting pan.

3. Arrange boned pheasant thighs and breasts and the drumsticks on
rack in smoker or roasting pan. Brush with whiskey. Sprinkle with
salt and sugar.

4. If using smoker, smoke pheasant 12 to 15 minutes or until cooked
through. If using roasting pan, cover very tightly with lid or
aluminum foil. Place over 2 burners of range, Heat over medium-high
heat until smoke is produced. Lower heat and smoke pheasant 15
minutes. Turn off heat; allow pheasant to stand 5 minutes before
cover is removed. (If using roasting pan on electric range, shake pan
occasionally so wood burns evenly.)

Apple Barbecue Sauce: In a heavy 1-quart saucepan, combine 1 C
applesauce, 1/4 C firmly packed light-brown sugar, 2 T cider vinegar,
1/2 t chili powder, and 1/4 t ground cloves. Heat to boiling over
high heat; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, 2
minutes. Country Living Holidays/92 Scanned & fixed by Di Pahl & <gg>
