Title: RUTH ALMANS SOURDOUGH STARTER
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Thick Potato water
2 tb Sugar
2 c  Flour (more or less)
1/2 ts Yeast (use yeast only to
-speed action)
Dump above into Sourdough Pot.

Boil potatoes with jackets on until they fall to pieces.

Lift skins out, mash potatoes making a puree.  Cool. Add more water
to make sufficient liquid, if necessary. Richter the potatoe starter,
richer the starter.  Put all  ingredients  in pot. Beat until smooth
creamy batter. Cover. Set  aside  to start fermentation.

*My Note After the starter has had about 3 days to get going good,
put in refrigerator.   Take  out  what you need to make bread,
pancakes...put equal amount of flour and water in that you take
starter out. One teaspoon of this will  make  a  phenomenal amount of
starter...this is a KILLER sourdough.
