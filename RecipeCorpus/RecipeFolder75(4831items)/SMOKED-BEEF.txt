Title: SMOKED BEEF
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1    2-4 lb lean beef roast
1 tb Garlic Powder
1 tb Onion Powder
1 tb Black Pepper
1 ts Chili Powder
1 tb Salt
1 tb Paprika
1 tb Cayenne Pepper
1 ts Cumin
* Use a covered Grill (Webber is the best.) or make a cover for your
grill
with aluminum foil and Clothes hangers. * Build two fires on each
side of where the meat will be. * Place a drip pan (alumimum foil
again) with water under where the meat
will be. * Soak your smoking wood (preferably hickory) at least
overnight.

Mix the spices together to make a dry rub.   Rub the spice mixture on
the trimmed beef roast and let marinate overnight in your icebox.
When the fire has developed to ash covered, add the smoking wood and
the meat, cover, and don't peek for at least 2 hours. Then add
charcoal and smoke for another 2 hours. As always, adjust as
necessary but the slower you smoke, the longer it will take and the
more tender the meat will be. Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK
