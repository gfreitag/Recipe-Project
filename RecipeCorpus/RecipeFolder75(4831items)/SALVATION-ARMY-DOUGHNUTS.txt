Title: SALVATION ARMY DOUGHNUTS
Categories: Breakfast, Breads, Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
2 tb Vegetable shortening
1 c  Sugar
2    Beaten eggs
4 3/4 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
3/4 c  Milk
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Vanilla powder or
-vanilla extract.
Cream shortening and sugar until fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla if
using extract and beat well. Combine dry ingredients (including
vanilla if using powder) then sift together. Add dry mixture to
creamed mixture, alternating with milk. Roll dough 1/2 inch thick on
floured board. Cut into rounds, and cut out centers. A glass works
well for cutting, with a small, empty prescription pill bottle to cut
the centers. The centers can be rolled together for more doughnuts or
fried as they are for 'donut holes.' Deep fry in vegetable oil,
turning once, until browned. Drain on grocery bag (to absorb oil) and
dust with confectioner's sugar. Yield: depends on how thin you roll,
and what you do with the centers.
