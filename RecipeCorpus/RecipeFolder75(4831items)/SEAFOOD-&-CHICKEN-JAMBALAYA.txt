Title: SEAFOOD & CHICKEN JAMBALAYA
Categories: Chicken, Cajun
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Bay leaves
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts White pepper
1 1/2 ts Red pepper
1 ts Dried thyme leaves
1/4 lb Chopped (1/4") tasso or
-smoked ham
3/4 c  ( 1/2 chopped, 1/4 sliced )
-andouille (or kielbasa
1 lg White onion
4    Ribs celery (1/4" chop)
1 lg Green
3    Minced med cloves garlic
1 md Can tomato sauce
4 md Chopped and peeled tomatoes
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
2 c  Converted rice (UNCOOKED!)
2 c  Chicken broth
3/4 lb Med peeled shrimp
1/2 lb Chopped chicken (bite size)
In large pot, on medium heat, (I use a 6 quart cast iron pot) saute'
the tasso and andouille until they start to brown.
Add 1/2 the  white
onion, celery and bell pepper and saute' until tender. Add 1/4 the
seasonings and continue until they just start to brown. Add the
other
1/2 white onion, celery and bell pepper and saute' until they turn
tender.  Scrape the bottom often so nothing sticks, but allow the
meat
and first veggies to brown, not burn. Add the chicken and stir in
until all the outside of the chicken has changed color. Add the rest
of the seasonings and the garlic.  Keep scraping the bottom so
nothing
burns.  Add the tomatoes, the tomato sauce and the green onions.
Cook
until all is heated together.   Add the chicken stock and bring to a
boil.  Add the rice, cover and reduce heat to a simmer but keep it
bubbling.  After about 10 minutes, stir in the shrimp. After about
10
minutes, remove the bay leaves and check the rice. When the rice is
to your liking (from crunchy or soft), SERVE and enjoy.
