Title: SHRIMP SOUP (WILSON)
Categories: Soups
Yield: 10 Servings
8 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Green onions, chopped
Salt, to taste
1 tb Lea & Perrins
2 c  White wine, dry
2 ts Louisiana hot sauce
1/2 c  Celery, chopped
1 tb Garlic, diced
1 c  Parsley, chopped
2 lb Shrimp, chopped
Put ingredients, except shrimp, in chicken stock. Bring to boil and
then lower heat.  Cover, and cook for 45 minutes. Add shrimp and
simmer for 30 minutes more. You may wish to experiment with the
amount of wine you use. 2 cups in the pot may be a bit much for some
taste. If that is so, you may take the rest internally. From Justin
