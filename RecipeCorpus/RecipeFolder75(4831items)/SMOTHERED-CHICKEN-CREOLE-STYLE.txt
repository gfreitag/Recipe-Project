Title: SMOTHERED CHICKEN CREOLE STYLE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Chicken, ca. 3.5 lbs,
-butterflied (split down
-the backbone, breast intact
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Butter
1 c  Finely chopped onion
1 c  Finely chopped celery
1 c  Finely chopped, cored and
-seeded green pepper
1 1/2 ts Finely minced garlic
2 tb Flour
1 3/4 c  Canned imported tomatoes,
-crushed or chopped
1    Bay leaf
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Select a black
iron skillet large enough to hold the chicken comfortably when it's
spread out. Fold wings under to secure them.

Melt the butter in the skillet and add the chicken, skin-side down.
Cover firmly with a plate which fits comfortably inside the skillet
and add about 5 lbs of weight to the top of the plate. Cook over low
heat until the skin side of the chicken is nicely browned, about 15
min.

Remove chicken to a warm platter. Add the onion, celery, pepper, and
garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring, until the onions are
wilted. Sprinkle with flour and stir to blend. Add tomatoes, bay
leaf, salt and pepper, stirring rapidly with a whisk. Bring to a boil.

Return chicken to the sauce, skin-side up. Cover with plate and
weight and cook over low heat 45 min more. Remove chicken, cook down
sauce briefly with stirring, pour over chicken and sprinkle with
parsley.
