Title: SOLE WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Filet of sole
Salt and pepper to taste
Flour for dredging
3 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
1/3 c  Balsamic vinegar
2 ts Capers
Tasty, refreshing and easy to prepare - sole filets are pan-fried in
olive oil and butter, and doused with balsamic vinegar for a sweet,
tangy flavor enhancer. Sure to set your taste buds dancing!

1. Season the filets with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour. 2. In a
large non-stick fry pan, heat the butter and oil over medium high
heat. When hot, add the fish and saute 3 to 4 minutes per side until
golden. 3. Douse the filets with the vinegar, sprinkle with the
capers, and saute 1 minute more, basting constantly. Let the vinegar
cook down and become syrupy and the fish glazed before removing to a
platter to serve.
