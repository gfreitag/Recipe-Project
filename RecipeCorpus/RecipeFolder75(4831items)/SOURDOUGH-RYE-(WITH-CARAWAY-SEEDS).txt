Yipes!  You're right!  I left stuff out!  Sorry.  Here is the
sourdough starter and corrected rye bread recipe. I've added the
proportions of Rye Flour salt and sugar that I missed.

1.  Combine the yeast, warm water, and sugar and let stand until very
foamy, about 10 minutes..

2.  Dissolve the salt in the tepid water ans stir thet mixture into
the sourdough starter.   Beat in the yeast mixture, then the caraway
seeds (or what ever you sub). Beat in the rye flour, about 1/2 cup at
a time, then beat in the gluten flour.

3.  Spread 2 cups of the all-purpose flour in a ring on a kneading
surface and pur the dough into the center of the ring. Mix roughly
with a dough scraper or a pancake turner, then knead just until
thouroughly mixed, adding as much of the remaining white flour as
necessary to make a medium-stiff dough, not too heavy.

4.  Scrape the kneading surface, dust it with rye flour, and knead the
dough very thouroughly until it is elastic and smoooth surfaced. Don't
overflour the board; keep the dough as close as possible to medium
stiff not heavy.

5.  Form the dough into a ball and place in an ungreased bowl (it will
stick a bit so you don't want to use metal); cover with plastic and
let rise until doubled in bulk, at least 1 hour.

6.  Turn the dough onto your kneading surface, dusted lightly with rye
flour, then expel the air from it and form it inot two smooth balls.
Cover with a towel and let rest 20 minutes, meanwhile sprinkling
cornmeal on ===============   Reply   67 of Note    1
