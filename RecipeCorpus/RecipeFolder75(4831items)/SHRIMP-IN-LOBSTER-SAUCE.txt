1/2 lb Pork, coarsely ground

MARINATE THE SHRIMP in the egg white and cornstarch for 20 minutes in
the refrigerator. Fry the shrimp in 1 1/2 cups oil at a moderate
temperature (325F). Or, to simplify, stir-fry them in a wok in 3
tablespoons of oil just until they turn opaque. Remove them from the
wok. Brown the ground pork in 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the rest of
the sauce ingredients. Bring them to a boil and add the cornstarch to
thicken the sauce lightly. Turn off the heat. Stir in the beaten egg,
pulling the clumps of egg into thin strands with chopsticks as they
cook. Stir in the cooked shrimp to coat them with the sauce.
