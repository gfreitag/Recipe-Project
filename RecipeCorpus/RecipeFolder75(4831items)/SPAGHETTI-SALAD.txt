Title: SPAGHETTI SALAD
Categories: Cheese, Main dish, Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 24 Servings
2 lb Spaghetti
3    Tomatoes; diced
8 oz Medium Cheddar cheese
-- shredded
2    Cucumbers; diced
1 bn Green onions; diced
-- (or 1 md. regular onion)
1    Green pepper; chopped
1    Jar Salad Supreme/McCormick
8 oz Bottle Italian dressing
Chopped ham (opt'l.)
Cook spaghetti.  Drain, rinse, & cool.  Rinse w/cold water again and
*drain well*.

Add all other ingredients; mix well.  Taste and add any salt, pepper,
etc. as desired.  Adjust and add more tomatoes, green onions, etc. as
needed. In the summertime, I also like to add some chopped fresh
basil and oregano. Let stand at least 2 hrs.  (The longer this stands
the better, so this can be easily made & refrigerated the night
before.)

Optional:  Add any chopped meat.  Chopped ham is the best.

Note:  This recipe makes a lot, but can be easily halved.

Recipe from Dora Johnson/Seminole, Alabama.  First had this on
01/30/86 and made it myself on 04/28/89.
