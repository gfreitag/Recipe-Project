making the seafood stock. Peel the shrimp and use the heads and
shells to make the stock; refrigerate shrimp until ready to use.
In a large skillet melt the butter with the oil.

white pepper, thyme and cayenne pepper; saute over medium heat 5
minutes, stirring frequently. Add the stock and continue cooking over

much as possible. Heat through and serve immediately. From Paul
