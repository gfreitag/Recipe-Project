Title: SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CUMIN & FRAGRANT HERBS
Categories: Indian, Eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
6 lg Eggs
1 ts Kosher salt
2 tb Light vegetable oil
2 md Onions, peeled, cut into 3/4
-inch pieces
1/2 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
1 tb Finely chopped fresh
-Coriander leaves *
1    To 2 green chilies, seeded
-and sliced (optional)
1. Break the eggs into a small bowl, add salt, and beat slightly to
mix. Do not overbeat, as eggs should not be foamy or frothy.

2. Beat the shortening or oil in a frying pan (9-10 inches in
diameter), and add onions. Over medium-low heat, saute onions until
they are translucent but still firm and crisp (about 3-4 minutes).

3. Reduce heat to low, and add the beaten eggs.  Let the eggs settle
in the pan for 5 seconds.  Then, using a fork, begin pushing the egg
toward the center of the pan so that it cooks like a thick cake. When
most of the egg has coagulated, turn it gently and cook the other
side. (Don't worry if it breaks, as the finished dish will, in fact,
look like little cakes of scrambled egg studded with onions.)
Continue stirring and turning until the eggs are fully cooked (about
3 minutes). Do not let them brown. Turn off heat, and transfer to a
warm serving platter. Serve sprinkled with roasted cumin, chopped
coriander leaves and green chilies.

* To roast the cumin, add to a dry, preheated, heavy frying pan, and
cook until the seeds turn a dark brown. Grind fine, and you're ready
to go.
