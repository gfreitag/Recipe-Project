(The Scotch recipe featured is from a series of radio talks on "Menus
of Allied Nations" in World War II.)

Brown ground beef and minced onion in hot oil.  Then mix, stirring
very little, with milk, salt and pepper. Cover; simmer until meat is
done (15 min.).  Serve hot on platter... in border of fluffy mashed
potatoes.

Allied tip:  All you have to do to make ground meat go further: mix
it with Wheaties, bread or cracker crumbs, cooked rice, oatmeal,
crushed zweiback crackers, and moisten with a little milk.
