MMMMM--------------------------MUFFINS-------------------------------
3    Med. peaches, pitted, diced
1/2 c  Milk
1    Lg. egg
1/2 c  Sour cream
1 ts Vanilla extract
4 tb Butter, melted
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
Prepare topping:  In small bowl stir together the flour, sugar and
cinnamon; with a fork, work in the butter until crumbly. Refrigerate
until needed.

Preheat oven to 400F.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners or
generously butter the cups and the top of the pan around the muffin
cups. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg. Then whisk in the sour cream,
milk, vanilla and melted butter.  Stir in the diced peaches. In a
large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
soda and salt. Pour in the sour cream-peach mixture all at once and
stir quickly, just to moisten; the batter will be thick and lumpy.
Spoon into muffin cups, dividing it equally until the cups are full.
Quickly crumble the topping over the batter. Bake at 25 to 30 minutes
or until golden brown. The tops will spring back when lightly
touched.  Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then carefully remove
and cool on a rack. Cool 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm.
