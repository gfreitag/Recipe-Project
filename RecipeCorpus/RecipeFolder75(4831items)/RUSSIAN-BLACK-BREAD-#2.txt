In large mixer bowl combine 3 cups of the all-purpose flour, 1 cup of
the rye flour, the whole bran cereal, the yeast, coffee crystals,
caraway seed, sugar salt, and fennel seed. In saucepan heat together
the 2 1/2 cups water, molasses, butter or margarine, chocolate, and
vinegar just till warm (115 to 120 deg.F) and chocolate and butter
are almost melted; stir constantly.  Add molasses mixture to flour
mixture in mixer bowl. Beat at low speed of electric mixer 1/2
minute, scraping bowl. Beat 3 minutes at high speed. Stir in
remaining 3 cups rye flour and as much of the remaining all-purpose
flour as you can mix in with a spoon. Turn out onto lightly floured
surface.  Knead in enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to make
a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes
total). (Dough may be slightly sticky because of the rye flour.)
Shape into a ball. Place in lightly greased bowl; turn once to grease
surface. Cover; let rise in warm place till nearly double (1 1/4 to 1
1/2 hours). Punch down; divide in half. Shape each half into a ball.
Place on greased baking sheets. Flatten slightly with palm of hand to
6-to 7-inch diameter. Cover; let rise till nearly double (30 to 45
minutes). Bake in 375 deg. oven for 50 to 60 minutes or till well
browned and bread sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from baking
sheets; cool on wire rack. Meanwhile, in small saucepan combine the
1/2 cup cold water and cornstarch. Cook and stir till thickened and
bubbly; cook 1 minute more. Brush over hot bread. Makes 2 loaves.
