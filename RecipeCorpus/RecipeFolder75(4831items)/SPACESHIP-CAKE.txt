Makes 10 Servings

ingredients above)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Prepare cake mix as directed.  Pour batter into long, shallow loaf
pan. Bake cake for 20 minutes, or until done. Cool slightly before
removing from pan.  Place cake on rack, top side down. With sharp
knife, cut off sharp corners of cake.  Stick almonds into cake ina
staggered row design. Cover to prevent drying.

Combine hot water, corn syrup and margarine in top of a double boiler.
Bring mixture to a boil.  Continue to boil until margarine melts.
Remove from heat; stir in chocolate chips. Beat until sauce is
combined. (or, heat Hot Fudge Sauce over a double boiler until it
drips from a spoon.) Cool sauce to warm; spoon slowly over cake with
almonds. (This process must be done slowly to allow the sauce time to
adhere to the nuts and cake.) Allow sauce to set before serving.
