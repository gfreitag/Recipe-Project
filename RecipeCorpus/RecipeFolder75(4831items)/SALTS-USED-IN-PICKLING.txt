Title: SALTS USED IN PICKLING
Categories: Preserves, Pickles, Canning
Yield: 1 Text  Use of canning or pickling salt is recommended. Fermented and
non-fermented pickles may be safely made using either iodized or
non-iodized table salt. However, non-caking materials added to table
salts may make the brine cloudy. Flake salt varies in density and is
not recommended for use.

Reduced-sodium salts, for example, "Lite Salt" may be used in quick
pickle recipes, as indicated in this guide. The pickles may, however,
have a slightly different taste than expected. Caution: Use of
reduced-sodium salt in fermented pickle recipes is not recommended.
