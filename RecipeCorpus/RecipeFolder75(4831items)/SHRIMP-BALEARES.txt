chili peppers and onion and cook until the onion is soft and lightly
browned. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the liquid by half
and add the tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cook until most of the tomato
juice has evaporated.  Add the shrimp and cook for 5 to 7 minutes or
until they turn a bright pink. Do not overcook them or they will get
tough. Add the capers, olives and the parsley vinegar, garlic and
anchovy mixture and heat through.  Correct the seasoning and pour
