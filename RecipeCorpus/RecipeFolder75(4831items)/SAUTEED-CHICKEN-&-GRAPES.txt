Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat on the stove. Add
chicken pieces, in batches, if necessary, without crowding the
skillet, and brown on all sides until golden. Transfer the thighs and
drumsticks to a large casserole or Dutch oven as they are done. Set
the breasts aside. Add the Madeira, cream, bay leaves and thyme.
Cover and place in the oven. After 10 minutes, add the liver and the
breasts and replace in oven for another 25 minutes. When it's time to
serve dinner, arrange chicken pieces on a serving platter and keep
warm in the oven while finishing sauce. Remove bay leaves and thyme
sprigs, pour sauce and livers into a blender or food processor and
blend until smooth. Add salt as needed. Strain sauce into a saucepan,
place over medium heat on the stove and add the grapes. Simmer for 2
minutes to heat the grapes. Remove the chicken from the oven, spoon
sauce and grapes over it and serve immediately.
