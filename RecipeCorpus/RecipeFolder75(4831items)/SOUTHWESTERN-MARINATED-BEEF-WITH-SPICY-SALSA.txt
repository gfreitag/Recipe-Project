In a large bowl place the olive oil, malt vinegar, red wine, rosemary,
thyme, oregano, crushed red pepper, garlic, and Dijon mustard. Whisk
the ingredients together so that they are well blended.

Add the steaks and place them in the refrigerator. Julian lets them
marinate overnight.

Grill the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until the desired
doneness is achieved.

Meanwhile, brush the vegetables with the marinade, and quickly grill
them until they are tender (starting with the eggplant, which takes
longer).

On each of 4 individual serving plates place 2 steak halves. Place the
grilled vegetables in between the 2 pieces of meat. Ladle the Spicy
Salsa on top.
