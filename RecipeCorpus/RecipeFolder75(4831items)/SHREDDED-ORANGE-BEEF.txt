Recipe by: Quick & Easy Stir Fry Recipes Cut beef lengthwise in half.
Cut across the grain into 2 x 1/4-inch slices. Whisk together egg
white, 1 Tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon cornstarch and sesame oil
in a large bowl. Add beef and toss to coat. Marinate 15 minutes or
cover and refrigerate overnight.

Cut onions crosswise into 3-inch pieces.  Cut lengthwise into fine
slivers. Cut jalapenos lengthwise in half. Remove stems and seeds.
Diagonally cut halves into 1/8-inch slices.  Set aside.

Remove 2x3/4-inch strips of peel (colored portion only) from orange
with vegetable peeler.  Cut peel into 1/8-inch-thick strips; set
aside.

Combine sugar, sherry, vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 2
teaspoons cornstarch in small bowl; stir until smooth. Set aside.

Heat vegetable oil in wok over medium-high heat until oil registers
375F on deep fry thermometer.  Add carrots; fry about 3 minutes or
until tender. Remove carrots with slotted spoon and place in large
strainer set over medium bowl.  reheat oil; fry orange peel about 15
seconds or until fragrant.  Remove to paper towels; drain.

Add beef to wok; fry about 1 minute or just until meat turns light in
color.  Remove beef to colander or strainer placed over large bowl.
Reheat oil.  Place 1/3 of drained beef in oil; fry about 3 minutes or
until browned.  Transfer beef to strainer with carrots. (Double
frying the meat keeps the meat moist inside and crispy outside.)
repeat with remaining beef in two batches, reheating oil to maintain
temperature.

Pour off oil from wok.  reheat wok over medium-high heat. Add onions,
garlic and jalapenos; stir-fry about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
