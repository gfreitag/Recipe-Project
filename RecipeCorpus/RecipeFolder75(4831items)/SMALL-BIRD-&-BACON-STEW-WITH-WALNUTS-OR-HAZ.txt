Title: SMALL BIRD & BACON STEW WITH WALNUTS OR HAZ
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Fatty rashers of bacon,
-chopped roughly
3    Cloves garlic
4    Pigeons or other small game
-birds (6 if very small)
8 oz Mushrooms, chopped roughly
3 oz Hazelnuts or walnuts,
-roasted, coarsely chopped
1 1/4 c  Real ale
3/4 c  Water
3    Bay leaves
-salt
-black pepper, fresh ground
6    Coarse slices brown bread
Fry the bacon, with the garlic, till it is lightly browned in a heavy
bottomed casserole. Add birds and brown on all sides. Add the
mushrooms and nuts, continue to cook for a couple of minutes, then
add the ale and water with the bay leaves. Bring to the boil, cover
and simmer very gently for 2 ~ 2 1/2 hours-- the birds should be
falling off the bone. Remove the birds from the juices, cool juices
completely and remove any excess fat. The birds can be served whole
on or off the bone. If the latter, carve them while they are cold
then return to the skimmed juices and reheat gently. Adjust the
seasoning to taste and serve either the whole birds of the slices on
the pieces of bread, with plenty of the juices and "bits". A good
green salad to follow is the best accompaniment.
