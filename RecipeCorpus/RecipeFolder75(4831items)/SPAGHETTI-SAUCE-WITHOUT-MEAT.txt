Title: SPAGHETTI SAUCE WITHOUT MEAT
Categories: Sauces, Canning
Yield: 9 Pints
30 lb Tomatoes
1 c  Chopped onions
5    Garlic cloves; minced
1 c  Chopped celery
-OR- green pepper
1 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced
-(optional)
4 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Oregano
4 tb Minced parsley
2 ts Black pepper
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
Yield: About 9 pints

Procedure: Caution: Do not increase the proportion of onions,
peppers, or mushrooms. Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30
to 60 seconds or until skins split. Dip in cold water and slip off
skins. Remove cores and quarter tomatoes. Boil 20 minutes, uncovered,
in large saucepan. Put through food mill or sieve. Saute onions,
garlic, celery or peppers, and mushrooms (if desired) in vegetable
oil until tender. Combine sauteed vegetables andtomatoes and add
remainder of spices, salt, and sugar. Bring to a boil. Simmer
uncovered, until thick enough for serving. At this time the initial
volume will have been reduced by nearly one-half. Stir frequently to
avoid burning. Fill jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Adjust lids and
process according to the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2,
depending on the method of canning used.
