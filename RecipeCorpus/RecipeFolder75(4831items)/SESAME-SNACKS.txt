Title: SESAME SNACKS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 90 Servings
5 tb Sesame seeds, toasted
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Oil
1/2 c  Water
1    Egg, lightly beaten and
Diluted with 1 to 2 Tb milk
For brushing the tops
"The flavor of sesame comes through very nicely in these crispy
crackers. Try them wih your favorite chutney or with cream cheese and
jam. If you are feeling extravagant, spread them with sour cream and
caviar. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~ F. In a food
mill or blender, grind the sesame seeds until coarsely broken. A food
processor will not effectively grind this small quantity. If
preferred, you can leave the seeds whole. In a large bowl or in the
food processor, stir together the flour, seeds, and salt. Add the oil
and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in enough of
the water, a little at a time, to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball. If necessary, add up to 1 additional
Tablespoon of water. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for
rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll to 1/16 inch
thick. With a sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut in desired shapes
approximately 2 inches across. Arrange on an ungreased baking sheet.
Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Brush
the tops lightly with the egg mixture. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or
until the crackers are light to medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield:
85-90.
