Title: SOUTH-WESTERN BLACK EYED PEAS
Categories: Main dish, Mexican, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Dried black eyed peas
4 c  Water
1/4 ts Red chile flakes, crushed
1/2 ts Cumin
2 tb Olive oil
3/4 c  Green onions, thinly sliced
2 ea Celery ribs, thinly sliced
3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
2 c  Mexican style stewed Tomatoe
Rinse beans, cover in water & bring to a boil.  Cook for 3 minutes,
remove from heat & let sit for 1 hour. Drain & rinse. Cover with
fresh water, bring back to a boil & cook for 30 minutes. Drain & set
side.

Saute chile flakes in oil for 1 minute.  Add green onions, celery,
garlic & beans.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Stir
in the tomatoes. Reduce heat & simmer for 30 minutes. Serve hot.

MARK'S NOTE: I really do not think that black-eyed peas need this much
cooking.  When making this dish, I omit the soaking stage & just cook
for 30 minutes & then let them finish cooking with the remaining
ingredients.
