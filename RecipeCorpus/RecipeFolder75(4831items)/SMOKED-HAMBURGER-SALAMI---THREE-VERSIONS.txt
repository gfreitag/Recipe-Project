Mix all ingredients thoroughly then cover and chill 24 hours or more.
Divide into 4 portions.  Roll portions into 2 1/3"-3" diameter rolls
and wrap with inexpensive large hole nylon net. Tie ends securely
with string (net may be omitted, but rolls flatten out during
smoking).

Smoke in smoker for 8-12 hours with the fuel of your choice. This
assumes a cold smoke.  Adjust times accordingly, but make sure salami
is done throughout.

Remove from smoker- remove netting and dry thoroughly with paper
towel. Wrap in foil and refrigerate up to 3 weeks or freeze up to 6
months. It is so easy to make you don't have to make large quantities
and store.

*** Curing Salt (VERY IMPORTANT) Use only 'Tender Quick' or prepared
curing salt.  Regular salt does not have the flavors, taste or
nitrate added to the quick cure and will not bind the meat required
to make these recipes successful.  You may purchase prepared curing
salts sold by Mortons, Lowery's and other companies. Check in your
local supermarket near where they have the salt... Other sources
would be butcher shops, wine stores and feed stores.
