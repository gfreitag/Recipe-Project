Categories: Beef, Bar-b-q, Sandwiches
Yield: 10 Servings
6 lb Beef brisket
1/2 ts Liquid smoke
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Dry mustard
10    French rolls (old fashion)
BARBECUE SAUCE:
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Vidalia onions, chopped
2 tb Minced garlic
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1 c  Ketchup
1/2 c  Malt vinegar
1/4 c  Dark brown sugar
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Liquid smoke
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place brisket in a roasting pan and
brush with liquid smoke.  Combine the salt and spices in a small
bowl, mix well.
Apply this on the brisket with a brush.  Cover the roasting pan and
bake until the brisket is fork tender, about 3 hours. Remove the pan
from the oven and use two forks to pull the meat apart, shredding if
coarsely.

For each sandwich, halve a roll.  Spoon 2 tablespoons heated barbecue
sauce over the bottom.  Using a slotted spoon, pile about 1 cup of
the shredded meat on each roll. Pour 2 or 3 tablespoons sauce over
the meat and cover with the top half of the roll.  Serve with
additional Barbecue Sauce on the side.

Barbecue Sauce:  Heat the oil in a medium sized pan. Add the onion,
garlic, cumin and cayenne and saute' at 400 degrees for 5 minutes or
until the onions are light brown. Stir in the remaining ingredients
and simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
Makes 2 cups.
