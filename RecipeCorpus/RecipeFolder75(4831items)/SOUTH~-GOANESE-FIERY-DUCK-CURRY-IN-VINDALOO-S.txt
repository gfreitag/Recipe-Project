~----INSTRUCTIONS-----

Goa has developed its own cuisine and vindaloo is one of its main
creations. Two important features of vindaloo are the tech- nique of
marinating meat in vinegar and the use of fiery spices. Although I
have reduced the number of chiles, 4 more may be added if a hotter
dish is desired. Cornish hens may be substituted for duck. Soak
chiles in vinegar for 15 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and blend
into a puree. Scrape mixture into a small bowl. Add cumin, coriander
and cinnamon and mix thoroughly.  Coat duck pieces well with spice
paste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Heat oil in a
large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add duck pieces and brown on
all sides. Add salt, water, sugar and any remaining spice puree.
Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until duck
is tender, about 1 hour. Skim off all fat. Transfer duck to a heated
platter, pour sauce over, and garnish with minced cilantro. Serves 4
to 6. PER SERVING: 335 calories, 36 g protein, 3 g carbohydrate, 19 g
