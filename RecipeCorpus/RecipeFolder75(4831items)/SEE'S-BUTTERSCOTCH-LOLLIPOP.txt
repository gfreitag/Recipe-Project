called the hard-crack stage), or until a small amount dropped in cold
water separates into hard, brittle threads. 3. Stir in the vanilla,
then remove from the heat. 4. Coat the molds with nonstick spray and
pour the mixture in. (If you are using shot glasses, be sure to cool
the mixture first so that the glass won't crack.) 5. Place a small
piece of aluminum foil over each mold and press a lollipop stick or
popsicle stick in the center. 6. When cool, remove from molds. Makes
1 dozen lollipops.
