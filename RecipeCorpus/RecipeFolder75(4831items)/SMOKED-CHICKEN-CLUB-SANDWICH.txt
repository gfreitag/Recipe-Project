Start to cook the bacon so that it becomes crisp. In a blender or food
processor puree the olives, mustard, anchovy paste, olive oil,
vinegar, and garlic; season to taste with salt and pepper and adjust
amount of vinegar for tang.

Toast the bread lightly. Remove bacon to paper towels to drain.

To assemble, spread each slice of bread with olive mixture, on one
side only. Set some bacon on bottom of bread, then top with tomato
and onion slices, chicken and cucumber; salt and pepper each layer
lightly as you go. Top with bread, mayonnaise side down; repeat with
second layer of fillings and finish with third slice of bread, olive
mixture side down. Assemble the second sandwich in the same way.
