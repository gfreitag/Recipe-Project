Title: SAUSAGE TRIANGLES
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 42 Servings
8 oz Pork sausage
1/2 lb Mushrooms, diced
1/4 lb Monterey Jack, shredded
1/2 c  Butter, melted
1/3    16oz pkg frozen phyllo
In 10" skillet over medium-high heat, cook pork sausage and mushrooms
until meat is well browned and mushrooms are tender, stirring
occasionally. With slotted spoon, remove sausage mixture to paper
towels to drain. In large bowl, mix sausage mixture and shredded
cheese.

With knife, cut phyllo lengthwise into 2" wide strips. Place strips on
waxed paper; then cover with slightly damp paper towel to prevent
phyllo from drying out.

Place 1 strip of phyllo on work surface; brush top lightly with melted
butter.  Place about 1 teaspoon sausage mixture at end of strip. Fold
one corner of strip diagonally over filling so that short edge meets
the long edge of the strip, forming a right angle. Continue folding
over at right angle.  Continue folding over at right angles until you
reach the end of the strip to form a triangular-shaped package. Place
package, seam-side down, in 15 1/2" X 10 1/2" jelly-roll pan; brush
with butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo strips and sausage mixture.
If not serving right away, cover with foil and refrigerate.

To serve, preheat oven to 425oF.  Bake triangles 15 minutes or until
golden.  Makes about 3 1/2 dozen hors d'oeuvres. Each triangle: About
