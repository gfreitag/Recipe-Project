Title: SHAKE -N- BAKE
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Dry  bread crumbs
1 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Canola oil
1 tb Onion powder
2 ts Salt  (or omit)
1 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Paprika
1 tb Bell's season'g
2 ts Ground celery seed
Put the dry crumbs in a large bowl and mix the oil in thoroughly with
a whisk or pastry blender.  (When fully mixed through, you get a
negligible amount per serving when coating anything.) Then mix in the
rest of the ingredients.  Use your imagination.  You could make a 1/2
recipe and use Italian seasoning instead of Bells; add sesame or
poppy seeds, lemon pepper, etc. It does need that little oil to stick
to things and brown properly.  The original recipe I adapted it from
used much more oil. At least there is no MSG or other chemicals or
preservatives in this. I keep mine in the freezer. It takes 45 min at
375 degrees to brown.
