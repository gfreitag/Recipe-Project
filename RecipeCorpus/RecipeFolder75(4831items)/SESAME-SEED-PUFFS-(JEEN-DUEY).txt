*Recipe is included in this collection. WRAPPING: Divide dough in
half and separate each half into 12 portions. Roll each to form a
ball. Flatten by hand to a 3 inch round. Put 1 teaspoon of red bean
paste or sweet crescent filling in center, press opposite sides
together to seal. Roll again in palms to form a round ball. Roll ball
in sesame seeds. Repeat with rest of the dough. COOKING: Heat oil in
wok over medium heat (350 degrees in a deep fryer). Deep fry four
balls per batch, moving them constantly so they do not stay at the
bottom. After 2-3 minutes, balls will start to float. Rotate them
with chopsticks or a slotted spoon, gently pushing them against the
side of the wok. (This action will help the balls retain a rounder
shape). Continue frying them until the balls attain a medium golden
brown color. (Approximately 8-10 minutes.) Drain on paper towel and
cool for 5 minutes before serving. DO AHEAD NOTES: Jeen Dueys can be
made ahead and kept refrigerated for several days. Reheat by deep
frying or in oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Source: "Dim Sum" by
