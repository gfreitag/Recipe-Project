Categories: Soups, Fruits, Hungarian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Flour
1 c  Sour cream
1 pn Salt
1 ts Confectioner's sugar
1 lb Fresh sour cherries, pitted
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
Stir flour with sour cream, salt, and confectioner's sugar till
smooth.

Meantime, cook sour cherries in 1 1/2 quarts water with granulated
sugar till done.

Take 2 ladlefuls of liquid from the cherry pot and add to the flour
mixture, stir for a few minutes.

Pour the mixture back into the soup and simmer for 5 minutes. Cover
the soup and let it cool that way; this way it won't develop a skin.
Adjust salt.

make it with canned fruit.
