Note:  Did not feel like going out for wrappers I substituted alum
foil for wrappers. 4 inch square. Did not spray the basket. Added 2
beaten eggs to filling. After steaming, carefully unfolded 6
dumplings onto each of 4 indivual plates .Made double the amount of
sauce and dabbed it on on the dumplings instead of dipping.
