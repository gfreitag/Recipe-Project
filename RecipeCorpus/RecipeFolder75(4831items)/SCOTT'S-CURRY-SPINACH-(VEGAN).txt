Title: SCOTT'S CURRY SPINACH (VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Cooked basmati rice
x  Onions
x  Frozen spinach
x  1 can creamed corn
x  Curry
Sautee onions in a pan (use broth, vinegar, or Pam). When soft, add
frozen block of chopped spinach (if you were clever enough to thaw
it, so much the better). Stir for a minute. Put in pyrex pan (yes,
these recipes are brought to you by Pyrex, makers of fine bakeware.
Back over to you, Alex). Dump one can of creamed corn on it. No,
creamed corn doesn't have any cream, it is just blended.  Douse
liberally in curry! Get good curry bulk from an Indian/Oriental
market and avoide the McCormick's stuff which is 44$/lb. Bake the
onions, spinach, and creamed corn (with curry!) for 20 minutes on 350
or so. Serve over basamati rice or just eat out of the pan.

Let me know what you all think!  (and, I know that I have a sentence
in there that reads "I..always be disappointed.." Yes, I know better,
this was hurriedly typed in before a meeting, so you can all go home
tonight and make that spinach curry dish.  I will be enjoying it,
too).
