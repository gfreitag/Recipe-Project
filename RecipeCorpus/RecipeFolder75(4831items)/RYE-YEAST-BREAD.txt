Title: RYE YEAST BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 c  Water
1 c  White grape juice
1 pk Quick-rise yeast (1 tb)
1 ts Salt
3 tb Oil
4 c  Rye flour plus up to 1/2 cup
Warm the water and grape juice to about 115 F and stir in the yeast.
Let the mixture stand for about 10 minutes or until it is foamy. Stir
in the salt, oil, and 2 cups of the flour, and beat it with a spoon
or mixer until it is smooth.

Add enough of the rest of the flour to make a soft dough. Knead the
dough on a floured board for 10 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled
bowl, turn it over so the top of the ball is also oiled, and cover it
with a towel. Let it rise in a warm (85 to 90 F) place for about 45
minutes, or until it is doubled in volume.

Shape the dough into a loaf, place it in an oiled 8 x 4 inch loaf
pan, and let it rise in a warm place again for about 30 minutes, or
until it doubles in volume. Bake at 425 F for 10 minutes, then lower
the oven temperature to 350 F for an additional 35 to 45 minutes of
baking. Remove it from the oven when the loaf is brown and has pulled
away from the sides of the pan slightly.  Makes one loaf.
