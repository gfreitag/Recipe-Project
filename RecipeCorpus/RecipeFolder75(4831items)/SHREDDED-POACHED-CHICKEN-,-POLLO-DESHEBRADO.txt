whole chicken, a 2 quart for a breast) and bring to a boil.  Cooking
the whole chicken:  Add the dark meat quarters.  Skim off any foam
that rises during the first few minutes of simmering, add the herbs
and bay leaves, partially cover and simmer over medium heat for 10
minutes. Add the breast quarters (plus additional hot water to cover,
if necessary), skim off any new foam that rises once the liquid
returns to a simmer, partially cover and simmer for 13 minutes. If
cooking only chicken breast: Add the breast quarters (plus additional
hot water to cover, if necessary).  Skim off any foam that rises
during the first minute of simmering, add the herbs and bay leaves,
partially cover and simmer over medium heat for 13 mintues. Remove
the pot from the fire and let the chicken (whether whole bird or just
breast) cool in the broth if there is time.  Skin and bone the
chicken, then shred the meat into small pieces. Sprinkle with salt
before using, unless directed otherwise in your recipe. Source:
