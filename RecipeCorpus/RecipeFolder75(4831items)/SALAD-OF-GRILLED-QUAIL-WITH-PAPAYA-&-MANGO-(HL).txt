Recipe by: RECIPE FOR HEALTH SHOW #RHI127 Marinate the quail
overnight. Grill it (barbecue or indoors) until it's slightly pink.
Baste it with the marinade while grilling. Let it sit while you
prepare the rest of the salad as follows: Wash and dry the lettuce
leaves; do not tear or cut them. Arrange several leaves to form a
cup. Peel the papaya, cut it in half lengthwise, and seed it. Cut
each half lengthwise into about 10 thin slices. On each plate, fan 3
slices across the lettuce. Peel the mangoes. Cut the meat away from
the bone, as thickly as possible, into about 12 chunks each. Place 4
chunks on one side of the papaya fan. Add a few slivers of onion. Cut
thin medallions from the quail breast -- 1/2 breast for each plate.
Arrange it in a fan opposite the papaya. Dress the salad with
commercial vinaigrette or use the recipe for raspberry walnut
vinaigrette given at left. Garnish if desired.
