Title: SINGIN' HINNEY
Categories: Breads, Cakes
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Plain flour
1/4 ts Bicarbonate of Soda
1/2 ts Cream of Tartar
1/2 ts Salt
3 oz Lard
3 oz Currants
Milk
Lightly grease a large thick based frying pan or girdle.

Sift flour, bicarb, cream of tartar and salt into a bowl. Add lard,
cut into small pieces, and rub in with the fingertips until mixture
resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add currants and about 6 tablespoons
milk; stir with a fork until just mixed to a soft dough. Place frying
pan over a low heat.

Turn out onto a floured board and knead lightly. Roll out to a
circle, 8 inches diameter. Place in frying pan and cook until golden
brown on underside - about 15 minutes. Turn with a fish-slice;
lightly press down edges with the slice and cook on the other side
for a further 8 to 10 minutes.

Remove from pan. Split in half with a sharp knife, spread half with
butter, sandwhich together and cut into wedges. Serve hot.

This is a recipe we picked up when we were living in County Durham -
Northern England. Very popular because it's cheap, simple, filling,
and delicious.
