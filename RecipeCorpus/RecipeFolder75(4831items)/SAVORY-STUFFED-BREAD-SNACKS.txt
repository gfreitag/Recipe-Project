Categories: Wedding
Yield: 48 Servings
4    6 inch long sandwich rolls
1    8 oz. pkg. cream cheese,
-softened
8 oz (1 1/3) cups) braunschweiger
-or liver sausage
1 c  Finely shredded carrots
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Chopped green onions
2 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
Heat oven to 350F.  Cut about 1/2 inch off both ends of each roll;
discard. Using teaspoon, remove bread from inside of roll, leaving
about 1/4 inch of crusty shell; set shells aside. Crumble soft bread
pieces; place on a cookie sheet.  Toast bread crumbs at 350F for 12
to 15 minutes or until golden brown; cool.

In large bowl, combine cream cheese and braunschweiger; beat until
smooth. By hand, stir in cooled bread crumbs and remaining
ingredients. Spoon about 1 cup of filling mixture into each bread
shell, pressing gently but firmly to remove air pockets. Wrap filled
shells in plastic wrap or place in plastic bag. Refrigerate at least
4 hours or until serving time. To serve, unwrap, slice into 3/8 inch
slices.
Tips: *Two 4 1/2 oz. cans deviled ham can be substituted for
braunschweiger.  To make ahead, prepare as directed above.
Refrigerate up to 2 days before serving. Yield: 48 bread snacks.
