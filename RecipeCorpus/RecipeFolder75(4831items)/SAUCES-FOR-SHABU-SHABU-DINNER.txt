Togarashi is a Japanese seasoning made of crushed red pepper and other
condiments, blended into a powder. Red or black pepper may be
substituted.

Editor's note: According to studies, uncooked eggs may not be safe
since, in rare instances, they may carry salmonella. If you are
reluctant to eat raw egg, an egg substitute such as Egg Beaters may
be used.

Sesame sauce: Grind sesame seeds using a mortar and pestle or a small
blender. Combine with soy sauce, oil, vinegar and water. Place garlic,
togarashi and onion on a separate plate for diners to add as they
wish. Place sauce in small individual dishes for each diner.

CREAMY MIZUTAKI SAUCE Combine egg, vinegar and 1/4 cup of the oil in a
blender. Process until creamy. Slowly add remaining oil at high speed
until mixture resembles mayonnaise. Transfer to a bowl and add sour
cream, soy sauce, main and broth.  Place sauce in small individual
dishes for each diner.

DAIKON SAUCE: Combine soy sauce, vinegar, daikon and togarashi. Add
enough water to achieve a light sauce consistency. Place sauce in
small dishes for each diner.
