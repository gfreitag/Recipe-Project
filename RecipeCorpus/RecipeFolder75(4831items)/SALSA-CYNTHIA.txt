This salsa is named for his publisher (Penguin Canada) who likes
things hot. Blanche the tomatoes in boiling water; then peel and see
(reserving seeds and peel.) Chop tomato flesh roughly and add to bowl
of food processor (not blender). Strain juice from peel and seeds.
Add to bowl. Peel onion and cut in eighths. Add to food processor
bowl. Remove stems from jalapeno; cut in halves. Scoop out and
discard core and most of seeds (the more seeds you leave in, the
hotter the sauce). Chop cleaned jalapeno and add to bowl (wash your
hands right after handling the pepper.) Add salt. Process contents of
food processor with a couple of quick pulses, then at high for no
more than a minute, until mixture is minced but not liquified.
Transfer mixture to pan; add oil. cook over medium heat 6 to 8
minutes until bubbling and foaming pink. Remove salsa from heat,; let
cool at least 10 minutes (an hour is better). Add lime juice to
cooled salsa and stir. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro.
