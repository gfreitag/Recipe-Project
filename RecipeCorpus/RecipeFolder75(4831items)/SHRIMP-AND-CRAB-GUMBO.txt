1 lb Okra -- cut into quarters

Shell and devein shrimp, leaving tail sections intact; reserve shells
for stock. Break sausage into 1/2-inch pieces; in a skillet, cook
over medium heat until all the heat has been rendered, about 8
minutes. Mix in onions, green peppers, okra, jalapeno and file. Cook
until onions have softened, about 10 minutes. Add salt, pepper and
thyme. Reduce heat to low, cook 5 minutes more. Set aside. In a
stockpot, melt the Dark Roux over medium heat; heat shrimp stock in a
medium saucepan over high heat. Gradually pour hot stock over roux,
whisking to combine well. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture
thickens, 6 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add reserved
sausage-and-vegetable mixture and tomatoes. Stir gumbo well and let
cool for 1 hour. If using whole crabs, cut them in half lengthwise
and add to gumbo. Cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp and cook 3 to 4
minutes or until opaque. Add crabmeat and parsley and cook 2 to4
minutes. Season to taste. Serve hot over Dirty Rice.
