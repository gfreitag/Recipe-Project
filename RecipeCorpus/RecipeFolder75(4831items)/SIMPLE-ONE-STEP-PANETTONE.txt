1 ts grated lemon peel

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease a clean, empty 1-pound coffee
can. Line bottom with a piece of waxed paper, cut to fit, and grease
paper. In a large bowl beat eggs and sugaruntil thick and pale
yellow, about 5 minutes. Beat in melted butter, lemon peel and
extracts. In a small bowl, mix flour, baking powder and salt and
blend into egg mixture alternately with buttermilk. Stir in almonds,
raisins and dried fruit. Pour batter into prepared can and place on a
baking sheet. Bake 55 to 60 minutes, or until bread is well browned

cake.) To serve, cut into slices or wedges. Makes 1 loaf
