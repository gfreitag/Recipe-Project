Title: SCANDINAVIAN BEET SALAD
Categories: Salads, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lg Beets, boiled
1 ts Caraway seeds
6 tb Boiling water
1 1/2 tb Vinegar
2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
The beets need to be prepared 8 hours before serving so that they
have time to absorb the flavours of the dressing. Use freshly boiled
beets & slice them thinly into a bowl. Crush the caraway seeds & pour
the water over the top.  Leave them to sit until the water has become
cold. Strain. Mix the strained liquid with the vinegar, sugar & salt.
Pour over the sliced beets. Leave to stand for 8 hours.  Before
serving, sprinkle with caraway seeds if desired.
