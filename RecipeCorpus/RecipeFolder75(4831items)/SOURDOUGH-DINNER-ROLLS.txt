Title: SOURDOUGH DINNER ROLLS
Categories: None
Yield: 36 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm potato water
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Sourdough Starter
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
4 1/2 c  To 5 all-purpose flour
Butter; melted (opt)
Dissolve yeast in potato water; let set until foamy, 5 to 10 min.
Heat milk and 1/2 c butter or margarine until just melted; cool to
lukewarm. Combine starter, yeast mixture, milk mixture, sugar and
salt. Add flour to make a stiff dough; knead until smooth and
elastic. Place in a greased bowl; turn dough to coat surface. Cover
and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until doubled, about
1 hour. Punch down dough; cover and let rest 10 minutes.  Shape into
rolls. Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm
place, free from from drafts, until doubled, about 45 minutes. If
desired, brush with melted butter or margarine before baking in a
preheated 375F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes
3 to 4 dozen.

Notes: I skipped the last optional butter step and used plain warm
water and they turned out well but did not rise too much. Take it for
what it's worth.
