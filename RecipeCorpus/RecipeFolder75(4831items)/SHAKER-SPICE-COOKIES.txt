Title: SHAKER SPICE COOKIES
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2/3 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Molasses
1    Egg
2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Ginger
1 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Put the vegetable oil, sugar, molasses and egg into a mixing bowl and
using a spoon, beat until well mixed.

Combine the flour, baking soda, cloves, ginger, cinnamon and salt in
a bowl and stir with a fork until well mixed.

Add to the liquid ingredients and stir until blended.

To make 2 1/2-inch round cookies use 1 tablespoon of dough per cookie
(I use a 1-tablespoon ice cream scoop, but you can roll the dough into
1-tablespoon-size balls by hand if you don't have a scoop.) Drop the
dough 2-inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Pat each rounded ball
down just a trifle.

Bake for 10 or 11 minutes.

Yields 48 cookies
