Title: SESAME SEEDS (KOREAN KAE)
Categories: Korean, Condiments, Ethnic
Yield: 1 Servings  A small supply of sesame seeds should be kept on hand if any korean
cooking is planned. These seeds should always be crushed and roasted.

1.  Pruchase a jar of white sesame seeds.

2.  In a heavy skillet, over a very low flame brown the seeds until
they turn dark golden. Shake the pan and stir the seeds from time to
time. If the sesame seeds have browned carefully, they will pop and
jump in the pan. Sesame seeds taste best when roasted to a dark
golden color.

3.  Allow the seeds to cool to room temperature in the pan. Crush
them with a mortar and pestle or in a blender. Crushed in either
manner, the juice from the seeds will escape. Stored in an air-tight
jar, the seeds will keep for months.
