Title: SLOW POTATOES
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
6    12Medium good quality baking
Potatoes
Pre-heat oven to 300 deg. F. Thoroughly wash and clean potatoes, and
remove any 'bad' spots. Pierce potatoes at least twice, and be sure
to penetrate to the center or beyond. Place potatoes on top oven
rack, about 3/4 way up. Bake for 4 hours. At the end of the baking
time, remove potatoes from oven, place in a bowl, and refrigerate
over night, or until completly cool/cold. Eat cold as a snack, but be
sure to try the inside by itself, I find it very good, and eat the
skin seperately.
