Title: SOURDOUGH YEAST STARTER
Categories: Breads, Pancakes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
2 c  Warm water
2 c  Flour
1. Empty yeast into mixing bowl and stir in warm water until
dissolved. Add flour and stir until well blended. Cover with
plastic wrap and allow to  stand at room temperature (or in oven
out of drafts) for at least 48 hours, or until hooch (clear liquid)
forms on top. 2. Store in refrigerator in a jar with a loose
fitting lid (I like to use
a plastic peanut butter jar) . Renew monthly by adding alternately
1  cup of water or 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of flour. 1/4 cup of
sugar may be added every other month to add to the fermentation. 3.
Always save at least one-cup of the fermented mixture to use as
on-going starter. If recipe calls for 3 cups of starter, add 3 cups
of milk (or water) and three cups of flour. Allow to stand until
clear liquid forms on top. Save 1-cup for future use and use the
extra 3 cups in the recipe.
