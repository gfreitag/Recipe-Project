For those of you with a bread machine, I guess that't all you need to
know. For everyone else:

Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 1/2 tsp sugar. Add molasses,
honey, sugar, shortening, salt, caraway seed, and orange rind. Slowly
mix in both types of flour and knead until smooth and elastic. Cover
with cloth and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in size.
Shape into a loaf and let rise for about 1 hour. Bake at 375 F about
30-40 minutes, until brown.
