Title: SALSA VERDE 3
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 3 Cups
1 1/2 lb Fresh tomatillos
2    Anaheim green chiles;
-charred, peeled, & seeded
3    Jalape#o chiles; partially
-seeded & deveined
2    Garlic clove
1/2    Chicken bouillon cube; or
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/4 c  Rice vinegar
1 tb Light oil (sunflower)
1/4 c  Cilantro; snipped
1 pn Salt
After removing the dry husks from the tomatillos, rinse them well
under warm water to remove some of the stickiness. Cut tomatillos
into quarters. Cut the Anaheim chiles and jalape#os into pieces.

To the bowl of a food processor fitted with the knife blade
attachment, add the tomatillos, chile pieces, and cloves of garlic.
Chop to a coarse pur#e using on and off pulsations. If you want to
use the salsa for dipping tostada chips or spooning onto homemade
pizzas or tortas, it is best to make a coarse puree.  For a thinner
suace consistency, pulse on your food processor for 20 seconds and
pur#e the salsa. You can further thin down the sauce by adding 1 cup
chicken broth, sour cream, or cream. Stir this liquid in during the
simmering stage. This thinner sauce is perfect for enchiladas and
tortas.

After you have pur#ed the ingredients for your salsa, place mixture
in a 3-quart saucepan.  Simmer everything except the fresh cilantro,
for 12 to 15 minutes. Place the salsa into a bowl to cool completely
before adding the cilantro.  Or store the salsa in a glass jar in the
refrig- erator for up to 2 weeks and stir a few snipped springs of
cilantro into the portion you will be serving.  Adjust seasonings,
such as salt and more cilantro, by taste testing.

This sauce is probably one of the most adaptable of all of the
salsas: it can be used for dipping tostada chips, adding zest to
quacamole, or saucing enchiladas, tortas, or homemade Mexican pizza.
