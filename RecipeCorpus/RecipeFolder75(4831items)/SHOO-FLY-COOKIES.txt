1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Boiling water
Crumb Topping:

Shoo-fly pies are not made here (Indiana) as commonly as in
Pennsylvania. However, this cookie recipe is a wonderful substitute.
It is like a tender gingerbread in a pastry crust, with a thin,
subtle layer of molasses pudding on th bottom.

Line a 2 quart rectangular glass baking dish with pastry, crimping the
dough well at the top and over the sides--you do not want it to slip
during baking. With a food processor or mixer, combine the crumb
ingredients; reserve.  Preheat the oven to 325 F.  In a medium bowl,
combine the molasses, corn syrup, salt, baking soda, and boiling
water. Pour 1/2 cup of the liquid into the pie shell and sprinkle
with one-third of the crumb mixture.  Repeat twice, ending with
crumbs. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Watch carefully in the beginning,
and if crust begins to slip down, pat it back up with a knife.  The
top will be golden.  Let cool and cut into 1-1/2 inch squares. NOTE:
If you really like molasses, use less corn syrup and increase the
molasses.
