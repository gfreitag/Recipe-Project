Title: SPAGHETTI IN OLIVE OIL SAUCE
Categories: Pastas
Yield: 4 Servings  Olive oil, about 1/2 cup per serving Sliced garlic cloves, as many as
you dare Pasta Grated parmesan and romano cheese

Warm the olive oil.  Brown the sliced garlic cloves until crispy. Let
the whole thing stay warm while cooking the pasta, then toss all
together -- quick meal. The original recipe called for discarding the
garlic slices, but we like them because they are really nice and
crunchy. Top with plenty of grated parmesan and romano cheese!

Note:  you could easily add peppers and then mushrooms at the end.
