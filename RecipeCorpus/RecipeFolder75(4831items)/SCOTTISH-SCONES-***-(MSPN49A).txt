2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
2 ts Cream of tartar
3 tb Butter; room temperature
1 ea Egg; room temp light beat
1/2 c  Buttermilk; room temperature
In bowl, mix flour, salt, baking soda and cream of tartar. Stir

Gradually stir beaten egg and buttermilk into the flour mix. If it is
a bit too moist and sticks to hands, add a bit of flour. Turn the
dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead as little as
possible to achieve a soft, pliable dough ball. Divide dough into 2
equal parts.  Flatten each with the knuckles into a round disc.
About 6" in diameter and 1/2" thick. Prick about a dozen times with
fork. Then cut in four sections each. Bake on lightly greased baking
sheet until tan. At 375 degrees for about 15 minutes. You can add 1/2
cup raisins or currants if you wish. FROM: SUSAN HOHLWEG   (MSPN49A)
