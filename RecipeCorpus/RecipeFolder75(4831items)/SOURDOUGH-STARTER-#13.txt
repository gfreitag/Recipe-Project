Title: SOURDOUGH STARTER #13
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Milk
1 c  Unbleached Flour
Let milk stand for a day or so in an uncovered container at room
temperature.  Add flour to milk and let stand for another couple of
days. When it starts working well and smells right, it is ready to
use. NOTE: All containers for starters not using yeast, must be
carefully scalded before use.  If you are carless or do not scald
them the starter will fail.
