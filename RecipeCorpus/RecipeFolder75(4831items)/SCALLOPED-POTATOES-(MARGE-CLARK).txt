Favorite standby...one of
The things that EVERYONE in
The family
Loved
3 Tbsp butter 2 Tbsp flour 1 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp pepper 3 c milk 6
mdm potatoes, pared and thinly sliced (6 c) 2 Tbsp chopped onion

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 2 qt casserole. Make a basic
white sauce of butter, flour, salt, pepper & milk. Place half the
potatoes in casserole. Cover with half the onion and half the sauce.
Repeat layers. Cover and bake about an hour. (I like to cook it a bit
longer, about 1 hour and 15 minutes before uncovering it.) Test to
make sure potatoes are almost, but not quite, fork tender. Uncover
and bake 30 minutes longer.

Left over cooked ham layered in the middle makes it almost a one dish
meal, and is a good addition...tho I usually serve this with ham to
begin with.

Serves 4-6 (the recipe says...I say 4 max!)
