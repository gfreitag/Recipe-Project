Title: SEMOLINA SESAME BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Ounces
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
2 ts Yeast
3 c  Semolina flour
3 tb Wheat germ
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
3 tb Olive oil
1/3 c  Sesame seeds; toasted
1 1/4 c  Water; warm
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Semolina flour is the strong, silent type.  It has great tear
(texture) and character, but a mild flavor that does not announce
itself. Its understated nature lets this bread go anywhere with
almost anything, alongside an assertive French or Italian sauce,
around juicy roast meat, or under ripe cheese.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments:
