Title: SAUTE OF CHICKEN BREASTS WITH COCONUT MILK AN
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Boneless -- skinless
Chicken
Breast halves, tenderloins
Separated
Salt
1 tb Oriental sesame oil
Half a lime or lemon --
Seeds removed
1/3 c  Coconut milk
1 sm Scallion (green onion) --
Trimmed and finely
Sliced
1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
Dried red pepper flakes
Between sheets of plastic wrap pound the thicker side of the breast
to make it overall more even in thickness and season lightly with
salt.

Heat the sesame oil in a skillet over moderate heat. Add the chicken
breasts and tenderloins. Saute the chicken without disturbing the
pieces for 4 to 5 minutes. You'll know to turn the chicken over when
the top looks opaque (tenderloins may take only 2 to 3 minutes per
side). Turn the chicken over to the other side and saute, undisturbed
again for another 4 to 5 minutes or until the interior is cooked
through.

Remove the chicken to a plate and discard the fat from the skillet.
Squeeze the juice from the lime into the skillet and scrape up any
coagulated juices into the juice; add the coconut milk, bring it to a
simmer. Remove the skillet from the heat and whisk in the scallions
and cilantro; season to taste with salt and dried red pepper flakes

Yield: 2 servings
