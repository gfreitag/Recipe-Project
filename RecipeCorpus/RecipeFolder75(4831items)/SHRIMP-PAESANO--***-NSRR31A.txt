Never  made this dish,  but the rumor in San Antonio is that Joe
Paesano's wife stole this prior to their divorce, she then proceeded
to give it to anyone who would take it. Don't know if that is true or
not, but here is the recipe. Pre-heat oven to 400. Soak shrimp in 1/2
& 1/2 for at least 30 minutes.   Drain and roll shrimp in flour and
saute in oil over medium heat for 5 minutes. Do not turn shrimp. Re-
move and place shrimp in baking dish, sauted side down in pre-heated
oven. Turn oven to broil and broil for 5 minutes. For sauce: Mix egg
yolk and lemon juice in half the butter and stir over low heat until
melted, take off heat. Add garlic and rest of butter and stir briskly
until butter melts and sauce thickens. (Add small amount of 1/2 & 1/2
to thicken). Add chives and parsley. That's it for instructions--I
guess common sense would tell you to pour this sauce over the shrimp
and eat it. David in San Antonio FROM: DAVID YOUNGQUIST (NSRR31A)
