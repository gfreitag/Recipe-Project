Title: SCALLOPS WITH GINGER & MINT
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
4 tb Unsalted butter
2 md Carrots; peeled
-& finely grated or shredded
1 tb Salad oil
2 lb Small bay scallops
1 tb Finely minced shallots
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
2 tb Chopped fresh mint
Salt; to taste
Freshly ground pepper
- to taste
IN A SMALL LIDDED POT or saucepan melt 2 tablespoons butter over low
heat and add the carrots. Cover and cook slowly for about 15 minutes,
or until softened. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over
high heat. Pat the scallops dry on a towel. When the oil is nearly
smoking, toss in the scallops, in batches if necessary so as not to
crowd the pan, and cook for 30 seconds without stirring. Then stir
lightly with a wooden spoon and cook an additional minute. Using a
slotted spoon remove the scallops from the pan. Reserve scallops on a
plate. They should be only partially cooked. Discard the oil in the
pan. Return the skillet to high heat, add the shallots, wine and
ginger. Cook until liquid reduces by half. Meanwhile, the scallops
will have released a small amount of liquid. Pour this into the pan,
reduce heat to low and cook until almost no liquid remains. Return
scallops to the pan, whisk in remaining butter and add the mint.
Immediately remove from the heat. Taste for salt and pepper. To
serve, make a ring of carrots on a platter and mound the sauced
scallops in the center.
