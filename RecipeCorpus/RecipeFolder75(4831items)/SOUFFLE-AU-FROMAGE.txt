cook until mixture foams.Use a whisk to beat in the milk and bring
the sauce to a boil, stirring constantly.Add salt,pepper and
mustard.Cook 2 minutes.Remove from heat and beat in egg yolks one at
a time,beating well after each addition.Cool slightly,then beat in
cup grated cheese.(This can be done in advance.Lay a piece of plastic
wrap directly on the mixture to keep it from forming a skin.If you
refrigerate the mixture,warm it gently and beat well before
continuing.) Heat oven to 400 degrees.Heat the cheese mixture until
hot to the touch.Whip the egg whites until they barely hold stiff
peaks.Add a quarter of the egg whites to the cheese mixture.Stir
gently to blend completely.Add this to remaining egg whites and fold
quickly and gently.pour mixture into prepared souffle dish and
sprinkle with 1 tbsp. cheese. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until souffle
is puffed and brown.If it browns too rapidly,place a sheet of
lightweight aluminum foil directly on top.
