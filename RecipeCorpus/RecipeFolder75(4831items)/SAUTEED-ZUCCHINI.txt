2 lb Zucchini
2 ts Salt
1/2 sm Onion; finely chopped
4 tb Butter
Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Lemon juice
3 tb Parsley; chopped
Salt; if needed
Scrub zucchini and cut off ends.  Grate and put in colander. Toss
with 2 tsp salt and let drain at least 1/2 hour. When ready to cook,
drain well in a paper towel to remove all liquid. Melt butter in a
large skillet. Saute onion over low heat until soft.  Raise heat to
medium high and add zucchini.  Stir and toss constantly for 3-4
minutes, until cooked but still crisp.  Season with pepper, salt if
needed, lemon juice and parsley. Serve immediately.
