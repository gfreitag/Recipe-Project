Title: SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH HAM
Categories: Petfood
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Egg
1    Slice ham, finely chopped
2 tb Grated cheese
Splash of milk
Beat the eggs; then add the chopped ham and grated cheese. Add a
splash of milk (this makes scrambled eggs fluffy). Pour into skillet
and gently scramble until thoroughly cooked. Cool to room temperature
(takes about 10 minutes) and serve.  Note:  Cats should always be fed
cooked eggs, not raw, because raw egg whites interfere with the
absorption of biotin, one of the B vitamins. Raw eggs also carry the
danger of salmonella poisoning. Feed cooked eggs no more than twice a
week. Typed in MMFormat by cjhartlin@msn.com  Source: Cat Treats
