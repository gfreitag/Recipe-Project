Title: SEAFOOD QUESDILLA & SALSA
Categories: Seafood, Sandwiches
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Whole wheat tortilla
1 tb Salsa (see recipe below)
1/4 c  Cooked flaked crab meat
Or 5 cooked medium shrimp,
Sliced
1 oz Shredded Jack cheese
2 tb Canned, diced green chiles
MMMMM---------------------------SALSA--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Diced tomatoes
1 tb Chopped cilantro*
1/4 c  Chopped green onions
1/4 c  Chopped, mild chile
2 tb Fresh lime juice
Salt & pepper to taste
In small bowl combine all ingredients for salsa. Cover tortilla with
salsa. On half of tortilla spread seafood, cheese and chiles. Fold
tortilla in half to enclose filling. Cook in non-stick skillet, or
place under broiler until cheese is hot and bubbly.  Turn tortilla to
brown both sides. Cut into 4 wedges. (It looks like more food!) Serve
with extra salsa if desired.

NOTE:  If you prefer, omit the seafood and count just 1 meat card for
the cheese.  Also, if you prefer, choose a low-fat cheese. This will
let you omit the fat card. Work with these recipes so that they can
work in the best way possible for you.

*Freebie:  Cilantro is know as Coriander in some parts of the
country. It is an acquired taste, so if you don't care for it,
substitute parsley. If you haven't tried it, give it a chance. It
adds a lot of flavor to a dish.
