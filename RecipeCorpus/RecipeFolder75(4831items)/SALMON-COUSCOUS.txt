[If you do not have a couscousier in which to cook this recipe,
improvise by using a saucepan and colander. Line the colander with a
muslin cloth, allowing the sides of the cloth to hang over the edge.
Roll up the hanging muslin to make a collar around the edge of the
colander. During the method, the base of the couscousier is
equivalent to the saucepan and the top to the lined colander.]

Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Set aside.

Soak the couscous for 20 minutes in a large bowl of hot water. Heat
the oil in the base of the couscousier, stir in the garlic, chilli
pepper, caraway seeds, onion, courgette, carrot and pepper. Cook
gently for 5 minutes. Add the salmon juice and stock to the
vegetables. Put the top of the couscousier on and place the soaked
couscous into it. Season with salt. Cover with a lid and steam for 30
minutes.

Remove the top of the couscousier and add the tomatoes and salmon.
Heat for 5 minutes. Place the couscous onto a large serving plate and
gently stir in the margarine and the pumpkin seeds. Pile the salmon
alongside to serve.
