6    Salmon steaks; 1 3/4" thick
2 tb Butter
2    Limes
Fresh ground pepper
1    Apple

Prepare the fruit by thinly slicing the lime, including the ends.
Halve and core the apple and pear and cut into thin slices, about
1/8".

In a large skillet, at a low heat, melt the butter and sprinkle with
pepper.  Add the lime slices, turning to coat them with butter. Add
apple and pear and saute' until butter is absorbed by the fruit,
about 5 minutes. Fruit should be tender, but not browned.

Place salmon steaks on the grill.  Remove the lime ends from the
sauteed fruit and rub over salmon, simultaneously squeezing juice.
Broil about 5 inches from the heat until brown, about 7 minutes. Turn
and repeat on the other side.  Carefully remove steaks.

Serve immediately with sauteed fruit complimented with Brown Rice
Milanese and green beans with mushroom and sesame seeds.

Serves 6.
