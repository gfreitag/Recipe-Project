BRING THE BROTH TO A SIMMER in a pot and add the ham, bean curd and
mushrooms. Let it simmer 5 minutes. Heat the oil in a wok to very hot
(about 380F). Test the oil by dropping a small piece of Rice Crust
into it. It should float immediately. Slip the whole Rice Crust into
the oil. As it begins to puff up like popcorn, break it up into large
chunks with long chopsticks. Turn it to brown on all sides (about 1
minute). Remove the rice and drain it. At the table, add the rice to
the serving bowl of soup. It will sizzle as the steam rises and
provide quite a show. Add the scallions and sesame oil just before
serving. (The oil used for deep-frying can be cooled, strained
through a fine sieve and stored in a jar for future use.)

FOR RICE CRUST: Prepare rice as you normally would, but cook it in a
wide, heavy pot at least 15 minutes after the rice is soft so that a
crust forms on the bottom of the pot. Spoon off the top layer of
loose rice and set aside for Fried Rice or freeze it for future use.
If left to stand overnight at room temperature, the crust will be
easier to remove from the pot. To use the rice right away, keep the
pot on low heat and dribble peanut oil around the edge. Heat for a
few minutes, then loosen the crust with a spatula. It should come out
in one whole piece. Invert the crust onto a plate. It can now be
frozen for future use or used while still hot.
