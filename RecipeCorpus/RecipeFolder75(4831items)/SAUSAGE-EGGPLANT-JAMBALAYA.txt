Title: SAUSAGE EGGPLANT JAMBALAYA
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4 tb Oil
4 md Eggplants
1 lg Onion
1/2    Bell pepper
Salt and pepper
1    Stalk celery
2    Cloves garlic
2 1/2 c  Uncooked rice
2 1/2 c  Water
1/2 lb Fresh pork sausage
1/2 lb Smoked sausage
In a large dutch oven, saute chopped onion, bell pepper, celery, and
garlic in oil until wilted.  Peel and chop eggplant and add this plus
the sausage (chopped in small pieces) to the wilted vegetables. When
eggplant is well-smothered, add salt and pepper to taste. (This
should be a peppery dish, so don't spare the seasoning.) Add the rice
and water next. Cover and cook until rice is tender (about 25-30
minutes) over low heat.
