Title: SKILLET CHICKEN DINNER FOR 2
Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
1 tb Salad oil
2 md Onions, sliced 1/2"
2 ts Flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Rosemary, dry crushed
1/2 ts Black pepper
4 lg Chicken thighs (1 1/2 lb)
1/2 lb Small red potatoes or 1 lge
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 bn Spinach, chopped, no stems
1/4 c  Pitted ripe olives, sliced
About 40 minutes before serving:

In a 10 inch skillet (non-stick sauce pan for 1 serving) over
medium-high heat, heat the oil then add onions and cook until soft
and golden brown. Remove onions to a bowl and set aside.

On a sheet of waxed paper, mix the flour, salt, rosemary and pepper,
blending well.  Coat each piece of chicken. Cook the chicken pieces
over medium high heat in the remaining oil until golden brown on all
sides.

Add the potatoes, lemon juice, cooked onions and 1/4 cup of water to
the chicken in the skillet.  Do not reduce the liquid for one serving
or the pot is likely to boil dry. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat,
cover and simmer for 20 min or until the chicken and potatoes are
fork tender. The juices of the chicken will run clear when pierced
with a knife.

Stir in the spinach and olives, cooking until the spinach is just
wilted.
