Title: SAFFRON KULFI POPS
Categories: Indian, Ice cream, Ethnic, Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 qt Whole milk
1/3 c  Sugar
1/16 ts Powdered saffron
-OR
1/8 ts Saffron threads
1 tb Boiling water
8    Paper cups
-OR
Cooking parchment
-OR
Waxed paper
8    Ice cream sticks (opt)
In a 6-8 quart pan over high heat, stir milk and sugar until
simmering. Over medium-high heat, boil until reduced to 2 cups, 25-35
minutes, stirring often; slide pan partially off heat if milk
threaten to boil over. Let cool; to speed cooling, set pan in ice
water.

Place saffron in a small bowl. Add boiling water, stir, and let stand
for 5 minutes. Break up threads with a small spoon. Scrape mixture
into warm reduced milk mixture.

Set paper cups in a rimmed pan. Or, to make cones, cut 8 pieces of
parchment or waxed paper into 7-1/2" squares. Fold each piece in half
to make a triangle. With long edge toward you, bring 1 of the 45'
angles to the top of the triangle, then roll toward other angle. To
close hole at bottom, starting from the top, press 1 inside sheet to
tyhe opposite side. Tape the cone in a few places to hold it
together. Support each cone, pointed end down, in a cup slightly
taller than the cone; set cups in a rimmed pan.

Divide milk mixture among cups or cones. Freeze until kulfi is thick
but not hard, 1 to 1-1/2 hours; then, if desired, push an ice cream
stick into each container. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours longer.
To eat, peel off paper. To store, seal kjulfi (still in cups or
cones) in a parge plastic bag; freeze for up to 2 weeks.
