Title: SIK SIK WE'T (BEEF STEW IN RED PEPPER SAUCE)
Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Onions -- finely chopped
1/3 c  Niter kebbeh
2 c  Garlic -- finely chopped
2 ts Fresh ginger root -- scraped
Fine choppe
1/4 ts Fenugreek seeds -- freshly
Ground
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1/8 ts Ground allspice
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg -- freshly
Grated
1/4 c  Paprika
2 ts Berbere or awaze
2/3 c  Dry red wine
1/2 c  Water
1 lg Firm ripe tomato *
2 ts Salt
3 lb Lean boneless beef **
Freshly ground black pepper
* coarsely chopped and pureed through a food mill or rubbed through a
sieve with a spoon. ** preferably chuck, trimmed of excess fat and
cut into 1-inch cubes.

In a heavy 4-5 qt. enameled casserole, cook the onions over moderate
heat for 5-6 minutes, until they are soft and dry. Slide the
casserole back and forth over the heat and stir the onions constantly
to prevent them from burning; if necessary, reduce the heat or remove
the casserole from the stove occasionally to let it cool for a few
moments before returning it to the heat.  Stir in the niter kebbeh
and when it begins to splutter, add the garlic, ginger, fenugreek,
cloves, allspice and nutmeg, stirring well after each addition. Add
the paprika and berbere, and stir over low heat for 2-3 minutes.

Stir in the wine, water, pureed tomato and salt, and bring the liquid
to a boil.  Add the beef cubes and turn them about with a spoon until
they are evenly coated with the sauce. Then reduce the heat to low.
Cover the pan partially and simmer the beef for about 1 1/2 hrs, or
until it shows no resistance when pierced with a few grindings of
pepper and taste for seasoning.

To serve, transfer the entire contents of the casserole to a deep
heated platter or bowl.  Sik sik wat is traditionally accompanied by
injera or spice bread, but may also be eaten with Arab-style flat
bread or hot boiled rice.  Yegomen kitfo and/or plain yoghurt may be
served with the wat from separate bowls.
