Title: SOUR LENTIL SOUP
Categories: Soups/stews
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 l  Brown lentils
2 l  Water
1/4 l  Finely chopped spring onions
1    Garlic clove (opt.); crushed
1/2 dl Finely chopped coriander *
3/4 dl Olive oil
1/2 dl Cold water
1 tb Flour
1/2 dl Vinegar (or to taste)
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
*Note: Finely chopped parsley may be substituted for coriander leaves.

Wash lentils in several changes of cold water, or place in a sieve
and run water through them.  Drain.

Put lentils in a large pot with 8 cups water, spring onion, garlic if
used, oil and coriander or parsley (or a combination of the two if
preferred). Bring to the boil, cover pan and simmer on low heat for 1
hour or until lentils are soft.

Put water and flour in a screw top jar, seal and shake until
thoroughly combined.  This prevents lumps forming. Pour this
gradually into boiling soup, stirring constantly, until thickened
slightly. Add vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.  Return to the
boil, boil gently for 5 minutes, then serve hot.
