Title: SALT-ENCRUSTED RIBEYE ROAST
Categories: Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Box; (3-pound) coarse kosher
-salt
1 1/4 c  Water
4    To 6lb well-trimmed beef
-ribeye roast; small end
1 tb Oil
2 ts To 3 ts Cracked blk. pepper
Preheat oven to 425 F. Line a shallow roasting pan with heavy-duty
aluminum foil. Combine salt and water; mix well. (Mixture may appear
dry but do not add more water.) In roasting pan, pat 1 1/2 cups salt
mixture into rectangular shape, approximately 1/2 to 1 inch larger
than the size of the roast. Brush the roast with oil; press pepper
evenly into surface. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer into thickest
part of roast, not resting in fat; center roast on salt layer.
Starting at the base of the roast, pack remaining salt mixture onto
sides and top of roast to encase roast in salt. (Some salt may fall
off, exposing small areas of the roast; this will not affect
cooking.) Do not add water or cover pan. Roast approximately 1 1/2 to
1 3/4 hours for medium rare, 1 3/4 to 2 hours for medium doneness.
Remove from oven when meat thermometer registers 130 F for
medium-rare, 145 F for medium. Remove pan with roast to cooling rack;
let stand 10 to 15 minutes. (Internal temperature will continue to
rise.) Remove and discard salt crust from roast, brushing away all
salt. Carve roast into 1/2-inch thick slices. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
Note: Salt crust should be slightly thicker at the base of the roast
than at the top. For easier packing of salt onto vertical surfaces,
use one hand to hold the salt crust in place while using the other
hand to pack on additional salt to cover. Salt crust should be
applied to roast just before roasting. A small amount of liquid may
collect in the bottom of the roasting pan during cooking.
