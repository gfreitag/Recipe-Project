CUTTING THE FISH: There are 4 basic cuts for Sashimi. A Very sharp,
heavy knife is a must. 1.  Hara Giri (Flat Cut)  Most popular cut.
Suitable for any filleted fish.  Holding the fish firmly, cut
straight down in slices about 1/4" to 1/2" thick and 1" wide,
depending on the size of the fillet.

2.  Kaku Giri (Cubic Cut)  This style of cutting is more often used
for tunny fish.  Cut the fish as above, the cut the slices into 1/2"
cubes.

3. Ito Zukuri (Thread Shape)  Although this technique may be used
with any small fish, it is especially suitable for squid. Cut the
squid straight down into 1/4" slices, the cut lengthways into 1/4"
wide strips.

4.  Usu Zukuri (Paper Thin Slices)  Place a fillet of bass or bream
on a flat surface and, holding the fish firmly with one hand, slice
it at an angle into almost transparent sheets.

TO SERVE: Sashimi may be composed of one fish or a variety of fish. To
serve as part of a meal, arrange the fish attractively on individual
serving plates.  Garnish each plate with obout 1/2 teaspoon of wasabi
and decorate with strips of daikon, carrot and/or celery. Cover with
a sheet of plastic and refrigerate for NO MORE THAN 1 HOUR before
serving.
Pour the dipping sauce of your choice into tiny dishes and
accompany each serving of Sahshimi with it's own sauce. The wasabi
may be mixed with soy sauce or tosa joyu to taste. To serve as an
hors d' oerve, arrange two or more varieties or cuts of sashimi on a
serving dish and accompany with dipping sauce.
