If your recipe contains Munich or Crystal Malt, place the cracked or
ground grain in a kitchen pan, cover with water, heat to
approximately 150F (66 C), cover & let stand (either on the stove top
or in the oven) 45 minutes to 1 hour before you're actually ready to
start to work. Place a colander over your boiling kettle (pot) & pour
in the grain, letting the water collect in the pot below. Rinse
through the grain with hot water, at least 130 degrees F (54 C) but
no hotter than 170F (77 C) until a clear runoff is obtained. Discard
the grain. The liquid becomes part of the boil. Thoroughly dissolve
the following; Dry Malt, any sugar EXCEPT the priming sugar (used for
bottling), Dextrin Powder, Gypsum and Salt in two or more gallons of
water (as much as possible). Heat to a rolling boil. Stir in the
Bittering Hops along with the Chocolate Malt and boil 30 minutes
more, adding Aromatic Hops during the last two minutes. (If you are
using hop pellets, you may 'dry hop', adding the pellets to the
fermenter just proir to fermentation instead of putting them in the
boiling kettle.) At the end of the boil, the wort should be cooled as
quickly as possible to a temperature between 70 and 85 degrees F
(21-27 C), so the yeast can be added.(If you wish measure starting
specific gravity) Fermentation: Siphon your cooled wort into one or
more sanitized glass jugs (or fermentors), filling no more than 2/3
full. (Anne's note the total amount of liquid should be 5 American
gallons.) Add the yeast, attach a airlock to each container and allow
fermentation to proceed. In 5 to 7 days, when apparent yeast activity
has ceased and it taste like dry, flat beer, you are ready to bottle.
Siphon beer carefully into secondary container, do not disturb
sediment. (Anne's note: if this is done TWICE, the second time a day
or so later, there will be almost no sediment in the beer.) Boil
priming sugar and stir in carefully. Siphon primed beer into clean
bottles and cap (allow some headspace.) Check ales after week or two.
(We've found that they are most drinkable after 3 weeks.) MAKES: 5 US
gallons
