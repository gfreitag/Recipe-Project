Title: SOURDOUGH NEPALESE BREAD
Categories: Breads, Sourdough
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter sponge*
2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cloves, ground
1    Egg, slightly
-beaten
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
In sourdough starter put the beaten egg and the 1/2 cup milk. Sift
all the dry ingredients together; add to the starter mixture. Work
until the dough forms a smooth ball. Add more flour if needed. Dough
should not be sticky, but should be soft.  Cover and let rise for 1/2
hour or so. Divide into 4 equal parts.  Shape each into a ball. On a
lightly floured board, roll out each ball into an 8-inch circle. Cut
into quarters. Heat 1 1/2 inches of salad oil in a heavy skillet at
400F.  Lower 1 portion of dough at a time into the hot oil; as soon
as it returns to the surface, immediately turn over, using a slotted
spatula. Continue to cook for 2 minutes or until puffed and golden
brown.  Lift out and drain on paper towels. Serve warm. Good with
lamb stew.

* Take your Mother Reserve out of refrigerator the night before, mix
1 1/2 cups water, 1 1/2 cups flour and the Mother Reserve and 1
tablespoon sugar. Cover and let set overnight. Next morning take your
Mother Reserve back out, and after taking out what you use in the
recipe, sprinkle the reserve with a dash of sugar and return to the
refrigerator for future use.
