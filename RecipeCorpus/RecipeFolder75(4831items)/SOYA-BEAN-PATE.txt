Categories: Appetizers, Spreads, Dips, Vegetarian, Mark's
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Soya beans, soaked
1 md Onion, finely chopped
1 tb Olive oil
2 tb Tomato paste
2 tb Black olives, pitted &
-- chopped
2 tb Parsley, chopped
1 pn Salt
1 tb Sesame seeds, lightly
-- toasted
Drain the beans, cover with fresh water & bring to a boil. Boil hard
for 10 minutes, reduce heat, cover & simmer until tender, about 2
hours, depending on the age of the beans. Drain & set aside. When
cooled, mash.

Heat olive oil & saute the onions until very soft, 10 minutes. Add to
the mashed soya beans.  Stir in the tomato paste, olives, parsley,
salt if necessary (remember that the olives already add a salty
flavour to the rest of the ingredients) & sesame seeds.

Spoon into a serving dish & chill for at least 30 minutes before
serving. Serve with crackers or toast sliced into fingers.
