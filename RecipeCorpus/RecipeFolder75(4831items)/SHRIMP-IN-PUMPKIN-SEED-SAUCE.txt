place shrimp in enough water to cover them. Add salt, peppercorns and
bayleaf. Simmer about 3 min. until shrimp turn pink. Remove shrimp,
let cool, then shell and devein.  (Shrimp will be more tender and
flavorful if cooked in their shells).

In a skillet, toast seeds until they start to pop. Add clam juice,
cilantro, chiles, onion and seeds to blender.

Puree until smooth. Melt butter in skillet and add sauce. Cook over
low heat 10 min. Stir in shrimp. Remove from heat and add sour cream.
