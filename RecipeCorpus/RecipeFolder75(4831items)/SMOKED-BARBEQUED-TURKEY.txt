Title: SMOKED BARBEQUED TURKEY
Categories: Poultry, Marinades
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Turkey, 8-10 lbs
1/2 c  Salt
1/2 c  Sugar
1 qt Apple juice
1 tb Rosemary
1 tb Basil
1 ea Honey, for basting
Place turkey in brine for 8-12 hours.  Remove from brine. Rinse well
and air dry.  Place turkey in the smoker with both upper and lower
cavities open to expose the insides to smoke. Smoke 3-3 1/2 hours or
longer being careful not to dry bird out.

Remove turkey from the smoker and cook in your favorite way. If you
desire more smoke flavor, simply increase smoking time and the amount
of fuel used. Reduce your cooking time by 10% for each hour in the
smoker (up to 40%).

If you are using a smoker/barbeque/roaster type of barbeque, switch
modes to roast mode and baste the turkey with honey during the
roasting time.
