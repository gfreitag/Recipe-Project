put mixture into refrigerator to marinate up to 1 hour, turning bag

tablespoons soy sauce, ginger root and Tabasco or other hot sauce.
Blend and put into refrigerator to chill. 3. Cook vermicelli to
desired doneness. Add the pea pods and carrots during last 2 minutes
of cooking. Drain and immediately rinse with cold water. Put into
large bowl. Pour the dressing over vermicelli mixture, add the green
onions (slice into thin rounds, tops included). Set aside while
preparing pork. 4. Remove the pork from refrigerator and put into a
wok or large heavy skillet. Include some of the marinade. Stir pork
strips until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Drain and
add to the salad mixture. Mix the salad well. Cover and refrigerate 1
hour to allow the flavors to blend. If desired, sprinkle with toasted
sesame seeds just before serving.
