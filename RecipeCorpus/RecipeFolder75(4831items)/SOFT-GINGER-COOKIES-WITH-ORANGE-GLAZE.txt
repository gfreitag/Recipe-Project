In a small bowl combine buttermilk and baking soda and set aside.
They will foam up. In a larger bowl combine oil, sugar,molasses and
eggs and beat until well mixed (about 1 minute). Add the buttermilk
mixture and blend. Sift together dry ingredients. Slowly add dry
ingredients to wet mixture. Let mixture stand 15 minutes.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Drop batter by heaping tablespoons onto
oiled cookie sheet. Bake 8 to 9 minutes until the top springs back
when touched with your finger. Do Not overbake. The cookies should be
quite soft.

While cookies are baking combine glaze ingredients. Remove cookies to
wax paper lined wire rack. Frost while warm with 1/2 tsp of glaze for
each cookie. Let cool completely. Transfer to trays and place in
freezer to completely set if neccesary or to freeze for storage. Once
frozen pack in tins in single layers seperated by wax paper. These
freeze well.
