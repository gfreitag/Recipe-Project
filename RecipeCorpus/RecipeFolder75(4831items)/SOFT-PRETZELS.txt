Categories: Breads
Yield: 18 Pretzels
1 pk Dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water; (105 to 115)
4 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 ts Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
1    Egg white

-be substituted)
Mustard; (opt.)
Dissolve yeast in warm water.  combine flour, sugar, and salt; add
yeast mixture, and mix until well blended. Turn out onto a lighlty
floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 mintues).

Using kitchen shears dipped in flour, cut dough into 18 pieces; roll
each into a ball.

With floured hands, roll each ball between your hands to form a rope
about 14 to 16 inches long and about 1/2 inch in diameter; twist each
into a pretzel shape, and place on a lightly greased baking sheet.

Beat egg white until frothy, and brush on each pretzel; sprinkle with
salt. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
Serve warm or cold with mustard, if desired.

NOTE: Serve as a snack with mustard, or seve them in place of bread
with a main-dish salad.
