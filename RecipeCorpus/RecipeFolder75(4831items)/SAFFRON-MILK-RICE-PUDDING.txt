Rinse the rice in cold water and drain thoroughly.  Warm 1 tablespoon

medium heat, cook rice with the soaked saffron, remaining milk, water
and spices for 25 minutes, or until rice is tender. Reduce heat to
low, add sugar and cook 15 minutes longer, or until the mixture
blends and thickens. Remove pudding from the heat and cool. Add rose
water, stir well and refrigerate until well chilled. Just before
serving, melt shortening in a skillet over medium heat and saute
cashews and raisins until cashews are golden. Remove pudding from the
refrigerator. If it is too thick, thin it with up to 1/4 cup cold
milk.  Stir in cashews and raisins. Spoon into dessert bowls. Garnish
each serving with a circle of sliced almonds and a sprinkle of
chopped pistachios in the center.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
