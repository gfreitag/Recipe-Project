Title: SIMPLE SALAD
Categories: Salads, Low fat, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Zucchini diced
2    Yellow squash diced
3    Green onions diced
2    Roma tomatoes diced
1/4 c  Sun-dried tomatoes diced
(not oil soaked ofcourse)
3 tb Cider vinegar
1/2 ts Oregano (I used dry but
Fresh would be better
Salt and Pepper to taste.
Mix everything together.  This is suppose to be eaten plain like a
salad, but I put it on some pasta and tried it on rice too, and liked
it like that.
