Title: SPARERIBS WITH SAUERKRAUT
Categories: Pork, German
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Spareribs; cut into pieces
3 1/2 c  Sauerkraut
2    Carrots; grated
1 1/2 c  Tomato juice
2 tb Brown sugar
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1    Apple; chopped
2 tb Caraway seeds
Season ribs with salt and pepper. Combine sauerkraut with remaining
ingredients. Place ribs on top of kraut in flat baking pan. Bake,
covered, at 400 to 450 degrees 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. (I bake ribs
first at 350 degrees 15 minutes to remove excess grease and juices.)
