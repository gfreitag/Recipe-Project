Mash the avocado with the rind and juice of the lime, stir into the
salmon then add the tomatoes, cheese, chillies and yogurt. Mix well
but try to keep the texture quite rough. Season to taste then serve
with the suggested accompaniments.

Cook's Note: To make oven-baked potato skins, bake 4 large potatoes
until the centers are soft. Cut them in half and scoop out the potato
pulp, reserving this for another recipe. Slice the skins into 3 or 4
strips and brush very liberally with olive or vegetable oil. Sprinkle
with salt and bake in a pre-heated oven 200C, 400F, Gas mark 6 for
6-10 minutes or until well crisped. These are best served hot.
