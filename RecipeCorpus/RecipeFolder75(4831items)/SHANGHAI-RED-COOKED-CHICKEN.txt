Red-cooking is a form of stewing with a seasoned liquid containing soy
sauce and spices.

If serving more people, get more chickens. Chickens should not exceed
about 4 lbs. each.

Marinating:  Wash chicken thoroughly under cool water: dry. Cut off
fat pockets around cavity opening. Place chicken in snug bowl.Brush
or rub dark soy sauce into skin; let stand in bowl for 30 minutes;
repeat brushing several times.  Remove from bowl.

Braising:  In wok heat oil for braising under medium high flame.When
oil is hot, but not smoking, quickly lower chicken into oil. Protect
yourself against splattering oil by holding wok lid over wok; don't
actually cover it.  Using large spoon, baste chicken with hot oil, &
turn once or twice so skin browns evenly (about 10-15 minutes).
Carefully remove chicken from wok, trying not to break skin.

Stewing:  Chop green onions into 2" sections.  Heat peanut oil in
heavy pot or dutch oven, in which chicken will fit snugly. When oil
is hot, add green onions & ginger.  Saute until onions are lightly
brown. Add water, sherry, thin soy, star anise & salt. Bring mixture
to boil.While liquid is heating, loosely tie legs of chicken together
with a piece of twine. Lower chicken into boiling liquid.

Bring liquid to boil again, then reduce heat for very slow simmer.
Chicken should actually be floating free in liquid. Cover & simmer
for about 1 hour or until chicken is very tender. Leave chicken in
covered pot until 5 minutes before serving.  Then remove it carefully
to serving platter; remove twine.  Remove all but 1 cup of liquid
from pot (including onion pieces). Bring liquid to boil; thicken
slightly with cornstarch paste; glaze with sesame oil. Pour sauce
over chicken & serve.
