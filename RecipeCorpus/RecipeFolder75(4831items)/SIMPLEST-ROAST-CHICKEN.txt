Title: SIMPLEST ROAST CHICKEN
Categories: Miamiherald, Meat/poul
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Chicken (5-6lb); wing tips
-removed
1    Lemon; halved
4    Whole garlic cloves
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 c  Chicken broth, water, fruit
-juice or wine
Place oven rack on second level from bottom.  Heat oven to 500
degrees F. Remve the fat from the tail and crop end of the chicken.
Discard the neck and giblets or freeze for making chicken stock
later. Reserve chicken livers for another use. Stuff the cavity of
the chicken with the lemon, garlic and butter(if using). Season the
cavity and skin with salt and pepper. Place chicken in a 12-by-8-by-1
1/2-inch roasting pan, breast side up. Put in oven legs first and
roast 50 -60 minutes, or until juices run clear. After the first 10
minutes, move the chicken with a wooden spatula to keep it from
sticking. Remove the chicken to a platter by placing a large wooden
spoon into the tail and balancing the chicken with a kitchen spoon
pressed against the crop end.  As you lift the chicken, tilt it over
the roasting pan so that all the juices run out of the cavity and
into the pan. Pour off excess fat from the pan and put the pan on top
of the stove. Add the stock or other liquid and bring to a boil,
scraping the bottom vigorously with a wooden spoon. Let reduce by
half. Serve the sauce over the chicken or, for crisp skin, in a sauce
boat.
