1 1/8 c  Sourdough starter
1/2 c  Water
1 1/4 ts Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
2 1/4 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 ts Yeast
This is for the medium sized loaf which, depending on how active my
starter is at the moment, will rise to the top of my Hitachi B101.

If I want an extra sour loaf, I will use the starter two or three days
after feeding. This produces a shorter loaf with a heavier texture.

For a light and fluffy loaf, I feed the starter first, then let it
sit on the counter for 8 to 10 hours before using. I make sure it is
very foamy when I put it in the B/M.
