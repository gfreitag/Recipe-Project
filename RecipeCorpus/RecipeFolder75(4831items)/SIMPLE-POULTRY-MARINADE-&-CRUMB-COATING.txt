Child "The Way To Cook" - Page 99 To Coat Food in Bread Crumbs:

"A coating of fresh white bread crumbs and a saute of real butter
make a delicious salmon steak or chicken breast, or can give a bland
fish or meat an interesting new dimension. In addition, crumbing
gives more solidity to fish otherwise too flimsy or foods otherwsie
to soft for a regualr saute. . .Fresh crumbs and real butter make all
the difference". Crumbing the food: "Wisk together the eggs, oil and
salt in a 9-inch pie plate. One at a time, dip first in flour and
shake off excess, then in beaten egg and shake of excess.  Set in the
crumbs, tossing them over the food and patting them in place.  Lay
each piece as done on a baking sheet covered with wax paper; when all
re crumbed, cover and refrigerate 20 minutes or longer, so the crumbs
will set".
