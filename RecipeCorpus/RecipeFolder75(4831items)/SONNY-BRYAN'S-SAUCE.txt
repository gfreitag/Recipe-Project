28 oz Crushed tomatoes
1 1/2 c  Ketchup

Sautee onion until golden. Add garlic for one minute. Add remaining

Hmm... I would replace the water with a nice malty beer. Paulaner
Oktoberfest or Dos Equiis. And use a couple of chipotles in adobo
instead of liquid smoke. They use the jock straps of the volunteer
fire department to make that stuff.
