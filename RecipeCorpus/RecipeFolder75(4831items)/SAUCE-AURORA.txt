Title: SAUCE AURORA
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 60 Cl
120 g  Butter
4 tb Flour
1 1/4 l  Chicken or veal stock
10 cl Tomato paste
Cream
Melt 60 grms of butter on a small saucepan on low-heat. Add the flour
and stir, to make a roux, cooking for 1 or 2 minutes. Always
stirring, add the stock to the mix, raise the heat until the sauce
starts to boil, low the heat and put half of the saucepan in which
the sauce is cooking, off the heat in order to cook the liquid very
slowly on one side of the pan.
With a spoon take out very carefully  all the solids that come up on
the cooler side. Cook for at least 45 minutes. Mix with enough cream
to obtain the desired consistency. Remove from heat and add the
tomato paste and the remaining butter mixing well. Serve immediately.
It goes very well with vegetables, fish or chicken.
