Title: SOUR DOUGH WAFFLES OR PANCAKES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------WAFFLE STARTER----------------------------
1 c  Sourdough starter
1 1/2 c  Milk, warmed
1/2 c  Graham flour (they come out
-just fine using all white
-flour too)
1/4 lb Butter, melted
1 ts Salt
1 c  Flour
1 ts Sugar
MMMMM----------------------WAFFLE FINISHER---------------------------
2    Eggs beaten
1/4 ts Baking soda
The night before breakfast, combine Waffle Starter ingredients in non-
reactive bowl such as wood or plastic and mix with wooden spoon. Beat
until smooth. Use a large bowl as this will double in size. Cover
with plastic wrap. Replenish starter with a cup of water and a cup of
flour. Cover starter. Allow both to sit overnight at room
temperature. To make waffles the next morning: Preheat oven on very
low temp. Warm the waffle iron, warm the plates in the oven. Beat
eggs and add eggs and baking soda to the Waffle Starter. The Waffle
Starter should be full of bubbles and have a sourdough smell by now.
It may have collapsed and look odd. That's ok. Lighlty oil or butter
the waffle iron when ready and pour in batter. Do not spread with a
spoon. Let the batter flow to its own height. The batter should be
neither stiff nor watery. It should pour smoothly and easily. Allow
these to cook well, until golden brown, just a tad (30 seconds or a
minute) past when you see the steam stop coming from the waffle
maker. They will be nice and crisp yet  not crunchy. Delicious!
******************************** Hint: The batter will keep a day or
two in the fridge, well covered. These also freeze well to make the
best homemade 'eggo's type frozen waffles ever!
******************************** For pancakes, reduce butter to 4
Tbs, or substitute 1/4 cup corn oil. ********************************
As with any sourdough recipe, this lives and dies with the sourdough
starter. The better the starter the better the end result. Still, the
first time I made these I knew this was the recipe I had been looking
for. Our cold Alaskan winters make a nice hot Saturday breakfast a
warm and cozy start before facing the crackling cold air. These are
guaranteed to be light and crispy with a flavorful sourdough tang.
