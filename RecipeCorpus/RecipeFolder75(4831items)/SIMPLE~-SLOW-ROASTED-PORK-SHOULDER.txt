Slow roasting results in tender, juicy pork. Turkey, lamb, beef or
veal can be roasted similarly. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Oil or butter
pork all over. Season fatty outer layer with salt and pepper. Place
pork on a roasting rack in a pan. Place pan in center of preheated
oven and roast, uncovered. Roast for 30 minutes per pound or until
the internal temperature at the thickest point reaches 155F. (NOTE:
Trichinoisis is destroyed when the internal temperature reaches 139F
for a period of 10 minutes.) Remove from oven. Cover loosely with
foil and allow to "rest" for at least 15 minutes before carving.
