Title: SALATET HUMMUS
Categories: Salads, Middle east, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Chickpeas, dried
1/4 c  Parsley, finely chopped
1/4 c  Onion, finely chopped
1/2 ts Garlic, finely chopped
3 tb Lemon juice, fresh
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
pn Cayenne pepper
Starting a day ahead, wash the chick-peas in a sieve under cold
running water, then place them in a large bowl or pan and add enough
cold water to cover them by 2 inches. Soak at room temperature for at
least 12 hours. Drain the peas and place them in a small, heavy
saucepan. Add enough fresh water to cover them completely and bring
to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer partially
covered for about 1 1/2 hours, replenishing the liquid with boiling
water from time to time if necessary to keep the peas covered
throughout the cooking period. When done, the peas should be tender
to the bite but still somewhat firm. Drain and cool to room
temperature. Just before serving, combine the parsley, onions,
garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and cayenne pepper in a salad
bowl, and beat them together with a fork.  Add the chick-peas and
toss gently to coat the peas evenly with the dressing. Taste for
seasoning.
