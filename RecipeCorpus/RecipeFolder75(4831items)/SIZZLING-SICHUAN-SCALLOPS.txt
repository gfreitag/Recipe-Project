PAT DRY THE SCALLOPS. In a bowl, toss scallops with the marinade; set
aside for 30 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the chicken stock, soy
sauce, rice wine, sugar and cornstarch; set aside. Preheat the wok
over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and half the
salt. Add dry scallops to the hot oil, stir-fry for about 1 minute.
When the scallops begin to feel firm to the touch, remove from the
wok; set aside. Reheat the wok. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the ginger,
garlic, remaining salt, green onions, and chili paste; cook gently
for 15 seconds. Turn heat to high; toss in cucumbers. Stir-fry for 30
seconds. Add the sauce mixture and stir quickly to thicken. Return
the scallops to the wok, add the vinegar and sesame oil; quickly toss
for a few seconds to reheat. Place the cast iron platter on a burner
over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes or place in a very hot oven.
Sprinkle a few drops of water to test the heat. It should bubble and
sizzle. Put a heatproof trivet on the dining table. Carefully place
the hot sizzling platter on top of the trivet. As soon as the
scallops are finished, transfer the scallops to a plate and quickly
pour the mixture onto the hot platter and listen to it sizzle. Serve
hot. Makes 4 servings as the main entree or up to 8 as part of a
multicourse Chinese menu.
