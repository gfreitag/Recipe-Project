Title: SOUP WITHOUT TEARS
Categories: Thai, Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
One portion of
RED CURRY SAUCE,
See recipe
2 c  Fish stock
1 c  Shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 c  Mushrooms
2 tb Nam prik pao
(chilis paste in oil)
Heat the sauce, add the stock and nam prik pao, and stir to combine,
add the shrimp and mushrooms, and cook until the shrimp are pink.

Taste and adjust the flavor by adding fish sauce (salt), sugar, and
possibly more nam prik pao.

You can of course ring the changes, using different main ingredients,
different chili pastes and so on, but these three dishes, with a bowl
of rice will feed a small group (4-6 people) with plenty of variety.
