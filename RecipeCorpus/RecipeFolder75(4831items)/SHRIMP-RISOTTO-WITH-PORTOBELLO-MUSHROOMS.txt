Categories: Broccoli, Main dishes, Mushrooms, Rice, Seafood
1 TB dry sherry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 c  chopped portobello
mushrooms
:
4    to 4 1/2 cup  lowfat chicken
stock -- recipe in file
:
1 c  water
1 ts Old Bay Seasoniong
3/4 lb large "Easy-Peel" shrimp --
about 20-22
:
1 TB olive oil
1/2 c  finely chopped onion
1    clove garlic -- minced
1 1/4 c  Arborio rice
1 ts fresh thyme -- finely
chopped
:
4 c  broccoli florets

Pour the sherry over the chopped mushrooms, stir and set aside to
marinate while you prepare the risotto. In a large saucepan, bring 1
cup of the chicken stock, the water, and the Old Bay Seasoning to a
boil. Add the shrimp and poach for 3-5 minutes or until just pink.
Remove and shell. Set aside. Heat 2 teaspoons of the olive oil in a
heavy-bottomed skillet. Add the onion and saute over Medium heat for
2-5 minutes or until itis limp. Add the garlic and rice. Cook and
stir for 1 minute or until the rice just begins to change color.
Continuing to stir over Medium-Low heat, add the remaining chicken
stock 2/3 cup at a time, stirring until the liquid is absorbed.
Continue the process until the rice is tender and the mixture is
creamy (This can take up to 30 minutes.) Heat the other teaspoon of
olive oil in a small saute pan and briefly saute the marinated
mushroom pieces over Medium-High heat until they release their
liquid. Remove from the heat. Steam the broccoli for 5-6 minutes or
until it is bright green and tender. Stir the cooked shrimp, fresh
thyme and mushrooms into the cooked risotto and stir over Medium-Low
heat until heated through. Place the broccoli around the edge of a
large platter. Fill the center with the risotto. Serves 4-6
