streams to egg yolk while beating. Chill to cool. Cream butter. Beat
in cooled egg yolk mixture.  Seet aside in a cool place. Preheat oven
to 325. Line 3 12x18 inch cookie sheets with waxed paper. Liberally
grease and flour. Beat egg whites until soft peaks form when beater
is slowly raised. Gradually beat in sugar, 3 tbs. at a time, beating
well after each addition. At high speed, beat until stiff peaks form
when beater is slowly raised. Fold in 1 cup of finely chopped cashews
(save 1/2 cup for garnish) and vanilla, using rubber spatula, until
blended. Spread evenly onto baking sheets, 1/4 inch thick. Bake at
325 for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately cut wafer on
each baking sheet in 1/2 down the center, loosen and transefer to a
clean flat surface lined with wax paper, and quickly peel off the wax
paper that the wafer cooked on (if you don't do this now while the
wafer is hot, the paper won't come off). Spread icing thinly on top
of each wafer (you should have six 12 by 9 inch wafers) and layer.
Ice top layer and sprinkle with remaining nuts. Freeze. Cover cake
when icing has hardened. Serves 12. SANS RIVAL (Cake without a Rival)
