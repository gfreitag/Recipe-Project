Many cookbooks suggest stirring the starter once a day even when
being refrigerated; I find that it is not necessary. You must,
however, use a portion of the starter at least once a week. If you
choose not to bake sourdough breads that often, then remove a cup of
your starter and feed it as though you used some during the week. If
this is not done, your starter will turn rancid and have to be
replaced. Should you be away on vacation or otherwise not able to
tend to the starter, freeze it. Upon your return, thaw it in the
refrigerator and then remove a portion and feed it as soon as you are
able.
You may be thinking that this sounds too complicated, but it really
is not, nor is the starter overly fragile. A friend of mine had the
same starter for 14 years!
My first few loaves of sourdough were not very sour and I feared it
was my starter. After allowing the starter to mellow a little by
sitting in the refrigerator and using only once a week, it and the
breads became more sour.
Another hint is to put the bread in on the timer cycle for early
morning baking. The milk put in the night before adds a little more
sour taste. If the bread is getting too sour for you, feed with water
more often than milk. Source: The Bread Machine Cookbook by Donna
