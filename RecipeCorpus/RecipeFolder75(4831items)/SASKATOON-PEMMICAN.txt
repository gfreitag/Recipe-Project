1 c  Dried Saskatoon berries or
-dried blueberries
1 c  Unroasted sunflower seeds or

This version uses peanut butter rather than melted suet or lard as the
binding agent, which is more palatable for today's health conscious
diets.

Grind [or pound] the dried meat to a mealy powder. Add the dried
berries and seeds or nuts. Heat the honey, peanut butter and cayenne
until softened. Blend. When cooled, store in a plastic bag or sausage
casing in a cool dry place. It will keep for months.
