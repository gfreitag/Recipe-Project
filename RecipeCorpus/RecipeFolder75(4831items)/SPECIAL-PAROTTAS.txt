Title: SPECIAL PAROTTAS
Categories: Bread
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  + 2 tbflour
1 c  Water
2 tb Ghee
1 tb Oil
Salt
More oil as needed
Knead the (2 cups) flour, adding enough water and salt, to a smooth
dough. Smear 1/2 teaspoon of oil and keep aside for 30 minutes. Knead
the dough again and make 8 small balls. Mix 2 tablespoons of the
remaining flour with ghee and 1 tablespoon oil. Roll out each ball
thinly and smear the mixture of oil and ghee over two-thirds of each
round. Fold the ungreased portion of each round over the greased and
again over the remaining greased portion. (huh?) Set it aside for a
few minutes and them repeat the process. Repeat the process for the
third time, but do not spread any more oil. Keep it covered with a
cloth for half an hour or more. Roll it out lightly (without
pressing) into thick squares (good luck!) Heat the griddle. Heat the
parotta, adding a teaspoon of oil around the sides and turning
frequently till both sides are golden and crisp. Press it side to
side so that the layers get loose. Serve hot. -----! Note: Serve with
any hot curry...
