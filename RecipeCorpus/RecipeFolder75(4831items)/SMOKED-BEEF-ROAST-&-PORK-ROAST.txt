Title: SMOKED BEEF ROAST & PORK ROAST
Categories: Beef, Pork, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 Servings
20 lb Beef roast
20    Garlic cloves - whole
Pickled
10    Green onions - whole
WATER PAN SEASONINGS:
1 c  Wine - dry, red or white
2    Garlic cloves - whole
1 ts Mint - dried
6 dr Peychaud's bitters
Water
15 lb Pork roast
20    Cayenne peppers - fresh or
1    Onion - whole
1 tb Liquid smoke
2 tb Parsley
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
Stick a knife into each roast in several places, making a deep
puncture. With fingers, push 1 clove garlic in each hole, then a long
pepper and a green onion. Slice the pepper and onion off even with
the surface of the meat.  Sprinkle the roasts with salt and red
pepper. When you get your fire going and are ready to put the meat on
the smoker cooker, place some pre-soaked smoking wood (such as pecan
or hickory) on the briquets. Place seasonings in water pan, then add
water all the way to the top of the pan. Place beef roast, then pork
roast, in cooker and let them cook. I usually put these on about 11
P.M. and let them cook while I sleep. One 10-lb bag of charcoal will
usually do.

GRAVY 1/2 cup flour (for roux) 1/4 cup oil (for roux) cold water
juice from smoker cooker

After making a small roux, add enough cold water to blend roux. Then
add as much juice from smoker cooker pan as you wish. It has all the
juice and the tasty fat from the meat that was cooked. Simmer,
stirring frequently, until gravy thickens slightly.  Serve over rice.
