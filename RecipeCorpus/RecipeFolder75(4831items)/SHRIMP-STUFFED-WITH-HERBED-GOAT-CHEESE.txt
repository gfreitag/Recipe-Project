Categories: Appetizers, Jaw, Seafood
Yield: 2 Big eaters
1 lb Large shrimp, butterflied
4 oz Goat cheese
4 oz Cream cheese
1 md Clove garlic, minced
1 tb Whipping cream
4 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Olive oil
4 md Tomatoes, peeled, seeded,
And chopped
1 tb Chopped jalapeno chile
1    Lime (just the juice)
Bake shrimp in preheated 350-degree oven until barely firm, about 2
minutes. Remove and cool slightly. Mix goat cheese, cream cheese,
garlic, cream and 1/2 of cilantro together and season with salt and
pepper. Pipe cheese mixture onto butterflied part of each shrimp with
a pastry bag or spread on thickly with a knife. Increase oven
temperature to 400 degrees and bake stuffed shrimp about 3 minutes or
until opaque. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet and cook
tomatoes covered until their juice is exuded, about 5 minutes. Add
remaining cilantro, jalapeno, salt, pepper and lime juice to taste.
Cook uncovered until moisture has almost evaporated, leaving just
enough for a runny texture. Spoon tomato coulis onto warm plates and
serve stuffed shrimp on top.
