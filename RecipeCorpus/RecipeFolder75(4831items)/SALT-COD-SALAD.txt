To prepare the salt cod, place it in a bowl and add cold water to
cover and the apple or potato, which helps to draw out the salt.
Refrigerate overnight, changing the water several times during the
soaking. Drain the salt cod and rinse in fresh cool water. Place the
cod in a pan with cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce
the heat and cook gently until the fish is tender but not falling
apart, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste it before draining to make sure it is
cooked. If it is still too hard, continue cooking it gently. If you
find it still too salty at this point, cover with fresh cold water,
bring to a boil again, and drain and rinse. When the fish is tender,
drain and rinse under cold water. Drain well and pat dry with a
cotton kitchen towel. Check for any skin and bones that may have been
missed.

Break up the fish into large flakes and transfer to a serving plate.
In a small bowl stir together the oil, lemon juice, garlic and pepper
to taste. Drizzle over the fish. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve at
room temperature.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
