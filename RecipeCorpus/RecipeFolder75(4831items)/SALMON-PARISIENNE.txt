Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Break the fish into
flakes and set aside.

Put the salmon juice into a dish along with the scallops and wine.
Cover with cling film and puncture twice. Cook on MEDIUM POWER for 3
minutes. Chop the scallops and mix them into the flaked salmon. Melt
the butter in a dish on HIGH POWER for 30 seconds. Stir in the flour,
cook for a further 30 seconds on HIGH POWER. Add the liquor from the
scallops to the flour, mixing well to prevent lumps forming.

Cook on HIGH POWER for 1 minute. Stir the sauce into the salmon and
scallop mixture along with the parsley, tomatoes and fromage frais or
cream. Season to taste then pile equal amounts of the mixture into
shell shaped dishes.

Mix together the breadcrumbs and cheese. Sprinkle these over the
scallops. Arrange the dishes on a microwave proof tray. Cook on
MEDIUM POWER for 10 minutes. Brown under a conventional grill, if
liked. Serve with salad.
