Title: SOUR CREAM-ONION TWISTS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 90 Servings
2 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/3 c  Very finely minced onion
2 ts Dried chives, OR
2 tb Fresh, finely chopped
Chives
1/3 c  Sour cream
"These hearty crackers reflect the clean, clear flavors of sour cream
and onions. They are impressive, reliable standbys for entertaining
of all types. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and pepper in the food
processor or a large bowl. Add the onion and mix well.

In a separate bowl, thoroughly blend the sour cream and egg together.
Add the sour cream mixture to the flour mixture and blend well to
form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If necessary
to achieve the proper consistency for rolling, add 1 additional
Tablespoon sour cream.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/16 inch thick. To make the
twists, cut the dough into strips 3/4 inch by 6 inches. Twist the
ends of each strip in opposite directions and press the ends down on
the baking sheet to keep them from unwinding.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the twists are lightly browned.
The ends will be slightly thinner from the pressing and will brown
first. Cool on a rack. Yield: 85-90.

VARIATIONS: If preferred, these crackers can be baked flat in 2-inch
squares or circles. Be sure to remember to prick each one 2 or 3
times with the tines of a fork. Brush the tops with a lightly beaten
egg, if desired.
