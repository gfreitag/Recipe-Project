Title: SHERI PORTWOOD'S SOUR CREAM DOUGH
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Allpurpose bleached flour
1/2 ts Salt
16 tb Cold unsalted butter -- (2
Sticks)
2/3 c  Sour cream
Combine flour and salt in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse
several times to mix. Cut butter into 15 to 20 pieces and add to work
bowl. Pulse repeatedly, about 20 times in all, to reduce the mixture
to a fine powder. Open the cover and check the consistency
occasionally to avoid overprocessing and turning the mixture into a
paste. Add sour cream to work bowl and pulse 5 or 6 times more, or
until the dough forms a coherent ball. Don't overprocess. Remove
dough from work bowl to a floured surface and press it into two 6inch
disks. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate. Keep the dough in the
refrigerator for up to two days, or doublewrap in plastic and freeze
for up to several weeks. Yield: About 22 ounces of dough, enough for
a 2crust pie
