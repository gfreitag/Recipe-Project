1. Over medium heat, heat a wide, heavy-bottomed lidded pan until
hot. Melt butter, and brown meat in two batches. Add onions; cook
until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle flour over meat
and cook until well browned, about 5 to 8 minutes, stirring often.

2. Add wine and bring to a boil, scraping bottom of pan to loosen
brown bits. Add stock and bouquet garni, bring to a boil, cover, and
cook on low heat for 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is tender. Remove lid
after 1 hour; add carrots and cook, uncovered, for the last 30
minutes.

3. Meanwhile, peel rutabagas and potatoes and cut into large chunks.
Place in separate saucepans and cover amply with cold salted water.
Bring each to a boil and simmer until tender, about 30 to 40 minutes
for rutabagas and z5 minutes for potatoes. Drain; return to hot
saucepans to dry for a few minutes.

4. Put rutabagas and potatoes through a food mill or ricer, or mash by
hand. Add butter to taste, and enough hot milk to make a creamy puree.
Season to taste with Salt and pepper; stir in chopped rosemary.

5. Heat oven to 350'. Remove bouquet garni, and turn stew into a deep
2-quart baking dish. Top with puree; dot lightly with butter. Bake
for 1 hour, or until the top is brown and crusty.
