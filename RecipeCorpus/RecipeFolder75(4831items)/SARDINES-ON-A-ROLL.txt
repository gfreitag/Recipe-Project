Title: SARDINES ON A ROLL
Categories: Sandwiches, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
2 cn (4 oz each) Maine Sardines
1 c  Ketchup
2 tb Onion; chopped fine
1 1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Garlic powder
6    Hamburger rolls
2 tb Butter; softened
1 1/2 c  Cheese; shredded
Drain sardines and cut into large pieces.  Combine ketchup, onion,
oregano, and garlic powder.  Mix thoroughly. Cut rolls in half and
spread with butter. Place rolls on a cookie sheet and toast them
lightly in the oven. Place sardines on rolls and cover with ketchup
mixture. Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake in a moderate oven, 350 F for 10
to 15 minutes, or until cheese melts.

Dave's notes:  Dump the ketchup, oregano, and garlic powder and open
up a jar of Ragu Pizza Quick Sauce, adding the onions. It tastes a
lot better than the "dumbed down" tomato sauce Uncle Sam came up with
using ketchup.
