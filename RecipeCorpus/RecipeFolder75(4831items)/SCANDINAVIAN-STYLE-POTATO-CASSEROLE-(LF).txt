Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Drain the anchovies, rinse them in a strainer, and chop them. Add the
anchovies, onions, and caraway seeds to the butter and cook just
until the onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Combine the potatoes and
the onion mixture, tossing to mix. Pour the mixture into a large
shallow baking dish. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the top.  In a
bowl, blend together the milk and ricotta cheese with a wire whisk.
Pour this mixture over the potatoes; it will still be a little lumpy,
but that's okay. Dot with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of butter.
Bake at 400F for 1 hour, or until top is nicely browned.
