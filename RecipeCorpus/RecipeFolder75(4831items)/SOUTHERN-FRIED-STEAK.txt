ROXIE, MY MOM USED TO MAKE THIS FOR ME ALL THE TIME. IT IS QUITE
SIMPLE. BUY SOME CUBE STEAK AND COOK LIKE THIS. PAT THE CUBE STEAK
DRY WITH PAPER TOWELS AND THEN TOSS IN THIS MIXTURE. FRY IT IN A PAN
WITH A LITTLE VEG. OIL ON MEDIUM HEAT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAUTEE' SOME
ONIONS IN WHAT IS LEFT IN THE PAN. AFTER THIS MIX TOGETHER ABOUT TWO
TABLESPOONS OF FLOUR AND HOT WATER. BE SURE THEY ARE WELL MIXED. POUR
THIS INTO THE FRYING PAN. (BEING CAREFUL) BRING THIS TO A LIGHT BOIL
STIRRING CONSTANTLY AND THAT IS YOUR GRAVY. YOU CAN ADD OR DELETE
HERBS AND SPICES TO AND FROM THE FLOUR MIXTURE AS TO YOUR TASTES.
