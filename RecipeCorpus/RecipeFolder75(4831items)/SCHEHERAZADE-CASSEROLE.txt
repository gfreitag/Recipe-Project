Categories: Vegetarian, Casseroles
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Raw bulgur
1 c  Boiling water
1 tb Olive oil
2 c  Minced onion
3    Large cloves garlic, minced
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Cumin
1 1/2 ts Basil
Black pepper & cayenne
1    Large green pepper, diced
3/4 c  Dry soybeans, soaked 4 hours
1    14 oz. can tomatoes, drained
3 tb Tomato paste-half 7 oz. can
1/2 c  Finely minced parsley
1 1/2 c  Feta cheese, crumbled
Preheat oven to 375 F.  Lightly oil a 9x13 inch baking pan. Place the
bulgur in a small bowl.  Add boiling water, cover with a plate, and
let stand at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a
large skillet.  Add onion, garlic, salt and seasonings. Stir
occasionally as you saute over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes. Add
green pepper and saute about 5 minutes more. Drain the soybeans, if
necessary, and place them in a blender or food processor with 1 cup
fresh water. Grind until the soybeans resemble a coarse batter.
Transfer to a large bowl. Add the soaked bulgur and sauteed
vegetables to the soybeans. Stir in the tomatoes, breaking them up
into bite-sized pieces. Add tomato paste, parsley and 1 cup of the
feta. Mix well. Spread into the baking pan and sprinkle the remaining
feta on top.  Cover and bake for 30 minutes at 375 F., then uncover
and bake 15 minutes more with the oven turned down to 350 F. Serve
hot.
