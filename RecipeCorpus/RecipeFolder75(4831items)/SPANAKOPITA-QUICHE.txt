-cup)
1/4 ts Pepper
2/3 c  Nonfat buttermilk
2    Eggs

Coat a 9-inch pieplate with cooking spray; set aside. Press spinach
between paper towels until barely moist; set aside.

Position knife blade in food processor bowl; add cottage cheese and
next 5 ingredients, and process until smooth. Add spinach, green
onions, oregano, and garlic; process 45 seconds. Set aside.

Working with 1 phyllo sheet at a time, lightly coat each sheet with
cooking spray. Fold phyllo sheet in half crosswise to form a 13- x
8-1/2-inch rectangle, and lightly coat both sides of rectangle with
cooking spray. Gently press rectangle into pieplate, allowing ends to
extend over edges of pieplate.

Repeat procedure with a second sheet of phyllo, placing it across
first sheet in a crisscross design; sprinkle 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs
over second sheet. Repeat procedure with remaining phyllo and
breadcrumbs, continuing in crisscross design, ending with phyllo.
Fold in edges of phyllo to fit pieplate and form a rim.

Pour spinach mixture into prepared crust; gently arrange tomato
slices over filling.

Bake at 350 deg for 55 minutes or until a knife inserted 1 inch from
center comes out clean; let stand 10 minutes. Yield: 6 servings
(serving size: 1 wedge).

Serving Ideas : Cut into wedges.

NOTES : Spinach, feta cheese, and phyllo dough, key ingredients in the
classic Greek dish spanakopita (span-uh-KOH-pih-tuh), combine with
cottage cheese in this unique quiche. Breadcrumbs sprinkled between
the phyllo layers prevent a soggy crust.
