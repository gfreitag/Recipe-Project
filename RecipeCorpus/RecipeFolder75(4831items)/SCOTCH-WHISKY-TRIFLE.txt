whisking occasionally. Mix in vanilla.

until powder dissolves.  Beat to firm peaks. Add Scotch and beat
until firm. Fold cream mixture into cold custard in 2 additions. (Can
be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For trifle: Place half of pound cake cubes in 3-quart trifle bowl or
glass bowl.  Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons Scotch and toss. Heat jam in

cake and spread. Top with half of custard.  Top with 1/2 the
raspberries, making sure some berries show at sides of bowl. Top with
half of bananas. Place remaining pound cake cubes in another bowl.
Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons Scotch and toss.  Layer fruit over. Spoon
remaining jam over and spread. Top with remaining custard, then with
other halves of raspberries and bananas. Cover and refrigerate until
