Also, just wanted to note, I started this program just before
travelling home from Christmas at my parents' house. I stopped at a
restaurant with a salad bar, got veggie soup, salade and a plain
baked potato on the side. They had fruit on the salad bar too, so I
could have had that for dessert, but I didn't have any room left in
the tum.
