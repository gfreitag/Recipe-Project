Soft-shell crabs are in season from late spring through August. You
should buy them alive and use the same day. (WP)

1. Prepare the crab: Remove the lungs and tail and arrange the crab
on a large platter.  Sprinkle with the minced jalapeno and the
chopped cilantro. Pour the lime juice over and let marinate for at
least 30 minutes, refrigerated.  When ready to cook, season lighlty
with salt.

2. Prepare the batter: In a small bowl, sift together the flour and
baking powder.  Whisk in the water until the batter is smooth, then
add the remaining ingredients, seasoning with cayenne and salt to
taste. If made earlier in the day, set the bowl into an ice bath.

3. At serving time, in a deep, heavy saucepan, wok, or deep-fat
fryer, heat 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees.

4. Dip each crab into the batter and coat well. Carefully place one
or two in the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
Remove with a slotted spoon or a flat strainer and drain on paper or
clean toweling. Keep warm while preparing the remaining crab and the
spinach.

5. Use the same oil to fry the spinach. Clean the spinach leaves
well, trim and dry thoroughly.  Fry until crisp and translucent,
about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on clean
toweling. Season with salt to taste and serve immediately.

Presentation: Arrange a few fried spinach leaves on half of each of 4
plates.  Place 1 crab on the other half and serve immediately.

To prepare ahead: Through step 2, the fish can be marinating, the
batter ready. Have the spinach cleaned and ready. Heat the oil at
serving time and continue with the recipe.

Note: Shrimp can be substituted for the crab.  If using shrimp, peel,
leaving the tail intact.
