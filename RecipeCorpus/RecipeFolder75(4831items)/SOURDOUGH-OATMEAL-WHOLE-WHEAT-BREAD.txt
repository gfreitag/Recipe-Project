1 c  Sourdough starter
1 tb Sea salt
2 pk Dry yeast
5 c  Whole wheat flour; to 6 c.
1/2 c  -warm water (110F)
2    Eggs, beaten
1 1/4 c  -boiling water
6 tb Rolled oats
1 c  Rolled oats
1    Egg white; beaten
2/3 c  Light molasses; (or honey)
1 tb -water
1/3 c  Safflower oil
Measure out sourdough starter. Soften yeast in warm water. Combine
boiling water, oats, molasses, oil and salt. Cool to lukewarm. Stir
in 2 c. flour. Beat well. Add to sourdough starter along with
softened yeast and eggs. Stir in enough of remaining flour to make a
soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 5 - 8
minutes or until smooth and elastic. Shape dough into a ball and
place in lightly greased bowl, turning once. Cover with a cloth and
set in a warm place free from drafts and let rise 1 to 2 hours or
until doubled in size. Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly
floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10
minutes. Coat 2 well greased loaf pans with about 3 tbsp oats per
pan. Shape dough into loaves and place in pans. Cover and let rise in
warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in size. Brush loaves
with mixture of egg white and water. Sprinkle tops lightly with
rolled oats. Bake at 375F for 40 to 50 minutes or until done(I find
mine are always done at 35 minutes so watch carefully). Makes 2
loaves.
