Categories: Vegetables, Bar-b-q
Yield: 2 Cups
2 md Eggplants
3    Garlic cloves, chop coarsely
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Tahini, *
4 tb Lemon juice, fresh
1 ts Pepper
Wash eggplants and, with fork, prick them in about 5 spots. Grill
whole eggplants over medium-hot coals. Turn about every 5 minutes to
evenly char skin.  Grill until just soft and charred all over, about
20 minutes. Cool. Cut in half and scoop out insides (you may find it
easier to peel skin off with your fingers if eggplant gets too mushy).
In food processor fitted with metal blade, combine eggplant,
garlic,salt, sugar, tahini, lemon juice and pepper. Puree until
smooth. If mixture seems too thick, add a little water to achieve
desired consistency. Adjust seasoning.
*This paste, made from sesame seeds, is available at most grocery
stores. Makes 2 cups depending on size of eggplants.
