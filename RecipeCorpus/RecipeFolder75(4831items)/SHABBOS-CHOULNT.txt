NOTES:

*  European Jewish traditional sabbath stew -- This is a food that
religious Jewish people eat on Saturday afternoon. Religious people
do not cook on Saturday, so this food must be put on the stove on
Friday, before sunset. It then cooks overnight, filling the house
with a delicious aroma, until after services Saturday afternoon.
Shabbos means "Saturday" in Hebrew, and choulnt means "a mishmosh" in
Yiddish. (choulnt in fact comes originally from the French chaud lent
which means "warm slowly") The amount of each ingredient depends on
what taste one likes, how much is available, and the tradition handed
down by one's parents or Rebbitzin (Rabbi's wife). Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  Variations:  Some communities add some eggs (in the shell), and
lots of curry.  (in which case it is called Chamin, which means "warm
food.")

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
