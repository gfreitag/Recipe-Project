Last night I made Shanghai Dumplings and thought of you when I opened
the package of wrappers.  It had a real simple recipe that sounded
good. Slice a banana into about fifteen pieces, wrap each piece in a
won-ton or potsticker skin, deep fry it until golden, cool and then
dust with powdered sugar.
