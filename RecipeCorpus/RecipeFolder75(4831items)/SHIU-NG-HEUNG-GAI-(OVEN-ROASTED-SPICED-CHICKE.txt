Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 kg (3 lb) chicken pieces
1/3 c  Light soy sauce

The following two recipes come from Charmaine Solomon's THE COMPLETE
ASIAN COOKBOOK.  I haven't tried either yet but plan to once we
finish remodeling our kitchen.

This method of preparation is particularly suited for chicken
drumsticks, thighs or wings.  If it is not possible to buy selected
joints, a whole chicken can be used. See variation at end of recipe.

Oven temperature: 350 to 375 degrees Cooking Time: 45 minutes to 1
hour

Wash chicken pieces, dry well on paper towels.  In a large shallow
dish mix soy sauce, oil and wine.  Crush garlic to a pulp with salt
and add to soy mixture with ginger and five spice. Mix well. Put
chicken joints in marinade and turn to coat all sides.  Cover and
marinate for 1 hour or more.

Remove chicken from the marinade, put in a roasting pan in one layer
and spoon about 2 Tb of the marinade over. Roast in a moderate oven
for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until chicken is brown and crisp, basting
every 20 minutes with the marinade.  Serve hot or cold.

Wings need about 45 minutes roasting time, drumsticks from 45-55
minutes and thighs 1 hour.  Thighs should be roasted skin side
uppermost.

Variation:

Make a marinade as above and rub it well all over a 3 1/2 lb roasting
chicken.  Spoon some of the marinade into the cavity of the chicken as
well.  Marinate for 1 hour, then roast as above, turning the chicken
first on one side and then on the other so it is browned all over.
Baste frequently. Finish cooking chicken breast upwards. It should
take about 1 hour 45 minutes.  To serve, carve chicken as for
red-cooked chicken.
