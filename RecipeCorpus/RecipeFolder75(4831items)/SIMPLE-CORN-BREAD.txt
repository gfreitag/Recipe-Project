Title: SIMPLE CORN BREAD
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Whole wheat flour (ww pastry
Flour will work)
4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Honey
2 c  Frozen corn (canned would
Probably work)
In a blender, combine water, honey, and 1 cup of the corn. Blend until
liquified. In a bowl, combine dry ingredients, and mix together. Pour
in blended liquid, and mix. Mix in last cup of corn.

Spritz a 9" round glass pan with oil spray, and sprinkle with
cornmeal. Pour batter into pan, and put in oven. Turn oven on to 350
deg. F, and bake for 30 minutes. (If you pre-heat oven, you may need
to shorten the time). You can test for doneness. This can be ready
from cupboard to mouth in 42 or so minutes.

The original source was David Wallis, but there have been some
updates.

NOTE: As far as the spray adding to the %CFF, I think that most of it
is absorbed by the cornmeal dusted over the spray. When I pop the
bread out of the pan, there is a 'film' left. It sure makes getting
bread out quick, easy, and hot!
