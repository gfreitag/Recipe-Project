Title: SOUR RYE WITH CARRAWAY SEEDS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1 pn Of sugar
1 c  Tepid water
2 c  Starter
3 tb Carraway seeds
1 c  Rye flour
1 c  Gluten (can be purchased in
-GNC stores or other
health food places. It makes a difference in texture). Or see "joy of
Cooking" to make your own gluten.

Mix yeast, 1/4 cup tepid water and pinch sugar. Let dissolve and get
frothy. Then add all ingredients together, knead dough till smooth.
Let rise till doubled. Shape into two round loaves and let rise
again. Set a pan of boiling water 2" deep on the lower shelf. Bake at
425~ for 15 minutes, then lower temp to 350~ for another 30 minutes.
This can also be made in a breadmaker. Comes out fine. If you have a
smaller machine, halve the recipe. I just put all the stuff in the
machine, R2D2, hit the button, and let it go. Delicious. Freezes well
also. Hey guys, try getting a machine if you don't have one. Makes
breadmaking easy and quick. I could have done the job in the time it
took to type this.

If someone can't eat food with seeds in it, just toss the carroway
seeds into a blender or chopper and beat them to a powder and add to
mixture

Replace used starter with flour and water used, stir well, let sit
out a few hours and refrigerate. On and on.
