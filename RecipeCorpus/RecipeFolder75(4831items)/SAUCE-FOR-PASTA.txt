Title: SAUCE FOR PASTA
Categories: None

1 ds Olive olive
1    White wine
1    "chicken" broth

1    Vegetables of choice
1    Mushrooms of choice

Like i said before, I eat alot of home made pasta and do not use a
tomatoe baste sauce.  I use a smig of olive oil, white wine and
chicken broth, thicken slightly with cornstarch. To this I ad stir
fry veggies such as mushrooms, pea pods, broccli, carrots- and
chicken or shrimp. Oh, don't forget the garlic!
