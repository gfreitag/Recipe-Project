4    Blue crabs
3 ts Tamarind pulp
3/4 c  Boiling water
2    Chopped onions

This Singapore dish is a classic and, like all classics, it is superb.
Serve it with plain rice.

Boil a large pot of water and drop in 4 green blue swimmers. Boil them
rapidly for 4 minutes then tip the contents of the pot into a
colander to drain. When cool enough to handle, chop crabs into
quarters with a cleaver or large knife, leaving legs at- tached to
body. With a hammer. gently crack the claws and areas of harder shell.

Put 3 teaspoons tamarind pulp to soak in 3/4 cup boiling water.
Finely chop 2 onions, grate 5 cm piece fresh ginger, finely slice 2-3
birdseye chillies (or to taste) and chop 3 green (spring) onions. Mix
2 teaspoons cornflour with a little water.

In a large wok or pan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil and stir- fry onion,
ginger and 2/3 of the chopped chillies for a couple of minutes. Add
crab pieces and strained tamarind water, lower heat and simmer for
3-4 minutes. Lift the crab out onto a serving dish and to the mixture
in the wok add 3 teaspoons sugar and 2 of tomato paste. Stir, add
dissolved cornflour and stir again until the mixture thickens. Pour
over the crab, garnish with the rest of the chillies and the spring
onions and serve.
