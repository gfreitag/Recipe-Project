You guys over on the right coast should be able to find all this at
hand. Chef Phil Sheremeta of The Pasta Shop, (Oakland, Ca.),
developed this recipe. Buy or make your own saffron ravioli dough to
stuff with this delectable combination of Spanish flavors.

Clean shrimp and reserve shells.  Poach shrimp in well salted water
with pickling spice.  Discard liquid. Poach halibut in wine until
set. Do not overcook. Steam clams in white wine and garlic. Remove
from shells and reserve liquid.  Leave smaller clams whole and
coarsely chop larger ones. Gently toss seafood together and dress
with olive oil. Set aside.

SAUCE:

SPECIAL REQUIREMENT:  cheesecloth, parchment paper, rice flour.

Steep threads in white wine for 30 minutes.  Cook shrimp shells in
hot oil just until they turn pink. Then combine them with thyme, bay
leaves and peppercorns in cheesecloth.  Saute onion until soft and
golden, not brown, in oil used for shrimp shells. Add garlic and
saute for an additional 5 minutes. Deglaze pan with white wine,
poaching liquid and clam broth. Add tomatoes and cheesecloth sachet.
Simmer for 1 3/4 hours. Add orange juice and zest and simmer for an
additional 15 minutes.

TO ASSEMBLE:

Place about 1 tablespoon seafood mix on each large size ravioli pasta
sheet, cover with second layer. Moisten borders with water, press out
any air, and cut with fluted ravioli cutter. Lay on sheet pans lined
with parchment paper and sprinkle with rice flour to keep dry. Cover
with plastic.

TO COOK:

Use a wide pan with plenty of water.  Cook 3 or-4 raviolis at a time
for 3 to 4 minutes, removing them with a slotted spoon. Serve on a
bed of the Spanish sauce.
