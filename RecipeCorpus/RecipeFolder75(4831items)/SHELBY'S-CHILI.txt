Categories: Ground beef, Cheese/eggs, Beer, Chili
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1 lb Coarse grind beef round
1 lb Coarse grind beef chuck
8 oz Tomato sauce
12 oz Beer
1/4 c  Ground Red hot chili
2    Garlic cloves; finely chop

1 1/4 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Paprika
1 1/2 ts Ground Cumin
1 1/4 ts Salt

3/4 lb Monterey Jack cheese; grated
Melt the suet or heat the oil in a heavy 3-quart (or larger) pot over
medium-high heat. Remove the unrendered suet and add the meat to the
pot. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally,
until the meat is evenly browned. Add the tomato sauce, beer, ground
chile, garlic, onion, oregano, paprika, 1 teaspoon of the cumin, and
the salt. Stir to blend. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and
simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Stir occasionally. Taste and adjust
seasonings, ading the cayenne pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 1 hour
longer. Stir in the cheese and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of the
cumin. Simmer 1/2 hour longer, stirring often to keep the cheese from
burning.
