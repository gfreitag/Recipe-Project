stirring often, until soft.  Stir in broth, then add potato. Cover
and cook until potato is tender. Cool, then process in a food
processor or blender until pureed.  In another saucepan, bring cream
to a gentle simmer, cook until just slightly reduced, then stir in
leek mixture and heat until very hot (but don't boil).  Season with
salt, pepper and nutmeg. Serve hot. Sprinkle 1 Tbl. cheese over each
serving and offer a shot of the wine on the side. Hope you enjoy this
as much as we did. Slurp, slurp.
