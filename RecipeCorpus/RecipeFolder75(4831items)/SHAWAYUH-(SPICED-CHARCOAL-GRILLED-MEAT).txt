Title: SHAWAYUH (SPICED CHARCOAL GRILLED MEAT)
Categories: Meats, Yemani
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Thickly cut grilling steaks
-OR- lamb chops
3 ts Hawayij
Oil; for basting
Salt
Slit fat selvedge on steaks or chops to prevent meat curling while
cooking. Sprinkle meat on each side with hawayij and leave for 30
minutes at room temperature.

When coals are red hot, dab meat with oil and place over fire. Cook
until seared on each side and raise grid or move meat to a cooler
part of the fire. Continue to cook until done to taste, though the
Yemani taste is for well-done meat.  Brush occasionally with oil
during cooking.

When cooked, season with salt and serve immediately.
