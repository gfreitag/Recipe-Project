Title: SCOTCH EGGS
Categories: Eggs
Yield: 2 Servings
4 ea Hard cooked eggs
1/2 lb Sausage meat
1 ea Egg, slightly beaten
1 x  Fat or oil for frying
1 x  Seasoned flour
1 x  Bread crumbs
1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
Hard-boil the eggs by placing in a pan of cold water and heating
slowly until it starts to simmer.  Do not allow water to boil as this
will toughen the whites, but keep at this temperature for 30 minutes.
Place in cold water and shell when eggs are quite cold. Dip in
seasoned flour. Cover with sausage meat, then dip in beaten egg and
coat with bread crumbs, pressing crumbs well in. Fry in deep fat or
oil (375 deg. F.) until golden brown. Drain, and cut in halves. Serve
hot or cold.
