Title: SESAME SHRIMP TOAST
Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2 lb Peeled raw shrimp or prawns
2    Egg whites
3 c  Oil for deep-frying
3 sl Day-old bread
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cornstarch
1 c  White sesame seeds
These tasty dainties are quick and easy to prepare. They are a popu-
lar snack and banquet dish that takes several forms, depending on
budget and occasion.  The lesser tea houses stretch the shrimp by
adding 1/3 soft-flesh fish.

Preparation:  Peel and devein raw shrimp.  Chop, then mash, shrimp to
soft pulp.  A cleaver or food processor works well for this. Mix
shrimp meat with salt and cornstarch. Remove crust from bread; slice
each into 6 rectangles.  We used heavy wheat bread, which gives a
chewy texture; light white bread would be more crisp and absorb less
oil. Separate eggs; beat whites to stiff peaks.  Fold egg whites
completely into shrimp mixture.

Deep-frying:  Because shrimp mixture is a little runny, wait until
you are ready to deep-fry before spreading mixture on bread. Put
about 1 teaspoon of mixture on each piece of bread. Set them on
plate; sprin- kle with raw white sesame seeds.

Heat oil slowly to medium hot.  Test with crust of bread; it should
brown in 10 seconds.  Deep-fry 6 pieces at a time, shrimp side down,
until they brown; then roll them over to brown the bread. Pieces are
buoyant balls, which may be uncooperative, so keep an eye on them.
Frying time is about 3 minutes.  After frying, remove to warm serving
platter. Serve.

After deep-frying, they keep for about 30 minutes in warm oven.
However, they are best right out of deep-fryer. We suggest you fry a
second batch midway through the buffet; to fry 18 takes about 7
minutes.
