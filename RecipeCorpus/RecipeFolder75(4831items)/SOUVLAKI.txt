Souvlaki may also be made with pieces of beef or fish. You might want
to use marinated scallops, shripm or halibut.

Combine all ingredients; let meat marinate in refrigerator for three
to six hours, turning meat over several times. Put meat on oiled
skewers and set to grill over charcoal, turning to brown evenly. In
the oven, rest the skewers on rack of proiler pan and brown about six
inches below the heat. Turn occasionally to maintain even color and
baste with marinating sauce. Broil until meat is brown and crispy;
about 45 minutes.
