Title: SMOKEY SALMON BURGERS
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 10 Servings
418 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
450 g  Cold mashed potato
175 g  Raw potato; grated
1 ts Vegetable oil
50 g  Bacon, preferably smoked
- chopped
Oil for frying
10    Soft round rolls
MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
Salad and relishes
Drain the salmon and break fish into flakes. Set aside. Mix together
the mashed and grated potato in a bowl. Heat the vegetable oil in a
frying pan and fry the bacon until it is crisp. Add the bacon to the
potato mixture along with the salmon, mixing well to break up the
salmon.

Divide the mixture into 10 or 12 pieces and shape each piece into a
burger using hands or a burger maker. Fry the burgers gently for 5
minutes on each side, or until they are well browned. (It is best to
cook 3 or 4 burgers at one time or the pan will be too crowded to
turn them over easily.)

Keep the cooked burgers warm whilst preparing the rest, then serve in
split rolls garnished with salad and relishes.

Makes 10-12. Approx. 380 kcals per serving
