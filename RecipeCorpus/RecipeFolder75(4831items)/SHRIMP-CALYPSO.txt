1 lb Large shrimp -- shelled and

1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Dried oregano -- crumbled
1/4 ts Dried thyme -- crumbled
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Paprika
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper

To toast coconut: Preheat oven to 350. Spread coconut in a single
layer and bake 4-5 minutes until golden brown.

Place the shrimp in a medium sized bowl.  In a separate bowl, combine
the salt, oregano, thyme, cumin, paprika, cayenne and black pepper
and sprinkle the mixture over the shrimp.  Toss well, cover and
refrigerate until needed.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.  Add the shallots and
the shrimp and saute until the shrimp turn pink - about 2 minutes.

Add the wine and orange juice and cook until almost all the liquid is
absorbed.  Add the mango and cook until it is just heated through - 1
minute more.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cilantro. Adjust the
seasoning if necessary.

Transfer the shrimp to warmed dinner plates.  Sprinkle with toasted
coconut and serve immediately.
