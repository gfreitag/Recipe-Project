Categories: African, Beef, Main dishes, Soups & ste
Yield: 1 Servings
6 sm Canned tomatoes -- , with
Juice
1    Whole fresh hot chile
4 md Onions -- , whole
1/4 c  Green bell pepper
6 tb Vegetable oil
1 lb Stewing beef -- , cut in
Cubes
1 c  Water [or beef broth]
1/4 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Cayenne [more or less to
Taste]
1 1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
1 lb Fresh spinach
1.  Reserve 1/2 cup of juice from the canned tomatoes, and discard
the rest of the juice.  Combine the chile, tomatoes, onions, and
green bell pepper in a food processor, and process until the
vegetables are minced but not pureed. 2.  Heat the oil in a large,
cast-iron pot, and saute the vegetables and beef for 5 minutes over
high heat. 3. Add the reserved tomato juice, water sugar, salt,
cayenne, and ginger. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 hours.
Stir occasionally to keep from burning. 4. Meanwhile, soak the
spinach in warm water for 15 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly,
separate, rinse again (and even a third time if you want to be extra
careful), shred coarsely, and set aside. 5. After 2 hours, add the
spinach to the pot and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, until
the water is gone and the spinach is cooked. 6.  About half an hour
before serving, prepare boiled rice. Serve Shoko with rice. [Also
good served with Yam Foofoo.]
