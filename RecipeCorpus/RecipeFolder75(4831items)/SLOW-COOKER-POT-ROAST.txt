Title: SLOW COOKER POT ROAST
Categories: Beef, Crockpot
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Chuck Roast
1 1/2    Onions, chopped
2    Garlic cloves - minced
16 oz Can stewed tomatoes
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Oil
Coarsely ground pepper
Flour to cover the roast
Salt
8 oz Water (1/2 can)
I used the 4 qt westbend which has a removable cooking pot which can
be used to brown the roast on the stove top.... Saute onion & garlic
with oil in the cooking pot till transparent. Season the roast with
Salt & Pepper and then dredge (lightly) in flour. Brown roast (on top
of the onions & garlic) in the cook-pot on both sides (10 min).
Transfer to the slow cooker, add the stewed tomatoes, water and
Worcestershire sauce. Cooked on setting 4 (of 5) for about 5 hrs.
When done, puree the remaining tomatoes, juices & onions, return to
pan, add thickener for gravy...
