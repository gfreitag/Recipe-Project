Soak the rice noodles in a bowl of warm water for 25 minutes. Drain
in a colander or sieve.  (If you are using dried egg noodles, cook
them for 3 to 5 minutes in boiling water, drain, and immerse them in
cold water until required.) Wash and finely shred the white part of
the leeks. Finely shred the carrots, peppers, scallions and chili. In
a small bowl, combine the eggs with the sesame oil and salt. Heat a
wok or large pan over a high heat and add the oil.  When almost
smoking, add the carrots, leeks, scallions and salt and stir-fry for
a few seconds. Add the peppers and stir-fry for about 1 minute.  Put
in the curry sauce ingredients and the drained noodles.  Stir-fry the
mixture for about 5 minutes until well mixed and heated through. Then
add the egg mixture blending thoroughly. Stir-fry for 1 further
minute.  Serve at once, garnished with fresh coriander.
