3 tb Flour
3 c  Milk
1/2 c  Monterey Jack, shredded

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 ea Onions
3 tb Butter
1/3 c  Parsley, chopped

Melt butter in saucepan. Stir in flour, then cook, stirring
constantly, for 1 minute. Gradually stir in milk, then cook, stirring
constantly, until bubbly thick. Stir in Monterey Jack cheese and
cayenne pepper.

Preheat oven to 375. Grease a 9"x13" glass baking dish. Finely chop
onion. Saute onion in butter in skillet. Stir in parsley, cheese, and
just enough white sauce to moisten.  Stir in chopped crab legs and
cayenne pepper. Divide filling among tortillas, then roll up and
arrange seam side down in a dish.  Pour remaining white sauce over.
Cover with foil. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly hot.

Sylvia's comments: I doubt a Mexican would find anything authentic
about this, but it was sure good! For a potluck, I used 20 small
tortillas instead of 8 large ones. If the filling is still warm when
you put the finished tortillas into the oven, 10-20 minutes is plenty
of time to get it hot.
