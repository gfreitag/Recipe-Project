Categories: Appetizers, Mexican, Party foods, Shore house
Yield: 2 Servings
2 tb Butter
1 md Onion -- thinly sliced
1 tb Golden brown sugar
1/4 ts White wine vinegar
1 1/2 c  Smoked Gouda cheese --
Grated
4    10" flour tortilla
2 oz Sliced prosciutto --
Chopped
2 tb Butter -- melted
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add
onion, brown sugar, and vinegar; saute until onion is golden brown,
stirring frequently, about 25 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cool to
room temperature.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Sprinkle cheese over half of each
tortilla, dividing equally.  Sprinkle prociutto and sauted onion over
cheese. Season with pepper. Fold other half of tortilla over cheese
mixture. Brush tortillas with some of melted butter.

Brush heavy large skillet with some of the melted butter. Place over
med-high heat.  Working in batches, cook quesadillas just until brown
spots appear, brushing skillet with butter between batches, about 2
minutes per side.  Transfer quesadillas to hevy large baking sheet.

Bake until tortillas are golden and cheese melts about
5    minutes.

Transfer quesadillas to work surface.  Cut each into 6 triangles.
Arrange on platter and serve hot.

NOTE:  I sometimes speed up the process by placing prepared
quesadillas directly under the broiler for a quick minute or so on
each side.
