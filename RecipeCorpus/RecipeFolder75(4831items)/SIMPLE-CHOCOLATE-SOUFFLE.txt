Title: SIMPLE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
25 g  Cornflour
250 ml Milk
100 g  Good dark chocolate
50 g  Sugar
3    Egg yolks
5    Egg whites
1 tb Extra sugar, caster if
-available.
It is a very light souffle, which doesn't sink *too* much when you
dig into it. If any is left over it is still very fluffy and yummy
when cold.

Mix cornflour to a thin paste with some of the milk. Put the
remaining milk in a saucepan with the chocolate and sugar, and stir
over a gentle heat until the chocolate melts and the sugar dissolves.

Add cornflour paste carefully and bring mixture to boil to thicken,
stirring continuously, then remove from heat.

Beat in egg yolks one by one, and leave mixture to cool slightly.
(You can prepare in advance this far and if needed warm the mixture
slightly before continuing.)

Beat egg whites until they begin to stand in soft peaks, then add
extra sugar and beat until the mixture stands in stiff peaks but is
not dry. Fold into chocolate mixture gently.

Immediately pour into greased and sugared 1 litre souffle dish (with a
paper collar), and bake at 190 degrees celsius for 40 - 45 minutes.
Serve immediately.
