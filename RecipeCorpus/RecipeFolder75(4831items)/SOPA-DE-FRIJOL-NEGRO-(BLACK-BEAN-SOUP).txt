Title: SOPA DE FRIJOL NEGRO (BLACK BEAN SOUP)
Categories: Soups/stews, Cuba, Update
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Dried black beans
2 qt Cold water
2 c  Coarsely chopped onion
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped scallions,
-including green tops
3 md Cloves garlic, minced
1 ea Smoked ham hock
2 ea Bay leaves, crumbled
Salt to taste
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 ea Scotch bonnet-type chile,
-seeded
1/2 c  Dark rum
Pick over the beans, rinse them, and put them in a large heavy pot
with the water. Cover the pot and bring the water quickly to a boil.
Stir the beans, remove them from the heat, and allow them to sit for
1 hour. When the beans have softened, return the pot to the heat,
adding more boiling water if necessary. Then add the remaining
ingredients, with the exception of the rum. Continue to cook,
covered, over low heat for several hours, until the beans are very
tender and the ham falls off its bone. Remove from the heat and
remove the ham hock bone and meat. Dice the meat finely and discard
the bone. Press the remaining ingredients through a food mill, taste
for seasoning, and add the diced ham. At this point, the soup can rest
overnight in the refrigerator so that the flavors mingle, or it can be
served at once. To serve, reheat the soup for 5 minutes while
stirring in the rum. Side dishes of lemon wedges, cooked white rice,
minced onion, or chopped hard-boiled eggs can be served as garnishes.
