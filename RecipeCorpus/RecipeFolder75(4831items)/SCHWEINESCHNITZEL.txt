Title: SCHWEINESCHNITZEL
Categories: Pork, German
Yield: 6 Servings
4    (6-ounce) pork cutlets
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper to taste
Flour for dredging
1    Egg
1 ts Water
1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
4 tb Butter or margarine
1 tb Capers
Lemon wedges
Pound the cutlets until thin.  Sprinkle lightly on both sides with
salt and pepper.  Dredge them lightly but thoroughly in flour.

Beat the egg lightly with the water and dip the floured cutlets in the
mixture; coat with crumbs. Using the side of a kitchen knife, tap the
cutlets lightly so the crumbs will adhere well to the meat. Transfer
them to a wire rack.  Refrigerate for one or two hours. This will
help the breading adhere to the cutlets when they are being cooked.

Heat the butter in a large skillet and, when it is hot but not brown
or smoking, saute the cutlets in it until they are golden brown on
both sides.

Arrange the cutlets on a heated serving platter and garnish with the
capers and lemon wedges.  Serve immediately.

Serves four.
