Categories: Pudding, Southwest
Yield: 8 Servings
14    Slices of bread
2 c  Sugar
3 1/2 c  Water
1 ts Cinnamon
5 tb Butter
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Pinon or pecan nuts
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1 c  Shredded Cheese,
-Jack or Longhorn
1 c  Whipped cream, for garnish
1/2 c  Sweet wine  (optional)
Butter oven-proof baking dish.  Tear bread into 1-inch pieces and
toast in 350 F oven for 10 minutes. Toss bread and nuts in a mixing
bowl. Place sugar in saucepan over medium heat and stir continuously
until sugar melts and turns caramel color. Add water immediatly,
being VERY carefull because the caramel will bubble and splatter.
Caramel may partially solidify but will liquify as it reheats. Reduce
heat and add raisins, vanilla and butter to caramel syrup while still
hot. Stir until butter melts and pour syrup mixture over bread
mixture.  If not entirely soaked, add sweet wine as needed.  Place
mixture in baking dish and top with cheese. Bake at 350 F for 30
minutes. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream. WALT New Mexico
