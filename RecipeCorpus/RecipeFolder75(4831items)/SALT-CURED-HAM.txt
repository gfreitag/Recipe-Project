MMMMM-----------------------CURING PROCESS----------------------------
Okay, Gary,
To salt down a ham you will again need a FRESH ham.
If at all possible, find some Jefferson Island Salt.
We have less trouble loosing hams when we use that.
If not, use canning salt -- DO NOT USE IODIZED SALT.
For each ham use two pints of salt.  Rub salt in well to all sides
of ham, filling bone cavity.
I suppose that I should have told you prior to
(cont) >>
this that you have to have a salt box constructed of wood -- a very
strong salt box.  It may have to withstand the assault of
neighborhood dogs.
Box should be large enough to hold hams in a single layer. (Ours is
3'x5' on the bottom and about 2' high.) Size doesn't matter much as
long as hams don't butt up against each other and it's not so small
On to curing:  You will have salt
that the dogs can move it.
left after rubbing on hams. Place a thin layer of the salt in the
bottom of the box. Place ham on this, skin side down.  Pour the >>>
remaining salt on the ham. Place top on box and secure. Find a handy
calendar and mark down three weeks. Okay, ham comes up then. Wash
salt off ham and LIBERALLY coat with black pepper. (Use dust mask
from workshop if pepper bothers you.) Place in cloth sack (old pillow
case will do nicely) and hang. Do not cut for at least 6 months, 1
year is better.
All of this should be done when the temp is 35 to 50 degrees.
Good luck.  No guarantees.  (Sugar cure is better!)
