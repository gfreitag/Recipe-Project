Recipe by: Deborah Rech Original recipe called for 2 T butter or
margarine instead of Wonderslim.

I use the standard bread cycle, light crust setting.

This loaf is milder than whole wheat, but has more character than
white bread.  If you choose to use whole wheat flour (which I think
would overwhelm the flavor of the spelt), you would need to add a
little gluten to help the rise -- maybe one rounded tablespoon.
