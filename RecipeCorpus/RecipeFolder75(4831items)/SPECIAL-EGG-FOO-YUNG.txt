Combine omelet ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix well.

Heat 7 inch skillet with 2 ts. oil at medium to high heat. Pour 1/2 of
mixture in pan, spreading to even thickness. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes,
until lightly browned. Turn and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes.
Remove, and cook the second half of the mixture.

The meat/vegetables can vary, though the bean sprouts are a "must".

Do not expect the mixture to wait long.  It will turn watery, and
should be used as soon as possible.

Serve with Foo Yung sauce and rice, but each is optional.
