Time: 3:00 Put the tamarind into a bowl and pour boiling water over
it. Set aside until it is cooled. Pour the contents of the bowl
through a strainer into a bowl, pressing as much of the pulp through
as possible. Set the liquid aside. Cut steak into 1" pieces. Mix
brown sugar, molasses, and dark soy sauce and set aside. Heat the oil
in a wok. When it is hot, add the onions and fry, stirring
occasionally, until they are soft. Add the garlic, ginger, spices and
pepper and fry for three minutes, stirring frequently. Add the meat
and increase the heat to moderately high. Cook the meat, turning from
time to time, until it is deeply and evenly browned. Stir in the
remaining ingredients, including the reserved tamarind liquid, and
bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer
for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is cooked through and tender
and the sauce is thick and rather rich in texture. Remove from heat,
transfer the mixture to a large, warmed serving platter and serve at
once.
