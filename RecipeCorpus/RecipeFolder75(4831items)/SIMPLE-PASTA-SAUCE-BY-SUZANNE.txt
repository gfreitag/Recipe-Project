Title: SIMPLE PASTA SAUCE BY SUZANNE
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Olive oil
1    Clove garlic, crushed
1/2 c  White wine
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
1    Chopped tomato
x  Fresh ground pepper
x  Basil
In a sauce pan that has heated for a minute, add 1 tsp olive oil and 1
clove garlic, crushed.  Cook until the garlic just turns brown.
[optional]

Add (or start out with):  1/2 cup white wine and cook until it is
reduced by half. (Most of the alcohol is gone by this point, but
there is still good flavor.) Add 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and one
chopped tomato and cook for two minutes more.

It is really simple and leaves a lot of flavor for the pasta. I also
like to add fresh ground pepper and basil, You should experiment with
the spices you like. I don't think they take away too much from the
flavor of the pasta.  I hope you try it!
