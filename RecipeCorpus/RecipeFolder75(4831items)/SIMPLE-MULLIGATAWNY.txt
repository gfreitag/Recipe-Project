Clean chicken and cut into 8 or more parts. In a dutch oven, bring to
a boil with cold water. Add some salt and let simmer for about 2 1/2
hours. Skim off foam. Remove skin and bones from chicken parts;
transfer meat to a large soup bowl. De-fat the chicken broth Slice
the onions thinly and fry in the ghee until golden brown. Add to the
chicken in the soup bowl. Blend curry paste with a little broth, then
stir into the remaining broth; bring to a boil. Pour hot soup over
onions and chicken in the bowl. The amount of curry paste should be
adapted to your taste, but in general the soup should be fairly hot.
Indian-style curry-paste is best, but any Thai-style paste will do as
well.
