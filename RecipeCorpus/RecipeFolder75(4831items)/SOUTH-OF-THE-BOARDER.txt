Title: SOUTH OF THE BOARDER
Categories: Mexican, Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Hot pepper
8 oz Cream cheese
1/3 c  Chopped black olives
Directions: Prepare about 2 tsp. of the hot pepper by chopping it up.
Remember: the "heat" is in the seeds and membranes inside, so if you
want to keep it relatively mild remove all of that. Using an electric
mixer, blend all the ingredients. Smear the mess evenly on a flour
tortilla and roll it up. Chill in the refrigerator. To serve, cut the
roll into little log segments and serve with some mild salsa.
