Title: SAUTEED BUFFALO STEAKS & CHOPS
Categories: Game
Yield: 4 Servings
Buffalo steaks or chops
1/4 c  Butter
Salt & pepper
Melt butter in a heavy skillet. Saut√© steaks or chops until nicely
browned on both sides. Turn as often as needed. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Serve immediately.

These cuts are cooked best when the center of the meat is light pink.
Do not crowd pieces in the pan. Overcooking makes buffalo tough.
