Title: SICILIAN SWEET & SOUR PUMPKIIN SQUASH
Categories: Vegetarian, Side dish, Ornish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Pumpkin or butternut squash
Salt and pepper
1 1/2 c  Vegetable stock
2    Onions; thinly sliced
6 tb Sugar
2/3 c  Red wine vinegar
1/2 c  Fresh mint; chopped
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cut the pumpkin in half and remove
the seeds. Place the pumpkin cut side down on a baking sheet. Bake
about 45 minutes or until tender but not mush. The pump0kin flesh
should be firm enough to cut into 1/2-inch cubes or slices. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper.

Bring 1 cup of the stock to a boil in a suacepan and cook the onions
in it, uncovered, over moderate heat until tender. When most of the
liquid has evaporated, sprinkle the onions with sugar and cook until
the onions begin to caramelize. Add the vinegar and the remaining
stock and continue to cook until deep golden brown but not burned.
Add water if teh mixture seems dry; the onions should end up in a
sweet and sour syrup. Toss the pumpkin cubes with the onions mixture
and stir well to coat. Sprinkle with coarsely chopped mint.
