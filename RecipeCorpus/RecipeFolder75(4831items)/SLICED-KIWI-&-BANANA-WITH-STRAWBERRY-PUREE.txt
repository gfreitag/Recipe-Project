Title: SLICED KIWI & BANANA WITH STRAWBERRY PUREE
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pt Strawberries, hulled
Water
1 tb Cornstarch
3    Bananas
1    Juice of 1/2 lemon
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
6    Kiwis
Place strawberries in blender with lemon juice and 1/4 cup water.
(Thawed unsweeted strawberries could be substituted). Blend until
smooth. Press through fine strainer into medium-sized saucepan.
(Sauce foams as it cooks, so you will need the extra space).  Add
sugar to mixture; bring to a boil. Lower heat; simmer 5 minutes. Mix
cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water; stir into mixture 1 to 2 minutes
or until thickened. Remove from heat. Cool and chill. Just before
serving, peel kiwis and bananas. Place several tablespoons for
strawberry mixture in corner of each dessert plate. Slice 1 kiwi and
half a banana into overlapping semicircles around each pool of sauce.
(If you have any strawberry mixture left over, it's delicious on ice
cream).
