Title: SNAP PEAS WITH SESAME OIL
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Sugar snap or snow peas
Salt
Sesame oil
Chopped parsley or cilantro
CUT ACROSS THE STEM END of the peas and pull off the string that runs
along the length of the pea. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt
and the peas. Blanch until the peas turn bright green and are
tender-crisp, after a minute or so. Taste to make sure--the time will
depend on the type of pea and how mature it is. Scoop them out with a
strainer and shake off as much excess water as possible. Put them in
a bowl and toss with just enough oil to lightly coat, a teaspoon or
so. Add the parsley or cilantro and serve. For a variation, make the
recipe using peanut oil or a fine olive oil tossed with basil rather
than cilantro.
