Categories: Appetizers, Indian
Yield: 1 Recipe
3 tb Ghee*

Rub the ghee into the flour.  Stir in salt & baking powder & continue
to rub until you have a crumbly texture. Gradually add water as
necessary & knead into a stiff but pliable dough. Divide dough into
four equal portions & shape into a ball.  Flatten each portion & then
roll out into a thin, round disk.  Cut each disk in half & set aside,

vegetable oil.
