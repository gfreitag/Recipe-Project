Cut the beef into 1/2 inch strips; put in a plastic bag with 3 tb of
flour and the salt.  Shake until the meat is evenly coated. In a
heavy skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil; add the meat strips and brown
slowly, stirring often. Add the onion, garlic, Coca-Cola and 1/4 cup
of water; mix well. Cover andsimmer for 30 to 45 minutes or until the
meat is fork tender. In a bowl, mix the 2 tb of flour with the 1/2
cup of water until smooth. Stir into the meat along with the
Worcestershire sauce and the undrained mushrooms. Stir and cook until
thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. (If making ahead for reheating later, do
not add the sour cream now. Reheat, then complete the recipe
directions.) Stir in the sour cream and heat gently just until the
gravy simmers.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve over mashed potatoes,
noodles or rice. From: "International Cooking with Coca-Cola", a give
