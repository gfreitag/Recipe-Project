And while you're posting elsewhere, here's a great MW fish recipe if
you need to get fancy - or even if you want to treat yourself - while
waiting for the guts to be back in your kitchen. Zap everything but
fish in MW safe dish (I use clear glass) until almonds are brown (5-7
min.) Lay fish fillets on mixture & coat both sides, then zap for 6
min. (No need to turn them while cooking.) Serve with rice.
