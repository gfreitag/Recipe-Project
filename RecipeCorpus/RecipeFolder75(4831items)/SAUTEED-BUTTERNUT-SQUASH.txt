Title: SAUTEED BUTTERNUT SQUASH
Categories: Seasonings, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 lb Butternut squash, seeded
;cut in 1" chunks
;(abt. 3 1/2 cups)
1 lg Garlic clove, minced
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tb Fresh sage, chopped
1 tb Italian parsley, chopped
In a heavy (preferably non-stick) skillet, heat oil until sizzling.
Add squash and garlic and toss to coat well with oil. Saute slowly
over low heat, stirring frequently, for about 30 minutes, until
squash is golden and tender.  (Add a tablespoon or two of water to
pan if squash begins to stick.)  Add salt and pepper to taste, then
sprinkle sage and parsley over squash and mix to combine well.

Shepherd writes: "Slow cooking brings out the butternut's natural
sugars, and fresh sage adds a wonderful contrasting flavor accent."
