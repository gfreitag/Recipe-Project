-kneading
3/4 c  Cold water
2 tb Lard, softened
1/4 c  Minced scallion, with tops *
2 md Cloves garlic, minced
Salt
4 tb Peanut oil
Makes 2  10 inch cakes

Place 2 cups flour in medium bowl; add 3/4 cup water in thin steady
stream, stirring constantly until mixture forms rough dough. Turn out
onto lightly floured surface; knead, adding flour as necessary to
prevent sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
Allow dough to rest under kitchen towel 15 minutes.

Divide dough in half; keeping one half covered, roll other half out
on a lightly floured surface to 10 x 6 rectangle, long side facing
you. Spread rectangle with 1 Tbsp. of the lard. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp.
of the scallion, half the garlic, and salt to taste.  Roll rectangle
toward you into tight cylinder, jelly-roll fashion: pinch seams and
ends to seal. Repeat with other piece of dough.  Shape each roll into
a coil; fasten end to coil by pinching.  Refrigerate, wrapped in
plastic, 30 minutes.

Remove coils from refrigerator; using hands, roughly shape one coil
into ball.  Roll out on generously floured surface to circle 10
inches in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick; avoid rolling over edges
of dough. Brush off excess flour.  Repeat with other dough.

Heat 2 Tbsp. of the oil in large heavy skillet over medium-high heat
until fragrant.  Add on cake; immediately reduce heat to medium. Fry
cake, shaking pan occasionally, until underside is golden brown,
about 3 minutes. Turn cake over; fry until second side is golden
brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper toweling to drain. Wipe
skillet clean; add remaining oil and fry second pancake.  Cakes can
be served either warm or at room temperature.

* 1 Tbsp. minced fresh coriander leaves can be added to the scallion.
