Recipe by: EMERIL LIVE SHOW #EMIA13  Heat the oil in a large cast iron
skillet. Season the chicken with salt and cayenne. Whisk the eggs
with 2 tablespoons of the milk. Season the beaten eggs and 3 cups of
the flour with Essence. Dredge the chicken pieces in the season
flour, coating each piece completely. Dip the chicken in the egg
wash, coating completely and letting the excess drip off. Dredge the
chicken in the seasoned flour, coating the chicken completely. Gently
lay half of the chicken in the hot oil, skin side down. Fry the
chicken for 6 minutes. Turn the chicken over and continue to cook for
6 minutes or until the chicken is golden brown and the chicken is
completely cooked. Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season the chicken with Essence. Continue frying
the remaining chicken. Carefully pour off the oil, leaving about 1/2
cup of the oil remaining in the pan, leaving the chicken debris in
the pan. Whisk in the remaining 12 cup of the flour and cook for 3 to
4 minutes. Whisk in the remaining milk. Bring the liquid up to a boil
and reduce to a simmer. Season with salt and black pepper. Cook the
gravy for 6 to 8 minutes. If the gravy is too thick add a little
water to thin the gravy. Serve the chicken and gravy with mashed
potatoes.
