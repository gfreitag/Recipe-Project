Title: SALM NACH BASLER ART / SALMON BASEL STYLE
Categories: Swiss, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Pieces filleted salmon
1/2    Lemon
Salt
2 tb Flour
Pepper
2    Onions (in thin-cut rings)
50 g  Butter
3 tb Oil
1 dl Fish stock
Season the fillets with salt and pepper, squeeze the lemon juice over
them, and leave to marinate for a short time.

Dredge the onion rings in the flour. Shake off the excess.

Dredge the fish in the remaining flour, then brown quickly in the
combined butter and oil for 5-6 minutes on each side. Brown the onion
rings as well (after the fish have been removed from the pan).

Arrange the fish on a warm plate and cover with the onion rings.
Deglaze the pan with the fish stock and serve as a sauce over the
salmon.

Serve with boiled potatoes.
