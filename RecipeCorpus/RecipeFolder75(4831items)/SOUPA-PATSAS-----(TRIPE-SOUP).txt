(TRIPE SOUP)
Title: SOUPA PATSAS
Categories: Soups, Greek
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Honeycomb tripe
8 ea Lamb's feet
6 cl Garlic (opt.) or to taste
Coarse salt
3 ea Eggs
2 ea Lemons, juice only
Pepper to taste
Vinegar (opt.)
Oil (opt.)
Clean, scrape, and wash the tripe and feet.  Scald in boiling
water; cool.  Cut the tripe into small pieces, place in a large pot
with the feet, cover with plenty of water; bring to a boil, skimming
off the froth as it rises.  Lower the heat.  Add the garlic, and cook
at a slow boil for 1 to 2 hrs., adding a little coarse salt just
before the meat is tender. Remove the pot from the heat; strain the
broth and reserve. Remove and discard the bones from the feet; cut
the meat into 3 or 4 pcs.; return to the broth.

Prepare the avgolemono as follows:  Beat the eggs very well.
Slowly add the lemon juice to them, beating all the while. Add a
little hot broth from the pot, stirring constatly, then pour the
mixture back into the soup. Add pepper just before serving.

NOTE:  This soup, very light in color, can be served not only hot
but cold.  For the latter, let it jell, then cut into squares or
diamonds for serving. When it is served hot, some people prefer it
mixed with oil and vinegar, instead in avgolemono.
