Title: SAVOURY AUBERGINE (EGGPLANT) ON TOAST
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Serving
1/2 sm Eggplant
1 sm Onion
1 tb Olive oil
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Whole wheat toast
Put the halved aubergine (eggplant) cut side down on a baking dish
(the remaining half should be immediately wrapped and refrigerated)
and bake at 400 degrees F (200 C / Gas Mark 6) for about half an
hour, by which time it should be soft.  Leave to cool.

Slice the onion thinly.  Fry the sliced onion in the olive oil in a
frying pan (skillet) until lightly browned.

Scrape the aubergine (eggplant) flesh from the skin and discard the
skin. Chop the flesh coarsely.  Add it to the frying pan (skillet),
and continue cooking for a couple of minutes longer. Season to taste
and serve immediately over hot toast.
