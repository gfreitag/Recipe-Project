Title: RUSSIAN APRICOT CHICKEN
Categories: Crockpot, Chicken, Oven meals
Yield: 4 Servings
-SUSAN LAWRENCE
Boneless chicken pieces;
-legs, thighs or breasts
1    Jar apricot jam
1    Bottle Russian dressing
1 pk Lipton onion soup mix
1 c  Water
1 lg Onion; sliced
Mix the jam, dressing, soup mix, and water together, pour over the
chicken, and bake until done. So easy, so good. I usually buy 2 small
jars of jam - 1 large bottle of dressing and slice up some 'real'
onion to add just a little cause we eat a lot of chicken. Give it a
go. IF YOU'RE A CROCKPOT COOKER, mix,leave and return to eat. I
usually buy bone-less legs due to cost. But sometimes you can get a
nice large bag of boneless chicken breast at a reasonable price. Bake
at 350 degrees for about an hour or so.
