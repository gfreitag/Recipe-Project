Title: SMÂ„LTSILL (MELTED HERRING)
Categories: Swedish, Seafood
Yield: 2 Servings
1 qt Water
1 ts Salt
4 md Boiling potatoes; peeled
2    Fillets of canned Matjes
-herring
2 tb Butter
2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
3    Radishes; finely chopped or
-thinly sliced
2    Hard-cooked eggs; whites and
-yolks chopped separately
Bring the water and salt to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan, add the
potatoes and cook uncovered. Select a heatproof plate the same
diameter as the pot to serve as a lid. Lay the herring fillets on the
plate side by side and make neat, diagonal slices through them every
1/2" without disturbing their original shape. When the potatoes are
about half-cooked (after 10 minutes or so, but test now and then with
the tip of a small, sharp knife), cover the pot with the plate of
sliced herring and continue cooking the potatoes over medium heat for
another 10 to 12 minutes or until potatoes are tender and the herring
is heated through or "melted." Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of
butter in a small saucepan. Cook slowly over moderately low heat to
brown the butter lightly. Drain potatoes, return to pan and dry over
low heat for a minute or two, shaking constantly. Place the herring
on a serving plate and garnish with chopped parsley, radishs and egg
whites and yolks. Pour the hot butter on the herring only and serve
the potatoes in a separate bowl.
