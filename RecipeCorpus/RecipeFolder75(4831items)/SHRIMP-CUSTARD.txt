shrimp. Set cups in a large baking pan at least 2" deep.

stand at least 10 minutes. If made ahead, let cool, then cover and
chill up to a day.
4. Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds in a 6-8" frying pan over medium-low
heat, shaking pan often until seed is golden, about 8 minutes; remove
from pan and set aside. Just before serving, garnish custards with
sesame seed. Offer warm or cold, with fish sauce to add to taste.
