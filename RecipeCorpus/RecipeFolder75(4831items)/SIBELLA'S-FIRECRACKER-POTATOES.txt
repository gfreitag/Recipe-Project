Title: SIBELLA'S FIRECRACKER POTATOES
Categories: Side dish, Potatoes
12    dried chile peppers -- I use
chile arbol
Yield: 4 Servings
:
2 lb Yukon Gold or other small
new potatoes
salt and pepper
:
:
10    Cloves fresh garlic --
unpeeled
:
1/2 c  chile soaking water
1/2 c  dry white wine
3    bay leaves

Rehydrate the chiles by pouring a cup or so of boiling water over
them and allowing them to sit for 5 minutes. Drain off the soaking
water but reserve
1/2    cup of it.

Leave tiny potatoes whole, halve or quarter others as you see fit.
Moisten them with water or cooking spray and toss liberally with salt
and pepper and place into a covered baking dish. Add the garlic
cloves, peppers, bay leaves, 1/2 cup of reserved chile-soaking water,
and wine. Cover and bake at 400 F until the liquid is completely
boiled away, at least 45 minutes. Uncover and broil to brown the tops
of the topmost potatoes [optional].
