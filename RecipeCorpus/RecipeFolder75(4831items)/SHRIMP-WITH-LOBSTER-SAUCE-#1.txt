Contrary to popular belief, lobster sauce does not contain lobster.
It's delicious served OVER lobster or shrimp.

Lobster Sauce:  Soak salted black beans for 10 minutes; rinse &
drain. Mash with garlic. Cut green onions in 1/2" sections. In small
bowl, beat egg with water.

Shrimp: Shell, devein & butterfly shrimp. To butterfly shrimp, slice
along the back about 3/4 of the way through the flesh with a small
paring knife. Spread shrimp open; cover but do not refrigerate.

To stir-fry, heat wok to medium-high.  When hot, dribble oil around
side of pan.  Put shrimp in wok all at once, & start tossing. Keep
shrimp in motion, so they will cook uniformly. When they just begin
to curl, remove to the serving dish.

Heat wok to medium; add remaining oil.  When oil is hot (not smoking)
add garlic/bean mixture.  Stir briskly until aroma of beans & garlic
is strong, but don't overcook. Add ground pork in little pieces;
stir-fry until cooked, about 4 minutes.  Add broth, soy sauce &
sugar, stirring while mixture comes to a boil. Thicken mixture with
corn- starch paste to create a light cream-like sauce (not too
thick). Slowly stir in beaten egg. Cook briefly.  Add shrimp. Mix and
serve.
