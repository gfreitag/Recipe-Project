Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Chicken, ca. 3.5 lbs,
-butterflied (split down
-the backbone)
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
Sprinkle chicken on both sides with saltand pepper. Fold wings
underneath to secure them. Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet large
enough to hold the flattened chicken comfortably. Put chicken in,
skin-side down, cover chicken firmly with a plate and put about 5 lbs
of weight on top of the plate. Cook over low heat until skin is
nicely browned, about 25 min. Turn chicken skin-side up, replace
weight, cook about 15 more min.

Remove chicken and pour off fat, reserving 2 Tbsp. Add flour to fat
and whisk. Gradually add chicken broth and cook until thickened.
Return chicken (skin-side up), add salt and pepper, replace plate and
weight, and continue cooking over low heat about 30 min, or until
chicken is exceptionally tender. Spoon the gravy over the chicken,
cut into serving pieces, and serve with fluffy rice.
