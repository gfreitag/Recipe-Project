Title: S'MORES
Categories: Camping, Marshmallow, Chocolate, Resort
Yield: 1 Servings
Marshmallows
Hershey bars
Graham crackers
Green sticks or coat
Hangers
Get prepared by getting 1 large graham cracker and breaking it in
half. Cover 1/2 of the graham cracker with Hershey bar.

Put a marshmallow (or 2) on the stick and hold it over the fire until
roasted. Some people like them lightly golden, others like to catch
them on fire and then blow the fire out. If you do that, be careful.
You have to put the fire out quickly or your marshmallow will fall on
the ground. When the marshmallow's roasted, place on top of the
Hershey bar, put the other graham cracker on top and bite down. Yum!
