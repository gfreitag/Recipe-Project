Title: RUSSIAN TEA CAKES (SNOWBALLS)
Categories: Cookies, Tried
Yield: 4 Dozen
1 c  Soft butter
1/2 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
1 ts Vanilla
2 1/4 c  Sifted All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Nuts, finely chopped
Extra sifted confectioner's
Sugar for covering cookies
Mix the butter, confectioner's sugar, and vanilla, thoroughly
together. Sift and stir in the flour, and salt. Then mix in nuts.

Chill dough. Roll into 1 inch balls. place on ungreased baking sheet
(cookies do not spread). Bake until set, but not brown. While still
warm, roll in confectioner's sugar. Cool. Roll in sugar again.

Temperature: 400F (mod hot oven). Time: Bake 10 to 12 minutes. Amount:
About 4 dozen, 1 1/2 inch cookies.

NOTE: When rolling dough into balls, use a light touch, and do not
handle very long. The dough will get hard, and become almost
rock-like after baking if you over-handle.

This has been a family favorite for almost 30 years. Once you start
eating them, you can't stop. I've seen and tasted many other recipes
for "Snowball" cookies, but none have measured up to this one. I've
had many "rocks" in my time!
