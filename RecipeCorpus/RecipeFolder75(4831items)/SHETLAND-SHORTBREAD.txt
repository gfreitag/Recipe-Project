Title: SHETLAND SHORTBREAD
Categories: None
Yield: 12 Pieces, de
8 oz Plain (all-purpose) flour
2 oz Self raising flour
3 oz Cornflour (cornstarch)
3 oz Castor (superfine) sugar
8 oz Butter or margarine, or a
- half/half mixture is good
Melt butter. Mix dry ingredients. Add and knead all together. Pat or
roll into baking sheet (to about 1/2" deep). Prick over with fork.
Sprinkle with sugar. Cut into 1" by 2-3" strips when taken from oven.
Bake at 350F/160C/Gas Mark 4 on bottom shelf of oven until a pale
beige colour (15- 25 minutes).

I use castor sugar not granulated and a half butter half margarine
mix to get the best results. I usually make double quantities, since
it keeps well in an air-tight tin.

Note that this does have a lighter feel than shortbreads from other
parts of Scotland.
