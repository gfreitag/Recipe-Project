Title: SIX MINUTE CHOCOLATE CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/3 c  Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
1 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
1 c  Old Water -- or brewed
Coffee
2 ts Vanilla Extract -- (pure)
2 tb Vinegar
Preheat oven to 375.

Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar into an
ungreased 8-inch square or 9-inch round cake pan. In a 2-cup
measuring cup, measure and mix together the oil, water or coffee, and
vanilla. Pour the liquid ingredients into the baking pan and mix the
batter with a fork or small whisk.  When the batter is smooth, add
the vinegar and stir in quickly. There will be pale swirls in the
batter where the vinegar is reacting with the baking soda.  Stir just
until the vinegar is evenly distributed throughout the batter. Bake
for 25 to 30 minutes.

To top the cake, I pureed a bag of (thawed) frozen raspberries and
added a few drops of lemon juice, then strained through a seive. I
was going to sprinkle some powdered sugar on top, but I realized I
didn't have any *yikes*, so i just mixed in a little regular sugar. I
spooned a little of this on top of each piece of cake (as well as
underneath it), and then sprinkled fresh raspberries on top.  It was
wonderful. The color of the pureed raspberries alone is enough to
make me love this dessert. The cake was great too-- wonderfully dark
and moist. A perfect contrast to the tartness of the berries.
