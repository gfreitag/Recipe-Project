Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until tender, then mash them
until they are quite smooth. Dissolve the sugar in the water in a
saucepan over a fairly low heat. Sift the rice flour into a large
bowl. Make a well in the centre, then add the mashed potatoes and
sugar solution. Gradually stir in the rice flour then knead the
mixture into a soft dough. Cover with cling film or a tea towel and
chill. Prepare the filling. Soak the mushrooms in cold water for 15
minutes, then drain and steam them over boiling water for 15 minutes.
Remove the mushroom stalks, then finely dice the caps. Finely dice
the pork and marinate it with the soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of the
sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of the sherry for 10 minutes. Soak and dice
the dried shrimps. Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or frying pan.
Add the pork, shallot and shrimps and fry for a while, then stir in
all the remaining filling ingredients. Roll the dough into a cylinder
shape, then cut it into 32 equal portions. Press the pieces of dough
into flat circles and place a little filling in the centre of each.
Draw up the edges of the dough, working it around the filling to seal
it in and make neat balls. Coat these completely in sesame seeds.
Heat the oil for deep frying to 190 c/375 F, then add the sesame
balls and deep fry them until golden brown. Drain and serve.
