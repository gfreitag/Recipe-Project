Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
100 g  Pistachio nuts
40 g  Butter
3    Cloves garlic
1 ts Salt
1 pn Ground cumin
1 pn Ground coriander
1 pn Ground nutmeg
1 pn Black pepper
1 pn Paprika
12    Beef kidneys
The quantities for the pistachio butter make more than you will use
for this dish but keep the leftovers in the freezer for instant
pizazz on a simple steak.

In a dry frying pan, lightly roast until fragrant 100 g pistachio nut
kernels. Stir or shake frequently to ensure they do not burn.
Transfer to a food processor and add 40 g butter and 3 cloves garlic,
crushed. Process to a smooth paste, transfer to a piece of foil and
form into a roll. Wrap in foil and refrig- erate until needed.

Make a spice salt mixture by mixing 1 teaspoon salt with a pinch each
of ground cumin, ground coriander, ground nutmeg, black pepper and
paprika.

Skin and core 12 kidneys and thread the halves lengthways on 8
skewers, 3 halves to a skewer, to keep them open and flat. Brush with
oil. Heat a grill to maximum heat and grill the skew- ers close to
the heat for about a minute on each side.

Dust the kidneys with spiced salt on both sides and grill them for a
further minute on each side or until browned but still succulent.
Remove kidneys from the skewers to warmed plates, six halves per
person, and on each half(place as much pistachio butter as it will
hold. Serve immediately.
