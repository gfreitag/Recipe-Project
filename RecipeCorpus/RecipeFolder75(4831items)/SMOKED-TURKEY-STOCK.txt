More delicate than stocks made with the more traditional smoked pork
products, ths is easy to do and makes a beautifully flavored base for
soups and casseroles.

1. In a large pot saute the onions and carrots in the oil over low to
moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are a deep
golden brown and very soft.

2. Add the turkey parts, water, and seasonings. Bring to a simmer,
then cook, uncovered, over moderate heat for about 2 to 3 hours or
until the liquid is reduced by about one-third.

3. Cool slightly, then strain. Chill the strained stock overnight,
then skim off all of the fat that has congealed at the top.
