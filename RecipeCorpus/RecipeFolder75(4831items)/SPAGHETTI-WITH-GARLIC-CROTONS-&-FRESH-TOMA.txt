2 tb Fresh mixed herbs
- (finely chopped)
400 g  Canned tomatoes
A home-made tomato sauce, with the freshness of herbs and garlic, is
an unbeatable rival to any commercial variety. This version of a
classic spaghetti dish is sprinkled with garlic crotons and is
utterly mouthwatering.

Heat the oil in a large pan and gently cook the onion in it, stirring
until it softens but not allowing it to brown. After about 6-7
minutes, stir in the crushed garlic and the herbs, and cook together
for a further 5 minutes. Add the juices from the can of tomatoes and
simmer together for 5 minutes more. Chop the tomatoes and add them to
the pan, season to taste, and pour the sauce over the hot, drained
spaghetti. Top with garlic crotons. Serve at once, on warm plates,
with grated cheese to sprinkle over the top.
