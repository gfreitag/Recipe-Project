Title: SHELLY'S MEATLOAF
Categories: Meats, Beef
Yield: 8 Servings
From: Gaye Levy ** DTXT63A
2 lb Lean ground beef
2 c  Fresh bread crumbs
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Minced onion
2    Carrots; shredded or chopped
2    Eggs
1/4 ts Pepper
4 tb A1 sauce
Preheat oven to 350. In a large bowl, mix all ingredients well. Spoon
into a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Smooth top with a spoon. Bake 1 1/2 hours. For
easier serving, let meatloaf stand at room temperature at least 5
minutes before slicing.    This recipe can be varied a lot. For
example, use cooked rice or oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs.
Instead of the milk, use tomato sauce, 1 cup of cottage cheese or 1
cup of stewed tomatoes . Naturally, various spices can be added.
Notes from Gaye: Since I love meatloaf but hate mixing it up, I
delegated the job to my husband Shelly. EVERYONE loves this meatloaf,
including non-meat eaters (like me).
