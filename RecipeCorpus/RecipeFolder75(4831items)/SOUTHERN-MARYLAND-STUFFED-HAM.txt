Title: SOUTHERN MARYLAND STUFFED HAM
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Ham
12 lb Ham, country cured
3 lb Kale
3 lb Watercress
2 lb Cabbage, green
1 bn Celery
1    Pepper, hot red
6 tb Salt
5 tb Pepper, black
2 tb Pepper, red
2 tb Mustard seed
2 tb Celery seed
2 ts Tabasco sauce
Choose a plump, thick ham with a thin layer of fat. Parboil 20
minutes. Steam and remove all skin.  Cut greens in small pieces (1"
to 1 1/2"). Chop celery and pepper fine. Blanch greens, celery and
pepper in boiling water until limp; drain well.  Add seasonings and
mix. Cool ham until you can handle it comfortably. Starting at the
butt end of the ham, cut three lengthwise slits, 2" long, all the way
through. Second row--two slits. Third row--three slits, so that one
slit for stuffing does not split into another. The ham is now ready
to be stuffed. With your fingers, push the seasoned greens into slits
first from the top, then from underneath, until you can feel all the
spaces have been filled. The remaining greens are banked over the top
of the ham.

To keep the ham in shape, use a large square of clean cloth. Place
ham, skin side up, on the cloth, fold the ends over tightly and pin.
Return to ham boiler and simmer 15 minutes to the pound. Let cool for
two hours in the pot liquor.  Chill in refrigerator overnight, in its
cloth.
