2 tb Oil
6    Sliced onions
10    Or more cloves garlic
-finely chopped
2 l  Water or chicken stock
4 sl Thick bread
From Colombia in South America, this robust soup is just about a meal
in itself on a cold night and easily rivals its better known cousin,
French onion soup.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan and gently fry 6 sliced
onions. Add 10 or more cloves of garlic, finely chopped, and continue
cooking until the onion is transparent. Pour in 2 L water or chicken
stock and simmer, covered, for half an hour. Put 4 thick slices of
coarse bread in the bottom of four large soup bowls. When the soup is
cooked, season it to taste, then break four eggs into the simmering
liquid and poach until barely set. Using a slotted spoon, lift the
eggs out onto the bread slices, then ladle the soup over the top.
Serve very hot.
