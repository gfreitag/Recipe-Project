Title: SCOTCH EGGS .001
Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 8 Servings
3 tb All-purpose flour
1 1/4 tb Finely choppped sage
1 ts Fresh Thyme OR
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1 lb Sausage
1 1/2 c  Bread Crumbs
Salt & Pepper
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
8 sm Hard-boiled eggs, shelled
Vegetable oil
Spread the flour on a piece of waxed paper.  Mix the herbs into the
sausage meat and divide into 8 pieces. In a small bowl combine the
bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Place the beaten eggs in a separate
bowl. Roll each hard- boiled egg in flour to coat all over. Flatten
each piece of sausage meat. Place a boiled egg in the center of each
sausage circle and press the sausage around the egg, covering the egg
entirely. Dip the sausage-covered eggs into the beaten eggs and then
into the bread crumbs. Roll the eggs to coat all sides. Heat the
vegetable oil in a deep pan to 360~. Fry the eggs in enough oil to
cover until golden brown. This will only take a few minutes. Drain on
paper towels. Serve warm or refrigerated. To serve, cut the eggs in
half, exposing the concentric circles of egg yolk, white, and sausage
meat.
