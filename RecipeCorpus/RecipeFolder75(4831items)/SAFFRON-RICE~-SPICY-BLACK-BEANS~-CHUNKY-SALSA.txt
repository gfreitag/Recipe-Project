1. To make the beans: In a 3 quart saucepan, combine the beans, water,
onion, carrot, green peppers, chili pepper, garlic, bay leaf, soy
sauce, cumin and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil over medium-high
heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer,
uncovered, for about 2-1/2 hours, or until the beans are tender and
almost all the liquid has been absorbed. Discard the bay leaf and set
aside the bean mixture. (May be made up to 2 days ahead; reheat
before serving). 2. To make the rice: In a 1 quart saucepan, bring
1/4 of the stock to a boil. Add the saffron. Cover, remove from the
heat and let stand for 5 min. 3. In a 2 quart saucepan over low heat,
saute the onions in the oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the
garlic and saute for 1 minute. Stir in the turmeric, then the rice.
Add the remaining 2 C stock and the saffron mixture. Bring to a boil
over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer
for 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all the liquid has
been absorbed. 4. Lightly coat 4 (8 ounce) custard cups with no-stick
spray or olive oil. Spoon about 3/4 C of the warm rice into each cup,
pressing it into the bottom and up the sides. Add about 1/2 C of the
beans to each cup. Top with more rice to cover the beans; lightly
pack it around the edges. 5. If not serving the timbales immediately,
cover each cup tightly with a piece of foil.  Set the cups on a
baking sheet and keep warm at 300 degrees (for up to 30 minutes). 6.
To make the salsa: In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, avocado,
onions, cucumbers, coriander, lime juice, oil and peppers. If not
serving immediately, cover and refrigerate. 7. To serve: Makes 4
servings. Remove the foil from the timbale. Invert each cup onto a
dinner plate. Top with the salsa and soy yogurt. Garnish with the
coriander. Serves 4.
