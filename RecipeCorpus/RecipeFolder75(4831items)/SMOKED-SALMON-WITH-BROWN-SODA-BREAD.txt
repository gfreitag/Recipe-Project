A plate of smoked salmon with brown soda bread is a calling card in
Ireland. In fact, the last thing my mother gave me as I was ending my
latest visit home was a whole smoked salmon to bring back to the
States. The greens and olive oil give a modern spin to my version of
this classic starter.  (Gerri Gilliland, author of article)
