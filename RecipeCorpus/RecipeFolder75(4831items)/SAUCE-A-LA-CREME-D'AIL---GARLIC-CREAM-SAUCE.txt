1 tb Strong stock
1 ts Parsley, chopped

There are countless versions of garlic sauce around the world. The
French ones mostly involve emulsions of eggs and oil with raw garlic,
such as aioli, a garlic mayonnaise, and rouille, which includes
roasted red capsicum. South-East Asian garlic sauces are more
waistline-friendly, usually variations on a combination of raw
garlic, vinegar and sugar. But there is one enjoyable French sauce
which is low in kilojoules and won't leave you reeking either. It's
from the era of cuisine minceur (remem- ber that?).

Cover 12 peeled cloves of garlic with water and bring to the boil.
Simmer for 10 minutes, then drain and discard the water. Return the
garlic cloves to the saucepan and add 100 g sliced mushrooms, a cup
of skim or fat modified milk, a tablespoon of very strong stock, 1
teaspoon chopped parsley, a pinch of nutmeg and salt and pepper to
taste. Simmer gently for 20 minutes then puree the mixture in a
blender or food processor. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
Good with grilled or roasted poultry.
