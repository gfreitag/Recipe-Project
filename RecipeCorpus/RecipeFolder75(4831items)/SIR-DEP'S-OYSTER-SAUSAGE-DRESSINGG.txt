Title: SIR DEP'S OYSTER-SAUSAGE DRESSINGG
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Batch
2 lg Onions
2    Garlic clove
1 pt Oysters
1 lb Sausage
Giblets; cut up fine
1 bn Celery
1 bn Scallions
2    Thyme sprig
2 tb Parsley

Mince the onions and garlic. Put the oysters in hot water until the
edges curl, then pour off the water but save it. Start browning the
sausage. Chop the oysters fine. Drain the grease off of the sausage.
Add the onions, garlic, oysters and giblets to the sausage. Cook
about 15 minutes.

Soak the bread or croutons in the oyster water and mash it. Add the
meat, and balance of ingredients. Mix. Use salt and pepper to taste.
Stuff the turkey.

This is the recept that I use for my smoked turkeys. I also sometimes
add Polish sausage to the meat, for some additional flavor. (Also, I
almost always put a little hot sauce in the stuff for flavor.)
