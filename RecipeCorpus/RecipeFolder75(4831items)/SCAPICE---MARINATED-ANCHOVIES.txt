Just about every cuisine of Europe has a recipe for oily fish steeped
in vinegar or lemon and served cold. In Spain it is escabeche. The
English have soused herrings. In southern Italy, they make scapice.

Remove the heads and gut 1 kg fresh anchovies. Wash them and set
aside on kitchen paper to dry.

When they are dry, heat oil for deep-frying. Put 3 table- spoons plain
flour in a paper or plastic bag and add salt and pepper. In batches,
put the anchovies into the bag and shake until they are coated with
seasoned flour. Shake off excess flour, then deep-fry. Drain the
cooked anchovies and lay them in a large shallow pan.

In a saucepan heat a cup of white wine vinegar with 3 cloves of garlic
crushed, 2 birdseye chillies halved lengthways and 3 tablespoons mint,
finely chopped. When the mixture comes to the boil, spoon it over the
fish. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, turning
the fish midway.

Serve as an antipasto with crusty bread.
