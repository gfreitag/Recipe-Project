Title: SIRLOIN SURPRISE
Categories: Low-cal, Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
- Barb Day
4 tb Cheese; grated cheddar
2 tb Bbq sauce; Bull's Eye spicy
4    Butter lettuce leaves
Parsley or cilantro sprigs
1 lb Ground sirloin
4 ts Green onion; minced
1 ts Cavander's spice
8    Cherry tomatoes
Select the leanest ground sirloin, or as I do, purchase a very lean
top sirloin steak and remove all visible fat and then grind at home.
(or use other type lean steak, where you cannot see any marbles of
fat in the meat). Mix the meat with the bbq sauce and the cavander's
spice. Divide the meat into 4 portions and shape into balls. Make a
depression in the center of each ball, deep enough to hold 1 Tb of
the cheese and 1 tsp of the onion. Smooth the meat over the top of
the cheese, re-forming into an elongated ball shape. A little trick
is to wet your hands to smooth the meat, as you want to be sure the
cheese is well contained in the ball and will not seep out during
cooking. Place the meat on a rack over a roasting pan, in order to
let any fat drain off. Cook the meat in a 375 degree oven for 45
minutes to 1 hour. To serve: Place one cleaned leaf of the lettuce on
each plate, and top it with the meat. garnish with the tomatoes. I
like to stick the tomatoes with a toothpick, and push them into the
meat, and I also sometimes put a few parsley or cilantro sprigs on
the plate. It is easier to stay on a weight loss campaign if the food
looks appetizing.
