Title: SHREDDED CARROT & RAISIN SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Carrots, small
1/2 c  Dark raisins; or to taste
Mayonnaise
Iceberg lettuce leaves
Scrape the carrots and then shred on the side of the grater or better
yet a food processor.  Be careful not to shred the fingers along with
the carrots.  You should have about 3 cups. Mix the carrots, raisins,
and mayonnaise in a medium bowl.  Arrange the lettuce leaves on 4
salad plates. Divide the carrot-raisin mixture into 4 parts and mound
on the lettuce leaves.
