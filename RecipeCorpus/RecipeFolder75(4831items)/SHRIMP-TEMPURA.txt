All-purpose flour
Mix cake flour with eggs and ice water until batter is slightly lumpy.
Chill. To make sauce, combine soy sauce, mirin, water and MSG in
saucepan and bring to boil. Place small amount of sauce in tiny
saucers with 1 teaspoon of grated radish on each. Set aside.

To prepare tempura, shell and devein shrimp, leaving tail, intact.
Flatten slightly with sturdy whack of cleaver or flat side of heavy
knife so shrimp will not curl while cooking. Arrange shrimp,
mushrooms, eggplant, celery, carrots, sweet potatoes and green beans
attractively on large tray or platter. Heat oil in deep kettle to
350F. Beat batter. Dip shrimp into all-purpose flour, then into
chilled batter, shaking to remove excess batter. Slip into deep fat
and fry until shrimp rise to surface. While shrimp are bobbing on
surface of oil, dollop a bit more batter on top of each shrimp and
cook until batter is crisp and slightly golden. Turn once and remove
with slotted spoon or fork and drain on wire rack. Keep hot. Dip
vegetables in flour and batter and cook in same manner. Continue to
cook and drain shrimp and vegetables, a few at a time, adjusting heat
during cooking to maintain 350 degree temperature. Keep batter cool.
To serve, place equal amount of various foods on each plate. Dip
cooked vegetables and shrimp into sauce, scooping up a bit of radish.
