Categories: Chinese, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings

1/2 lb Fresh button mushrooms
1 tb Sichuan vegetable, washed
-and minced
2    Cloves garlic, minced
8 sm Dried chilies

This dish is intended to be a simple statement using seasonal
vegetables.

Preparation:  Trim zucchini and mushrooms.  Slice zucchini in half
lengthwise, then roll-cut or simply slice on bias in thick 2" long
sections. Zucchini should be bite-size but not chunky. Cut mushrooms
in half through the stem.  Wash, then finely mince Sichuan vegetable
(this is the secret ingredient!). Rinse chilies; leave whole. Com-
bine stock, soy sauce, sherry, bean sauce, sugar, and vinegar in
bowl; reserve.

Stir-frying:  Heat oil in very hot wok.  Just before oil smokes, add
zucchini, mushrooms, Sichuan vegetable, garlic, and chilies; stir-fry
for about 1 minute, tossing continuously so vegetables do not scorch.
Add liquid ingredients; bring to boil; dribble in cornstarch paste to
make a light sauce (it should not have a gravy look); then combine
sauce well with vegetables.  Serve when zucchini is still slightly
undercooked.
