1. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or grease and dust with
flour. Trace ten 2-1/2-inch circles, 2 inches apart, on paper; set
aside.

Choix Pastry: In heavy saucepan, bring water, butter and salt just to
boil over high heat; remove from heat. Add flour all at once; stir
vigorously with wooden spoon until mixture comes away from side of
pan in smooth ball.

2. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, for 2
minutes or until coating begins to form on bottom of pan. Turn out
into large bowl; stir for 30 seconds to cool slightly.

3. Make a well in centre of flour mixture. Using electric mixer, beat
in eggs, one-quarter at a time, beating well after each addition;
beat until smooth, shiny, and pastry just holds its shape when lifted.

4. Using large pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch wide star tip and
starting at centre, pipe pastry to fill each circle, raising bag
while continually piping to form 2 smaller circles on top to resemble
beehive. (Or drop by 1/4 cup, spreading with spoon to cill circle and
shaping to form beehive.

5. Glaze: Beat egg with water; brush quickly over pastry, making sure
none drips onto paper. Bake in 425F 220C oven for 20 minutes. Reduce
heat to 375F 190C; Bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden and crisp.
with sharp knife, pierce small hole in side of each. Bake 5 minutes.
Turn off oven; let cream puffs stand in oven for 10 minutes to dry.
Transfer to rack; let cool.

6. Chocolate sauce: Meanwhile, in heavy saucepan, bring cream to
boil. Pour over chocolate in bowl, whisking until melted.

[Sauce can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 2 weeks;
reheat gently to liquify.]

Cut cream puffs in half horizontally. Scoop sherbet into bottom half;
replace top. Drizzle with chocolate sauce.

Variation: Frozen Ice-Cream Puffs: Remove moist bits of dough inside
cream puffs. Substitute 4 cups vanilla, chocolate or raspberry ice
cream for sherbet. Freeze for at least 2 hours or until solid; wrap
individually and store in airtight container for up to 1 week. To
serve, let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before drizzling
with hot chocolate sauce. Source: Canadian Living magazine, Nov 95
