My wife and I have chicken several times a week. Here is a favorite
recipe that I fix with several variations. (Cube the chicken and
saute with the seasonings, finish recipe and use as a burrito
filling!) Sprinkle both sides chicken with 1 ts of cumin and garlic
salt. Heat oil in 12" skillet over medium high heat. Cook chicken 3
min.

In medium bowl combine beans, corn, picante sauce, red pepper and
remaining tsp cumin. Turn chicken. Spoon bean muxture evenly over
chicken.

Reduce heat to medium. Cook uncovered 6 to 7 minutes until chicken is
cooked through. Push bean mixture off chicken into skillet. Transfer
chicken to serving platter, using a slotted spoon. Keep warm. cook
bean mixture over high heat 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until
thickened. Spoon bean mixture over chicken. Sprinkle with cilantro.
