1 lg Onion -- finely chopped
2    Carrots -- finely chopped
1    Celery stalk -- finely

2    Whole cloves

1. Combine all ingredients in a large pot. Bring to a simmer,
stirring once or twice. Do not boil.

2. Partially cover pan and simmer gently for 45 minutes. Do not stir
or skim broth while it cooks.

3. Strain broth through a cheesecloth-lined colander or wire-mesh
sieve. To use broth immediately, blot up liquid fat from surface by
touching the globules lightly with a paper towel. If you're not using
it the same day, refrigerate it; spoon off the fat when it solidifies
on the surface.

4. Store in refrigerator several days, or freeze up to
8    months.

Makes 8 cups.
