Last night I made soup.  My version of a type of minestrone. I got a
package of Knorr Vegetable soup mix, put 8 cups of water and 1 can of
low sodium beef broth, defatted, brought this to a boil, then added a
sliced leek, 1/4 head of sliced cabbage, 1 stalk of sliced celery,
some alfalfa sprouts, 2/3 cups each of barley and small shell
macaroni, a little oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme and some pepper.
Simmered it for about 2 hours.  It made the best, THICK, vegetable
soup! I have a huge bowl in the freezer, and two big containers in
the fridge for lunches this week.
