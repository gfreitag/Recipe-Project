Saute the onions and the garlic with some water until the onions
beginto get translucent.  Add the potatoes and 1/4 cup of water, the
peppers and the mushroom, cover and let simmer until the potatoes
begin to get soft over medium flame (about 15 minutes).  Add the
tomatos and some black pepper (if you have some hot sauce,now is
thetime to add it). Keep cooking until the potatoes are desired
firmness. This is excellent with your favorite salsa mixed in.  It
also goodif you have some of the fat free sour cream if you want it.
Lisa made this for me, it was satifsying, filling, and a great way to
start my day. I heartily recommend it! Fatfree Digest [Volume 5 Issue
