Title: SIMPLE TOMATO SAUCE
Categories: Pasta, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
1/3 c  Unsalted butter
1 sm White onion, thinly sliced
Crosswise
3 tb Water
1 lb Plum Tomatoes, thinly sliced
Lengthwise or
Canned plum tomatoes drained
And chopped
Salt
8    Fresh Basil leaves torn into
Pieces
In a large frying pan over medium heat,  melt the butter. Add the
onion and the water, cover and cook gently stirring occasionally,
until tender and completely translucent, about 10 minutes.  (Adding
water and covering the pan helps keep the onion from burning.)

Add the tomatoes, cover partially and cook over low heat until a
creamy consistency is achieved, about 20 minutes (How long this takes
will depend on how much water the tomatoes contain.) If the sauce
begins to dry to much before the creamy state is achieved, add a few
tablespoons water to the pan.

Add salt to taste and the basil and stir well.  Remove from the heat
and let stand, covered, for a few minutes so the basil can release
its aroma.
