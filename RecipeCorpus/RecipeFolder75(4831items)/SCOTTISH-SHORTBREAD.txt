"Our winner, Patricia Ralston who is originally from Glasgow,
Scotland, fits the bill with her mother's recipe. It's crisp, crumbly
and buttery. Patricia recommends a food processor for a lighter
product. (she weighs the ingredients). Make traditional rounds or
slice dough into cookies and bake about 18 minutes. Never grease the
baking sheets."

In a food processor or by hand, cream butter and sugar together until
light and fluffy. Sieve cornstarch and flour together and gradually
beat into creamed mixture. Knead until smooth. press into 12 X 8
square pan. Smooth top and mark into "fingers". prick with fork. Bake
at 325F for 50 minutes. If shortbread starts to brown, turn down to
300F. Recut fingers and dredge with fruit sugar while still warm.
Cool in pan.
