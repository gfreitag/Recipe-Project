Categories: Chicken/, Legs
Yield: 4 Servings
4 ea Full chicken leg
-per person, (thigh

1 c  Dry, fine bread crumbs

Thoroughly mix the seasonings with the bread crumbs. If the mixture
is very dry, blend in about 1 tbs vegetable oil. Without removing it,
carefully lift the skin and stuff the bread mixture between the skin
and flesh. About 1 tbs of crumbs is about all that is needed for

Place the stuffed legs on an ovenproof tray and bake at 375 degrees
for 45 minutes to an hour. Serve hot for dinner or cold for a picnic.
