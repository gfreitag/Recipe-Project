Then cut it in three layers. Sprinkle some kirsch on the lowest
layer. Whip the cream with some sugar. Drain the cherries. Cover two
lowest layers with 2 cm of cream and put the cherries on them. On the
top layer put only cream, and the tablespoon of chocolate. Make
rosettes with the rest of the cream and put in on top with a cherrie

trouble.
