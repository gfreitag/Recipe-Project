Title: SALTED-COD PUDDING
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Cod, salted
1/4 c  Rice
1 1/4 c  Milk
3 lg Eggs
Butter
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Boil the salted cod until fully
cooked. Take it out of the water and leave to cool. Skin the fish,
de-bone it and make a stew out of it in a bowl, not adding anything.

Boil the rice and mix it with the fish in the bowl to make a good
mixture.

Beat the eggs and mix it with the milk.

Put the fish/rice mixture in a heat-resistant dish in which you have
spread the butter.  Pour the milk/egg mixture over it and put it in
the oven for 40 minutes.

NOTES:

*  A rich pudding with salt cod, eggs and milk -- This was cooked on
a TV program a few days ago and is very nice.

*  Icelandic saltfish is mostly exported to Spain, Portugal and Italy,
where it is used in Christmas main dishes. Here in Iceland we just
boil it, and usually eat it with boiled potatoes and boiled turnips,
cut in pieces. As the fish is a bit dry we use butter with it, and
sometimes brown bread.

*  If you cannot get salt cod, you can make your own by salting a cod
fillet and leaving it in the salt, refrigerated, for 3 or 4 days,
then wash thoroughly.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
