cumin seeds in a clean coffee grinder and add to the mixture.

Put the spice mixture into a pan and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat

thicken. Add the coconut milk, salt, kokum or tamarind paste and

Add the prawns and simmer, stirring now and then, until they turn
opaque and are just cooked through.

TIPS

If you buy unpeeled headless prawns you will need 1
1/2    lb.

Kokum is the semi-dried sour skin of a fruit that grows along India's
coast. Tamarind paste makes a good substitute.

Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India - Goa

When I arrive in Goa, the first dish I order is this simple prawn
curry. It uses no oil, as nothing in it requires frying or sauteing.
In many ways, it is the humblest of curries and may also be made with
very cheap fish cut into chunks, fish steaks or fillet pieces. I like
it made with juicy prawns, fresh from the sea. With a spicy red
coconutty sauce flowing over a bed of white pearly rice - what else
can one want? I rarely order this dish in the hotel that I stay in. I
find a small beach shack covered with palm thatching, generally owned
by real fishermen, and order it there. All I need with it is a cold
glass of beer.
