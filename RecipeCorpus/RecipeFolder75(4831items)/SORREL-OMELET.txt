Title: SORREL OMELET
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
20    Sorrel leaves
- the stems removed
3 ts Butter
3    Eggs
2 tb Water
Salt
Freshly milled pepper
2 tb Cream
CUT THE SORREL LEAVES into strips, melt half the butter in an omelet
pan and cook the leaves until they have wilted and turned a
gray-green color. This will take just a minute or two. Lightly beat
the eggs with the water, season with salt and pepper, then stir in
the sorrel. Melt the remaining butter in the omelet pan and when it
is hot, add the eggs. As the edges cook, pull them into the middle of
the pan with a fork, tilting the pan as you do so that uncooked eggs
will flow into its place. When the eggs are cooked, fold the omelet
in thirds and turn it out onto a plate. Return the pan to the fire
and add the cream. Bring it to a boil and let it reduce enough just
to thicken slightly. Make a slice down the center of the omelet, pour
in the cream and serve.
