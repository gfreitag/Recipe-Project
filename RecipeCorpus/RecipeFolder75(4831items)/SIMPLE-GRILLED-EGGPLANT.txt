Title: SIMPLE GRILLED EGGPLANT
Categories: Side dishes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 lb Eggplant
1/3 c  Olive oil; virgin
1/4 c  Italian parsley; chopped
Salt; to taste
Parsley; finely chopped
Freshly ground black pepper
Recipe by: Joel.Ehrlich@salata.com (Joel Ehrlich) If using large
eggplant, remove the stems, then slice the eggplants horizontally
1/2" thick. Small eggplants should be sliced vertically 1/2" thick.
Place the eggplant slices in a large, heavy plastic bag such as a
freezer bag. Add the olive oil, salt and pepper to the bag, close the
top and toss the eggplant with the seasonings until the slices are
evenly coated. Preheat a grill. Grill the eggplant slices over
medium-high heat until tender and attractively browned. Do not allow
them to char. For a picnic, layer the grilled eggplant slices in a
large, shallow plastic container and sprinkle each layer with the
parsley. Alternatively, arrange the slices on a platter and sprinkle
with parsley. Serve at room temperature.
