PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Rinse flounder, shrimp and scallops and set
aside on a paper towel. Melt butter in a skillet, stir in the flour
and cook until tan. Stirring constantly, gradually add the fish
stock. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced
by half, stirring as needed. Add the wine and season to taste with
salt and pepper. Add a little of the hot sauce to the egg yolks and
then stir the yolks back into the sauce. Stir for a moment over low
heat without overcooking the yolks. Strain if necessary. You can make
4 individual pouches or one large one. Cut 8 small or 2 large sheets
of parchment paper or aluminum foil. Brush half with the oil. Place
the fillets side by side in the middle of the large sheet, or one
fillet on each small sheet. Place 1/4 of the shrimp, scallops,
mushroom, green onion and parsley on top of each fillet. Spoon the
sauce liberally over the seafood and top with the reserved green
onion. Top with a similar sheet of parchment paper, securing tightly,
so that no juice can escape. May be made ahead to this point and
refrigerated. Place the pouches on an oiled baking sheet and bake
until the paper browns, about 10 minutes. Serve in the pouch slitting
the pouch at the table, or open the pouch and turn onto a plate or
the serving platter just before serving. Serve this with boiled rice
(See RECIPE).
