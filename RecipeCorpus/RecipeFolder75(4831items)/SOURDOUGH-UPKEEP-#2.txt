Recipe by: KKPD13B    Linda Caldwell I've found another interesting
quote from Donna German regarding the feeding and care of your
sourdough starter. "If you're using the culture every month or so,
you don't have to feed it at all.  If the relationship sours, so to
speak, and you decide to break it off for a while, the question of
maintenance comes up in case you patch things >> over and want to
have another "wild fling" Store the culture in a refrigerator, and
then warm it up and feed it about once every 6 months. The longer it
lies dormant, the more TLC is needed to bring it back. Feeding every
12 hours for 3 to 4 days with vigorous stirring will always rescue
it." My particular starter is staging a nice comeback right now.
Think I'll do a lovely SD round loaf and bake it on my stone! Linda
