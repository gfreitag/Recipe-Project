Title: SHERRIED PEAR & CRANBERRY JAM
Categories: Fruits, Jams
Yield: 6 Cups
1 1/2 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries,
About 1/2lb (250g)
4    (or 5) ripe pears, about 2lb
5 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Sherry
1    Box Certo Crystals Fruit
Pectin
Place cranberries in a food processor and whirl, using an on-and-off
motion, until coarsely ground. Turn into a large bowl. Peel, core and
finely chop pears. They should measure about 2 cups. (Do not chop in
food processor; they will turn to mush.) Add chopped pears to
cranberries. Stir in sugar until well mixed. Let stand for 10
minutes. Then, combine water, sherry and fruit pectin crystals in a
small saucepan. Bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute, stirring
constantly. Stir into fruit mixture. Continue stirring for 3 minutes.
(There will be a few sugar crystals remaining.) Immediately pour into
jars. Cover at once with tight lids. Let stand at room temperature
until set. It may take up to 24 hours. Then, store in the
refrigerator or freezer. Jam will keep well in the refrigerator for
up to 3 weeks or in the freezer for several months. Makes 6 1/2 cups.
