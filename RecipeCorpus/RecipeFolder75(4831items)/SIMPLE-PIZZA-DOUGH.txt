Title: SIMPLE PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Pizza, Dough
Yield: 2 Pizzas
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 c  Lukewarm water
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Olive oil
In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the lukewarm water.
Let rest until foamy, about 15 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a
large bowl. Add the olive oil to the yeast mixture. Make a well in
the flour and add the yeast mixture; stir to combine. Add extra flour
if the dough seems too sticky. Knead on a floured board or countertop
until smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed. This should take
about 5 minutes.

Pat the dough into a ball, then put it into a large bowl and set it
in a warm place (near the oven), covered with a clean towel. Let the
dough rise for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in bulk.

Punch down the dough. Divide into two equal portions. Roll out the
dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface into a 12"
circle. Sprinkle a bit of cornmeal onto a pizza paddle or a dark,
heavy metal pan and put the dough on the paddle or pan. MAKES ENOUGH
CRUST FOR 2 MEDIUM PIZZAS, 8 SLICES EACH.

NOTE: The uncooked dough may be refrigerate overnight before
proceeding with the pizza recipe, or kept frozen for as long as 1
month.
