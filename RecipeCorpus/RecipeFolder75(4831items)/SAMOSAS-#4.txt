MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
4    To 5 medium size potatoes
1/2 bn Or 6 to 7 stems coriander

1/2 ts Red chili powder (optional)
1 ts Black pepper
1 c  Frozen peas
Salt to taste
2 ts Vegetable oil
Making Dough: Add pinch of salt and oil to the flour, and mix it
well. Add water slowly to flour and knead well to make a soft dough.

Making Filling: Boil potatoes.  When tender, peel and cut into small
pieces. Boil peas and set aside.  Pluck cilantro leaves, wash, chop
and set aside.  In skillet, heat oil. Add cumin seed followed by
potatoes and peas. Add salt and pepper.  Mix well and let simmer for
5 minutes. Let cool and add coriander (cilantro) leaves.

Making Samosas: Take a ball of dough and roll it round, flat and very
thin like a tortilla. Cut in half. Bring the two ends of the straight
end together in the form of a cone, and seal the end with water. Put
about 1 teaspoon of filling in the cone pocket and seal the top again
with water. Deep fry samosas in oil at medium heat until brown. Serve
with chutney or ketchup.  (You can use egg roll skins or flour
tortillas instead of making dough and use the same filling. Make into
any shape you want.) Makes 14 to
16    samosas.
