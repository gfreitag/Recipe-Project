Title: SORREL-CHIVE HERB PASTE (PESTO)
Categories: Italian, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sorrel
4 tb Finely minced shallots
4 tb Pine nuts, ground
3 tb Chopped parsley
3 tb Chopped chives
Grated peel of 4 oranges
1/4    Red onion, chopped
1 tb Dry mustard
1 ts Salt
1 ts Black pepper
Pinch cayenne
3/4 c  Olive oil
1.  Wash the sorrel and dry it well, by hand or in a salad spinner.
Chop
the sorrel coarsely, and again squeeze away any liquid.

2.  Blend the sorrel, shallots, pine nuts, parsley, chives, orange
peel
and onion in a food processor or blender.  (If using a blender, make
sure these ingredients are already finely chopped.)

3.  Add dry mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne, and mix again. SLOWLY
drizzle in the oil while the blade is moving. Transfer to tempered
glass jars and store in refrigerator (for up to 8 to
10    weeks) or in
the freezer for up to a year.

NOTES:  Sorrel's peak season is summer, although you can find hothouse
sorrel year round in some stores.  You may reduce the amount of
orange peel by 1/4 or 1/2 if you'd like to emphasize the sorrel
or other flavors.  Walnuts or almonds may be substituted for
the pine nuts.
