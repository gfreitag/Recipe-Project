Prepare the sauce first: Combine the water and stock in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil. Combine the chile powder, bacon fat and several
tablespoons of the hot stock from the other saucepan in a saucepan.
Cook, stirring steadily, over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes to
remove the raw taste from the chile powder. Stir in the tomato paste,
oregano, salt and garlic. Slowly stir in the remainder of the hot
stock from the other saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.
Adjust seasonings. Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Chop the onion and combine with the
ricotta in a bowl. Add the first measure of shredded Longhorn Cheddar.
Combine using a fork.

Heat some corn oil to 300 degrees in a deep skillet. Soften the
tortillas by passing them through the hot oil and pressing them
between towels to remove the excess oil.

Fill each tortilla with about 2/3 cup of the cheese and onion
mixture. Roll them up and place them, seam side down, in a lightly
buttered baking dish. Spoon on enough sauce to cover the tortillas.
Cover. Bake about 15 minutes. Uncover. Sprinkle the second measure of
shredded Longhorn Cheddar over. Return to the oven until the cheese
is melted (about 5 minutes). Cover with additional hot sauce. Serve
the tortillas in pairs. Place 1 fried egg on each pair of tortillas.
Garnish with shredded lettuce and sour cream.
