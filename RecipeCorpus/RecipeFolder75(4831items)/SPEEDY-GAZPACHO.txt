While this is low-cal, those of you in sunnier climates may find
this great recipe easier to enjoy these days...but I still like it
after (if and when) I come back from the health club, which I promise
to do much more often, starting next Monday! Whilrl all ingredients
in a blender of food processor ~ I like to keep them a little
"chunky", but adjust to your personal preference.  You may need to
process two batches to avoid overflow.   Pour mixture into large
pitcher; refrigerate, or add 6-7 ice cubes to hasten chilling. Serve
with a dollop of curried mayonnaise or sour cream, if your calorie
counter can handle it!
