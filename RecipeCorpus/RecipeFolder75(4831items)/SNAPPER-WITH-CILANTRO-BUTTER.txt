MMMMM------------------FOR THE CILANTRO BUTTER-----------------------
1/4 c  Unsalted butter

3 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
1 1/2 tb Fresh lime or lemon juice
1 ts Grated lime or lemon zest

Combine the butter, cilantro, lemon or lime juice and zest, salt and
pepper in a bowl and beat by hand with a wooden spoon. Shape into a
rough log about 2 inches long and 1 inch in diameter, wrap in plastic
wrap and chill until firm. Prepare a fire in the grill. Position the
oiled rack 4-6 inches above the fire. Rub the fish lightly with oil
and sprinkle to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange the fish on the
grill. Cook, turning once, about 10 minutes; the fish is done when it
turns from translucent to opaque throughout. Remove to a warmed
platter or plates. Cut the cilantro butter into 4 equal slices and
top each fillet with a slice.
