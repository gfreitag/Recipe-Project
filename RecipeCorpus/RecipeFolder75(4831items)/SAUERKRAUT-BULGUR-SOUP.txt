Armenian culture is rich in soups, many of them made tart with yogurt
and thickened with bulgur. This version is flavored with sauerkraut.
From "Armianskala Kulinaria," by A.S. Piruzian.

In 5-quart pot, saute onion in butter until golden. In bowl, soak
sauerkraut in water, drain and chop. Add to onions and cook until
done, adding water if mixture gets too dry. Add tomato puree. Saute
5-7 minutes.

Add potatoes, bulgur and stock and cook 15 minutes. Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Garnish with slight green pepper and parsley.
