Title: SCALLOP & GREEN BEAN TERRINE
Categories: Seafood, Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
10 oz Sea scallops, rinsed
1 tb Egg white, lightly beaten
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper or to taste
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/2 lb Green beans, trimmed & cut i
-to 1/4-inch pieces
2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
1 3/4 c  Creme fraiche
1/3 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
3/4 c  Tomato coulis (see recipe)
In a food processor with a metal blade, puree the scallops with the
egg white, salt, white pepper, and nutmeg. Transfer the puree to a
metal bowl and chill, covered, for 1 hour. In a saucepan, blanch the
green beans in boiling salted water to cover, for 6 minutes. Drain.
Toss the beans with 1 Tbsp butter, season them with salt and white
pepper to taste and reserve. Set the bowl of puree in a larger bowl
of ice water. Beat in 1 cup of creme fraiche, 1/4 cup at a time,
until it is incorporated and the mousse is fluffy.  Fold in the green
beans and spoon the mousse into a buttered 1-qt. terrine.  Place
terrine in a baking pan and add enough hot water to reach 2/3 the way
up the side of the terrine. Bake, covered with a buttered sheet of
wax paper and the lid or a double layer of foil, in a preheated 375f
oven for 45 minutes. Remove terrine from pan, remove lid and paper,
and let cool for at least 30 minutes. Cut into 6 slices and arrange
slices in a buttered gratin dish just large enought to hold them in
one layer. Spread some of the remaining butter lightly over each
slice and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in a preheated 400f
oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are hot and puffed slightly. In
a saucepan, combine the tomato coulis and the remaining creme
fraiche. Heat the sauce over moderate heat, stirring, until it is
heated through. Serve alongside the terrine in a boat/ a 1978 Gourmet
