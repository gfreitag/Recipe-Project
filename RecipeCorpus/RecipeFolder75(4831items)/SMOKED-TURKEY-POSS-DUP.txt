Title: SMOKED TURKEY POSS DUP
Categories: Cajun, Smoker, Turkey
Yield: 12 Servings
12 lb Turkey
MMMMM--------------------WATER PAN SEASONINGS-------------------------
1 c  Wine white, dry
1    Onion, whole
1    Garlic clove, whole
1 tb Liquid Smoke
1 ts Mint, dried; crushed
2 tb Parsley; chopped
6 dr Peychaud's bitters
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
Prepare smoker.  While briquets are starting to burn, sprinkle
carcass and cavity with salt and cayenne pepper. I put a whole onion
inside the cavity, but you can make a stuffing if you like. Be
careful not to use ingredients in the stuffing that will spoil too
quickly.

I put a pork roast on the top rack of my smoker and a turkey on the
bottom rack.  Then I fill the water pan plumb up and let it cook
while I sleep at night.
