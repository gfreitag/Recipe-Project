Categories: Other meat
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ts Salt
1 lb Ground lamb -- very lean
2 tb Black peppercorns --
Cracked
2 c  Water
1    Bulb
1    Tomato
1/2 c  Fresh basil, mint or
Parsley
1 tb Butter -- cut into 4 pieces

1. Mix salt with lamb, shape meat into 4 patties, and coat both sides
of patties with peppercorns, pushing peppercorns into meat with the
heel of the hand. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.

2. Meanwhile bring the water to a boil. Drop garlic cloves into
boiling water; lower heat and simmer until garlic is very tender and
mild (about 25 minutes). Drain garlic and peel, reserving water.

3. Heat a heavy, nonreactive or nonstick medium skillet until waves
of heat ripple up. Sear lamb patties in dry skillet for 2 minutes per
side. Transfer to warmed platter. Peel, deseed and mince the tomato.
Add to skillet poached garlic, 1/4 cup water from the garlic, tomato,
and basil. Reduce sauce rapidly to a glaze, stirring constantly. With
pan off heat, whisk butter into warm sauce a piece at a time. Season
with salt to taste and pour sauce over lamb.
