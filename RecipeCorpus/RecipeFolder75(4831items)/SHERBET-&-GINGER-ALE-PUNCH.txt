Title: SHERBET & GINGER ALE PUNCH
Categories: Drinks, Party
Yield: 16 Cups
1/2 ga Sherbet (use your
-favorite flavor or one
-that complements the
-occasion)
2 qt Ginger ale
Scoop sherbet into punch bowl.  Slowly pour ginger ale over the
sherbet. Serve.  Replenish sherbet and/or ginger ale as needed.

NOTES:

*  A non-alcoholic party punch recipe -- This is a super non-alcoholic
punch with lots of possible variations.

*  Different sherbet flavors or mixtures of flavors make for many
variations. I once made a variation that replaced 1/2 of the ginger
ale with lemonade. Super!
