Title: SHERRIED BLACK BEANS WITH SAFFRON RICE
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Dried black beans
1/2 c  Finely diced salt pork
1 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Chopped poblano chiles
2    Cloves garlic,, minced
2 ts Sea salt
4 tb Dry fino sherry
Freshly ground black
-pepper,, to taste
Clean the beans, removing all stones or chaff. Rinse them well. In a
pot large enough to hold the beans plus water to cover, let them soak,
overnight.

In a mediumsize saucepan, over medium heat, saute the salt pork just
until it begins to brown. Add the onions and chiles and continue to
cook until soft, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to
cook, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Drain the beans and add fresh water to cover them. Add the contents
of the saucepan to the pot of beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce the
heat. Simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Add the salt and simmer,
uncovered, for about 30 minutes, or until tender. Watch the beans
carefully, and stir once or twice to be sure they do not stick to the
bottom of the pan.

Remove 1 cup of the beans, place them in a blender, and blend until
smooth. Stir them back into the pot along with the sherry. Add
freshly ground black pepper, and serve with Saffron Rice.
