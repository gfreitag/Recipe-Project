Categories: Russian, Salads, Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Whole chicken breasts
Salt
1/4 c  Light vegetable oil
2 c  Chopped Vidalia onions
3/4 c  Walnuts, lightly toasted
1/4 c  Finely chopped scallions
3/4 c  Finely chopped cilantro
1 1/3 c  Homemade mayonnaise
You may use commercial mayo
Fresh ground black peppe
Place the chicken breasts in a saucepan with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, add 1/2 teaspoon salt, reduce the heat, and simmer
until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Drain the
chicken and allow to cool. Remove and discard the skin. Remove the
chicken from the bones and tear the meat into shreds. Place in a
salad bowl and set aside. Heat the oil in a medium-size skillet over
medium-high heat. Saute the onions, stirring, until deep golden
brown, about 20 minutes. Drain the onions and add them to the
chicken. Cool to room temperature. Add the walnuts, scallions, and
cilantro to the chicken. Toss with the mayonnaise and season with
salt and pepper. Serve the salad at room temperature.
