1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Chopped parsley
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2    Garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 c  Unsalted hazel nuts or
-almonds
1 c  Juice from unripened grapes
-(about 1 large bunch)
1/4 c  Chicken broth (optional)
Chef Marco Fiorini's family roots are in the Valtellina, one of the
rugged, narrow Alpine valleys northeast of Milan. Fiorini remembers
the old people there making this sauce, which dates back at least to
the Middle Ages. The juice of unripened grapes is used in place of
vinegar, which gives the sauce a hauntingly tart taste. Where to find
unripened grapes? In a neighbor or friends backyard arbor, or ask a
farmer's market grape vendor to bring you some not-yet-ripe grapes.

Put bread crumbs, sugar, parsley, salt, pepper, garlic and nuts into a
blender or food processor and puree, as if making pesto sauce.

Slowly add the grape juice. At this point the mixture may be heated
in the chicken broth and served as a warm sauce. Be care- ful not to
let the sauce boil, or it will separate.

Makes 1 1/2 cups.

Uses: Serve warm as a sauce for fish, veal or chicken. Or omit the
chicken broth and serve at room temperature or on crackers or bread,
or as a dip for raw vegetables.
