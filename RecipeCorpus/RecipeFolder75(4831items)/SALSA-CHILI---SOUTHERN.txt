Categories: Ethnic, Chili, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Pork, cubed
1 1/2 lb Beef, cubed
1 1/2 lb Veal, cubed or use
4 1/2 lb Ground beef
4 1/2 lb Prepaerd salsa
48 oz Stewed tomatoes
3/4 c  Chili powder
3 ts Chopped garlic
1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
1 1/2 ts Ground oregano
1 1/2 c  Stock, chicken, beef, beer
3/8 c  Dried onions
Cut all of the meat into small pieces. In a cast iron pan or dutch
oven, brown the meat. Pork, beef and then the veal. After the meat is
browned set aside to drain then add to the pot. Pour off all of the
oil in the pan and add some water. Bring the water to a boil. Scrape
the bottom and add this to the chili pot. Cover the pot and let
simmer for three or more hours, stirring occasionally. This kind of
chili is better the next day. This can be cooked in a crockpot for 8
to 10 hours, on low. When served put some cheese on top. Garlic bread
is very good with this chili.
