"This is a sweet version of the meaty triangles popular in the Gulf
States during the holy month of Ramadan."

1. Combine the filling ingredients (saffron, rosewater, almonds, 1/3 c
sugar, and cardamom).

2. Preheat the oven to 375'F. Grease 1 or 2 baking sheets.

3. Cut the defrosted filo strips 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide, stacking and
covering with a slightly dampened towel to prevent drying. Lay 3 to 4
strips on your work surface and brush lightly with melted butter.
Layer a second strip on top of each.

4. Place a tablespoon of the filling toward the bottom right-hand
corner of each strip. Fold that corner diagonally over to the top
left-hand corner, forming a triangle. As you fold, be certain that
the side of the strip lines up perfectly with the folded portion.
Then fold straight up. Continue as if folding a flag, alternately
folding the bottom corners in a diagonal pattern and up. Place on the
baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.

5. Brush the tops of the pastries lightly with a bit of egg and
sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown.

Tunisia variation: Substitute grated orange peel for the saffron and
cardamom, and drizzle with sweet syrup after baking.

Lebanon variation: Substitute walnuts for the almonds, cinnamon and
nutmeg for the saffron and cardamom.
