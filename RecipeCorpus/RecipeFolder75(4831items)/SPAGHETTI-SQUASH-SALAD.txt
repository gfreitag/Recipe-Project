Categories: Diabetic, Salads, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 - 6 folks
3 lb Spaghetti squash;(about)
1/4 c  Parsley; chopped
1/4 c  Olive oil;
2 tb Margarine;
2 ts Fresh garlic; minced
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms; sliced
3 tb Butter or Margarine;
1/4 c  Grated parmesan cheese;
Salt to taste;
Freshly ground pepper;
With a knife, pierce the skin of squash in serveral places to allow
steam to escape while cooking.  Place whole squash in microwave oven
and cook on high for 15 minutes, turning once or twice. Remove from
oven or steamer and let stand 10 minutes. ( a steamer will do nicely
on top of the stove, too). Or, cut in half lengthwise, remove seeds
and place cut side down in pot with 2" of water.  Cover and boil 20
minutes. In a small bowl, place parsley, olive oil, margarine and
garlic. Cook on high for 1 minute ( or heat in pan on medium heat on
your stove.) Set aside. Saute mushrooms in 3 tablespoons butter or
margarine. Cut squash in half leghthwise and remove seeds and
membrame. With fork, gently pull spaghetti-like flesh away from side
of outer skin. Combine squash with mushrooms. Pour butter mixture
over vegetables and sprinkle with cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir and
serve. NOTE:  In (y)ield hot key the (y) and you can reflect the
amount for a serving for 1 serving....which would make this ABOUT:
Food Exchange per serving...1 VEGETABLES EXCHANGE + 1 FAT EXCHANGE
(if you cut down on the margarine, which I sure would!! And depend on
how many nice folks you have gracing your table)
