Title: SALMON-ASPARAGUS MANICOTTI
Categories: Cheese, Fish and se, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
16 oz Pkg Manicotti - (mine had 14
-tubes)
1 lb Farmer Cheese -- (or ricotta
Cheese)
1    Salmon Steak -- about 1/2 lb
1/2 lb Fresh Asparagus
1 cn Cream Of Asparagus Soup
Milk
Salt And Pepper
Parmesan Cheese
Cook the manicotti according to package directions, drain and cool.
Set aside.

Poach the salmon steak (in broth or whatever), let cool, remove skin
and bones, and crumble the flesh into medium-small pieces. Trim the
bottoms of the asparagus and chop the green parts into 1/2"-1"
pieces. You don't have to cook them beforehand.

Combine the cheese, salmon flakes, asparagus and salt and pepper to
taste in a large bowl. Combine cream of asparagus soup with 1 can of
milk and add some of the resulting prepared soup to the cheese
mixture. The stuffing should be soft but not runny. Use this to stuff
each tube of manicotti. Place them side-by-side in a shallow baking
dish. Pour the rest of the soup over the pan and sprinkle Parmesan
cheese on top. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes or so. Serve with, what
else, more steamed asparagus!! YUM! (Asparagus was on sale for
$1.29/# at Giant last week so I got a bunch. It was the pencil-thin
kind, too, not those big woody things we'll be getting later on.
Spring is on its way!
