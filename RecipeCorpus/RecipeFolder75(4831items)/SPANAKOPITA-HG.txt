Title: SPANAKOPITA-HG
Categories: Main dish, Cheese/eggs, Greek
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Fresh Spinach
7    Eggs
1/2 lb Feta cheese, crumbled
1 1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
Oil
1    Onion, chopped
Black pepper, freshly ground
8    Sheets of filo pastry
7 tb Butter
Wash the spinach well, chop it coarsely and put it into a large pan.
Cover the pan and cook the spinach over low heat for 7-8 minutes or
until it is wilted. Drain well in a colander, pressing out the
moisture with a wooden spoon. Beat the eggs until fluffy and add the
feta and cheddar.

Heat a little oil in a pan and saute the onion until it is golden.
Add the spinach, egg-cheese mixture, pepper and a little oregano.

Preheat the oven to 375F. Melt the butter and brush a baking dish
with it. Lay a sheet of file pastry on top and brush it with butter.
Top with another 4 sheets, brushing each with melted butter and
turning each sheet slightly so that the corners fan out, rather than
stacking them on top of each other. Reserve 3 sheets.

Pour in the spinach mixture and fold the pastry ends over it. Butter
the reserved sheets of filo and place them on top to cover the dish.
Slash the pastry in a few places with a sharp knife to allow the
steam to escape. Brush the top with more melted butter and bake for
45 minutes.
