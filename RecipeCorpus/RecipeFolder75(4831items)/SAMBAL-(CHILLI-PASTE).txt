Sambal is to Indonesian cuisine what salsa is to Mexican cooking: a
fiery hot condiment serves at every meal.

In a blender or food processor, combine chilies, garlic, onion, sugar,
lemon juice, water, and salt; whirl until onions are finely minced.
Pour mixture into 1 to 2 quart pan and cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until reduced to about 1/2 cup (about 10 minutes).
Serve at room temperature.  Makes about 1/2 cup.
