1 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 lb Bay scallops; or large
-sea scallops, halve
4 tb Pine nuts
1 tb Shallots; mince fine
1 ts Garlic; mince fine
1/2 c  Dry white wine

IF THE DRIED TOMATOES are packed in oil, drain and pat them dry on a
towel. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil
is almost smoking, toss in the scallops and cook for 30 seconds
without stirring. Stir with a wooden spoon and let cook another
minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove the scallops to a plate. They
should be only partially cooked. Discard the fat from the skillet.
Return the skillet to high heat, add the shallots, garlic, wine,
lemon juice and dried tomatoes. Boil, reducing wine by half.
Meanwhile, the scallops will have released a certain amount of
liquid. Pour this into the pan and reduce until thick. Return the
scallops and add the pine nuts to the pan, reduce the heat to low,
whisk in the butter and add the chopped parsley, salt and pepper.
Pour onto a serving platter. Source: Trump's Restaurant, Los Angeles
