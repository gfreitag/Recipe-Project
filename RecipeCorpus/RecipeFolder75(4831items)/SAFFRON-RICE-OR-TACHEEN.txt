Categories: Rice
Yield: 8 Servings
2 1/2 c  Basmati rice
1/2 ts Saffron (either
Powdered or threads-
Let soak in 1 T. hot
Water for a few minutes)
3    Eggs
1 c  Plain yogurt
1/3 c  Oil
rinse rice several times.  Cook rice in rice cooker or put rice in
medium sauce pan along with 2 1/2 cups of water. Bring to a boil,
then simmer with the pan covered about 15-20 minutes or until the
rice is firm, but not mushy.  Pour out any remaining water (if any)
and set aside. Beat the eggs, yogurt, saffron water, and oil
together. It should look like a creamy yellow sauce. Add rice and
stir until all rice is coated withsauce.. Turn into a 2 quart greased
pyrex bowl or a 9x9 glass baking dish. Bake at 400 degrees (F)for 40
minutes. Let cool about 10 minutes. Loosen sides and invert onto
serving dish.  The outside will be a nice brown. garnish with green
and red grapes, or chicken or lettuce or anything else you might wish.

note: the original recipe called for diced chicken stirred into the
mix, but that didn't work well for us. One boy wouldn't eat chicken
for 5 years after that. But he loves the rice!
