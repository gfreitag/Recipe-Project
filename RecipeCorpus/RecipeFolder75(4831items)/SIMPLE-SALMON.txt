Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
4    Green onions, whole
1    Salmon steak or fillet
-Salt and pepper to taste
-Fresh or dried dill
-(optional)
1    Lemon wedge
Crusty, crisp, delicious and quite a different taste than other
salmon, dishes.

Pour oil into medium-size heavy frying pan over medium heat. Wash and
trim onions and add to pan. Season salmon with salt and pepper and
add to pan. Fry until crusty and cooked through (about 10 minutes
depending on thickness) but not overdone. Check for doneness by
inserting small knife in center; flesh will have changed from dark
pink to pale pink. (Onions will have brownedQand will taste
marvelous.) Sprinkle with dill, if used. Transfer to plate, serve
with lemon wedge.

Makes one serving.
