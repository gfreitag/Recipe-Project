Title: SAUCE HOLLANDAISE
Categories: Sauces, Preserves
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Butter
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Lemon Juice
Cayenne
3    Egg Yolks
Boiling Water
Slowly melt the butter and keep it warming. Barely heat the lemon
juice (you may substitute dry sherry or tarragon vinegar). Keep a pot
of boiling water handy along with a tablespoon with which to measure
it. Place the egg yolks in the top of a double-boiler, OVER, NOT IN
THE boiling water. Beat the egg yolks using a wire whisk until they
begin to thicken. Add 1 Tablespoon of boiling water per cup of
finished sauce. Beat again until the eggs again begin to thicken.
Repeat this process until you have added three more tablespoons of
boiling water per finished cup of sauce. Now beat in the lemon juice
and remove the double-boiler from the heat. Beat the sauce well with
a wire whisk. Continue to beat while slowly adding the butter, salt
and a few grains of cayenne. Beat until sauce is thick. Serve at once.
