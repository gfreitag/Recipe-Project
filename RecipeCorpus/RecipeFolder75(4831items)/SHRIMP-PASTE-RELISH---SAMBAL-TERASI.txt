Stephen Ceideburg
5    Green chillis
1    Shallot
1 sl Terasi, grilled
1    Clove garlic
1 ts Brown sugar (optional)
Salt
1/2 sm Lime, juice only
Unlike some other kinds of sambal, this one doesn't keep, so make it
in small quantities-just enough for one meal. It is very hot.

Boil the chillis for 6 minutes, seed them, and cut them up small. Then
pound them together with the shallot, garlic, and grilled terasi.
Season with salt, sugar if desired, and lime juice.
