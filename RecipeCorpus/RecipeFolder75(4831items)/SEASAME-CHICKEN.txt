Categories: Main dish, Oriental, Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
Whole steamed chicken
-see below
2 ts Sesame oil
1 tb Minced ginger
2 ts Light soy sauce
1 tb Teriyaki sauce
1/2 ts Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1/2 c  Toasted sesame seeds
1/2 c  Finely shredded green onions
Any large pot that will hold a  deep sided plate such as a pie tin
will work. Put a few inches of  water in the pot and then put an
inverted dish or wide can with the ends removed in the water and then
place the plate on the  support. Anything that will hold the plate
above the water and let the steam circulate will work. Bring the
water to a boil and put the chicken in the pot. Cover tightly and let
steam for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the bird
and how well done you want it. Turn off the heat, remove the lid and
let the steam disperse. Remove the chicken and let it cool until you
can handle it comfortably. While the chicken steams, heat the oil
quite hot and then let it cool. Rub or brush the oil over the chicken
and then the salt. At this point, you can bone and shred the chicken,
cut it into Chinese style serving pieces or just disjoint it western
style. Place on a bed of greens --lettuce or whatever you like. Heat
the sesame oil in a small  pan and brown the ginger. Add soy sauce,
teriyaki sauce and sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Pour sauce
over the chicken and serve warm or at room temperature.
