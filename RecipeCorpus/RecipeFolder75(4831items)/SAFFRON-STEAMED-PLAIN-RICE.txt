cooker.

4. Allow to cool for 10 minutes without uncovering the pot.

5. Remove lid and place a round serving dish over the pot. Hold the
dish and the pot tightly together and turn them over to unmold rice.

detail --- These cooking times are for the National Deluxe rice
cooker. The cooking time for rice may vary according to different
brands of rice cookers. It is desirable but not essential to soak the
rice in 8 cups water with 2 tablespoons salt for 2 to 24 hours. This
is especially good for older basmati-type rice. For AMERICAN
long-grain rice, use only 3 cups of water and wash the rice once.
Among other long-grain types of rice, choose those that are long,
thick, and sleek at the tip. Copyright (c) 1994 by Najmieh Khalili
