Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems.  Chop coarsely and
put into a large pan.  Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes
shaking pan now and then or turning spinach with a fork. Heat just
long enough to wilt spinach so that juices can run out freely.  Drain
well in colander, pressing occasionally with a spoon.

Gently fry onion in olive oil for 10 minutes, add chopped leek and
spring onions and fry gently for further 5 minutes until transparent.

Place well-drained spinach in a mixing bowl and add oil and onion
mixture, herbs and nutmeg.  Blend thoroughly, adding salt and pepper
to taste.

Place a sheet of fillo pastry on work surface and brush lightly with
olive oil.  Top with 3 more sheets of pasry, brushing each with oil.

Brush top layer lightly with oil and place half the spinach mixture
along the length of the pastry towards one edge and leaving 4 cm
(1-1/2 inches) clear on each side.

Fold bottom edge of pastry over filling, roll once, fold in sides
then roll up.  Place a hand at each end of roll and push it in gently
like a concertina. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling. Place
rolls in an oiled baking dish leaving space between rolls. Brush tops
lightly with oil and bake in a moderate oven for 30 minutes until
golden. Serve hot cut in portions.
