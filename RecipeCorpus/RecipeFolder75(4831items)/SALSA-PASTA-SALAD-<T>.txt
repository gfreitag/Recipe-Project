Title: SALSA PASTA SALAD <T>
Categories: Digest, July
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Large shell pasta, cooked
1    Basket (pint?) cherry
Tomatoes, halved
1    To 2 C fresh corn kernels
(or frozen and thawed)
1    Sweet pepper (color of your
Choice), chopped
1    8oz can mild, chopped green
Chilis
1    16oz can kidney beans or
Equivalant amount cooked
1 sm Red onion, chopped
1    Jar (~16oz?) of your
Favorite salsa
Combine all ingrediants well and refrigerate at least several hours.
The pasta will soak up the salsa, so you may need to add more just
before serving if you like a "wetter" pasta salad.
