MARINADE: Combine brown sugar, curry powder, peanut butter, soy
sauce, lime juice, garlic and crushed chiles to taste in a shallow
dish. Thread the meat pieces on water soaked bamboo skewers, weaving
skewers in and out of meat lengthwise to create a serpentine design.
Place the skewers in the soy sauce mixture. Marinate at room
temperature for at least 2 hours or in the refrigerator as long as
overnight for a more intense flavor. PEANUT SAUCE: Combine peanut
butter, coconut milk, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger,
garlic and cayenne pepper to taste in a sauce pan over moderate heat
and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is as thick as heavy
cream, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a food processor or blender and
puree briefly. Add chicken stock and cream; blend until smooth.
Reserve. (This mixture may be made several hours ahead and
refrigerated. Return to room temperature before serving.) Prepare a
moderate charcoal fire in an open grill or preheat the broiler. Cook
the skewered meat, turning several times and basting with the
marinade, over medium-hot coals (or under a broiler) until crispy on
the outside but still moist inside, about 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle
with lime zest and garnish with cilantro leaves. Serve with the
peanut sauce for dipping. Makes about 18 skewers; allow 2 per serving
as an appetizer, 4 or more as a main coarse. For a main dish, serve
with steamed rice, salad and grilled or steamed asparagus or other
vegetable.
