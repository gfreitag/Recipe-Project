Title: SPAGHETTI WITH GARLIC & OLIVE OIL
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
12    Garlic cloves -- thinly
Sliced
1/2 ts Red chile flakes
1/2 ts Salt
1/2    Lemon
1 bn Italian parsley -- chopped
1 lb Spaghetti
Garlicky Breadcrumbs
Heat the olive oil gently with the garlic in a small skillet. When the
garlic turns opaque, add the red chile pepper flakes, and the salt.
Squeeze the lemon into the hot oil. Turn off the heat and let the
garlic turn light golden at the edges. The garlic will continue to
cook in the hot oil. When the oil has cooled somewhat, add the
parsley.

Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in abundant boiling salted water until
al dente. Drain the pasta well in a colander and place in a shallow
serving dish. Pour the warm olive oil with the garlic, chile and
parsley over the pasta. If desired, drizzle more extra-virgin olive
oil on top. Top with a handful of Garlicky Breadcrumbs.

Drizzle a little olive oil in a pan along with minced garlic. Toss to
coat while adding bread crumbs, salt and pepper.
