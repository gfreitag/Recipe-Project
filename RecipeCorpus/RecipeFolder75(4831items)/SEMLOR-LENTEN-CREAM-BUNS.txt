Title: SEMLOR-LENTEN CREAM BUNS
Categories: Desserts, Swedish
Yield: 12 Servings
1/8 lb Butter or margarine
1 c  Milk
1 oz Yeast
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Ground cardamom
3 c  Baking flour
1    Lightly beaten egg
Filling
The scooped-out portion of
Bread from the buns
2 1/2 oz Almond paste
1/4 c  Cream or milk
Garnish
1 c  Whipping cream
Powdered sugar
To make the buns: crumble the yeast in a bowl.  Melt the butter or
margarine in a saucepan, add the milk, heat until lukeward (not over
100 degrees).  Remove from heat and stir in the yeast until it is
completely absorbed.  Gradually stir in the salt, sugar, one egg,
cardamom, and most of the flour.  Work the dough until smooth and
shiny, then cover and let rise 30-40 minutes. On a floured surface
knead the remaining flour into the dough.  Divide into 12 parts and
hand roll into smooth round balls. Let rise 20-30 minutes on a
greased cookie sheet. Set oven for 475 degrees. Brush with the beaten
egg and bake in the middle of the oven 8-10 minutes until golden and
baked through. Set them out to cool.

To make the filling: cut off the top of each bun and scoop out a
hollow in the bottom half with a spoon. Mix the scooped-out bits with
the almond paste.  Add cream to thin the mixture to a soft, smooth
consistency. Fill the buns with the almond-paste mixture and put the
tops back on. Using stiff whipped cream in a pastry bag, squeeze out
a wreath of whipped cream around the top of each bun, then sprinkle
with powdered sugar and serve.
