Cut the eggplants in half and score the flesh. Brush the cut sides
with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, place on a hot grill or under the
broiler, and cook until browned and soft, about 10 minutes. Scoop out
the flesh and coarsely chop it. Set aside. Heat the remaining olive
oil in a large, heavy pot. Add the onions and garlic, and saute over
medium heat until golden, 7 or 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook
just until they begin to wilt and release their juices, about 5
minutes. Add the eggplant flesh and the chicken stock and bring to
the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook 10 minutes. Add the
basil and oregano and cook 2 minutes more. Strain the solids from the
liquid, reserving the hot liquid in the pot. Puree the solids in a
food processor or blender until smooth and creamy. Return the puree
to the pot and reheat to just below simmer. Season to taste with
salt, pepper, and Tabasco and garnish with Parmesan cheese. Yield:
4-6 servings
