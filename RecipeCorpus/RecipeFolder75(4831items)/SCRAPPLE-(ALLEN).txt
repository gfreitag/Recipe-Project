Here's a Pennsylvania Dutch version of scrapple. You'll probably have
better luck rounding up pork scraps than a pig's head, although you
could probably pick one up at an Asian or Latino market.

Parboil pork scraps or head, in water to cover, for 10 minutes. Drain;
discard water. return to pot with fresh water to cover, salt,
peppercorns, cloves and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer
for 3 hours, or until meat falls off the bones easily. Strain stock;
reserve. Remove all meat from bones and chop; set aside.

Reheat stock; gradually add cornmeal, stirring constantly until thick,
about 15 minutes.  Add meat, onion, cayenne, nutmeg and sage; adjust
seasonings with salt and pepper. Pour into 2 greased loaf pans.
Refrigerate until set.  Slice and fry for breakfast. Will keep in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Serves 12.
