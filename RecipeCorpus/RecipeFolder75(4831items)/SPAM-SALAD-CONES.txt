Categories: Salads
Yield: 5 Servings
1 cn SPAM Luncheon Meat, cubed
-(12 oz)
1 c  Chopped celery
1/2 c  Chopped green bell pepper
1/3 c  Mayonnaise or salad dressing
1/4 c  Toasted slivered almonds
2 tb Chopped onion
2 tb Pickle relish
1 ts Prepared mustard
5    Flour tortillas (8")
5    Lettuce leaves
In medium bowl, mix all ingredients except tortillas and lettuce.
Cover; refrigerate until ready to serve. Roll each tortilla into a
large cone and secure with wooden picks. Carefully stuff each cone
with a crumpled piece of foil so cone will retain shape. Place cones
on baking sheet. Broil, 3" from heat, turning several times until
cones are crisp and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Cool; carefully
remove foil and wooden picks. When ready to serve, line each cone
with a lettuce leaf and fill with salad mixture.
