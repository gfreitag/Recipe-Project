Sauerkraut Cake

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease and flour two 8" or one
9 x 13" pan.

Cream sugar and butter; beat eggs and vanilla together and add to
creamed mixture.  sift dry ingredients together and add alternately
with water to creamed mixture. rinse sauerkraut, drain and chop. Stir
into batter. Pour into pan(s) and bake 30-40 minutes.

Ice with desired icing and fill with Mocha whipped cream.

Now, where's the Mocha Whipped Cream?  Checking the index. Whoops,
sorry, they didn't put that one in!

I'll bet a little powdered instant coffee, cocoa and sugar beaten
into some whipped cream would do the trick.

I'm looking forward to those recipes you get from your mom! Sure hope
you're planning on sharing them here. <grin> The typing practice will
do you good. Help you when you're ready to type up those term papers.
