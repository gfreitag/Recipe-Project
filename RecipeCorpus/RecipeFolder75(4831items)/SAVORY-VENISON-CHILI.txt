I like to start off this chili with bacon. Once it browns, use 2
tablespoons of the bacon fat to wilt the vegetables - then one more
tablespoon of the fat should be enough to brown the venison. Since
the meat is lean, brown it quickly over high heat.

1. Brown the bacon in a skillet over medium heat for about 10 minutes
or until golden brown. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set
aside. Reserve 3 tablespoons of bacon fat; discard the rest.

2. Place 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in a casserole; add the onion
and carrots, sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, marjoram and red
pepper flakes, then cook for 5 minutes. Add the reserved bacon.

3. Pour the remaining tablespoon of bacon fat back into the skillet.
Brown the venison over medium-high heat in small batches and remove
to the casserole with a slotted spoon. (The meat should brown
quickly, so raise the heat to high if necessary.)

4. Add the tomatoes, broth, wine and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer
and cook, uncovered, for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce
the heat if the chili begins to boil.

5. Add the kidney beans and lima beans, then adjust the seasonings.
Simmer 10 minutes longer or until meat is tender.

6. Serve the chili hot in 6 bowls (over rice or barley, if desired).
