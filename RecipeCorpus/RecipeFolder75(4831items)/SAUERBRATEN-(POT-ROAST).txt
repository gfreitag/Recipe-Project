Title: SAUERBRATEN (POT ROAST)
Categories: Penndutch, Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lb Beef **
1 pt Vinegar
1 x  Water
4 ea Bay leaf
12 ea Peppercorns, whole, black
4 ea Cloves, whole
1 ea Carrot, bunch
6 ea Onion
1 tb Sugar
12 ea Gingersnaps
1 x  Salt & pepper
** Use beef chuck, rump, or round. *** My notes: Watch meat while it
sits and add more vinegar and water (half of each) to keep meat
covered. A similar recipe in Bon Appetit used red vinegar and red
wine for the marinade and the beef was left in the refrigerator for
about 9 days. Wipe meat with damp cloth and then sprinkle thoroughly
with salt and pepper. Place meat in an earthen dish and add vinegar
and enough water to cover. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns and
cloves, and let stand tightly covered for 5 days in a cool place. Cut
carrots in strips; slice onions. Put meat in a dutch oven and brown
well on all sides. Add the carrots and onions and 1 cup of the spiced
vinegar. Cover tightly and cook over low flame about 3 hours or until
meat is tender. When meat is cooked, add the sugar and crumbled
ginger snaps and cook for 10 minutes. This makes delicious gravy. If
necessary, more of the spiced vinegar may be added. Source:
