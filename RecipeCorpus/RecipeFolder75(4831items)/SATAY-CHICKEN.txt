Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM----------------------------RUB---------------------------------
6    Cloves of garlic, minced
4 ts Ground coriander
4 ts Brown sugar,packed
1 tb Black pepper
2 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1/2 c  Soy sauce
4 ts Finely chopped ginger root

Rub:

Combine rub ingredients and rub into chicken pieces. Allow to stand
for 45 minutes.

Combine  marinade ingredients and add chicken pieces. Do this in a non
aluminum pan.  Store in the refigerator at least 6 hours, or
overnight.

Grill, being careful not to overcook.  Serve with peanut sauce. I do
this sometimes using boneless breast, which I cut either into chunks
or strips (threaded on skewers), and sometimes just using chicken
pieces. Enjoy!!!
