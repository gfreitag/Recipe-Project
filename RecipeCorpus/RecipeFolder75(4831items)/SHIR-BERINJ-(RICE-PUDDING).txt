Title: SHIR-BERINJ (RICE PUDDING)
Categories: Desserts, Afghan
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 lb Rice
1 pt Milk
4 oz Sugar
4 oz Sultanas
Rose water or vanilla

Wash the rice and spread it out on a flat board to dry. When
completely dry, crush to a third of the size of the grain. Boil the
milk and allow it to thicken, stirring constantly. When it is reduced
to three-quarters of the original quantity, add the rice and cook for
a few minutes. Add sugar and sultanas, and cook until you have a
thick custard (10 to 15 minutes). Remove from heat and flavor to
taste with rose water or vanilla. Sprinkle with pistachio nuts. Serve
hot or cold.
