Here is the second chicken recipe from a really comprehensive and
beautiful cookbook, THE COMPLETE ASIAN COOKBOOK by Charmaine Solomon.

"Red cooking" is the term applied to cooking in dark soy sauce. The
liquid that remains after cooking is called a "master sauce", and can
be frozen or refrigerated for future use.  It should be used to cook
meat or poultry at least once a week to keep it "alive." Cook chicken
drumsticks this way for taking on picnics or serving at buffet
parties. Fragrant with ginger and anise, red-cooked chicken will
surely become one of your favorites.

Serves: 8 to 10 as part of a large menu, 4-5 as a main meal with rice

Wash chicken well.  Choose a saucepan into which chicken will just
fit so that the soy liquid covers as much of the bird as possible.
Put chicken into saucepan, breast down, then add all the ingredients
except sesame oil. Bring slowly to the boil, then reduce heat, cover
and simmer very gently for 15 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken
over, replace lid and simmer 20 minutes, basting breast with liquid
every 5 minutes.

Remove from heat and leave covered in the saucepan until cool. Lift
chicken out of sauce, put on a serving platter and brush with sesame
oil. This gives the chicken a glistening appearance as well as some
extra flavor.

Traditionally the chicken is put on a chopping board and cut in two
lengthways with a sharp cleaver.  Each half is chopped into 1 1/2 inch
strips and reassembled in the original shape. If this proves too much
of an undertaking, simply carve the chicken into joints. Serve at room
temperature with some of the cooking liquid as a dipping sauce.
