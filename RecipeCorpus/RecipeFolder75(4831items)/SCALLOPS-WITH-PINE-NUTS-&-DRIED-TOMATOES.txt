Title: SCALLOPS WITH PINE NUTS & DRIED TOMATOES
Categories: Seafood - e, Pastas and
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Canola oil
1 1/2 lb Sea scallops -- halved
4 tb Pine nuts
1 tb Shallots -- minced
1 ts Garlic -- minced
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/2 c  Dried tomatoes
6 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Parsley -- chopped
Salt and pepper -- to taste
8 oz Pasta -- cooked
If the dried tomatoes are packed in oil, drain and pat them dry on a
towel.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.  When the oil is
almost smoking, toss in the scallops and cook for 30 seconds without
stirring. Stir with a wooden spoon and let cook another minute. Using
a slotted spoon, remove the scallops to a plate.  They should be only
partially cooked.

Discard the fat from the skillet.  Return the skillet to high heat,
add the shallots, garlic, wine, lemon juice and dried tomatoes. Boil,
reducing wine by half.

Meanwhile, the scallops will have released a certain amount of
liquid. Pour this into the pan and reduce until thick.

Return the scallops and add the pine nuts to the pan, reduce the heat
to low, whisk in the butter and add the chopped parsley, salt and
pepper.

Serve the scallops with the sauce spooned over them.

Serve over cooked pasta.
