Title: SCONES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
1 c  Milk
1/8 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 tb Shortening
1/2 c  Currants
Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in shortening with
fingers. Add currants and soda to mix and stir into flour mixture
with a fork. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead slightly and pat or
roll into 1/2" thickness. Cut into triangles or circles. Bake these
on an ungreased griddle over medium heat. As one side becomes brown,
turn and brown the other side, then turn each scone slightly on edge
and place on side of griddle to the "fire". Turn until all edges are
slightly browned. The firing will cook the scones through from all
sides so there will be no raw dough in the center. Split and serve
with butter, or fill with such as ham or cream cheese.
