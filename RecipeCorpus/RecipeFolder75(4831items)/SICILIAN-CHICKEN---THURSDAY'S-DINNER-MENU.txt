couscous, you can enjoy chocolate cake, too, without blowing the bank
as far as fat in concerned.

ingredients, including capers and tomatoes.

Combine basil, oregano, salt and pepper; sprinkle half of the mixture
over both sides of chicken.

In a large nonstick skillet, heat half of the oil over medium-high
heat; brown chicken on all sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer to plate
and set aside.

in skillet, heat remaining oil over medium heat; cook onion, garlic
and remaining basil mixture, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until
softened.

Add tomatoes, breaking up with spoon, cinnamon, vinegar and capers;
bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until
chicken is no longer pink inside.

Sprinkle with parsley.
