If you decide to make only one sauce, this is generally the most
popular says Julie Kataoka. From the "Japanese Country Cookbook, by
Russ Rudsinski.

Grind sesame seeds using a mortar and pestle or a small blender.
Combine with soy sauce, oil, vinegar and water. Place garlic,
togarashi and onion on a separate plate for diners to add as they
wish. Place sauce in small individual dishes for each diner.

Note: Togarashi is a Japanese seasoning made of crushed red pepper and
other condiments, blended into a powder. Red or black pepper may be
substituted.
