Categories: Soups, Appetizers, Vegetarian, Mark's
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
2 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
1 ea Jalapeno chile, finely
-- chopped
1/2 ts Cumin powder
1/2 ts Hungarian paprika
1 md Tomato, finely chopped
4 oz Pearl barley
3 c  Stock
2 c  Cabbage, shredded
1 c  Green peas, fresh or frozen
1 c  Green beans, fresh or frozen
Salt & pepper
Heat oil in a large soup pot.  When hot, put in the garlic & stir
quickly. Add the jalapeno, quickly followed by the cumin & paprika.
Cook for a few moments, stirring enough to prevent it sticking.  Add
the tomatoes & barley & quickly stir.  Let cook very gently until the
tomatoes begin to break down.  Stir occasionally. Add the stock,
bring to a boil & then reduce to a simmer.  Simmer, covered for about
10    minutes.

Add the peas, beans & cabbage.  Raise heat to return the soup to a
boil & then lower heat again & continue to simmer until the barley is
cooked & tender.  Season with salt & lots of black pepper. Add a
little more stock if necessary.  Cook for a few moments longer & then
serve.

NOTE: This soup may benefit from a splash of lemon or lime juice. You
could sprinkle over some parsley or cilantro as well.
