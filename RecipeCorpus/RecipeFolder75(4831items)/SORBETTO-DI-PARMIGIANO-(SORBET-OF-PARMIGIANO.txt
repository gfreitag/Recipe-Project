Title: SORBETTO DI PARMIGIANO (SORBET OF PARMIGIANO
Categories: Ice cream, Italian
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly /
- finely grated
3 c  Skim milk
3    Egg yolks
1 pn Salt
1 pt Heavy cream
2 lb Rock salt
"Sorbetti became very popular in the eighteenth century, and the
category included many non-sweet dishes. There is a famous treatise
on sorbetti by a physician of the time, telling of the many
therapeutic uses for these iced dishes. This one, of Parmigiano, is
typical of the non-sweet examples, and perhaps the easiest to
understand for the modern palate. It should be eaten in place of the
cheese coarse, either instead of dessert or before it. The dish has
an established place in the old Parma cooking and is *not* an
experiment."

Soak the grated Parmesan in a small crockery bowl with
1    cup of the milk for 1 hour.

Heat the remaining milk in a flameproof casserole and, when the milk
reaches the boiling point, add the soaked Parmesan and the milk. Stir
with a wooden spoon to keep the cheese from sticking to the bottom of
the casserole. Simmer for 2 minutes.

Line a small strainer with a heavy cheesecloth or paper towels and
place it over a crockery bowl. Pour the contents of the casserole
through the cheesecloth and let stand for about 1 hour to drain
completely. Discard the gummy residue of the cheese remaining in the
strainer. (This residue will have lost the flavor of years of aging
and will resemble the bland fresh curd of Parmesan. The flavor, of
course, will have been absorbed by the milk.)

Be sure the liquid in the bowl has no cheese grains in it. Then
prepare a "custard cream" using this liquid and 3 egg yolks and salt,
following standard pastry cream directions.

Transfer the cream to a crockery bowl and let stand until completely
cool. Prepare the Sorbetto, following ice cream maker's directions.
