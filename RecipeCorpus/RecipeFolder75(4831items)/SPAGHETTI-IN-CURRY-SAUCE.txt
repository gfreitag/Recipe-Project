Wash and dice or slice all vegetables. Start pasta cooking with oil
to keep from sticking. Stir occasionally. Cook potatoes in small
amount of water, stirring occasionally. Saute onions, mushrooms,
peppers and garlic in small amount of oil; when lightly browned, add
1/4 cup of potato water. Add carrots and boil, stirring frequently.
When carrots are soft, remove from heat. Mix milk and flour in cup,
then add to vegetables. Drain and add potatoes when just soft. Add
spices and cook on medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Turn down the heat
and let simmer until the pasta is ready. The sauce will thicken as
long as it cooks. From Bruce & Jill's Favourite Family Recipes Serves
