1.  Prepare filling. Cream cheeses in food processor, transfer to
bowl and add remaining ingredients stirring gently. 2. Prepare Cream
Sauce: melt butter in saucepan and add garlic and onion stirring
gently till transparent. Add flour and stir to make a roux. Add
liquids and stir gently until it thickens.Add 1/2 bunch cilantro
chopped. I used no salt in this. 3. Tomatillo Sauce: peel skins from
tomatillos and wash them. Put in a cup of boiling water in saucepan
and cook until tender with onion. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Transfer to food processor with liquid and add liquid if needed. 4.
Put a dollop of filling on a flour tortilla and fold up into a little
package. I did not roll these but folded each long end in and then
the short ends and put in greased casserole seam side down. Continue
until all filling and tortillas are used. 5. Cover with cream sauce.
6. Top with tomatillo sauce. 7.. Sprinkle chopped red bell pepper or
pimiento on top of tomatillo sauce to decorate. 8. Bake at 350 until
bubbly and cheese is heated through These are to die for and as low
fat as I could make them. Emilie rwsm05a
