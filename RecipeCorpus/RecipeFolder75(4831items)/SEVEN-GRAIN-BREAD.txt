1/2 tb Bread flour

I bought a bag of "7-grain mix" (Stone-Burh) and came up with the
following recipe for the BM.  My goal was to come up with a "Poulsbo
Bread". This is very very close to the commercial product - only a
lot fresher tasting. About the only thing missing is sunflower seeds,
which I will try adding next time. I hope you like this. We ate an
entire loaf in one sitting (and there are only two of us!) Put
ingredients into pan in order listed. Bake at regular setting. One
more thing: this is a soft bread and will be difficult to slice when
hot. If you are going to use it in a sandwich, allow it to cool
first. Regards,   *** Gaye in Bellevue, WA *** 10/01 01:34 pm
