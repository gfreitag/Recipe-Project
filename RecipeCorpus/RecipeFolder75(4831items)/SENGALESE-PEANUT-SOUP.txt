Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
1 ts Cayenne pepper; or more to
-taste
2 tb Peanut or vegetable oil
2 tb Curry powder; such as
-garam masala
3 c  Chicken broth
10 md Tomatoes; cut in half
-crosswise, seeds squeezed
-out, and coarsely chopped
Or
5 c  Canned tomatoes, drained and
-seeded, and chopped
2/3 c  Smooth peanut butter*
Salt and pepper
Sour Cream
Lime wedges
*It's better to use old-fashioned peanut butter without stabilizers
to keep it from separating.

In a 4-quart pot over medium heat, cook the onion, garlic, and cayenne
pepper in the oil until the onion turns translucent, about 10
minutes. Stir in the curry powder and stir the mixture over medium
heat for 1 minute more.  Add the chicken broth and tomatoes, simmer
for 10 minutes more, and strain the soup through the fine disk of a
food mill or push it through a medium-mesh strainer with a ladle.

Bring the soup to a simmer and whisk in the peanut butter. Season
with salt and pepper and more cayenne if you want it hotter. Serve
sour cream and lime wedges at the table.

Suggestions and Variations: You can add a cup of coconut milk or heavy
cream to give this soup extra richness and a nice velvety texture. The
author adds a few tablespoons of chopped cilantro to it. If you want
to make this into a substantial main course, saute a cut-up chicken
in peanut oil, then simmer it in the soup for 15-20 minutes.
