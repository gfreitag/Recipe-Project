Title: SHAKING BEEF (BO LUC LAC)
Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Soy vinaigrette
2    White scallions -- cut up
1 1/2 lb Beef sirloin -- cubed
1 ts Ground black pepper
5    Cloves garlic -- minced
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
3 tb Soy sauce
2 lg Bunches watercress -- torn
2 tb Sugar
1 sm Red onion -- thinly sliced
1 1/2 tb Dry sherry
1.  Prepare the soy vinaigrette and set aside.

2.  In a large bowl, combine the beff with the garlic, soy sauce,
sugar, sherry, scallion, pepper, and 2 tb of the oil. Cover and
refrigerate 3 hours or overnight.

3.  When ready to serve, put the watercress and onion on a large
platter and toss with the vinaigrette.

4.  In a large skillet over high heat, add the remaining 2 tb of oil
and when smoking, add the beff mixture in an even layer. Let it sit
in the pan undisturbed, until it forms a brown crust on the bottom,
about 1 minute. Now, shake the pan to release the beff, using
chopsticks if needed. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, to desired
doneness, about 4 minutes for medium-rare.  Spoon the hot beef over
the watercress and serve.
