Long, long ago when events were recorded only on cavern walls by the
ancients who inhabited these halls, a legend was born. The legendary
spamonster of Townloch had shown itself only to select tribespeople,
and only on rare occasions. These urges to appear usually occured
around oestertide to celebrate the glory that is spring! How very
lucky we are to bear witness to such a fabulous event! To mark this
occasion a traditional feast has been prepared for your enjoyment
:)

PREPARATION: Combine all ingredients in a food processor. Use on and
off method until a fine paste is formed. Serve dip with your favorite
chips or fresh veggies. Enjoy!
