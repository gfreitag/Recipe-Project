Friends and relatives of Jean Roczniak of Rochester, Minnesota, are
delighted when they're invited on Mississippi River "cruising picnics"
aboard the Roczniak houseboat. Jean's simple, yet sophisticated,
make-ahead picnics add to the fun.  Fresh dill weed and lemon juice
lend a summer-light flavor to the creamy sauce for this chilled
salmon.

onion,
salt, peppercorns, and bay leaves.  Bring to boiling and add the
