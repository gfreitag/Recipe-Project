Categories: Soups, Middle east, Egypt, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Red lentils
2 qt Stock
1 md Onion, peeled & quartered
1 md Tomato, quartered
2 ts Garlic, coarsely chopped
4 tb Olive oil
1 tb Onion, finely chopped
2 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Salt
Black pepper, freshly ground
Lemon, cut into wedges
Wash the lentils in a large sieve or colander set under cold running
water until the draining water runs clear. In a heavy 4 to 5 qt pot,
bring the stock to a boil over high heat. Add the lentils, onion,
tomato and garlic, reduce the heat to low, and simmer partially
covered for 45 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Meanwhile,
in a small skillet, heat 1 tb of the oil over moderate heat. Add the
chopped onions and, stirring frequently, cook for 10 minutes, or
until they are soft and deeply browned. Set aside off the heat. Puree
the soup through a food mill or pour the entire contents of the pot
into a sieve set over a deep bowl and force the ingredients through
with the back of a large spoon, pressing down hard on the vegetables
before discarding the pulp. Return the soup to the pot and, stirring
constantly, cook over low heat for 3 or 4 minutes to heat through.
Stir in the cumin, salt and pepper, and taste for seasoning. Just
before serving, stir in the remaining 3 tbs of oil. To serve, ladle
the soup into a heated tureen, sprinkle lightly with the reserved
browned onions and serve the lemon wedges separately.
