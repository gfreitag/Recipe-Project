Time: 1:15 * To make tamarind liquid, pour 1/2 cup boiling water over
five or six fresh peeled tamarind pods, and let sit for 30 minutes.
Then pour through a strainer into a bowl, pressing as much of the
pulp through as possible. Shell the shrimp.  Cut them in half
lengthwise, toss them in corn- starch and sesame oil and refrigerate
for at least 30 minutes. Combine the tamarind liquid, salt, fish
sauce, sugar, and lemon juice and set aside. Combine ginger, chili
peppers, and shallots, and set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet or
wok until hot but not smoking. Add the shrimp and stir quickly to
separate them. Remove the shrimp when just pink and drain in a
colander. Remove all but two tablespoons of oil from the skillet,
heat the remaining oil over high heat and add the ginger/chile
combination. Stir until fragrant, then add the tamarind sauce. When
boiling hot, add the shrimp and stir over high heat for a minute or
so, until the sauce is reduced. Serve garnished with coriander leaves.
