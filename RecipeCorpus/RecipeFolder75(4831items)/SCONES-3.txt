Title: SCONES 3
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Cream of tartar
1 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1 oz To 2 oz butter
1/4 pt Milk
Measure salt, cream of tartar and bicarbonate of soda and put with
flour. Grease the baking tin.  Sieve dry ingredients you have mixed
together into the bowl. Add the fat, cut into small pieces. Rub the
fat into the mixture until it looks like fine breadcrumbs. Measure a
quarter pint of milk. Make a well in the mixture and gradually add
the milk, mixing with palette knife to form soft dough.  Turn the
dough out on to a floured board or clean kitchen table-top, and knead
it very lightly. When you have finished kneading the dough, form it
into a flat round, roughly 3/4 to 1 inch in thickness.  Cut into
rounds with cutter, and put them on to the greased tin.  Break egg
and beat it with fork. Brush the rounds with the egg. Bake in hot
oven (450F, mark 8) 8-10 minutes. Cool scones on rack. Good
