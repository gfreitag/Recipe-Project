3 tb Butter
2 tb Oil, preferably corn
2 c  Corn kernels, fresh or

1 ea Medium onion, chopped
1/2 ea Medium green bell pepper

To taste
Slice off the tops of the peppers about 1/2 inch down from the
stems. Remove the seeds and cores from the peppers. If any won't
stand upright, slice a little off the bottom, being careful not to
cut into the pepper's cavity. Reserve the peppers and their tops.
Melt the butter and oil in a medium skillet. Add the corn, onion, and
green bell pepper and saute over medium heat until fragrant. Add the
white pepper and salt. Cover the pan and cook for about 10 lminutes.
Remove the lid, add the stock, cream, and hot sauce, and continue
cooking, uncovered, until about half the liquid has evaporated.
Remove the filling from the heat and mix in the cornbread crumbs and
egg white. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the
temperature up to 200 deg to 220 deg F. Grease a smokeproof baking
dish that can hold the peppers snugly upright. Stuff each bell pepper
with a portion of the filling. Replace the tops of the peppers and
secure with toothpicks. Arrange the peppers in the prepared dish.
Transfer the peppers to the smoker. Cook until they are tender but
still hold their shape, 65 to 75 minutes. Remove the toothpicks and
serve the peppers warm.
