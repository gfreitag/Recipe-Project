Title: SHANGHAI DUCK
Categories: Meats, Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
8 lg Scallions,
Cut into 2-inch lengths
2 md Star anise, broken into
16 sections
2 sl Gingerroot,
Half-dollar size
5 lb Duck
1 c  Dark soy sauce
1 c  Light soy sauce
1 c  Water
3/4 c  Sugar.
Honey
Put the scallions, star anise and gingerroot in a heavy pot. Place the
duck, breast sideup in the pot. Mix the remaining ingredients and
pour over the duck. Cover and bring to a boil. Simmer for about two
hours or until tender, turning every half-hour. Remove duck from pan
and place on a shallow dish, rub honey on duck, place duck in a 400
degree oven just until crispy...not too long.  Remove and chop into
small pieces. Reserve liquid and serve at the table as a sauce.
Sometimes I thicken it a little but most of the time we just serve it
as is.
