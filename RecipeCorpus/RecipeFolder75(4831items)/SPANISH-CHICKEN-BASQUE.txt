Drain sun dried tomatoes and cut into 1/2" pieces.

Heat 2 tbsps olive oil in a large flameproof casserole dish and when
it is fairly hot add the chicken and brown until nutty golden on both
sides. Remove to a plate linned with kitchen paper.

Add garlic, chorizo and tomatoes and toss for 1-2 mins. Stir in the

Reduce heat and place chicken gently on top of everything. Sprinkle
over herbs, olives, and onions. Cover and cook over a very low heat
for 50 mins - 1 hour, until rice is cooked, (or cook in oven 180 C
