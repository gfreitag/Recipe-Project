Title: SOUR BUTTER BEANS
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Onion, choped fine
2    Cloves Garlic, crushed
1    Green Chilli (optional)
1 lg Head Broccoli
1 md Courgette/Zucchini, sliced
1 lb Chopped Skinned Tomatoes
1 ts Mixed Herbs
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/2 ts Basil
1 cn Butter Beans (the big ones,
Also called Lima beans?)
1/4 c  Rich vegetable stock
1/4 c  Soya Milk
250 ml Soya Yoghurt
1 ds Lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Corn
1 tb Tomato Puree
Fry the onion, garlic and chilli in a little water or olive oil. Add
the base and stalks of the broccoli (i.e. everything except the
flowerets), and the courgettes. When all this has softened
sufficiently add the tomatoes and the herbs. Leave to simmer
(covered) for fifteen minutes. While that is underway combine the
beans, stock, soya milk, yoghurt, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a
liquidiser until a smooth mixture is obtained. After the fifteen
minutes are up add the bean mixture and simmer uncovered for a
further five minutes. Add the corn and then enough tomato puree to
take away the anaemic look. Serve on its own or with a macaroni style
pasta.
