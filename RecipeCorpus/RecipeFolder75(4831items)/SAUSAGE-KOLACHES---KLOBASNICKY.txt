Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 1/2 dozen
-RoseRay dsjn00a-
1/4 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Sugar
2 pk Yeast
1 c  Warm milk
1 3/4 c  Flour; I use Pillsbury for
- best results
1/2 c  Crisco
1/4 c  Warm milk
1 tb Salt
2    Egg yolks
2 1/4 c  Flour
Beat together warm water, sugar, yeast, 1 cup warm milk and 1 3/4
cups flour thoroughly and let stand for
1    hour.
Add Crisco, 1/4 cup warm milk, salt, egg yolks and 2 1/4 cups
flour. Beat well and let rise until double in bulk, then work down
and make the parts for each sausage roll. Cover the sausage with the
dough you have patted out.  Butter the tops.  Let rise and bake at
400 degrees until golden brown, about 15 minutes. After these are
done, brush with melted butter.
Note.  Cook the sausage first, then cut into length you desire.
