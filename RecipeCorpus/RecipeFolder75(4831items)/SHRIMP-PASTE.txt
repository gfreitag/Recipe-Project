Title: SHRIMP PASTE
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Shrimp, cooked and peeled
1/2 lb Butter
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Celery salt
1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
1/2 ts Nutmeg
Toast crumbs

Grind the shrimp very fine.  Cream the butter until soft and add the
ground shrimp, mixing well.  Then add the seasonings and combine
thoroughly. Place in an oblong baking dish and sprinkle toast crumbs
over the top of the shrimp mixture.  Brown in a hot oven (400) for
about three minutes. Cool and place in the refrigerator until time to
serve (for several hours at least.)

This paste is not as firm as the preceding one, and it has a much more
buttery flavor.  The nutmeg is quite noticeable, although it blends
well with the shrimp. --Mrs. Walter Pringle
