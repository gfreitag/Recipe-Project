Grind the garlic very fine or pound it in a mortar with the
tablespoon of salt.  Or, you may crush it and mix it in a bowl with a
heavy wooden spoon. Rub this mixture on the fish and let it stand for
at least 1 hour, 2 or 3 hours will make it much better.

Prepare a basting sauce with the soy sauce (use more than 2
tablespoons if you like the flavor), the whiskey or brandy, the lemon
juice, and melted butter. Paint the fish with this mixture before and
during cooking. Turn once.  Cook until pleasantly browned and then
sprinkle heavily with sesame seeds.  Continue cooking until the seeds
are well toasted. Serve on a hot platter with wedges of lemon or lime.

Slivers of ginger (fresh or preserved) may be added to the basting
sauce if you like the zest they give.

Serves 4.
