-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 lb Bay scallops
1/4 c  Olive oil; extra-virgin
-preferred
2 md Garlic cloves; minced
1/3 c  Pine nuts (pignoli)
2 tb Salt plus
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1 lb Spaghettini
1    Stick (4 oz) unsalted butter
-melted
3/4 c  Packed fresh basil leaves;
-coarsely chopped
Wash the scallops.  Remove the tough tendon on the side and dry well
on paper towels.

In a large saucepan or flame-proof casserole, heat the oil. Add the
garlic and cook over moderately low heat until softened but not
browned, about 3 minutes.  Add the pine nuts, increase the heat to
moderate and cook, stirring frequently, until the nuts are lightly
browned, about 2 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and season
with 1/2 tsp. of the salt and all of the pepper.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the remaining 2
tablespoons salt and the spaghettini. Cook the pasta until al dente,
8 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, add the scallops to the garlic and pine nut sauce. Cook
over high heat, tossing frequently, until the scallops are just opaque
throughout, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with an
additional pinch of salt and pepper.

Drain the spaghettini, add to the scallops and toss. Add the butter
and basil and toss again.  Serve hot. Makes 6 to 8 servings. Source:
