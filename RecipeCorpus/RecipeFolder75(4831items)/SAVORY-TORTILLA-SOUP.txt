Remove stems and seeds from ancho chilies.  Place chilies in a
saucepan, cover with water and cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
Drain chilies, let cool, then puree in a food processor or blender.
While chilies cook, cut up two tortillas into small pieces.  In a
large saucepan, saute tortillas, onion and garlic in 2 teaspoons
canola oil until onions are soft. Add ancho pepper puree or chili
powder, chicken stock, tomato puree, cumin, oregano and salt to
saucepan.  Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes.
Puree soup in a food processor and return it to saucepan. Stir in
lime juice and reheat. Slice remaining tortillas into 1/4-inch x
2-inch strips. Heat remaining oil in a medium skillet. When oil is
hot, add tortilla strips and saute until crisp, about 2 minutes.
Transfer tortilla strips to a paper towel to drain. Ladle soup into
bowls and top with tortilla strips, cheese and garnishes, as desired.
