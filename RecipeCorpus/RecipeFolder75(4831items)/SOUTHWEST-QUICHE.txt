** peeled, diced green chiles (preferably fresh or, if canned, Hatch,
New Mexico brand)Pre-heat oven to 375 F. In a large mixing bowl, beat
the eggs until light yellow and slightly foamy. Chop onion and sautee
in butter until soft and yellow. Add chopped artichoke bottoms for
the last few minutes. Pour into egg mixture. Add remaining
ingredients and stir until well blended. Place pie crust into 10-inch
straight-sided oven-safe quiche dish. (We use two with fluted sides.)
Pull crust gently into place and flute with fingers. Pour egg mixture
into dish. Bake for approximately 45 minutes until top is nicely
brown and quiche does not "give" when pressed with a gentle finger.
Serve hot, sliced into 8 pieces; or wrap tightly in plastic wrap,
refrigerate and use as much as one week later. Serves
8. NOTE This recipe can be made "guilt free" by substituting Egg
Beaters, skim milk, low-fat cheese, non-creamed corn (drained),
salt-substitute and margarine. Suggested accompaniments: Salsa (ours
is home-made), any type of hot sauce (we serve both red and green
Tobasco), sour cream and/or more green chile.JM.

At The W.J. Marsh House Victorian B&B we usually precede the quiche
with sliced melon, and serve it with home-fried potatoes with
pimiento and green pepper, our piquant Southwest-style cornbread, and
chorizo (spicy Mexican sausage). W.J. Marsh House Victorian Bed &
