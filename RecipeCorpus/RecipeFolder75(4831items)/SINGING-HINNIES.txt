These are hotcakes from the isle of Cape Breton in Nova Scotia.

Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt then rub in
lard (I would use shortening) and margarine. Add currants and milk to
make dough stiff enough to roll 3/4" thick. Cut into thick rounds and
bake on greased griddle or lightly greased electric pan set on low,
until brown. Turn and cook on the other side. Split and spread with
butter and jam.
