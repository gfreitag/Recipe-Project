DRESSING:
1 c  White sugar
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/4 ts Salt

SALAD:

Drain all the beans and chop the vegetables.  Mix together and put
into glass gallon jar. In medium saucepan, mix dressing ingredients
together and then heat until sugar has dissolved. Pour over the beans
and mix thoroughly. Let sit in fridge for at least 24 hours to blend
the dressing and the beans. The longer it sits, the better it is.
Will keep in the fridge for weeks and weeks......

**NOTE**  I find that I have to make 4 times the brine recipe in
order to cover the beans in a one gallon jar.
