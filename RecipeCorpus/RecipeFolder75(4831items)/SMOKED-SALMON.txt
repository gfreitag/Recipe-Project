Yield: 1/3 lb. per person Note: This very expensive delicacy can be
made easily and economically at home. Serve hot or cold with Cucumber
Mayonnaise or Yogurt Dill Sauce. Another note: Frozen seafood should
always be thawed before cooking. The most harm you can do to seafood
is to overcook.  Seafood is done when the flesh turns white or
opazue. The meat will flake easily when forked and shellfish will
feel firm to the touch. If cooked in the shell, the shells will open
when done. Seafood is most delicate and requires short cooking times.
Fish with high fat content will require longer cooking. Recipe from
"Cook'n Cajun Water Smoker Cookbook".
