Title: SESAME SOY SPARERIBS
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Soy sauce
1 c  Water
1 c  Dry white table wine
1/4 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
2    Cloves garlic; minced or mas
1 tb Ground ginger
1/4 c  Sesame seed
3 lb Spareribs
In a large pot, combine first seven ingredients. Cut spare ribs into
serving size pieces (I prefer small back ribs for this recipe) and
place in pot with sauce. bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes,
turning ribs occasionally. Remove ribs from sauce and place in a
single layer in a shallow baking pan. Skim fat from sauce and baste
meat with some of the sauce. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until
tender, occasionally turning and basting with remaining sauce. Broil
ribs for about 5 minutes to finish browning. Note: Par-boiled ribs
can be grilled on the barbecue, but baste with sauce only during the
last 5 minutes. I usually serve these ribs with steamed rice and a
leafy salad. I hope you enjoy these ribs as much as I do. JOYCE in
