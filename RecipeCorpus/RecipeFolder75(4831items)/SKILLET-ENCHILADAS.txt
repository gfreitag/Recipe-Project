Recipe by: "Jessica A. Walton" <ryanja@WKUVX1.WKU.EDU> In a 10-inch
skillet brown the ground beef and onion; drain. Stire in soup,
enchilada sauce, milk and chilies. Reduce heat, cover and cook 20
minutes, stirring occasionally.

In a small skillet dip the tortillas in a little hot cooking oil just
till limp.  Drain.  Reserving 1/2 cup cheese, place 1/4 cup cheese on
each tortilla; sprinkle with olives. Roll up each tortilla. Place in
sauce; cover and cook till heated through, 5 minutes. Sprinkle with
treserved cheese; coverand cook till cheese metls, about 1 minutes.

Makes 4 servings.

Again, I got this recipe from the same Better Homes and Gardens "Easy
Skillet Meals" cookbook, but I make the following changes:

I use cream of celery soup, rather than the cream of mushroom, I use
whole sliced mushrooms, red peppers or jalepenos (whichever I have on
hand) and some diced onions and green peppers within the tortillas. I
also use cheddar cheese instead of American and I tend to be a little
generous on the cheese.  I also put refried beans inside too.

Enjoy!
