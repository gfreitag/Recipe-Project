Title: SABLES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 32 Servings
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Finely ground almonds
1    Lemon's peel, finely grated
1/3 c  Butter; softened
2    Egg yolks
Powdered sugar; sifted
1 pn Salt
Grease several baking sheets with butter.  Stir flour, salt and sugar
in medium-size bowl; mix in almonds and lemon peel. Cut in butter
until mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Add egg yolks and mix to
form a soft dough.  Roll out dough on a floured surface to 1/8-inch
thickness. Using a rolling cookie cutter, cut rectangles from dough.
Place, slightly apart, on prepared baking sheets.  Refrigerate
unbaked 30 minutes. Alternately, cut cookies by hand with a knife or
pastry wheel, cutting in 3" x 1-3/4" strips. Preheat oven to 350 F
(175 C). Bake Sables about 15 minutes or until very lightly browned.
Using a spatula, carefully remove cookies from baking sheets to wire
racks; cool. When cool, sprinkle very lightly with powdered sugar.
