Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Water
1 tb Lemon juice
4 ts Vegetable instant bouillon
1 ts Dried fennel seed, crushed
1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
1    Bay leaf
1 md Onion, finely chopped
1    Stalk celery, chopped
(1/2cup)
2    Garlic cloves, minced
4 md (2 lb) baking potatoes,

3 lg Carrots, thinly sliced
(2cup)
2    (15 5 oz) cans garbanzo
Beans, drained, rinsed
1 c  Packed fresh parsley
Including tender stems,
Chopped (about 1/2cup)
1/8    To 1/4 tsp coarsely ground
Black pepper
In Dutch oven, combine all ingredients except parsley and pepper; mix
well. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 15
to 20 minutes or until vegetables are very tender. Remove bay leaf.
With potato masher, mash vegetables into broth to make a thick chunky
mixture. (Garbanzo beans will not mash as thoroughly as other
vegetables; leave as is for extra texture.) Stir in parsley and
pepper. Serve immediately. Makes 6 (1 1/2 cup) servings.

TIP: To speed preparation, use food processor with metal blade to chop
onion, celery, and garlic. Replace metal blade with thin slicing disk;
slice potatoes and carrots on top of chopped vegetables. Remove all
vegetables from bowl. Clean and dry bowl before chopping parsley with
metal blade.
