Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Chicken, cut up
1/2 lb Butter

Rinse and pat-dry chicken pieces. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Mix
the salt, pepper, bread crumbs and cornstarch thoroughly. Dip each
piece of chicken into the melted butter and then into the bread crumb
mixture. Place the chicken pieces skin-side down, in a shallow baking
pan. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes, then turn each piece
of chicken over, skin-side up, and continue cooking for another 25
minutes, or until each piece is richly browned and can be easily
pierced with a fork. Serve at once. Submitted By PGL@IGLOU.COM (DON
