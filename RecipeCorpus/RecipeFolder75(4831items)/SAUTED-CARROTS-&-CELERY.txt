Title: SAUTÂ‚ED CARROTS & CELERY
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Vegan
Yield: 6 Servings
350 g  Carrots; peeled
1/2    Head of celery, washed
2 tb Olive oil
1 sm Onion; thinly sliced
1    Bouquet garni
50 g  Green olives, stoned
Salt and pepper
A delightful, soft mixture of carrots, celery, onions and olives,
which makes an excellent side-dish to go with the aubergine loaf.

Slice the carrots thinly. Cut the celery sticks into chunks,
discarding any stringy pieces.

Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the onion and celery, and cook gently
until the onion is golden. Add the carrots, celery and bouquet garni
and season to taste. Cover with a lid and cook gently for 10 minutes,
shaking the pan frequently.

Add the olives, stir and replace the lid. Simmer very gently for a
further 10 minutes.
