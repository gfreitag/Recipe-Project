Title: SAVORY OATCAKES
Categories: Side dishes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Oatmeal; * see note
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 oz Bacon fat; lard or margarine
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 pt Hot water
Recipe by: mcivhea@server.uwindsor.ca (Mciver Heather) * plus extra
for dusting.

Melt fat with the hot water.  Add baking soda and salt to the
oatmeal. Make a well in the centre of the oatmeal, pour in the melted
fat and water and mix to a fairly moist dough. On a board, well
dusted with oatmeal, roll out as thinly as possible to an even round,
dusting with oatmeal during the rolling to prevent sticking, and
rubbing in more oatmeal with the palm of your hand.  Cut in farls
(Scotch for quarters) or rounds with a pastry cutter.  Place on a
baking-sheet, ungreased, and bake in a moderate oven, turning several
times to prevent steaming. Bake for approximately 20 minutes, until
the oatcakes are crisp and faintly golden.
