BREAD:  In large bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda. With
pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Stir in raisins or currants (if using). In separate
bowl, combine buttermilk, honey and whisky.  Add all at once to dry
ingredients; stir just until no dry spots remain. Turn dough out onto
lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 1 minute (too much handling
will toughen loaves, while too little will inhibit rising.)  Divide
dough in half and shape each half into an 8 in (20 cm) round. Place
in two greased 8 in (1.2 L) round cake pans. With floured knife, cut
a cross 1/2 in deep in each loaf.
GLAZE:  In small bowl, combine whisky and milk. Brush loaves with
glaze. Bake in 350F (180C) oven 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves
sound hollow when tapped on bottoms. Remove from pans; let cool on
wire racks. Cut into wedges.
