Toast the nuts & seeds in a warm oven for 6-8 minutes, watching
carefully to prevent over-toasting.  Cool. Combine veggies. Break up
noodles and add to veggies. Shortly before serving, add nuts & seeds
& dressing, and toss well (don't dress too far ahead, because you
want the nuts, seeds & noodles to stay crunchy).
