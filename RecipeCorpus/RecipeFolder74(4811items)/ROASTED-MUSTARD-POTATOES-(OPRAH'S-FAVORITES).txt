Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray a roasting pan 3 times to coat
with the vegetable oil. Put the mustard, paprika, cumin, chili
powder, and cayene pepper in a large bowl. Whisk to blend.

Prick the potatoes several times with the tines of a fork and add

between them.

Bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the potatoes are fork
tender.
