2 T  Butter
8    Sweet potatoes
1 T  Sugar
Salt
First, catch a possum.  This in itself is excellent entertainment on a
moonlit night.  Skin the possum and remove the head and feet.  Be
sure to wash it thoroughly.  Freeze overnight, either outside or in a
refrigerator. When ready to cook, peel the potatoes and boil them
tender in lightly salted water along with the butter and sugar.  At
the same time, stew the possum until tender in a tightly covered pan
with a little water. Arrange the taters around the possum, strip with
bacon, sprinkle with thyme or marjoram, or pepper, and brown in the
oven. Baste often with the drippings.
