Title: POTATO CAKES(ENGLISH)
Categories: English
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Left-over mashed potato
3 oz Self-raising flour
2 ts Milk
Salt and pepper
Butter
Knead the flour into the potatoes and milk in a bowl, using as much
flour as can be worked into the potato to enable the mixture to be
rolled out on a floured surface. Cut into circles with a scone
cutter. Lightly grease a griddle or thick frying pan (a wipe with a
butter paper works well). Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side and eat
hot with butter.
