Title: REALLY HARD CIDER
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ga Cider
With the last recipe, you created hard cider.  That will have a max of
about 10% (20 proof) unless you know enough about wine making not to
need to read this. Now lets say it had too much wild yeast and you
don't like the taste or it tastes great but you, purely in the spirit
of the inquiring mind, want to taste the elixir of our ancestors.
You take the result after the bubbling has gone down and put it
in a bowl and freeze it.  The longer and colder the better, 24 hours
at least. It won't all freeze. Put a pie pan under a collander and
pour the slush into it.  Give it a moment and then through away what
is in the collander.
What is left in the pan should be around 25% or 50 proof. A mixed
drink is generally around 40 proof. Let your inquiring mind be warned.
For anyone concerned about US laws (why I have no idea) this
method is not illegal. Submitted By MGIWER@AOL.COM On MON, 30 OCT
