"It used to be the custom to cook Yorkshire Pudding and the Roast
Beef in the same pan. Although it is rarely done today, Yorkshire
Pudding still taste best if it is cooked in the fat that the meat has
been cooked in, so that it absorbed with meat juices. Serve with
Horseradish Sauce." Preheat the oven to 450F. Place the beef fat side
up in the roasting pan and coat with oil. If you like your beef rare,
it should cook for 1 1/4 hours and the meat thermometer should
register between 130F and 140F. If you prefer it medium to well done,
it should cook for 1 1/2 hours and a meat thermometer should register
between 150F and 160F. Baste the meat frequently while it is cooking.
Meanwhile, prepare the batter for the Yorkshire Pudding. Sift the
flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and add
milk and the water gradually, beating well after each addition with a
wooden spoon.
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy. Add them to the
flour mixture. Beat until bubbles rise to the surface. Pour the
batter in a pitcher and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.
When the meat is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a
warm platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let it stand 25 minutes
before carving.
Reheat the batter and pour it quickly into the still hot cooking
pan. Bake it in the oven for 10 minutes at 450F. Then reduce the heat
to 350F and cook it an additional 15 minutes, until it is well risen
and has turned a golden brown. (Do NOT open the oven door while it is
cooking.) Serve immediately from the pan in which it has been cooked.
