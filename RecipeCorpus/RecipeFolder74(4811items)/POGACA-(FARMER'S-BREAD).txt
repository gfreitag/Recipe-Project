Title: POGACA (FARMER'S BREAD)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Pogaca
1/4 c  Fat
2 lb Plain flour
Salt
2/3 c  Yeast cake
1 1/3 c  Water
Rub fat in 1-1/2 pounds flour; add salt and yeast previously
dissolved in a little lukewarm water and mix. Knead well,
occasionally sprinkling the dough with the remaining flour. Dough
must be neither stiff nor soft. Roll the dough out into the size and
shape of a round baking dish. Oil or grease and flour the baking dish
and place the dough in it. Cover. Let it rise for 15 minutes. Prick
with fork, starting 1 inch from the edge and making circles spaced 1
inch from another. If desired, brush with egg yolk. Bake in a hot
oven (425 F) about 1 hour. When it is half done, set the oven on
moderate.  Serve Pogaca cut into a long narrow strip.

Pogaca is often served hot as an appetizer instead of bread. Hot
pogaca filled with sour cream is considered a particularly delicious
specialty.
