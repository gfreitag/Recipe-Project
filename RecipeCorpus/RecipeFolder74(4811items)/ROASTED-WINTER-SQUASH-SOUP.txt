bring to a simmer, then uncover.

cook until soft, about 15 minutes.

6. Remove the squash from its shell. Dice and add to the pot. Simmer
for a few minutes, then pure the soup by passing it through a food
mill or by pulsing it in a blender or food processor.

Can be prepared several hours ahead.

7. When ready to serve, gently reheat the soup. Serve hot with roasted
walnuts sprinkled on top.
