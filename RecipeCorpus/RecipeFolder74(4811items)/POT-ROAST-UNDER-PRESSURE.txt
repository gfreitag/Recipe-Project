Title: POT ROAST UNDER PRESSURE
Categories: Beef

1    Chuck roast or steak 3-5 lb.
1 1/2 c  Beef stock or 1 can beef
-broth
1    Carrot
1    Onion

Brown Meat well then pour stock or broth over it and add the veggies.
Put on lid, lock it down, after steam starts to escape from "hole"
put pressure weight on(is that what you call it??), turn heat down to
medium low and let burble and hiss for 1 hour. Release steam
carefully and gradually. Then remove the "spent" veggies(they were
just for flavor, I give them to the dog) and add fresh veggies of
your choice(carrots, onions, potatoes, celery, etc...) in the
quantities you desire and cook in broth till tender. Then remove the
meat and vegetables and thicken the gravy and enjoy.....
