These refrigerator nut cookies take on a different flavor by
substituting brown sugar to make butterscotch; cinnamon to make
cinnamon slices; or grated orange peel and almonds for orange- almond
slices.

In a large bowl, mix sugar, butter, eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour,
salt, baking soda and nuts. Divide dough into 3 parts. Shape each
part into a roll 1 1/2 inches in diameter and about 7 inches long.
Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours.

Heat oven to 400Ã¸. Cut dough into 1/8-inch slices. Place 1 inch part
on ungreased baking sheets. Bake until light brown, 7-9 minutes.
Immediately remove from baking sheet. Cool on racks.

Variations:

Butterscotch slices: Substitute packed brown sugar for the sugar;
omit nuts.

Cinnamon slices: Substitute 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup
packed brown sugar for the sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon for the
vanilla; omit nuts or not.

Orange-almond slices: Stir in 1 Tablespoon grated orange peel with
the sugar and substitute 1/2 cup finely chopped blanched almonds for
the nuts.
