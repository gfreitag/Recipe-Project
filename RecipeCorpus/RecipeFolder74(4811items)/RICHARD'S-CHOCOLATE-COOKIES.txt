Title: RICHARD'S CHOCOLATE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Snacks
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 lb Butter
6 tb Unsweetened cocoa
1 2/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Rolled oats
Put the milk and butter in the saucepan over medium heat. Add cocoa &
sugar.  Stir well.  Boil 1 minute. Remove from heat. Beat in vanilla
extract and rolled oats. Blend well. Spoon onto cookie sheet. Let cool
until hardened.

The cookies, when cooled, resemble fudge.  But they're very chewy.
