Title: ROAST APRICOTS WITH MASCARPONE & PINE KERNELS
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Apricots
8 oz Mascarpone
2 tb Pine Kernels
2 fl Brandy
5 fl White wine
Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 5/375F/190C. Put the apricots in a
shallow roasting tin and roast for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven,
place over a moderate heat, add the brandy and wine to the roasting
tin and gently remove the apricots. Reduce the sauce over a gentle
heat for two minutes.

In a dry frying pan toast the pine kernels over a moderate heat until
they are golden and set aside.

Peel the apricots, cut in half and gently ease out the stones. Put a
dollop of mascarpone in the middle of each plate, pour the sauce
around the edge, arrange the fruit on top of the sauce and sprinkle
over the pine kernels.
