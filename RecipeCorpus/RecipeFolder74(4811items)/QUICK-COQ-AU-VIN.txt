2 sl Bacon
2    Skinless boneless chicken
Breast halves

2/3 c  Dry red wine

Serve buttered egg noodles and broccoli spears with this streamlined
classic, and a purchased apple tart afterward.

Cook bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium heat until crisp and
brown. Transfer bacon to paper towel and drain. Crumble bacon.

Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Coat with flour; shake off
excess. Add chicken to same skillet and saute over medium heat until
chicken is brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add onions, wine,
broth and thyme to skillet.  Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until onions are tender and
sauce thickens slightly, about 12 minutes; season with salt and
pepper. Return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet. Simmer
chicken until just heated through, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken
to plates. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with bacon.
