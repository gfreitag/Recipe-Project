Title: PSEUDO-MELINDA'S HABANERO PEPPER SAUCE
Categories: Spice, Loo
Yield: 1 Pint
1/2 c  Onion, chopped
2    Garlic, minced
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Carrots, chopped
1/8 c  Water
12    Habaneros, stemmed but
-not seeded, chopped
1/2 c  White vinegar
1/4 c  Lime juice
Saute onions and garlic in oil over medium low heat until soft but not
brown. Add carrots and water. Bring to boil, reduce to low and cook
until carrots are cooked. Remove this mixture to a blender and blend
along with the Habaneros. When smooth, mix in vinegar and lime juice
and simmer briefly. If you are looking to use the sauce immediately,
simmer for 5 min; if you are going to store it, 2 min will be
sufficient but will increase the heat of the sauce to about Melinda's
xxtra sauce heat. You may up to double the Habs before creating a
painfully hot sauce (about as hot as Melinda's reserve) In any case,
this stuff should be packed into sterilized containers for storage
unless you want to drink it up all at once, heh heh.
