Categories: Pork, Low-cal
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Pork loin center rib roast
-(8 ribs)
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper; coarsely ground
1/2 lb Rhubarb, fresh; chopped
-(2 cups)
1/4 c  Apple juice concentrate;
-thawed
2 tb Honey
Nutmeg, ground
2 tb ;Water
1 ts Cornstarch
Have the butcher loosen the pork roast backbone, if possible, for
easier carving.  Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Place bone side
down in a small, shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into
the thickest portion of the roast; make sure bulb doesn't touch bone,
fat, or the pan. Roast, uncovered, at 325 F. until the thermometer
reads 150 F., about 75 to 90 minutes.

For the sauce, in a medium saucepan stir together the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce the
heat, cover, and simmer ten minutes or until the rhubarb is very
tender. Mix the water and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture.
Cook and stir until the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Continue
cooking for two minutes more.

When the meat thermometer registers 150 F., spoon some of the sauce
over the roast.  Continue roasting until the thermometer reads 170
F., about 30 to 45 minutes more. Spoon on additional sauce
occasionally. Let the roast stand 15 minutes before carving.  Heat
any remaining sauce and pass with the roast.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare and roast the pork as directed. For the
sauce, in a 1 1/2-quart microwave casserole cook the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey and nutmeg, covered, on HIGH until the
rhubarb is very tender, about five to seven minutes.  Mix the water
and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture. Cook, uncovered, until
the sauce is thickened and bubbly, about one to two minutes, stirring
every 30 seconds. Continue cooking for one minute more. Spoon over
the roast as directed and pass the remainder with the roast.
