Wash, pare and grate raw potatoes.  Strain but not too dry, and use
juice for soup or sauce.  If juice is retained, a little more flour
will be needed for thickening. Grate and add the onions; add salt and
the egg. Beat well.  Mix reamining ingredients and beat into
potatoes; mix well. Drop by spoonfuls into hot fat that is deep
enough to almost cover the cake. Brown on both sides.  Drain on
absorbent paper.  Serve with applesauce, if desired.
