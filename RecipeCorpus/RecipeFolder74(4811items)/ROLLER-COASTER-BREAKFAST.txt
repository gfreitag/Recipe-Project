Title: ROLLER COASTER BREAKFAST
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
6 ea Eggs
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Milk
2 tb Melted butter
Powdered sugar
Butter 9x13 pan <not pyrex> and put into the freezer while you mix the
batter. Heat oven to 450.

Break eggs into a bowl and beat with fork.  Slowly add flour and beat
well. Add salt, milk and melted butter. Pour into cold pan and bake
at 450 for 18 mins; then
350    for 10 mins.

Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with butter and syrup.

This is sort of a huge piece of French toast in a baking pan that
looks like a roller coaster.  It is fun to watch if you have a glass
door oven. If not, it is a big surprise when you take it out!
