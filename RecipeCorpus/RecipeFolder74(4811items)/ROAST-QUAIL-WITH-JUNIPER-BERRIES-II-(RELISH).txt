Title: ROAST QUAIL WITH JUNIPER BERRIES II (RELISH)
Categories: Relishes, Masterchefs, New york, Tfs
Yield: 6 Cups
1 lg Orange, navel
1 ea Lime
1 tb Ginger, fresh, grated
2 ea Cinnamon, sticks
1 ea Chili, dried
1 ea Vanilla, bean, split
-- lengthwise
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Raisins
2 lb Cranberries, fresh
Cut the orange and lime, with their skins, into a 1/4-inch dice.
Set aside.

Tie the ginger, cinnamon sticks, chili and vanilla bean in
cheesecloth and set aside.

Place the sugar in a heavy large skillet, preferably one with
straight sides.  Stir constantly over high heat until sugar turns
light amber. The sugar must be cooked carefully to prevent burning;
break up lumps as you go.  (If there are still lumps of sugar after
it begins to color, work over low heat, or off heat, until mixture is
smooth.)

Stir in the orange, the lime and the bag of spices, and cook
over high heat, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.  Fold in the
raisins and cranberries, stirring gently to coat with caramelized
sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring gently, until about half of
the cranberries pop open, about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the
heat and cool.

Remove the bag of spices and spoon the relish into sterilized
jars. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 1 month.  This relish keeps
about 3 months.
