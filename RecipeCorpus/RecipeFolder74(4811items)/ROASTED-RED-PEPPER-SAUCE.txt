Title: ROASTED RED PEPPER SAUCE
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Jar roasted red peppers
(probably about 12 ounces)
Or roast your own.
1    Handful basil
1/2    Handful italian parsley
4    Heads of garlic-- make that
4    Cloves for normal people
&^)
1/2 c  Stock (if necessary to
Thin)
Process the above in a food processor until smooth. Toss with 1 pound
cooked pasta of your choice and serve. If you refrigerate it first,
be sure to get it to room temperature before tossing. It probably
freezes well, but I haven't tried it.

Buon appetito!
