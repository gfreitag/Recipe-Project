1 c  cream cheese -- softened
1/2 c  creamy peanut butter
**CHOCOLATE GLAZE:
:
1/2 c  water
4 TB unsalted butter
1/2 c  cocoa -- sifted

In large mixing bowl, cream butter and peanut butter until light and
fluffy. Add brown sugar. Mix to blend. Add eggs, one at a time,
mixing well after each addition.

In small bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add flour
mixture to butter and peanut butter mixture alternately with milk,
beginning and ending with flour mixture. Add vanilla.

Pour batter into 2 well-greased and floured 9 inch cake pans. Bake in
preheated 350 degree oven until cake tests done, about 45 minutes.
Cool on wire rack to room temperature before frosting the cake.
Spread half of Peanut Butter Filling over tops of each cake, using
metal spatula dipped in hot water. Spread glaze over cake while glaze
is warm. As glaze cools, it will thicken.

PEANUT BUTTER FILLING: Cream ingredients together until light and
fluffy.

CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Place water and butter in small saucepan. Bring to a
boil. Add cocoa, sugar and vanilla to water mixture. Mix until smooth.

CHEF'S NOTE: This recipe will make either two 9-inch cakes or one
stacked layer cake. If making the stacked layer cake, the Peanut
Butter Filling should be put between the layers and on top ofthe cake
before topping it with the Chocolate Glaze.

(There was no information on how many servings this recipe will make.)
