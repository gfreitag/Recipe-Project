6    Egg
1/2 ts Salt

1 pt Heavy cream; whipped
16 oz Cherry pie filling
1 T  Kirschwasser
12    Glazed red cherries

1    Milk chocolate; bar or chunk
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease two 9" layer-cake pans.  In a
large bowl, beat the eggs until thick.  Gradually add sugar, beating
con- stantly. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt
together. Care- fully fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture
alternately with the melted butter.  Add vanilla.  Pour into the pans
and bake for about 25 minutes.  The center of the cake should feel
firm to the touch. While still warm, sprinkle Kirschwasser over the
layers. Let set 10 minutes, then remove the layers from the pans to
cool completely.

To the whipped cream, add the Kirschwasser and sugar.  Spread half of
the cherry filling over one layer of cake.  Cover with a thin layer of
whipped-cream mixture.  Place the second layer of the cake on the
first. Spread with the remaining cherry filling and cover with
whipped-cream mixture.  Ice the sides of the cake with a thin layer
of the whipped cream.Decorate around the top edge of the cake with
rosettes of whipped cream. Put a glazed cherry in each rosette.  Make
chocolate curls by shaving solid chocolate with a vegetable peeler.
Sprinkle the chocolate on the top of the cake.  Put a little
chocolate on the sides of the cake if you wish.
