MMMMM--------------------------BROWNIES-------------------------------
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1/2 c  Unsalted butter at room temp
1 1/4 c  Plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
3    Large eggs at room temp

1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1/4 c  Evaporated milk
1/3 c  Sugar

BROWNIES: Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly grease an 8-inch square
baking pan. Melt chocolate and butter in a small saucepan over low
heat. Cool 5 minutes. Put sugar and chocolate mixture in a
medium-size bowl. Beat with electric mixer until blended. Add
vanilla. With mixer on medium-low speed, add eggs, one at a time,
beating after each until blended. Scrape bowl with rubber spatula. On
low speed beat in flour until blended. Stir in 1/2 cup nuts. Spread
batter in prepared pan. Bake 35 minutes or until thin crust forms on
top and tester inserted in center comes out with a moist crumb.
(Center shouldn't rise as high as edges. Cool on wire rack before
frosting. FROSTING: Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler or bowl
placed over simmering water. Pour evaporated milk, sugar and melted
chocolate into blender. Blend on medium-low speed 50 seconds or until
thickened (sound of machine will change when this happens). Spread
over cooled brownies. Frosting will remain soft, but will set and
become more firm. Sprinkle with remaining walnuts. Let stand 1 hour
before cutting in squares. NOTE1: Frosting recipe may be doubled for
a thicker layer of frosting. NOTE2: Make a day ahead so flavor can
develop!
