Contributed to the echo by: Lisa Zech Raspberry Angel Food First you
will need to buy angel food cake! Then buy some rasberrys that are in
the process of jucieness. Put them on a straight plate with no curves
at the side. Mash them down. After you mash them down, put them on
the cake. Then buy some rasberry juice. You put that in a bowl. Then
you get whole berries and put them in the juice. Stir around, but try
not to kill the rasberries (all of them.) Then put that on the cake
and put all the types of fruit you want!
