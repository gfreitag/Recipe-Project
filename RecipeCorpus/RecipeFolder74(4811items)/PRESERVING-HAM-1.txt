Title: PRESERVING HAM 1
Categories: Info/tips, Preserves
Yield: 1 Servings  ================== Information file ================== Rub your ham,
which should be of fine grained, well fed pork, when quite cold, with
fine salt, to which add a little red pepper, and half a pinto of
molasses. Let it remain in the pickle, basting and turning it for six
weeks. Then hang it up, and smoke for six weeks. About the first week
in April take it down; wash it in cold water, and rub it over with
unleached ashes. If you have any number of hams, let them lie for a
week, heaped together; then hang them in a cool room, having sewn
them in canvass or old cotton covers.
