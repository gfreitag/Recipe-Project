Title: QUINOA WITH LEEK & CURRANTS
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 3/4 c  Quinoa
2 2/3 c  Vegetable stock (or water)
4 sm Leeks
1/2 c  Canned tomatoes (or 2 roma
-size tomatoes)
5 tb (rounded 1/4 cup) currants
1 tb Ground cumin
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Turmeric
Slice leeks in half length-wise.  Wash all of the larger leaves very
well (leeks are very dirty.  If you don't wash it well enough your
final dish will be gritty). Chop washed leeks cross-wise into thin
slices.

Place quinoa in a fine-meshed colander and rinse well for several
minutes. You want to remove the bitter coating of saponin that quinoa
sometimes has. You can also do this in a regular bowl if you are
careful (fill with water, swirl qunioa around, pour out water, repeat
until water is clear).

Place leeks in nonstick pan and cook until limp and reduced (no need
to add liquid, leeks will have some water from being washed and tend
to give up liquid as they cook).

Add spices to the leeks and stir until well mixed.

Add quinoa and cook for a couple minutes.

Add stock[, currants,] and tomatoes, bring to a boil, lower heat and
simmer, covered, for 15-20 minutes until done.
