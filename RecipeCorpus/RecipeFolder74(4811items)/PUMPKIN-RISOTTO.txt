Categories: Digest, Nov., Thanksgivin
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Pumpkin flesh, peeled and
Cubed
4    Shallots, chopped
5 c  Chicken-like or veggie
Stock
2 c  Arborio rice (Japanese rice
Also works)
1/2 ts Powdered saffron (optional)
1 c  Dry white wine (sub. water
Or stock)
1 tb Fresh sage
x  Salt & freshly ground black
Pepper
Wrap cubed pumpkin in foil and bake at 350o for 30 min. While it is
baking, saute shallots in a little white wine, water or stock. In a
seperate pan, bring the stock to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer.
Puree pumpkin and set aside. Add rice to shallots and cook 2-3
minutes over moderate heat stirring frequently. Add wine and saffron
and cook, stirring constantly until all the lquid has been absorbed.
Add the pumpkin and 1 c stock stirring constantly. After that is
absorbed, add the stock 1/2 cup at a time stirring constantly until
absorbed until the rice is cooked (about 15-20 min).  If you run out
of stock add hot water. The risotto should be thick and creamy in
consistensy and just a little runny. When done remove from heat, add
the sage, salt and pepper to taste. If you want to add 1/4 c grated
parmesan it would add 1 gram fat/ serving.
