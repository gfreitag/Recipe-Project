Recipe by: Joel Ehrlich <Joel.Ehrlich@SALATA.COM> Preheat the oven to
450 degrees. Fry the bacon in a large skillet. Rinse the chicken
inside and out, removing the giblets. Pat dry with paper towels. Set
aside. Combine 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings with the peanut
oil to saute the onion until it is golden brown. Combine the bread,
parsley, cheese, garlic, pepperoni, egg, all the seasonings, the
diced sauteed bacon and the onion in a large bowl. Moisten with
chicken broth. Stuff the cavities of the chicken (don't forget the
neck cavity) with the mixture. Tie, skewer or suture the cavities.
Rub the chicken with the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper
(red and black). Place the chicken, breast side up, in a pan. Roast
for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Turn the
chicken breast side down. Roast for 2 hours. Serve hot.
