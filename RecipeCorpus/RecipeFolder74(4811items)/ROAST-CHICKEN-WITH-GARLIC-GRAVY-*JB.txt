Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Whole chicken (3 lbs)
1 ts Dried thyme
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
10    Garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 cn (10 1/2 oz.) low-salt
--chicken broth, divided
Cooking spray
1 tb All-purpose flour
Preheat oven to 325F.

Remove and discard giblets and neck from chicken. Rinse chicken under
cold water; pat dry.  Trim excess fat. Starting at neck cavity,
loosen skin from breast and drumsticks by inserting fingers, gently
pushing between skin and meat.  Rub thyme, salt and pepper on breast
and drumsticks under loosened skin; place 2 garlic cloves in body
cavity. Lift wing tips up and over the back; tuck under chicken.  Set
aside.

Combine 8 garlic cloves, wine, and half of broth in a shallow
foil-lined roasting pan.  Place chicken on a rack coated with cooking
spray; place rack in pan.

Bake at 325F for 1 hour and 45 minutes or until meat thermometer
registers 180F.  Discard skin.  Place chicken on a platter, reserving
pan drippings; set chicken aside. Keep warm.

Place flour in a small saucepan.  Gradually add remaining half of
broth, stirring with a whisk until blended. Set aside. Place a
zip-top plastic bag inside a 2-cup measure.  Pour pan drippings into
bag; let stand 10 minutes (fat will rise to the top).  Seal bag;
carefully snip off 1 bottom corner of bag.  Drain drippings into
broth mixture in saucepan, stopping before fat layer reaches opening;
discard fat.  Bring mixture to a boil; cook 1 minute or until thick,
stirring constantly with a whisk. Serve gravy with chicken.
