Title: POT-ROASTED SALMON WITH OLIVES & PRESERVED LE
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Salmon Cutlets
Olive oil
Salt and pepper
4    Carrots
6 oz Green Beans
4 oz Pitted Black Olives
1    Preserved Lemon
6 oz Fish stock
1 tb Chopped Parsley
Preserved lemons are salted lemons - cut a vertical cross in each
lemon and stuff with sea salt - preserve in lemon juice for a few
weeks in an air-tight jar. If you don't have them use ordinary
lemons. The advantage of the preserved ones is their mildness and
tenderness, so you can eat them. The unpreserved ones tend to be too
bitter. If you don't have fish stock use 3 oz each white wine and
water.

Method: Brown the fish in olive oil using the casserole you will use
for the roasting. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Peel and
trim the carrots and cut lengthways into thin strips. Top and tail
the beans and roughly chop the black olives. In the same pan lightly
colour the vegetables in hot oil. Add the black olives and preserved
lemon, cut into eight segments, and toss in the oil.

Pour over the stock, bring to the boil, lower the heat, lay the fish
on top and cover with the lid, and tinfoil if using. Cook over a
moderate heat for eight minutes, basting the fish twice during the
process. Remove the fish and keep warm. Continue cooking and
vegetables with the lid off until tender. Serve with the fish on top
and sprinkling of parsley.
