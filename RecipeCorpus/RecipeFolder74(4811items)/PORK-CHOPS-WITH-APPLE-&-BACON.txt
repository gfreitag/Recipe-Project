Bacon, halved

Saute the bacon until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp. Drain on
paper towel. Drain and reserve most of the fat. Core and wedge the
apples. Saute the apples over medium heat in the same pan until they
are soft, but not mushy. The cut edges should brown and caramelize.
Remove the apples with a slotted spoon and keep warm.

In a brown paper bag place the flour, salt and pepper. Shake to mix.
Shake the pork chops in the seasoned flour. Fry the pork chops in the
reserved fat over medium-high heat until they are browned, turning
once. Serve the chops on warmed plates, covered with the apple and 4
pieces of bacon per chop. Makes 6 servings.
