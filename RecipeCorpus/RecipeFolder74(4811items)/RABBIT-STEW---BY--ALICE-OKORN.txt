This recipe is from a great old paperback  cookbook My husband gave
me when we were in high school some 25 years ago. I've enjoyed many
of the recipes. Alice was raised in Napoleon, Missouri and she and
her husband farmed organically many years before it was fashionable.
I also have a recipe for Chicken fried rabbit and another rabbit stew
if you want.
