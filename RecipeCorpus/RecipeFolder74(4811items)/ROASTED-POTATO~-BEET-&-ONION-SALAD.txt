Halve or quarter potatoes lengthwise. Toss potatoes and garlic cloves
with 2 tablespoons olive oil and herb sprigs. Season liberally with
salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer on a baking pan, cover
with foil and set aside.

Toss onions and beets separately with remaining oil and season with
salt and pepper. Wrap onions and beets separately in foil. Roast
onions, beets and potatoes in a preheated 375 degree oven for 35 - 40
minutes or until vegetables are tender. Uncover potatoes after 20
minutes to allow them to brown and crisp slightly. Unwrap beets and
onions carefully, reserving any juices for Balsamic Vinaigrette. Slip
skins off beets, if desired.

Arrange roasted vegetables attractively on plates and drizzle with
Balsamic Vinaigrette. Place a small mound of Herb Salad in center and
garnish with baby green beans, peas and pea tendrils if available.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
