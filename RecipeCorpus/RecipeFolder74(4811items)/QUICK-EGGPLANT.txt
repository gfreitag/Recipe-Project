x  Garlic
x  Fresh ground pepper
x  Salt

x  Cooked pasta
x  Parmesan
I use eggplant often, both peeled and unpeeled (in ratatoile). Quick
recipe --

bake (or roast) at 350 for one hour (poke holes first). Take out and
let cool -- the eggplant(s) will deflate like a balloon and will smell
heavenly! When slightly cool, peel and smush up with fork. Add garlic,
fresh ground pepper and salt if you want. Reheat in just a tiny bit of
olive oil (hope this is ok to say, this is my first post) in a
non-stick skillet.  Serve over pasta with (again hope this is ok) a
little grated parmesan.  This is a great easy afterwork recipe.
