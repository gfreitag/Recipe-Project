Stephen Ceideburg
2 lb White Rose potatoes
6 tb Unsalted butter, clarified
2 lg Leeks *
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Finely ground pepper
* white and green parts, cleaned and finely chopped

This makes one big pancake, to be eaten by cutting into wedges and
serving more as an accompaniment than a main course. Adapted from
Diane Worthington's "The Cuisine of California" (J. P. Tarcher).

Peel potatoes and soak in cold water for 30 minutes.

Grate and squeeze out every bit of moisture by wringing the potatoes
in dry dish towels.

Heat 2 tablespoons butter in heavy frying pan; add leeks and saute
until wilted. Season with salt and pepper, then add to potatoes and
mix well.

Heat remaining butter in a heavy skillet, preferably a nonstick one,
and add potato-leek mixture. Flatten to make a pancake, then cover
and cook about 5 minutes over medium-high heat.

Turn pancake and cook until brown and crisp.

Invert onto a serving platter and slice with serrated knife or pizza
cutter into wedges.
