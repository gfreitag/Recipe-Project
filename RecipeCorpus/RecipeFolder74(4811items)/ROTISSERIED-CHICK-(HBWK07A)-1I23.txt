Title: ROTISSERIED CHICK (HBWK07A) 1I23
Categories: Chicken, Bar-b-q
Yield: 2 Servings
1 ea Sm Onion
2 c  Garlic-minced
1 x  Vermouth
1 x  Soy sauce-dark
1 x  Salt and pepper-fresh ground
1 x  Garlic powder
1 x  Celery seeds
1 x  Paprika
1 x  Oregano-crushed
1 x  Basil
Ed, first I peel and stuff the chicken with a small onion and a
couple of garlic cloves, mashed; then after trussing and putting on
the spit, I shake a little vermouth over it, then a little dark soy
sauce, salt and freshly ground pepper lemon pepper if you have it,
garlic powder, celery seeds, and LOTS of paprika; then I put on
crushed oregano or basil onto the grill or in the oven/spit and cook
until thigh juices run clear. The paprika is heavy enough to almost
form a crust so the juices stay in the chicken..... My son who cooks
this for his friends calls it 'Monogram O Chicken'... In fact, he
cooked it one time on television in Fukui, Japan...but they never
understood the reason for calling it 'Monogram O Chicken'!!!
