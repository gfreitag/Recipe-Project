Title: PUMPKIN COFFEE CAKE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1/4 c  Milk, scalded
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Butter or margarine
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (105-15 degrees
-F.)
1    Egg, lightly beaten
2 1/4 c  Unsifted flour (about)
1    Egg yolk, beaten with 1
-tablespoon cold water
-(glaze)
Filling:
3/4 c  Cooked, mashed pumpkin
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
1/4 c  Seedless raisins
Frosting:
1/2 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
1 ts Milk or light cream
1/8 ts Vanilla
Dough:

Mix milk with sugar, salt, and butter, stirring until sugar disolves;
cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir until
disolved.

Combine milk and yeast mixtures add egg and half the flour, and beat
until smooth and elastic, adding only enough extra flour to keep
dough from sticking. Place dough in a greased bowl, turn to grease
all sides, cover with cloth, set in a warm, draft-free place, and let
rise about 1 hour until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, turn onto
a lightly floured board, and roll into a rectangle about 22"x10". Mix
pumpkin with sugar, spieces, and salt and spread evenly over dough,
not quite to edges. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup walnuts and the raisins.
Roll up jelly-roll fashion from the wide side, lify to a greased
baking sheet, and coil into a ring. Cover and let rise in a warm
place about 1 hour until doubled in bulk. Meanwhile, preheat oven to
350 degrees F. Brush ring with egg glaze and bake 30-35 minutes until
well browned and hollow sounding when tapped. Mix frosting
ingredients together until smooth and frost ring while still warm;
sprinkle with remaining nuts. Serve warm or at room temperature.
