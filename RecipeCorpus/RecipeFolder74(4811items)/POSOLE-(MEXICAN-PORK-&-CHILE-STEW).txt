Categories: Ethnic, Soups/stews, Meats, Seafood
Yield: 12 Servings
2 lb Pork roast,cut in chunks
2 ea Pork shanks or pigs feet
2 c  Posole
2 ea Cloves garlic, mashed
4 ea Red chili pods,remove seeds
1/2 lb Pork rinds (skins)
1 tb Salt
1 ts Oregano
2 tb Chopped onion
Place meat and pork rinds and pork shanks in a large kettle and add
about 5 quarts of water or enough to cover meat. Add approximately 1
tablespoon salt and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat for about
1 1/2 hours. Remove excess grease and set aside. Reserve liquid. Wash
the posole very carefully until the water is clear so as to remove
lime from kernels. Put in large kettle and cover with water. Boil
until posole has popped. Mix meat, posole, rind and shanks or pigs
feet. Add oregano, garlic, onion and chili pods. Let simmer for about
1/2 hour. Posole may be served as a main dish with hard rolls,
tortillas or crackers. Additional red chili sauce may be added at
serving time for more spice. NOTE:Posole can be found in the meat
section if it is available in your area, if not available, hominy can
be substituted in the same quantities but no rinsing or pre-cooking
is needed. The posole will lose its authenticity but none of its
tastiness if pork rinds, pork shanks or pigs feet are omitted. You
can also add one can of tomatoes to enhance the flavor.
