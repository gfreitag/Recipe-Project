Title: QUICK MACADAMIA CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Garlic clove, pressed
4    Chicken breasts, boned
1/4 ts Dill
1/2    Sweet red pepper
1/4 lb Green beans (optional)
1 lg Tomato
1/8 lb Macadamia nuts
4 tb Honey
1/8 ts Sesame seeds
Sesame oil
Slice or chop all ingredients.  Saute the garlic in the sesame oil,
until just fragrant. Add the dill and the chicken, and saute for
about five minutes. Add the green beans and the red pepper; saute for
another couple of minutes. Add the tomato and the macadamia nuts;
saute another minute or two.  Add the honey and the sesame seeds.
Continue cooking just long enough to warm the honey.

NOTES:

*  Quick and easy chicken with macadamia nuts and honey -- I devised
this recipe last year.  We like it a lot, and it's very quick.

*  This is wonderful served with couscous.  I recommend using chicken
broth when cooking the couscous.

*  If you want to take the time, you can thicken the sauce with about
1/4 t arrowroot, or some cornstarch.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
