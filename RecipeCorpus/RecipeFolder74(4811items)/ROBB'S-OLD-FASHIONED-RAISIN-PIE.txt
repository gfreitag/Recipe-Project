Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  Dark seedless raisins
1 1/2 c  Fresh orange juice
1 c  Boiling water
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Light brown sugar, packed
3 tb Cornstarch
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground cloves

2 ts Grated lemon rind
2 ts Grated orange rind
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 tb Butter
1    Egg, well-beaten
1    Pastry for 2-crust pie
Add raisins to orange juice and boiling water, simmer until tender
(3-5 minutes).  Combine sugars, cornstarch, ground cinnamon, ground
cloves, and salt; stir into hot raisins. Cook slowly, stirring
constantly, to full rolling boil; boil 1-2 minutes, or until
transparent and thickened. Remove from heat.

Blend in lemon rind, orange rind, lemon juice and butter, stirring
well. Allow to cool slightly.  Blend in beaten egg, stirring well.

Pour warm filling into pastry-lined pie pan.  Cover with lattice
strips, weaving strips into basket-weave pattern. Bake in 425-degree
oven for 30-40 minutes, or until pastry is brown and filling is
bubbling. Serve slightly warm, plain, or with whipped cream.
