Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Heavy Cream
1/2 lb Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled
1/2 ts Nutmeg, grnd
2 tb Butter
3/4 c  Parmesan, grated
Heat cream to simmering, do not boil. Add Gorgonzola, salt, pepper

a wooden spoon until it's thoroughly mixed. Cook rigatoni al dente,

[It's worth a trip to the Italian deli to get a GOOD hunk of
Gorgonzola for this!]
