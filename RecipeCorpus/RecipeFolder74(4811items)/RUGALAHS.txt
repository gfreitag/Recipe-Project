Although this recipe can be halves, it's worth making mounds of these
melt in your mouth cinnamon crescents, since they freeze perfectly
and thaw quickly. Rugalahs can be frozen either baked or unbaked. To
bake frozen rugalahs, allow an extra five minutes cooking time.

In large bowl, using pastry blender or 2 knives, cut butter into flour
until mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Cut in cream cheese until
dough feels moist. Knead dough until you can gather into large ball.
Divided into 8 pieces. Wrap individually and refrigerate at least 1
hour or overnight. (Let dough stand at room temperature for about 15
minutes before rolling)  In medium bowl combine brown sugar, cinnamon
and cocoa. Stir in hazelnuts.  Set aside until ready to use. On
lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into circle 10
inches in diameter. Spread about 2 tbsp jam over each circle;
sprinkle with some brown sugar mixture. Cut circle into 10-12 equal
wedges. Roll up each one from outside, curving slightly to form
crescent.  Place about 2 inches apart on greased or parchment lined
baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining peices of dough. Beat together
egg and salt and brush it onto each cookie. Sprinkle with coarse
sugar or nuts. Bake in 350 F oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden.
Makes 96 crescents.
