Categories: Xmas, Holidays, Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Goose  (9 to 12 lbs)
Salt
4 c  Wild rice; cooked
2/3 c  Hazelnuts; coarsely chopped
2 lg Apples; green colored,
.  peeled, cored & cubed
1/2 c  Onion, finely chopped
2 ts Dried savory
3 tb Parsley; chopped
Black pepper; freshly ground
Flour
Remove the neck, heart, and gizzard from the goose and put them in a
saucepan with 4 cups of water.  Let simmer gently, partially covered,
for several hours, until reduced to slightly less than 2 cups. Season
the broth to taste with salt.

For the stuffing; mix together the wild rice, nuts, apples, onion, and
herbs, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity of the
goose with the stuffing, skewer closed, and lace string around the
skewers, then truss the bird. Roast in a preheated 325 degree oven,
breast side down, for 11/2 hours, drawing off the fat as it
accumulates, then turn and roast another 11/2 hours, or slightly more
for an ll-12-pound bird. When done, the juices should run clear when
the bird is pricked where the thigh attaches to the body.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat, then sprinkle a little
flour over the bottom of the roashng pan-1 to 2 tablespoons,
depending on how thick you like your gravy. Set the pan over low heat
and stir for 2 minutes, scraping up all the browned bits. Add the
reserved goose broth and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with
salt and pepper and serve in a gravy boat alongside the bird. Remove
trussing strings and skewers before carving.
