Title: POTATO GARBANZO GNOCCHIS
Categories: Pasta, Gluten-free
Yield: 1 Recipe
2 c  AM Potato Flakes
2 c  Boiling water
1/2 c  Garbanzo Flour
1/4 c  Rice Flour
1 tb Smoked nutritional yeast
-- (optional)
1 ts Sea salt
1 ts Non-alum baking powder
-- (optional)
1 ts Garlic powder
1/8 ts Cayenne or red pepper
Combine water and potato flakes quickly.  They will set up firmly and
be somewhat dry.  Stir in the remaining ingredients. Drop by the
teaspoonful onto hot oil and deep fry until golden brown. Omitting
the baking powder will result in denser gnocchis.
