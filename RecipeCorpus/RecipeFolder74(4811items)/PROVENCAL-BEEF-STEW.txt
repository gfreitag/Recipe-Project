Recipe by: the California Culinary Academy Preparation Time: 18:0 1.
Trim meat of excess fat and cut into 2-inch cubes. In a large bowl,
whisk together vinegar, 2 tablespoons of the oil, salt, pepper, bay
leaf, garlic, thyme, and orange peel. Add meat, cover bowl with
plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 12 to 18 hours. Drain meat,
reserving marinade. Pat meat dry with paper towels.

2. In a Dutch oven or large skillet with lid, heat remaining 2
tablespoons olive oil over moderately high heat. Brown meat well on
all sides. Add wine and reserved marinade. Bring to a simmer and
cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to maintain a bare
simmer. Cover and cook until meat is meltingly tender (about 3
hours). For best flavor, allow stew to cool to room temperature, then
refrigerate, covered, overnight. Reheat gently to serve. Ladle stew
into warm soup bowls, over buttered noodles, if desired, and garnish
each serving with parsley.
