Title: QUICKY CRUMBLE
Categories: Breakfast, Cereals, Desserts
Yield: 1 Serving
Whole wheat Shreddies
3 tb Butter or margarine
1    Grannysmith or Macintosh
-apple, cored
1 tb Brown sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
Measure as much cereal as you want in your bowl (I use about 2 cups).
Crush to fine crumbs in blender, or place in a plastic bag, hold it
shut, and crush with the heel of your hand. Pour into medium mixing
bowl. In a one-cup measure, microwave the butter on 100% power until
melted; work butter into crumbs until mixture is moist and crumbly.
Slice apple into thin, even slices, then place in microwave-safe,
shallow baking dish. Spread cereal mixture evenly over apple slices.
Microwave on 50% power 3 min, or until heated through and apple is
tender. Sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar; microwave on 50%
power 2 min longer. Serve hot with a little milk, a pat of butter or
jam, or some fresh fruit.

Variations: I have enjoyed this dish with banana slices in place of
the apple. Also, substitute 1 tb your favorite jam for 1 tb of the
butter. Stir the jam into the butter in the cup immediately after
butter is melted. Try using an uncooked hot cereal, such as Cream of
Wheat or Quaker Oat bran in place of the Shreddies, for a deliciously
different porridge. Serve with whipped cream, ice cream or yogurt for
dessert.
