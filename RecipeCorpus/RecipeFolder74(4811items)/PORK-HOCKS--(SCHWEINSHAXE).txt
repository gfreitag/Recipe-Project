Melt fat or shortening in an enamel-lined, cast-iron pan. Add drained
pork hocks, cooked vegetables and a small amount of cooking liquid.
Bake 30 minutes. Moisten meat frequently with more cooking liquid.
Before meat is fully cooked, sprinkle with beer or water in which a
good amount of salt has been dissolved. Add cumin to increase flavor,
if desired. Serve with potato or white bread dumplings or sauerkraut
salad. Note: In Bavaria, the juices and cooking liquid are strained
and served as an accompanying sauce.
