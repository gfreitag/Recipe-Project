Title: RICOTTA CHEESE
Categories: Cheese
Yield: 6 Servings
1 qt Milk
2 tb Lemon juice
Put the milk in saucepan over low heat and bring to the scalding
point 150 F. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice, the milk will
curdle. Let the mix sit without refrigeration for 2 - 12 hours. This
is the mellowing process and it seems the more patient you are the
mellower the cheese. Put 2 thicknesses of cheesecloth in a strainer

the whey to drain several hours until the curd is dry. This is a
Mennonite recipe.
