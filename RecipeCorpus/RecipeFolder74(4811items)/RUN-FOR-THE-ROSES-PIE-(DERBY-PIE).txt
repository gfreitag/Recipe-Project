Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  All-purpose Flour
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Margarine, melted and cooled
1 c  Walnuts, broken
1 c  Chocolate chips
1 ts Vanilla
1    9" unbaked pie shell (or one
Pillsbury refrigerated pie
Crust)
Mix sugar and flour. Add eggs, then margarine, walnuts, chocolate
chips and vanilla. Pour into unbaked pie crust and bake 30 minutes in
a preheated 350Ã¸ oven. You may have to bake it a little longer,
because ovens vary. It should be chewy but not runny. This is best
served warm with ice cream, whipped cream, or Cool Whip. Note:
Because of Kern's Bakery's copyright, this can not be called Derby
Pie.
