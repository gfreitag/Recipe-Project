Title: ROYAL FROSTING
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 3 Cups
3 x  Egg whites, room temp.
1 lb Confectioner's sugar, sifted
-about 4-3/4 c.
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
Food coloring as desired
Combine all ingredients in small, deep mixing bowl. Beat with electric
mixer 7-10 minutes until frosting is very stiff. Divide into separate
bowls and add food coloring as desired. Keep each bowl covered with a
damp cloth -- this frosting dries quickly when left exposed to the
air. Use pastry tube to decorate cookies as desired. Allow to dry
before stacking. The thicker the design, the longer it will take to
dry.

This recipe is also good for making rosettes and other shapes. Larger
shapes should be allowed to dry for several hours or overnight before
being handled.  Use a little dab of additional frosting to *glue* in
place on sides of cakes.
