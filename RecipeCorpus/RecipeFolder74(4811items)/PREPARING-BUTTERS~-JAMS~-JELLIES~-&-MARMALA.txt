Yield: 1 Guide  METHODS OF MAKING JAMS AND JELLIES

There are two basic methods of making jams and jellies. The standard
method, which does not require added pectin, works best with fruits
naturally high in pectin. The other method, which requires the use of
commercial liquid or powdered pectin, is much quicker. The gelling
ability of various pectins differs. To make uniformly gelled
products, be sure to add the quantities of commercial pectins to
specific fruits as instructed on each package. Overcooking may break
down pectin and prevent proper gelling. When using either method,
make one batch at a time, according to the recipe. Increasing the
quantities often results in soft gels. Stir constantly while cooking
to prevent, burning. Recipes are developed for specific jar sizes. If
jellies are filled into larger jars, excessively soft products may
result.
