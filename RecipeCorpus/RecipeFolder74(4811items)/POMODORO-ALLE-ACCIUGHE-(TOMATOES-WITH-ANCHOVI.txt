A good Italian antipasti spread always demonstrates the wisdom of
simplicity and this tomato antipasto proves the point again.

Make a dressing by combining the oil drained from a tin of anchovies
with the juice of a lemon, freshly coarse-ground pepper and half a
tablespoon of chopped fresh oregano. Set aside to allow the flavour
to improve.

Cut 4 ripe tomatoes into lengthwise wedges and arrange on a platter
draping an anchovy fillet over each wedge. Pour the dressing over the
tomatoes and serve the antipasto with crispy pane de casa from a good
Italian bakery.

Makes 4 servings.
