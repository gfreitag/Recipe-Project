Categories:
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Idaho Potatoes
Sea salt
2    Eggs
1 c  Flour
Salt and pepper to taste
For the Mushrooms:
1/2 c  Fresh Morels
1/2 c  Fresh Porcini
1/2 c  Shitake mushrooms
1/2 c  Oyster mushrooms
1 tb Extra virgin olive oil
2 tb Diced shallot
1 tb Chopped garlic
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/4 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
2 tb Finely chopped chives
Preparing the Gnocchi: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place rinsed
potatoes on a bed of rock salt and bake until dry and fluffy,
approximately 40 minutes. While hot, peel potatoes and run through a
food mill. Add eggs, seasonings, and flour, reserving 1/4 cup of
flour in which to roll the gnocchi. Roll into a smooth airy dough; do
not over-work it. Roll by hand into 1/2 inch cylinders. Cut into one
inch pieces on a floured surface and roll each piece over the back of
a fork to make shell - shaped gnocchi. Blanch in simmering, unsalted
water and cook for two minutes or until they float for 30 seconds.
Remove from water and reserve. Preparing the Wild Mushrooms and
Parmigiano: Clean and rinse all mushrooms and pat dry. Heat a heavy
saute pan with extra virgin olive oil and saute the mushrooms
vigorously at high heat. Add shallots and garlic; saute. Deglaze with
chicken stock, season, reduce and finish with Parmigiano and chives.
Garnish dish with shaved Parmigiano and chive sticks. Yield: 4
