Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Rhubarb*
1/4 c  Strawberry preserves**
1/4 c  Raisins
1/2 tb Orange zest,organic+
1 c  Granola++
Maple syrup to taste
Combine ingredients in a heatproof pan 13x8x2 inches. The combined
ingredients will seem dry; don't be concerned; the rhubarb will give
up considerable liquid as it cooks. Place pan in a cold oven, set
temperature to 375 F, and bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Stir and
continue baking until rhubarb is tender but still firm, about 10 to
15 minutes more. Add maple syrup to taste if more sweetness is
desired. *trimmed and cut into 1-inch slices **fruit-sweetened
+finely minced or grated if possible ++preferably maple walnut ~--
