Recipe by: McDougall Bring water and fruit to a boil. Slowly add
cereal to boiling water while stirring. Reduce heat to low, cook,
stirring frequently, 15 to 30 minutes. The longer the ingredients
cook, the softer they will be.

The porridge should be like a thick soup. Do not add milk at the
table.

HELPFUL HINTS: Most health food stores sell many kinds of whole grain
cereals. Follow directions on package, but increase the amount of
water by 1/2 cup for every two servings.

For added flavor, add a sprinkle of nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, or any
combination of these. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,
