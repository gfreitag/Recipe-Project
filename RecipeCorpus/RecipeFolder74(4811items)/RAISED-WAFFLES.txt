Title: RAISED WAFFLES
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Warm water
1 pk Dry yeast
2 c  Milk; warmed
1/2 c  Butter; melted
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
2 c  All-purpose flour
2    Eggs
1/4 ts Baking soda
USE A RATHER LARGE mixing bowl--the batter will rise to double its
original volume. Put the water in the mixing bowl and sprinkle in the
yeast. Let stand to dissolve for 5 minutes. Add the milk, butter,
salt, sugar and flour to the yeast mixture and beat until smooth and
blended. You can use a hand-rotary beater to get rid of the lumps.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand overnight at room
temperature. Just before cooking the waffles, beat in the eggs, add
the baking soda, and stir until well mixed. The batter will be very
thin. Pour about 1/2-to-3/4 cup batter into a very hot waffle iron.
Bake the waffles until they are golden and crisp. This batter will
keep well for several days in the refrigerator.
