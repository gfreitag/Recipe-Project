Directions: cream crisco, brown sugar, white sugar, 4 beaten eggs, and
vanilla together. In a seperate bowl, combine flour, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt. Mix dry ingedients to blend. Add, rice
krispies, rolled oats, coconut, pecans and chocolate chips.

Begin adding dry ingredients to creamed crisco mixture, this mixture
will get stiff, and unless you have dough hooks, it will become
necessary to mix by hand.If needed add a Tablespoon of water to
moisten just a bit After you have added all ingredients and they are
well blended. roll dough into small to med balls and place on cookie
sheet. Flatten dough with fork, and Bake at 325 F. for 8 to 10
minutes.

NOTE: this makes at least 8 doz. cookies. I have made the recipe and
refrigerated  dough during the holidays.( great for those of us who
like hot cookies and milk. I also have cut recipe in half and that
works well for me. This recipe is quite old and given to me by an
aunt of 76 years old. When she said by hand after working in some of
the dry ingredients she means BY  HAND, said get right in  there and
toss the dough around blending it well.
