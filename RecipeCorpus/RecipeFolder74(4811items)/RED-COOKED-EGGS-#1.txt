running water, and shell them.

sesame oil. Heat the mixture, stirring to dissolve the brown sugar.
Add the eggs. Simmer, covered for 1 hour. The liquid should cover the
eggs, but if it does not, baste frequently.

Turn off the heat and let the eggs stand in the another hour, turning

halves or quarters, with dipping sauce.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer
servings.
