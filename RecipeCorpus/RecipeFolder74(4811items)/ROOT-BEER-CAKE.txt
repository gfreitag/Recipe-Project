Categories: None
Yield: 1 Cake
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
pn Salt
1 c  Root beer (do not use diet)
3/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
4 oz Unsalted butter, softened
2 lg Eggs
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
6 tb Root beer
1 1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
2 oz Unsalted butter, softened
1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch springform pan.

2. For cake, sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set
aside. Put 1 cup root beer in a small saucepan; boil, uncovered,
until it is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Cool to lukewarm.

3. Beat brown sugar and butter in large bowl of an electric mixer on
high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one
at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stop the mixer and add
the reduced root beer and vanilla. Mix just to combine. Fold in the
dry ingredients with a rubber spatula.

4. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Poke
holes all over top with a toothpick. Brush with about 3 tablespoons
of the root beer. Remove the sides from the pan and cool cake
completely.

5. For frosting, mix remaining 3 tablespoons root beer, confectioners'
sugar, butter and vanilla in a small bowl to make a thin frosting.
Spread over top of cooled cake, letting it drip down the sides.
