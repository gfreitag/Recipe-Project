on. Peel the second orange and cut into 1/4" thick slices. Set the
slices aside for garnish. 3. Season the hens with salt and pepper.
Insert and orange quarter inside the cavity of each hen. (This keeps
the chicken moist.) Place the hens breast side up in a shallow
roasting pan. Bake for 1 hour, basting occasionally with the pan
drippings. If you see the hens getting too brown, turn them over -
breast side own to crisp the underside. 4. Remove the hens from the
oven and cover with the orange sauce. (This much may be done several
hours in advance, if desired.) 5. Lower the oven temperature to 350o
and return the hens to bake 15 to 20 minutes more. 6. To server,
slice each hen in half down the mid-line, remove the quartered
orange, and discard it. Garnish with an orange slice, and serve any
extra orange sauce alongside.
