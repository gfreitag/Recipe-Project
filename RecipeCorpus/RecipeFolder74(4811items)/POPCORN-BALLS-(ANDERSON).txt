Place sugar, corn syrup and vinegar in a heavy saucepan.

Insert candy thermometer and heat and stir over moderately high heat
until sugar dissolves.

Cook, uncovered, without stirring to 260'F. or until a drop of syrup
forms a hard ball in cold water.

Remove from the heat, mix in butter and vanilla. Pour over popcorn in
a large bowl and stir quickly so all pieces are coated.

With buttered hands, scoop up and shape into large or small balls.

Cool on waved paper or plastic food wrap. Serves 8.
