Title: ROY ROGERS CHICKEN & DUMPLINGS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 lb Chicken
Water to cover
1/2    Onion
Salt and pepper to taste
Garlic powder
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Vegetable shortening
2/3 c  Milk (up to 3/4 cup)
Place chicken in a large pot and almost cover with water. Add onion
half, salt and pepper and garlic powder. Bring to boil, reduce heat
to simmer and cook, covered for 50 minutes, or until chicken tests
done. Remove from heat and pull chicken from pot. When cool enough to
handle, remove skin and discard. Remove meat and pull into serving
pieces. Discard chicken bones and onion from pot.  Skim fat from the
top of stock.

Return chicken pieces to the pot of stock.

Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder and
salt.
Cut in shortening, and enough milk so that batter is smooth but not
too runny.  Bring pot of chicken and stock to a simmer, then drop
batter by spoonfuls into the hot liquid. Let cook 5 minutes,
uncovered, then cover the pot and cook another 5-7 minutes, or until
dumplings test done. Serve broth, chicken and dumplings in soup bowls
and season to taste.
