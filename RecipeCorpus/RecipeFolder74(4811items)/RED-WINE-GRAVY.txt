If making stock from the turkey giblets, place the giblets in a large
saucepan with 2 pints water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and
simmer for 30 minutes or until the liquid is reduced to 1 1/2 pints.
Strain and discard the giblets. After removing the turkey from the
roasting tin, skim off any excess fat from the juices. Place the
roasting tin on the hob and heat until the juices are sizzling.
Sprinkle over the plain flour and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and slowly add the stock, red wine,
redcurrant jelly and season to taste. Return to the heat and simmer
gently, stirring constantly until thickened. Pour into a warmed gravy
boat and serve.
