Stephen Ceideburg
2 c  Good olive oil
1 tb Black peppercorns
3    Fresh bay leaves
3    Dry chiles (i.e. japones),
-including seeds
3    Branches fresh thyme
Bottles of olive oil containing red chiles, black pepper- corns and
the wild herbs of the region sit on the table of every pizzeria in
Provence. When the thin crusted pizzas come hot to the table, the
first thing to do is sprinkle the hot pepper oil on them.

Pour the olive oil into a clean, dry wine bottle, then add remaining
ingredients. Cut 1/4-inch deep, V-shaped channel the length of a wine
cork and use it to cork the bottle.

Let stand in a cool, dark place for 2 to 3 weeks to let the oil become
infused with the flavors. Stored in a cool, dark place the oil will
keep several months.

Uses: This is wonderful sprinkled on almost any pizza, from
traditional ones such as quatre fromage or nouveau types such as goat
cheese with scallops.

Makes 2 cups.
