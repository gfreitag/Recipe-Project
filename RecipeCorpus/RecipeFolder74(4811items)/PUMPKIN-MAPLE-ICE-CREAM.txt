Yield: 1 Quart
2 c  Halfandhalf
2/3 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Pure maple syrup
1 ts Cinnamon
6    Egg yolks
2/3 c  Canned solidpack pumpkin
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
2 ts Maple flavoring
Place the halfandhalf in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer.
Whisk together the sugar, maple syrup, cinnamon and egg yolks.
Gradually add the halfandhalf to the egg yolk mixture, whisking
constantly. Return the mixture to the saucepan and place over
mediumlow heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until
the mixture thickens and leaves a path on the back of the spoon when
a finger is drawn across it; about 5 minutes. Do not allow the
mixture to boil. Pour the custard through a sieve into a medium bowl.
Stir in the pumpkin, vanilla extract and maple flavoring. Refrigerate
until cold. Transfer the custard to an ice cream maker and process
according to manufacturers' instructions. Transfer the ice cream to a
container, cover and freeze to firm it up a bit, about 2 hours.
