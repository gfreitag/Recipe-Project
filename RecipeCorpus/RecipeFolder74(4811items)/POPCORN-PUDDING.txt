Title: POPCORN PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Popped corn
3 c  Milk
4 tb Butter, melted
3    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Salt
Serves 4 to 6

Grind all but a small handful of the popped corn in a food processor
or grinder.  Scald the milk, pour it over the corn, stir in the
butter, and let the popcorn sit, covered, for 1 hour to absorb the
liquid.

Beat eggs with the sugar until light, add vanilla and salt, beat in
the corn mixture, and turn into a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle the
reserved popcorn on top. Bake at 300 F until custard is set and
browned on top, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Sprinkle the reserved whole
popcorn on top.
