Title: PUMPKIN PIE BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 72 Servings
3 1/2 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Pumpkin pie spice
1/2 c  Canned pumpkin
2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
(NOTE: use egg substitute or
-4 egg whites)
1 tb Vanilla
2 tb Butter or margarine (*NOTE)
1 1/4 c  Macadamia nuts, coarsely
-chopped (*NOTE)
Combine first 5 ingredients in a large bowl; stir well. Combine
pumpkin, eggs and vanilla; stirring well with a wire whisk. Slowly
add pumpkin mixture to flour mixture, stirring until dry ingredients
are moistened. (Mixture will be very crumbly; it will gradually
become moist after stirring.)

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add macadamia nuts.
Cook, stirring constantly, until nuts are browned. Remove from heat,
and cool completely. Knead or gently stir cooled nuts into dough.

*NOTE: I never use nuts in my biscotti in order to lower the fat
content and personally don't miss them at all. I will simply omit the
nuts, thereby also leaving out the butter. If you want to use the
nuts, cut the amount of nuts and butter in half.

Place dough on a lightly floured surface, and divide into 4 portions.
Lightly flour hands, and shape each portion into a 1" x 15" slightly
flattened log. Place logs 3" apart on lightly greased large cookie
sheets.

Bake at 350ø for 23 minutes; cool logs 15 minutes. Reduce oven
temperature to 300ø.

Cut each log crosswise into 1/2" slices, using a serrated knife. Place
slices on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 300ø for 15 minutes. Cool
completely on wire racks.

NOTES : This twice-baked cookie with staying power makes enough
extras to package and send as gifts.  Very good!!
