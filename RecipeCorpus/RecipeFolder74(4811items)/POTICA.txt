Title: POTICA
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Milk; hot
2 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  -warm water (105 F)
2    Eggs
4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour; unsifted
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3    Eggs
4 c  Walnuts, finely chopped
1 c  Light brown sugar, packed
2 tb Butter
1/3 c  Butter or margarine; melted
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla
Stir sugar, salt and butter into hot milk; cool to lukewarm. (A drop
sprinkled on wrist will not feel hot.) Sprinkle yeast over warm water
in large bowl; stir to dissolve. Stir in lukewarm milk mixture. Add 2
eggs and 2 1/2 cups flour; beat at high speed with electric mixer.
With a wooden spoon gradually beat in remaining 2 cups flour. Knead
with hand until dough is stiff enough to leave side of bowl. Place
dough in lightly greased large bowl.  Turn the dough over to bring up
greased side. Cover with a towel; let rise in warm place (85 F), free
from drafts, until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Make filling in
medium bowl.

Beat eggs slightly; add nuts, brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, cinnamon
and vanilla.  Stir filling to blend well. Shape dough; punch down
dough. On lightly floured surface turn out dough; cover with bowl and
allow to rest for 10 minutes.   Roll out to a rectangle 30 inches
long by 20 inches wide. Spread with filling, to 1 inch from the edge.
Starting from wide side, roll up tightly, as for jelly roll.  With
palms of hands, roll back and forth so that roll is even all over. On
large greased cookie sheet, form roll into a large coil, seam side
down. Let rise in warm place (85 F), covered with towel, free from
drafts, until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 F and
brush the roll with the melted butter. Bake 35 to 40 minutes until
golden. Cool on wire rack. Slice crosswise 1/4 inch thick. Makes a 4
pound loaf.
