28 oz -Can whole peeled tomatoes
1/2 lb Rigatoni
-=OR=- other tubular pasta
2 lg Swiss Chard leaves
- (red or green)

1/2 ts Ground black pepper
PLACE BEANS IN A POT with enough water to barely cover, cover the pot
and cook over low heat until beans are barely soft, about 2 hours.
Add water to keep the beans just covered as necessary. When beans are
done, remove from heat, drain and set aside. Meanwhile, cut the stems
out of fresh tomatoes and plunge them into boiling water for barely 1
minute, or until skins crack. Remove from water, peel the tomatoes,
cut them in half crosswise and squeeze out the seeds. If using canned
whole tomatoes, cut them in half and squeeze out seeds. Cut each
tomato half in quarters and set aside. Cook pasta until barely soft
according to the manufacturer's directions. Drain and mix with the
beans. Lay the chard leaves on a work surface and cut out the center
stem. Roughly chop the leaves and thinly slice the stems. Set aside.
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine oil and sausages in a Dutch oven, place
over medium heat and cook 3 minutes. Pour off the fat, add the garlic
and cook, stirring, another minute. Add the tomatoes, beans and
pasta, wine, oregano, chard stems, salt and pepper. Cover and place
in the oven for 20 minutes. When it's time to get dinner on the
table, add chopped chard to the casserole. If the casserole appears
dry, add up to 1 cup water. Replace in the oven for 5 minutes. Serve
piping hot from the oven and offer grated cheese.
