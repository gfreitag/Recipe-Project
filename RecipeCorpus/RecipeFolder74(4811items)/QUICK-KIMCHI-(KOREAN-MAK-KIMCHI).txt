Categories: Korean, Vegetarian, Condiment
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 lb Chinese turnip
1 1/2 lb Chinese cabbage
1 c  Water
1/4 c  Salt
4 lg Scallions
4 lg Cloves Garlic or 6 sm clove
2 tb Chopped fresh ginger
7 ts Cayenne pepper
1.  Wash the leaves of a Chinese cabbage and cut them into 2-inch
lengths (the leafy end may be left longer; it will shrivel the most).
Peel the Chinese turnip, halve it lengthwise down the center and then
slice thin across the grain.

2.  Combine the salt and water. Place the vegetables in a large pot.
Pour the salted water over the surface of the vegetables and cover
the pot. Leave overnight.

3.  The next day, mince the scallions, garlic and ginger. Drain the
vegetables, which should be wilted and reserve the salty water.
Season with the cayenne, scallion, garlic and ginger. Mix the
vegetables by hand, using rubber gloves if available. Pack this
mixture tightly into jars. Pour the salted water over the mixture so
that the liquid comes to within 1/2 inch of the top of the jar.

4.  Keep at room temperature for 2 or 3 days, then refrigerate.

Makes about 2 jars of kimchi which should be enough for a large dinner
party.
