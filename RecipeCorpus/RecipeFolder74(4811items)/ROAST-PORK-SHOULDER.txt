Title: ROAST PORK SHOULDER
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 2 Servings
2 1/2 lb Fresh picnic shoulder
-(with bone)
Provides cooked pork for 3 meals

1. Place picnic shoulder on rack in shallow roasting pan.
If meat thermometer is used, insert it in center of roast so tip
does not touch bone or fat.

2. Roast, uncovered, at 325øF (slow oven) until done, about 2-1/2 to 3
hours. To test for doneness, make a small cut next to bone into
thicker part of meat.
Juices will be clear when meat is done. Meat thermometer, if used,
should read 170øF.

3. Remove fat from drippings. Defatted drippings will measure about 2
tablespoons; save half for Roast Pork with Gravy (p. 46) and half for
Pork and Cabbage soup (p. 58).

4. Separate meat from rind, fat, and bone. Using the smaller pieces of
pork, dice and save 1 cup of meat for Pork and Cabbage Soup. Slice
remaining meat. Save half for sandwiches and half for Roast Pork with
Gravy.
Cooked pork will keep 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.
