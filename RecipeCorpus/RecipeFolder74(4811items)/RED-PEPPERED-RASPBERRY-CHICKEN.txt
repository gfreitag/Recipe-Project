Categories: Poultry, Finalist
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lg Legs, chicken, whole
-- (thigh/drumstick)
-- skinned, fat trimmed
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Butter, melted (opt)
1 c  Jam, raspberry, red,

1/3 c  Vinegar, balsamic
2 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Pepper, red, flakes,

Put the chicken in a large shallow baking pan. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper, then drizzle the melted butter over chicken (this
step is optional if you want to lower the fat content of the meal).

Bake, basting occasionally, in a 375 F oven for about 45 minutes
or until the chicken is brown.  Drain off the excess fat.

In a small saucepan, mix together the jam, vinegar, soy sauce,
and red pepper flakes.  Cook stirring over medium heat until smooth.

Spoon the sauce over the chicken, bake, basting, for 5 minutes
more or until the chicken is glazed and fork tender.

Arrange chicken on a platter.  Garnish with parsley.

* To reduce fat, butter may be omitted.

** Red wine vinegar may be substituted.
