Title: QUICK OVERNIGHT STARTER
Categories: Sourdough, Lauri
Yield: 3 Servings
2 c  Warm water (105 F)
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 c  All-purpose flour
In a 4 to 6 cup plastic pitcher with a strainer in lid or in a large
bowl, combine all ingredients.  Beat with a wooden or plastic spoon.
Fermentation will dissolve small lumps. Cover pitcher with lid,
turning strainer in lid to pouring lip.  Cover bowl with a cloth. Set
in a warm place free from drafts (85 F). Let stand 6 hours or
overnight. Starter will ferment, increase in size, then become thin
and decrease to original size. TO USE: remove starter needed for
recipe. Refrigerate remaining starter in pitcher or in a plastic
container with a lid that has an air vent or hole in it. Label
container with contents. Replenish every 7 to 10 days by stirring in
equal amounts of water and all-purpose flour. After replenishing, let
stand at room temperature overnight.  Return to refrigerator. If a
clear liquid forms on top, stir back into starter. Makes about 3 1/2
cups. Variation: Use whole-wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour.
