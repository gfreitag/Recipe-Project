Title: ROASTED SPARE RIBS (PEI QUOT)
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
2    To 2-1/2 lbs. spare ribs
1 tb Black beans
2    Thin slices ginger root
1    Scallion
1 cl Garlic
4 tb Soy sauce
4 tb Honey
3 tb Hoisin sauce
1 tb Rice Wine
1 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Oil
PREPARATION:

Remove as much fat and gristle as you can from the meat and cut apart
into individual ribs.  Wash black beans and mash. Mince ginger root
and the scallion. Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Mix black beans,
ginger root, garlic.  Mix soy sauce, honey, hoisin sauce, and rice
wine.

COOKING:

Heat oil in a large deep skillet or wok, and add ginger root and the
scallion.  Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the ribs and stir-fry for 5
minutes. Add soy sauce mixture; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the
chicken broth. Stir ribs to coat them with the sauce and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring
the ribs every 5 or 6 minutes to coat them with the sauce.  Remove
the ribs from the skillet and spread in a large shallow roasting pan,
in one layer if possible. Roast in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes.
If ribs are not dry in 10 minutes, roast a little longer.  They may
also be barbecued on an outdoor grill instead of roasted in the oven.

NOTE: This sauce is quite spicy.  If you prefer a milder dish, omit
the hoisin sauce.
