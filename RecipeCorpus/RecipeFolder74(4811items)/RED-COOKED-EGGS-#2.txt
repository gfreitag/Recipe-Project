Place eggs in a medium saucepan; cover with cold water. Heat over
medium heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; simmer, uncovered, about
15 minutes. Remove from heat; run cold water into pan until cool. Let
eggs cool in cold water.  Drain.  Lightly tap shells all over with
back of spoon; do not crack so hard that shells actually come loose.

Return eggs to saucepan; add remaining ingredients. Add cold water to
cover egg; heat over medium heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low;
simmer, covered, about 1-1/2 hours.* Remove from heat. Let cool to
room temperature in cooking liquid.

Refrigerate eggs, in cooking liquid, until serving time**. At serving
time, drain eggs, discarding liquid; shell eggs and leave whole or
cut in half.

* Heat may be turned off at any time and cooking resumed later

** The longer the eggs soak, at least several hours, the better
flavor they will have.  They can be done several days in advance.
