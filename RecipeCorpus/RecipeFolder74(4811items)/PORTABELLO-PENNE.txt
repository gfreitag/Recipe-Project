Categories: Pasta, Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
6 md Onion, chopped
2 tb Butter
4 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
2 lb Portabello
6 tb Fresh flat-leaf parsley,
-chopped
1/2 c  Sun-dried tomatoes, not
-packed in oil
1 1/2 lb Pasta
8 oz Goat cheese, crumbled
3 tb Parmesan cheese, grated
Chop onions. In a large skillet, melt half of the butter and half of
the olive oil together. Add the onion, sugar and 2/3 of the salt and
cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until the onions are
well browned, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl.
Meanwhile, stem the mushrooms. Halve the caps and slice them
crosswise 1/4 inch thick. In the same skillet, melt the rest of the
butter in a quarter of the olive oil. Add the mushrooms and the rest
of the salt and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until
tender and browned, about 8 minutes. Add the reserved onions and the
parsley. Season with salt and pepper. In a large pot of boiling
salted water, add the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta (Penne
recommended), cook until al dente, about 13 minutes; reserve 1 1/2
cups of pasta water and drain the tomatoes and pasta. In a large
bowl, toss the pasta with 1 cup of the reserved pasta water, the
mushroom mixture, goat cheese, Parmesan, and the rest of the olive
oil. If the pasta seems dry, add more of the pasta water. Serve
immediately, passing additional grated Parmesan at the table.
