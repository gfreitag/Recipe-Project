1/2 c  WILTON glucose<now=1/4 c.>
2 tb Crisco (need the 3#can too)*
1 tb Glycerine***
1 lb More confectioners' sugar
3 c  *apricot glaze or other
BEFORE STARTING!: Prepare cake as below. *Sift 2 lbs p.sugar into a
large bowl w/round bottom; Make "well" in center of the sugar for wet
ingredients **Use only Knox brand, others are different! ***1 small
bottle of Country Kitchen glycerine= 1 tb. ****Dip spoon in boiling
water, then measure Crisco. *****The "x" is used for the database,
ignore. DIRECTIONS: 1. BEFORE YOU MIX INGRED.: Spray the table <where
dough will be rolled out> w/PAM & dust table/rolling pin <using a
sieve> w/cornstarch/conf.sugar mixture. 2. Prepare cake:
Bake cake & place on 2 STURDY! foil-wrapped card boards the size
of the cake. <Have fancy STURDY! tray ready that is 3-4" larger than
cake.> "Cur tains" break if c.board flexes!
A solid cake should be used, such as FRUIT, CARROT or POUND cake
should be used. Torte as usual. Set aside to cool several hours. I
have used reg. cake.
Fill in any holes or uneven places with butter- cream icing so
cake is nice & smooth. 3. With your hands, rub something sticky on
the cake <for rolled icing to stick to>. I use *apricot filling -the
kind baker's use. You can use piping gel for fake cakes. * Coat the
cake <just> before making the icing. You wouldn't want this to dry
over. 4. Put 1 rounded ts Knox Gelatin in a glass measuring cup; add
cold water to equal 1/4 cup. Stir until gelatin is dissolved.
