Categories: Mexican, Main dish, Poultry, Dkuhnen msn
Yield: 4 Servings
1    3lb fryer chicken, cut up
1/2 c  Vinegar
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 sm Onion, chopped
1 cl Garlic
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Dried oregano, crushed
1/2 ts Salt
2 sl Bacon, cut up
8 oz Can tomatoes, choped
1    Carrot, chopped (1/2 cup)
1 c  Dry red wine
In a deep bowl, place the chicken, vinegar, oil, onion, garlic, bay
leaf, oregano, salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper. Allow this mixture to
marinate in the fridge for about 8 hours, or overnight. Fry the bacon
in a frying pan until crisp, then remove bacon, but reserve the fat.
Allow bacon to sit on some paper towel, to soak up the fat. In the
bacon grease, brown the pieces of chicken for about 15 minutes or
until well browned. Take the bay leaf and clove of garlic out of the
marinade, then pour the liquid over the chicken in the skillet. Add
the tomatoes in their liquid, the carrots and the red wine.  Cook for
35-40 mins., covered and on a low heat. Remove the chicken to a
warmed serving platter, add the bacon to the sauce in the pan and
season the sauce to taste, with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over the
chicken. Source:  Adapted by Deborah Kuhnen from "Better Homes and
