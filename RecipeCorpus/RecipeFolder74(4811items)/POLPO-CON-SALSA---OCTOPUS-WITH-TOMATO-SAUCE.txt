Categories: Seafood, Italian, Sauces, Salsa
Yield: 6 Servings
800    Gm octopus
2    Cloves garlic
4 tb Olive oil
125 ml Dry sherry
1 lg Can Italian peeled tomatoes
salt and pepper to taste

This ultra-simple Italian recipe can be served over rice or pasta.
Any size of octopus will do.

Clean 600-800 g octopus and cut it into chunks. Keep the ink sac if
you want to add the ink to the sauce for a richer flavour. Brown 2
cloves of finely chopped garlic in 4 tablespoons of olive oil, then
add the octopus. Cover and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes. Add
125 mL dry sherry and the contents of a large can of Italian peeled
tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes, add the contents of the ink sac if
using and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook gently for about
an hour, or until tender, stirring from time to time.
