Title: PUMPKIN MERINGUE PIE
Categories: Desserts, Pies, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Pumpkin; Canned, Mashed
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon; Ground
1/4 ts Nutmeg; Ground
1/4 ts Cloves; Ground
1/2 ts Salt
3 ea Eggs; Lg, Separated
1 c  Evaporated Milk
1 ea Unbaked 9-inch Pie Shell
1/8 ts Salt
6 tb Sugar
Combine the pumpkin, the 1/2 cup sugar, spices, and 1/2 ts of salt in
a bowl and mix well.  Add the egg yolks, stirring until well blended,
then, gradually, blend in the evaporated milk. Pour into the unbaked
pie shell. Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F. oven for 35 minutes or
until a knife inserted halfway between the center and edge comes out
clean. Remove the pie from the oven and increase the oven temperature
to 425 degrees F. To make the meringue, beat the egg whites and the
1/8ts of salt in a bowl, using an electric mixer set on high, until
foamy. Gradually add the 6 tbls of sugar, 1 tbls at a time, beating
well after each addition. Continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks
from when the beaters are slowly lifted. Spoon some of the meringue
around the edge of the warm pie. Spread the meringue so that it
touches the inner edge of the crust all the way around the pie, using
the back of a spoon to do this. Heap the remaining meringue in the
center and, again using the back of the spoon, push it out to meet
with the meringue border. Using a flatware knife, form light small
peaks in the meringue and then bake in the preheated oven for 5
minutes or until the meringue is lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
