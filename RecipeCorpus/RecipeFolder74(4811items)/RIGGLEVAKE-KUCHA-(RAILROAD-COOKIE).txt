Title: RIGGLEVAKE KUCHA (RAILROAD COOKIE)
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM-------------------------LIGHT PART------------------------------
4 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Milk
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Vanilla
Flour: enough to make dough
-easy to handle
MMMMM-------------------------DARK PART------------------------------
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Water
2 ts Soda
1/2 ts Vanilla
Flour: enough to make dough
-easy to handle
Mix the light and dark parts in separate bowls. Blend the sugar and
butter for both parts.

For the light part, beat in the egg then alternately add the milk,
vanilla and baking powder sifted with flour.

For the dark part add to the butter-sugar mixture the molasses, water
and vanilla alternately with enough flour.

Break off pieces of dough from both dark and light parts, shape them
into rounds and roll them separately about 1/8 inch thick. Put one on
top of the other, roll up like a jelly roll and slice off the pieces
as thinly as you can. Place on greased cookie sheets and bake at
350'F until done.

This is a cookie with a "laminated dough structure," that is, one
part is crispy and the other part is chewy. It results from
differential sugar crystallization. Ordinary sugar is readily
crystallizable and produces the crisp part of the cookie (the light
part). Molasses contains invert sugar and is crystallization
resistant; it produces the crispy, dark part of the cookie.
