1/3 lb Bacon ;diced
1 c  Yellow onion ;peeled, thinly

4    Scallions ;chopped
1/4 c  Mayonaise
1/2 ts Dry mustard (Coleman's)
1 tb White wine vinegar
1/2 c  Olive oil

2    Eggs ;hard boiled
Wash the potatoes and drain.  Using a paring knife, trim a band of
the peel about 1/2 inch wide (depending on the size of the potatoes)
around the circumference of each potato. This will form an attractive
"belt". Boil the trimmed potatoes gently in ample, lightly salted
water until just tender. The potatoes are done as soon as they pierce
easily with a sharp knife. Carefully drain, spread on a tray, and
allow to cool. Cook the bacon in a medium sized frying pan until
almost crip. Add the onion and cook until limp. Drain off any excess
fat. Place the cooled potatoes in a bolw along with the cooked bacon
and onion, and the scallions. In another bowl, blend together the
mayonnaise, dry mustard, vinegar, oil and salt and pepper to taste
add to the bowl of potatoes and toss together. Fold in the
hard-boiled eggs. Cover and refrigerate. Serves 4 to 6.
