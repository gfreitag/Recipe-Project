++++++++++++++ ++++ In a skillet brown the ground beef and then drain
off the excess fat. Add the bbq sauce, onion and brown sugar and set
aside. Separate the biscuit dough into 12 pieces and place one in
each of 12 ungreased muffin cups, pressing the dough up the sides to
the edge of the cup. Spoon the mixture into the cups and sprinkle
with the shredded Cheddar Cheese. Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F.
oven for 12 minutes. Serve hot. VARIATIONS: Use 1 13-oz can of chili
beans in place of the meat mixture (or 1 13-oz can of baked beans,
and frankfurters or hot dogs that have been cut into pieces) in place
of the meat mixture. You can also add green bell pepper or a hot
pepper to the above recipe with good results.
