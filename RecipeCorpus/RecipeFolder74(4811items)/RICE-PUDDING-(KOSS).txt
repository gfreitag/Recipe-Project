Title: RICE PUDDING (KOSS)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  White rice
6 c  Skim milk (soy should work
Just fine)
3/4 c  Sugar
1 pn Salt
1 tb Vanilla
Mix everything except the vanilla in a (non-stick!) pot. Heat until
just short of boiling, stirring constantly. Reduce heat, cover, and
simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

When it's the consistency that you like, remove from heat and add the
vanilla.

Pour into bowls and let cool or eat it hot like I do.

As an aside, I've been cutting back on simple sugars so I leave out
the sugar and add Equal to the bowls after it cools a bit.
