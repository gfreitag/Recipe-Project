Makes 12 standard muffins Note; I have made these using no sugar and
low-fat margarine, and do not notice much difference in the quality.
Preheat oven to 400Ã¸F. Butter standard muffin tins. In a large bowl,
stir and toss together the flour, potato starch, sugar (if used),
baking powder, salt and tyme.  Set aside. In a medium bowl whisk
together the milk and mashed potatoes, then add the egg, melter
butter (or margarine) and cheese, and whisk until well mixed. Add to
the combined dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon into
the prepared muffin tins, filling each cup about 3/4 full. Bake until
a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to
18 minutes. Cool in the tins for 3 minutes, then remove. Source:
