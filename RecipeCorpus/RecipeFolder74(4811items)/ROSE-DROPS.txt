Categories: Candies, Flowers
Yield: 1 Servings
Sugar; coarsely sifted
Rose water
3 dr Prepared cochineal
-(food coloring? -K.M.)
Mix some sugar to a stiff paste with rose water; add a few drops of
prepared cochineal to give it a pink tinge. Put part of the paste in a
pastille sugar boiler, and stir it over the fire until it boils, then
hold the sugar boiler in the left hand, inclining it over a baking
sheet, and, with a wire held in the right hand, cut off the drops as
then fall from the spout, they wil then fall in even-sized drops on
to the baking sheet. Put the drops to dry in the hot-closet for
twenty minutes, and put them on a sieve to cool.
