Title: RED PEPPER SAUCE
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
6    Red peppers
1/2    Bulb of garlic
x  Basil
It was really very simple. I cut about 6 red peppers in strips and
placed them on a cookie sheet. I placed about 1/2 bulb of garlic
(don't peel the cloves) in some foil and put all of this in the oven
on 425 for about a half hour. (The tips of the peppers were just
starting to look charred, so I took them out.) I let them cool for a
while then tossed peppers and garlic into the food processor with a
little basil and zapped. (Be sure to peel the garlic before zapping.)

This mixture adds a lot of flavor to an ordinary tomato sauce or it
can be used by itself. Yum!
