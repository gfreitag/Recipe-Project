the red and green peppers and saute another 5 minutes. Then add the
yellow squash, zucchini, and cabbage, and cook another
10    minutes.

4.  Remove the skillet from the heat.  Add the spinach, oregano, salt,
pepper, tomatoes, and kidney beans.

5.  Cut the crusts off the bread and lightly toast the slices.

6.  Spread half the vegetable mixture in the bottom of a large
ovenproof cassarole.  Layer the toast next, and then top with the
remaining vegetable mixture.

7.  In a small skillet, heat the remaining 2 T. olive oil. Add the
garlic and saute until lightly browned. Spoon the garlic over the
vegetables.

8.  Add the reserved stock to the cassarole, and sprinkle with the
Parmesan cheese.  Bake for 40 minutes. Serve piping hot. Source: "The
