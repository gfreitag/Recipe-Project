Title: PORK CHOP BRAISED IN MADEIRA & CIDER
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
Flour; for dredging
1    8 oz bone-in loin pork chop
2 ts Vegetable oil
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 ts Vegetable oil
1 sm Granny Smith; sliced
- or other tart apple
1 sm Onion; peeled and sliced
2 c  Coarsely shredded cabbage
1/3 c  Madeira
1/2 c  Apple cider
2 tb Sour cream (optional)
DREDGE THE PORK CHOP IN FLOUR, patting to remove any excess flour. In
a small deep saute pan with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over
medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the pork chop and
saute it until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove the
chop to a plate and season it with salt and pepper. Discard the oil,
add 2 more teaspoons of oil and heat until hot. Add the apple slices,
onion and cabbage and saute them until they start to wilt, 1 to 2
minutes. Pour in the Madeira and cider. Bring the mixture to a boil
and scrape up any browned cooking bits. Reduce the heat so the liquid
just simmers. Add the pork, cover the pan and let the dish cook until
the pork is tender, 40 to 60 minutes. Stir in the optional sour
cream, if desired, season with salt and pepper and serve.
