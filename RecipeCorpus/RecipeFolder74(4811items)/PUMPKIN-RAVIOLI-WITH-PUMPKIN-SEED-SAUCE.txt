14 oz Chicken broth
1/2 c  Whipping cream

Mix cheese, pumpkin, 1/2 tsp salt and the nutmeg; reserve.

Mix flour and 1/2 tsp salt in large bowl; make well in centre. Beat
tomato paste, oil and eggs until well blended; pour into well. Stir
with fork, gradually bringing flour mixture into centre, until dough
forms a ball. If dough is too dry, mix in up to 2 Tbsp water. Knead
on lightly floured cloth-covered surface, adding flour if dough is
sticky, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Cover, let rest 5
minutes.

Divide dough into 4 equal parts.  Roll dough, one part at a time, into
rectangle, about 12 x 10 inches(keep remaining dough covered). Drop
pumpkin mixture by 2 level teaspoonfuls onto half of the rectangle
about 1 1/2 inches apart in 2 rows of 4 mounds each.  Moisten edges
of dough and dough between rows of pumpkin mixture with water. Fold
other half of dough up over pumpkin mixture, pressing dough down and
around mixture. Trim edges with pastry wheel or knife.  Cut between
rows of filling to make ravioli; press edges with fork to seal.
Repeat with remaining dough and pumpkin mixture.  Place ravioli on
towel; let stand, turning once, until dry, about 30 minutes.

Prepare Pumpkin Seed Sauce.  Heat until hot; keep warm. Cook ravioli
in 4 quarts boiling salted water (2 tsp salt) until tender, 10 to 15
minutes, drain carefully. Serve ravioli with sauce.
