2 tb Pinenuts
2    Baked potatoes
1/2 c  White sauce
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 c  Parmesan
1/4 c  Peas, cooked
1/4 c  Carrots, dice, cooked

1/2 c  Onion, chpd, cooked
1 sm Tomato, peeled, diced
Toast pine nuts in 350 Foven, 8-10 mins or until golden brown. Watch
them carefully as they burn easily. Set aside. Cut a thin slice from
the top of each potato. Remove pulp, being careful not to tear the
shells. Keep shells warm. Crumble potato pulp. Add white sauce, salt,
and Parmesan; mix thoroughly. Add all other vegs except tomatoes; mix
well. Add pine nuts; mix thoroughly. Heap into shells. Garnish with
diced toamto.

Note: You may vary the vegs according to what you have on hand. It is
best to have a colorful combo, all cooked just crisp-tender. You may
either heat the white sauce and vegs before adding to crumbled potato
pulp, or add them cold and put the stuffed potato in a 350 F oven,
10-15 mins before garnishing with tomato.
