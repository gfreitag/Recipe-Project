Categories: Side dish
Yield: 10 Servings
3 tb Olive oil
1 md Onion, cut into 1/4" dice
1 tb Finely chopped garlic
2 c  Long-grain rice
1 cn Peeled plum tomatoes,
-drained and crushed (28 oz)

-chicken broth
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper,
-to taste
10 oz Frozen green peas, defrosted
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped flat-leaf

Using vegetable broth makes this a perfect dish for vegetarians, but
defatted chicken broth lends great flavor to the rice too. If you use
frozen peas, don't cook them before adding to the rice. Let them
defrost at room temperatur. Or put the peas in a strainer and run
under hot water.

1. Place olive oil in a large, heavy pot over low heat. Add onion and
cook, stirring, until wilted, about 10-12 minutes. Add garlic and
cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more.

2. Add rice and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

3. Stir in tomatoes and add broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring
to a boil, stir, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, for
20 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed.

4. When rice is cooked, fold in peas and parsley. Serve hot.
