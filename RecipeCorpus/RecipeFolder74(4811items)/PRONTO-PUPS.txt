Title: PRONTO PUPS
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Buttermilk pancake mix
2 tb Self rising corn meal mix
1 tb Sugar
2/3 c  Water
Combine dry ingredients, add water and beat thoroughly. Dip hot dogs
in batter and quickly drop them in hot vegetable oil at 375 degrees.
Bake 3 minutes or until golden brown.  You should have enough batter
for 8, maybe 10 hot dogs.  Your hot dogs should be dry and at room
temperature before dipping.  Happy dipping! Randy Rigg
