Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 10 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Gingersnap cookie crumbs
6 oz Pecans, toasted
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Butter, melted
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
32 oz Cream cheese
1 2/3 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Pumpkin, canned
9 tb Heavy cream
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Allspice
4 lg Eggs
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 tb Caramel sauce
1 c  Sour cream
FOR CRUST: Preheat oven to 350F.

Finely grind cookies, pecans and sugar in processor. Add melted
butter and blend until combined. Press crust mixture onto bottom and
up sides of 9in. diameter springform pan with 2 3/4in sides.

FOR FILLING: Using electric mixer beat cream cheese and sugar until
light Transfer 3/4 c mixture to small bowl cover tightly and
refrigerate to use for topping. Add pumpkin, 4 Tbsp whipping cream,
cinnamon and allspice to cheese mixture and beat until well combined.
Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until combined. Pour filling into
crust (filling will almost fill pan) Bake until cheesecake puffs, top
browns and center moves only slightly when pan is shaken, about 1
hour 15 minutes. Transfer cake to rack and cool 10 minutes. Run small
knife around cake pan sides to loosen cake. Cool. Cover tightly and
refrigerate overnight.

TOPPING: Bring remaining 3/4c cream cheese mixture to room temp. Add
remaining 5 Tbsp. whipping cream and stir to combine. Press down
firmly on edges of cheesecake to even thickness. Pour cream cheese
mixture over cake, spreading evenly. Spoon caramel sauce in lines
over topping. Using tip of knife swirl caramel sauce into cream
cheese. Release sides of pan from cheesecake. Spoon sour cream into
pastry bag fitted with small star tip (do not stir before using) Pipe
decorative border around cheesecake and serve. I use the caramel
sauce with the squirt tip to make lines on top, then I pull a
toothpick up and down in the opposite direction to create a web
effect. I have never used the sour cream border and it still tastes
great!!
