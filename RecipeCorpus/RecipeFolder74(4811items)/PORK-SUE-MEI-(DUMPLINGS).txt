Title: PORK SUE-MEI (DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
1 lb Lean ground pork,
-finely chopped
2 tb Light soy sauce
2 tb Dry sherry
1 ts Freshly grated ginger
1/2 ts Ground white pepper
1 tb Sesame oil
1/2 ts MSG (optional)
Pinch of sugar
1 tb Chopped green onion
1    Egg white
1 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Salt
4 tb Medium chopped bamboo
-shoots
-or water chestnuts
-(optional)
2    Cloves garlic, crushed
MMMMM------------------------THE WRAPPER-----------------------------
1 pk Shu-mei skins
-or Gyoza skins, available
-at the supermarket
Mix all of the ingredients for the filling together, and mix them
well. Place about 3/4 tablespoon of filling in the center of each
noodle wrapper and bring up the corners so that you have a little
money bag.
Leave the top open so that you can see some of the meat. For fun you
might put 1 frozen green pea on the top of each for added color.

Steam in an oiled bamboo steamer for 15 minutes, on high heat.

NOTE:  You can also add a bit of shrimp to this dish.
It adds a great deal of flavor.  Try about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh
shrimp.
