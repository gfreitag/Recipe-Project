Title: ROASTED PUMPKIN SEEDS
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 1 Batch
1    Pumpkin
2 tb Vegetable oil
Salt to taste
Scoop out the seeds and pulp from a pumpkin, and separate the pulp
from the seeds, discarding the pulp.

Rinse the seeds in a large colander under cold running water,
removing any remaining clinging strings.  Seeds will feel slippery to
the touch under the water.

Dump seeds, a small amount at a time, into paper toweling and dry.
Spread onto a large baking sheet and allow to finish air-drying for
an hour or so. When seeds are dry, toss them with the vegetable oil
to coat well and sprinkle liberally with salt.  Spread into a thin
layer on the baking sheet and place in a 350 F oven for 30 minutes,
or until golden brown, stirring every few minutes to prevent burning.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.

(These little suckers taste so good that roasted seeds rarely are
allowed to cool much beyond just cool enough to touch before they get
scarfed.)
