Title: RHODE ISLAND JONNYCAKES
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Stone Ground White Cornmeal
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 c  Boiling Water
1/4 c  Bacon Fat
1/2 c  Milk
Combine the cornmeal, salt and sugar in a heatproof bowl. Stir in the
boiling water,  1/4  cup at a time, until the mixture is thick and
pasty. Let stand until it "swells" (1-2 minutes). Heat the bacon fat
in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Stir enough milk into
the cornmeal mixture to form a batter which looks like slightly
mashed potatoes (it should spread only slightly when dropped from a
spoon). Drop the batter by heaping serving spoon fulls (about 2
Tablespoons each) into the hot fat, pulling in the edges of the cakes
with a metal spatula to prevent spreading. The cakes should be about
1/4 " thick. Cook the cakes until they are brown and crusty (about 6
minutes per side). Drain the cakes on paper towels. Split each cake
and serve hot.
