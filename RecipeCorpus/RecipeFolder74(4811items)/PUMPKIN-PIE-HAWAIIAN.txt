In a saucepan mix gelatin, brown sugar, salt and spices. Stir in milk,
pumpkin and slightly beaten eggs yolks. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly until hot throughout and gelatin is dissolved (8
to 10 minutes). Set in cold water to cool until firm but not hard,
stirring occasionally. In large mixer bowl beat egg whites until
foamy; gradually beat in powdered sugar and beat until stiff peaks
form. Set aside. Without washing beaters, beat cooled pumpkin mixture
until smooth and fluffy. Gently fold into beaten whites.  Heap
lightly in pie shell. Refrigerate for 3 hours. Spread with
ginger-flavored Whipped Cream Topping before serving. WHIPPED CREAM
TOPPING -- In chilled bowl combine 1 cup (1/2 pint) whipping cream, 3
tablespoons C and H Powdered Sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla or spice
(ginger, cinnamon, etc.).  Beat until just stiff enough to hold its
shape. Spread in swirls over pie, or use as dessert topping. Keep
refrigerated until served. It will hold up for hours! Reprinted with
