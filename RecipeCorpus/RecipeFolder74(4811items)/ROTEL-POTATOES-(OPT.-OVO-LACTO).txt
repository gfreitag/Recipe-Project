Title: ROTEL POTATOES (OPT. OVO LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 2 Servings
1 cn (10 oz) diced Rotel
Tomatoes, with liquid
2    To 3 large potatoes
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
Eggbeaters equivalent of 4
E*gs
2    To 3 oz. lowfat or nonfat
Cheese
4    6 tortillas
Microwave or boil the potatoes until they are half-cooked; the flesh
should still be firm, and not crumbly. Let them cool until you can
comfortable handle them, and cut into bite-sized pieces. In a large
skillet, dump the can of Rotel tomatoes and moist of the juice, then
add potatoes. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until
most of the tomato liquid has been absorbed by the potatoes (this
takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, and is usually dependant on how
hungry you are).

Optional: If you want to add eggs at this point, make a crater in the
center of the pan and add eggs. Continue cooking over medium heat
until eggs are scrambled. When they are just about down, stir
thoroughly with the potato mixture.

Serve with cheese (optional), either alone, or wrapped in steamed
tortillas. With the eggs and cheese, this make a simple, spicy, and
very filling breakfast.

Other ideas I have yet to try: Stir in spinach, zucchini, mushrooms,
and or onions with the potatoes.
