Categories: Breads, Pies, Kooknet
Yield: 1 Pastry
1 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/4 ts Salt
6 tb Cold Butter; cut into small
-pieces
2 tb Vegetable Shortening; cut
-into small pieces
4 1/2 tb Ice Water
Place the flour, salt, butter and shortening in a large bowl. Rub the
flour and fat together until the fat is broken into pieces the size
of oatmeal flakes. Don't over-blend. Using a pastry knife, add the
ice water, a little at a time, mixing until it just starts to hold
together. Press the dough into a roughly shaped ball. Knead it
briefly into a fairly smooth ball, then sprinkle lightly with flour
and wrap in a sheet of waxed paper. Chill 1-2 hours in the
refrigerator. When ready to roll, sprinkle work surface and rolling
pin with flour and roll the pastry out into a circle 1/8" to 1/4"
thick.

Butter a 9" pie tin. Place the crust in the pan and press gently to
line the inside. Crimp edges. To partially bake the shell, line the
pastry with buttered, lightweight foil. Fill the center with dry
beans or rice. Bake in the middle level of a preheated 400Ã¸F for
about 8-9 minutes or until the pastry seems set. Remove foil and
beans, prick bottom of the pastry with a fork, and return to oven for
2-3 minutes.
