Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Rhubarb, washed, dried
3/4 c  Sugar
5 tb Orange juice, fresh
10    Graham crackers
2 tb Sugar
5 tb Butter, melted
1 tb Gelatin PLUS 2 tsp
1 c  Light cream
1 pt Strawberries
Servings:  6

Cut rhubarb stalks into 2" pieces, put in saucepan with 3/4 cup sugar
and 2 tbls orange juice, simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes or
until tender. While rhubarb is cooking, prepare crumb crush. Crush
graham crackers, mix in 2 Tbsp sugar and melted butter. Press into
bottom of 9-10" pie pan and chill. When rhubarb is nearly cooked,
place remaining orange juice in bowl, sprinkle gelatin over juice.
Let soak a few minutes. Turn cooked rhubarb into food processor and
puree. Return to saucepan and bring to simmer. Pour rhubarb over
gelatin and stir until gelatin is completely dissolved, let cool
slightly then mix in cream and turn into crust. Chill for several
hours or overnight. Before serving, hull and halve the strawberries
and arrange over the top of rhubarb.

Summer fruits, rose-pink and scarlet (the color that promises
resurrection after death), combine to make a fresh and piquant
pudding similar to a cheesecake.
