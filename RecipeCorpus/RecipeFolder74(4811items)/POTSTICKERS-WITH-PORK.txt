Title: POTSTICKERS WITH PORK
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Ground pork
2    Chopped green onions
1 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Rice wine or dry Sherry
1 ts Sesame oil
1/2    Clove Crushed garlic
1    Egg
1 tb Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Mix all ingredients together, by hand, in a large bowl. Fill wanton
wrappers with approx.  1-1 1/2 teaspoons filling and press firmly in
wanton press. (I don't have a wanton press and it turned out just
fine) Moisten edges for better adhering.  Saute in Peanut oil on
medium heat till bottoms are golden. Add enough chicken broth to
barely cover wontons. Cover and simmer approx.  8 minutes. Serve
immediately with some dipping sauce consisting of: 2 parts soy sauce,
1 part rice vinegar, a little grated ginger and some chopped green
onion. Et viola!
