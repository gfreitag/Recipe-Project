Title: POOR MAN'S FRUITCAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Water
2 c  Raisins
1 c  Shortening
2 c  Sugar
3 c  Flour
1 tb Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Cloves
1 c  Walnuts
Bring the water, raisins, shortening and sugar to a boil, then set
aside and let cool.  Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda and
spices and add to the raisin mixture. Dust the walnuts with flour to
prevent them sinking, then fold them in.

Line a ten-inch angel food cake pan with parchment, and grease and
butter the pan. Pour in the batter and bake at 325 F. for one hour.
It is suggested that you can add half a pound pound of candied fruit
to this for Christmas; as usual I would just add pineapple and
cherries.

My special notes say not to turn pan over but to lift it out of the
angel food cake pan and keep the cake upright.
