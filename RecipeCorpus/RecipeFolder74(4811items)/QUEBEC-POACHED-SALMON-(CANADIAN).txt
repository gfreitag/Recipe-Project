Spread the oil in a frypan or baking dish. Place the salmon steaks
next to one another, but not overlapping. Add the lemon juice and
peel, peppercorns, salt, onion and just enough hot water to cover the
fish. Cover and poach on top of the stove (if using frypan) over low
heat, for 10-12 minutes or in 325Ã¸F oven (in baking dish) for the
same length of time or until the salmon flakes. Allow the fish to
cool in the liquid. Drain well and remove the skin. Arrange on
platter, then cover completely with the following sauce. Serve with a
cucumber salad.

Sauce Verte: Chop the vegetables coarsely and put in blender with
lemon juice. Cover and blend until it turns into a sort of mush with
small bits of this and that in it. Add the mayonnaise and blend. If
you don't have a blender, chop the ingredients very finely and blend
them into the mayonnaise with the lemon juice, crushing them as much
as possible to give color to the sauce.
