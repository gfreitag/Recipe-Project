Title: RAS MALAI
Categories: Cheese, Vegetarian, Desserts, Indian
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Ricotta Cheese
2 qt Half and Half
2 c  Sugar
5    Cardamon pods
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Vanilla
Rose water; to taste (opt)
Mix 1 1/2 cups of sugar with the Ricotta cheese and bake it in a 400
F oven for about 75 minutes in a flat dish covered with aluminum
foil. The cheese should have hardened and turned a pale brown.

Thicken the half and half by simmering over low heat for a long time.
This is best done in a microwave; if a microwave is not available, do
it over low heat and stir frequently. Thicken until the volume drops
to around half of the original volume.

Add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cardamom pods, bay leaf, vanilla and
rose water (and any other flavoring that you may want) to the Half
and Half. Heat for a few minutes.

After the cheese has been baked, cut it into 1 inch squares and add
to the hot thickened half and half. Cool for a few hours in the
fridge.
