Title: ROAST TURKEY WITH GRAPES & PRUNES
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 12 Servings
Safflower oil -- to coat
Paper bag
10 lb Turkey, whole
6 c  Dry corn bread -- crumbled
2 ts Thyme
2 ts Sage
2 ts Minced parsley
1/4 c  Port
1/2 c  Prunes -- pitted & chopped
1/2 c  Green seedless grapes
1 c  Diced apples
1 c  Minced onion
2 ts Safflower oil
1/4    Stick unsalted butter
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil inside of a large,
unprinted paper grocery bag. Wash and pat turkey dry.

2. In a large bowl mix corn-bread crumbs with thyme, sage, and
parsley. Set aside.

3. In a saucepan over medium heat, simmer port, prunes, grapes, and
apples for 15 minutes. In a skillet over medium-high heat, saute
onion in oil until soft but not browned (8 to 10 minutes). Add fruit
mixture and sauteed onion to bread crumbs and mix well.

4. Stuff cavity of turkey with bread stuffing. Lace opening shut with
kitchen twine. Dot exterior of turkey with small pieces of butter.
Place turkey inside prepared sack, roll opening of sack to seal
tightly, and place sack in a large roasting pan. Place in oven and
roast for 21/2 to 3 hours. During the last 30 minutes, tear away top
of bag to let exterior brown. To test for doneness, pierce a leg with
the tip of a sharp knife. The juice should spurt out a clear yellow;
if it is pink, roast the bird for 10 to 15 minutes longer.

Note:  If you are concerned about chemicals in the paper of the bag,
you may want to line the bottom of the bag with aluminum foil or a
rack.
