Title: RED PEPPER SWORDFISH
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Swordfish steaks
-(each about 1/2 lb
-and about 1 inch thick)
1 lg Sweet red pepper
2    Lemons
3 tb Oregano, fresh
1 c  Olive oil
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper,
-fresh ground
White wine, dry
Remove seeds and ribs from pepper and cut into 1/4 inch cubes. Put in
a bowl and mix well with the juice of the two lemons, the olive oil,
salt, pepper and the oregano.

Heat broiler and pour wine to a depth of about 1/8 inch in a broiler
pan. Lay swordfish steaks in wine and broil for 3 minutes. Pour the
seasoned lemon, oil and oregano mixture over the fish and cook for 3
to 4 minutes more (until fish is cooked through and lightly browned.)
Immediately transfer fish to a warmed serving dish.

You may need to reduce the sauce slightly by boiling vigorously and
stirring for 2 minutes more. Pour sauce over fish and serve.

NOTES:

*  Swordfish steaks cooked with sweet red peppers -- This recipe was
handed out to people buying swordfish at my local fishmonger; I tried
it and it was delicious. It is also very quick and simple to make.

*  I served fresh asparagus with this, but any light vegetable would
be fine. Boiled new potatoes would be nice, too.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes.
