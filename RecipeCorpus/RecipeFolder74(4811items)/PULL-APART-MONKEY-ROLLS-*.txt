Add ingredients in order given by manufacturer. Select dough/manual
cycle. When cycle is complete, remove dough to lightly floured
surface. If needed, knead more flour into dough to make it easy to
handle. Divide dough into 20 equal portions. Form each piece into a
small ball. Sift together the sugar and cinnamon. Dip each ball into
melted butter then roll in the cinnamon sugar. Arrange half the balls
in the bottom of a greased 8 cup ring mold or fluted tube pan with

the second layer between the balls in the first layer. Drizzle balls
with any remaining butter and sprinkle with any remaining sugar
mixture. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft free place until almost
doubled in size, 20-30 minutes. Bake at 375~ for 25-30 minutes or
until done. Cool 1 minute on wire rack; invert onto serving platter.
