2    Pkgs. yeast
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Warm water
1 ts Salt
1 c  Sugar
2 oz Butter or margarine

let stand 5 minutes.  Beat eggs in large bowl. In small pan, combine
milk, salt, butter and sugar; stir over low heat until milk is warm
(butter may not be melted).  Gradually stir in egg, then beat in 3
cups flour; add yeast and heat until smooth. Gradually add enough
remaining flour to make dough; turn on  to lightly floured board and
knead 8 to 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, cover, let rise until

use cake pans for baking the bread.). Let rise until doubled or at
