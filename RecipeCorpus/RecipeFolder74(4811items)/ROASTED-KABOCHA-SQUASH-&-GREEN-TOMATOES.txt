Title: ROASTED KABOCHA SQUASH & GREEN TOMATOES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
1 md Kabocha squash; about 3 lb
2 lb Green tomatoes
1 1/2 lb Red onions
1 1/4 lb Red potatoes, small
6    Cloves garlic; up to 8
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Salt; or more
Peel the squash, seed it, and cut it in 3/4-inch cubes. The best
method to do this is to cut the squash in half with your biggest,
sharpest knife, and scoop out the seeds. Then lay the halves cut side
down and slice them in wide strips. Lay the strips on their sides and
cut off the thick, hard rind in pieces, then cube the orange flesh.
This method allows you to keep the cutting edge of your knife always
safely aimed down toward the board, very important when applying
pressure to a tough hide.

Cut the green tomatoes in 1-inch chuncks. Peel the red onions and cut
them in thin wedges. Scrub the potatoes and cut them in pieces no
larger than the squash pieces. Peel the garlic cloves and slice the
larger ones in half lengthwise.

Toss all the vegetables together with the olive oil and salt until
they are evenly coated, spread them on two baking sheets, and roast
them at 400 degrees for about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir and turn the
vegetables a couple times in the course of the cooking time. They
should be perfectly tender, with crisped, browned edges here and
there.

Serve the vegetables with Couscous with Moroccan Spices.
