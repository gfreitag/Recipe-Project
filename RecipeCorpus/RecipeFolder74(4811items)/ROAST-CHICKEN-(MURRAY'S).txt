Season chicken halves with garlic powder, pepper and "Lowry's"
seasoned salt. Place in a pre-heated oven at 350^ for 1/2 hour breast
side down.

Turn at 1/2 hour time and cook for another 1/2 hour at 375^. At the
one hour time mark turn the temperature up to 500^ for the last 15
minutes to brown, keep a close watch not to overbrown as different
ovens cook slightly differently! Serve 1/2 chicken per portion and
pour separated gravy* over chicken, enough to just cover inner circle
of plate..... DO NOT COVER AT ANY TIME !!!!!

* - Separated gravy is gravy that is allowed to cool and the fat that
rises to the top is taken off and then the remaining gravy is
reheated or the hot gravy is poured into a gravy seperator !!!
