This may take a couple posts. Now, don't preheat the oven. Put it in
oven fat side up and roast uncovered at 35o F but cover the stuffing
after 30 min with a bit of foil (Sausage-Corn Stuffing coming up
later). 3-4 lbs takes 2 -2 1/2 hrs, bone in and I'd insert a meat
thermometer 30 min before end of roasting (be sure the tip does not
touch the bone or sink into fat) and keep cooking till 165 F (72 C)--
test in several places to be sure.

Done? O.K. Make a tent of foil, take out of oven and let stand for
10- 15 min (Temp reads 170 F (75 C) after standing). Oh, if you
happen to run one 4-6 lbs (which I doubt as you are doing an intimate
dinner); go 2 3/4- 3 1/2 hrs. Make or buy a few little circles of
paper and snip vertical lines down the sides; place on the bone tips
for the "crown." Hey, you can propose on this one (but expect to do
plenty of cooking for her --VBG)!

Oh, carving: Remove any stuffing or veggies from center of roast and
carve down between the ribs to serve the chops. I know, obvious; but
I'm an obvious kind of gal. Need to know every little thing and I am
not insulting your intelligence; just doing what I'd want done for me.

Seasoning: When I say "seasonings,"  I would go with 2 tsp dried leaf
thyme, 1 tsp dry mustard, 1 tsp celery seed, and 1/4 tsp garlic
powder.

Alternative seasoning: 2 tsp Italian herb seasonings, 1/2 tsp garlic
salt, 1/4 tsp cracked pepper, 1/4 tsp ground lemon peel

Alternative seasoning: 1 tsp dried leaf sage, 1 tsp dried leaf
rosemary, 1 tsp dried marjoram, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion
salt

Note: you might also try 1 tsp of ground ginger added to alternative
# 1.
