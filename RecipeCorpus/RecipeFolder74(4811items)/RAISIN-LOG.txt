Title: RAISIN LOG
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Portion Four-Way Sweet Bread
-Dough
2 tb Canned milk
1 c  Golden or dark raisins
3 tb Vanilla sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Allspice
Topping:
3 ts Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Allspice
1 ts Cornstarch
* Use Grated Raw Potato Starter Roll the dough into a rectangle with
the width equal to the length of the pan (medium size loaf) and about
twice as long.  Brush with canned milk. Scatter raisins over surface.
Mix vanilla sugar, cinnamon and allspice together and sprinkle on
evenly. (if vanilla sugar is not available, dribble 1 tsp. of vanilla
extract over dough.) Roll up tightly but do not seal ends.  Place
seam-side down in pan. Butter top generously and push sharp pointed
knife down through the dough almost to bottom at regular intervals to
allow air bubbles between layers to escape. Set in warm place to rise
and when ready for the oven, spread with the well-mixed topping (the
cornstarch will help to bind the topping to the crust so that it will
not crack off badly when sliced). Bake in oven preheated to 350 for
50 to 60 minutes. Cool before slicing.
