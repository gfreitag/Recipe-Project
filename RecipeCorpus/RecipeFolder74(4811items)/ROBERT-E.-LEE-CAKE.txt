Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 8" cake
9    Eggs, separated, room temp
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Lemon juice
Grated peel of 3 lemons
Grated peel of 5 oranges
1/2 c  Lemon juice (3-4 lemons)
2 c  Orange juice (6-8 oranges)
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Shredded coconut
Preheat oven 350 degrees.  Spray 3 (8 inch) round cake pans with
vegetable cooking spray.  In large bowl, beat egg whites until they
hold stiff but moist peaks. In large bowl, beat egg yolks until lemon
colored and very light.  Slowly beat in 1 1/2 cups sugar. Fold in egg
whites. Gently fold in flour, salt and 1 tablespoon lemon juice,
mixing only enough to blend in flour.  Divide batter equally among
prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven 35-45 minutes or until a wooden
pick inserted into center comes out clean. In a medium size bowl,
combine citrus peels and juices, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and 1 cup of
coconut.  Stir mixture to dissolve sugar. Remove cake layers from
pans to trays.  Spoon citrus mixture over tops of warm layers; cool.
Stack layers on a serving plate. Let stand several hours before
serving to allow cake to absorb liquid.  To serve, sprinkle with
remaining 1/2 cup coconut.
