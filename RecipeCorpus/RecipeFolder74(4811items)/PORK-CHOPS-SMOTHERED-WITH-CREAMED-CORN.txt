Yield: 6 Servings

3    Or 4 pork chops about half
-an inch thick
17 oz Can of creamed corn
3    Or more green onions
2    Eggs, beaten
1 c  Bread crumbs
Salt
Pepper, freshly ground
Sweet paprika
Mince two of the green onions and mix into the creamed corn. Add the
eggs and bread crumbs and mix well. Add enough of the bread crumbs so
the mixture is on the stiff side. Salt the mix- ture to taste and add
the pepper--about three grinds from a big pepper mill or 1/4 to 1/2
teaspoon of already ground pepper and mix again.

Trim  fat off chops, if desired, and brown chops in skillet. The
skillet should be very hot and the chops seared on each side, but not
cooked through. Remove from heat and cover the chops with the corn
mixture. Pat it around and over the chops so that they are completely
covered. Sprinkle paprika and scatter the remain- ing minced green
onion evenly evenly over the top of the corn.

Put the whole shebang--skillet and all--into a pre-heated 325 degree
F. oven. Bake it for a half hour to 45 minutes. It should come out
with a nicely browned top and moist but done chops. Serve with a
veggie or salad on the side and, most of all, enjoy!
