onion in a little butter and mix with the prune mixture. Cut each
pork fillet in half lengthwise and spread lower halves with the prune
mixture. Cover with the top halves and tie with string. Dust fillets
with seasoned flour, adding extra seasoning if desired. Place in an
ovenproof dish, pour melted butter over, cover and cook for 40
minutes. Remove from oven and pour off liquid into a pan. Return
fillets to oven and cook, uncovered, for further 15 to 20 minutes to
brown. Blend the flour into the liquid, then add reserved prune
liquid and water or stock. Bring to boil, stirring; boil for 3
minutes. Stir in cream and brandy and heat through; do not boil.
Remove strings from fillets, place on a dish and pour the sauce over.
