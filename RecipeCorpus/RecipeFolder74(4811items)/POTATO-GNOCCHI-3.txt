Title: POTATO GNOCCHI 3
Categories: Italian, Side dish
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Boiling potatoes; -=OR=-
5 1/2 c  -Mashed potatoes
3/4 c  Flour (or more)
5    Egg yolks
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Salt; or as desired
White pepper; to taste
1/3 c  Olive oil
USING UNCOOKED POTATOES, boil them, unpeeled, in salted water until
soft. Or cook them in a microwave according to oven directions or
bake in a conventional oven. Drain boiled potatoes. Peel potatoes
when they are cool enough to handle and puree them through a food
mill or potato ricer while still warm. Do not use a blender or food
processor for this because it excites the gluten in the potato and
makes a sticky mess. If using leftover mashed potatoes, place in a
small pot and heat them until they are warm. Transfer potatoes to a
mixing bowl, add the yolks and mix. Add nutmeg, salt, pepper and 3/4
cup of flour. Knead together and add the remainder of the flour if
necessary, bit by bit, kneading until a slightly sticky consistency
is attained. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Form the dough
into sausage-like rolls about the thickness of your thumb. Cut into
pieces about 1-inch in length. Using a fork, flatten the pieces so
that the tines leave an imprint in the gnocchi. Keep a glass of water
nearby to clean the fork. Meanwhile, fill a 3-quart pot with salted
water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat so that the water is boiling
at a gentle roll. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water, about 16
at a time. They will sink to the bottom but will rise to the surface
after a minute or so. Continue to cook for another 15 seconds.
Immediately remove with a slotted spoon to a colander. Sprinkle with
a little olive oil, mix gently and transfer to a heated platter.
Continue until all the gnocchi are cooked. Serve the gnocchi
ungarnished as a side accompaniment to roast meat or poultry.
