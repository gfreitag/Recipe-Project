1/2 c  Sweet pickle juice
1/2 c  Diced red onion
1 c  Mayonnaise (can be light)

Paprika for garnishing salad
1. In a large saucepan cover the potato pieces with cold salted water
and set over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat
slightly and cook uncovered, stirring a few times, until the potatoes
are just tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a large
bowl. Pour the pickle juice over the hot potatoes, stir gently and
cool to room temperature. 2. Place the diced red onion in a small
bowl and cover with ice water. Let sit 20 minutes to reduce the
acidity. Drain and squeeze out the excess moisture with a paper
towel.  Add to the potatoes. 3. In a medium bowl stir together the
mayonnaise, sour cream, horseradish mustard, salt, pepper, pickles
and chives. Pour this mixture over the potatoes and toss gently. Add
the eggs and toss again.  Spoon into a serving container. The salad
can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Refrigerate, covered. 4. Sprinkle
salad with paprika at serving time.
