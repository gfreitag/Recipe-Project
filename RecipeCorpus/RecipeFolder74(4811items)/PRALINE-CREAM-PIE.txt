Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a 9-inch pie pan, combine the
crumbs, pralines and butter together until the mixture is bibded
together. Spread and press the mixture evenly on the bottom and sides
of the dish to make crust.  Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until it is
brown. Remove from oven and cool completely. For the filling: In a
non-reactive sauce pan, combine milk, sugar, vanilla, and syrup over
medium heat. Stir slowly to dissolve the sugar and  heat long enough
to scald the milk. Remove from the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine
egg yolks with the cornstarch and mix well. Add 1/4 cup of the milk
mixture at a time to the egg mixture, blending in between each
addition, until all is combined. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and
over medium heat, stir constantly for 1-2 minutes. Stir until smooth
and thick.  Remove from heat and put through a fine sieve to remove
any lumps. Chill the filling in an ice bath until cold. Fold in the
pralines and spread evenly into the pie crust. Refrigerate for 2
hours or until it sets. For the whipping cream: Using an electric
mixer, whip the cream, sugar ans syrup until stiff peaks form. Spread
the cream evenly of the top of the pie.  Slice a piece of the pie and
place on plate. Garnish with pralines, chocolate sauce, powdered
sugar and fresh mint sprigs.
