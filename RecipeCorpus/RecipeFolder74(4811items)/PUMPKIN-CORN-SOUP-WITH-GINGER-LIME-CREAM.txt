This simple recipe is easy to prepare and utilizes two very basic
ingredients in Southwestern cooking:  pumpkin and corn.  It is a
delicious, rich-bodied soup, and the Ginger Lime Cream adds a
refreshing zest. *****

In a medium covered pot, cook the corn kernels with a little water
until soft, about 10 minutes.  In a food processor, process the corn
until smooth and run through a sieve and discard the skins.

Combine the corn puree, garlic, salt, white pepper, and stock in a
saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat
to low, add the pumpkin, and cook 10 minutes while stirring.

In another saucepan cook the lime juice and ginger 2 minutes over
medium heat.  Remove from the heat and pour through a sieve to remove
the ginger. In a bowl, combine the ginger-lime juice, the lime zest
(save some for the garnish), and cream.  Whip until the mixture has
soft peaks.

Spoon a dollop of Ginger Lime cream onto each bowl filled with soup
and garnish with the remaining line zest.  Serve immediately.
