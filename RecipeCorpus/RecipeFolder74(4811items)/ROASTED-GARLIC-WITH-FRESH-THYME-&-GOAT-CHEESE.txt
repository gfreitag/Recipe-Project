Title: ROASTED GARLIC WITH FRESH THYME & GOAT CHEESE
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs, Ew
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Plump heads of garlic
3/4 c  Defatted reduced-sodium
Chicken stock
8    Sprigs, up to ...
10    Sprigs fresh thyme
Salt & freshly ground black
Pepper to taste
4 oz Log creamy goat cheese,
Cut into 4 portions
4 sl Lightly toasted sourdough or
Peasant bread
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  With a sharp knife, cut off and discard
the upper third of each garlic head, exposing the cloves. (Leave the
skin intact below the cut.) Set the garlic heads, cut-side up, in a
small baking dish or grating dish just large enough to hold them.
Pour chicken stock over the garlic, add thyme sprigs and season
lightly with salt and pepper. Cover the dish tightly with heavy-duty
aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour, or until each clove is soft to the
touch and the skin resembles lightly browned parchment. Serve the
garlic with the cooking juices spooned over and pass goat cheese and
bread separately. To eat, break off a piece of bread and spread with
a small amount of cheese, then scoop out the garlic puree from one of
the cloves with the tip of a knife and spread on top.
