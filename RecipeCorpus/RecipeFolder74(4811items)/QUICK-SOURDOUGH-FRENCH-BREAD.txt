Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
-JUDY LAUSCH DGSV34A
4 1/2 c  Bread flour
2 tb Wheat germ
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ginger
2 pk Fast-acting dry yeast
1 c  Warm water; (120-130*)
1 c  Sour cream; room temp.
2 tb Vinegar
1    Egg white
1 tb Water
2 ts Poppy seeds
1. In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 c flour, and next five ingredients
(wheat germ, sugar, salt, ginger and yeast); blend well. Add water,
sour cream and vinegar to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until
mositened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. Stir in an additional 2 to
2 1/2 c flour until dough pulls cleanly away from sides of bowl. 2.
On floured surface, knead in remaining 1/2 to 1 c flour until dough
is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl;
cover loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm
place until light and doubled in size, 25-35 minutes. 3. Grease large
cookie sheet. Punch down dough several times to remove all air
bubbles. Allow to rest on counter covered with inverted bowl for 15
minutes. Divide dough in half; roll each half to 14x8" rectangle.
Starting with longest side, roll up; pinch edges firmly to seal.
Place seam side down on greased cookie sheet; taper ends to a point.
With sharp knife, make five 1/4" deep diagonal slashes on top of each
loaf. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size,
about 15 minutes. 4. Heat oven to 375*F. Bake 25 minutes. In small
bowl, beat egg white and water. Remove bread from oven; brush with
egg white mixture. Sprinkle with poppy seed. Return to oven. Bake an
additional 5 to 10 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when lightly
tapped. Immediately remove from cookie sheet; cool on wire racks.
