Title: RASPBERRIES WITH PEACH PUREE
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 4 Servings
4 md Peaches; peeled & pits
-removed
2 tb Raspberry vinegar;up to 3 tb
2 tb Sugar, powdered; or to taste
2 c  Raspberries, fresh
1/2 c  Creme fraiche; up to 3/4
"To peel peaches, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Drop 1
peach at a time gently into the boiling water, leave it for 5
seconds, and retrieve it by piercing the flesh with a fork. With a
paring knife, slit the skin, which will then slip off easily." "This
puree can be made several hours ahead but should be stirred before
spooning onto the plates. The raspberry vinegar holds the color of
the peaches, add a subtle tang, and heightens the flavor of the
raspberries. Pears may be substituted for the peaches and can simply
be peeled without first being dipped into boiling water." Puree the
peaches in a food processor or a food mill fitted with the finest
disk. (There should be about 1 cup puree.) Add the raspberry vinegar
and enough of the powdered sugar to balance the taste. Refrigerate
until serving time. Divide the puree among 4 dessert plates, spooning
it into a semicircle. Nestle a quarter of the raspberries beside each
serving of puree and pass the creme fraiche separately.
