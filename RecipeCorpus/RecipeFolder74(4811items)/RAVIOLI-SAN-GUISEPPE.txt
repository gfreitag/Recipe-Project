Categories: Desserts
Yield: 20 Servings
FOR DOUGH
8 oz Plain flour, sifted
Pinch of salt
2 1/2 oz Caster sugar
4 1/2 oz Butter, diced
1    Egg
1/2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
FOR FILLING
3 fl Hot weak China tea
12 oz Caster sugar
6    No need to soak prunes
1 lb Apples
2 oz Pine nut kernels
Icing sugar to dust
TO SERVE
Whipped cream or vanilla
Ice cream.
To make the dough, put the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor
and, with the machine running at full speed, add the butter until
incorporated. Then add the egg and lemon zest and process for a few
seconds until a soft dough has formed. Scrape the dough onto a sheet
of clingfilm, then form into a cylinder and chill for at least 1
hour. To make the filling, sweeten the tea with 2 tspn sugar and soak
the prunes in it. Peel, core and slice the apples. Put the rest of
the sugar in a large pan with 2 tbsp water. Heat gently, stirring
occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Add the apple slices.
Increase the heat to medium and cook, without stirring, until the
apples are candied (approx. 20 mins). Most of the liquid will
evaporate leaving a thick syrup. Drain and chop the prunes and add to
the pan with the pine nut kernels. Remove from the heat, cool
slightly then transfer to a bowl and leave to cool. Preheat the oven
to 180'C (350'F). To assemble the ravioli, cut a slice off the end of
the dough cylinder and roll out on a floured surface. Use a 3 inch
cutter to cut out a neat circle. Repeat using the rest of the dough
to make approx. 20 circles. Place a small spoonful of the filling on
each circle. Brush the edges with a little water and fold over to
make a half circle. Crimp the edges to seal firmly. Place all the
ravioli on a greased baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes or until
light golden. Cool slightly and dust with icing sugar and serve with
cream or ice cream.
