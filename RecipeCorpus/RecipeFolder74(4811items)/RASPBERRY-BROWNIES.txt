Title: RASPBERRY BROWNIES
Categories: Brownies, Desserts
Yield: 20 Servings
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Unsalted butter*
12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate*
2 c  Sugar
4 lg Eggs
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 c  Raspberries, fresh or frozen
*FROSTING*
2 c  Cream
16 oz Semisweet chocolate*
4 tb Raspberry preserves*
*Cut butter into pieces.  Do not use chocolate chips. A really good
imported chocolate will make these extra special. For frosting use
seedless red raspberry preserves.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9"x12" pan with foil and spray
that with a nonstick spray. Sift flour, soda and salt into a bowl;
set aside. In a sauce pan on stove top *OR* in a non-metal bowl in
the Microwave oven melt the butter; remove and add chocolate. Let
stand 1 minute to soften chocolate then whisk it together until
smooth. Cool about 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar
and eggs; add chocolate mixture and wisk until blended. With a wooden
spoon, stir in flour mixture. Carefully fold in raspberries. Pour
into prepared pan and bake 25-30 minutes until a toothpick inserted
into the center comes out with a moist crumb. Cool. Frost.

FROSTING;  In a small saucepan on stove top *OR* in a non-metal bowl
in the microwave bring cream to a boil. Remove from heat and add
chocolate and preserves. Place over a bowl of cool water and stir
with spatula until soft peaks form.  Spread on cooled brownies and
serve.
