Title: RANGER COOKIES (CAMPBELL)
Categories: Desserts, Biscuits, Fruits
Yield: 8 Dozen
2 c  Margarine
2 c  White sugar
2 c  Brown sugar
5    Eggs
1 tb Vanilla
4 c  Coconut
2 c  Chopped dates
5 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
8 c  Uncrushed cornflakes
Mix all in order given.  Make sure everything is well combined before
cornflakes are added or they'll become too crushed.

Bake at 375F until BARELY browned.

Yield is approximate.  It depends on the size of the cookies you
make. (But if this is still at 2c margarine, then you're looking at a
LOT of cookies - we make this in a commercial kitchen and get 6 or 8
trays of 35 2" cookies.
