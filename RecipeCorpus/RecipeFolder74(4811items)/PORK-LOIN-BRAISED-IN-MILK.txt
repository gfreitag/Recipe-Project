Title: PORK LOIN BRAISED IN MILK
Categories: Meats, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
Pork loin roast
-(between 2-5 lb; you
-can also use a pork
-shoulder roast)
2 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
Salt
Black pepper,
-freshly ground
Milk to cover roast;
-see instructions
2 tb Water, warm
-(more as needed)
Find a saucepan that fits the pork roast closely, but still allows
you to turn the roast in it.  Add the butter and oil to the pan. Heat
at medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides.

Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add enough milk to cover 3/4 of the
meat. Cover the saucepan, but leave the lid ajar. Turn the heat down
to medium and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, until the sauce has
reduced to thick, nut-brown clusters. If the sauce has not reduced
after 2 1/2 hours, remove the meat, keep it warm, and increase the
heat to high until the sauce thickens.

Remove the roast from the sauce, if you haven't already. Turn the
heat down and skim the fat from the sauce. Add the water, turn the
heat to high, and scrape the bottom of the saucepan (there will be a
crust on the bottom that you'll want to get loose).

Return the meat to the pan, warm it up, and serve it with the sauce.

The cleanup for this recipe takes a while, because the saucepan gets a
crust on the bottom.
