Title: POTATO/CABBAGE BOX (QUICK LUNCH)
Categories: Digest, Sept., Quick
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2    Cabbage chopped coarsly
2 sm Potatoes
1    Dozen or more mushrooms
2 tb Minced chives
x  Salt
x  Black pepper
x  Paprika
Layer into lunch box in this order. Do not mix. Mix at work and nuke
for 10 minutes on high.

Option: I would think this would be good with some caraway seed or
Oregano added. I could also imagine using 2 teaspoons of sweet curry
instead of the pepper and paprika.
