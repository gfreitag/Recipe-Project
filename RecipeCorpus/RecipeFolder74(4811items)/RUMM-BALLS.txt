Title: RUMM BALLS
Categories: Desserts, Holiday
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Vanilla wafers crushed fine
1 c  Walnuts chopped fine
3 tb Corn syrup
1/2 c  Rum
3 tb Cocoa powder
1 c  10x sugar
Mix all ingredients except powdered sugar. I find that I have to add
more rum to make the "dough" stick together. Roll into small balls
about 1 inch in diameter. Then roll in powdered sugar.
I usually double this recipe as these are eaten FAST! Put in tightly
covered container and leave in a place where you won't be tempted to
eat them for 3 weeks minimum. They can have a different flavor
depending on the type/brand of rum you use.
