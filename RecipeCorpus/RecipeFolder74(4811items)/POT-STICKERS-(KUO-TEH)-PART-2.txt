Title: POT STICKERS (KUO TEH) PART 2
Categories: Chinese, Dim sum, Yee
Yield: 1 Servings
-Directions, continued.
COOKING: Heat 2 tbsp. of oil in a 12 inch heavy skillet over medium
high heat. Lightly brown Pot Stickers until golden on the bottom,
pour 1 cup water into the skillet and cover immediately. Cook over
medium heat until most of the liquid is absorbed. Uncover and
continue cooking until liquid is completely absorbed and the Pot
Stickers are golden brown on the bottom. Serve with dip. Another good
dip is chili oil. DO AHEAD NOTES: Wrap and freeze them. Cook just
before serving. Pot Stickers turn out even better when the freezing
process gives the filling additional moisture, making them juicier
and tastier! Add 5-7 more minutes to cooking time if frozen.
COMMENTS: To prevent Pot Stickers from actually sticking to the
bottom of the pan, it is best to use either a Teflon, a heavy bottom
commercial aluminum, a cast iron or a well seasoned steel skillet.
