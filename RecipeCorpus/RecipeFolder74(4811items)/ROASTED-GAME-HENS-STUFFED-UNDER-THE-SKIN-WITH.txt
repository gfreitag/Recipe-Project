1    Egg yolk, lightly beaten
1/4 c  Finely chopped fresh basil

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the ricotta in a fine sieve and
drain for 30 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine the drained ricotta,
Parmesan, egg yolk, herbs and lemon zest. Put the garlic clove
through a garlic press and into the ricotta. Mix well, adding salt
and pepper to taste. Rinse the game hens and pat them dry. Season the
cavities with salt and pepper and place a quarter lemon and a quarter
onion in each cavity. Loosen the skin on the breasts by sliding your
fingers under the skin, being careful not to pierce it. Spoon the
ricotta mixture under the skin (about 4 tablespoons of stuffing per
bird.) Truss the birds. Place the birds, breast side up, in a shallow
roasting pan. Pour the white wine into the pan. Bake for 1 hour, or
until the juices run clear when the hen is pierced in the thickest
part of the thigh. Remove from the oven and serve with the pan juices
spooned over the hens. Yield : 6 servings Posted to MC-Recipe Digest
