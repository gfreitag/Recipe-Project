Categories: Korean, Main dish, Pork, Meats, Ethnic
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Pork shoulder or other lean-
-pork
2 ea Scallions
1 ea Clove garlic
1 tb Sesame oil
1 tb Sesame seeds
1 tb Sugar
Dash black pepper
4 tb Kochu chang
This dish is fairly spicy: it gets its highly seasoned flavor from
kochee chang (Red Bean Paste, found in many Oriental food stores. If
it is not available, Japanese miso sauce amy be substituted).
Although the amount indicated is recommended, it is possible to use a
little less.

1.  Cut the pork into 4 or 5 slices about 1/4 inch thick.

2.  Mince the scallions. Mince or crush the garlic. Combine both
ingredients with the remaining seasonings in a bowl. Add the pork
slices and mix well until all sides of the pork are coated.

3. Grill immediately or marinate until ready to serve. It is
important that the pork be well done; the outside should be dark,
almost charred. A charcoal, an electric or an oven grill may be used.
