Title: ROMAINE LETTUCE WITH OYSTER SAUCE
Categories: Chinese, Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Head romaine lettuce
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Peanut oil
1 tb Premium oyster sauce
We decided on romaine lettuce for this dish because it is crisp
textured, and readily available.

Preparation:  Wash & remove core from lettuce. Combine oil & oyster
sauce in small sauce pan; bring to simmer; keep hot until ready to
serve.

Blanching: Heat about 2 gallons water in large pot. We use bottom of
aluminum steamer.  Add salt.  When water reaches rolling boil, blanch
lettuce for about 20 seconds - until leaves are bright green.

Remove leaves, shake off excess water.  Stack leaves & cut cross-wise
into 4 parts.  Use cleaver to place leaves on serving platter. Pour
hot oyster sauce on leaves. Serve.
