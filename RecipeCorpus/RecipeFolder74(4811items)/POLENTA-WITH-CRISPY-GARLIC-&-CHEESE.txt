Categories: Low-fat, Side dishes
Yield: 8 Servings
1 tb Olive oil
4    Cloves garlic -- peeled and
Chopped
1/2 ts Ground cumin
4 c  Water
1 ts Salt
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
4 oz Green chiles -- (canned),
Chopped
1 c  Lowfat cheddar cheese --
Shredded
In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. When hot,
add the garlic and saute 3 minutes, until golden. Remove from heat
and stir in the cumin. Set aside. In a large pan, combine the water
and salt. Bring to a boil, and slowly add the cornmeal, whisking to
blend. When the mixture comes back to a boil, cover and reduce heat
to medium-low and cook about 20 minutes, until the mixture starts to
come away from the pan. Stir often. Remove from heat and stir in the
garlic, chilies and cheese. Spread a lightly oiled 9-by-13 inch
baking dish. Refrigerate until set. Cut the polenta into 8 pieces;
cut each piece on the diagona l into 2 triangles. Place on a lightly
oiled baking sheet and broil on the top oven shelf about 4 to 5
minutes on both sides. The polenta should be browned and crispy on
the outside and creamy on the inside. Recipe By : Karen Lee and Diane
