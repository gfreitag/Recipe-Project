Title: RED BEAN PASTE (KOREAN KOCHU CHANG)
Categories: Korean, Condiments, Ethnic
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Red bean paste
2 tb Powdered red cayenne pepper
2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
Red bean paste is particularly tasty served with fresh scallions and
radishes or added to some soups. Korean kochu chang may be pruchased
at many Oriental food stores. If it is not available, Japanese miso
sauce may be substituted. This recipe is for a more pungent kochu
chang than that which comes directly from the jar.

1. Mix all the ingredients well. Serve in a small dish for dipping.
