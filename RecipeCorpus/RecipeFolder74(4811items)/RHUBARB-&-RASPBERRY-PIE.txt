Nostalgia reigns with this satisfying dessert pie. The wonderfully
crunchy crust makes a great combination with the smooth slightly tart
filling. Preparation time: 20 minutes.  Cooking time: 1 hour plus 1
hour standing for pastry.

Crumbly Pastry 2 cups plain flour 1/4 cup sugar pinch of salt 125g
unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 eggs, lightly beaten with a
fork

Filling 500g rhubarb, trimmed and roughly chopped 1/4 cup water 1/2
cup sugar 2 teaspoons lemon zest 250g raspberries (fresh or frozen
but if using frozen raspberries drain excess juice) 2 teaspoons
cornflour To serve: icing sugar to dust

To prepare the pastry, combine flour, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl
or blender.  Make a well in centre of dry ingredients and add butter
and eggs. Using a fork, rapidly combine ingredients, or blend for
about 30 seconds to combine.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface and
knead briefly. Gather pastry into a ball, wrap in plastic food wrap
and refrigerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: place
rhubarb, water and sugar in a saucepan and cook over a medium heat
for 6-8 minutes, until rhubarb is tender.  Cool slightly, then gently
fold in lemon zest, raspberries and cornflour mixed with a little
water.  Divide dough into 2 pieces, one slightly bigger than the
other. Chill the smaller ball. On a well floured board, roll larger
ball to fit a 24cm round pie dish to a thickness of about 3mm.  Line
pie dish with pastry. Spoon fill- ing over pastry base. Grate chilled
pastry over top of filling. Bake at l80C for 50-60 minutes until
light golden in colour. Serve warm, sprinkled with icing sugar.
