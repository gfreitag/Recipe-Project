In this popular dish, the Japanese enjoy eating their fish completely
raw, cut in slivers about 1/4 inch thick, and dipped into a mixture
of fresh chopped gingerroot, grated horseradish and mustard. We add
dishes of very fresh greens, turning the Sashimi into a salad.

If your fish is very, very fresh, your dishes colorful and
attractively arranged, and if you accompany your first bite of raw
fish with a generous mouthful of crisp greens, you will probably be
able to overcome your prejudices and discover what the Japanese have
known for centuries: fish doesn't have to be cooked to taste good.

INSTRUCTIONS: Set out the slivered fish, 3 dishes of seasonings and
salad greens and let everyone mix his own sauce, tasting and testing
as he does, and help himself to greens.
