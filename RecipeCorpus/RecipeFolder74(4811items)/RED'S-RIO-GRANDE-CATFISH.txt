In this part of the country, the table fish of choice is the
catfish--at least it's the most common. You can usually order this
fish prepared any way that you like it, as long as it's fried. Now,
I've no complaints with a well-fried catfish, but there had to be
another way.

So a couple of nights ago, a few friends were over and we tried out
this idea. Our "impartial" panel of judges decided that this was a
definite keeper, and we are pleased to pass it on to you, literally,
hot off the grill!

Combine the first eight ingredients in a blender and coarsely blend.
Place the filets in a non-reactive container large enough to hold
them in a single layer. Pour the marinade over the filets and cover.
Turn the filets once after thirty minutes. After a total marinating
time of no more than one hour (any longer and they'll start to fall
apart), grill them quickly over very hot mesquite coals, about 2-4
minutes per side, basting with the marinade. Place each filet on a
plate, and top with 1/4 cup of chilled chopped tomatoes.
