In a saucepan, combine milk with 1/3 cup of the sugar; heat until
scalding. In a bowl, beat egg yolks with remaining sugar and salt.
Slowly whisk hot milk into the egg mixture. Return to saucepan and
cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until custard
thickens enough to coat a wooden spoon. Do not let mixture boil or it
will curdle.

Sprinkle gelatin over water to soften; stir into hot custard and
remove from heat. Add vanilla and strain sauce through a fine sieve.
Cool custard by setting pan in a larger container filled with ice
cubes. Stir occasionally until sauce starts to thicken and become
syrupy.

Whip cream until stiff. Puree raspberries in a food processor or
blender and then strain through a sieve to remove seeds (use spoon to
press juice through sieve and a rubber spatula to help remove it from
the other side). Fold whipped cream into custard, then fold in pureed
strained raspberries.

Rinse a 6-cup mould with cold water. Pour in custard mixture and
cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or
overnight. To serve, dip mould briefly in warm water, dry off and
place serving plate over top. Quickly invert and turn out onto
serving plate. Trim with fresh berries or mint leaves.
