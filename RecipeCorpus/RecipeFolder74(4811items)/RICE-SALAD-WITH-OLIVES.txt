Categories: Salads, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
75 g  Long-grain rice
25 g  Wild rice

Rice salads, like risottos, can be made through all the seasons of
the year using fresh vegetables of your choice. This one is very
simply made with olives, spring onions and parsley, and dressed with
oil and vinegar. Lovely as part of a cold table with a variety of
salads to go with it.

Cook the two rices separately, as instructed on the packets. Whisk
together the vinegar with the oil, and season with salt and pepper.
Dress the warm rice with the mixture. Toss in the stuffed olives,
spring onions and parsley and mix well. Leave at room temperature for
a few hours so that the flavours can amalgamate before serving.
