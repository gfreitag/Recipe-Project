Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add cornmeal and saute, stirring
constantly, for a minute so all grains are coated with oil. Add the
broth and bring liquid to a boil whisking all the while. When this
comes to a boil it will bubble up. Quickly put a lid on and turn heat
down to very low; cook until it no longer tastes raw, about 20
minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet. Add peppers, cover
and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Uncover skillet, crumble in
ground beef and cook until no longer pink. Add salsa and cook
uncovered for 5 minutes until thick. Adjust seasoning.

To serve, ladle cornmeal in bowl; spoon beef and salsa sauce over top
and sprinkle with cilantro and grated aged Jack cheese.
