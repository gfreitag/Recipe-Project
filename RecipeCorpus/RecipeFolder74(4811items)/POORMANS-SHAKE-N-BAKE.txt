Title: POORMANS SHAKE N BAKE
Categories: Spices
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Flour
2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 c  Bran flake cereal, crushed
2 tb Parsley flakes
2 ts Garlic powder
1 tb Onion powder
2 ts Chili powder
2 tb Taco seasoning
1 ts Season pepper
1 ts Curry (or more)
1 ts Sweet basil
1 ts Oregano
Mix all together and use for coating any and all types of meat. I use
a large size ZipLoc and just keep it in the freezer. You can add more
of the cayenne and chili powder if you so desire. I usually just
throw in what I have at the time I make it so it is never the same
twice. It is a great all round coating.
