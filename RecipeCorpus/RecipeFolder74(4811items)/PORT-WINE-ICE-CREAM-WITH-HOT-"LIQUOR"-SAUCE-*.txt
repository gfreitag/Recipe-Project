MMMMM---------------------HOT "LIQUOR" SAUCE--------------------------
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Packed dark brown sugar
9 tb Unsalted butter
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 1/2 c  Hershey's chocolate cocoa;
-sifted & unsweetened
1/4 ts Salt
EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk,
electric mixer with paddle, rubber spatule, instant-read test
thermometer, 2 stainless steel bowls (1 large), ice-cream freezer,
2-qt plastic container with lid, ice cream scoop or paddle

Port Wine "Ice Cream" Heat the heavy cream and half-and-half in a 2
1/2-qt saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/4 cup sugar
and stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil.

While the cream is heating, place the eggs and the remaining 1/2 cup
sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the
eggs on medium for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, then
beat on medium until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, 2 1/2 to 3
minutes. (At this point, the cream should be boiling. If not, adjust
mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream boils. If this
is not done, the eggs will develop undesirable lumps.)
