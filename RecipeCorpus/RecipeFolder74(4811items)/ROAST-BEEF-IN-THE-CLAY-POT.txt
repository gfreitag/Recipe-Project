"Roast beef steamed in the clay pot is a different experience. The
meat has a delightful texture you can't find in beef cooked any other
way. But one word of caution: it's going to take much less time to
cook than you think. Rely strictly on your meat thermometer. The size
of both the pot and roast will make a difference. If you like your
beef rare, check the thermometer after 40 minutes. You can omit the
vegetables if you don't want a complete dinner."

Presoak your largest clay pot, top and bottom, in water fifteen
minutes.

Trim fat from beef and rub with salt and pepper. Place beef in pot and
insert meat thermometer. Add to pot all above ingredients, plus 1
teaspoon salt and dash of pepper.

Place covered pot in cold oven. Set temperature to 480 degrees. For
rare beef, check meat thermometer after 40 minutes. For medium beef,
check after 1 hour. For well-done beef--if you really want it that
way--check after 90 minutes.

Remove pot from oven when meat thermometer is almost up to
temperature. (Don't wait until it's right on the nose or it will be
overdone.) Pour liquid into saucepan, bring to boil and thicken with
about 1/2 teaspoon arrowroot.
