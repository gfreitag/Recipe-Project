first when you add raisins the bread won't rise as high and when you
add bran or other types of flour bread won't rise as high.
I take it this recipe came with the book. I have made hundreds of
loaves of raisins bread and not one has been the same. I change
something each time. This is my favorite. I hope you like this. I
also like the sourdough raisin bread replace 1 cup of water with
starter also take 5 cardamom seeds and take out of pod add whole
leave out the oatmeal or add more water.
