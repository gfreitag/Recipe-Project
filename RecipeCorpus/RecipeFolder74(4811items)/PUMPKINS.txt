Selecting and storing: Pass on the jack-o'-lantern variety (too tough
and stringy! ); for cooking, always choose a sugar pie pumpkinÂ—a
smaller, sweeter variety with a finer flesh. Select a crack- and
soft-spot-free pumpkin with a rounded, dry stem. If the stem is
blackened or moist, move on. Store in a cool dry place, uncut, for up
to 1 month. If cut, wrap tightly and refrigerate up to 1 week. Buy
canned. It's an excellent alternative; just as pure, equally
nutritious, and so quick and easy!

Enjoying: Here's the simplest way to prepare fresh pumpkin: Rinse,
cut in half and scoop out seeds and stringy fibers. Place cut sides
down in a baking pan with 1/4 in. water. Bake at 350F about 45 min.
When cool, scoop out soft flesh and drain in a colander. Puree in a
food processor, then drain again thoroughly. Use immediately or
freeze up to 9 months in 1 c. containers for later use. (Even
simpler, open a can!) Spice up the autumn air; get out your favorite
pumpkin recipes, but reduce the fat: For pumpkin pie, use evaporated
skim milk, not cream, and egg substitute instead of eggs, and buy a
low-fat graham-cracker crust; for pumpkin bread, replace the oil with
half as much prune puree and use egg substitute; or brew a warm, cozy
pumpkin soup, using evaporated skim milk, not heavy cream! Slather
pumpkin puree (canned or fresh) mixed with molasses (to taste) on a
multigrain, nonfat toasted waffle for a nutritious breakfast, lunch
or after-school snack.-by Mary Nagle with Teresa Yeykal
