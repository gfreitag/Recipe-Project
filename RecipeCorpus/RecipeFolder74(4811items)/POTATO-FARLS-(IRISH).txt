Categories: Breads, Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/4 lb Potatoes (3 or 4)
2 tb Butter, melted
1 c  Flour, all purpose
1/2 ts Salt
4 ts Vegetable oil
Peel and halve potatoes; put in large saucepan with enough water to
cover. Bring to boil; simmer, covered, 20 to 30 minutes, until
fork-tender. Drain well; return to saucepan over low heat.  Add
butter; mash potatoes well. Stir in flour and salt.  Gather mixture
into a ball; turn onto lightly floured surface. Knead lightly until
smooth. Divide dough in half. Roll out one half into an 8 in. (20 cm)
circle, about 1/4 in. thick. Cut into quarters; set aside. Repeat
with remaining dough. In large nonstick skillet, heat half the oil
over medium-high heat. Cook dough quarters in batches, 2 minutes on
each side or until golden brown, adding more oil as necessary. Serve
warm.
