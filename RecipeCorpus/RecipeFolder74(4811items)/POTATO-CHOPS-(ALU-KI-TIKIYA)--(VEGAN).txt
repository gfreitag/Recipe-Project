ABBREVIATIONS: ts = teaspoon
tb = tablespoon
sm = small

Mix all ingredients (except oil spray) together well. Divide into
portions (as many as specified in "yield") and shape each into a
thick flat round.

Heat a large frying pan (skillet). Spray with a little oil or grease
lightly. Cook 3-4 potato cakes at a time, depending on how large the
pan is.

Do for about 5 minutes on each side until golden - DO NOT disturb them
until the 5 minutes is up or you will spoil the crust. When they have
been cooking 5 minutes try and lift them gently with a spatula. Lift
rather than scrape, and flip over, remembering that they will still
be very soft in the middle. If you like, use another spatula placed
over the top of the chop to keep it together whilst turning over.

Keep them warm in the oven at a moderate heat (375 F, 190 C, Gas 5)
while you cook the others. Recipe from Quick and Easy Indian Cooking

the same one who makes khoya out of powdered milk.
