Title: REHRUECKEN
Categories: Cakes, Ethnic, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Eggs
1/2 c  Plus 1 Tbsp sugar (120 g)
3/4 c  Flour (80 g)
2 tb Butter (30 g)
1/2    Cup* poundcake crumbs (30 g)
1 1/2 oz Cocoa (40 g)
Cinnamon
Grated lemon peel
Glaze:
2 3/4 oz Chocolate (80 g) [This would
-be semisweet baking
Chocolate.  K.B.]
1 c  Less 2 Tbsp sugar (200 g)
Currant jelly
1 3/4 oz Almond slivers (50 g)
[*Note: I'm wildly guessing on the conversion for the poundcake
crumbs. One slice (1/17 th of a whole 8 1/2 x 3 1/2 x 3 1/4
poundcake) claims to weigh 30 grams, per USDA info. K.B.]

Combine the whole eggs with the sugar, hold the bowl over some
steaming water, and beat until cooled off. Add flour, cake crumbs,
cinnamon and lemon peel.  Then add the melted butter with the cocoa.
Pour into a well greased and floured Rehruecken mold, bake 45 minutes
at medium heat, cut through once, fill with currant jelly, ice with
chocolate glaze and stud with almond slivers.
