Title: RHUBARB CRUMBLE-CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Fruits
Yield: 10 Servings
14 oz Rhubarb, trimmed weight
10 oz Self-raising flour
7 oz Butter
4 oz Caster sugar
3 oz Pale muscovado sugar
1    Orange
1 1/2 oz Chopped hazelnut kernels
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 lg Eggs
First make the nutty crumble topping.  Sift 4 oz flour into a bowl,
and add 3 oz butter.  Do not rub in the fat but cut it in with a
pastry blender or a pair of knives used like scissors. Stir in the
muscovado sugar and nuts and set aside.

Sift the remaining 6 oz flour and the cinnamon into a separate bowl
and reserve.  Slice the rhubarb into 1-inch chunks and finely grate
the zest of the orange over it. Cream the remaining 1/4 lb butter
with the caster sugar until pale, creamy and light.  Break up the
eggs with a fork and add them to the butter mixture a little at a
time, alternating with spoonfuls of the flour and cinnamon and add 2
tablespoons of orange juice.

Spoon the cake mixture evenly over the base of a 9-inch spring-clip
tin that has been greased, lined and greased again. Scatter the
rhubarb and orange mixture evenly over the top then cover the fruit
with the nutty crumble mixture.  Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for
about 1 1/4 hours.

Leave in a warm draught-free place to cool down slowly after baking
and wait until the crumble-cake is completely cold before taking it
out of the tin.  Wait until the next day before eating.
