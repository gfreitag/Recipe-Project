Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings

-sliced thin
14 oz Can coconut milk
2 tb Red curry paste
1/4 c  Fish sauce
3 tb Brown sugar
1 c  Ground roasted peanuts
1    Package frozen chopped
-spinach
Microwave (or just defrost) the spinach, and drain really well.

Cook the chicken in the coconut mile on med heat about 10 minutes.
Since it is sliced so thinly, the chicken should be cooked. Remove
the chicken from the coconut milk and put aside. In the saved milk,
cook the red curry paste, sugar, fish sauce and peanuts on medium
heat, stirring constantly for 10 minutes.

Add the spinach, and then the chicken.  Stir until warm. Serve
