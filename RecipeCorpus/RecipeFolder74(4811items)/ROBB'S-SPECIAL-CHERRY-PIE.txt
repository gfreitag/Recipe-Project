Categories: Pies, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
2 2/3 c  Pastry flour
1 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
Ice water - 8 to 12 tbs
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2    (1 lb.) cans pitted tart red
- cherries (water pack)
1/3 c  Liquid from cherries
3 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Almond extract
1 ts Lemon juice
1/2 ts Red food coloring
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
1/16 ts Ground cloves
2 tb Butter or margarine
(DIRECTIONS FOR PASTRY) Combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl.
Cut shortening into flour mixture, using pastry blender, until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs with a few pea-size pieces. Sprinkle 4
tablespoons ice water over mixture and toss mixture with two forks.
Sprinkle another 4 tablespoons ice water over mixture and toss
mixture again. If mixture can be pressed together to form a solid
mass do not add additional water. If mixture is still crumbly, add
additional ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing mixture with
forks, until a mass can be formed. Divide mixture and form 2 balls of
dough, one slightly larger than the other. Press the larger ball of
dough into a disk and roll between sheets of waxed paper until
1/8-inch thick. Line deep 9-inch pyrex pie plate with pastry and trim
edges to 3/4-inch beyond edge of plate.  Set aside. Press remaining
ball of dough into a disk and roll between sheets of waxed paper
until 1/8-inch thick. Set aside. (DIRECTIONS FOR FILLING) Drain
cherries. Measure 1/3 cup liquid into mixing bowl. Discard remaining
liquid. Add tapioca, salt, almond extract, lemon juice and food
coloring, then cherries. Combine 1 cup sugar, cinnamon and cloves.
Pour sugar mixture over cherries. Mix and let stand at least 15
minutes. Fill pastry with cherry mixture. Dot with butter. Sprinkle
with remaining sugar. Moisten rim with water. Fit top pastry over
filling. Turn top edge over bottom edge and press firmly together,
creating fluted edge. Cut vents in top to allow steam to escape and
juices to bubble. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce
temperature to 375 degrees and continue baking for 35-45 minutes, or
until filling is bubbling and crust is golden brown. If edge of crust
appears to be browning too quickly, cover lightly with aluminum foil.
Cool pie thoroughly on wire rack. Note:  The spice flavor is quite
subtle, but very effective when combined with the lemon juice and
almond extract. Try these modest amounts first (I prefer them), or
increase them to suit
