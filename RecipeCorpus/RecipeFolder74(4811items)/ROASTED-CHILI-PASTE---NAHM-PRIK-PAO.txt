Title: ROASTED CHILI PASTE - NAHM PRIK PAO
Categories: Thai, Condiment
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Small Dried Red Chilies
1/2 c  Unpeeled Shallots, Halved
Lengthwise
1/4 c  Unpeeled Garlic Cloves,
Halved Lengthwise
1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
In a wok or small, heavy skillet, dry-fry the chilies over low heat
until they darken and become fragrant and brittle, about 5 minutes.
Shake the pan and stir frequently as they roast. Remove from the heat
and transfer to a small plate to cool.  In the same pan over medium
heat, dry-fry the shallots and garlic, turning occasionally, until
they are softened, wilted and blistered, 5 minutes.  They should have
small, black burnt spots but not be burned all over.  Remove from the
heat and transfer to a small plate to cool. Stem the chilies and
shake out and discard most of the seeds. Cut the chilies into small
pieces.  Trim the shallots and garlic, discarding the peels and root
ends, and cut them into small pieces. Combine the chilies, garlic and
shallots in a large, heavy mortar. Pound and grind with a pestle
until you have a fairly smooth paste, 20 to 30 minutes. Use a spoon
to scrape the sides down now and then. Set aside. In a wok or small,
deep skillet over medium heat, warm the oil for 1 minute. Add the
paste and cook, stirring occasionally until the paste slowly darkens
to a deep brownish black and releases a rich fragrance, about 5
minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the chili paste, with it's
oil, to a jar. Cool to room temperature uncovered, then seal tightly.
It will keep at room temperature for 1 month.  Makes about 1-1/2 cups.
