Title: PUMPKIN BISCUITS
Categories: Breads, Fruits
Yield: 2 Dozen
1/2 c  Hot milk
2 tb Butter
3 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Pureed pumpkin or winter
- squash
1 ts Salt
3 1/4 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
Combine hot milk, butter, sugar, pumpkin, salt and 1/4 cup flour in a
large bowl. Stir yeast into 1/4 cup warm water and let stand for 5
minutes or until bubbly.  Add yeast to the first mixture and beat
vigorously. Cover and leave in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes or
until light. Stir in 2-3 cups flour until dough leaves sides of bowl.
Turn out onto a floured surface and knead in flour until dough is
smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl,
turning it to grease the top. Cover and place in a warm draft-free
place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down, and
turn out onto a lightly floured board. Roll dough with a rolling pin
to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 2 inch rounds. Place rounds about 1
inch apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise for 20
minutes or until almost double in size. Bake in a preheated 400 F.
oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. HINT: Place bottom
pan on top oven rack and top pan on bottom oven rack after first six
minutes of baking to ensure even brownness. Baker's note: This recipe
rates four stars.  It has a wonderful flavour, and a nice golden
brown colour. It would be good to serve at Thanksgiving dinner.
