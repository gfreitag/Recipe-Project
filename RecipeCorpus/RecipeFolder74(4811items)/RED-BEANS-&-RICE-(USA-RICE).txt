"A lightening-quick version of the classic, this cooks in the time it
takes to boil the rice.  Hot sauce, please?"

In a medium nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat; add ham (if
using), onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic and jalapeno pepper. Cook,
stirring constantly, until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add

reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.
