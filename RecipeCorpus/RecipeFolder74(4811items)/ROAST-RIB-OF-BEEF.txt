Title: ROAST RIB OF BEEF
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lb Rib Beef Roasting Joint
1/2 tb Plain flour
1/2 ts Garlic Salt
1/2 ts Ground Bay Leaves
1/2 ts Paprika
This is the classic roast, crispy brown on the outside, tender and
pink on the inside. Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 7, 425F, 220C. Mix
the flour and spices and sprinkle over the beef, patting it well. Put
the beef on to a rack over a tin, place in the oven and lower to Gas
Mark 4, 350F,180C. For rare beef roast for 12 minutes per pound, or
15 minutes for medium. Let it rest for 25 minutes before carving -
this will make the beef more tender and juicy. Use the pan drippings
to make a delicious gravy.
