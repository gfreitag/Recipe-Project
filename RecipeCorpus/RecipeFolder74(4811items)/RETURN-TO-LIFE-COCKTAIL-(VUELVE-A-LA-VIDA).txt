1/2 lb Octopus
3 lb Small to medium shrimp
1/3 lb Crab meat
1/3 lb Squid

Plus enough for garnish,if
Desired
2    Green onions, including tops
Sliced into fine disks
2 tb Minced cilantro
Boil each type of seafood in salted water separately, until tender:

Octopus: You may have to purchase a whole octopus. A large one (more
than l pound) may require up to 2 hours; a smaller one may take only
l 1/2 hours. Cut the thick portions of cooked octopus meat into
1/2-inch rings, but leave the slender tips of the ten

Shrimp The shrimp are done when they turn pink about 3 to 4 minutes.
After cooking, cool and peel.

Crab meat Fresh crabmeat requires about 3 minutes of cooking. Cool and
remove meat from the shells.

Squid: Cut the squid into 1/4-inch rings, removing the hard core from
the head and separating the tentacles into 3 or 4 bunches. Boil only
for about l0 minutes; overcooking will toughen meat.

Prepare the sauce. Toss the prepared seafood with the vegetables and
cilantro. Serve in old-fashioned ice-cream sundae glasses or in fluted
goblets. If desired, you may garnish with slices of avocado. Makes
4    servings.

Cocktail Sauce: Mix together 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup fresh lime
juice, 1/4 cup water and salt to taste.
