Title: RASPBERRY JAM
Categories: Fruits, Preserves
Yield: 1 Servings
12 c  Raspberries (6 pints)
3 c  Sugar
1 1/3 c  Homemade pectin
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
Pick over the raspberries for any leaves or unusable fruit. There
should be 3 packed quarts.  Combine with the sugar in a large bowl
and let stand at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight in the
refrigerator. Stir occasionally. Stir together the raspberry mixture,
pectin, and lemon juice in a large shallow nonreactive preserving pan
and place over high heat. Bring to a full boil, skimm off foam, then
lower heat to medium. Stir often so the bottom does not burn. When
the jam is sufficiently thickened, the bubbles on top will become
smaller and the jam will look like bubbling tar. This takes
approximately 20 minutes, depending on the size of the pan. If the
jam is still too liquid, continue cooking for 5 minutes more and test
again. Turn off the heat and remove a tablespoon of jam to a small
plate to test.
Chill in the freezer for 5 minutes.  If the jam is the consistency
desired, turn the heat to low while ladling the jam into hot
sterilized jars.  Wipe rims clean with a damp towel. Seal with new
lids and metal rings.  Process in a hot-water bath for 5 minutes.
Remove, cool, check seals, label, and store.
