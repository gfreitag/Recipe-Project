Title: PORK SHAU MAI (DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Chinese, Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 lb Pork loin
1 1/3 oz Pork fat
4    Black mushrooms
-(pre-softened)
1    Precooked bamboo shoot
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Cooking wine
1/2 tb Sesame oil
1 ts Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
30    Won ton skins
24    Green peas
Filling: dice the pork, fat, mushrooms, and bamboo shoot. Place in
bowl. Add liquids and seasonings and stir well. Throw filling against
inside of bowl for 3-4 minutes so ingredients combine thoroughly.
Divide into 24 portions.

Place one filling in center of won ton skin. Cup skin up around
filling but don't close - 'make a waist'. Place one green pea in the
center of the filling.  Use knife to compress and even out filling
until below top edge of skin. Place in steamer about half inch apart.
Steam for six minutes on high.  Remove. Serve.

You can use beef, shrimp, quail eggs, or sweet rice for the above.

You can get 'won ton' and 'dumpling' skins as well as egg roll
wrappers at local chinese groceries.  You can make your own; but
ready-made fresh or frozen ones are quicker.
