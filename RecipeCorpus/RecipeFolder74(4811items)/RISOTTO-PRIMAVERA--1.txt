Bring chicken stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to
low. Cover and keep warm.

Heat oil in large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and
celery and saute 3 minutes. Add rice and stir about 30 seconds. Add
potatoes, beans, tomatoes and carrot and saute 10 minutes, adding a
bit of stock if it becomes too dry.

Add 1/2 cup of stock to rice, reduce heat and simmer until liquid is
absorbed, stirring frequently. Continue adding stock a half cup at a
time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be completely
absorebed before adding another. Add artichokes, asparagus and peas
about half way through the process when a little more than half the
stock has been used. Continue adding stock in the same manner until
rice is tender but still slightly firm to the bite. Remove from heat.
Season with salt and pepper. Stir in butter, then cheese.
