Title: PYI-GYI NGA KAZUN YWET (SQUID & DANDELION S
Categories: Burma, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ts Dried red hot chili flakes
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Brown sugar
2 ts Corn OR peanut oil
1    Clove garlic, chopped fine
1 lb Fresh squids, dressed, cut
-into 1/2-inch round slices
1/4 lb Dandelion greens, green
-leaves only, halved
Watercress and Swiss chard are good substitutes for dandelion since
they all have a slightly bitter but appealing taste.

1.  Mix the chili flakes, lemon juice, soy sauce, and sugar together.
Let stand for 15 minutes.

2.  Heat the oil in a wok or skillet and over moderate heat fry the
garlic for 1 minute.  Add the squid slices and stir fry for 2
minutes. Add the chili/lemon mixture and continue to fry.

3.  Add the dandelion greens and cook for 2 minutes more. Do not
overcook since it toughens the squid.

Serve warm with other dishes.
