Yield: 12 Servings

3 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening; (Crisco)

1 c  American cheese;
-(sharp)(grated)
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Sift dry ingredients together. Add 1/2 of
grated cheese to Crisco, and mix well then cut the shortening into
the dry ingredients. Mix everything in until it becomes coarse. Add
buttermilk, and mix until it becomes uniform. Drop biscuits into
greased muffin tins. This will make about 12 or so. When you have
completed this sprinkle over the rest of the cheese, a little extra
garlic powder, and some dried parsley. Bake for 12 - 15 minutes. When
done remove from oven, and brush on a little butter. Serve while
still warm.

I haven't tried these yet, but the original are my favorite biscuits.
