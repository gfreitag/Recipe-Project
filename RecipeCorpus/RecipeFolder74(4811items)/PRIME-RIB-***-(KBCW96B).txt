Title: PRIME RIB *** (KBCW96B)
Categories: Main dish, Beef, Party
Yield: 8 Servings
8 lb Rib roast ; standing
Cooking times,  20 min/pound = rare.  30 min/pound = med. 40 min/pound
??????? Sprinkle with garlic powder, thyme and marjoram. Roast
uncovered with a little water in the pan to keep the roast from
drying out.
Forgot to say at the start, use 325 Degrees.  Don't let the water >>
dry out in the bottom of the pan.
This is where you get your top quality au jus to make a great gravy.
You'll never use a bouillon cube or a can of garbage gravy again.
When the roast is done scrape the browned drippings from the pan, add
a little more water and bring to a simmer.  Add a bit of corn starch
in water and let it thicken, stirring all the time so it doesn't get
lumpy. Top quality meal along with your other > potatoes, veggies and
salad.
No one can give exact step by step ways to make a great meal. You'll
have to get into the idea of cooking and spend time doing it. You'll
find yourself doing your own little things and making top quality
food. FROM: JOHN SLUIS   (KBCW96B)
