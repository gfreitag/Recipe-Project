1    Red pepper
1    Tomato (red or yellow)
1    Fennel bulb
1 sm Onion, skin intact
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
Roasting the vegetables first gives an extra dimension to the flavors
in this relish, and the crunchy, slightly licorice taste of the
fennel is a pleasant surprise. From Leah Bergen.

Roast all the vegetables in a 400 degree F. oven for 35 to 45 minutes.

Remove the skin from the pepper, tomato and onion. Discard the pepper
core and seeds; trim any tough outer leaves from the fennel, and trim
the base.

Dice vegetables into small relish-size bits and put in a clean glass
jar. Cover with the vinegar and olive oil and refrig- erate. Will
keep 7 to 10 days refrigerated.

Uses: This delicious relish seems to go with everything from stuffed
pasilla chiles to poached salmon and steamed Blue Lake beans.

Makes 1 1/2 pints.
