Title: RHUBARB - STEWED
Categories: Fruits, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 10-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 7 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A lug weighs 28 pounds and yields 14 to 28 quarts--an average of
1-1/2 pounds per quart.

Quality: Select young, tender, well-colored stalks from the spring or
late fall crop.

Procedure: Trim off leaves. Wash stalks and cut into 1/2-inch to
1-inch pieces. In a large saucepan add 1/2 cup sugar for each quart
of fruit. Let stand until juice appears. Heat gently to boiling. Fill
jars without delay, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and
process.
