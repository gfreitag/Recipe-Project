Title: ROBB'S OATMEAL RAISIN SCONES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 18 Scones
4 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1 3/4 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
2    Sticks butter, chilled
3 c  Rolled oats
1 c  Raisins
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
in a large bowl.  Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add to
the flour mixture.  Use either your fingers or a pastry cutter to rub
or cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse
crumbs. Add the oats and raisins, tossing or stirring with a fork
until you can gather the dough into a rough ball.

Sprinkle a board with flour and put the dough on it. Knead 6 or 7
times. Divide the dough into 3 equal parts. Pat each part into a
circle and 1/2 inch thick. Cut each circle into wedges. Put the
wedges on ungreased baking sheets 1/2 inch apart.  Bake for about 25
minutes, or until the scones are lightly browned. Serve warm.
