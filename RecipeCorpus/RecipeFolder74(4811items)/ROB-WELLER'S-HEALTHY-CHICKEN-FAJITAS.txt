Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM----------------------CHICKEN FILLING---------------------------
1 lg Plump chicken breast
1/2 c  Celery (tops and tender,
-inside stalks)
1/2 md White onion
2    Or 3 peppercorns
2 tb Olive oil
1    Red pepper
1    Yellow pepper
1 1/2 lg Red onions
1/2 c  Chopped cilantro leaves
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
MMMMM------------------------BEAN FILLING-----------------------------
1 lb Bag of pinto beans (red or
-pink)
8 c  Water
Salt to taste
1/4    Onion
1/4 c  Olive oil
Poach chicken with celery tops, onions and peppercorns. Cook for
about 15 minutes.  Let cool and remove skin. When chicken is skinned,
slice or shred, then saute with olive oil in wok or large skillet
until barely browned around the edges.  Next add red and yellow
peppers and red onions. Toss and saute for about 10 minutes. Watch
closely so that peppers don't go limp.  Add cilantro leaves. Remove
from heat.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Combine with beans (see
below). Place in tortillas, top with salsa and serve.

Cook beans in water for approximately 1 1/2 hours on medium heat.

Make sure that beans are completely covered in water. Stir
occasionally. Beans will absorb liquid and become soft. Add more
water if needed. Add salt when beans are thoroughly cooked. Remove
from heat. Add chopped onion. (Onions will cook from the heat of the
beans.) Drizzle with olive oil. Let sit.

TORTILLAS: Warm six large flour tortillas in microwave on high (in
large zip lock bag to preserve moisture) for about 30 seconds.

SALSA: Two large, peeled and chopped tomatoes.

Serves 4.
