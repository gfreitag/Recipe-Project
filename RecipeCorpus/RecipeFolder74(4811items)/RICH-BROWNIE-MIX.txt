mixing bowl; beat slightly. Stir in 4 tablespoons melted butter or
margarine which has been cooled. Lightly spoon 2 cupsof the mix into
the mixing bowl; do not pack the mix when measuring. Beat well with a
spoon to make a somewhat smooth batter; stir in 1/2 cup chopped nuts,
if desired. Spread into a greased and floured 8 x 8 x 2 inch pan.

a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan then cut
into squares.
