Title: RATZELACH FROM POLAND (PANCAKES FROM POLAND)
Categories: Breakfast, Holiday
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Milk
3    Eggs; well beaten
Confectioners' Sugar
Sift together the flour and salt; make a well in the center and pour
in the milk, stirring, from center out, to form a smooth batter. Add
eggs and enclose with a folding motion. This should be a very thin
batter. Melt a very little fat in a med.-sized frying pan, greasing
the surface well. When hot, pour in just enough batter to cover the
bottom of the pan, tilting it from side to side to spread the batter
to the edges. Brown first on one side and then on the other. Stack 5
or 6 "ratzelach," sprinkling confectioners' sugar between the layers;
then cut into wedges for serving. Makes about 15 pancakes. Serves 2-3.
