Here's a recipe that looks elegant enough for "Gourmet". I'm posting
it here in "Cooking" as well. I'd call it "California Cuisine" as it
uses non-Oriental ingredients with both Chinese and European cooking
techniques. The potato crepes are fancy potato pancakes while the
seafood is prepared by poaching in low temperature oil, then
stir-frying++a Chinese technique. The author, Jay Harlow, says: "This
cooking method, in which the seafood is cooked first by a kind of low
temperature deep-frying, is a typical Chinese technique.  It may
appear to use a lot of oil, but most of it is drained away and can be
reused for other frying. The over all amount of oil remaining in the
dish is no more than with other stir-fried dishes." Peel the potato
and put it through a food mill or ricer. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Stir in the flour. Beat the egg and milk together, add to
the potato mixture, and stir until smooth. Heat half the oil in a
10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pout in half the potato
mixture, shaping it into a thick pancake, 8 to 9 inches in diameter.
Cook until well-browned, 2 to 3 minutes, turn and cook on the other
side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with
remaining oil and batter. Makes 2 crepes. From the San Francisco
Chronicle, 2/13/91. Posted by Stephen Ceideburg; March 7 1991.
