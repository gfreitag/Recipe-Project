Title: POTATO-VEGETABLE CHOWDER
Categories: Vegetarian, Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
5 c  Vegetable broth (water is
-fine, but not as tasty)
1 c  Tomato or vegetable juice
1 c  Tomatoes; peeled, cut in
-small pieces
1 c  Carrots; chopped
1 c  Green beans or yellow wax
-beans
1 c  Onions; finely chopped
1 c  Zucchini or yellow squash;
-thinly sliced
1 c  Leek; chopped
2 c  Potatoes, red; diced
1    Cheesecloth bag of fresh
-herbs of choice (parsley,
-basil, etc.)
2 ts Salt
Bring liquid to boil in a deep soup kettle. Add all vegetables and
seasonings. Turn down heat to simmer and partially cover the pot.
Simmer until vegetables are tender. Serve hot with crusty whole wheat
bread and a light fruit dessert.

Variation: Almost any vegetable but onions, tomatoes, and the
potatoes can be substituted for another vegetable. Don't use the
cabbage family because the flavor is too radically changed. Green
peas and baby lima beans are a great addition, as are corn kernels
(about 1/2 cup).
