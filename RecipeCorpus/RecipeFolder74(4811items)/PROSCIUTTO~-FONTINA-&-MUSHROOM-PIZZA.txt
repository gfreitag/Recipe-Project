Title: PROSCIUTTO~ FONTINA & MUSHROOM PIZZA
Categories: Appetizers, Italian/tus, Main dishes, Pizza
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Pizza Dough Martha Stewart
8 oz Shiitake or oyster
Mushrooms
1 tb Olive oil
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper
Cornmeal for dusting
4 oz Prosciutto
8 oz Fontina cheese -- grated
Heat oven to 450#161#F. Heat a pizza stone in oven for at least 30
minutes, or preheat a large baking sheet for 15 minutes.

Heat grill until very hot. Meanwhile, trim stems from mushrooms. Place
mushrooms in bowl and sprinkle with oil, salt, and pepper. Toss well
to coat. Grill mushrooms until soft and juicy looking, about 2 to 3
minutes on each side. If you aren't using a grill, heat oil in a
medium skillet over medium-high heat and saute mushrooms until soft,
about 3 to 4 minutes.

Place discs of dough on a lightly floured surface and gently roll out
or stretch into 1/4-inch-thick circles
7    inches in diameter.

Place one circle of dough on a wooden pizza peel that has been dusted
with cornmeal (or use a large spatula). Arrange a quarter of the
prosciutto, fontina and grilled mushrooms on top.

Slide dough onto hot pizza stone or baking sheet and bake until crust
is brown and cheese is bubbling, 5 to 8 minutes. Cut pizza into six
pieces and serve immediately. Repeat process three times with
remaining dough, mushrooms, prosciutto and cheese.
