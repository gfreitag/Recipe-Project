The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when
you're faced with yet another turkey to fix. One is from the US, the
rest are from other parts of the world. The Argentine Creole Stuffing
looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to stuff and
cook a turkey.

Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds
richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts
this stuffing out of the ordinary.

Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,
pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients
and mix well.
