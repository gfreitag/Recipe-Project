Title: ROCKY ROAD BROWNIES
Categories: Chocolate, Brownies, Nuts
Yield: 12 Servings
1 3/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
3 lg Eggs
4    Squares unsweetened
-chocolate; melted, cooled
2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder;
-preferably Dutch
-processed
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Milk chocolate chips
1 c  Chopped walnuts
12    Marshmallows
Put rack in center of oven and heat to 350~. Generously grease 9x13
inch pan.  Coat with flour, tapping out the excess. Use mixer to
cream sugar and butter until fluffy. Add eggs and mix until thick and
lemon colored, about 2 minutes. Mix in chocolate and vanilla. Add
cocoa, flour and salt. Slowly mix in batter until combined. Stir in
chips and walnuts. Lay marshmallows sideways in prepared pan,
allowing 1 1/2 inch border around the inside edge of the pan and
spacing them evenly. Spoon batter (it's very thick) over marshmallows
to hide them as much as possible. Evenly fill in center of pan with
remaining batter, not adding batter to space between marshmallows and
sides of pan (batter will spread during baking and reach sides). Bake
until toothpick inserted into center comes out moist from melted
chocolate (not batter), 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely on
rack. Cut into 12 squares. Refrigerate until chilled. Use wide metal
spatula to carefully transfer brownies to serving platter. Wrap
airtight. Can be made a day in advance and refrigerated or frozen up
to 3 months. Serve chilled or at room temperature. 1:59 PM
