Combine the cornmeal, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, salt, and basil.
Trim the pork chops of all visible fat, pat them dry, and dredge in
the cornmeal mixture. Heat a skillet over medium heat, and add the
oil. When the oil is hot, place the chops in the skillet, and reduce
the heat to low. Fry the chops for 10 minutes on each side. Then add
the onions, garlic, fennel, and continue frying for another 10
minutes, turning as necessary to keep from sticking.  Makes 4
servings.
