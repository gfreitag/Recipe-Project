Title: PORK TENDERLOIN SUPREME
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Pork Tenderloin
12    Slices bacon
6    Slices of an onion
6    Slices - thick tomatoe
Salt
Pepper
Cut the tenderloin into 6 medallions, (I cut it on an angle to make
the circumfrence wider)  Cross 2 slices of bacon and put pork in the
middle. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on it. then lay the tomatoe on
top of that. more salt and pepper. then the onion, more salt and
pepper. Bring up the sides of the bacon and secure with a toothpick
or skewer. Put the 6 bundles in a 13 x 9 baking pan and cover with
aluminum foil. Bake at 350F for 30 min.  Uncover and bake 30 more min.

I served spanish rice and green beens almondine (Birds Eye frozen
:) )

It was so good and easy to make I cant wait for dinner tonight -
leftovers.

Now this was pretty greasy so next time I make it I'm going to try
smoked turkey bacon.  Hope its as good.

Well enjoy it!!!!!
