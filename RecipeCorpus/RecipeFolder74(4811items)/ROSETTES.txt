Title: ROSETTES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 36 Servings
2    Eggs
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Milk
1 c  Flour
Beat eggs.  Add sugar.  Add milk and flour alternately. Heat iron in
oil preheated to about 350F. Dip heated iron up to 3/4 depth of iron
in batter. Quickly immerse in oil.  Rosette will release from iron.
Turn over. Remove when delicately browned. Drain on paper towel. Dip
in granulated sugar.

Hints:  May need to add more flour if batter slips off iron. Make
sure iron is sufficiently hot.
