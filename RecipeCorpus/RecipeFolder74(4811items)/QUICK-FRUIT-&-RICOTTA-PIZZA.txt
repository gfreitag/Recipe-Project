Unroll dough and press evenly into an oiled 14-inch pizza pan (or
10-by 15 inch pan). Bake on bottom rack in a 425 degree oven until
crust is well browned, about 8 minutes. Cut enough prosciutto into
1/4-inch strips to make 1/4 cup; set remainder aside. Mix ricotta and
peel; drop in 1 tablespoon portions over crust. Arrange nectarines,
grapes, and prosciutto strips on crust. Combine sugar and cinnamon;
sprinkle over pizza. Bake until fruit is hot to touch, about 5
minutes longer. Accompany with remaining prosciutto. Cut into wedges.

COMMENTS: A ready-to-cook refrigerated pizza crust, the base for the
breakfast pastry, makes morning baking a snap. In addition to the
fruit pastry, offer more fresh grapes and nectarines for munching.
