Title: PRAWNS NEW ORLEANS
Categories: Main dish, Barry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Large prawns, raw or cooked
2 tb Vegetable oil
1    Clove Garlic, chopped
1    Spanish onion, peeled and
-chopped
1    Red and green pepper,
-de-seeded and chopped
8 oz Okra, chopped
8 oz Chopped Italian Style
-tomatoes, fresh or tinned
1/2 ts Each cayenne pepper and
-all spice
Salt and pepper
Clean, peel and chop into quarter-inch dice the peppers, onion and the
okra. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry hr garlic with the onion,
peppers and okra for about five minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook it
gently for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally until you have a
nice bright sauce. It looks lovely as it is full of different colours.

Season generously with allspice, cayenne pepper, the salt and the
black pepper.

Add thr prawns. If they are raw, cook for seven minutes. If they are
already cooked and pink give them just three minutes to heat them
through - otherwise you will end up with a pound of india rubber!

Stir so the prawns are covered in the sauce, sprinkle with a little
parsley and serve immeadiately with lots of boiled rice.
