Recipe by: McDougall Plan Mix vinegar, mustard, and tarragon. Pour
over the cooked rice. Mix well. If rice is warm, let cool to room
temperature before adding remaining ingredients. When rice is cool,
add remaining ingredients. Toss gently. Cover and refrigerate at
least 2 hours before serving.

HELPFUL HINTS: For a variation, substitute basil or dill weed for the
tarragon. Short-grain brown rice also may be used. Serve as a cool
main dish for a hot summer's evening, either plain or piled on
lettuce leaves and garnished with tomatoes and watercress. From the
