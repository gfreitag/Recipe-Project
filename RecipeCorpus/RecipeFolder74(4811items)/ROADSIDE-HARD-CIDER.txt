Title: ROADSIDE HARD CIDER
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ga Roadside apple juice
For those of you in apple country it is time to start seeing roadside
stands with those lovely gallon jugs of cloudy apple cider. If you do
nothing it will start fermenting at room temperature so here is the
first zero cost trick to keep it from exploding or becoming
contaminated. Replace the cap with an unopened lunch sandwich bag so
there are two layers covering the mouth.  Hold in place with a rubber
band. Puncture both layers with a pin.  Move the plastic a little so
the hole don't line up. Drink when the bubbling slows, 5-7 days.
For kick -- add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of sugar (never two unless you
like it sweet).
For consistancy -- add half a pack of dry baker's yeast. ~----
Fermenting time about the same for all three, decide by fewer
bubbles, refrigerate to keep at some level of fermentation. ~----
You can do a lot better than this but you need to get a book on
making fruit wines.  But this is how to do it with things around the
kitchen. Submitted By MGIWER@AOL.COM On MON, 30 OCT 1995 233351 -0500
