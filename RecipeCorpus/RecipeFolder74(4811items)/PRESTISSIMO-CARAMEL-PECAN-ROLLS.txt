Categories: Breads
Yield: 32 Servings
5 tb Butter or margarine
3/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Pecans -- chopped
3 tb Butter or margarine --
Softened
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Cinnamon
2    8oz cans crescent rolls
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a 13 x 9 inch baking pan, melt 5
tablespoons of butter. Stir in brown sugar, water and pecans.
Separate each can of crescent roll dough into 4 triangles, and seal
perforations. Spread with 3 tablespoon softened butter. Combine
granulated sugar and cinnamon, sprindle over buttered dough. Roll up
each triangle from the short side. Cut each roll into 4 slices.  (It
will be easier to slice if chilled.) Place in prepared pan, cut side
down. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes. Invert immediately and spoon
remaining sauce over tops of rolls. Rolls can be made and sliced the
night before and kept in refrigerator. Add "syrup" the next day.
These freeze beautifully.
