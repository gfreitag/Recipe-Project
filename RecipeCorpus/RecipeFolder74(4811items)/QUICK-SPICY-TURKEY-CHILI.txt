This is a quick recipe that produces a slightly  hot, very aromatic
chili. I liked it very much. Brown the turkey in a skillet. Transfer
to a 3 quart pot. Brown the onion in the oil (yes, in the skillet).
Transfer to the pot. Add all other ingredients except the beans to
the pot and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally,
adding a little more water if things dry out too much. Drain the
beans (or not, as you choose) and add them to the pot. Simmer another
10 minutes.
