Title: POLYNESIAN PINEAPPLE SPREAD
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Yogurt cream cheese
2 tb Crushed pineapple
1/2 c  Finely chopped dates
1 ts Shredded coconut
Mix well and chill. Spread on crackers or fill celery. Makes 2 cups.
Orginal recipe calls for 1/2 cup shredded coconut but I didn't want
to use that much. It really tasted good without the coconut but I put
in a little bit for texture.
