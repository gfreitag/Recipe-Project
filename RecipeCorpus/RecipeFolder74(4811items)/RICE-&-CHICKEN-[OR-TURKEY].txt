Categories: Poultry, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Brown Rice -- * see note
1 2/3 c  Liquid -- (water + chicken
Bro
1 ts Curry Powder
1/4 ts Red Pepper Flakes
3 sm Carrots -- sliced

(mostly white part)
1 c  Fresh Kale -- chopped
1/2 c  Fresh Mushrooms -- chopped
5 oz Cooked Chicken Or Turkey --
Chopped
2/3 c  Frozen Peas
* (use white if you prefer, but since it doesn't take as long to
cook, you may want to cook the vegetables a bit before adding the
rice.)

Put rice and liquid in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add
curry, pepper flakes, carrots, celery, leek, kale and mushrooms.
Return to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes, or
until most of the liquid is absorbed.  Add meat and peas, and cook
another 5 minutes. Serve. This served 2 very (!) hungry adults. You
could probably stretch it to 3 by adding a bit more rice and liquid
