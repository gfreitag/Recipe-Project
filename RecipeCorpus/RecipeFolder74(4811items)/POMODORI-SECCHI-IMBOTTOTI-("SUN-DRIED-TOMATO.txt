Title: POMODORI SECCHI IMBOTTOTI ("SUN-DRIED TOMATO
Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Snacks, Vegetarian
Yield: 15 Sandwiches
30 ea Sun-dried tomatoes
1 tb Olive oil
3 ts Garlic, finely minced
1/8 ts Red pepper flakes
1/4 ts Oregano
Salt & pepper
Ensure that the tomatoes are not overly salty. Refresh them in warm
water to cover for about 10 minutes. Soak them just long enough to
soften them, but be careful that they do not become soggy.  Drain &
pat dry. Warm the olive oil in a small saute pan over very low heat.
Add the garlic, red pepper flakes & oregano & warm for 5 to 8
minutes. Be careful not to let the garlic burn.  Season with salt &
pepper to taste. Make the "sandwiches" by laying one tomato face
down, drizzling a bit of the herb-infused olive oil on it & covering
with a second sun-dried tomato. Serve at room temperature.
