There are many historical references to saffron cordials made by
prolonged steeping of the spice in brandy and other alcohol. I have
been making this brandy cake for years and decided to try it with
saffron. It did not work; the saffron did not come through at all. My
tasters loved the cake, however, and suggested the saffron go in some
kind of icing instead. Great suggestion.

Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs, one at a time. Sift flour and
add it gradually.  Add remaining ingredients, mix just until
combined. Preheat oven to 375F (190C). Bake in a greased and floured
bundt or ring pan for about 50 minutes.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes,
then on cooling rack.

LEMON CREAM:

Steep saffron in lemon juice for 20 minutes.  Whisk eggs and sugar,
then add juice.  Switch to non-wooden utensil and cook cream in top
of double boiler until thick. Incorporate butter and cool before
using.
