Presented by: Zarella Martinez, L.A. Times article, "Home Ground",
10/6/94, page H16. "The ricado used in this dish is the basis for many
Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a
suckling pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana
leaves, baked in a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and
venison or other wild game are also baked in pibs. I slather this
paste on guinea hens and broil them on the rotisserie, or wrap
marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in banana leaves with
slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my favorite appetizers
is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.
"... Quintana Roo oregano comes from a tree, not a shrub, and the
long leaves turn black when they dry. Mexican oregano can be
substituted for it."
