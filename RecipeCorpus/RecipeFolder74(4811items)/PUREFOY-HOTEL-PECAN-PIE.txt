Title: PUREFOY HOTEL PECAN PIE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
6 tb Butter (NOT oleo)
3/4 c  White sugar
2 c  Pecan halves
4 lg Eggs
1 1/4 c  WHITE Karo
1    Unbaked 10" pie shell
Brown butter to golden brown in heavy skillet. Remove to bowl (not
plastic) and stir in sugar. Add syrup in thin stream and beat in.
Beat in eggs, one at a time. Toss pecans with mixture to coat. Pour
all into unbaked pie shell. Bake at 425 F for 10 min, then turn oven
down to 375 F for the rest of the cooking time -- 40-50 minutes,
depending on the depth of the pie shell.  If crust starts to become
too dark, cover entire pie with aluminum foil. Pie is done when
pecans are a rich, dark brown and the filling is completely
congealed. (Tap with finger to test for firmness.) "N.B. Never trust
any pecan pie recipe calling for all dark karo, molasses (God forbid)
or vanilla extract. All these interfere with the browned butter
flavor. Always use pecan halves, not chopped pecans."
