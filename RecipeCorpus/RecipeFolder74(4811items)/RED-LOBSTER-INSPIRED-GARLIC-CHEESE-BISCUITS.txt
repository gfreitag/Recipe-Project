Title: RED LOBSTER INSPIRED GARLIC CHEESE BISCUITS
Categories: Breads, Copycat
Yield: 10 Servings
1 c  Milk
1/3 c  Mayonnaise
1 tb Sugar**
2 c  Self-rising flour*
1/4 c  Kraft American Cheese**
1/2 ts Garlic POWDER -- not salt
3 tb Melted butter or margarine
Muffin paper liners
*You may use all-purpose (regular) flour, however biscuits will not
rise much and have a denser texture; flavors should be about
identical. **Can substitute 3 packets of Sweet & Low for the sugar.
Use the cheese in the gold cardboard container. Original recipe does
not say, but I would think you will want to shred it.

In a 1 1/2 qt mixing bowl combine the milk, mayo, sugar, and flour.
Beat on high speed with electric mixer for almost a minute, until
smooth and completely combined. Using a rubber bowl scraper, streak
the dough with the cheese. Batter should NOT be thin enough to pour;
if necessary, add only enough additional flour so batter will "drop"
from spoon. Drop batter into 10 paper-lined muffin tins, or a greater
number of tiny muffin cups. (Muffins tend to triple in size when
baked; fill lightly.) Melt butter; mix in garlic, and brush tops of
dough. You may shake 1 tsp additional cheese on each muffin if you
wish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden. Cool in pan on rack
for 30 minutes.

These definitely should be served freshly baked and hot.
