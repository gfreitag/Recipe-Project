Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a large 12 to 14-inch saute pan heat the olive oil over medium

cut side down until lightly brown on both cut sides. Set aside and
repeat with the remaining 4 quarters. Let cool.

While the pan is still hot, saute the 8 sage leaves until crisp and
brown, set aside.

In a mixing bowl stir together the goat cheese, rosemary, egg,
Parmesan and 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar until well blended.

Pack about 3 tablespoons of the cheese mixture on top of each
radicchio quarter, smoothing over to form a slightly rounded top.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until the goat cheese has started to brown
slightly. Remove from oven, sprinkle with remaining balsamic vinegar
and garnish with 2 sage leaves each. Season with salt and pepper.
Serve hot.

Yield: 4 servings as an antipasto
