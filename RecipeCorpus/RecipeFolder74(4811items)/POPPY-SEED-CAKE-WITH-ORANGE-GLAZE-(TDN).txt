Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake approximately 45 to 50 minutes,

Prepare glaze while cake is cooling:  Whisk powdered sugar, orange
juice and almond extract together in a small bowl to blend. Turn out
cake onto rack or cake platter. Spoon glaze over warm cake and allow
cake to cool completely before slicing.

Note:  This poppy seed cake, which works in low or high altitudes
without adjustment, will keep a number of days in a covered container
on the counter top and freezes well unglazed. Serve it plain for
snacking, glazed for desserts or with orange slices for breadfast.
