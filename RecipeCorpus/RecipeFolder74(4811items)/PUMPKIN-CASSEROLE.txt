Pumpkin dishes don't have to be sweet. This one is perfect with roast
pork. Hollow out a small pumpkin to serve this in for a special
presentation.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Using a paring knife or vegetable peeler, peel
and discard outer skin of the pumpkin. Slice the pumpkin into
1/4-inch slices and place in a mixing bowl. Add the onion, salt,
pepper and butter and toss well. Pour contents of the bowl into a
9-inch round or square greased baking dish, cover with foil and place
in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, beat eggs, milk and
cheese together until smooth. Remove the baking dish from the oven,
remove the cover and pour the cheese mixture over the top. Replace in
oven, uncovered, another 20 minutes. The gratin is done when it turns
golden brown.
