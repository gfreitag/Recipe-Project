Title: ROSE WATER (AND ROSE SYRUP)
Categories: Misc, Flowers
Yield: 1 Servings
Red rose petals
Water
Fill a vessel with red rose petals and cover with water. Keep water
just at the boiling point, but do not boil. After an hour remove the
petals and add more petals.  Repeat this until it has the proper
strength, then bottle. For ROSE SYRUP: Take a pint of warm rose water
and dissolve 2 pounds of fine granulated sugar in it. A Turkish
recipe recommends adding a few poppy petals and a tablespoon of lemon
juice, but it is not necessary to add these ingredients. Some purists
just like the roses and sugar. Bottle and keep in refrigerator.
