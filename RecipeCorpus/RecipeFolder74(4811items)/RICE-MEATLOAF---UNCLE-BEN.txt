Title: RICE MEATLOAF - UNCLE BEN
Categories: Beef, Pork, Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 lb Lean ground beef
3/4 lb Lean ground pork
1/2 c  Converted rice; raw
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Onion; minced
2 tb Ketchup
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
2    Eggs; slightly beaten
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/4 ts Dried marjoram
1/4 ts Dried thyme
1/4 ts Pepper
In a large bowl, mix all ingredients together until well blended.
Pack into a 9x5 (2L) loaf pan, cover with foil, and bake at 350F 180C
for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hrs (removing foil after 30 mins), or until loaf
is well-browned and meat is cooked through with an internal
temperature of 106F 70C. Even when cooked through, meat will still be
slightly pink because of the ketchup. Drain off fat, and let the
meatloaf rest for 5 minutes before slicing to serve.
