ds Cayenne pepper
6 tb Port wine
Put cheese in bowl and crumble with a fork or pastry blender. Add
butter, salt, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper; blend
well. Gradually beat in Port, then continue beating until mixture is
light and creamy. (An electric mixer is excellent here). Pack into
small jars, individual casseroles, or any small dishes with covers.
Cut a piece of waxed paper to fit and lay it over the top of the
cheese, then cover the jar or dish tightly. Store in the
refrigerator. Serve with crisp crackers as an hors d'oeuvre, dinner
finale, or salad accompaninment. NOTE: If the cheese is to be stored
for any length of time, cove the top with melted paraffin instead of
waxed paper. Jars of this cheese, make excellent gifts.
