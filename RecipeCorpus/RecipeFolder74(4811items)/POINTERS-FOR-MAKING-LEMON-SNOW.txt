+ Remember to remove the zest from the lemon before squeezing its
juice.

+ The temperature and consistency of the gelatin mixture is crucial to
achieving a fine foam that will not separate on chilling. To prevent
separation, beat only when the mixture is thick enough and mounds when
dropped from a spoon. If too thick, it will not form a fine foam. If
the gelatin mixture begins to set before beating, briefly place the
bowl over a bowl of hot water and stir constantly until gelatin
begins to soften. Set the bottom of the bowl directly in cold water
to stop the heating immediately.

+ The sauce mixture must be heated to at least 160 degrees to thicken
and prevent thinning out on setting. However, for a silky- smooth
sauce that does not curdle, the mixture must not be allowed to boil.
