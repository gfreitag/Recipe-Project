Title: POTATO & APPLE PUDDING (IRISH)
Categories: Fruits, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Butter
8 oz Self-raising flour
6 oz Freshly mashed potatoes
4 tb Milk
5 x  Med. cooking apples
Brown or white sugar
2 x  Whole cloves
Juice of 1/2 lemon
3 tb Cider
Mix the butter into the hot mashed potatoes, add a good pinch of
salt, and the flour, and mix well, then add enough milk to make a
soft, slack dough. Roll out and line a 1-qt bowl with some of it,
reserving enough for the lid.  Fill with the apples, peeled and cored
and finely sliced, and sweeten to taste with sugar. Add 2 whole
cloves, the lemon juice and the cider (or water), taking care not to
make it too wet.  Dampen the pastry edges, lay the lid on and press
down. Cover with foil and secure well. Steam, or cook set in boiling
water up to the rim, for 2 ~ 2 1/2 hours. Serve cut in wedges with
cream or home-made custard.
