Title: POTATO POBLANO SOUP
Categories: Soups, Mexican
Yield: 6 To 8 serv
2    Strips bacon, cut into
1/2-inch wide pieces
1 md Onion, chopped
4    Poblano chiles, roasted,
Seeded, peeled and diced
2 t  Salt
1 t  Fresh black pepper
3    Garlic cloves, minced
1 qt Chicken stock
6 md Yukon Gold potatoes
.or 8-10 small red new
.potatoes, unpeeled, chopped
1 c  Crema, Creme Fraiche or
.sour cream
1/2 c  Grated Anejo cheese
(optional)
In a heavy Dutch oven or stockpot, fry the bacon over moderate heat,
stirring frequently, until it starts to brown. Toss in the onions,
half of the diced Poblanos, the salt and pepper and cook until
slightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon out any excess fat. Stir in
the garlic and cook briefly just to release the aroma, 1 to 2
minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, add the potatoes and bring to a
boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook 20 minutes. Puree in a food
processor or blender just until smooth, being careful not to
over-process. Over-working will result in a gummy soup. Return to the
pot, stir in the Crema, Creme Fraiche or sour cream and bring just to
a boil. Stir in the remaining Poblanos for garnish. Sprinkle with
grated Anejo, if desired, and serve hot. Yield: 6-8 servings
