Categories: Desserts, Thai, Rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Rice flour
1/2 c  Arrowroot
3 c  Coconut milk
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
Mix the rice flour, arrowroot & 1/4 c cold water. Turn the mixture
out onto a smooth surface & knead it to the consistency of a pie
crust. Add more water if needed. Shape into 1 1/2" balls. Fill a
large pot half full with water & bring to a boil.  Drop the balls
into the boiling water, four at a time.  Boil for 4 to 5 minutes or
until they float to the top. Cook the rest of the balls this way. In
a large pot, heat the coconut milk, sugar, salt & vanilla over medium
heat for 5 to 7 minutes. Add the rice balls & cook, stirring
constantly, until the milk starts to boil. Serve hot.
