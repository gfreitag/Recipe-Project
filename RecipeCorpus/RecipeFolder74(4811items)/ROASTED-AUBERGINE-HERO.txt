Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt and mustard. Refrigerate
until ready to use.

On a large parchment-lined nonstick baking sheet, place the eggplant,
green pepper, tomato, onion, and mushroom slices in a single layer.
(It may be necessary to use 2 sheets.)  Roast the vegetables for 30
minutes, or until tender but not dry.

Slice the baguette lengthwise and spread each side with the yogurt and
mustard mixture.  Layer the roasted vegetables over the spread on
half of the baguette. Lightly salt to taste. Cover with the second
half of the baguette and cut the loaf into 4 6" sandwiches.

*Note*  If youlike, roast as many garlic cloves as you wish on the
same baking sheet as the eggplant.  Once the garlic has softened,
squeeze it out of its skin, and spread it over the baguette before
the dressing. These sandwiches are great for a picnic or at a
tailgate party.
