-----cinnamon sugar topping-
1 1/2 tb Sugar; mixed with
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 13-by-9-by-2-inch baking pan
with non-stick vegetable spray and set aside. Churn orange zest and
sugar in food processor 30 seconds, scrape bowl sides down, and churn
30 seconds more until zest is finely grated. Add flour, soda, baking
powder, cinnamon and nutmeg and pulse 10 to 12 times to combine.
Transfer to large mixing bowl and make well in center. Buzz
buttermilk, carrots, molasses and lemon juice in processor 5 seconds.
Add egg substitute and ginger and pulse 3 to 4 times. Dump carrot
mixture into well in dry ingredients and with large rubber spatula,
fold in as gently as you would beaten egg whites. Batter should be
lumpy, no matter if a few dry flecks show. They will vanish during
baking. Don't overmix or cake will be tough. Spoon batter into
prepared pan, spreading to corners and smoothing top. Sprinkle evenly
with cinnamon-sugar. Bake 35 to 40 minutes until cake is springy to
touch and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cake
to room temperature in upright pan on wire rack, then cut into 24
bars (two cuts lengthwise the pan and seven crosswise.)
