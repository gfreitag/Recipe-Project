Take 4 sheets of phyllo pastry, keeping remaining sheets covered with
a damp towel.  Brush each sheet with melted butter and lay one on top
of the other. Mix walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. Sprinkle some
of the mixture evenly over the top buttered sheet and set the pieces
upright in a large buttered pan. Continue, using another 4 buttered
sheets of phyllo, sprinkling with nut mixture, rolling and cutting,
until the pan or pans are full and all the nut mixture is used. Spoon
about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each piece, and continue baking
for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from oven and dip
each piece into cold thick syrup. Drain on cake racks. Syrup: In a
saucepan, combine granulated sugar, water, lemon juice and small jar
of honey.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes, removing scum
as it rises to the surface.
