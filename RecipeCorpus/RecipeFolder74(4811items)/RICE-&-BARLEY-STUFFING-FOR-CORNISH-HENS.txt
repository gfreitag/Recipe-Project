Title: RICE & BARLEY STUFFING FOR CORNISH HENS
Categories: Side dish, Poultry, Seasonings
Yield: 4 Henfuls :)
1/2 c  Rice
2 tb Butter
2 1/4 c  Water (or more)
2    Chicken broth cubes
1/3 c  Barley
8 oz Cranberries, fresh; OR...
16 oz -Canned cranberry sauce
-- with gel rinsed off
Sugar
- if using fresh cranberries
2 ts Bitter orange marmalade
-- (heaping measure), OR...
-- half marmalade -and-
-- half diced orange peel
2 tb Orange juice
1/3 c  Raisins
2 ts Rubbed sage
2 ts Tarragon
1/2 ts Sweet marjoram
1 ts Crushed rosemary
Salt and pepper; to taste
Brown the rice in the butter, then add 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups water and
chicken cube; cook until soft.

Cook barley in 1 cup water and second chicken cube for
45    minutes, or until tender.

If using fresh cranberries, cook briefly with a little sugar to soften
somewhat and create a little juice.

Mix the remaining ingredients with the cooked rice and barley. Stuff
the Cornish hens and cook according to instructions on package. I
like to brush the stuffed birds with melted butter and sprinkle with
salt, pepper, crushed basil, and tarragon.

The stuffing may be frozen for future use.

VARIATION: Substitute sliced mushrooms for the raisins.
