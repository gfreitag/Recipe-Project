Title: RICE WITH PESTO SAUCE
Categories: Grains
Yield: 2 Servings
150 g  Long-grain rice; washed
1 tb Sunflower oil
3 tb Pesto sauce
Salt and pepper
Grated Gruyre
Serves 2-3

Quick, cheap and easy - this recipe fits all those bills! It is
deceptively good, too, for all its simplicity. Serve it with a tossed
salad and some warm granary rolls.

Put the rice into a large saucepan of boiling salted water, add the
oil (to prevent it sticking) and simmer for about 8-10 minutes, until
well cooked. Drain and pile into a serving-dish. Spoon the pesto
sauce over the top, stir in well and season to taste. Serve with a
bowl of finely grated Gruyre to sprinkle over it.
