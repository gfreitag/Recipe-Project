Title: RACLETTE (SWISS MELTED CHEESE WITH POTATOES &
Categories: Appetizers, Swiss
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Swiss raclette cheese
4 sm New potatoes
4 sm Sour gherkins; up to 8
4    Pickled onions; up to 8
Cut cheese into 16 slices, each approximately 1/8 inch thick, 5
inches long and 2 inches wide. Boil potatoes just before use, peel
and keep hot.

Preheat the oven to 500'F for at least 15 minutes. Heat four 10-inch
ovenproof dinner plates in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. To ensure the
success of the raclette, the plates must be very hot.

When redy to serve, remove the plates from the oven, grasping them
with potholders, and, as quickly as you can, arrange four slices of
the cheese in the center of each plate, overlapping them slightly.
The cheese should begin to sizzle as soon as it comes in contact with
the plate. At once, place the four plates on the floor of the oven
(if you are using an electric oven, place the plates on a rack set in
the first slot above the source of heat). In about 2 minutes (5 to 6
minutes in an electric oven) the cheese should melt to a creamy,
bubbly mass; do not let it turn the slightest bit brown. Remove from
the oven, place a potato and one or two gherkins and pickled onions
on the side of each plate and serve at once, setting each plate on a
service plate to prevent it from scorching the table.

NOTE: Swiss diners often consume at least 2 to 3 plates of raclette in
succession at one sitting. Should you want to do the same, double or
triple all the ingredients and have two or three sets of dinner
plates heating in the oven while the first batch of raclette is being
eaten.
