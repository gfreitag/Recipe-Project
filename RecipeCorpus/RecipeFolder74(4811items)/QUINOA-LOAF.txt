Title: QUINOA LOAF
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 c  Quinoa
1 c  -Water
3/16 ts Sea salt
2/3 tb Olive oil
2/3 c  Finely diced celery
3/16 c  Finely diced fennel
1/3 c  Finely diced onions
1 1/3 ts Minced garlic
3/16 c  Finely diced red bell pepper
1/3 ts Sea salt
2/3 tb Sesame seeds
1/2 c  Cooked pinto beans
1 1/3 tb Tahini
1 1/3 tb Whole wheat flour
-(stone-ground)
1 1/3 tb Gluten flour
Place the quinoa in a medium saucepan along with the water and 1/2
teaspoon salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until all the
water has evaporated (about 15 minutes). Set aside.

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute the celery, fennel, onions,
garlic, and bell pepper, along with the salt, marjoram, and cardamom,
for about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Add the
cooked quinoa and the sesame seeds, pinto beans, and tahini to the
sauteed vegetables.  Blend the ingredients.

Mix the two flours together and blend into the vegetable and quinoa
mixture. Line a large loaf pan with a baking sheet liner and lightly
oil the liner. (In lieu of the baking sheet liner, you could just oil
and flour the pan.)  Press the mixture into the pan. Bake at 400
degrees F for about 45 minutes.  (The loaf should reach an internal
temperature of 180-200 degrees F.)  Let the loaf cool, inverted, for
10 minutes before removing it from the pan.  Serve the loaf in
slices, with your favorite tomato (or other) sauce if desired.
