Prepare jello according to package directions. Pour into shallow pan
and chill until firm, about 3 hours.

Using a dull knife, make as many cuts as possible across the length
and width, forming tiny cubes.

With an adult's help, grind ice cubes in a blender.

Spoon alternating layers of crushed ice and gelatin pieces into tall
glasses, filling them about 2" away from tops. Slowly pour soda into
each glass unti lfull, then stir gently. Serve retch with ice tea
spoons, so your guests can get at every chilly glob

Sicko serving suggestion: Almost any cooked food can look like puke
if you grind it for a few seconds in a blender. And it makes for a
tasty sandwich spread!)
