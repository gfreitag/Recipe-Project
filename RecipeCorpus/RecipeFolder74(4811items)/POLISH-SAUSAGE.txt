Title: POLISH SAUSAGE
Categories: Meats, Polish
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Pork butt or shoulder
2 ts Salt
Black pepper to taste
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/4 ts Dried basil
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Mustard seeds
1/2 ts Dried marjoram
1/3 c  Plus 1 tsp ice-cold water
Cut pork into 1 1/2 " cubes, trimming all gristle and bone. Pass
through a meat grinder with a coarse blade. Adjust the fat-to-lean
ratio to be about 1:3 if you can. Put pork in a large stainless or
ceramic crock or bowl. Mix the dry spices in a small bowl. Using your
hands, toss the meat while adding the spices a small amount at a
time. When half the spices are in, add half the ice water. Mix
keeping the meat as loose as possible. Add remaining spices & water
as above. At this point you may fry a small patty of the meat to test
for seasonings. Adjust if necessary. Refrigerate the sausage mix
overnight. You may check for seasonings again the next day (but be
careful! You'll be tempted to fry it all right then and eat it up!)
Stuff the mix into about 5' of rinsed casings, tying off about 8"
lengths. You may grill, steam or fry the sausages as you prefer.
