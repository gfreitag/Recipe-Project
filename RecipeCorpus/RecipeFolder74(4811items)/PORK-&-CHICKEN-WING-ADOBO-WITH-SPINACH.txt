There are many ways of preparing adobo.  In this recipe, the sauce is
reduced to a rich savory glaze to coat the pork and chicken.

Cut chicken wings between the joints.  Remove tips and save for
stock. Trim fat from pork.  Cut meat into 1-inch cubes.

Combine the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, shallots, pepper, salt and bay
leaves in a non aluminum saucepan; add wings and pork, toss well to
coat and let marinate for 1 to 3 hours.

Add the water to the saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer for 20 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken and
set aside. Let pork cook for 20 minutes longer. Remove the pork.

Reduce the sauce over high heat to about 1 cup; strain into a bowl.
Spoon off fat.

Heat the oil in a skillet; add chicken and pork and saute until nicely
browned.

Heat the sauce, then combine with chicken and pork. Serve hot on a
bed of blanched spin- spinach and steamed rice.

Makes 4 servings.
