Remove the roots and stems from spinach and save for later use. Rinse
spinach in cold water as many times as necessary to rid it of any
sand. Place in a pot with no water other than the water the spinach
retains from washing. Add a pinch of salt and cook, covered for about
5 minutes. Transfer to a colander and set aside to drain.
Place oil, onion, carrot and chicken breast in a large skillet. Add
1 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and cook over moderate heat for 4 to 5
minutes longer or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add flour
and stir 1 more minute. Remove from heat; cool for 5 or 6 minutes,
then chop very fine.
Roll the dough paper thin and place over a floured board. With a
feather brush dipped in cold water lightly brush the top to maintain
moisture. Place mounds of spinach mixture on the dough in straight
lines about 2 inches apart (measurements are from the centers of the
mounds), making 8 or 9 dozen of them. Roll out the other half of the
dough paper thin and place loosely over the sheet with the mounds.
With an Italian pastry wheel, press along the furrows, cutting and
sealing at the same time.
Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add ravioli and 3 Tbsp salt. Stir
until boiling resumes. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, uncovered. Drain and
serve with marinara or meat sauce. SERVES: 6-8
