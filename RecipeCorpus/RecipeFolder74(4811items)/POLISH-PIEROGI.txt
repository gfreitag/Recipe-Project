minutes.

Potato Filling: Prepare potatoes, set aside.

Assembly:  Divide dough into three parts.  On a floured surface roll
dough to about 1/8-inch thick; cut into 3-inch rounds. Place a small
spoonful of the filling in the center of each round, fold and press
the edges together firmly to seal.

Drop the pierogi in simmering chicken bouillon with 1 teaspoon of
oil. Do not crowd.  Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring gently to prevent
sticking. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well.

Place the drained pierogi in a casserole and pour sauce mixture over
all. Garnish with mushrooms.
