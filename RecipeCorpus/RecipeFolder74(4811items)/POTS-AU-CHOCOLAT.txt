Categories: Desserts
Yield: 3 Servings

75 ml Double cream

This recipe is a hit. Dark, velvety chocolate pots that melt in the
mouth and flavours that linger on the palate. Truly delicious.

Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over simmering water. In a heavy
saucepan combine the cream, milk and 2 tbs of the sugar. Bring to the
boil, stirring. In a small bowl combine 2 tbs of milk with the coffee
powder and stir into the milk mixture with the chocolate.

Beat the egg yolks with a whole egg and the remaining sugar until well
blended. Add the milk mixture in a stream, whisking all the time.
Pour into three ramekin dishes and set in a pan of water. Cover with
foil and bake at 170 degrees C / 325 degrees F / gas 3 for 20-25
minutes or until just set. Remove and cool for 5 minutes. Uncover and
cool completely. Chill for at least 3 hours or overnight. Garnish
with a dollop of cream just before serving.
