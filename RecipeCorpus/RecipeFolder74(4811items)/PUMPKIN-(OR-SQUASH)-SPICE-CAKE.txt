MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Pumpkin; sieved and cooked
Or winter squash
2 c  Cake flour; sifted
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Ginger
1/2 c  Buttermilk or sour milk
(or stir 1 1/2 tsp vinegar
-into 1/2 cup sweet milk and
-allow to stand 10 minutes)
1/2 c  Nuts; chopped and toasted
-(walnuts, pecans, filberts)
MMMMM----------------------CARAMEL FROSTING---------------------------
2 c  Dark brown sugar; firmly
-packed
1 1/3 c  Light cream
3 tb Butter
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla
In a mixing bowl, cream the butter well, then cream in the sugar until
fluffy.  Beat in the eggs and the pumpkin. Sift the dry ingredients
together and stir in alternately with the milk. If using an electric
mixer, add the dry ingredients and milk and turn to lowest speed;
push down the batter from the sides of the bowl with a rubber
spatula, and mix just until the batter is smooth. Add the nuts and
turn into a greased and floured sheet cake pan 11x14x2 inches or two
8 or 9-inch layer cake pans, greased and floured. Bake in a preheated
350 degree F. oven about 35 minutes for a sheet cake or 25 for
layers, or until the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the
center. Cool 5 minutes on a rack, loosen from the pan, and turn out
onto the rack to cool. Frost with Caramel Frosting.

FROSTING: In a saucepan over low heat, bring the sugar and cream to a
boil. Cover the pan and cook the mixture 3 minutes. Remove the cover
and continue cooking until the mixture reaches 236 to 240 degrees.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, salt, and
vanilla. Cool to lukewarm, then beat until the mixture is creamy
smooth and of spreading consistency. This recipe provides sufficient
frosting for a 9-inch two-layer cake or the equivalent. Source: James
