Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Onion; diced
5 c  Homemade chicken stock
-- well seasoned
2 1/2 c  Pumpkin puree
-- canned or fresh*
Salt and nutmeg; to taste
Cayenne pepper; to taste
2 c  Light cream
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
Whipped cream (opt'l.)
Fresh chives; chopped
MMMMM------------------------PRESENTATION-----------------------------
Hollowed-out pumpkin shell
-plus lid (opt'l.)
*If using fresh pumpkin:  Wash, halve and scrape out seeds and fiber.
Peel and cube.  Cook, covered, in boiling water until tender (about
25 minutes). Mash in blender or by hand and let drain in strainer for
30 minutes. You'll need about 5 cups of cubed fresh pumpkin to yield
enough cooked puree. If you plan to use the pumpkin shell as the soup
tureen, cook all the cubed pumpkin, saving any leftover puree for use
in pies, breads or muffins.

To make the soup:  Cook diced onion with stock in a large saucepan for
about 10 minutes.  Add pumpkin puree and seasonings. Process in
blender or food processor until smooth. Return to saucepan. Add cream
and heat through, but do not allow to boil. Taste and adjust
seasonings.

Ladle into pumpkin shell if desired, replace lid, and ladle into
individual bowls at the table.  Garnish each with a dollop of whipped
cream and sprinkle with chopped chives.
