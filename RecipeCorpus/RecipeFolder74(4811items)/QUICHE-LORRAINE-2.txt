Title: QUICHE LORRAINE 2
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
Pate Brisee
1    Egg White
1/4 lb Bacon
2 c  Cream
3    Eggs
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts White Pepper, Ground
Nutmeg, Grated
1 ts Chives, Chopped
1/2 c  Swiss Cheese, Diced
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the baking pan with the Pate
Brisee to form the shell. Brush with the egg white and prick it
thoroughly. Chop the bacon into 1" lengths and cook, stirring
constantly, until the fat is almost all rendered out but the bacon
isn't quite crisp. Drain the bacon on paper toweling. Scald the
cream, then cool. Combine the eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg and chives
in the cream. Sprinkle the bacon and the Swiss cheese in the bottom
of the shell. Pour the batter into the shell. Bake until the top is
golden brown (you may test as for a custard) (about 35 or 40 minutes).
