Title: RISOTTO OF SWEET SAUSAGE & BROCCOLI RAAB
Categories: Italian, Rice
Yield: 2 Servings
3 c  Chicken stock; more if
-needed
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Arborio rice, about 2 cups
1/4 lb Sweet Italian sausage;
-skinned, crumbled
1    Garlic; chopped
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Salt to taste
pn Cayenne pepper
1/4 lb Broccoli raab; drained,
-squeezed, and
Cont'd; coarsely chopped
Black pepper; freshly ground
2 tb Parmigiano-reggiano; freshly
- grated
Bring the stock to a boil; lower the heat to a simmer.  In a large,
heavy gauge saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Stir in the
rice, toasting just until it starts to sizzle and pop, about 1
minute.  It should not color.  Add the sausage and garlic.  Stir,
breaking up the meat into small bits, until the sausage has lost its
pink color, about 1 minute.

Pour in the wine.  Stir occasionally, cooking until the liquid is
almost gone, about 2 minutes.  Add just enough hot stock to cover the
rice. Lower the heat to maintain a vigorous simmer; stir
occasionally.  When the liquid is almost gone, add just enough hot
stock to cover the rice, along with a pinch of salt and cayenne.
Check the risotto every 3 or 4 minutes, giving it an additional stir
to make sure it isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan and adding
just enough stock to cover the rice when the liquid has almost
disappeared.  After  a couple of additions of stock, add the broccoli
raab.  Continue adding stock and checking until the rice is just al
dente, about 20 minutes total cooking time.  Bite into a grain; you
should see a small white pin-dot in the center.  Take the risotto off
the heat and stir vigorously for a few seconds.  Fold in the pepper,
cheese, and a pinch of salt if needed.  Stir in a few tablespoons of
stock to loosen the risotto, if you like.  serve immediately.
