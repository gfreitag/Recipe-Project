Title: RAGOUT DE PORC - PORK STEW
Categories: Pork, Stew
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 lb Pork (Boston Butt), trimmed
And cut into cubes
1 lg Onion, chopped
1 lg Carrot, chopped
1    Rib of celery, chopped
8    Garlic cloves, chopped
3 c  Red wine
1    Bouquet garni*
ds Salt to taste
ds Pepper to taste
1 1/2 c  Stock (veal, or beef, or
Chicken)
*Bouquet garni is one bayleaf plus spring of thyme and parsley tied
together.

In a large skillet or saute pan heat vegetable oil and brown the meat
chunks in several batches, adding more oil as needed. Do not crowd
the pan. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.

Add the vegetables and cook until lightly browned - if necessary add
more oil.  Add the red wine to the pan deglazing it by scraping up
the browned bits.  Add the bouquet garni and salt and pepper to
taste. Return the browned meat to the pan.  Simmer covered slowly for
one hour and then add the stock. Uncover the pan and increase the
heat and let reduce for 1/2 hour. Towards the end of the cooking time
remove the meat and let the liquid reduce to a sauce like
consistency. Defat the sauce and return the meat to the pan just to
reheat.

Drain meat when hot and remove to a serving dish. Strain the pan
sauce, adjust the seasonings and pour sauce over the meat.

Serve with mashed potatoes and green salad
