Title: PORK SCALOPPINE WITH MARSALA & MUSHROOMS
Categories: Pork, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Pork tenderloin; cut into
-slices 1/4 to 1/2" thick
Flour
6 tb Clarified butter
6 lg Mushroom; thinly sliced
1    Shallot; minced
2/3 c  Marsala
1/3 c  Chicken stock
2 tb Butter, unsalted; cut into
-pieces
Salt & pepper
Place the pork slices between two sheets of plastic wrap. Flatten each
piece to thickness of about 3/16". Dip the slices lightly in flour,
shaking off the excess.

Preheat the oven to 200 F. Heat half the clarified butter in a heavy
large skillet over medium-high heat until it is hot but not brown.
Add the pork to the skillet in batches so their sides do not touch
and saut them until golden, about two to three minutes per side; add
butter as needed. Transfer to a platter and keep warm in the oven.
Pour off all but about two tablespoons of butter from the skillet.
Place over high heat, and add the mushrooms and shallot. Saut until
they begin to color. Blend in the Marsala and stock.

Boil over high heat, scraping up any browned bits clinging to bottom
of pan, until reduced by half. Remove from heat and add remaining
butter, swirling until it is well blended and the sauce is slightly
thickened. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Pour over the pork
and serve.
