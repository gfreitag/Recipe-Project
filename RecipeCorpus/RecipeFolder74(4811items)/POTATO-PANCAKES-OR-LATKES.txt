Title: POTATO PANCAKES OR LATKES
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
6 md Russet potatoes (white will
-do in a pinch)
Salt
1 sm Onion, diced
2    Eggs
1/3 c  Flour
Salt & pepper to taste
Oil
Peel and grate the potatoes into a large bowl.  Fill the large bowl
with cold water.  Let the potatoes soak for 10-15 minutes, swishing
them occasionally.  Drain. Refill with cold, salted water (not too
much, and you don't need the salt if you are sodium-restricted). Soak
for another 5-10 minutes.  Drain in a colander. Drain a long time.
Press them out, wait, and press more. Toss them around. Press some
more (you get the picture).

Put the potatoes in the bowl with the diced onion, the eggs and the
flour, mix together, and salt & pepper to taste.

Heat about 1/4" of oil in a large skillet or electric frying pan to
around 350F.  Spoon about 1/2 c. of the potato mixture into the hot
oil, spreading it out with the back of a pancake turner. Cook until
brown on the bottom (3-4 minutes?); turn and cook until golden brown.
Drain on paper towels.

Enjoy!
