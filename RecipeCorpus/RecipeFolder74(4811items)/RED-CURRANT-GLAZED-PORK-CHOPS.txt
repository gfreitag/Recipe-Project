Title: RED CURRANT-GLAZED PORK CHOPS
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Pork loin chops; about 4 oz.
3/4 ts Rubbed sage
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Vegetable spray; (e.g. pam)
1/4 c  Red currant jelly
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
Recipe by: Kelly Day Rubenstein <KDAY@ERS.BITNET> Trim fat from chops.
Sprinkle with sage, pepper and salt on both sides of chops. Coat a
non-stick skillet with cooking spray, place over medium heat until hot
(provided your cookware allows this - mine doesn't so I put the chops
in cold.)  Add chops, and cook for 7 minutes on each side, until
done. Remove chops, keep warm.

Add jelly and vinegar to skillet and cook until thickened (about 2
mintues), stirring constantly. Spoon over chops.

Note: being paranoid about food-borne illness, I kept the chops in the
skillet while making the sauce (extra cooking time). They still
turned out great
