Title: ROASTED PEANUTS - DAU PHONG RANG
Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Raw peanuts
Use shelled and skinned unsalted peanuts for this purpose. Cook a
small amount at a time and use shortly after they are roasted to
preserve their flavor. Amounts are specified in recipes using roasted
peanuts.

Place the peanuts in a skillet over moderate heat and cook, stirring
constantly, until the nuts turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Allow
to cool. Pound in a mortar with a pestle or pro- cess in a spice
grinder until the peanuts are a bit chunky.

Store-bought dry-roasted unsalted peanuts may be substituted in
recipes calling for roasted peanuts.
