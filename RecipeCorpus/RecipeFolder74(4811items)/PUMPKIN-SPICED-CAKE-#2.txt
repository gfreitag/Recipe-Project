Title: PUMPKIN SPICED CAKE #2
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
8 tb Butter, softened
1 c  Brown sugar
2 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
2    Eggs
1/3 ts Baking soda
3/4 c  Buttermilk
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/3 ts Ground allspice
1/3 ts Ground ginger
1 3/4 c  Pumpkin puree
2/3 c  Pecans, finely chopped
1 c  Heavy cream
1 ts Confectioners sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
Cream the butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. Add
the eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition. Sift the
flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, and
ginger together twice. Add the sifted flour and spices to the egg
mixture, then add the buttermilk and mix well. Add the pureed pumpkin
and the chopped pecans and blend thoroughly, scraping the sides and
bottom of the bowl to ensure proper mixing.  Divide the batter
equally between two buttered and floured layer-cake pans and bake in
a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 25 minutes, or until a
tester inserted through the center comes out clean. Cool the layers
for 10 minutes. Remove them from the pans and place them in the
refrigerator for 45 minutes, or until cold. Whip the cream, vanilla
extract and confectioners sugar together until peaks form. Place
first layer of cake on cake platter, cover with half of the whipped
cream. Place other cake layer on top and finish frosting cake with
remaining whipped cream. Submitted By RHOMMEL <RHOMMEL@IX.NETCOM.COM>
