Title: RISOTTO WITH SAUSAGE
Categories: Italian, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Links parsley/cheese sausage
-=OR=-
1/2 lb - Luganega sausage,
- (commercially made)
1 qt Meat broth
1/3 c  Finely chopped onion
3 tb Butter
2 tb Dry white wine
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
3/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
REMOVE THE CASINGS from the sausage and break up the sausage. Bring
the broth to a simmer. In a casserole, soften the chopped onion in
half the butter. Add the sausage meat and brown it. Raise heat,
sprinkle on the wine, and let it evaporate. Add the rice, stirring to
coat all the grains with the fat. Saute 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium-low and start adding broth, a ladleful at a time. Stir
often and add more broth only as the rice begins to dry out. Cook for
35 to 45 minutes, or until the rice is al dente and has absorbed
almost all its liquid. (If you run out of broth before then, use
boiling water.) Stir in the remaining butter and all the grated
cheese. Taste for salt and pepper. Serve at once.
