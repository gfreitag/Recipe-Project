KP>  The Mexicans make a wonderful pork stew called Pozole that
contains KP>  hominy, pork, chunks of chiles, onions, etc, topped
with fresh chopped KP> veggies, lime juice. From DeWitt and Gerlach,
Whole Chile Pepper Book:

Posole is one of the ... most basic methods of preparing corn.
... The name seems to be a variation of -pozo-, Spanish for
"puddle," and in Mexico the dish is spelled -pozole-.

Cook first 6 ingredients over medium heat for 3 hr or until posole is
tender. Add water as necessary. Add pork and cook 1/2 hr or until
tender. Serve in soup bowls, accompanied by soft tortillas.

Soak the 8 chiles in hot water for 15 min. Put chiles and 1 c of the
water and the garlic powder in a blender and blend until smooth.
Serve in a bowl on the side. Serve the onion and cilantro in bowls on
the side.
