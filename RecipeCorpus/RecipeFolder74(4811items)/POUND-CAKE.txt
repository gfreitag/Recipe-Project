PS:  This makes a big cake which will keep much longer than I've ever
seen one last.  It's also almost impossible to overbake. A couple
years ago I was making one as an Xmas gift for friends. I went to
bed, forgetting to remove the cake from the oven, and it baked all
night long. When I finally got it out of the oven (over 7 hours after
it went in) the cake was perfectly OK except for a suface layer about
«" deep that was a bit dry. I made another cake for the gift, but my
family gobbled the "mistake" in short order.
