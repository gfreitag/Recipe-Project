Remove fat and silver skin from loin. Whisk marinade ingredients
together and marinate loin a maximum of 6 hours refrigerated. Turn
occasionally.

Prepare sauce and keep warm. Quickly sear loin in a large pan until
nicely browned all over (4 - 5 minutes). Place on a rack in a
roasting pan and roast rare to medium rare (120 - 125 degrees
internal temperature). Allow loin to rest for 5 minutes before
slicing.

At serving time: Spoon sauce onto warm plates. Slice venison into
medallions and arrange on top of sauce. Garnish with parsnip chips
and herb sprigs.
