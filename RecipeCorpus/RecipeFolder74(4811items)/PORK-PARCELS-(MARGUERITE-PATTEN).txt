Title: PORK PARCELS (MARGUERITE PATTEN)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
2    British pork loin chops
3 oz Courgettes, unpeeled
1 sm Cooking apple, peeled
2 md Tomatoes, skinned
2 ts Tomato puree
1 ts Chopped fresh sage  or
1/2 ts Dried sage
Salt and black pepper
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F, Gas Mark 4. Cut 2 squares of foil,
suffciently large to envelop the meat and other ingredients. Cut away
any surplus fat from the pork, but leave a little to give flavour to
the food. Thinly slice the courgettes, chop the apple and chop the
tomatoes. Mix the courgettes, apple, tomatoes, tomato puree and sage
together, season to taste. Put half the tomato mixture and a chop on
each piece of foil, wrap this loosely, but securely, round the food
to make 2 parcels. Stand in a roasting tin, in case any juice seeps
out and cook for 55 minutes. Serve with jacket or boiled potatoes and
a green vegetable.
