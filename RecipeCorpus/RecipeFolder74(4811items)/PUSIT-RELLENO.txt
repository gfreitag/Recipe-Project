Title: PUSIT RELLENO
Categories: Mexican, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM----------------------STUFFED CALAMARI---------------------------
12 lg Squids
1/2 lb Ground pork
3    Green onions, finely sliced
1    Egg, beaten
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 md Onion, chopped
1 md Tomato, chopped
1/2    Bay leaf
1 tb Soy sauce
Remove squid heads and ink sacs, clean the calamari outside and
inside. Sprinkle salt lightly on squids and set aside. In a large
bowl combine ground pork, green onions, beaten egg and a little salt
and pepper. Stuff squid cavities with meat mixture. This is messy and
slippery, don't over stuff the calamari as the stuffing will swell
when cooking. A pastry bag makes this easier to do. Place a pan in a
steamer and steam the calamari covered for 10-15 minutes, or until
filling is cooked. Drain liquid and set aside. Prepare sauce while
steaming calamari. In a skillet over medium heat, saute garlic in oil
until lightly browned. Add onion and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato,
bay leaf and soy sauce and cook for 3-5 minutes until tomato pieces
are soft. Pour sauce on top of stuffed calamari. Serve with rice.
Note: I save the tentacles from the calamari and as a side dish stir
fry them with some shrimp and vegetables. I used the broth from
steaming the calamari as a liquid in this dish. This is NOT a good
dish to serve to people who don't like calamari or are a bit
squeamish. Regular bananas can be used but they should be very firm
and green.
