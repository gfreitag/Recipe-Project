7 minutes until they begin to have a good, toasty smell. Cut cabbage
into quarters or sixths, so that pieces are no more than about 2
1/2-inches across. Remove cores and slice pieces very thinly. Set
aside. Cut apple into sixths, remove cores, then thinly slice pieces
crosswise. Combine vinegar and olive oil in wide saute pan over
medium-high flame. When hot, add onion and saute 30 seconds. Add
cabbage and stir with tongs about 2 minutes or until just wilted.
Leaves will begin to soften and color will change from bright
purple-red to pink. Season to taste with salt, plenty of pepper and
more vinegar, if necessary, to sharpen flavors. Add most of cheese
and parsley, all the apples and walnuts. Toss briefly to combine,
garnish with remaining cheese and parsley and serve.
