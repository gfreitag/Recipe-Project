Title: RED CABBAGE WITH APPLES
Categories: Entrees
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Red cabbage
6 tb Bacon fat or butter
-(or less)
1    Onion, finely chopped
1 c  Red wine, dry
2    Apples, tart, cored
-and diced (not peeled)
2 tb Brown sugar
1 tb Wine vinegar
1/2 ts Caraway seeds
Discard the outer leaves of a firm,  3-lb red cabbage, and cut it in
half. Shred finely and soak in salted water for 15 minutes. Drain
well.

Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large, heavy skillet and add 1
finely chopped onion.  Cook onion until transparent, about 5 minutes,
then add cabbage.  Toss well with two wooden spoons, as you would a
salad. When cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly ground black
pepper to taste, and red wine.

Simmer for 5 minutes and then add 2 tart apples, cored and diced, but
not peeled.  Sprinkle with brown sugar, and add wine vinegar and
caraway seeds. Cover, with lid slightly askew, and simmer over low
heat for about 45 minutes. Serves 8 and is good hot or cold.

NOTES:

*  A fruity cabbage saute -- I just tried this recipe from a column
in the local paper.  It's good winter food, very satisfying on a cold
nasty day. My only caveat is to use a *large* skillet, or halve the
recipe. I cooked a full batch and had cabbage overflowing onto the
stove.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

: Enjoy!
