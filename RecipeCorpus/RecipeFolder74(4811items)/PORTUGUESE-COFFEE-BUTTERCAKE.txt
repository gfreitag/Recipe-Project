Cake Wafers

Cake wafers:  Preheat oven to 350 deg. F.  Invert two (or more if you
have them) 9-inch round cake pans; grease and flour bottoms of pans.

Beat butter in mixer bowl until smooth.  Beat in sugar until light and
fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Beat in vanilla. Beat in flour and salt just until combined.

Spread 1/3 cup batter evenly on each inverted cake pan to within 1/4
inch of edge.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly browned around
edges. With long, thin metal spatula, loosen each wafer and transfer
to wire racks to cool completely.  Repeat on buttered, floured pans
with remaining batter to make a total of 12 wafers. (Can be made
ahead. Stack between sheets of wax paper and cover tightly, up to 2
days.)

Coffee buttercream:  Heat milk in medium saucepan over medium heat
just to boiling.  Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks and sugar together in
medium bowl. Gradually whisk in hot milk. Return mixture to saucepan;
cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until mixture
thickens and coats back of spoon, about 6 minutes. (Do not boil.)
Strain through sieve into mixer bowl.  Stir in coffee powder and
vanilla. Cool to room temperature. Beat in 2 cups butter, 1
tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition.

To assemble, place 1 cake wafer on serving platter. Spread evenly
with 1/3 cup buttercream.  Add second wafer and 1/3 cup more
buttercream; repeat with remaining wafers and buttercream, ending
with wafer. Pipe remaining buttercream decoratively on top.  (Can be
made ahead. Cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.) Remove from
refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. Makes 16 servings.
