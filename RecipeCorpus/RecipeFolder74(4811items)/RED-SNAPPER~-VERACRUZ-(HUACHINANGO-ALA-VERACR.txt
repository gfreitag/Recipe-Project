METHOD: Rinse the fish well in cold water to remove any remaining
scales. Pierce the flesh on both sides with a sharp fork and rub in
the lime juice and about 2 tsp of the salt. set the fish aside to
season in an ovenproof dish into which it will just fit. ( If dish is
too large the sauce will dry up.) Preheat oven to 350. Heat the oil
in a heavy frying pan. Add the onions and fry gently, stirring from
time to time, until they are wilted but not browned. Add the chopped
tomatoes. Press the seeds and pulp through a strainer to extract all
the juice and add it with the olives, capers, half of the parsley and
salt to taste. Cook over a fairly high flame until the sauce is
well-seasoned and reduced-- about ten minutes. Pour the sauce over
the fish. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove
foil, turn the fish over and continue baking, uncovered, basting with
the sauce from time to time for a further 25 minutes or until fish is
done. When tested with a fork the flesh should flake easily away from
the bone. Sprinkle with the rest of the parsley and decorate with the
strips of red pepper. Serve the fish with plenty of the sauce and hot
tortillas and/or white rice.
