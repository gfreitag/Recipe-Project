3 c  Flour

until well blended. Add lemon peel and juice; mix to blend. Beat in
eggs, 1 at a time, until smooth. Gradually stir in 3 cups of the
flour, mixing well. cover and chill until dough is firm enough to
handle easily, at least 3 hours or as long as 2 days. For easier
handling, chill the dough before you form the ring-shaped cookies.
Divide dough in half. Cover and chill 1 portion.  Divide other half
into 8 equal pieces. With floured fingers, roll each piece on a
lightly floured board to make a 10-inch rope. Overlap ends of each
rope slightly to form a ring. Place rings about 1 inch apart on a
greased 14x17 inch baking sheet. Sprinkle light with sugar. Bake in a
300 F. oven until golden, 35-40 minutes. Remove cookies from pans and
let cool completely on racks. Repeat with remaining dough. Serve or
store airtight up to 10 days.
