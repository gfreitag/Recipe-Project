Title: POUND CAKE~ LITTLE HOUSE STYLE
Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 1 Cake
1 lb Butter, unsalted
1 lb Sugar, granulated
8 md Eggs
1 pn Salt
1/2 ts Nutmeg, ground
1/2 ts Mace, ground
4 c  Flour, sifted
At least an hour before starting, set out all refrigerated
ingredients to warn to room temperature.

In a large bowl, cream butter until fluffy. Gradually work in the
sugar and blend until mixture is no longer grainy.

Add salt to eggs; beat eggs until light-colored and foamy, about five
minutes. Add nutmeg and mace to eggs.

Stir eggs gradually into sugar-butter mixture. Sift flour and beat in
gradually, stirring only long enough to blend all ingredients. The
finished batter will be quite stiff.

Smooth the batter into an ungreased tube pan. Bake in a preheated 350
oven for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 325 and continue to bake
another 30 minutes. When a new broomstraw or toothpick poked in the
center comes out dry and the cake edges pull away from the pan,
remove pan from oven and cool. Turn cake out and serve unfrosted.
