Title: PURIS
Categories: Breads, Spicy
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 c  Whole Wheat Flour
2/3 c  Water
1 tb Melted Butter Or Ghee
2 ts Vegetable Oil
Ghee Or Oil For Deep Frying
Yield:  16 Puris Cooking Time: 40 Minutes

Place the flours in a bowl, add enough of the water to make a soft
pliable dough.  Add the melted butter, knead until smooth. Cover the
bowl with a damp cloth, leave in a warm place for one hour. Divide
into 16 pieces and, using a little oil on the hands, shape into
balls. Grease the rolling pin and board with oil, roll each ball into
a thin pancake. Heat the ghee until smoking hot, place a puri in the
frying pan. Turn immediately and press with a fish slice (slotted
spatula or pancake turner) until the puri puffs up. Cook until
golden.  Drain on absorbent paper, serve as soon as possible.
