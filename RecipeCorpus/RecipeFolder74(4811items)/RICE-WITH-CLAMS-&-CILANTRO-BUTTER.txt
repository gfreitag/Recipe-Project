Rinse clams thoroughly.  Put them in a large saucepan and add the
wine. Cover and cook over fairly high heat just until they open.
Reserve 1/2 cup of the clam juice.

In medium skillet heat oil and butter until foaming. Add onion and
saute over low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft but not
browned. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly
browned. Pour in reserved clam juice and water and add salt and
pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat 20 minutes.

Prepare cilantro butter by mixing thoroughly softened butter with
cilantro and lemon juice.  Shell and dice clams. Using a two-pronged
fork, carefully stir clams into rice. Cover and let stand 10 minutes.
Stir in cilantro butter and taste for seasoning.  Serve immediately.
