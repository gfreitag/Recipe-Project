Title: QUICK ONION POT ROAST
Categories: Crockpot
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Onion soup mix.
3 lb Lean beef pot roast -- trim
All fat
3 tb Flour in
3 tb Water -- mixed to a paste.
This roast needs no prior browning.  Meat brown in the slow cooker and
forms a brown gravy. Prepare vegetables separately. Sprinkle onion
soup over the bottom of the crock pot. Add pot roast. Cover and cook
on LOW about 10 hrs. or 5 hrs. on HIGH. Pour accumulated juices into
a saucepan; skim off fat. Add flour-water paste and bring to the
boil, stirring constantly until thickened. Serve over sliced meat.
