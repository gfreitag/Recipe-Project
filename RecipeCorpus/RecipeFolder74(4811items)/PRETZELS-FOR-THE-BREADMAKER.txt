MMMMM--------------------------PRETZELS-------------------------------
2 1/2 ts Yeast
4 c  Flour
2/3 ts Salt
1 1/3 tb Sugar
2 1/2 tb Margarine; or butter
1 1/3 c  -Water
MMMMM----------------------WATER FOR 'BATH---------------------------
4 c  -water; at a simmer
5 ts Baking soda
Add into the bread machine in this order.  Set on manual.

FORMING: Cut dough into short strips, roll into ropes and shape into
pretzels. Cover with a tea towel and let rise for 45 minutes. 'BATH':
In a cast iron or OTHER NON-ALUMINUM pan, bring almost to a boil 4
cups of water and 5 teaspoons of baking soda. Gently place (by hand
or using slotted spoon) the pretzels into the water for approximately
15 seconds on each side turning once. Do NOT let water come to a
boil. Remove pretzels and place on a greased baking sheet. Sprinkle
with coarse salt (kosher). Bake at 475 for 12 minutes.

NOTE: In my oven it took only about 10 minutes, so watch carefully.
Do NOT make the strips too fat; they really puff up. If you are on a
salt-free diet, use sesame, poppy, garlic; whatever you like on the
outside...the WHOLE family, both upstairs and downstairs loved them
and the DAK did all the hard work.
* If you use a machine that needs the water first add ingredients in
reverse order. FROM: Donna German's THE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK I and
