A fatty cut of beef gives this dish more beef flavor, which is the
point of the dish; rich, mellow, gently seasoned.

Red-Cooking Meat:   In medium hot wok, toast peppercorns until fra-
grant (avoid burning); crush & finely mince with cleaver; reserve.
Cut beef into 1 1/2" chunks. Heat cooking oil in hot wok until it
starts to smoke; brown beef in several batches; drain oil & discard.
Combine peppercorns & remaining ingredients of red-cooking liquid;
add to wok. Bring to boil; reduce heat & simmer, covered, for 1 1/2
to 2 hours, until meat is very tender.  (If liquid evaporates before
meat is tender, add cup of water or stock and continue cooking.)
Remove meat from liquid. If desired, cool meat, cover and refrigerate.

Boiling Noodles:  Bring 4 qts. water to rolling boil; add noodles.
Drain when still slightly undercooked.

Stir-frying:  Heat peanut oil in hot wok.  When oil starts to smoke,
add scallions & stir-fry until fragrant. Add garlic, ginger & Napa
cabbage; stir-fry for about 1 minute, until cabbage is slightly wilt-
ed. Add meat & all gravy ingredients except cornstarch paste. Reduce
heat to medium, cover, & simmer for about 3 minutes. Remove cover;
dribble in enough cornstarch paste to make a light gravy; not too
heavy as you want to coat noodles, but not too soupy either. Turn up
heat; when sauce returns to boil, add noodles. Toss to mix (& reheat)
noodles. Transfer to warmed serving platter or large bowl.
