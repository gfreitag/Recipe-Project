HEAT THE OIL in a large Dutch oven or roasting pan and add the
turkey, skin side down. Cook over high heat until skin is golden,
about 7 minutes. Remove the turkey and pour off the oil. Replace the
pot on the stove and add the water, onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme,
barley, salt and pepper. Replace the turkey, skin side up. Cover,
reduce heat to low and simmer 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat the butter over
low heat in a covered skillet, add the leeks, cover and cook 20
minutes, stirring occasionally. When the leeks are tender, remove
from the heat and set aside. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board
and remove the onion and bay leaves from the barley. Add the cream
and cook another 3 minutes or until barley mixture thickens. When
it's time to serve dinner, carefully remove the meat from the bones
and discard bones. Cut the breast meat against the grain into thin
diagonal slices. Pour the barley onto a large platter. Arrange the
turkey on the barley and pile the leeks in the center of the platter.
Serve immediately.
