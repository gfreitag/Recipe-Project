Cook an assortment of rice: white, brown and wild. Chill. Cook small

chunk, and fennel stalk. Rinse, drain, chill.

About two to three hours before service, combine the chilled rice and
beans in a large mixing bowl.  Peel a carrot and cut it into 1-inch
pieces. Finely chop, along with 5 to 6 broccoli florets and
cauliflower florets (as fine as or finer than KFC's slaw), in a food
processor. Add to the bowl and toss. Dry-pan roast the pecans pieces
for about 4 minutes over medium heat. Remove from heat.  Let cool.
Add to salad.

Mince by hand the onion, the red bell pepper and the fresh cilantro
leaves. Chop the canned chili peppers (if necessary). Add to salad
and toss well. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Toss well. Add
3 tablespoons salad-dressing.  Toss. Chill.  Serve on bed of thinly
shredded lettuce. Makes 4 single-cup servings.

Salad dressings Ground sundried tomato with oregan in a basic
vinegar-oil-water blend. Dessert: Thin a raspberry vinaigrette with
fresh orange (valencia) juice.

Other ideas: Fat-free Italian or wine-vinaigrette. Fat-Free
Asign-Ginger is good.
