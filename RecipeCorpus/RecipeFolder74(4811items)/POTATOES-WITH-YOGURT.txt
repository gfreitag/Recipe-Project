Title: POTATOES WITH YOGURT
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
700 g  Potatoes
1 tb Butter
200 g  Yogurt
2 tb Lemon juice
1    Scallion (green part only)
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
1/2    Red pepper; finely chopped
Salt and pepper
Butter
Greaseproof paper
Boil the potatoes 30 minutes with their skins (they should not be too
soft). Remove peel from potatoes while they are still hot, cut
potatoes into small cubes, then saute them in the butter and add salt
and pepper to taste. In a bowl, stir together the yogurt, lemon
juice, parsley and only the green stalk of the scallion (finely
chopped). Add the red pepper, then mix in the potatoes. Butter a
large piece of greaseproof paper and place the potatoes in the middle
of it. Seal the paper around the potatoes, and put it on a baking pan
in a preheated 190 C oven and bake for about 15 minutes. Unwrap the
"package" onto a platter and serve immediately.
