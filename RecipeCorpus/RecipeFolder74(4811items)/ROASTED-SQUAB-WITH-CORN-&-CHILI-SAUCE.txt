Categories: New, Text, Import
4    squabs, 12-16 ounces each,
dressed
Salt and freshly ground
pepper to taste
Yield: 4 Servings
:
:
:
2 TB crushed juniper berries
1/4 c  pure olive oil
Corn and Chili Sauce:
:
4 oz slab bacon cut into 1/2-inch
cubes
:
1    onion, peeled and diced --
(about 1/2 cup)
:
3    ears fresh corn
3 TB Chili Paste, -- recipe
follows
:
2 TB maple syrup
2 TB red wine vinegar
1 c  dry red wine
1 TB ground cumin
1 lg ripe tomato, -- seeded and
diced
:
1 c  Chicken Stock

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F for 20 minutes. Season the squabs
inside and out with the salt and pepper. Place the juniper berries
into the cavities and brush the squabs with olive oil. Place
breast-side down in a roasting pan and roast in the hot oven 20
minutes for rare.

Meanwhile, in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, over low heat, cook the cubed
bacon until fully browned. Remove the bacon bits, leaving the bacon
fat in the saucepan. Add the diced onion to the bacon fat and slowly
saute until translucent.

While the onion is cooking, cut the corn from the cob, and set the
kernels aside. Cut or break the cobs to a size that will fit the
saucepan, and add them to the cooking onions. The cobs will
contribute a wonderful flavor to the finished sauce.

Add the chili paste to the onion/corn cob mixture and cook 2 to 3
minutes. Add the maple syrup, vinegar, and red wine, and reduce by
half. Add the remaining ingredients, except the reserved corn
kernels. Cook another 15 minutes, then remove the corn cobs and add
the kernels. Cook 2 minutes longer, then remove from the heat and
pour over the roasted squabs to serve.
