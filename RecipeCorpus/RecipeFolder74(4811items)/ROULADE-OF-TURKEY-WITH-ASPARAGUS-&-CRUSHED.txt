Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Ound
24    Asparagus spears
14    Up
1    Ablespoon
1    Mall
3    Hole
2    Ablespoons
Turkey breast slices
Chives -- chopped
Olive oil
Shallot -- chopped
Red ripe tomatoes
Chicken broth
Lightly steam asparagus. Peel, seed and chop tomatoes. Lightly
flatten each cutlet. Place 6 asparagus spears at center of each,
sprinkle with a tbs of chives and roll up, reserving remaining chives
for garnish. Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside. Heat olive oil in a
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring
often, until golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and stock and
heat through, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, stirring
occasionally. Meanwhile, bring 3 cups water to a boil underneath a
bamboo or vegetable steamer over high heat. Taking care to keep them
from getting wet, steam roulades until turkey is no longer pink,
15-17 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking time. Remove
plastic wrap and slice roulades on the diagonal into 4 or 5 coins.
Spoon sauce onto plates, arrange roulade slices in it and garnish
with chives as desired.
