Title: ROCK CANDY
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Batch
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  ;Water
Punch holes at the top edge of a thin 8" square pan and lace about 7
strings from one side to the other. Place the laced pan in a pan deep
enough to catch any leaking syrup. Dissolve sugar in water and cook
without stirring to about hard ball stage (247-252 degrees). Pour
syrup into laced pan. It should reach a level about 3/4" above the
strings. Cover the surface with a piece of foil. Watch and wait. The
syrup sometimes takes a week to crystallize. Lift out the laced pan.
Cut the strings and dislodge the rock candy. Rinse quickly in cold
water and put on racks in a very low oven to dry.
