Here's an Amish recipe that might come in handy if you got a bunch of
punkin' stuff laying around.  The date on this is 10/12/88. That's
right++'88!  I've had this pile of papers for a *long* time...

In small saucepan, heat milk and 2 Tbs. butter just until warm (120F
to 130F) and butter is almost melted, stirring constantly.

In large mixer bowl, combine pumpkin, sugar and salt. Add milk
mixture and beat with electric mixer until well mixed. Beat in egg
and yeast.

In separate mixing bowl, combine flours.  Add half of flour mixture to
pumpkin mixture.  Beat mixture on low speed for 5 minutes, scraping
sides of bowl frequently. Add remaining flour and mix thoroughly
(dough will be very soft).  Turn into lightly greased bowl then
grease surface of dough lightly.  Cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down.  Turn onto floured surface.  Knead a few turns to
form a smooth dough, sprinkling with enough additional flour to make
dough easy to handle. On lightly floured surface, roll dough into 12-
by 10-inch rectangle.

In small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon. Brush surface of
dough with melted butter.  Sprinkle with brown sugar mixture.
Beginning with long side of dough, roll up jelly-roll style. Pinch
seam to seal.

With sharp knife, cut roll into twelve 1-inch slices. Place rolls,
cut side up, in greased 9-inch square baking pan. Cover and let rise
until nearly doubled, 30 to 45 minutes,

Bake rolls at 350F for about 20 minutes or until golden.

Remove from pan to waxed paper-lined wire rack.  Cool for 10 to 15
minutes.

Makes 12 rolls.
