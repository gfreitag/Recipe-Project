cubes. Drain & rinse canned bean curd; cut into 1/2" cubes. (If using
fresh bean curd, wrap it in clean dish towel and press it for 1 hour
to make it more firm.  Wrap it tightly & use about a 5-pound weight.)
Drain radish & cut into 1/2" cubes. Cut green onions, including tops,
into 2" lengths. Sauce: In a cup, cream together peanut butter and
soy sauce. Slowly mix in remaining sauce ingredients. Set aside.
Stir-frying: Add oil to hot wok. When oil starts to smoke, add pork.
Stir-fry for about 1 minute. Add garlic & ginger; stir-fry for
another 30 seconds. Transfer pork to saucepan; add peanut sauce; heat
& simmer for 15 minutes, adding onions about mid-way. Skim off excess
oil.  Add more stock if sauce thickens. Steaming: In Chinese steamer,
steam radish & bean curd on its serving plate for 15 minutes, just
prior to serving.  When ready to serve, drain water off plate, and
top vegetables with pork & peanut sauce.
