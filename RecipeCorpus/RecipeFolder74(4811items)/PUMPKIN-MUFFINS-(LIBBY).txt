Title: PUMPKIN MUFFINS (LIBBY)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Complete baking mix (I use
Arrowhead mills multigrain
Which
Is lacto but not ovo and is
Lf)
1 c  Pumpkin (1/2 can)
1/4 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Water
1/4 ts Each (or to taste) ground
Allspice, nutmeg, cloves,
And
Cinnamon
1/2 c  Raisins
stir all ingredients except raisins together until just mixed. fold in
raisins.  spoon into nonstick muffin tin (or use cupcake papers).
bake at 400 f 25 minutes for regular muffin tins, 35 minutes for
large muffin tins.

canned pumpkin seems to work about as well as applesauce for a baking
substitute for oil.  these muffins are quite chewy, but they are very
moist and tasty. I enhanced the pumpkin flavor with traditional
pumpkin pie spices, but the flavor could be downplayed for other
kinds of cakes or muffins, and would blend well with flavors like
banana or orange, and would be overshadowed by cocoa, for example.
