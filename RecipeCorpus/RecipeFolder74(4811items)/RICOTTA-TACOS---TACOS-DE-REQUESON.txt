Yield: 6 Servings
Jim Vorheis
1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
Sea salt to taste
1/3 c  Finely chopped radishes
1/4 c  Finely chopped white onion
1    Chile peron, black seeds
-removed and roughly
-chopped,
Or any hot green chile,
-chopped with seeds
1 tb Roughly chopped cilantro
The tacos:
1 c  Drained and lightly salted
-ricotta cheese
6    Thin 5-inch corn tortillas
6    Toothpicks
Safflower oil for frying
Have ready a tray lined with a double thickness of paper toweling.

First make the sauce.  Put the lime juice and salt into a glass bowl,
mix in the rest of the ingredients, and leave for at least 30 minutes
to marinate.  This should make about 1 cup.

Spread 1 tablespoon of the ricotta over half of each tortilla. Fold
over and secure with a toothpick.

Put oil to a depth of 1/4 inch in a large frying pan and heat. When
hot but not smoking, add a few of the tacos and fry, turning once
until they are a golden color and quite crisp. Continue with the
rest, adding oil if necessary.

Drain the tacos well on paper toweling and remove as soon as they are
cool enough to handle.  With a toothpick, ease them open and insert
about 2 tablespoons of the sauce.  Serve immediately; they cannot
wait.
