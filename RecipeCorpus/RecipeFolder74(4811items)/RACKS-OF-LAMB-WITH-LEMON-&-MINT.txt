Title: RACKS OF LAMB WITH LEMON & MINT
Categories: Meats, Valentine's
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Racks of lamb (ea.3/4 lb.)
LEMON MINT MARINADE:
2 tb Chopped fresh mint (or
1 tsp dried)
1 ts Grated lemon rind
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Vegetable oil
Pinch of pepper
Place each rack of lamb, meaty side up, on cutting board. Using sharp
paring knife, cut line across rack where meaty portion begins, about 3
inches down from rib ends. Cut off layer of fat between line and rib
ends.

Cut off meat and fat between bared ribs to expose bones. Scrape
exposed rib bones clean, removing any remaining meat and fat. Trim
fat from meaty portion of ribs to 1/8 inch thickness, lifting away
fat as you work.

With rib ends up, press racks together to interlink bones. Separate
bases about 1 inch to stabilize; place in shallow dish.

LEMON MINT MARINADE:  Whisk together mint, lemon rind and juice, oil
and pepper; brush over lamb.  Let stand at room temperature for 30
minutes.

Place lamb on greased rack in roasting pan; drizzle with any remaining
marinade.  Cover exposed ribs with foil to prevent charring. Roast in
450øF oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325øF; roast for 40 minutes
or until meat thermometer registers 140øF for rare and 150øF for
medium-rare.

Transfer to warm platter; tent with foil and let stand for 10
minutes. To serve, remove all foil; carve between bones. Makes 4
servings. Typed in MMFormat by cjhartlin@msn.com Source: Canadian
