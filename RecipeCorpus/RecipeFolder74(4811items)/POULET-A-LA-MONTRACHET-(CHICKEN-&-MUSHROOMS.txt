Size)
8 oz Button mushrooms
I oz butter
1    Long branch tarragon or
1    Sprig each thyme, rosemary
Parsley
1    Bay leaf
Salt -- black pepper
1/4 pt White burgundy
2 lg Egg yolks
1/2 pt Double cream
Serves 6  Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in
boiling water. Cut into 10 serving pieces: 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2
wings and 2 breasts halved. Scrape the carrots and peel the onions.
Wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth and trim the stalks. Melt the
butter in a heavy iron cocotte [heavy frying pan or Dutch oven. S.C.]
over low heat and when foaming add the pieces of chicken, the carrots
and onions, and the herbs tied together. Season with salt and pepper,
add the wine, cover and cook for 30 minutes, moving the ingredients
around occasionally to prevent colouring. When the carrots and onions
are tender remove them with a slotted spoon, cover and keep hot over
a pan of boiling water.

Slice the mushrooms finely, add to the pan, sprinkle with salt, cover
and simmer for a further 20 minutes. Beat the egg yolks into the
cream and set aside.

Remove the chicken from the pan to a heated serving dish, place the
vegetables around it in small groups, cover with foil and keep hot.

Using the back of a fork, work the meat residue from the bottom of
the pan into the cooking juices. Bring to boiling point, remove the
herbs, and draw the pan from the heat. Add a tablespoon of pan juices
to the cream, stir well and return this mixture to the pan, stirring
constantly until thick. Pour imme- diately over the chicken and serve
without delay.

The excellent sauce of this dish is best appreciated when accompanied
by plain noodles or boiled rice.
