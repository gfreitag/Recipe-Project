Title: PRIMO FUDGE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
3 oz Cream cheese
1 lb Powdered sugar

This rivals Fanny Farmer even.    Combine cheese, sugar, butter,
honey, vanilla, condensed milk; blend smoothly. Quickly add melted
chocolate and nuts. Place into buttered pan. Spread about 1" thick.
Chill; cut into squares.    As a variation I have chilled the fudge a
bit then, with buttered hands, scoop out some of it, make a log and
roll it in chopped pecans. PRIMO STUFF!
