Title: RISOTTO PARMIGIANO
Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
5 c  To 6 Cups Chicken Stock
1 tb Olive Oil
1 sm Onion -- minced
1 1/2 c  Arborio Rice
3 tb Unsalted Butter -- at room
Temperature
Salt And Pepper
2/3 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan.

Heat the olive oil in a 3-quart saucepan and cook the onion over
medium heat, stirring until the onion is golden but not brown - about
3-5 minutes.

Add the rice and stir to coat the rice.  Turn the heat to
medium-high, add about 1/2 cup of the stock and keep the mixture
boiling, stirring constantly.  As soon as the stock has been
absorbed, add another 1/2 cup of stock and stir.  The risotto must
keep boiling, but it must not stick to the pot.  The whole cooking
process may take 25-30 minutes. Once all the stock has been absorbed,
and the risotto is tender, remove the pan from the heat and quickly
stir in the butter and parmesan.
