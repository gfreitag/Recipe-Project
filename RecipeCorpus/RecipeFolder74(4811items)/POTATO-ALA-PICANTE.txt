These impressive and easy-to-prepare "pleated" potatoes are an ideal
accompaniment to all manner of meats, fish and poultry. Thanks to Ruth
Krening of Fort Morgan, Colorado for sharing her recipe.

Cut potatoes crosswise into 1/8" to 1/4" slices, being careful not to
cut all the way through so the potato remains intact. Place cut side
up in a shallow baking dish. Slip onion slices in between cuts in
potato, rounded side up. Brush or spoon butter evenly over potatoes;
sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake in preheated oven at 425'F. 1 hour
15 minutes or until fork tender. Remove from oven; spoon Pace Picante
Sauce evenly over each potato. Continue baking 10 minutes. Sprinkle
with cheese; return to oven just until cheese is melted. Serve with
additional Pace Picante Sauce.
