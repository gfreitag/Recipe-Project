Yield: 2 Servings
4 c  Salad greens & shredded
-carrots
2 c  Chopped, cooked chicken

Combine salad, chicken, vinaigrette and sesame seeds in a medium bowl.
Divide mixture between the tortillas.  Fold the left and right sides
of each tortilla over the chicken mixture, about 2 inches.  Roll
tightly away from you and secure with two toothpicks (one on each
side). Cut the rolls in half, and serve.

Notes: I used a salad in a bag (Dole's French Blend) and pre-cooked
chicken (Purdue Short-Cuts, Original flavor).
