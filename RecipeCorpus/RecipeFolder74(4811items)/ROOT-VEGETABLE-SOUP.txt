Title: ROOT VEGETABLE SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lg Leeks white part only
4 tb Unsalted butter
2 1/2 tb All purpose flour
6 c  Homemade chicken stock
3 md Carrots peeled and cubed
3 md Turnips peeled and cubed
2 md Parsnips peeled and cubed
2 md Red potatoes peeled and
Cubed
2    Hearts of bibb lettuce
Leaves separated and rinsed
2 c  Fresh spinach leaves
Stemmed and rinsed
Salt and white pepper to
Taste
1/2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Fine minced chives
And parsley for garnish
Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and then crosswise into thin slices.
Place in a colander and run under warm water to remove all traces of
sand. Drain and set aside. In a large casserole, melt the butter over
low heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for one minute
without browning. Add the chicken stock and whisk until well blended.
Add the reserved leeks, carrots, turnips, parsnips and potatoes.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are
almost tender. Add the lettuce and spinach leaves to the soup, and
season with salt and pepper. The lettuce should just wilt, but still
remain crisp. Do not overcook. Before serving, add the heavy cream
and heat the soup through without letting it come to a boil. Transfer
the soup to a large tureen, sprinkle with chives and parsley and
serve hot with thin slices of black bread.
