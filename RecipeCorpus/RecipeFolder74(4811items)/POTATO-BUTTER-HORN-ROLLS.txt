Title: POTATO BUTTER HORN ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Hot mashed potatoes
1 tb Salt
2 c  Milk
2 tb Sugar
4 tb Melted shortening
1    Cake compressed yeast
6 c  Flour
2    Eggs, well beaten
Add sugar, salt, and shortening to freshly prepared hot mashed
potatoes. Cool, and add eggs.  Soften yeast in milk and add the
potato mixture. Add flour, a little at a time, beating well after
each addition. Turn onto lightly floured board.  Knead until smooth
and elastic. (The dough should be as soft as it is possible to
handle.) Cover with a damp cloth, set in a warm place and allow to
double in bulk. Turn onto lightly floured board. Roll in round sheet
1/2 inch thick. Cut into sections as you would cut a pie, having each
section about 3 inches wide at the outer edge. Begin at the outside
and roll each section toward the center. Form into crescents. Place
on well-oiled baking sheet. Cover with a warm, damp cloth. Let rise
until treble in bulk. Bake in hot oven (450 F) about 12 minutes. 32
rolls. Mrs. Jessie Kelsey, Lakeland, FL.
