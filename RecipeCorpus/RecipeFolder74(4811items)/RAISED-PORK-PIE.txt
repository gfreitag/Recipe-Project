Title: RAISED PORK PIE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Pork (lean and fat mixed)
Salt and pepper
1 ts Mixed dried herbs
1/4 pt Jellied stock (made from
-pork bones)
MMMMM----------------------HOT WATER CRUST---------------------------
1 lb Plain flour
1 ts Salt
7 oz Lard
7 1/2 fl Milk and warm water (mixed
-in equal proportions)
Milk (for glaze) - optional
A jar (eg. a kilner jar)*
Dice pork for filling, season well and add herbs. For hot water
crust: warm a mixing bowl and sift in flour and salt, make a well in
the centre of the flour. Heat lard in milk and water. When just
boiling, pour into the well in the flour, stir quickly with a wooden
spoon until thick, then work with hand to a dough. Turn on to a board
or table, cut off a quarter of the dough, put it back in the bowl and
cover with a cloth.

Pat out the rest of dough with the fist to a thick round, set a large
jar in the centre and work dough up sides. Let dough cool then gently
lift out jar.  Fill dough case with meat mixture. Roll or pat out
remaining dough to form a lid, leave a small hole in it, then put on
top of pie, seal edges. Glaze with milk if wished.

Slide pie on to a baking sheet and bake in pre-set oven for 1-1 1/2
hours at 350 F.  If pie is getting too brown, cover with damp
greasproof paper towards end of cooking time. Leave till cool before
placing a funnel in hole in lid and filling up with jellied stock.

WATCHPOINT You must work quickly and mould pastry while it is still
warm, otherwise lard sets and pastry becomes brittle. (I make small
ones using small jars or straight sided glasses)

* Please don't ask me what a kilner jar is 'cause I don't know. I'll
ask on the net B-)
