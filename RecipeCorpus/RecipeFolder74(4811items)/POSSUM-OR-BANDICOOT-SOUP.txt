Title: POSSUM OR BANDICOOT SOUP
Categories: Soups, Oz
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Small possum or bandicoot*
2 l  Water
1 ts Salt
1 ea Tin corn*
Any other vegies desired
1 pn Celery leaves
1 pn Parsley
Flour or gravox* to thicken
Fried bread,1 slice per serv
Skin and clean possum or bandicoot, then quarter the animal. (Video
tape this please. I have no idea how to do it. Also "first you have
to catch a possum or bandicoot", but then that's another story.)
Place it in a large pot or camp oven along with water and salt. Cover
and simmer gently for 3 or 4 hours. (Tough little devils apparently.)
Add vegetables and simmer for another 1 1/2 hours (Still tough. Even
the vegies are resisting being associated with this.) Strain soup
through a large holed colander when meat has left bone and remove
bones, especially small ones. Return soup to the pot and add parsley
and celery leaves. Thicken with a little flour or gravox. Cut fried
bread into 1 inch squares and serve soup over toast,boiling hot.

*For those of you that haven't met a bandicoot, it is something
between a possum and a raccoon, sort of, I think, maybe.

*Tin of corn? Well a can I guess, 16 oz.

*Now, when you boil this meat for 5 1/2 hours, strain it and throw it
away, it does make me wonder why you started in the first place.

*Gravox is a meat concentrate seasoning I think. The dish must be
need some flavor.

*Fry the bread any way you want to.

*All things considered, a brick or stone would be a reasonable
alternative if you don't happen to have a possum or bandicoot
available.
