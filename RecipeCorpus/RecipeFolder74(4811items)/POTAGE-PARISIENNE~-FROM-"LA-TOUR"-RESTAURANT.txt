You have given me so many soup recipes, I thought you might like this
one. I use it as is or as a base for Clam Chowder, Corn Chowder, or
any soup that calls for a cream base. Saute onions in butter until
transparent, add flour and mix well.  Then add 3 cups chicken stock,
stir well and simmer slowly.  In a separate pot put the other 3 cups
chicken stock, potatoes, leek and bring to a boil.  Let simmer for 20
minutes. Then mix both pots, add the cream and check for seasoning
{salt}. Top with parsley. Makes 6 servings. Nancy/Crockett CA/12:26
