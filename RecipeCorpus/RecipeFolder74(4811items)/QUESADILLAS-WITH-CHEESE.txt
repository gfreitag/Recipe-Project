Title: QUESADILLAS WITH CHEESE
Categories: Mexican
Yield: 4 Servings
25 g  Butter
275 g  Grated cheddar cheese
1    Beaten egg
100 g  Sliced button mushrooms
12    Uncooked 15cm tortillas
Heat up the butter in a frying pan and saute the mushrooms until soft.
Spread a spoonful of cheese on half of each tortilla leaving a 1cm
margin around the edge. Top with the mushrooms. Brush the edges of
the tortilla with beaten egg, then fold in half and push the edges
firmly together to seal.

Pour vegetable oil into a deep frying pan to a depth of 1cm. Heat
until a cube of bread goes brown in 1 minute - then fry the
quesadillas, 2 or 3 at a time for 2 minutes on each side until
browned. Drain on kitchen paper and serve with tomatoes, cucumber and
coriander sprigs to garnish
