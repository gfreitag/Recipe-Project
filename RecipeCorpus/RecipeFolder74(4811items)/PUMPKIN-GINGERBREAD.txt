Title: PUMPKIN GINGERBREAD
Categories: Breads, Kooknet
Yield: 4 Loaves
2 c  All-purpose flour, divided
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 c  Canned pumpkin
1/2 c  Molasses
2    Eggs
1/3 c  Margarine
1/4 c  Milk
1 ts Ground ginger
Stir together 1 cup of the flour, the brown sugar, baking powder,
cinnamon, and baking soda.  Add the pumpkin, molasses, eggs,
margarine, milk and ginger. Mix vigorously until combined. Add the
remaining flour and blend in.  Divide the batter evenly among 4 small
loaf pans.

Bake in a 350 F oven for 40 to 50 minutes or until a wooden pick
inserted near the center of each loaf comes out clean. Cool the
loaves in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove the loaves
from the pans. Cool thoroughly on the wire racks.

To Freeze:  Wrap each loaf tightly in moisture- and vaporproof wrap.
Seal, label, and freeze for up to 6 months. To thaw, let stand,
loosely covered, at room temperature for 1 hour. Or, to micro-thaw,
place 1 unwrapped loaf on a microwave-safe paper towel. Microcook,
uncovered, at 30% power (medium-low) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.

Makes 4 loaves, 8 servings each.
