Title: REFRIGERATOR ROLLS-MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Bread/rolls, Soup/stews
Yield: 10 Rolls
1/4 c  Water
2 ts Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Milk, plus more for tops
3 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Honey
1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1. Combine water and yeast and let stand 5 minutes.

2. Scald milk and add butter, honey, and salt. Transfer to the large
bowl of an electric mixer. Cool until lukewarm. Beat in egg and add
yeast mixture.

3. Add half the flour and mix, using the paddle attachment, for 2
minutes. Add remaining flour and beat until large bubbles appear.

4. Transfer dough to an oiled bowl or plastic bag with ample room for
rising. If using a bowl, cover with a plate to keep dough from rising
too much. Refrigerate overnight.

5. Remove bowl from refrigerator and punch down dough. Turn out onto a
lightly floured board and divide into 10 equal portions. Butter an
8-inch round cake pan and arrange tolls in pan (they should be barely
touching). Let rise in a warm place, covered, for 1 1/2 hours, or
until doubled.

6. Heat oven to 350'. Brush rolls lightly with milk and bake for 25
minutes. Serve warm.
