Title: RATTLESNAKE CLUB BARBEQUE SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Ketchup
1/2 c  Prepared chili sauce
1/4 c  Prepared steak sauce
3 tb Dry mustard
2 tb Prepared horseradish
1 tb Molasses
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Jalapeno pepper -- minced
1 tb Garlic juice
1 tb Tabasco sauce
Whisk first 10 ingredients in bowl.  Add hot pepper sauce to taste.
(Can be prepared up to 1 week in advance. Cover and chill. Bring to
room temperature to serve.) I have also made a great briskit that I
got general directions for from my cousin in TX who competes in
briskit cook-offs. I ate his once and it was fantastic, melted in
your mouth. I have tried to duplicate it and have come close. Here it
is:

Mix together apple juice, Italian dressing, liquid smoke and inject
into briskit (or poke holes in it and marinate in stuff overnight)
When you smoke it, wrap it in aluminum foil for at least the first
half of smoking time.  This is the secret to being tender. Unwrap for
the last hour or two to brown.  Serve with barbecue sauce.
