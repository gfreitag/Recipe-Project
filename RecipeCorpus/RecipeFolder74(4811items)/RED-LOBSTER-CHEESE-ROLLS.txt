Title: RED LOBSTER CHEESE ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Copycat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Garlic salt or powder
1 tb Parsley flakes
1 ts Italian seasonings
5 lb Bisquick
44 oz Cold water
1 lb Cheddar cheese,
-sharp,grated
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot.

The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
biscuits.

You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if
desired.
