Title: RED BEANS WITH PECANS & SAFFRON OVER WHOLE
Categories: Pasta, Pulses and, Sauces and
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Can Red Beans
Pecan Halves
Dry Red Wine
Saffron
Oregano
Thyme
Black Pepper
Olive Oil
Garlic
Drain a small can of red beans.  (Pintos may substitute.) Save the
juice in a small bowl and add a small amount of crumbled saffron to
it so it marinates.  Not too much, you want the taste to be subtle,
not dominant.

Saute garlic in olive oil for a little bit, along with pecan halves
and some crushed red chiles. Add the drained beans and cook so the
flavors mingle.  Add quite a bit of oregano and less thyme and a
pinch of black pepper.  Add some dry red wine, don't be too shy. Add
in the saffron-flavored bean liquid and cook a few more minutes. The
consistency should be thin but not like soup.

Serve over whole wheat spaghetti.  Brown rice might also work.
