Title: POLISH BUTTER COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Holidays
Yield: 72 Servings
1 c  Unsalted Butter -- At Room
Temperature
1/2 c  (Scant)
2 lg Hard-Cooked Egg Yolks --
Pressed Thru' Sieve
1 lg Egg Yolk -- Lightly Beaten
1 ts Almond Extract
1 ts Vanilla Extract
2 c  All-Purpose Flour --
Unbleached
Sugar
1. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar in a
mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the cooked and raw egg
yolks and both extracts. Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate
the flour to make a smooth, somewhat stiff dough. Wrap dough in
plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours. 2. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
3. Roll out the dough 2/3 inch thick on a lightly floured surface.
(The cookies are supposed to be plump.) Cut into shapes with small 1
to 1 1/2-inch cookie cutters - hearts and stars work nicely. Gather
up the scraps, reroll, and cut out more cookies. Place 1/2 inch apart
on ungreased baking sheets. 4. Bake cookies until they just begin to
take on the slightest tinge of color, about 10 mins. Cool on wire
racks and store in an airtight container up to 1 week. Makes about 6
dozen small cookies.
