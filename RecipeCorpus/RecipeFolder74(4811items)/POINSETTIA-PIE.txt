let stand 1 minute.  Stir over low heat until gelatin is completely
dissolved. Beat egg yolks in small bowl. Stir about 1/4 cup gelatin
mixture into egg yolks, return egg yolk mixture to saucepan. Cook
over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the
back of the spoon. Remove from heat; stir in liqueur.  Cool to room
temperature.

Beat egg whites until foamy.  Gradually beat in remaining 1/4 cup
sugar; continue beating until soft paks form. Fold into gelatin
mixture. Gently fold in whipped cream. Pour into cooled crust.
