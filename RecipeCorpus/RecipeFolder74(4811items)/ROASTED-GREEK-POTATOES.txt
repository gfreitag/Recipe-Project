Title: ROASTED GREEK POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 3 Servings
1 lb Small red new potatoes --
Scrubbed
1/4 c  Lemon juice
2 ts Olive oil
1 sm Clove garlic -- peeled and
Minced
1 ts Dried oregano -- crushed
1/4 ts Salt
Freshly gound black pepper
To taste

Cut the potatoes into halves, or quarters if larger.

Combine the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and oregano in a small jar.
Shake to blend.

Line an 8x8 inch pan with aluminum foil.  Put the potatoes into the
pan and pour the lemon mixture over. Sprinkle with salt and pepper,
stirring to coat.  Pour in the water.

Roast in a preheated 400-degree oven 45 minutes to 1 hour. Turn the
potatoes occasionally.  The finished potatoes should be tender and
browned and will have absorbed the liquid.
