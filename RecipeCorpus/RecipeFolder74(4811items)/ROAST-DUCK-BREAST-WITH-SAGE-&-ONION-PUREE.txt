Title: ROAST DUCK BREAST WITH SAGE & ONION PUREE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb New potatoes
Salt and Pepper
3    Sprigs of Sage
2    Duck Breasts
2 md Onions
Olive oil
10 fl Milk
Boil the potatoes in their skins until tender in plenty of salted
water with two of the sprigs of sage. Preheat the oven to Gas Mark
6/400F/200C.

Heat a dry frying pan suitable for the oven (or a roasting tin) over
a high heat until very hot. Place the duck breasts, fat side down, in
the oven for two minutes until the fat starts to run. Season the top
fat-less sides with salt and pepper. Continue to cook for 2 minutes
and then transfer to the oven and roast for a further 10 minutes.
Turn the oven off, open the door and leave the duck breasts on the
edge to rest for 10 minutes.

Peel and chop the onions as finely as possible. Saute in three
tablespoons of olive oil for 10 minutes without browning. Meanwhile
remove the sprigs of sage, discard and mash the potatoes. Add the
potatoes to the onions along with the milk, beating all the time.
When you reach a suitably runny consistency, season with salt and
pepper and stir in a teaspoon of chopped sage leaves. Add more sage
to taste and serve with the duck, cut into slices. I serve this with
french beans but you could also use broccoli.
