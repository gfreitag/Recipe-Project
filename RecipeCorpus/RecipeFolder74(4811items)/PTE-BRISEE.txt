Title: PTE BRISEE
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 5 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
pn Sugar
5 1/2 tb Butter, -chilled
3 tb Shortning, -chilled
1/4 c  -ice water
Sift the flour, sugar and salt together into a bowl; add butter and
shortning and cut them into the dry ingredients with a pastry blender
or 2 knives until the mixture is like course meal.
Sprinkle on and blend in enough ice water to make a workable dough,
mixing water in lightly with a fork.
Turn dough out onto your work surface and, using the heel of your
hand, smear the dough away from you, about 1/4 cup at a time. Scrape
up the smeared dough into a ball, wrap and refrigerate for at least 2
hours.
Unwrap dough, place on floured work surface, and pound it a few
times with your rolling pin to soften it. Roll out 1/8-inch thick, or
to desired thickness.
Drape dough over quiche pan or tart pan, ease it into the pan
without stretching, pat into place, trim off excess, and crimp edge
if desired. Refrigerate for
30    minutes.
Preheat over to 400øF.
Remove chilled dough from refrigerator and prick the bottom and
sides well with a fork. Line the pan with foil or wax paper; fill
with beans, rice, or pastry weights to weight the crust. Bake for 10
minutes, until dough is just beginning to color.
Remove from oven, remove weights and lining, and cool slightly.
You now have a partially baked shell which can be filled and rebaked
for a quiche or a tart.
For fully baked shell, for fresh fruit tart, for example, remove
weights and lining from shell after 10 minutes and continue to bake
until it is golden brown and crisply flaky, about 25 minutes total.
Cool completely before filling.  [One 11-inch shell or 5-6 small tart
shells]
