Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2    Pork tenderloins, about 1
-pound each
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
2 ts Dried oregano
1 tb Olive oil
2    Bay leaves
1    Onion, halved, stuck with 4
-whole cloves
1 c  Water
Dry tenderloins well. Rub surfaces with minced garlic, salt, pepper
and oregano. Heat olive oil in a heavy Dutch oven; add meat and brown
very well, turning from time to time.

Add the bay leaves, onion and water. Cover and place in a 350 degree
F. oven for 1 1/2 hours. Check a couple of times to make sure there
is liquid remaining in the pot. Add another 1/2 cup water, if
necessary. Remove meat from pot and let cool 20 minutes, then slice.
Pull meat into shreds with your fingers. I usually place the shredded
pork and tinga sauce back into the Dutch oven with any remaining
broth in the pot.
