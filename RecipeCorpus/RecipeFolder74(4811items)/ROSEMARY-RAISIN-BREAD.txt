1 pk Active dry yeast
3 c  Unbleached bread flour
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Rosemary leaves

I adapted this from the Sunset Italian cookbook. It came out just
fine in the DAK. The original recipe calls for more olive oil (1/4 C)
if you are not watching fats, I bet it is wonderful that way.Cook on
white bread setting. I added raisins when around to it--I think it
was at the start of the second knead. Makes good sandwich bread or
toast. FROM: SHARON HALL (FNXB91A) Reformatted by Elaine Radis
