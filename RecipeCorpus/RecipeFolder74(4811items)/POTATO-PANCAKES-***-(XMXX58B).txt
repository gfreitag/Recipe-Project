Mary. If you printed out my mother-in-law's directions for preparing
the basic grated potato you are half way there to Bulviniai Cepelinai
Kukuliai, or as we say Klatskas. This recipe comes from the
Nationality Rooms Cookbook, U of Pittsburgh. The potato mixture :
Grate potatoes into cheese cloth (the cotton flour bag works better)
and squeeze until almost dry, reserve liquid. starch will settle out.
Add egg, flour and some of the starch to potatoes and mix well. Form
into 8 round balls and set aside. Mix meat with onion and egg and
form into 8 balls. Flatten the potato balls and place meat in center
and form the dough around the meat into the shape of zeppelins. Boil
in a large kettle of 4-6qts salted water for 30 minutes. Caution: For
40 years, mine fell apart, because I couldn't use flour My husband
said his mother never used it. So don't be surprised if they don't
hold together! I also prefer to cook my meat mixture first! Sauce:
Chop bacon and fry, drain and saute onions. Add sour cream, heat and
serve over the zeppelins. I have not used the starch, I have heard of
farina or cream of wheat substituted for flour. A tremendous relief
to be able to serve these after years of failure. Hope your husband
will be surprised. He should like the Kuglis too, on the original
bulletin. That is much easier.
