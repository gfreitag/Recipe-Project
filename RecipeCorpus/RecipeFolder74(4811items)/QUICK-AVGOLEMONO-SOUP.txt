Title: QUICK AVGOLEMONO SOUP
Categories: Soups, Greek
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  White rice, cooked
3 c  Chicken broth
1    Lemon, juiced
2 lg Eggs
If you don't have any leftover white rice, put about 1
1/2    cup of rice on to cook.

Heat the chicken broth to boiling.  While the chicken broth is
heating, beat together the lemon juice and eggs in a small bowl or
glass measuring cup until uniform in color.

When the chicken broth is boiling, stir in the cooked rice. Remove
from heat and stir briskly while slowly pouring the egg mixture into
the pot from about a foot in the air. The soup should end up
resembling a cream soup and there should be no large, visible threads
of egg.

NOTES:

*  Greek egg-lemon soup -- This is a perfect way to use up a little
leftover rice.

*  This recipe even works well with canned chicken broth since the
lemon covers up the "canned" flavor.

: Difficulty:  Easy
: Time:  20 minutes if you have to cook the rice, 10 minutes if you
don't. : Precision:  No need to measure.
