To use these sauces: bring them to a slow boil in a large kettle. Add
meat or poultry, return to slow boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook
until done. Drain meat and serve with some sauce (optionally
thickened with cornstarch-water) on the side. Save and reuse leftover
sauce, which gets richer with each use. Leftover sauce should be
salted lightly, boiled a few minutes, skimmed, and cooled before
storage in the refrigerator. If it is to be kept a long time it
should be boiled and skimmed once in awhile.
