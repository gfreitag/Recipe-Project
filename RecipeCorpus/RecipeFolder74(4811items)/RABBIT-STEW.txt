Dust pieces in flour and shake off excess. Brown in olive oil on all
sides in a large black iron pot (My prejudice). Remove and keep warm.
Add onions and garlic to same oil; cook until clear, not brown. Drain
off excess oil and replace rabbit. Pour on sherry. Add broth and
strained marinade. Bring to boil then reduce heat to simmer, covered,
for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
