with the cumin and rub the garlic paste into the chicken. Place the
chicken in a nonreactive bowl; pour the orange juice over it, cover,
and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Remove the chicken from
the marinade (reserving the marinade) and pat dry. In a
heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil over medium heat until fragrant,
then brown the chicken on all sides. Add the reserved marinade, the
sherry, onion, and stock, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer
until the chicken is fork tender, 35 to 45 minutess. Transfer the
chicken to a serving platter. Strain the sauce through a colander and
return it with the flour to the pan. Cook the sauce over low heat,
stirring, until it has thickened, 5 to 6 minutes, correct the
seasonings, pour over the chicken, and garnish with the parsley.
