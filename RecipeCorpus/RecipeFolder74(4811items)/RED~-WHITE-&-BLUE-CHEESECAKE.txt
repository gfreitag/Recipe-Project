28    Chocolate wafers, ground
Fine, about 1 1/2 cups crumb
1/2 c  Unsalted butter, melted
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
4    8-oz packages cream cheese
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
5 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Sour cream
1 ts Freshly grated orange zest
1 ts Freshly grated lemon zest

1 1/2 ts Vanilla

1 1/2 c  Raspberries, approx

For the crust:  In a bowl stir together the cookie crumbs and the
butter until the mixture is combined well, and pat the mixture onto
the bottom and 1/2 inch up the side of a 9 1/2 inch springform pan.
Chill the crust for 30 minutes.

For the Filling:  Preheat the oven to 325F.  In a bowl with an
electric mixer beat cream cheese until it is light and fluffy. Add
the sugar gradually, beating, and beat until the mixture is combined
well. Beat in the flour, add the eggs, 1 at a time and beating after
each addition, and beat in the sour cream, the zests, salt and
vanilla, beating the filling until it is combined well.

Pour the filling into the crust and bake the cheesecake in a foil
lined shallow baking pan in the middle of the oven for 1 hour and 10
minutes. The cake will not be completely set; it will set as it
cools. Turn the oven off and let the cake stand in the oven with the
oven door propped open about 6 inches until it is cooled completely.
Chill the cheesecake, covered, overnight.

Remove the sides of the pan.  Arrange the raspberries in a star shape
on the top of the cake, and arrange the blueberries around them to
cover the rest of the cake.
