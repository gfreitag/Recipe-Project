This sumptuous dish is a great favourite - layers of cauliflower,
mushrooms and rice are covered with a mustard and cheese sauce and
then browned in the oven. Serve with a mixed salad of your choice and
some warm bread to mop up the juices.

Slice the cauliflower finely. SautÂ‚ the mushrooms briskly in hot
olive oil until cooked through but still crisp. Make a layer of the
cauliflower in the bottom of a small, greased serving-dish, and cover
with a layer of rice. Continue with a layer of the mushrooms, and so
on, until the ingredients are used up. Cover with the sauce. Mix
together the breadcrumbs and grated cheese and sprinkle over the top.
Dot with butter or margarine and bake at 190 degrees C / 375 degrees
F / gas 5 for 20 minutes.
