Yield: 3 Servings
3    Bell peppers
1 c  Orzo
1/2 lb Portobello mushrooms, washed
And roughly
Chopped
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1 c  Dry white wine
1 bn Arugula -- stemmed and

Cut the stem ends off the peppers, reserving tops. Peppers can also be
sliced in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and membranes. Set aside
while making filling.

In a large stockpot, cook the orzo in boiling water for 15 to 20
minutes, until al dente. Drain.

In a large skillet, saute the mushrooms in the olive oil over
medium-high heat for five minutes. Add the wine and arugula and cook
for 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the orzo
and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Fill the prepared
peppers with the orzo mixture.

Preheat the oven to 375#161#F. Arrange the peppers upright on baking
sheets. Replace the tops if desired and roast for 25 to 40 minutes,
depending on size.
