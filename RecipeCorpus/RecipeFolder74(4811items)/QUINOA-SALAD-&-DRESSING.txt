SALAD: Rinse the quinoa thoroughly in a bowl of cold water. Then pour
into a fine-mesh strainer and rinse again under running water. Bring
2 cups of water to a boil, add salt, then stir in the quinoa. Lower
the heat, cover the pan and cook 15 minutes. Taste the grains--there
should be just a little resistance and the opaque, spiralled ring of
germ should show. If necessary, continue cooking until done, then
pour into a strainer and set aside to drain over a bowl. Toast the
pine nuts in a dry pan over medium heat until they are golden brown
and set them aside. Make the salad dressing and toss the warm quinoa
with the fruits, vegetables, pine nuts and dressing. Serve piled onto
a platter.

SALAD DRESSING: Combine lemon zest, juice, spices, herbs and salt
together in a bowl. Stir to combine, then whisk in the olive oil.
Taste and adjust the balance of flavors, adding lemon juice if
necessary. Serves 4, generously.
