Title: ROASTED GAME HENS WITH NEW POTATOES
Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
8    To 12 small (about 2-inch
-diameter) thin skinned
-potatoes, scrubbed
2    Cornish game hens (1 1/4 to
-1 1/2 lb. each)
2 tb Dijon mustard
2 tb Honey
1/4 c  Dry white wine or apple
-juice
1 tb Minced fresh or 1 teaspoon
-dry thyme leaves
Salt and pepper
Place potatoes in an 8- to 9-inch-square pan and set on a rack in
upper half of a 425F oven.  Bake for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, with kitchen scissors or a knife, split hens in half,
cutting along backbone and breastbone. Rinse and pat dry. Reserve
neck and giblets for another use. [Hardly! They'd go right into the
pan too... S.C.] Mix mustard, honey, wine and thyme.  Rub all over
hens.

Place hens, skin up, on a rack in a foil-lined 12- by 15-inch broiler
pan.

Set hens in bottom third of the oven.  Bake until potatoes are tender
when pierced and meat is no longer pink at thigh bone (cut to test),
25 to 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serves 4.

accompanying this with hot or cold artichokes, apple pie and Sauvignon
Blanc.
