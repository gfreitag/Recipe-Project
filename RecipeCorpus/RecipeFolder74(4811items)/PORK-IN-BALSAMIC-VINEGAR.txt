Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 md Onion; thinly sliced
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
3 tb Fresh rosemary
2 tb Fresh sage; minced
1 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
2/3 c  Balsamic vinegar
Juice from 1/2 lemon
1 tb Pink peppercorns
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
MMMMM-------------------------TENDERLOIN------------------------------
1 1/2 lb Boneless pork tenderloin
2 tb Olive oil; divided

2/3 c  Dry white wine; divided
For the marinade:  In a skillet, combine onion and cider vinegar and
simmer until the onion is soft.  Add rosemary, sage, parsley,
balsamic vinegar, juice of 1/2 lemon, pink peppercorns and
extra-virgin olive oil. Stir well, remove from heat and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375F.

Pat pork with paper towels and rub it all over with 1 Tbl of olive
oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.

In a frying pan, heat 1 Tbl olive oil over medium high heat and brown
the meat on all sides.  Transfer the meat to a baking dish and add
1/3 cup dry white wine to the dish. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or
until cooked to 155F to 160F.  Midway through the cooking add another
1/3 cup wine to the pan.

Transfer the meat to a deep non-metal dish just large enough to hold
it. Pour the marinade over the meat, and let it marinate, covered, in
the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or up to 3 days. Bring the
meat, in the marinade, to room temperature before serving. Cut it in
thin slices, arrange on a serving platter, and spoon some of the
marinade over the slices.

Of course this dish can also be reheated in the marinade and served
warm.
