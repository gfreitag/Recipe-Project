Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Prepare mashed potatoes. Keep warm.

enough to hold both racks, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil. When hot,
brown the lamb on all sides.  Transfer to the preheated oven, and
cook for ten minutes.

Meanwhile heat the remaining one tablespoon of oil over medium heat.
Add the bangers and cook while the lamb is roasting, being careful to
cook them evenly. after 10 minutes, remove the lamb from the oven,
and brush with the BBQ sauce.  Return the lamb to the oven and roast
an additional 15 minutes for medium rare (5 ~ 10 minutes longer for
medium). Divide the mashed potatoes on each plate, carve the lamb
into chops and place 3 chops on the potatoes and 2 bangers on each
plate.
