1/3 c  Water
TO MAKE CAKE:   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. With a pastry
brush or paper towel, coat an 11x17 inch jelly-roll pan with the
butter. This will seem like a lot; be very generous. Sprinkle the
flour or cocoa over the butter and shake the pan to coat the butter
fully. Tap the edge of the pan on a table to knock out the excess
flour. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or a bowl over a pan of
simmering water. Set aside to cool to lukewarm.

Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until the whites cling to the
beater. Add about 1/4 cup of the sugar and beat until the whites form
stiff, unwavering peaks. Cream the butter and the other (about) 1/4
cup of the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the
melted chocolate and beat in the egg yolks one at a time.

With a rubber spatula, stir about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into
the chocolate mixture, then pour the chocolate mixture over the rest
of the whites. Sprinkle the flour lightly on top. Gently fold the
mixture together until no white streaks remain. Pour the batter into
the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake in
the middle of the oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the cake
shrinks slightly away from the sides of the pan and a knife inserted
in the middle comes out clean. It will still be very flat. Loosen the
cake from the pan with a sharp knife around the sides and turn it out
onto a rack to cool. (Put the rack over the pan and flip the whole
thing over to keep the cake from breaking.)

TO MAKE FILLING:  In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the cream and
chocolate and stir over medium heat until the chocolate dissolves.
Then reduce the heat to very low and simmer, stirring constantly,
until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a pudding. Pour it
into a bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

When the mixture is very cold, pour in the rum and vanilla and beat
with a whisk or beater until the filling is smooth and creamy and
forms soft peaks when the beater is lifted. Do not over-beat or you
will get butter. (If this should happen, don't despair; chocolate
buttercream makes a perfectly fine filling.)

Cut the cake in half to make two layers, each about 8 1/2 inches wide.
Spread the filling over one layer and set the other layer on top.
Smooth out the edges with a spatula. If one of the cake layers should
break, use it on the bottom. Refrigerate on a rack for about 1 hour.
