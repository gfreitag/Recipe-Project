In a large saucepan combine the potatoes and enough salted cold water
to cover them by 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil, and boil the
potatoes, covered, for 4 minutes. Add the celery root, simmer the
vegetables, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are very
tender, and drain them well. While the vegetables are still hot force
them through a food mill fitted with the medium disk into a saucepan.

Add the butter, milk, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and stir the puree
well. (The puree may be made up to 1 day in advance and kept covered
and chilled.) In a heavy saucepan reheat the puree over low heat,
stirring constantly, until it is hot.
