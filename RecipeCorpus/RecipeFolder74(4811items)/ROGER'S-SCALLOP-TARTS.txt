Title: ROGER'S SCALLOP TARTS
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
12    Tiny pastry cases (about
-3cm across)
12 md Scallops
2    Cloves garlic
5 oz Full fat cream cheese
The juice of half a lemon
Oil for frying
Caviar to decorate.
Separate the corals of the scallops from the bodies. Chop the garlic
and fry it in a little oil until done, but not browned. Add the
scallop corals briefly until just cooked. Blend contents of the pan
with the cream cheese, preferably in a blender, until it is very
smooth. Season and add in some of the lemon juice to taste.

Place a little of the cheese mixture into each pastry case.

Slice each scollop into two or three disks about 0.5 cm thick, and
marinade them for anout 10 mins in the lemon juice. Lightly fry the
scallops, lay on the pastry cases, and decorate with caviar.

Serve immediately.

This is absolutely delicious - makes a nice light starter or an
amuse-bouche for a longer meal.
