Categories: Desserts
Yield: 9 Servings
2/3 c  Gran. sugar ( for caramel )
1/4 c  Drk brn sugar (for caramel)
5    Eggs
2    Egg yolks
4 c  Half & half
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Vanilla extract
*RUM AND BRANDY SYRUP*
1 c  Granulated sugar
6 oz Water
1 oz Brandy
1 tb Rum Extract
Servings:  9

Have a 2 quart pudding dish, or 9 single serving dishes ready. Be
sure they are dry. Melt and carmelize the 2/3 cup sugar,and the 1/4
cup brown sugar in a heavy skillet. When sugar melts and turns a dark
golden color (about 5 min.) pour into the custard dishes and tilt
back and forth with a swirling motion to cover bottom and sides of
dish. It may be necessary to spread the caramel with a spoon. Set
aside and allow to cool. Beat eggs and the egg yolks into the half
and half. Add the salt and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves. Add
vanilla. Strain, and pour into prepared custard dish. Preheat oven to
325 degrees. Set dish in a pan of hot water and bake, covered with
foil. Bake the large custard about 1 1/2 hrs. or until a knife
inserted in center comes out clean. The smaller ones will cook about
1 hr. Perform knife test as above. Remove from the oven and allow to
cool slightly. Place a round rimmed platter over the large flan or a
serving plate over each of the single serving flans and flip them
over slowly. Do this carefully, as the caramelized syrup will pour
out as the flan releases from the container. Cool and serve. I
sometimes garnish with pecan halves.

***** Rum and Brandy Syrup *****

Caramelize the sugar in a heavy skillet. Add water and stir until the
caramel is dissolved. Boil until quite thick. Add the Brandy and Rum
extract and stir until combined. Cool and serve with the flan for
those who desire additional syrup with a slightly different flavor.
