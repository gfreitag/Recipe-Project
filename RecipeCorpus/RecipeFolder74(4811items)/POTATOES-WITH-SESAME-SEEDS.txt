Title: POTATOES WITH SESAME SEEDS
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Potatoes, cooked, peeled,
3/4-inch dice
x  Cumin seeds
x  Black mustard seeds
x  Sesame seeds
x  Salt
x  Cayenne
x  Lemon juice
There should be equal amounts cumin and black mustard seeds, and
plenty more sesame seeds.  Only a little lemon juice - it has a
strong flavor. Cayenne has an _extremely_ intense flavor, so use it
judiciously. Heat some oil in a pan.  When hot, throw in all the
seeds. When the black mustard seeds begin popping, throw in the
potatoes and other spices. Cook until the potatoes are as done as you
like them.
