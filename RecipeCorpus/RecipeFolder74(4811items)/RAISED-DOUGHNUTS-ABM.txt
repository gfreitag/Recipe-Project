Title: RAISED DOUGHNUTS ABM
Categories: Breads, Cyberealm, Kooknet, Desserts
Yield: 18 Doughnuts
1/2 c  Warm Water
3    Eggs
3 tb Unsalted Butter; softened
2 tb Dry Nonfat Milk
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Mace
1 tb Baking Powder
1/2 ts Salt
3 c  Flour
1 tb Yeast
1/2 c  Powdered Sugar
Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for knead and first
rise and press start. At the end of the final cycle, transfer the
dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and place
in a warm, draft-free place, and allow to rise for an additional 30
minutes. You can also do this step in the machine by punching the
dough down, closing the machine, and letting the dough rise for 30
minutes.

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut it in half to
make it more manageable. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Roll it
out to 1/3" thick.  Flour a doughnut cutter and cut out doughnuts.
Lift each doughnut, pat it to remove excess flour, and place it on a
lightly oiled or sprayed baking sheet.  Cover the doughnuts with a
clean towel and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Put 1/2 cup powdered sugar in sturdy paper bag and spread out paper
towels near frying pan.  Heat 2" oil in a medium saucepan or deep
fryer to 375Ã¸F. Slide 2 or 3 doughnuts at a time into the hot oil.
Turn them frequently and spoon the hot oil over them until they are
well puffed. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels and shake them with
the sugar in the bag while they are still warm.
