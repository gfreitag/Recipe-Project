Title: ROASTED POTATOES WITH OLIVES
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Yukon Gold -- Finnish or
Red
Rose, peeled and cut into
1    Inch chunks
1 tb Plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher
Salt
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Picholine olives
1 tb Finely chopped garlic
Freshly ground pepper
Preheat the oven to 400-degrees.  In a large saucepan, cover the
potatoes with 2 quarts of water.  Add 1 tablespoon of the salt and
bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes
are almost tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain the potatoes in a
colander and let them dry in their own steam for
10    minutes.

Transfer the potatoes to a rimmed baking sheet and gently toss them
with the olive oil. Roast the potatoes in the oven for about 1 hour,
turning them every so often with a flat spatula, until golden brown.

Pour off any excess oil in the pan.  Scatter the olives and garlic
over the potatoes and toss.  Lower the oven temperature to
350-degrees and bake the potatoes for 10 minutes longer.  Sprinkle
them with the remaining salt and a little fresh pepper and serve
piping hot.
