Very few cities love a party more than San Antonio, Texas. A major
part of San Antonio's annual Fiesta is a celebration called "Night in
Old San Antonio", held in La Villita, the restored original little
village of San Antonio. It's impossible to eat a sample of all of the
foods sold, at least for the normal person, but one of the most
popular is anticuchos--chunks of beef that have been marinated in a
secret pepper marinade, skewered, and grilled over an open fire.
Since nobody has offered a recipe, I made one up. Since you are going
to hand a skewer full of meat to each guest, you really should hand
them a cold beer for the other hand to preserve proper balance.

Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive (not metal) dish and allow
to marinate for one to two hours. Divide meat evenly between four
skewers, and grill over very hot coals for 1-2 minutes per side (4-8
minutes total cooking time_, basting with the remaining marinade at
each turning. You may wish to cook the meat longer if you prefer it
beyond medium rare. You can also reduce the size of the servings and
use this recipe for hot hors d'oeuvres.
