beans, cucumber, scallion, 2 tablespoon olive oil, green pepper,
cilantro, lime juice and jalapeno; add salt to taste.

Halve the potatoes lengthwise and, using a teaspoon, carefully remove
all but 1/8"-1/4" of the potato, leaving the skin intact. Reserve the
insides of the potatoes for another use. Brush the inside of the
potato shells lightly with the 1 teaspoon olive oil. Preheat the
broiler. Place the potato skins cut side up on a baking sheet and
broil 3-4" from the flame for 5 minutes. Turn the skins over and
broil on the other side for 1 minute.

cheese is melted. Serve immediatelty.
