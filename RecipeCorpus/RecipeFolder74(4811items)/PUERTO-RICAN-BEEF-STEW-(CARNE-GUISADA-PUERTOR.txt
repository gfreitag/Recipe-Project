I love Puerto Rican Food!... It's usually simple, yet rich with lots
of cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can
be simplified to taste. I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and
garlic with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).

I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it
interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).

In a large heavy kettle, brown meat in oil.

Add green pepper, sweet chili, onions, cloves, cilantro, vinegar (or
lime juice), oregano, tomato sauce, bay leaves, and salt. Mix and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 1 hour.

Add carrots to kettle.  Drain liquid from peas into kettle and mix
(reserve peas)   Bring rapidly to a boil, reduce to low, cover and
cook about 1 hr until meat is almost fork-tender..

Add potatoes, olives, capers, raisins, and 1/2 tsp salt, bring
rapidly to a boil,  reduce heat to low, cover and cook about 1 hour,
or until meat is fork-tender and  vegetables are done.

Ad reserved peas and mix.  Taste and adjust seasoning (uncover, and
boil to thicken sauce to taste).
