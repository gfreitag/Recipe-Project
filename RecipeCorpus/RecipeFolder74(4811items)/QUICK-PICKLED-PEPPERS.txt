1.  Heat the water, vinegar, and salt to boiling in medium saucepan.
Reduce heat and simmer covered until salt is completely dissolved,
about 3 minutes.

2.  Rinse peppers well.  Cut in half through stems; remove stems,
seeds, and white pith.  Cut each half lengthwise into thirds. Lightly
press garlic with flat of knife and peel. Pack peppers, garlic,
celery, and herb sprig into hot clean 1 quart canning jar.

3.  Fill jar with hot vinegar mixture.  Slip thin rubber spatula down
sides of jar to release air bubbles. Add more vinegar mixture if
needed. Seal jar with new canning lid.  Store in cool dark place or
in refrigerator at least 1 week before serving.  Flavor improves with
longer storage.

(Note:  table salt can be used, but it may make brine cloudy)
