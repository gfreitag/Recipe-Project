Title: RABBIT A LA DANIELLE
Categories: French, Main dish, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ea Large domestic rabbit
1 x  Salt
3 ea 1/2 pints of whipping cream
1 x  Pepper
Bake in an open casserole at 325F. for two to three hours. The oval
French glazed earthenware casserole dishes are the best. A large New
Zealand Red rabbit or one that size is the best. This will fill a
large casserole dish. The French remove the eyes, but leave the head
attached. Sounds gross to American tastes, but the head has some of
the tenderest meat on the rabbit and surprisingly a large amount.
French children (mine as well) fight over who gets the head. Serve
with roasted carrots and potatoes. Danielle says that since she is
not a good cook and hates to cook, this dish is easy to prepare and
serve. It still has that marvelous French flair that is incomparable.
Oh yes, serve also with crusty baguettes of French bread and a very
dry Chardonnay.  Come to think of it, a good dry Cabernet Sauvignon
or Pinot Noir wouldn't be bad either.
