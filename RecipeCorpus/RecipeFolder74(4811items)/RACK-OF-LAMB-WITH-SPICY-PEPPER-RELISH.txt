grill above a solid bed of medium-hot coals (you can hold your hand
at grill level only 3-4 seconds). Turn to brown evenly and cook to
doneness desired. For rare (140'F. on a thermometer inserted in a
thickest part), allow 1-20 minutes total. Just before removing from
grill, burn 2 sprigs rosemary or all the dried leaves on coals under
lamb; takes about
1    minute.
