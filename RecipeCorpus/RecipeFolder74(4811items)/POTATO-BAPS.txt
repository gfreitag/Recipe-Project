Cook potato in saucepan of boiling water until tender. Drain; reserve

degrees. Mash potato in large bowl. Mix in 2 cups flour, yeast and
salt. Add reserved 1/2 cup warm cooking liquid and stir to combine.
Mix in enough remaining flour to form soft dough. Turn out dough onto
lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10
minutes. Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat. Cover
and let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume,
about 1 1/2 hours. Lightly flour heavy large baking sheet. Punch down
dough. Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough into
6 pieces. Roll each piece into smooth ball. Arrange on prepared
baking sheet, spacing evenly. Cover with towel and let rise until
light and puffy, about 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Using
rolling pin, gently flatten each ball of dough into 4-inch round.
Sprinkle lightly with flour. Bake until rolls are golden brown and
sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 20 minutes. Transfer rolls
to rack and cool completely.Subj: Maslin Rolls POTATO BAPS
