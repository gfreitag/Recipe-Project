Title: RASPBERRY MERINGUE CAKE
Categories: Desert
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/8 c  Flour
Slightly more than 1/2 cup
Butter
1 tb Sugar
pn Salt
1 1/2 oz Cocoa
Mix flour and softened butter, sugar, salt and chocolate with a wooden
spoon in a large bowl.  Lay in and 8 inch glass oven dish, covering
the bottom and sides as though it were a pie. (It is very crumbly
because it is so short.) (Meaning short pastry.)  Put in preheat 300F
oven for 15 minutes.  (The cake will be half-cooked when you remove
it.)

Then make the following meringue:

3    egg whites 1 cup sugar
1/2    teaspoon wine vinegar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 pint fresh
raspberries

With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites, sugar and vinegar for 10
minutes at high speed.  Add vanilla and beat another 5 minutes. Fold
the cleaned raspberries into the meringue. Fill the half-cooked cake
with the meringue and put in oven for another 15 to 20 minutes at
250F.

***The original form of this cake used fresh currants, but as they are
rarely available the Marquesa substituted raspberries.

Dustings on the top of this cake would only add to its presentation. A
dusting of chocolate powder, I think.
