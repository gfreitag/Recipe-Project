Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Jewish
Yield: 12 Servings
1 x  Filling:
1 c  Ground pecans
1 c  Currants
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1 x  Dough:
8 oz Cream cheese; room temperatu
2 c  All purpose flour
1 c  Butter; room temp.
2 tb Sugar
1 x  Flour
12 oz Jar apricot jam
For filling: combine pecans, currants, sugar and cinnamon in mixing
bowl. For dough: combine cream cheese, flour, butter and sugar in
processor or mixer and blend well. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Dust
each with flour, shaking off excess. Roll each piece between sheets
of waxed paper into 10" circle. Refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to
375. Grease baking sheets. Spread each circle of dough with apricot
jam. Divide filling among circles, spreading evenly. Cut each into 12
wedges. Roll up each wedge from bottom to point. Arrange on prepared
sheets, point side down. Bake until golden, about 16-17 minutes.
Transfer to wire rack and let cool. Store cookies in airtight
container. Tips: Be sure to work on just one circle at a time and
keep others refrigerated. Don't overdo the jam and cinnamon/pecan
filling because they tend to overflow and will burn quickly on your
baking sheets. Remove at once from the baking sheet to cool on racks
when they turn golden brown on top. After rolling out between waxed
paper, one hour of cooling is perfect to cut out, but they may be
made ahead and refrigerated longer. Just leave them out a bit before
cutting out so dough won't be so stiff to handle properly and roll
well. P.S. I loved the directions, and the results. You know success
when others ask for the recipe.
