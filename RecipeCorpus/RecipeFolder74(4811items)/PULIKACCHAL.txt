Squeeze out the pulp from the tamarind. You can add a little fresh
water each time to extract the pulp. When you have a about a small
bowl full, set aside.

Warm oil, season with mustard seeds first. When they start to pop
throw in red chillies, chana dal, hing and curry leaves. When dal
turns red, add the green chillies and fry. Throw in the ginger, add
tamarind extract carefully, a pinch turmeric, salt to taste and
jaggery. Simmer on low heat till raw smell disappears and the sauce
has reduced to one- third or thickened yet spoonable.

Crush the roasted sesame seeds with a rolling pin on paper or in a
spice mill rather coarsely. Add this at the end to the pulikacchal.
Mix well so there are no lumps.
