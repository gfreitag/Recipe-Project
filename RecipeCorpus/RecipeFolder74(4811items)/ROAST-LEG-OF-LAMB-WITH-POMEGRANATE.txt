Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Semi-boneless Leg of Lamb
-- (2 1/4 lbs)
3 c  Pomegranate juice
1/4 c  Country dijon mustard

Check out our juice aisle for pomegranate juice. (Cranberry juice can
be used in its place). The marinade imparts great flavor to the lamb
and provides a tangy, rich sauce. Combine pomegranate juice, mustard,
garlic. Completely submerge lamb in marinade. Marinate for 2-3 days.
Remove lamb from marinade, save marinade. Place lamb in oven-proof
dish, place in preheated 350 oven. Roast for 1 hour, 15 minutes. Let
lamb rest outside the oven for 15 minutes before serving. As soon as
the lamb is in the oven, strain the marinade twice through a fine
mesh sieve. Place in small saucepan, bring to a boil, simmer for 1
hour and 15 minutes. Serve with sliced lamb.
