1    20 lb. turkey, thawed
Preheat oven to 325ø. Thaw turkey (20 lb. turkey will thaw in approx.

retainer down by tail, then remove neck from body cavity. Remove
giblet packet from neck cavity. Put these in saucepan, cover w/ 2-3
cups water and simmer for 1 hour or more. Rinse turkey well and
drain, returning to refrigerator until needed. After 1/2 hour of
giblets cooking, dice celery and onion. Fry sausage, crumbling, until
completely done. Add celery and onion and 1/2 cup water to fry pan
and let simmer 10 minutes. Using your roasting pan, empty 2 boxes of
croutons into it. Add sausage/celery/onion mix. Melt 1/2 cup butter
and add.  Add tsp. of poultry seasoning. Add 2 cups of giblet broth.
Stir well until croutons are evenly moistened. Rinse turkey again,
shake out excess water.  Stuff body cavity with stuffing LOOSELY (do
not pack in or turkey will explode.. stuffing expands when cooking!)
and put legs back into retainer to hold together. Stuff neck cavity.
Fold wing tips behind bird's back, use to hold neck skin down so
stuffing won't fall out from neck. Rinse out roasting pan and line
with foil. Coat foil with vegetable oil. Coat turkey, all over, with
vegetable oil. Place in roasting pan. Add any excess stuffing that
will fit on top of turkey legs at body cavity opening, laying on top.

thigh without touching thermometer to bone, and same at thickest part
of the breast. Baste turkey with baster last 2 hours, about every 15
minutes. If skin is getting too dark, tent with foil.
