Title: RED SNAPPER WITH CITRUS
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Shallots, or white part of 4
Scallions
1/4 c  Loosely packed fresh parsley
Leaves
8 oz Fresh mushrooms
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/2 c  Bottled clam juice
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 oz Red snapper, perch, turbot
Or sole fillets
1. Peel and mince shallots (or trim and thinly slice scallions).
Rinse and mince parsley. Trim mushrooms, wipe clean with a damp paper
towel and thinly slice (you'll have about 2 cups).

2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and
cook for about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and cook a moment more to
soften slightly. Add juices and bring to a boil.

3. Cover skillet and simmer gently 5 to 7 minutes until mushrooms are
completely tender. Uncover and boil over high heat about 5 minutes
until liquid is somewhat thickened. Season with half the salt and
pepper.

4. Place fish fillets over mushrooms. Sprinkle with remaining salt and
pepper. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and steam fillets 6 to 8
minutes until just opaque in center (or bake covered at 350 for 15
minutes). Sprinkle fish with parsley and serve immediately.
