Title: POTTY JELLO
Categories: New, Text, Import
*****  NONE  *****
Yield: 1 Servings  :

Purchase the plastic bowl that fits in a child's potty training chair
(they sell them at places like KMart). Wash the bowl and prepare
lemon jello per package directions. Float miniature O-Henry bars in
it, refrigerate, and serve.  Get the picture?

Next fun recipe.  Have you ever seen a recipe for Aquarium Jello? You
take blue jello, make it in a clean glass aquarium bowl. Float gummy
fish and plastic people for swimmers and plastic plants and stuff.
Well, what we'd do for a Halloween party would be to make a Toxic
Aquarium. Mix orange and blue jello to get a sickly shade of green.
Lifesavers make old tires and you can toss in other junky things for
trash on the bottom of the sea. Something barrel-shaped for that
illegally dumped toxic waste. Float your fish upsidedown on top, and
add a plastic skeleton or two. Haven't figured out a good way to put
something on the bottom to represent the sand, tho.
