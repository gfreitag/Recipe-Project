Categories: Meat entree, Pastas and
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Whole onion -- chopped
3 tb Olive oil
2    Cloves garlic -- chopped
1/2 lb Lamb -- ground
1 ts Dried oregano
2 tb Fresh parsley -- chopped
1 tb Tomato paste
1 c  Chicken broth
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper -- to taste
1 lb Rigatoni (durum wheat
Pasta)
1/4 c  Fresh mint leaves --
Chopped
3/4 c  Feta cheese -- crumbled
1 1/2 tb Olive oil -- optional
3 tb Pine nuts -- toasted
In a heavy saucepan, saute the onion in the 3 Tablespoon. oil over
low heat for 3 to 4 min.

Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for less than a minute; then add
the lamb and oregano. Cook the lamb over high heat, stirring
frequently to break up the lumps, until it has just lost its raw
color.

Stir in the parsley, tomato paste and chicken broth. Season with salt
and pepper. Bring to a simmer, place cover on slightly askew and cook
over low heat for 15 min.

While the sauce is cooking, bring a large kettle of water to a boil.
When the water is boiling furiously, add 1 Tablespoon. salt; add the
rigatoni and stir once or twice. Boil the pasta for 8 to 10 min., or
until tender-firm to the bite.

Turn the pasta into a colander, drain well, then transfer to a large
warmed bowl.  Pour over the sauce, add the mint, feta cheese, pine
nuts, and optional 1
1/2    Tablespoon. of olive oil.

Toss again and serve piping hot.
