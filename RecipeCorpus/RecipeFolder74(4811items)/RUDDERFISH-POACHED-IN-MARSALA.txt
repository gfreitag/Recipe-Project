Stephen Ceideburg
4    Pieces Rudderfish
1 tb Olive oil
2    Cloves garlic, finely
-chopped
1 tb Chopped parsley
1/2 c  Marsala
1    Orange, juice and zest
1/4 c  Fish stock
Fish stock can be made when you have the time, frozen in ice- cube
trays, then the cubes transferred to a freezer bag for storage until
you need them. If worst comes to the worst, the Knorr brand has
instant fish-stock cubes, which can often be found in the "exotic"
section of large supermarkets.

In a pan large enough to take 4 serving size pieces of rudderfish in
one layer, heat a tablespoon of olive oil and gently fry 2 finely
chopped cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of chopped parsley. Add
half a cup of marsala. the juice and zest of an orange and a quarter
cup of fish stock. Bring to a simmer and slide in 4 serving-size
pieces of rudder fish. Poach just until the fish flakes, turning once
if necessary, and remove the pieces to warmed plates. Turn up the
heat to high and boil the liquid fiercely till it has reduced by at
least half

Pour the sauce over the fish and serve.
