To roast the vegetables for the ragu, preheat an oven to 450F (230C).
Put the butternut squash in a baking pan and place in the center of
the oven. Bake, uncovered, until soft butnot mushy when pierced, about
1    hour.

About 40 minutes before that squash is ready, place all the other
vegetables in a large baking pan keeping each vegetable separate, and
cover with aluminum foil. Place the second baking pan in the oven and
bake for 15-20 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until tender
when pierced with a fork, 20-25 minutes longer. Remove all the
vegetables from the oven and let cool.

Peel the butternut squash. Cut the squash; turnip, parsnip or
rutabaga; zucchini; eggplant; bell pepper; and tomatoes into 1 inch
dice. Thinly slice the leek crosswise, and quarter the mushrooms.
Keep the vegetables separate.

To make the ragu, in a saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil.
Add the turnip, parsnip or rutabaga and leek and saute for 1 minute.
Raise the heat to high and add the zucchini, eggplant, bell pepper
and mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Add the squash and saute for 1
minute. Add the tomatoes and saute for 1 minute longer.

Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and
simmer until the flavors are blended, 2-3 minutes. Add the wine and
simmer for 1 minute longer. Season to taste with salt and black
pepper. Keep warm.

To make the polenta, in a deep saucepan over high heat, bring that
water and butter to a boil. Slowly pour in the polenta while stirring
continuously with a whisk. Allow the mixture to bubble, whisking
constantly, Cook 1-2 minutes as it thickens. Reduce the heat to low
and continue to simmer, whisking constantly to prevent burning and
lumps from forming, until the polenta grains swell and are tender
like porridge, about 5 minutes for quick-cooking polenta and 20
minutes for regular polenta or according to package directions.
Duringthe last few minutes of cooking, stir in the herbs and cheese
and season to taste with salt and white pepper.

To serve:  Ladle the polenta onto warmed individual plates. Make a
well in the center of each serving, ladle the ragu over the top.
Serves 4 to 6.
