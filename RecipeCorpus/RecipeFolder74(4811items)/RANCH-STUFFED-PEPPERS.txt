1 c  Ground Veal
3    Green Onions, Chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Slice the tops off all the bell
peppers and set aside. Remove the seeds and membranes. Dice the
second measure of red bell peppers. Combine the diced red bell pepper
and the ground veal (you may substitute ground chicken for the veal).
Add the green onions, the Jalapeno peppers and the garlic. Stir in
the soft cream cheese and blend in with a wooden spoon. Stir in the
egg and the half & half. Add the grated cheese. Season with the
cumin, salt and pepper. Place the pepper shells in a baking dish
which will hold them snugly together. Spoon the filling into the
peppers. Replace the tops. Pour several (3-4) tablespoons of water
around the peppers. Bake until the filling is puffed and the peppers
are soft (about 40 minutes). Serve at once.
