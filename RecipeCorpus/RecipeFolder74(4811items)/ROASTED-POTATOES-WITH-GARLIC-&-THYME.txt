Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Leaving their skins on, scrub the
potatoes with a brush to remove any dirt or blemishes. Dry the
potatoes with paper towels or a cloth. Cut the potatoes in half or in
quarters, depending on their size. Pour the olive oil into a roasting
pan or large cast-iron skillet and heat in the oven 10 minutes before
adding the potatoes.

Roast the potatoes 45 minutes, until crisp. Shake the pan several
times during cooking, so that the potatoes roll around to brown
evenly. Remove from the oven. Drain the potatoes on paper towels or a
cloth to absorb the excess oil, then place in a serving dish.

In a saute pan, melt the butter, then add the garlic and saute until
light golden brown. Add the chopped herbs to the garlic butter, stir
together quickly, and remove from the heat. Pour the garlic-herb
butter over the potatoes, season with the salt and pepper, and serve.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
