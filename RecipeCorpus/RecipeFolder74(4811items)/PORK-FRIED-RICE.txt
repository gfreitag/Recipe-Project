Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Egg
1 tb Water
Salt
Oil
1/2 lb Lean pork, cut in thin strip
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Sliced green onions with top
1/2 c  Sliced celery
3 c  Cold cooked rice
1 c  Bean sprouts
3 tb Soy sauce
2    Eggs, beaten
Chopped cooked pork
Green Onion Brushes (see Note) Combine egg, water and 1/8 teaspoon
salt and beat. Heat wok or large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2
teaspoons oil and pour in egg mixture. Tilt pan to coat surface. Cook
until pancake is set and bottom is slightly golden. Turn and cool,
then roll up tightly and slice crosswise into slivers. Set aside.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in wok or large skillet. Add pork, season with
sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir-fry over high heat until browned
and cooked. Add green onions and celery and cook until crisp-tender.
Add rice and bean sprouts and cook until rice is heated through,
stirring to mix with meat and vegetables. Add soy sauce and stir to
mix. Make well in center of rice, pour in beaten eggs, allow to set
then scramble with chopsticks and stir into rice. Or heat 1
tablespoon oil in separate pan, pour in eggs and allow to set,
pushing set portion aside to allow uncooked egg to run underneath.
Cut into strips and stir into rice. Turn rice out onto platter and
top with chopped cooked pork and slivered egg. Make border of Green
Onion Brushes around rice. Note: To make Green Onion Brushes, select
large green onions. Cut off root ends, leaving as much white part as
possible. Cut onions in 3-inch lengths. Place on board and using
sharp knife, make slashes lengthwise from each end, cutting 1/2 inch
toward center. Place in bowl of cold water and onions will open up
and curl back. Chill in water 1 hour or overnight. Drain well before
using.
