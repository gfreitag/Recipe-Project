3 1/2 c  Milk
1 c  White Rice; cooked
3    Eggs; slightly beaten
1/3 c  -Granulated Sugar
2 ts -Vanilla
1/2 c  Golden Seedless Raisins

2 tb Butter
3 tb Bourbon OR Dark Rum
1/2 c  Sweetened Whipped Cream
Rice Pudding with Bourbon 4 to 6 hours

I make this with leftover rice, but you can start from scratch by
cooking 1/2 cup raw rice as directed on the package.

To Cook:  Warm the milk and pour it over the rice. Into the eggs,
beat the sugar, vanilla, raisins, and lemon rind. Stir the milk and
rice into the egg mixture. Scrape into the slow cooker. Sprinkle with
nutmeg and dot with butter. Cover and cook on Low for 4 to 6 hours.
Turn into a serving bowl and stir in the bourbon. Serve the pudding
lukewarm with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream on top. Makes 6 to
8 servings.
