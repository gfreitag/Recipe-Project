Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Holiday, Preserves
Yield: 2 Servings
3 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
2 1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Poppy seeds
3    Eggs
1 1/8 c  Cooking oil
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 1/2 ts Almond extract
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 ts Butter flavoring
1/2 ts Almond flavoring
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 c  Orange juice
3/4 c  Powdered sugar (sifted)
Blend all cake ingredients together with a mixer. Pour into greased
loaf 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.
Yield: 2 loaves GLAZE: Mix all glaze ingredients together. Pour over
bread when it is done. NOTE: I use orange/pineapple juice instead of
plain orange juice. I've had it made either way and like both
versions equally. I just happen to buy the juice blend regularly and
seldom buy plain orange juice. (Nancy) TO BAKE IN JARS: Grease 5
wide-mouth pint canning jars. Divide dough evenly between jars. (Jars
will be slightly over 1/2 full.) Bake at 325 degrees for 50 minutes.
Pull jars out of oven 1 at a time. Pour glaze over hot bread.
Immediately apply and firmly tighten a two-piece wide-mouth canning
lid. The lid will form a vacuum seal as the jar cools. Jars of canned
bread may be stored on the pantry shelf with other canned foods or
may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is safe to eat as long as jars
remain vacuum sealed and free of mold growth. (Nancy)
