Title: RICE PUDDING DR. FAGLEY
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 qt Milk
1 tb Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Rice, washed
This is a recipe from mom's childhood.  The directions use tea cups,
lumps of butter the size of a walnut and rice (washed but not
precooked.) This is not a sweet dessert but a side dish to be served
at family reunions with turkey, chicken, and as an alternate to
potatoes. The directions suggest putting together in a slow oven for
about 1 hour. Stir in the brown top from time to time.

The recipe came from my Grest Aunt Kate and was a favorite at parties
in Greenwich Village in the 1920's.
