2 tb Flour

1 ts Prepared mustard

Let the meat stand at room temperature for 8 hours then marinade the
venison over night in the refrigerator. This opens the pores of the
meat when at room temp and when cooling will draw in the marinade.
Season with salt, roll in flour and brown in hot skillet. Place in
crock-pot cooker and add remaining ingredients. Cover and cook on low
10 to 12 hours.

cover venison with water. No need to stir this marinade. Use for
"red" meats or game birds.
