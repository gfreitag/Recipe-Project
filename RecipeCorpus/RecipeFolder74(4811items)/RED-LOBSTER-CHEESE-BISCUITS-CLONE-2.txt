Title: RED LOBSTER CHEESE BISCUITS CLONE 2
Categories: Biscuits, Breads, Copycat
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Bisquick? baking mix
1/2 c  Cold water
3/4 c  Sharp cheddar cheese; grated
1/4 c  Butter
1 ts Parsley
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Italian seasoning
Bake 450 for 8-10 minutes, brush with the butter and spices - you
know the drill.

"Folks a wonderful person sent me the 'actual' recipe from Red
Lobster, so here it is. Its a lot easier than mine, so please give it
at try. The basic recipe is broken down for household rather than
their huge batch.

However, you cannot make the EXACT biscuits, because they have a
special butter/garlic sauce that is not available to the general
public. See how they are!!"

I haven't tried these yet, but the original are my favorite biscuits.
