I, too, love knowing that my dinner is already cooking ~- even on
days that I don't work (outside the home, that is!). I have fallen
into the trap of making two recipes over and over. One or the other
is always simmering when out-of-town guests are expected.  (My
husband's family is notorious for showing up later than expected.
Crock pot meals are fabulous for times when you don't know when
dinner will be served!) Put the veggies on the bottom and the meat on
top. Season meat with salt and pepper. Pour water over all. Simmer
all of the above on low all day. Sometimes I add an envelope of onion
soup mix or a small can of whole tomatoes for a variation. The meat
falls apart and is wonderful! FROM: BARBARA NIXON (GKDR92A)
