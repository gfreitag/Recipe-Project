Title: POTATO LATKES (PART 2 OF 2)
Categories: Jewish, Vegetables, Holiday
Yield: 10 Servings  1.  Peel the potatoes if the skin is coarse; otherwise, just clean
them well.  Keep them in cold water until ready to prepare the
latkes. 2. Starting with the onions, alternately grate some of the
onions on the large holes of the grater and some of the potatoes on
the smallest holes. This will keep the potato mixture from
blackening. Press out as much liquid as possible and reserve the
starchy sediment at the bottom of the bowl. Return the sediment to
the mixture.* 3. Blend potatoes with the eggs, flour, salt and white
pepper. 4.  Heat 1" of oil in a frying pan. Drop about 1 tbs of
mixture for each latke into the skillet and fry, turning once. When
golden and crisp on each side, drain on paper towels. Serve with
yoghurt, sour cream, sugar, or applesauce. Serves, 8-10. Note: You
can freeze potato latkes.  After making them, place them on a cookie
sheet, freeze, and remove to a plastic bag. When ready to serve,
place in a 450F oven for several minutes.

*The steel blade of a food processor or the grating blade are less
painful ways of grating the potatoes and the onions. The blade makes
a smooth consistency and the grater a crunchy one.
