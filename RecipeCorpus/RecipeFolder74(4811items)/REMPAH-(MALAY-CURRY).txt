Title: REMPAH (MALAY CURRY)
Categories: Indian, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
12 oz Sweet Potato -- (red) *
12 oz White Yam -- peeled & cubed
1    In
1 lg Onion -- peeled and diced
6    Garlic Cloves
1    To 6 Green Chillies -- (to
-taste)
1    Red  Capsicum Pepper-seeded
2    Inch Cube Fresh Ginger
6 tb Vegetable Oil -- or ghee
3 oz To 4 Oz. Milk
3 1/2 oz Creamed Coconut
3 tb Dessicated Coconut
2 tb Tamarind Puree -- (or
Tamarind sauce)
-----Spices-----
1 ts Coriander Seed -- ground
1/2 ts Ground Cumin
1/2 ts Chinese Five-Spice Powder
1/2 ts Garlic Powder
1/4 ts Lemon Grass Powder
1 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Chilli Powder
1/2 ts Turmeric
1 ts Coconut Powder
* peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes

Add enough water to the spices to make a stiffish paste, then leave to
stand for a few minutes.

Make a puree of the onion, garlic, chillies, red pepper and ginger.

Heat the oil and fry the spice paste for 5 minutes or so; stir to
prevent sticking. Then add the puree and fry for 15 minutes. WARNING:
The puree will sputter and splash quite a lot during this stage! Just
grit your teeth and keep going!

Combine the cubed yam and sweet potato with the above in a casserole
and place in an oven preheated to 375F/190C. Cook for about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, heat the milk and melt the block of creamed coconut.

Brown the dessicated coconut under the grill.

Halfway through the cooking of the casserole, add the two coconuts
and the tamarind puree to the dish. Stir, and add some water (or
vegetable stock) if it needs it ~ the finished curry should have a
thick, rich sauce.

Serves 4.

NOTES:

This is the curry I made for a dinner party on Good Friday. I used
yams and sweet potatoes, but in the past I've used a mixture of
broccolli and cauliflower with equally good results. Before becoming
vegetarian, I used to use cubed lean lamb or beef. Whichever main
ingredient is used, it's long been my favourite home-made curry!
