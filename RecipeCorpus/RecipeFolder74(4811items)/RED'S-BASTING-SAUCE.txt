Melt the butter, add the onions and garlic, and saute for 4 to 5
minutes to soften. Add the beer, squeeze in the lemon juice, and add
the lemon rinds to the pot. When the foam subsides, add all of the

medium low and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep baste warm, adding beer

quickly, giving the meat a nasty taste.
