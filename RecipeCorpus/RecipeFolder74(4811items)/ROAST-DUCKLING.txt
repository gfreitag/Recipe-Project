1. Wash and dry ducklings.  Pierce skin all over with fork so fat
will cook out. (Set giblets aside to simmer for broth) 2. Rub skin
with mixture of salt and pepper: stuff 4 onion quarters into cavity
of each bird; place on a rack in a large roasting pan. (Or use two
small pans, if necessary) 3. Roast, uncovered in a slow over 325F 3
hours, or until drumstick joints move easily and ducklings are a rich
golden-brown. (During roasting, pierce skin with fork several times.
Also to keep fat from smoking, dip it from the roasting pan into a
bowl several times during cooking. There will be as much as 6
cupfuls.) 4.  Cut 2 ducklings into quarters. (Poultry sheers do a
fast job.) Arrange on a heated serving platter. Serve with Golden
Gravy and Pumpernickel Stuffing ( Set other duckling aside to cool.)
5. Wrap cooled duckling; chill with 4 cups of Duck Giblet Broth or
Duck Pilaf for another meal. DUCK GIBLET BROTH Combine giblets
(except liver) and necks with 1 medium-size onion, chopped; handful
of celery tops; 2 teaspooons of salt; and 6  cups water in a large
saucepan. Simmer one hour. Add livers for last 20 minutes cooking.
Strain stock; measure; add water, if needed to make 6 cups.  Save 4
cups for making Duck Pilaf, Grind or chop giblets and add to
remaining 2 cups broth for Golden Gravy. Makes 6 cups. GOLDEN GRAVY
Remove rack from roasting pan.  Tip pan and our off all fat into a
bowl. Return 4 tablespoons to pan; blend with 4 tablespoons flour;
cook stirring all the time, just until mixture bubbles.  Stir in 2
cups of broth with ground giblets; continue cooking and stirring,
scraping baked-on juices from bottom and sides of pan, until gray
thickens and boils 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
