Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Dried red kidney beans
2 c  Chopped yellow onions
1 bn Of scallions, chopped
3    Or 4 finely sliced cloves
-of garlic
1 bn Parsley (chopped)
3 lb Smoked sausage *

I just made no-fat refried beans last night completely by accident.

I was making this recipe and discovered it in the process.

Soak beans overnight if possible.  Drain water and add beans to a
large 8- or 10-quart pot.  Then add enough of the cold water to cover
the beans. Add chopped yellow onions and garlic and bring to a boil.
Cook for one hour and add all the other things and more water if
necessary.

Simmer (slight bubbling action) for 2 more hours or until the beans
are soft.  Then remove 2 cups of cooked beans without juice and mash
very good. Then return the mashed up beans to the pot and stir into
the mixture. This makes a creamy, thicker gravy.  If the beans are
too dry, add enough water to make them like you like them. Good over
boiled rice.

Serves 8.

If you're in New Orleans on a Monday, this is the only thing you can
eat.

When I got to the point where you take the two cups beans out and
mash 'em, I put them in the food processor to puree. They came out
smelling and tasting just like refried beans.  The texture was a tad
thin, but that could be remedied easily.  You could probably even
"re- fry" them in a non-stick skillet to reduce the water content. I
used skin-on ham hocks to make this batch of beans, but you could
easily leave that out and still come up with something close to what
you want, I think.
