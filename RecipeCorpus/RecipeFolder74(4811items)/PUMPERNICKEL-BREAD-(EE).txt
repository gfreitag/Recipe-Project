Recipe by: ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW#EE2150

In bowl of an electric mixer combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, yeast,
coffee, and caraway and fennel seeds. In a saucepan combine molasses,
butter, chocolate, vinegar, sugar, salt and 1 1/4 cups of water and
heat, stirring, until warm but not boiling. With motor on low, pour
it into flour mixture, and mix for 30 seconds. Increase speed to
highh and mix 3 minutes more.

Using a spoon add rye flour and as much of remaining flour as
possible. Dough will be slightly sticky. Turn dough out onto a
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Shape into a
ball, place in a greased bowl, cover and let double in size. Punch
dough down, turn it out onto a floured surface and divide it into two
pieces. Shape into rounds, place them on a baking sheet (leaving them
enough room to double). Cover and let rise.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Whisk egg white and 1 tablespoon water.
Brush tops of rounds with egg white glaze and bake for 35 to 40
minutes, until brown and hollow-sounding when bottoms are tapped.
