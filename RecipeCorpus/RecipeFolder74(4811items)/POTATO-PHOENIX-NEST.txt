Title: POTATO PHOENIX NEST
Categories: Potatoes, Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Medium-sized white new
-potatoes, shredded
1 tb Cornstarch
Oil for frying
A basket of golden potato shreds, called a Phoenix nest, makes a
handsome presentation for almost any stir fried dish. After you eat
the contents, you break the next apart with fingers and nibble. You
can make one large next for a single entree or several small ones for
individual servings. Because the nests are an open mesh, plan to fill
them with a stir fried dish that has a light glaze rather than a
heavy gravy. To make a Phoenix nest you need 2 sieves of the same
size, one to act as a form and one to hold the shreds in place as
they cook. To hold the cooking oil, use a deep pan or wok in which
the sieves will fit comfortably. To determine how much oil to use,
place an empty sieve in the pan, then pour in enough oil to cover at
least 3/4 of the sieve. Nests are made of potato, sweet potato or
taro root.  If made ahead, stack nests, separated by paper towels,
and seal in a plastic bag. They can be stored at room temperature for
up to 2 days.

Squeeze potato, by the handful, to eliminate liquid, then place in a
bowl. Sprinkle cornstarch over potato and toss to distribute
cornstarch evenly and loosen shreds. Arrange a handful of shreds
inside one sieve in a latticework over the bottom and at least
halfway up the side. Fit second sieve inside first.  Heat oil to 325
degrees on a deep-frying thermometer, place sieve in pan, and cook
nest until golden brown (about 3 or 4 minutes). Remove from oil and
lift of top sieve. Loosen edge of nest with tip of a sharp knife,
then gently remove nest and drain on paper towels. Makes 4 to 5 four
inch nests.
