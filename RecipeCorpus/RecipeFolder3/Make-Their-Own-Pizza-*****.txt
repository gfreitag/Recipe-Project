advance of the party, roll out the biscuits or rolls very flat between
sheets of waxed paper and store on a cookie sheet in refrigerator.
When it's time to bake, set the oven at the temp on dough pkg (usually
350-425 deg F) and pour the sauce into a bowl that can be reached by
all. Set out the cheese and other toppings (anything you think the
kids will like, or nothing if you think plain cheese is enough), give
each child 2 pizzas on a paper plate, arm them with spoons, and let
them make their own. You collect the pies, put them on baking sheets,
and try to remember whose is whose.
Note: You can use English muffins instead of dough. Allow 1 muffin per
child as the base for the pizza.
