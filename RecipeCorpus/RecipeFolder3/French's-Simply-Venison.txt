Title: French's Simply Venison
Categories: Meats, French
Yield: 4 servings
Coarsley grnd black pepper
Squeezable soft margarine
Deer ham parts
Adolph's Meat Tenderizer
The secret to good venison is always to muscle the meat. Muscling means to
remove each muscle individually. Once finished, the cook will have several
cylindrical pieces resembling tenderloin. Place pieces in a Pyrex dish,
sprinkle each side with meat tenderizer and coarsley ground black pepper.
Puncture each side liberally with a sharp fork. Squeeze margarine on one
side. Turn meat over and repeat process on other side. Broil on high heat
for about 4 minutes. Turn meat over and broil until brown. Remember venison
is not as good when it is overcooked.
