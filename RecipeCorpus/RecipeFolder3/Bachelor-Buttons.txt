1 pn Salt
1 pn Nutmeg
Sugar for sprinkling
1/4 c  Butter, cold
1 1/3 c  Flour, all-purpose
1    Egg
5 oz Sugar
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, Rub the butter into the
flour.  In a small bowl, beat the egg with half of the sugar, add the egg
mixture and the remaining sugar to the butter and flour mixture.  Add the
salt and nutmeg and mix well.  Roll the dough between the palms of your

them for rolling the dough.  Sprinkle dough pieces lightly with sugar and
place 2-3 inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with buttered craft paper.

8 minutes.  (The tops should be done but not browned.)  Remove from oven;
transfer to wire rack.  Cool completely, then store in airtight container.
