Flour
1 c  Lukewarm water
1/2    To 1 cake dry yeast
Crumble yeast in water.  Allow to stand 20 minutes.  Add flour to make a
stiff drop batter.  Beat until smooth.  Cover and let stand in warm place
overnight until light and bubbly.  The greater amount of yeast makes the
sponge work more rapidly. The Household Searchlight - 1941
