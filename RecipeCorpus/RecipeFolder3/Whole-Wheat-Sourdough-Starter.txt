Title: Whole-Wheat Sourdough Starter
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Active dry yeast
1 1/2 x  Lukewarm water
NFXS18B
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
In a glass or ceramic bowl or jar that has been scalded, combine flour and
yeast, add water and blend well. Cover with plastic wrap and pierce with
fork to release gases. Place in a warm, draft-free location at an even 85F
for 18-24 hrs; stir several times daily. Refrigerate until ready to use. If
you have several starters, keep whole wheat separate from others to
preserve its own distinctive flavor. Whole wheat starter does not have as
much rising action as that made with white flour; you may have to plan
longer rising times. To replenish, always use whole wheat flour.
