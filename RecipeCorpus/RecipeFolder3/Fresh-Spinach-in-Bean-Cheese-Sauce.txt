1/2 ts Sugar
2    Cubes fermented bean curd
With chili (bean cheese)
Cornstarch paste
2    Bunches fresh spinach
2 tb Peanut oil

smoke, add 1/2 spinach, and toss until it begins to wilt. Push wilted
spinach up side of wok; add remaining spinach, and toss until it wilts.
Push all spinach out of bottom of wok; add chili and ginger; stir for about
10 seconds. Add liquid ingredients; stir; when liquids boils, thicken to
medium consistency with dribbles of cornstarch paste.  Recombine with
spinach.  Stir to coat spinach.  Serve.  Spinach should remain bright green
until you pour in liquid.
