"Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more
vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with
small dumplings. This soup is very good reheated.. The most authentic
version of Quebec's soupe aux pois use whole yellow peas, with salt pork
and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is usually chopped and
returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice thinly and served
sepaprately. Instead of fresh or dried herbs, herbes salees (herbs
preserved with salt) are often used; they are available commercially or
made at home.
Pea soup remains a popular dish in resturants where tourists enjoy a true
taste of old Quebec. In some variations, a little garlic, leeks, other
vegetables or a ham bone are added for flavour. For a thicker consaistency
(though this is not traditional) a cup or two of cooked peas can be pureed
then returned to the soup."

Wash and sort peas; soak in cold water ovvernight. Drain and place in a
large pot; add water, parsley, salt pork, onion, celery, carrots, parsley,
bay leaf, savory and 1 tsp salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer
until peas are very tender, about 2 hours, adding more water if needed.
Remove salt pork; chop and return to soup. Discard bay leaf. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. MAKES 8 SERVING: SOURCE: "The First Decade"
