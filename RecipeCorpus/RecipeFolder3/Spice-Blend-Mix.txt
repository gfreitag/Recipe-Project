2 tb Ground Cinnamon
1 tb Ground Nutmeg
1 1/2 ts Ground Cloves
*I use lemon peel instead of Orange peel In a 1/2 cup conatainer with a
tight-fitting lid, combine all ingredients. Attach lid. Label with date and
contents. Store in a cool dry place. Use within 6 months. Makes about 6
tablespoons SPICE BLEND MIX. NOTE: Add one teaspoon or more to cake
batters, quick bread batters, whipped cream and pancakes. I use this for
anything that calls for and of the ingredients used. It adds variety. From
