Title: Bakaliaro Tiganito ( Fried Salt-Cod )
Categories: Ethnic, Fish/sea
Yield: 6 servings
1 pn Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
Vegetable oil for frying
1 1/2 lb Dried salt cod
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2/3 c  Cold water
Cut the cod into 4-inch sections.  Place in a glass or earthenware bowl,
cover with cold water, and soak overnight.  The next day, drain and discard
the water.  Put the cod in a pot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a
boil, then remove from the heat and lift out the cod with a slotted spoon.
Remove the bones and the black skin.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, water, salt, and baking powder to make
a thin batter.  Dip the cod in batter and fry in hot oil (about 1/2 inch
deep) on both sides, then lower heat and cook until tender, turning once
again.  Serve hot, with skordalia, which is cold or room temperature.

Note: If the cod is excessively salty, change water 2 or 3 times during the
soaking period.
