In a large soup kettle, cook the ground round, sausage, onions, red and
green pepeprs, chili peppers, and garlic over medium-high heat, stirring
often, until the meat is seared (but not browned), about 10 minutes. Pour
off excess fat. Add the chili powder, salt, oregano, cumin, and bay leaves
and stir for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes with their puree, breaking up the
tomatoes with a spoon. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook,
stirring often, until the liquid is reduced, about 1-1/2 hours. In a small
bowl, combine the cornmeal and 1/2 cup of water. Stir the cornmeal mixture
and the pink and black beans into the chili.Cook, stirring occasionally,
until the chili is thickened, about 10 minutes. (The chli can be made up to
3 days ahead. If desired, scrape off and discard the solidified fat that
rises to the surface. Reheat the chili gently on top of the stove before
serving.) Makes about 25 servings. Source: "An Edible Christmas" (A
