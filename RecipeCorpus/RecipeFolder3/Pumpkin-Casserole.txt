Pumpkin dishes don't have to be sweet. This one is perfect with roast pork.
Hollow out a small pumpkin to serve this in for a special presentation.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Using a paring knife or vegetable peeler, peel and
discard outer skin of the pumpkin. Slice the pumpkin into 1/4-inch slices
and place in a mixing bowl. Add the onion, salt, pepper and butter and toss
well. Pour contents of the bowl into a 9-inch round or square greased
baking dish, cover with foil and place in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat eggs, milk and cheese together until smooth. Remove the
baking dish from the oven, remove the cover and pour the cheese mixture
over the top. Replace in oven, uncovered, another 20 minutes. The gratin is
done when it turns golden brown.
