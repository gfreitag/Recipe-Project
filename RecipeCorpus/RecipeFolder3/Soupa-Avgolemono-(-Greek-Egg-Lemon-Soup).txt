Title: Soupa Avgolemono ( Greek Egg-Lemon Soup)
Categories: Soups/stews, Greek
Yield: 6 servings
2    Lemons; (juice only)
-Salt
2 qt Chicken broth; strained
1/2 c  Raw long grain white rice
2    Whole eggs or egg yolks
Bring the broth to a full boil in a soup kettle.  Gradually add the rice,
stirring constantly until the broth boils again.  Reduce the heat, cover,
and simmer until the rice is just tender, not mushy, 12 to 14 minutes.
Remove from the heat and keep warm while preparing avgolemono. Beat the
eggs for 2 minutes.  Continue to beat, gradually add the lemon juice.
Slowly add some of the hot broth to the egg-lemon mixture, beating
steadily.  Stir the mixture into the soup and cook over minimum heat,
without boiling, until the soup thickens to coat a spoon.  Taste for salt,
and keep warm over hot water until ready to serve.  Pass the pepper mill at
the table for additional zest.
(If desired, bite-sized pieces of cooked chicken may be added to soup
before adding the rice).
