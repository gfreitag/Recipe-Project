Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Shortening
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 c  -boiling water
2 c  Oatmeal
1 c  Flour
1 c  Brown sugar
1 ts -Salt
Combine dry ingredients and cut in shortening. Disolve baking soda in the
boiling water and add, continuing to mix with a knife. Mold with the hands
and shape into a long wedge. Slice off and bake in a 400F oven for 10
minutes. This recipe comes from the county where the Scots first landed in
Canada (and where my dad was born.) To quote the author, "Our Scottish
ancestors used "real" oatmeal when they made their favorite oatcakes.
However sugar did creep in, as indicated bt this 75 year old recipe. (The
book was published in 1971 so the recipe would be form the year 1894.)
