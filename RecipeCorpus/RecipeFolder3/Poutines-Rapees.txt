"For many Acadians living in southeastern New Brunswick, Poultine Rapee,
potato dumpling dish with a mixture of seasoned pork in the centre, is
considered a national dish. In other parts of Acadia, these delicacies are
prepared without the meat and fish is sometimes added to fricot. Although
the greyish colour and gluey texture of the poutines makes them appear
somewhat unappetizing, their taste more than compensates for their
unattractive appearance."

Soak the pork overnight in cold water to remove the salt, and cut into
cubes. Extract the water from the grated potatoes by putting them in a
cotton bag and squeezing vigourously. Mix the mashed potatoes with grated
potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the potato mixture into balls
resembling small snowballs. Make a hole in the centre of the potato ball
and add 1 Tbsp of the salt pork. Close the hole and roll the poultines in
flour. Gently drop the poultines 2 or 3 at a time, into a large pot of
boiling salted water, ensuring that the water is kept at a rolling boil.
Simmer the poultines for 2-3 hours. Eat the poultines hot with butter, salt
and pepper, or as a dessert with sugar and molasses. MAKES: 6 POULTINES
