Title: Pommes Caramel (Caramel Apples)
Categories: Desserts, Canadian
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Vanilla
6    Apples
1/3 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar; Brown pref.
Melt butter in frypan and add sugar. Stir till sugar is dissolved or
softened and everything is well blended, then add vanilla. Core unpeeled
apples, cut them into quarters and add to hot sugar. Simmer uncovered over
medium heat, basting often with the syrup for 15-20 minutes.

To quote the author, "Make these with the first fresh apples. In Quebec we
use the first ripe Melbas. Served hot or cold, they are superb on ice
cream." Source: _Canadiana Cookbook_ by Mme. Jehane Benoit
