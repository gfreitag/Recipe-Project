1 ts Sugar
-NFXS18B
Lg baking potato peeled,cube
1 c  White flour
Cook potato in water to cover until tender. Pour off liquid to measure 1 c,
saving potato for other use. Let potato water cook to lukewarm. In a glass
or ceramic bowl that has been scalded, place flour, yeast and sugar; add
lukewarm potato water and stir in well. Cover with plastic wrap and pierce
with fork to release gases. Place in a warm, draft-free location at an even
85F for 2 days; stir several times daily. (do not let sourdough starter
rise above 95F because higher temp are favorable to less desireable
microorganisms) Refrigerate until ready to use. Replenish with one c flour
and 3/4 c water and let stand overnight or 12 hrs in a warm location before
refrigerating again. When replenishing, add lukewarm water with flour.
Starter should be at room temp when using in recipes, always after having
stood 12 hrs from addition of replenishing flour and water. At least 1 c
should remain to refrigerate.
