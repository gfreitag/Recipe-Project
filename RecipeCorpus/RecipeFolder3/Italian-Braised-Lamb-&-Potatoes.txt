Title: Italian Braised Lamb & Potatoes
Categories: Italian, Casseroles, Beef, Lamb
Yield: 6 servings
3    Garlic cloves crushed
1    Capsicum red, cut into strip
250 ml Lamb or beef stock
500 g  Potatoes, peeled & cut into
- 4cm pieces
60 g  Pecorino, grated
5 tb Olive oil
1 kg Lamb, lean boneless from the
- shoulder cut into 4cm pcs
2    Brown onions
1/2 bn Italian parsley, leaves only
-chopped
The potatoes should be yellow, waxy ones, such as Petrones or Desirees.

Heat half the oil in a large heavy pot.  Brown lamb well in batches and,
using a slotted spoon, remove to a plate.   Add remaining oil.   Add onion
and cook until softened.   Add parsley, garlic and capsicum.   Return lamb
to pot, stir and add stock and freshly ground pepper to taste.   (Don't add
salt yet as pecorino is a salty cheese)    Reduce heat, cover, and simmer
for 30 minutes.

Add potato and simmer for another 20 minutes, or until lamb is almost
tender.   Stir in cheese and cook for 10 minutes. Season with freshly
ground pepper and salt to taste.

Best if cooked 1 - 2 days ahead and refrigerated.   Like all casseroles, it
will improve in flavour during the resting period.   Great for
entertaining, because it can be cooked well in advance, leaving you free to
get on with the many chores involved in throwing a party.
