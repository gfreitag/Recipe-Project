1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3/4 c  Coca-Cola
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
2 1/4 c  Raw carrots, grated
1 c  Nuts, chopped
1 c  Coconut, flaked

Mix all the dry ingredients together. Beat the eggs well; add sugar, oil,
3/4 cup cola, and vanilla and beat well. Stir in the dry ingredients until
smooth, then add the carrots, nuts and coconut. Mix well. Bake in a greased
and lightly floured 13 x 9 pan in a preheated 350~F oven for 40-50 minutes,
until cake tests done. Remove from oven and prick hot cake all over with a
fork, then pour the cola syrup slowly, evenly over the top. Serve warm or
room temperature with lightly sweetened-vanilla flavored whipped cream.
Coca-Cola Syrup: Combine sugar, cocoa, cola, butter and corn syrup in
saucepan; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil,
stirring, until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla extract.
Remove from heat and pour, hot, over hot cake.
