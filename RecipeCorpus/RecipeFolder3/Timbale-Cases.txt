Title: Timbale Cases
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Flour
1    Egg
1/2 ts Cooking oil
Combine slightly beaten egg, milk, sugar, salt, and cooking oil. Sift flour
slowly into the mixture, beating constantly until smooth. Set aside for 1
hour or until free from bubbles.  Fry on a timbale-iron which has been
heated by immersing in deep, hot fat (360ø F). Dip heated iron into batter.
Hold iron at an angle until the bottom is covered, then lower iron into
batter until 1/2 inch from top. Hold iron straight and lower into hot fat
(360ø F).  Cook until case is crisp and brown.  Remove from fat; slip case
from iron.  Drain on crumpled, absorbent paper. If batter slips from iron
back into bowl the iron is not hot enough. If case slips from iron into
fat, the fat is too hot. The Household Searchlight - 1941
