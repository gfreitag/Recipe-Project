Title: Jewish "Corn" Bread (2 of 2)
Categories: Breads, Jewish
Yield: 2 servings  7.  While the loaves are rising, set a large roasting pan containing 2
inches of boiling water on the oven floor (or the lowest shelf of an
electric oven) and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 8. Brush the loaves
with egg-white glaze, being careful not to let the glaze drip onto the pan,
as it sticks and burns.  With a single-edged razor blade or a small, sharp
knife, cut three diagonal slashes, holding the blade almost parallel to the
surface, about 1/4 inch deep on each loaf. Sprinkle the loaves with "black
caraway" or caraway seeds, if you like. 9. Bake for 30 minutes on the
middle and upper shelves of the oven, then brush again with glaze, exchange
shelf positions, and remove the water pan. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes
longer, or until there is a hollow sound when you rap the bottom of the
loaf. 10. Cool the bread on racks.

There is no historical or etymological theory for the term, "corn" in this
bread.
