Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
Yield: 12 servings
2 ts Baking powder
3    Large eggs
1 c  Sour cream
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
4 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
-coarsely chopped
-Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter;
-softened
3/4 c  Sugar
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 10-to 12-cup fluted tube
pan. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed,
beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and continue
beating at high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Sift
together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. At low speed,
beat in 1/2 cup of the flour mixture, then beat in 1 of the eggs. Beat in
another 1/2 cup of the flour mixture, then 1 of the remaining eggs. Repeat
with another 1/2 cup of the flour mixture, and the last egg. Beat in the
remaining flour along with the sour cream and vanilla. Using a spatula,
fold in the walnuts and chocolate. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan
and smooth the surface. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes in the preheated oven
until the cake begins to shrink from the sides of the pan and a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean. The surface will crack. Remove the
cake from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes in the pan, then turn
it out onto a wire cake rack. Cool completely before serving. Serves 12.
