Title: Raisin Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 servings
1    Cake compressed yeast
6 c  Flour
3/4 c  Raisins
2 c  Milk, scalded
2 tb Melted shortening
1/4 c  Molasses
1 1/2 ts Salt
Combine milk, salt, shortening, and molasses.  Cool until lukewarm. Add
yeast to cooled milk.  Allow to stand 5 minutes. Add raisins. Add flour, a
little at a time, beating well after each addition, until dough is just
stiff enough to knead on a lightly floured board. Knead until smooth and
elastic.  Cover with a warm, damp cloth, and allow to double in bulk. Knead
down, allow to double in bulk again.  Form into loaves.  Place in
well-oiled pans.  Cover and let rise until double in bulk.  Bake in hot
oven (425Ã¸ F) about 45 minutes. Mrs. I.M., Denver, CO.
