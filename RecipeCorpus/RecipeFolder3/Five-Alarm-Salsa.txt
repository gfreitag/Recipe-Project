In a medium saucepan, bring all the ingredients to a simmer over medium-low
heat, then cook for 5 minutes. Spoon the salsa into hot, sterilized jars
and attach the lids. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 5
minutes. Remove from the water and cool at room temperature. Note: The
canned chili peppers will make a milder salsa than if you use fresh chiles.
After opening, you can extend the salsa (and mute the heat a little) by
stirring in a cupful of minced bell peppers or thawed corn kernels. A
tablespoon or so of chopped coriander leaves adds a nice fillip. Makes
about 2 pints. Source: "An Edible Christmas"(A Treasury of Recipes of the
