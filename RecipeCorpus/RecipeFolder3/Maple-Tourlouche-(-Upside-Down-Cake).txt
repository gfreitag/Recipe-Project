Bring syrup to a boil and pour into a generously buttered 8 by 8 by2 baking
dish.  Let stand in a warm place, With a large spoon beat butter, sugar and
egg together until creamy. Mix remaining dry ingredietns and add with the
milk to the creamed mixture, stirring until well blended. Place as four
large balls into hot syrup, then stretch dough with two forks until all are
joined together.  This is easy because the dough gets soft when it comes in

cream, served warm. From a recipe by Mme. Jehane Benoit. in _The Canadiana
