each.

Dissolve the soda in a cup with the buttermilk.  In a separate bowl combine
the flour with the spices and add to the creamed mixture alternately with
the buttermilk. Stir in the pecans and raisins. Store the batter in an
airtight container in the refrigerator. When ready to bake fill greased
muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes or

This is one of my favorite muffin recipes -- even the kids love them!!
