It is recommended that you rub in flavorings just before putting the fish
into the smoker, although you can also put flavorings into either of the
above brines; in other words you can prepare a brine marinade flavored with
garlic, shallots, tarragon, dill, thyme, or whatever you fancy. After
brining in the flavored brine, fish should washed off and dried before
smoking.

Smoked fish will keep for a solid year, at least if they are frozen in
airtight plastic bags from which the air has been exhaled.
