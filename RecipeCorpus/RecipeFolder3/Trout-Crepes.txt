2/3 c  Sauterne

In cooking the crepes, before filling and rolling up with the trout
mixture, a 6-inch skillet is handy.  Makes 20 crepes. NOTE: To make crepes,
mix the ingredients for the batter together thoroughly and let rest for at
least 1 hour. Brush skillet with a little butter, heat until almost
smoking, and pour enough batter to thinly cover bottom of pan after it is
tipped to spread evenly to edges. Cook over medium heat, turning when
bubbles appear on surface; cook other side until lightly browned. Repeat,
making 20 crepes in all, set aside.

Cook and stir onion and garlic in butter until onion is tender. Remove from
heat.  Blend in flour, salt, and pepper.  Cook over low heat, stirring,
until mixture is bubbly.  Remove from heat. Stir in milk and wine. Heat to
boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute. Stir in trout pieces.
Fill each crepe with 2 tablespoons filling. Heat crepes at 350 degree oven
for 10 minutes. Serve crepes topped with remaining filling.
