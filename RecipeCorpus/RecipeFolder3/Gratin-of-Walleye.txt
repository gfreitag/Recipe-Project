Title: Gratin of Walleye
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
5 tb Cooking oil
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
2    Cloves garlic, chopped fine
1/2 ts Powdered thyme
2 lb Walleye fillets
2 tb Parsley, minced
Salt and pepper
2 tb Capers (W/juice)
2    Green peppers
Roasted peppers lend a wonderful flavor to fish dishes.  Prepare this dish
in a shallow baking dish or baked in individual gratin dishes if available.
Wash and pat the fillets dry, then dice into 1-inch squares. Season with
salt and pepper.
Wash, then dry the green peppers and roast them under the broiler,
turning them as the skin blackens.  Place the peppers in a paper bag, seal
by twisting the top, and set aside for 5 minutes or so. Then remove and,
with finger, push and pinch off most of the blackened skin. Cut in half,
remove the seeds and stems and slice into thin strips.
Put the oil in a big skillet and saute the garlic until it is
translucent.  Then scrape in the fillet squares from your cutting board,
turn up the heat, and cook, stirring constantly for about 5 minutes.
Off heat, add and mix thoroughly the peppers, parsley, capers, and half
the bread crumbs into which you have mixed the thyme. Spoon into baking
dish and sprinkle the rest of the crumb-thyme mixture over all, and place
under the broiler for a minute or two to brown. Serve with tossed salad and
baked potatoes.
