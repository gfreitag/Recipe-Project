To quote Mme. Benoit,"This traditional Quebec dish is still very much
alive.  My grandmother's recipe is, as far as I am concerned, the best
there is." Note: from Anne - it seems as oysters were used at Christmas. My
maternal grandmother from the American midwest had a similar Christmas
oyster dish although hers included corn.
