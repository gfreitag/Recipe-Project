"Skidaddle Ridge, New Brunswick, cam by itd name because it was a hideout
for draft dodgers. The "Skidaddlers were Democrats who, not in sympathy
with the Republican Party during the Civil War; "skidaddled" out of the
country. Most of them returned home after the war, but many stayed to
settle in New Brunswick and Southern Ontario.

These cookies are frequently packed in the lunch boxes carried by hunters
in this region."

inches about on a greased baking sheet. Bake in 350 oven for 10 to 12
minutes, or until golden brown. MAKES: about 6 dozen Source:_The Laura
