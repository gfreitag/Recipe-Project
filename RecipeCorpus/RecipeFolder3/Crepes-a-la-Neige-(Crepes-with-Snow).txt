"Throughout Acadia, it was customary to make crepes at Candlemas and
objects such as medals, wedding rings, buttons or pennies were hidden
inside and often used to predict the future of those who found them.
Moreover, since eggs were often scarce this time of year as a substitute
with spectacular results. Hence some Acadians still describe a snowfall as
"being enough to make crepes with." This recipe is always called Crepes a
la neige, even when eggs are used instead of snow."

Mix all the ingredients together to make a smooth dough. Drop a spoonful of
the batter into 1 inch of hot fat. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side. Serve
with molasses or grated maple sugar.
