Prepare the pasta.  Place dry ingredients and butter in food processor
fitted with a pastry blade and run machine for 1 minute, or until butter is
cut up and mixture feels sandy.  Add eggs and run machine in quick spurts
for 2 minutes, or until dough forms a compact ball. 2. Cut dough into 4-5
small pieces.  Lightly flour each and roll it through pasta machine (set
rollers at widest gap). When dough is smooth, reduce gap between rollers
and roll the dough again. Continue in this fashion until rollers are at
their narrowest setting.  As dough sheets come out, dust them lightly with
flour and spread them out on the table. 3. Prepare filling. Steam spinach
for 30 seconds or until tender, rinse it under cold water, and squeeze it
tightly to extract all the water. Place the spinach and remaining
ingredients for filling in food processor and grind until smooth. (See part
