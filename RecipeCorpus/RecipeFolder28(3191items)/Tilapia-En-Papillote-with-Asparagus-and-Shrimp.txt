1/2 lb Thin or medium asparagus
2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
Grated zest of 1 lemon
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper, to taste
Snap off the thick ends of the asparagus, cut the spears diagonally
into bite-size pieces, and blanch in lightly salted water.

Drain and cool.

Meanwhile, beat the butter until light and blend in the lemon zest;
season to taste with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

For each portion, fold a 12-inch square of baking parchment in half
diagonally and crease the corners.

Arrange one portion of tilapia filet on one side of the paper.

Season with a little lemon juice and top with a quarter of the shrimp
and asparagus.

Dot with a quarter of the lemon butter.

Fold the other side of the paper over the fish and seal the package
into a half oval with a series of creases, starting with one corner
and finishing with a twist at the opposite end.

Repeat for the remaining portions.

Bake the packages on a sheet pan until the paper is browned and
puffy, 7 to 8 minutes.

To serve, slit open each package and slide the contents, out onto a
plate; or serve in the paper, letting each diner cut open his own.
