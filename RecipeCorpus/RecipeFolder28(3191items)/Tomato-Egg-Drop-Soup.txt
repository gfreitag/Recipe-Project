Egg Drop Soup is traditionally Chinese. Tomatoes are not. They were
introduced less than 100 years ago, but nevertheless, they work
wonderfully in this soup.

PUT THE CHICKEN STOCK into a pot and bring to a simmer. If using fresh
tomatoes, peel, seed and cut into 1-inch cubes. If using canned
tomatoes, chop them into small chunks. Lightly beat the eggs, then
combine them with sesame oil in a small bowl. Add the light soy sauce
and salt to the simmering stock, and stir to mix them in well. Add
the tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes. Next, stir in the scallions,
and then add the egg mixture in a very slow, thin stream. Using a
chopstick or fork, pull the egg slowly into strands. (Stirring the
egg in a "figure 8" works well.) Garnish with the finely chopped
scallion tops.
