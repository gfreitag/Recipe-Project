Categories: Appetizers, Low-cal/fat, Vegetarian
Yield: 10 servings
1 tb Olive oil
1 ts Sherry wine vinegar
-OR- red wine vinegar
Cayenne pepper
Crudites
Toasted pita wedges
2    Yellow bell peppers
-- halved
2    Red bell peppers; halved
8 lg Whole garlic cloves
-- unpeeled
12    Almonds
Preheat broiler.  Line heavy large baking sheet with foil.  Arrange
peppers cut side down in center of baking sheet; surround with
garlic. Broil 6 inches from heat until peppers are blackened and
garlic is tender, turning garlic often, about 12 minutes.  Gather
foil up around peppers and garlic; let stand until cool enough to
handle, about 10 minutes. Working over bowl to catch any juices, peel
and seed peppers; reserve juices. Keeping red and yellow peppers
separate, cut into pieces; transfer to 2 separate bowls. Peel and
chop garlic, discarding any hard pieces.

Finely chop 6 almonds in processor.  Add yellow peppers, half of
garlic, 1 teaspoon reserved pepper juice, 1/2 tablespoon oil, 1/2
teaspoon vinegar and pinch of cayenne and puree.  Season with salt
and pepper. Transfer to small bowl.

Using clean processor, repeat with remaining 6 almonds, red peppers,
remaining garlic, 1 teaspoon pepper juice, 1/2 tablespoon olive oil,
1/2 teaspoon vinegar and pinch of cayenne.  Season with salt and
pepper. (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and chill purees
separately. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

Simultaneously spoon each puree into shallow bowl.  Shake bowl gently,
allowing purees to meet in center.  Serve with crudites and pita
wedges.

Makes about 1-1/4 cup.
