1. Prepare Pumpkin Shortcakes: Heat oven to 375'F. In large bowl,
combine flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt.
With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs.

2. In small bowl, combine pumpkin puree, heavy cream, and gingerroot.
Stir into flour mixture until just combined-do not overmix.

3. Grease 2 baking sheets. Drop shortcake batter, 1/4 cupful at a
time, onto greased baking sheets. Pinch tops of shortcakes to create
small mounds. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until shortcakes brown
slightly and centers spring back when lightly pressed with fingertip.

4. Meanwhile, prepare Fall-Fruit Filling: In large skillet, melt
butter. Add brown sugar, cinnamon, orange rind, gingerroot, and
cloves. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is
well blended and bubbly.

5. Add apple juice and prunes to sugar mixture; cook 2 minutes. Add
apple and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in
cranberries; cook until cranberries soften but do not burst, and the
juice becomes syrupy. Remove from heat and stir in walnuts. Set aside
to cool.

6. Just before serving, in small bowl, with electric mixer, combine
heavy cream and confectioners' sugar; beat un- til soft peaks form.
Cut off tops of shortcakes and set aside. On serving plate, place a
heaping tablespoon of Fall-Fruit Filling and whipped cream on each
shortcake bottom. Replace tops and serve immediately.
