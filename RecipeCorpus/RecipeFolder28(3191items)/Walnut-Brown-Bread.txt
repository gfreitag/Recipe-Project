Title: Walnut Brown Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 10 servings
4 ts Baking soda
2 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs; slightly beaten
1 c  Walnuts; chopped
3 c  Raisins
3 c  Water
1/4 c  Shortening
5 1/2 c  Unbleached flour; sifted
2 c  Sugar
Combine the raisins and water in a 3-quart saucepan and bring to a
boil.
Boil, uncovered, for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and add the
shortening.  Cool to lukewarm.  Sift the flour, sugar, baking soda
and salt
together into a mixing bowl and add the eggs, walnuts and raisin
mixture.
Stir until just moistened.  Spoon the batter into 6 greased (1-lb)
vegetable cans.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 1 hour or
until
a cake tester or wooden pick inserted in the center of each loaf
comes out   clean.  Cover with aluminum foil for the last 15 minutes
of baking to
prevent overbrowning.  Cool in the cans for 10 minutes before
turning out
onto wire racks to cool to room temperature.
