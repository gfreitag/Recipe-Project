This all can be done on one day, but the directions show a two day
schedule of preparationa.  The pie should be assembled and baked the
same day. It does not turn out as well if you assemble it,
refrigerate the whole pie, and then bake it the next day.

DAY BEFORE Vegetables: Cut Red and yellow peppers into 1 inch pieces.
Chop onion.  In 12 inch skillet over medium heat, in hot olive oil,
cook onion until tender crisp; add red and yellow peppers, basil,
black pepper and salt.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables
are tender. Remove, and refrigerate until next day.

DAY BEFORE OR THE SAME DAY IF YOU WISH Cheese: In cup, beat egg
slightly. Reserve 1 tablespoon beaten egg (for crust- later) Set
aside, cover in fridge for next day.

In medium bowl, mix remaining egg with ricotta cheese, well drained
spinach and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

PASTA:  Prepare day of baking.

Prepare pasta as label directs, but do not use salt in the water;
drain.

SAUCE: Have ready, and measured out.

ASSEMBLY:

Have home made crust ready for rolling, or take frozen crust out and
let defrost for time on package. (Remember - deep dish size)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Grease 9" x 2 1/2" SPRINGFORM PAN.  On
lightly floured surface, with floured rolling pin, roll 2/3 of the
dough to 15 inch round. For frozen dough, one crust should roll to
needed size. Gently ease crust into springform pan, allowing dough to
hang over side of pan slightly.

Sprinkle bottom crust with half of the mozzarella cheese; top with
half of sauteed pepper mixture, spread half of ricotta cheese mixture
over pepper mixture; top with the pasta, then the marinara sauce.
Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over sauce, top with remaining
sauteed pepper mixture, then remaining ricotta cheese mixture.

Roll remaining crust to 11 inches round;  lay dough over filling,
allowing dough to hang over side of pan.  Fold overhang in toward
center, pinching dough all around to make a stand up edge; flute. Cut
slits in top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.  Brush top
and edge with reserved tablespoon of egg.

Bake pie 55 to 60 minutes until crust is golden and filling is hot.

Allow pie to cool 5 minutes for easier slicing.  Remove side of
springform pan.

To serve, cut into wedges.   Makes 8 servings.

As listed is vegetarian.  To add meat, 1/2 pound ground beef or mild
italian sausage, browned and drained my be added to the marinana
sauce, then proceed as above.

I have not made this, but have eaten this dish.  It is a show stopper
on presentation and taste.

A nice touch is to cut pastry leaves and place on the top crust before
brushing with egg. Makes it look very professional.
