Preparation Time: 0:17 1. Peel bananas; cut each crosswise in half.
Insert a wooden pop-type stick into the cut end of each banana piece.
Wrap tightly in plastic wrap or in a plastic freezer bag and freeze
until firm, 2 hour or overnight.

2. In a small microwave-safe dish, combine chocolate chips and peanut
butter. Heat in microwave on High about 1 1/2 mins, until chocolate is
melted when mixture is stirred. Using a knife, spread mixture evenly
over bananas (some of the mixtue will harden immediately). Wrap in
wax paper or plastic wrap and freeze until chocolate is firm and set,
15 to 20 mins.

Wrap well and store in freezer.

Note; This is an excellent way to use up extra ripe bananas.
