Title: Grain Info and Cooking Chart 1
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 info  Forms of Amaranth

Whole Grain Amaranth: The grain is quite tiny and has been compared
in size with millet. The varieties range in color from buff yellow to
darker purple and black. However, the commercial grains are generally
quite pale in color. The grain has an appealing, nutty, almost
peppery flavor.

Amaranth Flour: Now available across the country in health food
stores. It offers a high-quality protein, and when it's mixed with
whole-wheat flour, the resulting protein balance is close to that
recommended for optimum nutrition.

Amaranth Pastas: Can be found in health food stores. Most are blended
with wheat flours.

Commercial Breakfast Cereals: Most of the breakfast cereals sold in
health food stores now contain amaranth, sometimes mixed with as many
as six other grains.

In addition, amaranth can be popped and eaten very much like popcorn
(Note: it turns rancid very quickly after being popped).
