Title: Phyllo Pies
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
Bottle would be cheaper and
Equally effective)
1 ea Flour and sugar, 50-50
Mixture, about 1/2c per cup
To cup and a half of fruit.
1 ea Fruit, drained - I used
Pineapple, cherries, and
Strawberries
1 ea Phyllo dough
1 ea Pam or other spray oil
(regular oil in a pump spray
Any fruit would work fine, I think.  Take the fruit and thaw if
frozen and drain.  Mix the flour/sugar mixture into the fruit.  The
flour thickens the remaining juices of the fruit so it hopefully
won't make the pastry soggy, and sugar for sweetness (this amount of
sugar is to MY taste, vary to adjust for desired flavor).

Take a few sheets of the phyllo dough and roll the rest back up.  The
phyllo dries out very quickly. Fold each sheet of dough into fourths
(fold in half and then in half in the other direction), put a
spoonful of fruit in the middle of the dough, and fold the dough over
the fruit into a neat little package. Put the package onto a cookie
sheet sprayed with Pam. When the cookie sheet is full, spray the tops
of all the packages with Pam to keep it from burning.

Bake in a 325 F oven for about 20 min - until a light golden brown
color on top.

Source: A while back someone suggested putting a slice of pineapple
in a folded sheet of phyllo dough. I took their recipe and modified
it a little.
