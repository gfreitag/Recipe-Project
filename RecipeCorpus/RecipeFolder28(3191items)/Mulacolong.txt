The marching rhythm of this name is entrancing.  It's origin is as
mysterious as the flavor of the dish itself.

A bird which has reached the age politely spoken of as "uncertain" may
serve as the piece de resistence of any dinner and reflect glory on
the hostess if it is prepared in this manner.  Young chickens may
also be cooked using somewhat less veal stock and reducing the time
of cooking. 1 fowl 1 large onion, chopped 3 pints veal stock 1 Tbsp.
lemon juice 1 tsp. turmeric salt and pepper Cut the fowl in pieces
and fry it until it is well browned.  Then add the chopped onion to
the fat and allow this to brown also.  Add the veal stock, which
should be very strong, and the turmeric mixed with the lemon juice.
Season with salt and pepper and cook until the chicken is tender. The
stock should cook down so that it forms a rich gravy which should be
served over the chicken. ++ Carolina Housewife From: 200 Years of
