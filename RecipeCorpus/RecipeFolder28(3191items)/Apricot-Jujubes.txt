Title: Apricot Jujubes
Categories: Cake/cookie, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
2    OR
3 tb Rum or brandy
Shelled pistachio nuts
8 oz Dried apricots
Approximately 1/2 teacup
-icing sugar
1 tb Ground coriander
Use soft, preferably sun-dried apricots.  The authors feel that
Iranian, Afghani or Israeli are the best.

Put the apricots through a mincer or food processor until they are
finely chopped.  Place in a mixing bowl, add the icing sugar slowly,
a little at a time, and knead with your hands until it is fairly
stiff. Add the coriander and rum or brandy.  The mixture should be
moist but not sloppy. Shape into marble-sized balls, roll in the
remaining icing sugar and place a peeled pistachio nut in the center
of each ball. Leave overnight to dry and then store in airtight tins
or boxes. Put them in individual paper cases if you have any.
