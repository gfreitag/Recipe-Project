Categories: West europe, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1    Or 2 bitter almonds,
-blanched & skinned
2 T  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Cream, whipped until
-stiff
1 qt Milk
1/2 c  Long-grain rice
1/2    Vanilla bean, split
-lengthwise
1/4 c  Sweet almonds, blanched &
-skinned
MMMMM------------------------CHERRY SAUCE-----------------------------
1 T  Potato flour
1 1/2 c  Canned cherries
1/4 c  Cherry liqueur
Boil the milk in a thick-bottomed saucepan.  Add the rice and vanilla
bean, stirring all the time with a whisk or a wooden spoon in figure
8 movements until the mixture boils.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and
let the rice cook gently until tender.  Leave to cool. Meanwhile,
chop the almonds coarsely, keeping aside 1 whole sweet almond, if it
is Christmas. Fold the almonds, sugar and whipped cream gently into
the cool rice mixture. When all the ingredients are well mixed, pour
into your best crystal bowl and finally put in the whole almond. Keep
in the refrigerator until ready to serve. To make cherry sauce, heat
the drained cherries in a saucepan and add the cherry liqueur.  Mix
the potato flour to a thin paste with a little cold water and pour
slowly into the cherries, stirring gently all the time, but do not
let the sauce boil. Serve the hot sauce in a sauceboat with the ris
a' l'amande.  The contrast between the cold pudding and the hot sauce
is delicious.  If you prefer a cold cherry sauce, just mix the
cherries in syrup with the liqueur and serve as before. Needless to
say, a small glass of cherry liqueur goes well with this rich dessert.
