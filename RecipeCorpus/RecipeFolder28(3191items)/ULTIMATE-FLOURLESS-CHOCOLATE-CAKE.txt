Make the cake:
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees F.
Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-2 1/2-inch round springform
pan.
Line the bottom of the pan with a round of parchment or waxed
paper and
butter the paper.

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the
chocolates,
sugar and coffee for 15 to 20 seconds until finely ground.
With the motor of the food processor running, pour the boiling
water
through the feed tube. Process for 10 to 15 seconds, until the
chocolate
is completely melted. Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of
the work
bowl. Add the butter and process for about 5 seconds, or until
incorporated. Add the eggs and vanilla and process for about 5
seconds,
just until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape the chocolate
batter
into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula.

Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until the edges of the cake are puffy
and the
center is just set. Cool the cake in the pan set on a wire rack
for 30
minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until
ready to
serve.

Make the raspberry coulis:
In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen raspberries and sugar.
Cook
over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until
the
sugar is completely dissolved and the berries are soft. Do not
let the
mixture boil. Strain the raspberry mixture through a fine-meshed
sieve
into a bowl. Stir in the raspberry liqueur. Cover and refrigerate.

Decorate the chocolate cake:
Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cake to loosen it
from
the sides of the springform pan. Remove the side of the
springform pan.
Invert the cake onto a serving plate. Peel off the paper.
Refrigerate
the cake while you prepare the whipped cream.

In a chilled large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at
medium
speed, beat the cream with the sugar and vanilla just until stiff
peaks
begin to form.

Using an offset metal cake spatula, spread a thin even layer of
whipped
cream over the top of the chocolate cake. Fill a pastry bag
fitted with
a star tip (such as Ateco #6) with the remaining whipped cream.
Completely cover the top of the cake with whipped cream rosettes.

To serve, drizzle some of the raspberry coulis onto each dessert
plate.
With a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the cake, wiping the blade
clean
between each slice. Place the slices on the dessert plates, and
garnish
with fresh raspberries if desired.
