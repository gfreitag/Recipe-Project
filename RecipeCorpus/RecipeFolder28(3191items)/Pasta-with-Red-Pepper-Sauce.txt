In a large skillet, cook the fresh red peppers and garlic in the oil
over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes (OR, if
using peppers from a jar, cook the garlic in the oil in a 2-quart
saucepan for 3 to 4 minutes or until light brown).  Place half of the
peppers and all of the garlic in a blender or a food processor.
Cover and blend or process until nearly smooth.  Add half of the
water, basil, tomato paste and vinegar.  Cover and blend or process
with several on-off pulses until the basil is just chopped and the
mixture is nearly smooth. Transfer to the 2-quart saucepan.  Repeat
with the remaining peppers, water, basil, tomato paste and vinegar;
transfer to the saucepan. Cook and stir the sauce over medium heat
until heated through, Serve the sauce over hot cooked pasta, topped
with shredded Parmesan cheese. Makes 4 main-dish or 8 side-dish
