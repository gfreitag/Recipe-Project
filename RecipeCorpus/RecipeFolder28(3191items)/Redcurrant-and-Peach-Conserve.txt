Title: Redcurrant and Peach Conserve
Categories: Dips/spread
Yield: 1 batch
Juice of 2 lemons
2 1/2 lb Sugar
3    -fluid ounces Kirschwasser;
-optional
2 lb Redcurrants; stalks and all
10    -fluid ounces water
2 lb Peaches; quartered but not
-skinned (crack the stones
-and save the kernels)
Simmer the redcurrants with the water until they are completely
disintegrated.  Mash them through a sieve extracting as much pulp as
possible.  Put the pulp back into the pan with the peaches, kernels
and lemon juices and simmer until the peaches are just tender, about
15-20 minutes.  Add the sugar and stir over a low heat until it is
dissolved. Bring to the boil and continue boiling until just set
(when a few drops on a cold plate crinkle when pushed with your
finger). Take the pan off the heat while testing for a set.  Stir
once or twice and leave for 20 minutes to cool slightly.  Add the
Kirsch after 10 minutes and stir in. Ladle into clean, warm, dry
jars, cover with waxed discs and cellophane or screw-on lids.

Any fruit or combination of fruits can be used allowing 3/4 lb of
sugar to each pound of fruit or pint of pulp.

The authors suggest using this on bread or as a filling for a sweet
omelette.
