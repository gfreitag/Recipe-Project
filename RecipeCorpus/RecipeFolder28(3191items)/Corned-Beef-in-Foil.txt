Title: Corned Beef in Foil
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Irish
Yield: 8 servings
1 ea Onion, sliced
1 ea Celery stalk, sliced
1 ea Carrot, peeled, sliced
4 lb Corned Beef brisket
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Pickling spices
1 ea Orange, unpeeled, sliced
Soak corned beef in water to cover for 30 minutes or longer if deeply
corned. Preheat oven to 300 degF. Remove the corned beef from the
water and pat dry to remove any salt on the surface. Place a large
sheet of heavy duty foil in a shallow pan or cookie sheet. Place the
corned beef in the center of the foil and pour 1/4 cup fresh water
over it. Sprinkle the meat with the pickling spices, then arrange the
orange slices, onion slices, celery and carrot over and around the
meat. Bring the long ends of the foil up over the meat and seal with
a tight double fold. Seal the other ends, turning them up so the
liquid cannot run out. Bake for 5 to 6 hours. Discard the cooked
orange and vegetables. Let stand for 20 minutes before slicing.
