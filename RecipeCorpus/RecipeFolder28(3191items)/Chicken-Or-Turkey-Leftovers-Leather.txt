Title: Chicken Or Turkey Leftovers Leather
Categories: Chicken, Turkey, Snacks
Yield: 1 servings
Broth to make thick paste
1 ea Batch leftover poultry
Carefully remove bones from leftover cooked chicken or turkey.  Avoid
using very fatty pieces, which make the leather too greasy.  Put the
bits and pieces of meat into blender, with enough liquid (chicken
stock, broth, and/or water) to blend.   Be sure to add any leftover
dressing. Season to your liking, but keep in mind it will get
stronger as it dries.

Dry the same as you would for basic leather.  Cut into squares or
tear off strips to eat.

Origin: Dry It - You'll Like It! circa 1973.
