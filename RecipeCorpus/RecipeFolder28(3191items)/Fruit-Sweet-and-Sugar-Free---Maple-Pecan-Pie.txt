Categories: Diabetic, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1    Basic pie crust, bottom
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3/4 c  Pure maple syrup
3/4 c  Fruit sweetener
6    Eggs
1 3/4 c  Pecans
1 t  Cinnamon
1/2 t  Salt
1 t  Vanilla extract
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
8    Pecan halves
Whipped Cream
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare and partially bake the pie crust
according to the directions. Toast the pecans in the preheated oven
for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reserve 6-8 perfect pecan
halves for garnishing the finished pie. Put the remaining pecans in
the partially baked pie crust. In a medium bowl, combine the
cinnamon, salt, vanilla and 1/2 cup of the maple syrup. Use a whisk
to evenly distribute the cinnamon. Then whisk in the remaining 1/4
cup of maple syrup and all of the fruit sweetener. Whisk in the eggs,
one at a time. Pour this filling into the crust, over the pecans.
Bake the maple pecan pie for approximately 45 minutes on a cookie
sheet on either the floor of a gas oven or the lowest shelf in an
electric oven. Maple Pecan Pie is done when it is golden brown, has
puffed slightly, and does not shake in the middle when jiggled. When
the pie is cool, garnish it with whipped cream and toasted pecan
halves. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   03-11-95
