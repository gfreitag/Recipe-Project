Title: Jamaican Jerk Rub
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 batch
2 tb Dried thyme
2 tb Mustard seeds
3    Scallions; finely chopped
1 ts Each salt and black pepper
2    Limes; juice only
1/4 c  Cheap yellow mustard
2 tb Orange juice
2 tb White vinegar
1/4 c  Inner Beauty or
-- other Caribbean hot sauce
-or-
10    Pureed Habaneros OR
15    Chile peppers; pureed
2 tb Dried rosemary
2 tb Chopped parsley
2 tb Dried basil
Combine all ingredients in a food processor or blender; blend them
into a paste, making sure that all the ingredients are fully
integrated. The paste should be approximately the consistency of a
thick tomato sauce. If it is too thick, thin it out with a little
more white vinegar.

Cover paste and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours
for the flavors to blend together. Overnight is the ideal amount of
time to give them to get acquainted. (Note: If you want to avoid
making a fresh batch every time you make this dish, you can multiply
the amount of paste easily. Don't worry about it going bad, since it
keeps almost infinitely). Rub paste on meat and grill. From: Cathy
