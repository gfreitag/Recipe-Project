Title: Sweet Potatoes with Cider and Brown Sugar
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
1    Stick unsalted butter
2" piece of cinnamon stick
4 lb Sweet potatoes, peeled and
Cut into 1-inch chunks
2 1/2 c  Unsweetened apple cider
In a large nonreactive saucepan, combine the potatoes, cider, brown
sugar, 6 tablespoons of the butter and the cinnamon stick.  Bring to
a boil over moderate heat.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, partially
cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are very
tender, about 45 minutes.

Let cool slightly, remove the cinnamon stick, and pass the potatoes
through the medium disk of a food mill or puree in batches in a food
processor. Transfer to an overproof serving dish.  The potatoes can
be prepared to this point up to 4 days ahead.  Cover tightly and
refrigerate.  Return to room temperature before proceeding.

Preheat the oven to 325F.  Dot the potatoes with the remaining 2
tablespoons of butter, cover with foil and bake, stirring once or
twice, for about 20 minutes, until steaming.  Remove the foil and
bake for 5 minutes longer.
