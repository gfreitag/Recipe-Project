Title: Barley Casserole or Richard+
Categories: Vegetarian, Ussr
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Chicken broth
1 c  Dry lima beans
1 c  Hulled barley, dry
1 lg Onion, chopped
1/2 lb Mushrooms, chopped
Soak lima beans overnight.

Saute mushrooms and onions in butter. Add barley and brown lightly.
Add beans and stir. Season broth and pour over other ingredients in
buttered casserole. Cook 25 minutes in 350 degree F. oven. Add 2nd
cup of broth and uncover. Continue cooking till broth is absorbed,
top is brown and a little crusty and beans and barley are done.

A beanpot is a great cooking utensil for the dish.

This recipe is highly unusual, hereabouts. My husband ate it as a
little boy. His mother brought the recipe from the Ukraine. The only
other time I heard it mentioned by the name "Richard" was in an
interview with Rudolph Nureyev, before his death. He said that
"Richard" was one of his most favorite dishes when he was small.

The mushrooms are optional, that's something I added.
