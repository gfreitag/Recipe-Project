Preparation Time: 1:30

1. Preheat the ocen to 375 F. Plce the butter in a large shallow
roasting pan and put in the oven to melt. Meanwhile, in a pie plate,
whisk the buttermilk and egg. On a piece of wax paper, toss the
flour, with the ground pecans, sesame seeds, paprika, salt, and
pepper.

2. Dip the chicken pieces into the buttermilk mixture, then coat with
the pecan mixture. Roll the chicken in the melted butter, then
arrange in a single layer in the roasting pan. Top each piece with a
pecan half if you wish.

3. Bake the chicken, uncovered, without turning for 1 hour or until
golden and the juices run clear when a thigh is pricked with a fork.

4. Meanwhile, prepare the cherry tomatoes: In a 12-inch nonstick
skillet, melt the butter over moderately high heat. Add the tomatoes,
sugar, and salt. Stir and shake the skillet for 4 mins or just until
the tomatoes are heated and their skins start to wrinkle. Arrange the
chicken on a platter and surround with the tomatoes. Serve with
mashed potatoes and succotash.
