Title: Substitute Bisquick #3
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Salt
1 ts Cream of tartar
1 c  Shortening
5 c  Flour
2 1/2 tb Baking powder, double acting
2 tb Sugar
Sift dry ingredients together.  Cut in shortening with pastry blender
until it resembles crumbs.  Store in airtight container up to six
weeks at room temperature, or freeze for up to six months.

Sylvia's comments:  This was just as easy to mix using a stand mixer
and worked just as well as the other two. However, since it has a lot
more ingredients and required more effort to measure than the others,
I'm dumping it from MM.
