Russet potatoes and thin, tender pork strips soak up the fragrance and
flavor of Chinese five-spice. The bottled spice blend is sold in many
markets, but if you can't find it, you can easily make your own.

Peel potatoes and cut crosswise into 1/2 inch thick slices; cut large
slices in half. Set aside.

Place a wok over high heat; when wok is hot, add oil.  When oil is
hot, add pork and garlic.  Stir-fry until pork is browned (2-3
minutes). Add potatoes, water, soy, sugar and five-spice. Bring to a
boil; then reduce heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasonally,
until potatoes are tender when pierced (about 20 minutes). Garnish
with onions.

* We prefer double the amount of sauce.
