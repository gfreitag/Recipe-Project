Preparation Time: 0:40 1. In a 1-qt glass measure, combine 10 oz
chocolate and butter. Heat in microwave on High 1 to 1 1/2 mins,
until melted and smooth when stirred. Stir in jam and liqueur until
well blended. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or
overnight.

2. Using a melon baller or small ice cream scoop, scrape mixture into
1-inch balls. (If mixture is too hard, let stand at room temperature
1/2 hour before shaping.) Place truffles on wax paper-lined baking
pan and freeze firm, 1 hour or longer.

3. In a small glass dish, place remaining 12 oz chocolate. Heat in
microwave oven on Medium 3 to 3 1/2 mins, stirring often, until
melted, smooth, and warm. Using a fork, dip truffles quickly, one at
a time, into chocolate, tapping fork on edge of dish to shake off
excess. Place on wax paper-lined baking pan. Repeat dipping process,
stirring chocolate often and scraping down sides of dish, if
necessary, to prevent chocolate from hardening. Refrigerate until
chocolate is set, about 1/2 hour. Wrap in an airtight container and
store in refrigerator 2 weeks or in freezer 1 month. Serve in paper
candy cups.

NOTE: Truffles can also be rolled in finely chopped nuts and sifted
unsweetened cocoa powder instead of dipping in chocolate. Roll in
nuts or cocoa immediately after shaping into balls. Store as directed
above.
