NOTE: USE ONLY FLOWERS IF YOU HAVE NOT USED INSECTICIDES IN YOUR
PLANTING AREA.

Select and pick the blossoms in the early morning before it is too
warm. Take a bowl of water with you. When you cut them off leave a
bit of stem and immediately put the stems in water. When you come in,
cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and store in the
refrigerator until you are ready to prepare in the evening.

To Prepare, remove the internal portions of the flower and leave only
the petals. Wash the flowers well to remove any dirt and bugs that
may have clung to them, and cut off the stems. While you are
preparing the flowers, take cream cheese from the refrigerator to
soften. Mix the softened cream cheese with a single egg yolk, sour
cream (or yogurt), grated hard cheese, (Use cheddar, Swiss,
provolone, or feta) and the Parmesan cheese. Add the green onion or
chives and salt to taste.

Gently open each blossom and spoon in about a teaspoonful of filling.
Twist the end to close.

Put some flour into a shallow dish. Beat the 2 eggs. Roll each filled
blossom in the flour and then dip in the beaten eggs.

Heat about 1/4 inch oil in a large skillet and fry each blossom until
golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.
