Title: Advent Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 batch
-softened
pn Cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla
1 lb Plain flour (approximately)
1    -teacup molasses or black
-treacle
7 oz Light brown sugar
9 tb Cocoa powder
10 oz Butter or margarine;
Preheat the oven to 400F.  Mix all of the ingredients together,
except for the flour.  Add the flour slowly to the rest of the
mixture until it reaches the right consistency to roll out.  The
dough should be quite soft. (You may find it easier to knead it with
your hands.) Roll out on a floured surface to a thickness of about
1/4 inch and cut into decorative shapes with small cookie cutters, a
sharp knife or the rim of a glass. Place on a greased baking sheet
and bake in the oven for about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven while
they are still soft and cool on a rack, then pack into crocks or jars.

The authors note that the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers made these at
Thanksgiving and stored them in a stoneware crock until Christmas. The
cookies can be made at any time, but allowed to age for 4-6 weeks.
They can be used as a substitute for graham crackers for a pie crust.
