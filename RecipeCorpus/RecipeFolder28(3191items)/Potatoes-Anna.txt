Title: Potatoes Anna
Categories: Vegetables, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Dried thyme or oregano
1 T  Parsley
1/2 c  Mozzarella cheese, grated
-(or your preference of
-cheese)
1/2 c  Butter
1 lb Sweet potatoes (about 2)
2 lb Potatoes (about 5 baking)
1 t  Pepper
1/2 t  Salt
Clarify the butter by heating it and allowing it to sit for a while.
Skim off the foam and pour off the clarified butter leaving solids
behind. Discard foam and solids.  Peel and slice the sweet and
regular potatoes into thin slices as you would for scalloped
potatoes. Blot with paper towel to get the excess moisture off.
Layer into a baking pan one kind of potatoes, then the next, brushing
with butter. Mix the spices together and sprinkle then on top of the
butter.  Repeat until all potatoes and spices are used.  Bake in 450F
oven for 15-20 minutes, covered. Remove top and continue to bake for
another 10-15 minutes until the tops are browned and slightly crispy.
If desired, you can pop under the broiler for a minute or two for
added browning.  Drain off any remaining butter. Sprinkle with
parsley and some grated mozzarella cheese if desired. Allow to stand
while cheese is melting, and serve immediately. Origin: Adapted from
