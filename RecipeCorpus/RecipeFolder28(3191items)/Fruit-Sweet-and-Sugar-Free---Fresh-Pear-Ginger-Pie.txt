Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare and partially bake the pie
crust according to the directions. Prepare the almond milk by
blending 1/3 cup blanched almonds with one cup of water for five
minutes in a blender. Strain the liquid through a piece of dampened
cheesecloth. Measure, and add additional water if necessary to make
one cup of almond milk. Peel the fresh pears with a vegetable peeler
and cut them in thirds, lengthwise. Remove the cores, then slice the
pear sections into 1/4 inch slices along the width of each section.
Place the sliced pears in the bottom of the partially baked crust. In
a small bowl, mix the filling ingredients together in the order
listed, mixing in the almond milk last. Pour this mixture over the
pears. To bake the pie place it on a baking sheet in the preheated
oven, directly on the oven floor of a gas range, or on the lowest
shelf of an electric oven. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the custard
has set slightly. Meanwhile prepare the steusel topping. Use either
an electric mixer or a food processor to combine all the topping
ingredients, except the butter or margarine, until crumbly. Cut the
cold butter or margarine into 1/2 inch pieces. Add them to the
topping, mixing with a pulsing action of the food processor or on
medium speed of an electric mixer, just so the topping is crumbly. Do
not make a smooth mixture. Remove the pie from the oven, cover the
custard lightly and evenly with the steusel topping. Return the pie
to the oven and continue to bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the
streusel is brown. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   03-11-95
