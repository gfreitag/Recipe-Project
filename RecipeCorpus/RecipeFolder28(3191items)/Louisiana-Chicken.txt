Preparation Time: 1:30

1. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over a moderately high
heat. Add the chicken and cook for 4 mins on each side or until
browned, then transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon.

2. Add the onion, carrots, and celery to the skillet and saute for 5
mins. or until tender. Return the chicken, along with any juices that
have collected, to the skillet; add the stock, thyme, and bay leaf
and bring to a boil.

3. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 45 mins or until the juices
run clear when a thigh is pricked with a fork. Discard the bay leaf;
reserve the cooking liquid, skimming off any fat. Line a warm serving
plate with the noodles and arrange the chicken on top. Cover with
aluminum foil to keep warm.

4. In the same skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the
flour and cook for 1 min or until bubbly. Whisk in the milk and the
cooking liquid from the chicken. Cook for 3 mins or until thickened,
then remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon juice, salt and pepper.
Ladle the gravy over the chicken and top with the parsley. Makes 4
servings.
