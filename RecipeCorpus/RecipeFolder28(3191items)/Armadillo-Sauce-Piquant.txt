Prepare armadillo meat by cleaning and cutting into serving pieces.

minutes before cooking.

In a heavy black iron pot, brown sausage and armadillo in hot oil,
permitting meat to stick to bottom of pot just a little for extra
flavor. Remove armadillo from pot and set aside leaving sausage in
pot. Add onions, green pepper, garlic and celery; stir continuously,
cooking until tender. Add steak sauce, pick-a-peppa sauce, salt,
pepper, MSG, and Worcestershire sauce; mix well.  Add armadillo and
water. Heat to boiling; reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce
to low heat and cover with tight lid. Cook until tender.  (Do not
stir but take pot by handle and half-spin from left to right every 10
minutes). Add mushrooms and wine; blend gently with a spoon.
Sprinkle with parsley and lay thin lemon slices on top. Simmer
uncovered for 15 minutes.  Serve over rice.

NOTE:  Clear stew meat may be substituted for armadillo, if desired.
