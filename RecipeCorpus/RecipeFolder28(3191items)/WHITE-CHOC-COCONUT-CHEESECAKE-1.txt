Make the chocolate macadamia nut crust:
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees F.
Remove the side from a 9-by-3-inch spring form cake pan. Trim a
9-inch
cardboard cake circle so that it fits within the curved lip of the
bottom of the springform pan. Cover the bottom of the pan with a
piece
of aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang all around the edge.
Carefully attach the side of the pan. (Lining the bottom of the
pan this
way will give the cheesecake an even flat base, making it easy to
remove
from the pan.)

In a medium bowl, stir together the chocolate wafer crumbs, ground
macadamia nuts, and toasted coconut. Add the melted butter and mix
well.
Press the mixture evenly onto the bottom of the prepared pan.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the crust is puffy and bounces
back when
gently pressed with a finger. Cool on a wire rack.

Prepare the coconut topping:
In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir together the toasted
coconut,
flour and salt. Add the butter cubes and with your fingers toss to
distribute thoroughly. Chill until ready to bake the cheesecake.
