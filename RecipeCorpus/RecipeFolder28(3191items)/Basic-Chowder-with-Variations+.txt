3 lg Potatoes
1 lg Onion
2 cn Evaporated milk
1 qt Stock or water
2 oz Salt pork (or 2 tb. butter)
I found this recipe in the Loaf and Ladle cookbook from the
restaurant of the same name, published in 1979.

Peel and dice potatoes and put them on to boil in salted water or
stock to cover. Peel and dice the onion.

If you use salt pork, cut it into 1/4" pieces, and cook in a frying
pan over low heat until enough fat is rendered to saute the onions.
Remove salt pork pieces from the pan and cook the onions in the
rendered fat. When the onions are transluscent, add them to the
cooked potatoes. (the potatoes are ready when you can bite into them,
and they are still firm. Do not overcook them).

Return the salt pork bits to the frying pan and continue to cook them
until they are brown and crispy. Reserve them for garnishing the
chowder. If you prefer, use butter or margarine to saute the onions.

The milk should be added just before serving and brought to heat. Do
not boil.
