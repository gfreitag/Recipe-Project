Title: Chicken and Ham Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Poultry, Main dish, West europe, Irish
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Thyme, dried
Salt & pepper
1 c  Peas, uncooked
1 ea Pastry crust, to cover
3 lb Broiling chicken
2 lb Ham
1 ea Onion, large, sliced
3 ea Bay leaves
Put the chicken and ham in a large pot and cover with water.  Add the
onion, bay leaves, thyme, and salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, turn
down the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the
chicken is very tender.  Turn off the heat and let stand, covered,
for 1 hour. Discard the bay leaves.

Take out the chicken and ham, and carve them into slices, discarding
the chicken bones and ham rind if there is one.  Set the pot aside.

Preheat the oven to 400 degF.  Layer the chicken and ham slices in an
8" deep dish pie pan, shaking some of the peas and boiled onion from
the pot on each layer.  When the layering has been completed, add the
liquid from the pot, but no higher than 1/2 inch from the rim of the
pie pan.

Dip your finger in the liquid, and wet the rim of the pie pan.  Lay
the pastry over the dish, press down, and crimp with a fork. Trim off
the overhang, and make three slits in the center of the dough (for
escaping steam). Brush the pastry with milk, and put it in the oven
for 15 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 degF, and continue baking
for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pie crust is nicely
browned.
