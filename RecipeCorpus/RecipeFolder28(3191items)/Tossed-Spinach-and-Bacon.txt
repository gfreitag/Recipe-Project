Several hours ahead: To 3/4 cup bottled or homemade French dressing,
add 6 cloves garlic, quartered. Hard-cook 3 eggs. Thoroughly wash 1
lb. crisp young spinach. Refrigerate all. Shortly before serving: In
skillet over low heat, fry 8 slices bacon until very crisp, pouring
off drippings as bacon cooks. Drain bacon; then crumble. Into salad
bowl, tear cleaned spinach into bite-size pieces; sprinkle crumbled
crisp bacon on top. Remove garlic from dressing; pour dressing over
salad; toss thoroughly. Cut shelled, hard-cooked eggs into large
chunks; arrange around outer edge of salad, pushing them down into
greens a bit. Serve at once. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
