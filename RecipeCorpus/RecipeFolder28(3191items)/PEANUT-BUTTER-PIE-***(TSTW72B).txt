Title: PEANUT BUTTER PIE ***(TSTW72B)
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SHELL--------------------------------
1/4 c  Sugar
1 2/3 c  Graham cracker crumbs
3/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream; chilled
1/4 c  Chopped unsalted peanuts
3 oz Cream cheese; softened
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1/4 c  Milk
1 c  Smooth peanut butter
This is a creamy, rich, peanut butter pie that all peanut butter
lovers would die for!  It's soft, like cheese cake, yet has the
crunch of peanuts in each bite.

SHELL:  In a food processor combine the shell ingredients and mix
well. Press into a 9" pie plate. Bake at 425 degrees for 9 minutes.
Set aside.

FILLING:  Beat the cream cheese and sugar till light and fluffy. Beat
in milk, peanut butter and vanilla. In a chilled bowl, beat the cream
until it holds stiff peaks. Fold in 1/3 of the cream into the peanut
butter mixture. When mixed, add the rest of the cream, and gently
fold in till completely mixed.

Turn the filling into the baked shell, and sprinkle with the chopped
nuts. Chill covered, for at least 4 hours, up to overnight.

NOTE** If you want chocolate on it, melt Toll House bits and drizzle
over the top in a pretty pattern.
