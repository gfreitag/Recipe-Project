Title: Nectarine and Raspberry Preserves
Categories: Fruit, Can/preserv
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 c  Raspberries (1 pint)
6 lb Large nectarines (unpeeled
And sliced) - 8 cups
3 c  Sugar
Combine the nectarines with the sugar and lemon juice and let stand,
covered, overnight in the refrigerator.

Place a colander in a large shallow preserving pan and pour in the
nectarine mixture.  Let the juices drip into the pan for at least 30
minutes.  Remove the colander with the fruit to a bowl and bring the
juices in the pan to a boil over high heat.  Boil rapidly for 20 to
30 minutes, or until reduced by half.  Add the nectarines and any
additional juices to the syrup in the pan and continue to cook voer
high heat for 10 minutes.

Carefully stir in the raspberries and cook for 5 minutes more.  The
nectarines will look lightly glazed and the syrup will be only
slightly thickened.  Ladle the preserves into hot sterilized jars,
wipe the rims clean with a damp towel, and seal with new lids and
metal rings.  Process in hot-water bath for 5 minutes.  Remove, cool,
check seals, label, and store.

Makes 8 half-pint jars.
