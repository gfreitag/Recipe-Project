Categories: Fish, Chinese
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Oil
1 1/2 ts Thin soy sauce
1 ts White wine
1 ts Oyster sauce
3/4 lb Raw prawns
1 1/4 tb Black beans
1    Clove garlic, chopped
1    Green onion, chopped
1 tb Oil
Prepare the prawns by cutting off whiskers, cutting along the top of
the shell, and deveining them.  Leave the shells on the prawns
because this keeps the prawns more tender, tasty and plumlp. Wash,
drain and put prawns in a pie pan so as to be ready for steaming.

Wash black beans two times and mash into a paste; then add the chopped
garlic.

Combine remaining ingredients, EXCEPT the oil.

Pour mixture over prawns; then, pour oil on top.

Cover and steam 10 minutes.  Serve over rice.
