DOUGH: Measure 1/2 c warm water in a bowl. Add sugar
and yeast and stir to dissolve. Let stand at least 5
minutes to proof (froth forms on top). Meanwhile, sift
together into a large bowl the white flour, wheat flour,
corn meal and salt. Make a depression in the middle and
add 3 Ts of the olive oil and 1 c warm water.
Add yeast mixture. Mix all ingredients with your hands and
gather together and place on floured board. Knead about 10
minutes, adding more flour if dough is sticky, to form a
smooth, elastic mass. Grease a large bowl with olive oil.
Add dough, turning it to coat top. Cover and let rise in
warm place, draft-free location until doubled in size (45
minutes for fast rising yeast, 1 1.2 hours for regular).
While dough is rising make sauce by melting butter in a
saute pan. Add garlic and saute for one minute. Add
tomatoes and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add
cream, basil and oregano and bring to a boil, remove from
divide into 6 equal pieces and, on floured surface, roll
out to desired shape about 1/2 inch thick. Coat both sides
of shaped crust with olive oil, then place on grill
directly over fire until upper surface begins to bubble
(about 2 minutes). Fire must be very hot and grill must be
clean (coals should be red with a small flame, like a
steak fire; this is important). Watch crust closely and
rotate with spatula if necessary. Remove crust and turn
cooked side up (it should be golden brown). Brush with
olive oil, sauce, cheese and desired toppings. Sprinkle
some olive oil over each pizza. Return for final cooking
(2-4 minutes), rotating for even cooking.
