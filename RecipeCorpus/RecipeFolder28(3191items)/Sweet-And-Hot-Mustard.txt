Combine the dry mustard and vinegar in a small bowl with a cover.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Beat eggs and sugar until well blended. Add to mustard mixture and
pour into the top section of a double boiler. Keep water in lower
section just at simmer temperature. Cook, stirring constantly, until
thickened and smooth (about 7-8 mins). Pout into jar with a tight lid
and store in refrigerator. This is best if you allow it to mellow for
a day or two before using.

Makes about 2 cups.
