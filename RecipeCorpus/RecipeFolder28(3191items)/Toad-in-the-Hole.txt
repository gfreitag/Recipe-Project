MMMMM------------------FARMHOUSE KITCHEN VOL II-----------------------
1 1/2 lb Sausages
1 1/2 oz Drippings
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
2    Eggs
7 fl Milk
7 fl Water
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 pn Sea salt
Black pepper
Mix flour, salt and pepper in a bowl, make a well in the centre and
drop in the eggs.  Beat well, gradually incorporating the flour and
adding milk and water. Whisk for 4 to 5 minutes. Put drippings in a
large roasting tin and place in hot oven, Gas 8,450F, 230C. Leave for
5 minutes to get smoking hot.  Pour in batter and space sausages
evenly in it. Bake for 40 minutes, reducing heat to moderately hot,
Gas 6, 400 F, 200C, if batter is browning too quickly.

Sylvia's comments: "Toad" is an amazingly flexible dish.  First of
all, I use only 1/4 of the amount of sausage called for.  This time,
I used browned bulk sausage sauteed with bell peppers and diced
zucchini, poured the whole mess into a greased 8x8" pan, and it came
out great. I stuck on the "didn't like" classification because (a)
the first Toad recipe I tried was at least as good and (b) the
quantity for 4 servings just barely fit in my blender with lots of
fussing. If I have to set up the mixer every time I want to make
something, I won't make it often.
