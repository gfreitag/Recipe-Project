"To serve in the the old-fashioned way, crumble saltines or cornbread
in bottom of a bowl, then spoon chili on top.  If you are planning to
serve it this way, you'll need to add 1 additional cup broth or water
to the chili during cooking, so you'll have plenty of liquid in the
bowl to take up the crackers or bread.  Add grated cheese on top if
you wish."

Cook ground beef, onions, and garlic in a Dutch oven until beef is
browned, stirring to crumble.  Drain in a colander. Return beef
mixture to Dutch oven and add remaining ingredients except beans,
stirring well.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer 40
minutes.  Add beans; simmer, partially covered, 20 additional minutes.
