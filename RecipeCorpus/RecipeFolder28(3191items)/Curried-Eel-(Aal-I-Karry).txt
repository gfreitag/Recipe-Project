Title: Curried Eel (Aal I Karry)
Categories: West europe, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Flour
1 tb Butter
1    Scant teaspoon curry
1    Or 2 eels
1 lg Onion
Parsley
One large or two small eels are suitable for 4 persons.  Skin the
eel, cut in pieces as long as a finger and put in boiling salt water
with a top of parsley.  Use water enough to cover only half the fish,
so the stock will be good and strong.  Cook the eel until it is
tender and keep it hot while making the sauce.  Melt butter in a pot,
brown a large onion and add flour and curry.  Dilute with the fish
stock until the sauce is thick enough. Taste it, and if it is not
strong enough add more curry. Pour it over the eel, serve in a deep
dish and have an extra dish of fluffy steamed rice.
