SAUCE: In Dutch oven or similar large, heavy pot, combine broth, oil,
onion, garlic, and mushrooms. Cook over medium heat, stirring
frequently, or until onion is tender, 5 or 6 mins. If liquid begins
to evaporate, add a bit more broth. Add carrot, tomatoes, tomato
sauce, tomato paste, sugar, basil, thyme, salt, if desired, and
pepper; stir to mix well. Add chicken breasts.

Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 35 to 40 mins,
stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and flavors
are well blended. Remove chicken. When cool enough to handle, cut
into 1/2-inch strips and return to pot. Stir to mix well. Rewarm
sauce when polenta is finished.

POLENTA: (NOTE; Tested and created for 900 watt microwave; adjust
times to fit your microwave.) After sauce has cooked 20 mins, combine
cornmeal, sugar, salt, if desired, water, milk, and onion in 2 1/2-qt
microwave-safe casserole. Stir to mix well. Microwave, uncovered, on
high 8 to 9 mins, stopping and stirring with wire whisk after 3 and 6
mins. After cooking, stir again with wire whisk until mixture is
smooth. Cover with casserole lid and microwave an additional 6 to 7
mins on high. Remove from microwave and let stand an additional 3 to
4 mins. Serve individual portions of sauce over polenta.
