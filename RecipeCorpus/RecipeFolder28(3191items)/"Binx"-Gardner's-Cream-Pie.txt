Title: "Binx" Gardner's Cream Pie
Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart
Yield: 12 servings
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Vanilla
1 2/3 c  Sugar
2 qt 40% cream
6    Egg whites
2 tb Flour
Hand beat egg whites until somewhat frothy.  Combine flour, sugar
and salt and add to egg whites; beat until smooth, losing grainy
look. Add vanilla.  Beat again.  Add cream and stir until well
blended. Have ready a baking dish, Pyrex or deep metal pan (milk pan)
lined with a short pastry which has been chilled in refrigerator for
some time. Pour cream mixture into crust and bake in a very slow
oven, 250 ~275 degrees F., for 4 hours. It must not boil.  Best done
the day before and allowed to set.

This cream pie, a fifth or sixth generation recipe, has a custard
like texture and a delicious flavor.  A. K. (Binx) Gardner had the
recipe from Mrs. Obadiah Gardner, his mother, who had it from her
mother and grandmother.  The pie is cooked in a very slow oven for 4
hours and allowed to set for at least another day before it is
served. This is a large pie. A small "sliver" of the pie makes a good
dessert.
