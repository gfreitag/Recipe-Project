Stephen Ceideburg
2    Chicken breast halves
1/2 c  Slivered fresh lemon, with
-peel
3 tb Fish sauce
1 1/2 ts Chopped hot chile pepper, or
-to taste
2    Green onions, thinly sliced,
-including part of green top
[I prefer galangal--even dried, to ginger, but ginger will do.  S.C.]

Place chicken breasts in pan with just enough cold water to cover.
Bring to a boil over medium heat; immediately reduce heat so water
barely ripples. Simmer uncovered, until done, about 12 minutes.  Meat
should be moist and opaque throughout; cook only to just beyond pink
stage. Remove breasts and drain well.  Cool to room temperature;
remove and discard skin and bones. Shred meat into bite-sized pieces.
Reserve. Combine slivered lemon, fish sauce, chile pepper, green
onion and sugar; set aside. Combine coconut milk, chicken stock,
lemon grass, mushrooms and galangal in a sauce pan over medium-high
heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until lemon
grass is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add reserved chicken and
lemon mixture and heat through, about 3 minutes.

Serves 6 to 8 as a first course or 4 as a main course.
