Going through some old boxes, I came across this recipe from the June,
1963, issue of Better Homes and Gardens. It is credited to a Mrs. T.A.
Hight, Walnut Creek, CA. Even after all these years it still sounds
pretty good. Combine melted butter, soy sauce and Tabasco; drizzle
over noodles. Toss lightly till noodles are well-coated. Sprinkle
noodles with celery salt and onion powder.  Again, toss until well
mixed. Place on a baking sheet and toast at 275 for 12-15 minutes or
until lightly browned and crispy. Makes about 2 1/2 cups.
