Title: Party Sandwiches
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 12 sandwiches
3    Tomatoes
1/2    Red onion
Vinaigrette dressing
-- preferably homemade
12    French bread rolls, 8-10"
3    Carrots; shredded
1/2    Hothouse cucumber
3    Avocados
20    Fresh mushrooms
Slice French rolls in half lengthwise.  Score the cucumber lengthwise
evenly down all sides of the peel with the tines of a fork.  Peel and
pit avocados; cut into slices.

Using a very sharp knife or (preferably) a mandolin, slice cucumber,
mushrooms, onions and tomatoes into very thin slices.  Set each
vegetable aside separately.

Drizzle a little dressing over the bread halves.  Place some carrot
shreds on each bottom half, then layer on the mushrooms, avocado
slices, a little more dressing, the cucumbers, onions and tomatoes.
Place top halves of bread over filling and slice each sandwich in
half, securing each portion with a long wooden pick.
