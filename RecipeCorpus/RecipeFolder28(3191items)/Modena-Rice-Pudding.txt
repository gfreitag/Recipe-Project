-heat.  Turn the heat down
-to low, cover tightly,
And cook 20-25 mminutes at
-a very slow bubble.  Stir
-occasionally to
Check for sticking.  When
-the rice is tender but
-still a little
Resistant to the bite (it
-will be a little soupy),
-stir in the sugar.
Turn it into a bowl and
-allow it to cool.  Butter
-a 9 inch springorm pan
With the 1-1/2 tbsp butter.
- Preheat the oven to 350F.
-Stir the eggs,
Lemon zest, and citron or
-almonds into the cooled
-rice.  Turn into the
Pan, and bake 55-65
-minutes, or until a knife
-inserted 2 inches from the
Edge comes out clean.  To
-serve at room temperature,
-cool the pudding to
Room temperature on a rack,
-and then unmold.
-REfrigerate if you will be
Holding it for longer than
-2 hours.  Slice into
-narrow wedges.  Serve
Warm by reheating the
-pudding in its mold at
-325F about 20 minutes.
Then release the sides of
-the pan and set on a round
-plate.
The food of grandmothers,
-this baked rice pudding is
-scented with citron
Or almond.  Baking
-burnishes it to a glowing
-gold and makes it firm
Enough to be sliced like a
-cake.  Although made
-throughout the region,
This rendition from Modena
-was shared by Catherine
-Piccolo of the
MOdena/St. Paul Minnesota,
-Sister City Committee.
-This pudding is the
Dessert served after Sunday
-dinner in farmhouses on
-the Po River plain.
It is pulled from the cold
-pantry for special quests,
-and is especially
Favored around Easter time.
- The pudding can be made 1
-day ahead.  Wrap
The dish and store it in
-the refrigerator until 1
-hour before serving.
It is equally good served
-warm from the oven or
-chilled.
