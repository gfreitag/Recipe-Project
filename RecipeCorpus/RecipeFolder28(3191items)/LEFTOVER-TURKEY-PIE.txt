Title: LEFTOVER TURKEY PIE
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 servings  An old friend managed to find this recipe for me.  It is simple but
extremely tasty.

1.5 cups cooked turkey (cubed) 1 cup cooked potatoes (cubed) 1 cup
cooked vegetables (try peas & carrots mix) 1 10 oz. can of cream of
chicken soup 1/2 cup milk 1 tbsp. minced onion 1/2 tsp. poultry
seasoning

CRUST:  1 cup Bisquick mix
1/4 cup milk

Combine the first seven ingredients in a medium casserole dish. Bake
uncovered at 450 F for 15 minutes then stir. Meanwhile prepare biscuit
crust using milk and Bisquick.  It should
be firm enough to knead and roll - not too sticky.  Cut out
biscuits in circles or decorative shapes and lay on top of
hot turkey and vegetables. Bake uncovered at 450 F for another 15
minutes.

For a thinner pie, use a larger dish and double the biscuit recipe.
