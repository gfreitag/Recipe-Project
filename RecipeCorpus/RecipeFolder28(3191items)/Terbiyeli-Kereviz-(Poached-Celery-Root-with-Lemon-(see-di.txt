Name; Poached Celery Root with Lemon and Egg Sauce

With a small, sharp knife, peel the celery roots and cut them
crosswise into Â« inch wide slices.  Drop the slices into a heavy 3 to
4 quart saucepan and add the bunch of parsley, 1/4 cup of lemon
juice, salt and water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce
the heat to low. Simmer covered for about 20 minutes, or until the
celery root is tender but still slightly resistant to the point of a
small, sharp knife.
Remove and discard the bunch of parsley.  With a slotted spoon,
transfer the celery root to a heated serving bowl, and cover with
foil to keep it warm.
With a whisk or a large spoon, stir the flour and water mixture
into the liquid remaining in the pan.  Still stirring, cook briskly
over high heat until the liquid comes to a boil, and thickens
lightly. combine the beaten egg with the remaining 2 teaspoons of
lemon juice in a small bowl. Beat in about 1/4 cup of the simmering
sauce and pour it into the saucepan, stirring constantly.  Simmer for
a moment and taste for seasoning. Pour the sauce over the celery
root, sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve at once.
