Preparation Time: 3:30 1. Drain syrup from raspberries into a medium
saucepan; set berries aside. Whisk cornstarch into syrup until
mixture is free of lumps. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture boils, clears, and thickens, 2 to 3 mins.
Stir in corn syrup, orange liqueur, and raspberries. Sieve to remove
seeds, if desired. Cover and refrigerate sauce until chilled, 2 to 3
hours.

2. Preheat oven to 325 F. To prepare crust, in a medium bowl, mix
together coconut and butter. Spread evenly over bottom and partway up
sides of 9-inch springform pan that has been lined with a double
thickness of foil (to catch any butter that may leak through). Bake
20 to 25 mins, or until golden. Let cool.

3. When sauce and crust are both cold, assemble cake. Spread half of
ice cream evenly over cooled crust. Spoon half of cold raspberry
sauce over ice cream. Top with remaining ice cream, spreading evenly.
Freeze cake until set, 1 to 2 hours; refrigerate remaining sauce.

4. Spread remaining raspberry sauce over top of cake. Cover and freeze
until firm, 4 hours or overnight. Cut into wedges to serve.

NOTE: For Ice Cream, choose raspberry chocolate truffle or your
favorite chocolate flavor.
