Brown the meat in a nonstick skillet, breaking it up as it cooks. Do
not add oil to the pan; the meat will release enough fat for frying.
Drain off any accumulated fat after the meat has browned. In a bowl,
combine the cottage cheese, egg, Romano cheese, garlic salt, pepper,
oregano, and parsley. In a 2-quart shallow baking dish, arrange the
meat, noodles, cheese mixture, and tomato sauce in layers. Sprinkle
the bread crumbs evenly over the top. Bake the lasagna in a preheated
350F oven for 30 to 45 minutes....
