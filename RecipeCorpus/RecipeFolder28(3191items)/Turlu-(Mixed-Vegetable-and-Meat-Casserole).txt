In a heavy 5 to 6 quart casserole, heat the butter over moderate
heat until a drop of water flicked into it sputters instantly.  Add
the meat and brown it lightly, turning the pieces frequently with a
spoon and regulating the heat so they color quickly and evenly
without burning. Stir in the onions and Â« teaspoon of the salt,
reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and simmer for 30 minutes, or
until the meat is tender and shows no resistance when pierced with
the point of a small, sharp knife.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  Scatter the string beans
evenly over the meat, then in separate layers, spread the eggplant,
squash, okra, potatoes, tomatoes and green peppers on top.  Sprinkle
the vegetables with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and a few
grindings of pepper, and pour the water over them.  Bring to a boil
over moderate heat, then cover tightly and bake in the middle of the
oven for about 1 hour, or until most of the liquid is absorbed by the
vegetables. Serve at once, directly form the casserole.
