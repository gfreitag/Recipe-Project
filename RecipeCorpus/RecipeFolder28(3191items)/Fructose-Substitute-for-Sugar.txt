Substitute fructose in recipes calling for sugar. Since it is a
natural sweetener there should be appreciable change in blood sugar
levels.

Fructose does not break down in cooking like some artificial
sweeteners.

General rule of thumb is to use 1/3 less fructose than the amount of
sugar called for. It can be used in all diets, but diabetics should
check with their doctors if there's any doubt about using it.
