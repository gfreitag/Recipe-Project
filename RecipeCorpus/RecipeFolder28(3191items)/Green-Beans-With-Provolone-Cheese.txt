1. Cook beans in a large saucepan of boiling salted water 5 mins;
beans will still be crisp. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold
running water. Drain well.

2. In a large frying pan, cook garlic in oil over medium heat until
fragrant, about 30 secs, being careful not to burn. Add beans to pan
and stir to coat with oil. Add water to pan and cook, stirring
occasionally, 3 to 4 mins, or until crisp tender. Season with salt
and pepper.

3. Remove pan from heat. Add provolone to hot beans and toss. Serve
immediately.
