Grease two 8 or 9 inch square pans.  Set aside 2 T of the dry muffin
mix. In large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water (105 to 115

remaining dry muffin mix, 2 c of flour, soup and 1/4 cup of the
melted butter; mix just until dry ingredients are moistened.
Gradually stir in remaining 2 c flour to form a stiff dough.  Knead
on floured surface until smooth, about 1 minute. Cover; let rest 15
minutes.

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Divide dough in half; press into greased
pans. Cut each into 8 strips.  Drizzle remaining 1/4 c melted butter
over loaves; sprinkle with reserved muffin mix.  Cover; let rise in
warm place 12 to 15 minutes or until light.

Bake at 375 degrees for 18 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.
Immediately remove from pans.  Break apart or cut with knife.

Serve warm. Maxine Bullock, TN.
