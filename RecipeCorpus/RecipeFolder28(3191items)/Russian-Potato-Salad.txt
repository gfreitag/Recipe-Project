Title: Russian Potato Salad
Categories: Salads, Russian, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
3 ea Whole scallions, thinly
-sliced
2 t  Kosher salt
1/8 t  Black pepper
3 lb Small red or new potatoes,
-cut in half or thirds,
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/2 c  Sour cream
2 T  Fresh dill, finely chopped
In a pot, place the red or new potatoes in enough water to cover.
Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender, but still
firm enough to hold their shape.  Drain. In a large bowl, place the
cooked potatoes. In a bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream,
dill, scallions, salt, and pepper.  Add the mixture to the potatoes.
Mix well and serve. Makes 8 to 12 servings. NOTE: This salad is
especially delicious if you serve it while the potatoes are still a
little warm, but it's still very yummy when cold. Well covered and
refrigerated it stays good for 4 to 5 days. Recipe: Mama Leah's
