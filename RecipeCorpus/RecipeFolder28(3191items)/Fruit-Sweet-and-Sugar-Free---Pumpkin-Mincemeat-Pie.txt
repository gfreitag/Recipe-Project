Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare and partially bake pie crust
according to the directions. To prepare the Mock Mincemeat filling,
combine the raisins, apples, orange zest and juice, and the apple
juice in a medium size saucepan. Cover the pan and cook over medium
heat until the apples are soft, 10-15 minutes. Remove the pan from
heat. While the apple mixture is cooking, toast the walnuts in the
preheated oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the
nuts to cool. Then medium chop them with a knife or pulsing action in
a food processor. When the apples are ready, stir in the sweetener,
the spices and the chopped walnuts. Refrigerate. To prepare the
pumpkin custard, whisk together the pumpkin, salt, spices and vanilla
in a medium size bowl. Stir in the sweetener and the eggs. When the
mixture is smooth, stir in the milk. Spread the chilled mincemeat
evenly in the bottom of the partially baked crust. Pour the pumpkin
custard over the mincemeat to fill the crust. To bake the pie, place
it on a baking sheet in the preheated oven, directly on the floor of
a gas oven or on the lowest shelf of an electric oven. Bake the pie
for approximately 45 minutes until the pumpking custard no longer
wiggles when you shake the pan. When the pie is cool, garnish it with
whipped cream and toasted walnuts. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On
