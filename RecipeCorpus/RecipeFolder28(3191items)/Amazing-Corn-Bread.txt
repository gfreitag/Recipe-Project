Title: Amazing Corn Bread
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Salt (I omit)
1    Apple made into applesauce*
3/4 c  Skim milk
2    Egg whites
1 c  Cornmeal
1/2 c  Flour
1 tb Baking powder
3 tb Sugar
Preheat oven to 425f. Grease a pan ( I used a medium vision pot
sprayed lightly with Pam) and put in oven to preheat. Mix all
ingredients, pour batter into heated pan and bake for 20 min.

This cornbread was quite moist and flavourful. I'd cut the sugar down
or out if you were going to serve it with chilli or something like
that. It is really great hot out of the oven with molasses. (It was
the molasses discussions that got me thinking about ff corn bread. I
have succesfully kept in an airtight container over night in the
fridge....sorry, it doesen't last any longer!

*To make applesauce quick I cut up 1 apple and put in a bowl with a
bit of water and then microwave on high for about 2 min. Then I use
my handblender to make it into sauce. Make sure you do this in a
tall, thin container as it tends to spit up and hot apple sauce
really burns! One apple makes about 1/3 of a cup so you could use
storebought for this.
