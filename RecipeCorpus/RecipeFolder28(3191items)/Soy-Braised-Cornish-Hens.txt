1 tb Sugar
4    Cornish hens (1 lb ea)
3 tb Soybean or corn oil

1. Heat oil in large enameled cast-iron casserole. Add scallions,
garlic, ginger, star anise and Szechwan peppercorns and cook over
moderately high heat until fragrant and vegetables are golden, about
5 minutes. Add soy sauce, sake or dry sherry, sugar, and 1 cup of
water and simmer gently for 10 minutes.

2. Add hens to casserole, breast sides up. Cover, reduce heat to
moderately low, and simmer, turning hens every 10 minutes, until the
juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a fork, about 40
minutes. Remove from heat and let hens stand covered for 10 minutes.
Transfer hens to a platter; loosely cover with foil and keep warm.
Strain braising liquid and skim off fat.

3. Serve with Coconut-Pineapple Sweet Rice and a little of the soy
braising liquid.
