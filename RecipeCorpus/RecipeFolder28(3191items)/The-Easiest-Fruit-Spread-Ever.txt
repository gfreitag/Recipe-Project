Title: The Easiest Fruit Spread Ever
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 /2
1 ea Water to cover
1 lb Dried fruit (i.e. apricots)
This may be obvious to everyone else, but I've just discovered how to
make lovely "fruit butter."  get a pound of dried fruit (I used
apricots). put in a heavy saucepan with enough water to cover. simmer
for two hours. if there is a lot of liquid left, but the fruit is
plump and tender and breaking up, turn up the heat and evaporate the
water away until there's just a tad, like maybe 1/2 cup. pour this
into a blender and puree for about a minute. comes out just a bit
stiffer than baby food. really really rich and tasty, sweet and tart.
perfect for my cream of wheat in the morning.  and toast.
