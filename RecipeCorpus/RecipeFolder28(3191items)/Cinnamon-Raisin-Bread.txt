Title: Cinnamon-Raisin Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 10 servings
2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
1 c  Raisins
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Cinnamon; ground; or to tast
2 tb Butter or margarine; melted
5 1/2 c  Unbleached or bread flour
2 pk Active dry yeast; or
2 tb Active dry yeast; bulk
1 c  Milk
3/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
Stir 2 cups of flour and the yeast together in a large mixing bowl.
Heat the milk, water, 1/4 cup sugar, oil and salt in a saucepan over
very low heat until very warm, (120-130 degrees F.).  Add the liquid
mixture to the flour-yeast mixture.  Beat, with an electric mixer at
medium speed, until smooth, about 3 minutes.  Blend in the egg and
then stir in the raisins.

Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately
soft dough, (It will be slightly sticky and light in weight).  Turn
the dough out on a lightly floured surface, adding flour if needed as
you knead the dough, and knead until smooth and satiny about 10
minutes.  Cover the dough
with the bowl and let rest for 20 minutes.  Combine the 1 cup of
sugar and the cinnamon, then set aside.  Punch the dough down and
divide in half. Roll out one half, on the floured surface, to a 14 X
7-inch rectangle. Brush with the melted butter and sprinkle with half
of the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Beginning at the narrow end, roll up
tightly like a jelly roll. Press the edges to seal and fold the ends
under. Place in a greased 8 1/2 X 4 1/2 X 2 1/2-inch loaf pan.
Repeat for the second half.  Brush the tops   of the loaves with the
remaining butter. Cover and let rise in a warm   place until doubled,
about 45 minutes.  Bake in a preheated 375 degree F.   oven for 35 to
40 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow when tapped.    Remove
from the pans immediately and cool on wire racks.
