Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM------------------------HERBED HENS-----------------------------
2 ts Oregano, finely chopped
Salt and pepper
4    Cornish hens (1 lb ea)
2 tb Olive oil
6 lg Garlic clove(s)
-thinly sliced
2 ts Thyme, finely chopped
2 ts Rosemary, finely chopped
MMMMM-------------------------MUSHROOMS------------------------------
3 tb Olive oil

1. Prepare the herbed hens: preheat oven to 400øF. In a small bowl,
combine garlic, thyme, rosemary, and oregano and season with salt and
pepper. Loosen breast skin of each hen with your fingers. Spread a
quarter of the herb mixture under the skin of each bird, rubbing it
over the breasts and thighs.

2. Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Add 2 of the hens and
cook over moderately high heat, turning with tongs, until browned on
all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a large roasting pan and
brown the remaining 2 hens. Roast the hens for 10 minutes. Lower oven
temperature to 300øF and continue cooking for about 30 minutes, or
until the hens are golden and the juices run clear when a thigh is
pierced with a fork. Cover loosely with foil and keep warm.

3. Prepare the Portobellos: heat a grill pan or cast-iron skillet over
moderately high heat. Brush the Portobello caps on both sides with
some of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill or
pan-fry, turning often, until the mushroom juices are exuded and the
caps are browned, about 8 minutes; brush the Portobellos with the
remaining oil from time to time. Thinly slice the caps and keep warm.

4. To serve, set a Cornish hen on each of 4 large warmed plates. Pile
the mushrooms around the hens. Spoon any pan drippings over the hens.
