" "Garam marsala" means "hot spices" and is generally added to foods
near the end of cooking or as a garnish. This homemade version is
superior to store bought, which is usually heavy on the cheaper
spices and not as fresh. Make this in small quantities so that it
stays fresh. Cardamom seeds (not pods) available in East Indian food
stores, are used here as they give a more delicate taste. Regular
cumin seeds can be substituted for the black cumin seeds."

Place ingredients in clean electric or spice grinder. Turn machine on
30 to 40 seconds or until spices are finely ground. Store in small
jar with tightly fitted lid. Keep away from heat and sunlight. MAKES
