This is a famous dish in Rome, where nearly every good restaurant
offers it with pride. It is said to have originated in the Abruzzi
region, known for its lusty but simple dishes, although I never found
it there. It should be made with the cheek of a young pig, using all
of the lean and half of the fat. Often it is made with a small hot
red pepper chopped in, but as I had it in Rome, a sweet pepper was
substituted and bacon was used rather than pork cheek. 2 small white
onions, chopped 2 pounds fresh tomatoes, 1 sweet red pepper, chopped
peeled and diced 1/4 pound salt pork, diced Liberal amount of
milled 3 tablespoons olive oil black pepper 8 slices of bacon, diced
1 pound bucatini (thin 4 cups (one 2-pound can) macaroni)
Italian plum tomatoes or, 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup grated Romano
cheese Saute onions and pepper with salt pork in the oil until pork
is nearly crisp but not too hard; stir, add bacon, and cook for 5
minutes. Blend in tomatoes, mill in pepper, and stir. Taste for
seasoning. If salt is needed, add to taste, but salt pork and bacon
should make it sufficiently salty. Stir well and simmer, uncovered,
for 40 minutes. Cook bucatini al dente, drain. Place in a bowl with
the butter, toss, add the cheese, mill in black pepper, and toss
again. Serve pasta in individual hot bowls, with a liberal spooning
of the sauce over each portion. Serves 4 to 6.
