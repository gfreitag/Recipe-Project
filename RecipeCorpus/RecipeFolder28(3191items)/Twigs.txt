Just a personal note about these treats. I can recall my mom, aunt and
Grandmother (Polish) getting together before Christmas and making a
cookie almost identical to these called Hrusty (love knots). They
would make them together a typical cold snowy Saturday. My Dad did
the frying in our basement where he had a gas burner set up near one
of the windows so the fumes went outside. Of course, a supply of
"cold ones" was close by, 'cause this was hard work. My job was to
bring cutting boards loaded with the cut and twisted knots from the
kitchen down to the basement. They made bushels of these, which were
kept in the "cold room" we had in the basement. There were always
some left for the Easter table. I have seen similar recipes in many
cookbooks, but this is the closest to the ones we made and still do
when the spirit moves us.

Combine milk, eggs, liquor, sugar and salt in a large bowl. MIx well.
Gradually add flour, enough to make a stiff dough. Turn out on a
floured board and knead until smooth. Roll out thinly and cut into
approximately 36 5-by-1-inch strips. Make a lengthwise slit down the
center of each strip, allowing 1 inch on each end uncut. Put one end
of the dough through the slit to form a sort of loop. Deep-fry in hot
fat (375X F. on a frying thermometer), about 10 at a time, until
golden. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain. To serve, sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar and cinnamon. Makes about 3 doz.

NOTES : These cookies take their name, khvorost, from the Russian
word for firewood kindling - twigs or branches - which they somewhat
resemble.
