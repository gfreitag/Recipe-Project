Preparation Time: 1:05

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 10 x 15-inch jelly-roll pan and
line with parchment or wax paper. Lightly grease parchment.

2. In a large bowl, beat together eggs and 2/3 cup sugar with an
electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 mins.
Beat in melted butter. Sift together flour and cocoa and fold into
egg mixture along with orange zest. Spread batter evenly in prepared
pan.

3. Bake 15 mins, or until cake springs back when touched in center.
Immediately turn cake out onto a large sheet of wax paper sprinkled
with remaining 1 Tbs sugar. Peel off parchment. Starting at one short
end, gently roll up cake in wax paper with paper inside cake. Let
cake cool rolled up, then unroll cake and spread Orange Curd Filling
to within 2 inches of edges. Roll up cake gently from short side,
jelly-roll fashion (without paper). Wrap in plastic wrap and
refrigerate 6 hours or overnight.

4. In a small glass bowl, combine chocolate and cream. Heat in a
microwave on High 40 to 60 seconds, or until melted and smooth when
stirred. Stir in Grand Marnier. Just before serving, drizzle
chocolate Grand Marnier sauce on top of cake.

ORANGE CURD FILLING

In a small saucepan, combine orange juice, eggs, butter, sugar, and
orange zest. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until
mixture thickens, about 10 mins. Do not boil. Whisk in cream cheese.
Cover and refrigerate until chilled before spreading on cake roll.
