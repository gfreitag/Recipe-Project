The word 'veronique' indicates green grapes.  Paired with chicken,
cream, and white wine, they make a surprisingly elegant dish. Heat
the butter and oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. add
the chicken and sautee, turning once, until the meat turns white,
about 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and keep warm.  Add the wine to
the pan and bring to a boil, scraping up the browned bits from the
bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir the cream into the pan.
Boil, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about
5 minutes.  Add the chicken and grapes. Heat through. Serves 4.
