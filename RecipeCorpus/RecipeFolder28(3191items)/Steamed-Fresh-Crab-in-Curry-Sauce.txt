Categories: Chinese, Fish
Yield: 4 servings

1 lg Whole fresh crab
6    Slices ginger root
2 tb Dry sherry
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 ts Ginger, minced
1    Clove garlic, minced
2 tb Peanut oil
Cornstarch paste
1/2    Bell pepper, diced
1 ts Curry powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1 c  Stock
Make Sauce:  Heat oil in medium-hot saucepan.  Saute minced garlic
until fragrant.  Add curry powder.  Stir over medium heat for about 1
minute - avoid burning powder. Add stock, salt, sugar and ginger;
bring to boil; cook for 1 minute.  Add bell pepper, which has been
coarsely diced into 1/4" squares; stir in enough thin cornstarch
paste to make a light sauce. As soon as sauce thickens, remove from
heat and reserve. This sauce can be made up ahead and reheated just
before serving.

Clean & Steam Crab:  Pry off plate from crab in one piece. Separate
legs with cleaver; wash all parts, cleaning out junk; cut soft inner
sections of legs into manageable pieces. Carefully crack claws,
keeping them intact. Reassemble crab on oval platter. Before putting
on back, sprinkle meat with dry sherry; lay ginger on top; then put
on back plate. Wash green onions, remove roots, and shred, greens and
all, into 2" sections.

Bring water in steamer to rolling boil.  Steam crab for about 15-20
minutes, depending on size. Meanwhile, reheat curry sauce (or keep
hot in double boiler). Remove steamed crab from steamer; drain excess
water. Lift back plate off crab; pour curry sauce over crab; sprinkle
with onion shreds; return back plate. Serve.
