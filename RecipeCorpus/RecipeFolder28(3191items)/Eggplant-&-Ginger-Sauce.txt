Title: Eggplant & Ginger Sauce
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 4 servings
Half lengthwise
4    4 inch (10cm) eggplants,
Caps removed, and cut in
MMMMM----------------------GINGER-SOY SAUCE---------------------------
Grated
1 tb Soy Sauce
1/3 oz (10 gm; 1-inch cube) fresh
Ginger, peeled and finely
Bring about 4 cups water to a boil in a medium sized saucepan over
high heat. Add Eggplant halves, cut side up, and reduce heat to
medium. Simmer, uncovered, until just cooked (about five minutes)
turning eggplant after about 3 minutes. Test by pricking with
toothpick or skewer. Flesh should be soft but not mushy.

Drain with skin side up., Press gently with your hand to squeeze out
water without crushing. Cool.

When cool, cut each half lengthwise into 1/8 inch slices [I make them
thicker] The vegetable can be cut when hot, but the result is messy.

Mix ginger soy sauce. [I do this first]

Place eggplant slices on a serving plate, and pour sauce over. Can be
eaten hot, at room temp. or chilled.

The recipe calls for small oriental eggplants but if large ones are
used cut them in half, and then cut each half into quarters before
cooking.
