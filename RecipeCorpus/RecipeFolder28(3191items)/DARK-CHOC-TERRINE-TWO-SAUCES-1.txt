Make the dark chocolate mousse:
Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9 1/4-by-5 1/4-by-2
3/4-inch
metal loaf pan. Line the pan with plastic wrap so that the plastic
extends about 1 inch beyond the rim of the pan.

Place the chocolate in a food processor fitted with the metal
chopping
blade. Process for 30 to 45 seconds, until finely chopped.

In a small saucepan, combine the milk, sugar and salt. Cook over
medium
heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves and
the
mixture comes to a gentle boil. With the motor of the food
processor
running, pour the hot milk mixture through the feed tube. Process
for 15
to 25 seconds, until the chocolate is completely melted. Scrape
down the
sides of the work bowl. Add the oil, rum and vanilla and process
for 15
to 25 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape the
chocolate mixture into a large bowl. Let the chocolate mixture
stand for
a few minutes, until tepid.

In the chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer,
using
the wire whip attachment, whip the cream at medium-high speed
until soft
mounds barely start to form and the cream is still pourable. Do
not
overwhip the cream.

Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold one-third of the whipped
cream
into the tepid chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in the
remaining
whipped cream. Do not overfold the mousse, or it will become
grainy.
Scrape the chocolate mousse into the prepared loaf pan and smooth
the
top with the rubber spatula. Wrap the loaf pan in plastic wrap and
aluminum foil. Freeze the terrine for at least 6 hours or
overnight,
until firm. (The terrine can be prepared ahead to this point and
kept
frozen for up to 1 month.)
