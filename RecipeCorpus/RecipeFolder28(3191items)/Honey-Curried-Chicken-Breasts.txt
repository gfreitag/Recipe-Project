Spray a baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Arrange chicken in a
single layer, skin side down if not skinned.  Combine remaining
ingredients in a small bowl, stirring until smooth.  Pour over
chicken. Cover and refrigerate if not cooking immediately.  Bake

chicken is tender. Makes 4-6 servings.
