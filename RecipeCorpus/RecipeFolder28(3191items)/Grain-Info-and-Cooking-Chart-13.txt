Forms of Wild Rice
Yield: 1 info

Wild rice is a high-fiber food source, rich in proteins, B vitamins
and minerals. It has a very distinctive flavor. Although it may seem
expensive, note that wild rice triples in volume when cooked; one
pound can provide thirty servings or more.

Giant (long): This is the super deluxe grade of wild rice, with each
grain about one inch long.

Extra-Fancy (medium): The most popular grade of wild rice; the grains
of equal size and quality and they're clean and unbroken. Generally
used for salads, side dishes and stuffing.

Select (short): It appearance is not a concern, this grade is perfect,
since some grains may be broken or not of uniform length and size.
Ideal for use in baked goods or in soups and stuffing.

Miscellaneous Grades: There are several other grades, including some
that are parboiled or otherwise precooked or processed, with cooking
time thus reduced. There are also white and wild rice mixtures
available on supermarket shelves. The three grades above are the ones
recommended for flavor, purity and the best food value.
