Comment:: Try a Butt Ham (about 15lbs.) Cook it about 3 hours the day
before you want to serve it. Let cool, bone it into 1x1 inch (bite
size) chunks. Pour stock into container. set all in refrigerator. On
day for dinner, simmer the Ham with about a Quart of water for about
2 hours, drain all but about 8 ounces liquid into other stock. Add
the Glaze to Ham & simmer about 1 hour (stir occassionally), serve.
Make gravy from stock if desired. Good Good Good....
