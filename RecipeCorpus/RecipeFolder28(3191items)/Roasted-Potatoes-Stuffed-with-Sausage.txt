Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 1:10

* Use Idaho baking potatoes.

1. With apple corer, hollow out potatoes lengthwise.

2. Mix together sausage, bitters, onion and bread crumbs; blend
well. Use mixture to stuff holes in potatoes. If any sausage remains,
shape into 1-inch balls and set aside.

3. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Place potatoes in one
layer in a greased shallow baking pan. Cover tightly with foil.

4. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 50 minutes or until
tender. Remove foil; put bacon slices over tops so potatoes are
covered. Add sausage balls and bake 15-20 minutes longer or until
bacon is brown and crisp.

5. Serve potatoes with sausage balls. Use part spicy sausage if
you prefer.

NOTES:  An unusual yet delicious new way to serve meat and potatoes.
