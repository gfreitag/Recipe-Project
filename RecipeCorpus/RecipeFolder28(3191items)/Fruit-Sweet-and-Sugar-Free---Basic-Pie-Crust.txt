Cut the cold butter into 1/2 inch squares. Place the flours, salt,
and cold water into the bowl of your food processor or a medium sized
mixing bowl. Use the pulsing action on the food processor cut the
butter into the flour until it resembles coarse cornmeal, or use the
electric mixer on low speed to do the same. It is important with
either machine not to over mix, not to whip air into the mixture, and
not to mix until large clumps begin forming. Add the water all at
once and mix just until the dough comes together. This is just a
matter of a couple of seconds in the food processor, and to the count
of ten when using an electric mixer.

When mixing by hand, use the fingers and thumb of each hand to rub in
the butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Be sure to
life your hands out the bowl while simultaneously using your thumbs
to rub the flour and butter across your fingers. Pour the cold water
into the center of the flour mixture and mix quickly with your hand
to form the dough.

Form the completed dough into a cylinder and wrap in plastic wrap.
Place in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before rolling out.
Then roll and shape according to the directions for the pie.
