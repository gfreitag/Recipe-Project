On the last day of one mountain-cabin vacation I looked for dinner
makings in the fridge and found a lone bottle of abandoned peppers
(roasted sweet peppers, not hot chilies) and one cut-up chicken. With
my favorite fast flourish of just putting two things together I
browned the chicken, poured the peppers and their liquid (everything
but the lid is my motto) into the frying pan, clapped the lid on,
stuck the pan in the oven and waited 45 minutes. Delicious.

Preheat oven to 375!F. Heat large, heavy oven-proof frying pan over
medium-high heat, then add oil. Lightly brown chicken pieces on all
sides. Pour peppers, with liquid, over chicken. Cover pan, transfer
to oven and bake 45 minutes.

Makes four servings.
