This classic central That dish is traditionally made with shrimp or
chicken, but we prefer using oyster mushrooms since they are just as
meaty in texture and yet more subtle in taste. Although it is served
as a soup course in North American Thai restaurants, it actually
falls somewhere between a soup and a curry. In Thailand, it is served
as a condiment to rice, just like any of the other dishes on the
table.

In a medium-sized saucepan, bring stock to a boil and add mushrooms
and chilies. Tie lemon grass and lime leaves or zest together in a
cheesecloth bag and add to the stock mixture. Cook over medium heat
for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender. Reduce heat
to low and add lime juice and fish sauce. Discard the cheesecloth
bag. Serve the soup hot, accompanied by steamed rice.
