2    Stems fresh lemongrass
-(bottom 1/3 of stalk)
1    Half-inch piece Siamese
-ginger (galanga), sliced

3 sm Hot red chilies, seeds and

Note: Save shells from the shrimp, including heads, if available.

This is the quintessential Thai soup aromatic, flavorful,
citrus-scented, delicious. If this doesn't hook you on Thai cooking
and gardening, nothing will. Serves four. Adapted from Southeast
Asian Cookery by Sallie Morris (Grafton Books).

Shell and devein shrimp, reserving heads and shells. Place shells and
heads in a large saucepan. Add water, lemongrass and Siamese ginger.

Using a mortar and pestle, pound two of the chilies with the coriander
roots and add to pan. Add the salt and five of the lime leaves,
shredded into little pieces.

Bring the soup to a boil and simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes. Strain
stock into a clean pan. Don't panic if it doesn't taste wonderful at
this point because the seasoning adjustments will make a big
difference.

A few minutes before serving, bring the stock to a boil, add the
shrimp and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add the nam pla, lemon and lime
juices and the straw mushrooms. Adjust seasoning. The flavor should
be tangy.

Serve in bowls garnished with strips of remaining chili, shredded
lime leaf and coriander leaves.
