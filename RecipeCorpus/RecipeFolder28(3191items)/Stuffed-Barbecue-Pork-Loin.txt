this is o.k.!). Cool to room temperature.  Drain stuffing in a metal
colander over a deep bowl to catch drippings. While draining, proceed
with rest of dish. 3. TO MAKE ROAST: Mix the garlic, cumin, cayenne,
ketchup, soy sauce, and worcestershire sauce.  Add drainings from
stuffing; mix well. Using a spoon, stuff the stuffing into the pocket
of the pork. Close the open end of the pocket with tooth picks or
poultry skewers. 4. Place the pork in a foil-lined roasting dish.
Pour 1 cup of the sauce over the pork, covering it completely.  Roast
in a preheat 350 F. oven for about 45 minutes, basting 2 times and
using half of the remaining sauce to baste each time. Remove roast
from pan. Cover with aluminum foil and let it stand for about 15
minutes before you slice it.  Heat pan drippings and sauce and serve
along side of pork.
