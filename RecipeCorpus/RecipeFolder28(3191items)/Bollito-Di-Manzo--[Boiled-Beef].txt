~- Beef brisket boiled with seasoning vegetables gives you the extra
benefit of the broth to use as needed.  This broth freezes very well.
~---------------------------------------------------------------------
~--- Chop all vegetables quite coarsely. Put beef and vegetables in a
large pot ( a stock pot is ideal) with cold water to cover.  Bring to
a boil slowly over medium-low heat.  As the water boils, remove the
froth that forms as much as possible. Lower heat to simmer, cover the
pot, and cook for 3 hours.  The meat will be very tender and the
broth a light brown. Remove meat from the pot and use in any recipe
that calls for boiled beef. Strain broth and use immediately or
freeze for future use. Submitted By NICK LA ROCCA   On   03-05-95
