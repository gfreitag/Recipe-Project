Title: Indonesian Chicken Sate'
Categories: Chicken, Asian
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Dark molasses
3/4 ts Red Pepper Flakes
1/2 ts Garlic Powder Granules
1/8 ts Ginger
4 lg Skinless, boneless chicken
-breast halves (about 1 1/2
-pounds)
1/4 c  Reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
With meat mallet or bottom of heavy saucepan, pound each chicken
breast to 1/2 inch thickness between pieces of waxed paper. Cut
breasts lengthwise into 1 inch strips. In bowl or plastic storage
bag, place chicken and remaining ingredients and mix well.

Cover and refrigerate at least two hours, stirring or turning bag
occasionally (The longer the marinating time the spicier the chicken).

Thread chicken strips on metal or bamboo skewers. If using bamboo,
soak in water to prevent charring when broiling.

Brush generously with marinade.

Broil or grill 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until chicken is done
and tender, brushing them with marinade frequently. Serve hot with
Peanut Sauce.
