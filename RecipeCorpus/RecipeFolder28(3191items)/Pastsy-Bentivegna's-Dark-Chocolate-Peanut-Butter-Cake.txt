PREPARE THE CAKE: Sift dry ingredients in mixing bowl.  Set aside.
Combine buttermilk and eggs in a separate bowl.  Add to dry
ingredients; mix until fully incorporated.  Add sour cream and mix
until fully incorporated. Slowly add butter and beets, just until
mixed in. Spray a 10" springform with nonstick spray and line with
parchment. Pour in batter and bake at 350 degrees approximately 50
minutes, until sides pull away, but center is soft.  Let cool
thoroughly, run knife around edge and release springform. Invert on a
serving platter. Peel off parchment paper. PREPARE BUTTERCREAM: Whip
butter and peanut butter together until well blended. Slowly add
powder sugar and then add vanilla.  Whip until thick and creamy.
Frost cooked cake with butter cream.  Freeze or refrigerate cake
until frosting is very firm. PREPARE THE GLAZE: Don't start glaze
until frosting on cake is very firm. Heat cream and chocolate in
double boiler, whisking until smooth.  Add corn syrup; whisking until
incorporated.  Strain through a fine strainer. Cool a little, then
pour warm glaze over chilled cake. When glaze has set, put chopped
peanut butter cups around the sides of the cake. If desired, decorate
top with more peanut butter cups dipped in melted dark chocolate and
cooled. Source: The San Diego Union-Tribune, Food Section, Mar. 9,

NOTE: As I watched this being made they said the BEETS gave very
moist base to the cake.  Suggested you wait to until have you served
it, to tell the secret of the beets....you can't even see the beets.
