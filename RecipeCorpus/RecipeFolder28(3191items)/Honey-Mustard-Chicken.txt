Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt
if desired, and pepper. In large non-stick, spray-coated skillet, cook
chicken pieces over medium heat, turning frequently with large wooden
or plastic spoon, 7 to 10 mins or until they begin to brown and are
cooked through. Remove and set aside in medium heat.

In same skillet, combine margarine, onion, garlic, and 3 Tbs broth.
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, 6 to 7 mins or until
onion is tender. If liquid begins to evaporate, add a bit more broth.

Add honey and lemon juice to pan with onions, and stir to combine
well. Stir in remaining chicken broth and salt, if desired. Stir in
reserved chicken, cauliflower and carrot. Bring to a boil. Cover,
reduce heat, and simmer 20 mins or until flavors are blended.

Meanwhile, cook rice according to package directions. Combine water
and cornstarch. Stir into simmering sauce and cook, stirring, until
thickened. Stir in mustard. Simmer an additional 1 or 2 mins.

Arrange rice on large serving platter. Top with chicken and sauce. Or
serve individual portions over rice.
