Title: Char's Potato Salad
Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
-mustard
1 ds Garlic powder
1 ds Salt and pepper to taste
8    Large potatoes
1/2 c  Hellman's Mayoniase
4    Hard boiled eggs
1 ts Dijonaise or Gulden's spicy
Wash, peel, cube potatoes, then boil in lightly salted water until
tender. Chop hard boiled eggs (I use an egg slicer twice, by turning
the first sliced egg).  When potatoes are ready, rinse with cool
water, but it is not necessary for them to be cold.  Mix potatoes,
eggs, mayonaisse, and mustard in medium bowl.  Stir in salt, pepper
and garlic powder. If needed, adjust mayoniasse and mustard amounts
to taste.

Variations:  I use this same basic mayo, mustard, S&P, and garlic
powder combination for all such salads:  tuna, chicken, egg, pasta,
etc. I don't add things like onions, celery, relish, etc., but do add
meats to pasta salad.  Another variation with the pasta salad is
small salad shrimps. The eggs are also in my pasta salad, but not the
tuna or chicken. Everyone seems to like them, yet they are really
easy. Submitted By CHARLENE DEERING   On   02-19-95
