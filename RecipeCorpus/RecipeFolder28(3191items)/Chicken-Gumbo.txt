Fresh okra is not wide available, but frozen okra is sold in most
supermarkets and makes a perfectly acceptable substitute. When
cooking up this gumbo, I'ce only called for a pinch of cayenne
pepper, but you can add as much heat as you like.

1. Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry. Preheat oven to 400'F.

2. Combine first 6 seasonings in a small bowl and rub into chicken
pieces.

3. Place chicken in a shallow baking pan and bake for 15 minutes. Set
aside.

4. Place oil in a large, heavy pot. Add celery, onions, red and green
peppers and garlic; cook over low heat, stirring, for 10 minutes.
Raise heat to medium, add okra and cook, stirring, an additional 5
minutes.

5. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf. Add chicken and
any pan juices to the pot. Cover with reserved tomato juices, making
sure that all the chicken pieces are covered in liquid.

6. Simmer over medium-low heat, partially covered, until chicken is
tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons parsley. Cook,
uncovered, for 15 minutes longer. If gumbo begins to boil, reduce
heat. Adjust seasonings to taste. Garnish with remaining parsley. If
desired, serve hot over cooked rice.

124 milligrams cholesterol.

NOTE: If using frozen okra, defrost it or tinse under cold water, then
proceed. From: Michael Orchekowski (Home_Cooking)
