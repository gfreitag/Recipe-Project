Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate, Godiva
Yield: 5 1/2
-chips
1 c  Milk chocolate chips
4 oz Bittersweet chocolate, cut
-into 1/2-inch chunks
2 oz White chocolate, coarsely
-chopped
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
3/4 c  English toffee bits, such
-as Hershey's Skor
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/8 ts Salt
1 c  Unsalted butter, softened
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Packed light brown sugar
2 lg Eggs, room temperature
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Mini semisweet chocolate
Position one rack in the top and another in the bottom third of
the oven
and preheat to 350 degrees F.

In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir together the flour,
baking
soda and salt until thoroughly blended.

In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the
paddle
attachment, beat the butter for 30 seconds at medium speed, until
creamy. Add the sugars and continue beating for 3 to 4 minutes,
until
the mixture is light in texture and color. Scrape down the sides
of the
bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs one at a time, beating
well
after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.

At low speed, beat in the flour mixture a third at a time,
scraping down
the sides of the bowl after each addition. Using a wooden spoon,
stir in
all the chocolate chips, the bittersweet chocolate and white
chocolate.
Stir in the pecans and toffee bits. The dough will be very stiff.

Drop the dough by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls onto 2 ungreased
baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between the cookies.
Refrigerate the remaining dough. Bake the cookies for 11 to 13
minutes,
or until the cookies are set and the edges are very lightly
browned;
switch the positions of the baking sheets halfway through the
baking
time for even browning.

Cool the cookies on the baking sheets on wire racks for 1 to 2
minutes.
Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool
completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. The cookies can be
stored
in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days or
frozen
for up to 1 month.
