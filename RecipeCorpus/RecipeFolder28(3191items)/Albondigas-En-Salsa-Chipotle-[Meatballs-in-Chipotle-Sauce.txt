Form into 1 1/2-inch balls.  Brown the meatballs in the oil, remove,
and keep warm.

Sauce:

To make the sauce, add the oil to the pan and saute the onion and
garlic until soft.  Add the remaining sauce ingredients, bring to a
boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until the
sauce is thickened. Place the sauce in a blender or food processor
and puree until smooth. Return the sauce to the pan, add the
meatballs, and heat through.

Tortilla Cups:

To make the tortilla cups, pour the oil to a depth of 3 inches and
heat to 375 degrees.  Place a tortilla in the oil and let it float
for a couple of seconds.  Press the center into the oil with a can or
ladle to form a bowl and fry until crisp, remove, and drain.

To serve, place the lettuce in each of the tortilla cups, top with the
albondigas, and serve.
