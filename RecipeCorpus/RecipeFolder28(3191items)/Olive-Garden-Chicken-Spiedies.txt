1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
2 ts Sugar
10    Garlic; mince
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 ts Salt

MARINADE-Add all ingredients except the chicken to a non-aluminum
mixing bowl and mix thoroughly until the sugar and salt are
completely dissolved. Pound the chicken breast between sheets of
waxed peper until an even thickness of 3/16" overall. Cut the chicken
breast meat into 1" squares and add to the marinade, covering
completely. Allow to marinate for 2 hours, refrigerated. Remove from
the marinade after 2 hours and drain.

SPIEDIES-Assemble in the following order: red bell pepper, onion,
chicken (folded into "C" shape on the skewer), green bell pepper,
onion, chicken, alternately, finishing with a red pepper strip after
the 4th piece of chicken on each skewer. Spread the skewered items
out on each skewer, so they will cook quickly. Place the Spiedies on
a grill or a griddle and cook approximately 1 minute per side,
turning 4 times. Adjust the timing according to your equipment's heat
output. Serve immediately, 4 per quest, with dipping sauce, about 1/4
c per serving.

SAUCE-Mix all ingredients together just until blended. Chill 1 to 2
hours to blend flavors. Serve cold. Source: The Olive Garden.
