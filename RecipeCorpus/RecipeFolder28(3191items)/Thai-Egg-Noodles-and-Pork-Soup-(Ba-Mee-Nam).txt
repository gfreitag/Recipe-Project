Categories: Thai, Soup/stew, Pasta, Pork
Yield: 6 servings
3 ea Lettuce leaves
8 sl Pork, cooked, 1-1/2" X 3"
2 ea Green onions, thinly sliced
1 tb Corriander leaves, chopped
1 ts Granulated sugar
2 tb Peanuts, roasted & crushed

1 c  Bean sprouts
8 oz Egg noodles, fresh (Ba Mee)

Blanch the bean sprouts for a minute, then set them aside to drain.
Boil the noodles in plenty of water for five minutes, then drain them.

Next, cook the ground pork in a saucepan over medium heat until it
begins to brown.  Add chicken stock, dried shrimp and fish sauce,
stir, and bring the mixture to boil.

Meanwhile, chop the garlic and fry it in a tablespoon of vegetable oil
until it is crisp.  Place the blanched bean sprouts in the bottom of a
large serving bowl.  Top with the cooked noodles.  Pour the fried
garlic and its oil over top of the noodles.

When the chicken stock mixture boils, tear the lettuce leaves into
strips, add them to the stock, immediately remove the stock mixture
from the stove, and pour it over the noodles and bean sprouts.

Garnish with pork slices, green onions and corriander leaves.
Sprinkle in the sugar, peanuts and chile flakes and serve immediately.

This soup is a Thai adaptation of Chinese egg noodle soup.  It is
typically served as a one-dish lunch sold in soup kitchens.
