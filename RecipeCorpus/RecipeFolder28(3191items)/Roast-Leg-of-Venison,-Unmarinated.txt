Title: Roast Leg of Venison, Unmarinated
Categories: Meats
Yield: 10 servings
1 tb Powdered thyme
3 tb Flour
Salt & pepper to taste
2 1/4 c  Stock or beef broth
10    Larding strips 1 1/2 - 2"
(about 1/4-1/2 lb salt pork)
6 lb Leg of venison
2    Cloves garlic, sliced thin
1/4 lb Butter, softened
1>. Lard the venison with the salt pork, adding the garlic slices
after the salt pork has been inserted. 2>. Rub all surfaces of the
leg with soft butter and dust with the powdered thyme. 3>. Put roast
in uncovered roasting pan, add 1/2 cup liquid, and roast at 3250F for
about two hours. Venison should be srved rare, but not bloody, so
figure about 16 minutes per pound. 4>. Turn off oven, open the door,
and wave it open several times to reduce heat. Place the roast in a
metal pan and keep hot--don not roast anymore. 5>. In the roasting
pan, combine flour and drippings, stirring in the stock. Heat pan on
stovetop and cook on high heat, stirring constantly, until gravy is
thickened to proper consistency.
