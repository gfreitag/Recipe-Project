Preheat oven to 400 F. Scrub potatoes. Make shallow slits around the
middle as if you were cutting the potatoes in half lengthwise. Bake
until done, 30-60 mins.

Steam broccoli until just tender and finely chop.

Carefully slice the potatoes in half and scoop the insides into a
bowl with the broccoli. Add 1/2 cup of the cheese and the margarine,
milk, Lite Salt and pepper. Mash all together until mixture is pale
green with dark flecks. Heap into the potato jackets and sprinkle
with remaining cheese.

Return to the oven to heat through.

Makes 12 servings (1/2 potato each).

(Author's Note) Versatile recipe. Stuffed potatoes can be made ahead
and frozen for emergencies. "Stuffing" can be served in a casserole
if prep time is limited.
