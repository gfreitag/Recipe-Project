Title: Zymi yia Filo (Homemade filo dough)
Categories: Greek
Yield: 2 sheets
5 tb Olive or other vegetable oil
3/4 c  Warm water, approximately
2 tb Butter; melted
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
3 tb Softened butter or margarine
Sift together flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl.  Mix in
butter and oil until well blended, using your fingers, a fork, or a
pastry blender.  Gradually add just enough water so dough sticks
together in a ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for several
hours.

Remove dough from refrigerate and divide into 11 equal portions, 6
for the bottom of the pan and 5 for the top if making a large pita or
baklava.

On a floured surface, roll a portion of the dough into a ball, then
roll the ball out into a large, thin circle.  Spread with melted
butter, repeating with rest of dough.  Stack circles as each is
rolled and buttered.   Use immediately.
