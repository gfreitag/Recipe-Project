Starting with Tortellini from the refrigerated food section of your
grocery store makes preparing this salad extra easy.

Place all ingredients except Tortellini and chicken in blender. Cover
and blend on high speed about 3 minutes, stopping blender
occasionally to scrape sides, until smooth. Cover and refrigerate at
least 2 hours but no longer than 24 hours.

Cook the Tortellini as directed on package; drain. Toss with green
sauce and chicken.
