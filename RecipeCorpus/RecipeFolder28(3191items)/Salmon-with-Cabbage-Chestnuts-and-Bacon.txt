Title: Salmon with Cabbage Chestnuts and Bacon
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
2 tb Unsalted butter
4 tb Finely minced shallots
1 c  White vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
32    Chestnuts
1/2 lb Slab bacon
- cut into 1/2-in cubes
2 sm Red cabbages
- finely shredded
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
5 lb Whole salmon
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Using a small knife, make a slit in each
chestnut and spread them on a cookie pan in the oven for 30-to-35
minutes. Remove from oven and when they are cool enough to handle,
peel them. Place the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat and
cook, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add the cabbage, cover and cook
another 6-to-7 minutes or until well wilted. Remove from heat, add
the chestnuts and transfer to a bowl. Sprinkle the cavity of the
salmon with pepper and stuff with the cabbage mixture. Place the
salmon in a roasting pan and add 1 cup wine and 2 tablespoons butter.
Place in oven, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Turn on its other side and
cook another 15-to-20 minutes, or until just barely cooked at the
bone. While the salmon is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small
saucepan over medium heat, combine shallots, remaining wine, vinegar
and salt. Cook until the mixture is almost dry. Remove from heat and
whisk in remaining butter. Arrange the salmon on a large serving
platter and offer the sauce on the side.
