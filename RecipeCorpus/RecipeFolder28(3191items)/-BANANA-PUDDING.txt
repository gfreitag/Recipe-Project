-and a
Half 12-oz. boxes

"If you are mad at somebody give them a bowl of this pudding...on
second thought, have a bowl yourself!  Then you will both feel
better."

Thoroughly mix 2 1/2 cups of the sugar, the flour, and cornstarch in a
heavy saucepan.  Lightly beat the 8 egg yolks; combine milk and egg
yolks and whisk into sugar mixture.  Add butter and cook over medium
heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened.  Remove from
heat; stir in 1 tsp. of the vanilla.  Cool.  Preheat oven to 425
degrees.  Line bottom of a 13x9x2" baking dish with one-third of
vanilla wafers; layer one-third of bananas and one-third of custard
on top.  Repeat layers twice.  Beat egg whites until foamy; gradually
add remaining 1/2 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp. at a time, beating until stiff
peaks form. Beat in remaining 1 tsp. vanilla. Spread over custard,
sealing to edges.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Chill overnight before serving.

Note:  This makes a huge pan of pudding.  But it is certainly better
after a few days of sitting, and if you go to the trouble to make
your own custard, which is the key to great banana pudding, by the
way, you might as well double the recipe and make a big pan.
