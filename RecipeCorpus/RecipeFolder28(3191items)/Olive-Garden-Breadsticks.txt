Bowl at room temp
Pam
When dough is soft enough to knead, spray your fingers with Pam or
oil and knead just until you can shape into cigar-sized pieces (about
8 to 10). Place these 3" apart on Pam-sprayed cookie sheets. Let rise
in warm place until doubled - about 1-1/2 hours. Then holding Pam
about 8" from sticks, lightly spray top of each and then dust with
garlic powder and oregano. Bake at 375~ about 20 to 25 minutes or
until golden brown. Cool in pan on rack to serve within a day or two.
