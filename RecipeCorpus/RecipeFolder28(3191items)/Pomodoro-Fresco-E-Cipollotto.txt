Title: Pomodoro Fresco E Cipollotto
Categories: Italian, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
-Tomato Sauce
-Green Onion and Fresh
Serves 4

4 green onions, chopped 2 or 3 cloves garlic, minced Extra virgin
olive oil 2 pounds fresh Roma tomatoes, peeled and seeded Fresh
basil, chopped Salt and crushed red chile pepper to taste

In large saucepan over medium heat, saute green onions and garlic in
olive oil until golden. Add tomatoes and basil, crushing them into
the sauteed onions and garlic as you stir. Season with salt and chile
pepper to taste. Simmer and reduce. Toss with any cooked pasta. (I
used a home-made egg pasta based on the bigoli recipe in Bugialli on
Pasta, rolled out very thin and cut in long ruffled ribbons using a
pastry dough cutting wheel.)

Tomato tip: To peel tomatoes easily, first drop them into a pot of
boiling water for a few seconds. The skins will slip right off.
