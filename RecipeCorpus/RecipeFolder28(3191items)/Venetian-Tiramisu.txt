Title: Venetian Tiramisu
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
-- more or less
1/4 c  Strong expresso coffee
3/4 lb Mascarpone cheese*
1 lb Sponge or angel food cake
1/4 c  Heavy whipped cream
1 c  Sugar
3    Eggs; separated
Recipe by: Chef Guiseppi Sestito, Hyde Park Hotel, London, England

* If unavailable you can make it by combining 2 parts whipped cream
and 3 parts cream cheese.

Add sugar to egg yolks. Whisk while holding the bowl over a saucepan
of hot water. Whisk vigorously and quickly, so the egg yolks don't
cook, until sugar is dissovled and fully blended and the mixture has
a creamy appearance. Remove from heat.

Beat egg whites with a wire whisk for about 1/2 minute until frothy.
Add the heavy cream and continue to whisk until fluffy. You can
continue to mix by hand or use an electric mixer for 2 minutes more.

Add 3/4 cups mascarpone cheese to egg yolks. Whisk to incorporate the
cheese. When thoroughly combined add the egg white mixture and
combine.

Slice sponge cake in longs strips. Use the sliced cake pieces to
line the bottom of a 9x13-inch greased baking dish. (Can also use
lady finger cakes or angel food cake in place of the sponge cake.)
Spoon expresso coffee over cake slices, letting it soak in.

Spread half the cream mixture over the cake slices. Place another
layer of cake slices and spread the rest of the cream mixture over
the top. Refrigerate for 2 hours.

Just before serving dust with cocoa powder. Spoon servings onto
serving plates and dust plate and cake with more cocoa powder.
