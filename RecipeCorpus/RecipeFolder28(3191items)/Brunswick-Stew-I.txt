Title: Brunswick Stew I
Categories: Chicken, Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
3 md Potatoes, diced
4 c  Corn cut from cob OR
2 (cans of corn, 1 lb each)
3 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1 tb Sugar
6 lb Stewing hen
(or two 3 lb broilers)
2 lg Onions, sliced
2 c  Okra, cut (optional)
4 c  Fresh OR
2(l lb cans tomatoes)
2 c  Lima beans, frozen
Cut chicken in pieces and simmer in 3 quarts of water for a THIN
stew, or 2 quarts of water for a THICK stew, until meat can easily be
removed from the bones, about 2 1/4 hours.  Remove chicken and let
cool.

Add the vegetables to the broth and simmer uncovered until the beans
and potatoes are tender.  Stir occasionally to prevent scorching.
Add the chicken deboned and diced, or in sections.  Add the
seasonings.

NOTE:  If canned vegetables are used, include their juices and reduce
water to 2 quarts for a thin stew, and 1 quart for a thick stew.

ALSO NOTE:  Brunswick Stew is one of those delectable things that
benefit from long, slow cooking.   It is a rule in some homes never
to eat Brunswick Stew the same day it is made, because its flavor
improves if it is left to stand overnight and is reheated the next
day.
