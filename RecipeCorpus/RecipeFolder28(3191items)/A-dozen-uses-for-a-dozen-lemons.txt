1 Nothing is quite as pretty as a cobalt-blue  bowl filled with
lemons. 2 Italian cooks sprinkle gremolata-a mix of grated lemon
zest, chopped

garlic and parsley-over soups and stews just before serving. 3 After
pitting cherries or slicing beets, remove the stains from your
fingers with lemon juice. 4 Lemon juice, a little grated zest and a
pinch of sugar are the secret ingredients in the best fruit salads. 5
Rub the cut sides of apples and artichokes with sliced lemons to
prevent browning. 6 Hot lemon juice and honey soothe a sore throat. 7
Lemon juice, olive oil and fresh herbs make an easy marinade for
seafood and poultry. 8 Grind used lemons in the garbage disposal to
dispel odors. 9 Why wait until summer? Nothing quenches thirst like
lemonade made from fresh-squeezed lemons. Combine the juice of 8
lemons with 1 cup sugar and 3 cups cold water. Stir in 1 thinly
sliced lemon and serve over ice. 10 Rub a lemon half and coarse salt
over tarnished copper pans to clean them. 11 For a brighter white,
add lemon juice to powdered-sugar icing. 12 Don't want to string
cranberries next Christmas? Dry lemon slices at 150 degrees F on a
parchment-lined baking sheet for 3 hours; thread with a bright ribbon
and tie on the tree. In a pinch, they also make good poker chips
