Preparation Time: 0:35 1. Preheat oven to 375 F. On a lightly floured
sheet of wax paper, unroll crescent rolls, but do not separate. Pat
rolls to form a rectangle; pinch seams together. Lightly flour dough
rectangle; top with another sheet of wax paper and roll with a
rolling pin to a 10 x 15-inch rectangle.

2. Mix cream cheese with jam until smooth. Spread over dough to
within 1 inch of edges. Sprinkle chocolate chips and then nuts evenly
over dough. Roll up from a long side, jelly-roll fashion, pressing
together any loose seams as you go. Cut roll into 9 equal slices.
Place slices cut sides down in a greased 9-inch pie pan; flatten
slightly to fill pan. Bake 20 mins, or until golden brown. Serve warm.
