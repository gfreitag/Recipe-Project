Categories: Breakfast, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Molasses
1 tb Active dry yeast
1/2 tb Salt
2 1/2 c  Water; warm
2 c  Whole-grain wheat pastry flo
2 tb Oat bran
Recipe by: McDougall Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl.
Stir with a spoon not more than fifty times, or until smooth. The
batter will be thin but will thicken as it stands. Cover the bowl
with a towel and place it in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes, or
until the batter is bubbly and thick. Bake in a nonstick waffle iron
on low heat, 5 to 7 minutes. (The iron can be seasoned lightly with
liquid lethicin or oil, if necessary.)

VARIATION: Fold two peeled and grated apples or two mashed bananas
into the batter after it has risen and just before the waffles are
baked. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34, Uploaded June 16,
