Categories: Meats

1 1/2 c  Peeled/chopped yellow onion
2 lg Ripe tomatoes, chopped
2 ts Dried dillweed
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
Juice of lemon
3 lb Boneless lamb shoulder
3 tb Olive oil for pan browning
6 c  Canned / fresh chicken broth
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 c  Orzo paste
1>. In a stove-top Dutch oven brown the boneless lamb shoulder in the

halfway up the side of the meat and simmer, covered, until very
tender, about two hours. 3>. Remove the meat from the pot and set
aside, covered, to keep warm. Remove the fat from the stock in the
pan and add more stock if necessary to make up four cups. Remove the
stock from the pan and set aside. 4>. Heat the Dutch oven again and
add half cup olive oil. Add the orzo paste and toss for a minute. Add
the chopped onion and sautee until the onion is clear. Stir in the
tomatoes, dillweed and parsley. 5>. Return the meat to the pot along
with the 4 cups of stock. Cover and simmer until the broth is
absorbed and the pasta is tender, about 30 minutes. NOTE: if the dish
is toowet when the pasta is tender continue to cook for a few more
minutes with the lid off to reduce the sauce.
