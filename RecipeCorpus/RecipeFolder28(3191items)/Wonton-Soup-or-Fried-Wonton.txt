sesame oil thoroughly in a large mixing bowl.

wrapper.  With a finger dipped in water, moisten 2 adjacent sides and
fold over to make a triangle.  With both hands hold the triangle by
the 2 widest corners and push down so thaat the filled center folds

wontons and return again to a boil.  Serve at once.

FRIED WONTON:  Wontons can also be deep fried in vegetable oil and
eaten as an hors d'oeuvre.
