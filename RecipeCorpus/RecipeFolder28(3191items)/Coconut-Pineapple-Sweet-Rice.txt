Title: Coconut-Pineapple Sweet Rice
Categories: Rice
Yield: 4 cups
1/2 c  Coconut milk
1/2 c  Pineapple, coarsely chopped
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Butter
2 c  Sweet rice
1 sm Butternut squash (3/4 lb)
-peeled, halved, seeded

1. In a bowl, cover rice with 4 cups of water and let soak for 4
hours. Drain well.

2. Line a large bamboo steamer with a double layer of moistened
cheesecloth. Spread the drained rice in a thin layer in the steamer
over plenty of water. Cover and steam over high heat until tender,
about 27 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.

3. Meanwhile, in a small steamer, steam the squash until tender but
still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Add to the rice in the bowl.

4. In a small nonreactive saucepan, combine the coconut milk,
pineapple, sugar, and butter and bring just to a boil over high heat,
stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Stir the pineapple-coconut
milk into the rice and squash and serve hot.
