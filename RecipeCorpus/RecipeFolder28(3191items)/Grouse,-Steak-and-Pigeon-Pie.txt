shallots 2 100 g/4 oz mushrooms
lb 2 hard-boiled eggs 2 fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
200-300 ml/1/3-1/2 pint stock 7/8-1 1/4 cups short pastry, made with
225 g/8 oz (1 1/4 cups) flour beaten egg to glaze A variation of this
dish uses hare and lamb's kidneys. Preheat the oven to
200-C/400-F/Mark 6. Cut the grouse into joints. Slice the steak into
strips. Beat the skinned and boned pigeon breasts and cut each in
half. In a deep pie dish or casserole, make a layer of grouse, then
steak and then pigeon. Scatter over the diced bacon, sliced shallots,
quartered mushrooms, sliced eggs, and salt and pepper to taste.
Repeat the layering until the dish is full. Add enough stock to
three-quarters fill the dish. Cover with the pastry, and make vents
in the lid to allow the steam to escape, glaze with beaten egg and
bake for 20-25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to
180-C/350-F/Mark 4 and bake for a further 1 1/4 hours. Cover the dish
with damp grease-proof or parchment paper or foil, if it is browning
too quickly. This pie can be served either hot or cold.
