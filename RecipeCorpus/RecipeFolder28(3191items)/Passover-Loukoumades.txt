The book is the family recipes of Vivane Miner. Her family (who are
Balkan Sephardic Jews) spent time in Turkey, Greek, Romania and
Bulgaria and this is reflected in their recipes along with the
original Spanish influence. This recipe is a variation of a Greek
dessert.

SYRUP: Bring sugar, water, orange juice and lemon juice to a boil in
a deep saucepan. Cook over low to medium heat until the syrup is
thickened and clear, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in
the spices. Refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours for best results.

LOUKOUMADES: Combine water, oil, sugar and salt in a saucepan and
bring to a boil. Add matzo meal all at one time. Beating all the
while, continue to cook the dough until it pulls away from the sides
of the pot and forms a large ball. Remove from heat and continue
mixing for 5 to 10 minutes to help the dough to cool to lukewarm. Add
eggs one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Drop by
heaping teaspoons into hot oil. They will submerge into the oil and
then rise. Make sure that they fry n both sides and have a uniform
golden color. Dip in syrup and stack on a plate in the shape of a
mountain. Sprinkle with coarsely ground or chopped pistachio nuts.

* may be made with flour other times of the year
