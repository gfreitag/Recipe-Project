Prepare seasoning mix.  Remove skin from the 8 boneless chicken-breast
HALVES.  Cut chicken into bite sized pieces.  Place pieces on a baking
sheet; sprinkle liberally with seasoning.  Let stand at room
temperature 30 minutes.  Place flour in a plastic bag; add seasoned
chicken, shaking to coat all pieces thoroughly.  Remove chicken;
shake in a colander to remove all excess flour, reserving flour. Heat
1 cup lard in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium high heat.
When very hot, add chicken in batches; stir until browned and crisp
on all sides. Remove from heat. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon;
set aside. Loosen any browned bits from the bottom of pan; strain fat
to remove particles. Add enough lard to strained fat to equal 1 cup.
Add fat back to pot over medium-low heat.
Add reserved flour; whisk until a smooth mahogany-colored roux,
about 45 minutes.  Remove from heat; add onion, bell pepper and
celery at once; stir to blend and prevent browning.  Cook until
vegetabloes are wilted and onion is transparent.  *SLOWLY* stir in
stock; stir until combined before adding more.  When all stock has
been added, bring to a full boil. Reduce heat; add sausage, garlic,
salt, black pepper and cayenne. Add browned chicken; simmer 25
minutes, stirring often. Add okra; cook 20 minutes. Remove from heat;
stir in green onions and parsley.  To serve, place 1/2 cup rice in
each soup plate.  Spoon gumbo over rice.  Makes 8 to 10 servings. To
prepare seasoning mix, in a small bowl, combine all ingredients.
