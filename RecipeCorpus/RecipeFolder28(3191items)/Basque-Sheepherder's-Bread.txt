Title: Basque Sheepherder's Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
2 pk ACTIVE DRY YEAST (or 2 scant    1 1/2 tb SALT
1/2 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
9 c  BREAD FLOUR(to 11c), divided
-TBS)
4 1/4 c  WATER (105- to 115-degrees)
Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the water; set aside.

(Makes 1 HUGE round or 4 smaller loaves)

To 4 cups of the water in a very large mixing bowl, add salt, sugar
and 4 cups of the flour. Add the yeast mixture. Add enough flour to
make a workable dough. Knead well, until the dough is soft and silky
feeling, but no longer sticky (soft as a baby's bottom). I add
"sprinkles" of flour towards the end, until it's no longer sticky.

Place dough into a LARGE greased bowl, turning to coat the top. Cover
and place in a warm draft free place to rise until double.

Punch down, knead lightly and form into a round loaf. Place into a
4-1/2-quart Dutch oven.

Cover and place in a warm draft free place to rise until double in
bulk.

Preheat oven to 425-degrees. Place one oven rack at the lowest
position in the oven. If you don't the bread WILL hit the top of the
oven.

Bake for 15 minutes.

Reduce the heat to 350-degrees and continue baking for 50-60 minutes
longer. Of course smaller loaves won't take as long, about 20-30
minutes or so. Loaves will sound hollow when you tap them with your
finger when they're done.

Don't let the pre-baked size of the loaf fool you. The minute it hits
that hot oven it BALLOONS to a HUGE loaf of bread.

Enjoy.
