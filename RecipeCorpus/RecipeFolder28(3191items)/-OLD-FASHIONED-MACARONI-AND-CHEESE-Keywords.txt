"This is more like a macaroni and cheese custard."

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine first 6 ingredients in a bowl;
beat until smooth using a wire whisk.  Layer half of cooked macaroni
in bottom of a greased 9" square baking dish; sprinkle with 1 2/3
cups cheese and layer remaining macaroni on top.  Pour milk mixture
over macaroni; sprinkle with breadcrumbs.  Bake, uncovered, for 50
minutes; sprinkle with remaining cheese and continue baking 5 minutes
longer, or until set.
