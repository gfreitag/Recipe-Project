Title: Wisconsin Fondue Deluxe
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Dry white wine
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1/8 ts Ground red pepper
1    8-oz box bread sticks
Assorted vegetables*
1    1-oz round loaf crusty white
-bread; optional
3 c  Shredded Raclette cheese
3 c  Shredded Rofumo or Fontina
-cheese
3 tb All-purpose flour
*Such as radishes, broccoli florets, zucchini and yellow squash
strips, red, green and yellow bell pepper cubes, mushroom caps, etc.

NOTE:  Slice a 1-inch "lid" off the top of the bread; cut into 1
1/2-inch cubes.  Carefully hollow out loaf so that interior can be
cut into similar cubes.  Place cubes in a shallow pan; and set aside
to harden.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine cheese and flour; set aside.  In
a deep heavy saucepan heat wine over medium heat until the wine
begins to simmer. Add the cheese in several batches, stirring
constantly (reduce heat if mixture begins to boil).  Stir in nutmeg
and pepper. Cook about 10 minutes longer, or until fondue is thick
and creamy.

Place bread on a large serving tray.  Surround with reserved bread
cubes, bread sticks, and vegetables.  Pour cheese into bread or your
favorite fondue pot, and serve.
