Vegetables should be washed and sliced, flowers and fruit stripped off
their stems, herbs left on the branch.  It is difficult to be specific
about the proportion of ingredients to vinegar.  With the fruit,
flowers and vegetables--about half and half.  With the herbs and
spices--one tablespoon or three sprigs per pint.

The authors write that the fruit, vegetable and herb vinegars can be
used in salads, soups, sauces and stews and note that the fruit
vinegars are good for deglazing a pan after cooking meat, game or
poultry.

The basic principle is to steep the flavoring ingredient in white
wine or cider vinegar in a large glass jar or crock.  DO NOT USE MALT
VINEGAR OR UNBREWED CONDIMENT.  It will take at least a few weeks.
After that keep sampling until the flavor is fully developed. Leaving
the jar in strong sunlight will help to draw it out.  Then strain and
decant into individual bottles.  Cap firmly and label.
