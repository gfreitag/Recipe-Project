Title: Tabouli (Bulgur Wheat Salad)
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
cn Diced tomatoes
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1/4 t  Black epper
x  Salt
1 c  Whole wheat bulgur
1 lg Onion chopped
x  Boiling water
1 lb Tomatoes, chopped or 1*16*oz
Put 1 cup of whole wheat bulgur and 1 large chopped onion in a medium
Pyrex bowl and cover with boiling water...let these soak 2 hours (if
you like the bite of raw onion, you can add the onion later...I like
it better slightly cooked by the water).  Drain well and add 1 lb of
fresh chopped tomatoes or one 16 oz can of diced tomatoes, 1/3 cup
lemon juice (freshly squeezed tastes much better than from
concentrate), 1/4 tsp or more freshly ground black pepper, and salt
to taste. Let it stand for several hours or overnight in the
refrigerator to mix the flavors. Pritikin also suggested adding fresh
mint leaves, chopped, but I've never had any to try! This is great in
ww pita pockets!

Enjoy...and let me know if you make any yummy variations!
