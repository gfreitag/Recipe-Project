Title: Lime Curd
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 batch
2 oz Unsalted butter
2    Eggs
4    Limes
5 oz Sugar
Wash and dry the limes.  Finely grate the rinds, squeeze and reserve
the juice.  Put the rind, sugar and butter into a small, heavy
saucepan, beat the eggs and strain into the mixture.  Stir over a low
heat until the butter is melted and the sugar dissolved.  Add the
juice, raise the heat slightly and continue stirring until the curd
has thickened enough to coat thickly the back of the spoon.  If you
are worried about curdling, use an asbestos mat or a double boiler
but it will take longer. Pour into warm, dry jars, cover with waxed
discs and cellophane or screw-on lids. Refrigerate.  It will keep for
up to 2 months.

Use Lime Curd in cake and tart fillings, meringue pies or on hot
muffins or scones with thick cream.

The authors warn that if you want to make more than 1 batch then you
should plan on making 2 or 3 batches instead of doubling the recipe,
otherwise it will take forever for the Lime Curd to thicken.
