Categories: Diabetic, Desserts

1 1/2 T  Fruit sweetener

1/4 c  Walnuts
2 c  Rolled oats

1 T  Water
1 T  Fruit sweetener
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the walnuts in the preheated
oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool,
then place them in a food processor, using the pulsing action, until
they are finely ground. Use an electric mixer to combine all the
crust ingredients until the oats soften enough for the mixture to
hold itself together when squeezed in your hand. Press the dough into
a pie tin, forming a rounded edge. Bake the crust in the preheated
oven for 20 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven. In a small bowl
combine the fruit sweetener and water for the glaze, and brush on the
hot crust.Return the crust to the oven and bake for another 10 to 15
minutes until the crust is evenly browned. Let the crust cool before
filling. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   03-11-95
