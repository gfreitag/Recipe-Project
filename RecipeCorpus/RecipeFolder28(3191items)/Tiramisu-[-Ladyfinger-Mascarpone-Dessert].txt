Beat egg whites until stiff peaks are formed.

thick and pale yellow.  Fold in mascarpone until thoroughly
incorporate and smooth. Fold in beaten egg whites in the same way.

Combine espresso and brandy in a medium size bowl.  Dip each
ladyfinger in the mixture quickly and singly; do not soak.  Place a
layer of moistened ladyfingers in the bottom of a 14x10-in dish.
Spread half the mascarpone mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.
Sprinkle half the cocoa through a strainer over the mascarpone in an
even layer. Dip the rest of the ladyfingers in the espresso-brandy
mixture and make another layer. Spread the remaining mascarpone over
the ladyfingers. Sprinkle rest of cocoa over it.  Cover dish with
plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours. Just before serving,
shave chocolate with peeler and sprinkle over cake.
