until they float (about four to five minutes).  Drain and discard
liquid. If made ahead, cool, cover, and refrigerate up to two days.

Soup - Cover bean threads with warm water and let stand for 30
minutes. Drain, then place on a cutting board and cut in 6" lengths.
In a 2-quart pan heat chicken broth, sherry and soy just to boiling.
Add bean threads and mushrooms and simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes.
Add snow peas and cook for two minutes.  Add shrimp balls and cook
just until heated through. Garnish with cilantro and season to taste
with salt.
