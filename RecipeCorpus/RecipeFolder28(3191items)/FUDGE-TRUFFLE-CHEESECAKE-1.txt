Make the chocolate crust:
Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325
F.
Remove the sides from a 10-by-3-inch springform pan. Trim a
10-inch
cardboard cake circle so that it fits snugly within the curved
lip of
the bottom of the springform pan. Cover the circle with a piece of
heavy-duty aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang all around the
edges

Carefully attach the side of the pan so you do not tear the foil.
Wrap
the foil overhang halfway up the outside of the pan. (Lining the
bottom
of the pan in this way will give the cheesecake an even flat base,
making it easy to remove from the pan.)

In a small bowl, stir together the cookie crumbs and melted
butter,
stirring until well combined. Press the mixture evenly over the
bottom
of the prepared pan. Refrigerate the crust while you prepare the
ganache
and filling.

Make the ganache:
Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan set over
medium heat, bring the cream to a gentle boil. Pour the hot cream
over
the chocolate and allow the mixture to stand for 30 seconds to
melt the
chocolate. Whisk until smooth. Measure out 2 cups of the ganache
for the
cake filling and set aside. Measure out 1 cup of the ganache for
the
chocolate truffles, cover and refrigerate until firm enough to
pipe.
Cover the remaining ganache and set aside at room temperature.

Make the filling:
Place the cornstarch in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in the
cream and
the vanilla, and whisk until smooth.
