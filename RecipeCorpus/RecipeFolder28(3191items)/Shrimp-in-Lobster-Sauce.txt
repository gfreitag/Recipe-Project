SHRIMP IN CHINESE LOBSTER SAUCE

INSTRUCTIONS:

Shell and de-vein the shrimp. Butterfly shrimp by slicing them down
the length of the back, stopping just above the tail. Rinse with cold
water and blot dry.

Cover the black beans with lukewarm water; let soak for 5 minutes.
Drain. Combine with the minced garlic and ginger; gently crush into a
paste. Mix in the wine; set aside.

Place a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, drizzle in half of the
oil. Add the shrimp and stir-fry until they begin to curl and turn
bright orange, about 1 minute. Remove to a dish and keep warm.

Reheat wok over medium heat; add remaining tablespoon of oil and the
salt. Add the black bean paste and saute a few seconds until it
becomes aromatic. Increase heat to medium-high. Add the pork and
stir-fry until the morsels are no longer pink, about 3 minutes.

Add onions, peppers, sugar, white pepper and soy sauce; toss together
until the vegetables begin to soften, about 1 minute. Add the stock
and keep tossing until it comes to a boil.

Stir the cornstarch mixture to recombine, then drizzle into the
center of the work, stirring constantly, until mixt--- TBBS v2.1/NM !
