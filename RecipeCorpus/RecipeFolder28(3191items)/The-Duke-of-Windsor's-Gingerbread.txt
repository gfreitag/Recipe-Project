Title: The Duke of Windsor's Gingerbread
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 2 loaves
1 ts Ground caraway seeds
2 oz Chopped mixed peel
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1/4 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1 lb Black treacle
3    Eggs
1/2 lb Butter or margarine;
-softened
1 lb Plain flour
4 oz Dark brown or Barbados sugar
1 oz Ground ginger
1/2 lb Blanched, chopped almonds
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Rub the butter into the flour until it
looks like coarse meal.  Stir in the sugar, ginger, almonds, spices,
the peel and the bicarbonate of soda until well blended.  Beat the
eggs with the treacle and stir into the dry ingredients.  Pour into 2
buttered and floured loaf tins and bake in the oven for approximately
35-40 minutes or until the cakes are risen and *just* shrinking from
the sides of the pan. Turn out onto racks and cool.  Wrap in
greaseproof paper and then in foil.

The authors adapted this recipe from "Court Favorites" by Elizabeth
Craig (1953).  They say that this was a favorite of the Duke and made
for him in the palace kitchens when he was a child.  The authors like
this served warm, cut into thick slices, with "lashings" of butter.
