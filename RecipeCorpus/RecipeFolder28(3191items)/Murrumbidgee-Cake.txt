Title: Murrumbidgee Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 cake
3 oz Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking powder
5 oz Sugar
3    Egss; beaten
1 ts Vanilla
Spirit
7 oz Whole brazil nuts
5 oz Walnuts
1/2 lb Stoned dates
3 oz Candied peel; chopped
6 oz Glace cherries (several
-colors if possible)
3 oz Seedless raisins
Grated rind of 1 lemon
Preheat the oven to 300F.  Line a loaf or square baking tin with
greased paper.  Put nuts and fruit into a large bowl.  Sift the
flour, salt and baking powder together, and add to the fruit mixture
with the sugar. Mix well and make into a stiff batter with the eggs
and vanilla. Place in the tin, flatten down with the back of a spoon
and bake for 1 1/2-2 hours. Test for doneness with a knife or skewer
(if the top is browning too quickly cover with foil).  Leave to cool
in the tin for 10 minutes before turning out.  Place in the middle of
a clean tea towel, pierce in several places and soak with
spirit--brandy, rum or whatever you have--then wrap the towel around
the cake and store in plastic wrap or foil. Keep in the refrigerator.
Top up the spirit every week for 1-2 months.

The authors aren't sure, but they think that this recipe is
originally from Australia.
