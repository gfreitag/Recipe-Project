"When the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture brought out its new food guide
pyramid, at least one group felt left out: vegetarians. A nutrition
expert from New York Medical College has now remedied the problem.

"Arlene Spark, Ph.D., clinical assc. prof. of nutrition, developed a
pyramid that helps nonmeat eaters build a healthful diet. Her pyramid
matches the USDA version in overall organization, but it offers
substitutes for the meat/fish group and for the dairy group. In
addition, the veg. pyramid includes special recommendations for
vegans....These recommendations ensure that vegans obtain all needed
nutrients."

Top portion of pyramid: "Vegans Must Consume Daily" veg. oil (3-5
tsp) and Blackstrap molasses (1 tbs.) and Brewer's yeast (1 tbs.)

2nd portion: "Milk and Milk Substitutes Group" milk, yogurt, cheese
and fortified soy milk (with added calcium, vitamins B12 and D) (2-4
servings)

"Meat/Fish Substitutes Group" dry beans, nuts, seeds, peanut butter,
tofu, and eggs (2-3 servings)

3rd portion:  "Vegetable Group" 3+ servings

"Fruit Group" 2-4 servings

4th portion (bottom of pyramid): "Grains and Starchy Vegetables Group"
bread, cereal, rice, pasta, corn, potatoes, and green peas (6-11
servings)
