It was an accident! But now Caesar Salad is tossed in handsome salad
bowls, coast to coast- and on purpose! A well-known restaurateur,
Caesar Cardini, concocted this zesty salad some 35 years ago at
Tijuana, Mexico.

Here is the true story, told to us by his daughter Rosa. One holiday
weekend a throng of tourists descended on Caesar's Place. A few
crates of romaine, half a case of eggs, a wheel of Italian cheese,
some lemons, and dry bread- that was all the food left by Sunday
morning. What to do for the hungry crowd at dinner? Caesar thought
he'd have to close shop for the remainder of the holiday. Instead he
decided to invent a new salad from the few and rather odd combination
of ingredients he had on hand. He got out the eggs, the lemons, the
Parmesan cheese, the bread, and the big bottle of olive oil [turn to
page 152] (rest of story missing!)

The recipe:

1. Over torn romaine (3 heads for 6 servings), zig-zag a stream of
olive oil- about 1/3 cup. Repeat with 3 tablespoons vinegar. Squeeze
in 1 lemon.

2. With a flourish, break 1 or 2 coddled eggs (cooked 1 to 1 1/2
minutes) atop salad greens. In Caesar Cardini's words, "Make a
production of it!"

3. Give your pepper mill several generous twists- fresh-ground pepper
makes a snappy difference. Shake in some salt, a splash of
Worcestershire.

4. In goes grated Parmesan cheese. Roll-toss salad. When every leaf
glistens, add a handful of Caesar Croutons; toss again. Anchovy
topper, anyone?
