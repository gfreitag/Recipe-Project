Categories: Fish, Main dish, Irish
Yield: 2 servings
4 ea Red crabs, live, fresh
2 tb Salt
2 tb Apple cider
MMMMM----------------------------DIP---------------------------------
2 ts Black pepper, fresh ground
2 ts Lemon juice
1/2 c  Butter
2 cl Garlic, finely chopped
Heat a large pot of water to boiling and add the salt and cider.
Plunge the crabs into the boiling water and replace the lid. Boil the
crabs for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size. Take them out and
allow to cool. Dismember, crack and remove meat. Cut away the soft
"apron" on the underside of the shell.  Discard the sac at the head
and the ruffle around the edge.  Scrape out the rest of the meat with
a sharp knife. To make the dip, melt the butter in a small pan, add
the garlic and fry for 3 minutes, but do not brown. Turn off the
heat, stir in the black pepper and lemon juice. Serve the crab meat
in bowls, with brown bread and the dip on the side.
