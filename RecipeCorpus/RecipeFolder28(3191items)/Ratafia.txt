Title: Ratafia
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 lb Sugar
1/4 lb Whole coriander seeds
3    Oranges
20    -fluid ounces brandy
Peel the clean, dry oranges.  Use only the orange part of the peel
and chop finely.  Squeeze the oranges and put the juice and rind into
a large glass jar.  Add the brandy, sugar and coriander seeds and
stir. Leave it in a cool, dark place for 2 months and then strain and
bottle. These delicate liqueurs should always be stored away from
heat and light.

The authors explain that ratafias are sweet liqueurs that are made
with fruit, spices, herbs or blossoms that are marinated in brandy or
brandy and wine.  The ratafias can be individualized and the authors
suggest trying quinces, sour cherries, oranges, peaches or apricots
(with their cracked stones), or lavender flowers steeped in white
wine.

Johnston.
