Title: Chicken And Egg Noodles
Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Pasta
Yield: 3 servings
MMMMM------------------------EGG NOODLES-----------------------------
1 1/2 c  Flour (about)
2 ea Eggs, beaten
MMMMM----------------------------SOUP---------------------------------
1 c  Carrot, chopped
1 tb Parsley, dried
1 ts Rosemary, crushed
1 tb Season salt
2 qt Water
6 tb Chicken gravy mix
1 c  Chicken, chunked
1 c  Onion, diced
1 c  Celery, diced
Combine eggs and flour.  Add additional flour if needed to make stiff,
smooth dough.  Roll out and cut into strips, set aside to dry. Note:
General rule of thumb; 1 egg per person plus as much flour as can be
worked into it.

Combine rest of ingredients in slow cooker and cook on low 5-6 hours
or until vegetables are tender.

Add noodles to soup and cook additional 3-4 hours or until noodles are
tender.

Notes: When I have it, I substitute home made chicken stock for the
water and chicken gravy mix. Also, sometimes just use chicken bullion
cubes instead of the gravy mix.

Also can be cooked on the stovetop but watch carefully it doesn't
stick as the noodles will soak up a lot of broth.
