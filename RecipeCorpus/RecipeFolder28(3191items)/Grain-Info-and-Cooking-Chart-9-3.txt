Risotto
Yield: 1 info

A perfect risotto requires patience. The principle of the method is
to have the rice absorb the stock a little at a time, until the
grains swell and a creamy tender union is formed between the rice and
the stock.

The Never-Nevers of Risotto

* Never rinse the rice before cooking. The essential ingredients for a
creamy risotto is the starch coat of the grain. * Never use a
lightweight pot. Use a heavy pot with a flat bottom and straight
sides to ensure even cooking. * Never let the cooking stock get cold.
Keep it simmering in a separate pot and make sure it's a good,
flavorful, preferably homemade stock. * Never cook risotto too slowly
or the texture will be gluey rather than creamy. * Never cook risotto
too quickly or the outside will be soft and the inside too firm.
Start bite-testing the grains for doneness after about 15 minutes of
cooking.

Pilafs

Unlike risotto, pilaf is always prepared with long grain rice and the
cooking methods differ considerably. In making pilaf, the long grain
rice is tossed and toasted in butter until it is completely coated
and begins to color. Then boiling stock is added, the pot is covered
tightly and the rice steamed either on top of the stove or in the
oven until all the liquid is absorbed. This allows the grains to
become separate and fluffy, but still retain their texture.
