Title: Cajun Rosemary Digestif
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
1    Sprig rosemary
6    Raisins
1    Bottle Spanish brandy
Peel of 1 orange
1 ts Fennel seeds
Place the peel, seeds, rosemary and raisins into the brandy bottle.
Cap and leave to steep for at least a month before drinking or giving
to greedy friends.  It improves tremendously with age.

The authors say that this is an antidote for over-indulgence that they
adapted from an old Louisiana cookbook.
