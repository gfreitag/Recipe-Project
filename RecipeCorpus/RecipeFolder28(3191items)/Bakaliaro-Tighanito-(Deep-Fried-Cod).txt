Title: Bakaliaro Tighanito (Deep-Fried Cod)
Categories: Middle east, Fish
Yield: 4 servings
Vegetable oil; or shortening
;for deep-frying
Skordalia; (garlic/potato
;sauce) or 2 lemons, each
;cut lengthwise into 6 or 8
;wedges
2 1/2 lb Salt cod
3 c  Flour
2 c  Water; lukewarm 110 to 115
;degrees (F)
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
Starting a day ahead of time, place the cod in a glass, enameled or
stainless steel pan or bowl, cover it with cold water and soak for at
least 12 hours, changing the water 3 or 4 times.  Drain the cod,
rinse under cold running water, and cut into pieces about 2 inches
long and 1 inch wide.
An hour or so before you plan to serve the cod, make the batter. In
a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour, the warm water,
baking soda and salt and, with a large spoon, mix to a fairly smooth
cream but do not over beat.  Then let the batter rest for about 1
hour at room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees (F).  Line a large baking dish or
pan with paper towels and set it aside.  In a deep fryer, heat 3 to 4
inches of oil or shortening until it reaches a temperature of 375 on
a deep frying thermometer.
Pat the fish completely dry with paper towels.  Dip the pieces, one
at a time, into the remaining cup of flour and shake vigorously to
remove any excess.  Six or 7 pieces at a time, drop the fish into the
batter, and when thoroughly coated, lift them out with tongs and deep
fry them for 5 or 6 minutes, turning them over frequently until they
are golden brown. Transfer them to the lined dish and keep them warm
in the oven while you fry the remaining fish.  Serve hot, accompanied
by skordalia or garnished with lemon wedges.
