These shrimp can be served with cocktails, as a first course or as a
lunch dish. Choose the largest shrimp you can find and dip into beer
batter.

Cut the shrimp down the back but keep the tail shell attached.
Sprinkle with lemon juice, dip into flour and then into beer batter.
Allow the excess batter to drain off, and deep-fry shrimp until
golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes at 375 degrees. Drain and
serve immediately, garnished with parsley and lemon wedges. From the
