Comments on pickling:

The above recipe will cure up to 100 lbs. of meat. Ready made
pickling mixes are available with directions on pkg.

The salinometer reading should be abt. 60 degrees.

Quantity of pickling spices may be increased if a spicier flavor is
desired.  Also:

Prepare spiced by boiling them slowly in half a pint of water.

Keep meat completely submerged in this solution for a time
depending on the size of the pieces--from 10 days if the pcs. weigh
abt. 2-4 lb. each, up to 16 da. if they weigh 7-8 lb.

Overhaul every 3rd. day.

Inspect daily.  If the pickle is kept at 35 F. there should be
little risk of deterioration.  But if the brine begins to change
color noticeably, and to smell sour, pour it away at one, wash the
meat in clean water, wash out the crock and sterilize it with boiling
water. The make a fresh batch of brine.

Many tough cuts of meat can be made tender and palatable by
curing--for example, brisket, bear, elk, venison, moose, etc., tht is
too tough to cook by ordinary methods can be turned into a real
delicacy by sweet pickle curing.
