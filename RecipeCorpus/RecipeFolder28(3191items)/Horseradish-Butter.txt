The Int'l Horseradish Festival is held in Collinsville, IL (about 10
miles east of St. Louis, MO) every May. Sixy percent of the worlds
horseradish is grown there. It's pretty easy to grow. Why is it Hot?
Highly volatile oils are released by enzyme activity when the root
cells are crushed. To grind: Wash & peel dice in small cubes. Process
in a blender with enough cold water to just cover.  Add 2-3 T. white
vinegar ane 1/2 t. salt. Process no more than half a blender jar. The
time you add the vinegar is critical as this determines how hot it
will be. If you like it hot wait up to 3 minutes to add the vinegar
as this stops the emzymatic action.
