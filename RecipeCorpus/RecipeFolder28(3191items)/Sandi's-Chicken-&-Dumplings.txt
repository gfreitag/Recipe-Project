Title: Sandi's Chicken & Dumplings
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Side dish
Yield: 8 servings
DUMPLINGS
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth, cooled
4 c  Flour
2 t  Baking Powder
1 1/2 t  Salt
1/4 t  Pepper
4 lb Chicken pieces
Water, to cover
6 ea Chicken Bouillon Cubes
Salt & Pepper, to taste
Chopped onion, optional
Carrots, sliced, optional
Celery, sliced, optional
Boil chicken, bouillon cubes, and salt and pepper until chicken
is done (add veggies during last 30 minutes of cooking).
Dip 1 1/2 cups broth out to cool.  Remove chicken.  When cool
enough to handle, tear into bite size chunks.
Prepare dumplings.  Mix dry ingredients together.  Gradually add
broth, stirring to mix to a stiff dough.  Put dough on floured pastry
cloth and roll 1/8 inch (or less) thick.  Cut into 3" x 1" strips.
Bring broth in pot to a boil.  Add chicken pieces.  Put dumplings,
one at a time, into boiling broth.  Cover, reduce heat, and boil
20-25 minutes until tender. Stir occasionally.
Check doneness by cutting a dumpling in half.  If it's dark in the
center, it's not done yet.
To thicken the broth, mix together some cornstarch and water and
add it a little at a time, stirring constantly, until desired
consistency is reached.
This recipe will serve about 8 people when served with a salad,
and bread & butter.
