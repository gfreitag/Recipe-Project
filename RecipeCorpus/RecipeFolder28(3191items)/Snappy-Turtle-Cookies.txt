baking soda and salt; mix well.  Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate
about 1 hour for easier handling.

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease cookie sheets.  Arrange pecan
pieces in groups of 5 on greased cookie sheets to resemble head and
legs of turtle. In small bowl, beat egg white.  Shape dough into one
inch balls.  Dip bottoms in beaten egg white; press lightly onto
pecans (tips of pecans should still show).

Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are light
golden brown.  Immediately remove from cookies sheets.  Cool
completely.

In small saucepan, combine chocolate chips, milk and 1 T butter; cook
over low heat, stirring constantly until melted and smooth.  Remove
from heat; stir in powdered sugar.  Add additional powdered sugar if
necessary for desired spreading consistency.  Frost cooled cookies.
Allow frosting to set before storing.  Store in airtight container.
