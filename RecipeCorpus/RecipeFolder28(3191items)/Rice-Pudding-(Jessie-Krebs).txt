This is Jim's mother's recipe for rice pudding. It's a bit different
because of the meringue on top. It's delicious! 2 qt boiling water 1
cup rice (heaping) 1 qt milk 1 cup sugar 4 eggs, separated Add rice
to boiling water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Drain rice. Return
rice to pan and add 1 qt milk. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered,
for 20 minutes. (Stir occasionally.) Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar
well, then stir into rice mixture. Cook over medium heat for 15
minutes. (Stir occasionally.) Preheat oven to 350-F. Beat egg whites
until frothy, then gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue
beating until stiff peaks form. Brown on rack in center of oven for
15 to 20 minutes. (Meringue should be lightly browned.)
