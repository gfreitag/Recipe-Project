Categories: Dips/spread, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
4    -fluid ounces port or rum
2 1/4 lb Sugar
Almond oil
3 lb Blackcurrants; picked over

Place the fruit, water and 2 oz of the spirit into a wide, heavy pan.
Cook over a medium heat until the fruit is soft and pulpy.  Add the
sugar and stir over a low heat to dissolve.  Bring to the boil and
continue boiling gently until it is thick and almost solid, being
careful not to let it burn.  This can take an hour or three.  Add the
remaining spirit and stir. Decant into straight-sided glass jars or

Cover with waxed discs and cellophane.  Keep for 2-6 months before
using. Turn out whole and serve in slices, or melt to use as a sweet
sauce.
