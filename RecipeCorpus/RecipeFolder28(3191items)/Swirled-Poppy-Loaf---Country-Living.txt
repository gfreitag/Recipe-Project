MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
-cut into 4 slices
1 lg Egg white
3 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/4 t  Salt
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (105' to 115'F)
2 T  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Skim milk
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) unsalted butter,
MMMMM-------------------------EGG GLAZE------------------------------
Confectioners' sugar (opt.)
1 lg Egg yolk
2 t  Water
1. Prepare Filling: In 2-quart saucepan, heat poppy seeds and milk to
boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly. Continue to cook,
stirring until thick and all milk is absorbed-about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in brown sugar, prunes, walnuts, honey, and
cinnamon. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

2. Meanwhile, prepare Dough: In large bowl, sprinkle yeast over
water. Stir in granulated sugar and let mixture stand until
foamy-about 5 minutes.

3. In 1-quart saucepan, heat milk just until bubbles appear around
side of pan. Remove from heat. Add butter and cool milk mixture to
110' to 115'F.

4. With wooden spoon, beat egg white and milk mixture into yeast
mixture. Stir in 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 C flour and the salt until soft,
manageable dough forms.

5. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead, adding
remaining flour as necessary, until dough is smooth and elastic-about
8 to 10 minutes.

6. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in sizeabout 1
hour,

7. Prepare Egg Glaze: In cup, combine egg yolk and water until well
blended.

8. Punch down dough and let rest 5 minutes. On floured sheet of
parchment paper or heavy-duty aluminum foil, with floured rolling
pin, roll out dough to a 16 by 14-inch rectangle. Brush surface with
some glaze. Spread filling evenly over rolled dough, leaving an
uncovered 1/4 inch border around rectangle.

9. Starting with a 16-inch edge, roll dough up. (Do not press the
ends to seal.) Place roll, still on the paper, on baking sheet. If
necessary, gently turn the roll so that seam side faces down and
place diagonally across baking sheet. Let rise in warm place, away
from drafts, 20 minutes.

10. Heat oven to 350'F. Beginning about 3 inches from one end, make 4
diagonal cuts, about 2 1/3 inches apart and 1/4 inch deep, across top
of loaf. If desired, with tip of knife, score decorative swirls in a
border on top of loaf. Brush loaf with some glaze and bake 30 minutes.

11. Brush loaf again with remaining glaze. Bake 5 minutes more or
until loaf sounds hollow when lightly tapped. (During baking, the
filling may ooze out and crack the dough along a long side. After
cooling, press the crack together to reseal.) Cool loaf on wire rack
to room temperature. Transfer to cutting board and sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar, if desired.

Note: You can grind whole poppy seeds using a small food processor,
grain grinder, or coffee mill.
