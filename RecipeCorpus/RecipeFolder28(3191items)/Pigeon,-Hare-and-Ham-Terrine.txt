METRIC/IMPERIAL
1 hare
1 the breasts of 2 pigeons
2/3 cup
1/4 cup

2
150 ml/1/4 pint dry white wine
60 ml/4 tbsp Cognac
4 juniper berries
2 shallots
oil for frying
1/4 lb
1 tsp
100 g/4 oz pork fat
5 ml/1 tsp dried thyme
1 egg
1 fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 350-450 g/3/4- 1 lb
tissue-thin
slices of pork fat or unsmoked streaky (fatty) bacon 3/4- 1 lb 225
g/8 oz good quality cooked ham, in 2.5 cm/1 inch cubes 1/2 lb aspic
powder or powdered (unflavoured) gelatine, to thicken gherkins and
bay leaf, to garnish Remove all the meat from the hare and place it
together with the skinned, boned and lightly beaten pigeon breasts in
a bowl. Add the wine, and Cognac and crushed juniper berries and
leave to marinate in a cool place overnight or for 48 hours if
possible. Turn the meat frequently. Drain the meat and pat dry.
Strain the marinade and reserve the liquid. Preheat the oven to
190-C/375-F/Mark 5. Slice the shallots and saute them lightly in oil.
Reserve 5-6 large pieces of hare, and the pigeon breasts and cut into
strips. Mince (grind) the rest of the hare meat, the shallots and
pork fat. Add the thyme, marinade, beaten egg and salt and pepper to
taste, and mix well. Line a terrine dish with the thin pork fat or
bacon. Stretching the fat thin can be done easily by holding it down
on a board, and running the back of a carving knife across it. Spread
the minced (ground) mixture on the bottom of the terrine, then place
strips of marinated hare, pigeon and ham on top. Continue adding
layers of the minced (ground) mixture and hare, pigeon and cubes of
ham. Make sure that the last layer is the minced (ground) mixture.
Cover with a layer of fat and the lid. Cook in a bain marie (a
roasting pan with 5 cm/2 inches of water will work just as well) for
1 1/4-1 1/2 hours. When cooked, the terrine will have shrunk from the
sides of the dish. Pierce the terrine with a skewer: if there is no
trace of blood and the juices run clear the terrine is done. Remove
the lid, place a weight on top and cool, preferably overnight, before
serving. Sometimes we pour off the juices, thicken them with a little
aspic powder or gelatine and pour them back over the terrine before
cooling. The flavour of the terrine improves if kept for 3-4 days
before serving. Before serving, remove the top layer of fat and
decorate with gherkins and a bay leaf.
