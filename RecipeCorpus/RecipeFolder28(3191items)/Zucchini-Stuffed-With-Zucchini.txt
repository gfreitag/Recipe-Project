1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Trim ends from zucchini, but leave whole.
Cook zucchini in a large saucepan of boiling salted water 3 mins;
drain and rinse under cold running water. Cut zucchini in half
lengthwise. Scoop out centers to form a trench down the middle of
each half. Chop zucchini centers and place in a medium bowl.

2. In a medium frying pan, heat 2 Tbs olive oil over medium heat. Add
onion and cook 2 to 3 mins, or until softened. Stir in prosciutto or
ham, chopped zucchini, bread crumbs, and parsley. Cook, stirring once
or twice, 2 mins. Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan
cheese, egg, salt, and nutmeg.

3. Stuff zucchini with bread crumb mixture. Place zucchini in a
flameproof baking dish just large enough to hold them. Drizzle
remaining 1 Tbs olive oil over zucchini and sprinkle with remaining
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

4. Bake 20 mins, or until heated through. Transfer to the broiler and
broil 3 inches from heat until golden brown on top, 1 to 2 mins.

SERVES 6 to 12.
