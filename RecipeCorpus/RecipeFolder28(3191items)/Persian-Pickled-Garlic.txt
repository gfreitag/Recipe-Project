The authors mention that this is "a nice addition to a robust plate of
mixed hors d'oeuvre or with other pickles and cold cuts, or served
with salted nuts, cheese and strong drink--provided the food to
follow os powerul enough to stand up to the pungent taste of garlic."
They also say that the woman from whom they got this recipe notes
that the batch of pickled garlic will be fine after 2 weeks, but that
in her family part of each batch is laid down for future use.
