Title: Baked beans-1
Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Paprika/chile powder
1    Onion, diced
2 c  Dried navy beans
1/2 lb Salt pork/bacon/ham, diced
1/2 c  Molasses/brown sugar
1/2 c  Tomato sauce/ketchup
In a large pot, soak the beans overnight. Drain and add fresh water to
cover. Simmer for 60 minutes.  Drain in a colander. In an oven proof
dish combine beans and the other ingredients. Bake the beans,
covered, in a 300 deg F oven for 5 hours, adding water as necessary
to keep the beans just barely covered. Remove lid and cook uncovered
for 1 more hour.

This recipe is spicier than the classic Boston baked beans but tasty.

Variations: Substitute sliced sausages and 1/2 tsp salt for salt pork.
Add to taste: thyme or sage

cayenne or black pepper
garlic,minced/powder
