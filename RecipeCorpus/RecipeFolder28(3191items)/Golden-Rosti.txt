potatoes 1 1/2 lb 100 g/4 oz butter, plus a little oil
stick fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper This is one of
the great dishes of Switzerland, and although there are many cantonal
variations the simplest is the best. Partly boil the potatoes. Drain
and leave to cool. About 45 minutes before you wish to serve, heat
half of the butter or oil in a frying pan. (Add a little oil if to
stop the butter from burning.) Roughly grate the potatoes and spread
them over the bottom of the pan. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Cook for about 20 minutes. Take from the heat and put a plate
face down on top of the potatoes. Turn the pan over so that the
potatoes rest like a cake on to plate. (The Swiss have special twin
frying pans which hook together to make this inversion simpler.) Add
the rest of the butter to the pan and slide the rosti back into it,
uncooked side down. Add more salt and pepper and cook for a further
25 minutes or until the potato cake is golden brown and crisp on the
outside and still slightly moist on the inside. A variation is to add
125 g/4 oz of crisp diced bacon. Another is to add partly cooked
chopped onions and bacon and 5 ml/1 tsp of cumin seeds.
