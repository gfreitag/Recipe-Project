Title: Paneer
Categories: Indian
Yield: 5 ounces
2 tb Lemon juice
5 c  Gold top milk
Bring the milk to a boil. Add the lemon juice so that the milk
separates into curds and whey. Add a little more if necessary to
achieve this. Leave to set for 5 minutes.

Line a strainer with cheesecloth and strain the milk. Reserve the
whey to use in curries instead of water to add extra flavor and
minerals. Squeeze the excess whey out of the curd and fold the cloth
around the paneer to form a 4-inch square. Place the paneer on an
upturned plate and place a heavy weight on top to squeeze out the
excess whey. Leave for about 4 hours to set.

Note: I don't know the US equivalent of gold top milk.
