Title: Ginger and Orange Turkish Delight
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 batch
1 oz Finely pounded* crystallized
-orange peel
1    -squeeze lemon juice
1/2 lb Icing sugar (approx.)
2 1/2 oz Gelatine
20    -fluid ounces water
1 1/2 lb Sugar
1 tb *fresh* ginger (it must be
-fresh)
Put the gelatine in a saucepan with the water and dissolve it over a
low heat, stirring constantly.  Add the sugar and stir until melted.
Add the ginger and orange peel, continue stirring and boil briskly
for 10-15 minutes.  The syrup should be clear and aromatic.  Remove
from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and pour into a wet tin.  An
8-inch square one is about right.  Leave for 24 hours to set.  Then
turn out onto a board heavily dusted with icing sugar, sift more
sugar over the top and cut into chunks with a very sharp knife.  Roll
the pieces in lots of icing sugar and then pack into air-tight tins
with a generous amount of icing sugar.

CINNAMON AND ROSE TURKISH DELIGHT:  Follow the recipe but substitute 1
heaped tablespoon of fresh, strong cinnamon for the ginger and orange
peel, and use 1 teaspoon of rose water and a few drops of cochineal
coloring in place of the lemon juice.
