triple chocolate cookies says it all- or almost. Serve them only to
guests who you don't want to have leave- ever!"

1. Preheat the oven to 375F. 2. Place 1 1/4 cups of the oats in the
container of a food processor, and process until fine, 1 minute. 3.
Beat the butter with both sugars in the large bowl of an electric
mixer until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. 4. Combine the
processed oats with the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Slowly add to the butter mixture. Then stir in the remaining 1/4 cup
oats, the chocolates, and the almonds. 5. Drop the dough by spoonfuls
onto the ungreased baking sheets, and bake until golden brown, about
10 minutes. Cool slightly on the sheets before removing. Makes about.
