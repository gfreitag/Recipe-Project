Title: Mike's Prize Winning Salsa**
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 pints
(Note 3)
2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Vinegar
1/3 c  Fresh cilantro leaves
(Note 4)
1 lb White Onions, chopped
6 cl Garlic, minced (Note 1)
2 lb Jalapeno peppers seeded and
Finely chopped (Note 2)
5 lb Tomatoes, peeled and chopped
Note 1: I like more garlic in mine so I increase garlic to 10 cloves.
Note 2: For hotter salsa, leave the seeds in. Reminder: when working
with jalapeno's wear gloves, that is unless your skin is
:
made
of asbestos. Note 3: Quickly immerse the tomatoes in
:
boiling water to ease peeling. Note 4: Reduce Cilantro to 1/4 cup if
using dried leaves.

Directions: Place the Onion, Garlic, Chilies, Tomatoes, Salt, and
Vinegar in a large pot. Heat to a rolling simmer and simmer for 10
minutes. Stir in Cilantro.  Pack into clean, hot, pint or half-pint
canning jars. Adjust lids and rings and seal.  Allow 1/2 inch
head-space. Process for 15 minutes in a simmering how-water bath.
Makes 12 to 16 cups (6-8 pints). Submitted By MIKE NIEBAUER   On
