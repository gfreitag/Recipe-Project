1 x  Pepper, to taste
1 x  Small onion, diced

In a large bowl combine flour and dash salt. With pastry blender or
two knives cut shortening into flour until mixture resembles gravel.
Slowly add water until mixture forms a ball. The pastry will be
stickier than regular pie crust. With floured hands shape pastry into
a ball, cover with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator
while preparing filling. In a large bowl combine beef or venison,
pork, potatoes, carrot, onion, rutabaga and suet, sprinkle with
parsley, salt, pepper and melted butter. Mix well. Divide pastry
dough into 10 equal parts. On a well floured surface roll each part
into an 8 inch circle. Mound about 1-1/4 cups filling on half of the
dough circle; fold the other half over the filling and crimp edges
together well. Transfer to an ungreased cookie sheet. Continue with
rest of dough and filling. Bake at 325 for 1 to 1-1/2 hours until
lightly browned. Makes 10 large pasties.
