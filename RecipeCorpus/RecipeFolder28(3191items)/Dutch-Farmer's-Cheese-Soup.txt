bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes,

thick. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day

Preheat the broiler.  Transfer the soup to a large broilerproof bowl

the soup and place the cheese slices on top, covering the bread
completely. Broil 6 inches from the heat source until the cheese
melts and is golden, watching closely to avoid burning, about 32
minutes. Serve immediately.

NOTE:  "A crouton topped with melted Gouda cheese is the delicious
accent to an appealing meatless soup."

Makes 6 servings.
