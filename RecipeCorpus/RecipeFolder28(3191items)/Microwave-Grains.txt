Title: Microwave Grains
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 ea Millet
1/3 ea Brown rice
1/3 ea Barley
I was bored with rice, so I mixed 1/3 brown rice, 1/3 barley, and 1/3
millet.  Rinsed well, then put it in the microwave for ten minutes on
high, and let it stand for a few hours.  (I just put it in a big
plastic bowl, and I didn't measure the water.)  It was yummy
underneath chili, beans, and spaghetti sauce.  (3 different meals.)
