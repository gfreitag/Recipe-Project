Title: LA SENORA'S FLOUR TORTILLAS
Categories: Breads, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
To retain her dignity
-during these cooking
-lessons, but often could
-not
Help herself, and collapsed
-into the corner overcome
-with giggles,
Holding her hand over her
-mouth to lessen the sound
-of her laughter...
4 c  Flour
2 t  Salt
1/8 t  Baking powder
Combine flour, salt and
-baking powder; stir well.
-Cut in shortening
2/3 c  Shortening
1 c  Plus 3 T. hot tap water
(Two Dozen)
This is the way Sra. Lute
-taught me to make
-tortillas...She insisted
That the damp towel (a
-paper towel works fine)
-was essential to keep the
Dough from drying out while
-you are working...
The senora didn't believe
-that I wanted to learn to
-cook at first, but
Soon warmed to the idea,
-and taught me the way she
-did things (which was
Plenty good enough for
-me)...she was a 60ish
-matron, who tried very hard
with pastry blender (or with fingers, the way the senora did it),
until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Gradually stir in water, mixing
well. Put an ungreased comal (griddle) or skillet over medium heat so
that the tortillas can be cooked as soon as they are rolled out.
Work quickly. Pinch off a chunk of dough and shape it into a
walnut-size ball; place in a bowl covered with a damp towel to keep
moist.  Repeat until you have used all the dough.  Roll each ball out
on a lightly floured surface into a very thin circle, or on your
first few hundred attempts, an amoeba shape. (The amoebas taste just
as good)  Circles should be about 6 inches in diameter, but try for
thinness more than diameter. Place tortilla on hot skillet and cook
about two minutes on each side, until lightly brown. Serve hot.
