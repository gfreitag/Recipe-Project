parsnip and curry powder. Cook gently 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add tomato paste and mix well. Blend cornstarch with a little stock.
Add remaining stock to ground beef mixture and bring to a boil. Add
cornstarch mixture and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Simmer
mixture 10 minutes.

Lay pancakes, cooked-sides up, on a flat surface. Spread filling in a
2" horizontal lines across center to within 1-1/2" of side edges.
Fold these side edges over mixture and then fold remaining top and
bottom edges over to cover filling. Brush with egg and fold pancakes
in half. Chill 1 hour.

Half fill a deep fat fryer or saucepan with oil; heat to 350'F.

pancakes, 4 at a time, 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and heated
through. Drain on paper towels. Garnish with carrot strip, if
desired, and serve hot.
