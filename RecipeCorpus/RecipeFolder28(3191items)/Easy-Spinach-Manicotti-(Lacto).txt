Title: Easy Spinach Manicotti (Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1    Egg white (or fave egg
Replacer)
1 cn Spinach (or use frozen if
You can?t find it canned)
1 pk Shredded fat free mozzarella
Cheese
1 pk Manicotti pasta (jumbo
Shells will also do)
1    Jar of your favorite pasta
Sauce
1    Container of fat free
Ricotta cheese
Cook manicotti or shells until almost done. Meaning the pasta should
still be a little hard. Drain and cool. In a bowl, mix ricotta
cheese, spinach, egg white with half of tje package mozzarella
cheese. Mixture should be a little thick -- not runny. If runny, add
more mozzarella cheese. Add about 3 tablespoons of pasta sauce to
mixture and whatever herbs you prefer... basil, oregano, parsley, etc.

When manicotti is cool, stuff with mixture and place in a baking pan.
Top with remaining pasta sauce and sprinkle remaining mozzarella
cheese. Bake for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees or until cheese is
fully melted on top.

This freezes well. I generally make this the night before and
refrigerate it for the next day. Yum!
