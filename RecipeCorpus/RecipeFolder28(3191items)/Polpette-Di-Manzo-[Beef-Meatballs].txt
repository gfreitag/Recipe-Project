Title: Polpette Di Manzo [Beef Meatballs]
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Day-old bread crumbs
1/3 c  Milk
Dry bread crumbs
Olive oil
Lemon wedges (optional)
Parsley sprigs
1 lb Ground beef
1    Egg
1 1/2 tb Parsley, chopped
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Parmesan cheese
Soak the crumbs in the milk for about 10 minutes. Put the beef in a
large bowl, add the eggs, parsley, nutmeg, salt and cheese. Squeeze
out the bread crumbs and add to mixture.  Mix everything well but not
too harshly. Form the mixture into balls about the size of an egg and
flatten slightly. Roll in the dry breadcrumbs, patting gently to get
them well covered. Pour the oil in a heated frying pan and allow to
get quite hot. Put in the polpette and cook until lightly brown and
crisp all around. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Serve
with lemon wegdes and parsley sprigs. Submitted By NICK LA ROCCA   On
