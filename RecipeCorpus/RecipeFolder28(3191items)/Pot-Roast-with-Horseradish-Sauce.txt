browned; stir often.  Add tomato juice, horseradish, and wine; mix
well. Return meat to pan.

3. Cover and simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until done. (Or cook in a
325F oven for same amount of time.) Turn meat once to cook it evenly
throughout and baste with sauce.  Skim off excess fat.

4. If sauce is too thin, remove meat to a platter and keep warm. Mix 2
tablespoosn flour in 1/3 cup cold water.  Add mixture slowly to sauce.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and cook until thickened, about
3 minutes. Taste sauce and correct seasoning, if necessary, with salt
and pepper.

5. If sauce needs only a little thickening, remove meat, skim off
excess fat, and simmer, uncovered, for a few minutes.

6. Slice meat and serve sauce.
