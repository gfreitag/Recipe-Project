** make into a thin paste.

Combine soy and sherry for marinade. Marinate steak pieces for 1 hour.
Massage meat in marinade to aid tenderizing; drain, reserving
marinade. Wash and soak mushrooms for 1 hour; drain, reserving
soaking liquid, thinly slice. Wash, peel and roll-cut carrots.
(Roll-cut means slicing on a slight bias in 1" lengths but turning
the carrot a quarter turn (90 degrees) between slices. Wash
cauliflower, trim off thick part of stems, and either break or cut
florets into pieces about the size of the carrot pieces.

Parboil carrots in boiling stock for about 3 minutes or until just
beginning to soften. Reserve carrots and stock. Stir-frying: Heat
peanut oil in hot wok. When oil just begins to smoke, add drained
steak cubes; stir-fry briskly for 1 minute until meat begins to loose
pinkness. Don't overcook meat or it will be tough. Remove to holding
plate. Swirl remaining oil into wok. Add ginger, garlic and
peppercorns; stir-fry 15 seconds. Add cauliflower and mushrooms;
stir-fry 1 minute. Add specified amounts of liquids generated during
preparation: reserved carrot stock, marinade, and mushroom soaking
liquid; bring to boil. Cover wok; reduce heat to medium, and simmer 3
minutes. Remove lid; turn heat to high. When sauce boils again, add
carrots and beef. Mix together. Splash vinegar down sides of wok.
Push ingredients out of sauce, thicken with thin cornstarch paste.

Sauce should be a light gravy. Add sesame oil. Toss in green onion.
Serve.
