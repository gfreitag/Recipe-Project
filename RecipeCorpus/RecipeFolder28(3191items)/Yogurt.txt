Title: Yogurt
Categories: Condiments, Indian
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
2 1/2 c  Long-life milk
1 tb Plain yogurt
1 tb To 2 tbs skim milk powder
Mix together the yogurt and skim milk powder to form a smooth paste.
Heat the milk to lukewarm and stir it into the yogurt paste. Pour it
into a clean thermos bottle and leave for about 6 hours until the
yogurt has set. Empty the yogurt into a clean container and store in
the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Note: I don't know the US equivalent of long-life milk.
