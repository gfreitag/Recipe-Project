Title: Layered Custard Bars
Categories: Low-cal/fat
Yield: 12 servings
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Pourable fruit, peach
1 tb Butter; nelted
1/4 c  Almonds, sliced
1/4 ts Cinnamon, ground
1 c  Flour
1/8 ts Salt
8 tb Butter; cold
2 tb Liqueur, almond
16 oz Peaches, canned, no sugar
For pourable fruit, you may substitute 6 tb peach fruit spread
combined with 2 tb warm water.

If almond liqueur is unavailable, you may substitute 2 tb apple juice
concentrate AND 1/2 ts almond extract.

Preheat oven to 350.  Combine flour and salt in medium bowl. Cut in
butter with pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Add liqueur; mix well.  Press dough evenly onto bottom
of 8" square baking pan.  Bake 15 minutes, until set.

Arrange peaches evenly over partially baked crust; if using fruit
halves, cut into slices first.  Combine eggs and pourable fruit; mix
until well blended.  Pour evenly over peaches; set aside. Melt
butter; add almonds and cinnamon and mix lightly. Sprinkle almond
mixture evenly over egg mixture. Bake 20-25 minutes, until almonds
are golden brown and custard is set.

Cool completely on wire rack.  Cut into bars.  Serve at room
temperature or chilled.  Refrigerate leftover bars.
