2 tb Ex-virgin olive oil with
1    Cl Garlic
Preheat oven to 400~.

GARLIC-OIL-Let 1 clove garlic soak in 2 tb olive oil for 1 hour before
using. Line a sheet pan or cookie sheet with foil. Dribble 2 tb
garlic oil over Boboli, sprinkle with cheese and bake for 4 to 5
minutes, until hot, but not crisped or dried. Cut the Boboli into 6
wedges or 2x2" squares.

Remove to a serving plate and cover, generously, with a cold
tomato/basil topping, serve immediately.

TOPPING-Blend all ingredients thoroughly and refrigerate for 2 hours
before serving. Just prior to serving, drain in a colander or
strainer to eliminate excess liquid.

(My Note: I would prefer minced garlic mixed with the olive oil).
