1 ts Coleman's dry mustard
1 ts Paprika
Freshly ground pepper
6    Foot long hot dogs
1/2 c  Water
1    Med onion; sliced or chopped
1/3 c  Ketchup
4 tb Cider vineger
In saucepan combine water, onion, ketchup, vineger, dry mustard,
paprika, and pepper.  Bring to boil. reduce heat; simmer 5 minutes.
Arrange hot dogs side by side in shallow 9X9 pan. Cover with onion
mixture and bake at 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes. Makes 3-4
servings. Hope it turns out well. The best hot dogs you can use is
Sabrett's they are the ones that the vendors usually sell. I think
you can buy them in some supermarkets. This is the closest to a
vendor hot dog with onions that I could find, I hope you like it.
