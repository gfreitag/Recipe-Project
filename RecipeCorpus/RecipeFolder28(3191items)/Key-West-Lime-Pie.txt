put cool whip on it after it cools off.

Combine cornstarch, sugar, and salt in saucepan; gradually add water,
stirring until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring,
and boil 1 minute. Remove from heat and quickly add 1/2 of the hot
mixture to the egg yolks, mixing well. Return to the hot mixture,
blending thoroughly.

Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, over medium heat. Boil 1 minute
longer. Remove from heat; stir in lime juice and peel and food
coloring to make filling a delicate green. Pour into cooled pie shell
