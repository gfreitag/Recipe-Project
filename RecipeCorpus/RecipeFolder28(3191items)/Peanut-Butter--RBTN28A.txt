Title: Peanut Butter  RBTN28A
Categories: Appetizers, Desserts
Yield: 40 servings
2 tb Corn or Peanut oil
2 c  Fresh-roasted peanuts
Buy sone fresh-roasted peanuts, still in their shells. Sit down with
your kids and shell 2 cupfuls. Place the peanuts in a blender, add 2
table-spoons of corn oil or peanut oil, and turn the blender on. Stop
it periodically to check on your peanuts progress. Children will enjoy
watching the concoction turn first to chunky peanut butter and then to
creamy. The finished product will be a bit rougher in texture than the
supermarket variety and will taste mor like actual peanuts. Keep your
homemade peanut butter in the refrigerator if you don't want the oil
to separate from the nut paste. (This doesn't happen with most
supermarket brands because they're made from hydrogenated oil- which
keeps the spread togerher but is less healthy for the heart.)
