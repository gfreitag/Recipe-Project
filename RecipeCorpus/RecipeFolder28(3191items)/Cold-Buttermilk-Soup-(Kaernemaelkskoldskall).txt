Categories: West europe, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Vanilla extract
Juice of 1 lemon
4 c  Buttermilk
2    Eggs
4 tb Sugar
Grabbed a little Danish cookbook at a sale this weekend.  After going
through it I've decided that the Danes could give the Japanese a run
for their money as far as strange and wonderful edibles go.  They
depend heavily on fish and even have a version of sushi that I'll go
into in some detail later in the packet.  There is also a hitherto
unsuspected connection between Danish food and Mexican food.  It's
really interesting to see how all these dishes from various countries
inter-link.

I ran across this early on in the Danish book and it raised my
eyebrows enough to keep me going...

Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla together in the bowl
the soup is to be served in.  Beat the buttermilk and fold in a
little at a time.

If you want to make something out of this dish, top the bowl with a
cup of whipped cream.  Small cakes of oat meal, fried in butter and
sugar, pressed into moistened eggs cups and turned onto a plate, are
served with this dish.

It can also be served after the main course with whipped cream,
meringue and sweetened fruit.

From "Danish Cookery" by Suzanne, Andr.  Fred.  Host & Son,
Copenhagen, 1957.
