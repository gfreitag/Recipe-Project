VICTORY: Mix and with together flour; baking powder and salt.  Cream
sugar and shortening until fluffy as whipped cream.  (IF hard
shortening is used, cream thoroughly before adding sugar.  Vegetable
shortenings come already creamed and should be kept at room
temperature at all times.) Add vanilla extract.  Stir in the
well-beaten eggs. Add sifted flour mixture alternately with milk,
starting and finishing with flour. Blend thoroughly between each
addition, working quickly and lightly to keep the batter as smooth
and fluffy as possible. Bake in a prepared loaf pan, 9x5x3", in a
moderate oven 350 F. for about 50 minutes.  An 8" square pan 2" deep
will require about the same time.  Or bake in two prepared 9" layer
cake pans at 375 F. for about 25 or 30 minutes. NUT LOAF CAKES: Add
cinnamon to the flour mixture before sifting.  Add nuts to the
finished batter. PEANUT BRITTLE CAKE:  Use only 1/2 cup sugar instead
3/4 cup.  Add crushed peanut brittle to finished batter. CHOCOLATE
MARBLE CAKE: Divide batter in half. Melt chocolate over hot water;
add to 1/2 half of batter. Drop batters by alternate tablespoo into a
greased, paper-lined loaf pan. CHOCOLATE SPICE CAKE: Add cloves and
cinnamon to flour before sifting. Add 1/2 grated orange rind to
creamed sugar and shortening.  Melt chocolate over hot water.  Add to
creamed mixture. CHOCOLATE CHIP CAKE: Fold semi-sweet chocolate,
coarsely grated, into finished batter. SPICY RAISIN CAKE: Add cloves,
cinnamon and allspice to flour mixture before sifting. Add raisins to
flour and spice mixture after sifting. Fold into creamed mixture
alternately with milk in the usual way. MOCHA NUT CAKE: Substitute
coffee for milk.  Add chopped nuts to finished batter. Source: U.S.
