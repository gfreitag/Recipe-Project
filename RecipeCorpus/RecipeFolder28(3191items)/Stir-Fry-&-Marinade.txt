Title: Stir Fry & Marinade
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1    To 2 cloves garlic crushed,
Or chopped very fine
1 T  Freshly grated ginger root
4 T  Shoyu (or soy sauce)
2 T  Balsamic Vinegar
1 T  Brown sugar
MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
x  Mushrooms
x  Water chesnuts
x  Cornstarch
x  Onion
x  Green pepper
x  Carrots
x  Brocolli
I Use my wok as a steamer, really.  I add onion, green pepper,
carrots, and brocolli all at the same time and stir-fry until the
onions get limp, just with the oil that I 'cured' the wok with last
time I washed it, that is I do not add any.  Then I add about 3/4 cup
of water or broth and cover. The steam cooks the veggies quickly, you
can increase the water for softer veggies, or decrease for crunchier
ones, but cook until all of the liquid is gone.  I then add a can of
water chestnuts and mushrooms along with the marinade mixture and
stir-fry for a few minutes to cook the mushrooms and heat the
chestnuts.  Add about 3/4 teaspoon of cornstarch, and cook for a
minute or so, mix and serve over really good rice. The cornstarch
thickens the marinade and makes it cling to the veggies better.

I love the sweet-sour taste of this marinade, another nice addittion
is to add a can of chunked pineapple, It tastes great and is unusual.

Good luck to all stir-fryers and thank you all for your support.
