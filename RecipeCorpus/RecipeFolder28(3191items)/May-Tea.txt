Title: May Tea
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
Chinese green tea
Dried blackcurrant leaves
Dried mint
For every 2 parts dried blackcurrant leaves add 1 part dried mint and
1 part Chinese green tea.

Crumble the dried leaves slightly and use your hands to mix them
together with the tea.  Store in air-tight tins and use 2 tablespoons
per pot.

The authors mention that this is a calming and refreshing tea and
it's for people who prefer tisanes to a strong tea.  They say to pick
the blackcurrant leaves on a dry day in early May, after the blossoms
have faded and the fruit is just beginning to form.  Be sure to shake
off the bugs.  An early crop of mint should be harvested and they
suggest spearmint or apple mint.  Dry the leaves by spreading them
out on a flat basket and leaving them to dry in a warm place.
