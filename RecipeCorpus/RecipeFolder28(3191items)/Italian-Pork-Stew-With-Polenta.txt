Preparation Time: 2:15

Place pork and 1/2 cup of the water in a 5- to 6-qt pan. Cover and
cook over medium-high heat for 10 mins. Uncover and continue cooking,
stirring, until juices have evaporated and meat is browned (about 5
more mins). Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic; reduce heat to medium
and cook, stirring often, until onion is soft ( about 5 mins).

Add tomatoes (break up with a spoon) and their liquid, wine, dry
rosemary, marjoram, oregano, and thyme, stirring to loosen browned
bits. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, partially covered,
until pork is tender (about 1 1/2 hrs).

About 30 mins before stew is done, bring chicken broth and remaining
water to a boil in a heavy 3- to 4-qt pan over high heat. Stir in
polenta in a thin stream. Cook, stirring, until polenta begins to
thicken; reduce heat to low and continue cooking, stirring often,
until no longer grainy (20 to 25 mins).

Spoon onto a platter and top with stew; sprinkle with parsley.
Garnish with rosemary sprigs, if desired. Makes 6 servings.
