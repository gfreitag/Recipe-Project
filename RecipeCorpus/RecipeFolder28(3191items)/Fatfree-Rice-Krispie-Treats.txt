Title: Fatfree Rice Krispie Treats
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1    10 oz. bag miniature
Marshmallows
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
6 c  Rice Krispies Cereal
(nothing else works as well,
IMO)
Lightly spray a 9" x 13" pan with PAM. Measure out cereal. Pour corn
syrup into a large pot, placed on medium heat. When the syrup has
warmed up a bit, add the marshmallows. Continue to heat, stirring
frequently, until the marshmallows are melted and smooth. Add cereal,
stirring with a large spoon until the cereal is uniformly coated.
Turn out into prepared pan. Cover cereal mixture with waxed paper,
and using hands, spread and press the cereal evenly in the pan,
compressing firmly. Allow the treats to cool for 5 minutes or so
before removing the waxed paper. After the pan has cooled, cut into
squares using a sharp knife dipped in hot water.

Yield: about 18 2" x 3" squares.

NOTE: THESE ARE VERY STICKY!  You'll want to press them down quickly,
because they harden really fast! We put them in the freezer for a
while to make cutting them easier and it also made them easier to
handle in general.
