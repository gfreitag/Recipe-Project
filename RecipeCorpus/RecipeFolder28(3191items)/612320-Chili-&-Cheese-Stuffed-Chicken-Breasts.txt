Cook's Notes: To easily crush chips, place them in plastic bag and
crush with rolling pin.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place chicken breasts between layers of
plastic wrap or waxed paper. Lightly pound chicken breasts with
mallet, meat pounder, or heavy pot.  Try to pound chicken breasts to
a uniform thickness. Set aside.  In a large bowl, stir cheeses,
olives, green chilies and onion.  Place approximately 1/2 cup of
cheese mixture on each chicken breast; roll up and tuck under ends to
completely enclose filling. Secure each breast with wooden toothpick.
Dip each chicken bundle into melted margarine and roll in crushed
tortilla chips to completely cover. Place chicken bundles in 8 x 12
inch baking dish. Top with additional crushed tortilla chips; cover
with aluminum foil and bake for 35 minutes.

MICROWAVE: Place chicken in microwave safe dish and cover with waxed
paper. Microwave on high for 12 minutes.  Test to make sure chicken
is cooked through and no pink remains (especially those that were
positioned in middle of dish).  Remove toothpicks and serve.  Garnish
with your favorite salsa and sour cream, if desired.  Makes 8
servings. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   02-26-95
