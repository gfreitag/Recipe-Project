Categories: Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 8 servings
Pepper freshly ground
1/4 lb Goat cheese
2 tb Butter
1 1/2 lb Asparagus, fresh
2 tb Chives, chopped fresh
1 lb Fettuccine
1. Scrape and trim the asparagus. Slice the spears on the bias,
creating lengths of 1/4 inch.
2. In a kettle, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add the
fettuccine, boiling vigorously for 9 to 12 minutes. Do not overcook;
the pasta should be al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water
and drain the pasta. 3. Melt the butter in the kettle and add the
asparagus. Saute for about 1 minute and add the fettuccine, goat
cheese, chives and the pepper. Pour in the reserved water. Toss well
and serve.
