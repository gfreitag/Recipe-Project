Title: Pomander Gin
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
4 oz Sugar
1    Bottle gin
1 lg Seville orange
12    Whole cloves
Stick the cloves into the orange (it helps to pierce the skin with a
skewer first) and then put the orange and the sugar into a large,
wide-necked jar. Fill with gin.  Seal firmly.  Keep in a warm place.
Give the jar a good shake and turn it upside down and back again
every day until the sugar is dissolved.  Then leave in a cool place
for 3 months. At the end of that time discard the orange and strain
the liqueur into clean bottles. Again, seal firmly.

The authors say to use Seville oranges when they are in season;
otherwise use any large firm orange and half the quantity of sugar.
This can be drunk on its own or served on lemon or orange sorbet or
on hot buttered cabbage.
