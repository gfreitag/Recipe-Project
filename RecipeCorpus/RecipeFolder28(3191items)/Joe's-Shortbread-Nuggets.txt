Title: Joe's Shortbread Nuggets
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 batch
-meal
Vanilla
pn Salt
Walnuts (optional)
3 oz Butter
1 oz Cornflour
1 oz Icing sugar
4 oz Plain flour; white or whole
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Melt the butter in a saucepan, sift the dry
ingredients into the butter, add a few drops of vanilla and cook over
a low heat, stirring well until the mixture leaves the sides of the
pan and forms a ball.  If it seems too soft add a bit more flour.
Form with wet hands into walnut-sized nuggets and place on an
ungreased baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.  Bake until they are a
light gold color on top (about 8-10 minutes).  Cool on a rack.  A
walnut can be pressed onto the top of each nugget before baking if
you like.
