"This is without a doubt the best pot roast I have ever eaten; it is
tender, rich, filling, and satisfying, and just so good."

Rub seasonings into meat.  Brown roast in oil over medium-high heat
in a large, heavy dutch oven.  Pour 2 cups water around meat; arrange
onion wedges on top of meat. Cover tightly, reduce heat, and simmer 1
1/2 to 2 hours, or until meat is very tender.  Add carrots and
potatoes to dutch oven, cover tightly, and simmer 30 minutes, or
until vegetables are tender.

Remove from heat; transfer roast and vegetables to a serving platter,
and keep warm.  Measure drippings and add water to make 3 cups.  Pour
into dutch oven, add flour, and whisk until smooth. Cook over medium
heat until mixture is thickened, whisking constantly.  Season to
taste with salt and pepper.  Serve with roast, vegetables, and
biscuits.
