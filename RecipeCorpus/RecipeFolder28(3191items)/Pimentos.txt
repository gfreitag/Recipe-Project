Title: Pimentos
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 ts Olive oil
4    Sweet red bell peppers
Boiling water
1 c  Cider vinegar
1 c  Water
Recipe by: The Cook's Book of Uncommon Recipes - ISBN 0-940367-14-9

Clean peppers and remove stem, seeds and with pith. Cut into strips.
Cover with boiling water and allow to stan for 5 mins. Drain. While
peppers are steeping, bring to a boil vinegar, water, sugar, and salt
and simmer for 5 mins.

Place pepper strips in a sterilized quart bottle and pour the vinegar
mixture over them. Cover and store in the refrigerator. Peppers should
marinate for about 2 weeks before you use them.

The pimentos will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator but for
longer storage, if you use them only occasionally, divide among small
containers and freeze. This will make about 3-4 cups of pimento
strips.

NOTES : Another prized but expensive treat that is relatively easy to
make
and store.
Since the recipe directions did not mention where to use the
olive
oil, I would suggest adding it into the vinegar mixture and
boiling all together.
