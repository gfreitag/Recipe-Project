warm. In large pot bring water, salt and oil to rolling boil. Add
pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm (8-12
minutes). Grate Parmesan and chop chives or other herb while pasta
boils. Remove soup plates from oven; put half the ricotta, herb,
butter and I heaping tablespoon Parmesan in each. Drain pasta, place

pretty and good.) Keep extra Parmesan close by to add a finishing
touch.
