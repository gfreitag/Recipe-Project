Title: MARBLED CREAM CHEESE BROWNIES
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate, Godiva
Yield: 15 to 20
4 lg Eggs, at room temperature
1 tb Vanilla extract, divided
1 c  Unsalted butter, softened
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
6 oz Semisweet chocolate,
-coarsely chopped
3 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
-coarsely chopped
16 oz Cream cheese, softened
2 c  Granulated sugar, divided
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees F.
Line a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil so that the foil
extends 2 inches beyond the long sides of the pan. Lightly butter
the
bottom and sides of the foil-lined pan.

Melt the chocolates according to the melting instructions in the
Chocolate Key. Cool the chocolate for 10 to 15 minutes, until
tepid.
In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium
speed,
beat together the cream cheese and 1/3 cup of the sugar until
smooth.
Beat in one of the eggs and 1 teaspoon of the vanilla until
combined.
In another large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at
medium
speed, beat the butter and remaining 1 2/3 cups of sugar until
combined.

One at a time, beat in the remaining 3 eggs, beating well after
each
addition. Beat in the melted chocolate and the remaining 2
teaspoons of
vanilla extract. On low speed, beat in the flour and salt, just
until
combined.

Scrape all but 1 cup of the chocolate batter into the prepared
pan and
smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Spread the cream cheese
mixture
evenly over the batter. Spoon the reserved chocolate batter over
the
cream cheese mixture. Using a table knife, pull it through the
layers of
batter with a slight lifting motion, in a zigzag pattern to
create a
marbleized pattern. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a cake
tester or
toothpick inserted 2 inches away from the center comes out with a
few
moist crumbs clinging to it.

Cool the brownies in the pan set on a wire rack. When the
brownies are
completely cooled, using the two ends of the foil as handles,
lift the
brownies out of the pan. Cut into squares.
