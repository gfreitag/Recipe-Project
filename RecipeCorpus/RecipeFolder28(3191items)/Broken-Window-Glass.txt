Categories: Desserts
Yield: 3 servings
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Pineapple juice
1 1/2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1/3 c  Melted butter
2    Envelopes of Dream Whip
3 oz Package of orange Jello
3 oz Package of cherry Jello
3 oz Package of lime Jello
4 c  Boiling water
1 1/2 c  Cold water
3 oz Lemon Jello
Prepare the 3 flavors of Jello separately, using 1 cup of boiling
water and 1/2 cup of cold water for each.  Pour each flavor into an 8
inch square pan.  Chill until firm, preferably overnight.  Combine
the lemon Jello, sugar and 1 cup of boiling water.  Stir until Jello
and sugar are dissolved.  Stir in pineapple juice, chill until
slightly thickened. Meanwhile, mix the crumbs and melted butter;
press into a 9 inch pie pan. Cut the firm Jello into 1/2 inch cubes.
Prepare the whipped topping as directed on the package.  Blend with
lemon Jello. Fold in Jello cubes. Pour into pan.  Chill at least 5
hours, again preferably overnight. If desired, you can spread
additional topping on top. Note: Any combination of Jello can be
used. To remove the cubes from the pan, quickly dip the pan in warm
water and invert on waxed paper. Randy Rigg Submitted By RANDY RIGG
