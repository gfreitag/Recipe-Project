Title: Crock Pot Turkey+
Categories: Turkey
Yield: 1 trky. brst
Garlic powder
Paprika
6 lb Turkey breast
1 tb Salt
2 lg Onions
Thaw frozen turkey in refrigerator till almost thawed (varies in
different refrigerators). The next day put the breast of turkey in a
large bowl with salt water, about 1 tb. of salt. Refrigerate
overnight. Slice the onions and put in the bottom of the stockpot.
Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with garlic powder and
paprika, liberally. Cook 4 1/2 hours on high.

NOTE: I tried a 4 lb. 1/2 turkey breast with the same instructions
and it turned out great! This is the greatest way to cook an unwieldy
turkey breast that I have happened upon.
