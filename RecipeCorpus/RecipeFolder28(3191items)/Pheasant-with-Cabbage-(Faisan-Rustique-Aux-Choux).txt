Rosendale Road London SE21 8LG METRIC/IMPERIAL U.S. 1 pheasant 1 25
2 tbsp 3 large onions 3
g/1 oz butter/vegetable margarine
fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large green cabbages
2 4 small sausages 4 1 ham knuckle (hock)
1 1 bouquet garni comprising bay leaf,
thyme and rosemary pinch of quatre-epices freshly chopped parsley, to
garnish A traditional French country recipe, kindly given to us by
Julien, chef of "La Chaumiere", a delightful small restaurant in
Lauris-sur-Durance, in Provence. This simple and delicious method can
also be used for partridge, but reduce the cooking time by about one
third. Wipe clean and dry the pheasant. Pluck out any remaining
feathers, then truss the bird. Melt the butter in a large flameproof
casserole and cook the pheasant over a hot flame until all sides are
golden. Add the chopped onions, stir and add salt and pepper to
taste. Cover with the lid and leave to cook over a very gentle heat
for 1 hour. During this time, wash and chop the cabbages, then blanch
them in boiling salted water for 2 - 3 minutes . Drain the cabbage
and add to the pheasant, with the sausages, ham, bouquet garni and
spice. Allow them all to simmer for about 4 hours. At the end of this
time, remove the bouquet garni. Untruss the pheasant and serve with
the sausages and ham on a large dish, on top of a bed of cabbage,
garnished with parsley.
