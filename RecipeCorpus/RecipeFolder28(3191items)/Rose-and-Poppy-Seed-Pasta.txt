Categories: Pasta
Yield: 4 servings

"This spicy pasta is greatly enhanced by its exotic colours - the
bright red rose petals and the deep purple (AM ?) poppy seeds. It is
an easy dish to make and is light; yet surprisingly filling. Serve it
for lunch on a warm summer's day with a crisp green salad.

Cook the pasta shells in plenty of boiling, salted water until al
dente. Drain, toss in a little sunflower oil and keep warm.

Put the remaining oil in a pan with the onion rings and sweat gently
until the onion is soft but not browned. Lift out the onion with a
slotted spoon and mix with the pasta shells.

Put the garlic into the oil in which the onions were cooked and fry,
stirring for 1 minute. Mix the cooked garlic into the pasta.

Toss the pasta in a warmed serving bowl or dish and sprinkle over the
poppy seeds and seasoning to taste. Just before serving, throw in the
rose petals.
