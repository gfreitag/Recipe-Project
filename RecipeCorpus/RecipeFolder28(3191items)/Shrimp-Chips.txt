Title: Shrimp Chips
Categories: Chinese, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
3 1/2 c  (approx) vegetable oil
1 lb Box shrimp chips
Shrimp chips are thin translucent wafers in assorted colors, made from
shrimp flavored rice flour paste. When deep-fried very briefly, they
puff up to three times their original size.

Heat vegetable oil to deep-frying temperature, and fry a few chips at
a time.  Serve hot.  Keep leftover wafers in an airtight jar.
