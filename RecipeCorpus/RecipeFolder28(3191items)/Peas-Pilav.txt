Hi Everyone: I really like "one pot" recipes and this one from the LA
Times, issued 3/l2/92 really fits that for me. Now, if I could just
get rid of the "pot" I carry around my waist, we would be in business!
:) :) This recipe is by Fatima Lakhani, author of "Indian Recipes for
a Healthy Heart." Combine tomatoes, peas, yogurt, garlic, ginger,
coriander, cumin, garam masala, l/2 tsp. salt, and turmeric in bowl.
Heat canola oil in large saucepan.  Add onion, green chiles, cinnamon
sticks, peppercorns and cumin seeds and saute until onion starts to
turn golden. Add tomato mixture and stir. Cover and cook over medium
heat l0 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add water, remaining 3/4
tsp. salt, potatoes and cilantro. Stir well, cover and bring to boil.
Add rice, stir gently and cook, covered, until almost all the water
has been absorbed, about l0 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook l0
to l5 minutes, or until rice is tender.
