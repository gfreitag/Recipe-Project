Vanilla Extract: It is best to use a brown-glass bottle to prepare
vanilla extract. You can purchase one from your pharmacy it you don't
have one on hand that you can recycle. Cut the vanilla bean into
several long pieces that will fit into the bottle. Fill the bottle
with vodka. Allow it to steep for 4 weeks, shaking from time to time.
After you have used about 1/4 of the bottle, add enough additional
vodka to fill the bottle again.

Citrus Extracts: Use well-colored fruit and remove the strips of the
zest. (The outer colored portion of the peel...do not include any of
the white pithy part.) You will probably be happier using a wide
mouth bottle to make citrus extracts. Put the zest in the bottle
(until it is about 1/3 filled with zest) then fill the bottle with
vodka. Allow it to steep for 2 weeks, shaking from time to time. This
extract can not be replenished in the way you can the vanilla extract
so after 2 weeks, pour the extract through a fine sieve into a
brown-glass bottle and discard the zest.
