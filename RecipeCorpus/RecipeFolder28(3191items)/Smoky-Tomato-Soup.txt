Chef Jamie Kennedy created this for the 1994 Feast of Fiels, a fund
raiser in Ontario to support organic agriculture.  His soup
highlights the flavor of a heritage tomato variety, developed
specifically for drying. He smokes dried tomatoes to give them a
smoky bacon flavor. Since hothouse tomatoes aren't usually as sweet
as field tomatoes, you might want to add a pinch of sugar. 1/4 cup
olive oil 1 large spanish onion, minced 1 clove garlic, minced 7
large tomatoes 1-1/2 cups vegetable stock or water 1/2 cup sin dried
tomatoes 2 tbsp chopped fresh basil 1/2 cup whipping cream salt and
pepper

Saute the onions and garlic until translucent.  Chop all of the
tomatoes and add the sun dried tomatoes, basil, and onions and garlic
to the stock. Bring to boil and simmer for about 7 minutes.  After
the tomatoes are cooked and the sun dried tomatoes have plumped up a
bit, puree until smooth.  Add cream and season to taste. Origin:
