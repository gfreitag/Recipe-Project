Preparation Time: 1:05 1. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a large bowl,
combine cake mix, 2/3 cup brandy, 1/2 cup water, oil, and eggs. Beat
with an electric mixer on high 2 mins, scraping down bowl a few
times. Stir in 1 cup chocolate chips. Turn into a well-greased 12-cup
bundt pan.

2. Bake 35 to 45 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean.

3. During last 7 mins of bake baking time, prepare glaze. In a small
saucepan, combine butter, remaining 1/3 cup brandy, corn syrup, brandy
extract, and 2 Tbs water. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally,
until butter melts. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips and
powdered sugar. Simmer, stirring, over low heat 5 mins.

4. Immediately upon removal from oven, spoon 2/3 of hot glaze over
cake. Let cake cool in pan 25 mins, then invert onto a cake plate.
Reheat remaing glaze and spoon evenly over top of cake. Let cool
completely. Cake is best if made a day in advance of serving time to
allow flavors to mellow.
