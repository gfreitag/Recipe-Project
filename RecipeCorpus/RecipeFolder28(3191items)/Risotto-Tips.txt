Title: Risotto Tips
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 info  Start with a high-quality, medium-grain white rice and a flavorful
stock. Superfine arborio is preferred, but any kind of arborio rice
is good.

For a standard risotto, the rice is sauted in a generous amount of
fat to seal the grains and keep them separate. If you want to adapt a
risotto recipe you like to make it low fat, cook  the grains in a
small amount of fat. The grains won't be as well sealed and therefore
will absorb a larger amount of stock ÄÄ so be sure  to increase the
stock by at least one cup.
