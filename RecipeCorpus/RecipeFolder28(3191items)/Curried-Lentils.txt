Recipe by: Jane Brody's Good Food Book

In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils, broth or water, half the
onions, and salt. Bring the ingredients to a boil, reduce the heat,
cover the pan, and simmer the lentils until they are tender, about
30-40 minutes.  Drain the lentils.

While the lentils are cooking, heat the oil in a skillet, add the
remaining onions and the garlic, and saute the vegetables until they
begin to brown. Add them to the cooked lentils along with the curry,
combining the ingredients well.  Cover the pan and heat the lentils a
few minutes longer.

Serve over rice.
