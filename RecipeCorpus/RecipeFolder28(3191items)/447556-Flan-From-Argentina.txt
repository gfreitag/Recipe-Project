heat and very slowly stir in boiling water.  Stir until smooth. Pour
into shallow round baking dish, 10 inches.  Mix all ingredients
thoroughly and pour over cooled carmelized sugar.  Pour slowly so
carmelized sugar stays on bottom. Place in a water bath. Bake at 350
degrees for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until set. Remove from oven and let
cool. Chill in refrigerator. Loosen edges and turn out onto flat dish
to serve. Top with fresh strawberries. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN
