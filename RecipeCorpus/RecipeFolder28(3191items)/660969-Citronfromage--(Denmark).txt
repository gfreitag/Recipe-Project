Title: 660969 Citronfromage  (Denmark)
Categories: West europe, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
-Juice of 1 or 2 lemons
-(according to taste)
1/2 c  Whipping cream
4    Eggs, separated
6 T  Sugar
-Grated rind of 1 lemon
1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
Beat the egg yolks with sugar until light, then add the lemon rind.
Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff.  Dissolve the
gelatin in the lemon juice over a very low heat.  Allow to cool
before adding to the egg mixture, and finally fold in the egg whites.
Pour into a glass bowl and allow to set for 1 to 2 hours in the
refrigerator. Just before serving, whip the cream and spread or pipe
it on top of the souffle. If you use the juice of 2 lemons, the sharp
flavor contrasts well with the bland whipped cream.
