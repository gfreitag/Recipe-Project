Title: Bean Mix Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Dried onions
1    Bay leaf
2 tb Powdered beef broth
1 cn Tomato soup
1 lb Hamburg, fried & drained
1/4 c  White beans
1/4 c  Kidney beans
1/4 c  Split peas
1/4 c  Pinto beans
2 tb Pot barley
2 tb Parsley
Sort and wash beans. Cover generously with water and soak overnight OR
bring to a boil and let simmer for 1-2 minutes. Then remove from heat
and let stand for one hour. Drain.

Top with 6 cups water, add bay leaf and onions, and simmer until done
(1 1/2-2 hours). Add tomato soup, hamburg, powdered beef broth, and
parsley. Simmer a few more minutes.

Do not add salt of any kind until the last 5 minutes. It toughens the
beans and the cooking time will be twice as long.
