3/4 c  Diced boiling potato
3/4 ts Ground turmeric
3/4 c  Frozen peas; thawed
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/4 c  Fresh lemon or lime juice
2 c  Poha (thick flaked rice)
1/3 c  Chopped cilantro
2 tb Unsweetened grated coconut
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Mustard seed
1/4 ts Asafetida
1 sm Dried red chili; halved
1    Serrano chili; minced
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Dried curry leaves
1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
6    Whole black peppercorns

In a heavy large saucepan, heat oil over high heat.  Add mustard
seeds and cover immediately.  When seeds stop popping, add asafetida.
Immediately reduce heat to medium.  Add chilies, cumin, curry leaves,
ginger, peppercorns and cloves and stir 1 minute.  Reduce heat to
medium. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, stirring
frequently, about 8 minutes. Add potato and turmeric.  Cover and cook
until potato is almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 10
minutes. Add peas. Cover and cook 5 minutes.

Combine salt, sugar and juice.  Stir until salt and sugar are
dissolved. In a colander, rinse poha under cold water.  Place poha,
juice mixture, cilantro and coconut in a saucepan and stir gently,
being careful not to break rice flakes.  Transfer to platter and
serve.
