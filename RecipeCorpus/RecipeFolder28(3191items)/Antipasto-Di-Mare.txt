Here's a different way to serve tuna.

Any combination of fresh raw salad vegetables you choose will work
very well.

Drain tuna while still in can and invert onto center of large plate.
Drizzle oil over tuna, season with pepper and sprinkle with capers;
scatter olives over dish. Arrange vegetables on plateQthose listed
above or others you like. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle lemon
juice over all. Serve with crusty bread or crackers.

Makes two servings.
