Title: Green Banana Gratin
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
Salt
Ground Nutmeg
1 pn Cinnamon
1 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
1/2 c  Fresh Bread Crumbs
3 lb Green bananas
2 c  Chicken Stock
2 tb Butter
1    Small Onion, chopped
1 c  Light cream or milk
2    Eggs, beaten
Grated Gruyere cheese can be used instead of cheddar cheese. Place
bananas in saucepan and add just enough chicken stock to cover. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until bananas are tender, about 20
to 25 minutes. Using a potato masher, mash until smooth (chicken
stock will be absorbed). Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat butter in
a small frypan and saute onions until tender. Add the onions, cream,
beaten eggs to cooked bananas until combined; season with salt,
nutmeg and cinnamon to taste. Mixture will be quite moist. Place
banana mixture in a buttered shallow baking dish. Combine cheese with
bread crumbs; sprinkle over top. Bake at 350 for 35 - 40 minutes or
until top is golden. Serves 4 - 6. From The Gazette, 91/02/13.
