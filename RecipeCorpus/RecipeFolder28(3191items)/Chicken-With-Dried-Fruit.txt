Sprinkle chicken with salt, if desired, and pepper. In large,
non-stick, spray-coated skillet, cook chicken over medium heat until
meat turns white. Remove to medium bowl and reserve.

In same skillet, cook onion and garlic in oil and 3 Tbs broth until
onion is tender, about 5 or 6 mins. If liquid begins to evaporate,
add more broth. Add remaining broth, rum, fruit, red pepper, ginger,
and bay leaf. Stir to mix well.

Stir in reserved chicken. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and
cook 20 mins or until flavors are well blended. Remove bay leaf.
Uncover skillet, raise heat, and cook, stirring frequently, until
sauce has thickened slightly.

Meanwhile, cook rice according to package directions. Arrange rice on
serving platter, and top with fruit and chicken mixture. Garnish with
additional apricots, if desired.
