Peel bananas and remove any bruised portions. Cut into slices about
1/4 inch thick. In a large pan combine all ingredients, bring to boil
stirring constantly and continue to maintain full rolling boil for 10
mins while you continue to stir. Reduce heat to medium-low setting
and simmer, stirring frequently to keep jam from sticking, for about
20 mins or until thickened.

Remove from heat and immediately ladle into sterilized half pint jars.
Process for 15 mins in a boiling water bath. This jam can also be
frozen.

YIELD: about 8 half-pint jars.

(Author's Note): Flavorful bananas make an outstanding jam. If you
are a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich fiend, wait until you
sink your teeth into a peanut butter and banana jam sandwich.
