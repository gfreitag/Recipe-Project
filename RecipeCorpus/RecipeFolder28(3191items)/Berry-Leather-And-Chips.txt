Title: Berry Leather And Chips
Categories: Fruit, Snacks
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Berries
The ingredients may be a bit uncommon....but the theory is the same,
no matter what fruit you use, so make cherry leather...or orange
leather...or....well you get the idea.

PUREES, FRUIT LEATHERS & CHIPS: Fruit leathers are dried leathery
sheets of pureed fruit. Fruit chips are made from crisp fruit leather
that breaks easily.

Both have tangy, concentrated fruit flavor that makes them a favorite
snack for anyone, especially handy to pack in a lunch or rucksack.
Much of the following information about making purees, fruit leathers
and chips and the individual recipes are excerpted and adapted from
University of Alaska Cooperative Extension Service Bulletin P-228,
"Fruit Leather"

PUREE: To make berry purees, rinse berries, drain, put in a blender
and blend until the consistency of thick puree. Most berries do not
need to be cooked. Salmonberries and highbush cranberries have larger
seeds and should be put through a sieve after blending to remove
seeds.

Spread puree onto oiled sheets, dehydrate until leathery for berry
leather, or crisp for berry chips.  Store in airtight container.
