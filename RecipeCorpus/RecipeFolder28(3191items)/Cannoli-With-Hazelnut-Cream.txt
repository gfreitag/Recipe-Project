1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Scatter hazelnuts on a baking sheet and
toast 15 to 18 mins, or until nuts are lightly browned and skins are
cracked. Remove as much of brown skins as possible by rubbing nuts in
a kitchen towel. Crack nuts into coarse pieces by enclosing in a
clean kitchen towel and hitting gently with a rolling pin.

2. In a medium bowl, whip cream with an electric mixer 2 to 3 mins, or
until thick. Briefly beat in granulated sugar and vanilla. Fold in
hazelnuts and pistachios. Stuff cannoli shells with nut cream. Serve
topped with a light sifting of confectioners' sugar.
