1 ts Chopped fresh rosemary OR
-1/2 teaspoon dried
3 cn Garbanzo beans (chick peas)
-(15 to 16 oz cans)
2 c  Canned chicken broth OR beef

Heat the oil in a heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and
add the turkey sausage and chopped garlic.  Saute until the sausage
is golden brown and cooked through, breaking up the sausage with the
back of a fork, about 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium and add
the tomatoes with their juices, jalapeno chili, ground cumin and
chopped fresh rosemary; simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add the garbanzo beans with their liquid and the broth.  Bring to a
boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the soup for 15 minutes.  Stir
in the lemon juice and season the soup with salt and pepper.  (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat
before continuing.)

Ladle the soup into individual bowls.  Sprinkle with chopped fresh
cilantro and top with sliced avocado.  Serve immediately.

NOTE:  "Sliced or diced fresh avocado makes a colorful garnish for
this hearty southwestern soup.  If you want to cut up the avocado
ahead of time but don't want it to discolor, simply place the avocado
pieces in a colander and rinse them with cold water.  They will stay
bright green for about two hours."

Makes 6 servings.
