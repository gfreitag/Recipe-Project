A family recipe from Bonnie Stern (cooking school teacher and
columnist in the Toronto. "Haroset is the fruit and nut paste that is
eaten at Seders to symbolize the mortar which our ancestors used to
do the pharoah's labour. My cousin Bibs Soles learned to make this
her father-in-law, my late uncle mike. He never used to measure the
ingredeints and neither does she.."

Peel and core apples. cut in quarters. Chop in food processor until
finely grated. Transfer to a bowl and stir in lemon juice, if using.
Add nuts to food processor and chop until finely chopped but with a
few little chunks of nuts. Stir into apples. Add wine slowly - a few
tablespoons at a time - until the mixture looks like a paste. (If you
make this ahead, you will probably have to add more wine as mixture
thickens slightly on standing.)
