1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Bring milk, water, and salt to a boil in a
large saucepan over high heat. Stir polenta into boiling liquid in a
slow steady stream. Reduce heat to medium and continue stirring 5
mins, or until thickened to consistency of hot cereal.

2. Meanwhile, spread walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and
bake, tossing once or twice, until nuts are lightly browned all over,
5 to 8 mins.

3. Pour polenta into shallow soup bowls and serve with a lump of
butter, toasted walnuts, and maple syrup.

NOTES:  Great breakfast dish.
