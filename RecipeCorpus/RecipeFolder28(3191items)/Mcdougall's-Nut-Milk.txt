Title: Mcdougall's Nut Milk
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
Almonds
4 c  Water
3/4 c  Raw cashews or blanched
Place water in blender, add nuts, blend at high for 60 seconds. Keep
refrigerated, it will spoil.

According to my Wellness Encyclopedia, here's the breakdown for 3/4
cups of almonds; Calories 587 Fat 52 grams Protein 16 grams Saturated
Fat 5 grams Carbo 24 grams

That would make a 1 cup serving around 13 grams of fat, around 80%
calories from fat ((13*9)/(587/4)).
