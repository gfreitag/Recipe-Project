Categories: Main dish, Beef, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Low-sodium tomato paste
1/2 ts EACH dried thyme, marjoram,
-and basil; crumbled
Nonstick cooking spray
1/4 lb Mushrooms; sliced thin
1 tb Parsley; minced
1 1/2 lb Boneless bottom round roast
1/4 ts Black pepper

Preheat the broiler. Season the roast with the pepper. Place the meat
on the broiler pan rack and broil about 4 inches from the heat,
turning until brown on all sides--about 10 minutes. Reduce the oven
temperature to 325F.

In a heavy 4-quart Dutch oven, combine the onions, garlic, beef broth,
water, tomato paste, thyme, marjoram, and basil. Add the beef and
bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Cover tightly, transfer to the
oven, and cook for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until tender.

Slice the meat 1/4 inch thick and arrange the slices, slightly
overlapping, on a heated platter; keep warm.

Lightly coat a 10-inch skillet with the cooking spray and set over
moderate heat for 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring,
for 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in the pureed
vegetables. Spoon the sauce over the beef and sprinkle with the
parsley. Submitted By NANCY VAINE   On   10-03-94
