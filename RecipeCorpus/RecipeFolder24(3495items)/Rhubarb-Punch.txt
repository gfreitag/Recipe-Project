"My mother-in-law, Laura Cunningham Dobson, gave me this recipe in the
1950s. Laura was a teacher and musician, a good cook and a beautiful
person. We like this drink because it is so refreshing."

In saucepan, bring rhubarb and 4 cups water to a boil; reduce heat to
medium and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until
rhubarb is softened. In cheesecloth lined sieve set over bowl, strain
rhubarb for at least 2 hours or overnight. Discard pulp. Stir sugar
