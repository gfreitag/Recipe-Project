Title: Bhindi (Okra) Curry
Categories: Condiment, Curries, Indian, Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 1 batch
12 oz Okra
3 tb Mustard oil
1 md Onion; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
2    Inch piece ginger; chopped
4 oz Tomatoes
1    Green pepper; chopped
2    Chiles; chopped
1 ts Mustard seed
1 ts Coriander seed
1/2 ts Fenugreek seed
-- slightly crushed
1 ts Ground turmeric
2 ts Ground cumin
2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Heenj (asafoetida)
Wash the okra, top and tail, and cut into approximately 1/4" pieces
(or leave whole after topping and tailing if preferred).

Fry mustard, coriander and fenugreek seeds in mustard oil for 2-3
minutes (cover the pan or the mustard seeds will leap out all over
the kitchen!). Add garlic, onion and ginger; fry gently for about 10
minutes more. Make the ground spices into a paste with a little
water, add to the pan and fry for a further 10 minutes.

Add okra, tomatoes, green pepper and chiles.  Cover and simmer very
slowly until the okra is tender but not sloppy (about 15-20 minutes).

Serves 3-4 as a main course, 5-6 as a side vegetable.
