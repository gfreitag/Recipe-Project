A spicy curry does not necessarily mean that the amount of incendiary
chili is the paramount seasoning.  The Bene Israel use garlic,
ginger, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, and turmeric to produce intensity.
Coconut milk also is important to mellow and blend the whole.

1.  In a pan, heat the oil and stir-fry the onions over moderate heat
until they are golden brown.  Add the garlic, ginger, chilies,
cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon, and salt.  Continue to
stir-fry for 3 minutes more. Add the tomatoes and turmeric and mix
well for 2 minutes.

2.  Add the chicken and fresh coriander and stir for 3 minutes until
the chicken changes color.  Pour in the coconut milk and bring to a
boil. Reduce the heat to low.  Cover the pan and simmer for 40
minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is tender and the
sauce has thickened. Stir in the lemon juice.  This curry does have
ample sauce.

Serve hot with rice, salad, and cooked vegetables.  Makes 6 servings.
