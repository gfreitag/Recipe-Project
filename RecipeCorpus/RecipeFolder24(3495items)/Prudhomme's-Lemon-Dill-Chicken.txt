MMMMM--------------------MEAT AND VEGETABLES-------------------------
1 1/2 c  Defatted chicken stock;
2 c  Onions; julienned
1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice; in all
2 pk Artificial sweetener;
- (1 gram each), optional
8    Chicken breasts; boneless

TO SEASON CHICKEN: Combine seasoning mix ingredients in small bowl.
Sprinkle all surfaces of chicken evenly with 2 teaspoons seasoning
mix. Rub it in well.  Dissolve cornstarch in 1/4 cup apple juice. Set
aside.

Preheat heavy 10-inch skillet, preferably non-stick, over high heat
to 350 degrees for about 4 minutes.  Place 4 chicken breasts in
skillet. Lower heat to medium.  Brown for at least 1 minute per side.
Remove chicken. Brown 4 more.  Set all the chicken aside.

Return heat to high.  Stir in 1/2 cup stock, scraping bottom of
skillet to clear it of all browned bits.  Add onions and remaining
seasoning mix. Stir.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all liquid
evaporates. Stir in 1/4 of lemon juice.  Scrape bottom of skillet
again to clear it. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until liquid
evaporates. Add 1/2 cup apple juice. Clear bottom and side of
skillet. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until about half of the liquid
evaporates.

Stir in remaining 1 cup of stock, the 1/4 cup lemon juice and the
1/4 cup apple juice.  Bring to a boil (will take 2 to 3 minutes),
whisk in the cornstarch-apple juice mixture, and return to a boil.
Return the chicken to the skillet, lower the heat to medium, and cook
until the chicken is done all the way through, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Turn off the heat, remove the chicken, and if desired, whisk in the
artificial sweetener.

Makes 4 servings.
