If you have bought uncleaned squid, clean it as follows: Remove the
head with the tentacles from the body.  Peel the thin outer membrane
from the body.  Pull the inner cartilage from the body (This is a
single piece that looks like plastic).  Discard but save the body.
Cut the tentacles off below the eye and remove the hard pebble-like
sphere that remains inside the tentacles.  Reserve the tentacles.
Wash the body thoroughly. It should remain in a bag shape after
washing. Rub the squid with the sesame oil and salt and pepper to
taste.  Set aside while you prepare the slaw. Slaw: In a large bowl,
combine the cabbage, red pepper, and scallions. In a separate bowl,
vigorously blend all of the remaining ingredients together. Just
before serving time combine the cabbage mixture with the dressing and
mix well. This rather pungent salad is a good foil for the squid and
continues the dish's Eastern inspiration. It should be dressed as
close to dinner time as possible so the cabbage stays crisp in
contrast to the softness of the squid. Sauce: Combine all of the
ingredients, blending well. This sauce keeps 3 weeks, covered, in the
refrigerator. FINAL PREPARATION: OK, let's move on out to the grill,
with the cabbage mixture and dressing in separate bowls ready to go,
the cleaned squid in one hand and a beer in the other. Now make one
more trip back to the kitchen for the Hoisin Barbecue Sauce. (Or, if
you're really dexterous, you can balance the beer bottle under your
chin and take everything out at once. A goal to aspire to as the
summer progresses.) You should have your squid body and tentacles
oiled and slated and peppered on a plate nearby; you need to have
your Hoisin Barbecue Sauce and brush; you'll need to have some tongs;
and of course you need to have one clean, washed brick, covered with
foil. Now a brick is not generally considered a key kitchen tool but
it plays a major role here in enforcing the principle that quick,
high- temperature cooking makes for tender tasty squid.  The size of
your squid will determine how many bodies go on the grill per round.
If you have squid with 4- to 5-inch bodies, you can get 3 or 4 on at
once.  The idea here is that the squid bodies go on the grill and the
brick goes on the bodies. Over a hot fire, cook the bodies 1 1/2 to 2
minutes per side. Then remove the brick, slap a coat of Hoisin
Barbecue Sauce on the bodies use your tongs to roll them around on
the grill for 30 seconds more, then remove them.  Repeat this process
for the rest of the bodies. For the tentacles, you won't need the
brick. Just cook them for about 2 minutes, using the tongs to roll
them around on the grill, so they are evenly cooked. You are looking
for the tentacles to get brown and crispy. When both the tentacles
and bodies are cooked, brush a little more sauce on the bodies and
slice them in 1/4-inch slices so that they look like little rings.
Serve the extra Hoisin Barbecue Sauce as a dipping sauce and
encourage your guests to try the squid and slaw together. If you have
any leftovers, this dish is ideal for a cold salad, the next day. At
the end of this meal, just drop the leftover squid into the slaw. The
dressing acts as a marinade that prevents the squid from toughening
up and the next day you have a chilled grilled squid salad. From The
