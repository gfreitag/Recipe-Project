Sun dried tomatoes ARE quite expensive but  few go a long way. I
plump them by putting them in a bowl and covering them with boiling
water. Let the tomatoes stand until they have softened; drain well
and pat dry. They are now ready to to whatever you want to do with
them. One way to serve them is to marinate them in a dressing: See
above. Allow the dressing to permeate the tomatoes for 6 to 8 hours,
at room temperature and serve. You could make a puree of the tomatoes
in a food processor or blender and mix it with cream cheese or, if
you want a VERY SPECIAL TREAT, whisk about 1/2 cup with 1/2 pound
mascarpone cheese. Serve on toasted slices of Italian bread or use as
a stuffing for fresh vegetables--celery, zucchini, endive leaves,
etc. Chop some up and sprinkle over a salad or top a pizza with
slivered tomatoes. Add to eggs or quiche. There is no end to what you
can do with these and, because the flavor is so intense, you don't
need too many to achieve great results. Good luck....
