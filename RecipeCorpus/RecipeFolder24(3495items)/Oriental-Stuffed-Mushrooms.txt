2 tb Fresh lemon juice
24 lg Mushroom stemmed *
3 sl Lean bacon
1/4 c  Minced onion
4 ts Minced garlic
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Sesame seeds, toasted
* Chop stems and leave caps whole In a large saucepan, combine 6 cups
water with the lemon juice, add the mushroom caps, and bring the
liquid to a boil.  Simmer the mushroom caps for 6 mintues, transfer
tham to paper towels, and let them drain. (Blanching the mushroom
caps will prevent them from wrinkling while they are baking.) In a
skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat until it is crisp,
transfer it to paper towels, and let it drain.  Pour off all but
1-1/2 tbsp of the fat from the skillet, in the remaining fat cook the
onion, the garlic, and the mushroom stems over moderately low
heat,stirring, until the vegetables are softened, and add the soy
sauce, the sesame seeds, 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, the bacon,
crumbled, and pepper to taste. Cook the mixture, stirring, for 1
minutes, or until it is slightly dry, divide it among the mushroom
caps, mounding it, and transfer the stuffed mushrooms to a jelly-roll
pan. The mushrooms may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance
and kept covered tightly with plastic wrap and chilled.  Sprinkle the
remaining 1 tbsp bread crumbs over the mushrooms and bake the
mushrooms in the middle of a preheated 325 F oven for 7 minutes, or
until the filling is heated through. To make the filling crisper, the
cooked mushrooms may be put under a preheated broiler about 4 inches
from the heat for 1 minute. Garnish the mushrooms with the scallion.
Makes 24 stuffed mushrooms.
