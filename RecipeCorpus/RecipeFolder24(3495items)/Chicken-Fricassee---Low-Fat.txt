Title: Chicken Fricassee - Low Fat
Categories: Chicken, Low-cal/fat, Poultry
Yield: 2 servings
-recipe
1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Onion - chopped
1/2 c  Green onion - chopped
2    Clove garlic - minced
1 tb Parsley - finely chopped
1/8 ts Allspice - ground
1/4 ts Thyme
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2    Chicken - about 1 lb.,
-skinned & all fat cut away
1/2 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 c  Flour - all purpose
1    Egg white
1/4 c  Skim milk
-Country Rice (see recipe)
1/4 c  Dry brown "roux" - see
PREPARATION: Preheat the oven to 350F. Cut the chicken into pieces.
Blend the paprika and pepper with the flour. Beat the egg white with
the milk. Dip the chicken into the egg white mixture and then into
the seasoned flour. Lay the chicken in a baking pan and bake for 30
minutes, or until golden brown. While the chicken is baking, make the
Country Rice.

MAKE THE FRICASSEE GRAVY: Put the "roux" into a saucepan and blend in
the water a little at a time so there are no lumps and the sauce is
smooth. Add all remaining ingredients, cover and simmer gently for 15
to 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and add it to the pot
with the Fricassee gravy. Let all simmer for another 15 minutes, or
until the hicken is very tender and easily comes off the bones.

TO SERVE: Spoon the Chicken Fricassee onto plates and accompany with
the Country Rice.

NOTES: The chicken is even good served just out of the oven without
the Fricassee gravy. Tastes like fried! There are few dishes that
appeal to me more than a good Chicken fricassee. This dish is one of
my favorites in this book.

VARIATION: The skinned chicken breasts you buy at the grocery, or
skinless turkey breasts cut into strips, both make an excellent
Fricassee.
