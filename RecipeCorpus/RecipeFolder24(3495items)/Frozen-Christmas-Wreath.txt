cluster of 3 cranberries around inner edge of mould and freeze till

around outer edge of mould; freeze. Repeat water layer; arrange tiny
clusters of mint and single leaves face down among berry clusters to
look like holly. Freeze. Using stripper and working from top to
bottom, cut 8 evenly spaced ridges out of rind of each lemon; cut
each lemon into 8 thin rounds. Pour 1/8 inch water into mould;
arrange overlapping lemon slices all around mould. Tuck in mint
leaves, face down; freeze. Repeat pouring in water; arrange ring of
cranberries against outer edge of mould and freeze. If necessary pour
in water to top of mould; freeze. To unmould, dip ring into cold
water for 30 seconds; invert on plate and unmould. Slide into punch,
rounded side up. MAKES: 1 ring
