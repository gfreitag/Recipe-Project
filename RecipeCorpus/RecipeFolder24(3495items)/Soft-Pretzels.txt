Title: Soft Pretzels
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
4 c  Flour (plus extra)
Butter as needed
4 ts Soda
Coarse salt for sprinkling
1    Envelope yeast
1 1/4 c  Warm water
1 ts Sugar
2 ts Salt
Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 c of the water.  Then stir in an additional
cup of warm water, and the sugar.  Pour the yeast mixture into a bowl
and add the salt.  Beat in the flour to make a stiff dough.  Knead it
for 10 min or until the dough is elastic.  Place in a bowl and spread
it with butter. Cover it and let it rise for 45 min or until double
in size.  Shape the dough into sticks or twists.  Make it 1/2 the
thickness of the desired finished pretzel.

Bring 4 cups of water to boiling with the soda.  Drop in 3 pretzels
at a time.  Boil them for 1 minute or until they float.  Remove and
drain them, and place them on buttered cookie sheets.  Sprinkle them
with coarse salt. Bake the pretzels at 475 F for 12 minutes or until
golden brown.  To make them crisp, lay them on a cookie sheet and
place them in a warm oven 200 F for 2 hours.
