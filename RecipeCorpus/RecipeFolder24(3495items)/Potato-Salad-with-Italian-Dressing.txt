the heat and whisk in the garlic, mustard, basil, oregano, cayenne,
salt, pepper and olive oil.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour.

halves.  Place in a steamer basket and steam over boiling water until
tender, about 20-25 minutes.  Drain and tranfer to a bowl.  Add 4
tablespoons of the dressing and the shallot.  Refrigerate 1 to several
hours.

3. Bring a small pan of water to the boil, add the beans and time
about 5 minutes, or until tender.  Drain and plunge into ice water to
stop the cooking.  Pat dry and add to the potatoes.

4. Stir in the olives, tomatoes and basil leaves.  Add enough
dressing to coat the salad.  If making the salad ahead, refrigerate;
remove from refrigeration about 1 hour before serving.
