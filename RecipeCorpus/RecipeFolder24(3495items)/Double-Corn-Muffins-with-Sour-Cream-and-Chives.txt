1/4 c  Minced fresh chives (about 1

-stone-ground
1/4 c  Sugar

* For muffins like these, frozen corn actually yields better and more
visible results than fresh corn.

Preheat the oven to 400F.  Grease 9 cups of a muffin tin. In a large
bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, soda
and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, corn,
butter, and chives. Stir the sour cream mixture into the cornmeal
mixture until just combined; do not overmix. Spoon the batter into
the prepared muffin cups, dividing it evenly.  Bake about 25 minutes,
until the muffins are puffed, golden and crunchy.  Cool in the pan on
a rack for 5 minutes.  Serve warm.
