MMMMM-------------------------FISH STOCK------------------------------
1/2 c  Chopped celery
3    Or 4 sprigs fresh parsley
3    Or 4 sprigs fresh chervil
3    Or 4 sprigs fennel leaves
1 c  Dry white wine
2 lb Bones and heads
-- from non-oily fish
-- gills removed
6 c  ;Water
1/2 c  Chopped leeks
1/2 c  Chopped onion
To make the sauce, melt 1 tb. of the butter over low heat in a
saucepan. Add the shallots and sweat until soft.  Add the wine,
vinegar, stock and half the lavender.  Raise heat to high; cook until
liquid is reduced to 2 or 3 tb.  Remove from the heat and whisk in
the remaining butter bit by bit.  (Depending on your taste, you may
not want to add all the butter.) Strain the sauce through a fine
sieve; add remaining lavender. Season with salt and pepper.  Keep
warm.

To make the fish stock, place fish bones and water in a stock pot and
bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to a simmer,
skimming off any foam.  Add remaining stock ingredients and simmer
gently, covered, for 20 minutes.  Strain through dampened
cheesecloth; discard solids. This will yield about 6 cups.

Prepare a fire in the grill.  When the coals are covered with a fine
white ash, the fire is ready.  Rub salmon fillets with a little olive
oil and place on the grill.  Cook, basting occasionally with olive
oil, approximately 3 to 5 minutes per side.  The fish should be firm
but not dry.  Serve with the sauce on the side.

The authors write: "This sauce is equally good with broiled or poached
salmon.  It can be prepared slightly ahead and kept warm in a
bain-marie. Don't add the lavender until just before serving or the
flavor will be too strong, although the fresher the lavender, the
milder its flavor and the more you can use.  If you prefer a lighter
sauce, use less butter, as indicated."
