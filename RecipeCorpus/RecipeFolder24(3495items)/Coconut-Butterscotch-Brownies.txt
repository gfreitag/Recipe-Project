Title: Coconut Butterscotch Brownies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 16 servings
1 t  Baking powder
1/4 t  Salt
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1/2 c  Shredded coconut
6 T  Butter
1 c  Dark brown sugar
2    Eggs
1 t  Vanilla extract
2/3 c  Flour
Preheat oven to 350'F. Grease an 8" square baking pan. Combine the
butter and brown sugar in a sturdy saucepan and set over moderate
heat. Stir frequently until the mixture is bubbly and the sugar is
melted, then set aside to cool slightly.

Beat the eggs and vanilla into the butter and brown sugar mixture.
Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, then stir and toss them
together. Add to the first mixture and beat just until thoroughly
mixed. Stir in the pecans and the coconut.

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for about 30
minutes, or until the top is dry and a toothpick inserted in the
center of the brownies comes out barely clean. Remove from oven and
cool on a rack. Cut into 2" squares.
