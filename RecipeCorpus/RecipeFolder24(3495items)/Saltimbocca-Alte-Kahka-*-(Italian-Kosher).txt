Categories: Jewish, Meat, Veal, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
-piece veal
2 ea Eggs; hard-cooked; halved
4 ea Olives; green; pitted
1/2 c  Broth
2 tb Sherry
1 1/2 lb Veal; very thin (3X4"pieces)
1/4 c  Flour
2 pn Salt (or to taste)
1/4 c  Olive Oil
1 sl Corned Beef; thin; for each
DIRECTIONS:

Pound first the veal so it be good and thin. Now mix together the
flour, salt and pepper and dredge on this the veal pieces. Now you
can brown these in olive oil. Don't forget to turn over and brown on
both sides. When this is finished, put the pieces into a serving dish
and arrange them so they look like something. Now you can put on each
piece one of the thin corned beef slices. On 4 of these pieces put
half an egg, and one of the green olives you'll stick on with a
toothpick.

Now you'll put the broth in the pan you browned in and boil it
together with the sherry for 1 minute. Scrape the pan while you're
boiling so you'll mix in the little brown pieces in the broth. Pour
this sauce over the veal and put the whole dish into a medium oven to
warm up. Serve it right away, it shouldn't get cold. Serves 4 people.
If it looks good to eat, just close your eyes and start cutting.
