Add liquids to gluten flour and spices, adding a little more water if
needed. Knead into a smooth ball, and divide and stretch into 16
patties. Combine the cooking stock into a kettle. Put patties into
the kettle, cover & bring to a boil. Reduce heat and gently simmer
for 50 minutes. Either serve warm as is, or dipped into flour and
quickly pan fried in a little bit of oil to brown and crisp the
outside. For a crisper texture, cook patties by baking first, then
simmering. Place the patties on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake
in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. They will puff up and be crusty.
Prick patties with a fork and drop into the simmering stock and cook
for 30 minutes.
