Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
You can fiddle with the ingredients to your hearts content.  Roast
pork is available at Chinese markets and you could probably get it to
go at Chinese restaurants.  Or try meat from good ol' American BBQ
ribs, slivered. Or thinly sliced raw chicken.  Or thinly sliced
shrimp or scallops. Or no meat at all... Yield: 4 servings 30 won ton
filled according to won ton recipe 1 cup roast pork, sliced 1 quart
chicken and pork stock [Or either one. S.C.] 2 stalks green onions,
minced 1 teaspoon sesame oil [The dark, cooked Oriental type. S.C.]
PREPARATION:

Prepare won ton filling and wrap as in won ton recipe.  Heat stock.
COOKING: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add won ton and boil for 4
to 5 minutes.  Remove won ton with bamboo skimmer or slotted spoon
and transfer to soup bowls.  Garnish with roast pork and green
onions.  Pour heated stock over won ton.  Drizzle sesame oil over won
ton and serve. DO-AHEAD NOTES; Wrap and freeze won ton. Drop frozen
won ton directly into boiling water and boil for 5 to 6 minutes.
COMMENTS: Unless you're Chinese you probably don't know what won ton
means. "Won" means cloud and "Ton" means swallow.  Since won ton
wrappers are light and fragile as clouds, biting onto won ton is like
swallowing a cloud. From "The Chinese Village Cookbook." A practical
guide to Cantonese country cooking. Rhoda Yee, Yerba Buena Press, San
