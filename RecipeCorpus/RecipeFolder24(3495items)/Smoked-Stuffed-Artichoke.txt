Title: Smoked Stuffed Artichoke
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
3 tb White wine
3 tb Lemon juice
Salt and pepper
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 c  Ham, cooked, finely chopped
1 tb Parsley, chopped
4    Artichokes, fresh ones
-have tight leaves
2    Green onions, finely
-chopped
6 tb Olive oil
1 c  Mushrooms, finely chopped
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
Trim tops and leaves of artichokes with scissors and cut stalks
level with base.  (I would cut off the top third of the artichoke and
cut off the tips of the leaves remaining to remove "spikes".) Put
artichokes into a kettle of boiling salted water and simmer about 35
to 40 minutes or until a leaf can be pulled out easily. Drain,
refresh under cold running water, and let stand upside down until
cool.
To make the dressing:  Saute green onions slowly in 2 tablespoons
of the oil, until just tender.  Stir in mushrooms and cook 2-3
minutes; then stir in bread crumbs and cheese.  Transfer mixture to a
bowl and let stand until cool.  Stir in wine, lemon juice and
remaining oil. Season well with garlic salt, salt and pepper, then
add ham.
Prepare each artichoke by pulling out some of the center leaves
until the choke can be reached.  (I'd just cut off about the top
third of the artichoke and the choke would be reachable.)  With a
teaspoon, scrape out all the hairy choke.  Fill each artichoke with
dressing and top with parsley.  Wrap each artichoke in foil, leaving
the top open. Place on smoker grid and smoke for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
