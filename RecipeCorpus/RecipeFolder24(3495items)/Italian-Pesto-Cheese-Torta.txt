Title: Italian Pesto Cheese Torta
Categories: Italian, Herbs/spice, Appetizer
Yield: 1 torta
1 c  Toasted pine nuts
3/4 c  Pesto (see separate recipe)
1 ts Salt
1 lb Cream cheese; softened
15 oz Ricotta; drained
1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella; drained
12    Fresh basil leaves
Line a standard bread pan with a double thickness of fine-weave
cheesecloth.  Allow enough cheesecloth to fold over the top of the
mold after the cheese has been layered.  Arrange fresh basil leaves
in a decorative pattern on the cheesecloth and sprinkle on 1 to 2
tablespoons of the pine nuts.

Combine cream cheese, ricotta, mozzarella, and salt in a food
processor (or use an electric mixer) and blend until smooth.  Place
one-third of the cheese mixture in the pan nad smooth it into an even
layer. Spread half the pesto over the top and sprinkle on half the
remaining pine nuts. Repeat these layers, ending with a cheese layer.
Fold the cheesecloth over the top of the cheese and press slightly to
even up the mold. Refrigerate one to three days.

To unmold, press down on the cheesecloth to make sure that the cheese
is firmly in place.  Fold back the top of the cheesecloth and pull up
on the sides a little to loosen the mold.  Invert a serving plate
over the pan, keeping the cheesecloth away from the top of the mold.
Turn over the mold together with the plate, then lift the pan off the
cheese. Peel the cheesecloth carefully off the torta.

Variation: Substitute sun-dried tomato pesto for traditional pesto.
Arrange whole sun-dried tomatoes, sliced black olives, basil, and
pine nuts in a decorative pattern in the pan for the top of the torta.
