Title: Sweet Milk
Categories: Diabetic
Yield: 1 batch
2/3 c  Raisins
2 c  Reconstituted nonfat milk
It should be made at least one day in advance of use, but reaches peak
sweetness after two or three days. Combine milk and raisins in a jar,
cover and refrigerate at least overnight. Before using, shake the jar
vigorously. Milk should be an ivory color. Strain the milk to remove
the raisins which will be mushy and a little flat tasting. Use milk
as directed <in recipe>.
