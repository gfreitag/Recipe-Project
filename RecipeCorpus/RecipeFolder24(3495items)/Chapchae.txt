Categories: Asian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Sesame oil
3    Garlic cloves
-- peeled and minced
1 tb Japanese soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 oz Cellophane mung-bean noodles
6    Chinese black mushrooms
1/3 lb Tender spinach leaves
1    Carrot
1 sm Zucchini
3 md Mushrooms
2    Chinese cabbage leaves
4    Scallions
Soak the Chinese mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for 20 minutes.  When
they have softened, cut off the hard stems and slice the caps fine.

Drop the spinach into 10 cups of boiling water.  Boil rapidly for 2
minutes.  Drain.  Run under cold water.  Squeeze out as much moisture
as possible.

Peel the carrot, cut into 3 sections and then into fine julienne
strips.

Wipe off the fresh mushrooms and break off their stems.  Cut the caps
into very fine slices.  Cut the nonwoody part of the stems into
matchstick pieces.

Cut away and discard the curly, tender part of the cabbage leaves.
Save only the V-shaped core of the leaves.  Cut this into julienne
strips.

Cut the scallions into 2-1/2-inch sections.  Quarter the section with
the bulb lengthwise.

Combine the Chinese mushrooms, spinach, carrot, zucchini, mushrooms,
cabbage, and scallions in a bowl.  Mix well, separating all the
spinach leaves.

Heat the vegetable oil and the sesame oil in a wok or a 10-inch saute
pan over a medium-high flame.  When hot, put in the garlic.  Stir and
fry for 10 seconds.  Add all the vegetables in the bowl.  Stir and
fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Turn
the heat to low. Add the drained noodles, soy sauce, and salt. Stir
well, distributing the noodles evenly, and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Taste
for seasonings.
