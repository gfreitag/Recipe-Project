Title: Raspberry Vinegar 2
Categories: Dressing, Salsa/sauce, Salad
Yield: 1 servings
Sugar
1 qt Vinegar (type?)
2 qt Raspberries
To each quart of good vinegar, add two quarts of raspberries. Let
stand for 24 hours then drain the vinegar off through a sieve. Do not
squeeze them. Add the same quantity of raspberries again to the
strained vinegar, letting stand as before for 24 hours. Strain as
before and add a third quantit. When you have strained the fruit off
a third time, measure the liquor into a stone covered-jar.  To each
pint of vinegar, add a pound of lump sugar. Set the jar in a pot of
boiling water, and let the vinegar boil for ten minutes, stirring it
to mix the sugar well through;when cold, bottle it for use. It is all
the better for standing for some months before being used.

A cheaper sort might be made with fine moist sugar, or with crushed
sugar, but must be well scummed.  Raspberry vinegar makes an
excellent fever drink, a small quantity being mixed in a tumbler of
cold water. It is very refreshing in hot weather, and is made in
considerable quantities by those who have wild raspberries growing
near the clearings, and plenty of sugar at command.
