Title: Baked Doughnuts
Categories: Dessert, Bread
Yield: 2 dozen
2 ts Nutmeg
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
4 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Melted butter
1 c  Sugar mixed w/1 tsp cinamon
2 pk Dry yeast
1/3 c  Warm water
1 1/2 c  Milk
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let it
dissolve for 5 minutes. Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and
heat until the shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm.

2. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk
mix. Stif in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs and 2 cups flour.
Beat briskly until well blended. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour
and beat until smooth. Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1
hour.

3. Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto
it. This dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent
sticking, but is easy to handle. Pat the dough into a round about 1/2
inch thick. Use a 3 inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts,
placing them (and the doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1
inch apart. These don't spread much; they rise. Preheat oven to 450F.
Let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered. Bake about
10 minutes or a little longer, until they have a touch of golden
brown. Remove from the oven. Have ready the melted butter and a
brush. On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar. Brush each
doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon
sugar. Serve hot.
