Title: Halloween Soup in a Pumpkin
Categories: Soup/stew, Holiday
Yield: 8 servings
2 qt Chicken stock
Salt & pepper
1/2 ts Sage; (or more)
1 c  Cream, heavy;  OR
1 c  Half and Half
Parsley; chopped
6 lb Pumpkin; (6-7lb)
2 1/2 c  Bread crumbs, fresh dried
2 c  Onions; chopped
1/2 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Cheese, mozzarella or swiss;

Crush bread crumbs.  Saute onions in butter until soft but not
browned. Stir crumbs into the hot onion mixture and cook slowly for 3
minutes. Cut a top off pumpkin, scoop out seeds, rub inside with soft
butter. Turn the crumb mix into the pumpkin. Stir in grated
mozzarella or swiss cheese and fill to within 2 inches of top with
hot chicken stock (about 2 qt). Season with salt, pepper and sage.

Bake on a pizza pan in preheated 400 degree oven for about 1 1/2
hours or until pumpkin flesh can be flaked off with large cooking
fork. Do not overcook as pumpkin will collapse.  Keep warm until
ready to serve. Just before serving, gently stir in hot cream or half
and half, and a handful of chopped fresh parsley.  Check seasoning,
correct. Ladle soup into hot bowls, scraping off some of the pumpkin
flesh as you do. Get some of the flesh into each bowl as you serve.
