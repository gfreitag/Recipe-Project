Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Irish Soda Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 2 round loaf
MMMMM----------------------FRUIT AND SEEDS---------------------------
4 t  Caraway seeds
3/4 c  Raisins
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 1/2 t  Baking powder
3/4 t  Salt
3/4 c  Cold butter
5 c  Unbleached white flour
1 t  Baking soda
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
2    Eggs
6 T  Fruit Sweetener
1 1/3 c  Buttermilk
Begin by plumping the raisins. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil and add
the raisins. When the water returns to a boil, turn off the heat. Let
the raisins plump in the water for at least 10 minutes. Drain the
raisins, saving any raising water for another use. Set raisins aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray a baking sheet with
lecithin spray, or line it with baking paper. Cut the cold butter
into 1/2 inch pieces. Sift the dry ingredients together into a medium
size bowl or the mixing bowl for your electric mixer. With the mixer
on its lowest speed, use the paddle attachment or your beaters to cut
the cold butter into the dry ingredients, until the mixture resembles
coarse cornmeal. Stir in the plumped raisins and the caraway seeds.
In a small bowl, whisk together the sweetener, buttermilk and eggs
and add to the flour mixture. Stir together on medium low speed just
until mixed.

Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into 2
equal portions. Knead each portion 8-10 times, and form into a round
loaf, 8 inches in diameter. Place the loaves on the prepared baking
pan. Use a serrated knife to cut a 1/2 inch deep cross on the top of
each loaf. Place the loaves on the middle shelf in the preheated
oven, and bake for 40 to 50 minutes until golden brown and crusty.

Remove the loaves to a wire rack to cool. Irish Soda Bread is
wonderful served hot from the oven.
