Categories: Information
Yield: 1 servings
1    Spaghetti squash
The flesh of spaghetti squash, when cooked, comes out like strands of
cooked spaghetti and makes a great light stand-in for pasta lovers.

Prepare squash by cutting in half lengthwise and removing seeds.
Pierce skin several times with a fork and follow one of the cooking
methods below.

To bake, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a large baking
pan. Bake at 350 oF for 45 minutes or until skin is tender and
strands may be loosened easily with a fork.

To microwave, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a baking
dish. Add 1/4 cup water; cover with plastic wrap, folding back a
small edge of wrap to allow steam to escape. Cook on HIGH 7 to 10
minutes.

To boil, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a Dutch oven,
add water to a depth of 2 inches. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce
heat, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes or until tender. Drain.

Cool cooked squash. Using a fork, remove spaghetti-like strands of
pulp. Discard shell.

Yield: 1 medium spaghetti squash equals about 4 cups cooked.
