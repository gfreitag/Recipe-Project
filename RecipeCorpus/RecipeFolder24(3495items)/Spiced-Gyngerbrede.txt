George Washington's mother's recipe uses no ginger. Fruit juice or
coffee may be substituted for brandy.

Cream shortening and orange rind together. Add brown sugar gradually
and cream thoroughly. Blend in well beaten eggs. Beat hard for 1-2
minutes to make a smooth batter. Sift flour, soda, salt and spices
together and add to creamed mixture alternately with the molasses and
mix of orange juice/brandy. Add raisins. Pour in well greased and
floured 8" X 12" X 2-1/2" pan. bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
