James Beard's Corn Bread

Makes: 6 servings

Preheat the oven to 400dF. Butter an 8-1/2x11 inch baking pan.

Sift the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder into a large bowl, to
mix the ingredients thoroughly and distribute the baking powder
evenly.

Beat in the eggs and milk using a wooden spoon until well mixed. Beat
in the cream and, lastly, the melted butter.

Pour into the buttered pan and bake for 18 to 20 minutes.

While still hot, cut into squares and serve wrapped in a napkin.

"There are innumerable recipes for corn bread, which is leavened by
baking powder. This one, which is very moist and rich, happens to be
my favorite."  James Beard
