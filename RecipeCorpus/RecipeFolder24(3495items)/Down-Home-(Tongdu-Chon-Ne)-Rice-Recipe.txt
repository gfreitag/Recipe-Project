Title: Down Home (Tongdu Chon Ne) Rice Recipe
Categories: Asian, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
Salt
Rice
Water
"This is how all the cooks in the town of TongDu Chon Ne, north of
Seoul; Korea, cook their rice.  It works every time.  It works the
same for women and men.  Children's hands are a little too small to
do this."

In your standard rice pot add

Short or Middle Grain Rice  | Add rice until it comes up to the (No
long grain rice please) | top of your fingernail, stuck in the rice
| Water | Add water until it comes up to
the first
| knuckle of the finger. Salt to taste.
| or so) | Set on med. high until the water comes to
(1/2 tsp
| a boil, stir and turn heat to low.
Cover.
| After 10 min. check. When steam holes
appear
| the rice is done. Do not stir.

NOTE:  The key is the right height of the water over the rice.  You
can't have the rice too deep or it gets sticky.  If you need more
rice, use a larger pan.  We have one pan that makes just enough for
one meal. It also is the exact size for one bowl of popcorn..  but
that is another story. If you have artificial or just long nails,
don't do this. I always use my first finger.
