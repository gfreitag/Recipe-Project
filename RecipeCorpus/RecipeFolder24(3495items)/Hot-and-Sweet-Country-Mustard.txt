-buy one like

-good.  Mustards like this
1/2 cup dry mustard 1/2 cup flour 1/2 cup sugar pinch of salt 1/4 cup
cider vinegar

Combine the dry mustard, flour, sugar and salt, then slowly stir in
the cider vinegar.  Don't taste it now, because it will be horrible,
but in 3 to 4 days it will have mellowed and become superb. Keeps
indefinitely in a cool place. Makes a bit less than 1 cup
