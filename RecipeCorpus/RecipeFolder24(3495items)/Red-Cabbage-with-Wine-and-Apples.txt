1 t  Coarse salt; kosher type
1 1/3 c  Meat stock; or canned beef
3 T  Red currant jelly
2 ea Red cabbage; medium heads,

1.  Quarter and core the cabbages.  Wash, drain and cut into 1/4-inch
shreds.  In a large, heavy nonreactive casserole, melt the butter over
moderately low heat.  Stir in the brown sugar and cook, stirring,
until melted.  Add the onions and apples.  Cover tightly and cook
over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring twice. 2. Add the shredded
cabbage and toss to coat lightly.  Pour the vinegar over the cabbage
and stir to mix. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. 3. Sprinkle the salt
over the cabbage and add the wine and 1 cup of the stock. Cover and
simmer over moderately low heat until the cabbage is very tender,
1-1/2 to 2 hours, adding more stock as necessary to keep the cabbage
fairly moist but never soupy.  Add the currant jelly and stir until
melted.  Remove from the heat and serve hot. (The cabbage can be made
up to 2 days ahead.  Let cool completely, then cover and refrigerate.
Let return to room temperature before reheating.) Serves 8. Recipe
