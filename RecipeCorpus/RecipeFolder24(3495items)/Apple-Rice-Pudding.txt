Categories: Diabetic, Dessert, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1    Apple, shredded peel on
1/4 ts Ascorbic acid col. keeper
2 c  Cooked rice
1 c  Skim milk
1 tb Liquid Sugartwin (1/4 c sug)
1/4 c  Raisins
1 ts Vanilla
1 tbsp Sugartwin has the sweetness of 4 tbsp or 1/4 cup sugar.
American Diabetes Assoc. guidelines allow 1 tsp sugar per serving or
2 tbsp for a 6 serving recipe which would taste OK to people
accustomed to low sugar recipes.

Combine rice, milk, sweetener (or sugar) raisins, vanilla and spices.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and stir occasionally until the mixture
is creamy.

Core and shred apple and sprinkle with ascorbic acid color keeper, or
with a little lemon juice.  Stir apple into rice mixture.  Cook a few
minutes longer until apple is soft.  Serve warm or cold.

1/6 recipe made with artificial sweetner - 1 starch choice, 1 milk

Optional:  Cook 2/3 cup rice in 1 2/3 cups water.  Make pudding as
above without apple and add 2 tbsp coconut.
