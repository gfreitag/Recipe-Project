lf you like the convenience oE liquid pump soaps, but not the
exorbitant prices, make your own. This formula makes a thick, creamy
liquid soap. Place soap in the bowl, stir in water, and mix. *add oil
and blend well. Pour into the pump bottle. Since the soap does tend
to separate, shake it occasionally before using. Adding oil helps
keep the mixture from drying up. Variation: To make a scented soap,
add a few drops of an essential oil, such as rose oil. Source:
