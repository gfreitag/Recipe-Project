Title: Mexican Chocolate Ice Cream
Categories: Tex/mexican, Chocolate, Dessert, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 batch
3/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
1 c  Lightly toasted and ground
-- blanched almonds
5 oz Semisweet chocolate
-- coarsely chopped
1 ts Chile piquin flakes
3 c  Half-and-half
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
12    Egg yolks; beaten
3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
7 oz Semisweet chocolate
2 tb Instant coffee powder
3 tb Ground cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 2 cups of the half-and-half
and the brown sugar; heat until sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat
and whisk 1/3 c. of the half-and-half/sugar mixture into the egg
yolks, then return the half-and-half to the stove and add the yolk
mixture, stirring constantly. Cook, continuing to stir, until the
custard coats a spoon or reaches 170 F. Remove from heat and strain
into a bowl. Set aside.

Melt the chocolates and coffee together in a double boiler, being
careful that the mixture does not burn.  Scrape the melted chocolate
mixture into a food processor; add the remaining half-and-half,
cinnamon and confectioners' sugar.  Process until smooth, then
gradually whisk the chocolate mixture into the custard.  Chill for 1
hour, then freeze in an ice cream machine, according to
manufacturer's instructions. When frozen, the texture will be creamy
rather than firm. Fold in the toasted almonds, ground chocolate and
chile flakes. Return to freezer until ready to serve.

Yield: Approximately 1 quart.
