Recommended Equipment: **********************

"Why don't my pies, cakes, muffins, or cookies look like the ones
from the bakery?" Once of the answers is equipment. When you use
specialized equipment the results are more professional and the whole
baking process is more efficient and convenient. For example: high
domed muffin tops or perfectly round cookies are the result of using
ice bream scoops for forming them; an electric knife cuts crisp,
clean pieces of cake, it even cuts through raisins and nuts; and an
oven thermometer means that you don't ahve to burn a cake to realize
that your oven bakes too hot; a free standing mixer frees you to make
bread at the same time that you chop the vegetables for the soup; a
piece of baking parchment lining the pan means that you no longer
have to grease and flour; and an electric mixer of any kind gives
greater volume to egg whites than you can achieve by using a whisk.

While special equipment is more efficient, it is not essential. I've
rolled out pie crust using a mason jar turned on its side, and I've
cut out biscuits with a blue plastic glass. I've cut up cardboard
boxes to make cardboard cake rounds, and yes, I've even used that
special tool on my pocket knife to open a can. None of these was the
most efficient or professional method, although in some cases it was
the only means to the desired end - and considering the
circumstances, the results were perfect.

So please know that you can have acceptable results improvising with
the equipment you now have. Then, as you become more serious about
baking, you can upgrade your equipment along the following
guidelines, beginning with a few basics and proceeding to the
optional items. Always purchase the best equipment and tools you can
afford, preferably professional, commercial quality items.
