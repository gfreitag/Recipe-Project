Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Water
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Margarine or butter
2    Eggs
2 tb Sesame seed (opt)
4 1/2 c  Flour (to 5 1/4c)
1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 pk Yeast
Filling: 4 oz. (1 c) shredded mozzarella 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp garlic powder 1/4 cup margarine or butter, softened

Generously grease 12-cup fluted tube or 10-inch tube pan; sprinkle
with sesame seed.  In large bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups flour, sugar,
salt and yeast; blend well.  In small saucepan, heat water, milk and
1/2 cup margarine until very warm (120 to 130 F).  Add warm liquid
and eggs to flour mixture.  Blend at low speed until moistened; beat
3 minutes at medium speed.  By hand, stir in 2 to 2 3/4 cups flour to
form stiff batter. In small bowl, combine all filling ingredients;
mix well. Spoon half of batter into prepared pan; spoon filling
evenly over batter to within 1/2 inch of sides of pan. Spoon
remaining batter over filling. Cover; let rise in warm place (80 to
85 F) until light and doubled in size, about 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and
bread sounds hollow when lightly tapped.  Remove from pan
immediately; serve warm or cool.
