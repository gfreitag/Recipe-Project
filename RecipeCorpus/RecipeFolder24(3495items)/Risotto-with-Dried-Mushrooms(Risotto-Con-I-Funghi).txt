Prepare chicken broth.  If using dried mushrooms, soak in warm water
20 minutes.  Drain mushrooms, reserving liquid.  Strain mushroom
liquid. Rinse mushrooms under cold running water.  Squeeze to remove
as much moisture as possible.  If using fresh mushrooms, saute in 2
Tbsp butter until golden; set aside.  Heat broth in a medium
saucepan. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan.  When butter
foams, add onion. Saute over medium heat until pale yellow.  Add rice
and mix well. When rice is coated with butter, add wine. Cook
stirring constantly, until wine has evaporated. Add drained dried
mushrooms and reserved mushroom liquid. Stir in 1 or 2 ladles of
broth, or enough to cover rice.  Stir over medium heat until broth
has been absorbed. Continue cooking and stirring rice, adding broth a
little at a time until rice is done, 15 to 20 minutes.  Rice should
be tender, but firm to the bite.  Stir in Parmesan cheese, 1 Tbsp
butter and sauteed fresh mushrooms, if using.  Season with salt.
Place in a warm dish. Serve immediately.
