2 x  Green onions chopped
4 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 c  Water

Mix flour and water.  Add more water a teaspoon at a time until

Wrap in plastic wrap, and set aside for 20 minutes.
Brown and drain ground beef of all fat.  Wash and dry fresh

remaining ingredients. Mix well.
Form dough into a long roll 1 inch in diameter. Cut or break into
1 inch sections.  With your hands or a large glass, flatten each
piece into a circle 3 inches in diameter. Place 1 TABLESPOON of

press to seal. Brush a nonstick frying pan with 1/2 teaspoon oil.
Place the dumplings in the pan and brown them on each side.
Add enough broth or water to come up to a third of the height of the
dumplingsl  Cover pan tightly, and steam until water is all gone -
about 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the dumplings hot or cold with sherry
or vinegar for dipping.
