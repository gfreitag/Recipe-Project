Review by kjb2@postoffice.mail.cornell.edu (Kathy Brese): "I made
this one and IMHO it was pretty awful!  I really didn't like the
flavor of the ginger with the garbanzos.  I think my tastebuds
expected cumin, not ginger.  I did let it sit a few days to see if it
needed time to mellow, but it still tasted yucky to me." From:
"Anne.Cox" <20676AC@msu.edu> "I agree! We didn't like the
ginger-garbanzo combo at all, and it got worse and worse as it aged
in the fridge...the raccoons climbed into the compost to eat it,
though. I didn't like the mushroom dip/puree thing at all, either."
