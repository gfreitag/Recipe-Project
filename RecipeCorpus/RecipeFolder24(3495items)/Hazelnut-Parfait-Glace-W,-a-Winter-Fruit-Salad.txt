To Finish and Serve: Toast the hazelnuts in a med. oven until lightly

lightly oiled aluminium foil to harden. Unmould and slice the
parfait, arrange the salad around each slice and pour the syrup over
and around the dessert. Garnish with hazelnuts. * Sugar Syrup is made

passionate about food and think intelligently before cooking." Damien
describes the style of his cooking as modern French. "It is often
difficult to reproduce truly French flavours outside of France.
Australia offers superb raw materials and by asing our cooking on
French classical and regional techniques, mindful of the Australian
palate, we are able to produce a disstinctive style of cuisine."
