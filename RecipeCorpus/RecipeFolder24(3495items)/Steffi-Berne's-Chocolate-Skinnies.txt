Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 5 dz cookies
-(6 ounces)
1/3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
1 ts Instant good-quality
-espresso; dissolved in 1 ts
;hot water
1    Extra-large egg; lightly
;beaten
1 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
1/2 ts Baking soda
pn Salt
8 tb Salted butter (1 stick); cut
;into small pieces
6 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
;broken into small pieces
-OR-
1 c  -Semisweet chocolate morsels
Position two oven racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat
the oven to 350F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum
foil.

Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt, and set aside.

Combine the butter, chocolate, sugar, and corn syrup in a heavy
medium-size saucepan and stir over low heat until almost all the
chocolate is melted. Remove the pan from the heat and stir vigorously
until smooth. Let cool for 5 minutes. Stir in the dissolved coffee
and the egg. Add the dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly
combined.

Using a measuring spoon and a tiny rubber spatula, drop level
teaspoonfuls about 2 1/2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.

Bake 2 baking sheets at a time for 2 minutes, rotating the sheets
from top to bottom and from front to back after the cookies puff up
and then settle down (about halfway through the baking time). These
cookies should be crisp, but they tend to burn if baked too long.
Slide the paper with the cookies onto a flat surface and let the
cookies cool for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire
rack to cool completely. If the cookies are not crisp when cool, they
can be returned to the oven for a minute or so. Store in a cookie jar
with a loose-fitting lid.
