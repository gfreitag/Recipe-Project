checked. Guessed about 16 half-inch slices per loaf to make 32
servings.

Stir together 2 cups of flour and the salt in a large bowl.  Heat the
milk, margarine and sugar together over low heat until the margarine
is soft. Add the liquid to the flour.  Beat for 2 minutes on the
medium speed of an electric mixer or 300 strokes by hand.

Combine 1 cup of flour and the yeast.  Add to the batter.  Beat for 2
minutes on medium speed or 300 strokes by hand.  Stir in the oats and
caraway with a wooden spoon.  Stir in enough additional flour to make
a stiff dough.

Turn out onto a floured board.  Knead until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes.
Place in a greased large bowl.  Brush the top with vegetable oil.
Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until
double in size, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down.  Divide it in half and shape to form two loaves.
Place in two greased 8 1/2 " x 4 1/2 " loaf pans.  Brush with melted
margarine or butter.  Cover and let rise until nearly double in size,
about 1 hour.  When almost doubled, preheat the oven to 375 F.  Bake
for about 40 minutes or until brown.  Cool before slicing.  Makes 2
loaves.
