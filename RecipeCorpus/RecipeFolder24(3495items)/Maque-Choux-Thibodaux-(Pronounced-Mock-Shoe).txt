Oz can of stock)
1/2 c  Apple juice
1/2 c  Prune juice (or one 5.5
Oz can)
1    Red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 c  Evaporated skim milk (or 1/2
c  Mixed double strength from

1/4 c  Non-fat milk powder
1 x  * * * * Seasoning Mix * *
1 1/2 t  Onion powder
1 t  Salt  (omit if canned stock

1/4 t  White pepper (I didn't have
Any)
1 x  * * * * Ingredients * * *
2 c  Chopped onion, in all
1 c  Chopped celery, in all
1) Combine seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl 2) Combine 1 cup
onions, 1/2 cup celery and 2 cups corn in a blender (or food
processor) with 1/2 cup stock. Puree until completely smooth. 3)
Place the pureed mixture in a hot skillet and cook scraping
periodically for 12 to 13 minutes.  Prudhomme says this is the most
important step in developing the flavor.  Cook a few minutes until a
crust forms, scrape of the crust in and mix well.  Allow another
crust to form, blend in and repeat until the mixture is very thick
and dark brown. 4) At the end of 12 minutes or so, add apple and
prune juice, remaining vegetables, seasoning mix and stock. Scrape to
clear bottom of skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook 35
minutes, checking bottom of skillet for sticking (expecially near the
end) 5) Combine dry milk powder and evaporated milk until
compleletely dissolved.  Add to skillet while stirring, bring to a
simmer and cook 5 minutes.

Prudhomme says to use the freshest and sweetest corn available.  This
time of year I figured  frozen corn would be better than fresh, so I
used Green Giant Extra Sweet, which was actually a little too sweet.
I think it was one of those new hybrids that are  super sweet and
also extra crispy. To make it again I'd use half extra sweet and half
regular.  I also threw in the last of a can of golden hominy, which
actually made a nice contrast in taste and texture, so actually next
time I might end up with three kinds of corn in it -- how's that for
gourmet cooking!  The red bell pepper was my idea, since I thought
the color would be a nice touch.  Tastes wonderful. I bought the tiny
cans of prune juice since I figured I wouldn't be able to use up a
big jar. I also just used dry milk made up double concentrated
instead of evaporated milk.
