Categories: Meat, Diabetic
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Oregano

The two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat.

Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt,
thyme, oregano, pepper and cloves.  Mix until thoroughly combined.

Divide into 12 portions.  Form each into a sausage-shaped roll or flat
patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easy.)  Place in a
cold, lightly oiled frypan.

Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.

Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap.  Store in
refrigerator up to 5 days or in freezer up to 2 months.  Or cook a
second time and serve immediately.

To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook
over medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages
are brown and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner,
allowing about 2 min longer for cooking.

Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the
frying pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the
fat and blot with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in a baking
dish (try 8" pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top
with about 2 1/4 cups seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until
crumbs are lightly browned.
