4 ea Generous slices of fresh
-ginger, chopped finely
2 ea Or 3 tablespoons honey
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
4 T  Butter
2 ea Loins of lamb, bones removed
3 T  Oil
Leaves from 2 sprigs of
-fresh thyme
Leaves from 2 sprigs of
-fresh rosemary
g  Rind of 1/2 lemon
Juice of 1 lemon
4 ea Cloves of garlic, skins
-removed and crushed
Put into your blender or food processor, the thyme, rosemary, lemon
rind and juice, garlic, ginger, honey, salt and pepper and blend
thoroughly to a puree.  Reserve 1 tablespoon of this mixture.  Add
butter and continue to blend.  Reserve 2 tablespoons of this mixture.
Generously spread the herbed butter inside the lamb loins.  Roll up
and stitch together, using a very fine twine, and a darning needle.
Add the oil to the reserved lemon herb mixture (without the butter).
Score the loins and rub the mixture well into the meat.  Put in a
china dish and pour over any mixture not adhering to the meat. Cover
with plastic and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight if
possible. Turn the loins in the oil mixture occasionally. Preheat the
oven to 230'C and cook the lamb on the centre shelf for approximately
20 minutes, according to desired pinkness.  Cook for a further 15
minutes on the barbecue or under a griller to brown and crisp the
outside.  Carve into 2 cm to 3 cm slices and serve with the melted
reserved herb butter mixture.  Sandra Nicholas Bon-Appetit,
