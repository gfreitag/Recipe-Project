Title: Gnocchi Di Patate
Categories: Italian, Potato, Pasta, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 lg Egg
1/2 c  Flour (approx)
4 lb Baking potatoes
1 1/2 t  Salt
Boil the potatoes in salted water until they are really cooked. Drain
thorougly, peel, put them back in their pot and mash them to an even,
smooth consistency.  When they are tepid, beat in the egg. Then
slowly add the flour by sifting in a bit at a time and mixing well
each time. Since the amount of flour you need is dictated by the
quality of the potatoes and how much they can absorb, you may want to
use a little more or little less flour in order to achieve a workable
dough that is both elastic and smooth. Turn out the dough on a
floured surface and cut it into egg-sized pieces. Roll these pieces
with the palm of your hand until they become finger-sized rolls about
like an ordinary breadstick. Cut the rolls into 1" of 1 1/2" lengths.
Shake each piece in you hand as you would dice before rolling, and
cast them on the lightly floured surface. The pieces are now gnocchi
waiting for a finishing touch, and you have a choice of: 1) pressing
the center of each gnoccho with your finger, making a single dent; or
2) rolling each gnoccho over the surface of a grater so that it's
covered with many tiny indentations.  Both systems are valid, the
purpose being to give the gnocchi the best possible surface for a
coating of sauce. Once all the gnocchi are rolled and dented, let
them rest while you put 6 quarts of water on to boil.  When it boils,
salt it with 6 t of salt. Once it reaches a second rolling boil, add
the gnocchi a few at a time. They are cooked as soon as they surface,
and should be scooped out with a slotted spoon, drained well, and put
in a warm serving dish. Continue the operation until all are cooked.
Serve with "Manzo In Umido" (see recipe) or "Burro e Parmigiano" (see
recipe) sauce. From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco
