Put periwinkles in a large pot with 2 cm of water.  Cook for 3 to 5
minutes.  Allow to cool slightly.  Remove periwinkles from shell with
lobster spike or crochet hook.  Cut off first part of the snail and
discard, as it is very tough.  Take 48 porcelain snail pots, place
the tail of a periwinkle in each one and fill the pot with garlic
butter. Top each small container with a round of puff pastry cut
slightly larger than the top of the pot.  Glaze with egg wash. It you
do not wish to use puff pastry just sprinkle the top with
breadcrumbs. Place prepared pots on a baking tray and cook in a
pre-heated 220'C oven for 14 minutes. Susan and Jean Jacques Lale
