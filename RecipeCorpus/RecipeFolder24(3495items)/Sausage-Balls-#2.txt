Title: Sausage Balls #2
Categories: Pork, Appetizer
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Cheddar cheese
1 lb Sausage meat
2 c  Bisquick powder
Grate the cheese and allow it to come to room temperature (or grate
it at room temperature).  Mix (by hand, or with a fork or spoon) with
the Bisquick powder and the sausage meat (crumbled).  Form into
bite-sized balls, around 3/4" in diameter.  Cook on foil or a baking
pan at 325 F for about 20 minutes.

I think I was also told that these store very well, but I'm not
positive about that.
