1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 tb Water if dough is dry
1/4 c  Chopped walnuts
1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 c  Vegetable oil

1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
Beat together the oil, sugar, and egg.  Add the rest of the
ingredients and stir to blend well.  Let stand for 10 minutes.  Drop
by spoonfuls, about 1 inch apart, onto a lightly oiled baking sheet.
Bake for about 8 minutes at about 375 F.

My note:  Temperature and water are not in the printed version of this
recipe but come from the previous recipe Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip
Cookies.  They did not need to bake as long as 12-15 min.
