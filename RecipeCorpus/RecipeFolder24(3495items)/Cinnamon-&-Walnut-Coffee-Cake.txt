MMMMM------------------------CAKE BATTER-----------------------------
1/4 c  Firmly-packed light brown
-sugar
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
2    Extra-large eggs
1 c  Sour cream blended with 3/4
-ts baking soda
1/4 c  Chopped walnuts
1 1/2 c  Unsifted cake flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground cardamom
8 tb Unsalted butter, softened
3/4 c  Sugar
MMMMM----------------CINNAMON-SUGAR-WALNUT "SAND---------------------
-sugar
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Ground walnuts
1 tb Ground cinnamon
1/4 c  Firmly packed light brown
Preheat oven to 350xF. Lightly butter and flour a 9"x9"x2" baking
pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon
and cardamom.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter on moderate
speed for 3-5 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar, and
beat for 3 minutes. Blend in the vanilla. Beat in the eggs, one at at
time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. On low speed,
alternately add the sifted mixture in 3 additions with the sour cream
in 2 additions, befinning and ending with the sifted mixture. Stir in
the walnuts.

Stir together all the ingredients for the cinnamon-sugar-walnut
"sand."

Spoon half the batter into the baking pan. Sprinkle over about 1/3 of
the "sand." Spoon over the remaining batter. Sprinkle the remaining
"sand" on top of the batter. Bake the cake for 35-40 minutes, or
until a wooden pick withdraws from the center of the cake without any
clinging particles of unbaked batter.

Cool the cake in the pan on a rack. If serving warm, cut squares of
the warm cake directly from the pan. Otherwise, after 5 minutes of
cooling, invert the cake onto another cooling rack, then invert again
to cool right-side-up.

NOTE: This simple recipe, a fairly standard sour-cream batter, has
been in my file for a long time. The batter is silky smooth and can
handle many other additions, such as sliced ripe fruit (peaches,
nectarines, plums) or berries (raspberries, blueberries). A sandy
mixture of granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and ground walnuts
becomes both a filling and a topping for the cake. It is at its most
agreeable best when eaten slightly warm, for that is when the full
aroma of the nuts and cinnamon comes forth.
