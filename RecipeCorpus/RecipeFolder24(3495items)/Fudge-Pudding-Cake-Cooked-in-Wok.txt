Title: Fudge Pudding Cake Cooked in Wok
Categories: Stir fry, Dessert, Chocolate
Yield: 6 servings
4 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1/3 c  Heavy cream
1 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Strong brewed coffee
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  PLUS
3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
1    Egg
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
Grease bottom and sides of an 8 inch square baking pan.

In a medium bowl, combine coffee, granulated sugar and 1/4 cup cocoa,
whisk until well blended.

In a large bowl, combine egg, brown sugar, melted butter, cream and
vanilla.  Blend well.  Add flour, remaining three tablespoons cocoa,
and baking powder.  Pour into prepared pan.  Top with coffee mixture.

Place a round wire or bamboo rack in a wok.   Put filled baking pan on
rack.  Pour boiling water into wok to reach halfway up sides of
baking pan. Cover pan and cook over LOW heat until toothpick inserted
in top half of cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove baking dish from rack.  Serve warm, spooning fudge sauce over
cake.

This cake is a real surprise.  While cooking two layers form; the top
is cakelike and toe bottom becomes a gooey fudge sauce.   Make sure
to spoon some of the sauce over each portion of cake when serving.
