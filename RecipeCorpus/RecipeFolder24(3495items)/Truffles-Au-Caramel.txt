250 g cream 30 g glucose 200 g sugar 150 g milk chocolate 250 g dark
chocolate chocolate for dipping the truffles

Bring cream and glucose to the boil.  Remove pan from heat.  Melt
sugar, slowly, in a copper sugar pan, adding a little sugar at a
time, then cook to required colour of caramel.  Gradually add hot
cream mixture.

Chop the two chocolates in a food processor, add caramel-cream
mixture and process until the mixture is smooth.  Turn out on a clean
surface, cover with plastic wrap and allow to stand for 24 hours, or
until the mixture is firm enough to work with.  Form into small balls
and dip in tempered chocolate and roll in cocoa. Sandy Michell.
