Rice can be classified in three general groups: Short Grain (such as
Italian Risotto, Japanese ushi Rice), Glutionous (Starchy and Sticky)
and Long Grain (less starchy with nutty fragrance like Basmati or
Jasmine). Here's an easy way to cook Jasmine Rice: 1. Rinse 3 cups of
long grain rice in a medium saucepan under COLD

running water to get rid of any extra starch. 2. Swish around with
your fingers. Strain and repeat a few times until water clears. 3.
Add water to cover rice PLUS depth of your index finger's first
joint. 4. Bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to the lowest setting.
(If using electric stove top, move pan to another pre-heated burner
at low). 5. Cover pot with a tight lid and continue cooking for 20
more minutes. 6. Remove pot from heat source and cover lid with with
a folded towel to keep it warm. Let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes, and
serve. 7. Fluff hot rice with wooden paddle and serve steaming hot.
Rive kernels should be separated and fluffy. Damage Control
============== WET RICE: If rice is a bit wet insert a cloth towel
under the lid to let it soak up extra moisture. UNDERCOOKED RICE: If
rice seems a litle undercooked add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water &
continue as in STEP 6 for 5 minutes. From Toronto Star Cooking Section
