Lightly cover the completed loaves with lightly oiled plastic wrap
(so they won't stick to the plastic as they rise). Place the loaves
in a draft free spot to rise. It is best not to use the oven you will
be baking in this time, as you would need to remember to remove the
loaves when you preheat the oven halfway through their proofing.

To Form Rolls: ************** Line baking sheets with baking paper or
lightly spray them with lecithin spary.

Form your rolls with as little handling as possible. Otherwise you
will again activate the gluten, which makes further shaping very
difficult. If you have made unusually shaped rolls an want to redo
them, let the dough rest for 10 minutes, lightly covered with plastic
wrap before you try again.

Rolls come in all shapes and sizes from simple to complex. At the
bakery we do a simple shape, our current favourite being a 7-inch
rope tied in a knot with the ends concealed in the middle.

It is important when rolling out a rope of dough for shaping to use no
flour on the work surface. If there is more than just the flour on
your hands, the dough just flops around and refuses to stretch out
for more than a couple of inches.

The advantage of simple shapes with rolls (especially with whole wheat
bread) is that simple shapes, without intricate turns and twists
minimize the amount of crust and maximize the amount of soft interior.

Place formed rolls on a prepared baking sheet. Cover them lightly
with a piece of lightly oiled plastic and let them rise in a draft
free spot until almost doubled in size.
