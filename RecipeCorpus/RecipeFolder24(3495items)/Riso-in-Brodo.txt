Title: Riso in Brodo
Categories: Italian, Soup/stew, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
4 T  Grated Parmesan cheese
12 c  Broth
2 c  Rice
Bring the broth to a boil, put in the rice, and when the pot boils
again, stir the rice, and reduce the heat a bit.  Cook until the rice
is done, stirring from time to time to prevent sticking.  Serve with
a sprinkling of the cheese on each bowl.  From The Romagnolis' Table
