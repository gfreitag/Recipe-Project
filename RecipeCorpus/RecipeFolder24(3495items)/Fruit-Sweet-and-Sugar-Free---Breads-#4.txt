Bread (cont'd): *************** Now begins the wonderful process of
kneading the dough. Until the dough has begun to develop its gluten
and come together in a ball, it is helpful to use a dough scraper or
baker's knife to help with the kneading. Use the scraper to get under
the dough and fold it over itself. Use the palm and heal of your
other hand to press into the dough and away from you for the count of
two; then lift your hand away. With the dough scraper, get under the
dough and give the entire mass a quarter turn and fold the dough in
half. Once again use the heel of your other hand to press into the
dough and away from you, again for the count of two. Continue this
process of scraping the dough from underneath, giving it a quarter
turn, folding it in half, and pressing in and away, until the dough
begins to develop itself into a smoother, more companct whole. You
will probably need to sprinkle a little flour under the dough each
time you scrape it from underneath to prevent it from sticking to the
table.

At this point you can stop using the dough scraper and use both of
your hands to knead the dough. You will soon develop a very
rhythmical motion to your kneading. Remember to lift the dough from
the table with each quarter turn and to use a firm touch but no so
hard as to break or tear the dough.

This process can take from 10 to 20 minutes or more, depending on the
quantity of dough and your skill as a kneader. The final dough should
be smooth and elastic. It will be firm but soft and no longer sticky
to the touch. You will be able to pick the dough up and pull it
gently apart without its tearing. Dough at this stage is truly
beautiful to work with. It feels so alive in your hands and so vital
that you may not want to stop working with it.
