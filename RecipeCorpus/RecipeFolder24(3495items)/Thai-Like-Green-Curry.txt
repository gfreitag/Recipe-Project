1) Soak garbanzo beans and cook according to package directions (I
used a crock pot). 2) Take next set of ingredients and blend in food
processor or blender until they form a paste. 3) Heat a non-stick
skillet over medium heat for a few minutes then add paste. Stir and
cook for about five minutes. Some of paste may stick and brown but
don't let it burn. Add apple juice and stir to unstick bottom crust.
Cook for another 5 minutes stirring. 4) Add cooked garbanzo beans and
bring to a low boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 15 minutes. 5) Add
evaporated milk and simmer another 15 minutes. 6) Serve over rice.
