Title: Orange Chantilly
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 1 cup
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
1 c  Fresh orange juice
In the old days, we would have whipped up mounds of cream to top our
fruits. Instead, I've drained non-fat yogurt and combined it with
just a bit of whipped heavy cream for that great fluff. One
tablespoon is more than enough to top each portion of a dessert.

1. Line a strainer with a double layer of cheesecloth. Place yogurt
in the center and let drain for 1 hour.

2. Place orange juice in a small pan, bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer for about 20 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally until a
very thick syrup remains. There should be about 2 tablespoons.
Reserve.

3. Whip the cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until it holds
stiff peaks.

4. Place the drained yogurt in a bowl and stir in the orange syrup.
Gently fold in the whipped cream with a rubber spatula.

5. Serve with dessert of your choice.

NOTE: The heavy cream in this recipe may be omitted. Increase the
amount of yogurt to 1 1/2 cups. Once the yogurt has drained, add the
orange syrup and whisk until it is smooth.
