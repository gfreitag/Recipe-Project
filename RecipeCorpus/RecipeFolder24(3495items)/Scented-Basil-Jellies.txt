This recipe for delicate, easy-to-make jellies comes from the
Shepherd's Garden Seeds catalog.  The clear jewellike colors of these
jellies - rose-pink, deep-garnet, and champagne - are quite
beautiful. And the jellies themselves are delicious with cream cheese
and crackers or bagels. They make wonderful presents for others - or
yourself!
