******To toast almonds and to toast and skin hazelnuts: Preheat oven
to 350 F.  Spread measured nuts separately on jelly-roll or pizza
pans and bake them, stirring and turning them every 2 or 3 minutes,
until they smell toasty and a nut, broken open, is pale gold, about
10 minutes; be careful not to let the nuts over-brown.  Cool the
nuts, then rub the hazelnuts in a towel until as much as possible of
the brown skin has flaked off; it isn't important to remove every bit.

Butter two 8-cup, 9" loaf pans (or a 12", 16-cup "pullman" loaf pan)
and line them with baking parchment or brown paper, cutting paper to
extend 1/2 to 1" above the pan rim.  Butter the lining paper.

Combine in a very large mixing bowl all the candied and dried fruits
and the grated lemon zest.  Add orange juice and the 1/2 c.
orange-flavored liqueur; mix everything thoroughly, breaking up any
clumps of fruit. Let the mixture stand for at least an hour or for up
to 3 hours, mixing it occasionally so the liquid is evenly absorbed.

Add walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts; mix them well with the fruit.

Preheat oven to 300 F.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and mace.  Sift the
mixture over the fruits and nuts and mix them thoroughly (this is
done fastest and best with a pair of clean hands.)

Beat eggs until they are well combined, then beat in the vanilla and
almond extracts.  Continuing to beat, add sugar gradually and beat
until the mixture is pale and thick.  Pour the egg batter over the
floured fruit and nuts; mix them together gently but thoroughly
(again, using your hands is recommended).  Be sure the fruit and nuts
are not clumped together; each piece should be lightly coated with
batter.
