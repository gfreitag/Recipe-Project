just beginning to smoke, add scallops,stirring so they separate.
After 1-2 min., drain them through colander, reserving 2-3 tbs. oil.

flipping the wok 2-3 min. Drain again, reserving 1 tbs. oil. Again,
return reserved oil to wok. Stir-fry garlic & ginger several seconds
& add chicken broth,dry sherry, salt,pepper & cornstarch mixture.
When it thickens, return scallops & vegetables to wok & allow them to
become hot. Serve. Note: Make sure all sand is removed from scallops
