Title: Warm Oriental Chicken and Orange Salad
Categories: Asian, Main dish, Chicken, Poultry, Salad
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Ginseng
1 lb Boneless chicken breasts
2 c  Torn salad greens
2    Oranges; peeled & sectioned
1/4 c  Unsalted peanuts
2    Radishes; sliced
2    Scallions; sliced diagonally
2    Scallions, cut in fourths
3    Garlic cloves
1/4 c  Vinegar
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Orange juice
1 tb Sesame oil
1 tb Hot mustard
2 ts Hot pepper sauce
In a food processor or blender, place the quartered scallions, garlic,
vinegar, soy sauce, orange juice, sesame oil, mustard, pepper sauce
and ginseng.  Process until smooth.  Place the chicken pieces in a
shallow baking dish, and pour the marinade over it.  Cover with
plastic wrap and chill for 4 hours or overnight.

Remove chicken from the marinade.  Grill or broil it until done and
transfer it to a plate.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the marinade to a boil;
boil for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.

Slice the chicken into thin strips and arrange it on the salad
greens. Top with the orange segments, peanuts, sliced radishes and
scallions. Pour the heated marinade over the salad and serve
immediately.

Murphy writes: "A tangy marinade gives this salad a lot of flavor
without a lot of fat."
