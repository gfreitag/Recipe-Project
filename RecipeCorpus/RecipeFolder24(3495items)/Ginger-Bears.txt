Title: Ginger Bears
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 12 bears
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Ground ginger
1 tb Golden syrup
2 oz Butter
1 oz Caster sugar
2 oz White flour
2 oz Wholewheat flour
MMMMM------------------------TO DECORATE-----------------------------
Sweets, chocolate, etc.
Set the oven to 180 C (350 F, Gas Mark 4) and line two large baking
sheets with nonstick paper.

Put the butter or margarine into a bowl with the caster sugar and beat
together until they are light and creamy.  Add the flours, baking
powder, ginger and syrup, and beat again to make a dough.  On a
lightly floured board, roll out the dough to 2.5 mm (1/8 inch), then
cut into teddy bears. Put the biscuits on the baking sheets -- they
won't spread much.

Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the biscuits look golden brown,
set and are browning a little more at the edges.  Leave to cool on
the sheets, then decorate, using glace icing, little sweets, hundreds
of thousands, some melted chocolate.
