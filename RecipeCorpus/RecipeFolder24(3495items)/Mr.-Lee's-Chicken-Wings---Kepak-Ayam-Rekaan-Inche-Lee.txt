Categories: Appetizer, Chicken, Asian, Poultry
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Chinese Rice Wine or Sherry
1 tb Chinese Thick Sauce
2 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
1 ts Black Pepper
16    Chicken Wings (about 1 lb.)
2 ts Minced Gingerroot
2 ts Water
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Honey
4 ts Lime Juice
Directions: A unique blend of seasonings make these stand out from
other chicken wings. Chinese thick sauce is added to the marinade to
deepen the color; it may be omitted if hard to find. Arrange on
lettuce leaves, if serving cold. Combine gingerroot and water in a
small cup. Squeeze gingerroot until water is cloudy. Strain
gingerroot juice into a small bowl, discarding gingerroot. Add
remaining ingredients excepting chicken wings; mix well. Cut off
chicken wing tips, if desired; Place wings in a shallow baking dish.
Add marinade; mix well. Cover and marinade in refrigerator at least 2
hours or overnight, turning wings occasionally. Preheat oven to 350F
(175C). Line a 15 x 10 inch baking pan with foil. Spray foil with a
non-stick coating. Drain wings, reserving 1/4 cup marinade. Place on
prepared pan. Drizzle with reserved marinade. Bake 45 minutes.  Place
on a heated platter; serve at once, or bake in advance and serve cold.
