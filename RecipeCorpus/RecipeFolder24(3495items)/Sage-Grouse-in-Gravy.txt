Title: Sage Grouse in Gravy
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Game
Yield: 4 servings
1 cn Soup, Cream of Mushroom
1 cn Chicken broth
1 pk Soup, Lipton onion mix
1    Sage Grouse, cut in pieces
1/2 c  Oil, olive
1/2 c  Wine, blush or white
Dredge sage grouse in flour. Brown in a large heavy skillet. Remove
grouse and deglaze pan with wine. Add soup, soup mix and about half
of the broth; stir. Put the grouse back in the pan, cover and simmer
for 1 hour or until the meat is tender. Add more broth if necessary.
Serve over rice or noodles.

This is a classic camp dinner for sage grouse hunting trips. It works
perfectly in a Dutch oven. I prefer to bone and pound the breasts to
increase tenderness and reduce cooking time. This recipe can be
modified by adding vegetable (mushrooms, carrots, potatoes) either
canned or raw. If canned drain, then add in for the last 20 minutes
of cooking time. If raw, add for at least 40 minutes cooking time.
This recipe can be used for other birds but works best with sage
grouse.
