Title: Baked Guavas Stuffed with Mushrooms and Olives (Yemenite)
Categories: Fruit, Vegetable, Middle east
Yield: 6 servings
4 ts Fresh dill weed; chopped
-or-
1 ts Dried dill
1/2 ts Each salt and pepper
1 tb Sesame seeds
6    Guavas
1 tb Oil
1 c  Mushrooms; chopped
1 tb Onion; chopped
1/2 c  Green olives; chopped
2 tb Parsley; chopped
Preheat oven to 325 F.

To prepare the guavas for stuffing, cut a thin slice from the top of
the guava.  With a melon ball scoop or small spoon, remove the seeds
and set the guavas aside.

Heat the oil in a skillet.  Add mushrooms, onion, green olives,
herbs, salt and pepper; saute until vegetables are soft.  Remove the
mixture from the flame; cool.  Stuff the guavas, filling them to the
top.

Place stuffed guavas in a baking dish just large enough to hold them
and sprinkle sesame seeds over the guava tops.  Bake for 1 hour, or
until the fruit is tender.  Serve hot.
