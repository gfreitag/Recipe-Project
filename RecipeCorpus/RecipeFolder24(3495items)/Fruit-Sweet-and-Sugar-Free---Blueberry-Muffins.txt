Categories: Bread, Fruit, Muffin
Yield: 36 minimuffin
MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT AND NUTS----------------------------
2 c  Frozen blueberries
1 c  Walnuts
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 t  Vanilla extract
7 T  Buttermilk
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
2 T  Butter
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
3/4 c  Fruit sweetener
1/4 c  Apple butter
2    Eggs
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/2 t  Salt
1 t  Cinnamon
2 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
1 1/8 t  Baking soda
1 1/8 t  Baking powder
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lighly spray regular sized or mini
muffin tins with lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts in the oven for
7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the walnuts to cool, then
coarsely chop them with a knife or with a pulsing action in a food
processor. Set aside. Whisk the sour cream, fruit sweetener, apple
butter, eggs, vanilla, and buttermilk together in the order listed
until well blended. Stir in the rolled oats. Let this mixture sit for
a minimum of 5 minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
Sift together the dry ingredients into a large bowl; make a well in
the center. Melt the butter and stir it into the dry mix. When half
mixed, stir in the frozen blueberries and toasted walnuts, folding
and stirring just until mixed. The batter will be lumpy. Use a well
rounded #12 scoop (2/3 cup) to place the muffin batter in the regular
sized pans, and use a #24 scoop (2-3 tablespoons) for the mini
muffins. Place either size muffins on the middle shelf of the
preheated oven. Bake regular muffins for 30-35 minutes and mini
muffins for 15-20 minutes. Turn the muffin pans once to brown evenly.
Let the muffins cool for five minutes before removing them to a wire
rack to cool completely. However, don't be shy about eating blueberry
muffins right from the oven. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   10-01-94
