MMMMM-------------------FIRST, PREPARE THE PAN------------------------
Melt 1/3 cup butter in heavy 10" skillet or baking dish.  Sprinkle
1/2 cup brown sugar evenly over butter.  Arrange drained, cooked
fruit in attractive pattern on the butter-sugar coating. Make the
cake batter and pour it over fruit.  Bake until wooden pick thrust
into center of cake comes out clean.  Immediately turn upside-down on
serving plate. Do not remove pan for a few minutes.  Brown sugar
mixture will run down over cake instead of clinging to pan. Serve
warm with plain or whipped cream. Note: I recommend pineapple slices,
with maraschino cherries studded in between for fruit. -Perry- Cake
