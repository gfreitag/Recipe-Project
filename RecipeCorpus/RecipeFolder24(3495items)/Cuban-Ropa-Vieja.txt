Categories: Main dish, Beef, Meat, Caribbean
Yield: 8 servings
1    Green bell pepper; cored,

1 c  Tomato sauce
1 ts Salt
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  Dry wine
3 1/2 lb Beef Chuck or Pot Roast

Rub salt and pepper into the meat.  Heat a large covered frying pan or
stove-top casserole and add a bit of the oil.  Brown the meat well on
both sides, and then add about 1 cup of water.  Cover and simmer
until very tender, about 2 hours. If the pan dries out during
cooking, add more water. Allow the meat to cool, covered, in the pan
juices. Remove the meat from the pan; debone and shred the meat. Set
aside in a bown, along with the pan juices.

Reheat the pan and add the remaining oil.  Saute the onion and
garlic, just until clear.  Add the green pepper and saute for a few
minutes more. Add the remaining ingredients, including the shredded
meat and juices. Cover and simmer on low heat for 15 to 20 minutes
more.

Serve with rice or salad.
