Title: Clarified Butter
Categories: Condiment
Yield: 1 batch
-- unsalted
1 lb Good butter (4 sticks)
-- (sweet cream butter)
Place butter in a heavy saucepan and set the pan over low heat.  Heat
the butter, taking a look at it from time to time to make sure that
it is not overheating, for 15 minutes; it will bubble and look foamy,
evidence that its moisture is being cooked away.  Continue to simmer
the butter for 20 to 25 minutes in all, without disturbing it.  It
has been sufficiently clarified when the boiling action (caused by
the evaporation of moisture) lessens and the foamy top crust begins
to look dry. Do not let the butter get hot enough to even _think_
about getting brown during the clarification.

Remove butter from the heat and let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes to
settle. Carefully skim off the top crust, reserving it, if you like,
to season vegetables (it has abundant flavor).  Carefully pour off
the clear golden liquid into a completely dry jar or crock; stop
pouring before the sediment in the bottom of the pot is disturbed.
(These good dregs, like the foam, can season vegetables, if you are
of the waste-not persuasion.)

Cool clarified butter until it begins to congeal, cover it airtight,
and refrigerate it.  Keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator.

Yield: About 1 1/2 cups.

Witty writes: "Butter that has been clarified is excellent for
sauteing foods (unlike whole butter, it won't scorch readily), and it
is also indispensable for sealing pots of meat or fish paste.  If you
clarify a pound or so of butter at a time, you will have a supply
always at hand in the refrigerator."
