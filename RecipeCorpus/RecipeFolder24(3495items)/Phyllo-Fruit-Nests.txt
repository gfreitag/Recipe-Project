Title: Phyllo Fruit Nests
Categories: Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
-fresh fruit
-phyllo sheets
-juice
A nice, easy, use for oil-less phyllo is as fancy nests in which to
serve poached fruit. I cut (or tear) a sheet in 2 or 3 strips, drape
them in an oven-proof bowl, and bake (at about 400 F, check the box)
until they are lightly toasted with a few darker places. Poach some
fruit (whole pears and apples are nice) in juice && serve in the
phyllo nest w/ a bit of the poaching syrup dribbled over the top
(maybe add a few whole berries to decorate). Assemble them at serving
time so the phyllo will not get soggy.
