To make terrine: wash trotters and clean well.  Place in a large pot
with other meats, vegetables, herbs and seasonings.  Cover with a
light stock and bring to the boil.  Cover pot and simmer until meat
falls off the bones.  Skim from time to time to clear stock.  When
meat is cooked, remove meat and vegetables and set aside.

Strain stock and discard solids.  Remove as much fat as possible.
Return stock to clean pot and reduce to a strong stock that will
jelly. Pick meat from bones and pack, with vegetables, into 2 x 30 cm
x 6 cm terrines. Pour in stock to fill terrines.  Cover and
refrigerate overnight.

To make sauce: mix together required amounts of sauce ingredients, to
your taste.

To serve: turn out terrines and cut in slices.  Serve sauce in a
