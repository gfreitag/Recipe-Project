Title: Basic Salad Dressing Ii
Categories: Diabetic, Dressing, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 8 servings
1/8 ts Garlic powder;
1/8 ts Sugar;
1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice;
2 tb Red wine vinegar;
2 tb Acceptable vegetable oil;
4 tb Water;
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper;
In  jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine all ingredients.  Shake
well and refrigerate.  Makes 1/2 cup.  (Half of published recipe.) My
note: I frequently use bottled lemon juice which has sodium listed,
but there can't be much sodium in 1/2 tsp. divided among 8 servings.
If you use fresh lemon juice, extra can be frozen in an ice cube tray
or small container.
