3/8 c  Raisins
1/3 c  Walnuts
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/4 t  Apple cider vinegar
2 c  +2T oat bran
4    Egg whites
3/4 c  Fruit sweetener

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly spray the muffin tins with
lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts in the oven for 7-10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool, then coarsely chop
them with a knife or with a pulsing action in a food processor. Bring
3/4 cup water to a boil in a small pot, add the raisins. When the
water returns to a boil, turn off the heat. Let the raisins plump in
the water for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins, saving the
raisin water for another use. The raising water can be used to
replace part or all of the 3/4 cup water. In a medium sized bowl,
combine the fruit sweetener, water, oil and vinegar. Then stir in the
oat bran. Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl and
make a well in the center. In a small bowl, whip the egg whites until
frothy. Then stir them into the oat bran mixture. Stir the oat bran
mixture into the dry ingredients. When half mixed, stir in the
raisins and walnuts. Spoon the batter into the prepared pans, just to
the top of each muffin cup. Bake the muffins on the middle shelf of
the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes. Turn the muffin tins once, if
necessary to allow the muffins to brown evenly. Let the muffins cool
in the pan for 5 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool
completely. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   10-01-94
