Categories: Caribbean, Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 1 batch
1    Jalapeno or serrano chile
-- stem & seeds removed

1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Heavy cream
6 c  :Hot water
Salt and pepper
2 tb Butter or margarine
2    To 3 tb vegetable oil

Lettuce
Sliced tomato
Salsa de Aji* (see recipe)
1    Avocado; sliced
In a large pot, melt butter and add the oil.  Stir in the paprika and
saute onions until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add potatoes; saute
over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until
potatoes are somewhat golden.

Place chiles and 1/2 c of the milk in a blender or food processor.
Puree until smooth and add to the potatoes along with the cream and
remaining milk.

Raise the heat and, when the sauce begins to boil, add the hot water
and season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30
minutes, or until the thin slices of potato are broken down and the
the thick slices are tender. Thicken the soup.  Serve the potatoes
along with the Salsa de aji, lettuce, avocados, and sliced tomatoes.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

Heat Scale: Mild.

Note: To assist in thickening the soup, you can puree some of the
cooked potatoes with a little broth and add it back to the pot.

This is a recipe from "Chile Pepper" magazine.  Locro usually refers
to a thick, potato-based stew which can be served with a number of
meats or vegetables.
