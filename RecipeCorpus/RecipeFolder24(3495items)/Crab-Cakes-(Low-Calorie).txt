Place the white bread in a food processor and process to soft crumbs.
Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites, mayonnaise,
lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, sherry, hot sauce, paprika, curry
powder, black pepper, mustard, allspice, cayenne and parsley.  Add
the crabmeat and bread crumbs; toss with a fork to combine, taking
care not to break up the crab meat lumps.  Shape the crab mixture
into twelve 2 1/2- to 3- inch patties and place them on a baking
sheet lined with waxed paper. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes to
dry the patties slightly. (The patties can be made 1 day ahead;
covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated.) In a 10-inch non-stick
skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over moderate heat. Add 6
of the crab patties and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes on
each side.  Set the cooked patties aside in a warm oven while you fry
the other 6 patties in the remaining teaspoon of olive oil. Serve at
once. Makes 4 servings; 264 Calories per serving. [THE BALTIMORE SUN;
