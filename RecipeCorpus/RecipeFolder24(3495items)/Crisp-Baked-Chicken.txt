Preheat the oven at 375 degrees. Place the chicken pieces in a greased
baking dish.  Place the oil, lemon juice, mustard, plenty of
seasoning, sage and onion in a screw-top jar and shake well until
everything is thoroughly combined. Brush the chicken pieces

chicken portion as it is brushed with the mixture to make, even

crisp and golden outside and thoroughly cooked through and the juices
run clear when pierced with the tip of a knife.  Serve at once.
