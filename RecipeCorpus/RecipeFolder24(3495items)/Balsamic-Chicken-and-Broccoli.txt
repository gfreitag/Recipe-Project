Keywords: Chicken, Healthy, Main dish Servings: 1

Notes:  Mince garlic.  Thinly slice onion, then cut into thirds. Cut
chicken into strips. Mushrooms should be oyster or shittake, sliced
or left whole, depending on the type. Heat the oil in a heavy pot.
Add the garlic, onion, and shallots, and cook until light golden.
Keep the pot covered between stirrings and use a tablespoon or so of
the wine if more liquid is needed. Add the strips of chicken and
enough of the wine to keep the meat from sticking to the pot. Cook
until the chicken is white all the way through, about 5 to 7 minutes
(use more wine, if needed). Remove the chicken and sauteed vegetables
with a slotted spoon. Add the vinegar to the pot, increase the heat,
and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping bits from the bottom, until
the liquid is reduced to about half its volume. Reduce the heat.
Return the chicken and sauteed vegetables to the pot, add the
broccoli, mushrooms, stock, remaining wine, and salt. Cook at a
gentle simmer until the broccoli turn bright green. Serve over pasta
or brown rice, and dust with pepper. Protein: 30 grams Carb: 8 grams
