Title: Jalapeno Apricot Jelly
Categories: Can/preserv, Condiment, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
1 1/2 c  Chopped dried apricots
6 c  Sugar
1 pk Liquid pectin (3 oz.)
3    To 4 dr red food coloring*
-- (I omitted)
1/2 c  Jalapenos
-- stems and seeds removed
1 lg Red bell pepper
-- stems and seeds removed
2 c  Cider vinegar
*My note: Although the recipe calls for food coloring, the apricots,
jalapenos and red pepper combine to make a beautiful orange color on
their own, and I didn't add any food coloring.  I think it would
spoil the effect.

Put jalapenos, bell pepper and vinegar in blender. Puree until
coarsely ground and small chunks remain.

Combine apricots, sugar and chili mixture in large saucepan.  Bring
to a boil.  Boil rapidly for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and skim
off any foam that forms.

Allow mixture to cool for 2 minutes.  Then mix in pectin and food
coloring, if using.

Pour into sterilized jars, seal and cool.  (I processed in a boiling
water bath for 10 minutes.)

Yield: 3 pints.  (I got 7 half pints.)

Gerlach writes: "This recipe calls for apricots, but peaches,
nectarines and pears work equally well.  Any fresh green chile can
also be substituted depending on your heat preference.  Serranos will
make it hotter; roasted, peeled New Mexican chiles will tame it down."

Magazine of Spicy Foods," May/June 1990.  Vol. IV, No. 3.  Pp. 30-31.
