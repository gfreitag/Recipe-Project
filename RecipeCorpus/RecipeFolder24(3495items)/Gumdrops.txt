Title: Gumdrops
Categories: Dessert, Candy
Yield: 1 batch
Food coloring
Flavoring extract, to taste
1 lb Gum arabic
3 c  Water
2 c  Sugar
Soak the gum arabic in the water overnight; then carefully dissolve
it over hot water, strain, and add the sugar.

Heat until the sugar is dissolved, then add coloring and flavoring and
remove from heat. When as thick as honey, pour the mixture into starch
molds.* Set in a warm place for several days, or until the drops are
hard enough to handle. Then dampen slightly and shape by rolling in
sugar.

* A STARCH TRAY is used when molding fondants, liqueurs, fruit
jellies, or other candies in starch. Any large flat box or biscuit
pan will do for this. 3"x20" is a convenient size. Fill the box with
clean, dry, sifted cornstarch. Smooth the starch with a flat stick;
then make the required impressions on it with small plaster molds
glued to a piece of wood. They may be made with a cork, a piece of
sealing-wax, a thimble, a marble, a glass stopper, or the tip of the
finger. The piece of wood should be longer than the box or pan (this
way, your molds will be flat on top and all evenly shaped). Pour or
pipe in the candy mixture, filling each mold level with the top of
the starch. When set, pick up the candies and dust off the starch.
Keep the starch dry and clean in tin boxes. It should always be dried
and sieved before use.
