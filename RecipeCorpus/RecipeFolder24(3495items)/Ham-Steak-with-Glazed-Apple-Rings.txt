Title: Ham Steak with Glazed Apple Rings
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 main dish
1 md Size tart apple, sliced,
Cored and cut into six
Sliced
1/2 c  Apple juice
2 tb Lemon juice
3 tb Butter
1 1/2 lb Fully cooked ham steak
At least 1/2 inch thick
2 ts Dark brown sugar
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
Prepare apple slices, and put in bowl with lemon juice to prevent
apples from discoloring.

Heat 12 inch heavy fry pan over moderately high heat, add 1 tb
butter, melt until bubbly.  Add the ham steak and cook uncovered for
3 minutes on each side or until browned.  Remove the ham to a platter
and set aside.

Pour off and discard of all drippings. Wipe pan clean. Lower heat to
medium and place pan back on burner and then add the remaining two
tablespoons of butter and the sugar and cinnamon.  Heat until the
butter is bubbly, then add the apple rings and cook uncovered for 2
minutes per side or until they just begin to soften.  Watch carefully
so they do not burn. When soft, remove and place on top of ham slice.

Add the apple juice to the skillet and boil for one minute, scraping
up any brown bits stuck to the pan.  Slide ham and apple rings back
into the skillet to reheat briefly.  Spoon the  apple juice over the
ham and apples, and place on platter.
