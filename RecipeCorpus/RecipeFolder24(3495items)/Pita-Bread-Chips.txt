Title: Pita Bread Chips
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings  1 x Pita bread

Microwave Pita bread just to soften (approx 22 seconds/2 pita bread)

Cut with a knife into the edges of the Pita Bread and slowly separate
the 'top' from the 'bottom' (you will have two circles)

Cut each circle into 4 pie shaped wedges.

Place the wedges smooth side down (outside of pita bread) on a cookie
sheet. The rough (somewhat moist) inside of the Pita bread is up -
thus anything you sprinkle on the wedges will stick.

I like to sprinkle the wedges with Hungarian Hot Paprika

Bake 375 degrees for 8 minutes.
