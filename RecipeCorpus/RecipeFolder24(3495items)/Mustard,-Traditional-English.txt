Title: Mustard, Traditional English
Categories: Salsa/sauce, British, Condiment, Herbs/spice, Spread
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  Mustard powder dry
1 c  Water
Mustard loses potency if heated therefore the traditional recipe
calls for COLD water.

Mix mustard powder and cold water in proportions to make a smooth
paste but only enough for current use. Let stand for at least 10
minutes before serving to allow the enzymes to develop.

Serve: with beef, ham, cheese and sausages.
