Title: Stuffed Zucchini Boats
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
- to taste
1 c  Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
2 tb Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
1/3 c  Parsley, finely chopped
4 tb Parmesan, fresh grated
1    Egg yolk
3 tb Olive oil (extra virgin is
- best)
4    Zucchini, 1/2 lb. each
1/2 lb Mushrooms
4 tb Butter
1 c  Onion, finely chopped
2 ts Garlic, finely minced
2 ts Lemon juice
1/4 ts Thyme (the dried type)
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Preheat oven to 450F.  Trim off the ends of each zucchini.  Cut
each in half crosswise.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise.  Scoop
out the centers, leaving a shell at least 1/4-inch thick.  Reserve
and finely chop the scooped-out portions.  There should be about
1-1/2 cups. Pour enough water to cover the shells into a saucepan and
boil.
Add the shells and simmer 2 minutes.  Drain thoroughly.  Clean and
finely chop mushrooms.  There should be about 2 cups.  Heat butter in
heavy skillet and add onions and garlic.  Cook briefly, stirring, and
add mushrooms and lemon juice.  Stir and cook one minute.  Add the
chopped zucchini, thyme, salt and pepper.  Cook about 3 minutes until
the excess moisture evaporates.
Spoon and scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl and let cool
slightly. Add 1 cup of the bread crumbs, the parsley, 2 tablespoons
of the cheese and blend thoroughly.  Stir in the egg yolk.
With 1 tablespoon of the oil, brush the inside of a baking dish
big enough to hold the shells in one layer.  Spoon an equal portion
of the filling into each shell and smooth over the top.  Blend the
remaining 2 tablespoons bread crumbs with the remaining 2 tablespoons
cheese and sprinkle over the top of the stuffed zucchini boats.
Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
Place the dish in the oven and bake 25 minutes.  Serve
immediately. NOTE FROM ME:  I cut the finished zucchini in half to
serve more people before "saucing". Recipe from Pierre Franey's
column, "The 60 Minute Gourmet".
