MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
Fresh thyme and savory
Remove the tops from the tomatoes and core.  In a small bowl, mix the
thyme, savory, bread crumbs, and 1 tb. oil.  Divide the herb mixture
among the tomatoes, then set them in a small baking pan.

Preheat the oven to 425 F.

Wash and dry the quail.  Rub the birds inside and out with salt and
pepper, then place 3 savory sprigs in the cavity of each.  Set on a
rack in a roasting pan and roast for approximately 25 minutes.  The
birds should be golden brown all over.  If they are cooked but not
brown, run them under the broiler.

After the quail have cooked for 10 minutes, put the tomatoes in the
oven. Coat the pepper strips and mushrooms with the remaining oil and
place them in the oven 5 minutes later.  The vegetables should be
cooked tender, but not soft, when the quail is ready.  Season with
salt and pepper and place 2 quail on each serving plate.  Garnish
with thyme and savory.
