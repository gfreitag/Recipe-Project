1/8 ts Garlic salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Pepper, red, roasted,

On a hard surface with a meat mallet or similar flattening
utensil, pound the chicken to a 1/4-inch thickness.

Spread pesto on each side of the chicken breasts.

Spray a large non-stick frypan with vegetable cooking spray
(PAM, as an example) and heat quickly on high until pan is very hot.

Reduce the heat to medium and add the chicken, searing 3 - 4
minutes or until lightly brown on both sides.

Remove the chicken, set aside.

To the drippings in the pan, add the broth, vinegar, mushrooms,
and onion.  Cook for 1 minute, stirring to loosen the brown bits from
the bottom of the pan.

Add the browned chicken, turning to coat.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes or
until chicken is fork tender.

Season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with red pepper, olives,
and cilantro.
