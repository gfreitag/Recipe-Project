Title: Earl's Crab Cake
Categories: Sandwich, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 ts Old Bay seasoning
ds Dry mustard
1    Egg, beaten
1 lb Backfin crab meat
2 tb Mayonnaise
2 ds Worcestershire sauce
Make sure there are no shells in crab meat. There shouldn't be very
many in backfin. Handle carefully so that the meat remains in lumps.
Put all ingredients in a bowl and carefully mix so that the crab meat
remains in lumps. I do this by repeatedly lifting the lumps with my
fingers and turning them over in the bowl. Form into four crab cakes
and place on a platter or dish. Place in refrigerator for at least an
hour, longer if time permits. This allows egg to gel enough to hold
crab cake together when frying. Deep fry in hot vegetable oil (375
degrees) for about 90 seconds or until crab cakes are light brown.
Drain on paper towel. Serve on bread or saltine crackers.

NOTE: NEVER put bread or cracker crumbs inside a crab cake sandwich.
