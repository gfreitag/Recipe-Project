To Prepare dough by Machine: **************************** Combine the
cold raisin water with the hot water so that the mixture is lukewarm.
Pour it into the bowl of your electric mixer. Add the molasses, oil,
yeast, salt and eggs. On the lowest speed, use the dough hook to stir
in 5 cups of flour to form a medium soft dough. Once the flour is
incorporated, increase the mixer speed to medium and knead the dough
for 5 to 10 minutes, adding only enough additional flour to form a
medium stiff dough that comes off both the sides and bottom of the
bowl.

To prepare the dough by hand: ***************************** Combine
1/4 cup of the hot water with 1 tablespoon of the molasses in a small
bowl. When the mixture is lukewarm, stir in the yeast. Set the bowl
aside until the yeast is bubbly, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile mix
together the raisin water, the remaining 10 tablespoons hot water,
the remaining 1 tablespoon mollases, the oil, salt and eggs. Stir in
the activated yeast and 5 cups of the whole wheat flour to form a
medium soft dough. Sprinkle a little bit of flour on your work
surface. Knead the dough, adding additional flour only if necessary
to keep the dough from sticking. Knead the dough for 15-20 minutes,
until it becomes smooth and elastic.

Raising the dough and forming loaves or rolls:
********************************************** Place the well kneaded
dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and
let the dough rise in a warm, draft free spot until doubled in size.
Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl, and using your fist, gently
deflate the dough by punching it down. Knead the dough in the bowl
about 10 times. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap again and let the
dough rise until doubled. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a
very lightly floured surface. Form the dough into two loaves or
twenty-four rolls, or a combination of both. Place the loaves into
standard size bread pans and the rolls onto baking paper lined baking
sheets. Place the rolls 3 inches apart to allow room for them to
spread as they rise. Lightly cover the bread and/or rolls with an
oiled piece of plastic and let them rise until doubled in size.

To bake the loaves or rolls: **************************** Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees. For loaves, use a serrated knife to make
diagonal slashes across the tops of the loaves. Place them on the
middle shelf of the preheated oven, and bake for 40-45 minutes. The
tops will be a deep brown, and the bread will slide easily out of the
baking pan when the loaves are done. Give the bottom of the loaf a
tap. It should sound hollow. Let the loaves cool out of their pans on
a wire rack. For rolls, prepare the egg wash. Lightly brush the tops
of each roll with the egg wash and sprinkle them with either poppy or
sesame seeds or leave them plain. Bake the rolls on the middle shelf
of the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes. The rolls are done when they
are a deep brown on their top and bottom. Remove the rolls from the
baking pan and cool them on a wire rack. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On
