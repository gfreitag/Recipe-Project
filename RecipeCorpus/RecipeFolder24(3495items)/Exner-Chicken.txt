Title: Exner Chicken
Categories: Chicken, Fruit, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
Black pepper, freshly ground
1 pn Cinnamon
1 pn Nutmeg
1 pn Cayenne
1/2 ea Chicken
1 cn Peaches, 28 oz, light syrup
3 T  Honey
SPICES
Salt
* I use Clingstone Peach Slices which are in light syrup. Chop up the
chicken into little pieces. Place in an 8 * 8 baking tray. Drizzle a
layer of honey over those pieces (about 3 tablespoons). Spoon in a
can of peach slices, do not add any of the syrup or the dish will be
too sweet. Season with spices, I like to use some salt, a few grinds
of fresh black pepper, a very light dusting with cinnamon and nutmeg
and a pinch of cayenne pepper for zing. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes,
turn pieces, bake another 25 minutes at 350. Do not do this in a
Jet-Stream Oven! Serve with Snowpeas and Corn. Notes: You can change
the flavour by changing the spicing combination. You can try adding
garlic, butter buds, orange rind to the dish. If you like a more
liquidy dish, try adding 3 tablespoons of Diet 7 Up. Origin: Sheila
