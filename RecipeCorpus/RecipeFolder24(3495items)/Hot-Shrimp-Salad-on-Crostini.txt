Most people hate to clean shrimp, but these days they're sold peeled
and deveined. Or buy a pound of shrimp when you have some extra time,
clean them and freeze in 1/4 pound portions to have on hand. It's
less expensive that way!

1. Place tomato pieces in a bowl.

2. Pinch off delicate stems and leaves from bunch of watercress to
measure 1/2 cup; reserve.

3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat. Add
shrimp; cook 4 minutes, stirring and shaking skillet. When cooked
through, add to tomatoes.

4. Toss capers and lemon juice with tomatoes and shrimp. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.

5. Brush one side of toast (crostini) with remaining  teaspoon oil.
Rub oiled side of toast with garlic, cut-side down, using both halves
of garlic or to taste.

6. Place toast in the center of a large dinner plate. Spoon shrimp and
tomatoes over toast. Top with watercress and serve immediately.
