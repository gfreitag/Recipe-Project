1 ea Bouquet garni
10 ea Bratwurst sausages (or any

4 ea Parsnips
30 ea Pickling onions
3 x  No 18 duck
250 g  Butter
250 g  Chopped bacon
10 lg Brown onions, skins on
1 kg Carrots, chopped
1 bn Celery, chopped finely
beurre manie (butter blended with flour to a smooth paste) salt and
pepper a little vinegar Remove oil glands from tails of ducks. Heat
some of the butter in a large, heavy frying pan and brown ducks, one
at a time, on all sides.  Transfer to a large boiler.  Fry bacon,
onions, carrots and celery until golden, adding more butter as
needed.  Remove with a slotted spoon and add to boiler with bouquet
garni and enough cold water to just cover. Simmer gently, covered,
until ducks are tender (about 1 1/2 hours). Remove ducks from boiler,
take meat from bones, cut in large pieces and set aside. Return bones
and skin to boiler and boil to reduce liquid to about 3 cups. Brown
sausages in frying pan and cut in 2 or 3 cm diagonal slices. Grate
parsnips coarsely.  Plunge pickling onions into boiling water for 1
minute (this makes them easier to peel). Peel onions, leaving bases
intact, and make a small cross with a sharp knife in each base to
prevent onions falling apart. Strain reduced stock, discarding solids
and grease, return to heat and thicken with buerre manie if
necessary. Taste for salt and pepper and sharpen to taste with a
little vinegar Add pickling onions and cook over low heat until
almost tender.  Add parsnips, sausage and duck pieces and heat
through.  Serve with Barossa ribbon noodles. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef.
