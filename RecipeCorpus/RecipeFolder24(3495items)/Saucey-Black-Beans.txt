Title: Saucey Black Beans
Categories: Beans, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
2    16 oz cans stewed or canned
Tomatoes
1 t  Molido (dried Mexican
Oregeno)
4    Cloves minced garlic
4 c  Dry black beans, soaked
Overnight
12 c  Water
1 x  Grated peel from one orange
4    Vidalia onions, chopped
1/2 cn Mild green chilis
Drain the soaking water from the beans and add the 12c water.  Bring
to a boil, reduce heat and cook at a fast simmer for 1 to 1 1/2
hours, when beans just start to get soft. Add all other ingredients
except the molido and cook until beans are truly soft. Add molido,
stir in well, turn off burner and allow to sit for 30 minutes. Serve
over rice or corn bread, or use in enchiladas.

Beans behave slightly differently with every batch I buy, so adjust
the cooking time according to taste.  I can tell by the smell that
they are done. If the beans seem too liquid, leave the lid off after
adding the onions and allow them to cook down.

NOTE:  I personally prefer 2t of molido, but this is a bit much for
some folks. I'll bet it would be good with the fresh stuff, if I
could ever find it!
