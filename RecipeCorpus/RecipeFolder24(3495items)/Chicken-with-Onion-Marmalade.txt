Yield: 6 servings
1 T  Honey
Parsley sprigs (opt)
Salt

6    Chicken breast halves*
3 T  Cream sherry
2    Red onions,medium-size
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1 T  Red wine vinegar

1. Rinse chicken and put in a heavy plastic food bag; add 2
tablespoons sherry. Seal bag; rotate. Chill at least 30 minutes or up
to 6 hours; turn over several times.

2. Meanwhile, thinly slice onions; wrap several slices airtight and
chill up to 6 hours. In a 10-12" frying pan over medium-high heat,
combine remaining onion slices, wine, vinegar, and honey. Stir often
until liquid evaporates. (If made ahead, cover and set aside up to 6
hours; stir over medium-high heat to warm.) Remove from heat and mix
in remaining 1 tablespoon sherry.

3. Arrange breasts in a single layer with marinating liquid in a
9x13" pan. Bake, uncovered, in a 450'F. oven just until meat is white
in thickest part (cut to test), 12-15 minutes. With a slotted spoon,
transfer chicken to a warm platter. Spoon onion mixture over chicken.
Garnish with reserved onion slices and parsley. Add salt and pepper
to taste.
