Title: Navajo and Pueblo Indian Fry Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1 c  Lard OR oil for frying
4 c  White flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
Mix dry ingredients together. Add warm water to dry ingredients. Knead
until dough is soft and elastic and does not stick to bowl. If
necessary, add a little more warm water. Shape dough into balls the
size of a small peach. Let these sit for 15 minutes. Pat out a bit,
pinch edges and then pat back and forth by hand until dough is about
1/2-3/4" thick and is round. Make a small hole in the center of the
round. Melt lard in a heavy frying pan. Carefully, put rounds into
hot fat, one at a time. Brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
Serve hot. Submitted By WESLEY PITTS   On   10-15-94
