Sprinkle the cavity with salt. Mix the onion, garlic, pecans,
mushrooms, & tangerines together. Stuff each hen with this mixture.
Heat the liquid mixture until it begins to boil. Turn off & let cool
for 5 minutes. Pour 2 Tblspns of this into each hen. Preheat oven to
325 degrees F then bake hens for 45 minutes. Be sure to baste every
10 minutes with the liquid mixture. Test birds...if not done....cook
until done. **NOTE** I have used this same thing on chickens too as
well Guinea hens. All came out well as did the quail I used it with.
Origin: Don Houston's kitchen...circa 1970-something

NANCY O'BRION NOTES:  I included this because IT gave me good
practice to work a round a ricepe to make it work for ME and
MINE!(very big smile) What I figure the food exchange by hotkey it
(y)ield and then say yes the next question( just be sure that you
write or remember what the orginally serving was in this case it was
4 serving) I would make this about 1 meat exchange(depending on what
I use of poulty) and 1 fruit (depanding how big tangerine because of
the orange juice) and 1 fat exchange. Make it work!!!! For it it will
not be the same old thing!
