This is a very simple recipe, but one guaranteed to make one think
seriously about cutting tomatoes off the vine prematurely just to make
these goodies.

To prepare batter:
Mix flour, corn meal and milk in a large bowl. Add salt and
pepper to taste. Batter should be thick but workable. Too thin a
batter will not stick to the tomatoes. Let rest for 10 - 15 minutes
before using.
Meanwhile, slice tomatoes about 3/8" thick. Any size fruit will
work, but the larger the tomato, the more spectacular will be the
result. Coat tomatoes with the batter and fry in about 1/2 an inch of
oil, until golden: 375 in an electric fryingpan, or at medium high
heat in a large skillet. When tomatoes are done, stand them up on
their edges to drain in a towel-lined pan so they will keep their
crispness. Delicious hot or room temperature.
