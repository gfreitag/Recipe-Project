MMMMM------------------------LEMON CHEESE-----------------------------
6 ea Egg yolks
100 g  Butter
Juice and rind of 3 lemons
6 T  Castor sugar
finely cut julienne from the zest of 1 lemon (be careful to take the
yellow skin only) 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup sugar To make pastry cases:
put flour, butter and icing sugar in food processor, process until
mixture forms a ball.  Remove from proces- sor bowl, wrap in plastic
wrap and stand in refrigerator for 2 hours. Lightly butter 24 muffin
tins. Roll out pastry, in small amounts at a time, and cut with 7 cm
round cutter. This will give you deep tarts. Line tins with pastry
rounds and cook on second bottom shelf of pre-heated 190'C oven for
12 to 15 minutes. Tart cases will keep two or three days in covered
container. Lemon cheese: put lemon juice and rind, sugar and egg
yolks in saucepan and beat together well. Add butter, cook over a low
flame, stirring all the time, until mixture thickens. Pour into
container, cool, store in refigerator. To make garnish: boil
julienned zest of lemon in water for 3 or 4 minutes. Drain. Put water
and sugar in saucepan and cook until boiling. Drop in lemon julienne
and cook until syrup thickens. Drain zest and spread out on a plate
to cool. Put a piece of the garnish on top of each filled tart. Tarts
should be filled immediately before serving. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef.
