Yield: 1 servings
1 T  Bitters (optional)
1 t  Ground cinnamon
1/2 t  Ground ginger
1/2 t  Salt
1/4 t  Grated nutmeg
1/4 t  Ground cloves
1 ea Egg, beaten
1 ea 12-ounce can evaporated milk
1/4 c  Milk
1 c  Water
Praline (optional)
2 T  (1/4 stick) butter, softened
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1/3 c  Chopped pecans
2 ea Unbaked 8 inch pie shells,
-or one unbaked 10 inch
2 T  (1/4 stick butter
1 ea 29 ounce can pumpkin puree
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 T  All purpose flour
Prepare the praline filling, if desired.  Preheat oven to 450 F.  In a
small bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar.  Blend in
pecans. Press firmly into the bottom of the unbaked pie shells.  Bake
for 10 minutes, watching carefully so crusts do not puff up or slip
down. Prick puffs with a fork if you see this happening, and pat the
slipping crusts back up in place with the back of a fork. Preheat
oven to 400 F. Melt the butter in a large skillet; add the pumpkin
puree. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring now and then with a wooden
spoon. In a large mixer bowl, mix together the next 9 ingredients.
Add the egg, and mix again. Add the hot pumpkin gradually, then blend
in the milks and water. Pour into pie shells and bake for 1 hour. Let
cool completely before cutting. The filling can be made a day in
advance and refrigerated.  If you've used the praline, you may have
extra pumpkin filling, bake it in individual custard cups. From:
