James Beard's Old-Fashioned Chicken & Dumplings

Makes: 4 to 8 servings.

Follow the recipe for poached chicken in Double Chicken Broth. :
See: Double Chicken Broth Stock recipe.

In this recipe you leave the chicken in the pot and add the
dumplings, as described below, then serve the chicken and dumplings.

* Directions for Dumplings *

While the chicken is cooking in the other recipe, make up the
dumplings, which will be added for the last 15 minutes of cooking
time.

Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the eggs and milk together
lightly and blend with the flour mixture to make a fairly stiff dough.

Form very small dumplings by taking a tablespoon full of dough and
rolling it into a ball shape. You may use the palm of your hand to do
this.

About 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time, remove the lid
from the pot in which the chicken is cooking and drop the rounded
tablespoons of the dumpling dough over the surface of the liquid,
spacing them a few inches apart as the dumplings puff up. Cover the
pan, keeping the liquid at a simmer, and cook the dumplings for 15
minutes, until light and cooked through. Do not remove lid while
dumplings are cooking.

Serve with the poached chicken.
