Title: Ginger Chocolate-Chunk Five-Inch Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 30 5" cookies
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Salt
12 oz Semisweet chocolate; chopped
-OR- bittersweet chocolate
2 c  Chopped crystallized ginger
1 1/2 c  Unsalted butter; softened
1 1/4 c  Light brown sugar; packed
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
3 lg Eggs; at room temperature
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

In a large bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed, cream the
butter. With the mixer on, add the brown sugar and granulated sugar
and beat the mixture until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Add
the vanilla and continue beating until combined.  Still beating, add
the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Onto a sheet of wax paper, sift together the flour, baking soda, and
salt. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and beat on
medium speed until well combined.  On low speed, fold in the
chocolate and crystallized ginger until completely distributed.

Drop level 1/4 cupsful of the batter 3 inches apart on lightly greased
cookie sheets.  With wet hands, flatten the cookies into
1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Bake in the center of the oven for 12 to 15
minutes, or until golden.  Transfer the cookies to racks and let cool.
