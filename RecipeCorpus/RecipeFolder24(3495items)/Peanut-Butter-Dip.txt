Title: Peanut Butter Dip
Categories: Dip
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Molasses
1 c  Vinegar
1 1/2 c  Sesame Seeds
5 c  Peanut Butter
2 c  Jam (flavour is at the
-maker's discretion)
Mix all ingredients, save the seeds, together until as smooth of a
consistency possible is achieved.  Add the seeds and stir in until
well-blended.

This recipe is best served with Bretton crackers, I find, but any
dipable cracker/chip will suffice.
