Title: Doughnuts
Categories: Breakfast, Doughnut, Dessert
Yield: 12 servings
3 tb Vegetable Shortening
1 c  Granulated Sugar
2 lg Eggs; Well Beaten
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Nuts; Minced, Optional
1/2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
-; Sifted, About
3 1/2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
-Sifted
4 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Mace
1 ts Salt
Sift the first 6 ingredients together and set aside.  Work the
shortening, with a spoon, in a medium bowl until creamy.  Add the
sugar gradually, while continuing to work the shortening until they
are light and fluffy. Add the eggs and blend them in well with the
spoon. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk, blending well
after each addition. Add the nuts and enough of the 1/2 cup of flour
to make a soft easily-handled dough. Chill for 1 hour or longer. Roll
the dough, on a lightly floured board, to 1/2-inch thickness. Then
cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Form the trimmings of dough into
a ball and roll and cut as above until you use all of the dough
possible.  Fry the doughnuts in 1 1/2-inches of salad oil heated to
370 degrees F. on the deep fat thermometer or until a cube of day-old
bread browns in 60 seconds.  Fry only as many doughnuts at one time
as float easily in the oil.  As soon as the doughnut rise to the
surface, turn with a long handled fork, being careful not to pierce
the doughnut. (If you do, it will make them greasier.) Turn often
thereafter until golden and done.  Remove with the fork, holding them
over the hot oil to drain, and place on brown paper or paper towels.
Serve as is or dust with granulated or powdered sugar or granulated
sugar with a little cinnamon added.
