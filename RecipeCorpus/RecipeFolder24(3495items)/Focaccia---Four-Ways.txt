This version of the popular Italian flatbread gets a head start from
thawed frozen bread dough.  It takes 25 minutes to prepare and bakes
in 8 minutes.

Cut dough into 6 equal pieces.  On a lightly floured board, roll each
piece into 5-to-6 inch circle.  Lightly spray three 12 by 15 inch
baking sheet with cooking spray. Place 2 circles of dough far apart
on each sheet. Brush circles with olive oil. Sprinkle with topping.
Lightly cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until
dough rises and appears puffy, about 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 475
degrees. Bake until puffed and golden. 8 to 10 minutes. Serve warm.
Best eaten same day; freeze for longer storage.
