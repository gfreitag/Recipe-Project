Title: Barley Risotto with Shrimp Eggplant
Categories: Italian, Main dish, Rice, Vegetable, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 6 servings
3    Japanese eggplant
10    Lg shrimp; peeled cut 4 piec
1/4 c  Grated pecorino cheese
7 tb Olive oil
1    Shallot; minced
2 c  Pearl barley
8 c  Vegetable stock
In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add
shallot and cook, stirring, until translucent. Add barley; stir to
coat with the oil. Reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking barley,
stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes; take care not to let it
brown. While barley is cooking, bring vegetable stock to a boil. Add
vegetable stock to barley, a cup at time. Cook, stirring frequently,
until liquid is almost absorbed before adding more liquid. Keep
adding liquid, stirring frequently until barley pearls are al dente,
about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes. Heat 4
tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute
eggplant, stirring frequently, until soft, about 12 minutes. Set
aside. Using skillet in which eggplant was cooked, add remaining
tablespoon of oil. Saute shrimp until pink. When barley is done, stir
in eggplant and shrimp. Add grated pecorino cheese. Serve. Source:
Odette Fada, Rex Il Restaurante, Los Angeles Fada's barley risotto is
easy to make. It's a great way to offer the luxury of shellfish.
Because the shrimp is cut into pieces, you only a half-pound of it to
make risotto for 6-8 people. Despite the shrimp, this dish is
predominantly grain. It's high in complex carbohydrates and fiber,
and low in fat. But it's so exciting that one hesitates to label it
with the stigma of "healthy eating." Best of all, here's a dish that
fits the proverbial champagne taste on a beer budget; in total,
ingredients for this risotto cost about $10. Add a salad and a cheese
course and you can feed a small dinner party for about $5 a head.
