Title: Souffleed Crepes
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 28 servings
1/2 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Butter; melted, cooled
3    Eggs; separated
1 c  Milk
3/4 c  Flour
These proportions make an eggier-tasting crepe.  Beat the egg yolks
with part of the milk, add flour, sugar, salt, beat well.  Add
remaining milk gradually, then melted butter.  Beat egg whites stiff.
Fold into crepe mixture.  They either may be cooked in the usual way
in a crepe pan or put into a large buttered pan and baked in a
preheated 375F oven for about 25 to 30 minutes.  This then becomes
something like a flat souffle that can be topped with a filling or
one can be put over half the batter, the rest poured on top.  It can
be a sweet filling like strawberries or apples and may be flavored
with lemon rind, brandy, or vanilla.
