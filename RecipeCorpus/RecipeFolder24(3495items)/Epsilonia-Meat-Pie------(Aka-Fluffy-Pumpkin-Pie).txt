Title: Epsilonia Meat Pie
Categories: Meat, Dessert, Pie/tart, Pumpkin
Yield: 1 servings
3    Eggs (seperated)
1 c  Milk
1/2 t  Ginger
1 t  Cinnamon
1    Graham Cracker Crumb Pie
Crust (homemade is best!)
1 c  Canned Pumpkin
1/4 c  Cold water
1 c  Sugar
1/2 t  Salt
1/4 t  Nutmeg
2 T  Melted Butter
1 T  Knox Gellatin
1)  Heat the PUMPKIN in a large saucepan until it is quite hot,
stirring occasionally.

2)  Combine the NUTMEG, SALT, GINGER, CINNAMON, MILK, BUTTER, 1/2 Cup
of SUGAR, and the EGG YOLKS (slightly beaten) in a bowl.

3)  Add the mixture to the hot PUMPKIN in the saucepan.  Cook this
until it gets somewhat thick, but don't let it burn or stick to the
bottom.

4)  While you are cooking the PUMPKIN/SPICE mixture, add the GELATIN
to the COLD WATER and let it sit for 5 minutes.  When the Pumpkin
mixture becomes thick add the GELATIN.  Cook further until the
GELATIN is dissolved.

5)  Cool the PUMPKIN/SPICE/GELATIN mixture until it begins to congeal
slightly.

6)  Beat the EGG WHITE until they begin to stiffen. (a few minutes in
the freezer will aid in this).  Add the remaining 1/2 Cup of SUGAR
gradually. Beat until the EGG WHITES/SUGAR will hold its shape.

7)  Fold the EGG WHITE mixture into the cooled PUMPKIN mixture.

8)  Pour this completed PUMPKIN mixture into the GRAHAM CRACKER PIE
CRUST and place in refrigerator overnight.  Sprinkle the remaining
GRAHAM CRACKER CRUMBS on top of the pie, it makes it look nice.

*****IMPORTANT*****

This pie does need to be cold and overnight refrigeration is best.
Keep cold till ready to serve.
