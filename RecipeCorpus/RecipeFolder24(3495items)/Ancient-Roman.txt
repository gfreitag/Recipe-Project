"In Pullo Elixo Ius Crudum"
1 sm Roasting chicken, cut up
2 tb To 3 tb olive oil (for
-browning chicken)
1 ts Dill leaves
1 pn Asafetida
Apicius's original recipe, translated by J.D. Vehling: Put in the
mortar dill seed, dry mint, asafetida. Moisten with vinegar, fig
wine, broth, a little mustard, oil and reduced must (fresh-pressed
grape juice) and serve.

Modern version: Brown chicken pieces in oil in a heavy skillet.
Transfer to covered iron casserole. Pound herbs together in mortar
and then mix with vinegar, wine and mustard. Add the wine mixture,
and salt and pepper, to the chicken and enough stock to half cover
the chicken. Bake for 1-1 1/2 hours at 350xF or until tender. If
sauce is watery, you may want to remove the chicken pieces to a
platter and reduce the sauce over high heat on the stove before
serving.
