Other names for taro are dasheen, elephant's ear, nampi, arum lily,
cocoyam, yautia, malagna, eddo and kolokassi.  Asiatic people steam,
boil or stew taro.  Hawaiians make poi from it and also stew the
leaves.

Peel the taro.  Soak in cold water until ready to cook. Boil in water
to cover, or steam in a bamboo steamer.  Serve plain as you would
boiled potato.

To season taro, drain and cut into cubes while still hot.  Combine
with chard and garlic.  Heat a wok or skillet with just enough
vegetable oil to coat the bottom.  Stir-fry taro mixture for 1
minute. Serve hot or cold with dipping sauce if desired.
