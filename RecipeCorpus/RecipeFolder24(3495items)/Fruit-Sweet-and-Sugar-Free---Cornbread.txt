Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9" square pan with lecithin
spray. With an electric mixer on medium high speed, use the paddle
attachment or beaters to cream the softened butter and fruit
sweetener until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time,
being sure that the first egg is incorporated before the next one is
added. Sift the dry ingredients together. Reduce the mixer speed to
low. Add the sifted dry ingredients, one third at a time, alternating
with the buttermilk. Pour the batter into the prepared 9" square pan.
Place the pan on the middle shelf of the preheated oven and bake for
30-35 minutes. When done the cornbread will be a rich golden yellow
and will spring back when touched lightly in its center. Cool the
cornbread in its pan on a wire rack. Cornbread is great eaten hot
from the oven. It is best stored at room temperature, well wrapped in
plastic. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   10-01-94
