Egg wash for rolls
To Prepare the Dough by Machine: ******************************** In a
small saucepan, scald the milk with the fruit sweetener over medium
heat. Combine the milk, sweetener, and softened butter in the bowl of
an electric mixer. With the mixer on the lowest speed, use the dough
hook to mix until the butter has melted and the milk and sweetener
have cooled to lukewarm. Now that there is no danger of cooking the
eggs, add them, the yeast, and 5 cups of the flour to form a soft
dough. Increase the mixer speed to medium and knead the dough for
5-10 minutes, adding only enough additional flour to form a
medium-stiff dough that comes off both the sides and bottom of the
bowl.

To Prepare the Dough by Hand: ***************************** Scald the
milk. Pour 1/4 cup of the scalded milk into a small bowl with 1
Tablespoon of the sweetener. When the milk has cooled to luke warm,
stir int he yeast. Set the bowl aside until the yeast is bubbly,
about five minutes. Meanwhile, pour the remaining 1-1/4 cups of
scalded milk into a medium size bowl with the softened butter and 2
tablespoons of the sweetener. When the butter has melted and the milk
has cooled to lukewarm, use a whish to stir in the eggs, the salt and
the activated yeast. Switch to a wooden spoon or your hand and stir
in 5 cups flour to form a medium soft dough. Sprinkle a little flour
on your work surface. Knead the dough, adding additional flour only
if necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Knead the dough for
10-15 minutes, until it becomes smooth and quite elastic.

Raising the Dough and Forming the Loaves or Rolls:
************************************************** Place the well
kneaded dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and
let the dough rise in a warm, draft free place until doubled in size.
Remove the plastic and using your fist, gently deflate the dough by
punching it down. Knead the dough in the bowl about 10 times. Cover
the bowl with plastic wrap again and let the dough rise until
doubled. Punch the dough down again and turn it out onto a very
lightly floured surface. Form the dough into 2 loaves or 24 rolls, or
a combination of both. Place the loaves into bread pans and the rolls
onto a baking-paper lined baking sheet. Place the rolls 3 inches
apart to allow room for them to spread while they rise. Lightly cover
the bread and/or rolls with an oiled piece of plastic and let the
formed dough rise until almost doubled in size.

To Bake the Loaves or Rolls: **************************** Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees. For Loaves, use a serrated knife to make a
diagonal slash across the tops of the loaves. Place them on the
middle shelf of the preheated oven, and bake for 40-45 minutes. The
tops will be golden, and the bread will slide easily out the baking
pans when loaves are done. Give the bottom of the loaf a tap. It
should sound hollow. Let the loaves cool out of their pans on a wire
rack. For rolls, prepare an egg wash, and sprinkle them lightly with
either poppy or sesame seeds, or leave them plain. Bake the rolls on
the middle shelf of the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes. The rolls
are done when they are a beautiful golden brown on their top and
bottom. Remove the rolls from the baking pan and cool them on a wire
rack. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   09-30-94
