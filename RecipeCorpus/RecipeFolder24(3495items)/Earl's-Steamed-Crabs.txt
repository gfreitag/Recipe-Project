Title: Earl's Steamed Crabs
Categories: Seafood, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1/4 c  Ground black pepper
1 c  Distilled vinegar
1 ea Bushel of live hard crabs
1 c  Kosher salt
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1 qt Water
1 c  Old Bay Seasoning
3 T  Ground mustard
In a bowl, mix all ingredients except crabs and water. I'll put them
in a container with lid and shake them so the seasonings are well
mixed. Set seasoning aside. In a large pot with lid (canners work
well), put a rack in bottom. Stones or bricks will do fine. Need
something to keep crabs out of the liquid. Pour water and vinegar in
the pot. Using tongs, put crabs into the pot. Make sure each one is
trying to bite you. That means they are alive. Between the basket and
the pot, run them under running water to wet the shells. Makes
seasoning adhere better. When you have a layer of crabs on the bottom
of the pot, liberally sprinkle with the mixture of seasonings. Put
another layer of crabs in the pot and sprinkle. Repeat this procedure
until the pot is full. Make sure every crab is well covered with the
seasoning. Put pot on stove at highest heat. You will probably want
to put a brick on the lid if the pot is full. Crabs react to the heat
for about a minute. In a couple of minutes the water in the pot will
begin steaming. I've never timed this part, but it must be about ten
or 15 minutes depending on the heat source. Anyway, when the crabs on
top are bright orange-red, they are done. Serve right from the pot on
paper covered table with mallads and table knives and LOTS of napkins
or paper towels. Bibs are helpful for messy eaters.
