Title: Gang Ba Curry with Mushrooms
Categories: Side dish, Stir fry, Thai, Main dish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Sugar, optional
1/2 c  Oriental basil, chopped
2 ea Kaffir leaves
6 ea Red chili peppers, cut into
-- 4 or 5 pieces
10 oz Straw mushrooms
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 1/2 tb Gang ba curry paste, see
-- recipe
2 tb Soy sauce
If the mushrooms are very large, cut in half; however it is
traditional not to cut them in Thai cooking.

Heat the oil in a wok over medium heat.  Add the curry paste &
stir-fry until it releases its aroma.  Add 3 c water, mushrooms, soy
sauce & sugar. Bring to a boil, adjust the seasonings if necessary.
Add the basil, kaffir & chili peppers.  Mix gently & serve hot with
rice.

NOTE: I make variations of this adding a bunch assorted, cubed
vegetables which I stir-fry for a few moments before adding the
water. Using the vegetables gives a main dish rather than just a side
dish. Good vegetables in this curry are: eggplant, zucchini, corn,
cauliflower, bamboo shoots (I'm not sure how Thai this ingredient is
though).
