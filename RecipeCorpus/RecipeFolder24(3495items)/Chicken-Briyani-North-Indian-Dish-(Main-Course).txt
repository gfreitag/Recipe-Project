A) Chicken Savoury Cut chicken into serving pieces. Heat half the
ghee in a small frying pan, fry almonds until golden; drain. Fry
sultanas for a few seconds and set aside. Fry peeled and halved
potatoes until brown, drain and reserve. Pour any ghee left in the
pan into a large saucepan, add remaining ghee and fry onion, garlic
and ginger until onion is soft and golden. Add chilli,  pepper,
turmeric, cummin, salt & tomato. Fry, stirring constantly for 5 mins.
Add yoghurt, mint, cardamom and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over
low heat stirring occassionally until tomato is cooked to a pulp. (It
may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry
and starts to stick to the pan). When mixture is thick and smooth,
add chicken pieces and stir well to coat them with spice mixture.
Cover & cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, approx.
35-45 minutes. There should be very little thick gravy left when
chicken is cooked. If necessary, cook uncovered for a few minutes to
reduce gravy.

B) Briyani Rice Wash rice well and drain in colander for at least 30
minutes. Heat ghee and fry onion until golden. Add saffron, cardamom,
cloves, cinnamon stick, aromatic ginger and rice. Fry stirring, until
rice is coated with the ghee. Add rose water and salt to hot stock,
pour over rice mixture and stir well. Add chicken savoury and
potatoes and gently mix into rice. Bring to boil. Cover saucepan
tightly, turn heat to very low for 20 minutes. DO NOT lift lid or
stir while cooking (Impt!). Spoon briyani onto a warm serving dish.
Garnish with almond & sultanas and serve immediately.
