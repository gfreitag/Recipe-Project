PREPARATION: Separate the skin and tendons attached to the narrow end
of the drummette and push the meat down towards the thick end. You
now have a "lollipop." Repeat procedure for the rest of the
drummettes. Mix with meat marinade and let stand for 4 hours or
overnight. Mix coating. COOKING: Heat oil in wok over medium high
heat. Coat lollipops in flour mixture, then deep fry until golden
brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. DO AHEAD NOTES: Lollipops
can be deep fried then frozen. To reheat, heat oven at 425 degrees.
Spread frozen lollipops on cookie sheet and reheat for 15 minutes or
so. A faster method is to thaw out and deep-fry again briefly.
COMMENTS: Do not overcook the chicken. It only takes about 3 minutes
or a little more to cook through. These make great hors d'oeuvres.
