Baking the Bread: ***************** Be sure to preheat the oven 15
minutes before you will need it, about halfway through the rising of
the shaped loaves or rolls. The loaves or rolls will be ready to be
baked when they have a spring to them when touched lightly with your
finger. Do not poke the dough this time or you will deflate your loaf
and you will need to reshape it. Loaves should also have risen over
the edge of the pans, doming in the center.

You may wish to glaze the loaves or rolls with an egg wash (made by
combining a whole egg with a pinch of salt and a 1/4 cup water) before
placing them in the oven. After brushing with the egg wash you can
sprinkle on poppy seeds or sesame seeds for extra flavour, texture
and appearance.

To keep well-kneaded dough from bursting at its sides in the oven, it
is wise to use a serrated knife to slash the tops of the loaves on the
diagonal.

Place the loaves or rolls on the middle shelf in a preheated oven and
bake according to the instructions in the individual recipes. Large
loaves usually take from 40-60 minutes; small rolls require half that
amount of time.

You may open the oven door to check on your bread after half of the
baking time as elapsed. If your oven cooks unevenly, you may need to
adjust the placement of the loaves or rolls for even browning. Close
the oven door as soon as possible to minimize the loss of heat.
