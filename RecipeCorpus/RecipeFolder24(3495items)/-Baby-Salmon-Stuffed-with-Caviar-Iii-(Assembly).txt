For the Salmon: ===============

Wash and salt and pepper the baby salmon.  Pipe the salmon
mousse into the inside of the salmon.  Add a line of caviar inside of
the salmon, then sprinkle with chives.

Close the fish.  In a saute pan, heat white wine.  Add shallot
puree and bay leaf.  Place the fish in the saute pan (belly down) and
bake in a 350 - 400 F oven for 20 minutes.  When fish is cooked,
remove from pan, remove the skin and reserve in a warm place.  Heat
juices in saute pan for a couple of minutes.  Strain juices into a
saucepan containing a wine butter sauce (see page 28).

For the Assembly and Garnish: =============================

Place the baby salmon on a serving dish.  Ladle some of the
salmon-flavored red wine sauce over half the fish and the wine butter
sauce (flavored with the poaching liquid) over the other half.

Garnish with cucumber, tomato, chives, salmon eggs, and crayfish
tails (boiled).
