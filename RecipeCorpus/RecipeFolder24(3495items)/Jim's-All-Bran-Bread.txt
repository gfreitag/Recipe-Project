Categories: Bread
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM----------------------MM BY H. PEAGRAM---------------------------
1 ts Baking powder
6 tb Golden Syrup
12 oz Mixed dried fruit
1 pn Salt
4 oz All bran cereal
12 oz Tea, hot and strong
1    Egg
12 oz Cake and pastry flour
In a large bowl, mix dried fruit and All Bran.  Pour hot tea over this
mixture and let stand, covered, overnight.

In the morning, add egg, flour, salt and syrup, and mix.

Divide between 2 well greased loaf pans.  Bake in a 350 degree oven
for 40-60 minutes.  Leave to cool slightly in pans and then turn out.

Will taste better if tightly wrapped and put in tins - almost
resembles a malt loaf.  Serve sliced and buttered.
