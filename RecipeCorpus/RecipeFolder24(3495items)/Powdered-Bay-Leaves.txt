Title: Powdered Bay Leaves

Yield: 1 batch
Bay leaves
Witty writes: "Spice packers used to offer jars of ground bay leaves,
but no more, alas.  So I grind my own, a simple matter for anyone who
possesses a little electric spice mill, or even a coffee mill that
has a horizontal, or 'windmill' grinding apparatus.

"Tips: Remove any bits of stem (these are hard to grind) and crumble
the leaves coarsely before starting to grind them.  Grind enough bay
leaves for a tiny jarful at a time, as whole leaves retain their
flavor longer than the powder does.  Pack the powder firmly into its
jar and store it away from heat and light."

Keeps for a few weeks in a cool, dark place.
