Rub pistachios together to remove as much outer skin as possible, then
grind roughly.  Cook pasta in rapidly boiling salted water. Melt
butter with cheese in a heavy-based saucepan.  As soon as they have
melted, add cream and cook very gently for 5 minutes, stirring
continuously. Remove from heat, add pistachios And cognac, pour over
drained pasta and mix thoroughly.  Taste for salt and pepper.  Top
with a few pistachios and serve at once. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef.
