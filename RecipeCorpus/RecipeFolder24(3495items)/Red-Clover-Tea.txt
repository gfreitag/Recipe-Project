Title: Red Clover Tea
Categories: Beverage, Herbs/spice
Yield: 2 cups
Fresh mint leaves (opt'l.)
-and/or-
Several dandelion leaves
;(opt'l.)
1    Handful fresh red clover
Blossoms, w/a few leaves
Lemon
Honey
Put the blossoms and leaves into a 2-cup earthenware teapot.  Fill
teapot with boiling water, cover, and infuse for 5 to 10 minutes over
very low heat.  Set the pot on a trivet over the burner, if
necessary, to protect it from breaking.  Strain into a hot cup, add a
twist of lemon and sweeten with honey.

Some fresh mint leaves and/or several dandelion leaves can be used
with the clover blossoms.

Note:  Red clover blossoms may be dried to use for tea.  Spread the
blossoms out into a single layer on a tray and dry them in the sun.
Use less of the dried flowers, 1 to 1 1/2 tsp. to 1 cup of water, to
make the tea.

Yield: 2 cups.
