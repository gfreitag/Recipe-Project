Title: Simple Orange Muffins
Categories: Fruit, Muffin
Yield: 12 muffins
2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cream of tartar
1/4 ts Salt
1 lg Orange
1 oz Tofu
3/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Oil
1/2 c  Water or orange juice
Preheat the oven to 350F.

Finely grate the zest from the orange.  Squeeze out and strain the
orange's juice.  Set zest and juice aside.

In a bowl, thoroughly mash the tofu with the sugar, or blend together
with an electric mixer.  Mix in the finely grated orange zest and
juice from the orange, oil, and water (or additional orange juice).

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of
tartar and salt.  Blend in the orange juice mixture.  Spoon batter
into muffin pans, filling each cup about 2/3 full.  Bake for about 15
minutes, or until muffins are starting to brown very lightly, and
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

Karen's notes:  I always use tofu as an egg-replacer in baked goods,
with excellent results.  It may only be luck, or coincidence, so if
you don't have a piece of tofu handy, try omitting it.

These muffins are pretty sweet, so you may want to decrease the
amount of sugar used.  The sugar does seem to act as a humectant
though, so the muffins will stay a little moister in storage if you
use more sugar.
