Title: Tenderflake Perfect Pastry
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 3 servings
1 T  Vinegar
1 ea Egg, lightly beaten
Water
6 c  Pastry flour, OR 5-1/2 cup
-all purpose flour plus 2
-tsp salt
1 lb Tenderflake (pure lard)
Mix together flour and salt.  Cut in tenderflake with pastry blender
or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse oatmeal.  In a 1 cup
measure, combine vinegar and egg.  Add water to make 1 cup.
Gradually stir liquid into tenderflake mixture.  Add only enough
liquid to make dough cling together. Father into a ball and divide
into 6 portions.  If desired, wrap unused portions and refrigerate or
freeze.  Rool out each portion on lightly floured surface.  If dough
is sticking, chill 1-2 hours. Transfer dough to pie plate.  Trim and
flut shells or crusts and bake according to your pie recipes.  Makes
3 9 inch double crust pies, or 6 pie shells. **MY NOTES** I ended up
using all the 1 cup of water/vinegar/egg mixture. I have really big,
deep pie plates that I use, so this recipe made two one-shell pies,
and two large popovers.  This is a great recipe for pie crust. I
usually end up throwing the pastry into the garbage and going out to
buy already made ones..  Now that I have tried this, I sure won't be
buying any again... 8-} Origin: Tenderflake box Shared by: Sharon
