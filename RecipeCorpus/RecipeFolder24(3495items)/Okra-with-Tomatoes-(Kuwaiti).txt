Title: Okra with Tomatoes (Kuwaiti)
Categories: Vegetable, Middle east, Side dish, Tomato
Yield: 6 servings
2 md Tomatoes
-- peeled & coarsely chopped
1 ts Ground coriander
1 1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Lemon juice
1 1/2 lb Fresh (or frozen) okra
6 tb Olive oil
4    Garlic cloves
-- peeled and minced
2 md Onions; peeled
-- cut into 3/4-inch dice
Wash okra and trim it.  (To trim the okra, cut off a small section at
the tip.  The stem end looks prettiest if trimmed in a conical shape.)

Heat the oil in a 10- to 12-inch skillet over a medium flame.  Put in
the garlic and onions.  Stir and fry until onions turn translucent,
turning the heat down if necessary.  Put in the okra.  Stir and fry
for another minute. Now put in all the remaining ingredients plus 1/2
cup water and bring to a simmer.  Cover, turn heat to low, and cook
gently for 15 to 20 minutes or until okra is tender.  (Large pods
will take a bit longer to cook though).

Serve either hot or cold.
