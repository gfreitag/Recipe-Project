Title: Fat-Free Gravy
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Diabetic, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1 pn Salt
1 pn Freshly ground pepper
1 pn Basil (beef) or sage (chick)
1 c  Broth & defatted drippings
2 ts All purpose flour
1 ts Cornstarch
1 ts Ketchup
A waist-watcher gravy - quite thin.  Serve over meat or potatoes.

Cook up bones as for soup, strain liquid.  Refrigerate overnight or
until white fat on top can be removed with a spoon.  Refrigerate meat
drippings from the pan and skim off the fat.

Combine broth, flour and cornstarch in a screw-top jar, cover and
shake until well combined or use a blender for a larger batch.  Pour
into saucepan, stir in ketchup, salt, pepper and basil for beef (or
sage for turkey, or other herb of your choice).  Stir-cook over
medium heat until gravy thickens.  (Mine didn't thicken but I had
some lumps of flour or cornstarch.)  Makes about 1 cup.
