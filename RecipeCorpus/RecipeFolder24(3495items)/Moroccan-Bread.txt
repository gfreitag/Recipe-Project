Title: Moroccan Bread
Categories: Bread, Moroccan
Yield: 4 loaves
2 ts Sesame seeds
1 ts Salt
1 c  Warm milk
2 c  Warm water (approximately)
Corn meal
2 tb Baking yeast
1 ts Honey
1/2 c  Warm water
8 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 tb Anise seed
Combine first 3 ingredients in a small bowl and allow to sit 2 to 3
minutes till yeast dissolves.  Stir and set aside on counter in a
warm place and allow to rise till mixture is bubbly and doubles in
volume.

In the meantime, mix the next 4 ingredients together in a mixing bowl
and heat milk to lukewarm.  Make a cater in the middle of the flour
and pour in the risen, bubbly yeast mixture and the warm milk and mix
in.

Add the warm water a little at a time to form a stiff dough (you may
need a little more or less than 2 cups of water depending on variety
of whole wheat flour used, humidity, etc.)

Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 to 15
minutes. The dough should be so stiff that it needs to be kneaded
with fists. Divide dough into quarters and roll each piece into a
ball. Allow to sit on floured surface about 5 minutes.  In the
meantime, sprinkle 2 cookie sheets with corn meal.

Form each ball of dough into a large cone shape.  Place 2 cones on
each cookie sheet and flatten each into round loaves that are
slightly raised in the centers, about 6" in diameter.

Cover loaves with plastic wrap and allow to rise about 2 hours in a
warm place.  Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.

Just before baking, gently prick bread around the sides in 4 places
and bake at 400 F degrees for 12 minutes.  Turn heat down to 300 F
degrees and bake another 30 to 40 minutes till bread sounds hollow
when tapped on the bottom.  Remove from oven and allow to cool.  Cut
each loaf into 8 to 10 wedges just before serving.
