Personal Note:

*Added by me, not in the original recipe. I made half of this recipe,
cubed the potatoes instead of slicing them. Had leftover smoked
sausage, sliced and added that toward the end.

Whole process took less than 20 minutes to prepare.  Added 1/2 cup of
milk to the soup to thin it down some.

Excellent
