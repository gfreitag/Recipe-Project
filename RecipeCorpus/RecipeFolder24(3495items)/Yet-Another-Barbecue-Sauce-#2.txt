Title: Yet Another Barbecue Sauce #2
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 gallon
1/2 tb Black Pepper
2 tb Red Pepper
1 tb Garlic Salt
1/4 c  Chili Powder
1/4 c  Worcestershire Sauce
1/2 ga Ketchup
1 1/2 ts Pork Drippings (bacon)
1/4 c  Vinegar
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 x  Bottle Heinz 57 Sauce
Combine all the ingredients and simmer until thick. When you use this
remember it is really a glaze, not a sauce. You can thin it with
Canadian beer before use. This is not as hot as it sounds but it is
spicy.
