* For a 2 crust pie ** Ground, or chopped almonds Wrap the salmon in a
piece of cheesecloth, tie securely with string and cook gently for
about 3O minutes in a court bouillon made of water, white wine, salt,
onion, peppercorns and carrot. Remove from the bouillon, unwrap, and
remove all skin, bones  and the black part of the flesh. When cool
enough to handle, flake it with your fingers to be sure you feel and
extract all the bones.
Peel  the  figs  and  add  to  them the  washed  and stemmed grapes.
Crush the fruits together, using a wooden spoon, and season them
with the marjoram, cinnamon, ginger, sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
Grate or grind the blanched almonds, moisten them with the rosewater
and add to the fruit.
Now stir in the flaked salmon, chopped parsley and 4 tablespoons
melted butter.
Beat the egg white with a fork until frothy, then stir it into the
whole mixture. Line a 9-inch pie dish with pastry and fill it with
the salmon mixture. Cover with more pastry. Trim, roll under and
crimp the edges. Make 5 or 6  generous slits in the top crust and
place in a 350 ^ F. oven. Bake for about 20 minutes, turn the
regulator to 400^ F. and continue baking until it looks done, or for
about 45 minutes in all. Serve at once with white wine. Source:
