4 ounces semisweet chocolate 1 tsp vanilla extract 3 cups flour 1-1/2
cups sugar 2 tsp baking powder 2 tsp baking soda 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon
3/4 tsp ground ginger 1/4 tsp ground cloves 1/4 tsp freshly grated
nutmeg 1/2 tsp salt 2 cups mashed cooked sweet potatoes 1-1/2 cups
vegetable oil 4 eggs 1 cup chopped nuts

Butter and lightly flour a 10 inch tube pan.  Place chocolate and
vanilla in a small saucepan and set, covered, in a larger pan that
you've just filled with boiling water.  Sift together all dry
ingredients and set aside.  In a large bowl, beat the sweet potatoes
and oil together, then beat in the eggs one by one until well
blended. Slowly add dry ingredients and mix well.  Stir in nuts.
Pout one third of the mixture in another bowl and stir in the
chocolate, which should be melted smooth by now. Alternate the
batters in the tube pan, as you would for a marble cake. With a
knife, cut through the two batters to swirl together slightly. Bake
in a preheated 350F oven for 1 to 1-1/4 hours, or until the sides
have shrunk away from the pan, the top is springy, and tester comes
out dry. Let cool 10 minutes and then remove from the pan and cool on
a rack. if desired, drizzle with a thin confectioner's sugar glaze
(beat 2-3 tbsp boiling water into 1-1/2 cup confectioner's sugar)
