Prepare Chou pastry; in saucepan, pour water, salt, butter in small
pieces, and sugar. Bring to a boil; add flour all at once.
Mix vigorously with wooden spoon until dough forms a dry ball which
does not stick to the saucepan. Cool for a few minutes.
Butter and flour a cookie sheet. Preheat oven to 350F (180C).
Returning to the pastry, place the dough in a bowl fitted with the
knife blade (food processor). Set at maximum speed; switch on and add
eggs, one at a time. Run until dough is smooth. Let it cool slightly.
Pour pastry into sleeve fitted with 3/8 inch (9-mm) nozzle (or use 2
tablespoons).
Drop onto cookie sheet, leaving space between them. Brush with egg
yolk mixed with a bit of water.
Place cookie sheet in oven; bake for 20 minutes. Turn oven off;
allow chou to dry 5 minutes with oven door half open. Let them cool
on pastry rack.
Prepare the sauce; melt chocolate over very low heat in heavy
saucepan. Add butter and cream, still over low heat. Mix to obtain a
smooth, homogeneous sauce.
FINISHING: fill each chou with vanilla ice cream. Arrange them on a
plate. At table drizzle hot chocolate sauce over top.
