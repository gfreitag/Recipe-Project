Categories: Chicken, Poultry, Vegetable, Middle east
Yield: 4 servings
1    Fennel bulb; chopped
1/4 c  Parsley; chopped
1 tb Sumac*
2 tb Zhoug
2 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1 c  Onions; sliced

*Sumac is a spice prepared by powdering certain dried sour sumac
berries. While these are related to the sometimes poisonous varieties
of sumac, they themselves are perfectly harmless.  The sumac powder,
available in Middle Eastern and specialty food shops, imparts a
lemony flavor to foods.

Cook onions, carrots and garlic in olive oil in large Dutch oven until
onion is wilted.  Add chicken pieces and cover with cold water or
stock. Add the rest of the ingredients.  Cover and cook slowly until
chicken is tender and lentils are cooked, about 40 minutes.  Serve in
soup plates with the vegetables and a small amount of the soup.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
