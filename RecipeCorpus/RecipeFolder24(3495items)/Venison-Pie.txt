Marinade: 1 cup red wine 1 tablespoon walnut oil 1 tablespoon olive
oil 2 onions, peeled and sliced 5 cm piece cinnamon bark 1 clove
garlic, crushed 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pepper 1 teaspoon dried
basil filling: 1 kg stewing venison, taken from the shoulder and cut
into 5 cm cubes 3 tablespoons plain flour 90 g butter 3 large
tomatoes, peeled and chopped 6 pickled walnuts, sliced 2 teaspoons
angostura bitters Hot water crust pastry: 4 1/2 cups plain flour 1
1/2 teaspoons salt 185 g lard 1 1/2 cups water 1 egg Garnish: pickled
walnuts

To make filling: combine marinade ingredients in an earthenware bowl,
add venison, cover and allow to stand at room temperature for 24
hours. Remove meat from marinade, pat dry, toss in flour, then fry in
melted butter until lightly brown.  Place meat with marinade,
tomatoes, walnuts and angostura bitters in casserole dish, cover
tightly and cook very slowly at 160'C for 1 hour.  Cool.

To make pastry: sift flour and salt into a bowl.  Place lard and
water in a saucepan, bring to the boil, then pour over flour and mix
rapidly until smooth.  Beat egg lightly and stir into pastry mixture
to form a smooth dough.  Wrap pastry in plastic wrap and allow to
rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.  Roll 2/3 of the pastry out and
line a single, deep pie dish or four individual pie moulds; fill with
cold, partially cooked venison casserole mixture, then cover with
remaining pastry. Decorate top if desired, glaze with beaten egg,
then bake at 200'C for 30 minutes. Reduce temperature to 180'C and
bake large pie for a further 1 1/2 hours, and smaller pies for a
further 30 minutes. Can be served hot or cold with whole pickled
walnuts as garnish. Sue Forster. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef. Magnus
