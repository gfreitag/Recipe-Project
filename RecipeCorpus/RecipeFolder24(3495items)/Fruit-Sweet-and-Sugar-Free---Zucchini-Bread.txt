Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Zucchini Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
3/4 c  Oil
3    Eggs
1 T  Vanilla extract
2 1/4 c  Grated and drained zucchini
1/4 c  Zucchini water
1/3 c  Fruit sweetener
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 t  Baking soda
3/4 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Salt
3/4 c  Walnuts
2 1/3 c  Unbleached white flour
4 t  Cinnamon
3/4 t  Nutmeg
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray a 9" square pan with
lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts in the oven for 7-10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool. Then coarsely chop
them with a knife or with the pulsing action in a food processor, and
put them aside. Grate the zucchini using a medium grater. Place the
grated zucchini in a sieve over a bowl and use your hand to press out
the extra liquid. This is the Zucchini water. Measure our 1/4 cup and
set aside. Sift the dry ingredients together. Use an electric mixer
on medium high speed to whisk the sweetener and oil together until
thickened. Then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each
addition before adding the next. Reduce the speed to low and stir in
the vanilla and zucchini water. On the lowest speed, add the sifted
dry ingredients alternately with the grated zucchini and the toasted
walnuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place the pan on the
middle shelf of the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes. A
toothpick inserted in the center of the bread will come out clean
when the bread is done. Cool the bread in its pan on a wire rack, but
don't cool it too much, for Zucchini bread is great served hot from
the oven. Store it well wrapped in plastic at room temperature.
