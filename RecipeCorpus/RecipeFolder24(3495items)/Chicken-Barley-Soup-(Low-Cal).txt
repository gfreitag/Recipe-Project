Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Finely chopped carrot
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1 tb Salt
1/2 ts Pepper, freshly ground
1/4 ts Celery seed
1 1/2 c  Green beans cut, fresh
3 lb Chicken, Cut in pieces
1/2 c  Uncooked barley

3    Celery stalks with leaves
1 sm Onion

Place chicken, water, leaves from celery and small onion in a large
saucepan.  (Reserve celery stalks.)

Cover saucepan and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours
until chicken is tender.  Remove chicken.  Strain broth into bowl;
chill until fat sets on top.  Remove fat.

Remove skin and bones from chicken, discard.  Cut chicken into
bite-sized pieces, set aside.  (My note:  if you want less than 8
servings, freeze extra broth and chicken separately in meal-sized
portions.)

Return broth to saucepan.  Chop reserved celery stalks, add to broth
with chopped onion, carrot, parsley, barley, lemon juice, seasonings.
Cover and simmer 20 min.

Add fresh green beans and chicken; continue cooking 15 min or until
beans are tender.  Each serving 1 1/2 cup.
