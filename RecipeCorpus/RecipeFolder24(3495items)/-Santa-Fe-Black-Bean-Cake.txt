Title:  Santa Fe Black Bean Cake
Categories: Main dish, Masterchefs
Yield: 4 servings
2 ea Chili, Serrano, seeded,
-- finely chopped
2 tb Chili, ancho, powder
1 tb Cumin
2 oz Oil, olive
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
1 lb Beans, black turtle,
-- cleaned, rinsed
1 sm Onion, coarsely chopped
2 sl Bacon OR
2 sl Pancetta
1 qt Stock, chicken OR
1 qt Stock, duck
Using a heavy-bottom pot, heat 1 ounce of olive oil, add the
onions and bacon and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the black beans and
stock (just enough to cover the beans), salt, and cook until
completely done.

Drain well.  Put the beans, onion, and bacon through a meat
grinder or food mill to make a paste.

Season the paste with Serrano chilies, Ancho chili powder, cumin,
salt and pepper.

Take enough of the paste to roll it into the size of a golf ball,
then pound the rolled ball between waxed paper until it forms a
1/8-inch thick cake.  Heat a seasoned crepe or teflon pan and add 1
ounce of olive oil. On high heat, cook each side of the bean cake for
about 1 minute (the cake will be crisp and should slide easily in the
pan when done).

Serve on a warm plate with sour cream in the center of the cake,
salsa on top of the sour cream, and cilantro around the cake.
