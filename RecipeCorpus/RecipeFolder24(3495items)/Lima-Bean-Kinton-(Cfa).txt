Orange slices offset the sweetness of this lima bean confection
which is served with green tea.

Peel skins from lima beans and mash beans.  Place bean pulp and
liquid, salt , and sugar in a small saucepan.  Stirring occasionally,
cook slowly until mixture forms a ball, about 20 minutes.  Cool.
Force mixture through a fine sieve or food mill.  Mix in enough
coloring to make a bright green. Roll mixture into 12 small balls.
Cut a lengthwise slit halfway into the middle of each ball.  Tuck one
orange section in each, pressing sides together to hold orange in
place.
