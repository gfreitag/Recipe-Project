in small quantities frozen mixed vegetable for soups, stir fries and
casseroles milk plain low fat yogurt parmesan and cheddar cheese
butter eggs **MY NOTES** I would probably go for avoiding the red
wine vinegar, chicken broth (in can) chickpeas, lentils etc, and
stick with what you would ordinarilly use yourself..  jams, flour,
sugar, salt, pepper, and the spices that you would use all the
time... along with garlic! 8-} Origin: Canadian Living, October 1994.
