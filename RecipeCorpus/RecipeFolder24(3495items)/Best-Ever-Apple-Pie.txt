The secret to a good apple pie is to use a few different kinds of
apples. When I make it, I use Granny Smiths, Macs, and Macouns. The
object is to combine sweet and tart, crisp and soft.

1. Preheat oven to 375. 2. Roll out the crust, line the pie tin
leaving a 1 inch overhang. 3. Mix both sugars with the flour,
cinnamon, and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the egg and the
water. 4. Toss the apples with the lemon juice, then the sugar, then
the vanilla in a large bowl. 5. Put the apples in the pie crust and
dot with the butter. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg
glaze. Roll the top pastry thin and lay it over the apples. Pull the
overhang up and over and crimp edges. 6. Brush the top crust with
SOME of the egg glaze. If you use all of it the crust is going to get
soggy. Cut slits and sprinkle with sugar if desired. 7. Put the pie
on a baking sheet and bake in the bottom third of the oven until the
pastry is golden and the apples are tender, about 50 minutes. Remove
from oven and let sit at least 15 minutes before serving.
