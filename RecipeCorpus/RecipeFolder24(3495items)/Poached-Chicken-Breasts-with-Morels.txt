24 dried morels 8 whole chicken breasts 2 cups beef consomme 4
tablespoons demi-glace 90 g butter 3 tablespoons oil juice of 1 lemon
snow peas for garnish

Soak morels in water overnight.  The next day, skin and bone chicken
breasts and cut them in half.  Heat consomme in a deep pan.  Add
chicken pieces and cook over moderate heat, turning chicken several
times and shaking pan.  The chicken should be cooked in 6 or 7
minutes. Remove from broth and keep warm.  Reduce consomme a little
over high heat, stirring constantly.  Add demi-glace, keep warm. Heat
butter and oil in a frying pan and morels.  Cook for a few seconds
and sprinkle with lemon juice. Remove morels with tongs and drain on
absorbent paper. To serve: arrange chicken on plates garnish with
morels and snow peas. Serve with the sauce. Carole Roet. Bon-Appetit,
