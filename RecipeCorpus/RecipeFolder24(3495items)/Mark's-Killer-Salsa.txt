Peel and chop coarsely, garlic, onions, sweet peppers, celery, and
carrots. Saute on low heat in oil(s) until softened, about 5-7
minutes. Stem and remove seeds from hot peppers, chop fine and add
after above is softened. Peel and quarter tomatoes and add to above
mixture,add vinegar(one cup or just barely enough to cover),salt,
pepper and sugar. Peel and dice potato well and add on top of
mixture. DO NOT STIR. Cook slowly over lowest heat, stirring only
occasionally and very lightly for 65-70 minutes. Add herbs and cumin,
stir lightly, and continue low simmer for another 25-30 minutes, or
until slightly reduced. Let cool, pack in jars and can(water bath) or
freeze in containers or freezer bags. SUGGESTIONS- This can be of
varying degrees of hotness depending on the type of peppers used. For
extra hot use red cayenne, serrano or jalapeno peppers, and for
killer hot leave the seeds in.

Any kind of sweet peppers can be used(red, yellow, green).
Vegetable oil may be substituted for the olive oil. Honey may be used
in the place of sugar. The potato is added to help thicken(commercial
prepared salsas use modified food starch). Add herbs and cumin
last(cumin gets bitter if exposed to too much heat), preferably when
salsa is nearly done.
Stir very lightly to keep a "chunky" consistency.
This is great on corn taco chips, eggs, in guacamole, or used as a
sauce for wet burritos. Keep a cool drink handy!!!!!!
