Title: Red Potatoes Roasted with Rosemary
Categories: Potato
Yield: 1 batch
-cut in 1" pieces
1/4 c  Olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 lb New potatoes, in 1/2" slices
6 lg Garlic cloves, minced
2 lg Sprigs fresh rosemary
Put potatoes in an ovenproof serving dish that has been well-coated to
prevent sticking. Lay potatoes in neat, tight rows. Sprinkle the
garlic over and position the rosemary around the potatoes. Drizzle
olive oil over all. Top with lots of freshly ground black pepper.

Bake in a preheated 350 F. oven for at least 1 hour. The longer the
better, since the potatoes become brown and crispy.

Food Editor Sarah Fritschner's 07/10/88 "Stephen Lee is One for the
Books" article in "The (Louisville, KY) Courier-Journal 'Magazine.'"
