Categories: Diabetic, Bread, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
6 tb Warm water
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 ts Salt
Combine flours and salt.  Mix water and 2 ts oil, stir into flour
mixture to make a soft dough.  Divide dough into 12 even pieces.
Shape each into a small ball.  Coat palms with remaining oil.  Roll
each ball in oiled hands. Place in a bowl and cover with a cloth or
plastic wrap. Let stand about 15 min.

Preheat an ungreased frypan.  Shape each ball into a very flat 4"
round patty.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 6 in circle.
Cook each round on preheated frypan until bubbles form on top, and
underside is flecked with brown but not too crisp and still flexible.

Stack cooked tortillas, cover with a dry cloth towel.  Serve
immediately or reheat in 350F oven before serving.

Cut in wedges and crisp to make chips for dips or serve with melted
cheese and chilies as nachos.
