Title: Chicken-Fried Steak
Categories: Meat, Beef
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Saltine cracker crumbs,
-rolled fine
1    Onion; sliced
1/2 c  Cream
2 c  Chicken stock (approx.)
1 ds Worcestershire sauce (opt.)
1 ds Hot sauce (optional)
2/3 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
Freshly ground Pepper
2 lb Top Round or Chuck Steak
- cut 1/4" - 1/2" thick
- (tenderized)
2    Eggs
2 tb Cream
MIX 1/2 CUP OF THE FLOUR, the salt and the pepper together. Pound the
mixture into both sides of the meat with the edge of a heavy plate or
mallet. Cut the meat into serving-size pieces. Beat the eggs together
with the cream. Heat the oil in a heavy iron skillet over moderately
high heat. Reserve 3 tablespoons of the flour. Dredge the steaks in
the remainder of the flour, dip in the egg mixture, and then into the
cracker crumbs. Add to the hot oil. Brown the steaks well, turn and
brown the other side. Reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet, and
cook for 15-to-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the steaks are
cooked through and tender. Chicken-fried steak should be well done,
but not dry. Remove the steaks from the pan, and drain on brown paper
bags. Keep warm. Add the onion slices to the pan and saute quickly.
Remove. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat in the skillet, and
stir in 3 tablespoons of the flour. Stir to incorporate any particles
in the bottom of the pan and cook for 1-to-2 minutes. Stir in the
cream, then the chicken stock. Season with Worcestershire and hot
sauce. Slice the meat across the grain and top with the gravy. It's
great served with mashed potatoes, homemade biscuits or cornbread,
and a green vegetable.
