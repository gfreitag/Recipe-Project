Categories: Beef, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings

With sharp knife, slice the roast into thin steaks.  Place a layer of
steaks in a large bowl or deep pan.  Pour a small quantity of soy
sauce over steak, sprinkle with a little garlic, sugar and ginger.
Add another layer of steak.

Repeat until all the steak is used.  Add more of the other
ingredients if necessary. If you use the wine or sherry, pour it over
all at the end, then add water to bring level of marinade over the
steaks. Wine can be eliminated and water only may be used.  Marinate
for a minimum of 24 hours. Turn steaks once in a while as you think
of it. Barbecue and enjoy.

This is a recipe my father used every summer.  It is wonderful as a
cold snack also, if you can save any for leftovers.

Note: unless you are dieting, don't trim off the fat.  It picks up the
marinade flavor and is WONDERFUL!
