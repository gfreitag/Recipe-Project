1 pk Wonton skins
in a large bowl, mix meat well with remaining BASIC ingredients. mix
until smooth.

Separate mix into four equal parts.  For each part, add one of the
EXTRA condiments -- mix well.

To stuff the dumplings, put about one overflowing teaspoon or pecan
sized ball into a wonton skin.  Fold into shape.  Possible shapes are
purse , fish , chocolate kiss, nurses cap, or whatever. Parts of the
wonton skin that are sticking out may get tough, so keep this to a
minimum. Use a different shape for each condiment so that you will
know what is what.

To cook, place on top of lettuce leaf on steam rack ( the leaf helps
prevent sticking).  Be very careful not to let them touch each other
or else they will stick.  Steam for 20 minutes.  Eat hot. Can be
frozen and reheated in microwave.
