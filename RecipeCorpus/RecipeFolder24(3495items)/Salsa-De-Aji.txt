4 lg Aji or jalapeno chiles,
This makes a light green creamy sauce which is served on the side in
Peruvian restaurants.

Combine the tomatoes, onion, and cilantro.

Place chiles, water and 3 tb. of the tomato and onion mixture in a
blender or processor and puree until smooth.

Add the chile puree to the remaining tomato mixture and mix well.
Salt to taste.

Yield: 1 to 2 cups.

Heat Scale: Medium.

Salsa Variations:  Ecuadorians are very fond of putting beans in their
salsa.  The most popular beans are the lupini, which are large white
beans about the size of lima beans.  Just add the cooked beans
directly to the salsa.

On several occasions, the writer encountered salsas with peanut
butter as an ingredient.  Add 1 tsp. peanut butter with the chiles in
the blender and follow the above recipe.

NOTE: This is a classic Latin American salsa, and the writer has
included some optional preparation methods which are fairly unique to
Ecuador and the Andes.  Although this recipe calls for the use of an
electric blender, one can follow the traditional method of using a
mortar and pestle.
