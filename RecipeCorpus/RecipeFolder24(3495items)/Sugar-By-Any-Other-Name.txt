The basic fuel of your food machine (body) is glucose.  It is vital
to the functioning of every cell of the body.  All carbohydrates
become glucose during the digestive process.  White sugar, as we know
it, is the combination of glucose and fructose.  When this type of
sugar enters the body, it encourages yeast growth.  Its action in the
body is similar to that of the brewer's yeast you bake with; when you
put the yeast in warm water it begins to grow, and adding sugar aids
the growth, making the yeast very bubbly and active.  Table sugar and
foods with high quantities of hidden sugar should be avoided as much
as possible. Luckily, you can avoid table sugar and still get all the
glucose needed to keep your body's cells functioning efficiently.
This can be done by eating a wide variety of carbohydrates, which are
largely made up of glucose. Granulated sugar is one of the most
commony overeaten foods in our country. Filled with empty calories,
it provides and initial rush of energy, but quickly slows the body
down.  Carbohydrates, however, provide slow burning fuel to prvide
long term energy. BY ANY OTHER NAME: These are all sugar. Sugar,
