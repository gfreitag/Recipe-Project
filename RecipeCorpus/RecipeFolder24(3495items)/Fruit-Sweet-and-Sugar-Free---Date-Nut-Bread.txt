Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Date Nut Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit, Nuts/grains
Yield: 2 loaves
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
1/2 c  Softened butter
2    Eggs
3 c  Unbleached white flour
1 1/2 c  Walnuts
1 1/2 c  Date pieces
1/2 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Salt
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray two bread pans with
lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts in the preheated oven for 7-10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool, then coarsely
chop them with a knife or with the pulsing action in a food processor
and put them aside. Combine the date pieces, baking soda, baking
powder, and salt in a small bowl. Stir in the warm water.  On medium
speed beat the fruit sweetener and butter together until light and
fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition
before adding the next. On the lowest speed stir in the flour and
then the date mixture and the toasted walnuts. Pour the batter into
the prepared pans. Place the loaves on the middle shelf of the oven,
and bake for approximately 1 hour. A toothpick inserted in the center
of the loaf will come out clean when the bread is done. Cool the
loaves slightly before removing them from the pans and cooling them
on a wire rack. Wrap the breads in plastic wrap and let them sit for
a few hours to overnight at room temperature before slicing.
