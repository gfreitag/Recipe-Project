Slice the bread on the diagonal to make oval slices.  Broil or toast
until golden brown.  Do not allow to burn.  Toast both sides.  This
can be done on a stove top char grill such as a Jenn-Air, under the
broiler of your oven or on an outdoor char grill.  When the bread is
toasted, brush lightly with a good quality olive oil.  Serve with a
prepared topping such as canellini beans or tomatoes with pesto.
