Title: Pecan Spice Cookies
Categories: Dessert, Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains
Yield: 40 cookies
1/2 c  Solid shortening
4 tb Unsalted butter, softened
1 c  Sugar
1    Extra-large egg
2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Light molasses
1/4 c  Ground pecans
2 c  Less 2 T unsifted all-
-purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Ground ginger
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground allspice
1/4 ts Ground cloves
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1/2 c  Sugar
Preheat oven to 375xF. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt,
ginger, cinnamon, allspice and cloves.

Cream the shortening and butter in the large bowl of an electric
mixer on moderately low speed for 3 minutes. Add the sugar in two
additions, beating on moderately high speed for 2 minutes after each
addition. Bet in the egg, vanilla extract and molasses. On low speed,
blend in the sifted ingredients, mixing just until all the flour is
absorbed. Stir in the ground pecans.

The dough will be soft. If it is soft, but still slightly sticky,
refrigerate for 15-20 minutes. (The texture of the dough is largely
dependent upon kitchen heat and humidity.)

Take up tablespoons of dough and roll into balls. Lightly roll the
balls first in granulted sugar, then in chopped pecans. Place the
balls 3" apart on parchment-paper-lined cookie sheets (about 8-10 per
sheet, depending upon the size of the sheet). Bake the cookies in the
preheated oven for 13-15 mintues. As the cookies bake, they will
first puff up, then fall into flat, crinkled rounds. Remove the baked
cookies to a cooling rack using a wide metal spatula. Cool
completely. Store the cookies in an airtight tin.

NOTE: These molasses-flavored cookies are crispy and spice-enriched.
Serve them with applesauce or poached fruit, or right from the cookie
jar.
