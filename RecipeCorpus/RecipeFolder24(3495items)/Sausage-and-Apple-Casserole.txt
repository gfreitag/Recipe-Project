Preheat oven to 375.  Pare and slice apples and potatoes. Slice
sausage. Fry sausage, save drippings.  Combine salt, flour, and
sugar. Arrange sausage, apples, and potatoes in layers in casserole.

sausage. Sprinkle casserole with sausage drippings.  Cover tightly.
Bake for 1 hour.

Sylvia's comments: I needed to use up a big can of apples (Sam's
size!) and this looked easy.  I fried and crumbled bulk sausage (less
than the original recipe) and didn't bother peeling the potatoes,
just sliced them very thinly (more than original recipe).  I liked
the modifications, the smaller amount of sausage was plenty
flavorful. Next time, I'll probably quarter the potato slices as
well, cutting them was a bit tricky. The kids liked it, too.
