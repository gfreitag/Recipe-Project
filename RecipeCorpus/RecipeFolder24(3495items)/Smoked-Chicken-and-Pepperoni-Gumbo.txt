Categories: Cajun/creol, Chicken, Meat, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Onion
2 c  Green pepper
2 c  Celery
-meats:
2    Smoked chicken breasts.
12    Inches pepperoni.
-broth:
6 c  Chicken broth
-Spice mixture:
1/4 ts White pepper
1/4 ts Red pepper
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Thyme
1 ts Dry parsley flakes
1/2 ts Gumbo file powder
-(optional)
-Vegetables:
Prepare vegetables. Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut
rest in fine chop (or use food processor).

Meats: two smoked chicken breasts, pulled from bone, skinned and
pulled into bite size pieces by hand.  If you do not have smoked
chicken, you may get away with using a small amount of liquid smoke.
I would guess no more than 1/4 teaspoon. one stick (about 12 inches)
pepperoni, cut into moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch or about
twice as thick as presliced pizza pepperoni usually is)

Preparation: Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and
singe them over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes,
stirring constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for
about 5 minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add
spice mixture and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry
roux. Add the broth and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to
medium low and simmer for at least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are
tender and flavors are merged. About 5 minutes before serving, add
the chunks of chicken breasts to the mixture. At the same time, add
more roux to thicken if desired.

Serve in bowl over lots of rice.

For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese
cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni.
Remove all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken
pieces.

Makes 8 to 10 servings.
