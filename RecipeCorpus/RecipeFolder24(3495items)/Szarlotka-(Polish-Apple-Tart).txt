Pastry: In a large mixing bowl, stir together cake flour, sugar,
cinnamon, mace, and salt. With a pastry cutter or your fingertips,
cut cream cheese and butter into the flour mixture until the mixture
resembles fine meal. In a measuring cup, combine 1/4 c milk, egg
yolk, and vanilla. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture,
add the egg mixture and stir with a fork until just incorporated.
Divide the dough into two portions, one slightly larger than the
other. Press to flatten into discs, wrap tightly and refrigerate for
at least 1 hour or overnight.

Filling: Place apples in a wide skillet over medium heat; cover the
pan. Cook until the apples start to sizzle; then reduce heat to low.
Continue to cook, covered, stirring the apples frequently, until they
are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in sugar and spices. Remove from
the heat and mash the apples with the side of a large spoon to make a
chunky puree. Let cool to room temperature.

To assemble: Set oven rack in the center of the oven; preheat oven to
350F. Lightly oil a 9-inch tart or springform pan or an 8-inch square
baking pan, or coat with a nonstick cooking spray. On a well-floured
surface, roll out the larger piece of dough into a circle or square
about 11 inches across. Loosely roll the pastry around the rolling
pin; unroll into the prepared pan, pressing it to fit the sides of
the pan without stretching. Spread the cooled apple puree over the
dough.

On a well-floured surface, roll out the remaining pastry into a
circle or square about 9 inches across. cut into 3/4-inch-wide
strips. Carefully lift the strips with a metal spatula and arrange
them in a lattice patern over the apple puree (place half the strips
parallel in one direction, then arrange the remaining strips parallel
in the other direction). Gently press the strips to adhere to the
edges. Trim the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice with the
remaining 1 tb. milk.

Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden. Cool in the
pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then carefully remove the pan
sides and cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the top with confectioners'
sugar.
