Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Angel Biscuits
Categories: Bread, Diabetic, Fruit
Yield: 15 biscuits
1 t  Baking soda
1 t  Salt
1 c  Cold butter
2 c  Buttermilk
1 T  Fruit sweetener
2 T  Warm water
1 T  Dry baker's yeast
1 T  Fruit sweetener
2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
3 c  Unbleached white flour
1 t  Baking powder
Place the warm water in a small bowl with the yeast and 1 tablespoon
of the sweetener. Stir until the yeast is moistened. Then set the
bowl aside until the yeast is bubbly, at least 5 minutes. Sift the
flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a medium
sized bowl. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch pieces. Use the fingers and
thumb of each hand to rub in the pieces of butter until the mixture
resembles coarse cornmeal. Be sure to lift your hands out of the bowl
while simulatneously using your thumbs to rub the flour and butter
across your fingers. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl,
combine the buttermilk with the remaining 1 tablespoon fruit
sweetener and the activated yeast. Pour them into the center of the
dry ingredients. Form a rough dough, mixing quickly and gently with
your hands. Cover the bowl with plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees, line a baking pan with baking paper.
Remove from the refrigerator that portion of the dough you want to
make into biscuits and knead it until smooth, 10-15 kneads. Roll the
dough out 3/4 inch thick. With a lightly floured cutter, cut out 2-3
inch biscuits. Place the biscuits on the prepared pan and bake until
golden brown, about 15-20 minutes. Serve Angel Biscuits hot from the
oven.

Angel biscuit dough can be kept in the refrigerator up to one week
before baking.
