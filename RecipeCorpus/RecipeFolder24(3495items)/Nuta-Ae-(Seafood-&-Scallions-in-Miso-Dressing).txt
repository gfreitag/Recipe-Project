1 ea Under cold running water,
-peel off and discard the
membrane of the squid.  Pat the squid dry with paper towels, slice in
half lengthwise without cutting completely apart, and spread open,
butterfly fashion.  Cut the squid lengthwise into 1/8 inch wide
strips. Over high heat, bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small
saucepan. Add the strips of squid and return to a boil.  Drain at
once, rinse in cold running water, and set the squid aside. 2. If you
are substituting clams, save the juice. If there is less than a cup,
augment it with bottled clam juice. Strain the clam juice through a
fine sieve into a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over high
heat. Add the clams, return to a boil, then immediately drain and set
them aside to cool.  Slice the clams into narrow strips. 3. In a
small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water and the salt to a boil. Blanch
the scallions by dropping them into the water and boiling for 1
minute. Drain at once and run cold water over them to cool them
quickly. 4. In a mixing bowl stir the vinegar into the miso dressing,
then add the mustard paste.  Mix until smooth. TO ASSEMBLE and SERVE:
Add the scallions and squid (or clams) to the miso dressing and stir
gently until the ingredients are thoroughly coated.  Serve at room
temperature in small bowls, as a first course or as a part of a
Japanese meal. Time/Life 'Foods of the World', Recipes: The Cooking
