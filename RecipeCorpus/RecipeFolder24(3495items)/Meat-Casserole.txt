Title: Meat Casserole
Categories: Diabetic, Main dish, Meat, Casserole, Crockpot
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 ts Pepper; ground fresh
3 ts Salt; (ugh) 1/2 would do
-nicely
1 ts Diet margarine;
1/2 c  Noodles; uncooked
5 c  Tomato juice;
4 c  Celery; chopped finely
1 c  Green pepper; chopped finely
4 c  Meat,cooked & cubed;
Heat oven to 350F.  Combine all ingredients.  Turn into well greased
(use a non stick pan spray by today's standard) carrerole; bake 2
hours and 15 minutes.  Again I think that this could be done in this
day and age the crockpot.  This was for 4 servings, but I made for 8.

This is a very old cookbook (1972) and it doesn't have the nutritional
values, only the calories:  280 per serving
