2 oz Olives, black, sliced
2/3 oz Green chilies, chopped
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
4 lg Bell peppers
1 c  Cheese, jack, shredded
1 tb Oil
1 md Onions, chopped
2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
1 c  Chicken, cooked; diced
8 oz Corn; frozen
Preheat oven to 350.  Cook onions and garlic in oil until soft.  Turn
off heat; mix in chicken, corn, olives, chilies, and pepper flakes.

Remove tops from bell peppers, then slice in half lengthwise, remove
seeds and membranes, and arrange around edge of casserole.  Add
cheese to chicken mixture and move immediately to casserole.  Bake 45
minutes.

Sylvia's comments: I used shredded cheese rather than cubed, and it
came out fine.  I also used about 1/2 the amount of chilies and left
out the red pepper flakes, since I don't like fiery foods.  But this
would be an easily adaptable recipe.  Stuff the bell peppers instead
of halving them for a different stuffed pepper recipe.  Leave out the
chicken for a vegetarian dish.  Add rice just to increase the
proportion of complex carbohydrates. Use peas instead of corn.
Endlessly variable! I think I will use more cheese next time, though.
