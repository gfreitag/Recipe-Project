Title: Welsh: Welsh Cakes
Categories: Breakfast, British
Yield: 20 cakes
6 oz Mixed currants and sultanas
-(1 1/2 cups)
1/2 ts Mixed spice or mace (opt)
1    Egg
A little milk
"Pice Ar Y Maen"
1 lb Flour (4 cups)
1 ts Baking powder
10 oz Butter (1 1/4 cups)
6 oz Sugar (3/4 cup)
1 pn Salt
Mix together the flour and baking powder with the salt, then rub in
the butter. Add the sugar, spice and fruit. Mix in the beaten egg and
just enough milk (about 3 T) to make it the same consistency as
short-crust pastry. Turn out onto a floured board, roll out and cut
into rounds about 3" across and 1/2" thick. Cook over a medium heat
in a very lightly greased pan or bakestone for about 3-4 minutes on
each side. If they brown too quickly, lower the heat, for the inside
must have time to cook thoroughly so that it has a brittle, sandy
texture. Serve either hot or cold with butter, sprinkled with sugar,
cinnamon, jam or honey. Makes approximately 20.

NOTE: Welsh Cakes are known in South Wales as `South Wales Cakes' and
regarded there as a speciality of that part of the country.
Esentially they are griddle cakes (called a bakestone in Wales), but
they can also be cooked in a heavy pan or skillet.

"An attention to cleanliness, not only in their culinary operations
and in domestic arrangements, but also where it is most essentially
requisite for health and comfort, in their dress, forms a prominent
and amiable feature in the North-Wallian character." - Sketches in
North Wales, J.W. Harding, 1810.
