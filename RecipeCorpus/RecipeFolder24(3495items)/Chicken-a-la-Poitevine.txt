Title: Chicken a la Poitevine
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Chicken, Casserole, French
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 pt Brandy
1    Head Garlic
Salt & pepper
3 lb Roasting Chicken
2 tb Butter
1 tb Oil
Joint the chicken into the usual 7 pieces (or buy 2-3 lbs chicken
portions). Separate the head of garlic into cloves and peel them.
Don't be put off by the quantity of garlic, it doesn't taint the
breath at all. Above all, don't reduce the proportion.

In a large casserole, heat the oil with the butter until the froth
subsides **BEWARE** Don't let the butter burn. A few pieces at a
time, fry the carefully dried chicken joints on both sides, turning
once only. You don't want to cook them, just brown them lightly.

As soon as they are all cooked, pour off the excess fat, trying to
keep any crusty bits in the pan. (I put a knife blade on the edge
just to let through the fat.) Return the browned chicken to the hot
casserole, and still over moderate heat, pour over half the brandy,
which you have warmed gently in a ladle. Set light to it, shaking
until the flames subside. **WATCH OUT FOR YOUR HAIR**

Reduce heat, pour over the brandy, add the whole garlic cloves, season
generously with freshly ground pepper. Cook 20-40 mins depending on
how well cooked you like your chicken done, or until tender.  For
modern broilers, 20 minutes is long enough for them to be tender. For
older free-range chicken, 40 minutes may not be long enough! You will
have a few tablespoonsful of sauce. Correct seasoning and serve very
hot. The garlic cloves will be deliciously edible.
