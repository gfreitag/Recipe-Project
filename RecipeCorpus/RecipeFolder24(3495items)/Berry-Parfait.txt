Berry parfaits - made with summer's best blueberries, raspberries,
strawberries and blackberries - are lightened by the use of nonfat
plain yogurt flavored with just a pinch of cinnamon to create as
luscious a treat as ever graced a soda fountain.

1. Cut 1 pint of the strawberries in 1/2" pieces. Place in a large
bowl along with the raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. Set
aside.

2. To make the sauce, coarsely chop the remaining pint of
strawberries. Place in a heavy saucepan with apple juice concentrate
and cinnamon. Cook for 10 minutes over low heat, stirring
occasionally. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, then
puree in a blender until very smooth. Toss 1 cup of the sauce with
berries in the bowl. Save the remaining sauce for another use.

3. To assemble parfaits, use six 12-ounce parfait glasses, tall
tumblers or beer glasses. Place 1/4 cup berries in the bottom of each
glass. Top with 1/4 cup yogurt. Next, add another 1/4 cup berries,
followed by another 1/4 cup yogurt. Finish with 1/2 cup berries.
Dollop each with 1 tablespoon yogurt. Garnish each with 1 reserved
raspberry and 1 blackberry and a sprig of mint. Refrigerate for 1-2
hours before serving.
