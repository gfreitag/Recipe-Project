-finest cutter on the
Shell and de-vein the prawns and wash them in a bowl of cold water to
which you have added 1 heaped teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda. Repeat
washing process.  Drain and dry on paper towels.  Remove the rind
from the bacon, cut each slice into two or three pieces and roll each
prawn in a piece of bacon.  Thread on metal skewer, leaving space
between each for quicker cooking.  Paint with melted butter, sprinkle
with ground pepper, place on the barbecue and cook slowly. Turn
frequently and paint with a little more butter now and again to keep
them moist. Do not overcook or they will be dry and hard. Pass
quarters of lemon for each person to squeeze over the prawns. To vary
this use fresh scallops or pieces of coarse fish such as ling, wrap
them in bacon and proceed the same way as for the prawns, The fish
must be wrapped carefully as it tends to fall to pieces easily. Brush
the fish with melted butter and a little lemon juice and salt and
pepper before wrapping in bacon.  You will need only 1 1/2 kg of fish
or 1 1/2 kg of scallops as there is no wastage with shells.
