Carbs:Use any of the following, depending on how "McDougall-correct"
(I've been learning a lot from you Barbara Z!) you want to be.

16 ounces dry fusilli (or any pasta, whole wheat is fine) boiled 1
cup dry brown rice, cooked (don't know how much it makes cooked)
combined with: 1 cup dry couscous (soak for 20 minutes in 1 1/3 cups
boiling water) -or, combine with any other grains such as quinoa,
barley,  or whatever you like ~I think this would also be delicious
and nutritious if beans (white, garbanzos, black) were added to the
pasta or grains-use your imagination and let me know how it goes!
