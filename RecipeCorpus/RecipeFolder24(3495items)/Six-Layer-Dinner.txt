writes: "This is a dish that Montana organic grain farmer Alice
Berner makes to take out to her husband, Bud, and the others when
they're working in the fields." The author suggests serving this
alongside roast chicken or grilled fish, or just with a green salad.
She also suggests a hearty bread and some lightly chilled Rose de
Provence. From "Farm House Cookbook" by Susan Herrmann Loomis.  New
