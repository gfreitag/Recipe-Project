Title: Trout Sauteed in Butter
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
6 tb Unsalted butter
Parsley sprigs
Lemon wedges
Salt and pepper
4    Fresh trout, dressed
A few Tbsp. flour
As every angler knows, skillet-size brook, brown, and rainbow trout
are never more tasty than when prepared this way.  Can there be any
tastier dish than the one that comes from this happy marriage of
fresh trout and butter?  But for best results, a few words of
warning: a basic rule of fish cookery is that fish, unless deep
fried, should be cooked slowly. Yet, at the same time, one wants the
flesh moist but with the outside golden brown. Furthermore one wants
to be able to serve trout whole, not in broken chunks, the result of
sticking. One other word: since trout are delicately flavored, I do
not "flour" trout with cornmeal but with flour. However, either way,
the trout will be delicious. Salt, pepper and coat the trout by
rolling them in the flour.
Melt the butter in a big iron skillet.
When the butter is hot (over medium heat) but has not yet shown
color, lay in the trout and turn the fire low.  A steady, low heat
will do two things:  cook the trout slowly  and at the same time
brown the trout.
You must police the process continuously, and it will take 15-20
minutes, depending on the size of the trout.
Just as soon as the flour coating has set on the down side, loosen
each trout from the skillet, shaking the skillet gently to keep the
slow browning trout free.
After 10 minutes of slow browning, turn each trout carefully and
repeat the above process.
When you serve the trout, pour a bit of the butter over each and
garnish with a sprig of parsley and a wedge of lemon. SAUTEED QUICK

If you wish, add a couple of pats of butter to the skillet after
the trout has been served, melt them, squeeze in a tablespoon of
lemon juice, turn up the heat, and stir.  Then pour this lemon-butter
sauce over each trout.
