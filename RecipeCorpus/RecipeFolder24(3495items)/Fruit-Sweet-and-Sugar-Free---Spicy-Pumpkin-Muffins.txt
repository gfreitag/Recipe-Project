Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly spray a regular size muffin
tin with lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts for 7-10 minutes in the
oven, stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool and coarsely chop
them with a knife or with a pulsing action in a food processor. Bring
1-1/2 cups water to a boil in a small pan. Add the raisins. When the
water returns to a boil, turn off the heat. Let the raisins plump for
at least 10 mintes. Drain the raisins, saving the raisin water. If
necessary add water to equal 3/4 cup. Combine the wet ingredients in
a medium size bowl. Sift together the dry ingredients into a large
bowl. Make a well in the center and stir in the wet mix. When half
mixed, fold in the toasted pecans and plumped raisins. Do not over
mix, batter should remain lumpy. Use a rounded #12 scoop (1/2 cup) to
place the batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake the muffins on
the middle shelf of the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn the
muffins once if necessary for the muffins to brown evenly. Turn off
the heat and leave the muffins in the oven with the door closed for
another 15 minutes. Let the muffins cool in the tin for five minutes
before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.
