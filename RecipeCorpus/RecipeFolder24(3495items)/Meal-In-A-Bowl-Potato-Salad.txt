Categories: Diabetic, Salad, Vegetable, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
1/2 sm Red onion; thinly sliced and
-separated into rings
1/2 c  Pitted ripe black olives
-sliced in half crosswise
1/4 c  Parsley; minced
1 1/2 lb Small red new potatoes
-unpeeled
1    Green pepper; seeded and
-sliced crosswise into rings
4    Hard-boiled eggs
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1 1/2 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt; optional
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/4 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
3 T  Fresh; dill snipped
1 T  Fresh lemon juice
1 T  Lemon juice
1 T  Olive oil
Steam the unpeeled potatoes until they are just tender when pierced
with a fork, but not mushy.  If they are very small, leave them
whole, or, when cool enough to handle, cut them in half or quarters
with a very sharp knife, taking care not to pull off the skin. Place
them in a large bowl, or on a serving platter surrounded by the green
pepper rings.

Slice the eggs crosswise, but remove and discard two of the yolks.
Arrange the slices over the potatoes.  Add the onion rings and
olives, and sprinkle the salad with the parsley.  In a small bowl,
combine the dressing ingredients.  Pour the dressing over the salad.
Either serve the salad as is, or toss it gently.  The salad may be
served at room temperature or chilled.  Source:  Jane Brody's Good
