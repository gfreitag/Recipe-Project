Categories: Appetizer, Thai, Snack, Vegetable
Yield: 30 rolls
1 tb Garlic, chopped
1/2 ts Pepper
2 tb Red curry paste
2 tb Soy sauce
30 ea Spring roll wrappers
3 c  Vegetable oil, for deep
-- frying
12 oz Tofu
5 ea Dried shiitake mushrooms,
-- soaked & trimmed
1/4 lb Green beans
1 ea Celery stalk
1/2 md Carrot
2 ea Green onions
3 tb Vegetable oil
Cut the tofu, mushrooms, beans, celery & carrot into large julienne
slices. Chop the green onions.  Set aside.

Put the 3 tb vegetable oil into a wok over medium heat.  When the oil
is hot, stir-fry the garlic until it begins to brown.  Add the soy
sauce, tofu & all the vegetables except the green onions.  Stir-fry
for 10 minutes. Turn the heat off & add the green onions.

Separate the roll wrappers.  Place the wrapper with the narrow side
facing you.  Place a scant 1/4 c filling about 1/3 of the way over
from the closest edge.  Fold the closest edge to you over the
filling, fold over the left & right edges & then roll.  Seal the end
using just a touch of water. Place the finished roll seam side down
on a baking sheet until all the rolls have been filled in this way.

Heat the oil for deep frying in a wok until hot.  Deep-fry the rolls
on each side until golden.  Drain & serve hot with cucumber pickle.
