2 1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Apple cider vinegar
3 lb Green tomatoes

Wash tomatoes, apples and peppers thoroughly. Trim and quarter
tomatoes. Core and quarter apples. Seed and slice peppers. Peel and
quarter onions.

Put vegetables and fruit through the coarse blade of a food grinder or
process in small batches in a food processor. As each batch of
fruit-vegetable mixture is processed into medium chunks, place it in a
large Dutch oven or roasting pan. Add all remaining ingredients to
the pot and stir with a wooden spoon to blend thoroughly.

Bring mixture to slow boil over medium heat, then simmer, uncovered,
stirring frequently to prevent scorching, for 30 minutes. Remove from
heat. Immediately pour relish into 6 sterilized pint jars. Fill to
within 1/2 inch of the top and seal at once. Cool before storing.
