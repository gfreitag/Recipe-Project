Title: Almond Granola Bars
Categories: Diabetic, Snack
Yield: 16 servings
1 ts Vegetable oil
1/3 c  Honey
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Almond extract
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
1/4 c  Oat bran
1/4 c  Finely chopped almonds
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 tb Vegetable oil plus
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray.

Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Combine remaining
ingredients and add to dry mixture.  Mix until all ingredients are
moistened.

Press mixture into a rectangular shape 7 inches wide and nine inches
long. (Wet hands or use one hand and a damp spoon.)

Bake about 12 minutes.  Remove from oven and cut into 16 bars using a
sharp knife.  Separate bars slightly and return to oven for 3 to 5
minutes more. The browner the bottom of the bars, the crisper they
will be when cool.

The edges will crumble slightly when cut - set aside for a snack.
Remove to a wire rack to cool.
