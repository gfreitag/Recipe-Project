1/2 c  Vegetable oil

To make the marinade: mix the soy sauce and honey together and add
spring onions, garlic and ginger.  Combine all other ingredients and
mix together well.  Use marinade with all types of white meat. If you
are cooking whole pieces of meat, the skin should be pierced before
covering the meat with the marinade.  To be effective, marinate meats
for at least 3 to 4 hours. Dry meats with a paper towel when taken
from the marinade. Put on an oiled and heated barbecue to cook and
baste with the marinade during cooking. To cook the quail: place in a
shallow casserole and cover with the marinade. Cover and leave for at
least 4 hours.  Strain liquids from the quail and set aside.
Barbecue quail, turning them fre- quently and basting them often.
The quail will be very tender and well browned when barbecued in this
way.  Serve with caramelised oranges. Jocelyn van Heyst. Bon-Appetit,
