Title: Mock Mincemeat
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit, Vegetable, Tomato
Yield: 10 quarts
2 tb Cinnamon
2 tb Allspice
2 tb Cloves
5 ts Salt
15 lb Green tomatoes
15 lg Apples
3 lb Raisins
1 c  Cider vinegar
12 c  Granulated sugar (6 lbs.)
Wash, core and chop unpeeled green tomatoes.  Grind tomatoes in a food
processor, food mill or the old-fashioned way in a sausage grinder.
Drain through a colander lined with cheesecloth into a pan.  Measure
juice after draining and discard.

Place tomatoes in a large enamel or stainless steel kettle; add a
measurement of water equal to the amount of discarded tomato juice.
Bring mixture to a boil.  Remove from heat and drain mixture as
above. Measure juice and discard.  Return tomatoes to kettle, add
water equal to amount of water discarded.  Bring to a boil and repeat
draining process. Return tomatoes to kettle and add amount of water
equal to discarded tomato juice.

Wash, core and chop apples.  Add apples, raisins, vinegar, sugar,
cinnamon, allspice, cloves and salt to tomato mixture.  Cook until
thick (1 to 1 1/2 hours), stirring frequently.  Mixture will stick
and burn quickly.

Ladle hot mincemeat into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1" headspace.
Adjust caps.  Process 20 minutes in boiling water bath.

Note: This mincemeat can be used as a pie filling for cakes, in
cookies or eaten as you would jelly on biscuits, English muffins or
toast. It also makes a great topping for ice cream.  One quart of
mincemeat is sufficient for a 9-inch pastry shell.
