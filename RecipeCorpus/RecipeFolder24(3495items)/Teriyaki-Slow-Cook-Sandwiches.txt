Trim excess fat from steak; cut into thin, bite-sized slic- es. In a

and garlic. Stir in meat. Cover; cook on the low- heat setting for 7

measuring cup; skim fat. Measure 1 1/2 cups juices (add water if
necessary); place in a saucepan. Stir together corn- starch and the 2
tablespoons water; add to saucepan. Cook and stir until thickened and
bubbly. Stir in the cooked meat. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.

the unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for
2 to 3 minutes or until lightly toasted. Top bottom halves of the
toasted rolls with meat mixture and desired toppings. Cover with roll
tops.
