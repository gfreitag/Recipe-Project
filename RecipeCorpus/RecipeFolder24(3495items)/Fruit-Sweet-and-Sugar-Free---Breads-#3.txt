Mixing and Kneading Bread Dough: ******************************** The
main differences between preparing dough by hand and preparing it by
machine are the amount of time required to properly knead the dough
and the amount of effort you will need to expend. Once the dough is
in its bowl rising, the rest of the process is the same whether the
dough has been kneaded by hand or by machine.

By Hand: ******** When preparing dough by hand, activate the yeast
before beginning, by stirring the yeast into 1/4 cup of the liquid
and 1 teaspoon of sweetener called for in the recipe. The best
temperature for this liquid is approximately 105 degrees, which
should feel warm to the touch. Let the yeast activate itself
undisturbed for a few minutes until it is bubbly and fragrant, while
you prepare the other ingredients.

Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, making a well in
the center. Pour in the wet ingredients and the yeast mixture. Use a
wooden spoon, a rubber spatula, or your hand to begin stirring in a
spiral motion from the center, gradually stirring in wider and winder
spirals, incorporating a little more flour with each outward spiral.
Once the mixture feels like a thick batter, begin to use your hand to
incorporate the remaining flour into it. You will have a soft, very
sticky mass in your mixing bowl. Next, lightly flour your work
surface and turn the sticky mass onto it. Before proceeding further,
I usually wash my hands to remove any bits of dough clinging to them,
and then dry them and lightly dust them with flour.
