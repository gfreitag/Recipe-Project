Title: Dried Pear, Port and Poppy Seed Loaf
Categories: Bread, Fruit
Yield: 1 loaf
1/4 ts Salt
3 tb Poppy seeds
3/4 c  Unsalted butter; softened
1 c  Sugar
3 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
2/3 c  Plain, low-fat yogurt
1 c  Dried pears (abt. 5.5 oz.)
-- cut in 1/2" cubes
3 tb Port wine
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
-- (preferably organic)
3/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
Heat the oven to 350 F.  Butter and flour a 9x5" loaf pan.  Combine
the pears and wine in a small bowl.  Let stand 30 minutes.  Drain.

Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and poppy seeds in a
medium bowl.  Set aside.

Using a hand-held electric mixer at high speed, beat the butter and
sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Add
the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in the
vanilla.

On low speed, add the dry ingredients and yogurt, alternating in
thirds and scraping down the sides of the bowl, until just combined.
Using a wooden spoon, stir in the pears until just blended.

Pour into prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Cool on a wire
cake rack for 10 minutes.  Unmold and cool completely.

Fritschner writes: "This quick bread does not reflect the strengths of
Daniel Leader's book 'Bread Alone,' which clears up many of the
mysteries of yeast-bread baking.  But this somewhat sweet recipe is
good for those who love to bake and love good food."
