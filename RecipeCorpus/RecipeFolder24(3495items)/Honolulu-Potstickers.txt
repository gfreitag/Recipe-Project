hand and roll into thin, round pancake about 3 to 4 inches in
diameter. Place about 2 tablespoons cabbage filling in center of each

overlapping, in skillet. Cook over medium heat until bottoms are
golden. Reduce heat and add 2/3 cup water. Cover and cook until water
has evaporated. Drain any remaining liquid from pan. Place serving
plate over pan and invert so dumplings are served fried side up.
Repeat frying and steaming until all potstickers are cooked. Serve at
once.

Note: For miniature hors d'oeuvres, cut dough into 60 to 70 pieces to
form 2- to 3-inch circles.
