Title: Eggplant Salad, Rabat Style
Categories: Salad, Moroccan, Appetizer, Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Cumin
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Lemon juice
Salt
1 lb Eggplant
1 ea Garlic clove, slivered
2 tb Parsley, chopped
2 ea Cilantro sprigs, chopped
1/2 ts Paprika
Stud the whole eggplant with garlic s;livers using a paring knife to
"drill" holes in the flesh.  Bake the eggplant at 400F until very
soft. Remove from the oven & let cool.

When cool enough to handle, rub the skin off the eggplant & squeeze
the pulp to extract the juice, or scoop out the pulp & sit in a
colander to drain.  Discard the bitter liquid.

Mash the eggplant & garlic slivers (don't use a blender as it will
spoil the character of the dish).

Add herbs & spices & mix well.  Fry in the oil over moderate heat,
turning the eggplant often with a perforated spatula until all the
liquid has evaporated & the eggplant has been reduced to a thick
black jam. Sprinkle with lemon juice, taste for salt & readjust the
seasoning if necessary. Serve warm or slightly cooled.  Decorate with
baby tomatoes if desired.
