Categories: Jewish, Meat, Chicken, Italian, Main dish
Yield: 5 servings
1 cn Tomato Sauce (6 oz.)
1 cn Tomatoes (1 lb)
pn Salt
pn Pepper
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 c  Wine; red; dry
1 lg Hen; 4 to 5 lbs.
3 tb Olive Oil
1 lg Onion; chopped
3 ea Garlic cloves; minced
1 ea Celery rib; chopped
1 c  Mushrooms; sliced
DIRECTIONS:

You'll be sure to cut up the chicken in serving pieces. Then heat the
oil in a skillet and saute the chicken until it's brown. Add the
onion and garlic and push them around until they brown a little too.
Now you can add the celery, mushrooms, tomato sauce, tomatoes and
other seasoning.

Cook very slowly for about an hour; and then, 5 minutes before you
serve, you'll pour in the wine. When the thing's done, pour it over
noodles or spaghetti and get back on the diet tomorrow! This takes
care of 4 or 5 people...if you serve lots of "forshpeisa", you can
maybe squeeze out for 6.
