Title: Plum Tomato Tart
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 40 servings
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly
--grated
1 lb Plum tomatoes (about 8)
2 tb Parsley; fresh (chopped)
1 ts Thyme; fresh, or 1/2 t drie
1 lg Egg white
3 tb Olive oil
6    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18")
5 ts Breadcrumbs; dry
1/3 c  Dijon mustard
Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 400 degrees F.
Lightly coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or line with
parchment paper In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and 2
Tbsp. olive oil.
Lay a sheet of phyllo on the prepared baking sheet, and with a
pastry brush, lightly coat the surface with the egg-white mixture.
Sprinkle with 1 tsp. breadcrumbs. Repeat this step, layering 4 more
sheets of phyllo on top and brush with egg-white mixture. To form an
edge to the tart, carefully roll over the edges toward the center,
using the blade of a knife to help you get started.
With a rubber spatula, spread mustard over the surface of the
dough and sprinkle with cheese. (The tart can be prepared ahead to
this point. Wrap and freeze for up to 2 months. Do not thaw before
continuing.) Arrange tomato slices on top in 5 rows of 8 slices each.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Let
cool in the pan for 5 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the remaining
1 Tbsp. olive oil, parsley, garlic and thyme. With your fingers or a
fork, dab some of the herb mixture onto each tomato slice. Slide the
tart onto a serving platter or, if you wish to serve bite-sized
appetizers, slide it onto a cutting board and with a sharp knife or
pizza cutter, cut the tart into squares between the tomato slices.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

this easy-to-prepare appetizer." ~-From Eating Well, May/June 1993.
