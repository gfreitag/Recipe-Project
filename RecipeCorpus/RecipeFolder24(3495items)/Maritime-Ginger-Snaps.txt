Title: Maritime Ginger Snaps
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 4 dozen
1 t  Ground cinnamon
1 t  Ground cloves
1/4 t  Baking powder
1/4 t  Salt
1/2 c  Molasses
1/4 c  Shortening
1 1/2 c  All purpose flour
2 t  Ground ginger
Measure molasses and shortening into small saucepan.  With wooden
spoon, stir over medium heat until boiling.  Immediately remove from
heat. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

Measure flour, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder and salt into
large mixing bowl and mix until blended. When molasses mixture is
cool, pour it over the flour mixture.  Mix well.  Chill dough in the
refrigerator for about 10 minutes.

Place oven racks in center of oven.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Divide dough into quarters.  Cut each quarter into 12 equal pieces.
Shape each piece of dough into a very small (1/2 inch) ball.  Arrange
2 inches apart on cookie sheets.  Flatten balls of dough with bottom
of small glass, or with your fingers until the balls are the size of
a quarter.

Bake in 375 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes until crispy and dry.
Watch the cookies closely -- they can burn very quickly.

When the gingersnaps are done, use oven mitts to take them from the
oven. Set the cookie sheet on a cooling rack.  Let cool for 5
minutes, then remove cookies with a metal spatula to a cooling rack
to finish cooling.
