Title: My Mashed Carrots and Turnips
Categories: Vegetable, Holiday, Side dish
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Brown sugar
2 T  Butter
6 lg Carrots, peeled and diced
1 md Turnip, peeled and diced
Peel and dice carrots and turnip.  Boil in water until tender.  Mash
(as you would mashed potatoes).  Add butter and stir.  Add brown
sugar and stir.  Serve immediately.  If any left over, shape into
patties and freeze for future use.  (Microwave produces better
results from the leftover patties.) Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by:
