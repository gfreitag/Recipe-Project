Categories: Italian, Beans, Rice, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 T  Tomato paste
2 c  Cooked kidney beans
-undrained
2 1/2 qt Hot water
1 c  Rice
4 T  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 c  Olive oil
1    Garlic clove
1    Onion
1    Celery stalk
1 T  Chopped fresh parsley
3    Peeled plum tomatoes *OR*
Put the oil in a generous soup pot and saute the garlic until golden,
discard it.  Mince the onion, celery and parsley together, and cook
them in the olive oil until the onion is translucent.  Add the
tomatoes and cook on low heat for 10 minutes.  Add the beans and some
of their liquid, not much more than 1/4 cup, together with the hot
water. Raise the heat, and cook 2 or 3 minutes to flavor the beans.
Crush a few beans against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon to
make the soup thicker. Add the rice, stir, and boil gently for
approximately 15 minutes, or until the rice is plump and cooked.
Serve with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. From The Romagnolis' Table
