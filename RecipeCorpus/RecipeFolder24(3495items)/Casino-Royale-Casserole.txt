Title: Casino Royale Casserole
Categories: Casserole, Turkey, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 c  Cheese, Swiss, shredded
2 ts Juice, lemon
2 c  Turkey, cooked; cubed
4 oz Mushrooms
1/4 c  Cheese, parmesan, grated
1 cn Biscuits; refrigerated
10 oz Broccoli; chopped
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper, black
1/4 ts Nutmeg, groundd
1 c  Milk
Preheat oven to 375.

Melt butter in saucepan.  Blend in flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg;
cook 1-2 minutes. Gradually add milk; cook, stirring, until slightly
thickened. Stir in frozen vegetables.

Remove from heat; stir in cheese until melted.  Add lemon juice,
turkey, mushrooms and broccoli.  Pour mixture into a lightly greased
8"x8" baking dish; sprinkle with Parmesan and top with biscuits. Bake
20 minutes, or until biscuits are golden brown.

Sylvia's notes:  I used cheddar instead of Swiss and green beans
instead of broccoli.  Other than the few minutes to prepare the white
sauce, this was a quick and easy dinner, and a GREAT way to use up
leftover Thanksgiving turkey!
