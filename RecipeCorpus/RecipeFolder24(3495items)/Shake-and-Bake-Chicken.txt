Title: Shake and Bake Chicken
Categories: Chicken, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 t  Black Pepper
1 t  Poultry Seasoning
3/4 c  Flour
2 ea Eggs
3 t  Salt
2 t  Paprika
1/2 t  Savory
Put 2 eggs in a bowl and mix well. Then dip each piece of chicken in.

Mix the rest of the ingredients real well. Use a plastic bag to shake
the chicken. You can fry your chicken in a frying pan, but I prefer
to put this in a casserole dish with a bit of water. Bake in a 325 F
oven for 2 hour, coverd. It comes out so tender, sorry Colonel but
this is much tastier! Tested; We liked it, Lee
