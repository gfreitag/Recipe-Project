Title:  Spit-Roasted Suckling Pig with Vegetables
Categories: Pork, Masterchefs
Yield: 8 servings
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
1/2 c  Oil, olive
Vegetables, mixed **
1 ea Pig, suckling (@ 15 lbs)
Garlic, cloves, whole
1 c  Juice, lime
1 bn Marjoram, chopped
1 bn Thyme, chopped
** Bell peppers, (of varying colors), baby eggplant, zucchini,
summer squash, fresh green beans.

Rub the pig with lime juice, salt, pepper, and chopped herbs.
Put the spit through the pig, attaching the spinal column to the spit
with some wire to prevent the pig from slipping.

Skewer in place.  (Put a whole bulb of garlic on each skewer
before sticking them into the pig.)

Roast the pig, browning the skin gradually.  If the skin starts
to blister, decrease the fire's heat.

While the pig is cooking, baste it with olive oil flavored with
marjoram and thyme.  Cook for about 6 hours, then take the pig off
the spit and let it sit for 15 minutes.

Carve and place the meat on a serving plate.

Bake the eggplant on a grill until it's tender.  Grill the
peppers, then seed and slice them when tender.  In salted water,
blanch the zucchini, squash, and green beans.  Toss all of the
vegetables in olive oil, chopped herbs, salt and pepper.  Add
vegetables to the serving plate and garnish with garlic clove halves
from the skewers.  (The garlic will be very mild and tasty roasted in
this way.)
