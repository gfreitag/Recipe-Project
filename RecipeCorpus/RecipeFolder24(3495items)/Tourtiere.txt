The recommended Gluten-Free Pastry adds 184 calories, 1 starch
choice, 1 1/2 fat.  Try serving the filling hot with potatoes or
toast, or with a breadcrumb topping, or serve in a home made tortilla.

Stir-cook ground meat and onion until meat is no longer pink. (Regular
ground meat is much less expensive than lean.) Drain fat and return
meat to the pan, add spices and stock.  This will take about 15
minutes.

Stir in mashed beans and simmer until liquid is just evaporated, about
another 15 minutes.  Cool filling about 30 minutes if making pie
crust. Serve hot immediately, refrigerate cooled mixture up to 3
days, or freeze cooled portions up to 3 months.
