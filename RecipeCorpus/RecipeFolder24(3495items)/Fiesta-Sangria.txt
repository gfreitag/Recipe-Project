From "The Herb Garden Cookbook" (Gulf, $12.95), by Lucinda Hutson. If
lemon verbena or lemon balm are unavailable, mint may be substituted.

Place oranges, lemon, lime and other seasonal fruits in a large
container. Add wine, orange liqueur, brandy and herbs. Cover and
refrigerate at least overnight, or up to three days.

Fill a clear glass pitcher with sangria, adding more freshly sliced
seasonal fruits, frozen peaches and/or blueberries and fresh
long-stemmed herbs. (Soft fruits such as fresh strawberries or sliced
kiwi also may be added before serving.) Pour into wine glasses with a
splash of club soda or champagne, a tiny cluster of grapes and a
fresh herb sprig.

Makes about 40 4-oz servings. NOTE: Hutson says that if she uses red
wine in this punch, she also adds a long stick of cinnamon.
