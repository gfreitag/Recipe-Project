1    Stalk celery; chopped
1    Onion; quartered

MMMMM----------------------------SOUP---------------------------------
1 ts Dried basil;
1 ts Dried thyme;
1 ds Hot pepper sauce;
Salt to taste
Freshly ground pepper
1/4 c  Broken noodles; 1/2" pieces
1    Celery; Stack & leaves, chop
1    Carrot; chopped
3    Green onions; sliced
1/3 c  Zucchini; grated
My note: Remove bones from turkey or chicken before serving and
refrigerate or freeze until you have time to prepare the soup. I like
to do it the next day, if possible, and make a batch of crackers
while the soup is cooking.

STOCK: In stockpot or large saucepan, combine bones, water, bay leaf,
celery and onion. (Skin and drippings may be included, if desired.)
Simmer, covered about 4 hours. Strain, reserving stock. Let bones
cool, pick out any meat and add to the stock.

SOUP: In stockpot or saucepan, bring stock to boil; add noodles and
simmer for 5 minutes. Add celery, carrot, green onions, zucchini,
basil and thyme. Simmer for 10 minutes.  Stir in hot pepper sauce,
season with salt and pepper to taste.  Makes about 4 1/2 cups.
