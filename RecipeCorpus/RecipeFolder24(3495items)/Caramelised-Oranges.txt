2/3 c  Orange juice
1/2 c  Tawny port
1/4 c  Grand Marnier
6 lg Oranges
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Dry white wine
Peel the oranges, removing all the white pith.  Cut the oranges in
halves. Cut the peel in fine strips about the size of a matchstick
and boil in water for 5 minutes. Bring the sugar, wine and orange
juice to the boil in a small saucepan. Drain the orange peel and cook
in the syrup until the strips become transparent and caramelised.
Take care that the mixture does not burn. To serve: put oranges into
a serving dish and place caramelised orange peel in little heaps on
top of oranges.  Mix the port, Grand Marnier and left-over syrup
together and pour over the oranges. Jocelyn van Heyst. Bon-Appetit,
