1    Egg
50 g  Lard

200 g  Salted belly of pork

The milhassous is a sort of potato pancake. it is part of the
traditional cooking of the Correze - in the middle of France. In the
old days, it would probably have been used as a mian dish. Nowadays,
it is often used to accompany a game stew, such as a civet.

Peel and grate (on a coarse cheese grater) the potatoes. Drain them a
bit in a colander and put them in a mixing bowl with the lightly
beaten egg. Add salt and pepper and mix. Finely chop the onion,
garlic, some parsley and the optional sorrel. Add them too to the
potato mixture.

Coarsely chop the salt belly of pork (unsmoked bacon would just about
do, if not sliced thinly) and in a cast iron pan, fry in the lard for
about 4 or 5 minutes, to let the fat run. Strain out the pieces of
meat and add them to the potato mixture. Mix well.

Heat the fat in the pan well, and tip in the potato mixture, smooth
off a little to form a sort of cake of even thickness. Let the
milhassous cook, still on a fair heat, for 10 minutes or so, so that
a crust forms on one side. Now turn the cake over to cook on the
other side, either by tossing it (if you have the skill) or by using
a suitably sized plate. Cook another 10 minutes on high heat till a
good crust is formed.

Now put a lid on the pan, and cook in a low oven for 30 to 45 minutes
~ or longer if you wish in a VERY cool oven. Milhassous should be
crusty on the outside, soft in the middle.
