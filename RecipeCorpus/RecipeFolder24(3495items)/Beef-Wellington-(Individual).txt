Cook the first 5 ingredients in a frying pan till all liquid is
absorbed and mixture resembles a paste.  Cover tops of steaks.
Partially thaw patty shells and roll out thin enough to cover top,
sides and part of the bottom of each steak.  Cover with plastic wrap
and store in refrigerator till serving time.

Sauce: Cook over direct heat until reduced by half, the first 6 ingre-
dients. Strain mixture and cool.  Before serving;  in top of double
boiler over hot (not boiling) water, beat in alternately the yolks
and the melted butter.  Preheat oven to 425. Cook steaks on a rack,
uncovered, for 25 minutes.  They will be rare but will continue
cooking while sauce is added and dish is served.
