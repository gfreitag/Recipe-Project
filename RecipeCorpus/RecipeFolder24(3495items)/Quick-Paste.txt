Title: Quick Paste
Categories: Pie/tart, 1941
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Shortening, or butter
Cold water
3 1/4 c  Pastry flour
1 ts Salt
Directions Sift then measure flour, with salt.Cut half the fat into
the flour very finely. Cut the second half of the fat into the flour
mixture coarsely. Sprinkle the flour mixture with cold water mixing
it in very lightly, and using just enough to make the dough
holdtogether. Chill, or use directly, as required. (If desired the
fat may be worked quickly into the flour with the chilled fingertips;
this results in a paste which is less flaky, and rather closer of
texture yet very suitable for some purposes.)
