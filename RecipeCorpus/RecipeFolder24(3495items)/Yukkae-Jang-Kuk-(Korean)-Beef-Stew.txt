Title: Yukkae Jang Kuk (Korean) Beef Stew
Categories: Meat, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
125 g  Rice Vermicelli
2 T  Sesame oil
2 t  Chilli powder(or to taste)
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 kg Skirt or flank steak
2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Ground black pepper
24    Spring onions, sliced
1 t  Sugar
Put whole piece of steak into saucepan with salt, pepper and just
enough water to cover. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer until
steak is very tender. Allow to cool, then shred with fingers into
fibres. Return to the pot, add spring onions and sugar and simmer for
10 minutes. While simmering, soak rice vermicelli in hot water for 10
minutes, then drain. Add to simmering pot. Mix sesame oil and chilli
powder together and add to stew. The rich red oil will float on top.
Drizzle the beaten eggs into the bubbling stew, stirring so that it
cooks in shreds. Serve with hot white rice.
