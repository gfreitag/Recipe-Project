Soak the cloud ear mushrooms & tiger lily buds in 1/2 cup warm water
for 10 mins. Drain and shred the mushrooms. Cut the tiger lily buds
in 1/2-in. lengths. Have remaining ingredients measured & placed
nearby for cooking. Place the stock, salt, soy sauce, bamboo shoots,
pork, mushrooms & tiger lily buds in a 3-qt. saucepan Bring to a boil
over high heat. Immediately re- duce heat to low, cover the pan &
simmer 3 min. Add the bean curd, pepper & vinegar. Return to a boil.
Stir the cornstarch mixture to recom- bine it and pour into the
saucepan. Stir until soup thickens. Slowly pour in the beaten egg,
stirring gently. Remove from heat and pour into a serving bowl. Stir
in the sesame seed oil and sprinkle the choppped scallion on top of
the soup. Serve immediately. Pour the beaten eggs slowly into the
soup, stirring constantly with a fork until the egg forms cooked
shreds. Stir in the green onions, red pepper sauce, and sesame oil.
Serve hot in individual bowls. For a Chinese meal, it is a good idea
to have several dishes that can be started or completed ahead of
time. This hot and sour soup is just such a do-ahead dish, if you
wish, and goes well with most Chinese menus. Temperature(s): HOT
