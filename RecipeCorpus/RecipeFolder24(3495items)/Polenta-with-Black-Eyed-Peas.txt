3. Add beans (black-eyed peas), water and bay leaf.  Bring to boil,

until tender.  Drain, remove bay leaf, set aside.

5. Add reserved beans, tomatoes, basil, thyme and remaining garlic.
Saute' until heated through, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add lemon juice
and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving bowl and keep warm.
6. To make polenta: While the beans are cooking, bring water to a
boil, then reduce heat so water is just bubbling.  Using a wooden
spoon, slowly stir in the cornmeal.  Continue stirring until the
mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. 7. Stir in the Parmesan, pine nuts
and rosemary. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the
mixture is very thick, about 20 min. 8. Coat a 9x9 baking dish with
no-stick spray.  Add the polenta and smooth the top.  Allow to cool
for at least 30 minutes, or until firmly set. Refrigerate until
needed. 9. Unmold polenta and cut into 3/4 inch slices.
10. Coat a large no-stick frying pan with no-stick spray.  Over
