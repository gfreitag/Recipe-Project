The Basic Ingredients: **********************

Yeast: ****** Yeast is a living organism with very specific needs for
its growth and multiplication. Yeast thrives in the presence of
sweetener and warm termperatures between 80 and 115 degrees. Yeast
begins to die with too much heat; thus, the temperature of the
ingredients and the warmth of the place for the dough's rising are
very important. Salt, oil, and cold temperatures all inhibit the
growth of yeast, so you can place your dough in the refrigerator
overnight without its rising too much and it will be ready to work
with in the morning.

Yeast is available as active dry yeast or compressed yeast. Active dry
yeast is called for in all of these recipes. It is available in smal,
flat foil packets everywhere from supermarkets to natural food
stores. Yeast is highly dependable as long as it is fresh, so be sure
to check the expiration date on each packet before you use it. If you
are at all uncertain of the freshness of the yeast, dissolve it in
1/4 cup of the lukewarm water and 1 teaspoon of sweetener called for
in the recipe. If it is not bubbly and smelling strongly of yeast
after 5 minutes, dispose of it and begin again with yeast you are
sure about.

Flour: ****** Since flours vary in their ability to absorb moisture
and to develop gluten, it is hard to specify an exact amount of flour
in a bread recipe. Therefore all of the recipes suggest holding back
a portion of the flour and adding only the amount necessary to make a
well kneaded dough that is smooth and elastic and no longer sticky to
the touch or that comes off both the bottom and sides of the mixing
bowl of an electric mixer. In making the dough by hand, be careful
not to add to much flour during the kneading process. As you become
an efficient kneader, and lift the dough up off the table with each
turn you will use less flour than you did as a beginner.
