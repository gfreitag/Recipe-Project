Title: Chi Chi Triple Corn Muffins
Categories: Tex/mexican, Muffin, Vegetable
Yield: 10 muffins
3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Salsa verde *
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 tb Honey
1/2 c  Fresh or frozen whole kernel
Corn
8    Dried cornhusks (6-8 inches
Long)
1 c  Yellow or blue cornmeal
1 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
* Salsa Verde mentioned is a product put out commercially by ChiChi:
"This is a different kind of salsa, made with Mexico's tomatillos;
fresh cilantro and fresh onions.  Spicy and sweet"

Heat oven to 375.  Grease 2 1/2 inch muffin cups, separate cornhusks.

In large bowl, pour boiling water over cornhusks to cover.  Soak
about 10 minutes or until soft and pliable.  Drain, pat dry.  Tear
cornhusks lengthwise into two inch strips.  Set aside.

In large bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt.  In
medium mixing bowl, beat milk, salsa verde, oil honey and egg until
well blended. Stir liquid ingredients into flour mixture; mix just
enough to moisten dry ingredients.  Stir in corn.

Place two to three cornhusk strips in each muffin cup; crossing
centers in bottom of cups so husk ends fan out around sides.  As each
cup is lined, fill with batter.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until tops are golden brown.  Remove muffin
from cornhusks before eating.

Personal Note - wondering if you can just use paper baking cups in the
muffin pan if corn husks are not available?
