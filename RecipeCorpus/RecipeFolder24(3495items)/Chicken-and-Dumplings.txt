Yield: 6 servings
1 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Shortening
1/2 c  Skim milk
1 sm Chicken (1-1/2 lbs)
1 1/2 c  Water
1/4 ts Salt
1/2    Stalk Celery
1/4 c  Onion
Dumplings, recipe follows
Directions for Chicken and Dumplings: Disjoint chicken and remove
skin; place in large pan. Add water, salt, celery, and onion; simmer
1 to 2 hours or until meat is tender. Remove chicken from bone;
return chicken to chicken stock. Bring chicken and stock to a boil;
add rolled dumplings. Cover and boil gently 8 to 10 minutes.

Directions for making rolled dumplings: Combine flour, baking powder,
and salt.  Cut in shortening. Add milk to make a stiff dough. Roll
dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness and cut into 1 inch strips,
squares or diamonds.

Each serving 3/4 Cup, may be exchanged for 2 Medium Fat Meat, 1
Starch.

To make a chicken pot pie, put mixture in a deep dish, cover with a
rolled pastry dough to fit, making several slashes in the top. The
top crust would add calories to the total. You may add peas, carrots,
mushrooms if you like.  Those ingredients are not in the original
recipe. From files of Alice Broaddus 2/02/93
