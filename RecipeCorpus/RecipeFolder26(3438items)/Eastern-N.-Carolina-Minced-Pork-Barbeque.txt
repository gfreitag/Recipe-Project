Stir the Brine ingredients to dissolve.  Rinse and wash the pork in
running water.  Immerse the pork chunks in brine poured into heavy
plastic bags. Force the air from the bags and seal. Marinate the pork
for 12 to 18 hours in the refrigerator, turning twice. The meat
should "cure" to a light gray and become firm. Smoking: Prepare
electric smoke oven with at least a quart of water and a good handful
of wook chips or twigs. Use hardwoods or fruitwoods in the chip tray.
Soak them to prolong the smoke. Spray racks with vegetable cooking
spray. Place pork on racks without piercing with a fork.  Smoke the
meat at a bare sizzling temperature (175 degrees F) for 4 to  4 1/2
hours. Replenish the water pan or chip tray if necessary. Remove pork
and disconnect smoker. Allow the meat to cool for half an hour. Trim
the meat of skin and fat, and remove the meat from bones. Using a
large knife or cleaver, slice, dice and mince the meat.  The meat
should still be slightly pink, even when fully cooked.  This is a
characteristic of smoke ovens.  (The cooking is not completed yet,
however.) Simmer the sauce ingredients gently for 1 hour or until
slightly thickened. Allow it to cook, stirring occasionally. Blend
the minced pork with the sauce, reserving 1/2 cup of sauce for the
table. Pack into casserole dishes, cover, and heat in a 200F oven for
1 hour. Uncover, stir, and serve. EnjoyIngredients: Submitted By EARL
