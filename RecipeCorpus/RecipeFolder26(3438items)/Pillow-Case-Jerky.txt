Title: Pillow Case Jerky
Categories: Meat, Beef, Can/preserv, Jerky
Yield: 1 servings
Salt And Pepper
1 lg Boneless Butt Roast
Get as large a Boneless Butt as you can.  Cut the individual muscles
out of the meat and cut off and discard all the fat and connecting
tissue. Cut the meat across the grain as thin as possible.  1/16 to
1/8th of an inch. The thinner the slices, the easier it will be to
dry. Salt and pepper the meat generously on both sides, using more
pepper than salt. Lay out the meat strips on a cake or oven rack
without overlapping them. Set the rack in an insert fireplace and
cook on low heat for 8 to 10 hours, turning every 3 to 4 hours, until
dried. You can do the same with a dehydrator or oven, but it wont
turn out as good.  After it's done, store in a pillowcase. Don't
STORE it in plastic, as the meat has to be able to breath, and a
paper sack will leave a paper taste. From Cow Country Cusine By Kathy
