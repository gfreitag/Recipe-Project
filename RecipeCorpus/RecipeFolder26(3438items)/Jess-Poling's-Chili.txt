Title: Jess Poling's Chili
Categories: Chili, Ground beef, Main dish, Beans, Chilies
Yield: 20 servings
2 oz Green chili salsa
Sprinkling of oregano
3 T  Salt
1 ea Hot green chili
Garlic salt to taste
Black pepper to taste
4 ea Lrg cans Vista Pinto Beans,
-if desired
3 md Onions, chopped fine
2 md Bell peppers, chopped fine
3 ea Celery stalks, chopped fine
8 lb Sirloin beef, coarsely
-ground
2 ea # 2 cans stewed tomatoes
3 ea Cloves garlic, chopped fine
1 ea Bottles Gerbhardt Chili
-powder, 3 oz. size
Heat 1 tbsp oil, add onions, bell peppers and celery and cook until
transparent. Add beef and brown thoroughly, stirring often. Drain off
excess grease. Add tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, tomato paste (to
thicken), and two tomato sauce cans water. Add chili powder, and stir
thoroughly.

Add salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, and stir. Add chili sauce and hot
green chili and stir. Simmer on low heat for 5 to 6 hours. If chili
begins to stick, add water, stir often.

You may cut down cooking time, but, the longer you let it simmer, the
better the chili will be.

Some people will tell you if you cook with beans it is not chili. For
those people I say.....You cook chili your way and I'll cook mine my
way (VBGrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnnn).

If you want to add beans to this recipe, do so, I prefer the Sun Vista
Pinto Beans.

Served with homemade bread or French bread and salad makes for a
complete meal. This recipe will serve approximately 20 persons.
