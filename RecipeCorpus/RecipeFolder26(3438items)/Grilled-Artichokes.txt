Title: Grilled Artichokes
Categories: Diabetic, Bbq/grill, Vegetable, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
-- chopped
4 tb Olive oil
8 tb Water
2    Fresh artichokes
1    Lemon
2    Garlic cloves, coarsely
Trim the stems & the spiny tips off the artichoke, slice in half
lengthwise & rinse well under running water.  Scrape out the choke.
Using half a lemon for each artichoke, squeeze the lemon juice over
all the cut sides.

Using thick, heavy duty aluminum foil, make baking cups large enough
to hold each artichoke half.  Place an artichoke half in each cup,
cut side up, sprinkle with garlic & a drizzle of olive oil over each
one. Sprinkle with salt & pepper.  Add 2 tb of water to each half &
cover the artichoke halves with foil.

On a closed grill over medium-hot coals, grill the artichoke halves
for 1 hour or until tender when pierced. Kelly McCune, "Vegetables on
