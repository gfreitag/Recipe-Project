meat from kettle cut into crosswise slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Cut
from the top to about 1 inch from the bottom so that the slices are
apart but not separate. Place stuffing between slices. Skewer meat at
each end; bind the roast with heavy thread. Carefully return roast to
kettle. Sprinkle with a little flour and baste with drippings. Cook,
covered, over low heat, 30 mins. Remove to a warm platter. Remove
thread and skewers. Thicken remaining liquid with flour to use as a
gravy, if desired. Strain. Serve with boiled potatoes. Serves 8.





NOTES : An excellent Polish beef specialty is called pieczen huzarska.
Vodka may be used instead of vinegar to blanch the meat, if
desired. This is a good company entree.
