Title: Chinese Pork Roast
Categories: Chinese, Pork, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 tb Honey
1 c  Chicken broth
3 tb Vinegar
1/4 c  Water
4 lb Boneless pork roast
4 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 tb Soy sauce
Combine sugar, salt, honey, soy sauce and broth, pour over roast and
let marinate for at least one hour, turning occasionally.  Place
roast in shallow pan, pour sauce over and bake at 350 degrees for 2
1/2 to 3 hours (170 on meat thermometer).  Baste as often as you can
with a mixture of the vinegar and water to prevent sugar from
scorching, and to add a slight sweet-sour flavor.
