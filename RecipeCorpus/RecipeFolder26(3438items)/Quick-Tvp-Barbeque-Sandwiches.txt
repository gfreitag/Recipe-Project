Title: Quick Tvp Barbeque Sandwiches
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Bbq/grill, Sandwich
Yield: 1 servings
x  Water or other liquid for
Sauteing
x  Your favorite barbeque
Sauce
1 c  TVP
1/2 c  Water
1 md Onion, chopped fine
1    Or 2 cloves garlic, minced
Mix the TVP with the 1/2 cup water and set aside for 5 minutes.

Saute onion in about 1 Tbs. liquid until almost cleear.  Then add
garlic and cook for another minute. Add the reconstituted TVP. Add
the barbeque sauce until the mixture is the right consistency for
sandwiches. Heat thoroughly and serve.

It's so easy!  And if you want to avoid commercial barbeque sauce and
make your own, I'm sure there are a lot of good recipes for homemade
bbq sauce out there.  (Post 'em!)  Something strange (to me at least)
that is available here in South Carolina is a mustard-based sauce;
I'd never seen it before I moved here, but now that I've discovered
it, I'm addicted! It works great in this recipe.  If anyone out there
has a recipe for mustard-based barbeque sauce, I'd love the recipe.
