Place the rice in a 9x12" baking pan. Arrainge the chicken parts on
the rice. Pour the Orange Juice over the chicken parts. Smear the
cream of mushroom soup over the chicken. Cover *tightly* with
aluminum foil and bake in a S-L-O-W oven for 2 -3 hours. (200oF in
not too low.) 1 cup of liquid to 1 cup of rice is correct. You will
end up with firm, orange flavored rice that is carmalized to a dark
brown in the corners of the pan. Use any cream soup that you like and
if you have the oven temp. low enough, it can cook 4-5 hours and
still be great.
