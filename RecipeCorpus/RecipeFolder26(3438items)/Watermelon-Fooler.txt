Early in day: Make "bowl" by cutting watermelon in half lengthwise,
with one section (the prettier one from the outside) slightly larger
than the other. Scoop out pink meat from larger half. (Serve pink
meat that day.) Fill "bowl" with raspberry sherbet* till level with
top; smooth surface. For "seeds", tuck in rows of semisweet chocolate
pieces or raisins. Store in freezer short time before serving. To
serve, cut into wedges. Or if you prefer to use it as table
centerpiece, freeze a day or so ahead till extra firm; let guests
spoon out servings for dessert.

*To know how much sherbet you'll need, fill "bowl" with water; then
measure water with quart container.
