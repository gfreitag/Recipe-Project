Lightly flour chops.  Melt butter in nonstick skillet over medium-high
heat until foaming.  Brown chops quickly on both sides.  Remove and
set aside. Add scallions, garlic, mushrooms and thyme and saute an
additional minute. Return chops to skillet, add beer; bring to a
boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer 7-8 minutes.  Season with salt
and pepper.  Serve with cooked noodles.
