electic mixer on medium speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in
eggs, one at a time. Beat in vanilla and 1 cup cream; beat 3 to 4
minutes. Fold in 1-1/2 cups cut-up Snickers pieces. Turn into a

cheesecake.
Refrigerate at least 4 to 5 hours before serving. Run a knife around
edge of pan to loosen cake and remove springform side of pan. Just
before serving, drizzle Yummy Fudge Topping over cake. Whip remaining
1 cup of cream until stiff and spoon a dollop over each slice.
