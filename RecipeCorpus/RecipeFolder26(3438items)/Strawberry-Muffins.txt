Categories: Fatfree, Fruit, Muffin
Yield: 12 servings
Canola oil)
2 c  Strawberries, fresh or
Frozen, preferably
Unsweetened (I used fresh)
3    Egg whites
1 1/2 c  Oatbran
1/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Apple fiber
x  Skim milk, if needed
1 t  Baking soda
2 T  Corn syrup (originally
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper cups or
spray them with Pam. In a large mixing bowl or in the food processor,
combine oat bran, apple fiber, and baking soda. (I just stirred with
a spoon) Stir until thoroughly mixed. Place in a blender or food
processor 1 cup of the strawberries with the sugar and puree until
smooth. Measure the strawberry puree; if it does not measure 1 cup,
add enough skim milk to bring it to that level. Dice remaining
strawberries. In a small mixing bowl combine the strawberry puree and
the corn syrup, and stir this into the dry ingredients to combine
thoroughly.  Stir in the chopped stawberries. Beat egg whites until
stiff and fold them into the batter. Spoon the batter into the
prepared muffin cups and bake for 20 minutes.

NOTES:  The batter looked very dry to me and so did the muffins when
they came out of the oven, they looked funny too.  But I just ate one
and they are delicious and more moist than the muffins I usually make!
