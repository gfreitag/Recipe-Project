Categories: Moroccan, Vegetable, Beef, Soup/stew, Pumpkin
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 lb Bastourma; or Khlii in one
;piece
2 lb Pumpkin; peeled, seeded and
;cubed
3 sm Tomato; peeled, seeded and
;chopped
2 1/2 c  Lentils, dried
2 tb Lard
2    Onion; sliced
2    Hot red chilies, dried; or
;3 small hot green chilies,
;crushed
1 1/2 tb Paprika
Note: "Khlii" is a Moroccan sun-dried beef spiced with coriander,
cumin and garlic.

Melt the fat or lard in a large, heavy-bottomed pot and cook the
onions together with the chilies, paprika and bastourma (or Khlii, if
available) until the onions are wilted.  Add 2 quarts of water and
season the mixture with salt.  Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce
the heat to low.
In another large pot, parboil the lentils for one to two minutes in
boiling water.  Drain them, and pour them immediately into the\e pot
with the meat.  When the lentils are almost cooked--after 15
minutes--add the pumpkin and tomatoes.  Take the stew off the heat as
soon as the pumpkin is cooked--about 20 minutes.  Remove the meat,
slice it thin and put it back into the pot.  Add a little water to
the stew if the sauce is too thick. misc07
