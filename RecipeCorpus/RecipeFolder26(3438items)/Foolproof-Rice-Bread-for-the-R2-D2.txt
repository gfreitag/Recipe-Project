Title: Foolproof Rice Bread for the R2 D2
Categories: Breadmaker, Rice
Yield: 16 servings
1 tb Oil
1 c  Rice; cooked
1 c  Water
1/2 tb Yeast
2 1/4 c  Flour, bread
1 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

For a richer bread, use 1 egg and 3/4 c water instead of 1 c water.

In hot, humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Sylvia's comment: Very soft, nice all-purpose bread. Great for
sandwiches. WARNING: the dough will look a little "wet." DO NOT ADD
EXTRA FLOUR.
