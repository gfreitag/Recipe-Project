This is an experiment of my own that turned out great.  I was waxing
nostalgic over the terrific spiced apple cider a friend used to make
every fall, and decided to see if we could make a bread out of it; I
combined the cider spicing with bread recipe, tweaked a bit and
enjoyed the result. This recipe makes 1 loaf on the Panasonic
machine, modify as needed for your own or hand baking. 2 1/4 cups
white unbleached flour 1 each large finely chopped, skinned, cored,
Tbl  powdered
seeded apple 7/8 cup water 2 Tbl dark brown sugar 1
dry lowfat milk 1 1/2 Tbl butter 1-3 tsp powdered orange peel (gives
"bite", adjust as desired) 1 tsp cinnamon (don't go over 1
tablespoon) 1/4 tsp cloves 1/2 tsp nutmeg large pinch of ginger 1/4
cup finely chopped (or powdered with coffee grinder) sunflower seeds,
pecans or other nuts  [optional] 1 1/2 tsp fresh yeast 1 tsp salt

Put everything but yeast and nuts into bread machine.  Add yeast and
nuts during appropriate cycle.  That's it. Different varieties of
apple will change the taste a great deal.  My personal favorites are
Granny Smith and Golden Delicious.  You can probably substitute
margarine or veg oil for the butter, just adjust the water if using
an oil. Don't substitute apple cider for the apple and water, you do
not get a strong enough apple taste without making the dough too
watery. Shared by: Sharon Allsup
