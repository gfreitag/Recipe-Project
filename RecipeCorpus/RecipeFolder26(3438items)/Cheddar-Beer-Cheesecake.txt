1 c  Sifted flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Grated lemon rind
4 oz (1 stick) butter, softened
1    Egg yolk
1/4 ts Vanilla

CRUST: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. To repare the crust, mix the
flour, sugar and lemon rind. Cream with the butter. Add the egg yolk
and vanilla. Stir till a soft dough is formed. Press 1/3 of the dough
onto the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes
or until lightly browned. Watch carefully, as it burns quickly. Let
cool. Press the remaining dough around the sides of the pan, coming
to within 1 inch of the top.  FILLING:  Beat the cream cheese until
light and fluffy. Beat in the Cheddar cheese until well blended. Add
the sugar, vanilla, and lemon and orange rinds. Beat until smooth.
Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Stir in beer and heavy cream. Pour into the prepared crust.
Return to the 500 degree oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until
lightly browned. Reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees. Bake for
1 to 1-1/2 hours, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out
fairly clean. Cool to room temperature. Serve warm or chilled.
