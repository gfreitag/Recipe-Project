Title: Venison Jerky II From The Montana Cookbook
Categories: Game, Jerky, Meat, Beef, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 T  Prepared mustard
3 lb Lean venison
1 T  Salt
1 t  Garlic powder
1/2 t  Black pepper
Cut venison into 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick strips. Mix all
other ingredients and pour over the meat. Marinate overnight. Remove
from marinade and dry with paper towels. Place in oven. In a gas oven
the pilot flame will dry jerkey in 4 days.  In a 200 degree electric
oven, leave in the oven until dry by feel. (Note By Rich Harper) This
should work if you get the leanest beef possible (Flank Steak for
example). Steve Shanker
