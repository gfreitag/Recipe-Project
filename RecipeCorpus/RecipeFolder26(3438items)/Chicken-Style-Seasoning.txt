Title: Chicken Style Seasoning
Categories: Herbs/spice, Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Celery seed
2 1/2 T  Italian seasoning
2 T  Parsley, dried
1 1/3 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
3 T  Onion powder
2 1/2 t  Garlic powder
1 T  Salt
Blend smooth all ingredients except parsley.  Stir in parsley.  Store
in airtight container.

Notes:

Use this seasoning to make a quick chicken-like stock out of water
when you have no veggie stock on hand.  Excellent for flavoring rice
and as a soup base.

Make a very simple, easy, and good-tasting gravy by mixing water,
seasoning, and miso (I like the dark brown rice miso).  Typical
proportions: 1.5 cups water, 1 T seasoning, 2 t miso.
Increase/decrease seasonings according your your taste.  Right before
serving gravy, mix some starch (I frequently use potato starch) in a
bit of water till well-blended and add to gravy to thicken (do this
over medium heat). Add starch until you reach desired thickness.
Quick, easy, and surprisingly tastey. From _Country Kitchen
