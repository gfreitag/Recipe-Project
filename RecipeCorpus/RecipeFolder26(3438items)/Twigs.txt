Combine milk, eggs, liquor, sugar and salt in a large bowl. MIx well.
Gradually add flour, enough to make a stiff dough. Turn out on a
floured board and knead until smooth. Roll out thinly and cut into
approximately 36 5-by-1-inch strips. Make a lengthwise slit down the
center of each strip, allowing 1 inch on each end uncut. Put one end
of the dough through the slit to form a sort of loop. Deep-fry in hot
fat (375 deg. F. on a frying thermometer), about 10 at a time, until
golden. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain. To serve, sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar and cinnamon. Makes about 3 doz.


NOTES:  These cookies take their name, khvorost, from the Russian
word for
firewood kindling - twigs or branches - which they somewhat
resemble.
