Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 tb Spicy Creole mustard
1 tb Drained capers (optional)
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce
1 c  Mayonnaise
Grated zest of 1 lemon
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Chopped dill pickle
MMMMM----------------------------FISH---------------------------------
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2 lb Catfish filets
Lemon wedges, for garnish
1 c  All-purpose flour
4    Large eggs
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
3 tb OLd Bay Seasoning
1/2 ts Salt
Make the remoulade sauce: In a small bowl, stir together all the
ingredients until well mixed. Cover, and refrigerate for at least one
hour or overnight.

Prepare the catfish: Get everything ready before starting your
fish fry: Place the flour on a plate. Beat the eggs well in a medium
bowl. In a large bowl, whisk the cornmeal, Old Bay Seasoning, salt,
and garlic powder to combine. Heat the oil in a large skillet over
medium heat until very hot but not smoking. Preheat the oven to 200.

The procedure will go smoothest if you reserve one hand for
dredging the catfish in the flour and dipping it in the eggs, and the
other for coating in the seasoned cornmeal. In batches, dredge the
catfish in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the catfish in the
eggs, coating on both sides. Then dredge the dipped catfish in the
seasoned cornmeal, patting the coating so it will adhere. Slip the
coated catfish into the oil, and cook over medium heat, turning once,
until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Using a
slotted spatula, transfer the browned catfish to a paper towel-lined
baking sheet to drain, and keep warm in the oven while continuing
with the remaining catfish.

Serve the catfish as soon as possible, with the remoulade sauce
on the side. Garnish with the lemon wedges.
