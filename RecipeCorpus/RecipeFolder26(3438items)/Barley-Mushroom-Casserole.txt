NOTES : Barley, one of the world's oldest foods and a nutritious grain
with an appealing nutty flavor, is widely used in Poland. The
following barley dish can be served as an accompaniment to
fish,
meat or poultry. It is usually made with flavorful wild
mushrooms,
but cultivated ones are also good.
