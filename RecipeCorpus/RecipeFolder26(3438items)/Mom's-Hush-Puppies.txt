Title: Mom's Hush Puppies
Categories: Bread, Pancakes
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Milk
Oil for frying, 350 deg. F.
1 c  Pancake mix
1 c  Yellow Cornmeal
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
Sift dry ingredients together.  Add milk slowly until "dough" is very
thick, dry and crumbly, or just sticks together well enough to form a
ball when rolled between the hands.

Deep fry at 350 degrees F for 2-3 minutes, until light golden brown.

Drain on paper towels, serve hot.  Great with spaghetti!
