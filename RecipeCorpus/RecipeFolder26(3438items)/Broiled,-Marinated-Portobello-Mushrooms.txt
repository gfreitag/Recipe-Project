Title: Broiled, Marinated Portobello Mushrooms
Categories: Fatfree, Marinade, Mushroom
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
2 T  Lime juice
1/4 c  Soy sauce (?)
x  Chopped scallions
1    Chopped chili pepper
1    Cloves chopped garlic
that's about it. Then I just marinated the mushrooms in the fridge,
just like the m**t, (I did it over night), flipping them every so
often) and broiled. I served it with wildrice with onions. (I am a
very big fan of w.rice!)
