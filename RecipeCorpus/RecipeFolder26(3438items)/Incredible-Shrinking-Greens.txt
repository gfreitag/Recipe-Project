Title: Incredible Shrinking Greens
Categories: Information, Vegetable
Yield: 1 info  Since greens shrink so dramatically when prepared and cooked, it's

difficult to calculate how to substitute frozen spinach for fresh.
Though based on averages, the following tables should help you make
more accurate guesses.
