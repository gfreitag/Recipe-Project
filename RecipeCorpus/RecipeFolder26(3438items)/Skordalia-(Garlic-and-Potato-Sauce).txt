Title: Skordalia (Garlic and Potato Sauce)
Categories: Middle east, Greek, Salsa/sauce, Dip
Yield: 1 cup
12 tb Olive oil
2 tb Lemon juice, fresh
White or black pepper;
;freshly ground
1 lb Potatoes, baking; peeled &
;cut into small pieces
1 tb Garlic; finely chopped
1 ts Salt
1    Egg yolk
Drop the potatoes into enough lightly salted boiling water to cover
them completely and cook briskly until they show no resistance when
pierced with the point of a small, sharp knife.  Drain and return the
potatoes to the pan.  Shake the pan constantly over moderate heat for
a minute or so until the potatoes are completely dry.  Then mash them
to a smooth puree.
With a large mortar and pestle or the back of a spoon, mash the
garlic and salt together to a fine paste.  Add the warm mashed
potatoes a little at a time, stirring and mashing vigorously until
the ingredients are well combined.  Beat in the egg yolk, then the
oil, a tablespoon or so at a time, making sure each addition of oil
is absorbed before adding more. The mixture will absorb from 8 to 12
tablespoons of oil, depending on the texture of the potatoes.
Beat in the lemon juice, taste and add as much pepper and salt as
you think it needs.  the sauce should be highly seasoned and dense
enough to hold its shape almost solidly in a spoon.  If you prefer a
thinner sauce, beat in a little luke warm water a few drops at a
time. Skordalia is traditionally served with fried food or broiled
seafood or with cold sliced beets.

Personal addition:  Although not indicated as use as dip, I have
found with a little more garlic, it makes a great dip for raw
cauliflower, broccoli and carrots, celery seemed too bland for any
contrast in flavor. Submitted By EARL CRAVENS   On   01-14-95
