1 Tablespoon Corn Starch = 2 Tablespoons Flour

Corn starch has twice the thickening power of lour.  When a gravy,
sauce, soup or stew recipe calls for flour, use half as much corn
starch to thicken.

To thicken hot liquids, first mix corn starch with a little cold water
until smooth.  Gradually add to hot liquid until blended.
