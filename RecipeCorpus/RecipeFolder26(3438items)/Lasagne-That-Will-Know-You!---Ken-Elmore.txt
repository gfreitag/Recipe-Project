Title: Lasagne That Will Know You! - Ken Elmore
Categories: Pasta, Ground beef, Sausage, Cheese/eggs, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Oregano
8 oz Lasagne noodles (about)
2 c  Ricotta cheese (1 lb)
8 oz Mozzarella cheese, sliced
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1 md Onion, chopped
3 tb Olive oil
1 lb Ground chuck beef
1/2 lb Italian sausagae
2 cl Garlic, minced
15 oz Tomato sauce
8 oz Tomato paste
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1/2 c  Water
In a wide frying pan over medium high heat, cook onion in oil until
onion is soft; add beef and sausage and garlic and cook, stirring,
until meat is browned and crumbly.  Stir in tomato sauce, tomato
paste, wine, water, salt, oregano, pepper and sugar.  Cover pan and
simmer for about 1 1/2 hours.  Meanwhile, following package
directions, cook lasagne noodles in a large kettle of boiling water
until al dente.  Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.

Butter a 9 by 13 inch baking dish.  Spread a thin layer of sauce over
the bottom.  Arrange 1/3 of the noodles in an even layer over sauce.
Spread 1/3 of the sauce over the noodles; dot with 1/3 of the
ricotta, then cover with 1/3 of the Mozzarella.  Repeat this layering
two more times. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top.  If made
ahead, cover and refrigerate.

Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven until hot and bubbly (40 to 50
minutes).

I would strongly recommend doubleing the sauce and saving what you
don't use.  Also you might want to increase the garlic and oregano
and add some bay leaves.  I personally more than double the whole
recipe and freeze the leftovers.
