1/2 c  Water
2 T  Olive oil
1 T  Prepared pesto
3 1/2 lb Whole chicken
2 ea To 3 ounces fresh mild goat

The night before, remove the gunk from the chicken.  Massage the
chicken thoroughly with the cheese and and pesto, inside and out,
working them as far as possible under the skin.  Insert the basil
leaves under the skin. Place the chicken in a plastic bag and
refrigerate overnight. Prepare the smoker, bringing the temperature
to 200 - 220 F. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it
sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. If you plan to baste
the chicken, mix together the mop ingredients in a saucepan.  Keep
the mop warm over low heat. Transfer the chicken to the smoker,
breast side down.  Cook for 3-1/2 to 4 hours, basting the chicken
with the mop every 30 minutes.  Turn the bird breast side up about
halfway through cooking time.  When the chicken is done, its legs
will move freely and the internal temperature should be 180 to 185 F.
Let the chicken sit for 5 to 10 minutes. From: Smoke & Spice Shared
