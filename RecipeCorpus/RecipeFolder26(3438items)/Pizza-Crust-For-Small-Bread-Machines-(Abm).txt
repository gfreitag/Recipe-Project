Title: Pizza Crust For Small Bread Machines (Abm)
Categories: Fatfree, Breadmaker, Pizza, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Water
1 t  Yeast
2 1/4 c  Bread flour
1 t  Salt
1 1/2 t  Applesauce
after cycle is done, cut into 4 portions; cover with plastic wrap and
let rise for 20 mins. Shape, top, and bake 12-15 mins. in a 500
degree oven.

Note: I haven't tested this one, so let me know if it works.

By the way, I cheated and sprayed the pans a little so the pizza
wouldn't stick. I really need to get more non-stick cookware.
