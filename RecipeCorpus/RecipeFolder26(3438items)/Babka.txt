Sprinkle or crumble yeast into warm water. Use very warm water for dry
yeast and lukewarm water for compressed yeast. After a minute or two,
stir to dissolve. Cream butter in a large bowl. Add sugar. Beat 4 of
the egg yolks with salt; add to butter mixture. Stir in yeast and
lemon and orange rinds; mix well. Add milk and enough flour to make a
soft dough; mix again. Stir in chopped almonds and raisins. Turn out
on a floured board and knead until smooth and elastic. Form into a
ball and place in a greased bowl. Turn over and place in a warm
place, covered with a towel, to rise until doubled in bulk, about 2
hours. Arrange dough in a buttered fluted tube pan or a round pan.
Let rise again, covered, until doubled in bulk. Mix remaining egg
yolk with 2 Tbs water and brush over top. Sprinkle top with almond
slivers, pressing into dough (or omit almonds and spread with
frosting when cooked and cooled). Bake in a preheated moderate oven
(350Â°F.) about 40 mins, or until cooked. Makes about 16 servings.

NOTES : The national cake of Poland is called babka. It is derived
from
the word for "old woman". This flavorful nut and raisin-studded
yeast cake was probably so named because the fluted pan in
which
it is baked resembles the skirt of a woman. The cake, similar
to
the kulich of Russia, is traditional fare for Easter.
