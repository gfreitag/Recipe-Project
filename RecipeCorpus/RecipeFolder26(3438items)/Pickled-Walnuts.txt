No Ingredients Found
I got this recipe probably 25 years ago, but have never made it...
never had a source of green walnuts 8-} This was given to me by an
elderly lady who lived next door to us.  She didn't use any amounts
for ingredients in anything she made.. 8-} She said she had been
given this recipe by her mother and it had been in her family for
ages... walnuts (green) salt water cider vinegar pepper ginger
mustard seed horse radish, optional

Gather walnuts when green.  Wash them off and let stand in brine (1
cup salt to 1 gallon water) for 6 days.  Change brine and let stand an
additional 3 more days.  Drain.  Pour over a pickle of cider vinegar
with a good quantity of pepper, ginger, mustard seed and horse radish
(if using), all boiled together but cold. They will be good in 6
months. Origin: Elderly lady who lived next door (1968) Shared by:
