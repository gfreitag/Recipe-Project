Preheat oven to 350F.  Heat 1-1/2 tablespoons oil in heavy large
skillet over high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper.  Dredge in
1 cup flour; shake off excess.  Working in batches, add pork to
skillet and saute until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Arrange pork
in single layer in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle 1/2
teaspoon paprika over pork. Discard contents of skillet; wipe clean.
Add 1-1/2 tablespoons oil; heat over medium-high heat.   Add onions;
sprinke with sugar and saute until well browned, stirring often,
about 20 minutes.  Add garlic; saute 1 minute.  Add 1/2 tablespoon
paprika.  Place onions over pork. Pour enough broth over so that
chops are almost covered. Cover with foil. Bake until pork is tender,
about 45 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Uncover; cool slightly.
Cover; chill.  Rewarm covered pork in 350F oven, about 20 minutes.)
Reduce oven temperature to 200F. Using tongs, transfer pork to large
bowl, leaving onion mixture in baking dish.  Pour contents of baking
dish into strainer set over medium bowl. Return onion mixture to same
baking dish, spreading evenly (reserve cooking liquid). Arrange pork
atop onions; sprinkle w/cheese.  Cover dish with foil; set in oven to
keep warm. Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add
2-1/2 tablespoons flour.  Cook until mixture just begins to color,
whisking often (mixture will be dry and crumbly), about 4 minutes.
Gradually whisk in reserved cooking liquid.  Bring sauce to boil,
whisking constantly. Boil until thickened, whisking often, about 5
minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer pork and onions to
plates. Spoon sauce around pork and serve.

Serves 4.  Serve with noodles and sauteed carrots.
