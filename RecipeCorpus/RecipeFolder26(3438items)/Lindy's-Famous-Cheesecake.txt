Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM--------------------------*CRUST*-------------------------------
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 ea Egg yolk
1/4 c  Butter, softened
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Lemon peel, grated
MMMMM-------------------------*FILLING*------------------------------
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
5 ea Eggs
2 ea Egg yolks
1/4 c  Heavy cream
40 oz Cream Cheese
1 3/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Flour
1 1/2 ts Lemon peel, grated
1 1/2 ts Orange peel, grated
*CRUST*

Combine the flour, sugar, lemon peel and vanilla in a medium bowl.
Make a well in the center.  Add the egg yolk and butter.  Use your
finger tips to mix until a dough forms and cleans the sides of the
bowl. Form the dough into a ball.  Wrap in waxed paper. Refrigerate
for 1 hour or more.

Preheat oven to 400 degF.

Grease the sides and bottom of a 9" springform pan. Roll 1/3 of the
dough on the bottom of the springform pan. Trim the edge of the dough
to fit the pan. Bake until golden (8-10 minutes). Divide the rest of
the dough into 3 parts. Roll each part into a strip 2 1/2" wide and
about 10" long. Put the springform pan together with the baked crust
on the bottom. Fit the 3 dough strips to the side of the pan, joining
the ends inside to completely line the inside of the pan. Trim the
dough so that it only comes 3/4 of the way up the side of the pan.
Refrigerate the dough lined pan until you are ready to fill it.

Increase the oven temperture to 500 degF.

*FILLING*

Use the large bowl of an electric mixer to combine the cheese, sugar,
flour, lemon and orange peels and vanilla extract. Beat at high speed
just until blended. Beat the eggs and egg yolks in one at a time. Add
the cream. Beat until just well combined. Pour the mixture into the
springform pan.

Bake 10 minutes at 500 degF.

Reduce oven temperture to 250 degF.

Bake 1 hour longer.

Cool in the pan on a wire rack. Refrigerate at least 3 hours. Loosen
the pastry from the side of the pan with a spatula. Remove the side
of the springform pan. Cut into wedges. Serve.
