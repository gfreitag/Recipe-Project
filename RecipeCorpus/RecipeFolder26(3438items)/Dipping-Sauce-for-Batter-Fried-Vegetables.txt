Categories: Appetizer, Salsa/sauce, Dip
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 ts Gingeroot, grated
1 c  Water
1/4 c  Dry sherrry
Combine water, sherry, soy sauce and gingerroot in saucepan.  Bring
just to boiling.  Remove from heat, keep warm.  Makes 1 1/2 cups.

(I also add some garlic, scallions, and/or chili paste, as taste
dictates) This is also great sauce with tofu and/or fresh veggies.
