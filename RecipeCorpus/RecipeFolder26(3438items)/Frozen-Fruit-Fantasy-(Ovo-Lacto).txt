Vary the fruit juice and fruit puree combinations to develop your own
creative desserts according to the seasons. It takes almost two cups
of fruit to make one cup of puree. Bananas can be mashed with a fork;
other fruits do better in a blender or a Soften gelatin in cold water
for 2-3 minutes.  Combine gelatin, lemon juice, fruit puree, grated
rind or seasoning, fruit juice concentrate and yogurt and mix
thoroughly. Freeze until crystals begin to form around the edges.
Beat egg whites until stiff. Break up the yogurt mix with a spoon and
beat with an electric mixer until smooth.  Fold in beaten egg whites.
Freeze until firm. About 30 minutes before serving, remove from
freezer to refrigerator to allow dessert to soften. Scoop into
stemmed dessert dishes for a festive presentation. Note: If desired,
use 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, cinnamon or cardamom in place of
lemon or orange rind. Honey may be used in place of the juice
concentrate. Nutrition (per serving): 93 calories Total Fat 2 g (16%
