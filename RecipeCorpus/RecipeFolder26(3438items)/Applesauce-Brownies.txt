Recipe by: From The Farmers' Market - ISBN 0-06-055005-8 1. Preheat
oven to 350Â°F. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan; set aside. Melt
the chocolate and butter in a double boiler over hot water, stirring
until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly. 2.
Resift the flour with the baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set
aside. 3. In an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugar at medium
speed until light and foamy, about 5 mins. Lower the mixer speed and
add the applesauce, vanilla, and the chocolate mixture, mixing only
until partially blended. Use a large rubber spatula to fold in the
flour gently; quickly fold in the nuts just until the mixture is
blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it to the
edges of the pan. 4. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of
the brownies emerges just clean, about 35 mins ( do not overbake).
Cool on a wire rack. 5. COCOA GLAZE: Combine the sugar, cocoa,
butter, and milk in a saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until
blended. Bring to a boil; boil 1 min. Remove from heat and transfer
to an electric mixer bowl. Beat the frosting until cool and thick;
then spread on the cool brownies. Cut into squares and serve directly
from the pan with a tall glass of milk.
