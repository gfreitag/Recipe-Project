Title: Mayonnaise Welfare Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Mayonnaise
1 1/2 t  Baking soda
1 t  Vanilla
2 c  Flour
1 1/2 t  Baking powder
1 c  Cold water
4 T  Cocoa
Mix the mayonnaise, sugar and vanilla together.  Blend in the dry
ingredients and turn into a greased 8x8 pan.  Bake at 350F for one

a fixed income.  It is passable. Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by:
