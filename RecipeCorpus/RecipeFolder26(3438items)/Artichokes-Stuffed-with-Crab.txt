Title: Artichokes Stuffed with Crab
Categories: Crab/shrimp, Vegetable, Appetizer
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Sour cream
1/2 x  Lemon-juice
1/2 ts Finely chopped fresh dill
1 pn Cayenne pepper
Salt to taste
2 lg Globe artichokes
Lemon
Bay leaf
1/2 ts Sea salt
1 sm Can crab meat, drained
Wash the artichokes.  Cut the stems horizontally near the bases so
that the artichokes will stand up. Remove the tough outer layer
leaves. With a knife, cut off the tops of the artichokes and snip off
the ends of the sharp leaves. Set the artichokes upright in a pot
with enough water to just cover them. Squeeze the juice from the
lemon over the artichokes and drop the squeezed lemon into the water.
Add the bay leaf and sea salt. Bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat
for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a lower leaf can be pulled off easily
and the meat on the base of the leaf is tender. Remove the artichoke
from the boiling water and drain upside down. Carefully part the
leaves of the artichokes and remove the center or hairy choke with a
spoon, leaving the outside leaves intact. Combine the crab meat, sour
cream, lemon juice and seasonings. Stuff the centers of the warm
artichokes with the cold crab mixture and serve immediately. Use the
artichoke leavess as spoons to scoop out the crab meat. Don't forget
to eat the tender flesh at the base of the leaf as well as the heart
at the base of the artichoke.
