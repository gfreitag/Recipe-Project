A very easy & tasty vegetarian burger taken from Vegetarian Times Mag
Aug 93 issue with a few of my own additions. Cook rice till cooked
and slightly sticky(white rice, I use basmati will take approx 20 min
), & lentils till soft. Cool slightly. Finely mince a medium sweet
potato which has been peeled and cook until soft. Cool slightly.
Finely chop the mushrooms. Spinach leaves should be rinsed and finely
shredded. Mix all ingredients and spices together adding salt &
pepper to taste.(Nutrition values will not reflect added salt
content). Chill in the refrigerator 15-30 min. Form into patties and
saute in pan or can be done on a vegetable grill on an outdoor grill.
Make sure to grease or spray pan with Pam as these burgers will tend
to stick. Note: any added oil or fat will not show up in the
nutrition values so you must add any additional. Nutrition (per
