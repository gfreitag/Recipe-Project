Title: Breakfast Burros
Categories: Breakfast, Tex/mexican, Cheese/eggs, Pork
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 pk Bacon cooked crisp and
-cooled
1 c  Small cubed velvetta cheese
1/2 c  Diced bell pepper
1 pk Large flour tortillas 10
8    Eggs
1/2 lg Size package frozen hash
-browns cube type
In a large skillet fry up the bacon strips and set them aside on a
paper towel when finished. Use the bacon grease and fry the hash
browns until brown (DONE) now add the eggs and stir like you would to
scramble them into the hash browns. When eggs are done remove skillet
from heat and add the bell pepper. Break up the bacon strips into
small bits and add them to the eggs and hashbrown mixture stir in
well salt,pepper to taste. Now warm

your tortillas per package directions and spread the mixture on
tortillas along with a few cubes of cheese, roll up like a bean burro
and then wrap with plastic wrap. Place in the freezer and any time
you want something quick for breakfast just get one out and pop it in
the microwave until hot! These are great for eating on the run and
you only make a big mess once. Remember you can use sausage for this
and measurements are no big deal you just want a even amount of
everything. They last along time in the freezer but if you have kids
dont expect them to be there very long.
