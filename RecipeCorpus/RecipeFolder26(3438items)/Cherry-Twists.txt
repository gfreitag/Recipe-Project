Title: Cherry Twists
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 12 crepes
1 tb Water
Confectioner's sugar, sifted
12    Basic crepes, cooked
20    Oz can cherry pie filling
1    Egg, slightly beaten
Notes: You may use Apple, Berry or other fruit pie filling in place
of the cherry filling. You may use a healthy dollop of whipped cream
as a topping or in place of the powdered sugar. You should sprinkle a
dusting of cinnamon over the whipped cream. You may also use a wedge
shaped portion of flour tortilla in place of the basic crepes.

Preheat the deep fryer. Mix the beaten egg and water together. Place
1 T of fruit filling on the lower 1/3 of each crepe. Brush the top
and bottom edges of the crepes with the egg and water mixture. Fold
the left and right sides of the crepe over the filling. Roll the
crepe up. Place each crepe in the deep fryer, seam side down. Fry
until crisp and golden (about 1 minute). Drain, and sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar. Spoon a little extra filling over the top.
