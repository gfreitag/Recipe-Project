Categories: Middle east, Arab states, Soup/stew, Lamb, Tomato
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg; fresh ground
;preferred
2 ts Salt
Black pepper; freshly ground
1/2 c  Long grain rice, raw; or
;medium grain rice
4    Lamb shanks; lean & meaty,
;each about 3/4 pound
2 qt Water
12 md Tomato; fresh, ripe, peeled,
;seeded and coarsely chopped
;or 4 cups chopped, drained
;canned tomatoes
In a heavy 8 to 10 quart pot, blanch the lamb shanks by covering
them with cold water, bringing it to a boil over high heat and
boiling briskly for 1 minute.  Drain the lamb at once and, under cold
running water, wash away any accumulated scum.  Wash the pot, return
the lamb to it, and add 2 quarts of fresh cold water.  The water
should cover the meat by at least 2 inches; if necessary, add more.
Bring to a boil over high heat, meanwhile skimming off any foam and
scum as they rise to the surface. Reduce the heat to low, partially
cover the pot and simmer for 1 hour.
Stir in the tomatoes, onions, nutmeg, salt and a few grindings of
pepper, partially cover the pot again and simmer for 30 minutes
longer. Then add the rice and cook tightly covered for 20 minutes, or
until the lamb and rice are tender.  Taste for seasoning, and serve
at once from large heated soup plates.
