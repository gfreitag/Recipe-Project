Cover beans with water; bring to a boil. Boil for 2 mins. Remove from
heat. Let stand, covered, for 1 hour. Drain. Put beans with 6 cups
fresh water, carrot parsley and salt in a large kettle. Bring to a
boil. Lower heat; simmer, covered, until beans are cooked, about 2
hours. Saute onion in butter. Stir in flour to blend well. Pour in 1
cup of hot bean broth; mix well. Return to soup. Cook 1 or 2 mins,
stirring. Stir in sour cream. Add Pinched Noodles; cook until they
rise to the surface. Spoon into soup plates. Garnish with chopped
dill. Serves 8.

PINCHED NOODLES:

Sift flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in center and break egg
into it. Add a little water, enough to make a soft dough. Mix well.
Knead to make smooth. Roll out to 1/8-inch thickness. Pinch off
little pieces of dough with fingers and add to soup. Cook until
noodles rise to surface.

NOTES : This Hungarian soup, called Bableves Csipetkevel, is a
favorite
everyday dish for family meals.
