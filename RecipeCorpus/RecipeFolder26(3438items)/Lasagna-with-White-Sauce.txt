"I'm an old-fashioned country cook and love preparing recipes like
this one that uses stapels I normally keep on hand. Unlike most
lasagnas, this one doesn't call for precooking the noodles. It's so
simple my children sometimes make it after school and have it ready
when I get home from work." - Angie Price 1 lb. ground beef 1 lg.
