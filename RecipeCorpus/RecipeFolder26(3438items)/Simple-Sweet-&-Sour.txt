Title: Simple Sweet & Sour
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1/2    Red onion
2    Cloves garlic
1 c  Chopped up carrots
1/2    Yellow bell pepper
1    Yellow zucchini
3 c  Chopped up mushrooms
1    Handful snow peas
1 T  Corn starch
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1/2 t  Freshly minced ginger
1 T  Soy Sauce
1/4 c  Vinegar (I used Rice
Vinegar)
1/4 c  Vegetable broth
Mix together the soy sauce, vinegar and vegetable broth.  Separately,
mix together the corn starch and the brown sugar.  Add the corn
starch, brown sugar mixture to the liquids.  Add in the minced
ginger. Set this mixture aside.  Saute the vegetables in some
additional broth. Just before the vegetables are cooked, add in the
liquid mixture that was set aside, and saute for an additional two
minutes.

I served this over brown rice.  It looked as good as it tasted.
