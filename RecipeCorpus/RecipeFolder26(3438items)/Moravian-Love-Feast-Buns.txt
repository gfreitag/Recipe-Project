the potato, cut in chunks, and cook in boiling water until tender.
Drain, saving 1/2 cup of the potato water. Mash potatoes until smooth
and measure out 1/2 cup of them. Sprinkle yeast over warm water to
dissolve. Combine mashed potato, 1/2 cup of the reserved potato
water, butter, sugar, salt, and eggs. When mixture is lukewarm, stir
in yeast. Cover with a tea towel and set bowl in a warm place until
mixture is spongy-looking. Then mix in the flour thoroughly. (At this
point you should have a soft dough --- add more flour, if needed.)
Cover and let rise until double in size. Punch dough down and knead
on a floured board until smooth. Pinch off pieces of the dough and
shape into buns about 3 inches in diameter. Place on a greased cookie
sheet and let rise a third time until almost double in size. Bake in
a preheated 375Â°F oven for 25 to 30 mins. When buns begin to turn
golden brown, brush tops with cream or melted butter. Cool before
serving. Makes 12.
