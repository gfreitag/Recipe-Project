The large Mexican squid were introduced into America in 1975. A
temperature inversion off San Diego allowed waters from Mexico to
drift north bringing with them Grande Calamari. They began turning up
in the nets of America fisherman who were unfamiliar with the
Monterey squid's larger cousin. As they have often done when the
catch an unusual species, the area's fisherman brought their catch
to, Tod Ghio of Anthony's Fish Grotto. Tod is a restaurateur and fish
market operator know for his willingness to experiment with unusual
varieties of seafood. He took some of the squid to his restaurant,
cooked it and served the steaks to some of his patrons. It was, so
they tell me, "tough as hell". But Tod didn't give up. He cut away 4
layers of skin and uncovered a fillet which, with a little tenderizing

proved to be delicious. Today Tod's restaurants and many others serve
Grande Calamari fillets. 1 Lb. Grande Calamari fillet 1 Egg 1 t Water
2 C Breadcrumbs, made from french bread 1/2 t Dried parsley 1/2 t
Oregano 1/2 t Thyme 1 T Butter 1 T Olive oil 1 T Vegetable oil Mix
egg and water in a bowl. Combine breadcrumbs and herbs. Dip each
fillet in the egg and then coat with bread crumbs. Fry fillet in a
large, heavy frying pan in oil, olive oil, and butter over medium
heat. When fillets have browned, turn them over and brown the other
side. Serve with lemon-garlic butter. SOURCE:*The International Squid
