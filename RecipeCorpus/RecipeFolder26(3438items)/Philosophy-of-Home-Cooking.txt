Unless you live alone in a cave or hermitage, cooking and eating are
social activities:  even hermit monks have one communal meal a month.
The sharing of food is the basis of social life, and to many people
it is the only kind of social life worth participating in.  No one
who cooks, cooks alone. Even at their most solitary, a cook in the
kitchen is surrounded by generations of cooks past, the advice and
menus of cooks present, and the wisdom of cookbook writers.  One of
the delights of life is eating with friends; second to that is
'talking' about eating.  And, for an unsurpassed double whammy, there
is talking about eating WHILE you are eating with friends. People who
like to cook like to talk about food.  Plain old cooks (as opposed to
the geniuses in fancy restaurants) tend to be friendly.  After all,
without one cook giving another cook a tip or two, human life might
have died out a long time ago. Origin: Home Cooking Book, by Laurie
Colwin. Shared by: Sharon Stevens, Dec/94.
