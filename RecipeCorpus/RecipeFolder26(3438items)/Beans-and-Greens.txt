"The soothing creaminess of beans is complemented by the bracing
sharpness of the greens in this time-honored classic from southern
Italy." Use a potato masher or a large slotted spoon to slightly mash
the beans until they hold together.  Stir in the lemon juice, salt
and pepper to taste. If you plan to serve the dish at room
temperature, set it aside. If you plan to serve it hot, gently heat
the beans in a covered saucepan on low heat, using a heat diffuser or
a double boiler, if necessary, to prevent sticking. Wash the greens
and chop them into small pieces. Heat the olive oil and garlic in a
large skillet or wok over medium heat until the garlic just turns
golden.  Add the greens.  You may have to wait for the first greens
in the pan to wilt before adding the rest.  Raise the heat and cook,
stirring frequently, until all of the greens are wilted and bright
green. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the beans and
greens side by side in a serving bowl, or make a nest of greens and
mound the beans in the center.  Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over
the top, if desired. Makes 4 to 6 servings. Per 8-ounce serving: 109
