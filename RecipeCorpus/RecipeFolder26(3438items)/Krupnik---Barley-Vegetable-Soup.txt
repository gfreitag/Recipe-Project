Soak mushrooms in lukewarm water to cover for 20 mins. Drain and
slice, reserving liquid. Put soup bone and 8 cups of water in kettle.
Bring to a boil and skim well. Add carrot, onion, peppercorns and
salt; lower heat. Cook slowly, covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile,
put barley and water to cover in a saucepan and cook slowly, covered,
until barley is cooked, 1 hour or longer. Stir in butter. When soup
has cooked the designated time, remove from heat and take out soup
bone  and meat. Cut meat from bone. Discard any gristle and dice
meat. Return to kettle. Add sliced mushrooms, reserved liquid, and
potatoes and put kettle back on stove. Continue cooking slowly,
covered, until tender, about 25 mins. Stir in cooked barley. Add sour
cream and dill; mix well. Serves 6 to 8.




NOTES : A characteristic Polish soup called krupnik is made with
various
ingredients but always includes barley and, usually, dried
mushrooms, potatoes and other vegetables. Krupnik has an
interesting flavor and is very nutritious.
