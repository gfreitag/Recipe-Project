Grease a muffin tin very thoroughly. Sift the flour and salt
together. Separate eggs and beat the yolks in a small bowl until very
thick and creamy. Whip cream until it holds a shape when you lift the
beater. Now add the flour and whipped cream to the egg yolks
alternately, beginning and ending with flour. Finally, whip the egg
whites until the stand in peaks. Dump batter on top of whites and mix
with your hands until all white patches have disappeared. Work
quickly. Spoon into muffin tin, filling half-full. Bake in a
preheated 375Â°F oven for 20 to 25 mins. You can prepare the mixture,
except for the egg whites, ahead of time. Serve hot with sweet
butter. Makes 12.
