4 ea Egg yolks
1/2 cup
1/2 c  Pistachio
cherries
1 1/2 c  Light cream  1/2 cup rum

Heat light cream in a saucepan or top of double boiler until a film
wrinkles over the surface. Don't boil. Then stir in sugar and salt
until dissolved. Beat egg yolks slightly, stir a little of the hot
cream into them gradually, then mix slowly into the hot cream (no
curdling this way). Cook over gently boiling water, stirring
constantly, until mixture is smooth and thick as corn syrup. Cool
completely. Beat heavy cream stiff and mix it and the rum gently into
the cold custard. Pour into 2 refrigerator trays, set freezing
control at coldest point and freeze until firm. Chop up cherries and
nuts. Transfer ice cream to a bowl and mix with a spoon or electric
mixer until ice cream is free of chunks. Stir in the cherries and
nuts spoon into a 1 1/2-quart melon mold and freeze until firm in
your freezer. No freezer? Then pack as you would homemade ice cream.
Will serve 8 to 10.
