3 ea - Tbsp sultanas
1/2 ea - cup butter, melted
2 ea - oz flaked almonds
3 ea - cups all-purpose flour

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 ea To 2 - Tbsp flaked almonds
-(or 1 oz poppy seeds)
2 ea - egg whites, beaten
pn Salt
Sift flour and salt into large bowl. In a smaller bowl, put 1/4 of the
sifted flour, 2 Tbsp of sugar, 2 egg yolks, yeast and 1/3 of the warm
milk. Beat well until a smooth batter entirely free of lumps. Cover
bowl with cloth; allow to stand until light and spongy. Meanwhile,
soak peel and sultanas in remaining warm milk. Add butter, almonds
and soaked fruit to sifted flour together with yeast mixture and
enough warm milk to make a manageable dough. Knead well on a floured
board until smooth and elastic. Put dough in large greased plastic
bag covered with cloth. Allow to rise until double in size. Punch
down dough on floured board. Divide into 8 equal pieces. Put 4 pieces
back in plastic bag while you roll the other 4 into long ropes. Braid
these, starting in the middle; damp the ends with water. Pinch
together to prevent them separating. This section forms the base of
the loaf. Place this on a greased baking sheet. Brush with the egg
whites, beaten a little with a pinch of salt. Make another braid with
3 of the remaining pieces of dough. Place this firmly on top of the
base. Brush with egg white mixture. Divide the last piece of dough in
half; roll into 2 thin ropes. Twist these together. Press along top
of last braid. Brush with egg white mixture. If first 2 braids look
at all dry, give them another coat of egg white mixture and sprinkle
loaf with poppy seeds or almonds. Cover with greased wrap. Allow to
stand again until well risen. Bake @ 350 degrees for 40 to 50
minutes, until golden brown. Cool on wire rack before slicing.
