-with
A pocket (2 lbs. total)
4 ea Rib pork chops - cut
-1-1/2-inches thick, each
MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
2 T  Chopped parsley
1 t  Salt
1/2 t  Grated orange peel
1 1/2 t  Seasoned salt
3 T  Orange juice
3 T  Butter - OR margarine
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/4 c  Chopped green onions
1 1/2 c  Soft bread cubes
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1/4 c  Orange marmalade
2 T  Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Light brown sugar
Preheat the oven to 375F.   Wipe pork chops well. Cook the onions,
green onions and celery in hot butter until tender (about 8 minutes).
Add bread cubes and brown slightly.  Remove from heat. Add parsley,
salt, orange peel, 1 teaspoon of the seasoned salt, and orange juice;
toss mixture lightly to combine. Fill the pockets of the chops with
the stuffing. Stand chops on rib bones on a rack in a shallow
roasting pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt. Pour water to
1/2-inch depth in the roasting pan. (The water should not touch the
rack.)  Cover chops and roasting pan with foil.  Bake chops 1-1/2
hours.  [Since we tend to cook pork less these days, I would only
bake 1 hour.] Meanwhile, prepare the glaze. Combine all of the
ingredients in a small saucepan, mixing well. Bring to the boiling
point, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15
minutes. Remove the foil from the chops and pour off the water. Brush
the chops with some of the glaze.  Bake, uncovered, 30 minutes or
until the chops are tender and brown.  Baste with the glaze every 10
minutes.

Makes 4 servings.
