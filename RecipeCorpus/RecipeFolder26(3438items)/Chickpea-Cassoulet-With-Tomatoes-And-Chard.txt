Title: Chickpea Cassoulet With Tomatoes And Chard
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Tomato, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
(optional)
1    15 oz can chickpeas
2 c  Chopped tomatoes
x  Freshly ground pepper
1 bn Chard, leaves only
1    Box 12 oz spaghetti
1/2 c  Grated soy cheese
1    Onion diced
3    Cloves garlic, minced
2 pn Red pepper
2 t  Chopped fresh thyme(1/2 tsp
Dried)
1/2 t  Paprika
x  Pinch saffron threads
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cook pasta al dente, drain.  Saute onion
garlic, crushed red pepper, herbs, paprika, and saffron (if desired).
Cook over medium high heat, stirring frequently until onions are soft
about 8 min. Add chickpeas, 1/2 cup of their liquid and tomatoes.
Season with pepper. Lower heat and simmer 15 min.  If pan becomes
dry, add a little water to keep it moist.  Steam chard until bright
green and tender.  Remove, chop coarsely, season with pepper and if
desired salt.  Put pasta in casserole, add chickpea-tomato mixture,
chard and cheese.  Toss until well mixed. Cover with foil and bake
until warmed through, about 20 min.  Serve with additional grated
cheese if desired.  Makes 4 to 6 servings  (I find it to be more).
Here in Fl. it's hard to find chard, so I usually use fresh or frozen
spinach.  Kale would work just as well.  You can also prepare this
ahead of time, then pop into oven and heat for 20 min.

The nutritional info. below will not be accurate because I eliminated
the oil and real cheese. Per serving: 595 cal; 24g protein; 18g fat;
