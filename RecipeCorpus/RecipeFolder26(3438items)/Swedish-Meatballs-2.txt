"This recipe was given to me by a Swedish friend.  It's obviously a
20th-century version of a 19th-century favorite, since back then they
didn't have bouillon cubes or evaporated milk! I think you'll agree
that these modern day "Kottbullar" are very tasty." - Emily Gould

Combine 2/3 cup evaporated milk, onion, crumbs, allspice, salt and
pepper. Add meat; mix well.  Chill.  Shape into 1" balls. In large
skillet, brown meatballs in butter. Dissolve bouillon cubes in
boiling water; pour over meatballs and bring to a boil over medium
heat.  Cover; simmer for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, blend together cold
water and flour. Remove meatballs from skillet; skim fat from pan
juices and reserve juices. Stir remaining evaporated milk and
flour/water mixture into pan juices in skillet; cook, uncovered, over
low heat, stirring until sauce thickens. Return meatballs to skillet.
Stir in lemon juice.
