Recipe by: From The Farmers' Market - ISBN 0-06-055005-8 1. Place the
sugar and water in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cover and
cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Meanwhile, bring the cream
and the vanilla bean to a boil in a separate pan; remove from heat.
Remove the vanilla bean. With a small knife, scrape the vanilla seeds
from the bean into the cream. Set aside. 2. When the sugar has
dissolved, uncover the pan, raise the heat slightly, and bring the
syrup to a boil. Boil, without stirring, until the syrup turns a
medium amber color. 3. Remove the caramel from the heat. Working
carefully, immediately add the hot cream to the caramel, swirling the
pan to combine (the mixture will sputter violently). Return the pan
to medium heat and boil, uncovered, until the sauce has reached a
light napping consistency (it will coat the back of a spoon evenly).
4. Toss the berries into the sauce, stirring gently to coat. Serve
immediately.

NOTES : A combination of ripe fresh berries, bathed in a warm sauce of
caramel, cream, and vanilla. You can use any combination of
available berries.
