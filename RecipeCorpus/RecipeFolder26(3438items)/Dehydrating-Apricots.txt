When Dried, the apricot become a year rounddelicious fruit,wellworth
what it may cost in money and effort.

TO DRY:  Small pieces dry faster and thefinishedfruit retainsits
color and flavor.  So, cut small.  Halve the halves, and sometimes
even half the quarters. Apricots need to be quite dry to keep.  Dry
until quite hard and completely moisture free.  Store in small
plastic bags inside of larger ones.  Even then it iswelltostore
inside an airtightconainer. TO USE: Soften overnight in water to
cover.  Enjoy as is, or use thesoftened fruit and
liquidtomakeleathers or binder for wafers, etc. APRICOT LEATHER: So
chewy and flavorful with nothing added, the taste is a sweet/tart
combination hard to beat.  If the fruit is ripe and soft the pitted
halves will blend with no added liquid.  The rule of thumb is to
begin with enoughfruit to get the blender action started, then add a
few pices at a time  until blender capacity is reached.  Pour the
puree onto leather trays, or trays that have been covered with
plastic wrap. Smooth until it's about 1/4 inch.  The thicker the
leather, the chewier it will be and the longer the drying time.
VARIATIONS: Honey to sweeten, to taste; combined half and half with
apples (add coriander); add one cup chopped dates to blended
apricots; half and half with raspberries (strain out seeds), add
honey (this will make it a bit sticky, but the taste is well worth
the stickiness. Apricot puree makes a perfect binder for confections.
