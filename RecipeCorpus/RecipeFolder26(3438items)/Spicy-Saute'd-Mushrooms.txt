Title: Spicy Saute'd Mushrooms
Categories: Fatfree, Chilies, Mushroom
Yield: 1 servings
x  Salt (to taste)
1/4 c  Dry sherry
1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
2    Medium onions, chopped
2    Hot peppers (to taste)
Saute the mushrooms in the sherry in a non-stick pan until the
mushrooms start to give up some of their liquid.  Then add the rest
of the stuff and saute until soft and brown.  Serve over your
favourite carbohydrates.

My favourite carbo for this dish is Kraft Dinner made without the
margerine.  Make it as directed on the box, but just skip the
margerine and it works just fine, and weighs in at under 10% calories
from fat. Add a slice of FF processed "cheese" to enhance the
creamy/cheesy taste & texture.
