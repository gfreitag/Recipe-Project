Husked sweet corn can bedried right on the cob.  Remember, they'll be
a bit heavy, so don't overload the trays.  When thoroughly dry, the
kernels come right off in the hands.  Hold an end of the cob in one
hand, then grasp and twist the free end with your other hand.  The
small blackIndian corn is especially adaptable toraw eating.  When
soaked, it is sweet and delicious in salads and soups.  Corn silk is
not only useful as an herb, but when dried and powdered, it can add a
very nice 'corny' flavour to a soup. CORN CHIPS:  (Great with garlic
broth.) 3 cups fresh tomatoes, somewhat chopped 1/4 cup or more
chopped onion 3 cloves garlic, crushed 2 tbsp oil 1 tsp cayenne 1 tsp

dried sweet corn and 1 cup of ground flaxseed (or use and additional
1 cup of ground corn) Mix both mixtures together and spread as thinly
as possible on leather tray or parchment paper. Dry until it can be
peeled of paper, flip over and dry on regular rack. CORNAPPLE CRISPS:
