Title: Toffee Butter Crunch
Categories: Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Pecans;coarsely chopped
3/4 c  Chocolate chips;semisweet
1/2 c  Pecans;finely chopped
1 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Water
1 tb Corn syrup
Butter the sides of a heavy 2 quart saucepan.  In it melt the 1 cup
butter.  Add sugar, water, and corn syrup. Cook over medium heat to
300 degrees, stirring frequently (mixture should boil gently over
entire surface).  Watch carefully after 280 degrees.  Remove from
heat. Quickly stir in the 1/2 cup coarsely chopped nuts. Immediately
turn into a buttered 13x9x2-inch pan.  Wait for 2 to 3 minutes for
toffee surface to firm, then sprinkle with the 1/2 cup finely chopped
nuts. Chill till chocolate is firm, break into pieces. Makes about 1
1/2 pound. Note: We have found that it is good to use a straight
sided heavy bottomed pan with a 1 1/2 to 2 inch wooden spatula with
sharp flat edge and to use a flexible metal pan to pour the mixture
into for easy removal when cooled. Toasted chopped almonds can be
used for pecans. Do not use margarine as a sub. for butter. Stir
constantly after 280 degrees, scraping bottom of the pan.
