Recipe by: From The Farmers' Market - ISBN 0-06-055005-8 1. By Hand:
Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Cut the
butter into the dry ingredients until crumbly, using your fingertips,
a pastry blender, or two knives. Do not overmix. 2. Stir together the
egg yolk and juice or water in a small cup. Sprinkle this liquid over
the flour mixture, tossing with a fork. Add just enough water so that
the dough coheres in a ball; do not make the pastry too wet. Gently
flatten the pastry ball into a patty shape. Dust with flour; wrap in
plastic wrap, and chill at least 1 hour before rolling out. 3. With a
Food Processor: Place the flour sugar, and salt in the processor bowl
and mix with several on/off pulses. Add the butter; pulse on and off
until the mixtire is crumbly; do not overprocess. Stir together the
egg yolk and juice or water in a small cup. Add this mixture, pulsing
the machine on and off just until the dough begins to clump together
(don't let it form a ball); add a few drops of cold water if needed.
Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and gently press it
into a ball. Flatten the ball into a disk, flour lightly, wrap, and
chill at least 1 hour before using. Makes one 9- or 10-inch tart or
pie crust.

NOTES : Crisper and less flaky than the pie crust; perfect for
open-face
tarts. This freezes well, too.
