Title: Holiday Salted Almonds
Categories: Nuts/grains, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Oil
Salt
1 lb Almonds, shelled and
-blanched
Blanch almonds by soaking them in boiling water for a few minutes.
Remove skins and pat dry on paper towels.  Put in a bowl and pour oil
in. Mix to coat.  Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.  Pour onto
jelly-roll baking sheet (sheet with sides) and sprinkle generously
with salt. Place into a pre-heated 425 degree oven.  Roast and watch
closely!!! When nuts are lightly browned, remove from oven (they will
continue to roast even after removing from oven so don't wait until
they are dark or they will be too dark).  Spread on paper towels and
salt again.  Let cool and store in airtight containers to keep fresh.
