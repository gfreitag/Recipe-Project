Categories: Vegetable, Side dish, Holiday, Casserole, Sweetpotato
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Butter
1/2 t  Salt
2 ea Eggs, separated
10 ea Regular size marshmallows
3 md Sweet potatoes or yams
(about 8 oz. each)
1/2 c  Half-and-half
1/4 c  Light brown sugar
Cook sweet potatoes or yams in boiling water until tender, about 40
minutes, and drain.  When the potatoes have cooled slightly, peel
them and return them to the cooking pot.  Beat potatoes until they
are smooth. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a small saucepan, heat
half-and-half, sugar, butter and salt over low heat, stirring, until
butter has melted. Beat egg yolks in a medium-size bowl. Gradually
beat in half-and-half mixture.  Gradually beat egg yolk mixture into
potatoes. Beat egg whites in a grease-free, medium-size bowl with
clean beaters until stiff peaks form when beaters are lifted.  Fold
beaten whites into the potato mixture. Turn into a 1 1/2-quart,
buttered casserole.  (May be refrigerated at this point and baked
later).  Arrange marshmallows on top. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes
(longer if refrigerated before baking), or until marshmallows are
melted and lightly browned and the mixture is heated through. Serves:
