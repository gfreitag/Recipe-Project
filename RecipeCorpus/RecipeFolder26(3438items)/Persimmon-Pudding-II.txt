Title: Persimmon Pudding II
Categories: Dessert, Pudding, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Butter
1 tb Ground cinnamon
1 ts Nutmeg
2 1/2 c  Flour (more or less)
1 1/2 qt Persimmons
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Sugar
1 pt Sweet milk
Wash Persimmons, and mash.  Rub through a sieve.  (Larry  note:  I
recommend  using  a "Foley Foodmill") ADD well beaten eggs, sugar,
sweet milk, and the butter, which  has been cut into small pieces,
and the spices.  Add enough flour to make a stiff batter.  Bake in a
moderately hot oven.

Serve with whipped cream.

This is the  second  of  a  collection  of three Persimmon Pudding
recipes from my Grandmother, Blanche Bohannon Lewin.   Her  recipe
file is in the hand  on  my sister, Jane Mantel who graciously shared
them with the conference  participants  of ILink Cuisine, through
your typist, Larry Bibich.
