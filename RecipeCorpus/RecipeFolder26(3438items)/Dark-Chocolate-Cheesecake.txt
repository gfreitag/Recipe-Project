IS IT CHEESECAKE; OR IS IT FUDGE? 1.  Prepare Vanilla Cookie Crust:
press mixture evenly onto bottom and 2 inches up side of a buttered
9-inch springform pan. 2.
Melt chocolate over hot, not boiling, water; cool. 3. Preheat oven
to very slow (275~). 4.  Beat cream cheese, sugar, eggs and vanilla
in a large bowl with electric mixer until smooth. Stir in cooled
melted chocolate and sour cream until blended.  Pour into prepared
pan. 5. Bake in preheated very slow oven (275~) for 1 hour and 45
minutes. Turn off heat; let cake cool in oven with door ajar.  Remove
from oven to wire rack; cool to room temperature; refrigerate.
Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate curls, if you wish.
