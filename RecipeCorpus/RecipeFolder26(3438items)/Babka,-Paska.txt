Categories: Bread, Holiday, Fruit, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Egg white
3 ea Whole eggs
1 c  Butter or Margarine
1 c  Seedless raisins
g  Lemon Rind
2 ea Cakes of yeast (4 oz.)
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Milk, scalded
8 c  Flour
1 t  Salt
First, make a sponge: Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm milk.
Add 2 tsp. sugar and 2 tbsp. flour and beat together well.  Set
aside, covered, and allow the sponge to rise until doubled in bulk.
Sift the rest of the flour and the salt together.  To scalded and
slightly cooled milk, add margarine or butter and sugar and stir
until melted.  Cool to lukewarm. Beat the three eggs well, and add
the lukewarm milk mixture to them. Put the yeast sponge into a large
bowl. Add the milk mixture to it and mix. Add flour and raisins and
beat together well with a wooden spoon. Turn out onto a floured board
and knead for about 8 minutes.  Put back into bowl, cover, and allow
to rise in a warm, draft free place until doubled in bulk. Punch
dough down: knead lightly again for a few minutes.  Divide into
number of babkas desired, placing enough dough in each greased pan to
fill about halfway.  Cover and allow to rise again until doubled in
bulk. Preheat oven to 350 F.  Brush top of babkas with slightly
beaten egg white. Bake 45 minutes to an hour, until golden brown on
top and a straw or wooden skewer inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool and serve with butter or margarine. Shared By: Pat Stockett
