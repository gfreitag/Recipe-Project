1 cn Ro*Tel Diced Tomatoes
-with Green Chilies
1    Bay Leaf

1 tb Oil (Or Pam Olive Oil Spray)
4    Chicken Thighs, Skinned,

1 c  Salsa, Medium
Put oil in very hot pan, add chicken, onion and garlic. Stirfry
rapidly till chicken is lightly browned & sealed on all sides.

Put in large pot with all other ingredients. Add 3 cans of water.
Bring to a boil. Boil, stirring frequently until spinach is
defrosted. Cover, lower to simmer. Simmer at least 1 hour, stirring
occasionally to keep it from sticking to the bottom. The longer it
cooks, the thicker it gets. you may want to add water periodically.
If so, bring back to a boil, then lower to simmer each time.

Makes a thick soup, almost a stew consistency. It is slightly spicy.
If you want it spicier, use hotter salsa, more chili powder, more
cayenne, and/or more, jalapeno sauce.

Serve with a spoonful of fat-free sour cream and some chopped green
onion on the soup. Looks pretty. Stir it in tastes heavenly!
