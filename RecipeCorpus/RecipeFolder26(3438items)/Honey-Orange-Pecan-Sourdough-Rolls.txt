Title: Honey-Orange Pecan Sourdough Rolls
Categories: Bread, Sourdough, Breakfast
Yield: 15 slices
1/4 c  Butter; melted
1/4 c  Honey
1/2 ts Salt
3 1/4 c  Flour; approx.
1/2 c  Starter
1 pk Yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Milk
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Pecans
1 ts Orange extract
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Orange peel; grated
1/4 c  Honey
Soften yeast in water; stir in milk, batter, butter, honey, and salt.
Gradually mix in 3 c of the flour; dough will be sticky.  Turn dough
into a greased bowl, turn over to grease top; cover, and let rise in
a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth,
about 5 min.; add flour if necessary to prevent dough from sticking.
Roll dough out into a 12x15 inch rectangle;  spread orange-nut
filling evenly over dough.  Starting with the long side, roll up
jelly-roll fashion.  Cut across roll into 15 slices about 1 inch each
and arrange, cut-side-up in a well greased 9 by 13 inch baking pan.
Cover and let rise until almost double, about 45 minutes.

Bake in a 350^ oven for 35 minutes or until browned on top. Transfer
rolls to a serving board; quickly scrape out any syrup in pan and
spread it over rolls.  Serve them warm or reheated in a 350^ oven,
lightly covered with foil, for about 20 minutes.  Makes 15 rolls.

Note:  I would like to try this with cinnamon instead of the orange
flavoring.
