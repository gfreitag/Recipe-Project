Categories: Candy, Dessert, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Toasted and skinned hazelnut
-chopped
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
-(about 6 ounces)
-Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
1 1/4 c  (2-1/2 sticks) unsalted butt
1 1/4 c  Packed light-brown sugar
1/4 c  Water
1 tb Honey
Butter a small baking sheet. Melt the butter over low heat in a large
heavy saucepan. Add the sugar, water, and honey and stir constantly
until melted, using a wooden spoon. Increase the heat to moderately
high and continue cooking for 15 minutes, or till the mixture reaches
290 degrees (hard-ball stage) on a candy thermometer, stirring often
with a wooden spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan to make sure
the mixture is not sticking. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in
the chopped nuts and vanilla extract. Pour the toffee evenly onto the
prepared baking sheet. Cool about 5 minutes, until the surface is
barely set. Sprinkle the top of the toffee with the chocolate chips.
Let stand about 10 minutes, until the toffee is completely set and
the chocolate is melted. Spread the chocolate evenly in a thin layer
over the toffee. Cool completely until the chocolate is firm. Break
the toffee into rough pieces and store in an airtight container for
up to 5 days.  Makes about 1 pound. Source: "An Edible Christmas"
