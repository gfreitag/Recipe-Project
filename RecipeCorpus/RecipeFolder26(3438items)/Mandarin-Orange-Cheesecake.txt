TO ASSEMBLE ~~~~~~~~~~~ Drain the mandarin orange segments
thoroughly. In a mixer bowl, combine the cream cheese, ricotta,
sugar, egg yolks, grated orange peel, and vanilla. Add the oranges.

Follow the folding instructions for the shape you have chosen. Bake
in a preheated 350 oven until golden brown, about 50 minutes.

While the cheesecake is baking, prepare the syrup topping. In a
saucepan, combine the sugar and water, bring to a boil, and then
lower the heat and simmer about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and,
when cool, add the orange blossom water.

When the cheesecake comes out of the oven, cut it into square- or
diamond-shaped pieces. Spoon the cooled syrup evenly over the top.
Return it to the oven for about 4 minutes. Then, let the cheesecake
cool about 2 hours before serving.
