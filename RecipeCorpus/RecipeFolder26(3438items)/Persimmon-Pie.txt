3 ea Eggs
1 c  Evaporated milk
1    Unbaked 9-inch pie crust

1/3 c  Honey
1 tb Sorghum
Brush crust with egg white from one of the eggs; set aside.  Mix
persimmon with flour, honey, sorghum and spices.  Beat in eggs and
milk. Pour into prepared pie crust.  Bake at 400F 40-50 minutes until
pie doesn't jiggle when shaken.  Cover edges with circle of foil if

Native persimmons are so sweet that they have also been called wild
figs or sugar plums.  The English word persimmon is said to have come
from the Algonquin word pessemin.  Like apricots, persimmons contain
ample amounts of vitamins A and C.  The easiest way to get persimmon
pulp is to puree fully ripe persimmons using a food mill or a
Chinaman sieve. Aluminum or plastic sieves are best since iron or tin
will turn the rosey orange pulp dark.  Freeze any you don't use now
for use later in winter and spring. When ripe, persimmons are very
soft and take on a dusty pale lavendar cast. Persimmon pulp can be
used in any pumpkin recipe with similar results. It marries well with
cinnamon, nutmeg and orange. Since it is not as think as pumpkin,
adding a little flour to pie fillings is a good idea.
