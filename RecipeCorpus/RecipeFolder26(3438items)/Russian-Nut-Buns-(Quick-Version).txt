filling. Roll up, starting with 20-inch side. Cut into 18 slices.

warm place until about doubled. Bake at 375-F for 20 to 25 minutes or
until brown. Turn onto another baking sheet, then turn topside up on

single loaf, shape the dough into a 9 by 12 inch rectangle, spread
sith filling, roll up, and place in 5 by 9 inch loaf pan. Let rise.
Bake at 350-F for 45 minutes or until browned. Turn out of pan and
