Add the fillet pieces to the remaining soy mixture and turn to coat.
Let stand 5 to 15 minutes. Preheat the broiler.

Put the fish and pineapple on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray
or lightly oiled. Broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat until the fish is
just opaque through the thickest part, 6 to 10 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the fish. Turn the pineapple spears about halfway
through cooking. Fish that is more than 1 inch thick should also be
turned. Serve the fish fillets with a pineapple wedge alongside.
