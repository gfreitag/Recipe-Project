A Polish way of serving fresh vegetables in season is with a butter
and bread crumb topping, known around the world as a la Polonaise.
Sometimes other ingredients such as chopped chives, herbs, or
hard-cooked eggs are added to the basic mixture. This is a good way
of preparing asparagus, Brussels sprouts, cabbage or cauliflower.
Cook vegetables until just tender. Drain. Season with salt and
pepper. Melt 3 Tbs butter in a small saucepan. Stir in 3 Tbs of fine
dry bread crumbs. Pour over the warm vegetables and serve at once.
