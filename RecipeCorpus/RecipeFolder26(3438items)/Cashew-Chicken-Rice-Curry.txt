1/8 t  Dry ginger
1/2 t  Dried mint
1/4 t  Cayenne (more or less)
1/8 t  Mace or nutmeg
Pre-mix and pack in plastic

1/2 c  Raisins or dried fruit
1/2 c  Shredded coconut
Commercial curry powder can be used, but fresh is superior.

Briefly saute the onion in the oil and add the curry. Stir to soak up
the oil, then add the rice. Continue to stir for another minute or
two. The rice should warm up and get coated with the curry mixture
(and smell great!). Add the water and bullion powder and vegetables.
If adding the dried vegetables, increase water by 1/2 c. Stir several
time to prevent the bottom from burning. Simmer for 20 minutes or
until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. A few minutes
before the rice is done, mix in the cashews. Serve with coconut and
raisins on the side.

The whole thing fits in a quart size plastic wrap bag. The chicken
bullion may be omitted to make the dish vegan. Brown rice is OK but
takes longer to cook, and  more water. Small amounts of dry stuff go
neatly in a 'pharmacy' wrap of plastic wrap or waxed paper: put
powder in middle, put sides together and fold twice, fold in ends
away from folded side and rubber band or tie. Camp stoves/fires are
notoriously hot or uneven, so getting a good simmer may be difficult,
especially in wind. Adjust cooking time and water as necessary.
