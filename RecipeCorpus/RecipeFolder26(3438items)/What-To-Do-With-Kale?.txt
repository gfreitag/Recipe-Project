Title: What To Do With Kale?
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Kale
4    Garlic cloves
1    Onion
4 c  Cooked white beans
Lemon juice to taste
Salt, pepper, red pepper
Flakes to taste.
Mix beans, lemon juice, salt and peppers together. Heat gently and
mash slightly.

Chop onions and garlic.  Saute until garlic golden. Slice the greens
into shreds and add to garlic onion mix. Saute until greens wilted.

Suggested serving mound beans on top of greens.

I like to mix them together top with a little parmesan cheese and eat
with big hunks of crusty bread.
