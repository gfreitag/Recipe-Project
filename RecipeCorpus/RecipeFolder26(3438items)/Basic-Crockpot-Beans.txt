Title: Basic Crockpot Beans
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Crockpot
Yield: 1 servings
Or over night
1    2 bay leaves
Water to cover.
2    Onions, chopped
2    3 cloves garlic
1 lb Dried beans, soaked 4 hours
Put in crockpot and cook about 4-6 hours on high or overnight on low.
Beans should be soft (small white beans take longest, pinto beans
shorter)

Add spices, veggies, etc. (see below) cook about another hour.

Spices:, veggies, etc:

1) 1 tsp dried cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1-2
Tbsp. soy sauce,   a few chili peppers, chopped, chopped green
pepper, can chopped tomotoes, some frozen corn. (Good with black
beans) 1/2 tsp liquid smoke tastes good added.

2) 1 tsp cumin, 1 can chopped green chilis, chopped green pepper, 1
Tbsp soy sauce (good with white beans).

3) 1-2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/4 cup molasses, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp
dried mustard, (good with pinto or black eyed peas)

Garbanzo beans I usually use as a substiute in chicken recipes, so
I'll freeze them with just the onions and garlic.  Frozen black eyed
peas are also a good staple to have on hand (for some reason that's
the only legume that comes frozen except for lima beans which I don't
like).
