Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Baking powder
1 t  Cinnamon
1 t  Ginger
1/4 t  Salt
1/8 c  Frozen apple juice
Concentrate
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg white

Cream apple juice concentrate, sugar and egg. Add dry ingredients,
mix, and put into a 9" round non-stick baking dish. (If the mixture
is not smooth like cake batter, add up to 1/8 cup water.)

Bake 15-20 minutes at 350.

When baked and almost cool, slice in half and fill with softened apple
chunks (microwave apple pieces until there is some sauce and then
use).

Mix 1/2 cup icing sugar with enough milk to make icing. Add 3 drops
of red food colouring. Ice the cake.

Recipe can be doubled.
