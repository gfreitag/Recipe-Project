Title: Salat Pilchei Avocado Gezer Bemitz Tapuzim (see dirs.)
Categories: Middle east, Israel, Salad, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Carrots; coarsely grated
1 lg Avocado; ripe, chilled
3 tb Lemon juice, fresh
2 tb Raisins, seedless
1/4 c  Water, warm
1 c  Orange juice, fresh
1/8 ts Red pepper; crushed
1/8 ts Ginger root; grated fresh
Name;  Avocado, Carrot and Orange Salad

Place the raisins in a small bowl, cover with the 1/4 cup of warm
water and soak for 20 minutes.  Drain.
Meanwhile, combine the orange juice, red pepper, grated ginger root
and salt in a deep bowl, add the carrots and turn them about with a
spoon to moisten them thoroughly.  Refrigerate for at least one hour.
Just before serving, cut the avocado in half.  With the tip of a
small knife, loosen the seed and lift it out.  Remove any brown
tissue like fibers clinging to the flesh.  Strip off the skin with
your fingers, starting at the narrow stem end.  (Then dark-skinned
variety does not peel easily; use a small, sharp knife to pull the
skin away, if necessary.)
Cut each avocado half lengthwise into 2 sections and place them on
chilled individual serving plates.  Sprinkle them with the lemon
juice, them, with a slotted spoon, mound the carrots in the cavities
of the avocado quarters.  Scatter the raisins on top.  Moisten each
filled avocado with a little of the remaining orange marinade and
serve at once.
