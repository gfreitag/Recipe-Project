No Ingredients Found
Wet a pudding-cloth; place it in a basin or colander, having
previously well washed and picked a pound of rice if your family be
large: half the quantity will be sufficient if small;  place some of
the wetted rice so as to line the cloth in the mould all round,
saving a handful to strew on the top; fill the hollow up with cored
apples, and a bit of lemon peel shred fine, or six cloves;  throw on
the remainder of the rice; tie the bag, not too tight, as the rice
swells much; and boil a full hour, or longer if the pudding be large.
Eaten with sugar, this is an excellent, and very wholesome, dish:
Acid apples are best, and are so softened by the rice as to need very
little sugar to sweeten them. Origin: The Canadian Settler's Guide,
