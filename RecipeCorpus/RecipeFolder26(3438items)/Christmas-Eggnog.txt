Title: Christmas Eggnog
Categories: Holiday, Beverage, Cheese/eggs, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
2/3 c  Rum
7 c  Half 'n Half cream
1 1/8 c  Sugar  (1 cup + 2 Tbls)
Nutmeg to taste....(lots!)
1/2 ea Dozen eggs, separated
2/3 c  Cognac
2/3 c  Bourbon
1/3 c  Peach brandy
Beat the egg yolks until very light.  Pour in the liquor, one type at
a time and beat well.  (add the rum LAST to avoid "curdling" the
eggs). Add cream slowly, while mixing.  Add sugar, mix until
dissolved. sprinkle with nutmeg. Beat egg whites until fluffy, fold
into eggnog. cover and let "age" for 24 hours. These proportions
yield approx 3 1/2 quarts, filling my big pyrex mixing bowl EXACTLY
to the rim. ++> 14 cups or 28 punchcup servings. It;s really
imperative that you let it rest overnite to "smooth out" the flavour.
If refrigerator space is at a premium, you can keep the egg whites
covered, unbeaten, in a separate container and just let the
egg/cream/sugar/liquor mix "mellow", beating and adding the egg
whites before serving. I used 2 punch bowls, one big one held a
double batch, the smaller one held 1 1/2 batches. I used 1/2 gallon
milk cartons to store it in the fridge until party day.... and kept
the punch bowl supply chilled with a giant block of "natural" vanilla
ice cream. Shared by: Rich Harper
