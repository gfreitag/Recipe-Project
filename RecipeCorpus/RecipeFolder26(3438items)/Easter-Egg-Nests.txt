Title: Easter Egg Nests
Categories: Holiday, Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
JELLY BEANS
DARK CHOCOLATE CANDY
CHOW MEIN NOODLES
Melt the chocolate and let it cool slightly. Mix the chow mein
noodles into chocolate carefully so not to break them into smaller
pieces. When the chocolate is cooled sufficiently to handle, mold
this mixture into small bird shaped nests. Before the mixture has
time to harden, place the jelly beans or small candy easter eggs in
the bowl of the nest. They will stay put when mixture cools. Easy and
fun to make.Use your imagination as to items you could place in the
nests.
