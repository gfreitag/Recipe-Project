Slightly adapted from the Vegetarian Times

Bake, boil, microwave, or pressure cook potatoes until tender. Run
under cold water to remove skins.  Chill.

Meanwhile, steam tofu for 10 minutes.  While tofu is cooking, place
rice vinegar (lemon juice), oil (if desired), tamari, mustard, salt
and garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.

Drain tofu, crumble and add to blender or food processor along with
dill. Blend until smooth and creamy.  You may need to add a few
tablespoons of water (up to 1/4 cup) depending on how soft the tofu
is and how well your blender purees.  You will want it a little
"loose" and liquidy, as the potatoes will absorb some of the moisture.

Chop chilled potatoes into 1-inch cubes and place in a large mixing
bowl. Pour tofu mixture on top of potatoes and mix, evenly coating
potatoes. Stir in celery and parsley.  Be careful not to mash
potatoes as you mix. Makes 6 side-dish servings.

Hmmm....I wonder if fresh basil would work in this, instead of dill?
Pesto potato salad?  :-D
