Sprinkle yeast over warm water to dissolve. Scald milk, remove from
heat, and cool. Add 1 tsp of sugar, 3 cups of flour and the yeast,
stir thoroughly. Cover and let stand in a warm place until double in
size. Beat eggs vigorously and combine with butter, sugar, salt, and
remaining flour. When the dough rises, stir in the egg mixture. At
this point, mixture should be stiff enough to roll. Add more flour,
if needed. Cover and let rise in a warm place a second time until
double in size. Punch down with your fist, then roll about 12-inch
thick on a lightly floured board. Cut into 2-inch squares, making a
slit in the middle. Cover and let rise a third time. Fry several at a
time in deep fat preheated to 350Â°F. Drain on paper towels and
sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
