Title: Tex-Mex Frittata
Categories: Main dish, Vegetable, Cheese/eggs, Tex/mexican
Yield: 4 servings
3    Egg whites
2    Tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 tb Chopped jalapeno pepper
1 c  Shredded low-fat Cheddar or
Monterey Jack cheese
2    Potatoes, peeled
4 ts Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Chopped onions
Salt and pepper
3    Eggs
Browned potatoes and onions form a "crust" for the eggs and tomatoes.
You can use any fresh hot pepper or pickled or canned jalapeno.  If
using fresh peppers, wear rubber gloves to seed and chop them.

In saucepan of boiling salter water, cook potatoes for 8 to 10
minutes or until tender.  Drain and refresh under cold running water;
drain and dice. In overproof skillet, heat oil over medium heat; cook
potatoes and onions, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes or
until browned. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Lightly pat
down potato mixture to level. Beat together eggs and egg whites; pour
over potato mixture. Season with pepper to taste.  Cover and cook
over medium-low heat for 6 to 8 minutes or until eggs are set.
Sprinkle with tomatoes and jalapeno pepper; top with cheese and broil
for 2 minutes or until cheese is melted and lightly browned. Cut into
wedges to serve.
