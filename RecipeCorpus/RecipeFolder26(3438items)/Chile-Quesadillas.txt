Title: Chile Quesadillas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Main dish, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM----------------FROM: RANDY NOSEWORTHY, CUIS---------------------
1 ea Package of Jack or Cheddar
-cheese. (try it with jack
-first time!)
8 cn Of Whole Green Chillies
1 ea Ripe avacado
1 ea Package of flour tortillas
-(small sized ones)
Now, take the chilles and split them in half, there should be about
three of them in an 8 oz can. Next you will want to either slice or
grate (perferd) the cheese. Slice the Avacado up in 1/4 ' slices. Now
preheat a skillet to oh, about med heat. (electric stove) Now, just
lay the tortillas on there and then cover one half with some of the
cheese (or cover the whole thing with cheese if you really LOVE
cheese like I do). Then put about a half of a chille on top of the
cheese. (this is sorta like makin' an omlet, and it would be good as
an omlet less tortilla... replaced with eggs). Put enuff avacado
slices on there to cover the chille's and flip half of the torllia
over it's self, to form a half circle. Now just flip it over once or
more to make sure that the chese is melted, and to keep from burning
the tortilla. Once you feel that the cheese is all melted, take the
tortilla and slice it if you want, and toss it at your favorite loved
one, and see if he likes it.. if he does, make some for your self...
<Grin>. This is really an easy thing to make. Try some variations to
this with Ground Beef ect ect.... there's a million things that can
be done with Mexican type foods..... Most are easy, and quick! A
little imagination will go a long way with a pound of beef, Salsa,
and some Taco Shells or Tortillas. BTW The Green Chilles aren't hot
at all, so don't be scared of this  if you might think that it's
gonna burn a HOLE in your tounge! Have fun! Randy
