Here's a different way to have fried chicken. Poaching chicken ahead
in water reduces fat & allows for less frying time later. 2 chickens
(3 lbs. each), cut up 2 bay leaves 2 whole cloves 1 garlic clove,
finely chopped 1 tbsp. celery seed 1 1/2 quarts vegetable oil 2 cups
pancake mix 1 tsp. paprika 1/4 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. freshly ground
pepper 2 eggs, well beaten 1. Place chicken pieces in a large
saucepan or flameproof casserole. Add 2 cups water, bay leaves,
cloves, garlic & celery seed. Cover & bring to a boil. Reduce heat &
simmer 45 minutes, until chicken is tender. Remove chicken from
stock. Strain & reserve 1 1/3 cups of stock. Refrigerate chicken for
17 1/2 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan or deep fat fryer,
heat all but 2 tbsp. vegetable oil over medium heat. 2. In a large
bowl, combine pancake mix, paprika, salt, pepper, 2 tbsp. vegetable
oil, eggs, eggs & reserved chicken stock. Generously coat each piece
of chicken w/ batter. 3. Fry chicken in batches w/o crowding 8 1/2
minutes, turning once, until golden brown & crisp. Remove & drain on
paper towels. Origin: Home Cooking Echo Shared by: Liz Norsworthy
