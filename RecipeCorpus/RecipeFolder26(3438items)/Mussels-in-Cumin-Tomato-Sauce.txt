Title: Mussels in Cumin-Tomato Sauce
Categories: Clam/oyster, Seafood, Tomato, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 lb Plum tomatoes; peeled
-coarsely chopped
1/2 c  Water
2 lb Live mussels
-scrubbed and debearded
Salt (opt)
Chopped cilantro to garnish
1 tb Canola oil
1 tb Garlic; minced
1 tb Ginger; grated
1 tb Jalape¤o pepper
-cored, seeded and minced
-or to taste
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Turmeric
Heat the oil in a large skillet, over medium-low heat. Add the garlic
and ginger and cook until golden, stirring often to prevent sticking.
Add the jalape¤o, cumin and turmeric and stir to distribute evenly.
Stir in the tomatoes and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce
the heat and simmer, covered, until a thick sauce forms, 15 to 18
minutes. Uncover several times and stir, mashing the tomatoes with
the back of a spoon to help form a sauce.

Discard any mussels with broken shells or shells that do not close
when tapped. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a
boil. Add the mussels, cover the pan and cook 4 to 5 minutes, gently
shaking the skillet occasionally. Remove the lid and check the
mussels; transfer opened mussels to a serving bowl and cover to keep
warm. Cover the skillet and continue cooking a few minutes more until
most of the mussels have opened. Add a little water if the sauce
sticks to the bottom of the pan. Discard any mussels that are still
closed. Taste the sauce for seasoning, adding salt to taste if
necessary. Pour the sauce over the mussels, sprinkle with cilantro
and serve.
