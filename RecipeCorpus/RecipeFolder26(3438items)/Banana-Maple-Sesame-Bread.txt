Title: Banana Maple Sesame Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
3 c  All-purpose flour or bread
-flour
3 tb Sesame seeds
1 tb (1 pk.) active dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
2    Very ripe bananas, mashed
1/3 c  Maple syrup
1 ts Salt
In large bowl dissolve the yeast in 1/4 c. of the warm water. After a
minute, add the remaining water, the mashed bananas, maple syrup,
salt, oil, whole wheat flour and stir in enough of the white flour to
make a stiff dough. Turn out onto a floured work surface and let rest
while you wash the bowl. Now knead the dough, adding more flour as
necessary to keep it from sticking, until it is smooth and elastic,
about 8 to 10 minutes. Grease the clean bowl lightly  and place the
dough in it, turning it to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise
till doubled in volume, about 1 1/4 hours.

Meanwhile roast the sesame seeds by heating them in a small skillet,
shaking the pan frequently, until they begin to turn color and smell
toasted. When the dough has risen, turn it out onto the floured work
surface, punch it down all over and flatten, sprinkle the cooled
sesame seeds on top, then knead long enough to dsitribute the seeds
throughout. Divide the dough in half, form into 2 loaves, and place
in greased 8" loaf pans. Cover lightly with a towel and let rise
until almost doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. Turn bread out
onto wire racks and let cool.
