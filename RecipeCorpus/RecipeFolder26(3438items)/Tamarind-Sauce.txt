Title: Tamarind Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Sugar
6 tb Rice wine vinegar
1 oz Dried tamarind
10 tb Hot water
1 ts Salt
Recipe by: Frugal Gourmet on our Immigrant Ancestors Soak the
tamarind in about 5 tablespoons of hot tap water.  Stir until you
have a paste. Strain the juice from the pulp, squeezing the pulp in a
small strainer. Discard the pulp.

Place another 5 tablespoons of water in a small saucepan.  Add 2
tablespoons of the tamarind juice, along with the remaining
ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for about 10
minutes, stirring often.  The color should look like a light brown
syrup.  You should have 3/4 cup liquid.  If not, add additional water
and heat again for just a moment.

Store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.
