Combine potatoes, eggs, and salt in a bowl; beat with a wooden spoon
to combine thoroughly. Add flour, enough to make a stiff dough; mix
well. With floured hands, shape dough into balls about 1 1/2 inches
in diameter. Drop into a large kettle of boiling water; bring water
to a slow boil again. Cook about 12 mins, or until dumplings rise to
the top. Test by tearing one dumpling apart with 2 forks. Remove with
a slotted spoon and drain. Serve with melted butter and a sprinkling
of bread crumbs, if desired. Makes about 18.
