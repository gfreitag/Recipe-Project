Yield: 1 servings
20 cn Crushed pineapple, drained
-(save if making sauce)
2/3 c  Pecans, chopped
1 c  Whipping cream, whipped
3/4 c  Crushed vanilla wafers
1/2 c  Butter or margarine,
-softened
1 1/2 c  Sifted icing sugar
1 ea Egg, beaten
Pack half of the crushed wafers into the bottom of a greased 8x8 cake
pan. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg and
continue beating. Add the drained pineapple and pecans, beat until
mixed. Fold in the whipped cream and spoon into pan.  Sprinkle
remaining crushed wafers over top and chill for at least 24 hours.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% PINEAPPLE SAUCE %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 1/2 cup sugar 1 tbsp cornstarch 1/4 tsp
grated lemon rind 8 oz crushed pineapple, drained (save) In small
saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch, mix well.  Measure reserved
pineapple juice, and if necessary, add water to make 3/4 cup.
Gradually add the pineapple juice to the sugar/cornstarch mixture,
stirring to dissolve lumps. Add the lemon rind and the crushed
pineapple. Bring to boil, stirring constantly. Boil until sauce is
thick and shiny. Cover and refrigerate. Makes 1-1/2 cups. I found
when I did the sauce, that by the next day, it was one solid lump.
Found it difficult to melt it to a nice consistency... If I was going
to do this again with the sauce, I would make the sauce just prior to
serving the cake.  My kids didn't care for the 'sauced' version, but
did like it without... Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by: Sharon
