1 x  Sweet potatoes
This is really great.  Michelle was the first one to mention this
last year so she gets full credit (yeah, she's also pretty busy these
days) Slice sweet potatoes the long way into around 1/4" (1 cm?)
slices. Brush with steak sauce - Lea & Perrins is vegan.  Trader
Joe's too. Let sit for a little while

Place on BBQ (Turn once)

The potatoes get that wonderful grill pattern on them too!

Buy potatoes that are straight and plump.  I've done this with both
orange and yellow flesh varietes with good success.  You may even be
able to use regular potatoes...
