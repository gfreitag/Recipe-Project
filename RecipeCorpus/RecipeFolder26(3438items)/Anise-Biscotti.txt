Title: Anise Biscotti
Categories: Fatfree, Dessert, Italian, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
3    Egg equivalents (comercial
Replacer, 6 whites, etc)
2 T  Grated fresh lemon zest (or
1 T  Dry)
1 T  Fresh lemon juice
2 c  + 2 Tbps flour
3/4 c  Sugar
1 T  Anise seeds, crushed
1 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Baking soda
1/4 t  Salt
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Coat baking sheet with non-stick
spray or parchment.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, anise
seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Whisk together egg
equivalents, lemon zest, and lemon juice, and add to the dry
ingredients. Mix well. Working on a floured surface, shape dough into
two logs, each about 14 inches long and 1-1/2 inches thick.  Set the
logs on prepared baking sheet, at least 4 inches apart (the dough
will spread during baking). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm to
the touch. Transfer the logs to the rack to cool. Reduce oven
temperature to 300 degrees F. Cut the logs diagonally into
1/2-inch-thick slices, using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing
motion. Stand the slices on their sides on the baking sheet and
return to the oven. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool
completely before storing. Biscotti will crisp as they cool.  Store,
in an air-tight container, up to one month. Makes about 4 dozen
biscotti.

note: I made 43 cookies, about 40 cal, < 1 g fat each, but it depends
on what you use for the "egg"
