Title: Poteca Nut Roll
Categories: Breakfast, Dessert, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 cake
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 ts Salt
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1/4 c  Shortening
3 c  Flour
1 pk Yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
3/4 c  Warm milk
1/4 c  Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 ts Lemon extract (opt)
4 c  Ground nuts
Milk
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Brown sugar
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
1 ts Vanilla
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water.  Add milk, sugar, salt,
egg, shortening and 1 1/2 c flour; beat until smooth.  Add enough
remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface,
knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 - 8 minutes. Place in a
greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Combine butter, brown sugar,
eggs, vanilla, lemon extract and nuts.  Add milk until mixture is of
spreading consistency (about 1/2 cup); set aside. Punch dough down.
Roll into a 30 x 20 inch rectangle. Spread filling to within 1 inch
of edges. Roll up from one long side; pinch seams and ends to seal.
Place on a greased baking sheet; shape into a tight spiral.  Cover
and let rise until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees
for 35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. If
desired, brush with a glaze of powdered sugar and milk.
