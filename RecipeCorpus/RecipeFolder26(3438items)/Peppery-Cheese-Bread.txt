Title: Peppery Cheese Bread
Categories: Bread, Cheese/eggs, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 ts Coarsely ground pepper
1 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Warm water (105-115 deg.)
2 c  All purpose flour
1 c  Cake flour
(Makes 1 loaf.)

Sprinkle yeast over water in small bowl; stir to soften. Let stand
until dissolved, about 5 minutes.

Combine 2 cups all purpose flour, cake flour and salt in large bowl.
Stir in yeast mixture and oil. Knead on floured surface until smooth
and resilient dough forms, about 10 minutes, adding more flour if
dough is sticky. Grease large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire
surface. Cover bowl with plastic. Let dough rise in warm draft-free
area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.

Line baking sheet with parchment. Punch dough down. Knead in cheese
and pepper on lightly floured surface. Divide dough into 3 equal
pieces. Roll between hands and surface into 14-inch ropes. Working on
prepared sheet, braid ropes together beginning in center and working
toward each end. Tuck ends under and pinch to seal. Cover with towel.
Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in
volume, about 1 hour.

Position rack in lower third of oven and line with baking tiles.*
Preheat oven to 400 deg. for 30 minutes. Brush loaf with cold water.
Slide loaf and parchment onto baking tiles. Bake 10 minutes. Mist
oven with cold water, using spray bottle. Bake 10 minutes longer.
Mist again. Continue baking until loaf is golden brown and sounds
hollow when tapped on bottom, about 25 minutes. Cool on rack. This
bread is best served the same day it is baked.

*If unavailable, bake bread on parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
