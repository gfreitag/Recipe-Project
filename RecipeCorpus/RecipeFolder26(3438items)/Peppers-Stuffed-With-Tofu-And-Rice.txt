Title: Peppers Stuffed With Tofu And Rice
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Rice
Yield: 1 servings
Then boiled or
Nuked
1 c  Tofu
x  Freshly ground black pepper
4    6 green bell peppers
(capsicum)
2 cn Campbells tomato soup
1    Onion, chopped fine
1    Rib of celery, chopped fine
1/2 c  Mushrooms, chopped fine
(optional)
1 c  Brown rice, cooked
1 c  Mixed vegetables, canned,
Frozen, or chopped fresh
All measurements are approximate! If making your own mixed veg I
suggest carrot, potato, corn, and peas. Cut the carrot and potato
small, to about the size of the peas and corn. Microwave until tender.

Saute onion, celery and mushrooms in lots of vegetable stock until
soft. Mix equal amounts of cooked rice, mixed veg. and tofu in bowl.
Add cooked onion mixture and freshly ground black pepper to bowl.

Slice the top off of the peppers and reserve. Remove the seed from the
peppers then add peppers to boiling water. Boil very briefly, about 2
~ 4 minutes. Remove from pot and rinse with cold water. Arrange
peppers in baking dish. Fill each with tofu mixture. (Extra stuffing
can be frozen). Pour tomato soup over the peppers. Replace cap over
each pepper (or sprinkle with low fat cheese). Put lid on baking dish
and bake at 180 degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about
45 minutes.
