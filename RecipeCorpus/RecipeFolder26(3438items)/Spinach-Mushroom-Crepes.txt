In a large skillet, saute mushrooms quickly  in balsamic vinegar or

skillet and set aside.  Wipe down skillet, saute onion in vinegar or
sherry, when translucent and tender, add spinach. As spinach wilts,
add scallions, parsley, basil or dill. Continue to saute until
vegetables are tender and little liguid remains.  Add chopped
tomatoes and saute for a few minutes to heat through.  Add reserved
mushrooms. Taste and adjust seasonings.

For sauce, put into blender rice, rice milk seasonings, and onion.
Process until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan and heat through.
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Roll up crepes with filling, place side by
side on a baking sheet.  Pour white sauce over crepes and heat for 10
to 15 min in oven.

Serve hot.

When I make the crepes, I always end up with 11 or 12, not 8. On
Sunday, it worked out perfectly, I had 12 crepes and all the filling
used up. Credit goes to JULAGAY (address name, there was no *regular*
name) for the white sauce. I found it in the archives and it worked
great! However, I was wondering, what are rice polishings? I just
used cooked rice. Enjoy! In case I don't post again, I wish everyone
the best over the holidays and in the new year!  May we all enjoy
extremely good health in the coming year!
