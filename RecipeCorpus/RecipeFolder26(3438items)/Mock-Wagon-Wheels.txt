Title: Mock Wagon Wheels
Categories: Chocolate, Cake/cookie, Candy
Yield: 2 servings
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
1/2 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Salt (optional)
Marshmallows
Dipping chocolate, melted
1/2 c  Margarine
1 c  White sugar
1 lg Egg
1/4 c  Milk
1 t  Vanilla extract
1 3/4 c  Flour
Cream margarine and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg, milk
and vanilla.  Beat well.  Mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt
(if using) together, and gradually add to creamed mixture.  Beat
well... Preheat oven to 350F.  Using tbsp, drop mixture onto cookie
sheets, allowing room to spread.  Bake for about 8 minutes.  Cut
marshmallows if using large. After baking for 8 minutes, remove from
oven, place marshmallows onto half of the cookies, and then return to
oven for about 2 more minutes, or until marshmallows have melted
sufficiently.  Remove from oven, place on rack to cool.  Take the
cookies without marshmallow on them, and use them as 'lids' to create
the cookie sandwich.  Allow to cool completely. Dip into melted
dipping chocolate and let sit on waxed paper until chocolate hardens.
You can make your chocolate cookies any size you want, just alter the
baking time, and the amount of marshmallows needed to cover base.
