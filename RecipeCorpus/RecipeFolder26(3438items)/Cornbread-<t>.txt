Title: Cornbread <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Nuts/grains, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Salt
1 T  Applesauce
3/4 c  Skim milk
2    Egg whites
1 c  Cornmeal
1/2 c  Flour (I use unbleached)
1 T  Baking powder
1 T  Sugar
This is plain cornbread, not a corn flavored cake, so don't expect it
to be fluffy or sweet. It's great with black-eyed peas, new potatoes,
green onions, sliced tomatoes, and buttermilk, i.e., your basic
Southern farm fare. It's also very nice cold, broken into bite-sized
pieces in a glass of cold milk and eaten with a spoon.

Preheat oven to 425F. Grease pan (I use our #5 cast iron skillet - 8"
dia.) with a dab of olive oil on a paper towel (or spray with Pam)
and put in oven to preheat. Mix all ingredients, pour batter in
heated pan, and bake for 20 min. Cut into six medium or eight small
pieces.
