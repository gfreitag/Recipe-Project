Title: Chicken Chipotle Adobo
Categories: Tex/mexican, Chicken, Chilies
Yield: 6 servings
1    Chipotle Chile, Seeds and
-Membrane Removed
6 lg Chicken Breasts, Boneless
2 c  Adobo Sauce
This dish is so easy to prepare and if you enjoy the smoky flavor of
Chipotle Chiles and Adobo sauce it ranks high.

I use an Adobo sauce that is available commercially and comes in a
concentrated paste that is reconstituted with water to measure two
cups.

Prepare the Adobo sauce and set aside.  Remove the seeds and membrane
from one Chipotle Chile.  Mince the chile as fine as you can get it,
then combine it with the Adobo sauce.

Rinse and pat dry the chicken breasts.  Coat an electric skillet with
pam and pan fry the chicken breasts until they are nicely browned.
Add the Adobo sauce and lower the heat to medium-low and continue to
cook until the sauce is heated through and the chicken breasts are
well coated.

Serve the chicken with Spanish Rice and refried beans or Mexican
Stewed Tomatoes.

My wife is only in the early stages of becoming a chilehead and she
thought this dish was wonderful.

Note: In Southern California we have a commercial adobo sauce called
Rogelio Bueno Authentico Adobo that comes in an 8 1/4 ounce jar.  It
sure beats going through the trouble of making the sauce from scratch
and saves a lot of time.
