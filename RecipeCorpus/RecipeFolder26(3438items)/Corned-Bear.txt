Here is something I found tucked away in the back of my recipe file.
I can vouch for the fact that it will make good eating, but the first
ingredient is not always handy when you want it. Another essential
for this is a 20 gallon keg or stoneware crock. Salt the meat down in
layers in the keg, alternating layers of salt and meat. Let stand 24
hours. As soon as you finish salting the meat, mix the sugar, soda
and saltpeter in the water and let stand.  After the meat has been in
the salt for a day, pour the sugar solution over the meat in the keg.
Keep the meat cover with liquid - a plate with a brick or rock on it
will help hold the meat down in the solution. After 4 days drain the
liquid from the keg into a large enamel pan and bring the liquid to a
boil. Strain out the blood residue by pouring the liquid through
cheesecloth.  Return the solution to the keg and put the plate and
rock back to hold down the meat.  Now store the keg in a very cool
place for 4 to 6 weeks. Use the meat as you would corned beef.
