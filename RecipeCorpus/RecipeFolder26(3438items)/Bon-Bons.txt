Yield: 100 servings
4 c  Coconut or nuts or 1/2 & 1/2
24 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
1/2    Bar of household parafin wax
1 cn Eagle Sweet. Cond. Milk
1/4 lb Butter; softened
2 lb Powdered sugar
1 ts Vanilla
Mix together all except choc chips and wax. Mix will be stiff. Form
into sm balls, about 3/4" diameter. Place balls on wax paper on
cookie sheet. Chill for 1 hour or more. Melt choc chips and wax in
top of double boiler, making sure not to let water boil, as it will
ruin the chocolate! When melted and blended use a toothpick to pick
up each ball and dip the ball into the chocolate mix. Set on wax
paper, remove toothpick. When each tray is done use a spoon with a
small amount of chocolate on it to cover the hole where the toothpick
was removed. If the chocolate doesn't stick ~it is too hot. Store
refrigerated in sealed container. Stores well. Ruth from PA
