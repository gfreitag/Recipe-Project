If you're using live crabs, you'll have to scald them.  Bring 8 cups
of water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the crabs and scald for 3
minutes. Remove the crabs from the water and allow to cool [don't
throw away the water].  Pry off the top shell of the crabs and remove
the legs. With a small spoon, remove the rich yellow fat and reserve.
Remove the gills and inedible parts.  Return the crab shells and legs
to the pot of boiling water along with the shrimp heads and shells.
Reduce heat and simmer while you make the roux. Slowly make a roux
with the oil and the flour. When dark brown, add the onions, celery
and green bell pepper. Saute until vegetables are wilted.  Meanwhile,
strain the stock and measure 5 cups.  Slowly add the stock to the
roux, stirring and blending.  Simmer for 45 minutes. Add the crabs,
lump crabmeat and shrimp along with the seasonsings and reserved fat.
Cook for 15 minutes.  Add chopped green onions and serve immediately
over rice in soup bowls.  Garnish with minced parsley.
