Title: Carl's Sourdough Bread
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 40 servings
1 c  Oatmeal, dry
1/4 c  Wheat germ
1/4 c  Oat bran, dry
1/4 c  Wheat bran
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
OPTIONAL
1/4 c  Hops
1 c  Sourdough starter
2 1/2 c  Buttermilk, fresh or
-from dried.
1 tb Canola oil
1 oz Yeast, active 1 pkt
1/4 c  Honey
3 c  Bread flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1/8 c  Gluten flour
The night before mix starter and warm milk and 2 C bread flour, and
place in warm draft free place over night. (I use the oven with the
light turned on - stays about 85 degrees). OPTIONAL: Boil 1 qt of
water and add 2 T dried hops and let steep for 1/2 hour.  Use the hop
tea for all the fluid in the recipe. Next morning, mix yeast and 1 T
sugar with 3 T warm water and set aside till foamy. Grand oatmeal
into flour in blender. Add oil, yeast, honey, whole wheat flour.
Sprinkle salt and baking soda over batter and stir lightly. Let sit
for 30 - 50 min till bubbly and has risen to near double. Add wheat
germ, wheat bran, oat bran, oatmeal, gluten flour, and bread flour
till won't take any more.  Place on floured board and knead 5 min
till silky smooth and elastic.  Place in bowl in draft free place
till double in size.  Knead again and shape. FOR LOAVES: Shape into 2
or 3 1# loaves, and set aside till rise to full size. Place skillet
or large pan in bottom of oven, place 3 C water in pan for steam.
Bake bread 400 for 20 min, reduce heat to 325 for 20 min, then place
on rack too cool. FOR CLOCHE:  Shape into ball, sprinkle bottom of
cloche with wheat germ, place cover on cloche and place in draft free
area till full size.  Bake at 375 for 30 min, remove lid to brown for
10 to 15 min.  Turn out onto rack. The bread has extra dietary fiber
so is good for you and the hop tea speeds up the fermenting so the
dough rises faster.
