MMMMM-------------------HOW TO STORE CHOCOLATE------------------------
Store chocolate tightly wrapped or covered in a cool, dry place or
in the refrigerator.  If refrigerated, let it warm to room
temperature before using.
Occaionally, there may be a slight graying or "bloom" on
chocolate. This does not alter the quality or flavor and when used in
a recipe, the chocolate will regain its color.
