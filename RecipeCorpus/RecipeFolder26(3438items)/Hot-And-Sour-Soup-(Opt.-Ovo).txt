Title: Hot And Sour Soup (Opt. Ovo)
Categories: Fatfree, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Barbecue sauce as the
Original recipe called for
Sliced barbecue pork
1    Cake tofu cut in 1/2" cubes
x  Watercrest and bamboo shoots
Sliced (rarely have them on
And)
1    Tomato sliced and diced
1/4 c  Mushrooms sliced
1/4 c  Red and green pepper sliced
2    Spring onions chopped
1 1/2 t  Corn starch (approx)
3/4 c  Sweet and sour sauce (I use
The "Joy of Cooking")
2 c  Water
1 T  Vinegar
1 T  Brown sugar
1    Egg (optional)
1 t  Hot sauce (I use a
Combination of tobasco and
Worchestersire
Sauce and season to taste
Which for me normally
Requires more than 1
Teaspoon)
In a sauce pan add sweet and sour sauce, water and egg and beat.
Apply heat and add all other ingredients. As soup nears a boil add
sufficient corn starch mixture to thicken. Continue to apply heat
until soup thicken. Do not over cook as it is best when the
vegetables are still crispy.

If the perspiration is not dripping from your brow can it really be
called hot and sour soup?
