1    Spaghetti Squash
1 pk Sliced mushrooms
1 md Zuchinni squash

Bake spaghetti squash at 375 F until slightly tender.  (Make sure to
puncture skin before baking.)

"Stir Fry" mushrooms, diced zuchinni squash, peppers until soft with
sherry.  When spaghetti squash is done, cut in half, remove seeds and

You will probably need a large wok to hold it all.
