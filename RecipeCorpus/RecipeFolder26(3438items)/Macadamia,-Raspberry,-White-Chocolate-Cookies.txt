DESCRIPTION: These tasty drop cookies are a jumble of macadamias,
white chocolate and raspberry jam.

Cream butter and sugars.  Add egg and beat in.  Add vanilla and
raspberry jam.  Mix well.  Mix together flour and baking soda.
Gradually add flour mixture to batter. Stir in nuts and chips. Drop
by rounded teaspoonfuls onto lightly greased cookie sheets, about 2"
apart. Bake at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes. Don't overbake. Cool on
racks. Posted by Bettie cooper 1-93. TERRY'S NOTES:  These freeze
well. Freeze on sheets until solid then transfer to zip-lock bags.
I've made with semisweet chocolate chips, and, though not as pretty,
are just fine! Formatted by Theresa Grant, HWWK11b.
