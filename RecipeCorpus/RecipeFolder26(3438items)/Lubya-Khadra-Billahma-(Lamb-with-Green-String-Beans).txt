Title: Lubya Khadra Billahma (Lamb with Green String Beans)
Categories: Middle east, Arab states, Beans, Lamb, Tomato
Yield: 4 servings
;or 2 cups chopped, drained,
;canned tomatoes
1 ts Salt
Black pepper; freshly ground
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg; preferably
;freshly ground
1/2 ts Ground allspice
2 lb Green String Beans; trimmed
;and cut into 2 inch lengths
3 tb Olive oil
1 lb Lamb, boneless stewing; cut
;into 1 inch cubes
1 c  Onion; finely chopped
6 md Tomato; fresh, ripe, peeled,
;seeded and coarsely chopped
Spread the beans evenly in the bottom of a heavy 4 to 6 quart
casserole, and set aside.  In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat the
oil over moderate heat until a light haze forms above it.  Add the
lamb and brown it, turning the pieces frequently with a spoon and
regulating the heat so they color deeply and evenly without burning.
As they brown, transfer the pieces of lamb to the casserole, placing
them on top of the beans.
Pour off all but a thin film of fat from the skillet, and in it
cook the onions over moderate heat for 5 minutes, or until they are
soft and transparent but not brown.  Spread the onions over the lamb
and cover them with the tomatoes.  Sprinkle the top with salt, a few
grindings of the pepper, the nutmeg and allspice.  Place the
casserole over low heat, cover tightly, and simmer without stirring
for 1 hour, or until the beans and meat are tender.  Serve at once
from the casserole, accompanied, if you like, by steamed or boiled
rice.
