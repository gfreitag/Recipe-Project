Title: Huli-Huli Roasted Chicken
Categories: Chicken, Bbq/grill, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Honey
1 c  Dark or regular soy sauce
1 c  Lime juice
3 ts Light brown sugar
3 lb Chicken
Salt & pepper
4    Sprigs fresh thyme
2    Garlic cloves; sliced thin
Prepare the grill. Season the inside of the chicken with salt and
pepper. Place the thyme and garlic under the skin on the breast.
Combine the honey, soy, lime juice, and brown sugar, stirring until
the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Place the chicken on the spit and
brush with the glaze every few minutes until the glaze starts to
stick to the chicken. Continue to roast until chicken is done, about
l l/2 hours. Remove the chicken from the spit and let rest for l0
minutes before carving. If a spit is not available, just roast the
chicken in the oven on a rack with a cup of water in the roasting
pan. The chicken juices, marinade and water will mix to make a
wonderful glaze to baste the chicken with about every 5-l0 minutes.
Roast at 325~ for l l/2 hours. Make 4 servings.
