In a mixing bowl or electric mixer, beat the butter briefly at medium
speed, then add the sugar and beat until fluffy. Add the egg yolks
one at a time, then lower the mixer speed and add the flour
alternately with the water. Gather the dough into a ball, wrap in
plastic, and chill at least 30 mins. 2. BLACKBERRIES: Place 1 cup of
blackberries in a large kettle with the sugars, salt, nutmeg, lemon
juice, and water. Bring to a boil, covered. Cook over medium heat for
20 mins. Remove from heat and stir in the rum, butter, and remaining
3 cups of blackberries. Set aside. 3. Roll out the chilled dough to a
rectangle about 12 inches long and 1/8 inch thick. Cut the dough into
strips 2 inches wide; then cut the strips crosswise into 3-inch
lengths. Return the berries to the boil, covered; uncover the kettle
and boil for 10 mins. carefully drop the pieces of the dough onto the
berries, using 2 forks to keep the pieces of dough separated (they
will come together slightly; that's fine). 4. When all of the pieces
of dough are in, cover the kettle and lower the heat to medium-low.
Cook until the dough is set, 12 to 15 mins. Cool slightly, then serve
warm in bowls, passing a pitcher of cream at the table.
