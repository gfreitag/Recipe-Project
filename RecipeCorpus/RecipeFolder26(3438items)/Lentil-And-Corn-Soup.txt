Corn and sweet potatoes give this soup a nice sweetness. It's adapted
from Mark Bricklin's _Lose Weight Naturally Cookbook_ (Rodale), which
uses too much meat and dairy for our purposes; this one, however,
adapts well by substituting for the oil in the saute. It also freezes
and microwaves well for brown-bag lunches.

Saute the onion and carrots in a large saucepan over low heat,
stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent.

Add water, lentils, tomatoes, corn, and sweet potato. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat, cover and simmer for 25 min. Add the tamari, rice and
parsley, and heat through before serving.
