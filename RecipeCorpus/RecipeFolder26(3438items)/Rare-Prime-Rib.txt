Title: Rare Prime Rib
Categories: Meat
Yield: 16 servings
Black pepper to taste
12 lb Prime rib roast
Salt to taste
Remove roast from the refrigerator ast least two hours before
beginning to cook. Place in a shallow roasting pan and liberally
sprinkle fatty top with salt and pepper. Pat in. To protect the oven
from spattering fat, place a tent of aluminum foil loosely over the
top of the meat. Preheat the oven to 500*F and when preheated place
roast in oven and roast for the times listed below. THE TIMES MUST
ABE ADHERED TO EXACTLY. Set a timer to remind you as a few minutes of
overcooking will ruin the roast. When the cooking time ends, turn off
the oven but DO NOT open the door. Allow the roast to remain in the
oven for at least 1 hour or until the oven is luke warm, which occurs
in about 2 hours. The roast will be beautifully rare inside and
retain a crunchy outside and an internal heat suitable for serving
for 2 hours. The roasting time works out to 15 minutes per rib or
approximately 5 minutes per pound. NOTES:  1. For a 2 rib roast
weighing 41/2 -5 lbs. allow 25 to 30 minutes at 500*F
2. For a 3 rib roast weighing 8-9 lbs. allow 40-45 minutes at
500*F
3. For a 4 rib roast weighing 11-12 lbs. allow 55-60 minutes at
500*F
4. Have your butcher prepare the roast by removing the chine
bone and cutting the meat from the bones. Then return the chine bone
and the meat to its original shape and tie the roast to hold it
together. This will facilitate your carving.
5. A small end Prime rib is always the best.
