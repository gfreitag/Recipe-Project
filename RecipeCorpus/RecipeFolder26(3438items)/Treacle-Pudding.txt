Title: Treacle Pudding
Categories: Bread, Breakfast, British, Pudding, Syrup
Yield: 4 - 5 person
Treacle (molasses)
-or golden syrup
1 oz Breadcrumbs
Water
2 c  Flour
4 oz Suet, finely chopped
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 pn Salt
1/2    Lemon rind, grated
Mix  the flour, suet, baking-powder, and salt together, and form into
a stiff paste with cold water. Divide it into two equal portions;
with one line the basin, from the other portion cut off sufficient
paste to form the lid, and roll the remainder out smoothly. Put a
layer of treacle in the basin, sprinkle liberally with breadcrumbs,
and lightly with lemon-rind. From the rolled-out paste cut a round
sufficiently large rather more than to cover the treacle, etc., in
the basin, moisten the edges of it with water, and join them
carefully to the paste lining the basin. Now add another layer of
treacle, breadcrumbs and lemon-rind, and cover with pastry as before.
Repeat until the basin is full, then cover with a greased paper, and
steam for about 2-1/2 hours. Sufficient for 4 to 5 persons
