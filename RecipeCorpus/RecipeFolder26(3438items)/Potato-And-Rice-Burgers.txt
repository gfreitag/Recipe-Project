In a bowl, combine sauce ingredients.  Place in refrigerator to chill.
Prepare grill or griddle.  Boil potato in water over medium heat until
tender, about 10 min.  Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in a
medium bowl.  Drain potato and mash with a fork or masher.  Add
potato to bowl, mix well and form into 4 thin patties. If potato
mixture is too dry to hold together, add a little water before making
patties.  Grill patties 4 to 5 min. on each side until lightly
browned.  Serve on hamburger buns with sauce and your choice of
fixings.

I don't have a grill so I broiled mine instead and they turned out
great! Brown and crispy!  These have a nice taste.
