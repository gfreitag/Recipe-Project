in the bacon grease. Add cabbage and peeled, cubed apple and crumbled
bacon. Fill up with water until the cabbage is well covered. Cook
until soft and then season with vinegar and sugar to taste. Add salt
to taste. This can be warmed up again and again, and it gets better
the more it is warmed up."
