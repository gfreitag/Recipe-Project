Wash cauliflower and trim off stem and leaves. Put in a kettle with 2
cups lightly salted water and lemon juice. Cook, uncovered, 5 mins.
Cover and cook another 15 mins. Drain, reserving liquid. Cut
cauliflower into small pieces. Melt 2 Tbs of butter in a large
kettle; mix in flour. Gradually add cauliflower liquid.; cook slowly,
stirring, until a thick sauce. Add 4 cups of water, cauliflower
pieces and mace. Season with salt and pepper. Cook slowly, covered,
for 25 mins longer, until cauliflower is mushy. While soup is
cooking, make dumplings. Cream rest of butter in a small dish. Stir
in bread crumbs, egg and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. The
mixture should be quite firm. Form into tiny marble-sized balls and
leave at room temperature while soup cooks. When soup is done, drop
dumplings into the soup; leave soup on heat until dumplings rise to
the top. Serves 6 to 8.

NOTES : The Czechs created several interesting dishes with
cauliflower,
karfiol. This soup is simple but flavorful. The dumplings are
actually small balls of bread crumbs.
