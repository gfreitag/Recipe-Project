No low-calorie candy has ever wrung the teeniest notice from our
tongue, so truffles are our dreamiest dream, And these will melt like
creamiest cream. In a double boiler, the chocolate fix and to this
the melted butter mix, then add the sugar, vanilla, and wine And stir
till it is blended fine. Now cool till firm (not hard nor brittle)
you might need cream here ~ just a little-spread the cocoa on a plate
or slab, P>: Roll each ball in the cocoa, a spoon-site dab. Now
lovingly wrap each tiny ball and your con- fection will top them all.
