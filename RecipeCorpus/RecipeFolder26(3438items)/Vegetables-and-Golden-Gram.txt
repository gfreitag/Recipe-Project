turmeric and salt, in a covered pan.  Reduce the heat so that the
beans simmer.
While the beans cook, heat 1 tablespoon  of the oil in a large
skillet, and in it stir fry the potatoes, carrots and cauliflower
until the potatoes have turned light brown.  Remove this vegetable
mixture to a dish.
When the gram is three quarters cooked (after about 30 minutes),
add to it the sugar, green beans, cabbage and radishes.  When these
vegetables are tender (after about 15 minutes), add the tomatoes,
peas, green chilies and coriander leaves, and remove the bean mixture
from the heat.
Heat another 1 tablespoon of the oil in the skillet over medium
heat, and fry the dried chilies, cumin, cinnamon and cardamom for one
minute. Add the bay leaves, ginger and onions, and stir fry this
seasoning mixture for about 10 minutes.  Combine the vegetables,
beans and seasonings in the skillet, and simmer everything together
for 10 minutes. Finally, add the garam masala, remove from the heat
and serve, if you like, with rice. misc02
