Categories: Bread, Fatfree
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  Cake flour
Additional flour for
Dusting
2 c  Chappati Flour
OR
1 c  Whole-wheat flour mixed w/
Put the flour in a bowl.  Slowly add enough water so that you will be
able to gather the flour together and make a soft dough. You may need
about 2 1/2 tablespoons less than a cup of water. Knead the dough for
7 to 8 minutes or until it is smooth.  Make a ball and put it inside
a bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth and set it aside for
half an hour.

If the dough looks very runny, flour your hands and knead for another
few minutes.  Form twelve equal balls and dust each with a little
flour. Keep them covered.

Set a cast-iron griddle or skillet to heat over a medium-low flame.
Allow at least 5 minutes for that. Keep about a cup of dusting flour
near you. Remove a ball of dough and flatten it between the palms of
your hands. Dust it on both sides with flour.  Roll it out, as thinly
and evenly as you can, aiming for a 5 1/2 inch round. When the
griddle is hot, slap the roti onto its heated surface.  Cook for
about a minute or until soft bubbles begin to form.  Turn the roti
over. Cook for half a minute on the second side.

If you have a gas fire, light a second burner on a medium flame and
put the roti directly on it.  Using tongs, rotate the roti so that
all areas are exposed to the shooting flames. Take 5 seconds to do
this. Turn the roti over and repeat for about 3 seconds. The roti
should puff up. Put the roti on a plate and cover with a towel. Make
all roti this way.

If you have an electric stove, place the griddle and roti under a
broiler for a few seconds, until the roti puffs up. Serve hot.
