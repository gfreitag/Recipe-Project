Recipe by: FWDS07A    Patricia Dwigans Heat milk unti it reaches 100
f on a thermometer. Remove from heat and stir inyogurt. Pour mixture
into a clean plastic container, cover tightly and let stand in a warm
place for 18-24 hours. Be sure to punch a small hole in container lid
to let gases escape. Mixture should resemble the consistency of
yogurt. A curt should form and the mixture should not flow readily
whe the cotainer is slightly tilted. If clear liquid rises to the top
of mixture, simply stir it back in. If iquid or starter turns pink,
discard mixture and start again. After curd has formed gradually stir
in 1 cup flour into the starter until smoothly blended. Cover tightly
and let stand in a warm place until mixture is full of bubbles and
has a good sour smell, approx 2-5 days. If clear liquid forms on top
of mixture , stir it back into starter. Each time you use part of
your starter replenish it with equal amounts of warm milk and flour.
Cover and let stand in a warm place several hours or overnight until
it is full of bubbles. Cover and store in refo until needed. Starter
should always be at room temp before using. Low fat or skim milk may
be used in place of whole milk. Always be consistent in type of milk
used.
