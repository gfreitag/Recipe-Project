Title: Corned Beef Hash
Categories: Mom's, Beef, Main dish, Potato
Yield: 4 servings
Salt
4 tb Butter
5 tb Heavy cream
2 c  Chopped cooked corned beef
2 c  Chopped boiled potatoes
1 sm Onion, chopped fine
Fresh ground pepper
Mix the beef, potatoes, onion and pepper and salt to taste; be
careful, the beef is salty! melt the butter in a 10 inch skillet;
cast iron is best. Spread the mixture over the bottom of the pan and
press down with a spatula. Fry over medium-low heat for 15-20
minutes. Use the spatula and take a peek at the underside. If it is
nicely browned, turn the hash over. Slide it out onto a dinner plate,
and invert the plate over the skillet. Pour the cream evenly over the
meat and cook another 15-20 minutes, until the second side is nicely
browned. Source: Fanny Farmer cookbook Typed for you by Linda Fields,
