"A little history:

Every ancient Polish manor has its own cookery book, the growth of
centuries, carefully bound, exquisitely-penned recipes, yellow with
age. Amoung those recipes we should not fail to find one for Bigos, a
most delectable dish served at every hunting party. In Pan Tadeusz,
Mickiewicz said, "There has been a bearhunt. The bear is killed, a
great fire is made and while the Bigos is warming in a mighty pot,
the hungry hunters drink crystal clear, goldenflecked wodka from
Gdansk."
