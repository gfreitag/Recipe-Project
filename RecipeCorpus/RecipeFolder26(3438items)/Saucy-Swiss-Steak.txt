Dredge the steak in the flour.  In a large Dutch oven over medium-high
heat, melt the butter and add the steak cooking until browned on both
sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove the steak to a platter. Add the onion,
green pepper, celery and garlic to the Dutch oven and cook over
medium-high heat 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until tender and
light brown. Add the tomatoes with their liquid and the bay leaf and
bring to a boil. Return the meat to the Dutch oven and reduce the
heat to low. Simmer, covered, for 2 hours or until the meat is
for-tender turning the steak over after 1 hour. Remove the steak to a
platter and keep warm  Over medium-low heat bring the sauce to a
simmer and simmer, uncovered, about 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly. Discard the bay
leaf. Slice the meat and pour the sauce over the meat before serving.
