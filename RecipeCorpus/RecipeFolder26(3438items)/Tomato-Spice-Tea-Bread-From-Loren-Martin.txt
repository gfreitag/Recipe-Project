Categories: Bread, Tomato, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking powder
Pinch of salt
1/4 c  Sliced almonds
2    Large, ripe tomatoes
2    Eggs
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
Peel and seed the tomatoes.  Place in a blender or food processor and
coursely puree.  Measure out 1 1/4 cups puree.  With electric mixer,
blend the eggs, oil and sugars.  Beat at high speed for 3 minutes, or
until batter is light and fluffy.  Add the tomato puree and mix well.
In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients, except the almonds, and
add gradually to the moist.  Beat at medium speed until thoroughly
blended; the batter will be thin.  Grease 6-cup Bundt pan or an
8-inch loaf pan. Pour batter evenly into pan and sprinkle top with
almonds. Bake for 40 minutes at 375 F, or until skewer inserted into
center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 5 minutes, turn onto rack and
cool before slicing into thin slices.
