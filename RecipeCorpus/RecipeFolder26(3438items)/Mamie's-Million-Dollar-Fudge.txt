fame for her sumptuous fudge, which Ike named and often enjoyed.
=======================================================
================ Heat the sugar, butter, salt, and evaporated milk
over low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil
and boil for 6 min. Put chocolate bits, German chocolate, marshmallow
cream, and nutmeats in a bowl.  Pour the boiling syrup over the
ingredients. Beat until the chocolate is all melted, then pour in a
pan. Let stand for a few hours before cutting.  Remember, it is
better the second day. Store in a tin box. Source:  Farmer's Almanac,
