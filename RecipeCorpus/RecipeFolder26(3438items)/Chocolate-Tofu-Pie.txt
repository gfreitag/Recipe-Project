Categories: Fatfree, Pie/tart, Chocolate, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST-------------------------
Or enough water to moisten)
10    Graham crackers
1/4 c  Margarine  (1/4 c applesauce
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Skim milk or soy milk
1/3 c  Honey
1 T  Vanilla extract
1 c  Semi-sweet chocolate or
Carob chips
1 lb Soft or silken tofu (lowfat
Tofu)
Preheat oven to 350 F. Pulverize the graham crackers in blender or
food processor until finely ground. Add the margering to the
container, and process until well integrated with the graham cracker
crumbs. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a nine
inch pie pan.

Melt the chocolate or carob chips with 2 Tbsp of water in a heavy
saucepan or double boiler. Combine the tofu with the melted chips and
remaining ingredients in blender or food processor. Process until
velvety smooth. Pour into the pie crust and bake for 30-35 minutes,
or until the filling is firm and the crust is golden. Serve at room
temperature or chilled.

Like I said, without the vlf subs the recipe is tested. I'm going to
be experimenting with this soon and post any successes. I love to
feed this to my carnivorous SO. He never guesses, heehee.
