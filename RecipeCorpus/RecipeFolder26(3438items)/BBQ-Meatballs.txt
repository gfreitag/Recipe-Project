Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-------------------------MEATBALLS------------------------------
2 c  Dry bread crumbs
2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Pepper
1/2 t  Ground allspice
(I use a 1/4 tsp.)
2 lb Ground beef
1 lb Bulk pork sausage
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
1 c  Milk
1    Egg, lightly beaten
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 1/2 t  Sugar
1 t  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 t  Dry mustard
1/2 t  Salt
1/8 t  Pepper
1 T  Oil
1/4 c  Onion, minced
8 oz Tomato sauce
1 T  Lemon juice
1 T  Brown sugar
MEATBALLS:  Mix all ingredients for "Meatballs".  Form into 1" balls.
Cook in a single layer in a 350 degree oven for about 20-30 minutes
or until browned.  Remove and drain.

SAUCE: Cook onion in oil till tender.  Add remaining ingredients.
Simmer 10 minutes.  Place meatballs in a crock pot.  Pour sauce over
and keep warm.

Can be made a day or so ahead, refrigerated in the crock, and
reheated. The sauce doesn't make a lot, just enough to coat the balls.
