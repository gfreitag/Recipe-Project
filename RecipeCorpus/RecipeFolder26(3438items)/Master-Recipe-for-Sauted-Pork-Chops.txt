Categories: Pork, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
-minced, (1/4 cup)
1 md Garlic clove; minced
1/3 c  Dry white wine OR
1/4 c  Dry vermouth
1/2 c  Chicken stock
2 tb To 3 tb butter

-center loin or rib cuts

1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper

1. Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter
in a 10- to 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil; swirl
skillet occasionally until fat turns nut brown and just begins to
smoke.

2. Lay pork chops in skillet, bony side facing toward center of
skillet; saut축 until browned on one side, about 1 minute. Reduce heat
to medium; cover and cook until firm but not hard when pressed with a
finger, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer chops to a plate; set aside
in a warm spot while preparing sauce.

3. Spoon all but 1 tablespoon of fat from skillet. Add shallots; saut축
until softened, about 1 minute. Add garlic; saut축 until fragrant,
about 30 seconds. Add wine; boil until reduced by half, about 1
minute, scraping skillet with wooden spoon to dislodge browned bits.
Pour in stock and accumulated juices from around chops; boil to a
thin syrupy texture (about 1/3 cup), 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat,
scatter butter pieces over sauce; swirl skillet until butter melts
and sauce thickens slightly. Squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over
sauce and swirl in. Adjust seasonings. Spoon over chops and serve.
