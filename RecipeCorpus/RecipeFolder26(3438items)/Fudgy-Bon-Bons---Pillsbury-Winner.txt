Recipe by: Pillsbury Winner
In medium saucepan, combine chocolate chips and butter; cook and
stir over very low heat until chips are melted and smooth. Add
sweetened condensed milk; mix well.
In medium bowl, combine flour, nuts, chocolate mixture and vanilla;
mix well.
Shape 1 tablespoonful (use measuring spoon of dough around each
candy kiss, covering completely.
(this is not as messy as it seems, as the dough does not stick to
your hands, it is very buttery. It does not take much dough to cover
the candy. If you use too much you will have to bake a little longer)
Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in preheated 350 deg. oven 6 to 8 minutes. Cookies will be
soft and appear shiny but become firm as they cool. DO NOT OVER BAKE!
Remove from cookie sheets; cool.
In small saucepan, combine white baking bar and

shortening;cook and stir over low heat until melted and smooth.
Drizzle over cookies.
Store in tightly covered container. Makes 6 dozen cookies.
