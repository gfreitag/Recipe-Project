Title: Cranberry Fritters From Loren Martin
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 9 dozen
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Milk, plus 2 tb
3 c  Shortening or oil for deep-
Frying
1 c  Fresh cranberries, washed &
Drained well
3 c  Flour
1 1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Baking powder
Place the cranberries on paper toweling and dry well.  Sift together
the dry ingredients and mix in the milk, a little at a time, to make
a stiff dough.  Flour your hands well, pinch off a small piece of
dough (about 1 teaspoon), place a cranberry in the center, and roll
into a ball with the cranberry inside.  The balls should be about the
size of large marbles. Place the shortening or oil in a deep, heavy
kettle, and heat till it registers 375F on a deep-fat-frying
thermometer. Drop the fritters into the hot fat and fry, turning,
until deep golden brown on all sides. Drain on paper toweling.  This
really works best as a two-person operation, with one shaping the
fritters and the other frying them.
