Saute the onions in the oil in a soup pot over medium heat, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking.  While the onions cook, bring the
water to a boil in a separate pan.  Cut the potatoe in half
lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into 1/4-inch slices.  Keep
the slices together and cut them in half again lengthwise to make
wedge shaped pieces. When the onions are translucent, add the
paprika, thyme and bay leaves; saute for 1 minute. Pour the boiling
water into the onion mixture, then add the potatoes, sherry, salt and
pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered,
for about 10 minutes. Crumble in a pinch of saffron and continue to
cook until the potatoes are tender. Remove the bay leaves. Garnish
each bowl of soup with a sprig of parsley and a strip of pimiento.
Add a dash of Tabasco or a pinch of cayenne if you wish. Makes 4
