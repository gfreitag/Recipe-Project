Title: Correne's Fudge
Categories: Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 lb Margarine
18 ea Chocolate chips
1 lg Bag marshmallows (about 40)
1 c  Milk
4 c  Sugar
1 T  Vanilla
Bring the mik, sugar, butter and vanilla to a boil, and boil for 9
minutes. Mix the marshmallows and the chocolate chips in a large
bowl. Pour the boiled mixture over the chocolate and marshmallows,
stirring until completely melted and blended together. Scrape into a
greased pan and set in fridge until set.  Cut in very small squares
as this is a very rich fudge. This is an almost fool proof fudge.. I
wasn't paying attention to what I was doing, and was yacking to
someone in the kitchen. I was stirring the mixture and got a big
bottle of coke out of the fridge. Was going to pour myself a glass of
it, and without thinking, poured some coke into the boiling
mixture...  It still turned out fine... 8-} Origin: Correne Blaich,
