Put chicken, carrot, onion, parsley, salt, pepper and 5 cups of water
in a large kettle. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered,
for 2 hours, or unitl tender. The exact simmering time will depend on
the age of the chicken. Remove chicken from kettle to cool. Strain
broth and reserve. Cut meat into shreds. Out the walnuts through a
meat grinder twice. After each grinding reserve the oil separately
from the nuts. Soak bread in some of the strained chicken broth until
soft. Squeeze dry and mix with ground walnuts, onion and pepper. Put
this mixture through a meat grinder 2 more times. Then gradually add
about 1 cup of the strained chicken broth to the mixture to make a
paste or sort of mayonnaise-type sauce. Combine 1/2 of this sauce
with the shredded chicken and spread evenly on a platter. Cover with
remaining sauce. Garnish with the reserved walnut oil by sprinkling
it, along with the paprika, over the sauce.

NOTES:  The Circassians were an ancient tribe that inhavited the
western
part of the Caucasian Mountains, but their name has been used
:
for
all the inhabitants of the Caucasus.  In the past, Circassian
ladies were noted for their beauty, and many of them
:
:
introduced
native dishes to the courts of the sultans in Constantinople.
Thus this creation is popular in Turkey as well as in southern
Russia.  It makes an excellent buffet dish.
