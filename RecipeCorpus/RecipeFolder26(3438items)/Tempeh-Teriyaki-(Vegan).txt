1/2 lb Snow peas
1 lg Onion
8    Shitake mushrooms
1 lg Garlic clove
3 T  Canola oil (divided)
1/2 c  Homemade Teriyaki Sauce
Preparation: If using dried shitakes, soak in water to refresh. Cut
tempeh into thin slices.  Cut onion in thin slivers. Mince garlic.
Remove strings from snow peas, if necessary. Remove stems from
shitkes, and slice mushrooms thinly.

Heat 2 TB canola oil in saucepan or wok, gradually raising heat to
medium. Fry tempeh slices in batches, until one side becomes golden;
turn and fry other side until golden. Remove and drain on paper towel.

Add 1 TB canola oil and sesame oil to pan; raise heat to medium-hot.
Add snow peas,mushrooms, onions, and garlic; saute ONLY until onions
are translucent, not brown, and snow peas are bright green. Then add
drained tempeh.  While stirring and tossing, add the teriyaki sauce;
be careful to turn the heat down, as the sauce will sizzle
'dramatically' according to the author. Season with pepper.

Serve over brown rice, garnishing with slivered green onions and
almonds if desired.

Serves 4.
