Title: No-Oil Pizza Crust For Large-Loaf Bread Machines (Abm)
Categories: Fatfree, Breadmaker, Pizza, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  White bread flour
1 1/4 c  Warm water
2 T  Applesauce
1 T  Yeast
1 t  Sugar
1/4 c  Cornmeal
3 T  Whole wheat flour
put bread machine on white bread - manual setting and dump
ingredients in according to your machine's preferences

when cycle is all done, remove and separate into 3-4 balls of dough.
Place on floured wax paper and let rise for about 20 mins. more (add
a little flour if dough is too sticky). Shape, top, and bake til done
in a very hot oven (mine goes to 550 degrees).

Notes: When I didn't have cornmeal, I substituted whole wheat flour
and it worked just as well. Also, the first time I made it, I had to
use oil (my kids had eaten all of the applesauce) -- it worked just
the same, so the substitution of applesauce seems to make no real
difference in taste, texture, or appearance.
