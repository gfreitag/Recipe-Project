Title: Easy Spanish Rice  <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Rice, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Ground cumin
1 x  Salt (orginal recipe calls
For 1/2 t salt - I do not
Add salt)
1 3/4 c  Water (original recipe calls
For 2 C - I like my rice
Drier)
1    Chopped onion
1    Chopped green pepper
1 c  Uncooked rice
1/2 c  Canned tomatoes with green
Chilies (I use the diced
Ro*Tel brand)
1/4 t  Ground turmeric
Saute onion & green pepper in water until tender. Add remaining
ingredients to onion/green pepper Bring to boil - Reduce heat and
simmer till rice is done (time will vary according to kind of rice
used)

I have used both long grain brown rice and long grain Uncle Bens
Converted Rice (preferred by daughter) - both are good.

I frequently double the recipe and dump in the whole can of green
chilies (10 oz)
