Title: Lentil Chili
Categories: Vegetarian, Fatfree
Yield: 6 servings
4    Garlic cloves, minced
1 T  Chili powder
2 t  Cumin
1 t  Oregano
-salt to taste
-more cayenne to taste
2 c  Lentils
5 c  Water
28 oz Canned tomatoes
1    Bell pepper, chopped
2    Jalapenos, chopped
1 lg Onion, chopped
Rinse the lentils and cook until soft.  There will be extra water, but
since this is soup, that's okay.  Add the tomatoes and veggies, and
cook until the onion is soft.  Add the spices to taste.

Variations: As someone else pointed out, adding bulgur (or brown
rice) is tasty and satisfying. Add 1/2 cup of grain to the lentils
and add another 1 cup of water.

Shredded carrots and corn are also good.  In fact, I've found that
you can make just about any gloopy mass into chili by adding chili
powder. :-)

Kidney beans are also very good in this recipe.
