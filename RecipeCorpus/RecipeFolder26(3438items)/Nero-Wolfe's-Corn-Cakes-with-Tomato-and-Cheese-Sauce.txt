1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/4 lb Fontina cheese
2    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Tomato puree
1/2 ts Salt
2    Grindings black pepper
2 ds Tabasco (optional)

-THE SAUCE-
Combine the corn meal, flour, baking powder, black pepper and salt in
a bowl. In a small skillet melt the butter. Beat the eggs and add to
the corn meal with the melted butter. Mix well. Gradually add the
milk, stirring constantly until the batter is the thickness of heavy
cream. Heat the griddle, grease it, and pour out the batter by
spoonfuls to make cakes about two inches in diameter. Turn once so
they are nicely browned on both sides. Add more milk to the batter if
it begins to thicken. Serve as a side dish with plenty of butter. THE
SAUCE: Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour. Cook over a
low heat for 3 minutes and gradually add the warm cream, stirring
constantly. Cube the cheese and add to the sauce, a few cubes at a
time, until it is all melted. Remove from heat. Beat the egg yolks
with a little of the sauce and then add to the saucepan. Stir well
over low heat until the sauce has thickened. Add the tomato puree and
stir until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Add the
Tabasco if you like a hotter sauce.
