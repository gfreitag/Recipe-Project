Title: The Best Banana Bread (Ovo)
Categories: Fatfree, Fruit, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
4 tb Applesauce (baby applesauce
Is best, but any other is
Fine )
1    And 1/2 cups flour (I use
1/2    Whole wheat usually)
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
3 lg Bananas (enough to mash 1
Cup)
1 c  Sugar
x  Replacement for 1 egg (can
Be 2 egg whites or one egg
White and 1/3 c.
Non-fat yogurt if you use
Those things)
With a mixer, beat the mashed bananas with the sugar. Add the egg
replacer and applesauce and beat again.

In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients.  Add this to the banana
mixture and stir with a spoon until the dry stuff is all moistened.
Not too much stirring!

Pour batter into a loaf pan.  (About 5 x 9 inches, preferrably
non-stick or you can spray with Baker's Secret for a split second and
spread with a paper towel.)

Bake at 325 (be sure to preheat first) for about 55 minutes.

This is great the second day and freezes great, too. If you have
enough bananas make two and freeze one.
