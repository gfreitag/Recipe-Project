to crumble the beef, until browned.  Drain the mixture in a colander.

Return the beef mixture to the pan and add the chili powder, cumin,
sugar, oregano, tomato sauce, pinto beans, and chiles.  Cover and
cook for 10 minutes over medium-low heat.  Pour the mixture into a
2-quart casserole coated with cooking spray.  Set aside.

Combine the milk and egg in a bowl and stir well.  Add the cornmeal
mix and stir well. Pour the mixture over the beef mixture in the
casserole. Bake at 400F for 20 minutes, until the corn-bread topping
is lightly browned.

Makes 4 servings.

MAKE-AHEAD TIP: You can assemble the casserole ahead of time,
omitting the corn-bread topping.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator
or freeze (thaw the frozen casserole overnight in the refrigerator).

Let the casserole stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, add the
corn-bread topping and bake as directed.
