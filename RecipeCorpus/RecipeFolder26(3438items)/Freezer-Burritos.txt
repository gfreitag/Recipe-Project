Title: Freezer Burritos
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Vegetable, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
x  Dried basil, cumin, chili
Powder, cayenne pepper
1 pk Flour tortillas, burrito
Size
1 sm Can tomato sauce
2 cn Black beans
2    3 cups of cooked rice (your
Favorite kind)
1 lg Onion
3    To 4 cloves garlic
Saute onions and garlic in your favorite oil sub (I like to use
balsamic vinegar or cooking sherry).  When onion is soft, add spices
(sorry no measurements, I just throw on what looks good), cook a
couple of more minutes and remove from heat. In a large bowl, dump 1
can of beans with juice, drain the other can and then add the beans
to the bowl. Add the can of tomato sauce. Mash the beans until most
are mashed, but leave some unmashed.  Add cooked rice and onion
mixture. Stir well. Roll up burritos, freeze.  These make good
snacks, lunch or supper with a salad, and I love them for breakfast.
Enjoy!
