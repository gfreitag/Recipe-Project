skillet (read cast iron) over medium-high heat, add patties, and cook
until well browned on both sides. Remove from skillet and set aside.
Add sliced onion to skillet; reduce heat to medium, and saute until
onion is browned. Combine water, 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp seasoned
salt, salt and 1/4 tsp pepper; stir until smooth. Stir into skillet
and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Return steaks to
skillet, turning to coat with sauce. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer
15 mins.

NOTES:  This recipe yields a lot of gravy; naturally it is served
with rice and biscuits for sopping.
