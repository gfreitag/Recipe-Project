Title: Fresh Zucchini Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 ea Clove garlic, minced
2 tb Fresh Parsley;minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Seasoned Salt
Grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 lb Zucchini, grated
2 ea Slices bacon, diced
1 ea Small onion, chopped
2/3 c  Chicken broth
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Dried Basil
Saute bacon and onion until onion is limp.  Combine rest of
ingredients and cook until zucchini is tender.  Serve topped with
grated parmesan cheese.

Note: Zucchini may be shredded, cubed or sliced.  For an interesting
variation, try zucchini puree.  Or add tomato, either chopped or
puree. Soup is also good served chilled.  Very versatile and one of
my favorites.
