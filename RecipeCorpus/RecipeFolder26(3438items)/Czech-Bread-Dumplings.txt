Saute bread cubes in butter until golden and crisp. Remove to a large
bowl. Add eggs, milk and salt; mix well. Stir in enough flour to make
a soft dough. Mix vigorously to combine well. With floured hands,
shape dough into 6 dumplings. Drop into a large kettle of boiling
salted water. Boil, uncovered, until dumplings rise to the top. Cover
and cook 10 to 15 mins, or until done. Test by tearing one dumpling
apart with two forks. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain. Serves 6.
