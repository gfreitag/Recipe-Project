In a medium-size saucepan over high heat, bring the potatoes and
enough water to cover, to a boil and reduce the heat to medium -low
and simmer, covered, 30 minutes until the potatoes are tender when
pierced with a sharp knife.  Drain and let stand until cool enough to
handle. Meanwhile, finely chop the corn beef and onion then finely
chop the cooled potatoes. Place in a large bowl and toss to mix well.
Season the mixture with salt and shape into 6 large patties each
about 1/2-inch thick. In a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, melt 1
Tbls of the butter and add 2 patties cooking until browned on both
sides.  Remove from the skillet to a heated platter and keep warm.
Repeat the procedure with the remaining patties, using an additional
2 Tbls of butter for them.  Wipe out the skillet and return to medium
heat.  Melt 2 Tbls of butter in the skillet and fry the eggs in
batches to the desired degree of doneness, adding more butter if
necessary. Top each patty with a fried egg and serve immediately with
buttered toast and jelly.
