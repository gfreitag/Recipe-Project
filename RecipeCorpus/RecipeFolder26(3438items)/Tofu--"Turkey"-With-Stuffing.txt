:

Mash tofu or mix well with hands.  Be sure that all of the lumps are
out. Line a 12" colander with wet cheesecloth over lapping the sides.
Add the mashed tofu to the cloth covered colander, press down and
cover with the overlapping sides.  Place the whole thing in a large
bowl. Cover the cheesecloth with a plate that fits inside the
colander and place a 5 pound weight on the plate. Refrigerate and let
sit for 2 to 3 hours.

When time is up, start the stuffing.  Saute' the onions, celery and
mushrooms in the 2 tablesoons sesame oil.  When soft, add the garlic
and all the rest of the stuffing ingredients, except stuffing, mixing
well. Stir and cook for 5 minutes.  Add herb stuffing and mix well.

Remove tofu from fridge and take off weight, plate and top of
cheesecloth. Hollow out tofu to within 1 inch of the sides and
bottom, placing the tofu in a bowl.  Place the stuffing inside the
shell and pack in firmly. Cover with the remaining tofu and pat down
firmly. Turn stuffed tofu onto a greased baking sheet, flat side
down. Gently press on sides of "turkey" to achieve a more oval shape.
If desired at this point, you may mold "drumsticks" out of one pound
of tofu, and place on each side of the "turkey".

Mix up the basting mixture and baste tofu "turkey" with half of it.
Cover the "turkey" with foil, and bake at 400 degrees for about 1
hour.

Remove foil, baste with all the remaining mixture except a few
tablespoons and return to oven for 1 hour more, or until the "turkey"
is golden. Remove from oven and use rest of basting mix.  Using at
least 2 large spatulars, move to a large plate.  Serve with the gravy
of your choice, if you wish, and cranberry sauce. Tastes good
leftover (if there is any!) in sandwiches or plain.
