butter. Cool to lukewarm.  Measure warm ale into large bowl, sprinkle

seed (if used), and four cups flour mixture.  Beat until smooth.  Let
batter rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Stir down
batter, stir in enough additional flour to make a stiff dough.  Turn

12 minutes.  Place in warm place, let rise until doubled about 45
minutes.  Punch down dough, divide in half. Form into loaves or
rounds. Place in greased 9 by 5 loaf pans or on greased baking sheets
for rounds.  Cover, let rise in warm place until doubled, about 50
minutes.

Bake at 375 about 45 minutes for loaves or 35 for rounds.  Remove from
baking sheets and cool on wire racks.
