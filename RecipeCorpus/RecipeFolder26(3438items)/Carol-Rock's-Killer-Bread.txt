Title: Carol Rock's Killer Bread
Categories: Bread, Sourdough, Cheese/eggs, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Dried oregano
1 tb Onion; minced
1 tb Fresh parsley; minced
3 ts Cajun seasoning
3 tb Garlic; minced
1    Sourdough bread
-round loaf-10 inches
Butter; softened
1 c  Mayonnaise
1 c  Parmesan cheese; grate
1 tb Dried basil
Slice the loaf in half horizontally.  Butter cut sides of both
halves, and toast under broiler until lightly browned. Mix the
remaining ingredients and spread over both halves, using the entire
mixture. Bake at 400~ for 15 ~ 20 min, until top is brown and
slightly puffed. Cut into wedges and serve hot.  You can eat this
like  pizza as an entire meal, or along with a light meal.

My personal note*   It can be at it's super BEST when using FRESH
chopped basil and oregano - but triple the amounts when using fresh
herbs instead of dried!  Bake 2 times what you think you'll need,
because just between taking it out of the oven and cutting it in
slices for eating, you'll find 1/2 of it is gone before it ever
reaches the table!
