2 lb Finnan haddie (smoked

1 c  Water
1/4 c  Butter

Soak finnan haddie in water to cover for 1 hour. Drain and put into a
large saucepan, covering with the milk and water. Bring to a boil,
remove from the heat and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. When cooled,
remove the skin and bones, reserving the stock. Melt the butter in a
heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir in the flour and cook over direct low
heat until smooth. Add the cream and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved
stock; continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is
slightly thickened. Season with pepper and nutmeg. When the sauce is
thick enough to coat a spoon, remove it from the heat, measure out
1/4 cup, and set it aside. Break the finnan haddie into pieces and
fold them into the sauce. Simmer gently over low heat for a few
minutes until the fish is warmed. Pour the mixture into a shallow
casserole; cover with the pimiento and sliced hard-cooked eggs and
pour the reserved 1/4 cup of sauce over the eggs. Sprinkle the dish
with bread crumbs and place under a hot broiler to brown. Serve with
the anchovy toast.
