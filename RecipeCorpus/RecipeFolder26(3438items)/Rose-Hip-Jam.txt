Title: Rose Hip Jam
Categories: Vegetable, Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
3 1/2 c  Sugar
x  Water (Wine or sherry)
4 qt Rose hips with black ends
Removed
(about 5 pounds)
Gather the rose hips after the first frost. I am not sure why this is
done but I have several sources that say to do it, including my
grandmother, so I wait. Wash the rose hips well in case there is any
insecticide residue. Cover with water and simmer until the hips are
very soft and falling apart. Press through a food mill or colander to
remove the seeds and larger particles.  Press through a finer sieve
to remove the smaller fibers and seed bits.

Cook the pulp down until it is quite thick. How thick? That is hard
to say. Thicker than heavy cream.  I check the measurements at this
point. I add about a pound of sugar for every pound of pulp. The 3
1/2 cups is my measurement from the last time I made this.

Add the sugar and check the taste.  Sometimes I add a bit more sugar.
Rose hips have enough pectin to jell and enough ascorbic acid to make
it a little tart. Cook over high heat until the mixture has a thick
jam-like consistency. Put in jars.  Makes 4 half-pint jars
