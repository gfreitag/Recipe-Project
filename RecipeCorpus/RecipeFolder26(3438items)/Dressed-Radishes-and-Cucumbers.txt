Title: Dressed Radishes and Cucumbers
Categories: Fatfree, Dressing, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1    2 drops of toasted sesame
Oil (for flavour)
x  Sugar to taste
Optional - a scrape of fresh
Ginger livens it up, be
Careful with it.)
2    Parts vinegar
1    Part water (or sherry, if
You like)
1    Part soy sauce (I use
Tamari, or replace with
Salt)
Adjust the parts until the dressing is to your liking.  I like it
fairly vinegary.  The amount will depend on how much vegetable you
are dressing.

Radishes:  trim and slice thinly.  The Chinese lightly smash the
radish slices  (I use the bottom of a heavy glass), thus the salad is
called "Smashed Radishes" (great name for getting kids to try it).

Cucumbers: trim and slice thinly.  I like to score the cucumber before
slicing it, to give it an interesting design. I usually put the
radishes or cucumbers (or combined) in a plastic bag and pour the
dressing over. This way I can get the air out of the bag and not
worry about having to turn the veggies while they marinate.
Refrigerate for at least an hour. (Longer is okay, but the veggies
will look darker the longer they sit in the soy sauce dressing.)

I take this to lunch as a relish/salad when I'm tired of dill pickles
and pickled carrots.  I like the heat of the radishes.
