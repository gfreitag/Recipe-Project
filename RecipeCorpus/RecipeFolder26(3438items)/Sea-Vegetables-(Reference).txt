Title: Sea Vegetables (Reference)
Categories: Fatfree, Information, Vegetable, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings  x Nori x Hijiki x Wakame x Kombu

NORI: 8x10" paper-thin sheets.  Green if pre-toasted, purplish if
not. Also labeled 'dried laver'.  Also available as confetti-like
ribbons. For making vegan nori rolls (sheets) or sprinkling on top of
soba noodles, etc. (ribbons).  Nori can also be cut into squares and
toasted in a dry frying pan to eat as a snack.  Yum.  My parents used
to feed me this when I was a little kid.

HIJIKI: small 1/2-1" deep purplish-black strands.  Expands to about
2" long flowerlike things when soaked.  Strong tasting, good for
soups.

WAKAME: long 1/2" wide dark-green ribbons, expands to 1" wide when
soaked. Kind of slimy.  Good in miso or in stir fries.  Also sold as
1/4-1/2" thick rounds about 10" in diameter, with a rough surface.
This is just a more 'condensed' way of storing the stuff as far as I
can tell.

KOMBU:  8-10" wide, tough strips with a powdery white (salt) coating.
Used to flavor soup stocks, rice, etc.  Can also be cut into squares
and eaten but I don't like it, it's really tough and crunchy even
when cooked for a long time.  Maybe I just had a bad experience.
