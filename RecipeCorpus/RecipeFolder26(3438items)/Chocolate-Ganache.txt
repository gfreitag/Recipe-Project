Recipe by: 365 Great Chocolate Desserts - ISBN 0-06-016537-5 1. In a
2-qt glass measure, combine chocolate chips and heavy cream. Heat in
a microwave oven on high 3 mins, or until melted and smooth when
stirred. Stir in butter and vanilla.

2. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until ganache holds its
shape and is thick enough to spread on cake.

NOTE: You may substitute 3 cups of chopped semisweet or bittersweet
chocolate for the chips.

NOTES : This is an ideal frosting and filling for a large variety of
cakes. And it's a breeze to prepare with a little help from the
microwave.
