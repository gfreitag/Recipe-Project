Title: 100% Whole Wheat Bread (Abm)
Categories: Fatfree, Breadmaker, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 t  Salt
2 t  Active Dry Yeast
1 1/8 c  Water
3 c  Whole Wheat Flour
3 T  Sugar
This is pretty heavy bread, but I like it that way. For a better
raise, try adding 1/3 cup of gluten, and you may need a bit more
water, then.

Use Whole Wheat mode. Timer ok.

Note: Whole wheat varies greatly in how much water it absorbs. The
amounts of water shown are the ones that work for me. Check on the
dough after the first few minutes of kneading. If it is too thin, add
flour, 1 T at the time. If the dough is too dry and does not form a
smooth ball, add water, 1 T at the time. Since bread machines can
handle relatively moist do, it is better to err on the moist side
(which will result in heavier bread, if it is much too much).
