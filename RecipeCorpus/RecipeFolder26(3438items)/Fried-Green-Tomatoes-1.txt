first 5 ingredients; mix until smooth. Add additional milk to thin,
if necessary; batter should resemble pancake batter. Working in
batches, dip tomato slices into batter, allowing excess batter to
drip back into bowl. Fry in 2 inches hot oil (375Â°F) in a large heavy
skillet until browned, turning once carefully with tongs. Transfer to
a colander to drain. YIELD: 3 to 4 servings

NOTES : To keep the cooked tomatoes from getting soggy before they are
served, stand them up like wheels in the serving dish instead
of
stacking them.
