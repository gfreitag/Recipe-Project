Rinse the shrimp with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Put
the shrimp in a medium bowl, sprinkle with the wine, cover and
refrigerate until needed, up to 2 hours.

Bring a medium pan of salted water to a boil, add the green beans and
simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and
thoroughly dry on paper  towels. Cut the beans diagonally in 1
1/2-inch lengths and set aside.

In a small bowl, stir together the glaze ingredients and set aside.
Drain the shrimp well. Heat a wok or medium skillet over high heat.
Add half of the oil and when it is very hot, add the shrimp. Stir-fry
until the shrimp are firm and opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the
heat and set the shrimp aside.

Reheat the wok over medium-high heat and add the remaining oil.
Stir-fry the shallots, garlic and bell pepper until the bell pepper
begins to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the green beans and stir-fry
just until hot, about 30 seconds longer. Reduce the heat, stir the
glaze and pour it into the wok. Stir until thickened. Add the shrimp
with any juices and stir to combine. Pour onto an attractive serving
platter and garnish with sprigs of cilantro.
