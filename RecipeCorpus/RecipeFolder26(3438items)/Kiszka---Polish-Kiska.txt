Title: Kiszka - Polish Kiska
Categories: Sausage, Side dish, Pork, European, Can/preserv
Yield: 4 lbs kiska
1/2 ts Rubbed marjoram
Salt and pepper
3 lb Pork steak
2 lb Coarse buckwheat grits
Chop meat into coarse bits. Cover with water and boil until tender.
Add salt, pepper and marjoram. Wash the buckwheat grits, cover with
the liquid from the cooked meat, and steam in a double boiler for 1/2
hour. Combine the two mixtures. If you have sausage casings, stuff
the mixture into the casings. It will keep very well in a mold in the
refrigerator. Heat before serving.
