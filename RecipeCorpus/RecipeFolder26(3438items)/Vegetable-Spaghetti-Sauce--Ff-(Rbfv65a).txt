Have all the vegetables ready to cook - chopped and in containers.
Pour about 1 oz of white wine in a large lined pot. When wine is
boiling, dump in carrots and stir vigorously. Allow bottom to become
a little dry then add a small amount of wine. Continue until carrots
begin to soften then add each of the other ingredients in turn until
all are in pot. Add small amounts of wine as necessary, but allow
bottom to become somewhat dry without burning. Remember to keep
STIRRING! Add the garlic last but allow to cook for only about 30
seconds. After all vegetables are in pot, add tomatoes and tomato
paste. It is possible to buy GROUND canned tomatoes, if not, no big
loss. Wash out cans with a quantity of red wine and add to pot. Add
basil, rosemary - ground in spice mill, a little oregano, the
cilantro, chicken base - or bouillon cubes - black pepper and red
pepper, stir cover pot and turn heat down until sauce is barely
boiling. Cook until vegetables are tender and then run through food
mill to puree. Return to pot. Bring barely to boil, adjust
seasonings, cover and heat for about one half hour. Pour over your
spaghetties and mangia! Save some of the red wine to go with the
spaghetties. :
