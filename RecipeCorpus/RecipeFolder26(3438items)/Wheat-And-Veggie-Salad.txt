Title: Wheat And Veggie Salad
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Salad
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Chopped purple onion
x  Fatfree yogurt
x  Balsamic vinegar
x  Sugar
2 c  Cracked wheat or wheat
Berries
2 c  Chopped tomatoes
1 c  Chopped cucumbers
start with 2 cups of cooked cracked wheat.  I just boil it until its
done. Actually I think you are supposed to use boiled wheat berries.
Add an equal amount of chopped tomatoes and half as much chopped
cucumbers and chopped purple onion to taste. For dressing I use
fatfree yogurt with basimaic vinegar and some sugar. Yogurt or sour
cream with dried italian salad dressing would also be good.
