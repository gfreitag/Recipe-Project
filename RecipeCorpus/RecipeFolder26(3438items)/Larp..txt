Title: Larp.
Categories: Ground beef, Vegetable, Thai, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Ground Toasted Rice. **
1 tb Scallion - chopped.
2 tb Lime Juice.
1 ts Salt.
1 tb Fish Sauce.
Fresh Raw Vegetables.
1 lb Fresh Ground Beef.
Mint Leaves.
3    Cloves Garlic.
1 tb Shallot - Chopped.
1 ts Coriander Seeds - Ground.
1 ts Ground Hot Chili Peppers. *
* Adjust the amount of ground hot chili pepper to taste.  Serve extra
on the side to be added to the dish as needed.

** Make toasted rice by browning RAW rice in a hot dry wok or frying
pan, and then ground coarsely in a blender, OR an acceptable
substitute is to brown a commercial "cream of rice" in a hot dry
pan/wok.

Wrap the shallot and garlic in aluminum foil and roast on the stove
for approx. 2 minutes per side till the content is scorched.  Remove
the content from the foil, mash together well (with mortar & pestle,
if available) and set aside.

Lightly cook the ground beef in a dry pan/wok until the pink is just
gone, and place in a bowl.  Let cool for a few minutes.  Add fish
sauce, salt, lime juice, and mix well.  Add the mashed
garlic/shallot, ground coriander seed, toasted rice, ground hot
chili, chopped scallion, and lightly toss together with a fork. Serve
on a bed of lettuce leaves and garnish with mint leaves.

This dish should be served with fresh raw assorted vegetables such as:
chunks of "yard-long bean", nappa leaves (select the more tender inner
leaves), lettuce leaves (Romaine and other leave lettuces are
excellent), celery, and so on.
