Yield: 2 1/2 pints
1 ts Mustard Seed
1    Cinnamon Stick
1 ts Whole Allspice
1    Whole Nutmeg
1 1/2 c  Malt Vinegar
3/4 c  Packed Brown Sugar
1 tb Molasses
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Canola Oil
6 lb Ripe Tomatoes, cored and
Cut in large wedges
12 oz Red Onion, cut in wedges
1/2 c  Parsley Leaves, loosely

In a large heavy nonreactive pot, heat oil. Add tomatoes, onions,
parsley, celery, and carrot. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat. Simmer
slowly, uncovered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool.

Press through a food mill or fine sieve, seperating as much thick
puree as possible. Discard solids and return puree to a clean pot.

Tie mustard, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg in a cheesecloth bag.
Crush spices with a meat mallet. Add to puree along with vinegar,
brown sugar, molasses, and salt. Mix well.

Bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Boil gently 2 to 4 hours until mixture
thickens and is reduced to 4 or 5 cups, stirring frequently. (Cooking
tine will depend on juiciness of tomatoes/ Gradually reduce heat and
stir more frequently as mixture becomes thicker to prevent sticking
and excessive splattering.)

Remove spice bag. Ladle ketchup into 2 or 3 sterilized pint canning
jars. Seal. Cool on rack to room temperature. Store in refrigerator
up to 2 months.
