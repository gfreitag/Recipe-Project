Melt 1 Tbs of butter in a heay 10- to 12-inch skillet set over high
heat. Add the onions, reduce the heat to low and, stirring
occasionally, cook 3 to 5 mins, or until the onions are soft but not
brown. Transfer them to a bowl and cool to room temperature.

Melt the remaining butter in the skillet and pour it into a large
mixing bowl. Add the lukewarm water and, with a large spoon, stir in
the chopped onion, salt and 2 1.2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at a time.
If necessary, beat in as much of the remaining flour as you need to
make a dough that does not stick to your fingers. Gather the dough
into a large, compact ball and divide it into 16 pieces. With the
palms of your hands, shape each piece of dough into 1 1/2- to 2-inch
ball. Then, with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the balls 1
at a time into circles that are about 8 inches in diameter. Set the
rounds of dough aside.

Set a heavy 10- to 12-inch ungreased pan over high heat. When it is
hot enough for a drop of water flicked across its surface to instantly
evaporate, place 1 round of dough in the center. Brown for 3 or 4
mins on each side, turning it over with your fingers or a wide
spatula; do not be concerned if the bread does not brown evenly.

Transfer the bread to a rack to dry and procedd to fry and dry the
remaining dough similarly. Serve the bread in a basket or other porous
container. If for any reason the bread becomes limp after a day or so,
place the rounds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and bake them
for 5 to 10 mins in a preheated 250Â° oven until they freshen.
