Title: Florida Keys Black Bean Dip
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Dip
Yield: 1 servings
1 T  Orange juice
1    Clove garlic
1    16-0z can black beans
2 T  Chopped red onion
2 T  Balsamic vinegar
(Please measure carefully. I overdid the oj and onions once--and
regretted it.)

Combine ingredients in the blender/processor and whir til smooth.
Serve with thin slices of chayote squash.

I also like to garnish the dip with orange zest and cilantro and
served it with tortillas.

Comment: This is the same recipe I use for just plain black beans.
They are delicious served without putting this in the blender. Happy
eating. Barbara Z.
