Title: Jerusalem Artichokes W/ Green Onions
Categories: Vegetable, Tomato, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Fresh tomato, seeded and
Diced
1 lb Jerusalem artichokes
2    Bunches green onions
3 tb Butter or margarine
3/4 c  Water
1. Pare the artichokes. Drop into pan of cold water as each is
finished. Rinse, pat dry, and cut into 1/4-inch slices. 2. Trim
roots and wilted tips from green onions. Wash and dry. Cut
onions into halves, then into 4-inch lengths. 3. Heat butter in
saute pan. Add onions, turn to coat with butter.
Add 1/4 cup of the water. Turn heat to medium and simmer until
liquid is
evaporated, about 10 min. 4. Add sliced artichokes, salt, pepper
and the remaining 1/2 cup
water. 5. Simmer at medium heat until water is evaporated or until
artichokes are tender, about 20 min. They should be tender, but
still
have a bit of texture. If necessary, add 2 to 3 Tbsp. water. 6. Add
tomato to pan. Toss and heat through. Turn into serving dish or
arrange around a platter of meat.

TIPS: You may pare artichokes ahead of time, even the day before, but
hold them in cold water to keep them from discoloring. Much of
the preparation time allows for this chore. Also, if desired,
may use 4 large leeks in place of the green onions. For 2
use half of the ingredients. For 8 servings, double the
ingredients.
