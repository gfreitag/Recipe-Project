NOTES : Since the earliest times a beet soup, barszcz, has been
served in
Poland for everyday and company meals. It is traditional for
both
Christmas and Easter dinners, and it is served cold for the
harvest festival. There are innumerable varieties if barszcz,
which can be made with vegetable or meat broth and can be
either
clear or include several ingredients. The foundation for the
true
barszcz, however, is a tart ferment called kwas, which is made
from sour rye bread and beets. Kwas is not generally available
in
America. The following clear barszcz may contain cooked
potatoes,
sliced sausages, cooked meat or filled pastries, and if desired
may be garnished with sour cream.
