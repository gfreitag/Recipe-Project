Title: Zucchini And Hominy Soup
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Peeled and chopped mild
Green chile peppers
6 c  Vegetable broth
2 T  Apple juice
1    Onion, diced
3    Cloves garlic, minced
4    Zucchini, sliced
4 cups cooked yellow hominy (or 2 16-oz. cans) 1 teaspoon ground
cumin 2 Tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro

Saute the onion and garlic in apple juice for 3-5 minutes.  Add

This is a vegetarian version of posole, a dish made by Pueblos and
Hispanics for feast days and special celebrations.  Serve it with sage
breadsticks.  Hominy is a flavorful, chewy type of corn kernel that is
treated with lime and dried. It is available either canned, frozen, or
dried. A mail-order source for hominy is Los Chileros de Nuevo
Mexico, PO Box 6215, Santa Fe, NM 87502; (505) 471-6967. You can
substitute frozen corn kernels for an even more colorful soup.
