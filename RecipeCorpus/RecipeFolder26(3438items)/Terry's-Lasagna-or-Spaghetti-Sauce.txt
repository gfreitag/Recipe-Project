teaspoon of sugar can be added.

Note: I use double grated cheese (it has the cheddar and mozzarella
already mixed).
Lasagna

Cook Lasagna as per instructions on the box. Alternate layers of
lasagna noodles with meat sauce, cheddar cheese, and mozzarella
cheese until desired thickness. Bake at 400 deg F for 1 to 1 and 1/2
hours or until cheese is melted.

Optional: Top can be sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese before baking.
