Title: Basic Fondant
Categories: Candy, Information
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------------YIELD: 3 POUNDS---------------------------
3/4 ea Pt water
3 lb Granulated sugar
2 oz Powdered glucose
Put the sugar, water and gllucose in a saucepan and dissolve the
sugar and glucose over a low heat, stirring all the time. When the
sugar is completely dissolved, bring the syrup slowly to a boil. Boil
to 240, without stirring. Remove from the heat and leave until all
the bubbles have disappeared from the surface. Sprinkle a little
water on a baking sheet and pour the syrup onto it. As the syrup
touches the cold, damp surface, it wil start to thicken. Leave to
cool until a skin starts to form around the edges. Using a wooden
spatula, collect the edges into the center and work the mixture in a
figure eight movement. It will gradually shrink into a hard,
crystaline white lump. Once this is achieved, scrape the fondant off
the sheet and knead with your hands until smooth and even textured,
soft and pliable. If possible, the fondant should be left for 2-3
days before use; in fact, it will keep for up to 6 weeks if
necessary-which is why it is worth making a large quantity at once.
Put the fondant in a polythene container with an airtight lid, cover
the surface closely with clingfilm and seal the lid on tightly. The
clingfilm prevents the surface from srying out-if the surface does
harden, it wil spoill the fondant. In hot weather, keep the fondant
in the refrigerator. When you take out part of the fondant for use,
be sure to press the clingfilm down over the surface again to keep
out the air, and to reseal the box tightly. Harrods Book of
