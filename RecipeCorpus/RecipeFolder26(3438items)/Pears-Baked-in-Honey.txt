Title: Pears Baked in Honey
Categories: Dessert, Fruit, British
Yield: 12 servings
1    Lemon, juice
20 fl Water (plus)
12    Pears
1 lb Honey
Preheat oven to 325 F (160 C). Peel halve and core the pears, keeping
them in water which you have acidulated with half the lemon juice.
Dissolve the honey in the water, add the other half of the lemon
juice and bring to the boil. Transfer to an oven proof dish or pan
large enough to keep the pear halves in one layer.

Add the drained pear halves and bring back to the boil. Immediately
transfer the dish to the oven and poach until the pears are really
tender. Remove with slotted spoon, boil down cooking liquor to a
syrup and pour over the pears. Leave to cool then chill. Serve with
the thickest cream you can find.
