In the United States alone, 3.6 cans are consumed every second
(assuming Spam is eaten night and day, 365 days a year.) There is
even "I'm a Spam Fan", a book by Carolyn Wyman, a journalist from
Middletown, CT. What is it exactly? Spam - Ground pork shoulder and
ham fused with salt, sugar, water and sodium nitrate and stuffed into
a can and sealed, dried, dated and shipped is popular for it's
versatility. You can slice it, dice it, fry it, eat it raw, bake it
or broil it. You can have it low-salt, smoke-flavored, traditional,
or with processed American cheese chunks imbedded in its congealed
matter. It needs no refrigeration and keeps to the end of time. That
is why it's the all-time favorite choice for bomb-shelter and
storm-cellar cuisine. Early canned ham was promoted as a health food
after it's 1937 introduction by the George A. Hormel Company, reports
"The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste" by Jane and Michael Stern. Spam
according to "Bad Taste" was the ultimate war baby: After World War
II, Nikita Krushchev credited Allied troops for saving thousands of
lives with the gifts of countless cases of Spam to the starving
Russian army. At the same time in England, many families ate nothing
but Spam for weeks while meat was rationed. In Hawaii, meal preparers
took such a liking to the canned meat matter during World War II that
islanders still eat an approximate four cans per person per year -
more than any other people on the globe. SOURCE:*Ocala Star-Banner,
