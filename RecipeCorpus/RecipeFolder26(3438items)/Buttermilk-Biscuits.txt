Title: Buttermilk Biscuits
Categories: Bread
Yield: 12 servings
3/4 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Self-rising flour
2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
Recipe by: Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle Stop Cafe Cookbook Combine
first 3 ingredients in a bowl and make a well in center. Combine
buttermilk and oil; add all at once to dry ingredients and stir until
dough is moist but not sticky. Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Turn dough out
onto a lightly floured surface and knead lightly 4 or 5 times. Roll
dough to 1/2-inch thickness; cut with a 2-inch biscuit cutter. Knead
scraps 2 or 3 times and cut as before. Place on a lightly greased
baking sheet and bake for 10 mins, or until lightly browned. Brush
with melted margarine if desired. YIELD: about 1 dozen

NOTE: Biscuit dough may be wrapped and refrigerated up to 3 days
before shaping and baking.

NOTES : For a crustier biscuit, place the rounds one inch apart on
baking
sheet. This allows the biscuits to brown slightly all the way
around. If you like soft edges, place them close together on
baking sheet.
