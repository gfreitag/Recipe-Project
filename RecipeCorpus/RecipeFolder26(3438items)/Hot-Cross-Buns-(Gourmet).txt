Hot cross buns date back to the 1300s in England. They were served on
Good Friday and passed out to those journeying a distance to attend
services. A light and spicy contemporary version of this legendary
bread is a fitting conclusion to this Easter sampler. In a small bowl
proof 1 envelope active dry yeast in 1/4 cup lukewarm water with 1
teaspoon sugar for 10 minutes. In a large bowl combine 1/2 stick or
1/4 cup butter, softened and cut into bits, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon
cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir 1 cup scalded milk into the
butter mixture and let the mixture cool until it is lukewarm. Add the
yeast mixture and 2 eggs, lightly beaten. Gradually beat in 3 1/2 to
4 cups flour, or enough to make a soft dough, and incorporate 1/2 cup
currants. Butter the top of the dough lightly and let the dough rise,
covered, in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double in
bulk. Punch down the dough and cut off pieces large enough to shape
into balls about 2 inches in diameter. Arrange the balls on a
buttered baking sheet so that they touch one another and let them
rise, covered, in a warm place for about 45 minutes, or until they
are double in bulk. With the blunt edge of a knife, mark each bun
with a cross and brush the buns with an egg white, lightly beaten.
Bake the buns in a preheated moderate oven (350-F.) for 20 to 25
minutes, or until they are golden, and transfer them to a rack. In a
small bowl combine 1 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted, 1 1/2
tablespoons milk, and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and drizzle the glaze over
the buns, forming a cross, while they are still warm.
