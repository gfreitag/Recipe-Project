Title: Italian-Style Hot Cocoa
Categories: Fatfree, Beverage, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Cocoa powder
1/3 c  White sugar
Mix in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Once this
mixture comes to a boil, add 2 cups of liquid (water, brewed coffee,
skim milk; the author recommended a cup of water and skim milk each)
and stir over heat until heated through and mixed.

This produces a thick, quite rich brew, not for children, but highly
chocolate-concentrated.  Clearly, it's pretty much just empty
calories, but not that much of them, and the fat is only what comes
in your cocoa. Of course, the New Yorker article claimed that the
flavor varies greatly with the brand of cocoa powder that you use--he
recommended some Italian varieties that I've been unable to find--but
he found that basic Hershey's was more than adequate.
