MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Arrange the spareribs in a single layer of a large non-reactive dish
(glass, stainless steel).  Whisk together all the ingredients through
the rosemary in a medium-size bowl, and pour this over the spareribs.
Turn the ribs so they are moistened on all sides, cover, and
refrigerate for at least 24 hours, turning them several times so they
are evenly marinated. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or
build a good-sized fire in a barbecue. Drain the spareribs, reserving
the marinade. Place them in a non-reactive baking pan in one layer
(use two baking pans if necessary), and bake in the center of the
oven, basting frequently, until they are golden, crisp, and cooked
through, 55 minutes to 1 hour.  Turn them occasionally to make sure
they cook evenly. If you are using a charcoal grill, spread the coals
out when they are red and dusted with ash. Lightly oil the grill
rack, and place it about 3 inches above the coals. Cook the ribs,
basting and turning them, 55 minutes to 1 hour. To serve the
spareribs, drain off the fat and transfer them to a warmed shallow
serving bowl or platter.  Garnish with the lime wedges, and provide
plenty of napkins.
