Title: Melt-Away Butter Cakes
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Grated lemon rind
1 ts Lemon extract
2 1/2 c  Sifted unbleached flour
1 c  Softened butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg, beaten
1/4 ts Salt
Cream the butter with the sugar.  Add all but 1 T of the egg, salt
lemon rind and extract.  Work in the sifted flour a few tablespoons
at a time until thoroughly blended.  Turn dough out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead for just a few minutes. Pat dough out flat
in an 8 inch round greased baking pan.  Brush with reserved
tablespoon of beaten egg. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes or
until golden. Allow cake to cool 30 minutes. Remove from pan and cut
into serving pieces. Cake will harden as it cools.  Store in airtight
container. Keeps well for a long time. Variation:  Substitute 1/2 t
ground ginger & 2 T minced crystalized ginger for lemon extract &
rind. From "The Portable Feast" by Diane D. MacMillan, 101
