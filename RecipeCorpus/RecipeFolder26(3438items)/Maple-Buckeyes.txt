Title: Maple Buckeyes
Categories: Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
12 oz Chocolate Chips
1 sl Cake Paraffin
1/4 c  Butter
1/4 c  Peanut Butter; chunky
1 pt Maple Syrup
Cook butter and maple syrup to 232 degrees.  Just before removing from
stove add peanut butter without stirring. When cool, beat with mixer
til graining starts. Finish by hand--shape into balls the size of a
buckeye. Dip balls into chocolate bits and paraffin melted over hot
water. Using a toothpick in the center of the ball, dip a little more
than halfway into the chocolate to resemble a buckeye. Drain on wax
paper. Later, depress the top of buckeye and cover the toothpick
hole. Makes about 1 lb.
