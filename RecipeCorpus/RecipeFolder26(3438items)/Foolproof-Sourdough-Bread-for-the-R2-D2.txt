Title: Foolproof Sourdough Bread for the R2 D2
Categories: Bread, Sourdough, Breadmaker
Yield: 24 servings
MMMMM-----------------------ADD TO STARTER----------------------------
1 1/4 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------POUR INTO BREADMAKER-------------------------
1/2 tb Salt
2 tb Oil
2 c  Sourdough starter
1/2 tb Yeast
2 1/4 c  Flour, bread
1 tb Sugar
The starter can be any starter that has been fed with equal amounts of
flour and liquid, as long as you are not "pouring off" the clear
residue that rises to the top before you stir it.

Several hours before starting the bread, remove starter from
refrigerator and add flour and water.  Stir well and allow to sit.
Milk or potato water may be substituted for the water.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock.  Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot humid weather, use 1/4 c less starter.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comment: top falls occasionally,
otherwise great!
