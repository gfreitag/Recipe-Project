Combine milk and egg in a bowl; mix with a whisk or fork. Stir in
flour and salt and mix again. Heat a lightly greased 7-inch or 8-inch
skillet and spoon 3 Tbs of batter into it. (Pour the batter all at
once from a small glass.) Tip pan quickly at once to spread batter
evenly. Cook until underside is done and bubbles form on top. Turn
over with a spatula and cook on the other side. Slip onto a warm
plate and keep warm in a preheated 250Â° F. oven while cooking the
other pancakes. When all pancakes are cooked, put a large spoonful of
the Mushroom Filling lengthwise along each one; roll up. Serve at
once topped with a spoonful of sour cream. Serves 10 to 12.

MUSHROOM FILLING:

Clean mushrooms by rinsing quickly or wiping with wet paper toweling.
Saute green onions in butter until tender. Add mushroom slices; saute
4 mins. Stir in remaining ingredients and leave on stove long enough
to heat through.

NOTES : Some of the most inviting Polish creations are the delctable
pancakes, or nalesniki. They can be filled with savory meat,
cheese or mushroom combinations and eaten as entrees. Other
pancakes are filled with sweet mixtures such as cheese, sour
cream
and sugar, jam or preserves, and eaten as desserts. These
pancakes
may be spread with any sweet filling, folded over and fried in
butter, if desired.
