Recipe by: Jackie Passmore Soak the noodles in hot water for at least
12 minutes to soften, then drain well. Combine the sugar, fish sauce,
ketchup, and chili sauce in a small bowl.

Prepare the garnish ingredients.  Place the dried shrimp in a blender
or spice grinder and grind until finely shredded.  Arrange the
garnishes on a plate to serve with the noodles.

Fry the garlic in the oil over medium heat until very aromatic, about
1 minute.  Add the shrimp and fry for 40 seconds.  Pour in the sauce
mixture and cook briefly, then add the noodles and toss until
thoroughly coated with the sauce.  Add half the bean sprouts and
cook, continuously tossing and stirring, until the bean sprouts have
softened.

Transfer to a platter, scattering the remaining bean sprouts over the
top.
Serve with the platter of garnishes, allowing guests to add what they
want, to taste.
