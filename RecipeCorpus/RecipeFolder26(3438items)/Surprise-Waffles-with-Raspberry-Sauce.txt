Puree raspberries in blender or food processor.  Pour through a fine
strainer into a small saucepan. Mix together cornstarch and water.
Add to raspberries, along with sugar.  Stir over medium heat until
boiling, slightly thickened and transparent. Remove from heat. Makes
1 cup. WAFFLES: Beat eggs, sour cream, and milk in medium-size bowl
with wire whisk or fork until smooth.  Add flour, baking powder,
baking soda, salt, and vanilla; beat until just smooth. Stir in
butter until blended. Pour batter onto waffle iron, preferably with
nonstick coating. (You'll need a scant 3/4 cup for an 8-inch waffle.)
Sprinkle about 1 Tbsp chocolate chips over each waffle before baking
to a golden brown. Cool waffles on racks. Meanwhile gently reheat
Raspberry Sauce. Cut waffles in quarters. For each serving, stack 5
quarters with whipped cream between layers. Top with a dollop of
whipped cream and warm sauce. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.
