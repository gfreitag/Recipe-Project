x  Oranges
x  Yams
x  Salt
I a dish safe for baking, alternate slices of yam with slices of
oranges in this way //////. Pour some orange juice on. May want to
spice with a little salt and cinnamon, sugar for those who like it
sweet. Bake at medium heat until done.

I know, this is not much of a recipe, but it always turns out great,
and I never make it exactly the same twice.

You can also put one layer of orange, then one layer of yam, and so
on, until the dish is full.
