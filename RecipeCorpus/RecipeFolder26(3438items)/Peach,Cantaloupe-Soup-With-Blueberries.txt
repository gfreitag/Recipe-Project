Title: Peach/Cantaloupe Soup With Blueberries
Categories: Fatfree, Soup/stew, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1/2 lg Cantaloupe
6    Fresh peaches
1 c  Orange juice
Peel and slice peaches.  Simmer in orange juice with nutmeg (cinnamon
might be good too).  Puree, adding also as you puree: 1/2 large
cantaloupe.

Taste the resulting 'soup'.  Thin with orange juice if it seems too
thick, add a touch of honey or sugar if your fruit wasn't sweet
enough for your taste.   Chill.

Serve garnished with handfuls of fresh blueberries.
