Measure out 2 cups of nut meats (walnuts, black walnuts, hickory
nuts, pecans, etc.), place in a saucepan, and warm the nut meats
slightly. Combine 1 cup sugar with 1/2 cup water cook, stirring
constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking until syrup
reaches 238Â°F or until a little syrup, dropped into cold water, forms
a soft ball which flattens when taken out of the water. Remove from
heat and pour very slowly over the warm nuts, shaking the nuts back
and forth vigorously. The intended result is a relatively even
coating of sugar over all the nuts.
