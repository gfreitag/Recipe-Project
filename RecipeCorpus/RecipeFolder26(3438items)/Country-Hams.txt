It is the custom in some parts of the U.S. to hang hams, after special
processing, for several years, after which time, of course, they
develop a heavy exterior mold.

To prepare one of these old hams, soak it in cold water to cover for
24 to 36 hours.  Then scrub it well, using a brush and yellow soap,
if necessary, to remove the mold.  Rinse thoroughly and place in a
kettle of simmering water, skin side down.  Allow 20 minutes to the
pound until the meat reaches an internal heat of 150ø.  Add to the
water before last 1/4 of cooking time:  cider and 1/4 cup of brown
sugar.

Drain when the cooking time has elapsed.  Remove the skin while the
ham is still warm, being careful not to tear the fat.  Trim the fat
partially. Dust the ham with a mixture of black pepper, corn meal,
and brown sugar.

Put in a 425ø oven long enough to glaze it.  If you want more of a
baked quality allow the ham to reach an internal heat of 160ø to
165ø. Serve hot or cold.  Be sure to slice very, very thin.
