Prepare the Tomato-Tequila Vinaigrette and set aside.

Rub the salmon fillets with the chile powder. Heat the olive oil in a
frying pan (pref nonstick) over medium-high heat, add the fillets
without crowding and sear 3 to 4 minutes per side, depending on the
desired degree of doneness.

To serve, place the salmon fillets on four plates, stir the
vinaigrette and pour it over the fillets.

Blackened Tomato-Tequila Vinaigrette:

To blacken the tomatoes, preheat a heavy skillet (pref cast-iron)
over high heat. Add the whole tomatoes and cook, turning
occasionally, until the tomato skins split and are blackened, about 5
minutes. Remove and let cool. Peel the tomatoes, discard the stem
ends and coarsely chop the tomatoes.

Combine the tomatoes, chile, onion, garlic, tequila, salt and pepper
in a nonreactive saucepan and simmer over medium-high heat for 10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour the contents into a blender or
food processor and blend 1 minute. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve
into a bowl. Add the vinegar and olive oil and mix well. Taste for
seasoning.

Makes about 3/4 cup.
