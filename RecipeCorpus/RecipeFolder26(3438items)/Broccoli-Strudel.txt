2 c  Grated cheddar (opt)
2 tb Lemon juice (more to taste)
10 ea Sheets of filo pastry
3 tb To 4T olive oil for filo
1 tb Butter or olive oil
1 c  Minced onion
1 lg Brunch broccoli, finely chop
1/2 ts Salt
Lots of black pepper
2 md Cloves garlic, minced
1.  Preheat oven to 375.  Oil a baking tray.

2.  Melt butter or heat 1T olive oil in a large skillet.  Add onion,
and saute for about 5 mins over medium heat.

3.  Add broccoli, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring for about 5 mor
minutes.  Add garlic, and saute until the broccoli is just tender
<about 5 more minutes>.  Remove from heat.

4.  Stir in bread crumbs, cheese, and lemon juice.  Taste to adjust
seasoning.

5.  To assemble:  Place on sheet of filo on a clean, dry countertop.
Brush the top lightly with oil, then add another sheet.  Brush with
oil, then add another.  Continue until you have a pile of five
leaves.  Add half the filling, fold in the sides, and gently roll
until you have a nice neat little log.  Brush the top with more oil,
then carefully lift the pastry, and place it on the oiled baking
sheet.  Repeat this proceedure to make a second roll, and place it
next to the first one on the tray.

6.  Bake 25-30 mins, until golden and exquisitely crisp.  Cut with a
serrated knife, using a gentle sawing motion.  Serve hot or at room
temperature.
