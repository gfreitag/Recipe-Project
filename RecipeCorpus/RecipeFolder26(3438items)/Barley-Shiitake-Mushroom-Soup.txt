Title: Barley-Shiitake Mushroom Soup
Categories: Fatfree, Mushroom, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
8 c  Water
2 T  Michelle's Chicken Style
Seasoning
1 t  Salt or to taste
1 1/2 c  Dry shiitake mushrooms
2 lg Yellow onions
6    Stalks celery
6    Carrots
1 pk Quaker Quick Barley
Rinse the shiitake mushrooms and set them aside to soak in plenty of
water. They will need about an hour to soak.  Chop the onions,
celery, and carrots. Put the vegetables and Michelle's seasoning in a
large stock pot with the water. When the mushrooms are soft, snip
them into smaller pieces (approx. a square inch each) and drop them
in the pot. Bring the pot to a boil, turn down to simmer. Cook until
the carrots just start to soften. Add barley and simmer for another
10-15 minutes. Taste the broth occasionally while cooking, add salt
to taste and more of Michelle's seasoning if needed.
