Title: Savory Vegetable Soup (Vegan)
Categories: Vegetarian, Fatfree, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
5    Carrots, cut into large
Chunks
1    Quarter head of fresh, green
Cabbage, cut into big
Chunks
1 cn Green beans
1 cn Lima beans
1 cn Corn
1    Bay leaf
2    Cubes (b**f) or vegetable
Bullion
x  Enough water to cover
Veggies by about 2 inches
x  Seasoning to taste
1 lg Can of tomatoes (whole or
Chopped)
1 cn Tomato paste
1    6 oz can of V8 (I like the
Spicy kind)
3 lg Potatoes, peeled and cut
Into large chunks
4    Celery stalks, chopped into
lg Chunks
1 lg Onion, chopped into large
Chunks
1 c  Or more large, fresh,
Cleaned mushrooms (left
Whole)
Add all ingredients to a large kettle, squeezing or cubing whole
tomatoes, so that their juices become part of the mixture. Cover and
let simmer for several hours, adding water as necessary, until the
veggies are fully cooked and the flavors have had the chance to mix.
(This soup is really better the second day.) I have not included can
sizes, since how much (or what you add) really depends on your
personal taste. (Hominy, for instance, is something I sometimes add,
and is really good!) This recipe has no fat and is delicious!! Enjoy!
