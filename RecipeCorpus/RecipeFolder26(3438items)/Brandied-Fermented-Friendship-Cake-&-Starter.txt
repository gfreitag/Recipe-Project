STARTER: In a gallon jar combine pineapple, 1 cup sugar and 2
Tablespoons brandy. Let ingredients sit in jar for 2 weeks, stirring
daily. At the end of 2 weeks, add maraschino cherries, 1 cup sugar
and 2 Tablespoons brandy. Let all ingredients sit in jar for 2 weeks,
stirring daily. At the end of second 2 week period, add peaches, 1
cup sugar and 2 Tablespoons brandy. Let sit in jar for another 2
weeks, stirring daily.  At end of third 2 week period, separate the
liquid from the fruit.  The liquid is your starter, and you can use
the fruit on ice cream or cake.Now you are ready to prepare the fruit
for 2 cakes. DO NOT REFRIGERATE THE LIQUID.  In a large gallon jar,
place 1-1/2 cups of the starter, 2-1/2 cups of sugar and 28 oz can of
sliced peaches.  Mix well and cover jar with a paper towel. Do not
refrigerate or screw a lid on the jar.  Stir every day for 10 days.
Next, add 2-1/2 cups of sugar and 16 oz can of crushed pineapple.Stir
every day for 10 days. Add 2-1/2 cups sugar and 16 oz can of fruit
cocktail. Slice contents of 10 oz jar of maraschino cherries and add.
Stir every day for 10 days. On baking day, drain the fruit and divide
it into 2 equal parts. Save the juice and use it for starter (you
will have enough for 5 starters approx 2 cups each). DO NOT
REFRIGERATE THE LIQUID, it will stop the fermenting action. CAKE; To
each cake mix, add pudding mix, oil and eggs. Beat until smooth and
fold in fruit and nuts. Batter will be thick. Pour mixture into a
greased tube pan and bake at 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes.  Turn
cake out of pan while hot. When cooled, the cake freezes well.  The
choices of flavored cake mixes and pudding mixes is yours, and
coconut may be substituted for the nuts. Submitted By DOROTHY FLATMAN
