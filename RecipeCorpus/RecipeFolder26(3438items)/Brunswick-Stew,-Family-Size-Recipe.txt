Place the chicken, celery and small onion in a large kettle and add
about a quart of water.  Simmer until the meat is tender and begins
to loosen from the bones, Lift the chicken from the broth.  Cool the
broth and discard the celery.  Remove the meat from the bones and cut
it into small pieces.

Add the tomatoes, chopped onions and whole potatoes to the broth.
Continue cooking over medium heat.  Remove the potatoes when they are
tender, mash and return to the stew.  (Some cooks omit this step but
dice the potatoes before adding them to the stew.  It has been noted,
however that the stew freezes better when the potatoes have been
mashed; otherwise they will become soggy.)

Add the cut-up chicken, butter beans, corn and sugar.  Add salt and
red and black pepper to taste.

Bring to a boil while stirring.  Cover, lower the heat and simmer
slowly, stirring occasionally to prevent stickiing, for 3 to 5 hours,
or until the tomatoes have been cooked to pieces.

Makes 12 servings.
