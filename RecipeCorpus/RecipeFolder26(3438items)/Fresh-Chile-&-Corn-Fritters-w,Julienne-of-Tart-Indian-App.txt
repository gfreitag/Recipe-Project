1 ts Salt
1/2 ts White pepper
3 tb All purpose flour
3/4 c  Clarified butter
4    Green anaheim chiles
3 c  Corn kernels, scraped from

6 sm Green apples, cored and
Roast the anaheim chiles, then peel, seed and dice them.

Process the corn in a food processor until it resembles a puree,
about 2 minutes.  Scrape down with a spatula and process for another
minute.

In a bowl, mix together the corn puree,the chopeed chiles, salt, and
pepper.  Slowly add the flour, small amounts at a time, while
stirring.

In a medium saucepan, heat the clarified butter over high heat. Using
a large cook's spoon or serving spoon, gently drop spoonfuls of the
batter into the hot butter.  When the edges are brown after about 2
minutes, turn the fritters over and cook another 2 minutes.  Remove
the fritters and allow them to drain on paper towels.

In another saucepan over medium high heat, melt the unsalted butter,
add the apples and the celery seed, and saute about 3 minutes, until
they begin to soften.  Serve hot with the fritters.

*** NOTE *** To make clarified butter, melt butter over low heat,
then set aside to cool. When the milk solids have separated fro mthe
liquid, skim the top layer of froth from the butter with a spoon and
discard. Pour off the clarified butter, discarding the residue on the
bottom. ***********************
