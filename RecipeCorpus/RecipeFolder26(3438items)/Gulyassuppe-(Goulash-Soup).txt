beef and stir around well in onion and paprika mixture.  Let meat
sear and brown very slightly.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and
vinegar and stir in tomato paste.  Simmer 3 or 4 minutes, then add
caraway seeds, marjoram, garlic and water.  Bring to boiling point,

NOTE:  This is the favorite midnight snack of the Bavarians.  It is
served
in bowls or in individual pewter casserole-porringers in the
crowded Munich beer halls.  It is also a favorite in the beer
halls
Stuttgart (less the caraway seeds).  To be at its best, this
soup
should be made the day before you intend to serve it.
