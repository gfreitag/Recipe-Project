room temperature for 1 hour.  Heat oil until very hot and sear steaks
on both sides to seal the juices; reduce heat and cook slowly until
done. Remove steaks from pan, saute bread in the drippings and set
aside. Add water to the pan and stir until all brown bits are
dissolved. Add cream. Top bread slices with steak and place on heated
serving platter. Heat brandy, ignite and pour over steaks. Serve
cream sauce separately.
