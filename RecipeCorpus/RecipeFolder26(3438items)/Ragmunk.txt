Grate 8 medium sized raw potatoes and cover with cold water.  Let them
stand for 5 minutes and drain thoroughly by squeezing the gratings in
a towel.  Measure the amount of raw potato pulp, add an equal amount
of cold meat stock, 2 large eggs, 1 cup flour, and salt and pepper to
taste, and blend the mixture thoroughly by beating it vigorously.
Add another up of flour in small amounts, beating after each
addition, until the mixture reaches pancake batter thickness.  Ladle
enough of the batter to make a medium-sized pancake onto a griddle
generously greased with bacon drippings.  Bake to a crisp brown on
both sides. From: The Gourmet Cookbook Shared By: Pat Stockett
