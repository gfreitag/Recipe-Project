To make a good white milk gravy you've gotta have a good eye for
measurments.  After you fry  your chicken or steak, look at the
drippins in the pan and try to decide how much flour and milk you
need to thicken it up without getting too much.  If you have just
fried a good sized chicken, or several pieces of steak, and you've
got a fair amount of drippins in the skillet, then you'll probably
use 2 Tablespoons of flour with about 1/4 cup of milk.  Mix it in
until there're no more lumps and then add it to the drippins and stir
over a low flame until thick. If you get your gravy too thick, just
water it down some; if it's too thin, add some more flour. Always
keep reminding yourself that it takes years of practice to make a
good flour gravy.  Nobody's perfect right at the very first.
