Bread; thickly sliced
(e.g. sourdough; italian
And pumpernickle)>
Place bead cubes in a large bowl, add oil, and other ingredients. Toss
untiloil is absorbed.  Place on a cookie sheet or tin foil and bake
in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees for approximately 25 mintues until
browned.Turn once or twice so that all sides brown evenly. I don't
bother with the seasoning of my croutons for my Caesar salad since
the dressing tends to overpower their flavoring. Store in an airtight
container! Well, that's it! Whew! Now I'm too pooped from all this
typing to cook the veal tonight.  Guess I'll make a salad and some
warm homemade bread! Chez Chuck MM Format Norma Wrenn npxr56b
