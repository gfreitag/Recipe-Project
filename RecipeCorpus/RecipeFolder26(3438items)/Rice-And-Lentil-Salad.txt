Title: Rice And Lentil Salad
Categories: Fatfree, Rice, Beans, Vegetable, Salad
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Green (French) lentils
1 c  Wild rice
1 c  Long grain brown rice
MMMMM------------------------COMBINE WITH-----------------------------
1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil (more or
Less)
1    To 2 tablespoon or chopped
Fresh mint
1 ea Red, yellow, green bell
Pepper, chopped
2 c  Small cherry tomatoes
1    Or 2 carrots
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
x  Red wine vinegar
x  Nonfat tomato-herb
Cook grains separately, in 2 cups water, until done, 45 minutes or
less.

For the dressing, I used a prepared nonfat tomato-herb dressing
(Trader Joe's) mixed about half and half with red wine vinegar
because I generally find prepared nonfat dressings too thick and too
sweet for my taste. I didn't measure, but I used perhaps half a cup,
maybe as much as a cup, total, just enough to moisten everything.

I let it sit in the refrigerator all day, to let the flavors mix. I
don't know how many people it served--it filled a large bowl-- but
there wasn't any left over after the potluck (and while I was glad
that everyone liked it, I was sorry not to have some to take home).
