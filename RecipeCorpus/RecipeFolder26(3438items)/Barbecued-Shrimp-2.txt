Title: Barbecued Shrimp 2
Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Bbq/grill, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 2 servings
1/8 t  Dried oregano leaves
(MAIN INGREDIENTS):
1/4 lb + 5 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 t  Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 t  Minced garlic
1/2 c  Basic shrimp stock
1/4 c  Beer at room temperature
(SEASONING-MIX):
1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
1 t  Black pepper
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Crushed red pepper
1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
1/2 t  Dried rosemary leaves, crush
Rinse the shrimp in cold water and drain well.  Then pinch off and
discard the portion of the head from the eyes forward (including the
eyes, but not the protruding long spine above the eyes).  Leave as
much as possible of the orange shrimp fat from the head attached to
the body. Set aside.

In a small bowl combine the seasoning mix ingredients. combine 1
stick of the butter, the garlic, Worcestershire and seasoning mix in
a large skillet over high heat. When the butter is melted, add the
shrimp. Cook for 2 minutes, shaking the pan (versus stirring) in a
back-and-forth motion. Add the remaining 5 tablespoons butter and the
stock; cook and shake pan for 2 minutes.  Add the beer and cook and
shake the pan 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat.

Serve immediately in bowls with lots of French bread on the side, or
on a platter with cooked rice mounded in the middle and the shrimp
and sauce surrounding it.

LAGNIAPPE:  A certain percentage of oil is released when butter is
melted, shaking the pan in a back-and-forth motion and the addition
of stock to the butter keep the sauce from separating and having an
oily texture--stirring doesn't produce the same effect.
