MMMMM--------------------------BREADING-------------------------------
2 1/2 c  Fresh or dried bread crumbs
Oil for deep frying
6 tb Flour
2    Eggs, beaten
MMMMM-------------------ONION AND EGG TOPPING------------------------
3 tb Dark soy sauce
4    Green onions, cut into 1 1/2
-inch lengths
6    Eggs, beaten
1 sm Onion
2 1/2 c  Dashi
7 tb Mirin
3 tb Light soy sauce
Pound cutlets with a mallet or bottle to flatten slightly.  Slash fat
at edges to keep the meet from curling during deep frying.  Salt and
pepper both sides.

Dust with flour, dip in beaten egg, and coat both sides thickly with
dry or fresh bread crumbs.  Let rest 2 or 3 minutes before deep
frying.

Heat a generous amound of oil in a heavy bottomed pot or deep fryer to
medium temperature (340 degrees F.), and deep fry cutlets one at a
time, turning once until golden brown, about 6 minutes total for each
cutlet. Remove, drain on absorbent paper, and cut crosswise into 1/2
inch slices. Keep hot.

Meanwhile, slice onions into rounds or half-moons and, in a large
frying pan in a scant amount of oil, saute onion over high heat until
transparent and soft.  Add the dash, mirin, and soy sauces to the
pan.  Bring to a simmer.  Add the green onion lengths.

Finally, pour the beaten egg over the simmering onions.  Stir when the
eggs begin to set.  The egg is done while still a little runny and
juicy. (Do not cook egg until hard and dry!).  You want the juices to
seep down into the rice in the bowl from the egg topping.

Put a single portion of hot rice, 1 1/2 to 2 cups into a donburi-type
bowl.  Neatly arrange a sliced cutlet to cover half the rice.  Use the
fried onion-and-egg "topping" to gover part of the cutlet and the
rest of the rice.  Use all the liquid.  Serve immediately.
