Title: Taramosalata (Carp Roe Spread)
Categories: Middle east, Greek, Spread, Dip, Fish
Yield: 2 cups
;carp roe)
1/4 c  Lemon juice, fresh
1/4 c  Onion; finely grated
1 c  Olive oil
6 sl White bread; homemade type,
;trimmed of crusts
1 c  Cold water
1/2 c  Tarama; (4 ozs.), (salted
Soak the bread in the water for 5 minutes, then vigorously squeeze
it dry with your hands.  With a large mortar and pestle or the back
of a spoon, mash the bread until smooth.  Then add the tarama, 1
teaspoon at a time, mashing and stirring constantly.  Beat in the
lemon juice and the grated onion and continue mashing until the
mixture becomes a smooth paste.
Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and, with a whisk or a rotary
or electric beater, beat in the oil, 1 tablespoon at a time; make
sure each tablespoon is absorbed before adding more.  When about 1/2
cup of oil has been beaten in, the mixture should be creamy and
smooth. Pour in more oil in a slow, thin stream, beating constantly
until the taramosalata is thick enough to hold its shape almost
solidly in a spoon. Taste for seasoning and refrigerate until ready
to use. (Taramosalata will thicken further as it chills.)  Serve as
part of a platter of appetizers (meze) accompanied, if you like, by
cubes of fresh bread for dipping.
NOTE:  A less authentic, but quicker, way to make taramosalata is
to soak and squeeze the bread dry and combine it with the tarama in
the jar of an electric blender.  Blend at medium speed until the
mixture is smooth. Without stopping the blender, remove the cover and
add the lemon juice and onion.  Still blending, pour in up to 1 cup
of oil in a slow, thin stream, adding as much of it as you need to
give the taramosalata its proper consistency.  Taste for seasoning
and refrigerate before using.
