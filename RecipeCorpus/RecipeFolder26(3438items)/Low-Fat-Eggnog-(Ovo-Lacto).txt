Title: Low-Fat Eggnog (Ovo-Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree, Beverage, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 8 servings
4 c  Skim milk
2 t  Vanilla extract
1/2    To 1 cup brandy or rum
x  Nutmeg
1 c  Sugar
4    Egg whites
1/3 c  Water
1/4 t  Cream of tartar
Combine sugar, egg whites, water and cream of tartar in a large
not-aluminum metal bowl; whisk to blend. Set bowl over a pan of
simmering water, taking care that the bowl does not touch the water.
Beat with an electric mixer on medium about 10 minutes, until mixture
registers 140 degress on a candy thermometer and is very thick and
fluffy. Continue to beat 3 more minutes; remove from heat and beat
until mixture has cooled slightly.

Pour milk and vanilla into another large bowl. Add egg white mixture
and brandy or rum; combine gently with a whisk. Serve well-chilled
and dusted with Nutmeg.  (Nog will separate when standing, but is
easily recombined by whisking.)  Serves 8

I found this recipe in the December '94 Vegetarian Times! Enjoy!
