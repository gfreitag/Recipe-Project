So far, the best of my many bread machine cookbooks is 'The Complete
Book of Bread Machine Baking' put out by Trillium Health Books; Lara
Pizzorno, Editor.  I have used the [above] rye bread recipe with
success.  I usually make the tablespoons of gluten flour into
'heaping' tablespoons to ensure good rising.

Put the ingredients in the bread pan in the order listed.  Reverse the
order if the manual for your machine calls for dry ingredients first.
Select Basic Wheat Cycle, Light setting (or the equivalent setting
for you machine). Press Start

**note: I usually use bread flour instead of the unbleached flour
Also, most recipes in this book call for some amount of canola oil, I
just leave it out.
