Sift flour with baking powder, salt and sugar.  Beat egg yolks, add
butter, starter and milk.  Stir into flour mixture. Beat egg whites
till stiff peaks form and then fold into batter. Spoon into preheated
Belgian waffle iron, either well buttered or teflon (I oil my
teflon!) Bake about 5 minutes or until beautifully golden brown! Let

NO calories in these...it's all the good stuff you put on top!!!<ggg>
