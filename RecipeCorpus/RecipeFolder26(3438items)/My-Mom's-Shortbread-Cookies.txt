Title: My Mom's Shortbread Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Bread, Mom's
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Icing sugar
2 c  Flour
1 c  Butter
Mix and knead as in making bread for 15-20 minutes.  The longer it is
kneaded the finer the grain.  Cover and chill in fridge for 1 hour
before cutting in shapes.  Bake in slow oven 300F for 15-20 minutes
or until done. You want them to stay as white as possible so don't
cook until they are browned.  These, if done properly, will literally
melt in you mouth. HONEST!! 8-} Origin: My mom, Shirley Whittaker.
