2 c  Mayonnaise
1 c  Sour cream
1/3 c  White vinegar
2-3 tbsp white sugar
1/2 t  Paprika
1/2 t  Garlic powder
This started out as the 7
-layer salad that it so
-popular.  I have
Adapted it so much, that
-this is the end result.  I
-think it is much
Better than the original.
1 ea Head lettuce, broken into
-bite sized pieces
1 bn Celery, diced
2 ea Green peppers, diced (or
-combo of red, yellow,
-orange and green)
2 bn Green onions, chopped
2 bn Radishes, sliced crossways
2-3 medium carrots, grated
3-5 cups fresh bean
-sprouts, rinsed, drained
In large glass, or see through container (I use the big tupperware
cake server) layer all the ingredients in whatever order you like.
Try to make sure that you have a different color for each layer, and
that no two similar colored layers are close to each other.  Top with
the bacon, then the cheese.  Mix the dressing together and pour over
the whole top of the salad.  Do NOT mix into salad.  Cover and let
chill in fridge for at least 8 hours or overnight. ** This is a
fantastic salad for parties or buffets. You can make it in the
morning or the night before as it has to sit for a while.  If you
make double the amount, pat ingredients dry with paper towel before
layering as water from them being washed tends to drain to the bottom
and the lettuce gets 'soggy'. You will get raves for making and
bringing this one!  It doesn't usually last very long at my place.
It makes goodlunches and great snacks for after school. Origin:
Sharon Stevens. (I got the idea from the original 7 layered salad I
had at a buffet, but have adapted it som much since then, I figure
this version is mine now! 8-} Shared by: Sharon Stevens, Jan/95.
