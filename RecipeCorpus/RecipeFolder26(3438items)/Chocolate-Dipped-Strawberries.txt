30    Firm strawberries; w/hulls
4 oz Semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 T  Vegetable oil
Melt chocolate with oil using a small double boiler or bowl set in hot
water.  Stir until chocolate has melted. If strawberries must be
washed, dry them well. Place melted chocolate in a cup. Gently grasp
hull of berry and dip so that 2/3 of strawberry is covered with
chocolate. Let drain, then gently tap side of hand against top of cup
to dislodge extra chocolate. Place on foil-covered baking sheet or
tray, hull end up. Store in refrigerator. Serve on silver tray or
attractive tray. Military Lifestyle magazine, 1990.
