Modified from "Prairie Fire Reddened Rice", p.115 of _Coyote's
Pantry_ by Mark Miller and Mark Kiffin.  The major differences are
that I replaced the b*tt*r with water for the saute', I like to toast
the rice, and 1/3 cup (even 3 Tbsp) of chile powder is way too
mouth-blistering with the "New Mexico" chile powder I got at the
local Mexican grocery. Total time: about 45 minutes; 30 minutes
unattended

In a large pan or skillet over low heat, saute' 2 cloves garlic and
onion in a tablespoon or so of water, until soft and beginning to
dry. Add rice and increase heat to medium-high; dry-toast until
golden brown, stirring frequently.  Add water and all remaining
ingredients, bring to a boil, and cook for two minutes.

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until
the water has just evaporated.  Remove from heat and let stand five
minutes. Fluff up with a wooden spoon.

Yum yum.
