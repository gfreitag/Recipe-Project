Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------RYE STARTER-----------------------------
2 1/2 t  Yeast
1 T  Gluten
2 c  Lukewarm milk
2 c  Rye flour
Mix the starter ingredients with an electric mixer on low speed until
combined.  Cover your starter and place in a warm, draft-free
location for 4 to 7 days, gently stirring once daily. To replenish
starter: Replace the amount taken out by adding equal parts of milk
or water and flour as was used.  Always use the same kind of flour.
Also, alternate between milk and water for each feeding.  For
instance, your original starter was milk so use water on your first
"feeding". Every third feeding add 1 tablespoon of gluten.
