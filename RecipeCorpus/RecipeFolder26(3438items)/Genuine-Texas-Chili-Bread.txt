Wow ... hot stuff!!  Serve this coarsely textured, very spicy bread
while sitting 'round the campfire after roundin up the hosses. It's
great with a cold beer, or a Dr. Pepper and a side dish of Beans.
Remember if it ain't got beans in it, IT AIN'T CHILI BREAD.
Place all ingredients in bread pan, select a light crust setting, and
press "start".
