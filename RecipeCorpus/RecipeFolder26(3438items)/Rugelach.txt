MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
1 tb Butter; -=OR=-
1 tb Margarine; melted
2 tb Sugar;
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon;
1 c  Butter (2 sticks) -=OR=-
1 c  Margarine; softened
1 pk (8-oz)cream cheese; softened
2 1/2 c  All-propose flour;
TO MAKE FILLING: In small bowl, stir together ground walnuts, sugar
and cocoa; stir in milk. TO MAKE RUGELACH: In a large mixer bowl,
beat softened butter and cream cheese until blended and smooth.
Gradually add flour, beating on low speed of electric mixer until
well blended. Divide dough into three equal parts; wrap each in
plastic wrap, pressing lightly to form small circle.  Refrigerate 3
to 4 hours, or until firm enough to roll. Heat oven to 375 F degrees.
On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of dough into a 9"
circle (keeping dough in the refrigerator). Cut circle into 12
wedges.  Place about 1 teaspoon of the filling at wide end of each
wedge; spread about three-fourths of the way up the wedge. Starting
at the wide end, roll toward point. Place cookies, point sides down,
on ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush with melted butter. Stir together
sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the top of cookies. Bake in a 375
degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden. Remove from cookie
sheet to wire rack. Cool completely.  Repeat procedure with remaining
dough and filling.
