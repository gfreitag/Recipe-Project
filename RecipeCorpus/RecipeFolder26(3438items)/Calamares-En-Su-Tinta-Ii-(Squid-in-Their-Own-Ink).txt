Title: Calamares En Su Tinta Ii (Squid in Their Own Ink)
Categories: Seafood, Main dish, European, Vegetable, Alcohol
Yield: 4 servings
1 T  Fresh parsley, chopped
2 T  Fresh bread crumbs
1/4 c  Brandy
Water
Salt/pepper
2 1/2 lb Small squid, clean, skin,
-reserve ink sacs
1/4 c  Olive oil
2    Onions, chopped
2    Tomatoes, peel, seed, chop
2    Garlic cloves, chop fine
After cleaning squid remove tentacles and push into the body of each
squid. Heat the oil in a large skillet and gently cook the onions and
tomatoes. When the onions begin to soften add the squid and cook
until the body becomes opaque, about 15 minutes. Remove the squid and
put them into a shallow fireproof earthenware dish.
Make a sauce in the skillet by adding the garlic, parsley, bread
crumbs, brandy, a few tablespoons of water, and salt/pepper. Cook for
a few minutes and add the ink from the sacs. Pour this sauce over the
squid.
Cover and cook gently either on top of the stove or in a preheated
oven (325 Deg. F) for one hour or until the squid are tender. Serve
in the same dish with triangles of fried bread and boiled white rice.
