Title: Octopus in Red Wine
Categories: Seafood, Main dish, Tomato, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
4    Tomatoes, peeled, seeded and
-chopped
2 T  Fresh chopped parsley
Salt/pepper to taste
Ink from octopus (optional)
2 lb Octopus, cleaned and skinned
-ink sac reserved
1/3 c  Olive oil
1    Large onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/2 c  Dry red wine
Place octopus in a pan without any liquid, cover and simmer over
heat for 15 minutes. The octopus will extrude its own juice and
simmer in it. Drain the octopus and allow to cool slightly. Cut the
head and tenacles into small pieces, stripping off suckers if desired.
Heat the oil in a skillet and gently fry the onion until it is
transparent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and octopus pieces and stir
over medium heat 5 minutes longer. Add wine and let the stew cook,
uncovered until most of the wine has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
Reduce heat and add the ink from the sac if desired, along with
tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cover the pan, simmer gently over low heat
1 1/2 hours or until the octopus is tender. Add water during cooking
if the mixture looks low in liquid or is scorching. Add most of the
parsley, cook a bit more then serve hot with pasta or rice. Sprinkle
remaining parsley over top. Submitted By ART BARRON   On   12-30-94
