Title: Steaming Tips
Categories: Information, Chinese, Asian
Yield: 1 info  Steaming is a gentle fat-free method of cooking seafood favored
throughout Asia. Suspended over boiling water in a closed container,
fish is surrounded by moist steam heat and retains all its moisture
and natural flavors. Asian cooks prefer steaming fish whole with the
head and tail intact. Fish fillets and steaks work beautifully too
and are delicious and easy to serve. The Chinese always add ginger
and scallions to steamed fish. Korean cooks add robust seasonings
such as garlic, ginger, hot chilies, sesame oil and soy sauce.
Filipinos season their fish with fish sauce, ginger, tomato, garlic,
onion and perhaps a choice of citrus juice, tamarind or vinegar to
give it the characteristic sour tang that they love. Vietnamese lend
a light, delicate flavor with lemongrass, shallots, mint, coriander
and green onions. use any of these embellishments to season fish for
steaming. Select firm-textured fish such as sea bass, cod, trout,
halibut, salmon, rock cod, red snapper or crabs and shrimp.

* When steaming whole fish, allow 10 minutes cooking time for each
inch of thickness, measured at the thickest part.

* Steaks and fillets take 5 to 10 minutes to cook if they are 1 inch
or less thick. Allow 15 to 20 minutes if 2 inches thick.

* Line the steamer rack with banana leaves, ti leaves or aluminum foil
before adding foods such as unshelled shrimp, seafood dumplings or
stuffed buns.

* If your steamer lid is metal, enclose the fish on its platter with a
loose wrap of waxed paper to prevent condensation from falling on the
fish. or wrap the lid, Chinese-style, with a clean kitchen towel to
catch condensation. Bamboo steamer lids simply absorb the moisture
and are outstanding for steaming.

* Herbs and whole spices can be dropped into the steaming water for
additional flavor.
