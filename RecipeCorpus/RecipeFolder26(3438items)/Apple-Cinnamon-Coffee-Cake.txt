Title: Apple Cinnamon Coffee Cake
Categories: Fatfree, Apples, Herbs/spice, Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM-----------------APPLE FILLING AND TOPPING----------------------
5    To 6 cups sliced apples (I
Used Granny Smiths)
2 T  Cinnamon
5 T  Sugar
MMMMM------------------------FOR THE CAKE-----------------------------
Lightly beaten
3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
Flour
1 T  Baking powder
1 t  Nutmeg
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Oil (I used applesauce)
4 t  Vanilla
1/2 c  Orange juice
1 pn Salt
4    Eggs (or equivalent),
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup tube or bundt pan with
Pam.

Combine cinnamon and sugar and set aside 1 tablespoon.  Toss prepared
apples with remainder and set aside.

For the cake, whisk together sugar, applesauce, vanilla, oj, salt, and
eggs.  Combine flour, baking powder, and nutmeg and fold into sugar
mixture.

Spoon a little more than one third of the batter into prepared pan.
Cover with half of apple mixture, then spoon in remaining batter and
apple slices.  Sprinkle top lightly with the reserved cinnamon-sugar.

Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour or until done.  Loosen sides with a
butter knife, then invert cake onto a plate for serving.

(Unsure of the nutrition breakdown, since I deleted the oil.  I think
it's about 1.5 g/fat for 1/12th of cake.)
