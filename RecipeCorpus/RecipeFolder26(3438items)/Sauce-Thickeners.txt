The general rule is to use 1 level Tbsp of starch for each 1 cup of
liquid to be thickened.  In a small bowl, make a paste (slurry) of
the starch with double the amount of liquid, like water, wine, stock,
or citrus juice. Remove the liquid to be thickened from the heat,
stir in the slurry, return to the heat, and stir until thickened and
clear. Arrowroot thickens almost immediately, but cornstarch requires
boiling

for at least 30 seconds to clear its starch taste. Thicken white or
opaque sauces with cornstarch and rice starch. Use arrowroot to
thicken if you want complete clarity or sparkle. Serve
arrowroot-thickened sauces immediately and keep warm; otherwise the
texture becomes slippery. Use cornstarch to thicken sauces with dairy
products, like strained yogurt, and crisp stir-fried vegetable
sauces. Graham Kerr's Kitchen From the collection of Jim Vorheis
