Title: Al's Smoked Salmon
Categories: Fish, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
-skin side down and pat
-dry.  Allow to air dry for
-an
Hour; a glaze will form on
-the salmon.
Place salmon in the smoker
-with small spaces between
-the pieces.  If you are
Using a Little Chief or
-similar smoker, use just
-three pans of wood for the
Smoke. The fish can absorb
-just so much smoke and
-three pans is certainly
Enough. Continue to apply
-the smoker heat until the
-salmon is firm to the
Touch. Cool and store in
-zip-lock bags in the frig.
- Don't worry about how
Long the smoked salmon will
-keep.  It will be gone
-long before it turns off.

Salmon fillets, cut into 2"
-widths
Mixture of 1 part plain
-salt (no iodine) and 2
-parts brown sugar
In a large ceramic or
-stainless steel bowl layer
-in salmon and salt/sugar
Mixture; pat mixture around
-all the pieces of salmon.
-Cover the salmon with a
Plate that is smaller than
-the bowl and weight down
-with something heavy.  I
Use 2-liter plastic pop
-bottles.
Let brine in the frig for
-at least 24 hrs.  The
-juice from the fish makes
-the
Brine liquid.
