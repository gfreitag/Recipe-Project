Title: Brie and Herb Cheeses in Pastry
Categories: Appetizer, Cheese/eggs, Pastry, Herbs/spice
Yield: 10 servings
8 oz Garlic and herb semisoft
-cheese - 2 4-oz. pkgs.
1 ea Egg - beaten to blend
1 T  Water
Puff pastry - 1 10x19-inch
-frozen sheet, thawed
14 oz Brie - a whole wheel
-(Steph, use the smaller
-one)
Lightly flour baking sheet.  Place puff pastry on prepared sheet and
roll out gently to remove fold lines.  Place Brie in center of
pastry. Spread 1 package semisoft cheese on Brie.  Turn Brie over.
Spread remaining semisoft cheese on second side of Brie.  Bring
pastry up around sides and over cheese, wrapping completely and
trimming excess pastry. Turn over and place seam side down. (Using a
toothpick, poke lots of holes in the top of the pastry before putting
decorations on; this helps to keep decorations from popping off when
pastry wrapped around cheese cooks and expands; this is a note from
me after making this several times.) Gather pastry scraps; reroll and
cut out decorations to place on top of pastry if desired (round balls
to constitute grapes; several leaves connected by stems to pile of
grapes; photo shows bunch of grapes connected to three leaves, two
medium, one large.) (Can be prepared one day ahead. Cover and
refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before baking.) Combine egg
and water. Brush over top. Preheat oven to 375F.  Bake pastry until
golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. LET STAND 10 minutes before serving.
Serve warm.
