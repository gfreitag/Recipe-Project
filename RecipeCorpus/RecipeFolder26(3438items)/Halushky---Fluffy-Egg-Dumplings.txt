In a large, chilled mixing bowl, combine the flour, farina, baking
powder and butter. Working quickly, use your fingertips to rub the dry
ingredients and butter together until they blend and look like flakes
of coarse meal. Drop in the eggs and milk and stir vigorously with a
large spoon until the batter is thick and smooth. Bring 2 qts of
lightly salted water to a boil in a heavy 2 1/2 to 3qt casserole,
then reduce the heat so that the water simmers gently. Dip a
tablespoon in cold water, scoop up a tablespoon of batter, and drop
it into the simmering water. Repeat - dipping the spoon beforehand in
water each time - until 6 Tbs of batter have been used. Cover the pan
and simmer 6 to 8 mins until the dumplings have puff up and have
risen to the surface of the water. Remove with a slotted spoon and
drain on paper towels while you cook the remaining dumplings. Serve
either with a stew or roasted meat, or as a separate course topped
with fried onions and sour cream.
