Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8"x 3" springform pan. Trim

cookies.
Beat cream cheese with sugar, vanilla and cornstarch. Add eggs, one
at a time, beating after each addition. Stir in heavy cream.
Alternate layers of cream cheese and cookies, ending with cheese
mixture. Wrap bottom and sides of pan with aluminum foil. Place pan
in a large pan (try roasting pan). Add hot water up to 1-1/2 inch.
Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Turn oven off and leave cake in with
door closed for 1 additional hour. Remove from water, cool and then
refrigerate, covered. (Don't worry if the top resembles the Grand
Canyon.
Just whip up a little more cream and cover up the cracks....no
problem!) Reformatted by: CYGNUS, HCPM52C
