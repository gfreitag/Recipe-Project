Good stuff!

Just a variant note -- shredded carrot can be used in addition to, or
even in place of, the cabbage; also, raspberry vinegar (tres yuppie,
i know) can replace the cider vinegar + honey. If it's still not
sweet enough for your taste you can add some fruit juice; peach works
well. Oh, you can leave out the oil too, esp if you add the fruit
juice (dont want too much liquid in there).
