Categories: Snack, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 3 cups
2 ts Snipped chives
Snipped chives
Assorted crackers
2    7-oz rounds Edam cheese
8 oz Carton dairy sour cream
1/4 c  Beer
Bring cheese to room temperature.  Cut a circle from the top of each
cheese round, about 1/2 inch from edge.  Remove the cut circle of
paraffin coating.  Carefully scoop cheese out, leaving 1/2 inch of
cheese intact to form a shell.  Set shells aside.

Place sour cream, beer, chives, and cheese in a blender container or
food processor bowl. Cover and process till smooth, stopping machine
occasionally to scrape down sides.

Spoon cheese mixture into shells.  Cover and chill several hours or
overnight.  (Cover and chill any remaining cheese mixture and use it
to refill shells.)  Garnish with chives, if desired.  Serve with
crackers. Makes 3 cups.

Hint:  Use a spoon to carefully scoop the cheese out, leaving a
1/2-inch shell.  Break the cheese up into fairly small pieces as you
put it into the blender or food processor.
