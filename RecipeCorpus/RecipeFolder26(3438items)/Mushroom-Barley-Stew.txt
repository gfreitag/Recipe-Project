Title: Mushroom Barley Stew
Categories: Fatfree, Mushroom, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
2 lg Cloves garlic, crushed
1 cn Vegetable stock (I used Hain
Fat-free veggie broth) Or 2
c  Stock you've made yourself
x  Cumin
x  Tabasco sauce
x  Black pepper
x  Tamari
x  Salt (just a bit)
Lemon juice
1 c  Cooked barley
1 c  Cooked garbanzo beans
1/2    Green pepper, chopped
1/2    Red pepper, chopped
1    Carrot, cut into bite-sized
Pieces
1/2    Onion, sliced
x  Chopped mushrooms (use your
Favorite amount or none at
All)
Toss the carrots into a hot wok and cook for a few minutes, add the
garlic, onions and green peppers, deglazig the pan with water or
tamari. Add the mushrooms and cook just until the mushrooms start
giving up their liquid. Add the garbanzo beans, barley, and vegetable
stock.

Add spices to taste.  The tamari really worked well in this, but I
only used a tablespoon for the whole recipe.  The black pepper and
tabasco gave it some "kick" and I threw in the cumin because I like
the flavor. Add these in small amounts if you don't like things
really hot. I ended up having something that was too hot because I
accidentally threw in too much tabasco (I used the lemon juice to
counter it, and it was fine). The salt is optional.  I put in just a
touch.

You can add more water and/or water/tamari mix if you want to make it
a little soupier.

Cook it until it's really hot and serve over toasted whole wheat
bread, like a sloppy joe.  Even though it's been warm during the day
here in the Northeast, we've still had some cool evenings, so hot
food has been okay. This is good served with fruit salad or tossed
salad.
