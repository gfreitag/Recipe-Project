IN GENERAL:  Berries are usually so juicy you'll use them in ways
slightly different from other fruits.  They're excellent for
'spiking' leathers, especially apples, which has enough natural
pectin to compensate for the extra juiciness.  When making an all
berry leather, it's best to add pectin.

REMEMBER:  If it tastes good in the blender, it was taste great as a
leather.  Let you tongue be your guide for ratio's and for sweetening.
APPLE BERRY LEATHER:  Apples are great with virtually any berry.  If
the blended mixture tastes a bit tart, add a touch of honey for
sweetening. BANANA BERRY LEATHER: Banana blackberry and banana
raspberry are very good combinations to try.  Blend the berries
first, remove any seeds if desired, and then add the banana's until
you get the taste you desire. Because of their sweet juiciness, some
of the berry leathers will dry somewhat 'tacky'.  These leathers are
probably best if not kept for extended periods. TO DRY WHOLE BERRIES:
Spread over trays being careful not to squash or bruise berries. Dry
until hard and brittle. Once they are dry, you can use them by
grinding them into a fine consistency then adding a small amount of
hot water to soak. Sweeten with honey and enjoy as jam or as a
topping for fruit salad or yogurt. May also then be combined with
other fruit for a wintertime leather. CURRANTS: Dry as above (whole
berry). These tend to be less sweeter than raisins, but are very nice
in a mixed fruit recipe. Origin: Dry It - You'll Like It! circa 1973.
