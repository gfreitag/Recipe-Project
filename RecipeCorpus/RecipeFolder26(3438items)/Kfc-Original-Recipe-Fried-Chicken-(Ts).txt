"In 1983, in his book BIG SECRETS, author William Poundstone hired a
laboratory to analyze a dry sampling of the spice mixture. The
surprising discovery was that instead of identifying 'eleven herbs
and spices,' the analysis showed only four ingredients: flour, salt,
pepper and monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  The cooking
procedure is believed to be the
other half of the secret. Colonel Sanders became famous for using a
pressure cooker shortly after its invention in 1939."

6 cups Crisco cooking oil
1 each egg, beaten
2 cups milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 Tbsp. salt
2 tsp. black pepper
1 tsp. MSG (you can use Accent)
2 each frying chickens with skin,
each cut into 6 pieces

Pour the oil into a pressure cooker and heat over medium heat to
about 400
degrees. In a small bowl, combine the egg and milk. In a separate
bowl,
combine the remaining four dry ingredients.  Dip each piece of
chicken
into the milk until fully moistened.  Roll the moistened chicken in
the
flour mixture until completely coated.  In groups of four or five,
drop
the covered chicken pieces into the oil and lock the lid in place.
When
steam begins shooting through the pressure release, set the timer
for 10
minutes. After 10 minutes, release the pressure and remove the
chicken to
paper towels or a metal rack to drain.  Repeat with the remaining
chicken.

Note: If you prefer not to use MSG, you may substitute an additional
1/2 Tbsp. of salt.  Be aware, however, that using MSG produces the
best clone of KFC's Fried Chicken. Makes: 12 pieces
