Title: Coconut Chocolate Candy
Categories: Candy, Nuts/grains, Chocolate
Yield: 100 servings
1 lb Flaked coconut
1 lb Pecans, finely ground
3 oz Paraffin (1/2 block)
1 1/2 lb Semisweet chocolate morsels
3/4 c  Butter
14 oz Sweetened condensed milk
2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 ts Salt
5 2/3 c  Powdered sugar
In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low head and do not allow to
brown. Whisk in the condensed milk, vanilla, and salt. Then add the
powdered sugar, coconut, and pecans. Mix quickly; you will have to
use your hands. Coat a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with vegetable spray.
Transfer the candy mixture to the pan and pat it firmly in place.
Cover and store in the coldest part of your refrigerator overnight.
In a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water, melt thr
paraffin and chocolate chips. Cut the coconut candy into 1 inch
squares. Using a toothpick, dip the candy into the chocolate to coat.
Place on waxed paper to harden. Will probably need to be hardened in
the refrigerator and stored there. Ruth from PA
