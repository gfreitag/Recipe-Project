Title: Pasta Sauce (Lee Towe) <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Mushroom, Pasta, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Rosted garlic paste
3 T  Nutritonal yeast
1 T  Cornstarch
1 T  Grated parmesian cheese
4 c  Sliced common white
Mushrooms
2 c  Course chopped onion
1/4 c  Water or vege broth
I used a medium stir fry pan on medium high heat.

Dust pan very lightly with cooking spray.  saute onions until tender.
remove from pan.  add mushrooms and satue until the mushrooms sweat
and create a liquid.  add the onions, garlic, water, yeast and
cheese, and bring to a boil. blend the cornstarch with a couple
tablespoons of *cold* water, and pour into the pan to thicken the
sauce.

Toss with pasta of choice and then sprinke servings with a little
nutritional yeast.

If you like a little more liquid, just increase the amount of water or
broth you add in.
