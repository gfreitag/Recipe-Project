packages dry yeast 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup warm water 1/2 cup
melted butter 2 whole eggs plus 3 egg yolks 1 tsp salt 4-1/2 cups
unbleached white flour 1 egg yolk combined with: 2 tsp flour 2 tsp
sugar 2 tsp water Dissolve the yeast and brown sugar in warm water in
a large mixing bowl. Set aside for about 10 minutes or until the
yeast has become foamy. Stir in the butter, eggs, additional yolks
and salt.  Blend well.  Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing well.
Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead with additional
four for about 5 minutes or until the dough is elastic and not
sticky.  Divided the dough in half. Flatten and shape each half into
a round loaf.  Place on a greased baking sheet, cover loosely with
aluminum foil, and let rise in a warm, draft free place until the
loaves are doubled in bulk, about 1-2 hours. Brush the egg mixture on
the top of the loaves and slash twice with a sharp knife. Sprinkle
with additional sugar and bake in a preheated 325F oven for 35-40
minutes. Cool on a wire rack before slicing.
