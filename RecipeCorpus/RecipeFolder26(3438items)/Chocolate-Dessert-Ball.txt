Title: Chocolate Dessert Ball
Categories: Chocolate, Cheese/eggs, Nuts/grains
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
11 oz Cream cheese, softened
3/4 c  Chocolate chips, melted
1/4 c  Creme de menthe
In a large bowl combine softened cream cheese, melted chocolate chips,
liquer, and cinnamon. Blend until smooth. Chill at least 2 hours.
Form into ball and roll in chopped nuts. Serve with chocolate wafer
cookies. NOTE: I have also used Baileys or Kaluha instead of the
creme de menthe. Very rich.
