2 T  Additional water (makes up

1 cn (10 oz) diced Rotel
-tomatoes, with liquid
1 pk Rice-A-Roni, Spanish style
2 1/4 c  Water (or whatever the
~-------------------Optional------------------------------------------
2-3 Tablespoons nutritional yeast

Saute the rice/vermicelli mix in a *dry* nonstick pan until its golden
brown (don't try adding water or broth, it will stick; just dry-cook
it)

Add the water, tomatoes, and seasoning packet, bring to a boil,
cover, and cook for 20 minutes (basically just what the package says
to do).

Spoon onto plates, and sprinkle with nutritional yeast (I think this
last step *really* makes the dish).

** I missed Rice-A_Roni when I went low-fat, so I was very happy to
find that the Spanish Style is pretty low-fat as boxed; about 1g fat
per serving, 6 servings per box. If I wasn't so lazy, I'm sure I
could make up with a dish that dry-frys vermicelli and rice, then
cooks it with broth and spices, but at this point in my busy life,
having a box in my cupboard is a bit easier. Posted by
