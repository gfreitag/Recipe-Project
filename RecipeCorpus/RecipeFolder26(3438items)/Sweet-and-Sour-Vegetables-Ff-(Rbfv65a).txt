MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 ts Vegetable bouillon
2 tb Arrowroot
Tabasco
1 c  Pineapple juice; unsweetened
1/3 c  Brown sugar; or honey
1/3 c  Balsamic vinegar
3 tb Soy sauce
Drain water chestnuts and bamboo shoots , rinse well, add fresh
water and allow to stand until ready for use. Have all ingredients
prepared and ready to cook. Prepare sauce ahead of time.
:
Pour about 1 oz of the wine into a  deep cook pot - preferably
lined. Turn heat to high. When wine gets hot, add lecithin - if
you're using it - and stir vigorously. Saute carrots for about five
minutes before other vegetables, then drop in pepper, cauliflower,
onions, green onions, garlic and ginger. Begin stirring immediately
and vigorously. Add small amounts of wine as it evaporates but keep
bottom of pot somewhat dry. :
When vegetables have softened, add small amount of wine, broccoli
and pea pods with vigorous stirring. Saute for a few minutes and
cover. If too dry add a small amount of wine. Cook for about three
minutes. Add tofu - if used - pineapple, water chestnuts and bamboo
shoots, stir thoroughly, cover and cook for an additional two or
three minutes. :    Have all ingredients for sauce in a measuring
cup, stir well and pour over vegetables and stir. Turn heat to
medium, stir constantly until sauce just barely bubbles and thickens.
Serve with basmati rice or quinoa - or whatever. Think thin!
