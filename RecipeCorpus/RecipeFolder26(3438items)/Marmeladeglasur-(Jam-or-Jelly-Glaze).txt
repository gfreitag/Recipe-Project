These glazes are Vienna's standard trick for adding a touch of
sweetness between cake layers or - their most important use - to
prime the top cake layer to take a sugar frosting smoothly. What's
more, the glaze undercoat gives the final frosting an extra gloss.
All the sugar-frosting recipes that follow in this chapter presuppose
such an undercoat. JAM GLAZE (generally apricot jam):

Put 2 tablespoons jam through a sieve or food mill so there are no
pieces of fruit in it.  Simmer jam with 1 tablespoon cold water, over
low flame, until hot and well blended..  With pastry brush, s[pread
glaze over cake. ORANGE-MARMALADE GLAZE: Don't put the marmalade
through a sieve (the bits of rind will show through the finished
frosting to give it a pretty, bumpy look); but otherwise proceed as
in Jam Glaze. JELLY GLAZE (generally red currant jelly): Simmer 2
tablespoons jelly (with no water) over low flame until melted and
hot.  Wiht pastry brush, spread glaze over cake. (Glaze for 8-inch
torte). From: THE ART OF VIENNESE PASTRY by Marcia Colman Morton.
