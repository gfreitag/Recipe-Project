Yield: 4 servings
4    Cloves Garlic, roasted
1 tb Dried Chili Powder
1/4 c  Fresh Lime Juice
1/2 c  Grated Sharp Cheddar
2 c  Fresh Corn
1/2 c  Sour Cream
1/2 c  Snipped fresh Scallion

1/2 lb Dried Black Turtle Beans
2    Large Dried Pasilla Chilies
Soaked and drained
2 qt Water
1/4 c  Virgin Olive Oil
1 tb Salt

In a large pot, place beans and cover with 2 to 3 quarts of
water. Soak overnight. Drain, or bring water and beans to a boil,
reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Allow to soak 1 hour. Drain.

In a large pot over high heat, place the 1/4 cup olive oil and the
onions, and saute until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the chili powder
and cook for 1 minute. Add the beans and the pasillas or hot peppers.
Fill the pot with cold water until the beans are covered by 1" of
water. Add 1 tb salt and black pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer,
reduce heat to medium and cook until the beans are tender, about 1
1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the pasillas.

Stir in the roasted garlic and lime juice. Adjust the salt and pepper
to taste if necessary. Add the corn and cook until hot, about 3
minutes. Ladle into warm bowl. Top with sour cream, Cheddar and
scallion greens. Serve immediately.

TO ROAST THE GARLIC:

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat the outside of a whole or partial
head of garlic with olive oil or corn oil and place it in an
ovenproof skillet. Roast on the lower rack of the oven until the skin
is brown and the garlic is tender, about 30 to 60 minutes.
