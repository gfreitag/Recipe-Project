24 hours beforehand, make the stuffing. Chop the apricot coarsely,
mix with breadcrumbs and chopped onions. Melt the butter, pour over,
add honey, salt, pepper and thyme. Mix well together, then mix in
beaten egg.

Make marinade by mixing all the ingredients together.

Bone or have boned the  lamb.  (Tunnel  bone  for stuffing). Stuff the
cavity loosely. Sew up the opening. Put lamb in a polythene bag long
enough to hold it comfortably. Add bones. Pour over the marinade, tie
the top with a bag seal, sucking out excess air. Stand in a bowl (to
catch leaks). Marinade overnight, turning from time to time.

Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F (Mk 4). Remove  lamb from marinade and dry well.
Drain marinade and fry vegetables in roasting pan very briefly. Place
lamb on top and roast 25 mins/lb oven ready weight. Baste frequently
with marinade while cooking. Meanwhile make a little lamb stock from
bones.

When done, take out of oven,  Remove  strings  from joint and leave
to rest 15 mins while making the gravy, then carve crosswise. For the
gravy, remove vegetables  from  roasting  tin,   pour  off roasting
juices, leaving 2 tbs fat in pan. Fry 2 tbs flour in this, return
aqueous part of roasting juices and remaining marinade. Add lamb
stock if needed. Season to taste. Submitted By IAN HOARE   On
