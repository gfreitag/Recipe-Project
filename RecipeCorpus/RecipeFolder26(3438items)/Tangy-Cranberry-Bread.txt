Dried cranberries are sometimes called "ruby raisins."

SUCCESS HINTS: Place dried cranberries away from water if baking on
delayed time cycle. This recipe can be baked with regular or delayed
time baking cycles

Sylvia's comments: I didn't have dried cranberries, so stuck some
frozen berries in the oven for a couple hours at 250.  Presto!  Dried
cranberries. I added them during the second beep.  I also cut the
cranberry juice down to 1 cup for the large loaf, and the dough still
looked VERY wet. It came out with a pale top but cooked, and was a
big hit with visiting cranberry fans.
