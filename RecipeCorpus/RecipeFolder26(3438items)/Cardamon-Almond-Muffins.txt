Title: Cardamon-Almond Muffins
Categories: Bread, Fatfree
Yield: 10 servings
1 t  Ground cardamon
3/4 c  Soymilk
1/2    Cup
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
1 1/2 t  Baking powder
1 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Salt
Tbsp  pear puree (directions follow) 2 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp
2
almond extract 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp artificial sugar substitute (or 2
Tbsp  cornstarch
Tbsp sucanat) 2

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Coat 10 muffin wells with non-stick
spray. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In
a medium bowl, stir together remaining ingredients. The cornstarch
will tend to stick together as a lump; make certain it is completely
dissolved in the liquid.  Pour dry ingredients in to wet and stir
just long enough to mix completely.  Spoon batter into the prepared
muffin wells (the wells will be about half-full). Bake muffins for
25-30 minutes, until tops are lightly golden.  Allow the muffins to
rest a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack.  Serve, or cool
completely and store in an air-tight container up to two days.

Pear puree:  Puree is easily made by blending, until smooth, half of
the fruit in a 15 oz. container of canned pears (packed in fruit
juice is preferrable) .  "Baby food" pureed pears are an even faster
alternative.

Note: If pears packed in juice are used, 1/4 cup of the juice can be
substituted for 1/4 of the soymilk and the sweetener omitted.
