Title: Turkish Coffee
Categories: Beverage, Middle east, Turkish
Yield: 1 servings
Coffee
(2 ts sugar)
1/3 c  Water
1 ts To 1 tb finely pulverized
As Turkish coffee settles very repidly, it is made at the table, over
an alcohol lamp. The average content of the long-handled metal pot is
about 10 oz. of liquid, and it should neer be filled to more than 2/3
capacity. The pot is narrowed before it flares at the top, to allow
the swishing and swinging of its contents between "frothings" - a
procedure which keeps the very finely divided grains in suspension
until the liquid is sipped from tiny stemmed cups holding about a tb
of fluid. In the Near East it is considered impolite to drink more
than three of these, although more may be served in the United
States. The connoisseur adds no sweetening to the brew itself. No
commercial grind available in America proves fine enough for Turkish
coffee, so take the finest you can get and pulverize it further in an
electric blender.

DIRECTIONS: For each serving, place in a Turkish coffeemaker, the
ingredients listed above. Heat until the coffee rises to a boil.
Remove at once from heat but only momentarily. Repeat this process a
second and third time. Never allow the coffee to boil. Serve the
coffee at once so that a little of the lighter frothy top goes into
each cup first and is followed on the next round by some of the
heavier liquid on the bottom. *From Joy Of Cooking Cookbook*
