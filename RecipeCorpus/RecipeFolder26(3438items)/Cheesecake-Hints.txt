Hi Claudia:  Here is a compliation of some "research" I did. I had to
~ 'cause I hate to tell you this - but; I get a perfect cheesecake
every time, so other than the corn starch I was stumped. Here are
some things I came across: 1. Wrapping the pan with foil keeps it
watertight.
2. If you grease the sides of the pan first, the surface will not
crack when the cake starts to shrink on cooling. (It always shrinks a
little).
3. Chill thoroughly before unmolding. In fact, I make my cheesecakes
one day ahead of serving and leave it in the springform till I'm
ready to use.
4. The water bath pan must NOT be higher than the springform pan or
it will slow down baking. Also, put no more than 1" of water in pan.
5. Check oven temperature for accuracy.
6. When done, turn oven off, DO NOT OPEN DOOR, let sit for one hour.
Then remove, place on a rack, and let cool to room temperature (about
1 hour). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
7. Use 1 Tbl cornstarch per 2 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese. Use
Philadelphia brand cream cheese.  It is the best and works EVERY
time. 8. IMPORTANT: Use the egg size specified. If none is specified,
use large (not jumbo or extra-large).
