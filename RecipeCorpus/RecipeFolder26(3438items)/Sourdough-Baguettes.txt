Title: Sourdough Baguettes
Categories: Breadmaker, Sourdough
Yield: 5 servings
3/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Sugar
2 ts Yeast
1 1/4 c  Starter, at room temp.
1/4 c  Water
2 ts Olive oil
2 1/2 c  Bread flour
Take starter out of fridge the night before starting bread.  Feed
starter (1 c AP Flour, 1/2 c Water) and let it come to room temp as
it is digesting the feeding.  Put ingredients into the pan in the
order listed. Set for dough , press start.

When the cycle is completed, remove dough, squeeze out gasses, place
in a bowl, cover with a damp teatowel and let rest for 30 minutes.

Sprinkle corn meal on the counter, shape dough into 2 thin cylenders,
place loaves into baguette pan, cover with a teatowel and let rise in
the fridge 12 to 24 hours.

Remove from fridge, sprinkle with water, and let sit until fully
risen. Sprinkle with water again and bake in conventional oven at 375
F for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty.  For really crusty bread,
spray with water every 5 minutes while baking!

Notes from Gord:  I feed the starter after taking the required amount
out. Then I let it sit out overnite and refigerate it.  That way I
can take it out of the fridge in the AM, let it work til the
afternoon, make the dough, put it in the baguette pan and put it in
the refigerator. The next day I'll take it out mid morning and let it
rise, then bake it about 4-5 PM. Voila, fresh baguettes for supper.
This way saves one day in the process which is long enough as it is!

NOTE: THIS RECIPE CAN ALSO BE BAKED IN THE BREADMAKER ON REGULAR
CYCLE. (Note form G:  I've done this once and it is ok but not nearly
as sour and not nearly as crusty.)
