Categories: Breadmaker, Sourdough, Pizza
Yield: 1 large loaf
1/2 ts Oregano leaves; crumbled
1 3/4 c  Sourdough starter
1    Eggs
2 tb Oil
1/4 c  Pepperoni; finely minced
1/2 tb Yeast
3 c  Flour
1 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt

A very unique bread, guaranteed to garner many compliments.

Combine all ingredients in bread machine.

Sylvia's notes: I substituted some chopped olives and leftover turkey
for the pepperoni, and it came out fine. Overrose and then cratered,
but I give up; after several tries, I haven't been able to produce a
perfect loaf. If you don't mind cratered tops, the flavor's fine.
