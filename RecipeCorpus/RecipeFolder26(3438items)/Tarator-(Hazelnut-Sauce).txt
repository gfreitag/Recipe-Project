1/4 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  Red wine vinegar
3 tb Mayonnaise; preferably fresh

The tomalley and coral from
A boiled lobster (optional),
(don't ask, I don't know)
;makes about 1 1/2 cups
2 c  Hazelnuts; shelled or 2 cups
;shelled walnuts pulverized
;in a blender or with a nut
;grinder or mortar/pestle
1 c  Bread crumbs; soft, made
;from white bread with crust
;removed and pulverized in a
;blender or pulled apart and
;shredded with a fork
1 tb Garlic; finely chopped
1/2 ts Hot red pepper, dried;
In a large bowl, toss the nuts, bread crumbs, garlic, red pepper,
cayenne pepper, paprika and salt together with a fork until they are
thoroughly combined.  Pour in the olive oil and vinegar and mash them
into the dry ingredients until they are completely absorbed.  Stir in
the mayonnaise. Then beat in water, a tablespoon at a time, using
only enough to thin the sauce sufficiently to hold its shape lightly
in a spoon. If you are using the lobster tomalley and coral, force
them through a fine sieve with the back of a spoon directly into the
sauce. Mix thoroughly. Taste for seasoning and refrigerate until
ready to use. (If the sauce becomes too firm in the refrigerator,
beat in a teaspoon or two of cold water to soften it.)
Serve tarator with cold boiled lobster or shrimp.
