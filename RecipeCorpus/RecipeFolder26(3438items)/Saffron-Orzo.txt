*  Orzo is known as Rosamarina in Italian because the little grains of
pasta resemble rosemary leaves.

Bring about 3 quarts of water to a rapid boil in a large covered pot.
Crumble the saffron into a small heatproof bowl and stir in about 3
tablespoons of theboiling water; set aside.  Stir the orzo into the
pot of boiling water, cover, and return it to a boil.  Cook until al
dente, or for about 8 minutes.  Taste it frequently and when the
grains of pasta are cooked, but still firm and separate, drain the
orzo and quickly toss it in a serving bowl with the saffron water and
Pecorino cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve hot. Makes 4

NOTE:  "This golden, fragrant side dish is a good alternative to rice
when you are either in a hurry or just in the mood for a change.  It
is especially suited to Spanish, Caribbean, and North African
cuisines." [Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home; The Moosewood
