Another untried recipe, offered as ransom for recipes stolen,
off-topic postings, and ill received boasting about Texas.......

Recipe quoted from Elena's Secretes of Mexican Cooking, Elena Zelayeta

"This dessert is usually served during Lent.  The combination of
cheese and fruits may sound strange, but it's extremely popular in
Mexico and I know many Americans who rave over it.

Boil water, sugar, stick cinnamon an dclove together until syrupy.
Butter a casserole generously and put in a layer of bread or cake
cubes. Cover with a layer of banana or apple slices and sprinkle with
some of the raisins, peanuts, almonds and cheese cubes. Repeat the
layers until all ingredients are used. Remove stick cinnamon and
clove from syrup and pour syrup over Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN
