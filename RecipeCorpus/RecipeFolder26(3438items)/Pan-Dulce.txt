MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
3 T  Sugar
1/2 t  Salt
2 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 t  Yeast
5/8 c  Milk (5 oz.)
1 ea Egg
2 T  Butter
1 t  Vanilla extract
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 ea Egg yolk
1 T  Vanilla extract
All-purpose flour
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Powdered sugar
4 T  Cold butter, cut into
-several pcs.
For the topping, mix together the flour and sugar.  Using your
fingers or a pastry blender, cut in the cold butter until a granular
(cornmeal) consistency is obtained.  Add the egg yolk and vanilla and
mix (with hands is easiest although messy) until a stiff dough (like
a cookie dough) is obtained.  Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces,
flatten into small rounds (about 3") and place on a sheet of waxed
paper and set aside. Upon completion of the dough cycle, grease hands
with vegetable oil to prevent the dough from sticking (this is
instead of flouring the counter). Divide the dough into 8 equal
pieces and flatten between the palms of your hands into small (3")
rounds.  Place each round on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Place a
piece of topping on each one.  Using a sharp knife or razor blade,
score a line or two into the topping.  Cover with a towel and place
in a warm, draft free location to rise for about 30 minutes. Bake in
a preheated 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes.
