Categories: Tex/mexican, Beef, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea 4-oz can chopped green
-chilies
1/2 md Chopped onion
1 t  Salt to taste
1 lb Ground beef
1 lb Grated cheddar/colby cheese
10 ea Count pkg flour tortillas
1 ea 10-oz can green chile sauce
1 ea 8-oz can tomato sauce
ENCHILADA FILLING: Brown ground beef and drain excess fat. Stir in
half of the green chile sauce, half of the tomato sauce, half the
green chilies, the chopped onion and salt. Bring to a boil and allow
to simmer while making the cheese sauce. CHEESE SAUCE: In medium
sauce pan, combine the rest of the green chile sauce, the tomato
sauce, and the green chilies. Bring to a boil, Slowly add 2/3 of the
cheese allowing it to melt. Stir often to keep it from scorching. If
cheese isn't grated it will take longer to melt. The sauce is ready
when the cheese is mixed well. Warm flour tortillas in microwave or
oven, just enough to allow them to bend easily. Put about half cup or
so of the filling in each tortilla sprinkled with some of the
remaining cheese, roll and place in a casserole dish. The filling
should be divided evenly between the 10 flour tortillas. Pour the
cheese sauce over the enchiladas and bake in the oven at 350 degrees
for about 15 minutes.
