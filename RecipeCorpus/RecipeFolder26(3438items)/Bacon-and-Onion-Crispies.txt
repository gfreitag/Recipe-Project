Title: Bacon and Onion Crispies
Categories: Appetizer, Pork, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Dried mixed herbs
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 c  Soft white bread crumbs
Vegetable oil for deep
Frying
4    Slices of bacon diced
1    Small onion minced
3 tb Marg. or butter
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Milk
Melt the margarine in a small saucepan, add the bacon and onion and
cook over moderate heat for 3-4 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and
stir over low heat for 1-2 minutes until straw-coloured. Remove from
the heat and gradually stir in the milk. Return the pan to the heat
and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring all the time until very thick and
creamy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool completely. Stir the
herbs into the mixture, divide into 8 equal portions, then form each
portion into a ball. Put the egg and bread crumbs in separate shallow
dishes. Roll each ball in the egg, then coat with the bread crumbs.
Heat enough oil in a deep-fat fryer to cover the balls to 350 degrees
or until a stale bread cube browns in 60 seconds. Add the balls to
the oil a few at a time and deep-fry for 2-3 minutes, until golden
brown on all sides. Drain the Bacon and Onion Crispies on absorbent
paper towels, then serve.
