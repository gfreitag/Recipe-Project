1    7-oz tube of marzipan
Assorted food colorings
8 oz Oreo cookies, crushed in a
Food processor
Carrot Cake (separate
-recipe)
Cream Cheese Icing (separate
-recipe)
1. Make carrot cakes as directed and let cool to room temperature.

2. Make icing as directed. Position cakes side by side so that their
long sides are touching, and ice as one cake, setting aside 1 C of
icing for decorating.

3. To make pickets for garden fence, roll out half the marzipan to
1/16" thickness. Cut into even strips about 1/2" wide by 3" long,
making pointed ends for tops of pickets. Keep marzipan covered with a
damp cloth when not in use.

4. To make vegetables, form golf-ball-size pieces out of remaining
marzipan. With a toothpick, add a dab of food coloring to each ball
and knead with fingers until color is well mixed. Mold marzipan into
vegetable shapes, such as tomatoes, eggplants, cars of corn,
cabbages, and pumpkins.

5. Cut garden paths out of lightweight cardboard and place on cake.

6. Sprinkle crushed Oreos on cake and press into frosting with a
spoon. With spoon, clear crumbs from cardboard garden paths and
remove cardboard. Fill a pastry bag with icing and, with a zigzag
tip, pipe over paths.

7. Build fence by pressing pickets into icing on all sides of cake,
leaving space for an entrance. Group each variety of vegetables in a
different section of the garden to create vegetable patches. Chill
cake briefly.

8. Place entire cake in a large basket and surround with fresh, clean,
unsprayed grass.
