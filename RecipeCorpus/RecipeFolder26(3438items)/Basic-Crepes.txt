Title: Basic Crepes
Categories: Fatfree, Cheese/eggs, Pancakes
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour or
Unbleached white flour
4    Egg substitutes
1 1/4 c  Water
1 c  Rice milk
Put all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend at high
speed for 1 min.  Refrigerate, covered for 2 hrs. before cooking.
Batter should have consistency of heavy cream. If necessary, thin
with more liquid.

To cook crepes, heat an omelet or crepe pan on low heat for a few
minutes. No need to add oil, these cook fine without it. Remove from
heat, pour in 3 or 4 tablespoons of batter and tilt pan so batter
coats the bottom. Put pan on burner, cook crepe for a few minutes
over medium low heat until lightly browned or batter begins to
bubble. Flip crepe over and cook other side for about 30 sec.  Gently
remove and place on a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter,
stacking crepes as they're cooked. Use with favorite breakfast,
dinner or dessert crepe filling.

Note:  I didn't notice this until I started typing this in, but I
didn't cook mine on med-low heat.  I heated my pan on med-high and
turned it down a notch when ready to cook. They turned out fine,
didn't stick and the edges were just a little crispy (the way I like
'em).
