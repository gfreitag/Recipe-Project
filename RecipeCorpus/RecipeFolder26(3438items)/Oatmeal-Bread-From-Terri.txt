Title: Oatmeal Bread From Terri
Categories: Bread, Nuts/grains
Yield: 2 servings
1 c  Cold water
1/4 c  Warm water
1 pk Yeast
1 1/2 c  Uncooked oatmeal
6 c  Sifted flour
1 c  Scalded milk
2 tb Shortening
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Maple syrup
Mix milk, shortening, salt, honey and maple syrup, stir in cold water
and cool to lukewarm.  Pour warm water into a warm very large bowl,
sprinkle in yeast and stir to dissolve.  Add cooled mixture, oatmeal
and 4 c flour and mix well.  Mix in remaining flour and knead on a
lightly floured board until elastic, 5 to 8 minutes.  Shape into a
ball, place in a greased bowl, turning to grease all over.  Cover
with cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about
1 1/2 hours. Punch down and knead lightly 1 to 2 minutes.  Divide
dough in half, shape into 2 loaves and place in greased 9 x 5 x 3
inch loaf pans. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk.
Toward end of rising, preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake loaves 40
minutes until browned and hollow sounding when tapped.  Turn out and
cool upright on a wire rack before cutting.
