Hello to you, Judith! I am a law librarian (wonder how many
librarians are lurking here?) who is interested in FOOD! You'll find
the support you are looking for on this list. You might try
EAT-LF@apollo.it.luc.edu and EAT-L@VTVM1.CC.VT.EDU. The EAT-L list
isn't lowfat or fatfree but sometimes recipes are posted that you
might be interested in. Another one is VEGLIFE@VTVM1.CC.VT.EDU.There
are also several vegetarian/fatfree newsgroups on Usenet.
