Title: Almond-Pecan Pie Crust
Categories: Dessert, Pie/tart, Nuts/grains, Pastry
Yield: 1 9" pie cst
1/3 c  Chopped pitted soft dates
3 tb Water
1 c  Almonds
1/2 c  Pecans
In separate bowls, cover almonds & pecans with water & let soak for 8
to 12 hours.  Drain & rinse.

In a food processor, grind almonds to a consistency of moist meal.
Place in a bowl & set aside.  Grind pecans in the same way & stir in
with the almond meal.  Blend dates & water until smooth.  Stir into
the nut mixture & mix well.  Shape into a ball & place on a 12" waxed
piece of paper. Top with another piece of waxed paper.  Roll out
dough into an 11" diameter.

Carefully remove the top piece of waxed paper.  Invert pie crust into
an oiled 9" pie plate & press down gently.  Trim the edges.  (It
doesn't say, but I think that one should then remove the other piece
of paper).

Place crust in a preheated oven at 250F.  Turn off heat immediately &
let the crust sit until it is dried, about, 30 minutes.
