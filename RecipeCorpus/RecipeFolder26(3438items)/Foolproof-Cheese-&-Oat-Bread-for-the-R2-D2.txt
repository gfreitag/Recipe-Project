Title: Foolproof Cheese & Oat Bread for the R2 D2
Categories: Breadmaker, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 20 servings
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Oil
1    Eggs
1 c  Water; warm
1 c  Cheese, shredded
1/2 tb Yeast
2 1/2 c  Flour, bread
1 c  Oats
1/4 c  Milk, powdered
1/2 tb Salt
Sharp cheddar cheese is recommended.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" to 11 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot and humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Tested in DAK 1-1/2 lb R2D2 bread machine.  Sylvia's comment: a
hearty, easy-to-slice bread, surprisingly good for sandwiches. I even
used powdered buttermilk when I ran out of powdered milk with good
results.
