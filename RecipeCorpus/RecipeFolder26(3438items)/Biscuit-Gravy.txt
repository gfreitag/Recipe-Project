1/4 t  Salt
1/2 t  Fresh ground black pepper

Mix flour and water until smooth and no lumps. Put into medium sauce
pan, and heat over medium-high heat until the mixture boils. Reduce
heat, stirring constanly, and boil for 4 - 5 minutes. Mixture should
be very think and blubbery. Add milk and stir until the mixture is
smooth again. Add spices, and return to boil, cooking until it has
the consistancy of thick gravy.

Serve over split baking powder biscuits, with fruit (whole-berry
cranberry sauce was *great* with this dish!), grits, red beans &
rice, toast & jam, etc.

Makes enough for about 4 biscuits.
