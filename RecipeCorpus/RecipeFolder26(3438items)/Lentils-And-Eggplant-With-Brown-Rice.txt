Rice Cooker: Put the sherry or stock into the rice cooker with the
sherry or stock, and turn on the machine. Let the onion saute, as you
chop and add the garlic, mushrooms, carrot, and eggplant. Give the
pot a quick stir as you add each vegie. Add water if the vegetables
start to stick, Let the eggplant cook about a minute or so, then add
the lentils, rice, liquids, basil, and oregano. Cover, let it cook,
and allow to stand about 10 minutes when the cooker shuts off. Stir
in the parsley and serve.

Slow Cooker: Saute the vegies lightly, then add everything but
parsley to the crockpot. Cook on low if you want to ignore it all
day, or 3-4 hours on high. Add parsley and serve.

Stovetop: Saute the vegies, add everything but the parsley, cover and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 40-45 minutes, or until
liquid is absorbed. Stir in parsley.
