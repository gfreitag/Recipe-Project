1/2 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Starter

STARTER: Mix together and let sit on counter. Stir every day until it
has sat for at least 3 to 4 days. You will know it is ready when it
keeps popping the plastic lid off itself, or tends to become really
sticky when you stir it.
You can then proceed with any of the Friendship cake instructions
using your own starter.  Just start with the day one instructions and
continue to add the sugar, flour, etc. BREAD: Mix it all together and
place into a greased and sugared bread pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for
50 minutes. Submitted By DOROTHY FLATMAN   On   01-06-95
