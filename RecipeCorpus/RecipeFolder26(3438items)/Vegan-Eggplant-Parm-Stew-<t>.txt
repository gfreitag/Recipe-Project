Title: Vegan Eggplant Parm Stew <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1    15oz can Great Northern
Beans, rinsed and drained
1    15oz can Black-eyed peas,
Rinsed and drained
1/2 c  Nutritional yeast
2 t  Dried oregano leaves
3/4 t  Salt
1/2 t  Fresh ground pepper
2    Tomatoes, chopped
8 c  Water
1    (6oz) can unsalted tomato
Paste
1 T  Minced fresh garlic
1 lg Onion, chopped
1 md Eggplant, unpeeled and
Chopped
10 oz Pkg frozen chopped mustard
Greens, thawed (or half a
16 oz Bag)
Combine water, tomato paste, and garlic in very large soup pot.  Add
onion, eggplant and mustard greens.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer, uncovered, until eggplant is tender, but firm (about 15
minutes).

Combine 2 cups of the soup broth (from pot), the can of Great Northern
beans, the nutritional yeast, and the seasonings in a blender. Process
until very smooth.  Pour into soup pot and mix well.  Stir in
black-eyed peas, and tomatoes.  Simmer, uncovered, until the beans
are heated and the tomatoes softened.

This would probably be really good with cauliflower instead of
eggplant, too.  Mmmm and maybe zucchini.
