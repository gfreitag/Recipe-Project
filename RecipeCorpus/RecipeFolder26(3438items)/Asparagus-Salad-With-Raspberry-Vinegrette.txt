Title: Asparagus Salad With Raspberry Vinegrette
Categories: Side dish, Fatfree, Salad, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Raspberry vinegar
1/2 c  Water
1 T  Sugar or honey
1 t  Parsley
2 lb Fresh asparagus, washed well
-and cut into 1" pieces
1    Red pepper, seeded and cut
-into 1/4" x 1" pieces
1    Red onion, chopped
Steam the asparagus pieces for 2 minutes.  Plunge into cold water to
stop cooking.  Drain.

Put asparagus, red pepper and onion into a plastic bowl (with cover).
Blend vinegar, water, sugar (honey) and parsley in a separate bowl
and then pour over vegetables.  Adjust seasonings if desired (may
want to add more sweetness).  Stir, cover and refrigerate for at
least 24 hours. Stir every so often.

Serve cold as a side salad.

Hint:  make sure you only use the tender part of the asparagus.  My
mom taught me that you hold the tip and base of the asparagus in
separate hands and then bend it until it breaks.  Only use the tip
end and use the base end for soup or compost it.
