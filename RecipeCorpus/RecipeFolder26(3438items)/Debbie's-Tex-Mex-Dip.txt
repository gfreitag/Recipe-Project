2 cn (10 1/2 oz.) cans

Spread bean dip in a 9x13" pan or two 8x8" pans (one can in each).
In a medium bowl, blend the sour cream, mayonnaise, and taco
seasoning mix. Pour oven bean dip and spread evenly.  Peel and seed
the avocadoes; place in a large bowl and mash, getting the lumps out
as much as possible.  Add the lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Pour
over the sour cream mixture and spread evenly.  Spread the chopped
green onion over all.  Top with shredded cheddar cheese.  Serve
chilled with tortilla chips.

* = They now seem to make these in 9 oz.  If desired, use 3 - 9 oz.
cans. Can usually be found in the potato chip aisle in the
supermarket.

Note:  If you are an olive lover, you can add some chopped or sliced
drained black olives after the onions and before the cheese.
