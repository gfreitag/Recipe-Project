the kale, setting them both aside. In olive oil, saute the onion
until wilted, add the garlic and saute, but don't brown. Add the
cabbage, carrots, potatoes, broth, tomato paste, wine vinegar and
seasonings. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a
blender, puree half the beans with the 3 cups of bean water. After
the 30 minutes, add the whole beans and the puree to the soup. Simmer
until the potatoes are tender, adding extra water and salt or ground
pepper, if necessary. Just before serving stir in the kale for a
minute or two, just until it wilts. SOURCE:* Mother Earth News
