Title: Fatfree Baking Powder Biscuits
Categories: Fatfree, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1/2    To 2/3 cup
Cold low-fat buttermilk,
Skim milk or milk
Substitute
2 c  Flour*
2 T  Baking powder
3/4 t  Salt
1/2 c  Apple sauce
In a larger bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.
Sprinkle the applesauce over the flour, and cut in with a pastry
blender until it is in bits the size of split peas. The texture
should be somewhat course.

Sprinkle 1/2 cup cold milk over the flour and applesauce, and stir it
in quickly with a fork. Add only as much of the milk as is necessary
to make the dough hold together.

Gather the dough up into a ball, working it together with your hands
very briefly, and then roll it out 1/2 inch thick on a floured board.
Cut out small rounds (about 2 1/2" to 3" in diameter) and place them
on a cookie sheet spritzed with Pam. If you aren't going to put them
in the oven immediately, chill them in the refrigerator until ready
to bake.

Bake the biscuits in a preheated oven at 450 degrees for 10 to 12
minutes, or until puffed and lightly browned on top.

Makes about 15 - 20 biscuits.

* preferably, use white pastry flour. All-purpose flour or whole-wheat
pastry flour can be used, but the biscuits will be denser and less
fluffy.
