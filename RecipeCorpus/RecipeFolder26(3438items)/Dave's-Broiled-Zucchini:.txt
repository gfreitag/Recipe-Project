Title: Dave's Broiled Zucchini:
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
x  Oregano
x  Salt
x  Pepper
x  Grated parmesan cheese, or
Ff mozzarella if you prefer
x  Medium sized zucchini(s)
(about 1/2 per person as a
Side dish)
x  Garlic
x  Basil
Wash the zukes and slice into planks about 1/8" to 1/4" thick. I
prefer not to peel them, but do sometimes if the skin is bruised or
unattractive. If the zukes are large (long), cut the planks in half.
Arrange the planks on a baking sheet.

Crush the garlic (I cheat and use chopped garlic from a jar) and
spread it on the zucchini. When in doubt, use more :)

Sprinkle on a little basil and oregano, salt and pepper to taste.

Sprinkle on a little grated parmesan cheese.

Cook under the broiler 5 - 8 minutes until the zukes are tender, and
the cheese is brown.

Serve hot, and don't count on leftovers!
