Cream margarine and sugar.  Add eggs and vanilla.  Beat.  Add milk,
beat. Add dry ingredients and beat.  Continue beating until the
mixture turns creamy white. (Can sometimes take a good 5 minutes or
so)  Add raisins and nuts if desired.  Pour batter into 8x8 greased
pan and bake at 350F for about 30 minutes. This is a great basic cake
recipe. I have used it as a base for spiced and chocolate cakes,
upside down cakes, and it makes wonderful cupcakes. Just remember to
beat it until it turns a nice creamy consistency and you can't ever
have it fail on you! This is the only cake recipe that I use
consistently and have used it for many years now. Origin: From Nancy
Cunningham's mother, Dorothy Hall. Shared by: Sharon Stevens, Jan/95.
