Slice the tomatoes 1/2 inch thick, but do not peel or core.  Drain
well between several thicknesses of paper toweling until most of the
moisture of the tomatoes is absorbed.  While the tomatoes are
draining, make a batter by beating the eggs until light, then mixing
in the corn meal, water, minced chives, salt and pepper.  In a large,
heavy iron skillet, heat the butter or margarine until bubbly.  Dip
the tomato slices into batter, and brown quickly on both sides. Serve
at once.
