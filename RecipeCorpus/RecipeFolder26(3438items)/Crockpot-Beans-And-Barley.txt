Title: Crockpot Beans And Barley
Categories: Fatfree, Crockpot, Beans
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Pearl barley
1/2 c  Mushrooms, chopped
1 c  Pinto beans, uncooked
4 c  Vegetable broth
3 T  Parsley, minced
1/4 c  Lentils, dried
1    Onion, chopped
1    Carrot, chopped (I used 2, I
Like them)
1 c  Navy beans, soaked
1/2 t  Prepared mustard
1/2 c  Split peas, dried
Soak white and pinto beans overnight. Saute onion, mushrooms and
carrot in 1 T of vegetable broth until tender. Add drained beans,
vegetable bouillon, mustard and parsely, bring to bil. Reduce heat,
cover and simmer 45 minutes. Add split peas, lentils and barley.
Cover and simmer another hour until all beans are tender. (Note: I
like it spicy so I added lots of tabasco and pepper). I know this is
more of a "winter recipe" but I think it will be good cold, also.
Things got a bit mushy in the crockpot so it might be better to cook
on the stove.
