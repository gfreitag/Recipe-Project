1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs; room temp
1 c  Milk; room temp
2 lg Garlic cloves; minced
2    Jalape¤o peppers; minced
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
4    Green onions; minced

5 oz Cheddar cheese; grated
-(abt 1 1/4 cups packed)
1/4 lb Tasso, andouille or
-other smoked sausage
-minced, fried til crisp
1 1/2 c  Fine yellow cornmeal
Pour 1 tablespoon of oil onto the bottom of a 15x10-inch jelly roll
pan; spread over bottom and sides. Put the pan in the oven and
preheat oven to 400øF. In a small bowl, mix 1/4 cup each of the green
onions, cheese and cooked sausage and set aside.

In a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder,
baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Stir
in the milk, garlic, jalape¤o peppers and remaining oil.

Pour the milk mixture into the cornmeal mixture, add the remaining
green onions, cheese and sausage and stir just until the dry
ingredients are moistened, about 1 minute.

Carefully remove the preheated pan from the oven. Pour in the batter,
spreading evenly; the depth of the batter will be quite thin. Sprinkle
evenly with reserved green onion mixture. Bake until golden brown,
about 15 minutes.

Remove the cornbread from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Use a
serrated knife to cut the cornbread into 24 fingers (3 3/4 x 1 1/4
inches), cutting 8 strips lengthwise and 4 strips crosswise. Serve
warm.

The cornsticks may be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To
recrisp, arrange the sticks 1 inch apart, on 2 large baking sheets.
Bake in a preheated 425øF oven until crisp and lightly browned, 5 to
10 minutes.
