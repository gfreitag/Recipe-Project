Cut meat in thin slices. Meat is easier to cut when partially frozen
and it will cut evenly. Combine salt, peppers, meat tenderizers,
seasoned salt, accent, garlic and onion powders, kitchen bouquet,
morton tender quick, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, barbecue sauce
and liquid smoke. Marinate meat in sauce for 24 hours in a sealable
plastic bag. Place meat directly on oven racks, line bottom of oven
with foil, or on rack in shallow pan and dry in oven for 6-8 hours on
lowest setting. Continue to dry in warm oven if necessary. Oven's
with pilot lights work especially well.
