Cream
Saute garlic, onion, green pepper, celery, and corn in a dollop of
vinegar for 10-15 minutes. Add more vinegar if necessary to keep from
sticking. Add the rest of the ingredients, stirring the cornstarch
into the tomato sauce first. Bring mixture to a boil and spoon into a
9X13 baking pan sprayed with Pam.

For the crust topping combine the cornmeal, flour and baking powder.
Mix well.

Combine water, oil and chilies and stir into dry mixture.  Spoon onto
the filling.  Bake uncovered 30 minutes at 350F.

After baking, top with low-fat vanillia yogurt dollops and chopped
tomato.

Enjoy.
