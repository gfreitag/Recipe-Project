Title: Asian Millet Salad
Categories: Fatfree, Asian, Salad
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Frozen peas, thawed
1    Clove garlic, minced
1    8-oz  can sliced water
Chestnuts
1 t  Sugar (or other sweetener)
1/2 c  Chopped scallion
2 c  Cooked millet
6 T  Mirin or dry sherry
1    10-oz  package of tofu,
Diced
3 T  Soy sauce
3/4 c  Chopped snow peas
1 1/2 T  Rice or cider vinegar
In a large bowl, combine the millet, tofu, snow peas, peas, water
chestnuts, and scallion.

In a small bowl, stir together the mirin, soy sauce, venegar, garlic,
and sugar.  Pour over the salad and toss to combine.

Although the original recipes didn't say to, I let both of these
salads chill for awhile to let the flavors blend before I served
them. I think that this step is a particularly good idea for the
Asian Millet salad, as it allows the tofu to absorb the flavors of
the dressing. If you try these, I hope you enjoy them as much as I
did!
