1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Dry milk powder

*Rice polish (also known as rice bran) is ground from the outer
coating of the rice grain.  It is an excellent source of the B
vitamin niacin. It also contains fiber, protein, minerals, and
practically no sodium. It too has a slightly bitter taste, so use it
sparingly.

In food processor, blender or mixing bowl, combine oil, molasses, egg
and vanilla.  Blend until smooth and creamy.  Add carrots, and blend.

Combine the wheat flour, wheat germ, bran, rice polish or soy flour,
baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, and milk powder.  Add
to the carrot mixture.  Blend briefly until incorporated.  Stir in
the raisins and the oats.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls onto a cookie sheet lined with
parchment paper or greased with a mixture of liquid lecithin and oil.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes.
