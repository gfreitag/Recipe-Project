very,very to the concept of ff/vlf living. I am at the very very
beginning stages of the transition from SAD to VLF and would like
information on vegetarian/vegan restaurants in the Houston area.
Right now with my work schedule and such I don't even have time to
cook much--we all know eating out consistently in the SAD world is
deadly for the experienced, and I'm a total novice.

Maybe this will help, I got it off of the rec.food.veg news group
concerning the World Guide to Vegetarianism a directory of every
restaurant that they know about that is vegetarian or serves any
vegetarian dishes and it includes some specific info about what they
serve:
