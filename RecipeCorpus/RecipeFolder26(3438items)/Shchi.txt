Saute onion, leek, carrots, celery, and turnip in bacon fat in a large
kettle. Add beef bouillon and bring to boil. Stir in cabbage and
tomato paste and reduce heat. Cook slowly, covered, for about 1 hour,
or until vegetables are cooked. Sprinkle with chopped dill or
parsley. Serves 6-8. NOTE: After the soup is cooked, thicken with
flour browned in butter, if desired. Potatoes, peeled and cubed, may
be added about 20 mins before the soup is finished cooking.

NOTES:  In Russia soups are basic foods, ranking in importance after
breads and grains.  The most common is made with cabbage and
:
is
called shchi, or s'chee.  It is particularly favored because
:
it
does not require a meat base.  During the summer the soup is
:
made
from fresh cabbage and called "lazy"; while during the winter,
sauerkraut is used, and the name is changed to "sour".  All
:
:
the
kinds of shchi are hearty dishes and are rich in vitamins.
:
The
ingredients usually include whatever is no hand,  Beef,
:
sausages,
and smoked pork add further sustenance to some of the cabbage
soups.  Shchi can be served with kasha and garnished with sour
cream.  This is one variation.
