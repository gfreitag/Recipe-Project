Title: Pairing and Preparing and Beans and Grains
Categories: Information, Beans, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 info  When pairing beans and grains, consider contrasting and complementary
characteristics. For example, grains like spelt and Kamut are large
and chewy and provide a nice contrast to lentils, which are small and
firm. Use two or more kinds of beans for visual effect. If you have
an ingredient that isn't exactly what's called for ÄÄ say red beans
rather than black ones or barley rather than wheat berries ÄÄ
improvise.

To prepare dried beans and grains, sort through them, picking out any
stones, chaff or broken beans. Rinse thoroughly to wash off any dust.

Most dried beans should be soaked before cooking (split peas and
lentils are exceptions). Soaking returns moisture to the beans,
softens them, prevents their skins from splitting, and reduces
cooking time. It also draws out the indigestible sugars that cause
intestinal gas. Do not add salt to the soaking liquid. It toughens
the beans.

Soak sturdy whole grains such as spelt, Kamut and wheat berries to
speed up cooking time.

Cook more beans and grains than you need for one recipe. You can
refrigerate leftovers in a tightly covered container for about 4 days
and freeze them for up to 6 months.
