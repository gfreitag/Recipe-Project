Title: Simplest Nachos (Vegan)
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
Diced red bell pepper, fresh
Or roasted
x  Whatever else seems good to
You (my husband opted for
Olives)
1 1/2 c  Cook white beans
Tomatoes, finely chopped
Canned mild or green
Chilies
Canned hot jalapeno chilies
Onion, finely chopped
Fill a big bowl with BAKED TOSTITOS.  Provide everyone with a butter
knife to spread the beans onto the chips, and add toppings as
desired.  If you feel Nachos must have cheese, then you have to
spread beans on each chip, arrange them on a cookie sheet and
sprinkle the other ingredients, including shredded FF cheese, over
them.  Bake at 350 just till cheese is melted.  But try it the other
way first.  Very tasty, everyone gets the toppings they prefer, and
the chips stay CRISP!
