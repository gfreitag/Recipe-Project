In a heavy saucepan bring 1 cup buckwheat honey to a boil and stir in
1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon each of ground ginger and nutmeg,
and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. Add 1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda and
let the mixture cool. In a bowl cream together 3/4 stick or 6
tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar and add
4 egg yolks, one at a time, and the honey mixture. Into another bowl
sift together 2 cups flour, 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder, and 1/4
teaspoon salt and sift the mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, into the honey
mixture. In a small bowl combine 3/4 cup each of raisins and chopped
toasted blanched almonds and 1/2 cup dried currants, toss the mixture
with 1/4 cup flour, and add it to the batter. In another bowl beat 4
egg whites until they hold stiff peaks, fold one-fourth of them
lightly into the batter, and fold in the remaining egg whites. Line 2
buttered loaf tins, 7 1/2 by 3 1/2 by 2 inches, with buttered sheets
of brown paper and pour the batter into the tins. Decorate the tops
with halved blanched almonds and bake the loaves in a preheated
moderately slow oven (325-F.) for 1 hour. Turn the loaves out on a
rack and let them cool. The loaves will keep for 3 to 4 weeks,
tightly wrapped.
