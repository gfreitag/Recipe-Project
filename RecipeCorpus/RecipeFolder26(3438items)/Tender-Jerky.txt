Begin preparation by deboning and removing the tendons and fat from
the meat. It is important that you remove all fat or it will go
rancid.  Either grind the meat yourself or have someone grind it for
you; a coarse grind gives the best results. Mix the spices thoroughly
and then add the spices a bit at a time while kneading the meat like
dough. Put the meat in the fridge for at least 6 hours to allow the
spices to work through the meat. At this point you prepare the meat
for jerking.  If you have an electric meat slicer, make the meat into
logs about 4  14"; place the meat in the fridge until it is solid but
not frozen, and then slice 1/8" slices from end to end.  You'll end
up with a big stack of circular patties.  If you don't have a slicer,
roll the meat out to a 1/8" thickness between two pieces of wax
paper.  Remove the top paper and score the meat into strips and
place them in the freezer for about 45 minutes.  Remove the meat and
break at the score marks. Place the jerky on wire racks and place
them in a 150 F. oven, leaving the door slightly ajar so moisture can
escape and the heat does not build up. Turn the jerky once or twice
during drying and rotate the racks if the jerky near the elements
begins to dry too fast. Meat should be left slightly pliable, that
should take somewhere around 3 or 4 hours to get to.  Cure yours to
whatever point you like; if you like potato chips, be my guest. Jerky
can can be stored for months in the freezer; the drier it is the
longer it will keep.
