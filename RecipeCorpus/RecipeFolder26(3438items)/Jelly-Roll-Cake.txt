Title: Jelly Roll Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Sifted cake flour
4 ea Eggs
(I use regular flour, with just a bit less than 3/4 cup) 1 tsp baking
powder 1/2 tsp salt (optional) 3/4 cup white sugar (granulated) 1 cup
raspberry or other preserves confectioner's sugar Let eggs warm to
room temperature in small bowl of electric mixer, for about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400F.  Lightly gread bottom of jelly roll pan,
thenline bottom of pan with waxed paper.  Sift flour with baking
powder and salt, set aside. On high speed, beat eggs until ver thick
and lemon colored. Beat in the granulated sugar, 2 tbsp at a time.
Continue beating for 5 more minutes, or until very thick.  With
Rubber spatula, gently foldin ;the flour mixture just until combined.
Turn onto the waxed paper, gently spreading until even.  Bake for
9-14 minutes, or until it gently springs back when pressed with
finger. Remove from oven. Sift confectioner's sugar over the top of
cake, lay clean tea towel over cake and turn over onto counter.
Remove pan, and gently peel off wax paper. Roll cake lengthwise along
with towel until you have a long 'roll'.  Allow to sit on the seam
and let cool, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Unroll cake, spread jam or
jelly of your own choice and roll back up without towel.  Wrap in
plastic wrap and store in fridge for up to 4-5 days, or freeze. ** I
have also used chocolate pudding as a filling. It's very nice. Stays
very moist when using a pudding.. just make sure it's spread thin or
it oozes out as you are rolling. ** Origin: My recipe file Shared by:
