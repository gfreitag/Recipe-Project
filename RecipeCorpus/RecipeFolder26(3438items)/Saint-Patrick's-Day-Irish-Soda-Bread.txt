Cut this crusty bread in wedges to serve.  Add two teaspoons grate
lemon peel to complement the flavor of the currants. 4 cups
unbleached flour 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp baking powder 1 tsp baking soda
1/4 cup sugar 1/8 tsp cardamom 1/4 cup butter 1 egg, at room
temperature 1-3/4 cup buttermilk, at room temperature 1-1/2 cups
currants In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients.  Cut in
the butter with a pastry blender or work it in with your finger.  Mix
the egg and buttermilk together and then add this mixture to the dry
ingredients. Stir until well blended. Add the currants and stir the
mixture well. Turn out on a floured surface and knead gently for 3
minutes or until the dough is smooth. Divide the dough into two
pieces, shaping each into a round loaf. Place each in a greased 8
inch cake or pie pan, pressing it down until the dough fills the pan.
Use a sharp knife to cut a 1/2 inch deep cross on top of each loaf.
Bake in a preheated 375F oven for about 40 minutes or until the bread
sounds hollow when you thump it.  Turn out on a wire rack to cool.
Do not cut for about 4 hours.
