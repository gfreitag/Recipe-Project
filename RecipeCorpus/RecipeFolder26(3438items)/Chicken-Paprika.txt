Wash chickens and wipe dry. Heat lard in a large skillet; fry chicken
pieces on both sides until golden. Remove as cooked and keep warm.
When all pieces are cooked, pour off almost all fat; add onions and
garlic. Saute until tender. Stir in paprika; cook 1 min. Mix in
chicken broth; bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper; return
chicken pieces to skillet. Cook slowly, covered, until chicken is
tender. Add more broth during cooking, if needed. Remove to a warm
platter. Combine flour and sour cream; mix into the skillet. Cook
slowly, stirring, until thickened and smooth. Return chicken pieces
to sauce; leave on stove long enough to heat through. Serves 8.

NOTES : One of the glories of the Hungarian cuisine is the well-known
csirke paprikas, which is made in many variations. The most
typical kind is prepared only with chicken, flavorings and sour
cream. Tomatoes and green peppers are optional additions.
