A simple fat free delicious onion soup that was altered to nonfat
from the original recipe.  For a richer soup, you may add 4T butter
and use regular cheese in hot soup.  The nutritional analysis does
not reflect the changes. In a large non stick skillet saute half the
onions until they are a deep brown but not burned. The trick is to
cook them until they are well browned and tender yet still have a
little firmness. Add a little water at a time to keep onions from
sticking. If you have chosen to use butter then you can saute the
onions in butter. Repeat with remaining onions. In a 3-4 qt pot place
all the sauteed onions the garlic & water. Bring to a boil reduce
heat and simmer covered about 20 min or until soup broth is quite
flavorful. Turn burner to lowest heat. Add tamari and vegetable broth
powder. Add a little more water if desired.
Serve hot topped with cheese & croutons or French bread. The
