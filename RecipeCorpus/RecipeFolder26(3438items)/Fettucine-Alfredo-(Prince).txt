1 c  Parmesan, grated
1/2 t  Salt
ds Pepper, white
Cheese, romano
12 oz Pasta, fettuccine
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Whipping cream or half &
-half
We add a little romano to this for extra flavor- not in the original
recipe- about 1 or 2 tablespoons. I also reduced the Parmesan from the
original recipe which called for 1 1/2 cups. This large an amount
doesn't combine well with the cream. Cook fettuccine according to
package directions.  While fettuccine cooks, heat butter or margarine
and cream in a small sauce pan until butter melts. (My notes: last
time I made this, I started the sauce too early and let the butter
and cream sit over very low heat for about a half an hour. Jim said
it was the best I'd made yet! I think the trick is to reduce the
cream a bit before adding the cheese. Simmering for about 10 minutes
would probably turn out the same.) Stir in parmesan cheese., salt and
pepper.  Keep warm over low heat. Drain fettuccine, return to pan,
pour sauce over noodles, toss gently until noodles are well coated.
