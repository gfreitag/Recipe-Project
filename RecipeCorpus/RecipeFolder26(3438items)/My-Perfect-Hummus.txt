Title: My Perfect Hummus
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Spread
Yield: 1 servings
Mild spicing, more for
Serious heat
4 T  Cilantro (variable,
Depending on your taste for
Greens)
2 cn Chick peas (I use S & W
Brand)
2 T  Lemon juice (or a bit more,
If you like lemony hummus)
x  Few drops Tabasco sauce for
Drain one can of chick peas completely, the other one such that some
liquid is left. Put into bowl. Add lemon juice. Mince and add
cilantro and add Tabasco sauce. Blend until smooth. If hummus is not
soft and creamy, then you did not leave enough liquid with the chick
peas. Add some water or lemon juice to make up for it. Serve with
crackers or use as a spread on Whole Wheat bread.
