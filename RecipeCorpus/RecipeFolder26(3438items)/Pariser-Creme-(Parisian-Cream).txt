Categories: Viennese, Chocolate, Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
Despite its name, this has been a very Viennese recipe for
generations. It is often used in preference to Chocolate Whipped
Cream because, being stirred instead of whipped, it has a velvety
rather than an airy texture - perfect for many tortes (spongecakes or
Almond-Chocolate Torte, for instance) and small cakes. 1 pint heavy
cream 16 oz semisweet chocolate, unmelted 2 - 3 Tbsp powdered vanilla
sugar

Heat cream and solid chocolate in saucepan over low flame, stirring
constantly with metal spatula or wire whisk, until chocolate has
melted completely into cream and mixture begins to simmer and thicken
(look for a large, single, gentle bubble). Remove saucepan from stove
before mixture comes to a true simmer, and continue stirring or
whisking until mixture is cool.  Stir in sugar to taste. Chill to
spreading consistency. Makes frosting and 1-layer filling for 8-inch
torte or filling and frosting for roulade. From: THE ART OF VIENNESE
