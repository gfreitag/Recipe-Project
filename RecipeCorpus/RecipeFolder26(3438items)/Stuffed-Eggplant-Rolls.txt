MMMMM----------------ABOUT 45 MINUTES BEFORE SERV---------------------
Preheat the broiler (if oven manufacturer directs).  Spray a large
cookie sheet with nonstick cooking spray.

Cut the eggplant lengthwise into twelve 1/8-inch thick slices.
Arrange as many slices as possible in one layer on the cookie sheet.
Broil, turning once, for about 6 minutes, until the eggplant is
tender and lightly browned on both sides.  Repeat with the remaining
eggplant slices. Set the oven control to 400F.

Meanwhile, mix the spinach, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese,
oregano and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a small bowl. Place a nonstick
10-inch skillet over medium heat and add the salad oil and 2
tablespoons of water. Cook the onion until tender and lightly
browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, sugar, crushed red pepper, 1/4
teaspoon of salt and 1 cup of water. Heat to the boil over high heat.

Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Starting along the narrow end of an eggplant slice,
evenly spoon about 2 rounded tablespoons of the spinach-cheese
mixture in a 1/2-inch wide strip. Roll the eggplant slice jellyroll
fashion.  Repeat with the remaining eggplant slices and
spinach-cheese mixture.

Place the eggplant rolls, seam-side down, in a shallow 3-quart
casserole or a 13-by-9-inch glass baking dish.  Top with the tomato
sauce mixture. Sprinkle evenly with the Parmesan cheese.  Bake for 15
minutes, until heated through.
