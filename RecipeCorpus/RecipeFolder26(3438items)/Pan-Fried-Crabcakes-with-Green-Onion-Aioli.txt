Stir together the sour cream, egg, garlic, pepper, curry powder, chile

gently to combine. Form into 12 patties about 2« inches across and
3/4 inch thick and coat with breadcrumbs, shaking off excess.

Heat half the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
half the crab cakes and saut until golden brown, about 1« minutes
per side. Repeat with remaining olive oil and crab cakes. Arrange the
salad greens on individual plates, top with the crab cakes and pass
the Green Onion Aioli.

Green Onion Aioli:

Combine the garlic, egg yolk, jalape¤o, rice vinegar and green onions
in a food processor and process 2 to 3 minutes. With the motor
running, slowly add the olive oil in a thin stream; the mixture will
thicken and emulsify to make a mayonnaise. Add salt and pepper to
taste.

Makes about 1 cup.

Note: as a alternative, omit the egg yolk and olive oil and add the
remaining ingredients to 1 cup prepared mayonnaise.
