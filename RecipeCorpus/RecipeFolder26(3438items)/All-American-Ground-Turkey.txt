2 c  Sour cream
2 c  Chopped tomatoes

1.  Heat the oil in a large frying pan set over medium-high heat. Add
the onions and garlic and stir until the onions are wilted, about 5
minutes. Add the turkey and cook, stirring occasionally to break up
any chunks, until browned thoroughly, about 10 minutes.  Add the
corn, 3 to 6 tablespoons of the Fresh Tomato Salsa or Salsa Verde,
the wine and salt. Cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed,
10 to 15 minutes

2.  To assemble, spread about 1/3 cup of the turkey filling in the
middle of a tortilla.  Top with some of the remaining salsa, chopped
tomatoes, shredded lettuce, cheese and sour cream.  Fold and serve.

TIPS *You can also make these tacos with leftover holiday turkey. Use
about 6 cups diced roasted turkey meat and add a little extra wine
for more moisture. *Turkey tends to dry out easily, so when reheating
this filling, add a little more wine or some water.
