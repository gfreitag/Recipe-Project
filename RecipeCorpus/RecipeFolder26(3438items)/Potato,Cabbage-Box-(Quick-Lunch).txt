Title: Potato/Cabbage Box (Quick Lunch)
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Potato, Mushroom
Yield: 1 servings
x  Salt
x  Black pepper
x  Paprika
1/2    Cabbage chopped coarsly
2 sm Potatoes
1    Dozen or more mushrooms
2 T  Minced chives
Layer into lunch box in this order. Do not mix. Mix at work and nuke
for 10 minutes on high.

Option: I would think this would be good with some caraway seed or
Oregano added. I could also imagine using 2 teaspoons of sweet curry
instead of the pepper and paprika.
