No Ingredients Found
When I was supervisor at a group home for the Mentally Handicapped,
one of my staff brought this recipe in and made it during night
shift.  It was such a hit by both staff and clients, that it was made
every week from then on. This is the best muffin recipe I have found.
The mixture will keep in the fridge for a while if you don't want to
make up the whole batch at once. 3 cups bran 1 cup boiling water
2-1/2 cups flour 2-1/2 cups buttermilk 2-1/2 tsp baking soda 1 tsp
salt 1/2 cup shortening 1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed 2 eggs 1 cup
raisins 1 cup crushed pineapple, drained 1 cup mandarin slices,
drained 1 cup coconut

Pour boiling water over 1 cup of the bran.  Set aside to cool.  Cream
together sugar and margarine.  Add eggs.  Beat well.  Add milk and
soda, then flour, bran (both hot and dry) and the fruits.  Mix
thoroughly. Cover and let stand overnight in fridge.  Will keep up to
three weeks. Do not stir.  Scoop out enough for muffin tins and bake
at 400F for 30 minutes or until done.  Because the mixture stays well
in the fridge, you can bake these fresh when you want them. Origin:
