Title: Kfc Coleslaw (Ts)
Categories: Salad, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/4 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 T  White vinegar
2 1/2 T  Lemon juice
8 c  Finely chopped cabbage
(1 head)
1/4 c  Shredded carrot (1 medium)
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 t  Salt
1/8 t  Pepper
Be sure that the cabbage and carrots are chopped up into very fine
pieces (about the size of rice kernels).  Combine the sugar, salt,
pepper, milk, mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, and lemon juice, and
beat until smooth. Add the cabbage and carrots and mix well. Cover
and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Note: The
critical part of this coleslaw is the flavor- enhancement period
prior to eating. Be absolutely certain the coleslaw sits in the
refrigerator for at least a couple of hours prior to serving for a
great-tasting slew of slaw. Serves: 8 From: "Top Secret Recipes"
