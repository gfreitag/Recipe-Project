Recipe by: Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle Stop Cafe Cookbook Remove
corn husks, breaking off stems. Remove silks with a stiff vegetable
brush, and wash ears in cold water. To cut kernals from cob, hold
corn in a large shallow bowl or dish with one hand and use a very
sharp knife to cut off a thin layer from tops of kernals. Then cut
down cob again one or 2 times, scraping remaining parts of kernals
and juices into bowl. Stir in milk, water and sugar. Heat bacon
drippings in a large heavy skillet (cast iron preferred) over medium
heat; add corn mixture, and cook 10 to 12 mins, stirring often.
Remove from heat and stir in salt and pepper to taste. YIELD: 4 to 6
servings

NOTE: Starches from fresh-picked summer corn will thicken this dish
as it cooks. If the cooked corn is not thickened, mix 2 tsp flour and
2 Tbs water until smooth; stir into skillet. Cook, stirring
constantly, just until thickened.

VARIATION: If fresh corn is not available, use one 1-lb bag (2 1/2
cups) frozen, thawed white shoepeg corn. Combine corn, 1/2 cup milk,
1/2 cup water and 1 tsp sugar in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook
5 mins. Remove from heat; measure out 1 1/2 cups of corn and 1/2 cup
of liquid. Add 1 Tbs all-purpose flour to corn mixture; process in an
electric blender until coarsely pureed. Return to saucepan, and stir
in 1 to 2 Tbs bacon drippings, if desired. Cook over medium heat 5
mins, stirring often. Remove from heat, and stir in salt and pepper
to taste. YIELD: 4 to 6 servings
