1 lb Ground beef;
8 oz (1)jar mild taco sauce;
1 cn (16 oz) refried beans;*
Prepare tortillas and keep warm.  In medium bowl, mix well ground
beef and 1/3 cup taco sauce.  Shape beef mixture into 6 5" round
patties. In same skillet over high heat, cook patties 4 minutes or
until doneness, turning once; keep warm.  In a 1 quart saucepan over
medium heat, heat refried beans; keep warm.  In 10" skillet heat oil,
fry eggs, 3 at time, until yolks are desired firmness, remove from
skillet; sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste; keep warm.  To
serve, place tortilla on plate; spread some refried beans, top with
some of the shredded lettuce, then beef patty. Pour some taco sauce
over patty, top with an egg, then some shredded cheese. Repeat with
remaining ingredients. This is a real south-of-the-border-style
hamburger with all the trimmings! NOTE: I heat tortilla in the
toaster oven, would use black beans and would not use the eggs, maybe.
