water to remove starch on outside of grains. Drain in sieve. Put

rice clings to sides of pan, scrape down). Cover pan++now you won't
lift lid till rice is done. Bring to vigorous boil over high heat.

cook 5 minutes while gradually turning heat down. Continue to cook 15
minutes. Remove from heat. Keep pan covered and let steam 7 minutes.
