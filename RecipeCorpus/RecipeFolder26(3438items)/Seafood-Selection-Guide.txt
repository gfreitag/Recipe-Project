Cooking Times

Cooking time for fish is generally 8 to 12 minutes per inch of
thickness, regardless of method (bake, broil, grill, pan fry, poach),
except for microwave

As fish, shrimp, scallops, lobster and crab cook, their flesh turns
from a moist translucent color to opaque or solid in color.

Live mussels, clams and oysters pop open when cooked; shucked oysters
firm slightly and their edges curl.
