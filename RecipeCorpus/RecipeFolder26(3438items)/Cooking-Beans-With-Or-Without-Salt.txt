Title: Cooking Beans With Or Without Salt

Michele is right on target about salt making most beans tough.  Keep
in mind that the reverse is true - if you are trying to keep the more
tender beans from disintegrating, add salt to the cooking water. I
always cook dried lima beans in salted water. Several veg. cookbooks
have excellent tips on handling beans and dealing with problems -
Laurel's Kitchen and Lorna Sass' Cooking in an Ecological Kitchen (or
maybe From an Ecological Kitchen, I can't remember) come to mind
immediately.
