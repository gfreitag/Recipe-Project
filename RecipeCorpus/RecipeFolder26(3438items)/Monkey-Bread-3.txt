Title: Monkey Bread 3
Categories: Bread
Yield: 24 servings
1 T  Reduced-calorie stick
-margarine
1 3/4 t  Ground cinnamon, divided
Vegetable cooking spray
2 ea Loaves frozen white bread
-dough (1 pound each)
1 1/4 c  Sugar, divided
1/4 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 c  1% low-fat milk
Thaw the dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours.  Coat a 12-cup Bundt
pan with cooking spray.

Combine 1 cup of the sugar with the brown sugar, milk, margarine and
1 1/4 teaspoons of the cinnamon in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil
and cook for 1 minute.  Remove the sugar syrup from the heat and let
cool for 10 minutes.

Cut each loaf of dough into 24 equal portions.  Combine the remaining
1/4 cup of sugar with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in a
shallow dish and stir well.  Roll each portion of dough in the sugar
mixture and layer the dough in the prepared Bundt pan.  Pour the
sugar syrup over the dough. Cover and let rise in a warm (85F), draft
free place for 35 minutes, until doubled in bulk.

Uncover and bake at 350F until lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
Immediately loosen the edges of the bread from the pan with a knife.
Place a serving plate, upside down, on top of the pan.  Invert the
bread onto the plate.  Remove the pan and drizzle any remaining syrup
over the bread.

NOTE:  "Because the dough has a tendency to drip as it bakes, I
usually put a cookie sheet or aluminum foil underneath the Bundt pan.
That way I don't have to clean up a mess in the oven when the bread
has finished baking."
