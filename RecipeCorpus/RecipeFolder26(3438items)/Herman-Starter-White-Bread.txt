makes two 9x5 inch loaves

1.  In a wide saucepan, combine the milk, shortening, sugar, and salt.
Place over medium heat and stir until the shortening is melted.
Transfer to a large mixing bowl to cool.

2.  When the mixture is barely warm to the touch, stir in the
dissolved yeast.  Blend in the sourdough starter.  Add 2 cups of the
flour and beat with a spoon until smooth.  Gradually blend in
additional flour until the dough becomes too difficult to stir.  turn
out onto a floured surface and knead in as much of the remaining
flour as necessary to form a cohesive dough.  Continue kneading in
flour until the dough is soft yet no longer sticks to the work
surface. Transfer to a greased bowl and cover with a clean kitchen
towel. Set aside to rise until double in bulk.

3.  Generously grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.  Punch the dough down,
then turn it out onto a floured surface.  Shape it into 2 loaves and
place them in the prepared pans.  Cover and set aside to rise.  When
double in bulk, bake in a preheated 375 oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or
until the crust is nicely browned.  Cool on a rack for 5 minutes,
then turn out. Complete cooling on the rack.
