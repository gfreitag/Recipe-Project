Title: Dinner Rolls
Categories: Breadmaker, Bread
Yield: 12 rolls
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Butter
2 ts Yeast
5 oz Warm milk
1    Egg, room temp.
2 c  Bread flour
1/4 c  Sugar
Add all ingredients to breadmaker and use dough cycle.  When done,
about 1 hour 20 minutes on my machine, place dough in buttered bowl
and let rest for about 20 minutes.  I placed it in the oven with the
light on and covered it with a damp towel. Turn the bowl over and
press the gases out of the dough.  Roll into 12 balls and let rest
for 10 minutes. Now flatten each ball out with the palm of your hand
into a rectangle. Now roll up, fold over, pinch ends together and
place pinched side down into muffin tin which has beensprayed with
Pam. When done, spritz with water and place in oven with light on for
at least 30 minutes. Bake on 350 f. for about 15 minutes or until
golden brown.

Serve immediately. They don't need any more butter, but go ahead,
splurge. Submitted By HENRY KASTEN   On   12-26-94
