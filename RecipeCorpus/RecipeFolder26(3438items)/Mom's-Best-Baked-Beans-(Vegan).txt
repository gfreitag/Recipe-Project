This is a wonderful recipe that I got from a cookbook called Lean
Luscious & meatless.  It takes a little bit of time to prepare but is
well worth the effort. It is the best baked beans I have ever had.
You can substitute baby limas for the navy beans. I have changed a
few things from the original recipe to suit my own taste so feel free
to add any of your favorite seasonings. Rinse & drain beans. Place in
a large bowl with remaining ingredients except tomato sauce. Mix well
cover & place in the refigerator for 24 hours. TO COOK: Transfer bean
mixture to a large oven proof pot. Add tomato sauce. Bring to a boil
over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover & simmer 45 min stirring
occassionally. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place pot in oven. bake 4
hours covered. Check beans every half hour or so adding water and
stirring as needed. When beans are done to your likeness remove from
oven and serve. : Nutrition (per serving): 283 calories Total Fat 1 g
