Comment from Sally: Pico de gallo (pee-coh day guy-yoh) translates as
the Bite of the Rooster. I assume that is because the salsa (which
merely means "sauce") called pico de gallo is quite fiery and has a
fierce bite to it. Having never been bitten by a rooster, however, I
can only offer this as conjecture. (grin)
