Title: Basic White Bread (Barry's)
Categories: Breadmaker, Bread
Yield: 1 loaf
4 c  Bread flour
2 t  Salt
2 T  Butter
7/8 c  Water
3/4 c  Milk
4 1/2 T  Sugar
1 3/4 t  Yeast
Watch dough ball.  7/8 water and 3/4 milk makes a good, firm, satiny,
ball that rises nicely over the top of the pan but not to the top of
the machine.

I use hot water and cold milk so the liquid is lukewarm. Put water
and milk in bottom of bread pan add sugar, stir, add yeast, stir.
Add 2 cups of flour, then salt and butter, then remaining two cups of
flour.  Set machine on regular bread cycle.

When using this recipe for time delay baking cut the yeast to 1 1/2 t
and put on top of flour.
