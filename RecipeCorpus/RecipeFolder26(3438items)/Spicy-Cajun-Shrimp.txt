NOTE:
"For havin' some fun down on the bayou, try this shrimp dish sparked
with cayenne and aromatic herbs.  Traditionally, the shrimp are
cooked unpeeled and then shelled at the table.  If this seems too
messy, shelled shrimp may be used.  The sauce is spicy, but you can
reduce the amount of cayenne and the sauce will still be fine.  And
if the shrimp is going to be peeled at the table, don't forget the
napkins." [Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home; The Moosewood
