Title: ROMANIAN SAUSAGES (MITITEI)
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Dried thyme, whole
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/2 c  Beef stock
5    Cloves garlic, peeled
1/4 c  Water
1 lb Ground chuck
2/3 lb Coarsely ground pork
1 ts Baking soda
Crush the garlic well in the water, using a fork. Stir the meat,
baking soda, seasonings, and garlic puree together. Add Beef Stock
and mix well. For each sausage, take 1/3 cup of the meat mixture, and
roll between the palms of your hands into a sausage shape about 4
inches long. Place sausages side by side in a container and cover.
Refrigerate overnight so that the flavors can blend.
These are excellent on the grill. They may also be broiled or baked
in the oven. Broil the sausages about 3 minutes per side until cooked
through and browned..
HINT: When hand rolling sausages or meatballs of any kind, keep a
small bowl of water near you so that you can keep your hands a bit
wet. This way the meat will not stick to your hands.
