Herb Sauce

1/2 pint light cream
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 tsp Dijon mustard
Lemon juice
2 shallots
1 Tb chervil and tarragon
2 oz. butter
1 tsp plain flour

Cook the shallots very gently until the onions are clear and soft but
not brown.  Next add the teaspoon of flour, 1/2 pint of cream, salt
and pepper to taste and the teaspoon of Dijon mustard.  Cook very
gently (in a double boiler if available; a pan will do, but be very
careful not to burn) for approx. 10 minutes.  Then beat in 2 egg
yolks until the mix- ture thickens.  Finally add a squeeze of lemon
juice.  Place the fish on a serving dish and put the sauce in a sauce
boat for the guests to help themselves.  The fish can be sliced into
6 portions.
