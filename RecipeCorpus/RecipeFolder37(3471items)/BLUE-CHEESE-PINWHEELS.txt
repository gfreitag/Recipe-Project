Title: BLUE-CHEESE PINWHEELS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 36 servings
4 tb Buter, softened
6 sl Soft white bread
1/4 lb Blue cheese (room temp)
1/2 c  Minced parsley
In small bowl, mix blue cheese, 1/4 c minced parsley, and 2 tbsp
butter until well blended.

Trim crusts from bread slices; reserve bread trimmings for making
crumbs another day.  With rolling pin, roll bread slices flat. Evenly
spread about 1 rounded tablespoonful cheese mixture on each bread
slice; roll up, jelly-roll fashion.

On waxed paper, place remaining 1/4 cup minced parsley.  Spread
outside of cheese rolls with remaining butter; coat lightly with
parsley. Wrap rolls tightly in plastic wrap; refigerate at least 30
minutes for easier slicing.

To serve, slice each parsley-coated cheese roll crosswise into six
slices. Place slices, cut-side up, on platter.  Makes 3 dozen hors
d'oeuvres.
