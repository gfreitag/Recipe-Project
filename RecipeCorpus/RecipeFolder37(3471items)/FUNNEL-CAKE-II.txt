It is hard to know if this should really be called a cake, but it has
historically been called a cake, so it is a cake, even if it is
fried. This desert appeals to children of all ages, it is a homey,
and homely, classic ~ attractive in its own strange way, and very
tasty. I have seen it served with whipped cream and fruit toppings,
so let your imagination run wild with the toppings. This is a
Pennsylvania-Dutch recipe, and was printed in the food section of the
September 25, 1986 Austin American-Statesman. This recipe was
credited to Laura Worm, Louise Lightsey, and Jeanene Demel.

INGREDIENT LIST

Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ones.  Beat until smooth.

Fill a skillet or pan with 1 inch of cooking oil and heat to a
temperature of 375 F.  Now cover the small hole of a clean funnel
with a finger. Then fill the funnel with the batter. Carefully move
your finger away from the hole in the funnel, allowing the batter to
flow into the skillet. Move the funnel to form patterns with the
batter. Fry until golden brown, about 1 or 2 minutes, turning once
with two spatulas. Remove to paper toweling to drain.  Place on a
plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve hot. Repeat the process
until all of the batter is used up.
