Title: PASTA W/RED PEPPERS, GREENS, BEANS, GARLIC & LEMON ZEST
Categories: Low cal/fat, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
-- washed well and cut
-- into 1/2-inch strips
1 tb Grated lemon zest
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 lb Penne pasta; uncooked
1/4 lb Farfalle pasta; uncooked
1/2 c  White beans
-- soaked in water overnight
1    Bay leaf
4    Garlic cloves; peeled
1/3 c  Vegetable stock
2    Red bell peppers
-- cut into 1/2-inch strips
4 c  Swiss chard or escarole
Rinse the beans, put them in a saucepan, and cover with 2 cups cold
water. Add the bay leaf and 2 cloves of garlic and bring to a boil
over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 45 to 60
minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat.

Bring the vegetable stock to a simmer in a saute pan over moderate
heat. Add the pepper strips and simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, then add
the greens, 2 cloves of garlic that have been minced, and lemon zest
and stir well, until the greens are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain
the beans (most of the liquid will have been absorbed) from the
cooking liquid with a slotted spoon and add them to the peppers and
greens.  Warm through.  Season to taste with the salt, pepper, and
lemon juice.

Meantime, cook the pasta according to the package directions.  Drain
and toss with the beans and vegetables.
