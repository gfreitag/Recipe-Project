Title: Basic Panfried Lake Trout Fillets -2
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
Vegetable oil ***
Lemon wedges
1 1/2 lb Lake trout fillet; *
1/3 c  Flour; all-purpose
1 1/2 ts Mixed seasonings**
* The individual portions to be pan fried should be 1/4" to 1/2"
thick. Slice a skinless fillet from head to tail horizontally to make
thinner fillets, then cut vertically into individual portions.

** Your choice of salt, black or white pepper, cayenne/chili
powder/paprika/cajun spice mix, garlic powder and a variety of green
herbs: dried parsley, tarragon, marjoram, basil, thyme, chevril,
dill, etc.

For an oriental flavor try minced garlic and grated ginger root; use
veg oil not butter or bacon fat and add a dash of soy sauce towards
the end.

*** Don't use pure butter as it will burn and blacken. A mixture of
butter and veg. oil gives a nice flavor or use margarine or bacon fat.

Wash the fillets and pat dry. Lightly dredge each fillet portion in
flour. This is optional.

Heat a little veg oil, margarine or bacon fat in a non-stick skillet.
Add your choice of seasonings and cook stirring 1 min. Fry the
fillets in the flavored hot oil over medium heat until browned. Drain
on absorbent paper. Keep warm, uncovered, on cookie sheets in a low
oven [250 F] until all the fish is fried and ready for serving.

Serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing juice at the table
or a sauce.

The same technique works for steaks just as well. Use steaks 3/4"
to 1" thick and increase cooking time accordingly.
