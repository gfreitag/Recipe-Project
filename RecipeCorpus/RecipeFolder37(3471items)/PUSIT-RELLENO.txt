Categories: Tex/mexican, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM----------------------STUFFED CALAMARI---------------------------
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 md Onion, chopped
1 md Tomato, chopped
1/2    Bay leaf
1 tb Soy sauce
12 lg Squids
1/2 lb Ground pork
3    Green onions, finely sliced
1    Egg, beaten
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Garlic clove, minced
Remove squid heads and ink sacs, clean the calamari outside and
inside. Sprinkle salt lightly on squids and set aside.
In a large bowl combine ground pork, green onions, beaten egg and a
little salt and pepper.
Stuff squid cavities with meat mixture. This is messy and slippery,
don't over stuff the calamari as the stuffing will swell when
cooking. A pastry bag makes this easier to do.
Place a pan in a steamer and steam the calamari covered for 10-15
minutes, or until filling is cooked. Drain liquid and set aside.
Prepare sauce while steaming calamari.  In a skillet over medium heat,
saute garlic in oil until lightly browned. Add onion and stir for 1
minute. Add tomato, bay leaf and soy sauce and cook for 3-5 minutes
until tomato pieces are soft.
Pour sauce on top of stuffed calamari.  Serve with rice.
Note: I save the tentacles from the calamari and as a side dish stir
fry them with some shrimp and vegetables. I used the broth from
steaming the calamari as a liquid in this dish. This is NOT a good
dish to serve to people who don't like calamari or are a bit
squeamish. Regular bananas can be used but they should be very firm
and green.
