Title: CERAMIC TILE & GROUT CLEANER
Categories: Information
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Vinegar
14 c  Warm water
1 c  Baking soda
1 c  Ammonia (sudsing or
-nonsudsing)
Pour baking soda into a clean gallon-size plastic jug. Add ammonia,
vinegar and warm water to fill. Swish the jug to mix ingredients
before it is completely full.

Cover jug tightly, label and keep out of the reach of children.
Smaller pump- type containers can be filled from the jug for small
jobs--make sure these containers are labeled and kept safely away
from children as well.

To use:  Spray solution directly onto tile and wipe with a damp
sponge or the kind of scrubbing pad made for Teflon pans.

Hint:  If grout or tiles are especially soiled, make a past of 2 tb
baking soda and 1 tb Ceramic Tile & Grout Cleaner (recipe above).
Brush it onto the stains with an old toothbrush. Let past remain for
5 minutes, then scrub off and rinse.

Note: This solution contains ammonia: do not mix with anything in the
bathroom containing bleach or dangerous fumes could result.

Yield:  1 gallon

This recipe safely removes the soap film that frequently forms on tile
surfaces and between the tiles. A more concentrated paste of the
cleaner can be made (see Hint) and left to clean stubborn stains on
the grout.
