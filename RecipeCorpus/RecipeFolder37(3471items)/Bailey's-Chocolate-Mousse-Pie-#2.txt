2 c  Frozen whipped topping
Choc-dipped strawberries*
6 oz Ready Crust (graham/choc)

*As garnish, if desired.  -- In saucepan, sprinkle unflavored gelatine
over milk.  Let stand about 1 minute.  Stir over low heat until
gelatine is dissolved, about 5 minutes.  Add chocolate and continue

vanilla.  Remove from heat and stir occasionally, adding Bailey's
