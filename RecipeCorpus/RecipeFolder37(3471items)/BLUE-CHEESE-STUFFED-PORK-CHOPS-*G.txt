Title: BLUE CHEESE STUFFED PORK CHOPS *G
Categories: Meats, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Yogurt, Plain;
4 ts Flour, All-purpose;
3/4 c  Milk;
1/2 ts Instant chicken bouillon;
ds Pepper;
1/2 c  Carrot; Shredded
1/4 c  Pecans; Chopped
1/4 c  Cheese, Blue; crumbled
1    Onions, Green; sliced
1 ts Worcestershire sauce;
4    Pork loin chops;
In a small bowl, combine carrot, pecans, blue cheese, green onion and
worcestershire sauce for stuffing. Trim fat from meat. Make a pocket
in each chop by cutting horizontally into the chop from the fat side
almost to the bone.  Spoon about 1/4 of the stuffing into each
pocket. Fasten with wooden toothpicks if needed. Grill until brown
and cooked through. In a small sauce pan, mix yogurt and flour.  Add
milk, chicken bouillon, and pepper.  Cook and stir until thickening
and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. To serve, remove the
toothpicks, and serve sauce over chops.

Original Posters Notes: From the Better Homes and Gardens "Grill It
Right" cookbook.  Got the book at Sam's about 4 months ago. Very good
book. I fixed this because my wife LOVES blue cheese, any form, on or
in anything <g>.  I am so-so on it, but this is a very good recipe,
and well worth the trouble to make the pockets and stuffing. Picky 13
year old (It's not a big mac) even ate it <g>.
