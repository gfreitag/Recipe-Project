Categories: Pasta/rice, Fruit, Foodmagazin
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 tb Grated Parmesan
Or to taste
1 tb Parsley leaves, minced
1/2 lb Penne
Or other tubular pasta
1    Pink grapefruit
2    Navel oranges
2 tb Butter
In a 3-quart saucepan bring 2-quarts salted water to a boil for pasta.

With a sharp knife cut peel and pith from grapefruit and oranges.
Working over a bowl cut grapefruit and orange sections free from
membranes, transferring sections to a plate, and halve them. Squeeze
excess juice from membranes into juice in bowl and reserve  1/4 cup
juice.

In a 12-inch skillet combine reserved juice, butter, and cream, and
heat sauce over moderate heat until butter is just melted. Keep cream
sauce warm over very low heat.

Add pasta to boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain pasta well
in a colander. Add pasta, fruit, Parmesan, and parsley to sauce and
toss with salt to taste until most of the sauce is absorbed.
