Title: RICOTTA CHEESE POUNDCAKE
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 ts Nutmeg
1 3/4 c  Milk or light cream
1 c  Ricotta cheese
1 c  Unsalted butter, softened
2 c  Packed light brown sugar
6    Large eggs
2 ts Vanilla extract
Finely grated zest of 2
Lemons
2 c  Unbleached flour
1.  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter and lightly flour a 10 inch tube
pan.
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter with an electric mixer,
gradually beating in the brown sugar.  Add the eggs, one at a
time,
beating well after each one.  Beat in the vanilla and lemon zest.
2.  Sift the flours, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg into another
bowl,
adding any pieces of bran that remain in the sifter; set aside.
Puree the milk or cream and ricotta cheese in a blender.
3.  Stir the dry ingredients into the creamed mixture alternately with
the milk/ricotta; do this in several stages, beginning and ending
with the dry ingredients.  Do not beat the batter.  Distribute
the batter evenly in the prepared pan, then bake for approximately
1 hour and 15 minutes; a tester inserted in the center should come
out clean.
4.  Cool the pan on a rack for 10 minutes, then invert it onto the
rack
and cool the cake for at least one hour before cutting.  Transfer
the cake to a serving platter.
