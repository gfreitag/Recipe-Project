Put dry beans in a lg. iron pot, cover w/ water, and hang over a
fire; boil 5 min, stirring constantly. Remove from fire, and add
pork, molasses, mustard, and salt. Cover w/ closely fitting cast-iron
cover. In dry ground, preferably gravel, dig a hole 2 ft. deep and 2
ft. across, and in it build a brisk hardwood fire. When the fire has
burned to coals, take part of the coals out w/ a shovel; place iron
pot in the hole and cover w/ the remaining coals.  On top of the
coals, place the gravel originally taken from the hole. Leave the pot
in the hole all day. Colonial Cookbook, updated as researched from
the Old Farmer's Almanac, 1792.
