Venison Jerky II
The Montana Cookbook
3   lbs lean venison
1   tbs salt
1   tea garlic powder
1/2 tea black pepper
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
1   tbs prepared mustard
Cut venison into 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick
strips.  Mix all other ingredients and pour over the
meat.  Marinate overnight.  Remove from marinade and
dry with paper towels.  Place in oven.  In a gas oven
the pilot flame will dry jerkey in 4 days.  In a 200
degree electric oven, leave in the oven until dry by
feel.

The second recipe seemed to come out better.  I used
an eye-round beef roast and the pilot light method.
If you want it hot, simply add some cayenne or
hotsauce to the marinade and watch out.
