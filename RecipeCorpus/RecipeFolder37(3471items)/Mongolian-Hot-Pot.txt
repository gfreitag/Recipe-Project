2 x  To 3 lb boneless lean lamb
4 oz Bean thread (transparent
Noodles, about 2 1/2 pkgs)
1/2 lb Spinach
1/2 lb Chinese cabbage
1 qt Chicken stock
1 ts Finely chopped ginger root

This type of "fondue" was introduced into China after the Mongolian
conquest in the 13th century and soon could be found throughout China
with regional touches added. USING A CLEAVER or sharp knife, slice
the lamb into very thin slices. Soak the noodles in warm water for 5
minutes, then drain them and cut them into 5-inch lengths. Separate
the spinach leaves from the stalks and wash them well. Discard the
stalks. Cut the Chinese cabbage into 3-inch pieces. Combine all the
ingredients for the dipping sauce in a small bowl and mix them well.
Each guest should have his or her own small portion of dipping sauce
and a plate containing lamb, spinach and Chinese cabbage. When you
are ready to begin, bring the stock to a boil and light the fondue.
Ladle the stock into the fondue pot and put the ginger, scallions,
garlic and coriander into the stock. Each person selects a piece of
food and cooks it quickly in the pot. When all the meat and
vegetables have been eaten, add the noodles to the pot, let them heat
through, then ladle the soup into soup bowls. This dish also works
successfully with other foods such as steak, fish balls, oysters,
shrimp, squid, mushrooms and lettuce, although it will no longer be a
Mongolian Hot Pot, but more like the Cantonese Chrysanthemum Pot.
