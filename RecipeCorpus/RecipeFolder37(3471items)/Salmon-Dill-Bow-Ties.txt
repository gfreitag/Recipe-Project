Categories: Pasta/rice, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Fresh ground pepper
3/4 c  Dry white wine
3/4 lb Bow tie pasta
1/2 lb Salmon fillet
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  Dill, minced
1. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 8-9 min. Drain well.

2. While the pasta is cooking, cut the salmon into 1-inch cubes. In a
small bowl, toss the salmon with 1 tbs olive oil, 1 tbs dill, and the
salt and pepper.

3. Heat the remaining 3 tbs olive oil in a large frying pan over
medium-high heat. Add the salmon and cook 2 min, gently turning once.

4. Add the wine, cover, reduce heat to medium and cook 3 min, or
until the salmon is just opaque throughout. Add the remaining dill
and cooked bow ties to the sauce and toss well.
