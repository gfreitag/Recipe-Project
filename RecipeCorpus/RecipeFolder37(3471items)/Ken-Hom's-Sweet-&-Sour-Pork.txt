3/4 lb Lean boneless pork
1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
1 tb Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Salt
1    Small green bell pepper

"Sweet-and-Sour" should be neither too sweet nor too sour, but
instead, like this one--a delicate balance of flavors. CUT THE PORK
INTO 1-INCH cubes. Put the cubes into a bowl together with the rice
wine or sherry, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon
salt, and marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the green and red
peppers into 1-inch squares. Peel and cut the carrot and scallions
into 1-inch chunks. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the
carrots in it for 4 minutes; drain and set aside. Mix the egg and
cornstarch in a bowl until they are well blended into a batter. Lift
the pork cubes out of the marinade, put them into the batter and coat
each piece well. Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or large wok until
it is almost smoking. Remove the pork pieces from the batter with a
slotted spoon, and deep-fry them. Drain the deep-fried pork cubes on
paper towels. Combine the chicken stock, soy sauce, salt, vinegar,
sugar and tomato paste in a large saucepan. Bring it to a boil. Add
vegetables (not the lychees or oranges.) Stir well. In a small bowl,
blend together the cornstarch and water. Stir this mixture into the
sauce and bring it back to a boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer.
Add the lychees or oranges and pork cubes. Mix well, and then turn
the mixture onto a deep platter. Serve at once.
