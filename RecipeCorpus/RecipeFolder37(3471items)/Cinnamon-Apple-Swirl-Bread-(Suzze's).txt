Categories: Breads, Breadmaker, Fruit, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings

1 c  Water or milk
2 1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Salt

You can go one of two ways here:  Either use the "Dough" setting, and
roll up the dough with the filling, then bake in a conventional
manner, or add some chopped apple at the beep.  The first way looks
better, the second way is easier.

Filling:

1 Apple, peeled, cored, and chopped into 1/4" dice
3 Tbs. Brown Sugar
1 tsp. Cinnamon
1 Tbs. Flour
1/4 tsp. nutmeg (optional)

Mix all the dry stuff together, then toss over the chopped apple.
Roll out the dough into a rectangle, then spread the mixture evenly
over the rectangle.  Roll the dough along the short edge, like a
jelly roll.

Place in a greased loaf pan, let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes,
then bake in a 350 F degree oven for about 40 minutes, until the loaf
is nice and brown, and sounds hollow when tapped.

Let cool on a rack, devour.
