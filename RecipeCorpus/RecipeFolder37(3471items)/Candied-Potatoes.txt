Title: Candied Potatoes
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Parsley; fresh, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
3 lb Maine potatoes
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
Peel and cut the potatoes into 1-inch dice.

Cook just until tender in boiling salted water, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Drain well.  You can refrigerate the potatoes at this point and
finish the dish later.

In a large, heavy frying pan, melt the sugar over medium heat.  When
the sugar starts to carmelize (brown), add the potatoes and butter.
Saute until the spuds are soft and golden brown.  Add the parsley and
season with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.
