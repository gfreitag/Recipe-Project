Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 servings
Salt and pepper
16    Loin lamb chops
(abt 5oz ea)
About 3/4" thick
3 tb Olive oil
1 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Instant couscous
1 tb Plus 1 tsp
Ground coriander seeds
1 tb Plus 1 tsp
Ground cinnamon
1 tb Plus 1  tsp
Ground cumin seeds
1 ts Ground cloves
1. In a small bowl, combine the coriander, cinnamon, cumin, cloves,
2 tsp salt and 1 tbs plus 1 tsp pepper. Coat the lamb on both sides
with the spice mixture.

2. Heat 1 1/2 tbs of the olive oil in each of 2 large skillets. Add
half the lamb chops to each skillet; if necessary, cook the lamb in
batches. Sear over high heat, turning once, until browned, about 4
min. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet; reserve the pan juices.

The chops can stand at room temperature for up to 1 hour.

3. Preheat the oven to 400 F. In a medium saucepan, bring 3 cups of
water to a boil with the butter and  1/2 tsp salt. Stir in the
couscous and remove from the heat. Cover and let stand until tender,
at least 5 min.

4. Bake the lamb chops for about 10 min, or until firm to the touch.
Fluff the couscous with a fork. Divide the couscous among 8 plates,
set the lamb chops on top and spoon any pan juices over.
