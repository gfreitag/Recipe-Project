Categories: Cake/cookie, Snacks, Desserts
Yield: 36 servings
2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Cocoa
Pinch of salt
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Butter or Margarine
4    Eggs
2 ts Vanilla
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
Beat together sugar and butter until creamy. Beat eggs with vanilla
and stir into butter mixture. Sift together dry ingredients and stir
into creamed mixture. Batter will be quite stiff.

Drop a heaping teaspoonful of batter into each section of a hot waffle
iron. Close lid and bake one to 1 1/2 minutes. Do not allow cookies
to cook until crisp. Cookies will burn if not removed promptly. Use
fork to remove cookies and place on racks to cool.

Immediately close lid of waffle iron to reheat, one to two minutes.
Meanwhile frost just baked cookie while warm, using recipe below or
your favourite frosting. Re-open waffle iron and repeat procedure.
Continue until all batter is used. Cookies will have ragged edges
characteristic of the waffle iron.
Blend together, 1 cup confectioner's sugar, one tablespoon butter, one
teaspoon vanilla, two tablespoons cocoa and enough cream or milk to
make a smooth, spreadable frosting.
