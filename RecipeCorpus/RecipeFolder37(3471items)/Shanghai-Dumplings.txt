Title: Shanghai Dumplings
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------------WRAPPER-------------------------------
1/4 c  Water; more or less
2 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 ts Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
1 lb Ground pork
1/2 ts Chinese 5 spice
1 ea Scallion; chopped
A very simple, yet filling, Shanghai staple.
Put flour in a food processer. Gradually add water (your mileage may
vary) while mixing until the dough forms into a ball. Roll out on a
floured surface to about 1/16" thick. Use a glass to cut into 3"
circles. Set wrappers aside.

Mix filling ingredients.

To assemble, put a wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place about 1
tablespoon of the filling in the wrapper and fold in half. Keep 1/4"
of the wrapper free of stuffing for a good seal. Moisten edge with
water. Crimp the edges together using your first 2 fingers and thumb,
fluting the edges. Go around in one direction, flip over, then
reverse. The idea is to seal them good!

Steam for 20 minutes. For a better treat, deep fry after steaming
until golden brown. Serve hot.

Variations/notes: Place each dumpling on a small piece of cabbage or
lettuce to prevent sticking to the steamer rack. Try boned pork
steaks, fat removed, ground in a food processor. Also try shrimp,
chicken, or a combo of all. Hot peppers, or pepper sauce, may be
added to the filling.

Sauces:

Chopped garlic and light soy sauce
Chinese (or Coleman's Dry) Mustard and light soy sauce
Sesame oil, sesame seeds, and dark soy sauce
Hot pepper sauce

Makes about 16 dumplings.

Additional note: When in Shanghai, I visited a restaurant that only
served dumplings (chow-dza) on Nanjing Lu. They had =so= many
variations of fillings and sauces; it was incredible.
