Tira Mi Su  -  An Italian Cheese Charlotte, the name means "Pick me
up". Widely popular dessert that people can't leave alone.  Has many
variations, including eggless, with cooked eggs, liquorless, and with
substitutes for the marscapone (tho common consensus claims there is
no comparable substitute).

* Toasted in a 375-degree oven for 15 minutes.

Arrange the ladyfingers on a plate and lightly soak them with the
cooled espresso.  Put half of the soaked ladyfingers in one layer in a
rectangular serving dish.  While the ladyfingers are soaking, beat
the egg yolks with the sugar until the yolks turn pale in color.  Add
the mascarpone, the liquors, and the extract, and stir gently.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a wire whisk until they
are stiff.  Gently fold the whites into the mascarpone mixture.
Use half of this mixture to make a layer on top of the ladyfingers in
the serving dish.  Sprinkle with half of the chopped chocolate.
Repeat the

procedure with another layer of soaked ladyfingers, the mascarpone
mixture, and chocolate.  Cover with tin foil and refrigerate for at
least 1 hour before serving.
