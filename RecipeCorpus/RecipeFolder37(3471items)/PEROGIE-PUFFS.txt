Press cottage cheese through potato ricer or sieve. Add to flour,
baking soda and salt. Rub well together. Mix oil, water and beaten
eggs and add to flour mixture. Knead and add more flour if needed to
make a rather sticky dough (not dry). Pinch off a piece of dough,
flatten in the palm of your hand and fill with a mixture of mashed

Deep fry until brown. These also freeze well. This dish is typical of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
