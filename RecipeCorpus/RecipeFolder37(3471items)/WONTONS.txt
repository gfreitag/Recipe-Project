To make the filling: In a large bowl, combine all the chopped
ingredients and seasonings. Mix thoroughly, set aside. To assemble
the wonton: Place 1 teaspoon of filling just below the center of each
wrapper, fold bottom over the filling. Roll up the filled cylinder
leaving 1/2 inch of wrap unrolled at the top. Fold both sides down
under the cylinder. Pinch ends firmly together with the beaten egg.
As each wonton is finished, place it on a plate and cover with a
moistened towel. To cook: In a wok or large pot, bring 3 quarts of
water to a boil and drop in wontons. Return to boil and reduce heat.
Simmer 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water to stop
cooking. Drain well. Serve with dipping sauce or soup. For Fried
Wontons: Do not boil. Deep fry 3-5 minutes. May be frozen. Defrost
and reheat in 375 degree oven for 15 minutes.
