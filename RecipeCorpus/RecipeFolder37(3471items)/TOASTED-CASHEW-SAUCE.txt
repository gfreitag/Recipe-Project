sold. Buy the ones called "raw" in the store.

Spread the cashews about 1/4" thick on a shallow baking dish or pie
pan. bake for 10-15 minutes at 300F, stirring once. Blend the
cashews, 1/4 cup at a time in the blender until finely ground. Add
all the ingredients to the blender and liquefy. Heat the sauce on
medium-low heat, stirring regularly. When thickened and hot
throughout, serve over vegetables, grains or other main dishes. Keeps
