Makes large loaf in Hitachi.  This is the best sourdough for bread
machine that I have ever tried.  Use quick bread setting.

Adapted from recipe of Helen Fleischer.

SOURDOUGH STARTER

1 cup flour 1 cup water 1 tbsp sugar

Place in container in draft free spot in kitchen.  Stir a couple of
times a day.  After about two to three days, you can start to use the
starter. Make sure that each time you use some of the starter,
replace with more flour, water, and sugar to continue it.  Takes
about a month to get real 'sour'. Though I have had mine going only
about three days now and it still produces lots of flavour

I started this mixture on a Monday morning.  Tuesday night I gave the
bread a whirl in the machine.  The loaf turned out the best one yet.
After using a cup of the starter, I then added more flour, sugar, and
water, and Wednesday morning put on another loaf.  Turned out with
the same excellent results.  Out of all the different recipes that I
have tried, this one is going to be the one that I make most often.
It comes out whiter in color than the white bread recipe, has more
flavour and a really nice texture. It rises to the very top of the
machine, and the color of the crust is even. Nicest feature?  You get
all these results from using the bread rapid cycle... 8-}  So you
could get three to four loaves made in a day if you had to... 8-}
