Title: Squash And Orange Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
See below
Peel and finely dice the squash of your choice, leaving out any seeds
etc.

Finely chop a medium sized onion or a handful of shallots. Put both
in a large pan and add just enough water to cover. Add a little very
finely chopped parsley.

Bring pan to the boil, and then simmer for 15-20 minutes (or until
squash and onion have gone very soft). Turn out heat and allow to cool
slightly.

Put contents of pan through a blender till an even consistency has
been achieved.

Tip back into pan and add 5 fl oz fresh orange juice and fresh ground
black pepper. Reheat, but do not boil.

Serve marbled with plain yoghourt.
