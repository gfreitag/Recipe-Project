Title: ROAST TURKEY WITH STUFFINGS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 12 servings
-(see recipes)
Butter or margarine; melted
1    Whole turkey
- fresh or thawed
Stuffing of choice
Remove turkey neck and giblets from cavities of bird, rinse turkey
and wipe dry. (Cook neck and giblets for broth or to make giblet
gravy.) Prepare stuffing of choice. Stuff loosely into neck cavity,
then skewer neck skin to back. Stuff body cavity loosely. Sew
openings shut by lacing piece of string on wood picks. Fasten down
legs either by tying or tucking under skin band. Twist wings akimbo
under turkey. Place turkey, breast up, on rack in shallow roasting
pan. Brush with melted butter. If roast meat thermometer is used,
insert into thick part of thigh. Bulb should not touch bone. Roast at
325F. A tent of foil placed loosely over turkey keeps it from
browning too fast and may be removed when necessary to baste turkey.
Remove foil last half hour for final browning. Turkey is done when
thermometer registers 180 to 185F, or when thick part of drumstick
feels tender when pressed with thumb and forefinger or when drumstick
and thigh move easily.
