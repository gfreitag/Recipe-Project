TARATO (Yogurt Soup)

Tarato comes from Bulgaria.  The Jews of Bulgaria, like those of
Holland, Greece, Turkey, and Italy, are descended from Jews expelled
from Spain and Portugal in the 15 th century.  This cold soup is
particularly suitable for hot summer nights in Israel.  Yogurt, the
main ingredient, has been a popular food in Israel for many years.

Mix all ingredients except nuts.  Sprinkle with nuts and cool in
refrigerator for 2-3 hours before serving.
