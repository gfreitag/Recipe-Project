Title: Baked Miniature Pumpkins
Categories: Holiday, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
See below
Here's a side-dish mini-pumpkin recipe I got out of the Washington
Post a couple of years ago. Probably to make custard-filled ones,
you'd mix up any standard custard recipe, put a few tbsp in each,
sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg and bake as below.

Slice off top 1/2" of each pumpkin, scoop out seeds. Rub cavity with
salt and pepper. Into each pour 1-2 tbsp cream, milk or mascarpone
cheese. Add 1 fresh or dried sage leaf to each, then top with grated
gruyere or fontina cheese. Replace lid and bake in a shallow pan at
350F 35-45 min until just tender. Don't overcook or they will
collapse or split.
