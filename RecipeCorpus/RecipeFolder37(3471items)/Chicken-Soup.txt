CHICKEN SOUP

This is the well-known and now universal soup of the "Yiddishe mama"
as it was served in east European Jewish homes.  Former Prime
Minister of Israel Golda Meir was known to cook a fine-tasting
chicken soup for both family and
VIPs whenever they came to call.  Chicken soup is reputed to cure the
sick but is equally recommended to the healthy.

Clean chicken thoroughly.  Combine in a deep saucepan with water,
onions, and bouillon.  Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat for
1 hour.  Add remaining ingredients.  Cover and cook over low heat 1/2
hour longer, or until chicken is tender.  Remove chicken and strain
soup.  Taste and correct
seasonings. Makes about 2 to 2-1/2 quarts of soup.  Use the chicken in
other
dishes or serve with the soup.
