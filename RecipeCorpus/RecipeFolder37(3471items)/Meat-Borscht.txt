Meat borscht comes from Russia and is a winter favorite.  It is
cooked for several hours on a low flame and its pungent aroma
penetrates every corner of the home.  It has become popular to serve
hot borscht at parties at the stroke of midnight.  No one wanting to
miss this treat will go home before that hour. The influx of
thousands of newcomers from the former Soviet Union
in recent years has reinforced the popularity of the various types of
borscht in Israel.
