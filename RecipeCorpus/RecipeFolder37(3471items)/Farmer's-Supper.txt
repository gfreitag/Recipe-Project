Title: Farmer's Supper
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Stove top
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Bell peppers, chopped
2 c  Ham; julienned
6    Eggs
1/2 c  Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 1/2 tb Oil
5 md Potatoes; peeled,thin sliced
Salt
Pepper, black
1/2 c  Onions, chopped
Melt fat in large skillet.  Spread half of the potato slices in
skillet and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Top with half
the onion and green pepper, sprinkle with seasonings again.  Arrange
half of meat on top; repeat layers.  Cover and look over low heat 20
minutes, or until potatoes are tender.

Break eggs on top; cover and cook until eggs are desired doneness,
about 5 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Top with cheese and cover a minute or two until
cheese starts to melt.

Sylvia's comments: I loved the final result, but not the directions!
That 30-minutes of cooking, in MY favorite cast-iron pan and on MY
stove, took over 2 hours!  When I made it again, I ignored the
careful layering and tossed in the potatoes and onions (skipped the
bell pepper, my family doesn't like it) over medium heat and
scrambled them occasionally to keep them from burning, added ham
later, & created little nests to break the eggs into.  It still took
about 30 minutes for the potatoes and another 30 minutes for the eggs
(on Low), but was a low-attention dish.  I forgot to add the cheese
and it was still delicious.
