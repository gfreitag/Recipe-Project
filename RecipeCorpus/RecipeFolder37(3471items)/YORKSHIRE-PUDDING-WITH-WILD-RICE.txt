Title: YORKSHIRE PUDDING WITH WILD RICE
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 10 servings
3/4    Stick butter or
-margarine
4 lg Eggs
2 c  Milk
1    Beef bouillon cube
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
2/3 c  Uncooked wild rice
2 c  Water
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
6 tb Butter or margarine
-OR-
1 ts Salt
1. Place the rice, water, and half of the salt in a small saucepan and
bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and
simmer until the rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Drain off any
remaining water. Cool to room temperature. [The wild rice may be
prepared ahead of time and refrigerated overnight if desired.] 2.
While the rice is cooking, beat the eggs until frothy in a large
mixing bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in the milk, flour, and the
remaining half of the salt. The batter will be slightly lumpy. [The
batter may be refrigerated overnight, if desired.] 3. Preheat the
oven to 450 F. Stir the rice into the batter. Place the butter or
margarine in a 9 x 13-inch glass casserole (for each basic recipe for
ten) and place the casserole in the oven until the butter is melted.
Remove from the oven and stir in the bouillon cube and the
Worcestershire sauce until dissolved. Return the casserole to the
oven and leave until sizzling. Pour the wild-rice batter into the
casserole and bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes or
until puffed and golden. 4. Cut into squares and serve immediately.
