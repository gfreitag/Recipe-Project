Title: Jook, Chinese Thick Rice Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Dark Soy Sauce
1 ts Salt
2 ea Green Onion Stalks
12 ea Water Chestnuts
1/2 c  Long Grain Rice
1/2 c  Glutinous Rice
5 qt Chicken Broth
1 lb Ground Pork
Rinse rice 2 or 3 times. Soak overnight. Mince green onions and water
chestnuts. Mix with ground pork, soy sauce and salt.
Bring stock and rice to a boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 2-3
hours or until the rice breaks down completely and the soup becomes
thick and creamy. Turn heat up and add ground pork mixture, shaping 1
tsp at a time into a small ball and dropping it into the soup. Cook
for 5 minutes or until pork balls are done. Correct seasoning. Serve
in individual soup bowls. Pass the condiments around for each person
to choose his or her favourite toppings. I like Nam-Yuey in mine!
You can make this ahead of time and reheat.
You can also use chicken slices, ground beef, beef slices, fish
filets or ham slices. A roast chicken or turkey carcass is excellent
for making the stock. Just cook the carcass, rice and water together.
Take out the carcass when the soup is done. I add Duck Liver Sausage
bits! Condiments which you can use:
Sesame oil, White Pepper, Green Onions, Chinese Parsley (cilantro),
tea melon (sweet cucumber), Szechwan turnips, chopped peanuts, Deep
Fried Devils (Yao Ja Guai, which are small fried bread sticks),
