Title: DOGGIE TREATS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 10 servings
2 ts Brown sugar
1 ts Granulated Bouillon (fish)
6 tb Meat drippings
1    Egg, beaten
1/2 c  Ice water
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Powdered milk
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Onion powder
My dogs prefer fish flavored granulated bouillon, but you can use any
flavor you wish.  Combine it and the rest of the dry ingredients. Cut
in drippings until mixture resembles cornmeal.  Mix in egg. Add just
enough water to make mixture form a ball. Pat (or roll) dough to 1/2"
thick and cut into desired shapes. Small dogs (like mine) like bite
sized pieces like stars about the size of a quarter.  The general
rule is, the bigger the dog, the bigger the "cookie". The "10
servings" are for 6 inch bones.  Place on a lightly greased cookie
sheet. Bake at 25 to 30 minutes, until hard and dry.  Cool before
serving.
