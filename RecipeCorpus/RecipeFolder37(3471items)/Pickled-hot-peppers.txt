Title: Pickled hot peppers
Categories: Pickles, Can/preserv, Hot/spicy
Yield: 8 pints
4 ts Salt
Olive oil (optional)
4 qt Peppers
4 c  Vinegar
4 c  Water
Wash peppers thoroughly.  Remove core, seeds, and stems of large
peppers. Cut as desired, or leave whole after coring.  The small, hot
peppers may be left whole with stems intact.  Make 2 small slits in
whole peppers.

Mix vinegar and water; heat to 150-160F/66-71C about to the simmering
point.  Since it is rather volatile, vinegar should NOT boil a long
time. Pack peppers rather tightly into jars.  Pour hot vinegar and
water over the peppers to 1/2 inch of jar rim. Add salt to taste,
seal, and process 15 minutes in simmering (180-185F/82-85C) Hot-Water
Bath.

If oil is desired, add vinegar to only 3/4 in of jar top.  Add olive
oil to come 1/2 in from top.  The peppers will be coated with oil
when they pass through the oil layer as you use them.

recipe comes from U of Calif. publ. no. 4080.  (as published in
"Putting Food By" book by Greene/Hertzberg/Vaughan 4th ed.)
