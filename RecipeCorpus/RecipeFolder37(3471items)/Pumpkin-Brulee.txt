Marian says:

This absolutely divine dessert is best made well ahead of time.
Everyone warns about how hard it is to get a good
almost-but-not-burnt-brown-sugar topping, but this method has always
worked for me.  You must finely puree the pumpkin and use a
refrigerator-to-oven dish.  You will end up with a crisp sugar
caramel on top of a velvety cream custard.

Scald cream and vanilla or rum.  Beat egg yolks and superfine sugar
until lightly colored and thick; beat in pumpkin, cinnamon, and salt.
Slowly whisk in the hot cream.  Pour into a 6-cup or an 8x8-inch
refrigerator-to-oven dish.  Place into a baking pan, and pour boiling
water halfway up the sides of the dish.  Bake in a preheated 350F
oven for 45-60 min, until the custard is set (time depends upon the
height of the baking dish).  Chill for 8 hours or overnight.

Preheat broiler, and place an oven rack 8-10 inches below it.  Sieve
the brown sugar and sprinkle it evenly over the custard.  Place dish
in a large pan, and surround it with ice cubes.  Place on the broiler
rack, and, watching carefully, let the brown sugar heat until it just
begins to bubble, brown and melt.  Remove from the broiler; cool for
10 min.  Return to the broiler and repeat the process.  The sugar
should become very brown, but not burnt.  Remove pumpkin brulee from
oven, and chill for 2 hours.

Serves 6.

Can also cook the custard in a double boiler over simmering water.
Stir until the mixture coats a spoon (163F).  Pour into a dish and
refrigerate.  Proceed as above.
