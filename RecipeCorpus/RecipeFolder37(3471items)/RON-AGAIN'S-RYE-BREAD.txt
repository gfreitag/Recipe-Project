Title: RON-AGAIN'S RYE BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 16 servings
2 ts Caraway seed
1/2 tb Salt
2 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Water, warm
1/2 tb Yeast
1 c  Rye flour
2 3/4 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Sugar, brown
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery,
in order.  Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white
bread" and push Start.

This is the best rye bread recipe I've ever made in the DAK
R2D2. It was given to me by Ron Lanning, and I think he may also
have posted it on the board. His recipe was for the small
machine, and this my adaptation for the larger ones.

It makes a very light, fluffy rye with a nice, domed top.

I find that my rye bread does better if I leave the dough a
little on the wet side. It will rise like crazy, so just before
the bake cycle starts, I press it down just a bit to keep it
from collapsing during the bake cycle.
