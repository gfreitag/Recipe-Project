Title: SUNFLOWER HONEY WHEAT BREAD (BREAD MAKING IN A BAG)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 servings
2    Pkgs active dry yeast
1/3 c  Margarine
1/3 c  Nonfat dry milk
1 tb Salt
5 c  All-purpose flour
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Sunflower seeds or raisins
1/3 c  Honey
2 1/4 c  Warm water (105 to 115 deg)
Combine in a 2 gallon heavy duty freezer bag: 1 cup water, 2 pkgs
yeast, 1/3 cup honey and 1 cup all-purpose flour.

Squeeze upper part of bag to force air out. Close top of bag tightly.
Rest bag on table. Mix by working bag with fingers about 20 seconds
or until all ingredients are completely blended.

Add all remaining ingredients but for the flour and sunflower seeds or
raisins.

Mix by working bag with fingers. Gradually add 2 cups whole wheat
flour and 1 cup sunflower seeds or raisins, whichever you prefer.
Gradually add remaining all-purpose flour until a stiff dough is
formed, or until dough pulls away from the bag. (Reserve about 1/2
cup flour to use during the kneading process.) Turn dough out on
lightly floured board, divided in thirds. (may also divide in 1/2 and
bake in 2 bans, 9x5x3 inches.)

Knead each part well, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more
flour `ONLY' to keep dough from sticking. Cover with plastic mixing
bag. Let rise 30 minutes or until double in bulk. Work dough and form
each into a loaf and place in a 8-1/2x4-1/2x2-1/4 inch loaf pan
(makes 3 loaves in this size pan.

Cover loosely with plastic bag and let rise in warm place 45 to 60
minutes or until doubled. Uncover. Bake on lower rack in 400 degree
oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. (May want to cover
loosly with foil the last 10 or 15 minutes to prevent crust from
becoming too brown.) Brush tops with melted butter; remove from pans
and cool on racks.
