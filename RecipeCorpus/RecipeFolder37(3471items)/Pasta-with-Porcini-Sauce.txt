Title: Pasta with Porcini Sauce
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 12 servings
Salt
2 lb Maccheroncini *
1 c  Heavy cream
4 tb Butter, softened
Fresh ground pepper
1 1/2 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese (4 1/2 oz)
2 1/2 lb Porcini mushrooms or
1 1/2 lb White mushrooms and
1 lb Shiitake mushrooms
1/2 c  Onion(s), chopped
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
3 tb Garlic, finely chopped
2 tb Parsley, chopped
* from the picture this looks like some kind of tubular pasta like
penne

1. Quickly rinse the mushrooms under running water (or wipe them
clean with a soft cloth or mushroom brush). Cut the porcini or white
mushrooms from cap to stem into thin lengthwise slices; stem the
shiitakes and thinly slice the caps.

2. In a large skillet, cook the onion in the olive oil over
moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent. Add
the garlic and stir just until fragrant; do not let it become any
darker than pale gold.

3. Add the parsley, stir quickly once or twice, then add all the
mushrooms. Add a generous amount of salt and stir. Cover the skillet
and lower the heat to moderate. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until
the liquid released by the mushrooms has evaporated, about 20 min.

Can be prepared to this point several hours ahead. Reheat briefly
before proceeding.

4. Bring plenty of water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt and drop
in the pasta, stirring it periodically.

5. While the pasta is cooking, add the cream, butter and plenty of
fresh ground pepper to the pan with the mushrooms. Raise the heat to
high and simmer, stirring frequently, until the cream has reduced by
half.

6. When the pasta is al dente, drain it and toss it immediately into
a warm serving bowl with the mushroom sauce. Add the grated cheese,
toss to thoroughly coat the pasta and serve at once.
