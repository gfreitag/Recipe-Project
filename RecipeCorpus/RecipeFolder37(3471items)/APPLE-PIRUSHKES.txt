Title: APPLE PIRUSHKES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 14 servings
4 c  Flour, sifted, all-purpose
7    Apples, medium, tart
1/4 c  Raisins, seedless
1/4 c  Nut meats, chopped
1/2 c  Jelly, any desired
1/2 c  Sugar
Cinnamon
1 c  Water, boiling
1 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Shortening, vegetable or fat
1    Yeast, cake
1 tb Water, lukewarm
1    Egg, well beaten
Pour the boiling water over the salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar and
shortening. When it is lukewarm, add the yeast which has been
dissolved in the 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water. Add the egg and 1
1/2 cups of the flour. Let this batter rise at 85F until double in
bulk, then add the remaining flour. Knead until smooth. Let rise
again for 1 hour. Divide the dough into 14 parts.  Roll out each part
until 1/2" thick. Peel, core, and cut apples in half.  Place a half,
cut side up, on each piece of dough. Combine the remaining
ingredients and fill the cores with the mixture. Press the dough
firmly together over the apples and invert on a dull, greased, cookie
tin. Brush with melted shortening, and sprinkle with a little sugar
and ground cinnamon.  Let rise for 1 hour. Bake at 350F for 40
minutes, until a rich brown.  Serve hot.  Allow 1 or 2 for each
portion.
