In the AD 4th-Century Roman cookbook of Apicius, there are two
recipes for sauce to serve with ostrich. One is a honey-mustard
vinaigrette with pepper, herbs (lovage, thyme) and liquamen, which
was a fish sauce like the Vietnamese nuoc mam. This is the other one,
which comes out like a wacky sort of barbecue sauce.

Mix pepper, mint, cumin, celery seeds, dates, honey, vinegar,
Sherry, fish sauce and oil in saucepan. Bring to boil. Remove 1
tablespoon sauce to cup, cool slightly, then add cornstarch and stir
to dissolve. Stir into sauce and bring to boil until thickened. Serve
with cooked ostrich.

Makes about 2 cups sauce.
