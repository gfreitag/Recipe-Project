Title: Tomato Risotto
Categories: Pasta/rice, Tomatoes
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Assorted cherry and
Pear tomatoes, halved
Or quartered if large
Salt and pepper
1/3 c  Basil, finely shredded
2 tb Grated Pecorina-
Romano cheese
1 lg Sweet onion(s)
Coarsely chopped
1 tb Olive oil
3 c  Tomato juice
2 1/2 c  Chicken stock
2 md Shallots, minced
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
1 c  Dry white wine
1. Preheat the oven to 375 F. On a baking sheet, toss the onion with
1 tsp of the olive oil; spread out on the sheet. Roast for about 20
min, stirring, until lightly browned.

2. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, bring the tomato juice and
chicken stock to a boil over moderately high heat; keep warm. Heat
the remaining 2 tsp olive oil in a large nonreactive saucepan. Add
the shallots and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until
translucent, about 2 min. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 min.
Add the wine and cook, stirring, until almost completely absorbed,
about 7 min.

3. Add 1 cup of the hot tomato broth to the rice and simmer over
moderate heat, stirring constantly, until almost all of the broth is
absorbed. Add 1 more cup of broth and stir constantly until absorbed.

Make Ahead Tip: Stir the first 2 cups of liquid into the rice as
usual. Spread the risotto out on a baking sheet and let cool, then
refrigerate for up to 1 day; refrigerate the remaining broth
separately. Before proceeding, reheat the liquid. Return the risotto
to the saucepan, set the pan over the heat and continue with the
recipe.

Continue adding broth to the risotto, 1 cup at a time, stirring
constantly until absorbed before adding more. The rice is done when
it's al dente and lightly bound with creamy cooking liquid, about 25
min total cooking time. Stir in the tomatoes and roasted onion until
heated through. Season the risotto with salt and pepper, garnish with
the basil and cheese and serve at once.
