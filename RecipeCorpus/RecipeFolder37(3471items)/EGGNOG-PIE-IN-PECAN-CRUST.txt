PECAN CRUST: Butter 10 in. pie plate. In medium bowl, combine pecans,
sugar and melted butter. Mix well. Press firmly into pie plate. Cover
and refrigerate 30 minutes while preheating oven to 375 F. Bake crust
until lightly browned (about 15 - 20 min.) EGGNOG FILLING: In a small
bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water and brandy and allow to soften.
While that soaks, combine egg yolks and sugar in small mixer bowl and
mix at high speed with electric mixer until mixture forms ribbons
when beaters are lifted. Pour into large heavy saucepan and slowly
stir in hot milk. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly,
until mixture thickens enough to coat the spoon (and/or thermometer
registers 172 F). DO NOT BOIL. Remove from heat and stir in softened
gelatin until disolved. Stir in vanilla and rum. Pour custard into a
medium bowl set into a larger bowl of ice and water and allow to
cool, stirring frequently. When it begins to set around the edges,
remove from ice bath (do not allow to set completely). In chilled
bowl, beat cream to soft peaks and fold gradually into custard. If
necessary, refrigerate filling a few minutes until it mounds when
spooned. Pile filling into crust and refigerate until set (about an
hour). CREAM TOPPING: In chilled medium bowl, whip cream and
confectioners sugar to stiff peaks and pile on top of pie. Garnish
with chocolate curls and raspberries.
