Title: Venison Jerky 2 From the Montana Cookbook
Categories: Game, Meats, Jerky/rubs
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Prepared mustard
3 lb Lean venison
1 tb Salt
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Black pepper
Cut venison into 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick strips.  Mix all
other ingredients and pour over the meat.  Marinate overnight. Remove
from marinade and dry with paper towels. Place in oven. In a gas oven
the pilot flame will dry jerkey in 4 days. In a 200 degree electric
oven, leave in the oven until dry by feel.

(Note By Rich Harper)  This should work if you get the leanest beef
possible (Flank Steak for example).
