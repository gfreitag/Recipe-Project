demerara: a brown sugar, but each grain is kind of separate. If you
have a Carribean store in your neighbourhood, their brown sugar is
what you want. But you can substitute light brown sugar for it.
Muscvada: Very dark brown sugar (almost black), sticks
together in one solid lump and has to be prised apart. The
rawest (and tastiest) of all the sugars. Really good for dark
cakes and especially Christmas puddings.
Brown crystal. Very large variagated brown crystals of sugar,
hard and crunchy usually used in coffee.
jaggary; barely refined cane sugar.  Substitute a "raw" sugar or
Mexican piloncillo sugar.
Scampi OR Dublin Bay Prawns; Butterfly shrimps or Pacific prawns
