Title: Fresh Herb Buttermilk Biscuits
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Butter -- cold
1    Egg -- slightly beaten
3/4 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Fresh herbs -- * see note
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 tb Double-acting baking powder
3/4 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
Sift dry ingredients together. Cut butter into tablespoons and,
with a pastry blender, blend into dry ingredients until texture is
that of cornmeal. Stir parsley, chives, and oregano/thyme with 1/2 cup
buttermilk into beaten egg and add mixture to flour mixture. Stir
quickly, adding remainder of buttermilk as necessary until dough forms
a ball. Turn onto floured surface and knead once. Let dough rest for a
minute, then roll out to 3/4" thickness. Cut into 2" rounds. Place
biscuits on buttered baking sheet, 1" apart. Bake at 400 degrees for
15 minutes or until golden brown.
