are combined. Chop the almonds and walnuts into small pieces.  Add
the soft butter, eggs, milk, vanilla and chopped nuts to the dry
ingredients. Stir the mixture well. Then beat the batter until it is
well blended. Grease the cake pan with the butter.  Sprinkle with the
tablespoon of flour and shake the pan until bottom is evenly coated.
Shake out an extra flour. Bake the cake for 45 minutes. Test with a
toothpick for doneness. Remove the from the oven let it cool
slightly. Cut it into squares and serve warm.

Topping:  You might want to sprinkle powdered sugar or spread whipped
cream on top.

STORY:  Thanks to Dr. Sylvester Graham, you can bake this crunchy
cake from crackers named after him.  Graham, who lived in the early
1800's insisted that whole wheat flour was far more healthy then
white flour. In those days, it was.  Whole wheat flour was made by
grinding the whole grain of wheat.  For white flour, only the soft
inside of the grain was used. The outer layers, rich with vitamins
and minerals, were left out. Today, white flour is "enriched" with
the need vitamins and minerals. But whole wheat is still naturally
healthy.  So are the graham crackers, made from this flour. Use them
for this one-bowl cake. It's all American.
