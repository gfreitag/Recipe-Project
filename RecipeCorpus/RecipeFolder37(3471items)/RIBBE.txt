Title: RIBBE
Categories: Main dish, Meats, West europe, Holiday
Yield: 10 servings
Pepper
2 1/2 dl Water
3 kg Pork ribs
Salt
The steak should be without the pork chop part. If you prefer to use a
loin, extend the time in the oven to 2 1/2 - 3 hours.
Break the ribs every 5 centimeters. Make a checkerboard pattern on the
skin side with a sharp knife. 1-2 days before the steak goes in the
oven rub it with salt and pepper and lay it with the skin-side down.
Heat the oven to 230 C. Put the steak in with the skin-side down. Put
some water in the tray with it. Cover the steak. Let it be for 20
minutes. Take away the cowering, turn the steak, reduce temperature
to 175 C. Place it high in the oven. Ready after 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Be
sure that the skin does not get black, it should just be slightly
crispy. Cut into pieces; between the ribs and where you broke the
bones. When served warm it should be accompanied by surkaal, sweet
mustard and hot fat.
Is also served cold. Either in pieces or sliced to go on a loaf of
bread. Norwegians still prefer it with sweet mustard.
