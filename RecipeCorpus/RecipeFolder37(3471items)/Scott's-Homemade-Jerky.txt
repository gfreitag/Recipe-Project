Title: Scott's Homemade Jerky
Categories: Meats, Game, Jerky/rubs
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Onion powder
1 ds Cayenne
1 ds Mild Indian curry
1 pk Dynasty Brand Szechwan Hot
& Spicy
Chinese Seasoning Mix
1/2 c  Water
Marinate overnight then dry.  If you want it hotter sprinkle garlic or
cayenne on meat prior to drying. This is good for about 2 lbs of meat.

I have used this on steak, venison and turkey ham and works well with
all. My kids don't like it hot so I make one tray for them then the
rest is mine to make as hot as I like.
