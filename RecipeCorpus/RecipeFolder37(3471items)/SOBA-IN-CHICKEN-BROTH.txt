Categories: Soup/stew, Japanese, Poultry
Yield: 10 cups
-soy sauce
1 tb Rice-wine vinegar
2 tb Miso paste
1 c  Packed spinach leaves,
-washed, dried & coarsely
-chopped
4    Scallions, finely chopped
1/4 c  Grated daikon radish
8 oz Dried soba noodles
8 c  Homemade chicken broth
1 tb Finely grated fresh ginger
1/4 lb Fresh shiitake mushrooms,
-stems removed, slivered
-(about 1 cup)
2 tb Sake or mirin
2 tb Tamari or reduced-sodium
In large pot, bring at least 3 qts water to a boil.  Slowly add
soba.  When water returns to a boil, add 1/2 c cold water. Repeat
steps of returning water to a boil and adding cold water 2 or 3
times, until the noodles are just tender (it will take 5 to 7
minutes total.)  Drain and rinse well, working your fingers
through the strands to separate them.  Set aside.  Combine
chicken broth and ginger in the large pot and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, add mushrooms and simmer for 8
minutes.  Add sake or mirin, tamari or soy sauce and rice-wine
vinegar.  In a small bowl, whisk a ladleful of the broth with
miso to dissolve it; return the mixture to the pot, along with
spinach.  Simmer for 2 minutes more and remove from the heat.
Divide the noodles among soup bowls and ladle the soup over the
top.  Garnish with scallions and daikon.
