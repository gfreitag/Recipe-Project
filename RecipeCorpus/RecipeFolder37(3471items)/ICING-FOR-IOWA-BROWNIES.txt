1/3 c  Evaporated milk*
1/2 c  Chocolate morsels*
1    Stick Butter/Margarine
1 1/2 c  Sugar

as good as above.
In saucepan combine butter, sugar and evaporated milk. Bring to
boil. Boil one minute. Stir in chocolate morsels and heat and stir
until melted. Frosting will be thin and glossy, but sets up on the
brownies.
