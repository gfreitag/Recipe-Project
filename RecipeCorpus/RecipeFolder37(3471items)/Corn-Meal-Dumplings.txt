1 tb Onion; minced [optional]
1 tb Butter; melted or bacon fat
6 c  Stock; simmering hot

The secret to making light dumplings is to keep them steaming on top
of simmering liquid. Too low a temp and they won't cook through
thoroughly but too a high a boil and the egg protein will toughen.

Use enough liquid in a big enough pot for the dumplings to expand; do
not crowd them.

Make sure the pot's lid fits securely so that steam won't escape and
NEVER lift the lid until the dumplings are finished.

Sift the corn meal, flour, baking powder and salt together. Add the
optional seasonings to the flour mixture. Beat the eggs, add milk and
combine the egg-milk mixture with the dry ingredients. Stir in the
melted butter or bacon fat.

To make the dumplings extra fluffy and light, separate the eggs. Beat
the yolks thoroughly and add the milk. Set aside. Beat the whites
until stiff. Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients; add the
butter or bacon fat. Then gently fold in the whites with a minimum of
stirring.

Drop the batter from a spoon into hot stock or water. The stock
should be at a low rolling boil; as the batter is added the temp will
drop. Cover the pot tightly. Simmer the dumplings 15 min. Remove them
with a slotted spoon and serve at once.
