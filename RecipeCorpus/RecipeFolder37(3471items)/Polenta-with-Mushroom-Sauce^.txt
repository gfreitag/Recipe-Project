Mushroom Sauce:
Soak dried mushrooms in hot water for 15-20 minutes. Drain; strain
liquid through a coffee filter, set aside and reserve.

Rinse and chop mushrooms.

Cook garlic on oil until soft. Discard garlic. Add onions, oregano
and 1 tablespoon parsley, cook until onion is soft. Add all mushrooms
and nutmeg, cook until mushrooms begin to soften. Stir in reserved
liquid, tomatoes and about half their juice. Heat to a boil, breaking
up tomatoes with a spoon. Reduce heat and simmer, uncoered, 8-10
minutes until the juices are reduced slightly. Season.

Polenta:
Add salt to boiling water. Reduce heat so water is boiling gently. Add
cornmeal in a slow thin stream, stirring constantly so it doesn't get
lumpy.
Cook 15-20 minutes, until thickened and smooth. Pour polenta into 8"
square baking pan or large oiled plate. Let stand 5-10 minutes until
firm.

To serve:
Cut polenta into 8 rectangles or wedges and put 2 on each plate.
Reheat sauce
of necessary and add the remaining parsley. Taste for seasonings and
pour over

polenta. Top with Parmesan.
