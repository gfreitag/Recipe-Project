Categories: Vegetables, Salads, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
1 sm Romaine lettuce
1 bn Arugula
1 sm Radicchio head
MMMMM------------------------VINAIGRETTE-----------------------------
1 ts Garlic, finely chopped
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 ts Dijon mustard
MMMMM----------------------PARMESAN BRITTLE---------------------------
1/4 ts Paprika
1 ts Black pepper, fresh ground
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  All purpose flour
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
Use lettuces that have flavour to stand up to the rich, sharp taste
of the brittle and the bite of the dressing. Arugula is a spicy leafy
green similar
in flavour to watercress. If you can't find arugula, use watercress
in its place.
1. Tear lettuce into bite sized pieces and combine in bowl.
2. (Vinaigrette) In a separate bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard
and garlic. Slowly whisk in oil. Toss with salad
3. Place salad on 6 plates and top with 2 parmesan brittles. Serve
rest seperately.
PARMESAN BRITTLE: These delectable biscuits are wonderful with the
salad but
can also be served with soups or as an hors d'oeuvre. Let them cool
for a few
minutes before removing them from cookie sheet. They are quite
brittle, so if
they break, don't worry. Serve them anyway.
1. Preheat oven to 375F(190C). By hand or in a food processor, cut
butter into flour. Grate your own Parmesan cheese if possible -
consistency will be
better. Mix in Parmesan, paprika, pepper and salt. Form into a ball.
2. On a floured board with a floured rolling pin, roll dough out into
a rectangle approx 12x7 inch (30x18cm) in size. Cut into 1 inch
(2.5cm) strips.
Lay strips onto a cookie sheet. Bake on middle rack for 9-10 minutes
or until
strips are pale gold. Cook on cookie sheet. Serve with salad. (Makes
10-12)
