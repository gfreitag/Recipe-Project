Title: PEACH ICE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
12    Peaches
3    Egg whites
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
Make a syrup and add well-mashed fresh peaches.  When frozen add
beaten whites and finish as directed.

Or peel and quarter fresh peaches, add syrup and put at once
in mold, having first placed some of the slices of peaches in
bottom of mold; cover, bind and pack for five or six hours;
cream and sugar may be used instead of the syrup, making *Peaches and
Cream Ice*. Whipping the cream is an addition.
