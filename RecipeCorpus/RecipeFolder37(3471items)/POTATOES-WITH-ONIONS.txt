Boil potatoes in their jackets. Peel them and mash coarsely with
a fork or hand masher.
Heat the oil in a 10-12 inch skillet over medium heat. When hot,
first put in it the asafetida; after it has sizzled for a few
seconds, add the cumin and mustard seeds; then in 10 seconds or so,
the red pepper(s). Use 1 for mildly hot, 3 for very hot. When pepper
changes color (1 to 5 seconds), put in the chopped onions and
turmeric. After the onions have cooked 3 to 5 minutes and turned
brown at the edges, put in the mashed potatoes, salt, garam masala
and lemon juice. Fry, stirring and mixing, for 5 to 7 minutes.

rounds.

Note 1: the Indian name of this dish is Pyazwale Sookhe Aloo. Note 2:
use a salt-substitute instead of salt Note 3: I've made this without
the asafetida because I don't know where
to find it.
