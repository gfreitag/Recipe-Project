Title: CLASSIC SWISS CHEESE FONDUE
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings  1    Garlic clove, cut in half
2 c  Dry white wine, Neuchatel,
~ Rhine or Chablis
1 lb Emmenthaler or Gruyere, or a
~ mix, finely cut not grated
3 tb Corn starch
3 tb Kirsh or brandy
Salt
Black pepper
1 pn Nutmeg
2    Loaves crusty French or
Italian bread (baguettes)

Rub an earthenware casserole or chafing dish or fondue pot with cut
garlic. Pour in wine and bring to a simmer over low heat; DO NOT BOIL.
Gradually stir in cheese bits (grated cheese tends to lump). When
melted, stir in corn starch that has been dissolved in Kirsh. Add
salt, pepper and nutmeg; stir and bring to a simmer. Keep cheese
bubbling lightly over LOW heat or it will toughen.
If it becomes too thick, add a little preheated wine. If it
separates, add 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch dissolved in a little
wine, then warm slightly.
Serve with bread cubes that guests can spear on fondue forks, then
dip into the cheese mixture. Serve a tossed salad on the side and
offer fruit for dessert. Accompany with Kirsh, neuchatel wine or beer.
