Title: Petticoat Tails
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 c  Soft butter
1 1/2 c  Sifted powdered sugar
1 ts Vanilla or rose water
2 1/2 c  Sifted flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
This is my all-time favorite cookie.  It has a light buttery taste
that is wonderful for a light dessert with perhaps a fruit salad.
You really have to use butter, though.  Doesn't taste nearly as good
if you use margarine.  Just learn to ignore the sound of your
arteries slamming shut.

I got this recipe from the mother of an old friend of mine.  Every
time I make it, I think of dear Mrs. Cassel and Diane, my friend of
35 years.

Beat butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy.

Sift flour with baking soda and salt.  Add to butter mixture to make a
soft dough.  Refrigerate 30 minutes.

Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide in half.  Shape
each half into a roll 8 inches long (about 2 inches in diameter).

Wrap in waxed paper and refigerate several hours or overnight.

Pregeat oven to 375 degrees F.  Slice the roll thinly (about 1/4
inch). Place on an ungreased cookie sheet 1 inch apart.  Bake
8 - 10 minutes (watch carefully - don't want them too brown on the
bottom - you'll have to experiment with your oven to get the time
right). Allow cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes
before removing from the sheet to a wire rack.  Store in an airtight
container...if they last long enough to store (I know they don't last
long at my house).
