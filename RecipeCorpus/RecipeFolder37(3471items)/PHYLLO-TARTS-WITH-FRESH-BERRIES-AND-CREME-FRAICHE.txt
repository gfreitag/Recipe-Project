CREME FRAICHE : In a small bowl, stir 1 1/2 cups whipping cream with
1/3 c granulated sugar, yogurt and  lemon juice until  blended and
most of the sugar is dissolved. Cover loosely with  cheesecloth or
kitchen cloth. Let stand at room temperature until thickened, about
24 hours. Then line a sieve with a double layer of cheesecloth or a
thin kitchen cloth. Place the sieve over a bowl and pour the
thickened creme fraiche into the sieve. Refrigerate the bowl with the
liquid until the liquid is drained off and the creme fraiche is as
thick as ricotta cheese, about 2 hours. Discard the drained liquid.
Remove the thickened creme fraiche from the cheesecloth and place it
in a bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use. PHYLLO SHELLS: Preheat the
oven to 350F. To prepare the phyllo tarts, melt the butter over low
heat. Lay the 4 sheets of phyllo on the counter. Cover the entire
surface of the phyllo sheets with wax paper and a damp kitchen cloth
to prevent them from drying out and cracking.
Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the counter and brush it with melted
butter. Carefully lay another sheet of phyllo over the first so that
the corners match perfectly. Brush with more butter. Cover with
remaining two sheets of phyllo, brushing each with melted butter.
Cut the phyllo into 12 4 X 3 inch rectangles. Lightly butter 12
large muffin or tart tins, approximately 3 inches wide. Carefully
place the phyllo rectangles into the muffin cups, pressing them into
the bottom to form a tart shell. Keep the edges of the phyllo
upright, do not fold them over. Prick the bottom of the shells with a
fork.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until the edges are crisp and brown.
Immediately remove the phyllo sheets from the muffin tins and cool
them on a rack. The shells can made up to a day before serving. Store
them in an airtight container at room temperature. Do not refrigerate.
FILLING: In a small mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, beat 1/2 cup
whipping cream  with 2 Tbsp granulated sugar and vanilla until soft
peaks form when the beaters are lifted. Fold in the Creme Fraiche
just until blended. Refrigerate until ready to use.
RASPBERRY COULIS: Place raspberries and lemon juice in a blender or
processor. Whirl (using on -off motion) until smooth. Strain the
remove the seeds. (Taste and add sugar if needed). Refrigerate if not
using right away.
ASSEMBLY: Just before serving, spoon 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of creme
fraiche filling into each phyllo shell. Arrange a mixture of berries
on top. Sprinkle with icing sugar. Spoon 3 Tbsp Raspberry Coulis onto
each plate. Place the filled phyllo tarts on top of Raspberry Coulis
and garnish with mint if desired. Serve immediately.
