To make quenelles, grind pike in food processor, or use a tamis if

& beat in 1 egg. Cool mixture, then refrigerate until cold. Remove
mixture from refrigerator & blend it in food processor until smooth.
This is the panade.

Cream butter in small bowl. Put ground pike in bowl that is set inside
another bowl of ice. Season w/salt & pepper, mix in panade, &
gradually add other whole egg & all egg yolks. When blended well, add
butter. This can be done in food processor if all ingreds are kept
cold. Chill mixture for 30 mins.
