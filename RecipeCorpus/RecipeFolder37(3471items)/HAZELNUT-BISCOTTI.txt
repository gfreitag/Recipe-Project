Title: HAZELNUT BISCOTTI
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 servings
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Flour, plus 2 tbsp
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Hazelnuts
1/2 c  Butter, sweet
1 c  Sugar
Lemon zest
2    Egg
Preheat oven to 350-F. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and
toast in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until fragrant. Place the nuts
in a dish towel and rub them together to remove some of the skin.
Coarsely chop the hazelnuts and set aside.

In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat the butter at
medium speed until soft and creamy. Add the sugar and lemon zest and
beat until the mixture is very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then beat in the vanilla.

In a medium bowl, toss the flour, baking powder and salt. Gradually
add the flour mixture to the butter, beating on low speed until a
smooth dough forms. Using a wooden spoon, work in the hazelnuts until
evenly distributed.

Divide the dough in half in the bowl. With lightly floured hands,
form the dough into two 10-by-2 inch rectangular logs. Place the logs
on an ungreased baking sheet, at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 30
minutes, or until the logs are set and golden brown. Remove from the
oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 15 minutes.

Using a serrated knife and a sawing motion, carefully cut the logs
into 1/2-inch diagonal slices. discard the end pieces. Arrange the
slices, cut sides down and close together, on 2 baking sheets. Bake
the biscotti on the top and middle racks of the oven for 8 to 9
minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn the biscotti over, switch the
position of the baking sheets and continue baking until lightly
browned on the other side, about 9 minutes longer. Let the biscotti
cool completely on the baking sheets.
