Oh yes I do!!!!!  Have you tried to pound seasoned flour to the round
steak and cut into small steak sized pieces??  All you do is use a
tenderizer hammer and pound seasoned flour into the steak (use garlic
powder, seasoning salt, and pepper mixed with some flour).  Then you
sear the steaks in a skillet to brown. Add some potatoes, carrots,
celery, and a small onion cut into 1 inch cubes, add a can of tomato
sauce and can of cream of mushroom soup and just a little of water to
the meat and simmer about 2 hours on low heat and presto.... you have
swiss steaks or a pot roast.  I just made this over the weekend and it
is sooooo yummy!!!!  Happy cooking to you.
