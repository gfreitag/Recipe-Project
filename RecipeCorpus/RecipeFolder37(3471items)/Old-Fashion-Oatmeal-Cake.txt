Title: Old Fashion Oatmeal Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Brown sugar
&1/3 cup All-purpose flour
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Baking Soda
1 ts Vanilla Extract
6    Eggs,beaten
1 c  Quacker's Old Fashion Oats
1/2 c  Butter or margarine or
-Butter Flavored Crisco
&1/2 cup Boiling!! water
-Meanwhile,in a large
-mixing bowl combine...
1 c  Granulated white sugar
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour,(or use Baker's Joy
spray coating),a 9"x13" cake pan. With an electic mixer,(or a strong
arm),combine the "Oatmeal Mixture" and the above ingredients,mix well.
Pour into prepared pan and bake until toothpick comes out clean.If you
have a problem with the surface of your cake over browning before the
center is done,try covering the cake with aluminum foil after the top
has raised and browned..it works! The cake will turn out perfect
every time. This cake does not rise much,you may wish to either use a
smaller pan,(8"x 8"),or do as I do and double the recipe.A doubled
recipe will rise to the top of a 9"x13" pan. I use Pillsbury Coconut
Pecan Frosting mix,the variety that requires cooking, not the
ready-to-use variety.

Look Mom I'm Eating My Oatmeal!!!
