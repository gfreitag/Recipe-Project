Pork roast
Use half the mojo to marinate your pork roast, piercing the meat
first and placing it in a zip-lock bag overnight in the refrigerator.
Drain the marinade and roast at 325 degrees using a meat thermometer.
Use the remainder of the mojo for a table sauce.

Traditionally, Cubans eat boiled yucca, a kind of root tasting like
potato.  It is dressed with mojo also.  We also eat black beans and
rice and a green salad to complete our Christmas meal.  Enjoy.
