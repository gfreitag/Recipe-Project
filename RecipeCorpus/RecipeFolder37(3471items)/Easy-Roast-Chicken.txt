Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper
Oil for V-rack
1    Roasting chicken
(about 3 lb) *
2 tb Butter, melted
* giblets removed and reserved for another use, chicken rinsed and
patted dry with paper towels.

1. Place shallow roasting pan in oven and heat oven to 375 F. Brush
chicken with butter and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.

2. Remove heated pan from oven and set oiled V-rack in it. Place
chicken on rack, wing side up. Roast 20 min, then rotate chicken,
other wing side up. Roast 20 min, then rotate chicken breast side up.
Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted in breast registers 160
F and in thigh register between 165 F and 170 F, 10-15 min longer.
Transfer chicken to cutting board; let rest 20 min. Carve and serve.

Notes: A 3 1/2 pound bird should roast in 55-60 min while a 4-4 1/2
pound bird requires 60-65 min. If using a V-rack, be sure to grease
it so the chicken doesn't stick to it. if you don't have a V-rack,
set the bird on a regular rack and use balls of aluminum foil to keep
it the roasting chicken propped up on its side.
