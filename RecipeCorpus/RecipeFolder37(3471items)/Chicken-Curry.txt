CHICKEN CURRY

After its independence, Israel discovered a new Jewish community--the
Cochin
Jews of India.  Tradition has it that these Jews were exiled to India
after the destruction of the Second Temple.  Though outwardly
resembling Indians, the Cochin Jews maintain their distinctive
tradition.  One of their principal dishes is chicken curry which has
now been incorporated into Israeli cuisine.

Cut chicken into serving pieces and fry in 1 tbs. oil until lightly
browned.
Add water and simmer for 20 minutes until chicken pieces are tender.
Drain and put aside.  Add onions, garlic, tomatoes, parsley and
apples (all diced)
to the frying pan and saut  over medium heat.  Add sugar, ginger and
curry powder. Sprinkle with flour and pour in clear broth or coconut
milk.  Add coconut and chicken and saute for an additional 10 minutes
over medium heat.
Serve hot with rice.
