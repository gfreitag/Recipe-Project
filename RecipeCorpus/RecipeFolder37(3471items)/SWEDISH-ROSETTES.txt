Title: SWEDISH ROSETTES
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 36 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Flour
1 lb Shortening
2    Egg;
2 tb Sugar
1 c  Milk
Blend dry ingredients. Add milk and egg and beat until smooth like
heavy cream.  Strain mixture. Heat rosette iron in 400 F. fat 3
inches deep in a small saucepan or automatic deep fryer. An auto
fryer is best as it is easier to keep the fat at the correct
temperature.

Tap excess oil off of iron batter on a paper towel. Dip iron in batter
until 2/3 covered. Immerse in hot fat and fry until delicatley brown.
Remove; tip upside down to drain. Push off rosette and drain on paper
towels. Stir batter each time before dipping iron. Repeat. If iron is
too cool, batter will slip off. Dust with powdered sugar and store
airtight, in single layers seperated by wax paper. Best if served
within a day or two (if they last as long as 2 days!).
