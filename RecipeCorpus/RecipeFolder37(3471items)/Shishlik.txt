SHISHLIK
========
The simple method of preparing meat on an open grill goes back to
ancient biblical times.  To this day, Israelis tend to prefer their
meat prepared in
this manner.  Shishlik is one of the most popular dishes requested at
restaurants.

Marinate diced meat (1 in. x 1 in.) in garlic and oil mixture for 1/2
hour. Remove and put meat on skewers.  Sprinkle on salt and pepper.
Place over charcoal or in broiler.
