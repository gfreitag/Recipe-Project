Title: Orange Julius (No Egg)
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Sugar *
1 ts Vanilla extract
8    To 9 ice cubes
6 oz Frozen orange juice
-concentrate
1 c  Milk
1 c  Water
Once I got this recipe, I never bought another Orange Julius. These
are much better, IMHO!

* (this is *way* too much, IMO....I use 1 Tablespoon, if any)

Combine all ingredients except ice cubes in blender.  Blend for about
1-2 minutes, adding ice cubes one at a time.

I've used other frozen juice flavors....some of the tropical blends
are great!  You can also increase the milk and decrease the water to
make it richer.  Or add an egg.  (I *lived* on these after having my
wisdom teeth pulled!  They're also great if you have a sore
throat....with an egg for protein, you get a fairly nutritious drink!)
