DOUGH SETTING Special instructions: If dough is too sticky because of
oil; add up to 1/2 cup flour by Tablespoons until you reach the
correct consistency.

After the dough has completed the first rising,remove from b/m and
punch down. Cover on lightly floured board and allow to rest 5-10
minutes.
Spray a 9x13x2 pan with Pam, or brush with olive oil. Briefly knead
dough and spread into pan, using hands to acheive a "bumpy texture".
Form a low ridge around the edge of the dough. Push dough into
corners. The bumps and ridge will allow the topping to stay in place.
Brush surface with olive oil.
You can cover and allow to rise, and bake  at this stage, or
continue on for Tomato & Cheese topping. TOPPING: Combine tomato
paste and spaghetti sauce. Spread on dough. Combine remaining
ingredients. Spread evenly over sauce. Press gently into dough. Cover
& allow to rise til doubled.
Preheat oven to 375.
Bake 25 minutes.
Slide out of pan onto cutting board. Cut into small pieces for
appetizers or large wedges for dinner.
