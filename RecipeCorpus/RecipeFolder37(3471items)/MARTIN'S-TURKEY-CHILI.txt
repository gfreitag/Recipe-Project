Title: MARTIN'S TURKEY CHILI
Categories: Main dish, Chili
Yield: 1 servings
1 sm Green pepper, chopped
1    28-oz can crushed tomatoes
1/2 c  Water
4 tb Chili powder
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Whole cumin seed
1 c  Black beans
3 tb Olive oil
1    Turkey breast (half breast),
-skinned
4 md Yellow onions, chopped
4    Cloves garlic, minced
3    Ribs celery, sliced
Top with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream OR chopped ripe
avocado

1.  Soak the beans overnight in water to cover generously.  Drain and
rinse briefly.

2.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy bottom pot over medium high heat.
When hot, brown the turkey breast well on all sides.  Remove and set
aside.

3.  Add the onions, garlic, celery, and green pepper.  Saute, stirring
frequently, until the vegetables are soft, 5-7 minutes.

4.  Add the beans, tomatoes, water, chili powder, cayenne, and the
turkey breast.  Heat until the pot starts bubbling, then reduce heat
to a slow simmer, partially cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hour.  Stir
occasionally, watching carefully that the bottom does not start to
stick.

5.  Remove the turkey breast, remove the bone, and coarsely shred the
meat with two forks (hold the meat with one fork, tear with the grain
with the other.) Return the meat to the pot.

6.  Heat a heavy bottom skillet over low heat.  Add the whole cumin
seed and toast 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until
lightly brown and aromatic.  Remove from heat.  Coarsely crush the
cumin in a mortar and pestle or with a rolling pin.  Add to the pot.

7.  Cook an additional one hour, or until the beans are tender.

8.  For the traditional approach, top with the cheese and sour cream;
for the modern/healthy approach, top with the avocado.
