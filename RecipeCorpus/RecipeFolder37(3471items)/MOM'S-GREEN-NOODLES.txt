Pepper, freshly ground
Sour cream

1/2 c  Butter

Cook the noodles; reserve.  Melt butter in a large saucepan.  In the
blender, liquefy "3 to 4 times as much parsley as you'd think you'd
need" with "the least amount of water possible."  Add to melted
butter with salt, MSG and "plenty" of black pepper.  Add sour cream
until good sauce, about a cup; blend.  (Don't heat sour cream too
much because it might curdle.)  Add grated cheese(s) and pressed
garlic, then noodles.
