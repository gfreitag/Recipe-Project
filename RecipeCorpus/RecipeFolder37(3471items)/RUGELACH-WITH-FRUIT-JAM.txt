Title: RUGELACH WITH FRUIT JAM
Categories: Pastry, Cake/cookie, Jewish
Yield: 48 pastries
6 tb Raisins; chopped
6 tb Walnuts; chopped
3/4 c  Jam (apricot, strawberry, or
-raspberry)
1    Egg yolk
1 tb ;Water
1/2 lb Butter; softened
6 oz Cream cheese; room temp
3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Cinnamon
Combine the butter & cream cheese & beat until well mixed. Add the
flour & salt & mix until completely blended. The dough will be easier
to handle if you wrap & chill it for about an hour. Stir together 1/2
C. sugar & the cinnamon. Add the raisins & walnuts & toss to coat all
the pieces. Preheat oven to 375 degrees & get out some cookie sheets.
Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Keep chilled any dough you are
not working on. Roll 1 of the pieces into an 8" circle. Spread with 2
Tbsp. jam & sprinkle with 2 Tbsp. of the sugar-raisin-nut mixture.
Cut into 8 pie- shaped wedges. Beginning at the wide end, roll toward
the point, & form a crescent shape. Roll out & form the remaining
dough in the same way. Place the cookies, point side down, about 1"
apart on the ungreased cookie sheets. Mix together the egg yolk &
water & brush over the top of each cookie. Sprinkle each cookie with
a little of the remaining 1/4 C. sugar. Bake for about 15 minutes or
until lightly golden. Remove from oven & transfer to racks to cool.
