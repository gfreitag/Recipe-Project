10 minutes.
Stir the reserved meat into the onions.  Add the tomato juice, 3
cups of water, the chili powder, cumin, oregano, cocoa, cinnamon, and
salt (optional). Blend. Turn the heat to high and bring to the boil;
reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour.  Stir occasionally.
Taste for seasoning.  Add more chili powder if you like your chili
really searing.  Cook 30 minutes longer. Stir in the garlic,
cornmeal, and beans. Simmer for 10 minutes more until the beans are
heated through.
