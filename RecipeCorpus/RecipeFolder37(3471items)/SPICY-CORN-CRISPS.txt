Categories: Snacks
Yield: 150 crackers
2 tb Margarine
1 c  Boiling water
1 1/3 c  All purpose flour
Salt for the tops
Paprika for the tops
1 c  Cornmeal
1    Garlic clove, pressed
1 1/2 ts Cayenne
1 1/2 ts Cumin
1 1/2 ts Chili powder
1/4 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 375F.
In a large bowl, combine cornmeal, garlic, cayenne, cumin, chili
powder & salt.  Add margarine & boiling water & blend well.  Allow
mixture to cool & rest for 10 minutes.  It wil thicken slightly.
Slowly blend in the flour, using just enough to form a dough.  Divide
it into 3 equal portions.  Roll out as thinly as possible.  Sprinkle
lightly with salt & paprika & roll over the top with the rolling pin.
Cut dough into 2" triangles or squares.  Arrange on an ungreased
cookie sheet & bake for 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool on a rack.  They will
crisp as they cool.  If not crisp enough, return to the oven for a
few minutes longer & allow them to cool again.
Serve with a salsa dip.
