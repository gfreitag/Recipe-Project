Title: DATE NUT ROLL
Categories: Desserts, Candies
Yield: 7 servings
1 c  Chopped nuts
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Milk
Cook sugar, cream, and milk to 230 degrees F.. Slowly add chopped
dates so boiling does not stop. Occasionally, stir mixture so the
dates do not settle to the bottom of the pan and scorch. Cook to 238
degrees F.. Cool in the pan or pour out on a marble slab. When a
little warmer than lukewarm, around 150 degrees, stir and work with
your hands or a spatula until creamy. Work nuts and vanilla into the
candy. Form into rolls, wrap tightly in waxed paper or plastic wrap
until firm. Store in a tightly covered container. Makes about 30
pieces.
