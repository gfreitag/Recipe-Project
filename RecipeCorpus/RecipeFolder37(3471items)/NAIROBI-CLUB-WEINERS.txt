Yield: 999 servings
1 pk KC Masterpeice BBQ sauce
4 pk Hot Dogs (meat/beef)
1 cn Beer
Chicken hot dogs won't work, beef works best but "meat" one are ok.
Cut hot dogs into 1" pieces and put in crock pot.  Cover with beer, I
use the cheap stuff. cover and cook for several hours, until the dogs
plump up. drain off beer and cover with BBQ sauce.  Cook a couple of
more hours. This is much better than it sounds.  Kids will generally
hate it, but adults will inhale it. I know...it's *hot dogs*, but
this is different.

Recipe from the kitchen of Joan Mershon.
