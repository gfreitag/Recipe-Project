Title: OYSTER LOAF - LA MDIATRICE
Categories: Main dish, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
Tabasco Sauce
Hot Heavy Cream (Optional)
1    French Bread, 12" Long
1/3 c  Melted Butter
1 pt Shucked Oysters, Drained
Preheat oven to 425 øF.
Cut off the top of the bread lengthwise, scoop out most of the bread
of the bottom half, leaving a shell about 3/4" thick.  Brush the
inside of the bottom and the cut side of the top with melted butter.
Put the loaf and "lid," cut sides up, on an ungreased baking sheet,
bake until toasted golden brown, about 20 minutes (the lid will be
done first; check that it does not overcook).
Meanwhile, saut the oysters in hot butter until plump.  Add salt,
pepper, a dash of Tabasco, and, if desired, a little hot cream.  Fill
the loaf with the hot fried oysters and put the lid on top.  Heat for
10 minutes or until ready to serve.  Cut in thick slices if the loaf
is long.
NOTE:  Individual rolls can also be used: allow about 3 oysters for
each one.  The amount of oysters required for this recipe varies
according to the size of the oysters and the size of the loaf of
bread.  In any case, the bread "basket" should be filled to the top
with oysters.
