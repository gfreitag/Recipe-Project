Title: Black Bean Soup with Bananas
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 quarts
1 tb Herbes de Provence
1 tb Chili powder
1 cn (14oz) chopped tomatoes
Salt
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Red wine vinegar
1 1/2 ts Tabasco sauce
4    Ripe bananas
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Fresh ground pepper
1 lb Dried black beans
Picked over, rinsed
Soaked overnight in
Cold water to cover
1/2 c  Brown rice (4oz)
3/4 lb Lean pancetta or bacon
Cut into 1/4" dice
2 md Onion(s)
Cut into 1" dice
8    Garlic clove(s)
Coarsely chopped
1. Drain and rinse the beans and put them in a large heavy saucepan or
casserole. Add the rice, pancetta, and 3 quarts of cool water and
bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Skim any foam
that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to very low, cover and
simmer for 1 hour.

2. Stir in the onions, garlic, herbes de Provence, chili powder,
tomatoes, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to very low,
cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours longer.

3. Using a handheld electric mixer, beat the soup for 5-10 seconds to
emulsify it a bit. Or, puree 2 cups of the soup in a food processor or
blender, then return it to the saucepan. The point is to thicken the
soup somewhat while maintaining its overall chunkiness.

Let the soup cool, then refrigerate for up for 5 days or freeze.
Reheat before proceeding.

4. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar and Tabasco, then
stir the mixture into the soup. Slice the bananas  1/4-inch thick and
place in a bowl. Toss with the lemon juice and sprinkle with the
pepper. Serve the soup in bowls and pass the bananas separately.
