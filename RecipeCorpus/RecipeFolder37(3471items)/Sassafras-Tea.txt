Title: Sassafras Tea
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 servings
1 ga Water
4    Average-sized sassafras
- roots
You can gather the roots for sassafras tea anytime of year, but the
roots should be young and tender.  Chop the young roots from the tree
and wash them in cold water.  Scrape off the outer layer of bark.
The bark can also be used to make tea, but the roots are better.
They can be used dry or green.  Bring the roots to a boil in water.
The  longer they boil, the stronger the tea.
To make a gallon, boil 4 average-sized roots in a gallon of water for
15-20 minutes.  Strain and drink hot or iced, sweetened with sugar or
honey.
