This is a recipe handed down from my husband's family. I believe it is
Spanish in origin, but not exactly sure.

Wash spinach, put in pot to boil for just one minute. Drain until
water has been removed. Put in bowl, add eggs, mix well. Add grated
cheese, garlic, bread crumbs, salt and pepper.
Preheat pan on high temp. Put ingredients in pan and lower heat.
When looks done, turn over until cooked through.

Enjoy!
