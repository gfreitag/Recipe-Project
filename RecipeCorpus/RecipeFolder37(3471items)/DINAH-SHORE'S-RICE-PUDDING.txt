Title: DINAH SHORE'S RICE PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Snacks
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Raisins
1/2 ts Vanilla
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Cinnamon
1/2 c  Regular rice
1 c  Water (slightly salted)
1 qt Whole milk
1/4 c  Butter
3    Eggs
Slowly pour rice into rapidly boiling, slightly salted water in a
large pot. DO NOT STIR! Cover tightly and cook exactly seven minutes,
at which time all the water will be absorbed and the rice will be
slightly undone.

Add the milk and butter; stir a little. Bring to a boil, cover and
cook slowly over a low flame for one hour.

Meanwhile, beat eggs; add 1/2 up sugar, raisins and vanilla. pour the
mixture into the rice, stiring slowly until the rice starts to
thicken.

Serve hot, warm or cold with a mixture of the cinnamon and remaining
sugar sprinkled lightly and evenly over the top.

MARGIE'S NOTES: As printed the pudding comes out very sweet, and with
too many raisins for my taste. So I change the rice from 1/2 cup to 1
cup, and change the water to 2 cups. This of course changes the
servings to more, but with Gary around, it all goes anyway.
