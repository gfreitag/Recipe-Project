Title: FRESH TOMATO-VEGETABLE SOUP
Categories: Soup/stew, Pasta/rice, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 c  Corn kernels
4 1/2 c  Vegetable broth
3/4 ts Salt
5 ts Basil, chopped
1/2 c  Small pasta shells, uncooked
Black pepper, to taste
6 md Tomatoes
3/4 c  Red onions, chopped
3/4 c  Celery, diced, include tops
4 ts Olive oil
3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
3/4 c  Zucchini, diced
Plunge the tomatoes into boiling water & then into iced water to
remove their skins.  Chop the tomatoes & set aside.
In a stockpot, saute the onions & celery in the oil over medium heat
until tender, 5 minutes.  Stir in the garlic, zucchini, corn & saute
for another 2 minutes.
Add the broth & bring to a boil.  Add the tomatoes, salt & basil.
Reduce the heat, cover & simmer for 15 minutes, stirring
occasionally.  Add the pasta, cover & simmer for 30 minutes (Seems
rather a long time to me!). Sprinkle with the pepper & serve hot.
