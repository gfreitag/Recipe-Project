Categories: Chinese, Meats, Appetizers
Yield: 10 servings
1    Garlic clove, crushed
2 lb Country-style pork ribs
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
4 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Honey
2 tb Sherry
2 tb Pineapple sauce
Cut pork into strips 1x1-1/2 inches and 5 inches long.
Combine 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 Tbsp. sugar, sprinkle the mixture on the
pork strips.  Let stand for at least 2 hours. In a bowl, combine the
rest of the ingredients.
Wipe pork strips dry with paper towels and marinate in the sauce for
at least 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Remove pork from
marinade, reserving the liquid. Place pork on a rack in a roasting
pan lined with heavy aluminum foil.  Bake in 400 degree oven for 20
minutes. Remove from oven, dip in marinade and roast another 20
minutes. Remove pork again, dip in marinade.  Return to oven and turn
the heat down to 250 degrees F. and roast 20 more minutes.
Dip in mixture for the last time and roast 15 to 20 minutes. Turn
the oven off and let the pork set in oven for 20 minutes. Slice pork
about 1/8-in thick and serve with dipping sauce. DIPPING SAUCE: Hot
mustard paste (dry mustard mixed with a few drops of water to form a
paste-like texture), combined with 1 tsp. soy sauce.
