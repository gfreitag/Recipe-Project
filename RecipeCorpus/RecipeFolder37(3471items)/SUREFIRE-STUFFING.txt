Categories: Poultry, Holiday, Breads
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Fresh thyme, chopped**
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper, freshly ground
2 x  Eggs
3/4 c  Chicken stock***
1 1/2 x  Loaves Italian Bread*
1 c  Pecan pieces (4 oz)
4 oz Unsalted butter
Large onion, finely chopped
2 x  Celery ribs, peeled/minced
1/2 c  Flat-leaf parsley, chopped
*   about 1 pound ** or 2 ts dried *** or canned broth
Cut off 1 inch from the loaves of bread and trim of the bottom
crusts. Cut the remaining bread into 1/2-inch cubes and spread out on
a baking sheet. Let dry overnight, uncovered. Preheat oven to 400
degrees. Spread the pecans on a small cookie sheet and toast in the
oven, stirring once or twice, for about 7 minutes, until fragrant.
Let cool. In a large heavy skillet, melt the butter over moderately
high heat. Add the onion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally,
until softened but not browned, about 10 minutes. Place the dried
bread cubes in a large bowl. Add the contents of the skillet to the
bread along with the toasted pecans, parsley, thyme, salt, and
pepper. Toss well to combine. In a small bowl, lightly beat the eggs
with the chicken stock until blended. Pour the egg mixture over the
ingredients in the bowl and mix until well blended. Let cool
completely before using.
