LATKES
======
Originating in eastern Europe, latkes (potato pancakes) have been a
staple of the Jewish diet for many years.  Eaten especially during
the festivals of
Hanukah and Passover, these light and scrumptious treats continue to
be a favorite on the Israeli menu.

Grate potatoes.  Mix in egg, flour, salt and pepper.  Grated onion
may be added for flavor.  Form into patties and fry until brown on
both sides (about 2 minutes for each side).  Serve with apple sauce
or sour cream.
