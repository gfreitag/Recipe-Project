I have a Hitachi 101, and this recipe has been successful.  It makes
a 7 inch tall loaf.  This is a soft fluffy loaf.

Other bread machines will have to alter to manufacturers guidelines.

Have all ingredients at room temperature.

Mix the pumpkin, water and butter in glass mixing cup.  Microwave on
high for approx. 60 seconds.  Test to make sure the liquid is warm to
the touch. Because the pumpkin is very dense, it may have to be
zapped a bit longer. If liquid gets too warm, pour into machine bread
pan and stir with rubber spatula so the coolness of the pan can cool
down the liquid.

Add ingredients to bread pan according to manufacturers directions.

About 5 minutes into the mixing cycle check to see if the dough is too
sticky - if so you may have to add additional flour, one teaspoon at a
time.  After the rest cycle, and the kneading starts up again, check
again for texture.  This dough usually runs a*little*bit sticky.
Start adding the raisins about 12 minutes into the cycle.  (Adding
them at the beeper on my machine sometimes makes the raisins gather
at the bottom of the pan and they refuse to blend into the dough).

Bake on "mix bread" cycle, with Light Crust setting.

*** Depending on humidity more flour may be needed 1 teaspoon at a
time.
(see above)

I have not tried this on a delayed timer, or on rapid rise.

The end result is a bread that tastes like pumpkin pie and raisins.
