Title: Broccoli with Oyster Sauce
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Sunflower Oil ( or soya oil)
4 tb Oyster or Soy Sauce
1 lb Broccoli
1    Clove Garlic
1/2 inch piece fresh ginger
Trim the broccoli and cut the heads off very close to the tips. Slice
the stalks across on the diagonal into quarter inch pieces. Split the
head into pieces no bigger than a walnut. Peel and finely chop the
garlic and ginger. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok and fry
the garlic and ginger for one minute. Add the broccoli stalks and fry
for a minute and a half. Add two Tablespoons of water - be careful,
it will spit and give off lots of steam - then add the broccoli
florets. They will turn a wonderful bright green. Stir fry for
another two minutes over a medium to high heat until the vegetables
are cooked and the liquid has vanished. Remove the pan from the heat
and pour the oyster or soy sauce over the broccoli, turning it so it
is well coated in the rich, dark sauce. Check for seasoning and serve
really hot.
