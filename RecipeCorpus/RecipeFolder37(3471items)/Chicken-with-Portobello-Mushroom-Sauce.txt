Title: Chicken with Portobello Mushroom Sauce
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 servings
8 md Chicken breast halves
Boneless, with skin on
1 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Heavy cream
3 lg Portobello mushrooms
Stems discarded
2 tb Plus 1 tsp
Olive oil
Salt and pepper
1. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Arrange the mushrooms, stemmed sides
down, on a baking sheet. Brush the mushrooms with 1 tsp olive oil and
season with salt and pepper. Roast for about 12 min, or until tender.
Thinly slice the mushrooms and transfer to a plate.

2. Heat the remaining 2 tbs olive oil in a large nonreactive skillet.
Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and add
half the breasts to the skillet, skin sides down. Cook over
moderately high heat, turning once, until well browned, about 5 min.
Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.
Return all the chicken to the skillet, lower the heat to moderate,
cover and cook until opaque throughout, about 5 min longer. Transfer
the chicken to a large plate and keep warm.

3. Add the white wine to the skillet and boil over high heat,
stirring to scrape up any browned bits, until reduced by half, about
5 min. Add the chicken stock and reduce by half, about 3 min. Add the
cream and continue boiling until reduced by half, about 3 min more.
Stir in the sliced mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Set
each chicken breast on a large plate and spoon the sauce over.
