This is a subtle and tasty sweet-and-sour sauce which can be used for
any deep-fried foods, such as the Fried Wonton. It keeps well in a
tightly sealed jar in the refrigerator. COMBINE ALL THE INGREDIENTS
in a small bowl. Be sure to mix them thoroughly. Transfer the mixture
to a small dish if it is to be used at once, or put in a jar and
refrigerate until needed.
