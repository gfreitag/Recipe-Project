MMMMM-------------------------LARGE LOAF------------------------------
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 tb Vital gluten
2 tb Wheat germ
2 ts Yeast
1/3 c  Sunflower seeds; optional
1 1/4 c  -Water
3 tb Margarine
2 1/2 tb Sugar
1 1/3 ts Salt
1/4 c  Potato flakes
1 c  Bread flour
This is a result of my own experimentation.  I cooked it in my Zoji
on on the light crust setting and the basic white bread cycle. I
added the sunflower seeds thirty minutes after starting.

Made a beautiful loaf, almost to the top of the pan. Keeps well and
slices nicely.
