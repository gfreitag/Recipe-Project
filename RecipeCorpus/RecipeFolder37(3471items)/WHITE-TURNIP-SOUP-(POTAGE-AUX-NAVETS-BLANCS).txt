Melt butter in a medium kettle and add chopped turnips and onions.
Saute over medium heat for about 5 minutes or until onions are
translucent. Stir frequently. Bring 6 to 8 cups water to the
boil--the amount depending on how much soup you wish to make, as well
as its desired strength. Pour the boiling water into the turnip/onion
mixture. Break the bread slices into the kettle. Heat the soup to the
boil; reduce heat and simmer for aout 15 minutes or until turnips are
tender when pierced with a fork. Set the soup aside to cool.  Season
with salt, if desired, and pepper. When the soup has cooled
sufficiently, four into a food processor or blender or press through
a sieve with a wooden spoon.  Note: At this point the soup can be
refrigerated for a day or two, or frozen for several weeks. Later the
egg, cream and garnish will be added. Before serving, reheat the
soup--but do not boil--and add the egg yolks beaten with the cream.
Stir constantly until the mixture is blended and creamy. Check
seasoning. Serve in heated soup bowls and garnish with parsley or
chives.
