Title: Stewed Oysters in Milk or Cream
Categories: Fish/seafoo, White house
Yield: 1 batch
2 tb Butter
2 c  Milk; heated nearly to boil
Oyster or Common crackers
2 qt Oysters
3/4 c  Hot water
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Drain the liquor from the oysters;  mix with the liquor the hot
water, add salt and pepper and set over the fire in a saucepan.  Let
it boil up once, put in the oysters, bring swiftly to a boil and when
they "ruffle" add the butter.  The instant it is melted and well
stirred in, add the milk and take the saucepan from the fire.  Serve
with oyster or cream crackers while hot.

If thickening is preferred, stir in a little flour or two tablespoons
of cracker crumbs.
