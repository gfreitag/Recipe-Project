Title: FERNADINA SHRIMP GRAVY (FLORIDA COOKING)
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled, cleaned,-
-and, if large, cut in-
-pieces
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/8 ts Crushed dried red pepper
2 c  Hot cooked rice
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Plus 1 cup water
2 oz Salt pork, diced
1/2 c  Minced onion
1/2 c  Diced green bell pepper
1/2 c  Diced red bell pepper
1/2 c  Diced celery
In a heavy medium-size skillet, stir the sugar over moderate heat
until it begins to melt.  Continue to cook until the syrup turns
golden.  Add the tablespoon of water, protecting your hands with a
pot holder as the hot sugar may spatter.  Stir until the sugar is
dissolved.  Set this caramel aside.

In a large skillet or saute pan, cook the salt pork until browned,
stirring now and then.  Remove the pork bits with a slotted spoon,
and set aside. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of pork drippings.  Add
the onion, green and red peppers, and celery.  Saute until the
vegetables are tender. Add the shrimp and cook until they turn bright
pink and are opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp and vegetables
with a slotted spoon and keep them warm on a plate.  Add the
remaining 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon of the caramel to the pan
drippings.  Bring to a boil, stir, and simmer 1 to 2 minutes. Season
with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper.

Return the shrimp and vegetables and the salt pork bits to the gravey
and heat a minute or two.  Serve hot over rice.
