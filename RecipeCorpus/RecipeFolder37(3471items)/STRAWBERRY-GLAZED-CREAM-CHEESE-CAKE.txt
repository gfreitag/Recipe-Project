until smooth. Add eggs, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla and beat
thoroughly. Spoon over crust. Set pan on baking sheet to catch any
butter that may drip out. Bake 10 inch cake 40 to 45 minutes or 9
inch cake 50 to 55 minutes. (Cake may rise slightly and crack in
several areas; it will settle again, cracks will minimize and topping
will cover it up.)Remove from oven and let stand at room temperature

sour cream, sugar and vanilla and blend well. Cover and refrigerate.
When cake has finished baking, spoon topping over, starting at center

minutes longer. Let cool, then refrigerate cheesecake for at least 24
hours or preferably 2 to 3 days. FOR GLAZE: Several hours before
serving, wash and hull berries and let dry completely on paper
towels. Combine a little jelly with cornstarch in saucepan and mix
well. Add remaining jelly, Cointreau and water and cook over medium
heat, stirring frequently, until thickened and clear, about 5
minutes. Cool to lukewarm, stirring occasionally. Using knife, loosen
cake from pan; remove springform. Arrange berries pointed end up over
top of cake. Spoon glaze over berries, allowing some to drip down
sides of cake. Return to refrigerator until the glaze is set.
