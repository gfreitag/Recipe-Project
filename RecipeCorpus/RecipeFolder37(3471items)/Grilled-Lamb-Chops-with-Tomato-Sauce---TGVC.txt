Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM-------------------------LAMB CHOPS------------------------------
Olive oil
Salt
4 ea Thick lamb chops -OR-
8 ea Small lamb cutlets
Freshly milled black pepper
MMMMM------------------------TOMATO SAUCE-----------------------------
2 ea Cloves (optional)
Salt to taste
1/4 ts Cayenne
2 tb Dry sherry
1/2 c  Chicken or vegetable stock
8 ea Ripe tomatoes
2 tb Olive oil
1 ea Carrot; peeled and chopped

3 ea Shallots; peeled and chopped
Bring a pan of water to a boil. When boiling steadily, plunge in
the tomatoes, then remove them with a slotted spoon after 30 seconds.
Allow them to cool, then remove the skins, which should slip off very
easily. Chop the tomatoes finely, discarding the seeds.  Heat the oil
in a pan. Saute the carrots, celery, and shallots until golden brown.
Add the chopped tomatoes and the remaining sauce ingredients.  Simmer
for 30 minutes, then sieve through a wire strainer into a clean pan.
Set aside.
Preheat a broiler, a cast-iron griddle or a large, heavy frying
pan. Season the chops with black pepper, then dip them in olive oil.
Broil or grill on both sides until done to the required degree of
pinkness. Sprinkle with salt when cooked.  Reheat the sauce briefly
and serve it hot beside the chops, accompanied by mashed or sauteed
potatoes, and a vegetable.
