"The sweetness of the raisins help to balance the heat and spice of
the curry in this pilaf.  I like the monochromatic yellows in the
dish--- yellow rice, golden raisins, and toased almonds---but if you
choose dark raisins, the effect will be dramatic; black raisins
against a background of vibrantly colored rice."

Melt the butter in a large wide saucepan over medium heat.  When the
foam subsides, add the onion and saute over low heat, stirring, until
golden, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the curry, turmeric, rice, and
raisins, and saute 2 minutes more.

Add the chicken broth and heat to boiling, stirring once.  Cook,
covered over medium-low heat until the broth is absorbed and the rice
is tender, about 15 minutes.  Let stand, uncovered, off the heat for
5 minutes before serving.

Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a 350 degree oven about 7 minutes.
Sprinkle over the pilaf just before serving.
