fragrant and coriander seeds are several shades darker, being careful
not to burn them. Cool mixture and grind to a powder. In a bowl stir
together spice powder, turmeric, and water to form a paste.

cut with scissors into  1/2-inch pieces. In a small bowl soak chilies
in warm water to cover for 20 min and drain in a sieve. Puree
chilies, onions, and ginger in a food processor.

In a heavy kettle (at least 5-quarts) heat oil over moderate heat

to separate from puree and puree begins sticking to bottom of kettle.
Add curry paste and cook over moderately low heat, stirring

water to just cover lamb and salt to taste and simmer, covered, 1-1
1/2 hours, or until lamb is tender.

Peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Add potatoes to curry,
making sure they are covered with liquid, and simmer, uncovered,
until tender, about 15 min. Stir in coconut milk, lime juice,
tomatoes, and bell peppers and simmer 5 min. Just before serving add
curry leaves.
