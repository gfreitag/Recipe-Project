Title: Cauliflower-Curry Linguine
Categories: Pasta/rice, Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
3 tb Butter
1 tb Curry powder
Salt and pepper
1    Head of cauliflower
1/2 lb Fresh linguine
4    Green onion(s)
1. Cut up enough of the cauliflower to make 4 cups small florets;
reserve the rest for another use. Cook the cauliflower and the pasta
in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender but still firm,
about 3 min. Ladle out and reserve  1/2 cup cooking water. Drain the
cauliflower and pasta and set aside.

2. While the pasta and cauliflower are cooking, cut the green onions
crosswise into thin slices. Melt the butter in a large frying pan over
medium heat. Reserving 2 tbs of sliced green onion tops for garnish,
cook the remaining green onions and the curry powder in the butter,
stirring often, until softened and fragrant, about 3 min.

3. Add the reserved cooking water and cook 1 min. Add the cooked
pasta and cauliflower to the frying pan and toss well. Season
generously with salt and pepper.
