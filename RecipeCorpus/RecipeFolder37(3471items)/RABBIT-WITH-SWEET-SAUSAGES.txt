sausages until well browned. Remove sausages to cool and slice in
1-inch pieces.
In the browning fat from the sausages, saute the rabbit until
golden. Set aside.  Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat. Add the
garlic, onions, and peppers to the skillet. Saute over a moderately
low flame until the vegetables are tender.
Return the sausage slices to the skillet and add the tomatoes,
dried pepper, tomato paste, wine, basil, oregano, orange juice, zest,
and salt. Simmer for 10 minutes to blend the flavors.
Return the rabbit to the sauce and simmer covered for 20-30
minutes. The rabbit is done when the thickest part of the leg is
pierced with a fork and the juices run clear.  Serve with buttered
pasta or rice.
