TEHINA
======
A typical dish of the Orient brought to Israel by Jewish refugees
from the Arab countries.  Tehina is a thick dip with sesame seeds as
its base.  It is
often used as a topping for falafel and other dishes.

Mix tahini, garlic, water, pepper, salt and lemon juice until you get
smooth
paste.  Add water if tehina is too thick.  Serve as a thin layer on a
small plate, with a drop or two of olive oil, garnish with pickles.
Sprinkle with
parsley or mix the parsley with the dip.
