Grind the meat with bread.  Add the onions which have been sauteed in

the egg with the flour, add a dash of salt and as much water as
needed to knead a smooth loose dough.  Roll out as thinly as you can.
Cut out 2 1/2 to 3 inch squares.  Put a little of the stuffing on
each square.  Fold to form a triangle, pinch the edges together.
Cook in a large kettle with boiling salted water on high heat for 5
minutes.  Remove with a colander spoon to a warmed serving platter.
Add the bread crumbs to the butter and fry for a few minutes on low
heat.  Pour over the perogi.
