Title: STRAWBERRY FRUIT FLAN
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/4 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 lb Fresh strawberries (or more)
3 tb Sugar
1 pk Red transparent glaze
1/2 c  Unsalted margarine
2 tb Unsalted margarine
3/4 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
2 tb Evaporated milk
1/4 ts Vanilla
In small bowl, mix margarine, sugar and eggs until creamy. Add
evaporated milk and vanilla.

In another bowl, sift flour and baking powder together. Stir into
margarine mixture in small amounts.

Grease a 12 inch fruit flan tin with a fluted rim. Sprinkle with
flour. Pour in mixture and spread evenly with a knife.

Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden
brown. Let cool for 10 minutes after removing from oven.

Drain strawberries; reserve juice. Turn cake upside down and fill with
strawberries. (If strawberries are very large, you may want to slice
them in half. Sprinkle with sugar and allow to sit for 1 hour.) Add
the strawberry juice to the glaze mix. Prepare glaze, following
instructions on back of package. (NOTE: If you have accumulated
approximately 1/2 cup of juice from the strawberries, and the glaze
mix requires 1 cup of water, use the 1/2 cup of juice plus 1/2 cup of
water to make 1 cup of liquid.) Pour glaze over strawberries.
