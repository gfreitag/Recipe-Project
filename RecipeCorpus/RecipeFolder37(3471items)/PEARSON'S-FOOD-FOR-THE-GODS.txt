Title: PEARSON'S FOOD FOR THE GODS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Flour
1 ts Flour; opt, see note
2    Eggs; separated
Whipped cream
1 c  Dates; chopped
1 c  Walnuts; broken
3/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
This very sweet dessert was a favorite of former Canadian Prime
Minister and Noble Prize winner, Lester "Mike" Pearson. "Perhaps for
sound political reasons, no member of the household staff (of the
Prime Minister's residence) can remember any specific occasion on
which it was served."

Anne' s note: I chopped the dates in a food processor with the 1 Tbsp
of flour (to prevent stickiness) and then added 1 tsp of flour to the
mixture.

Blend the ingredients (except the eggs) lightly with a fork. Add
unbeaten egg yolks and stir lightly. Fold in stiffly beaten egg
whites. Pour in buttered baking dish and set in a larger pan
partially filled with hot water. Bake at 325F until it becomes light
brown (20-25 minutes). Serve cold with whipped cream. SERVES: 6
