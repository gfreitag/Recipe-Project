Title: Basil Gravlax
Categories: Appetizers, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM----------------------TASTE OF SUMMER---------------------------
2 ts White peppercorns
4 bn Basil, fresh
3 lb Salmon fillets
3 tb Sugar
2 tb Kosher salt
Lay salmon on wax paper.  Combine remaining ingredients. Sprinkle
salmon with half mixture.  Turn and sprinkle other side with
remaining mixture. Press firmly on salmon to coat evenly with
seasonings.  Place 2 bunches of fresh basil on bottom of large,
shallow, non-aluminum pan.  Place salmon on top.  Arrange remaining
basil over salmon.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap,
weight top with heavy pot lid, brick, or large can, and refrigerate.

Turn salmon twice a day for four days.  Make sure basil and
peppercorns remain evenly distributed.

To serve, remove basil and peppercorns.  Lightly pat salmon dry with
paper towel, making sure to remove all salt and sugar. Slice very
thinly on bias and serve garnished with lemon wedges, basil leaves,
Sweet Mustard Basil Sauce, and dark pumpernickel bread.

NOTE:  Gravlax is usually marinated with dill, but this variation
uses the stronger, more aromatic basil as the herb base for the
curing element. The fish is actually cooked (or cured) by the
marinade.

You'll need to start curing four days before you plan to serve
gravlax. Recommended Wine:  A ripe, crisp, fruity Chardonnay will
bring out the basil flavor and neatly balance salmon.
