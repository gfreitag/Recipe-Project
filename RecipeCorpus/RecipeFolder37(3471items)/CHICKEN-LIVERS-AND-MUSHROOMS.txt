Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Appetizers, Microwave
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 tb Flour
1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
21 oz Canned chicken giblet gravy
4 oz Sliced mushrooms, drained
5 sl Raw bacon
1 1/2 lb Chicken livers
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1. Place 5 slices of bacon in a 10-inch, heat-resistant, non- metallic
skillet. Cover with a paper towel and heat in Microwave Oven 5
minutes or until bacon is crisp.
2. Remove bacon and set aside.
3. In a plastic bag combine flour, salt and pepper. Coat chicken
livers with
seasoned flour and place in hot bacon fat. Add minced onion.
4. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 4 minutes. Turn chicken livers
over and
heat an additional 4 minutes or until chicken livers are browned.
5. Add the canned chicken giblet gravy and heat, covered, in Microwave
Oven 6
minutes.
6. Add mushrooms, stir and heat an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes in
Microwave
Oven.
Tip: If chicken livers begin to pop, pierce them with the tines of a
fork before continuing to cook. The popping is just the steam
escaping through the
thin membrane surrounding the livers.
