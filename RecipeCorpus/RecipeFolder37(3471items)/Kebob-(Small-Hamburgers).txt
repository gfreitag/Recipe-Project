KEBOB (Small Hamburgers)

A classic Middle Eastern dish.  There is hardly a restaurant in Israel
which
does not feature kebob at the head of its menu.

Mix meat with cumin, salt, pepper, and water.  Knead well for 5
minutes. Add chopped onion and chopped parsley.  Form a big ball and
keep in refrigerator for 12 hours.

Before cooking, wet your fingers and form 3 in. x 1 in. stick-like
hamburgers. Grill for 5-8 minutes.  Turn from side to side until
brown. Serve with fresh vegetable salad.
