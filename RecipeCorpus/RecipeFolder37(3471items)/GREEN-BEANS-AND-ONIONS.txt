Title: GREEN BEANS AND ONIONS
Categories: Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1    Clove garlic, chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
12 sm Pearl Onions, peeled
1 lb Green beans
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Olive oil
1.  Put onions in a small amount of boiling salted water in a
saucepan. Cover and cook 15 minutes, or until onions are tender. When
finished, drain. 2. Meanwhile, wash fresh green beans, break off
ends, and cut lengthwise into fine strips. Bring a small amount of
water to boiling in saucepan, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and the prepared
beans. Cover and cook 10 to 15 minutes, or until the beans are
tender. Drain 3. Heat oil and garlic in a skillet until garlic is
slightly browned. Add green beans and onions, season with salt and
pepper, and cook 5 minutes util thoroughly heated. Stirring
occasionally. 4. For vairiations, consider a small can of Italian,
peeled Tomatoes or Tomatoes with/Jalepenos for a stightly Mexican
flavor. While this recipe calls for fresh  green beans, I have had
good results with a 10 oz package of frozen, french cut, green beans.
(I think the canned variety would not be suitable for this recipe,
but who knows until you've tried it!)
