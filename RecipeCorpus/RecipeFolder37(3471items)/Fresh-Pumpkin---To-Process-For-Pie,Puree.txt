Title: Fresh Pumpkin - To Process For Pie/Puree
Categories: Holiday, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
See below
1.  Wash pumpkin thoroughly [I use 'neck' pumpkins] - Cut out stem.

2.  Place on cookie sheet [type with sides] and bake in oven at 325
degrees for about 40 minutes or until fork inserts easily.

3.  Cool - cut in half - scoop out seeds - scoop out pumpkin - and
process in food processor til pureed.

4.  IF YOU ARE FREEZING pumpkin - scoop out pumpkin - THEN FREEZE -
and puree after thawed for best results.  You may freeze pureed
pumpkin but pies tend to be a bit 'watery'.
