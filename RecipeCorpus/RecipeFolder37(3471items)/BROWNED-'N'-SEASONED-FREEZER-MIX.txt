Categories: Meats
Yield: 14 servings
2 ts Salt
3/4 ts Pepper
4 lb Ground beef
1 1/2    Onion;chopped,large
3    Cloves garlic;minced
Cook and stir meat, onions and garlic in Dutch oven until meat is
brown. Drain off fat. Stir in seasonings. Spread meat mixture in 2
ungreased baking pans, 13x9x2 inches. Freeze 1 hour. (This partial
freezing prevents the meat from freezing together solidly.) Crumble
meat mixture into small pieces; place in heavy plastic bag or freezer
container. Seal securely and label; freeze no longer than 3 months.
Use freezer mix in the recipes that call for it. NOTE: You can use
this mix in any recipe for drained, seasoned browned ground beef.
Each 3 1/2 cups lightly packed frozen mix is the equivalent of 1
pound ground beef, 1/3 cup chopped onion, 1 small clove garlic, 1/2
teaspoon salt and dash of pepper. (If mixture is not frozen, allow 3
cups.)
