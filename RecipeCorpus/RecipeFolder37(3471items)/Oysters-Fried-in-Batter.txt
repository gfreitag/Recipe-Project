Title: Oysters Fried in Batter
Categories: Fish/seafoo, White house
Yield: 1 batch
Salt and pepper to taste
Nutmeg
Oil for frying
1/2 pt Oysters
2    Eggs
1/2 pt Milk
1 1/4 c  Flour
Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and lay them on a
cloth to drain thoroughly.  Break the eggs into a basin, mix the
flour with them, add the milk gradually, with nutmeg if desired and
seasoning, and put the oysters in a batter.   Heat the oil in a deep
frying pan;  put in the oysters one at a time;  when done, take them
up with a sharp pointed skewer and dish them on a napkin.

Fried oysters are frequently used for garnishing fish, and if so used
a few bread crumbs should be added to the flour.
