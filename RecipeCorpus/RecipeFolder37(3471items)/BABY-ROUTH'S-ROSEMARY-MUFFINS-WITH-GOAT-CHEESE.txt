Title: BABY ROUTH'S ROSEMARY MUFFINS WITH GOAT CHEESE
Categories: Breads, Herbs/spice
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
8 tb Goat cheese
3/4 c  Milk
3/4 c  Golden raisins
1 tb Chopped fresh rosemary
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Rosemary, golden rasins, and a creamy goat cheese center make these
muffins taste so special.  Carla Wood, sous chef and butcher at Baby
Routh in Dallas serves them with wild game, lamb, or pork dishes or
with a festive luncheon salad.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Simmer milk, raisins, and rosemary in a small
saucepan for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter and stir until
melted. Let cool.

Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Beat egg into cooked milk
mixture. Add to dry ingredients and mix lightly just until dry
ingredients are moistened.  Spoon 1/3 of the batter into 12 greased
muffin cups.  Place 2 teaspoons of goat cheee in center of batter in
each cup.  Cover cheese with remaining batter, dividing among each of
the muffins.  Bake approximately 20 minutes in a preheated 350 degree
F oven, or until brown and springy in the center.

Serve muffins hot or cool.  If desired, a 3/4-inch cube of cream
cheese may be substituted for goat cheese.  Without cheese, muffins
are still delicious!
