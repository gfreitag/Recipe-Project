Title: INDIA SPICED EGGPLANT
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1    Tomato (large)
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Fresh cilantro, chopped
2 lb Eggplant
2 tb Salad oil
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
1 tb Fresh ginger, minced
1    Medium red onion
1 ts Turmeric
1/2    Green pepper
2 ts Ground coriander
Place whole eggplant in a shallow pan and bake in a 400Ã¸F. oven until
very soft, about 50 minutes.  Alternatively, prick with a fork, set
on paper toweling, and microwave, uncovered, at 100% for 18-20
minutes.  Cool slightly.  Cut eggplant open and scoop out the pulp in
large chunks, discarding larger seed pockets, stem and skin.
Coarsely chop. (Some people prefer to leave the skin on and chop the
eggplant into 1" cubes.) Set in a colander to drain.
Coarsely slice red onion.  Mince ginger. Heat oil in a wide frying pan
over medium heat.  Add cumin seeds, ginger, and onion and cook,
stirring occasionally, until onion is soft.
Coarsely chop tomato and seeded green pepper. Add to onion mixture
along with turmeric, coriander, ground cumin, paprika, salt, and
pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Add water and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10
minutes.  Stir in chopped eggplant and cook for 5 minutes just to heat
through and blend flavors.  Just before serving, stir in coarsely
chopped cilantro.
