Categories: Thai, Chinese
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Water
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Sesame oil
1 c  Bean sprouts
1/4 ts Ground white pepper
1 lb Firm tofu
3    Serrano chilies
4    Green onions
1/4 c  Oyster sauce
2 tb Fish sauce
Press tofu between paper towels, for about 30 minutes, to remove
excess water.  Cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Soak bean sprouts in cold
water for about 15 minutes, to freshen. Remove the stems from chiles,
and slice lengthwise into thin strips.  Add them to tofu. Diagonally
slice the green onions into pieces about 1 inch long and 1/4 inch
thick. Set aside. Mix the oyster sauce, fish sauce, and water.  Set
aside. Heat a wok, add both kinds of oil, and swirl them over the
surface of the pan. Stif-fry the garlic until it is light golden.
Add the tofu, chiles, and bean sprouts. Stir-fry over moderate heat
until the bean sprounts are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Add the
oyster sauce mixture and the green onions. Stif over high heat until
all the ingredients are heated through and the mixture is boiling.
Put the mixture in a serving bowl and sprinkle with pepper. Serve
immediately or keep it warm while you prepare other dishes.  Serve
with Lime Sauce and rice.
