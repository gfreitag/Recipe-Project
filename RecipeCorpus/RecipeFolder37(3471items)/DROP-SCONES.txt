Scotland's version of the scone, sometimes known as "Scot's Pancake".
Looks more like a crumpet, though the texture resembles a pancake.

Preheat a griddle or heavy skillet over high heat; grease lightly.
Sift flour, baking soda and salt into a large bowl.  Stir in sugar.
Add buttermilk, egg, and melted butter and mix well with a wooden
spoon.  Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto griddle or skillet,
spacing scones well apart.  Cook a few minutes or until tops are
bubbling and undersides are golden brown; flip over with a wide
spatula and cook until brown on other side.  As scones are cooked,
wrap them in a cloth towl or napkin to keep them moist and warm while
you cook remaining scones.  Serve warm with butter.  Makes 12 to 15
scones.

VARIATIONS:  Fruit Drop Scones - Add 1/2 cup raisins (plumped) to dry
ingredients.
