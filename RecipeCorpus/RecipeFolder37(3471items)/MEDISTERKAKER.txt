Yield: 20 cakes
1/2 ts Ground nutmegs
1/4 ts Ginger
5 dl Milk
1 kg Ground pork
3 ts Salt
5 tb Potato flour
3/4 ts Pepper
Ground pork: Use a blend of minced fat and lean pork. Should contain
about 20% fat.
Milk: Should be high in fat.
Potato flour: I guess corn starch will do just as well.
Mix the meat with salt until sticky. Add flour and spices. Add milk, a
little a time. Be sure the meat gets sticky between each time you add
milk. The resulting blend should not be too firm. Make balls the size
of a small child's fist. Fry in a hot frying pan, when the are
chestnut brown put them in simmering water or broth. Takes about ten
minutes to get finished.
