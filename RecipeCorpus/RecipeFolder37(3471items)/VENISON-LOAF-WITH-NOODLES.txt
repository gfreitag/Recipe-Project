mushy. Combine mixture with ground venison.  Shape into mold and
turn out onto baking pan. (You can do this with any meatloaf:
very pretty and easy to slice).

Combine the catsup, brown sugar and prepared mustard. Brush
mixture onto loaf.  Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven for 40
minutes, brushing with catsup mixture once more during baking.

Remove loaf from oven and arrange Jack cheese slices over
loaf. Bake about 5 minutes longer until cheese melts. Slide
onto serving plate. Fill center with Poppy Seed Noodles.
POPPY SEED NOODLES: Cook the noodles according to directions on
the package, or until tender. Drain well. Toss with butter,
half-and-half and Jack cheese. Sprinkle on the poppy seeds and
toss well to mix.
