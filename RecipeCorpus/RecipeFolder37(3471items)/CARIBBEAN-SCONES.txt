Created by West Indians living in England, these are scrumptious.

Preheat oven to 375F (190C).  Grease a baking sheet; set aside.  Sift
flour, baking powder and salt into a medium-size bowl; stir in sugar.
In a large bowl, thoroughly mix potatoes and 1 1/2 tablespoons melted
butter with a fork.  Add dry ingredients and mix to form a soft
dough.  Turn out onto floured surface.  Roll out with a floured
rolling pin or pat dough with your hands to make a round about
1/2-inch thick.  Cut into rounds with a 2-inch fluted or plain cookie
cutter.  Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet; brush tops
with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter. Bake about 20 minutes
or until light brown.  Split and serve warm with butterand honey.
Makes about 10 scones.
