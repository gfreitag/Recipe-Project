Title: CARAMEL NUT FROSTING
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 16 servings
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)
1 1/2 c  Chopped pecans
3 c  Sugar
2 tb Light cane syrup (or corn
-syrup
1 c  Heavy cream
Place 1-1/2 cups of the sugar into a heavy saucepan, taking care that
no crystals cling to the sides of the pan. Add syrup.  Add cream by
pouring down the sides of the pan to wash away any crystals that may
have collected there. Place sauce pan over medium heat and stir as
sugar melts. When mixture boils, place remaining sugar in a heavy
saute pan (preferably cast iron) over medium heat and stir until sugar
melts and turns golden brown.  DO NOT LET SUGAR BURN OR IT WILL TASTE
BITTER.  Add browned sugar to the mixture in the saucepan.  Stir and
cook until mixture reaches the soft ball stage (240 deg).  Add vanilla
and pour mixture over chunked butter in a mixing bowl. Let cool for
about 5 minutes, then beat vigourously until frosting reaches
spreading consistency. Add chopped pecans. Frost top of each layer,
stacking one upon the other, then frost side of cake. Freezes well
[but *I'll* never know]. ** The secret of success with this frosting
is in the sugar. After the ingredients have reached the proper
temperature, no sugar crystals can be introduced into the liquid, else
the frosting will be grainy instead of smooth and creamy.
