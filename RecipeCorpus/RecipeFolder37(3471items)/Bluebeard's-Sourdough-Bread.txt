Title: Bluebeard's Sourdough Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Sourdough starter
3 c  Flour
1    Cake yeast
3/4 c  Water
2 ts Salt
Mix yeast, water, salt, sourdough starter in a mixing bowl.  Add
flour, 1 cup
at-a-time and turn out onto a floured board.  Knead for about 10
minutes and
let
rise in a bowl covered by plastic wrap for 2 to 3 hours - until
tripled in volume.
Turn out onto a floured board and knead down again for about 2 to 5
minutes and form into a ball.  Place on a baking sheet that you have
sprinkled with corn
meal, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise for about an hour -
until doubled
in volume.

Make several slashes about 1/4 inch deep in the dough.  I try to
create some
interesting geometric patterns, but you can do what you like.
Preheat your oven
to 450 degrees, brush or spray the loaf with water, spritz the inside
of your
oven to create steam and insert your loaf.

Bake for 15 minutes @ 450 degrees then turn the oven down to 350 and
bake for
another 25 minutes.  To create steam in order to form a nice crust, I
use a small spray bottle filled with water and spray the inside of
the oven about every two minutes for the first 6 to 8 minutes.  This
is not necessary, but I
like the crust that is formed using this process much better than if
I just allow the loaf to bake normally.

Another handy tip I've run across is the use of a thermometer to see
if the
bread is done.  At the end of the given baking time, I insert the
thermometer
into the thickest part of the loaf and if it registers 190 degrees or
better,
the loaf is done otherwise, I return it to the oven and bake it until
the internal temperature is at least 190 degrees.
