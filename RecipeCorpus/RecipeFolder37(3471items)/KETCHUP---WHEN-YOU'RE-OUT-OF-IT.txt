Title: KETCHUP - WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF IT
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 servings
ds Cinnamon
1 tb Vinegar
8 oz Tomato sauce
1/4 c  Sugar
Pour the tomato sauce into a small sauce pan, and then just boil away
some of the water until it begins to thicken. Now add the other
ingredients and simmer for 3 or 4 minutes.

If you need the catsup for cooked mixtures, just combine the
ingredients above and add to your recipe in place of catsup. Only
need to cook it if you plan to use it as a garnish, on hot dogs, etc.
