through, about 3 min. Drain shrimp in a colander and cool 5 min.

Make Marinade: In a bowl whisk together vinegar, lemon and lime
juices, cloves, and salt and pepper to taste and whisk in oil in a
stream until marinade is emulsified. Stir in garlic.

In a large glass bowl combine warm shrimp and marinade and cool shrimp
completely. Marinate shrimp, covered and chilled, stirring
occasionally, 8 hours or overnight.

Serve shrimp with lemon and lime wedges.
