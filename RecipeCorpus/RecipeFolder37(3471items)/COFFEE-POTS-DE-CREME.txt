Title: COFFEE POTS DE CREME
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Castor sugar
2 ts Tia Maria or Kahlua
600 ml Thickened cream (2 cartons)
1/2 c  Roasted coffee beans
6    Egg yolks
MMMMM--------------------------PRALINE-------------------------------
1 tb Water
2 tb Slivered almonds
1/4 c  Sugar
Pour cream into saucepan, bring to the boil, add coffee beans, reduce
heat. Simmer gently 3 minutes, remove from heat, stand for 30
minutes, strain.

Whisk egg yolks, sugar and Tia Maria in a bowl,  whisk in
coffee-flavoured cream.   Pour mixture into individual ovenproof
dishes (1/3 cup capacity).
Place dishes into a lamington pan**  Pour enough hot water into the
pan to come half way up the side of the dishes. Cover with foil or
lids, bake in slow oven for about 20 minutes or until mixture is just
set. Cool, refrigerate before serving.

PRALINE: Place almonds into a saucepan, stir constantly over heat
until lightly browned, spread evenly onto a lightly greased oven
tray. Combine sugar and water in same pan, stir constantly over heat
without boiling until sugar is dissolved. Boil rapidly without
stirring until mixture turns golden brown. Remove from heat, allow
bubbles to subside, pour over almonds, chop roughly when set.

Decorate pots de creme with extra whipped cream and praline.

(**  A lamington dish is a wide shallow metal dish for baking)
