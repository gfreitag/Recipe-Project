Title: CHICKEN BRAISED WITH MARSALA
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Tomato paste
1/2 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
3 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Olive oil
1    Fryer chicken, 3- 3 1/2 lbs.
- cut up
1 tb Finely minced onion
1/2 c  Marsala wine
This is one of those dishes that can be endlessly adapted. Substitute
different wines or even vinegars for the Marsala to wind up with very
different dishes.
HEAT THE OIL in an oven-proof 12-inch skillet over high heat. Add the
chicken and brown well. Remove and reserve on a plate. Preheat oven to
425F. Discard the cooking fat in the skillet, add onions, Marsala,
tomato paste, chicken stock, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil.
Replace the chicken thighs and transfer the skillet, uncovered, to
the oven. Cook for 20 minutes, add the breasts and continue to cook
another 12 to 15 minutes. Remove skillet from oven and remove chicken
to a plate. Replace skillet on the stove top over high heat and
reduce the cooking liquid until it becomes shiny and somewhat
thickened. Remove from the heat and swirl in the butter. Arrange the
chicken on a serving platter and strain the sauce over it.
