Title: Lake Trout Swordfish with Rosemary Butter
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1 cl Garlic; minced
1 ts Dried rosemary; crumbled
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Butter
Fresh parsley sprigs
4    Lake trout steaks;
-3/4" to 1" thick
Salt and pepper
1 tb Butter
2    Shallots; minced or
1 sm Onion; chopped and
Season fish with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a heavy medium
skillet over medium heat. Add fish and cook until just opaque, about
8-10 min, turning once. Transfer fish to warm platter and hold in a
low 250 F oven.

Add shallots and rosemary to the pan and stir fry over medium heat
until shallots soften, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice. Increase
heat and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Add any juices
from the fish platter. Boil until the sauce is reduced and thickened,
5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and swirl in 2 tb butter. Season
sauce with salt and pepper. Spoon over fish. Garnish with parsley.

Variations: Other herbs can be used in place of rosemary; tarragon is
especially good. Omit the herbs and increase the garlic to 2-3
cloves. Sub dill for parsley. Add a drop of two of bottle hot sauce
or a pinch of cayenne to the herb butter with the lemon juice. Add
anchovies to the shallots and capers with the final butter swirl.
