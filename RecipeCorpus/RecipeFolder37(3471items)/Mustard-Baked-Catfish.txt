Title: Mustard Baked Catfish
Categories: Foodmagazin, Fish/seafoo, Main dish
Yield: 3 servings
1 cn Evaporated skim milk (12oz)
1 tb Parsley; chopped
1 tb Scallions; chopped
2    Catfish fillets (about 1lb)
1 pk Louisiana Fish Fry
4 tb Dijon mustard
Mix mustard and evaporated skim milk in large bowl. Cut caffish into
bUe size chunks. (You can buy the caffish pieces if you like, they
are usually cheaper than fillets. But they are uneven in size and by
the time you get the larger pieces cooked, the smaller ones are hard
as bricks.)

Place caffish in mustard-milk mixture and let set for 15 minutes.

Mix parsley, scallions and Fish Fry in a large plastic bowl with lid.
Place caffish in a colander and drain. Then place in bowl with Fish
Fry mixture. Place lid on bowl and shake, coating all the fish.

Knock off excessive Fish Fry from each piece and place fish on a
cookie sheet lightly coated with vegetable spray. Bake on lower rack
in a preheated 375 degree oven for 15 minutes. Move tray to top rack
and finish under the broiler for an additional 10 minutes, or until
fish begins to brown on comers.

Serve with a ketchup and horseradish cocktail sauce.
