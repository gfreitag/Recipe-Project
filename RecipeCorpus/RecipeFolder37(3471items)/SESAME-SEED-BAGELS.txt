1 tb Vegetable oil
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (approx)
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Warm water
1 tb Dry yeast
2    Eggs
MMMMM----------------------POACHING LIQUID---------------------------
2 tb Sugar
16 c  Water
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1    Egg, beaten
1/2 c  Sesame or poppy seeds
1. In a large bowl, dissolve 1 tsp sugar in water.  Sprinkle yeast
over top.  Let stand for 10 minutes til frothy.  Whisk in eggs with
oil.  Beat in 2 cups of the flour, sugar and salt until smooth.
Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft but
not sticky dough.

2. Turn onto a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes til smooth
and elastic and dough springs back when poked with finger.  Place in
a greased bowl, turning to grease all over.  Cover with plastic wrap
and tea towel. Let rise in warm place for 1 -1 1/2 hours or til
doubled in bulk.

3. Punch down; knead several times.  Divide into 12 equal pieces.
Roll each into a 12 inch rope, covering pieces with towel while
working.

4.  Bring ends of dough together, overlapping by about 1 inch and
stretching overlap around other end to meet underneath.  Pinch firmly
to seal.  NOTE: Unless ends are pinched together very firmly, they
will come apart in the water.

5.  Poaching liquid.  In a wide saucepan, bring water to a boil; add
sugar. Slip bagels into water, 3-4 at a time; cook over medium heat
for 1 minute. Using slotted spoon or spatula, remove bagels to well
greased or parchment lined baking sheets.

6.  Glaze:  Place sesame seeds in a dish.  Brush bagels with egg.  Dip
bagels in seeds.  Return to baking sheet.  Bake at 400 F for 20-25
minutes or til tops are golden and bottoms sound hollow when tapped.
Transfer to a rack to cool.

Variation:

Whole wheat Cinnamon Raisin Bagels: Substitute 1 cup whole wheat
flour for all purpose.  Increase 2 Tb sugar to 1/4 cup. Stir in 2 ts
cinnamon along with eggs. After punching down dough, thoroughly knead
in 1 cup raisins. Omit sesame seeds.
