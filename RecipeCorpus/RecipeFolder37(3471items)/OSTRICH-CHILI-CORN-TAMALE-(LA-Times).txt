Yes, ostrich tamales. The recipe is from Randall Warder of the
Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas. At the restaurant Warder serves
this with pan-roasted ostrich fillets and a smoked shrimp enchilada
with a Thai sauce.

Soak chiles in bowl of hot water to cover until soft. Place chiles
and 2 tablespoons soaking liquid from chiles in blender or food
processor. Puree 1 minute. (If using ground chiles, simply mix with 2
tablespoons water.) Add cumin, coriander, oregano and cinnamon and
continue pureeing until smooth.

Heat oil in saucepan until very hot. Add chile puree and fry 1
minute. Add onion, garlic, ostrich and torn tortilla. Stir well to
combine. Add beer and stock, bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 2
hours.

Remove stew from heat and season to taste with salt and lime juice.
Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons corn puree on each corn husk "boat." Top
with stew and serve.
