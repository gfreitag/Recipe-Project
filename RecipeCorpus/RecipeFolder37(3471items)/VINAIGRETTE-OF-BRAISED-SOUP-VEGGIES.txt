* Note: Honest, the recipe was like this when I formatted it!  I
think it's supposed to be "PARSNIP roots".  (K.M.)

QUARTER CARROT LENGTHWISE, trim and discard top 2 inches of celery and
quarter remaining head. Remove green part of leeks. Slice turnip into
3/8-inch slabs. Place vegetables, garlic and coriander in a saucepan
large enough to handle them comfortably and add water and salt.
Cover, place over high heat. Cook until vegetables are soft and
remove each from the water as they are done. Place vegetables to
drain on towels and place in the refrigerator to chill. Add vinegar
to the liquid in the saucepan and boil the liquid until reduced by
2/3. Remove from the heat and pour the liquid into a mixing bowl.
When the liquid is cool, add the dill and vigorously beat in the oil.
Arrange the vegetables on a platter, pour the sauce over them and
serve.
