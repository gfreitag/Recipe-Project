1 cn Sweetened condensed milk
Remove label from can.  Place UNOPENED can in the bottom of a VERY
DEEP pot, such as a deep dutch oven. Cover with water so that the
water is 3 to 4-inches above the can. Bring the water to a boil and
boil steadily for four (4) hours.

YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE CAN IS ALWAYS TOTALLY COVERED WITH WATER.
NEVER LET THE WATER LEVEL GET DOWN TO THE TOP OF THE CAN, BECAUSE
THIS COULD CAUSE THE CAN TO EXPLODE.

Don't worry, I've been doing this for years and years. At Easter time
I boil 2 to 3 cans at once. After the four (4) hours is up, remove
the can with tongs and place on a wire rack to cool. Be assured, the
can will not explode.  Refrigerate.

When can is cold, open and you will have soft caramel; even the color
is caramel.  The only bad thing about boiling this one can is that
you will be sorry you didn't boil two or three.
