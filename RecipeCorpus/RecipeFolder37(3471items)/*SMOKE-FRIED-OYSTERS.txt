Title: *SMOKE FRIED OYSTERS
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Dijon mustard
Vegetable oil
1    Pan alder smoking chips
Tarter sauce or bottled
Honey mustard dressing
20 oz Shucked medium oysters
2/3 c  All-purpose flour
2/3 c  Saltine cracker crumbs
1 ts Black pepper
2    Eggs
Rinse oysters and drop into boiling water.  Bring to a boil again and
boil for 3 minutes.  Rinse again in cold water and smoke for 45
minutes.

While oysters are smoking whisk egg with mustard in a small bowl.
Combine cracker crumbs, pepper and flour in a pie plate.

When the oysters have finished smoking roll them in the flour/cracker
mixture and set on a plate.  Next dip the oysters in the egg/mustard
mixture and roll in the flour/cracker mixture again and return to the
plate.

Pour a film of oil into a 12 inch skillet and heat over medium-high
heat until a cube of bread is golden in 20 seconds. Add oysters to
pan (it's OK to crowd oysters, but don't overlap) and cook until
golden on bottom, about 2 minutes.  Turn and brown other side, about
2 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges and bottled honey mustard dressing
or tarter sauce.

Note: Very good.
