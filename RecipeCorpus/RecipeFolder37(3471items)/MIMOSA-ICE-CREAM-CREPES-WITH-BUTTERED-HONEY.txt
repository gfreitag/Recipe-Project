Title: MIMOSA ICE CREAM CREPES WITH BUTTERED HONEY
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Sugar (less 1 tablespoon)
2    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Light flower honey
1/4 c  Sweet butter
6    Crepes
Mimosa blossoms
1/2 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
TO CRISP CREPES:  Heat the oven to 375 F and put as many crepes as
will fit in a single layer on a rack - a cooling rack will do. They
must be spaced apart for air to circulate around them. Set the rack
over a cookie sheet, making sure air can circulate under the crepes,
and put them in the oven. Start  checking them after about 2 minutes.
When they are crisp all around their edges but you can still fold
them in the center, take them out and let them cool, folded in half,
on another rack. Repeat until you have one for each serving, then put
them on plates and fill.

FOR ICE CREAM: Strip the mimosa blossoms from their stems and leaves.
You will need 1 cup of blossoms. Put them in a non-corroding saucepan
with the milk, cream, and sugar, and heat to 200 F, or just under
boiling. Let steep for about 30 minutes, keeping the temperature at
190 F to 200 F. Whisk the egg yolks slightly in a small bowl and pour
in some of the hot milk mixture, stirring constantly, until the
custard coats a spoon. Strain into a bowl, pressing flowers to
extract the flavor. Chill thoroughly. Freeze according to the
instructions with your ice cream maker.

Serve in crisped crepes.  Sprinkle a few mimosa blossoms on the ice
cream and drizzle with buttered honey - honey warmed with sweet
butter - over and around the crepes.
