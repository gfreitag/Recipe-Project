Title: Morel Cream Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 1/3 cups
Salt and pepper
1 c  Heavy cream
1/2 ts Thyme, chopped
1 ts Lemon juice
1 oz Dried morels
1 c  Boiling water
1 tb Butter
1 lg Shallot, minced
Cover the morels with the boiling water and let soften for 30 min.
Rub the morels in the liquid to remove grit. Transfer them to a bowl;
cut any large ones in half. Reserve the liquid.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the shallot
and cook until translucent, about 1 min. Stir in the morels and
season with salt and pepper. Pour in the mushroom liquid, stopping
when you reach the grit. Boil over high heat to reduce by half, about
6 min. Add the cream and thyme, then simmer over moderately high heat
until reduced by 1/3, about 5 min. Season with salt and pepper and
the lemon juice.

Serve on top of buttered toast, over mashed potatoes or with
fettucine, roast chicken, veal, or panfried trout.
