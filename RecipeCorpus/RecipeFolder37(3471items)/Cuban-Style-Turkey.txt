Title: Cuban-Style Turkey
Categories: Holiday, Poultry
Yield: 1 servings

I lived in Miami for several years, and got a recipe there for a
Cuban-style turkey that turned out to be unbelievably delicious.

Slip some garlic cloves under the skin in numerous places.  Squeeze
fresh oranges (bitter if you can get them) all over the bird, and
place some of the orange halves in the cavity.  Then drape about 8
slices of bacon all over the turkey.  Baste frequently with the bacon
drippings as they melt.  I think I tented the turkey with aluminum
foil until the last hour or so of cooking; can't remember.  Anyway,
it was quite good.  Bon appetit.
