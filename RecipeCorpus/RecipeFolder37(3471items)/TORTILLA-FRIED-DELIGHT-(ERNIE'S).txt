Title: TORTILLA FRIED DELIGHT (ERNIE'S)
Categories: Appetizers, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings   Tortillas are very versatile and can be used instead of puff pastry
to make appetizers, sandwiches, snacks or desserts. The filling can
be as varied as your imagination using any thing from leftovers to
special made fillings.
Simply take a flour tortilla and mix up a paste of 1 teaspoon corn
flour and 1/2 teaspoon water and spread it around the edge of the
tortilla. Place the filling in the middle and seal the edges by
pressing them together where you spread the corn flour mixture.
Place oil in a skillet and heat it until it is hot. Fry tortilla on
both sides until golden brown. Place on a plate with a paper towel
and blot off any excess oil.
Enjoy!
