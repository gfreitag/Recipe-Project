Title: Spinach Fettuccine Alfredo w/Champagne-Poached Salmon
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Pasta/rice
Yield: 2 servings
10 oz Container Alfredo sauce
1 c  Frozen petite peas, thawed
Salt and pepper
9 oz Spinach fettuccine
1 c  Champagne
1 lb Salmon fillet
1. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 3-4 min. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, pour the champagne into a microwave-safe dish. Cover
with plastic wrap and microwave on HIGH for 1 min. Uncover the dish
and lay the salmon fillet, skin side down, in the dish. Cover again
and microwave on HIGH for 6-7 min, until the salmon is just opaque
throughout.

3. While the salmon is poaching, combine the Alfredo sauce and the
peas in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat to warm through.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. Remove the salmon form its poaching liquid; reserve the liquid.
Peel the skin from the salmon and discard. Break the fish into
bite-size pieces, discarding any small bones.

5. Strain  1/4 cup salmon liquid into the Alfredo sauce mixture. Add
pasta and half the fish to the sauce and toss to coat and heat
through. Divided the pasta between 2 plates. Top with remaining
salmon.
