Title: Basic Panfried Lake Trout Fillets -1
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Seasoned dry bread crumbs **
Vegetable oil ***
Lemon wedges
1 1/2 lb Lake trout fillet; *
1/3 c  Flour; all-purpose
1    Egg; beaten with
2 tb Water
* The individual portions to be pan fried should be 1/4" to 1/2"
thick. Slice a skinless fillet from head to tail horizontally to make
thinner fillets, then cut vertically into individual portions.

** The bread crumbs can be seasoned with your choice of salt, black or
white pepper, cayenne/chili powder/paprika/cajun spice mix, garlic
powder and a variety of green herbs: dried parsley, tarragon,
marjoram, basil, thyme, chevril, dill, etc.

*** Don't use pure butter as it will burn and blacken. A mixture of
butter and veg. oil gives a nice flavor or use margarine or bacon fat.

Lightly dredge each fillet portion in flour.  Beat egg and water; dip
floured fillets in the egg mixture.  Dredge in and coat with the crumb
mixture, pressing crumbs into fish.  Let stand on a rack for 10 min.
If necessary, repeat the egg and crumb treatment for a thicker,
firmer breading layer. Fry fillets in hot oil over medium heat until
browned. Drain on absorbent paper. Keep warm, uncovered, on racks in
a low oven [250 F] until all the fish is fried and ready for serving.

Serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing juice at the table
or a sauce.

The same technique works for steaks just as well. Use steaks 3/4"
to 1" thick and increase cooking time accordingly.
