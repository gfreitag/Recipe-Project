Mandarin is actually the name of a family of citrus fruits that are
small to medium, bright orange, easy to peel, and aromatic.
Clementines are a variety of mandarin; they are small, shiny,
smooth-skinned, and seedless with juicy flesh that is sweet yet tart.
They often have bright green leaves attached to the stem. The
tangerine is also a member of the mandarin family. Its proper
botanical name is "Dancy"; on theory is that an entrepreneur attached
the exotic-sounding name "tangerine: (derived from Tangier, the city
from which mandarins were first exported) to this type of mandarin
for marketing purposes, maybe as far back as 1842. Tangerines are
small, shiny fruits that are seedy and moderately sweet with skin
that is very easy to peel (especially when the tangerine is kept
beyond its peak and becomes puffy).
