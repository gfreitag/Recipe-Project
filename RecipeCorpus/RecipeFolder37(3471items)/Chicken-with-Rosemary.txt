Title: Chicken with Rosemary
Categories: Herbs/spice, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Chicken stock
3/4 c  Whipping cream
Salt & white pepper to taste
Rosemary sprigs; for garnish
3 lb Roasting chicken
5    Fresh rosemary sprigs
1 tb Butter; melted
1 tb Oil
1/2 c  White wine
Preheat oven to 400 F.

Put 2 whole rosemary sprigs into cavity of chicken.  Truss (skewer or
tie with string) chicken to secure wings and legs.  Brush all over
with half the butter and oil.  Reserve remainder for basting.
Separate rosemary leaves from remaining stems and place into tucks of
wings and legs, and on top of breast.  Place chicken, breast side up,
in a roasting pan.

Roast 30 minutes in preheated oven.  Tip pan to let juices flow out
from chicken cavity; baste.  Turn heat down to 350 F.; roast 35 to 40
minutes longer or until juices run clear.  Remove chicken from pan to
heatproof platter and keep warm.

Place pan on top of stove.  Spoon off surface fat.  Bring to a boil,
scraping up chicken bits from bottom of pan.  Deglaze by adding wine
and stock and continuing to scrape up bits.  Cook, over high heat,
until reduced by half.  Pick out any rosemary leaves.  Add whipping
cream and reduce over high heat until of desired consistency.  (The
longer it cooks, the more flavorful and thick).  Season with salt and
pepper.

Serve sauce with chicken, garnished with more rosemary sprigs.

A simple but satisfying dish.  Good with rice, glazed carrots and
steamed broccoli.
