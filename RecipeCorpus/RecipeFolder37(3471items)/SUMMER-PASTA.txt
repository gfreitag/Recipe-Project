Title: SUMMER PASTA
Categories: Appetizers, Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
Clove of garlic
3/4 ts Salt
Shredded parmesan
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 lg Dead-ripe tomatoe
1    Sprig of basil
Place a pan containing 1/4 cup best olive oil per diner over medium
heat.  Coarsely chop about 2 small or 1 large, dead-ripe tomatoes per
diner. (I don't peel them, but you could, if you prefer.)  Mince a
sprig of basil for each diner, and one small clove of garlic for the
whole.  Place the tomatoes, basil, and garlic in a pyrex dish (I use a
2-quart measure) and add 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Stir gently until the
tomatoes begin to give up their juice.  Just before the olive oil is
hot enough to smoke, pour it over the tomato mixture and stir to
blend.
Serve on room temperature cooked pasta of your choice (my current
favorite is cappellini) with shredded parmesan on the side.
