Title: CHICKEN PACKETS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Crushed, seasoned crouton
-crumbs
2 pk Refrigerated crescent rolls
1/4 c  Melted margarine
2 c  Cooked, chopped chicken
3 oz Package cream cheese
-softened
1 tb Chopped chives
2 tb Milk
Mix chicken, cream cheese, chives, milk and salt in a medium bowl
(mixing with hands works best) to make filling, and store in a 1
quart freezer bag. Put crouton crumbs in another 1 quart bag, attach
it to bag of chicken filling, and freeze them.  Refrigerate crescent
rolls.

To prepare for serving, thaw chicken mixture.  Unroll crescent rolls.
Each tube will contain 4 rectanngles of dough with a diagonal
perforation. Press dough along each perforation so the rectangle
halves will not separate. Place about 1/4 cup of chicken mixture into
the center of each rectangle. Fold dough over the filling, and pinch
the edges to seal tightly. Dip each packet in melted margarine, and
coat with crouton crumbs. Place packets on a baking sheet.  Bake in a
preheated 350 oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Pakcets are
good either hot or cold. Makes 8 packets.
