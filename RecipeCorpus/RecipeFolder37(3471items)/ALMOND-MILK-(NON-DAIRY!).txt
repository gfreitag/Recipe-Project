Title: ALMOND MILK (NON-DAIRY!)
Categories: Beverages, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Almonds
1 tb Syrup, maple
Use raw almonds.
Place almonds in blender and grind to fine powder.  Add syrup and 1 c
water.  Blend 1-2 minutes until smooth.  With blender running on high,
slowly add remaining water.  Blend 2 minutes.
Place strainer over large bowl.  Line with cheesecloth (not 100%
neccessary, but recommended. Otherwise strain twice with very fine
strainer.)  Pour almond milk slowly into strainer and let filter
through. When all milk has passed through strainer, press remaining
milk out of accumulated almond fiber.  Each serving will be
approximately 1-1/4 cups.
Milk will keep in fridge 4-5 days.  Leftover fiber can be used as
moisturizing body scrub in the shower.
