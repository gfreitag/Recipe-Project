Categories: Low cal/fat, Cake/cookie, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM-------------------------MIXTURE #1------------------------------
1/4 ts Salt [optional]
1 tb Carob powder
1/3 c  Oat flour *
1/3 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 ts Baking soda
MMMMM-------------------------MIXTURE #2------------------------------
1/2 tb Vanilla
1/2 c  Brown rice syrup ***
3 tb Wonderslim prune puree **
1 tb Water
MMMMM--------------------------BLEND IN-------------------------------
1/3 c  Walnuts or raisins
1/2 c  Carob chips
Carob comes from an edible seed pod from the St. John's Bread tree
that tastes vaguely like chocolate but is lower in fat.

*To make oat flour grind oatmeal in a blender.

**Wonderslim is a brand name prune puree that is a non-fat substitute
for butter and egg yolks in baking. It contains water, dried plums
and soy lecithin. You can get a similar effect from applesauce.

***Brown rice syrup is a sweetener available in health food stores.

Preheat oven to 375. Spray the cookie sheet with a thin film of veg.
oil. Combine mixture #1 and mix with a fork and set aside. beat
mixture #2 at medium speed until blended. Mix #1 into #2 and blend
well. Fold in the carob chips and nuts/raisins. Spoon onto cookie
sheets and bake at 375 for 15 min.

This cookie may not taste as good as a traditional butter and sugar
loaded chocolate chip cookie until you get used to it but it's better
than no cookie at all for those with restricted diets. [Jim's
