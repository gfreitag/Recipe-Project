In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil with the garlic, onion,
and caraway seeds, over moderate heat. As soon as they sizzle, add the
brocolli and saute, stirring continuously, until it turns dark green,
about 1 minute.
Add the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer
until the broccoli is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
Dot the sauce with the ricotta and, as soon as it begins to melt,
spoon over cooked pasta. Garnish with parsley.

canned broth of your choice until it evaporates down to 1 cup.
Note 2: For an even lighter version, you can substitute hoop cheese
for the ricotta.
