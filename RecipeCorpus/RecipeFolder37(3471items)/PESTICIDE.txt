Homemade pesticide:  To keep snails and ants away use beer.

ground.

Bugs don't like dead bugs:  Gather together a collection of dead
bugs, place in a blender with water; strin the mix until
spraying consistency.

Tiny pests attacking your house plants:  Take a tip from your
dog and ring them with a flea collar; then cover the plants with
plastic bags.  Remove in two days and the plants will be bug
free.

From Heloise:  To keep bugs away, mix garlic, hot peppers and
water in the blender.  Pour into a spray bottle and apply to
plants.  You also can put hot sauce on a cotton ball in a house
plant pot to repel pests.
