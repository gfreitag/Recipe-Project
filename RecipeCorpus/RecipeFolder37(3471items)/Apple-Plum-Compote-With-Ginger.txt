A wonderful old fashioned wintery dish:

Preheat oven to 350 F. Combine all the ingredients and dot the top
with butter. Bake about 30-45 min until apples are tender.

Feel free to substitute other fruits, adjust the spices or change the
sweetness.

The same ingredients can be stewed in a saucepan on top of the stove
without the flour for a delicious stewed fruit dish.

Make an oatmeal crumb crust and turn this into a cobbler or crisp
style dessert.

Serve over ice cream, pound cake, pancakes or waffles or with buttered
toast points.

Makes a good side dish for pork, ham, wild birds and tongue with
perhaps a little chutney stirred in.

A variation of an old classic by Jim Weller.
