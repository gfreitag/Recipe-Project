Title: Ravioli with Lemon Cream Sauce
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Italian parsley, chopped
Fresh ground pepper
10 oz Fresh ravioli
Pref tomato
2 c  Heavy cream
1    Lemon
1. Cook the ravioli in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 7-9 min. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, pour the cream into a large frying pan. Bring the cream
to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer.

3. While the cream is simmering, grate the colored zest from the
lemon and add to the cream. Squeeze the juice from the lemon into the
cream and add the salt. Continue simmering until the sauce is reduced
to about 1 cup, about 8-10 min.

4. Add the drained ravioli and chopped parsley to the saucepan and
toss gently to coat with the lemon-cream sauce. Season generously
with freshly ground pepper.
