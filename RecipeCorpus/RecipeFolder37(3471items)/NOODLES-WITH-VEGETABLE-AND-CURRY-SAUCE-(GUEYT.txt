In a large pan of boiling water, blanch the noodles and set aside.
Blanch the beansprouts, long beans and broccoli stems, arrange on a
serving dish and set aside.

In a saucepan, gently heat the coconut milk, stirring in the red curry
paste until thoroughly blended.  Add the remaining ingredients,
stirring until mixed.  Turn into a serving bowl.

Either serve all three elements separately or place the noodles on the
serving dish with the vegetables, pour over the sauce and garnish
with the crispy potato.
