This recipe works well in the Hitachi 101.  Other machines should make
ingredient adjustments according to their manufacturers suggestions.

Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Warm water, pumpkin, and
yogurt in microwave for approx. 60 seconds.  Because the pumpkin is
very dense, additional heating may be necessary.

Depending on humidity, an additional teaspoon or so of flour may be
necessary. (check after 5 mins, if dough is too wet, add flour.  Then
check again after rest cycle, and kneading begins) If necessary add a
little more flour. This dough is slightly sticky compared to some
other breads.

Add all ingredients in order recommended by manufacturer.  For the
Hitachi add the pecans and raisins about 12 mins into the mixing
cycle. (If I wait until the beeper, they don't get mixed in too well).

Set on mix cycle, and light crust.

This recipe makes a dense, small loaf, with much the consistency of a
bagel, but very good.  It is a cross between pumpkin pie and raisin
bread.
