Title: Red Beans with Parsley and Pomegranate
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Pomegranate syrup
1/3 c  Red wine vinegar
1 1/2 c  Flat-leaf parsley leaves
Loosely packed
Coarsely chopped
Salt
2 c  Small red beans (abt 1 lb)
Picked over, rinsed
Soaked overnight in
6 c  Water
2 ts Coriander seeds
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
6    Garlic clove(s), minced
1. In a large saucepan, cover the beans with 8 cups cold water and
bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderately high
and cook until very tender, 1 1/2-2 hours. Drain and set aside.

Can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.

2. In a small dry skillet, toast the coriander seeds over moderately
high heat, stirring often, until darkened and fragrant, about 1 1/2
min. Transfer to a spice mill and grind to a powder.

3. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet. Add the garlic and stir-fry
over moderately high heat until just beginning to color. Stir in the
ground coriander and then the drained beans. Cook over moderate heat,
stirring gently, until warmed through.

4. Meanwhile, whisk the pomegranate syrup with the vinegar. Stir the
mixture into the beans and remove from the heat. Fold in the parsley
until evenly distributed and season the beans with salt. Serve warm
or at room temperature.
