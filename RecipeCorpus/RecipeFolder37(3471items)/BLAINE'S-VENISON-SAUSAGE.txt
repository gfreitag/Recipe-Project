Title: BLAINE'S VENISON SAUSAGE
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Sage
1/2 c  Honey
6 lb Ground venison
6 lb Ground pork (lean)
2 tb Salt
2 tb Pepper
When the venison, pork and hot water are well mixed, add spices and
honey to mixture and mix in well.

This is probably my favorite recipe eventhough this is the one which
has evolved the most in the past 5 years.  A couple of years ago my
father mistakenly calculated the spices in tablespoons instead of
teaspoons, and it
was better then the previous batch of sausage written above.  The next
year we
increased the amount of black pepper, and was it ever good.  So if
you like spices, and in sausage a little spice is good, then play
around with the mixture a little bit.  I will be adding a small
amount of a "cajun" pepper mix
to a small 20 lb. test batch of sausage this weekend.
