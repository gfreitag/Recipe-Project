1    Lemon, sliced
2    1.5-lb live lobsters, pegged
1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
1. In a deep, 3-quart, heat-resistant, non-metallic casserole
place water, salt and lemon.
2. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 3 minutes or until water boils.
3. Place live lobsters, head first, into boiling water: this will
render them immobile.
4. Heat, covered, in Microwave Oven 12 minutes.
5. Let stand, covered, 4 minutes to finish cooking.
6. Drain. With a sharp, heavy knife, split tail. If meat is still
translucent
in center, heat, covered, about 1 minute longer or until meat is
opaque. Continue to cut up the center towards the head. Remove the
stomach and the intestinal tract. The green liver and the red roe are
considered to be delicacies.
