In a heavy sauce pan, boil almond slivers, sugar and water over low to
medium heat until all the water is gone and the sugar crystallizes on
the peanuts.

Pour almond slivers out onto a well-greased baking sheet. Separate
clumps with a greased fork.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven
about 15 minutes.  Be careful not to burn.

Melt chocolate over low heat with constant stirring.  When candied
almonds have cooled, dip into melted chocolate.  Place on foil to set.

Her notes:

*  These nuts -- which are "quick and easy" for holiday entertaining
~- were
inspired by a presentation Shirley attended at a cooking schools
convention at the Ritz Carlton.  They are basically the same recipe
Paula Murphy uses for candied peanuts; she uses raw, Spanish peanuts
instead of almonds, and she doesn't coat them with chocolate.
