Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome
Yield: 6 servings
All-purpose flour
2 1/2 c  Dry red wine
2 1/2 c  Canned beef broth
1 1/2 tb Tomato paste
2    Bay leaves
Rosemary sprigs to garnish
4 tb Olive oil
1 lb Onion(s), sliced
5 lg Shallots, sliced (1 cup)
2 tb Rosemary, chopped or
2 ts Dried rosemary
6    Lamb shanks
3/4 to 1 pound each
Heat 2 tbs olive oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Add sliced onions and shallots and saute until brown, about 20 min.
Mix in 2 tb chopped rosemary. Remove from heat.

Sprinkle lamb shanks with salt and pepper; coat lamb with flour. Heat
remaining 2 tbs olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.
Working in batches, add lamb shanks to skillet and cook until brown
on both sides, about 10 min per batch. Using tongs, transfer lamb
shanks to plate. Add 1 cup dry red wine to same skillet and bring to
boil, scraping up any browned bits. Pour into Dutch oven with onion
mixture. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups red wine, canned beef broth, tomato
paste, and 2 bay leaves to Dutch oven. Bring to boil, stirring until
tomato paste dissolves. Add lamb shanks, turning to coat with liquid.

Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until lamb is
almost tender, turning lamb shanks occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.

Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.

Uncover Dutch oven and boil until liquid is reduced to sauce
consistency, stirring and turning lamb shanks occasionally, about 30
min. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve with Potato and Root Vegetable Mash (see recipe); top
vegetables with lamb shanks and sauce, sprinkle with additional
chopped rosemary and serve.
