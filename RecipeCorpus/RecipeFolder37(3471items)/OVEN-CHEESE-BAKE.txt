Title: OVEN CHEESE BAKE
Categories: Casseroles, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Dry mustard
2 c  Cheddar, sharp, shredded
5 c  Bread cubes
1 cn Onions, french fried
6    Eggs
3 c  Milk
1 ts Salt, garlic
2 tb Parsley
Preheat oven to 325.  Remove crusts from bread, and cut into cubes.
Beat eggs, milk, and seasonings with rotary beater. Stir in bread
cubes, cheese and 1/2 can onions. (To make shrimp bake, stir in 2
cups cleaned cooked shrimp.)  Pour into 11-1/2"x7-1/2"x1-1/2" greased
baking dish. Top with remaining onions. Bake covered for 45 minutes,
then uncover and bake another 15 minutes, until set. Serve
immediately.

Sylvia's comments: I used a can of french-fried onions instead of the
chopped onion, mixed 1/2 into the cheese mixture and used 1/2 to top
the casserole.  My cheese-crazy kids LOVED it. And I think you could
add almost anything to it; it's a basic strata recipe, but the first
one I've had come out well.
