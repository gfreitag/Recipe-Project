MEAT MIXTURE

Prepare pancakes.

Combine cornstarch, soy sauce and sherry in large bowl. Add raw beef,
raw pork, green onions, ginger and garlic; mix until thoroughly
combined.

Spread 1/2 cup meat mixture evenly over each pancake, leaving about
1/2 inch border on one side.  Starting with opposite side, roll up
pancake jelly roll fashion.  Place rolls, seam side down in single
layer on heatproof plate; place plate on steamer rack.  Set rack in
large pot or wok of boiling water.  Cover and steam 15 minutes.  (For
best results, steam all rolls at the same time)  Just before serving,
cut rolls diagonally into quarters.  Arrange on serving platter and
serve hot.
