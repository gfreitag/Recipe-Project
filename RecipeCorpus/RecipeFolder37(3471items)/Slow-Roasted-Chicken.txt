Title: Slow-Roasted Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper
Oil for V-rack
1    Roasting chicken
(about 3 lb) *
2 tb Butter, melted
* giblets removed and reserved for another use, chicken rinsed and
patted dry with paper towels.

1. Heat oven to 375 F. Brush chicken with butter and sprinkle
liberally with salt and pepper.

2. Place chicken, breast side up, on oiled V-rack, set in shallow
roasting pan. Roast 30 min, then reduce oven temperature to 200 F.
Roast 1 hour. Increase temperature to 400 F and roast until
instant-read thermometer inserted in thigh register 170 F to 175 F,
about 15 min longer. Transfer chicken to cutting board; let rest 20
min. Carve and serve.

Notes: Larger chickens will obviously require longer roasting time.
Add 5 min of cooking time at 375 F for every additional quarter pound
of weight over 3 1/2 pounds(a 4-lb bird, for example, would roast for
a total of 40 min at 375 F). If the bird is still not cooked after 15
min at 400 F, keep the bird in the oven until the thigh meat comes up
to temperature. Do not stuff or truss a slow-roasted chicken.
