Title: PEGG'S OVEN ROAST BEEF
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
Beef roast
Bring roast to room temp.  Preheat oven to 450.  Roast 1 hour, then
turn off oven and leave it there without opening the oven for about 5
hours.

You can turn oven on about 30 mins before serving to warm it up a
bit, but it turns out just as I prefer  - not over done and with some
of the good ends for those who prefer well done!

This is the way I cook almost any roast and it turns out delicious!!
