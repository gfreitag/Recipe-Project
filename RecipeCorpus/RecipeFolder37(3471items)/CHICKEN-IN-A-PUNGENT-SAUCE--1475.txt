Categories: Poultry

MMMMM-----------------------CHICKEN--1475----------------------------
Cook chicken with salted meat. When it is half cooked, put seeded
grapes in the pot. Throw in parsley and a pinch of mint. Crush
together pepper and saffron.
Put all the ingredients in the pot when the chicken is cooked and
serve immediately. Platina says:  "There is nothing more healthful
than this food, which Poggio frequently eats when I have been
invited. It is nourishing, easily cooked, agrees with the stomach,
heart, liver, kidneys and checks the bile."
