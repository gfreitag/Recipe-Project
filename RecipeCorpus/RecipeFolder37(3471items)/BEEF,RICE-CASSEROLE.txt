Title: BEEF/RICE CASSEROLE
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Garlic fresh
3/4 ts Rice
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 lb Ground Beef
1 c  Chopped onion
1 pk Chopped Broccoli 10 oz.
1 cn Broc/Cheese Soup
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the rice with the water in
standard manner. (I do not use salt or margarine in the preparation
of the rice.) While the rice is cooking chop the onions and garlic.
Saute slowly until onions are just tender.  Add the ground beef and
brown. Cook onions and ground beef about 7 minutes.  Drain off the
fat. Return to medium heat. Separately mix the broccoli cheese soup
and milk. Stir until creamy in texture. At this point test for taste.
I usually add table grind black pepper and salt (less that 1/2
teaspoon). When the ground beef is ready, add the rice and broccoli,
and soup mixture, tossing carefully.  Put the mixture in to a 9 x 9,
or 9 x 13 casserole dish.  Sometimes I top this with seasoned bread
crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Bake about 35 minutes.
