Use this in recipes calling for prepared fondant and in chocolate-
covered cherry recipes using prepared fondant. Also good to flavor
and color many ways. Pure white when finished. In a saucepan, combine
all ingredients except vanilla. Mix well; cover and cook 3 minutes,
then remove lid. Continue cooking without stirring to 240 degrees F.
Pour fondant at once on a cold surface. Cool to lukewarm (about 110
degrees F.). Work with spatula until white and creamy. Knead with
hands until smooth; add vanilla. Knead until well blended. Let stand,
uncovered, until cold, then wrap in waxed paper and store in a
tightly covered jar in refrigerator or other cool place to ripen for
at least 24 hours before using. Fondant may be kept for several
weeks. Makes about 50 centers.
