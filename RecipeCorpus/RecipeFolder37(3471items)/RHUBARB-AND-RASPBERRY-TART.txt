Categories: Fruit, Pie/tart, Desserts, Canadian
Yield: 8 servings
1    Egg yolk
1/2 c  Whipping cream

Raspberries and rhubarb in one tart means that one of the fruits must
be frozen if locally produced products are to be used. Happily, this
dish works well with either fresh or frozen berries or rhubarb. The
reds and pinks are beautiful together and the flavours blend
wonderfully. 1. Roll out pie dough into 10-inch tart or pie pan.
2. Cut rhubarb into 1/4 inch pieces, distribute evenly in tart shell,
then sprinkle with raspberries.
3. Combine sugar, eggs and egg yolk in a mixing bowl; whisk
ingredients together.
4. Add cream and vanilla and mix.
5. Pour egg mixture over fruit and bake in preheated 400F(200C) oven
for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tart batter is quite firm.
