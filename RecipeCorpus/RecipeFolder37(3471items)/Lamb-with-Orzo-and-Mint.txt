Title: Lamb with Orzo and Mint
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Pepper
6 lg Shallots
4 tb Butter
1/2 c  Shredded mint leaves
1 c  Orzo
1 lb Lamb tenderloin
Or boneless leg of lamb
3/4 ts Salt
1. Cook the orzo in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender
but still firm, 7-8 min. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, cut the lamb into 1-inch cubes and season with  1/4 tsp
each of salt and pepper. Slice the shallots.

3. In a large frying pan, heat 3 tbs of butter over medium-high heat
until bubbly but not brown. Add the lamb and cook, turning, until
brown and crispy outside but still pal pink in the center, about 1-1
1/2 min per side. Remove the lamb to a plate, reserving the drippings
in the pan.

4. Add the shallots to the frying pan and cook until lightly browned,
2-3 min. Return the lamb and any accumulated juices to the pan. Add
the shredded mint and the remaining 1 tbs butter.

5. Season with the remaining salt and pepper, add the cooked orzo and
toss over very low heat to heat through.
