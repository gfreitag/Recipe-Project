AVOCADO SALAD

Judging by its popularity, you would think that the avocado has been
grown in Israel for many years.  In fact, until recently, they were
not grown in Israel at all.  Today, the avocado is an Israeli
favorite and avocado fields
dot the countryside.

Cut avocado in half, scoop out fruit.  Add chopped eggs, onion,
seasonings and lemon juice.  Serve on lettuce.
