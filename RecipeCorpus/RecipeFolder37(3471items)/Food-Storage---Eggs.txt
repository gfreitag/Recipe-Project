Recently there has been increased concern about eggs and salmonella
bacteria.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the FDA recommend the safe
egg-handling guidelines below. This is especially true for people who
may be more susceptible to illness such as the elderly, very young
children, pregnant women (because of risk to the fetus) and those
with weakened immune systems.

Avoid eating raw eggs and foods containing raw eggs. Commercial
products are made with pasteurized eggs and are safe because
pasteurization destroys salmonella.

Cook eggs thoroughly until both the yolk and white are firm, not
runny.

Refrigerate eggs in their original carton as soon as possible at a
maximum temperature of 40 degrees f.

Use raw eggs within 5 weeks and hard-cooked eggs in one week.

Don't keep eggs (raw and hard-cooked) out of the refrigerator more
than 2 hours, including time for preparing and serving.

Wash hands, utensils, and work areas with hot, soapy water before and
after they come in contact with eggs and egg-rich foods.

When refrigerating a large amount of hot egg-rich dish or leftovers,
divide it into several small shallow containers so it will cool
quickly.
