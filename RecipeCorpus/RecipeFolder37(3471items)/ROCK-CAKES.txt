A staple at English boarding schools, these individual cakes are
served with afternoon tea.  They don't keep well; after a day they
take on the characteristics of "rocks". Preheat oven to 400F (205C).
Grease a large baking sheet; set aside. Sift flour, baking powder,
salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves into a large bowl. With your
fingers, rub in butter and shortening until mixture is crumbly. Stir
in raisins, walnuts, brown sugar, and lemon peel. Add egg and just
enough milk to make a stiff dough. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2
inches apart on baking sheet.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden
brown.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve fresh.  Makes about 15
rock cakes.
