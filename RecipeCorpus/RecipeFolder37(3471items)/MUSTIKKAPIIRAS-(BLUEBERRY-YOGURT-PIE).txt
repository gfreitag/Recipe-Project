Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Pie/tart, Ethnic
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 c  Unbleached white flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
2 c  Blueberries, fresh or frozen
2    Eggs
3 tb Sugar
1 c  Plain yogurt
Butter and flour a 9 or 10 inch pie pan.  Preheat the oven to 350.

Using an electric mixer or by hand, cream the butter and sugar.  Add
the egg, and blend well.  Combine the flour and baking powder and mix
them into the wet ingredients to form a soft dough.  With flour
dusted fingers, pat the sticky dough into the bottom of the buttered
and floured pie pan. Push the dough up to cover the sides of the pan.
Refrigerate for at least as long as it takes to make the filling.

Mix all the filling ingredients, except the blueberries, until
smooth. Put the berries into the pie shell and gently pour in the
filling so the berries are coated and evenly distributed.

Bake for 50 - 60 minutes, until the crust is browned and the custard
has set.  Chill well before serving.
