Title: Senate Bean Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Smoked Ham Hock
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 c  Mashed Potatoes
2 tb Liquid Smoke
1 lb Pea Beans, Rinsed
8 c  Water
2 tb Bacon drippings
1 ea Large Onion, chopped
2 ea Ribs celery, chopped
1 ea Clove garlic, minced
In kettle bring beans and water to boil;boil 2 minutes. Cover, turn
off heat and let stand 1 hour. In skillet in hot fat, saute
onion,celery and garlic until lightly browned. Add to beans and cook
until tender (about 1 hour). Remove ham hock, skin and cut off meat
and mince. Reserve meat.Give bone to dog or cat. Stir in salt and
pepper and with potato masher, mash beans slightly. Stir in potatoes,
stir until smooth. Add hock meat and heat through. Stir in liquid
smoke and serve and enjoy.

The best way to bring out the flavor of this soup is to make it 2
days in advance. I usually let it cool after cooking and then store in
the fridge, covered, for 2 days and then SLOWLY reheat the soup until
hot. The key word here is SLOWLY. Do not allow the soup to boil.
