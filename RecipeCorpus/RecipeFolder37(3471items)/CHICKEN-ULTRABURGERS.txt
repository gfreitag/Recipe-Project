1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 c  Cooked brown rice
1 tb Olive oil with a dash of
-dark toasted sesame oil
1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
-meat (white and dark)
1    Onion, peeled and quartered
1/4 c  Fresh parsley leaves
1/4 c  Fresh parsley stalks
2 tb Dijon mustard
Chop meat into small pieces. Place the onion, parsley, mustard, salt
and pepper into food processor. Pulse until onion is minced but not
pureed. Transfer to large bowl and set aside. Process meat, in 2
batches if necessary, for about 20 pulses. Transfer to bowl withonion
mixture. Add the rice and stir until well mixed. Form into 4 patties.
(It's easier to make patties if the mixture is chilled for an hour.)
Heat oil in large skillet. Cook chicken burgers 4 minutes each side.

Serve on whole wheat buns with lettuce and tomato.

I made these a couple of nights ago....really flavorful!! I didnt'
have any onion and they still were fantastic. I also found that I had
lots of meat after de-boning the chicken...it made about 6 patties.
