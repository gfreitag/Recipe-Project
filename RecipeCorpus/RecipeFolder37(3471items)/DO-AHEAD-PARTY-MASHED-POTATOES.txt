smooth with potato masher or electric mixer.  Mix cream cheese with
sour cream or yogurt, onion salt and pepper.   Beat into the potatoes
and beat with a whisk until smooth and fluffy.  Taste for seasoning:
you may wish to add a teaspoon of plain salt.  Place in two-quart
casserole or a refrigerator container.  Cool and cover. To serve,
place desired amount in greased casserole, dot with butter or
margarine and sprinkle with paprika or top with lots of cheese

minutes, uncovered, until heated through. Makes 8-10 servings. Tastes
best if refrigerated 12-24 hours before baking. Can be kept in
covered refrigerator container for up to two weeks. POTATOES WITH
CHIVES: Instead of 2 tsp. onion salt, use 1 tsp garlic salt or onion
salt, 1 tsp. plain salt, and one tbsp. minced freeze-dried or fresh
chives.
