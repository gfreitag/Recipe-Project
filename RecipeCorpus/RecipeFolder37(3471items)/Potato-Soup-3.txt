This is a very good recipe that I have modified slightly.  It calls
for the potatoes to be pureed, but I prefer a chunky soup.

In a sauce pan bring first 5 ingredients to a boil; reduce heat;
cover; simer 20 minutes, or until tender.

In a heavy pan cook flour in butter 1 minute, stirring; add seasonings
and milk; cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened; add
potatoes; mix well; heat.  Add cheese; stir until melted.
