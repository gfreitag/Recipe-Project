MEAT CHOLENT

Cholent, a heavy stew, became the answer to the age-old problem of
how to have nourishing hot food on the Sabbath without violating
injunctions in Jewish traditional law.  Since it is permitted to
prepare food in advance and keep it warm in an oven lit before the
Sabbath began, cholent, which it is not impaired by long, slow
cooking (indeed the process improves the flavor), was adopted as the
principal Sabbath food in eastern Europe.

In Israel, cholent has become exceedingly popular with every segment
of the population.  There are even restaurants where one sees lines
of customers standing with pot-in-hand waiting for their turn to get
"take-home" cholent.

Cholent is served only on weekends.  Anyone who partakes of this dish
will understand why.  It is a thick, heavy, and filling food which
induces sleep.

Soak the beans overnight in water.  Drain.  Use a heavy saucepan or
Dutch oven and brown meat and onions in the fat (or margarine).
Sprinkle with salt, pepper and ginger.  Add beans, barley, small
potatoes (peeled) and sprinkle with flour and paprika.  Place
uncooked eggs in shells on top. Add
enough boiling water to cover one inch above the mixture.  Cover
tightly. Cholent may be baked for 24 hours at 250 deg F (125 deg C)
or for quicker cooking, bake at 350 deg F (180 deg C) for 4-5 hours.
Serves 8-10.
