** Optional
Bring soup stock to a boil, add shredded pork, black mushrooms and
wood ears. Cook 2-3 minutes. Add remainder of ingredients and
seasonings (except cornstarch, eggs, and green onion) reduce heat and
simmer for 2 minutes. Thicken with cornstarch and turn off heat.
Slowly pour in beaten eggs in a thin stream while stirring. Serve
immediately. Garnish with green onion.
If soup is to be prepared ahead of time, do not add cornstarch and
eggs until serving time. Otherwise the egg will be overcooked and
spoil the appearance. Soup should be quite hot and sour. Adjust the
hotness with varying amount of white pepper and the sourness with
different amounts of vinegar.
