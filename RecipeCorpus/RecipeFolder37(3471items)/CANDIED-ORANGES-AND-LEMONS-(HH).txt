A simplified version of a fruit confit that traditionally is included
in the 13 or more sweets served at Reveillon in France and Quebec.

Peel the fruits, removing bitter pitch.

In a medium saucepan (nonreactive) place a layer of sliced oranges and
sprinkle lightly with sugar.  Place a layer of lemon slices on top and
sprinkle with sugar. Continue adding fruit in alternating layers,
each time sprinkling with sugar, until all the fruit and sugar are
used.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Place uncovered saucepan over medium-low heat and bring fruit and
sugar to a light boil, stirring occasionally, approximately 30
minutes.  Allow fruit to cool.  Stir in Creme de Cassis and serve
with chocolate cake or mousse.
