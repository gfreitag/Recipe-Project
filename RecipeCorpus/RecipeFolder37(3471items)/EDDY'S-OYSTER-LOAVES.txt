Categories: Fish/seafoo, Main dish, Breads
Yield: 6 servings
3    Doz fresh oysters
2 tb Melted butter
Milk
3 sm Loaves French Bread
1/2 ts Garlic powder
2 tb Melted butter
First, almost split the loaves lengthwise, leaving a hinge. Scoop out
the soft middle and save the crumbs. Then add a 1/2 tsp of garlic
powder (not salt) to 2 Tbls melted butter, and brush the cavities.

Next, drain the oysters and save the liquid.  Saute' them in the rest
of the butter till the edges curl - about 5 minutes. Put the oysters
into the loaves, mix the crumbs you saved with the oyster liquid you
saved, and add them, too.  Shut up the loaves now. STOP HERE.

Then wrap them in cheesecloth dipped in milk, twisting the ends and
tucking them under the loaf.  Bake them on a baking sheet for half an
hour at 350^. Cut them in half before you serve them.

6 servings

(Note from the book: Eddy was a San Franciscan who owned a bar and
made small oyster loaves for his married male customers to take home
to their wives. These were pacifiers. But Eddy is dead now, and
Mother must pacify herself.  This is good for a special lunch. I also
know a family who has it traditionally as Christmas Eve supper.)
