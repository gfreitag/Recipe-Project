Title: CHESTNUT MERINGUES
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 servings
4    Marrons glaces; chopped
2 ts Superfine sugar
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Superfine sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
1 ts Sweetened hot chocolate mix
Grease several baking sheets; line with parchment or waxed paper.
Preheat oven to 275 F (135 C). In a very clean grease-free bowl, beat
egg whites until very stiff, but not dry. Add 1/2 tablespoon of the
1/2 cup sugar; beat until sugar is incorporated and meringue is stiff
and shiny. Add remaining sugar, a little at a time, beating well
after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Carefully fold in chopped
marrons glaces. Using two small teaspoons, spoon small oval shapes of
mixture onto prepared baking sheets. Lightly sprinkle remaining 2
teaspoons sugar over meringues. Bake meringues 1-1/4 hours or until
crisp and dry on outside, but soft in the center; cool. Sift hot
chocolate mix lightly over each meringue. Remove meringues from paper.
