SHAKSHOUKA (Eggs in Tomato Sauce)

A Sephardi favorite.  No Middle Eastern restaurant menu is complete
without it, though Hungarians also delight in this dish--with the
addition of lots of paprika.  Leshakshek means "to shake" in Hebrew.
Every cook from North Africa has his or her own personal version of
this egg and tomato dish. Whatever vegetable is used, it must be
fresh, not canned.

In a large frying pan, saut  onion until lightly browned.  Grate
tomatoes on
largest holes of a grater.  Mix grated tomatoes and onion, cover and
cook over low heat for 25 minutes.  Remove cover and break eggs over
the surface.
Stir gently to break yolks, cover and cook for about 3 or 4 minutes
until eggs are set.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Variations:  One minced garlic clove may be added to the onion, or 3
to 4 slices of red pimento may be sauteed with the onion.
