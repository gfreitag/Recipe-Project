Title: Texas Beef Loaf
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 1 meatloaf
1 1/2 c  Soda crackers, crushed,
-(about 1 package)
1/2 c  Celery, chopped, (about 1
-rib)
1 1/2 lb Ground chuck
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Evaporated milk (I have used
-fresh milk with no problem)
1 sm Onion, chopped fine
1 ts Salt
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
Combine all ingredients and mix well.  Pack in a baking dish.  Bake
at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Let sit for several minutes before
slicing.

I usually either cover the finished loaf with catsup, or pass the
bottle of catsup at the table.
