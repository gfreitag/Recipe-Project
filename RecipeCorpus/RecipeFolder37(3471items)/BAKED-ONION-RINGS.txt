1/2    Poultry seasoning
To 3/4 (ts or tb?)
1    Egg
4    Large onions

Slice the onions about 1/4-inch thick, separate them into rings and
soak in a small bowl of cold, salted water for about 30 minutes; then
drain and dry them on paper towels.
Combine the bread crumbs and poultry seasoning in a dish.  In a
second dish, mix the egg with 1 tablespoon of cold water and beat
well.  Dip the onion rings in the prepared crumbs, then in the egg
and then again in the crumbs.  Arrange them on a greased baking dish;
cover with foil and bake in a hot oven (400 degrees) for 10 minutes.
Uncover and continue baking about 20 minutes more or until they are
crispy; serve immediately.
