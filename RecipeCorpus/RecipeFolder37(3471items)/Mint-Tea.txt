MINT TEA
========
There is nothing like this drink to quench the thirst in Israel's hot
climate. During the summer months (June through September) people
look for ways to overcome the effects of the heat.  The natural mint
leaves which many Israelis grow at home are favored as a cooling
addition to tea and vegetable salads.

In a teapot or carafe put sugar, tea bags, mint leaves, and lemon
salt. Add
boiling water, cover and let steep.
