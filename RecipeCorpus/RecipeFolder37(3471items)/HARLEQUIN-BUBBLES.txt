Title: HARLEQUIN BUBBLES
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 servings
1 tb Chopped mixed candied fruits
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Superfine sugar
Grease several baking sheets; line with parchment or waxed paper.  In
a very clean grease-free bowl, beat egg whites until very stiff, but
not dry.  Add 1/2 tablespoon of the sugar; beat until sugar is
incorporated and meringue is stiff and shiny.  Add remaining sugar, a
little at a time, beating well after each addition.  Preheat oven to
275 F (135 C).  Using two small teaspoons, spoon very small mounds of
meringue onto prepared baking sheets, spacing apart.  Sprinkle each
meringue with a few pieces of candied fruit.  Bake meringues 1-1/4
hours or until crisp and dry on the outside, but soft in the center;
cool.  Remove meringues from the paper. Depending on the oven used,
it may be necessary to select a lower temperature to keep meringues
white.  Source: "The Book of Cookies" by Pat Alburey.
