Orange-flavor beef is a northern Chinese specialty. Ken Hom's version,
substituting fresh orange peel for the traditional dried tangerine
peel, is a little different. CUT THE BEEF into thin slices 2 inches
long, cutting against the grain. Put the beef into a bowl together
with the soy sauce, rice wine or sherry, ginger, cornstarch and 1
teaspoon of sesame oil. Mix well, then let the mixture marinate for
about 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet until it is
very hot. Remove the beef from the marinade with a slotted spoon. Add
it to the pan and stir-fry it for 2 minutes until it browns. Remove
it and leave to drain in a colander or sieve. Pour off most of the
oil, leaving about 1 teaspoon. Reheat the pan over a high heat and
then add the dried chiles. Stir-fry them for 10 seconds, and then
return the beef to the pan. Add the rest of the ingredients and
stir-fry for 4 minutes, mixing well. Serve the dish at once.
