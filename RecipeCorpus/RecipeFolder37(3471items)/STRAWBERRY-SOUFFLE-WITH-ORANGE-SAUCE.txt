Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Low cal/fat
Yield: 10 servings
MMMMM-----------------------SOUFFLE BATTER----------------------------
1 pn Salt
Vegetable cooking spray
Sugar; for greasing mold
2 pt Strawberries
1/4 c  Water
3/4 c  Sugar
6 lg Egg whites
MMMMM------------------STRAWBERRY-ORANGE SAUCE-----------------------
1 tb Orange liqueur
- such as Cointreau
1 pt Strawberries
2 tb Sugar
3 tb Orange juice
FOR THE SOUFFLE: Rinse, hull and puree the berries. Puree the berries
in a blender or food processor. Measure 2 cups puree. (Use any
remaining puree for the sauce.) Combine water and sugar in a 2-quart
saucepan and bring to a boil over low heat. Cook until the syrup
thickens, about 3 minutes. Increase heat and add puree, stirring to
dissolve any sugar which may have hardened when the puree was added.
Bring to a boil and cool. Thirty minutes before serving the souffle,
preheat the oven to 400F and set a rack in the lower part of the
oven. Spray a 2 1/2-quart oval gratin dish or rectangular glass
baking dish with vegetable cooking spray and sprinkle the inside of
the dish with sugar. Whip the egg whites with the salt until they
hold a soft peak. Fold in the cooled strawberry puree. Pour the
souffle batter into the dish and smooth the top of the batter with a
metal spatula. Bake about 15 minutes, until well risen and lightly
colored. Serve immediately. FOR THE STRAWBERRY-ORANGE SAUCE: While
the souffle is baking, combine the sauce ingredients in the blender
(adding any leftover puree) and puree. Place in saucepan and bring to
a boil and reduce for a minute or 2. Serve with the souffle. Vary
this souffle with other fruit or berries--use 2 cups of pureed,
strained fruit as a substitute for the strawberries.
