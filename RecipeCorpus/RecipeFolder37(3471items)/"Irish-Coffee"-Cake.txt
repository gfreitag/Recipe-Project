Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
4 oz Self-raising flour
2 tb Coffee essence**
4 oz Butter, at room temperature
4 oz Granulated sugar
2    Eggs
MMMMM---------------------IRISH COFFEE SYRUP--------------------------
4 tb Irish whiskey
150 ml Strong black coffee
4 oz Sugar (for coffee syrup)
MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
1 tb Whiskey, or to taste
Chopped nuts*
150 ml Heavy whipping cream
Confectioners'sugar to taste
*Or grated chocolate. **This is a concentrated, liquid coffee easily
found in Ireland, but probably not in the States. I would dissolve 2
T of a good instant coffee (Taster's Choice or something similar) in
an equivalent amount of water, and use that. -- Grease and flour an
8-inch cake pan (preferably a springform cheesecake pan). Preheat
oven to 350F. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then
beat in the eggs, adding a little flour and beating well after each
addition. Stir in the coffee essence, and mix thoroughly. Turn the
mixture into the prepared pan, and bake for 35-40 minutes until
springy to the touch. Turn out and cool on a wire rack. . To make the
Irish coffee syrup, put the coffee and sugar into a small pan and
bring up to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Then boil for 1
minute. Remove from heat and add the whiskey. . Wash and dry the pan
the cake was baked in, and return the cooled cake to it: then pour
the hot coffee syrup all over it. Leave in a cool place for several
hours, then turn out. Whip the cream until it's thick, sweeten
slightly with confectioners' sugar, and add whiskey to taste. Spread
the cake with the whipped cream and chill for an hour before
sprinkling with chopped nuts or grated chocolate.
