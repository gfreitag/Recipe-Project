Cake: Pre-heat oven to 350 F. Butter a 10"x15" jelly-roll pan and
line it with waxed paper. Sift together the first 4 ingreds. With a
mixer, at high speed, beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar until light,
about 5 min. On low speed, beat in pumpkin and vanilla. Gradually
beat in flour mixture until just combined. In another bowl beat egg
whites until foamy; beat in cream of tartar. Gradually beat in
remaining sugar until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/2 cup egg whites into
cake batter; then fold in the remaining whites. Spread batter in the
pan. Bake 12-15 min. until golden. Sprinkle a dish towel with icing
sugar; invert cake onto towel and roll up; cool.

Sauce: Combine milk, cocoa and cinnamon in a pot and cook over low
heat, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2-3 min. The sauce will
thicken more as it cools [stir in 1-2 tb water if it becomes too
thick]. Remove from heat and add vanilla.

Filling: beat cream cheese, icing sugar, zest and vanilla until
creamy, about 2 min.

To Assemble: Unroll cake; spread with filling and roll up. Pour on
sauce; garnish with orange slices.
