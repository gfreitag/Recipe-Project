Title: Oyster Fritters
Categories: Fish/seafoo, White house
Yield: 1 batch
4    Eggs; well-beaten
Flour
Oysters
1 c  Milk
Salt to taste
Select plump, good-sized oysters;  drain off the juice, and to a cup
of this juice add the milk, salt, eggs, and enough flour to make a
batter slightly thicker than pancake batter.

Envelop an oyster in a spoonful of this batter (some cut them in
halves or chop them fine) then fry in butter and lard, mixed in a
frying pan the same way we fry eggs, turning to fry brown on both
sides.  Send to the table very hot.

Most cooks fry oyster fritters the same as crullers, in a quantity of
hot fat, but this is not always convenient.  Either way they are
excellent.
