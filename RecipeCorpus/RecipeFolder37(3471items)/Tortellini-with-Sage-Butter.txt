Title: Tortellini with Sage Butter
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  Butter
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
9 oz Fresh cheese
Or herb-cheese tortellini
12    Sage leaves
1. Cook the tortellini in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, about 7 min. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, cut the sage leaves into small pieces. Cook the butter
in a medium frying pan over medium heat until it is lightly browned,
1-2 min (don't let it burn). Add the sage and cook, stirring
constantly, until it turn deep green, about 1 min.

3. Add the pasta to the pan with the sage butter. Cook, tossing
gently, until heated through, about 1 min. Season to taste with salt
and pepper.

4. Pour the tortellini into a serving bowl and sprinkle with the
Parmesan cheese. Toss well and serve immediately.
