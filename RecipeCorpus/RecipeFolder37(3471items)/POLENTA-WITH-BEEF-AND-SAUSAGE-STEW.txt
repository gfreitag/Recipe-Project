-JUDI M. PHELPS (G.PHELPS1)
1 3/4 lb Lean beef
3/4 lb Italian sweet sausage
2    Garlic cloves; mashed
10    Parsley sprigs; leaves only
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms
3 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Butter
2 oz Salt pork; diced
1/2 lb Onions; peeled and diced
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Bay leaf; crumbled
Cut the beef into 1/2-inch cubes.  Remove casing from the sausage
and cut the meat into 1-inch pieces.
Chop garlic and parsley together until almost pureed.
Cut the mushrooms into thin slices; or use 1/2 oz dried mushrooms
and soak them in 1/2 cup lukewarm water for 15 minutes. Drain, saving
the water, and chop the mushrooms.
Combine olive oil, butter, and salt pork in a saucepan; heat. Add
onions and saute slowly until medium brown. Add beef and sausage and
brown for 10 minutes.  Add garlic and parsley, black pepper and bay
leaf. Stir and cook for 10 minutes.  Add wine, stir, cover, and
simmer for 10 minutes. Add celery, carrot, tomatoes and mushrooms.
Stir and cook for 10 minutes longer.  Add hot water and water from
dried mushrooms if any. Stir, cover, and simmer for 40 minutes.
Grate a little nutmeg over the top and simmer, uncovered, for 10
minutes longer.  Test beef for doneness; taste for salt and add if
necessary, but salt pork may have added enough.
Divide the hot polenta among 4 to 6 warm plates.
Serve the stew and gravy over polenta.  Enjoy a bottle of
Valpolicella with it.
