Title: GARY'S BEEF STROGANOFF
Categories: Meats, Russian
Yield: 8 servings
3 tb Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1    Bay leaf
2 c  Beef stock
Salt
Pepper
Flour for dredging
2 lb Beef, 1" cubes
1 1/2 lb Mushrooms
3    Onions
2 tb Dill, fresh
25 oz Red Wine, dry, full bodied
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
1 tb Tomato paste
Peel and chop onions.  If large mushrooms are being used, slice into
rather large slices.  I prefer to use small mushrooms and leave the
whole.

Dredge beef cubes in flour and give them a light coating.  Heat a
large stewing pot and add olive oil.  Brown beef cubes thoroughly in
olive oil. Add onions, garlic and mushrooms and saute lightly.  Add
red wine (all) and enough beef stock to barely cover the ingredients.
Add bay leaf (broken) and   dill.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Add
tomato paste.  Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 2
hours or until beef is very tender.  The cooking liquid will thicken
from the flour in which you dredged the beef.  The desired result is
that the ingredients are coated with a thick gravy.  If more liquid
is needed during the cooking process, add additional beef stock
sparingly.  Be careful that you scrape the bottom of the pot when
stirring to prevent flour from sticking and burning.
Just before ready to serve, mix in 1 1/2 cups sour cream.  Place into
a casserole dish or tureen and garnish with sprigs of fresh dill.
Serve with rice or buttered noodles.
