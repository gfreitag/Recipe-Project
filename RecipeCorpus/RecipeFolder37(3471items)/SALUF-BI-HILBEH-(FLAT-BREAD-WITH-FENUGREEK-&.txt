Categories: Breads, Middle east

1/2 ts Salt
Oil or ghee
Hilbeh
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  -Warm water
2 c  Plain flour
2 c  Wholemeal flour
Makes 12 loaves Oven temperature: 260øC (500øF) Cooking time: 4
minutes each lot

Soak yeast in 1/4 cup water and stir to dissolve.

Sift flours into a mixing bowl, remove 1 cup flour and keep aside.

Blend remaining water and salt into yeast liquid and pour into flour.
Mix in a little of the flour to thicken liquid, cover and leave in a
warm place for 10-15 minutes until frothy. Blend in remaining flour
in bowl, then beat by hand for 10 minutes, or on electric mixer using
dough hook for 5 minutes.

Turn onto a floured board and knead in enough of the reserved flour
to make dough smooth and satiny. Return to bowl, sprinkle top of
dough lightly with flour and stretch a sheet of plastic film over top
of bowl. Leave in a warm place until doubled in bulk - about 30
minutes. Preheat oven.

Punch down dough and turn out on board.  Knead a little, then divide
into 12 equal portions.  Place a heavy flat griddle or baking sheet
on centre shelf in oven and heat for 10 minutes. Grease with a wad of
paper towelling dipped in oil.  Roll out each portion to a 15 cm (6
inch) round and prick with a fork. Brush top lightly with oil and
spread on 1 teaspoon hilbeh. Lift 2 loaves onto a lightly floured,
flat-edged baking sheet or plywood board and slide onto heated
griddle or baking sheet.

Bake in hot oven for 4 minutes.  Top may be lightly browned under a
hot grill.  As breads are removed, wrap in a cloth to keep them warm
and soft. Serve warm.

NOTE: If breads begin to puff up during cooking, press top with a
folded cloth.  Breads should be bubbly, but should not form a pocket.
