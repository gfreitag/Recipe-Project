Title: Fried Oysters
Categories: Fish/seafoo, White house
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM---------------------------RECIPE--------------------------------
Take large oysters from their own liquor into a thickly folded napkin
to dry them; then make hot two tablespoons each of butter and lard in
a thick-bottomed frying pan.  Season the oysters with pepper and
salt, then dip each one into egg and cracker crumbs rolled fine,
until it will take up no more.  Place them in the hot grease and fry
them a delicate brown, turning them on both sides by sliding a
broad-bladed knife under them. Serve crisp and hot.
