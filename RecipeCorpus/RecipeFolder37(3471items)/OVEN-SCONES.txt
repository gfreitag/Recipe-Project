The basic scone.  "To die for".

Preheat oven to 450F (230C).  Very lighty grease a large baking
sheet; set aside.  Sift flour, baking poder and salt into a large
bowl.  With your fingers, rub in butter until mixture is crumbly.
Make a well in center of mixture; add milk and mix with a fork to
make a dough that BARELY holds together (you may need to press dough
together with your hands).  Turn out onto a floured surface and knead
lightly just until smooth.  Roll out with a floured rolling pin or
pat dough with your hands to make a round about 3/4-inch thick.  Cut
in rounds with a 2-inch fluted or plain cookie cutter. Arrange 1 to 1
1/2-inches apart on baking sheet; brush tops lightly with milk.  Bake
8 to 10 minutes or until well risen and golden. Transfer to a wire
rack and cool 5 minutes.  Split and serve warm with clotted cream (if
you can get it!) or sweet butter or whipped cream, plus strawberry
preserves.  Makes about 12 scones. VARIATIONS: Rich Oven Scones: Add
1 tablespoon sugar to the dry ingredients. In place of the 2/3 cup
milk, use a mixture of 1 lightly beaten egg and 5 tablespoons milk.
