Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat. Add the
garlic and saute until it just starts to turn golden brown. Remove
from the heat and when the butter has stopped bubbling add the flour.
Return to the heat and cook, stirring constantly for two minutes. Do
not let the flour color! Remove from the heat and add the milk and
cream all at once. Immediatelt beat vigorously with a whip until
smooth. Put the pan over medium heat add the parsley and anchovies.
Cook, stirring constantly until the sauce has the constancy of heavy
cream. Remove from the heat. Add salt and pepper to taste, Reserve
uncovered.

In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, cottage cheese, Parmesan,
parsley basil, prosciutto and egg yolks. Add salt and pepper to
taste, and mix well.

Stuff each shell with some of the cheese mixture. Using your fingers,
press the long side of each shell lightly together so that the shape
of the shell is as it was before boiling. Wipe any excess of filling.

Put about two cup of the sauce in the bottom of a baking dish big
enough to hold all the 24 shells in one layer. Place the stuff shells
in the dish, pour the remaining sauce over.

Bake in a preheated oven at 375 F for 15 minutes. Serve at once.

In a few months I will have fresh basil in my garden....
