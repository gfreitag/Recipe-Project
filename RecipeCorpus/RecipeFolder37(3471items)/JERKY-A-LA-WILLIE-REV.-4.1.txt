Title: JERKY A LA WILLIE REV. 4.1
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/4 ts Garlic powder
2 1/2 ts Pepper
2 tb Brown sugar
Up to 3 lb lean meat **
10 oz Bottle of lo salt soy sauce
1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Liquid mesquite smoke *
1 1/4 ts Onion powder
*  use in place of smoker. ** beef, deer, elk etc.

Mix all ingredients except meat to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced
meat into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 12 to 24 hours (the longer
the better). Smoke using mesquite chips for about three hours and
then finish drying in oven. If doing whole operation in oven use
liquid smoke and hang strips of meat on highest rack and put shallow
pan underneath to catch drippings. Turn oven on and set to lowest
possible setting and leave for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried. A
couple of hints that I picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use
toothpicks or wooden skewers to hang meat by, and line the pan with
aluminum foil to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems
later on. If you have access to sweet onions (vidalias, etc) they can
be sliced and dried and then run through the blender to make an
excellent onion powder to be used in this recipe.
