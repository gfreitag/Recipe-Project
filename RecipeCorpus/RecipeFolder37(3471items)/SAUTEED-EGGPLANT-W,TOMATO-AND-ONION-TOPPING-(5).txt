Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Oregano, crushed
1/2 c  Dry red wine
4 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
2 tb Parsley
1    Eggplant, trimmed
1    Onion, chopped
3 tb Olive oil
2 cl Garlic, minced
2 ea Tomatoes, chopped
Cut eggplant into 1/2 inch slides, sprinkle with a little salt on both
sides (to draw out water), and let slices drain in colander for 30
minutes. While eggplant is draining, cook the onion in 1 tb olive oil
over moderate heat, stirring until golden; stir in garlic, tomatoes,
oregano and wine and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes,
or until liquid is almost evaporated.  Stir in the Parmesan cheese,
parsley and salt and pepper to taste; transfer the topping to a bowl,
cover and keep warm.
Brush salt from surfaces of eggplant, rinse quickly and pat dry.  In
the skillet, heat the remaining olive oil until hot, but not smoking
and cook the eggplant, browning on one side, then turn, reduce heat,
and cook an additional 5 minutes or more until tender.  Transfer to
plate, spoon the tomato and onion topping onto it, and serve with
additional cheese.
