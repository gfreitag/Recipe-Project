Title: Vegetable Tea
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
1    Bay leaf
1    Sprig parsley
1    Sprig thyme
1    Sprig tarragon
8    Black peppercorns
Water
Truffle oil
2    Tomatoes
Seeded and chopped
7    Carrots, sliced
2    Onion(s), sliced
1/2    Leek, sliced
1    Celery rib, sliced
2    Garlic clove(s), smashed
2    Shallots, sliced
In a 2-quart canning jar, combine all the ingredients. Add 3 cups
water to fill the jar almost to the top. Seal the jar, set it in a
medium saucepan and add enough water to the pan to reach about
halfway up the sides of the jar. Bring to a boil over moderately high
heat and cook for 2 1/2 hours; replenish the water in the pan as
needed. Let the jar cool completely before opening.

Strain the tea through a fine sieve into a saucepan, pressing lightly
on the vegetables, and boil over high heat until reduce to 2 1/2
cups, about 25 min. Ladle the tea into bowls, garnish with blanched
vegetable strips and add a few drops of truffle oil.
