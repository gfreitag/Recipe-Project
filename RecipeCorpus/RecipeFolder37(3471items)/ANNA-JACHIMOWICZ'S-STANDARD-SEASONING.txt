One standard seasoning Mrs. Jachimowicz uses is fried onions. She
usually makes a large quantity at once so she can add it to each dish
without preparing it each time. After finely chopping the onions, she
browns them with a little flour in vegetable oil. When they are
golden, she melts some butter in the pan. The oil prevents the onions
from burning and the butter is added for flavor. She also seasons
most of her foods with seasoned salt, celery salt or savory.
