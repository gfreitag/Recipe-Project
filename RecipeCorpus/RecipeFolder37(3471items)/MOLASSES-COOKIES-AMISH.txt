Title: MOLASSES COOKIES AMISH
Categories: Cake/cookie, Penndutch
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 c  Milk
3 ts Baking soda
1 ts Ginger
2 ts Cinnamon
6 c  Flour
1 c  Shortening
1 1/2 c  Sugar; brown
2    Eggs
1 c  Molasses
1 c  Syrup, corn white or golden
This is from an Amish cookbook. I have modified the directions to
explain better: Cream the shortening and sugar. Add the eggs,
molasses and syrup. Then sift together the dry ingredients and
alternately stir in the flour and milk.  Bake for 5 to 8 minutes in a
375 degree oven. The molasses in the cookies make them very prone to
burn so check often.. the recipe could be halved as this makes about
80 cookies!!
