Title: STUFFED CUCUMBER
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Dried dill weed
Paprika
1    Straight cucumber
125 g  (4oz) Cream cheese, softened
1/2 ts Dry onion flakes, crushed
Score cucumber all around by scraping from top to bottom with fork
tines. Cut ends off and scoop out seeds from center. A small spoon
and a vegetable corer work well. Be sure to remove all seeds because
that is the part where most of the moisture is.
Mash cheese with a fork. Add onion and dill. Mash together. Stuff
cucumber. Wrap and chill.
To serve, slice and sprinkle with paprika. May be served as is or on a
cracker.
