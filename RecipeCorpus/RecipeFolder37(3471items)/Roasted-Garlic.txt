Categories: Appetizers, Condiments, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Fresh thyme; chopped
1 tb Fresh rosemary; chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
2 lg Garlic heads; whole and
- unpeeled
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Place the garlic in a small roasting pan or ovenproof skillet and
drizzle the oil on top.  Sprinkle with the herbs, a pinch of salt,
and a generous grinding of pepper.

Roast the garlic until soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove from the
oven and serve.

Roasted garlic can be used in any number of ways - aside from making
your house smell like heaven.  It can be squeezed out of its papery
skin and spread on thinly sliced toast, pizza, or bruschetta; placed
on top of fish, beef or poultry dishes;  mixed into pasta sauces or
dips; or served as a side dish to just about any meal.
