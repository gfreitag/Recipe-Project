Title: FAUX-FRESH TOMATO SOUP
Categories: Soup/stew, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Basil leaves; dried
3/4 ts Sugar
1/2 ts White pepper
2 ts Vegetable oil; optional
From: Gaye Levy
1    Onion; medium, chopped
1    Carrot; large, chopped
4 c  Chicken broth; reg strength
1 cn Tomato puree; 15 oz.
Spray the bottom of a 3 to 4 quart pan with PAM, or optionally, coat
with oil. Add the onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally,
until both the onion and the carrot are sweet tasting and tender when
pierced. This will take about 30 minutes.  Stir broth, tomato
puree, basil sugar and pepper into pan. Bring to a boil on high heat.
Cover and simmer to blend flavors, about 15 minutes.  With a
slotted spoon, scoop vegetables and a little of the broth into a food
processor or blender. Whirl until smoothly pureed. Pour vegetable
mixture back into the pan; heat until steaming. Ladle into bowls and
enjoy.   Notes from Gaye: This recipe is adapted from Sunset
Magazine, circa 1987. What could be more filling (and warming) this
time of year than a large bowl of soup and some fresh bread? For the
bread, try the Italian Bread which is as lo-cal as bread can go...and
go easy on the butter or margarine.
