Peel cucumbers if desired.  Cut cucumbers crosswise into 1-inch thick
sections; remove center of each section.  Spoon about 1 level
tablespoon of filling into each section.  Lightly coat with
cornstarch, shaking off excess.  Set aside.
Cooking: Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2
inches. Place over high heat until oil reaches 360 to 375 degrees F.
Add cucumber sections, a few at a time, and deep fry for 2 minutes.
Lift out and drain on paper towels.  Cook remaining cucumber.
Place fried cucumber sections in a wide frying pan with a nonstick
finish. Pour in sauce and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and
simmer for 8 to 10 minutes.  Add corn starch solution and cook,
stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.  Arrange on a serving
platter and serve hot. Serves 4 as a Main dish, but also makes a nice
hors d'oeuvre for more.
