Categories: Main dish, Fish/seafoo, Appetizers, Microwave
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Thin sliced fresh mushrooms
4 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Light cream
Paprika
Butter or margarine
2 1/2 lb Salmon-stuffed sole fillets
Salt and pepper, to taste
1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
1 c  Dry white wine
1. Butter a shallow, heat-resistant, non-metallic baking dish lightly.
Place
stuffed-sole fillets in baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to
taste.
2. Sprinkle onions over fish fillets and pour wine over fish. Heat,
covered with clear plastic wrap, in Microwave Oven 7 to 8 minutes or
until fish flakes easily with a fork. Baste fish with wine and onions
several times during cooking. Set poached fish aside.
3. In a medium-sized, heat-resistant, non-metallic bowl melt the 1/3
cup butter or margarine in Microwave Oven 45 seconds. Add mushroom
slices and heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 2 minutes.
4. Blend in flour until smooth. Gradually add cream, stirring until
smooth. Return sauce to Microwave Oven and heat, uncovered, 4 to 5
minutes or until mixture is thickened and smooth. Stir occasionally.
5. Add 1/2 cup fish liquid from baking dish to mushroom sauce and stir
until
well blended.
6. Place fish fillets on a heat-resistant, non-metallic serving
platter. Spoon mushroom sauce over fish. Heat, uncovered, in
Microwave Oven 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with
paprika just before serving. Note: Many fish markets sell sole
pre-stuffed with salmon However, if this is
not available, you can roll a piece of fresh salmon (about 1-inch in
diameter
and 4-inches long) in a small fillet. Fasten each roll with a
toothpick. Unstuffed sole or sole that has been stuffed with shrimp,
clams, scallops or
crabmeat can also be used for this recipe. It is advisable to roll
sole fillets even though they may not be stuffed.
