Slice beef thin across the grain.  Mix marinade, add beef slices.  Let
stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.  Mix sauce ingredients in a
small bowl.  Set aside.  Cut ends off hot red peppers, shake out
seeds, chop skins into small pieces.

Heat a large non-stick skillet or wok over high heat.  Add 2 Tbsp.
oil and swirl to coat the pan.  Add chopped hot red peppers, stir
until pepper skins turn black.  Remove blackened skins from oil.  Add
beef and marinade to hot oil.  Stir fry beef until the beef loses its
red color and is browned and has a satiny sheen.  Remove from pan
into a large bowl.

Add 1 Tbsp. oil to the skillet and add onion.  Stir-fry 1 to 1 1/2
minutes. The onion should be crisp tender.  Remove from pan to bowl
with the beef mixture.  Add 1 Tbsp. oil to the skillet, stir-fry
green pepper until bright green color, about 1 minute.  Reduce heat
to medium.  Add beef-onion mixture from the bowl along with the sauce
mixture.  Cook until the sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes.  Remove
to a serving bowl. Sprinkle with chopped onion and beer nuts.  Serve
immediately with rice. Note: Cabbage can be stir fried with the onion
if desired.
