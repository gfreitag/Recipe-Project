Title: PARMESAN ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 16 rolls
Butter (or marg.); melted
1    Egg; beaten (optional)
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
1 pk Hot roll mix (13-3/4 oz)
Combine cheese and flour mixture from hot roll mix; prepare dough,
and let rise according to package directions.

Divide dough into 16 equal portions; shape as desired, and place on a
lightly greased baking sheet.  Brush rolls with butter.  Cover and
let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk (about 30 to 45
minutes). Brush with egg, if desired.  Bake at 375 degrees for 12 to
15 minutes or until golden brown.

Note: With the addition of parmesan cheese, basic hot roll mix becomes
Parmesan Rolls that taste like you made them from scratch.
