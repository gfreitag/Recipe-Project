Title: TOLLHOUSE BUSCUITS
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 20 servings
1/2 c  Nestle's toll house morsels
1 c  Milk
2 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/3 c  Butter flavored shortening
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Mix the dry ingredients well.  Cut in the shortening until mixture is
mealy.  Add the chocolate chips and milk.  Stir until all of the
flour is absorbed.  Turn out on a floured surface and knead 15
strokes. (meaning flatten to about an inch and fold in half, then do
again.)  Roll, or press, to 1/2 inch thickness.  Using a 2 inch
cutter, cut the dough. Place the circles on an ungreased cookie
sheet, not touching.  Bake them until browned on top.  Remove them to
a serving plate and enjoy.
