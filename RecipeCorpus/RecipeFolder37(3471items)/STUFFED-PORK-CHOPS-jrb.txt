Categories: Main dish, Meats, Poultry
Yield: 2 servings
1    Stalk celery, chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
4 ea PORK CHOPS 3/4 -1" THICK
1 pk BREAD STUFFING MIX
1/2 cn ARTICHOKE HEARTS
1 md COARSELY CHOPPED ONION
Cut "pocket" in meaty side (edge) of each pork chop
Saute in butter along with onions and celery , just until brown ( do
NOT cook through) Allow chops to cool. Prepare stuffing, add chopped
artichoke hearts and cooked onions. Overstuff "pocket" tightly and
bake in 350 degree oven 45 min or until excess stuffing is browned.

Thin chops may be used as well, just sandwich stuffing between 2
chops... and cut down cooking time a little.
Any excess stuffing may be baked off separately in a pan.
Works well for poultry too!
If you have a real hearty eater, you may have to serve 2 to a portion
