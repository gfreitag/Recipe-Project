2 tb Cooking oil

1.  In a Dutch oven, or large pan with a tight-fitting cover, brown
meat in fat.  Season with salt and pepper and remove from pan. Pour
off fat drippings.  Add water. 2. Return meat to pan and sprinkle
with dill seed. Place onion slices on top. 3. Cover and simmer for 2
1/2 to 3 hours, or until done.  (Or cook in a 325F oven for same
amount of time.) 4. When done, remove meat and onion to a platter and
keep warm. 5. For 2 cups of gravy, pour liquid from pan into a 2-cup
measuring cup. Let stand for 1 minute to allow fat to come to top.
Discard all but 4 Tablespoons (or less) of fat.  Add enough water (or
other liquid) to measure 1 1/2 cups of liquid.  Return to pan. 6. In
same cup, measure 1/2 cup cold water and blend in flour. Add mixture
slowly to liquid in pan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and
cook until thickened, about 3 minutes. 7. Remove pan from heat.  Add
sour cream, a small amount at a time, and mix well. Taste gravy and
correct seasoning, if necessary, with salt and pepper. If gravy is
not hot enough when ready to serve, place pan over very low heat, but
do not boil, or gravy may curdle. (Note: The flavor of the gravy is
not affected should curdling occur.) 8. Slice meat, and serve gravy
separately.
