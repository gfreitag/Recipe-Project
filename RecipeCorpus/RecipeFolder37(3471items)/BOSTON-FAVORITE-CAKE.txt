1 3/4 c  Cake flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Milk
6 tb Butter
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs, separated
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1.  Preheat oven to 350F.
2.  Butter and lightly flour two 8" round cake pans.
3.  Cream the butter until softened and slowly add the sugar, beating
until light.  Add the egg yolks and vanilla and beat to blend
well. 4.  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt onto a piece of
waxed paper.
Alternately blend the dry ingredients and the milk into the butter
mixture in three stages.  Beat until smooth.
5.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.
Stir a third of the whites into the cake batter and gently fold in
the remaining.  Spoon into cake pans.
6.  Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a straw inserted in the center of
the cake comes out dry.  Cool in pans for 5 minutes before turning
out onto racks.
