Chow mein literally means stir-fried noodles. It's a quick and
delicious way to prepare egg noodles.

IF YOU'RE USING DRIED NOODLES, cook according to package
instructions, then cool them in cold water until you're ready to use
them. If you're using fresh Chinese noodles, boil them for 3-to-5
minutes, then immerse in cold water. Using a cleaver or sharp knife,
slice the chicken into shreds 2 inches long. Mix chicken with the 2
teaspoons of light soy sauce and rice wine or sherry in a small bowl.
Mix well. Let the chicken marinate at room temperature about 10
minutes. Heat a wok or large skillet. Add the 2 teaspoons of oil,
then the chicken shreds. Stir-fry about 2 minutes, then transfer to a
plate. Clean the wok. Drain the noodles, shaking off as much water as
possible. Reheat the pan, add the 1 tablespoon of oil and garlic.
Stir-fry for 10 seconds, then add the snow peas and ham. Stir-fry
about 1 minute, then add the noodles, sugar, 1 teaspoon of soy sauce
and scallions. Continue to stir-fry about 2 minutes, then return the
chicken to the noodle mixture. Continue to stir-fry about 3 to 4
minutes or until chicken is cooked. Add the sesame oil and give the
mixture a few final stirs. Turn onto a warm platter and serve at once.
