Title: MALTESE SAUCE  (MALTESER SOSSE)
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Aust/german, Meats, Fish/seafoo, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Butter, cut in small pieces
1 ts Lemon juice
Salt
White pepper
5 tb Fresh whipped cream *
1/2    Blood orange or reg. ogange
1    Green onion, finely chopped
1 tb Dry white wine
1 tb White wine vinegar
3 tb Chicken stock
2    Egg yolks, slightly beaten
* 3 to 5 tablespoons of REAL whipped cream...NO substitutes.

This sauce needs to be made with extra care. Cut peel from half the
orange, removing only the colored portion. Cut peel into fine narrow
strips. Blanch peel briefly in boiling water, if desired. Finely chop
peel, if desired; set aside. Juice orange; set aside. In a small
skillet, simmer green onion 5 minutes over low heat in wine, vinegar
and stock. Strain well, discarding green onion; cool slightly. Place
egg yolks and wine mixture in a small enamel-lined saucepan. Place
over hot water or use a double-boiler. Water should be barely
simmering at any time. If mixture is over heated it will curdle and
must be remade from new ingredients. Add butter, one piece at a time,
mixing well and making sure each piece is fully incorporated before
adding the next. If desired use a whisk to beat butter into yolk
mixture. When all butter has been added, sauce should be fairly thick
and creamy. Add lemon juice, salt, white pepper, balnched orange peel
and juice. Fold in whipped cream before serving. Serve immediately to
prevent sauce from seperating. This sauce is delicious with delicate
fish or vegetable dishes, such as asparagus. It is also very good
with broiled meat. Makes 4 servings.
