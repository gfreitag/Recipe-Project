Categories: Breads, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Sourdough starter
-CORNSTARCH MIX
1/2 ts Of cornstarch
1/4 c  Of hot water
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 pk Dry yeast
1/4 c  Water
In a large bowl... Mix the dry yeast in body-heat water (about 1/4 to
1/2 cup) Add 2 cups of the flour, the starter, salt and sugar and
stir for about 10 minutes

When smooth, cover with a damp towel and let rise for at least 1 1/2
hours

Stir in one cup of flour, or enough to make the dough rigid.

Knead dough on a well-floured bread board for 10-15 minutes Roll into
a long loaf or form into a round ball, depending on your preference
Place on a baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal Cover with a damp
towel and let rise for at least 1 1/2 hours

with this recipe the long rise times allow you to enjoy a ball game,
read the Sunday paper, trim your toe nails, and mow the lawn

Place a pan in the bottom of the oven, and fill it with boiling water
(this, she told me, is the secret weapon)

Mix 1/2 t of cornstarch in about 1/4 cup of hot water

Make several diagonal slices in the top of the loaf to prevent it from
breaking up when it fills with steam; brush the loaf with the corn
starch mixture

Place the loaf (on the bread pan sprinkled with corn meal) in the oven
above the water pan and bake at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes

Remove from the oven, and brush again with the corn starch mixture

Remove the water pan from the oven and refill it with cold water

Place the bread and water pan back in oven (water pan below the
bread) and bake for about 25 minutes From: Norman Williams Date:
