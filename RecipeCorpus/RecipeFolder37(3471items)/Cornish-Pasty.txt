Here is a recipe for Cornish type pasties...we lived there for several
years and enjoyed them a lot! First make the pastry by sifting the
salt and flour, then rubbing in the fat with the fingers until it is
coarse like breadcrumbs.  Add enough water gradually to make a stiff
dough kneading lightly with your hands until it is smooth.  Wrap in
cling film and chill 30 min.  Trim the meat very well, taking out
fat, bone or gristle, then cut into very small slivers.  Peel the veg
and coarsely grate or chop and mix all together with about 3-4
tablespoons water and season very well.  Roll out the pastry on a
floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick and cut into 4 circles about
8 inches in diameter.  Divide the mixture between the 4 circles
filling only 1/2 of the circle.  Dampen the edges with cold water,
fold over to cover mixture and press with a fork or the fingers to
make it secure.  Brush over with milk and make a small slit on top.
Put onto baking sheet and bake in a hot preheated, 425 degrees for 15
minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees for about 35-40 minutes.  If
getting too brown, the cover the top loosely with foil.

Fitzgibbon (I took the liberty of 'translating' some of the British
cooking terms and measurements)
