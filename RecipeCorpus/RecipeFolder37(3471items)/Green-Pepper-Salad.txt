GREEN PEPPER SALAD

This is a Romanian dish which is also featured in Middle Eastern
menus. Israeli green peppers are known for their sweetness.

Preheat oven to 400 deg F (210 deg C).  Place whole peppers on a flat
baking
tray and roast, turning often, until skin is soft.  Remove from oven
and peel. Remove seeds and cut peppers into strips.  In a non-metal
dish, mix oil, lemon juice and garlic.  Stir in pepper strips, season
with salt and pepper, and chill.
