make a soft dough.  Turn out on a floured board and let  rest 5
minutes.

Knead until smooth using only enough flour to keep from sticking to
board.  Put into greased bowl, turning once to coat.  Place in
slightly warmed oven (turn on for count of 30 to 60, turn off) and
let rise til doubled - about 1 hour.

Turn out onto floured board.  Divide for loaves, roll out into
rectangle, then roll up again, tightly.  Place in greased loaf pans,
tucking ends under.  Let rise in warm oven again for 3/4 hour until
doubled in size.

Bake at 400F for 40 to 50 minutes til brown, cool on wire rack,
enjoy.
