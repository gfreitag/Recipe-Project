Title: SPUD SCONES
Categories: Breads, Beverages, Vegetables
Yield: 12 servings
4 oz Self-rising flour,
-about 1 cup
Butter
1 lb Potatoes
2 ts Salt
3 tb Butter, room temperature
A great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.  Don't use instant
mashed potato mix, though, or you will not have a light scone.

Partially fill a large saucepan with cold water.  Peel potatoes; cut
in quarters and add to pan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover
and simmer briskly about 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
Drain well; place in large bowl and mash coarsely with a potato
masher or fork.  Add salt and 3 tablespoons butter and continue to
mash until potatoes are smooth.  Mix in enough flour, 1 tablespoon at
a time, to form a stiff dough.  Preheat griddle or heavy skillet over
high heat; grease lightly. Turn dough onto a floured surface and
knead lightly.  Roll out with a floured rolling pin to a thickness of
1/4-inch.  Cut into rounds with a 2-inch fluted or plain cookie
cutter.  Cook on griddle or skillet 4 to 5 minutes on each side or
until golden brown.  Serve hot with butter.  Makes 12-15 scones.
