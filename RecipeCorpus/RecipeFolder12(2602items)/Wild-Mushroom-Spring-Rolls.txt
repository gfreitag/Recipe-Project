Title: Wild Mushroom Spring Rolls
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Assorted mushrooms, such as
Shiitake or oyster or
Hanshimiji
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 lg Shallots, peeled and finely
Chopped
2 tb Finely grated ginger
2 ts Five spice powder
1/2 c  Finely chopped scallions
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Asian toasted sesame oil
1 lb Package egg roll wrappers
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Peanut oil for frying
Dipping sauce:
1/4 c  Warm honey
2 tb Soy sauce
Remove any hard fibrous stems from the mushrooms and clean carefully
by brushing the mushrooms with a damp cloth or mushroom brush to
remove excess dirt. Place the mushrooms in a food processor and pulse
quickly to chop into 1/4-inch bits.

Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat
until hot but not smoking. Add the mushrooms to the pan and saute
until the mushrooms begin to sweat, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the
chopped shallots and ginger and saute until translucent.

Sprinkle in the five spice powder and chopped scallions, season with
salt and pepper and stir in the sesame oil. Set aside to cool.

Lay out the egg roll wrappers and cut into 4 equal squares. Brush a
square of wrapper with some water, place a dollop of the mushroom
mixture in the center and roll the sides of the wrapper inwards to
enclose the filling. Rolling away from yourself, roll up the wrapper
into a cigar shape and enclose the filling completely. Seal the ends
with some of the water. Continue to finish filling the wrappers and
refrigerate them several hours to firm them before cooking.

Heat the oil in a deep skillet to 345 degrees. Fry the spring rolls,
in batches, until crisp.

In a bowl, combine the ingredients of the dipping sauce and serve
with the spring rolls.

Yield: 48 to 60 miniature spring rolls.
