Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Pie Dough
1    8-inch or 9-inch tart ring
Or false bottom tart pan
Cookie sheet
Parchment paper or aluminum
Foil
1    To 2 packages uncooked navy,
Pinto or similar bean
Thin slice of plain vanilla
Cake same size as tart pan
(optional)
1/2 c  Heavy cream
Pastry cream
Fresh fruit of your choice
Garnish: Apricot/Grand
Marnier Glaze, recipe
Follows
Make shell from pie dough to fit ring or tart pan. Be sure to use pie
dough that has been completely chilled. IT MUST BE COLD! Chill shell
after it has been formed before cooking. To cook shell, line cold raw
shell with parchment paper or aluminum circle that is cut 2 inches in
diameter larger than ring or pan. Fill lined shell to the brim with
raw beans. Bake shell at 375 for approximately 30 minutes or until
light brown. Let shell cool with beans still in place. While shell is
cooking, prepare the cream filling: Whip heavy cream until stiff. Add
chilled pastry cream to the whipped cream to taste. Refrigerate until
ready to use.

Assembly:

Remove beans from thoroughly cooled shell. Save the beans! They can
be used over and over as weights. Remove cooked shell from ring or
pan and place on serving platter. Fill shell with cream mixture.
Place thin slice of plain cake on top of cream. This will help
prevent heavy fruit from sinking into the pastry cream if the tart is
made hours in advance. Arrange fruit on top of cake in a design of
your taste. Garnish with Glaze.
