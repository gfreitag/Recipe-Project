Title: Roast Beef And Wild Mushroom Hash
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2    Russet potatoes, peeled,
Diced
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 lg Spanish onion, peeled and
Diced
1/4 lb Shiitake mushroom caps,
Julienned
2 lb Top round of beef, cut into
1/2    -inch cubes
1 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Chili pepper puree (ancho,
New mexico or california)
1/2 c  Fresh plum tomato dice,
Seedless
2 tb Chopped cilantro
1/2 c  Sugar snap peas, blanched
And julienned
Place the diced potatoes into a pot covered with cold water, set over
medium heat and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes for 12 minutes or
until softened but still firm, drain, and spread out on a cookie
sheet to cool quickly for 5 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a large
skillet, add the onion and cook to a light golden color before adding
the blanched potatoes. Cook the potatoes and onions for 4 to 5
minutes or until the potatoes begin to brown. Add the julienned
mushrooms to the skillet and cook for 3 to 4 additional minutes.

Season the vegetable mixture with salt and pepper, remove using a
slotted spoon, and add the cubed beef to the hot oil in one even
layer. Brown the beef over high heat, turning only when one side has
browned, and browning all sides evenly and quickly to maintain a
medium rare interior. The beef should brown in approximately 7 to 8
minutes. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Add the chili puree,
tomato dice and cilantro. Add the cooked onion potato mushroom mix
back to the pan and stir to combine. Press down along the edges so
that a crust forms along the bottom. Turn the cooked hash out onto a
plate and garnish with warm blanched sugar snap peas. Serve
{optional} with poached quail eggs.
