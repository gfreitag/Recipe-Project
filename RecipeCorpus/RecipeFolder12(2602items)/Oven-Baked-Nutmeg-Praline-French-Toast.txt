Categories:
Yield: 8 Servings
8 sl Italian bread, cut about
3/4    -inch thick
4    Eggs
1 c  Milk or half-and-half
2 tb Granulated sugar
2 tb Orange-flavored liqueur or
Orange juice
1/2 ts EACH vanilla and nutmeg
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Butter
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1/4 c  Firmly packed light brown
Sugar
1 tb Butter, melted
Place bread in single layer in 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish.  Whisk
together eggs, milk, sugar, liqueur, vanilla, nutmeg and salt.  Pour
over bread, turning once to coat evenly.  Refrigerate, covered,
several hours or overnight.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place 1/3
cup butter in 15 x 10-inch jelly roll pan; place in oven to melt
butter. Remove from oven; tilt pan to coat evenly with butter.
Arrange bread in single layer in prepared pan.  Bake, uncovered,
about 25 minutes or until firm and golden brown.  Meanwhile, combine
pecans, brown sugar and 1 tablespoon butter in small bowl.  Sprinkle
over baked french toast. Broil, about 5 inches from heat, watching
carefully, about 1 minute or until topping begins to bubble.

Variation:  Omit praline topping (made with pecans, brown sugar and
the 1 tablespoon melted butter).  Bake french toast as directed, but
carefully turn bread halfway through baking time.  Do not broil.

NOTE:  Other toppings include softened cream cheese combined with
maple syrup, sweetened whipped cream or butter with fruit preserves.
