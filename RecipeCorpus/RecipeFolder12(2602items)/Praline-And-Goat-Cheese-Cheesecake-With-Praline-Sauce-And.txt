Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl combine the crumbs,
pecans and butter together. Press into a 10-inch springform pan.
Allow the crust to come up the sides of the pan.

For the filling: In a food processor, combine the cheese, sugar and
sour cream and blend until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time until
incorporated. Dissolve the cornstarch in the cream and add to the
cream cheese mixture. Fold in the pralines and vanilla. Pour the
filling into the spring form and bake for 1 hour or until the cake
has set.

For the topping: Combine all the ingredients together and mix until
smooth. After removing from the oven, run a knife around the edges of
the pan to prevent the cake from cracking. After the cake has cooled
spread the topping evenly over the top of the cake and sprinkle the
top of the cake with the graham cracker crumbs. Place a piece of the
cake in the center of the plate. Drizzle the praline sauce over the
cake and sprinkle the pecans around the plate. Garnish with the
whipped cream and fresh mint.
