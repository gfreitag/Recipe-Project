Title: Red Garlic Soup
Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Chicken bones
1    Onion, quartered
1    Head garlic plus 6 cloves,
Minced and 3 cloves, halved
1/4 c  Plus 3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 lb Cured Spanish ham, or
Prosciutto, diced
1    Tomato, seeded and diced
2 ts Sweet paprika
6    Very thin slices country
Bread
8    Cumin seeds
8    Saffron threads
6    Eggs (optional)
Prepare the chicken stock by combining the chicken bones, onion, and
garlic head in a large pot. Add enough water to cover, about 1
gallon, and bring to a boil. Skim and discard foam that rises to the
top. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, about 1 hour,
periodically skimming foam from the top. If liquid is evaporating too
rapidly, add a cup or two of water. Strain by lifting liquid out with
a ladle. Discard the onion and garlic, and set aside to cool. Reserve
2 quarts for the soup, and save the extra for another use. (It will
keep in the refrigerator up to 5 days).

Heat the 1/4 cup olive oil in a large saucepan, add the 6 cloves
minced garlic, and saute until golden. Add the cured ham, and saute
for a minute. Add the tomato and paprika, and saute briefly, then add
the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, toast the bread, rub half a clove of the
remaining 3 garlic cloves over each piece, and drizzle with the
remaining olive oil. With a mortar and pestle, pound the leftover
garlic halves, cumin seeds, and saffron. Stir paste into the
simmering soup, and add the bread, breaking it up a bit.

If using eggs, break the eggs into the simmering soup and poach them
until set, but yolks still soft. Serve soup immediately, ladling it
into warm earthenware bowls.
