Title: Pate Sucree
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter,
Cold
1    Egg, lightly beaten plus ice
Water to equal 1/4 cup
Combine the flour, salt and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and
process a few seconds to mix.  Quarter the stick butter lengthwise
and cut into 8 or 9 pieces.  Scatter the cubes of butter evenly over
the flour. Pulse the machine until the butter pieces are about the
size of lentils. Place the lightly beaten egg in a 1/4 cup measure
and fill to the top with ice water.  Put half the liquid in the
bottom of a bowl. Turn the flour/butter mixture onto it and pour the
remaining liquid evenly over the top.  Using a large rubber spatula,
fold the mixture until it's evenly moistened.  Squeeze it; it should
hold together. If not, sprinkle in a little more water and gently
mix. Turn the mixture out on the table and quickly fraiser:  (Using
the palm of your hand, push sections of the dough away from you
against the table. Gather the dough together and fraiser any portions
that were missed.) Form the mass into whatever shape you will be
rolling out (i.e., disk for round, cylinder for rectangle), and wrap
in plastic wrap.  Chill for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.
Dough can be frozen for up to 3 months.
