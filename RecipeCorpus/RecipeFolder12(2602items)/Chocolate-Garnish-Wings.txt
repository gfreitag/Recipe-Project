Title: Chocolate Garnish Wings
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Dark chocolate (can use
Bakers chocolate)
Melt over a double boiler and place into a piping bag or a parchment
cone. On a separate sheet of parchment paper pipe out wings freehand
or draw with a stencil to trace.  Place in freezer so they set up.
Reserve for garnish.

TO ASSEMBLE CAKE

Take cake and cut into two triangles then cut each in half laterally.
On bottom half, ladle berry filling and evenly distribute. Then apply
white chocolate berry sauce.  You can at this point add fresh berry
slices if desired.

Place top half back on top then place cake on a wire rack for glazing.

Using warm ganache ladle glaze on top of cake and allow to run down
sides. If ganache is thin add another coat.

Place in refrigerator until glaze is solid.  Take a whisk and splatter
white chocolate sauce on top and decorate with more berries. With
wings, they can garnish entire cake or you can use smaller wings to
garnish each individual serving.
