Title: Yogurt And Pistachio Cake
Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Raw, unsalted pistachios
1 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
6    Eggs, separated, at room
Temperature
1 1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Yogurt
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Toast pistachios in the oven until crisp
but not brown, about 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, rub
pistachios between your hands or towels to remove the outer skins,
then grind them finely in food processor. Add the flour, soda, and
salt, and process briefly.

Butter and flour a 10-inch springform pan. Increase oven temperature
to 350 degrees.

In a mixer, beat the egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the sugar until pale
yellow and thick ribbons. Mix in the yogurt, then the olive oil. With
a spatula, fold in the reserved flour mixture.

Beat the egg whites to soft peaks, add remaining 3/4 cup sugar and
beat to stiff peaks. Fold egg whites into the batter. Pour batter
into prepared pan and bake 45 to 55 minutes, or until done. Cool on a
rack, remove from pan and serve with drained yogurt, honey and
chopped pistachios.

Yield: 1 (10-inch) cake
