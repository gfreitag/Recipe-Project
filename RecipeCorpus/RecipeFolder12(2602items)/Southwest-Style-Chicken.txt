Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub chickens inside and out with oil,
using 1 tablespoon per chicken.  Insert 3 garlic cloves under skin of
each chicken breast half.  Sprinkle chickens inside and out with

breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan and roast until crisp but
tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Remove from oven, carve thigh and
drumstick intact and slice breast meat. To serve, spoon black bean
sauce on dinner plates and arrange 1 chicken breast and 1
thigh/drumstick on top. Mound guacamole and salsa alongside and top
