Title: Buttermilk Biscuits with Jalapeno Jam
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 3/4 c  Flour
2 tb Baking powder
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  (1 stick)
3/4 c  Buttermilk
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and
salt. Cut in the butter, until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Make a well in the center and pour in the milk all at once. Stir just
until a shaggy dough is formed.

On a lightly floured surface, gently knead the dough 3 or 4 times.
Pat out the dough 1/2inch thickness. With a 3inch round biscuit
cutter or glass dipped in flour, cut out the dough and transfer to a
baking sheet. (You can also cut out squares with a sharp paring
knife.) Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until golden brown and serve hot.

Yield: about 6 3inch biscuits
