Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 lb Ricotta cheese
1/4 lb Smoked ricotta finely
Grated
2    Eggs, beaten
1 ts Salt
2 tb Currants
1/2 ts Bitter chocolate
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Lemon zest, grated
2 tb Sliced scallions
1 tb Finely chopped Italian
Parsley
1 c  Chicken stock
4    Sage leaves
2 tb Butter
Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Make a well with the flour and place ricotta, smoked ricotta, eggs,
salt, currants, chocolate, nutmeg, lemon zest, scallions and parsley
in center. Incorporate everything with your hands to form a dough.
Divide dough into 4 pieces and roll into a dowel or tube about 1-inch
thick. Flatten the tube to about 1/4-inch thick and cut into 1
1/2-inch pieces long. These are called cjarsons. Drop cjarsons into
boiling water and cook until they float, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, place chicken stock, sage and butter into a 12 to 14-inch
saute pan and bring to a boil. Drain cjarsons and toss into pan with
butter mixture. Toss to coat and serve.
