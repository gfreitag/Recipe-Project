Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Unsifted cake flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Unsalted butter, room
Temperature
1 2/3 c  Granulated sugar
5 lg Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
Lemon verbena syrup (recipe
Follows)
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. with rack positioned in the center of
the oven. In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and
set aside. In a mixing bowl with an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle (if available), beat butter until soft and fluffy. Gradually
add sugar and beat until very light and creamy. Add the eggs, one at
a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.
Gradually stir in the flour mixture and blend well. Turn the batter
into Madeleine pans that have been spread with a generous amount of
softened butter and dusted with flour. Use a spatula to scrape the
batter into the pans and level off completely. Clean the edges of the
pan with a paper towel. Bake in oven for about 10 to 15 minutes or
until cake has risen and is golden on top, and a tester inserted in
the center comes out clean. Then slide a knife around the sides to
loosen. Tip out onto rack right side up. Use a thin skewer to prick a
hole in the top of each cake. Pour 1 teaspoon of the warm syrup over
each madeleine and allow it to cool. Place madeleines in an air-tight
container.

Yield: 3 1/2 dozen
