Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
4    Rabbit legs
1/2 c  Walnuts
2    Cloves garlic
1/4 c  Extra virgin oil plus 4
Tablespoons
1 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
Leaves
1 tb Freshly ground pepper
2 md Red onions, cut into 1-inch

1/4    Dried cherries

Remove bones from rabbit legs and butterfly open.

In a food processor, blend together walnuts, garlic, olive oil,
rosemary and pepper until a paste is formed. Divide paste among 4
rabbit legs and roll each leg up. Tie each leg securely with butcher
twine.

In a 10 to 12-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons oil until smoking.
Place rabbit legs in pan and saute on all sides. When fully browned,
add onions, cherries and apricots and saute until softened, about 6
to 7 more minutes. Pour in Prosecco and bring to boil. Lower to a
simmer and cover halfway. Cook 50 to 60 minutes until very tender,
turning occasionally. If liquid dissipates, add 1/4 cup water at a
time. Remove rabbit legs and cut the strings. Place on platter, top
with cherry mixture and serve.
