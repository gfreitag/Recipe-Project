Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2    Sticks unsalted butter,
Softened
1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Grated lemon zest
2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Melted chocolate mixed with
1/2 ts Melted shortening
Plums:
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
6    Fresh plums, quartered
Juice from 1 lemon
1 tb Grated lemon zest
1/2 c  Madeira
2    Scoops vanilla bean ice
Cream
Fresh mint sprigs
Shaker of powdered sugar
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. For the cookies: In an electric
mixer, with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together.
Add the vanilla, cinnamon, and lemon zest. With the mixer on medium,
add the flour, about 1/4 cup at a time. Stop the mixer once or twice
to scrap down the sides of the bowl. Beat until the dough is smooth
and forms a ball around the paddle. Line a cookie sheet with
parchment paper. Roll one tablespoon of the dough into a ball and
place onto the cookie sheet 1-inch apart. Using your fingers, press
down onto the balls to flatten it. Bake for 20 minutes or until
slightly golden around the edges. Drizzle cooled cookies with the
melted chocolate. For the plums: In a saute pan, heat melt the
butter. Stir in the sugar to dissolve. Add the plums, lemon juice,
and zest. Saute the plums until they are completely coated with the
sugar, about 2-3 minutes. Flame the Madeira. Reduce to 1-2 minutes
over high heat. Remove from heat. Place the ice cream in an
over-sized bowl. Pour the plums over the ice cream. Position the
cookies so they are coming out from the ice cream. Garnish with fresh
mint and powdered sugar.
