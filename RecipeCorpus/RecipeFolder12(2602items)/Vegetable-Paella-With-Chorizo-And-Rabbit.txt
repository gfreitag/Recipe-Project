Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
6 c  Chicken stock
1/4 ts Crumbled saffron threads
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Olive oil
1    (2-pound) rabbit, cut into
2    Inch pieces (on the bone)
1/4 lb Sweet chorizo, cut into
1/4    -inch slices
1    Zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch
Cubes
6    Scallions, sliced into
1/2    -inch pieces
8    Mushrooms, quartered
1/2 c  Frozen lima beans
1/2 c  Frozen organic peas
1    Red bell pepper, seeded and

1    Green bell pepper, seeded

1    Carrot, peeled and diced
Salt
2    Tomatoes, seeded and
Chopped
6    Cloves garlic, minced
2 ts Paprika
3 c  Short-grain rice
2 tb Chopped parsley
Combine the stock, saffron, and wine in a saucepan, and bring to a
boil while cooking the meat and vegetables.

Heat the olive oil in a wide paella pan set over two burners. Add the
rabbit pieces and cook until lightly browned all over, about 10
minutes. Transfer rabbit to a plate and keep warm.

Add chorizo to pan and cook about 3 minutes. Add all of the
vegetables, except the tomatoes and garlic, and saute until
vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Stir in the tomatoes, garlic, and paprika, and saute 1 minute to
release the aromas. Add the rice, toss to coat it with the
vegetables, and stir in the parsley.

Preheat an oven to 350degrees F.

Add the hot broth to the pan. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes, or until some
of the liquid reduces. (Paella should have just enough liquid to cook
rice, but not be soupy). Stir in the reserved rabbit pieces, and
adjust seasonings.

Transfer paella pan to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 10 to 12
minutes, or until rice is almost cooked and most of the liquid is
absorbed.

Remove paella from oven, cover loosely, and let sit for 10 minutes
before serving.
