Title: Panned Veal Chop
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Essence
2 c  Flour
2 c  Fine dried bread crumbs
2    Eggs beaten with 2
TB milk
2 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
Using a sharp knife, butterfly each chop. Cover each chop with a large
piece of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet, pound out each chop, about
1/2-inch thick. Season the chops with Essence. In a shallow bowl,
season the flour with Essence. In another shallow bowl, season the
bread crumbs with Essence. Dredge the meat in the flour. Dip each
veal chop in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Dredge each
chop in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating each chop completely. In a
large saute pan or skillet, heat the butter and oil. When the oil is
hot, pan-fry each chop for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove
from the pan and drain the chop on a paper-lined plate. Season the
chops with Essence.
