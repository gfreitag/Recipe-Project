Title: Chocolate Designs And Cake Assembly
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Simple syrup
Kirsch
1 lb Chocolate, chopped
Chocolate Genoise cake
(previous recipe)
Chocolate Buttercream
Frosting (previous recipe)
Combine syrup and Kirsch, to taste, for moistening cake.

In a bowl set over a saucepan of hot but not boiling water, melt
chocolate, stirring frequently. Set aside to cool and thicken to a
pourable consistency. Fill a pastry bag fitted with smallest tip with
chocolate. Pipe out neat small designs onto waxed paper; let solidify
at room temperature.

To assemble cake: slice fully-cooled cake in half horizontally. Using
a pastry brush generously brush both layers with flavored syrup.
Place bottom layer on a cake stand and spread with a nice even layer
of buttercream. Cover with top layer. Using a palette knife spread a
nice, even layer of buttercream on top of cake and then ice sides;
try to make as smooth a surface as you can. Decorate top with
chocolate designs.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings
