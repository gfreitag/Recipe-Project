Title: Chuck Conway's O'bread's Rye Currant Rolls
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Sourdough starter (previous
Recipe)
3 c  Bottled water
Up to 4 1/2 cups flour
2 1/2 c  Stone-ground rye flour
2 tb Coarse salt
2 c  Dried currants
Corn meal
In a large mixing bowl stir together starter and water.  Mix in half
of white flour and half of rye flour, one cup at a time, and salt.
Stir in currants, remaining rye flour and enough of white flour to
make a stiff dough.  When dough is too stiff to stir, turn out onto
work surface. Knead until it comes together in a mass, about 8
minutes; dough will still be slightly sticky.  Transfer to a clean
mixing bowl, cover and set aside until doubled in size.

Turn out dough on lightly-floured work surface and punch down with
floured hands.  Knead briefly and divide in two.  Roll each half into
a log about 3 inches in diameter; cut each into 12 rolls. Using palm
of your hand roll each piece of dough into a small, tight round roll.
Place rolls, about 2 inches apart, on a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet.
Cover and set aside to rise, until barely doubled. Preheat oven to
450 degrees. Bake for 30 minutes.  For crusty rolls, spray walls of
oven with water with a plant mister.

Yield: 2 dozen rolls
