Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Pineapple juice
1/2 c  White wine vinegar
1 ts Ginger, finely chopped
3 tb Soy sauce
3 tb Light brown sugar, firmly
Packed
6 tb Ketchup, prepared or

To prepare the glaze:

Combine the pineapple juice, vinegar, ginger, soy sauce and brown
sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low
and simmer until the volume is reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Add
the ketchup and cook an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the heat
and add the lime juice, and white pepper.

To prepare the burgers:

Shape the ground tuna firmly into 4 round uniform patties about 1
1/2inches thick. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. (The
burgers must be very cold to hold their shape when cooking) Brush
both sides of the burgers lightly with the pineapple glaze and season
with salt and pepper to taste. Heat a large cast iron skillet over
medium high heat until just smoking. Cook the burgers, basting often
with the glaze until cooked to desired doneness.
