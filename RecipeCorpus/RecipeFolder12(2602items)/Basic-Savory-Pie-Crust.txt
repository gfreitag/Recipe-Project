Title: Basic Savory Pie Crust
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3 1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Cold lard or solid vegetable
Shortening
4    To 5 tablespoons ice water
Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the lard and work it in
with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the
water, 1 tablespoon at a time, working it in with your hands. Add
only as much as you need to make a smooth ball of dough. Wrap it in
plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove the
dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured
surface. For 2 crusts, cut the dough in two and put the second half
back in the refrigerator. For each crust, roll the dough out on the
floured surface into a square about 14 inches in diameter and
1/8-inch thick. Gently fold the square of dough in half and then in
half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold
into a square baking pan. Fill and proceed as directed in the recipe.

Yield: 2 pie crusts
