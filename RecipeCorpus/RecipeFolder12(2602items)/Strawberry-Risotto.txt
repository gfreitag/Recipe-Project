Title: Strawberry Risotto
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Milk
2 c  Coconut milk
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Vanilla bean, halved
Lengthwise
2    Strips lemon peel
2 tb Butter
2/3 c  Arborio rice
1/2 c  Heavy cream or creme
Fraiche
1 c  Sliced strawberries
Lightly-toasted sweetened
Flaked coconut, for garnish
Lightly-toasted sliced
Almonds, for garnish
In a saucepan combine milks, sugar, vanilla bean and lemon zest and
heat until very hot and bubbles appear around edges of pan. Reduce
heat and keep warm.

Meanwhile, in another saucepan melt butter. When foaming subsides, add
Arborio rice and stir to coat with butter. Add simmering milk, 1/2
cup at a time, stirring vigorously. Let each addition be absorbed
before adding more. Regulate heat so milk is absorbed at a brisk
simmer. It should take from 30 to 35 minutes to add the liquid. Begin
tasting toward the end of the cooking time -- the rice should be
tender but still firm to the bite. It will form its own sauce.

Stir in cream along with last addition of milk mixture and cook until
partly absorbed. Remove from heat and stir in strawberries, saving a
few perfect slices for garnishing. Serve in shallow bowls, sprinkled
with coconut and almonds.
