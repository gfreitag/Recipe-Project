Title: Chicken Fricassee
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1    (3 to 4 pound) chicken, cut
In 10 pieces (cut each
Breast half in half
Again)
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
2 tb Olive oil
3 tb Butter
3 c  Chicken stock
1/2    -cup onion, finely chopped
2 c  Mushrooms (about 6 ounces),
Chopped
3 tb Flour
1 c  Half and half
1/4    -cup flat leaf parsley,
Minced
Freshly grated nutmeg
Heat oven to 200 degrees F.

Rinse chicken pieces, pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt and
freshly ground black pepper. Heat olive oil and only 1 tablespoon
butter in a large, deep skillet, cast iron preferred. When foam
subsides, add chicken pieces in two batches, starting skin side down
and brown both sides over medium high heat, a total of 10 to 12
minutes. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Return all chicken to
the skillet add stock, bring to a simmer, and cook gently for 25 to
30 minutes until chicken has cooked through. Be sure that the thigh
meat is thoroughly cooked. Remove chicken to a bowl and place in
oven. Strain cooking liquid through 4 layers of cheesecloth. (You can
skip the straining for a less "refined" dish.) Return sauce to
skillet.

While the chicken is cooking, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a
separate skillet. When hot, add the onions and mushrooms and saute
over medium high heat, stirring frequently, until mushrooms release
their liquid, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute,
stirring constantly. Stir in the cream and season liberally with
salt, pepper and freshly grated nutmeg. Whisk this mixture into the
broth in the skillet over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook for 5
to 6 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly (it should be the
consistency of half and half). Arrange chicken on serving plates and
cover with sauce. (This recipe makes 3-1/2 cups of sauce. You will
have leftovers.) Garnish with an abundance of parsley.
