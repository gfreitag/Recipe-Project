Kahlua together. Sift the flour and cocoa together. Using an electric
mixer with a whip attachment, beat the eggs at high speed until the
eggs are frothy. With the eggs are beating, slowly add the sugar.

pale yellow in color and forms a ribbon-like texture. Beat in the
chocolate mixture. Fold in the sifted flour cocoa mixture into the
egg mixture in two batches. Fold in the nuts, espresso powder and
chips. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or
until the center of the cake is done. Do not overbake. Let the
brownies cool. Using a 4-inch round cutter, cut the brownies into 8
circles. Place one brownie circle in the center of the plate. Place a
scoop of ice cream on the brownie. Top with a second circle. Drizzle
with the chocolate sauce. Garish with whipped cream, espresso beans,
espresso powder, powdered sugar and mint.
