Title: Mexican Rice
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Unconverted longgrain rice
8 oz Tomatoes, roughly chopped
With the skin on
1/2 sm Onion, finely chopped
1    Clove garlic, coarsely
Chopped
1/3 c  Vegetable oil, chicken fat,
Or lard
3 1/2 c  Light chicken broth
1/2 md Carrot, cut into 1/4inch
Dice
1/2    Zucchini, cut into 3/8inch
Dice
1/2 c  Chopped poultry hearts and
Gizzards (optional)
3/4 ts Salt
In a large bowl, combine the rice with enough very hot tap water to
cover. Stir and let sit for about 10 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold
water, and drain again, shaking thoroughly. In a blender, combine the
tomatoes, onion, and garlic and blend until smooth, scraping down the
sides of the container as necessary. Set aside.

In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over mediumhigh heat. Add the
rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice turns a light
golden color, about 10 minutes. Do not let it scorch. Add the tomato
puree and fry, scraping the bottom of the pan to stop the mixture
from sticking, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until all the liquid has been
absorbed. Add the chicken broth, carrots, zucchini, and giblets, if
using. Stir in the salt and reduce the heat to mediumlow. Cook the
rice uncovered and undisturbed until almost all of the broth has
evaporated and little air holes form in the surface. Cover the top of
the pan with a towel and the lid, reduce the heat to very low, and
cook for 5 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and let rest
for 10 minutes more, so that the rice can absorb the steam and swell.
Just before serving, turn the rice over from the bottom so that the
juices are redistributed.
