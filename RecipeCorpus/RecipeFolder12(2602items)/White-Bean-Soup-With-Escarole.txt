Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Olive oil
1    Onion, finely chopped
2    Carrots, finely chopped
1    Clove garlic, minced
4 c  Chicken broth
2    (16-ounce) cans white

Heat olive oil in a 4 quart saucepan. Add onion and carrots, cover and
simmer 5 minutes or until tender. If vegetables stick to saucepan,
add some water, cover and continue to simmer.

Add the garlic and saute for a moment. Add 1 of the cans of beans and
mash with a potato masher. Add the other can of beans along with the
broth and bring to a simmer with the sage. Simmer 10 minutes or until
as thick as you like it. If too thick, add more water; if too thin,
boil down until some of the liquid has evaporated.

Stir the escarole or romaine lettuce into the pot, cover and simmer 5
minutes or until lettuce is tender. Uncover, add parsley and adjust
seasoning. Serve with bread and salad for a complete meal.
