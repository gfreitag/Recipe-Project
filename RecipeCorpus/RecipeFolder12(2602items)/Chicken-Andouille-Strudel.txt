Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Diced, cooked chicken
1/4 c  Cooked, crumbled andouille
Sausage
2 tb Chopped green onions, plus
Extra for garnish
1/2 c  Homemade or prepared
Barbecue sauce
Creole spice
2    Sheets phyllo dough
Oil, for drizzling
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine chicken, sausage, green onions
and 2 tablespoons of barbecue sauce, mix well and season with Creole
spice, to taste. Stack phyllo dough sheets on top of each other and
cut into 4 long, even strips. Mound a quarter of chicken filling on
bottom of each strip. Roll up like an eggroll, tucking in sides to
prevent filling from leaking. Transfer rolls to a baking sheet,
drizzle with a little oil and sprinkle with Creole spice. Bake 12
minutes until lightly-browned and crispy. Heat remaining barbecue
sauce, spoon onto 4 plates and top with chicken roll. Sprinkle with
green onions and Parmesan cheese, to garnish.
