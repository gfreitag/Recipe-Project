Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/2    Recipe Flaky Pie Dough
3 tb Light molasses
1/3 c  Firmly packed light brown
Sugar
3 tb All-purpose flour
8    Golden delicious apples,
Peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 c  Dried cranberries
2 ts Grated lemon peel
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Grated gingerroot
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground clove
3 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
Into bits
2 tb Heavy cream
2 tb Cinnamon sugar
Heavy cream as an
Accompaniment
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Make pastry and chill 30 minutes.

In large heavy saucepan combine molasses, sugar, flour, apples,
cranberries, spices, lemon peel and 3 tablespoons of butter. Bring to
boil and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until apples
are softened. Transfer to a 2-quart baking dish and dot with butter.

On a lightly floured surface roll out pastry into a round about
1/8-inch thick and trim it so that it will just fit inside the baking
dish. Cover fruit with pastry, brush with cream and sprinkle with
sugar. With the point of a small sharp knife cut three steam vents in
the center of the crust. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden
brown.

Remove baking dish from oven and with a sharp knife cut the crust and
fruit into 2-inch pieces, pushing crust into fruit with back of a
spatula so that juices bubble up over top of crust. Bake 15 minutes
more.

Serve warm with cream.
