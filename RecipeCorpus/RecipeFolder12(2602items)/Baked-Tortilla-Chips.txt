Title: Baked Tortilla Chips
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Salt
1 ts Cayenne
Juice of 1 lime
2 c  Water
2 tb Vegetable oil
12    Stale corn tortillas
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a medium saucepan, mix the brine
ingredients, warm over a low heat and whisk thoroughly. Cut the stale
tortillas into strips or wedges. (If the tortillas are fresh, dry
them by spreading them on a baking sheet and letting them sit out,
room temperature, for 1 hour or more.) Briefly dip the tortilla
pieces into the brine, then shake off the excess water. (A longer
soaking in the brine will make the tortillas take on a more
pronounced flavor.) Spread the prepared tortilla chips in a single
layer on a baking sheet. Bake, turning occasionally, until they are
crisp and golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.
