1 lb Granulated sugar
2 1/2 pt Water
1    Vanilla pod
1 lb Raspberries
7 oz Caster sugar
Put the granulated sugar into a saucepan large enough to hold the
peaches. Add the water and the vanilla pod and bring to the boil,
gently to begin with, stirring until the sugar dissolves. When
simmering put in the peaches. Bring back to simmering point and very
gently poach for 8 minutes. Remove the peaches and peel while still

the peaches in a beautiful glass dish and chill.

Liquidise the raspberries with the caster sugar and pass through a
sieve if you wish to get rid of the pips. When ready to eat, pour the
red puree over the succulent peaches. Decorate with mint leaves
dragged through icing sugar.
