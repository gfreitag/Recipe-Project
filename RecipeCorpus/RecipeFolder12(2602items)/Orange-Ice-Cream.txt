orange zest and bring to a boil over mediumhigh heat. Remove from the
heat.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks and sugar and whisk
until the mixture is pale yellow and thickened. Whisking all the
time, pour in the hot cream mixture. Whisk until well combined and
then stir in the citrus juices and vanilla. Strain into a large, flat
container and chill until cold. Freeze in an ice cream maker
according to the manufacturers

instructions. Store in the freezer for up to 2 days, if desired.
