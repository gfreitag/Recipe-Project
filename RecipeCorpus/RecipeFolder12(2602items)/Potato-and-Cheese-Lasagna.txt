Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Oil bottom of an 8x10-inch baking dish.
Using a vegetable slicer or very sharp knife, slice sweet potatoes as
thin as possible.  Slice baking and red skin potatoes as you need
them, to prevent browning.  Cover bottom of dish with a layer of
Idaho potato slices, slightly overlapping.  Drizzle with oil,
sprinkle with garlic and cheeses and season with salt and pepper. Top
with sweet potatoes, then red skin potatoes, seasoning and sprinkling
each layer. Continue layers until all potatoes are used up, reserving
enough cheese to fully cover top layer. Cover with foil and bake
until potatoes are fork tender. Remove and let sit before cutting.
