Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Olive oil
1 c  Flour
4 ea Beef shanks, about 6 ounces
Each
Salt and black pepper
2 c  Medium diced onions
1 c  Medium diced celery
1 c  Medium diced carrots
2 tb Chopped garlic
3    Bay leaves
2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
1 c  Red wine
2 qt Veal or dark stock
1/4 c  Parsley
4 lg Parsnips, top skin removed
And peeled into thin strips
Preheat the fryer. In a large stock pot or braising pot, add the
olive oil. Season the shanks with salt and pepper. Season the flour
with Essence. Dredge the shanks in the seasoned flour, coating each
side completely. When the oil is hot, sear the shanks for 2 to 3
minutes on each side, or until very brown on all sides. Remove the
shanks and set aside. Add the onions to the pan and saute for 2
minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the celery and carrots and
continue to saute for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in
the garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan
with the red wine, scraping the bottom and sides to loosen the
browned particles. Add the stock. Bring the liquid up to a boil and
reduce to a simmer. Add the shanks and continue to cook for about 2
hours, basting the shanks often, or until the sauce is stew-like and
the meat starts to fall of the bone. Season with salt and pepper if
needed. Place the parsnips in the fryer and fry until golden about 1
to 2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the parsnips from
sticking together. Remove the parsnips from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season the parsnips with salt and pepper. To
serve, mound the pudding in the center of the plate. Lay a few of the
shanks on top of the potatoes and spoon some of the gravy over the
top. Sprinkle with parsley and garnish with the fried parsnips.
