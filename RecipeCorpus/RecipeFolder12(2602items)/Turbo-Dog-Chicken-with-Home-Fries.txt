Title: Turbo Dog Chicken with Home Fries
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Bacon, diced
2 c  Julienne onions
1 1/2 lb New potatoes, quartered
Vegetable oil for frying
4    (6-ounce) chicken breast,
Cut into strips
Essence
1 1/2 c  Flour, sifted
1 tb Sugar
4 tb Turbo Dog Beer
2    Egg yolks, beaten
6 tb Milk
6 tb Water
Salt and pepper
2    Egg whites, beaten to stiff
Peaks
Remoulade sauce
Preheat the oil.  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Place the
potatoes in the boiling water and blanch for 6 minutes.  Drain the
potatoes and set aside.  In a cast iron skillet, render the bacon
over medium-high heat, until crispy, about 8 minutes.  Add the onions
and potatoes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Pan-fry the
potatoes for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the
potatoes are tender and lightly caramelized.  Set the potatoes aside
and keep warm. Season the chicken with Essence.  In a mixing bowl,
combine the flour and sugar together. Whisk in the beer, egg yolks,
milk and water. Whisk until smooth. Season the batter with salt and
pepper.  Cover the batter and let rest for 30 minutes. Uncover the
batter and fold in the beaten egg whites.  Dip the chicken strips in
the batter, letting the excess drip off. Carefully lay the chicken in
the oil and fry for 4 to 6 minutes or until the chicken is golden
brown.  Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on paper-lined
plate.  Season the chicken with Essence. Serve the chicken with the
Remoulade sauce and the home fries. Yield: 4 servings
