Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large saute pan, melt 4
tablespoons of butter.

Add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves and is bubbly.
Add the pecans.

Season the pecans with salt, cayenne, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Continue
to cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar starts to caramelize
and coat the pecans evenly. Cook for about 4 minutes. Remove the pan
from the heat and spread the pecans over a parchment lined baking
sheet. Place the pan in the oven and roast the pecans for about 6
minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and cool completely. Break the
pecans into small pieces. Fill three small saucepans half way up the
pan with water. Place the pans over medium heat and bring to a boil
and then reduce to a simmer. In three separate mixing bowls, add each
type of chips into the individual bowls. Place the bowls over the
saucepans. After about 2 minutes over the heat the chocolate will
start to melt. Stir each chocolate until totally melted. Remove the
chocolate from heat and stir 1 tablespoon of butter into each bowl of
chocolate. Pour each type of chocolate over the marble or a large
parchment lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the pecans and cherries over
the chocolates. Using a metal spatula, spread the mixture out evenly
back and forth to about 1/4-inch thick. Either place the marble in
the refrigerator or allow to sit out until set, about a couple of
hours. Break the bark into medium pieces and serve. Yield: 4 pounds
of bark
