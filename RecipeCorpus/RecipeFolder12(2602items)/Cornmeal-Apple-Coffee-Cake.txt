Title: Cornmeal Apple Coffee Cake
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
2/3 c  Stoneground cornmeal
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
pn Salt
1/2 c  Plain yogurt
1/4 c  Whole milk
2 lg Eggs plus 1 egg white
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 lg Apples, peeled, cored and
Diced
1 ts Cinnamon
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9 inch round cake pan
and set aside.

Place the flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda
and salt in a large bowl and mix to combine. In a small bowl, combine
the yogurt and milk, and whisk in the eggs, egg white and oil and set
aside.

Toss the apples with the cinnamon. Add to the dry ingredients and
toss to coat the fruit. Add the yogurt mixture and, using a rubber
spatula, mix until just combined. The mixture will be lumpy, but
should not be overmixed. Pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan,
spreading it out to the edges.

Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pan on the
rack. When cool, invert the cake onto a cutting board and slice into
8 wedges. Split each wedge in half and toast under a broiler, cut
side up. Serve warm.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
