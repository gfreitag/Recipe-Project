Title: Naranjas En Dulce
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6    Oranges
3    Limes
2    Grapefruit
1 tb Salt
3 qt Orange juice, or as needed
1 1/2 qt Water
3 c  Sugar
2    Cinnamon sticks
Fresh fromage blanc or
Farmers cheese, for serving
1 ts Ground cinnamon, for
Garnish
With a sharp knife, remove the zest from the all the fruits, leaving
the white pith. Freeze the zest for another use. Cut the fruit into
quarters and gently squeeze the juice out of them into a bowl. Strain
out the seeds and reserve the juice. Cut all the fruit into 3/4inch
lengthwise strips.

In a large saucepan, combine the citrus strips with the salt and a
generous amount of water. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat
so that the liquid is simmering. Cook for 25 minutes, then drain.
Cover the fruit slices with fresh water and soak for 4 hours,
changing the water every hour.

Measure the reserved fruit juice and add enough extra juice to make
the amount up to 4 quarts. In a large, nonreactive stock pot, combine
the water, fruit juice, sugar, and cinnamon sticks. Stir the mixture
over low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer until the
liquid has reduced by just over half, to 2 quarts (this will take 3
1/2 to 4 hours, and the liquid will be dark brown). Add the fruits to
the mixture and continue simmering for about 1 hour, stirring
occasionally, until the fruit has absorbed some of the syrup and are
golden. Remove from the heat and allow to cool until just warmer than
room temperature (if allowed to go cold the mixture will get too
thick). Spoon some of the fruits, with their syrup, into bowls and
garnish with a scoop of fromage blanc and a drift of ground cinnamon.
