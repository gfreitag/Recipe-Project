Title: Lobster and Chips
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Live lobster, about 2 to 3
Lb
1 sm Box Ritz crackers, about 4
Oz
1/4 c  Drawn butter
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
Salt and pepper
1 lb Steak fries
Vegetable oil for frying
1    Paper bag
Malt vinegar, to taster
2    Fresh lemons, split in half
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Preheat the vegetable oil for
frying a large skillet. Begin by splitting the lobster, turn the
lobster on its back, with one hand hold down the claws. Place the top
of the knife at the tip of the head of the lobster. Push the blade
down through the lobsters body and cut it in half lengthwise. Remove
the brains, liver, and coral. Using the back of your knife, crack the
claws in several places. (This will allow for easy removal of the
meat after cooking.) Place the lobster, shell side down, on a baking
sheet. In a small mixing bowl, combine the crackers, butter, parsley,
and lemon juice. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Season the
inside of the lobster with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity of the
lobster with this filling and cover the tail meat with the excess.
Bake for 25 minutes or until the meat is white and the crust is
golden brown. Place the steak fries in the hot oil and fry until
golden brown and crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oil
and drain on a paper-lined plate. Place the fries in the paper bag
with salt, pepper and a sprinkling of vinegar. Shake the bag a couple
of times to season the fries completely. Serve the fries with the
baked lobster.
