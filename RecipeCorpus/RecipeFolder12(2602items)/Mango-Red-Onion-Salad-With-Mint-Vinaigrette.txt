Title: Mango Red Onion Salad With Mint Vinaigrette
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2    Florida mangos
1    Red Bermuda onion
3 tb Warm honey
3 tb Lime juice
2 tb Fresh chopped mint leaves
1 tb Soy sauce
Cut the mangos in half, using the tip of your knife to cut around the
large seed in the center.  With the knife tip make slashes in the
pulp of the fruit but not through the skin.  Cut again in the

other direction so that you've made hash marks in the fruit.  Now
turn the skin of the fruit inside out so that the fruit projects
outward. With a spoon scoop out the already cut fruit into a mixing
bowl. Peel the onion, cut in two and slice from root end to stem end
into a fine julienne. Mix the mango and onion together. Combine the
honey, lime juice, mint and soy in a small bowl.  Pour this
vinaigrette over the mango and onion and serve.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
