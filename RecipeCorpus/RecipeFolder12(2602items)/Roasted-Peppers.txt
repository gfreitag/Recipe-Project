Title: Roasted Peppers
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
6    Red bell peppers
1/2 c  Fine quality olive oil
3 tb Golden raisins
2 tb Pine nuts
1 ts Chopped Italian parsley
1/8 ts Minced garlic, optional
Salt and peppers to taste
Preheat broiler. Broil the peppers, turning frequently, until skin has
blackened on all sides. Remove from broiler and immediately put into a
large brown paper bag. Seal tightly. Allow peppers to steam in the
sealed bag for about 20 minutes or until cool enough to handle. When
peppers are cool, remove from bag. Remove the blackened skin, stems
and seeds, and cut the peppers, lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick strips.

Let strips stand in a colander for at least 3 hours or until most of
the moisture has drained off. Combine peppers with oil, raisins,
nuts, parsley and if using, garlic. Season to taste with salt and
pepper and stir. Allow to marinate for at least 1 hour before serving
at room temperature.
