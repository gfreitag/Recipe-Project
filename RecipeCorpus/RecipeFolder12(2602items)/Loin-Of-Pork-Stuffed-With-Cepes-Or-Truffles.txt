Title: Loin Of Pork Stuffed With Cepes Or Truffles
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4 lb Loin of pork
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
3    Truffles or 2 ounces dried
Cepes (porcinis)
Cloves of garlic, thinly
Sliced
3/4 pt Hot meat stock or water
1/4 pt White wine
Ask your butcher to bone the loin and remove the rind, but keep both
bones and the rind for the cooking.  If you are using dried cepes,
cover them with warm water and leave to soak for 30 minutes or until
they are soft. Drain, reserving the liquid.  Lay the meat on a board
and season well with salt and pepper.  Cut the truffles or cepes into
little pieces and lay at intervals along the meat interspersed with
slivers of garlic. Roll the meat up and tie it with string into a
long bolster shape. Place it in a roasting pan surrounded by the
bones and the rind cut into strips. Roast in a preheated oven at 325
degrees for 30 minutes.  Pour in the hot stock or water, the wine,
and the liquid from the cepes.  Cover and cook for a further 2 to 2
1/2 hours.  Remove the pork and keep hot. Strain the juices and
reduce, then season to taste.  Serve with the sliced pork. Or, if
serving the pork cold, pour off the juices into a bowl and chill.
Remove the fat, but keep it for frying bread or little potatoes--it
has a splendid flavor.  The juices will have jellied and should be
chopped and arranged around the cold pork in a serving dish. Serve
with what you will, such as a fine salad and some sauteed potatoes.
