Title: Chipotle Grilled Shrimp
Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb (about 4042) large shrimp,
Shelled and deveined
1 sm Can chipotle chiles in adobo
Stemmed and wiped clean
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Place shrimp in large bowl. Place chiles in a blender or food
processor fitted with the metal blade and puree. With the motor
running, drizzle in oil until creamy emulsion is formed. Pour over
shrimp in bowl and mix thoroughly to coat shrimp. Cover bowl and
refrigerate for 12 hours. Soak 12 bamboo skewers in water 30 minutes.
Preheat grill to moderately high.

Lay 67 shrimp on board in front of you, nestled together and flat,
with tails all facing one direction and heads the other. Holding
shrimp flat with the palm of one hand, insert one bamboo skewer one
third of the way from one end. Insert another skewer parallel to the
first, one third of the way from the other end, so as to create a
flat panel of shrimp that can be turned easily. Repeat with remaining
shrimp and skewers to form 6 skewers in all. Season each side of
shrimp with pepper (the marinade is already salted). Brush grill well
and wipe with oiled paper towel. Place shrimp skewers and grill 12
minutes per side until done. The center shrimp should be just opaque.
Remove from grill and serve.
