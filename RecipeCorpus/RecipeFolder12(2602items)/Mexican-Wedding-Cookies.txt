Categories: Toohot, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Soft unsalted butter
1 c  Powdered sugar
2 tb Vanilla
1 ts Salt
2 c  Finely chopped pecans
5 c  Sifted pastry flour
Powdered sugar for dusting
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Beat butter and powdered sugar in mixer
until light and fluffy, about 1015 minutes. Add vanilla, salt and
pecans. Remove from mixer and stir in pastry flour by hand being
careful not to overmix. Form into football shapes about the size of
small walnuts and place on a buttered cookie sheet. Bake 1012 minutes
or until just beginning to get the slightest bit colored on the
bottom. Remove upon the first sign of color and set on a rack to
cool. When cool enough to touch place in a bowl with powdered sugar
on top and bottom and toss gently. Occasionally toss with sugar while
cooling, trying to get as much sugar as possible to stick. When cold,
place cookies in airtight container and cover until ready to serve.

Yield: 50 cookies
