Categories:
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------MOLTO MARIO #MB5739-------------------------
2 1/4 c  Flour
1/2 c  Cocoa powder
1 2/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
3 lg Eggs
3 lg Egg yolks
1 tb Almond extract
3/4 c  Hazelnuts, skin on
1/2 c  Mini chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 350 F. In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, cocoa,
sugar and baking powder. In a separate bowl whisk together the eggs,
yolks and almond extract. Add wet mix to dry and stir until the dough
comes together, about 2 minutes. Add hazelnuts and chocolate chips
and mix until just incorporated. Roll the dough into 3 logs each
about 10 by 2 inches. Place a piece of parchment onto a baking sheet
and place logs on sheet. Place in oven and bake 20 minutes until
light golden brown and remove. Allow to cool 5 minutes and cut logs
on a slight diagonal into pieces 1/2-inch thick. Lower heat to 300.
Return cut biscotti to baking sheet, just a little bit apart from
each other, and place in oven. Bake 20 minutes until crisp and dry.
Cool and serve.
