Title: Chocolate Chocolate Chunk Scones
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 3/4 c  All purpose bleached flour
1/3 c  Non-alkalized cocoa powder,
Sifted
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Unsalted butter
6 oz Coarsely chopped bittersweet
Or semisweet chocolate, or
6    Ounce
pk Chocolate chips
1    Egg
3/4 c  Buttermilk, or milk
Cover a cookie sheet pan with parchment or foil. Preheat oven to 450
degrees and set rack in the middle level.

Combine flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
bowl. Cut butter into 12 pieces and rub evenly into dry ingredients,
until mixture has the appearance of fine cornmeal. Add chopped
chocolate or chips.

Whisk egg and buttermilk together and stir into flour and butter
mixture with a fork, to form a smooth dough. Divide the dough into 3
pieces and form into 5-inch disks. Using a sharp, floured knife,
divide each disk into four wedges. Place on pan 2 inches apart in all
directions.

Bake scones for 10 to 15 minutes, being careful that they do not
color too deeply, or until they are firm, but not dry.

Yield: 12 scones
