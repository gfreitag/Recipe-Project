Title: Almond Butter Disks
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1    Stick butter
1/2 c  Sugar
Grated zest of 1 lemon
1 tb Dark rum
2    Egg whites
1 c  Ground almonds
6 tb Flour
Glaze:
2/3 c  Seedless raspberry preserves
1 tb Kirsch
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cream the softened butter and add the sugar in a stream.  Continue
beating until the butter/sugar whitens.  Beat in the zest and rum,
then the egg whites, one at a time, beating smooth between each
addition. Mix the almonds and flour together and stir them into the
batter by hand.

Pipe the batter on paper lined pans in 1-inch mounds using a 1/2-inch
plain tube.  Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes.

For the glaze:

Bring the preserves and the Kirsch to a boil in a small pan over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.  Apply
glaze while it is still very hot.

Cool the cookies on the paper and sandwich them with raspberry glaze
after they have cooled.
