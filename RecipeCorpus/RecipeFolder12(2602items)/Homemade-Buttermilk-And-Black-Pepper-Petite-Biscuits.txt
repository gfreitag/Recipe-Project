Title: Homemade Buttermilk And Black Pepper Petite Biscuits
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Cracked black pepper
2 tb Vegetable shortening
1/4 c  Plus 1 teaspoon buttermilk
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, combine the dry
ingredients and blend thoroughly. Cream in the shortening with your
fingers or a fork, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the
buttermilk a little at a time and, using your hands or a fork, work
it in just until it's thoroughly incorporated and you have a smooth
ball of dough. Do not overwork or overhandle the dough. On a lightly
floured surface, roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a circle
about 1/2-inch thick. Using a small round cookie cutter or the rim of
a shot glass, press out twelve 1-inch rounds. Place the biscuits on a
baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Yield: 1 dozen biscuits
