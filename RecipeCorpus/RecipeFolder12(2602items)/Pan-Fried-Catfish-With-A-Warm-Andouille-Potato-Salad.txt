Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    To 1 1/2 cups of vegetable
Oil for frying
1/2 lb Andouille bulk sausage
2 c  Julienne onions
Salt and black pepper
2 tb Minced shallots
1 tb Minced garlic
1 1/2 lb New potatoes, quartered and
Blanched
4    (6-ounce) catfish fillets
1 c  Flour
Essence
1/2 c  Corn and jalapeno tartar
Sauce
1 tb Chopped chives
1 tb Brunoise red peppers

In a cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil. In a hot large sauté
pan, render the sausage for 2-3 minutes. Add the onions and continue
sautéing for 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the shallots
and garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Stir in the potatoes and sauté for
2-3 minutes or until the potatoes are heated through completely.
Season the salad with salt and pepper. Season the catfish fillets and
flour with Essence. Dredge the fillets in the flour, removing any
excess. Lay the fillets in the hot oil. Pan-fry the fillets for 3-4
minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Remove from the oil and
drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fish with Essence. Mound the
potato salad in the center of a plate. Lay the fish directly on top
of the fish. Garnish with the tartar sauce, chives, and peppers.
