Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4    (3 to 4-ounce) hamburger
Patties, about 1/2-inch
Thick
Salt and pepper
1 sm Onion, julienned
4    (1-ounce) slices of Cheddar
Cheese
1 tb Vegetable oil
8 sl Rye bread
1 1/2 c  Flour
2    Egg yolks
3/4    To 1 cup flat beer
2    Onions, cut into 1-inch
Rings and separated
Oil for frying
Preheat the griddle. Preheat the fryer. Season the patties with salt
and pepper. Place the patties on the hot griddle and cook for 3 to 4
minutes, flip the patties over and continue to cook. Add the onions
to the griddle and saute for 4 to 5 minutes or until wilted. Season
the onions with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl, whisk the flour,
eggs and beer together. Season the batter with salt and pepper.
Season the onions with salt and pepper. Dip each onion ring in the
batter, coating completely and letting the excess drip off. Carefully
lay the onion rings in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 3 to 4
minutes, stirring occasionally for over-all browning. Remove the
onions rings from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season
the rings with salt and pepper. During the last couple of minutes of
cooking, place one piece of cheese on each patty. After the cheese
has melted remove the patties from the griddle and set aside. Top
each patty with the sauteed onions. Oil both sides of the bread and
place on the griddle. Cook the bread for 1 to 2 minutes on each side
or until toasted. Remove the bread from the griddle and place
in-between each patty. Serve the patty melts with the onions rings.
