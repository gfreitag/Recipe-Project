Title: Bearnaise Sauce
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  White wine vinegar
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Minced shallots
1 tb Minced fresh tarragon
Salt and pepper
3    Egg yolks
2 tb Cold unsalted butter
1/2    To 2/3 cup melted unsalted
Butter
2 tb Minced fresh parsley or
Tarragon
In a small saucepan combine vinegar, wine, shallots, and tarragon and
simmer over moderately heat until reduced to 2 tablespoons of liquid.
Cool and strain through a fine sieve.

In the top of double boiler or a heat-proof bowl whisk the egg yolks
until they become thick and sticky.  Whisk in the reduced vinegar
mixture, salt and pepper.  Add 1 tablespoon of the cold butter. Place
the pan or bowl over a saucepan of simmering, not boiling, water.
Whisk until mixture is warm, about 2 minutes.  (If mixture appears to
become lumpy dip pan immediately in a bowl of ice water to cool,
whisk until smooth and then continue recipe.)  The yolk mixture has
thickened enough when you can see the bottom of the pan between
strokes and mixture forms a light cream on the wires of the whip.

Immediately remove from pan or bowl from heat and whisk in 1
tablespoon of the remaining cold butter to cool the yolk mixture and
stop the cooking.

While whisking the yolk mixture gradually pour in the melted butter, a
tablespoon or so at a time whisking thoroughly to incorporate before
adding more butter.  As the mixture begins to thicken and become
creamy, the butter can be added more rapidly.  Do not add the milk
solids at the bottom of the melted butter.

Season the sauce to taste with chopped herbs, salt and pepper. To
keep the sauce warm, set the pan or bowl in lukewarm water or in a
thermos.

Yield:  1 to 1 1/2 cups sauce
