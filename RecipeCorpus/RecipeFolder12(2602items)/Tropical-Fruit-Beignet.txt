1/2    Cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon small diced papayas 3 tablespoons small diced mango 3

Preheat the fryer. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking

the small diced fruit. Refrigerate for 1 hour. In a sauce pot,
combine the chopped mango, lemon juice, water and sugar together.
Bring the mixture up to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 5
minutes or until the fruit is very tender. Pour the mixture into a
food processor and puree until smooth. Remove and allow to chill for
30 minutes. In the hot grease, drop a heaping tablespoon of the
beignet. Fry 5-6 at a time and stir constantly for even browning. Fry
the beignets for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the
fryer and drain on a paper-lined plate. Powder the beignets with
powdered sugar. Spoon the coulis in the center of the plate. Place
the quenelle of ice cream in the center of the coulis. Arrange the
beignets around the ice cream. Garnish with powdered sugar and
chiffonade of mint.
