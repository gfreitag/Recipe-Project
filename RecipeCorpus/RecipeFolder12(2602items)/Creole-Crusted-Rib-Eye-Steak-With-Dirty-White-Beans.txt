Follows
1 lb Navy white beans
10 c  Beef stock
6 oz Foie gras, cleaned and small

1/4 c  Chopped green onions

Preheat the oven to 400 degree F. In a large saucepan, render the
bacon until crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add the onions. Season with
salt and pepper. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the celery, tomatoes
and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Add the ham hocks and
confit. Stir in the beans and stock. Bring the liquid to a boil and
reduce to a simmer. Cook until the beans are tender, about 2 to 2 1/2
hours. In a hot saute pan, sear the foie gras for 1 minute. Remove
from the heat and turn into the bean mixture, including the foie gras
fat. Mix thoroughly. Stir in the green onions. Season the steaks with
a olive oil, salt and pepper. In a hot saute pan, sear the steaks for
3 minutes on each side. Remove and cool completely. Smear each steak
completely with the mustard. In a small mixing bowl, season the bread
crumbs with Essence. Add the olive oil and mix. Dredge the steaks in
the seasoned bread crumbs, coating all sides completely. Place the
steaks on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Roast the
steaks for 15 minutes or until the steaks are medium rare.

To serve, spoon the bean mixture in the center of the plate. Lay the
steaks on top of the beans and serve with fried parsnips. Yield: 4
servings
