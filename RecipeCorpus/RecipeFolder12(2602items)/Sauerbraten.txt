and 4 1/2 cups of liquid. Pour the liquid over the meat. It should be
completely covered with liquid. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3
days, rotating every
12    hours or so.

Remove the meat from the brine and pat dry. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil
in a dutch oven. Sear the meat on all sides and ends until very dark
brown, remove the meat. Add the onions, cook for 2 to 3 minutes, add
the tomato paste, and cook, stirring for 2 minutes. Strain the brine
and add it to the dutch oven. Add the meat, and stock. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours or until fork
tender, rotating occasionally. Remove the meat, whisk in the cookie
crumbs. Puree with a hand held blender until smooth. Season. Thinly
slice the meat against the grain. Top with the gravy. Garnish with
chopped parsley.
