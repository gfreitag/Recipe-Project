Title: Tortilla De Patata
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Russet potatoes, peeled
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 lg Onions, thinly sliced
6 lg Eggs
Halve the potatoes lengthwise and, with a sharp knife or, preferably,
a mandoline, slice them crosswise about 1/16inch thick. Toss the
potatoes with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and half of the pepper. In
9inch castiron skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil over medium
heat. Add the potatoes and cook, tossing occasionally with a spatula,
until golden and crisp. Try to avoid clumping but, if they stick
together a bit don't worry. Set the pan aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in another skillet over
medium-low heat and saute the onions, stirring occasionally, for
about 20 minutes, or until very soft and slightly golden.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, beat the eggs
together and stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and
pepper, and the onions. Remove the potatoes from the pan with a
slotted spoon and let them drain for a moment in a colander. Wipe the
potatocooking pan with a paper towel, then add the remaining 2
tablespoons oil to the skillet. Heat the skillet over low heat, stir
the potatoes into the egg mixture, and immediately pour it into the
hot skillet. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the bottom of the
cake is slightly golden. Place a large plate upside down on top of
the skillet, invert it, and turn the cake onto the plate. Slide the
cake back into the pan. Finish cooking in the oven for 4 to 5 more
minutes, or until the eggs are set. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes,
then cut into wedges or squares, depending on the number of people
you want to serve. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Yield: 6 to 10 servings

Variation: Add 2 roasted, peeled, and diced red peppers and 1
tablespoon of paprika to the onion mixture after it is cooked.
