Title: Classic Chocolate Truffles
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1    Vanilla bean, halved
pn Salt
9 oz Bittersweet chocolate, cut
Into 1-inch pieces
1 1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
In a saucepan heat heavy cream, vanilla bean and salt and bring to a
gentle boil. Meanwhile, in bowl of an electric mixer set over a pan
of simmering water melt chocolate, stirring often, until smooth.
Remove chocolate from heat. Strain cream mixture through a fine sieve
into chocolate. (Rinse vanilla beans, dry them and reserve for
vanilla sugar or another use.) Replace bowl in electric mixer and
whip chocolate ganache mixture until cool and light in color. Cover
and chill.

When ganache is firm, spoon up about 1 tablespoon. Place cocoa in a
shallow plate and use to dust palms. Lightly and quickly roll
chocolate mixture between palms to form irregularly-shaped balls.
Dredge truffles in cocoa until well-coated. Set on a foil-lined
baking sheet while you continue to make truffles with remaining
ganache. Best when served within 24 hours, or store in a cool place
up to 3 days.

Yield: about 2 1/2 Dozen
