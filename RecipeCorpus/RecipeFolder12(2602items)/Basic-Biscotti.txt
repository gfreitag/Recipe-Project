Title: Basic Biscotti
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6 lg Eggs
2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Salt
4 c  All purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
For Hazelnut: 2 cups roughly chopped, sliced, or whole hazelnuts

For Lemon/Poppy: grated rind of three lemons, 1 teaspoon poppy seeds

For Ginger: 1 1/2 cups chopped crystallized (candied) ginger

Preheat oven to 350. Beat eggs and add sugar to blend. Add salt. Sift
flour and baking powder and add all at once to eggs. Stir just to
blend. Add flavoring or garnish. Spoon mixture lengthwise onto cookie
sheet lined with parchment paper or greased. Spoon into a "log",
shape as wide as you choose, the width of the "log" will determine
the length of the cut biscotti. Make as many "logs" as you have mix.
Allow logs to sit for about 10 minutes at room temperature before
baking. Bake at 350 for approximately 20 minutes or until center of
log springs back when touched. Remove from oven and let cool
thoroughly. Cut logs into strips crosswise. Standard is about 1/2
inch. Place each biscotti cut side down onto cookie sheet lined with
parchment or lightly greased. Bake again for approximately 15 minutes
or until lightly browned on edges. Cool thoroughly, then store in
airtight container.
