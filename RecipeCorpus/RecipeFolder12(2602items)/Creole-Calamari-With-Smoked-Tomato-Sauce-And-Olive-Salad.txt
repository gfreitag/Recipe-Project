2 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Black olives, sliced

2 oz Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

In a mixing bowl, toss the tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of the olive
oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes on the smoker
rack and smoke for 15 minutes. Remove from the smoker and place both
the tomatoes and tomato juice in a medium saucepan. Add the chicken
stock. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 30
minutes. Using a hand-held blender, puree the sauce until smooth.
Strain and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. In a mixing bowl,
combine the olives, shallots, garlic, celery, parsley, black pepper
and the 1/2 cup of the olive oil. Mix well. In a mixing bowl,
marinate the cut calamari in the buttermilk with 2 tablespoons
Essence, allow to sit for 20 minutes. Combine the masa and flours
together with the remaining Essence. For olive salad, combine all the
ingredients together and set aside. Dredge the marinated calamari in
the flour mixture and sift to remove any excess. Place dredged
calamari in the fryer basket and deep fry until slightly golden in
color, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir constantly to prevent from sticking
together. Remove from the fryer and drain on a paper-lined plate.
Season with Essence. To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of a
large platter. Place the calamari on top of the sauce. Mound the
olive salad on top of the calamari. Garnish with the cheese.
