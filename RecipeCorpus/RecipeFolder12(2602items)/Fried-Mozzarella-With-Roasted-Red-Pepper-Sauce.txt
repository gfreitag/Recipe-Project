Desired
In a small shallow bowl stir together the bread crumbs, the pine
nuts, and salt and pepper to taste.  Have ready in 2 separate bowls
the flour and the egg, beaten lightly.  Working with 1 mozzarella
slice at a time, dredge the slices in the flour, shaking off the
excess, dip them in the egg, letting the excess drip off, and coat
them with the crumb mixture, patting the crumbs gently onto the sides
and edges. Line a plate with waxed paper and chill the slices in one
layer on it for 15 minutes. While the mozzarella is chilling, in a
blender blend the peppers, 1 tablespoon of the oil, the lemon juice,
the vinegar, the cayenne, 1 tablespoon water, and salt and pepper to
taste until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the sauce to a bowl, stir
in the olives and 2 tablespoons of the parsley, and divide the sauce
between 2 plates.  In a large heavy skillet, preferably nonstick,
heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until
it is hot but not smoking and in it saute the mozzarella slices,
turning them once, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are golden.
Divide the mozzarella slices between the plates and garnish them with
the additional parsley.
