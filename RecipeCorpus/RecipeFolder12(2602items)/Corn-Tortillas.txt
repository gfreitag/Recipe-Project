Title: Corn Tortillas
Categories: Hot
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Finely ground deep yellow
Masa harina
2 3/4 c  Cold water
1 ts Sea salt
In a large mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, water, and salt. Stir
until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when
pressed together. To test, flatten a small ball of dough between your
palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a
time, until a test piece does not crack.

Divide the dough into 24 golf ballsize pieces for tacos, or 12 large
balls for quesadillas. Place on a platter and cover with a damp towel.

Line a tortilla press with 2 sheets of plastic cut from a plastic
freezer bag or other heavy duty plastic bag.

Heat a comal until moderately hot.

Flatten each ball of dough in the tortilla press. Remove the top
sheet of plastic, and, holding the tortilla with your fingertips,
peel off the bottom sheet.

Lay the tortillas one by one on the comal and cook about 30 to 40
seconds per side, pressing the top of each tortilla with your
fingertips to make it puff.

Place the hot tortillas in a towel. Serve immediately or let cool,
wrap well in plastic or a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator
up to one week.

Yield: 12 to 24 tortillas
