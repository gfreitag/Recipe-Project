Title: Mashed Potatoes
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Idaho potatoes, peeled and
Quartered
2 ts Kosher salt
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 ts White pepper
Place the potatoes in a 2-quart saucepan with 1 teaspoon of the salt
and cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer,
covered, until completely tender, about 30 minutes. Test the potatoes
by piercing them with a paring knife:  there should be no resistance.
Place in a colander and allow to drain well for several minutes.
Combine the butter, heavy cream, and milk in another saucepan and
heat gently until the butter has melted.  Keep warm. Working over the
saucepan you used for the potatoes, pass the potatoes through a food
mill or a potato ricer. If you have any difficulty, add a little of
the hot milk and butter to the potatoes. To serve, place the potatoes
over a low flame and begin adding the warm milk, cream and butter.
Whip the potatoes with a wooden spoon or spatula while heating.  When
all the liquid is absorbed, season with the remaining salt and white
pepper.  Serve piping hot. Mashed potatoes are best served
immediately, but if you are unable to do so, or need them for another
recipe, keep the potatoes hot for up to one hour by placing them in
the top of a double boiler, covered, and held over barely simmering
water.
