Title: Potato Latkes, With Variations
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Russet potatoes peeled
1/4 c  Finely chopped shallots
2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
2 tb Flour (or more) or matzo
Meal (during Passover)
1 1/2 ts Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
Vegetable oil for frying
In a food processor grate the potatoes. Line a sieve with cheesecloth
and transfer potatoes to the sieve. Set sieve over a bowl, twist
cheesecloth into a pouch, squeezing out some moisture. Let mixture
drain for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, pour off liquid from the bowl
but leave the white potato starch that settles in the bottom of the
bowl.

To that starch add shallots, eggs, flour, 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt and
freshly ground pepper. Return drained potatoes to this mixture and
toss to combine.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Line a baking pan with paper towels.
When you are ready to eat, in a large skillet heat 1/4 inch of oil
over medium high heat until hot. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of
potato mixture and cook for 3 to 4 minutes a side; latkes should be
golden and crisp on both sides. Eat right away or keep warm in oven.
Serve with applesauce or sour cream or cottage cheese mixed with sour
cream

Variations: South Western Style Omit the shallots; mix the batter with
chopped herbs such as cilantro, scallion and dried oregano. Serve
topped with slivers of roasted red peppers, grated Jack cheese and
salsa.

Curried Style mix potatoes with some curry powder. Make a circle of
sliced fresh tomatoes on a dinner plate. Center 3 to 4 overlapping
pancakes in an inner circle and center a dollop of sour cream and hot
pickle in the middle.

Italian style mix potatoes and onion with a smidgen of raw garlic and
thin slices of prosciutto. Cook in olive oil and serve topped with
fresh ricotta cheese and surrounded with a dice of seeded tomatoes
mixed with basil and vinaigrette.
