Essence
Season the rabbit with the Rustic Rub. In a large pot, heat the oil,
over high heat. When the pan is smoking hot, brown the rabbit, about
3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove to a platter and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium, add the brown roux. Add the onions, celery,
bell peppers, shallots, and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes,
stirring constantly until vegetables are wilted. Add the salt,
cayenne, black pepper, and bay leaves. Add the rabbit, andouille
sausage, and wild mushrooms, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the water,
stirring to mix well. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer.
Simmer for 1 hour or until the rabbit is tender. To assemble, ladle
the gumbo into an over-sized bowl and top with the rice. Garnish with
chopped parsley.
