Title: Snow Balls
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 x  The Ultimate Cookie Dough
1/4 c  Powdered sugar
Prepare the Ultimate Cookie Dough and divide it into four equal
parts. Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes or refrigerate up to
4 days.

Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper, or use a clean, ungreased
baking sheet.

Remove one portion of the dough from the refrigerator and knead
lightly until it is pliable. Divide the dough into 12 parts (or, if
you have a #70 or smaller ice cream scoop, scoop the dough into 12
balls). Roll the balls into perfect spheres and place on the prepared
baking sheet.

Bake fro 15 minutes or until very lightly browned and firm. Remove
from the oven. Place the powdered sugar into a wire sieve and dust
the cookies heavily on all sides. Allow to cool.

Yield: 12 snow balls
