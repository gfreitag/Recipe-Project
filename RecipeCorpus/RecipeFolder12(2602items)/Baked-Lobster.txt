Title: Baked Lobster
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Lobster
3/4 c  Crushed Ritz crackers
1 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Soft butter
1 tb Chopped parsley
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  (4 ounces) raw lobster meat
1/4 c  Melted butter
2 tb Chopped parsley
Lemon slices for garnish
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Begin by splitting the lobster, turn
the lobster on its back, with one hand hold down the claws. Place the
tip of the knife on the center of the body. Push the blade down
through the lobsters body and cut it in half lengthwise. Remove the
brains, liver, and coral. Using the back of your knife, crack the
claws in several places. (This will allow for easy removal of the
meat after cooking.) Place the lobster, shell side down, on a baking
sheet. In a small mixing bowl, combine the crackers, butter, parsley,
lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Season the inside of
the lobster with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity of the lobster with
this filling and cover the tail meat with the excess. Bake for 25
minutes or until the meat is white and the crust is golden brown.
