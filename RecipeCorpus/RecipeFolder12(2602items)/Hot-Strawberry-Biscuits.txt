Title: Hot Strawberry Biscuits
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Sifted unbleached all
Purpose flour
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Minced fresh rosemary
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
3 tb Vegetable shortening,
Chilled
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Diced strawberries
Glaze:
3 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1 1/2 tb Sugar
2 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
Biscuits:

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt.  Add the rosemary and lemon zest, and mix until
combined. Quickly blend in the shortening until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Make a well in the center and stir in the buttermilk and
strawberries until just blended.  Do not over mix.

Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead gently 2 to 3
times. Pat the dough into a circle about 1/2 inch thick.  Using a 3
inch round cookie cutter, cut out biscuits and place on a lightly
buttered baking sheet.

Bake until golden, about 20 minutes.  Transfer biscuits to a rack to
cool.

In a bowl, combine the melted butter, sugar, and lemon juice and zest.
Brush glaze over warm biscuits.

Yield: 6-8 biscuits
