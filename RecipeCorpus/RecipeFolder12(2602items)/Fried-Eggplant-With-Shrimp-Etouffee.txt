Preheat the oil for frying. Melt the butter in a large skillet over
medium heat. Add the onions, bell peppers, and celery and saute until
soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2
minutes. Add the shrimp, salt, and cayenne and cook for about 4
minutes, or until the shrimp turn pink Dissolve 2 tablespoons flour
in the water and add to the shrimp mixture. Stir until the mixture
thickens slightly. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 6 to 8
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the parsley and green onions.
Stir and cook for 2 minutes more. Season the eggplant slices with
Essence. Place the flour in a shallow bowl and season with Essence.
In another bowl, season the egg wash with salt and pepper. In a third
shallow bowl, season the bread crumbs with Essence. Dredge each slice
of eggplant in the flour. Dip each slice in the egg wash, letting the
excess drip off. Dredge each slice in the seasoned bread crumbs,
coating each side completely. Carefully lay the eggplant slices in
the hot oil. Fry the eggplant in batches and until golden brown.
Remove the eggplant from the oil and drain on paper-lined plates.
Season the eggplant with Essence. To serve place two to three fried
eggplant pieces in the center of each plate. Spoon the Etouffee over
the top and garnish with the cheese and green onions.
