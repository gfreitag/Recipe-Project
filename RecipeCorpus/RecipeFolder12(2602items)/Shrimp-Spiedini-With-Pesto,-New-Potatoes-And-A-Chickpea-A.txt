Peel shrimp, leaving head and tail piece on. Thread 7 each onto bamboo

Preheat barbecue.

Cut new potatoes into quarters and place in mixing bowl.

Place pine nuts, basil leaves, garlic, Parmesan, Pecorino and 1/2 cup
olive oil in blender and grind until very fine (about 45 seconds).
Add remaining oil in drizzle to form smooth yet very thick sauce and
set aside. In another processor, place ceci, mint, lemon juice, egg,
garlic and half cup of olive oil and blend until smooth, or 1 minute.
Slowly drizzle in remaining oil to create a creamy sauce.

Dress the potatoes with half the pesto and place in center of one of 4
plates.  Grill spiedini for 3 minutes per side and place one on each
plate. Cover shrimp with remaining pesto and drizzle with aioli.
