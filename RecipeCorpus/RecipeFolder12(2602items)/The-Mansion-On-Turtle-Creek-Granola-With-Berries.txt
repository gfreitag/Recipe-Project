Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Rolled oats, uncooked (not
Instant)
1/4 c  Sliced unsalted almonds
1/4 c  Chopped unsalted pistachios
1/8 c  Unsalted pine nuts
1/4 c  Unsalted sunflower seeds
1/4 c  Unsalted pumpkin seeds
1/4 c  Unsweetened coconut flakes
1/4 c  Honey
2 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Light brown sugar
1/4 ts Pure vanilla extract
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Combine oats, nuts, seeds, and coconut flakes. Melt honey, butter, and
brown sugar in a small saucepan over low heat. Add vanilla. Stir to
blend. Place dry ingredients in a roasting pan and pour melted butter
mixture over the top. Mix to blend. Place in preheated 325 degrees
oven and bake for 15 minutes or until golden, stirring every 5
minutes to keep from burning.

Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Granola will be soggy but will
crisp as it cools. Use hands to break it apart if necessary. Serve
with sliced fresh fruit or berries and heavy cream or milk.

Yield: 10 to 12 servings
