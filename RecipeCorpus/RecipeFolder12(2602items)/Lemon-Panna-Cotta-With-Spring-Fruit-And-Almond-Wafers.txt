Title: Lemon Panna Cotta With Spring Fruit And Almond Wafers
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Milk
2    Envelopes gelatin
1 qt Heavy cream
3/4 c  Sugar
4    Lemon zests, stripped with a
Vegetable peeler
1/2    Vanilla bean
Compote of Spring Fruit:
1 pt Strawberries
1    Basket raspberries
4    Apricots
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Kirsch
Have ready 8 molds or ramekins, 4 to 6 ounces each.

To prepare the cream, pour the milk into a bowl, then sprinkle the
gelatin on the surface, allow to stand so that the gelatin absorbs
the milk and softens. Bring the cream to a boil with the sugar and
the strips of lemon zest and split vanilla bean; remove from heat to
steep so that it absorbs the lemon flavor. After 5 minutes, stir in
the softened gelatin and return to a boil, stirring to dissolve the
gelatin. Strain the mixture into a bowl, then fill the mold.
Refrigerate it until set, at least 6 hours. Overnight is best.

To unmold, dip the molds briefly in hot water. Loosen the top of the
dessert by inserting the point of a sharp paring knife about 1/4 -
inch between the cream and the mold, scraping it against the mold all
around. Place a plate on the dessert and invert. Tap the mold at the
top and lift it off. Refrigerate the dessert until it is served.

For the compote, combine all ingredients and refrigerate several
hours.

To serve, remove desserts from refrigerator and surround with some of
the compote and the Almond Wafers (recipe follows).
