8 oz Tomato paste
2 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Chopped carrots
1 c  Chopped celery

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the bones in a shallow
roasting pan. Roast the bones for 1 hour. Remove the bones from the
oven and brush with the tomato paste. In a mixing bowl, toss the

Place the roasting pan on the stove, over high heat. Using a wooden
spoon, deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping the pan and
loosening any brown particles. Place everything in a large stock pot.
Add the bouquet and water. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce
to a simmer. Season the liquid with salt and pepper. Simmer the stock
