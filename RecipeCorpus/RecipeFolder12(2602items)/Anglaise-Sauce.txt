Title: Anglaise Sauce
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Vanilla bean split and
Scraped
5    Egg yolks
In a saucepan, over high heat, whisk the cream together with the
sugar and vanilla bean. Bring to a simmer and remove from the heat.
In a bowl beat the egg yolks until thick and frothy. Temper the egg
yolks by stirring just 1/4 cup of the sauce into the yolks, until
incorporated. Turn the egg yolk mixture into the sauce and stir until
thoroughly blended. Return the saucepan to low heat and cook 2 to 4
minutes, stirring often to prevent scorching. Remove from the heat.
Strain through a fine mesh sieve.
