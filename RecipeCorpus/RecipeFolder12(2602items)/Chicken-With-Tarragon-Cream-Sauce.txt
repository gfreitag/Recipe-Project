2 tb (1/4 stick) butter, room

1/2 c  Water

juices in saucepan. Boil until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Add
cream and tarragon and boil until mixture thickens to sauce
consistency, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Whisk egg yolks
in a bowl. Temper the yolks with cream sauce. Return the yolk mixture
to the rest of the sauce. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Serve
