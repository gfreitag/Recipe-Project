Title: Poached Pears With Marscapone And Espresso Sauce
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Water
1/2 c  White wine
1/2 c  Good Port wine
4 tb Sugar
1    Cinnamon stick
2    To 3 whole cloves
4    Firm Bartlett pears
1 c  Italian marscapone cheese,
Or other fresh, sweet, cow's
Milk cheese
2 tb Clover honey
1/4 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
2 tb Poppy seeds for garnish
2 tb Dried cherries
Bring the water, wines, sugar, and spices to a boil in a pot just
large enough to hold the pears. Lower the heat and simmer for 5
minutes. While the poaching liquid is cooking, peel but do not core
the pears (use a vegetable peeler for the neatest job with the least
waste).

Poach the pears, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until they are just
tender to the tip of a knife. Remove from the heat and cool the pears
in the liquid for another 20 minutes. You can then refrigerate them
(still in the liquid) for later use.

In a stainless steel bowl, combine the marscapone, honey, vanilla,
cinnamon, and nutmeg and whisk to form a smooth creamy filling. Place
the cheese filling into a clean pastry bag fitted with a star tip.

Remove the pears from the liquid, drain and dry them. Cut the pears
in half lengthwise, and remove the core with a teaspoon, making a
neat opening for the marscapone filling. Slice a sliver off the round
side of the pear to steady it on the plate.

Pipe a neat star-shaped dollop into the pear, place it in a serving
dish, pour some espresso sauce around it and garnish with poppy seeds
and dried cherries.

Yield: 4 full and 8 small portions.
