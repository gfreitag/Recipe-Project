Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 c  Chopped onions
Salt and cayenne
2 lb Ground venison
1 tb Chili powder
2 ts Ground cumin
Crushed red pepper
2 ts Dried oregano
2 tb Chopped garlic
3 c  Crushed tomatoes
1/2 c  Tomato paste
3 c  Beef stock
2 tb Masa flour
1 1/2 lb Shoestring potatoes
1/2 lb Grated Cheddar cheese
1/2 lb Grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 c  Sour cream
1/2 c  Pickled jalapenos
Preheat the fryer. In a large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil. When
the oil is hot, add the onions and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
the vegetables start to wilt. Season with salt and cayenne. Stir in
the venison , chili powder, cumin, crushed red pepper, and oregano.
Brown the meat for 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, tomatoes,
tomato paste, and 2 1/2 cups beef stock. Bring the liquid up to a
boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the liquid, uncovered for 1 hour,
stirring occasionally, or until the venison is tender. Skim off the
fat occasionally. Mix the masa and remaining stock together. Slowly
stir in the masa slurry and continue to cook for 30 minutes. Reseason
with salt and cayenne. Fry the shoestring potatoes in batches until
golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the shoestrings from the
oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fries with salt and
pepper. Cover the bottom of a large, glass rectangular pan with the
shoestrings. Sprinkle 3 cups of the two cheeses over the fries. Place
the fries in the oven and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, just until the
cheese melts. Remove the pan from the oven and spoon the chili over
the top of the fries. Garnish with the remaining cheese, sour cream
and jalapenos.
