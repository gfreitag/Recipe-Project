Serving, if desired
Butter and flour a 9 or 10inch round cake pan and line the base of it
with baking parchment. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with an electric
mixer until the mixture is pale yellow and will hold a ribbon.
Drizzle the melted butter around the edges of the bowl and fold the
mixture together gently but thoroughly. Set aside. Sift the flour,
ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together and set aside. In
another, larger mixing bowl, beat the egg whites to the soft peak
stage.

Fold half of the egg yolk mixture into the beaten egg whites. Fold in
the dry ingredients and stir in the dates, pecans, and raisins. Fold
in the remaining yolk mixture. Pour the batter into the pan and shake
it a little to find its level. Bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack and then run a
sharp knife around the edge to loosen the cake and turn it out onto a
platter. Sprinkle confectioners sugar over the top and serve cut into
wedges, accompanied by coconut ice cream, if desired.

Yield: one 9 or 10inch round loaf
