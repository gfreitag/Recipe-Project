Juice of 3 limes
1 1/2    Cloves garlic, finely

1    White onion, finely chopped
1/2 sm Bunch cilantro, coarsely

1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 c  Olive oil
24    Jumbo shrimp, peeled and

For the Bread and Salad:
1/2 c  Olive oil

1    Clove garlic, minced
12    (1inch square) cubes of
Stale country white bread
6 sl Thinly sliced smoked bacon,
Cut into 1inch squares
1    Head Boston lettuce, cut
Into a fine chiffonade
2 tb Red wine vinegar
Lime wedges, for serving
Soak the skewers in water for at least 1, preferably 3 hours.

In a large glass bowl, whisk together the lime juice, garlic, onion,
cilantro, salt, pepper and olive oil. Add the shrimp and toss to coat
evenly. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours,
tossing once or twice. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and drain
briefly. Reserve the shrimp marinade.

In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the olive oil with 1/2 teaspoon
salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and the minced garlic. Toss the bread cubes
in this mixture, making sure they are evenly coated, and let sit for
about 3 minutes.

Preheat a grill or broiler to mediumhigh heat. Thread 4 shrimp, 4
squares of bacon and 2 bread cubes onto each skewer, alternating and
placing bacon on both sides of each bread cube. Grill the skewers for
about 2 minutes on each of all 4 sides, brushing with a little more
of the bread marinade as they cook.

In a large bowl, toss the lettuce chiffonade with the remaining 1/4
cup olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Add the vinegar and toss
again briefly. Make a bed of lettuce on a plate, perch a skewer on
the top, and spoon a little of the remaining shrimp marinade over the
top. Garnish the plate with lime wedges and serve.
