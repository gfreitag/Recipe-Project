Title: Sweet Dough for Pies
Categories: Live
Yield: 2 Crusts
2 c  All-purpose bleached flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
8 tb (1 stick) cold unsalted
Butter, cut into 8 pieces
2 lg Eggs
In a food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in
bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to
mix. Add butter to work bowl and pulse about 15 times until mixture
is fine and powdery and resembles coarse ground cornmeal and no large
pieces remain. Add the eggs and pulse ten times or so, until the
dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface
and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3
or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform.

Press the dough into 2 equal disks. Sandwich the disks of dough
between two pieces of plastic wrap and press into a 6-inch circle.
Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it,
at least 1 hour.

Yield: 1 (2 crust) pie dough
