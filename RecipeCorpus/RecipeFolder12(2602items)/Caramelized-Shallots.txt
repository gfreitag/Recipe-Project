Title: Caramelized Shallots
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
16    To 24 large shallots, about
1 lb (small onions may be
Substituted)
3 tb Unsalted butter
3 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
To taste
1/4 c  Chicken stock
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Peel the papery skin off the shallots, being careful to leave them
whole as whole as possible.  Put the butter into a saute pan over
medium heat until it begins to bubble.  Add the shallots, shaking the
pan to coat them with butter, and brown on all sides until nicely
caramelized to a rich, golden brown color.  This will take about 6 to
8 minutes. Sprinkle with the sugar, add the salt, pepper, and stock,
and bring to a boil. Pour the contents of the saute pan into a
casserole or baking dish. Place into the oven for
20    minutes. Check after 10 minutes to stir the contents of
the dish and to ensure that the liquid has not evaporated. If it has,
add several tablespoons of water to keep the dish moist until the
shallots have cooked completely. After the shallots have roasted for
20 minutes, the liquid will have evaporated and the shallots should
be caramelized to a rich dark golden brown color and should be tender
when pierced with a knife.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
