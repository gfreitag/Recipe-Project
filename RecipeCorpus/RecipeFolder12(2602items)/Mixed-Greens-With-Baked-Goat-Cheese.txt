Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Arugula
Baby Romaine
Red Leaf Lettuce
Curly Endive
Radicchio
Baked Goat Cheese
Pear Vinaigrette:
3/8 c  Pear vinegar
1/2 c  Walnut oil
Tender, freshly picked garden greens are the first choice for this
hearty salad, but limestone, butter, and green leaf lettuces are good
substitutes. Watercress can be added for a crunchy, tangy contrast to
milder greens. Select a mild goat cheese, as baking intensifies its
flavor. To bake goat cheese:  Brush slices with olive oil, coat with
white and black sesame seeds, and bake at 350 degrees until soft,
approximately 10 to 15 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk vinegar and
walnut oil together. Toss vinaigrette with mixed greens and serve
with baked goat cheese.
