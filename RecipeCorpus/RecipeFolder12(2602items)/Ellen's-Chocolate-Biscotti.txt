Title: Ellen's Chocolate Biscotti
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
2/3 c  Alkalized cocoa powder
2 ts Baking powder
pn Salt
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/3 c  Chopped, skinned hazelnut or
Walnuts
4 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
Preheat oven to 325 degrees and set rack in the middle level of the
oven. Cover 2 large cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment
or foil.

Mix the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt and sift into a mixing
bowl. Stir in the sugar and nuts.

Whisk the eggs and vanilla and stir into the flour mixture to form a
dough.

On a lightly floured surface, press dough together.  Divide dough in
half and roll into a log the length of the pan (14 to 18 inches)
Place each log on the pan and flatten slightly.  Bake for about 30
minutes, until well risen and firm.  Cool the logs on the pans.

After the logs have cooled, detach from paper and slice them about
1/2-inch thick with a sharp serrated knife.  Place back on paper
lined pans, cut side down, and bake again for about 20 minutes, or
until dry and crisp. Cool on pans and store in a tin or plastic
container with a tight fitting lid.

Yield:  about 5 dozen
