Mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl with a whisk. In a mixer
or by hand, in a separate bowl whip egg whites to soft peaks. Add 1/2
cup of sugar to egg whites and mix until stiff peaks form.

In another bowl whisk yolks, vanilla extract and 1 cup of sugar to a
ribbon stage. Add a small amount of dry ingredients to the yolk
mixture and alternate with a little of egg whites. Using a rubber
spatula, continue folding until all ingredients are combined.

Bake at 375 degrees F on a greased half sheet tray or a cookie sheet
lined with parchment and grease again. Bake approximately 12 to 14
minutes or until springy and toothpick is almost dry. Do not overcook.

STRAWBERRY OR RASPBERRY FILLING: In a blender combine ingredients for
approximately 1 minute or until smooth. Reserve as filling.

GANACHE FOR GLAZING CAKE: Whip egg yolks, sugar and vanilla until
lightly fluffy. Cut chocolate into small pieces, place in sauce pan
and add the cream. Heat to approximately 150 degrees F stirring
constantly. Stir hot cream mixture into the egg yolks and continue
stirring for 1 minute to assure that sugar is melted. Keep warm and
ready for glazing.

CHOCOLATE GARNISH WINGS: Melt over a double boiler and place into a
piping bag or a parchment cone. On a separate sheet of parchment
paper pipe out wings freehand or draw with a stencil to trace. Place
in freezer so they set up. Reserve for garnish.

STRAWBERRY OR RASPBERRY WHITE CHOCOLATE SAUCE: Over a double boiler
melt white chocolate. Add water and mix until no lumps remain.
Roughly chop berries and add to sauce. Reserve.

TO ASSEMBLE CAKE: Take cake and cut into two triangles then cut each
in half laterally. On bottom half, ladle berry filling and evenly
distribute. Then apply white chocolate berry sauce. You can at this
point add fresh berry slices if desired. Place top half back on top
then place cake on a wire rack for glazing.

Using warm ganache ladle glaze on top of cake and allow to run down
sides. If ganache is thin add another coat.

Place in refrigerator until glaze is solid. Take a whisk and splatter
white chocolate sauce on top and decorate with more berries. With
wings, they can garnish entire cake or you can use smaller wings to
garnish each individual serving.
