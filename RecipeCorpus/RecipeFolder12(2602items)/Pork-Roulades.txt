Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4    (6-ounce) pork loins
4 lg Pieces of plastic wrap
1 c  Chopped walnuts, sauteed in
2    To 3 tablespoons butter
(duxelle)
1    Avocado, peeled, pitted, and
Cut into 16 slices, in all
Salt and pepper
Essence
12 sl Homemade bacon
8 oz Bacon, chopped
2 tb Chopped shallots
2 ts Chopped garlic
2 tb Armagnac or cognac
2 c  Beef or veal demi-glace
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Butter, at room temperature
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place each pork loin between 2
pieces of plastic wrap.  With a beef mallet, lightly pound out the
pork loin, very thin 1/6 to 1/8-inch thick.  Unwrap the pork loin and
season both sides with salt and pepper.  Lay three slices of the
bacon on a flat surface. Place the pork on top of the bacon along one
end. Spread 1/4 cup of the duxelle over the top of each pork loin.
Divide the avocado slices into fourths and lay the slices on top of
the duxelle.

Gently roll up each pork with the bacon.  Place the roulades on a
baking sheet, seam side down,

lined with parchment paper, and roast until the bacon is brown and
crisp and the pork meat is tender, for about 30 minutes.  Remove from
the oven and allow the roulades to rest for 5 minutes, before
slicing. Using a very sharp knife, trim off the ends of each roulade
and cut each across into 4 slices.  In a sauce pan, render the
chopped bacon, until crispy for about 8 minutes.  Add the shallots,
garlic, and Armagnac and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the demi-glace,
sugar, salt and pepper. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a
simmer. Cook for 20 minutes. Whisk in the butter and remove from the
heat and serve with the roulades.  To assemble, spoon 1/4 cup of the
sauce on each of 4 plates and arrange 4 roulades slices on top.
