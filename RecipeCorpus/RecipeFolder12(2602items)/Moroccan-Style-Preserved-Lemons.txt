Title: Moroccan-Style Preserved Lemons
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
12    Unblemished organically
Grown small lemons
(preferably Meyer lemons)
Kosher or table salt
Wash and dry the lemons. If using store-bought lemons, scrub them
carefully to remove any pesticides. Cut a thin slice from the top and
bottom of each lemon. Set one lemon on end and make a vertical cut
three quarters of the way through the fruit, so that the two halves
still remain attached at the base; do not cut it in half. Turn the
lemon upside down and rotate it so that you can make a second
vertical cut down the center, crosswise to the first, leaving the
bottom arched, as you did previously. Fill each cut with as much salt
as it will hold.

Carefully place the lemon at the bottom of a hot, sterilized,
wide-mouthed glass jar. Proceed in this manner with the remaining
lemons, compressing them in the jar until no space is left and the
lemon juice has risen to the top. Seal and set aside at room
temperature. More lemons may be added in the following days as the
lemon rinds begin to soften.

Yield: 12 lemons
