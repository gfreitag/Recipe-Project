Title: Jalapeno Hushpuppies
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2    Yellow cornmeal
1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 ts Crystal hot sauce
1/4 c  Mined onions
2    Fresh jalapenos, minced
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Milk
Preheat the fryer. In a mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour,
baking powder, salt, hot sauce, onions, and jalapenos, together. Stir
in the eggs and milk. Mix until fully incorporated. Fry 1 tablespoon
of the batter at a time. Fry the hushpuppies for 2-3 minutes or until
they are golden brown. Stirring constantly will ensure over-all
browning. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate.
Season with Essense.

Yields: about 1 1/2 dozen
