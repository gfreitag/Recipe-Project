Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Plus 1/2 cup oil, divided
1 tb Flour
1/4 c  New Mexican chili powder
16 oz Chicken stock
10 oz Tomato puree
1 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Ground cumin

3 c  Grated cheddar cheese
2 c  Cooked and shredded chicken
1    Onion, chopped
10    Corn tortillas
1 c  Sour cream, for garnish
1/2 c  Chopped scallions, for

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make sauce: In a saucepan heat 3
tablespoons oil, add flour and cook, whisking, 1 minute. Add chili
powder and cook 30 seconds. Stir in stock, tomato puree, oregano and
cumin and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes until
flavors are well-blended. Season to taste with salt.

Combine cheese, chicken and onion for filling. Heat remaining 1/2 cup
oil in a skillet until hot. Using tongs dip in tortillas, one at a
time, to soften, and drain on paper towels. Dip each tortilla in
sauce. On a plate fill with a generous spoonful of filling and roll
up; place enchilada seam-side down in a baking dish and repeat until
all ingredients are used up. Top with remaining sauce. Bake 30
minutes. To serve, top with sour cream and scallions.
