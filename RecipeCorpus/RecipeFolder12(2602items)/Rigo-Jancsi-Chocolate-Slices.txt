Title: Rigo Jancsi Chocolate Slices
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3    Eggs, separated
3 tb Caster sugar
1 oz Dark chocolate, grated
2 tb Plain flour
For the filling:
Apricot jam
1 oz Cocoa powder
Vanilla essence
6 oz Double cream, stiffly
Whipped for the chocolate
Icing
6 oz Dark chocolate
1 oz Unsalted butter
Cream together the egg yolks and sugar. Whisk the egg whites until
very stiff. Add the grated chocolate and flour to the yolk mixture,
then fold in the whites. Line and grease a 1 1/2 pound loaf pan and
pour in chocolate mixture. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees
for 15 to 20 minutes. Turn out and cool on a rack. When cold, slice
in half lengthways through the middle.

Spread both halves of cake with jam on the cut sides. For the
filling, mix together all the remaining ingredients and spread evenly
over one half on top of the jam. Make the icing by melting the
chocolate with the butter. Allow to cool slightly, then spread over
the jam on the other half. Put the two strips together so that the
icing and filling are together in the middle, with the iced strip on
top, and chill slightly before slicing to serve.
