This recipe is a two day procedure. Make sure that your butcher
thoroughly cleans the suckling pig. By cleaning inside and out and
removes the eyeballs. With a knife make several cuts on the pig's
skin so the skin doesn't burst during cooking. Prop the pig's mouth
open with a small yam. Season the entire pig with kosher salt and
cracked black pepper. Place the pig in a garbage bag and tie the back
tightly. Place the pig in the refrigerator and chill for 12 hours.
Remove from the refrigerator and rinse thoroughly. In a mixing bowl
combine the garlic, parsley, thyme, cumin, bay leaves, onions, juice
of the orange, lime, lemon, olive oil and wine. Whisk the marinade
until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Place the pig back
in the bag and pour the marinade over the pig. Tie the back tightly
and place back in the refrigerator. Turn the pig every three hours.
Refrigerate the pig for 12 hours. Remove the pig from the
refrigerator and out of the bag, reserve the marinade. Stuff the
cavity with the stuffing. Using a kitchen needle and thread, tie up
the cavity. Tie the front legs and then back legs. Cover the tail
with aluminum foil. Place the pig on a large roasting pan and pour
the reserved marinade over the pig. Place the pig in the oven. Roast
the pig for about 5 hours, basting and turning the pig every hour.
Remove the pig from the oven and allow the pig to rest for about 30
minutes before slicing. Yield: about 12 servings
