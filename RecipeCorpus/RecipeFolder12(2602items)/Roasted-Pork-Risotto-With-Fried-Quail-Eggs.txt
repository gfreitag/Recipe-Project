Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Salt
Coarsely ground black
Pepper
1 lb Boneless pork shoulder
(Boston Butt) trimmed and
Cut into 2 inches
By 1/2-inch strips
1/2 tb Cumin seed (toasted in a dry
Pan and ground)
1/4 c  Olive oil
6 tb Butter
1    Onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 c  Arborio Rice
1/2 c  White wine
3 c  Chicken broth
2 c  Wild mushrooms (such as
Chanterelles, porchini, or
Shiitakes,) cut
Into thick pieces
1 ts Fresh thyme
1 ts Finely chopped fresh parsley

6    Fried quail eggs
Season the pork with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl, whisk the
cumin and olive oil together. Place the meat in a glass baking dish.
Pour the marinade over the meat and marinate for 2 hours, under
refrigeration. Sear in a hot cast iron skillet over very high heat
for 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and allow to rest for
a couple of minutes. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy
saucepan. Add the onions and saute for 4 minutes, or until softened.
Add the rice and cook for 3 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon.
Add the wine and bring to a boil. Add 1/2 cup of the stock and stir
vigorously with a wooden spoon and allow to simmer and evaporate
before adding more broth. Continue cook, adding broth as needed.
After 15 minutes, begin tasting for correct doneness-firm but tender.
Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter, the mushrooms and roast
pork. Season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly. Garnish with
thyme, parsley and the fried quail eggs.
