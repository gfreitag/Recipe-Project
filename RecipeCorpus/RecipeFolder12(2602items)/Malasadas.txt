Title: Malasadas
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    ( 1/4-ounce) package of
Active dry yeast
3/4 c  Plus 1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 c  Warm water (110 degrees F)
6    Eggs
6 c  Flour
1/4 c  Melted butter
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Whole milk
1/2 c  Half and half
Sugar to roll the Malasadas
Preheat the fryer. In a small mixing bowl, whisk the yeast, 1 teaspoon
sugar, and 1/4 cup of the warm water. Set the mixture aside. In an
electric mixer, and the eggs and whip until the eggs are thick and
pale yellow in color. Change the mixer attachment to a dough hook.
With the machine running slowly add the yeast mixture, melted butter,
milk, and half and half. Add the salt. Add the flour, 1 cup at a
time. Mix until the mixture forms a soft ball, leaves the sides of
the bowl, and climbs up the dough hook. Remove the dough and turn
into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set
the bowl in a warm, draft free space. Let the dough rise until double
in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface
and dust the surface of the dough with flour. With a rolling pin,
roll out the dough, about 1/4-inch thick, in the shape of a
rectangle. Cover the dough with a greased piece of plastic wrap (this
will prevent the dough from sticking to the wrap) and the dough rise
until double in size, about 1 hour. Using a sharp French knife, cut
the dough into 1 inch squares. Fry a couple of the squares at a time,
until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly for
overall browning. Remove the doughnuts from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Roll the doughnuts in sugar and serve warm.
