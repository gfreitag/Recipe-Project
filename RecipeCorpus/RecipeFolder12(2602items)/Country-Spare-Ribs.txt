Title: Country Spare Ribs
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Soy sauce
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
4 ts Hoisin sauce
4 ts Minced garlic
2 lb Country-style spare ribs,
Cut into 8 pieces, 1/2-inch
Thick
Mix the first 5 ingredients together in a bowl. Fit the meat snugly
into a bowl or pan and pour marinade over meat. Cover and refrigerate
20 hours.

Remove all racks, but topmost, from oven, place a drip pan on the
floor of the oven with an inch of water in it, and preheat oven to
375 degrees. Insert 4 hooks along the length of each rack of
spareribs at regular intervals, then hook them onto the top oven rack
above the drip pan in 2 rows. Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes,
replenishing the water in the drip pan if necessary. You may
interrupt the cooking now and freeze the ribs. Bring them to room
temperature before you finish them in any one of the following 3
ways: (1) Increase the oven heat to 420 degrees for 15 minutes to
brown and crisp; (2) transfer to a broiler and broil 5 minutes on
bony side, 6 to 7 minutes on meat side; or (3) put them aside and
finish outside on a grill until crisp.
