Categories: Molto

1/2    Basic bread dough recipe
NOTE: Prepare basic bread
Dough recipe using semolina
Flour
2 tb Virgin olive oil plus 4
Tablespoons
1 lb Broccoli, broken into 1-inch
Florets, stems sliced
1/4    -inch thick
Freshly grated nutmeg
1 lb Fresh ricotta
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
Sea salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
(I recommend buying a prepared tile baking stone for all pizza and
bread working at home. They are available at gourmet shops and
specialty chef supply stores).

Preheat oven and baking tile to 450 degrees.

Split dough into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other, and
roll out into 2 rounds about 12 inches in diameter, again one
slightly larger than the other. Place larger sheet on paddle and
spread with coarse sea salt.

In a 12-to 14-inch sautJ pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over
medium high heat. Add broccoli and cook until softened and light
brown, stirring constantly, about 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool and
season with several gratings of fresh nutmeg.

Smear the large sheet with 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil and
sprinkle with half the bread crumbs. Spread ricotta over the sheet and
smear within 1-inch of the edge. Place broccoli pieces on top of
ricotta and sprinkle with remaining olive oil and then bread crumbs.
Place smaller piece of dough on top and roll edges of bottom and top
together to seal. Brush top with water and then oil and slide onto
tile in oven and bake 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown. Remove
from oven and let rest 5 minutes before serving.
