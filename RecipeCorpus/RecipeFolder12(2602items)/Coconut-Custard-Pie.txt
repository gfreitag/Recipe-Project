Title: Coconut Custard Pie
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
9    Inch pie crust, prepared or
Home made
For the filling:
2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
3 c  Grated fresh coconut
4 lg Eggs
1/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Grated toasted coconut
Lightly whipped cream and
Additional toasted coconut
For garnish
Trim the edge of the shell, leaving a 1/2 inch overhang. Crimp the
edge over the shell decoratively. Prick the dough with a fork and
chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line with wax
paper, weight and bake the shell in the lower third of the oven for
15 minutes. Remove the wax paper and rice. Reduce the oven
temperature to 375 degrees and bake the shell for 10 minutes more or
until golden. Transfer the shell to a rack and let cool.

Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and butter the second pie
plate. In a saucepan bring the heavy cream to a simmer, stir in 2
cups of the fresh coconut, remove from the heat and let the mixture
stand for 20 minutes, or until it is room temperature. Transfer the
coconut milk to the food processor and blend it for 1 minute. Strain
the mixture through a sieve lined with cheesecloth to extract all of
the liquid, and add the eggs, sugar, vanilla and salt. Stir in the
remaining 1 cup coconut and pour the custard into the pie plate. Put
the pie plate in a larger pan, add enough hot water to the pan to
come halfway up the sides of the plate and bake in the middle of the
oven for twenty minutes or until the edges of the custard are set.
The center of the custard will still be a bit loose. Add additional
toasted coconut to the top of the custard and bake for another
10    minutes.
