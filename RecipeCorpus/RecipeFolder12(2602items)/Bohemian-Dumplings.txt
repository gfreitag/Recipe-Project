1 c  Milk
2    Egg yolks
Salt
2 c  Diced stale white bread
4 tb Butter
1/3 c  Melted room temperature
Goose fat.

Sift the flour into a bowl. In another bowl mix together the milk and
egg yolks with a little bit of salt. Add the milk mixture to the
flour and blend to a smooth dough.

Saute the bread in the butter over moderate heat until golden.
Sprinkle the bread over the dough. Pour on the goose fat and let the
mixture mellow 1 hour. Blend the bread into the dough. Beat 2 egg
whites until stiff and fold them into the dough.

Soak a tea towel in water, squeeze it dry and line a sieve with it.
Add the dough and pull the cloth up around the dough and tie it off
immediately above dough. Transfer the wrapped dough to a pot of
simmering water with a rack and poach it for 1 hour. Transfer it to a
platter, let it cool a little, and then untie it and cut the dumpling
with a thread into slices.
