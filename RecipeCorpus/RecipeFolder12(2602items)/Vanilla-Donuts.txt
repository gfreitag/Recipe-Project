Yeast
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Butter
1    Whole vanilla bean, split in
Half, scraped, bean
Reserved
1 1/4 c  Milk
4    To 5 cups flour
Preheat the fryer. In a sauce pan, combine the milk and vanilla bean
together. Bring the milk up to a simmer, remove from the heat and
cool the milk to 85 degrees. Using an electric mixing bowl, combine
the yeast, sugar, butter and vanilla scrapings together. Remove the

the flour mixture into the yeast mixture. Using a dough hook, on low

continue beating until the dough is formed and starts to climb up the
dough hook, about 2 minutes.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover. Place the dough
in a warm place and let the dough to rise until double in size, about
1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Roll the dough out
into 1/2-inch thickness. Cut half the dough out into squares. Cut the
remaining dough into 1-inch strips. Cut the strips in half. Braid two
strips together, sealing each end tightly. Let the doughnuts rise
until double in size, about 20 minutes. Fry the doughnuts for 1
minute on each side. Remove from the fryer and drain on a paper-lined
plate.
