Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4    Individual pie crust rounds
1 tb Butter
2 lb Persimmon, medium dice
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Grand Marnier
Juice of one lemon
2 tb Cornstarch
1/2 c  Cold water
4    Scoops vanilla bean ice
Cream
Shaker of powdered sugar
Shaker with cinnamon and
Sugar mixture
1/2 c  Caramel sauce in a squeeze
Bottle
Preheat the oven to 425F. Butter four 4 ounce ramekins.

For the filling:  In a sauce pan, over high heat combine the
persimmons, sugar, Grand Marnier, and lemon juice.  Bring the mixture
up to a boil. Combine the cornstarch and the cold water together,
making a slurry. While whisking the fruit constantly, add the slurry.
Cook the mixture for 5-6 minutes or until the mixture thickens. Cool
the mixture for about 10 minutes.  Spoon 1/4 of the fruit mixture
into each of the four ramekins. Gently lay the individual pie crusts
over each ramekin. Using your hands, form the crust around the lip of
the ramekin, cutting off any excess pie crust.  Place in the oven and
bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. To assemble, place the
ramekin on a plate.  Place a scoop of vanilla ice cream right on top
of the pie.  Drizzle the caramel over the top. Sprinkle with powdered
sugar and cinnamon mixture.
