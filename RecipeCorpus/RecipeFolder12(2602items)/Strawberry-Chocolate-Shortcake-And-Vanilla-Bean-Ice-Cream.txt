3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Plus 1 teaspoon butter

1/4 c  Cocoa powder
2 ts Baking powder

In another mixing bowl, combine the strawberries and 1/2 cup sugar.
Using a fork, lightly mash the berries.  Cover and refrigerate for 1
hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet with 1
teaspoon of the butter.  In a mixing bowl, sift the flour, cocoa,
salt and baking powder together.  Add the remaining sugar and mix
well. Add the remaining butter and work it into the dry ingredients,
using your hands, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Fold in
the chocolate milk. The dough will be sticky. Dust your work surface
with 1 tablespoon of the flour. Turn the dough onto the floured
surface.  Gently fold each side towards the center. Pick up the dough
and dust the work surface with the remaining tablespoon flour.
Return the dough to the floured surface and fold each side towards
the center again.  Turn the dough over and lightly press it out to 1
inch thickness.  Cut the biscuits using a 2 1/4-inch round cookie
cutter. Place them on the baking sheet and bake until golden, about
30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely. To assemble,
cut the biscuits in half. Place a scoop of the ice cream in the
center of each biscuit. Place the shortcakes in the center of each
plate.  Spoon the strawberries over the shortcakes.  Garnish with
powdered sugar and serve immedietly.
