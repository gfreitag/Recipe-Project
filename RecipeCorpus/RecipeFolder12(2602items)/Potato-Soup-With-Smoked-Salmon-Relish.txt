Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1/2    Stick unsalted butter
1 1/4 lb Yellow onions, thinly sliced
(about 4 cups)
3    Ribs celery, chopped (about
1    Cup)
Salt
Cayenne
Freshly ground black pepper
1    Bay leave
3 tb Chopped garlic
10 c  Chicken stock
2 lb Baking potatoes, peeled and
Diced
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/2 lb Smoked salmon, julienne
1/4 c  Brunoise red onions
2 tb Chopped chives
Drizzle of extra-virgin
Olive oil
Melt the butter in a 6-quart stock pot over medium-high heat. Add the
onions and celery. Season with salt, cayenne, and black pepper,
stirring, until the vegetables are soft and lightly golden, about 8
minutes. Add the bay leaf and garlic, stirring for 2 minutes. Add the
stock and potatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat
to medium and simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes are very soft and
the mixture is thick and creamy, about 1 hour. Remove the soup from
the heat. Discard the bay leaf. With a hand-held blender, puree until
smooth. Slowly add the cream. Stir to blend. Reseason the soup. In a
small mixing bowl, combine the salmon, red onions and chives. Drizzle
the relish with enough oil to moisten. Season the relish with black
pepper. To serve, ladle the soup into individual bowls. Garnish the
soup with the relish.
