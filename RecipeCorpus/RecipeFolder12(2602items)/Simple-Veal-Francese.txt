Title: Simple Veal Francese
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Veal scallops from leg
Salt and pepper
1    Egg, beaten well
Flour for dredging
6 tb Butter
1 c  Dry white wine
Place veal pieces between 2 sheets of waxed paper and pound with a
mallet until they're thin. Season with salt and pepper. Place the
beaten egg in a wide, shallow bowl. Place the flour on a wide plate.
Dip the pounded veal in the egg. Remove, letting the excess egg drip
off. Place each scallop in the flour, and coat lightly. Remove the
scallops from the flour, and hold them in a single layer.

Add 4 tablespoons of the butter to a saute pan large enough to hold
the 6 scallops in a single layer. Melt the butter over medium-high
heat. When it foams, add the veal. Saute, turning once, until the
scallops are golden on the outside. Remove the scallops and hold in a
single layer.

Spill the butter out of the saute pan, and return the pan to high
heat. Add the white wine and reduce it to 1/2 cup. Turn heat to very
low. Swirl in the butter until the sauce is thickened. Add the
reserved veal to the pan, turning them until they are coated with the
sauce. Divide scallops among 2 plates, pour remaining sauce over
them, serve immediately.
