Title: Berry Tiramisu
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Fresh raspberries
1 c  Fresh blueberries
1 c  Fresh blackberries
1 c  Sliced strawberries
1 c  Sugar
Juice of one lemon
2 pt Heavy cream
8 oz Mascarpone cheese
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1    Prepared sponge cake,
(9"x9"x2"), sliced into 3
Layers
1 c  Chambord liqueur
1/2 c  Raspberry coulis
Fresh mint sprigs
Powdered sugar in shaker
In a mixing bowl, combine all the berries with the sugar and lemon
juice. With a fork, lightly mash 1/4 of the berries against the side
of the bowl. Allow the berries to sit for 1 hour. Using an electric
mixer, whip the cream until stiff peaks form. In a mixing bowl, fold
half of the whipped cream into the Mascarpone cheese, along with the
powdered sugar. Blend until the cream is fully incorporated. To
assemble, lay one layer of the sponge cake on the bottom of the pan.
Brush the layer with the Chambord.

Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over the sponge cake. Repeat the
procedure until all of the cake and cheese mixture are used. Spread
the reserved whipped cream over the top of the cake. Allow the cake
to set, about 1 hour. Place a slice of the tirmisu on the plate.
Garnish with raspberry coulis, fresh mint and powdered sugar.
