MENU OF THE WEEK by Georgia Downard, Culinary Director

Tis the season for pears! We've just returned from our local green
market where pears are playing to standing ovations. Stall after
stall were filled with this wonderfully juicy fruit in all its
varieties. Pears are at a season high both in flavor and supply.
According to the weekly produce newspaper The Packer, "Evidence
already suggests the bigger crop will mean lower prices than last
year.." So join us in celebrating this magnificent fruit. We've
included a selection of recipes which should satisfy all pear lovers
and make converts of others!

PEAR, CRANBERRY AND HORSERADISH CHUTNEY

(Serve with roast chicken, turkey or duck, also good with ham or
pork. A delicious addition to a holiday table.)

DUCK BREAST OVER GREENS

(The pears in this recipe are a light and refreshing foil to the
sauteed duck. This dish is very quick and suitable for entertaining.
Chicken breast can be substituted for duck, simply increase the
cooking time.)

POACHED PEARS WITH MASCARPONE AND ESPRESSO SAUCE

(This is a beautiful, celebratory dish that does justice to the
perfectly formed pear. Remember that the pears can be poached ahead
of time and chilled.)
