coat the wings with the sauce. Chill the wings, covered, stirring
them occasionally, overnight. Arrange the wings, skin side down, on a
baking sheet large enough to hold them in one layer and bake them in
the lower third of a preheated 375 degree oven for 25 minutes. Turn
the wings and bake them for 20 minutes more. Serve the wings on a
platter, hot or at room temperature.
