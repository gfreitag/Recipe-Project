Title: Torta Caprese
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
6 oz Semisweet chocolate
1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter
2/3 c  Sugar, divided
8 lg Eggs, separated
1 1/3 c  Walnut pieces, about 5 1/2
Ounces
1/3 c  All purpose flour
Confectioners' sugar
Butter and line with parchment paper a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, setting a rack in the middle level.

Cut the chocolate finely and place in a small bowl over hot water to
melt, stirring occasionally. Remove the bowl from the pan and cool
the chocolate slightly. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter with
half the sugar until soft and light. Beat in the chocolate, then the
yolks, one at a time, scraping bowl and beaters often. Continue
beating until the mixture is smooth and light. Place the walnuts in
the bowl of a food processor and grind them finely, pulsing the
machine on and off at 1-second intervals. Be careful that the walnuts
do not become pasty. Stir the walnuts, then the flour into the
batter. In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites until they hold a
soft peak and beat in the remaining sugar in a slow stream. Beat the
whites until they hold a soft, glossy peak. Stir 1/4 of the whites
into the batter, then fold in the rest with a rubber spatula, so that
no streaks remain. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth
the top. Bake the Torta Caprese about 40 minutes, until the center is
firm when pressed with a fingertip. Cool the cake in the pan for 10
minutes. The cake may sink slightly, although this does not affect
its texture. Trim off any loose crust and invert the cake on a rack,
remove the pan and allow to cool completely. Dust the cake with
confectioners' sugar and slide onto a platter.

Yield: one 10-inch cake.
