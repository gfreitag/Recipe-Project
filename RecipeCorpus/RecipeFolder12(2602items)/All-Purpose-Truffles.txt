Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Heavy whipping cream
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Light corn syrup
8 oz Semisweet, bittersweet or
Milk chocolate, melted
Coating:
12 oz Semisweet or bittersweet
Chocolate
2 c  Alkalized (Dutch process)
Cocoa powder

Foil
To make centers, combine cream, butter and corn syrup in a
non-reactive pan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Remove from
heat and allow to cool 5 minutes.

Add cream mixture to chocolate and whisk smooth.

Cool center about 2 to 3 hours at room temperature, until it reaches
about
80    degrees.

Whip the mixture using an electric mixer on medium speed fitted with
the paddle then spoon mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a
1/2-inch plain tube (Ateco #6 or #806). Pipe 3/4-inch balls onto
prepared pan. Chill the centers for at least an hour.

To coat the truffles, melt the chocolate and allow it to cool to 90
degrees. Coat truffles, using your hand to cover truffles with
chocolate, depositing them into a pan of sifted cocoa.

Roll finished truffles in a strainer over waxed paper to remove excess
cocoa. Lift truffles from strainer and leave excess cocoa behind.
(Sift cocoa through a fine strainer to remove any bits of chocolate
and it may be reused.)

Storage: Place truffles in a tin or plastic container with a
tight-fitting cover and keep at a cool room temperature for up to a
week.

Yield: About 35 to 50 truffles, depending on size
