Put the fruit in a heavy sauce pan and cover the fruit with cool
water. Now place the pan on high heat. Once it comes to a boil,
drain. Put the fruit in a bowl of ice water and allow to cool. Now
remove the fruit from the ice water and set it aside on a towel.

Place the fruit on a cutting board and trim off both ends of the
fruit.

In a small saucepan mix together the sugar and orange juice. Bring to
a boil over medium high heat. Lower the heat to a simmer. Skim as
necessary and add the fruit. Simmer 50-60 minutes, stirring
occasionally to make sure the fruit is not sticking to the bottom.
Take the fruit out and separate on a plate lined with parchment
paper. Reserve and use as desired.

For the graham cracker/nut pie crust:

Combine all of the above ingredients together in a bowl. Now press
them firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch pie pan.

Filling: Whip the egg yolks until thick and pale yellow (about 5
minutes). Pour in the condensed milk and the kumquats. Slowly add in
the key lime juice. Pour into the pie crust and bake 10-12 minutes.

Cool for 1 hour and then chill completely. Serve as desired.

Yield: 1- 10-inch pie
