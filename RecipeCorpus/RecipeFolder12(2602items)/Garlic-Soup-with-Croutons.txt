Title: Garlic Soup with Croutons
Categories: Emeril, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Thinly sliced yellow onions
1/2 c  Whole peeled garlic cloves
(about 16 to 20 cloves)
3    Bay leaves
2 1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper
2 qt White chicken stock
2 tb Minced fresh garlic
1 ts Chopped fresh basil
1 ts Chopped fresh thyme
2 c  Torn or coarsely chopped
Day-old French or Italian
Bread
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/3 c  Fresh, coarsely grated
Parmesan cheese
1 c  Spicy homemade* or prepared
Croutons
Heat oil in a soup pot over high heat and add onions, garlic cloves,
bay leaves, salt, and 7 turns of pepper.  Cook, stirring frequently,
until onions are caramelized, about 7 minutes.  Don't let onions get
too dark; they should be sweet-tasting and a rich golden-brown color.

Stir in stock, minced garlic, basil and thyme and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium and simmer about 40 minutes.

Turn heat back up to high, whisk in bread and cream and continue
whisking until bread has disintegrated into the soup, about 10
minutes. Whisk in Parmesan and remove from heat.  Puree soup in a
food processor or blender; do this in batches, if necessary.

To serve, allow 1 generous cup per portion topped with croutons.

Yield:  5 1/2 cups/4 servings

seasoning, or to taste.
