Title: Blue Corn Tortilla Stack
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Salsa de Chile Colorado
12    Blue corn tortillas
Vegetable oil
2 c  Diced, cooked chicken
2 c  Grated Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 c  Pine nuts toasted
Cilantro, finely diced
1/2    Red onion, diced
12    Limes, cut into wedges
Make the Salsa de Chile Colorado:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a mediumsize skillet, over a medium heat, fry each tortilla in a
little of the oil until just cooked, but not crisp. Dip each
tortilla, as you build the stacks, quickly into the Salsa de Chile
Colorado, just to moisten.

In an ovenproof baking dish large enough to hold 4 of the blue corn
tortillas, side by side without touching, place the first 4 tortillas.

Top each tortilla with 1/4 cup of the cooked chicken. Top the chicken
with 1/4 cup of the grated cheese. Sprinkle the cheese with 1
teaspoon of the pine nuts and 1 teaspoon of the cilantro. Repeat
layering 4 tortillas, 1/4 cup chicken, 1/4 cup cheese, 1 teaspoon
pine nuts, and 1 teaspoon cilantro and finally top with the last 4
tortillas. You should have 4 stacks.

Pour the remaining Salsa de Chile Colorado over all the stacks.

Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer each stack to a plate,
garnish with the red onion and the lime wedges, and serve immediately.
