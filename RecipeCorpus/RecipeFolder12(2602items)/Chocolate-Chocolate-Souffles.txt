Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Butter, room temperature
1/2 c  Sugar
8 oz Semisweet chocolate, finely
Chopped
4 lg Egg whites
3 lg Egg yolks
1/4 c  Grand Marnier
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter 4 individual ramekins.
Sprinkle each ramekin with 1 teaspoon sugar.  In a large metal bowl,
set over a pot of simmering water, melt the chocolate, whisking it
occasionally. Remove the bowl from the heat.  In a mixing bowl, whisk
the egg whites with 1/4 cup of the sugar until stiff and glossy.
Whisk the egg yolks into the chocolate one at a time, add the Grand
Marnier, and whisk in the remaining sugar.  Fold in the egg whites
and blend until smooth. Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared
ramekins. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake until they
are puffed and somewhat firm, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the
oven and serve with the chocolate sauce and powdered sugar.
