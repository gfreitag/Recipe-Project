Title: Corn And Roasted Poblano Soup
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 qt Milk
2 tb Cumin seeds
2    Bay leaves
Sprig of fresh rosemary or
1/2 ts Dried
1/4 c  Olive oil or 4 tablespoons
Unsalted butter
2 lg Onions, diced
2 ts Salt
4    To 6 garlic cloves, minced
2 ts Ground cumin
8 c  Fresh or canned corn
Kernels
6    Poblano chiles, roasted,
Peeled, seeded and diced
(see Note)
1 bn Chives, thinly sliced on the
Diagonal, for garnish
Combine the milk, cumin seeds, bay leaves and rosemary in a medium
saucepan. Place over low heat and bring nearly to a simmer. (Do not
boil.) Remove from the heat and let sit 20 minutes to infuse.

Heat the olive oil or butter in a large saucepan or stockpot over
medium heat. Cook the onions with the salt until golden brown, 15 to
20 minutes. Add the garlic and ground cumin and cook, stirring
frequently, 5 minutes. Then stir in the corn kernels and diced chiles
and continue cooking over low heat 5 more minutes.

Using your finest strainer, strain the infused herbal milk into the
corn and chile mixture. Bring to a very slow simmer over low heat.
Gently simmer
15    minutes.

Pour one third of the soup into a food processor or blender and
puree. Stir back into the soup pot. Serve hot with the chives as
garnish.

Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame
or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly
charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer the
charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam
until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. (If you are rushed, you
can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The
best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and
then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits.
Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away
flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins.
