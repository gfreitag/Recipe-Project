Title: Citrus-Savory Caramel Sauce
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 3/4 c  Light or dark chicken stock
2/3 c  Fresh grapefruit juice
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 ts Light soy sauce
Combine the stock, grapefruit juice, and sugar in a shallow
heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook to the caramel stage; there will be
wisps of smoke coming from the center of the pan. Carefully whisk in
the cream. Allow the mixture to boil and deepen in color. Reduce the
mixture to 1 or 1 1/2 cups, whisking constantly. When it is
caramel-dark, add the soy sauce. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer
and reserve.

Yield: 1 to 1-1/2 cups
