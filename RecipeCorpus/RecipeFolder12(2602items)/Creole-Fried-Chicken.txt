1    Whole chicken (about 5

2    Eggs, beaten

Season the chicken with Essence. Smear the mustard over each piece of
chicken thoroughly. Season the flour with Essence. Whisk the eggs and
milk together. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Fill a large
skillet up half way with the oil. Preheat the oil. Dredge the chicken
pieces in the season flour. Dip each piece in the egg wash, letting
the excess drip off. Dredge the chicken again in the seasoned flour,
coating the chicken completely. When the oil is hot, pan-fry the
chicken until golden brown, about 6 minutes on each side. Remove the
chicken from the oil and drain on paper towels. Season the chicken
with Essence. Serve the chicken warm.
