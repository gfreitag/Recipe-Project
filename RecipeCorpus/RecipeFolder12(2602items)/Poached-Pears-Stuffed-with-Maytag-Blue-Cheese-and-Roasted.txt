WINE REDUCTION SAUCE
For Port Wine Reduction 1 quart Port Wine 1 cup chopped basic
mirepoix 1 cup crumbled Maytag Blue Cheese 1 cup chopped roasted
walnuts 4 poached pears, cored from the bottom leaving the stem
intact 2 prepared puff pastry sheets 8 x 10 inches, split in half Egg
wash--1 egg mixed with 1 teaspoon water
1/2    cup roasted walnut pieces
1/2    cup snipped chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For Port Wine Reduction:  Combine the
port with the mirepoix and reduce by 2/3 to a syrup consistency,about
6 to 8 minutes.

For stuffed pears:  Combine the blue cheese and walnuts together.
Stuff each pear with 1/4 of the mixture.  Place a pear in the center
of the halved puff pastry sheet and wrap like a bundle, trimming any
excess, thus leaving the shape of the pear evident.  Brush each pear
with the egg wash and bake until golden, about 8-10 minutes.

To assemble, place the pear in the center of the plate, drizzle with
the Port Wine Reduction, sprinkle with the walnuts and chives.
