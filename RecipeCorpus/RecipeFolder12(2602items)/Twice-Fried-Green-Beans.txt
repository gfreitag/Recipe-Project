Title: Twice Fried Green Beans
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Green beans
3 c  Peanut oil for deep-frying,
Plus 3 tablespoons for
Stirfrying
2    Scallions, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
2 tb Minced soaked dried shrimp
2 tb Water
1 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
Heat 3 cups of the peanut oil in a large pot to deep-fry temperature
(350 degrees F), and fry the beans in batches until tender but still
crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer beans to paper
towels to drain.

Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a wok or large skillet. Add
the scallions and garlic and cook just long enough to release the
aromas, about 1 minute. Add the shrimp and green beans and mix well
to coat the beans. Stir in the water, soy sauce, sugar, salt and
pepper, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, tossing to heat through.
Serve immediately.
