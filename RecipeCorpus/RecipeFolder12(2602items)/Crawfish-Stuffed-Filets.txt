Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Olive oil, in all
1 ts Finely minced onions
1 ts Finely minced green onions
1 ts Finely minced celery
1 ts Finely minced red onions
2 ts Minced shallots
1 ts Minced garlic
1/4 lb Crawfish tails
2 tb Shrimp stock
2 tb Bread crumbs
1 tb Essence, in all
4    Filet mignons (6-7 ounces
Each), trimmed
1 c  Mashed potatoes
1 tb Shaved chives
Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil, over high heat. Saute the onions, green
onions, celery, red peppers, shallots, and garlic, for 1-2 minutes.
Add the crawfish tails, stock, bread crumbs, and 1 teaspoon of
Essence and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool
for at least 15 minutes. Using a small sharp knife, cut a slit about
2 inches long into the side of each steak and cut about 2 inches in
to make a pocket. Season the meat with the remaining Essence inside
and out of the pocket. Stand the steaks of their uncut edges and open
the pockets. Using a spoon, fill each pocket with 1/4 cup of the
stuffing. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a saute pan over
high heat. When the pan begins to smoke, add the filets and saute for
3-4 minutes on each side for medium rare.
