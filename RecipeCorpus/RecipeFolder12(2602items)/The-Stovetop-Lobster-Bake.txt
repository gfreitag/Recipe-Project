Title: The Stovetop Lobster Bake
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Seaweed
2    Dozen little neck clams
3 lb New potatoes
8    Ears corn
2 lb Small white onions
2 lb Chorizo sausage
3 lb Mussels
6    (1 pound) lobsters
Drawn butter
Cayenne pepper
Coarse salt
Lemons
Hot sauce
1 lg Enamel lobster pot
Preferably 24 quart size
Cheesecloth
Wash the shellfish in fresh water. Wash the potatoes, peel (but leave
whole) the onions, pull back the husk from the corn, remove the silk
and wrap the corn again in husks. Wrap each food item separately into
a small bundle of cheesecloth so that it can more easily be retrieved
from the hot and steamy pot.

Put the lobster pot on the stove, line the bottom with a layer of
seaweed and pour in 2 cups water. Place the bundle of clams and
potatoes on this first layer of seaweed. Place a layer of seaweed
over the first 2 cheesecloth bundles. Lay the bundles of corn and
clams on the seaweed layer and top them with yet another seaweed
layer. Put the sausage and mussel packages into the pot and layer
some seaweed over them. End with a layer of lobster, neatly tucked
into the pot and covered with seaweed. If the lobstesr rise above the
top edge of the pot, cover them with a towel, tucking the edges into
the rim of the pot. Set the heat on medium and begin cooking the
lobster bake. When the lobster have cooked completely, about 45 to 60
minutes, the other ingredients of the bake should be cooked as well.
Serve the bake with all the condiments on the side along with hot
cornbread.

Yield: 6 to 8 portions
