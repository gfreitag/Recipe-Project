Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6 ea Semi boneless quail
1 c  Quail marinade
1 c  Port vinaigrette
9 oz Lettuce mix (arugula, red
Mustard, tatsoi, red kale,
Baby bok choy)
1 tb Orange zest
1    2 ounce pomegranate
Molasses
1    2 ounce port glaze - place
In plastic squirt bottle
4 tb Chopped mix herbs - parsley,
Thyme, tarragon, basil
Salt and pepper - to taste
Marinate the quail for at least 4-6 hours. Remove from marinade and
season with salt and pepper. In a hot saute pan sear the quail breast
down until golden brown. Flip the quail onto their backs and place in
a hot oven.

In another large saute pan heat the port vinaigrette. Add the greens
and orange zest and lightly wilt. Season with salt and pepper.

Turn quail back onto their breasts to finish cooking. In the center
of the plate arrange a mound of the wilted greens and a heaping
spoonful of the chickpea salad. Pull the quail out of the oven and
allow to rest on their backs. Brush them with pomegranate molasses.
Cut the quail in half and place on top. From a squirt bottle squiggle
a design of the port glaze over the whole plate. Sprinkle over the
chopped herbs.
