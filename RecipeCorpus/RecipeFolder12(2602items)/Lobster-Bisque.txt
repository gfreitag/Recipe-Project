Title: Lobster Bisque
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Unsalted butter
12    Shallots, thinly sliced
12    Mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 c  Brandy
1 c  Madeira
6 c  Lobster stock
Beurre Manie:
1 tb Softened, unsalted butter
2 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/4 ts Fresh lemon juice
ds Tabasco pepper sauce
Melt butter in a large stockpot over mediumhigh heat. Saute shallots
until golden, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook over high heat
until slightly browned, about 2 additional minutes.

Remove from heat and add brandy and Madeira reserving 1/4 cup of each
for final seasoning. Cook over high heat until liquid is reduced by
half. Add lobster stock and return to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and
cook, uncovered, 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the strength of your
stock. (Weaker stocks need to cook longer to concentrate their
flavors.) Occasionally skim and discard foam that rises to the top.

Make beurre manie by mixing butter and flour with your fingers to
form a smooth paste. Press onto ends of a whisk.

When broth has a strong, almost salty, lobster flavor, add cream and
bring it back to a boil, skimming foam occasionally. Then whisk in
beurre manie until dissolved. Cook an additional 5 minutes over high
heat, whisking occasionally.

Strain through a fine sieve, pressing with the back of a ladle to
extract all juices. Season with lemon juice, reserved brandy and
Madeira, and Tabasco pepper sauce, and serve immediately.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings
