10-inch tart pan. Chill the dough several hours, or overnight.

Peel, core, halve and slice the apples 1/8-inch thick; arrange on
pastry, overlapping. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. For custard,
combine all ingredients; whisk by hand until smooth and well blended;
strain and reserve.

Bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes or until apples and crust are

careful not to let it overflow. Return tart to oven for 5 to 10
minutes or until custard is set, but not colored or puffed.
