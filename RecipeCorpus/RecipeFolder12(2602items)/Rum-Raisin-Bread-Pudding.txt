Categories: Toohot, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Short grain white rice
4 c  Nonfat milk
4    Sticks cinnamon
1 cn Sweetened condensed milk
1    Vanilla bean, split and
Scraped
3/4 c  Dark rum
1 c  Golden raisins
Wash rice under cold running water until water runs clear and drain
well. Bring milk to a boil with cinnamon sticks, add rice, return to
a boil then reduce to a simmer.  Cook 12-15 minutes or until just
barely soft throughout, stirring occasionally.  Add sweetened
condensed milk and vanilla bean and continue to simmer very slowly
covered for 10-15 additional minutes or until rice is plump and
tender and sauce is the consistency of heavy cream.  Chill in a bowl
over ice water to stop cooking.

Place rum and raisins in a heavy bottomed pot and simmer over low heat
until raisins have plumped and rum is almost gone.  Set aside to cool
and fold into chilled rice pudding.  Serve icy cold with a dusting of
cinnamon atop.
