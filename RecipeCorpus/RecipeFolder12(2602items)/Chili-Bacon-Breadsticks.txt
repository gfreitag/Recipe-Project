Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Let bacon stand at room temperature to soften slightly, about 10
minutes. Wrap one bacon slice gently in a spiral around each
breadstick and arrange on a tray. Breadsticks may be wrapped 4 hours
ahead and chilled, covered.

In a shallow dish long enough to fit breadsticks stir together sugar
and chili powder until combined well, pressing out any lumps with the
back of a fork. Alternatively, sugar mixture may be forced through a
small sieve into a bowl and returned to dish.

Roll each breadstick gently in mixture, coating bacon well, and
arrange about 1/2-inch apart on rack of a broiler pan.

Bake breadsticks 20 minutes, or until coating is caramelized and
bacon is deep golden. Loosen breadsticks gently from rack with a
metal spatula and cool until firm enough to pick up, 10 to 15
minutes. Bacon will become crisp and breadsticks will harden as they
cool.

Serve breadsticks at room temperature.

Yield: 30 hors d'oeuvres
