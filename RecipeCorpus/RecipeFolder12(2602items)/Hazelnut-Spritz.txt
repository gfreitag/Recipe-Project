Title: Hazelnut Spritz
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Hazelnuts or filberts,
Toasted
1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
Room temperature
1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  All-purpose flour
Chocolate Frosting:
1/2 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 tb Heavy cream
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cover two baking sheets with
parchment paper. A plain baking sheet need not be greased.

Put the nuts into the food processor and grind them until very fine.
In a large bowl, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla with an electric
mixer until light. Add the ground nuts and flour. Mix until smooth.
Put the dough into a cookie press with a star or ridged tip and press
into long, narrow strips. Cut into 4-inch pieces. Shape the strips
into rings and place on the baking sheet.

Bake for 10 minutes, just until lightly browned. Slide baked cookies
on the parchment off the baking sheet onto the countertop to cool, or
place onto a wire rack to cool.

While the cookies bake, combine the chocolate chips and cream in a
small glass bowl. Microwave at high power 1 minute at a time, or
place over simmering water, stirring until melted. Dip cooled cookies
in the chocolate so that ends are coated by 1/2 inch. Place on the
parchment or on waxed paper to harden.

Yield: 5 dozen cookie
