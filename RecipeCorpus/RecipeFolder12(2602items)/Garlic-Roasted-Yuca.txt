Title: Garlic Roasted Yuca
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Yuca
Water to cover with 1 1/2
ts Salt added
1 tb Ground cumin
1 ts Ground black pepper
1/4 lb Smoked bacon, coarsely
Chopped
2 tb Olive oil
4    Cloves garlic, peeled,
Thinly sliced
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1/4 c  Chopped almonds
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cut the yuca into 3 inch pieces, peel off the brown skin with a sharp
paring knife and discard. Cut the yuca in half and set aside in a
bowl of cold water. Fill a pot with enough cold water to cover the
yuca and bring to a boil. Add the salt to the water, add the yuca to
the pot and return to a boil. Cook the yuca for 15 minutes to soften.
Drain and cool for several minutes before handling. With a sharp
knife remove any thick fibers from the center of the yuca. Place the
yuca into a vegetable roasting dish and sprinkle evenly with the
cumin and the black pepper.

Cut the bacon coarsely and place in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook
the bacon until the fat has been rendered and the bacon is crisp.
Remove the bacon and set aside. To the bacon fat add the olive oil
and warm slowly, before adding the sliced garlic. Toast the garlic to
a pale golden brown before pouring the garlic and oil over the yuca
in the roasting dish. Add the cooked bacon to the yuca and, with a
spoon, stir to combine evenly.

Combine the bread crumbs with the chopped nuts and sprinkle on top of
the yuca. Place the dish into the oven and roast for 25 minutes or
until the top is browned and crisp.
