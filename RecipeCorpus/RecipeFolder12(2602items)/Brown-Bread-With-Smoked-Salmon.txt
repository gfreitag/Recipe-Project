in the sour milk vigorously to make a thickish dough.  Turn dough out

and 7 inches in diameter.  Warm an 8inch cast iron skillet or cake
pan in the oven for 3 minutes.  Take it out, grease and flour it, and
place the round dough @cake? in the pan.  Using a wet paring knife,
make a cross cut on the top of the dough.  Cover the pan and bake in
the oven for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and wrap bread in a
clean tea towel to cool, 5 to 6 hours. Serve with smoked salmon and
cream cheese.
