Title: Tempering White Chocolate
Categories: Emeril, Help
Yield: 2 Servings
2 lb Block white chocolate
**Very important-do not let any moisture come in contact with the
chocolate.

Using a French knife, chop the chocolate into small pieces.  Place the
chocolate in a stainless mixing bowl.  Set the bowl over a pan of warm
water.  Stir the chocolate constantly so that it melts uniformly.
Continue stirring the chocolate until is completely melted and
reaches a temperature of 115 to 118 degrees F. **Remember that your
body temperature is 98.6 degrees F. So the chocolate is ready if it
fells a little warm than your body-Who really has candy thermometers
laying around. Remove the bowl from the water bath Set in a cool
place and stir the chocolate slowly by constantly until it is cool,
78 to 79 degrees F. It should be thick and pasty in texture. Set the
chocolate over the warm water again and stir it until is warmed to 86
to 88 degrees F. Be very careful, because the chocolate warms very
quickly.  Do not let the chocolate get too warm.
