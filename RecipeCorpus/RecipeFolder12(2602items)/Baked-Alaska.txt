Title: Baked Alaska
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1/2    Sheet cake of vanilla sponge
Cake
1 pt Chocolate chip ice cream
1 pt Coffee ice cream
4    Egg whites
2 tb Sugar
1/2 x  A clean egg shell
1/4 c  Armagnac
Cut the sheet cake into fourths. Spread the chocolate chip ice cream
evenly on one layer of the sponge cake. Top the chocolate chip ice
cream with the second piece of sponge cake. Spread the coffee ice
cream evenly on top of the sponge cake. Lay the third piece of sponge
cake directly on top of the praline ice cream. Lay the final piece of
sponge cake on top of the praline ice cream. Wrap the cake tightly
with plastic wrap and place in the freezer. Freeze the cake until
firm, about 2 hours. Using an electric mixer, with a whip attachment,
whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the sugar and whip to
stiff peaks. Remove the cake from the freezer. Cut a small hole in
the center of the cake about 2 inches deep and 2 inches wide. Fill
the egg shell with Armagnac. Place the shell in the cake hole. With a
rubber spatula, spread the egg whites evenly over the entire cake,
except for the shell. With a small blow torch, torch the cake until
golden brown. Slice the cake and serve with a drizzle of chocolate
sauce.

RAW EGG WARNING

The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against
consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may
be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of
food poisoning....Healthy people need to remember that there is a
very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods
accordingly. Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled,
fresh, grade AA or A eggs. Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the
shell."
