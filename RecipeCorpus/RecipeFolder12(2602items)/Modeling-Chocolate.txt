Title: Modeling Chocolate
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
16 oz Semisweet chocolate (use
Chips or break blocks into
sm Pieces)
5 oz Light corn syrup
Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a sauce pan of hot but not boiling
water. Stir in the corn syrup; the chocolate will start to stiffen
almost immediately. Stir until the ingredients are completely
combined. Wrap in plastic until cool.

The paste will seem hard, but it will soften from the warmth of your
hands when you start to work with it. Roll it out with a rolling pin,
or run it through a pasta machine starting at the widest opening,
then through smaller openings until it reaches the thickness you want.

Yield: 1 serving
