Title: Blintz Wrapup And Cooking
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Shaped blintzes of choice
Butter for frying, optional
Spoon a tablespoon of filling in the center of each pancake.  Fold
both sides in towards the middle and roll up into a rectangular shape.

Melt enough butter in a skillet so blintzes float slightly over the
butter. Fry the blintzes slowly on one side until golden brown, then
turn and fry on the second side.

If the blintzes are frozen, don't thaw them.  Fry them frozen, but
keep the heat very low, cover the pan for the first 7 to 8 minutes,
then turn them over and fry uncovered on the second side.

To bake, set them on a baking sheet and bake in a 425 degree oven
until golden brown.

FINISHING TOUCHES

Serve cheese or fruit filled ones with sour cream or jam.  Serve
savory ones according to what it goes with them.  Like some sour
cream and chopped cilantro for the meat filled one.  Serve with a
light fresh tomato vinaigrette for the cheese and herb ones or serve
these alongside a steamed green vegetable.
