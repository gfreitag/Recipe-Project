Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Ground pork
4 tb Butter
3 tb Plus 3/4 cup flour
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1/4 c  Chopped bell peppers
2 tb Minced garlic
1 1/2 c  Water
Salt and cayenne
2 c  Cooked medium-grain rice
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
Tabasco to taste
2 c  Fine bread crumbs
Essence
1    Egg, beaten
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Creole Mustard Aioli
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
1 tb Burnoose red pepper
In a saute pan, brown the pork for about 3-4 minutes.  Remove from
the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate.  In a large saute pan, melt
the butter. Add 3 tablespoons of flour, stirring constantly for a
brown roux. Add the onions, peppers and garlic and continue to saute
for 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables wilt.  Add the pork and
sautÂ‚ for 3 minutes. Stir in the water.  Season the mixture with salt
and pepper. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
Cook the mixture for 45 minutes. Stir in the rice and green onions,
Tabasco, and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs. Remove from the heat and
cool for 20 minutes.  Season the flour and remaining bread crumbs
with Essence, separately.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg and
milk together.  Season the mixture with Essence. Shape the pork/rice
mixture into balls the size of walnuts. Dredge the balls in the
flour.  Dip each ball in the egg wash, letting any excess drip off.
Dredge the balls in the bread crumbs. Fry the roulettes a couple at a
time until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Remove the boulettes from
the fryer and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with Essence.
Spoon the Aioli in the center of the plate and around the rim.  Mound
the boulettes in the center of the sauce.  Garnish with the grated
cheese, parsley and peppers.
