pans. Melt chocolate in double boiler and set aside to cool. Drain
beets and pure in a blender or food processor; you should have 1 cup.
Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.

In a bowl with an electric mixer beat butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla
until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in chocolate. With
mixer on low alternately beat in flour mixture (in fourths) and
buttermilk mixed with vinegar (in thirds), beginning and ending with
flour. Beat until incorporated. Add pured beets and mix on medium
until blended. Divide the batter between the pans. Bake for 30 to 35
minutes, or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean and
top of cake springs back when lightly pressed. Cool cakes in pans on
wire racks for 10 minutes and invert onto racks to cool completely.

Make frosting: In a bowl set over a large saucepan of simmering water
beat sugar, cream of tartar, salt, egg whites and water with mixer
for 5 to 7 minutes, or until mixture holds stiff peaks. Remove bowl
from pan and beat icing for 3 minutes more. Beat in vanilla.

To assemble cake: On serving plate spread one cake layer with a third
of frosting and top with second layer. Spread remaining frosting over
top and sides.
