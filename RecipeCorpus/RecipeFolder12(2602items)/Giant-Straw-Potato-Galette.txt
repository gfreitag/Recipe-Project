Title: Giant Straw Potato Galette
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
6 md Potatoes, preferably
"baking", peeled and soaking
In water
6 tb Or more clarified butter
Salt and pepper
Using a mandoline, cut the potatoes into matchstick sized pieces. Dry
the potatoes with a cloth towel. As soon as the potatoes are cut and
dry, film the frying pan with a 1/16 layer of clarified butter, and
heat to very hot but not browning. Turn in the potatoes, making a
layer about 3/8-inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and 2 or 3
spoonfuls more butter, then press them down firmly all over with the
spatula so they will flatten as they cook. Frequently press them down
white they slowly brown on the bottom, and shake pan gently by its
handle to be sure potatoes are not sticking to the pan. When browned,
in 2 to 3 minutes, cover the pan and lower heat to moderate. Cook for
6 to 8 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender on top, but watch
they do not burn on the bottom. Press them down again, and the
galette is ready to brown on its other side. To turn it: either slide
it out onto an oiled baking sheet, turn the frying pan upside down
over it, and reverse the two so the galette drops into the pan,
browned side up; or flip the galette in its pan, which, of course, is
much more fun and faster.
