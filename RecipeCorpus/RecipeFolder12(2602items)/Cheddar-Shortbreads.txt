Title: Cheddar Shortbreads
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter
4 oz Sharp cheddar cheese, about
1    Cup, coarsely grated
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Hungarian paprika
1 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
Flour
10 1/2    By 15 1/2-inch jelly roll
Pans or 12 by 15 1/2-inch
Cookie sheets,
Lined with parchment paper
Set racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 350
degrees. Cut the butter in 10 or 12 pieces and place in the food
processor. Grate the cheese coarsely and add to the processor. Pulse
until well mixed but be careful not to overmix and soften the butter
too much. Add the salt, mustard and paprika and pulse to mix them in.
Add the flour to the processor and pulse until the butter and cheese
have absorbed all the flour. Remove the dough from the bowl to a
lightly floured work surface and press it together. Roll dough on a
floured surface and cut into 2-inch disks or squares. Arrange about
an inch apart on prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees about 15 minutes,
until pale golden. Remove and cool on a rack.

Yield: 36 cookies
