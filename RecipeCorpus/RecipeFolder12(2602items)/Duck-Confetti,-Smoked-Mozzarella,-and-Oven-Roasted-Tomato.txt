1    (12-inch) pizza dough
2 c  Fresh basil
1 tb Minced garlic
1/2 c  Roasted pine nuts
1/2 c  Grated Parigiano-Reggiano

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place the baking stones in the oven.
Using a food processor with the metal blade, combine the basil,
garlic, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese. Puree the mixture until
smooth. With the motor running, slowly drizzle 1/2 cup of the olive
oil through the feed tube and puree until smooth. (Add additional
olive oil if needed) Season the pesto with salt and pepper. Remove
from the food processor and set aside. To assemble, spread an even
layer of the pesto on top of the dough. Layer the cheese over the
sauce. Sprinkle the duck confit and tomatoes over the cheese. Place
in the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 15-20
minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven. Place the pizza on a cutting
board and slice the pizza.
