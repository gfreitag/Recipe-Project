Title: Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Milk
Seeds scraped from one
Vanilla bean
8    Yolks
3/4 c  Sugar
6 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Butter, softened
In a 3 quart saucepot combine the milk and vanilla bean seeds.
Combine the yolks and sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted
with the whisk attachment.  Sift the cornstarch onto a piece of wax
or parchment paper. Scald the milk.  Meanwhile, beat the yolks and
sugar until they lighten in color.  Remove the bowl from the mixer
and stir in the cornstarch. Pour about 1/3 of the hot milk into the
egg mixture, whisking continuously to incorporate.  Whisk the
tempered egg mixture back into the remaining hot milk, and place the
pot back on the heat. Cook on medium high heat, stirring constantly
but gently with the whisk, until the mixture comes to the boil.
Reduce heat and let it boil for about 30 seconds, stirring
constantly.  Remove from heat and gently whisk in the butter. Strain
the pastry cream into a bowl, place plastic wrap right down on the
surface, and chill completely. This can be made up to 3 days ahead.

Yield: about 3 1/2 cups
