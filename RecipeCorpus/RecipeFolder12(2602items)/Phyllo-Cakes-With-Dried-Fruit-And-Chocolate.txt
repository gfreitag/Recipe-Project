Title: Phyllo Cakes With Dried Fruit And Chocolate
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
2 oz Bittersweet chocolate
2/3 c  Walnut pieces
1 oz Dried apricots
1 oz Dried figs
1 pk Phyllo dough
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Melt the butter. Chop the chocolate,
apricots and figs by hand with a large knife. Mix them in a bowl with
the walnuts. Unwrap the phyllo and lay one sheet on the work surface.
Brush it lightly with melted butter. Add another phyllo sheet,
brushing it with butter. Continue until you have 4 layers. Butter a
baking sheet. Cut four 6 inch squares from the phyllo dough. Spoon a
quarter of the filling in the center of each square. To shape each
galette: pull in the corners of the square to cover the filling
completely. Flip the galette, and flatten it, shaping it in a round
like a hamburger. Set the galettes on the baking sheet and brush them
with butter.

Loosely roll dough trimmings, twist into 4 roses and set on the baking
sheet. Bake in the heated oven until crisp and brown, allowing 12 to
15 minutes for the roses and 20 to 25 minutes for the galettes.
Transfer the pastries to a rack to cool. Sprinkle with powdered
sugar, topping each galette with a pastry rose. The galettes may be
served warm or cool.
