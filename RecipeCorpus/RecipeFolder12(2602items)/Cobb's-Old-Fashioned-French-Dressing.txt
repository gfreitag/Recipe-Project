Title: Cobb's Old Fashioned French Dressing
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Water
1 c  Red wine vinegar
1 ts Sugar
Juice of one lemon
1 tb Salt
1 tb Ground black pepper
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Dry English mustard
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 c  Olive oil
3 c  Salad oil
Blend together all ingredients except the oils. Using a whisk or food
processor, combine the oils and add them in a very fine stream,
continuing to whisk until the mixture is well combined. Chill and
shake thoroughly before serving.

Note: This dressing can be varied in numerous ways. Fresh dill,
tarragon, or rosemary can be added. This can be used as a base for
Ranch, Caesar or Thousand Island dressings; it is also a marvelous
marinade for vegetables, meats, or fish that are to be broiled or
grilled.

Suggested Drink: Red Tail Ale
