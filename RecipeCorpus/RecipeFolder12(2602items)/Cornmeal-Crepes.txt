Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2    Serrano chiles, stemmed and
Seeded and chopped
1/2 bn Cilantro, chopped
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Milk
2 ts Coarse salt
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Flour
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Vegetable oil
In a blender, place the chiles and cilantro. Add the eggs, water,
milk, salt, baking powder, cornmeal, flour, sugar, and oil. Blend
until very smooth. Let the batter rest at room temperature 30 minutes
to 1 hour.

Heat an 8 to 9inch, wellseasoned crepe pan or small skillet over a
medium heat. Coat with a little vegetable oil. When the pan is hot,
pour in about 2 to 3 ounces of the crepe batter. Tilt the pan,
rotating so the batter is evenly distributed. Cook until the crepe
appears dry, then turn and cook on the other side. Repeat until all
the batter is used. Store the crepes between sheets of wax paper
until ready to use.
