Title: Buffalo Eggs
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 sl Dense sandwich bread
1 tb Butter
1    Egg
Salt and pepper to taste
Use a cookie cutter or glass to cut out a 2 inch circle in the center
of the slice of bread.  Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium
heat. Add 2 teaspoons butter.  When butter has melted and is foamy,
place the slice of bread in the pan.  Cook for 1 minute until golden.
Flip the piece of bread over, drop the remaining 1 teaspoon butter in
the hole, and when the butter has completely melted, crack the egg
into the hole. The white will run under and the yolk will sit in the
hole. Cook over medium heat 13 minutes until as set as desired. If
you wish a drier egg, you can flip the toast back over to lightly
cook the top of the yolk. Serve hot.

Yield: One serving

You can make more than one portion at a time on the flat surface of a
griddle.
