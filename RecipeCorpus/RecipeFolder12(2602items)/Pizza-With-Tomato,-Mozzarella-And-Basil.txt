Title: Pizza With Tomato, Mozzarella And Basil
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Olive oil
1    Clove garlic, finely
Chopped
2 c  Canned plum tomatoes,
Crushed by hand, seeds
Removed
1/2 ts Salt and pepper
1 ts Dry oregano
2    12-inch pizza crusts
4 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella, thinly
Sliced
8    Basil leaves
Ceramic pizza stone
Pizza peel
Set the pizza stone into a cold oven and preheat the oven to 450
degrees.

In a small sauce pan set over a low flame, heat 1 tablespoon of olive
oil. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute before adding the tomatoes.
Season the tomatoes with the salt, pepper and oregano and cook over
medium heat for 10 minutes.

Working on a lightly floured surface, pat one of the pizza dough
balls into a flat round shape, working from the center outward. While
forming the shape of a pizza crust, work with the tips of the fingers
and form a 1/2-inch thick edge.  Continue to work outward trying to
achieve as even a thickness as possible.

When the pizza dough is formed into shape transfer the dough to the
peel and drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the surface. Sprinkle
half the Parmesan cheese evenly over the oiled pizza dough and spoon
3 tablespoons of sauce over the surface.  Evenly spread half of the
mozzarella over the tomato and finish building your pizza with a few
basil leaves roughly torn by hand.  Place the pizza onto the pizza
stone in the oven by sliding the pizza off of the peel and onto the
hot stone. Repeat the process for the second pizza. Bake for 15 to 20
minutes or until the surface is bubbling and the bottom of the crust
is well browned.
