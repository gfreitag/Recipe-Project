Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Small red potatoes
3/4    Stick (6 tablespoons)
Unsalted butter, softened
1/2 c  Sour cream
4 oz Goat cheese (preferably
Aged; about 1/2 cup), grated
If aged or
Forced through a grater if
Soft
2 lg Eggs
1 ts Fresh thyme leaves
Generously oil or butter a 9-inch square baking pan and line with a
14-by 8-inch piece parchment paper, allowing ends of paper to
overhang 2 opposite edges of pan. Press on paper to coat underside
with oil or butter and turn over, keeping ends of paper overhanging.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices and in a kettle of boiling
salted water cook until tender but not falling apart, about 8
minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and cool 15 minutes.

In a large bowl whisk together butter and sour cream until smooth and
whisk in goat cheese and eggs until combined well. Add potatoes,
tossing gently, and transfer mixture to baking pan. Smooth top with a
spatula, spreading potatoes evenly, and sprinkle with thyme. Bake
potato cake in middle of oven 35 minutes, or until top is golden, and
cool in pan on a rack. Potato cake may be made 2 days ahead and
chilled, covered.

Using parchment paper, lift potato cake from pan and transfer to a
cutting board. Cut cake into squares, discarding parchment, and serve
at room temperature.
