simmer, partially covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Strain, removing fat from

hours.

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and using cool, wet hands,
shape the matzoh mixture into eight balls about 1 1/2-inches in
diameter. Reduce the heat to simmering and gently add the matzoh
balls. Cover the pot and poach the matzoh balls in the barely
simmering water for 25 minutes.

Add matzoh balls to soup and serve.
