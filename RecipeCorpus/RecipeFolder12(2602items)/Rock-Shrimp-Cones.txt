Title: Rock Shrimp Cones
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Vegetable oil for frying
1 lb Rock shrimp
Essence
2 c  Buttermilk
1 c  Flour
1 c  Masa flour
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
3/4 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
1/4 c  Chopped celery
2 tb Prepared horseradish
3 tb Creole or whole-grain
Mustard
3 tb Prepared yellow mustard
3 tb Ketchup
3 tb Chopped parsley
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2    Pieces of parchment paper
Heat the oil in a large skillet. In a mixing bowl, season the shrimp
with Essence. Stir in the buttermilk and marinate the shrimp for 1
hour, under refrigeration. Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator
and drain completely. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and masa
together. Season the flours with Essence. Dredge the shrimp in the
seasoned flour. Place the shrimp in a wire basket and shake the
shrimp completely, to remove any excess flour. Carefully fry the
shrimp in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the
shrimp from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the
shrimp with salt and pepper. Combine all the remaining ingredients in
a food processor with a metal blade and process for 30. Place the
sauce in the refrigerator and chill completely. The sauce will keep
for several days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. To
assemble, cut the parchment paper in half and form the paper into a
cone-like shape. Fill each cone with the fried rock shrimp. Serve the
cones with the Remoulade sauce.
