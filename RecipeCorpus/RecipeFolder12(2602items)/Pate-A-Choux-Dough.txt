Title: Pate A Choux Dough
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
6 tb (3 ounces) unsalted butter
3/4 c  Water
1 c  All purpose flour
1/8 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
4    Eggs
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  In 2 quart pot, combine the butter and
water. On a piece of wax or parchment paper, sift together the flour,
salt and sugar.  Bring the water and butter to a rolling boil, remove
from heat and dump the flour mixture in all at once. Stir with a
wooden spoon or paddle to incorporate. Return the saucepot to high
heat and cook, stirring, for about one minute. The mixture will form
a ball and coat the pan with a thin film. Transfer the mixture to a
mixing bowl or standing mixer equipped with the paddle attachment.
Mix the dough for a minute or so, on low speed, to release some of
the heat.  Add the eggs, one at a time, completely incorporating each
one before adding the next. Fit a pastry bag with a round #5 tip and
fill with the warm dough. Line a heavy cookie sheet with parchment
paper and anchor it to the tray with a little dab of the dough at
each corner.  Pipe about forty to forty five 1 1/2-inch mounds about
2 inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for
10 to 15 minutes, until golden and puffed. Reduce heat to 350 degrees
and bake for another 10 minutes or until they are golden brown and
there are no droplets of moisture in the crevices.  Turn off oven and
leave the choux to dry for another 10 minutes.  Use when cool, or
freeze, wrapped in a plastic bag, for 2-3 months.

Yield: 40 to 45 cream puffs
