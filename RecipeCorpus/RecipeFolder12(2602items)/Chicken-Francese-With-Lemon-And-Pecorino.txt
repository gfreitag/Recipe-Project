Title: Chicken Francese With Lemon And Pecorino
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
Breast
2    Heaping tablespoons of
Finely grated Pecorino
Cheese
4 tb Very finely chopped parsley
1    Egg, beaten well
Flour for dredging
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Chicken stock
6    Thin, round slices of lemon,
Seeds removed
2 tb Butter
Cut the chicken breasts into 6 pieces of roughly equal size. Place the
pieces between sheets of waxed paper, and pound with a mallet until
they're thin. Season with salt and pepper. Place cheese and parsley
in a wide, shallow bowl. Slowly add the beaten egg, whisking until
it's smoothly incorporated. Place the flour on a wide plate. Dip the
pounded chicken in the egg mixture. Remove, letting excess egg drip
off. Place each cutlet in the flour, and coat lightly. Remove from
flour and hold them in a single layer.

Add the olive oil to a saute pan large enough to hold the 6 cutlets
in a single layer. Place over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot,
add the cutlets. Saute, turning once, until the cutlets are golden on
the outside, just cooked on the inside (about 2 minutes per side).
Remove the cutlets, and hold them in a single layer.

Spill the oil out of the saute pan. Return the pan to high heat. Add
the white wine, and reduce it to 2 tablespoons. Add the chicken stock
and the lemon slices. Boil for 5 minutes, then remove the lemon
slices. Keep boiling the sauce until it's reduced to 1/2 cup. Turn
heat to very low. Swirl in the butter until the sauce is thickened.
Add the reserved chicken, turning them until they are coated in
sauce. Divide cutlets among 2 plates, pour remaining sauce over them,
sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, and serve
immediately.
