Title: Grilled Vidalia Onion & Papaya Relish
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Vidalia or another sweet
Onion, peeled and cut
Crosswise into
1/2    -inch thick slices
1/4 c  Olive oil
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
1 tb Honey
2    Ripe papayas, peeled, seeded
And diced
1/2 c  Packed cilantro leaves,
Coarsely chopped
Prepare grill or heat grill pan on stove top. Soak wooden skewers in
water for 30 minutes.

Lay an onion slice on a flat work surface. Poke the skewer through
center of the 1/2-inch-thick side of the onion slice, carefully
pushing the skewer all the way through the onion slice and out the
other side. The skewer and onion should resemble something like a
lollipop. If the skewer is long enough push another onion slice onto
the skewer. Skewer the remaining onion slices in the same manner.
Brush onions on both sides with thin coats of oil and season
generously with salt and pepper. Grill the onions, flipping
occasionally, until browned and lightly charred, about 10 to 15
minutes. Remove to a platter and allow to cool.

In a large bowl whisk together the lime juice and honey until well
combined. Coarsely chop the grilled onions and add to the lime
mixture, tossing to coat. Add the diced papaya and chopped cilantro
and carefully stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
