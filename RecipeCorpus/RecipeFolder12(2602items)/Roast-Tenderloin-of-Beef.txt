Preheat oven to 525 degrees F. Pat meat dry. In a small bowl combine
rosemary, thyme, garlic, pepper and salt. Rub mixture onto meat and
arrange meat on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast meat for 45 to 50

cutting board and let rest, loosely covered, for 10 minutes.

Make the sauce: In a saucepan combine the shallots, 2/3 cup of the
Madeira, the thyme, rosemary and bay leaf and reduce the mixture to
1/3 cup. Add the stock and tomato paste and simmer, stirring
occasionally, for 20 minutes.

In a small bowl combine the remaining Madeira with the arrowroot until
smooth and whisk it into the sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes more, or
until lightly thickened. Keep warm. Before serving, strain into a
sauceboat.
