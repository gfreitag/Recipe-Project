Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Vegetable oil, for
Deep-frying
1 lb Large shrimp, peeled and
Deveined
1 ts Finely-minced ginger
1    Scallion, finely minced
1 tb Shao Hsing (Chinese rice
Wine)
1 1/2 tb Lard
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts MSG
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
10    To 12 slices white bread,
Crusts removed (such as
Wonder)
1    Egg, beaten, for sealing
About 1 cup sesame seeds,
For dipping
Coarse salt
In a deep-fryer heat oil to 365 degrees. In a food processor combine
next 9 ingredients; pure until a slightly chunky paste is formed.
Using a rolling pin, flatten bread, one slice at a time. Spread 1 to
2 tablespoons of shrimp paste evenly over bread, and roll up in a
tight cylinder; brush edge with a little beaten egg to seal and let
dry while you make more cylinders.

When all shrimp paste is used, cut each cylinder in thirds into small
logs. Dip both ends of each log into egg, then into sesame seeds.
Deep-fry logs, in batches, until golden-brown, about 2 to 3 minutes,
turning several times with a metal spoon. Using a slotted spoon,
remove shrimp toasts and drain on paper towels; keep warm while you
fry remaining batches. Sprinkle with coarse salt and serve
immediately.

Yield: Makes about 30
