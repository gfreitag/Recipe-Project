Title: Jazz Fest Crawfish Bread
Categories: Emeril, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Recipe Basic Bread Dough for
Stuffed Bread (see previous
Recipe)
1/2 lb Monterey or Pepper Jack
Cheese, cut in 1/4-inch dice
1 lb Cooked, peeled crawfish
Tails or shrimp, coarsely
Chopped
1 1/2 tb Creole seasoning
1    Egg, lightly beaten with 1
ts Water, for egg wash
Thoroughly butter a 9x5x4-inch loaf pan.  On a lightly floured work
surface, roll dough into a 9x15-inch rectangle, with short side
facing you. Leaving a 1-inch border, scatter dough evenly with diced
cheese. In a small bowl toss crawfish tails with Creole seasoning to
coat; sprinkle evenly over cheese.  Starting with side closest to
you, roll up dough into a log; brush edge with egg wash to seal.
Transfer to loaf pan, seam-side down, cover with a dish towel and
leave to proof until doubled, about 40 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Using a razor or serrated knife, make a
shallow slash down center of dough, lengthwise, and brush with egg
wash. Bake bread until brown and firm, about 30 minutes.  Let bread
cool in pan on a rack 20 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
