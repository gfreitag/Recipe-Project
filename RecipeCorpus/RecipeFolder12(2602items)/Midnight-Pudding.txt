Title: Midnight Pudding
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
Into 1/4-inch pieces
2 c  Half-and-half
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
4 lg Egg yolks
1 tb Cornstarch
4 oz White chocolate, chopped
Into 1/8-inch pieces
Bring on the night by melting the semisweet chocolate in the top half
of a double boiler over medium heat.  Stir the chocolate constantly
with a rubber spatula until it is completely melted and smooth, then
remove from the heat and set aside.  Heat the half-and-half, 1/4 cup
sugar, and the cocoa in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.
When hot, whisk to dissolve the sugar.  Bring to a boil.  While the
cream is heating, whisk the egg yolks, remaining sugar and cornstarch
in a medium bowl until slightly thickened and lemon-colored. Pour the
boiling half-and-half mixture slowly into the egg yolks and stir to
combine. Return the mixture to the saucepan and heat over medium-high
heat, stirring constantly, until it begins to boil and becomes quite
thick, about 30 seconds.  Remove the pan from the heat and transfer
the mixture to a large bowl.  Add the melted chocolate, then place
the bowl in ice water and stir the pudding until it is cold.  Fold
all but 2 tablespoons of chopped white chocolate into the pudding.
Portion 3/4 cup of the pudding into each of 4 dessert dishes and
sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining white chocolate over the top
of each.
