Title: Roasted Apple Fettuccini
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Fresh fettuccini pasta
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Minced shallots
2 ts Minced garlic
1 lb Roasted Granny Smith apples,
Cored and thinly sliced
Salt and white pepper
Calvados, for deglazing pan
2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta to the water and
cook until tender, about 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the water and
drain. In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter. Add
the shallots, garlic, and apples. Season with salt and pepper. Saute
for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and deglaze the pan with
the Calvados. Place the pan back over the heat and flame the apples,
shaking the pan constantly. After the flame has died, add the cream
and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and continue to
cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the pasta to the apple/cream mixture and
toss to evenly coat the pasta. Stir in the cheese. Season with salt
and pepper if needed. Mound the pasta in the center of each plate.
Place each veal chop directly on top of the pasta. Garnish with
parsley.
