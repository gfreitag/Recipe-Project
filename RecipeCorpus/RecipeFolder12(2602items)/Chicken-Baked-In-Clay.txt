Title: Chicken Baked In Clay
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3 1/2 lb Chicken
1    Sprig of fresh rosemary
4    Fresh sage leaves
2    Italian sweet sausage,
Removed from casing
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
20    Thin slices pancetta
3 lb Box of non-toxic pottery
Clay
Start by washing the chicken inside and out, drying the bird well.
Stuff the cavity of the bird with rosemary, sage, and sausage meat.
Season the bird with the salt and pepper, wrap the breast of chicken
with slices of pancetta. Carefully wrap the entire bird with a large
piece of parchment paper, being sure the bird is securely enclosed
and the paper has no holes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Roll the clay out between two pieces of plastic wrap, rolling out a
circle large enough to cover the chicken, remove the plastic. Place
the parchment wrapped bird in the center, breast side up and enclose
the clay around the bird, completely sealing the chicken in the clay.
Place the clay onto a baking sheet and place in the oven and bake for
1 hour and 10 minutes. Cooking in the clay will seal all the juices
and flavors.

When cooked remove the chicken from the oven, bring to the tables and
crack the clay open with a mallet or the blunt end of a knife. Peel
off the clay and unwrap the bird, carve the chicken, serving the
sausage meat with the chicken.
