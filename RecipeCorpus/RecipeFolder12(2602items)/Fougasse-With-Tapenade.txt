Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Dry yeast
1/3 c  Sugar
1 3/4 c  Lukewarm water
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil plus
1/4    Cup
5 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
4 tb Chopped fresh rosemary
Leaves
1/4 c  Grated hard goat's milk
Cheese
3 tb Sea salt
3 tb Roughly cracked black

1 c  Tapenade (basic recipe)
In a large mixing bowl from a standing electric mixer, stir together
yeast, sugar, water and oil until yeast dissolves. Allow to stand at
room temperature for 20 minutes. Mix together flour, rosemary and
grated cheese. Place mixing bowl on mixer with dough hook or paddle
and turn on low. Slowly add flour mixture until all is in and mix
until a firm, smooth dough is formed.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Pull dough out and knead 5 minutes. Place in a bowl rubbed with olive
oil and cover with a kitchen towel. Allow to stand in a warm place
until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down in bowl, remove and
knead 2 turns. Roll into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick and place
on an oiled cookie sheet. Poke uniform indentations into dough, brush
with oil and dust with sea salt and black pepper. Bake until dark
golden brown, or about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and serve with
tapenade.
