Title: Lemon Curd Anglaise Sauce
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4    Egg yolks
1/3 c  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Half and half
1/2    Vanilla bean, split or 1
ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Lemon curd, homemade or
Purchased
Combine the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl. Whip until light and
fluffy. Bring the half and half to the scalding point with the vanilla
bean, if used. Gradually pour the hot cream into the yolk mixture
while stirring rapidly.

Place the mixture over simmering water and heat slowly, stirring
constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Be
very careful not to get it hotter than 190 degrees or it will curdle.

Immediately pour the custard into another container and continue
stirring for a minute or so. Remove the vanilla bean and save for
another use, or stir in the vanilla extract. Set the sauce aside to
cool, stirring from time to time until cold.

Place lemon curd in a medium mixing bowl and whisk in 3 tablespoons of
creme anglaise, until a smooth consistency has been achieved. Fold in
remaining creme anglaise. Store covered and refrigerated. The sauce
will keep for about 3 days.
