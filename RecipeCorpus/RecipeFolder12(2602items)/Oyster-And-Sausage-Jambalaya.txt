brown over low heat, stirring constantly, 15 minutes. Add sausage and
seasoning mix, mix thoroughly and continue cooking, stirring
frequently, for 20 minutes. Add rice, raise heat to medium and cook 5
minutes, or until rice is lightly browned, stirring and scraping
sides and bottom of pot. Add tomatoes, stock and oysters and mix
gently. Raise heat to high, bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, 5
minutes. Cover pot, reduce heat to low and cook 40 minutes, stirring
gently every 5 to 10 minutes. If too dry, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water
after about 30 minutes. Uncover pot, raise heat to medium and allow
rice to dry out, about 10 minutes without stirring. Stir very gently,
so as not to break up oysters and serve immediately.
