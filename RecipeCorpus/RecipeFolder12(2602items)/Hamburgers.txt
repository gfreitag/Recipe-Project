12 oz Bottom chuck, boneless
12 oz Sirloin, boneless
6 oz Meat from short ribs (you
Will need about 3/4 pound of
Short ribs)
6 oz Filet mignon
Beef fat, as needed
Cut the meat into long chunks about 1 1/2-inch wide. Visually inspect
the chunks: if they appear to have less than 20 to 25 percent fat,
mix them with strips of beef fat (describe "braiding" technique).
Season well with salt and pepper.

In a meat grinder, grind together the boneless meats through a large
grinding blade (with holes of 3/8-inch). Grind again. Loosely shape
into 12 hamburgers.

If cooking indoors, heat a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Add 2
ounces of beef suet and let it melt. Add six burgers to the skillet
if they fit without crowding. Cook about 4 minutes on each side for
rare burgers, or longer if desired. Repeat in the same beef suet with
the remaining six burgers.

Yield: 12 hamburgers

24 ounces meat from chuck neck bones (you will need about 6 lbs of
bones)
