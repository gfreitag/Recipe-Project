Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
12 oz Raw bacon, diced
2 c  Onions, chopped
1/2 c  Celery, chopped
1/2 c  Bell peppers, chopped
1 md Eggplant, peeled and diced
3 tb Garlic, chopped
1 tb Fresh thyme, chopped
1 tb Finely parsley, chopped
1/2 c  Green onions, chopped
4 c  Crumbled corn bread
2 c  Chicken stock
Salt and cayenne pepper
6    Whole squabs
Olive oil, for drizzling
12    Whole shallots
2 c  Demi-glace
1 tb Butter
1 lb Haricots verts, (blanched)
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large saute pan over medium
heat, render the bacon until crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in
the onions, celery, and bell peppers. Season with salt and pepper.
Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the eggplant and continue to saute
for 3 minutes. Season with salt and cayenne. Stir in 2 tablespoons
garlic, thyme, parsley and green onions. Remove from the heat and
turn into a mixing bowl. Stir in the corn bread and stock. Mix
thoroughly. Season the dressing with salt and cayenne. Season each
squab with olive oil, salt and cayenne. Stuff each cavity of the
squab with about 3/4 cup of the dressing. Toss the shallots with
olive oil, salt and pepper. Place the stuffed squab and shallots on a
parchment-lined roasting pan. Place the squab in the oven and roast
for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the squab is golden brown and the
juices run clear. Remove the pan from the oven and separate the
sections of the shallots. Place the shallots in a saucepan and cover
with the veal reduction. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a
simmer. Simmer for 2 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper.
In a large saute pan, melt the butter. Add the haricots verts and the
remaining garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 2 to 3
minutes. Serve the squabs with the haricots verts and a ladle of
shallot reduction.
