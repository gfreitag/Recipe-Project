Categories: Mario
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Castelluccio lentils
6 tb Virgin olive oil
1/2 md Red onion, chopped into
1/8    Thinch dice
3    Cloves garlic, thinly sliced
Plus 2 whole cloves
2    Sage leaves
2 c  Chicken broth
1/4 lb Tuscan or Umbrian country

6 oz Best quality extra virgin
Olive oil
Wash and drain lentils and pick through for pebbles.

In a 3quart sauce pan, heat oil until smoking.  Add onions, sliced
garlic and sage.  Cook until softened but not brown, about 6 to 8
minutes. Add lentils and chicken stock.  Add water to 1 inch over
lentils and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer for 25 to 30
minutes, keeping the level of the liquid just over the lentils by
periodically adding water. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Ladle into bowls and lay slices of salami in center.  Grill bread and
rub each slice with a garlic clove.  Place the garlic bread over
salami. Drizzle with olive oil and serve.
