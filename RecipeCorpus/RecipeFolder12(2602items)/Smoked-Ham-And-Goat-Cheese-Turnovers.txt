Title: Smoked Ham And Goat Cheese Turnovers
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Store-bought puff pastry
1/4 lb Smoked, cooked ham, chopped
4 oz Grated Spanish manchego
Cheese or sharp jack chees
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
2    Garlic cloves
1/4 c  Parsley leaves
1    Egg
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Lime juice
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Salt
Egg wash: 1 egg yolk beaten
With 2 tablespoonss cold
Water
Using a round pastry cutter, cut the pastry into 2-inch rounds. Roll
the remaining scrap into a ball and roll out with a rolling pin into
a 1/4-inch thick sheet and continue to cut rounds of puff pastry
until you've used up all of the pastry. As you cut the pastry, place
it on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper and refrigerate it until
the filling has been made.

For the filling, put the remaining ingredients, except the egg wash,
into a food processor and pulse for 1 to 2 minutes to combine well.
Scrape the sides of the bowl carefull with a rubber spatula and pulse
again briefly.

Heat a deep fat fryer to 365 degrees.

Lightly brush a round of pastry with some of the egg wash. Place 1
teaspoon of the ham filling in the center of the round and fold the
dough in half to create a dumpling. Continue to fill the pastry in
this way until all of the filling and pastry has been used up. Place
the finished turnovers on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet, brush
the tops with the remaining egg wash, and deep fry in batches for
several minutes until rich golden brown. Drain on paper towels and
serve immediately.

Yield: 24 to 36 turnovers
