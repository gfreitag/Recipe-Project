Title: Blueberry Beignets
Categories: Breads, Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Warm water (110 degrees)
1 pk Active dry yeast (1/4-ounce
= 2 1/2 teaspoons)
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Vegetable shortening
1/2 ts Salt
1 pt Fresh blueberries, rinsed
And stemmed
1/2 c  Boiling water
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1    Egg, beaten
4    To 4 1/2 cups flour
Oil for frying
Powdered sugar
Preheat the fryer.  In a mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the
water, for about 2 to 3 minutes.  Set the yeast aside in a warm,
draft-free place for about 10 minutes, or until the yeast bubbles up
and the mixture almost doubles in bulk.  In a mixing bowl, combine
the sugar, shortening, salt, and blueberries.  Stir in the boiling
water. Using a fork, lightly mash the blueberries against the side of
the bowl. Cool the mixture to 110 degrees F. Stir in the cream, yeast
mixture and egg. Add 2 cups of flour and blend well.

Stir in the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time until the dough is
smooth and not sticky.  If the dough becomes to stiff to stir easily
with a spoon, work in the flour with your fingers.  Turn the dough
out onto a floured surface and pat the dough into a rectangle about
1-inch thick. Lightly dust the surface of the dough with flour. Roll
out the rectangle to at least 25 inches long by 10 inches wide and
about 1/4-inch thick. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 10
five-inch square beignets and deep-fry them immediately.  Fry the
beignets, a couple at a time until golden brown and crispy on all
sides, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the beignets from the oil and
drain on a paper-lined plate. Sprinkle the beignets with powdered
sugar and serve.
