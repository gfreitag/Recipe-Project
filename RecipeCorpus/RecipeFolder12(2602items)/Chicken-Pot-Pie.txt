Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 9 by 9 by 2-inch square
baking pan. In a large saute pan, melt the butter. Add the onions and
celery and saute for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in
the flour and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes for a blond roux. Stir in
the chicken stock and bring the liquid up to a boil. Reduce to a
simmer and continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the sauce
starts to thicken. Stir in the half and half and continue to cook for
4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the potatoes,
carrots, peas and chicken. Mix the filling thoroughly. Line the
baking pan with one of the crusts. Pour the filling into the prepared
pan. Place the top crust on top of the filling. Carefully tuck the
overlapping crust into the pan, forming a thick edge. Crimp the edges
of the pan and place on a baking sheet. Place the sheet in the oven
and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes or until the crust is golden
brown and crispy. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before
serving.
