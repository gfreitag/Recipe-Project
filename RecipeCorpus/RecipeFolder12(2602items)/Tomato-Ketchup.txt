Categories: Rosengarten
Yield: 2 Quarts
2 lg Onions sliced 2/3 inch thick
1 ts Coriander seeds
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 ts Mustard seeds
1 c  Red wine vinegar
1/3    Cup, plus 1 tablespoon (1/4
Pound) packed brown sugar
1    Head garlic, cloves peeled
1/4 c  Capers with their brine
1/4 c  Hot sauce
3/4 ts Paprika
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
3/4 ts Ground allspice
3/4 ts Ground ginger
3/4 ts Ground oregano
3/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
4 ts Ground cardamom
Salt to taste
Three 28-ounce cans whole
Tomatoes
Two 12-ounce cans tomato
Paste
Place onion slices on grill.  Grill until the slices are blackened on
both sides about 15 minutes per side.

In small black skillet toast the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and
mustard seeds.

Toast these spices about 5 minutes, and then grind them in a mortar
and pestle or a spice grinder.

In saucepan combine the blackened onions, the toasted spices, red wine
vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, capers, and hot sauce.

Add the paprika, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, oregano, black pepper,
cardamom, and salt to taste.  Then add the whole tomatoes and tomato
paste.

Simmer this mixture for 3 hours, stirring every 15 minutes to break
up the tomatoes and to prevent sticking.  Puree some of the mixture
in blender.

If the pureed ketchup seems too thin, continue cooking it until it's
reduced to a consistency you like.
