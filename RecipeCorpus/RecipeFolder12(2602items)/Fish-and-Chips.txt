Title: Fish and Chips
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
8 c  Vegetable oil
6 c  Thinly sliced unpeeled red
Potatoes
1    (12-ounce) bottle of beer
2 lg Eggs
3 c  Flour, in all
1 ts Baking powder
Salt and pepper
Essence
4    (6-ounce) white fish fillets
Such as scrod, haddock, or
Cod, cut in half
2 tb White vinegar
3    Whole grilled green onions
1 tb Brunoise red peppers
1 tb Brunoise yellow peppers
In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add
the potatoes, separating the slices with a spoon and fry for 2
minutes. Reduce the heat and fry for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
Remove the chips and drain on a paper-lined baking sheet pan. Allow
the potatoes to cool completely, about 10 minutes, set aside. In a
mixing bowl, combine the beer, eggs, 2 1/2 cups of the flour, and
baking powder. Whisk the mixture until the batter is smooth. Season
with salt and pepper. Season the fillets and remaining flour with
Essence. Dredge the fillets in the flour. Turn up the heat to the
oil. Dip each piece of fish into the beer batter, covering the fish
completely. Shake off any excess batter and place the fish in the hot
oil. Fry the fish in two batches, for about 4-5 minutes on each side,
or until the fish is crispy. Remove the fish from the oil and drain
on a paper-lined plate. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Set the
fish aside in warm oven. Add the cooled potatoes to the hot oil and
fry until the chips are crisp and golden, about 4 minutes. Remove the
potatoes from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Place the
potatoes in a mixing bowl and toss with the vinegar, salt and pepper.
