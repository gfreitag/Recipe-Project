Title: Pears With Port And Blue Cheese
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Water
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Good port wine
2 tb Granulated sugar
1    Cinnamon stick
2    Or 3 whole cloves
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
4    Firm Bartlett pears
For the garnish:
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
1/4 lb Gorgonzola cheese or other
Blue cheese
1/2 lb Mesclun or your choice of
Fresh young salad greens
1/2 lb Thinly sliced prosciutto,
Westphalian, or real
Virginia ham,
Properly cooked and cooled
Bring the water, wine, sugar, and spices to a boil in a pot just large
enough to hold the pears. Lower the heat and simmer 5 minutes.

While the poaching liquid is cooking, peel, but do not core, the
pears. (Use a vegetable peeler for the neatest job with the least
waste.)

Poach the pears, uncovered, 20 minutes, or until they are just tender
to the tip of a knife. Remove from the heat, and cool the pears in
the liquid another 20 minutes. You can refrigerate them (still in the
liquid) for later use. When ready to serve, remove the pears from the
liquid, cut in half lengthwise, and remove the core with a teaspoon.
With a sharp knife, slice each pear half into 1/4-inch thick
lengthwise slices, leaving the neck of the pear unsliced so that you
can "fan" the pear half on its serving plate.

Make the garnish by combining the oil and vinegar in a bowl with the
crumbled

Gorgonzola. Add the mesclun and toss.

On each serving plate, place a pear half at the 6 o'clock position,
"fanning" it across the plate. Divide the prosciutto into 8 portions
and drape one portion across the middle of each serving plate,
covering the top half of the pear fan. Garnish each plate with 1/4
cup dressed greens, placed in the 12 o'clock position, above the
prosciutto.
