Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Ball of basic pizza dough
(enough dough for 1 pizza)
1 tb Olive oil
Salt and white pepper
1/2 c  Thick pesto
1/2 c  Roasted garlic
1 c  Diced Italian sausage,
Cooked
1    Red pepper, roasted, peeled,
Seeded and julienned
2 tb Chiffonade of basil
4    (1/2-inch) slices of fresh
Mozzarella cheese
1    Egg, beaten
1 c  Spicy tomato sauce, hot
2 tb Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
1 tb Chopped chives
1 tb Brunoise red peppers
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Place the dough out onto a floured
surface.  Roll the dough out to form a 12-inch circle.  Spread the
pesto over one half of the dough.  Layer the garlic, sausage,
peppers, and basil, alternately over the pesto.  Lay the Mozzarella
cheese over the basil. Fold the other side of the dough over the
filling and pinch the edges to seal the calzone.  Make three slashes
across the top of the calzone. Place the calzone on a parchment-lined
baking sheet. Brush the calzone with the egg wash. Bake for 20 to 25
minutes or until golden. Spoon the sauce in the center of the plate.
Slice the calzone in half and place in the center of the sauce.
Garnish with the grated cheese, chives and brunoise peppers.
