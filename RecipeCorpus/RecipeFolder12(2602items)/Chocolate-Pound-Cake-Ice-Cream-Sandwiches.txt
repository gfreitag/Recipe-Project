the chocolate. Whisk some of the hot milk mixture into the beaten
eggs. Add the egg mixture to the remaining milk and continue to cook
until the mixture comes back to a boil. This mixture will be thick
and will coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and strain
into a glass bowl. Cover the top of the mixture with plastic wrap and
cool completely. Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill
completely. Pour the filling into an ice cream

machine and follow the instructions for the churning time. Fold in the
pralines and freeze in 1 pound loaf pans. Yield: about 1/2 gallon .
After the ice cream is firm, remove from the pan. Slice the ice cream
into 1/2-inch slices. Place one slice of ice cream between two slices
of pound cake, forming a sandwich. Repeat process until all of the
cake is used. Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap and freeze until
ready to use. When ready, unwrap and serve.
