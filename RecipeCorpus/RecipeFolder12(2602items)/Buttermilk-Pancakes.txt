Title: Buttermilk Pancakes
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg, beaten lightly
1 c  Buttermilk plus additional
If necessary
Vegetable oil for brushing
The griddle
In a bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, egg, and 1 cup of
buttermilk, whisking the batter until it is smooth. The batter may be
made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. It will thicken
as it stands. Thin the batter to the desired consistency with the
additional buttermilk or some water, 1 tablespoon at a time.

Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot enough to make
drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with some of the
oil. Working in batches and using a 1/4 cup measure filled halfway,
pour the batter onto the griddle, cook the pancakes for 1 minute on
each side, or until they are golden, and keep them warm. Use the
pancakes for caviar pancakes or serve them plain with syrup.

Yield: Six 2-inch pancakes
