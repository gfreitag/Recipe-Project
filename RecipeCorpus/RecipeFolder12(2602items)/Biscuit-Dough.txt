Title: Biscuit Dough
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1    Stick cold butter, cut into
1/2    -inch dice
3/4 c  Cold milk
In a food processor, pulse the flour, baking powder and salt until
mixed. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse
meal with particles the size of peas and lentils, about 40 times.
Drizzle the milk evenly over the dry ingredients and pulse a few
times, just until incorporated and the dough forms small clumps. Turn
out the dough onto a work surface and knead once or twice to gather
it into a mass; do not overwork the dough. Gently pat the dough into
a disk or rectangle, as needed. The dough can be made up to 2 hours
ahead; wrap tightly and refrigerate.
