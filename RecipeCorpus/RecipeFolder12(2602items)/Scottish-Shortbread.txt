Title: Scottish Shortbread
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Best unsalted butter
1/2 c  Superfine sugar
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Place butter in mixer and beat with
paddle until soft and light.  Beat in sugar in a stream and continue
beating 5 to 10 minutes until the mixture is very light and whitened.
Stir in the flour by hand until it absorbed, no more or the dough
will toughen.

Scrape the dough onto a floured surface and flour the dough with
pinches of flour.  Press the dough out with your hands, then roll
over once or twice very gently with a rolling pin until the dough is
about 1/2-inch thick. Cut the dough with floured cutters and transfer
the cut pieces to a paper lined pan.

Bake the shortbread for about 15 minutes until it is very lightly
colored. Cool the shortbread on a rack.

To use a shortbread mold to shape, press the mold into the floured
dough and cut around it.  Transfer the cut and molded dough to a
paper lined pan and chill about 1 hour until firm.  Bake as above.
