Title: Annie's Bread And Butter Pickles
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
6 lb (12 medium) cucumbers, cut
Into 1/2-inch slices
1 c  Thinly sliced onions
1 c  Kosher salt for soaking
Brine:
3 c  White vinegar
1 c  Water
2 c  Sugar
20    Cloves garlic
1 tb Black peppercorns
10    Whole allspice
2 ts Whole mustard seed
Slice and soak the cucumbers and onions for 1 hour in 1 cup salt and
enough cold water to cover.

Make brine: Combine vinegar, water, sugar, garlic, peppercorns,
allspice and mustard seeds. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes.
Drain the cucumbers and onions but don't rinse. Pour the hot brine
over the cukes and onions and allow to sit in a nonreactive container
until cool, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, wash and sterilize 4 1-quart jars and lids to be used in
the canning by placing them briefly in a pot of hot water. When the
pickled mixture has cooled, fill the jars to the top with the
cucumbers and onions only, not the brine. Once you have filled all
the jars, divide the brine between the jars, filling them to the top.
With a hot clean towel, wipe the edges of the jars, secure the lids
and screw on the rings. You will now need to process them for 8-10
minutes in a simmering water bath. It is important for the jars to be
on a rack so they do not touch each other or the bottom of the pot.
The jars must be completely covered by the water therefore use a huge
pot. (Contact your local Ball Jar distributor for information on
equipment: racks, tongs, even pots). Allow the water in processing
bath to come to a boil, turn it down to a simmer and carefully place
the jars on a rack inside of the pot. Simmer for 8-10 minutes.
Carefully remove from the water, allow to cool, don't let the jars
touch. When they are cool, they should have a tight seal, no sound
should be heard when you push on the lid. Store for months on your
shelf.
