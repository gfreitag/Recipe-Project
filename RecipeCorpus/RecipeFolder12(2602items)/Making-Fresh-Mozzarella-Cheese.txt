Title: Making Fresh Mozzarella Cheese
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 ga Water
Salt
1 lb Fresh Mozzarella Curd
1 c  Finely chopped basil
1 c  Roasted garlic
In a large stock pot, add the water.  Add enough salt to the water
until it tastes like saltwater.  Bring the temperature of the water
up to about 120 to 130 degrees, until the touch of the water is like
hot bath water. Place a colander in the water.  Crumble the cheese
curd into the water. Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until the
curd starts to pull.

Using your hands or a spoon, pull the cheese until it begins to hold
shape. It's like pulling taffy.  Do not over pull the cheese because
the end product will be rubbery.  If the cheese hardens to soon, dip
it back in the water and repeat the pulling process. After the
desired weight is achieved, dip the cheese in an ice bath. The cheese
can either be stored in salted water or rolled in plastic wrap. If
you want to flavor the cheese, add the flavorings during the pulling
process. Rub your hands with the herbs and garlic and work them into
the cheese.

Yield: about 1 pound of cheese
