2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
12 tb Cold butter
1 c  Mashed roasted sweet

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a 1/2 sheet pan. In a mixing
bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar
together. Add the butter, and with your hands, work the butter into
the flour mixture until the mixture resembles a coarse cornmeal. Stir
in the sweet potatoes and pecans. Add the cream, a little at a time
until a soft dough is formed. Lightly flour a surface. Place the
dough onto the surface and dust the top with flour. Lightly press the
dough out to 1/2-inch thickness. Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter, cut
the biscuits into rounds. Place the biscuits on a greased baking
sheet and bake for about 15 minutes or until the biscuits are golden
brown.
