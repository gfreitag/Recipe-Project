bread crumbs, coating each side completely.  Carefully place in the
hot oil. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes or until the custard is golden brown.
Place the fryer basket directly over the custards to submerge them in
the oil and overall browning.  Remove from the fryer and sprinkle
with cinnamon and sugar mixture.  Drain on a paper-lined plate, Slice
the custard in half. Lay the slices against each other. Drizzle with
the caramel sauce. Garnish with whipped cream, mint, and powdered
