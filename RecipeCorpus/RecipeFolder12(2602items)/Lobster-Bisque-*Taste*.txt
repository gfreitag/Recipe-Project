Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add the carrots, celery and onions
and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add sections from lobsters to
pan and saute until shells turn red. Remove pieces from pan when cool
enough and remove meat from tails and claws and reserve it.

Chop shells into smaller pieces and add to pan. Add cognac and
ignite. Then add the white wine, water, garlic, tarragon and bay
leaf. Crush the drained tomatoes with hands and add to pot. Season
with salt and pepper.

Simmer over low heat for 45 minutes, but do not allow liquid to boil.
Remove as many pieces of shell as possible. Put soup through food
mill and return milled broth to pan. Add the reserved lobster meat
and rice. Simmer over low heat another 45 minutes, or until reduced
to 2 cups.

Pulse shells in a food processor until finely chopped. Melt butter in
a saute pan, add chopped shells and saute 5 minutes. Strain,
reserving butter and discarding shells.

Transfer reduced lobster-rice mixture to blender and puree. Strain the
puree through a sieve over a mixing bowl and return broth to pot. Add
the lobster butter and stir well.

Add cognac and heat for 5-7 minutes. Add the light cream and milk.
Heat through, but do not boil.
