1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 tb Olive oil
1    Yellow onion, diced
1    Anaheim chile, seeded and

4    Garlic cloves

1 ts Freshly ground pepper

To make annatto oil: Place the annatto seeds in a dry pan and toast
over medium heat. Keep shaking the pan and tossing the seeds until
their aroma is released, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the vegetable oil
and set aside. When cool, strain to remove seeds. Heat the annatto
and olive oils in a large skillet. Add the onion, chile, garlic, red
peppers, recao and cilantro. SautJ over medium heat until vegetables
soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and continue
cooking for 2 more minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook two more
minutes. Allow to cool, then transfer mixture to a food processor or
blender and puree. Pour marinade into a large bowl and stir in
vinegar. Add remaining marinade ingredients. Place the ribs in the
marinade and allow to sit for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Preheat
oven to 350 degrees. Remove the ribs from the marinade and place them
in a baking pan single layer (save marinade for basting). Add 1/4inch
water to the pan, cover and bake for one hour. Uncover and bake for
another hour, basting with the reserved marinade every 15 minutes.
