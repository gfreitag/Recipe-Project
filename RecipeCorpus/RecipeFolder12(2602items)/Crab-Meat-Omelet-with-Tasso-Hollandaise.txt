Categories: Emeril, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Crab meat, picked over for
Cartilage
1/4 c  Minced shallots
2 tb Chopped green onions
8    Eggs
1/4 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper
1    Stick butter
1 c  Grated Smoked Gouda cheese
2    Egg yolks
1 ts Fresh lemon juice
ds Tabasco
2 ts Water
1    Stick melted butter
2 oz Tasso, finely chopped
In a mixing bowl, combine the crab meat, shallots, and green onions
together.  Season with salt and pepper.  In a mixing bowl, whisk the
whole eggs and cream together.  Season the eggs with salt and pepper.
Heat the 2 tablespoons of butter in a 6-inch non-stick sautÂ‚ pan
until it foams.

Pour in a quarter of the beaten eggs.  Using a rubber spatula, pull
the cooked egg away from the pan and allow the raw egg to run onto
the hot part of the pan.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the crab mixture and
1/4 cup of the grated cheese over the eggs.  When almost set, tap the
edge of the pan opposite of the handle, on the edge of the burner,
moving the egg down to the edge of the pan.  Tap to fold the egg over
by one-third, then fold onto a small service plate.  Repeat the
process until all the eggs are used.

In a stainless steel bowl set over a pot of simmering water, whisk
the egg yolks with the lemon juice, Tabasco, and water, until pale
yellow in color. Season with salt and pepper.  Be careful not to let
the bowl touch the water.  Remove the bowl from the pot and whisking
vigorously, add the butter, 1 teaspoon at a time, until all is
incorporated. Add the tasso and continue whisking for 30 seconds. To
assemble, spoon the sauce over each omelet and garnish with green
onions.
