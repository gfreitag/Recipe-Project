Title: Mansion On Turtle Creek Chocolate Truffles
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
8 oz Semisweet or bittersweet
Chocolate, chopped fine
1/3 c  Dutch process cocoa powder
3 oz Unsalted (sweet) butter cut
Into small pieces
1    Egg yolk
Place chocolate and butter in a 4 to 6 cup heat-proof bowl. Place
bowl in a wide skillet of barely

simmering water, over low heat. Stir frequently until chocolate and
butter are completely melted and smooth. Remove bowl and set aside.
Leave skillet on low heat.

Place egg yolk in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup boiling
water. Place bowl in a skillet and stir constantly with a spoon until
yolk mixture thickens slightly, to the consistency of half-and-half
(it will be between 160 to 165 degrees and safe from salmonella).
Remove yolk mixture from hot water and scrape immediately into melted
chocolate. Stir gently with a rubber

spatula (do not whisk or beat), just until chocolate and butter are
completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Pour through a fine
strainer into a clean bowl. Cover and chill until firm, 2 hours or
more.

To form truffles, remove truffle mixture from the refrigerator and
allow to soften about 30 minutes (if mixture is very hard). Pour
cocoa into a pie plate. Dip a melon baller or small spoon into a
glass of hot water; wipe off excess water and scrape across surface
of chilled truffle mixture to form an irregular ball 3/4 inch to 1
inch in diameter. Pinch the truffle into shape with your fingers, if
necessary; it should not be perfectly round. Deposit truffle into
cocoa. Repeat with remaining truffle mixture.

Gently shake pie plate to coat truffles with cocoa. Store truffles
tightly covered, and refrigerated up to 2 weeks, or freeze up to 3
months.

Yield: about 30 bite-size truffles
