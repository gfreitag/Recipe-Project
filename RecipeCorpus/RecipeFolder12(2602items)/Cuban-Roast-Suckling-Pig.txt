Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1    10- to 12-pound whole
Suckling pig
3 c  Freshly-squeezed orange
Juice
1 c  Freshly-squeezed lime juice
(from about 8 medium limes)
12    Garlic cloves
1    Onion
1 tb Salt
1 tb Oregano
2 tb Olive oil
4    Bay leaves
Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Wearing rubber gloves to
protect your hands, hold pig by head and submerge as much of body as
possible in water for 1 minute. Remove, reverse pig and, holding tail
end, submerge head and as much of body as possible, 1 minute. Place
in a snug-fitting, non-reactive pan and pour orange and lime juice
over and inside pig.

In a food processor combine garlic, onion and salt. Add oregano and
olive oil and process to a paste. Smear inside and out of pig with
garlic paste and scatter with bay leaves. Tightly cover pig with
plastic wrap and marinate, refrigerated, 48 hours, turning
occasionally.

Preheat oven to 200 degree. Transfer pig to a large roasting pan.
Pull hind legs forward toward head and prop it up so its back is up
and it is sitting on its hind legs. Open mouth a stuff with crumpled
aluminum foil. Roast pig 12 to 13 hours, basting with marinade every
hour. A meat thermometer inserted in thickest part will register 190
degrees. To brown and crisp skin, turn heat up to 350 degrees for
last 1/2 hour of cooking. Let sit, loosely covered with foil, 1/2
hour before carving.
