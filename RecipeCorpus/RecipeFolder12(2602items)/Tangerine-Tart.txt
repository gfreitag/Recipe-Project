Melted
5 c  Sliced tangerines, rind
Removed
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla

For the crust: In the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan, mix the crumbs and
butter together. Press the mixture into the pie pan to form a crust.
Bake for 7 to 8 minutes or until golden. Remove from the oven and
cool. For the filling: In a sauce pan, combine the tangerines, sugar
and the vanilla. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Dissolve the
cornstarch and brandy together forming a slurry. Add the slurry to
the tangerine mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture
thickens, about 10 minutes. Pour into the prepared pie crust and
refrigerate for 6 hours, or until the filling sets. Place a piece of
the pie on a plate. Garnish with spiced whipped cream, fresh mint
sprigs, and powdered sugar.
