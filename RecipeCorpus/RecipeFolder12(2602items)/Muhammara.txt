Preheat the grill. Roast the peppers and chiles over the grill or open
flame until they are blistered , about 8 minutes. Place in a bowl,
cover with plastic wrap and let steam for 10 minutes to loosen the
skin. Peel off the skin and remove the seeds. Pat the peppers dry
with a paper towel. In the work bowl of your food processor, combine
and process the crackers, walnuts, lemon juice, pomegranate molasses,
cumin, and sugar , until smooth. Add the red peppers and process
until creamy. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a thin
stream. Add the chile pepper and salt to taste. If it is too thick,
thin with a few tablespoons of water. Refrigerate overnight to allow
the flavors to mellow. Serve with the toasted pita wedges.
