Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
1    Sweet dried red romesco
Pepper, (or substitute a
Roasted red bell
Pepper)
1 sl Bread, toasted
10    Blanched almonds, toasted
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
4    Cloves garlic, peeled
1    Tomato, peeled, seeded and
Chopped
1/3 c  Olive oil
1    To 2 tablespoons warm water
12    To 16 knob onions, or
Calcots
Prepare the romesco sauce: If using a dried pepper, remove the stem
and seeds from the pepper and soak in warm water for 1 hour, or until
softened. Scrape off the flesh and discard skin. If using a roasted
pepper, remove the charred skin, stem, and seeds, and chop. Set aside.

In a food processor, finely chop the bread and almonds. Add the salt,
pepper, garlic, tomato and reserved flesh of the pepper. Process to a
smooth paste. With the motor running, add the olive oil in a thin
stream, until mixture is the consistency of a thick, creamy sauce.
Add the warm water as needed to help thin the sauce if necessary.
Adjust the seasonings, transfer to a bowl and set aside at room
temperature or chill until ready to serve.

Preheat a grill or broiler, and preheat an oven to 400 degrees F.
Trim the roots off the onions and spread them over the grill. Grill
the onions until charred all over but not dried out, turning
frequently. Transfer the onions to a large roasting pan, cover
tightly and roast in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Serve the onions
steaming hot, strip back the charred outer skin, dip the onions in
the romesco sauce, eat the white bottoms and discard the top.
