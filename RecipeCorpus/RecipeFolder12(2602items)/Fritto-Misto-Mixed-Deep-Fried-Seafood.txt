Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Olive oil
Water to moisten
Salt and pepper
3    Egg whites, lightly beaten
1 lb Calamari, sliced into
1/2    -inch rings
2    Dozen shucked mussels
2    Dozen shucked oysters
1 lb Large shrimp, tail on and
Deveined
1    Dozen red mullets
1    Seabass fillet, (about 8 to
10    Ounces) cut into 2-ounce
Portions
1    Onion, cut into 1/2-inch
Rings
1    Zucchini, cut into
Individual strips about
1    Inch by 4-inch
Oil for frying
2 c  Mariana sauce, hot
1/2 c  Garlic aioli
1/2 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
2 tb Chopped parsley
In a mixing bowl, whisk the flour and olive oil together. Add enough
water to thin out the batter but not too thin. Season with salt and
pepper. Leave the batter for 30 minutes, then fold in the egg whites.
Season all the seafood and vegetables with salt and pepper. Dip each
piece of seafood in the batter, letting the excess drip off. This
will be very messy so have plenty of towels on hand. Preheat the oil.
Fry the fish in batches, starting with the calamari and ending with
the seabass. You might want to have two stockpots or large skillets
of oil on to speed up the frying process. After each batch of frying,
make sure that the oil comes back up to temperature. Dip the
vegetables in the batter, letting the excess drip off and fry until
golden brown about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove all fried items from the
oil and drain on paper-lined plates. Season every item with salt and
pepper. Spoon the Mariana sauce over the bottom of a large platter.
Pile the fried seafood and vegetables on top of the sauce. Garnish
with drizzles of aioli, cheese and parsley.
