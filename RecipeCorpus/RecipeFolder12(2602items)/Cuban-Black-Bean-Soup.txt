Title: Cuban Black Bean Soup
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Dried black (turtle) beans
3 tb Olive oil
3 md White onions, chopped (about
5 1/2    Cups)
2 lg Red sweet peppers, chopped
3    Stalks celery, chopped
3 tb Chili powder
3 tb Ground cumin
2 tb Finely chopped garlic
1/4 c  Tomato paste
4 qt Cold water
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper to taste
1/4 c  Dry (not cooking) sherry
Garnish:
Sour cream
Chopped scallions or chives
Sort the beans carefully to remove any dirt and debris.  Rinse the
beans in cold water and then soak them overnight covered with more,
clean, fresh cold water and place in the refrigerator.  Drain any
excess water before adding the beans to the soup pot.

In a large soup pot with a heavy bottom, heat the olive oil.  Add the
onions, peppers, celery, chili powder, and cumin, and saute over
medium heat until the vegetables wilt.  Add the garlic and tomato
paste and cook an additional 3 minutes, stirring to make sure you
don't burn the tomato or garlic.  Add the water and bring to a boil.

Add the black beans, return to a boil, then lower to a simmer and
cook for 2 to 21/2 hours, or until the beans are tender.  Remove from
the heat, season with salt and pepper to taste, and allow to cool for
half an hour before pureeing in small batches in a blender or food
processor.

If you are serving immediately, return the soup to a boil and add 1/4
cup dry sherry.  Cook 2 minutes more.  Ladle into bowls and garnish
each with a tablespoon of sour cream and a sprinkling of scallions or
chives. If you are preparing the soup ahead of time, cool thoroughly
after blending, transfer to a container with a tightly fitting lid,
and store in the refrigerator for up to a week. Add the sherry after
reheating the soup to serve.

Yield: 6 to 8/ 8 ounce portions
