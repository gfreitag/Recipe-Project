These two different pastry doughs have very different textures.  The
first is flaky due to the incorporation of butter in small pieces: as
the dough cooks, the butter melts and the water in it turns to steam
and puffs up the dough.  The second dough is tender and crumbly: the
butter is well creamed as for a cookie; the confectioner's sugar adds
tenderness due to the cornstarch it contains; the ground almonds,
which can be substituted for some of the flour in any pastry dough
recipe, add an interesting graininess.
