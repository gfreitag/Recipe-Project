Title: Red Snapper With Tomato-Onion Compote
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
3 c  Sliced onions
8 md Tomatoes
1 ts Sherry vinegar
1 tb Minced tarragon
3/4 ts Kosher salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
6    6-ounce red snapper fillets,
Skin on
Flour for dredging
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a skillet heat 2 tablespoons of
the olive oil over moderate heat.  Add the sliced onions and cook,
stirring occasionally until completely tender and sweet, about 30
minutes. If any of the onions stick to the bottom of the pan, stir in
a few tablespoons of water.  This will release the onions and coat
them with a sweet caramelized flavor.  Set the pan aside. Core the
tomatoes and cut them in half widthwise.  Place them cut side down on
a lightly oiled baking sheet. Place the baking sheet on the oven's
upper rack and roast until the skin blisters and begins to curl away
from the tomatoes, about 30-40 minutes. When the tomatoes are cool
enough to handle yet still warm, gently lift the skin from the tomato
and squeeze out the seeds. Combine the tomatoes with the cooked
onions.  Add the sherry vinegar and simmer over moderate heat,
stirring occasionally until slightly thick. Stir in the minced
tarragon, 1/4 teaspoon salt and half the pepper, and remove from the
heat. The compote can be prepared up to one day ahead to this point,
and stored, covered and refrigerated. Dredge the skin-side of the
snapper in the flour and season both sides with the remaining salt
and pepper. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over
medium heat. Saute the snapper skin-side down for 4-5 minutes.  Turn
the fish over with a spatula and cook an additional 1-2 minutes.
While the fish is cooking return the compote to a simmer.  When the
fish is done, transfer the compote to a serving platter and arrange
the snapper fillets on top.
