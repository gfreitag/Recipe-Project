2 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/2 c  Chopped bell peppers
4    Bay leaves
4    Sprigs fresh thyme

In a large saucepan, heat the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the
onions, celery, and bell peppers to the saucepan.  Season the
vegetables with salt and cayenne.  Saut the vegetables for 5
minutes, or until the vegetables start to wilt.  Add the bay leaves,
thyme, ham hocks, and pork meat and saut for 5 to 6 minutes.  Add
the beans, garlic, and stock or water. Bring the liquid up to a boil
and reduce to a simmer. Cook for about 2 hours, uncovered. Add more
stock or water if the mixture becomes dry and thick. Use a wooden
spoon to mash 1/4 of the mixture. Continue to cook, stirring
occasionally, for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are tender
and creamy.  Add more liquid if it is too thick.  The mixture should
be soupy, but not watery.  Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. To
serve ladle into bowls with rice.  Garnish with green onions.
