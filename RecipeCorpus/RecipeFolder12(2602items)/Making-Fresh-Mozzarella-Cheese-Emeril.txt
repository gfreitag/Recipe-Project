Title: Making Fresh Mozzarella Cheese-Emeril
Categories: Eggs/cheese, Emeril
Yield: 1 Pound
Salt
2 gallons water
1    Pound Fresh Mozzarella Curd
1    Cup finely chopped basil
1    Cup roasted garlic
In a large stock pot, add the water. Add enough salt to the water
until it tastes like saltwater. Bring the temperature of the water up
to about 120 to 130, until the touch of the water is like hot bath
water. Place a colander in the water. Crumble the cheese curd into
the water. Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until the curd
starts to pull. Using your hands or a spoon, pull the cheese until it
begins to hold shape. It's like pulling taffy. Do not over pull the
cheese because the end product will be rubbery. It is like you are
pulling taffy. If the cheese hardens to soon, dip the cheese back in
the water and repeat the pulling process. After the desired weight is
achieved dip the cheese in an ice bath. The cheese can either be
stored in salted water or rolled in plastic wrap. If you want to
flavor the cheese, add the flavorings during the pulling process. Rub
your hands with the herbs and garlic and work them into the cheese.

Yields: about 1 pound of cheese
