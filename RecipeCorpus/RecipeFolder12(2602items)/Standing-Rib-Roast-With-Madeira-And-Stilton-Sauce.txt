Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1    (5 to 7 pound) beef rib
Roast
1/2 c  Vodka
3 tb Salt
1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
12    Bay leaves
Madeira and Stilton Sauce:
8    Shallots, finely minced
1 tb Butter
1 c  Madeira
2 c  Beef stock
7 tb Unsalted butter, cold
4 oz Stilton, crumbled
Fresh horseradish, for
Garnish
Fresh watercress, for
Garnish
Rub the roast all over with vodka. Rub in the salt and pepper. Cut
small pockets in the fat and insert the bay leaves. Let roast sit at
room temperature for 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Place the beef in a roasting pan and roast 30 minutes. Reduce the
heat to 325 degrees F and roast 12 to 15 more minutes per pound for
rare to medium rare. When beef is cooked, let it sit in a warm place
for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, caramelize shallots in 1 tablespoon of the butter and
deglaze with Madeira in a saucepan over high heat until wine is
reduced by half. Add stock and reduce again by half. Break butter
into small pieces and whisk into sauce until completely smooth.
Reduce heat to low, add Stilton and whisk until melted. Keep warm,
but be careful not to overheat as sauce will separate.

Carve the beef, serve the warm sauce with the beef, along with fresh
horseradish and watercress.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
