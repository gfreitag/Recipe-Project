Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 10-inch springform pan.

1/2 cup of crumbs and transfer remaining crumbs to a bowl; add graham
crackers and stir in melted butter. Press crumb mixture on bottom and
halfway up sides of springform pan. Bake 5 minutes; cool completely.

In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water and let soften. In a
large bowl combine hot espresso with sugar and gelatin mixture and
stir to dissolve. Let cool slightly. Add ricotta cheese and beat
until smooth. Stir in vanilla. In a chilled bowl whip 1/2 cup of the
cream to stiff peaks; fold into coffee mixture. Pour half of coffee
mixture into crust, top with reserved amaretti crumbs and cover with
remaining coffee mixture. Smooth top. Chill overnight.

To serve, run a knife around edge of pan to loosen and carefully
remove springform rim. Whip remaining 1/4 cup heavy cream flavored
with cinnamon to stiff peaks, transfer to a pastry tube and pipe
decorative rosettes on cake. Sprinkle with toasted almonds.
