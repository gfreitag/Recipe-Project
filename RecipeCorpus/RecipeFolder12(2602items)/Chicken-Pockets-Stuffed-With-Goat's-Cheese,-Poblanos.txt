green onions, shallots, garlic, cilantro, chili powder, cumin, salt

cups of stuffing.

Spread the chicken breast on a flat surface and sprinkle each, top
side only with essence. Place a heaping 1/3 cup of the stuffing on
half of each chicken breast and fold the other half over the stuffing
and pinch the edges together. Brush the tops with the oil and
sprinkle with the remaining essence.

Place the pockets on the baking sheet and bake until the chicken is
golden brown, for about 18 minutes. These great little treats can be
made a day ahead of time to allow enough time for pregame festivities.

For the Creole Mustard Aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, creole mustard
garlic and green onions together. Season with salt and pepper. Place
the aioli in a small bowl in the center of a platter and arrange the
pockets, which should be cut on the bias around the aioli.
