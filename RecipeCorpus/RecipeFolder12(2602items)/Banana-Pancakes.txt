Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
1 lg Egg
1 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Whole milk
1 tb Melted unsalted butter
About 3 tablespoons unsalted
Butter
3    Ripe bananas, cut into
1/3    -inch slices
Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and baking powder.
In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, buttermilk, milk and melted
butter. Add the dry ingredients.  Stir until the flour disappears,
being careful not to overbeat the batter.  Preheat the oven to 200
degrees F. Melt 1/2 tablespoon of the butter in a large cast-iron
skillet over medium heat. Ladle about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan
for each pancake. Immediately press 4 or 5 banana slices into each,
so the batter oozes slightly over the fruit.  Cook until bubbles
appear and then flip and cook on the other side, about 3 minutes
total. Transfer the pancakes to a platter and keep warm in the oven
while you cook the remaining batches, adding butter to the pan as
needed.  Serve hot with warm coconut syrup.

Yield: 4-6 servings

Favorite Sunday brunch item at Border Grill.  Better if batter sits
overnight.  Can also use strawberries or blueberries. or serve with
maple syrup.
