Title: Basic Bread Dough
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Warm water
3 ts Yeast (dry)
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
4 c  High gluten flour
4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Place warm water in a warm mixing bowl and add yeast. Stir to
dissolve and let stand 3 minutes. Add salt and sugar and stir
through. Add flour and olive oil and mix, using hands until you can
knead the dough without it sticking to your fingers.

Wash and dry hands and remove ball to cutting board. Knead the dough,
occasionally dusting with 1 teaspoon flour, until a firm, smooth
homogenous ball is formed, about 15 minutes. Place ball of dough in a
lightly oiled mixing bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow
to rise in a warm place until its size is doubled, about 2 hours.
Punch down and divide into 4 pieces. Dough is now ready for use.
