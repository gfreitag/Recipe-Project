1/2 c  Rice wine vinegar
1/2 c  Fresh tangerine juice
5    Fresh bay scallops
1 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper
1 c  Arugula, cleaned

For the gastrique: In a sauce pot, combine the sugar, rice wine
vinegar, and tangerine juice. Bring up to a boil and reduce to a
simmer. Reduce until the liquid is a syrup. About 15 to 20 minutes.
For the scallops: In a saute pan, heat the olive oil. Season each
side of the scallops with salt and pepper. When the pan is smoking
hot, add the scallops. Sear the scallop on one side until golden
brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the scallop over and sear the other
side until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. For the salad: In a mixing
bowl, toss the arugula and extra-virgin olive oil together. Season
with salt and pepper. To assemble, mound the arugula in the center of
the platter. Arrange the scallops around the arugula. Drizzle the
gastrique over the entire platter. Garnish with the tangerine slices,
shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and black pepper.
