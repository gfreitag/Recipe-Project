Courtbouillon means quickboiling in French; it doesn't need to cook
for long (compared to a stock). Can use this courtbouillon to poach
any fish as well as shrimp, squid, etc.

A courtbouillon should be fullflavored and wellseasoned, with a good
dose of acidity to firm up the protein in the fish. No need to season
fish fillets with salt and pepper as seasoning is already in the
liquid.
