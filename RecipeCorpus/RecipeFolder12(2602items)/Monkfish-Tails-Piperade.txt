Title: Monkfish Tails Piperade
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 lg Green bell peppers
2 lg Red bell peppers
1 lg Yellow onion
2 tb Or so olive oil
2    Or 3 cloves garlic, pureed
1 ts Mixed herbs
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper
3 1/2 lb Trimmed monkfish fillets
Flour
2 tb Olive oil
About 1 cup each dry white
Wine or French Vermouth, and
Fish or chicken
Broth
Fresh tomato fondue (see
Recipe)
Wash, halve, stem and seed the peppers, and cut into very fine long
thin slices. Peel the onion, halve through the root, and cut into thin
lengthwise slices. Film a large frying pan with the oil, add heat for
4 to 5 minutes while you add the garlic, herbs and seasonings.
Vegetables should be partially cooked; they will finish with the
fish. May be done in advance to this point; let cool uncovered, then
transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Cut the fish into serving
chunks. Just before you are to saute it, season all sides with a
sprinkling of salt and pepper, dredge lightly in flour, and shake off
excess. Into a second frying pan (or in the same one, if you have
done the vegetables ahead), pour in enough oil to film it and set
over moderately high heat. When very hot but not smoking, add the
fish in one layer. Saute for 2 minutes, then turn and saute for 2
minutes on the other side-not to brown, merely to stiffen slightly.
Spread the cooked vegetables over the fish. Pour in the wine and
broth-enough to come halfway up the fish. Cover and simmer about 10
minutes. Fish is done when it has turned from springy to gently
soft-it needs a little more cooking than other fish, but must not
overcook and fall apart. Arrange fish and vegetables on a hot platter
and cover. Rapidly boil down the juices in frying pan until almost
syrupy, then spoon them over the fish, and serve, surrounded by the
optional tomato fondue.
