Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
4    Boneless duck breasts
2    Shallots, halved and thinly
Sliced
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 ts Minced ginger
2    Firm pears, Bosc, peeled,
Cored and finely chopped
1/4 c  Pear eau-de-vie
1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
1/4 c  Chicken stock
1 ts Finely chopped thyme, plus
Additional sprigs for
Garnish
2 tb Chopped walnuts
Salt and pepper to taste
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Score the skin of the duck breasts and pat them dry. Season them with
salt and pepper. Over medium high heat, heat a large oven proof saute
pan until very hot. Sear the duck, skin side down until fat is
rendered and the skin is golden. Pour off most of the rendered fat,
reserving 3 tablespoons for later. Transfer the pan to the oven and
finish roasting until medium rare, about 5 minutes.

In a saute pan, heat the reserved duck fat. Add the shallots, garlic,
ginger, and pears. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes.
Add the eau-de-vie, balsamic vinegar and stock and cook over high
heat, about 3 minutes, until the mixture is slightly thick and the
pears are tender. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme, walnuts
and season with salt and pepper.

Thinly slice each duck breast and serve with sauce. Garnish with thyme
sprigs.
