Title: Frosting And Chocolate Glaze
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
10 oz Semisweet chocolate, finely
Chopped
1 c  Heavy cream
Frost the cake with the whipped cream. Place the cake on a wire rack,
then set it on a sheet pan that will fit the dimensions of your
freezer. Place in the freezer for 40 minutes only, (his is just
enough time to chill the whipped cream frosting so it's firm to the
touch, not soft.) While the cake is in the freezer, prepare the dark
chocolate glaze. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small
saucepan, heat the heavy cream just to the boil. Remove from heat.
Pour over chocolate and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is
smooth and shiny. Set aside to cool to body temperature.

Set the cake on its wire rack over a baking pan with sides (like a
jelly roll pan) on top of a turntable (or lazy susan.) Pour almost
all of the chocolate glaze over the center of the cake. Using a long,
flexible metal icing spatula, use just a few strokes to spread the
glaze over the top of the cake so the glaze runs down over the sides.
Rotate the turntable as you spread. Use the spatula to scoop up
excess glaze to touch it to any bare spots on the sides of the cake
to cover them. Place the cake on a serving plate. Refrigerate until
30 to 60 minutes before serving. Using a serrated knife, dipped into
hot water after each slice, cut dessert into wedges.
