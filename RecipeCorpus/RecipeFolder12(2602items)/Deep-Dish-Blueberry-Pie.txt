just holds together. Do not overmix. Remove dough to a floured board.

Combine all ingredients except the butter in a large bowl. Transfer
mixture to a 9 by 2 inch deep- dish pie pan. Dot with the butter.
Roll the dough out to 1-inch larger than the baking dish. Top berries
in casserole with the dough. Flute the edges of the dough and cut
several slits in the dough to allow steam to escape. Brush with the
eggwash.
