1 tb Unsalted butter
1 1/2 lb Tenderloin of beef, cut into

Salt and pepper to taste
1 sm Vidalia onion, cut into a
md Dice
2    Poblano peppers, washed,

2 oz Gold tequila
1/4 c  Lime juice
1 c  Rich veal stock

1/2 c  Heavy cream

1/2 ts Ground black pepper
Heat the olive oil and butter in a saute pan over medium heat, season
the beef medallions with salt and pepper, and add to the hot pan.
Turn the heat up to high and char both sides of the beef well. To
keep the beef rare to medium rare, cook quickly, turning once only
after the beef has browned on the first side.

Remove the beef from the pan, place on a warm platter, and set aside.

Add the diced onions and poblano peppers to the saute pan, evenly
spread out and cook till wilted. Add the cumin and combine well to
toast the spice again.

Working carefully away from the flame, add the tequila to the pan,
deglaze the pan by swirling the tequila and set back over low heat to
reduce.

Add the lime juice and reduce to almost dry before adding the veal
stock. Reduce the stock by half over high heat and add the orange
liquor and fresh orange zest. Cook for 2 minutes and then add the
heavy cream. Do not allow to boil but gently simmer for 2 minutes
before adding the salt and pepper.

Serve the beef on a bed of sauce with corn pudding on the side.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
