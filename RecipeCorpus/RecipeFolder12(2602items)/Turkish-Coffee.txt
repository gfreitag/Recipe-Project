Categories: 2hot

3/4 c  Cold water
1 1/2 ts Sugar (more or less
Depending on sweetness
Desired)
3 tb Freshly ground medium roast
Coffee
Combine all ingredients in the cezve and mix with a spoon. Put the
cezve over very low heat and do not stir. After about 3 minutes, a
thick foam rises to the surface. Just as the coffee is about to
bubble up and overflow, immediately remove the cezve from the heat.
Gently divide the foam between 2 demitasse cups, then place the cezve
back on the heat for a few seconds. Pour the coffee into the cups,
carefully pouring it down the sides of the cups in order not to
disturb the foam. The coffee grains will settle at the bottom of the
cup.
