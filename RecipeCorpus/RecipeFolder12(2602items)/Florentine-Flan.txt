1 ts Garlic

Melt the butter in a large saute pan, add the spinach and cook,
stirring until completely wilted, about 4 minutes. Add the oysters
and the garlic. Cook, stirring until the oysters plump, about 5
minutes. Using a wooden spoon, fold in the Mornay sauce, and season.
Cook until completely heated through and pour into the tart shell.
Sprinkle the top of the tart with cheese and blast under the broiler
until it melts, 3 minutes or so. Meanwhile, fry the spinach leaves in
hot oil for 2 minutes, season. When you remove the tart from the
oven, top with the fried spinach leaves.

MORNAY SAUCE: In a sauce pan, melt the butter. Stir in the flour.
Cook for 2 minutes over medium. Pour in the milk all at once. Bring
to a boil and cook until thick and bubbly, about 3 minutes. Remove
from the heat and add the cheese, stirring until it is melted and
season with pepper.
