Make the marinade: In a food processor or blender puree the scallion,
the 2 chilies, the soy sauce, the lime juice, the allspice, the
mustard, the bay leaves, the garlic, the salt, the sugar, the thyme
and the cinnamon.

Divide the chicken parts between 2 heavy-duty resealable plastic bags
and spoon the marinade over them, coating them well. Seal the bags,
pressing out the excess air, and let the chicken marinate, chilled,
turning the bags over several times, for at least 24 hours and up to
2 days.

On an oiled rack set 4 to 6 inches over glowing coals grill the
chicken, in batches if necessary and covered if possible, for 10 to
15 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked through. Transfer the
chicken as it is cooked with tongs to a heated platter, keep it warm,
covered loosely with foil, and garnish the platter with the
additional chilies.

Yield: 10 servings as part of a buffet
