Title: Duo Bbq Ribs
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2    Full racks of 3/down pork
Spare ribs
3/4 c  Essence, more if needed
3 tb Sugar
2    Slabs of baby back ribs
2 c  White vinegar
2 tb Tabasco sauce
3 tb Brown sugar
ds Worcestershire sauce
Salt and fresh black pepper
Prepare the charcoals according to the directions on the grill for
slow barbecuing.  In a mixing bowl, combine the Essence with the
sugar. Blend thoroughly.  Season the spare ribs entirely with the
Essence mix. It is best to season the ribs, cover and refrigerate
overnight or at least for 12 hours.  But this recipe is great just
seasoning and placing right on the grill.  Place the ribs on the
grill and cook for about 3 hours, turning occasionally.  Remove the
ribs from the grill and slice. Season the baby back ribs with salt
and pepper. In a mixing bowl, whisk the vinegar, Tabasco, and brown
sugar together. Season the sauce with Worcestershire sauce, salt and
pepper. Place the ribs in a large dish and pour the sauce over the
top. Cover the ribs and place in the refrigerator. Marinate for at
least 12 hours.  Place the ribs on the prepared grill and cook for 45
minutes on one side and flip over.  Continue to cook for 45 minutes.
Feed the fire every 30 minutes.  Baste the ribs every 15 minutes.
Remove the ribs from the grill and slice.

Yield: about 6 servings
