Title: Cranberry Apple Tarte Tatin
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
1    Recipe Pate Sucree
5 lg Apples (about 2 1/2 pounds)
Juice of one lemon
4 tb Butter
3/4 c  Plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1/3 c  Cranberries (optional)
Make the dough.  Form into a 5-inch disk, wrap in plastic and chill
one hour, or up to 3 days.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator
and on a lightly floured surface, roll it to a 12-inch circle. Brush
off any excess flour.  Place the round on a sheet tray lined with wax
or parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
ready to use. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Peel, core and slice each
apple in half. Slice each half in 3 sections and toss the apples in
lemon juice. Set aside. Melt the butter, sugar and 1/4 teaspoon lemon
juice together in an ovenproof skillet measuring 10 inches across the
top. (Bakelite handles are ovenproof.) Cook, stirring, until the
mixture turns a light caramel color.  Be careful not to overcook; it
will continue to darken from the residual heat in the pan. Remove
from heat.  Arrange the apple slices, rounded side down, in a circle
around the skillet and in the center. Scatter the cranberries between
the slices.  You'll have enough slices to stack them 2 deep. Remove
the dough from the refrigerator and center it over the skillet. Using
scissors, trim the circle so that it overhangs 1/2-inch all around.
Tuck the edge down between the apples and the skillet. Lightly brush
the dough with cold water and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar.  Bake
about 40 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.  Remove from
oven and let sit on a cooling rack for 5 minutes.  Place a serving
dish over the skillet and flip the whole thing to invert the tart
onto the plate.  (Don't forget to put a potholder over the skillet
handle!)  Serve with ginger whipped cream.
