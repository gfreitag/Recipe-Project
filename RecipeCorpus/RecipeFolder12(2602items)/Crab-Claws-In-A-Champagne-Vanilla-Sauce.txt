Heat a large nonreactive sauté pan. When the pan is hot, add the

the pan from the heat when all of the butter is incorporated. In a
sauté pan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the claws and
remaining shallots. Sauté for 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and
pepper. Spoon the sauce in the center and around the rim of the
plate. Arrange the asparagus in the center of the sauce, forming a
