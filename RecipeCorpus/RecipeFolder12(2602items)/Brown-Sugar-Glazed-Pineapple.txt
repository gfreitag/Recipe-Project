Title: Brown Sugar Glazed Pineapple
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    To 2 medium size fresh
Pineapples
1/4 c  (packed) brown sugar
Port, optional
Preheat the broiler. Remove skin and "eyes" from pineapples and slice
into 3/4-inch rounds; remove core if you wish or just thickly coat
each slice with a layer of brown sugar. Set slices on a broiler pan.

Place the pan under the broiler as close to the heat as possible and
broil until the sugar is caramelized, about 3 minutes keep your eye
on the pineapple to make sure it does not burn.

Remove slices from the broiler pan and set on plates; garnish with
drops of port wine if you wish.
