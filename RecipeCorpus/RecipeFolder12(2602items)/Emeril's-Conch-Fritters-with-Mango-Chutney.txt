Categories: Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 2 Dozen
1 1/2 lb Conch meat
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Chopped onions
Essence of Emeril
1 tb Chopped garlic
3 ea Eggs; beaten
2 ts Baking powder
Salt
Cayenne
3 1/4 c  Flour
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 c  Mango chutney
Solid vegetable shortening
For deep-frying
Using a meat mallet, pound out the conch. Using a sharp knife, small
dice the conch. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add
the onions. Season with Essence and saute for about 3 minutes or
until slightly wilted. Season the conch with Essence. Add the conch
and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic. Remove and set aside to
cool.

Make a batter by combining the eggs, milk, baking powder, 1 teaspoon
of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne. Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a
time, beating and incorporating until all is used and the batter is
smooth. Stir in the parsley. Add the conch mixture to the batter and
fold to mix.

Heat the shortening to 360 degrees F. Drop the batter, a heaping
tablespoon at a time, into the hot oil. When the fritters pop to the
surface, roll them around with a slotted spoon to brown them evenly.
Remove and drain on paper towels.

Sprinkle the fritters with essence.

To serve: Spoon a pool of mango chutney in the center of each plate.
Arrange the fritters around the sauce. Garnish with parsley and serve
warm.
