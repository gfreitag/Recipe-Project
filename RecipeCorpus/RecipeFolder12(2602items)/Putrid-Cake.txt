anise, and set aside. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer cream
together the egg yolks, sugar, and orange zest on high speed for 5
minutes, it's texture should resemble mayonnaise. Reduce speed to
medium and drizzle in the oil, honey, and brandy. Reduce speed to low
and add the flour in 2 to 3 batches, beating only to incorporate the
flour. In a small bowl beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until
stiff, and add to the flour mixture. Pour into a well buttered 10
inch tube cake pan. Tap the pan on the counter 2 to 3 times to break
the large bubbles. Bake for 50 -55 minutes. Cool completely before
cutting. Garnish each slice with a slightly sweet whipped cream. The
cake will crack slightly on top and become very brown.
