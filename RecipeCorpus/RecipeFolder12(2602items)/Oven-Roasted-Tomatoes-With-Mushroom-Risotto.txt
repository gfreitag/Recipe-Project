Risotto:
1 tb Olive oil
2 tb Minced shallots
1 tb Minced garlic
*1/2 cup small diced yellow

2 c  Sliced wild mushrooms
2 c  Arborio rice
8 c  Mushroom broth

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the tomatoes: Rub each tomato
with the olive oil and season with Essence. Place on a baking sheet
and roast for 15 to 20 minutes. For the risotto: In a saute pan, heat
the olive oil. When the pan is smoking hot, saute the shallots,
garlic, and onions for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and continue
sauteing for 2 minutes. With a wooden spoon, stir in the rice and
saute for 1 minute. Add the mushroom broth 1/2 cup at a time until
all of the liquid is incorporated into the rice, stirring constantly,
about 10 minutes. Fold in the butter, cream and cheese. Season with
salt and pepper. Simmer the risotto for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the
tomatoes from the oven. Place the tomatoes on a platter. Spoon the
risotto into the center of each tomato. Top each tomato with a slice
of the Mozzarella cheese and place in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or
until the cheese starts to brown and melt over the tomato. Garnish
with the basil and Essence.
