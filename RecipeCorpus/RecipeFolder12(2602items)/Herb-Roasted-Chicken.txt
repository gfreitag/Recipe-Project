Title: Herb Roasted Chicken
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    (5 to 6) pound roasting
Chicken
4    Cloves garlic, crushed
1 md Onion, coarsely chopped
3    Bay leaves
1 tb Each of dried thyme,
Rosemary and sage
3 tb Olive oil
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper to taste
Several sprigs fresh thyme,
Rosemary and sage
1 c  Chicken broth
Butcher's twine
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and place a heavy roasting pan to
preheat in the oven.  Season the inside of the chicken cavity with
salt and pepper. Put the crushed garlic, chopped onion and dry herbs
inside the cavity of the chicken.  Using the twine, tie the legs
closed. Use the olive oil to rub the entire outside of the chicken
with an even coat of oil. Pick the herb from the stem and coarsely
chop them before sprinkling the herb liberally and evenly on the
chicken. Place the chicken into the preheated roasting pan and roast
at 425 degrees for the first 45 minutes of roasting. Reduce the oven
temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast for an additional 1
hour.  Remove from the oven and pierce the thigh: if the juices run
clear when pierced allow to rest on a platter for 15 to 20 minutes
before carving.  If the juices are still pink return to the oven for
more roasting time.

While the chicken is resting, place the roasting pan on top of the
stove, remove any chicken fat with a spoon, and, over medium heat,
deglaze the pan drippings with the chicken broth.  Use a spoon to
scrape up all the crusty bits (that's where the most concentrated
flavor is) and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and strain the
liquid into a gravy boat to pass at the table.
