Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Warm water (110 - 115)
1 ts Honey
2 ts Kosher salt
1 tb Dry active yeast
1/4 c  Plus 1 1/2 teaspoons
Extra-virgin olive oil, in
All
3 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 lb Fresh spinach (weighed
Before cleaning, please
Remove stem and
Clean thoroughly, then
Thinly slice the leaves)
2 c  Finely chopped onions
1 ts Chopped garlic
1 ts Ground cumin
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Crumbled Feta cheese
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a bowl combine water, honey, 1
teaspoon of the salt, and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Set aside
to foam. Then whisk in 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then sift 1 cup of
flour and mix well. Set aside for 1 hour, or until it has a
sponge-like texture. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat 2 1/2
tablespoons olive oil and saute onions until tender, about 5 minutes.
Then add the garlic, cumin, and remaining salt to the onions. Stir in
the spinach, in small batches, and cook until the spinach is soft.
Pour on the lemon juice. Drain spinach in a colander and reserve the
cooking liquid. In a large bowl, place 2 cups of the remaining flour,
making a well in the center of the flour. Pour the spongy mixture
into the well. Knead for 10 minutes, adding enough of the cooking
liquid to make it pliable yet firm. Transfer to a oiled bowl, cover
with plastic wrap and let rise for 2 hours. The add the feta cheese
to the dough and knead for 1 minute. Add the spinach mixture,
sprinkle with the remaining flour, and mix together quickly. The
dough is supposed to be moist and loose, don't knead again. Form into
a oblong loaf and place the dough on a well oiled baking sheet. Cover
lightly with plastic wrap and let proof for 1 hour. Bake the bread
for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and cook for
another 30 minutes.

Yield: 1 loaf
