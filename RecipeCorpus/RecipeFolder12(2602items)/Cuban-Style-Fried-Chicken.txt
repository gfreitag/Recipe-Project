Title: Cuban Style Fried Chicken
Categories: Toohot, Chicken
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Cumin seeds
3    Garlic cloves, peeled
2 ts Coarse salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
3    Fresh limes, juiced
2    Fresh oranges, juiced
1    Fresh grapefruit, juiced
1    Whole 2 1/2 pounds frying
Chicken, cut into pieces
Vegetable shortening for
Frying
1 1/2 c  Flour
To make the marinade, place the cumin seeds in a dry pan and toast
over medium heat, shaking pan until the seeds' aroma is released;
about one minute.  Combine the seeds with the garlic, salt and pepper
in a mortar and mash with a pestle to create a paste, or process in a
mini food processor or blender.  In a large bowl, mix the citrus
juices, then stir in the paste and combine well.  Immerse the chicken
pieces in the marinade and allow to sit for three hours or overnight.

When you're ready to cook the chicken, place the flour on a large
plate. Remove the marinated chicken pieces from the bowl and dredge
them in the flour; set aside.  Heat 1/2" to 3/4" shortening in a
large, heavy pan over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Place
chicken in the pan skin side down and fry 8 to 10 minutes per side
until lightly browned on all sides. Turn heat to medium low and
partially cover pan. Continue cooking, turning frequently until
cooked through, about 25 minutes. Remove chicken from oil and place
on a platter lined with paper towels to drain.
