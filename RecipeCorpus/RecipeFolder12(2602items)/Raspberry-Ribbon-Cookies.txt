Title: Raspberry Ribbon Cookies
Categories: Tvfn, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 x  The Ultimate Butter Cookie
Dough
2    To 3 tablespoons seedless
Raspberry jam
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1 ts Lemon juice
Prepare the Ultimate Cookie Dough and divide it into four equal
parts. Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes or refrigerate up to
4 days.

Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper, or use a clean, ungreased
baking sheet.

Remove one portion of the dough from the refrigerator and knead
lightly until it is pliable. Divide the dough into 2 parts. Shape
each part into a rope about 12 inches long by rolling between your
hands and the work surface. Place ropes on the baking sheet. Either
the side of your finger or with the handle of a wooden spoon, make an
indentation down the center of each strip.

Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Meanwhile, put the jam into a
small heavy duty zip-top plastic bag, (the type without a pleat).
Snip a small hole in the corner of the plastic bag and press jam down
the center of the partially baked cookies. Return to the oven and
bake 5 minutes longer or until the cookies are lightly browned.

Meanwhile, mix the powdered sugar, lemon juice and enough water to
make a frosting thin enough to drizzle over the cookies.

While the cookies are still warm, cut them diagonally into 1-inch
lengths. Drizzle with the frosting. Cool completely before removing
from the pan or from the parchment paper.

Yield: about 20 cookies
