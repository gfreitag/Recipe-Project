Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

For the beans: In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Saute the onions
and celery for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they are slightly wilted. Add
the beans, salt, cayenne, water and bay leaf and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium low and cook until beans are tender and most of
the water is absorbed, about 2 hours.

For the meats: In a large oven proof skillet, over medium high heat,
combine the flour and oil. Stirring constantly, make a medium brown
roux. Add the onions, celery, bell peppers, carrots, salt and
cayenne. Stirring constantly, cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until
vegetables are slightly wilted. Add the duck legs and sausages and
cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Add the chicken broth and stir
the mixture until the roux and broth are combined and mixture
thickens. Scrape the bottom and sides of the pot to loosen any brown
particles. Bring to a boil. Add the beans and duck meat. Reduce the
heat to medium low and cook for 30 minutes.

For the Gratine: In a mixing bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheese,
parsley, Essence, and olive oil. Mix well. When the bean meat mixture
is cooked, spoon the grantine evenly over the top and bake for 10
minutes or until lightly browned. Spoon a serving of the mixture from
the pan onto a plate and garnish with Essence, shaved chives and
crusty bread.
