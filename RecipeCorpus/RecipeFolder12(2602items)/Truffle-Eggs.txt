Title: Truffle Eggs
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Dozen eggs
1/2 c  Heavy cream
4 oz Grated White Cheddar cheese
Drizzle of truffle oil
Salt and white pepper
12    Sea scallops, cleaned
3 tb Butter
12 sl Crispy bacon
1    White truffle
In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, cream and half of the cheese
together. Season with salt and white pepper. Drizzle in truffle oil
to taste. Season the scallops with salt and pepper. In a large saute
pan, over medium heat, melt one tablespoon of butter. When the butter
has melted add the scallops and sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side
or until the scallops are slightly golden and have formed a nice
crust. In another large saute pan, over medium heat, heat the
remaining two tablespoons of the butter. When the butter has melted,
add the egg mixture and scramble the eggs for about 2 to 3 minutes or
until the eggs are soft and still runny. To assemble, place a
spoonful of the eggs in the center of the plate. Arrange three
scallops over the eggs. Lay three slices of bacon directly on top of
the scallops, forming short of a triangle hat. Sprinkle some of the
remaining cheese over the bacon. Garnish the plate with shaved
truffles, drizzle of truffle oil, and chives.
