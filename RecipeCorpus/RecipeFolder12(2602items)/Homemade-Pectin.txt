tender. Remove from the heat and cool. Line a large bowl with
dampened cheesecloth. Pour the pulp and juice through the
cheesecloth. Gather the corners of the cheesecloth, and tie in a
knot. Suspend from a cabinet knob or handle and allow to drip into a
bowl overnight. The next day, measure the apple juice and pour into a
large pot. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat and cook until
reduced by half. Refrigerate and use within 4 days or pour into
containers and freeze for up to 6 months.
