Title: White Chocolate Mousse with Kirsch
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
9 oz White chocolate cut into
Very small pieces
2 tb Water
3 tb Kirschwasser
1 1/2 c  Heavy whipping cream
Place chocolate, water, and Kirschwasser in a medium size heatproof
bowl. Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a wide skillet.  Turn the
heat off and wait 30 seconds.  Set bowl of chocolate in pan of water.
Stir white chocolate mixture constantly until melted and smooth. Or,
melt in a microwave on low for about 2 minutes.  Stir until smooth
and completely melted.  White chocolate is very fragile and burns
easily. Do not turn the heat on again under the skillet unless
absolutely necessary. Let cool until a dab touched by your upper lip
feels slightly cool.

Whip the cream until soft peaks form--not too stiff.  Carefully fold
cream into cooled white chocolate mixture; the mousse will seem very
soft. Scrape mold immediately into lined mold.  Mousse sets quickly
and should not be spread or manipulated too much after it is
completed.
