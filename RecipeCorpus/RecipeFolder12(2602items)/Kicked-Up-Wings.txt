Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 qt Vegetable oil for frying
2    Dozen chicken drumies
(chicken wings with small
Wing joint removed)
2 c  Crystal Hot Sauce
1 c  Sour cream
1/2 c  Heavy cream
Juice of one lemon
1 ts Minced shallots
1/2 ts Minced garlic
1/4 lb Crumbled Maytag Blue cheese
Salt and pepper
ds Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 c  Flour
2    Eggs, beaten with 1
TB milk
Essence
2    Carrots, peeled and cut into
3    Inch sticks
2    Celery stalks, peeled and
Cut into 3-inch sticks
Place the oil in a deep pan and heat the oil. Place the wings in a
glass bowl and pour over 1 cup hot sauce. Stir the wings to mix
thoroughly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour. In a mixing
bowl, combine the sour cream, cream, lemon juice, shallots, and
garlic. Blend until smooth. Stir in the crumbled cheese and blend
until smooth. Season the dip with salt, pepper, hot sauce, and
Worcestershire sauce. Season the flour with Essence. Dredge the wings
in the flour. Dip each wing in the egg wash, letting the excess drip
off. Dredge the wings in the seasoned flour for a second time,
coating the wing completely. Fry the wings in batches, until golden
brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the wings from the oil and drain
on paper-lined plate. Season the wings with salt and pepper. After
all the wings are fried, place the wings in a medium mixing bowl.
Pour the remaining hot sauce over the wings and toss to coat each
wing completely. Place the wings on a platter and serve with the blue
cheese dip, carrots, and celery.
