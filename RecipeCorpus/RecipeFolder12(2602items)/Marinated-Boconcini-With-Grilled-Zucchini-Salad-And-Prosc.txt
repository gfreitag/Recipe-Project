Drain the boconcini of the liquid it came in. In a mixing bowl, place
zucchini, 3 tablespoons olive oil, thyme, oregano, crushed red chili
flakes, and salt and pepper. Set aside at least 1 hour.

Place zucchini slices on the grill and cook until tender but not
really soft. Remove from grill and place in medium bowl. Add lemon
zest, whole chives, plum tomato pieces, vinegar and chopped parsley.
Toss gently to coat zucchini and divide among 4 plates. Place 3
boconcini on top of each pile of zucchini and set aside. Stack all
prosciutto directly on top of one another and cut across the slice
into matchstick julienne. Sprinkle over mozzarella and zucchini and
serve immediately.
