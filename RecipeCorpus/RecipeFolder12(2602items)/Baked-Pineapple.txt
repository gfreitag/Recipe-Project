Title: Baked Pineapple
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1    Ripe pineapple
1    Lime, cut into quarters
1 1/2 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut off the very top of the
pineapple and discard.  Place pineapple in a roasting pan.  Roast the
whole pineapple for about 1 hour, then remove from the oven and, as
soon as it is cool enough to handle, cut it first into 8 thick
rounds, crosswise. Cut these slices in half and arrange on a patter.
Squeeze the lime juice over the pineapple, dust with cayenne pepper,
and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. (Pineapple will dry out
if it is not roasted whole.  Diners should pick up the halfrounds of
pineapple with their hands and nibble the tender flesh from the
inside of the rind.)

Yield: 6 to 8 servings
