Title: Twice Baked Poblano Peppers
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6    To 8 poblano peppers
Peanut oil
4    To 5 yukon gold potatoes
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Heavy cream, scalded
Salt and pepper
1/8 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
2    Ears of corn, kernels

1/2 c  Shredded mozzarella or
Monterey Jack cheese
Rub poblanos with peanut oil and place under broiler until skin
begins to blacken slightly, and rotate for even cooking. Remove from
broiler and place in a plastic bag or in a bowl and cover with
plastic. This will allow peppers to sweat so skin can be removed.
Keep in bag for approximately 30 minutes. Remove skin by peeling,
stem can remain on. Slice open pepper on its side and remove seeds
and membranes.

Bring potatoes up to a boil in salted water and cook on simmer until
tender.

Remove and hand mash with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, scalded cream,
salt and pepper and grated cheese.

In a saute pan add 1/2 tablespoon butter and saute corn kernels
quickly with salt and pepper approximately 30 seconds on high heat.
Add to potato mixture.

Begin to fill peppers with potato mixture, being careful so as not to
break flesh.

Place on a sheet tray, top with shredded cheese and melt under
broiler.

Plate peppers using Jicama Slaw for accompaniment.
