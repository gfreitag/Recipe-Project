Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Ground nutmeg
2 ts Ground cayenne
1/2 c  Roasted and ground almonds
3/4 c  Panko bread crumbs
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
16    2-ounce pieces of halibut
1/3 c  Walnut oil
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Flour
4    Egg whites, slightly beaten
4 tb Olive oil
Thoroughly mix the nutmeg and the cayenne and set aside. In a bowl
combine the almonds, Panko and the cheese.

To prepare, brush the fish pieces lightly with the walnut oil.
Lightly salt and pepper each piece, then sprinkle the nutmeg-cayenne
mixture evenly over the fish. Dredge the fish in the flour and shake
off the excess. Next, thoroughly coat each piece in the egg whites
then dredge them in the almond mixture. Heat a sauté pan over medium
heat. Add the olive oil and sauté the fish sticks until they begin to
turn brown and crusty. Finish cooking the sticks in a 425 degree oven
for about 5 minutes or until the fish is firm to the touch.
