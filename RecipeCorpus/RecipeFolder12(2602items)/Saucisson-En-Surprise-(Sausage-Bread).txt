Categories: Emeril
Yield: 1 servings
1    Recipe Basic Bread Dough for
Stuffed Bread (see above
Recipe)
1    2-pound link fully-cooked
Garlic veal sausage
1    Egg, lightly beaten with 1
ts Water, for egg wash
Grease a baking sheet.  On a lightly-floured work surface, punch down
bread dough and roll into a 5x12-inch rectangle.  Place sausage in
center of dough and fold bread dough around sausage to completely
enclose, squeezing out any air pockets.  Brush edges with egg wash
before folding and sealing. Transfer to baking sheet, seam-side down,
and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Using a razor or serrated knife, cut a
shallow slit in center of dough, lengthwise, and brush with egg wash.
Bake bread until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Let bread cool in
pan on a rack 20 minutes, then turn out and let cool.  Serve warm or
at room temperature.
