Title: Bechamel Sauce
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Minced onion
4 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  All purpose flour
2 c  Milk
1/4 ts Salt
White pepper to taste
In a saucepan cook the onion in the butter over moderately low heat,
stirring, until it is softened. Stir in the flour and cook the roux,
stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the milk in a stream, whisking vigorously
until the mixture is thick and smooth, add the salt and the white
pepper, and simmer the sauce for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thickened
to the desired consistency. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve
into a bowl and cover the surface with a buttered round of waxed
paper to prevent a skin from forming.
