Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 lb Beef tenderloin, trimmed
2 tb Creole spice
Oil
4 lg Russet potatoes
2    Carrots, cut into 2-inch
Pieces
2 lg Turnips, halved
1 c  Beef stock
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Season meat with Creole spice. Heat a
large sautJ pan over high heat and sear meat well on all sides.
Transfer meat to a roasting rack set in a roasting pan and roast 15
minutes for medium-rare. Meanwhile "turn" vegetables, cutting them
into even-sized pieces shaped like footballs. Cook vegetables
separately in small pots of salted water just until tender, drain and
cool.

Transfer meat to a carving board, tent with foil to keep warm and let
rest at least 10 minutes. Remove rack from roasting pan, place pan
over medium high heat and pour in stock to deglaze. Bring to a boil,
scraping bottom of pan to incorporate any browned bits into sauce.
Simmer and adjust seasonings to taste. Add vegetables to stock to
reheat. Slice meat in thin slices. To serve, present meat in
"shingles", surround with vegetables and ladle sauce over.
