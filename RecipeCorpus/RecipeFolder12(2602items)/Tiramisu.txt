Title: Tiramisu
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
l  L/2 cups granulated sugar
l  Cup all-purpose flour
3/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 ts Baking powder
l  Teaspoon baking soda
L/4 teaspoon salt
4    Eggs, separated
2    Egg whites
3/4 c  Vegetable oil
L/2 cup water
l  Teaspoon vanilla extract
Sift together l cup sugar, the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt. Set aside.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, with paddle or beaters, beat
the egg yolks at high speed. Turn speed to low and pour in the oil,
water and vanilla. Gradually add the sifted ingredients, and when
almost incorporated, turn speed to medium, and beat until well
combined. Remove bowl from machine.

In another clean large bowl, with whip or beaters, whip the 6 egg
whites until soft peaks form. Start on medium speed and raise speed
as peaks begin to form. Gradually pour in the remaining l/2 cup sugar
and whip until whites are shiny and firm but not stiff. With a rubber
spatula, fold l/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then
scrape the chocolate mixture back into the whites, quickly folding
until completely incorporated.

Scrape the mixture into a greased and floured half-sheet pan and bake
until edges of the cake pull away from the pan and a tester, gently
inserted into the cake, comes out clean.
