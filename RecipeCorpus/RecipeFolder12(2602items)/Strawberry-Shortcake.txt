Follows
In a large bowl combine the strawberries and the granulated sugar and
with a potato masher mash the berries gently until they release their
juices, being careful not to crush them to a pulp. Let the mixture
stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.

In a bowl beat the heavy cream with the sour cream and the
confectioners' sugar until it holds a soft shape and beat in the
vanilla. Split the biscuits horizontally with a fork, arrange the
bottom halves on 4 plates, and spoon the strawberry mixture over
them. Top the strawberry mixture with some of the whipped cream and
arrange the biscuit tops on the cream. Serve the remaining cream
separately.
