Title: Pastry For Pork Pies
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
3/4 ts Baking powder
6 tb Solid vegetable shortening
1    Egg
1/2 c  Milk
Solid vegetable shortening
For deep-frying
Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a mixing bowl. Cut in the
shortening unit it resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl, beat the
egg with the milk. Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour
mixture, working it to make a thick dough. Divide the dough into 12
equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough pieces
into thin rounds, about 5 inches in diameter. Put about 1/4 cup of
the mixture in the center of each round, fold over and crimp the
edges with a fork. Heat the shortening a deep pot or an electric
deep-fryer to 360 degrees F. Fry the pies, two to three at a time,
until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.

Yield: 12 small pies
