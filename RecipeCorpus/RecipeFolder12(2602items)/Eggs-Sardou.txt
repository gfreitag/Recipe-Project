Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
6 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 1/2 lb Fresh spinach, finely
Chopped
Salt and white pepper
8 lg Fresh artichoke bottoms
1 ts Vinegar
8    Eggs
2 c  Warm hollandaise sauce
1 tb Chopped parsley
In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the
butter. Stir in the flour and mix well. Cook for 1 minute. Whisk in
the milk and cream slowly and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the
heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon,
about 3 minutes. Stir in the spinach and season with salt and pepper.
Continue to simmer for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
In another saute pan, over medium heat, melt the remaining butter.
Add the artichoke bottoms to the pan and saute for 2 minutes. (just
the heat the artichokes through) Season the artichokes with salt and
pepper. Cover the pan with a lid and remove from the heat. Bring a
pot of salted water to a boil. Add the vinegar to the water. Crack
each egg into a small cup. Carefully side one egg into the water.
When the water has come back to a slightly boil, side in another egg.
Continue the process until all the eggs are in the water. Reduce the
heat to a simmer and cook until the eggs are set, about 2 to 2 1/2
minutes. Remove the eggs from the water and drain on a paper-lined
plate. Season the eggs with salt and pepper. To assemble, spoon the
creamed spinach in the center of each artichoke bottom. Place the
filled artichokes on a platter. Lay the poached eggs directly on top
of the creamed spinach. Drizzle the hollandaise over the poached egg.
Garnish with parsley.
