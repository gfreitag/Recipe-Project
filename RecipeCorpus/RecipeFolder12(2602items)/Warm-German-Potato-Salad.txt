Pound)
1 md Onion, chopped

warm, covered.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet and saute onion over

sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and broth and simmer 2 minutes. Add
onion mixture to warm potatoes with parsley and remaining 1
tablespoon vinegar, tossing gently, and season with salt and pepper.

Serve potato salad warm or at room temperature, garnished with
parsley.
