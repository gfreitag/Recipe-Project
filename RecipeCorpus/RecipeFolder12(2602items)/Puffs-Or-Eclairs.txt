Title: Puffs Or Eclairs
Categories: Hot
Yield: 4 servings
1    Recipe pate a choux
1    Egg beaten with 1 teaspoon
Water or milk
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment. Pipe
out 1/2-inch balls for profiteroles or cocktail puffs, 1-inch balls
for cream puffs, or 1/2 by 4-inch strips for eclairs. Be sure to
leave enough room in between for them to triple in size. Brush with
egg glaze and bake for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 400 and open oven
door briefly to let steam out. Close the door and continue to bake
another 1030 minutes according to their size. They must be well dried
out or they may fall. Take one out of the oven and check it by
breaking open and checking the interior walls: they should be dry,
not wet and eggy. Return to the oven as necessary. Remove when done
and cool on a wire rack.

Yield: Approximately 30 medium puffs or 18 eclairs

Baked puffs and eclairs freeze well for up to a month.

Filling Puffs:

Either slice open horizontally, spoon filling onto bottom, and
replace the hat; or pierce a small hole with a paring knife in side
or bottom of the puff and pipe in a soft filling using a pastry bag
with a small plain tip.
