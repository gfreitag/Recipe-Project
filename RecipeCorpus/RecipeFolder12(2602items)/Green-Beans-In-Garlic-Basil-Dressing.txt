ts Total)
1    Recipe Garlic-Basil Dressing
(recipe follows)
5    Firm ripe tomatoes, sliced
4    Sprigs fresh basil for
Garnish
Leave the pointed tips on the green beans, but snap off the stem tips.
Wash. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the sugar and 1
tablespoon salt. Drop in the green beans and cook until crisp-tender,
about 6 to 7 minutes. Drain the beans and plunge them into ice water
to stop cooking. Drain well and refrigerate.

When ready to serve, toss the green beans with 1/3 cup of the
dressing in a large mixing bowl. Taste and add more dressing or salt
as needed. Pile the beans high in the center of a large white
platter. Arrange the tomato slices overlapping around the edge.
Sprinkle the tomatoes with salt and drizzle 3 tablespoons of the
dressing on top of them. Garnish with the basil sprigs. Serve
immediately.

*Note: This is one of the better ways to use canned beans if you
cannot get fresh. The dressing is flavorful enough to cover any
canned taste. Buy high-quality canned whole beans and rinse several
times.
