Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Olive oil
2 tb Minced shallots
1/4 c  Finely chopped red onion
3 tb Minced red peppers
1 tb Minced garlic
1/2 c  Homemade mayonnaise
3 tb Creole mustard
1 tb Crystal hot sauce
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 lb Crab meat, picked over for
Cartilage and shells
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
8    Soft-shell crabs
1 c  Seasoned flour
1    Egg slightly beaten with 2
TB milk
1 c  Seasoned bread crumbs
Oil for frying
1 c  Jalapeno homemade tartar
Sauce
1/2 c  Sizzled leeks (julienne
Leeks tossed in flour and
Fried until
Crispy then seasoned with
Essence)
1/4 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
2 tb Chopped chives
2 tb Brunoise red peppers
In a sauté pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is hot, sauté the
shallots, onions, peppers, and garlic until slightly wilted, about 2-3
minutes. Remove from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl. Stir in the
mayonnaise, Creole mustard, Crystal hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce,
crab meat and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Stuff each crab
with 3 ounces of filling. Dredge the soft-shells in the seasoned
flour. Dip into the egg wash, removing any excess. Dredge in the
seasoned bread crumbs, crusting each side completely. In a sauté pan,
pour in enough oil to fill 1/4 of the pan. When the oil is hot, add
the soft-shells in batches. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side or until
the soft-shells are golden brown and heated through the center.
Remove from the pan and drain on a paper-line plate. Continue frying
until all the soft-shells are fried. Season with Essence. Spoon the
tartar sauce in the center of the plate and around the rim. Place two
soft-shells against each other in the center of the sauce. Pile the
leeks on top of the soft-shells. Garnish with the cheese, chives, and
peppers.
