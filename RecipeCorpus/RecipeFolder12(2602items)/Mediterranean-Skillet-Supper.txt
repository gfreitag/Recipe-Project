toasty brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broth, cover and cook

but has not absorbed all of the water, remove the cover and cook for
another few minutes, stirring occasionally until the excess moisture
has evaporated. Add the sundried tomatoes and pesto; season to taste
with salt and pepper. Add the chick peas, cover and cook for about 5
minutes or until the chick peas are heated through. Adjust seasoning.
Serve with sour cream or plain yogurt as a topping.
