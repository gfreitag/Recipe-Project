Title: Colorado Stuffed Rack Of Lamb
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4    Colorado Rack of Lamb
Essence
3 c  Lamb rillette
1 c  Creole Mustard
1 c  Fine dried bread crumbs
2 tb Olive oil
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Slice the racks into chops and
season the entire chop with Essence. Place the chops on the grill and
cook for 1 minute on each side. Remove from the grill and cool. Using
a sharp knife, make a slit on the side of each chop about 1 1/2
inches long and deep, forming a pocket. Stuff each chop with 1/4 cup
of the lamb rillette. Smear each chop with Creole Mustard. In a
mixing bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the olive oil. Season the
crumbs with Essence. Mix the crust thoroughly. Place the chops in an
oven-proof pan. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs over each chop.
Place the chops in the oven and roast the chops for 6 to 8 minutes
for medium rare. Remove the chops from the oven and rest for about 2
minutes before serving.

Yield: 12 stuffed chops
