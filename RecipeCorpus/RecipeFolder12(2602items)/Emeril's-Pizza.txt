Title: Emeril's Pizza
Categories: Emeril, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Yeast
1 c  Warm water (110 degrees)
1/4 c  Olive oil
3    4 cups flour
2 ts Salt
1 lb New potatoes, thinly sliced,
Blanched
1 c  Julienned red onions
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Salt and white pepper
1/2 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
Drizzle of truffle oil
2 tb Chopped chives
Preheat the oven 400 degrees. In an electric mixer, whisk the yeast,
water, and oil, together, to form a paste. Using a dough hook, add
the flour and salt to the paste, mix the dough until the dough comes
away from the sides and crawls up the sides of the hook. Remove the
dough from the bowl and turn the dough into a greased bowl, cover.
Let the dough rise until double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough
out onto a floured surface and divide into 4 (4-ounce) balls, cover.
Let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes. Press each dough out into a
10-inch circle about 1/2 -1-inch thick. Lightly brush the dough with
olive oil. Divide the potatoes into four portions and season with
salt and pepper. Cover the each dough with the potatoes, leaving a
1-inch border. In a small mixing bowl, toss the red onions with the
extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place a layer of
the red onions on top of the potatoes. Sprinkle each pizza with the
grated cheese. Drizzle each pizza with the truffle oil. Bake for
15-20 minutes or until the crust is crispy and golden brown. Garnish
the pizza with chives.
