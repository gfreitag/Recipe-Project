Title: Apple Cake In A Jar
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Allspice
2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 ts Baking soda
2/3 c  Vegetable shortening
2 1/3 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
2 c  Applesauce
1 c  Chopped walnuts
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease twelve 1/2-pint wide-mouth
canning jars with a paper towel dipped in shortening.

Sift flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and
baking soda into a large bowl. Using the electric mixer and a medium
mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar on low speed,
then increase to medium speed to mix well. While the mixer is
running, add the eggs, one at a time. Stop the mixer and scrape down
the sides. Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the applesauce.
With a large spoon, stir in the sifted flour mixture and the walnuts.
Pour the batter into a measuring cup with a spout; pour the batter
neatly into the greased jars. Fill the jars halfway full. Place the
filled jars on the sheet tray and bake on the center rack of the oven
for 45 minutes. When done, the top of the cake will spring back when
pressed with a finger, and the sides will have come away from the jar.

Remove from oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes. Cake will still be
warm, but not hot. Place a circle of waxed paper on top of the jar
and seal with the jar lid. Pack carefully so as not to break the
glass.

Yield: 12 cakes
