oil. Dredge the beef in flour and shake off excess.  Over high heat,
sear the beef for about 2 3 minutes per side or until golden brown
all over. With a slotted spoon remove the beef to a plate, keep warm,
loosely covered with foil. In the remaining fat in the casserole,
saute the onions for about 10 to 15 minutes or until brown and
tender. Remove the casserole from the heat and add the garlic, tomato
paste, mustard, thyme, grated lemon, bay leaves and salt and pepper
to taste.  Add the grated carrot and celery, wine, and broth.  Return
the beef to the casserole.  Bring the liquid to a boil, cover and set
in the oven for 1 1/ 2 hours or until fork tender. Stir the beef on
occasion.

When done, transfer the beef to the top of the stove.  Remove the
surface fat, discard bay leaves and season to taste with salt and
pepper. Make the vegetable garnish for the first night.  To serve,
ladle stew in center of a large deep platter.  Wreath the meat with
the sauteed vegetable garnish and sprinkle parsley over meat.
