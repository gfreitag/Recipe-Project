Categories:
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM-----------------ESSENCE OF EMERIL #EE2425----------------------
1/4 c  Olive oil
1    Whole duck (about 3-5
Pounds), cut into 8 pieces
Essence
1/4 c  Flour
3 c  Julienned onions
3 oz Finely chopped Tasso
3 c  Sliced assorted wild
Mushrooms, such as Shiitakes
Oysters, and
Chantrelles
1 c  Red wine
2 c  Dark chicken stock
2 tb Chopped green onions
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
In a cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil. Season the duck pieces
with Essence. When the oil is hot, sear the duck for 2-3 minutes on
each side. Remove the duck from the skillet and set aside. Stir in
the flour and cook for 5-7 minutes for a medium brown roux. Add the
onions, Tasso and mushrooms. Saute for 3 minutes. Season with salt
and pepper. Add the duck pieces back to the skillet. Add the red wine
and stock. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer.

Continue cooking for 30-35 minutes or until the duck meat is tender.
Turn the duck pieces in the sauce every 10 minutes to prevent the
meat from drying out. Stir in the green onions. Adjust the seasonings
if needed.
