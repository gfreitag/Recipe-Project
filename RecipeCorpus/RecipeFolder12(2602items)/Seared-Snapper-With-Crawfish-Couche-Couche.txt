Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a saute pan, heat 2 tablespoon
olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions and saute for 2
minutes. Season with Essence. Add the corn and continue to saute for
1 minute. Add the garlic and crawfish and continue to saute for 1
minute. Season with Essence. Remove from the heat and cool. In a
mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, sugar, baking powder,
and cayenne. Add the egg, milk and chicken stock and mix well, but do
not beat. Fold in the crawfish mixture. In a 10-inch cast iron
skillet over medium heat, add the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot
and almost smoking, pour in the batter and cook for 3 to 4 minutes,
or until the edges begin to turn golden. Place the skillet in the
oven and bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove
from the oven and cool. Break the couche couche into pieces. Season
the snapper with Essence. In a large skillet, heat the remaining
olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the snapper and sear for 3 to 4
minutes on each side. Remove the snapper from the pan and drain on
paper-lined plate. Place the couche couche in the center of each
plate. Lay the fish directly on top of each of the couche couche and
spoon the Tasso Maque Choux over the top.
