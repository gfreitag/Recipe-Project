Title: Caramel Cup Custard
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
3    Eggs
1 c  Heavy cream
3/4 ts Vanilla extract
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a nonreactive saucepan, combine
1 cup sugar and lemon juice. Cook the sugar until it dissolves and
turns smooth and brown, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove
from the heat and spoon 1 tablespoon of the caramel into 4 (6-ounce)
ramekins. Place the ramekins in a baking pan. In a mixing bowl, whisk
the eggs, cream, vanilla and remaining sugar together, until the
sugar dissolves. Pour the egg/cream mixture into each ramekin. Fill
the baking pan with enough water to reach three quarters of the way
up the sides of the cups. Bake the custards for 1 hour, or until the
custards are set. Remove the custards from the oven and cool.
Refrigerate the custards for at least 4 hours. Loosen the custards
and invert onto a small plate. Garnish with whipped cream and fresh
mint.
