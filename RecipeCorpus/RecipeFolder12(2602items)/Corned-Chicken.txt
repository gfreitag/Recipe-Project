MMMMM----------------------JOHN ASH #JA9764---------------------------
3/4 c  Sea salt
2 1/2 qt Water
1/3 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
3 lg Garlic cloves, crushed
12    Whole cloves
1 ts Nutmeg, grated
1 1/2 tb Crushed juniper berries
3 1/2 lb Chicken
Combine salt and water in a large sauce pan and simmer until salt
dissolves. Remove from heat and stir in the brown sugar, garlic,
cloves, nutmeg and juniper berries. Let mixture cool to room
temperature.

Put chicken in a nonaluminum bowl or pot and pour the salt mixture
over, adding additional water, if necessary, to barely cover the
chicken. Cover and store refrigerated, turning the chicken once each
day for four days.

Drain chicken, rinse well and cover with cold water. Weight chicken if
necessary to keep it submerged and let it stand covered in the
refrigerator for 6 hours. During this time change the water four
times.

Drain chicken, pat dry, truss and roast it on a rack in a preheated
375 degree oven for one hour or until the juices run clear.

Recommended Wine: A fruity Riesling, Gewurztraminer or Chenin Blanc
with a little residual sugar will play off the sweetsalty "corned"
flavors of the chicken.
