Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2    Eggs
2/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
3 1/4 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Milk
1/2    Stick butter, melted
Vegetable oil, for
Deep-frying
Honey or Chocolate Glaze
(recipes follow) or
Confectioners' sugar or
Cinnamon-sugar
In a large mixing bowl beat eggs, sugar and vanilla until thick and
smooth. In another bowl combine flour, baking powder, spices and
salt. Whisk together milk and butter. Add flour mixture and milk
mixture alternately to egg mixture, in about 3 additions of each,
stirring to form a firm dough. Roll out dough 1/2- inch thick. Use a
doughnut cutter or 3-inch and 1/2 inch biscuit cutters to cut out
doughnut shapes.

Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 360 degrees. Fry doughnuts, in batches,
turning them several times, until golden all over. Using a slotted
spoon remove doughnuts to a rack set over a baking sheet to drain. If
using Honey Glaze, immediately spoon over hot doughnuts, letting
excess drain onto sheet below.; if using Chocolate Glaze, allow
doughnuts to cool slightly first. Or let doughnuts cool and dredge in
confectioners' sugar or cinnamon-sugar. Yield: 1 1/2 dozen Doughnuts
