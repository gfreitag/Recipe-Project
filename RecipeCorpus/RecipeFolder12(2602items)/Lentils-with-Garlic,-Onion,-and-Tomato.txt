Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Mung dal (split mung beans,
Yellow in color) or 2 1/2
c  Cooked
Mung dal
4 c  Water
1/2 ts Turmeric
1    Bay leaf
1    Inch cinamon stick
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Vegetable oil
2    3 cloves garlic, finely
Chopped
1    Medium-sized onion, finely
Chopped
2    Medium-sized tomatoes,
Chopped
You will need a medium-sized saucepan, and a large deep skillet or
saucepan.

To cook split mung beans, rinse off with cold water and then place in
a saucepan with four cups of water, turmeric, bay leaf, and cinnamon.
Bring to a boil, then simmer until tender, approximately 20 to 25
minutes. Stir in salt.  Serve hot, with a stack of chapatis.

To make Dal Fry:

In another large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over high heat.
Toss in the garlic and onion and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the chopped
tomatoes and cook for one minute longer, stirring the entire time.
Now pour in the cooked mung dal and stir (watch out for spattering as
the dal first hits the oil).  Cook the dal for 2 to 3 minutes, or if
the dal was cold or at room temperature, cook until hot. Serve
immediately in individual bowls or in one large bowl.

This easy dish is very quick to make and a welcome accompaniment for
flatbreads.  Dal (split mung beans) is quickly cooked with a little
turmeric, cinnamon, and bay leaf to make a satisfying soupy stew. It
can also be served as a dal fry, fried with a little garlic, onion,
and tomato. Either way, it should come to the table piping hot, an
ideal companion for fresh chapatis.
