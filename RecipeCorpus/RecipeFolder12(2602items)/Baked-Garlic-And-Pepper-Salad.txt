Title: Baked Garlic And Pepper Salad
Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
DRESSING
3 tb Sherry vinegar
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/3 c  Olive oil
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
2    Heads garlic
3    Red bell peppers
3    Green bell peppers
6    Tomatoes
Olive oil
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, and olive
oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready to
use.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Cut 1/2-inch off the tops of the heads of garlic, so the cloves are
just visible. Rub the heads of garlic, bell peppers and tomatoes with
olive oil to coat them. With a paring knife, cut a cross across the
stem end of each tomato. Place all the vegetables on a baking sheet
and roast for 30 to 40 minutes, turning every 10 minutes.

Immediately place all the vegetables in a large bowl, cover with
plastic wrap and leave to cool, about 30 minutes. Peel the peppers
and tomatoes, remove the seeds, and cut vegetables into strips.
Squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins. Arrange the vegetables on
a large serving platter, or on individual plates, season with salt
and pepper to taste, and drizzle with the reserved dressing.
