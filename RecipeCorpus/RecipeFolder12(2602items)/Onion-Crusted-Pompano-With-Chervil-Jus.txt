Title: Onion Crusted Pompano With Chervil Jus
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 lg Vidalia onions, shaved into
1/4    -inch rings
1/4 c  Dijon mustard
1 tb Essence
4    (6 ounce) pompano fillets
1/4 c  Bacon fat
3 c  Chicken stock
1/4 c  Chopped fresh chervil
1 ts Minced shallots
1 ts Minced garlic
Salt and pepper
3 c  Mashed potatoes, hot
1/2 c  Red pepper paint, hot
Fresh chervil sprigs
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Season each filet with Essence.
Lightly rub each fillet with the Dijon mustard. Using a cloth napkin,
folded in half, cover the bottom half of the napkin with a fourth of
the shaved onion. Place the fillet directly on top of the shaved
onions. Roll the fish up tightly to the end. This will secure the
crust around the fish. In a saute pan, heat the bacon fat. When the
fat is hot, sautÂ‚ the fish for 3 minutes on one side, or until the
onions are seared and crispy. Flip the fish over and finish cooking
in the oven. Roast the fish for 8-10 minutes or until the fish is
done. In a sauce pot, combine the chicken stock, chervil, shallots,
and garlic. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
Simmer the liquid for 25-30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Remove from the heat. Remove the fish from the oven. Mound the
potatoes in the center of the plate. Place the crusted fish directly
on top. Spoon the sauce around the fish. Garnish with the red pepper
paint on the rim and fresh chervil.
