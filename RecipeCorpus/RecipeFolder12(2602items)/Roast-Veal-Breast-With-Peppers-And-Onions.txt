Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    Veal breast with bones
Attached
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 lb Cipollini or small white
Onions, peeled
2    Red peppers, seeded and
Quartered
2    Yellow peppers, seeded and
Quartered
1 c  White wine
Trim any excess fat and gristle from the veal. Heat a large casserole
on the stove top and add the olive oil. Season the veal well with
salt and pepper and add to the hot casserole. Brown well on both
sides turning only when fully caramelized. Remove the veal and set
aside. Add the cipollini to the pot and brown well before adding the
peppers. When the vegetables are well browned, put the veal back into
the pot, add the wine. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover with a
tight fitting lid. Allow to cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, checking
occasionally that the pot has not cooked dry. If it has, add some
water to keep the pot moist throughout the cooking process. When
cooked slice and serve with vegetables.
