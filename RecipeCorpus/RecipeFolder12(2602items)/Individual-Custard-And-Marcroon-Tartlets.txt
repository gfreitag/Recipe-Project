Categories: Emeril
Yield: 12 servings
Pastry tart shells in
Ramekins
2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Sugar
1    Vanilla bean, split in half
4    Egg yolks
12 sm Coconut macaroons
1 c  Sweetened whipped cream
Fresh mint sprigs
Powdered sugar in a shaker
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut out 12 pastry rounds 3 inches
larger than the diameter of the ramekins and pat into the small
ramekins. Line the pastry with foil and weight down with dried beans,
rice or pie weights and bake for 5 to 8 minutes or until pastry is
light golden brown. Remove the foil and beans and set ramekins aside.
In a sauce pot, combine the cream, sugar, scraped vanilla bean and
vanilla bean. Bring the cream up to a simmer to dissolve the sugar.
Simmer for about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the
vanilla bean. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until frothy.
Temper the cream into the yolks. Place a macaroon in the center of
each pie shell. Pour the custard into the shells. Place the ramekins
in a warm water bath. Bake for 20 minutes or until the custard is set
and the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven. Serve cold.
Garnish with the whipped cream, mint, and powdered sugar.
