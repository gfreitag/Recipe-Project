Title: Fresh Peach Muffins With A Pecan Crumb Topping
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Finely chopped fresh or
Frozen peaches
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, at room
Temperature
2    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Milk
4 c  Flour
4 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Ground pecans
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
4 tb Cold butter
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly Grease 24 (2 3/4-inch by 1
3/8-inch) muffin cups. Place the peaches in a bowl and cover with 1/2
cup of the sugar. Mix thoroughly. Allow the peaches to sit for 1
hour. Using an electric mixer, fitted with a paddle, cream the butter
and remaining 3/4 cup of sugar until smooth and pale in color, about
3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until fluffy, about
2 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of the flour, baking
powdered, and salt. Remove the bowl from the mixer and alternately
fold in the milk and flour mixture, being careful not to over mix.
Fold in the peaches. Spoon 1/4 cup of the filling into each prepared
muffin cup. In a small bowl, combine the remaining flour, brown
sugar, pecans, and cinnamon. Mix well. Add the butter. Using your
hands, mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumb like mixture.
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the crumb mixture over each muffin cup.
Place in the oven and bake for about 15 to 20 minutes or until golden
brown. Serve warm with butter.

Yield: 2 dozen muffins
