1    Bay leaf
8    Peppercorns
1/2 ts Chopped fresh thyme

8 oz Cold butter, cubed

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a saucepan, combine the wine,
lemon juice, peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring the liquid to a
boil and reduce by half, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream and
bring the liquid back to a boil and reduce by half, about 2 to 3
minutes. Whisk in the butter, a cube at a time, until all the butter
is incorporated. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Strain the
sauce through a fine mesh strainer and keep warm. Bring a small pot
of salted water to a boil. Blanch the lemon and orange zest for 1
minute. Remove the zest from the water and shock in an ice bath.
Remove the zest from the ice bath and pat dry. In a mixing bowl,
combine the horseradish, blanched zest, lemon juice, orange juice,
and cilantro. Season the crust with the kosher salt and sugar. Season
the fillets with Essence. Rub the top of each plank with olive oil.
Place one fillet on each plank. Divide the crust in half and cover
the top of each fillet with the crust. Place the planks on a sheet
pan and place in the oven. Bake the fillets for 12 to 15 minutes or
until the crust is golden and the fish is flaky. Serve the planks
with butter sauce. Yield: 2 servings
