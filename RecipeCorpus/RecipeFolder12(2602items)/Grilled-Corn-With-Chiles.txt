Preheat the grill. Pull down the corn husks, but don't remove them.
Extract the silk and rewrap the husks around the corn. Soak the ears
in cold water for 30 minutes.

In a blender or food processor, combine the remaining ingredients.
Pulse intermittently to make a paste.

Remove the corn from the water, pull back the husks and drain
thoroughly. Spread the paste over the kernels. Rewrap the husks, then
arrange the corn on the hot grill. Cook, turning often, for about 15
minutes, or until the husks are lightly charred. Serve in the husks.

Optional serving style: After removing corn from water, drain, rewrap
in husks and grill. When done, remove from grill, cut corn into 1
inch rings and toss with the chile paste. Serve in a bowl.
