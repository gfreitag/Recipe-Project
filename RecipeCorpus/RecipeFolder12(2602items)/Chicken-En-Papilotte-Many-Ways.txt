Title: Chicken En Papilotte Many Ways
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4    Skinless, boneless chicken
Breast halves, tenderloins
Removed
3 tb Green or black olive paste
1 tb Vegetable oil
3    (12 ounces) new potatoes,
Washed
2    Ripe tomatoes
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
4 sm Tomatoes, washed and cored
And sliced
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Rub the olive paste on both sides of
each chicken breast half.

Cut the potatoes into 1/16th-inch slices and thinly slice the
tomatoes. Set 4 12-inch squares of foil on the counter. Lightly oil
the center of each piece of foil and spread some potato slices in the
middle; season them with salt and pepper. Cover the potatoes with a
chicken breast half, then cover with more potato slices, salt and
pepper and the tomato slices. Wrap the chicken airtight, in a deli
sandwich wrap, and set the packages on a baking sheet. Bake for 30
minutes.

When the chicken is done unwrap the packages carefully (be careful the
steam which will escape when you open the packages does not burn your
hands.) Transfer the chicken, potatoes, tomatoes and the natural
juices to deep plates.

Variations: Instead of the potatoes spread 1/2 cup drained canned
white beans, a couple of slivers of fresh garlic, a leaf or two of
fresh sage and a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil underneath the
chicken. Top the chicken with the tomatoes. Or spread each chicken
breast half with 1 teaspoon each of oriental sesame oil, soy sauce
and rice vinegar. Top each chicken breast half with 1/2 cup sliced
jicama; 1 cup raw fresh spinach and 1 sliced scallion. Open and
garnish with sesame seeds. Or, instead of the green olive paste and
tomatoes, season each chicken breast half with barbecue sauce or
ketchup and top with 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels; leave the
potatoes in (especially good for kids)
