Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Melted semisweet chocolate
2    Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla
1 3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Plus 5 tablespoons melted
Butter
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Sugar
2 pt Fresh raspberries
ds Grand Marnier
2 c  Sweetened whipped cream
Shaker of powdered sugar
In a mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another
bowl beat the chocolate, egg yolks and vanilla slightly. Beat the
milk and 1/2 cup of the butter into the egg mixture. Fold the flour
mixture into the egg mixture. Stir until combined yet still slightly
lumpy. In a small bowl beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
Gently fold beaten egg whites into batter , leaving little fluffs of
egg whites. Pour 1 cup batter onto grids of a preheated, lightly
greased waffle iron (grease the waffle iron with 2 tablespoons of the
butter, in all). Close lid quickly: do not open during baking. Bake
according to the manufacturer's directions for the waffle iron. In a
saute pan, melt the remaining butter. Add the sugar, stirring
constantly until the sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Add the
raspberries and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and
add the Grand Marnier. Flame the liquor and continue to cook for 1
minute. Serve the waffles with the raspberry syrup and sweetened
whipped cream. Garnish with powdered sugar.
