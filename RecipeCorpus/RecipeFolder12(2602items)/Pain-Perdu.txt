Working over a mixing bowl, zest the orange. Cut the orange in half
and squeeze the juice. Mix the juice with the zest. Add the eggs,
milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar and vanilla. Whisk to dissolve the
sugar.

In a saute pan, heat two tablespoons of the butter. Dip two slices of
the bread into the egg mixture, coating each side evenly. Fry the
bread in the butter for 2-3 minutes on each side. Repeat the process
until all the butter and bread are used.

In another saute pan, melt the two tablespoons of cold butter. When
the butter has melted, add the brown sugar and stir until dissolved.
Add the bananas and saute for 1-2 minutes. Add the rum and flame the
bananas.

Place two slices of sauteed banana bread in the center of a serving
plate. Pour some of the warm maple syrup over the bread and spoon
some of the warm bananas over the syrup. Garnish with whipped cream
and powdered sugar.
