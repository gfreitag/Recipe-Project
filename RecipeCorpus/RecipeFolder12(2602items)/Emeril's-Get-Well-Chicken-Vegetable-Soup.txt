Heat oil in a large heavy soup pot over high heat.  Add chicken meat
and bones, salt, and 10 turns of pepper, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until meat and bones are brown, about 5 minutes.  Add
onions, celery, carrots, green onions, garlic, parsley, basil, bay
leaves and Creole seasoning and cook, stirring once or twice, about 4
minutes. Add chopped vegetables, spinach and crushed red pepper and
cook 1 minute more.

Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer,
uncovered, about 25 minutes.  Remove carcass and loose bones. Add
noodles, bring back to a boil, and simmer 5 minutes. Refrigerate
overnight, if possible.  It'll taste even better if you do.

Serve 1 1/3 cups per bowl and freeze any extra servings.
