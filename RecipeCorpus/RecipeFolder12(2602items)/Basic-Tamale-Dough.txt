Title: Basic Tamale Dough
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Fresh Masa (ask for coarsely
Ground) or 4 1/2 cups Masa
Harina and
4    To 5 cups warm Caldo de
Pollo, plus more as needed
1 lb Lard (preferably
Non-hydrogenated and without
Preservatives)
2 1/2 tb Salt
If using fresh Masa, set aside. If using Masa Harina, place it in a
large bowl and reconstitute by adding 4 cups warm stock. Beat with a
wooden spoon or mix with your hands until you have a stiff, smooth
dough like a medium-pliable bread dough. Use a little more stock if
necessary, but the mixture should not be loose. Beat the lard in a
large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until very fluffy
and fully aerated, about 3 minutes. It may take longer if your mixer
is not powerful (a heavy-duty machine such as a Kitchen Aid is best).
The best alternative to a mixer is not a spoon but your bare hand;
whip and beat the lard with a rapid folding motion until you feel it
lightening, and continue to whip until it is fluffy and full of air.
It should be as light as butter creamed for the lightest butter cake.
Still mixing on medium speed, begin adding the Masa, a handful at a
time. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula
as necessary. Alternatively, beat in the Masa using your bare hand as
a whipping and folding tool. If the mixture becomes too stiff to
beat, add up to 1 cup tepid chicken or pork stock, a little at a
time. When all the Masa has been incorporated, the mixture should be
very light and delicate, the texture of buttercream frosting. Beat in
the salt. The mixture is now ready to be spread onto corn husks,
banana leaves, or other wrappers and steamed
