Title: Vanilla Tuile And Fruit Compote
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
10 oz Unsalted butter
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1    Vanilla bean, scraped
6    Egg whites (large AA)
2 c  All-purpose flour
In a standing mixer with paddle, cream butter and sugar until light
and fluffy. Split and scrape vanilla bean into the mixture. *Do not
use pod - only the seeds. Mix well and add whites and flour. Mix well
and chill covered with plastic wrap, preferably overnight. *Use pod
for compote.

Fruit Compote: 1 cup dried cherries 1 cup dried figs 1 cup dried
pears, sliced 1/2 cup dried currants or blueberries 2 cups dry white
wine 1 vanilla bean pod
1/2    cup granulated sugar

Combine all ingredients in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool
in pan. Remove all fruit and reduce sauce until syrup-like. Combine
with fruit. Remove pod and set aside until ready to assemble.

Baking: Spread about 1 teaspoon cold tuille batter thinly over
stencils (professional or homemade) on greased back of cookie sheet.
Place tuiles in 350 degree F oven. Tuiles will spread and cook
rapidly. Therefore, test a few, one at a time, for appropriate
thinness of batter and length of cooking time. If tuiles have spread
too much, reduce amount of batter and make sure batter is spread
evenly and thinly. Tuiles should be removed from oven when slightly
golden. Let set for a few seconds on sheet before removing to rack
for cooling.

Assemble Napoleon by layering tuiles and fruit compote. Top with ice
cream, frozen yogurt, or whipped cream.
