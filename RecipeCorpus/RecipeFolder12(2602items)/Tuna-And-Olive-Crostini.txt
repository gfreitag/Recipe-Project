Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
12    (1-inch) slices of a French
Baguette
Drizzle of olive oil
1    (8-ounce) tuna steak
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Kalamata olives, about 20,
Pitted
1/2    Anchovy fillet
1/2 ts Chopped garlic
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a mixing bowl, toss the bread
slices with olive oil, coating each side completely.

Season the bread with salt and pepper.  Place the bread on a baking
sheet and bake until crispy and slightly golden brown, about 6 to 8
minutes. Remove the croutons from the oven and place on a large
plate. Season the tuna steak with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place
the tuna on a hot grill and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes on each
side for medium-rare. Combine all of the remaining ingredients in a
food processor and puree for 15 seconds or until the mixture is
smooth. Slice the tuna into 12 equal slices and place one slice on
top of each crouton. Dab a spoonful of the Tapenade on top of each
tuna slice. Garnish with chopped chives.

Yield: 1 dozen crostinis
