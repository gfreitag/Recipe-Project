In a large pot, over medium heat, add the bacon and render until

for 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the garlic
and beans and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the cane syrup, brown sugar,
ketchup and mustard. Season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.
Stir in the chicken stock. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a

occasionally. From time to time, one might need to add a little water
at a time if the beans need some to prevent burning.
