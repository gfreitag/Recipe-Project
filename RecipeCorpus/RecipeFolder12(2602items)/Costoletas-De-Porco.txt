2    Serrano chiles, stemmed,

1 ts Minced habanero chile
2 tb Fruity olive oil
In a small glass or ceramic bowl, whisk together the shallots, thyme,
chile, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Drizzle the oil over in a thin
stream, whisking all the time, until the mixture is emulsified. Set
aside, covered and refrigerated, for up to 4 hours.

Trim off any excess fat from the chops and place them in a shallow
ceramic or glass roasting dish that will hold them all in one layer.

In a nonreactive bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, salt,
pepper, chile, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Pour the marinade
over the chops, coating both sides, cover and marinate in the
refrigerator for at least 1 and up to 3 hours.

Bring the chops to room temperature for 15 minutes before cooking, and
shake dry. In a large castiron skillet, or in 2 skillets if
necessary, heat the remaining tablespoon oil over mediumhigh heat and
cook the chops for 5 to 7 minutes on each side (the chops could also
be broiled or grilled). Serve immediately, garnished with thyme
vinaigrette.
