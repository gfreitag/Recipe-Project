1 c  Virgin olive oil

flour and fry in hot oil until golden brown.  Remove and drain on
paper towels.

Add onions and cook until softened and just light brown, 10 to 12
minutes. Add currants, sugar, pine nuts and vinegar and bring to
boil. Cook 5 to 6 minutes until currants are soft and allow to cool.
When all ingredients are cool, choose an earthenware dish that just
fits the fried fillets, slightly overlapping.  Top with sweet and
sour mixture and refrigerate for 24 hours. Serve at room temperature.
