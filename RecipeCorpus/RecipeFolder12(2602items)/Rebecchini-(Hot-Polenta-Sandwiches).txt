Title: Rebecchini (Hot Polenta Sandwiches)
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Cookie sheet
3 c  Water
1 ts Salt
1 c  Polenta, finely ground or
Quick cooking
8    Anchovies, salt packed
4 tb Virgin olive oil
4    Cloves garlic, thinly
Sliced
2 tb Capers, rinsed and drained
Olive oil for frying
1/2 c  Flour -- on a plate
3    Eggs, beaten in a shallow
Bowl
Brush cookie sheet with vegetable oil and set aside.  In a medium
saucepan, heat water to boil and add salt.  Whisking vigorously, pour
in polenta slowly in a thin stream and then cook until quite thick,
about 1 minute, switching to a wooden stick to stir as the polenta
thickens. Pour polenta out on to cookie sheet and spread out flat
until it covers the sheet, about 1-8- to 1/4-inch thick. Allow to
cool 1 hour.

Rinse anchovies and remove heads, fins and bones.  In a small
saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat with garlic and cook until
just light brown.  Add anchovies and capers and stir until broken up
into paste. Remove from heat and set aside.

Pour 3 inches of oil into a 6-inch tall frying pan and heat to 360
degrees F. While oil is heating, cut polenta into 2-inch rounds using
a grappa glass or cookie cutters, yielding about 40 pieces. Place 1/4
teaspoon anchovy mixture on one polenta disk and make a sandwich by
covering with a second polenta disk.  Dredge each sandwich in flour,
then in egg and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Continue
until all the sandwiches are finished and serve hot.
