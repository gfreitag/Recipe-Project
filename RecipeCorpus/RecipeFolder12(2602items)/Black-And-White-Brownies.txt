Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Butter and flour for baking
Pan
1 c  Plus 6 tablespoons (3
Ounces) cake flour, sifted
After measuring
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Instant coffee
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
Melted and cooled to room
Temperature
5 1/2 oz Unsalted butter
1 1/2 c  White chocolate, cut up
4 lg Eggs
1    Cup, plus 10 tablespoons
Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter and flour a 9 by
13-inch baking pan and set aside. Blend the flour with salt and
coffee and set aside.

In a double boiler, over medium heat, melt the chocolate. When
melted, add the butter and melt, over low heat and stir until smooth;
let cool to room temperature. While this is cooling, cut the white
chocolate into bit sized bits

With an electric mixer beat the eggs and sugar for about 5 minutes or
until light, thick and ribbony. When the chocolate has melted, fold
it into the eggs along with the vanilla. Gently with a rubber
spatula, fold the flour into the batter in a few smooth swift
strokes. Do not over mix or the brownies will be heavy. Fold in the
white chocolate chunks and transfer the batter into the prepared
baking pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the top springs back
when you press it lightly with your fingertips or when a toothpick
when inserted in center of dough comes out clean. Remove from the
oven and let set until completely cool. Cut into rectangles and wrap
individually in plastic wrap or foil to keep them very fresh.

Yield: 20 bar cookies
