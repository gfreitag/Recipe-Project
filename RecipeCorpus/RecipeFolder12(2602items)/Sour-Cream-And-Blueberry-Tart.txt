MMMMM--------------------COOKING LIVE #CL8969-------------------------
4    Eggs
pn Salt
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Sugar
1 pt Sour cream
2 pt Blueberries, picked over
MMMMM---------------------1-2-3 SWEET DOUGH--------------------------
3/4 c  Butter
3/8 c  Sugar
1    Eggs
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 pn Salt
2 c  Flour
1-2-3-SWEET DOUGH: Using the kitchen aid, cream the butter and sugar
until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until well
combined. Mix in the vanilla extract and be sure to scrape the bottom
of the bowl. Add the flour all at once and mix until all of the
ingredients are incorporated. Form a disk, wrap in plastic and
refrigerate for at least one hour before using.

Roll out the dough to an 11-inch ring. Place dough in a 10-inch tart
pan with a removable bottom. Press dough carefully into pan and trim
edges. Chill until firm. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line the
tart pan with parchment paper and fill with beans or pie weights.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden. Remove
weights and let cool.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a bowl whisk together the eggs,
salt, vanilla extract and sugar. Slowly stir in the sour cream, being
careful not to create any foaminess. Strain if necessary. Fill the
prepared tart shell with the berries. Pour the custard into the shell
and bake until custard is set, about 25 minutes.
