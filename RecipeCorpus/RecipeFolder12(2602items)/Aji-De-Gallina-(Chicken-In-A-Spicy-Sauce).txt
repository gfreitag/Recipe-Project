4    Pounds)
1    Leek, trimmed, washed and
Chopped
1 md Onion, peeled and chopped
1 md Carrot, peeled and chopped
1    Tomato, chopped
2 ts Coarse salt
1 tb Peppercorns
2    Bay leaves
2 c  Soft bread crumbs
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Olive oil
2    Onions, finely chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 ts Ground cumin
1 tb Yellow Aji, Amarillo or
Chile powder
1/3 c  Finely chopped or ground
Walnuts
1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
2 lb Small potatoes, boiled,
Peeled and halved
4    Hard-boiled eggs, halved
Chopped parsley for garnish
Place chicken in a large pot and fill with water to halfway up sides
of bird. Add leek, onion, carrot, tomato, salt, peppercorns and bay
leaves. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 45
minutes, or until chicken is done. Remove chicken and place in a bowl
until cool enough to remove the meat from the bones and shred into
bitesize pieces. Meanwhile, strain broth and reserve 4 cups.

Soak the bread in the milk. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium
heat. Add the onions and sautJ until soft and golden, about 10
minutes. Add the garlic and cumin and sautJ for 1 more minute. Add
softened bread and aji or chile powder, and cook for about 1 minute,
stirring. (For a creamier sauce, place onionbread mixture in a
blender, puree until smooth and return to skillet.) Add 2 cups of the
chicken stock and continue cooking until sauce thickens and coats the
back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.

Add the chicken and simmer for 5 to 8 more minutes, adding more stock
if needed. Stir in the walnuts and Parmesan cheese, and simmer gently
for another 5 minutes, or until thickened slightly. To serve, spoon
chicken and sauce onto a serving platter and surround with potatoes
and eggs. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
