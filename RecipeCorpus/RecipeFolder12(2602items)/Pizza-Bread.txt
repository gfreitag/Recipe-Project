Categories: Mario
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Warm water
5 1/2 oz Brewer's yeast
1 tb Honey
15 1/2 c  Allpurpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 tb Olive oil plus 1 tablespoon
Place wine, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved
Add honey, sat and olive oil and mix through.  Add 1 cup flour and
mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter.  Add 2 more
cups of flour and stir in as much as you can with the wooden spoon (2
to 3 minutes).

Bring dough together with your hands and turn out on to flour board or
marble surface.  Knead about 6 to 8 minutes until you have made a
smooth, firm dough.  Place in a clean, lightly oiled bowl and cover
with a towel. Let rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45
minutes.

For individual pizzas or calzones, cut the dough into four equal
pieces and knead into rounds.  For one large pizza, knead into one
large round. For both, let rest 15 minutes.
