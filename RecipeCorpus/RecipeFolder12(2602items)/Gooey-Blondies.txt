Title: Gooey Blondies
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3    Cups, plus 3 tablespoons
Flour, sifted after
Measuring
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Baking powder
8 oz Unsalted butter
2    Cups, plus 10 tablespoons,
Packed, dark brown sugar
3    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Peanut butter chips
1 c  Toasted pecans
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease and flour a 9 by
13-inch baking pan and set aside. Sift flour with salt, baking soda,
baking powder and set aside.

Melt butter in a large sauce pan over low heat. Add the brown sugar,
remove it from the heat and stir until completely blended; let cool
to room temperature. Add eggs one at a time stirring well after each
addition. Stir in the vanilla.

Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. With a rubber spatula,
fold the sifted flour into the batter with a few smooth swift strokes
and stir just until batter is blended and smooth. Do not over mix or
the blondies will be heavy. Stir in the chips and nuts and pour into
a prepared pan. With a spatula, spread the batter to make sure it is
even in thickness. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the top springs
back when you press it lightly with your fingertips or when a
toothpick, when inserted in the center of the dough comes out clean.

Remove the blondies from the oven and let them set until completely
cool. Cut into rectangles and wrap individually in plastic or foil to
keep them very fresh.

Yield: 20 blondies
