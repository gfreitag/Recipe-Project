Title: Road Trip Cookies
Categories: Baker, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
6 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
Into 1/4-inch pieces
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Tightly packed light brown
Sugar
1/4 lb Room temperature unsalted
Butter
2 lg Eggs
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
3 c  M&M's peanuts
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a sifter combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Sift onto a large
piece of waxed paper and set aside until needed.

Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
heat. With the heat on, place the semisweet chocolate in the top half
of the double boiler. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate until
completely melted and smooth, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a
1-quart bowl and set aside.

Place the granulated sugar, light brown sugar and butter in a 7-quart
bowl. Use a stiff rubber spatula (or a wooden spoon) to cream the
ingredients together until smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla extract
and mix to incorporate. Add the melted chocolate and mix until
combined. Add the sifted dry ingredients and thoroughly combine. Add
the M&M=s, mixing to incorporate.

Using 3 heaping tablespoons of dough for each cookie (approximately 3
ounces), portion 6 cookies, evenly spaced, onto each of 3 nonstick
baking sheets (this is a hefty cookie, so don't crowd). Place the
baking sheets on the top and center racks of the preheated oven and
bake for 14 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and cool to
room temperature on the baking sheets, about 30 minutes. Store the
cooled cookies in a tightly sealed plastic container until ready to
serve.
