1 c  Whole almonds, about 5
Ounces
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Bleached all purpose flour
10 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Dark rum
2 ts Vanilla extract
8 lg Egg whites
1 pn Salt
1/4 c  Sliced, blanched almonds,
About 1 ounce
Confectioners sugar for
Finishing
Butter and line with parchment a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan. Set
rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Place the almonds and 3/4 cup of the sugar in a food processor and
pulse until the mixture is finely ground. Transfer to a bowl and stir
in the flour. Melt the butter, allow it to cook until it colors; cool
slightly and add the rum and vanilla extract. Set aside to cool
slightly.

In a clean dry bowl, whip the egg whites with the salt until they
form a very soft peak. Add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar in a very slow
stream, whipping constantly. Continue whipping the egg whites until
they hold a soft peak. Alternately fold the almond and butter
mixtures into the egg whites, 1/3 at a time. Begin with the almond
mixture and end with the butter. Pour the batter into the prepared
pan. Smooth the top and sprinkle with the sliced almonds. Bake the
Financier for about 50 minutes until well risen and golden The center
of the cake should feel firm when pressed with the palm of the hand.
Cool the financier briefly on a rack and remove pan and paper. If
some of the almonds on the surface fall off, replace them on the
cake. Dust very lightly with confectioners' sugar.

Yield: one 10-inch cake
