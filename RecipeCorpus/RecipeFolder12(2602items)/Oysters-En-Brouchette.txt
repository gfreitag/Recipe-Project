12 sl Bacon, cut in half and at
Room temperature
1 c  All-purpose four
Vegetable oil for frying
Preheat the oil. With paper towels, pat the oysters dry. Season the
oysters with Essence and salt and pepper. Wrap each oyster with a
piece of bacon. Using a toothpick, secure the bacon and oyster
together. In a mixing bowl, season the flour with Essence. Toss the
oysters, a couple at a time, in the seasoned flour, coating each side
completely. Shake off the excess flour and gently place half of the
oysters in the hot oil. Fry the oysters until golden brown, about 3
to 4 minutes. Remove the oysters from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season the hot oysters with Essence. Repeat the
process until all of the oysters are fried. Serve the oysters hot
with the Remoulade Sauce.
