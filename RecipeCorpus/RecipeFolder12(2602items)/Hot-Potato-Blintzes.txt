Add the potatoes and carrots to a large pot of boiling water and cook

Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan, add the onions and cook until

cook 3 minutes longer.

Mix the sauteed ingredients with the potatoes and carrots. Add the
butter and sour cream. Blend well until the hot potato mixture is
creamy but firm. Use milk, half-and-half, or mocha mix to reach a
thick and creamy consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
For spicier potatoes add serrano chiles.
