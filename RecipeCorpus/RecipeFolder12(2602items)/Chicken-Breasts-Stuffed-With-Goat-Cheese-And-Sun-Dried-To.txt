Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Minced onion
2 tb Olive oil
2 ts Minced garlic
1/4 c  Finely chopped toasted
Walnuts
1/2 c  Chopped drained sun dried
Tomatoes
1 c  Crumbled goat cheese
2 ts Minced fresh thyme
2 ts Fresh basil, chiffonade
2    Whole boneless chicken
Breasts with skin, halved
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a skillet, cook the onion in 1 tablespoon of oil over moderate
heat, until softened. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute.
Transfer mixture to a bowl and let cool. Stir in walnuts, tomatoes,
goat cheese, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste, stirring until
combined.

With your fingers make a pocket for the filling in each chicken
breast half by separating the skin from the meat, being careful not
to tear the skin and keeping the skin attached along most of the
edge. Stuff each pocket with one fourth of the filling with a small
spoon, packing it and pulling the skin to cover the filling
completely.

In the cleaned skillet heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over
moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown chicken,
skin sides down. Leaving chicken skins down, transfer skillet to oven
and bake until just cooked through, about 12 minutes.
