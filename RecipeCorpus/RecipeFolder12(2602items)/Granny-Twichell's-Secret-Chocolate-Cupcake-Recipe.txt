Title: Granny Twichell's Secret Chocolate Cupcake Recipe
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
10 oz Semisweet chocolate, broken
Into 1/2-ounce pieces
1 c  Heavy cream
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
Broken into 1/2-ounce
Pieces
5 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
3/4 c  Cake flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.

Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
heat. Place 10 ounces semisweet chocolate, 1 cup heavy cream and 2
ounces unsweetened chocolate in the top half of the double boiler.
Tightly cover with plastic wrap. Allow to heat for 8 minutes. Remove
from the heat and stir until smooth. Set aside until needed.

Place the eggs, sugar and vanilla extract in the bowl of an electric
mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium until lemon-colored and
slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Add the melted chocolate mixture
and beat on medium for 15 to 20 seconds more. Add the cake flour,
baking soda and chocolate chips, and beat on low for 10 seconds.
Increase to medium and beat for an additional 10 seconds. Remove the
bowl from the mixer. Use a rubber spatula and thoroughly combine the
batter.

Evenly divide the mixture into 18 bake cups that have already been
positioned into muffin tins, filling the cups to within 1/4 below the
rim. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven
and allow to cool to room temperature.
