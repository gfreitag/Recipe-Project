Title: Angel Food Cake
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
1 c  Sifted cake flour
11 oz Egg whites (approximately 11
Eggs)
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cream of tartar
There are two essentials for a successful angel food cake: absolutely
grease free preparation and properly beaten whites. Thoroughly wash
with hot water and soap a 10-inch tube pan and all equipment and
utensils that you will need. Rinse with clean water and leave
utensils wet.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. If using a convection oven preheat to
300 degrees F.

Into a bowl sift together 1 1/2 cups of the confectioners' sugar and
the cake flour. Set aside.

In a glass or metal bowl (don't use plastic) combine egg whites, salt
and cream of tartar. Begin beating at medium speed until whites are
foamy and gradually add remaining 1 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar.
Continue beating just until soft peaks form. Time will vary according
to several factors: age and temperature of whites, temperature of
your kitchen, and power of your mixer.

Gently fold the flour mixture into the beaten whites.

Immediately pour batter into tube pan and bake in center of oven for
35 to 45 minutes, depending on the type of oven, or until a cake
tester inserted in center comes out clean.

Remove cake from oven and immediately invert pan. Let cool completely
in pan. Do not refrigerate.

To remove cake from pan gently loosen edges with fingers or a thin
knife. Invert cake onto cardboard circle or serving plate and push
out on bottom of pan. You can pull on the center tube for help. With
your hands or a thin knife, gently ease the cake off of the center
tube.
