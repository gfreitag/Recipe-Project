Title: Classic Bistro Potato Gratin Dauphinoise
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Unsalted butter
3    Cloves garlic, chopped,
About 3 tablespoons
1 c  Heavy cream
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground white pepper
4 lg Russet potatoes, about 2
Pounds
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Butter a 2 quart flame proof casserole or gratin dish.  Peel the
potatoes and hold them in cold water until ready to proceed with the
recipe. Combine the garlic, cream, salt and pepper in a small bowl.
Dry the potatoes fully and cut them into rounds, beginning at one
end, using a mandoline. Set the blade on the mandoline to cut a thin,
1/8-inch thick, slice. Place the potato slices into the gratin dish
carefully layering them in a circular fashion.  Pour the seasoned
cream over the potatoes and shake the dish gently to allow the cream
to flow towards the bottom of the dish.

Place the gratin dish on the stovetop over low heat and begin to warm
the contents until the cream has begun to simmer.  Cook the potatoes
in the seasoned cream for 5 minutes and then place the gratin dish
into the oven.

Bake the potatoes for 45 to 60 minutes until the top has browned to a
rich golden color and the cream is bubbling along the side of the
dish.

Remove the gratin from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes
before serving.

Yield: 6 to 8 portions
