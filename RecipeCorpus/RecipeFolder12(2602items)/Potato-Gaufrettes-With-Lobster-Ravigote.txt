Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Idaho potato, peeled
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1    Egg
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
1/4 c  Chopped celery
2 tb Chopped garlic
2 tb Prepared horseradish
1/4 c  Creole or whole grain
Mustard
3 tb Ketchup
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
Leaves
Juice of one fresh lemon
3/4 c  Olive oil
1 lb Cook lobster meat, small
Diced
4 c  Assorted baby greens
Drizzle of extra virgin
Olive oil
4 oz Crumbled Goat's cheese
Preheat the fryer. Using a mandoline with a cris-cross blade, cut the
potatoes, lengthwise, into thin waffle-like chips. Fry the potatoes in
batches until golden brown, about, 3 minutes, stirring occasionally
for overall browning. Remove and drain on paper towels. Season with
salt and pepper. Using a food processor, fitted with a metal blade,
combine the egg, onions, green onions, celery, garlic, horseradish,
mustard, ketchup, parsley and lemon juice. Puree until smooth. Season
with salt and pepper. With the machine running and in a steady stream
add the oil. Process until all of the oil is incorporated and the
mixture is thick. Season with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl, toss
the lobster with 1/2 of the Remoulade, reserving the other half for a
later use. Season with salt and pepper. In another mixing bowl, toss
the greens with the extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. To
assemble, mound the greens in the center of each plate. Arrange the
potatoes around the greens and place a spoonful of the Lobster
Remoulade on top of each potato. Garnish with the crumbled Goat's
cheese.
