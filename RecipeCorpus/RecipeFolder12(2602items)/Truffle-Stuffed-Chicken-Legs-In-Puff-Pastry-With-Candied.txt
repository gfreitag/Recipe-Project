Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Butternut squash
2 tb Butter
2 ts Sugar
Cinnamon, a pinch
Nutmeg, a pinch
Salt and pepper
4    Boned chicken legs with
Thighs attached, leaving
Bottom joint of

Olive oil, for drizzling
2 ea Fresh lemons, pith and skin
Cut into 1/4-inch slices
8    Cloves of garlic
1/2 c  Onions, julienned
1    Black truffle, shaved into
Thin slices
1    Recipe of basic pie dough,
Rolled out into 2 (9-inch)
Dough rounds, cut
In 1/2
1    Egg, beaten
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bring a pot of boiling water to a
boil. Add the squash and season with 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook until
the squash is tender, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and
drain. In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter. Add
the squash, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper.
Saute for 2 minutes and remove from the heat. Keep the squash warm.
Season the chicken legs all over with a drizzle of olive oil and salt
and pepper. In a small mixing bowl, toss the lemon zest, garlic and
onions with olive oil, salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity of each
chicken leg with the lemon and onion mixture. Divide the truffle
slices into 1/4 and stuff the truffle slices underneath the skin of
each chicken leg. Brush the 1/2-circles of dough with some of the
beaten egg and place one leg on each piece with the joint sticking
out. Fold the ends over to create a wrapper and place, seam side
down, on a parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the outside of each
package with more of the beaten egg and bake until the crust is brown
and the chicken tender, about 35 minutes. Serve the candied squash
with the chicken legs.
