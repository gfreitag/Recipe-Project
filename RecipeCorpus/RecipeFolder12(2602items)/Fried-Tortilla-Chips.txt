Title: Fried Tortilla Chips
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Vegetable oil for deep
Frying
12 lg Corn tortillas (recipe
Below), or use storebought,
Cut into 6
Wedges each
1/2 ts Salt
Pour the oil into a large pot, to a depth of 2 to 3 inches, and heat
to 375 degrees. Test by dropping in a piece of tortilla. If it
bubbles immediately and rises to the surface, the oil is ready.

Fry the wedges a handful at a time, stirring to separate, until very
lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a strainer or slotted
spoon, shaking off excess oil, and transfer to paper towels to drain.
Sprinkle with salt while still warm, and continue frying in batches.
