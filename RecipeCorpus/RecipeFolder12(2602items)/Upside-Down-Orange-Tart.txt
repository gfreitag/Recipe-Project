Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
15 1/2 c  Flour and extra for dusting
Pan
3    Eggs
5 1/2 c  Sugar plus 2 cups
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1 c  Milk
1 tb Active dry yeast
Zest and juice of 6 large
Oranges
Segments of 4 oranges
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Oil and dust with flour an 8inch cake pan.

In a mixer, beat eggs and 11/2 cups sugar until light yellow, about 6
to 7 minutes. Add oil and milk and blend well. Add yeast and mix 20
seconds. Add flour, 1 cup at a time until all is incorporated. Pour
into prepared cake pan and place in oven. Cook until golden brown and
a toothpick exits dry from the center of the cake, about 35 to 45
minutes.

Meanwhile, place remaining 2 cups of sugar, zest and orange juice

remaining cup behind.

Unmold cake and paint with 1 cup reduced juice all over. Arrange
segments over tart in concentric circles. Spoon remaining syrup and
zest over cake, cut into wedges and serve.
