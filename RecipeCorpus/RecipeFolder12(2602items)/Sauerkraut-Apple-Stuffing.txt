Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Chopped onion
1 c  Chopped celery
1/2    Stick unsalted butter
3 tb Firmly packed light brown
Sugar
1 lg Garlic clove, minced
2    Granny Smith apples, peeled,
Cored, and chopped (about 2
Cups)
1 1/2 lb Sauerkraut, rinsed and
Drained well
1/2 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
In a large skillet cook the onion and the celery in the butter over
moderately low heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened,
stir in the brown sugar, the garlic, and the apples, and cook the
mixture, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Add the sauerkraut,
the thyme and salt to taste, stir the stuffing until it is combined

flavors. Bring the stuffing to room temperature before stuffing the
turkey.

The stuffing can also be baked separately. Spoon the stuffing into a
shallow baking dish and bake it, covered, in a preheated 325 degree
oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Yield: 8 cups uncooked stuffing, or enough for a 14 pound turkey
