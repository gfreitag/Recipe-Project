Prepare grill.

coat well. Grill peppers and onions on an oiled rack set 5 to 6
inches over glowing coals 3 minutes on each side, or until tender.
(Alternatively, peppers and onions may be grilled in batches in a hot
well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat.)

Transfer peppers and onions to a bowl.

Grill bratwurst, turning them, until golden and just cooked through
(about 160 degrees on an instant-read thermometer), 20 minutes.

Put a pair of brats, cut in half lengthwise and stacked on each roll.
Top with peppers, onions, pickles and mustard.
