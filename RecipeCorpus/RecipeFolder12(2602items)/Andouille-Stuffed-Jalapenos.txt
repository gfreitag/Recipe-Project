Title: Andouille Stuffed Jalapenos
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Olive oil
2 oz Bulk andouille, finely
Chopped
2 tb Finely chopped onions
1 ts Minced garlic
1 tb Chopped parsley
1/2 c  Cream cheese
Salt and pepper
16 lg Fresh jalapenos
Essence
3 c  Flour
2    Egg yolks
3/4    To 1 cup beer
pn Baking powder
Salt and pepper
Oil for frying
Preheat the fryer. In a saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat and
render the andouille for 2 minutes. Add the onions and saute for 1
minute. Remove from the heat and cool. In a mixing bowl, mix the
garlic, parsley, and cream cheese together. Mix well. Stir in the
cooled andouille mixture. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and
pepper. Using a sharp knife, split the jalapenos, starting at the
tip, in half, leaving the stem intact. Remove the seeds from the
pepper. Stuff 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling in the center of
each pepper. Press the pepper together, sealing the cheese mixture
completely inside. Season 1 cup of flour with Essence. In a mixing
bowl, whisk the yolks and 3/4 cup of the beer. Season the mixture
with salt and pepper. Whisk in enough flour to form a batter. If the
batter is too thick add the remaining beer to thin the batter. Dredge
the stuffed peppers in the seasoned flour. Dip the jalapenos in the
batter, letting the excess drip off and coating the peppers
completely. Gently lay the jalapenos in the hot oil and fry until
golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the jalapenos from the oil
and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the peppers with Essence.
