Title: Touch-Of-Grace Biscuits
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1 1/2 c  Southern self-rising flour
1/8 ts Baking soda
1/3 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
3 tb Shortening
1    To 1 1/4 cups buttermilk or
3/4 c  Buttermilk and 1/2 cup heavy
Cream
Or whipping cream
1 c  Bleached all-purpose flour
For shaping
2 tb Butter, melted
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (246 degrees C) and spray an 8-inch
round cake pan with non-stick cooking spray. Combine the self-rising
flour, soda, salt, and sugar in a medium mixing bowl. With your
fingers or a pastry cutter, work the shortening into the flour
mixture until there are no shortening lumps larger than a big pea.
Stir in the buttermilk and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the cup
of all-purpose flour onto a plate or pie tin. Flour your hands well.
Spoon a biscuit-sized lump of wet dough into the flour and sprinkle
some flour over the wet dough to coat the outside. Pick the biscuit
up and shape into a soft round. At the same time, shake off the
excess flour. As you shape each biscuit place into the pan. Push the
biscuits tightly against one another so that they will rise up and
not out. Continue shaping until all of the dough is used. To make a
large batch of biscuits in a hurry, spray a medium-small (about
2-inch) ice cream scoop with non-stick cooking spray. Cover a
jelly-roll pan with all purpose flour. Quickly scoop biscuits onto
the flour, sprinkle with flour, shape and place in small pans. Brush
the biscuits with melted butter and bake until lightly browned (15 to
20 minutes). Cool for 1 to 2 minutes in the pan, then dump out and
cut the biscuits apart. Split the biscuits in half, butter or spread
with Cherry Chambord Butter.
