Title: Havana Bananas
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4    Ripe bananas
2 1/2 tb Butter
2 tb The prepared chile jelly
3 tb Myers dark rum
4    Scoops of premium vanilla
(or other favorite) ice
Cream
Your favorite chocolate
Sauce, as desired
For the chile jelly:
2    Ancho chilies, stems and
Seeds discarded
2    Chipotle chilies, stems and
Seeds discarded
6 tb Red currant jelly
6 tb Honey
2 tb Spanish sherry wine vinegar
Toast the chilies in a dry skillet until they are very warm and
fragrant.

Put them in a saucepan with 1 quart of water and simmer on medium heat
until the water is almost completely evaporated. Add the currant
jelly, honey and vinegar. Bring to a boil. Now remove from the heat
and process in a food processor thoroughly. Remove to a clean bowl
and cool.

Note: This will make more Chile Jelly than needed for this one recipe
but it can be made weeks in advance and held in the refrigerator.
Also it is a good glaze for finishing a grilled chicken or baked ham.

Peel the bananas and cut them into 1/4-inch thick slices. Heat a
skillet to moderately hot. Place the bananas in the skillet with the
butter and brown sugar. When the butter is melted add the chile
jelly. Toss the bananas around to coat them. Now add the rum to pan
and carefully deglaze.

Place a scoop of ice cream onto the center of 4 bowls. Arrange the
bananas around the ice cream. Drizzle with the chocolate sauce. Serve.
