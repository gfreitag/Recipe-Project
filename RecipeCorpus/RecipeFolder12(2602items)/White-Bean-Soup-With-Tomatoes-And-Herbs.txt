Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 bn Fresh thyme or 1 tablespoon
Dried
lg Sprig of fresh rosemary or 1
1/2 ts Dried
2 bn Fresh oregano or 1
Tablespoon plus
1 1/2 teaspoons dried
3 c  Dried white beans, washed
12 c  Water
1/4 c  Olive oil or 4 tablespoons
Unsalted butter
1 md Onion, diced
6    Garlic cloves, minced
2 c  Canned tomatoes, chopped,
With their liquid
2 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 qt Vegetable stock or water
2    To 2 1/2 limes, quartered
If using fresh herbs, make an herb packet by placing a large square of
cheesecloth on a counter. Place the thyme, rosemary and half the
oregano in the center, gather the ends together and tie to enclose.
Remove the leaves from the remaining bunch of oregano, chop and
reserve.

Combine the beans, fresh herb packet or the dried herbs and water in a
large saucepan or stockpot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and
cook, covered, until the beans are cooked through but still firm, 1
hour. Remove from the heat. Lift out and discard the herb bundle.

In a large stockpot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat.
Saute the onions until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.

Stir in the garlic and cook just until the aroma is released, about 5
minutes. Add the tomatoes and their liquid, salt, pepper and half of
the reserved chopped oregano (if using fresh). Reduce the heat to
mediumlow and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid is
evaporated. Stir in the beans and their cooking liquid and cook 5
minutes longer.

Pour in the vegetable stock or water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a
simmer and cook about 40 minutes, or until the beans are very tender.

Serve hot, garnished with the remaining chopped fresh oregano and lime
wedges.
