Categories: Emeril, Veggies
Yield: 4 servings
1    Smoked ham hock
6 oz Thick slab bacon, chopped
(about 5 slices)
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1 tb Chopped garlic
1    12-ounce bottle beer
Tabasco
Salt and freshly-ground
Black pepper
Crushed red pepper
16 c  Loosely-packed washed greens
(such as kale, collard,
Mustard and
Beet)
In a large heavy pot sweat ham hock and bacon in oil over medium-low
heat until bacon begins to render some fat.  Add onions and garlic
and saute until onion is tender, about 5 minutes.  Stir in beer and
season with Tabasco, salt, pepper and crushed red pepper.  Bring to a
boil and stir in greens, a large handful at a time.  When all greens
are added, reduce heat to simmering, cover and cook until greens are
very tender, about 15 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasoning before
serving.
