Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    Chicken carcass (or 2
Pheasant or 8 quail
Carcasses)
2 tb Corn, peanut, or vegetable
Oil
1 c  Coarsely chopped onion
3/4 c  Coarsely chopped carrots
3/4 c  Coarsely chopped celery
3    Sprigs fresh thyme
3    Sprigs fresh parsley
1 sm Bay leaf
1 tb White peppercorns
5 c  Water to cover
DEMI-GLACE:
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch mixed with 1 1/2
TB cold water
Have butcher cut carcass into small pieces or use a cleaver to do so
at home. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Add carcass. Cook, stirring often, until well browned.

Add remaining oil with onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring
frequently, until vegetables are golden brown. Pour off oil. Add
thyme, parsley, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Stir to blend and add
water to cover. Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer about 1 1/2 to
2 hours, skimming surface as necessary, until reduced to 4 cups. Line
a bowl with an extra fine sieve (preferably a chinois).

Pour mixture into the sieve and strain, pushing solids with a wooden
spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids. Skim off
any surface fat. Refrigerate, tightly sealed, for no more than 2
days, or freeze in small quantities for ease of use for up to 3
months.

To make demi-glace: Bring finished stock to a boil over high heat.
Stir in cornstarch and water mixture, whisking constantly. Lower heat
and simmer until reduced to 2 cups or thick enough to coat the back
of a spoon. Stir occasionally as demi-glace cools to keep it from
separating.

Demi-glace will keep up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for 2 to 3
months in the freezer, tightly sealed. For ease of use, store
demi-glace in small quantities.

Yield: 4 cups stock or 2 cups demi-glace
