Title: Turtle Creek Pie
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3    Extra large eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Dark corn syrup
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
4    Granny Smith apples, peeled,
Cored, and sliced thin
1    9-inch frozen pastry shell,
Unbaked
1/2 c  Pecan pieces
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine eggs and sugar, mixing until sugar is dissolved. Stir in corn
syrup, butter, and vanilla. Strain through a fine sieve and set aside.

Place a layer of apple slices in one direction on the bottom of the
shell to form a circle around the outside edge of the shell. Place a
second layer inside the first in the opposite direction to form a
concentric circle.

Slowly and carefully so as not to disturb slices, pour filling over
apples. Sprinkle pecans around outer edge of apples.

Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour. Shield edge with a ring
of foil if it begins to get too brown. Return pie to oven and bake
for an additional 20 to 25 minutes or until the filling is set. Let
cool slightly before cutting.

Yield: 1 10-inch pie
