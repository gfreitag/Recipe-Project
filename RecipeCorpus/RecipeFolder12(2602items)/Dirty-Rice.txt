Title: Dirty Rice
Categories: Emeril, Sides
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb Flour
1 lb Lean ground pork
1/2 lb Chicken livers, cleaned and
Coarsely chopped
1 c  Chopped onion
1/2 c  Chopped green bell pepper
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/2 lb Chicken gizzards, cleaned
1 tb Creole seasoning
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
1/2 c  Finely-chopped green onions
4 c  Cooked rice
In a small heavy saucepan heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium
heat and whisk in flour.  Cook, whisking constantly, until roux
thickens and darkens to a mahogany color; do not let burn.  When
well-colored, remove from heat.  In a large heavy skillet heat
remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat and brown ground
pork, stirring and breaking up pieces. Add chicken livers, onions,
bell pepper and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until
vegetables are tender.

Meanwhile, in a large pot bring gizzards and enough cold water to
cover (about 3 cups), to a boil over high heat.  Boil until tender,
about 30 minutes; drain, reserving stock and gizzards separately.
Grind gizzards in food processor and add to pork and vegetable
mixture, with roux, reserved stock and Creole seasoning; season to
taste with salt and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil, cover and reduce
heat to simmering. Cook about 30 minutes, until flavors are
well-blended.

Before serving, add parsley, green onions and rice, mixing gently but
thoroughly to combine.  Adjust seasoning to taste with salt and
pepper and serve immediately.
