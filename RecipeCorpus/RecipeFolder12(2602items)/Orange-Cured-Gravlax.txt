Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Salmon fillet, skin on, all
Bones removed
1/4 c  Roughly chopped fresh dill
1/4 c  Roughly chopped fresh
Tarragon
1 ts Rinsed and crushed green
Peppercorns
1/4 c  Kosher salt
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb Grand Marnier
8    Lemon wedges
8    Sprigs dill
Rinse the salmon, pat dry, and cut crosswise in half. Lay 1 piece
skin-side down on the work surface. sprinkle with half the herbs and
peppercorns, all of the salt and sugar, the Grand Marnier, then the
remaining herbs and peppercorns.

Place the second piece of salmon on top, skin side-up, like a
sandwich. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, place in a dish, and
refrigerate for 48 hours, turning every 8 hours. (If a lot of liquid
accumulates in the dish, unwrap the salmon, baste with the liquid,
and re-wrap.)

Remove the marinated salmon from the plastic and scrape away the
herbs and seasonings. Blot the salmon dry, then cut into paper-thin
slices. Arrange on chilled plates with a lemon wedge and dill sprig
and serve with toast points, Potato Crisps and Creme Fraiche.
