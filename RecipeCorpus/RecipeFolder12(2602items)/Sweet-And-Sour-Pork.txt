To make marinade:

In a bowl combine the first 6 ingredients and whisk them together.

Cut the pork into 1-inch cubes, and with the flat side of a cleaver
or a meat pounder, lightly pound the cubes to loosen fibers.  Add
meat to marinade and toss to coat.  Let the meat marinate, covered
and chilled, for 1 hour.

To make the sauce:

In a bowl combine the sugar, salt, rice wine vinegar, tomato sauce,
light soy sauce, and Shaosing wine.  To a heated wok add the
vegetable oil, minced garlic, and minced ginger.

Stir fry 30 seconds.  Add sauce ingredients from bowl and bring to a
simmer.  Stir in 1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2/3 cup canned
chicken broth.  Simmer mixture until lightly thickened, then keep it
warm.

To make the stir-fry:

In 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, stir fry the sliced onions, sliced
green peppers, and sliced red peppers.  Cook them for 2 minutes, or
until softened. In another wok put a quart of peanut oil and heat it
to 365 degrees.  In a shallow bowl mix together 1/3 cup each
cornstarch and flour. Dredge meat pieces in flour mixture.  Add meat
to wok.  Deep fry pork until crunchy brown, about three minutes.
Transfer meat with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. To the
wok with the stirfried vegetables add the pineapple dice, the pickled
shallots, and the sauce. Simmer for one minute, then add the meat.
Simmer until heated through. Add 1 tablespoon sesame oil and serve
immediately.
