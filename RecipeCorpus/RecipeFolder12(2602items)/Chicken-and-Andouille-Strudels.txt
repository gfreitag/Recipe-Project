Title: Chicken and Andouille Strudels
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
4 oz Andouille sausage, cut into
1/4    -inch dice
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1 tb Chopped garlic
Salt and cayenne
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Sweet BBQ sauce
1 tb Chopped parsley
3 tb Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
4    Sheets phyllo dough
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a saute pan, over medium heat,
add the oil. Season the chicken with Essence. When the oil is hot,
add the chicken and saute for about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring
constantly. Add the andouille and saute for 2 minutes. Add the onions
and garlic and saute for 5 minutes. Season with salt and cayenne. Add
the water, 1/2 cup BBQ sauce, parsley and cheese and simmer for 1
minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the bread crumbs. Cool the
mixture completely. Stack the four sheets of phyllo

dough one top of each other and cut all into thirds. You will have a
total of 12 sheets. Divide the sheets into four 3-sheet stacks. Keep
the phyllo covered with a damp towel to prevent the phyllo from
drying out. Lightly brush the top of each stack with vegetable oil.
Put 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture on the bottom edge of each stack
of phyllo. Fold two sides of the phyllo toward the center about
1/4-inch. Then, beginning at the bottom, roll up the phyllo securely,
pressing each to close. Lightly brush each strudel with oil. Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the strudels on the paper,
about 2 inches apart and bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and cut each strudel in half at a diagonal and
serve each with the remaining BBQ sauce and grated cheese.
