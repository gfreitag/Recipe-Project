1 1/4 lb Crayfish, rinsed

1.  To cook chicken, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Rinse chicken, par
dry, then season with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet
over medium heat.  Add chicken, skin side down, and brown, about 8
minutes per side. Transfer chicken to oven and cook until juices run
clear, about 20 minutes ore.  Transfer to a large platter and cover
with aluminum foil.

2.  To make sauce, heat oil in another large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add crayfish and cook, stirring, for five minutes. Remove pan
from heat, add cognac, and, using a long handled match, ignite.
Return pan to heat and cook until flames die.

3.  Remove one-third of crayfish; set aside.  Reduce heat to medium,
add onions, shallots, and carrots, and cook until soft, 20 minutes.
Add tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme, tarragon, bay leaves, and wine.
Cook for ten minutes, add cream, and simmer, stirring occasionally,
until sauce thickens, about thirty minutes.  Season sauce with salt
and pepper, strain through a fine sieve, then spoon over chicken.
Serve garnished with crayfish (and fresh parsley if desired).
