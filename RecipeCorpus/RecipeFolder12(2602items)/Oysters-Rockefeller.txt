Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2    Dozen large oysters, shucked
With all their liquor and
The deeper halves
Their shells reserved and
Scrubbed
1    Bottle of clam broth
2    Sticks butter, cubed
1 c  Flour
1 c  Minced onions
3 tb Anchovy paste
1 tb Chopped garlic
1 1/2 lb Fresh watercress, washed,
Patted dry, trimmed, and
Finely
Chopped
1 1/2 lb Fresh spinach, washed,
Patted dry, trimmed and
Finely
Chopped
1/2 c  Herbsaint
Rock salt
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Drain the oysters and liquid
through a fine mesh strainer.  You should have 3 cups of oyster
liquor, if not add enough clam broth to make up for the difference.
In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Stir in the
flour and cook for 4 minutes. Stir in the onions and cook for 2
minutes. Stir in the anchovy paste, garlic, watercress, and spinach.
Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the oyster
liquor and bring the liquid up to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and
continue to cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until the sauce is thick.
Remove from the heat and stir in the Herbsaint. Reseason with salt
and pepper if needed.  Spread the rock salt evenly over a large sheet
pan.  Arrange the oyster shells on the baking sheet. Place the
oysters back in their shells.  Season the oysters with salt and
pepper. Place a heaping spoonful of the filling on top of each
oyster. Using the back of the spoon, gingerly pat the filling into
the shell. Sprinkle the top of the oyster with the grated cheese.
Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook for about 15 minutes or
until the sauce is golden brown and the oysters have curled. Remove
from the oven and serve on a large platter. Serve the oysters with
fish forks and fresh lemons.

Yields: 2 dozen oysters
