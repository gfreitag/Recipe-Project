Resift the cake flour with cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt
and cocoa.

Cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and
fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix until incorporated. Combine
the vinegar, buttermilk and red food coloring.

Alternately add buttermilk and flour mixture to the creamed butter,
stirring well after each addition. Transfer the batter to the
prepared cake pans and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a
toothpick, when inserted in the middle, comes out dry. Remove the
cakes from the oven and cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Remove from
the pans and transfer to a cake rack to cool. When thoroughly cool,
brush off the crumbs and ice with a boiled icing of your choice and
dust with coconut if you wish.
