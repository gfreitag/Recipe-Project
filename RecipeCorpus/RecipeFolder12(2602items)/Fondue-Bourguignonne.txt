oil, and season with salt and pepper. Combine pork with garlic,
shallots, egg yolk and mustard and form into tiny meat balls.
Decoratively arrange meats, meatballs and potatoes on a large
platter, or on 4 individual plates. Arrange sauces in individual
dipping bowls or plates. Place fondue pot of oil in center of table
over a small candle or sterno, and adjust flame so that it bubbles
but does not sputter when meat is added. Spear meat, meatball or
potato on long forks, place in pot and cook 20 to 30 seconds until
crispy. Remove meat from fork before eating -- fork will be burning
hot. You can use wooden skewers instead of long forks for cooking, if
you wish.
