Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Confectioners sugar
1/2 ts Salt
10 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
Into bits
1 lg Egg, separated
1/4 c  Ice water
6 tb Unsalted butter
1 c  Firmly packed dark brown
Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3 lg Eggs
3/4 c  Light corn syrup
1 tb Vanilla extract
1 c  Finely ground pecans
1 c  Chopped pecans
Make the crust: In a bowl combine the flour, sugar, salt and butter
and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl
combine the egg white and ice water. Add liquid to dry ingredients
and toss to combine. Form dough into ball and chill 1 hour.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough into a round 1/8-inch
thick and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate, crimping the edge. Chill 1
hour more.

Preheat oven to 400 F. Prick bottom and sides of shell, fit it with a
round of wax paper and weight it with rice or beans. Bake shell for
15 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. In a
small bowl whisk together egg yolk with 1/4 teaspoon water and brush
bottom and sides of shell with mixture. Return shell to oven and bake
for 2 minutes more.

Preheat oven to 275 F. In a bowl set over simmering water melt butter.
Remove bowl from heat and whisk in sugar, salt, eggs, one at a time,
corn syrup and vanilla. Return bowl to heat and stir until mixture is
shiny and warm to the touch. Add finely ground pecans and chopped
pecans. Bake in the oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until center feels
set, but still slightly soft. Cool at least 4 hours.
