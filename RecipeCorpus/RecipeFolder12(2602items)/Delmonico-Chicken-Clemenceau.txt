Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the chicken with olive oil,

minutes. In a large saute pan, melt the butter. Add the ham and saute
for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Saute for 1 minute. Add the garlic and
mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 2 minutes. Add the
peas and potatoes. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. In a saucepan, combine
the vinegar, wine, peppercorns, shallots, and tarragon. Bring the
liquid to a boil and reduce to 1 tablespoon. Add 1 tablespoon of
water. Add the egg yolks and whisk, over low heat, until frothy,
about 3 to 4 minutes. In a steady stream, add the butter until the
sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Strain the sauce through
a chinois and set aside. Remove the chicken from the oven and carve
into 4 pieces (2 breast and 2 leg/thigh). To serve, spoon the potato
mixture on the bottom of each plate. Lay the individual chicken
portions on top of the potatoes. Spoon the Bernaise Sauce over the
chicken and serve.
