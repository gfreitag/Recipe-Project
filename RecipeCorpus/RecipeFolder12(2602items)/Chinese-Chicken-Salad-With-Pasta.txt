Boil the pasta until al dente, about 10 minutes.

While the water is coming to a boil for the pasta and the pasta
itself is cooking, cut the chicken into strips about 2 inches long
and 1/4-inch wide. In the bottom of a mixing bowl combine the
scallions, sesame oil, rice vinegar, chili paste and peanut butter.
Whisk until smooth and season with salt and crushed red pepper.  Add
more of any ingredient to make it taste as you wish.

Add the chicken.  When the pasta is done, drain and rinse it under
cold water to stop the cooking process and pat dry.  Add the pasta to
the bowl, toss the ingredients together and adjust the seasoning.

Transfer the salad to a platter lined with spinach leaves (dressed or
not as you wish with a vinaigrette or favorite salad dressing).
Garnish with cucumbers, peanuts or cilantro.
