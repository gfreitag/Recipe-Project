Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6    Extra large egg yolks
1 1/4 c  Sugar
3 c  Heavy cream
1    Vanilla bean, split
1 c  Raspberries
6    Puff Pastry shells
(available in most frozen
Food departments)
Raspberry Coulis , recipe
Follows
Combine egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in the top 1/2 of the double
boiler over very hot water. Whisk (or beat with a hand mixer) until
lemon-colored and the consistency of mousse. Remove from heat and set
aside.

Place cream and vanilla bean in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.
Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Strain through a
fine sieve. Slowly pour into egg yolks, whisking rapidly as you pour.

Return double boiler to heat and cook, stirring constantly, for about
10 minutes or until mixture is quite thick. Remove top 1/2 of double
boiler and place in a bowl of ice. Stir occasionally while mixture
cools until it reaches the consistency of a very thick custard.

Spread a single layer of fresh raspberries over the bottom of six
baked Puff Pastry shells. Pour cooled creme over raspberries to top
of shells. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours (or up to 8 hours). When
chilled, sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over each filled shell and
place about 6 inches away from broiler flame for about 3 minutes or
until sugar caramelizes. Do not overcook or creme will melt!

Immediately remove from heat. Pour Raspberry Coulis over the bottom
of each of 6 dessert plates. Place a creme brulee in the center and
serve immediately.
