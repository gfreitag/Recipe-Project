Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Recipe Duck Confit, recipe
Follows
1/4 c  Minced onions
1 tb Minced parsley
10    Garlic cloves, reserved from
The confit
1 tb Cognac
1/2    Stick (4 tablespoons)
Butter
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Fat, reserved from the
Confit
Combine all of the ingredients, except fat, in the bowl of an electric
mixer fitted with a dough hook. Beat at medium speed for about 1
minute, or until everything is well mixed. Or use a food processor,
taking care not to puree the mixture or let it turn into a paste. The
texture should be like finely chopped meat.

Use immediately or place in an airtight container, drizzle some of the
reserved fat over the top, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1
week.
