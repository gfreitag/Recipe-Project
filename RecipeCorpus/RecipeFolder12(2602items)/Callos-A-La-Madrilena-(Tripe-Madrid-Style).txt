Place tripe and veal shanks into a large pot and cover with cool
water. Add 1 onion, cloves and 10 cloves garlic and bring to a rapid
boil. Reduce to a high simmer, cover and cook 45 minutes. Remove
tripe and allow to cool. Continue cooking veal shanks for another
hour. Remove shanks and reserve 2 quarts cooking liquid. Cut tripe
into 1inch by 2inch rectangles. Cut meat off shanks and cut into
1inch cubes. In a 6 to 8quart soup pot, heat olive oil until smoking
over medium heat. Add remaining onion and garlic and cook until
softened and golden brown, about 6 to 7 minutes. Add chorizo, bacon,
paprika, thyme and cinnamon and continue cooking 8 minutes, stirring
often. Add tomato paste, wine, crushed red pepper flakes and reserved
cooking liquid and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer uncovered
for 1 hour, or until it resembles a thick stew. Slice Morcilla into
1/2inch rounds and add to stew. Cook 5 more minutes until warmed
through. Season with salt and pepper and serve with grilled bread and
toothpicks.
