Title: Lemon Curd Tartelettes
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Sugar dough
Tartelette molds
(miniature)
Grated rind of 3 lemons
6 oz Lemon juice (about 5
Lemons)
1 3/4 c  Granulated sugar
5 lg Eggs
2 oz (1/2 stick) melted butter
Mix together sugar and eggs. Mix in lemon rind and lemon juice. Add
melted butter. Cook on top of double boiler over boiling water until
curd is thickened. Curd may be cooked in a microwave: on low or
med-low for short time periods stirring between each time, until mix
has thickened. This mix, while still hot will not be very thick. It
should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Cool mix at room
temperature, then refrigerate until completely cold. Keep
refrigerated until ready to use.

To make tartelette shells:

Roll chilled sugar dough on lightly floured counter or pastry cloth
approximately 1/4" thick. Make a cluster of the tartelette molds and
gently lift rolled dough on top of molds. Press down on molds. Shape
each shell into the mold. Prick bottom with fork. Bake at 350 on
cookie sheet until shell is golden brown. Cool at room temperature.

To assemble:

Spoon cold lemon curd mix into cooked cold shell. Keep refrigerated
until ready to serve.
