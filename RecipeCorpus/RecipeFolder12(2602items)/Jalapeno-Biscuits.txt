sm Pieces
1 ts Chopped jalapeno pepper, or
To taste
1/4    Cup, plus 1 teaspoon
Buttermilk
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or
wax paper.

Into a bowl sift dry ingredients.  Cut in butter with a fork or your
fingers, until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in pepper, to taste.  Add
just enough buttermilk, a little at a time, for mixture to come
together into a smooth ball of dough.  Do not overwork or overhandle
dough. On lightly-floured work surface, roll out dough into a 7-inch
round, 1/2-inch thick.  Using a 1-inch cookie cutter, press out 12
rounds. Reroll scraps to make additional biscuits, but these will not
be as tender.

Transfer rounds to baking sheet and bake 15 minutes, until tops are
golden and bottoms are browned.  Serve warm.
