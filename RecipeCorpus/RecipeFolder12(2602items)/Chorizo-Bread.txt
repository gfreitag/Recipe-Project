Title: Chorizo Bread
Categories: Emeril, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 lb Chorizo, chopped
1 c  Chopped onions
1 tb Chopped garlic
Salt and pepper
1    Recipe Basic Bread Dough for
Stuffed Bread (see above
Recipe)
1    Egg, lightly beaten with 1
ts Water, for egg wash
Grease a baking sheet.  In a skillet heat oil over medium-high heat.
Add chorizo, onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until chorizo is
browned and onion is tender, about 8 minutes.  Transfer to a small
bowl and let cool completely.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt
and pepper, if needed.

On a lightly-floured work surface, stretch bread dough into a rough
circle. Using a strainer, drain any excess fat from chorizo mixture,
then mound in center of dough.  Pull sides of bread up over sausage
to completely enclose, squeezing out any air pockets.  Pinch edges
together to seal. Knead lightly to distribute chorizo evenly
throughout loaf and form into a round peasant shape.  Transfer to
baking sheet, seam-side down, and let rise until doubled, about 40
minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degree F. Using a razor or serrated knife, cut a
shallow "X" in center of dough, and brush with egg wash.  Bake bread
until brown and firm, about 30 minutes.  Let bread cool in pan on a
rack 20 minutes, then turn out and let cool.  Serve warm or at room
temperature.
