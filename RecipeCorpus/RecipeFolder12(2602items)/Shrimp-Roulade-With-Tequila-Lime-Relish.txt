Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Chopped fresh parsley
1 ts Chopped fresh thyme
1 ts Chopped fresh chives
1/2 c  Cream cheese, softened
1 c  Fresh spinach leaves, washed
And blanched
8    Shrimp (15 count or larger),
Peeled and deveined
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1    Red bell pepper (roasted
With the skin, seeds, and
Ribs removed, sliced
And julienned)
2 tb Flour seasoned with salt and
Freshly ground black pepper
2    Egg whites, beaten until
Frothy
1 c  Fresh white bread crumbs
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Blend the fresh herbs into the cheese.

Blanch the spinach leaves for 2 minutes in boiling water and let cool.

Butterfly the shrimp (split them down the center, cutting almost but
not completely through) and open them flat to resemble a butterfly
shape. Dip the shrimp in cornstarch between 2 sheets of plastic wrap
and pound the shrimp to a 1/16-inch thickness. Place 1 spinach leaf
on each shrimp. Pipe a 2-inch strip of cream cheese from head to tail
down the center of the spinach. Arrange a strip of bell pepper along
one side of the cream cheese. Roll the flattened shrimp and
refrigerate.

A few minutes before serving time, dredge the shrimp rolls lightly in
the seasoned flour, then in the egg whites, and then in the bread
crumbs.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a nonstick ovenproof frying pan,
heat the olive oil until hot. Brown the breaded shrimp rolls until
golden brown. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 8 to 10
minutes. Slice on the diagonal. Serve with the Tequila-Lime Relish.
