1/4 c  Vegetable oil

In a mixing bowl, combine the beef and veal together.  Season the
meat with Essence.  Add the flour and toss the meat completely. Turn
the meat out onto a floured surface and with meat mallet, lightly
pound the meat. Turn the meat over and lightly pound the meat again.
In a large cast-iron pot, heat the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the
meat. Brown the meat evenly on both sides for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the
onions, bell peppers, and celery. Season with salt and cayenne.
Continue stirring, scraping the bottom and sides of the pot to loosen
any browned particles. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the
vegetables are wilted.  Add the tomatoes and garlic. Cook, stirring
often and scraping the bottom and sides of the pot for 3 to 4
minutes.  Add the bay leaves, thyme, oregano, basil, broth and wine.
Season with salt, cayenne, and black pepper. Bring the liquid to a
simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, and cook for about
1 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender. Remove the bay leaves
and serve with baked cheese grits.
