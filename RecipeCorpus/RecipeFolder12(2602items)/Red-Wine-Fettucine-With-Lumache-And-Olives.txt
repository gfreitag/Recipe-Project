Title: Red Wine Fettucine With Lumache And Olives
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
10 1/2 c  Flour
1 c  Semolina flour
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Dry red wine
1    Recipe lumache alla
Marchigiana
To Prepare Pasta:

Make a well of the flour and putting the eggs and wine in the center.
Using a fork, beat together the eggs and wine and begin to
incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough
will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board
and scrape up any leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly
flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough
should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another
3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the
dough in plastic and allow to rest for
30    minutes at room temperature.

Roll out pasta to thinnest setting on pasta machine. Cut pasta into
1/4 inch thick noodles by hand or with machine and set aside under a
moist towel.

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Heat snail recipe (lumache alla marchigiana) to boil and set aside.

Drop pasta into water and cook until just tender. Drain pasta and put
into pan with snails, tossing well to coat. Serve immediately in a
warm serving dish.
