Title: Chocolate Coconut Truffles
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Plus 12 ounces highquality
Semisweet chocolate,
Preferably Belgian
Or French
1/2 c  Heavy cream, warmed
1    Stick (8 tablespoons)
Softened unsalted butter,
Cut into chunks
2 tb Rum (optional)
1 ts Vanilla
3/4 c  Shredded unsweetened coconut
Toasted
Melt the 1 pound of chocolate slowly in a double boiler.  Cool
slightly, then combine with the heavy cream.  Stir in the butter and
rum and refrigerate until firm but still pliable, about 20 minutes.
Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a large straight tip and pipe
into teaspoon size mounds on a sheet of waxed paper, or, alternately,
spoon out the teaspoon size mounds.  Refrigerate until firm. Working
quickly to prevent melting, roll the chocolate into balls, then chill
again until firm. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade,
pulse the toasted coconut briefly to make it a finer to help it
adhere better to the truffles. When firm, roll each truffle in the
coconut, pressing firmly to make sure the coconut sticks.  At this
point you can refrigerate the truffles for as much as a day, until
you are ready to dip them.

Melt the dipping chocolate in a double boiler over hot, not boiling
water. Using a wire dipping spoon, or a regular teaspoon and your
fingers, dip each truffle briefly into the melted chocolate.  Remove
to a cake rack set over a cookie sheet until dry, and refrigerate
until firm. You may scrape up any chocolate that has dripped to be
returned to the dipping pot. The truffles will keep for several weeks
if refrigerated in a covered container.

Yield: 70 to 75 truffles
