Prepare White Wine Sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the
shallots, mushrooms, salt and pepper and cook until soft, 3 to 4
minutes. Increase heat to high, add the wine and reduce by half. Add
the clam juice and again reduce by half. Strain sauce into a clean
saucepan and add the cream. Bring to a boil and reduce slightly until
sauce begins to thicken. Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, Tabasco
pepper sauce and lemon if needed.

Preheat the broiler as hot as possible.

Brush 4 large dinner plates lightly with olive oil. Slice the salmon
in very thin escalopes and cover each plate completely with the fish.

Bring 1 1/2 cups of the White Wine Sauce to a boil and add the
cucumber, squash, tomato, and chives. Return to a boil and spoon hot
sauce over each plate, covering the salmon completely. Place the
plates directly under the broiler and cook 2 to 4 minutes or until
sauce begins to bubble and fish is just barely cooked. Serve
immediately with chervil sprinkled generously over each dish.
