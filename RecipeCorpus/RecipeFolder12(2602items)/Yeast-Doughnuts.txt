Title: Yeast Doughnuts
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3    To 3 3/4 cups flour
2 1/2    - ounce package active dry
Yeast
3/4 c  Milk
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2    Stick butter
1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
Vegetable oil, for
Deep-frying
Honey or Chocolate Glaze
(recipes follow) or
Confectioners' sugar or
Cinnamon-sugar
In a large mixing bowl combine 1 3/4 cups flour with yeast. In a
saucepan heat milk, sugar, butter and salt until butter melts. Stir
milk mixture into flour along with eggs, beating with a heavy-duty
electric mixer on low for 30 seconds, just to combine. Increase speed
to high and beat 3 minutes. Add enough of remaining flour, a little
at a time, stirring with a spoon to make a firm but pliable dough.
Knead dough on lightly-floured work surface 4 to 5 minutes and
transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover and let dough rise until it doubles
in size, about 1 hour. Turn dough out onto floured surface, punch
down and roll out to 1 /2- inch thickness. Cut out doughnuts with a
floured doughnut cutter; reroll trimmings and cut them into doughnuts
as well. Transfer doughnuts to baking sheets, cover and let rise
45    minutes.

Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 360 degrees. Fry doughnuts, in batches,
turning several times, until golden all over. Using a slotted spoon
remove doughnuts to a rack to drain. If using Honey Glaze,
immediately glaze hot doughnuts; if using Chocolate Glaze, let cool
first. Or let doughnuts cool and dredge in confectioners' sugar or
cinnamon-sugar. Yield: 1 1/2 dozen
