Title: Baklava
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Phyllo leaves (approximately
24    Leaves), thawed, wrapped
3    Sticks butter, melted
1 lb Almonds or walnuts,
Coarsely-ground
1 tb Cinnamon
Syrup:
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
Chopped zest of 1 orange
1/2 c  Honey
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Unfold phyllo dough on work surface until
flat. Place a 9 by 13-inch jelly roll pan over phyllo and cut dough
to fit pan (save scraps for additional inside layers or for another
recipe). Cover phyllo dough with a clean, damp towel. Brush bottom
and sides of jelly roll pan with butter to coat. Mix nuts with
cinnamon. Cover bottom of pan with 1 sheet of phyllo and brush with
butter. Repeat 7 times. Sprinkle with 1/3 of nut mixture. Cover with
3 layers of phyllo, each brushed with butter. Layer with 1/3 of nut
mixture and repeat with 3 layers of phyllo, each brushed with butter.
Layer with remaining 1/3 of nut mixture, and cover with 8 layers of
phyllo, each brushed with butter. Push edges of dough into sides of
pan to even them. Using a sharp knife, cut pastry into small diamond
shapes (with 1 1/2-inch sides), cutting through all way layers.
Sprinkle water over top to prevent phyllo from curling up. Bake for 1
hour.

In a saucepan combine sugar, water, corn syrup and orange zest. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in honey. Set
aside to cool slightly. Remove baklava from oven and pour warm syrup
over entire pan. Serve sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings
