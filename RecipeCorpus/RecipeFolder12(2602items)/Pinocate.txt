Prepare two cookie sheets lined with waxed paper.

clear liquid.  Heat liquid to 240 degrees F and remove to a cutting
board. Whisk the solution until it cools and begins to turn opaque.
Working quickly, add citron and pine nuts and stir through. Replace
over heat if too stiff. Using a small soup spoon, drop irregular
shapes onto waxed paper on cookie sheet and allow to harden.
