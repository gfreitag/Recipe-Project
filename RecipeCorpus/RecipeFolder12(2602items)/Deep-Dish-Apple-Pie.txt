2 lb Granny Smith Apples, sliced
2 lb Mclntosh Apples, sliced
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
Juice of one lemon
2 tb Flour

4 oz Wisconsin Sharp Cheddar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large sauté pan, melt the
butter. Add the apples and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the sugars, lemon
juice and flour. Continue to sauté for 2 minutes. Season the apples
with nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Mix thoroughly and remove from the
heat. Cool the mixture. Cut the dough into 2 halves. Lightly dust the
surface with flour. Roll out each half of dough to 12 inches in
diameter and about 1/8-inch thick. Fold one circle of dough in
fourths. Carefully lift the dough and place in a 10-inch deep dish
pie pan. Unfold the pie dough and spoon the apples into the pie
shell. Place the second round of dough over the apples. Using a sharp
knife, cut away the excess dough. Using your fingers, crimp the edges
of the pie firmly to seal the dough completely. With the same sharp
knife, make three slits, about 4 inches long and 2 inches apart,
across the pie dough. Place the pie in the oven and bake for 45
minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the cheese over
the top. Return the pie to the oven and continue to cook for 8
minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Serve warm with vanilla ice
cream.
