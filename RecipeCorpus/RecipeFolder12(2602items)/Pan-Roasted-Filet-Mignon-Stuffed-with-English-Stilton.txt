: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a mixing bowl, toss the
potatoes with thyme and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with salt and
cracked black pepper. Place the potatoes in an oven-proof sauté pan.
Roast the potatoes for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove the
potatoes from the oven and turn into a mixing bowl. Place the sauté
pan on the stove. Over medium-high heat, deglaze the pan with the
veal stock. Reduce the stock by half, about 8 minutes. Set the veal
reduction aside and keep warm. In a hot sauté pan, render the bacon
until crispy, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Stir in the
shallots, garlic, and walnuts. Saute for 2 minutes. Remove from the
heat. In a mixing bowl, toss the potatoes with the bacon mixture. Set
the potatoes aside in a warm place. On the side of each filet make a
2-inch slit forming a pocket. Stuff each pocket with 2 tablespoons of
the cheese. Season the filets with salt and cracked black pepper. In
oven-proof sauté pan, add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, sear
the filets for 2 minutes on each side. Place the pan in the oven and
roast the filets for 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare. Remove from the
filets from the pan and set aside. Place the sauté pan on the stove.
Over medium-high heat, deglaze the pan with the port wine. Reduce the
wine by half, about 5 minutes. Pour the vegetable oil in a sauce pan
and heat the oil. Dredge the shallots in the flour, coating the
shallots completely. Fry the shallots in the hot oil until golden
brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season the shallots with salt. To assemble, divide
the potatoes by four and mound the potatoes in the center of each
plate. Lay each filet on top of the potatoes. Spoon the veal
reduction over each filet. Drizzle each plate with the port wine
reduction. Garnish each plate with the remaining Stilton cheese,
fried shallots and parsley.
