Title: Roasted Potato-Chorizo Hors D'oeuvres
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 lb Baby red potatoes
3 tb Olive oil
1 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
1 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 lb Chorizo
1    Lime, quartered
1    Recipe Arbol-Avocado Salsa
(recipe follows)
In a saucepan of actively boiling lightly salted water, blanch the
potatoes for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tines of a fork will just
pierce the surface. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, cu them in
half and score the cut side of each with the tines of a fork.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees an heat a large cast-iron skillet over
medium heat. In a bowl, combine the potatoes with the olive oil,
oregano, salt, and pepper and toss together until evenly coated.
Transfer the potatoes to the hot skillet and spread them out into an
even layer so they are hardly touching each other. Heat until
sizzling, then transfer the skillet to the hot oven. Toast, turning
over every 10 minutes, for about 30 minutes, until very crisp and
golden.

While the potatoes are roasting, heat a large non-stick skillet over
medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons water. Cook the sausages for
about 20 minutes, turning occasionally and pouring off the fat as it
accumulates. Drain the sausages briefly on a double thickness of
paper towels and slice them 3/4 thick. Place a slice of sausage on
top of each roasted potato half and secure with a toothpick. Assemble
the hors d'oeuvres on a platter and squeeze a little lime juice over
them. Serve, accompanied by the Arbor-Avocado Salsa.

Yield: 6 servings.
