Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
7 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1/2 c  Chopped green onions, green
Part only
1/2 c  Minced onions
2 ts Minced garlic
Salt, cayenne pepper and
Black pepper
1 c  Milk
1    Egg beaten
1 lb Lump crab meat, picked over
For shells and cartilage
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
20    Saltine crackers, finely
Crushed in a blender or food
Processor
1 c  Dried fine bread crumbs
1 tb Essence
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 1/2 c  Creole Tartar Sauce, recipe
Follows
In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of butter.
Add the flour and whisk for 2 to 3 minutes, or until well blended.
Add the green onions, onions and garlic. Season with salt, cayenne,
and black pepper. Stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly add the milk and
stir constantly until mixture thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove from
the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine the egg with the crabmeat. Add
parsley and cracker crumbs. Mix gently so as not to break up the
crabmeat. Fold in the milk mixture and let cool. Divide the mixture
into 6 equal portions and shape into patties, in the shape of chops
if you wish. In a shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs and the rub.
In a nonstick skillet, over medium heat, heat the remaining butter
and oil. Dredge the patties in the bread crumbs, coating each side
completely. Fry the patties for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until
golden brown. Remove the patties from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season with Essence.

Serve the patties with the Green Onion Tartar Sauce.
