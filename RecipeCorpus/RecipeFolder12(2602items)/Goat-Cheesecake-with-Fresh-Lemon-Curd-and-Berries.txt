2 lb Cream cheese, at room

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan
with the tablespoon of butter.  In a small mixing bowl, combine the
butter and graham cracker crumbs together.  Press the crustinto the
bottom of the prepared pan.  In an electric mixer, beat the cream
cheese until smooth and creamy, about 5 minutes.  Beat in 1 cup sour
cream, Goat=s cheese, and sugar.  Beat until the mixture is smooth,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally. Beat
in the eggs, one at a time. Add the vanilla and lime juice and
continue to beat until the batter is full incorporated and smooth.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake the cake for about 1 1/2
hours or until the center is set. Remove the cake from the oven and
cool completely on a wire rack. Run a knife around the sides of the
pan and remove the cake from the springform. In a small bowl, whisk
together the remaining sour cream and Grand Marnier.  Spread the
mixture over the top of the cake.  Using a hot knife, slice the cake
into 16 slices, wiping the knife after each cut.  Serve the cake with
the lemon curd and macerated berries.
