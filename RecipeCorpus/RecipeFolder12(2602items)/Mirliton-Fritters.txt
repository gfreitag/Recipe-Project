2 md Mirlitons, peeled, seeded,
And cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 ts Liquid crab boil
Salt and cayenne pepper
1 tb Olive oil
4 oz Andouille sausage, finely

1/2 c  Chopped onions

3    Eggs
1 c  Milk
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper

Preheat the fryer. Put the mirlitons in a saucepan and cover with
water. Season the liquid with crab boil and salt. Boil, uncovered,
for 30 to 35 minutes, or until fork tender. Cool under tap water and
drain thoroughly. Mash slightly with a fork and set aside. In a saute
pan, heat the oil. When the oil is hot, add the sausage and render
for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the onions and continue to saute for 2
minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the garlic. Cool the
mixture completely. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and
cayenne together. Combine the baking powder and flour, whisk into egg
mixture in small amounts until all of it is incorporated and the
batter is smooth. Stir in parsley. Stir in the mirlitons and
andouille mixture and mix well. Drop a heaping tablespoon of the
batter into the hot oil. When the fritters pop to the surface, roll
them around in the oil using a long-handled spatula or tongs until
they are evenly browned. Remove the fritters from the oil and drain
on a paper-lined plate. Season the fritters with Essence and serve.
