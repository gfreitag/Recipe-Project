Make broth: Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add onion and celery and
cook for 3 minutes. Add smashed garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute.
Add wine, bring to a boil and let it reduce by half. Add fish bones,
enough water to cover, bay leaf, peppercorns and thyme. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and
strain through a very fine-meshed sieve. Return fish broth to washed
saucepan.

Reheat broth to simmering and add a generous pinch of saffron. Add
fennel, orange juice and zest, tomatoes and leeks and bring back to a
boil. Add clams and mussels, cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add
fish, shrimp, scallops, garlic and parsley. Simmer until fish is
cooked through, shrimp is pink, and mussels and clams have opened.
Adjust seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Serve soup at table
in a pretty bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and accompany with croutons
topped with a dollop of rouille.
