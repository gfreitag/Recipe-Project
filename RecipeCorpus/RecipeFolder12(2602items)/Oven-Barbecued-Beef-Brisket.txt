Title: Oven Barbecued Beef Brisket
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Ground cumin seed
2 tb Ground coriander seed
2    Cloves garlic, finely
Chopped
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
1 tb Cayenne pepper
1 ts Salt
1 tb Ground black pepper
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
3    To 4 pounds fresh beef
Brisket
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Combine all of the seasoning ingredients in a bowl and rub the mix
into the beef. Place the brisket in a roasting pan. Slowly cook the
beef for 1 hour, turn the beef and cook one hour more before covering
with a tight fitting lid. Continue to cook with the lid tightly in
place for 2 1/2 to 3 hours more. This will render most of the fat.
Carefully pour off and discard the fat. Allow the beef to rest for 20
to 30 minutes before serving.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
