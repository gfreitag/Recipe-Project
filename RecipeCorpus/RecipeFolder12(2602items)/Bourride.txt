processor and blend until smooth. With machine running, drizzle oil
into garlic mixture in a thin stream until a thick emulsion is formed
and all oil has been used. Season with salt and pepper.

Place 2 cups warm poaching liquid in a saucepan and add aioli. Whisk
until smooth and cook slowly, whisking constantly over low heat until
sauce thickens to the consistency of cream. Place 1 piece of toast in
each of 4 bowls, place 1 cod fillet on top of each and spoon soup
over. Sprinkle with Borage blossoms and serve.
