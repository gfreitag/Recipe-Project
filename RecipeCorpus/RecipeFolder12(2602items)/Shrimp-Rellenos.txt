1 1/2 c  Milk

In a large skillet heat oil over high heat.  When hot add crawfish,
green onions, garlic, Creole seasoning and salt; saute 2 minutes. Add
heavy cream and cheese, immediately remove from heat and stir well.
Fold in bread crumbs, transfer filling mixture to a bowl and let cool
15 minutes.

In a deep-fryer or deep heavy pot, heat oil to 375 degrees F. In a
bowl combine masa harina, 1/2 cup of the flour and 1 tablespoon of
the Southwest seasoning.  Fold in egg whites and add milk a little at
a time, mixing thoroughly between additions until all milk is
incorporated and batter is smooth.  In another bowl combine remaining
1/2 cup flour with remaining 1/2 tablespoon Southwest seasoning.

To prepare peppers, spoon one-quarter of filling into each pepper
through slit in side; reform pepper around filling.  Dip first in
batter then in seasoned flour.  When oil is hot (a drop of batter
spooned into oil should fry quickly), fry peppers until golden-brown,
turning several times, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted
spoon and drain on paper towels. To serve, divide salsa among 4
dinner plate and top with peppers; garnish with a dollop of sour
cream and a sprig of cilantro.
