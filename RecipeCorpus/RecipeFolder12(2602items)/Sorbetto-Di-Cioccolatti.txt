Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
7 oz Topquality bittersweet
Chocolate, finely chopped
2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
Find a medium metal bowl that completely covers the top of a small
saucepan. Place 3 inches of water in the saucepan and bring to the
simmer. Turn off the heat. Place cutup chocolate in the bowl and
place bowl over pan of hot water. Let sit for 2 minutes then stir.
Chocolate should be completely melted; if not, return to pot of water
to the simmer, turn it off, and replace the bowl, stirring until it
is completely melted. Do not let chocolate become too hot. Remove
bowl from saucepan and let chocolate cool to room temperature. In
another medium saucepan, combine the 2 cups water and the sugar and
cook over medium heat until all sugar has dissolved. Remove from the
heat and let cool to room temperature.

When both the chocolate and the syrup are at room temperature,
combine them

in a large metal bowl. Refrigerate the mixture until completely
chilled; it should feel cold to the touch. Put into an icecream maker
and freeze. Scoop out and place in a small container. Chill until
completely firm. Scoop and serve.
