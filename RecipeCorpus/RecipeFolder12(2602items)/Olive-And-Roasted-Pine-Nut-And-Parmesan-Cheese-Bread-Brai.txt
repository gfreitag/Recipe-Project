1 tb Sugar
1 c  Warm water (120 degrees F.
To 130 degrees F.)
1 tb Salt
3 c  Flour, plus 1/4 cup for
Dusting board
1/4 c  Corn meal
1/4 c  Olive oil
Add ins:

1/2 c  Black olives, chopped
1/2 c  Roasted pine nuts

1/2 c  Sundried tomatoes, chopped

Combine the yeast, oil and sugar together in the Kitchen Aid mixing
bowl. Whisk the warm water into the yeast mixture to dissolve. Add
the flavoring ingredients to the liquid mixture. Add the flour and
salt. Using a dough hook on low speed, mix the ingredients until
moistened. Change the speed to medium and mix until the dough forms a
ball and starts to climb the dough hook.

Turn the dough into a greased bowl and cover. Let rise for about an
hour or until double in size. Turn the dough onto a floured surface
and punch down. Shape the dough into a ball. Roll the ball into an
evenly thick rope about 2 inches. To braid the bread, line up the
three ropes, 1 inch apart, on a greased baking sheet, dusted with
cornmeal. Starting in the middle, braid by bringing the left rope
underneath the center rope and laying it down. Then bring the right
rope under the new center rope and lay it down. Repeat until the
bread is fully braided. Tuck the ends underneath to seal the braid.
Let the braid rise in a warm draft free place until double in size,
about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and bake for 20 to 25 minutes
or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and brush the braid with
olive oil and slice.
