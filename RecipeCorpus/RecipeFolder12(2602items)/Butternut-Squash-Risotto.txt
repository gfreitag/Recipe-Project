the onion mixture, continue to sweat, while stirring until

rice crackles. Add the wine, stir constantly until wine has
evaporated. Add half of the squash puree' and stir in enough chicken
stock to cover rice. Keep stirring until there is barely any stock
remaining, then add stock to cover again. Keep repeating this process

from heat. Add remaining squash puree, stirring vigorously until the
squash is incorporated with the rice. Put risotto on platter or into
bowls and drizzle brown chicken jus all around the rice on top.
