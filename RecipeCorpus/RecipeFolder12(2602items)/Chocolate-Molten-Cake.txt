Clarified butter
Cocoa powder
7 oz Valrhona extra-bitter
Chocolate
7 tb Soft butter
6    Eggs, separated

Gather together 10 to 12 2-inch-high cake rings. Cut strips of
parchment paper 1 inch wider than the rings. Brush both sides of
parchment strips with clarified butter. Fit inside of cake rings.
Coat inside of rings with cocoa powder and set aside on a sheet pan.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Melt extra-bitter chocolate over double boiler. Whisk softened butter
into melted chocolate. Remove chocolate mixture from heat and whisk
in egg yolks, 1 at a time. Sift flours together and fold into
chocolate mixture.

Mount egg whites to soft peaks and add confectioners' sugar. Whisk
1/3 of egg mixture into chocolate mixture. Fold in remaining whites
in 2 additions.

Pipe a 1/2-inch layer of cake batter into the bottom of each
cocoa-coated cake ring. Freeze until cake batter becomes stiff.
Approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Put a 1-inch piece semi-sweet chocolate
in each cake ring atop the stiffened cake batter. Pipe in enough cake
batter to cover the chocolate piece. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20
minutes. Afterwards, allow cake to rest for one minute. Serve with
whipped cream and Bay leaf sauce.

Yield: 10 to 12 cakes
