Make the crust.

In a food processor combine the flour, butter, sugar and salt and
process until mixture resembles coarse meal. With the motor running
add the egg mixture and pulse just until dough is formed. Wrap in
plastic wrap and chill 30 minutes.

On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough into a round 1/8 inch
thick and fit it into a 10 inch tart pan, pressing edge to 1/2-inch
above the rim. Chill until ready to use.

Make the filling.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Using an electric mixer beat the egg yolks until combined. Add 1/2 cup
sugar a little at a time and beat until lemon colored.

Pass the ricotta through a fine sieve into a bowl. Add the ricotta,
potato starch, lemon rind and vanilla to the egg mixture and beat
until just combined.

In another bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites until they
form soft peaks. Add the remaining sugar a little at a time and beat
until firm. Stir 1/4 of the whites into the batter and fold in the
remaining whites gently but thoroughly.

Pour mixture into chilled tart shell, place on a baking sheet and
bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and set. Let cool to
room temperature and chill 3 hours or overnight.
