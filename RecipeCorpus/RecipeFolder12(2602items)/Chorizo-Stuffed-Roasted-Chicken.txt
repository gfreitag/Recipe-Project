Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large saute pan, heat the
oil. When the oil is hot, brown the ground pork and chorizo for about
3 minutes. Add the onions, celery, and bell peppers and saute for 5
minutes, or until the vegetables are wilted. Place the bread in a
large glass rectangular baking dish and cover with the chicken stock
over the bread. Soak the bread for about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the
bread from the stock and squeeze each slice of bread, reserve the
remaining stock. Combine the bread and remaining stock with the
sauteed mixture. Mix well. Season the dressing with salt, cayenne and
a pinch of crushed red pepper. Stir in the parsley. Cook, stirring,
for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely. After
the mixture has cooled, stir in the egg. Season the entire chicken
with Essence. Stuff the cavity of the chicken with the stuffing.
Using butchers twine, tie the chicken to secure the cavity, legs and
wings. Place the chicken in the oven and roast for about 1 hour.
Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and continue to cook for 1 hour or
until the meat starts to fall of the bones and the juices run clear.
Remove the chicken from the oven and carve the chicken into serving
portions. Serve the roasted chicken with the stuffing.
