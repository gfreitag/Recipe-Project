Title: Coconut Cream Pie
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Blind-baked 9-inch pastry
Shell
2 1/4 c  Whole milk
1 c  Sugar
3    Eggs, separated
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1 ts Vanilla
1 3/4 c  Toasted coconut
1 tb Butter
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a saucepan, whisk the 2 cups of
the milk and sugar together. Place the pan over medium heat and bring
the liquid up to a simmer. Whisk the egg yolks together. Temper the
hot milk into the egg yolks. Whisk the egg mixture into the hot milk
mixture. In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining
milk, making a slurry. Whisk the slurry into the hot milk mixture.
Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook the
mixture, stirring constantly, until the filling is thick, about 4 to
6 minutes. Fold in the vanilla, coconut, and butter. Mix well. Pour
the filling into the prepared pan and cool the pie completely. Using
an electric mixer with a whip attachment, whip the egg white to soft
peaks. Add the remaining sugar and whip the egg white to stiff peaks.
Spread the egg whites over the top of the pie. Place the pie in the
oven for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the meringue is golden brown.
