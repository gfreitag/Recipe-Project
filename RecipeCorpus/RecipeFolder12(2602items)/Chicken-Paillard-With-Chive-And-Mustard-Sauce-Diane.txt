Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4    6 ounce chicken breasts,
Butterflied and pounded with
Meat tenderizer
To 1/4inch thick
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper to taste
2 tb Unsalted butter
3 tb Chopped shallots
2 oz Fine brandy
1/4 c  White wine
1 tb Dijon mustard
3/4 c  Veal stock
1/2 c  Heavy cream
3 tb Chopped fresh chives
Since each pounded, flattened chicken should have a large
circumference, it will be necessary to cook the four breasts one at a
time, setting each aside on a warm platter as you finish those that
remain or use two pans to cook two simultaneously.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat a large, heavy skillet
over medium heat.  Add 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the hot pan and
heat the butter until it begins to foam.  Add the first breast and
sear, cooking for 3 to 4 minutes on a side before turning it over and
allowing another 4 minutes on the second side.  Remove the chicken
from the pan and place on a warm platter.  Repeat for the remaining
chicken breasts, adding butter to the pan and sauteeing both sides.
After all the chicken has been cooked and removed from the pan, add
the shallots and cook two minutes until translucent.  Lower the heat,
move the pan away, and cautiously add the brandy.  Being careful not
to flame the brandy, return the pan to the stove, and over low heat,
allow it to cook off.  Add the white wine to the pan, raise the heat,
and bring quickly to the boil. Stir in the mustard. Allow this to
cook for 1 minute before adding the veal stock. Cook for 2 to 3
minutes more.  Add the cream. Bring just to the boil. Remove from the
heat and stir in the chives.

Place the ovenproof platter of chicken breasts in a preheated 350
degree oven for 1 to 2 minutes to reheat them very quickly before
placing them on individual dishes and topping with some of the Diane
Sauce. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes.
