Title: Spring Harvest Salad
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Fresh beets
2 c  Small fresh broccoli spears
4 c  Torn young dandelion greens,
Washed and dried
2    Green onions, finely
Chopped
1 lg Clove garlic, minced
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
2 tb Chopped boiled green peanuts
(optional)
3 tb Olive oil
2 ts Red wine vinegar
2 ts Balsamic vinegar
2 ts Honey
1/8 ts Salt, or to taste
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper,
Or to taste
In a medium saucepan, cook the beets in 1 quart boiling water until
just tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, allow to cool, then peel
and dice. Set aside.

Rinse the saucepan and bring a second quart of water to a boil over
high heat. Add the broccoli spears and cook until tender and bright
green, about 3 minutes. Drain and place in a bowl of ice water to
chill. When chilled, drain and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the beets, broccoli, dandelion greens, green
onions, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and, if desired, the peanuts.

In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegars, honey, and
salt and pepper. Pour this vinaigrette over the vegetables and gently
toss to lightly coat all ingredients. Serve immediately.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
