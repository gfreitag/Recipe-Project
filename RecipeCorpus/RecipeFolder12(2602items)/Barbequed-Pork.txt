Title: Barbequed Pork
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Boneless pork butt
Marinade:
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2 tb Dry sherry
1 tb Honey
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Bean sauce
2 tb Hoisin sauce
1 ts Fivespice powder
Basting Glaze:
1/4 c  Honey
1/4 c  Boiling water
Cut the pork butt in half, then slice each half into 3/4inch thick
strips. (You should have about 12 strips). Place the pork in a
nonreactive bowl. Combine the marinade ingredients in a small bowl
and pour over the pork strips. Turn the meat to evenly coat, then
cover, refrigerate, and marinate at least 3 hours or up to overnight,
turning the meat occasionally.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange a rack in a large roasting
pan, and fill the pan with 1/4 inch of water. Remove the pork from
the marinade and arrange on the rack. Roast for 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the honey and boiling water in a small bowl. After
45 minutes, brush the pork strips with the glaze, increase the oven
to 425 degrees F, and roast for another 1520 minutes, brushing with
the glaze every 5 minutes. When pork is cool enough to handle, slice
across the grain into 1/2inch slices and arrange on a platter to
serve.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
