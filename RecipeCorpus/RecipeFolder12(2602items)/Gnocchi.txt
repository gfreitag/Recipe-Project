1    Recipe Basic Pate a Choux
Because you will need to cook the gnocchi quickly once the batter is
ready, do the following before you begin making the pate a choux.
Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil and reduce to a
simmer. Have a large bowl of iced water nearby.

Make choux paste according to directions. Fill a pastry bag with large
plain tip #8 with batter. Holding pastry bag in over simmering water,
gently squeeze out dough, slicing into oneinch lengths with a paring
knife. Working in 4 batches of about 20 pieces, cook gnocchi at a
slow simmer, stirring occasionally, until they start to puff, about 5
minutes. They should resemble floating corks. To test for doneness,
remove a dumpling and cut in half. The center should have tiny holes.
With a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to the bowl of iced water to
chill. Drain well in a colander. Can be stored in refrigerator for up
to two days.
