Title: Chocolate Covered Peanut Butter Pie
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Crushed chocolate cookies
1 c  Peanut butter, in all
1/4 lb Cream cheese
3/4 c  Powdered sugar
2 tb Milk
2 tb Chopped peanuts
2 3/4 c  Heavy cream, in all
6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate,
Chopped
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, combine the cookie
crust with 1/4 cup of the peanut butter.  Combine the mixture
thoroughly and press into a 9-inch springform pan.  Bake the crust
for 8 to 10 minutes. In an electric mixture with a whip attachment,
whip the cream cheese and sugar until smooth.  Add the remaining
peanut butter, milk and nuts and whip for 1 minute.  Turn the peanut
butter mixture into a mixing bowl. Whip 2 cups of the heavy cream and
fold into the peanut butter mixture. Pour the filling into the
prepared crust and refrigerate for 2 hours or until the pie is set.
In a sauce pan, over medium heat, melt the chocolate with the
remaining cream, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is
completely melted.  Remove from the heat and cool for 2 minutes,
stirring constantly. Remove the pie from the springform pan and place
on a wire rack over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pour
the chocolate topping over the pie, covering the top and sides
completely. Refrigerate the pie for 2 hours or until the chocolate
coating is set.
