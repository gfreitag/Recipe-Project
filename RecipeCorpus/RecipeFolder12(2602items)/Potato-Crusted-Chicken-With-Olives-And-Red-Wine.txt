Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 lg Russet potatoes, about 1
Pound
4 tb Olive oil
3 tb Unsalted butter
4    Chicken breasts, skin off
And boneless, about 1 pound
Salt and pepper
3 tb Chopped shallots
1/4 c  Pitted Greek Calamata olives
Coarsely chopped
1/4 c  Dry red wine with dark rich
Color (such as Syrah)
1/2 c  Chicken stock
6    To 8 basil leaves, washed
And julienned
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees.

Wash and peel the potatoes. Fill a bowl with cold water and slice the
potatoes into paper thin slices on an Asian vegetable slicer or on
the wide slicer of a cheese grater. Put the cut potato into the ice
water and set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon each of oil and butter in a large saute pan. Season
the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and add to the hot pan.
Brown the chicken to a light golden color over moderately high heat.
Turn the chicken to brown the second side, then remove the breasts
from the pan, place in an oven proof dish and set aside.

Add the shallots to the hot pan and saute for 1 minute. Stir the
olives into the shallots, add the wine, and cook for 1 minute before
adding the chicken stock. Cook for 1 minute and then turn off the
heat.

Drain the potatoes and dry on paper towels. Toss the potatoes in a
bowl, with the remaining olive oil, making sure they are evenly
coated, and season with salt and pepper. Wrap each chicken breast
completely in sliced potato. Overlap the slices across the width of
the chicken. Place the potato wrapped chicken into the oven and roast
for 12 to 14 minutes or until the potato has cooked to a crisp golden
brown and the chicken is fully cooked but still moist.

As the chicken finishes cooking, reheat the sauce, cook for 6 to 7
minutes then add the basil.

Swirl in the remaining butter and spoon around the chicken.

Serve with fried spinach leaves.
