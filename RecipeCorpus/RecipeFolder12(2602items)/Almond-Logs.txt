Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 x  The Ultimate Butter Cookie
Dough
1    Egg white, slightly beaten
1/4 c  Finely chopped blanched
Almonds
1/4 c  Sugar
Prepare the Ultimate Cookie Dough and divide it into four equal
parts. Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes or refrigerate up to
4 days. Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper, or use a clean,
ungreased baking sheet. Place the egg white into a shallow dish or
pie pan. Mix the almonds and sugar into another shallow dish or pie
pan.

Remove one portion of the dough from the refrigerator and knead
lightly until it is pliable. Divide the dough into 2 parts. Shape
each part into a strand about 12 inches long.

Dip each strand first in the egg white, coating the strand on all
sides, then roll the strand in the almond sugar mixture. Place the
coated strands on the prepared baking sheet and cut each strip into 8
equal pieces. Separate each cookie slightly for baking.

Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes until very lightly browned.

Yield: 16 cookies
