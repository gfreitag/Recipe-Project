Categories:
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM----------------COOKING MONDAY TO FRIDAY #MF---------------------
6 sl Crustless white bread
3/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
6 c  Each blueberries and
Raspberries
Whipped cream
Cut each slice of white bread into thirds. In a nonstick saucepan
bring the sugar and water to a boil. Add the blueberries and simmer
for 2 minutes until they pop; add raspberries and simmer for a minute
or until wilted. Strain them over a bowl. Reserve the fruit and
return the strained juices to a skillet. Over high heat reduce the
juices until 1 cup remains and cool until room temperature. Blend the
syrup with the fruits.

Oil a 6 cup souffle mold. Line sides with bread strips and spoon
fruit and syrup in the middle. Trim the bread on the sides of the
bread so they are the same level as the fruits. Cover the fruit with
more bread, cover the bread with a plate and place weight on the
plate; refrigerate overnight.

Unmold (if possible) and serve with whipped cream
