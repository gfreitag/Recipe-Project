Title: Marinated Ancho Chiles
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
4 oz Piloncillo or 1 cup firmly
Packed dark brown sugar
5    Cloves
8    Allspice berries
8    Black peppercorns
8 lg Garlic cloves, peeled
4 oz Ancho chiles (about 8
Chiles)
Place all ingredients, except the chiles, in a heavy medium saucepan
and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and
cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes, until somewhat reduced.

While the marinade is reducing, look over the chiles. If they are very
brittle, place them in a steamer basket or platform and steam in a
tightly covered saucepan over boiling water just long enough to make
them slightly flexible. (Alternatively, wet the chiles slightly and
place them in a plastic bag; microwave on full power for 30 to 40
seconds.) With a small sharp knife, make a small (about 1 1/2-inch)
lengthwise slit in each chile and carefully remove the seeds and
veins, taking care not to split the chile any more. Rinse under cold
running water, drain, and add to the boiling marinade. Cook 1 to 3
minutes until the chiles are soft but not falling apart; the exact
timing will vary according to the age and condition of the chiles.

Place the chiles and marinade in a nonreactive bowl or container
(stainless steel, glass, earthenware) and let stand at room
temperature for at least 3 hours or preferably overnight.

You can drain the chiles and serve them as they are (no need to
remove the spices). I like to stuff them with different fillings, for
example; beef, pork or Chicken Picadillo or shredded cheese mixed
with scallions.
