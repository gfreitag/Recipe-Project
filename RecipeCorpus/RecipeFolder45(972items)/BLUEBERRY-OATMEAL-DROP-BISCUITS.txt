Title: BLUEBERRY OATMEAL DROP BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Unbleached flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Rolled oats (NOT instant)
1/3 c  Oat bran
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 c  Cold unsalted butter, cut in
-1/4-inch pieces
1/4 c  Granulated OR firmly packed
-light brown sugar
1 lg Egg
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Plain yogurt
1 c  Fresh blueberries
Preheat the oven to 400F.  Lightly oil a large baking sheet.

In a large bowl, combine the flours, oats, oat bran, baking powder,
baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.  Add the butter and cut it in with a
pastry blender until it is broken into very small pieces. Stir in the
sugar.

In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg, milk, and yogurt together.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients; pour in the liquid
ingredients and stir lightly. When there are only a few traces of the
dry ingredients visible, fold in the blueberries.

Using about 1/4 cup of the batter for each biscuit, drop evenly spaced
mounds onto the prepared baking sheet.

Bake for 20 minutes, turning the baking sheet midway through so they
brown evenly.  Serve warm.

These biscuits look and taste like oversize blueberry oatmeal cookies.

Makes 12 biscuits.
