Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Sweet bread, cubed, oven dri
1/2 lb Raisins
1 ts Cinnamon
8 oz Sugar
8 ea Eggs
3 oz Melted butter
1/2 lb Coconut, shredded
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 tb Vanilla
1 qt Milk, hot
The bread is important in this recipe.  We use the breakfast
pastries croissants here, but you can use any bread that is not
pre-sliced. The one I would recommend is an egg yellow color inside.
Cut it into large cubes, toast in oven in single layer til they're
like croutons. Place them in the pan you will be baking in. It should
be 2/3rds full. Add the raisins and coconut & toss.  Drizzle top of
all with the melted butter. Whip eggs till beaten, gradually add the
hot milk, then add sugar and spices and vanilla. Pour over bread
mixture and place in a water bath ( a larger pan than the pudding
pan- water filled 1/2 way up the outer rim of bread pudding pan).
Bake in 375 oven for 45 minutes to an hour. You should feel the
center of the pudding to be sure it is set. You can serve warm with
whipped cream or chilled as you prefer. Makes one pan, 8 X 10-inches
