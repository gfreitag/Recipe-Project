Title: BRAISED FENNEL WITH ROSEMARY
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
12 ea Garlic cloves
4 tb Olive oil
4 lg Fennel bulbs
1/3 c  Water
8 ea Sprigs fresh rosemary
12 ea Brine-cured black olives
Salt and fresh ground pepper
Lemon slices, for garnish
Bring 2 to 3 cups of water to a boil in a small pot and blanch the
garlic cloves for 3 to 4 minutes; drain. Heat 1 tb. of the oil in a
small skillet over medium heat and brown the garlic until golden all
over. Cut the leaf stalks and the hard butt ends from the fennel
bulbs, leaving just the bulbous stem, a piece 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 inches
long. Halve the small bulbs lengthwise; quarter the larger bulbs. In
a large skillet, heat the remaining oil and the water over medium
heat. Add the fennel in a single layer and the rosemary. (If you have
more fennel than your skillet can accommodate in a single layer, save
half the oil and rosemary to cook with half the fennel in a second
batch.) Cover and cook the fennel, turning once or twice, until water
cooks away and the fennel is tender and browning, about 15 minutes.
If the fennel begins to brown before it feels tender, add a little
more water; if it becomes tender before browning, raise the heat or
take off the lid to speed browning. When the fennel is tender and
browned, add the garlic and olives to warm through. Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Garnish with lemon slices.
