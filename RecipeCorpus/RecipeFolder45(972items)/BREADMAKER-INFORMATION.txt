Barb.For your information.Dak has a Turbo II B/M for $149.90 plus S/H
$14.00.Makes bread in 2 hours.They also have Turbo IV same time
element,but bigger loaf of bread plus whole grain breads can be made
in this one..$ 169.90 plus S/H  $14 .00.DAK's phone number for a
catalogue is 1-800-888-7808 or 1-800-888-0800.I also have Wellbuilts
model list. ABM 100 takes 4 hours.Price in stores here $ 149.99 plus
tax.After comparing it will cost me about $ 5.00 more to order the
Turbo II from DAX and have a faster bake cycle..I just don't feel
comfortable with DAK though.Well put aside my misgivings and order
from them beginning of the week.. Here are some 800 # for other bread
machine companies.
