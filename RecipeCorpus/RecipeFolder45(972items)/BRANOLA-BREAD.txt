Title: BRANOLA BREAD
Categories: Breads, Fruits, Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Large loaf
1 c  Milk
2 2/3 tb Vegetable oil
2 2/3 c  Honey
2/3 ts Salt
1 ts Brown sugar
1 tb Grated orange peel
2 c  "Branola" cereal
2 c  Bread flour
2 1/2 ts Yeast
Combine ingredients on the bread cycle.  This equates to a large loaf
in the Welbilt or Hitachi machines.

If prepared on the dough cycle, or by hand and after the first rising,
punch down and form into two loaves. Pop into two 8" loaf pans, let
rise until nicely rounded and bake at 375 F. for 35-40 minutes or
until the loaves sound hollow.
