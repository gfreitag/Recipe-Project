Title: BOILED RICE & VEGGIE PATTIES
Categories: Vegetables, Low-cal, Meat sub
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Carrot shredded
3/4 c  Rice brown cooked
1/2 c  Mozzarella part skim
1/3 c  Onion chopped
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1/3 c  Dry roasted peanuts
1 tb Parsley fresh
1/4 ts Ginger, ground
1 ts Coriander, ground
2 lg Egg white
1 tb Soy Sauce low sodium
1/8 ts Pepper
Carrots must be finely shredded and onion finely chopped. I use a food
processor. Shred the mozzarella and crumble bread crumbs well. Chop
the peanuts. In a large mixing bowl stir together the carrots, cooled
cooked rice, cheese, onions, peanuts, bread crumbs, parsley, ginger,
coriander and pepper. In a small bowl slightly beat the egg whites
then blend in the soy sauce. Add to the rice mixture and blend well.
Cover and chill in refrigerator for an hour or until firm enough to
handle. Shape the mixture into four 3/4 inch thick patties. Spray a
baking sheet with oil. Place patties on sheet. Broil four inches from
the heat for seven minutes. Turn and broil two minutes more until
set. Serve as you would a hamburger. I have done this in a skillet
but you must be careful handling the patties or they break up.  Be
sure to let the first side get well done before trying to turn them.
Helps to have frozen the patties for easy of handling before cooking.
