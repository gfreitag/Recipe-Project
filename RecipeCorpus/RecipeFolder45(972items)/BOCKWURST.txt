Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 16 Servings
5 lb Veal
1/4 c  Chives
1 tb Salt
2 ts Sage
2 ts White pepper
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Mace, ground
1 ts Cloves, ground
3 dr Lemon extract
3    Eggs
1 c  Cream, heavy
Small hog casings
Use veal shoulder or trimmings. Work veal twice through fine blade of
grinder and add to large bowl. Sprinkle chives, salt, sage, pepper,
sugar, mace, cloves and lemon extract over meat.  Add eggs and cream
and beat 5 minutes, until mixture comes away from sides of bowl. Fill
casings with mixture and tie or twist into 5-6" lengths. Bring kettle
of heavily salted water to boil.  Lower in sausages, preferably in
wire basket, and simmer very gently 2-3 minutes. Let cool in water,
then drain. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 days. To serve: simmer
in water for 10-15 minutes, drain and serve with bread and butter
with sweet mustard as a seasoning. Several types of sausages are easy
to make at home. Casings can be found in specialty meat markets and
are traditionally made of animal intestines. Saltpeter (remember that
from your military mess days?) is used as a preservative in some
sausages and is available in drugstores. Fresh sausages do not keep
well and should be used in a few days. The more spice, salt and
saltpeter they contain means a longer storage time for the sausage.
