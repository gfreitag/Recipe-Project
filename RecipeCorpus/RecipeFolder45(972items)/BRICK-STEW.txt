This is a recipe that was handed down from the days of my Hoboing it
all most always came out good.

First you find a red brick(One that has most of the mortar cleaned
off). Next go to the back door of one of the homes near by, and ask
if you can borrow, a burner on the stove to make your brick stew.
When the person asks what brick stew is you show them the brick. You
tell them that you might need to borrow some things to make it
better.Then go to work. Wash off the brick, put the clean brick in
the pot, add water to cover the brick, add the potatoes that you
borrowed,the tomatoes, the onions,carrots, and any thing else you can
get to stew, try to get some kind of meat allthough this is sometimes
hard to do. Add the meat to the stew. Now see if you can get some
salt and pepper it makes it tast better. Next bring to a boil and let
boil until done if you can borrow some flour do so and get some more
water mix the flour and water. With the pot at a boil add the flour
and water mixture to thicken the stew. Next  ask you host if she or
he would like to try some and if so borrow a dish for you and your
host, oh yes do not forget the spoons and crackers or bread. Next sit
down and eat your meal with your host. Then help with the dishes. Oh
yes do not forget to throw away the brick. Recipe by Charlie in
