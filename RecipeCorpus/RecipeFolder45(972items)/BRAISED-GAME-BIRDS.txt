Here's another recipe designed to reduce the toughest and oldest game
birds to tender, succulent meat. Whenever Parp comes home with an odd
assortment of game birds, this is how he prepares them.

Preheat oven to 325F.  Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet, 1
tablespoon at a time, and lightly brown the game bird pieces. Place
the browned pieces in a baking dish.  Add Wildfowl Stock, sauteed
onions, and honey. Sprinkle Rosemary in top.

Cover and bake for 1 hour.  Remove cover and add yogurt by the
spoonful. Return to oven and bake, uncovered, for an additional 20
minutes.

Remove meat from baking dish.  Blend flour and milk in a jar. Blend
this mixture into the pan liquid. Simmer over moderate heat for 5
minutes. Pour sauce over meat and serve with Steamed Wild Rice.

Yield: 4 servings.
