Walt:  I have a great recipe for brisket of beef.  It is easy, makes
its' own great gravy and tastes even better as leftovers. This can be
cooked either in slow cooker or the oven. Either way, put in the
brisket, mix the onion soup with 2 cups of water and pour it over the
meat. Pour the can of stewed tomatoes over the brisket. Place the
cookies in the liquid, not on the meat.  You can break them up to
fit. Seal the pan securely with aluminum foil. (If in a slow cooker
just put on the lid.) Bake at 325 for three hours without peeking !!
Take out the meat, and slice it thinly against the grain and return
it to the pan with the gravy. Reseal and bake at 225 for about one
hour. Make sure all the meat slices are covered by the liquid so the
meat does not dry out. This is tender and delicious. The gravy is
great over rice or wide noodles. FROM: BARBARA ZEGER (BNTH32A)
