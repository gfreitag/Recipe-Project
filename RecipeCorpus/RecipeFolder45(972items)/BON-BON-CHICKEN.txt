1 1/2    Tb Chicken Bouillon

Salt
1 tb Flour, all-purpose
1 sm Egg
2 c  Oil, cooking
1    Tb White Wine
1/2 ts Cornstarch for thickening
1 1/2    Tb Honey
1    Tb Peas, cooked
Cut chicken into bite-sized cubes, place in medium bowl and sprinkle

cornstarch with 1 1/2 tbs of the beaten egg and 1 tbs of water. Pour
the mixture over chicken cubes and set aside for 30 minutes. Drain.
In a plastic bag, mix together the remaining flour and cornstarch.
Add baking powder. Add drained (but moist) chicken pieces to the
flour mixture and shake to coat. Meanwhile in a wok, heat cooking oil
to 350 degrees. Add coated chicken pieces, about 6 at a time. Fry for
about 1 minute or until the chicken turns white. Place fried chicken
on paper towels to drain fate. Heat oil to 365 degrees. Refry chicken
until it turns golden-colored (about 1 minutes). Prepare sauce. In
another wok or medium-size pan, heat 1 teaspoon of oil. Stir in
ginger. When softened (about 30 seconds) add wine, bouillon and chili
paste. Heat to boiling. Gradually stir in a paste made from 1/2
teaspoon cornstarch and 1 tbs water. Continue cooking until sauce
becomes shiny (about 30 seconds). Stir in honey. Add carrots, peas
and deep-fried chicken to the sauce. Stir while reheating. Serve with
steamed rices. Sprinkle with the snipped green onions. Serves 2.
