Categories: Fish, Cuba, Update
Yield: 25 Servings
1 lb Dried salt cod
4 md All-purpose potatoes,
-peeled and cubed
2 ea Cloves garlic, crushed
1 tb Salted butter, softened
Salt to taste
Generous grindings of black
-pepper
2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
2 tb Minced fresh parsley
1 c  Cracker meal or very fine
-bread crumbs
Peanut or vegetable oil for
-frying
Fresh lime juice to taste
1 ea Drain the fish, place it in
-a small saucepan, cover
-with fresh water,
and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and
simmer 5 minutes. Drain and cool the fish, remove any skin and bones,
and flake. 2. In a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat, cover
the potatoes and garlic with salted water, bring to a boil, and cook
until tender, 20 to 25 minutes, then drain. 3. Mash the potatoes,
using a potato masher or fork, add the flaked fish, butter, salt,
pepper, eggs, and parsley, and mix well. Refrigerate the mixture at
least 30 minutes. 4. Sprinkle a light layer of cracker meal on a work
surface. Taking a generous tablespoonful of the codfish mixture in
the palm of your hand, form it into a ball about 1 l/2 inches in
diameter, and roll it in the crumbs; repeat with all the codfish
mixture, renewing the crumbs when necessary. 5. Preheat the oven to
250 degrees. In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or deep fryer over
medium-high heat, heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees, or until
a drop of batter sizzles when it touches the oil, and fry the puffs
until golden brown on all sides, turning with a slotted spoon. Do not
fry too many at once or the oil temperature will fall and they will
be soggy rather than crisp. Place the puffs on a paper- towel-lined
platter in the oven until all have been cooked, and serve hot,
sprinkled with lime juice. Makes 25 to 50 puffs Mary Urrutia
