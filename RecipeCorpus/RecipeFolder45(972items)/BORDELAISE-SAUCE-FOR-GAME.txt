This is a three step process ( four if you count making the stock in
advance) but well worth it as it makes a superb accompliment to the
finest game or beef steaks and roasts. The Matignon is similar to
Mirepoix. Carrot is traditional in the classic French recipe but
parsnip is more appropriate for game. Melt the bacon fat, mince the
vegetables and add to the pan with the herbs. Cook slowly for 15
minutes until vegetables are soft. Set aside and deglaze pan with the
madeira. Reserve the liquid. Melt in a heavy saucepan the drippings.
Add the Matignon and reheat it. Add the flour, heat and stir until
browned. Then add the pepper, tomatoes, parsley and stir. Add the
stock and simmer gently until liquid reduced by half, about 2-2 1/2
hrs. Stir occasionally and skim fat off the top as it accumulates.
Strain the sauce and stir occasionally as it cools to avoid skimming.
There should be about 6 cups. Set aside 5 cups for other brown sauces
later and take one cup for the last step. In a saucepan, gently
simmer red wine with pepper until reduced to 3/4. Add one cup of
Espagnole and simmer 5 min. Add reserved madeira de-glazing liquid
from step one and the diced marrow and poach it 5 min. Serve with
game or beef chops, steaks, roasted Fillet Mignon, char boiled cuts
and sweetbreads.
