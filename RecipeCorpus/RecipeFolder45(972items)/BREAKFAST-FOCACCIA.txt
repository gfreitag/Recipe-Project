==================
1. Place dough in a lightly oiled 10x15" pan. Stretch and press to
fill pan evenly. (If dough is too elastic to stay in place, let rest
a few minutes, then press.) Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap and
let stand until puffy, about 45 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, pit plums and cut into 1/4"-thick slices. Brush puffy
dough with 1 tablespoon butter. Arrange plum slices, without
overlapping, on dough. Brush fruit with remaining butter and sprinkle
evenly with sugar-cinnamon mixture.
3. Bake focaccia on the bottom rack in a 350'F. oven until well
browned on edges and bottom (lift gently with a spatula to check),
about 40 minutes. Serve warm. (If made ahead, cool, wrap airtight,
and hold at room temperature up until next day. Reheat, uncovered, in
a 350'F. oven until warm to tough, 5-10 minutes.)
