SAUCE A BOUDIN: When slaughtering a pig, collect the fresh blood,
immediately add salt and stir to prevent coagulation. Cut the fresh
pork, the lung, heart and neck into large pieces. Place the meat into
a large pot and add just water to cover the meat. Add the salt and 3
chopped onions. Simmer on medium heat for 3 hours. Remove the meat
from the cooking liquid and let it cool. Cut the meat into very small
pieces or grind it with a meat grinder. Add the meat to the cooking
liquid with the 2 remaining onions, pepper and spices. Bring the
liquid to a boil and slowly add the blood by pouring it through a
sieve. Stir constantly. Add the flour, mixed with a small amounts of
water. (The flour may be browned in the oven before being add to the
meat, provided that slightly more flour is used.) Simmer the mixture
on low heat for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently. This sauce
may served later by warming in a skillet. BOUDIN DES BRANCHES (BLOOD
PUDDING SAUSAGES): To make blood pudding sausages, prepare blood
pudding sauce but do not simmer for the last half hour. Rather, clean
the small intestines of the pig, cut them into 20 inch pieces at tie
them at one end. Using a funnel or a piece of birch bark as was the
Acadian tradition, fill the intestinal lining with the sauce until
the intestine is three quarters full. press out the air and tie the
other end, leaving some space for expansion. Put the branches in
boiling water and cook for 45 to 1 hour.
