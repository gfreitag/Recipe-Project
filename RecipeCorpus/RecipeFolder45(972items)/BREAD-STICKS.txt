Title: BREAD STICKS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
Pizza dough of choice
1/2    Stick margerine
Garlic powder
Parmesean Cheese
After making the dough for your pizza you place it on a piece of
heavy duty aluminium foil. Spread it into a circular pizza shape.
Take your pizza cutter and score the dough into 1/2" slices and then
cut the entire pie in half.  Melt a 1/2 stick of margerine and add
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder(add more or less to suit you). Spread
this on your bread sticks. Top the bread with parmesean cheese and
place aluminum foil directly on oven rack-no pan needed-at 450
degrees until crispy and browned. I always make an extra crust when
making pizza for my family. After eating the bread sticks no one
wants much pizza. I hope you like it. Mary in Memphis
