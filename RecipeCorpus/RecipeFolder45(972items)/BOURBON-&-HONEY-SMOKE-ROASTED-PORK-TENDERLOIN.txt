MMMMM-------------------------MAIN DISH------------------------------
3    Pork tenderloins
MMMMM---------------------GRILLING MATERIALS--------------------------
Charcoal briquettes
6    Wood chips (up to 8)
-- preferably fruitwood
Combine all marinade ingredients; blend well.  The marinade for this
dish can be prepared a day in advance; marinating should go on for 24
hours.

Lay the pork tenderloins in a ceramic or glass dish and pour marinade
over them.  Turn the tenderloins several times during the 24 hours
that they are marinating in the refrigerator.  When ready to cook,
pat the pork dry.

Preheat charcoal in an outdoor grill and soak the wood chips in water
for 30 minutes.  Add the chips to the hot coals. Roast the pork
evenly for about 40 minutes, until its internal temperature is 165 F.
If pork is to be eaten hot, allow it to sit on the edge of the grill
for 10 minutes or so after it is cooked so that the juices can be
drawn back into the meat.

Good served either hot or cold, accompanied by a green tomato chutney.
