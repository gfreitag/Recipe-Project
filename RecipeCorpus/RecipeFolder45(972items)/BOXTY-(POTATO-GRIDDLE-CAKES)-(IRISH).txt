Title: BOXTY (POTATO GRIDDLE CAKES) (IRISH)
Categories: Irish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2 lb Raw potato
1/2 lb Mashed potato
1/2 lb Plain flour
1 x  Milk
1 ea Egg
1 x  Salt and pepper
Grate raw potatoes and mix with the cooked mashed potatoes. Add salt,
pepper and flour.  Beat egg and add to mixture with just enough milk
to make a batter that will drop from a spoon. Drop by tablespoonfuls
onto a hot griddle or frying pan.  Cook over a moderate heat for 3-4
minutes on each side.  Serve with a tart apple sauce: or as part of
an Ulster Fry, with fried bacon, fried sausage, fried eggs, fried
black pudding, fried bread, fried soda bread... . An old poem says: .
Boxty on the griddle, boxty in the pan, if you can't make boxty,
you'll never get a man. . (The accuracy of the poem is uncertain.)
