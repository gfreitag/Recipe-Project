Title: BOILED BACON & CABBAGE
Categories: Irish, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 lb Collar of bacon
Medium-sized cabbage
(NB: in Ireland, "bacon" can mean *any* cut of pork except ham. When
people here want what North Americans call bacon, they ask for
"rashers" or "streaky rashers". As far as I can tell, "collar of
bacon" is a cut from the hock, picnic shoulder, or shoulder butt (I
am here using terms from the diagram in THE JOY OF COOKING). You want
any thick cut of pork, with or without bones, about four inches by
four inches by four or five inches. It does not have to have been
salted first, but if you want to approximate the taste of the real
Irish thing, put it down in brine for a day or two, then (when ready
to cook it) bring to a boil first, boil about 10 minutes, change the
water, and start the recipe from the following point. .

Place the joint in a pot, cover with cold water and bring to the boil,
Remove the scum that floats to the surface. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2
hours (or 30 minutes per pound). Cut cabbage into quarters and add to
pot. Cook gently for about 1/2 hour, or until cabbage is cooked to
your liking. (Test constantly: don't overdo it!) Drain, and serve
with potatoes boiled in their jackets, and a sharp sauce -- mustard
or (if you can get it) HP sauce.
