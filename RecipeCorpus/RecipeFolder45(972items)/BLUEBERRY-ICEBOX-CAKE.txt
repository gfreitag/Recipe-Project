Title: BLUEBERRY ICEBOX CAKE
Categories: Dessert. ca, Uucp
Yield: 2 Servings  1/2 cup powdered sugar 1 stick butter (1/2 cup) 1 8 oz package cream
cheese 3 beaten eggs 1 cup sugar Mix crust (1st 3) well and spread
evenly in a 9 x 13 pan. Cream last 3 well and Spread over cumb
mixture and bake 30 minutes at 350F.

Add juice of 1/2 a lemon to 1 can of blueberry pie filling. Mix well.
Pour over cream filling while still hot.

When completely cool, prepare 2 packages of Dream Whip and cover
entire cake (or use Cool Whip).  Keeps very well in the refrigerator
and in fact, the cake improves if it's allowed to sit.

Note:  I'm real big on real whipped cream, but the Cool Whip really
does work better with this cake.
