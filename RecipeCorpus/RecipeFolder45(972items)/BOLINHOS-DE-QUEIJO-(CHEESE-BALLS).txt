Categories: Try it, Appetizers

Salgadinhos are small, usually savoury, fried appetizers that are a
large part of Brazil's before dinner rituals. They are frequently
balls of fish, cheese, or vegetables which are served with a variety
of spicy sauces. These cheese balls would be prepared from the
wonderful white cheese that comes from Minas Gerais in Brazil. Here a
mixture of Parmesan and Mozzarella is substituted.

Mix the cheeses together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Beat the
egg whites into stiff peaks in another large bowl; and add them to
the cheese, and fold in well. Form the mixture into balls and roll
them in the flour. Meanwhile, heat 4 or 5 inches of oil in a large
heavy saucepan to 350 to 375^F over medium-high heat.

Drop in the cheese balls a few at a time and fry them until they are a
golden brown. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper
towels. Serve hot with cocktails.
