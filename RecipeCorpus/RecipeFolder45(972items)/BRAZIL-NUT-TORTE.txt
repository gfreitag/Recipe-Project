Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2 ts Double acting baking powder
2 c  Fine graham cracker crumbs
1/2 c  Soft shortening
1 c  Granulated sugar
3    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Chopped Brazil nuts
1    Teasp. vanilla extract
Milk*
3    Egg whites stiffly beaten
1 pk Vanilla-pudding pie filling
1 1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Heavy cream, whipped
Day before: Start heating oven to 375Ã¸ F. With waxed paper, line
bottoms of 2 1 1/4"-deep 8" layer pans. Sift together flour and
baking powder; add cracker crumbs. With electric mixer at medium
speed, or "cream" (or with spoon), thoroughly mix shortening with
sugar, then with yolks, until very light and fluffy--about 4 min.
altogether. Add nuts and vanilla. Then, at low speed, or "blend",
beat in flour mixture alternately with indicated amount of milk*,
beating after each addition. Quickly fold in egg whites. Turn into
pans. Bake 30 min., or till done. Cool in pans on wire rack.
Meanwhile, combine vanilla pudding with 1 1/2 cups milk. Cook,
stirring, over medium heat until mixture comes to boil. Remove from
heat; pour into bowl; place waxed paper directly on surface of
pudding. Refrigerate.

The day: Beat pudding until smooth; fold in whipped cream. Split each
cake layer- spread filling between layers and on top of cake.
Refrigerate at least 1 hr.

*With butter, margarine, or lard, use 1 cup milk. With vegetable or
any other shortening, use 1 cup plus 1 cup plus 2 tablesp. milk.
