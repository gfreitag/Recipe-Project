Title: BRIGADEIRO 2
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Condensed milk
Cocoa powder
Butter
Pour the condensed milk into a saucepan. Add cocoa powder and stir
until you get the shade of brown you wish. You can add one spoon of
butter if you like. Heat gently and stir continuously with the wooden
spoon until the paste begins to boil out of the saucepan. Pour the
brigadeiro into a soup dish and let it cool.

Then rub butter on your hands and on a teaspoon. With the teaspoon,
take a piece of brigadeiro and roll it with your hand until it
becomes a ball. Roll the brigadeiro ball in chocolate pieces and put
it into a paper mould. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #
