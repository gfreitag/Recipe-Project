Saute onions in oil in a skillet. Meanwhile, crush eggplant, nuts,
tomato, apple and garlic on a slab or pound into a paste with mortar
and pestle, adding water if needed to form a soft mass. (Tiny lumps
are fine). Blend spices into the paste, and then stir all into the
soft onions. Taste and adjust spice level--it is easy to add at this
point. Quickly whisk in enough water to make the spiced vegetable
sauce like thick soup. Pour over warm rice. Garnish with raisins or
coconut if desired.
