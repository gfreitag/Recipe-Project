Title: BREAKFAST BISCOTTI - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Break/brnch, Soup/stews
Yield: 7 Dozen
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
3/4 c  Light-brown sugar
1 1/2 tb Finely grated lemon zest
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 lb Whole shelled hazelnuts
-(about 3/4 C)
1/2 c  Golden raisins
1. Heat oven to 325'. Lightly oil and flour a large baking sheet or
line it with parchment paper.

2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, lemon
zest, baking powder, and salt until well blended.

3. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 C water, the eggs, and the
vanilla and stir into the flour mixture; the dough will be sticky.
Stir in hazelnuts and raisins.

4. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions. On a heavily floured work
surface, shape each portion into a log about 13 inches long by 2
inches wide. Place the logs 2 inches apart on the prepared baking
sheet. Bake until logs are firm and golden brown on the bottom, about
45 minutes. Remove logs from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack
for at least 30 minutes.

5. With a clean serrated knife, cut each log into 1/2-inch-thick
diagonal slices. Place the slices in a single layer on a clean baking
sheet (you'll probably need to use 2 baking sheets). Bake until tops
of biscotti are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Turn biscotti over
and bake until golden brown and very dry, about 15 minutes more. Cool
the biscotti completely on a wire rack before serving. Store in an
air- tight container.
