You can take this pie out of your freezer just before serving it.

Make pastry shell from your own recipe or use a mix; bake as directed
except remove it from the oven after only 5 minutes baking, and
reduce oven temperature to moderately hot (375Ã¸). Meanwhile combine
the egg with the coconut, nuts, syrup, flour, salt, and the 1/4 cup
sugar; spread in the bottom of partly baked pastry shell. Return pie
to oven and bake for 15 minutes; cool thoroughly. Crush the frozen
blueberries and combine with the 2/3 cup sugar; fold into the whipped
cream. Pour the berry mix- ture over cooled coconut mixture and
freeze. Serves 6.

When they are in season, use 2 cups fresh blueberries to replace the
frozen ones in this recipe; chill berry mixture before folding into
cream.
