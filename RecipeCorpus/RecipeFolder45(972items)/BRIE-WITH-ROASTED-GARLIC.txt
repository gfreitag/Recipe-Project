~Place whole heads of garlic in a heavy saucepan with olive or
cooking oil. Cook and stir over medium heat for 5 minutes. Cover and
reduce heat to medium-low for 15 minutes or till garlic is soft.
Remove heads of garlic from oil; drain on paper towels; cool.

~ To assemble Brie, carefully slice the thin rind off one of the flat
sides of the Brie wheel(s). Place on a baking sheet, cut side up.
Divide heads of garlic into cloves and peel. With a small, sharp
knife, slice cloves diagonally, being careful not to completely sever
each slice. Gently press garlic cloves into fans. Arrange garlic fans
and olives atop Brie wheel(s)*.

warm and slightly softened. Sprinkle warm Brie with parsley.
Carefully transfer to a plate and serve with apple wedges or bread.

* To make ahead: At this point, you can wrap the Brie whell(s) in
plastic wrap and chill for up to 3 days. Before serving, heat through
as directed.
