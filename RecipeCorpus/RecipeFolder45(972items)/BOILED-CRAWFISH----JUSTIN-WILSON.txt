6 ea Pouches crab boil
9 ea Lemons
8 oz Cayenne pepper
5 lb Small white onions

Bring seasonings to boil for 10 minutes.  Add potatoes, corn, and
smoked sausage.  Boil for another 10 minutes. Add crawfish. Bring

minutes. Drain. Peel and eat.
While water is coming to a boil, cull and clean crawfish. Rinse
well with garden hose and remove any dead ones.
Always wear gloves when you fool with crawfish, but remember,
they can still pinch you through gloves. Justin Wilson writes, "Not
everybody likes the fat, but I do, and I love to dig my finger into
the head and scoop it out.  During crawfish season, my finger stays
yellow from one end to the other." From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor
Cooking With Inside Help."
