Cook meat, liver, salt and pepper in water to cover until meat falls
apart. Remove meat and reserve some of broth. While still warm, grind
meat, onion, green onions, and parsley, saving about 1/2 cup of green
onions and parsley mixture.  Mix the ground meat mixture with the 1/2
cup pf green onions and parsley, rice and enough broth to make a
moist dressing. Stuff the dressing into sausage casing using a
sausage stuffer. May be refrigerated, may be frozen.  Prepare for
eating by steaming, as microwaving or frying will shrink and burst
casing.
