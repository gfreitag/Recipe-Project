Title: BRAISED LAMB SHANKS (PRODIGY)
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
4    Lamb shanks, about 12 oz ea.
1 md Onion; finely diced
2 md Carrots; finely diced
2    Celery stalks; thinly sliced
1 tb Finely minced garlic
1 1/2 c  Dry red wine
1 c  Water
1    Lemon; cut in half
1/2 tb Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy
roasting pan or Dutch oven large enough to hold the shanks in 1 layer
on the stove. Add the shanks and cook 10 minutes on each side. Pour
off all but 2 tablespoons fat; add the onion, carrot and celery and
cook 5 minutes. Add the garlic, wine, water, lemon, salt and pepper.
Cover and place in the oven. Cook 1 1/2 hours or until tender. Turn
the lamb every 30 minutes and check to ensure that the liquid has not
evaporated. If the pan is dry, add another cup of water. When lamb is
tender, remove the shanks from the sauce, strain the sauce through a
fine sieve and discard the vegetables. Skim and discard fat from the
surface of the braising liquid. To serve, arrange the shanks on a
platter and serve the braising liquid on the side.
