This recipe won in the Appetizer section of the Toronto Star's
Canada's Cooking contest for Canada's 125th birthday (1992); the
maple leaf shape is pretty but not necessary (can use a rectangle).

"Frozen phyllo dough can be found in most supermarkets. Sun dried
tomatoes and bottled roasted red peppers can be found in Little
Italy, some supermarkets ans most speciality food shops."

Preheat oven to 375F. Draw maple leaf on 12 inch square piece of
paper; cut it out. On lightly buttered baking sheet, place one sheet
of phyllo dough. brush on melted butter; sprinkle lightly with
parmesan. Repeat until all 6 layers have been used.

Place leaf cut-out on prepared dough; trace out shape with sharp
knife. (Remaining dough may be pressed into mini muffin tins and
topped with various pizza toppings.) Sprinkle asiago cheese over
dough; arrange vegetables on top.

Bake on lowest rack of oven 15 minutes or until pizza is golden
brown. may be served right away or reheated proir to serving.

* To roast pepper, place on baking sheet; broil about 15 minutes or
until blackened all over; turning frequwntly. cool; peel & seed.
