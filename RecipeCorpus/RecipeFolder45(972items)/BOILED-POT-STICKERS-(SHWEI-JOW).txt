Mash the tofu to yield about 3/4 cup. To make the filling, combine
mashed tofu with the minced ingredients, salt, soy sauce, and sesame
oil. To make the wrappers, mix flour and water by hand, kneading just
enough to make a ball of dough. Cover and let rest for at least an
hour. Place on a lightly floured board, and knead for 2 minutes or
so. With palms of your hands, roll it into a long, cylindrical shape,
12 inches inches long, 1 inch in diameter.  Cut crosswise into
1/2-inch pieces; you will have 24. If your climate is dry, keep the
dough covered. Shape these, cut-side up, into a round shape. Flatten
them with the palm or heel of your hand on a flour-dusted board.
With a pastry roller, small rolling pin, piece of dowel, or even an
empty jar -- all of these should be wielded under the palm of your
hand -- roll each into a round wrapper, 3 inches in diameter, thicker
in the center, thinner toward the edge. This is easily done by
rolling the pastry roller from the edge of the piece of dough to the
center, and back again, turning the dough counterclockwise a little
with your left hand after each roll. Continue all the way around
several times, also turning the dough over once or twice, until you
have a thin, 3-inch wrapper. To assemble, place 1-1/2 teaspoons
filling (or as much as the wrapper will hold) in an elongated mound
in the center of each wrapper; fold the dough over the filling so
that the edges meet. Press the edges together for a tight seal, at
the same time making four or five tiny pleats, pinched tightly flush
with the edge. Be sure that it is completely sealed to keep the water
out and the filling in. (With commecial wrappers, it may be necessary
to moisten half of the inside edge first to get a seal.) Bring 4 cups
water to the boil in a pot. Immerse eight dumplings at a time for 3
minutes (add an extra minute if frozen -- do not defrost them first).
Lest they break open, add a little water to slow the boil whenever it
becomes too rapid.  Stir occasionally in case some of them stick to
the bottom (true to their name). After 3 minutes, remove the
dumplings with a slotted spoon.  Cook the remaining two batches in
the same way. Serve hot, accompanied by small dipping saucers of soy
sauce and vinegar (cider or Chinese dark), mixed in roughly equal
proportions, or to taste, and thinned with water or mushroom liquid
if too strong; add perhaps a drop of sesame and/or chile oil. Some
people like to add a little crushed garlic, minced green onion,
and/or gingerroot. Advance preparation: These can be assembled ahead
and frozen. Do not defrost before cooking.
