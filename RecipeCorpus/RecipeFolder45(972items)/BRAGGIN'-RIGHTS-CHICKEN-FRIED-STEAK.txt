Cut steak into 4 equal portions. Pound until each is about 1/4 inch
thick. Place flour in a shallow bowl. In a second dish, stir together
baking powder, soda, pepper and salt; mix in buttermilk, egg, pepper
sauce and garlic. The mixture will be thin.
Dredge each steak first in flour, then in batter. Dunk steaks back
into flour and dredge well, patting in the flour until the surface of
the meat is dry.
Add enough shortening to a deep cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven to
deep fry steaks in at least 4 inches of fat. Bring temperature of
shortening to 325 degrees. Fry the steaks, pushing them under the fat
or turning them as they bob to the surface, for 7 to 8 minutes, or
until they are golden brown. Drain steaks on paper towels and
transfer to a platter. Keep warm while preparing Classic Cream Gravy.
Divide steaks among 4 plates and serve with mashed potatoes and
gravy. CLASSIC CREAM GRAVY:
After cookingf chicken-fried steak or similar dish, pour off the
top fat through a strainer, leaving about 1/2 cup pan drippings in
the bottom of the skillet. Return any browned cracklings from the
strainer to the skillet before starting the gravy.
Place skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring to
avoid lumps. Add milk and stock. Simmer until liquid is thickened and
the raw flour taste is gone, about 3 minutes. Stir the gravy up from
the bottom frequently, scraping up any browned bits. Season with
pepper and salt. Makes about 3 cups.
