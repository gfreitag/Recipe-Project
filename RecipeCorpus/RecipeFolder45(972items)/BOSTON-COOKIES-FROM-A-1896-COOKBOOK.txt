Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 1 Serving
1 c  Bitter
3    Eggs well beaten
2 ts Hot water
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Chopped walnuts
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
3 1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Currants or raisins
Preheat oven 350 F

Cream butter, add sugar and eggs gradually and add soda dissolved in
water, and one half of flour mixed and sifted with salt and cinnamon.
Add nuts, raisins, or currants and remaining flour. Drop by spoonfuls
one inch apart on buttered cookie sheet.  Bake in moderate oven -350
F 15-20 min. note: I would suggest cookies are checked after 8
minutes of baking to prevent burning.
