Title: BOUDIN (SAUSAGE MAKING)
Categories: Sausages, Meats
Yield: 1 Sausage
1 lb Hog or beef blood (1pint)
1/2 lb Hog fat
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Cayenne
1/2    Garlic clove
2    Onions
Mince the onions fine and fry them slightly in a small piece of the
hog fat. Add the minced garlic. Hash and mince the remaining fat very
fine and mix it thoroughly with the beef blood. Mix the onions,
spices and herbs. When all mixed take the prepared casings or
entrails and fill with the mixture, being careful to tie the casing
at the further end before attempting to fill. Then tie the other end
making the sausage into strings of about two feet. Wash them
thoroughly on the outside after filling and then tie again in spaces
of about three inches or less in length, being careful not to make
too long. Place them to cook in a pot of tepid water never letting
them boil as that would curdle the blood. Let them remain on the slow
fire till you can prick the sausage with a needle and no blood will
exude. Then take them out, let them dry and cool

Boudins are always fried in boiling lard. Some broil them, however.
