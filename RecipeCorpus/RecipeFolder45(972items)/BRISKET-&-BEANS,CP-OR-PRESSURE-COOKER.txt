Title: BRISKET & BEANS/CP OR PRESSURE COOKER
Categories: Crockpot
3 lb Brisket
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Green beans
6    Potato -- peel/quarter
1/4 ts Marjoram -- crumbled
Salt & pepper -- to taste
:

1-   Wipe meat and place in large pot. Cover with about 2 cups water.
Vegetables may be added to the meat in a crock pot along with
seasonings and the whole thing cooked 1O hours. 2- In a dutch oven,
simmer 2 to 2 1/2 hours before adding vegetables, then continue until
potatoes are done. 3- In a pressure cooker, bring brisket, water and
seasonings to 15 # pressure and cook for 3O to 4O minutes. Reduce
pressure under cold water, open cooker, add vegetables, cover, bring
to 15# pressure and cook 5 minutes, reduce pressure again.
However you cook it, remove meat, slice thinly on the diagonal,
serve with green beans and potatoes drenched with cooking liquid. Do
not thicken the natural gravy.   It has a lovely flavor and should
not be greasy. If your meat is not well trimmed, remove excess fat
before cooking. Should you have leftovers, heat the remaining liquid
and slice the meat for open face or French dip hot sandwiches.
