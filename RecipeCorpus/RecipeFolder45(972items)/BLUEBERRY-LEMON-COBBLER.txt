3/4 c  Unsalted butter
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 pt Blueberries
- rinsed and picked over

FOR THE DOUGH: Place flour in a bowl and rub in butter until fine and
mealy. Do not allow to become pasty. Stir in 1 cup of the buttermilk,
adding the remainder if necessary. Press dough together on a floured
surface, wrap and allow to rest while preparing filling.

FOR THE FILLING: Preheat oven to 450F and set rack in the middle
level. Place blueberries in a bowl and add remaining filling
ingredients, except butter. Toss well to combine and pour filling
into a 2-quart gratin dish or other baking dish. Distribute pieces of
the butter evenly on the filling. On a floured surface, with the
palms of the hands, press out the dough to the size of the baking
dish and slide a thin cookie sheet under it. Slide the dough onto the
filling. Cut 3 or 4 vent holes in the crust with the point of a
knife. Paint the top crust evenly with the buttermilk and sprinkle
with sugar. Bake the cobbler about 20 minutes, until crust is well
colored and filling is bubbling. Cool slightly on a rack and serve
warm or at room temperature with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
