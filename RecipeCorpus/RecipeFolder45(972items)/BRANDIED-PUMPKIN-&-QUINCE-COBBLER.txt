Title: BRANDIED PUMPKIN & QUINCE COBBLER
Categories: Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Quince (about 1 lg quince)
2 lb Sugar pumpkin
1/4 c  Brandy
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Light brown sugar
1/2 c  Currants
1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
4 ts Sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
4 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Buttermilk
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
2 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Maple syrup
2 tb Pecans
Preheat  oven to 375 degrees. Peel and coarsely grate the quince.
Peel, seed, and cut into 1-inch dice the pumpkin to yield 3 cups.
Toast and coarsely chop the pecans.

Combine the quince, Pumpkin, brandy, orange juice, white and brown
sugars, the currants and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a shallow 2-quart baking dish; let cool. The
dough: Combine the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder and soda in a
food processor. Pulse a couple of times to combine. Drop in the
butter and pulse 4 to 5 times.  Pour in the buttermilk and pulse just
until combined. (The mixture should be moist but not wet.)

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and pat out to a
1-inch thickness.

Cut into squares or triangles and place, in an almost scattered
manner, over the cooled fruit mixture, leaving spaces between the
pieces for steam to escape.

The syrup: Combine the syrup ingredients in a saucepan and heat until
the butter melts.  Pour over the cobbler.

Place the pan on a cookie sheet (to catch run-overs) and bake for 30
minutes, or until the fruit is bubbling and the dough has risen and is
golden brown.

Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Pass a bowl of whipped cream at the table, if desired. Serves 8.
