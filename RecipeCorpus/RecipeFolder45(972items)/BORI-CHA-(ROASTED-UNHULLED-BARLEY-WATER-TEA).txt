Title: BORI CHA (ROASTED UNHULLED BARLEY WATER TEA)
Categories: Korean
Yield: 5 Servings
2 tb Unhulled barley
5 c  ;water; boiling
"Koreans are not essentially tea drinkers like the Chinese or
Japanese. Upon being seated in a Korean restaurant or home you are
more than likely to be served a very pale-colored tea prepared from
barley. This brew, which has a light earthy flavor, is considered to
be a health tea, good for one's digestive system, especially if
sipped after dining. I prefer to take the tea in small Chinese
teacups at room temperature although it can be served quite warm or
cooled in the refrigerator."

1. Put the barley in a large skillet and toast over moderate heat for
about 10 minutes until the grains have turned to a dark coffee color.
Stir and shake the pan now and then during this time. Set aside and
cool.

2. Put the toasted barley into the boiling water and simmer over low
heat for 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the mixture and discard the barley.
Cool and serve at room temperature or refrigerate and srve when
wanted.

Makes 5 cups.
