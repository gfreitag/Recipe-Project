I've never even tasted a blueberry, but this looks like a good
introduction...

For the pastry, cut 125 g softened mono-unsaturated margarine into
250 g flour.  Add up to 70 ml cold water, roll the dough into a ball
and leave in a cool place to rest for 15 minutes.

Butter and lightly flour a 25 cm tall tin with a removable base. Roll
out the pastry and line the tin. Mix 20 g flour with 100 g caster
sugar and spread it over the bottom of the pastry case. Fill the case
with 750 g blueberries and dot them with a total of 30 g of
margarine. Bake in a preheated 240C oven for 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove from oven, dust with 50 g icing sugar.  Serve warm.
