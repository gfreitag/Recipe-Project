This curry-flavored meatloaf recipe made the rounds years ago, when
kaffir lime leaves were unknown here. Most people used bay leaves
instead, or even lemon oro range leaves from a backyard tree.
However, it takes the kaffir leaves to add the proper touch of
delicate, lemony perfume.

Soak bread in bowl with milk to cover until soft, then squeeze dry.
Saute onions and apple in skillet with butter until tender and not
browned. Add bread, lamb, curry powder, sugar, vinegar, salt, pepper
and raisins. Add one beaten egg and almonds and mix thoroughly.

Pack mixture lightly into 9x5" baking dish. Arrange lime leaves on
top. Bake at 350'F. 1 hour. Beat remaining egg with milk. Stir in
turmeric. Pour over meatloaf and bake 15 minutes longer. Serve with
rice and chutney.
