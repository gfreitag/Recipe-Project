Contributed to the echo by: Fred Towner Originally from: "The 100
Greatest Dishes of Louisiana", by Roy F. Guste, Jr. BOUDIN: Mince the
pork or veal and put it in a pot with the chopped onions, green
onions, garlic, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, salt, pepper(s), and
cayenne. Add just enough water to meet the level of the ingredients.
Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Put the ingredients into a
bowl and stir in the cooked rice. Adjust seasonings if necessary. Tie
the 4 sausage casings at one end and stuff them with the mixture.
Twist each 20-inch length into three equal lengths. Tie open end.

The boudin can be cooked covered in a little water, grilled or pan
fried in a little butter. Cut the sausages and serve 2 to each person.

VARIATIONS:

This dish is a good one to learn because once you have mastered its
preparation you can use almost anything in the place of the pork or
veal. Some of the most popular are chicken, shrimp, crabmeat, and
crayfish.

Bread is a traditional but not as good replacement for the rice.

NOTE: This is a great dish to make and it freezes well. Many people
cut the casing off the boudin before eating it.
