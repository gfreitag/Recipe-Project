Title: BLUEBERRY POPSICKLE
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Mixed drink

1/3    Part Blueberry Schnapps
2/3    Part Milk
Blue Cuacao
While on a bus trip for skiing in PA a few years back, we had about
1/2 a day to waste before boarding the bus to go home. In the ski
lodge was a bar and while at the bar the bartender made us all what
he called a blueberry popsickle. It was in a tea type of glass, 1/3
Bluesburry Schapps and 2/3 milk and enough Blue Cuacao to turn the
color a light blue. This is poured into a blender with ice and blend
until you have slush like drink. The bartender said that you could
use any type of milk that you wanted, powered, skin, and so on. I
have never found anyone since that has seen or heard of this drink.
It's great while in the hot tub. The bartender also said that you
could make peach or what ever type of schnapps you have with the same
recipe, just sub the Blue Cuacaco with a liqueur that will give you
the desired color.
