2/3 c  Water;boiling
2 ea Egg whites; stiffly beaten

Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water. Bring quickly to a boil,
stirring only until sugar is dissolved. Boil rapidly, without
stirring, until small amount of syrup forms a soft ball in cold
water, or spins a long thread when dropped from tip of spoon ( 240
deg. F.). Pour syrup in fine stream over egg whites, beating
constantly. Add vanilla. Continue beating with rotary egg beater 10
to 15 minutes, or until frosting is cool and of right consistency to
spread. Use wooden spoon when too stiff for beater. Makes enough
frosting to cover tops and sides of two 9-inch layers. Kate Smith
