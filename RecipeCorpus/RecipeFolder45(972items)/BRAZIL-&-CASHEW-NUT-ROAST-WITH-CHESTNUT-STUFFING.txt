-- finely chopped
3/4 c  Cashews, finely ground
3/4 c  Brazil nuts, finely ground
1/4 c  Flaked millet

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Heat the margarine or water in a medium frying pan over medium heat
and cook the onion until transparent, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the
garlic and celery and cook 1 minute longer.

Put the mixture in a large bowl with the cashews and Brazil nuts,
millet, bread crumbs, potatoes, herbs and spices, lemon juice, and
grated rind. Add enough wine, stock, or water to moisten the mixture
so it holds together. Season lightly with salt and pepper and mix
well.

Put half the mixture in a 8-1/2 x 4-1/2-inch loaf pan.  Cover with
chestnut puree, then add the remaining loaf mixture.  Bake for 45
minutes.

If desired, serve with gravy.
