Title: BRAZIL & BULGAR WHEAT BURGERS
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Olive Oil
2    Onions
2    Celery Sticks
2    Garlic cloves
125 g  Bulgar Wheat
250 g  Brazil Nuts
300 ml Vegetable stock
2 tb Tomato puree
2 tb Parsley (chopped)
2 ts Dried mixed herbs
1    Egg (beaten
In a food processor chop finely the onion, garlic and celery.
Seperatly chop nuts and set aside.

Heat oil and add the onion, garlic and celery - saute until soft. Add
the nuts and Bulgar wheat and saute for a couple of minutes until
golden brown. Add the stock and simmer until the liquid is absorbed.

Stir in tomato puree, parsley, herbs and the egg. Season with salt and
pepper and leave until cool enough to handle.

Shape into 'burgers' and either cook in oven at 400F/200C/Gas 6 for
15 to 20 minutes until heated through or cook in frying pan. Place in
burger buns with your favorite garnishes - I like cooked onion rings,
lettuce, cheese and fresh tomato.

If you have problems with the burgers falling apart when cooking try
adding some grated cheese before shaping - this helps.

An alternate serving suggestion is like a falafal. Take tablespoon
sized amounts of mixture and fry in some oil until gold to dark
brown. Put inside lightly warmed Pita bread with some salad and
Chilli sauce.

You can substitute your favorite nuts for the Brazils.
