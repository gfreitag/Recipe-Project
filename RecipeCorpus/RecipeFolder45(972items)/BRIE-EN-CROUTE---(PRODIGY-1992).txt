Mix the ream with the herbed cheese,  Spread on top of brie. Roll out
both sheets of puff pastry to 14" squares. Place brie in center of

with the egg wash, center the bottom of the brie on pastry. Make
diagonal cuts in the edge of the pastry; brush with the egg wash, if
it becomes dry, and fold against the side of the brie.  (Diagonal
slits will help the pastry fit better.) Now, cut a second round of
pastry from the other 14" square, egg wash, and then place the on top
of the brie in the center. Make more diagonal slits to fit.  Use egg
wash if necessary, and firmly press pastry dough to the sides of the
brie. With a sharp knife, trim the excess. Take the scraps of pastry
and make decorations, etc.  (You may cover this and refrigerate
overnight, or at this point, freeze for up to 2 weeks.)

degrees. Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake 35 to 40 minutes or
until the pastry is golden. Let it rest at room temperature for 2
hours before serving or the cheese will be too soft to cut. Serve
this cut in small wedges.  It will serve 18 to 20.
