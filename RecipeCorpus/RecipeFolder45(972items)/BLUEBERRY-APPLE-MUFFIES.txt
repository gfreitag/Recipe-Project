Categories: Muffins
Yield: 20 Servings
1 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Sugar
1 ea Large egg
1/4 c  Low-fat buttermilk
3 tb Butter, melted
1/2 c  Minced unpeeled tart apple

Combine dry ingredients in 1-quart mixing bowl. Mix well. Add egg,
buttermilk, butter and minced apple to bowl. Stir to combine

blueberries are frozen, bake batter immediately. Otherwise, chill

baking sheets. Sprinkle with more cereal, if desired. Bake in center

very lightly browned, about 7-8 minutes, rotating pans if browning
irregularly. Do not overbake. Cool on racks. Makes 20 (3- inch)
muffies.
