Title: BLUEBERRY SWIRL CHEESECAKE
Categories: Cheesecakes, Fruits, Cheese
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Sugar
3    Eggs
1/4 c  Butter -- melted
1 ts Vanilla
2 tb Butter -- melted
1 cn Blueberry Pie Filling
24 oz Cheese, Cream -- soft
Combine first 3 ingredients, mixing well. Press into bottom and up
sides of 9 in. spring form pan; set aside. Beat cream cheese with
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually add 1 cup sugar,
mixing well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Add 1 tsp of vanilla and finish beating. Pour half of the
batter into the prepared pan. Spoon the pie filling on top of the
batter in a ring pattern about halfway from the edge of the cake. Be
careful not to spoon too much filling. I used half the can and
reserved the rest for topping the individual slices. Bake at 375 deg
for 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature on a wire rack;
refrigerate 12 hours. Remove sides of pan. Hint:To keep the top from
cracking, turn off oven 5 minutes before 30 minutes are up. Let cake
cool with the oven being careful not to let cake burn.
