Title: BREAD SAUCE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Milk; Hot
2 tb Butter Or Margarine
1/4 ts Salt
White Bread; Crust Removed *
*  Use 3 to 4 slices of bread for a thin sauce, 6 to 7 slices for
medium sauce and 9 to 10 slices of bread for a thick sauce. Unless a
white-colored sauce is desired, leave the bread crusts on and use
less bread.

Warm the blender container by filling it with hot water and letting it
stand a minute or two then empty the water out. Put the hot milk,
butter or margarine and salt in the blender container and blend until
well mixed.
With the blender running, break the bread into pieces and add to the
blender container.  Stop the blender occasionally to check the
consistency. Serve at once or keep hot in a sauce warmer.

Makes 1 1/4 cups.
