Hints/tips follows
*Make clean-up easy by spraying the kneading paddle of your machine
with nonstick spray coating before adding ingredients and by soaking
the paddle and pan in hot soapy water immediately after removing the
baked bread.

*Use the end of the handle of a wooden spoon to remove the kneading
paddle from the hot loaf of bread.

*When rolling out dough mixed in a machine, stop and let the bread
rest about 5 minutes; then finish rolling it out. The dough is very
elastic and letting it rest makes it easier to shape.

*To store baked bread, cool it completely; it will take several
hours. Wrap it in foil or plastic wrap, or place it in a plastic bag.
Store it in a cool, dry place up to 3 days. To freeze yeast bread,
place bread in a freezer bag or container, or tightly wrap it in
heavy foil. Freeze it up to 3 months. Bread can be thawed in the
package for 1 hour or wrapped in foil and reheated in a 300* oven
about 20 minutes. From: Bread Machine Bounty-Better Homes and Garden
