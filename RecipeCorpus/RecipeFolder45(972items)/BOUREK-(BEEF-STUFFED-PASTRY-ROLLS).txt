Title: BOUREK (BEEF-STUFFED PASTRY ROLLS)
Categories: Algerian, Hamburger, Holiday
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 sm Onion; chopped (1/4 cup)
1/2 lb Ground beef
1/2 ts Salt; or to taste
1/4 ts Black pepper
1    Egg; beaten
2 tb Flat leaf parsley; chopped
6    Phyllo sheets; 12x17" ea
Lemon wedges for serving
When the fast of Ramadhan is broken in the early evening hours,
various dishes are considered a traditional part of the meal. This is
one of those dishes.

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet, add the onion and
stir-fry over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Add the beef, salt and
pepper and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add the egg and parsley and fry
for 1 minute more. Cool well.

2. Take 1 phyllo sheet and spread it out flat with a short end
nearest you. Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the beef mixture 2 inches
in from the short edge. Fold both long sides in toward the middle,
beginning with the short end roll the phyllo to shape a packet 4
inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Repeat with all the remaining
phyllo sheets and stuffing. Set aside.

3. Put the balance of the oil in a skillet over moderate/low heat and
add the rolls. Brown on both sides for about 3 minutes; the low heat
prevents the very thin pastry sheets from burning. Drain the rolls on
paper towels for a minute.

Serve warm with a squeeze of lemon juice. Makes 6.
