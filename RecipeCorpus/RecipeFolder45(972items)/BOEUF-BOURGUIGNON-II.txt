Recipe by: The New York Times Cookbook 1. Roll the beef cubes in
flour and brown them on all sides in a skillet over high heat in four
tablespoons each of the butter and olive oil.

2.  Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper, pour the cognac over it
and ignite.  When the flame dies, transfer the meat to a three-quart
casserole.

3.  Preheat oven to moderate (350F)

4.  To the skillet add the bacon, garlic, carrots, leeks, chopped
onions and two tablespoons chopped parsley. Cook, stirring, until the
bacon is crisp and the vegetables are lightly browned. Transfer to
the casserole with the meat and add the bay leaf, thyme, Burgundy and
enough water to barely cover the meat. Cover and bake 1 1/2 hours.

5.  Prepare a beurre manie by blending one tablespoon each butter and
flour and stir into the casserole bit by bit. Return the casserole to
the oven and continue cooking 2 - 3 hours longer.

6.  Brown the small onions in 2 tablespoons butter with a dash of
sugar. Add a little water, cover and cook until the onions are almost
tender.

7.  Saute the mushrooms in two tablespoons each of the butter and oil
until lightly browned on one side. Sprinkle with lemon juice and turn
to brown the other side.

8.  To serve, add the onions to the casserole and garnish with the
mushrooms and parsley.
