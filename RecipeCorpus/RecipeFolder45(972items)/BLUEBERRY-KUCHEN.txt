resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle with the vinegar and shape gently
into dough. Press dough into an ungreased 9-inch round cake pan to a

Place in the oven on the lowest rack and bake for 50 minutes or until
the crust is golden and the filling bubbles.

Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with the remaining 2
cups of blueberries. Let the kuchen rest at room temperature for
about an hour. Then sprinkle with the powdered sugar and serve.
