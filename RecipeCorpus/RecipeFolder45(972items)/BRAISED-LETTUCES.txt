Title: BRAISED LETTUCES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
1    Head escarole
2    Belgian endives
1    Boston lettuce
2 tb Minced garlic
1 ts Ground coriander
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Rosemary
1 c  Water
2 tb White wine vinegar
1/4 c  Whipping cream
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. TRIM and discard the outer leaves from the
escarole, leaving the lighter green center. Cut in half from root to
tip. Trim and discard any discolored outer leaves of endive and
Boston lettuce and cut them in half from root to tip. Heat the olive
oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add the lettuces. Cook
until golden on both sides. If lettuces don't fit in the skillet,
perform this operation in batches. Add garlic, coriander, thyme,
rosemary, water and vinegar, cover, place in oven and cook 15
minutes. Transfer the skillet to the stove top and remove the
lettuces. Let cool on a plate. Press the lettuces and add any
braising liquid to the skillet. Add the cream and cook until the
liquid becomes saucelike. Pour into a bowl and let cool. To serve,
cut halves of Boston lettuce and escarole in half. Arrange all
lettuces on a platter and pour the sauce over the top.
