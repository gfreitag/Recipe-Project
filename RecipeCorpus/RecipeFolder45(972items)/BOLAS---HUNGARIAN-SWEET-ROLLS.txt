1 pk Dry active yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (110 to 115
-degrees)
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs at room temperature,
-slightly beaten
4 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour,
-divided
1 1/2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar,
-divided
1/2 c  Currants
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1 ts Grated lemon zest
1 ts Grated orange zest
1/4 c  Orange juice
In a small bowl, stir yeast into warm water and set aside.

Warm milk and pour over sugar, butter and salt in large bowl; cool to
lukewarm.

Blend in eggs and yeast mixture, then add 4 cups flour and stir to
make soft dough. Turn out on floured board, knead remaining flour
into dough, and knead until smooth and satiny, about 5 minutes. Place
in greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in
warm place until double, about 1 hour.

Punch down. Roll into 28-by-14-inch rectangle. Combine 1/2 cup of the
brown sugar, currants, pecans, lemon and orange zest; sprinkle evenly
over dough.

Beginning with wide side, roll dough up tightly. Cut into 18 1 1/2
inch pieces.

In pan, combine remaining 1 cup brown sugar, and orange juice; cook
over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture boils and
sugar melts.

Divide syrup into 2 well-buttered 8-inch square pans. Arrange 9
pinwheels of rolled dough in each pan. Cover and let rise until
doubled, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, until lightly
browned. Invert onto heated platter and serve.
