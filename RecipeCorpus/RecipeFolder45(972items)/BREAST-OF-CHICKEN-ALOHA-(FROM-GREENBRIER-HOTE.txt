Season chicken with salt, allspice, and freshly ground pepper, then
wet it with coconut milk.  Let it settle for a few hours. Toast
coconut until light brown. One hr. before using, make egg batter of 2
eggs and 1/3 cup of coconut milk.  Roll chicken in the toasted
coconut, then dip in egg batter, and fry in clarified butter in a
skillet until golden brown, approx. 25 min.  Serves 2.

To make coconut milk: Grate the meat from a quarter of a fresh
coconut. Pour 1 cup hot milk over it and let stand 1 hour. Strain
through 2 thicknesses of cheesecloth and squeeze dry. Makes 1 cup.

To clarify butter:  Melt butter in small pan over low heat. Pour off
the clear golden liquid and discard the milky sediment remaining in
the pan.
