juice, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt 2 T. of the butter in
a 9-inch skillet. When butter foams, add breasts and suate 3 minutes
on each side. Do not overcook. Make a shallow cut in one of the
breasts with a sharp knife. The meat should be pink and the juice
that run out should be clear yellow. Remove breasts from skillet nad
keep warm. Add shallots to dripping and saute until golden brown.
Drain butter from shallots and reserve. Add brandy and wine and
reduce to half its volume. Add cream and Meat Glaze and reduce to
half its volume gain. Strain sauce, and add the remaining 1 T. lemon
juice, the remaining T. butter and cayenne. Mix truffles and
mushrooms, and divide into 2 portions. Place warm breasts on a
serving dish. Top each with truffles and mushrooms. Pour sauce over
breasts and cover with a glass cover. Recipe from the Greenbrier
Hotel.
