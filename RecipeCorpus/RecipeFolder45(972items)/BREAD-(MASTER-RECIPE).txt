Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Cake compressed yeast
OR 1/2  cake dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Melted shortening
1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
5    To 5 1/4 cups flour
Soften yeast in water.  Add sugar, salt, and shortening. Add flour
gradually, beating thoroughly after each addition until the dough is
just stiff enough to knead. Turn onto lightly floured board. Knead
until dough is smooth and elastic.  Cover with a warm, damp cloth.
Set in warm place and allow to double in bulk. (If dry yeast is used
allow dough to rise overnight in warm place.) Work down, cover with a
warm, damp cloth, and allow dough to again double in bulk. Work down
lightly. Form into loaves. Place in well-oiled pans. Again cover with
a warm, damp cloth. Set in a warm place, cover, and let rise until
double in bulk. Bake in hot oven (450 F) for 15 minutes. Reduce the
heat slightly and continue baking (410 - 425 F) for the remainder of
the time. Total baking time 40-45 minutes. From 4- 4 1/2 hours are
required for the entire process. 2 medium sized loaves. The Household
