Cherries
(preferably canned in
Water)
1/4 c  Brandy or cognac
2/3 c  Sugar
Butter for pan
2/3 c  All-purpose flour -- sifted
1 c  Milk
3 lg Eggs
1 tb Vanilla extract
1/8 ts Allspice

In nonreactive bowl, mix drained cherries, brandy and 1/3 cup of the
sugar. Let sit for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 9-inch pie pan.

Place flour in medium bowl and make a well in the center.

Drain cherries, reserving the liquid. Pour liquid into a blender and
add remaining  1/3 cup sugar, plus the milk, eggs, vanilla, allspice,
lemon zest and salt. Blend well.

Pour liquid mixture into the well in the flour and blend into a smooth

fruit. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to
350 and bake 45 to 50 minutes more until claf outi is puffy and
golden. (A sharp knife inserted in the center should come out clean.)
Let cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.

NOTES : An adaptation of a recipe from New York chef and cooking
teacher Katherine Alford, this is elegant, impressive and easy to
make. In the summer you can make this with fresh cherries, but it
works just as well now with canned. Recipe By
