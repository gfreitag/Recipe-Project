Tofu Tartar Sauce (recipe

Fresh parsley
To defrost tofu, place plastic bag filled with frozen tofu into bowl
of hot water.  After about 15 minutes, drain bowl and ad more hot
water. Repeat process until tofu is soft. Remove tofu from plastic
bag, rinse, and then squeeze out excess water by placing cakes
between two plates and pressing plates together while tipping out
water. Cut tofu horizontally into
1/2    inch thick slices. In large shallow pot, combine water,
ginger, and soy sauce. Simmer sliced tofu in the marinade for 20
minutes. With large spatula, remove tofu. Gently squeeze out excess
liquid by pressing tofu between fingertips. Set aside. To make dip,
combine soft tofu, 1/2 c water, and 2 Tb soy sauce in blender or food
processor; pour this batter onto large flat plate. Place whole-wheat
flour in a second flat plate and cornmeal on a third. Dredge each
slice of marinated tofu first in flour, then in batter, and last in
cornmeal. Heat oil to sizzling in large skillet and deep or shallow
fry (as you prefer) each cutlet until both sides are golden brown.
Drain on paper towels. Serve with dollop of tartar sauce and sprig of
fresh parsley. Note: to freeze tofu, place in plastic bag, seal, and
freeze for a minimum of 48 hours before thawing. The color of frozen
tofu will be a light amber, and when cooked, its texture will be
pleasantly chewy. Makes 6 servings.
