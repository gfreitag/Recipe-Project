Melt butter in a wide frying pan over medium high heat. Add potatoes;
cook, turning occasionally with a spatula, until lightly browned,

and bell pepper over potatoes; cook for about 1 more minute.
Meanwhile in a small bowl, beat eggs, water, hot pepper sauce, lemon

uncooked egg flow underneath; repeat until eggs are done to your
