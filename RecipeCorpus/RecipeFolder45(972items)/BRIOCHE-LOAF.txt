Title: BRIOCHE LOAF
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 3/4 ts Active dry yeast
1 3/4 c  Bread flour
2 tb Bread flour
3 tb Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
2    Whole eggs
1    Egg yolk
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Water
8 tb Butter, unsalted
Add all ingredients except the butter in the order suggested by
manufacturer and process on the basic bread cycle. Cut the butter into
tablespoon-size pices. About 10 minutes before the end of your first
kneading cycle, begin adding the butter, 1 tablespoon each minute. Do
not rush it. Let the machine continue its process. At the end of the
entire cycle, let the brioche cool in the OPENED machine about 20
minutes. This will keep the sides firm while the center stays moist.
