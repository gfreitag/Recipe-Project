2    Chicken breasts; whole
1/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Butter
2 tb Salad oil
2 tb Onion; minced
1 tb Parsley; minced
1/4 ts Chervil
1/4 c  Bourbon
4 oz Mushrooms; canned
10 oz Tomatoes; canned
1/4 ts Sugar

Split chicken breasts in half; place in a paper bag with flour,
paprika, and salt.  Shake bag well to coat chicken thoroughly, remove
from bag, and shake off excess flour. In a heavy saucepan melt the
butter. Add the salad oil and saute the chicken until light brown on
both sides. While sauteing, add onion, parsley and chervil to pan.
After browning, add bourbon and set aflame for about 10 seconds.  Add
mushrooms - including juice - to the pan. Chop the tomato meat
coarsely and add with juice to the pan. Cover with a tight lid, and
continue to simmer 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If
necessary, remove the lid and continue to cook until the sauce is
medium thick. Skim excess fat from the sauce. Add sugar and salt and
pepper to taste.  Serve with noodles or rice in a casserole.
