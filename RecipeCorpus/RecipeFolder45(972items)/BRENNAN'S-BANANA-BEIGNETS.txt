BEIGNETS:

Mix flour, sugar and baking powder in bowl.  Add milk, beer and
egg and stir until smooth.

Heat oil in deep fryer or heavy deep skillet to 375F. Working in
batches, dip bananas into batter and then carefully add to oil. Cook
until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Pour
caramel sauce onto plates.  Set bananas atop sauce.  Sprinkle with
powdered sugar. Garnish plates with mint leaves and serve.

CARAMEL SAUCE:

Bring cream to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat. Cook
sugar in heavy small saucepan over low heat, swirling pan
occasionally, until brown. Gradually stir hot cream into caramel
(mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil until thickened to sauce
consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bourbon.  Serve hot. (Sauce can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over low heat.)

Makes about 1-1/3 cups.
