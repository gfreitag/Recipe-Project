Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3 ea Eggs
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
2 1/4 c  Milk

With an electric mixer, beat eggs until frothy (about 3 minutes). Add
sugar, nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon, and beat until well blended. In a
sauce, heat the butter and milk until the butter melts (but do not
allow it to boil).  In a large bowl, mix together raisins, pecans and
bread cubes. Combine the milk and egg mixtures, pour this over the
bread and allow it to soak for 45 minutes.  Preheat oven to 350
degrees F. Lightly grease individual ramekins or a large loaf pan.
Add the apple to the bread pudding, and spoon mixture into the baking
container. Place in oven immediately reduce heat 300 degrees F and
bake for 40 minutes. Increase heat to 425 degrees F and bake for
another 15 minutes until nicely browned. To make bourbon sauce,
combine 2 eggs and icing sugar. Melt butter in a double broiler,
whisk in egg mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sugar has
melted and sauce has thickened slightly. Allow to cool, and add
bourbon.  Serve over bread pudding.
