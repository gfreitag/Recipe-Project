Categories: Cajun, Meats
Yield: 18 Inches
3 c  Water
1/2 lb Boneless pork, cubed
1/8 lb Pork liver
1/2 c  Onion, chopped
1/4 c  Green onion, chopped
1 ts Parsley flakes
1 ts Celery flakes
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
3/4 ts Red pepper
3/4 c  Cooked rice
Sausage casing
Place water, boneless pork, and pork liver in a 2-quart saucepan.
Bring mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a medium heat
setting and simmer until pork is tender. Remove pork and liver from
stock. Grind pork and liver (use food processor, if desired). Add
onion, green onion, and other seasonings to stock. Cook until onions
are tender. Add ground meat to vegetable-stock mixture.  Cook until
most of the water has evaporated. Stir in cooked rice. Adjust
seasonings, if desired. Stuff rice-meat mixture into sausage casings.
Prick casings 3-4 times each to prevent bursting during cooking. Cook
boudin in simmering water for 12 minutes. Remove from water and serve.
