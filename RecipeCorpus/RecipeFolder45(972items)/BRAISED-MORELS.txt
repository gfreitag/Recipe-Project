This recipe is good on either pasta or rice. Or, you can fill small
pie shells with the mixture. WIPE MORELS CLEAN. Cut larger ones in
quarters, leave smaller ones whole. Bring 4 quarts of cold, salted
water to a boil over high heat on the stove. Melt the butter in a
medium skillet over medium heat and add the morels, garlic, shallots
and salt. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the sherry and brandy.
Increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid reduces by about
2/3. Add the cream and cook until the liquid reduces to a saucelike
consistency and is thick enough to coat a spoon. Remove from the heat
and keep in a warm place until the pasta is finished cooking. Add the
pasta to the boiling water, cook until desired doneness, drain and
toss with the mushrooms. Place on a serving platter or in a large
serving bowl and serve immediately. Can be prepared up to an hour in
advance to this point and kept, covered, in the pan. TO FREEZE
MUSHROOMS AND SAUCE, fill an airtight plastic freezer bag 3/4 full
and squeeze out excess air. Label and place in freezer for up to 3
months. Defrost at room temperature or on the defrost setting of a
microwave.
