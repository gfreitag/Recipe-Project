Line a 9" pie pan with pastry dough and brush it with 1 tablespoon
melted butter.  Bake at 425 just until dough begins to color (5-8
minutes). Pat half the rice on bottom and sides of crust. Add salmon
in an even layer and sprinkle it with the nutmeg-flavored lemon
juice. Add egg slices and season to taste with salt and pepper. Top
this with remaining rice and pour over all the 1/4 cup butter-chive
mixture.

Adjust top crust; flute edges, vent crust and paint it with Egg
Glaze. Bake at 400 about 35 minutes.  If crust browns too quickly,
cover top loosely with foil. Add a light sprinkling of onion salt
just before serving and garnish with sprigs of parsley lightly dipped
in paprika.

Cut in wedge size servings and serve with a fresh spinach salad and
croissants.
