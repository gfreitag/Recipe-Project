Thoroughly cream shortening, sugar and salt. Stir in egg, molasses

hrs. On lightly floured surface roll to 1/8" thickness. Cut with
cookie cutter.
Place 1" apart on greased cookie sheet. Make eyes and buttons with
raisins. Bake in moderate (375 deg.) oven for about 6 minutes. Cool
slightly and remove from sheet. Allow to finish cooling on wire racks.

reduce the baking time by a minute or so.
