Title: GHANA SHRIMP: SHRIMP WITH GHANA SAUCE
Categories: Sauces and, Fish & shel
Yield: 2 Servings
12 md Cooked shrimp -- shelled
1 ts Red pepper -- paste, as
Follows
~Ghana Red Pepper Paste
1/4 c  Dry red wine
1 ts Ground red pepper (Cayenne)
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1/8 ts Ground cardamom
1/8 ts Ground coriander
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1/8 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Onion powder
1 ts Garlic -- powder
1/4 c  Paprika
If using frozen, thaw, wash, and dry the shrimp. Remove shells. Place
the measure of Ghana Sauce in a glass bowl; add shrimp and toss to
coat well. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Heat the
WOK; spray with a little oil; add the shrimp and cook till hot; no
more than 5 minutes. Serve at once with a black bean salad, like
Texas Caviar (or Crowder Bean salsa). Steamed rice is nice.

Place all ingredients except the paprika in a small glass bowl. Stir
well. Heat paprika in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat 1 minute,
stirring constantly.  Gradually stir in the spice mixture until the
paste is smooth. Heat about 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until
hot. Cool for a dipping sauce.  Cool for a marinade. Freeze for
future use.

Alternative: Heat paprika, cumin and ground coriander in a dry pan
over low to medium-low heat to "toast" and renew the dried spices.
Remove from the heat and transfer to a 1-cup pyrex measure for
further blending. Add the other spices to the pan. Stirring
constantly, add the wine and make a paste. I have stored the paste in
a space jar for 2 months. Might last longer in a zip-lock bag that
can be "burped" or if we didn't use it up in other recipes calling
for a sweet-hot sauce.
