1-inch thick.  For a decorative presentation you might want to cut
notched grooves 1 inch apart on the top of each slice to suggest the
grooves of a scallop shell. 2. In a small bowl, combine the nuts,
brown sugar and salt. Add the butter and stir until well blended. 3.
Place the pineapple slices on a baking sheet lined with foil.
Sprinkle with a few tablespoons of the nut mixture or arrange in a
graphic pattern over each pineapple slice. 4. Broil the pineapple
slices about 6 inches from the heat until the filling starts to
caramelize, about 1
1/2    minutes.  Serve hot.
