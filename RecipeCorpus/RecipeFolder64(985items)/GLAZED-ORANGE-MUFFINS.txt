1/3 c  Fresh Orange Juice
1/3 c  Sugar
Preheat the oven to 400Ã¸F. Spray 12 muffin cups with vegetable cooking
spray or line with paper liners. In a large mixing bowl, combine the
flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Grate the zest of the orange
and juice it. Add enough milk to the orange juice to measure 1 cup
plus 2 tb and pour it into a second bowl. Add the butter, egg,
vanilla, and baking soda and whisk until blended. Add the wet
ingredients to the dry and combine with as few strokes as possible.
Fold in the orange zest and pecans.

Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each one 1/2
to 2/3 full. Bake until golden and fragrant, 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the orange glaze: In a small pan, bring the orange
zest and juice and sugar to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.
Turn down the heat and let simmer until thickened, 4-5 minutes. Let
cool slightly. The glaze should be liquidy so that it soaks into the
muffins. Let muffins cool 2-3 minutes, then brush the tops with the
warm glaze, or drip it over them with a spoon. Serve warm. Sticky and
good -- real good!
