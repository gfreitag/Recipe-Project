** NOTE: Butternut squash can be difficult to cut, because the pulp
is very firm and the outer skin is slightly tough, so work carefully.
I find that the easiest way to work with it is to cut the squash in
half crosswise at the base of large neck.  Then carefully cut in half
lengthwise. Scoop out any seeds in the cavity and slice the halves
into 1/2 inch lengths crosswise.  Peel the skin from each piece and
then cut into dice. 1. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large,
heavy pot. Add onions, garlic and red peppers. Cook for 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have wilted.  Add the
chili powder, cumin, allspice, oregano and red pepper flakes; cook
for 1 minute longer, stirring to coat vegetables well with spices. 2.
Add the chopped tomatoes with their juices, red wine, diced butternut
squash and orange zest. Bring all ingredients to a boil, reduce heat
to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until squash
is tender. Add salt and pepper to taste, and adjust seasonings. 3.
Add the kidney beans and fold in gently. Cook 10 minutes more. Just
before serving, stir in the chopped cilantro and parsley.
