Title: GLUTEN-FREE MOCK RYE BREAD (FOR BREAD MACHINE
Categories: Breads, Breadmakers, Gluten free
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
1/2 c  Rice bran
1/2 c  Tapioca flour
1/2 c  Potato starch flour
1 tb Xanthan (or guar) gum
1 tb Caraway seeds
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Dry milk (non-instant)
1 tb Cocoa powder
1 ts Grated orange peel
2 ts Yeast
2    Eggs
3 tb Oil
1 tb Fruit sweet
2 tb Molasses
1 1/2 c  Water
2 tb Water
1 ts Vinegar
Follow directions for your particular bread machine. Use single rise
setting.

I wrap the bread in a towel for about 4 hours after it is done baking
and then slice it thinly with an electric knife. It freezes well. I
take individual slices of bread out the the freezer and then
microwave about 30 seconds per slice.

This bread is wonderful!  Many of my non-celiac guests request this
over homemade whole wheat bread.
