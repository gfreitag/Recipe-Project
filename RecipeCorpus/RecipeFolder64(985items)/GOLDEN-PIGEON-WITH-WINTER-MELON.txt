I used Cornish Game Hens, but you could also use a cut up chicken. If
you can't get winter melon, watermelon will work. Winter melon is
white, very mild tasting and a tad denser than watermelon. I think
you could get away using something like Honeydew too.  Have fun!

Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Poultry

"Happy Bird Crosses The Golden Bridge" presents an attractive image
featuring the pigeon, a symbol of happiness to the Chinese. The
inclusion of winter melon, a summertime seasonal vegetable, as the
imagined "golden bridge" is a culinary play on words: the dish
combines two traditional dishes providing a bridge between their
contrasting textures and flavours. The garnish - flowering chives -
is more than an aesthetic detail, symbolizing the greenery growing
along the water's edge.

To prepare:

1.  Mix the marinade and coat pigeons with it for 2 to
3    minutes.

2.  Remove skin of winter melon and cut 12 slices about 5 cms wide,

3 cms long and 2 cms thick.  Make a slit sideways on the longest side
of each piece and insert one ham slice.

To cook:

1.  Deep-fry pigeons over a medium flame until golden.

2.  Heat the wok or pot, add 1 tbs oil.  When it is very hot, stir-
fry ginger and shallots for 1 minute. Then add above stewing seasoning
ingredients and pigeons, cover and braise over a slow flame for 20 to
25    minutes.  Remove pigeons.

3.  Reserve 1 cup of the pigeon braising stock, to make sauce later.

4.  Double the remaining braising stock's liquid volume by adding
water, then immerse winter melon slices. Cook for 5 minutes, then
turn off heat. Cover wok, leave winter melon slices for a further 5
minutes (thus ensuring they do not lose their shape through excess
direct cooking).

5.  Mix sauce ingredients with reserved cup of pigeon braising stock
and heat.

To present:

1.  Cut pigeons into pieces and arrange across serving dish.

2.  Place 6 overlapping winter melon slices on each side of pigeons.

3.  Pour sauce over, and garnish with flowering chives.

Makes 12 servings.
