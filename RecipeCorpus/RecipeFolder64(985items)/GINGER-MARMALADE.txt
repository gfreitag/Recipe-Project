Yield: 24 Servings
5    Seville oranges
1 1/2 c  ;Water
3 oz Fruit pectin
1/8 ts Soda
5 c  Sugar
8 oz Preserved ginger; chopped
Cut oranges into quarters; peel. Slice off any white pith from the
peel then slice the rind very fine. Put the rind, water, and soda in
a saucepan. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 20
minutes.

Meanwhile, discard all white pith and seeds from the orange sections
then chop the fruit. Add fruit pulp and juice to the saucepan and
simmer for another 10 minutes.

Take 3 cups of the cooked mixture and pour into another large sauce-
pan. Add the sugar and mix thoroughly then bring to a boil for 1
minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in the pectin.
Skim off the foam and fold in the ginger. This makes about 4 1/2
pounds.
