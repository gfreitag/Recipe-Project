Title: GL#HWEIN
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 6 Servings
1 ga Wine, red (vin ordinaire)
8 fl Brandy/vodka
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Lemon juice
1 pn Cardamom
6    Cinnamon stick
6 sl Lemon; 5mm thick
1    Bay leaf
Chuck all ingredients in large pot EXCEPT for the sugar. Cover, simmer
gently for 10 mins, taste.  Now add 2 teaspoons of sugar per person
(level, NOT heaped). Simmer for 10 mins.

Place lemon slices in glass mugs and ladle the concoction into
glasses. The lemon must float. If not, discard lemon and cut new
slices. The secret is to drink the hot mixture through the lemon; it
gives a very distinctive flavour.

CAUTION:  DO NOT ALLOW THE MIXTURE TO BOIL!!!! After all, you
wouldn't want all that alcohol to evaporate, would you?
