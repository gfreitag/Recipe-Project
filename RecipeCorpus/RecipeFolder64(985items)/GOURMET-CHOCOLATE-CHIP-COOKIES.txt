Notes:

*  This recipe is adapted from one that was in _Gourmet_ magazine
almost 15 years ago.  (I've NEVER used the coriander.) The original
recipe also said to drop by 1/3 C measures and THEN chill the dough.
I just didn't have room in the fridge  ;->  And the cookies are still
huge when I use the 1/4 Cup to spoon 'em out...

*  Will use approximately 16 oz. of nuts and 18 oz. of chips.
