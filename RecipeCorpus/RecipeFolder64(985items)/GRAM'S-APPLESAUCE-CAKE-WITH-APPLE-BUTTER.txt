An attraction presentation is to slice the chilled applesauce cake
thinly, spread with apple butter, and make little sandwiches.

Cake ~--- Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves,
nutmeg, and salt, and set aside.

Cream the butter until soft and fluffy and add the sugar gradually,
beating until the mixture is light. Alternately add the dry
ingredients and the warm applesauce, blending well after each
addition. Mix in the raisins and nuts.

Pour into 3 small (6 x 3 1/2") loaf pans and bake in a preheated 350
F oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until done. Cool in the pans for 15
minutes. Remove, wrap, and chill before slicing. Serve with apple
butter.

Apple Butter ~----------- Combine the applesauce, sugar, cinnamon,
allspice, ginger, and cloves in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and
simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Cool and spread on slices
of Applesauce Cake.
