My grandma never made these muffins, but she could have, relates John
T. Ham, Jr., of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "They're good, old-fashioned
grandma quality.  Serve them any time of the year, but take along
some for a breakfast picnic.  Or wait till a picnic draws close and
bring them out as an end-of-the-day treat."  At least four
generations of John's clan have rated Devil's Backbone State Park
near Strawberry Point, Iowa, their top picnic spot.

1.  In a large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, baking
powder,
2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking soda, and cloves. Stir in apple and
walnuts.

2.  Combine eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter.  Add flour to the
mixture.  Stir till just combined.  Spoon batter into greased
muffin
cups or pans lined with paper bake cups.

3.  For Streusel topping, in a small bowl, stir together the 1/2 cup
flour, the brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Stir in softened
butter.  Sprinkle over batter in muffin cups.
