2 1/4 lb Carrots; small
1 bn Celery
4 x  Green peppers; or any other
-color, red, yellow etc
1 lg Cauliflower
2 1/2 lb Onions; small white, peeled
-these are pearl onions
1 c  Salt

1/2 ga White vinegar
1/4 c  Mustard seed
2 tb Celery seed
3    Chiles; dried, or more
-subst. powder, 3 Tb approx

18 oz Sugar; or slightly less
Peel carrots, cut in half lengthwise then into 1 1/2 inch pieces. Cut
celery into similar sized pieces. Remove seeds from Peppers and cut
into 1 3/4 inch strips. Break the cauliflower into flower heads.
Dissolve the salt in cold water. Place the vegetables in this brine
to cover, leave overnight. After 12-18 hours drain the vegetables,
rinse in cold water, and allow to drain again. Select jars with glass
or enameled lids. Wash and rinse well, then dry in a warm oven. A
single large jar works fine. In a large glass or stainless steel pan
combine vinegar, mustard seed, celery seed, chiles and sugar. Boil
for 3 minutes and then add the carrots and onions and boil for 5
minutes. Fill the warmed jars with hot vegetables and top up with
vinegar to within a half inch of the rim. Close lids firmly. This
goes into a 3 1/2 to 4 quart jar, and looks as good as it tastes.
