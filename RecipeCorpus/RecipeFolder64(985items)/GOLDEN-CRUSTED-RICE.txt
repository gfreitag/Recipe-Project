Title: GOLDEN CRUSTED RICE
Categories: Rice
Yield: 8 Servings
4 c  Long-grain white rice
6 c  Cold water
2 tb Salt
3 tb Margarine
3 tb Water
1 bn Fresh parsley
~ In fine strainer, rinse rice well under running cold water. - Place
rice, the 6 cups water and the salt in 3- to 4-quart saucepan with
nonstick finish. Bring to boil over medium heat; boil 15 minutes or
just until rice is cooked but still firm. Turn rice into fine
strainer; rinse with cold water just until steaming stops. - Wash
saucepan well to remove starch residue. Heat margarine and the 3
tablespoons water in saucepan over medium heat until mixture bubbles.
Reduce heat to low; spoon rice into pan, spreading bottom layer
evenly and pressing down gently. Surround rim of pan with folded
paper towels, leaving very slight overhang (this insures tight fit of
lid). - Cover, weighting down lid if needed to keep steam from
escaping. Cook over low heat 1 hour: unmold immediately or let stand
up to 1 hour (rice will stay hot and fluffy). To unmold, uncover pan,
invert serving platter over pan, then turn platter and pan together.
Gently lift off pan. - Use whole parsley to ring (give appearance of
a bed of parsley) and chopped as garnish.
