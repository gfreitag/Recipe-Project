Categories: Desserts, Ice cream
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 c  Instant non-fat dry milk
10    Graham crackers
4    Eggs
7/8 c  Honey
3 c  Milk
4 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Vanilla
Crush or grind 5 of the graham crackers into a powder (works great in
a food processor).  Pour graham cracker powder into large bowl. Add
non-fat dry milk powder, mix well. Then add 1 cup of the milk, and
beat into a thick soup.  Add the eggs and honey and thoroughly mix or
beat, again into a thick liquid (honey added at room temp.). Now add
remaining 2 cups of milk and all the cream.  Mix well.  Add the
vanilla last with a short additional mixing. Chill the mix in the
refrigerator for several hours (up to 24) before freezing in ice
cream maker. In the last few minutes of churning and freezing the ice
cream, add the remaining 5 graham crackers after breaking them into
small chunks (by hand). Yield: approx. 3 quarts.
