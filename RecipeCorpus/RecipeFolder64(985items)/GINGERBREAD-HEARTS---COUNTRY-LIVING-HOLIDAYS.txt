Title: GINGERBREAD HEARTS - COUNTRY LIVING HOLIDAYS
Categories: Holidays, Cookies
Yield: 60 Cookies
4 1/2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 ts Ground ginger
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Vegetable shortening
3/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Light molasses
1 lg Egg
About 14 yards 1/4 or 1/8
-inch-wide red ribbon (opt.)
1. In medium-size bowl, combine flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and
salt.

2. In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed, beat
shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in molasses and
egg. With mixer on low speed, beat in flour mixture to make a stiff
dough. Shape dough into 3 equal balls; wrap and set aside until ready
to roll out.

3. Heat oven to 350'F. Lightly grease and flour 2 baking sheets.
Between 2 pieces of floured waxed paper, roll out one ball of dough
to about 1/4-inch thickness. Remove top piece of paper. With 3 inch
heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out as many hearts as possible and
place about 1/2-inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Press together
dough trimmings and reroll to cut out more hearts. If making cookies
for ornaments, pierce a small hole with a drinking straw about 1/2
inch from center top of each cookie.

4. Bake gingerbread hearts 12 to 15 minutes or until firm and golden
brown. While still warm, check holes and reopen, if necessary. Cool
gingerbread on wire racks. Repeat rolling, cutting, and baking until
all dough has been used. If desired, thread an 8-inch piece of ribbon
through the hole of each and tie. Hang cookie hearts on tree, or
store in airtight containers to serve later.
