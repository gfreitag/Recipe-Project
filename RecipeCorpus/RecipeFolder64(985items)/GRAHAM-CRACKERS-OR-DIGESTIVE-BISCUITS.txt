Title: GRAHAM CRACKERS OR DIGESTIVE BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 kg (4 cups) whole wheat flour
250 g  (1 cup) butter
250 g  (1 cup) dark brown sugar
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cream of tartar
1    Lightly beaten egg
125 ml (1/2 cup) hot water
Cut butter into flour until mixture is like coarse meal. Add all other
ingredients, but only enough water to make dough into pastry
consistency. Roll out on a floured surface till very thin (about 3 mm
[1/8"] to 6 mm [1/4"] thick). Cut into small squares, depending on
what size you prefer. Bake on *unoiled* baking sheets until golden
brown, about 15 minutes. Cool on rack.

Yield: 2 dozen. These crackers are very popular in the US for babies,
but I have never seen them in the UK. They are delicious spread with
cream cheese and apricot preserves--or strawberry, or red currant
jelly, etc.
