FOR SALTY DOUGH: To make wrapper: Bring a pot of water to a rolling
boil for several minutes. Meanwhile, combine the first 4 ingredients.
Now, measure the amount of water needed and return that to a boil and
immediately pour the boiling water over the dry ingredients. Mix well
and knead on floured board for 3 or 4 minutes. FOR SWEET DOUGH: To
make wrapper: Mix the first 2 ingredients in a bowl. Dissolve brown
sugar in water and bring to a rolling boil. Immediately add water to
flour mixture and stir until dough is firm. Knead lightly for a few
minutes until dough is well mixed. COMMENTS: This dough is usually
deep fried with meat or sweet fillings. The texture is most
interesting because the wrappers become soft and chewy on the inside
and crunchy and crispy on the outside. Yield: 2 1/2 to 3 doz.
