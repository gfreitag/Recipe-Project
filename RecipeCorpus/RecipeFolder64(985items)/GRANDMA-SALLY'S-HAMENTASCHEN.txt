Title: GRANDMA SALLY'S HAMENTASCHEN
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 1/4 c  Melted shortening
1 c  Sugar
3    Eggs, beaten
1    Grated lemon (whole fruit,
-not just peel)
4 c  Flour (scant), sifted with:
1 ts Salt
3 ts Baking powder
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
Fills 1/2 of dough recipe:
2 lb Partly cooked pitted prunes
6 tb Jelly/Jam
1 c  Raisins
1    Orange or 1/2 lemon
1 c  Nuts
Shake of cinnamon
Combine the dough ingredients to form dough. Grind the filling
ingredients together with a food grinder.

Roll out the dough and cut circles with a glass. Put a spoonful of
filling in the center of each circle, and fold up sides of the dough
to form triangular filled cookies.

Bake at 400 F until lightly browned.

I haven't actually made this recipe, but I've been enjoying the
hamentaschen for years. For poppyseed filling, I think I'd just use
the solo filling from th can. I've made my own hamentaschen using
various jams for filling, with some success. Good luck.
