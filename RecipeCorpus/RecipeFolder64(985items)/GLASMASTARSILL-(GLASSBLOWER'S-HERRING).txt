Bring the vinegar, water and sugar to boil in a 1 to 1-1/2 quart

sugar completely dissolves. Then remove the pan from the heat and let
the pickling liquid cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, wash the
herring in cold running water and cut them into 1" thick pices.
Arrange a thin layer of onions in a 1-quart glass jar (a Mason jar,
if possible) equipped with a tightly fitting cover. Top with a few
slices of herring, carrots, giner root and horse-radish and scatter
with allspice, mustard seeds and bay leaf. Repeat until all of the
ingredients have been used, making 3 or 4 layers. Pour the cool
pickling liquid into the jar; it should just cover the contents.
Close the jar securely and refrigerate it for 2 or 3 days. Serve as
an appetizer or as part of the smrgsbord.
