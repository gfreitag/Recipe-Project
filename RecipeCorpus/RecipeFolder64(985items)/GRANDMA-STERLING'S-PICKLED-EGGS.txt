Categories: Relishes, Eggs
Yield: 1 Servings
6 ea Beets
Eggs, as many as desired
MMMMM--------------------BEET PICKLING LIQUOR-------------------------
1 c  Vinegar, Cider
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Pickling Spices
Wash and boil 6 fresh beets. After cooking the skins will slip off
easily. Cut beets into 1/4 or 1/8's. Reserve 1/2 cup of the liquid
the beets were cooked in.

Hard boil as many eggs as desired...warning they go fast, so a dozen
won't last long, two dozen is better...depends on the size of the jar
you must put them in.

Peel using the `shake the pan' method, and while still warm place in
a jar with the beets and the 1/2 cup of the reserved beet juice and
cover with the warm liquor.

(Beet liquor directions) Heat the vinegar and sugar until sugar is
dissolved. Add pickling spices. Pour over eggs and beets in a glass
jar. Let sit until room temperature, then refrigerate.

ENJOY!
