Title: GINGER SAUCE FOR STEAMED CRAB
Categories: Chinese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Live Dungeness crab
1/2 c  Chopped fresh ginger
1/2 c  Mild vinegar
1/3 c  Light soy sauce
1/3 c  Sugar, or to taste
Now that it's crab season, try this Eastern Chinese dipping sauce,
loaded with fresh ginger and vinegar.

Put the live crab in a steamer over rapidly boiling water; cover and
steam for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix the remaining ingredients thoroughly until the sugar
dissolves.

Divide sauce among 2 to 4 dip bowls, depending on the number of
diners. Serve with the steamed crab.

NOTE:  Chopped fresh coriander may be added, if desired.
