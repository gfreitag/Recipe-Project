Cookie dough:

Blend all ingredients together until you can shape the dough into a
smooth ball. Let stand 20 minutes, loosely covered. Form dough into
marble-sized balls. Place 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheets.
Flatten each with a smooth bottom of a drinking glass greased once
and dipped into Nestle's Quik Powder. Bake at 400 for 8 minutes.
Remove at once from baking sheet, to paper toweling, and immediately
flatten each cookie with a smooth spatula. Let cool 20 minutes.

Cookie filling:

Soften gelatin in cold water. Place in heat-proof cup in pan of hot
water until gelatin is transparent. Meanwhile, beat Crisco until
fluffy, adding vanilla and sugar a little at a time. Beat in gelatin
mixture when it is completely cooled, but not set or firm. When
cooled, shape filling into 1-inch balls. Place between the two bottom
sides of the cooled cookies, and press gently until the filling has
spread to the edge.
