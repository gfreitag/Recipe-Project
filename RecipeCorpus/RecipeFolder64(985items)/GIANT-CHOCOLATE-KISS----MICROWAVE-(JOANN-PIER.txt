Title: GIANT CHOCOLATE KISS -- MICROWAVE (JOANN PIER
Categories: Candies, Microwave
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Powdered sugar
1/2 c  Cocoa
1/2 c  Butter (no imitation)
1/4 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts (optional)
Combine sugar, cocoa, butter, and milk in a 2 qt. casserole.
Microwave on HIGH 2 minutes.  Add vanilla and walnuts. Stir, pour
into a generously buttered large funnel (rubber band a piece of foil
over spout of funnel) making sure you fill the spout end. Place
funnel in a tumbler and set in freezer or frig until set. When set
carefully unmold and wrap with foil creating a big "kiss". You can
add a streamer with your own sentiments if desired.

NOTE:  If desired, you can make smaller kisses by using the small
funnels which are used to fill perfume bottles. These make the
regular "kiss" size chocolates.  These funnels can be purchased in
many cosmetic departments at variety stores, department stores and
gadget stores.
