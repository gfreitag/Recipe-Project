Title: GHEE (INDIAN BUTTER OIL)
Categories: India, Condiments
Yield: 3 Cups
2 lb Butter, unsalted
Divide butter into 1/4 pound pieces. In heavy 5 qt. saucepan, heat
butter over moderate heat, stirring to melt slowly and completely
without letting it brown. When completely melted, increase heat and
bring the butter to a boil.
When the surface is completely covered with white foam, stir the
butter gently and reduce heat to the lowest possible point. Simmer
uncovered and undisturbed for 45 minutes, or until the milk solids on
the bottom of the pan are golden brown and the butter on top is
transparent.
Slowly pour the ghee through a linen towel or 4 layers of moistened
cheesecloth. If the are any solids, no matter how small, strain again
to prevent oil from becoming rancid later. The ghee must be perfectly
clear.
Pour the ghee into a jar or crock, cover tightly and store in
refrigerator or at room temperature until ready to use. Ghee will
solidify when it is chilled. If may be safely kept at room
temperature for 2 or 3 months.

NOTES: Although ghee resembles clarified butter, the long low heat
cooking imparts a distinctive nutlike flavor that cannot be
duplicated.
