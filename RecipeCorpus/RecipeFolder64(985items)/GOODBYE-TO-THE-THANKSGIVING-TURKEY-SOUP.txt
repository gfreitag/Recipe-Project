Title: GOODBYE-TO-THE-THANKSGIVING-TURKEY SOUP
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
Meaty turkey carcass and
lg Bones
2    Carrots -- thinly sliced
1    Stalk celery -- sliced
1    Onion -- cut in eighths
1    Bay leaf
2    Parsley sprigs
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1/8 ts Dried thyme
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Peppercorns -- whole
9 c  Water
1/2 c  Celery -- thinly sliced
2 c  Chicken broth -- if needed
1/2 c  Shell pasta
1/2 c  Frozen peas -- thawed
1. Break up turkey carcass and place bones in a 5- to 6-quart Dutch
oven or deep kettle. Add 1 of the carrots, the stalk of celery,
onion, bay leaf, parsley, nutmeg, thyme, salt, pepper, and water.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and sirmmer, covered, 3 hours. Uncover
and simmer 1 hour longer to reduce liquid.

2. Strain into large bowl. Discard bones and vegetables, returning
any meat to the broth. (At this point, soup may be refrigerated, then
skimmed.)

3. Return soup to the cooking pot. Add the second carrot, sliced
celery, and additional broth, if needed to enhance flavor. Bring to a
boil again, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until carrots and
celery are tender (about 1 hour).

4. Add macaroni and cook at a gentle boil until nearly tender--about
10 minutes. Stir in peas and continue cooking about 3 minutes. Salt
to taste.
