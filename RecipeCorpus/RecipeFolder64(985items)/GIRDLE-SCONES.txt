*Canadian all purpose flour is very hard; the American equilvant is
bread flour This recipes comes from the town of Fergus, Ontario,
founded by two Scots in the 1880s. A girdle is a large cast iron pan.

Heat flat cast iron pan on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until
hot. (To test, sprinkle with a little flour; if it browns in 10 to 15
seconds, the pan is hot enough.) Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl,
stir flour, baking powder, salt and sugar; with fingertips, rub in
shortening or lard till crumbly. Whisk egg with 1 cup of the milk.
Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients; pour in the liquid.
With wooden spoon, stir to make soft, but not sticky dough, adding
more milk as needed. Turn out onto floured board, knead 3 or 4 times.
Pat or roll to no more than 1/4 - 1/2 inch. With sharp knife, cut
into small triangles. Place a few at a time on pan; cook, rotating
scones occasionally for 5 to 6 minutes or until bottoms are browned.
Serve hot. MAKES: approx 2 DOZEN
