Title: GLUEHWEIN  (HOT SPICED WINE)
Categories: Beverages, German
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM----------------DONAULAND KOCHBUCH; KOFRANEK---------------------
1 c  White or red wine
5    Sugar cubes, or to taste
1    Whole clove
1 sm Piece lemon peel
-a little stick cinnamon
Combine all ingredients and heat, barely to boiling point. Pour into a
pre-warmed glass, wrap glass in a napkin, and serve immediately.

[Note:  We did this one for a Christmas party one time and used a
crockpot to keep it at the right temperature. Worked just fine - but
it's best then to put the spices in a cheesecloth bag (or some such)
as they must be removed, else the whole thing eventually turns
bitter. K.B.]
