FILLING

Boil potatoes and whole onion until potatoes are fully cooked.  Drain
potatoes, discard onion and mash.  Saute chopped onion in butter until
tender, but not browned.  Combine mashed potatoes, cheese and onion
and mix well. Allow to cool before filling perogi

PEROGIS

Combine ingredients, except for oil and 1/2 tsp salt, and mix together
until mixture forms a ball.  Cover and let stand at room temperature
for 30 minutes.  Roll dough to about 1/8-in thick.  Cut in circles
approx. 3 in. in diameter.  Place filling on half the circle, fold
over and press edges together well, slightly dampening the edges with
water to help make a seal if necessary.   Fill a large saucepan 3/4
full with water, add the oil and salt and bring to a boil.  With the
water boiling, cook pirogis uncovered for about 5 minutes until they
rise to the surface of the water, stirring occasionally with a wooden
spoon to keep from sticking. Remove with slotted spoon.  To finish,
saute in a frying pan with butter and chopped green onions for 2
minutes. Garnish with sour cream and a dash of paprika.

Serves 2 dozen.
