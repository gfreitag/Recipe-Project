Nothing, absolutely nothing, was as delectable as these cookies that
my grandmother taunted us with.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large bowl, combine brown sugar and butter; mix well. Beat egg
and add to creamed mixture; mix well. Add cocoa and mix.

In a separate bowl, measure flour and baking soda. Add dry
ingredients alternately with milk to egg and cocoa mixture. Stir in
vanilla and chopped nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a cookie sheet
and bake at 350ø for 10-12 minutes. Remove to wire racks and let cool.

While cookies are baking, make icing by combining all ingredients.
Thin with a little milk if icing is too thick.

When cookies have cooled, frost with chocolate icing.
