Categories: Dips
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Bitter oranges
2    Lemons
1 oz Root ginger
140 fl Water
8 oz Preserved ginger, chopped
7 lb Granulated sugar
(The "8 servings" listinng above should be ignored.... This recipe
makes about 10 pounds of marmalade.)  Wash and halve the bitter
oranges and lemons.  Squeeze out the juice and seeds. Strain the
juice into a bowl and tie the pulp, seeds and root ginger together in
a piece of muslin or doubled/tripled cheesecloth.  Shred peel to the
desired thickness and put peel and juice in a pan with the water and
the bag of pulp and seeds. Simmer gently for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or
until the peel is quite soft. Remove the bag of pulp (squeeze over
the pan as you do) and add the preserved ginger. Measure liquid, add
sugar and stir over low heat until dissolved. Boil rapidly to setting
point:  then can as usual.
