Title: GOOD FOR WHAT AILS YA CHILI
Categories: Chili
Yield: 6 Servings
1/3 c  Olive Oil
3 lb Lean Ground Steak
2 x  Onions, peel & finely chop
3 cl Garlic, peel & finely chop
Salt
4 c  Boiling Water
1 ts Caraway Seeds
2 ts Sesame Seeds
1/2 ts Oregano
4 tb Chili Powder
1 c  Pitted Green Olives
2 cn Kidney Beans (1 lb cans)
(drained and well rinsed)
1) Chop the steak into 1 inch cubes. Heat the oil and beef a few
cubes at
a time, turning to brown on all sides. Add the chopped onions and
saute
over medium heat for 2 or 3 minutes then add the garlic.

2) Season with salt to taste. Add the boiling water, caraway and
sesame
seeds and oregano. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour.

3) Gradually stir in the chili powder, testing frequently until you
achieve the degree of flavour and hotness that suits you. Add
olives,
cover and simmer for another hour.

4) Taste, and correct the seasoning then mix in kidney beans and heat
through.

Toasted french bread, tortillas or corn bread go well with this and a
crisp green salad.

Hints: =====

Beer is the only drink that can stand up to the spiciness of the
chili.

Cool and freeze in containers. Serving day heat over low heat.
