This gingery cookie is crisp and has a hint of orange flavor. It is
ideal for gingerbread people or holiday cookie shapes.

In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda and spices. In a
medium bowl, cream butter and sugar together, then add egg, molasses,
salt and orange rind. Mix well. Stir into dry ingredients. Form dough
into a ball shape. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill overnight.

Preheat oven to 375ø. Roll out to 1/4-inch thick on floured surface.
Cut into desired shapes. Place shapes unto ungreased cookie sheets
and bake at 375ø for 8-10 minutes until lightly browned around edges.
Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Note: Dough will keep up to one week, refrigerated. Cookies can be
stored up to 3 weeks in cookie tins.

Variation: Decorate cookies with raisins, colored sugar, silver
dots, etc. before cooking. Or ice them after they have cooled.
