Carciofi Dorati E Fritti To quote the author, "The reason why these
fried artichokes are called dorati (golden) is that they are dipped
in beaten eggs before frying...eggs from chickens raised on farms
have yolks of a much richer color than the eggs on finds in the
market today, and food dipped in eggs acquire a golden color...The
best artichokes for this dish are the very best fresh and tender ones
which have no choke at all and require only a very short cooking
time." Prepare artichokes as directed in "How to clean artichokes -
Jewish styles"."Cut in half lengthwise and cut each half into 3
wedges,; keep them in this acidulated water (lemon water) for no
longer than 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Dredge
with flour and shake to remove excess. Beat the eggs yolks together.
Heat the oil in a small frying pan. Dip artichokes in beaten egg and
fry, a few at a time, in moderately hot oil till lightly browned on
all sides. Sprinkle with salt, garnish with lemon wedges, and serve
immediately.
