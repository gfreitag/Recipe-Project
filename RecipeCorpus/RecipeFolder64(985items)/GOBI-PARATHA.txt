Title: GOBI PARATHA
Categories: Vegetarian, Indian, Punjabi, Breads
Yield: 1 Batch
3 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Finely grated cauliflower
-OR- steamed cabbage
2 tb Ghee
1 bn Sliced coriander leaves
- ("1 handful")
3    Green chilies; minced
1 ea 1/2" piece ginger; minced
1 tb Mango powder
A few sliced mint leaves
Salt
Chili powder
Mix together salt and flour.  Rub in ghee, then add enough water to
make a stiff dough.  Mix together the rest of the ingredients. Divide
the dough in lemon-sized balls.  Then roll out each ball into a not
too thin disc or a chapati on a floured board.  Spread the
cauliflower mixture on one round chapati and cover with another round
chapati. Seal the edges nicely, sprinkle a little dry flour on top,
then roll out the paratha as thinly and as roundly as you can, being
careful not to break it. Grease a smoking tava or a girdle [Uhhh...I
think they mean a "griddle" -KM] with ghee and place the paratha over
it.  When the undersize [sic] turns a little golden coloured, apply
ghee on the top and turn over. Press gently and cover this side also
with some ghee.  Keep turning and applying a little ghee until the
paratha turns golden coloured. Serve it piping hot with a tablespoon
of butter and a bowl of seasoned curds.
