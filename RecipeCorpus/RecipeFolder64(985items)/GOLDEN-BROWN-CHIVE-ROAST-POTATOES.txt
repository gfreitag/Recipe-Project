Title: GOLDEN BROWN CHIVE ROAST POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes, Jane
Yield: 6 Servings
6 lg Potatoes
1/4 c  Butter, melted
1/2 ts Salt
4 ts Chives, chopped
1/2 c  Parmesan
3 tb Bread crumbs
Preheat oven to 350.  Peel potatoes and place in cold water. Then dry
thoroughly and a thin slice off the long side of each potato so it
can sit flat.  With a sharp knife, cut vertical slits from the top
almost to the bottom of each potato.  Dip cut potatoes in melted
butter and sprinkle with salt.  Bake on a foil covered baking sheet
for 1 1/2 hours basting with the remaining butter.  In the last 15
minutes, combine the chives, cheese and crumbs and stuff them into
the slits in the potatoes, to form a topping.
