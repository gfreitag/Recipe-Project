Title: GLAZED ROAST CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Whole chicken
1    Lemon
2 tb Margarine
2    Garlic cloves -- Minced
Apple ginger chutney *
1. Remove giblets from inside roasting chicken and reserve for other
uses. Wash and pat dry chicken. Place an apple and an onion
(quartered) inside chicken if you prefer. Tie wings and legs in place
with twine or unwaxed dental floss. Place chicken on rack in a
roasting pan. Rub the skin with a lemon half and then brush with
melted margarine. Unsalted butter is best if you prefer. 2. Combine
1/2 cup chutney and garlic in a small bowl. Brush chicken with this
mixture. 3. Roast in 375-degree oven for 70-80 minutes. Baste the
chicken frequently with the chutney and juices in the pan. Meat
thermometer should register 190 degrees when done. Leg will move
easily and feel very soft when pressed. Serve roast chicken warm or
at room temperature. Delicious as leftovers for sandwiches.
Substitute turkey breast for the chicken if preferred.
