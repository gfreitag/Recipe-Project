Title: GOAT CHEESE SOUFFLE
Categories: New import
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 tb Butter plus enough to coat
Dish
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
1 c  Milk
Bouquet garni (1 bay leaf;
6 Sprigs thyme, 2 thin
Onion slices)
3 tb Flour
Salt, pepper and cayenne
4    Eggs separated plus 2
Additional egg whites
1 c  Crumbled goat cheese
Butter a 9x13-inch glass baking dish and coat with Parmesan cheese.
Preheat oven to 400 F. Heat the milk with the bouquet garni until it
boils; set aside to steep for 15 minutes, then strain.

Melt 2 1/2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. When foamy, stir in
flour and cook over medium heat, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in
the milk all at once and stir vigorously for a minute or so as it
thickens. Then add salt, a few twists of pepper and a dash of
cayenne. When it has cooled slightly, beat the egg yolks into the
souffle base until well blended, then stir in the cheese. (Leave a
few lumps.)

Beat the 6 egg whites with a pinch of salt just until they form nice
peaks. Stir a quarter of the whites into the souffle mixture to
lighten it. Fold in the remaining whites, transfer to prepared dish,
place in the oven and lower heat to 375 F. Bake 30 minutes or until
golden and just a bit wobbly in the center. Remove and serve
immediately. Makes 4 servings.
