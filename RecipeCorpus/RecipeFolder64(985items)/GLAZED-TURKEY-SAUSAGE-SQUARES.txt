Title: GLAZED TURKEY SAUSAGE SQUARES
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Beaten egg
2 ts Salt
2 ts Dry mustard
2 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Ground allspice
3/4 ts Pepper
1 lg Fine chopped onion
2 cl Garlic, minced/pressed
1/2 c  Fine dry bread crumbs
2 lb Ground turkey
3/4 lb Bulk pork sausage
1/3 c  Apple jelly
1/3 c  Chutney finely chopped
1/3 c  Raisins
In a large bowl, mix eggs, salt, mustard, coriander, allspice, pepper,
onion and garlic; blend in bread crumbs, turkey and sausage. Press
meat mixture into an ungreased 10 x 13 inch rimmed baking pan. Bake
in a 425 degree oven for 20-30 minutes or until firm and browned at
edges. Let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Holding meat, tip pan
to drain off fat. In a small pan over medium heat, melt jelly with
chutney; spread over meat. Cut into 1 inch squares, top each with a
raisin, and serve warm. If made ahead, cover lightly and refrigerate
for up to 2 days; or freeze for up to a month. Reheat meat squares
(thaw, if frozen), uncovered, in a 400 degree oven for about 8
minutes or just until hot.
