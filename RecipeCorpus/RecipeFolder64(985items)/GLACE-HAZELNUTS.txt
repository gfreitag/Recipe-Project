Title: GLACE HAZELNUTS
Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 Recipe
3/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
1 ts Light corn syrup
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
3/4 c  Oregon hazelnuts
Coat 2 sheets of wax paper heavily with butter and set aside. In a
small saucepan, combine sugar, water and corn syrup. Stir over medium
heat until sugar dissolves and mixture boils. Cover for 2 to 3
minutes, then uncover and stir in hazelnuts. Continue cooking without
stirring until mixture begins to turn a rich brown. Immediately pour
hazelnut mixture into a sieve held over one sheet of buttered paper.
Quickly shake sieve several times to drain excess syrup from
hazelnuts, then turn hazelnuts out onto remaining sheet of buttered
paper. Quickly separate hazelnuts with a fork. Cool. Lift from paper
and store in covered container. Use for garnishing cakes or other
desserts, add to a cookie assortment or serve as candy.
