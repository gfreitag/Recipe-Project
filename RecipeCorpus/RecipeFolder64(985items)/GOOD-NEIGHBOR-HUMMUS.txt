Note: In her column notes, Colombo mentions that chili paste can be
purchased at Oriental food markets.  This recipe makes no mention of
chili paste, although it was an ingredient in the Good Neighbor
Szechuan noodles. Seeing as how I think Good Neighbor may have "held
back" a little bit on this recipe (they wouldn't give it out for
years, as it's one of their best sellers), you may also want to
experiment and add a little chili paste to this recipe, which does
have a slight bite to it when purchased at Good Neighbors.

Absolutely great with unsalted blue corn chips! Have eaten many times
but haven't made at home yet.  It's delicious, and sells for
$4.50/lb. at Good Neighbors.

Carol Grady, who wrote: "I am addicted to the wonderful food
available at Louisville's Good Neighbor Foods Co-op Cafe, but I know
I can't ask you to obtain recipes for all of their creations. Let's
start with three of my favorites: hummus, Szechuan noodles and maple
pumpkin pie." Alice Colombo responded: "I have to agree with you -
all are winners." Posted by Cathy Harned.
