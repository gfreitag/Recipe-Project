Recipe by: Creepy Cuisine, Lucy Munroe Heat 2 inches of water to
simmering, not boiling, in the bottom of a double boiler. Place the
white chocolate chips in the smaller pot and set it over the pot of
simmering water. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly until the
chocolate is fully melted. Remove from the heat. Cover 2 cookie
sheets with waxed paper. Arrange the wooden sticks on the waxed
paper, 6 to a sheet. Spoon ghost-shaped blobs of chocolate onto the
paper, partially covering each stick. Press 2 candies into each ghost
for eyes. Freeze ghosts for 15 minutes, or until hard. Penny Halsey
