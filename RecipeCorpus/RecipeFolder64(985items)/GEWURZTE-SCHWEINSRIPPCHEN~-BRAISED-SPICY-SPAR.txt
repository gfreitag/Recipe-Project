Set out a heavy skillet and a roasting pan having a tight fitting

Pour the cooking oil in the heavy skillet.  Add the ribs to the oil
and brown slowly on both sides.  While the meat is browning, prepare
the meat broth.  Add the next 10 (from ketchup to the garlic clove),
ingredients to the broth mixture.

Finely chop the onion.

Put the meat into the roasting pan.  Pour the broth mixture over the
brownrd ribs.  Add the chopped onion. Cover and put in a 350 degree
F. oven for about 1-1/2 hours, or until the ribs are tender.

With a slotted spoon, remove meat from pan to a warm serving platter.
Set aside to keep warm while preparing the sauce.

For Sauce:  If necessary, skim excess fat from cooking liquid. Strain
the liquid and pour into a small saucepan. Mix the 1/4 cup of water
and 2 tablespoons of flour in a screw top jar. Cover jar tightly and
shake until mixture is well blended.

Bring liquid in saucepan to boiling; stirring constantly, slowly pour
1/2 of the flour mixture into the cooking liquid. Bring to boiling.
Gradually add the remaining flour mixture. Bring sauce to boiling
after each addition.  Cook 3 to 5 minutes.

Spoon or pour about 1/2 of the hot sauce over spareibs on the platter.
Serve remaining sauce in a gravy boat if desired.
