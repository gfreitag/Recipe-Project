Title: GODIVA MOCHA FRAPP
Categories: Beverages, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
2 oz Dark roast coffee
6 tb Unsweetened cocoa
6 tb Sugar
1 qt Coffee ice cream
1 1/2 c  Milk
Brew strong coffee using 4 cups cold water. Whisk together the cocoa
and sugar. Whisk in to the hot coffee. Cool then chill. In batches
combine the cold coffee, ice cream and milk in a blender and process
until blended and foamy. Fill 8 to 10 soda glasses with frapp
mixture. Sift cocoa powder over the tops and serve with straws. The
recipe originally called for Godiva Special Roast coffee but I think
it's just a darker roast. This recipe was found at the Godiva
Chocolate site.
