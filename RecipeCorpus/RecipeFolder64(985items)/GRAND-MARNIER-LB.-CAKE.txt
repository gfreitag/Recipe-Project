Categories: Pound, Cakes
Yield: 10 Servings
1 c  2 sticks unsalted butter
1 2/3 c  Sugar
2 c  All purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Grand Marnier liqueur
1 tb Grated orange zest
5 x  Eggs
1 pk 12 oz chocolate minichips
GLAZE:
1/4 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Grand Marnier
1/4 c  Sugar
CAKE:  Peheat the oven to 350F. Generously butter a 10 in (9 cup)
fluted tube pan; then springkle it with flour, tapping out the
excess. Set aside.
In a large bowl with the electric mixer on high speed, beat the
butter until creamy. Gradually beat in the sugar and continue beating
until the mixture is light and fluffy. Turn the mixer speed to low.
Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat just until the flour
is absorbed. Beat in the Grand Marnier and orange zest. Beat in the
eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add
mini-chips. Spread the batter in the prepared pan, smoothing the top
even. Bake until the cake shrinks from the side of the pan and a
skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 1 hour and 5
minutes.  Let stand in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then
carefully unmold the cake onto a second rack placed over a pieve of
wax paper or aluminum foil.

GLAZE: Meanwhile, combine the orange juice, Grand Marnier, and sugar
in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower the
heat and simmer until the mixture forms a light syrup, about 5
minutes. Then brush the syrup all over the warm cake. When it is
cool, transfer it to a serving plate.
