Most people think of Trinidad, Guyana, and Martinique when they think
of East Indian influences on Caribbean cooking. Jamaica, however, has
had its share of that influence as well, as proved by this chutney
that is prepared from bananas and ginger. Makes about 3 1/2 cups.
Place the onions, bananas, dates, and vinegar in a nonreactive
saucepan. Stir them to mix well and cook over low heat for 20
minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir to make sure they are
well combined. Continue to cook until the chutney has a jamlike
consistency. Remove from the heat and place in sterilized jars. This
chutney can accompany cold meats, grilled meats and, of course,
curries. It will keep for 3 weeks in the refrigerator.
