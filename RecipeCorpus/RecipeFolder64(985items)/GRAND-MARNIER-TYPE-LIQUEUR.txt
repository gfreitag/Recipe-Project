Title: GRAND MARNIER TYPE LIQUEUR
Categories: Liqueurs
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  80 proof vodka
4    Oranges, juice and zest
3 c  White sugar
1 tb Corriander seed
3 oz Imitation brandy flavor
Brown food dye
Cut or scrape the orange colored part off the orange peel. This is
the zest and is quite rich in aromatic essences. Be careful not to
get any of the white pith of the peel since it is very bitter.
Squeeze the oranges and strain the juice well. In a mixing jar place
the orange juice, zest, vodka and the corriander seed. Cover and
leave to infuse for two weeks. Drain thru a coarse sieve and return
to the mixing jar. Discard the residue. Add the brandy flavor and the
sugar. Shake vigorously until the sugar is dissolved. Leave to clear.
This liqueur is very slow to clear, so be patient. When clear, two
weeks or more, decant and add brown food dye previously mixed with a
small amount of the liqueur. This liqueur should be a pale brown
color so go very easy with the brown food coloring, lest you end up
with a dark brown liqueur.
