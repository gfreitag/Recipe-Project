The Story:

According to the tradition, the cake was left outside in the cold for
2 days before being served. This recipe was, therefore, a winter
speciality.

The Recipe:

Cream the butter and sugar thoroughly.

Add the cinnamon, salt, kirsch and 2/3 of the eggs. Beat thoroughly.

Slowly incorporate the flour. Sprinkle the yeast into the milk and
add this to the mixture. Finally, add the sultanas and water. Mix
thoroughly until a smooth paste is obtained.

Pour into a buttered and floured cake tin and leave to prove in a warm
place for about 1 hour.

Brush the cake with beaten egg and bake in the oven at 180 oC for
about 40 minutes .

Leave the cake to cool then wrap in aluminium foil or greaseproof
paper and store in a refrigerator for 2 days before serving.
