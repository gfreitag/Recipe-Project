Title: GLOSSARY OF TERMS (M-Z)
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Half  Microorganisms - Independent organisms of microscopic size, including
bacteria, yeast, and mold. When alive in a suitable environment, they
grow rapidly and may divide or reproduce every 10 to 30 minutes.
Therefore, they reach high populations very quickly. Undesirable
microorganisms cause disease and food spoilage. Microorganisms are
sometimes intentionally added to ferment foods, make antibiotics, and
for other reasons.

Mold - A fungus-type microorganism whose growth on food is usually
visible and colorful. Molds may grow on many foods, including acid
foods like jams and jellies and canned fruits. Recommended heat
processing and sealing practices prevent their growth on these foods.

Mycotoxins - Toxins produced by the growth of some molds on foods.

Open - Kettle canning A non-recommended canning method. Food is
supposedly adequately heat processed in a covered kettle, and then
filled hot and sealed in sterile jars. Foods canned this way have low
vacuums or too much air, which permits rapid loss of quality in
foods. Moreover these foods often spoil because they become
recontaminated while the jars are being filled.

Pasteurization - Heating of a specific food enough to destroy the most
heat-resistant pathogenic or disease-causing microorganism known to be
associated with that food.

pH - A measure of acidity or alkalinity. Values range from 0 to 14. A
food is neutral when its pH is 7.0: lower values are increasingly
more acidic; higher values are increasingly more alkaline.

Pickling - The practice of adding enough vinegar or lemon juice to a
low-acid food to lower its pH to 4.6 or lower. Properly pickled foods
may be safely heat processed in boiling water.

Pressure canner - A specifically designed metal kettle with a
lockable lid used for heat processing low-acid food. These canners
have jar racks, one or more safety devices, systems for exhausting
air, and a way to measure or control pressure. Canners with 20- to
21-quart capacity are common. The minimum volume of canner that can
be used is 16-quart capacity, which will contain 7 quart jars. Use of
pressure saucepans with less than 16-quart capacities is not
recommended.

Raw pack - The practice of filling jars with raw, unheated food.
Acceptable for canning low-acid foods, but allows more rapid quality
losses in acid foods heat processed in boiling water.

Spice bag - A closeable fabric bag used to extract spice flavors in a
pickling solution.

Style of pack - Form of canned food, such as whole, sliced, piece,
juice, or sauce. The term may also be used to reveal whether food is
filled raw or hot into jars.

Vacuum - The state of negative pressure. Reflects how thoroughly air
is removed from within a jar of processed food--the higher the
vacuum, the less air left in the jar.

Yeasts - A group of microorganisms which reproduce by budding. They
are used in fermenting some foods and in leavening breads.
