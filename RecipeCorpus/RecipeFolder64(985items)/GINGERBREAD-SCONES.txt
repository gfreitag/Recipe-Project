FOR THE SCONES: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown
sugar, baking powder, ground ginger, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.
Using a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center. In a small mixing bowl,
stir together the egg yolk, molasses, and milk; add all at once to
the center of the flour mixture. With a fork, stir until combined
(mixture may seem dry). Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.
Quickly knead dough for 10-12 strokes or until nearly smooth. Pat of
lightly roll dough into a 7" circle. Cut into 8 wedges. Arrange
wedges on an ungreased baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Brush with
egg white and sprinkle with coarse sugar if desired. Bake at 400F for
12-15 minutes or till lightly brown. Cool scones on a wire rack for
20 minutes. Serve warm with Nutmeg Whipped Cream if desired. To
freeze: Cool scones completely and wrap tightly in foil; place in
freezer bags. Freeze for up to 3 months. Place frozen, foil-wrapped
scones in a 300F oven and heat for 15-20 minutes or until warm (10-15
minutes if thawed). FOR THE NUTMEG WHIPPED CREAM: In a chilled small
mixer bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Beat with chilled beaters
of an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. Serve
immediately or cover and chill until needed, up to 2 hours. Makes 1
cup.
