Jars
In addition to "fabric hats", etc., you can always paint the outside
of the jar. *Sketch a simple design; fit around the jar until plesed
with the arrangement. Tape, design-side-out, to inside of jar.
*Following the pattern, paint with oil paints on the outside of the
jar. Let dry. *Remove taped pattern from inside of jar. *Bake jars 1
hour in 200 degree oven to set paint. *Turn off oven but leave jars
inside for a couple of hours to finish setting paint. Fill with food.
Decorate lid as desired (e. g., fabric hats, doily with ribbon
blending with colors in paint, et cetra. Hope that this helps.
