Categories: Chinese, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 1/2 lb To 3 pounds fresh rhubarb
4    Lumps "ginger in syrup" *
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Cornstarch
Vanilla ice cream
CRUMB TOPPING:
1 c  Flour
1 c  Sugar
1 pn Salt
3/4 c  Chilled unsalted butter, cut
-into small pieces
* or crystallized ginger, each about 3/4 inch in diameter

Preheat oven to 375'.

Rinse the rhubarb and pat dry. Trim off all the leaves and roots (they
contain oxalic acid, which is toxic). Cut stalks into 1 inch pieces
and place in a large bowl.

Coarsely chop the ginger and mix with the rhubarb.

Sift together the sugar and the cornstarch; toss with the rhubarb.
Transfer to a 2 1/2-quart shallow baking dish. Set aside.

The topping: Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor;
pulse a few times to mix. Add the chilled butter and process until
the mixture turns crumbly, just a few seconds. Sprinkle the crumb
topping over the rhubarb. Bake until the topping turns golden brown
and the rhubarb is bubbling.

Serve warm with scoops of vanilla ice cream.
