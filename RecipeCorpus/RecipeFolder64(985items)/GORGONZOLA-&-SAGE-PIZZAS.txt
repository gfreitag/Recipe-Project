Categories: Appetizers, Italian/tus, Main dishes, Vegetarian, Pizza
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Pizza Dough Martha Stewart
Cornmeal for dusting
6 oz Dolce Gorgonzola, cut in
sm Pieces
24    Fresh sage leaves
Heat oven to 450#161#F. Heat a pizza stone in oven for at least 30
mintues, or preheat a large baking sheet for 15 minutes. Place discs
of dough on a lightly floured surface and gently roll out or stretch
into 1/4-inch thick circles 7 inches in diameter.

Place one circle of dough on a wooden peel that has been dusted with
cornmeal (or use a large spatula). Using the tine of a fork, pierce
the surface of the dough numerous times. Arrange about an eighth of
the cheese on the dough.

Slide dough onto hot pizza stone or baking sheet and bake until crust
is just starting to brown around the edges, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove pizza from oven and arrange another eighth of the cheese and 6
sage leaves on top. Return to oven and cook until crust is golden
brown and cheese is bubbling, about 3 more minutes. Cut pizza into
six pieces and serve immediately. Repeat process three times with
remaining dough, Gorgonzola, and sage.
