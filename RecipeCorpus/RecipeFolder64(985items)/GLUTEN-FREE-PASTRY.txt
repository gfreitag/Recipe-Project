Categories: Allergy, Diabetic, Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Whole bean flour (try puree)

1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Vegetable shortening

Bean flour is a new product being promoted by the Ontario Coloured
Bean Growers of Ontario.  If not available to you, try white bean
puree. Less fat is required with bean flour than whole wheat flour
for pastry.

Stir together dry ingredients, then cut in shortening until mixture is
crumbly using pastry blender or 2 knives. Try adding puree
alternately with shortening.

Whisk together egg white and a little less water if using bean puree.
Stir into dry ingredients to make a soft dough. Divide dough in half.
Roll dough out to 1/8" thickness on a cornstarch dusted surface,
between layers of waxed paper or layers of plastic wrap. Press into
pan, patching if necessary.

For pie shell or single crust: Trim edge leaving half-inch overhang
to tuck under and flute edge. Line inside of pastry shell with piece
of foil. Bake at 400 F for 15 minutes or until edges are golden
brown, remove foil.

For double-crust pie: Trim edge, fill, roll top pastry. Tuck 1/2 inch
overhang under edge of bottom crust, press firmly together. Flue
edges. Cut steam vents. Bake as recipe directs for filling.

Makes 1 double-crust, 2 single pie shells or 24 medium tart shells.
