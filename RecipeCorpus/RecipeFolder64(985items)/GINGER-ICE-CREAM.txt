* Magee said she'd probably use more.

In pan, simmer 1/2 c. water, 1/3 c. sugar and fresh ginger for 3-4
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Set aside to cool 5 minutes. (This
is called a simple syrup.)

In another pan, scald milk and cream (don't boil). Remove from heat
and stir in remaining sugar and the syrup. Set aside 15 minutes to
allow flavors blend.

Strain ginger solids from milk mixture. Whisk in egg yolks and
crystallized ginger.  Return to heat (use either a double boiler or
heat diffuser.) Heat gently, stirring constantly, until it becomes a
thin custard. Don't allow it to simmer or boil. It should coat the
back of a spoon.

Cool mixture and freeze according to your machine's instructions.
