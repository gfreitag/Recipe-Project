Title: GIRARDET'S LYONNAISE POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 4 Servings
500 g  New potatoes; 1 lb 2 oz
100 g  Onions; 3 1/2 oz
2 tb Oil
Salt
Pepper
Note - This dish is simple enough as long as your frying pan is very
large, the oil is very hot and the potatoes are cooked in one layer
only.

Preparation

Peel the potatoes and slice them finely - 2mm (1/16 in) thick - with a
mandoline. A food processor will do as well, as long as the slices are
thin.

Peel the onions. Slice them finely too, and separate the rings in each
slice.

Finishing

Heat the oil in a large frying pan.

Season the potatoes and onions.

Put the slices of potato into the pan first and saute them quickly,
turning them over several times, for 2 minutes. Add the onions and
continue cooking, still stirring and turning, for 3-4 minutes more,
until both potatoes and onions are crisp and golden.
