Title: GOBHI SAMOSA (CAULIFLOWER PASTRY)
Categories: Appetizers, Indian, Snacks, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Samosas
Ghee, as necessary
1 ts White cumin seeds
1 tb Onion, chopped
4 tb Cauliflower, grated
1 tb Green peas
1 pn Asafetida
1 ts Green mango powder
1 pn Garam masala
1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
1/2 ts Cayenne
1 ea Recipe pastry dough
Water to bind
Heat 1 tb ghee in a skillet.  Saute the cumin seeds until golden. Add
onion, cauliflower & peas & mix well. Mix in asafetida & mango powder,
stir.  Add garam masala, salt & cayenne. Cover the pan & cook over a
moderate heat for 10 minutes.  Remove pan from heat & cool. Divide
mixture into 8 equal portions. Take one half-moon of pastry & brush
the edges with water.  Fold into a cone.  Fill pastry with 1 portion
of cauliflower mixture & seal the top. Repeat with the rest of the
pastry. Heat sufficient ghee (or vegetable oil) in a wok or large
skillet to deep fry 4 samosas at a time.  When very hot, deep-fry
each samosa for a few minutes, until golden brown, flipping once to
cook both sides. Drain on paper towels. **MARK'S NOTE:  To avoid
excess fat I like to deep-fry the samosas, drain them very well &
then reheat them in a toaster oven at 350F for 5 minutes or so.  If
you place them on a grill while re-heating them, extra oil can also
drain off.
