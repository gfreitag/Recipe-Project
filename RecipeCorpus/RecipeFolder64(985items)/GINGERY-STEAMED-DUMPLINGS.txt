Title: GINGERY STEAMED DUMPLINGS
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Garden Sausage (Wholesome &
Hearty Foods, INc.>
Fresh hot-tasting powdered
Ginger
x  Kikkoman lite soy sauce
1 pk Won ton wrappers
x  A few Chinese style pea
Pods
Warm 4 patties at a time in the microwave for about 30 seconds, which
is hopefully time enough to thaw them but not make them too hot to
handle. Lay out several won ton wrappers, then put a little wad of
the Garden Sausage (I got about 6 dumplings per patty) in the center
of each wrapper. Sprinkle with ginger and soy sauce. I put a little
slice of pea pod in about 1/2 of the dumplings just to make it more
interesting.

Pinch the won ton wrappers closed at the top.  Put as many as will
fit side by side into a steamer basket in a sauce pan (at least
that's how I did it because the rice steamer was occupado) with a
little boiling water in the bottom.  Cover and steam for 5+ minutes.
The won ton wrappers I used came covered in a little flour and I
figured that when the wrappers looked moist rather than floury they
were done.

Serve with little dishes of hot Asian-style mustard and /or light soy
sauce.
