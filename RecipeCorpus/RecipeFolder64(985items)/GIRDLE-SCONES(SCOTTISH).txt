Title: GIRDLE SCONES(SCOTTISH)
Categories: Cakes, Scottish
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Flour
1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 oz Butter
1 ts Golden syrup
Buttermilk, Or
Full cream milk OR
Sour milk
Tip:- To test for the correct heat of the girdle sprinkle it with a
little flour. If the flour browns at once it is too hot; it should
take a few seconds to turn colour.

Sift the flour into a bowl. Add the other dry ingredients and mix.
Rub in the butter. Add the syrup and sufficient milk and mix with a
palette knife to a soft consistency. Turn On to a floured surface and
roll quickly and lightly (handle as little as posible) to about 1/4
inch thick. Cut in rounds. Grease and heat the gridle and, with a
slice or broad knife, turn once until brown on both sides. Serve
freshly baked, spread with butter.
