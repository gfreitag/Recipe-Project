Title: COURGETTES PROVENALE
Categories: Vegetables, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
450 g  Courgettes; coarsely grated
Olive oil for frying
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
4 tb Parsley, chopped
3 tb Crotons (see below)
Salt and pepper
MMMMM--------------------------CROTONS-------------------------------
Thin slices of bread
-(day-old, not fresh)
Vegetable oil for frying
Grated courgettes make a delicious dish tossed in olive oil with
garlic and parsley. Topped with crunchy crotons, all this needs to
complement it is some fresh bread and a crisp side salad.

Toss the grated courgettes in the olive oil until just tender and very
lightly browned. Add the garlic and parsley and heat through. Season
with salt and pepper. Cook for a further 1-2 minutes and serve at
once, sprinkled with crotons.

To make the crotons, cut the crusts off the bread and cut the slices
into tiny cubes. Heat the oil in a frying-pan - put in a generous
amount since the bread soaks it up liberally! Toss the bread dice in
the oil, turning until they are golden all over, and crisp. Remove
from the pan with a slotted spoon, and dry on paper towels.

For garlic crotons add a little crushed garlic to the oil before
frying.

For special occasions, try cutting the bread into different shapes:
heart-shaped or tiny triangles, for example.
