Salt and pepper the roast, set it on a rack in a roasting pan and
roast at 325 degrees for 2-1/2 to 3 hours-- or until a meat
thermometer shows 175 degrees at the center of the roast.

Meanwhile mix the canned sauce, onion, orange juice and spices in a

using a little of the sauce to baste the meat every 15 minutes or so.
Serve the remaining sauce with the roast sliced thin.
