1 pk Active dry yeast

3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour

1 ts Salt

1/4 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
All-purpose flour
Makes 2 1/2 dozen rolls

Combine water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve
yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Blend in cream and
egg yolks.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure 2 cups of the flour, butter,
4 tablespoons of the sugar and salt into work bowl. Process on/off 5
or 6 times until butter is size of kidney beans.

Transfer flour-butter mixture to a large mixing bowl. Stir in
remaining 1 1/2 cups flour.

Add cream mixture to flour mixture.  Stir just enough to moisten
flour. (Dough should be crumbly like a biscuit dough, not smooth and
satiny like most yeast doughs.) Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate 12 to 24 hours.

Turn dough onto well floured surface.  Cut dough into 4 equal parts.
Roll each part into a rectangle 6x12 inches. Cut each rectangle into
12 strips 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Shape into knots, circles,
figure 8's, spirals, braids or ovals as desired. Place on greased
cookie sheets. Let rise in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Prepare Almond Icing.  Mix remaining 2
tablespoons sugar with cinnamon.  Bake rolls until evenly brown,
about 15 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet, dip in Almond Icing, then
in cinnamon mixture or nuts.  Cool on wire rack.

ALMOND ICING: 1 1/3 cups sifted powdered sugar 2 Tbsp milk 1 Tbsp hot
water 1/2  tsp almond extract

Blend ingredients until smooth.
