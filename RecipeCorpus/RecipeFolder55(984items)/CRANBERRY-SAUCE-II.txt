Title: CRANBERRY SAUCE II
Categories: Sauces, Fruits
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Bag (12 oz?) cranberries
2 ea Med. apples, pared and chopp
1 c  Orange juice
1 ds Ground cloves
Combine all, bring to a boil, stirring.  Cook over medium heat
stirring constantly, about 8 mins - berries will `pop' and sauce will
thicken. Chill. If you want it sweeter, you might want to try apple
juice instead of orange juice.  We also like it with a handfil of
chopped nuts - pecans preferrably, with walnuts a second choice. I
have also thrown coconut (unsweetened) in it - although others liked
it, we weren't that crazy about it. We eat cranberry sauce year
around. I buy 15 - 20 bags during the holidays and pop them in the
freezer for later use. Cook 'em frozen. They are great in
bread/muffins, too.
