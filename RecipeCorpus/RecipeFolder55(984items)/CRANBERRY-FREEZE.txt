Title: CRANBERRY FREEZE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Chopped cranberries
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
8 1/2 oz Can crushed pineapple
8 oz Cream cheese, softened
1 c  Whipped cream
Drain pineapple.  Blend all ingredients except whipped cream
together. Fold in whipped cream.  Chill, or freeze if you like.

I use a 16 oz carton of nondairy whipped topping instead of 1 cup of
whipped cream.
