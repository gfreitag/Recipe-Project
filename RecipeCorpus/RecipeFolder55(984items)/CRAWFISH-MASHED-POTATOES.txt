Categories: New, Text, Import 	ess, Of, Emeril
2 lb white potatoes, -- peeled,
diced
Yield: 4 Servings
:
4 TB butter
1 lb crawfish tails, -- cooked
1 ts minced garlic
1 TB chopped chives
Salt and white pepper
:
1/2 c  to 1 cup heavy cream

Place the potatoes in a pot and cover with water. Season the water
with salt. Bring the potatoes up to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
Simmer the potatoes until fork tender, about 8-10 minutes. Remove
from the heat and drain. Place the drained potatoes back in the pot
and return to the heat. Cook the potatoes for 2 minutes, stirring
constantly, to dehydrate the potatoes. In a saute pan, melt the
butter. Saute the potatoes in the melted butter for 2 minutes. Stir
in the garlic and chives. Season the crawfish with Essence. Using a
hand-held masher, mash the potatoes with the remaining butter. Fold
in the crawfish and continue mashing. Add in enough cream to the
desired texture. Season the mashed potatoes with salt and white
pepper. Spoon the two sauces on the bottom of the plate. Using a
knife, swirl the 2 sauces together. Mound the potatoes in the center
of the sauce. Lay the fish directly on top of the potatoes. Garnish
with the fried herb salad, parsley, and peppers.

Yield: 4 serving
