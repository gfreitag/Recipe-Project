Title: CRANBERRY PUNCH
Categories: Diabetic, Beverages, Fruits
Yield: 16 Servings
1 lb Cranberries
Water as needed
6 oz Can frozen orange juice conc
2 tb Granul. artificial sweetener
Wash cranberries, removing stems and soft berries. Cook according to
package instructions until berries are soft.

My Note: 2 Tbsp. regular sugar would add 96 calories and 24.8 gm
carbohydrate to the total recipe (6 calories, 1.55 gm carbohyrate per
serving.)  Add while cranberries are cooking if desired and omit
sweetener.

Chop berries in blender or put through food mill.  Add 2 cups water.
Strain through cheesecloth or several thicknesses of nylon net.

Add orange juice concentrate and sweetener (if using). Dilute with
enough water to make 8 cups.  (6 cups printed in the book would not
make 16 servings.)

1/2 cup serving - 32 calories made with sweetener, 1/2 fruit exchange
.4 gm protein, 0.1 gm fat, 7.9 gm carbohydrate, .4 mg sodium, 105.8
mg potassium.
