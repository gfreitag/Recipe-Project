Title: COUNTRY-STYLE GREENS
Categories: Creole, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 6 Servings
2 bn Fresh collard, turnip, or
-mustard greens
1 tb Lard or rendered bacon fat
1 md Onion, minced
1/4 lb Smoked slab bacon or ham *
2 c  Water
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper, to taste
ds Of Louisiana-style hot sauce
* cut in 1/2-inch dices or 1/2 pound ordinary sliced bacon or ham

Contrary to rumor, greens do not need hours of boiling in a sea of
liquid, as this Mississippi recipe proves. What they do need,
however, is the flavor of smoked slab bacon or ham; if you must
substitute ordinary bacon or ham, you'll need twice as much.  Greens
are the traditional accompaniment to pork or ham; they also pair up
well with corn bread or candied yams.

1.  Trim away and discard the tough stems of greens. To loosen grit,
place the leaves and the remaining tender stems (you should have
about 2 quarts) in a large bowl, cover with lukewarm water, and soak
for 5 minutes. Rinse several times in lukewarm water to wash away any
remaining sand.

2.  Melt lard in a large, heavy, nonreactive pot with a lid. (Do not
use an aluminum pot; if possible, use one with an enamel coating.)
Add onions and bacon. Fry together over medium-high heat, stirring
often, until onions wilt and bacon starts to brown (about 5 minutes).

3.  Add greens and the water and bring to a boil over high heat.
Cover, lower heat to medium, and cook until greens are tender, with
just a little crunch (about 20 minutes).

4.  Uncover, raise heat to high, and boil off some of the excess water
(about 5 minutes).  Add salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste, and
serve hot (dish should be slightly soupy).

Serves 6.
