Title: CRANBERRY HONEY MUSTARD
Categories: Mustard, Condiments
Yield: 3 Cups
3/4 c  Yellow mustard seeds
1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
1 1/4 c  Dried cranberries (available
-in health-food and gourmet
-stores
3 tb Honey
1 ts Salt
As the dried cranberries soak with the mustard and vinegar, their
bright red color leaches out into the vinegar. The resulting mustard
is a pretty, cranberry-tinted pink.

In a non-aluminum pot or jar, combine the mustard seeds, vinegar and
cranberries; cover and soak for 48 hours, adding additional vinegar if
necessary to maintain enough liquid to cover the seeds.

Scrape the soaked seed-and-cranberry mixture into a food processor and
process until the mixture turns from liquid and seeds to a creamy
mixture flecked with seeds and bits of cranberry. Add honey and salt.
The process takes at least 3-4 minutes, so be patient. You may need
to add additional vinegar as necessary to create a nice creamy
mustard; keep in mind that it will thicken slightly upon standing.

After about one week of aging, the cranberry flavor seems to settle
into this mustard and make it all the better, but it is perfectly good
immediately. Makes about 3 1/3 cups.
