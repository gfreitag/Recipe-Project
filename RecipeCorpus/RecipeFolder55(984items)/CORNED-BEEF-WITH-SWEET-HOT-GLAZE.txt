1. Rinse meat well with cool water. Place in a 6- to 8-quart pan with
about 3 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high heat; drain. Repeat
this step until the water no longer tastes salty, 1 or 2 more times.
To drained meat, add water (about 2 quarts) to cover it by about
1/2". Bring to boiling on high heat; cover and simmer gently until
meat is very tender when pierced, about 3 1/2 hours.
2. Drain beef; put in a 9x13" pan. (If made ahead, cool, then chill
airtight up until next day. Cover meat tightly with foil; bake in a
350'F. oven until hot in center, about 50 minutes; uncover.)
3. In pan used to simmer beef, mix broth, sugar, and horseradish.
Boil over high heat until glaze is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5
minutes; stir often. (If made ahead, pour into a bowl and cover;
chill up until next day.)
4. Bake hot meat, uncovered, in a 350'F. oven for 20 minutes,
brushing with glaze until all is used. Broil about 6" from heat until
top browns lightly, 3-5 minutes. Put meat on a platter; offer mustard.
