Title: COUSCOUS & GROUND TURKEY
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-==========================
-(serves 4)
Ingredients:

of ground turkey dash(es) of ground allspice dash(es) of
1 lb
ground cinnamon 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped carrots, sliced
lenghtwise, and ~3 in long green onions asparagus butter olive oil 5+
cups prepared couscous

Double Mustard Sauce:

I made this by making up a thick white sauce, replacing about 1/2 the
milk with a grey mustard, and adding mustard powder to taste. I then
adjusted the thickness with milk. Brown the meat, and add spices to
taste.

Steam the veggies, then saute briefly in butter and oil.

I found the timing worked best if I started the couscous and sauce
ahead of time, then did the meat and veggies almost simulatneously,
since they both go fairly quickly.

Serve by putting a bed of couscous on the plate, pour a line of sauce
down the center, and meat over the sauce. The veggies go on either
side of the plate.

I think I ended up using between one and two cups of couscous
(cooked) per serving.  Depends on how hungry you are I guess.
