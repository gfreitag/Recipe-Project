Categories: Breads
Yield: 10 Servings
3 c  Sliced strawberries
2 tb Sugar
1 c  Milk
3    Large eggs
2/3 c  All-purpose flour

=======================================================
==================
Mix strawberries and sugar; set aside. In a blender, whirl milk, eggs,
flour, cornmeal, and vanilla until there are no lumps.
Place a flat-bottom 7-8"-wide frying or crepe pan over medium-high
heat. When pan is hot, add 1/4 teaspoon butter and swirl to coat
surface. Pour in 1/4 cup batter all at once; quickly tilt pan so
batter flows over entire surface (don't worry if there are a few
holes). Cook until surface is dry and edge is lightly browned, about
1 minute. Turn with a spatula and brown other side. Turn out onto a
plate; keep warm. Repeat to cook remainder, stirring batter
thoroughly before cooking each crepe (cornmeal sinks), and stacking
crepes as made.
Spread 1 side of each crepe lightly with jam; fold in quarters. Offer
crepes with berries and yogurt to add to taste.
