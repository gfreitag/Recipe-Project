Title: COUSCOUS SALAD WITH CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Couscous
1 sm Red onion, chopped
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 1/2 c  Boiling water
1/2 c  Sour cream
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Paprika
1 lg Tomato, chopped
1    Bell pepper, chopped
3/4 lb Cubed cooked chicken
Combine couscous, onion, salt, 1/4 tsp paprika, cinnamon, and black
pepper in a saucepan.  Add boiling water. Cover and let stand 5
minutes. Combine sour cream, lemon juice, 1/2 tsp paprika in a large
bowl. Add tomato, green pepper, chicken, and couscous. Serve cold or
at room temperature.

My changes:  I use a can (approx. 14 ounces) of chicken broth instead
of water and boil the onion in the broth before adding to the
couscous (I am not a raw onion fan).
