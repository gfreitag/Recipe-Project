4    Cornish hens
1/4 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Butter; cut into small
-pieces
1/4 c  Cognac or other brandy
1 c  ;water
24    Pitted prunes
1 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
Heat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Twist the wings of each cornish hen
behind its back and tie the legs together. Put the hens breast side
up on a rack in a roasting pan. Sprinkle the hens with 1/2 teaspoon
of the salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Dot with the butter. Roast the hens
until just done, 40 to 50 minutes.

Meanwhile put the cognac, water, and prunes in a small saucepan,
bring to a simmer, cover, remove from the heat, and let steep while
the hens cook.

When the hens are done, transfer them to a large plate and put in a
warm spot.  Pour off the fat from the roasting pan. Set the pan over
moderate heat and add the prune mixture, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon
salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.  Bring to a boil over moderately high
heat, scraping the bottom of the pan to dislodge any brown bits.

Continue boiling until the liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 8
minutes.  Add the parsley.  Remove the strings from the birds. Spoon
the prunes and sauce over the hens.
