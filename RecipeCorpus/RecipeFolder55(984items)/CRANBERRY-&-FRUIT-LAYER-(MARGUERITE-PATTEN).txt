10    Slices of day-old bread
1 1/2 lb Fruit
5 fl Water
Sugar to taste
7 oz Jar cranberry sauce
Cut the crusts off the bread. Prepare and cook the fruit with the
water and sugar to taste. Add the cranberry sauce just before the end
of the cooking period, blend well. Strain the fruit, reserve 5 fl
oz/150 ml ofthe juice. Place a layer of fruit at the bottom of the
basin, add a layer ofbread, then more fiuit with a little juice. Fill
the basin like this, ending with the bread. Place a small saucer and
heavy weight over the top of the pudding and stand for at least 12
hours. Turn out and serve with any fruit juice left and cream or
ice-creaxn or custard.

Variation

The pudding can be made in the more usual way by lining the basin with
bread, filling the cavity with the fruit and a little juice then
covering the filling with more bread. Add the weight and allow to
stand, as left.
