Here are a few tips for baking your own crackers: 1. If you have
cracker dough stored in the freezer, it's like money
in the bank for spur-of-the-moment entertaining. 2. Baking sheets
lined with parchment paper make easy work of
cleanup. 3. Keep an eye on the oven because baking time may vary
with each
batch, depending on the heat and placement of the sheets. 4.
Crackers store well in airtight containers, but last even better
if frozen. 5. Homemade crackers usually are not as crispy as
commercial
varieties.  If they get a little limp hours or days after baking,
revive them by heating in a 275 degree oven. 6. To reheat or crisp
crackers, bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350
degrees for 3-4 minutes.
