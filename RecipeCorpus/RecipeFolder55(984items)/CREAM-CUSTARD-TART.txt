Pulverised dried saffron strands

Shortcrust pastry made with 225 g/8 oz flour, 65 g/2 1/2 oz butter,
40 g/1 1/2 oz lard, and cold water to mix

6 egg yolks 350 ml/12 fl oz/ 1 1/2 cups double cream 125 ml/4 fl oz/
1/2 cup milk 65 g/2 1/2 oz white sugar
1/4    teaspoon sea salt

I first noticed this version of the old recipe in The Babees Book,
and it seemed just right as a sweet dish for the youngsters being
taught from that book.  There is a richer version made with almond
milk for fast days outside Lent.

Soak the saffron in 2 tablespoons water until the water is deep gold
in colour.  Use the pastry to make a case 5 cm/2 inches deep in a
20-cm/8-inch pie plate or cake tin with a loose bottom. Bake 'blind'
in a pre-heated oven at 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 for 15-20 minutes, then
remove the filling of dried beans and return the case to the oven at
about 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 for 6-8 minutes until dried out and firm.
Remember a cake tin is deeper than a pie plate so the case in it may
need longer baking than usual.

Beat the egg yolks lightly in a bowl, then beat in the cream, milk,
sugar, saffron water and salt.  Pour the custard into the pastry
case. Bake it at 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 for about 45 minutes or until
it is just set in the centre.  Serve warm.

Make small tarts if you prefer.  The full recipe quantity of pastry
will make 36 tarts, using a 7.5 cm/3 inch cutter. You will need two
thirds of the filling for them.
