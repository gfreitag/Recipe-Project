Making the batter:  Using a small whisk, combine the flour with eggs
and milk.  Strain through a fine strainer to remove any lumps. Add the
following ingredients: thyme, scallion, parsley and Tabasco. Season
with salt and pepper.  Mix well.

Note:  Batter can be made a few hours in advance up to this point.
Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Just before cooking the crab cakes, add crab meat and baking powder
to the batter, combining gently, using a wooden spoon.

To cook the crab cakes, heat 2 oz. of clarified butter in a large
frying pan, at medium heat.  Using a 2-oz. ladle, make a batch of
three cakes. Fry gently on one side for 2 minutes, turn over and cook
another 2 minutes. Keep cakes warm, while cooking the various batches.

When serving crab cakes, spread 1/4 cup warm beurre blanc on each
plate. Arrange 3 cakes per serving and top off with the julienned
peppers and chives. Sprinkle some capers around the cakes; serve.

Suggested wines:  Farniente Chardonnay.
