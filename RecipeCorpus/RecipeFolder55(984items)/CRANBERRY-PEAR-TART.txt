From "The Family Circle Christmas Treasury."

Combine the water, 3/4 cup sugar and the jelly in a medium-size
saucepan. Place over medium heat until the jelly melts and the sugar
dissolves. Bring to boiling. Add the cranberries and the pear. Cook,
uncovered, over medium heat until the cranberries pop and the mixture
thickens slightly, for 10-15 minutes. Cool completely.

Preheat oven to 375'F. Cut the butter into the flour in a medium-size
bowl with a pastry blender, until crumbly. Mix the 1/4 cup sugar,
walnuts and cinnamon. Add the egg yolks. Mix lightly with a fork just
until the pastry holds together and cleans the side of the bowl.
Press the dough over the botton and up the sides of a 9" tart pan
with a removeable bottom. Prick the bottom with a fork. Refrigerate
for 30 minutes.

Bake the shell in a preheated oven 12-15 minutes, or until golden
brown. Cool completely. Spoon the cooled cranberry filling into the
cooled pastry shell. Reset the oven to 400'F.

Beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar in a medium-size bowl
until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the 1/2 cup sugar until
stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread half the meringue over top of
the tart. Pipe the remaining meringue in a lattice pattern.

Bake in the 400'F. oven for 3-6 minutes, or until the meringue is
golden brown. Decorate with additional cranberries, if desired. Makes
8 servings.
