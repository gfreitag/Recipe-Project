Title: CRAB RANGOON
Categories: Seafood, Appetizers
Yield: 12 Servings
8 oz Cream cheese
6 oz Can crab meat,
1 x  Drained and flaked
2 ea Green onions with tops,
1 x  Thinly sliced
1 ea Clove garlic, minced
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Lite soy sauce
1 pk (48) won ton skins
1 x  Vegetable spray coating
In medium bowl, combine all ingredients except won ton skins and spray
coating; mix until well blended. (To prevent won ton skins from
drying out, prepare one or two rangoon at a time.) Place 1 tsp
filling in center of each won ton skin. Moisten edges with water;
fold in half to form triangle, pressing edges to seal. Pull bottom
corners down and overlap slightly; moisten one corner and press to
seal. Lightly spray baking sheet with vegetable coating. Arrange
rangoon on sheet and lightly spray to coat. Bake in 425 degree oven
for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve hot with sweet-sour
sauce or mustard sauce. Makes 48 appetizers. (The person who gave me
this recipe used to fry the crab rangoon rather than bake it in the
oven.)
