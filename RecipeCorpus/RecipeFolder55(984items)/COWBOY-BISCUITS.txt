Title: COWBOY BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Flour
3 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Lard or shortening
3/4 c  Milk
2 tb Milk
In a mixing bowl, stir the dry ingredients together and cut in lard or
shortening until the mixture has the texture of coarse meal.

Stir in 3/4 cup milk a little at a time until mixture forms a smooth
dough. Turn out onto a floured board and knead lightly. Roll on
floured board to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with a floured 2-inch
biscuit cutter.

Place biscuits on ungreased baking sheet and brush tops with the
remaining milk.  Bake in a 450 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or
until lightly browned.

For drop biscuits, add up to 1 cup milk to the flour mixture. Do not
knead the dough.  Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking
sheet and bake as for rolled biscuits.

Yield: 1 dozen 2-inch biscuits.
