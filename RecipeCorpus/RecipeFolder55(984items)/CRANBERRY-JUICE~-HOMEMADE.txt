Produces 5c juice very rapidly from a small packet of berries.
Cranberries keep virtually forever in the freezer. After extracting
the juice you will have the pulp which needs only sugar and a few
seconds' boiling to become a flavorful coarse-textured cranberry
sauce. The cost of the combined products is very low. Rich in Vit C;
medicinal value.

Wash berries and put into a saucepan with water, orange slices, and
salt. Turn berries, opt orange slices, and liquid into a
cheese-cloth-lined sieve. Strain the juice without pressing and
reserve the berry and orange pulp to make HOME-STYLE CRANBERRY SAUCE.
Return juice to pot with sugar and boil 2-3 mins. Taste, add more
sugar if needed. Cool and chill.
