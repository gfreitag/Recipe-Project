Cranberry Raisin Bread

Serve this bread warm topped with Cranberry Butter (below) on
Christmas morning.

4 cups flour 1.3/4 cups sugar 1 Tablespoon baking powder 1.1/2
teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 cup unsalted butter 2 large
eggs 1.1/2 cups orange juice 1 Tablespoon finely grated orange peel 2
cups fresh cranberries, washed, stemmed and copped (or frozen
cranberries, thawed and patted dry) 1 cup raisins

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine flour,
sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. With a pastry blender or
fork, cut in butter until the mixture makes coarse crumbs. In another
bowl beat eggs, orange juice, and orange peel until well blended.
Stir in flour mixture. Gently fold in cranberries and raisins. Pour
batter into 2 buttered 9-inch x 5-inch-x 3-inch loaf pans and bake
for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center
comes out clean. Cool in pans on rack for 10-15 minutes before
removing from pans.

Cranberry Butter: 1 cup fresh cranberries, washed and stemmed (or
frozen cranberries, thawed and patted dry) 1.1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 1 Tablespoon lemon juice

In a food processor puree the cranberries with the sugar. Add the
butter and lemon juice, and blend until smooth. Transfer to a serving
bowl and chill, covered, until firm
