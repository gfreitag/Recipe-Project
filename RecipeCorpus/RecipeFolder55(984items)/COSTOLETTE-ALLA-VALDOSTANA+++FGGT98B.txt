18TH STREET NW, WASHINGTON, DC BEVERAGE:GATTINARA 1. Slice the cheese
thinly.  Cut a slit into the side of each veal chop to form a pocket.
Stuff the pockets with the cheese. 2. Place the chops on a flat
surface and press the top and bottom together.  Seal the edges by
beating hard with a heavy knife or mallet.  Season lightly with the
salt and pepper. 3. Dredge the chops in the flour, dip in the beaten
egg, and coat with the bread crumbs. Melt the butter in a heavy
skillet or saute pan. Add the chops and saute about 15 minutes or
until golden brown on both sides. 4. Serve piping hot, surrounded by
the lemon wedges and garnished, if desired, with a few parsley
sprigs. Note: For this dish, you must obtain Val d'Aosta fontina. The
Swiss variety will not be the same.
