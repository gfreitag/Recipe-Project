Title: COTECHINO CON LENTICCHIE - FRESH SALAMI WITH
Categories: Italian
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1    Onion, sliced
500 g  Lentils
1 2/3 l  Hot water
2    Cloves garlic
Fresh mint
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Cotechno salami
Olive oil
Cotechino can be found in any good Italian delicatessen. Ideally,
cook it with the lentils. However, like all sausages, it is fatty, so
the instructions that follow are (sigh) healthier.

In a little olive oil, cook 1 onion, sliced, until transpar- ent. Add
500 g Lentils and 1.7 L hot water. Add 2 cloves garlic and some fresh
mint. Cover the pan and simmer gently for about 1 1 1/2 hours or
until the lentils are cooked and little liquid remains. Season with
salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, prick the cotechino in several places with a fine skewer,
put it in a saucepan, cover with cold water and simmer slowly for
about the same time (or follow label instructions). Tip the lentils
into a serving dish, slice the cotechino thickly and arrange on top.
Serve.
