Recipe by: Craig Claiborne - The New New York Times Cook Book 1.
Rinse the clams in several changes of cold water. Drain well. Heat
the butter in a heavy casserole or kettle and add the leeks. Cook for
about 2 minutes, stiring often.  Add the onion and garlic. Cook
briefly, stirring. Add the wine, a little salt (the clams will give
up their liquid, which is salty) and pepper.  Cover and bring to the
boil.  Let simmer for about 5 minutes.

2.  Add the clams, 2 cups of cream, 1 cup of milk and hot pepper and
cover closely.  Let cook for about 10 minutes or until the clams
open. Add the Ricard and stir. Serve piping hot with a soup spoon and
oyster fork.
