Title: CORNMEAL GRIDDLE CAKES
Categories: Breakfast, Side dishes
Yield: 16 Cakes
1 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Plus 3/4C Milk
1 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Butter - melted
2 lg Eggs - slightly beaten
1 ts Oil - optional
Place water, 1 1/4C milk and sugar in heavy bottom medium saucepan and
bring to a simmer. When liquid just comes to a simmer slowly sprinkle
in cornmeal, whisking continuously, so no lumps form. Slowly simmer,
stirring frequently adjusting heat as necessary to prevent
splattering, until cornmeal is cooked and tender, about 4 minutes.
Pour into large bowl to cool to room temperature; stirring
occasionally to prevent skin from forming.
Meanwhile, sift together flour, baking powder and salt in small
bowl. Set aside.
When cornmeal mixture has cooled stir in melted butterr and eggs,
mixing until smooth. Stir in flour mixture. Stir in remaining 3/4C
milk. Batter should be fairly smooth.
Heat griddle over medium heat until water drops splatter. If not
using non-stick griddle brush lightly with oil. For each pancake,
ladle 1/4c batter onto heated griddle and cook until pancakes turn
lightly puffy and a couple of bubbles appear on surface, (this type
of pancake has few bubbles compared to regular ones) and underside is
lightly brown. Turn and cook on other side.

NOTES: Make sure cornmeal is completely cooked. To test, taste small
amount to be sure it is tender and has no crunch to it. You could
also replace half of melted butter with melted strained bacon fat.
