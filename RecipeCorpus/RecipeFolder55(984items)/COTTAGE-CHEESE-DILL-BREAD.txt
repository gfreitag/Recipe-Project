-temperature
1    Egg, beaten
Makes 1 loaf

Vegetable oil or melted butter or margarine

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, sugar and yeast.  Stir to dissolve
yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, onions, butter, dill
weed, salt and soda into work bowl. Process until mixed, about 15
seconds.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

Combine cottage cheese and beaten egg.  Pour evenly over flour
mixture.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water
through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that
cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in just enough remaining
water to make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process
until dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Shape into a ball and place
in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover loosely
with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1
hour.

Punch down dough.  Shape into smooth ball and place on greased cookie
sheet.  Roll or pat dough into a circle about 8 inches in diameter.
Brush with oil and let stand in warm place until almost doubled,
about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until evenly brown, 35 - 45 minutes.

Remove from cookie sheet.  Cool on wire rack.
