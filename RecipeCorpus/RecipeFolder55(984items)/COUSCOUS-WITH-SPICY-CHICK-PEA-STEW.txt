Title: COUSCOUS WITH SPICY CHICK PEA STEW
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 5 Servings
3 c  Couscous
1/4 c  Olive Oil
2    Onions Chopped
3 md Carrots Sliced
2 ts Each Ground Cinnamon,
Ground Cumin,
Ground Coriander
1/2 c  Corn Kernels
1/2 lb Zucchini Diced
1 1/3 c  Dried Chick Peas Cooked
OR
2 cn (14-Oz) chick peas, drained
1 qt Water
1/4 c  Tomato Paste
2 1/2 c  Warm Water
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1.  Spread Couscous Out on a Large Deep Plate and Pour the Warm Water
Evenly Over It.  Then Rub the Couscous Lightly With Your Fingers To
Separate the Grains. Set the Plate Aside. 2. Heat Half the Oil in a
Large Saucepan, add the Onion and Carrots and Saute Gently for 10
Minutes. Stir in the Spices and Cook for a Further 2-3 Minutes,
Stirring. 3. Stir in the Corn, Zucchini and Chick Peas (May Use Fava
Beans instead). Then add the Water and Tomato Paste.  Bring To a
boil, Then Turn the Heat Down So That the Chick Pea Stew Simmers. 4.
By Now, the Couscous Will Have Absorbed the Water.  Put It Into a
Metal Sieve, Metal Colander or Steamer Saucepan, Breaking It Up a Bit
With Your Fingers Again as You Do So. If Your Container Has Large
Holes, You May Prefer To Line It With a Piece Of Cheesecloth To
Prevent the Grains from Falling Through, But I Never Found this
Necessary. 5. Put the Steamer, Colander or Sieve Over the Vegetable
Stew, Cover With a Lid or Plate and Cook Gently for 25-30 Minutes. 6.
Season To Taste With Pepper.  Stir the Remaining Olive Oil Into the
Couscous, Then Put the Couscous on a Large, Warmed Serving Dish,
Garnish With the Coriander and Serve Immediately.Serve With a Green
Salad.
