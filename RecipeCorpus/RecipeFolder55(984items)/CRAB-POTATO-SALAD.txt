Title: CRAB-POTATO SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Lump crabmeat
3 lg Idaho potatoes
3/4 c  Mayonaise
3 tb Sour cream
Juice of 1/2 a lemon
2    Scallions
Parsley sprigs
Salt & pepper
Pick any bits of shell out of the crabmeat and set aside. Cut the
potatoes into thirds, place in a medium saucepan, cover with salted
water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until tender,
about 20 minutes. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, peel and cut
into 1/4 inch-thick slices.

in a small bowl, combine mayonaise, sour cream, and the lemon juice;
season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Finely chop 2
whole scallions and a few sprigs of parsley.

To serve:  Arrange several slices of potato on a platter and season
with salt and pepper.  Smooth some dressing on top, sprinkle with
scallions and parsley, then add a layer of crab. Repeat, making
several layers and ending with crab on top.  (I'm sure you could just
mix everything together as well)
