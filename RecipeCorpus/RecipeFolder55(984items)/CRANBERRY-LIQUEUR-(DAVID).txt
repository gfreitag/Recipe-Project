Categories: Beverages
Yield: 4 Cups
1 c  White wine or water
1 c  Sugar
12 oz Cranberries

1    Knob fresh ginger, 1 inch

This is for folks who like to toast their feet by the fire while the
snow falls outside.  A little seasonal cheer... It also looks like a
good way to use up those nasty little berries that always seem to pop
up in every ones kitchen this time of year.  This is from Narsai
David, a Bay area restauranteur, chef and food critic.

Heat wine or water with sugar until dissolved and boiling. Place
cranberries, spices, lime and ginger in the bowl of a blender or food
processor.  Add boiling syrup and process for 30 to 40 seconds. Pour
into a container with a tight-fitting lid.  Add the gin, cover and
set aside for 1 or 2 weeks.  Strain through a fine sieve.

Makes about 4 cups.
