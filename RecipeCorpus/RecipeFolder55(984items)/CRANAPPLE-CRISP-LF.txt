Title: CRANAPPLE CRISP LF
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT FILLING----------------------------
8 c  Apples thinly sliced
1/2 c  Cranberries, fresh or frozen
(or use cranberry sauce)
1/3 c  Brown sugar - light
1/4 c  Raisins - golden
1 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Apple juice concentrate
(thawed)
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2/3 c  Quick-cooking oats
3 tb Flour
1/4 c  Brown sugar - light
1/4 ts Cinnamon
2 tb Apple juice concentrate
(thawed)
1. To make the topping, in a small bowl, combine the oats, flour,
sugar and cinnamon and stir to mix well. Add the juice concentrate
and stir until moist and crumbly. Set aside.

2. In a large bowl, combine the filling ingredients and toss to mix
well. Coat a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Place the filling mixture in the dish and sprinkle with the topping.

3. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes. Cover the dish loosely with
foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the filling is
bubbly and the topping is golden brown. Serve warm.

NOTES: I doubled the amount of topping at the request of my family
(it is that good!) Also, you can put just about anything into this. I
added jars of baby food fruits once when I didn't have cranberries
and raisins and it was wonderful.
