Title: COUSSINETS AUX POMMES
Categories: Cookies, Cakes, Desserts, French
Yield: 4 Servings
120 g  Flour
60 g  Sugar
Salt
Grated lemon peel
60 g  Hard butter
1    Egg yolk
4    Apples
40 g  Icing sugar
1 ts Cognac
40 g  Soft butter
1    Egg
Heat the oven to 190oC. Mix the flour, salt, and lemon peel. Add the
hardened butter, cut into very small pieces, and quickly mix
everything together by hand to form a ball. Cover the ball with a
cloth and leave to rest in a cool place (but NOT in the fridge), for
1 1/2 hours. Divide the pastry into 5 equal parts. Roll 4 into 15 cm
squares, about 1/2 cm thick. With the 5th part, make 4 small rounds.
Butter a baking tray. Peel and core the apples. Mix the icing sugar,
cognac, soft butter and egg yolk, and fill the apples with this
mixture. Place an apple on each suare of pastry, and fold up the
corners to cover the apples. Put a round of pastry on top of each
one. Put the apples onto the tray and brush with beaten egg. Bake in
the center of the oven until golden (about 25 mins). Serve hot or
cold. These may be served with whipped cream or with Marsala poured
over them. You may improve the stuffing by adding sultanas and
currants if you wish.
