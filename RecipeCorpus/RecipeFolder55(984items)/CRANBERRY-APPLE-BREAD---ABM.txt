Add ingredients in the order recommended for your bread machine. If
you prefer the cranberries and apples in larger pieces, add at the
raisin beep (if your machine has this), or when the first kneading is
almost completed. Cook the bread on the Sweet cycle or on the Basic
cycle. Fresh or frozen thawed cranberries may be substituted, but
decrease the amount of milk and check the consistency of the dough a
few times during the mixing process and be ready to adjust with a
little more milk or flour.
