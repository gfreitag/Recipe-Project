THE SOUP Arrange beef cubes slightly apart in a single layer in a
shallow baking pan. Bake in a 500 oven until well browned (about 20
minutes). Meanwhile, in a 3 1/2 quart or larger crockpot, combine
onion, celery, garlic, bay leaf and bell pepper. Transfer browned
beef to crockpot. Pour a little of the water into baking pan,
stirring to dissolve drippings and pour into crockpot. Add broth and
remaining water. Cover and cook on low about 8 hours. About 15
minutes before beef is done, prepare Yellow Rice. While rice is
cooking, increase cooker setting to high; add corn. Cover; cook for 5
minutes. Add cabbage; cover and cook until cabbage is bright green, 8
to 10 more minutes. Stir in cilantro; season with salt and pepper.
Ladle soup into wide, shallow bowls; add a scoop of rice to each. THE
RICE 1 tablespoon salad oil 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 cup
long-grain white rice 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 3/4 cups water
Heat oil in 2-quart pan over medium heat. Add the onion; cook,
stirring until onion is soft but not browned, (3 to 5 minutes). Stir
in the rice and tumeric; cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1
minute. Pour in the water and reduce heat to low and cook until rice
is tender, about 20 minutes.
