1 c  Milk room temperature

Add ingredients to the bread machine according to manufacturers
directions Select dough cycle.  Divide into 16 pieces and shape into
a ball and place in a greased 9 inch springform pan.  Cover with a
tea towel and let rise until doubled about 30 to 45 minutes.  Brush
lightly with egg and bake at 375 for 20 to 25 minutes or until
golden. Remove from pan immediately and cool on a wire rack Note: I
used 1 cup of frozen cranberries and added 1/2 cup of flour and it
just turn out perfect. I also made up a milk and icing sugar glaze
and put that on the top. If there are any left overs this would make
a great bread pudding.
