Title: CRANBERRY LIQUEUR
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
Yield: 1 Pint
1 lb Fresh Cranberries
1 1/8 c  Vodka
1 1/8 c  Sugar syrup (see recipe)
1/2    Orange wedge, scraped peel
Look for bright, plump cranberries, avoiding soft, crushed, or
shriveled ones. Season is Sept. to Dec. They will keep in the
refrigerator for 4-8 weeks (can also be frozen), but DO NOT wash them
until ready for use as moisture will make them spoil. Rinse
cranberries and chop in blender. Combine all ingredients in jar and
steep for 4-5 weeks. Strain and filter. Ready to serve. Note:
Cranberries can tend to have a bitter taste; more sugar syrup can be
added during the first steep or if after, let sit an additional week.
