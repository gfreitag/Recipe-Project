A really great recipe for cream cheese lemon muffins. They are a
perfect lazy Sunday breakfast treat served with cantaloupe or other
fruit. The aroma of them baking will get the sleepiest of sleepyheads
out of bed.
Mix egg, oil, milk and sugar together. Cut cream cheese into small
pieces, mix with 2 tbsps. flour. Grate 1 lemon into batter. Add rest
of ingredients. Eliminate salt and baking powder if you use
self-rising flour. Mix ingredients and spoon into 12 greased muffin
tins. Bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Topping 2 tbspns lemon
juice (fresh) 1 tbsp. sugar. Mix to form sugar. Pour over warm
muffins. Michael Salster
