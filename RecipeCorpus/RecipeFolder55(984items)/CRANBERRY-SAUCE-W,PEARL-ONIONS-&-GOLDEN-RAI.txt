Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar
10 oz Pearl onions
Blanched in boiling water
For 3 min -- drained/peeled
1/2 c  Golden raisins
1 lb Bag
Cranberries -- picked over
In a dry large deep heavy skillet cook the sugar over moderately high
heat, stirring constantly, until it is melted completely and a deep
golden caramel.  Remove the skillet from the heat, into the side of
the skillet carefully pour 1 cup hot water, a little at a time, and
cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the caramel is
dissolved. Add the onions, the raisins, and the cranberries and
simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until
the cranberries are tender. Remove the skillet from the heat, let the
cranberry sauce mixture cool, and transfer it to a serving dish.
