Title: CORNISH SAFFRON CAKE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
3 pk Saffron strands (0.05 g)
1 tb Boiling water
1/3 c  Sugar
1 c  Warm water (110'F./44'C.)
1 pk Active dry yeast (1/4 oz)
5 c  Bread flour
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Lard
1/2 c  Butter
1 2/3 c  Currants or mixed fruit
Lightly grease 2 9x5" loaf pans. Line a broiler pan with foil. Place
saffron on foil and spread thinly. Place pan under a very low broiler
and gently dry saffron (do not discolor) 3-4 minutes or until dry.

Place saffron in a small bowl and crush to a fine powder. Add boiling
water and let stand 8 hours. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of sugar in 1/4 cup
warm water. Add yeast, whisk and let stand 10-15 minutes or until
frothy. Put flour, salt, lard and butter into a bowl and cut in
finely. Mix in remaining sugar and currants. Stir saffron into
remaining warm water and add to flour mixture. Stir in yeast and mix
to form a dough. Knead lightly, cover and let rise in a warm place
until double in bulk.

Knead dough and divide in half. Press each piece to a rectangle with
width equal to length of loaf pan. Roll up dough, jellyroll style,
and place in greased loaf pans, seam side down. Press to fill
corners. Cover and let stand at room temperature until dough has
risen to top of pans. Preheat oven to 375'F. (190'C.). Bake in
preheated oven 35-45 minutes or until golden. If necessary, cover
with foil during baking to prevent overbrowning. Cool on a wire rack.
Let stand 1 day before serving.
