Title: CORNSTARCH PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salt
2 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla
MMMMM-------------------FOR CHOCOLATE PUDDING------------------------
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
MMMMM---------------------FOR BANANA PUDDING--------------------------
2    Bananas, chopped
MMMMM------------------FOR BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING-----------------------
Brown sugar instead of white
-1 T extra butter
Blend sugar, flour and salt.  Gradually add milk, mixing well. Cook
and stir until smooth, thickened and clear. At this point, add any
ingredients necessary for variations.

Stir a little of the pudding into beaten egg, then return to pudding.
(If you heat the egg too quickly, it'll cook a little. It's
unsightly, but it'll still taste pretty good.)

Add butter and vanilla, mix well, and chill in fridge. This is
delicious hot, too!
