Title: CRANBERRY-JALAPENO SAUCE
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 2 Cups
12 oz Cranberries, fresh or frozen
1    Orange
2 tb Tequila
1/2 c  Sugar
1 md Jalapeno pepper
Rinse the berries and discard any that are brown and soft. Finely
grate the zest only of the orange peel, then cut the orange in half
and squeeze out the juice. Add enough water to the orange juice to
make one cup of liquid.

Combine the berries, grated orange peel, juice and water, tequila, and
sugar in a large non-reactive pot, and bring it to a slow boil,
stirring occasionally as the sugar dissolves. Trim the jalapeno,
discard the seeds, and chop it finely.

When the berries begin to pop, add the chopped jalapeno and boil
everything together for about 5 more minutes, stirring with a long
wooden spoon. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little more water.

Remove the sauce from the heat and allow it to cool, stirring now and
again to prevent a skin from forming. Spoon it into a pretty dish,
and chill if you like.

This delicious, slightly spicy sauce is perfect alongside tamales,
with cheese-stuffed crepes, or any similarly rich-flavored dish, or
even with your Thanksgiving turkey.
