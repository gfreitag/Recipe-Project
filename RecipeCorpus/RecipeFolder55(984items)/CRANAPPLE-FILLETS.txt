Title: CRANAPPLE FILLETS
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Salmon fillets; or trout
-----apple bouillon-----
4 c  Apple juice
1/2 c  Onions; sliced
1    Celery; cut to 1" lengths
1    Bay leaf
4    Peppercorns
1 ts Salt
-----cranberry sauce-----
1 c  Apple juice
1/4 c  Lemon juice
2 c  Fresh cranberries
3/4 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Sugar
In a large pan combine 4 cups apple juice, onion celery, bay leaf,
peppercorn and salt.  Mix well and heat to boiling. Simmer for 10
minutes to blend flavors.

Place the fillets on a rack over the mixture and steam for 9-10
minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.
Carefully remove fish to a hot platter. Discard the mixture.

To prepare the cranberry sauce add 1 cup apple juice to small pan.
Stir in lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce to a
medium heat and add the cranberries. Cook until cranberry skins pop,
about 5 minutes. Partially mash the berries and stir for another 2-3
minutes.

Place fillets on a bed of romaine lettuce and cover with the cranberry
sauce.  (The sauce can also be made ahead of time and refrigerated,
providing a tasty combination of warm fish and cool sauce.)

Serves 6.
