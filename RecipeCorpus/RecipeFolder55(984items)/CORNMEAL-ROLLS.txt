Title: CORNMEAL ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Coarse cornmeal
4 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
4 tb Solid vegetable shortening
1    Egg
3/4 c  Buttermilk
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

In a bowl sift the dry ingredients.  Cut in the shortening. Beat the
egg slightly with the milk and add to the dry ingredients.

Toss on a floured board; knead slightly.  Roll 1/2-inch thick and cut
with a large (3-inch) biscuit cutter. With the back of a knife, make
a crease just off center on each round. Brush with butter, and fold
the smaller part over, like Parker House rolls. Press the fold
gently. Bake in the hot oven for 12 to 15 minutes.

Serve hot.

Yield:  about 8 rolls.
