Here's a way to make the cornstarch paste called for in many of our
recipes.

Our recipes call for cornstarch paste as the thickening agent without
specifying the exact proportions of cornstarch and water. This recipe
is offered as an approximate guide until you find what works best for
you. Some cooks prefer the thin paste, some prefer thick.

Thoroughly mix together cornstarch and cold water. Always stir mixture
again just before using because the starch settles.
