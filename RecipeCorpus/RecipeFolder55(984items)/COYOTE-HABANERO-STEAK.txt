Title: COYOTE HABANERO STEAK
Categories: Chile head
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Top sirloin steak
2/3 c  Thawed frozen orange
Concentrate
1/2 c  Tequila
1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Chopped fresh ginger
4    Minced cloves of garlic
1 ts Salt and crushed Mexican
Oregano
1 ts Hatch extra hot New Mexican
Chile powder
1    4 minced Habaneros (to your
Heat level of liking)
Cilantro sprigs
Lime wedges
Combine all ingredients except the lime wedges and cilantro sprigs.
Marinate steaks for *at least 4 hours*. Grill steaks over the BBQ &
brush with marinade. Steaks should be cooked to medium rare, IMHO to
be at peak flavor. Serve this with a combination of roasted sweet
peppers & chiles (eg New Mex, poblanos, etc..). It also goes well
with Coyote summer salsa.
