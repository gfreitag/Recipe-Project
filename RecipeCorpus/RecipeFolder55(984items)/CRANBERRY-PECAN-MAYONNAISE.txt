Title: CRANBERRY PECAN MAYONNAISE
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Sandwiches, Sauces/dips
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
2 tb Dijon mustard
1 tb Honey
1/4 c  Cranberries; chopped, finely
2 tb Pecans; toasted and chopped
Salt & pepper to taste
Combine Mayo and mustard in a bowl.  Whisk in the honey.  Fold in
cranberries and pecans.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Spread
cranberry mayonaisse on bread and top with cold turkey leftovers.
Good with lettuce and gouda cheese.

In a pinch, I have subbed jellied cranberry sauce for the chopped
cranberries and it's still good!
