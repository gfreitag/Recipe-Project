Title: COUS-COUS TABBOULEH
Categories: Vegetarian, Low fat, Salads
Yield: 1 Servings
250    Grammes (about 1 cup)
Cous-cous
2    Beef tomatoes
sm Bunch spring onions
(scallions)
1    Tin red kidney or other
Beans
1 sm Tin sweetcorn
1/2    Red sweet (bell) pepper,
Chopped
Lemon juice
1/2 tb Olive oil (optional)
Seasoning
Soak the cous-cous in about double its volume of boiling water, until
all the water is absorbed.  Peel and chop the tomatoes and onions,
and drain the sweetcorn and beans (you will probably want to rinse
the latter). Mix everything together, season and dress with lemon
juice, and possibly 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil for the flavour - it
makes so much salad that it really doesn't up the % CFF too much.
