Title: COURGETTES PROVENCALE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Courgettes
1 tb Olive Oil
1 ts Garlic Salt
1 tb Tomato Puree
Wash, top and tail the courgettes and slice them into rounds about a
quarter of an inch thick. Heat a solid saucepan with a lid over a high
heat. When it is really hot, put in the oil and immeadiately add the
courgettes. Put the lid on and give the saucepan a good shake,
holding the lid down! After 45 seconds, take the lid off, add the
garlic salt and tomato puree and give it a quick stir. Replace the
lid, shake the pan vigourously again, cook for 45 seconds and serve.
Thats it! The courgettes are hot and crisp and the tomato and garlic
have formed a coating over them.
