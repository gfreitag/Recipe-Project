Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Shortening
3/4 c  Milk
Combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt; stir well. Cut in
shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.
Sprinkle milk evenly over flour mixture, stirring just until dry
ingredients are moistened.  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
surface, and knead 10 to 12 times. Roll dough to 1/2 inch thickness;
cut with a 2 inch biscuit cutter. Place biscuits on greased baking
sheets. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes or until biscuits are lightly
browned.
