-Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
1    -bag (12 ounces) fresh
Canberries, picked over
1 1/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Sugar
2 lb Cream cheese; at room
-temperatue, cut into
-8 pieces
2 ts Vanilla extract
4    Eggs; at room temperature
1 pt Sour cream; at room temperat
1. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine the cranberries and 3/4
cup water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat and boil, stirring
occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the mixture reduces to
1-1/4 cups, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/3
cup of the sugar until dissolved. Strain the mixture through a coarse
sieve and let the puree cool completely.
2. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Butter and flour a
9-by-2-3/4-inch springform pan. In a large bowl, using an electric
mixer, beat the cream cheese with the remaining 1 cup plus 2
tablespoons sugar and the vanilla at low speed until smooth. Beat in
the eggs one at a time, beating until just blended. Stir in the sour
cream.
3. Spoon half of the cream cheese mixture into the prepared pan.
Drop 8 or 9 rounded teaspoons of the cranberry puree randomly over
the top. Spoon half of the remaining cheesecake mixture evenly over
the first layer and dot with half of the remaining puree. Repeat with
the remaining cheesecake mixture and puree. (Avoid dropping puree in
the center of more than 1 layer.) With a blunt knife, cut through the
batter in a swirling motion to distribute the cranberry puree.
4. Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake in the lower part of the
oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in for 1
hour longer. Transfer the cake to a rack and let cook to room
temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight before serving.
