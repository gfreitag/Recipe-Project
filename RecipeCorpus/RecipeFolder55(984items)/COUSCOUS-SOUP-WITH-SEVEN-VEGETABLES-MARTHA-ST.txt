1. To make stock, heat butter in a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan.
Add chicken breasts and wings and cook over medium heat until golden,
about 8 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside. Remove all but 1 T of
fat from pan and add onions, carrot, saffron, and turmeric. Cook over
low heat until onions are soft and translucent, about 25 minutes.

2. Add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Add chicken and remaining
stock ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook, skimming often, for 1
1/2 hours. Remove chicken; strain stock through a fine sieve into a
clean pot. Reserve wings for another use. When breasts are cool
enough to handle, discard skin and pull meat off bones in medium
shreds. Measure out 1 1/2 C; reserve remaining chicken for another
use. Cover and refrigerate.

3. Let stock cool slightly, then refrigerate, covered, overnight, or
until fat congeals on top. Remove with a large spoon and return stock
to stove.

4. To make soup, bring stock to a simmer, add chick-peas and
vegetables, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes, adding chicken
meat and couscous a few minutes before serving. Garnish each serving
with a few cilantro leaves.
