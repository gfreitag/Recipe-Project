Categories: Sauces, Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Ripe medium peaches
2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries
1 tb Kirsch
6    Scoops vanilla ice cream,
-about 1 1/2 pints
1.  Blanch peaches in boiling water 30 seconds. Immediately rinse
with cold running water; drain well. Peel peaches; cut in half;
remove and discard pits. 2. Heat 2 cups water, the sugar and vanilla
in medium saucepan to boiling; boil, stirring occasionally, 5
minutes. Sugar should be completely dissolved. Add peach halves;
poach until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes.  Remove peaches
with slotted spoon to bowl, reserving syrup; refrigerate until cold,
about 1 hour. 3. Add cranberries to syrup. Heat to boiling; reduce
heat. Simmer 10 minutes. Puree mixture in food processor or blender;
stir in kirsh. Refrigerate, covered, until cold, about 1 hour. 4. At
serving time, stand 2 peach halves upright in each of 6 stemmed
glasses; place a scoop of ice cream between halves; spoon cranberry
puree over ice cream. NOTES: If fresh peaches aren't available, you
can used canned freestone (Elberta) peaches. The cranberry puree has
a nubby texture; if you want a smoother sauce, press puree through
fine-mesh sieve to remove bits of skin.
