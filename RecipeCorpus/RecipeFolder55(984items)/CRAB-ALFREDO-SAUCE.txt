Title: CRAB ALFREDO SAUCE
Categories: Sauce, Alfredo, Red lobster, Kathy
Yield: 1 Servings
4 tb Butter or margarine
4 tb Flour
2 c  Half-and-half (heavy cream
If you REALLY feel wicked)
About 1/2 cup (or more to
Taste) grated Parmesan
Cheese
Salt and white pepper to
Taste
Few grains cayenne pepper
(optional)
6    8 oz. cooked snow crab meat,
Cut into chunks
Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Stir in the flour, and cook briefly
until the mixture looks sandy.  Do NOT let it color. Wisk in the
half- and-half, and stir until the mixture forms a thick sauce. Stir
in the cheese, and season to taste.  Simmer for a few minutes to
blend the flavors, and stir in the crab meat.  Cook JUST until the
crab is heated through. Serve over cooked linguini, with additional
Parmesan cheese and hot red pepper flakes on the side.

Before some purist jumps me, I KNOW this isn't a classic Alfredo, but
it is a very good dish, and remarkably easy to make.

This may be varied by substituting cooked lobster meat for the crab,
or by adding 36 cooked, peeled and deveined medium shrimp, and about
a quarter of a cup of chopped cooked broccoli instead of the crab
meat.
