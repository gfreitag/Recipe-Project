Title: Smashed Radishes in Soy Dressing
Categories: Vegetables, Salads, Dressings
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb peanut oil
1 ts sesame oil
1/4 ts fresh ginger juice
1 ea Chinese parsley for garnish
24 ea fresh red radishes
2 ts salt
1 ts white vinegar
1 ts sugar
3 ts thin soy sause
Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash.  Using bottom of heavy
drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack them -
not mash them - so dressing can get into flesh.  Avoid rendering a
crushing blow no matter how you feel that day.  Sprinkle radishes all over
with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for about 15 minutes at room
temperature.  Prepare dressing:  Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce,
peanut oil, sesame oil and fresh ginger juice.  Double amount of vinegar
for a sharper taste, if desired.  Drain liquid from radishes (salt will
have drawn off quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and
refrigerate for 30 minutes.  If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on
dressing 30 minutes before serving.  Immediately before serving, transfer
radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese parsley and serve.
