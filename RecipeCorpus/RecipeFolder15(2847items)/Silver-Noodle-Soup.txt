Categories: Soups, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  water
2 1/2 oz (approx) bean thread noodles
1 tb minced fresh coriander
4 ea sprigs of coriander **
2 ts sesame oil
3 tb peanut oil
1/3 lb pork butt, slivered
1 tb slivered fresh ginger root
2 ts thin soy sauce
2 ts dry sherry
1/4 c  slivered mustard green
Use Szechuan mustard green in recipe. Use sprigs of coriander for
garnish.
Preparation:  Marinate pork and ginger in thin soy and sherry for 30
minutes.  Rinse chunk of Szechuan mustard green to remove all traces
of chili coating; sliver like pork.  The chili flavor will still be
there, but in delicate balance with the mustard and pork.  Soak
noodles in warm water for 15 minutes, then rinse and drain.
Stir-fry:  Add oil to hot wok; when it just begins to smoke, add pork
and ginger mixture.  Stir-fry 30 seconds.  Add Szechuan mustard green;
stir-fry 2 minutes.
Soup:  In 2-quart saucepan, boil the water.  Add hot pork stir-fry;
simmer 3 minutes.  Five minutes before serving, bring broth to boil,
and add soaked noodles and minced coriander.  Simmer 3 minutes or
until noodles are soft, but not pasty.  Pour into serving bowl,
garnish with coriander sprigs and sesame oil, and serve.
