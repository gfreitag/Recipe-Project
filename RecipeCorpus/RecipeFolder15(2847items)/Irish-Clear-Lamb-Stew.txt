Title: Irish Clear Lamb Stew
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Irish, Stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Butter
2 1/2 c  Stock or water
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 tb Chopped chives
2 1/2 lb Lamb:  "neck chops"
4 ea Medium-sized onions
4 ea Medium-sized carrots
1 x  Salt and pepper
1 tb Lamb fat
Don't let the butcher trim the fat off the lamb chops!  Shred some of it
and render it down in a heavy casserole.  Peel onions and potatoes, scrape
carrots.  Cut the meat into 8 pieces;  only excess fat is cut away.  Bones
need not be removed.  Cut the carrots and onions in quarters.  Toss the
meat in the hot fat until its color changes;  repeat with onions and
carrots.  Add stock and season carefully.  Put whole potatoes on top.
Simmer gently until the meat is cooked, approximately 2 hours.  Pour off
the cooking liquid:  degrease it, and reheat in a saucepan.  Check
seasoning.  Then swirl in butter, chives, parsley, and pour back over
stew.
