Title: Citrus-Buttered Lobster Tails
Categories: Seafood, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 ts Finely Shredded Orange Peel
1/8 ts Salt
1 x  Dash Ground Ginger
1 x  Dash Paprika
16 oz (2) Frozen Lobster Tails
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Butter Or Margaine
1 tb Lemon Juice
Place frozen lobster tails in a shallow baking dish.  Micro-cook, covered,
on 30% power for 7 to 8 minutes or till thawed, rotating dish a
quarter-turn once.  The tails are thawed when the shells are flexible
enough to bend.  Using a heavy knife, cut through the center of the top
shells.  Continue cutting through meat but not through undersehells.
Spread the tails open, butterfly style, so meat is on top.  Return to
shallow baking dish.  Pour water atop.  Micro-cook, covered, on 50% power
for 6 to 8 minutes or just till meat is opaque, rotating dish a
quarter-turn every minute.  (Shield cooked meat with small pieces of foil,
if necessary, to prevent overcooking.)  Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine butter or margarine, lemon juice, orange peel, salt,
ginger and paprika.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power for 1 1/2 to 2
minutes or till butter is melted.  Mix well.  Drizzle lobster tails with
butter mixture.
