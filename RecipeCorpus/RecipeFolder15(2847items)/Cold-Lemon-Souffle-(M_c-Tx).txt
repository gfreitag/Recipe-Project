Title: Cold Lemon Souffle (M_c-Tx)
Categories: Desserts, Snacks
Yield: 12 servings
2    Envelopes unflavored
-gelatin
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
2 c  Fresh berries (optional)
5    Eggs separated
1 1/4 c  Sugar
2 c  Whipping cream
3 lg Lemons (2/3 c. juice)
Beat together egg yolks and sugar.  Grate rinds of lemons (I don't use
this) and squeeze out juice, measuring out 2/3 cups lemon juice.  Add rind
to the egg yolks, then gradually add the 2/3 cups lemon juice, beating all
the while.  (This "cooks" the egg yolk.) Soften the gelatin in 1/2 cup of
hot water and beat until it is dissolved. Allow to cool slightly. Whip the
cream lightly and stir into lemon mixture; then stir in gelatin and
continue stirring until mixture begins to thicken. Beat egg whites with
cream of tartar until stiff but not dry; fold into lemon mixture. Spoon
souffle into dish and chill in refrigerator until completely set (about two
hours).  Serve with berries if desired.  12 servings.
