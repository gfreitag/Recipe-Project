Title: Carrot, Celery, and Apple Juice with Sorrel
Categories: Vegetables, Fruits
Yield: 10 servings
1    Granny Smith apple
3    To 6 sorrel leaves to taste
3 lb Of fresh whole carrots
1    Or 2 stalk of celery
This juice requires the use of a juice machine such as the Champion, the
Juice Man, Olympic, or the like. The sorrel adds a nice lemony tartness to
the drink that helps the celery balance the sweetness of the carrots. For
the apple, use no other than the Granny Smith, its sour flavor is an
essential ingredient to this juice.
********************************************************************* Clean
the carrots and remove any green parts. Wash the celery but do not remove
the leaves. Cut the granny smith apple into 1/8th segments and remove the
bitter seed pod. Rinse the sorrel leaves. Run everything through the juicer
starting with the carrots. After one or two carrots have been run through
the machine put the celery and sorrel through and then alternate carrots
and apples until they are gone. Strain the juice through a couple layers of
cheesecloth or a fine strainer to remove the pulp that makes it through the
juicer screen if desired (this will produce a clear juice devoid of the
grittyness, that some people do like).
