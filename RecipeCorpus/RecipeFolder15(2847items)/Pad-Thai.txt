Preliminaries: Soak noodles in warm water to cover for 30 minutes.
Procedure: Trim any fat or sinew off the chicken and cut the breasts
across the grain into 3-inch-by-1/4-inch strips. Shell and devein the
shrimp. Seed and mince the chilies. Mince the garlic and ginger. Finely
chop the onions, reserving the green part for garnish. Combine the fish
sauce, vinegar and sugar in a small bowl.
Cook the noodles in rapidly boiling water for 1 minute or until tender.
Refresh under cold water, drain and blot dry on paper towels. Toss the
noodles with 2 teaspoons vegetable oil.
Heat a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat and add the rest of
the vegetable oil. Fry the chilies for 30 seconds. Add the garlic, ginger
and onions and stir-fry until tender. Do not let brown. Add the chicken
and stir-fry until cooked. Stir in the shrimp and fish sauce mixture and
cook until the shrimp turns pink.
Make a well in the center of these ingredients and add the egg. When
the egg starts to set, stir to scramble it and toss with the other
ingredients. Stir in the noodles, bean sprouts and half the peanuts.
Cook the pad thai just until the bean sprouts begin to wilt. (If the pan
is too small, work in two batches.) Transfer the mixture to a platter and
sprinkle with the remaining peanuts and onions. Garnish with lime
wedges and mint leaves and serve.
