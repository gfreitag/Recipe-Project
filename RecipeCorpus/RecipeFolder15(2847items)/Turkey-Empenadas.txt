Title: Turkey Empenadas
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts salt
1/3 c  butter
1/4 c  water, cold
1 tb milk
4 ts corn meal for topping
1 c  cooked turkey, cubed
1 1/3 c  cheddar cheese, grated
4 oz green chilies, drained
1 c  flour whole wheat
1/4 c  corn meal
Mix together turkey, cheese and chilies; set aside.  In a different bowl,
mix together flour, cornmeal and salt.  Cut in butter until particles are
the size of small peas (a pastry blender makes this an easy job).  Sprinkle
with water and mix with pastry blender or fork until pastry can be formed
into a ball.  Add a little more water if necessary.
Divide dough into balls, one ball for each two servings; divide turkey
mixture into same number as dough.
Turn one dough ball onto floured board and roll into an 11" square.  Place
on oiled cookie sheet.  Spoon one part of turkey mixture over 1/2 of pastry
coming to 1 1/2" of the edge.  Fold other half of pastry over it, and crimp
edges to seal them.  Repeat this procedure with each ball of dough.
Brush turnovers with milk.  Sprinkle remaining corn meal on top.  Bake at
400 degrees for 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow to cool slightly;
slice into wedges to serve.  Serves 4
