Title: Fried New Potatoes and Onions
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1    Clove garlic (to taste)
1/4 c  Good extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
2 lb New potatoes
1 md Onion
1 oz Fresh dill
Cut the potatoes into 3/4"x3/4"x1/8" pieces. Coarsly dice the onion. Crush
the garlic and chop the dill fine. Split the oil between two seperate
frying pans. Slowly fry the potatoes in one and starting it slightly later,
saute the onions in the other. The potatoes should be just crisp on the
outside, moist and flufy on the inside and the onions should be clear with
the edges just starting to turn brown. When both are done, add the garlic
to the onions, and cook for only 30 seconds or a minute, no more. Add the
onions and garlic with the fresh dill to the potatoes. Carefully combine
them so the onions and dill are evenly distributed and the dill just
'wilts'. Serve immediately.
