Terry says, "One of the guides, Jim Echols, gave me this recipe.
I would prepare monster-sized batches of it for him and the other
guides to use in preparing blackened (cajun) trout. -- A special
surprise for guests at shore lunches.  Also try it in hamburgers,
on sauteed chicken or turkey, and on popcorn.
