Categories: Vegetables

1/2 c  Nami dried black mushrooms
1/2 c  Cloud Ear dried fungus
1/2 c  dried lily flowers
2 oz bean thread noodles, soaked
1 ts salt (to taste)
8 tb peanut oil for stir-frying

4 ea green onions, shredded
**white Chinese turnip, shredded
**white Chinese celery, shredded
**Nami dried black mushrooms, soaked & shredded
**Cloud Ear dried fungus, soaked
**Dried lily flowers, soaked & hard tips removed
Preparation:  Shred in 2" lengths:  carrots, turnip, Chinese celery &
beancurd.  Shred onions, greens & all, into 2" lengths.
Rinse, then soak in hot water:  enough mushrooms, fungus and lily
flowers to give specified amounts.  Shred mushrooms, chop fungus. Soak
bean thread noodles. Bean thread noodles are important because they
soak up excess moisture from other vegetables.  Vegetables should be
moist but not soggy or watery after stir-frying.
Stir-frying:  Stir-fry fresh vegetables separately with about 1
tablespoon oil for each, in hot wok. Add salt to taste. Drain off
excess water, reserve.  (Soybean sprouts should be cooked until they
are slightly charred for fullest flavor.) To stir-fry dried soaked
ingredients, begin with hot wok, add 2-3 tablespoons oil, then add
mushroom, fungus & lily flowers.  Stir-fry green onions, add all other
ingredients to them, including noodles.  Allow dish to cool before
serving.
NOTE:  Fresh or canned bamboo shoot may be substituted for any
vegetable.  Seaweed may be used instead of some of the fungus.
