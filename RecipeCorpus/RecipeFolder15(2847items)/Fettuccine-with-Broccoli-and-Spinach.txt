Title: Fettuccine with Broccoli and Spinach
Categories: Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1    Onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
Pinch tarragon
4 tb Butter, cut into
-6 to 8 pieces
12 oz Delicate fettuccine
-preferably fresh
1    Bunch spinach, stemmed,
-well washed
1    Bunch broccoli, cut into
-florets, the stems peeled
-and cubed
4 sm To md-sized young carrots
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Broth
Steam spinach until just bright green. Let cool. Squeeze out liquid and
chop into bite-sized pieces, then arrange in mounds on the edge of a
serving plate. Steam broccoli florets until bright green and still crunchy,
remove from steamer and place on platter alongside spinach. Dice 2 of the
carrots and place in a small saucepan with the wine, broth, onion or
shallots, garlic and tarragon. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook until
carrots are tender. Uncover and boil until liquid is reduced to about 2
tablespoons: Remove from heat. Mash carrots with their liquid, using a fork
or food processor. When the mixture cools to just warm, whisk in the
butter. Set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add broccoli stems
and pasta. It should take about 3 minutes for both the pasta and broccoli
to be cooked to perfection. (Judge doneness by the pasta -- it's better to
have the broccoli underdone than the pasta overdone.) Meanwhile, finely
grate remaining carrots. When pasta and broccoli are al dente, drain and
serve, surrounded by the spinach mounds and broccoli florets. Spoon
carrot-butter over pasta and vegetables, and sprinkle grated carrot over
the top. Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.
