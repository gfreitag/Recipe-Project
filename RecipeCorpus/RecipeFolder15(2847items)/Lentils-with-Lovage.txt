Title: Lentils with Lovage
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1    Sprig of thyme
1    Curl of orange peel
Light stock or water
2    Shallots; chopped
Butter
12 oz Whole green lentils (Le Puy)
Handful of chopped lovage
Soften the chopped shallots in a little butter without colouring them. Stir
in the lentils.  Add a handful of chopped lovage, the sprig of thyme,
orange peel and stock or unsalted water to cover well.  Simmer until
tender.  Drain off and reduce the cooking liquor to make a little sauce,
enriching it with more butter and seasoning to taste.  In the absence of
lovage, use the young leaves and tenderest parts of a celery heart, and
season the dish with a pinch each of celery salt, lemon zest and powdered
curry spices.
