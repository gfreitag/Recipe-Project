Categories: Breads
Yield: 18 servings
1 tb Canola oil
1 ea Egg white
2 c  White flour
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/3 c  Lukewarm water
1 tb Brown sugar
1/2 tb Lite salt or less or none
So handy to have in the refrigerator, with only a short rising time
remaining. This versatile dough can be used for rolls one night and pizza
the next.
To Prepare Dough For Refrigeration: Dissolve yeast in warm water and
combine with dried potatoes and brown sugar. Add lite salt, oil and egg
white. Stir in 1 cup white flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour. Mix in
enough additional white flour(1/2 to 1 cup) to make the dough easy to
handle. Knead on floured board until dough is smooth and elastic. Place in
lightly oiled bowl(large enough for dough to double). Cover tightly and
refrigerate at least 8 hours and not more than five days.
Two Hours Before Serving: Remove from refrigerator. Shape into rolls and
allow to rise  30-45 minutes or until doubled in size. Bake in 350 degree
oven for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned. Makes 18 rolls
