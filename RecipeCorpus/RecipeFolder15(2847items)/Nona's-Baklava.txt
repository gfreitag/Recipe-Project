Title: Nona's Baklava
Categories: Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 20 servings
1 lb walnuts, chopped
1 lb almonds, chopped
1 ts nutmeg
1 c  butter (salted)
1 c  honey
1/2 c  sweet butter, melted
1 ea box fillo dough
Heat regular (salted) butter with honey until mixture bubbles.  Set aside
about 1/8 of it.  In a bowl, combine nuts and nutmeg.  Pour remaining 7/8
of honey syrup over nut mix to moisten.
Lay fillo dough on cutting board lengthwise.  Brush one layer at a time
with melted sweet butter (unsalted) until you have 3 layers.  Line up a
1/4-inch wide strip of nut mix along edge of dough about 1/4-inch thick.
Pick up that edge and roll dough into a cylinder with nut mix in the
center.  Cut each cylinder into 8 pieces and place in 9 x 13-inch baking
dish.  Repeat until all nut mix and fillo dough are used.
Bake at 350 degrees until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes.  Warm
leftover syrup and spoon on top.  Let cool before serving.
If you cannot locate fillo dough, use our pie crust recipe, roll dough
very thin, and use only one layer of dough instead of three.
Makes 1 batch.
