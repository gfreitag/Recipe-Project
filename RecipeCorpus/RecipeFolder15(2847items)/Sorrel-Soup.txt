Categories: Soups, Side dish

3 3/4 c  Vegetable or chicken stock
Salt to taste
2 tb Butter
1 oz Fresh sorrel leaves
2 tb Heavy cream
This is a lovely soup that is quick and easy to make and is a real comfort
soup. The recipe was given to us by the folks at Bellwether Farms in Fort
Collins CO (though it has been modified just a tad). It is certainly very
basic and probably quite old, though no one knows its origin.
********************************************************************* The
original recipe called for light cream. It is likely that what was light
cream when this recipe was first devised is more like what we now call
heavy cream. The light cream of the local American grocery store in 1990
breaks up as if the acid nature of the sorrel is too much for the
constitution of the cream. Melt butter in a pan. Add sorrel and cook gently
for 4 to 5 minutes. Add salt. Add cream and cook gently until thick.
Gradually add the stock and heat slowly. Do not allow to boil.
