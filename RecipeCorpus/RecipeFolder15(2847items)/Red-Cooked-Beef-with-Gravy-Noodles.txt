Red-Cooking Meat:   In medium hot wok, toast peppercorns until fragrant
(avoid burning); crush & finely mince with cleaver; reserve. Cut beef into
1 1/2" chunks.  Heat cooking oil in hot wok until it starts to smoke; brown
beef in several batches; drain oil & discard. Combine peppercorns &
remaining ingredients of red-cooking liquid; add to wok. Bring to boil;
reduce heat & simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until meat is very
tender.  (If liquid evaporates before meat is tender, add cup of water or
stock and continue cooking.)  Remove meat from liquid. If desired, cool
meat, cover and refrigerate. Boiling Noodles: Bring 4 qts. water to rolling
boil; add noodles. Drain when still slightly undercooked. Stir-frying: Heat
peanut oil in hot wok.  When oil starts to smoke, add scallions & stir-fry
until fragrant.  Add garlic, ginger & Napa cabbage; stir-fry for about 1
minute, until cabbage is slightly wilted. Add meat & all gravy ingredients
except cornstarch paste. Reduce heat to medium, cover, & simmer for about 3
minutes.  Remove cover; dribble in enough cornstarch paste to make a light
gravy; not too heavy as you want to coat noodles, but not too soupy either.
Turn up heat; when sauce returns to boil, add noodles. Toss to mix (&
reheat) noodles.  Transfer to warmed serving platter or large bowl. Serves
