Title: Perfect Pasta Everytime
Categories: Pasta, Italian, Lowfat, Lowcal
Yield: 1 servings
Water
2 oz Dry pasta (any type)
Salt
1. Fill large stock pot with water (6 to 8 quarts). Pasta should have
enough room to swim around freely. (you need at least 1 quart of water for
each 4 oz. of dry pasta.
2. After water has come to a rolling boil, add salt (1 tablespoon per
pound of dry pasta). DO NOT ADD OIL, it will make the sauce slide off.
3. Pour pasta in water and stir constantly until water returns to boiling.
(Stirring prevents pasta from sticking together).
4. Start timimg the pasta once the water is boiling. As pasta cooks, Stir
occasionally to keep it moving in the water. To determine doneness, scoop
up a piece and bite into it. Pasta should be tender, yet resilient to the
bite. Pasta should NEVER be cooked until mushy.
5. Drain pasta in a large collander in the sink. DO NOT RINSE THE PASTA,
unless it is to be used in a salad. (The reason: Pasta needs the starch on
the surface to mix with the sauce to thicken it).
6. Use 2 oz dry pasta for each serving. (Contains about 225 calories and
no chol but lots of complex carbohydrates).
