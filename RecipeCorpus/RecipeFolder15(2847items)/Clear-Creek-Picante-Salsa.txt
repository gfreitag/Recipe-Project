Saute onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat until tender.

more if desired. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
Remove cover and simmer an additional 30 minutes or until thickened.
Remove from heat and add cilantro and stir. Chill salsa overnight before
using.  Serve as a dip for chips or as a spicy topping on your favorite
Mexican or Tex-Mex food.  Makes about a quart of salsa.

the desired heat level or add another kind of hot pepper such as
serrano or jalapeno to give it a heat boost.
