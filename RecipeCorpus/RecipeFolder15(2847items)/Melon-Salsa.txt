Title: Melon Salsa
Categories: Salsa
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb unseasoned rice vinegar
1 ea juice of one lime
1/4 c  sugar to taste
1 ea ripe cantaloupe
1/2 ea sweet red pepper, seeded
2 ea serrano chiles
2 tb finely chopped cilantro
Finely chop all, mix and let sit at least 30 minutes before

In all of the recipes, jalapenos can be used if you can't find
serranos. Mark Miller calls for rinsing the onion with hot water in
a strainer before adding it to the salsa.
