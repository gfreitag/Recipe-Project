Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts sugar
1 tb dry sherry
1/2 ts MSG (opt)
2 tb cornstarch and
1/8 c  stock for cornstarch paste
2 ea egg whites
1 tb cooked smoked ham, minced
1 tb peanut oil
4 ea green onions, minced
1/2 ts fresh ginger root, minced
3 c  chicken stock
1 c  canned cream-style corn
1/4 ts salt
1/4 ts white pepper
Wash corn in stock.  Drain corn, reserving stock; chop finely and
return to stock.  In a cup, mix cornstarch and cold stock to make
paste.
In heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat oil until hot.  Saute green onions &
ginger for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly to avoid burning.
Add stock & corn; stir & bring to just under boil.  Add salt, pepper &
sugar.  Simmer 15 minutes or until ready to serve.  Just before
serving, turn up heat again to a bubbly boil.  Dribble in cornstarch
paste until soup acquires a waxy translucence.  It should still be
thin, but not watery.  Add sherry.  Now beat egg white with a fork to
a light froth.  Turn off heat.  Quickly swirl in egg whites. Pour into
serving bowl.  Garnish with ham.  Serve.  Serves 4
