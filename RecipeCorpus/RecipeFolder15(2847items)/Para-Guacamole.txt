Title: Para-Guacamole
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 12 servings
3 ea Juice of 2-3 lemons
1/4 ts powdered cumin
1 ts Tabasco sauce
1 ea Salt to taste
3 ea california avocadoes
1 ea poblano chile
2 ea serrano chiles
1 ea small white onion
3 ea cloves garlic
Roast the poblano chile over a low flame (or under a broiler) until the
skin begins to char and blister. Place in a paper bag and let set for a few
minutes.  While the poblano is 'steaming', mince the onion and place in a
large bowl.  De-seed  and  scoop  out  the  avocadoes,  taking  care to
discard any brown portions Place the avocado in bowl with onion and pound
into slightly lumby paste.  Take the poblano chile out of the bag and peel
it, removing the stem, seeds, and internal membranes.  Remove the stem end
of the serranos Peel the garlic cloves.  Place the poblano,serranos,
garlic, lemon juice, cumin, and Tabasco sauce in a blender and whizz until
pureed.  Add this  to the avocado/onion mixture in the large bowl and mix
thoroughly.  The flavor blends better if the guacamole is left in the
refrigerator for an hour or two before serving.
There are at least as many variations of Guacamole as there are people who
make it, but this version may offend some purists, hence the name.
This recipe is the result of experimentation with the basic guacamole
recipe.  I personally  prefer more  cumin in  it, but  you don't want the
result to taste more like bean dip than guacamole.  Never use Florida
avocadoes for guacamole -- you'll get a watery green pulp.
