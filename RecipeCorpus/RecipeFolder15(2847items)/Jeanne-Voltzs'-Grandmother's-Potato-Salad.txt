Title: Jeanne Voltzs' Grandmother's Potato Salad
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2    Large scallions, finely
-chopped, including green
-parts
2    Ribs celery, diced
1/2 c  Home made mayonnaise
1 ts Celery seed
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
2 1/2 lb New potatoes
-(red skins are great)
2    Hard boiled eggs
1 ts Dijon mustard
2 tb Balsamic or cider vinegar
-(I prefer the balsamic)
3 tb Olive oil (for this
-recipe I prefer a
-Greek oil)
Scrub potatoes and place in a saucepan with water enough to just cover
them. Cover the pan, bring to a boil, and boil until potatoes are barely
tender, about 15 - 20 minutes. Remove potatoes and let cool until
comfortable to handle, then peel them, cube them and place in a large bowl.
In a small bowl stir the mustard and vinegar together and then beat in the
olive oil.  Pour the mixture over the potatoes and gently toss and coat
well. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours. After potatoes have cooled add
the scallions, celery, mayonnaise, celery seed and salt and pepper to
taste. Again toss gently but thoroughly. Turn into a serving bowl lined
with lettuce if you like, slice the eggs and arrange in a circle around the
outside of the salad.  Cover and refrigerate or serve at once. SOME
SUGGESTIONS:  When I have BBQ I usually eat the salad as the recipe states,
or with a little Hungarian paprika sprinkled over the top.
