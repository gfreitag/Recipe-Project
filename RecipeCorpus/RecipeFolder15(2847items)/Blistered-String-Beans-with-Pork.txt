Title: Blistered String Beans with Pork
Categories: Pork, Vegetables, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb mustard greens, minced
1/4 c  chicken stock
1/2 tb thin soy sauce
1 ts sesame oil
3 c  peanut oil
1 lb green string beans 6" long
1/8 lb ground pork
1/2 tb dried shrimp, minced
2 tb dry sherry
Preparation:  Rinse beans & break off ends; dry them thoroughly to
reduce spattering during deep-frying.  Wash dried shrimp, then soak in
sherry for 1 hour.  Mix sherry from shrimp with chicken stock, soy
sauce & sesame oil.  Reserve in small cup.
Deep-frying:  Heat peanut oil in wok or deep-fryer to moderately hot.
It is ready when string bean boils vigorously on the surface.  Deep-
fry beans in several batches, until they shrivel slightly. Remove,
drain & keep warm.  If you are using same wok for stir-frying,
carefully ladle the excess cooking oil into can for future use,
leaving 2 T in wok.
Stir-frying:  Begin stir-frying immediately, otherwise beans will be
overcooked.  Heat oil to very hot.  Add ground pork; stir-fry until it
is no longer pink, break up meat into little specks as you stir.  Add
shrimp & mustard greens, stir for 30 seconds.  Add string beans; stir
to mix for only 15 seconds.  Add liquid ingredients; toss until liquid
is reduced to 1 T.  Serve on a warm plate.
