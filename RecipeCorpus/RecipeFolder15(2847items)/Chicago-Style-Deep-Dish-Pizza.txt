Categories: Pizza
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb mozzarella, sliced
1 lb sausage
28 oz can whole tomatoes
2 ea garlic cloves, minced
3 ts dried oregano, -or-
5 ea basil leaves, shredded
4 tb grated Parmesan cheese
1 ea Crust
1 c  warm water (110-115 deg)
1 pk Active dry yeast
3 1/2 c  flour
1/2 c  coarse ground cornmeal
1 ts salt
1/4 c  vegetable oil
1 ea Filling
Drain and coarsely crush the tomatoes. Remove sausage from casing and
crumble.  Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the
yeast with a fork. Add 1 cup of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and, and
vegetable oil.  Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest of
the flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes away from the sides of
the bowl.  Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed the ball of
dough until it is no longer sticky.  Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl,
sealed with plastic wrap, for 45 to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it
is doubled in bulk. Punch it down and kneed it briefly. Press it into an
oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches up the sides
and is even on the bottom of the pan.  Let the dough rise 15-20 minutes
before filling.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  While the dough is
rising, prepare the filling. Cook the crumbled sausage until it is no
longer pink, and drain it of it's excess fat. Drain and chop the tomatoes.
When the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over the
dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese.  Top
with the tomatoes.  Sprinkle on the seasonings and Parmesan cheese.  Bake
for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400 degrees
and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the crust from
time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The crust will be
golden brown when done.  Serve immediately.
