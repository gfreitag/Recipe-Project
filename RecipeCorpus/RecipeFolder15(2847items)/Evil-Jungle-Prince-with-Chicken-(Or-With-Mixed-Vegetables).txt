Categories: Thai, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Coconut milk
1/2 ts Salt
1    -to
4 tb Fish sauce,
- based on personal taste
- (omit for veggie version)
10    -to
15    Basil leaves

1/2 lb -Mixed vegetables,

2    -to
6 sm Red chile peppers
1/2    Stalk fresh lemon grass
2    Kaffir lime leaves
2 tb Oil
Thinly cut chicken into 2-inch strips.  (If doing veggie version, cut
vegetables into thin strips.) Grind together red chili peppers, lemon
grass, and kaffir lime leaves in a food processor or pound in a mortar.
Heat oil to medium-high and saute pepper mixture for 3 minutes.  Stir in
coconut milk and cook for 2 minutes.  Add chicken (or vegetables) and
cook for 5 minutes or until cooked (same time for veggies).  Reduce heat
to medium-low.  Stir in fish sauce (if using), salt, and basil.  Serve
on a bed of chopped cabbage.

Note:
=====
For mixed vegetables, choose from among bell peppers, string beans,
water chestnuts, tomatoes (small cherry tomatoes are best), bamboo
shoots, miniature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini, Japanese
eggplant, and mushrooms.  I particularly like string beans or asparagus,
a few cherry tomatoes, shredded (rather than sliced) bamboo shoots,
miniature corn, and some straw mushrooms or slender (Japanese) eggplant.

(3-4 servings)
