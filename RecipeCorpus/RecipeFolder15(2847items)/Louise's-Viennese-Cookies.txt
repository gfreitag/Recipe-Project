Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 16 servings
1/4 ts nutmeg
1 c  butter
1 ea egg
1 ea lemon rind, grated
1 ea preserves
1/2 c  almonds
1 1/2 c  unbleached flour
1/2 ts baking powder
1/8 c  molasses
1/3 c  maple syrup
Using a coffee grinder or a food processor, grind the almonds until
they are fine and powdery.  Combine flour and baking powder with
ground almonds.  Add molasses, maple syrup and nutmeg.  Cut in butter.
Work all ingredients together until crumbly.  In another bowl, beat
egg with lemon rind; add to dough and stir until evenly moist.  Remove
half of the dough, and spread it into a lightly oiled 9-inch square
pan.  Roll other half of dough into ball.  Refrigerate both for one
hour.  Spread preserves in even layer over dough in pan.  Using a
floured surface and a floured rolling pin, roll out the ball of dough.
Cut into 1/2-inch wide strips.  Place half of the strips vertically
and half of the strips horizontally over preserves in dough-lined pan,
leaving 1/2-inch between strips.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
