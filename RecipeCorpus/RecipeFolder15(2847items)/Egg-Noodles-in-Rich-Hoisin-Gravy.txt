Categories: Pasta, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb cornstarch
1/4 ts chili oil or to taste
1 lb fresh Chinese egg noodles
1 ds Salt
2 ea pickling cucumbers
3 c  Chicken broth or stock
1 1/2 c  Beans sprouts, blanched
3 tb hoisin sauce
2 tb soy sauce
1 tb Asian sesame oil, divided
2 tb peanut or vegetable oil
2 ea large cloves garlic, minced
1 tb minced ginger
1 lb pork, boneless loin, minced
1 tb Chinese rice wine
To prepare: pickling cucumbers, peel, seed, and cut into strips 1/8-inch
wide and 2-inches long.
Mix cornstarch with 4 tablespoons stock or water.
Cook's notes: The Chinese would use egg noodles, but you can
substitute readily available Japanese ramen noodles.
Hoisin sauce, Asian sesame oil and chili oil are available at Asian
markets or supermarkets with large Asian specialty sections.
Procedure: In a bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, half
the sesame oil and the chicken stock. Heat the peanut oil in a wok and
stir-fry the garlic and ginger for 45 seconds, or until soft. Add the pork
and stir-fry until nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Add the rice wine
and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the broth mixture and bring to a
boil.  Stir in the cornstarch mixture and return the entire mixture to a
boil; it will thicken slightly. Add chili oil to taste and keep the gravy
warm.
Cook the noodles in boiling salted water about 1 minute, or until done
to taste. Drain well and toss the noodles with the remaining sesame oil.
Presentation: Divide the noodles among bowls, pour the gravy over
them and garnish with bean sprouts and cucumber.
Yield: Makes 6 servings.
