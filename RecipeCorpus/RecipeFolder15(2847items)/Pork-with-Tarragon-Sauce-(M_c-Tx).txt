*These are in the original recipe, which also uses a 1 1/4 pound pork
tenderloin. I have modified it by using the chops. We also omit the salt
and use Mocha Mix or other non-dairy creamer for a "healthier" version (and
add 1 teaspoon corn starch to thicken) in place of cream. Cut tenderloin or
chops into 1 inch slices, trimming fat.  Place meat between sheets of waxed
paper and with side of fist, pound slightly to flatten. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper and brush with mustard.  Brown in melted butter in heavy skillet
(slowly), 5 minutes each side until pinkness disappears entirely. Remove
meat to heated platter and keep warm. Sprinkle tarragon over bottom of pan;
add beef broth and heat to boiling,whisking to scrape up brownings from
bottom of pan.  Boil 2 minutes. Add cream. Boil, whisking until reduced and
thickened.  If using non-dairy creamer, add corn starch to creamer first to
avoid lumps. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if desired. Pour sauce
over cooked meat and serve immediately. This recipe came from Debbie
Campbell, in Chicago, who put together a book of her families and friends'
favorites.  As we do now, I've tried some low-fat and no-sodium
modifications for us, and we still love it-- it's fast and very tasty!
