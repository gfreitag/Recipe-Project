Title: Crepes
Categories: Breakfast, Lowfat
Yield: 20 servings
1/2 ts Lite salt or less or none
2 c  Sifted flour
2 tb Canola oil
1 c  Cold water
1 c  Cold skim milk
6 ea Egg whites
Put liquids, egg whites and salt into a blender jar; add flour then oil.
Blend at top speed, scrapimg any flour adhering to the sides of the jar.
Cover, refrigerate 2 hours. This is an important step-it allows the flour
particles to expand in the liquid and insures a tender, thin crepe. The
batter should be a very light creamy texture-just thick enough to coat a
wooden spoon. For each crepe, heat 6" nonstick fry pan over moderatly high
heat. When hot, pour a scant 1/4 cup of the batter into the
skillet;immediatly rotate the pan until batter covers bottom. Cook until
light brown; turn and brown on the other side. Slide onto warm plate and
proceed in same manner with rest of batter. Put waxed paper between
crepes. Keep covered, as they cool, to prevent them from drying out. The
crepes are now ready to be filled. Makes 20 crepes, 6" each.

spresd with a low-fat filling and served cut in pie shaped wedges.
