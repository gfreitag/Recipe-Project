Title: To Cure Hams
Categories: Penndutch, Pork
Yield: 1 servings
3 oz Salt peter
1/2 lb Brown sugar
2 pt Salt
100 lb Ham
1 pt Salt, kosher
1 x  *also:
1/8 lb Pepper
*** The "recipe" specifies ham from corn-fed hogs, and "fine salt (best
quality)". Since kosher salt is commonly available today, and contains no
iodine, I changed the ingredients to specify it.
Mix thoroughly the salt peter, 1 pint salt and brown sugar and rub over the
hams and let stand for 24 hours. Then rub the meat with the pepper and part
of the remaining salt. Let stand for 5 days and then rub meat again with
fine salt. Set aside for 30 days, hang the meat up and brush off the salt.
Have hams smoked at a good smoke house, smoking them for 10 days with wood.
When finished, rub entire ham with red pepper, wrap carefully in brown
paper and then in muslin bags and hang up with the hock down. Hams prepared
in this manner will keep indefinitely, and flavor and quality improve with
time.
