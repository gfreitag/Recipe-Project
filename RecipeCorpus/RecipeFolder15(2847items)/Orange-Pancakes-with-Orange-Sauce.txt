Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Skim milk
3/4 c  Orange juice
1 tb Canola oil
1 1/2 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 ts Baking powder

These are a real treat for a leisurely weekend breakfast-beautiful and
very tasty. Four pancakes are stacked with layers of ricotta cheese
between them. A warm sauce with fresh orange sections is poured overall.
The pancake stack is served in wedges. See MM#54 for the orange sauce
recipe.
To Make The Pancakes: Combine flour, baking powder and orange rind. In a
separate bowl combine egg white, honey, milk, orange juice and oil. Stir
the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just enough to moisten. Bake
four large pancakes on a lightly oiled griddle.
To Assemble: Spread 1/3-1/2 cup ricotta cheese between each pancake and
pour half the orange sauce over the top. Cut into wedges and pour sauce
over individual wedges. Makes 6 servings.
