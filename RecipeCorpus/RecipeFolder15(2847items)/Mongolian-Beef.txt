Title: Mongolian Beef
Categories: Beef, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
-----------------------------MEAT PREPARATION:-----------------------------
1 1/2 tb water chestnut flour
2 ea egg whites
1 ea pinch salt
1 tb cornstarch paste
4 c  peanut oil
15 ea green onion tops
1 tb minced ginger
1 lb flank or sirloin steak
-----------------------------------SAUCE:-----------------------------------
1 ea pinch sugar
1 1/2 tb dry sherry
1 ts chili paste with garlic
1/4 c  chicken stock
2 tb dark soy sauce
Preparation:  Cut tops of green onions into 2" long pieces.  Combine
sauce ingredients in small bowl & stir thoroughly.  Cut steak across
the grain into thin slices, about 1/2" deep by 2" long.  In bowl big
enough to hold meat, combine egg whites, salt & water chestnut flour.
Beat with chopstick until frothy.  Add steak, & use fingers to coat
each slice.
Deep-frying:  In wok, heat oil to moderately hot.  When ready, piece
of coated meat will rise to surface immediately.  Fry meat in small
batches; drop in 1 slice at a time to avoid sticking.  Cook until
lightly brown, about 1 minute.  Drain on Chinese strainer or paper
bag.
Stir-frying:  Remove all but 2 T of oil from wok.  With wok at medium
heat, quickly stir-fry green onions & ginger for about 20 seconds.
Add sauce; bring to boil on high heat while stirring.  Add beef all at
once, & toss with sauce until beef is hot & coated.  Push beef out of
sauce, dribble in cornstarch paste to lightly thicken.  Recombine.
Serve immediately.
