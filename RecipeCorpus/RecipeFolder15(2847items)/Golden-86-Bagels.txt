Title: Golden 86 Bagels
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 16 servings
1 tb Sugar
1 ea Eggwash
1 1/2 c  Water, 110 deg f.
5 c  Whole wheat flour
2 tb Honey
1 pk Regular long-acting yeast
1 ts Salt
1 ea Large pot of boiling water
Dissolve honey in the water.  Add the yeast and proof.  Mix in salt
and flour.  Knead until gluten is formed.  Place dough in covered
bowl and let rise until almost doubled in bulk.  Punch down dough
and let rest five minutes.
Now the fun begins !  Divide the dough into 16-32 balls.  Roll ball
until smooth.  Poke your index finger through the dough's pudgy
middle and twirl around your finger until the hole is ~ 1 1/2"
across.  Place formed bagel on a cookie sheet and let rise while you
form the remaining bagels.
Add the 1 T sugar to the kettle of simmering water.  Gently lower
the bagel and turn, turn, turn, for ~ 5 minutes.  Simmer each bagel
until it is fully cooked (otherwise bagel will "fall").  Place
poached bagels on cookie sheet.
Brush bagels with eggwash.  Bake at ~375 degrees for 10-20 minutes,
or until golden brown.
