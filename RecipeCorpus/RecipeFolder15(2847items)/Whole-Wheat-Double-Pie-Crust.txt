Title: Whole Wheat Double Pie Crust
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  butter
1/4 c  apple juice
3/4 c  whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 c  unbleached white flour
Using knives, cut together flour and butter until butter is small marble-
sized.  Make a well, and quickly pour and cut in the juice.
Move the dough to a floured surface and gently knead together for two
minutes.  Separate into two balls for the top and bottom crusts.  Roll out
with floured rolling pin.  Place one on bottom and sides of 8 or 9-inch
pie plate.  Add pie filling and cover with top dough.  Seal edges and
prick top crust with fork so pie can breathe while cooking.
Bake at 350 degrees, 35-60 minutes, depending on filling.  Top crust will
be browned and possibly bubbling at the fork holes when finished.
Use one-half of this recipe for a one-crust pie.
Makes 1 double pie crust
