Title: Doris's Pralines
Categories: Cajun, Candies
Yield: 12 servings
1 cn Condensed milk
1 ts Vanilla
1 cn Water
4 c  Sugar
5 c  Pecans
4 tb Karo syrup
1 tb Butter
Mix all ingredients except butter, vanilla, and pecans.
Cook on low fire until the mixture forms a soft ball in
cold water.  Remove from fire.  Add butter, vanilla, and
pecans, and beat until the mixture holds its shape.  Spoon
onto buttered wax paper (Add old newspaper under your wax
paper.)
If candy gets hard before all is spooned out, add a little
water, and heat over.  Or you can let it stand on low heat
while spooning out.
If you have never tasted freshly made pralines, made from
fresh Louisiana pecans, you have just never really lived.
Justin Wilson says, "Doris is the much better half (wife)
of my good friend Gordon Martin, the sheriff of St. James
Parish.  Every Christmas Eve we go by to see them after
watching the bonfires that are burned on the levees along
the Mississippi River to light the way for Papa Noel (Santa Claus).
