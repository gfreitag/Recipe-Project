Title: Curach (Irish Honey-And-Oatmeal Cream)
Categories: Desserts, Irish
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Whiskey
12 oz Raspberries
2 oz Medium-grind oatmeal
10 fl Heavy cream
2 ts Runny honey
Toast the oatmeal on a cookie sheet under the broiler, or in a hot oven --
watch it carefully and stir it from time to time -- until it turns a pale
golden color.  Leave it to cool completely.  Whip the cream until it holds
its shape, stir in the honey and whiskey, then the cold toasted oatmeal.
Layer the raspberries and the cream mixture in the glasses, saving a few
of the berries for decoration on top.  Serve slightly cool.
