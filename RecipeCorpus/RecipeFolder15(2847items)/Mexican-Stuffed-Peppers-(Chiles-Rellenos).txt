Title: Mexican Stuffed Peppers (Chiles Rellenos)
Categories: Mexican, Beef
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Lard
2 tb Finely minced onions
8 oz Ground chuck
1 tb Minced parsley
2 tb Raisins
12 oz Flat beer
1    Egg beaten + 1 beaten white
Salt and pepper
8    Bell peppers
2    Green onions, minced
1 ts Minced garlic
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Minced cilantro
1/2 c  Grated  Monterey Jack
1 c  Flour
Oil for frying
Blacken the peppers over an open flame.  When cracked and black, put into a
paper or plastic bag (wait a minute if using plastic).  Secure the bag and
let stand for 30 minutes.  Peel the peppers under running water.  Make a
slit lengthwise down the pepper and carefully remove the seeds.  Melt the
lard in a pan and add the onions, green onions, garlic and ground beef.
Cook over high heat until well browned. Pour off excess fat and toss in the
thyme, parsley, cilantro and raisins.  Heat through and divide the mixture
among half of the peppers. Secure with toothpicks and stuff the remaining
peppers with grated cheese. Beat the beer into the flour and add the egg to
form a batter.  Let stand for at least 30 minutes, correcting the texture
with an additional egg yolk or more flour. Heat the oil to 350 degrees. Dip
each pepper into the batter allowing excess to run off.  Fry the peppers
until golden, drain well and serve one of each pepper per person.
