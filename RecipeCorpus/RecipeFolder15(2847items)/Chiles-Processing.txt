1 ea HINTS AND TIPS FOR CHILES
In these recipes, the chiles and tomatoes can be toasted by holding them
over an open flame and charring the peel on all sides, or they can be
roasted, by placing them under a broiler and turning occasionally until
charred all over.  In either case, the peppers are wrapped in moist cloth
or place in a wet bag for a while before peeling the skins off. The
tomatoes can be peeled as soon as they are cool enough to handle. Salsa
cruda means Raw Sauces. These are all uncooked and based on chiles and
tomatoes.
