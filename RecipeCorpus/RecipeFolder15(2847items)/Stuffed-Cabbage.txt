Cut a slice from base of cabbage so it will stand. Remove any damaged outer
leaves. Stand on rack in sink and slowly pour boiling water over to loosen
leaves. Push leaves back with wooden spoon until you get to the heart. Mix
the ground meats, chopped onion, garlic and parsley, herbs (except bay
leaves), seasoning and eggs in large bowl.  Work together with hands until
thoroughly blended. Stuff an reshape the cabbage, starting with the heart.
Hold leaves together with toothpicks and tie securely with criss-crossed
pieces of string.  Line the inside of a deep heavy dutch oven with slices
of bacon, scatter over them the sliced onion, carrot and celery. Stand the
stuffed cabbage on top, sprinkle with a little salt and pepper, add the bay
leaves and stock.  Cover pan with lid and seal with a thick flour and water
paste.  Cook in a 275 degree oven for about 3 hours.  Remove and allow to
stand for 5 minutes before carefully removing the cover. To serve, place
the cabbage in a shallow round platter, strain juices over it and cut into
wedge-shaped pieces, like a cake.
