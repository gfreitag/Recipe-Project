Categories: Candies, Desserts, Snacks
Yield: 10 servings
2    Egg whites (may need more)
Water
Powdered sugar
40    Apple or Pineapple Mint
-Leaves (select tender
-leaves with no blemishes)
The large downy leaves of the apple and pineapple mint leaves take up this
coating very well which will not readily adhere to most of the varieties of
the mint. This is a nice confection that has many uses.
**********************************************************************
Froth up the egg whites with a little water. With a small brush, paint the
leaves with the egg white and dust both sides with the powdered sugar. Set
each leaf on a sheet of wax paper and allow to dry. They will dry with a
frosty crystalized coating and make a nice garnish for desserts or a
pleasant candy treat.
