Similar to a souffle, but really a lovely mushroom casserole. Our version
of a quiche-good brunch item. Serve with tiny muffins and fresh fruit.
Eariler in the day or the day before: Saute mushrooms, onions, celery and
green pepper in margarine until tender. Drain off excess liquid. Remove
from heat and add yogurt and mayonnaise. Lightly oil a 9-by-13 inch baking
dish. Line bottom with quartered bread (use half the quarters, remove
crusts if desired). Pour vegetable/yogurt mixture over bread. Add remaining
bread to form another layer. Mix egg substitute and milk and pour over
bread. Cover and refrigerate one hour or longer. Overnight is fine.
One Hour Before Serving: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Combine soup and
milk and spread over casserole. Top with grated cheese and bake 1 hour.
Garnish with parsley and paprika. Allow to set for a few minutes before
cutting into squares. Serve warm. Makes 9 servings(about 3 by 4 inches).
