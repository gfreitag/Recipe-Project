Thaw large shrimp, if fozen.  To shell fresh or thawed shrimp, open each
shell lengthwise down the body.  Hold the shrimp in one hand and carefully
peel back the shell starting with the head end.  Gently pull on the tail
portion of the shell to remove the entire shell.  Butterfly shrimp by
cutting down the back almost but not all the way through; remove vein.
Repeat with remaining shrimp.  Set aside.  In a small nonmetal bowl,
micro-cook sliced green onion and the butter or margarine, uncovered, on
100% power for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or till the green onion is tender.  Stir
in lemon juice and bottled hot pepper sauce.  Toss with the flaked crab
meat and fine dry bread crumbs.  Spread shrimp open.  Place, cut side up,
in two 10-ounce oval casseroles.  Cover with vented clear plastic wrap.
Micro-cook, covered, on 100% power for 1 1/2 minutes, rotating the
casseroles a half-turn once.  Drain off liquid and rearrange shrimp,
placing the least-cooked portions to the outside of the casseroles.  Spoon
crab mixture over shrimp.  Micro-cook, covered, on 100% power about 2 1/2
minutes or till shrimp are done and crab mixture is heated through,
rotating the casseroles a half-turn once.  Serve with lemon wedges.
