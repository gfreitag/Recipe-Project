Title: Pasta with Pork & Basil
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
Fresh basil, parsley, chives
8 oz Fusilli or other fresh pasta
6 oz Mushrooms
-----------------------------FOR THE MEATBALLS-----------------------------
Garlic
1/2 sm Egg; lightly beaten
A little butter or oil
1 lb Lean freshly minced pork
Parmesan cheese
Fresh basil
-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
1/2 pt (scant) stock
Parmesan cheese
Dijon mustard
1/2 oz Butter
1 1/2 tb Plain flour
1/4 pt Double cream
Mix all the meatball ingredients thoroughly; I season the meat with 1
tablespoon grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil and 1 smallish garlic
clove, as well as salt and pepper.  Flour your hands and shape the mixture
into about 32 small balls.  Fry in batches in a non-stick pan for 5 minutes
or more until golden and cooked right through.  Shake the pan frequently so
the meatballs keep in good shape and cook evenly.  Transfer to a casserole
and keep hot.

Slice the mushrooms thickly, saute' them well and add them to the
meatballs.  Then "wash out" the frying pan with the chicken stock.  Make a
smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock and cream.  Add any juices
that have collected in the casserole and simmer for several minutes. Away
from the heat, season with salt and pepper, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1
heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard.  Pour the sauce over the meatballs, cover
and keep hot in a low oven.  The mixture can be kept hot for some time
without spoiling, or it can be prepared ahead and reheated close to
serving.

Boil the pasta until al dente and drain well.  Add it to the casserole
together with a small handful of fresh herbs -- about 2 tablespoons each
basil and chives, and 1 of parsley -- and toss gently to mix well. Garnish
with more basil, and serve with an undressed salad.
