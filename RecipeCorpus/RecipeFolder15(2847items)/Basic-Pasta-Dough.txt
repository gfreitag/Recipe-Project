Categories: Pasta, Main dish, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Salt
3 c  Flour
5    Eggs
3 tb Olive oil
Add salt, olive oil, and eggs to food processor. Pulse to combine.
Gradually add flour, pulsing to mix.
The pasta machine will thin and cut the dough. Start with a small piece of
dough and knead it down until fairly flat. Feed it through the machine at
the #1 setting. It is thin enough to use when you can see your hand behind
it. Cut the dough into about 12 pieces. Let dry on paper toweling. When
dry run the dough through the machine to cut it.
