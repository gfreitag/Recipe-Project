Title: Bird's Nest Soup
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  rich chicken stock
2 ea egg whites
1 ts salt
2 ea green onions, minced
1 tb minced Smithfield ham
3 1/2 oz (approx) dried bird's nest
6 c  rich chicken stock for soup
1 ea large chicken breast
2 tb cornstarch
2 tb rich chicken stock for paste
1 tb dry sherry
Preparation:  Soak bird's nest in cold water overnight.  Drain and
rinse.  Spread softened nest pieces on plate; pick out prominent
pieces of "foreign" matter (e.g. feathers, twigs) with tweezers.
Debone chicken breast, remove membrane and muscle fiber, pound meat
with cleaver handle to break down tissue, mince chicken until it is
pulp.  Make medium thick paste with cornstarch and chicken stock.
Cooking:  Bring rich chicken stock for soup to boil.  Immediately add
bird's nest; simmer 30 minutes.  Mix dry sherry and remaining stock;
dribble slowly into minced chicken.  Lightly beat egg whites with a
fork; fold gently into chicken so they are not completely blended.
Add salt to soup.  Bring soup back to boil and add chicken mixture
slowly so soup does not cool.  When soup returns to boil, it is ready
to serve.  You can hold it at this point on low heat.  Pour into
serving bowl, garnish with green onions and ham.  Serves 6
