Title: The Perfect Buttermilk Biscuits
Categories: Breakfast, Breads
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Shortening
2 1/4 c  Flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
Place shortening in small plastic food bag. Flatten shortening between
plastic sheets so it is thin and return to freezer. This allows shortening
to become hard enough to break, into tiny pieces when added to dry
ingredients. Tear 2 pieces wax paper about 15 inches long and place on
counter, Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt onto wax
paper. Place empty sifter on top of bare sheet of wax paper, lift sheet of
wax paper holding sifted dry ingredients by sides and pour through sifter,
sifting onto bare wax paper. Sift back and forth 3 times, then sift once
more into large mixing bowl. Remove shortening from freezer. Cut into small
bits, about 1/4-inch square. Drop shortening bits into bowl of dry
ingredients and, using fingertips, lightly rub shortening and flour
together, occasionally tossing flour mixture so you touch all particles of
shortening with flour. When mixture has bits of flour-covered shortening
throughout, begin adding buttermilk. Using fork, add buttermilk, lightly
stirring to mix with dry ingredients. Cover board or surface with dusting
of flour. Gather sticky mass of dough and place on floured surface. Dust
hands with flour and gently knead dough, adding enough flour only to make
dough manageable. Pat dough with hands or roll with floured rolling pin
into round 1/2-inch thick. Using 2-inch cutter, cut out biscuits and place
touching each other in 3 rows, in center of greased baking sheet. Place on
middle rack of 425-degree oven and bake 12 minutes, or until lightly
golden. Remove from oven and serve hot or warm. Makes 19 (2-inch round)
biscuits.
