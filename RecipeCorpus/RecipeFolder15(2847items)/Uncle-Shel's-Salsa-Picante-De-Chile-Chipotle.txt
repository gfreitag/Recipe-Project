Title: Uncle Shel's Salsa Picante De Chile Chipotle
Categories: Salsa
Yield: 12 servings
3/4 c  water
1/2 c  cider vinegar
1 ea clove garlic
4 ea chipotle chiles
3 ea pasilla negro chiles
4 ea cascabel chiles
1/4 ts fresh ground black pepper
4 ea chipotle chiles, stemmed and quartered including seeds
3 ea pasilla negro chiles, stemmed and quartered including seeds
4 ea cascabel chiles, stemmed and broken, including seeds
1/4 ts fresh ground black pepper
3/4 c  water
1/2 c  cider vinegar or Japanese rice vinegar
1 ea clove garlic, smashed and quartered
Place the chiles and their seeds in a small blender jar, add the garlic and
the black pepper.  Mix the vinegar and the water together and heat until
the mixture is just ready to boil, and add it to the peppers.  Tightly
close the jar and let the ingredients steep for at least 1/2 an hour.  Then
puree until smooth.
This makes a tangy, tasty and thick salsa.  The rice vinegar makes a
somewhat mellower salsa than the cider vinegar.  You could also use a
distilled vinegar, or play around with the proportions of vinegar and water
to achieve your own pucker level.
