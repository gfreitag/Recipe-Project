Title: Irish Stew (1) [Ballymaloe]
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Irish, Stew
Yield: 4 servings
4 x  Potatoes
1 x  Salt and pepper
2 1/2 c  Stock or water
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 tb Chopped chives
3 lb Lamb neck chops
4 x  Med-sized carrots
4 x  Med-sized onions
1 tb Butter
1 x  Lamb fat or beef dripping
Shred some of the lamb fat and render it down in a heavy casserole.  Peel
onions and potatoes, scrape carrots.  Cut the meat into 8 pieces;  only
the excess fat is cut away.  Bones need not be removed.  Cut the carrots
and onions in quarters.  Toss meat in fat until color changes, and repeat
with onions and carrots.  Add stock and season carefully.  Put whole
potatoes on top.  Simmer gently until the meat is cooked, 2 hours approx.
Pour off the cooking liquid.  Degrease, and reheat in another saucepan.
Check seasoning.  Then swirl in butter, chives, parsley, and pour back
over stew.
