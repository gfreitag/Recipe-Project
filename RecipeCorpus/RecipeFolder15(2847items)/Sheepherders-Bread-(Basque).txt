Categories: Breads
Yield: 20 servings
2 pk Yeast
9 c  Flour (to 9 1/2 cups)
Salad oil
3 c  Hot tap water
1/2 c  Butter
1/3 c  Sugar
2 1/2 ts Salt
In a large bowl, combine hot water, butter, sugar and salt. Stir to
melt butter. Let cool to 110 deg f. Stir in yeast, cover, and set in warm
place until bubbly (about 15 minutes).
Beat in about 5 cups flour to make thick batter. Stir in enough flour to
make a stiff dough (about 3 1/2 cups). Turn dough out onto a floured board
and knead for 10 to 20 minutes, adding flour as needed to prevent
sticking. Place dough in a greased bowl and cover. Place in a warm area
and let rise until doubled in size.
Punch dough down and knead briefly on floured board to release air. Shape
into a smooth ball. With a circle of aluminum foil lining the bottom of a
5 quart dutch oven, greased sides, foil on bottom and lid with salad oil.
Place dough in dutch oven and cover. Let rise in warm place until lid
rises up about 1/2 inch (about one hour).
Bake, with lid on, at 375 deg f for 12 minutes. Remove lid and bake
another 30 minutes or until loaf is golden brown. Remove from oven and
turn out onto wire rack. Peel foil from bottom and set loaf upright. Makes
1 very large loaf. Happy eating.
