Title: Home Baked Beans
Categories: Penndutch, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 lb Salt pork
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Water, boiling
1 pt Navy beans
1 ts Mustard, dry
1 tb Molasses
1 1/2 tb Sugar
Cover beans with cold water and soak over night. Change the water and cook
at slightly below boiling point until skins burst. To test beans, take a
few and expose them to cold air; if shells burst, they are sufficiently
cooked. Drain off the water and add the salt pork which has been cut into
strips. Put in bean pot, having some of the salt pork slices on top. Mix
the mustard, sugar, salt, and molasses together and add to the beans. Add
the boiling water. Cover pot and bake at 250-F about 6 hours, removing the
cover during the last hour.
