-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
1/4 c  Milk
2/3 c  Stock
1 ts Dry sherry
Preparation:  Wash cauliflower, and cut florets about twice the size of
straw mushrooms.  Dice green onions into 1/4" pieces.  Mix stock & sherry.
Cooking:  Heat first oil to medium hot.  Add garlic & stir for about 30
seconds.  Remove garlic before it begins to brown.  Turn heat high; add
cauliflower.  Stir-fry for about 1 minute.  Add onion, salt & sugar;
stir-fry 30 seconds.  Stir in Tientsin cabbage.  If desired, add shrimp or
crab meat. Immediately add stock & sherry; bring sauce to boil, mixing with
cauliflower.  Cover & simmer 4 minutes.  Remove lid; thicken with
cornstarch.  Sauce should be very heavy, so that when milk is added, it
will thin slightly, but still have body.  Bring sauce back to boil; slowly
add milk while stirring.  Add remaining peanut oil for a final glaze.
Serve.  Serves 4
