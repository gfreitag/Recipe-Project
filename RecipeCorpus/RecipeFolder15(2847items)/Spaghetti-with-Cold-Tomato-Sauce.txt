Yield: 8 servings
2    Garlic cloves
3 tb Olive oil
6    Basil leaves
1 1/2 lb Spaghetti
1    Yellow bell pepper
Salt and pepper
1 lb Fresh plum tomatoes

Put the pepper in a flame or under a broiler to char the skin all over.
Remove the skin, cut open the pepper, remove the seeds and finely dice the
flesh.  Put in a small bowl with the lightly crushed garlic, a pinch of
salt and pepper and the oil; mix well. Plunge the tomatoes into boiling
water for 1 minutes, slide off the skins and dice the flesh. Put into a

Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente; drain
well.  Mix with the cold sauce and serve at once. Serves 8.
