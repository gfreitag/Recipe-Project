4 lb Wet modeling clay
3 1/2 lb Frying chicken
3    Dried lotus leaves
----------------------------------STUFFING----------------------------------
1 tb Peanut oil
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Fresh ginger root, minced
1/2 lb Ground pork
2 tb Salted mustard green

------------------------------MIXTURE FOR SKIN------------------------------
1 ts Sesame oil

1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Medium sherry
Prepare Chicken:  Trim excess fat from chicken; remove wing tips.  Mix
mixture for skin; rub chicken inside & out with it.  Leave uncovered at
room temperature, while coating is absorbed and dried.  Repeat if
necessary.  Stuffing:  In hot wok, heat peanut oil to smoking.  Stir- fry
ground pork 2 minutes; add mustard green, ginger & sugar; stir-fry 1 more
minute.  Remove & cool. Lotus Leaves: Number of leaves depends on their
size & that of chicken. Reduce heat under boiling water to simmer, & steep
leaves for 3-5 minutes, until wet through & pliable (no longer or leaves
may shred). Now soak in cold water for 10 minutes, or longer, until time to
use them; open folded leaves in cold water to wash them. Wrap Chicken:
Preheat oven to 550 degrees.  Stuff chicken with pork mixture. Cut hard
center out of lotus leaves, then slit along fold about 3" on each side of
center, so cut away center can be overlapped. Wrap chicken in 3 layers of
lotus leaves.  Tie securely with piece of cotton or fiber string (don't use
nylon; it might melt).  Spread soft, wet modeling clay about 1/2" thick on
sheet of newspaper.  Bring clay pack around chicken & seal. Remove
newspaper.  (Use foil if clay unavailable.) Roasting: Place clay-covered
chicken on rack in shallow roasting pan in preheated oven. Bake for 1 hour;
reduce heat to 350 degrees & bake for another 1 1/2 hours. Serve: Present
fired clay chicken to table.  Crack clay with suitable object, allowing
some of steam to escape before you proceed.  Remove clay; carefully cut
open lotus leaves with scissors.  Chicken will be very soft & tender; break
apart to get at stuffing.  Serve guests, or invite them to pick with
chopsticks.  Serves 4
