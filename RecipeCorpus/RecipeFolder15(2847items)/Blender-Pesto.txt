Title: Blender Pesto
Categories: Sauces, Pasta, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Cheese, parmesan; grated
2 tb Cheese, romano; grated
3 tb Butter
2 c  Basil leaves, fresh packed
1/2 c  Oil, olive
2 tb Pine nuts
2 ea Garlic cloves; peeled
Put the basil, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic cloves and salt in the blender
or food processor, (I use the food processor), and mix at high speed. Stop
from time to time and scrape the ingredients down toward
the bottom with a rubber spatula. When the ingredients are evenly blended,
pour into a bowl and beat in the two grated cheeses by hand.  (This is not
much work, and it results in a more interesting texture
and better flavor than you get when you mix in the cheese in the blender.)
When the cheese has been evenly incorporated into the other ingredients,
beat in the butter (softened to room temperature). Before spooning the
pesto over pasta, add to it a tablespoon or so of the hot water in which
the pasta has been cooked.
Katie's Note: Pesto freezes very well, so I make as much of it as I
can when basil is in season. (Basil is also very easy to grow, and
produces a lot). Spoon each serving (about 3 T) into small muffin tins and
freeze. When frozen, pop out cubes and put in plastic bags. This way, if
you are just cooking for yourself, or for more, it's always available. I
try to have enough on hand in the freezer in September,
so I can have it, one way or another, once a week or so until about
the next July, when I can begin to harvest my next crop.
