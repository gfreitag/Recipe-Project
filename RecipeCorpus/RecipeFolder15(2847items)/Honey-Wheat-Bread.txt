Title: Honey Wheat Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 32 servings
2 tb Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water
2 c  White flour
5 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Skim milk
1/4 c  Canola oil
1/4 c  Honey or less
1/2 ts Lite salt
Heat milk until bubbles form around the edge. Add oil and stir. Add honey
and lite salt and stir until well blended. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast
in warm water for 30 minutes. Add milk mixture. Add all of white flour and
half of whole wheat flour, about 3 cups. Stir until well mixed.  Gradually
add the rest of the whole wheat flour. Stir at first, then mix with hands
until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Let rest for ten minutes. Turn
dough out onto a lightly floured board. Knead, push and fold until dough
is soft and springy to touch(about 10 minutes) and return to bowl. Cover
the bowl, allowing room for the dough to double in bulk. Let rise in warm
area(about 80-85 degrees) for 1 1/2 hours or until dough has doubled in
size. Divide dough in half and let rest 10 minutes. Form into a oblong
shape the length of the loaf pan, pinching the dough together tightly at
the seams. Lightly oil two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans. Place dough seam side
down, in the pans. Cover the pans to protect from draft and let the loaves
rise once more until they have doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees toward the end of the rising period. When the bread has risen
until it is just above the rim, it is ready for baking. Bake for 50
minutes. When you remove it from the pan and tap it on the sides or
bottom it should sound slightly hollow. The color should be  a rich golden
brown. Makes two loaves(32 slices).
