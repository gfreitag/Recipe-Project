Title: Chicken Breast for 1
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 cn cream-of-whatever soup
1 c  water
1/2 ea chicken breast
1/4 c  uncooked converted rice
1 c  frozen mixed vegatables
Chicken breast to be with bone but no skin. Completely line a small baking
pan (I use a 7 x 11 x 1.5 inch) with aluminum foil, letting the foil line
even the sides.  Place another, double layer of foil in the bottom of the
pan.  Place chicken tit (thats half a chicken breast for you married types
out there) on one side of the pan.  Pour rice on the other half, then pour
frozen veggies on top of rice.  Spoon dollops of soup on chicken and
veggies, then pour a layer of water over all (3/4 cup should do it).
Cover pan with aluminum foil.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1
hour.  Uncover...well look at that...you have chicken, rice, and
vegatables in a nice sauce.  Transfer to plate.  Eat.  Lift out foil
lining and throw away.  You're done!
