Categories: Cookies, Snacks, Desserts
Yield: 24 servings
----------------------------------COOKIES----------------------------------
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Red food coloring
1 c  Shortening (half butter or
-Margarine if desired)
1 c  Sifted powdered sugar
1    Egg
1 1/2 ts Almond extract
----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
1/2 c  Crushed peppermint candies
1/2 c  Sugar
Heat oven to 375 deg f. Mix shortening, sugar, egg, and flavorings
thoroughly. Measure flour by dipping method or by sifting. Mix flour and
salt. Stir flour mix into shortening mix. Divide dough into two equal
parts. Blend red food coloring into one half of the dough.
Roll a 4" (use one tablespoon of dough) strip from each color dough. For a
smooth strip, roll back and forth on a lightly floured board. Place strips
side by side on table, press together lightly and then twist like a rope.
For best results do one cookie at a time because dough will dry out if you
roll all of one color at a time. Place cookie on baking sheet and curve
end to form a cane. When cookie sheet is full Bake for about 9 minutes or
until lightly browned. While cookies are still warm, sprinkle with a
mixture of sugar and crushed candy.
Makes about 48 cookies.
