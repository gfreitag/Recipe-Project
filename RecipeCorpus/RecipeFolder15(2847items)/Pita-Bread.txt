1/2 c  Skim milk
1 c  Luke warm water
1 tb Active dry yeast

Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of warm water. Let stand 5-10 minutes.
Place flours and lite salt in a large bowl, making a depression in the

sides of bowl is worked into dough. Knead until a smooth dough results and
the sides of the bowl are clean. (Occasionally dip hands in more water
while kneading to give a smooth, elastic finish.) Cover with towel and let
dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size (2-4 hours). Form into
16 smooth balls. Cover and let rise on a cloth for 30 minutes.. Roll into
1/4" thick circles. Cover and let rise again on cloth for 30 minutes.

soon as the dough rises into a mound, 2-5 minutes, place under broiler for
a few seconds until lightly browned. Cool. Makes 16 pitas.
